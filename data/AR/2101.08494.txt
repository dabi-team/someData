Spectra and mean multiplicities of π− in
central 40Ar+45Sc collisions at 13A, 19A,
30A, 40A, 75A and 150A GeV/c beam
momenta measured by the NA61/SHINE
spectrometer at the CERN SPS

The NA61/SHINE Collaboration

The physics goal of the strong interaction program of the NA61/SHINE experiment at
the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is to study the phase diagram of hadronic
matter by a scan of particle production in collisions of nuclei with various sizes at
a set of energies covering the SPS energy range. This paper presents diﬀerential
inclusive spectra of transverse momentum, transverse mass and rapidity of π− mesons
produced in central 40Ar+45Sc collisions at beam momenta of 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A,
75A and 150A GeV/c. Energy and system size dependence of parameters of these
distributions – mean transverse mass, the inverse slope parameter of transverse mass
spectra, width of the rapidity distribution and mean multiplicity – are presented and
discussed. Furthermore, the dependence of the ratio of the mean number of produced
pions to the mean number of wounded nucleons on the collision energy was derived.
The results are compared to predictions of several models.

1 Introduction

This paper presents measurements of the NA61/SHINE experiment on spectra and mean multi-
plicities of π− mesons produced in central 40Ar+45Sc collisions at beam momenta of 13A, 19A,
30A, 40A, 75A and 150A GeV/c. These studies form part of the strong interactions program of
NA61/SHINE [1, 2] investigating the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement and searching for
the possible existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. The
program is mainly motivated by the observation of rapid changes of hadron production properties
in central Pb+Pb collisions at about 30A GeV/c by the NA49 experiment [3, 4], namely a sharp
peak in the Kaon to pion ratio ("horn"), the start of a plateau in the inverse slope parameter
for Kaons ("step"), and a steepening of the increase of pion production per wounded nucleon
with increasing collision energy ("kink"). These ﬁndings were predicted as signals of the onset of
deconﬁnement [5]. They were recently conﬁrmed by the RHIC beam energy program [6] and the
interpretation is supported by the LHC results (see Ref. [7] and references therein).

The goals of the NA61/SHINE strong interaction program are pursued experimentally by a two
dimensional scan in collision energy and nuclear mass number of colliding nuclei. This allows to
explore systematically the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter [2]. In particular, the
analysis of the existing data within the framework of statistical models suggests that by increasing
collision energy one increases temperature and decreases baryon chemical potential of strongly
interacting matter at freeze-out [8], whereas by increasing nuclear mass number of the colliding
nuclei one decreases the temperature [9, 8, 10].

Within this program NA61/SHINE recorded data on p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La and Pb+Pb
collisions. Further high statistics measurements of Pb+Pb collisions are planned with an upgraded
detector starting in 2022 [11]. Results on π− spectra and multiplicities have already been published
from p+p interactions [12, 13] and 7Be+9Be collisions [14, 15]. The latter provide the basic
reference of a light isospin zero system for the study of dense matter eﬀects in collisions of heavier
nuclei.

In this paper the so-called h− method is used for determining π− production since it provides the
largest phase space coverage. This procedure utilizes the fact that negatively charged particles are
predominantly π− mesons with a small admixture (of order 10%) of K− mesons and anti-protons
which can be reliably subtracted.

The paper is organized as follows: after this introduction the experiment is brieﬂy described in
Sec. 2. The analysis procedure is discussed in Sec. 3. Section 4 presents the results of the analysis.
In Sec. 5 the new measurements are compared to model calculations. The relevance of the new
results for the study of the onset of deconﬁnement is discussed in Sec. 6. A summary and outlook
in Sec. 7 closes the paper.

The following variables and deﬁnitions are used in this paper. The particle rapidity y is calculated
in the nucleon-nucleon collision center of mass system (cms), y = 0.5 ln [(E + cpL)/(E − cpL)],
where E and pL are the particle energy and longitudinal momentum, respectively. The transverse
component of the momentum is denoted as pT, and the transverse mass mT is deﬁned as
mT = pm2 + (cpT)2, where m is the particle mass in GeV. The momentum in the laboratory
frame is denoted plab and the collision energy per nucleon pair in the center of mass by

sN N .

√

The Ar+Sc collisions are selected by requiring a low value of the forward energy - the energy
emitted into the region populated by projectile spectators. These collisions are referred to as
central collisions and a selection of collisions based on the forward energy is called a centrality
selection. Although for Ar+Sc collisions the forward energy is not tightly correlated with the
impact parameter of the collision, the terms central and centrality are adopted following the
convention widely used in heavy-ion physics.

Figure 1: The schematic layout of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS [1] showing the
components used for the Ar+Sc energy scan (horizontal cut, not to scale). The trigger detector conﬁguration
upstream of the target is shown in the inset. Alignment of the chosen coordinate system is shown on the
plot; its origin lies in the middle of VTPC-2, on the beam axis. The nominal beam direction is along
the z-axis. The magnetic ﬁeld bends charged particle trajectories in the x–z (horizontal) plane. The drift
direction in the TPCs is along the (vertical) y-axis.

The NA61/SHINE detector (see Fig. 1) is a large-acceptance hadron spectrometer situated in
the North Area H2 beam-line of the CERN SPS [1]. The main components of the detection
system used in the analysis are four large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPC). Two of
them, called Vertex TPCs (VTPC), are located downstream of the target inside superconducting
magnets with maximum combined bending power of 9 Tm. The magnetic ﬁeld was scaled down
in proportion to the beam momentum in order to obtain similar phase space acceptance at all
energies. The main TPCs (MTPC) and two walls of pixel Time-of-Flight (ToF-L/R) detectors
are placed symmetrically on either side of the beamline downstream of the magnets. The TPCs
are ﬁlled with Ar:CO2 gas mixtures in proportions 90:10 for the VTPCs and 95:5 for the MTPCs.
The Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) is positioned 20.5 m (16.7 m) downstream of the
MTPCs at beam momenta of 75A and 150A GeV/c (13A, 19A, 30A, 40A GeV/c), centered in the
transverse plane on the deﬂected position of the beam. Moreover a brass cylinder of 10 cm (30A –
150A GeV/c) or 5 cm (19A GeV/c) length and 5 cm diameter (degrader) was placed in front of
the center of the PSD in order to reduce electronic saturation eﬀects and shower leakage from the
downstream side.

Primary beams of fully ionized 40Ar nuclei were extracted from the SPS accelerator at beam
momenta of 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A and 150A GeV/c. Two scintillation counters, S1 and S2,
provide beam deﬁnition, together with a veto counter V1 with a 1 cm diameter hole, which deﬁnes
the beam before the target. The S1 counter provides also the timing reference (start time for

S1 ∧ S2 ∧ V1. Individual beam particle trajectories are precisely measured by the three beam
position detectors (BPDs) placed upstream of the target [1]. Collimators in the beam line were
adjusted to obtain beam rates of ≈ 104/s during the ≈ 10 s spill and a cycle time of 32.4 s.

The target was a stack of 2.5 x 2.5 cm2 area and 1 mm thick 45Sc plates of 6 mm total thickness

measured to be 0.3 %. Their inﬂuence on the pion multiplicity was estimated to be an increase
by less than 0.2 % caused by the admixture of heavier elements [16]. No correction was applied
for this negligible contamination. Data were taken with target inserted (denoted I) and target
removed (denoted R).

Interactions in the target are selected with the trigger system by requiring an incoming 40Ar ion
and a signal below that of beam ions from S5, a small 2 cm diameter scintillation counter placed
on the beam trajectory behind the MTPCs. This minimum bias trigger is based on the breakup of
the beam ion due to interactions in and downstream of the target. In addition, central collisions
were selected by requiring an energy signal below a set threshold from the 16 central modules of
the PSD which measure mainly the energy carried by projectile spectators. The cut was set to
retain only the events with the ≈ 30% smallest energies in the PSD. The event trigger condition
thus was T2 = T1∧S5 ∧ PSD. The statistics of recorded events are summarized in Table 1.

3 Analysis procedure

This section starts with a brief overview of the data analysis procedure and the applied corrections.
It also deﬁnes to which class of particles the ﬁnal results correspond. A description of the
calibration and the track and vertex reconstruction procedure can be found in Ref. [12].

The analysis procedure consists of the following steps:

(i) application of event and track selection criteria,

(ii) determination of spectra of negatively charged hadrons using the selected events and tracks,

(iii) evaluation of corrections to the spectra based on experimental data and simulations,

(iv) calculation of the corrected spectra and its parameters,

(v) calculation of statistical and systematic uncertainties.

Corrections for the following biases were evaluated and applied when signiﬁcant:

(i) contribution from oﬀ-target interactions,

(ii) procedure of selecting central collisions,

(iii) geometrical acceptance,

(iv) contribution of particles other than primary (see below) negatively charged pions produced

in Ar+Sc interactions,

(v) losses of produced negatively charged pions due to their decays and secondary interactions.

Correction (i) was found to be negligible and was therefore not applied. Corrections (ii)-(v) are
estimated by simulations. Events were generated with the Epos1.99 model (version CRMC
1.5.3) [17, 18, 19], passed through detector simulation employing the Geant3 package [20]
and then reconstructed by the standard NA61/SHINE program chain. Event selection in the
simulation was based on the number of projectile spectator nucleons which is available from the
Epos1.99 model.

The ﬁnal results refer to π− produced in central Ar+Sc interactions by strong interaction processes
and in electromagnetic decays of produced hadrons. Such hadrons are referred to as primary
hadrons. The deﬁnition of central collisions is given in Sec. 3.1.

3.1 Central collisions

A short description of the procedure deﬁning central collisions is given below. For more details
see Ref. [21].

Final results presented in this paper refer to the 5% of Ar+Sc collisions with the lowest value of
the forward energy EF (central collisions). The quantity EF is deﬁned as the total energy in the
laboratory system of all particles produced in Ar+Sc collisions via strong and electromagnetic
processes in the forward momentum region deﬁned by the acceptance map in Ref. [22]. Final results
on central collisions, derived using this procedure, allow a precise comparison with predictions of
models without any additional information about the NA61/SHINE setup and used magnetic

ﬁeld. Using this deﬁnition the mean number of wounded nucleons hW i was calculated within the
Wounded Nucleon Model (WNM) [23] as implemented in Epos.

event selection. The trigger is derived from the energy in the central 16 modules (1-16) in blue color.
Determination of the PSD energy EPSD uses the green (150A GeV/c), orange (75A, 40A, 30A GeV/c) or all
modules (19A, 13A GeV/c) at the respective beam momenta.

For analysis of the data the event selection was based on the ≈ 5% of collisions with the lowest
value of the energy EPSD measured by a subset of PSD modules (see Fig. 2) in order to optimize
the sensitivity to projectile spectators. The acceptance resulting from the deﬁnition of the forward
energy EF corresponds closely to the acceptance of this subset of PSD modules.

Online event selection by the hardware trigger (T2) used a threshold on the sum of electronic
signals from the 16 central modules of the PSD set to accept ≈ 30% of the inelastic interactions.
Measured distributions of EPSD for minimum-bias and T2 trigger selected events, calculated in the
oﬄine analysis, are shown in Fig. 3 at beam momenta of 19A GeV/c and 150A GeV/c, respectively.
The accepted region corresponding to the 5% most central collisions is indicated by shading. The
minimum-bias distribution was obtained using the data from the beam trigger T1 with oﬄine
selection of events by requiring an event vertex in the target region. A properly normalized
spectrum for target removed events was subtracted.

The forward energy EF cannot be measured directly. However, both EF and EPSD can be
obtained from simulations using the Epos1.99 (version CRMC 1.5.3) [17, 18, 19] model. A
global factor ccent (listed in Table 2) was then calculated as the ratio of mean negatively charged
pion multiplicities obtained with the two selection procedures in the 5% most central events.

are shown of measured EPSD for minimum-bias selected (blue histograms) and T2 selected (red histograms)
events for 19A (left plot) and 150A GeV/c (right plot) beam momenta. Histograms are normalized to agree
in the overlap region (from the beginning of the distribution to the black dashed line). The T2 trigger was
set to accept ≈ 30% of the inelastic cross section. The accepted region corresponding to the 5% collisions
with the smallest EPSD is indicated by shading.

The resulting factors ccent range from 1.002 to 1.005 and correspond to only a small correction
compared to the systematic uncertainties of the measured particle multiplicities. A possible
dependence of the scaling factor on rapidity and transverse momentum was neglected. The
corrections (ccent) are negligibly small compared to the systematic uncertainties of the measured
particle multiplicities and are therefore not applied in the calculation of π− yields and neglected
in the quoted systematic uncertainties.

Finally, events generated with the Epos code with its implementation of the Wounded Nucleon
Model [19] were used to estimate the average number of wounded nucleons hW i for the 5% of
events with the smallest number of spectator nucleons and with the smallest value of EF. For
the latter selection the average impact parameter hbi was obtained as well. Results are listed in
Table 2. Example distributions of events in the W − EF plane for 19A and 150 A GeV/c beam
momenta are shown in Fig. 4. These distributions are quite broad and emphasize the importance
of proper simulation of the centrality selection when comparing model calculations with the
experimental results. For comparison hW i was also calculated from the GLISSANDO model
which uses a diﬀerent implementation of the Wounded Nucleon Model [24]. The resulting pion
multiplicities, also listed in Table 2, diﬀer by about 5%. This uncertainty is not shown in the
plots of the results.

3.2.1 Event selection

Central Ar+Sc events were selected using the following criteria:

(i) no oﬀtime beam particle detected within a time window of ±4 µs around the trigger particle,

(ii) beam particle trajectory measured in at least three planes out of four of BPD-1 and BPD-2

and in both planes of BPD-3,

(iii) a well reconstructed interaction vertex with z position (ﬁtted using the beam trajectory and
TPC tracks) not farther away than 10 cm from the center of the Sc target (see Fig. 5),

(iv) an upper cut on the energy EPSD in order to select the 5 % collisions with the lowest EPSD.

of incident beams as used for the target-inserted data. One ﬁnds that within the acceptance cut
region as indicated by vertical dashed lines in Fig. 5 the fraction of background events is smaller
than 2 · 10−3 and was therefore neglected.

The event statistics after applying the selection criteria are summarized in Table 1.

3.2.2 Track selection

In order to select tracks of primary charged hadrons and to reduce the contamination of tracks
from secondary interactions and weak decays, the following track selection criteria were applied:

(i) track momentum ﬁt at the interaction vertex should have converged,

(ii) ﬁtted x component of track momentum is negative. This selection minimizes the angle
between the track trajectory and the TPC pad direction for the chosen magnetic ﬁeld
direction, reducing uncertainties of the reconstructed cluster position, energy deposition
and track parameters,

(iii) total number of reconstructed points on the track should be greater than 30,

(iv) sum of the number of reconstructed points in VTPC-1 and VTPC-2 should be greater

than 15,

(v) the distance between the track extrapolated to the interaction plane and the interaction
point (impact parameter) should be smaller than 4 cm in the horizontal (bending) plane
and 2 cm in the vertical (drift) plane,

(vi) electron tracks were excluded by a cut on the particle energy loss dE/dx in the TPCs (see

Fig. 6).

The analysis was performed in (y, pT) and (y, mT − mπ) bins. The bin sizes were selected taking
into account the statistical uncertainties and the resolution of the momentum reconstruction [12].
Corrections as well as statistical and systematic uncertainties were calculated for each bin.

3.3 Corrections

Uncorrected yields of negatively charged hadrons per event after all event and track cuts n[h−]raw
divided by bin dimensions are shown in Fig. 7. In order to determine the mean multiplicity
of primary π− mesons produced in central Ar+Sc collisions a set of corrections was applied
to the extracted raw yields. The main biasing eﬀects are detector acceptance, loss of events
due to the cut on reconstructed vertex position, track selection cuts, reconstruction eﬃciency,
contributions of particles from weak decays (feed-down), and contribution of primary hadrons
other than negatively charged pions (mostly K− mesons). Contamination from events occurring
outside the target was negligible.

A simulation of the NA61/SHINE detector is used to correct the data for acceptance, reconstruction
eﬃciency, feed-down and contamination from re-interactions of produced particles. Only Ar+Sc

interactions in the target material were simulated and reconstructed. The Epos model [17, 18, 19]
was selected to generate the primary interactions. A Geant3 based program chain was used to
track particles through the spectrometer, generate decays and secondary interactions and simulate
the detector response (for more detail see Ref. [12]). Simulated events were then reconstructed
using the standard NA61/SHINE reconstruction chain and reconstructed tracks were matched to
the simulated particles based on the cluster positions. Hadrons which were not produced in the
primary interaction can amount to a signiﬁcant fraction of the selected track sample. Thus a
careful eﬀort was undertaken to evaluate and subtract this contribution.

Since Epos provides only an approximate description of the measurements of particle production
in Ar+Sc collisions, a data-based eﬀort was made to improve the estimate of contamination from
π− wrongly accepted as coming from the primary interaction. Yields of misidentiﬁed Kaons
were estimated from preliminary results of NA61/SHINE (see Ref. [25]) on K− production and
the contribution of π− from decays of hyperons was estimated from published results of other
experiments (see Ref. [26]). The relative eﬀect of such tuning of the yields of negatively charged
hadrons was below 5% for majority of the bins and did not exceed 7% for all the beam momenta.

Backward rapidity bins with relative statistical uncertainties exceeding 20% in case of the higher
beam momenta (150A and 75A GeV/c) and 30% in case of the lower beam momenta (40A, 30A,
19A and 13A GeV/c) were not used since they suﬀer from limited backward rapidity acceptance of
the detector.

The correction factor cypT, based on the event and detector simulation was calculated for each
y and pT bin as:

3.4 Statistical uncertainties

Statistical uncertainties of the yields receive contributions from the ﬁnite statistics of both the
data and the correction factors derived from the simulations. The contribution from the statistical
uncertainty of the data is much larger than that from the correction factors cypT which was
therefore neglected. The statistical uncertainty of the data was calculated assuming a Poisson
probability distribution for the number of entries in each y, pT bin.

3.5 Systematic uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties presented in this paper were calculated taking into account contributions
from the following eﬀects:

(i) Possible biases which were not corrected for. These are:

a) a possible bias due to the dE/dx cut applied to reject electron tracks,

b) a possible bias due to the removal of events with oﬀ-time beam particles close in time

to the trigger particle.

Their magnitude was estimated by varying the values of the corresponding cut. The values of
the selected dE/dx band around the Bethe-Bloch function was changed by ±0.01 dE/dx units
(where 1 corresponds to a minimum ionizing particle, and 0.04 is a typical width of the
dE/dx distribution for π−), and the rejection time window was changed to ±3 µs and
±5 µs. The systematic uncertainty was estimated as half of the maximum absolute diﬀerence
between h− multiplicities when varying the cut values.

(ii) Uncertainty of the correction for the track selection cuts used for data and Monte Carlo data
selection were estimated by removing the impact parameter cut and varying the minimum
number of required points by ±3. The observed changes suggest the potential bias is around
1%.

15

(iii) Uncertainty of the correction for contamination of the primary π− mesons by daughters
of decays and re-interactions. It was estimated from simulations using the Epos model
where the production rates of parents were adjusted to extrapolations of published data
(see Ref. [26]). The systematic uncertainty was estimated as 15% of the correction value.

(iv) Uncertainty of correction for the contamination of particles other than π− in negatively
charged hadrons h− spectrum. The value of the uncertainty was assumed as 15% of the
simulated contribution of K−, Σ− and p to the total number of negatively charged hadrons.

Values of σsys are listed in the table 4. The total systematic uncertainty was calculated by adding
in quadrature the individual contributions. Note that systematic biases in diﬀerent bins are
correlated, whereas statistical ﬂuctuations are independent.

Statistical and systematic uncertainties for all six beam momenta are shown as a function of
rapidity y in Fig. 8.

4 Experimental results

This section presents results on negatively charged pion spectra at 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A and
150A GeV/c beam momentum in the 5% most central 40Ar+45Sc collisions with statistical and
systematic uncertainties. The spectra refer to pions produced by strong interaction processes
and in electromagnetic decays of produced hadrons. Comparisons of the new measurements of
spectra, their parameters and mean multiplicities of π− mesons in central Ar+Sc collisions with
predictions of the Epos1.99 [17, 18, 19], Urqmd [27, 28] and Hijing [29] models are presented.
In the model calculations connected with spectra the selection of the 5% most central collisions
was based on the number of projectile spectator nucleons.

none of the models can describe the data well. For higher beam momenta Epos and Urqmd
describe data with reasonable accuracy.

was ﬁtted in the range 0.24 < mT − mπ < 0.72 GeV where no strong contributions from resonance
decays and radial ﬂow are expected. The ﬁtted parameters were the normalization A and the
inverse slope parameter T . The results of the ﬁts are indicated by lines in Fig. 11. The deviation
of the measurements from the exponential shape for larger values of mT − mπ is indicative of
collective transverse ﬂow [9] whereas the excess below the ﬁt range can be explained by the
contribution of resonance decay products to the π− spectrum.

reactions but about 15 MeV higher than for p+p and Be+Be reactions. Furthermore, Fig. 13
(right) shows that Epos model predictions for Ar+Sc collisions are lower than the NA61/SHINE
measurements and stay even below the measurements in inelastic p+p interactions. Predictions
of Urqmd exhibit a non-monotonic behavior. They lie lower than measurements at low beam
momenta and higher at high beam momenta. Hijing shows a concave behavior and unsatisfactory
agreement with measurements.

Figure 14 presents the inverse slope parameter T plotted versus the number of wounded nucleons
hW i which are a measure of the initial volume of the collision system. Although the uncertainties
are large, the measurements show a modest monotonic rise with increasing system size for all the
beam momenta.

As the distributions are not strictly exponential it may be better to characterize them by their
average values hmTi−mπ. These were calculated by summing the mT −mπ-weighted distributions
and adding an extrapolation for the region mT − mπ > 1.2 GeV based on the exponential ﬁts Eq. 4.
The results are plotted at mid-rapidity versus the collision energy in Fig. 15. The diﬀerences
between p+p and central Be+Be, Ar+Sc and central Pb+Pb reactions are compatible within
their uncertainties. Ar+Sc, Be+Be and p+p measurements show a rise with increasing collision
energy which is more pronounced for Ar+Sc. Due to the large uncertainties for the Pb+Pb data
a signiﬁcant discrimination between rise and constancy is not possible for this reaction. Epos and

Urqmd model predictions show a slope that is more similar to p+p interactions and less steep
than for Ar+Sc with Urqmd covering two highest collision energies. Hijing shows a concave
behavior with extreme points matching the measurements.

In order to compare the detailed features of the spectra, the ratios of the scaled diﬀerential
yields from p+p, Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb reactions to isospin symmetric Be+Be reference are plotted
in Fig. 16. From the three panels of the ﬁgure one may conclude that compared to inelastic
p+p collisions nucleus+nucleus interactions show a slightly concave behavior and a signiﬁcant
enhancement at small values of mT − mπ. One clearly observes a hardening of the spectra at high
values of mT − mπ and an increased peak at low mT − mπ for Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions, most
likely due to radial expansion ﬂow and decays of strongly decaying resonance states, respectively.

The NA61/SHINE experimental apparatus is characterized by large, but limited acceptance. In
order to compute the rapidity distribution dn/dy and mean multiplicity, one needs to extrapolate
the measured data to unmeasured regions.

First, the pT distributions in each rapidity bin were extrapolated from the edge of acceptance to
pT= 2 GeV/c, using the exponential form

The results are shown by the solid data points in Fig. 17 together with Epos, Urqmd and Hijing
model predictions. Figure 18 shows the results for all beam momenta combined into one plot.

In a second step the rapidity spectra are extrapolated to the missing rapidity acceptance. The
event trigger requires small energy emitted into the projectile spectator region but puts no
constraints on the target spectators. This together with the diﬀerent number of nucleons in the
Ar and Sc nucleus might cause some forward-backward asymmetry of the rapidity distribution.
Therefore, the sum of two symmetrically displaced Gaussians – related to projectile and target
contributions – was ﬁtted to the distributions:

where A0 and Arel are absolute and relative amplitudes, y0 is the displacement from center-of-mass
rapidity and σ0 is the common width. The ﬁtted two Gaussians are plotted as dashed colored
curves in Fig. 17. The ﬁgure shows that the asymmetry between the amplitudes of the two
Gaussians increases with decreasing beam momentum from 0.97 to 0.84 between 150A and
19A GeV/c beam momentum. This contrasts with the behavior observed for Be+Be collisions [14].
At 13A GeV/c there is no acceptance for y < 0 and the value 0.83 had to be determined from
extrapolation of results at higher energies. The resulting values of the ﬁtted parameters are
presented in Table 3. The r.m.s. widths of the rapidity distributions σdn/dy diﬀer by less than 5%
from the widths approximated by a single Gaussian function.

The total mean π− multiplicity was calculated using the formula:

parametrization of the rapidity distribution. In particular, widths and the positions of projectile
and target Gaussians were assumed to be independent, i.e. separate parameters y0,proj, y0,targ and
σ0,proj, σ0,targ were ﬁtted. The uncertainty of each ﬁtting parameter and the mean π− multiplicity
was calculated as a standard deviation from the value calculated for the standard values of all
parameters. The deﬁnition of σdn/dy was generalized to take into account that the width and the
shift of the projectile and target Gaussians can be diﬀerent and is given by the formula:

σdn/dy =

Experimental data on the width σdn/dy of the rapidity distributions of π− mesons produced in
central nucleus-nucleus collisions and inelastic nucleon-nucleon interactions as function of the
collision energy are presented in Fig. 19. Since the p+p collision system is not isospin symmetric
the isospin average (π− + π+)/2 was plotted for comparison. These results are referred to as
results for nucleon-nucleon (N +N ) collisions [30]. One observes that the width normalized to the
beam rapidity decreases slowly with increasing collision energy. When correcting the p+p data
for the isospin asymmetry one ﬁnds a monotonic decrease of σdn/dy with decreasing number of
nucleons in the colliding nuclei. One also observes that the measured values diﬀer little within
the SPS energy range. Epos, Urqmd and Hijing model predictions ﬁt into the measurements’
systematic uncertainties band. Figure 20 shows the width σdn/dy of the rapidity distributions
plotted versus the mean number of wounded nucleons hW i. The results seem to be independent
of hW i from N +N to Pb+Pb collisions for all studied collision energies.

The Ar+Sc system is approximately isospin symmetric. The hπ−i/hπ+i ratio calculated within

5 Relevance of the results to the onset of deconﬁnement

The speed of sound in the dense matter produced in the collisions was predicted to show a
minimum around the collision energy of the onset of deconﬁnement. This paper studies this
energy dependence for central Ar+Sc collisions.

The Landau hydrodynamical model of high energy collisions [31, 32] predicts rapidity distributions
of Gaussian shapes. In fact this prediction is approximately conﬁrmed by the experimental data,
see Ref. [33] and references therein. Moreover, the collision energy dependence of the width was
derived by Shuryak [34] from the same model under simplifying assumptions and reads:

σ2 =

where cs denotes the speed of sound, and c2
By inverting Eq. 10 one can express c2
s in the medium as a function of the measured width of the
rapidity distribution. The sound velocities extracted from the data on central Pb+Pb collisions,
in combination with results from AGS and RHIC on central Au+Au collisions, cover a wide

energy range. Here, the sound velocity exhibits a clear minimum [37, 38] (usually called the
softest point) at
sN N ≈ 10 GeV consistent with the reported onset of deconﬁnement [3, 4]. The
energy dependence of the sound velocities extracted from the new measurement are presented
in Fig. 23. The energy range covered by NA61/SHINE for results from central Ar+Sc, Be+Be
collisions and inelastic N +N reactions is too limited to allow a signiﬁcant conclusion about a
possible minimum.

Pions are the most copiously produced hadrons (≈ 90%) in collisions of nucleons and nuclei at SPS
energies. Their multiplicity is closely related to the entropy produced in such interactions [31, 39].
Since the number of degrees of freedom is higher for the quark-gluon plasma than for conﬁned
matter, it is expected that the entropy density of the produced ﬁnal state at given temperature
should also be higher in the ﬁrst case. Therefore, the entropy and information regarding the
state of matter formed in the early stage of a collision should be reﬂected in the number of
produced pions normalized to the volume of the system. This intuitive argument was quantiﬁed
in the Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [40]. The increase with collision energy of the
mean number of produced pions hπi, normalized to the number of wounded nucleons hW i [23] is
expected to be linear when plotted against the Fermi energy measure

sN N . Published results for inelastic nucleon-nucleon reactions and
central nucleus-nucleus collisions are compared.

The new NA61/SHINE results are presented in Fig.4. These, together with available measurements
from other experiments are presented in Fig. 242. The uncertainty connected with the calculation
of the number of wounded nucleons hW i was studied using diﬀerent MC models. This indicated a
variation of hπi/hW i of up to 6%. This source of uncertainty was not included in the systematic
uncertainties plotted in Fig. 24. The world data on N +N and central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions
established a well-known picture – the ”kink” plot. The results on N +N interactions increase
linearly with F , whereas the slope of the Pb+Pb results increase by about 30% in the low SPS
beam energy range (at ≈ 30A GeV). The suppression of pion yield in Pb+Pb collisions at low
collision energies was attributed to pion absorption in the evolving ﬁreball [41, 42]. The increase
of the ratio hπi/hW i can be related to activation of additional quark-gluon degrees of freedom.

The NA61/SHINE results on N +N interactions agree well with the world data. The results on
Be+Be collisions are mostly between measurements from N +N and Pb+Pb collisions. The new
data on Ar+Sc collisions seem to be systematically higher than the results for N +N , Be+Be
and Pb+Pb collisions at the lower energies. They are close to the Pb+Pb results at the highest

energy between light and heavy collision systems. This behavior suggests in the statistical scenario
a systematic increase of the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom.

Interestingly hπi/hW i for Ar+Sc reactions equals that for inelastic N +N reactions at low SPS
energies whereas it is closer to that for Pb+Pb reactions at high SPS energies. Moreover, a
suppression of the pion yield per wounded nucleon was observed in central Pb+Pb collisions
compared to inelastic N +N reactions at low energies which was attributed to pion absorption in
the evolving ﬁreball [41, 42]. This eﬀect is not found for the intermediate size Ar+Sc system in
which a smaller less dense ﬁreball is created.

6 Summary and outlook

Spectra and mean multiplicities of π− produced in the 5% most central Ar+Sc collisions were
measured by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS for beam momenta of 13A, 19A,
30A, 40A, 75A and 150A GeV/c using the h− method. The results represent the ﬁrst measurements
on pion production in an intermediate size collision system at SPS energies.

Energy and system size dependence of parameters of measured distributions – mean transverse
mass, the inverse slope parameter of transverse mass spectra, width of the rapidity distribution
and mean multiplicity – were presented and discussed.

The inverse slope parameter of the transverse mass distribution increases with increasing system
size and collision energy. Width of the rapidity distribution is independent of the system size
and increases with collision energy. The mean multiplicity at high energies increases faster with
the system size than expected from the Wounded Nucleon Model. The rate of the increase with
collision energy is faster in Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions than in N +N interactions. The new
measurements were compared to predictions of Epos1.99 [17, 18, 19], Urqmd1.3.1 [27, 28] and
Hijing [29] models. None of them provides a consistent description of the new NA61/SHINE
measurements in Ar+Sc collisions.

The new results on central Ar+Sc collisions were discussed in the context of the signatures of the
onset of deconﬁnement. The velocity of sound extracted form the width of rapidity distribution
is consistent with results for central Pb+Pb collisions as well as Be+Be and N+N interactions.
Measurements in a broader energy range are needed to conclude on a possible minimum of the
sound velocity in Ar+Sc collisions. The ratio of mean pion multiplicity to the number of wounded
nucleons and its collision energy dependence at the highest SPS energies are close to the ones
for central Pb+Pb collisions and higher than the corresponding results for N+N and Be+Be
interactions. This behavior suggests an increase of the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom
already in central Ar+Sc collisions at the top SPS energies.
