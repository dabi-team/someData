Abstract: We revisit the a conﬁned (in a Cornell-type Lorentz scalar potential) KG-oscillator in

Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation background. We show that the eﬀect of space-like

dislocation is to shift the energy levels along the dislocation parameter axis, and consequently energy

levels crossings are unavoidable. We report some KG-particles in a pseudo-Minkowski spacetime

with space-like dislocation that admit isospectrality and invariance with the conﬁned KG-oscillator

in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation. An alternative PDM setting for the KG-particles

(relativistic particles in general) is introduced. We discuss the eﬀects of space-like dislocation and

PDM settings on the conﬁned KG-oscillators in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation.

Three conﬁned PDM KG-oscillators are discussed as illustrative examples, (i) a PDM KG-oscillator
from a dimensionless scalar multiplier g (r) = exp(2αr2
) ≥ 0, α ≥ 0, (ii) a PDM KG-oscillator from
a power law type dimensionless scalar multiplier g (r) = Arσ ≥ 0, and (iii) a PDM KG-oscillator in
a Cornnell-type conﬁnement with a dimensionless scalar multiplier g (r) = exp (ξr) ≥ 0 .

INTRODUCTION

The grand uniﬁed theories have predicted possible topological defects in spacetime [1–4] that have been investigated

in many areas of physics. For example, in condensed matter physics [5], in gravitation [6–8] (where the linear defects

are due dislocation (torsion) and curvature (disclinations)), in domain wall [2, 3], in cosmic string [9, 10], in global

monopole [11], etc. However, in their work on Volterra distortions and cosmic defects, Puntigam and Soleng [6] have

generalized the Volterra distortion to (3+1)-dimensions, using diﬀerential geometric and gauge theoretical methods,

and introduced the concept of Volterra distorted spacetime. Where, distortions are line-like defects characterized by

a delta-function-valued curvature (classiﬁed as disclination) and torsion (classiﬁed as dislocation) distributions that

result in rotational and translational holonomy. Dislocation may be in the form of a spiral-type [7] or a screw-type

[8, 12]. The latter is in point of the current study.

Such topological defects in spacetime have their ﬁgure prints on the spectroscopic structure of relativistic and non-

relativistic quantum systems. The Dirac oscillator [13], for example, is investigated by Hassanabadi and co-worker

[14, 15] in a G¨odel-type cosmic string Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime. The Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillator is studied in

the G¨odel-type spacetime (e.g., [12, 16–21]), in cosmic string spacetime and Kaluza-Klein theory (e.g., [12, 22–26]),

in Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime [27], in the (2+1)-dimensional G¨urses spacetime (e.g., [28–32]).

On the other hand, the concept of position-dependent eﬀective mass (PDM) (initiated by Mathews-Lakshmanan os-

cillator [33]) has sparked research interest on PDM in both classical and quantum mechanics [33–55]. Such a PDM con-

cept is, in fact, a metaphoric manifestation of coordinate transformation [37–39, 43]. The coordinate transformation,

in eﬀect, changes the form of the canonical momentum in classical and the momentum operator in quantum mechanics

(e.g., [37, 38, 41, 46] and related references therein). In classical mechanics, for example, negative the gradient of the

potential force ﬁeld is no longer the time derivative of the canonical momentum p = m (x) ˙x; m(x) = m g(x), but it

is rather related to the time derivative of the pseudo-momentum (also called Noether momentum) π (x) =

m g (x) ˙x

[38], where m denotes the rest mass of the classical/quantum mechanical particle at hand and g(x) is a dimensionless

p

positive valued scalar multiplier. Expressing the canonical momentum as p = m (x) ˙x with m(x) = m g(x) inevitably

suggests the metaphor notion of PDM particles. In quantum mechanics, moreover, the PDM (metaphorically speak-

ing) momentum operator is constructed by Mustafa and Algadhi [41] to read

Which, in its most simplistic one-dimensional form, suggests (e.g., [37, 40] for more details) that the von Roos [34]
PDM kinetic energy operator, in ~ = 1 units,

ˆT (x) Φ(x) =

Φ(x) =

−

(2)

which is known in the literature as Mustafa and Mazharimousavi’s ordering of the ambiguity parameters involved in

p

the von Roos [34] PDM kinetic energy operator [40]. This result clearly indicates that the momentum operator of an

eﬀective and metaphoric PDM quantum particle is given by (1). It has also been reported that such PDM quantum

particles (as so should be metaphorically called hereinafter) may very well be trapped in their own byproducted force

ﬁelds (i.e., quasi-free PDM particles is used to describe such a system [42]). Yet, it has been used to ﬁnd the PDM

creation and annihilation operators for the PDM-Schr¨odinger oscillator [37].

Nevertheless, attempts were made to include PDM settings in the Dirac and KG relativistic equations through the

assumption that m

−→

m + S (r) = m(r), where m denotes the rest mass energy, S (r) is the Lorentz scalar potential

(commonly used in heavy quarkonium spectroscopy [57]), and m(r) denotes PDM (e.g., [56, 58, 59]). In the current

study, however, we shall not use this assumption but rather argue that analogous to textbook procedure, where the

momentum operator pj =

−

i∂j for constant mass is used in the relativistic wave equations, so should be the case with

the PDM-momentum operator (1) to describe PDM-relativistic quantum particles (e.g., [37, 41, 42, 46]). That is, for

PDM particles (relativistic and non-relativistic), the PDM-momentum operator (1) should replace the constant mass

textbook momentum operator pj =

−

i∂j. In the current methodical proposal, we use such a PDM assumption and

investigate the eﬀects of the gravitational ﬁeld generated by Minkowski spacetime with space-like screw dislocation

((3) below) on some conﬁned PDM KG-oscillators.

 
 
The organization of this paper is in order. We revisit, in section 2, with a conﬁned (in a Cornnell-type potential

[57, 60]) KG-oscillator in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation background. We show that the eﬀect

of space-like dislocation is to shift the energy levels along the dislocation parameter axis, and consequently energy

levels crossings (i.e., occasional degeneracies) are unavoidable. Energy levels crossings, nevertheless, is a phenomenon

responsible for electron transfer in protein, it underlies stability analysis in mechanical engineering, and appears in

algebraic geometry (e.g., [61] and references cited therein). Moreover, clusterings of energy levels are found feasible for

in section 3, some KG-particles in a transformed pseudo-Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation (20), below,

that admit isospectrality and invariance with the KG-oscillator in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation

(3), below. Moreover, we suggest (in section 4) an alternative PDM setting for the KG-particles (relativistic particles

in general). Therein, we use the PDM-momentum operator (1), constructed by Mustafa and Algadhi [41], and discuss

the eﬀects of space-like dislocation and PDM settings on the conﬁned KG-oscillators in Minkowski spacetime with

space-like dislocation. Three conﬁned PDM KG-oscillators are used/discussed as illustrative examples, (i) a PDM

II. CONFINED KG-OSCILLATOR IN MINKOWSKI SPACETIME WITH SPACE-LIKE SCREW

DISLOCATION: REVISITED

In this section, we consider Minkowski spacetime with space-like screw dislocation (i.e., a Volterra-type spacetime

with space-like dislocation [6, 8, 62, 63] (in ~ = c = 1 units) described by the line element

where δ denotes space-like dislocation parameter (i.e., torsion parameter). The covariant and contravariant metric

0 (with m denoting rest mass of the KG-particle) to recover the traditionally used

values as in (e.g., [12] and other related references cited therein). However, we shall use a more general parameter

η

0 . In this case, we avoid eminent confusion and inconsistency between m2 (denoting m2c2 = mmc2, the rest

mass multiplied by the rest mass energy, should the KG-equation (7) be divided by c2) on the R.H.S. and the rest

mass of the particle on the L.H.S. of the KG-equation (7) for η = mω case. This point is made implicitly clear by

Moshinsky and Szczepaniak [13] and Mirza and Mohadesi [64] while dealing with the Dirac and KG oscillators, who

kept the speed of light c as is. We therefore stick with our assumption and use the spacetime metric tensor elements

in (4), to recast (7) as

The choice of γ = 2 (2nr + 1) + α is not a random one but rather manifested by the fact that when a = b = 0

the energies in (12) should naturally be recovered (this issue is emphasised in e.g., [32, 65, 66]). However, in their

comment on Vit´oria et al.’s [69] biconﬂuent Heun solution/polynomial, Neto et al. [66] have followed [65] and detailed

the correct approach, which is very much in agreement with our treatment given in the Appendix below. This would

also suggest that the result (33) of Vit´oria and Bakke [70] is valid for n

0 and not for n

≥

≥

1 (in this case they

have lost all states with the quantum number nr = 0). The reader is advised to see also the detailed discussion on

this quantum system and the use of an+1 = 0 condition that correlates a with b, but at the same time introduces

physically/mathematically unacceptable results, in the Appendix below.

FIG. 2: We plot the energy levels of (19) versus the torsion parameter δ, without the Cornell conﬁnement, for m = kz = η = 1,

a = b = 0 and for (a) ℓ = 0, nr = 0, 1, 2, 3, (b) ℓ = 10, nr = 0, 1, 2, 3, and (c) ℓ = −10, nr = 0, 1, 2, 3.

At this point, one should be aware that this result (19), along with that in (17), belong to the set of the so called

conditionally exactly solvable quantum mechanical problems. Moreover, it is obvious that for the case when ˜ω = 0 = a,

the biconﬂuent Heun polynomial energies in (19) tragically fails to provide any information on the spectrum and/or the

radial wave functions of a KG-Coulombic problem. Yet, instead of collapsing into the spectrum of the KG-Coulombic

problem, the reported spectrum (19) collapses into the free relativistic particle energies E2 = m2 + k2

z . Nevertheless,

we continue with such conditionally exact solution (17) and (19) and do our analysis.

In Figures 1 and 2, we show the eﬀect of dislocation related parameter δ on the energy levels of a conﬁned KG-

oscillator in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation. We clearly observe that the ﬁrst term under the square

root of (19) determines the shifts in the energy levels at δ = ℓ/kz, on the δ-axis. That is, for negative ℓ values

the shifts will be in the negative δ region, whereas for positive ℓ values the shifts will be in the positive δ region.

This would, in eﬀect, manifestly yield energy levels crossings (i.e., occasional degeneracies, as shown in ﬁgures 1(a),

1(b), and 1(c), with the Cornell conﬁnement). Moreover, in Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), we observe eminent energy

levels clusterings when

δ

|

|

>> 1, for each value of the magnetic quantum number ℓ = 0, 1, 2,

. These eﬀects of

· · ·

the dislocation parameter on the energy levels of the conﬁned KG-oscillator in Minkowski spacetime with space-like

dislocation are clear, therefore.

III. KG-PARTICLES IN A PSEUDO-MINKOWSKI SPACETIME WITH SPACE-LIKE DISLOCATION

ADMITTING ISOSPECTRALITY AND INVARIANCE WITH THE KG-OSCILLATORS OF (3)

where

d˜r =

This would govern the correlation between the positive-valued scalar multipliers g (r) and Q (r). In this case, our

transformed metric (20) reads

d˜s2 =

−

dt2 + g(r) dr2 + Q(r) r2 dϕ2 + (dz + δdϕ)2 .

(23)

In this section, we shall show that all KG-particles in such pseudo-Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation

(23) exactly inherit the quantum mechanical properties of the conﬁned KG-oscillator in the Minkowski spacetime with

space-like screw dislocation discussed in section 2 above. At this point, one should notice that our positive-valued

scalar multiplier g(r) should never converge to zero as r

, otherwise it would yield a catastrophic collapse of

→ ∞

the radial coordinate (any related coordinate in general) and consequently a catastrophic collapse of the quantum

mechanical system at hand.

In the classical mechanical language, ˜r =

Q(r)r

˙˜r = d˜r/dt =

g(r) ˙r suggests

⇒

that Q(r) > 0 and g(r) > 0 so that the 0

in (see e.g., [39] and related references cited therein). Then the covariant and contravariant metric tensors (with

This equation is in the same form as that in (15) and they are, therefore, isospectral and invariant. Hence, (30)

inherits the energies reported in (19) and the radial eigenfunctions in (17) but with ˜r replacing r. That is, in terms

As long as g(r) and Q(r) (of f (r) = ˜r2 = Q(r)r2) are correlated through (22) and they are positive valued functions,

then all KG-particles in the transformed pseudo-Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation metric (23) have

identical energy spectra as the spectrum of the KG-oscillators in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation

metric (3), conﬁned S(r)

= 0 or unconﬁned S(r) = 0, discussed in section 2 above.

IV. PDM KG-OSCILLATORS IN MINKOWSKI SPACETIME WITH SPACE-LIKE DISLOCATION

AND CONFINED/UNCONFINED KG-OSCILLATORS

We have mentioned that Mustafa and Algadhi [41] have shown that an eﬀective PDM-momentum operator is given

by (1). In this section, we shall use such PDM-momentum operator to describe metaphorically PDM KG-particles in

a spacetime with a space-like dislocation (3) and subject them to a Lorentz scalar potential S(r). The corresponding

inverse metric tensor gµν is readily given in (4). Moreover, we shall use the assumption that m (r) = m (r) = m g(r)

(i.e., only radially dependent). Under such settings, the momentum operator in (6) would take the PDM form so that

Obviously, for constant mass settings the dimensionless scalar multiplier is set equal 1, i.e., g (r) = 1, and equation

(35) collapses into that of (10) as should be. Yet, one should notice that when the KG-oscillator’s eﬀective frequency

is oﬀ, i.e., η = 0, equation (35) would describe KG-particles in Minkowski spacetime with a space-like dislocation, in

general. To study the space-like dislocation eﬀect on such PDM KG-particles, we choose three illustrative examples.

The energy levels are shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3(a), we show the energy levels against the PDM parameter ξ > 0

the other hand, the space-like dislocation parameter’s eﬀect on the energy levels, for some ﬁxed values of ξ, maintains

the same trend of behavior as that associated with (19) and discussed in section 2.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work, we have studied the KG-oscillator in Minkowski spacetime with a space-like dislocation. We have

started with KG-oscillators conﬁned in a Cornell-type Lorentz scalar potential and discussed the dislocation eﬀect

 
on their conditionally exact energy levels. We observed that the space-like dislocation shifts the energy levels along

the dislocation parameter δ-axis by δ = ℓ/kz; ℓ = 0,

· · ·

(documented in Figures 1(b), 1(c), 2(b), 2(c), 3(b),

and 3(c)). That is, for ℓ =

|
values the shifts are in the direction of positive δ region. This in turn manifestly resulted in energy levels crossings

−|

|

|

values, the shifts are in the direction of negative δ- region, whereas for ℓ = +

(as shown in ﬁgures 1(b), 1(c), and 3(b)). Moreover, in Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), we have observed eminent

energy levels clusterings when

. We have

reported, in section 3, a set of KG-particles in a pseudo-Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation admitting

isospectrality and invariance with the conﬁned KG-oscillators in Minkowski spacetime with a space-like dislocation.

Such KG-particles are found to inherit the same eﬀects discussed above.

We have used, in section 4, the argument that the momentum operator for PDM-particles (metaphorically speaking)

is given by (1) [41] and yields a von Roos [34] kinetic energy operator (2) with the so called MM-ordering (e.g., Mustafa

and Mazharimousavi’s ordering [37, 40]). Such PDM-particles are studied in the context of KG-equation in Minkowski

spacetime with a space-like dislocation background. Hence, the metaphoric notion PDM KG-particles is adopted in the

process. The eﬀect of space-like dislocation on energy levels of such KG-particles is reported through three illustrative

examples, (i) a PDM KG-oscillator from a dimensionless scalar multiplier g (r) = exp(2αr2)

KG-oscillator from a power law type dimensionless scalar multiplier g (r) = Arσ

≥
a Cornnell-type conﬁnement with a dimensionless scalar multiplier g (r) = exp (ξr)

0, α

≥

≥

0, (ii) a PDM

0, and (iii) a PDM KG-oscillator in

0 . For the PDM KG-oscillators

≥

of (i) and (ii), the energy levels are shown to have similar trends of behavior as those of (19) discussed in section 2.

Whereas, for the PDM KG-oscillator in (iii), we found that such PDM setting introduces a Cornell-like conﬁnement

as its own byproduct. Hereby, obvious clustering of the energy levels are observed, as the PDM parameter ξ grows

up, but no energy levels crossing are found feasible for a ﬁxed space-like dislocation parameter δ value (documented

in ﬁgure 3(a)). Moreover, the eﬀect of the space-like dislocation parameter δ on the energy levels, for a ﬁxed PDM

parameter ξ, is found to maintain the same trend of behavior as that associated with (19) and discussed in section 2.

Finally, the current methodical proposal may very well be extended to cover a more general case of PDM KG-

particles and PDM Dirac-particles in diﬀerent spacetime backgrounds with topological defects. In our opinion, the

metaphoric PDM concept for relativistic particles should follow the procedure described in the current methodical

proposal, and not through the assumption that m

−→

m + S (r) = m(r) (as in, e.g., [56, 58, 59]). To the best of our

knowledge, such a PDM KG-oscillator in Minkowski spacetime with space-like dislocation methodical proposal has

never been reported elsewhere.

we demand that an+1 = 0 for

and so on. This means that for every n value we have a diﬀerent correlation between A = A(n, B) and B = B(n, A)

(which are in exact accord with those reported in (9) of Fern´andez [72]). Under such sever restrictions on the

parameters of the Cornell-type potential, one would recast the energy levels of (68) as

to represent the eigenvalues of (15). At this point, one should notice that the condition of truncation of the biconﬂuent
Heun series into a biconﬂuent Heun polynomial of degree n = 2nr ≥
has been discussed in [26, 32, 65, 66, 68, 71–73]. Obviously, moreover, this result shows that the biconﬂuent Heun

0 is not violated. This is not a new practice. It

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

polynomial solution discussed above is one of the so called conditionally exact solutions and not ”the exact solution”

for (60). In this case, we rewrite our biconﬂuent Heun polynomial of degree n = 2 nr as

H(r) =

(78)

This polynomial is, in fact, responsible for the nodes in the corresponding radial wave function ψ(r).

In this appendix section, we have followed, more or less, the usual procedure followed by many authors (e.g., [65–73]

and references cited therein). In fact, we have very closely followed Fern´andez [72, 73] to work out the above results.

Fern´andez [72, 73] has very carefully and righteously detailed the most misunderstood conditionally-exact solvability

of the model above, related to the three terms recursion relation (71). The result reported in (77) have derived

some authors to conclude/claim that there exist some quantization recipe for the parameter A = A(n, B) (hence,

B = B(n, B)) mandated by the condition an+1 = a2nr +1 = 0 in (73). However, if we put this above procedure to the

test, we may then pin point the problem associated with such assumptions.

Let us consider that B = 0 and

Next, we wish now to compare this result with the same Schr¨odinger oscillator model reported by Medeirosa and de

Mello [68] (section 4.3), with the correct mapping between the parameters used (i.e., ˜γm =
˜γours, ω = eB◦/2M = 0ours, δL√∆ =

=
Aours, ǫk,m = ˜λours, 0 = ηours, k = (kz)ours and ∆ = ˜ωours). The comparison
between our result in (82) and their result in (49) of [68] (of course, with the missed terms in their (36), (38), (59), (61),

ours,

i.e., k2

L/4∆ in (49) and (51)) indicates that the results are in exact agreement
with each other and the truncation order n should be correlated with the radial quantum number nr through the

k2 + M 2

→

→

−

relation n = 2nr. Moreover, the result in (82) suggests that there is no quantization characterization associated with

the parameter A or ˜ω, they are both (n = 2 nr)-independent parameters. This is a brute-force evidence that should

be taken into account while dealing with this problem.

A ﬁnal note on the procedures discussed above is critically unavoidable. For A = 0 = B, the recursion relation

(74) is safely satisﬁed but not that of (75). The relation of (75) implies that γ′ = 0 =

⇒ |

1/2 which is neither

physically nor mathematically acceptable (similar consequence appear in (9) of Fern´andez [72] where the angular

momentum quantum number ℓ takes the value ℓ =

−

1 as a = b = 0 in his relation (4)). Yet in the results reported by

Medeirosa and de Mello [68] (section 4.3), we notice that things are more tragic in the sense that if one sets ηL = 0

in their (40), then their ˜ω1,m of their (52) takes the value ˜ω1,m = 0. As a result, their reported energy spectrum
√k2 + M 2 (although they still have the harmonic oscillator term

collapses into that of free particle energy Ek,m,n =

±

but their solution tragically fails for such parametric settings). This is also reﬂected on their general solution (their

section 4.4). The same happens with the results reported by Ver¸cin [74] in equation (22). This should lead us to one

conclusion. The above mentioned methodical procedure is insecure/unsafe and its results are unreliable. One has,

therefore, to resort to a more reliable methodical proposal like the one very recently discussed in [75].
