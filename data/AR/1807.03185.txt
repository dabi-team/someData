On strangeness in NA61/SHINE ∗

Maciej P. Lewicki
for the NA61/SHINE Collaboration

Institute of Theoretical Physics, Univeristy of Wroclaw

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN Super-Proton-
Synchrotron. The main goals of the experiment are to discover the critical
point of strongly interacting matter and to study the properties of the
onset of deconﬁnement. In order to reach these goals, a study of hadron
production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and
proton-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and size of the
colliding nuclei. In this paper, I will review recent results on strangeness
production in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions in the SPS energy range.
Kinematic spectra and mean multiplicities of kaons obtained with various
analysis methods will be shown. An overview of strangeness production
and its dependence on system size in the vicinity of the phase transition
will be presented as well.

1. Study of strong interactions in NA61/SHINE

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target spectrometer [1] located in CERN’s North
Area, utilizing the SPS proton, ion and hadron beams. Tracking capabili-
ties are provided by four large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPC),
two of which are located in magnetic ﬁelds. The Projectile Spectator De-
tector (PSD), a zero degree, modular calorimeter, is used to determine the
centrality of the collisions.

The aim of the experiment is to explore the QCD phase diagram (µB, T )
by a two-dimensional scan in collision energy and system size. The yields
of hadrons produced in the collisions are studied for indications of the onset
of deconﬁnement and the critical point of the phase transition. This paper
discusses the properties of strangeness production in the vicinity of the de-
conﬁnement phase transition. Special attention is given to recent results on
Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions, which provide new insight into the system size
dependence of hadron production near the onset of deconﬁnement.

2. Strangeness production near deconﬁnement phase transition

There is no net strangeness content in the colliding nuclei, so any (anti-
)strange particles recorded in the detectors are produced by strong inter-
actions during the collision. Therefore (anti-)strange particles serve as an
excellent probe of the phase transition dynamics.

In the hadronic phase the lightest strangeness carriers are K mesons, the
mass (MK
500 MeV) of which largely exceeds the critical temperature of
hadron matter, estimated at around 160 MeV. In the QGP phase the role
of lightest strangeness carriers is ceded to relatively light strange and anti-
strange quarks (ms

100MeV).

In the statistical approach (as in [2]) we may predict the dependence
of strangeness production on collision energy by invoking the Boltzmann
approximation as an intuitive toy model:

In the conﬁned phase the total entropy s produced is proportional to T 3.
Production of light strange (and antistrange) particles however (with mh

and quickly increases with the collision energy. In the QGP phase, due to
the lower mass of strange quarks (ms < T ), the strangeness yield becomes
T 3) and the strangeness
approximately proportional to the entropy (both
to entropy production ratio becomes constant with energy.

∝

Therefore we expect a "jump" in the energy dependence from the quickly
increasing strangeness yield for conﬁned matter to the equilibrium value ex-
pected for deconﬁned matter. The non-monotonic energy dependence of
the strangeness to entropy production ratio followed by a plateau at higher
energies is expected as a direct consequence of the onset of deconﬁnement.
Exact calculations within the SMES model [2] show higher values of the dis-
cussed ratio in the hadronic medium at the onset of deconﬁnement resulting
in a very speciﬁc shape of the energy dependence, called the “horn”. (see:
Pb+Pb data-points in ﬁg. 2).

3. Results on strangeness production

Particle production changes rapidly with collision energy in the vicinity
of the onset of deconﬁnement. One observes a clear, qualitative diﬀerence
between results obtained in p+p collisions [3] and collisions of heavy nuclei
(Pb+Pb or Au+Au) [4, 5, 6]. This diﬀerence is especially pronounced in
the production of strange hadrons as exempliﬁed by the “horn plot” shown
in Fig. 2.

The NA61/SHINE experiment extends the set of experimental results on
hadron production near the onset of deconﬁnement by unique measurements
of collisions of intermediate size nuclei: Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Xe+La. The
preliminary results released by the collaboration include spectra and multi-
plicities of identiﬁed hadrons in Be+Be [7, 8] and Ar+Sc [9, 10] interactions.
Additionally, reference measurements of p+p collisions were obtained and
are shown as well [11].

The transverse mass spectra of kaons recorded in Be+Be collisions were
ﬁtted with exponential function to extract the inverse slope parameter (at
mid-rapidity). Be+Be measurements (green diamonds in ﬁg. 1) fall very
close to the inverse slope parameter obtained for p+p interactions. Inter-
estingly, a step structure is found like in Pb+Pb collisions, although at a
lower level. The measured results for the
ratio at mid-rapidity
(Fig. 2, right panel) in Be+Be and p+p collisions are also very similar –
Be+Be data points are only slightly higher.

diﬀerent levels. Recent preliminary measurements of Be+Be fall very close to the

Pb+Pb towards higher collision energies. It is worth noting, that other mea-
surements of hadron production properties: multiplicity ﬂuctuations [12],
pion production [9] and spectra shapes [13, 10] show further similarities of
Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb systems.

Fig. 2: Measurements of K/π ratios (at mid-rapidity and in 4π acceptance) as a
probe of system size dependence of strangeness production. Preliminary results on
Ar+Sc lie between light and heavy systems. Data on Be+Be is very close to p+p.

4. System size dependence

From the results described in the previous section one can deduce a
clear global trend in data on intermediate size systems. Particle produc-
tion properties recorded for Be+Be collisions show a close similarity to p+p
interactions, while collisions of Ar+Sc are much closer to data on Pb+Pb.
Such behavior cannot be reproduced so far by any of the models of heavy-
ion collisions. Both, statistical and dynamical approaches, fail to describe
the new preliminary data provided by NA61/SHINE.

The system size dependence predicted by SMES is governed by the di-
minishing eﬀect of the canonical strangeness suppression with increasing
volume within statistical models. According to SMES, in case of the Be+Be
system, the eﬀect of canonical suppression should already be very small.
The contrary is visible in the data – the results from the Be+Be system are
within the statistical errors near the expectations of the wounded nucleon
model, which treats each binary nucleon-nucleon collision independently (see
Fig. 3 for comparison).

The parton-hadron-string-dynamics model (PHSD) [14] is based on a
dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice QCD
results in thermodynamical equilibrium. The recent update of the model
includes a chiral phase transition – a decreasing mass of strange degrees of
freedom already in the conﬁned phase. Only with this update the model is

the PHSD predicts an increase of said ratio with decreasing system size for
9 GeV. This is in conﬂict with the
collision energies larger than √sN N

5. Conclusions

The new set of preliminary results from the NA61/SHINE Collaboration
on hadron production in collisions of intermediate size nuclei (Be+Be and
Ar+Sc) provides a fresh look into the properties of matter in the vicinity
of the onset of deconﬁnement. The key observation is the clear qualitative
diﬀerence between the results on small nuclei collisions (p+p, Be+Be) and
those of larger sizes (Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb). In particular, the measurements of

Similar (and even more pronounced) trends are observed in other
Na61/Shine measurements, namely: multiplicity ﬂuctuations and π− spec-
tra. This leads to the question whether there might be a microscopic phe-
nomenon leading to such a clear distinction between lighter (p+p, Be+Be)
and heavier (Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb) systems. One may hypothesize that in the
ﬁrst case we seem to observe reactions of independent binary N+N colli-
sions, while in the latter the system evolves collectively as a whole. Figure 5
shows a schematic picture of the two onsets present in heavy-ion collisions:
the onset of deconﬁnement and the the onset of ﬁreball. We can distinguish
four hypothetical domains in which hadron production properties should
diﬀer signiﬁcantly.

More experimental data and more numerical tests are needed to deter-
mine the precise mechanisms behind the apparent thresholds present in the
system size dependence of particle production. No theoretical models can
as yet reproduce the experimental results, which clearly puts a challenge on
the market, especially considering more data on intermediate size systems
coming from the NA61/SHINE Collaboration in the near future.
