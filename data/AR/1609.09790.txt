Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy measurements of magnetic bubble domains 
demonstrate that Ar+ irradiation around 100 eV can tune the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) 
in Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. Varying the irradiation energy and dose changes the DMI sign and magnitude 
separately from the magnetic anisotropy, allowing tuning of the DMI while holding the coercive field 
constant. This simultaneous control emphasizes the different physical origins of these effects. To 
accurately measure the DMI, we propose and apply a physical model for a poorly understood peak in 
domain wall velocity at zero in-plane field. The ability to tune the DMI with the spatial resolution of 
the Ar+ irradiation enables new fundamental investigations and technological applications of chiral 
nanomagnetics. 

The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is a chiral energy term leading to interesting nanoscale 
magnetic phenomena [1-4]. Examples include skyrmions [5-10], domain wall motion [11-15], helical spin 
textures [16,17], and spin-orbit torque magnetization switching [18-20]. However, such phenomena 
depend on a combination of the DMI and non-chiral magnetic effects such as anisotropy [21-23], 
Zeeman energy [4,24,25] and dipolar interaction [26-28]. While previous studies have demonstrated 
several methods for controlling the DMI [29-32], these also lead to variations in magnetic anisotropy 
and exchange interaction, making it difficult to reach a specific location in the phase space of 
micromagnetic energy parameters. Furthermore, these methods cannot be applied to different regions 
of the same sample, requiring separate samples to vary the DMI. Addressing these limitations, we 
demonstrate post-growth Ar+ irradiation around 100 eV as a method to tune the sign and magnitude of 
the DMI, separately from the coercive field 0Hc, in a single trilayer of Pt/Co/Pt, a model nanomagnetic 
system with perpendicular interfacial anisotropy.  

First, we report the sample growth and Ar+ irradiation procedures that we use to tune the properties 
of the trilayer. Then, we describe the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy technique that we 
use to measure domain wall motion and infer the effective DMI field 0HDMI in the trilayer. Some of our 
data sets show a previously observed but unexplained peak in domain wall velocity at zero in-plane field, 
for which we propose a physical model. We fit our data with this model and demonstrate that we can 
simultaneously control 0HDMI and 0HC by varying the energy and dose of Ar+ irradiation, enabling us to 
implement arbitrary combinations of these magnetic parameters. Last, we attribute the separate tuning 
of 0HDMI and 0HC [33-36] to the distinct effects of etching the top Pt layer and modifying the disorder 
of the Co/Pt interfaces by Ar+ irradiation. 

We study a single trilayer of Pt(35 nm)/Co(0.8 nm)/Pt(1.7 nm) that we sputter on a p-type silicon 

wafer (Supplemental Material S1). We use a shadow mask to irradiate the trilayer with a spatially 
varying dose of Ar+ at a range of energies EAr+ from 50 eV to 140 eV in increments of 5 eV, and then 
remove the sample from vacuum for measurement in air. The irradiation reduces the as-grown value of 
0HC ≈ 80 mT to values ranging to 0 mT where spontaneous domain fluctuations [37] and a spin 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
reorientation transition [35] occur. For this trilayer and these energies, the spin reorientation transition 
occurs with Ar+ doses of approximately 2 × 1015 cm-2 to 2 × 1016 cm-2. 

We measure the DMI of different regions of this trilayer using MOKE microscopy of the expansion of 

magnetic bubble domains with applied out-of-plane and in-plane fields Bz and By. In this technique, Bz 
creates and expands bubbles while the DMI and By lead to asymmetry of this expansion (Fig. 1(a)) by 
modifying the energy of the Néel walls surrounding the bubbles [29,38,39]. For example, the left side of 
the left bubble in Fig. 1(a) expands faster in the direction of By because this Néel wall has a lower energy 
due to By, corresponding to 0HDMI > 0 mT. Building on the earlier reports, we pulse Bz to generate and 
annihilate magnetic bubbles at a repetition frequency of 50 Hz to 150 Hz, which is higher than the 
imaging frequency of 10 Hz. Therefore, each MOKE micrograph (Fig. 1, (b,c)) shows a bubble at its 
maximum size, from the average of 5 to 15 expansions. While applying pulses of Bz, we apply By as a 
triangle wave with a frequency of 50 mHz, which is much slower than the Bz repetition frequency. 
Therefore, the bubbles that we measure accurately reflect how By affects their expansion. Supplemental 
Material S2 presents details of the field excitation technique. To measure domain wall displacements in 
real time, we take a cross-sectional strip of each bubble (Fig. 1(b,c), blue and red rectangles), average 
these strips across the x direction, (Fig. 1(d,e), blue and red markers), and fit each resulting profile to 
arctangent functions (Fig. 1(d,e), black lines) which empirically model the optically broadened profile of 
the domain walls (Supplemental Material S3) and superresolve their positions in real time. We divide the 
domain wall displacements by the duration of the Bz pulses to obtain the mean velocity v of each 
domain wall during bubble expansion. 

Fig. 1: Ar+ irradiation of a Pt/Co/Pt trilayer controls the sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction 
(DMI). (a) A simplified schematic shows magnetic bubble domains with positive Mz (light gray circles) in 
trilayer regions irradiated with 50 eV Ar+ or 100 eV Ar+, expanding asymmetrically (white arrows) in 
opposite y directions from nucleation sites (black dots) in response to applied fields Bz and By. The 
direction of this asymmetric expansion indicates the sign of 0HDMI. (b,c) Magneto-optical Kerr effect 
(MOKE) micrographs showing corresponding experimental results. We have spatially filtered and 
removed backgrounds from these representative micrographs for clarity. The Ar+ dose is approximately 
2 × 1016 cm-2 for (b) and approximately 2 × 1015 cm-2 for (c). Black dots indicate the approximate position 
of bubble nucleation. Blue and red rectangles indicate regions from which we take profiles to determine 
domain wall displacements. (d,e) Blue and red markers are profiles from boxed regions in (b) and (c)

averaged across the x direction. Black curves are arctangent fits used to extract domain wall 
displacements with standard uncertainties of approximately 400 nm.  

To perform a measurement of the DMI, we measure v as a function of By. The domain wall 

comprising the bubble has opposite symmetry on either side of the bubble with respect to By, so that in 
the reference frame of the domain wall the effective magnetic field By(eff) is opposite in sign for each side 
of the bubble. (Fig. 2, inset). Therefore, we resample the raw data, which includes multiple cycles of By, 
by averaging data points with By(eff) within 1 mT of each other (Fig. 2). This data comes from a region of 
the trilayer that we expose to 125 eV Ar+, with 0Hc ≈ 3 mT, and is an average of 12 By cycles. The similar 
behavior of the domain wall on both sides of the bubble indicates the preservation of the domain wall 
chirality around the bubble, which is typical for all bubbles in this study. The data does not show 
evidence for chiral damping [40], as it does not have a significant asymmetry about its minimum value 
(Supplemental Material S4). 

Fig. 2: Representative data shows a simultaneous measurement of the velocity v of a domain wall on the 
positive y (gray) and negative y (black) sides of a bubble. The domain wall moves similarly on both sides 
of the bubble in response to the effective magnetic field By(eff), with a reversed sign for opposite sides. 
We attribute the small difference between the curves to a misalignment of By which adds a z component 
to the total field. Standard uncertainties of v are approximately 0.2 mm∙s-1. Inset: Simulated data shows 
that By(eff) is opposite in sign for the domain wall on each side of the bubble, due to the opposite spatial 
symmetry.  

For a systematic study of the DMI, we obtain over 400 v curves such as those in Fig. 2, although 
averaging over only two cycles of By. To compare the results from many bubbles which may not have the 
same v, we normalize each curve to its value at By(eff) = 0, vnorm = v/v(By(eff)= 0). Additionally, we measure the 
mean vnorm of the domain wall on either side of the bubble, since it behaves similarly with response to 
By(eff) (Fig. 2). Typical standard uncertainties of vnorm after such averaging are about 0.01. Finally, after 
each bubble measurement, we determine the local 0Hc of the trilayer by measuring a hysteresis loop at 
the location of the bubble with a Bz ramp rate of approximately 20 mT∙s-1. Fig. 3 shows a selection of the 
vnorm curves (gray markers), arranged by EAr+ and 0Hc. We determine 0HDMI as the negative of the in-
plane field which minimizes the quadratic component of vnorm , defining positive 0HDMI as acting 
perpendicular to the surface of the domain wall, in the direction pointing from an Mz > 0 region to an 
Mz < 0 region [38,41]. This definition is consistent with positive 0HDMI leading to right-hand domain 
walls, and the DMI energy EDMI = -D (S1 × S2), with S1 and S2 representing the state of adjacent spins, and 
D the DMI vector. In Fig. 3, the 0Hc ≈ 5.0 mT row exemplifies tuning of 0HDMI by EAr+.

Fig. 3: Representative data shows the normalized domain wall velocity vnorm (gray markers) at six values 
of EAr+ for doses chosen to give three values of 0Hc. Black curves are the fits used to extract the value of 
Kpin and 0HDMI. The data sets at 0Hc ≈ 5.0 mT exemplify bipolar tuning of 0HDMI at constant 0Hc. 
Standard uncertainties of vnorm are typically 0.01, which is smaller than the data markers in most cases. 

Many of the curves show a peak in vnorm for By(eff) ≈ 0, for example, in the 0Hc ≈ 3.1 mT, EAr+ = 75 eV 

curve, which prevents fitting this data to a simple quadratic function to accurately extract 0HDMI. 
Previous studies have also reported this peak [31,40-42], ruling out experimental artifacts specific to our 
experiment. 

We propose a physical model as a possible explanation for the peak – a By-dependent perturbation 

to the prefactor v0 in the domain wall creep equation,
related to the domain wall surface tension, pinning potential, and temperature. In most cases 
[38,43,44], changes in κ dominate changes in domain wall velocity, but if the exponent is small or κ is 
insensitive to small values of By, then changes in v0 may dominate [40]. We believe that this is the case 
here, as the peak amplitude scales differently from the overall parabolic behavior of v in response to a 
changing Bz (not shown). The value of v0 depends on the attempt frequency  of the domain walls in the 

. In this equation,  is a quantity 

pinning potential Epin [45,46].  is proportional to the square root of the curvature 
 of the 
pinning potential. A field such as By changes the curvature by moving the configuration of the domain 
wall away from the minimum of Epin. Since the minimum of Epin corresponds to a maximum of 

 for most pinning potentials [40], it also corresponds to a maximum in Therefore, any 

deviation of the minimum energy configuration of the domain wall from its value at By = 0 will decrease 

 and thus v0, in an amount proportional to the square root of
. This explanation predicts a 
peak in vnorm at By = 0, as is evident if we model the pinning potential by an anisotropy energy minimum 
with equilibrium angle eq that varies around 0 as the field By varies:

In this model, M = 5 × 105 A∙m-1 is an estimate of the saturation magnetization, which we obtain 
from a previous study [47], and Kpin is the effective anisotropy constant for pinning. Since v0 is outside 
the exponent in the creep law which predicts domain wall motion, this modification manifests as a 
multiplicative correction to the domain wall creep law, which is approximately quadratic in By at low 
fields [38]. Therefore, using the method of damped least squares, we fit (Fig. 3, black lines) the vnorm 
curves to the product of a quadratic function which approximates the domain wall creep law with the 
DMI, and an approximation of relation (1) at eq ≈ 0 (Supplemental Material S5). This relation fits most of 
the features in the experimental data, and extracts values of Kpin and 0HDMI that are robust to the 
details of the fit.  

Using this model, we extract a value of Kpin = 6 kJ∙m-3 ± 2 kJ∙m-3, denoting the mean and standard 
deviation of 100 vnorm curves that show an appreciable central peak. This value is much smaller than 
typically measured values [43] of the uniaxial anisotropy constant K1, but we can reconcile this 
discrepancy by noting that the pinning potential should be more complicated than a simple uniaxial 
anisotropy. We do observe a correlation between Kpin and 0Hc (Supplemental Material S6), supporting 
our model of the peak in vnorm as an effective anisotropy.  

The values of 0HDMI that we extract show systematic variation as a function of 0Hc and EAr+ (Fig. 4, 
surface plot), which is the main result of our study – simultaneous control of 0HDMI and 0Hc. The color 
scale in Fig. 4 is a linear interpolation between the 0HDMI values obtained at the 0Hc and EAr+ conditions 
that the small black markers indicate. Regions of positive 0HDMI (blue) and negative 0HDMI (red) are 
visible, as is the contour separating them (black line). The values of 0HDMI have typical standard 
uncertainties of 1 mT. However, the scatter of the data, manifesting for example as irregularity of the 
black contour line, indicates that variation in 0HDMI due to heterogeneity of the trilayer exceeds the 
measurement uncertainty. We also confirm that Ar+ dose monotonically controls 0Hc by measuring 0Hc 
as a function of Ar+ dose for EAr+ = 100 eV (Fig. 4, inset). Supplemental Material Fig. S7 shows data over 
the full range of 0Hc and presents uncertainty evaluation. 

Fig. 4: A surface plot of 0HDMI shows systematic variation as a function of 0Hc and EAr+. Ar+ dose 
increases toward the bottom of this surface plot. The black contour indicates the boundary between 
positive (blue) and negative (red) 0HDMI. Circular black markers indicate the 0Hc and EAr+ values of the 
measurements between which the color map interpolates. The two large black markers indicate the 
approximate parameters corresponding to Supplemental Material S8. Inset: 0Hc decreases 
monotonically with Ar+ dose for a sample with EAr+ = 100 eV.  

To demonstrate spatial resolution of this tuning, we prepare two nearby regions of the trilayer to 
have the same 0Hc of 3.6 mT, but different values of 0HDMI, 20 mT and -20 mT, with exposure to 50 eV 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
Ar+ and 100 eV Ar+, respectively (large black markers, Fig. 4). These regions are close enough such that 
the effects of positive and negative 0HDMI are evident with identical By and Bz excitation, in the same 
field of view of the MOKE microscope (Supplemental Material S8). 

While both 0HDMI and 0Hc depend on spin-orbit coupling at the Pt/Co interfaces, our results 

indicate that they depend differently on the details of the layers and interfaces. A stopping and range of 
ions in matter (SRIM) simulation [48] (Supplementary Material S9) shows that around EAr+ = 100 eV, Ar+ 
primarily influences the top Pt and Co layers. Auger spectroscopy (Supplementary Material S9) does not 
show evidence of Ar implantation, and indicates that the change of the sign of 0HDMI is associated with 
removal of the top Pt monolayer. Although the different behavior of 0HDMI and 0Hc with EAr+ and Ar+ 
dose may be complicated, previous studies provide some guidance. Several studies [33-36] have shown 
that ion-induced interfacial disorder, and reduction of the thickness of the top Pt layer [49], decrease 
0Hc, while 0HDMI is primarily sensitive to the interfacial Pt monolayers [53]. Therefore, removal of the 
top Pt could affect 0HDMI in two ways, eliminating the positive influence of the layer on 0HDMI [50], and 
allowing oxidation of the Co [51,52].  

Eliminating the influence of the top Pt should have a strong influence on 0HDMI. The etch rate of Pt 
vanishes at lower EAr+ [54], and depends differently on EAr+ than interfacial disorder does. This suggests 
that, for a given thickness of etched Pt, higher energy Ar+ causes less interfacial disorder than lower 
energy Ar+, causing an EAr+ dependence of 0HDMI at fixed 0Hc. For example, exposure to 130 eV Ar+ 
leads to a large negative 0HDMI after removal of the top Pt layer, but 50 eV Ar+ causes enough disorder 
to drive the film to the spin reorientation transition at doses necessary to remove the top Pt layer. 

To test the effect of Co oxidation on 0HDMI, we deposit a layer of Au with a thickness of 

approximately 10 nm immediately after Ar+ irradiation in vacuum. After exposure to air, we measure 
similar values of 0HDMI with and without the Au layer (Supplementary Material S10). This suggests that 
Pt removal is the primary mechanism for our simultaneous control, but does not rule out oxidation as a 
factor, as we are not certain that the Au layer is hermetic, and we do not know of any influence of the 
Au itself on 0HDMI. Measurements in vacuum could elucidate these effects.  

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of Ar+ irradiation around 100 eV to tune the sign and 

magnitude of the DMI in ultrathin Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. The tuning is spatially variable, separately from 
0Hc. At low values of the DMI, we observe a peak in domain wall velocity which we propose to explain 
by a modification of the depinning attempt frequency in the creep regime of domain wall motion. This 
model may also explain a discrepancy between measurements of 0HDMI by domain wall motion and 
Brillouin light scattering [41], which do not account for the influence of the peak in domain wall velocity. 
Our technique for simultaneous control of 0HDMI and 0Hc on a single chip enables systematic study of 
the effects of the DMI in isolation from stronger interactions [55], and potentially allows micro- and 
nanopatterning of the DMI [56]. Finally, this new level of control will enable magnetic materials with 
engineered DMI for proposed and existing technological applications [57-59].

S1: Sample preparation 

We sputter the Pt/Co/Pt trilayer on a p-type silicon substrate by the following process. First, we 
perform in situ Ar+ etching at a power of 50 W for a duration of 120 s to remove any contaminants from 
the substrate. Next, we grow the bottom Pt layer with a base pressure of 5 × 10-4
pressure of 6.6 Pa, and a power of 100 W, which is optimal for film thickness uniformity. Then, we grow 
the Co layer at a sputtering pressure of 6.6 Pa and a power of 65 W. Finally, we grow the top Pt layer at 
a sputtering pressure of 6.6 Pa and a power of 60 W. The lower power for growth of the Co and top Pt 
layers reduces physical damage from atomic and ionic impacts to the existing interfaces of the layers [1]. 
All sputtering steps use a DC Ar+ plasma at a flow rate of 0.83 atm∙cm3∙s-1. 

 Pa, a sputtering 

We determine the thickness of the top Pt and Co layers by growing test films under identical 

sputtering conditions but longer deposition times, measuring their thickness by atomic force 
microscopy, and calculating their growth rates. In this way, we determine that the top Pt layer has a 
growth rate of 0.09 nm∙s-1 ± 0.01 nm∙s-1 and a thickness of 1.7 nm ± 0.3 nm, and the Co layer has a 
growth rate of 0.13 nm∙s-1 ± 0.02 nm∙s-1 and a thickness of 0.8 nm ± 0.1 nm. We propagate the standard 
uncertainty from test film thickness to top Pt and Co layer thickness. We measure X-ray reflectivity 
spectra of the trilayer (not shown) and use commercial software to fit them to a model that iteratively 
determines the thickness of the bottom Pt film as 35 nm ± 2 nm, which is consistent with the growth 
rate of the top Pt layer. We derive this limit of uncertainty from the uncertainties of the trilayer 
properties that we input into the model, such as interface roughness and thickness of the other layers. 
The 0HC of the trilayer as grown is approximately 80 mT, which is larger than the maximum field of 

the electromagnet that we use to apply Bz. Therefore, we do not measure the DMI in the trilayer as 
grown. After trilayer growth, we dice this wafer into chips to investigate the effects of Ar+ irradiation.

S2: Field excitation  

We use a bipolar, pulsed Bz waveform at a repetition frequency of 50 Hz to 150 Hz and an amplitude 

of 1 mT to 20 mT to measure magnetic bubble domains and the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya 
interaction (DMI) field 0HDMI (Fig. S2). Each cycle of the BZ waveform starts with a negative field pulse 
which saturates the magnetic state of the trilayer. Immediately after, a smaller positive pulse nucleates 
and expands bubbles for measurement. Finally, the magnetic field returns to a small, negative constant 
field, and remains at that field for bubble observation until the next pulse. The constant negative field 
ensures complete initialization after each measurement cycle, but is small enough that the domain walls 
under observation are approximately stationary. The duration of the constant field portion of the 
waveform is much larger than the total duration of the positive and negative pulses, so the image 
contrast is close to that of images of stationary bubbles. This BZ waveform induces bubbles at the 
repetition frequency, which is much higher than the imaging frequency of 10 Hz of our charge-coupled 
device (CCD) camera. In this way, each MOKE micrograph is the average of 5 to 15 bubble expansions, 
reducing noise by averaging over stochastic domain wall pinning. This BZ waveform allows continuous 
observation of bubble growth at tens of hertz.  

During excitation with this Bz waveform, each chip shows nucleation sites at an areal density of 
approximately 102 mm-2, enabling measurement of isolated bubbles. Earlier studies [2] have used more 
complicated protocols for Bz excitation, based on a nucleation pulse followed by measurement during a 
propagation pulse to eliminate possible effects due to inconsistent nucleation of bubbles. Here, we use 
only a single pulse to make the measurement faster. We verify that the results of single and double 
pulses are consistent (not shown). 

For excitation in the plane of the trilayer, we apply By in a triangular waveform at a frequency of 
50 mHz and an amplitude of 40 mT. This By frequency is much lower than the Bz repetition frequency 
and the imaging frequency, so that the position of each domain wall accurately indicates the influence 
of By on domain propagation velocity. The bubbles are sensitive to z-direction misalignment of By, so we 
adjust the angle of the trilayer at large values of By to minimize variations in the size of the expanded 
bubbles. We can measure single bubbles consistently for By up to approximately 20 mT to 40 mT. Higher 
values result in nucleation sites that are overly dense for measurement of single bubbles. 

Fig. S2: A simulation of the Bz excitation scheme shows a series of bipolar pulses that first saturate the 
sample in the negative direction and then drive domain walls for the measurement. The domain walls 
are approximately stationary during the long constant field portions of the waveform, so the contrast of 
the video data approaches that of still images of stationary bubbles. 

S3: Real-time image processing 

Bubbles appear in unprocessed MOKE micrographs as roughly circular patches (Fig. S3). Each MOKE 

micrograph averages over 5 to 15 bubble expansions, due to the repetition frequency of the Bz 
waveform of 50 Hz to 150 Hz and the imaging frequency of the CCD camera of 10 Hz. In real time, we 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
extract rectangular sections from these micrographs (Fig. S3, dashed line), average these sections in the 
vertical direction to generate one-dimensional profiles of the bubbles, and fit these profiles with a sum 
of two offset arctangent functions that model the domain walls. This empirical fit is a good 
approximation of the effects of stochastic domain wall pinning and broadening by optical diffraction, 
and provides super-resolution measurements of domain wall positions. This fit includes only the two 
domain wall positions as floating parameters to increase measurement speed, enabling the 
measurement of approximately 400 bubbles for this study and mapping of the DMI. The fit provides 
domain wall displacements with standard uncertainties of approximately 400 nm at 10 Hz. We calculate 
domain wall velocities by dividing the domain wall displacement by the Bz pulse duration, resulting in 
values of 10 mm∙s-1 to 50 mm∙s-1, with typical standard uncertainties of 0.8 mm∙s-1. 

Fig S3: An unprocessed MOKE micrograph shows a magnetic bubble domain. In real time, we extract 
rectangular sections from these micrographs, outlined above with a dashed black line, average these 
sections in the vertical direction to generate one-dimensional profiles of the bubbles, and fit the profiles 
with a sum of two offset arctangent functions that empirically model the domain walls. 

S4: Absence of chiral damping 

A recent study [3] proposed that damping of spin precession, depending on the chirality of the spin 

texture and separately from the effects of DMI, could lead to a non-zero minimum in domain wall 
velocity as a function of in-plane field. To investigate this possibility, we replot the domain wall velocity 
curves from Fig. 2 as a function of By, with one curve offset along the x-axis (Fig. S4). If chiral damping 
were a factor in these measurements, then there would be a significant asymmetry between the two 
curves, which we do not observe. 

Fig. S4: A damping term which depends on the chirality of the domain wall would manifest as a 
significant asymmetry between the negative y domain wall velocity curve (black) and the positive y 
domain wall velocity curve which we have offset along the x-axis (gray). We do not observe this 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
asymmetry in our data, ruling out the effects of chiral damping in our samples. Standard uncertainties 
for the data in Fig. S4 and Fig. 2 are approximately 0.2 mm∙s-1, which we determine from the standard 
deviations of the values of each resampled point. 

S5: Fit function 

We assume that the equilibrium angle between the pinned moment within the domain wall and the 

surface normal, 

, 

is close to zero. For numerical convenience in the fitting procedure we approximate v0 around eq = 0, 

where 

, 

We fit our experimental vnorm curves with this expression, absorbing the prefactor and proportionality 
constant into a single fit parameter representing the amplitude of the peak.  

. 

S6: Correlation of pinning anisotropy and coercive field 

We extract a value of the anisotropy constant for pinning Kpin from each domain wall velocity ṽ curve 

that shows a peak near By(eff) = 0. We find a correlation between values of Kpin and local values of 0Hc, 
with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) of approximately 0.3 (Fig. S6). 

Fig. S6: Values of Kpin from domain wall velocity curves show a correlation with locally measured values 
of 0Hc. Standard uncertainties for Kpin values are around 1 kJ∙m-3, which we determine from the fits. 

S7: Measurement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) over full range of coercive field 

A surface plot (Fig. S7) of the DMI field 0HDMI over the full range of data from our study. The full 

range of data shows that positive 0HDMI persists to high coercive field 0HC.

Fig. S7: A surface plot shows the full range of 0HDMI values that we measure as a function of 0Hc and 
EAr+. The black contour indicates the interpolated boundary between positive (blue) and negative (red) 
0HDMI. Black markers are measurement results which form the basis of the color map, which is a linear 
interpolation. Standard uncertanties of 0HDMI have a mean value of approximately 1 mT, which we 
derive from the fits for the data in this plot. The limit of uncertanty of the 0Hc values is 0.3 mT, which 
we determine by the field sampling rate when performing the hysteresis measurements on the film. The 
limit of uncertainty of the EAr+ values is 1 eV, which we estimate from the uncertainty of the energy 
adjustment mechanism of the Ar+ source. 

S8: Simultaneous observation of opposite signs of DMI on the same chip 

Supplemental S8 shows bubble growth in two regions of the same chip with opposite signs of 
0HDMI. We expose the region on the left to 50 eV Ar+ and the region on the right to 100 eV Ar+ (Fig. S8, 
top). We prepare the two regions to have similar 0Hc, enabling simultaneous observation with the same 
Bz excitation waveform. In Fig. S8, the Bz waveform is as we describe in Supplementary S2, such that the 
growth of the bubbles is invisible but the relative velocity of the domain walls during growth is 
detectable by their positions. Magnified regions of interest within the yellow boxes are at the bottom of 
Fig. S8. These show bubbles under exposure to an in-plane field By with an amplitude of approximately 
40 mT in two different directions. The opposite sign of 0HDMI for the two regions is evident as the 
opposite direction of bubble expansion in response to the same By. Fig. S8 has opposite contrast relative 
to the other data in the rest of the manuscript, so the bubbles appear as dark on a light background.

bubbles in two regions of the trilayer. Yellow boxes highlight two bubbles which demonstrate the

and negative direction By with approximate magnitude of 40 mT. The opposite sign of the DMI is evident 
as opposite direction of bubble movement in response to the same By and Bz. 

S9: Effects of Ar+ irradiation 

We perform a stopping and range of ions (SRIM) simulation of Ar+ penetration into the trilayer. The 
simulation is of 100 eV Ar+ incident normally on a Pt/Co(0.8 nm)/Pt(0.3 nm) trilayer with a Pt density of 
21 g∙cm-3
of 1.7 nm accounts for its removal by an experimental Ar+ dose of approximately 1 × 1015 cm-2. This 
simulation shows that approximately 97 % of Ar+ ions stop before the bottom Co/Pt interface (Figure S9, 
top), indicating that the Ar+ irradiation has a larger influence on the top Pt/Co interface. 

 and a Co density of 8.9 g∙cm-3. The reduction in thickness of the top Pt from the as-grown value 

We use Auger spectroscopy to determine the elemental composition of the top surface of the 
trilayer. We take Auger spectra from areas of the trilayer irradiated with different doses of 100 eV Ar+, 
without exposing the trilayer to air. At doses larger than approximately 2 × 1014 cm-2, the Auger spectra 
exhibit three peaks at energies characteristic of Co (Fig. S9, middle, mean of all spectra taken in this 
study), but they do not show evidence for Ar implantation in our trilayers (Fig. S9, middle, inset). This is 
consistent with the chemically inert Ar diffusing out of the trilayer after irradiation. The integrated 
intensity of the Co peaks is a qualitative indicator of the fraction of Co on the surface of the sample, 
which increases until a dose of approximately 20 × 1014 cm-2 (Fig. S9, bottom), indicating that this dose 
fully etches the top Pt layer. This is consistent with the etch rate of Pt in response to 100 eV Ar+ in our 
system, as well as the thickness of the top Pt layer. We then characterize perpendicular anisotropy and 
the DMI on the same areas to correlate surface composition with the DMI. The 0HDMI = 0 point occurs 
at doses less than those that cause the Co peaks to have maximum intensity, indicating that the 0HDMI = 
0 point occurs after the removal of some, but not all, of the top Pt monolayer. This plot also indicates 
the dose of Ar+ exposure at this energy to reach the spin reorientation transition (SRT) of the trilayer.

Fig. S9: Effects of Ar+ irradiation on the trilayer. Top: SRIM simulation results indicate that approximately 
97 % of 100 eV Ar+ ions do not penetrate to the bottom Co/Pt interface, therefore influencing the top 
Pt/Co interface more. Vertical bars are limits of uncertainty corresponding to the unknown thickness of 
the top Pt layer. Middle: Three peaks in the Auger energy spectrum indicate the presence of Co in the 
top 1 nm of the trilayer. This spectrum is the mean of all spectra from this Auger study. Inset: Auger 
spectra do not show evidence of Ar implantation, which would manifest as a peak at 211 eV. The axes of 
the inset are the same as those of the main plot. Typical values of measurement uncertainty for Auger 
intensity are approximately 0.01, in the arbitrary units of the plot. We estimate this uncertainty as the 
standard deviation of Auger intensities at regions of the spectra with no evident peaks. Bottom: The 
integrated intensity of the three peaks increases above the background at 100 eV Ar+
 doses of larger 
than approximately 2 × 1014 cm-2, and stops increasing after a dose of approximately 20 × 1014 cm-2. The 
increasing integrated intensity of the Co peaks indicates the removal of the top Pt layer, and coincides 
with 0HDMI = 0, which we measure after Auger spectroscopy with MOKE microscopy. The tick mark 
labeled “SRT” indicates the Ar+ dose required to reach the spin reorientation transition. Vertical bars are 
standard uncertainties, which we obtain from the spectral values integrated to obtain the data.  

S10: Au layer 

We investigate the possible effects of Co oxidation on 0HDMI in a trilayer region with a nominal 0HC 
of 2 mT and EAr+ = 100 mT. Auger spectroscopy (S9) shows that, with these parameters, the trilayer has a 

15 

 
 
 
 
partially exposed Co top surface and an opposite sign of 0HDMI relative to regions of the trilayer with an 
intact Pt top surface, so any effects of oxidation should be present. We deposit a layer of Au with a 
nominal thickness of 10 nm on part of this region after Ar+ irradiation, without breaking vacuum and 
exposing the sample to air. This Au layer is thick enough to reduce oxidation of Co but thin enough to 
allow light transmission for MOKE microscopy, and has a visible optical density. After exposure to air, we 
measure three bubbles on a region with the Au layer, and three bubbles on a region without the Au 
layer, averaging the vnorm curves (Fig. S10). We find that 0HDMI is similar for these two regions, 
suggesting that oxidation does not play a dominant role in altering 0HDMI. 

Fig. S10: Comparison of vnorm curves from a region of the trilayer with (gold) and without (black) an Au 
layer to reduce Co oxidation. The 0HDMI values from fitting these curves, -3.3 mT ± 0.5 mT 
and -4.6 ± 0.5 mT are similar. We derive standard uncertainties of vnorm from the fits to extract vnorm, and 
standard uncertainties of 0HDMI by propagating the uncertainty of the vnorm measurement through the 
quadratic fit to extract 0HDMI.
