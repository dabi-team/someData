Abstract

An overview of quantum-mechanical methods to generate cross-section data for electron collisions

with atoms and molecules is presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the time-independent

close-coupling approach, since it is particularly suitable for low-energy collisions and also allows

for systematic improvements as well as uncertainty estimates. The basic ideas are illustrated with

examples for electron collisions with argon atoms and methane. For many atomic systems, such as

e-Ar collisions, highly reliable cross sections can now be computed with quantiﬁed uncertainties.

On the other hand, while electron collision calculations with molecules do provide key input data

for plasma models, the methods and computer codes presently used require further development

to make these inputs robust.

INTRODUCTION

Electron collisions with atoms, ions, and molecules are well known to be of critical im-

portance in the understanding and the modeling of laboratory and technological plasmas,

astrophysical processes, lasers, and planetary atmospheres — to name just a few examples.

Since the principal motivation of benchmark experiments in this ﬁeld has been the test

of theoretical models in as much detail as possible, without averaging, for example, over

unpolarized initial beams and summing or integrating over unresolved observables in the

ﬁnal state, many of these experiments produce data that are diﬀerential in energy, angle,

and even the spin of the particles involved. On the other hand, plasma modelers often

need angle-integrated cross sections over extended energy ranges to calculate the relevant

rate coeﬃcients, sometimes resolved for particular initial and ﬁnal states and sometimes

just lumped over a number of possibilities. Of particular importance, however, is the need

for absolute cross sections, which are notoriously diﬃcult to obtain in experimental setups,

especially in state-to-state resolved transitions involving neutral targets. Some information

and additional references can be found in [1].

Furthermore, state-of-the art plasma modeling often requires data for a very large number

of atomic and molecular processes [2]. It is virtually impossible to determine all the quanti-

ties needed by experimental means. The reason is not just the cost involved, but rather the

fact that certain cross sections, which may be important in simulations of particular plasma

environments, are not accessible to standard crossed-beam or gas-cell setups. Examples in-

clude transitions between excited states, especially if the initial state is not even metastable,

and essentially all collisional data involving open-shell molecules, which are generally known

as radicals. As a result, plasma modelers increasingly rely on theoretical predictions, rather

than on educated guesses for the relevant cross sections and rate coeﬃcients.

In light of the enormous progress made in both computational hardware and software, it

has indeed become possible to generate a large amount of the required data by numerical

means, and the results are typically collected in databases. Some information can be found

in [3, 4].

Interestingly, the concept of uncertainty estimates, i.e., an assessment of the

reliability of particular theoretical predictions, has only recently drawn signiﬁcant attention

among both data users and data producers. While the publishers of experimental data are

routinely expected to provide some uncertainly estimates (as diﬃcult as this may be for

2

systematic errors), this has not been a widely practiced tradition for theorists [5].

The present manuscript is organized as follows. We begin with a brief overview of

quantum-mechanical methods developed for electron collisions with atoms and molecules,

before concentrating on the time-independent close-coupling (CC) approach, which has been

extensively used to obtain data for low-energy and more recently also for intermediate-energy

collisions. After illustrating the basic ideas for electron-atom scattering, the extensions

needed to handle molecular targets are outlined. The eﬀect of various approximations, their

advantages and shortcomings, are then illustrated for electron collisions with argon atoms

and methane. Unless mentioned otherwise, atomic units are used throughout this paper.

II. OVERVIEW OF NUMERICAL APPROACHES

There is a wealth of literature available on methods for electron scattering calculations.

Instead of repeating this information in great detail, only the minimum framework needed

for understanding the basic ideas will be presented here. For a more thorough treatment

and overviews, standard textbooks on collision theory and recent reviews [6–10] should be

consulted. Some descriptions and example computer programs for atomic structure and

collisions can be found in [11]. In this paper, we will illustrate the basic principles on a few

concrete examples that are well known to be important for plasma applications.

Unfortunately, there is no unambiguous rule regarding the reliability of a particular

method. Nevertheless, as will be discussed further below, the collision energy is an im-

portant parameter that can provide some general guidelines. More details, in particular

with regard to estimating the uncertainty and the reliability of theoretical predictions, can

be found in [12].

Numerical approaches for atomic collision processes, and in particular for electron-atom

and electron-molecule collisions, are often classiﬁed as perturbative or non-perturbative, as

well as time-dependent or time-independent. Time-dependent formulations are based on the

time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE),

i

∂
∂t

|Ψ(X, t)(cid:105) = H(X, P , t)|Ψ(X, t)(cid:105).

(1)

for the wavefunction |Ψ(X, t)(cid:105), or – in a fully relativistic framework – on the corresponding

Dirac equation. Here X collective denotes all spatial (ri, i = 1, ..., N + 1) coordinates and

3

spin projections (σi) of the N target electrons plus the projectile. The operator H is the

Hamiltonian, containing the kinetic energy K of the particles and their potential energy V

in the ﬁeld of the target nucleus as well as their mutual interaction. If written in coordinate

space, the momentum operator P (again representing collectively the linear momenta of all

N +1 electrons) acts as a derivative operator with respect to the coordinates. In principle, H

may contain an explicit time dependence (for example, in short-pulse laser-atom/molecule

interactions), but here we will concentrate on steady-state scenarios and only consider the

time-independent kinetic and potential energies mentioned above.

The TDSE is a partial-diﬀerential equation that can be solved as an initial-value problem

by propagating a known (prepared) initial state, usually the product of a wavepacket for the

projectile and the initial state of the target, in time until the collision process is ﬁnished.

In the “time-dependent close-coupling” (TDCC) [13] approach, the (N + 1)-electron wave-

function is expanded in some suitable form (see also below), and the relevant information

is extracted from the propagated solution using a number of diﬀerent techniques. While

TDCC has been successful for some benchmark studies, particularly in the description of

electron-impact ionization processes, it is not widely used for production calculations of

atomic or molecular data. Hence we will not consider it further in this paper.

Since the collision processes of interest here are steady-state scenarios, the calculations

can also be performed using a time-independent formulation. This requires the solution of

the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation (TISE),

H(X, P )|ψE(X)(cid:105) = E|ψE(X)(cid:105)

(2)

for the wavefunction of the collision system for a ﬁxed total energy E, subject to particular

boundary conditions for the projectile and the target. For ionization processes in particu-

lar, these boundary conditions are very complex. As a result, the proper matching in the

asymptotic region is a major challenge, when two (or even more) free electrons are far away

from the charged residual target ion. While this challenge has been addressed, for example,

by the technique of “exterior complex scaling” (ECS) [14], that method has not been used

extensively for production calculations either.

It is also possible to formulate the problem in momentum space. In this case one solves

the Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation for the transition matrix, from which all observable

parameters, such as cross sections, for the collision can be derived. One of several ways to

4

express the LS equation is [15]

(cid:104)kf Φf |T |kiΦi(cid:105) = (cid:104)kf Φf |V |Ψ+

i (cid:105).

(3)

Here |kiΦi(cid:105) and |kf Φf (cid:105) are the initial and ﬁnal asymptotic states, namely plane or Coulomb

waves for the projectile with initial (ﬁnal) linear momentum ki (kf ) and the corresponding

N -electron target states Φf (Φf ), while T is the transition operator. Alternatively, T can

be replaced by the simpler interaction operator V if the exact solution of the scattering

problem (here denoted as |Ψ+

i (cid:105)) is used instead. The formal solution for |Ψ+

i (cid:105) is given by

|Ψ+

i (cid:105) = |kiΦi(cid:105) +

1
E(+) − K

V |Ψ+
i (cid:105)

(4)

where K is the kinetic-energy operator and the superscript “(+)” indicates the appropriate

boundary conditions.

Both the TDSE in coordinate space and the LS equation can only be solved exactly for

model problems. The LS formulation, however, not only allows for a non-perturbative treat-

ment using the ideas of “convergent close-coupling” (CCC) [9] in momentum space, but also

for a systematic derivation and classiﬁcation of the above-mentioned perturbative methods.

Equation (4) in particular, provides an iteration scheme for the determination of |Ψ+

i (cid:105). Start-
ing with just the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side, one obtains the ﬁrst-order “Plane-Wave (or

Coulomb-Wave) Born Approximation” (PWBA or CWBA), in which the projectile-target

interaction is treated as a perturbation, i.e., one only needs the matrix elements of this

interaction between otherwise unperturbed zero-order wavefunctions. Higher-order versions

of this formulation can also be derived, and the method can be further improved by treat-

ing part of the interaction more accurately through the use of “distorted” rather than plane

waves, thereby resulting in variants of the “Distorted-Wave Born Approximation” (DWBA).

Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to estimate the uncertainty of theoretical predictions based on

these perturbative formulations, since higher-order terms are diﬃcult to calculate. Hence

their importance often remains unknown — unless comparison with experiment or results

from reliable non-perturbative calculations are available.

For completeness, we also mention the existence of semi-empirical methods, such as the

“Binary Encounter f-scaling” (BEf) [16] and “Binary Encounter Bethe” (BEB) [17] ap-

proaches to electron-impact excitation and ionization. While these methods are useful in

practice, they are somewhat limited in scope. For example, BEf can only be used for op-

tically allowed transitions and also requires experimental or reliable theoretical data for

5

rescaling. Once again, it appears practically impossible to suggest a method for assign-

ing an uncertainty associated with these approaches other than by benchmarking against

experiment.

In the next section, we will concentrate on just one method, namely time-independent

close-coupling formulated in coordinate space. This is a non-perturbative approach that,

in principle, allows for the solution of the TISE. In practice, of course, the method has

limitations as well, both regarding the basic formulation (e.g., how to include the proper

boundary condition for ionization processes), the physics accounted for (e.g., the neglect or

approximate treatment of relativistic eﬀects), and numerical aspects (e.g., the discretization

of derivatives and integrals). These aspects will be discussed in some detail below.

III. TIME-INDEPENDENT CLOSE-COUPLING IN COORDINATE SPACE

Time-independent close-coupling has been the method of choice for treating low-energy

electron collisions for many years. It is based upon an expansion of the total wavefunction

for a collision system in terms of a sum of products that are constructed from N -electron

target states Φi and functions FE,i describing the motion of the projectile for a total (target

+ projectile) collision energy E. If relativistic eﬀects are neglected, the total symmetry of

the scattering system, Γ, comprises a total spin S and a parity π; for atoms the orbital

angular momentum L is also conserved while for molecules this property depends on the

(point-group) symmetry of the molecule. The wavefunction for each Γ is, in its general form,

expanded as

ΨΓ(x1, . . . , xN , x) = A

(5)

This results in symmetry-dependent “partial waves” that have to be summed until conver-

gence is reached.

(cid:82)
In Eq. (5), Σ

denotes a sum over all discrete and an integral over all

continuum states of the target, and A is the antisymmetrization operator that accounts for

the indistinguishability of the projectile and the target electrons. Furthermore, the angular

and spin coordinates of the projectile electron have been coupled with the target states to

produce the “channel functions” ΦΓ

i (x1, . . . , xN , ˆx). The second sum in the ﬁrst term is
needed because some atomic and all molecular collisions require the consideration of more

6

than one set of asymptotic functions for a given target state and overall symmetry. The

second term in Eq. (5) contains wavefunctions where the scattering electron is placed in

orbitals associated with the target; this term is sometimes called “L2” as it only contains

(cid:82)
localized functions which are L2-integrable. The L2 term is not required if the ﬁrst Σ

term is

complete, but it is actually a feature of many practical implementations of CC procedures.

The unknown coeﬃcients aΓ

k are determined in the calculation; in the R-matrix
method [7, 8], for example, these are the eigenvector coeﬃcients obtained from diagonaliz-

i,j and bΓ

ing an (inner region) Hamiltonian matrix.

The target states Φi are usually chosen as multi-conﬁguration expansions. They are

generally not eigenstates of the N -electron target Hamiltonian, but rather diagonalize it

according to

(cid:104)Φi(cid:48)|H N

T |Φi(cid:105) = Eiδi(cid:48)i.

(6)

As will be further outlined below, this diagonalization property can be very useful in gener-

ating so-called “pseudo-states”.

For atomic systems, the radial wavefunctions FE,i(r) for the projectile are determined

from the solution of a system of coupled integro-diﬀerential equations given by

with the direct coupling potentials Vij(r) and the exchange terms WijFE,j(r). While it is

diﬃcult to write out these potentials explicitly, they can be evaluated by existing computer

programs. For molecules equations of this form are used to generate a suitable set of basis

functions with which to represent these functions [18].

In this case, however, only very

simpliﬁed potentials are usually employed.

The collision problem essentially consists of ﬁnding the solution to this system of coupled

equations for each total energy subject to the appropriate boundary conditions. This can

be achieved by various iterative, non-iterative, or algebraic methods. A frequently used

approach is the R-matrix method developed by Burke and collaborators in Belfast over the

past few decades. A comprehensive summary of a large variety of R-matrix applications

has been given by Burke [8]. Also, a suite of computer codes for atomic and ionic targets

was published [19] and updates are available, for example, from Badnell’s website [20].

Similarly, the UK Molecular R-matrix codes have been routinely updated and published

7

over time [21–23]. The current implementation, known as UKRMol [23], is obtainable via

the open-access CCPForge program repository and can be run through the Quantemol-N

expert system [24]. An updated version, known as UKRMol+, which copies the latest atomic

codes and uses B-spline basis functions to represent the radial part of the channel functions,

is currently being developed [25].

When inserted into the non-relativistic TISE, Eq. (5) should allow for an accurate solu-

tion. In practice, however, the sum over the (countable) inﬁnite number of target bound

states and the integral over the (uncountable) ionization continuum cannot be carried out

by any computational implementation. In the following, we will assume that purely numer-

ical aspects, such as the discretization of the radial grid in the evaluation of derivatives and

integrals, can be suﬃciently well controlled that errors are practically negligible compared to

the approximations made regarding the underlying physics. The principal issue of concern,

therefore, is the approximate treatment of these inﬁnite sums.

It turns out that the collision energy is an important, though unfortunately not the only,

parameter that can be used to construct sensible approximations from the close-coupling

expansion. For elastic collisions, a one-state CC expansion provides a start. In other words,

only the state of interest (generally the ground state, although this is not formally required)

is kept in the CC expansion. When written out explicitly, this CC-1 model (where the “1”

indicates the number of states kept in the CC expansion) leads to an integro-diﬀerential

equation for the projectile wavefunction, due to the non-local character of the exchange

term W11 in Eq. (7). This is called the “static exchange” (SE) approximation. Sometimes

the non-local term is neglected or replaced by local approximations, thereby reducing the

problem to so-called “potential scattering”.

As will be discussed below, even when elastic scattering is the only “open” channel, i.e.,

the projectile does not have enough energy to produce any excitation in the target, CC-1

is often not suﬃciently accurate. This is due to the fact that the charged projectile can

polarize the charge cloud of the target.

If the target does not have a permanent dipole

moment, this leads to an asymptotically attractive potential, which is proportional to the

electric dipole polarizability and falls oﬀ as 1/r4 at large distances from the target center.

While higher multipole terms may also enter, this is the leading term. The CC expansion

can account for this eﬀect by including all states (energetically open or closed) that can be

reached by optically allowed transitions from any given state. This immediately brings the

8

problem back to an inﬁnite expansion, and hence further simpliﬁcations must be sought.

These are:

• For some targets, especially the alkali atoms Li, Na, K, . . . , the coupling of the ground

state to the ﬁrst optically excited state (e.g., 3s−3p in Na) is so strong that a CC-2 ex-

pansion with just these two states can give good results for elastic scattering. Further-

more, a CC-4 expansion, also including the 4s and 3d states, is generally appropriate

for excitation of the 3p state [26].

• For molecules, an extension of the SE approximation, which is still widely used in

studies of elastic scattering, is the “static exchange plus polarization” (SEP) approx-

imation. In terms of Eq. (7), this approximation uses a CC-1 model augmented by

the L2 terms obtained by performing single excitations from the target wavefunction.

The SEP model has proved to be rather eﬀective for obtaining converged results for

low-lying shape resonances [27, 28].

• If the convergence of the CC expansion is very slow, and a large portion of the dipole

polarizability even comes from coupling to the ionization continuum [29], a pseudo-

state may be constructed that reproduces the desired polarizability. Such CC-2-pol

models can be very successful in low-energy elastic electron collisions, for example,

with noble gases. An example will be shown in the next section.

• Often the non-local character of the polarization potential is simpliﬁed again by deﬁn-

ing a local approximation for this potential, thereby reducing the problem once again

to simple potential scattering. In some cases, imaginary “optical potentials” [30] are

used to account for the possibility of excitation and ionization processes, i.e., loss of

ﬂux from the elastic channel.

Another important energy range is the near-threshold regime, which is often aﬀected, or

even dominated, by resonances. In this case the CC expansion needs to contain a number

of n discrete states, and hence the resulting models will be referred to as “CC-n”. This

approach has been the method of choice for many years. It is indeed often highly successful

in the description of resonances associated with low-lying inelastic thresholds. Following up

on the discussion above, however, the method may have problems in the low-energy regime

if signiﬁcant polarization eﬀects originate from coupling to higher-lying discrete states and,

9

in particular, the ionization continuum. Hence, the CC-n method usually does not give

results of equal (or even similar) quality for all transitions between the states included in

the expansion.

For intermediate-energy collisions, the above-mentioned eﬀect of coupling to discrete

states omitted in the CC-n expansion, and even more importantly to the ionization contin-

uum, should therefore be accounted for in some way. This can be done by extending the CC

expansion with a number of pseudo-states, which are essentially ﬁnite-range states that are

forced to ﬁt into a box. This can be done by limiting the above-mentioned diagonalization

of the target Hamiltonian to a ﬁnite spatial regime, outside of which all target orbitals must

either vanish completely or fall of suﬃciently fast with the distance from the center of the

box. For the basic idea, the details of the box (“hard” or “soft”) are not important; it only

matters that the states are L2-integrable and provide a way to discretize the (countable) inﬁ-

nite Rydberg and the continuous ionization spectra. This is the general principle behind the

“convergent close-coupling” (CCC) [9] and “R-matrix with Pseudo-States” (RMPS) [31, 32]

approaches. While the implementations may vary greatly, the essential idea is exactly the

same in both methods. Hence, if the same states (physical and pseudo) are included in the

expansion, the ﬁnal results should be the same.

Recent CCC calculations [33] for electron-H2 collisions have demonstrated that this

method indeed provides a complete treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom over

a wide range of energies. However, so far the CCC methodology has been restricted to the

treatment of collisions with relatively simple, few-electron targets.

For H2 it is possible to get very reliable representations of electronically excited states and

hence electronic impact excitation cross sections [34], but this is hard for the general case.

Sophisticated quantum chemical methods are available for treating electronically excited

states for small molecules, largely based on procedures such as multi-reference conﬁguration

interaction [35]. At present, however, these wavefunctions cannot be used directly as the

input for electron-molecule scattering calculations, for several reasons: (a) the formulation

given in Eq. (5) requires a single set of orbitals for all states while the best results are

obtained with orbital sets optimised for each state [36]; (b) it is diﬃcult to create a balanced

model for electron scattering based on an MRCI target wavefunction; (c) excited states of

molecules rapidly become very diﬀuse and are therefore hard to treat, at least within the

conﬁnes of an R-matrix procedure; and (d) treatments involving electron collisions with

10

complicated target wavefunctions rapidly become prohibitively computationally expensive.

See Halmov´a et al. [37] for an illustrative discussion of this last point.

Moving on to the high-energy regime, we note that the CC expansion can be linked to

perturbative formulations, in that ultimately only the initial and ﬁnal (if diﬀerent) states

need to be kept in the CC expansion. The transition-matrix elements can then be obtained

as integrals between simpliﬁed target wavefunctions, using some variants of the PWBA,

CWBA, of DWBA formulations [38]. Such approximations are also frequently used for

partial waves with high angular momenta, which may be needed to “top up” the results

to guarantee convergence of the partial-wave expansion. The physical justiﬁcation for this

procedure lies in the fact that the centrifugal barrier keeps these parts of the projectile

wavefunction rather far away from the target and hence reduces the eﬀects of the complex

short-range interactions.

Finally, other important issues concern the structure description itself and the way to

account for relativistic eﬀects if desired. As a rule of some thumb, quasi-one and quasi-two

electron systems, such as the alkali and the alkali-earth elements, are well described by one

or two valence electrons outside of a closed core — provided, of course, that one is only

interested in transitions involving these valence electrons. More complex targets, such as

the noble gases beyond helium and molecules with more than two active electrons, are much

harder to describe, since any excited or ionized state leads to multiple open shells with non-

zero orbital and spin angular momenta. In general, targets with partially ﬁlled subshells can

be very challenging. Consequently, great care has to be taken to ensure that the structure

description is suﬃciently accurate for the subsequent collision calculation to make sense at

all [12].

Relativistic eﬀects are generally more important for heavier rather than lighter targets,

but the details again depend on whether or not the ﬁne-structure is resolved in the process

to be described. Going beyond simply neglecting these eﬀects entirely, the following three

methods are typically applied:

• Recouple results from a non-relativistic model into a relativistic scheme using only

angular-momentum algebra (Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients, Racah symbols, etc.)

• Include these eﬀects as a ﬁrst-order perturbation, i.e., calculate matrix elements of op-

erators such as the spin-orbit interaction between properly (re)coupled non-relativistic

11

wavefunctions and include these matrix elements when setting up the interaction ma-

trix.

• Formulate the entire problem in the Dirac framework.

So far only the recoupling approach has been applied to treat spin-orbit eﬀects in molecules

and then only in limited circumstances [39]. An analogous recoupling approach is routinely

used to treat rotational excitation in molecules [40]. The evidence is that this method works

rather well [41, 42], but in general rotational distributions are either treated as thermalized

or simply ignored in state-of-the-art plasma models. Consequently, there has not been a

demand for rotational excitation cross sections from plasma modelers with the exception

of astronomers modelling weakly ionized regions of interstellar medium. Molecules with

permanent dipole moments, however, display very strong forward scattering, which is hard

to measure experimentally. Theory provides the best means for correcting for this [43].

Without going into further details (some can be found in [12]), we only mention here that

quantum-electric ﬁeld eﬀects can be safely neglected in the electron collision calculations of

interest for this paper. Furthermore, if eﬀects due to the hyperﬁne-structure play a role (this

is most important if the radiation emitted from excited states is depolarized), this would

once again be accounted for by recoupling only. See [44], for example.

IV.

ILLUSTRATION: ELECTRON COLLISIONS WITH ARGON ATOMS

We will now illustrate some of the concepts outlined above. Since it is a topic of sig-

niﬁcant interest for plasma physics and also a good candidate to show the eﬀects of the

various approximations, we use exclusively electron collisions with Ar atoms in this section

on electron-atom collisions. A larger variety of cases can be found in [10] and [12].

The numerical results presented here were obtained with the B-spline R-matrix (BSR)

method (see [45] for an overview) and the associated computer code [46] for solving the

close-coupling equations. The BSR method has some practical advantages when it comes to

obtaining an accurate target description, due to its ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of

one-electron orbitals to build up the multi-electron states. As mentioned above and will be

shown with an example below, this is a very important issue in some cases. A relativistic

version is also available [47]. Since its original publication, the computer code has been

optimized and parallelized to allow for the use of a large number of pseudo-states. This

enables the description of ionization processes and also allows for systematic convergence

studies of the CC expansion. Following the previously introduced naming convention, our

models will thus be labeled BSR-n to indicate the number of coupled states.

A. Elastic Scattering and Momentum Transfer

Figure 1 shows the results for elastic e-Ar collisions, as obtained with four diﬀerent

approximations, namely BSR-1, BSR-5, BSR-2-pol, and BSR-500 [48]. Speciﬁcally, these

models contain just the ground state (BSR-1), the ground state plus the lowest four excited

states with predominant conﬁguration 3p54s (BSR-5), the ground state plus a single pseudo-

state to reproduce the dipole polarizability, and a total of 500 states (BSR-500). The latter

set consists of the lowest 31 physical bound states, 47 pseudo-states with energies below

the ionization threshold to account for coupling to the high-lying Rydberg states, and 422

further pseudo-states to simulate the eﬀects of the ionization continuum.

Looking at the various predictions, we see that the Ramsauer-Townsend minimum is

completely missed by the BSR-1 model and hardly seen in the BSR-5 curve. BSR-2-pol, on

the other hand, obtains the basic energy dependence of the cross section, with the minimum

around an energy of 0.3 eV – just as the very extensive BSR-500 model. Clearly, a properly

constructed single pseudostate can handle this particular problem very well.

The accuracy of the fully ab initio BSR-500 model is illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, where

its predictions are compared with a number of experimental data for elastic scattering and

the momentum-transfer cross section, respectively. The overall agreement is excellent.

B. Excitation

Figure 4 is another example of the impressive progress that the BSR method has achieved

in the description of the near-threshold regime. The resonance structure in the metastable

excitation function is reproduced in excellent agreement with the experimental data [70], ex-

cept for an overall renormalization factor of 0.53, which is still within the overall experimen-

tal uncertainty. The principal reason for the improvement over a previous semi-relativistic

Breit-Pauli R-matrix calculation (BPRM-41 [72]) in this case is the improvement in the

description of the target states in this energy region. Although BSR-31 is very good for

obtaining this particular cross section, we emphasize that the model would not be not suﬃ-

cient for either low-energy elastic scattering (see above) or the intermediate-energy regime

discussed next.

coupling expansion [81]. We see the enormous eﬀect of accounting for coupling to both

high-lying discrete states and the ionization continuum on the results for these transitions

from the ground state to the ﬁrst four excited states. The eﬀect is particularly strong for

the metastable 4s[3/2]2 and 4s(cid:48)[1/2]0 states. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the coupling

eﬀect also prevails for the excited states with electronic angular momentum J = 1 for

incident energies at least up to 100 eV. This fact suggests that simple models, such as a

distorted-wave approach, would not be appropriate until such comparatively high energies.

Semi-empirical ﬁxes to such models, as suggested by Kim [16] with so-called “BEf-scaling”,

may help. However, such methods are limited to particular situations, and success is by no

means guaranteed due to the lack of a ﬁrm theoretical foundation.

Figure 6 exhibits the results again, this time as a comparison between the predictions from

the BSR-31 and BSR-500 models with experimental data from several groups. Without going

into detail, we note that the energy dependence seen in many of the individual experimental

datasets is very scattered, much more than one would expect in reality. Consequently, the

experimental data are apparently subject to signiﬁcant uncertainties, most likely due to a

combination of statistical and systematic eﬀects. Based on the careful analysis of trends in

BSR-500 dataset (state-to-state transitions between the lowest 31 states plus ionization cross

sections are available on the LXCat database [82]) rather than any of the few experimental

Ionization and Grand Total Cross Section

Figure 7 exhibits results for ionization of the argon in its ground state. Not surprisingly,

a hybrid model [79], in which the projectile is described by a distorted wave, vastly overesti-

mates the cross section for low and intermediate energies. An earlier RMPS calculation [80]

does well up to incident energies of 50 eV, which is the highest energy available from this

work. However, the trend suggests a signiﬁcant increase of the predicted cross section for

higher energies, in likely disagreement with the experimental data. The BSR-500 model

misses (for reasons currently unknown) the rapid increase of the cross section observed in

experiment [77], but agrees very well with both experimental datasets [77, 78] for energies

ILLUSTRATION: ELECTRON COLLISIONS WITH METHANE MOLECULES

Methane, CH4, is a high-symmetry (tetrahedral) 10-electron molecule. It is thus isoelec-

tronic with neon. Song et al. [83] recently completed a comprehensive review and compilation

of electron collision cross sections with methane. It is certainly telling that, with the ex-

ception of electron impact rotational excitations, all their recommended cross sections are

experimental. However, for some processes, notably electron impact electronic excitation

and electron impact dissociation, they were unable to make a ﬁrm recommendation due to

the poor quality of the available data.

Electron scattering from methane shows a number of important features. At low energy

there is a pronounced Ramsauer minimum where the cross sections become close to zero.

There are no low-lying resonances in the system, but dissociative attachment, a process that

occurs exclusively via resonance formation, is observed around 10 eV incident energy [83].

The low-lying electronic excited states of methane are all dissociative, and hence their exci-

tation by electron impact is generally assumed to lead to dissociation [84]. This process is

believed to be important in plasma-assisted combustion.

R-matrix calculations for electron collisions with methane have been performed by a num-

ber of groups [84–88]. The results given below are largely drawn from the study performed

by Brigg et al. [88]. This study aimed to converge the elastic, total, and momentum-transfer

cross sections at low energy, which is the region covering the Ramsauer minimum and, at

the same time, treat the electron impact electronic excitation/dissociation problem.

A. Elastic cross sections

Reproducing the Ramsauer minimum is challenging because it involves cancelation be-

tween the static interactions, which are relatively easy to reproduce, and polarization eﬀects,

which are not. Without a good representation of polarization, therefore, the calculation will

not give satisfactory answers. It is actually reasonably straightforward to do this within an

SEP model [86], but this model cannot treat electronic excitation. Instead, Brigg et al. [88]

tested a large number of CC models to see which one converged their elastic scattering

calculations. Note, however, that they generally investigated eigenphase sums rather than

cross sections to test convergence. They also used the target polarizability given by each

of their models as a proxy for estimating the convergence of their polarization potential.

Brigg et al.’s ﬁnal model contained 999 states, which made the calculations computationally

expensive.

The standard molecular formulation of the RMPS model involves single excitations from

the target wavefunction into a set of pseudo-orbitals [92]. This has proved successful for a

variety of electron-collision problems [37, 93]. However, Brigg et al. found that for methane

the model showed poor convergence and that the use of too large a set of pseudo-states could

4 anion. Instead
they found that it was necessary to use models closer to the multi-reference conﬁguration

interaction (MRCI) treatment of the correlation problem [94], which is frequently employed

by quantum chemists. In this procedure up to three electrons were excited from the target

into the pseudo-states.

Figure 9 compares a range of theoretical predictions of the elastic cross section for electron

CH4 collisions. The agreement between the RMPS/MRCI model of Brigg et al. and the

recommended (experimental) result is good. The SEP calculations [86, 89, 90] also give

reasonable agreement, while the CC-24 [84] and CC-48 [91] calculations do not predict a

Ramsauer minimum. The latter models do not account for coupling to the continuum via

pseudo-states and, therefore, underestimate the polarization eﬀects. Overall the spread of

about 10 % in the values away from the minimum is probably a reasonable estimate of the

uncertainty in the theoretical elastic cross sections. A similar conclusion can be drawn for

the total cross section in the low-energy regime and also for the momentum transfer cross

sections; see Brigg et al. [88].

B. Excitation of nuclear motion

Electrons collisions can excite both rotational and vibrational motion. Although there

has been some work on electron impact vibration excitation [95], Song et al. [83] concluded

that these cross sections remain poorly characterized, a conclusion that is hard to argue

with.

Methane possesses neither a permanent dipole moment nor, uncommon for a molecule,

a permanent quadrupole moment. This means that electron impact rotational excitation

obeys the rather unusual selection rule that ∆J ≥ 3, where J is the rotational quantum

number. The resulting excitation cross sections can be expected to be small and dominated

by short-range interactions. Figure 10 summarizes all currently known calculations for the

total cross section. The agreement between the individual predictions is reasonable, and the

spread of 15 % probably approximates their uncertainty.

21

methane molecule in its electronic ground state. The recent predictions of Brigg et al. [88] are

compared with earlier calculations by Brescansin et al. [96]; and Abusalbi et al. [97].

C. Higher energy processes

At higher collision energies, electron excitation, electron-impact dissociation (which gen-

erally happens via excitation of dissociative electronic states [98]), and ionization become

important. Methane’s low-lying electronic states are largely dissociative, which makes cross

sections for electronic excitation unimportant for plasma studies. Instead these excitations

all contribute to the electron impact dissociation cross section, which remains highly uncer-

tain for methane [83]. The situation is somewhat diﬀerent for electron impact ionization.

Besides the RMPS approach [99], there are a number of methods for treating electron

impact ionization of molecules. These include ECS and TDCC, and indeed ﬁrst-principles

calculations have been performed for electron impact ionization of methane at high ener-

gies [100]. However, experience shows that such calculations are computationally demanding,

particularly in the important intermediate-energy regime up to a few times the ionization

threshold. Conversely, the semi-empirical BEB method is generally found to yield excellent

estimates of the ionization cross section as a function of energy. For plasma applications,

use of the BEB procedure is likely to remain the most practical way for the foreseeable

22

predicting break-up products following ionization.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have presented a brief overview of the time-independent close-coupling method, as it

is applied to calculations of cross sections for electron collisions with atoms and molecules.

The method is based on the (in principle) complete expansion of the total wavefunction

of the (N + 1)-electron collision system in terms of products describing the projectile and

the N -electron target.

In practice, a variety of approximations have to made, including

the description of the target structure, the level at which correlation and relativistic eﬀects

are accounted for, and the way ionization and other rearrangement processes are treated.

Consequently, estimating the reliability of theoretical predictions has become a key aspect of

any work in this ﬁeld [12]. We hope that the present manuscript, together with the references

provided, will be a useful resource for the plasma community to ﬁnd relevant information

when choosing which theoretical data to incorporate in their model applications.

At the present time much more robust results are obtainable for electron collisions with

atomic targets than for molecular ones. Nevertheless, theory is still capable of providing

important results for electron collisions with molecular species [101]. For cases involving

open-shell molecules, in particular, theory remains the only source of such data. The devel-

opments being employed to produce highly reliable electron-atom collisions cross sections,

such as the use of pseudo-states to yield converged calculations and B-spline basis func-

tions to allow for an accurate representation of the continuum channels, are presently being

adopted by groups working on electron-molecule collisions. We expect that these eﬀorts will

lead to further improvement in the results of such calculations.
