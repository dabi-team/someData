Abstract—Liquid-gas 

is  a  common 
two-phase 
occurrence  in  various  industrial  applications.  However,  for 
nuclear  fusion  applications  with  a  Li  based  liquid-breeder, 
existence of two-phase flow may lead to critical issues including 
decreased  Tritium  Breeding  Ratio  (TBR),  generation  of  hot-
spots and improper nuclear shielding. Additionally, a very large 
density  ratio  of  Liquid-Metal  (LM)  to  gas  mandates  relevant 
experimental database towards  development and validation of 
software  tools.  Out  of  the  candidate  liquid-breeders,  lead-
lithium  eutectic  (Pb-16Li)  has  gained  immense  focus  for  its 
various  advantages  and  is  utilized  in  several  breeding-blanket 
concepts.  In  view  of  the  above-mentioned  requirements,  it  is 
imperative that a LM–gas two-phase detection tool be developed 
for high-temperature liquid PbLi environment. For two-phase 
detection in LMs, electrical-conductivity based probes are most 
suitable  in  terms  of  ruggedness,  ease  of  fabrication  and 
simplicity of operation. However, corrosive nature coupled with 
high  operational  temperature  for  PbLi  facilities  puts  severe 
demands  on  electrical-insulation,  a  foremost  requirement  for 
electrical-conductivity based detection schemes. In this study, a 
multivariable  probe  based  on  electrical-conductivity  and 
temperature  measurement  schemes  is  developed  using  an 
electrical-insulation  coating  of  high-purity  alumina  (Al2O3). 
Developed probe is validated in high-temperature PbLi-Ar  two-
phase vertical column with bulk PbLi temperature upto 400°C 
and  time-averaged  void-fraction  upto  0.95  covering  flow 
regimes from dispersed bubbly flow upto in-box Loss of Coolant 
Accident (LOCA) characterized by a very large gas flow inside 
bulk  PbLi.  Developed  probe  provides  high  reliability  with 
excellent 
individual  bubble 
detection  using 
electrical-conductivity  based  principle 
alongwith simultaneous two-phase temperature trends. Present 
paper  provides  details  about  sensor  probe  fabrication  and 
calibration, LM-gas two-phase test-facility, time-averaged void-
fraction estimations using threshold method, bubble-frequency 
and  bubble  residence-time  estimations  alongwith  critical 
observations from the preliminary experimental investigations.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

liquid  breeder  materials 

Nuclear fusion breeder-blanket concepts employ attractive 
solid  and 
form  of 
lithium/lithium-containing compounds like Li, Pb-16Li, Li2O, 
LiAlO2, Li4SiO4, Li2SiO3, Li2TiO3 and Li2ZrO3 [1-2]. Out of 
these  candidate  materials,  Pb-16Li  (hereafter  referred  to  as 
PbLi)  has  gained  immense  focus  for  its  various  advantages 
including  a  high  TBR  without  an  additional  neutron-
multiplier,  circulation  ability  facilitating  tritium  extraction 

the 

in 

and 

safety 

outside  blanket,  immunity  towards  radiation  damage  and 
thermal  stresses,  high  thermal-conductivity  and  reduced 
chemical-activity  compared  to  pure  Li  [2].  Success  of  a 
breeder  concept  is  primarily  governed  by  TBR  and  heat-
extraction  performance,  which  can  be  well  achieved  using 
PbLi in a self-cooled concept. However, interaction of Li with 
fusion neutrons to breed tritium leads to generation of helium 
gas as a by-product, which has a low-solubility in PbLi and 
could  precipitate  in  the  form  of  bubbles  affecting  system 
design 
[3-5].  Entrapped  gases  within 
breeder/coolant  LM  circuit  may  cause  local  hot-spots, 
improper  shielding and a reduction in TBR.  For PbLi flow-
rates upto 1000 kg/s, gas-phase generation is significant and 
independent  of  pressure  [3].  Various  concepts  like  HCLL 
(Helium-cooled  Lithium  Lead),  WCLL 
(Water-cooled 
Lithium  Lead),  DCLL  (Dual  Coolant  Lithium  Lead)  and 
LLCB  (Lead-lithium  Ceramic  Breeder),  therefore,  would 
invariably  be  prone  to  such  a  phenomenon.  In  some  of  the 
concepts (HCLL and LLCB), an in-box Test Blanket Module 
(TBM) LOCA will lead to ingress of high-pressure helium gas 
inside  PbLi  circuit  resulting  in  a  liquid-gas  two-phase  flow 
with  high  density  ratio  between  two-phases.  Preliminary 
experimental  studies  at  Institute  for  Plasma  Research  (IPR) 
with  water  as  a  test-fluid  corroborated  presence  of  trapped 
gas-pockets  at  90°  bends  and  entrained  gas-bubbles  in  re-
circulation  zones 
inside  TBM-like  complex  geometry. 
Similarly,  two-phase  flow  and  trapped  gas-pockets  are  also 
expected  in lab-scale  R&D facilities due to LM  charging in 
presence  of  inert  cover  gas.  To  model  such  occurrences  of 
relevance towards design and operational safety of ancillary 
breeder/coolant  circuits  for  future  fusion  reactors,  extensive 
experimental  database  needs  to  be  generated,  mandating 
development of proper diagnostic tools compatible with high-
temperature  and  corrosive  PbLi  environment.  Numerous 
experimental  studies  for  room  temperature  and  low-melting 
LMs  have  been  conducted  worldwide  utilizing  commercial 
and specialized techniques [6-12] like PIV, laser, γ-ray, X-ray, 
neutron emission etc. Although such techniques benefit from 
non-intrusive nature of detection [13-14], the opaque nature, 
extreme  operating  environments,  installation  constraints, 
requirements  of  localized  detections  and  high-attenuation 
characteristics  of  LM  render  most  of 
techniques 
challenging 
implementation.  As  a 
preliminary  attempt  to  study  two-phase  flow  regimes, 
electrical-impedance  based  techniques  offer  a  better  route 
considering ease of installation, feasibility of adaptation and 
good  response  owing  to  large  difference  in  electrical-
conductivities of LM and gas. A detailed two-phase study on

PbBi eutectic utilizing electrical-conductivity probe has been 
conducted  upto  a  temperature  of  200°C  [15].  However, 
adaptation  to  PbLi  puts  severe  demands  on  electrical-
insulation  compatibility 
towards  corrosive  media  and 
operational  temperature  upto  400°C.  Considering  such 
limitations  and  unavailability  of  experimental  data,  studies 
have  been  recently  initiated  with  numerical  tools  to  predict 
different two-phase flow regimes in PbLi environment [16]. 
As stated in recent literature [16] and to the best knowledge of 
authors,  no  experimental  data  exists  on  two-phase  flow 
detection  for  PbLi.  This  study  primarily  aims  to  bridge  the 
existing gap with development and preliminary validation of 
a measurement tool to study two-phase flow regimes in PbLi 
environment. In this work, gas-phase detection in bubbly flow 
regime  with  estimations  of  time-averaged  void-fraction  (α) 
has  been  performed  for  bulk  temperature  upto  400°C. 
Validation  of  measurement  technique  is  further  extended 
towards  accidental  scenarios  like  in-box  LOCA  simulated 
with  controlled  Ar  gas  injection  at  high  flow-rates  varying 
from 1.5 slpm to 3.5 slpm in vertical PbLi column.  

II.  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

A.  Probe Design 

junctions 

located  1.5  mm  from  sheath 

The multivariable probe is fabricated from a  specifically 
designed  and  calibrated  duplex  configuration  K-type 
thermocouple  with  outer  sheath  of  1.5  mm  diameter  and 
sensing 
tip. 
Ungrounded  hot-junction  configuration  allows  utilization  of 
single  probe  for  simultaneous  electrical-conductivity  based 
measurements  and  bulk-temperature  measurements.  Dip-
coating technique is applied, on the probe-sheath except the 
tip, to coat a thin layer of AlPO4-bonded calcined Al2O3 with 
99.8% purity (characterized as pure α-Al2O3 phase) available 
as refractory coating suspension. Probe-sheath is then inserted 
into a recrystallized alumina tube (200 mm length, 2 mm bore 
and 1 mm wall thickness) intended to provide protection and 
ruggedness against impacts from  Ar  bubbles rising in  high-
density LM column. End of the tube (near sensor-tip) is closed 
by  filling  same  coating  suspension,  such  that  ~1.5  mm  of 
thermocouple sheath is uncoated (exposed). After a 24 h air-
set period, heat-cure  performed  in a muffle furnace, at each 
coating stage, includes following steps:     

•  Gradual 

dehydration:  Ramp-up 

room 
temperature (RT) to 93°C over 2 h followed by heat-
cure at 93°C for 2 h.  

from 

•  Bonding  to  substrate:  Ramp-up  from  93°C  to  427°C 
over 12 h followed by heat-cure at 427°C for 2 h.   

•  Natural cool-down from 427°C to RT. 

After first heat-cure, annular region between sensor sheath 
and  tube  wall  is  filled  with  coat  suspension  using  a 
hypodermic  needle  and  second  heat-cure  is  performed. 
Closure of tube rear-end with application of coating over outer 
surface on 100 mm of the tube-length followed by third heat-
cure  completes  probe  fabrication.  Relevant  section  of    final 
fabricated probe is shown in Fig. 1. Working principle for the 
probe is  similar  to  that  described  under [17]  except  that  the 
second  electrode  is  replaced  by  another  duplex  K-type 
thermocouple,  which  also  measures  bulk  PbLi  temperature. 
Therefore, fabricated probe provides thermal trends for two-
phase flow in addition to discrete voltage dips corresponding 
to  bubble  interactions  with  exposed  metallic-tip.  Average 
diameter of as-fabricated probe is ~ 4.6 mm corresponding to 

coating  thickness  ~300  µm.  Insulation  leakage  current  (IL) 
was < 1 nA at RT with a test voltage of 275 VDC (IR tester 
Make:  Fluke;  Model:  1550C).  In  addition  to  facilitating 
installation of probe in test tank, utilized compression fittings 
provide  gas-tight  seal  to  maintain  inert  environment  and 
minimize probe movement during bubble impaction. 

B.  Test-Facility: Design and Operation 

Fig.  2(a)  represents  schematic  of  designed  test-facility 
(without  PbLi  tank)  highlighting  PbLi  wetted  components. 
Assembled test set-up is shown in Fig. 2(b). Thermal gradients 
within bulk PbLi are minimized using diameter and height of 
the tank as 52.48 mm and 100 mm respectively. PbLi wetted 
components of facility are fabricated of SS-304 while probe-
sheath  is  made  of  SS-316.  Melting  of  PbLi  chunks  and 
thereafter  temperature  regulation  is  achieved  within  ±  5°C 
using  feedback  temperature  control  based  resistive  surface 
heating.  A  constant  inert  cover  environment  is  maintained 
with positive Ar pressure and repeated Ar flushing. A separate 
bare-sheathed thermocouple dipped inside bulk PbLi acts as 
reference  electrode  for  electrical-conductivity  based  circuit 
while also providing bulk PbLi temperature before generation 
of two-phase flow. Bubble interaction probability with probe 
sensing-tip  is  increased  by  means  of  Ar-gas  injection  using 
specially designed 8-legged spider configuration sparger with 
three  bores  of  2  mm  in  each  leg.  During  continuous  Ar 
injection, momentary closure of vent valve with simultaneous 
rise  in  system  pressure  ensures  gas  flow  in  facility. 
Subsequent to achieving steady Ar flow, sparger is inserted in 
PbLi till tank bottom, from where the Ar gas injected nearly 
at  RT  and  after  traversing  through  complete  axial  length  of 
sparger,  emerges  at  the  bottom  of  molten  PbLi  column  and 
rises  upwards  generating  a  two-phase  flow-regime.  After 
stabilization, hybrid probe is inserted and contact with PbLi is 
real-time  voltage  measurements  and 
ensured  using 
simultaneous  rise  of  both  the  temperature  signals  of  the 
multivariable probe. At low injection flow-rates, variation in 
Ar 
is  achieved  using  a  manual  needle-valve 
downstream of Ar gas cylinder. At higher flow-rates, a Digital 
Mass  Flow  Controller  (DMFC)  is  employed  to  realize  α 
similar  to  in-box  LOCA  accidental  conditions.  Distance 
between the probe-tip and top layer of sparger legs is ~55 mm.

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

A.  Calibration and Response-Time Estimations 

Probe  calibration  is  performed  using  manual  dip  and 
retrieval cycles in static PbLi at bulk temperature of 290°C. 
High electrical conductivity of PbLi [18-19] generated pulsed 
voltage output nearly equal to the excitation voltage of 5 VDC. 
Sampling of thermocouple raw-signals (mV) was performed 
synchronous  to  conductivity-circuit  voltage  signal  while 
offline  temperature  conversion  is  performed  using  constant 
Seebeck coefficient of 40µV/°C as applicable in the operating 
range  of  interest.  Error  minimization  for  cold-junction 
compensation  is  achieved  using  ambient  control  at  Data-
Acquisition  (DAQ).  Utilized  PXIe-6363  module,  with  an 
absolute accuracy of ≤33 µV, provides an absolute error less 
than  ± 1°C.  Further  processing  for  temperature  trends 
involves  smoothening  using  a  moving-average  function  for 
last 250 samples. A representative calibration data logged at 
0.2 kHz sampling frequency is shown in Fig. 3. From t = 0 to 
5.63s, probe is outside PbLi and shows a zero-voltage output 
due to open circuit condition. As soon as the probe is dipped 
in  PbLi  (t  =  5.63s),  pulsed  output  of  ~5V  is  obtained  and 

 
simultaneous  sharp  positive  slope  is  observed  for  both 
temperature trends leading towards bulk PbLi temperature. It 
should be noted that rise in temperature  between t = 0 to 5.63s 
is the effect of probe travel towards PbLi before immersion. 
At t = 48.45s, probe is pulled out of PbLi leading to a zero 
voltage  corresponding 
in  continuity  with 
to  break 
simultaneous decreasing trend in both temperature values. The 
time-duration from t = 48.45s to 77.68s simulates a plug flow 
trend  (not  to  scale).  Similar  pattern  is  repeated  for  probe 
insertion at t = 77.68s and retrieval at t = 92.62s. Similarity of 
temperature  trends  corroborates  accuracy  of  measurements 
from both junctions of multivariable probe. From t = 106.89s 
to t = 115.66s, output response towards repeated dip/retrieve 
cycles  with  approximately  1s  dip-time,  highlights  excellent 
response  of  the  electrical-conductivity  based  measurements 
but  sluggish  response  on  part  of  temperature  signals. 
However,  detailed  observation  suggests  magnitude  of 
temperature  during  this  period,  i.e.  ~283°C,  remains  in-
between  the  temperature  magnitudes  when  probe-tip  is  in 
liquid-phase  (~289°C)  and  when  probe-tip  is  in  gas-phase 
(~276°C). Detailed analysis of interpolated voltage signal for 
one of the immersion/retrieval cycles, shown in Fig. 4(a) and 
(b), establishes T90 response-time of ~4.9 ms for rising voltage 
(immersion  in  PbLi)  and  ~4.5  ms  for  dropping  voltage 
(retrieval from PbLi) i.e.  simulating bubble impaction using 
electrical-conductivity  principle.  Finite  rise-time  and  drop-
time arise for voltage signal due to entrained gas-volume near 
the  sensing-tip  during  sudden  immersion  and  adhered  thin-
film  of  PbLi  during  retrieval,  respectively  [20].  Although, 
previous  work  has  demonstrated  clear  dependance  of 
calibration and response-time on sampling-frequency [17], a 
relatively lower sampling at 0.2 kHz suffices for conclusive 
and  qualitative  real-time  detection  in  this  case  considering 
high electrical-conductivity of PbLi compared to water. 

B.  Criterion for Conclusive Detection 

Assuming  the  case  of  an  irregular  shaped  single  bubble 
with impaction-chord length = l + d, as shown in Fig. 5 (where 

l = length of conducting-tip of probe) rising vertically in PbLi 
column  with  velocity  v.  As  discussed  in  [17],  voltage  dip 
initiates after complete encapsulation of conducting-tip (AB) 
by  the  bubble  and  voltage  rise  will  commence  as  soon  as 
length d has been traversed across point B. In limiting case, 
where the time taken to traverse d exactly equals T90 response-
time for voltage dip case, conclusive bubble detection based 
on T90 response is given by: 

                                        𝑑 = 𝑣𝑇  

() 

Therefore,  with  a  sensing-tip  of  1.5  mm,  bubbles  with 
impaction-chord  lengths  of  1.6  mm  and  2  mm  could  be 
detected conclusively using T90 threshold, if traversing  probe-
tip at velocities upto 2.22 cm/s and 11.11 cm/s, respectively.

Further  performance  enhancements  are  possible  with 
length reduction and use of needle-shaped tip to detect smaller 
bubbles with higher velocities. A relaxation in threshold limit 
(eg:  T50  or  T75  instead  of  T90)  will  also  allow  detection  of 
similar sized bubbles with higher velocities.  

C.  Probe Performance at Low and Intermediate α 

trends 

(Fig.6(a)-(i)).  Considering 

Fabricated  probe  was  exposed  to  PbLi-Ar  two-phase 
vertical  column  with  bulk  PbLi  temperature  of  390°C  and 
varying α. Obtained voltage pulses are normalized in binary, 
with logic HIGH (1) assigned to samples having magnitude 
≥ 80% of maximum output while logic LOW (0) assigned to 
remaining samples. Ratio of number of logic LOW samples to 
the total number of samples defines α for time-interval under 
consideration. Performance data for a continuous run of 20s (t 
=  0  to  20s),  extracted  from  an  experimental  run  of  200s 
duration, is presented in the form of simultaneous voltage and 
temperature 
close 
agreement in redundant temperature trends from multivariable 
probe, trend for only one junction is shown and discussed as 
representative case. For ease of comparison, ordinate range is 
kept as 30°C and abscissa range as 2.5s with α mentioned at 
top-left corner. The first observation that  Fig. 6(a)-(i) depict 
characteristics  of  bubbly  flow  occasionally  tending  towards 
slug flow [16, 21-22] without a clear distinction, is in close 
agreement  to  experimental  observations  from  [9],  where  no 
stable slug bubbles could be identified in PbBi-N2 flow owing 
to  high  shearing  stress  of  LM  flow  induced  by  preceding 
bubbles.  Fig.  6(i),  extracted  from  same  experimental  run, 
depicts arrested gas-flow from the sparger with probe dipped 
in  PbLi  environment  continuously.  Fig.  7,  derived  from 
another  experimental  run,  provides  insights  about  PbLi-Ar 
flow at very low α (≠0) giving stark characteristics of well-
dispersed Ar bubbles of varying diameters in PbLi continuum. 
two-phase  bulk 
Variation 
temperature  using  multivariable  probe  is  observed  to  be 
inversely  dependent  on  α,  attributed  to  a  coupled  effect  of 
forced convection and simultaneous decrease in the effective 
thermal  conductivity  of  the  two-phase  mixture  leading  to  a 
reduced heat-extraction from the tank walls. Obtained voltage 
data in agreement with temperature trends establishes reliable 
detection using fabricated probe.  Restricted Ar flow (α =0 and 
0.02), represented in Fig. 6(i) and Fig. 7, rapidly drives two-
phase temperature towards bulk PbLi temperature. Although 
each  bubble  could  be  detected  using  electrical-conductivity 
principle, only a trend could be established through two-phase 
temperature  measurements  providing  qualitative  inference. 
Further  adaptation  of  measurement  probe  is  foreseen  using 
micro-thermocouples  with  better  response  to  quantify  two-
phase regime using temperature data alone.

D.  Bubble-Frequency and Average Bubble Residence-Time  
A single-tip probe could not provide information related to 
bubble velocity or impaction-chord in absence of a reference 
time  frame.  However,  bubble-frequency  (fb),  defined  as  the 
ratio  of  number  of  bubbles  (N)  impacting  the  probe  to  the 
given time duration (T), could be estimated [23] as follows: 

                                    𝑓b = 𝑁/𝑇 

      (2) 

       fb  can  be  further  utilized  to  estimate  average  bubble 
residence-time (Tb), defined as average time a bubble takes to 
traverse through probe-tip [23], as follows: 

                                     𝑇b = 𝛼/𝑓b    

                     (3) 

Considering cases from Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(d) with nearly 
same  α,  estimated  fb  are  4  bubble/s  and  6  bubble/s, 
respectively.  Such  a  difference  could  be  explained  by 
observation  of  unequal  void  distribution  over  2.5s  duration. 
Moreover, in a dispersed bubbly-flow regime, fb is expected to 
increase with an increase in α. However, high-surface tension 
of  LMs  leads  to  coalescence  of  bubbles  resulting  in  gas-
pockets  with  larger  impaction-chords  effectively  reducing 
bubble  count  even  with  higher  magnitude  of  α,  as  clearly 
observed for Fig. 6(h) with an estimated fb = 4.4 bubble/s. For 
the cases of Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(d) with similar α, estimated 
Tb  are  ~118.75  ms  and  79.5  ms,  respectively,  which  also 
corroborates  that  even  within  similar  α  regimes,  time-
distribution  of  interaction  of  liquid  and  gas  phases  with  the 
probe-tip varies significantly. For higher α case in Fig. 6(h),  
Tb  =  140.45  ms  depicts  the  effect  of  bubble  coalescence  in 
accordance  to  the  arguments  made  above.  At  very  low  α 
(Fig.7)  regimes,  estimated  parameters  of  0.6  bubble/s  and 
38.33 ms highlight a dispersed bubbly flow regime. 

E.  Probe Performance at High α (In-box LOCA) 

In-box  LOCA  is one  of the  postulated accidental  events 
where high-pressure secondary coolant (He/H2O) enters PbLi 
loop  pressurizing  the  complete  PbLi  system.  A  recent 
simulation  study  for  PbLi-He  two-phase  flow  [16]  has 
considered  α  in  the  range of 0.1-0.9  with mixture velocities 
from 0.0001 m/s to 100 m/s in rectangular duct geometries of 
varying widths. In the present experimental study, controlled 
Ar  flow  varying  from  1.5-3.5  slpm,  corresponding  to 
superficial gas velocities (Vg) from 0.0115 m/s to 0.0269 m/s 
(at standard conditions), has been injected using a DMFC to 
achieve α  ~ 0.95 over  continuous durations  as long  as 200s 
within  bulk  PbLi  temperature  of  400°C.  Fig.  8  represents  a 
sample of 10s corresponding to Vg = 0.0192 m/s. Flow-pattern 
inferred  from  pulsed  voltage  output  clearly  establishes 
localized two-phase regime tending towards an annular flow 
with fb = 1.3 bubble/s and Tb  = 726.92 ms. In contrast to bubbly 
flow, high Tb is indicative of dispersed PbLi phase within Ar 
gas continuum near the probe-tip. This observation is also in 
agreement  with  the  annular  flows  reported  under  [16]  at 
relevant  α.  The  average 
temperature  measured  by 
multivariable probe and PbLi bulk temperature sensor over the 
presented 
to 
corresponding averages over complete test-duration of 250s, 
justifying  the  analysed  sample  being  representative  case. 
Continuous exposure duration of the fabricated probe in high 
α  (>  0.9)  PbLi-Ar  environment  was  over  2h.  No  signal 
distortions related to coating degradation were observed [24] 
and insulation integrity was corroborated with IL < 1nA at 275 
VDC  post-exposure.  During  the  preliminary  investigations, 
probe was exposed to temperature gradients ~ 300°C within a 
few seconds (during immersion) and pressure gradients upto 
1  bar(g)  during  sparger  tests.  No  adverse  effects  of  such 
gradients were observed. Image of the probe after retrieval is 
shown  in  Fig.  9.  The  silvery  lustrous  PbLi  deposited  on 

time  duration  matches  within  ±1°C

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 

employing 

simultaneous  bulk 

      A  multivariable  probe  based  on  electrical-conductivity 
principle 
temperature 
measurements was fabricated, using high-purity electrically 
insulating  Al2O3  coating,  to  experimentally  study  PbLi-Ar 
two-phase  flow  with  bulk 
temperature  upto  400°C. 
Developed probe was calibrated and validated under different 
flow  regimes  like  single-phase,  bubbly  flow,  transition  and 
localized  annular  flows  with  void-fractions  upto  0.95. 
Conclusive  bubble  detection  criterion  was  discussed  to 
correlate  bubble-velocity  and  impaction-chord  length  for  a 
given 
threshold.  Electrical-conductivity  based  scheme 
provides  reliable  and  quantitative  detection  while  coherent 
temperature  trends  provide  qualitative  insights  relevant  to 
existing flow regime. Bubble-frequency and average bubble 
residence-time  were  calculated  from  the  measured  data. 
Experimental  observations  suggest  increase  in  gas-phase 
fraction (α > 0.6) may result in coalescence of smaller bubble 
pockets  leading  to  an  increased  bubble  residence-time.  In 
contrast  to  water-air  flows,  present  study  corroborates 
absence of stable slug bubbles, ascribed to shearing stresses 
generated by induced liquid-metal flow. A clear demarcation 
of  flow  regime  requires  fully  developed  flow,  which  was 
limited in the present study.  To minimize  effects related to 
probe-bubble interactions (like flow-geometry modification, 
bubble  dynamics,  etc.),  miniaturization  is  envisaged  using 
fine-diameter  thermocouples.  Although  time-averaged  α  is 
relevant  to  study  localized  phenomena,  ability  to  measure 
area-averaged void-fractions is of extreme importance. In this 
view, a sensor-array is planned for implementation in PbLi-
Ar/He vertical columns. Developed probe is expected to be 
an indispensable tool enabling experimental studies at high-
temperature providing substantiation for software tools under 
development towards predicting postulated events in a TBM 
and/or  fusion  machine  employing  advanced  liquid-metal 
based breeding-blanket concepts.
