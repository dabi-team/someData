ABSTRACT

The thermonuclear explosion of massive white dwarfs is believed to explain at least a fraction of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). After
thermal runaway, electron captures on the ashes left behind by the burning front determine a loss of pressure, which impacts the
dynamics of the explosion and the neutron excess of matter. Indeed, overproduction of neutron-rich species such as 54Cr has been
deemed a problem of Chandrasekhar-mass models of SNIa for a long time. I present the results of a sensitivity study of SNIa models
to the rates of weak interactions, which have been incorporated directly into the hydrodynamic explosion code. The weak rates have
been scaled up/down by a factor ten, either globally for a common bibliographical source, or individually for selected isotopes. In
line with previous works, the impact of weak rates uncertainties on sub-Chandrasekhar models of SNIa is almost negligible. The
impact on the dynamics of Chandrasekhar-mass models and on the yield of 56Ni is also scarce. The strongest eﬀect is found on the
nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich nuclei, such as 48Ca, 54Cr, 58Fe, and 64Ni. The species with the highest inﬂuence on nucleosynthesis
do not coincide with the isotopes that contribute most to the neutronization of matter. Among the last ones, there are protons, 54,55Fe,
55Co, and 56Ni, while the main inﬂuencers are 54,55Mn and 55−57Fe, in disagreement with Parikh et al (2013), who found that SNIa
nucleosynthesis is most sensitive to the β+-decay rates of 28Si, 32S, and 36Ar. An eventual increase in all weak rates on pf-shell nuclei
would aﬀect the dynamical evolution of hot bubbles, running away at the beginning of the explosion, and the yields of SNIa.

1. Introduction

Weak interactions on iron-group nuclei (IGN) play a key role in
the late stages of stellar evolution. In type II supernovae, ﬁrst
electron captures in the iron core reduce the pressure and start
the collapse and, later, beta-decays on neutron-rich nuclei con-
tribute appreciably to the neutrino ﬂux, help to regulate the core
temperature (Aufderheide et al. 1990), and leave an imprint on
the nucleosynthetic yield of the innermost ejected shells (Lan-
ganke et al. 2011). Aufderheide et al. (1994) studied the most
relevant electron captures in the pre-supernova evolution of mas-
sive stars, and identiﬁed many iron-group nuclei that may have
an inﬂuence on the conditions at supernova core collapse. These
nuclei were subsequently targets of theoretical studies to reﬁne
the associated weak rates. As another example, electron capture
supernovae (see Gil-Pons et al. 2018, for a recent review) are
predicted to be triggered by the transmutation of the late nucle-
osinthetic products of the most massive intermediate-mass stars
with low metallicity progenitors (Miyaji et al. 1980).

The relevance of weak interactions for Type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) depends on the progenitor system. Nowadays, there is
debate about the nature of SNIa progenitors, whether they are
more or less massive white dwarfs (WD), and whether they are
part of a single degenerate or a double degenerate binary sys-
tem. While all of these scenarios have several points in favour
and against (Chomiuk et al. 2012; Jacobson-Galán et al. 2018;
Kilpatrick et al. 2018; Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2019, and refer-
ences therein), there are indications that SNIa may be produced
by a combination of all of them (e.g. Sasdelli et al. 2017; Liu
et al. 2018). In SNIa triggered by the explosion of massive WDs,
ﬁrst, during the pre-supernova carbon simmering phase, elec-
tron captures and beta decays drive the equilibrium conﬁgura-

tion of the star in response to mass accretion from a companion
star and, later, electron captures destabilize the WD and start
the dynamical phase of the explosion (e.g. Yokoi et al. 1979;
Chamulak et al. 2008; Piersanti et al. 2017). Early during the ex-
plosion, electron captures on IGN reduce the electron pressure
and aﬀect the dynamical evolution and the nucleosynthesis of
SNIa. On the other hand, SNIa coming from the explosion of
sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs (Woosley & Weaver 1994; Fink
et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2018) are not expected to be aﬀected by
either electron captures o beta-decays during the pre-explosive
or explosive phases. However, explosion of WDs more massive
than ∼ 1 M(cid:12) may drive the central regions to densities and tem-
peratures high enough that the electron mole number changes
signiﬁcantly.

The sensitivity of SNIa nucleosynthesis to the weak rates
adopted in their modelling has been analysed in a few works,
with conﬂicting results. Brachwitz et al. (2000) probed the con-
sequences of a global change in the stellar weak rates of IGN
owing to new shell model calculations of the Gamow-Teller
(GT+) strength distribution of pf-shell nuclei (Dean et al. 1998).
These authors found a systematic shift in the centroid of the
GT+ strength distribution and lower stellar weak rates than
prior models. They explored the thermonuclear explosions of
Chandrasekhar-mass WDs with central densities in the range
(1.7 − 2.1) × 109 g cm−3, applying approximate factors to cor-
rect for the GT+ centroid oﬀset in those nuclei for which the
shell model was not available. The new rates improve the nucle-
osynthesis, reducing the historical excess production of several
neutron-rich isotopes of chromium, titanium, iron, and nickel,
among others, in SNIa models. They noticed that protons dom-
inate the neutronization during SNIa explosions and, since their
weak rate is not aﬀected by the uncertainties plaguing electron

capture rates on IGN, the overall neutronization only depends
weakly on these uncertainties. They also identiﬁed odd-A and
odd-odd nuclei as the largest contributors to the WD neutroniza-
tion, besides protons.

On the other hand, Parikh et al. (2013) analysed one three-
dimensional model of SNIa and the classical one-dimensional
W7 model (Thielemann et al. 1986), and found maximal sensi-
tivity of SNIa nucleosynthesis to the electron capture rates of the
α elements 28Si, 32S, and 36Ar, whereas electron captures on IGN
had little impact on the explosion. Recently, Mori et al. (2016)
have studied the impact that recent alternatives to the shell model
calculations of Dean et al. (1998), motivated by new experimen-
tal data on the electron capture rates on 56Ni and 55Co, have on
SNIa nucleosynthesis. These data call for diﬀerences in the GT+
strength distribution, leading to reduced electron capture rates.
Mori et al. (2016) found that the overall yields of the explosion
are aﬀected at most by 2−3%. Both Mori et al. (2016) and Parikh
et al. (2013) based their sensitivity study on modifying the nu-
clear rates in nuclear post-processing, meaning that the sensitiv-
ity study was decoupled from the supernova hydrodynamics.

In the present work, I explore the sensitivity of SNIa hy-
drodynamics and nucleosynthesis to the rates of weak interac-
tions during the dynamic phase of the explosion, using a one-
dimensional hydrocode with a large nuclear network that makes
unnecessary to post-process the thermodynamic trajectories to
obtain the nucleosynthesis. The hydrodynamic model is run for
each modiﬁcation of a weak rate, thus making the calculation
of the hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis consistent. I explore
a range of WD central density and mass, and modify the weak
rates globally, according to their bibliographic source, and indi-
vidually for the isotopes that contribute most to the neutroniza-
tion of the ejected matter.

2. Explosion models

I have computed SNIa explosion models in spherical symmetry
starting from sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh) and Chandrasekhar-
mass (MCh) WDs. The hydrocode integrates simultaneously the
hydrodynamics and the nuclear network, and has been described
in detail by Bravo et al. (2019). Here, I focus on the behaviour
of models suitable for normal-luminosity SNIa, characterized by
an ejected mass of 56Ni of the order of M(56Ni) ∼ 0.5 − 0.7 M(cid:12).
To this end, I have selected two base models, one describ-
ing the central detonation (DETO) of a sub-MCh WD of mass
MWD = 1.06 M(cid:12), and the other belonging to the delayed det-
onation (DDT) of a MCh WD with central density in the range
ρc = (2−5)×109 g cm−3, thus extending the range of ρc explored
by Brachwitz et al. (2000). The delayed detonation model is
characterized by two parameters, the density of transition, ρDDT,
from a deﬂagration (subsonic ﬂame propagation near the center
of the WD) to a detonation (supersonic combustion wave), and
the velocity of the ﬂame during the deﬂagration phase, vdef, usu-
ally prescribed as a fraction of the local sound velocity, vsound.
The conﬁguration parameters are given in Table 1 together with
the main explosion properties: kinetic energy, K, and M(56Ni).
Models S, S+, C3, C3_1p2, and C3_4p0 in Table 1 are the
same as models 1p06_Z9e-3_std, 1p15_Z9e-3_std, ddt2p4_Z9e-
3_std, ddt1p2_Z9e-3_std, and ddt4p0_Z9e-3_std in Bravo et al.
(2019), and all the details of the code and the models are the
same as in that paper unless otherwise stated in what follows.
The remaining models reported in this work share the same ini-
tial composition as C3 and use the same set of thermonuclear
reaction rates. I have explored the impact of diﬀerent weak rates
for various parameters of the DDT and for diﬀerent initial central

densities, but most of the simulations are variations of model C3.
Its central density at thermal runaway, ρc = 3×109 g cm−3, is that
suggested by some recent studies of the carbon simmering phase
(Martínez-Rodríguez et al. 2016; Piersanti et al. 2017). A central
density as high as ρc = 5 × 109 g cm−3, or even higher, has been
invoked to explain the composition of particular SNIa events
(Dave et al. 2017), while a value as low as ρc = 2 × 109 g cm−3
provides the best nucleosynthetic match with the Solar System
ratios of the IGN (Brachwitz et al. 2000; Mori et al. 2016).

All models in Table 1 share the same set of weak reaction
rates, the results of their modiﬁcation are given later. Next, I ex-
plain the details of the weak rates incorporated to the models.

2.1. Weak rates

(cid:105)
(ρ6Ye)1/3 − 1

At the high densities characteristic of the central layers of ex-
ploding WDs, electron captures are favoured relative to β+ de-
cays because the Fermi-Dirac distribution of degenerate elec-
trons allows an enhancement
in the electron capture rate,
whereas β+ decays remain insensitive to the density (Sarriguren
2016). The Fermi energy of the electrons depends on density as
EF (cid:39) me
with an accuracy better than 98% for
ρ6 > 103, where ρ6 is the density in units of 106 g cm−3, Ye is
the electron mole number in mol g−1, and me = 0.511 MeV is
the mass of the electron in energy units. In SNIa, most of the
neutronization takes place on matter that is in a nuclear statis-
tical equilibrium (NSE) state, at temperatures of the order of
T ∼ 9 × 109 K, where the Fermi energy of the electrons is
EF ∼ 3.5 − 8 MeV.

Stellar electron capture rates are dominated by allowed GT+
transitions, which allow a change of the nuclear angular momen-
tum from parent to child nuclei by ∆J = 0, ±1. Theory and ex-
periment on ground state GT distribution agree, generally, within
a factor ∼ 2 (Wiescher et al. 2012), but when the electron chem-
ical potential (close to the electron Fermi energy) is similar to
the reaction Q-value, the rates are sensitive to the detailed GT+
distribution, and such distributions cannot be measured from ex-
cited states. In theoretical models, the transitions starting from
excited states are treated according to the Brink (or Brink-Axel)
hypothesis: the GT+ strength distribution from excited states is
the same as from the ground state, shifted by the energy of the
excited state. However, the applicability of the Brink hypothe-

sis to excited states with low excitation energy is uncertain (e.g.
Misch et al. 2014).

Fuller et al. (1980, 1982a,b) calculated weak interaction rates
for nuclei in the mass range A = 21 − 60 in the IPM approx-
imation (independent-particle model), but the shell model was
applied only to sd-shell nuclei (A = 17 − 40). Later, Oda et al.
(1994) revised the rates on sd-shell nuclei including new relevant
experimental information. Dean et al. (1998) applied the shell
model to the pf-shell nuclei with experimental data on the GT+
strength distribution: 51V, 55Mn, 54,56Fe, 59Co, and 58,60,62,64Ni,
most of these even-even nuclei, and predicted the stellar weak
rates for other nuclei belonging to the iron group. Cole et al.
(2012) analysed new experimental data on the GT+ strength dis-
tribution on pf-shell nuclei, including those already considered
by Dean et al. (1998) plus: 45Sc, 48Ti, 50V, and 64Zn. Cole et al.
(2012) found that the experimental electron captures rates on
54,56Fe were higher than the theoretical rates (Caurier et al. 1999;
Langanke & Martínez-Pinedo 2000, 2001) by as much as a fac-
tor two in the conditions of SNIa. Fantina et al. (2012) analysed
the same two isotopes of iron from a purely theoretical point of
view, taking into account the uncertainties associated with the
diﬀerent nuclear model parameters, and concluded that the weak
rates on these nuclei could change by as much as two orders of
magnitude for the whole set of parameters explored. Sarriguren
(2013, 2016) revisited the eﬀect of excited states of iron-group
nuclei and concluded that thermal excitation of nuclei in SNIa
can lead to overall electron capture rates higher as well as lower
than those accounting only for transitions from the parent ground
state. In either case, the associated uncertainty is similar to that
derived from nuclear structure.

In all the models presented in this work, weak interaction
rates are adopted from, in order of precedence, Martínez-Pinedo
et al. (2000, hereafter, MPLD00), Oda et al. (1994, hereafter,
Oda94), Pruet & Fuller (2003, hereafter, PF03), and Fuller et al.
(1982b, hereafter, FFN82). For instance, if a rate appears both
in MPLD00 and in FFN82, the former is the choice. The tables
are interpolated following the procedure described in Fuller et al.
(1985). Figure 1 shows the sources of each weak rate in the pro-
ton number vs baryon number plane.

Table 2 gives the overall change in Ye as a result of electron
captures and β+ decays, on the one hand, and of β− decays, on
the other hand, for the sub-MCh models and for the MCh mod-
els with diﬀerent initial central densities. Table 2 also lists the
species that contribute most to the change of Ye in each model
(from here on, the neutronizers). As expected, β− decay contri-
bution is negligible in all SNIa models. The two sub-MCh models
experience a small change of the electron mole number, in spite

of their relatively high mass (for a sub-MCh model). The main
neutronizers in the two models are 60Zn and 56Ni, and protons as
well in the S+ model.

In all MCh models, protons are the main source of neutroniza-
tion, followed by several isotopes from the IGN, among which
there are even-even, odd-odd, and odd-A nuclei. At the lowest
ρc explored, the strongest neutronization is provided, besides
protons, by 55Co and 56Ni, while, for increasing ρc, these two
species are overtaken by the two iron isotopes 54,55Fe. Among
the IGN reported in Table 2, the only rates with direct experi-
mental information about the GT+ distribution are 55Mn, 54,56Fe,
and 58,60Ni.

3. Three-dimensional effects

In three-dimensional models of the thermonuclear explosion of
massive WDs, thermal runaway is usually assumed to start in
discrete volumes located slightly oﬀ-center (bubbles). These
bubbles tend to ﬂoat owing to the expansion caused by the re-
lease of nuclear energy, and their density drops oﬀ sooner than

page 3 of 8

A&A proofs

of complex three-dimensional simulations. However, with in-
creased weak rates the bubble remains near the center, at high
density, for nearly a second. This shows that the weak rates have
the potential of changing the overall dynamical evolution of MCh
models.

4. Sensitivity of nucleosynthesis to the electron

capture rates

In this section, I give the results of the sensitivity of the nucle-
osynthetic yields of the models to the modiﬁcation of weak rates
both globally, applying the same change to all rates coming from
a given source (Sect. 4.1), and individually for selected nuclei
(Sect. 4.2). In the last case, the sensitivity is measured by the
logarithmic derivative, Di, j, of the mass ejected of nucleus i with
respect to the enhancement factor of the weak rates on species
j, f j, which is the factor by which these weak rates are scaled at
every density and temperature:
(cid:32) mi,10
Di, j = d log mi
mi,0.1
d log f j

≈ 0.5 log

(3)

(cid:33)

,

where mi,10 is the mass of nucleus i ejected for f j = 10, and mi,0.1
is the corresponding mass when f j = 0.1. Just to give a feeling
of the meaning of Di, j, a value of Di, j ≈ 0.3 means that the abun-
dance of nucleus i doubles for a constant enhancement factor of
f j = 10. For the same enhancement factor, a value of Di, j ≈ 0.05
implies a relative change in the abundance of a nucleus by 12%,
and a change of 2% would derive from Di, j ≈ 0.01.

All the sensitivity results are based on the computation of ex-
plosion models with individual or global changes in weak rates
by factors of either f j = 10 or f j = 0.1. According to the dis-
cussion in Sect. 2.1, it is expected that the weak rates are known
with better accuracy, of the order of a factor two. However, as
most of the neutronizers weak rates are not tied by direct exper-
imental results, I explore a slightly larger enhancement factor.

4.1. Modiﬁcation of rates by sources

Table 3 shows the results of the models in Table 1 when all the
weak rates tabulated in a given reference are scaled simultane-
ously by the same factor. In general, the sensitivity to an increase
in the weak rates by a factor 10 is much larger than the sensitivity
to a decrease in the rates by the same factor. The only exception
is the decrease in the rates from MPLD00, including the rates on
protons, in model C3, which causes a 10% increase in the yield
of 56Ni and a decrease in the yield of several neutron-rich nuclei,
such as that of 54Cr by nearly ﬁve orders of magnitude.

The sub-MCh models are very robust against changes in the
weak rates. When the MPLD00 rates are increased by a factor
ten, the kinetic energy changes just by 0.2% and the yield of
56Ni by 2%. However, it is interesting that the yield of stable
nickel doubles that of the model with the standard weak rates.

Modifying the rates given by Oda94 in MCh models has prac-
tically no impact on the supernova explosion dynamics and nu-
cleosynthesis. The modiﬁcation of the FFN82 rates has no im-
pact, as well, although it should be recalled that I used their rates
only when the isotope was not tabulated in the other sources of
weak rates.

The strongest impact of the modiﬁcation of weak rates is
found when all the rates in MPLD00 are increased by a factor
ten in model C3, leading to a 3% decrease in the ﬁnal kinetic
energy and a 13% decrease in the yield of 56Ni. In this same run,
the yield of 48Ca increases by nearly six orders of magnitude,

ble for a central density of the WD of ρc = 3 × 109g cm−3. The radial

rates scaled up by a factor ten (red curve).

if they remained at the center and followed the expansion of
the whole WD. Consequently the rate of neutronization drops
oﬀ as well. In models working with standard electron capture
rates, the timescale for the bubbles to start rising oﬀ the center is
∼ 0.4 − 0.6 s (García-Senz & Bravo 2005; Byrohl et al. 2018),
by which time most of the neutronization has taken place, and
the results of the present work are applicable.

In case the weak rates increased by an order of magnitude,
the time taken by the bubbles near the center (therefore, at high
density and neutronization rate) would increase sizeably. To es-
timate this time, I have calculated the dynamic evolution of a hot
bubble born near the center of a WD, incorporating the eﬀect of
electron captures into the general scheme presented in Fisher &
Jumper (2015). In their appendix, Fisher & Jumper (2015) wrote
a second order diﬀerential equation for the evolution of the ra-
dial position, r, of a hot bubble, accounting for the ﬂoatation
force and the drag on the bubble:

where t is time since bubble ignition, R is the bubble radius,
which is assumed to increase linearly with time (at constant
ﬂame velocity), g = g(r) is the local acceleration of gravity, ρf
is the local density, and ρa is the density of ashes. To incorporate
electron captures in this scheme in a simpliﬁed manner, I have
assumed that the burning is isobaric, which is valid near the cen-
ter of the WD, and that the main contribution to pressure is that
of a completely degenerate gas of electrons. Then, the pressure,
P is a function of the product ρYe and, to keep it constant, the
bubble density changes with time according to

Equation 1 can then be integrated numerically, starting from an

Fig. 2 shows the results for a WD of ρc = 3 × 109 g cm−3,
both for standard electron capture rates and for weak rates in-
creased by a factor ten. With standard electron capture rates,
the dynamical evolution of the bubble is similar to the results

that of 54Cr increases by a factor 8.9, and the yield of 54Fe de-
creases by nearly 10%. However, in this model the proton weak
rate was modiﬁed by the same factor as the weak rates on IGN,
which seems unrealistic since the uncertainty on the proton weak
rate is much smaller than those on IGN nuclei. Consequently, I
ran the same model with all the rates in MPLD00 modiﬁed with
the exception of those belonging to protons, for which the stan-
dard rate was applied. In this case, the impact is much smaller
but still noticeable: the yield of 56Ni decreases by 6.6%, that of
48Ca increases by more than three orders of magnitude, and that
of 54Cr increases by a factor 3.8, while the yield of 54Fe remains
practically unaltered.

When the same modiﬁcations are applied to models C2, C4
and C5, in order to explore the eﬀects of diﬀerent ρc, the changes
in the kinetic energy and the yield of 56Ni are similar to those for
model C3, but the nucleosynthesis changes in a diﬀerent way.
The higher the initial central density, the less sensitive the yields
of 48Ca and 54Cr to the modiﬁcation of the weak rates. The yields
of several other isotopes are especially sensitive to the weak rates
only when ρc is within a particular range. For instance, this is the
case of the yield of 80Se at ρc ∼ (4 − 5) × 109 g cm−3.

With respect to the models with diﬀerent deﬂagration veloc-
ity, models C3_100 and C3_500, I ﬁnd that the nucleosynthesis
is increasingly more sensitive to the modiﬁcation of the weak
rates of MPLD00 with increasing vdef. The reason is that, as the
deﬂagration velocity increases, a higher mass is burnt before the
white dwarf expands appreciably, then the matter in NSE has
more time to capture electrons before weak rates freeze out. The
deﬂagration-to-detonation transition density, ρDDT, does not in-
ﬂuence the sensitivity of the explosion to weak rates. The appar-
ent largest sensitivity of the yield of 56Ni in model C3_1p2 sim-
ply reﬂects the small amount of the isotope that is made out of
NSE in this model. In absolute terms, the total change in M(56Ni)

is very close for all three models with diﬀerent ρDDT and the
same ρc, ∆M(56Ni) = 0.035 − 0.045 M(cid:12).

4.2. Modiﬁcation of individual rates

Model C3 was rerun with selected weak interaction rates modi-
ﬁed by either a factor f j = 10 or f j = 0.1. The selection criterium
for choosing the rates to be modiﬁed was that they contributed to
the global change of Ye in model C3 by at least 5 × 10−7 mol g−1.
The individual rates explored were the electron captures plus β+
on and the β− decays to (all these were changed simultaneously
by the same factor) the following list of species: 28Si, 29,30P,
32S, 33,34Cl, 36Ar, 50V, 48,50−52Cr, 50,51,53−56Mn, 52−58Fe, 54−60Co,

The kinetic energy in all these models changed by less than
1% with respect to the reference model C3, and the mass of
ejected 56Ni changed by less than 1% in all but the models with
the rates on 55,56Co or 56Ni modiﬁed, in which it changed by less
than 2%.
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12), the species (from now on, the
inﬂuencers) whose weak rates caused a strong impact on any
species with a non-negligible yield. The list is leaded by iron iso-
topes, then manganese isotopes and cobalt isotopes. To be pre-
cise, the top inﬂuencer is 57Fe, whose Di, j = 0.5 in relation to the
production of 48Ca, which means that the yield of the last isotope
would change by a factor three if the weak rate on 57Fe increased
by a factor ten. 54,55Mn and 55,56Fe also stand out among the top
inﬂuencers, and all of these impact most the production of 48Ca
and then of 64Ni.

These ﬁndings contradict the results of Parikh et al. (2013),
who identiﬁed the rates on 28Si, 32S, and 36Ar as the most in-
ﬂuential for the MCh scenario, whereas the weak rates on IGN
had little impact on the nucleosynthesis. The origin of the dis-
crepancy can be traced back to the treatment of weak rates
while matter is in a NSE state. Parikh et al. (2013) had over-
looked to account for the eﬀect of changes in the weak interac-
tions of the NSE component (private communication). Since the
timescales for weak interactions are longer than the WD expan-
sion timescale and beta-equilibrium is not reached in the NSE

page 6 of 8

conditions of SNIa explosions (Brachwitz et al. 2000), quantify-
ing the impact of modiﬁed individual weak reaction rates while
matter is in the NSE state requires a re-computation of the NSE
composition at each time step, either of the post-processing cal-
culation or of the hydrodynamic calculation itself, as done in this
paper. To conﬁrm that this is the main source of the observed dif-
ferences, I have rerun model C3 conﬁning the modiﬁcation of in-
dividual weak rates to matter colder than 5 × 109 K, to match the
NSE criterion applied by Parikh et al. (2013). With this restric-
tion, the most inﬂuential rate is the β+-decay of 36Ar, while the
impact of the modiﬁcation of the weak rates on IGN decreases
by more than an order of magnitude with respect to the values
reported in Table 4.

Within the ten most inﬂuencer electron captures, only the
rates on 55Mn and 54,56Fe have been determined with the aid of
experimental information on the GT+ strength distribution. The
existence of low-lying excited states in some of the inﬂuencers
contributes to make uncertain their stellar electron capture rates.
For instance, the ﬁrst two excited states of 57Fe lie at 14.4 and
136.5 keV, to be compared to the thermal energy at the typical
temperatures of NSE matter in SNIa, kT ∼ 800 keV. Electron
capture from these excited states are favoured by the small dif-
ference between their angular momentum and that of the ground
state of 57Mn, which allows a GT+ transition, as opposed to the
ground state of 57Fe. A similar situation occurs for the electron
captures on 56Co.

tive are 48Ca and 4He, but these two species are of low interest
in SNIa from the nucleosynthetic point of view. For instance, in
model C3, the ratio of the ejected mass of 48Ca with respect to
the main nucleosynthetic product of SNIa, 56Fe, normalized to
the Solar System ratio is just 2 × 10−4. Of more interest is 64Ni,
which is mainly sensitive to the weak rates on several isotopes
of iron and manganese, with Di, j ∼ 0.2. Indeed, if all the weak
rates tabulated in MPLD00 minus those involving protons were
revised up by a factor 10, 64Ni would be overproduced with re-
spect to 56Fe in all MCh models (see Table 3). The species most
overproduced in model C3 (with standard rates) are 50Ti, 54Cr,
and 58Fe, partially because of the relatively high initial central
density. Their sensitivity to modiﬁcation of individual weak rates
is moderate, Di, j ∼ 0.06 − 0.09.

The pairing of sensitive and inﬂuencer species can be under-
stood as a result of the spatial coincidence between the regions
of synthesis of the former and the regions of maximum impact
of the second on the ﬁnal value of Ye. Figure 3 shows, for model
C3, the ﬁnal distribution of the most sensitive species within the
WD ejecta. 48Ca and 64Ni are synthesized in the innermost few
10−3 M(cid:12) of the WD, where the contribution of 57Fe and 55Mn to
the neutronization is maximal, whereas 50Ti, 54Cr, 58Fe, and 62Ni
are made in between mass coordinates 10−3 − 10−2 M(cid:12), where
most of the neutronization is provided by p, 54−56Fe and 54Mn.
On the other hand, 58Ni is made in the mass range 0.06 − 1 M(cid:12),
where most electron captures occur on p, 56Ni and 55Co.

Fig. 4 shows the mass coordinates within which the diﬀerent
species contribute most to the neutronization in the MCh models
with diﬀerent initial central density. At all values of ρc, electron
captures on protons dominate the neutronization in the central
regions of the WD, with decreasing contribution at increasing
distance to the center, and electron captures on 56Ni determine
the neutronization at M (cid:38) 0.1 − 0.2 M(cid:12). The number of species
that contribute signiﬁcantly to the neutronization increases with
ρc, but their distribution is very similar for all central densities.
Therefore, it is to be expected that the sensitivities explored for
a ρc = 3 × 109 g cm−3 are representative of models with ρc in the
range (2 − 5) × 109 g cm−3.

5. Summary

I have assessed the impact of modiﬁcations of the weak interac-
tion rates on the nucleosynthesis and other explosion properties
of SNIa models. The present work relies on the simulation of
one-dimensional models of Chandrasekhar-mass as well as sub-
Chandrasekhar mass WD SNIa models through a hydrocode that
incorporates a large enough nuclear network that the nucleosyn-
thesis can be obtained directly, and there is no need for nuclear
post-processing (Bravo et al. 2019).

Since many of the arguments in favour of the single-
degenerate scenario for SNIa progenitors rely on the detection
of neutron-rich nuclei and elements in individual SNIa and their
remnants (e.g. Höﬂich et al. 2004; Yamaguchi et al. 2015; Shen
et al. 2018), it is of particular interest to test if the explosion of
the heaviest sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs is able to produce
the yields required by the observations. And the result is that
it is not. The impact of modifying the electron capture rates in
the explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar WDs is small, even for pro-
genitors close to the upper mass limit for WDs made of carbon
and oxygen. In particular, model S+, whose progenitor mass is
MWD = 1.15 M(cid:12), is unable to produce either the central hole in
the distribution of radioactive nickel (Höﬂich et al. 2004) or the
high nickel to iron mass ratio detected in the supernova remnant
3C397 (Yamaguchi et al. 2015).

The impact of the explored changes of electron capture rates
on the main properties of Chandrasekhar-mass models, namely
the ﬁnal kinetic energy and the mass of 56Ni synthesized, is also
scarce. The yield of 56Ni may vary by as much as ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12)only
in case of a global revision of the rates upwards by an order of
magnitude, while the maximum variation obtained by changing
individual rates is limited to ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12). In comparison, current
observational estimates of the amount of 56Ni needed to power
SNIa light curves work with uncertainties of order ∼ 0.2 M(cid:12)
(Scalzo et al. 2014), although there are prospects to reduce the
error budget to ∼ 0.1 M(cid:12) (Childress et al. 2015).

I have identiﬁed three groups of species relevant for assess-
ing the impact of weak rates on SNIa: the neutronizers, which
are those that contribute most to the neutronization of mat-
ter, the inﬂuencers, which are those whose eventual weak rate
change impacts most the abundance of any species with a non-
negligible yield, and the sensitive, which are the isotopes whose
abundance is most impacted by a change in the weak rates. In
the Chandrasekhar-mass models explored in this work, the neu-
tronizers are, besides protons, 54,55Fe, 55Co, and 56Ni. The in-
ﬂuencers do not match the neutronizers point by point, they
are mainly 54,55Mn and 55−57Fe. Finally, the sensitive are those
neutron-rich nuclei made close to the center of the WD, and
which are usually overproduced in Chandrasekhar-mass SNIa
models with ρc > 2 × 109 g cm−3: 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 62,64Ni, in
agreement with Brachwitz et al. (2000) and Parikh et al. (2013).
I do not support the claim by Parikh et al. (2013) that SNIa
nucleosynthesis is most sensitive to the modiﬁcation of individ-
ual β+-decay rates of 28Si, 32S, and 36Ar. On the other hand, the
present results relative to the sensitivity of the nucleosynthesis
of SNIa to simultaneous changes in all the weak rates grossly
agree with the ﬁndings of Parikh et al. (2013). Another eﬀect I
have found of increasing globally the weak rates by an order of
magnitude is a reduced ﬂoatability of hot bubbles near the center,
which increases the time available for further electron captures
and aﬀects the overall dynamics of the explosion. These results
underline the importance of knowing the weak rates with accu-
racy, at least for Chandrasekhar-mass models.

Acknowledgements. I am grateful to Gabriel Martínez-Pinedo for providing stel-
lar weak rates tables on a ﬁne grid. Thanks are due to Robert Fisher, for inter-
esting discussions concerning the ﬂoatability of hot bubbles, and to Ivo Seiten-
zahl and Friedrich Röpke for clarifying the origin of the diﬀerences between the
present results and those of Parikh et al. The referee, Chris Fryer, has made inter-
esting suggestions to improve the presentation of this paper. This work has been
