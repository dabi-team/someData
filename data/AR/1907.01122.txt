Neutron and proton spectral functions of 40Ar, 40Ca, and 48Ti isotopes are computed using the
ab initio self-consistent Green’s function approach. The resulting radii and charge distributions are
in good agreement with available experimental data. The spectral functions of Ar and Ti are then
utilized to calculate inclusive (e,e’) cross sections within a factorization scheme and are found to
correctly reproduce the recent Jeﬀerson Lab measurements. Based on these successful agreements,
the weak charged and neutral current double-diﬀerential cross sections for neutrino-40Ar scattering
are predicted in the quasielastic region. Results obtained by replacing the (experimentally inacces-
sible) neutron spectral distribution of 40Ar with the (experimentally accessible) proton distribution
of 48Ti are compared and the accuracy of this approximation is assessed.

Introduction. Neutrinos are among the most elusive
particles in the universe. They come in three known lep-
tonic ﬂavours, each with an almost zero mass, and they
interact with matter weakly. In spite of this, they play
relevant roles in extreme astrophysical scenarios such as
supernova explosions [1]. Since the discovery of neutrino
oscillations, about two decades ago, these particles have
been playing a key role in the search of physics beyond the
Standard Model. The two most compelling open ques-
tions concern the correct hierarchy among the three mass
eigenstates and whether the neutrino is its own antipar-
ticle and can be described by a Majorana ﬁeld [2, 3]. The
existence of a fourth (sterile) neutrino has also been pro-
posed and could explain the excess of electron neutrinos
from charged current quasielastic (QE) events reported
by the MiniBooNe collaboration [4].

The new generation of neutrino experiments, such as
the short- [5] and long-baseline neutrino [6] programs
will aim at addressing these fundamental questions. In
particular, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE) has the ambitious goal of resolving the hierarchy
of mass eigenstates and test for leptonic charge-parity
violations. These experiments will utilize liquid-argon
time-projection chamber technology, which exploits scat-
tering of neutrinos oﬀ 40Ar nuclei contained in the detec-
tors. In a typical event, one or several hadrons are emit-
ted and detected to reconstruct the ﬂavor and energy of
the incident neutrino. If the latter is not reconstructed
with suﬃcient accuracy, it is not possible to pin down
the oscillation parameters to the precision needed for ex-
tracting information on the mass hierarchy [7].

Modeling neutrino-nucleus interactions in the region of
interest for neutrino oscillation experiments, extending
up to few GeV, is a very complicated problem [8]. First,
diﬀerent reaction mechanisms are at play. Depending on
the energy transferred by the probe, cross sections are
dominated by one- and two-nucleon emission processes in
the quasielastic region, excitation of nuclear resonances

that subsequently decay into pions and deep inelastic
eﬀects leading to hadron production. Second, a realis-
tic description of nuclear dynamics accounting for many-
body correlations in the target is needed. In fact, early
models based on a Fermi gas do not convey realistic de-
tails of the energy-momentum distributions of the struck
nucleon and have proven to be inadequate to reproduce
neutrino scattering data [9, 10]. Third, electroweak cur-
rent operators and reaction models need to be validated
for the GeV energies at play. Electron scattering data are
extremely important to this purpose since they can probe
the vector current operators for monochromatic incident
beams in a variety of kinematical regions. Addressing
these points is extremely important for the success of neu-
trino programs. In this regards, very promising results
have been obtained combining the impulse approxima-
tion (IA) with a realistic spectral function that embeds
many-body nuclear correlation eﬀects. This formalism
has been extensively tested in the electromagnetic sector
and recently generalized to include one- and two-body
current processes for both electron- and neutrino-nucleus
scattering processes [11–14].

The E12-14-012 experiment at Jeﬀerson Lab Hall A re-
cently analyzed the inclusive and exclusive electron scat-
tering on 12C, 40Ar and natural Ti targets at a ﬁxed
beam energy and scattering angle [15, 16]. The ﬁnal
goal of this experiment is to study the properties of the
argon nucleus and extract its proton and neutron spec-
tral functions. However, such measurements are typically
limited to ejected protons—from (e,e’p) reactions—since
neutrons have weaker longitudinal cross sections with
electrons and they would also be detected with poorer
eﬃciencies than protons. For this reason, based on the
observation that the neutron spectrum of 40Ar is mir-
rored by the proton spectrum of Ti isotopes, titanium
data have been used to gain indirect information on the
neutron spectral function of argon.

In this work we show the results obtained using the

 
 
 
 
 
 
spectral functions of Ar and Ti computed within a state-
of-the-art ab initio theory. In order to tackle these open
shell nuclei, the Self Consistent Green’s Function (SCGF)
formalism has been recently generalized in the frame of
Gorkov’s theory. The SCGF is a polynomially-scaling
many-body method that allows to eﬃciently describe nu-
clei with mass number up to A ≈ 100. Using the accu-
rate predictions obtained for proton and neutron spec-
tral functions of 40Ar and 48Ti , we calculate quasielastic
electron scattering cross section and validate against the
JLab experiment to assess their quality. We then com-
pare the theoretical neutron spectral distribution of 40Ar
with the protons in 48Ti to quantify the accuracy of the
isospin symmetry assumption and provide predictions for
neutrino-Ar scattering at the energies relevant to DUNE.
We ﬁnd that modeling neutrons in Ar upon the proton
distribution in Ti is a well justiﬁed approximation, once
that the relative shifts in the two energy spectra are taken
into account.

Theory. The double diﬀerential cross section for inclu-

sive lepton-nucleus scattering can be written as [17]:

(cid:16) dσ

(cid:17)

dE(cid:48)dΩ(cid:48)

(cid:96)

= C(cid:96)

E(cid:48)

LµνW µν ,

(1)

where Lµν is the leptonic tensor and k = (Ek, k) and
k(cid:48) = (E(cid:48)
k, k(cid:48)) are the laboratory four-momenta of the
incoming and outgoing leptons, respectively. The fac-
tor C(cid:96) = α/(k − k(cid:48))4 for electrons and C(cid:96) = G/8π2 for
neutrinos, where G = GF for neutral current (NC) and
G = GF cos θc for charged current (CC) processes. The
electroweak coupling constants are α (cid:39) 1/137, GF =
1.1803 × 10−5 GeV−2 [18] and cos θc = 0.97425 [19].

The hadron tensor W µν encodes the transition matrix
elements from the target ground state |ΨA
0 (cid:105) to the ﬁnal
states |ΨA
f (cid:105) due to the hadronic currents, which include
additional axial terms for neutrino scattering. For the
case of quasielastic processes at moderate values of the
momentum transfer (|q| >
∼ 500 MeV), the impulse ap-
f (cid:105) → |p(cid:48)(cid:105)⊗|ΨA−1
proximation allows to factorize |ΨA
(cid:105) into
the outgoing nucleon of momentum p(cid:48) and the residual
nucleus in a state |ΨA−1

(cid:105). This leads to [13, 14]:

isospin degrees of freedom s and Sh
s (p, E) is the one-
hole spectral function normalized to the total number of
nucleons. For two-body currents and hadron production,
Eq. (2) extends non trivially in terms of one- and two-
body spectral functions [14, 20–22].

Final-state interactions (FSI) of the struck nucleon can
be accounted for using Glauber theory [22–26]. For the
inclusive processes discussed here we follow Ref. [26]:

(cid:90)

dσF SI (ω) =

dω(cid:48) fq(ω − ω(cid:48) − UV )dσ(ω(cid:48)) ,

(3)

where UV and the function fq(ω) account for the shift
in the cross section and the redistribution of strength
away from the quasielastic peak due to interactions of
the ejected nucleon with the mean ﬁeld of the residual
system and rescattering processes, respectively [26, 27].
Since, to the best of our knowledge, optical potentials
for Ar and Ti are not available in the literature, in the
present work we use the one of 40Ca taken from Ref. [28]
and the folding function of Ref. [26].

The internal structure of the target is encoded in the

diagonal part of the one-hole spectral function,

where cs(p) annihilates a nucleon with momentum p and

such as Ar and Ti isotopes, we extract the spectral func-
tion from the imaginary part of the normal one-body
π Im{Gh(p, p; µ − E)}, com-
propagator, Sh
puted in ab initio Gorkov self-consistent Green’s func-
tion (GGF) theory [29–31]. The Gorkov formulation
of propagator theory breaks particle-number conserva-
tion explicitly and uses a grand canonical Hamiltonian,
ˆΩ = ˆH −µp ˆZ −µn ˆN , with chemical potentials µp,n tuned
to recover the correct number of protons and neutron on
average. Breaking of the particle-number symmetry im-
plies the appearance of both normal and anomalous one-
body propagators, however, it accounts for pairing cor-
relations and lifts the degeneracies that would otherwise
prevent microscopic calculations for open-shell systems.
In GGF theory, the propagator is obtained as solution
of Gorkov equations, which generalize standard Dyson
equation and encode the many-body expansion in nor-
mal and anomalous self-energy terms [29].

Results. In this work, we solve Gorkov equations using
14 major harmonic oscillators shells and vary the fre-
quency, (cid:126)Ω, to study the uncertainties resulting from the
truncation of the model space. The self-energy is ex-
panded up to second-order in an optimised reference state
(OpRS) propagator (see Refs [13, 32] for details). This
many-body truncation, normally referred to as ADC(2),
includes triplets of non interacting Gorkov quasiparticles
and it incorporates the two hole-one particle (2h1p) con-
ﬁgurations of the residual nucleus |Ψ(A−1)
(cid:105) that lead to
the 2p2h contributions to the ﬁnal state |ΨA
f (cid:105). Since
lepton scattering is sensitive to matter and momentum
distribution of the target, we employ the NNLOsat chiral
interaction of Ref. [33] that has been shown to repro-
duce accurately electron scattering on 16O [13] as well

as the radii and charge density distributions for isotopes
up to 48Ca [34–37]. From the analysis of Ref. [32], it is
known that the range (cid:126)Ω = 14 − 20 MeV includes the
optimal values for the convergence of both radii and en-
ergies. Thus, we perform computations at the extremes
of this interval and take the diﬀerences in our results as
conservative estimates for the theoretical errors due to
model space convergence. The quality of our predictions
is demonstrated by Fig. 1, where we compare charge den-
sity proﬁles computed in GGF-ADC(2) for 40Ca and 40Ar
to experimental data from Refs. [38, 39]. The resulting
charge radii are 3.43(3), 3.52(4) and 3.60(4) fm for 40Ar,
40Ca and 48Ti, respectively, to be compared to the exper-
imental values of 3.427, 3.477 and 3.607 fm [40]. For 40Ar
we ﬁnd point proton and neutron radii of rp = 3.33(3)
and rn = 3.41(4) fm, corresponding to a neutron skin
thickness of 0.08(1) fm. This value is consistent with
the estimate of Ref. [41], although their proton and neu-
tron radii computed with the same NNLOsat interaction
slightly diﬀer from our results. For 40Ca, we also per-
formed computations with the more accurate ADC(3)
truncation and found negligible changes in the charge
density proﬁle. Hence, Fig. 1 is substantially converged
with respect to many-body truncations, as already found
in Ref. [36] for S and Si isotopes.

The key point in the factorization approach to the
hadronic contributions of Eq. (2) is that, within the limit
of validity of the IA, the scattering process can be de-
scribed as an incoherent sum of lepton scattering ampli-
tudes on bound nucleons, provided that the process is
averaged over the probability of ﬁnding nucleons in the
target with given initial momentum and energies. The
hole spectral function, Sh
s (p, E) encodes exactly this in-
formation, since it has a speciﬁc interpretation as the
joint probability of removing a nucleon with momentum
p after transferring energy E to the target nucleus. As

ticle and hole spectral functions are identiﬁed respectively

arrow).

an example, Fig. 2 displays the computed Sh
s (p, E) for
neutron removal from 40Ar, as well as the corresponding
neutron-addition part Sp
s (p, E). The dominant peaks at
low separation energies (small values of |E|) carry infor-
mation on the momentum distribution of nucleons oc-
cupying the valence ‘orbits’ near the Fermi surface. As
the separation energy increases, the distribution becomes
more spread and covers the particles associated with the
nuclear core. For large separation energies (not shown
here), E < -60 MeV and |p| > 2 fm−1, the spectral
function presents a mild tail carrying the strength at
larger momenta, typically associated with short-distance
interactions among nucleons. The correlation between
high missing energies and momenta in such tail is a very
general feature for self-bound systems (such as nuclei)
and it is dictated by kinematical constraints. It must be
stressed that the amount of spectral strength in this tail
depends on the scale resolution associated to the chosen
nuclear Hamiltonian. In spite of being a relatively soft
interaction, with a cutoﬀ of 450 MeV/c, NNLOsat still
predicts the presence of larger momentum components.
Nevertheless, such components are clearly weaker than
the ones obtained from high-accuracy (and high-cutoﬀ)
phenomenological forces such as AV18 [13].

Many-body correlations control the location of the hole
spectral strength. Since it remains mostly contained in
a region of approximately −100 MeV < E < 0 MeV,
the very ﬁne details of the distribution are less impor-
tant for the inclusive reactions and the lepton probes at
few GeV energies that are relevant for the present work.
In fact, models based on the relativistic Green’s func-
tion approach [42, 43] describe well the electron scatter-

Ref. [15, 16] and show both the quasielastic peak and the con-
tribution from meson production at larger missing energies.

ing data in the quasielastic peak starting from available
relativistic mean-ﬁelds and optical potentials [16]. This
description is already superior to a Fermi-gas model, to
an extent that the description of neutrino-nucleus scat-
tering is noticeably impacted [14, 44, 45]. The ab initio
spectral function of Fig. 2 is computed directly from the
underlying two- and three -nucleon interactions and it
contains even more detailed information about the struc-
ture of the nuclear target. The knowledge of Sh
s (p, E)
can then impact the accurate determination of the cross
sections, especially for exclusive events. The quality of
our spectral functions is tested by computing the in-
clusive electron scattering on 40Ar and 48Ti at the en-
ergy and kinematics of the E12-14-012 JLab experiment.
The resulting cross sections are displayed in Fig. 3 as a
function of the energy transfer and reproduce closely the
quasielastic peak from experimental data. In the present
calculation, we have neglected two-nucleon currents and
meson-production contributions that dominate the cross
section at higher energy transfer [12]. The dashed and
solid curves in the ﬁgures demonstrate the eﬀect of FSI.
Note that the colored band in the FSI curve also shows
the uncertainty from model space convergence that has
been estimated as discussed above. This is representative
of both curves and shows that our calculations are near
full convergence with respect to the model space. The

inclusion of FSI produces a small shift in the position of
the quasielastic peak that improves the description for
ω < 180 MeV. On the other hand, strength is removed
from the maximum of the peak and moved to the tail.
Hence, the prediction based on the NNLOsat interaction
and GGF-ADC(2) for ground state correlations slightly
underestimates the experimental data at the peak. Over-
all, the discrepancy is still rather small and it is compat-
ible with the larger uncertainties that are intrinsic with
the accuracy of state-of-the-art nuclear forces [46].

Let us now turn to inclusive neutrino scattering on
40Ar, based on the SCGF spectral function and the re-
action model discussed above. The electroweak current
is given by the sum of an axial and vector components.
The latter is connected to the electromagnetic current
through the conserved vector current hypothesis and is
probed by electron scattering measurements. Figure 4
displays the computed inclusive cross sections at 1 GeV
scattering energy for neutral and charged current reac-
tions. The dashed line shows the analogous calculation
for 12C for comparison. The quasielastic peak is found
at similar transferred energies for both 40Ar and 12C
and its magnitude increases with the mass number, as
expected from superscaling properties of inclusive reac-
tions [47, 48].

While in neutral current processes, the cross section

tions, the charged current select only one of them. In par-
ticular, charged current neutrino scattering probes the
neutron spectral distribution of the nucleus. The need to
gain information on the neutron spectral distribution has
indeed motivated the electron scattering measurements
in Ti isotopes, whose proton number equals the neutron
number of 40Ar, with the idea of exploiting isospin sym-
metry [15]. Besides the presence of the Coulomb poten-
tial, which results in an overall energy shift of the spectral
function, it is not clear to which extent such a substitu-
tion is valid. In particular, since the mirror isotope 40Ti
is unstable and heavier Ti (mainly 48Ti) have to be used
in electron scattering experiments, nuclear structure ef-
fects might play an important role. To test the impact
of this approximation we recomputed the cross sections
of Fig. 4 substituting the neutron spectral function of
40Ar with the one computed for protons in 48Ti for both
neutral and charged current processes. The two curves
result nearly identical at these energies, with discrepan-
cies below 1% (2%) not only for neutral but also also for
charged currents, where the validity of the replacement
can be analyzed in greater detail.

Summary. We have computed the one-nucleon removal
spectral functions of open-shell 40Ar and 48Ti isotopes,
using ab initio SCGF theory and saturating chiral inter-
actions. Nuclear correlations were accounted for in the
GGF-ADC(2) scheme that allows to obtain converged nu-
clear radii (with respect to many-body truncations) and
crude yet quantitative predictions of the fragmentation
of the spectral function. The comparison with available
electron scattering data are very satisfactory for both
charge distributions and high-energy inclusive electron
scattering up to the quasielastic peak.

Based on this successful comparison, we used the
functions as input to predict inclusive neu-
spectral
trino cross sections on 40Ar at 1 GeV. In this case, the
quasielastic peak is centered at around missing energies
of 150 MeV and extends up to (cid:39) 300 MeV. Future studies
will be needed (and will be possible within the present
framework) to thoroughly assess all theoretical uncer-
tainties,
in particular those associated with the input
Hamiltonian, ideally within a rigorous eﬀective ﬁeld the-
ory approach. Our ﬁndings support the hypothesis of
Refs. [15, 16] that approximating the mean-ﬁeld neutron
spectral distribution of 40Ar with the one for protons
in Ti isotopes leads to very accurate results for neu-
trino scattering at the few GeV energies that are relevant
to long-based neutrino oscillations experiments. Further
data from exclusive (e,e’p) measurements on 40Ar and Ti
will therefore be very important both to confront ﬁrst-
principle nuclear structure approaches and to constrain
the reaction rates needed for present and future genera-
tions of neutrino detectors.
