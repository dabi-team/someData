Abstract 
__________________________________________________________________ 

Dictyostelium  discoideum  is  an  ideal  organism  to  test  the  pathogenicity  of  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa,  since  its  eukaryote  nature  allows  for  comparisons  to  be  made  to  human  health. 
Additionally,  D.  discoideum  naturally  feeds  on  bacteria  and  has  a  simplistic  genome  which 
improves  result  interpretation.    P.  aeruginosa  is  a  free  living  bacteria  that  is  recognized  for  its 
ability  to  cause  nosocomial,  hospital  contracted,  infections  in  immunocompromised  patients. 
This  experiment  attempts  to  understand  how  various  strains  of  D.  discoideum  may  be  more 
susceptible  or  resistant  to  infections  caused  by  P.  aeruginosa,  as  a  result  of  environmentally 
induced adaptive mechanisms. Wild-type strains of D. discoideum will be isolated from Massard 
Prairie  soil  and  compared  to  axenic-type  strains  that  have  been  cultured  free  from  association 
with  other  microbiota.  The  results  of  this  experiment  may  support  studies  done  on  conserved 
virulence pathways in bacteria and give insight into virulence of P. aeruginosa in humans. There 
is evidence that Dictyostelium has capabilities that allow for protection against bacteria similar to 
P.  aeruginosa.16  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  the  wild-type  D.  discoideum  will  have  adaptive 
mechanisms  that  which  will  cause  resistance  to  P.  aeruginosa,  unlike  axenic-type  strains  that 
will have limited resistivity.

Introduction 
__________________________________________________________________ 

The  soil  amoeba,  Dictyostelium  discoideum,  has  been  recognized  globally  for  being  a  model 
organism because of its genetic similarities to many eukaryotic organisms. The simplicity of this 
organism has been useful in studies that relate to genetics, chemical, and cellular process. There 
have been numerous experiments that have studied the virulent effects Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
on  axenic-type  D.  discoideum  in  attempts  of  identifying  conserved  virulent  pathways  that 
contribute  to  infection.  It  has  been  determined  that  there  are  two  main  pathways  in  mutant 
bacteria  which  are  used  to  infect  amoebae,  quorum  sensing  mediated  virulence  and  type  III 
secretion  of  virulence  factors.1,11  Quorum  sensing  virulence  refers  to  the  bacteria’s  ability  to 
release  chemical  signals  as  the  concentration  of  bacteria  grows.  This  physiological  effect  has 
been  shown  to  have  many  implications  in  bacterial  functions.  Type  III  secretion  systems  have 
also been  found  in many pathogenic bacteria and  have been  identified  in the direct  injection  of 
cytotoxins into host cells, this leads to infection and antibiotic resistance.1,12 P. aeruginosa is an 
opportunistic  bacteria  that  is  known  to  cause  nosocomial  infections  that  can  lead  to  severe 
illness. It has been determined that the  virulence  of  P. aeruginosa  is controlled by two quorum 
sensing pathways, las and rhl, which leads to the secretion of virulence factors.13 It is capable of 
infecting  various  host  systems  of  varying  complexities,  therefore  D.  discoideum  is  a  good 
alternative to other more expensive and complicated organisms.2 The experiment will isolate D. 
discoideum soil samples obtained from undisrupted areas of Massard Prairie and disrupted areas 
of Massard Prairie found in Ben Geren Park. These locations should have different soil contents 
that is since one area is exposed to a multitude of chemicals and the other is not. The proposed 
experiment  would  analyze  the  virulence  of  P.  aeruginosa  towards  wild  type  D.  discoideum 
obtained  from  two  different  soil  samples  and  against  axenic-type  D.  discoideum.  Utilizing  two 
different  wild-type  D.  discoideum  strains,  obtained  from  the  Massard  Prairie  soil  samples,  will 
insure  that  any  virulent  resistance  and  susceptibility  can  be  analyzed  based  on  the  native 
environment of the organism. One wild-type strain will be obtained from unadulterated Massard 
Prairie  soil,  which  will  ensure  that  that  normal  wild-type  processes  are  developed  in  the 
organism according to its natural environment. The other wild-type strain of D. discoideum will 
be  isolated  from  soil  obtained  from  Ben  Geren  Park,  since  it  may  contain  an  assortment  of 
chemicals. It is expected that microorganisms and chemicals present in the soil will influence the 
amoeba's  susceptibility  to  bacterial  virulence.  Isolated  wild-type  strains  along  with  an  axenic 
amoeba strain will be  inoculated with  P. aeruginosa to test  virulence resistivity.  P. aeruginosa 
may  have  implications  in  research  that  are  focused  on  addressing  areas  of  biomedical  research 
focused  on  antibiotic  resistance  and  adaptive  immunity.  Many  studies  utilize  isolated  axenic 
strains  developed  in  laboratories,  such  as  Northwestern  University  in  Chicago,  which  ensures 
integrity of axenic nature. Axenic-type strains are not in association with other microbiota during 
cultivation, therefore, they may have less adaptive strategies developed. Many experiments rely 
on  axenic-type  strains  of  D.  discoideum  to  gather  simplified  results  that  are  not  influenced  by 
extrinsic factors. As a result, only a limited number of experiments have been performed to test 
the virulent resistance of non-axenic type D. discoideum to P. aeruginosa. The hypothesis is that 
wild-type  D.  discoideum  will  have  developed  adaptive  capabilities,  resulting  in  increased 
resistance to P. aeruginosa pathogenicity.

Isolation of wild-type D. discoideum from soil samples 

There  are  nine  species  of  Dictyostelium  along  with  countless  other  species  of  soil  amoeba  that 
have been identified, and likely many more that have yet to be discovered. In a soil sample it is 
common  to  obtain  many  species  of  Dictyostelium  along  with  other  organisms,  such  as 
mycobacteria,  slime  molds,  pathogens.  Wild-type  strains  D.  discoideum  will  be  obtained  from 
soil samples taken at two locations of Massard Prairie in Fort Smith, Arkansas FIG. 1. Currently, 
the  Massard  Prairie  is  being  restored  so  there  may  be  remnants  of  prairie  being  treated  with 
potential  fertilizer and chemicals  FIG. 2. Further  collaboration will  be  needed with Ben Geren 
Parks  management  to  identify  whether  amoeba  should  be  isolated  from  native  or  restored 
regions. 

FIG. 1. Ben Geren Park located on the Massard Prairie10 

One  of  the  locations  will  be  a  remnant  of  the  native  untouched  prairie;  the  other  will  obtained 
from  Ben  Geren  Park,  also  a  remnant  of  the  prairie,  that  may  continue  to  undergo  toxic 
treatments of synthetic fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, and other chemicals.

Wild-type D. discoideum grows best in area of high moisture, so samples of soil will be obtained 
from  under  decomposing  logs,  next  to  trees,  or  streams.  When  collecting  soil  samples,  gloves 
should be worn and a clean spoon used to handle sample. Soil should be kept in a Ziploc bag and 
labeled (location, sample  number). Once samples are obtained the begin  experiment by  making 
SM  agar  plates.  SM  agar  plates  are  made  by  mixing:  10g  glucose,  10g  protease  peptone,  1g 
MgSO4x7H2O, 1.9g KH2PO4, 0.6g K2HPO4, 20g bacto agar, 900 mL distilled water. The mixture 
was autoclaved for 20 minutes for sterilization and 35 mL was poured into each plate. 1 liter of 
SM  broth  was  made  by  mixing  10  g  glucose,  10  g  proteose  peptone,  1  g  yeast  extract,  1  g 
MgSO4x7H2O (or 0.5 g MgSO4), 1.9 g KH2PO4, 0.6 g K2HPO4. Titrations of KOH were used to 
adjust the pH between 6.0 - 6.4. In a 10 mL tube, make a 1:10 dilution for each soil sample by 
adding  1.0  gram  of  the  sample  to  9.0  mL  of  distilled  water,  and  vortex  for  5-10  seconds. 
Immediately after following the suspension of soil in water, make a second tenfold dilution (take 
another 10 mL tube) by pipetting 1.0 mL (debris should not be pipetted) of the 1:10 dilution into 
9.0 mL of distilled water. This  is 1:100 dilution. Vortex for 5-10 seconds. Make a final 1:1000 
dilution  by  adding  1.0  mL  of  the  1:100  dilution  to  9.0  mL  of  distilled  water.  Vortex  for  5-10 
seconds. Take 200 μL of the 1:1000 suspension in a 1.5 mL tube. To this tube add 300 μL of a 
non-pathogenic E. coli culture (grown in SM media). Vortex each sample tubes for 5-10 seconds. 
Pipette  500  μl  sample/E.coli  suspension  and  spread  onto  SM  agar  plate.  Plate  D.  discoideum 
cells  grown  on  SM  media  with  E.coli  to  allow  comparison  of  the  isolated  strains  to  a  known 
strain. The plates should be incubated (with upside down) for 1 week at 22°C (low temperature 
incubator). Following  the  incubation period, plates should be  inspected under stereomicroscope 
or inverted microscope for evidence of amoebae. Look for clearing zones in the agar or fruiting 
bodies.  Various  filamentous  fungi  will  spread  over  the  plate  with  time,  so  plates  need  to  be 
checked  frequently  to  find  colonies  before  they  are  overgrown.    If  you  see  fruiting  bodies  or 
plaques, use a pipette tip to carefully harvest them. Suspend the harvest in 400 μL of the  E.coli 
culture  before  plating  the  E.coli  +  isolate  on  a  SM  plate.  The  fruiting  bodies  from  these  plates 
should be  harvested and re-plated  in this same  manner until there  is  no more evidence  of  other 
organisms competing or coexisting with the wild-type D. discoideum.3 

Initiation of axenic culture of D. discoideum from wild-type plate growth 

D.  discoideum  cells  can  easily  be  transferred  from  a  plate  to  axenic  growth  in  suspension. 
Separation  of bacteria and D. discoideum occurs owing to the difference  in weight between the 
two cell types. Use a sterile loop to remove amoebae from a single colony from either bacterial 
growth  plate  bacterial  plate  (use  vegetative  cells  from  the  feeding  front  at  the  perimeter  of  the 

4 

 
 
 
 
plaque,  where  cells  are  feeding  and  dividing)  and  suspend  in  0.2  ml  fresh  bacterial  overnight 
culture.  Using  a  sterilized  glass  spatula,  spread  the  bacteria-wild-type  D.  discoideum  mixture 
onto an SM agar plate and incubate at 22°C. Harvest the cells when the plates have been cleared 
of bacteria but before fruiting bodies have formed (2-3 days) by flooding the plate with 3-4 ml of 
DB.  Recover  cells  by  gently  scraping  with  a  sterile  spatula,  transfer  to  a  50  ml  conical  plastic 
tube, fill with 40 mL DB, briefly  vortex and centrifuge at 500g for 4 min at room temperature. 
Discard the cloudy supernatant containing the bacteria and resuspend the  D. discoideum cells in 
45 ml DB. Wash four more times to remove as many bacterial cells as possible. Resuspend the 
final  pellet  in  25  mL  HL5  containing  streptomycin  and  ampicillin  and  transfer  to  a  125  ml 
Erlenmeyer  flask.  The  medium  should  only  contain  0.03  grams  in  streptomycin  per  liter  of 
nutrient  medium,  as  its  purpose  is  to  prevent  bacterial  contamination  of  Dictyostelium.  If  the 
culture  is  kept  open  for  prolonged  periods  of  time  the  culture  is  has  a  higher  likelihood  to 
become contaminated. Adding a minimal amount of streptomycin will also prevent it from cause 
genetic  mutations  in  Dictyostelium  and  changing  morphology.  If  D.  discoideum  morphology  is 
changed  the  results  become  more  complex  and  it  becomes  difficult  to  decipher  whether  the 
results  are  permissible.  Next,  the  Erlenmeyer  flask  should  be  incubated  for  2-3  days  at  22°C, 
shaking at 180 r.p.m. Transfer a small  volume (1-2 ml)  into a 250 mL  flask  containing 50 mL 
fresh HL5; at this point, the addition of antibiotics is optional. These cells can now be maintained 
axenically  as described. To  exclude bacteria, make  sure that  the supernatant  is cloudy after the 
first  centrifugation,  indicative  of  a  large  number  of  bacteria  remaining  in  suspension;  if  not, 
reduce  the  speed  and/or  the  time  of  centrifugation.  Cloudiness  should  diminish  with  each 
washing step.4 Axenic-type D. discoideum cells may be requested from the Dicty Stock Center, a 
central repository for Dictyostelium discoideum strains, in order to circumvent the axenic culture 
protocol.  In  conducting  this  experiment,  it  is  also  advisable  to  plate  all  wild-type  strains  of  D. 
discoideum with E. coli bacteria so these control groups can be used for comparisons.  

Inoculation of P. aeruginosa to wild-type and axenic-type strain D. discoideum 

In this experiment virulence susceptibility of wild-type and axenic-type strains of D. discoideum 
to  P.  aeruginosa  can  be  determined  by  inoculating  plates  and  measuring  the  size  of  amoeba 
induced  plaques.  All  cell  cultures  of  D.  discoideum  cells  strains  need  to  be  diluted  equally  to 
insure  that  concentration  of  plated  amoeba  is  proportional  to  added  bacteria.  The  protocol  to 
accomplish this begins by identifying initial cell concentration of all cultured amoeba strains and 
diluting  to  a  set  concentration  using  a  HL5  medium.  If  the  initial  concentration  of  cultured 
amoeba is 6x107cells/mL, then it will be diluted by the addition of 5999 µL (5.999 mL) of HL5 
medium. Next, 100 µL of the diluted culture (100 dicty cells) will be placed on the SM agar plate 
that contains 200 µL of P. aeruginosa bacterial culture. This protocol would be applied to both 
wild-types and the axenic-type strain of amoeba. When D. discoideum is grown on bacteria, the 
cells have a doubling time that is approximately 4 hours, while cells grown in an axenic medium 
have a slower growth rate  of  about 8-12  hours  for  doubling time.5  It  is  often desirable to grow 
Dictyostelium  cells  as  a  pure  culture  in  the  absence  of  bacteria,  however  wild -type  strains  are 
unable to grow in axenic conditions. Cells grown in axenic mediums have slower growth rates, 
with a doubling time of roughly 8 12 hours depending on temperature, medium and the presence 
of selective drugs.6 Growth can also vary significantly between different cell lines. Axenic-type 
strains can easily be transferred from bacterial growth conditions to axenic culture.4

Time dependent plate analysis of strains 

All plated D. discoideum strains should be allowed  to replicate  for 12  hours to allow sufficient 
time  for  axenic-type  strain  growth  to  develop.7  Plates  should  be  viewed  under  a  microscope  to 
make  initial  observations  and  analyzed  with  ImageJ-plugin  “ColonyArea”.  This  tool  would  be 
used  to  quantitatively  analyze  area  of  Dictyostelium  plaques  in  all  the  plates.  Area  of  plaques 
would give an idea as to how fast or slow different species of  Dictyostelium grow in presence of 
P. aeruginosa. The program works by processing data obtained through pictures of various dishes 
and  separating  organisms  and  formations  based  on  color,  texture,  and  size  and  eventually 
quantifying  the  data.  The  program  does  not  count  the  total  number  of  colonies,  instead  it 
determines the total percentage of area covered by the colonies and measuring the cell density of 
the area.8 The experiment should be replicated multiple times to insure accuracy, and the results 
should be standardized by graphing ImageJ data with respect to time.  

Results 
__________________________________________________________________ 

The  results  of  this  experiment  should  support  the  hypothesis,  that  wild-type  strain  of  D. 
discoideum was resistant or even less susceptible to infection caused by P. aeruginosa. However, 
axenic-type strain D. discoideum should be infected by the bacteria since it has remained isolated 
from  other  microbiota  and  has  not  developed  bacterial  resistivity  mechanisms.  New  research 
shows  that  D.  discoideum  can  grow  symbiotic  bacteria  for  nutrition  by  passing  them  along 
through  generations  and  that  these  symbiotic  bacteria  can  also  protect  the  amoeba  from 
environmental  toxins.9  There  may  also  be  membrane  bound  proteins  that  mediate  amoeba 
defensive  behaviors  and  play  an  essential  role  in  bacterial  resistivity.17  If  wild-type  D. 
discoideum  is  able  to  resist  the  pathogenicity  of  P.  aeruginosa,  it  will  be  evident  by  plaques 
formed  on  the  plates  where  the  amoeba  feed  on  the  bacteria.  There  should  be  no  evidence  of 
plaque formed on the axenic plates, since the bacteria will infects the amoeba and kill it. Based 
on these assumptions it is possible to analyze the plates using ImageJ software and quantify any 
differences  between  the  two  organisms  by  plaque  formation.  It  is  also  key  that  all  plates  are 
analyzed at consistent time intervals to insure that plaque formation is not skewed by a factor of 
time.  FIG.  3  depicts  bacterial  plates  being  analyzed  based  on  intensity  using  ImageJ-plugin 
“ColonyArea”. Growth of  D. discoideum plaques will be measured using this technique and the 
results will be quantified and compared between the different strains used.19 Axenic-type strain 
D. discoideum is commonly used in research since it is cultivated over a period of time without 
the association to other microbes; hence, there is less error caused by extrinsic variables. Wild-
type  strains  of  D.  discoideum  associate  with  a  multitude  of  organisms,  therefore  its  behavior 
differs from axenic-type strains. Temperature and water accessibility may also play a role in  D. 
discoideum  resistance  since  they  influence  the  overall  development.  Wild-type  strain  of  D. 
discoideum  obtained  from  a  non-native  prairie  region,  of  Ben  Geren  Park,  will  be  exposed  to 
greater  amounts  of  environmental  stresses,  such  as  more  direct  sunlight  and  chemicals,  via 
resulting in the evolution of mechanisms to cope with these factors. However, it is expected that 
wild-type native prairie D. discoideum will only be influenced by microorganisms present in the 
soil.  Overall,  it  is  expected  that  both  wild-type  strains  of  D.  discoideum  strains  will  be  more 
resistant to P. aeruginosa, while the axenic-type strain will be most susceptible to infection.

Research has shown that the Dictyostelium model is predictive for P. aeruginosa virulence in a 
rat model.2 It is expected that the results of pathogenicity experiments obtained using D. 
discoideum will be similar to experiments on rat (mammalian model), thus Dictyostelium is a 
simple non-mammalian system to study pathogenicity. 

Discussion 
__________________________________________________________________ 

P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes nosocomial infections in patients 
with  compromised  immune systems, such as urinary tract  infections  in pregnant women,  cystic 
fibrosis, and cancer patients.2 In this study, the wild-type D. discoideum is to be extracted from 
two locations. The first soil sample would come from a undisturbed prairie that contained limited 
pollutants. The second soil sample would come from a high traffic and well visited area that had 
been  previously  treated  with  chemicals.  The  overall  purpose  of  the  project  is  to  confirm  that 
environmental  differences  alter  specific  wild-type  strains  of  D.  discoideum  that  leads  to 
adaptation  and  resistance  to  P.  aeruginosa.  Research  studies  have  found  that  the  slugs  of 
Dictyostelium  have  small  specialized  cells  that  protect  them.16  Through  generations  of  these 
cells, there may be developed capabilities that allow for protection against bacteria similar to  P. 
aeruginosa.  Based  on  this  research,  the  wild-type  strain  of  D.  discoideum,  collected  from 
chemically  treated  soil,  is  expected  to  be  the  most  resistant  sample  since  it  may  possess 
specialized  protective  cells.16  The  Center  for  Disease  Control  states  that  the  P.  aeruginosa 
pathogen is one of the most common causes for bacterial infections, however, the effectiveness 
of  treatment  towards  P.  aeruginosa  is  decreasing  since  its  becoming  more  resistant  to 
antibiotics.14 A project that may arise from this experimental proposal is identifying the species 
of Dictyostelium obtained from Ben Geren Park and comparing them to species of Dictyostelium 
known  to  the  state  of  Arkansas.  In  a  study  that  analyzed  Dictyostelid  cellular  slime  molds  in 
Arkansas;  167  samples  were  collected  and  2,082  individual  clones  representing  13  different 
species  were  identified,  plus  one  form  that  could  not  be  assigned  to  any  described  species.18 
Performing  such  an  experiment  may  open  new  avenues  of  research  and  could  lead  to  the 

7 

 
 
 
 
discovery  of  new  Dictyostelium  clones.  All  in  all,  this  research  could  be  utilized  in  studies 
focused  on  studying  antibiotic  resistance  in  humans  and  may  aid  in  the  identification  of  other 
virulent pathways that bring about infection.
