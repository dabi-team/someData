Solar Active Region Coronal Jets II: Triggering and Evolution of
Violent Jets

Alphonse C. Sterling1, Ronald L. Moore1,2, David A. Falconer1,2, Navdeep K. Panesar1,
and Francisco Martinez3

ABSTRACT

We study a series of X-ray-bright, rapidly-evolving active-region coronal jets
outside the leading sunspot of AR 12259, using Hinode/XRT, SDO/AIA and
HMI, and IRIS data. The detailed evolution of such rapidly evolving “violent”
jets remained a mystery after our previous investigation of active region jets
(Sterling et al. 2016, Paper 1). The jets we investigate here erupt from three lo-
calized subregions, each containing a rapidly evolving (positive) minority-polarity
magnetic-ﬂux patch bathed in a (majority) negative-polarity magnetic-ﬂux back-
ground. At least several of the jets begin with eruptions of what appear to be
∼2′′) miniature-ﬁlament (miniﬁlament) “strands” from a mag-
thin (thickness <
netic neutral line where magnetic ﬂux cancelation is ongoing, consistent with the
magnetic conﬁguration presented for coronal-hole jets in Sterling et al. (2015).
Some jets strands are diﬃcult/impossible to detect, perhaps due to, e.g. their
thinness, obscuration by surrounding bright or dark features, or the absence of
erupting cool-material miniﬁlaments in those jets. Tracing in detail the ﬂux evo-
lution in one of the subregions, we ﬁnd bursts of strong jetting occurring only
during times of strong ﬂux cancelation. Averaged over seven jetting episodes,
the cancelation rate was ∼1.5×1019 Mx hr−1. An average ﬂux of ∼5×1018 Mx
canceled prior to each episode, arguably building up ∼1028—1029 ergs of free mag-
netic energy per jet. From these and previous observations, we infer that ﬂux
cancelation is the fundamental process responsible for the pre-eruption buildup
and triggering of at least many jets in active regions, quiet regions, and coronal
holes.

Introduction

Solar coronal jets are dynamic features that grow to long lengths compared to their
widths. They occur in all solar environments: quiet Sun, coronal holes, and the edges of
active regions (Raouaﬁ et al. 2016). Yohkoh’s soft X-ray telescope (SXT) primarily saw
them in active regions (e.g. Shibata et al. 1992; Shimojo et al. 1996), while Hinode’s X-ray
telescope (XRT) found them to be plentiful in polar coronal holes also (Cirtain et al. 2007).
In polar coronal holes they typically reach heights of ∼50,000 km and widths of ∼8000 km,
occurring at a rate of ∼60/day in the two polar holes, and having lifetimes of ∼10 min
(Savcheva et al. 2007). Pucci et al. (2013) found such jets to have energies ∼1026—1027 erg
for the hotter component of the jet, and they point out that the chromospheric/cool-coronal
jet that sometimes accompanies the hot component (Moore et al. 2010, 2013) could increase
this by about an order of magnitude. In a study weighted toward active region jets (where
68% of 100 jets occurred in active regions, and the others in either coronal holes or quiet
Sun), Shimojo et al. (1996) report: a large range of lengths, averaging 1.5 × 105 km; a large
range of lifetimes, going from ∼100 s to ∼ 4 hrs; and outward velocities ranging over 100—
400 km s−1, with an average of 200 km s−1. For a sample of jets, Shimojo & Shibata (2000)
found energies of ∼1027—∼1029 erg. Independent of where they occur on the Sun, essentially
all coronal jets observed in X-rays appear as a bright spire with a base brightening, often
with the brightest part of the base sitting on one side of the base; we call this a jet-base
bright point (JBP). (In EUV images the JBP is also usually apparent as a sharp brightening,
although at times it does not stand out as distinctly as it does in X-rays, due to factors such as
the details of the EUV passbands and the possible presence of obscuring cooler-temperature
material.)

Explaining the JBP in addition to the spire has been a key aspect of proposed physi-
cal mechanisms for what produces the jets. An early suggestion was that newly emerging
magnetic ﬂux elements reconnecting with ambient coronal ﬁelds produces the jets (e.g.,
Shibata et al. 1992; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995). This emerging-ﬂux model for coronal jets
was put forth when the best data available in which to see jets were X-ray images, and the
cadence and regularity of magnetic data was limited. More recent data sources, such as the
multiple-EUV-wavelength images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the
regular and high-cadence magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI),
both on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite, have made it possible to examine

– 3 –

the origins of coronal jets in greater detail. Images from AIA show that, at least in many
cases, the jets originate from the eruption of a small-scale ﬁlament (e.g. Shen et al. 2012;
Liu et al. 2014; Adams et al. 2014; Sterling et al. 2015); following earlier works, we will call
these small-scale ﬁlaments “miniﬁlaments.” Figure 1 shows a schematic of the miniﬁlament-
eruption jet-production process as proposed by Sterling et al. (2015).

This miniﬁlament-eruption picture however was originally developed from observations
of polar coronal hole jets (Sterling et al. 2015). We have recently found the picture also
to hold for quiet Sun coronal jets (Panesar et al. 2016a). Sterling et al. (2016) (Paper 1
hereafter) investigated whether active region jets also typically follow the Figure 1 scenario,
and the ﬁndings were mixed. They observed several jets, and found that at least three of
them showed characteristics of the miniﬁlament-eruption scenario. These three jets were
studied in detail in Paper 1; they showed relatively slow development, with a cool-material
miniﬁlament well-resolved by AIA in time and space as it moved toward eruption and jet
formation. Two of these events made a surge and a spray, but showed either a relatively
weak signature or no obvious signature in available X-ray images (obtained from the Soft
X-ray Imager, SXI; Hinode XRT data not being available). The third slowly evolving jet
did produce a stronger X-ray signature, although still modest compared to other jets. All
three of those three jets could be understood with the miniﬁlament-eruption interpretation
of Figure 1. In addition however, there were several jets that made strong SXI X-ray jets
(originating from region “C” of Fig. 3(a) in Paper 1). Paper 1 did not determine the origin of
those jets because they were fast-developing and/or because their early-development stages
were obscured by surrounding material. In this paper we refer to such fast-developing jets as
“violent” active region jets, to distinguish them from the easier-to-decipher more-gradually-
developing jets that clearly resulted from erupting miniﬁlaments. Paper 1 was however able
to conclude that those violent jets did occur at a neutral line that showed unambiguous ﬂux
cancelation.

Thus, from the Paper 1 study, the question of whether those comparatively violent jets
follow the miniﬁlament-eruption scheme was unresolved. Here we revisit this question by
studying similarly violent jets from a diﬀerent active region. We use a broader range of data
than in the previous study, including images from the Hinode X-ray telescope (XRT) and
from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) instrument, as well as SDO/AIA
and HMI, to assist with trying to unravel the nature of these violent active region coronal
jets.

Instrumentation and Data

For our investigations we use SDO/AIA (Lemen et al. 2012) images in seven EUV wave-
length bands: 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A, and in one UV band: 1600 ˚A.
Each of these channels tends to detect plasma emissions within a limited temperature range
determined by characteristic emission lines around these wavelengths, although in some cases
there can be two or more such characteristic temperatures; see Lemen et al. (2012) for de-
tails. AIA observes the full Sun, has detectors with 0′′.6 pixels, and nominally operates
with a cadence of 12 s in the EUV channels and 24 s in the UV channels. Hinode/XRT
(Golub et al. 2007) has a broadband response in the X-ray range to emissions from plasma
hotter than about 1.0 × 106 K. It has 1′′.02 pixels, and normally observes the Sun with a
limited ﬁeld of view (FOV) and with varying cadences. IRIS (De Pontieu et al. 2014) does
high resolution (0′′.17 pixels) imaging in the UV range with its slit-jaw camera, with four
diﬀerent ﬁlters: 1330 ˚A (C ii, 30,000 K) and 1400 ˚A (Si iv, 65,000 K) with a 40 ˚A bandpass
each, and 2796 ˚A (Mg ii k, 15,000 K) and 2831 ˚A (Mg ii h/k wing, 6,000 K) with a 4 ˚A
bandpass each. For the time period we investigate in Section 4 below, slit-jaw images are
available in all but the 2831 ˚A line.

3. Data Set: Violent Jets in X-rays and in EUV

Our data selection is based on XRT observations from the second-half of the disk passage
of NOAA AR 12259, from 2015 January 13 12:34 UT to January 20 06:30 UT. This is during
a period of “focused mode” observations by Hinode, when relatively-long-term observations
on selected targets are carried out. Although the XRT observations were not completely
continuous over this period, there were long stretches of uninterrupted observations, typically
at a cadence of ∼5 min, although with some periods of higher cadence (30 s). Figure 2 shows
the region in white light, along with a magnetogram. Over this period there were numerous
X-ray jets occurring at the periphery of the region, with the jets tending to cluster in diﬀerent
locations of the region for extended periods of time. In this paper, we will focus on one such
cluster of jets, occurring in the boxed region of Figure 2(a) over 2015 January 13-14.

Figure 3 shows sample XRT images of the region, and the accompanying animation
shows the region over the full period of our observations. XRT had a gap in observations
during the period, with the ﬁrst set of observations running between 13 January 14:34 UT
and 17:44 UT, and the second running nearly uninterrupted between 14 January 06:16 UT
and 16 January 09:43 UT. For our investigations, we cut oﬀ this second block at 14 January
22:34 UT, because the jetting in the Figure 3 FOV largely ends around that time. From the
animation accompanying Figure 3, one can see that the jets happened in the three subregions,

– 5 –

R1, R2, and R3 of Figure 3.

For the study of this paper, we examined jets occurring in the FOV of Figure 3 over
the time period from 2016 January 13 14:30 UT to January 14 23:35 UT. We discuss in
most detail (see Sect. 4 onward) jets of the R2 region for a more restricted period, on 2016
January 14 from 12:35 UT to 22:35 UT, when that region was particularly jet productive.

Figure 4 shows the three jetting regions in AIA EUV 193 ˚A and AIA 94 ˚A images,
with and without overlaid HMI magnetograms. We also include accompanying two-minute-
cadence movies that, diﬀerent from the XRT movies of Figure 3, are uninterrupted over
the entire time period of our observations. From these movies we can see that jets occur
nearly continuously throughout the period, although there still is a quieter period on Jan 14
between about 16:00 UT and 17:20 UT, as is also apparent in the XRT movie.

Figure 5 shows an intensity lightcurve from the AIA 94 ˚A channel over the observation
period, where we have integrated the intensity at each timestep over the FOV of the Figure 3
and Figure 4 images; thus this lightcurve shows the intensity variations over R1, R2, and R3
regions of Figure 3. If XRT had the cadence of AIA, some of the jets seen by AIA would
undoubtedly have been detected by XRT in-between the times of some of those visible in
the XRT animation accompanying Figure 3.

Unlike the active region jets of Paper 1, most jets of this study were not clearly identi-
ﬁable in the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux plots. This is largely due to a somewhat higher GOES
background for these events; for the times of our events here the background is very near
the C1 level, while for the events of Paper 1 the average background was at the high-B level.
Additionally, at least one other region, AR 12257 at the west limb, was very active during
this period, which might contaminate GOES emissions near the time of our identiﬁed jets.
Two events identiﬁed by NOAA as ﬂares that are likely in the base of our jets are a C1.6
and a C1.9 event at 01:54 UT and 10:38 UT, respectively, on 2015 January 14.

It is apparent from the 193 ˚A animation accompanying Figure 4(a) that fan loops that
emanate from the sunspot on the south edge of the ﬁgure obscure much of the jet activity,
making it diﬃcult to see the locations of origin of many of the jets. Also, absorbing material,
frequently retracting jet material, sometimes obscures observations of the jets; Paper 1 also
identiﬁed this as a diﬃculty with trying to observe the origin of some of their jets.

Overlaying HMI magnetograms onto the images (Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)) shows that there
is a mixture of polarities in the region. Overall, the dominant polarity is negative, but there
are three islands of positive polarity, the minority polarity of the region. These three mixed-
polarity regions coincide with the three X-ray-bright areas of Figure 3: R1, R2, and R3, and
are the source of the bulk of the jets of the region over the time period covered by the movies

– 6 –

accompanying Figures 3 and 4. In the following we will ﬁrst consider a set of jets occurring
in region R2, and then we will consider examples of jets from the other locations.

4. Homologous Violent Jets from Subregion R2

Subregion R2 of Figure 3 shows particularly substantial jetting activity on January 14,
with many of the jets apparently homologous. We ﬁrst examine in detail a jet episode
of January 14 that begins in XRT images near 14:40 UT. We select this particular event
because we had excellent coverage of it; in addition to AIA and HMI data, we also have
available IRIS slit-jaw images and high-cadence (∼30 s) XRT images.

Figure 6 shows the jet region. Over the period of the high-cadence AIA movies accom-
panying Figure 6(a), there is actually a sequence of several repeated jets around the time
of the strong one near 14:40 UT. From the animation accompanying Figure 6(a), each jet
begins at an isolated location that becomes the eastern edge of the jet, near (x,y)=(85,-150).
A very weak jet starts at 13:50 UT and continues for about 7 min. Another starts from
the same location at ∼14:07:11 UT, with the emission from that developing jet remaining
conﬁned to a location with narrow extent in the east-west direction. It then however spreads
toward the west with time, ﬁrst gradually and then relatively explosively from 14:17 UT,
and reaches a maximum extent of ∼15′′ at about 14:30 UT. As this jet episode is fading,
the above-mentioned jet that starts at 14:40 UT in X-rays begins; in the AIA videos, its
initial brightening starts at about 14:32 UT at the eastern location. It starts to broaden
markedly from about 14:41 UT, reaches a maximum extent near 14:48 UT, and then fades.
A new feature then brightens from 14:52 UT, but it is from a diﬀerent origin site, and so
is not homologous with the three events just described. But a new event, homologous with
those three earlier events, does start at about 15:02 UT, although it is heavily obscured by
foreground opaque material; it has a more complicated development that is still continuing
as the Figure 6(a) high-cadence movie ends at 15:40 UT.

Figure 6(b) shows the magnetogram of the region, and Figure 6(c) shows an IRIS 1400 ˚A
image of part of the FOV of the images in the earlier two panels. Figures 6(d)—6(f) show the
IRIS image at three diﬀerent times with the magnetogram contours overlaid. This sequence
begins in Figure 6(d) with the above-mentioned event that started in AIA at 14:32 UT. It
is clear that the eastern edge of the event is lodged into the neutral line between polarities
B3 and B4 in Figure 6(d), with negative/positive polarities on the east/west side of the
originating jet. On its southern edge the jet may again be bounded by a less-well-deﬁned
neutral line that includes the positive ﬂux clump labeled B6 in Figure 6(d). Figure 6(f)
shows the jet at near its maximum extent; at this time its western edge is lodged in a region

– 7 –

of negative polarity.

We can make a direct comparison between the IRIS-observed jet and magnetograms
in Figures 6(d)—6(f), and the jet schematic of Figure 1. In both the schematic and in the
observations, the dominant polarity is negative and the minority polarity is positive. In the
schematic, the jet starts between the respective negative and positive polarities “A” and “B”
of Figure 1(c), and then in time the jet spreads horizontally out to polarity “C.” Similarly,
in the observations, the jets starts between B3 and B4 (Fig. 6(d)), and spreads out to the
location of B5 (Fig. 6(f)). Therefore, the observations of this active region jet are broadly
consistent with the schematic of Figure 1, which was drawn based on observations of coronal
hole jets. We also inspected other available IRIS slit-jaw wavelengths for this event, and
they are consistent with what we ﬁnd from the 1400 ˚A images.

One question about this comparison between these violent active region jet observations
and the Figure 1 schematic however is whether there is a miniﬁlament that erupts from the
Figure 6(d) B3—B4 neutral line to form the jet, as presented in the Figure 1 schematic. In
AIA EUV images, for the jet episode beginning at about 14:07 UT, we can identify strands
of absorbing material erupting from the B3—B4 neutral line. One such strand is touched by
∼2′′. A similar such
the tip of the black arrow in the 171 ˚A image in Figure 6(a); it has width <
strand is discernible in a subsequent jetting episode in the video accompanying Figure 6(a)
at times around 14:41:23 UT. When viewed against the disk however, ﬁlament material is
apparently diﬃcult to see in IRIS slit-jaw images, reportedly being semi-transparent and
optically thin in 1330 ˚A and 1400 ˚A images (Li & Zhang 2016). Consistent with this, we see
no absorbing ﬁlament material at those slit-jaw wavelengths, nor do we see any such material
in the 2796 ˚A slit-jaw images. Nonetheless, the AIA 171 ˚A (and also 193 ˚A) observations
are suggestive of ejections of cool miniﬁlament material in narrow, long strands. While these
features are only marginally apparent here, we will show cases below (Section 5) where thin
ﬁlament-like strands appear more clearly than here.

Also to be consistent with the Figure 1 schematic, a JBP should occur along the B3—B4
neutral line. We identify candidate brightenings in AIA 94 ˚A images (video accompanying
Fig. 4(b)), e.g. at 14:16:01 UT and again at about 14:40:01 UT and about 15:16:01 UT in
the video accompanying Figures 4(b) and 4(d). This brightening is also apparent in X-rays,
e.g. on Jan 14 at 14:20:52 UT, 14:44:32 UT, and at 15:19 UT in the video accompanying
Figure 3; the location of this brightening matches that of the JBP in the Figure 1(b)—1(c)
schematic. Our observed candidate brightenings however are soon superseded in brightness
by neighboring loops rooted in stronger magnetic ﬁelds.

Similarly, we expect new bright loops connecting the miniﬁlament-eruption location, i.e.
the minority-polarity ﬂux near the B3—B4 neutral line, with the majority-polarity roots of

– 8 –

the neighboring larger loop in the Figure 1 schematic, at the times of Figures 1(c) and 1(d).
Such connections are repeatedly identiﬁable in the AIA 94 ˚A video accompanying Fig-
ures 4(b) and 4(d) at, e.g., on Jan 14 around 14:26:01 UT, 14:46:01 UT, and at 15:26:01 UT,
respectively with the brightenings listed in the previous paragraph. These connections also
are apparent in the IRIS image in Figure 6(f), where the jet intensity brightenings clearly
extend from the positive-polarity side of the B3—B4 neutral line to the B5 negative-polarity
region. In each of these cases, the lateral extent of bright emitting jet material expands to
cover the approximate extent of the base region, consistent with the shadings in Figure 1(c)
and 1(d).

This spire expansion with time is also apparent in the XRT X-ray video accompanying
Figure 3, especially for the higher-cadence observations of the jet over 14:41 UT—14:51 UT,
and thus conforms to the deﬁnition of blowout jets presented in Moore et al. (2010, 2013).
Moreover, a prediction of the miniﬁlament-eruption scenario is that the jet spire should move
away from the JBP location with time (Sterling et al. 2015); this direction of movement is
clearly visible in the XRT movie (and other movies) for this jet.

We conclude that for the time interval of the IRIS movie of Figure 6 (approximately
14:48 UT—15:25 UT on Jan 14), in most respects the jets originating at the B3—B4 neutral
line (labeled in Fig. 6(d)) follow the schematic of Figure 1. Possible diﬀerences however
are that the emission at the expected JBP is soon dominated in brightness by emissions
from neighboring stronger-ﬁeld loops. Also, we are not able to determine unambiguously
whether there is a cool-material miniﬁlament ejected at the start of the eruption. We do
observe narrow strand-like absorbing features near the AIA spatial-resolution limit, that
are embedded/entrained in bright jetting material, and could be an erupting miniﬁlament.
We next consider other jets in the same active region where such strands unambiguously
participate in the jet development in the manner depicted in Figure 1.

5. Violent Jet Eruptions Displaying Obvious Erupting Miniﬁlaments

In Section 4 we focused on events for which we had the best mutual coverage among
XRT and IRIS, in addition to AIA and HMI. Those jets however did not show clearly
an accompanying miniﬁlament eruption. Many other jets however occur among the three
bright areas of this active region depicted in Figure 3. From the low-cadence AIA 193 ˚A video
accompanying Figure 4(a), we can identify several cases where we can discern miniﬁlaments
erupting in step with the jet more clearly than in the examples of Section 4.

Figure 7 shows two such jets; although XRT and IRIS data are not available at these

– 9 –

times, we present AIA 193 ˚A images in Figure 7 and 12 s-cadence images in the accompanying
animations. There are two successive jet eruptions, respectively starting at ∼01:34 UT and
at ∼01:50 UT.
in this case the jets originate from subregion R1, and speciﬁcally from the
B1—B2 neutral line and spread out to the B3 polarity (Fig. 7(d); see Fig. 6(d) for labels).
This is in contrast to the situation in Figure 6, where the jets originated in subregion R2, and
speciﬁcally from the B3—B4 neutral line, and spread out to the B5 polarity. That is, for the
events of both Figures 6 and 7, the jets form with a positive-ﬂux minority-polarity setup. In
the Figure 6 case that positive polarity is B4, and in the Figure 7 case that positive polarity is
B2. Thus in Figure 7, in comparing with the labeling of the Figure 1(c) schematic, locations
B1, B2, and B3 correspond to locations “A,” “B,” and “C” of the schematic, respectively.

Polarities of these subregions however are rapidly evolving. So at the time of Figure 7
the positive-polarity patch labeled B4 in Figure 6(d) has not yet formed, and by the time of
Figure 6 the negative-polarity patch labeled B1 in Figure 7(d) is no longer present. We will
discuss these rapid evolutionary magnetic changes in Section 6 below.

In contrast to the events of Section 4, here we can discern clearly an erupting miniﬁla-
ment in the magnetic eruption that drives each jet. From the Figure 7(a) video, this miniﬁl-
ament becomes discernible from the background dark material from about 01:29:06 UT. It
then “crawls up” the neighboring mound-like bright region, corresponding to the time pe-
riod between the schematics in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), until about 01:31:42 UT.
It then
starts moving (approximately) radially outward from the surface along what is to become
the jet spire; this upturn in the miniﬁlament’s trajectory occurs at a time corresponding
to that between the schematics in Figures 1(c) and 1(d). In the animation accompanying
Figure 7(a), dark material from the outward-moving miniﬁlament quickly becomes engulfed
in surrounding hotter jet material; this hotter material, represented by the shaded regions in
Figures 1(c) and 1(d), is expected to form when ﬁeld enveloping the ﬁeld threading the cool
miniﬁlament material undergoes external reconnection with far-reaching ﬁeld of the majority
polarity, which is negative in both the observations and in the schematic. As with the jet of
Figure 6, in this case the jet spire also starts out relatively narrow (e.g., at 01:35 UT), but
then expands to span much of the mound-like bright region (e.g., at 01:37 UT), corresponding
to the situation of the schematic in Figure 1(d). Again, in accordance with that schematic,
the expansion is in a direction away from where the miniﬁlament originally resides prior to
its eruption.

For the second jet in the movie of Figure 7, the ﬁlament is even more obvious, ﬁrst

appearing at about 01:45:06 UT, and starting to erupt upward from about 01:50:18 UT.

These miniﬁlaments appear to be strands of width <

∼2′′. This is the same size range we
inferred for jets of Figure 6 also, but they are much more obvious (darker) for these Figure 7

– 10 –

events. This could possibly be due to a better perspective in this case; here we are viewing
region R1 instead of R2, allowing us to see more of the miniﬁlaments as they crawl up the
neighboring mound-like regions. Another factor could be that in the case of Figure 7 we
can see the miniﬁlaments before much of the external reconnection occurs between the ﬁeld
enveloping the miniﬁlament and the surrounding coronal ﬁeld; the hot emissions from that
reconnection tend to create very bright jet-spire and large-lobe-loop material that blinds our
view of the cooler material.

We have also inspected 12 s-cadence AIA 94 ˚A images of this same event in order to
conﬁrm the location of the JBP, but the ﬁndings regarding this are equally apparent in the
193 ˚A images of Figure 7 and its accompanying video, and thus we do not include the 94 ˚A
images for this case. Based on the schematic of Figure 1, we expect the JBP to occur at
the B1—B2 neutral line. For the ﬁrst of the two jetting episodes, there is only very weak
brightening in 193 ˚A at this location at about 01:20:54 UT. For the second jet episode,
brightening at this neutral line (e.g., over approximately 01:48 UT—01:52 UT) is a little
stronger than in the ﬁrst episode.

In both episodes however, the strongest base brightening occurs ∼5′′—10′′ further to the
west of the B1—B2 neutral line from which the miniﬁlament strand originates. For the ﬁrst
jet episode this strongest brightening is at about 01:37:30 UT. For the second jet episode, at
the time of the strongest brightenings the images are too saturated to make a reliable match
to the magnetogram, but at, e.g., 02:18 UT, it is clear that the main base brightening is west
of the B1—B2 neutral line. In both cases, these brightenings are strongest at about the time
the miniﬁlaments lift oﬀ radially away from the surface. For these jets, B2 is a strong positive
polarity, and it is surrounded by other negative elements in addition to B1, including the
negative-polarity patch B3, and negative patches north, south, and southeast of B3. These
brightening locations are consistent with them being intense newly-formed loops from the
external reconnection of the envelope of an erupting miniﬁlament ﬂux rope, corresponding
to the red loop connecting polarities B and C in Figure 1(c); they are particularly bright
because the ﬂux elements in which those loops are rooted are particularly strong.

Another possibility is that the strong brightenings west of the B1—B2 neutral line is
actually a secondary-jet-causing eruption, triggered by the ﬁlament eruption from the B1—
B2 neutral line. In that case, that brightening would form the JBP for another jet, with the
neutral line of that JBP being between the positive patch B2 in Figure 7(d) and negative
polarity south of B2 (and thus these would correspond respectively to B and A in Fig. 1(c)),
and the larger lobe ﬁeld would be formed by B2 and the negative ﬁeld north and east of B2
(these would correspond respectively to B and C in Fig. 1(c)).

Which, if either, of these explanation explains the strong intensity of the loops west

– 11 –

of the B1—B2 neutral line would require more investigation to determine with conﬁdence;
those investigations are beyond the scope of the present study.

We present one more example where we can identify an erupting miniﬁlament, this
time for an eruption occurring in region R3 of Figure 3. IRIS data are not available for this
event. We do not present separate AIA high-cadence movies of this event, but from the video
accompanying Figure 4(c), over January 14 10:22 UT—10:36 UT there is a miniﬁlament (of
width ∼5′′) moving in the southwest direction away from the neutral line north and east of
positive magnetic clump labeled B7 in Figure 6(d). Subsequently this miniﬁlament erupts
outward, apparent in the video from 10:36 UT to 10:42 UT. From Figure 4(d), and its
accompanying video at 10:38 UT, we see brightenings at the approximate location of the
neutral line from where the miniﬁlament erupted. Again the brightest location is shifted
somewhat, in this case to the southern portion of the neutral line where the ﬁelds along
that neutral line are strongest; but the brightening also extends further west of that neutral
line, on top of the central portion of the B7 positive-polarity clump and negative ﬁeld to its
south. Similar brightenings are visible in X-rays in the XRT video accompanying Figure 3,
over 10:36 UT—10:37 UT. Subsequently, the western brightening becomes extremely intense
(apparent after saturation has subsided in the Fig. 3 XRT video at 10:53:46 UT). This again
could be a very bright loop from the external reconnection, rooted in strong ﬁeld.

6. Magnetic Field Evolution

From the above observations, apparently the factor responsible for the jetting occurring
in the regions labeled R1, R2, and R3 in Figures 3(a) and 4(c) is the presence of the minority-
polarity positive regions in the overall dominant-polarity negative ﬁeld in the northwest
portion of the active region. This is in accord with the general picture for jets presented in
the schematic of Figure 1. Next we examine the evolution of the magnetic ﬂux patches over
a period of jetting in subregion R2.

From the video accompanying Figure 6(b), we see that rapid evolutionary changes,
including ﬂux emergence and ﬂux cancelation, are occurring throughout the observation
period. In order to make tractable investigation of the relationship between the magnetic
changes and the jets, we limit our focus to the period when jetting is concentrated in region
R2 of Figure 3; based on, e.g., the Figure 6 video, we see that the time window on 2015
January 14 over 12:35 UT—22:35 UT contains most of these R2 jets.

Figures 8(a) and 8(b) display the magnetic evolution over the time period, where the
top two panels corresponding to the two parallel rectangular boxes in Figure 6(b), with

– 12 –

Figures 8(a) and 8(b) respectively corresponding to boxes (b1) and (b2) in Figure 6(b).
Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show distance-time plots, where the vertical-axis distance runs along
the x′ axis in Figure 6(b), and the plotted quantity is the sum of the signed ﬂux in the
y′ direction: R B dy′. These Figure 6(b) boxes were selected and oriented so that we could
follow the evolution at the source neutral line for the jets of region R2 of Figure 3, and
also so that the x′ direction would approximately be aligned with the drift direction of the
positive-polarity clumps. We selected these two boxes rather than a single box covering the
full area of b1+b2, because the positive ﬂux of this R2 area approximately splits into two
diﬀerent clumps, each approximately contained in one of these two boxes, over the time
period of Figure 8; one can see this from the animation accompanying Figure 6(b), which
It is nonetheless hard

to isolate the white ﬂux completely over the full time range of Figure 8 and still show the
features that we wish to highlight. Thus there is some drift of positive ﬂux into box (b1) over
16:30 UT—18:30 UT; this increases the value of the positive ﬂux contribution to the integral
over dy′, and this accounts for a modest increase in the white intensity in the Figure 8(b)
plot over this time.

Figure 8(c) shows the integrated intensity as a function of time of the blue box of
Figure 6(b), and shows peaks at times of jet brightenings originating from region R2 of
Figure 2. There is a cluster of jetting between about 13:45 UT and 15:45 UT, and a weaker
cluster between about 20:00 UT and 22:30 UT, with the times indicated by the blue and
magenta line pairs; these clusters of jets at the R2 location are apparent in the movies
accompanying Figure 4. Both of these cluster times correspond to times of unmistakable
ﬂux cancelation at the main neutral line of region R2 in Figure 4(c), as can be seen by
referencing the colored-line pairs in Figures 8(b).

A strong jet near 19:00 UT in Figure 8(c) corresponds to cancelation visible in Fig-
ure 8(a), highlighted by pairs of orange lines in both panels. This cancelation does not stand
out as much as those in Figure 8(b); examining the movie accompanying Figure 6(b) shows
that this is because, even though ﬂux cancelation occurs at the neutral line, a strong positive
ﬂux element still remains immediately adjacent to the canceling neutral line. In summary,
all of the main jets of this R2 subregion occur at the sites of ﬂux cancelation.

Figure 9 shows the change with time of the total positive-polarity ﬂux in each of the two
boxes of Figure 6(b). Since some positive ﬂux does enter into the box with time, we cannot
trust in detail the ﬂux changes over all times, due to the aforementioned positive-ﬂux drifts
into the boxes; but this eﬀect seems to be small even over the time of the most obvious such
drift into the box, 16:30 UT—18:30 UT. From the movie accompanying Figure 6(b), drifts
of positive ﬂux out of the boxes (b1) and (b2) appear to be even less extreme. Cancelation

– 13 –

in box (b1) corresponds to the times of enhanced jetting activity over approximately 14:00—
16:00 UT (blue lines in Figs. 8 and 9) and over approximately 21:00—23:30 UT (magenta
lines), and cancelation in box (b2) corresponds to the jet near 19:00 UT (orange lines).
(Although prominent in AIA images, that 19:00 UT jet was not observed by XRT due to a
gap in the observations.) Therefore these plots conﬁrm our interpretation above that ﬂux
cancelation is taking place near the times of the jets.

We see in Figure 9(a) a rate of ﬂux decrease of ∼0.5×1019 Mx hr−1 for about an
hour around the time period where there is one outstanding jet in the AIA 94 ˚A inten-
sity plot of Figure 8(c). For the period over 14:00—15:00 UT in Figure 9(b) the drop rate is
∼1.5×1019 Mx hr−1, and from Figure 8(c) we see that over that same time period (14:00—
15:00 UT) there are about three main intensity peaks. (Especially for this 14:00—15:00 UT
time window, we suspect that some cancelation is still occurring at the times when jets occur
just before or after the times where the ﬂux is dropping in Fig. 9(b), but that ﬂux drop is not
well-captured by the restricted box region of Fig. 6(b) we used to make that ﬂux plot. This is
why the blue lines in Figs. 8 and 9 cover a wider time window than just 14:00—15:00 UT for
these jets.) From the videos accompanying Figures 4 and 6, the smaller peaks of Figure 8(c)
over this time period are due to weaker jet events and/or secondary events. For the ∼21:00—
22:30 UT period, there is a drop in ﬂux with a rate of ∼1.8×1019 Mx hr−1, and over this
time there are about three main jetting episodes identiﬁable in the Figure 8(c) light curve.
Therefore we can say that the ﬂux cancelation rates range over (0.5—1.8)×1019 Mx hr−1
for the active region jets that we observe over this R2 region over the period we examined.
The average cancelation rate weighted by the number of jets at each of the above rates is
(1.5 ± 0.5) × 1019 Mx hr−1, based on an average of about seven violent active region jets.

From this, we can estimate the amount of ﬂux going into the buildup to each of these
stronger jets (i.e., the jet activity corresponding to the three peaks in the Fig. 8(c) light
curve). For the three such jets of the 14:00—15:00 UT 1-hr time window, this averages to
∼5×1018 Mx. Similarly, for the three such jets the 21:00—22:30 UT 1.5-hr time period, the
average is ∼4×1018 Mx, and for the single jet of the ∼1-hr time period of the Figure 9(a)
jet the average is also ∼(4—5)×1018 Mx. So we can say that roughly ∼5×1018 Mx of ﬂux
cancels prior to each of these stronger jet episodes. At least for subregion R2, upon which
we performed the detailed analysis above, the jetting episodes continue until all of the clump
of minority ﬂux disappears.

7. Energetics

From the above-estimated amount of ﬂux canceled prior to each of the jet episodes, we
can make a rough estimate of the amount of energy in our active region violent jets, assuming
that they are produced via erupting ﬂux ropes as in the Figure 1 schematic.

We begin by estimating the size of the ﬂux rope. We have already noted that the width
∼2′′; so let’s take a width 2r of 2′′. Figure 6(d) shows the
of the erupting ﬁlament strands is <
length of the B3—B4 neutral line to be ∼10′′; we take this to be the length, l, of the ﬂux rope,
resulting in a ratio l/r ∼ 10 for the ﬂux rope. From this, we can derive a cross-sectional area,
A, of the ﬂux rope to be πr2 ∼ 1.7×1016 cm2, and volume, V, to be πr2l ∼1.2×1025 cm3.

We estimate the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, of the ﬂux rope by assuming that the total
ﬂux ﬂux accumulated for each jet calculated above, 5×1018 Mx, ﬂows through the area of the
ﬂux rope, so that the total ﬂux is BA. Taking that area to be the value A we estimated for
the ﬂux rope cross section, this yields B ∼ 300 G. This might be considered a rough estimate
for B, considering that the ﬂux rope would be expected to form nearer to the photosphere
than at the time we observe erupting strands in the AIA images, and hence it would be
more compact than what we calculated above, reducing A and increasing B somewhat; and
on the other hand the true ﬂux rope may have a cross-sectional area larger than that of the
strand, for example if the strand has an enveloping cavity around it, reducing B somewhat.
For an approximate upper limit for B, we use the value of the positive-polarity magnetic
ﬂux clumps that we measure from the magnetograms, such as B4 in Figure 6(d), where we
ﬁnd maximum values in the range 300 G—500 G. Thus we can consider a range for B of
the ﬂux rope to be approximately <

∼300—500 G.

Using B = 300 G gives a magnetic energy in the ﬂux rope Ef r = V (B2/8π) ≈ 4.3 ×
1028 erg. Using our upper estimate for B would increase this by a factor of 3. Keeping
in mind our caveats for our B values, we estimate the energy contained in the erupting-
miniﬁlament ﬂux rope of the Figure 1 schematic to be ∼1028 erg — 1029 erg for the violent
jets. Deductions from observations of jet energy values range over 1025 erg —1029 erg (e.g.
Shibata et al. 1992; Shimojo & Shibata 2000; Pucci et al. 2013; Raouaﬁ et al. 2016), and so
our derived estimate of ﬂux rope energies is suﬃcient even for the greatest of these.

8. Summary and Discussion

We have examined a series of active region coronal jets, bright in X-rays and fast-evolving
(“violent”), like the ones that were diﬃcult to analyze in Paper 1. We ﬁnd that the jets
tend to occur in localized regions, which we initially identiﬁed in XRT soft X-ray images and

– 15 –

which we have labeled R1, R2, and R3 in Figure 3. Magnetograms show that each of these
regions is broadly consistent with the schematic of Figure 1, where in each of R1, R2, and
R3 there is a positive-polarity island butting up against a negative-polarity region, within
a generally-negative-polarity larger region; that is, the positive and negative polarities are
respectively the minority and majority polarities in the overall region. Figure 1 was initially
drawn to describe jets in coronal-hole regions (Sterling et al. 2015), but recently we have
found that it applies to jets in quiet Sun regions (Panesar et al. 2016a), and also to at least
relatively-slowly-developing active-region coronal jets (Paper 1). Here we conﬁrm that the
same general picture also applies to at least many of the violent active region jets. We
also found that cancelation occurs at the neutral line on which the jet activity commences,

comparison with some other jets however, when detectable, miniﬁlaments often appear as

in jets in coronal holes and quiet regions.

We also found that loops neighboring the JBP can be more intense than the JBP. This
phenomenon has however also been seen in some coronal hole jets (Moore et al. 2013), and
therefore is not limited to the violent jets studied here. How this ﬁts with the picture of the
Figure 1 schematic (e.g. whether they form the JBP for a secondary jet) is a topic for later
consideration.

In Figure 6 we examined in detail the set of jets occurring in the R2 region. High-cadence
AIA EUV images and IRIS UV images overlaid with HMI magnetograms corroborate that the
jets start with brightenings roughly along a strong-gradient neutral line between the minority
and majority ﬂuxes, that the minority-polarity region is linked by bright-loop extensions to
farther-away majority-polarity regions, that the jet forms above this mixed-polarity setup,
and that the jet spire drifts with time away from the location of the initial neutral-line
brightenings; all of these properties are consistent with the miniﬁlament-eruption schematic
for jet production (Fig. 1).

For this same series of jets in region R2, we follow the magnetic evolution in Figures 8
and 9. We ﬁnd that the jet occurrences cluster around times when the most-prominent ﬂux
cancelation is ongoing, and there are few strong jets (meaning those showing in the AIA 94 ˚A
lightcurve of Fig. 8(c)) outside of those cancelation times. Thus, our results are consistent
with the jets resulting from magnetic ﬂux cancelation: when the strong cancelation episodes
stop, the strong jetting stops. This is also consistent with recent ﬁndings for individual
jets (e.g. Hong et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2012; Adams et al. 2014; Young & Muglach 2014a,b;
Zhang & Ji 2014), and with recent ﬁndings examining multiple jets (e.g., Chen et al. 2015a,b;
Panesar et al. 2016a). Other studies (e.g. Innes & Teriaca 2013) observe jet-like phenomena

– 16 –

originating from sites of network-ﬁeld cancelation. Shelton et al. (2015) report jets resulting
from ﬂux emergence, although the ﬂux changes provided in their ﬁgures also show ﬂux
decreases near the time of jet brighting, and so ﬂux cancelation as the source of the jets in
that case is not ruled out.

In some cases, jets do occur from locations of ﬂux emergence. But for at least many of
these cases, close examination shows that it is the cancelation of one pole of this emerging
bipole with a nearby majority-polarity ﬂux clump that results in the jet (e.g. Shen et al.
2012). Our active regions events here, and also those of Paper 1, also contain cases where ﬂux
emergence occurs, but as with Shen et al. (2012) the jets originate from the cancelation sites.
In active regions especially, it is often diﬃcult to separate emergence from cancelation, since
both occur frequently during some times of the region’s life. In quiet Sun regions, cancelation
consistently seems to be the source of the jets (Panesar et al. 2016a), even though in most
cases the ﬂuxes involved are long past their emergence phase. This leads us to suspect that,
at least in many cases, cancelation is the fundamental magnetoconvection process responsible
for the pre-eruption buildup and triggering of jets, even in active regions. It is conceivable
that cancelations at much smaller rates at the edges of supergranular networks might produce
even smaller scale jets, such as spicules (Sterling & Moore 2016).

As mentioned above, compared to many of the violent jets in active regions, miniﬁla-
ments were easier to identify in the quiet Sun, coronal hole, and less-violent active-region-jet
cases. For example, from the ﬁgures and animations of Panesar et al. (2016a), the quiet-Sun
miniﬁlament widths near their time of eruption onset are ∼2′′—3′′, and from the ﬁgures and
animations of Paper 1 the miniﬁlaments leading to the weaker coronal jets (but producing
surges/sprays) have widths of ∼3′′—4′′. Here we have found harder-to-detect strands of what
∼2′′ in the eruption that drives the jet,
appears to be cool ﬁlament-like material of widths <
akin to the miniﬁlament eruptions in the less-violent jet eruptions. And in fact, with our
new insights into observing these miniﬁlament strands, we are also able to identify similar
strands in the data for some of the violent jets of Paper 1.

Schmieder et al. (2013) also report observations of many threads along an active region
jet, which may be the same features that we observe. They (Schmieder et al. 2013) suggest
that the strands may not be a fully-erupting “ﬂux rope.” Under this view, it may be that
strands of a lower-laying miniﬁlament structure “peel oﬀ” as strands, and erupt to form part
of the jet. In our view this is plausible, whereby the peeling oﬀ would be triggered, somehow,
by the ﬂux cancelation that, from Figures 8 and 9, is clearly cotemporal with bursts of jet
activity.

We found that observing these miniﬁlaments/strands in active region jets is much more
diﬃcult than observing miniﬁlaments in quiet Sun jets that we examined in Panesar et al.

– 17 –

(2016a). As suggested by Figure 7, even in relatively clear cases where we can see the
erupting miniﬁlament strands prior to jet-spire production, they can be hard to see without
zooming in on the jet-base region and using high-cadence images.

Even in cases where we do not observe a miniﬁlament or strand in the active region
jets, we suspect that the same (Fig. 1) process occurs, but the absorbing material is not
detected because of one or more of these reasons:
(a) Its width is too small for us to
resolve.
(b) It is obscured by surrounding dark material. (c) It is surrounded by bright
material resulting from internal reconnection of the legs of the ﬁeld enveloping the erupting
miniﬁlament/strand, producing a bright “cocoon” (Sterling et al. 2011) wrapping around the
erupting miniﬁlament. Similarly, external reconnection between the miniﬁlament/strand-
enveloping ﬁeld and the surrounding (relatively strong) ambient active region coronal ﬁeld
might produce a spire that is particularly bright (shaded regions of Figs. 1(c) and (d)),
obscuring or partially obscuring the cool material.
(d) The eruption may be occurring
without cool material being ejected on the erupting ﬁeld, just as some large-scale ﬂux-rope
eruptions occur without an obvious cool ﬁlament (and some of this bright material may result
from brightening of the erupting (mini)ﬁlament material itself; see, e.g. Su et al. 2015). (e) A
corollary to (d) is that, because the evolution of the magnetic ﬁelds is relatively fast in active
regions compared to non-active regions, there may not be time for enough cool material to
accumulate on a newly-formed ﬂux rope for a substantial miniﬁlament to develop. We do
not know how quickly a (mini)ﬁlament can develop on a ﬂux rope, but at least in the case
of non-active-region ﬁlaments it can take a number of hours (e.g., Berger et al. 2012).

Regarding point (c), our observations do show that in the 304 ˚A images there is a mixture
of brighter and darker strand-like features, and this is consistent with the miniﬁlament
material being partially obscured by brighter material during jet onset in some cases, and
with that darker material enveloped by a brighter shell of material that has undergone
reconnection and/or a bright spire.

Observations by Hong et al. (2016) using the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST)
show high-resolution Hα images of an active region jet location reveal a very narrow (width
∼1′′) miniﬁlament that erupts to form a jet similar to those observed here (cf. Panesar et al. 2016b),
in agreement with the process described in Sterling et al. (2015) (Fig. 1). So erupting miniﬁl-
aments of this size could be the erupting strands we observe. Also, observations by Li et al.
(2015) of an active region jet show that it results when a ﬁlament, clearly visible in the NVST
Hα images, rises up and apparently reconnects with open ﬁeld, with some of the ﬁlament
material ﬂowing out along the newly-open ﬁeld lines. This process also could be responsible
for the source of the erupting miniﬁlament strands that we observe here. Sorting through
these possibilities however is not possible for the cases we present here with the data sets we

– 18 –

use.

In conclusion: We observed X-ray coronal jets at the leading edge of an AR. The jets
were in primarily three localized locations of the region. Those regions were where ﬂux can-
celation occurred, and the jets recurred at those respective locations until all of a clump of
minority ﬂux canceled and disappeared. The overall magnetic setup of all the observed jets
agreed with that of the schematic presented by Sterling et al. (2015), which was originally
drawn to describe coronal jets observed in polar coronal holes, where erupting miniﬁlaments
were found to be the source of the jets. There are however some diﬀerences from the sit-
uation with those coronal hole jets, as well as with coronal jets observed in quiet regions
(which Panesar et al. 2016a, found to behave in a fashion similar to the coronal hole jets):
In the case of AR jets (both here and in the previous study of AR jets in Sterling et al.
2016), clear miniﬁlaments were frequently not apparent, and also the JBP’s intensity was
frequently surpassed by brightenings from diﬀerent enhanced-polarity locations of the jet’s
base. We have put forth some ideas for why these diﬀerences exist. Our educated guess is
that most AR jets work in the same manner as many non-AR jets, with apparent diﬀer-
ences resulting from the environmental circumstances (such as stronger magnetic ﬁelds) or
secondary eruptions/jets. Ultimately, further studies are needed to determine with certainty
whether all coronal jets in all solar regions result from basically the same mechanism, or if
instead there is a fundamental diﬀerence in the way jets of the diﬀerent solar regions can be
produced.

Fig.
1.— Schematic showing jet generation via miniﬁlament eruption, as proposed in
Sterling et al. (2015). This schematic is a modiﬁed version of that in Sterling et al. (2016)
(Paper 1).
(a) A minority-polarity (positive in this example) ﬂux clump sits inside of a
majority-polarity (negative) ambient background ﬁeld. The positive polarity has connec-
tions to immediately-surrounding negative polarity ﬁeld, naturally forming an anemone-
shaped ﬁeld pattern (Shibata et al. 1994) in 3D; these frames show a 2D cross section of the
anemone. Here, the left side of the anemone contains a sheared, non-potential ﬁeld; thus in
2D the structure consists of a small lobe adjacent to a larger lobe in this rendition (situations
on the Sun might change the geometric ratios while maintaining the overall topology). In the
picture, cool ﬁlament material (blue circle) gathers in the sheared ﬁeld above and along this
neutral line, analogous to ﬁlament formation on larger-scale sheared-ﬁeld neutral lines; this
is the miniﬁlament. (b) Initiated by some (unspeciﬁed) trigger mechanism, the miniﬁlament-
carrying ﬁeld (ﬂux rope plus envelope) erupts outward, and travels between the larger lobe
and the ambient ﬁeld. This leads to magnetic reconnection (red X) interior to the erupting
miniﬁlament ﬁeld (internal reconnection), making a ﬂare loop (arcade in 3D) lower in the
atmosphere (red simicircle); we identify this ﬂare arcade with the observed JBP. (c) Upon
reaching the ﬁeld on the far side of the large lobe, the envelope of the erupting miniﬁlament
ﬁeld reconnects with the ambient ﬁeld (right-hand-side red X), making a new open ﬁeld line
(red open ﬁeld line), and a new loop over the large lobe (large semicircular loop); the plasma
on both of these newly-reconﬁgured ﬁeld components is energized via heating and particle
acceleration by the reconnection, and hence represented by the red color. (This is external
reconnection, since it occurs external to the miniﬁlament-ﬂux-rope ﬁeld that is driving the
reconnection. This is also called interchange reconnection, e.g. Crooker et al. 2002.) Plasma
pressure and magnetic force result in acceleration of hot plasma along the newly-opened ﬁeld
(orange shadings); we identify this heated plasma with the observed jet spire. In this frame,
so far only the outer envelope of the erupting miniﬁlament ﬂux rope has undergone this
reconnection, but the ﬁeld threading the cool miniﬁlament material has not, and so only a
hot jet occurs so far. (d) As the miniﬁlament eruption continues, the external reconnection
can eat through the envelope ﬁeld surrounding the cool miniﬁlament material and the open
ﬁeld that threads that miniﬁlament material. This cool material can then escape along that
new open ﬁeld, resulting is a cool (e.g., visible in AIA 304 ˚A images) jet, along side of or
intertwined within the hot jet. Labels “A,” “B,” and “C” are referred to in the text to
compare with magnetic polarities of observed jetting regions.

Fig. 2.— Overview of the jet-productive active region NOAA AR 12259, in SDO/HMI
(a) white-light intensity, and (b) magnetogram images.
In the magnetogram, black and
white represent negative and positive polarities, respectively, with values greater (less) than
1000 G (-1000 G) saturated. The boxed region of (a) is a jet-proliﬁc location over the period

– 22 –

of Hinode/XRT observations over 2016 January 13—14; jets of this study are concentrated
in this region, and this boxed region is the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of Fig. 4 below. For these,
and for all other solar images in this paper, north is up and west is to the right, and the
images have been diﬀerentially rotated to the common time of 2016 Jan 14 16:00 UT .

Fig. 3.— Hinode/XRT X-ray images of the boxed region of Fig. 2(a), with R1, R2, and R3
showing X-ray-bright subregions where multiple jets were concentrated over our observing
period. Two diﬀerent, but essentially homologous jets are occurring in subregion R2 in (a)
and (b). Accompanying animations show that numerous jets occur over the XRT observing
period. XRT was not observing this region over the time gap between 2016 Jan 13 17:44 and
Jan 14 6:16 UT in the animation. (The abscissa in the animation prior to the time jump
was artiﬁcially shifted to reﬂect the 2016 January 14 16:00 UT coordinate location; this was
necessary because that location was outside of the XRT FOV at those observations times.)

Fig. 4.— AIA images of the jetting regions in (a) 193 ˚A and (b) 94 ˚A, and respectively the
same in (c) and (d) but with HMI magnetogram contours overlaid (with overlay times given
in parentheses in the title). Contour levels are at ±30, 50, 100, 750, and 1400 G, where
red and green represent positive and negative polarities, respectively. Labels R1, R2, and
R3 are above (north of) the neutral lines of the correspondingly-labeled regions in Fig. 3.
Animations of these four panels are available.

Fig. 5.— Light curve of the AIA 94 ˚A intensity, integrated over the FOV of Figs. 3 and 4,
at 2 min cadence. Peaks show incidences of ﬂaring, often accompanied by jets, usually
emanating from one or more of the subregions labeled R1, R2, and R3 in Fig. 3.

Fig. 6.— (a) AIA 171 ˚A image of a jet examined in §4, which was one of several homologous
jets occurring in region R2 of Fig. 3. The tip of the black arrow points to a faintly visible
erupting miniﬁlament strand. (b) An HMI magnetogram of the region of (a), with values
greater (less) than 300 G (-300 G) saturated. The dashed lines show the north and west
edges of the FOV of the IRIS images in the subsequent panels. Boxes (b1) and (b2) inside of
panel (b) show regions used to track magnetic development in Figs. 8 and 9, with the (x′,y′)
coordinate system for those two boxes as indicated. The blue rectangle shows the region
over which intensities in Fig. 8(c) are determined. (c) IRIS 1400 ˚A slit-jaw image of the jet
of (a); the FOV is diﬀerent from that of (a) and (b). (d—f) Same as (c), but with HMI
magnetograms overlaid. The title of each of these three panels gives the time of the 1400 ˚A
greyscale image, and in parentheses, the time of the magnetogram. Labels in (d) identify
magnetic ﬂux clumps, and are referred to in the text; a ﬂux clump labeled B1 appears in
Fig. 7, but that clump had disappeared by the time of this image. Animations of panels (a),
(b), (c), and (d—f) are available. The animation corresponding to panel (b) runs twice, the

– 23 –

ﬁrst time with only the magnetogram, and the second time with the boxes (b1) and (b2)
overlaid for the time period corresponding to the plots in Fig. 9.

Fig. 7.— AIA 193 ˚A images showing miniﬁlament “strands” at the start of a pair of jets from
region R1 of Fig. 3, where (a) and (b) show the weaker of the two jets, and (c) and (d) show
the stronger of the two jets. Arrows in (a) and (c) show the miniﬁlament prior to eruption, at
times when they are apparently “crawling up” a magnetic dome that has enhanced emission,
corresponding to the large bipole in the Fig. 1 schematic. In (d), magnetogram contours, with
properties of that in Fig. 4, are overlaid onto the region (with times given in parentheses in
the title). Labels in (d) are as those in Fig. 4(c); region B1 appears here, but has disappeared
by the time of Fig. 4. High cadence (12 s) animations of panels (a—c) and panel (d) are
available.

Fig. 8.— Magnetic evolution over the times of the R2 region (labeled in Fig. 3) jetting. (a)
Evolution in time of the magnetic elements in rectangular box labeled “(b2)” in Fig. 6(a),
where the ordinate is distance along the x′ axis of the rectangular box, and the abscissa is
the net signed magnetic ﬂux from integration along the y′ direction of that rectangular box.
(b) Same as (a), but for the rectangular box labeled “(b1)” in Fig. 6(b). (c) Light curve of
the AIA 94 ˚A intensity, integrated over the blue box in Fig. 6(b), with 2 min cadence; peaks
show the times of substantial jetting activity from region R2. Pairs of same-colored lines
in (c) highlight times of two clusters of jets (blue and magenta), and of a strong single jet
(orange). These correspond respectively to periods of ﬂux cancelation in (b) and (a).

Fig. 9.— Magnetic ﬂux changes with time, of the positive-ﬂux clumps contained in the
regions marked (a) box (b2), and (b) box (b1) in Fig. 6(b). Sharp drops in ﬂux coincide
with periods of increased jetting, as can be seen by comparing the identically-colored line
pairs of Fig. 8(c) with the line pairs in this ﬁgure.
