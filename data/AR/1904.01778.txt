Abstract—Advertisements (ads) often contain strong affective content
to capture viewer attention and convey an effective message to the audi-
ence. However, most computational affect recognition (AR) approaches
examine ads via the text modality, and only limited work has been
devoted to decoding ad emotions from audiovisual or user cues. This
work (1) compiles an affective ad dataset capable of evoking coher-
ent emotions across users; (2) explores the efﬁcacy of content-centric
convolutional neural network (CNN) features for AR vis- ˜a-vis hand-
crafted audio-visual descriptors; (3) examines user-centric ad AR from
Electroencephalogram (EEG) responses acquired during ad-viewing,
and (4) demonstrates how better affect predictions facilitate effective
computational advertising as determined by a study involving 18 users.
Experiments reveal that (a) CNN features outperform audiovisual de-
scriptors for content-centric AR; (b) EEG features are able to encode
ad-induced emotions better than content-based features; (c) Multi-task
learning performs best among a slew of classiﬁcation algorithms to
achieve optimal AR, and (d) Pursuant to (b), EEG features also enable
optimized ad insertion onto streamed video, as compared to content-
based or manual insertion techniques in terms of ad memorability and
overall user experience.

world, and advertisers showcase their products and
services as not only useful, but also highly worthy and
rewarding. Emotions play a crucial role in conveying an
effective message to viewers, and are known to mediate con-
sumer attitudes towards brands [1]–[3]. Emotions are also
critical for spreading public health and safety awareness,
where certain personal choices are portrayed as beneﬁcial to
improving one’s quality of life, while others are portrayed
as deleterious and possibly fatal. Therefore, the ability to ob-
jectively characterize advertisements (ads) in terms of their
emotional content has multiple applications– e.g., inserting
appropriate ads at optimal temporal points within a video

stream can beneﬁt both advertisers and consumers of video
streaming websites such as YouTube [4], [5]. Subjective
experience of pleasantness (valence) and emotional intensity
(arousal) are important affective dimensions [6], and both
inﬂuence responses to ads in distinct ways [7]. Speciﬁcally,
stimulus valence and arousal are known to inﬂuence recall
of images [8], movie scenes [9] and videos [4].

While mining of ad emotions is therefore beneﬁcial, only
a few works have attempted the same. This is despite the
popularity of affective computing recently, and a multitude
of works predicting emotions elicited by image [10], [11],
speech [12], audio [13], music [14] and movie [15], [16] con-
tent. Ad affect characterization is non-trivial as with stimuli
such as music and movie clips [14], [15], [17], [18] as human
emotional perception is subjective. In lieu of detecting of
discrete emotion categories such as joy, sorrow and disgust,
many affect recognition (AR) works model emotions along
the valence (val) and arousal (asl) dimensions [6], [19]. Over-
all, AR methods are broadly classiﬁed as content-centric or
user-centric. Content-centric AR characterizes emotions by ex-
amining textual, audio and visual cues [17], [18]. In contrast,
user-centric AR identiﬁes elicited emotions from facial [20] or
physiological [9], [14]–[16] measurements acquired from the
user or multimedia consumer. While enabling a ﬁne-grained
examination of transient emotions, user-centered methods
may nevertheless suffer from individual subjectivity.

This work expressly studies emotions conveyed by ads,
and employs (i) explicit human opinions and (ii) associ-
ated content and user-centric measurements (or descrip-
tors) which inﬂuence these opinions. Firstly, we examined
the efﬁcacy of 100 diverse, carefully curated ads to co-
herently evoke emotions across viewers. To this end, we
examined the affective ﬁrst impressions of ﬁve experts
and 23 novice annotators and found that the two groups
agreed considerably on the asl and val ratings. Secondly,
we explored the utility of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and domain adaptation for encoding emotional au-
diovisual (i.e., content-based) features. As the compiled ad
dataset is relatively small and insufﬁcient for CNN training,
we employed domain adaptation to transfer knowledge
gained from the large-scale and annotated LIRIS-ACCEDE
movie dataset [21] for decoding ad emotions. Extensive
experimentation conﬁrms that CNN descriptors outperform
handcrafted audio-visual descriptors proposed in [17], with
a substantial improvement observed for val recognition.

Thirdly, we performed user-centric ad AR from EEG

responses compiled from annotators, and found that a three-
layer CNN trained on EEG features produced state-of-the-
art performance for both asl and val recognition. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to perform an explicit
comparison of content and user-centric methods for ad AR.
In addition, we explored the utility of multi-task learn-
ing and feature/decision fusion techniques for asl and val
classiﬁcation. Lastly, we examined if accurate encoding of
ad emotions facilitated optimized insertion of ads onto a
video stream, as ads contribute to revenue generation of
video hosting websites such as YouTube. A study with 18
viewers conﬁrmed that insertion of ads identiﬁed via EEG-
based emotional relevance maximized ad memorability and
viewing experience while watching the ad-embedded video
stream. In summary, we make the following contributions:

1. This is one of the few works to examine AR in ads,
extending ﬁndings reported in [22], [23]. It is also
the only work to characterize ad emotions in terms
of explicit human opinions, and underlying (content-
centric) audiovisual plus (user-centric) EEG features.
2. We present a carefully curated affective dataset of 100
ads and associated affective ratings. Based on statis-
tical analyses, we note that the ad dataset is capable
of evoking coherent emotions across the expert and
novice annotator groups.

3. We examine the utility of CNN-based transfer learn-
ing for AR. We show that CNN features, synthesized
by ﬁne-tuning Places205 Alexnet [24] effectively cap-
tures emotional audiovisual features. Experiments
show that CNN features outperform handcrafted
audio-visual descriptors proposed in [17].

4. We compare and contrast AR achieved with au-
diovisual and EEG-based CNN features. The EEG-
based CNN model best encodes the asl and val
attributes. Also, multi-task learning to exploit feature
similarities among emotionally similar ads consider-
ably beneﬁts ad AR. Finally, probabilistically fusing
estimates of multiple classiﬁers achieves superior AR
than unimodal classiﬁers.

5. We demonstrate how improved AR positively im-
pacts ad memorability and user experience while
watching an ad-embedded video stream. To our
knowledge, this is one of the few works to demon-
strate how improved estimation of ad asl and val
scores can positively impact a computational adver-
tising application.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews
related literature, while Section 3 overviews the compiled ad
dataset and the EEG acquisition protocol. Section 4 presents
the techniques adopted for content and user-centered ad
AR, while Section 5 discusses AR results. Section 6 de-
scribes the user study to establish how improved emotion
estimation facilitates computational advertising. Section 7
summarizes the main ﬁndings and concludes the paper.

2 RELATED WORK
To position our work with respect to the literature and
highlight its novelty, we review the related work examining
(a) affect recognition (b) the impact of affective ads on
consumer behavior (c) computational advertising.

2.1 Affect Recognition

Both content-centric and user-centric approaches have been
proposed to infer emotions evoked by multimedia stim-
uli. Content-centric approaches [17], [18] predict the likely
elicited emotions by examining image, audio and video-
based emotion correlates [17], [23], [25]. In contrast, user-
centric AR methods [14]–[16] estimate the stimulus-evoked
emotion based on physiological changes observed in view-
ers (content consumers). Physiological signals indicative
of emotions include pupillary dilation [26], eye-gaze pat-
terns [9], [27] and neural activity [14], [15], [28]. Both content
and user centric methods require labels denoting stimulus
emotion, and such labels are compiled from annotators
whose affective opinions are deemed acceptable [29], [30],
given that emotion perception is highly subjective. In this
work, we show that a carefully curated set of 100 ads are
assigned very similar emotional labels by two independent
groups comprising experts and novice annotators. Emotional
attribute (i.e., asl and val) labels for these ads are then pre-
dicted via content and user-based methods. User-centered
AR is achieved via EEG signals acquired with a wireless
and wearable Emotiv headset, which is minimally intrusive
and facilitates naturalistic user behavior.

2.2 Emotional impact of ads

Ad-induced emotions inﬂuence consumer behavior signif-
icantly [1], [2]. Work described in [3] concludes that ad-
evoked feelings impact viewers explicitly as well as im-
plicitly, and inﬂuence change in user attitudes towards
(especially hedonistic) products. While many works have
examined the correlation between ad emotions and user
behavior, very few works have exploited these ﬁndings
for developing targeted advertising mechanisms. The only
work that incorporates emotional information for modeling
context in advertising is CAVVA [4], where ad-in-video
insertion is modeled as a discrete optimization problem
based on emotion relevance between video scenes and an
inventory of ads. Based on consumer psychology rules,
video scenes are matched with ads with respect to asl and
val scores to determine (a) the suitable ads for presentation
and (b) optimal ad insertion points that would maximize
user engagement.

Two recent and closely related works [22], [23] discuss
how efﬁcient affect recognition from ads via deep learning
and multi-task learning lead to improved online viewing
experience. This work builds on [22], [23] to show via ex-
tensive experiments that CNNs best encode emotions from
both content and user-centered cues. Also, learning feature
similarities among related stimuli (e.g., high asl, high val
and high asl, low val clips) via multi-task learning (MTL)
can beneﬁt AR in a data impoverished setting involving
only 100 labeled ad exemplars. MTL achieves excellent AR
performance with both audiovisual and EEG descriptors.
Finally, probabilistically fusing the estimates of multiple
classiﬁers (decision fusion) is found to improve AR perfor-
mance over unimodal classiﬁcation. As a demonstration of
how better affect estimation impacts a real-life application,
we show how audiovisual and EEG-based CNN models
enable optimized insertion of ads onto a video sequence

with respect to manual performance via the CAVVA frame-
work [4]. The user study conﬁrms that the EEG-based CNN
model, which achieves the best AR performance, also results
in maximum ad memorability and the best experience for
viewers watching an ad-embedded video stream.

2.3 Computational advertising

Exploiting affect recognition models for commercial appli-
cations has been a growing trend in recent years. The ﬁeld
of computational advertising focuses on presenting con-
textually relevant ads to multimedia users for commercial
beneﬁts, social good or to induce behavioral change. Despite
the fact that ads are emotional, computational advertising
methods have essentially matched low-level visual and se-
mantic properties between video segments and candidate
ads [31] for ad display, ignoring emotional relevance. A
paradigm shift in this regard was introduced by the CAVVA
framework [4], which proposed an optimization-based ap-
proach to insert ads onto video based on the emotional
relevance between the video scenes and candidate ads.
CAVVA employed a content-centric approach to match video
scenes and ads in terms of emotional valence and arousal.
However, this could be replaced by an interactive and user-
centric framework as described in [26]. We explore the use
of both content-centric (via audiovisual CNN features) and
user-centric (via EEG features) methods for formulating an
ad-insertion strategy. A user study shows an EEG-based
strategy achieves optimal user experience and also performs
best with respect to ad memorability. The following section
positions our work with respect to the literature.

2.4 Analysis of related work

Examination of the literature reveals that (1) AR studies are
typically hampered by subjectivity in emotion perception,
and a control dataset that can coherently evoke emotions
in users is essential for effectively learning content or user-
based emotion predictors; (2) Despite the fact that ads are
emotional, and that ad emotions signiﬁcantly impact user
behavior, very little effort has been devoted towards incor-
porating emotional video-ad relevance in a computational
advertising framework.

In this regard, we present the ﬁrst work to compile a
control set of affective ads which elicit concordant opinions
from both experts and naive users. Also, we leverage CNNs
for learning both audiovisual and EEG-based emotion pre-
dictors. Optimal AR is achieved with a CNN classiﬁer
employing EEG features, while CNN-based audiovisual
descriptors outperform handcrafted counterparts proposed
in [17]. Finally, we also demonstrate via a user study how
better affect encoding facilitates ad-to-video insertion via the
CAVVA mechanism [4] to enhance user viewing experience
as well as ad memorability. Details pertaining to our ad
dataset are presented below.

3.1 Dataset Description

The circumplex emotion model [6] deﬁnes valence as the
feeling of pleasantness/unpleasantness and arousal as the
intensity of emotional feeling. Following this deﬁnition, ﬁve
experts carefully compiled a dataset of 100, roughly 1-
minute long commercial ads such that they were uniformly
distributed over the arousal–valence plane (Figure 1). All
the 100 ads are publicly available on video hosting websites,
and an ad was chosen only if there was consensus among
all experts on its valence and arousal labels (categorized as
either high (H)/low (L)). High val ads typically involved
product promotions, while low val ads were awareness
messages depicting the ill effects of smoking, alcohol and
drug abuse, etc. Expert labels were considered as ground-
truth, and used for all recognition experiments in this paper.
We then examined if the compiled ads could serve as
effective control stimuli, i.e., whether they could coherently
evoke emotions across viewers. To this end, the 100 ads were
independently rated by 23 annotators for val and asl upon
familiarizing them with these attributes. All ads were rated
on a 5-point scale, which ranged from -2 (very unpleasant)
to 2 (very pleasant) for val and 0 (calm) to 4 (highly aroused)
for asl. Table 1 presents summary statistics over the four
quadrants. In our dataset, low val ads are longer and are
perceived as more arousing than high val ads implying that
they elicited stronger emotional reactions among viewers.

To assess whether the compiled ads evoked coherent
emotions, we computed agreement among raters in terms
of the (a) Krippendorff’s α, (b) Fleiss κ and (c) Cohen’s
κ scores. The α coefﬁcient is applicable when multiple
raters rate items ordinally. We obtained α = 0.62 (sub-
stantial agreement) and 0.36 (fair agreement) respectively
for val and asl, implying that valence impressions were
more consistent across raters. On a coarse-grained scale, we
computed the Fleiss κ agreement among annotators. The
Fleiss κ statistic (generalization of Cohen’s κ) applies when
multiple raters assign categorical values (high/low in our
case) to items. Upon thresholding each rater’s asl, val scores
by their mean rating to assign high/low labels for each ad,
we observed a Fleiss κ of 0.56 (moderate) for valence and
0.27 (fair) for arousal among raters. Computing Fleiss κ

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING, VOL. ??, NO. ??, JANUARY 1970

upon thresholding each rater’s scores with respect to the
group mean, Fleiss κ values of 0.64 (substantial) for val and
0.30 (fair) for asl were noted. Finally, computing Cohen’s κ
agreement between each annotator and groundtruth labels
(denoting expert opinion), we obtained a mean Cohen’s κ of
0.86 (excellent agreement) and 0.68 (substantial agreement)
across annotators for val and asl respectively. Overall, these
observations convey that (a) greater concordance is noted
among novice raters when their opinions are considered
collectively rather than individually as subjectivity biases
are smoothed out, (b) agreement for val is considerably
higher than for asl and (c) the compiled ads evoke consistent
affective impressions in the annotator and expert groups.

Another desirable property of an affective dataset is the
relative independence of the asl and val dimensions [6],
[32]. To examine asl-val relations for our ad dataset, we
(i) examined scatter plots of the annotator ratings, and (ii)
computed correlations amongst those ratings. The scatter
plot of the mean asl, val annotator ratings, and the dis-
tribution of asl and val ratings are presented in Figure 1.
The scatter plot is color-coded based on expert labels, and is
interestingly different from the classical ‘C’ shape observed
with images [33], music videos [14] and movie clips [15]
attributed to the hypothesis that strong asl evokes strong
val ratings. A close examination of the scatter plot reveals
that a number of ads are rated as moderate asl, but high/low
val. Furthermore, roughly uniform asl and val distributions
are observed resulting in Gaussian ﬁts with large variance,
especially for val. This is plausible as ads are designed to
convey a strong positive or negative message to viewers,
while images and movie scenes may convey a relatively
neutral emotion. Wilcoxon rank sum tests on ratings re-
vealed signiﬁcantly different asl ratings for high vs. low asl
ads (p < 0.0001), and distinctive val scores for high vs. low
valence ads (p < 0.0001) consistent with expectation.

Pearson correlation was computed between the asl and
val dimensions with correction for multiple comparisons
by limiting the false discovery rate to within 5% [34]. This
procedure revealed a negative and insigniﬁcant correlation
of 0.17, implying that ad asl and val scores were largely un-
related. Based on the above ﬁndings, we claim that our 100
ads constitute a control affective dataset as (i) they induce a
fair range of asl and val impressions, which are also found
to be largely independent; Different from the ‘C’-shape char-
acterizing the asl-val relationship for other stimulus types,
asl and val ratings are more uniformly distributed for the
ad stimuli, and (ii) There is fair-to-substantial concordance
among annotators in addition to considerable agreement
between novice raters and the ground-truth on affective la-
bels, implying that our ads evoked fairly coherent emotions
among viewers.

3.2 EEG acquisition protocol

As annotators recorded their emotional ﬁrst impressions on
viewing the ads, we acquired their Electroencephalogram
(EEG) brain activations via the Emotiv wireless headset. The
Emotiv device comprises 14 electrodes, and has a sampling
rate of 128 Hz. To maximize engagement and minimize
fatigue during the rating task, these raters took a break after
every 20 ads, and viewed the entire set of 100 ads over ﬁve

sessions spread over two hours. Each ad was preceded by a
1s ﬁxation cross to orient user attention, and to measure rest-
ing state EEG power used for baseline power subtraction.
Upon ad viewing, the raters had a maximum of 10 seconds
to input their asl and val scores via mouse clicks. Upon ex-
periment completion, the EEG recordings were segmented
into epochs, with each epoch denoting the time window
corresponding to the presentation of the corresponding ad.
Upon elimination of corrupted and aborted recordings, we
obtained a total of 1738 epochs for 23 viewers.

Clean vs Raw EEG Data: From the recorded 1738
epochs, we manually rejected those epochs which contained
head and body movement artifacts. The EEG signal was
band-limited between 0.1–45 Hz, and independent compo-
nent analysis (ICA) was performed to remove artifacts relat-
ing to eye movements, eye blinks and muscle movements.
This process results in the removal of 212 epochs to leave us
with 1526 clean epochs. Hereon, clean EEG data will refer
to the 1526 preprocessed epochs after visual rejection and
ICA, whereas raw EEG data will denote the original 1738
epoch data. We evaluated CNN-based AR performance on
both these sets. The following section describes the content
and user-centered AR techniques.

4 CONTENT & USER-CENTERED ANALYSIS

4.1 Content-centered Analysis

For content centered analysis, we extracted and examined
audio-visual descriptors from the ads to predict the emotion
(in terms of high/low asl and val) they are likely to evoke. To
this end, we employed a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN), and the popular handcoded audio-visual descrip-
tors (such as motion activity, audio pitch, etc.) proposed by
Hanjalic and Xu [17]. CNNs have recently become very pop-
ular for a variety of recognition problems, particularly vi-
sual [35] and audio [36], but require vast amounts of labeled
training data. As our ad dataset comprised only 100 ads,
we ﬁne-tuned the pre-trained Places205 [35] model via the
large-scale and labeled LIRIS-ACCEDE movie dataset [21],
and employed the ﬁne-tuned model to extract emotional
descriptors for our ads. This process is termed as domain
adaptation in machine learning literature.

To synthesize a deep CNN for ad AR, we employed
the pre-trained Places205 model [8] originally designed for
scene understanding. The Places205 CNN is trained using
the Places-205 dataset comprising 2.5 million images involv-
ing 205 scene categories. The Places-205 dataset contains
a wide variety of scenes captured under varying illumi-
nation, viewpoint and ﬁeld of view, and we hypothesized
a coherent relationship between scene perspective, lighting
and the scene emotion. To ﬁnd-tune the Places205 CNN, we
employed the labeled LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset [21] which
contains asl, val ratings for 9800 ≈ 10s long movie snippets.
Our ads, on the other hand, are about a minute long with
individual ads having lengths ranging from 30–120s.

4.1.1 FC7 Feature Extraction via CNNs

For extracting deep audio-visual features, we input to the
Places205 CNN key-frame images for the visual modality,
and spectrograms for audio. We ﬁne-tuned Places205 via the

LIRIS-ACCEDE [21] dataset, and employed this model to
extract high-level features output by the penultimate fully
connected (FC7) CNN layer.

Keyframes as Visual Descriptors: From each video
in the ad and LIRIS-ACCEDE datasets, we uniformly sam-
pled one key frame every three seconds– this enabled extrac-
tion of a continuous video proﬁle for affect prediction. This
process generated a total of 1791 key-frames for our 100 ads.
Spectrograms as Audio Descriptors: Spectrograms
(SGs) shown in Figure 2 are visual representations of the
audio frequency spectrum and have been successfully em-
ployed for AR from music and speech [37]. Speciﬁcally,
transforming the audio content to a spectrogram image
allows for audio classiﬁcation to be treated as a visual
recognition problem. We extracted SGs over the 10s long
LIRIS-ACCEDE clips and consistently from 10s ad seg-
ments. This process generated 610 SGs for our ad dataset.
Following [37], we combined multiple tracks to obtain a
single spectrogram (as opposed to two for stereo). Each
spectrogram is generated using a 40 ms window short time
Fourier transform (STFT), with 20 ms overlap. Larger densi-
ties (denoted by red and yellow shades) of high frequencies
can be noted in the spectrograms for high asl ads, and these
intense scenes are often characterized by high frequency
audio (e.g., sudden loud sounds). Conversely, low asl ads
tend to retain a sense of continuity in the audio proﬁle, and
therefore contain high densities of low frequency sounds.

th

CNN Training for audio-visual features: We used
the Caffe [38] deep learning framework for ﬁne-tuning
Places205 with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 0.0005,
and a base learning rate of 0.0001 reduced by 1
every
10
20000 iterations. We totally trained four binary classiﬁ-
cation networks to recognize high and low asl/val from
audio/visual features. To ﬁne-tune Places205, we used only
the top and bottom 1/3rd LIRIS-ACCEDE videos in terms of
asl and val rankings under the assumption that descriptors
learned for these extreme-rated clips will effectively model
the emotions conveyed by our ads. 4096-dimensional FC7
layer descriptors extracted from the four networks for our
ads were used in the classiﬁcation experiments.

4.1.2 AR with low level audio-visual features

We benchmark AR performance achieved with CNN fea-
tures against the handcrafted features proposed by Hanjalic
and Xu [17]. Even after a decade, their work remains one of
the most popular AR baselines as seen from recent works
such as [14], [15]. In [17], asl and val are modeled via low-
level descriptors describing motion activity, colorfulness,
shot change frequency, voice pitch and sound energy in

the scene. These predictors are intuitive and interpretable,
and are used to estimate time-continuous asl and val levels
in [17]. Table 2 summarizes audiovisual features for content-
centric AR, and the proportion of positive class samples for
val and asl available with audio and video modalities. We
attempt asl/val classiﬁcation at the keyframe/spectrogram
level, and class probabilities are aggregated to obtain ad-
level scores for the application presented in Sec. 6.

4.2 User-centered analysis

The 1738 epochs obtained from the EEG acquisition process
were used for user-centered analysis. However, these epochs
were of different lengths as ad durations were variable.
To maintain dimensional consistency, we performed user-
centric AR experiments with (a) the ﬁrst 3667 samples
(≈ 30s of EEG data), (b) the last 3667 samples and (c) the last
1280 samples (10s of EEG data) from each epoch(consistent
with content-centered analysis, and to examine temporal
effects on AR). Each epoch sample comprised data from
14 EEG channels, and all epoch samples were input to a
classiﬁer upon vectorization. In addition to conventional
classiﬁers, we also used a deep neural network to classify
EEG epochs whose architecture is described below.

4.2.1 EEG Feature Extraction for CNN Training

As we had a relatively small number of epochs (1738) with
very high dimensionality (14 channels × 3667 time points
= 51338 dimensional vector), a CNN trained on this data
is highly susceptible to overﬁtting. To alleviate overﬁtting,
we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
vectorized epochs to reduce dimensionality. PCA has been
successfully employed for CNN-based EEG classiﬁcation
recently [39], [40], and a number of works have stressed the
need for PCA-based pre-processing for robust EEG signal
representation prior to neural network training [41]–[45].
Speciﬁcally, [39] discusses PCA effectiveness for deriving a
good EEG input representation for CNNs.

CNN Training

The
dimensionality-reduced EEG features
(preserving 90%
data variance) were then passed to a CNN for val, asl
recognition. We used a CNN architecture employed for
time-series sensor data classiﬁcation [46] and implemented
with the Keras [47] library. The network is three layers
deep with two 1-D convolutional layers followed by a fully
connected layer. Training was performed with 64 1 × 3
ﬁlters in the 1-D convolutional layers and 128 nodes in the
fully connected layer. We set a momentum factor of 0.9,
weight decay of 0.0005 and a base learning rate of 0.0001.
A dropout level of 0.5 was used to prevent overﬁtting. The
model was trained for a maximum of 100 epochs, and early
stopping was forced in case the validation loss increased
over ﬁve successive training iterations. For both content
and user-centric analysis, 80% of the compiled dataset was
used for training and the remaining 20% for testing with
the process repeated 10 times (10 × 5-fold cross validation).

to assign a binary (H/L) label for asl and val evoked by
each ad, using the extracted fc7/low-level audiovisual/EEG
features. Ad labels are provided by experts, whose opinions
greatly agreed with naive users (Sec 3.1).

Classiﬁers: We considered both shallow and deep
classiﬁers for content and user-centered AR. Among shallow
classiﬁers, we employed linear discriminant analysis (LDA),
linear SVM (LSVM) and radial basis function SVM (RSVM).
LDA and LSVM partition training data via a separating
hyperplane, while RSVM transforms input data onto a high-
dimensional feature space where the positive and negative
class samples can be linearly separated. FC7 features learned
from audiovisual descriptors (Sections 4.1.1 and 4.2.1) were
input to shallow classiﬁers for content-centered analysis,
while EEG descriptors were fed to both shallow classiﬁers
and the three layer CNN for user-centered AR.

In addition to the above single-task learning methods
which do not exploit the underlying structure of the in-
put data, we also explored the use of multi-task learning
(MTL) for AR. When posed with the learning of multiple
related tasks, MTL seeks to jointly learn a set of task-
speciﬁc classiﬁers on modeling task relationships, which
is highly beneﬁcial when learning with few examples.
Among the MTL methods available as part of the MALSAR
package [48], we employed the sparse graph-regularized
MTL (SR-MTL) where a-priori knowledge regarding task-
relatedness is modeled in the form of a graph R. Given
tasks t = 1...T , with Xt denoting training data for task
t and Yt their labels, SR-MTL jointly learns a weight ma-
trix W = [W1 . . . WT ] such that the objective function
(cid:80)T
F is min-
imized. Here, α, β, γ are regularization parameters, while
(cid:107).(cid:107)F and (cid:107).(cid:107)1 denote matrix Frobenius ((cid:96)2) and (cid:96)1-norms.

MTL is particularly suited for dimensional AR, and
one can expect similarities in terms of audio-visual content
among high val or high asl ads. We exploit underlying
similarities by modeling each asl-val quadrant as a task (i.e.,
all H asl, H val ads will have identical task labels). Also,

quadrants with same asl/val labels are deemed as related
tasks, while those with dissimilar labels are considered
unrelated. Task relatedness is then modeled via edge weights
γij for the graph R, i.e., γij = 1 for related tasks, and γij = 0
for unrelated tasks, where i, j ∈ 1 . . . T, i (cid:54)= j.

The graph R then guides the learning of Wt’s as shown
in the three examples in Fig.3, where SR-MTL is fed with the
speciﬁed features computed over the ﬁnal 30 s of all ads.
Darker shades denote salient MTL weights. Shot change
frequency is found to be a key predictor of asl [17], and one
can notice salient weights for H asl, H val ads in particular.
The attributable reason is that our H asl H val ads involve
frequent shot changes to maintain emotional intensity, while
the mood of our H asl, L val ads is strongly inﬂuenced
by semantics (depicting topics like drug and alcohol abuse,
and overspeeding). Likewise, pitch amplitude is a key val
predictor, and salient weights can be consistently seen over
the 30s temporal window for HV ads. Finally, more salient
weights for H val ads with motion activity reveals that our
positive val ads involve accentuated motion.

For content-centric AR, apart from unimodal (audio (A)
or visual (V)) fc7 features, we also employed feature fusion
(A+V entries in Table 3). Probabilistic decision fusion of the
unimodal classiﬁer outputs was attempted with audiovisual
features (A+V DF entries in Table 3), and with audiovisual
and EEG (Audiovisual + EEG DF in Table 5) features.
Audiovisual feature fusion (A+V) involved concatenation
of fc7 A and V features over 10s windows (see Table 2),
while the West technique [49] was employed for decision
fusion (DF). In DF, the test label is assigned the index j,
j ∈ {H(1) ,L(0)}, corresponding to maximum class proba-
bility Pj = (cid:80)2
i tipi, where i denotes the constituent
modalities, pi’s denote classiﬁer posteriors and {α∗
i } are the
optimal weights maximizing test F1-score determined via a
2D grid search. If Fi denotes the training F1-score for the ith
modality, then ti = αiFi/ (cid:80)2

i=1 αiFi for given αi.

i=1 α∗

Metrics and Experimental Settings: We used the F1-
score (F1) deﬁned as the harmonic mean of precision and
recall for evaluation. F1-score is appropriate for our setting
due to the imbalance in the +ve and -ve class proportions.
We compare our audiovisual fc7 and EEG features against
the baseline features of Hanjalic and Xu [17]. These hand-
crafted features are interpretable, and employed to estimate
time-continuous asl and val levels. As the Hanjalic (Han)
algorithm [17] inherently uses audiovisual features to model
asl and val, we only consider (feature and decision) fusion
performance in this case. User-centered AR uses only PCA-
applied EEG features (Sec. 4.2.1). AR results obtained over

ten repetitions of 5-fold cross validation (CV) (50 runs) are
presented. CV is used to address the overﬁtting problem on
small datasets, and optimal SVM parameters are determined
via an inner ﬁve-fold CV on the training set. To examine the
temporal variance in AR performance, we present F1-scores
obtained over (a) all ad frames (‘All’), (b) last 30s (L30) and
(c) last 10s (L10) for content-centered AR. Similarly, AR results
are presented for (a) ﬁrst 30s (F30), (b) last 30s (L30) and
(c) last 10s (L10) for user-centered AR. These settings were
chosen as EEG sampling rate is higher than for audio/video.

5.1 Results Overview

Tables 3 and 4 respectively present content-centric and user-
centric AR results for the various settings described above,

whereas Table 5 presents results on fusing the audiovisual
and EEG-based classiﬁer outputs. The highest F1 score
achieved for a given modality across all classiﬁers and
temporal settings is denoted in bold.

Content-centric analysis: Focusing on unimodal de-
scriptors in Table 3, we note that video fc7 features predict
val (peak F1 = 0.79) considerably better than asl, while audio
fc7 features encode asl (peak F1 = 0.68) slightly better than
val (peak F1 = 0.66). Also, much superior AR is achieved
with MTL (peak F1 = 0.96 for val, 0.94 for asl) as compared
to single task classiﬁers. With single and multi-task classi-
ﬁers, consistently higher F1-scores are noted with video fc7
features, implying that better emotion predictors are learned
from the raw video data as compared to spectrograms.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING, VOL. ??, NO. ??, JANUARY 1970

Concerning multimodal methods, we ﬁrstly note that
multimodal approaches achieve comparable or better F1
scores as compared to unimodal ones. For val, the best
fusion performance (F1 = 0.75 with feature fusion and
RSVM classiﬁer) is superior compared to audio-based (F1
= 0.66), but inferior compared to video-based (F1 = 0.79)
recognition. Contrastingly for asl, fusion F1-score (0.75 with
DF) considerably outperforms unimodal methods (0.68 with
audio, and 0.67 with video). We ﬁrst examine feature-
fusion approaches. Comparing A+V fc7 vs Han features,
fc7 descriptors clearly outperform Han features with both
single and multi-task methods. Performance difference is
prominent for val (F1 = 0.75 with fc7 vs 0.65 with Han),
while comparable recognition is achieved with either feature
for asl (F1 of 0.63 with fc7 vs 0.59 with Han).

Examining AR performance with decision fusion (DF)
methods, DF (F1 = 0.75) substantially outperforms feature
fusion (F1 = 0.59) for asl recognition, while underpeforming
for val (F1 = 0.72 with DF and 0.75 with feature fusion).
Among classiﬁers, RSVM produces the best F1-scores for
both asl and val among single-task classiﬁers with both uni-
modal and multimodal features. This indicates that the fc7
audiovisual features may not be easily linearly separable in
the respective feature spaces. Nevertheless, the linear MTL
model beats all single-task methods with both fc7 and Han
features. MTL F1-scores in the A+V FC7 + MTL condition
are considerably higher than single-task multimodal F1-
scores, and the trend repeats with unimodal features as well.
These observations suggest that learning underlying feature
similarities among ads with similar attributes enables better
separability of H and L asl/val data.

EEG-based AR: From user-centered analysis, we
mainly examine whether (a) better AR is achievable by
examining user responses vis-˜a-vis mining the audiovisual
ad content; (b) the three-layer CNN (Section 4.2.1) better
encodes emotional attributes as compared to shallow clas-
siﬁers, and (c) whether the considered CNN architecture
could achieve similar AR performance with clean vs noisy
EEG signals, as CNNs are adept at learning target encodings
from disparate data.

Observing Table 4, we ﬁrstly observe that EEG-based
AR results are generally superior to content-centric results.
The best EEG-based val and asl F1-scores are considerably
higher than the best content-centered unimodal results. As
with audiovisual features, EEG achieves better val recogni-
tion than asl different from ﬁndings reported in [14]–[16].
In this regard, we observe that positive val is found to
correlate with increased activity in the frontal lobes [50], and
the Emotiv device efﬁciently captures frontal lobe activity
despite its limited spatial resolution.

Among the shallow classiﬁers considered with EEG data,
RSVM again performs best. The three-layer CNN however
outperforms shallow classiﬁers by far. Also, while very
comparable results are achieved with the raw (noisy) and
cleaned EEG data for val and asl employing shallow clas-
siﬁers, larger performance differences are noted with the
CNN and MTL methods. This implies that that while all
approaches are able to discriminate the noisy EEG features,
CNN and MTL are able to discriminate better from the
cleaned data. As with audiovisual descriptors, highest F1-
scores with EEG features (close to ceiling performance for

both val and asl) are also obtained with MTL, reinforcing its
utility for emotion recognition.

General Observations: Relatively small σ values are
observed in the ‘All’ condition with both audiovisual and
EEG-based CNN features for the ﬁve-fold CV procedure in
Tables 3 and 4. These trends suggest that the correspond-
ing classiﬁcation models do not overﬁt. Examining tempo-
ral windows considered for audiovisual AR, signiﬁcantly
higher σ’s are nevertheless noted with Han features as well
as with the L30 and L10 temporal segments, conveying that
the corresponding models do not generalize well. Higher σ’s
observed for the L30 and L10 conditions reveal considerable
variance in AR performance on the terminal ad frames.
Contrastingly, very similar σ’s are noted for the different
temporal windows considered with EEG data in Table 4.

Interestingly in Table 3, one can note a considerable
decrease in asl F1 scores for the L30 and L10 conditions with
audio and visual features, while val F1-scores are similar
to the ’All’ condition. Also, a sharp degradation in MTL
performance is noted in the L30 and L10 conditions. Cor-
responding inferences are tabulated as follows. (1) Greater
differences between ads towards endings are characterized
by the large F1 variance in the L30 and L10 conditions with
unimodal and multimodal features; conversely, similar AR
performance is noted with EEG features for the different
temporal segments. This implies that while the audiovisual
information conveying ad emotion may signiﬁcantly vary
over time, human viewers typically tend to grasp the con-
veyed emotion rather instantaneously; (2) Fusion models
synthesized with Han features are most prone to overﬁtting,
given the generally larger σ values seen with respect to
other models. (3) Lower asl F1 scores in the L30 and L10
conditions highlight the limitation of using a single asl/val
label (as opposed to dynamic labeling) over time. Generally
lower F1-scores achieved for asl with all methods in Table 3
suggests that asl is more difﬁcult to characterize than val
(this could possibly explain the lower agreement for asl in
Section 3.1), while coherency between val features and labels
remains sustained over time.

Fusion of Content and User-Centric Modalities:

Given the difference in AR performance observed on min-
ing the content and user-centered descriptors (especially
with respect to variance across temporal segments), one
could possibly conclude that the audiovisual and EEG
modalities encode complementary information. Therefore,
we examined if probabilistic fusion of the content (A+V fc7)
and EEG-based classiﬁer outputs resulted in better asl/val
recognition. Corresponding results are tabulated in Table 5.
Comparing Table 5 against Tables 3 and 4 clearly re-
veals that fusing complementary information is beneﬁcial.
Fusion-based asl and val F1-scores are consistently better
than individual counterparts, and more superior when shal-
low classiﬁers are employed to perform individual predic-
tions (rows 1 and 3). These ﬁndings reveal the potential for
fusion of content and user-centric cues as in [51]–[53].

6 COMPUTATIONAL ADVERTISING - USER STUDY

Presented results clearly reveal that the compiled fc7 au-
diovisual and EEG desciptors outperform the baseline Han
features for ad AR. We now demonstrate that improved AR

positively impacts a computational advertising application–
speciﬁcally, we show that better AR facilitates optimized in-
sertion of ads onto streamed (e.g., YouTube) video. We char-
acterize optimized ad insertion in terms of twin (possibly
conﬂicting) objectives: (1) maximizing ad impact (measured
in terms of ad memorability), and (2) minimially disrupting
(or ideally enhancing) the viewing experience.

The research question that we seek to study here is
Whether better affect estimation, as achieved by the CNN frame-
works harnessing audiovisual and EEG descriptors,
leads to
optimal insertion of ads at appropriate scene transition points in a
video sequence? A principled methodology to insert ads in
video is proposed by the CAVVA algorithm [4]. CAVVA
is a genetic algorithm-based optimization framework for
inserting ads onto streamed video. On top of low-level fea-
ture based contextual matching as proposed by frameworks
such as VideoSense [31], CAVVA models affective relevance
between scenes in a video sequence and ads in an inventory
to determine the (a) suitable ads to insert, and (b) the best
temporal positions in the video sequence where the chosen
ads should be inserted.

Based on consumer psychology insights, CAVVA pro-
poses ad insertion rules that seek to strike a balance between
(a) maximizing ad impact in terms of brand memorability
(i.e., maximizing ad recall), and (b) minimally disrupting
(or even enhancing) viewer engagement and experience. To
examine the above research question, we performed a study
with 18 users to compare ad recall and subjective quality of
advertising schedules generated with affective scores esti-
mated via (a) the content-centric audiovisual CNN model,
(b) the user-centric EEG CNN model and (c) ﬁrst impression
ratings provided by experts. Details of the (i) ad and video
datasets employed, (ii) employed ad insertion strategies and
(iii) user study and associated results are as follows.

6.1 Ad and Video Datasets

For the user study, we used 28 ads (from the original 100),
and three program videos. The ads were equally distributed
among the four quadrants of the asl-val plane based on
expert labels. The program videos were scenes from a tele-
vision sitcom (friends) and two movies (ipoh and coh), which
predominantly comprised social themes and situations ca-
pable of invoking high-to-low valence and moderate arousal
(see Table 6 for statistics). Each program video comprised
eight scenes implying that there were seven possible ad-
insertion points corresponding to scene transitions. The av-
erage scene length in the program videos was 118 seconds.

6.2 Advertisement insertion strategy

We used three affect estimation models (audiovisual CNN,
EEG CNN and manual) to provide asl, val scores for the
ads and video scenes. Asl, val scores for the 24 program

video scenes (8 scenes × 3 videos) were computed as
mean of the ratings (in the range [-2,2] for val and [0,4]
for asl) acquired from three experts, and then rescaled to
[0,1] via min-max normalization. The ad affective scores
were computed as follows. For the content-centric method,
we used normalized softmax class probabilities output by
the video-based CNN model [54] for val estimation, and
corresponding probabilities from the audio CNN for asl
estimation. The mean score computed over all video/audio
frames was used to the denote affective score of an ad in this
method. Similarly, mean of the normalized softmax class
probabilities over all EEG epochs for an ad was used to
denote asl, val score via the user-centric EEG method. The
average of continuous val and asl ratings in [0,1] annotated
via FeelTrace [55] by ﬁve experts was used for Manual scores.
We then adopted the CAVVA framework [4] to gen-
erate nine unique video program sequences (VPSs with
average length of 19.6 minutes) with ads inserted. These
VPSs represent the different combinations of the three pro-
gram videos and the affect estimation approach (audiovi-
sual/EEG/manual). Exactly ﬁve (out of seven possible) ads
were inserted onto each program video. 21 of the 28 chosen
ads were inserted at least once into the nine video programs,
with maximum and mean insertion frequencies of 5 and 2.14
respectively. Among the 21 inserted ads, 13 had been labeled
as high val by experts, while 10 were labeled as high asl.

6.3 Experiment and Questionnaire Design

To evaluate the generated VPSs and thereby the efﬁcacy
of the affect estimation techniques for optimal ad insertions,
we recruited 18 university undergraduates/graduates (7 fe-
male, mean age 20.1 years). Each user viewed three VPSs in
random order such that each of the three VPSs were generated
via a unique affect estimation approach. We used a randomized
3×3 Latin square design in order to cover all the nine VPSs
with every three users. Thus, each VPS was seen by six of the
18 viewers, and we have a total of 54 unique user responses
(18 users × three video modes per user).

We designed the user evaluation so as to reveal whether
the generated VPSs (a) included seamless ad insertions,
(b) facilitated user engagement towards the VPS content
and (c) ensured a pleasant overall viewing experience and
maximized ad memorability (both immediate and long-term).
Recall evaluation is intended to verify if the inserted
ads were attended to and remembered by viewers, and
the immediate and day-after recall were objective measures
quantifying the impact of ad insertion on short-term (imme-
diate) and long-term (day-after) memorability of the VPS-
embedded ads. Speciﬁcally, we measured the proportion of
(i) inserted ads that were correctly recalled (Correct recall or
hit rate), (ii) inserted ads that were not recalled (Forgotten
or miss rate, = 1 − hit rate) and (iii) non-inserted ads in-
correctly recalled as seen (Incorrect recall or false alarm). For
those inserted ads which were correctly recalled, we also
assessed whether viewers perceived them to be contextually
(emotionally) relevant to the program content (i.e., whether
the ad insertions were perceived to be appropriate or good).

Upon viewing a VPS, the viewer was provided with a
representative visual frame from each of the 28 ads and

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING, VOL. ??, NO. ??, JANUARY 1970

a sequence-speciﬁc response sheet to test ad recall and
impression concerning insertion quality. All recall and in-
sertion quality-related responses were acquired as binary
values. In addition to these objective measures, we deﬁned
a second set of subjective user experience measures, and
asked users to provide ratings on a 0–4 Likert scale for the
questions below with 4 implying best and 0 denoting worst.
(1) Were the ads uniformly distributed over the VPS? (2)
Did the inserted ads blend well with the program ﬂow? (3)
Did the inserted ads match with the surrounding scenes in
terms of content and mood? (4) What was the overall viewing
experience while watching each VPS? Each user ﬁlled the
recall and experience-related questionnaires immediately
after watching each VPS. Viewers also ﬁlled in the day-after
recall questionnaire, a day after completing the experiment.

6.4 User study results

As mentioned previously, program video scenes were as-
signed asl, val scores manually by experts, while the
content-centric CNN (denoted as ‘Content’ hereon), EEG
CNN and Manual methods were employed to estimate
affective scores for ads. Overall quality of the CAVVA-
generated VPS is inﬂuenced by the quality of affective rat-
ings assigned to both the video scenes and ads. In this regard,
we hypothesized that better ad affect estimation would
result in optimized ad insertions from the user perspective.
Firstly, we examined if there was any similarity in the
ad asl and val scores estimated by the Content, EEG and
Manual approaches in terms of Pearson correlations. We
found that (1) there was signiﬁcant and positive correlation
between asl scores generated by the Manual and EEG ap-
proaches (ρ = 0.55, p < 0.005), while asl scores computed
via the Manual and Content methods (ρ = 0.13, n.s.) as
well as via Content and EEG (ρ = −0.22, n.s.) were largely
uncorrelated. A similar pattern was noted for val scores
with a highly positive and signiﬁcant correlation observed
between Manual and EEG (ρ = 0.80, p < 0.000001), while
the Content–Manual (ρ = 0.33, p = 0.08) and the Content–
EEG (ρ = 0.19, n.s.) scores showed an insigniﬁcant positive
correlation. These results are indicative of the fact that
neural responses, which represent an implicit manifesta-
tion of emotional perception/expression, best reﬂect explicit
affective impressions reported by humans. It is therefore
unsurprising that a large number of recent affect prediction
approaches [14]–[16], [56] have employed neural sensing as
one of the modalities incorporating emotional information.
Based on viewers’ questionnaire responses, we com-
puted the mean proportions for correct recall, ad forgotten-
ness, incorrect recall and good insertions immediately and
a day after the experiment. Similarly, mean subjective expe-
rience scores were computed for the three VPS generation
schemes. Figure 4 summarizes the response results from
which we make several interesting observations.

A key measure indicative of a successful advertising
strategy is high brand recall [1], [4], [26], and the immediate
and day-after recall rates observed with the three ad affect
estimation methods are presented in Fig. 4 (left),(middle). A
surprising result observed from Fig. 4 (left) and (middle) is
that ads from the content and EEG-based VPSs are better
recalled (or less forgotten) than manual-based. Content-
based ad insertions were best recalled both immediately

and the day-after, even though recall rates for the three ad-
insertion approaches were not statistically different. Given
the extensive literature connecting affective attributes and
memorability, we examined if any such relationships could
be inferred from the user study. Overall, we found a sig-
niﬁcant and positive correlation between ad val rating and
recall (ρ = 0.44, p < 0.05) consistent with prior observations
[9], in addition to the fact that about 2
3 rds of user-viewed ads
were positive in valence.

The recall rate was much worse for the day-after condi-
tion with a high proportion of ads being forgotten. Also, the
proportion of incorrectly recalled ads was minimal in both
the immediate and day-after conditions. Some discernable
differences were observed in the proportion of good insertion
impressions for the three methods– we remark here that
ad recall and viewing experience are not positively corre-
lated (some ads may be memorable because they adversely
disrupted viewing experience); however, embedding ads at
optimal temporal locations can enhance both ad recall and
viewing experience. Post-hoc independent and right-tailed
t-tests revealed that the proportion of immediate ’good
insertion’ impressions was marginally higher for EEG as
compared to manual (t34 = 1.337, p = 0.095).

A number of signiﬁcant differences were nevertheless
observed with respect to subjective user impressions of the
VPSs generated via the three methods (Fig. 4 (right)). The
EEG-based ad insertion mechanism scored highest for all
the considered criteria. Speciﬁcally, uniform insertion scores
were marginally higher for EEG with respect to manual
(t34 = 1.5646, p = 0.063). A one-way balanced ANOVA
on ad relevance scores revealed the signiﬁcant effect of the
ad-insertion strategy (p < 0.05). Post-hoc t-tests further
revealed that EEG-based ad relevance was signiﬁcantly
higher than manual (t34 = 2.3785, p < 0.05) or content-
based (t34 = 2.1893, p < 0.05). EEG-based VPSs were
also found to have the highest viewing experience scores,
and were signiﬁcantly higher with respect to manual-based
VPSs (t34 = 1.7033, p < 0.05). No differences were noted
with respect to user perceptions on ads blendings.

7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

This paper discusses AR from ads, and demonstrates
the utility of estimating ad asl and val (more) accurately
via a computational advertising application. Firstly, based
on expert consensus we compiled a curative set of 100
semantically and emotionally diverse ads, and its ability
to evoke varied-but-coherent emotions across viewers is
examined by studying affective impressions of 14 raters.
Suitability of the dataset for affective studies is conﬁrmed
by (1) the uniform distribution of asl and val ratings over
the rating scale with minimal inter-correlation, and (2) good-
to-excellent agreement between the expert and novice rater
groups as measured in terms of Cohen’s κ scores.

We then evaluated the efﬁcacy of content and user-centric
techniques for ad AR. At the outset, we note that content
and user-centered methods encode complementary emo-
tional information. While content-centric methods examine
audiovisual cues for emotion predict, they typically do not
model context which is crucial for emotion elicitation. The

context may induce in the viewer an emotion very different
from expectation based on the content, and therefore we hy-
pothesized that examining user cues could be more effective
as evidenced by many of the recent AR approaches.

Our extensive content-centered AR experiments con-
ﬁrmed that: (1) The proposed fc7 audio and visual CNN de-
scriptors better predicted val, and overall F1-scores revealed
that video features were better at encoding emotions than
spectrogram-based fc7 descriptors; (2) Multimodal methods
achieved better AR than unimodal ones, and the (A+V)
fc7 features produced substantially better results than au-
diovisual Han features for val; Probabilistic decision fusion
achieved superior results with respect to feature fusion for
asl, but inferior results for val.

On the other hand, AR experiments with user-centric
EEG features revealed that (1) EEG features produced supe-
rior AR performance than audiovisual descriptors; (2) The
three-layer CNN classiﬁer outperformed shallow classiﬁers
trained on EEG data, and (3) Very comparable F1-scores
were achieved with the CNN classiﬁer with both raw (or
noisy) and clean EEG data, even though shallow classiﬁers
performed better with the cleaned features.

The above results conﬁrm the hypothesis that emotions
are better characterized by user-centric cues, which are
inherently better modulated by context [9] than content-
centric ones. Furthermore, content-centric classiﬁcation re-
sults observed over different temporal windows reveal that
content features coherently reﬂect human impressions of
val over time, but not of asl. There are two possible ex-
planations to this end: (a) Multiple studies have found
that user impressions of stimulus val are more stable and
consistent as compared to asl; also the audiovisual content
of ads designed to convey an element of surprise/shock is
likely to exhibit signiﬁcant changes over time. (b) Owing to
these variations, the use of a single affective label over the
entire ad duration may be inappropriate, especially for asl,
and seeking to predict time-varying affective labels could
be more appropriate. Interestingly though, EEG-based AR
results (Table 4) show only a minor deviation between the
F30 and L30 conditions even for asl (lower F1-scores for the
L10 condition can also be attributed to fewer training data)
suggests that humans are able to grasp the general mood of
advertisements fairly quickly.

An overview of the cumulative AR results reveals mini-
mal model overﬁtting– the variation in F1 scores across the
50 runs is fairly small in the ’All’ condition for content-
centric AR and over all conditions for user-centered AR.
Among classiﬁers, RBF SVM consistently produced the best
results among single-task classiﬁers, implying the audiovi-
sual as well as EEG features may not be trivially linearly

seperable in their respective feature spaces. However, lin-
ear multi-task learning classiﬁer achieved close-to-ceiling
performance implying that learning commonalities among
similarly labeled ads facilitates better feature separability.
Finally, fusing the content and user-centric results as in
Table 5 produced better F1-scores as compared to either
modality, revealing the promise of mining both the content
and user for accurate emotion prediction.

We then proceeded to check if improved emotion esti-
mation enabled optimized ad insertion for computational
advertising. Based on data compiled from 18 users, we ob-
served that video program sequences generated via audio-
visual and EEG-based affective scores were more effective
in terms of ad recall and eliciting a better user experience
than manually generated VPSs. Ads from content-based
VPSs were recalled marginally better, both immediately
and the day after. EEG-based VPSs received the highest
scores for the viewing experience-related attributes. Ads in
EEG-based VPSs were perceived to be (a) more uniformly
distributed, and (b) more emotionally matched (or relevant)
to the surrounding video scenes. Finally, EEG-based VPSs
were also found to produce the best viewing experience.

The surprising ﬁnding of audiovisual and EEG-based
VPSs being superior to the manual VPS can be explained as
follows. Audiovisual and EEG-based asl and val scores were
estimated via CNN models, and deep CNNs have recently
performed comparable to or better than humans in tasks
such as object recognition [58] and facial expression recog-
nition [59] due to their ability to extract ﬁne details from
data. The CAVVA optimization framework [4] comprises
two components– one for selecting ad insertion points into the
program video, and another for selecting the ads. Asl scores
only play a role in the choice of insertion points, whereas
val scores inﬂuence both components. As the EEG-based
framework performs best for both asl and val recognition,
it also results in the most optimal ad insertions, and conse-
quently in the best viewing experience. Finally, humans are
better at rating attributes in relative than absolute terms [60],
[61], which explains why the manually acquired ad-level asl
and val scores may not be accurate (even if their general
trends are consistent with the EEG scores as seen from the
correlations computed in Sec. 6.4).

The importance of context for conveying emotions via
audiovisual media such as movies and ads makes context
modeling critical for AR. Recurrent neural networks have
shown promise at encoding content and user-centric data
for emotion [62] and mental state [63] recognition. Likewise,
paucity of large-scale labeled datasets in the ad AR do-
main motivates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate

synthetic data. Future work will involve exploring these
frameworks for recognizing and estimating ad emotions.
Another line of research would be to develop algorithms
that perform real-time emotional assessment of streamed
video, and perform ad insertion on the ﬂy. We will also
focus on developing effective and principled methods for
computational advertising, as CAVVA is modeled on ad-hoc
rules derived from consumer psychology literature.
