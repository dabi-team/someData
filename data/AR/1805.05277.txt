ABSTRACT
We report on the 22-23 June 2015 geomagnetic storm which occurred during the summer solstice
time. There has been a shortage of intense geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle 24 in
relation to the previous cycle. This situation changed after mid-June 2015 when one of the biggest
solar active regions (AR 2371) of current solar cycle 24, close to the central meridian produced several
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with M-class ﬂares. The CMEs impact on the Earth’s
magnetosphere resulted in a moderately-severe G4-class geomagnetic storm on 22-23 June 2015 and
a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storms on 24 June. The G4 solstice storm was the second biggest
(so far) geomagnetic storms of cycle 24. We highlight the ground level observations made by New-
Tupi, Muonca and the CARPET El Leoncito cosmic ray detectors that are located within the South
Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. These observations are studied in correlation with data obtained
by space-borne detectors (ACE, GOES, SDO, and SOHO) and other ground-based experiments. The
CME designations are from the Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) automated catalog. As
expected, Forbush Decreases (FD) associated with the passing CMEs were recorded by these detectors.
We noticed a peculiar feature linked to a severe geomagnetic storm event. The 21 June 2015 CME
0091 was likely associated with the 22 June summer solstice FD event. The angular width of CME
0091 was very narrow and measured ∼ 56◦ degrees seen from Earth. In most cases, only CME halos
and partial halos, lead to severe geomagnetic storms. We performed a cross-check analysis of the FD
events detected during the rise phase of the current solar cycle 24, the geomagnetic parameters, and
the CACTus CME catalog. Our study suggests that narrow angular-width CMEs that erupt in the
western region of the ecliptic plane can lead to moderate and severe geomagnetic storms. We also
report on the strong solar proton radiation storm with onset on 21 June. We did not ﬁnd a signal
from this SEP at ground level. The details of these observations are presented.

INTRODUCTION

Augusto et al.

Since its inception in 2008, the current solar cycle 24 has been weak compared with prior periods in recent cycles.
Historically, sunspots (intense magnetic activity areas that appear as dark spots compared to surrounding regions) are
indicators of the nearly periodic 11-year solar magnetic activity cycle2. The current cycle 24 has two peak maximum
of sunspots as shown in Fig. 1. In the current cycle 24 the second peak3 (in 2014) in sunspot number was larger than
the ﬁrst (in 2011).

The cycle 24 has the smallest maximum monthly sunspot number since cycle 14, which took place between February
1902 and August 1913. It could be an indication of the beginning of some change in solar variability (Pesnell 2016).
While the most likely outcome of the present changes in the open magnetic ﬂux of the Sun is a fall to average
conditions, statistical analysis showed that there is an 8% chance of a return to Maunder Minimum4within the next
40 years (Lockwood 2010; Ineson et al. 2015). Earth’s interplanetary environment is constantly inﬂuenced by the
transient disturbances propagating from the Sun. Interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are
often associated with solar ﬂares and active regions on the Sun’s surface (Burlaga 1995; Gonzalez, Gonzalez and
Tsurutani 1990; Tsurutani et al. 1992; Gonzalez, Tsurutani and Clua de Gonzalez 1999).

If the interplanetary counterparts of the CMEs have a signiﬁcant southward component (Bz), of the interplanetary
magnetic ﬁeld (IMF), in either the sheath behind the shock or in the driver gas (magnetic cloud), then after reaching
Earth’s magnetosphere, they may lead to geomagnetic storms (Tsurutani et al. 1988, 1992).

The frequency of geomagnetic storms varies with the solar cycle (Gonzalez, Gonzalez and Tsurutani 1990). The
mild space weather during cycle 24 can be illustrated by the number of major geomagnetic storms in comparison with
its predecessor, cycle 23. In Fig. 2 we show the Kp index5 distribution of the top 50 strongest geomagnetic storms in
cycle 236 (Zhang et al. 2007) and cycle 247 (as of 2016 September) (Pande, Mathpal and Pande 2018). It is clear that
the number of major storms has declined in cycle 24 relative to cycle 23. There were observed 22 events with Kp = 8
(G4, severe)8 in cycle 23, and 7 events of this category in cycle 24. There is a decline in the number of the strongest
geomagnetic storms, those cataloged as Kp = 9 (G5, extreme): 13 events in cycle 23 and none (so far) in cycle 24.
The majority of the strongest geomagnetic storms in cycle 24 are of Kp = 6 (G2, moderate). Many peculiarities and
anomalies of cycle 24 and their eﬀects on Earth have been the subject of multiple studies (e.g. Gopalswamy et al. 2014,
2015).

Solar disturbances aﬀect the propagation of galactic cosmic rays. When the solar disturbances pass the Earth’s
magnetosphere, the ground-based detectors can observe depressions of cosmic ray intensity, the so-called Forbush
Decreases (FD) (Forbush 1937). Typically, the bow shock at the front of the magnetic cloud (ICME) can act as a
barrier that prevents cosmic rays from reaching the Earth. The decrease in the observed intensity is followed by a
gradual recovery that typically lasts up to several days (Lockwood 1971). Most of the cosmic-ray decreases observed by
ground-based neutron monitors are attributed to CME-driven geomagnetic storms (Cane, Richardson and Rosenvinge
1996; Cane 2000; Cane and Richardson 2003). The magnitude of an FD observed by a particular detector depends
on several factors, such as the size of the CME, the strength of the magnetic ﬁelds in the CME, the proximity of the
CME to the Earth, and the location of the detector on the Earth (Cliver and Cane 1996; Kim et al. 2008).

In this work, we present the ﬁrst results of the analysis of data acquired by cosmic ray detectors located in the South
Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region during one of the strongest (so far) geomagnetic storms of cycle 24, the 22-23 June
2015 geomagnetic storm. Diﬀerent aspects of the storm, that occurred during the 2015 summer solstice9 time, were
previously reported by other groups (Liu et al. 2015; Astafyeva et al. 2016; Mohanty et al. 2016; Baker et al. 2016).

We present and analyze the FD associated with this geomagnetic storm using data from New Tupi and Muonca
muon telescopes located in Brazil and the CARPET (El Leoncito) detector located in Argentina. This event is also
studied in correlation with observations reported by spacecraft detectors (ACE, GOES, SDO, and SOHO) and other
ground-based experiments.

The organization of the paper is as follows.

In section 2, we give a brief description of the experiments and
methodology. Section 3 describes the temporal sequence of events during an active storm period of June 2015 and
the Solstice Storm event. Section 4 presents a cross-check between the CACTus CME catalog, the geomagnetic
parameters and the FD events detected during the ascension phase of the current solar cycle 24 (2010-2013). The aim
is to characterize the CMEs triggering geomagnetic storms, associated with FD observed in ground level detectors.
We include in Section 5 the information on solar energetic particles observed in spacecraft detectors in the period. In
Section 6, we present our conclusions.

The paper includes an appendix that presents a table with the basic information on the selected FDs (for the time
interval 2010-2013 and the solstice event), the CME parameters from the CACTus CME catalog and the ring current
Dst indices. The FD parameters are based on the Oulu NM data, the FD data listed in Lingri et al. (2016) and
New-Tupi telescope data.

Augusto et al.

Cosmic rays are highly energetic particles (mostly protons) reaching Earth from all directions in space. In general,
there are two categories of cosmic rays: primary and secondary. Primary cosmic rays originate far outside Earth’s
atmosphere. They are mainly of galactic origin, though include contributions from transient particle ﬂux of solar
origin and an anomalous component originating at the edge of the heliosphere (Fichtner 2001). Secondary cosmic rays
are particles produced within Earth’s atmosphere due to collisions between primary cosmic rays in the atmosphere,
producing a cascade of secondary collisions and particles known as a shower, air shower, or cascade shower. Secondary
cosmic rays shower down to Earth’s surface and even penetrate it. The decay of pions and kaons produced in these
collisions results in a great variety of species, for instance, a neutral pion decays to two photons (gamma rays)
that, by pair production phenomena, are transformed in an electron-positron pair which can produce photons by
Bremsstrahlung. It is known as the electromagnetic component (γ and e±) of the air shower. Ground level detectors
at mountain altitudes can detect this component. Following the charged pion decay, the shower has a muon component.
The muon is an unstable subatomic particle with a mean lifetime of 2.2 microseconds. Muons lose their energy by
ionization of the material through which they pass. The time dilation eﬀect of special relativity (from the viewpoint
of the Earth) allows secondary muons of high energy to reach the detector at sea level and even penetrate deep
underground. Muons produced at about 10-20 km heights above Earth surface are the most numerous energetic
particles (∼ 95% at E > 1 GeV) arriving at sea level. Muon telescopes use coincidence detection method.

2.2. Cosmic ray detectors in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region
In this paper, we place an emphasis on three cosmic-ray experiments dedicated to studying space weather eﬀects
and diverse solar transient events at ground level. All of them are located in the SAA, which embraces a great part of
South America’s central region. The SAA is the region where the Earth’s inner Van Allen radiation belt is closest to
the planet’s surface. The result is a deep depression in the magnetosphere. It reduces the shielding eﬀect to charged
particles that come from space (Casolino et al. 2009). Fig. 3 shows geomagnetic curves of total magnetic ﬁeld intensity
according to the US/UK World Magnetic Model Epoch 2000 (Macmillan and Quinn 2000) together with the location
of the three cosmic rays detectors used in this work. The SAA region is clearly indicated by the lowest magnetic ﬁeld
over the Earth (with a ﬁeld strength of ∼ 22000 nT). However, the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld components in the SAA
is only slightly higher than those observed at polar regions (see Table 1).

This behavior introduces a sub-cutoﬀ in the geomagnetic rigidity, below the nominal Stormer cut-oﬀ, as reported
by the Pamela satellite (Casolino et al. 2009). We have shown that this eﬀect of the SAA, seen at satellite altitudes,
extends at least in part to the particles detected by ground-level instruments. Indeed, under special conditions, an
excess of muons at ground level was observed in association with a high-speed stream impact (Augusto et al. 2017).

In Fig. 3 the point with number 1 marks the location of New-Tupi experiment at Niteroi city, Brazil (Augusto et al.
2017). Number 2 shows the location of the Muonca (MUONs in Campinas) experiment designed to study the muon
ﬂux variations associated with solar events. The detector is situated in Campinas, Brazil (Fauth et al. 2015). This
experiment has been taking data continuously since 2014 April 1. The third point marks the CARPET cosmic ray
detector at Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (CASLEO)10 in Argentina that has been monitoring secondary cosmic
ray intensity since 2006 (De Mendon¸ca et al. 2013). Table 1 summarizes the situation and includes information on the
Oulu neutron monitor used in this work.

2.3. New-Tupi and Muonca
The muon stations located in Brazil, Muonca and New-Tupi are based respectively at the University of Campinas,
S˜ao Paulo and the Fluminense Federal University, Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro. The distance between these two cities
is 480 km. Each muon station has two muon telescopes, and each telescope consists of two detectors. The aim of
the muon detectors is the study of the muon ﬂux variations observed at the ground level associated with diverse
transient phenomena. Each detector is assembled on the basis of plastic scintillator slab (150 × 75 × 5 cm3). Details
of experimental setup are reported on Fauth et al. (2015); Augusto et al. (2017).

The four detector units are placed in pairs, with T1 (top) and B1 (bottom) and T2 and B2 respectively. This layout
allows us to obtain the muon ﬂux from three directions, the vertical, west, and east, the last two with an inclination

around 45 degrees. The telescopes record the coincidence rate between T1 and B1; T2 and B2 (vertical), T1 and
B2 (west), and T2 and B1 (east). Both vertical and lateral separation between the detectors is 2.83 m. The Fig. 4
summarizes the situation.

2.3.2. The scaler mode

In parallel with the telescope mode, Muonca is operated in the scaler mode (or single particle technique mode)
(O’Brian and Porter 1976; Morello, Navarra and Periale 1984; Aglietta et al. 1996), where the single hit rates of all
of the four PMTs are recorded once a second. This mode allows us to detect muon ﬂux at ﬁxed time intervals, within
a wide ﬁeld of view. However, the eﬃciency of particle detection in the scaler mode decreases as the zenith angle of
the incident particle increases, due to atmospheric absorption. Thus, the scaler method is limited to incident particles
with the zenith angle less than 60 degrees.

2.4. The El Leoncito detector
The CARPET charged particles detector was developed within an international cooperation between the Lebedev
Physical Institute RAS (LPI, Russia), the Centro de Radio Astronomia e Astroﬁsica Mackenzie (CRAAM, Brazil) and
the Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (CASLEO, San Juan, Argentina). The place of operation of the El Leoncito
detector is in the Argentinian Andes. The instrument is based on 240 Geiger type tubes. Details of experimental setup
are reported on De Mendon¸ca et al. (2013); Makhmutov et al. (2013, 2015).

2.5. Detector comparisons
The cosmic ray instruments located at mountain altitudes detect a wide variety of secondary particles, especially
neutrons, protons, and electrons. The muon detectors, speciﬁcally those located close to the sea level, mostly detect

pressure (in mbar) (Fauth et al. 2015). Bottom panel: the relative cosmic ray intensity variation observed by the channel N12 of El Leoncito
detector on July 2009 versus the pressure deviation (in hPa) (De Mendon¸ca et al. 2013). The least squared ﬁt estimates give the barometric
coeﬃcient βp = (−0.22 ± 0.04) %/mbar at Muonca (Fauth et al. 2015) and βp = (−0.44 ± 0.01) %/mbar at El Leoncito (De Mendon¸ca et
al. 2013). 1 mbar is equal to 1 hPa.

the muon component (often called the hard component, due to their large penetration) of the cosmic rays. However,
there are some similarities. For instance, these muon detectors and the cosmic ray neutron monitors have the same
energy threshold, close to 100 MeV. Also, for detectors installed at the same location, the corrected counting rate
of neutron monitors was conﬁrmed to match the counting rate of the muon detector with a correlation coeﬃcient of
0.8046 (Kim et al. 2012).

2.6. Pressure corrections
The cosmic ray intensity as recorded by ground-based detectors varies with atmospheric pressure (Dorman and
Dorman 1995; Hebbeker and Timmermans 2002). The anti-correlated relation between both is well known. In order
to remove the atmospheric pressure change inﬂuence on cosmic ray intensity observed by a detector, it is necessary
to obtain the barometric coeﬃcient, which is inferred experimentally, and in most cases, the value is about βp ∼
−1.0%/mbar.

The inﬂuence of the pressure atmospheric variation on the muon counting rate is weaker. Fig. 5 (top panel) shows
the muon rate measured by the Muonca telescope versus barometric pressure (in mbar) (Fauth et al. 2015) together
with the relative cosmic ray intensity variation observed by the channel N12 of the El Leoncito detector on July 2009
versus the pressure deviation (in hPa) (De Mendon¸ca et al. 2013). The evaluation of the barometric coeﬃcients using
the least squared ﬁt estimates gives the barometric coeﬃcient βp = (−0.22 ± 0.04) %/mbar at Muonca (Fauth et al.
2015) and βp = (−0.44 ± 0.01) %/mbar at El Leoncito (De Mendon¸ca et al. 2013).

These experimental results are also in agreement with the muon barometric coeﬃcients obtained via Monte Carlo
calculations, by means of the CORSIKA code (Kovylyaeva et al. 2013). Thus, the barometric coeﬃcient for muons (at
sea level or near it) is about ten times (or at least seven times) lower than the barometric coeﬃcient for the neutron
monitors in the energy region above 0.1 GeV.

2.7. Data sets
In this paper, we examined the most widely used indicators of global magnetospheric activity (Mayaud 1980), the
estimated 3 hr planetary Kp index11 and the ring current Dst index12. The Kp and Dst indices show diﬀerent
behaviors during diﬀerent types of solar wind drivers; they also have diﬀerent sensitivities to the diﬀerent storm time
current systems (Gonzalez et al. 1994; Huttunen, Koskinen and Schwenn 2002). We also used the data measurements
of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic ﬁeld measured by the EMBRACE Magnetometer Network available
from http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/resumo-de-indices.

The EMBRACE magnetometers are scattered in South America and covering the SAA region13 (Denardini et al.
2015), and the measurements of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic ﬁeld are done by the diﬀerence between
the mean of the ﬁve most quiet days of the previous month (according to International Q-Days and D-Days, Kyoto)
and the H component of each station. The values of the Auroral Electrojet Index (AE) are also utilized in our study.
The AE index is the measure of auroral zone magnetic activity produced by enhanced ionospheric currents in the
auroral zone in the northern hemisphere (Davis and Sugiura 1966). We compared our observations with the particle,
solar wind and magnetic ﬁeld available data obtained by spacecraft detectors.

The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) (Stone et al. 1998) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
(Harrison et al. 1995). They are in orbit around the Sun, at the Sun-Earth Lagrange (L1) point (approximately
1.5 × 106km from Earth) and provide near real-time solar wind information and continuous real-time monitoring of
space weather. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) circle the Earth in a geosynchronous
orbit and provide solar X-ray data, the local magnitude and direction of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, as well as solar
proton ﬂux (Rodriguez, Onsager and Mazur 2010). The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Pesnell, Thompson and
Chamberlin 2011) satellite observes the Sun in an inclined geosynchronous orbit and provides heliospheric imagery
with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The number of halo
and partial-halo CMEs from the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on-board the SOHO are taken
from the CDAW catalog14.

The Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) identiﬁcation of CMEs is taken from http://sidc.oma.be/cactus/
catalog/LASCO/ and analyzed in temporal coincidence with the solar ﬂares15,16.
Identiﬁcation of interplanetary
structures and associated solar activity was based on the nomenclature and deﬁnitions given by the satellite ob-
servations, including an incomplete list of possible interplanetary shocks observed by the CELIAS/MTOF Proton
Monitor the SOHO spacecraft17. For estimation of the geomagnetic storm onset, we also used the OMNIWeb data
services18. For our analysis, we also used data obtained from the High-Resolution Neutron Monitor Database (NMDB)
(http://www.nmdb.eu).

3. THE 2015 SUMMER SOLSTICE EVENT
In the middle of June 2015, the Sun’s activity increased in one of the biggest sunspot active regions (AR) (NOAA
AR 2371) directly facing Earth. From 18-23 June, the AR 2371 erupted four times. Over the next 5 days there were
four M-class ﬂares. On 18 June 2015 active region 2371 displayed a beta-gamma magnetic conﬁguration (Hale and
Nicholson 1925), and was located at N09E50 (solar disc coordinates). It produced a long duration M3.0-class solar
ﬂare. The ﬂare started at 16:30 UT, peaked at 17:36 UT and ended at 18:25 UT. A full halo CME was produced in this
event. In the CACTus catalog (Robbrecht, Berghmans and Van der Linden 2009; Robbrecht and Berghmans 2004)
this is CME 0078. It was observed by SOHO at 17:24 UTC on 18 June. A partial halo CME seen by SOHO/LASCO
C2 was associated with a large solar ﬁlament eruption in the SSE quadrant (S27E06) of the solar disc observed in
SDO/AIA imagery on 19 June. AR 2371 with the changed magnetic conﬁguration (beta-gamma-delta) and produced
a pair of M2-class ﬂares (located at N12E13 and N12E16) on 21 June. Also associated with this ﬂare, CME 0090
became visible in LASCO C2 imagery at 02:36 UT. Also within the time period of the dual ﬂare, CME 0091 occurred
at 02:48 with strong shock waves propagated in the western region of the ecliptic plane at ∼ 270 degrees. On 22 June
the same active region with a beta-gamma conﬁguration (located at N13W06) produced an M6.5 solar ﬂare at 18:23
UT. A full halo CME, 0093, was produced and became visible in LASCO C2 imagery at 18:36 UT.

The images of CME 0078, 0079, 0090, 0091, 0093 are presented in Fig. 6. The ﬂare site is shown in Fig. 7 indicating

the active region AR 2371.

3.1. The ﬁrst CME impact on Earth’s magnotosphere
According to the SOHO CELIAS/MTOF Proton Monitor on the SOHO spacecraft, in the period 21-22 June, three
interplanetary shocks passed the L1 point. The ﬁrst one was detected on 21 June at 15:50 UTC. The weak impact
with the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld was seen at ∼ 16:45 UT by Boulder USGS Magnetometer19. The source of this
interplanetary disturbance is estimated to be the eruption of the CME 0078 on 18 June. The travel time of the CME
0078 to reach Earth was ∼ 71 h withing the expected for a CME with an average speed of 525 km s−1. However, his
impact did not cause an immediate geomagnetic storm.

vertical arrows show the onset time at Earth of the interplanetary shocks originated by the CMEs.

3.2. Second and third impacts on Earth
On 22 June at 04:52 UT, a second interplanetary shock crossed L1 and the shock arrived at Earth at 05:45 UT.
There were subsequent enhancements in solar wind velocity and density, i.e., a third interplanetary shock crossed L1 at
18:01 UT. These impacts were classiﬁed as shock waves by SOHO CELIAS/MTOF20. The third impact at Earth was
registered at ∼ 18:37 UT, and only after this third impact, the ground-level detectors observed depressions of galactic
cosmic ray intensity, the FD. The superposition eﬀects of the succession of passing ICMEs and the impacts in the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and surrounding regions (such as the L1 triggered the 22-23 June (G4 severe-class) geomagnetic
storm (Kp = 8). This strong perturbation of the geomagnetic ﬁeld was the so-called 2015 Summer Solstice storm.
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 summarize the situation.

In section 4 we will discuss a cross-check between the CACTus CME catalog parameters, the associated geomagnetic

parameters and a possible association between the second and third impacts.

panel), the counting rate in the El Leoncito detector and the Oulu NM data (bottom panel). The black arrows at the
top of the ﬁgure show the onset time at Earth of the three interplanetary shocks originated by the CMEs. As can be
seen from Fig. 8, the Bz magnetic component made oscillations in coincidence with the second impact. A prolonged
period of mostly southward Bz occurred after the third impact and remained negative from ∼ 01:50 UT until ∼ 06:00
UT on 23 June, reaching as low as ∼ −25 nT. The FD intensity (depression) reached an amplitude of up to 4% in
New-Tupi vertical telescope and Muonca. In addition, note a good agreement between New-Tupi vertical telescope
and Muonca scaler data.

Fig. 9 shows a good temporal correlation between the Kp index (top panel), 1 hour binning muon counting rate in
Muonca (scaler data) and the cosmic ray counting rate corrected for pressure and temperature eﬀects in the detector
at El Leoncito (second panel), the Dst index (third panel) and the EMBRACE magnetometer data in the period 22-23
June 2015. The planetary geomagnetic index Kp shows a period of enhanced geomagnetic activity reaching the level
from G3 (Kp = 7) to G4 (Kp = 8) at ∼ 18:50 UT on 22 June, with the arrival of the third shock, as shown in Fig. 8
(top panel).

The El Leoncito cosmic ray detector measured the FD amplitude of about 3.7%. One can see that the maximum
intensity of the FD and the Dst index of about −200 nT are almost in temporal coincidence due to the third impact
on 22 June, both reaching the minimum value at the early hours on 23 June. The third impact has a good temporal
correlation with data from the EMBRACE magnetometers that measured −198 nT for the horizontal component of
the geomagnetic ﬁeld at ∼ 20:30 UT on 22 June.

June 2015) observed in the counting rate can be easily identiﬁed. The black arrows on the top of the ﬁgure correspond to CME 0093.

The AE index showed strong variations 2 h after the second impact with a peak above 1,000 nT at 07:30 UT21,22.
The third impact showed a temporal correlation with variations in the AE index exceeding 2,000 nT in the time period
between 18:30 and 20:30 UT. The AE index followed an oscillatory behavior, often reaching values above 1,000 nT
until ∼ 13:00 UT on 23 June. It was a severe geomagnetic storm, one of the strongest in the current solar cycle 24.

3.3. The fourth impact on Earth
The fourth impact was observed at 13:30 UT on 24 June with the arrival of a shock wave from CME 0093 on 22
June.
It is indicated by the last vertical arrow in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. A small fall in the muon counting rate was
observed by New-Tupi, Muonca, CARPET, and Oulu. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 summarize the situation. This is an example
of a mini-FD event (Navia et al. 2005). Usually, they indicate an interplanetary disturbance that crosses the vicinity of
Earth. However, in the present case, the situation is diﬀerent, since the origin of the FD was a full halo CME directed
towards Earth (see section 4).

Augusto et al.

As can be seen in Fig. 9 (top panel), the eﬀect of this fourth CME impact on the planetary Kp index became evident
in early hours on 25 June, producing a moderate geomagnetic storm of level G2 (Kp = 6). There is also a small signal
in the Dst index and the EMBRACE magnetometers data shown in Fig. 9 (third and fourth panels).

We note that the time of impact of the interplanetary disturbance attributed to CME 0093 (last CME) is in temporal
coincidence with the onset of the mini-FDs (see Fig. 8 and Fig. 9), whereas there is a delay (∼ 16 h) between the
impact of the CME and the onset of the geomagnetic storm reﬂected by the Kp and Dst indices. In addition, there
are no signs of signiﬁcant disturbances in the AE measurements in temporal coincidence with the fourth impact on
24 June 23. The AE index again showed values above 1,000 nT at 7:30 UT on 25 June24, showing similar dynamic
behavior with the Kp and Dst indices.

We would like to point out, that the fourth impact occurred under very special conditions, i.e., it was already

perturbed geomagnetic condition due to two previous impacts.

In order to investigate the eﬀect at the ground level of the fourth impact (CME 0093) on 24 June, we analyzed data
from New-Tupi and Muonca (scaler data) using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (Torrence and Compo 1998;
Rybak, Antalova and Storini 2001). The Fourier spectrum of a signal represents the frequency content of the signal,
the signal itself is in the time domain. The frequency spectrum in time-frequency maps is given for each time step so
that one can see the evolution of the frequencies. The CWT spectra were obtained for the combined data between
New-Tupi and Muonca (scaler data) and are presented in Fig. 10 (bottom panel). In this case, both signals show high
power variance. High power (variance) is indicated by red color whereas low power is indicated by blue color. One
can see that the mini-FDs (top panel Fig. 10) is correlated with the narrow peak of the CWT, both are identiﬁed.

The forth impact (originated by CME 0093) has stretched the total duration (from the onset time until the recovery
time) of the main summer solstice FD for at least 48 h, as shown in Fig. 10 (top panel). The estimated mini-FDs
recovery time interval is deﬁned as the time required for the counting rate to return from the maximum depression to
the pre-FDs level. According to Usoskin et al. (2008), the shape of the recovery phase of an FD can be approximated by
an exponential recovery function I = I0 × A exp(−t/τ ), where I and I0 are the current and undisturbed CR intensities,
A is an amplitude and τ is the characteristic recovery time.
In the present case, the situation is more complex,
because the mini-FDs occurred in a previously perturbed geomagnetic ﬁeld. However, it still can be described by an
exponential function. The mini-FDs recovery time is estimated as, τ = (51 ± 5)h. The bold line on Fig. 10 (top panel)
summarizes the situation. Finally, the recovery time of the Summer Solstice FD is estimated as 144 h.

4. CROSS-CHECK BETWEEN THE CACTUS CME CATALOG, FD EVENTS AND THE GEOMAGNETIC PARAMETERS
In this section we discuss the CACTus CME parameters and compare them with the geomagnetic parameters, as

well as experimental data on FDs.

4.1. The CACTus catalog
The images of the CMEs derived from the coronagraph observation (SOHO-LASCO C2) have only an apparent
geometric meaning, since they depend on the orientation of the CME in the relation of the observer (L1). The outputs
given by CACTus include information on the CME identiﬁcation number, onset time (earliest indication of liftoﬀ),
position angle (pa) (counterclockwise from solar north; degrees), angular width (da) in degrees, median velocity (km
s−1), and the highest velocity detected within the CME (Robbrecht, Berghmans and Van der Linden 2009; Robbrecht
and Berghmans 2004).

The angular width derived from projected images is only an apparent quantity, which indicates the angular size of
the CME volume projected onto the plane of the sky. The da distribution is essentially scale-invariant, which means
that there is no typical size of a CME. Most CMEs have an angular width around 30◦, and the number of CMEs
decreases as the angular width increases, following a power law distribution. If da > 90◦, then a CME is classiﬁed
as type II, while a CME with da > 180◦ is called type III or partial halo. Halo CMEs are those with da > 270◦ (or
type IV). A CME appears as a halo or partial halo if it is launched in a path close to the Sun-Earth direction. This
explains, at least in part, why most geomagnetic storms triggering FD are associated with full halo CMEs (e.g., Belov
et al. (2014)).

The position angle pa is correlated with the CME projected latitude, and it is deﬁned as the middle angle of the
CME when seen in white-light images and depends on the orientation of the CME in the relation of the observer (L1).
Thus, the projected latitudes are only an approximation of the true direction of propagation. Values of the pa close to
90 and 270 degrees represent zero latitudes. When pa = 90◦ and pa = 270◦, this means that the middle angle of the
CME coincides with the eastern side and with the western side of the ecliptic plane, respectively. We will show that
CMEs with a narrow width angle can trigger geomagnetic storms only if their pa is close to 270 degrees, i.e., close
to the western region of the ecliptic plane. The CACTus catalog shows that the latitude dependence of the CMEs is
approximately a ﬂat (random) distribution, with some structure; it is strongly restricted to two broad bands around
∼ 50◦ latitude, and also depends strongly on the solar cycle time.

The speed proﬁle measured by CACTus shows that CMEs have internal speed variability of the plasma structure.
This behavior is probably due to interaction with diﬀerent background solar wind structures. CACTus measures a
linear speed proﬁle as a function of the pa (latitude) and lists the median and maximum speed values, while the previous
catalog, such as the CDAW25 (Yashiro et al. 2004; Gopalswamy 2009) reported only the fastest moving feature of the

leading edge. The CACTus CME speed is log-normally distributed, peaking at 200-400 km s−1. The uncertainty in the
speed is larger during the solar maximum and is higher than 175 km s−1. Fig. 11 summarizes the CACTus parameters
of the ﬁve CMEs detected in the period 18-23 June 2015. The external contour represents the angular width, while
the short and long red lines within each area show the median and the maximum speed, respectively. The median
CME speed is oriented according to the pa.

The width above 270◦ indicates that CME 0078 and CME 0093 are halo CMEs. We can see from Fig. 11 that CME
0079 of 19 June (the solar ﬁlament eruption) was directed to the southeast region, below the ecliptic plane. There is
no signal of the passage of the CME ejecta associated with this blast by L1 and, consequently, there was no signiﬁcant
impact on the magnetosphere is expected from this eruption. Thus, it is likely that CME 0079 was not associated
with the second impact on Earth on 22 June (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9).

4.2. Cross-check between the CACTus catalog and ground level observations
The next step is to cross-check the CACTus catalog and the ground-level observations. We are looking for the
particular features of the CMEs that triggered geomagnetic storms and were associated with the observed FD events.
Previous studies (Gopalswamy 2009) show that a typical geoeﬀective CME is characterized by (a) high speed, (b) a
large angular width (mostly halos and partial halos), and (c) a solar source location close to the central meridian.
In general, a full halo CME means a CME directed to the Earth and a narrow CME with pa 270◦ means a CME
propagating in the ecliptic plane and only its projection in the coronograph points to the west. Thus if a full CME
and a narrow width CME with pa 270◦ originate around the same time within the same active region and with
approximately the same speed, then they have almost the same travel time. This is approximately to the case of
CME 0090 (partial halo) and the CME 0091 (narrow width). These CMEs erupted with high velocities and almost
simultaneously from the same active region AR 2371, when it was close to the central meridian (see Fig. 7). CME
0090 erupted almost in the Sun-Earth direction (partial halo event), with the pa to the solar southeast. Despite the
narrow width angle, the pa of CME 0091 was close to 270◦, the bulk of the CME material was clearly propagating in
the westward direction. Thus, the second and third impacts of 22 June were likely associated with the CME 0090 and
the CME 0091, respectively. From Fig. 11 we can see that the narrow CME 0091 and the full halo CME 0093 had
similar pas close to 270◦.

In addition, it was shown above that only after the impact of CME 0091 on 22 June (third impact) the G4 geomagnetic

storm was triggered, and only after the impact of CME 0093 on 23 June (fourth impact) the G2 geomagnetic storm
was triggered. In this interpretation, the portion of CME 0090 which encountered Earth was very weak. Most of
the plasma was ejected to the southeast direction as can be seen in Fig. 11. Hence, the second impact of 22 June is
consistent with the CME 0090 origin.

4.3. Comparison with other FD events
Here we perform a cross-check between the CACTus CME catalog, the ring current Dst and the FD events listed
in Lingri et al. (2016). These events are from the rising phase (2010-2013) of solar cycle 24. Basic information on
the selected FD, the CME parameters from the CACTus CME catalog and the ring current Dst indices are shown
in Table 2 of the appendix. The FD parameters are based on the Oulu NM data, the FD data listed in Lingri et al.
(2016) and New-Tupi telescope data.

Initially, we have selected only the CMEs that are estimated to have triggered intense geomagnetic storms with a

Dst below −70 nT. These results are shown in Fig. 12.

In Fig. 12 we can recognize two basic groups: (a) The halo and partial halo events, those with da > 180◦, in this
case, the pa of the events are distributed within a broad range, i.e., from 0 to 360 degrees. (b) The narrow-angle width
events, those with da < 90◦. However, in this case, the pa of the events are restricted to a narrow region, mainly

around pa ∼ 270◦, i.e., on or close to the ecliptic plane.

On the other hand, Fig. 13 shows all the CMEs that triggered FD events with an amplitude equal or above 1% (at
Oulu NM) and for the same time period. Despite a dispersion higher than in the previous case, the CMEs with a
narrow width angle are primarily clustered at the pa around 270◦. This is the case of the 21 June CME 0091 associated
with one of the strongest geomagnetic storms of current solar cycle 24.

5. SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES AND SOLSTICE STORM 2015
Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events are also known as radiation storms, or solar proton events (SPE). Solar
radiation storms typically occur after major eruptions on the Sun because of charged particles accelerating in the solar
atmosphere to very high velocities. Two classes of solar proton events can be distinguished. The ﬁrst is a tiny fraction
of SEP, those with higher velocities, whose acceleration is during the short (typically less than 20 minutes) impulsive
phase of the ﬂare. However, the majority of SEP events are associated with solar protons accelerated by CME shocks
during the gradual phase of the ﬂare (Augusto et al. 2015). The characteristic of the gradual phase is a soft rise and
a long duration decay time of the soft X-ray component.

A SEP with energies above 100 MeV can trigger so-called ground-level events (GLEs). GLEs are observed as particle
excess in the counting rate of ground-level detectors. Three or more stations must observe an increase of 4% or more
in a 3-min moving average (Kuwabara et al. 2006; Souvatzoglou et al. 2009) as the criteria for the classiﬁcation of an
event as a GLE.

The observation of SEP events implies the existence of coronal shocks extending at least ∼ 300◦ (Cliver 1995) and
interplanetary shocks up to ∼ 180◦ at 1 AU (Cane, Richardson and Rosenvinge 1996). Neither of the two consecutive
CMEs that erupted on 21 June 2015 and were linked to a double M class ﬂare on 21 June, responsible for triggering
the severe geomagnetic storm on 22 June, satisﬁed these criteria. We looked for a possible GLE signal in the NMDB
and other ground-based detectors, including New-Tupi and Muonca detectors, but did not ﬁnd the signal.

According to the ACE-SIS and GOES data, there was a radiation storm with onset at 21 June, associated with the
M-class dual ﬂare. The radiation storm reached the S1 (minor) level at 19:36 UT at L1, and one hour later, at 20:38
UT, the S1 level was registered by the (geostationary satellite) GOES. The S1 level indicates that the ﬂux of protons
with energies above 10 MeV equals or exceeds 10 pf u (1 pf u = 1 particle per cm2 s sr). It is also worth noting that a
sudden increase in the speed of the solar wind, from 400 km s−1 to almost 700 km s−1, was observed due to the likely
passage of the CME 0091 ejecta at the L1. This is exactly the signature of the presence of shock waves coinciding with
the magnetic disturbance, accelerating particles of the interplanetary medium and even particles from the radiation
storm itself.

A high-speed magnetized plasma and the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld oriented in the opposite direction can interconnect
through a process that is known as “magnetic reconnection” (Dorelli and Bhattacharjee 2008). The reconnection

process enhances the direct magnetic connection between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. On June 22, this
process occurred due to strong southward IMF of the CME 0091 with the geomagnetic ﬁeld (see top panel on Fig. 14).
An additional increase in the particle ﬂow can lead to a situation when a more signiﬁcant fraction of cosmic rays
is injected into the upper atmosphere reaching up to middle latitudes and producing an increased rate of particles
at ground level. Recent it was reported by GRAPES Collaboration (Mohanty et al. 2016) that the geomagnetic ﬁeld
perturbed via reconnection with the IMF could lead to a sudden lowering of the cutoﬀ rigidities and an enhancement
of the galactic cosmic rays intensity.

The GRAPES Collaboration has reported a short duration bundle of muons in temporal coincidence with the third
impact on 22 June 2015. In addition, there was an increase in the radiation storm level, from S2 (moderate-level) to
S3 (strong-level) in the NOAA storm scale. Fig. 14 summarizes the situation.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
One of the strongest geomagnetic storms of cycle 24 occurred on 22-23 June 2015, i.e., during the summer solstice
time. Starting from 18 June 2015, one of the biggest active regions on the Sun of current solar cycle 24 (NOAA AR
2371) produced several CMEs associated with M-class solar ﬂares, which were observed at areas close to the central
meridian. We analyzed the sequence of events, from the solar activity to FDs measurements. We investigated how
multiple CMEs impacted the Earth, resulting in associated FDs. Our study was primarily based on experimental data
acquired with ground based cosmic ray detectors located in the SAA region. The main results of our analysis were as
follows:

(a) As expected, the FDs events observed by ground-based detectors were associated with the CME impacts. We
found good agreement between our instruments that detected FDs. The ﬁrst and most intense FD occurred on 22
June. The FD intensity (depression) with an amplitude up to 4% was observed by the New-Tupi vertical telescope
and Muonca (in the scaler mode) on 22 June. The El Leoncito cosmic ray detector measured an amplitude of about
3.7%.

(b) We found that the storm showed multi-step development reﬂected in several impacts (shocks) on Earth’s mag-
netosphere. The multiple set of shocks can lead to the growth of an intense geomagnetic storm. We analyzed possible
association between the schocks and the particular CME. The ﬁrst weak impact (on 21 June) was most likely caused
by the 18 June full halo CME 0078. The second impact of 22 June is consistent with the 21 June CME 0090 origin.
Only after the 22 June impact of the narrow CME 0091 (pa ∼ 270◦) was G4 geomagnetic storm triggered. The 25

has stretched the total duration (from the onset time until the recovery time) of the main summer solstice FD for at
least 48 h. There was about 16 h delay between the impact of the CME and the onset of the storm. This observation
suggests that the fourth impact occurred under very special conditions, due to change in the Earth’s space environment
after the preceding CMEs.

(d) In this study we were interested to determine whether the storm features, basic CME properties and FDs were
unusual in any way. For the purpose, we performed a cross-check between the CACTus CME catalog, geomagnetic
storm parameters and the associated FD events from the ascending phase (2010-2013) of solar cycle 24.

Analysis of the pa distribution of all the CMEs that triggered FD events with an amplitude equal or above 1% shows
that there are two peaks in the equatorial region (corresponding to pa 90◦ and 270◦). This result suggests that the
associated CMEs mainly originate from low latitudes.

Analysis of the CMEs that triggered intense geomagnetic storms with a Dst below −70 nT shows that there are
two groups of geoeﬀective CMEs. The ﬁrst group is well known from previous studies, such as in (Gopalswamy 2009).
These CMEs are characterized by (1) high speed shocks, (2) a solar source location close to the central meridian and
(3) a large angular width (mostly halos and partial halos). We can add that the pa distribution is wide. In this paper
we showed the second group. The events show narrow width (da < 90◦) and primarily clustered at the pa around
270◦. This is the case of the 21 June CME 0091.

Our analysis of the FDs associated with intense storms (Dst < −70 nT) suggests that west hemisphere CMEs (pa

close to 270◦) are more geoeﬀective than east hemisphere CMEs.

Using the 2010-2013 FD set, we found an event with similar characteristics (pa ∼ 289◦ and da ∼ 76◦). The very

intense FD (Dst ∼ −133 nT ) occurred on 8 March 2012 and was also caused by a series of CMEs.

(e) In this study we have investigated the 21-24 June radiation storm that reached S3 level on 22 June. We looked
for a possible GLE signal in the NMDB and other ground-based detectors, including New-Tupi and Muonca detectors,
but did not ﬁnd the signal. We look for GLEs (or some particle excesses) associated with these CMEs in the NM
network and other detectors, in all cases the result was negative.

(f) The Sun travels along the ecliptic inclined by 23.5 degrees from the celestial equator. On the day of the Summer
Solstice, the Sun is at furthest point above the celestial equator (23.5 degrees to the equinox). The largest geomagnetic
storm of solar cycle 24 so far occurred near 2015 equinox (so-called St. Patrick’s Day storm). The Summer solstice
event gives us an opportunity to look again at the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld characteristics of CMEs that results in
particular intense events evolving in the varied conditions of the Earth’s space environment

The ground level detectors within the SAA region (New-Tupi and Muonca in Brazil) are running. They have covered
the maximum and the current descending phase of the cycle 24, and the analysis of other transient solar events is in
progress.
