ABSTRACT
Blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of AGN show that ultra-fast outﬂows
with typical velocities v ∼ 0.1c are a common feature of these luminous objects. Such
powerful AGN winds oﬀer an explanation of the observed M − σ relation linking the
mass of the supermassive black hole and the velocity dispersion in the galaxys stellar
bulge. An extended XMM-Newton study of the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143
recently revealed a variable multi-velocity wind. Here we report the detection of a
short-lived, ultrafast inﬂow during the same observation. Previous reports of inﬂows
used single absorption lines with uncertain identiﬁcations, but this new result identiﬁes
an array of resonance absorption lines of highly ionised Fe, Ca, Ar, S and Si, sharing a
common redshift when compared with a grid of realistic photoionization spectra. The
redshifted absorption arises in a column of highly ionized matter close to the black
hole, with a line-of-sight velocity, v ∼ 0.3c, inconsistent with the standard picture of
a plane circular accretion disc. This may represent the ﬁrst direct evidence for chaotic
accretion in AGN, where accretion discs are generally misaligned to the black hole spin.
For suﬃcient inclinations, the Lense-Thirring eﬀect can break the discs into discrete
rings, which then precess, collide and shock, causing near free-fall of gas towards
the black hole. The observed accretion rate for the reported infall is comparable to
the hard X-ray luminosity in PG1211+143 suggesting that direct infall may be a
signiﬁcant contributor to inner disc accretion.

INTRODUCTION

It is now well-established that a supermassive black hole
(SMBH) lies in the centre of most galaxies, and further that
it accretes material through a disc. Over the past 15 years,
observations with a new generation of X-ray Observatories
(Jansen 2001, Mitsuda:2007) have revealed ultra-fast out-
ﬂows (UFOs), probably launched from regions of the disc
accreting at super–Eddington rates (King & Pounds 2003)
where the momentum in the radiation ﬁeld released by accre-
tion can overcome the inward pull from the black hole’s grav-
ity. UFOs appear to be a common component of luminous
AGN (Tombesi et al. 2010, 2011, Goﬀord et al. 2013). With
typical velocities of v ∼ 0.1c, these highly ionized winds
imply signiﬁcant feedback onto the surrounding interstellar
gas, oﬀering a likely explanation of the M − σ relation (Fer-
rarese et al. 2000, Gebhardt et al. 2000), by simultaneously
constraining the growth of a supermassive black hole and

c(cid:13) 2018 RAS

star formation in the central bulge of its host galaxy (King
2003,2005; King & Pounds 2015).

The archetypal UFO is found in the luminous Seyfert
galaxy PG1211+143 (Pounds et al. 2003). To further explore
the properties of this powerful UFO, the XMM-Newton X-
ray Observatory carried out seven full-orbit (∼ 100 ks) ob-
servations over 5 weeks in 2014, with a total on-target ex-
posure of ∼ 630 ks. Full details of observing times, data
reduction procedures and count rates are given in Lobban
et al. (2016). The stacked data revealed a surprisingly com-
plex spectrum, with the hard X-ray pn camera (Strueder
et al. 2001) ﬁnding multiple blue-shifted absorption lines,
identiﬁed with highly ionized Fe between ∼ 6.6keV and 8.8
keV and outﬂow velocities of ∼ 0.06c, ∼ 0.13c and ∼ 0.18c
(Pounds et al. 2016a). Independent support for the multi-
ple outﬂow velocities was found in higher resolution spectra
(Pounds et al. 2016b) using soft-X-ray data from the co-
aligned Reﬂection Grating Spectrometer (RGS :den-Herder
et al. 2001). While all previous UFO detections report a sin-

gle velocity, although with repeated observations sometimes
ﬁnding a diﬀerent value, the 2014 XMM-Newton observa-
tion of PG1211+143 was inconsistent with the unique and
stable outﬂow expected from a static axisymmetric accre-
tion disc (Shakura and Sunyaev 1973, Pounds et al. 2017).
Furthermore, a recent orbit-by-orbit study of the RGS data
(Reeves et al. 2018) has shown signiﬁcant inter-orbit vari-
ability in outﬂow column densities over the 5-week cam-
paign, perhaps providing a further indication of short-term
inner disc variability.

The highly ionized state of such ultra-fast AGN winds
limits strong absorption to the heavier metals, where fea-
tures of Fe stand out because of its high astrophysical abun-
dance. For that reason, all current UFO discoveries essen-
tially rest on the detection of blue-shifted Lyman-α and/or
He-α resonance absorption lines of highly ionized Fe (re-
spective rest energies of 6.70 and 6.96 keV). While spec-
tral modelling, typically over the 2–10 keV band, also in-
cludes absorption in lighter metals such as Ca, S, and Si
(eg. Pounds and Page 2006), little attention has been given
to other spectral features below ∼ 6 keV, where red-shifted
Fe K absorption lines might be seen. The few historical ex-
ceptions (Nandra et al. 1999, Dadina et al. 2005, Reeves et
al. 2005, Cappi et al. 2009, Giustini et al. 2017) are of iso-
lated absorption lines where the identiﬁcation – and hence
velocity – of the absorber remained unclear. In the most
detailed report (Dadina et al. 2005) two (of ﬁve) Beppo-
Sax observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 509 detected
an absorption line at ∼ 5.5 keV (rest-frame), suggesting the
feature was variable on timescales as short as ∼ 20 ks, which
the authors argued was more easily reconciled with inﬂow-
ing matter than with a pure gravitational redshift or failed
jet. Of particular relevance to the present study are uniden-
tiﬁed absorption lines at ∼ 4.56 keV and ∼ 5.33 keV in the
Chandra observation of PG1211+143 (Reeves et al. 2005).
While these earlier reports hint at fast-evolving and compli-
cated dynamics in the inner disc, so far none has provided
compelling evidence for a high velocity inﬂow that could
represent a direct challenge to the standard picture of a cir-
cular, planar disc slowly accreting on to the central black
hole.

However, recent theoretical arguments suggest that
such infall may be common in AGN, where allowing for
the possibility that the accretion disc may be misaligned to
the central black hole spin reveals new physical eﬀects. Nu-
merical simulations of misaligned discs around a spinning
black hole have shown that the Lense-Thirring eﬀect can
overwhelm the internal communication of angular momen-
tum within the disc. This causes the disc to break, leading
to individual rings of gas which precess eﬀectively indepen-
dently – called disc tearing (Nixon et al. 2012, Nixon 2015,
Dogan et al. 2015, Nealon et al. 2015, Dogan et al. 2018).
When these rings interact, their opposed velocity ﬁelds cre-
ate shocks which rob the gas of rotational support, allowing
it to fall inwards towards the black hole where residual an-
gular momentum causes the gas to re-circularise at a smaller
radius.

Motivated by these theoretical ideas and the paucity of
relevant observations, we have carried out a thorough search
for rapidly inﬂowing matter, on a range of timescales, as part
of an on-going orbit-by-orbit analysis of the hard X-ray data
from the 2014 XMM-Newton observation of PG1211+143.

2 REDSHIFTED ABSORPTION

The new analysis is based primarily on the high through-
put pn camera, while checking for consistency - as necessary
- with simultaneous spectral data from the MOS camera
(Turner et al. 2001) and higher resolution spectra from the
RGS.

As in the published outﬂow studies, spectral modelling
uses the XSPEC v12 software package (Arnaud 1996), with
all spectral ﬁts including absorption due to the line-of-sight
Galactic column of NH = 2.85 × 1020cm−2 (Murphy et al.
1996). We assume the reverberation black hole mass esti-
mate of 4×107 M⊙ (Kaspi et al. 2000), and a galaxy redshift
of 0.0809 (Marziani et al. 1996).

The starting point in modelling each pn data set is the
stacked X-ray spectrum (Pounds et al. 2016a), where the
continuum from 1–10 keV is modelled by a double power law,
with discrete spectral features imposed by overlying mat-
ter being compared with grids of pre-computed photoion-
ized absorption and emission spectra, based on the XSTAR
code (Kallman et al. 1996). To facilitate comparison with
previous outﬂow analyses (eg Pounds et al. 2016a), for the
pn and MOS data we use the publically available grid25
(v21), which assumes a power law continuum of Γ = 2 and
a ﬁxed turbulence velocity 200 km s−1, and custom-built
grids derived from the observed source spectrum (Pounds et
al. 2016b) for the RGS spectral analysis. Free parameters
in the spectral ﬁtting include the ionization, column density
and observed redshift (or blueshift) of photoionized matter,
with continuum normalisation also free to vary on re-ﬁtting.
We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant evidence for strongly redshifted
absorption 1 in the ﬁrst observing period (spacecraft orbit
number 2652, or rev2652), but that outcome changed for
rev2659, just two weeks later.

2.1 A strong inﬂow in rev2659

Modelling the 1–10 keV pn spectrum from rev2659 re-
vealed a strong absorption component at the extreme red-
shift ∼0.483±0.008. With a high column density (NH ∼
4.3 × 1023cm−2) and high ionization parameter (log ξ ∼ 3.7
erg cm s−1), the red-shifted absorber is highly signiﬁcant,
its inclusion improving the ﬁt by ∆χ2 of 19/3. The corre-
sponding probability of a false detection (P=4.4 ×10−4) is a
physically robust measure, being based on a comparison of
the observed broad band absorption with a set of physically
realistic model photoionization spectra.

To check that the model was not impaired by some
unknown data artefacts, the redshifted component was re-
moved from the XSTAR model and the ratio of data-to-model
visually examined. Figure 1 (top) reproduces that ratio plot,
showing an array of absorption lines identiﬁed with reso-
nance transitions in H- and He-like ions of Fe, Ca, Ar, S
and Si. The two strongest absorption lines are identiﬁed
with Lyman-α and He-α of Fe, with individual redshifts
closely matching the XSTAR model component, while the ar-
ray as a whole yields a weighted mean observed redshift of
0.476±0.005. The Ca line at ∼2.6 keV is most likely a blend

resolution of Fe K absorption lines with present data, setting a

line energy, obtained by scanning a narrow negative Gaus-
sian across the ratio plot, with the individual line widths
set comparable to the pn detector resolution at each pho-
ton energy. We note the detector resolution corresponds to
an intrinsic line width of order 1500 km s−1 at 5 keV, sub-
stantially greater than the preferred XSTAR model value, in-
dicating the observed absorption line widths are essentially
unresolved in these data.

Allowing for the cosmological redshift of PG1211+143
(0.0809) the observed redshift of 0.48 ± 0.01 corresponds to
a Doppler-corrected inﬂow velocity v∼0.30±0.01c. As this
velocity is substantially higher than any of the 3 contempo-
rary outﬂow velocities, we suggest the matter being a ’failed
outﬂow’ relatively unlikely, since a lower velocity outﬂow -
launched from a larger radius - would have too much angular
momentum to fall back at the higher velocity. The more in-
teresting alternative is absorption in matter accreting from

out-of-the-plane of the disc, and in line of sight to the hard
X-ray continuum source (conventionally assumed to be a
compact hot corona above the inner disc).

In the context of matter falling freely towards the
SMBH, equating the infall velocity to the local free-fall ve-
locity places the absorber near 20 Rg, where Rg is the grav-
itational radius. We note that ∼ 5% of the observed redshift
would be gravitational at that location.

Independent support for the above ﬁnding is potentially
available from the co-aligned MOS camera (Turner et al.
2000), which was operated throughout the 2014 campaign.
An initial check on the rev2659 MOS data did indeed ﬁnd
a highly redshifted absorption component, consistent with
that reported from the pn data analysis, although the out-
ﬂow components are less well constrained due to the lower
sensitivity of the MOS above ∼6 keV. To obtain a common
spectral ﬁt with both data sets, we therefore re-ﬁtted the
pn model, described above, with the addition of the MOS
data, and allowing the joint parameters to vary. The out-
come was positive, with the redshifted absorber increasing
in signiﬁcance (∆χ2 of 26/3), while retaining a similar col-
umn density (NH∼6.3×1023cm−2) and ionization parameter
(log ξ ∼ 3.4 erg cm s−1). The false detection probability for
the redshifted absorption component in the joint spectral ﬁt
is now further reduced with P ≤ 10−5.

2.2 Absorption in the RGS soft x-ray spectrum of

rev2659

Finally, higher resolution soft X-ray spectra (albeit with
lower count rates) from the RGS instrument, also co-aligned
with the pn camera, are examined to check for possible lower
ionization matter in the infalling stream. We recall that de-
tection of cooler embedded matter provided important con-
ﬁrmation of multiple velocities in the outﬂow spectrum of
PG1211+143 (Pounds et al. 2016b).

Again starting with the mean 2014 outﬂow spectrum,
the rev2659 RGS data was re-modelled, now allowing for
an additional red-shifted absorber. That search was suc-

Figure 2. Ratio of RGS data-to-model for rev2659 when absorp-

Absorption lines identiﬁed with the 1s-2p resonance lines of He-
like O and Ne are detected at a redshift consistent with the XSTAR
model value. The broad absorption line at ∼24.2 ˚A corresponds to
a similar redshift when identiﬁed with the Fe-M UTA, although
with lower precision as the rest wavelength of the UTA depends
on the ionization distribution. Narrow emission lines of OVIII Ly-
α and the forbidden line of the OVII triplet also match the model
redshift. The line markers are located at wavelengths correspond-
ing to a redshift of 0.48.

cessful, with a soft X-ray absorption component (∆χ2 of
14/3; P=3 ×10−3) being found at the same extreme redshift
(∼ 0.483 ± 0.003), though with a much lower column density
(NH ∼ 3×1021cm−2) and ionization parameter (log ξ ∼ 0.95
erg cm. s−1). Inclusion of the redshifted absorber improved
the overall 12–35 ˚A soft X-ray spectral ﬁt by ∆χ2 of 14/3,
perhaps again indicating higher density matter embedded
in the primary inﬂow. Interestingly, a soft X-ray emission
component is also marginally signiﬁcant (∆χ2 of 6/2) with
the same redshift.

Conﬁdence in the highly red-shifted soft X-ray absorp-
tion and emisiion components is supported by the detection
of several key features in the spectral residuals, when the
high redshift components are removed from the XSTAR model
ﬁt (Figure 2). While the plot is much ’noisier’ than for the pn
hard X-ray data, the strong 1s-2p resonance absorption lines
of He-like O and Ne are both indicated at a redshift consis-
tent with the XSTAR model value, while the broad absorption
line at ∼24.2 ˚A corresponds to a similar redshift when iden-
tiﬁed with the Fe-M UTA, albeit with lower precision as the
rest wavelength of the UTA depends on the ionization dis-
tribution. Narrow emission lines identiﬁed with of O Ly-α
and the forbidden line of the OVII triplet also match the
same inﬂow redshift.

Two less strongly red-shifted components are also found
in the RGS spectrum, at z∼0.19±0.01 (∆χ2 of 17/3: P=7 ×
10−4) and z∼0.17±0.01 (∆χ2 of 15/3: P= 1.8×10−3). While
the lower implied velocities might simply represent a line of
sight at a larger angle to the ﬂow stream, the required large
deviation in the ﬂow vector seems unlikely so close to the
SMBH.

Alternatively, assuming each ﬂow is along the line of

sight, the corresponding inﬂow velocities would ∼0.080c and
∼0.097c. Both components are highly ionized, with logξ
∼3.4 erg cm s−1, similar to that for the pn detection, but
with respective column densities of NH ∼ 4.6 × 1021cm−2
and NH ∼ 1.1 × 1021cm−2, much less than in the pn detec-
tion.

An intriguing speculation is that the lower velocity and
column density of these soft X-ray inﬂows represent the pri-
mary, highly ionized ﬂow seen along a diﬀerent sight line
(in this case to the soft X-ray continuum), providing an up-
stream view through an accelerating ﬂow approaching the
SMBH. Support for that conjecture is provided by the ab-
sence of a higher energy spectral counterpart to the lower
redshift soft X-ray absorbers in the pn data.

If a true up-stream measure, the lower velocity of the
highly ionized soft X-ray absorber, v∼0.10c, would corre-
spond to a radial distance for the absorber of ∼200 Rg,
conceivably on a sight-line to the larger scale, thermal disc
emission. The much lower column density might then be
qualitatively consistent with a converging - as well as accel-
erating inﬂow. While such deductions are limited by having
only two spectral data points, the potential of future obser-
vations with higher spectral resolution and photon grasp is
clear.

3 EVIDENCE OF REDSHIFTED

ABSORPTION IN LATER ORBITS

The pn data from the third observation, in rev2661, was
examined as above, ﬁnding only an upper limit for an in-
ﬂow at a redshift near ∼0.48, with (NH ≤ 7 × 1021cm−2).
There was, however, a signiﬁcant redshifted component at z
∼0.36±0.01, with a similar ionisation parameter (log ξ ∼ 3.5
erg cm s−1, but lower column density (NH ∼ 1.5×1023 cm−2)
than in rev2659. Adding this red-shifted component to the
XSTAR spectral model improved the ﬁt statistic by ∆χ2 of
9/3 (Table 2). The physical reality of this ionized absorber
was again supported by the identiﬁcation of resonance ab-
sorption lines of He- and H-like ions of Fe, Ca, S and Si, with
measured redshifts consistent with the XSTAR value. Assum-
ing a ﬂow close to the line of sight to the hard X-ray corona,
the inﬂow velocity in rev2661 would be v∼ 0.23± 0.01c.
While it is not possible to relate this inﬂow to the strong
component seen in rev2659, the signiﬁcant change in both
inﬂow velocity and column density over ∼4 days suggests a
separate inﬂow, and ﬁne spatial or temporal structure in the
ﬂow close to the SMBH.

To complete the search for redshifted absorption, the
pn data analysis was repeated for the remaining four XMM-
Newton orbits, revs2663, 2664, 2666 and 2670, spaced at
intervals of ∼4, ∼2, ∼4 and ∼8 days, respectively. Signif-
icant absorption was found at z ∼0.34±0.02 in rev 2666,
but with a lower ionisation parameter and column density
(than rev 2661). Table 2 summarises the pn inﬂow detec-
tions, with that in rev2659 being the most remarkable, in
terms of redshift and a large and variable column density,
with the simultaneous MOS and RGS data providing inde-
pendent support for the ∼0.30c inﬂow.

All redshift (and inﬂow velocity) measurements are for-
mally lower limits, as they assume the ﬂow is aligned with
the line of sight. However, we suggest this is likely to be the

feasible, with the hard X-ray source being viewed through 3
independently expanding shells of ionized gas.

Detection of an ultra-fast inﬂow

4 DISCUSSION

While several previous observations have suggested the pres-
ence of single redshifted absorption lines in AGN X-ray spec-
tra, we report here the ﬁrst detection of a physically realistic
redshifted absorption line spectrum, consistent with highly
ionized matter falling inwards at v∼0.3c. Such an unam-
biguous detection of strongly red-shifted X-ray absorption
in an AGN provides direct evidence for substantial highly
ionized matter close to - and apparently converging on -
the SMBH. Variability on timescales of hours, as described
below, indicates ﬁne spatial or temporal structure in the
matter crossing the line of sight. Here we brieﬂy consider
the implication of this result, and why such clear evidence
has remained elusive until now.

The detection of ultra-fast and highly ionized outﬂows
(UFOs) in early X-ray spectra of the luminous, narrow line
Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 (Pounds et al. 2003) and QSO
PDS 456 (Reeves et al. 2003), opened a new ﬁeld of study
of AGN, made possible by the uniquely high throughput of
X-ray spectrometers on ESA’s XMM-Newton X-ray Obser-
vatory, launched in late 1999. King and Pounds (2003, 2015)
note that such winds are a natural result of a high accretion
rate, with excess matter being driven oﬀ by radiation pres-
sure when the accretion rate exceeds the local Eddington
limit (Shakura and Sunyaev 1973).

While this picture provides a satisfactory explanation of
most UFOs, with each observation yielding a unique wind
velocity, an extended 5-week study of PG1211+143 in 2014
found a more complex outﬂow proﬁle, with velocities of
∼0.06c, ∼0.13c and ∼0.18c detected in the stacked data set.
Such complexity was clearly inconsistent with a wind pro-
ﬁle launched from the classical (ﬂat axisymmetric) accretion
disc of Shakura & Sunyaev, suggesting some intrinsic disc in-
stability or rapidly variable accretion rate in the inner disc.
As noted above, rapidly varying accretion could be a direct
consequence of the way in which AGN accrete, where matter
falls towards the SMBH with essentially random orientations
(King and Pringle 2006, 2007).

In that case Lense-Thirring precession will cause mis-
aligned orbits to precess around the black hole spin vec-
tor, with the inner disc warping and rings of matter break-
ing free. Collisions between neighbouring rings might then
lead to matter falling inwards to a new radius deﬁned by
its residual angular momentum, where it may form a new
disc. Simulations suggest material added to the inner disc
from the ‘disc-tearing’ region can result in a substantial
increase in the local accretion rate, allowing an otherwise
sub-Eddington ﬂow to become brieﬂy ’super-Eddington’. In
that regard it is interesting to note that the distribution of
UFO velocites from the XMM-Newton and Suzaku archival
searches (King and Pounds 2015; ﬁg.4) is consistent with the
expected range of tearing radius. With precession timescales
(for a black hole mass 4 × 107M⊙ and spin parameter 0.5)
predicted to be of order weeks for radii of order 50 Rg, to
a few years for radii of order 200 Rg (Nixon et al. 2012),
the simultaneous detection of 3 primary wind velocities in
the 2014 XMM-Newton observation of PG1211+143 appears

c(cid:13) 2018 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

We suggest the detection of strongly red-shifted X-ray
absorption spectra, reported here, may represent the ﬁrst
direct observational evidence of disc tearing and thereby of
the importance of random or ’chaotic accretion’ in AGN.
While the observation is of high signiﬁcance only in the
XMM-Newton orbit rev2659, the extreme redshift (∼0.48)
and inﬂow velocity (∼0.3c) indicates absorption in a signiﬁ-
cant body of matter plunging towards the SMBH at ∼20Rg.
Conﬁdence in that detection is increased when the indepen-
dent MOS data are included in a joint spectral spectral ﬁt,
while further support is provided by the RGS detection of a
smaller column of less ionized (presumably, higher density)
matter, co-moving with the primary inﬂow.

The transient nature of the rev2659 inﬂow largely ex-
plains why a compelling detection has not been reported
before. Isolated claims are not uncommon, however, with
several single line detections noted in the Introduction, and
both XMM-Newton and Suzaku archival searches ﬁnding -
but not discussing - transient absorption lines in the region
occupied by red-shifted Fe K lines. Uniquely, the observa-
tion in rev2659 has both a suﬃciently large redshift and
high column density to reveal multiple absorption lines that
- when matched with resonance lines of Fe, Ca, Ar, S and
Si - share a common redshift. In quantifying that spectrum,
the XSTAR analysis is key, since only by comparison with a
set of physically realistic ionized absorption spectra can the
signiﬁcance be properly assessed. A valuable bonus of such
detailed modelling is in quantifying the key parameters (ion-
ization, column density, apparent redshift) of the ﬂow.

In the context of chaotic accretion, where disc tearing
and subsequent shocking is predicted to lead to streams of
matter falling towards the SMBH from essentially random
directions, the highly variable nature of redshifted absorp-
tion, seen along a sight-line to the centrally located hard
X-ray continuum source, is perhaps no surprise. As each
stream plunges towards the black hole the increasing den-
sity will allow a greater fraction of the accreting matter to
pass across the line of sight. While the frequency of detec-
tions during the 5-week observation of PG1211+143 suggests
multiple events, the data from rev 2659 oﬀers the best quan-
titative measure of an individual accreting stream, with the
predicted timescales for disc tearing placing this in terms of
the overall accretion rate of PG1211+143.

If the conditions for disc tearing are satisﬁed, the infall
of a single gas cloud should be detectable for a time of or-
der ∼ R/c, at intervals of ∼ ω−1
LT (∼ 200r s and ∼ 200r3 s
respectively, for a BH mass 4 × 107M⊙, where r = R/Rg).
For r ∼ 200, we can expect the observed inﬂow to be main-
tained for much of the 100 ks rev2659 observation, but not
over the 4 day gap to the subsequent observation, in rev2661.
To check this prediction we re-examined the rev2659 data in
3 roughly equal intervals, ﬁnding that – while maintaining a
consistent redshift – the column density rose strongly from
the ﬁrst through to the third time sections, with the ﬁnal
∼ 30 ks being nearly optically thick to Thomson scattering.
In contrast, by rev2661 the v ∼ 0.3c inﬂow was gone.

We use the higher resolution ﬂow data of rev2659 (Ta-
ble 2) to estimate the peak mass ﬂow rate, where – as a
stream of matter plunges towards the black hole – its in-
creasing compactness ensures the third segment represents

a maximum fraction passing through the line of sight. We as-
sume a cylindrical inﬂow element at a radial distance 20Rg,
with length 5Rg constrained by the well-deﬁned velocity,
and diameter 2Rg to allow a reasonable chance of detec-
tion along a line of sight to the hard X-ray source. The
mean particle density is then NH /5Rg, and the observed
mass element min = (volume × density × proton mass) ∼
g × (3.6 × 1023/Rg) × 1.7 × 10−24 g. For a black hole mass
15R3
of 4×107M⊙, Rg ∼ 6×1012 cm and min ∼ 3.3×1026 g. Since
the observed element will cross the line of sight in ∼ 3000 s,
the instantaneous observed inﬂow mass rate is ∼ 1023 g s−1.
Assuming an accretion eﬃciency η ∼ 0.1, the observed
accretion rate would yield a luminosity of ∼ 1043 erg s−1,
comparable to the hard X-ray continuum of PG1211+143,
the primary inner disc emission component. In the context
of disc tearing each pair of torn-oﬀ rings may interact many
times, producing many clouds and a more continuous stream
of material, although with only a small fraction likely to fall
through an observer’s line of sight.

Evidence for additional inﬂowing matter found in two
of the remaining 5 XMM-Newton observations in 2014, with
lower velocities and column densities (than in rev2659)
might indicate infalling matter further from the SMBH. De-
tails of all the positive detections are listed in Table 2, re-
vealing a picture of one remarkably strong – and rapidly
variable – inﬂow (in rev2659), which we suggest represents
an infalling matter stream within ∼ 20Rg and lying close
to the line of sight, and lower redshift absorption ∼4 and
∼14 days later, perhaps representing matter still having too
much angular momentum to accrete.

Finally, we note the most likely alternative to the above
picture, that of a failed outﬂow, is unlikely given that the
inﬂow velocity in rev 2659 is much higher than any observed
outﬂow component in PG1211+143. Assuming that the lat-
ter arise from larger disc radii (with corresponding escape
velocities), that material would have too much angular mo-
mentum to acquire the higher in-fall velocity observed. For
the ’failed-wind’ model to explain the data then requires the
same velocity outﬂow to be unobservable for precisely the
period in which the inﬂow is observed; that seems unlikely,
requiring an uncomfortable degree of ﬁne-tuning.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The detection of strongly red-shifted X-ray absorption in
data from an extended XMM-Newton observation of the
luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 has provided com-
pelling evidence for the inﬂow of matter at v ∼ 0.3c. We

Figure 3. Characteristic disc structure from the simulation of
a misaligned disc around a spinning black hole. The outermost
regions are warped and remain misaligned. Inside this, several
rings have broken free and are freely precessing through the Lense-
Thirring eﬀect. The innermost material has fallen from the shocks
which occur between rings, and is aligned to the central black hole
spin (it is the misaligned component of angular momentum which
is cancelled in the shocks – and transferred to the hole through
precession). Depending on the observer’s line of sight, the infalling
matter may or may not obscure the central emitting regions. Note
that the black hole spin vector is drawn as an arrow up the page,
but this is the projection on to the page. The black hole spin
vector points out towards the reader as well as in the direction
drawn, such that the vector is normal to the inner-most ring of
gas.

suggest a possible origin for the inﬂow in the form of disc
tearing, arising when an accretion disc misaligned to the spin
plane of the SMBH precesses due to the Lense-Thirring ef-
fect (frame-dragging), with the precession close to the hole
being fast enough for individual rings to break oﬀ (Nixon
et al. 2012, Dogan et al. 2018). Collisions between indepen-
dently precessing rings then cause shocks and a loss of rota-
tional support and the subsequent infall of disc gas. If this
picture is conﬁrmed, there are strong implications for the
fuelling of AGN, and the evolution of SMBH masses and
spins. For example, misaligned or ‘chaotic’ accretion would
in general allow the spin to remain low (King et al. 2008),
allowing eﬃcient mass growth for the black hole. This might
then remove the need for massive SMBH seeds in the early
Universe (King & Pringle 2006, 2007).

of hours, helps explain why a compelling detection has not
been reported before. It may also be relatively rare to have
a sight-line to the hard X-ray source that passes through
infalling matter so close to the black hole, and hence with
such a high particle density, as we found in rev2659.

Looking ahead, X-ray absorption spectra obtained over
diﬀerent sight lines, with high cadence and resolution, to-
gether with parallel advances in theory and computation,
oﬀer the exciting prospect of mapping the ﬁne structure of
ionized ﬂows and accretion close to the SMBH. The high
spectral resolution of the microcalorimeter planned for the
forthcoming Japanese XRISM mission will be well matched
for studying the highly ionized matter characteristic of fast
inﬂows. Such new data together with new and a broader
search of archival XMM-Newton observations should provide
the best opportunity for further exploration of accretion disc
physics and black hole growth in AGN prior to the launch
of Athena, a decade hence.
