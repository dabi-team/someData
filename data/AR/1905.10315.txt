ABSTRACT 
The  augmented-reality  head-mounted  display  (e.g.,  Microsoft 
HoloLens)  is  one  of  the  most  innovative  technologies  in 
multimedia  and  human-computer  interaction  in  recent  years. 
Despite the emerging research of its applications on engineering, 
education,  medicines,  to  name  a  few,  its  impact  on  users’ 
movement  behavior 
is  still  underexplored.  The  movement 
behavior, especially for office workers with sedentary lifestyles, is 
related to many chronic conditions. Unlike the traditional screens, 
the  augmented-reality  head-mounted  display  (AR-HMD)  could 
enable  mobile  virtual  screens,  which  might  impact  on  users’ 
movement behavior. In this paper, we present our initial study  to 
explore  the  impact  of  AR-HMDs  on  users’  movement  behavior. 
We compared the differences of macro-movements (e.g., sit-stand 
transitions)  and  micro-movements  (e.g.,  moving 
the  head) 
between  two  experimental  modes  (i.e.,  spatial-mapping  and  tag-
along)  with  a  dedicated  trivial  quiz  task  using  HoloLens.  The 
study  reveals  interesting  findings:  strong  evidence  supports  that 
participants  had  more  head-movements  in  the  tag-along  mode 
where higher simplicity and freedom of moving the virtual screen 
were given; body position/direction changes show the same effect 
with  moderate  evidence,  while  sit-stand  transitions  show  no 
difference  between  the  two  modes  with  weak  evidence.  Our 
results 
research 
imply  several  design  considerations  and 
opportunities for future work on the ergonomics of AR-HMDs in 
the perspective of health.

1  Introduction 
Augmented-reality  head-mounted  displays 
(AR-HMD,  e.g., 
HoloLens) have been popular in both academia and industry. This 
multimedia  platform  enables  novel  interfaces  between  users  and 
information, which brings immersive and in-situ user experience. 
However,  the  ergonomics, especially  the  health  impacts  of  using 
these devices, is still underexplored.   

to  our  spines  could  contribute 

Since the beginning of the PC era, human labor work has been 
increasingly replaced by machines and computers. Inactive office 
work  becomes  many  people’s  lifestyle.  However,  human’s  body 
cannot  evolve  so  fast  as  the  modern  industry  that  many  chronic 
diseases  become  pervasive.  In  the  short  term, static postures that 
to 
cause  much  pressure 
musculoskeletal  disorders  (e.g.,  back  and  neck  pain)  [14].  In  the 
long  term,  inactive  lifestyles  are  related  to  obese  [11],  type  2 
diabetes  [27],  cardiovascular  diseases  [37],  and  even  certain 
cancers (e.g., colon cancer [18]). Recent studies [22] showed that 
even  meeting 
(PA) 
recommendations (i.e., 150-300 minutes of moderate intensity PA 
or  75-150  minutes  of  vigorous  intensity  PA  per  week)  cannot 
compensate  the  bad  effect  of  sedentary  behavior  (prolonged-
sitting) at work. 

the  well-established  physical  activity 

Therefore,  improving  individuals’  inactive  work  style  is 
urgent. Both academia and industry have studied many methods - 
from  changing  working  policies  and  physical  environments  [36] 
to  providing  dedicated  education  and  reminders  [13].  According 
to  Fogg’s  Behavioral  Model  (FBM)  [10],  human  behaviors  are 
determined  by  three  factors:  ability,  motivation,  and  triggers. 
Lacking  one  of  these  factors  will lead  to  the  failure  of  the  target 
illustrated  that 
behavior.  A  recent  systematic  review  [36] 
education plus point-of-prompt PC reminders could be effective in 
reducing  sedentary  behavior  at  work.  This  mixed  intervention 
strategy  enhances  two  factors  in  FBM:  motivation  and  triggers. 
Regarding the third factor, ability, changing workplace settings or 
adding  facilities  (e.g.,  using  sit-stand  work  station  or  treadmill) 
could be helpful. One way to increase users’ ability is to make the 
target behavior easier to do, which is the focus of this paper. 

Despite  the  approaches  to  solving  the  inactivity  problem  in 
office work, we have to ask what causes the inactive lifestyle. The 
reasons could be multiple: the limited room space, being quiet  to 
avoid  interrupting  colleagues,  focusing  on  tasks,  and  so  on.

However,  we  believe  the  fixed  computer  screen  is  a  non-
negligible  factor.  To  visually  obtain  the  information  from  the 
computer,  we  have to  stay  close  to  the  screen.  Even using  a  sit-
stand work station with multiple screens, users’ postures are still 
restricted  by  the  screen’s  position  and  size.  Therefore,  allowing 
users to move the screen freely could be a way to encourage their 
movements  during  work,  which  corresponds  to  the  factor  of 
ability in FBM. The AR-HMD (e.g., HoloLens) could enable free 
movements with the virtual screen in the device. 

Therefore, we are eager to explore the potential impact of AR-
HMDs on users’ movement behavior at office work, which could 
be applied to  improve the screen-based office workers’ health. A 
representative of AR-HMDs is Microsoft HoloLens. It enables the 
experience of holograms, which is  a new visual media with high 
potentials  in  human-computer  interaction.  Four  features  of 
HoloLens  could  meet the requirements  of  our study  design:  self-
contained  (wireless),  spatial-awareness,  movement-awareness, 
and  augmented  reality.  In  this  paper,  we  will  present  our 
exploratory study to answer the following research questions: 

1.  Will  higher  simplicity  and  freedom  of  moving  the  virtual 
screen in HoloLens lead to more movements of the users? 
2.  What are the main factors affecting users’ movements when 

using the virtual screen in HoloLens?

 Related Work 
AR-HMDs  combine  the  advantages  of  two  technologies: 
augmented  reality  (AR)  and  the  head-mounted  display  (HMD). 
The emerging research of AR-HMDs has enabled applications on 
education  [35], engineering  [32],  medicine  [3], and so  on  [4,26]. 
Although increasing work is focused on novel applications of AR-
HMDs, the study of their impacts on human health is limited.  

Yuan and colleagues  [39] systematically reviewed the HMD-
caused  visual  discomfort,  indicating  that  the  exposure  to  HMDs 
resulted  in  higher  visual  discomfort  (i.e.,  simulator  sickness  and 
visual strain) compared with exposure to traditional displays such 
as TV and desktop computer displays. However, this review only 
covered  studies  using  virtual  reality  HMDs.  There 
is  no 
systematic  review  of  the  visual  discomfort impact by  AR-HMDs 
due  to  the  lack  of  related  empirical  studies.  In  a  recent  paper, 
Vovk  et  al.  [34]  conducted  an  experiment  using  HoloLens  with 
142  subjects  in  three  different  industries  (i.e.,  aviation,  medical, 
and  space),  finding 
that  HoloLens  causes  only  negligible 
symptoms of simulator sickness across all participants.  

Focusing  on  users’  postures,  recently,  Aromma  et  al.  [1] 
reported  a  study  evaluating  a  tablet-based  AR  system  in 
maintenance work regarding human factors and ergonomics. Their 
study  showed that  the users  adopted  varied  kinds  of  postures,  of 
which  some  postures  may  increase  the  risk  of  musculoskeletal 
disorders  in  the  long  term.  However,  this  study  has  two 
limitations:  the  selected  task  only  took  20-30  minutes;  the 
maintenance  task  in  the  study  largely  determined  the  users' 
selected  postures.  In  other  words,  the  study  was  too  short  while 
the  task  did  not  allow  much  freedom  of  users’  movements  and 

postures.  In  our  study,  we  address  the  limitations  by  designing 
dedicated virtual-screen based task using HoloLens. 

Although  the  focus  of  this  paper  is  exploring  the  potential 
impact  of  AR-HMDs  on  users’  movement  behavior,  the  goal 
behind  is to  improve  users’ health in  office  work.  Therefore,  we 
also  discuss 
focused  on  posture 
related  work 
monitoring/guiding and physical activity promotion in office work, 
which  could  inspire  the  ergonomics  research  of  postures  and 
movements using AR-HMDs. 

some 

that 

In  a  recent  paper  [38],  Wu  and  colleagues  proposed 
ActiveErgo  using  sensors and  an  automatically  adjustable  screen 
to  improve  users’  sitting  postures.  The  study  of  ActiveErgo 
showed 
the 
the  participants  need  support 
ergonomics  guidelines.  However,  although  the  right  posture  is 
helpful  to  reduce  musculoskeletal  pain,  prolonged  sitting  or 
standing  is  still  detrimental  for  health.  Increasing  evidence  [2,6] 
suggests  that a dynamic  work  style  –  e.g.,  reducing sitting  while 
increasing  sit-stand  transitions  –  is  superior  to  only  sitting  or 
standing. 

to  follow 

To  promote  physical  activity  at  work,  Probst  presented  the 
Active  Office  [28],  where  new  interaction  technologies  were 
designed to  enable  more  diverse  movements in  office  work  than 
the  traditional  point-and-click  interaction.  For  example,  a  user 
controls a PC through the movements of her/his body (e.g., tilting, 
rotating, bouncing) while sitting on an adjustable office chair with 
sensors. The proposed technologies in Active Office were focused 
on  the  interaction  between  users  and  fixed  screens,  which  could 
still  limit  users’  movements  during  their  office  work.  However, 
the  idea  of  integrating  more  movements  to  the  office  work 
routines also applies in the ergonomics design for AR-HMDs.

 Study Design 

3.1 

 Device 

Several  AR-HMDs  are  available  in  the  consumer  market 
recently,  e.g., Microsoft  HoloLens1, Magic  Leap  One2, and  HTC 
Vive  Pro3.  As  introduced  earlier,  HoloLens  is  a  self-contained 
AR-HMD, which was released by Microsoft in 2016. In our study, 
we use the HoloLens due to its rich development documents and 
its  large  community  of  AR-HMD  research.  HoloLens  uses  the 
head gaze to control the virtual cursor and the air-tap hand gesture 
(or a remote clicker) to select the virtual icons.  It also has several 
limitations,  e.g.,  the  small  field  of  view  and  the  weight.  We 
considered these limitations when we design the task for our study. 

3.2 

 Task 

Since  we  want  to  explore  the  effect  of  the  simplicity  and 
freedom  of  moving  the  virtual  screen  in  HoloLens  on  users’ 
movement behavior, we need to design the task that minimizes the 
impact of other factors. In the review of Yuan and colleagues [39],

they discussed the effect of HMDs’ optical characteristics (system 
features),  participants’  gender  (individual  characteristics),  task 
duration  and  content  (task  characteristics)  on  users’  visual 
discomfort.  We  believe  these  factors  will  impact  on  users’ 
movement  behavior  as  well.  Therefore,  we  considered  these 
factors in our study design. 

We used a trivial quiz on a 2D virtual screen  as the user task 
in  our  study  (see  Figure  1).  The  quiz  contains  600  hundred 
questions,  which  took  around  one  hour  to  finish.  We  intently 
chose  interesting  questions  to  decrease  the  boringness  and 
increase participants’ concentration during the study. This task is 
to  simulate  a  simple  office  work  with  moderate  cognitive  load. 
The  reason  for  choosing  the  task  based  on  a  2D  virtual  screen 
instead  of  3D  objects  is  to  avoid  the  effect  of  the  3D  object  on 
users’  movements.  To  answer  one  question  in  the  quiz,  a  user 
should  gaze  at  the  answer  button  then  press  the  remote  clicker. 
Using the  click  instead  of  the air-tap  gesture is  to avoid  the arm 
fatigue after long-period use.  

Figure 1: An question example in the trivial quiz. 

HoloLens  has  a  30-degree  horizontal  and  17-degree  vertical 
field of view, which is much smaller than the human eyes’ field of 
view. Therefore, we made the virtual screen a bit smaller than the 
view  area.  Thus,  it  required  slight  head  movement  to  select  the 
buttons on the screen, which is to minimize the effect of the field 
of view on users’ head movements. 

We used two modes – spatial-mapping [24] and tag-along [25] 
- to provide different levels of simplicity and freedom of moving 
the virtual screen. In the spatial-mapping mode, users can put the 
virtual  screen  to  any  position  on  the  walls  within  a  given  area 
(around 4 x 4 meters) in a room (see Figure 2). The visual range 
to  the  virtual  screen  is  from  0.85  to  3.1  meters  away  due  to  the 
limit of the depth-perception capacity in HoloLens. Differently, in 
the  tag-along  mode,  the  virtual  screen  automatically  follows  the 
user  when  it  is  out  of  the  view  frustum  as  the  user  moves. 
Otherwise, the virtual screen stays straight to the user’s viewpoint 
at two-meter away. Besides, the spatial-mapping only allows users 
to  attach the  virtual  screen  on  the  wall  in the  given  room,  while 
the  virtual  screen  has  not  the  limit  in  the  tag-along  mode.  To 
conclude, both the modes allow users to control the virtual screen, 
but  the  tag-along  mode  provides  more  simplicity  (automatic 
following) and freedom (any posture of the virtual screen).  

There were a table and an ergonomic chair in the study room. 
The users could sit, stand, and walk using any postures during the 
one-hour task. As we aimed to observe users’ voluntary behavior, 
we did not use any indicators or reminders during the study.

3.3 

 Participants and Procedure 

We  conducted  the  study  in  February  2019.  We  recruited  ten 
healthy  adults  (female=5,  age=27.2±2.9)  from  our  university 
using  emails  and  social  networks.  All  the  participants  had  no 
experience of using HoloLens before the study. 

Before the users started the task, we assessed the participants’ 
perceived  habit  strength  using  the  self-report  index  of  habit 
strength  index  [33]  and  gave  them  a  short  introduction  of  the 
adverse  effect  of  inactive  lifestyle  on  health.  We  then  told  the 
participants they should focus on the quiz and choose the position 
and posture as they like during the study. They could see the score 
on the corner of the virtual screen during the study (See Figure 1). 
Then  the  participants  signed  the  informed  consent  form,  which 
told them the usage of the collected data and that we would give 
20 euros to each participant as compensation after the study.  

The  study  consisted  of  two  appointments  on  two  successive 
days for each participant. We randomly chose five participants to 
use the spatial-mapping mode at the first appointment and then the 
tag-along  mode  at  the  second  appointment.  The  other  five 
participants  used  the  two  modes  in  the  opposite  sequence.  The 
questions in the quiz were randomized each time. The cross-over 
study  design  was to  balance the  potential  novelty  effect  of  using 
HoloLens on the two modes. Most of the participants attended the 
two  appointments  at  the  same  time  on  the  two  successive  days, 
which  is  to  avoid  the  potential  effect  of  the  day  time  on  the 
participants’ behavior. For example, a participant might prefer to 
sit  down  in  the  evening  due  to  tiredness.  Two  participants  were 
exceptional  because  of  their  schedule  limitation.  Therefore,  we 
counterbalanced their study time for the two modes. After the quiz, 
we  assessed  participants’  workload  using 
the  NASA-TLX 
questionnaire  [17].  The  participants  were  allowed  to  drop  the 
study or take a break if they feel uncomfortable when wearing the 
device during the study. 

At  the  end  of  each  appointment,  we  conducted  a  semi-
structural  interview  with  each  participant,  which  took  around  30 
minutes. The questions in the interview included:  

 
 
 
 
 
 
WOODSTOCK’18, June, 2018, El Paso, Texas USA 

F. Surname et al. 

1.  How did you adjust the positions of the virtual screen? 
2.  How did you choose your position and postures? 
3.  Which mode do you prefer? And why? 
4.  Which  features  would  you  like to improve  or add in the 

future AR applications on HoloLens? 

We used the last two questions only  at the end of the second 
appointment.  The  interview  provided  us  more  insights  about  the 
participants’ behavior, in addition to objective measurements. 

3.4 

 Measurements 

We recorded the participants’ behavior during the study using 
two cameras to cover the study room. Besides the videos, we also 
recorded  the  postures  of  HoloLens  using  the  built-in  inertial 
sensors during the study, which corresponded to the participants’ 
head postures.  

sit-stand 

To  quantitatively  analyze  participants’  movement  behavior, 
we  borrowed  the  concepts  of  macro-movements  and  micro-
movements  from  Probst’s  work  [8],  where  she  used  the  macro 
level  and  the  micro  level  to  categorize  users’  movements  in  the 
office work environment. We developed a scheme (see Table 1) to 
code  the  participants’  movements  from  the  recorded  videos.  Sit-
stand  transitions  are  the  movements  a  participant  sitting  in  the 
chair from a standing posture or standing up from a sitting posture.    
We  regarded  the  posture  of  leaning  to  the  wall  or  the  table  as 
standing  when  counting 
transitions.  Body 
the 
position/direction  changes  refer  to  the  movements  a  participant 
moving  her/his  body  or  the  chair  (while  sitting)  to  another 
position  or  direction.  Macro-movements  require  large  muscle 
groups  working  together.  By  contrast,  micro-movements  require 
less  muscle effort,  e.g.,  moving  the  head,  legs,  or  torso postures. 
We  particularly  selected  the  movement  of  adjusting  HoloLens 
because it is caused by the discomfort of wearing HoloLens. We 
have  to  separate  it  from  other  head  movements,  which  includes 
neck-relaxing  movements  and  intently  moving  the  virtual  screen 
in  HoloLens.  We  did  not  count  the  movements  of  clicking  the 
remote  clicker  or  the  air-tap  gesture  because  they  were  only 
related to  the  participants’  speed  of  answering  the  questions and 
independent to the mode.

coding scheme.

One  author  coded  the  videos  when  recording  the  study 
procedure.  After  the  study,  we  invited  one  research  assistant 
(objective  coder)  to  randomly  code  a  subset  of  the  participants’ 
video data  [16,23] and then calculated the intra-class correlation 
(ICC)  [31]  of  the  two  coders.  As  we  were  only  interested  in the 

within-subject  difference  between  the  two  experimental  modes, 
we  chose  the  consistency  between  the  two  coders  to  test  the 
coding  reliability.    We  selected  two-hour  video  data  for  training 
the objective coder and five-hour video data for the formal coding. 
The  ICCs  was  calculated  for  all  the  movement  categories:  sit-
stand transitions (ICC = 1.00, p = 0.000), body position/direction 
changes  (ICC  =  0.79,  p  =  0.031),  the  overall  macro-movements 
(ICC  =  0.92,  p  =  0.005),  adjusting  HoloLens  (ICC  =  0.83,  p  = 
0.020),  head  movements  (ICC  =  0.81,  p  =  0.026),  micro-
movements  excluding  the  head-related  ones  (ICC  =  0.08, 
p=0.444),  and  the  overall  micro-movements  (ICC  =  -0.35, 
p=0.754).  The  coding  consistency  is  good  (ICC  >  0.75)  for  the 
most  categories.  However,  the  coding  for  the  micro-movements 
excluding  the  head-related  ones  showed  poor  reliability,  which 
also caused poor reliability of the overall micro-movements. The 
large  variance  of  the  participants’  movement  habits  is  the  main 
difficulty  of coding the micro-movements, e.g., rotating the chair 
slightly,  shaking  legs,  swing  body  slightly.  Therefore,  we  only 
focus on the measurements with good reliability in data analysis.  

 Statistical Analysis 

4 
The  conventional  null-hypothesis  significance  tests  provide  little 
information  when  the  result  is  not  statistically  significant  –  only 
the  alternative  hypothesis  is  tested  [7].  Non-significant  results 
might  support  a  null  hypothesis  over  the  alternative,  or  the  data 
are  just  insensitive.  By  contrast,  Bayes  factors  [9]  compare  the 
extent to what the samples support two hypotheses (e.g., equal or 
different). Besides, Bayesian  methods also allow more principled 
conclusions from small-n studies of novel techniques in the field 
of human-computer interaction [20]. Therefore, we use the Bayes 
factor (BF) in addition to the  p-value [15] and Cohen’s d [12] to 
report and interpret the results. We use JASP4 (Version 0.9.2) for 
data  analysis  due  to  its  ability  of  both  the  conventional  null-
hypothesis  significance  test  and  the  corresponding  Bayesian 
analysis. For readers who are not familiar with Bayes factors, here 
we provide a short introduction. The definition of the Bayes factor 
is shown in Formula 1 as below.  

𝐵𝐹01 = 𝑃(𝐻0 | 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)
𝑃(𝐻1 | 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)

  or  𝐵𝐹10 = 𝑃(𝐻1 | 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)
𝑃(𝐻0 | 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)

(1) 

The  Bayes  factor  is  a  ratio  of  the  likelihood  probabilities. 
𝑃(𝐻0 | 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎) is  the  probability  of  the  null  hypothesis  given  the 
data,  while  𝑃(𝐻1 | 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)  is  the  probability  of  the  alternative 
hypothesis  given  the  data.  The  Bayes  factor  indicates  which 
hypothesis  is  more  supported  by  the  data.  Figure  3  shows  the 
Bayes factor classification and the interpretation we adapted from 
[8].  The  default  priors  of  the  alternative  hypothesis  and  the 
calculation methods for different study design can be found in the 
work of Rouder and colleagues [29,30].

Since  we  had  prior  information  about  the  effect  of  the  two 
modes  on  users’  behavior,  we  choose  the  two-sided  alternative 
hypothesis (𝐻1) that the population mean of the difference is not 
equal  to  0.  Due  to  the  same  reason,  we  use  the  default  Cauchy 
distribution  (𝑟 = 1/√2)  as the  prior  when  we  estimate  the effect 
size.  Following  the  JASP  guidelines  [8],  we  also  report  the 
median (M) and the 95% credible interval (CI) of the effect size.

robustness.  For  the  one  with  a  deviation  from  normality,  we

pairs rank biserial correlation (r) [21] to show the effect size.

0.563). The Bayes factor provides no evidence for both H0 and H1 
(BF10 = 0.993, M = 0.455, CI = [-0.137, 1.110]). However, in the 
boxplot of the within-subject difference (Figure 4), we see a trend 
that the macro-movements of the tag-along mode are less than the 
spatial-mapping mode. 

As  macro-movements  include  sit-stand  transitions  and  the 
movements  of  changing  body  direction/position,  we  decompose 
them  into  two  categories  for  a  deeper  understanding  (see  Figure 
5).  The  comparison  of  sit-stand transitions  shows  weak evidence 
for H0 (BF10 = 0.453, M = -0.243, CI = [-0.841, 0.310], p = 0.359, 
Cohen’s  d  =  -0.306),  while the  result  of  body  direction/position 
changes indicates moderate evidence in favor of H1 (BF10 = 3.324, 
M = 0.704, CI = [0.057, 1.488], p = 0.022, Cohen’s d = 0.874). 
Therefore,  the  participants  changed  their  body  direction/position 
when sitting or standing  more often in the spatial-mapping mode 
than the tag-along mode.  However, sit-stand transitions tended to 
be  the  same.  This  grouping  analysis  explains  the  comparison 
result of the total macro-movements: the sit-stand transitions data 
(weakly  supporting  H0)  compensates  the  moderate  evidence  for 
H1 from  the  body  direction/position  changes  data,  resulting  in  no 
evidence for both H0 and H1 for the whole macro-movements. 

Besides  the  number  of  sit-stand  transitions,  the  duration  of 
sitting/standing  is  also  of  interest.  Because  the  data  of  standing 
duration  violate  the  normality  assumption,  we  use  a  Wilcoxon 
signed-rank  test  to  compare  the  two  modes.  The  result  does  not 
suggest  a  significant  effect  (p  =  0.183,  r  =  -0.709).  However, 
from the boxplot (Figure 6) of the within-subject difference of the 
standing duration, we see most of the difference is positive except 
one outlier. In other words, all the participants but one stood more 
in the tag-along mode than the spatial-mapping mode.

direction/position changes in the spatial-mapping (SM) mode,

 Micro-Movements 

5.2 
Regarding  the  micro-movements,  we  investigate  two  categories: 
the  movements  of  adjusting  HoloLens  (AH)  and  the  rest  head 
movements (see Figure  7). The  AH  involves  several  movements 
with  hands  and  the  head  -  caused  by  the  discomfort  of  wearing 
HoloLens  –  showing  weak  evidence  for  H1  (BF10 =  1.660,  M  = 
0.560, CI = [-0.044, 1.252], p = 0.054, Cohen’s d = 0.700). The 
rest  head  movements  indicate  strong  evidence  in  favor  of  H1 
(BF10 =  10.900,  M  =  -0.980,  CI  =  [-1.816,  -0.154],  p  =  0.005, 
Cohen’s d = -1.168) with the other direction. In other words, the 
participants  moved  their  heads  much  more  frequently  in  the 
spatial-mapping  mode  than  the  tag-along  modes,  excluding  the 
movements  caused  by  adjusting  HoloLens.  Therefore, 
the 
comparison  of  head-related  micro-movements  shows  different 
trends between the two modes to the overall micro-movements. 

Figure 7: The boxplot of the numbers of adjusting HoloLens 
and head movements in the spatial-mapping (SM) mode, the 
tag-along (TA) mode, and the within-subject difference (TA-S

M). 

 Head Direction 

5.3 
Besides movements, using right postures when sitting or standing 
is  also  critical 
to  prevent  musculoskeletal  disorders  [14], 
especially  the  ones  caused  by  new  technologies  (e.g.,  the  “text 
neck” [5]). The pitch angle of the head corresponds to the pressure 
on  the  cervical  vertebrae  of  the  spine.  The  logged  data  of  the 
HoloLens  postures  using the built-in  sensors  allow  us to  analyze 
the pitch angle of the participants quantitatively. We only include 
seven  participants’  data  because  three  participants’  data  of  the 
HoloLens posture were not complete due to technical issues. The 
Bayes  factor  shows  very  weak  evidence  in  favor  of  H1  (BF10  = 
1.092, M = -0.527, CI = [-1.335, 0.163], p = 0.114, Cohen’s d = -
0.698).  However,  the  box  plot  (Figure  8)  shows  a  trend  that  the 
pitch angles in the tag-along mode are 6.2 degrees higher than the 
spatial-mapping  mode  on  average.  After  checking  each 
participant’s  data,  we  found  that the  difference is  mainly  caused 
by  the  big  changes  of  two  participants  (#5  and  #6  in  Figure  9). 
The  medians  of  the pitch  angle are  12.6  and  14.2  degrees  in the 
two  modes,  which  are  very  close  to  each  other.  It  should  be 
noticed  that  the  participants  changed  their  head  pitch  angles 
several  times  during  the  study  (see  Figure  7).  However,  the 
average values indicate that the participants spent more time using 
the head-up postures.

and head movements in the spatial-mapping (SM) mode, the 
tag-along (TA) mode, and the within-subject difference (TA-
SM). 

Figure 9: The bar chart of the pitch angle of HoloLens during 
the study in the spatial-mapping (SM) mode, and the tag-
along (TA) mode. The data from participants #5 and #6 
contribute to the most difference on average. 

 Workload 

5.4 
The  Bayes  factors  of  the  workload  assessment  between  the  two 
modes show weak to moderate evidence in favor of H0 (see Figure 
10  and  Table  2).  This  result  indicates  that  the  participants  were 
under  a  similar  workload  during  the  two  modes,  as  expected. 
Besides,  the  scores  of  the  mental  demand  and  the  effort  suggest 
that our task caused a moderate workload to the participants.

 Discussion 

 Explanations of Movements 

6.1 
The  statistical  result  of 
the  macro-movements  comparison 
between the two modes  moderately supports that the participants 
performed  more  movements  of  changing  body  position/direction 
in the spatial-mapping mode. The interview in our study provides 
us some hints to explain this result: when asked about the factors 
affecting them choosing postures and adjusting the virtual screen, 
the  common  answer  of  the  participants  was  the  physical  and 
visual comfort. Because they could find a comfortable posture to 
do  the  task  easier  in  the  tag-along  mode,  they  performed  fewer 
movements to adjust their body positions/directions.  

Regarding  the  sit-stand  transitions,  we  see  weak  evidence  in 
favor  of  the  null  hypothesis:  no  difference  between  the  two 
modes.  Based  on  the  interview,  we  find  that  the  reasons  behind 
macro-movements  are  multifaceted.  Here  we 
the 
mentioned factors affecting the participants’ macro-movements: 

list  all 

1.  The musculoskeletal tiredness/discomfort.  

“If getting tired when standing, I will sit down. When feeling 
uncomfortable using sitting postures, I stand up.” 

2.  The visual tiredness/discomfort.  

“I  changed  between  sitting  and  standing  to  find  a  good 
posture to optimize visual comfort.” 

3.  The weight of HoloLens.  

“Sometimes  I  have  to  sit  down  and  use  my  hand  to  hold 
HoloLens for reducing the weight on my head.” 

4.  Self-reminding of health.  

“I stood up because I thought it’s unhealthy to sit for a long 
time, but not I was uncomfortable when I sat there.” 

5.  Unconsciousness/habits.  

“I think I just sat down after standing for a while because of 
my habit of sitting.” 

The  head  movements  excluding 

the  ones  of  adjusting 
HoloLens in the tag-along mode were significantly more than the 
spatial-mapping mode with strong evidence. This result indicates 
that simplicity and freedom encourage head movements. We also 
found  the  reason  from  the  interview:  the  participants  needed  to 
adjust postures to reduce the discomfort of wearing HoloLens and 
some static postures during the task; the tag-along mode provided 
an easier way to do so. 

1.  The higher degree  of  simplicity  and  freedom  of  moving  the 
virtual screen leads to more  head movements. However, the 
effect  on  macro-movements  is  complex.  Weak  evidence 
supports  no  effect  on  sit-stand  transitions,  while  moderate 
evidence  shows  that  the  higher  degree  of  simplicity  and 
freedom  lead  to  fewer  movements  of  changing  body 
position/direction.  

2.  The main factor affecting the participants’ movements during 
our task is the body discomfort including the musculoskeletal 
and  the  visual  discomfort.  The  body  discomfort  might  be 
caused  by  wearing  HoloLens  and  the  participants’  static 
postures. Some participants could remind themselves to stand 
up after sitting for health, but only occasionally. 

Therefore,  three  factors  are  related  to  the  participants’ 
movements  during  the  study:  the  physical  and  visual  discomfort 
of  using  HoloLens,  the  simplicity  and  freedom  of  moving  the 
virtual  screen,  and  the  participants’  ability  to  remind  themselves 
to move. Comparing to the traditional computer screen, HoloLens 
provides  more  movement and  posture  freedom,  but  less  physical 
and visual comfort for screen-based tasks.  

6.2 

 Reminders 

The participants’ sit-stand transitions were around three times 
during the one-hour study session  on average in both modes (see 
Figure  5),  while  the  standing  duration  accounted  for  20-30%  of 
the  one-hour  session  on  average  (see  Figure  6).  These  numbers 
seem  to  indicate  a  healthy  combination  of  sitting  and  standing 
durations.  However,  some  participants  still  sat  for  a  long  time 
without  moving.  There  were two  participants  even sitting  all the 
time during the study (see Figure 11).  

The  score  of  the  self-report  habit  strength  index  (5.47±0.65 
out of 7) indicates that all the participants had moderate-to-strong 
sedentary  habit  strength.  Figure  11  shows  that  the  participants 
with sedentary work styles could still be sedentary even given the 
freedom  of  moving  the  virtual  screen.  Therefore,  reminders  for 
prolonged  sitting  are also  necessary  when  using  AR-HMDs, just 
as the case when using computer screens. 

Figure 11: Each row represents a one-hour study session. The 
green part refers to standing; the red part refers to sitting; the 
white part means the participant stopped because of eye 
fatigue.

F. Surname et al. 

Besides  the  sitting  duration,  we  also  observed  several  bad 
postures  when  the  participants  wore  HoloLens.  The  postures, 
which  cause  an  increase  of  intradiscal  pressure,  might  lead  to  a 
higher  risk  of  musculoskeletal  disorders  over  time  [14].  Besides 
some bad postures we can usually see (e.g., slouching in the chair 
and  crossing  legs  while  sitting),  we  also  observed  some 
potentially harmful  postures (see Figure 12) that we could hardly 
use  with  the  traditional  screen  on  the  table.  Therefore,  posture 
monitoring  and  reminding  are  necessary,  as  we  discussed  in  the 
section of related work. It could improve the existing  AR-HMDs 
for health promotion by adding these features. 

Figure 12: Selected bad postures of the participants during 
our study. 

All  the  participants  agreed  that  a  reminder  would  be  helpful 
because they could easily forget to stand up and use bad postures 
when  focusing  on  the  task.  Furthermore,  three  participants 
mentioned  a  prompt  reminder  might  not  work  for  them.  They 
preferred  alternative  reminders  to  force  them  to  change  postures 
and  move  more,  e.g.,  making  the  virtual  screen  tilt  or  blur  to 
indicate bad postures and prolonged sitting. 

 Limitations and Future Work 

6.3 
This  is  an  initial  work  to  explore  the  potential  impact  of  AR-
HMDs  on  the  movement  behavior  of  office  workers.  There  are 
several  limitations  to  this  work,  which  could  also  be  research 
opportunities  for  future  work. First, the  user task  in this  study  is 
simplistic. Real office work might involve more sophisticated user 
interaction,  which  should  be  considered  in  future  work,  e.g., 
browsing webpages or navigating maps.  

Second,  the  wearing  comfort  of  HoloLens  might  limit  the 
generalization  of  this  work.  Due  to  the  disadvantages  of  weight 
and the display quality (field of view and resolution) in HoloLens, 
all  participants  felt  uncomfortable  after  each  one-hour  study 
session.  Future  work  could  use  other  AR-HMDs  with  a  higher 
degree of wearing comfort. Furthermore, using other AR systems 
(e.g.,  RoomAlive  [19])  to  study  users’  movement  behavior 
avoiding the effect of discomfort of wearing HMDs also deserves 
future studies. 

Third, we only designed one virtual screen in our study, which 
did  not  make  full  use  of  the  spatial-awareness  feature  of 
HoloLens.  It  would  be  interesting  to  study  the  impact  of  multi-
screen on users’ movements. 

Lastly,  the  sample  size  is  relatively  small.  Despite  the 
moderate  to  strong  evidence  in  the  Bayesian  analysis,  some 
evidence  is  very  weak,  e.g.,  the  sit-stand  transitions  and  the 
HoloLens pitch angle. The weak evidence  might be improved by 
using larger sample size.

 Conclusion 

7 
Through  the  exploratory  study,  we  have  several  interesting 
body 
findings: 
direction/position  changes  were  more  in  the  spatial-mapping 
mode  than  the  tag-along  mode;  (2)  weak  evidence  supports  that 
sit-stand  transitions  and  standing  durations  had  no  difference 
between  the  two  modes;  (3)  the  participants  adjusted  HoloLens 
more times in the spatial-mapping mode with weak evidence; (4) 
the  participants  moved  the  head  more  times  (excluding  the  ones 
related to adjusting HoloLens) in the tag-along mode with strong 
evidence. The simplicity and freedom of moving the virtual screen 
encouraged movement behavior, while the discomfort of wearing 
HoloLens  could  also  make  users  move  to  adjust  it.  All  the 
participants preferred the tag-along mode because they felt it more 
comfortable, but we also observed  bad postures as the side effect 
of the high simplicity and freedom of moving the virtual screen. 

To sum up, this work made the following contributions to the 
research field of multimedia and human-computer interaction: (1) 
it  is  the  first  work  to  investigate  the  potential  impact  of  the 
augmented-reality  head-mounted  display  (AR-HMD)  on  users’ 
movement  behavior  in  screen-based  office  work;  (2) inspired  by 
related  work,  we  analyzed  the  movement  behavior  through  the 
lenses  of  macro-movements  and  micro-movements  with 
categorizing the movements to sub-groups; (3) we used Bayesian 
method,  in  addition  to  the  null-hypothesis  significant  test,  to 
analyze  and  report  the  study  results;  (4)  the  study  results 
confirmed  the  effect  of  the  freedom  and  simplicity  (EoFS)  of 
moving  the  virtual  screen  in  HoloLens  on  users’  movement 
behavior; (5) besides EoFS, we also  found that the discomfort of 
using HoloLens could partially  cause users’ movement behavior; 
(6)  based  on  the  findings  and  the  limitations  of  this  work,  we 
provide four research opportunities for future work. 

Through this study, we want to show the necessity of studying 
the  ergonomics  of  AR-HMDs,  especially  their  impact  on  users’ 
movement behavior. Besides the exciting user experience brought 
by  the  new  technology,  we  should  also  consider  the  health 
perspectives when designing applications using AR-HMDs.
