Abstract. The location of the neutron drip line, currently known for only the lightest elements, remains
a fundamental question in nuclear physics. Its description is a challenge for microscopic nuclear energy
density functionals, as it must take into account in a realistic way not only the nuclear potential, but also
pairing correlations, deformation eﬀects and coupling to the continuum. The recently developed deformed
relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) aims to provide a uniﬁed description of
even-even nuclei throughout the nuclear chart. Here, the DRHBc with the successful density functional
PC-PK1 is used to investigate whether and how deformation inﬂuences the prediction for the neutron
drip-line location for even-even nuclei with 8 ≤ Z ≤ 20, where many isotopes are predicted deformed. The
results are compared with those based on the spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB)
theory and discussed in terms of shape evolution and the variational principle. It is found that the Ne and
Ar drip-line nuclei are diﬀerent after the deformation eﬀect is included. The direction of the change is not
necessarily towards an extended drip line, but rather depends on the evolution of the degree of deformation
towards the drip line. Deformation eﬀects as well as pairing and continuum eﬀects treated in a consistent
way can aﬀect critically the theoretical description of the neutron drip-line location.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nuclear masses are not only of great importance in nu-
clear physics but are also of interdisciplinary interest no-
tably for research on fundamental interactions and astro-
physics [1]. While ongoing experiments reach ever farther
away from the valley of stability, the neutron drip line has
only been mapped for the lightest elements and theory is
essential for providing qualitative and quantitative predic-
tions and extrapolations. The theoretical research on the
neutron drip line and associated exotic phenomena has
long been active [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. The neutron-rich
nuclei show diﬀerent structures and properties compared
to the stable nuclei: As the number of neutrons increases,
the shape and size of nuclei may change in ways not ob-
served in stable nuclei, leading to new phenomena like
giant haloes, soft and pygmy resonances, and new magic
numbers, in addition to neutron skin and new regions of
shape coexistence and isomerism [3,5,11, 12,13, 14,15, 16,
17,18, 19,20], with implications for astrophysical and nu-
cleosynthesis studies.

In unstable, weakly-bound nuclei close to the neutron
drip line, continuum and pairing correlations play an im-

portant role [2,3,4,14,21,22, 23, 24]. The neutron Fermi
energy is very close to the continuum, so in order to study
theoretically the neutron drip line, pairing correlations
and continuum eﬀects must be taken into account to de-
termine the neutron separation energy as precisely as pos-
sible. Both pairing correlations and the treatment of con-
tinuum eﬀects can inﬂuence the predictions for the drip
line.

The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) model has found
many applications in the study of nuclear masses and the
drip lines [25,26,27]. The relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov
approach (RHB) has been used in the study of haloes in
spherical nuclei [23,28,29]. Recently, the Relativistic Con-
tinuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory [23,29] was
used to construct a complete mass table and explore nu-
cleon drip-lines [30] by assuming spherical symmetry through-
out. The PC-PK1 relativistic energy density functional
was used, which has been shown to provide a good descrip-
tion of inﬁnite nuclear matter and ﬁnite nuclei, including
the isospin dependence of the binding energy along iso-
topic and isotonic chains [31]. The ground-state properties
of nuclei with proton number 8 to 120 were investigated.
With the eﬀects of the continuum included, there are to-
tally 9035 nuclei predicted to be bound. In that work,
it was found that the coupling between the bound states

and the continuum due to the pairing correlations plays
an essential role in extending the nuclear landscape.

Most known nuclei are deformed. In order to properly
describe deformed exotic nuclei, the deformed relativistic
Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) was
developed, initially based on the meson-exchange density
functional [32,33] and extended to the version with density-
dependent meson-nucleon couplings [34] and to include
the blocking eﬀect [35]. Continuum eﬀects are included
by solving the deformed RHB equations in a Dirac Woods-
Saxon basis [36]. Recently, the DRHBc with point-coupling
density functionals was developed [37]. The aim is to pro-
vide a uniﬁed description of even-even nuclei through-
out the nuclear chart by including all important eﬀects,
namely continuum, pairing, and deformation, presently re-
stricted to axial symmetry. The DRHBc theory in its var-
ious iterations has been applied in the study of exotic Mg
isotopes, predicting a decoupling between the core and
the halo in 42,44Mg [32,33], in resolving the puzzle con-
cerning the radius and conﬁguration of valence neutrons
in 22C [38], and a study of particles in the classically for-
bidden regions of Mg isotopes [39].

In the present investigation, we are interested in how
the inclusion of deformation degrees of freedom can aﬀect
the predictions for the drip line. The theoretical question
posed is whether the additional degrees of freedom rep-
resented by deformation and generally leading to more
binding can lead to a sizable extension of the nuclear land-
scape. To this aim, we compare new results obtained with
the DRHBc with the RCHB predictions of Ref. [30] and of
Ref. [40], which focuses on the region from Oxygen to Ti-
tanium. In both the DRHBc and the RCHB calculations,
the PC-PK1 functional is used. We focus on even-even nu-
clei in the nuclear-chart region from Oxygen to Calcium.

This paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 the DRHBc
formalism and numerical implementation are presented
brieﬂy. In Sec. 3 we present and discuss our results. First,
we examine how the deformation parameter evolves along
the isotopic chains. Second, we report how the drip-line
predictions change with respect to RCHB predictions, i.e.,
when we include deformation. Finally, we inspect the evo-
lution of separation energies towards the drip line in Ne,
Mg, and Ar isotopic chains in order to interpret and dis-
cuss the results. We conclude in Sec. 4.

(11)

For the description of nuclei close to the drip line it is im-
portant to include consistently both the continuum and
deformation eﬀects and the coupling among all these fea-
tures. A full treatment of the continuum by solving the
equations in coordinate space, as done in the spherical
case within the RCHB model [23,29], is not feasible at
present. Instead, in the deformed case the continuum is
taken into account by expanding the wavefunctions in the
Dirac Wood-Saxon (WS) basis [36]. The present numer-
ical implementation is therefore called DRHBc, standing
for Deformed Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in
continuum [33].

2.2 Numerical details

The numerical code for applying DRHBc and various tests,
including convergence tests with respect to the basis and
the Legendre expansion, are presented in Ref. [37]. Fol-
lowing those tests, for convergence of the DRHBc calcula-
tions, we use the angular momentum cutoﬀ Jmax = 23/2 (cid:126)
and the expansion order λmax = 6. The energy cutoﬀ
for the Dirac WS basis is taken as Ecut = 300 MeV. At

present we use the density functional PC-PK1 [31] for the
particle-hole channel. For the particle-particle channel, the
zero-range pairing force with saturation density ρsat =
0.152 fm−3 [30] and the strength V0 = −325 MeV fm3 is
used. Since we use a zero-range pairing force, we have to
introduce a pairing cutoﬀ over quasiparticle space. Here, a
sharp cutoﬀ is adopted with a pairing window of 100 MeV.
The pairing strength was determined so as to reproduce
experimental even-odd mass diﬀerences within the above-
deﬁned model space [37].

For each isotope, unconstrained calculations are per-
formed by using diﬀerent initialization conditions, in par-
ticular, diﬀerent initial deformation parameter values β =
−0.4, −0.2, . . . 0.6 for the initial potential. These calcula-
tions may or may not lead to the same solution, depending
on how many local minima exist in the isotope’s energy
landscape. In spherical cases (such as O and Ca isotopes)
typically all solutions converge to the spherical ground
state. In the case of more than one solution with very
similar energies the ground state can be conﬁrmed with
constrained calculations, whereby the target deformation
parameter is ﬁxed. In this way, the dependence of the en-
ergy on the deformation parameter and the absolute min-
imum value of the energy can be veriﬁed. The presence of
near-degenerate solutions is interesting in the context of
shape coexistence.

We note that in the spherical RCHB applications of
Ref. [30] the PC-PK1 density functional was used as well.
However, the pairing strength determined in the same way
was −342.5 MeV fm3, while the angular momentum cut-
oﬀ was set to 19/2 (cid:126). Thus comparisons between DRHBc
and RCHB results will reﬂect the deformation and pairing
eﬀects combined. In order to test overall consistency, we
veriﬁed that total binding energies of closed-shell nuclei
from DRHBc and those from RCHB are the same (within
tens of keV).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Deformation along isotopic chains

The main purpose of the present work is to investigate the
eﬀect of the deformation degree of freedom on the neu-
tron drip line location for even-even isotopes from O to
Ca. We begin by inspecting the evolution of deformation
along the isotopic chains for N ≥ Z. The O and Ca iso-
topes are predicted spherical by DRHBc and therefore no
changes are expected with respect to RCHB predictions.
The quadrupole deformation parameters for the Ne, Mg,
Si, S, and Ar isotopic chains are shown in Fig. 1 up to one
isotope beyond the predicted drip-line nucleus. Many iso-
topes, including very neutron-rich ones, are predicted de-
formed. The proton and neutron deformation parameters
(β2,p and β2,n) are similar to each other (though not equal)
in all the cases shown here, and we show the weighted av-
erage deformation parameter given by β2 = (Z/A)β2,p +
(N/A)β2,n. All the experimental data are taken from the
NNDC [44].

that the experimental β2 values of intrinsically spherical
nuclei are not necessarily zero.

10Ne14 or 48

In some cases the deformation parameter seems to os-
cillate at random between neighboring isotopes, for exam-
ple, around 24
16S32. It is because we show only the
deformation parameter of the very lowest-energy solution
in each case. However, the 8 < Z < 20 region examined
here includes several candidates for shape coexistence or
softness against deformation, which is borne out of our cal-
culations. We ﬁnd several isotopes with near-degenerate
local energy minima (with energy diﬀerence of up to a few
hundred keV) for diﬀerent deformation parameters. (We
stress that there is no ambiguity for the predicted location
of the drip line as a result.) We show in Fig. 2 the energies
of some representative isotopes as a function of deforma-
tion parameter, obtained by constrained DRHBc calcula-
tions. For example, although 32
14Si18 is indicated as oblately
deformed in Fig. 1(c), it is revealed that the energy of the
spherically symmetric solution is within about 300 keV
from the oblate solution. The energies of the local minima
near β2 = ±0.1 for 62
18Ar44 diﬀer by less than 100 keV.
The examples shown in Fig. 2 include very neutron-rich
Ar isotopes for the discussion in Sec. 3.3.

3.2 Location of the drip line

The theoretical prediction for the location of the neutron
drip line is determined by inspecting both the two neutron
separation energy S2n and the neutron Fermi energy λn.
The former is deﬁned as follows,

S2n(Z, N ) = B(Z, N ) − B(Z, N − 2),

(12)

where B(Z, N ) = −E(Z, N ) is the binding energy of the
nucleus with atomic number Z and neutron number N .
When the two neutron separation energy is found positive
and the neutron Fermi energy is found negative, the nu-
cleus is classiﬁed as bound. The last bound isotope found
along an isotopic chain deﬁnes the location of the neutron
drip line. The heaviest even isotopes of the O–Ca elements
discovered so far are 26

In Ref. [30] it was shown that the coupling of bound
states with continuum states due to pairing correlations
can extend considerably the theoretically predicted nu-
clear landscape. In Ref. [40], which focused on the region
from Oxygen to Titanium, RCHB results were compared
with those of various mass models with no explicit treat-
ment of the continuum. It was concluded that including a
proper description of the continuum can extend the neu-
tron drip line by several isotopes for each element.

data are taken from the NNDC [44]. Filled circles denote the
ﬁrst isotope beyond the drip line.

We note that only the absolute value, not the sign,
of the deformation parameter is determined experimen-
tally. In addition, the deﬁnitions of the experimental and
the calculated parameters are diﬀerent: The experimental
β2 parameter is determined from the electric quadrupole
excitation spectrum while the theoretical one quantiﬁes
the degree of the intrinsic deformation of the mean ﬁeld.
Therefore, the values do not necessarily agree [45]. Note

Here we explore the deformation eﬀects on the neu-
tron drip line location by comparing the results from the
DRHBc theory with those from the RCHB theory [30].
The predicted location of the drip line will of course de-
pend on the density functional parameterization used (here,
PC-PK1). In this work, we are mainly interested in pos-
sible deformation eﬀects on the neutron drip lines in a
relative sense.

work by the DRHBc theory (with deformation) in comparison

even isotopes with 8 ≤ Z ≤ 20. The arrows show the direction
of the changes with the inclusion of deformation. The neutron
numbers at the drip line are tabulated below the ﬁgure.

trary, nuclei in the vicinity of the drip line are predicted
deformed for Ne, Mg, and Ar.

It is especially interesting that, while the Ar isotopic
chain is extended to higher N when deformation is in-
cluded, augmenting the continuum eﬀects, the neutron
drip line shrinks in the case of Ne isotopes. There is no
change in Mg due to the inclusion of deformation. We
therefore proceed to inspect these isotopes in more detail.

3.3 Evolution of separation energies: Ne, Mg, and Ar

For Ne, Mg, and Ar isotopes we inspect the quantities S2n
and λn which deﬁne the location of the drip line. Figure 4
(a) shows two neutron separation energy (S2n) of Ne iso-
topes with respect to the neutron number. In the RCHB
calculations (green lines), two neutron separation energies
(S2n) remain positive until the neutron number 32. How-
ever, the value of S2n from the DRHBc calculations (red
lines) remain positive up to the neutron number 28. Fig-
ure 4 (b) shows neutron Fermi energies (λn) of Ne isotopes
and they stay negative up to the neutron number 32 in the
RCHB calculation. However, they stay negative up to 30
in the DRHBc calculations. Therefore, the neutron drip-
line location of Ne isotopes is predicted to be 38Ne instead
of 42Ne.

Figure 5 shows the same quantities for Mg isotopes.
There are sizable diﬀerences in the predictions towards

The results are summarized and visualized in Fig. 3.
In all the cases the predicted drip line lies beyond the iso-
topes experimentally discovered so far. The drip-line lo-
cations are not aﬀected with the inclusion of deformation,
except for the Ne and Ar isotopic chains. As expected, the
drip O and Ca isotopes are predicted the same in both
cases, because all those isotopes are predicted spherical.
We also ﬁnd that the last two or three bound S and Si
isotopes are predicted spherical (see Fig. 1). On the con-

the drip line but not for the drip nucleus, N = 34. In
addition, the next isotope, unbound with N = 36, is pre-
dicted spherical. Therefore, the situation turns out to be
similar to the Si, S cases.

Figure 6 shows the same quantities for Ar isotopes. In
the RCHB calculations S2n remains positive until the neu-
tron number becomes 44, while in the DRHBc calculations
S2n is positive until the neutron number 52. Similarly,
λn values of Ar isotopes stay negative up to the neutron
number 46 in the RCHB calculations and up to 52 in the
DRHBc calculations. Therefore, the neutron drip-line lo-
cation of Ar isotopes is predicted to be 70Ar instead of
62Ar.

For both Ne and Ar the diﬀerences between the two
models appear marginal at large N , but they are suﬃ-
cient to shift the drip-line location. Furthermore, the dif-
ferences in the proximity of the drip line have opposite
signs for Ne and Ar leading to the shrinking of the drip
line in the former case when deformation is taken into ac-
count and to extension in the latter. The question arises as
to whether such results are consistent with the generally
stronger binding expected from the DRHBc calculations.
Indeed, when deformation is included in the calcula-
tions, but everything else (interaction, cut-oﬀ parameters,
etc.) kept the same as in the calculations in spherical sym-
metry and if a deformed solution is found to be the ground
state, the deformed state must be more bound than the

cluding more degrees of freedom (deformation) we expect
equal or lower energies by virtue of the variational prin-
ciple. Then generally the DRHBc calculations should give
more (or equally) bound solutions than the RCHB calcu-
lations. (Exceptions may still occur, especially for near-
spherical nuclei, owing to the diﬀerent numerical imple-
mentations and diﬀerent pairing parameters used in the
two types of calculations.) As s result, an extension of
the drip line might be expected rather than a shrinking.
On the other hand, it is not the value of the binding en-
ergy that matters, but the diﬀerence between the binding
energies of neighboring isotopes. The diﬀerence between
the two-neutron separation energy predicted by DRHBc,
S2n(DRHBc), and that predicted by the spherical model
RCHB, S2n(RCHB), is given by

∆S2n ≡ S2n(DRHBc) − S2n(RCHB)
= ∆B(Z, N ) − ∆B(Z, N − 2),

(13)

where we have denoted by ∆B = B(DRHBc)−B(RCHB)
the diﬀerence in the binding energies of each model. Even
though both ∆B(Z, N ) and ∆B(Z, N − 2) are expected
to be positive, the diﬀerence ∆S2n can be either positive
or negative. If ∆B(Z, N ) is smaller than ∆B(Z, N − 2),
then the drip line may shift to lower N . Let us therefore
investigate ∆B and ∆S2n.

The diﬀerence in binding and separation energies for
the three isotopic chains Ne, Mg, and Ar is shown in
Fig. 7. As expected from Eq. (13) ∆S resembles a diﬀer-
ential of ∆B: an increase (decrease) of ∆B with N leads
to a positive (negative) value for ∆S. For Ar, the sep-
aration energy diﬀerence increases towards the drip line.
Thus, for example, ∆B(Z = 18, N = 46) is larger than
∆B(Z = 18, N = 44). The increase in the gain of bind-
ing owing to deformation is consistent with the increase
in the (absolute value of the) deformation parameter. (See
Fig. 1(e).) The evolution of the Ar energy landscape to-
wards and beyond the neutron drip line is also exempliﬁed
by Fig. 2(c),(d), and (e). 62Ar represents a transitional
situation between the spherical 58,60Ar isotopes and the
heavier oblate isotopes, whose absolute deformation para-
mater increases with N until N becomes equal to 52 and
the drip line is reached. Such a trend can lead to an ex-
tension of the drip line. On the contrary, for Ne the trend
of the separation energy diﬀerence is to drop towards the
drip line. Thus ∆B(Z = 10, N = 28) is smaller than
∆B(Z = 10, N = 26). The drop in the gain in binding
owing to deformation is consistent with the decrease in
the deformation parameter. (See Fig. 1(a).) Such a trend
can lead to the shrinking of the drip line. As obvious from
the Mg case, the above are not suﬃcient conditions for
the respective results to occur. However, the condition
∆S2n < 0 seems necessary for the shrinking of the drip
line.

At this point a few comments are necessary on what
appear to be possible violations of the variational princi-
ple. Fig. 7(a) shows that ∆B becomes negative for some
neutron numbers, in which case the DRHBc solutions are
less bound than the RCHB ones. First, as already men-

Fig. 7. The diﬀerences ∆B and ∆S2n between results of
the DRHBc calculations (with V0 = −325 MeV fm3) and the
RCHB calculations (with V0 = −342.5 MeV fm3).

tioned, some minor numerical discrepancies are expected
from the model space cut-oﬀ parameters whose optimal
values diﬀer for each of the numerical implementations
and are related to the WS basis treatment of continuum
states. More importantly, the optimal pairing parameter
for DRHBc is found weaker than in RCHB leading to less
binding coming from pairing correlations. In order to in-
vestigate this eﬀect, we have performed the same calcula-
tions and comparisons by using the same pairing strength
as in RCHB, V0 = −342.5 MeV fm3. We found that the
general trends for ∆B, ∆S2n do not change. The main
diﬀerence is a small positive shift for ∆B, leading to bet-
ter compliance with the variational principle.

4 Conclusions

Even-even neutron-rich isotopes from O to Ca were in-
vestigated by using the DRHBc theory with the PC-PK1
functional. The neutron drip-line location was determined
by calculating the two-neutron separation energies and
the neutron Fermi energies. In order to investigate the
deformation eﬀect, on the neutron drip-line location, we
compared the present results with those predicted by the
RCHB theory with spherical symmetry. We found that the
Ne and Ar drip line nuclei are diﬀerent when the deforma-
tion eﬀect is included. The direction of the change in the
neutron drip line is not necessarily towards an extended
drip line. It rather appears dependent upon the evolution
of the degree of deformation (magnitude of the deforma-

tion parameter) towards the drip line: When the drip line
nuclei are predicted spherical, the drip line doesn’t change;
for Ne the deformation decreases towards the drip line and
the drip line “shrinks”; the opposite is seen for Ar. We con-
clude that taking into account deformation eﬀects as well
as pairing and continuum eﬀects in a consistent way can
aﬀect critically the theoretical description of the neutron
drip-line location.

It would be interesting to see if similar trends are ob-
served in diﬀerent regions of the nuclear chart. Also shape
coexistence and isomerism remain important topics for fu-
ture work. Several investigations are currently in progress
within the broader DRHBc mass table collaboration [37,
38,39,55].
