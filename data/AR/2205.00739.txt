Abstract 

Investigation  of  the  magnetic  switching  and  magnetoresistive  behaviour  of  nanoscale 

spin valve elements of different sizes, shapes and arrays is of vital importance for their 

application  in  future  magnetic  memory  and  storage  devices.  To  this  end,  we  have 

inspected  the  magnetic  switching  mechanism  and  magnetoresistive  behaviour  of 

nanoscale  spin  valve  (Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20)  elements  of  two  different  shapes  with  varying 

lateral aspect ratios (ARs) by computational micromagnetic simulation. Further, we have 

inspected the same for 2x2 and 3x3 arrays of the elliptical  elements with AR = 1.25 of 

varying interelement spacing. We have analysed how the shape of the hysteresis loop and 

its various parameters such as the coercive field, remanence, saturation field were altered 

by the variation in magnetic field. The magnetization reversal states were simulated to 

explore the spatial coherence of magnetization switching. We observe that the elements 

with higher AR show the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers forming antiparallel states in the plateau 

similar to synthetic antiferromagnets. As we reduce the AR, more complex quasi-uniform 

magnetic states are observed which are even more complicated for elliptical  elements. 

The  elliptical  elements  with  the  aspect  ratio  of  1.25  shows  coherent  and  predictable 

switching  behaviour,  showing  its  suitability  for  the  application  in  magnetic  memory 

elements. We observe a gradual increase in magnetoresistance (MR%) with the increase 

in AR of the spin valve elements, and the decrease in interelement spacing between the 

spin valve elements in their arrays. The magnetic flux density decreases, as we increase 

the cell spacing between the elements. The magnetic hysteresis loops, magnetoresistance 

and  spatial  coherence  of  magnetic  switching  give  a  guiding  principle  for  selection  of 

geometric  parameters  of  nanoscale  spin  valve  arrays  towards  their  application  in 

magnetic memory devices.

I. Introduction: 

Charge-based  electronics  are  based  on  transistors.  Hence,  they  are  facing  problems  in 

scalability  and  thermal  runaway  problems.  In  present  microelectronic  devices  the 

commonly used memories are static RAM (SRAM) [1-2], dynamic RAM (DRAM) [3-4] and 

flash memory [5]. These are all capacitive technologies which store  memory in charge 

states.  As  times  have  progressed,  these  memory  devices  have  been  scaled  down 

efficiently  to  reach  higher  speeds  and  increased  density  of  memory  chips  in  a  cost-

effective way [6]. However, charge based storage devices are reaching the physical limits 

of  scalability.  The  emergence  of  zero  capacitance  memory  (ZRAM)  [7],  advanced  RAM 

(ARAM), zero impact ionization memory (Z2RAM) have provided impetus in the charge-

based memory devices. However, designing and developing universal memory is the next 

step in the progression of memory. Future universal memory [8] is expected to combine 

the  high  density  of DRAM, non-volatility  of  flash  memory  and  high  speed  of SRAM. 

Therefore,  development  of  new  concepts  of  memories  based  on  a  different  storage 

principle will be important. 

As a replacement for charge-based RAM, resistive memories such as resistive random-

access memory (RRAM) [9], phase change memory [10] and magnetoresistive random-

access  memory  (MRAM)  [11]  hold  a  lot  of  promise.  MRAM  is  one  of  the  early  success 

stories in the field of magnetoelectronics, also known as spintronics, which employs the 

electron's spin degree of freedom in addition to its charge degree of freedom [12]. Unlike 

charge-based  RAM,  data  in  MRAM  is  processed  using  magnetic  elements  rather  than 

electric charge or current. The elements are made up of two ferromagnetic thin layers 

separated by a thin insulating layer, each of which may have a magnetization. To store 

memory,  the  magnetic  state  of  one  of  those  two  ferromagnetic  layers  is  fixed  in  one 

direction  (reference  layer:  RL),  while  the  magnetization  of  the  other  layer  is  free  to 

change (free layer: FL). The FL can switch between two magnetic states, parallel and anti-

parallel to the RL's fixed magnetization direction. The antiparallel and parallel states have 

different magnetoresistance values, which are mapped to the binary memory states ‘0' 

and ‘1'. This device is referred to as a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) [13], and it is the 

most  basic  unit  for  an  MRAM  bit.  A  memory  device  is  made  up  of  a  network  of  these 

memory cells. 

2 

 
The giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effects are the 

two  most  common  magnetoresistance  phenomena.  Julliere  discovered  TMR  in  a 

Fe/Ge/Co junction at low temperature (T 4.2K) in 1975 [14]. It was discovered in an MTJ, 

a  pillar made  up  of two ferromagnetic layers  separated by a  thin insulating layer. The 

pillar's resistance is determined by the magnetization orientation of the layers in relation 

to one another and is expressed as: 

𝑇𝑀𝑅 =  

𝑅𝐴𝑃−𝑅𝑃
𝑅𝑃

[1] 

where,  RAP  and  RP  correspond  to  the  resistance  in  antiparallel  (high  resistance)  and 

parallel (low resistance) magnetic states. The following can be deduced from this. If free 

states  with  the  same  spin  orientation  are  visible,  electrons  with  a  particular  spin 

orientation (‘spin-up' or ‘spin-down') can tunnel from one ferromagnetic layer to another 

through a non-conducting thin insulating barrier layer. The majority spin ('spin-up') and 

minority spin ('spin-down') electrons will easily tunnel through the barrier to the other 

ferromagnetic layer, filling the majority ('up') and minority ('down') states, resulting in a 

low resistive state in the parallel state. The majority spin (‘spin-down') and minority spin 

(‘spin-up')  electrons  from  the  first  ferromagnetic  layer,  on  the  other  hand,  will  fill  the 

minority  (‘down')  and  majority  (‘up')  states  in  the  second  ferromagnetic  layer, 

respectively, resulting in a low conductance, i.e. a high resistive state, in the antiparallel 

state.  GMR  occurs  in  a  standard  spin  valve  device,  which  consists  of  two  thin 

ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin metallic spacer. The magnetoresistance (MR) is 

caused by spin-dependent electron scattering at the interface, which is influenced by the 

parallel and antiparallel magnetic states of the two ferromagnetic layers. 

As a result, the magnetic switching behaviour of the magnetic layers in MRAM is critical. 

Data  writing  and  reading  in  traditional  MRAM  with  cross-wire  architecture  is 

accomplished by sending electrical current through the wires (write and read lines), with 

the  Oersted  magnetic  field  produced  by  the  current  achieving  magnetic  switching  or 

reversal of the layers. With the miniaturisation of MRAM cells, the necessary switching 

field and current become extremely high, resulting in energy loss due to Joule heating and 

a subsequent thermal runaway problem. After that, a new technology called spin transfer 

torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) was discovered to solve the problem [15]. A spin-polarized 

current is used to switch the electrons' magnetization [16-17]. This effect occurs in an 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
MTJ or a spin-valve, and STT tunnel junctions are used in STT-MRAM systems (STT-MTJ). 

As a result, Everspin has begun manufacturing 1GB STT-MRAM chips, which IBM will use 

in its next-generation FlashCore modules [18]. 

Here,  computational  micromagnetic  simulation  was  used  to  investigate  the  magnetic 

switching and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale spin valve elements in the form 

of Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20(permalloy, Py hereafter). The spin valve components were modelled 

in  two  different  shapes,  rectangular  and  elliptical,  with  the  lateral  aspect  ratio 

(eccentricity) of the cells varied. After that, we looked at elliptical element arrays. With 

shifts  in  the  aspect  ratio  for  both  the  shapes  and  the  cell  spacing  for  the  arrays  of 

components,  a  drastic  shift  in  magnetic  hysteresis  loops  (magnetization  vs.  applied 

magnetic field),  saturation  field, coercive  field, remanence, and switching behaviour is 

observed. To better understand the observed behaviour, we simulated the magnetization 

reversal states. 

II. Methods: 

The LLG micromagnetic simulator [19] was used to simulate magnetic hysteresis loops 

(magnetization  (M)  vs. external  magnetic  field  (H)).  The  Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert  (LLG) 

equation [20] given below governs the magnetization dynamics in this case. 

[2] 

Here,  the  first  term  represents  the  magnetization  precession  torque  under  the 

application of a magnetic field (H) while the second term represents the damping torque. 

γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, M is the magnetization vector and Heff is the effective magnetic 

field consisting of various terms as given below. 

Heff = H + Hex + Hd + HK 

[3] 

The exchange interaction field is  Hex, the demagnetizing field is  Hd, and the anisotropy 

field is HK. The exchange energies of both the Py and the Co layers are included in Hex in 

the  Co/Cu/Py  trilayer  portion.  Hd  takes  into  account  the  demagnetizing  fields  of  both 

magnetic  layers,  and  it  is  affected  by  the  length-scale,  shape,  and  aspect  ratio  of  the 

components. It is expected to change when we change the above-mentioned parameters 

in our simulation. The magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the two layers makes up HK. Ms 

is the saturation magnetization, and α is the dimensionless damping coefficient. The LLG

equation is solved using the finite difference method in the simulation. The geometry of 

the investigated spin-valve elements is divided into cuboidal cells with dimensions of 10 

nm x 10 nm x 10 nm. The software's graphical user interface (GUI) is used to describe the 

element  geometry,  dimensions,  number  of  layers,  and  properties.  Two  sample  shapes, 

rectangular  and  elliptical,  were  used  in  these  simulations,  with  the  length  (L)  of  the 

components varied as 250, 200, 150, 125, 100, and 50 nm and the width set at 100 nm. 

Consequently,  the  lateral  aspect  ratio  (AR)  varies  as  2.5,  2.0,  1.5,  1.25,  1.0  and  0.5.  In 

addition,  we  simulated  2x2  and  3x3  elliptical  element  arrays  with  AR  =  1.25.  The  cell 

spacing was chosen as 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 nm. Each layer's thickness is set to 

10 nm. Table 1 lists the material parameters that were used in the simulation. Each layer's 

exchange  constant  is  Aex,  the  uniaxial  magnetic  anisotropy  constant  is  Ku2,  and  the 

interlayer  exchange  is  Aij,  which  was  set  as  zero,  in  order  to  understand  the  reversal 

mechanism originated from purely dipolar interactions between the layers.

LLG equation is an ordinary differential equation which is solved using ‘Time Integration 

–  Rotation  Matrices’  method  with  a  three-dimensional  (3D)  complex  fast  Fourier 

transformation (FFT) method. In the simulation, ‘Time Step’ of 1 ps, maximum iteration 

of 25000 with damping coefficient α = 1.0 was used for fast convergence at each step to 

find  the  equilibrium  magnetization  at  each  magnetic  field  step.  For  calculating  the 

hysteresis loops the magnetic field (H) was ramped between up to ±5000 Oe depending 

on the saturation field of the sample. The hysteresis loops and magnetoresistance loops 

averaged  over  the  sample  volume  are  collected  for  each  sample.  In  addition,  the 

magnetization distributions over the magnetic layers for each sample have been studied 

to understand the reversal modes and spatial coherence of magnetization switching.

III.  A.  Effects  of  Element  Shape  on  Magnetic  Switching  and  Magnetoresistive 

Behavior of Spin Valve Elements.

maximum magnetic field was adjusted according to the saturation of magnetization 
for each element. The magnetic field is applied along x-axis. 

The  simulated  magnetic  hysteresis  loops  with  magnetic  field  applied  along  x-axis, 

showing  the  magnetization  switching  behavior,  magnetoresistance  and  extracted 

magnetic parameters (Hc, Mr and Hsat) for the rectangular Co/Cu/Py spin valve elements 

with varying AR are shown in Fig. 1. For AR = 0.5, a hard-axis-like loop is observed with 

a small hysteresis at the center. This is because the elements undergo a transition from 

easy-axis to hard-axis of its shape anisotropy  w.r.t. the applied field direction with the 

reduction of AR. For 1.0 ≤ AR ≤ 2.5, we observe two-step switching, with the squareness 

of the loops increasing, with the increase in AR. The size of the plateaus also increases, as 

we increase the AR. We observe the systematic decrease in Hsat until 1.5 kOe at AR = 1.5, 

after which it decreases gradually and the systematic increase in Hc with the increase in 

AR. For AR = 0.5, a narrow MR loop is observed with large spacing. For 1.0 ≤ AR ≤ 2.5, we 

observe that the squareness of the MR loops increases while they become wider with the 

increase in AR, and the space in between decreases. The loops almost merge at AR = 2.5.

We observe the gradual increase in MR % to about 12% with the increase in AR and as 

the loops become wider.

field),  magnetoresistance  and  extracted  magnetic  parameters  (Hc,  Mr  and  Hsat)  as  a 
function  of  AR  for  elliptical  Co/Cu/Py  spin  valve  elements  with  varying  AR.  The 
maximum magnetic field was adjusted according to the saturation of magnetization 
for each element. The magnetic field is applied along x-axis. 

In order to study the effects of element shape, we have simulated elliptical elements with 

dimensions as described before. The simulated magnetic hysteresis loops with magnetic 

field  applied  along  x-axis,  showing 

the  magnetization  switching  behavior, 

magnetoresistance and extracted magnetic parameters (Hc, Mr and Hsat) for the elliptical 

Co/Cu/Py spin valve elements with varying AR are shown in Fig. 2. For the AR = 0.5, we 

observe a hard-axis-like loop with no hysteresis at the center of the loop. For the AR = 

1.0, we observe a single-step switching with increased squareness of the loop than AR = 

0.5  with  some  hysteresis  at  the  center.  For  0.5  ≤  AR  ≤  1.0,  the  switching  observed  in 

incoherent. For 1.25 ≤ AR ≤ 2.5, we observe a two-step switching, with the squareness of 

the  loops  increasing  further,  with  the  increase  in  AR  and  the  magnetic  field  switching 

observed is coherent. The size of the plateaus also increases, as we increase the AR. We 

observe a systematic decrease in Hsat and increase in Hc with the increase in AR. For AR = 

0.5, a narrow MR loop is observed with large spacing between the two loops. For 1.0 ≤ AR 

≤ 2.5, we observe a systematic increase in the squareness of the MR loops while they also 

7 

 
  
become  wider  with  the  increase  in  AR,  while  the  spacing  between  the  two  loops 

decreases. The loops almost merge at AR = 2.5. Here too, we observe a gradual increase 

in MR % up to > 9% with the increase in AR and as the loops become wider.

field),  magnetoresistance  and  extracted  magnetic  parameters  (Hc,  Mr  and  Hsat) as  a

cell spacing. The maximum magnetic field was adjusted according to the saturation of 
magnetization for each element. The magnetic field is applied along x-axis. 

We further studied the effects of dipolar interactions in an array of spin valve elements 

on their magnetization reversal and MR behaviour. This is crucial as complex the inter-

element dipolar interaction between the elements can significantly modify the magnetic 

switching field and MR as well as the spatial coherence of switching. A cross-talk between 

the elements is not desirable for their independent operation, whereas elements cannot 

be  placed  too  far  away  to  avoid  the  cross-talk  for  the  benefit  of  areal  density  of  the 

magnetic recording technology. The simulated magnetic hysteresis loops with magnetic 

field  applied  along  x-axis,  showing 

the  magnetization  switching  behavior, 

magnetoresistance  and  extracted  magnetic  parameters  (Hc,  Mr  and  Hsat)  for  the  2x2 

elliptical arrays of Co/Cu/Py spin valve elements with varying AR is shown in Fig. 3. We 

took into consideration, 2x2 elliptical arrays with cell spacings of 10 nm ≤ S ≤ 500 nm. 

For all the cell spacings, two-step switching is observed and the squareness of the loops 

increases with the increase with the cell spacing. The size of the plateaus increases as we

increase the cell spacing. We observe a sharp decrease in Hsat from S = 10 nm to S = 25 

nm, and a gradual decrease beyond that. We also observe a sharp increase in Hc from S = 

10 nm to S = 25 nm, and a gradual increase after that. For 0.5 ≤ S ≤ 2.5, we observe that 

the squareness of the MR loops increases while they become narrower with the increase 

in cell spacing, and the space between increases gradually. We observe a gradual decrease

become narrower. 

When  we  increased  the  number  of  elements  in  the  array,  the  behaviour  remained 

qualitatively  similar  despite  small  quantitative  changes.  The  simulated  magnetic 

hysteresis  loops  with  magnetic  field  applied  along  x-axis,  showing  the  magnetization 

switching behavior, magnetoresistance and extracted magnetic parameters (Hc, Mr and 

Hsat)  for  the  3x3  elliptical  arrays  of  Co/Cu/Py  spin  valve  elements  with  varying  AR  is 

shown in Fig. 4. We took into consideration, 3x3 arrays with cell spacings of 10 nm ≤ S ≤ 

250 nm. For cell spacings of 10 nm ≤ S ≤ 50 nm multi-step switching is observed. For cell 

spacings  of  150  nm  ≤  S  ≤  250  nm  two-step  coherent  switching  is  observed  with  the 

squareness  of  the  loops  increasing  with  the  increase  in  cell  spacing.  The  size  of  the 

plateaus increases as we increase the cell spacing. We observe the large decrease in Hsat

from ~850 Oe at S = 10 nm to ~650 Oe at S = 50 nm, after which it remains constant at 

650 Oe and large increase in Hc from S = 10 nm (~815 Oe) to S = 25 nm (~880 Oe), after 

which it increases systematically and slows down at S = 150 nm. For 0.5 ≤ S ≤ 2.5, we 

observe that the squareness of the MR loops increases while they become narrower with 

the increase in cell spacing, and the space between increases gradually. We observe the 

gradual  decrease  in  MR  %  with  the  increase  in  cell  spacing  and  as  the  loops  become 

narrower. 

III.  B.  Effect  of  Element  Shape  on  the  Magnetization  Reversal  Modes  of  the  Spin 

Valve Elements. 

Understanding  the  magnetization  reversal  mechanism  is  important  in  nanoscale 

magnetism and its application in memory devices [21]. We have further simulated the 

magnetization  distributions  (maps)  of  two  magnetic  layers  during  the  magnetization 

reversal  (switching).  In  Fig.  5.  we  show  the  magnetization  maps  of  the  Co  and  the  Py 

layers at some important magnetic field values for three rectangular shaped spin valve 

elements  with  AR  of  2.5,  1.5  and  0.5.  The  magnetization  maps  are  placed  next  to  the 

corresponding hysteresis loops where the arrows indicate the field values at which the 

maps are simulated. For AR = 0.5, both Co and Py layers are fully aligned along the +x 

direction at the +ve saturation field (1). While descending down the loop, the Co and Py 

layers partially get demagnetized at (2). At H = -200 Oe (3) the Py layer partially switches 

its  magnetization  towards  -x  direction  forming  an  S-state,  while  the  Co  layer 

magnetization  partially  retains  towards  +x  direction  although  its  magnetization  at  the 

central parts starts to deviate from the +x direction forming an opposite S-state w.r.t. the 

Py layer.  At H = -250 Oe, where a minor switching in the hysteresis loop is observed (4), 

the Co layer switches to -x direction but the Py layer switches back to the +x direction. 

This unusual observation occurs due to the fact that at this small external magnetic field

the magnetization maps are presented are marked by numbers.  

the dynamics is dominated by the dipolar interaction field, the latter favours antiparallel 

alignment of the neighbouring magnetic layers. At the  -ve saturation field (6) both the 

layers coherently switch their magnetization to -x-direction. For AR = 1.5, in the positive 

saturation  (1),  both  the  Co  and  Py  layers  are  fully  aligned  along  +x-direction  at  +ve 

saturation field. The edge regions of the Co layer are deviated from +x-direction, and the 

Py layer forms an S-state as we descend to (2). At the 1st plateau (3) the Py layer switches 

coherently,  while  Co  layer  retains  its  magnetization  direction  and  gets  more 

demagnetized at the end of the 1st plateau (4). At the -ve saturation (3) both the layers 

switch towards the -ve field direction. For AR = 2.5, in the positive saturation (1), both 

the Co and Py layers are fully aligned along +x-direction at +ve saturation field. Their edge 

regions are deviated from +x-direction as we descend to (2). At the 1st plateau (3) the Py 

layer  switches  coherently,  while  Co  layer  retains  its  magnetization  direction  and  gets 

more demagnetized at the end of the 1st plateau (4). At the -ve saturation (3) both the 

layers switch towards the -ve field direction. 

In Fig. 6. we show the magnetization maps of the Co and the Py layers at some important 

magnetic field values for four different elliptical shaped spin valve elements with AR of 

2.5,  1.25,  1.0  and  0.5.  The  magnetization  maps  are  placed  next  to  the  corresponding 

hysteresis  loops  where  the  arrows  indicate  the  field  values  at  which  the  maps  are 

simulated. For AR = 0.5, at the +ve saturation field (1) the magnetization of Co and Py 

layers are aligned along the +x direction. At H = 0 Oe (2), both the Py and Co layers enter 

into two opposite edge domain states. The magnetic states change continuously and at 

the -ve saturation field (3) both the layers fully switch their magnetization towards  -x 

direction. For AR = 1.0, at the +ve saturation field (1), the magnetization of the Co and Py

layers are aligned along the +x direction. While approaching the 1st plateau (2), the Py 

layer enters into an S-state while Co layer retains its magnetization direction. At the end 

of the 1st plateau, the Py layer completely switches to –ve magnetization (3). After the 

switching to (4), the Co layer switches to -x direction but the Py layer switches back to 

the  +x  direction  due  to  strong  dipolar  interaction  between  the  two  layers.  At  the  -ve 

saturation (5) both the layers fully switch their magnetization towards -x direction. For 

AR = 1.25, at the +ve saturation field (1), the magnetization of the Co and Py layers are 

aligned along the +x direction. Till the end of the 1st plateau (4), the Co layer retains its 

original magnetization, while the Py layer coherently switches  its magnetization to -ve 

direction at (2). At the -ve saturation (5) both the layers fully switch their magnetization 

towards -x direction. For AR = 2.5, clear two-step switching is observed. Here, at the +ve 

12 

 
 
saturation field (1), the magnetization of the Co and Py layers are aligned along the +x 

direction as usual. At the 1st plateau (2), the Co layer retains its original magnetization, 

while the Py layer coherently switches to –ve magnetization. At the end of this plateau

the Co layer also coherently switches its magnetization and at the -ve saturation field (3) 

both  the  layers  have  their  magnetization  switched  towards  -x  direction.  The  shape 

anisotropy of this sample along the applied field direction helps this stepwise coherent 

switching of magnetization. 

To  reveal  the  role  of  inter-element  dipolar  coupling  on  the  magnetization  reversal 

mechanisms of these spin valve elements, we investigate the magnetization maps of the 

Co and the Py layers at some important magnetic field values for 2x2 elliptical arrays of 

spin valve elements with AR of 1.25 and two different cell spacings. The magnetization 

maps are placed next to the corresponding hysteresis loops where the numbers indicate 

the field values at which the maps are simulated. For cell spacing S = 10 nm, at the +ve 

saturation field (1), both the Co and Py layers are aligned along the +x direction. At point 

(2), we notice that the Py elements starts to demagnetize at their corners while the Co 

elements maintain their magnetization direction. At points (3, 4), the Py forms C-states. 

At point (5), the elements in the Py layer completely switch their magnetization direction 

to -x. At point (6), switching of the Co elements nucleate at their edges and at the second 

switching  point  (7),  the  elements  in  the  Co  Layer  also  switch  their  magnetization 

direction to  -x  direction.  At  a  large cell spacing  (S = 250 nm)  where  the  inter-element

interaction  field  become  much  weaker  the  reversal  behaviour  does  not  change 

significantly. The only discernible change is observed in the first switching step, where 

the Py elements initially formed S-like state (2) followed the complete switching of the 

top row elements, while the bottom row elements still retain the S-like state (3). From 

the 1st plateau (4) onward, the reversal behaviour for this sample is identical to what has 

been observed for the sample with S = 10 nm. This indicated that once the initial reversal 

barrier is crossed the in-element interaction field.    

Fig. 10. Magnetization reversal states of Co and Py layers of the 3x3 arrays of elliptical 
spin  valve  elements  with  AR  =  1.25,  of  cell  spacing  10  nm.  The  magnetic  fields 
corresponding  to  which  the  magnetization  maps  are  presented  are  marked  by 
numbers. 

We  subsequently  investigate  how  the  magnetization  reversal  mechanism  of  the  spin 

valve elements changes if we increase number of elements in a densely packed array. In 

Fig. 10. we show the magnetization maps of the Co and the Py layers at some important 

magnetic field values for a 3x3 elliptical array of spin valve elements with AR of 1.25 and 

a cell spacing of 10 nm. The magnetization maps are placed next to the corresponding 

hysteresis  loop  where  the  numbers  indicate  the  field  values  at  which  the  maps  are 

simulated. At the +ve saturation field (1), both the Co and Py layers are aligned along the 

+x direction. At point (2), we notice that six of the Py elements lying on the left and right 

columns near the two boundaries form C-states, while the elements on the middle column 

retain  its  initial  magnetization  states.  The  Co  elements  also  retain  their  original

magnetization direction.  After the first switching a small plateau is formed (3) where the 

Py elements in the top and bottom rows fully switch their magnetization to -x direction, 

while two elements in the middle row remain in C-states and the central one retains its 

original magnetization. This is followed by another switching where a wider plateau is 

formed (4), where we notice that the Py layer elements have completely switched to -x 

magnetization direction. During the next switching another small plateau is formed (5) 

where  three  elements  of  the  Co  layer  switch  to  -x  magnetization  direction  while  the 

remaining  elements  starts  to  show  some  edge  nucleation  regions  for  magnetization 

reversal. This is followed by the final switching in the field sweep from +ve to -ve field 

direction  (6),  where  both  the  layers  have  completely  switched  to  -x  magnetization 

direction.  

IV. Conclusions: 

In  summary,  we  have 

investigated  the  magnetic  switching  mechanism  and 

magnetoresistive  behaviour  in  single  spin  valve  elements  of  two  different  shapes  and 

having  a  varying  lateral  aspect  ratio  and  arrays  of  the  elliptical  elements  having  a 

constant  aspect  ratio  but  varying  cell  spacing  by  using  computational  micromagnetic 

simulations. We observe that the elements with higher AR show the Ni80Fe20 (Py) and Co 

layers forming antiparallel states in the plateau similar to synthetic antiferromagnets. As 

we reduce the AR, more complex quasi-uniform magnetic states are observed which are 

even  more  complicated  for  elliptical  elements.  The  elliptical  elements  with  the  aspect 

ratio of 1.25 shows coherent and predictable switching behavior, showing its suitability 

for  the  application  in  magnetic  memory  elements.  We  observe  a  gradual  increase  in 

magnetoresistance (MR%) with the increase in AR of the spin valve  elements, and the 

decrease in interelement spacing between the spin valve elements in their arrays. The 

array  with  the  highest  interelement  spacing  of  250  nm  shows  the  most  coherent  and 

predictable  switching  behavior.  Such  complex  magnetization  reversal  gives  clear 

indication of the dominance of incoherent magnetization reversal in such nanoscale spin 

valve elements. The reversal mechanism is correlated with the various parameters of the 

magnetic hysteresis loops as well as the magnetoresistance of the individual elements as 

well  as  the  array.  While  more  studies  will  be  required  in  the  future  on  elements  of 

different  shapes,  sizes,  magnetic  materials,  interlayer  interaction  and  geometry  of  the 

array,  such  correlations  will  set  up  guiding  principles  for  the  choice  of  the  material, 

15 

 
geometric  shape  and  array  geometry  for  optimal  functionality  of  nanoscale  spin  valve 

arrays.  Numerical  simulations  covering  this  hyper-parameter  space  and  their 

optimization seems tedious. Here the usage of machine learning tools such as supervised 

machine learning including different regression methods, very fast simulated annealing 

algorithm,  learning  a  mapping  of  spin  configurations  with  simulation  parameters  etc. 

would be useful for the optimization process [22-23].
