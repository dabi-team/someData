Abstract. Building on the successful experience in operating the DarkSide-50 detector, the Dark-
Side Collaboration is going to construct DarkSide-20k, a direct WIMP search detector using a
two-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (ﬁducial) mass of
23 t (20 t). The DarkSide-20k LAr TPC will be deployed within a shield/veto with a spherical
Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV) inside a cylindrical Water Cherenkov Veto (WCV). Operation
of DarkSide-50 demonstrated a major reduction in the dominant 39Ar background when us-
ing argon extracted from an underground source, before applying pulse shape analysis. Data
from DarkSide-50, in combination with MC simulation and analytical modeling, shows that a
rejection factor for discrimination between electron and nuclear recoils of >3 × 109 is achiev-
able. This, along with the use of the veto system, is the key to unlocking the path to large
LAr TPC detector masses, while maintaining an “instrumental background-free” experiment,
an experiment in which less than <0.1 events (other than ν-induced nuclear recoils) is expected
to occur within the WIMP search region during the planned exposure. DarkSide-20k will have
ultra-low backgrounds than can be measured in situ. This will give sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon
cross sections of 1.2 × 10−47 cm2 (1.1 × 10−46 cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2 (10 TeV/c2) mass,
to be achieved during a 5 yr run producing an exposure of 100 t yr free from any instrumental
background. DarkSide-20k could then extend its operation to a decade, increasing the exposure
to 200 t yr, reaching a sensitivity of 7.4 × 10−48 cm2 (6.9 × 10−47 cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2
(10 TeV/c2) mass.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

1 Introduction

The existence of dark matter in the Universe, proposed by Jan Oort [1] and Fritz Zwicky [2,3] in the 1930s,
is commonly accepted as the explanation of many astrophysical and cosmological phenomena, ranging from
internal motions of galaxies [4] to the large scale inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background radi-
ation [5] and the dynamics of colliding galaxy clusters [6]. It is accepted today in the scientiﬁc community
that roughly 85 % of the matter in the universe is in some non-baryonic form that neither emits nor absorbs
electromagnetic radiation. Alternatives, such as theories involving modiﬁcations to Einstein’s theory of grav-
ity, have not been able to explain the observations across all scales. A favored hypothesis that explains these
observations is that dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), heavy enough to
have been in non-relativistic motion when they decoupled from the hot particle plasma in the early stages of
the expansion of the Universe. However, no such particles exist in the Standard Model [7,8] and none have
been directly observed at particle accelerators or elsewhere. Hence the nature of the dark matter remains
unknown.

While the Standard Model of particle physics does not include a viable dark matter candidate, several
models of physics beyond the Standard Model (e.g., supersymmetry [9,10,11, 12,13] with R-parity conserva-
tion) do propose the existence of WIMPs. Thus, besides accounting for the dark matter in the universe, the
discovery of WIMPs would give observational evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model, paving
the way for a new “Particle Physics Paradigm”.

There are three broad classes of WIMP searches: direct detection in shielded underground detectors;
indirect detection with satellites, balloons, and ground-based telescopes looking for signals of dark matter
annihilation; and detection at particle colliders where dark matter particles may be directly produced in
high-energy collisions.

At the LHC, the ATLAS and CMS experiments search for dark matter particles pair produced in pp
collisions. A hard jet emitted as initial state radiation provides the trigger, and a large visible momentum
imbalance betrays the unseen stable particle. The range of dark matter particle masses accessible at the LHC
is limited by the total center of mass energy, which at 13 TeV/c2 results in decreasing sensitivity for WIMP
masses above a few hundred GeV/c2 [14,15]. As the luminosity in the LHC Run II rapidly accumulates,
it is expected that the sensitivity of ATLAS and CMS will remain competitive with existing or planned
direct dark matter search experiments for very low (< 10 GeV/c2) WIMP masses and provide powerful
constraints for many classes of dark matter interactions for high WIMP masses. The WIMP mass coverage
and interaction sensitivity of LHC searches are often complementary to those of direct dark matter searches.
Indirect searches for dark matter annihilation products are prompted by models in which the dark matter
particles can interact with one another, converting their rest mass into ordinary particles. Searches for ﬁnal
states including neutrinos, antiprotons, positrons and γ-rays are performed from a variety of astrophysical
sources expected to harbor gravitationally conﬁned populations of dark matter particles. Notably, data
from the PAMELA satellite-borne experiment show a positron excess in the cosmic rays with dark matter
annihilation suggested as a possible cause [18]. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) measurements of
the primary cosmic-ray electron and positron ﬂuxes each require more than a single power-law spectrum
to be correctly described [19], and while this constrains certain dark matter annihilation channels, it still
leaves viable some dark matter decay channels [20]. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is an imaging
high-energy γ-ray telescope ranging from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV and has shown an emission from
the Galactic center that cannot be fully described by background models [21,22]. This emission has been
suggested to be the result of dark matter annihilation at the Galactic center (see Ref. [23] and references
cited therein). The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), which passed the ﬁrst phase of its Critical Design
Review in 2015 and is to be constructed during 2018-2023 would be sensitive to high energy photons from
the inner Milky Way and dwarf galaxies due to thermally annihilating dark matter particles up to 10 TeV/c2
in mass [24]. Annihilation of low-mass WIMPs (down to 5 GeV/c2) in the Sun and the galactic center would
be detectable with the PINGU extension to ICECUBE [25], if it is funded. Indirect astrophysical searches
can reach high sensitivity for annihilating dark matter particles. They have the advantage of associating
any signals with cosmic accumulations of dark matter, but most of which are subject to the kind of model
uncertainties inherent to astrophysical observations.

A great variety of direct dark matter searches, utilizing diﬀerent technologies, have been running in recent
years and are planned for the future. These include cryogenic bolometers with ionization or scintillation
detection (CDMS [26,27,28,29], SuperCDMS [30], EDELWEISS [31], CRESST [32]), sodium/cesium iodide
scintillation detectors (DAMA/LIBRA [33,34,35], KIMS [36]), bubble chambers (PICASSO [37], COUPP [38,
39], PICO [40,41]), point contact germanium detectors (CoGeNT [42,43,44,45], MALBEK [46]), detectors
using liquid xenon (ZEPLIN [47], XENON-100 [48,49, 50], LUX [51,52,53,54], XMASS [55], PandaX-I [56],

and adapted to include the most recent results from references cited elsewhere in this section). The mean exclusion
sensitivities for the full exposure of DarkSide-50, for DarkSide-20k, and for Argo (accounting for the ν-induced
background) are shown. For comparison, the mean exclusion sensitivity for a generic argon-based experiment with
a 30 keVnr threshold, 100 % acceptance for nuclear recoils, and expectation of one coherent neutrino-nucleus scatter
during the lifetime of the experiment is also shown. The grey shaded region is bounded from above by the “coherent
neutrino-nucleus scattering ﬂoor”, the ultimate experimental reach for a xenon based experiment with arbitrary
exposure, limited by the uncertainty on the ν-induced background, introduced in Ref. [17].

PandaX-II [57], XENON1T [58,59], LZ [60,61], XENONnT [62]), detectors using liquid argon (ArDM [63,
64,65], MiniCLEAN [66], DEAP-3600 [67], WArP [68, 69], and, described in this proposal, DarkSide-50 [70,
71]). These detectors all share the common goal of achieving a suﬃciently low threshold energy to detect the
collisions of WIMPs with target nuclei, as well as low enough background to identify these extremely rare
events as from non-standard sources. Recent results from these experiments are shown in Fig. 1, along with
projected sensitivities from the DarkSide program.

Among all dark matter detectors to date, the XENON-1T collaboration has obtained the most sensitive
limits on spin-independent interactions of WIMPs with nuclei, using a xenon target to place a limit on the
WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section of 7.7 × 10−47 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 35 GeV/c2 [59]. Evidence
for a low-mass dark matter signal has been claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA [34] and CoGeNT [42,43,44,45]
collaborations, and may be consistent with observations of the CDMS collaboration using Si detectors [28].
However, these claims are in tension with a number of other strong results, including those of LUX [53,
54], XENON-100 [48,49,50], the low-energy analysis of SuperCDMS Ge detectors data [30], and the result
from MALBEK [46]. The positive claims are also in strong contradiction with the results from XENON-
1T, which directly rule out the interpretation of COGENT and CDMS/Si [28] results in terms of low-mass
WIMPs. With these results in hand, the region of cross section around 10−39 cm2 expected for Z-mediated
scattering [72] seems to be fully explored now - and excluded.

The motivation for direct WIMP searches remains extremely strong, especially for high (above a few
hundred GeV/c2) masses that will be out of the LHC reach, and the region of low cross sections (10−45 cm2
to 10−47 cm2) corresponding to H-mediated scattering [72]. To discover the nature of dark matter particles, it
is important for direct and indirect detection to reach new levels of sensitivity, improving current sensitivity
levels by a few orders of magnitude. The complementarity between direct and indirect search strategies will
play an important part in the discovery of dark matter. For the direct-detection searches, the ability to build
experiments able to operate in a background-free mode will be crucial for a possible discovery of dark matter.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

In this spirit, the four world-leading argon dark matter projects (ArDM at LSC, DarkSide-50 at LNGS,
DEAP-3600 at SNOLab and MiniCLEAN at SNOLab) agreed on joining forces to carry out a uniﬁed program
for LAr dark matter direct detection in the framework of the DarkSide-20k project [73]. In December 2015,
the DarkSide Collaboration submitted a proposal to Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) and to
the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the funding of the DarkSide-20k experiment. The DarkSide-20k
experiment aims at a signiﬁcant improvement - a factor of at least 170 with respect to the recent LUX
result [54] - in the sensitivity for the direct detection of WIMPs, reaching 1.2 × 10−47 cm2 for WIMPs of
1 TeV/c2 mass. It is proposed to achieve this goal with a liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr TPC)
experiment with an active (ﬁducial) mass of 23 t (20 t), for a total exposure of 100 t yr to be accumulated
in a run of 5 yr. Thanks to its exceptionally low instrumental background, DarkSide-20k could extend its
operation to a decade, increasing the exposure to 200 t yr and reaching a sensitivity of 7.4 × 10−48 cm2. In
April 2017 the DarkSide-20k experiment was oﬃcially approved by INFN, with expectation that formal
agreements with international partners will soon be in place.

2 The Case for DarkSide-20k: An Instrumental Background-Free Dark Matter Search

Fig. 2. Number of dark matter-like events needed to claim a WIMP observation at the 5 σ level, based on the
predicted background rate of the experiment, in a linear-linear scale. Solid lines show the number of dark matter-like
events needed, including backgrounds, while dashed lines show the number of dark matter events after subtraction of
the expected background. Blue, green, and purple curves were made assuming uncertainty on the background model
of 100 %, 10 %, and 1 %, respectively.

The goal of DarkSide-20k is to discover dark matter. With dark matter interactions very rare, and the
onset of ν-induced nuclear recoils for exposures of 100 t yr and beyond, it is of essence to contain the number
of instrumental background interactions to <0.1 events, so that a positive claim can be made with as few
events as possible. A discovery for dark matter could come at any exposure level, and even a low but non-zero
instrumental background can hinder the task of discovering dark matter.

Before going into the details of how backgrounds aﬀect sensitivity, it is ﬁrst important to draw a ﬁrm
distinction: it is statistically much easier to exclude a region of parameter space than it is to make a detection.
Typical exclusion relies on a standard of 90 % likelihood, while a positive detection requires a 5 σ standard:

this is equivalent to saying that, once a reliable background model for the experiment has been built, the
observed signal has a probability of 3 × 10−7 of being an artifact of statistical ﬂuctuations in the background.
A signal 3 σ above the null hypothesis has a probability of 10−3, and is generally referred to as “evidence”,
while a 1 σ deviation, with a probability of 0.16, is “uninteresting”.

Fig. 2 shows the number of WIMP-like events an experiment would need to observe in order to reject
the null hypothesis to 5 σ as a function of the number of expected background events, when the background
model predicts the background with 100 %, 10 %, and 1 % uncertainty. As is evident from the ﬁgures, there
is fairly little diﬀerence between 10 % and 1 % uncertainty. This results from the uncertainty in the model
being small enough, so that the Poisson ﬂuctuations dominate the statistics. When the model predicts 0 or
0.1 background events, just 5 WIMP-like events can be statistically signiﬁcant enough to claim a detection at
the 5 σ level. However, if an experiment expects to see even one background event, the number of WIMP-like
events needed for a discovery goes up to 10 to 15, depending on the uncertainty in the background model.
This means that a dark matter experiment expecting one background event will need up to 3 times more
WIMP interactions to claim a detection, compared to an experiment which plans to run background-free. The
requirement becomes increasingly more restrictive if the expected number of background events is greater
than 10. More details of this calculation can be found in [74].

Among the variety of detector technologies, noble liquid TPCs, which detect both the scintillation light
and the ionization electrons produced by recoiling nuclei, have signiﬁcant advantages for direct dark matter
searches. For liquid argon (LAr), the powerful discrimination against background using the time-development
of the primary scintillation signal (pulse-shape discrimination or PSD), the precise determination of event
positions in all three dimensions given by the TPC, and the eﬀectiveness of chemical and cryogenic puriﬁ-
cation of the argon have all been demonstrated (see Refs. [75,70] and references cited therein). The speciﬁc
goal of searching for and discovering high-mass dark matter particles allows the search to be concentrated
in the range of recoil energies from 30 keVnr to 200 keVnr (WIMP search region). In this region, argon de-
tectors outperform other technologies with their outstanding β/γ background rejection, as ﬁrst pointed out
by Boulay and Hime [76] and veriﬁed by WArP [69] and DarkSide-50 [70].

The DarkSide Collaboration has published background-free WIMP search results (<0.1 events expected
and no observed events in the search region) from an exposure of (1422 ± 67) kg day with atmospheric argon
(AAr) [70] and from a separate exposure of (2616 ± 43) kg day with underground argon (UAr) [71]. The
combined result of the AAr and UAr data analysis, as discussed below, leads to the expectation that a result
free from instrumental background can also be obtained from a much larger exposure with a multi-tonne
detector.

In addition to choosing a detector technology and target, the exact conﬁguration of the target is an
important choice. The light quenching in LAr introduced by the presence of a drift ﬁeld was ﬁrst discovered
and then precisely measured by the SCENE experiment [77]. The precise measurements obtained with
SCENE leads to the choice of a drift ﬁeld of 200 V/cm for, which minimally penalizes the light yield of
nuclear recoils, containing its loss within 10%, and resulting in a barely noticeable loss of performance.
Ultimately the reconstruction of energy of the events is based on the consideration of both the scintillation
signal, S1, and the ionization signal, S2, and so a very good resolution can be obtained.

The choice of using single- or dual-phase geometry is driven by the need to obtain the best performance
in WIMP dark matter searches, and not a need for optimizing event reconstruction in terms of S1 and f90,
the fraction of S1 light detected in the ﬁrst 90 ns of the pulse. The dual-phase LAr detector DarkSide-50 has
demonstrated an impressive performance in background rejection by producing two independent background-
free results, with AAr [70] and UAr [71]. The dual-phase xenon detectors have also achieved an impressive
performance and lead the race for WIMP dark matter sensitivity. No single-phase detector has yet to produce
a WIMP dark matter result comparable. The main diﬃculty encountered by the ﬁrst generation of single
phase detectors can be traced to the lack of an S2 signal, without which the precise ﬁducialization that is
typical of dual-phase detectors is no longer possible. In absence of this ﬁducialization, surface background
and background from Cherenkov events originating in the PMTs fused silica and in the Teﬂon reﬂector
dominate. Experience with the DarkSide-50 detector is indeed very similar, where as the two campaigns of
data mentioned above would be far from background-free if the S2 signals were not present, for the very
reason stated above. In fact, when artiﬁcially turning oﬀ the S2 signal in the DarkSide-50 data analysis stage,
the background-free condition is lost, and the surface and Cherenkov backgrounds contribute events to the
ﬁnal data sample, within the WIMP search region.

On this basis, an enlarged DarkSide Collaboration proposes the construction of DarkSide-20k, a direct
WIMP search using a LAr TPC with an active (ﬁducial) mass of 23 t (20 t) of UAr. As shown in Fig. 3, the
DarkSide-20k TPC will be deployed underground at LNGS. DarkSide-20k will be a detector with ultra-low
background levels and the ability to measure its backgrounds in situ. It is designed to achieve an exposure of

100 t yr, accumulated during a run of approximately 5 yr, free of instrumental background, giving a sensitivity
to WIMP-nucleon interaction cross sections of 1.2 × 10−47 cm2 (1.1 × 10−46 cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2
(10 TeV/c2) mass. This is a factor of 170 improvement over the corresponding currently published limits,
and covers a large fraction of the mass-cross section parameter space currently preferred by supersymmetric
theories [78]. The projected sensitivity of DarkSide-20k is compared with other current and planned projects
in Table 1.

In the longer term, the aim of the DarkSide collaboration is to develop a path towards a dark matter
detector to be built with a 300 t (200 t) active (ﬁducial) mass of depleted argon (DAr), UAr with an 39Ar
content further depleted by processing the UAr through a cryogenic distillation column. For now, this ultimate
experiment is called Argo. A successful DarkSide-20k experiment would represent a fundamental milestone
toward the realization of Argo. Argo is conceived to accumulate an exposure of 1000 t yr, free of background
other than that induced by coherent scattering of neutrinos, and thus be sensitive to dark matter cross
sections at the “neutrino ﬂoor” [17].

As well as providing the most sensitive WIMP search, Argo would carry out an ambitious program of
precision measurements on low energy solar neutrinos (7Be, pep, and CNO neutrinos) through neutrino-
electron elastic scattering [80]. LAr has a scintillation light yield ten times larger than that of the organic
liquid scintillator target used for solar neutrino spectroscopy in Borexino [81], resulting in much better energy
resolution. Currently, Borexino provides the most sensitive measurement of the low energy solar neutrino
spectra, but is still unable to measure the CNO neutrinos. The higher energy resolution and tighter control
of surface backgrounds could make a precision measurement of the CNO neutrino ﬂux possible in Argo [80].
The use of the two-phase argon technology allows for a sharp deﬁnition of the ﬁducial volume, signiﬁcantly
reducing the systematic error that dominates the measurement of 7Be neutrinos in Borexino. The anticipated
precision of the rates are 2 % for 7Be, 10 % for pep, and 15 % for CNO neutrinos [80].

The low recoil energies and cross sections targeted with DarkSide-20k represent an enormous experimental
challenge, especially in the face of daunting backgrounds from electron recoil interactions and from neutrons
that mimic the nuclear recoil signature of WIMPs. To meet its challenge, DarkSide-20k will exploit the
auxiliary facilities, including radon-free clean rooms, already built at LNGS as part of the DarkSide program.
The cryostat will be placed inside a 8.0 m diameter stainless steel sphere ﬁlled with boron-loaded liquid
scintillator, serving as an active neutron veto (LSV), which in turn will sit inside a newly constructed 15 m
diameter 14.65 m tall stainless steel tank, ﬁlled with ultrapure water, functioning as an active muon veto
(WCV). The LAr TPC will be instrumented with Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPMs) as photosensors. To
provide the UAr target, the DarkSide Collaboration is already establishing, through the Urania and Aria
projects, the entire chain of extraction, puriﬁcation, depletion, transport, and storage of low-radioactivity
argon at the multi-tonne level. In short, DarkSide-20k will perform the most sensitive search for dark matter
yet proposed and will also provide a convincing foundation for a 100 t-scale detector.

In order to deliver a result free from instrumental background (<0.1 events in the 100 t yr exposure),
DarkSide-20k must be built with the goal of completely eliminating or minimizing backgrounds from the
following sources:

Nuclear Recoils

Neutrino-induced coherent nuclear scattering:

With the nuclear recoil energy thresholds needed to achieve the excellent electron recoil rejection in LAr
from pulse shape discrimination (PSD), only atmospheric neutrinos and the diﬀuse supernova neutrino
background are energetic enough to produce nuclear recoils in the WIMP region of interest. Individual
nuclear recoils from coherent scattering of neutrinos from the argon nuclei in the target are indistinguish-
able from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. Calculations checked against those in Ref. [17] predict 1.6 events
from this source in the full DarkSide-20k exposure. Though these events are irreducible background to
the WIMP search, they are also an as-yet-unobserved physics signal.

Neutron scattering:

Since individual elastic neutron scatters are essentially indistinguishable from elastic WIMP scatters,
background from all sources of neutrons must be reduced well below the <0.1 events level. The main sys-
tem that allows this is a highly eﬃcient neutron veto system, similar to that used in DarkSide-50, which
drew from the design of Borexino solar neutrino detector. Direct measurements of the cosmogenic back-
grounds in Borexino and comparison with Monte Carlo simulations [82,83] lead to the expectation that
cosmogenic neutron backgrounds can be kept under control by using veto signals from the LSV and WCV,
with no WIMP-like events expected for exposures much larger than that expected for DarkSide-20k.
Background due to radiogenic neutrons from (α,n) and ﬁssion decays in the construction materials of the
LAr TPC must also be suppressed to below <0.1 events in the 100 t yr exposure. The rate of neutrons
entering the detector will be reduced by using radiopure silicon-based photosensors and careful screening
and selection of construction materials. It is currently foreseen that the biggest contributor to this back-
ground will be the cryostat and the reﬂective panels of the the LAr TPC, therefore, building the cryostat

14

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

from either stainless steel or titanium will be investigated. Any residual neutron rate will be measured
and eﬃciently rejected using the LSV. The sub-centimeter position resolution of the LAr TPC [70] also
helps reducing background from radiogenic neutrons by ﬁducialization and rejecting events with multiple-
sited energy deposition. With careful selection and screening of all construction materials and detector
components, it is foreseen that the background due to radiogenic neutrons from (α,n) and ﬁssion decays
can be kept below the <0.1 events level (see Sec. 14.2).

Electron Recoils

For electron recoils, the successful strategy developed in DarkSide-50 was to reduce the raw rates by
stringent materials screening and selection, then to suppress the remaining events by analysis cuts (ﬁducial
volume, multiple-site energy deposition, etc.), and ﬁnally to apply PSD to identify residual electron recoil
background events. The energy region of interest (ROI) for the WIMP search is 30 keVnr to 200 keVnr, roughly
equivalent to 7 keVee to 50 keVee. Given the eﬀectiveness of self-shielding and ﬁducial cuts against external
backgrounds for large detectors, the most important sources of electron recoil background for DarkSide-20k
are those uniformly distributed throughout the ﬁducial volume and those which come from radioactive decays
within the detector materials. These include decays of radioactive nuclides in the noble liquid target material
itself, and electron scatters induced by solar neutrinos. Based on results from the DarkSide-50 experiment
and Monte Carlo simulations, it has been demonstrated that these backgrounds can be held to below the
required level (<0.1 events) in a 100 t yr exposure, if operated with a low-radioactivity argon target. The
crucial sources of electron recoil background are:

Solar Neutrino-induced Electron Scatters:

Electron scatters from pp neutrinos within the energy ROI occur at a rate of 200 events/(t yr), giving
2.0 × 104 events in the 100 t yr exposure. The β/γ rejection power demonstrated with DarkSide-50 in
its AAr run [70] was better than one part in 1.5 × 107, more than suﬃcient to reject this pp neutrino
background for the entire planned exposure. This would also hold true for the 1000 t yr exposure planned
for Argo.

238U, 232Th, and Daughters:

The radioactive noble element radon may enter and dissolve in the LAr after being produced in the 238U
and 232Th decay chains. The most important background contribution comes from β decays of the radon
daughters whose spectra fall partly within the energy ROI. The 222Rn speciﬁc activity in DarkSide-50
was measured to be below 2 µBq/kg. The 222Rn concentration in DarkSide-20k is expected to be much
lower than the upper limit obtained for DarkSide-50 due to the reduction in the surface-to-volume ratio.
However, even if the 222Rn contamination were at the DarkSide-50 upper limit, only 1000 events/(t yr)
from 214Pb β decays would be expected in the energy ROI, giving 1.0 × 105 events in the total 100 t yr
exposure. Once again the β/γ rejection power demonstrated with DarkSide-50 in its AAr run [70], better
than one part in 1.5 × 107, is more than suﬃcient to exclude this source of background from the WIMP
search region at the level required for an instrumental background free result.

39Ar:

DarkSide-50 accumulated an exposure of (1422 ± 67) kg day with AAr (39Ar speciﬁc activity: 1 Bq/kg),
followed by an exposure of (2616 ± 43) kg day with UAr (39Ar speciﬁc activity: (0.73 ± 0.11) mBq/kg).
Both campaigns provided background-free results, and with 1.5 × 107 events left in the energy ROI,
but located in the electron recoil band, provided a limit on the suppression factor for electron recoil
events >1.5 × 107, provided by PSD alone. Argon extracted from the atmosphere is not an option for
DarkSide-20k with its maximum drift time of 2.5 ms, due to a constant pile-up of events that would exist,
but using UAr with a much reduced 39Ar component solves this constant pile-up problem. To better
understand what ultimate electron recoil rejection factor can be achieved, the Geant4-based MC simu-
lation package tuned using DarkSide-50 data was used to simulate large exposures of 39Ar events inside
the geometry of the DarkSide-20k detector. The simulated events included the readout characteristics,
including SiPM PDE, noise rate and cross-talk, and were then ﬁt using an analytic model of the PSD
parameter to be used in DarkSide-20k. A suppression for 39Ar events using only PSD is estimated to
be >3 × 109, more than suﬃcient to discriminate against the expected 1.8 × 108 remaining 39Ar events
coming from the UAr. This is further supported by the recent results from the DEAP-1 experiment,
which show that a reduction fraction for electron recoils on the order of 1010 can be achieved in a LAr
detector with a scintillation light yield of at least 8 PE/keVee [84].
Argon extracted from the atmosphere with a speciﬁc 39Ar activity of 1 Bq/kg is not an option for
DarkSide-20k with its maximum drift time of 2.5 ms due to constant pile-up of events. This solves the
constant pile-up problem, but still gives 1.8 × 108 beta decays in the design exposure in the WIMP

85Kr:

energy region of interest. A MC simulation of 39Ar events, analytically modeling the PSD parameters
to be used, showed that the achievable discrimination against (any) electron recoils is estimated to be
>3 × 109 (Sec. 14.2), validating the background-free goal entirely from the PSD mechanism. However,
further depletion of UAr via cryogenic distillation is planned for the DarkSide program, in sight of Argo.
The scaled-up extraction of UAr and the production of DAr are described in Sec. 4.

Recent data from DarkSide-50 show that the UAr contains 85Kr at a speciﬁc activity of (2.05 ± 0.13) mBq/kg,
a rate comparable to the 39Ar activity just discussed. The 85Kr in UAr comes either from atmospheric
leaks during the collection and puriﬁcation, or from deep underground natural ﬁssion processes. No at-
tempt was made to remove Kr from the UAr for the DarkSide-50 target, simply because the presence
of 85Kr was not expected at the time of puriﬁcation. For the LAr target, it is expected that the Urania
UAr extraction plant will be able to reduce the 85Kr to a level resulting in a speciﬁc activity much less
than the residual 39Ar. However, if for some reason the Urania plant is unable to reduce the 85Kr to the
desired level, Seruci-I at Aria will be capable of making the necessary chemical puriﬁcation of the UAr.
Kr in Xe has been reduced by a factor ∼1000 per pass by cryogenic distillation [85], which should be
even better for Ar. Calculations show that the Aria cryogenic distillation column can reduce 85Kr and
other chemical impurities by a similar factor of more than 103 per pass, at a rate of O(1 t/day), making
this source of contamination negligible in DarkSide-20k.

Surface Recoils and Cherenkov Backgrounds

Surface recoils occur when a radioisotope decays on the interior surface of the detector. During the decay,
it may eject an alpha particle toward the wall and recoil into the active argon volume, producing a nuclear
recoil signal. In DarkSide-50, a surface recoil rate of 0.8 mBq was observed (across 0.75 m2 of surface area)
and used to do a study of the alpha light yield in LAr [86]. For the WIMP search all the surface events were
rejected through the use of ﬁducial cuts, speciﬁcally a drift time cut. No radial ﬁducial cut was needed, due
to a reduced charge collection eﬃciency along the side wall preventing the events from passing the required
S2 cuts, and to a much lower rate of surface events on the side wall relative to the top and bottom. In the case
that the surface backgrounds do not exactly scale when moving to DarkSide-20k, a radial ﬁducial volume
cut, in addition to the drift time cut, is already envisioned and is taken into account when making the total
exposure calculation. Finally, current research by DarkSide collaborators with the TPB wavelength shifter
shows a long-lived signal associated with surface nuclear recoils that is not present in bulk nuclear recoils.
The long data acquisition windows will be capable of capturing these signals and discriminating them. With
the eﬀectiveness of the drift-time cut seen in DarkSide-50, implementation of a radial ﬁducial volume cut,
and the presence of a long-lived signal component, surface backgrounds will contribute a negligible amount
to the background budget.

Cherenkov background occurs when an electron recoil event is contaminated with Cherenkov light coming
from a β/γ interaction in the surrounding detector materials (acrylic or PTFE), either resulting from multiple
Compton scattering of a single particle or a separate particle interacting in time-coincidence with the ﬁrst.
The Cherenkov light can overlap with the S1 signal from the LAr interaction producing an f90 value that
a nuclear recoil would take. While the distribution of S1 light is a major factor in rejecting these types of
events, the additional information given by the position reconstruction using the S2 signal allows for a more
stringent cut to be placed, ensuring that no Cherenkov background event will survive the cut.

3 Project Overview

Many fundamental design parameters for DarkSide-20k are based on the successful experience of the DarkSide
collaboration in constructing, commissioning, and operating the DarkSide-50 detector in a background-free
mode. The LAr TPC will also be deployed at LNGS, in the underground Hall C, in the center of a newly
constructed active veto system. Fig. 3 shows the projected experimental arrangement, similar to an expanded
version of the DarkSide-50 setup. This section gives a general overview of the project and introduces the
features of the experiment. The LAr TPC, the production of its UAr target, its SiPM photosensors, and its
cryostat and cryogenics system are described in Secs. 4-7.

3.1 The LAr TPC

Energy deposits in the LAr target result in a characteristic production of excited and ionized argon atoms,
according to the underlying process of a recoiling electron or nucleus. Excited argon atoms, which can also

16

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

be produced by recombining ionization charge, lead to an eﬃcient formation of argon excimers decaying
via the emission of scintillation light containing two components with diﬀerent time constants of emission.
Both components combined together to yield an instant light signal S1. Due to the deep UV nature (around
128 nm) of this scintillation light, which is absorbed by most materials, a thin layer of wavelength shifter
must cover all exposed surfaces. Ionization electrons escaping recombination are drifted by an applied electric
ﬁeld to the top of the LAr, where a stronger applied ﬁeld extracts the electrons into the gas pocket above the
liquid. Here the strong ﬁeld accelerates the electrons, enough for them to excite (but not ionize) the argon
gas, producing a secondary scintillation signal S2, proportional to the ionization charge. Photosensors placed
behind wavelength shifter coated windows at the top and bottom of the TPC, read out both scintillation
signals in each event. S1 is used for energy determination, as well as for PSD, the latter is derived from the
ratio of the prompt and delayed light fractions. S2 is used for energy and 3D position measurement of the
event, the vertical coordinate from the drift time between S1 and S2, and the horizontal coordinates from
the light pattern in the top photosensors.

The octagonal LAr TPC will have a height of 239 cm and a distance between parallel walls of 290 cm.
It will be instrumented with a new kind of photosensors, arrays of SiPMs, arranged in assemblies called
photodetector modules (PDMs). Each PDM has an area comparable to that of a 3 (cid:48)(cid:48) photomultiplier tube
(PMT), with the LAr TPC containing 5210 PDMs in total. Substantial eﬀort was put in the developments
of this technology, since SiPMs promise a higher eﬀective quantum eﬃciency, higher reliability at LAr
temperature, and a much higher radiopurity than PMTs. All of these properties are crucial for DarkSide-20k:
PSD, in LAr the most important mechanism for background discrimination, depends critically on the light
yield, while the large material budget of PMTs is often the limiting factor for neutron- and gamma-induced
backgrounds. The LAr TPC will be equipped with arrays of SiPMs, totaling 14 m2 in area. The development
of the SiPMs, readout electronics, and high-radiopurity packaging is described in Sec. 6.

In comparison to DarkSide-50, where a full digitization and recording of the waveform of each PMT
could be achieved, a custom scheme for the sampling of the two-orders-of-magnitude higher channel count of
the SiPM PDMs has to be developed. Design parameters for the data acquisition (DAQ) system are driven
by rates, occupancies, as well as leading edge timing and limited charge information from each channel, to
compromise as little as possible on energy resolution and pulse-shape discrimination. The DAQ system is
described in Sec. 11.

All components of the detector, above all the inner components, like the LAr TPC, the cryostat, the
SiPM arrays, and cables, must be made from materials of highest radiopurity to keep backgrounds as small
as possible. Sec. 13 describes plans for the assay of materials and the determination of their suitability.
Facilities for cleaning the materials and keeping them clean, and, speciﬁcally, avoiding contamination from
radon and radon daughters, are described in Sec. 15.

3.2 The DarkSide-20k Prototype: DarkSide-Proto

In order to demonstrate and test technological developments on a relevant scale, it is planned to build and
operate a ∼1 t prototype. The project is called DarkSide-Proto and is described in Sec. 8. DarkSide-Proto
will be at an intermediate scale between DarkSide-50 and DarkSide-20k, able to test a few number of full
size components intended for use in DarkSide-20k. The cryostat therefore will be produced in two versions,
ﬁrstly in stainless steel, to allow for a fast start of activities, while a second version will be realized from
low-activity titanium, to demonstrate the feasibility of this innovative construction method for the larger
DarkSide-20k cryostat, described in Sec. 5. The size of DarkSide-Proto was chosen to be able to validate
mechanical and PDM components of the DarkSide-20k LAr TPC, including their readout system. The full
size cryogenic system is also planned to be tested in this way, especially the argon condenser, the gas pump,
the fast drain recovery system and the heat recovery system. Functionality and stability control, as well as
safety issues during power failures, puriﬁcation ﬂow rates and general controls are meant to be explored.
The prototype project also serves to validate the readiness of the various production lines in the diﬀerent
institutions of the DarkSide collaboration.

3.3 The Active Vetoes: Water Cherenkov Veto WCV and Liquid Scintillator Veto LSV

The veto system (Sec. 9) is crucial for the suppression of cosmogenic and radiogenic backgrounds originating
from internal detector components, as well as from the surrounding environment. At the LNGS underground
site, a depth of 3800 m.w.e., the rate of cosmic rays is reduced to 1.1/(m2·hr). The outer veto WCV provides

general tagging of cosmic rays and shielding from radioactivity in Hall C and the surrounding rock. The inner
LSV system targets events induced by internally- and externally-generated neutrons with high eﬃciency and
is also eﬀective to detect gamma-induced events in the LAr TPC. Neutrons are detected primarily via capture
on 10B present in the scintillator cocktail, but also via their thermalization signal and/or detection of the
gamma rays from neutron capture in the TPC or the cryostat. The interaction rate in the LSV is a strong
criterion for material selection in DarkSide-20k to allow for the lowest possible veto threshold. Although
the veto threshold will dictate what the ultimate eﬃciency will be for the detection of neutrons in the ﬁnal
detector conﬁguration, the requirement for the neutron detection eﬃciency is set as >99 %, a target that
was achieved in DarkSide-50.

3.4 Calibrations

For the DarkSide-20k detector to reach its physics goals a comprehensive plan of calibration for the LAr TPC,
LSV, and WCV detectors is necessary. The calibration equipment and techniques are described in detail in
Sec. 10.

In the SCENE experiment [87,77] a monochromatic, low energy, pulsed neutron beam at the Notre Dame
Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics was used to study the scintillation light yield from recoiling
nuclei in a small LAr TPC, but only up to 40 keVnr. The DarkSide collaboration is expanding this work
with a new parallel project, the Recoil Directionality (ReD) experiment, described in Sec. 10.10. The ReD
detector is a small LAr TPC (similar in size to SCENE) equipped with the same SiPM tiles planned for
use in DarkSide-20k. ReD is designed to select and measure neutron single elastic scatters on argon nuclei,
by means of a large acceptance neutron spectrometer, composed of an array of liquid scintillator detectors.
Kinematic requirements of the neutron interactions allow for the precise detection of nuclear recoils in the
LAr, since the neutron energy, scattering angle, and drift ﬁeld direction can all be precisely measured with
the use of external neutron detectors.

4 Procurement and Puriﬁcation of the Underground Argon Target

4.1 Overview and Goals

The collaboration has developed a broad strategy to increase the production of UAr to procure the target
required for DarkSide-20k. The Urania project will extract and purify the UAr from the CO2 wells at the
Kinder Morgan Doe Canyon Facility located in Cortez, CO at a production rate of 100 kg/day. It will be
necessary to make a ﬁnal chemical puriﬁcation of the UAr before deployment into the LAr TPC (driven by
the ﬁltration capacity of the getter puriﬁcation unit), bringing the chemical impurity levels to those shown in
Table 2. Additionally, it would be beneﬁcial to further deplete the UAr of 39Ar, giving extended sensitivity
to DarkSide-20k and a level of 39Ar that is acceptable to be used in an experiment such as Argo. The Aria
project will serve to chemically purify the UAr to better than the levels shown in Table 2 using a cryogenic
distillation column called Seruci-I. Aria could also potentially further deplete the UAr of 39Ar by a second,
and larger cryogenic distillation column called Seruci-II. The ultimate goal of the Aria project is to process
about 150 kg/day of argon through Seruci-II to achieve an additional depletion factor between 10 and 100 (in
addition to the reduction of 39Ar already seen in the UAr). However, the ﬁrst objective of the Aria project
is to chemically purify the UAr using Seruci-I. Therefore, the procurement of the UAr for DarkSide-20k is
broken into two main operations, extraction of the UAr by Urania and then chemical puriﬁcation by Aria
using Seruci-I.

4.2 The Urania Project

The Urania project will extract at least 50 t of low-radioactivity UAr, providing the required 35 t of UAr to
ﬁll DarkSide-20k. The Urania project will also lay the groundwork for UAr procurement for future, larger
argon-based detectors such as Argo. The goal of the Urania project is to build a plant capable of extracting
and purifying UAr at a rate of 100 kg/day, from the same source of UAr that was used for the DarkSide-50
detector.

The opportunity to build Urania has grown from the strong relationships between the DarkSide Col-
laboration and the Kinder Morgan and Air Products corporations. Based on gas analysis of the Cortez
stream provided to Kinder Morgan by the DarkSide Collaboration during the extraction of the DarkSide-50
UAr target, a major industrial partnership between Air Products and Kinder Morgan was established to
extract helium from the CO2 at Kinder Morgan’s Doe Canyon facility. The Air Products helium plant began
operation in July 2015 and presently supplies 15 % of the production rate at the National Helium Reserve.
The DarkSide Collaboration reached an agreement with Kinder Morgan to feed the Urania plant with a
small fraction (6 %) of the gas stream returned to Kinder Morgan by Air Products after helium extraction.
This gas stream holds two signiﬁcant advantages over the gas stream used to extract the UAr for DarkSide-50:
it is completely dehydrated, and it contains only trace amounts of helium. These features greatly simplify
the process for UAr extraction by the Urania plant.

Argon from active CO2 wells in southwestern Colorado have been found to contain very low levels of
the radioactive isotope 39Ar, with the concentration shown to be a factor of (1.4 ± 0.2) × 103 below that of
argon derived from the atmosphere [71]. In an eﬀort lasting more than 5 years, DarkSide-50 collaborators
at Princeton and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) extracted and puriﬁed (156 ± 1) kg of
UAr, slightly more than the (153 ± 1) kg needed for the target material in the DarkSide-50 detector.

The Urania feed gas stream is ∼95 % CO2, plus a few percent of N2, one percent CH4, and 440 ppm of
UAr. The processing scheme of the UAr extraction plant is optimized for this feed composition in order to
achieve an UAr purity of better than 99.9 %. A modular plant consisting of skid-mounted units deployable
on concrete platforms is being designed to carry out the processing.

The UAr extraction plant will consist of three gas-processing units, as shown in Fig. 4, followed by a
cryogenic distillation unit. The gas-processing units are two CO2 liqueﬁer/strippers followed by a pressure
swing adsorption unit (PSA). The ﬁrst liqueﬁer accepts gas at 50 bar, with a ﬂow rate of 6500 std m3/h and
a temperature of 5 ◦C. At these conditions the CO2 partially condenses and the stream is separated into
2-phases (gas/liquid) as it goes to the ﬁrst stripper. In the column a controlled quantity of heat is given by a
hot ﬂuid working between the chiller condenser and the column reboilers. The light products are vaporized
and recovered from the top of the column in gas phase. The heavy products (mainly CO2) are collected from
the bottom, compressed to 120 bar and returned to Kinder Morgan as a liquid. The light products coming
from the column head are cooled down in the second step to approximately −50 ◦C and sent to the second
stripper. The ﬁrst column produces 1300 std m3/h of product ﬂow, a factor of 5 reduction in the amount of
gas to be processed by the more complex downstream units.

The second liquefaction and stripping unit further reduces the CO2 content, in a similar process as the
ﬁrst stripping unit. The separated CO2 is joined with that from the ﬁrst unit and returned to Kinder Morgan.

The product gas from the second stripper is re-heated in a heat exchanger and delivered to the PSA unit,
which separates the light fractions, including the argon, from the remaining CO2. The PSA is composed of
four adsorption beds to allow continuous operation with short time adsorption cycles. The desorption of CO2
is made decreasing the pressure on the bed. To optimize the performances, the operation of the adsorbers are
combined by coupling the purge and pressure swing phases. At the outlet of the PSA adsorption tanks, one
buﬀer tank is provided in order to dampen process ﬂuctuations and allow for continuous operations of the
ﬁnal distillation process. The PSA oﬀ-gas is delivered to a recycle compressor and sent back to the second
CO2 stripper inlet for reprocessing.

The PSA is the most critical unit of the entire process since the dynamic adsorption conditions are the
most diﬃcult to simulate and predict. Optimization of the sorbent and other operational parameters is being
done via a small scale lab setup in which breakthrough tests are being performed for a variety of gas species.
A picture of the test setup being used is shown in Fig. 5. Sorbent screening relies on measurements of the
breakthrough curves of the diﬀerent gas species for the candidate sorbents. A selection of sorbents which
could work for the PSA unit have already been deﬁned, while the ﬁnal selection of the exact sorbent to be
used in the UAr extraction plant will be determined by the test results.

The ﬁnal unit of the UAr extraction plant consists of three cryogenic distillation columns. The CO2-
free product coming from the PSA plant is pre-cooled and sent to the ﬁrst column, which works at a lower
pressure (∼9 barg), for the removal of CH4. The second column is used to remove the remaining light fractions
from the resulting N2-rich stream, and the third to perform the ﬁnal puriﬁcation of the UAr using a batch
distillation process. In addition to removing the CH4 and N2 at this point, any 85Kr present in the stream
will also be removed by three cryogenic distillation columns. The CH4-rich and N2-rich distillation wastes
are returned to Kinder Morgan along with the CO2. The ﬁnal product, 99.9 % pure UAr, will be taken in
liquid form from the top of the last column and a small portion collected into a tank to check the quality of
the argon. The majority of the liquid UAr will be sent to the appropriate cryogenic vessels for shipment to
Sardinia, where it will undergo ﬁnal chemical puriﬁcation by the Seruci-I column.

4.3 The Aria Project

The aim of the Aria project is to perform chemical puriﬁcation of the UAr extracted by Urania. Aria will
also be the test bench to develop active depletion of 39Ar from the UAr to possibly provide DAr targets for

20

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

LAr detectors. Aria consists of two 350 m tall distillation columns of diﬀerent processing diameters, Seruci-I
and Seruci-II, capable of separating isotopes by means of cryogenic distillation, a process that exploits the
tiny diﬀerence in volatility due to the diﬀerence in isotopic mass [88,89,90,91,92,93].

Design of the plant started in April 2015 with seed funding from the US NSF through PHY-1314507.
Aria is to be installed in underground vertical shafts of diameter 5 m and depth 350 m, located at the Seruci
mine campus of CarboSulcis, a mining company owned by the Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (RAS). In
February 2015 a proposal was submitted to INFN and RAS, and the funding for the Seruci-I column was
approved on July 24, 2015. Construction of Seruci-I started in September 2015 at Polaris in Italy.

Measurements of the relative volatility of argon isotopes [94, 95,96] and their theoretical interpretation [97,
98,99] marked the birth of the Italian school of condensed matter in Genoa and Milan. The study of the
relative volatility of argon isotopes was recently revisited [100,101], and shows a promising path for the
separation of 39Ar from 40Ar.

Algorithms developed by to calculate the relative volatility of argon isotopes, based on the exten-
sive and detailed models available in the literature, predict that the volatility of 39Ar relative to 40Ar is
1.0015 ± 0.0001, and that it stays constant within theoretical uncertainties in the range of temperatures
practical for the distillation of argon (84 K to 100 K). The small volatility diﬀerence can be used to achieve
active isotopic separation by using a cryogenic distillation system with thousands of equilibrium stages.

Design of the Aria plant was optimized on the basis of high-precision numerical methods for estimat-
ing the isotopic separation of 39Ar from 40Ar. DarkSide Collaborators developed two independent numerical
codes, one based on the McCabe-Thiele method [102], and a second based on the Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland
(FUG) method and its derivative, the Wynn-Underwood-Gilliland (WUG) method [103,104,105]. Calcula-
tions for the isotopic separation power of 39Ar from 40Ar and of the processing rate were performed with
the custom codes as well as with software routines supported by commercial chemical engineering CAD
programs, such as Aspen [106].

Fig. 6 illustrates the core of the process for isotopically separating 39Ar from 40Ar in the UAr. The process
consists mainly of two loops: the process loop, where the argon is distilled and the 39Ar is separated from
the 40Ar and the refrigeration loop where nitrogen gas and liquid is used to evaporate and to condense the
argon. Most of the heat is recovered, thanks to the compressor that pumps the nitrogen gas evaporated in
the condenser to the reboiler and to the pumps that move the liquid nitrogen produced in the reboiler to the
condenser, making the system as eﬃcient as possible. In Fig. 6 all the sub-parts of the plant are represented:
– Feed station, to ﬁlter and regulate the feed to the column;
– Compressor station, to bottle the distillate at the bottom;
– Vacuum system, to keep a good vacuum in the cold-box, in order to minimize the heat losses;
– LN2 storage;
– Nitrogen condenser system, consisting of 4 Stirling cryo-refrigerators needed to re-condense the nitrogen,

used in a close loop.
The two Aria columns, Seruci-I and Seruci-II, will consist of 28 modules of 12 m height, plus a top module
(condenser) and a bottom module (reboiler). Seruci-I is being constructed as a working prototype for the main
column, Seruci-II, and will serve to prove the isotopic separation power of the cryogenic distillation method
before the construction of the large and more expensive Seruci-II. Seruci-I will have the same separation
capabilities as Seruci-II, but a factor of 15 less in the overall production rate of DAr. All modules will be
pre-assembled at the factory and ready for deployment in the shaft. In November 2015, Carbosulcis started
the refurbishment of the Seruci-I mine shaft, in order to make it suitable to host both the Seruci-I and
Seruci-II columns.

Calculations indicate that Seruci-I will be able to process UAr at a rate of O(1 t/day), while removing
all chemical impurities (including traces of N2, O2, and Kr) with separation power better than 103 per pass.
Additionally, Seruci-I will be used to test the isotopic separation of the argon, in order to further reduce
the 39Ar content in the UAr. The same models which have been used to calculate the chemical puriﬁcation
rate, have also been used to show that Seruci-I would be able to isotopically separate the UAr at a rate of
10 kg/day, while obtaining an 39Ar depletion factor of 10 per pass. Scaling the model to the size required for
Seruci-II predicts a processing rate of 150 kg/day, while maintaining the same depletion factor.

Work on Aria is well underway, both at the places where the modules are being constructed and tested and
at the installation site. All modules for Seruci-I have already passed through the phase of pre-construction,
with some of them have already been constructed and tested. After construction of the modules, two com-
plementary leak checks are performed. During the ﬁrst, the process column and all the service pipes are
individually checked for leaks at room temperature. After the ﬁrst check, the pipes are wrapped with su-
perinsulation and everything assembled into the cold box. The second check is a full module check, with an

additional check done on the bottom reboiler module at 77 K. So far, the bottom reboiler, top condenser and
one central module have passed both checks at room temperature and the bottom module is undergoing the
ﬁnal cold temperature check. After the cold test is ﬁnished, the bottom, top and ﬁrst central modules will be
sent to Carbosulcis for installation in a ﬁrst test conﬁguration consisting of just these three initial modules
(top, bottom and one central). Four additional modules are now also ready for the second leak check. A
picture of the top and ﬁrst 4 central modules of Seruci-I are shown in Fig. 7, as they await the second leak
test at CERN.

In parallel with the construction and testing of the models, preparation at the installation site has been
underway for more than two years. Carbosulcis has already obtained all authorizations for the installation
of the initial test of the top, bottom and one central module of Seruci-I, and the building to house the test

has already been prepared and equipped with the required utilities. Refurbishment of the building housing
the winze for the Seruci shaft has been completed, along with the refurbishment of the winze itself. The
refurbishment of the shaft and the surface buildings to support installation and operations has also started.

4.4 Measuring 39Ar Composition in UAr and DAr

To qualify the natural 39Ar depletion in gas extracted from the CO2 wells at Cortez, Colorado, two mea-
surements of the argon in the liquid phase were performed in the past by DarkSide-50 collaborators: one
reported in [107], based on a device measuring 0.5 kg of UAr that was able to set an upper limit for the
residual radioactivity of <0.65 × 10−2 Bq/kg, followed by the direct measurement in DarkSide-50 [71], which
showed a residual 39Ar speciﬁc activity of (0.73 ± 0.11) mBq/kg.

It is not known and not proven that the reduction factor will be the same for all samples of gas extracted
from underground wells, as local rock conditions can signiﬁcantly alter the composition. Therefore, all future
batches of UAr will have to be tested individually. Moreover, the eﬀectiveness of Aria to further suppress the
39Ar content must be experimentally demonstrated. Preliminary studies are ongoing to explore the possibility
of exploiting the ArDM detector, whose collaborators recently joined DarkSide-20k, at the Laboratorio
Sotteraneo de Canfranc, Spain. It could be possible to insert a small O(kg) chamber ﬁlled with the UAr (or
eventually DAr) to be measured in the middle of the ton scale ArDM vessel ﬁlled with AAr. This would
allow for the use of ArDM as an active veto for the gamma background, allowing for the sensitivity that is
required for the measurement to be reached. It is also conceived that, in a second stage, a similar detector
could be built and operated at the Seruci mine site.

4.5 UAr Delivery Plan and Management

The design for DarkSide-20k relies on procurement of the UAr using the Urania argon extraction plant.
In this scenario, the background rejection demonstrated with DarkSide-50, and extended to DarkSide-20k
using MC simulations and analytical techniques, is already suﬃcient to ensure successful reduction of 39Ar
below the <0.1 events goal for background. Seruci-I, and eventually Seruci-II, could then be used to further
deplete the UAr of 39Ar to extend its sensitivity and begin procurement of the required target for a larger
experiment such as Argo.

DarkSide-20k will need 35 t of UAr. The UAr extracted by the Urania plant in Colorado will be shipped to
Sardinia for further chemical puriﬁcation with the Seruci-I column. Several simulations have been performed
in order to evaluate the production rate from Seruci-I, the puriﬁcation performance and the argon recovery
in the cryogenic distillation plant. Assuming a reduction factor of chemical impurities of 103 and an argon
recovery factor of about 85 % each pass, the total amount of UAr needed to produce 35 t that could be used
for DarkSide-20k is thus about 50 t.

The shipment from Colorado to Sardinia will be done by boat in order to minimize the cosmic activation
of the argon. For the shipment of the UAr from Colorado, several options have been analyzed, and the
collaboration has decided that the baseline method will be to ship the UAr in liquid phase using custom
built cryogenic vessels. This is a more eﬃcient and cost eﬀective method, compared to shipping the UAr in gas
phase. The custom built cryogenic vessels will have a double wall structure, there will be two inner volumes
with the larger one containing the UAr and the smaller containing LN2. The outer volume would be at ultra-
high vacuum to thermally insulate the two inner volumes from the atmosphere at ambient temperature.
During the transport, a LN2 fed condenser would slowly re-liquify the UAr as it evaporated away, ensuring
that none of the UAr would be lost during the trip. A schematic view of the cryogenic vessel design is shown
in Fig. 8. A minimum of ﬁve cryogenic vessels is foreseen:
– One for Urania production;
– One for Aria feed;
– One for Aria production;
– Two traveling between Colorado, Sardinia and LNGS.

The extracted UAr will be shipped to Sardinia in batches of 8.8 t (roughly every 100 days) in liquid phase,
also eliminating the need to liquify the UAr to be reprocessed by the Aria column. After chemical puriﬁcation
in Aria, the UAr will then be shipped to Gran Sasso, also in batches of 8.8 t, and stored in the argon recovery
system. In order to minimize the exposure to cosmic rays, the argon will be stored underground at Seruci
and/or Gran Sasso.

5 Cryogenics System and Cryostat

5.1 System Overview

The design of the cryogenics system is largely based on the success of the DarkSide-50 system, with added
improvement and scaling to handle much larger argon mass. The cryogenics system must be able to eﬃciently
cool and purify 50 t of LAr to a purity level similar or better than in DarkSide-50, while also maintaining
similar detector pressure stability. The robust safety features of the DarkSide-50 cryogenics system will be
implemented fully in the DarkSide-20k system, in particular the feature that keeps the system immune to
total power failure (including failure of the UPS system), see Sec. 5.8.

Since the amount of contamination which enters the LAr is proportional to the surface area of materials
inside the cryostat, the puriﬁcation capacity of the system that is initially needed to bring the LAr to the
level required for physics running was estimated based on an approximate surface area scaling between
the DarkSide-50 and DarkSide-20k detectors. The new system should have a total gas recirculation ﬂow
equivalent to 1000 std L/min to initially reach the desired purity of LAr during the course of about one
month. A key feature added to the design concept for DarkSide-20k is the introduction of high eﬃciency
heat exchangers to recover cooling power during fast puriﬁcation circulation. The cryogenics system will
include a new custom-designed argon condenser, again based on the successful DarkSide-50 system. The
cooling power of the argon condenser is variable from 0 kW to 5 kW. This wide cooling power range is
designed to cover fast initial argon ﬁlling (up to 5 kW), as well as normal operations (at about 1.5 kW due
to the need to remove the power consumption of the cold electronics and cryostat heat leak) and TPC-oﬀ
mode (∼150 W). With eﬃcient thermal management, the total external cooling power needed to maintain
the system in TPC-oﬀ mode is about 150 W. A complete overview of the system is shown in Fig. 9.

The argon gas (GAr) puriﬁcation relies on the proven commercial SAES getter system, as in DarkSide-50,
but with a much larger getter to handle the needed ﬂow. A SAES heated-Zr getter with a ﬂow-rate capacity
>1000 std L/min will be able to reduce impurities to the required level. The getter will be integrated into the
cryogenics system so that it can be used to purify GAr simultaneously from the detector or the necessary LAr
recovery system (see Sec. 5.6). The cryogenics system will be located far from the central detector (outside
the LSV and the WCV). Only the small transfer lines 10 m to 15 m long will provide the necessary link for
the LAr delivery from the recovery system.

The main system parameters of the cryogenics system are given in Table 3. The parameters that are
listed in bold are considered to be system requirements, most often driven from experience gained during
operations of the DarkSide-50 cryogenics system.

the argon and nitrogen loops, respectively, while the lighter and darker colors indicate the liquid and gas phases,

for room temperature media.

5.2 System Description

The cryogenics system will consist of the following subsystems: 1. Gas handling system; 2. LAr handling
system including the recovery units, cold liquid transfer lines and other thermal insulation components;
3. Cryostat; 4. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) reserve system as the cold source; 5. Radon trap.

As previously mentioned, the cryogenics system will be designed to maintain the stable working pressure
of argon and continuously purify the argon to maintain the designed purity level. The required argon pressure
stability in the cryostat is ±0.1 psi. This requirement is derived from the required stability in the S2 signal
and was successfully achieved with DarkSide-50 under a variety of heat loads. In fact, the DarkSide-50 system
has maintained a pressure stability within 0.023 psi for a period of more than two years. The required LAr
purity that is needed to achieve a ≥5 ms electron lifetime is less than <0.1 ppb O2. An electron drift lifetime
>11 ms was achieved and measured in DarkSide-50, resulting in a purity so good that no signiﬁcant loss of
electrons was seen across the 400 µs drift.

The DarkSide-50 gas puriﬁcation system philosophy was based on the eﬃcient removal of cold gas from
the ullage and puriﬁcation of this gas using a getter system. Clean LAr is then returned to the detector after
puriﬁcation and condensing of the GAr. Outgassing from TPC materials is minimal once the surfaces are
cooled to LAr temperature. Hence, after an initial cleanup, the steady-state source of argon contamination
is mostly the warm areas of the detector. In DarkSide-50, the cryostat design kept both the LAr and the
GAr in the ullage cold, and this will be duplicated in DarkSide-20k since it was proven to be extremely
eﬀective. However, due to the large total argon mass of DarkSide-20k, if initial purity is low, puriﬁcation

using only the ullage gas withdraw may take too long to achieve the required purity. Therefore, the plan is
to maintain the DarkSide-50 philosophy, but in addition add a fast liquid withdraw point from the bottom
of the cryostat. Once the system purity reaches the design value, the LAr withdraw can be either reduced
or stopped, while the gas would continue to recirculate and continuously purify the argon coming from the
detector ullage.

The GAr recirculation from the DarkSide-20k cryostat ullage will be realized as was done for DarkSide-50.
The gas ﬂow from the ullage will have a maximum rate of 350 std L/min, almost entirely boiled oﬀ by the
1.5 kW heat load resulting from the combination of the cryostat heat leak and the power dissipated by the
cold electronics inside the LAr TPC. This gas ﬂow is pumped out along the paths of the detector cables
in order to ﬂush out all possible outgassing from the cables. The gas is then pushed through the getter for
puriﬁcation followed by the condenser where it is re-liquiﬁed before returning to the detector. The cabling
routes and gas circulation route, as well as the gas route tubing size, are carefully designed so that at the
minimum circulation speed all outgassing of any warm part will still be ﬂushed out. The minimum ﬂow speed
will be larger than the back diﬀusion speed.

In order to reach the minimum electron lifetime goal (5 ms) in a reasonable time after the detector has
been ﬁlled (about one month), the total combined puriﬁcation speed is designed to be 1000 std L/min. The
cryogenics system will use a set of heat exchangers to form a high eﬃciency heat recovery system to boil oﬀ
LAr being drawn out of the bottom of the cryostat using heat from the clean warm GAr, at the same time
cooling the incoming GAr as it heads towards the condenser. So, in addition to the GAr being drawn from
the top of the detector as is done in DarkSide-50, at the same time LAr will also be pumped from the bottom
of the cryostat, boiled oﬀ using clean warm GAr ﬂowing toward the cryostat, and then joined with the GAr

26

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

coming from the top of the cryostat to continue through the puriﬁcation system, eventually all returning to
the cryostat as LAr.

Recent detailed studies and lab tests show that an eﬃcient approach to pumping the argon could be to
realize a high-ﬂow-rate QDrive gas pump, as shown in Fig. 9. The QDrive pump pulls the LAr from the
bottom of the cryostat up to the bottom of the heat exchangers from the detector, while at the same time
creating higher pressure on the return side of the heat exchangers. The gas circulation system is driven by
two QDrive pumps (variable speed up to 500 std L/min each, see Fig. 9). The QDrive pumps, custom-built
in cooperation with QDrive, Inc., are magnetically driven resonance pumps. A smaller version of such pump
is being used in DarkSide-50’s 50 std L/min gas system. The QDrive pump is sealed within a stainless steel
body and hence is intrinsically safe against loss of the valuable UAr in case of an operational failure. The
QDrive pump uses a set of long-life reed valves and a spring loaded piston moving in resonance mode, making
it intrinsically wear free and maintenance free. Two such pumps will be operated in parallel to achieve the
required 1000 std L/min ﬂow, with only one needed at a lower ﬂow rate. A third pump will be built as a
spare. With the QDrive pumps, GAr streaming from the ullage and liquid from the detector bottom are
pumped and joined together in the heat exchanger system between H2D and H1D in Fig. 9. A mass ﬂow
controller maintains the balance of the two ﬂow streams.

The maximum height that the pump should push the LAr up to is determined to be 1.5 m, to avoid a
vapor pressure drop at the outgoing side of H1D to near the triple point of argon. This means that H1D must
be no more than 1.5 m above the LAr pump. A dedicated test is planned to conﬁrm the argon head height.
This important parameter will be used to determine the location (vertical elevation) of H1D and hence the
rest of the cryogenics system.

The diﬀerential pressure between incoming warm GAr and the outgoing cold argon provide the ideal
heat exchange condition in the heat exchanger stages H2D, H3D, and H4D, to achieve better than 95 %
heat recovery eﬃciency. The chilled incoming cold GAr is then liqueﬁed by the outgoing LAr in H1D. This
approach recovers most of the LAr enthalpy and can be operated in a very stable condition thanks to the
naturally self-balancing heat loads applied on the two counter-current streams. The total LAr withdrawal
is only about 1 L/min in order to provide the required 650 std L/min gas ﬂow needed for an initial fast and
eﬃcient cleanup of the LAr.

An important feature of the cryogenics system design is its ﬂexibility. Once the desired purity is reached
during the commissioning phase, it will be possible to turn oﬀ or to reduce the total cooling power to the
minimum amount required for the operation of the detector with its anticipated 350 std L/min GAr ﬂow.
The enthalpy contained in the ullage gas is also recovered in the high-eﬃciency heat exchangers H2D, H3D,
and H4D, resulting in a requirement of 1.5 kW for the argon condenser to balance the cryostat heat leak and
the power dissipated by the cold electronics inside the LAr TPC.

As previously mentioned, cold GAr is pumped from the top ullage of the cryostat and into the heat
exchanger just before H2D. Room temperature GAr exiting the heat exchanger will then be pumped through
the Zr-based hot getter puriﬁer and then returned to the heat exchanger. From there, the returning warm
argon will then be cooled in the tri-media heat exchanger by the outgoing cold GAr and the outgoing N2
boiled oﬀ from the condenser. This gas reaches near LAr temperature before entering the radon trap. Further,
the cold GAr will be mostly liqueﬁed in H1D by the outgoing LAr. The argon condenser then liqueﬁes any
residual GAr, and the fully liqueﬁed argon will be returned to the TPC using a long vacuum-insulated
transfer line that will pass through the WCV and LSV.

The puriﬁcation of argon will happen only in the gas phase. No liquid puriﬁcation is being considered: the
experience of WARP, ICARUS, and MicroBOONE has shown that resins and adsorbers in use for liquid phase
puriﬁcations source enormous amounts of radon into the system. The experience with noble liquid TPCs such
as XENON, DarkSide, and LUX shows that hot zirconium-based getters from SAES are the best solution
on the market to remove the major sources of chemical contamination (O2, CO2, H2O, N2). These getters
typically require an inlet purity at the ppm level and guarantee an outlet purity at the ppb level. Since they
work in a closed loop on a deﬁnite batch of noble liquid, they eventually can reach purities in the ppt level.
For the ﬂow rate necessary for the recirculation system, a commercial unit from SAES satisfying the required
needs has already been identiﬁed . The active puriﬁcation element is a large, replaceable zirconium cartridge.
There are no consequences to the cryogenics system due to the need of operating the purifying cartridge at
high temperature since the getter is engineered by SAES to take care of the required thermalization and
to return the gas at room temperature. There is no single point outside the getters own enclosure which is
operated at high temperature. In the course of the experimentation with the DarkSide-50 system, signiﬁcant
experience with these units was gained, including the construction and commissioning of a custom-built set
of high capacity cartridges for the puriﬁcation of the UAr as it was injected into the DarkSide-50 cryostat.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

27

The experience with DarkSide-50 was very positive and successful, and the UAr immediately obtained a
purity corresponding to an equivalent electron lifetime >5 ms, at the completion of ﬁll.

The radon trap is a volume ﬁlled with activated synthetic charcoal which the clean argon from the getter
must pass through, prior to returning to the detector. Radon originating from any warm surfaces of the
cables or the gas handling system will be eﬃciently removed by the radon trap. The location of the radon
trap, right above the H5D heat exchanger, allows the cold GAr to be the cooling source of the trap. Once
in thermal equilibrium with the temperature achieved at the point between H2D and H5D (near the LAr
temperature independent of the actual argon ﬂow rate) the activated charcoal radon trap is eﬀectively 100 %
eﬃcient, meaning no detectable radon makes its way passed the radon trap [108]. The key to the radon
trap design is its operation in a range of temperature just above the argon liquefaction temperature. With a
2 µBq/kg contamination (easily achieved in DarkSide-50) the physics goals of DarkSide-20k are achievable.
A feature identical to the one used in the DarkSide-50 gas system is the 83mKr source insertion system,
which is integrated directly into the gas panel. An adjustable percentage of the ﬂow of the recirculating GAr
can be sent through a 83mKr source to provide a temporary distributed calibration signal in the TPC. Again
as in DarkSide-50, the 83mKr will pass through the radon trap. To make sure the krypton will pass through
the trap before decaying, the radon trap will be designed to handle the large ﬂow by increasing its cross
section but not the argon path length, compared to that of DarkSide-50. LAr should be avoided in the radon
trap, so a bypass is added to adjust the amount of N2 ﬂow into the heat exchangers H2D, H3D, and H4D.
The cold source of the entire system is provided by LN2. The LN2 cooling loop is a closed system that
consists of a 30 t LN2 source supply tank outside Hall C, a local reserve tank capable of storing 3 days worth
of cooling power in emergency mode, a LN2/argon condenser, and a set of heat exchangers to recycle the
spent N2 cold gas to pre-cool the incoming argon. The spent N2 gas is then returned to the LN2 recycling
system and the re-liqueﬁed LN2 returned to the large source tank, see Sec. 15.2.

5.3 Pressure Balance in the Heat Exchangers

The pressure at a few critical locations must be carefully balanced in order to achieve heat exchanger
eﬃciency better than 95 %. The detector cryostat working pressure is set at 1.075 bar (15.6 psi) so that LAr
can be pumped to reach and enter H1D of the multi stage heat exchanger. The LAr head pressure is reduced
to 0.8 bar (see Fig. 9) at that point. The argon then passes through the three tri-media heat exchanger
stages labelled as H2D, H3D, and H4D as it is brought up to room temperature. The output gas of the
H4D is at room temperature as it then enters the input of QDrive pumps. The QDrive pumps increase the
pressure to 2.5 bar as the gas is pumped to the getter puriﬁer. After passing through the getter puriﬁer at
room temperature, the return gas goes back into the H4D exchanger at 2.0 bar pressure (reduced by the
ﬂow resistance of the getter puriﬁer) where it begins to be cooled down. By the time the argon exits the
cold output of the H1D heat exchanger it has been partially re-liqueﬁed. The liquid/gas mixture then passes
through a cryogenic regulator where the pressure is reduced to 1.2 bar. The mixture then travels to the
condenser where it is completely condensed into liquid and then sent to the detector. The cold GAr coming
from the detector or from the recovery system that is to be puriﬁed is injected into the gas stream between
H1D and H2D of the multi stage heat exchanger. The design of the four stage heat exchanger is better than
95 % eﬃcient.

5.4 Condensers

The LAr condenser is the key part of the cryogenics system. A safe, reliable and performance ﬂexible
condenser is critical to the success of the experiment. The condenser, with 100 % stainless steel construction,
is a much improved version of the condenser used for the DarkSide-50 cryogenics system [70]. The condenser
design is shown in Fig. 10. There will be three condensers in the cryogenics system, one for the detector and
one each for the two recovery systems. One of these condensers has already been completely fabricated at
UCLA, and is currently being prepared for initial testing.

The main heat exchange surfaces are composed of the walls of many short stainless steel tubes. There are
a total of 61 0.5 (cid:48)(cid:48) diameter tubes of two diﬀerent lengths, 5 (cid:48)(cid:48) and 3 (cid:48)(cid:48), with their tops blinded. The bottoms
of these tubes are welded onto a three-step holder. Above the holder and outside the tubes (N2 volume)
is ﬁlled with LN2 at a level that depends on the cooling power requirement, while the volume below the
holder and inside the tubes (argon volume), isolated from the LN2 section, is ﬁlled with incoming GAr to be
liqueﬁed. The heat exchange between the GAr and LN2 is done through the 0.035 (cid:48)(cid:48) thick walls of the 0.5 (cid:48)(cid:48)

diameter tubes The size, spacing and number of tubes was derived from experience, detailed multi-physics
simulations and laboratory tests. The maximum heat exchange would occur when the N2 volume is ﬁlled
with LN2 and has been designed to be approximately 5 kW.

LN2 is fed into the condenser through a half-inch line that ends in a feature called the “chicken feeder”
and controls the ﬂow of LN2 into the volume automatically by the pressure balance. The chicken feeder does
not allow gas to ﬂow back into the liquid supply line which provides ﬂow stability. A mass ﬂow controller
is used on the LN2 vent line to control the outgoing ﬂow of the boiled-oﬀ N2, which is proportional to
the cooling power of the condenser. By controlling the N2 ﬂow the cooling power is precisely controlled, as
successfully done in DarkSide-50 where a detector gas pressure stability of 0.023 psi (RMS) was achieved.
The more LN2 that ﬁlls the condenser, the more surface area of the tubes that are in contact with the LN2,
which increases the cooling capacity. The LN2 level in the condenser volume is automatically balanced once
the outgoing ﬂow (hence cooling power) is set. The LN2 feed line pressure to the condenser is controlled by
the back pressure regulator (located after the LN2 supply vessel) which keeps the pressure at 1 bar.

The GAr is fed to the lower part of the condenser from the side (see Fig. 10) and condenses as it comes
in contact with the tube array. The liquid then drops down to the bottom of the condenser and ﬂows into
a vacuum-insulated transfer line that transports the liquid to the detector. Once LAr drops down from the
bottom of the half inch tubes, the cooling to this element of LAr stops, preventing further cooling. The choice
of the length of the half inch tube, and hence the time in contact with the cold stainless steel surface, is
critical to avoid over-cooling by the much colder LN2. As LAr drops away, it is quickly replaced with incoming
GAr, which continuously sends heat through the wall to the LN2 side. On the LN2 side, the spaces between
the tubes are carefully determined such that the boil oﬀ gas is constrained and pushes away LN2, so the
surface of the tube is not covered by LN2 100 % of the time. This design, combining the above considerations,
eliminates the need for temperature balancing using high pressure LN2 to match the argon temperature. The
cooling power of the condenser is variable from zero up to the full power by simply controlling the boil-oﬀ
N2 gas ﬂow rate which is proportional to the latent heat of the LN2 and hence the cooling power. This ﬂow
rate is controlled using the information from the detector pressure feedback.

5.5 Low Background Cryostat

The conceptual design of the DarkSide-20k cryostat, as shown in Fig. 11, follows closely that of the successful
DarkSide-50 cryostat: a 4π vacuum-insulated vessel made of three separate parts, the top assembly, the inner
cryostat vessel, and the vacuum insulation vessel. The top assembly is formed by an outer dome and an inner
dome mechanically linked with solid low-thermal-conduction rods. The outer dome of the top assembly has a
ﬂange that matches the insulation vessel ﬂange and uses a metal o-ring as the vacuum seal. The inner dome
has a ﬂange that matches the inner cryostat vessel and uses a V-groove indium wire seal.

Fig. 11. 3D rendering of the DarkSide-20k cryostat.

Due to the large size of the two vessels, their lateral walls are reinforced by a number of strengthening
ribs. Thermo-mechanical ﬁnite element analysis is ongoing to ﬁnalize the strengthening elements design. The
inner vessel strengthening ribs are placed outside of itself, while for the insulation vessel they are placed
inside (both inside the insulating vacuum volume). With the cryostat and the insulation vessel ribs designed
to be oﬀset vertically when the vessels are in their ﬁnal positions, the multi-layered super-insulation placed
in between blocks all lines of sight for thermal radiation.

The cryostat port designation and locations will also follow the design used in DarkSide-50. The ports
for various services penetrating the two top domes use bellows links to eliminate mechanical stress due to
thermal loads. The services include all signal readouts for light sensors, instrumentation control cables, GAr
puriﬁcation recirculation ports, and the clean LAr return port. Both the gas-out and liquid-in ports are
double-wall bayonets, to avoid thermal loss. Unlike in DarkSide-50, at the bottom of the cryostat there is a
LAr fast-drain port, which is a specially designed bayonet assembly connecting to both the inner vessel and
the outer insulation vessel.

TPC mounting anchor points are integrated into the ﬂange of the inner dome so that the TPC can
be mounted easily before the vessels are closed. The detector leveling will be done similarly to that of
DarkSide-50, by adjusting the level of the cryostat. The leveling system will be integrated into the anchor
points on the cryostat support structure.

The DarkSide-50 cryostat was made of stainless steel selected to have low levels of trace radioactivity
(<1 mBq/kg of 238U and 232Th), and the baseline design of the DarkSide-20k cryostat assumes the same
material, which gives input for the activity of the cryostat in the MC simulations.

It is known from commercial use that titanium alloys have properties suﬃcient for cryogenic use and
so there is no need to develop a special group of alloys for cryogenic applications, if the conditions in
Table 4 are taken into account and the gas composition impurities are kept below (wt. %); O2:0.10; N2:0.03;
H2:undetectable; C:0.08 [109].

The LUX collaboration has pioneered the use of titanium in low-background applications [110], and recent
results of experimental studies performed within the DarkSide Collaboration have shown great promise in

establishing titanium as a low-background structural material: a titanium cryostat is a possible alternative
to the baseline option of a stainless steel cryostat. Titanium’s higher strength-to-mass ratio means that for
the same speciﬁc activity, titanium will give a lower gamma background contribution than stainless steel.
However, titanium has a higher (α,n) neutron yield, resulting in about the same neutron production rate for
structures made of titanium or stainless-steel with the same speciﬁc activity. This sets a goal of using titanium
with <1 mBq/kg of total activity, and if unachievable, stainless steel with the lowest possible activity (and
at least as good as was accomplished in DarkSide-50) should be used (assuming the cryostat masses given
in Table 13).

Initial investigations by members of the DarkSide Collaboration of radioactive contaminants in samples
of rolled titanium and titanium-containing products were carried out during 2012 and 2013. A new approach
was proposed during 2014 and 2015 based on industrial processes implemented at the Solikamsk Magnesium
Plant in Russia to manufacture titanium sponge. Research results showed that the widely used Kroll process
can be modiﬁed to produce titanium sponge with a predictable 238U and 232Th activity <1 mBq/kg.

First tests suggest that the ultra-low radioactivity (ULR) titanium sponge can be converted into metal
sheets with properties equal to VT-1-0 grade industrial construction material, while maintaining the original
radioactive purity. A plan to make industrial scale volumes of the ULR titanium from raw material includes
the following steps:
1. Production of ULR titanium sponge;
2. Crushing sponge with further magnet separation;
3. Isostatic compacting of the sponge;
4. Vacuum arc-melting or electron-beam melting with special attention paid to recontamination, producing

cylindrical and rectangular ingots (120 mm diameter and up to 2 m long);

5. Cutting long semi-industrial ingots to pieces 0.7 m long;
6. Rolling with annealing, leading to the production of sheets and massive titanium rods with optimal

mechanical properties and low deformation for large ﬂanges;

7. Laser welding.

Fig. 12 shows samples of the ULR titanium at diﬀerent stages in this production process.
The procedure resulted in samples of ULR material with mechanical strength better than industrial
titanium and close to the mechanical properties of stainless steel grade 12X18N10, usually used for low
temperature applications. In fact, one of the samples produced out performed titanium alloy VT-1-0, giving
uranium and thorium upper limits of <3.8 × 10−2 mBq/kg and <2.0 × 10−1 mBq/kg respectively.

Since it is certain that stainless steel complying with the background requirements can be obtained, this
is taken as the baseline material to be used for the DarkSide-20k cryostat. However, to reduce the mass of
the cryostat, and to be able to provide a structural material with known, low, and controlled radioactive
contaminants, the production of ULR titanium is actively being pursued by the DarkSide Collaboration.
After performing key mechanical tests at room and LAr temperatures, radiopurity screening to assess the
ﬁnal radioactivity of the building material, and computer simulations of a titanium cryostat design for
structural integrity and neutron production, a ﬁnal decision of whether or not this ULR titanium can be
used for the DarkSide-20k cryostat will be made.

separated crushed sponge; 3. isostatic compacted sponge; 4. vacuum arc-welded (cylinder) and electron-beam melted
(rectangular block) ingots; and 5. samples for mechanical tests.

5.6 Argon Storage and Recovery System

DarkSide-20k will be equipped with a zero boil-oﬀ recovery and storage system (Recovery I), capable of
recovering and storing the total inventory of LAr (see Fig. 13). Because of the value of the LAr, a second
recovery system labeled Recovery II is in a constant cold standby condition ready to back up Recovery I
and/or the detector. Each recovery system is equipped with independent active cooling, capable of handling
the full inventory of argon. Recovery System I will be used when there is a need to empty the detector. Each
recovery system is capable of the rapid transfer of LAr from the detector, simply driven by gravity, in case of
unforeseen problems. The system will also allow recovery of the LAr target for possible scheduled procedures,
such as upgrades of the inner detector or maintenance interventions on the cooling loop. The recovery system
will allow the cryogenics system to circulate argon and purify the LAr while the full inventory is stored in the
recovery cryostat. Another set of heat exchangers are placed at 1.5 m above the recovery tanks, performing
a similar function as the heat exchangers in the gas system described above. The clean warm gas is then
returned through the same heat exchanger to the recovery tank. The designed overall gas ﬂow rate in the
recovery system is also 1000 std L/min, with the heat exchanging eﬃciency conservatively expected to be on
the order of 95 %. Therefore, the total cooling power required for operation is the power needed to condense
5 % of the overall gas ﬂow rate, or 0.4 kW, and from a heat load expected to be similar to that of the detector
cryogenics system (150 W). An argon/LN2 condenser, identical to that of the detector will be installed on
each of the recovery systems.

When the argon ﬁrst arrives at LNGS and is fed into the cryogenics system, it will undergo a quality
check by passing through a purity monitor that will check the electron drift lifetime. This test is an eﬀective
way of verifying the purity of the LAr. As the test is taking place, the gas and LAr will be collected in
Recovery II isolating it from the main inventory of stored LAr. Once the content of a batch of argon has
been tested and found to be acceptable, the argon will be transferred to Recovery I where it will be stored
long-term.

While the liquid is being stored in Recovery I, it can be further puriﬁed by circulating the argon through
the getter puriﬁer system as discussed above. Both liquid and gas in Recovery I or Recovery II can be puriﬁed
simultaneously. In the event that argon is found not to have high purity, as found by the purity monitor test,
it can be puriﬁed while the argon is isolated in Recovery II. Once the argon has reached an acceptable level
of purity it can be transferred to Recovery I.

Each recovery system has an independent insulating vacuum system and a LN2 condenser for cooling. If
a problem arises with one of the recovery systems, the argon can be transferred to the other recovery system.
Each recovery system, as well as the detector, has as a simple standalone control system that can override
the main control system in the event of an overpressure condition. When an overpressure condition occurs,
the assumption is made that there is a problem with the main control system and local control takes over.
In this condition, the override control system only cools the volume liquid to a default temperature. If the
detector pressure does not drop, a transfer of gas will take place by venting the detector to Recovery I where
it will be condensed. This will take place below the pressure limit of the rupture disks. At that point, the
situation would be inspected and a decision would be made if the problem was serious of whether or not to
transfer the liquid from the detector to the Recovery System.

5.7 Additional System Considerations

Fig. 13. 3D rendering of the DarkSide-20k LAr recovery tank.

Power Dissipation: It is inferred from Ref. [111] that convection in free LAr is able to carry away up to
20 mW/(cm2 (meter of LAr depth)) before the onset of bubbling. The maximum heat that can be withstood
before the onset of boiling of the LAr at the bottom of the cryostat is therefore about 60 mW/cm2, for a
total maximum heat load of >5 kW.

Cleaning and Handling: All of the cryogenic components are fabricated from stainless steel. All sur-
faces in contact with LAr or GAr will be electropolished and cleaned with DarkSide standard cleaning
procedures either done in house or externally by a selected trusted vendor(s). All piping will be ﬂushed with
dry N2 gas to avoid dusts. Before assembly, all stainless steel surfaces will be visually inspected for quality
control. The cleaning applies to all surfaces of the cryogenics system, with all materials being handled in a
standard clean room environment.

Thermal Insulation: All cryogenic volumes will be thermally insulated with super-insulation combined
with vacuum better than 1 × 10−5 mbar. Dry foreline pumps will be use throughout the system combined
with turbomolecular pumps. All cryogenic surfaces will be covered with multi-layer-insulation blanket which
will consist of 20+ layers of radiation reﬂector ﬁlm separated with perforated spacer sheets. The radiation
barrier is made of polyimide and/or polyester ﬁlms that are vapor deposited with 99.99 % aluminum on both
sides.

Welding Speciﬁcations: Where applicable, welding shall be performed in accordance with all applica-
ble codes such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section IX and AWS D1.6. After a tube has
been welded, the weld shall be cleaned with a stainless steel brush to remove all weld oxidation. Pickling
and/or passivation are required for all welded surfaces and near welded areas. All welding shall be done by
using non-thoriated tungsten electrodes. All welds shall be internally purged with 100 % argon. All welds
will be inspected by a qualiﬁed weld inspector and documented.

Leak Detection Requirements: All welds and joints will be leak tested with a helium leak detector

with a sensitivity of 2 × 10−9 std cm3/s. No leak larger that 2 × 10−9 std cm3/s is permitted.

Pressure Testing: All fabricated components such as the charcoal trap vessel, the heat exchanger, the
condenser vessel and the piping shall be pressure tested according to the requirements of ASME Section
VIII. Pneumatic testing with dry nitrogen gas is admissible.

5.8 System Safety Considerations

5.8.1 Power Outages

It is critical to keep the entire LAr inventory safe. Extensive tests performed with the DarkSide-50 system
provided the basis for the DarkSide-20k design. A set of critical valves are arranged to be at the proper
locations to serve as emergency pressure relief for the system. When total loss of power including the UPS
system occurs, these valves should be held open to provide continuous cooling and venting of the LN2. The
local LN2 reserve will be guided through the condenser to provide the required cooling to maintain a safe
system. These features have been realized in the DarkSide-50 cryogenics system and tested extensively prior
to the LAr ﬁll. In the case of total electrical power loss, the LN2 loop will automatically become an open
loop, while all active sources of heat inside the cryostat (mainly the cold electronics) will be shut oﬀ: the
only substantial passive source of heat remaining is the 150 W cryostat heat leak. As already proven with the
DarkSide-50 cryogenics system, the LN2 reserve maintained at near full level, combined with the carefully
designed pneumatic valve conﬁguration, is immune to complete power failure, including the loss of the UPS
system control power. In this situation, the 250 L of LN2 stored in the LN2 tank will be enough to maintain
the detector in a stable and unperturbed condition, for about 3 days. In addition, the large LN2 source tank
is also linked to the local storage for extended cooling should the emergency situation continue for more than
a few days.

5.8.2 Pressure Relief

There are three volumes that have the ability to store the full inventory of LAr (Recovery I, Recovery II,
and the detector cryostat). Each is protected by a rupture disk relief assembly, as shown in Fig. 14. The
rupture disks are a welded all-metal design that eliminates the possibility of permeation contamination into
the system. Each rupture disk has a pressure rupture limit of 1.7 bar. Each rupture disk is in series with a
certiﬁed spring loaded o-ring sealed pressure relief valve located downstream of the rupture disk that is set
for 1.6 bar. In the event that a rupture disk bursts, the spring loaded relief valve will only allow enough gas to
vent to lower the pressure to a safe condition and will minimize the gas loss. There is a pressure transducer
located between these two reliefs that is continuously monitored by the slow control system for any change
more than 0.1 bar. If the pressure between the relief valves exceeds the set pressure limit, the rupture disk
is considered to be leaking and will be replaced. Every rupture disk has an online backup in the event that
a rupture takes place or is found to have a leak. In the event of a failure the spare will be brought on line
by means of repositioning a 3-way hand valve. This hand valve will be locked in the primary rupture disk
position and will need to be unlocked to bring the backup rupture disk online. The 3-way valve does not
have an oﬀ position (at least one rupture disk is always linked to the system), it is only used to choose which
rupture disk is in use. There is a pump out port allowing the evacuation between the rupture disk and the
3-way valve to perform the clean replacement of a new rupture disk.

Fig. 14. Schematic of the DarkSide-20k cryogenics rupture disk relief assembly.

There are many cold spaces between control valves that can be potentially trap volumes if the associated
valves are closed. As the liquid or gas warms up the pressure within the conﬁned space can potentially exceed
the pressure ratings. In these spaces small spring loaded reliefs are installed that have a pressure setting of
10 bar. These valves have the potential of venting a signiﬁcant amount of gas. The output of all of these

6 PhotoElectronics

6.1 Introduction

Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are one of the key enabling technologies for large-scale LAr-based dark
matter experiments. SiPMs may also play an important role in the next generation of LAr-based neutrino
detectors, such as DUNE [112], and liquid xenon based detectors for neutrinoless double beta decay, such
as nEXO [113]. SiPMs have a number of performance advantages over traditional PMTs, including higher
photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) and much better single-photon resolution, all while operating at much
lower bias voltage. SiPMs can also be eﬃciently integrated into tiles that cover large areas and feature better
radio purity than PMTs.

The DarkSide Collaboration committed to building the next detectors of its dark matter research pro-
grams with SiPM-based photosensors. For DarkSide-20k, the photosensing unit will be a “photodetector
module” (PDM), consisting of a large tile of SiPMs covering an area of 50 × 50 mm2 operating as a single de-
tector. Besides the tile, each module will also contain a cryogenic preampliﬁer, which will amplify and shape
the signal in the immediate proximity of the sensor. The output of the cryogenic ampliﬁer will be passed on
to a signal transmitter, also integrated into the PDM, and responsible for transmission of the signal through
the cryostat penetration. Finally, the PDM will also include the mechanical structure required to assemble
all components and to eﬃciently dissipate heat in the LAr target, minimizing the production of bubbles. An
intelligent power distribution system is also foreseen, capable of disabling individual PDMs in case of failure.
The PDMs are located above the anode and below the cathode and fully cover the top and bottom faces
of the LAr TPC active volume, to detect both the S1 and S2 signals with high eﬃciency. The top and the
bottom photon readout assemblies consist of 2605 PDMs, each. Multiple PDMs are mounted to a single
motherboard to form two larger basic mechanical units called the square board (SQB) and the triangular
board (TRB), as shown in Fig. 15. The SQB and TRB have the same edge size of 25 cm. The SQB and TRB
are then used to form the full readout planes (shown in Fig. 48). The total number of readout channels (top
and bottom) is 5210.

An important aspect to be considered when reading out large SiPMs tiles is the high output capacitance
(compared to PMTs), which is of the order of 50 pF/mm2. This imposes a careful design of the read-out
electronics and SiPMs connection scheme on the tile. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is deﬁned as the ratio of
the mean value of the integrated single photoelectron (SPE) response to the RMS of the integrated baseline.
The ﬁgure of merit of the entire system is the maximum tile area that can be operated as a single PDM,
connected to a single electronic channel, without deteriorating the signal to noise ratio. The requirement for
this ﬁgure of merit is given in the next section.

The requirements for the individual PDMs are:
PDM-i PDM area covering a 50 × 50 mm2 surface. This allows for the total number of channels to stay

within 5210;

PDM-ii Overall photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) larger than 40 % at 420 nm. This is of primary
importance for the light yield as the increased PDE, along with the increase in eﬀective photocathode
coverage of the top and bottom of the TPC to >85 % (80 % in DarkSide-50), will provide a signiﬁcant

improvement over the Hamamatsu R11065 PMTs used in DarkSide-50 and have a QE of 34 %. It is then
required that the inactive gap between SiPMs be smaller than 100 µm and have a tile-level ﬁll factor larger
than 90 % to meet the active area requirement;

PDM-iii Power dissipation density limited to 100 µW/mm2, corresponding to a total dissipated power
of 250 mW per PDM. This allows for the use of up to four pre-ampliﬁers (40 mW each) and two diﬀerential
transmitters (20 mW each) per PDM, while avoiding excessive heat load on the cryogenic system;

PDM-iv Dynamic range higher than 50 PE detected simultaneously, without aﬀecting the SNR provided

by the pre-ampliﬁer. Lower values would aﬀect the reconstruction of S2;

PDM-v Time resolution for the ﬁrst hit on each PDM on the order of 10 ns. Experience with DarkSide-50

and MC simulations have shown that this is crucial to maintain a very eﬀective PSD for the LAr TPC.

PDM-vi Overall noise rate below 0.1 Hz/mm2, this includes the dark count rate (DCR) from the photo
detectors and the fake pulses generated by electronic noise (plus possibly correlated noise injected in the
system by external sources), both of which should be signiﬁcantly below the mentioned rate. Higher rates
would impact both the trigger eﬃciency and the pulse shape discrimination power.

The last requirement sets very stringent limits on the SNR levels, the discussion of which is a crucial part
of this section. Setting a charge threshold that gives a large single PE eﬃciency, while keeping the overall
noise rate within the level indicated in PDM-vi, requires an excellent SNR. Using a detailed simulation,
constrained by real data, it was found that to obtain a 95 % single PE eﬃciency, while keeping the electronic
noise at a few percent of the SiPM noise (see PDM-vi), requires a SNR >7.

The goal is to build and operate 5210 PDMs, each as a single analog element, whose output signal is
digitized by the readout electronics. As discussed in this section, work is being done to reach this objective
in steps. To date, tiles with an area of 20 × 20 mm2 and 50 × 50 mm2 have been built and successfully
operated. The results described here are for the 20 × 20 mm2 tile, which meets the speciﬁcations. Based on
the preliminary results obtained with a 50 × 50 mm2 tile, the ﬁnal goal of meeting all the PDM requirements
could be achieved and have ﬁrst been reported in [114].

6.2 SiPMs Speciﬁcations

Given the fact that the discrete electrical unit in will be the PDM, SiPM speciﬁcations must ensure that
each PDM will reach the stringent requirements (i to vi) set forth by the DarkSide Collaboration in the
previous section. A list of preliminary, minimal SiPM requirements for operation at 87 K is:

SiPM-i PDE equal to or greater than 45 % at 420 nm, set by the amount required to oﬀset the inactive

gaps in the PDM tile and the ineﬃciency of the hit detection, so that requirement PDM-i is met;

SiPM-ii Individual SiPM size larger than 5 × 5 mm2 to ease the assembly of SiPMs into tiles. Ideal sizes

would be 1 cm2;

SiPM-iii DCR lower than 0.1 Hz/mm2, as per requirement PDM-vi;
SiPM-iv Total Correlated Noise Probability (TCNP), crosstalk (CT) + afterpulsing (AP), lower than
60 %. While the eﬀects of total correlated noise on S1 (energy and PSD) can be minimized during the analysis,
a high value for TCNP can aﬀect the dynamic range available for S2;

SiPM-v Eﬀective output capacitance lower than 50 pF/mm2, in the frequency range of interest. Higher

values would negatively impact the SNR.

6.3 The Development of SiPMs at FBK

Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) has developed two main SiPM technologies with high density (suﬃx “-HD”)
single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) that are sensitive to UV light:

NUV-HD-SF: A family with peak eﬃciency in the near ultra-violet (410 nm) and standard electric ﬁeld

conﬁguration [115];

NUV-HD-LF: A family with peak eﬃciency in the near ultra-violet (410 nm) and low electric ﬁeld

conﬁguration [116];

Table 5 summarizes the features of the SiPMs of the two families with the standard 25 µm cell size, at
300 K and at 77 K. Other cell sizes have been produced at FBK with NUV-HD technology, ranging between
20 µm and 40 µm. They may be considered and tested in order to optimize detector performance. When
bringing the SiPMs from 300 K to 77 K, the most dramatic changes in the SiPMs characteristics occur in
the breakdown voltage, in the DCR, and the after=pulsing (AP) rate. The quenching resistor Rq is made of
polysilicon, with a resistance that depends on temperature. By tuning the doping parameters of polysilicon,

resistors Rq whose resistance changes by a factor from 2 to 20, passing from 300 K to 77 K, have been
successfully manufactured. Typically, Rq increases with decreasing temperature, causing an increase in the
SPAD recharge time and, correspondingly, in the duration of the pulse. For all SiPMs, the choice of the value
of Rq is fundamental as this inﬂuences the recharge time of the SPADs. SiPMs with a recharge time at 77 K
in the range up to a few hundreds of ns are identiﬁed with the standard name NUV-HD-LF, and SiPMs with
a recharge time at 77 K in the range of a few µs with the suﬃx “-HRq”, hence NUV-HD-LF-HRq.

A long recharge time, as provided by the HRq technology, oﬀers signiﬁcant advantages: strong suppression
of the AP, higher PDE (thanks to the higher applicable over-voltage (OV)), and better reproducibility of the
devices (thanks to the suppression of AP). On the other hand, the main drawback is that the signal charge
is delivered during a longer time and, correspondingly, the tail of the single SPAD response (SCR) shows a
decrease in its maximum amplitude. Fig. 16 shows the change in the SCR in the range 40 K to 300 K, for a
particular set of NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPMs with Rq starting at 2 MΩ at 300 K and increasing up to 40 MΩ as
the temperature was lowered to 77 K. There is a fast component that is almost constant with temperature
(which accounts for about 10% of the total charge), while the pulse tail becomes longer and longer with
decreasing temperature (as does the recharge time). As a result, the SPAD recovery (recharge) time becomes
quite long, 2.5 µs.

The NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPM is the FBK technology with the best performance which meets all of the
requirements. In particular, at 77 K, operation at 5 V overvoltage (OV) or greater allows to meet both
the PDE (with the hypothesis that the PDE at 420 nmdoes not change with temperature) and the DCR
requirements. The PDE of the NUV-HD-LF-HRq is quite high and exceeds the design requirements by a
signiﬁcant amount, as shown in Fig. 17. The DCR is more than one order of magnitude lower than the
requirement. The study of the NUV-HD-LF DCR as a function of OV at 77 K, seen in Fig. 18, shows an
exponential growth of DCR vs. OV, which is typical of tunneling, the dominant carrier generation mechanism
at this temperature. The DCR remains below 1 × 10−2 Hz/mm2 at 6 V OV.

To conﬁrm the results of the ﬁrst NUV-HD-LF prototypes, and to perform a speciﬁc evaluation, a
dedicated NUV-HD-LF wafer lot was produced at FBK, manufacturing two SiPM sizes, 5 × 5 mm2 and
10 × 10 mm2, with diﬀerent polysilicon quenching resistors, in order to tune the value at 77 K and check the
diﬀerence in performance. The ﬁrst functional tests on 10 × 10 mm2 with high Rq conﬁrm the excellent per-
formance of this technology. Fig. 19 shows a persistence plot measured with a 10 × 10 mm2 NUV-HD-LF-HRq
SiPM, operated at 4 V OV. The measurement was performed at FBK, by immersing the SiPM in LN2 and
using a non-cryogenic ampliﬁer placed in close proximity and containing a 160 mW power consumption. To
improve SNR, a quasi-optimal ﬁlter is used, composed of a single, real pole low-pass with a time constant of
400 ns (the SiPM microcell recharge time constant was 300 ns). The resulting SNRAmplitude was 14. Fig. 19
also shows very good microcell gain uniformity over the 10 × 10 mm2 area, which contains approximately
160 × 103 individual SPADs.

In parallel with the basic functional characterization, statistical tests on yield and reliability have started
at the wafer level. At FBK, full wafer testing in the range from 233 K to 300 K was performed, thanks to an
automatic prober that can cool the chuck holding the wafer. As an example, Fig. 20 shows the reverse IV

233 K. The breakdown voltage and current scales as expected.

The large majority of devices followed this trend. However, an important ﬁnding was that a few SiPMs
that are within speciﬁcations at 300 K show a slower decrease of the current with temperature. Thus, the
IV curves at 233 K are higher than the typical curves shown in Fig. 20. Although the diﬀerence may be
moderate, this is an indication that, in a few SiPM samples, the decrease of DCR with temperature does

not follow the exponential law as the majority of the population. Thus, at 77 K, the DCR could turn out
to be higher and, potentially, outside of speciﬁcations. This ﬁnding has very important implications for
DarkSide-20k, as it points directly to the need of studying this potential yield reduction on much larger
statistics and, if conﬁrmed, to the need of managing the appropriate selection of SiPMs that are fully
conforming to speciﬁcations. Ultimately, identiﬁcation of defective SiPMs cannot be performed at or near
300 K. The solution identiﬁed is the use of a cryogenic wafer automatic prober machine, for statistical studies
on large samples and, ultimately, for mass testing of all the SiPMs to be used. The cryogenic wafer probe
will be part of the Nuova Oﬃcina Assergi (NOA) packaging facility that will be built in the above-ground
site of LNGS.

Also performed at FBK were dedicated tests to check the SiPM performance reliability upon a sudden
large reduction of temperature. Full silicon wafers were repeatedly immersed in liquid nitrogen (LN2), fol-
lowing this procedure: immersion in LN2 for 10 min; immersion in LN2 2 h; and immersion in LN2 for 10
cycles lasting 2 min each. The DC electrical properties of all the SiPMs were cross-checked before and after
the cooling/warming procedures. No signiﬁcant changes were observed in either the reverse or forward IV
measurements, for any family of SiPMs.

6.4 Precision Characterization of FBK SiPMs

6.4.1 The SiPM Cryogenic Test Setup

A special cryogenic setup for precision characterization of the FBK SiPMs was built and commissioned at
LNGS. The cryogenic setup is contained inside a stainless steel vacuum chamber 500 mm in length and
closed by two DN 320 ISO-K ﬂanges. The cryostat is equipped with suﬃcient feedthroughs for the readout
of many SiPM signals via coaxial SMA connections, as well as the readout of the environmental parameters
and supply of the laser light via optical ﬁbers. An overall sketch of the system is shown in Fig. 21, with full
details presented in [117]. A Cryomech PT90 pulse tube cryocooler, capable of delivering 90 W of cooling
capacity at 77 K, is mounted on the top DN 320 ISO-K ﬂange.

The cold head of the cryocooler is equipped with a cold ﬁnger, which holds the SiPM assembly under
test, as shown in Fig. 22. This arrangement allows for a fast thermal cycle: the cold ﬁnger can be thermalized
from room temperature to 40 K in about 40 min. The use of a platinum RTD connected to a Lakeshore 335
temperature controller, which drives the thermal load required for temperature regulation directly to a set
of high power metal ﬁlm resistors mounted on the cold ﬁnger, allows the system to reach a temperature

stability of about 0.1 K and an accuracy of about 3 K in the range of interest 40 K to 300 K. To minimize
unwanted thermal gradients, the SiPM holders are made from 1.6 mm-thick aluminum printed circuit board
(PCB) using insulated metallic substrate (IMS) technology, to which the SiPM sample is bonded with the
silver-loaded conductive epoxy MasterBond EP21TDCS-LO. The holder is ﬁrmly connected to the cold ﬁnger
by a screw and a thin layer of cryogenic grease ensuring a good thermal contact between the copper and
the aluminum board. A cryogenic pre-ampliﬁer speciﬁcally designed for this application is connected to the
SiPM and is in thermal equilibrium with the cold ﬁnger.

The electronics chain used to readout the SiPMs in the LNGS cryogenic test setup is composed of:

– A SiPM bias source, feeding the SiPM from outside the cryostat and allowing for direct current-voltage

measurements in forward and reverse polarity;

– A cryogenic pre-ampliﬁer, directly connected to the device under test, and its bias source, built as a

transimpedance ampliﬁer (TIA) capable of stable cryogenic operations;

– A warm, low noise, single stage non-inverting ampliﬁer outside the cryostat, based on a high speed, low
noise operational ampliﬁer. This receives the signals from the pre-ampliﬁer that is inside the cryostat;
– A CAEN V1751 1 GS/s 10 bit digitizer, conﬁgured for interleaved acquisition and operated in auto-trigger

mode;

– A custom C++ program handles the conﬁguration and readout of the digitizer, and allows for a time
resolution of 8 ns, within a given acquisition frame, and an adjustable trigger. Data are saved in a custom
ﬁle format, with each frame in the ﬁle including the digitized waveform and a header, which contains
accurate timing information;

Full details of the front-end electronics, the data acquisition (DAQ) system and the software used to analyze
the data for the cryogenic characterization of the SiPMs, are given in [117].

of the noise response of the SiPM can be clearly identiﬁed: primary dark count (part of the Dark Count Rate, DCR),
Direct CrossTalk (DiCT), Delayed CrossTalk (DeCT), and AfterPulsing (AP) [117].

6.4.2 Identifying SiPM Pulses and Correlated Noise

The data analysis software was developed at FBK following the procedure described in [118]. It reads the
data stored in the data frames and performs a detailed analysis of SiPM response, with special emphasis on
the time correlation of pulses. The analysis capabilities are strongly enhanced by the addition of the time
tagging of frames, described in [117], which is mandated by the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in SiPM dark pulse rates
as a function of temperature that spans several orders of magnitude. The time tagging of frames allows for
the calculation of the time diﬀerence between consecutive pulses at the nanosecond scale using pulses within
the same frame, for up to thousands of seconds, using diﬀerent frames, with the only practical limit set by the
time available for measurement. This permits a seamless determination of the temperature-dependent SiPM
pulse rate, a detailed study of their correlation, and the extraction of the secondary noise probabilities. The
analysis is done the same way for data collected at all temperatures: each event is tagged with an ordered
pair of values, i.e. the time distance from the previous pulse and the amplitude. A typical scatter plot with
all ordered pairs recorded for data taken at 77 K and in the absence of light is shown in Fig. 23. The plot
allows for the identiﬁcation of diﬀerent families of pulses, composing the noise response of the SiPM.

DCR: The main group of events is determined by primary, Poisson-distributed, dark counts that make
up the Dark Count Rate, DCR. The amplitude is centered at around 1 PE, and the distribution in time is
an exponential with decay time corresponding to the inverse of the DCR.

DiCT: Direct CrossTalk (DiCT) events occur in a very short time interval given by the travel time
needed by the crosstalk photon to reach a neighboring cell and trigger an independent avalanche: the time
required is in the picosecond time scale, nearly impossible to be resolved with the readout electronics at
hand. As a result, single PE DiCT pulses are superimposed with the DCR pulses, since they have a similar
time distribution, but DiCT can be further characterized by pulses with greater amplitudes, corresponding
to the detection of 2 or 3 PE, or more.

DeCT: The least populated of the noise groups, with characteristic delay time of few to tens of nanosec-
onds, are due by Delayed CrossTalk (DeCT). These events are caused by crosstalk photons absorbed in the
non-depleted region of a neighboring cell. The carriers diﬀuse for a short time before reaching the high-ﬁeld
region, ﬁnally triggering an avalanche. The resulting pulse has the single cell amplitude but is delayed with
respect to the previous pulse by the characteristic diﬀusion time, typically on the order of a few to tens
of nanoseconds. Such delayed pulses can further trigger DiCT pulses, leading to events with the same time
distribution but larger amplitudes.

Fig. 24. Gain of the NUV-HD-LF SiPMs as a function of OV and temperature [117].

AP: Finally, the group of events with intermediate delay times and amplitude of 1 PE or less, are
identiﬁed as AfterPulsing (AP). AP occurs when, during an avalanche, an electron is trapped by some
impurity in the silicon lattice and is then released after a characteristic time, generating a second avalanche.
Since the AP event and its primary avalanche occur in the same cell, the time distribution is determined
by both the trap time constant and the recharge time constant of the microcell. When the time interval
is lower than the full micro-cell recharge, the resulting pulse has a reduced amplitude. As with the other
types of events, they can trigger DiCT pulses, explaining the higher amplitude noise groups with same time
distribution.

At the end of the analysis stage the following parameters are saved: primary DCR, correlated noise
probabilities (DiCT, DeCT, AP), and single cell signal features (amplitude, recovery time, charge delivered
in a ﬁxed time gate). Also stored is the waveform resulting from the application of the Diﬀerential Leading
Edge Discriminator (DLED) algorithm, as deﬁned in [119], which is useful for the evaluation of the breakdown
voltage (VBD), as the resulting peak amplitude is linear with the applied OV. Consideration of the DLED
amplitude as a function of OV typically allows a more precise determination of VBD than possible to derive
from the IV curve. This method allows to determine precisely the OV as a function of temperature. In order
to compare the SiPM DCR as a function of temperature, it is important that each point be taken at the
same OV. Therefore, any plot of DCR vs. OV is re-corrected in the analysis stage, by performing a linear
interpolation over the data to extract the correct DCR at the exact value of OV as determined with this
procedure. The same consideration applies for all the other SiPM features.

6.4.3 Characterization of NUV-HD SiPMs

The Single Cell Response (SCR) is deﬁned as the signal generated at the output of the ampliﬁer when a single
microcell of the SiPM ﬁres. The impedance Rq of the polysilicon resistor depends strongly on temperature,
increasing with decreasing temperature, therefore aﬀecting various signal features. The typical SiPM pulse
is made up of two diﬀerent components: a fast component, whose time constant τf is of the order of some
nanoseconds, and a slow component, whose time constant τs can extend to several microseconds, this time
constant corresponding to the SPAD recharge time. The electric model proposed in [120] is well suited
to describe the SiPM behaviour: the slow time constant is expected to be proportional to the quenching
resistance as in τs = Rq · (CSPAD + Cq), where Cq is the parasitic capacitance of the polysilicon resistor.
With decreasing temperature, the increase in Rq translates into higher values of τs. This eﬀect can be easily
appreciated in Fig. 16.

and temperature [117].

Using the LNGS system for cryogenic characterization of SiPMs and the analysis software developed for
this purpose, the recharge (recovery) time for the individual SPAD as a function of OV and temperature
could be determined. The peak amplitude of the SCR is mainly determined by the fast component of the
response, the amplitude of which increases linearly with OV and only very slowly with temperature (see
Fig. 16). For each pulse in the system, the gain of the SiPM is measured by comparing the integrated region
of interest (ROI) around the pulse to an ROI of similar size just before the pulse (pedestal), and by measuring
the distance between the peaks of the resulting distributions, it is possible to calculate the number of charge
carriers generated in the SPAD. See Fig. 24 for the measurement of the gain versus temperature and OV.
The variation with temperature is due to the fact that, with decreasing temperature and longer pulses, an
increasingly larger fraction of the total pulse sits out of the 500 ns integration gate. Near room temperature,
when the signal duration becomes shorter than the integration time, the gain is expected to saturate to a
plateau: the residual dependence on temperature observed is due to the variation with temperature of the
depletion width of each SPAD for a given OV. This happens because the breakdown voltage changes with
temperature as well. Therefore, a variation of the SPAD junction capacitance is also observed and, thus of
its gain.

The NUV-HD-LF SiPMs are especially optimized to achieve good performances in terms of DCR re-
duction at low temperature. They exhibit a DCR that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the
NUV-HD-SF at the same value of OV and temperature, see Fig. 25. The NUV-HD-LF SiPMs show lower
correlated noise with respect to the NUV-HD-SF SiPMs at the same OV, see Fig. 26. This is explained not
only by the overall lower gain and avalanche triggering probability in the NUV-HD-LF devices for the same
OV, but also by a suppression of some ﬁeld eﬀects contributing to this noise component. The AP reaches a
maximum in the temperature range from 60 K to 80 K and then decrease to zero in the high temperature
region. For AP, this peculiar dependence can be explained by the interplay of two diﬀerent phenomena
having opposite eﬀects on the noise probability: at low temperatures the trapping time constants increase,
enhancing the probability of a carrier to be released when the cell is at least partially recharged and is able
to trigger a new avalanche, thus eﬀectively producing an AP event. On the other hand, the quenching re-
sistance grows exponentially, partially suppressing the avalanche triggering probability during the recharge.
The DiCT exhibits only a weak dependence on the temperature, while it is linear in OV, see Fig. 27. The
DeCT has an extremely small probability, see Fig. 28.

6.5 The Cryogenic Transimpedence Ampliﬁer

The unique challenge in readout presented by SiPMs is mainly due to their capacitance: at 50 pF/mm2,
a single SiPM with 5 × 5 mm2 surface passes the nF scale for capacitance. Yet, the experiment foresees a
photosensing area of 14 m2.

The readout of a LAr calorimeter faced a similar challenge, with capacitance for the individual cells often
passing the nF scale [121]. Early developments on LAr calorimeter readout [122,123,124,125] demonstrated
that the use of a transimpedance ampliﬁer (TIA) is preferable to a charge integration ampliﬁer, whose noise
and rise time are very strongly aﬀected by the large detector capacitance.

The DarkSide Collaboration has developed and optimized a TIA with performance at 87 K in mind [126].
The speciﬁc goal was to maximize the ampliﬁcation factor while preserving a stable signal bandwidth and
SNR.

A schematic view of the TIA is shown in Fig. 29. The actual value of Rf depends on the size and the
characteristics of the SiPMs (detector capacitance Cd and signal bandwidth), with typical values from 2 kΩ
to 6 kΩ, while Cf is only due to the parasitic capacitance of the circuit and can be estimated as about 1 pF.
The implementation of the TIA includes a few components required to stabilize the circuit at cryogenic
temperature (given the very high Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBP)). The cryogenic TIA consists of a high
speed very low noise operational ampliﬁer capable of operating in the temperature range 40 K to 300 K.
Fig. 30 shows the AVol, NG, and Tz for the TIA with a speciﬁc conﬁguration of the circuit components.
While full details of the TIA will be given in a later publication, it is stated here that the performance of
the TIA has met the required speciﬁcations of the DarkSide-20k experiment.

6.6 Signal-to-Noise Ratio measurement on FBK SiPMs

The following measurements were performed at LNGS in a dewar ﬁlled with liquid nitrogen, where the
SiPMs were illuminated by a Edinburgh Instruments EPL-405 ps pulsed diode laser, which also served as
the trigger sync. The signal, after further ampliﬁcation at room temperature, is then measured and directly
histogrammed by a LeCroy 204MXi-A oscilloscope. The histogram of the signals includes the peaks from
single and multiple photoelectrons and the baseline noise corresponding to events where no photons were
recorded. In order to better estimate this parameter, as many peaks as possible are ﬁt within the spectrum;

σ2

SNR is deﬁned as the ratio of the average SPE signal to the noise of the baseline: this deﬁnition is ﬂexible

and several quantities of use can be identiﬁed:

SNRAmplitude: The SPE amplitude is evaluated as the diﬀerence between the maximum signal ampli-
tude and the median of the baseline (estimated in the pre-trigger window), while the noise is measured as
the standard deviation of the baseline in the pre-trigger. For this measurement technique, the ﬁrst peak
corresponds to the events where no photon was detected by the SiPM under test: its shape is not gaussian
since it is ﬁlled to the maximum value of the baseline in a ﬁxed gate (100 ns) and its median is correlated to
the crest factor of the noise of the baseline. Therefore the ﬁrst peak is not used in the analysis.

SNRCharge: The SPE charge is evaluated as the diﬀerence between the integral of the signal in a ﬁxed

window (typically 1 µs) and the integral of the baseline in a gate of the same duration.

SNRFast: Deﬁned as SNRCharge but for a short integration window, corresponding to the fast discharge

peak of high Rq SiPMs.

SNRFiltered: Deﬁned as SNRAmplitude on a ﬁltered signal. An optimal ﬁlter technique is used with an

RC ﬁlter that has τ matched to the SiPM recharge time.

Table 6 provides a summary of the performances of the devices tested throughout the DarkSide program.

6.6.1 Single SiPM

The ﬁrst step to the measurement of the SNR expected in DarkSide-20k consisted of testing single SiPM
devices connected to the TIA, before performing the measurement with the SiPM tiles. NUV-HD-LF-HRq
SiPMs of area 10 × 10 mm2 were studied, results of the measurements are shown in Fig. 31, Fig. 32, and
Fig. 33. The measurements of 10 × 10 mm2 NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPMs was performed with a TIA speciﬁcally
tuned to obtain the maximum SNR with the device under test, allowing to reach a very high level of SNR.
Two general outcomes of the measurement were:

1. The ﬁt to the standard deviations of the distribution of the photoelectron peaks is well described by

the model introduced in the previous section;

2. The intrinsic dispersion of the SPE peak (σ2

SPE/SPE) is diﬀerent between amplitude and charge but is
quite compatible between the families: for charge it is approximately 2 % while for amplitude is approximately
4 %.

6.6.2 Optimal SiPMs Connection Scheme

In the most trivial readout scheme, where all the SiPMs are readout in parallel, Cd is simply the sum of
all SiPMs capacities, resulting in a degraded SNR. An even more important eﬀect of the very large input
capacitance is the slowing down of the ampliﬁer response. The bandwidth of the ampliﬁer is proportional to
fRes, which is deﬁned as:

in series-parallel (right).

GBP is the gain-bandwidth product, Cd is the detector capacitance, Cf is the parasitic capacitance and
Rf is the recharge resistance. It is fundamental to maintain an overall bandwidth in excess of 20 MHz to
30 MHz to be able to reconstruct the timing of a photon with a resolution of 10 ns (even in condition of a low
SNR). Moreover, to appropriately treat the fast peak produced by high Rq, a SiPM minimum bandwidth of
50 MHz is required. Lowering Rf is not possible, since the peaking of the noise gain would increase, much
to the detriment of the SNR. The only option is to lower Cd.

A possible improvement comes from the consideration of a hybrid readout scheme, with parallel-series
combination of SiPMs, as shown in Fig. 34, and ﬁrst introduced for the MEG experiment [127,128]. In
this conﬁguration, the output signal of an individual SiPM is reduced by a factor equal to the number of
SiPMs put in series, but this disadvantage is oﬀset by the attenuation of noise gain due to the reduction
in the input capacitance (thus in this case ending in the same SNR obtainable with a single device). Most
importantly, the improvement of the bandwidth with respect to the parallel readout scheme is achieved, with
nine SiPMs easily readout connecting three sets of three parallel connected SiPMs in series (know as the
3p3s conﬁguration) with the same bandwidth of a single SiPM in input.

6.6.3 NUV-HD tile

For the next step, the measurement of SNR for a tile of NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPMs was performed, each of area
5 × 5 mm2, arranged in a 4p4s conﬁguration (similar to the 3p3s conﬁguration, but now with four sets of four
parallel connected SiPMs connected in series) and covering a total area of 4 cm2. For this tile, all the SNR
types were measured, see Fig. 35 and Table 6: in all cases the spectrum of the single photo-electrons remain
clearly visible. However, the noise in the measurement of the amplitude is excessive, leading to problems in
the realization of larger tiles. This is discussed in the next section.

6.7 Noise-driven Limits on Tile Surface Scaling

6.7.1 Hit Identiﬁcation Theory

As explained in the previous sections, electronic noise poses serious limitations to the design of an operating
SiPM tile. The identiﬁcation of the SPE in the signal acquired from a tile is of primary importance for

the trigger algorithm, as well as for the downstream analysis. A hit is typically identiﬁed when it crosses a
threshold: diﬀerent noise conditions can aﬀect the number of noise hits crossing the threshold or aﬀect the
eﬃciency of the algorithm to identify a real photoelectron.

To estimate the rate of fake hits injected in the system due to baseline noise, it is necessary to introduce
a noise model. A white band-limited noise was assumed, with baseline RMS of σBaseline and an upper cutoﬀ

The ineﬃciency of the threshold is deﬁned as the number of signals with peak value between 0 and the

threshold of the gaussian best ﬁtting the SPE peak. This ineﬃciency aﬀects the overall light yield.

The noise hit and the threshold eﬃciency are shown as a function of the threshold level in Fig. 36 for the
signal from the NUV-HD-LF tile described earlier: the plot on the top panel corresponds to the bare signal
(relative than to SNRAmplitude measurement) while the plot on the bottom panel corresponds to the signal
ﬁltered by a low pass RC ﬁlter with τ = 400 ns. As seen in the ﬁgure, one can achieve 95 % eﬃciency while
keeping a 100 kHz frequency tuning range, as well as a great improvement of performance with the addition
of the ﬁlter.

6.7.2 Hit Identiﬁcation Experimentation

To verify the model, the darknoise of the NUV-HD-LF-HRq tile of total area of 4 cm2 was measured in
liquid nitrogen. The setup included the full tile + TIA, an external ampliﬁer conﬁgured for optimal ﬁl-
ter and a readout based on the CAEN V1751. The threshold was set to 0.4 PE. The resulting rate was
(5.1 ± 0.1) counts/s, corresponding to 13 mHz/mm2 at 6 V of OV. The measurement is compatible with the
value measured for smaller device and proves that the fake hits can be signiﬁcantly rejected (rate is much
lower than the darknoise requirement of 0.1 Hz/mm2).

6.7.3 Surface Size for NUV-HD-LF-HRq tiles

The reason for the limited SNRAmplitude of the NUV-HD tile is related to the intrinsic limitation of the
TIA. The total charge of the fast peak is about one tenth of the full gain of the SiPM, this means a charge
of about 2 × 105 e−. Considering the duration of the fast peak (about 20 ns for NUV-HD-LF-HRq devices
with Rs = 60 Ohm), the peak current results in around 3 µA with a bandwidth of about 30 MHz. Diﬀerent
values of Rs can lower the bandwidth at a detriment to the peak current (the integral of the pulse remains
constant). Moreover, given the 4p4s conﬁguration, the eﬀective signal arriving to the pre-ampliﬁer is reduced
by a factor 4, leading to a detectable peak current of 0.75 µA.

With a surface of 5 × 5 mm2 in the 4p4s conﬁguration, and a Rf of 4 kΩ, the bandwidth amounts to
30 MHz (in fully parallel conﬁguration would instead be 8 MHz). The noise of the TIA can be calculated from
the formulas given in [130] or simulated. In this conﬁguration, the input equivalent noise of the TIA is around
100 nA, corresponding to a SNRAmplitude = 0.75 µA/100 nA = 7.5 (to be compared with the measured value
of 6.0, see Table 6).

A further optimization may be possible, for a gain in SNRAmplitude of a factor of about 2, but push-
ing the performance of the TIA much further does not look feasible given the current technologies. Since
measurements have shown that SNR should scale with the square root of surface area, a diﬀerent SiPM
conﬁguration must be used for tiles built from the current NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPMs to extend the total area
to 50 × 50 mm2. Preliminary test results show that this can achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio for a
single PDM. Improvement to the NUV-HD-LF SiPMs in order to achieve more stable operation at 87 K with
lower Rq is foreseen.

6.7.4 Strategy for Tile Readout in DarkSide-20k

Considering the arguments discussed above about the hit rate at diﬀerent SNR, the readout requires a
cautious design to maintain the eﬀectiveness of the trigger and the downstream analysis. Considering a
photodetector module (PDM) with 2 analog channels each and a 50 × 50 mm2 NUV-HD-LF-HRq tile, a
direct discrimination of the signal is not possible (as shown in the top panel of Fig. 36, the rate would be
excessive). Therefore, discrimination will be made on the (optimal) ﬁltered signal, while timing of the hit
is done using the unﬁltered signal. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 36, and as already experimentally
proven, see discussion in Sec. 6.7.2, the hit discrimination of ﬁltered signals guarantees a very strong rejection

of uncorrelated electronic noise with a very high detection eﬃciency for real photoelectrons. The readout
design, as shown in Fig. 37, acquires the unﬁltered signal in a window of 4 µs around the hit and produces
no noise contribution from the baseline. In fact, as shown in the top panel of Fig. 36, a 96 % detection
eﬃciency corresponds to about 100 kHz and would end up in a probability of 5 % for one fake hit in the
speciﬁed window. Additionally, a more reﬁned analysis like a likelihood based one can reduce this term
further. The identiﬁcation of the hit in the unﬁltered signal allows for the precise timing (better than 10 ns)

and in [126] the ﬁrst prototype photodetector module meeting all of the DarkSide-20k requirements has now
been demonstrated.

6.8 SiPM Packaging

Individual SiPMs will be mounted on 50 × 50 mm2 patterned substrates to form detector tiles. A detector tile
provides bias distribution, a signal summing resistor network, and a low-mass connector for mating the tile
to a front-end board (FEB). The substrate material will be selected for its compatibility with conventional
lithography techniques, its mechanical robustness, and the availability of radio-pure wafers.

A set of prototype SiPM tiles have been assembled on FR4 substrates, an example of which is shown in
Fig. 38. These prototype tiles route the anode and cathode of each SiPM to a high density connector on the
back-side of the board that mates to a carrier PCB. This ﬂexible design allows the tile to be used to measure
the cryogenic performance of individual SiPMs, as well as to test diﬀerent SiPM summing schemes described
in this section. SiPM dies are mounted on the prototype tile using cryogenic silver loaded epoxy that has
been tested for mechanical and electrical stability after thermal cycling. The epoxy is screened onto the tile
in a 60 µm thick layer, creating a coplanar surface on which the SiPM dies are placed with a manual die
bonder. An alternative to cryogenic epoxy is being developed in which a grid of 50 µm gold balls are placed
on the back of the SiPM die, forming a bump-bond style surface-mount package. Currently, the top-side
SiPM contact is made with gold ball wire-bonds. Eventually, the production of SiPM dies will move to an
external foundry. The next generation will use through silicon vias (TSV) into the SiPM design, moving both
contacts to the back-side of the die and eliminating the need for wire-bonding in lieu of an all bump-bonded
interface. The IV curve of each SiPM on the tile is measured before and after the SiPM die is mounted, and
a report is generated for each tile that details the properties of the tile, the tile assembly procedure, and
individual SiPM performance. This information will eventually be included in a materials and parts tracking
database currently under development.

The transition from conventional PCB substrates to alternative substrates is currently underway. The
tile will be double-sided, requiring through hole vias, and will have a network of thin ﬁlm summing re-
sistors deposited directly on the substrates. Studies are also being done on the fabrication of thin ﬁlm
nickel-chromium summing resistors, focused on optimizing the resistor geometry and the nickel-chromium
deposition parameters.

6.9 The DarkSide-20k Photodetector Modules

Fig. 38. Prototype SiPM tile on an FR-4 substrate.

The photodetector module (PDM) will be the basic unit for photon detection in the LAr TPC. The PDM is
conceived to be equipped with a tile array of SiPMs covering a nominal surface area of 50 × 50 mm2, along
with a set of cryogenic TIAs. The TIAs will receive and shape the signals from the 50 × 50 mm2 tiles, then
transmit them over dedicated transmission lines through the cryostat penetration to be received by the warm
electronic modules residing outside the LAr TPC.

The top and bottom surfaces of the LAr TPC will be covered by PDMs grouped in arrays of 5 × 5 and
mounted on a common motherboard providing a convenient mechanical, electrical and thermal interface
among the LAr TPC and the PDMs. The mechanical structure of the PDM and its assembly procedures
must be as light and simple as possible, both to reduce the amount of dead material in the LAr TPC and
to ease the production of the large number of PDMs needed for the experiment.

The PDM will provide a reliable mechanical frame to connect the tiles and the FEBs. The structure
will be able to withstand the thermal cycles from warm to cryogenic temperature envisaged for the testing,
characterization and running phases of the experiment. The PDM will also provide an adequate thermal
path from the TIA active components, whose thermal dissipation to the motherboard is foreseen to be below
250 mW per tile, in order to mitigate bubbling in the LAr TPC as much as possible.

The current PDM assembly design is the one depicted in Fig. 39. In the speciﬁc design presented in this
ﬁgure, the 50 × 50 mm2 tile is built from an array of 5 × 5 SiPMs. The back side of the tile hosts the electrical
connectors to the FEBs and four soldered proﬁles suitable for a snap-ﬁt joint with the plastic cage devoted to
latching the tile to the FEBs. The thermal contact is loose in order not to transfer heat from the FEBs to the
SiPMs and to maintain their working temperature at 87 K. The snap-ﬁt proﬁle material will be preferably
OFHC copper because of its radiopurity and its good soldering properties. The connectors will have to mate
with the FEB providing some axial ﬂoat (roughly 1 mm) to accommodate for the mechanical misalignment
of the TIA components and some radial ﬂoat (roughly 0.5 mm) to accommodate for the mismatch in the
thermal dilatation of diﬀerent materials.

Readily available connectors from reliable suppliers are not speciﬁed for operations in LAr, hence extensive
tests at cryogenic temperature are needed to identify a good working candidate. Radiopurity qualiﬁcation
and detailed G4DS studies are necessary to validate the impact of these components on the total background
rate.

The FEBs will be provided with mating connectors that attach to the SiPM tile, to the power supplies
(low voltages for the FEBs and bias voltage for the SiPM), and to the transmission lines for communicating
with the DAQ electronic residing outside the LAr TPC. In summary, each FEB will contain: common ground;
two rails for the low voltage power supplies for the TIA and transmitter; a bias voltage for the SiPM; the
output signal, a twisted pair cable or an optical ﬁber.

FEBs.

6.9.1 PDM Thermal Model

Precise control of the temperature of the components of the PDMs is of paramount importance. The SiPM
performance strongly depends on the temperature, and hence a sizable eﬀort is devoted to the thermal
management design of the PDM. As stated in Sec. 5.7, a heat load greater than >5 kW will cause the onset
of bubbling in LAr contained in the bottom of the cryostat. In this respect, the heat load from the FEBs is
not a big concern, provided that the PDM is able to evenly distribute the heat dissipated by its electronic
components to the whole supporting motherboard. A total power dissipation of about 40 mW for a ﬁrst FEB
prototype assembled on FR4 was measured. The worst conditions will be presumably the ones experienced
by the top readout plane, where the pressure is limited due to the smaller LAr depth, however, bubbling
for the top array is not a problem, since any bubbles produced there will be on the top side of the anode
window and hence will not enter the TPC.

The heat is mainly dissipated by the operational ampliﬁer whose surface area is only 0.1 cm2. Good
thermal contact between the operational ampliﬁer and the tile substrate is thus of paramount importance in
order to prevent boiling. To further improve the thermal exchange eﬃciency to the LAr and reduce the risk
of bubbling and thermal run-away, the TIA substrate has a copper bridge to the motherboard that provides
an additional thermal exchange surface area with the LAr.

A detailed thermal simulation using the ANSYS FEM suite has begun to be implemented, in order to
predict the device temperature reached under realistic running conditions and the resulting stresses due
to combination of diﬀerent materials. A preliminary result is reported in Fig. 40, obtained in the worst
case scenario in which thermal exchange by conduction and convection through the surrounding medium is
neglected. A working point of 77 K was chosen, in order to be able to easily replicate this result with a small
laboratory setup.

In the ANSYS simulation, the heat transfer is only through the substrate/indium/copper joints and the
boundary condition is set on the copper plate that is kept at LN2 temperature. The electrical connections

data is used for sapphire and OFHC copper. The device is mounted on a copper support, a picture of which is shown
in Fig. 41.

environment close to the ﬁnal one. Indium pellets are placed on top of the thermal joint and squeezed on top of the

and one as thermometer) in close thermal contact with the sapphire itself.

between the preampliﬁer and the SiPM tile were modeled as small copper prisms with an eﬀective thermal
conductance tunable by changing the contact surface.

The results in Fig. 40 show a maximum ∆T ≈ 0.3 K. Considering the relation between temperature
and vapor pressure of Ar, and the hydrostatic pressure of the overlying LAr, one ﬁnds a maximum allowable
temperature diﬀerence of about 2 K, which is well above the result obtained from the preliminary simulation.
In order to validate the results from the simulation, a small setup was prepared in which a sapphire
tile of size 50 × 50 mm2 is equipped with resistors to simulate the thermal load and sensors to measure the
temperature distribution (see Fig. 41). PT100 RTDs were used as both heater and temperature sensors. The
heater PT100 is biased with a high current in order to dissipate 100 mW. In this way one could measure the
self-heating of the heat load, which can be scaled to the active component. Furthermore, the PT100 RTDs
have the advantage of providing a highly linear R(T ) relationship that can be used to obtain a precision
on the order of 0.1 K. In order to suppress the heat exchange through convection and conduction in the

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

surrounding medium, a thermally insulating cover made of plastic foam was applied. The sapphire tile is
clamped in the OFHC structure made from a plate with three pillars whose base is kept in liquid nitrogen.
Each pillar has a 1 mm3 indium pellet squeezed between the copper and sapphire in order to have a thermal
conductance as close as possible to the ﬁnal one. Preliminary results from the setup are in good agreement
with the results of simulation.

6.10 Motherboards

The motherboards will be made of pure copper and will be fabricated in the format of square motherboards
(SQBs) and triangular motherboards (TRBs). The SQB (TRB) will host 25 (15) PDMs, anchored by copper
screws on one side and kapton strip printed circuits on the other side. The kapton strips connect the steering
module (see Sec. 6.13) to the PDMs, providing the TIA low voltages and the SiPM bias voltage. In addition,
the analog diﬀerential signals from the PDMs are routed into a single connector.

6.11 Signal Transmission

The signal transmission from the PDMs to the warm electronics is of primary importance for the experiment.
Given the high number of independent channels, the cables will introduce a large mass in the cryostat with
the inherent problems of radio-purity and heat load. Single ended technology over coaxial cables can provide
high signal integrity and good immunity to electronic noise with a simple cryogenic transmission stage.
However, the use of traditional coaxial cables is impractical since coaxial braid may contain radioisotopes of
lead and silver. To overcome these problems, two alternative solutions are being developed: a fully diﬀerential
cryogenic analog transmitter and an optical analog cryogenic transmitter.

6.11.1 Diﬀerential Transmitter

A low power cryogenic analog diﬀerential transmitter and a matching room temperature receiver has been
developed at LNGS. The speciﬁcations for operation at 87 K are:

Transmitter-i Gain of 27 V/V with a ﬂatness of 1 dB;
Transmitter-ii f3Db of 65 MHz;
Hz, corresponding to 600 µV of output noise RMS;
Transmitter-iii Input noise equivalent of 2.3 nV/
Transmitter-iv Output swing of 1.3 V with 1 dB of compression. This correspond to a dynamic range

√

in excess of 100, if the single photoelectron peak is placed at 12 mV (20 times the transmitter noise).

A prototype transmitter was built and operated, at both 300 K and 77 K. The power dissipation at 77 K

is around 5 mW.

Signal transmission is foreseen over twisted pair cables with a FEP (extrudable PTFE-variant) jacket,
providing good radio-purity levels and low section copper conductors. This solution provides strong immunity
to ground loops and moderate immunity to noise pickup and cross-talk between channels.

6.12 Cabling

The cabling system described in this section refers to signal and power cables necessary to operate the SiPM
sensors and the cold electronics. These services transport:
– Signal readouts from the cold electronics to the data acquisition system located outside the cryostat;
– Control signals in and out of the cryostat;
– Low voltage power from the remote power supplies to the sensor.

The signal and power cable will penetrate the cryostat through a dedicated top ﬂange, where conﬂat
ﬂange-mounted connectors will terminate the high-purity cryogenics cables and will connect them to standard
warm cables on the outside of the detector. The speciﬁcations discussed in this section refer to the cryogenic
part of the cabling system only. From the cabling system standpoint, a large-area tile is preferable to reduce
the overall number of cables to be extracted from the cryostat as well as the heat transfer.

Based on the results of preliminary tests, speciﬁcations for the cryogenic cables are given as:
Cable-i Type: FEP shielded twisted pair;
Cable-ii Average length: 7 m;

Cable-ix Pair grouping: possible;
Cable-x Minimum bending radius after grouping: not exceeding 10 cm.
Several signal cable manufacturers have been contacted and cable samples are being acquired so that

cable material purity may be screened.

6.13 Power Distribution

The power required per PDM, up to the maximum value of 250 mW established as a requirement, including
the power requirement of the TIA, the transmitter, and the SiPMs, is too small to be distributed individually.
A more realistic solution is to build a steering module (SM) that acts as a power distribution network in
proximity of the loads, i.e. the PDMs. So, the choice for low voltage power distribution cables presently
considered for the experiment is based on the assumption that a single power channel will serve approximately
50 PDMs, connected to the same power supply and distributing low (±2 V) and high voltage (<150 V) to
all connected PDMs. An approximate number of 220 units would be required for the entire detector. This
solution has the advantage of reducing the number of cables to be extracted from the cryostat and of
optimizing the number of power supplies used in the experiment. A conceptual design of this board, based
on an output buﬀered shift register, was developed by ETHZ, see Fig. 42.

The physical location of the SMs will be in the LAr, in close vicinity to the PDMs, requiring a cryo-
genic electronics design. The signal output lines (copper/optical) of the PDMs will be routed directly to
feedthroughs in the periphery of the detector. PDMs will be selected for similar breakdown voltage and
associated to SM groups with a single bias voltage supply from the outside. Besides grouping the power

61

lines, this board should have the additional functionality of being able to turn oﬀ individual PDMs in case
of malfunctioning. To disable a faulty PDM, the SMs can be programmed via a serial interface to disconnect
individual modules from all supply voltages.

The design shown in Fig. 42 consists of two blocks. Memory cells from a shift register receive and store
the state of operation of each PDM by a serial data bus. The logic output levels (TTL) of the memory cells
are then used to drive MOS-FETs switches from individual PDM units. The board has to operate reliably
at cryogenic temperatures with a power consumption <200 mW per board. The possible integration of an
FPGA in the design is under study. If necessary, more complex tasks like ﬁne tuning of the bias voltages or
monitoring detector module performances (or others that are similar), could then be accomplished, but this
would require an increase in power of the SM boards.

6.14 The SiPM and PDM Test Facility

Testing of the large quantity of SiPMs and PDMs will be done in a clean room environment, in two test
stations. The ﬁrst test station is dry, with the cryocooling provided by a 60 W pulse tube refrigerator. It
consists of a cylindrical cryostat, 50 cm high and 40 cm in diameter, which can reach a vacuum level of
10−9 bar before cryocooling. The cold ﬁnger can be connected to up to 4 copper plates, of up to 36 cm in
diameter, suﬃcient to accommodate 1 SQB motherboard each, for a total of up to 4 SQB hosted in the
system at the same time. The dry test station will be equipped with the necessary feedthroughs for the
individual illumination, voltage supply and signal readout of the PDMs. The dry test station is already
equipped with an external relay matrix system that enables, on special development tiles, the readout of
individual SiPMs as well as their readout in a ﬂexible series/parallel conﬁguration.

The second is a wet test station, fed with either LN2 or LAr directly by either of the two storage tanks,
see Fig. 43. It consists of a cylindrical cryostat, 120 cm high and 60 cm in diameter, which can reach a vacuum
level of 10−9 bar before cryocooling. The cryostat can host up to 4 holding plates, of up to 55 cm in diameter,
suﬃcient to accommodate 2 SQB motherboards each, for a total of 4 SQB motherboards simultaneously.
This system will also be equipped with the necessary feedthroughs for the individual illumination, voltage
supply and signal readout of the PDMs.

Optical ﬁbers facing the center of the PDMs are connected to one of the outputs of two 1x25 fused
couplers located in an external black-box. Light pulses are generated by a Hamamatsu PLP10 light pulser,
equipped with a 408 nm laser head and pulse width of 70 ps. The wavelength is chosen to be consistent
with the wavelength-shifted light in the experiment. The laser is piped to the the splitters through optical
attenuator mounts. Discrete ﬁlters of diﬀerent attenuation coeﬃcients can be used.

The DAQ system provides each acquisition channel full signal digitization, in order to allow the detailed
PDMs characterization in terms of: workfunction; pulse shape (recharge time); single photon response; dark
rate; stability in time; correlated pulses; and, robustness to mechanical stress tests.

Optionally, PDE measurements will be feasible in the wet test station for a limited fraction of about 1 %

of the PDM production run.

Since each of the two stations can accommodate up to 4 SQB motherboards at once, 100 PDMs can be
tested simultaneous. With one run per week, a test of all of the PDMs required for DarkSide-20k could be
performed in one year.

6.15 Summary and Outlook

The NUV-HD-LF-HRq already meets the stringent requirements of DarkSide-20k. The ﬁnal goal of developing
tiles and PDMs of area 50 × 50 mm2 was achieved in 2017 [126]. With these SiPMs, the collaboration has
achieved some of the ﬁrst (perhaps the ﬁrst) demonstration of large area, 20 × 20 mm2 and 50 × 50 mm2,
SiPM assemblies operated as a single channel photodetector with very high PDE and sensitivity to single
scintillation photons.

With the development of SiPMs at FBK’s own production facility, a milestone for the DarkSide-20k
experiment has been reached. The production of the large area, (14 m2) required for DarkSide-20k necessitates
the transfer of prototyping and production to an external foundry. Details of the performance will depend
on the outﬁt of choice, as the details of the implantation proﬁles and of the silicon contamination during
its process will likely inﬂuence major characteristics of the SiPMs, such as the DCR. In order to make
further progress, the procedures required for the selection of an external foundry to accompany the entire
development process of the SiPMs must be followed.

62

In the next two years, it is planned to achieve further improvements on the NUV-HD-LF technology to
help manage the risks associated with the production of tiles and related electronics. Depending on new
results of the functional characterization of SiPMs, and taking into account the constraints of the read-out
electronics, new speciﬁc development runs may be needed. For example, the ﬁrst requirement may be an
extension of the OV, mainly to facilitate the signal read-out on very large area SiPMs. The most important
action items as of today are:

ACT-i Transfer of the production to an external foundry able to accompany the entire development

process of the SiPMs;

ACT-ii Start of the process of mass characterization of the performance of NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPMs at

300 K and at 87 K with a cryogenic wafer probe in the NOA;

ACT-iii Further reduction of the electric ﬁeld for the NUV-HD-LF technology;
ACT-iv Improvement of the production process of NUV-HD-LF-HRq SiPMs in order to have stable

behavior at cryogenic temperature with lower quenching resistors;

ACT-v Increase of the charge of the fast component, maintaining a ﬁxed total capacitance.

7 Liquid Argon TPC

7.1 Introduction and Requirements

The DarkSide-20k LAr TPC is the dark matter detector and the central element of the experiment, with
all auxiliary detectors and systems speciﬁed and designed in support of the LAr TPC. To achieve its stated
physics goals, the LAr TPC must respond to a stringent set of requirements. In particular, it must:

LAr TPC-i Provide 20 t target mass after ﬁducial volume cuts;
LAr TPC-ii Employ only radio-pure materials of well known performance in LAr, such as OFHC copper

(Cu), Teﬂon (PTFE), low radioactivity stainless steel, and titanium;

LAr TPC-iii Minimize the use of hydrogen-containing materials to avoid compromising the eﬀectiveness

of the LSV;

LAr TPC-iv Provide S1 light yield at least as high as the 10 PE/keV at null ﬁeld, via employment of

large-area, densely-packed custom arrays of photosensors;

LAr TPC-v Enable stable application of a cathode voltage of −52 kV, required to generate the drift

ﬁeld;

tion;

LAr TPC-xii Provide access for optical ﬁbers that will carry narrow, low-photon-occupancy light pulses

for photosensor calibration.

7.2 Design Overview

The LAr TPC operates in a two-phase mode, utilizing both the liquid and gas phases of argon, as in
DarkSide-50. Fig. 44 shows a 3D representation of the LAr TPC contained inside the cryostat. The cryostat
holds ∼35 t of LAr in total, with 23 t inside the instrumented (active) LAr TPC. Table 7 lists some of the
key parameters of the LAr TPC.

The active LAr volume is deﬁned by a transparent conductive indium-tin-oxide (ITO) cathode at the
bottom, a grid just below the liquid surface, separating the electron drift and extraction regions at the top,
and a reﬂecting surface with an octagonal footprint on the sides. The thin argon gas electroluminescence
region above the liquid surface is bounded by a ﬂat diving bell shaped ITO anode electrode at the top.
Interactions in the active LAr volume generate prompt scintillation light that gives the S1 signal. A high
voltage is applied between the cathode and grid to produce a vertical electric ﬁeld to drift the ionization
electrons created at the interaction site upward. An independently-adjustable potential between the grid
and anode creates the ﬁelds to extract the electrons into the gas and accelerate them to create secondary
scintillation, called electroluminescence, which gives the S2 signal. Both the S1 and S2 signals are detected
by top and bottom arrays of SiPM photosensors which view the active LAr volume through large acrylic
windows. This design maximizes light yield and it is the same concept of S2 generation as was tested in
DarkSide-50, namely a thin layer of gas generated below an anode in the form of conductive and transparent
ITO ﬁlm deposited on the transparent supporting window, allowing for liquid argon to occupy the space
above the window. The cathode and anode plane designs require octagonal windows with a width of roughly
290 cm, and since there are no available ultra-high-purity fused silica plates of this size, acrylic is the material
of choice.

Fig. 45. Cathode region of the LAr TPC.

The wavelength of the argon scintillation and electroluminescence signals is in the far UV region, at
128 nm. Therefore, it must be wavelength-shifted before being detected by light sensing devices. To maxi-
mize the light yield, all inner surfaces delimiting the active volume are coated with the wavelength shifter
tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB), which absorbs the 128 nm scintillation light and reemits it with high eﬃ-
ciency [131] in the blue region (∼420 nm).

The S1 signal is distributed roughly equally over both arrays, while the S2 signal, emitted in the gas
pocket, is concentrated in the top array and within a few SiPM tiles around the transverse position of the
ionization drift, thus yielding a precise x−y location. The drift time (the time between the S1 and S2 signals)
determines the z-location of the event in the LAr TPC. Three dimensional precision imaging of an event can
thus be achieved, with an expected resolution of 10 mm in x − y and 1 mm in z.

7.3 Drift, Extraction and Electroluminescence System Design

The electric ﬁeld conﬁguration inside the LAr TPC consists of an active LAr volume with an applied uniform
drift ﬁeld of 200 V/cm, 3 mm of LAr above the grid with an extraction ﬁeld of 2.8 kV/cm, and a 7 mm-thick
argon gas pocket with an electroluminescence ﬁeld of the order of 4.2 kV/cm.

The bottom boundary of the active volume, shown in Fig. 45, is a 15 mm thick acrylic window coated on
both sides with a thin layer of ITO. The top ITO layer, together with a contacting guard ring serve as the
cathode. The potential of the cathode plane is ﬁxed at −52 kV. The bottom SiPM array is placed <2 mm
below the bottom ITO layer, which is held at ground. The acrylic window can easily sustain the applied

electric ﬁeld, while the P-proﬁle copper guard rings contact the bottom ITO layers and serve to minimize
the electric ﬁeld at the ITO edge, avoiding discharges in the LAr. This concept was tested to be electrically
stable up to about −65 kV with a full-scale mock-up of the DarkSide-50 cathode region, using a 6.5 mm thick
fused silica window in an open dewar. The solid contacting guard ring will be used to mechanically hold
the TPC above the cathode and make contact to the top ITO layer on the acrylic with multi-spring-loaded
pins. The acrylic will be held by a sandwich-type structure, such that no load is applied onto the acrylic
to avoid potential stress and breakage, see details in Fig. 45. The structure also allows the acrylic to shrink
and slide inward, yet still cover the full bottom SiPM array. The guard ring below the acrylic is also used to
smooth the HV ﬁeld lines and provide contact to the bottom grounded ITO layer. Note that Fig. 45 shows
the cathode structure details at room temperature. At LAr temperature, the edge of the acrylic, as well as
the ﬁeld cage, will shrink inwards. The cathode plane, with its support structure, acts as a rigid frame such
that it is strong enough to hold the TPC. The cathode is ﬁxed on the bottom grounded frame by a number
of PTFE pillars with walls grooved for cathode HV related concerns. The edge of the acrylic and the ﬂat
faces of any insulator in this region will be grooved based on the same techniques applied in DarkSide-50.

When cold, the distance between the anode and the cathode is 239 cm and the active eﬀective diameter is
290 cm. The total drift distance in liquid is 238 cm. A uniform electric drift ﬁeld in the LAr TPC is provided
by a ﬁeld cage consisting of a set of 119 octagonal ﬁeld shaping rings, equally spaced along the z-axis and
biased with a uniform voltage gradient. Each ﬁeld shaping ring is constructed from 8 overlapping Cu tubes
and held in place using 8 Cu pins and 8 Cu corner pieces set into the PTFE reﬂector cage (see Fig. 46).
The rings have an oval cross section with height of 1.6 cm and are spaced at 2 cm center-to-center. They are
separated from the active volume by the 2.5 cm thick PTFE structure. The rings are hollow to help minimize
the weight of the Cu ﬁeld cage, which is mounted onto the PTFE reﬂector cage (see Fig. 46), which in turn
is supported from the very bottom stainless steel ﬂange that hangs from the cryostat.

The uniform voltage gradient is provided by a HV divider chain, consisting of 4 resistors in parallel (as
a redundancy to allow stable operation if a resistor fails). Each resistor (1 GΩ) will be mounted in the low
electric ﬁeld region between the inner surface of the Cu corner piece and the PTFE corner piece.

The side boundaries of the active volume are deﬁned by an octagonal assembly of sixteen ﬂat, highly-
reﬂective PTFE panels (each 119 cm high and 120 cm wide when cold). Eight PTFE panels form an octagon
that is stacked onto another PTFE octagon (see Fig. 46). The PTFE will shrink by ∼ 2 % linearly when
cooled from room temperature to LAr temperature and will be taken into account when the ﬁnal materials
selection has been made and exact coeﬃcients of thermal expansion are measured. The use of the Cu pins
and corner pieces to hold the rings in place allows for the rings and PTFE panels to shrink concentrically
relative to each other, maintaining the uniform electric ﬁeld at LAr temperature. The Cu corner pieces and

66

pins require high machining precision and will thus be fabricated using Wire EDM techniques. The Cu tubing
will be rolled using a ﬂat rolling mill with a custom proﬁle.

The top boundary of the active volume, shown in Fig. 47, is given by a 15 mm thick ﬂat acrylic diving bell
coated with a thin ITO layer at the bottom. The bottom ITO layer serves as the anode for the LAr TPC.
The potential of the anode layer is ﬁxed at ground. An extraction ﬁne wire grid sitting 3 mm below the liquid
surface isolates the higher extraction and electroluminescence ﬁelds from the lower uniform drift ﬁeld in the
LAr TPC bulk volume. The extraction wire grid potential is ﬁxed at −3.8 kV to provide strong electric ﬁeld
in the gas region with nearly 100 % extraction eﬃciency of electrons from the LAr into the gas phase. The
liquid level is controlled by a diving bell system similar to that used in DarkSide-50. An array of PT-100
heaters will be used to uniformly boil oﬀ LAr. The resulting gas will be used to feed the diving bell to form
the gas pocket, and done in such a way as to prevent gas bubbles from disturbing the LAr surface. The
height of the lip of the anode acrylic diving bell deﬁnes the 7 mm-thick gas pocket.

The extraction wire grid employs 50 µm stainless steel wires placed with a pitch of 3 mm in a linear
parallel grid. Wires will be mounted onto a 325 cm diameter stainless steel frame. Each end of each wire
will be wrapped around a stainless steel post at the desired tension using a dedicated wire winding machine.
The stainless steel posts are mounted into precisely machined holes in the stainless steel frame. The wires
are guided using precision Wire-EDM machined grooves. The tension of each wire must compensate for the
deﬂection due to its weight and electrostatic attraction between the extraction grid and anode. For a vertical
deﬂection <1 mm the tension on each wire is required to be 1 N. The grid frame has an inner octagonal shape,
an outer circular shape and an L-shaped cross-section to enhance its rigidity and to keep its maximum radial
deformation to <1 mm. The vertical deﬂection requirement of <1 mm and a pitch of 3 mm for the extraction
wire grid ensure the uniformity of the electroluminescence ﬁeld near the gas-liquid interface. Fig. 47 shows
the anode region with SiPM motherboards and the support structure, which allows thermal shrinkage during
cool down and expansion during warming up. Fig. 48 shows the full anode assembly of the TPC. The density
of acrylic is slightly less than that of LAr, hence the anode window is subject to bowing upward when
immersed in LAr, due to buoyancy. In addition, the displaced argon within the gas pocket translates directly
into a force being exerted upward on the lower surface of the anode window, resulting in additional buoyancy.
To maintain uniformity of the S2 response, the anode window is kept ﬂat within <0.1 mm using a set of 24
Cu pillars, each approximately 3 mm in diameter.

During cool down and warm up, the acrylic anode window and its supporting Cu pillars might have
relative shifts due to diﬀerential thermal contraction. To prevent possible mechanical issues, the anode
assembly is designed so that the Cu pillars will be co-moving with the anode. A similar-thickness acrylic
plate (coherent plate) is located on top of the copper mechanical support structure such that the coherent
plate and the anode shrink at the same rate. This coherent plate is constrained in the vertical direction on
the copper plate near each pillar so that the coherent plate will not bow-up. The Cu pillars supporting the
anode are ﬁxed to the coherent plate. The Cu pillars must also be placed in between the densely packed SiPM
motherboards. At the DarkSide-20k scale, the Cu pillar near the edge of the anode will shrink about 2 cm
towards the center, hence the SiPM mother boards must also co-move with the rest. This can be realized
by mounting the SiPM Cu motherboards also on the acrylic coherent plate. Even within the dimensions of
the motherboards, the four ﬁxture bolts (ﬁxed on the Cu motherboard and incurring less shrinkage related
to that of acrylic) will have relative motion with respect to the acrylic. This design already implements a

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

solution that allows for such relative motion. The design of the cathode does not call for the supporting
pillars and hence makes the handling of the thermal contraction is much easier to deal with. The baseline
design calls for the cathode window to be made slightly larger than the interior of the LAr TPC, which after
cool down would then match the LAr TPC dimensions. To make sure the window does not slide, relative to
the TPC, at least one point would be held in place, thus controlling the direction of the thermal contraction.

The Cu pillars are intentionally lengthened to provide a 5 cm long liquid region above the anode acrylic
window. In DarkSide-50, the top PMT array was kept very close to the fused silica anode assembly. This
reduced sharing of the S2 light among the 3 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs, degrading the x-y position resolution. The length of
5 cm for the oﬀset of the top photosensor array away from luminescence region is driven by size of each SiPM
tile which is about 50 × 50 mm2. A similar approach is used in liquid xenon dark matter experiments such as
LUX, LZ and Xenon1T [51,60,58], where position resolution of less than 1 cm is achieved or expected using
3 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs.

Given the design drift ﬁeld of 200 V/cm over the drift length of 238 cm and the additional voltage required
to generate the extraction and luminescence ﬁelds, the total voltage between anode and cathode will be
−52 kV. The HHV will be delivered through the top ﬂange of the cryostat by a custom-made high voltage
feedthrough (HVFT), similar in design to that used in DarkSide-50. The HVFT design and fabrication
follow a well established and reproducible procedure developed over many years at UCLA and is dependent
on low-radioactivity materials: an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) tube serving as the
insulator, stainless steel used for the outer grounding tube and inner conductor core, and an integral, conﬂat-
ﬂange-mounted custom connector terminating the cable connecting to the external power supply. The outer
grounding tube is extended deep into the LAr region to reduce ﬁeld in GAr region and chance of LAr boiling
at its termination. Below the ending of the outer grounding tube, the UHMWPE tube and inner conductor
core continue and are connected to the cathode guard ring. The UHMWPE tube will be sized to withstand
>100 kV and minimize the electric ﬁeld at its outer surface, which will be grooved to reduce charge transfer
due to charge buildup. Earlier versions of this HVFT have been tested well beyond the required −52 kV and
operated successfully in DarkSide-10, DarkSide-50 and the DUNE 35 t prototype, without any operational
diﬃculty. Fig. 49 shows a picture of a prototype feedthrough tested up to −150 kV.

All metal pieces, stainless steel and Cu, that are exposed to electric ﬁelds will be designed without sharp
edges and their surfaces will be additionally smoothed using various existing techniques such as optical
quality mechanical polishing, electropolishing, chemical etching, and conditioning. Detailed electrostatic and
mechanical studies of the all TPC subsystems will be performed. Scaled-down versions of the parts of these
systems will be tested in the LAr R&D setups at various institutions within the collaboration and in an
integrated test of all HV and electric ﬁeld systems in the LAr TPC prototype (see Sec. 8).

Fig. 50. Left: A single SQB (see text). Right: A single TRB (see text). SQBs and TRBs are assemblies of tiles
serving as building blocks of the photon readout planes.

7.4 Light Readout

Densely packed arrays of SiPMs above the anode acrylic window and below the cathode acrylic window fully
cover the top and bottom faces of the LAr TPC active volume, to detect both the S1 and S2 signals with high
eﬃciency. The top and the bottom photon readout assemblies consist of 2605 photon detection channels each.
A single readout channel consists of a 50 × 50 mm2 SiPM tile assembly containing an appropriate number
of individual SiPMs joined together to form a single light sensing unit. The SiPM tiles are used to form two
larger basic mechanical units called the SQuare Board (SQB) and the TRiangular Board (TRB), as shown
in Fig. 50. The SQB and TRB have the same edge size of 25 cm. The SQB and TRB are then used to form
the full readout octagonal planes. The total number of photon readout channels (top and bottom) is 5210.
5210 channels require careful routing of all signal and power cables. The concept will be similar to that
implemented in DarkSide-50, where cables from the bottom of the TPC are grouped and guided with vertical
PTFE panels, with the cables lined between the PTFE panel and the cryostat wall to prevent HV issues
near the cathode region. These cables then join the cables from the top readout array to form a single bunch
which is fed-through out of the cryostat, the LSV and ﬁnally the WCV using a single tube. The path of the
single tube from inside the cryostat to outside of the water tank is important, and must be made such that
the out going gas of the gas puriﬁcation loop passes through this tube and hence ﬂushes out any impurities
resulting from the outgassing of the cables.

Based on the previous experience of DarkSide-50 in optimizing light collection, the PTFE panels will be
2.5 cm thick and coated on the inside surface with a 200 µg/cm2 TPB layer [70]. The 15 mm thick anode
and cathode acrylic windows have better than 90 % optical transparency. The thickness of ITO ﬁlms will be
15 nm as in DarkSide-50, for an estimated optical transparency of 98 % [75]. The inner surface of the acrylic
plates will be coated with TPB over the ITO. The extraction grid optical transparency is estimated to be
98 %.

Optical MC studies using the full DarkSide-20k geometry and the G4DS simulation framework developed
for DarkSide-50 have been performed to estimate the expected S1 and S2 light yield. This is detailed in
Sec. 14.

7.5 Performance

The electrostatic ﬁeld of the LAr TPC is studied by ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) using the COMSOL Mul-
tiphysics software. The simulation was ﬁrst performed for the Prototype TPC, introduced in Sec. 8, which
is just a scaled-down version of DarkSide-20k with the same electrostatic features. As shown in Fig. 51, the
geometry of the LAr TPC, including all relevant components, is simpliﬁed by the 2D approximation with co-
ordinates of r and z. With the same operation conﬁgurations as DarkSide-20k, the drift ﬁeld in the simulation
is tuned to 200 V/cm and extraction (electroluminescence) ﬁeld is tuned to 2.8 kV/cm (4.2 kV/cm). Since in
the prototype the drift length is scaled down to 58 cm, the number of ﬁeld shaping rings is reduced to 28.
All shaping rings are evenly placed with vertical pitch of 2 cm, and between every two adjacent ﬁeld shaping
rings a set of 4 resistors are connected in parallel to form 1 GΩ. In order to eliminate eﬀects of extraction
ﬁeld leakage, Rg, the ﬁrst 4 parallel resistors in the divider chain, are tuned to have a total resistance of
0.225 GΩ.

horizontal axis r and vertical axis z, in units of millimeters. Contours represent equipotential lines with the color
bar on the right side showing the potential in units of volts, and streamlines represent the ﬁeld lines inside the
ﬁeld cage. Left: Untuned Rg = 1 GΩ for desired ﬁeld condition of 200 V/cm for the drift ﬁeld and 4.2 kV/cm for
the electroluminescence ﬁeld. Field lines are distorted near the extraction grid; Middle: Tuned Rg = 0.225 GΩ
for 200 V/cm drift ﬁeld and 4.2 kV/cm electroluminescence ﬁeld. Field lines are much more uniformly distributed.
Right: Tuned Rg = 0.225 GΩ for a quite undesired ﬁeld condition of 50 V/cm for the drift ﬁeld and 6 kV/cm for the
electroluminescence ﬁeld to illustrate the dramatic eﬀect of diﬀerent ﬁeld conditions on the drift ﬁeld uniformity.

Comparing the left and middle plots in Fig. 51, it is clear that the uniformity of the drift ﬁeld is enhanced
by this tuning. As varying either drift or extraction (electroluminescence) ﬁeld strength will aﬀect the
uniformity of drift ﬁeld as well, simulations are also carried out to study how large the eﬀect is. It was
found that with Rg set at the tuned value, the distortion of drift ﬁeld lines is acceptable with the drift ﬁeld
strength set at 100, 300, and 400 V/cm while the electroluminescence ﬁeld remained ﬁxed at 4.2 kV/cm,
and the electroluminescence ﬁeld set at 3, 5 and 6 kV/cm while the drift ﬁeld strength remained ﬁxed at
200 V/cm. Only with the drift ﬁeld strength set at 50 V/cm while electroluminescence ﬁeld remained at
4.2 kV/cm, do the drift ﬁeld lines start to be noticeably distorted. A combination of 50 V/cm drift ﬁeld and
6 kV/cm electroluminescence ﬁeld is also simulated to compare with the desired ﬁeld condition, illustrating
what a quite undesired ﬁeld condition looks like, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 51.

Based on this study, the resistance of each set of resistors in the chain is determined, and this conﬁguration
is set as the baseline design. In addition, since the TPC is designed as octagonal instead of circular, besides
the simulations described above which are performed using a radius normal to the PTFE panels, another
simulation was run in which the radius of the cylinder is set at the corner-to-corner width of the octagon
and compared. The two simulations show a consistent electrostatic ﬁeld distribution inside the TPC for all
the conﬁgurations described above, which shows that the 2D approximation is valid for this study. To verify
that the uniformity of the ﬁeld lines is still suﬃcient when scaling the geometry back up to that required for
the DarkSide-20k TPC, but still using the tuned values of the resistors and ﬁelds, the same FEA analysis
as above was carried out for the full scale geometry. The results of the COMSOL simulation are shown in
Fig. 52, with the same visual representation used in the previous ﬁgures. As is seen in this ﬁgure, the drift,
extraction and electroluminescence ﬁelds all remain uniform, throughout the entire active volume of the
DarkSide-20k LAr TPC.

The bowing of the anode acrylic window is studied via a FEA analysis in order to optimize the thickness
of the anode (as thin as possible for neutron thermalization) and minimize the deformation of the anode
face (for S2 uniformity). Fig. 53 shows the results of a 15 mm thick acrylic anode with a 7 mm gas pocket.
Supporting Cu pillars must be placed every 500 mm over the anode window to keep the gas pocket thickness
variation to <0.1 mm. As a comparison, in an anode assembly with no Cu pillars, the anode center will bow
up more than 1 cm.

7.6 Assembly and Installation

Within the design of the infrastructure, it is anticipated that the WCV water tank itself will serve as a
radon-free clean room for assembly and installation of both the LSV and the LAr TPC detector. The main

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

ﬂange of the LSV will be located on the bottom, and so the LAr TPC will be assembled on the ground
ﬂoor, then lifted up into the LSV and placed in the desired position. The fundamental assembly steps for
the LAr TPC will be:

1. Independently assemble the top SiPM array, bottom SiPM array and ﬁeld cage;
2. From bottom to top, assemble the bottom SiPM array, cathode acrylic plate, ﬁeld cage, extraction

grid, acrylic diving bell and top SiPM array onto the bottom Cu plate of the LAr TPC;

3. Hang the bottom Cu plate of the LAr TPC from the top ﬂange of cryostat, and level the TPC relative

to the cryostat;

4. Connect all the cables, insulated wires and optical ﬁbers to the corresponding feedthroughs, check the

conductivity and insulation;

5. Connect all the tubes and pipes inside the cryostat;
6. Close inner vessel and outer vessel of the cryostat successively, performing a helium leak check after

each step;

7. Perform comprehensive signal check for all the cables and wires;
8. Lift up the cryostat and place it into the LSV at the desired position, pre-level the cryostat and make

all necessary connections.

8 DarkSide-Proto

8.1 Introduction and Requirements

The collaboration will beneﬁt greatly from experience gained with DarkSide-50, however, DarkSide-20k will
be more than two orders of magnitude larger in size and will use new technologies. Therefore the collaboration
plans to build a prototype detector of intermediate size, DarkSide-Proto, incorporating the new technologies
for their full validation. The choice of the ∼1 t mass scale allows a full validation of the technological choices
for DarkSide-20k.

The construction, operation, and commissioning of DarkSide-Proto will allow validation of the major
innovative technical features of DarkSide-20k, including the mechanical and cryogenic design and the inte-
gration of the custom photodetector modules and the full read-out electronics and data acquisition chain. It
is expected that the developments in the diﬀerent WGs preparing technology for DarkSide-20k will proceed
at diﬀering paces, due to diﬀerent constraints and the nature of their activities. The plan for DarkSide-Proto,
in each of its phases, will be based on the status and progress of each sub-system.

It is anticipated that the prototype will evolve as elements of the DarkSide-20k technologies are incor-
porated as they become available and usable, i.e. interface-able to the rest of the chain even with reduced
functionality or containing still-developing technology. DarkSide-Proto is not intended to replace validation
and tests made in laboratories, but rather to complement them. The merit of such an approach is to identify
sooner rather than later issues related to functionality and performance that might be revealed only during
and after integration. It will also help to develop a better view of the overall project time-line and of the
resources needed, both human and ﬁnancial, to verify the production readiness of the diﬀerent institutions
and to help the integration of the various teams working on the diﬀerent DarkSide sub-systems. For this
reason, DarkSide-Proto is scheduled during the ﬁrst years of the project.

The DarkSide-Proto LAr TPC must respond to a stringent set of requirements. In particular, it must:
Proto-i Be built on a scale suﬃcient to test the full capabilities of the DarkSide-20k cryogenics system;
Proto-ii Employ materials with the same performance in LAr as those chosen for the DarkSide-20k;
Proto-iii Enable employment of large area densely packed custom photosensors array providing high

photocathode coverage and high S1 light yield;

Proto-iv Enable employment of large scale coated acrylic windows for deﬁning active LAr volume and

providing support for thin ﬁlm transparent electrodes;

Proto-v Enable employment of large area PTFE panels structure as light reﬂector, electric insulator

and holding structure for Cu ﬁeld cage;

Proto-vi Enable employment of large-area ﬁne pitch wire extraction grid and provide drift, electrolu-

minescence ﬁeld and gas pocket thickness uniformity for high resolution of S2 signals;

Proto-vii Allow for an integrated test of the HV and electric ﬁeld systems of DarkSide-20k;
Proto-viii Verify x − y position resolution to be on the order of, or better than, 10 mm;
Proto-ix Verify coherent co-moving of all LAr TPC subsystems together during the detector cool down.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

Fig. 54. 3D drawing of the DarkSide-Proto LAr TPC, shown inside the cryostat.

The full prototype program is broken into three separate phases, with the ﬁrst set to start at the beginning
of 2018 and the ﬁnal phase being completed during the second half of 2019. The three separate phases will
consists of:
Proto 0: Test of cryogenic system concept at the test site; identiﬁcation and preparation of full readout

and DAQ of 50 pre-production PDMs;

Proto I: Design, construction and assembly at test site of cryostat and LAr TPC equipped with 50 pre-
production PDMs; assembly, commissioning, and operation of full read-out and DAQ for 50 PDMs;
Proto II: Assembly and commissioning of full system, including 400 ﬁrst production PDMs; full readout

and DAQ operational; evolution towards ﬁnal conﬁguration.

8.2 Prototype Design Overview

The prototype TPC and cryostat are a down-scaled version of the corresponding DarkSide-20k systems.
The choice of the size has been driven by the requirement of a minimal conﬁguration TPC with the same
electrostatic features of the DarkSide-20k TPC, large enough to validate the mechanical choices for the
modular SiPM assembly concept and allowing for a full functionality test of the DarkSide-20k gas and liquid
recirculation system. Fig. 54 shows a 3D representation of the DarkSide-Proto LAr TPC and its cryostat.

DarkSide-Proto will use the ﬁnal cryogenic system of DarkSide-20k, but without the recovery tanks. All
elements required for the DarkSide-Proto cryogenics, shown in Fig. 55, are identical to those of the cryogenics
of DarkSide-20k, shown in Fig. 9. The recirculation rate will be 500 std L/min, with the system as shown in
Fig. 55. Crucial elements and features that can be tested include:

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

1. New upgraded argon condenser, heat exchanger and the 500 std L/min gas pump;
2. Fast drain recovery and heat recovery systems;
3. Functionality and stability of controls and the TPC level control loop;
4. System safety during power failure;
5. 500 std L/min puriﬁcation ﬂow rate.

The baseline option for a low-background structural material for the cryostat remains stainless steel: the
plan is to build a stainless steel cryostat to test the cooling and recirculation system during the ﬁrst phase.
But since the cryostat is one of the major contributors to the neutron background budget in DarkSide-20k,
it is also planned to explore titanium as a possible alternative for the ﬁnal vessel. Recent studies performed
within the DarkSide Collaboration have shown that ULR titanium could be used as a low-background
structural material, with mechanical strength better than industrial titanium and close to the mechanical
properties of stainless steel. The plan illustrated in Sec. 5.5 is to develop ULR titanium from the raw material
to the industrial scale. This development will be validated by the production of a second DarkSide-Proto
cryostat in radiopure titanium, thus allowing for the accurate test of all the mechanical features as well as

for the validation of the construction process, including laser- or electron-beam welding of titanium sheets
and rods to build the inner vessel, the outer vessel, and their ﬂanges.

The outer diameter of the inner and outer vessels of the cryostat for the prototype would be 1210 mm
and 1010 mm, respectively. With a choice of a 5 mm for the wall thickness of both vessels, results of the ﬁnite
element analysis for the thermal and mechanical loads, including the weight of the TPC has been performed
in Rome, indicate that the same design is viable for both stainless steel and titanium as construction materials
(for titanium, standard mechanical characteristics were used, corresponding to sample VT1-0 in Table 4).
A ﬁnal validation of the design is necessary in order to match the mechanical properties of the actual ULR
Titanium and of its welds, whose precise characterization is currently undergoing in Milano. The stainless
steel version of the cryostat would weight 600 kg, while the titanium version is about 340 kg. Eﬀorts to
optimize the design for even lighter cryostast are ongoing. Fig. 56 shows a 2D drawing of the cryostat
that will be used for the prototype detector, while Fig. 57 shows the results of the ﬁnite element analysis
calculation of mechanical stress performed for the titanium cryostat.

The TPC for DarkSide-20k will be based on the DarkSide-50 TPC design with several major modiﬁca-
tions. The major change is related to the proposed use of SiPM tiles instead of PMTs. Another important
change is the geometry of the active volume, changing from cylindrical to an octagonal prism. In addition the
anode, cathode and extraction grids are of new concept. Finally, the larger TPC also requires new mechanical
designs.

Fig. 58 shows a 3D drawing of the prototype LAr TPC. The minimal conﬁguration needed in order to
validate the overall choices for mechanics is based on an active volume deﬁned by an octagonal prism, with
the base edge deﬁned by the size of a SQB size (25 cm). The drift length is 58 cm.

The top and bottom boundaries of the active volume are two acrylic planes of the same thickness, coated
and mounted as in the DarkSide-20k LAr TPC, acting as anode and cathode. The extraction grid is also
scaled down in diameter from the ﬁnal detector one, but with the same wire size and pitch. As stated in
Sec. 7, the desired extraction (electroluminescence) ﬁeld is 2.8 kV/cm (4.2 kV/cm), and the prototype will
have the same value for the potential at grid, since it has the same design as DarkSide-20k, with 3 mm LAr

extraction ﬁeld region and 7 mm GAr electroluminescence region. With a drift ﬁeld of 200 V/cm over the
drift length, the total voltage between anode and cathode will be −15 kV.

In order to achieve exactly the same electrostatic conﬁguration as in the ﬁnal detector, the number of
ﬁeld shaping rings in the TPC is reduced to 28. All shaping rings are evenly placed with vertical pitch of
2 cm, and between every two adjacent shaping rings 4 resistors of 4 GΩ are connected in parallel to form a
1 GΩ equivalent resistance. The resistance between the topmost shaping ring and the extraction grid, Rg, is
tuned to 0.225 GΩ, formed also by 4 resistors (900 MΩ each), in order to eliminate the eﬀect of extraction
ﬁeld leakage. A complete study of the electrostatic ﬁeld in the prototype TPC was reported and discussed
in Sec. 7.5. The key parameters of the prototype TPC are summarized in Table 8.

8.3 Prototype PhotoElectronics and Readout

The top photon readout plane of the prototype is shown in Fig. 59. It consists of 185 photodetector modules
assembled into 5 SQBs and 4 TRBs. The bottom plane is similarly equipped with 185 modules for a total
of 370 channels to be readout.

For the initial implementation in phase Proto I, 50 tiles and PDMs will be available, part of the DarkSide-20k

pre-production. The tiles will be arranged on the cathode and anode to provide a uniform but incomplete
coverage of the area. The tiles will be mounted on PDMs, such as to provide the ﬁrst stage of pre-ampliﬁcation

and of signal transmission through the cryostat penetration. The readout of the ﬁrst 50 PDMs will be based
on a prototype receiver board under development that includes a diﬀerential receiver, an optimal ﬁlter shaper,
a signal discriminator, and an output to be fed to a digitizer. It is planned to use 250 MHz digitizers and a
majority trigger as done in DarkSide-50.

Once the ﬁrst prototypes of the ﬁnal electronics and DAQ chain will be available, the DarkSide-Proto
detector will be equipped with them, in order to estimate their full performance for key parameters (e.g.
zero suppression, software/advanced trigger algorithms, online DSP for timing) also in comparison with the
response of the well known DarkSide-50 system.

For the ﬁnal implementation in phase Proto II, 400 tiles will have been produced as part of the ﬁrst
DarkSide-20k production, allowing for a full coverage of the readout planes. Readout of the fully equipped
DarkSide-Proto will only be possible using the ﬁnal electronics and DAQ chain.

8.4 Infrastructure

The infrastructure required to install and test the DarkSide-Proto LAr TPC has minimal requirements:
1. A small, soft-wall and HEPA ﬁlter class-1000 clean room;
2. N2 & LN2 to cool and liquefy the argon target;
3. Pressurized N2 or air for the actuation of the pneumatic valves of the DarkSide-Proto the gas panel;
4. Ar gas to ﬁll the 1-tonne prototype cryostat;
5. Electrical power;
6. Chilled water;
7. An overall footprint of 5 × 5 m2 with height of 5 m.

The assembly of the DarkSide-Proto LAr TPC will proceed, as much as possible, following the sequence
and approach developed and foreseen for the DarkSide-20k, such as to validate (or modify, where necessary)
the DarkSide-20k assembly plan. The plan for DarkSide-Proto is to break the operations into three distinct
steps, the ﬁrst of which will test the cryogenics system along with the DarkSide-Proto cryostat. A second

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

77

phase will include the DarkSide-Proto TPC inside the cryostat, instrumented with a limited number of
PDMs. The third and ﬁnal phase will have the TPC fully instrumented with the total 370 PDM channels.

9 Veto Detectors: LSV and WCV

9.1 Introduction

Nuclear recoils induced by single neutron scatters are indistinguishable from WIMP interactions. Even the
large size of the LAr TPC does not allow a ﬁducial volume completely shielded from neutron-induced back-
grounds. External passive shielding provides protection against neutrons from outside the TPC (cosmogenic
or radiogenic from Hall C), but not from neutrons from the components of the TPC itself. Neutron induced
recoils will be suppressed using a liquid-scintillator neutron veto [132] (LSV), a separate detector surround-
ing the TPC in which the neutrons from both internal and external sources are detected with very high
eﬃciency, and the corresponding recoil events in the LAr TPC are identiﬁed and rejected. In addition to
removing neutron backgrounds, the LSV also provides in situ measurements of the neutron backgrounds,
allowing for reliable predictions of the number of neutron-induced recoils expected in the data sample to be
made. It also has a substantial eﬃciency for detecting γ-rays from the TPC and cryostat.

To lower the background rate in the LSV in order to allow as low an energy threshold as possible for
eﬃcient neutron-detection, additional shielding is required surrounding the LSV. The LSV will be surrounded
by a large tank of ultra-pure water, instrumented as a Cherenkov detector to veto cosmic rays, the Water
Cherenkov Veto (WCV). This layered veto concept has been used very successfully in DarkSide-50 [70,71,
133].

Neutrons that enter the LAr TPC come primarily from four sources:

1. Radioactivity in the environment outside the detector;
2. Cosmogenic interactions due to cosmic ray muons;
3. Spontaneous ﬁssion reactions in the detector materials;
4. (α,n) reactions in the detector materials.

Neutrons from the ﬁrst two sources are suppressed by the shielding and signals generated by the veto
detectors. Fission reactions that produce neutrons often generate multiple neutrons and high energy gamma-
rays, signiﬁcantly increasing the probability of multiple coincident interactions in either the LAr TPC or in
the neutron veto. This leaves (α,n) neutrons as the most challenging type of neutron to veto, and much of
the design is targeted around vetoing this class of neutrons with high eﬃciency.

(α,n) neutrons are produced by the alpha decays of radioisotopes in the detector materials, in particular
by the 238U, 235U, and 232Th decay chains. Cross sections for (α,n) reactions result in a neutron yield
usually between 10−5 to 10−7 neutrons per equilibrium decay of the entire chain, with light elements giving
the highest yields. (α,n) yield is strongly dependent on the α energy, making the lower sections of the 238U
and 232Th decay chains particularly important. This has serious implications for the DarkSide-20k materials
assay campaign, discussed in Sec. 13.

It is planned to use a liquid scintillator doped with an isotope with a high cross section for thermal
neutron capture. In DarkSide-50 this isotope was 10B, accomplished by a solution of 1,2,4-TriMethylBenzene
(PseudoCumene or PC) as solvent and 2,5-DiPhenylOxazole (PPO) as ﬂuor mixed with TriMethylBorate
(TMB) [70,71,133]. The use of this mixture is the baseline solution thanks to the successful experience gained
in operating DarkSide-50. However, the collaboration is aware of the safety concerns related to the handling
of large amount of PC and TMB and for this reason alternative options are presently under investigation,
as detailed in the next section.

Neutrons can be detected by exploiting two signals, usually deﬁned as prompt and delayed signals.
The prompt signal is produced during the thermalization of the neutrons. Neutrons lose their energy by
scattering oﬀ the nuclei of the scintillator, in particular hydrogen. Protons that are scattered by neutrons
produce scintillation light. The scintillation light of the protons, although heavily quenched, can be detected
by the PMTs. The thermalization of the neutrons is a fast process, usually contained in a narrow time
window of a few hundred ns with respect to the scattering on argon, therefore a very low threshold can be
used in a narrow prompt window.

The delayed signal is due to the neutron capture. The thermalized neutron can capture on various isotopes
in the scintillator. 10B, with a natural abundance of 20 %, is one of the isotopes with the highest thermal
neutron capture cross section, 3840 barn. The time scale and the relative probability of capture in boron,
hydrogen, or carbon nuclei depends on the amount on boron in the scintillator, with 10B dominant at all
but the smallest concentrations. The capture on 10B has two branches:

78

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

10B + n → 7Li + α (1775 keV) [6.4 %]
10B + n → 7Li∗ + α (1471 keV) [93.6 %]

(cid:44)→ 7Li∗ → 7Li + γ (478 keV).

The advantage of the 10B ﬁnal products is that the alpha and 7Li have very short range. Therefore if a
neutron is captured on 10B in the LSV, the reaction always produces some scintillation light. An important
feature of this signal is that it is independent of the energy of the neutron, meaning that a neutron that
has too low an energy to produce a detectable prompt signal may still produce a detectable delayed signal.
However, the light yield of alpha and 7Li nuclei is highly suppressed due to ionization quenching, causing
them to scintillate equivalent to a 50 to 60 keV electron. Detecting these reaction products therefore requires
a high light collection eﬃciency. The time scale of the delayed signal depends on the TMB concentration.
With a 50 % volume concentration, the neutron capture time is 2.2 µs, and ∼99.2 % of neutron captures
happens on 10B (the rest of the captures happens mostly on H), while with a 5 % concentration, the neutron
capture time is 22 µs and ∼92 % of neutron captures happens on 10B.

The delayed neutron tagging works in this way: a delayed veto window is opened in the LSV after each
event in the TPC. If a scintillation signal above a certain threshold is detected in the LSV during the delayed
veto window, the TPC event is discarded. The threshold must be low enough to reliably detect the signal
due to the alpha plus 7Li signal from the ground-state capture. The concentration of TMB drives the width
of the delayed veto window needed to reach the required veto neutron eﬃciency. The window width then
determines the fraction of the TPC events that will be accidentally discarded, due primarily to scintillation
from radioactivity in the LSV components. The requirements on the radioactive contamination in the LSV
are derived requiring an acceptable level of TPC event loss due to accidental background in the veto delayed
window.

9.2 Baseline Design

The geometry of the new WCV water tank has been optimized to provide the required amount of shielding
for the LSV and LAr TPC, but still ﬁt within the constraints of Hall C. The new stainless steel water tank
will have a cylindrical shape base 15 m in diameter and 7.5 m tall, with a dome-shaped ceiling having a radius
of 7.5 m. The total height of the water tank is 14.65 m. The new LSV will be 8.0 m in diameter, lined with
Lumirror reﬂective foil to increase light collection, and equipped with PMTs as was done in DarkSide-50.
However, the LSV will use 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) diameter PMTs, as described in the next section. The LSV will be ﬁlled
with the same boron-loaded liquid scintillator as was used in DarkSide-50, but with the TMB concentration
optimized for the new detector. The water tank will also be instrumented with 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs (same type as the
LSV) and lined with Tyvek to provide ample light collection. It will provide at least 3.5 m of active shielding
to the LSV in all directions.

To achieve at least the same light yield per unit of quenched energy inside the new LSV, the surface area
covered by PMTs will be increased with respect to what was used in DarkSide-50. This will compensate
for the increase in surface area and for the loss of light due to the moderate attenuation length (a few
to ten meters) of the scintillator cocktail. 130 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs will be used in the new LSV, leading to ∼13 %
photocathode coverage, more than suﬃcient to see the α following a neutron capture on 10B to the 7Li
ground state. 100 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs are suﬃcient to instrument the WCV. In total, the veto system will require
230 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs.

As anticipated, there are safety concerns related to the handling of large amount of TMB, due to its
very low ﬂash point, as well as PC, due to its low ﬂash point. In addition, TMB and PC have substan-
tial vapor pressures at room temperature, much higher than those of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and di-
isopropylnaphthalene (DIN). In reaction to the hypothesis that LNGS safety regulations could disfavor the
use of TMB and PC, the collaboration is actively investigating the possibility of using a scintillator with a
safe choice for the solvent and for the dopant enhancing the neutron capture rate and the associated signal.
Table 9 shows the solvents under consideration and a few selected physical properties of interest for
the selection. PC and TMB have been included for the purpose of comparison. The higher ﬂash point and
lower room temperature vapor pressure of DIN, LAB, and phenylxylylethane (PXE) makes them particularly
attractive as a choice for solvent; an additional beneﬁt is that they are less chemical aggressive than PC. LAB
is particularly interesting as it is gaining rapidly acceptance for use in many large volume detectors. The loss of

scintillation light yield when switching from a PC-based scintillator to a LAB-based scintillator is limited: the
yield reported for LAB+PPO+bisMSB is 70 % of that of PC+PPO [134] and it can be compensated, where
needed, by a modest increase in the number of PMTs. A recent development [135] identiﬁed the possibility
of loading organic liquid solvents with an organoboron compound of fairly limited safety and environmental
impact: ortho-carborane, (1,2-Dicarbadodecaborane(12), C2B10H12), a solid at room temperature with a
melting point of 260 ◦C, can be dissolved in LAB and also in DIN up to a concentration of 8.5 % in weight [136],
thus providing a safer alternative to TMB.

Another nucleus with large neutron capture cross section is 6Li. Indeed, the reaction with neutron pro-

duces charged particles with a very short range:

6Li + n → t (2.73 MeV) + α (2.05 MeV)

(3)

In this case, though, the higher energy of the α particle and the lower quenching of the triton result in
an electron equivalent energy from 400 to 500 keVee [137], nearly ten times as large as that for the lowest
energy α particle from capture on 10B cited above. A number of authors [137,138, 139], and among them
the PROSPECT Collaboration [140], studied in detail the possibility of loading organic liquid solvents
with aqueous solutions of 6LiCl, and their collective work has established a sound and safe avenue for the
development of 6Li-loaded organic liquid scintillators.

In order to study the backgrounds induced by neutrons originating from (α,n) reactions induced by the
radioactive contaminants of the TPC are generated and tracked using the Monte Carlo. The fraction of
these neutron events producing a signal in the LAr TPC and surviving a set of standard TPC cuts cannot
be distinguished by a true WIMP energy deposit without using the information of the veto detectors. The
energy deposit in the LSV is analyzed within a time window of about 7 τ ’s around the TPC signal (τ is the
thermal neutron capture time relative to the speciﬁc dopant of choice for the scintillator). The fraction of
events that are not tagged as neutrons as a function of the minimum threshold energy in the LSV represents
the residual background.

The comparison between the four scintillator options has to consider what threshold can be applied vs
deadtime. The short capture times of the two boron-based scintillators allow to lower the threshold down to
a few photoelectrons (6 PE in DarkSide-50): even in presence of 2.5 kBq of 14C, the deadtime introduced by
the veto will be <8%. For the other two scintillator options, the long capture times requires one to set the
threshold above the 14C Q-value (∼156 keV), where the neutron rejection eﬃciency is 3-4 times lower than
in the boron case.

Fig. 60 shows the upper limit on the residual background in a 100 t yr exposure, more about how this
analysis was performed in Sec. 14.2. The curves were obtained with a fraction of dopant that has already
been tested by other experiments.

Indeed, the option of loading the scintillator with orto-carburane turns out to be particularly appealing.
Further studies on the long term chemical and optical stability, chemical compatibility etc. are needed to
fully validate the choice.

9.3 PMTs

Geant4-based MC simulation studies demonstrated that the choice of the PMT diameter does not aﬀect
the physics performance of the LSV and WCV if the total photocathode coverage remains ﬁxed. The op-
tion to instrument the LSV and WCV with the same 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) MCP-PMTs developed for the JUNO neutrino
detector [141] has been decided as the baseline design. The choice of 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) MCP-PMTs allows to reduce the

number of cables, connectors, and electronics channels, containing the cost and simplifying the design and
construction of the experiment. The expected performance of the MCP-PMTs is summarized in Table 10.
The LSV will be equipped with 130 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs mounted on the stainless steel sphere; the WCV will be
equipped with 100 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) MCP-PMTs mounted to the inner surface of the water tank.

The MCP-PMTs of choice contain a double stage micro-channel plates (MCP) instead of a dynode chain.
A voltage divider is still necessary to provide the proper voltage to the front and back side of the MCP and
to the anode which collects the multiplied electrons. The socket with the voltage divider will be mounted on
the back side of the MCP-PMT and a single cable will run from this socket to the front end board located
outside the water tank. In the front end board the MCP-PMT signal will be decoupled from the HV bias.
The cables from both the LSV and WCV MCP-PMTs will be immersed in deionized water for many years.
Based on the Borexino and DarkSide-50 experience, cables and connectors designed for submarine operation
that have demonstrated proven success and ensure reliable working conditions will be used.

With this choice of PMTs, the signal from a single photoelectron (SPE) is expected to be a pulse of
∼10 mV in amplitude and 10 ns FWHM. Very preliminary simulations suggest that scintillation events with
energy higher than a few hundred keV are no longer in the SPE regime. Simulations also suggest that most of
the scintillation light is collected in 100 ns to 200 ns, with tails extending to 300 ns to 500 ns. The dark rate of
the LSV MCP-PMTs is expected to be 30 kHz at 300 K. Muons in the LSV produce a huge scintillation signal
that can last for several microseconds, blinding the LSV MCP-PMTs for this time. After-pulses typically
occur in a time window of 4.5 µs, with a probability which is <3 % per SPE of signal.

The MCP-PMTs must be encapsulated using low radioactivity materials that have long-term chemical
compatibility both with deionized water and with the organic liquid scintillator. The sealing solution already
used in the Borexino water Cherenkov muon veto [142], which showed high performance over many years,
will be adapted to these large MCP-PMTs . To be speciﬁc, the baseline design uses this style of encapsulation
for both the LSV and WCV PMTs.

Fig. 61. Design principle of the encapsulation of a MCP-PMT.

The PMTs will be fully encapsulated within a leak-tight case made of two pieces: 1. A truncated stainless
steel cone, shown in Fig. 61, that surrounds the PMT and the socket; 2. A thin, transparent, polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) window, conforming to the shape of the photocathode and covering it. The stainless
steel truncated cone has a ﬂange as shown in Fig. 61 with a diameter slightly larger than the maximum PMT
diameter. This ﬂange has an initial sealing surface on the side facing the MCP-PMT photocathode, allowing
the transparent window to make a leak-tight seal with the truncated cone. The stainless steel truncated cone
extends to host a second sealing surface, on the side opposite to the MCP-PMT photocathode, which anchors
the encapsulated MCP-PMT to the stainless steel sphere and makes a leak-tight seal with the sphere itself.
For the mounting of the MCP-PMTs in the WCV, the ﬁrst sealing surface is still used to ensure a leak-
tight seal between the stainless steel truncated and the thin transparent photocathode window, however,
the second sealing surface is not used, and so its bolt holes are instead used to mount the encapsulated
MCP-PMT to proper mechanical supports.

The stainless steel truncated cone is equipped, at the end opposite to the MCP-PMT photocathode, with
a submarine connector, mating to the submarine connector of the cable. As for the PMTs of the Borexino
water Cherenkov muon veto [142], the volume delimited by the stainless steel truncated cone and by the
thin transparent photocathode window will be ﬁlled by transparent mineral oil. The voltage divider will be
embedded within a proper resin, acting as another barrier between the water and the scintillator. Extensive
tests on prototypes and screening of materials to ensure both the chemical compatibility and the needed low
radioactivity will be performed: a baseline solution which consists of a replica of the materials in use for the
PMTs of the Borexino water Cherenkov muon veto [142] already exists.

Following the lead of Ref. [142], optical ﬁbers will be mounted such as to illuminate each MCP-PMT,
allowing to perform precise, periodic calibrations and monitoring of the MCP-PMTs gain. Fibers serving
the WCV MCP-PMTs will be spliced inside the water tank, and ﬁbers serving the MCP-PMTs of the LSV
will be spliced inside the stainless steel sphere, also following the lead of Ref. [142], such as to minimize
the number of ﬁber optic feedthroughs. All ﬁbers will be connected to a pulsed laser source with adjustable
power, eventually tuned to provide an illumination level equivalent to a fraction of PE per MCP-PMT per
pulse.

The terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld (TMF) causes the degradation of the characteristics of the large area PMTs
because of the deﬂection in the trajectories of the photoelectrons drifting from the photocathode to the ﬁrst
dynode. Trajectories of secondary electrons in the dynode chain can also be aﬀected, depending on the

orientation of the PMT relative to the TMF. The TMF eﬀects are increased with increased photoelectron
path length inside the PMT (longer path from the photocathode to the ﬁrst dynode). Photoelectrons are
defocused causing losses in collection eﬃciency on the ﬁrst dynode and degradation of gain at the ﬁrst
dynode, resulting in worse SPE resolution transit time spread. The TMF eﬀects increase with the increasing
size of the PMTs [143]. These eﬀect can be compensated by shielding the TMF in the entire detector, such
as by covering the entire detector with large Helmoltz coils, or by shielding the TMF locally, for example by
the use of µ-metal screens or cages. For PMTs with a classic dynode system, the eﬀects can also be reduced
by properly orienting the dynodes axis in a direction orthogonal to the TMF. The preferred option is the
use of µ-metal cages, in form of a hemispherical mesh of µ-metal wires placed in front of the MCP-PMT
photocathode. These hemispherical cages were already successfully applied to compensate the TMF for the
smaller (8 (cid:48)(cid:48)) PMTs in the DarkSide-50 experiment, and are being developed for use in JUNO.

Initial tests were performed using a Hamamatsu 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMT with a classic dynode system, covered by a
spherical cage composed by two hemispheres made by µ-metal mesh. Results are presented in the Table 11.
The relative PDE is the main parameter to check, normalized to the ﬁrst run performed in near-absence
of magnetic ﬁelds (TMF almost completely compensated). Data at 20 µT and 40 µT were collected with
the main dynode axis oriented in the direction parallel to the ﬁeld, which maximizes the magnetic ﬁeld
disturbance. Data for the TMF represent the average of random orientations of the PMT dynodes axis.
Blank runs with an ideal compensation of the TMF were performed throughout the experiment, to provide
a ﬁrst order assessment of possible statistical errors. As one can see from the table, the cage options provide
a satisfactory path towards the goal of containing the loss in PDE due to the TMF within 10 %.

While the baseline solution for shielding the veto PMTs from external magnetic ﬁelds is to used a µ-metal
cage, as was done for DarkSide-50 and is currently being developed for the 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs intended for JUNO,
another option is also under investigation. This second option consists of the use of µ-metal foil, which would
be rolled into a cone and wrapped around the bottom portion of the MCP-PMT. This solution would have
the advantage of eliminating the cage in front of the photocathode and the associated loss of light due to
the blockage by the mesh. Also, initial tests have shown that this solution can provide better shielding of
the external ﬁelds without the need for annealing the material, as is required for the µ-metal cages. This
option will also be studied in detail. A ﬁnal decision on the best solution will be made in advance of the time
required for production and delivery of the components.

9.3.1 PMTs Backup Solution

A back-up solution would be necessary if the JUNO PMTs were not able to be delivered on time or they did
not meet the requirements. The alternative option is that the same number of 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) Hamamatsu PMTs be
used, which have been used in past experiments and will also be used inside the JUNO detector to provide
improved timing resolution. The performance of the PMTs being developed for JUNO is set to match that
of the Hamamatsu PMTs in all but timing. The encapsulation developed for the 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) MCP-PMTs would
still be compatible for use with the 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) Hamamatsu PMTs, modulo the necessary mechanical adaptations.

9.4 LSV and WCV Front-End Electronics

The veto detectors’ front-end electronic system must be able to handle the LSV and WCV PMTs sig-
nals, extracting charge and time information. The baseline design follows that of the DarkSide-50 front-end
system [133], implementing diﬀerent modularity and a better mechanical arrangement. R&D is currently
underway to provide a prototype of the full system.

Fig. 62 shows the block diagram of the front-end electronics. Each PMT will be connected to the electronic
system with a single coaxial cable (RG213-like) used for both HV supply and analog signal collection (see

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

83

green box in Fig. 62). The HV bias will be provided by an external power supply (gray box, CAEN-SY127-
like) and will be decoupled from the signal with a simple RC network. The analog signal pulse will then be
ampliﬁed and discriminated (see cyan box in Fig. 62).

The speciﬁcations for the preampliﬁer are:

1. Bandwidth greater than 300 MHz;
2. Gain of 10 V/V;
3. Zin = 50 Ω;
4. SNR > 10.

The preampliﬁer output signal is output directly and also feeds a leading-edge discriminator with a
programmable threshold. Multiple discriminators feed a local veto digital control board (VDCB) and the
overall DAQ system, described in Sec. 11.

A highly modular design is proposed, in which 8 preampliﬁer-discriminator channels will be put on a
single printed circuit board (PCB) called the veto front end board (VFEB). The VFEB PCB dimensions
will be 233 × 160 mm2, a standard double Eurocard module. On this card, the input PMT signals come from
the crate backplane connectors (right side in the picture); the analog output signals will be put on the board
front panel to be easily connected to the external digitizers. The discriminator digital signals will be sent
to the backplane connectors to be handled by the VDCB. Moreover, pulses from four channels are summed
together providing additional information that can be used for coarse information about the energy of an
event. In total, two summed outputs will be available on the front panel. Up to 8 VFEBs will be housed in
a standard 19 (cid:48)(cid:48) 6-U crate having a modular unit of 64 channels.

The HV decoupling circuits will be implemented in a separate board, handling 8 channels, placed in the
rear part of the crate. There will be 8 HV decoupling circuits per crate. This will help a lot during system
setup and cabling: the PMTs’ RG213 cables (heavy and rigid) will be connected once to the system and
never touched again. Analog signals will be distributed to the VFEB via a dedicated backplane using tiny
U.FL connector coax cables (state of the art in the mobile phone era).

The low voltage power supply and the VDCB will also be housed in the crate. The VDCBs functions will

include:
1. VFEB parameter settings (On/Oﬀ, thresholds, etc.);
2. Slow control (measure of voltages, currents, temperatures, etc.);
3. Event counters (scalers);
4. Time-to-digital conversion (TDC) of discriminator signals;
5. Trigger logic.

The VDCB will be implemented using state-of-the-art ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA) compo-
nents: all logic functions are in a single chip, giving the ﬂexibility to change the operational code at any time
during the development process and also during the lifetime of the apparatus. The ﬁrmware upgrade can
also be done remotely, thus avoiding access of the board. TDCs with ns resolution, which is adequate for

veto PMT signals, can easily be implemented in the FPGA. Current R&D work is focusing on a commercial
ALTERA Cyclone IV device as the possible FPGA candidate for the VDCB implementation. The VDCB
will communicate to the control and DAQ systems using a high-speed serial standard interface like Fast
Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet, connected using CAT-6 copper cable or standard optical ﬁber.

In the current design of the veto detectors, the LSV and WCV together have 230 PMTs, so the electronic
front-end system will have only 4 crates. A small-scale, single-channel prototype has been developed to test
the performance of the preampliﬁer-discriminator channels and also the HV decoupling. All the functions
are implemented using oﬀ-the-shelf components.

10 Calibrations

10.1 Requirements

Calibration of the DarkSide-20k detectors are required to reach the physics goals of achieving a highly
sensitive, multi-year, background-free WIMP search. Calibrations range from low-level detector issues, such
as the single-photoelectron response of individual photosensors, to high-level physics issues like the acceptance
as a function of energy for nuclear recoils. Calibrations required include:
– Photosensor charge and time response;
– TPC and LSV scintillation light yield;
– Spatial uniformity of the TPC detector response;
– Pulse shape discrimination of nuclear and electron recoils;
– Neutron detection eﬃciency in the LSV;
– Stability of the detectors’ responses over time (TPC, LSV and WCV).
The combination of radioactive sources, neutron generators and light sources proposed here ensures a robust
calibration plan.

10.2 Overview

Laser calibrations, with laser pulses delivered through optical ﬁbers to the TPC, LSV and WCV (described
in the TPC and LSV sections) are used to tune and characterize the SiPM and PMT charge and time
response. Calibrations with gamma sources calibrate the TPC and LSV energy scales and the TPC position
reconstruction and resolution for surface background rejection. They also provide data for tuning the Monte
Carlo detector response modeling and track detector stability with time. Calibrations with neutron sources
verify the detector’s ability to detect WIMP-induced nuclear recoils and distinguish them from electron
recoils, along with measuring the eﬀectiveness of the veto detectors to identify and reject neutron-induced
nuclear recoils. Besides speciﬁc calibrations, neutron and gamma sources provide generally useful samples of
signal-like and background-like events. UV LED light calibration provides an alternative to sources in the
LSV and WCV and vastly extends the possible range of energy calibrations (100 keV to 100 MeV) by varying
the power output of the controllable LED and assuming that the number of emitted photons is proportional
to the energy of the simulated physics event).

The LAr TPC light yield in the 30 keVnr to 200 keVnr energy range of interest for WIMP scatters is
another key detector response. A distributed source of low energy electron recoils can be obtained by period-
ically introducing 83mKr into the active argon volume [144,145, 146,147]. This short-lived (τ =2.64 h) isotope
gives a mono-energetic peak from its near-coincident 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV conversion electrons, summing
to 41.5 keV [148]. 83mKr is conveniently obtained by milking a 83Rb (τ =124.4 day) electron capture (EC)
source connected to the gas system. Injection of the 83mKr is done through the recirculation system’s argon
return line. Such a source will be permanently installed in an accessible part of the external gas loop, as was
done for DarkSide-50, and can be replaced when necessary to compensate for its natural decay. The 83mKr
source will also allow the spatial dependence of the S1 and S2 scintillation responses to be studied in detail,
since the 83mKr will be injected into the LAr TPC at multiple points to avoid laminar ﬂow and give good
spatial distribution of the source throughout the LAr TPC volume.

A variety of neutron and γ-ray sources will be deployed within the LSV to calibrate the detectors.
DarkSide-50 used a vertical CALibration Insertion System (CALIS) to insert and position calibration sources
within the LSV through “organ pipes”: vertical pipes that penetrate the WCV, allowing access to the LSV.
Based on the success of CALIS in DarkSide-50, DarkSide-20k will use a similar system, modiﬁed for the
planned geometry. Such system gives ﬂexibility in the choice of calibration source and deployed position. At

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

the same time, such a system does involve direct contact with a fairly complex liquid scintillator mixed with
TMB, making the calibration campaigns elaborate in terms of planning, execution and duration.

For this reason, the collaboration has also envisioned two closed guideline systems, one for the LSV and
another for the TPC. The guideline systems consist of closed tubes that loop around the inner LSV wall and
outer cryostat wall for the TPC calibration. The tubes used have a small diameter to avoid shadowing eﬀects
and can accommodate only miniature radioactive sources. On the other hand, they allow calibration of the
TPC and LSV without any contact with the liquid scintillator, can be more eﬃcient (hence calibrations
could be done more frequently) and provide better localization of the deployed sources.

Calibrations with a neutron source are essential to determine and monitor the LSV neutron detection
eﬃciency and to measure the nuclear-recoil S1 pulse shape in the LAr TPC used in the background discrim-
ination. A conventional AmBe source has coincident high-energy gammas that allow event-by-event tagging
of neutron events in the LAr TPC by detecting these gammas in the LSV. However, coincidence high-energy
gammas interfere with measurements of the prompt neutron detection eﬃciency in the LSV. The DarkSide-50
collaboration has produced and employed an alternate (α,n) source based on 241Am and 13C, which is free
of these gammas. Both types of sources will be used.

Accurate absolute neutron detection eﬃciency measurements require a tagged neutron source with no
accompanying radiation. For this purpose, a customized 2D-2D tagged neutron generator based on the
Thermoscientiﬁc API-120 [149,150], which has already been procured for DarkSide-50, will be used. In
addition, a small, compact, battery operated pyro-electric neutron generator and a tagged 252Cf source are
under development.

10.3 Neutron Generators

10.3.1 Tagged neutron generator

Homeland Security applications of neutron imaging by the associated particle technique have led to com-
mercial availability of the Thermoscientiﬁc API-120 2D-2D generator. This reaction produces no penetrating
radiation in coincidence with the neutrons. The standard API-120 provides individually time- and direction-
tagged, monoenergetic neutrons at very high intensity (>107 n/s). The tagging is accomplished by detecting
the 3He from the neutron production reaction as it strikes an internal scintillator screen, using an external
multi-anode MCP-PMT closely coupled through a sapphire window. A custom version was developed by
Thermoelectron with neutron ﬂux limited to 104 n/s, in order to meet the local approval by LNGS radi-
ation safety regulations without having to seek national approval. The conﬁguration was also modiﬁed to
allow the device to ﬁt through the 6 (cid:48)(cid:48) ID organ pipe into the DarkSide-50 LSV. Neutron emission times are
tagged within about 1 ns and the emission angles within 40 mrad. This will allow the LSV neutron detection
eﬃciency to be thoroughly mapped out in position and direction.

10.3.2 Pyroelectric neutron generator

Pyroelectric crystals, such as LiNbO3 or LiTaO3, produce an electric ﬁeld up to 105 kV/cm, when exposed
to a temperature gradient. DarkSide collaborators have conﬁrmed experimentally that a setup with a 2 cm3
crystal installed in a stainless steel chamber with a residual gas pressure of about 1 µbar and grounded metal
target, generates X-rays with energy up to 100 keV. The same setup could be used to generate 2.45 MeV
neutrons if the target is deuterated and the residual gas is 2D. Thus, a pyroelectric neutron generators (PNG)
seems to be a promising tool for calibration of a LAr TPC and other low background detectors, because of
their On/Oﬀ mode of operation and the absence of radioactive materials. Such a controllable PNG will be
periodically deployed in the detector for the calibration of the detector response to neutrons.

The assembly which was used to demonstrate the PNG-generated X-rays consists of a LiTaO3 crystal,
and a stainless steel disk plate with tungsten W-tips welded to it, as shown in Fig. 63 (left). Fig. 63 (right)
illustrates the neutron generation process. A PNG prototype, shown in Fig. 64, is planned to be 50 mm to
70 mm in diameter, 50 mm to 70 mm long and have an expected neutron yield not less than 160 n/s.

10.4 Radioactive Sources

10.4.1 241Am13C Neutron Source

Neutron sources based on the 9Be(α,n)12C reaction have a large probability of producing 12C in the 4.4 MeV
excited state, due to the large Q value for this reaction. The resulting prompt 4.4 MeV γ-rays have been
found in DarkSide-50 to be a convenient trigger for study of neutron captures in the TPC which typically
occur microseconds after the neutrons thermalize. However, the necessary very high veto eﬃciency requires
that the prompt signals from the thermalization process also be detected with high eﬃciency. It turns out
that a source based on 13C(α,n)16O with α’s of less than 4 MeV still has usable neutron yield, but gives
essentially no excited 16O ﬁnal states and hence no prompt reaction γ-rays. The choice of 241Am as the α
source is almost unique in that it also guarantees very few (∼10−4 per α) nuclear γ-rays associated with
the α emission. 241Am does emit copious 60 keV gammas, but these are easily attenuated to the necessary
level by 2 mm of Pb. Such sources were independently developed by the Daya Bay experiment [151]. An
241Am13C source using 3.7 MBq of 241Am was assembled and successfully deployed in DarkSide-50, giving
a few neutrons per second and permitting studies of the thermalization signals. A new source with slight
improvements is envisioned.

10.4.2 AmBe neutron source

While the 241Am13C source represents the best choice for calibration of the LSV neutron detection eﬃciency,
interactions in the source holder and materials between the source and the TPC produced signiﬁcant electron
recoil background in the DarkSide-50 TPC, problematic for characterization of the nuclear recoils of argon
nuclei. The AmBe source was shown to be more suitable for this calibration. The 4.4 MeV γ-ray is promptly
emitted in the 9Be(α,n)12C nuclear reaction in about 60 % of cases. By tagging the 4.4 MeV γ-ray in the LSV

tungsten capsule of the custom made miniature AmBe source.

in a very tightly constrained time interval prior to the signal in the TPC, a very pure sample of nuclear recoils
is obtained. The AmBe calibration in DarkSide-50 provided the best available nuclear recoil calibration of
the DarkSide-50 TPC in situ, and was in excellent agreement with the nuclear recoil calibration from the
stand-alone SCENE experiment [77].

The main novelty planned for the AmBe calibration is a custom production of a miniature (a few mm)
AmBe source, since the typically available commercial sources cannot ﬁt within the planned narrow TPC and
LSV guide tube systems. The miniature AmBe source will rely on the procedure developed by the neutrino
group at the University of Alabama [152]. The group successfully fabricated an AmBe source with an outer
capsule dimension of just 2 mm in diameter and 7 mm long, with an activity of 50 neutrons per second using
1.9 MBq of 241Am. Fig. 65 shows the outer and inner source capsules. The inner capsule is made of tungsten
to eﬃciently suppress the 60 keV gamma emission from the 241Am. A very pure Be powder is mixed with
241Am high purity powder in an alcohol solution in a miniature test tube with a special micropipette and
then transferred into the tungsten capsule. After the alcohol evaporates, the procedure is repeated. In the
end, the mixture of AmBe is compressed with a wire for higher source activity. The wire is also used to seal
the tungsten capsule. The tungsten capsule is placed inside the stainless steel capsule and welded shut. The
source is then ready for certiﬁcation and use. The outside capsule has a threaded part to attach the source
to the rest of the calibration system.

10.4.3 Tagged 252Cf source

A tagged 252Cf spontaneous ﬁssion source (under development by DarkSide collaborators in Russia) provides
an interesting option for understanding the LSV neutron detection eﬃciency, by accessing locations otherwise
inaccessible to the API-120 2D-2D generator. Properties of 252Cf spontaneous ﬁssion (energy spectrum of
neutrons and gammas, mean number of neutrons per ﬁssion 3.756 ± 0.001) are well known and such type
of sources are widely used in neutron physics when studying materials with neutron diﬀraction and neutron
spectroscopy.

Tagging of the spontaneous 252Cf ﬁssion is achieved by a semiconductor surface-barrier Si detector. The
low activity (30 ﬁssions/s) sample of 252Cf is placed near the surface of the Si detector. Fission products
detected in the thin Si detector are separated by energy from alpha-particles as well as from gammas and
betas. The mean kinetic energy of the ﬁssion fragments is about 190 MeV, while the maximum energy of the
alphas is 6.7 MeV. So it is easy to identify ﬁssion and produce an external trigger for the main detector.

The total activity of the source (10 ﬁssions/s, 37.6 n/s and 316 alphas/s) is below the level which requires

special radioactive source certiﬁcate.

88

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

10.4.4 External Miniature γ-ray and Positron Sources

Three external gamma sources were used in DarkSide-50: 57Co, 133Ba, and 137Cs. In addition, a 22Na
positron source was used. The combination of these sources and the 39Ar available during the AAr run gave
an excellent calibration of the electron recoil f90 band, energy scale and provided data for the tuning of the
detector response in the Monte Carlo simulation. The gamma sources were chosen to span the energy range
of interest in combination with the distributed 83mKr source: 41.5 keV for 83mKr, 122 keV for 57Co, 356 keV
for 133Ba, and 662 keV for 137Cs. A similar set of sources, but miniature in size, is planned to be used within
the TPC and LSV guide tube systems. Source production procedures like the one used for the miniature
AmBe source production will be employed, except for replacing the inner tungsten capsule with one made
out of stainless steel.

10.4.5 Distributed 83mKr Source

Due to the nature of TPC operation, it is simply not possible to insert a solid source into the TPC active
volume. A mechanical delivery close to the TPC is possible but does not solve the uniformity issue due to the
large detector size. Uniformity of the response to gamma rays is not necessarily required, since the primary
and sole necessary calibration comes from the SCENE data and in situ calibration with AmBe, where the
response of LAr to nuclear recoils was very carefully characterized and calibrated against the response of
LAr to the monochromatic line resulting from the two EC in 83mKr. A careful mapping with gamma rays is
not one of the requirements of the experiment.

Monte Carlo studies of DarkSide-20k with G4DS show that the interaction length for gamma sources
spans from 5 cm for 57 Co to 9 cm for 137 Cs. While their interaction length will allow probing just the edge
of the LAr TPC, they can successfully be used (as in DarkSide-50) for MC simulation tuning and crosschecks
with the 83mKr calibration in the overlapping region. Finally, the main physics result of DarkSide-20k requires
careful calibration of the nuclear recoils response. Calibration of the electron recoils is simply instrumental
for the calibration of the nuclear recoils response, and the baseline solution relies on the use of 83mKr.

The monoenergetic decays of 83mKr, if distributed through the active volume of the TPC, can give a key
calibration point in the WIMP recoil energy region. The 3D reconstruction of events in the TPC allows a
full mapping of position-dependence of the light yield using this source as well. This means that, while broad
dissemination through the active volume is important, a uniform distribution is not required. The 83mKr
decays quickly (τ =2.64 h) to a stable nuclide and causes no long-term contamination or background to the
WIMP search.

The 83mKr source is based on the source used successfully in DarkSide-50. A tiny droplet of a solution of
83Rb (τ =124.4 day) is adsorbed into a piece of charcoal, which, after drying, is placed between two particulate
ﬁlters in a branch of the argon recirculation system which is normally isolated by valves and can separately
be pumped to vacuum. In DarkSide-50, an initial 8.5 kBq of 83Rb gave a 83mKr trigger rate of hundreds of
Hz, even though the ﬂow subsequently passed through a cooled radon trap. The impact of the colder radon
trap (see Sec. 5) will need evaluation.

In DarkSide-20k, the challenge will be to get the 83mKr broadly distributed in the 23 t active mass before
it decays. To further this, LAr will be returned to the TPC after repuriﬁcation via numerous tubes whose
endpoints will be distributed over the surface area of the TPC PTFE reﬂectors.

10.4.6 Distributed 220Rn Source

220Rn and its short-lived daughters produce several γ-rays, β’s, and α’s of various energies. This opens up a
possibility to use 220Rn as another distributed calibration source [153]. The source of 220Rn may be prepared
as an electroplated 228Th on stainless steel or copper. Enclosed in a small metal-sealed and vacuum-tight
volume equipped with a VCR/CF port it may be hooked up to the gas circulation system in a similar way
as the 83mKr source. The advantages of the 220Rn source are the following:
– 220Rn and its daughters are short-lived, the longest half-life in the chain is 10.6 h for 212Bi, therefore the

activity introduce into the detector will disappear after a few days;

– The high energy alphas appearing in the chain (6.05 MeV, 6.09 MeV, 6.29 MeV, 6.78 MeV, and 8.78 MeV);
– The coincident 220Rn-216Po and 212Bi-212Po decays will allow to study the homogeneity of the distributed
sources (aﬀect also 83mKr and the performance of the distribution system in the large LAr volume), and
possible LAr ﬂow patterns as well as potential “dead volumes” that are not aﬀected by the LAr circulation;

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

89

– Drift of the charged ions inside the LAr volume (interesting also with respect to Po isotopes from the

222Rn chain);

– Low-energy β’s appearing in the chain may be used for calibrations of the low-energy response of the

detector.
To avoid removal of the 220Rn source by the charcoal trap it should be by-passed during the calibration
run. Release of 220Rn from the source should be done in a way that avoids contamination of the detector
with residual 224Ra (half-life 3.6 day) or 228Th (half-life 1.9 yr). A similar risk exists for the 83mKr source,
but has been thoroughly mitigated and never observed.

10.5 Calibration Deployment Systems

10.5.1 LSV and TPC Guide Tube System

The LSV and TPC guide tube systems have been designed for simple, safe and eﬃcient calibration of the
LSV and TPC using miniature radioactive sources. They will allow deployment of the sources inside the
LSV without direct contact with the liquid scintillator, eliminating risks associated with it.

The TPC guide tube system will bring radioactive sources from the top of the WCV, through the water,
into the LSV, through the liquid scintillator, and then to locations along the cryostat exterior surface. The
sources will be delivered through an enclosed stainless steel tube coming vertically down from the top of
the water tank, passing by the cryostat wall and around its bottom. To avoid any possibility of the source
getting stuck in the detector, the enclosed tube will form a closed loop so that the sources can be pushed
down around the cryostat and then back up on the other end in the unlikely event that a source gets detached
from the guide wire.

The LSV guide tube system is conceptually the same, except that the guide tube inside the LSV will
be attached to the wall of the stainless steel sphere. Fig. 66 shows the conceptual path of the TPC and
LSV guide tube systems. The guide tubes will be 1.8 cm (0.75 (cid:48)(cid:48)) in diameter to minimize shadowing, dead
space and radioactive background coming from the stainless steel. The stainless steel tube segments will be
connected with Swagelok connectors. In addition, relatively small tube diameter will help for tighter control
of the source location, especially important in the case of the gamma sources.

The miniature sources will be attached to the stainless steel guide wire that will be pushed with a wire
driver powered by a stepper motor. A teﬂon sleeve, made out of the PTFE tubing, will envelope the guide wire
and the source to signiﬁcantly reduce friction while the source and its guide wire are being pushed around.
The wire driver will be equipped with a set of encoders and two sensor boxes for accurate positioning of the
source. A pair of ring type inductive proximity sensors placed inside the sensor box will be used to reset
the encoders when sources pass through a sensor at exactly known locations. The location will preferably be
close to the LSV, since the proximity increases the accuracy of the source positioning. Finally, both systems
will be purged with a low pressure nitrogen to eliminate any residual radioactivity that may have entered
into the tubes.

Except for the sensor box, all other parts of the LSV and TPC guide tubes that require power, control
and nitrogen ﬂow will be at the top of the water tank. The sensor box should be located as close as possible
to the calibration volume, preferable close to the top of the LSV, but inside the WCV. The sensor box will
require a power cable and a communication cable that will be routed along the guide tubes on the outside.
Since the sensor box will be integrated with the guide tube volumes inside the WCV, its interior will be
purged with nitrogen.

An elaborate testing program must be performed to ensure high quality and safety of the calibration
when using the guide tube systems. All parts will be radio-assayed and the entire system will be tested
oﬀ-site for robustness, precision and reliability. Dedicated survey is planned to record the exact guide tube
path around the cryostat.

10.5.2 Neutron Generators Deployment System

A well collimated, monoenergetic beam of neutrons is one of the most powerful tools for the calibration of
argon nuclear recoils, with respect to the mean and width of their f90 distribution in the TPC. The conceptual
design of the neutron generator deployment system is shown in Fig. 67. This system allows deployment of
the neutron generator without direct contact with the liquid scintillator, eliminating risk and safety concerns
associated with handling TMB loaded liquid scintillator.

90

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

Fig. 66. TPC and LSV guide tube systems share a common path, enclosed in the pipe passing through the WCV.
Once the tubes enter the LSV, the LSV guide tube system goes along the wall of the stainless steel sphere in a circle,
while the TPC guide tube goes along the wall and the bottom of the cryostat.

The deployment mechanism on the top lowers the neutron generator through a vertical polycarbonate
tube (15 cm in diameter and 8 m in length) to the detector equator level inside the WCV. There is a constant
ﬂow of nitrogen inside the tube, entering at the top and exiting at the bottom through a small diameter
tube. During the calibration session, dry nitrogen gas will be used to push the water out of the tube through
a small pig-tail tube at the bottom of the vertical tube. During all non-calibration times, the dry nitrogen
gas ﬂow is turned oﬀ, allowing water to ﬁll the transparent, vertical tube to preserve eﬃciency of the WCV
muon veto.

In order to deliver neutrons from the neutron generator to the TPC, a low collision path is needed
for neutrons ﬂying through the LSV. For this purpose, a nearly horizontal (slightly angles to allow release
of nitrogen gas) polycarbonate tube (5 cm in diameter and 1.7 m in length) will be installed in the LSV,
extending from the stainless steel sphere wall at the equator level (the same level as the neutron generator
when deployed in the WCV) to the wall of the cryostat. During a calibration campaign, dry nitrogen gas will
push liquid scintillator out from the tube through a small pig-tail tube at the bottom. Neutrons will easily
pass through the nitrogen ﬁlled tube and reach the cryostat and the TPC. At all other times, the nitrogen
ﬂow will be stopped, and liquid scintillator will completely ﬁll the space inside the tube. The polycarbonate
tube will be transparent and ﬁlled with liquid scintillator. In this way, the high eﬃciency of the LSV will
be preserved during normal data taking times due to the similarity of the indices of refraction between the
liquid scintillator and polycarbonate material. An essential requirement for both tubes is full displacement
of the liquids, which will be veriﬁed by a set of cameras observing bubbles coming out of the pig-tail tubes.
The horizontal polycarbonate tube will only be attached to the stainless steel sphere and not to the cryostat.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

91

Fig. 67. Neutron generator deployment system consisting of a vertical clear, polycarbonate tube in the WCV and
nearly horizontal and a narrower, clear polycarbonate pipe inside the LSV that provides a free path for the neutrons
to enter the cryostat and the TPC. The tubes have small diameter purge tubes at the bottom that allow entry and
exit of water in the WCV and liquid scintillator in the LSV.

The wall thickness will be chosen in such a way to ensure that the tube is nearly neutrally buoyant during
calibration, and negatively buoyant when ﬁlled with liquid scintillator.

Thanks to the high neutron capture cross-section of the liquid scintillator, only neutrons passing through
the tube will reach the TPC, while the rest will be stopped/captured. In this way, excellent collimation of
just 1.7◦ full opening angle is achieved. Even with this narrow opening angle, about 18 neutrons per second
from the API-120 will reach the TPC, to provide millions of monoenergetic, directional, pure neutron events
in a matter of days, in combination with the tagging information coming from the API-120’s internal 3He
detector.

10.5.3 Calibration Insertion System

CALibration Insertion System (CALIS) is a ﬂexible system that lowers diﬀerent calibration sources/devices
directly into the LSV. It has very good reach inside the LSV and can position sources/devices at various
locations, both close to the cryostat and away from it. A very similar system already exists for DarkSide-50
and has been successfully used in many of the source calibration campaigns of the DarkSide-50 experiment.
The system consists of the deployment mechanism on top of the WCV that lowers the calibration sources
and devices through an organ pipe that opens into the LSV. The assembly that holds the source and that is
lowered into the LSV can rotate and bring the source oﬀ-axis from the organ pipe, giving greater ﬂexibility
in the source positioning. The system will be completely air tight, since the organ pipe is ﬁlled with liquid

92

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

scintillator and so no exposure to air or humidity is allowed. The system will also be light tight, to avoid
risk of damaging LSV PMTs during a calibration campaign. During normal data taking, the deployment
assembly is situated inside the sealed housing on top of the WCV, while the organ pipe is sealed with a gate
valve. Two organ pipes are planned to provide good coverage of the LSV volume.

While CALIS provides ﬂexibility in the source/device positioning, its operation is more time consum-
ing and requires direct contact with the liquid scintillator. Thus, calibration with CALIS will be used for
deployment to locations the other systems cannot reach, or for sources/devices that are too large for the
guide tubes and need to be placed in locations other than the one achievable with the neutron generator
deployment tube.

10.6 The LSV and WCV Camera System

Six wide-ﬁeld-of-view cameras will be installed inside the LSV, and two additional cameras will be installed
inside the WCV. Cameras will be placed inside liquid-tight housings and will have their own sets of LED
lights for detector illumination while in use. The interior of the housings will be constantly purged with
nitrogen. Four out of six cameras in the LSV will be placed around the equator at 90◦ locations, to provide
visual coverage of the polycarbonate tube and sources deployed with CALIS. The last two cameras in the LSV
will be placed close to the top and bottom of the stainless steel sphere. DarkSide-50 has three cameras inside
its LSV that have proven to be very useful during calibration campaigns with CALIS and have operated
ﬂawlessly for several years now. While the new cameras are still to be identiﬁed (since better and cheaper
models are available on the market), the general design of the camera housings will remain the same. One
of the concerns with the cameras and housings is their contribution to the detector backgrounds, especially
potassium which is often present inside glass. However, the larger size of the LSV, combined with careful
selection of components, will mitigate any risk associated with additional backgrounds from the cameras.

The two cameras inside the WCV will be positioned close to the detector top to observe detector ﬁlling,
and at the equator level to observe displacement of water from the neutron generator deployment tube
during calibration. Cameras will be externally powered and controlled via software on a dedicated PC.
Power cables, communication (ethernet) cables and nitrogen gas tubing will be delivered to the back of each
camera, extending into the WCV.

10.7 Interfaces

The various calibration systems directly interface with the WCV, LSV and TPC.
– The vertical polycarbonate tube will be located in the WCV as a part of the neutron generator deployment
system. The tube will have a bellows on the upper end that connects it to the top ﬂange in order to
eliminate high stress on the polycarbonate tube. The tube will also be ﬁxed at the bottom to the stainless
steel sphere for stability and exact position localization, as the location at the bottom needs to be well
aligned with a horizontal tube in the LSV;

– The polycarbonate tube in the LSV will be attached to the stainless steel sphere by special ﬁxtures
that will be able to withstand buoyancy changes between the states when the tube is ﬁlled with liquid
scintillator and when the tube is purged with nitrogen. Nitrogen gas teﬂon tubing will be supplied from
the WCV top for this purpose and will use spare ports on the WCV and LSV;

– LSV and TPC guide tubes will require two ports on the top of WCV and two ports on the LSV, assuming
the ports can be shared by both systems. In addition, the LSV guide tube system will be attached to
the stainless steel sphere wall in several places. While the TPC guide tube system will not be directly
attached to the cryostat, welded brackets on the cryostat will be used to preserve its overall shape. Exact
locations of the brackets will be determined and located after the cryostat fabrication;

– CALIS will require two organ pipes that will connect the top of the WCV with the LSV top, as was
done for DarkSide-50. Organ pipes will have gate valves on the top to allow access to the LSV during
calibration;

– Cameras in the LSV and TPC will be installed in the dedicated locations on the stainless steel sphere
and WCV wall. Nitrogen lines, power and ethernet cables will be attached to the camera housings and
will be routed on the outside of the stainless steel sphere. Ports will be needed on the top of the WCV
to pass the cables and the nitrogen lines.

10.8 Performance

The expected performance of the calibration systems will be evaluated through a combination of simulations,
bench and lab tests of the built systems prior to installation and commissioning.

Experience from DarkSide-50 showed that calibration with gamma sources is more sensitive to positioning
precision than the neutron sources. Based on this experience, LSV and TPC guide tube systems should
provide source position with a couple of cm accuracy.

Activity of the gamma and neutron sources will be a compromise of the maximum triggering eﬃciency
of the DAQ and safety regulations at the LNGS, which is especially stringent in the case of neutron sources.
However, minimum activity required will be determined from the statistics needed to conduct high precision
calibrations, without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting detector livetime for WIMP search.

10.9 Additional Calibration Resources

10.9.1 Extending the LSV and WCV Energy Calibration Range with LED Light Sources

Simulation of physics interactions in the liquid scintillator and water with a controllable double LED
pulser [154] can extend the energy range for calibration far beyond ∼11 MeV (which is the maximum achiev-
able energy with more commonly used radioactive sources;). In addition, the use of radioactive sources
requires special care in order to avoid damage to the ultra-pure medium of the detector.

The concept of the calibration with LEDs implies an assumption that the total deposited energy is
directly proportional to the number of emitted photons per bunch. The LED is a preferred choice since it
is signiﬁcantly cheaper and provides a set of ﬂexible parameters like amplitude, duration, rate of pulses and
time delay between pulses, in a relatively easy manner. The calibration system design can accommodate
LEDs of diﬀerent wavelengths. There are at least two options: UV diodes for the LSV and blue ones for
the WCV. The UV LEDs are required in order to increase isotropy of the radiation in the liquid scintillator
and plausibly simulate point-like events. Anisotropy arises from the use of optical ﬁbers for light injection.
Diﬀusers provide additional tools for reduction or increase (in the case of the WCV) in anisotropy, by placing
it at the end of the optical ﬁber.

The original electrical scheme of a nanosecond LED pulser was proposed by J.S.Kapustinsky and his
colleagues in 1985 [155] and it has gained in popularity since then [156,154]. The basic simpliﬁed sketch of
the system is presented in Fig. 68. There are four main features:

1. Adjustable input of the LED pulser: The amplitude, rate and delayed time of the simulated signals
are adjustable parameters. They are set remotely by the operator using the PC software. Fig. 69 shows
a working prototype of the driver and a box with generator and control circuit.

2. Double-LEDs scheme: The LED driver has two diodes to provide two pulses very close in time. The

delay time between the two pulses can be ﬁnely controlled.

3. Controllable output of the LED pulser (line of control or power meter): Allows measurement of
the pulse energy. One uses the method of relative measurements. For calibration of the line of control a few
test sets of the pulser signals are written and compared with the other calibration data collected during
the cycle of measurements with radioactive sources. The energy scale up to 10 MeV is built and must be
linear. Then the scale is extrapolated implementing the main assumption of the proposed procedure that
the energy of the simulated signal is directly proportional to the number of emitted photons.

4. All components except the end of the ﬁber with diﬀuser can be placed outside the clean-

room.

The current design of the calibration system includes UV LEDs with wavelength (265 ± 5) nm and a
maximum pulse power of a few mW at 200 mA (pulser mode). The diodes are shown in Fig. 70. It’s worth
noting that an oﬀ-axis calibration can be performed with the proposed calibration system. It could also be
used for the development or tuning of spatial reconstruction algorithms.

10.10 Nuclear Recoil Calibration with ReD

10.10.1 Overview of ReD

Precise understanding of the scintillation and ionization signals produced by Ar nuclear recoils (NR) in LAr
will be necessary for the interpretation of data from DarkSide-20k. Members of the DarkSide collaboration

performed the SCENE experiment [87,77] in 2013, providing information on the recoil energy and electric
ﬁeld dependence of these signals which was important in the analysis of DarkSide-50 [71]. There is a plan to
perform a dedicated set of experiments to obtain additional measurements needed to extend the range and
improve the precision of the SCENE results.

The plan is to expose a small LAr TPC to variable-energy neutron beams and to study single elastic
neutron scatters from argon nuclei, as was done in SCENE. Improvements compared to SCENE will include

use of the Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode TPC (GAP-TPC), a purpose-built small LAr TPC using
DarkSide-20k photodetectors and having very high light yield for improved photoelectron statistics. Neutron-
generator and accelerator-produced beams will be used as needed to extend the recoil nucleus energy range
from the 57 keVnr maximum of SCENE up to about 200 keV. Finally, the tantalizing possibility of a variation
of the NR signals as a function of their directions relative to the applied drift (electric) ﬁeld will be studied
with a deﬁnitive high-precision and high statistics dataset.

Sensitivity to the direction of the nuclear recoils originating from WIMP scatters would be a very highly
desirable capability for a direct dark matter detection experiment. It would provide a powerful signature
(perhaps the only one) for identifying any observed signal with the galactic halo dark matter [157,158].
Detailed calculations have shown that in the standard isothermal halo model, just a few to several tens of
events are required for a statistically signiﬁcant directional signal [159], depending on the angular resolution
of the detection method. Even structures beyond the isothermal halo, like galactic tidal streams, have been
shown to give observable eﬀects in detectors with very limited directional sensitivity [160]

Initial Recoil Directionality (ReD) experiments will be carried out at Universit`a degli Studi di Napoli
“Federico II”, using a d − d neutron generator delivering monoenergetic neutrons of 2.45 MeV. Later the
experiment will move to the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) in Catania. For ReD, near-exclusive
use of beam as well as dedicated target rooms have been made available at Napoli and LNS for long-term
installation and running of the ReD detector. This mode of operation will enable lengthy runs with a stable
proton/ion beam at the desired energy, see Sec. 10.10.3. The inability to perform very long runs in a stable
setup was another limitation of the SCENE experiment, performed in user mode at the accelerator lab of
Notre Dame University.

Fig. 71 shows a schematic drawing of the experiment. LAr TPC signals from neutron elastic scattering
nuclear recoils of energy 10 keV to 200 keV in LAr will be recorded in the LAr TPC, in coincidence with
signals from the scattered neutron interacting in neutron detectors placed at various scattering angles relative
to the beam. The coincidence kinematics allow the energy and direction of the nuclear recoils occurring in
the LAr target to be precisely known event-by-event, given the beam energy and the scattered neutron angle.
As demonstrated in SCENE [87,77], the coincidence technique combined with time-of-ﬂight and the PSD
capabilities of both the LAr TPC and the neutron detectors can give a very clean selection of single-scatter
neutron elastic events.

SCENE produced a study of the response of nuclear recoils in LAr as a function of drift ﬁeld [87,77],
demonstrating that electron-ion recombination and primary scintillation yield for nuclear recoil tracks in LAr
depend strongly on the applied drift ﬁeld. SCENE also characterized the energy dependence of ionization by
nuclear recoils and γ-rays, and performed an initial search for a dependence of the nuclear recoil response

upon the direction between the drift ﬁeld and the initial momentum of the recoil. This gave tantalizing hints
of a possible directional signal above 57 keV in LAr, but no statistically signiﬁcant result. Factors limiting
the precision of SCENE included the use of cryogenic Hamamatsu R11065 PMTs, whose inherent instability
at LAr temperature was exacerbated by the high-rate environment of the accelerator target room and the
high dynamic range of the primary scintillation vs. ionization signals. This limited the beam intensity that
could be tolerated, and hence the attainable statistics, as well as introducing a number of corrections from
the several monitoring systems.

The ReD detector itself is a new type of LAr TPC, the GAP-TPC, whose innovative design takes ad-
vantage of the availability of SiPMs to increase the photoelectron yield and greatly improve the stability of
the photosensor response. The ReD GAP-TPC will be instrumented with tiles of the new-generation SiPMs
currently being developed for the DarkSide Collaboration, which are discussed in Sec. 6. The design of the
GAP-TPC maximizes the light collection eﬃciency, with SiPMs placed on the lateral surface of the detector
as well as the top and bottom, see Sec. 10.10.2.

The large-acceptance neutron spectrometer is designed to select and measure single-scatter neutron elastic
events on argon (Sec. 10.10.4). The spectrometer consists of an array of liquid scintillator neutron detectors on
precision mounts which, combined with variable-angle neutron beams, allow the neutron-TPC coincidences
to select nuclear recoils at desired angles to the (perforce vertical) GAP-TPC drift ﬁeld, including 0 and 90◦.
A directional dependence would manifest itself as a diﬀerence in the scintillation and/or ionization response
for nuclear recoils of the same energy but diﬀerent track orientations, selected from data of a single run
according to which neutron detector ﬁred.

Directional eﬀects on both scintillation light and ionization yield are expected in the recoil energy range
relevant for dark matter searches, due to the phenomenon of columnar recombination in LAr [161,162,163,
164]. Columnar recombination models suggest that the amount of ionization charge recombination (and
therefore the size of S2 relative to S1) should, under some circumstances, vary with the angle between the
ﬁeld and the track direction. When electrons are forced to drift through a column of ion-electron pairs
produced by the ionizing track, the recombination probability is enhanced. Larger eﬀects are expected for
tracks more energetic than the maximum measured with SCENE. Evidence for a subtle directional eﬀect on
α-particle scintillation ﬁeld-quenching was seen long ago [165], but an eﬀect useful for dark matter searches
has not been found.

The ReD experiment is also designed to provide a detailed characterization of the direction-averaged
nuclear recoils in LAr in the presence of drift ﬁelds. The optimized design of the GAP-TPC will minimize the
probability of contamination from multiple neutron scatters inside the active volume. The liquid scintillator
neutron spectrometer will allow a large sample of nuclear recoil events to be collected in the energy region
of interest for dark matter detection. With a slight modiﬁcation of the setup, electron recoils in LAr will
also be thoroughly studied, to help understand the response to electron recoil backgrounds. Back-to-back
511 keV coincident γ-rays from a 22Na positron source will provide a clean sample of events associated with a
single Compton interaction in the argon detector, triggered on coincidences with a liquid scintillator behind
the source. A second liquid scintillator, shielded by a collimator, will be located at a known (variable) angle
with respect to the line of travel of γ-rays, to select a precise electron recoil energy in LAr. By comparing
the electron recoil energy with the nuclear recoil energy from the neutron beam measurements, one can map
the ionization and scintillation eﬃciency as a function of the electric ﬁeld and of the energy.

The success of the ReD experiment could have a crucial impact on the broader program of the DarkSide
Collaboration. Aside from the added precision and range of detector response measurements, the discovery
of sensitivity to the direction of recoils in LAr would revolutionize the ﬁeld of dark matter direct searches
and would provide a formidable asset for DarkSide-20k, as well as future LAr detectors.

10.10.2 The ReD GAP-TPC

The ReD experimental setup is designed to minimize all neutron interactions other than single scatters in
the liquid argon. This is achieved in two ways: by reducing as much as possible the material between the
neutron beam and the LAr, and with an innovative structure for the LAr detector which minimizes the
presence of inactive volumes.

The conceptual design of the GAP-TPC detector has been described in Ref. [166]. It is conceived to
achieve a very high light of 12 PE/keVee, an exceptional single photon resolution of 5 % to 10 %, and spatial
resolution of 5 mm in each of the two directions in the x − y plane, which will considerably improve the
multi-hit events rejection.

Fig. 72. A 3D rendering of the proposed GAP-TPC detector.

A ﬁrst step towards the GAP-TPC was taken at Naples by building a prototype LAr TPC with SiPM
readout. In the present conﬁguration, the detector design closely follows that used in SCENE. The active
volume is contained within a 46 mm diameter, 112 cm tall, PTFE support structure lined with Lumirror
enhanced specular reﬂector and capped by fused silica windows. The LAr is viewed through the windows
by two SiPM 50 × 50 mm2 tiles. The windows are coated with ITO, allowing for the application of electric
ﬁeld, and copper ﬁeld rings mounted on the PTFE structure maintain ﬁeld uniformity. All internal surfaces
of the detector are evaporation-coated with TPB. A hexagonal stainless steel mesh is ﬁxed at the top of the
active LAr volume and electrically grounded to provide the drift ﬁeld (between the bottom window and the
mesh) and the extraction and ampliﬁcation ﬁelds (between the mesh and the top window).

This detector will be used for the preliminary tests of the neutron beam line. Once installed into the
experimental hall and coupled with a few neutron detectors of the neutron spectrometer, a preliminary test
of the whole experimental facility will be made, with the initial objective of reproducing the results of the
SCENE experiment.

The GAP-TPC (see Fig. 72) will have a cylindrical size of about 50 mm diameter and height. A fused silica
vessel deﬁnes the active volume, with the top and bottom windows ITO coated to allow for the application
of the electric ﬁeld. Near the top, a hexagonal mesh grid terminates the drift ﬁeld and allows the higher
extraction ﬁeld to be applied between it and the anode. The drift ﬁeld is kept uniform along the drift
coordinate by means of ﬁeld shaping rings, deposited by thin coating the walls of the fused silica vessel with
ITO. The GAP-TPC will not make use of any reﬂectors. Diﬀerent size optical readout detector modules will
be installed all around the fused silica cylinder to achieve 4π coverage.

A simple readout system based on CAEN VT1730 14-bit 500 MS/s waveform digitizers is being setup
for the GAP-TPC. For the top array it is planned to individually read out each of the SiPM dies in order to
better study the S2 signal distribution on the photosensors top plane, thereby enhancing the x−y resolution.
The bottom plane, that does not take part in the x − y reconstruction of the events, can be readout by a
single channel or more, if required by signal to noise considerations. The plan is to optimize the readout
granularity of the lateral surface by Monte Carlo simulations. The total number of signal output channels
will be in the range 35-50. Signal outputs will be fed to an external front-end ampliﬁer and then to the
waveform digitizer system. The same readout will be used for the liquid scintillator channels of the neutron
spectrometer, described below. Digitized waveforms will be recorded based on a hardware trigger generated
by a coincidence of channels above threshold. In a later stage, a more sophisticated trigger will be deployed
allowing more complex coincidence between the LAr TPC and the liquid scintillator counters.

LAr TPCs are usually housed within vacuum insulated (double walled) stainless steel cryostats, sur-
rounded by a buﬀer region of inactive argon. In this design, the main body of the TPC is a transparent fused
silica vessel deﬁning the active volume. All photosensors and the ancillary equipment are placed outside the
vessel so as to completely eliminate backgrounds due to the presence of a buﬀer of passive argon outside the

98

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

TPC. The GAP-TPC will be housed in a single-walled stainless steel cryostat. The cryostat will be equipped
with thin windows for entry and exit of the neutron beam, if the simulation studies which are underway will
suggest so. An indium-sealed top ﬂange will seal the cryostat and will mount a series of additional smaller
ﬂanges and feedthroughs needed for vacuum, LAr ﬁll, signal and HV cables, optical ﬁbers for calibration laser
signals, pressure, temperature and level monitors, safety valves, etc. A Cryomech PT90 pulse-tube provides
the cooling power through a heater block down to a condenser and cooling rods to the sensors.

Commercial argon gas will be initially passed through a commercial getter in order to remove impurities
(mainly oxygen, nitrogen and water) from both the input gas and the detector components. The system will
be equipped with a gas recirculation loop, including the possibility of injection of a gaseous 83mKr source.
An additional innovative liquid recirculation system is available in Naples. The system consists of a
mechanical bellows pump coupled with a Trigon ﬁlter placed in the vacuum jacket of the cryostat. Commercial
pumps for cryogenic liquid make use of lubricants that can spoil the LAr purity during the recirculation,
and usually run only at a ﬁxed speed. The custom-designed Naples mechanical pump uses no lubricant,
and furthermore cannot induce any electronic noise on the detector front end. It also has the ﬂexibility to
adjust the recirculation speed as needed for the experiment, and ﬁnally it is much cheaper than commercial
alternatives.

The GAP-TPC cryogenics will be equipped with an automated slow control system. The LAr ﬁlling and
emptying procedure, the LAr and the gas recirculation and the exhaust safety line will be automated by
means of pneumatic valves controlled by the slow control system. This allows parameters of the system to
be changed while the neutron beam is on, without entering in the experimental hall. It is also very beneﬁcial
in case of, e.g., a power failure of the cryocooler, since it allows an automatic quick intervention on the
cryogenic system to put the system in a safe and steady condition if needed.

The slow control system will be LabView based, allowing the necessary ﬂexibility without excessive
software eﬀort. The software architecture will be a state machine able to read, write, and display values
using a graphical user interface. The slow controls will interface with the DAQ system. In particular, before
each run there will be a complete check of the parameters and the status of the system will be logged in a
ﬁle read by the DAQ.

10.10.3 Neutron Beam at LNS

A suitable neutron beam can be produced by the accelerator facilities of the INFN LNS, using any one of a
variety of production reactions. Floor space is available to install the ReD LAr TPC at about 1 m from the
interaction point, with all ancillary services and the neutron spectrometer. The 80 deg beam line at the LNS
Tandem accelerator has been dedicated for this purpose by the LNS Scientiﬁc Committee. This will allow
stable long-term operation of the experiment and to accumulate statistics over many runs.

The LNS Tandem accelerator has a maximum terminal voltage of 15 MV and good reliability. It has been
recently upgraded, replacing the original charging belt by a pelletron system, with excellent voltage stability
veriﬁed both at low and high terminal voltages. Many isotopes can be accelerated by the Tandem, with the
exception of noble gases. The maximum current ranges from 10 nA to 200 nA typically.

As the Tandem cannot be operated in pulsed mode, the energy of the produced neutron must be re-
constructed event by event using kinematics, detecting the angle and the energy of the charged particle
produced along with the neutron in the reaction. The detection of the charged particle will provide the start
for a time-of-ﬂight measurement of the scattered neutron. The coincidence between the charged particle
detector and the LAr TPC will be recorded in the DAQ, contributing an additional method for background
reduction. Among the variety of possible reactions for neutron production, the following set is considered:
1. p(7Li,7Be)n; 2. d(d,3He)n; 3. 197Au(d,np)197Au.

Preliminary measurements will be performed using a simple neutron detector, in order to chose the
most favorable reaction for the ReD purpose and to study the room background, to minimize parasitic
interactions which would spoil the global performance. For this purpose, the 80 deg beam line must be
completely refurbished, to optimize the layout and to accommodate a new beam dump and the LAr TPC.
Moreover, a new custom-made scattering chamber is being built to host the production targets and the Si
detectors used for charged particle detection, featuring thinner walls and an exit window in the outgoing
neutron direction, to minimize the neutron interactions.

10.10.4 nToF Spectrometer

To measure the scattered neutrons, the ReD experiment will use an array of liquid scintillator neutron
detectors that can measure the neutron scattering angles and the neutron time-of-ﬂight (TOF). In this way,
for monochromatic neutrons single-scattered from LAr, the kinematics is fully determined and the 40Ar recoil
energy and direction can be reconstructed, and background from direct neutrons coming from the production
target or random coincidences of neutrons with signals in the TPC can be suppressed. The proposed neutron
spectrometer is based on 3 (cid:48)(cid:48) liquid scintillator counters from Scionix, using EJ309 liquid scintillator coupled
to ET 9821B PMTs. These tubes are fast enough to provide accurate TOF with a precision of around 1 ns.
These detectors can provide separation between neutron-induced and other signals, by using of pulse shape
discrimination, from 1.5 σ to 2.0 σ. The plan is to use 8 to 10 of such counters in the array, allowing one to
record data for diﬀerent recoil kinematics simultaneously. The geometry is still to be ﬁnalized. One scheme
foresees the construction of a lightweight mechanical structure where counters can be placed at diﬀerent
angles on support guides held at constant radius from the LAr TPC center. The support structure would
allow simultaneous detection of scattered neutrons corresponding to a given recoil energy but producing
recoil argon atoms at diﬀerent angles with respect to the electric ﬁeld direction.

11 Trigger and DAQ

11.1 Overview

The present design for the DarkSide-20k electronics and its data acquisition system (DAQ) accommodates
both the large number of sensors and the long drift-time (expected maximum electron drift time is 2.5 ms)
of the LAr TPC, and the readout of the veto detectors. The design of the DAQ has to be ﬂexible enough
to cope for the continuing progress in the SiPMs performance and for the seamless integration of the veto
detectors.

The trigger rate during dark matter search data taking has three major contributors: background events
from detector materials, background events from 39Ar, and random triggers. To estimate the ﬁrst term,

Table 12. Estimated count rates and data rates for TPC and veto readout. To estimate the typical rate from real
signals in addition to the noise rate an S1 signal of 600 PE and a true rate of 45 Hz in the LAr TPCare assumed. For
the veto detectors, data will be collected with the main LAr TPC trigger at the same 45 Hz rate. The ﬁrst line details
the data rate when each channel is digitized at the 200 MHz sampling rate for the full 50 µs window starting around
the LAr TPC trigger. The zero suppressed line takes into account the storage saving resulting from zero suppression,
which would lead to store about 20 samples (30 B) for each hit. The veto hits are dominated by the 30 kHz dark count
rate of the veto MCP-PMTs, leading to about 300 hits to be digitized in 50 µs.

the event rate measured in the UAr running of DarkSide-50 is taken, excluding the contribution from the
PMTs and from the remaining 39Ar in DarkSide-50, and scaled by the ratio of surface areas of DarkSide-20k
and DarkSide-50, a factor of 55, obtaining an expected rate of 27 Hz; it is noted that these events will be
concentrated at the surfaces of the active volume. In the assumption of a 39Ar depletion of 1400 from the
use of UAr, there will still be an additional rate of about 16 Hz from 39Ar, uniformly distributed throughout
the active volume. In summary, events with a correlated S1 and S2 signal at a rate of about 45 Hz are
expected in DarkSide-20k. The average singles rate per channel is dominated on the other hand by the DCR
of SiPMs. With the required 0.1 Hz/mm2 speciﬁcation, this will imply a single rate for detector module of
about 250 Hz. It is assumed there is only a very small possibility of occasional light leakage between PDMs
which is neglected in the following, thus, for the LAr TPC a total of 250 Hz × 5210=1.3 MHz singles rate is
expected.

Data acquisition could be initiated by a coincidence of hits in the TPC within a speciﬁed time window. A
coincidence of 7 hits in 200 ns would result in a random trigger rate well below 0.1 Hz. Nuclear recoils at the
trigger threshold, producing about 15 PE in 5 µs, would result in the collection of 6 PE to 8 PE within the
ﬁrst 200 ns. Thus, the trigger would be fully eﬃcient for WIMP-like signal of interest. S1 events for WIMP
candidates produce signals with no more than 1 PE per tile. One should expect 3.3 × 103 noise hits during
the maximum 2.5 ms drift time.

A conceptual design for the TPC DAQ is described in Sec. 11.2. A ﬂexible design could in principle lead
to a common architecture for both the TPC and vetoes, with the obvious simpliﬁcation in the operations
and commissioning of DarkSide-20k, however other options are also considered. In any case the DAQ will be
uniﬁed at the level of the central event builder.

The event building and software trigger stage is described in Sec. 11.4 and is realized with modern com-
modity CPUs and connected through fast ethernet with front-end DAQ processors. Given the low expected
rate a trigger-less option is considered viable. Digitized data would streamed to the event builder and software
trigger for a detailed analysis and trigger selection.

Synchronization between the TPC and veto DAQ and between the diﬀerent readout boards running the
TPC digitization is fundamental for the eﬀectiveness of the design, and will be provided and maintained
during data taking. The same clock source of the TPC DAQ will be used and digital signals (like GPS time
stamps or trigger IDs) will be generated to uniquely identify each event regardless of the trigger origin and
the detector. A pulsed signal to all channels will be used to check and correct the alignment of each channel
among the three detectors.

The DAQ system will be located in an electronics room that is to be placed close to the water tank, in an
environment that allows personnel access, keeping to a minimum the cable length from the LAr TPC detector
to the signal receivers. The choice of this transmission design mitigates intrinsic radioactivity inherent in
shielded coaxial cables, and has been demonstrated to keep noise at a manageable level. The alternative
optical transmission described in ?? would ease the issues related to the cable length and routing and would
imply minor revision to the electronics described in the following.

11.2 Signal Digitization

11.2.1 LAr TPC

For what concerns the LAr TPC readout, one or two analog read-out channels for each photo detector
module (PDM) are being considered, as explained in Sec. 6: the analog signal will be extracted from the

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

101

active volume of the detectors on twisted pairs or on optical ﬁbers. The baseline design of the DAQ for
the LAr TPC foresees 5210 channels, or, as backup plan, twice that number. Considering the geometry of
the detector, the properties of the light emission of S1and the propagation of ligh in the active volume, the
photons will be evenly distributed among the many PDMs. Consequently, in the region of interest for the
WIMP search, the typical occupancy of each channel will be signiﬁcanly smaller than one. In the single
photon counting hypothesis the best read-out strategy is TDC based with a time resolution of O(10 ns).
For the S2 signal, where the total number of photons in the signal depends on the details of the LAr TPC
design and may be a factor 20 higher, with approximately half the photons concentrated on a few PDMs, the
number of photoelectrons produced by one sensor may be as many as 4000 PE at a peak rate of 0.4 PE/ns.
The best strategy for the read-out of S2 is the full digitization of the waveform, which is up to 20 µs long.

The proposed design intends to eﬃciently acquire both signals with a single data stream thanks to the
use of highly optimized digital signal processing on chip (in the processors of the acquisition boards) or on
the software trigger stage of the proposed DAQ system 11.4. In the latter case the additional bandwidth
needed is signiﬁcant but would not be a bottle-neck given the present day performance of computing and
networking hardware.

The presently envisaged baseline scheme for the TPC DAQ electronics hardware foresees a signal receiver
(diﬀerential or optical), a discriminator fed with a ﬁltered signal, a high speed digitizer (12 bit at 200 MHz)
connected to a ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA) as shown in Fig 74. The number of channels that will
be served by a single FPGA, the required resources of the chip, and the number of channels per board are
still subjects of further investigations, but we assume, based on similar modern projects, that a single board
processing of the order of 30 analog channels is feasible with present-day technology.

As discussed in Sec. 6 the signal discrimination is performed after an analog ﬁlter that will minimize the
rate of fake hits: depending on the actual SNR provided by the pre-ampliﬁer a strong ﬁltering will be required
(with a formation time up to hundreds of nano seconds). The discriminator output is fed to an FPGA that
will receive as well the data of a free running digitizer. Depending on the length of the discriminated pulse,
one can select between two diﬀerent algorithms in the FPGA: for a short pulses (the case of S1) the TDC
algorithm will search in a speciﬁc gate, deﬁned by the properties of the analog ﬁlter, the time of the hit
and its amplitude. For long pulses (S2) the corresponding samples will be down-sampled with a CIC ﬁlter
to a frequency compatible with the signal of S2 (about 10 MHz). To store S1 hits 8 B are suﬃcient (2 B
for channel identiﬁcation, 4 B for timing, and 2 B for charge), while for storing the S2 waveform about 200
samples (equivalent to 300 B) is required. Various rate estimations are provided in Table 12.

The DAQ is trigger-less and is implemented by timing with respect to a 1 s clock. All module, crate, and
event builder clocks are synchronized to a master clock tied to a global GPS system. Thus each event is timed
with respect to the start of a 1 s clock signal. The DAQ records a maximum of 108 clock ticks, equivalent to
4 B of timing information. Thus, depending on when the last S2 event occurs, there is a maximum system
deadtime of 2.5 ms every 1 s, or 1/400. The system can reset in a few µs. The clock and its fan-out will be
similar to the clocking used in DarkSide-50. It is an “in-house” single width 6U VME module which accepts
TTL, LVTTL, or CMOS signals with selective 50 or 100 Ω termination. It uses a Texas Instruments CDCE906
programmable 3-PLL clock synthesizer/multiplier/divider and provides the common 50 MHz clock which is
fanned-out to all crates. It is synchronized by a GPS receiver and provides a data reset and data start every
second. The individual PLL multipliers in each FPGA in a module provide a synchronized 100 MHz clock. It
also removes any phase shifts and allows a measure event timing with respect to the data start time within
10 ns. Note that this time resolution is more than adequate, and it is very easily synchronized across the
system.

The University of Houston group is testing prototype boards based on the above design. An FPGA
board is available and is able to read 96 signals. The board is similar in architecture to Fig. 74, with the
exception that the input stage employe a simple shaper rather than an optimal ﬁlter. The state-of-the-art
FPGA implements the timing measurement of the discriminated signal and perform zero suppression and
other operation on the output of a free running digitizer at 50 MB/s. The board had been originally designed
for the readout of the time and charge of hits in the Mu2e experiment tracker.

11.2.2 Veto

Several options are considered for the readout of the about 230 PMTs of the veto detectors, as discussed
also in Sec. 9. In short, in order to work the prompt and delayed veto analysis, and to calibrate the energy
response of the LSV detector from few tens of keV to a few MeV, both charge and timing information of PMT
pulses are needed. Preliminary simulations showed that PMTs are no more in SPE regime for signals in the

detector, electronics, and DAQ.

LSV above a few hundred MeV, therefore a charge readout is necessary. A timing-only readout is adequate
for the WCV readout, where precise energy calibration is not fundamental. With the aim of maximizing
the electronics uniformity for the DAQ system the time information can be easily extracted using the same
hardware architecture used for the LAr TPC readout (Sec. 11.2). The front-end board developed for the
Veto system described in Sec. 9.4 can also perform the time measurement within the FPGA included in the
design. For what concern the energy measurement, due to the diﬀerent signal time structure, between the
LAr TPC and LSV, it might be necessary to have dedicated systems for the LSV. This option is still being
explored.

11.3 Expected Performances from Simulation of the LAr TPC DAQ

Simulation studies have been performed to understand the expected performance of the readout scheme
discussed above. Simulated samples of both electron recoils from 39Ar decay and 40Ar nuclear recoils have
been produced using the DarkSide-20k geometry, including the detailed PDM layout on the top and bottom
photosensor plane, including the 2 mm wide gaps between PDMs, resulting in a geometric eﬃciency of about
92.5 %. The photon detection eﬃciency for the PDM is set to 40 % requirement, see Sec. 6.1. In order to
obtain a more accurate simulation of the system response SiPMs noise is taken into account and injected in
the data-ﬂow: the dark count rate is set to 250 Hz per readout channel uniformly distributed in time, while
the correlated noises amount to 10 % for AP (after-pulse probability) and 15 % for DiCT (direct cross talk);
DeCT (delayed cross talk) has been neglected since it is negligible, see Sec. 6.4. The readout simulation is
performed on two parallel tracks: the ﬁrst employs TDCs to produce “hits”, the second one uses ADCs to
sample the analogical waveforms in a temporal window, thus giving the charge. The ADC simulation uses
12 bits digitization; the SPE (single photo-electron) response is set to have on average an amplitude of 6
bits, leaving the other 6 free to have a dynamic range of 64 PE. Hits carry the arrival time information,
performing well in the estimation of the S1 prompt fraction of light, while ADC sampled signals are needed
to measure the number of photons for S2 signals due to the high occupancy of the readout channels in this
case. Events in the simulation are uniformly distributed in the LAr volume, with the 39Ar energy spectrum
for electron recoils and a power law spectrum for 40Ar nuclear recoils. The time structure of S1 and S2 signals
can be seen in Fig. 75. Typical hit maps are shown in Fig. 76 for both S1 and S2 signals. After a ﬁducial
cut of 5 cm from the top and bottom planes of the SiPMs in the TPC volume no saturation is observed for
either S1 or S2 signals.

In the energy region relevant for dark matter searches, the great majority of detector modules report
at most 1 PE, hence energy can be reconstructed by just counting the number of detector modules above
threshold in an appropriate time window, here set to 6 µs after a trigger given by a coincidence of at least
7 hits in 200 ns. As shown in Fig 77 the resulting distribution is quite narrow, thus resulting in a good
resolution up to energies of few hundred of keV. Taking into account also the hit multiplicity per PDM
results in a good linearity for S1 signal but in a slightly worse resolution. This eﬀect is due to the SiPMs
noise injected in the simulation, whose intrinsic nature spoils the hits counting keeping relatively unaﬀected
the number of tiles above threshold. The resolution of the S1 estimators is between 5% and 10%, with higher
values in the very low energy region as shown in Fig. 77.

For what concerns S2 the signal sampling in a ﬁxed time window may not integrate the whole charge of
the pulses, whose duration can well exceed the microsecond. Moreover the baseline noise further degrades
the resolution of the estimation. The measured S2 pulse integral vs true event energy is shown in Fig. 78,
left panel. The simulation of the DAQ described above result in the resolution in S2 of order 10% in the
relevant energy range as shown in the right panel of Fig. 78.

In conclusion, this preliminary study demonstrates that the readout and DAQ envisaged allows the
reconstruction of energy for both S1 and S2 signals, while the foreseen timing resolution on photon detection
of O(10 ns) would preserve the information needed for PSD. A very preliminary algorithm for reconstruction
of the XY position of hits using the digitized information has also shown to provide the required sub-
centimeter resolution needed for eﬃcient ﬁducialization in DarkSide-20k.

11.4 Event Builder and Software Trigger

Online event selection and event building in the trigger is planned to be performed in two steps, both of
them implemented with two software-based triggers, Level-0 (L0T) and Full-Event (FET) triggers. L0T
and FET together form the High Level Software Trigger (HLST) of the experiment. The event selection
in the HLST triggers proceeds in steps for feature extraction (e.g., ﬁducialization, energy reconstruction,
LAr TPC and veto coincidence etc.) and trigger decisions. At the end of each step the results are checked
against the requirements deﬁned in trigger tables. While the L0T trigger algorithm is designed to implement
very simple hit counting criteria within predeﬁned time-windows, similar to the ones used in the hardware
trigger of the DarkSide-50 experiment but exploiting the advantage of the higher ﬂexibility allowed by a
software based trigger, the FET trigger attempts a full oﬄine-like event reconstruction, using a version of
the oﬄine reconstruction software customized for the online environment and reﬁned calibrations. The HLST
is designed to provide:
– Full event-building and global event selection: TPC+veto;
– Online full event reconstruction with oﬄine-quality;
– Prompt pre-processing of raw data before transfer to main oﬄine data centers;
– Tools and computing power for high level monitoring of detector reconstruction performances in real

time.

Fig. 79. Schematic view of the DarkSide-20k HLST trigger system. Only the O10 crates for LAr TPC are considered
in this graph.

Being fully based on software, the system will guarantee high level of ﬂexibility, allowing to expand
processing capabilities by just adding cpus/storage/network links blocks in order to scale up the system as
needed, and to implement diﬀerent data-reduction and selection strategies and to modify them when needed.
A schematic view of the HLST trigger system is shown in Fig. 79. The L0T trigger includes a time
ordering step, in which time-ordered parallel to serial conversion of data from the front-end readout system
is performed. In addition the S2/S1 coincidence signal identiﬁcation would be possible as well as the full event
building step of all the veto detectors. The FET trigger includes all the remaining logical steps (reconstruction
of the events and production of the event record in analysis/oﬄine EDM format, feature extraction and high
level selection according to the trigger tables, algorithms and logging for online data quality monitoring
(DQM), and ﬁnally persistiﬁcation and data logging/streaming to online storage. Raw data from the front-
end readout systems, are stored in O(10) memory buﬀers, to match the number of LAr TPC and veto
front-end crates, deep enough to store hours of data taking. With the rate expected from the front-end
readout design for 512 GB of memory for all buﬀers is enough to keep up to 4h of data at sustained rate.
L0T step is expected to reduce the trigger rate from the 1.3 MHz input from the front-end readout below
100 Hz, while the FET step will reduce the L0T rate further and will produce several parallel output data
streams (physics, monitoring, calibration, etc...)

11.4.1 HLST Hardware and Software Options

For the hardware architecture two equivalent options are envisioned and under study: a system based on
conventional commodity CPUs computing farm, or a mixed system exploit parallel processing power of
modern high-end multicore GPU based systems. In case the CPU farm solution is chosen it is foreseen to
install the HLST event selection farm in one of two racks hosting the L0T and FET processors, the local
storage and the network switch apparatus. A dedicated machine with 4 Xeon-E5-2650V3 class processors
with 10 physical cores each, 512 GB RAM used as I/O buﬀer and 2 10 Gbit/s ETH ﬁber interfaces is dedicated
to run the L0T and Event building, while 10 1U rack mountable machines with 2 Xeon-E5-2650V3 class
processors, 128 GB RAM and 2 10 Gbit/s ETH ﬁber interface and 2 × 1 TB2 NLSAS HD storage system will
be able to sustain the reconstruction of events at oﬄine level at rates up to 400 Hz. In case the GPU solution
is chosen, the entire CPU part of the system can be replaced by a NVIDIA high-end GPU rack-mountable
system, like for example the NVIDIA DGX-1 system, with 2 Intel Xeon CPUs with 512 GB RAM and 8
Tesla P100 class boards (30720 physical cores) with 16 GB HBM2 memory each, connected with NVLink
GPU to GPU bidirectional link at 10 GB/s, 7 TB SSD storage ad dual 10 Gbit/s Ethernet interface. Both
systems will be able to fulﬁll the requirements needed for the HLST trigger system. The GPU solution allows
in addition to implement highly parallel techniques for S2 signal reconstruction from the stored waveforms,
for 3D reconstruction of the position of the interaction via multivariate pattern-recognition techniques, and,
if needed, for oﬄine optimal ﬁltering of the SPE waveform to extract a precise timing information for S1
and PSD.

106

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

L0T and FET reconstruction and event selection algorithms run inside the processing units (CPU or
GPU physical cores). Each processing unit can process events in parallel in concurrent worker-threads.
Multi-threading minimizes overheads from context-switching and avoids stalling the CPU when waiting for
requested data from the L0T/Event Builder system, or when publishing monitoring information. While this
ansatz allows for an eﬃcient use of multi-CPU and multi-core processor resources, it requires that all software
running in the HLST is thread-safe. This is handled by the data ﬂow software itself, including creation and
deletion of threads and synchronization of resources. As software framework for the data ﬂow software two
possible solution are envisaged: one based on the artdaq online software framework form Fermilab, already
used in the DarkSide-50 experiment, or, a system based on the FELIX [167] framework and the ATLAS
experiment software trigger steering software, exploiting the developments for the integration of GPU and
parallel computing systems in software trigger systems ongoing for the next phase of operations of the LHC
experiments.

11.5 Trigger schemes for global and local running

In normal running condition a trigger would be issued by a signal above threshold in the TPC. The DAQ
would then record data corresponding to the reconstructed event in the TPC along with PMTs signal
following (and proceeding) the TPC trigger, in order to be able to perform the prompt and delayed neutron
tagging oﬄine. The veto should also be able to trigger on its own activity for calibration and monitor
purposes. Muons crossing the WCV should also be used as trigger input for the TPC and LSV during
regular data taking, to check the cosmogenic backgrounds.

A data acquisition window which at least includes the veto delayed window must be opened in the veto at
each TPC trigger. The data acquisition window should also record data for few tens of microseconds before
the prompt window, and for ﬁfty microsecond after the delayed window, in order to record and monitor the
accidental backgrounds. Random triggers could also be generated with the same goal. The ﬂexibility of the
HLST and the common DAQ design for all the subdetectors, should also allow easily to generate triggers
from signal in the veto without asking explicitly for a signal in the TPC in order to understand ineﬃciencies
in an unbiased sample.

Stand-alone runs for the various sub-detectors would be possible by partitioning the HLST and conﬁguring

its processes appropriately for test or calibration purposes.

11.6 Auxiliary Systems and Infrastructure

An electronics room located in the vicinity of the water tank will host most of the DAQ electronics for all
the DarkSide-20k subsytems, with a possible exception for LAr TPC signal receivers and digitizer for which
it is crucial to stay as close as possible to the TPC external ﬂanges in order to minimize cable length and
hence noise pickup.

While the exact number of crates and racks will be ﬁxed at a later stage depending on exact technological
choice, it is anticipated that the room will need O10 racks to host LAr TPC veto electronics, a clock
distribution system and the HLST. Power supply and HV system for the LAr TPC Detector Modules and
SiPMs will be also located in the same infrastructure. Given the power distribution system scheme described
in 6.13 it is envisaged that around 220 low and high voltage power supply modules would be hosted in
addition in the electronics room. Commercial, oﬀ the shelf, solutions will be adequate for such systems and
possible candidates are the CAEN A1542(H) and CAEN A1518B models, respectively.

An eﬃcient cooling system, analogous in size to the current Borexino one, will be installed in order to
control the temperature inside the electronics room given the amount of power dissipation expected from
the DAQ and power supply modules.

11.7 Slow-Control System

The slow control system (SCS) is a DAQ-independent system that will provide control and a real time mon-
itoring of diﬀerent hardware systems including: SiPM, TPC electric ﬁeld HHV, scalers, LAr TPC cryogenic
system and auxiliary facilities. The SCS is being designed in order to make all the subsystems and services
interoperable to achieve a reliable and robust system. The concepts of scalability and usability through a
multilayered architecture and abstraction concepts are taken into account throughout the development of the

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

107

Fig. 80. DarkSide-20k software multilayered architecture.

slow control to allow for easy further customization, conﬁguration and reuse. The whole software will be de-
veloped using LabView (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench), a system-design platform
and development environment for a visual programming from National Instruments. The SCS architecture
as illustrated in Fig. 80 is based on a distributed layered architecture that allows integrating many services
that communicate with diﬀerent devices and diﬀerent hardware through various protocols.

The architecture consists of four separate layers:

1. Presentation layer;
2. Logic layer (services and CompactRIO);
3. Data layer;
4. Hardware and devices layer.

The presentation layer is a set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which allow controlling and monitoring
all the subsystems, it is the layer which users can access directly. The logic layer is a set of components, the
majority of them are deployed as services and they communicate either to servers application or directly to
devices. Any service may run on any node of the DarkSide-20k network, a reliable private network where all
the SCS services will be deployed. The SCS monitors all the critical parameters and sends alarm messages
to shifters and experts according to a set of thresholds. Notiﬁcations are sent via short message service
(SMS) and via e-mail. In this layer there is also a dedicated service to control the cryogenic system and it is
deployed inside the CompactRIO. The CompactRIO is a combination of a real-time controller, reconﬁgurable
IO Modules (RIO), FPGA module and an Ethernet expansion chassis. The real-time controller is a powerful
processor with a wide range of clock frequencies for implementing the control algorithm. The Data Layer
implements the SCS data persistency. The DataBase used for storage and persistence is PostgreSQL, an
open-source object-relational database management system with an emphasis on extensibility and standards
compliance.

The Veto system in DarkSide-50 was equipped with a slow control implemented in NI LabVIEW, the
same system could be deployed for DarkSide-20k. The Veto slow control will set parameters like the high
voltage of the PMTs and the thresholds of the discriminators of the front end electronics, and it will read the
PMT currents and dark noise rates, among other parameters. The set and read parameters will be stored into
a database and alarm conditions will be set in case of failure or values outside speciﬁed ranges. A remotely
accessible display of the relevant parameters will be created. The gains of the PMTs will be monitored by
building the charge spectra of single photoelectrons using a pulsed laser and optical ﬁbers. A software code
will adjust the high voltage of each PMT in order to equalize their gain.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

12 Computing

12.1 Introduction

The data storage and oﬄine processing system must support transfer, storage, and analysis of the data
recorded by the DAQ system, for the entire lifespan of the experiment. It must also provide for production
and distribution of simulated data, and access to conditions and calibration information and other non-event
data and the physics analysis activities of the collaboration. Additional, necessary components of the data
storage and oﬄine system are provision of the software framework and services, the data management system,
user-support services, and the world-wide data access and analysis job-submission system. The design of the
system is built upon the knowledge acquired in the construction and operations of the DarkSide-50 detector.

12.1.1 Requirements

The large number of channels in the LAr TPC makes it impractical to digitize and save the full waveform of
each channel, as done in DarkSide-50. Nevertheless, the charge and hit time information that will be saved will
preserve all the necessary details about the amplitude and time evolution of the signals generated in the tar-
get. With appropriate ﬁltering and compression, in addition to the expected background reduction described
elsewhere in this document, the amount of data selected for recording in DarkSide-20k is expected to be only
a few times that of DarkSide-50. The DarkSide-50 experiment typically collects about 9 × 105 events/day, of
which 8 × 105 events/day come from laser calibrations, with the remaining 1 × 105 events/day from the dark
matter search. The size of a DarkSide-50 laser calibration event is about 0.1 MB, while the size of a dark
matter search data event is about 2.6 MB. This is expected to decrease by a factor of ∼10 in DarkSide-20k,
despite the much larger number of channels. Taking into account the event size and data rate, the improved
background rejection and data ﬁltering, and using the experience from DarkSide-50 the short-term storage
required at the experimental site is expected to be less than 20 TB. Long-term data storage will be at the
INFN Tier2 computing center in Rome and at Fermilab for oﬄine processing and analysis. The total storage
inventory required for the experiment at both locations is expected to be on the order of 2 PB. This includes
the storage needed for simulated and reconstructed events, which take much less space than raw data.

12.2 Computing Model

12.2.1 Computing systems and data workﬂow

The primary event processing occurs at the experimental site in the software trigger farm described elsewhere
in this document. Pre-processed data is archived on the temporary storage at the experimental site and copied
to central computing centers (Tier-1/Tier-2) developed and used for LHC computing activities located in
Italy and USA. These facilities archive the pre-processed data, provide the reprocessing capacity, provide
access to the various processed versions, and allow analysis of the processed data. Derived datasets produced
in the physics analyses are also copied to the Tier-1/Tier-2 facilities for further analysis and long-term
storage. The Tier-1/Tier-2 facilities also provide the simulation capacity for the DarkSide-20k experiment.
Bulk data processing is expected to be performed using low cost commodity cluster computing based on
commercial CPUs available both at the Italian Tier2 facility and at Fermilab. Final data analysis will be
performed either directly at the Italian Tier-1/Tier-2 centers and Fermilab or on commercial CPUs hosted at
institutes participating in the collaboration. PNNL also has resources available and is already established as
a Tier-1 data handling site for the Belle II experiment. Contributions from PNNL could include distributed
data management, data workﬂow and data processing and storage, and expertise of PNNL collaborators
with substantial experience in grid (distributed) computing and advanced architectures. There is also the
option of using the considerable free resources available on the Open Source Grid. Many experiments are
currently using the Open Source Grid to run their reconstruction and analysis jobs, and have access to more
than one million CPU hours per week.

The amount of short term storage currently available at LNGS for DarkSide-50 consist of 7 TB of front-
end storage used as temporary buﬀer and located in the underground laboratory, plus 710 TB of disk space
in the above ground computing center for short- and long-term storage of DarkSide-50 data. From there,
raw data are copied to CNAF and Fermilab for reprocessing and analysis. CNAF is making available 670 TB
of disk storage and 300 TB of tape storage. At Fermilab, there is 50 TB of fault-tolerant disk storage and

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

109

about 620 TB on the dCache-based tape system for long-term storage. It is expected that much of this
inventory will be recycled for the DarkSide-20k experiment, aside from what is necessary for ongoing storage
of DarkSide-50 raw data. Any necessary additional tape storage will be purchased and installed. The total
amount of storage for the ﬁve years of data-taking, including calibration and simulated data, is 2 PB of
disk storage and 1 PB of tape storage. The processing power currently used for reprocessing and analysis of
DarkSide-50 data includes a farm of 400 cores at LNGS for production and validation, plus 300 job queues
at CNAF and 25 guaranteed batch slots (soon to increase to 60 guaranteed batch slots) on the Fermilab grid
system. The latter is extensible up to several thousand slots when the Fermigrid cluster load is light. As for
the mass storage, a large fraction of this is expected to continue to be available for DarkSide-20k. Finally,
the previously-mentioned option of using the Open Source Grid would dramatically increase the amount of
available processing power.

Currently, a single DarkSide-50 event takes about a half of a second to reconstruct on a typical 2.8 GHz
processor, meaning that 100 dedicated cores can maintain reconstruction in realtime for an event rate up
to 200 Hz. Assuming a factor two increase in the cpu time needed to reconstruct an event, a factor ten to
simulate a full event, a real data plus calibration event rate of 100 Hz, and a sample of simulated events of
the same dimension of the real-data one, DarkSide-20k needs 100 dedicated cores to maintain reconstruction
in realtime of the collected real data + calibration events, and 1000 dedicated cores to produce the simulated
samples. Moreover 2000 physical cores are suﬃcient to reprocess in three months all physics events collected
in one year. This amount of processing power can be achieved using either the Italian Tier-1/Tier-2 centers,
or the Fermilab resources alone and exploiting the Open Source Grid/Cloud available resources.

12.3 Software Environment

DarkSide-20k will adopt an object-oriented approach to software, based primarily on the C++ programming
language, with some components implemented using other high level languages (Python etc.). A software
framework has been built up during the DarkSide-50 experiment which provides ﬂexibility in meeting the
basic processing needs of the experiment, as well as in responding to changing requirements. In order to
support code reuse, common user access to low-level algorithms used for I/O, and data persistency, and to
build a system optimized for both the oﬄine and software trigger environments, the C++ code will make
heavy use of object oriented abstract interfaces techniques.

12.3.1 Simulation

G4DS is a Geant4-based simulation toolkit speciﬁcally developed for DarkSide. The modular architecture
of the code was developed in order to describe the energy and time responses of all the detectors belonging
to the DarkSide program, namely DarkSide-10 DarkSide-50 and DarkSide-20k. For each of them, G4DS
provides a rich set of particle generators, detailed geometries, opportunely tuned physical processes, and the
full optical propagation of the photons produced by scintillation in liquid argon and by electroluminescence
in gaseous argon.

The main goals of G4DS are: the accurate description of the light response, to calibrate the energy
responses in S1 and S2 and the time response expressed by the f90 variable; the tuning of the analysis
cuts and their eﬃciency estimation; the prediction of the electron and nuclear recoil backgrounds; and the
deﬁnition of the signal acceptance band.

G4DS tracks photons up to their conversion in photoelectrons, which occurs when a photon reaches the
active region of a photosensor and survive to the quantum eﬃciency. The conversion of the photoelectron
into a charge signal is handled by the electronic simulation, an independent, custom-made C++ code. The
electronic simulation embeds all the eﬀects induced by the photosensors (e.g. after-pulse and cross talk) and
by the electronics itself (e.g. saturation). The electronic simulation also has the option to overlap simulated
events and real baselines in order to provide more realistic simulations. As output, it produces waveforms
for each channel with the same data format of the real data in order to be processed by the reconstruction
code, the same used by the real data.

G4DS can also track events generated by FLUKA and TALYS simulation codes, opportunely developed
for the DarkSide program. The FLUKA simulation is mostly used to study cosmogenic isotope productions,
while TALYS for the (alpha,n) reactions, and hence the prediction of the nuclear recoil background.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

12.3.2 Reconstruction

The role of reconstruction is to derive from the stored raw data a reduced set of physics parameters and
auxiliary information necessary for physics analysis. The reconstruction combines information from the TPC
and the veto detectors. A typical reconstruction algorithm takes one or more collections of information from
the event data model (EDM) raw data stream as input, calls a set of modular tools, and outputs one or more
collections of reconstructed objects. Common tools are shared between reconstruction algorithms, exploiting
abstract interfaces to reduce dependencies.

12.3.3 Calibration

Analysis of calibration data will be performed within the reconstruction and simulation software environment.
Details on requirements and expected performances are described in Sec. 10.

12.3.4 Databases

DarkSide-20k will produce roughly 500 TB of data annually, combining the data processing, simulation, cal-
ibration and distributed analysis activities. A data storage and management infrastructure is necessary to
allow eﬃcient storage and access to all this data. Two types of data storage are foreseen: ﬁle-based data
and relational-database-resident data. File storage is used for bulky items such as event data (physics data,
calibration data and simulation data). Database storage is used for other types of information, including:
technical data like detector production, installation, survey and geometry data; online/TDAQ databases;
conditions databases (online and oﬄine); oﬄine processing conﬁguration and bookkeeping information; and
to support distributed data and database management services. File-based storage of C++ objects will be
implemented through the use of ROOT I/O, which provides high performance and highly scalable object se-
rialization to random-access ﬁles. Database storage will be based on SQL-based relational databases (MySQL
and SQLite). All these technologies are widely used and well tested in HEP experiments.

12.3.5 GRID tools and services

Computing resources will be accessed by through Grid middleware components and services. These provide
services for software installation and publication, production operations and data access for analysis through
a uniform security and authorization infrastructure, as well as interfaces for remote job submission and
data retrieval, and job scheduling tools designed to optimize utilization of computing resources. The Grid
infrastructure will be based on the infrastructure and the software tools and services developed for the LHC
Computing Grid (LCG) project.

12.3.6 Use of the oﬄine software for online HLST and monitoring

The High-Level Software Trigger (HLST) provides the online event selection. The trigger is based on an
online version of the DarkSide-50 reconstruction software, which has been optimized and tailored for the
DarkSide-20k online environment running on farms of Linux PCs and/or GPUs farms. Overall, the HLST
has to provide the required rate reduction and pre-processing of raw data, including the production of global
event records in analysis EDM format. The HLST will use the oﬄine computing environment, allowing
DarkSide-20k considerable commonality in the design and management of the selection software itself. This
also allows the HLST to use various oﬄine software components, like detector description, calibrations, EDM,
and reconstruction algorithms. The same infrastructure can be used for data monitoring by simply replacing
or augmenting the selection algorithms with those for monitoring.

12.3.7 Code management and distributions, quality assurance and documentation

The computing group will provide and maintain the software development environment, including: code man-
agement tools (Git, Github, etc.); managing the use of external software (for example CERN Root, Geant4,

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

111

theory interpretation codes, etc.); providing scripting for building software releases; producing code distri-
bution kits; and providing documentation such as web, wiki pages, bug reporting etc. The computing group
plans to make use of the typical quality assurance and quality control tools used in HEP large experiments
(i.e. LHC experiments). Code documentation will be provided, using standard web pages as central starting
points for ﬁnding documentation. Doxygen and Twiki web pages will be used to for code documentation and
to document speciﬁc sub-projects and provide instructions and tutorials.

12.4 Computing Operations

DarkSide-20k software builds will be organized into several categories: nightly builds, developer releases, pro-
duction releases, and bug-ﬁxes to releases. The production releases hold the stable code, used for production
and end-user analysis. Production release builds will be managed and supervised by a Release Coordinator
and a team of librarians. The responsibility of the Release Coordinator will be to ensure that all software
components work together in a coherent way, and to patch the releases and the software distribution with
bug-ﬁxes when needed. Production releases will be installed on the Grid using the methods developed for
the LCG.

12.4.1 Commissioning of the system

Data processing in the initial phase of data taking is likely diﬀer from the steady state case. Initial devel-
opment of primary calibrations and reconstruction algorithms will lead to an intensive need for raw data
access. While the distribution and access to the data should be well prepared and debugged by various data
challenge tests based on DarkSide-50 data and on the DarkSide-Proto data, it is envisaged that in the early
stages much of the data will be taken in raw-data format (i.e. without HLST pre-processing). The storage
and processing power has also been dimensioned and staged to accommodate this phase with, for example,
repeated re-processing of the initial data.

12.5 Development Testing

Risks associated with the deployment of the computing system are related to possible delays in the various
computing sub-projects which might prevent DarkSide-20k from preparing a complete and coherent software
suite and computing environment in time for the beginning of data taking. To mitigate these risks, the
plan is to organize a series of “data challenges” to test the development of the software framework and the
computing infrastructure at progressively larger and larger scales. These data challenges will start very early
in the development of the computing system, testing the following, in order of increasing complexity: the
ability to simulate a sizable number of events with the detector geometry; the ability to reconstruct and to
produce physics-analysis level objects; the ability to perform simulation and reconstruction using the Grid
infrastructure; and ﬁnally a general test of all the components of the computing model including all the
software components (simulation, reconstruction, databases, distributed computing etc..).

13 Materials and Assay

Trace radioactivity in detector materials is a major (and often the dominant) source of background in direct
dark matter searches. Betas and alphas from decays of these contaminants can be backgrounds from materials
in contact with the active LAr, while gammas and neutrons (from spontaneous ﬁssion and (α, n) interactions)
can produce background from more distant sources.

A strategy for selecting and employing materials that maximizes the physics reach of the detector by
controlling backgrounds from such radioactivity has been developed. This will be accomplished by developing
a “background budget” to identify materials purity and assay requirements, developing cleaning and handling
processes to meet radiopurity requirements, and performing assays to identify clean materials and to validate
processes and sources during construction and commissioning of detector components.

13.1 Background Budget & Assay Priorities

The Materials and Assay working group (M&A WG) will maintain the background budget of DarkSide-20k,
giving the radiopurity requirements on each material or component of critical systems, chieﬂy the TPC, cryo-
stat, photodetectors, and neutron veto. A crucial input to the background budget comes from Monte Carlo
simulations that, when normalized by measured or assumed activities, give estimates of expected background
from particular sources. Another input is the expected background rejection. Rejection of electron-recoil
backgrounds relies primarily on Pulse Shape Discrimination (see Sec. 14), while neutrons are rejected using
the LSV (see Sec. 9). Additional rejection is provided by the ﬁducial-volume and single-scatter cuts. The
background budget will clearly evolve as assays are performed and more components’ activities are deter-
mined, the detector design is updated, the Monte Carlo detector geometry and physics models improve, and
background rejection estimates improve. Also, the background budget is iterative; lower achieved activity in
one component aﬀects the targets for other components.

Initially, the background budget is made with activities known to be achievable based on the experience
in DarkSide-50 and published measurements from other experiments. An example is given in Table 16, which
serves as an indication of the feasibility of the experiment with existing materials, as well as providing initial
targets for both radiopurity and background rejection. Moving forward, focus will be put on the major
sources of potential background: typically those that are present in large masses (e.g., cryostat titanium or
steel, PTFE reﬂectors in the TPC, copper ﬁeld cage rings, the LAr itself), those that are in contact with or
very close to the active LAr (e.g., PTFE, fused silica windows, SiPM arrays, wavelength-shifter), and those
that have high (α, n) neutron yields (such as PTFE). For the LSV, the steel of the tank, the PMTs, and the
components of the scintillator itself must be assayed, primarily to ensure that the rate in the LSV will be
low enough to allow the low energy thresholds needed for eﬃcient neutron vetoing (see Sec. 9.2).

The background studies leading to Table 16 used the activities in Table 13, measured by DarkSide and
other experiments, for normalization. They indicate that the biggest sources of neutrons are the cryostat
(titanium or steel) and the PTFE reﬂector panels. The resulting neutron background rates from these
components are comparable, but with caveats like the fact that the PTFE U/Th activities in Table 13
are upper limits. This gives a high priority to searches for suppliers of lower-activity stocks of these three
materials. Early indications are that such searches may be successful – for example, ICP-MS results from the
Skobeltsyn Institute for Nuclear Physics at Moscow State University (MSU) demonstrate the potential for
having Ti with an order of magnitude lower 238U and a factor of a few lower 232Th than those assumed in the
preparation of Table 13 and achieved by other groups (e.g., Ref. [110]). The ability to source such material
in quantity will obviously inform the titanium versus stainless-steel decision to be made for the cryostat.
In some cases, such as PTFE, assays with higher sensitivity than those used up to now (in particular, for
210Pb) may be needed to allow characterization of especially clean samples. Other particularly high-priority
materials are the sapphire substrates for the SiPMs and the PMTs for the outer detector systems. All of
these high-priority assay campaigns have begun; a few speciﬁc cases are discussed below.

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

The plan is to assay all materials or items selected to reside within the TPC cryostat. This becomes
more straightforward as the major materials discussed above are ﬁnalized; the criterion for other materials
becomes “negligible impact on the overall background.” As samples are acquired, they will be queued for
assay as described below. It is also part of the M&A WG’s responsibility to prioritize assays before the other
working groups acquire samples; potentially problematic materials, say with high (α, n) yields, must have
samples acquired early for screening.

13.2 Managing Assay Capabilities

The DarkSide-20k collaboration possesses diverse assay capabilities with signiﬁcant throughput capacity.
Critical to taking advantage of this large capacity is a thorough organization of the assay eﬀort. Often in
low-background experiments the responsibility for obtaining radiopurity assay of a candidate material has
fallen on the material user, which is a model fraught with ineﬃciencies. In DarkSide-20k the responsibility
is delegated to the M&A WG, a single working group within the collaboration, comprised of experts for each
of the assay methods and representatives from each institution that hosts assay capability. This has given
the collaboration a single point of contact with the capability and capacity for DarkSide-20k’s entire assay
needs.

The assay of materials is a well-deﬁned process that begins with a formal request and ends with an oﬃcial
assay report and recording of results in the materials database. The process is sketched in Fig. 81. The initial
request is initiated with an online request form that asks for:

1. requester information;
2. sample details (supplier, lot number, etc.);
3. assay requests (i.e., analytes, activity levels, number of samples, etc.).

Submission of this form also initiates an entry in a database of materials, which is updated as the assay
process progresses. It is also possible to include other pertinent information about the material (e.g., material
properties, etc.), as well as relevant documentation (e.g., datasheets).

The request is reviewed within the M&A WG to determine both the limit of activity that the material
must meet and the best method for assay based on such things as material properties, type of analyte, and
whether destructive assay is permitted. The institution within the M&A WG that has the necessary assay
capability, the requisite sensitivity, and the availability to perform the assay is then assigned the assay task.
The material “owner” is instructed where to send the material and the assay is performed. The M&A WG
then reviews the results and an oﬃcial report is sent to the material owner.

Throughout the process, the database entry for the material is updated with assay information as it
becomes available, including such things as assay method and institution. When the ﬁnal results are available
and have been reviewed by the M&A WG, they are input into the database and the entry for that material
is ﬁnalized.

An example of the success of this organizational model comes from the assay of a 10 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMT that is a
candidate for use in the water tank. This was an unusual assay because of the PMT’s large size and the need
to assay it nondestructively. The owner of the PMT contacted the M&A WG about assaying the PMT and
submitted the online request form. After some discussions with the owner and review of the assay request,
it was determined that both PNNL and Temple could reconﬁgure existing counting chambers to assay the
device via γ-ray spectroscopy. Within six business days of receiving the online assay request, an institution
was chosen to perform the assay and the PMT owner was instructed to ship the PMT to Temple. In less
than six weeks after submitting the request, the PMT was shipped to the United States from Italy, assayed
with a HPGe counter in two diﬀerent conﬁgurations, and the results were reported and recorded.

The streamlined organization of the materials and assay eﬀort ensures that materials for DarkSide-20k
will be screened in the most eﬃcient way possible. Additionally, when there are materials or parts of the
experiment that require unique assays, the group surveys its institutional points of contact to identify
solutions quickly. The organizational structure described here removes the burden of assaying materials
from individual collaborators and other working groups and eﬀectively places it on the M&A WG, the most
capable group of collaborators for evaluating and performing radiopurity assay.

13.3 DarkSide-20k Assay Resources

To ensure the radiopurity of all detector materials to the levels deﬁned by the background model, the
M&A WG has developed a radiopurity assay program that takes advantage of facilities throughout the
collaboration. Overall, it is anticipated that this program will span approximately three years and will
involve a few thousand assays, including searches for radiopure materials, development and validation of
cleaning and handling procedures, and screening of all detector components. The collaboration has extensive
and diverse assay capabilities that are more than suﬃcient to complete this program on schedule, with
extra capacity to handle additional unforeseen assays. In the following, estimates of the capacity available
to DarkSide-20k for each assay type are provided. The assay capabilities are being organized throughout
the collaboration and a detailed assay schedule will be developed as detector design matures. The assay
challenges are organized into ﬁve focus areas: mass spectrometry, radon emanation, direct gamma assay,
surface assay, and materials handling and process development.

13.3.1 Mass Spectrometry

For some radioactive contaminants, e.g. actinides like uranium and thorium, radiochemistry and mass spec-
trometry will provide superior sensitivity and will ultimately allow the assay requirements suggested by the
background model to be met. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a highly sensitive
technique that has detection limits in the parts-per-trillion (ppt) range and lower. For reference, 1 ppt is
equivalent to 12.4 µBq/kg (4.1 µBq/kg) for 238U (232Th). Samples are typically introduced to the plasma in
the form of a nebulized aerosol of liquid droplets. The 8000 K plasma eﬀectively atomizes and ionizes most
elements of the periodic table (including K, Th, and U) to the +1 charge state. The ions are then funneled
into a higher vacuum region and focused into the mass spectrometer using ion optics where they are separated
by mass and detected. ICP-MS has been around for over three decades. Its sensitivity is particularly good for
high mass elements and has improved signiﬁcantly over the last decade. High sensitivity and relatively quick
sample throughput (compared to counting methods) make ICP-MS a mainstay in the ultra-low-background

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

115

community. To reach the low detection limits required, however, sample preparation requires development
of assiduously clean wet-chemistry methods with validated eﬃciency.

Within the collaboration, many ICP-MS instruments with diﬀerent capabilities are available for coordi-
nated assay campaigns. Radiochemistry and mass-spectrometry capabilities across the collaboration will be
coordinated and scheduled to allow suﬃcient capacity to address assay needs for the most routine as well as
the most demanding of samples.

At PNNL, substantial expertise and resources are available for DarkSide-20k assay. There are two ICP-MS
instruments that are used to analyze only ultra-low background materials – this in order to keep the back-
grounds at extremely low levels. They have the capability to routinely measure sub-ppt Th and U, as well
as sub-ppb K, in a variety of materials, including polymers, Ti, Cu, and fused silica; current detection lim-
its for candidate DarkSide-20k materials are shown in Table 14. With new instrumentation, PNNL plans
to automate much of the technical processes involved in the most sensitive materials assays, primarily to
improve throughput. Additionally, their newest instrument incorporates a one-of-a-kind triple quadrupole
ICP-MS, which greatly improves analysis capabilities. The triple quadrupole function allows the removal of
problematic interferences so that increased throughput and improved detection limits can be attained.

BHSU, CIEMAT, LNGS, MSU, and PoliMi also have ICP-MS instrumentation that will aid in the
screening of candidate materials. MSU has an ICP-MS setup dedicated to U/Th assay in Ti and has performed
hundreds of assays with ppt-level sensitivity. All institutions are capable of processing samples in cleanrooms
using a variety of chemical methods (e.g., separations, electrochemical puriﬁcation, dry ashing, etc.). As
previously mentioned, PNNL can attain sub-ppt detection limits for most samples. BHSU, CIEMAT, LNGS,
MSU, and PoliMi can attain ppt to ppb detection limits. Each of the laboratories can process several samples
per week. These sensitivities and throughput give the collaboration the ability to eﬀectively and eﬃciently
screen materials for the DarkSide-20k assay program.

Other ICP-MS capabilities throughout the collaboration include ICP-MS with sample introduction by
laser ablation (LA), available at BHSU and PNNL. LA is an ICP-MS introduction method that uses a high
powered laser to ablate a sample’s surface. An aerosol of sample particulates is formed during the ablation
process that is then introduced into the ICP-MS via a carrier gas for atomization, ionization, and mass
determination. LA-ICP-MS has several advantages. Little or no sample preparation is required, which can
substantially increase throughput while also reducing the potential for contamination associated with sample
processing. Also, LA-ICP-MS allows for investigation of the contaminant distribution along the surface of
the sample. One drawback is that quantitative analysis with LA-ICP-MS requires a reference material of
the same composition as the sample and with a certiﬁed concentration of the analyte of interest in order to
directly compare responses, and the number of certiﬁed reference materials is quite limited for elements like
Th and U in polymers and metals. Nevertheless, useful semi-quantitative assays can be performed as part of
the overall DarkSide-20k assay program.

13.3.2 Radon Emanation

Rn-222 is a ubiquitous noble gas that is suﬃciently long-lived (3.8 day half-life) to be a background concern.
This is due to its high mobility (i.e., chemically inert gas) and the wide energy range and variety of radiations
emitted by its decay products. In addition, radioactive equilibrium of the 222Rn decay chain is often broken in
materials because of the long half-life (22.3 yr) of the 210Pb daughter. This makes predictions of background
caused by this isotope challenging. In many cases, the most direct and sensitive approach for controlling and
minimizing an experiment’s radon-related backgrounds is via radon emanation screening of the materials of
construction.

All parts of the detector in contact with the argon target may be considered as radon emanation sources.
All such argon-wetted components, including the cryostat, all TPC parts – photodetectors, insulators, cables
and electronics – and the gas circulation loop (i.e., tubing, getter, liqueﬁer, charcoal trap, etc.) will be
screened. It is also planned to perform a ﬁnal emanation test of the complete detector, as was done for
DarkSide-50. Using a portable cryogenic radon detector, collaborators will investigate on-site emanation
rates for all vacuum subsystems: pipes, sensors, vacuum gauges and the cryostat. Studies of 220Rn emanation
have never been performed in this context; the plan is to systematically investigate relevant materials like
stainless steel, copper and lead. Further, because welds are known to be emanation sources, diﬀerent welding
procedures will be tested by measuring materials before and after welding.

A maximum tolerable radon concentration in the LAr ﬁducial volume of the TPC will be established
through detailed Monte Carlo simulations, leading to determination of emanation limits for speciﬁc compo-
nents. One should include here eﬀects of reduced emanation at LAr temperature and removal of 222Rn by

116

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

the cooled charcoal trap in the circulation loop. These eﬀects are (generally) expected to relax the emanation
requirements, especially for non-metal components for which emanation is driven mostly by diﬀusion and is
therefore strongly suppressed at lower temperatures.

The measured DarkSide-50 radon concentration upper limit of 2 µBq/kg can be used as a conservative
limit for DarkSide-20k and corresponds to an equilibrium radon activity of 40 mBq in the LAr ﬁducial volume.
As discussed in Sec. 2, the β/γ rejection power demonstrated with DarkSide-50 is more than suﬃcient to
exclude background associated with radon at this level. In addition to DarkSide-50, several xenon-based
experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of a dual-phase TPC with such a low radon concentration
(e.g., LUX [110] and EXO-200 [171]), and it is worth noting that the Xe detectors operate at a higher
temperature and without charcoal traps in their circulation loops. Finally, relative to DarkSide-50 and the
Xe-based experiments, DarkSide-20k has a smaller surface-area to volume ratio that is expected to result in
a relatively smaller radon concentration in the LAr. Nevertheless, radon emanation is a critical component of
the DarkSide-20k assay program because all argon-wetted materials must still be screened to ensure that the
target radon level is achieved, and because radon emanation measurements provide radiopurity information
that is complementary to (and sometimes more sensitive than) the other assay methods.

Emanation assays will be conducted with existing radon emanation facilities at the Smoluchowski Institute
of Physics, Jagiellonian University in Krakow and a system currently under development at PNNL. First
samples of high-purity titanium sponge have already been screened for 220Rn and 222Rn. The PNNL system
includes a 35 L emanation chamber and a detection system that uses ultra-low background proportional
counters [172]. The expected detection limit is in the range of a few tens of µBq per sample. The Krakow
system consists of three ultra-low background emanation chambers (12 L, 50 L and 250 L) coupled to a custom
radon detector in which radon isotopes are collected via cryo-adsorption onto a small cold surface and their
subsequent decays are detected with an alpha counter that faces the collector. This cryogenic radon detector
is portable and can be attached to any vacuum vessel. In order to reduce background from self-emanation
some special solutions have been implemented. The vessels were made according to ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
standards, have electropolished inner surfaces, and are equipped with only metal-sealed valves, ﬂanges and
connectors. All chambers are equipped with UHV pumping and heating systems to allow investigation of
radon emanation as a function of temperature (controlled to within ±1 K) for positive temperatures up
to 423 K. Additionally, for radon emanation studies at cryogenic temperatures, Krakow has a dedicated
system in which the temperature of the sample can be controlled from 77 K to 373 K. All chambers have
large openings for insertion of voluminous samples. The Krakow system is unique world-wide with respect
to the design and achieved parameters; for the ﬁrst time it is possible to investigate emanation of not only
222Rn but also the short-lived 220Rn (τ 1
= 56 s) from the thorium chain. Extremely low background rates
allow for registration of single atoms emanated from samples. As demonstrated in [173], a combination of
highly sensitive radon emanation and diﬀusion measurements can also be used to determine 226Ra content in
low-density materials with signiﬁcantly better sensitivity than available with the best γ-ray spectrometers.
To assay one sample close to the detection limit (∼1 µBq per sample) about one month is needed. The
Krakow group currently operates three chambers with a possibility to extend the system with a fourth, with
at least two vessels able to be exclusively dedicated to DarkSide screening. The resulting emanation assay
capacity is at least two samples per month at the ultimate sensitivity, which would be further augmented by
including the PNNL system. This will be suﬃcient to perform all the necessary tests for the DarkSide-20k
experiment in a timely manner, including on-site tests of the gas system components.

13.3.3 HPGe γ-ray Counting

HPGe spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools for identifying γ-ray-emitters in the U/Th chains and
isotopes such as 60Co, 40K and 210Pb. Sensitivity for relatively short-lived isotopes extends to concentrations
far below detections limits obtainable by other methods. The strength of this technique comes from its
excellent energy resolution (few keV at MeV scales) and the high purity of germanium diode detectors, which
results in very low intrinsic backgrounds. External backgrounds can be eﬀectively reduced by surrounding
with layers of radiopure shielding (e.g., lead and copper) and locating the spectrometers in relatively deep
underground laboratories to attenuate the cosmic-ray ﬂux. High detection sensitivities can be achieved with
large Ge crystals and large sample chambers. Detection eﬃciencies are usually determined by Monte Carlo
simulations supported by test measurements for selected sample geometries. Rare-event searches such as
DarkSide-20k require the lowest possible radioactivity for their detector components, and low-level γ-ray
spectroscopy with HPGe detectors has been one of the main tools for low-background materials screening
over the last few decades.

HPGe spectroscopy has the advantage of being a nondestructive method that does not require complex
sample treatment. Although sometimes less sensitive than ICP-MS or neutron activation analysis, it provides
more complete information about the screened sample because the measured energy spectrum registers
contributions from a variety of radioisotopes. The most important feature, however, is the ability to directly
detect isotopes relevant to understanding the DarkSide-20k background budget. Speciﬁcally, measurement
of γ-ray-emitting progeny near the top (e.g., 228Ac and 234mPa) and near the bottom (e.g., 208Tl and 214Bi)
of the 232Th and 238U decay chains makes it possible to investigate secular equilibrium conditions, thereby
providing important complementary information to the other assay techniques described in this section.

Using MAX-R&D funds starting in 2012, a DarkSide-dedicated HPGe facility has been under development
at Temple University. This facility is now nearing completion. The detector is an ORTEC “100 %” GMX
detector of n-type Ge, allowing for a very thin entrance dead layer to accept low-energy radiation (e.g., the
46 keV x-ray of 210Pb). The cryostat is ORTEC’s “J-type” in which the cylindrical detector is mounted with
its axis vertical at the end of a 70 cm long horizontal cold ﬁnger. This allows the best shielding geometry
for very low-background work. A carbon-ﬁber endcap is ﬁtted, again enhancing the eﬃciency at low energy.
ORTEC’s ultra-low background cryostat design locates the potentially radioactive preampliﬁer and HV ﬁlter
at the origin of the cold ﬁnger, far from the detector. The detector resolution in ORTEC’s tests was 2.5 keV
FWHM at 1334 keV.

Before assembly, every internal part of the detector assembly was sent to Temple from ORTEC under
an NDA and radio-assayed at LNGS. Several internal parts were found to be active and were replaced with
known-good equivalents. These included the temperature sensor (2200 ppb Th and 4000 ppb U, replaced
with much cleaner DarkSide-50 type), alumina insulating ring (350 ppb U, replaced with specially fabricated
sapphire ring), and the stainless-steel end-cap base (13 mBq/kg 60Co, replaced with one fabricated from
pre-war ship steel provided by LNGS). In addition, a shield of ultra-low activity Pb was added between
the FET (600 ppb Th) and the detector. An initial three-day background spectrum taken at Temple in a
provisional shield was free of visible background peaks except for 511 keV annihilation radiation, possibly
from cosmogenic 68Ge in the detector itself.

A sophisticated shielding assembly was constructed to house the detector. Interlocking lead bricks of
virgin Doe Run lead formed a 20 cm thick outer shield, surrounding a 30 cm3 sample cavity lined with 5 cm
of OFHC copper. The copper was cleaned and passivated at FNAL to remove and avoid radon daughter
deposition, using a PNNL recipe [175]. Radon is excluded from the sample cavity by enclosing the entire
shield in an airtight envelope ﬂushed with boil-oﬀ nitrogen. Samples are inserted into the outer chamber of a
load lock, in which radon and other short-lived activities can decay. A built-in glove box then allows samples
to be transferred from the load lock, through the interlocking, motor driven doors of the shield, and into
the sample cavity. Yet to be completed is the 4π outer shield of borated polyethylene and a set of plastic
scintillator muon-veto counters.

13.3.4 Surface Screening

Plans are being made to carry out large-area assay at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain
with the BiPo-3 detector, which allows dedicated measurements of 208Tl (232Th chain) and 214Bi (238U chain)
contamination in thin foils with better sensitivity than a HPGe detector [176]. BiPo-3 is a unique facility
with two separate modules of thin ultra-radiopure organic plastic polystyrene-based scintillator plates coupled

118

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

with a PMMA optical guide to 5 (cid:48)(cid:48) low-radioactivity photomultipliers. It has a total sample surface area of
3.6 m2 and has been running underground since 2013 to measure the radiopurity of selenium source foils
for the SuperNEMO double-β decay experiment. The sample foils are installed between the two scintillators
and 212Bi (208Tl) and 214Bi decays are measured. The system exploits the so-called “back-to-back events”
in which there is an energy deposition from a β decay in one scintillator without a coincidence from the
opposite side, followed by a delayed α decay in the opposite side without a coincidence in the ﬁrst side. The
energy of the delayed α provides information on whether the contamination is on the surface or in the bulk of
the foil. The demonstrated intrinsic background is (1.0 ± 0.3) µBq/m2, corresponding to respective 208Tl and
214Bi sensitivities of less than 2 µBq/kg and 140 µBq/kg (at 90 % conﬁdence) for a six month measurement
that utilizes the full BiPo-3 detector. The screening campaign for SuperNEMO will be completed in 2016.
There is an agreement with the BiPo collaboration to use this large-area screening facility to perform surface
screening of samples for DarkSide-20k, including measurements of Al, Mylar, PTFE, Ti and stainless-steel
sheets. The ﬁrst measurements are planned to be carried out in 2017, with as much as 70 % of the counting
time for both modules available to DarkSide-20k.

Another large-area surface detector, the XIA UltraLo-1800 α spectrometer, is operated by the Krakow
group. It uses argon as a counting gas and can accommodate samples up to 43 × 43 cm2 in surface and
up to 3 mm thick. It is especially suitable for investigations of surface and bulk speciﬁc activities of 210Po,
which is frequently a very serious background source in low-background experiments. Surface 210Po can be
analyzed by observation of the 5.3 MeV peak while bulk 210Po generates a continuous spectrum from the
detector threshold (1.5 MeV) up to the nominal peak energy. Because the background of the detector is very
low ((45 ± 4) counts m2/day under the 210Po peak) it provides a unique possibility to study natural surface
contamination of various samples – copper, stainless steel, titanium – down to 1 mBq/m2 and in the bulk
down to 100 mBq/kg (or less, depending on the material). The instrument will also be used to investigate
surface cleaning techniques (e.g., etching and electropolishing; see also Sec. 13.5 below). This capability will
allow the DarkSide collaboration to establish speciﬁc procedures that are most eﬀective for removal of α
surface activity (mainly 210Po) from particular materials.

Due to the low counting rates observed or expected for most samples of relevance, it is reasonable to
assume that no more than three eﬀective measurements per month can be performed with the UltraLo-1800.
60 % of the detector capacity can be devoted to DarkSide-20k, therefore the collaboration can analyze at least
22 samples/yr at the detector’s ultimate sensitivity. In combination with the BiPo-3 detector, this should be
more than suﬃcient to perform all necessary studies in a timely fashion.

13.4 Targeted Assays

A targeted assay program is currently underway focused on three items of high priority for DarkSide-20k:
SiPMs produced by FBK, titanium for the LAr TPC cryostat, and sapphire substrates for the detector
module (see Sec. 5 and Sec. 7 for details on the cryostat and TPC). Each of these three components present
unique assay challenges and together illustrate the variety of methods the M&A WG is using to meet the
DarkSide-20k radiopurity requirements.

The initial assay of SiPMs produced by FBK was performed by three of the DarkSide-20k institutions that
host ICP-MS capabilities: BHSU, LNGS and PNNL. This exercise served as an initial screening of the SiPMs
and provided a cross-calibration of the assay capabilities at each site. Each lab received a set of SiPM samples
originating from the same production wafer and followed a common pre-treatment procedure deﬁned by the
M&A WG, and then they assayed the devices following their own best practices. A set of process blanks
accompanied all samples from sample preparation through analysis, and each group performed multiple
trials. This enabled estimation of detection limits, testing of sample heterogeneity, and determination of
the measurement precision achievable at each lab. There were no positive detections of U or Th among all
samples analyzed by all three labs. LNGS obtained few ppb upper limits, while BHSU measured <19 ppt and
<35 ppt for U and Th, respectively. PNNL achieved the best sensitivity, with U and Th detection limits of
<2 ppt and <0.8 ppt. These results help to inform how to distribute future assay samples to best capitalize
on the strengths and capabilities of each institution. Additionally, the Krakow group will perform a surface
assay of an entire SiPM wafer using their XIA detector (see Sec. 13.3.4) and thus provide complementary
radiopurity information.

DarkSide-20k is evaluating titanium as the construction material for the TPC cryostat. The fabrication
of radiopure Ti parts requires careful control throughout a multi-step production process. The M&A WG has
assayed samples from two of the manufacturing steps: Ti sponge and Ti plate. A sponge sample was assayed
using the GeMPI2 detector at LNGS, ICP-MS at MSU, and the Krakow radon emanation system, and all

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

labs found the activity to be below the DarkSide-20k requirement. The Ti plate has been assayed for U, Th,
and K via ICP-MS at MSU, LNGS, and PNNL. The results show that MSU has succeeded in preserving
the low level of U/Th measured in the Ti sponge through the electron beam melting and subsequent rolling
process used to create the Ti plate, with respective U and Th upper limits for both sponge and plate of
<3 ppt and <50 ppt. Assay of the Ti plate with PNNL’s new triple quadrupole ICP-MS indicates <1 mBq/kg
of 40K and a 13 ppt detection of Th (consistent with the MSU upper limit). Deploying multiple assay tools
gives the M&A WG the ﬂexibility to evaluate samples from multiple steps along the titanium production
process and to cross-check these results.

13.5 Process & Materials Development

The DarkSide collaboration will develop or modify fabrication, cleaning, handling, storage, shipping, and
assembly processes that allow materials to be incorporated into the ﬁnished detector while still meeting
all radiopurity goals. This includes considering the background impact of chemical processes such as target
puriﬁcation and working across the collaboration to identify methods to limit background associated with
exposure to dust, radon and cosmic rays.

Preliminary studies to search for metals free of bulk and surface 210Po, including tests of various surface
cleaning techniques, have already been performed. Assay of the natural α surface activity is necessary for
several reasons; alphas with degraded energy are a potential background source, and in cases of broken
equilibrium in the 226Ra decay chain (at 210Pb), only direct determination of 210Po bulk and surface activ-
ities is relevant. Ultra-sensitive screening required for veriﬁcation of 210Po (210Pb) presence (removal) was
performed with the Krakow XIA UltraLo-1800 α spectrometer (described above in Sec. 13.3.4). Advanced
pulse-shape discrimination and an additional veto guard electrode result in a background level in the region of
interest more than two orders of magnitude lower than achievable with ultra-low background semiconductor
α detectors operated underground [177].

Two cleaning techniques for metal surfaces have been studied: etching applied to copper, stainless steel
and titanium; and electropolishing of copper and stainless steel. For each test, a fresh solution of chemicals
was mixed according to material-speciﬁc recipes. Measurement of Electrolytic-Tough-Pitch (ETP) copper
sheet with the UltraLo-1800 showed some bulk 210Po but no indication of surface 210Po activity (with
an estimated upper limit of 3 mBq/m2). The etching procedure had no eﬀect on the observed bulk and
surface 210Po activities. The same result was obtained for a grade 304 stainless steel plate. In the case of
an industrial grade 2 titanium plate, signiﬁcant bulk and surface 210Po activities were measured, orders of
magnitude higher than the copper and steel samples. After etching, a reduction factor of ∼2 was observed
in the surface and sub-surface 210Po and U/Th activities, where the latter were gauged using alphas with
energy above 6 MeV. Electropolishing of a copper surface loaded with 210Po proved to be very eﬀective in
removal of this isotope, with a demonstrated reduction factor of ∼25; a similar result was obtained for a
stainless-steel surface.

Summarizing, removal of 210Po via etching is not eﬀective for copper and stainless steel, conﬁrming earlier
studies with surfaces artiﬁcially loaded with 210Po [178], whereas etching of titanium signiﬁcantly reduces its
surface and sub-surface α activities. Electropolishing of copper and stainless steel reduces the 210Po surface
activity by a large factor of up to ∼25. The results obtained so far conﬁrm abilities to assess the natural
surface and bulk α activities of 210Po and constitute a solid basis for the development of the surface cleaning
procedures required. Multi-step electropolishing of copper and stainless steel are the most promising surface
cleaning procedures and will also be studied in detail. High-purity Ti will be investigated in terms of its bulk
210Po content as well as with respect to removal of surface activity.

The impact of cosmogenic activation of detector materials will be carefully considered and cosmogenic
sources that could impact otherwise radiopure materials will be identiﬁed and mitigated. As an example,
limits for 60Co in pure copper parts (i.e., the electric ﬁeld shaping rings) will be determined.

If commercially available materials do not exist that meet materials selection criteria, or are impractical
for reasons of cost or availability, it may become necessary to develop alternatives. This might involve new
materials processing from known radiopure precursor material to avoid problematic commercial production
processes, or it may involve developing additional processing methods to clean commercial input materials
to a level that can meet materials selection criteria, as it was shown for the case of copper, stainless steel
and titanium. Similar work is ongoing at PNNL [179].

13.6 Risks and Their Mitigation

The risks to the experiment associated with the Materials and Assay program have been assessed. Below is
a list of the major risks, including the potential eﬀects of mitigation activities upon the Materials and Assay
program.

Schedule delays: Project delays may arise if screening capacity is inadequate. This risk is kept low
by utilizing and organizing all of the assay capabilities within the collaboration, as discussed in Sec. 13.2.
However, the level of risk will become critical if assay capacity is substantially decreased, which could happen
if major instrumentation availability is reduced for technical reasons or because a collaborating institution
is unable to participate in the experiment. Loss of the most sensitive and/or highest throughput methods
would be particularly problematic.

Insuﬃcient sensitivity: Not being able to assay a material to the required level would be a signiﬁcant
risk to the experiment. The most likely consequence is an increase in the experiment’s expected background
and a corresponding decrease in its sensitivity. The M&A WG, however, has access to world-leading capabil-
ities in low-level materials assay. Currently the background model has not predicted a material activity level
that is outside the reach of the assay methods available. This risk will elevate (and could become critical) if
the most sensitive assay methods become unavailable. Additionally, this risk might increase if the background
model suggests an activity requirement for a material that is below levels achievable with current technology.
The current background model, however, uses existing and already proven data for material radiopurity, and
so this is not very likely.

No assay method available: It is conceivable that a material cannot be assayed. Because all materials
can be gamma counted, this is related to the previous risk; if the mass is very small or if the chemistry needed
for ICP-MS is incompatible with the material, it is possible that an insuﬃciently sensitive assay via gamma
counting with a HPGe detector is the only available option, making the assay eﬀectively not possible. As
noted above, however, this collaboration has access to world-leading low-level materials assay with a variety
of complementary techniques; the collaboration has yet to encounter a material that cannot be assayed.

Decay-chain equilibrium is broken: Broken equilibrium in the 238U and 232Th chains is the principal
concern because assay of early-chain isotopes may not be representative of late-chain activities, resulting in
the potential for elevated background and a corresponding decrease in experimental sensitivity. The lowest
activity levels can only be reached by ICP-MS, which measures the uranium and thorium content directly
and does not measure the lower parts of the decay chains. If equilibrium is broken signiﬁcantly, and the lower
chain contains more activity than is predicted by the uranium and thorium concentrations, then the (α, n)
rate would be underestimated. This risk will be minimized by performing ICP-MS, radon emanation, and
HPGe gamma counting for the materials expected to dominate the (α, n) budget (e.g., PTFE and titanium).

14 Physics Reach

The ability to identify, measure, and reject background will ultimately deﬁne the sensitivity of direct dark
matter searches. DarkSide-20k is designed to perform a search for high mass (tens of GeV/c2 to hundreds
of TeV/c2) dark matter particles with an exposure of 100 t yr. DarkSide-20k will search for WIMPs in a
broad energy range from 30 keVnr to 200 keVnr. Fig. 82 shows the nuclear recoil energy spectra for WIMPs
interacting with argon nuclei, for various masses between 100 GeV and 100 TeV. The steeply falling rate
with increasing recoil energy means that a lower energy threshold can greatly increases sensitivity for WIMP
detection, as long as the detector still operates with a very low and well understood background. As will be
detailed in this section, the operation of DarkSide-20k in an instrumental background-free mode is possible
thanks to its outstanding rejection power for β/γ backgrounds using pulse shape discrimination (PSD),
and rejection of neutron-induced nuclear recoils by the identiﬁcation of multiple scatters thanks to the
intrinsic spacial resolution of the LAr TPC and the system of two active vetoes, similar to the ones used in
DarkSide-50.

Based on the background rejection techniques developed and demonstrated with DarkSide-50, the pro-
posed DarkSide-20k experiment will be in a position to lead the exploration of the range of WIMP masses
greater than 100 GeV/c2, especially when approaching at masses of 1 TeV/c2 and beyond (see Fig. 1), with
the highest sensitivity among the experiments that will start data taking within the next half-decade, as
shown in Table 1.

DarkSide-20k’s system of nested detectors is designed to eﬃciently reject the backgrounds described in
Sec. 2: nuclear recoils induced by radiogenic and cosmogenic neutrons, electron recoils from gamma rays
and radioactive contaminants in the LAr, and backgrounds from radon daughters deposited on detector

surfaces. Detailed simulations projecting that DarkSide-20k will be operated in an instrumental background-
free condition in the WIMP search region at the required exposure will be discussed in Sec. 14.2. These
studies have been performed using G4DS, the Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation tool developed by the
DarkSide collaboration and described in Sec. 14.1.

DarkSide-20k is an experiment designed to reach the highest sensitivity for WIMP dark matter, in the
high mass region of the WIMP-nucleon cross-section vs. WIMP mass parameter space. To provide unbiased
results for the dark matter search at the limits of sensitivity oﬀered by the detector, a blind analysis procedure
will be implemented, following an initial phase of data-taking devoted to the commissioning of the detector.
The blind analysis employed by DarkSide-20k will build upon the procedure currently being developed by
the DarkSide collaboration for DarkSide-50. In DarkSide-50, following the ﬁrst round of publications with
limited exposures collected with AAr and UAr [71,70], the collaboration has switched to a blind analysis.
The speciﬁc procedure that has been adopted for the DarkSide-50 data involves the blinding of a box,
deﬁned in the f90-S1 plane (f90, described in Sec. 14.3, is the primary PSD parameter for discrimination of
electron recoils from nuclear recoils in DarkSide-50). The box extends well beyond the ninetieth percentile
of acceptance for WIMP candidates in the WIMP energy ROI. All other data remain available for studies
of background, design of cuts, and computation of the expected survival rate of backgrounds in the blinded
region. Speciﬁc background predictions developed by the analysis will be tested by gradually opening “test
strips” within the initially blinded region but outside the WIMP search region, to better understand the
backgrounds that may be present in the box. Variants of this strategy are foreseen for use in the analysis of
the DarkSide-20k data.

14.1 Simulation Tools Description

The Monte Carlo simulation for DarkSide-20k is based on the package developed for simulation of previous
detectors of the DarkSide program: DarkSide-10 and DarkSide-50. G4DS was designed with a modular ar-
chitecture and describes the energy and time responses of each detector. It provides a rich set of particle
generators, detailed geometry descriptions, ﬁnely-tuned physical processes, and a full optical propagation
model for the photons produced by scintillation in liquid argon and liquid scintillator and by electrolumines-
cence in gaseous argon. All the components of G4DS have been subjected to very detailed validation tests
by comparison with the results of the DarkSide-50 experiment.

For the LAr TPC, the main goal of G4DS is the accurate simulation of light production, propagation,
and detection for background and signal events, in order to fully reproduce the responses of the detector in

S1, S2, and time, the three primary variables on which the discrimination of β/γ background is based. This
allows tuning of the analysis cuts and estimation of their eﬃciencies, as well as prediction of the β/γ and
nuclear recoil backgrounds.

Particular attention was given to the description of the physical processes. For electromagnetic processes,
one of the physics lists available in Geant4 (G4EmLivermorePhysics) perfectly ﬁts the energy range and the
accuracy required by the detectors of the DarkSide family. For the hadronic physics list, the requirement of
very high accuracy neutron propagation in the energy range from a fraction of an eV to a few MeV required
the deﬁnition of a custom list based on high-precision models for neutron interactions. The standard Geant4
hadronic physics list is only activated to study processes such as cosmic muon propagation and production
of cosmogenic isotopes.

The light generation in LAr and GAr is handled using a custom Geant4 physical process, since details of
atomic excitation, ionization, nuclear quenching, and electron-ion recombination eﬀects are poorly known in
argon, especially in presence of strong electric ﬁelds. A theoretical model based on an eﬀective description
of recombination was developed, which was tuned on calibration data and is able to accurately describe the
light response of DarkSide-50 in both S1 and S2.

Another critical ingredient of G4DS is the tuning of optical properties of the materials through which
light is propagated, and of the surfaces where light can be absorbed, reﬂected, or diﬀused. These parameters
were again tuned by comparisons with selected data samples from the DarkSide-50 LAr TPC.

The DarkSide-50 electronics response was simulated in detail by generating arrival time and hit channel
information for each photoelectron, and then convolving it with the typical single photo-electron time re-
sponse and adding the simulated signals to actual PMT baseline responses to include noise. The eﬀects of the
noise and resolution of SiPMs and of the associated electronics are simulated (assuming that all experimental
requirements are met). The readout planes at the top and bottom of the TPC are segmented according to
the proposed tile conﬁguration, the arrival times of photons on each tile are registered taking into account
the photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) and, if the total amplitude in a given tile is above a set threshold, the
photon is registered as a hit on that channel, assessing a dead time for the channel of 100 ns. The SiPMs
primary dark count rate (DCR), direct cross talk (DiCT), and delayed cross talk (DeCT) are fully simu-
lated by appropriately adding hits to the signal. The baseline noise of the electronics is also included and
its probability density function (PDF) is convolved with that of the signal. After signal discrimination, the
digitization is directly simulated in G4DS. The output signals can then be passed on to the full analysis
chain.

The success of G4DS was validated by its ability to reproduce the background spectra in the latest anal-
ysis of the DarkSide-50 UAr data, as well as other speciﬁc distributions measured in the the DarkSide-50
LAr TPC. As one example, Fig. 83 shows the occupancy of each PMT for both S1 and S2 signals as
measured in DarkSide-50, and compares the distributions to the predictions of G4DS. Fig. 84 compares
measured and simulated DarkSide-50 S1 light yield and the top-bottom asymmetry of S1 (deﬁned as
(S1Top−S1Bottom)/(S1Top+S1Bottom), where S1Top and S1Bottom are the sum of the top and bottom PMTs,
respectively) as a function of the vertical position in the detector. The top-bottom asymmetry of the light
yield comes from geometrical diﬀerences in the detector at the top and bottom, e.g., the gas pocket, the
grid, etc. Once again the data and G4DS simulations agree very accurately.

Another strong validation of G4DS was made when it ﬁrst detected the presence of 85Kr in the spectrum
from the UAr target in DarkSide-50. The G4DS ﬁt to the spectrum, shown in Fig. 85, would not converge
in the region of the 39Ar end point under the initial assumption of no other β component with a similar
end point. The G4DS working group found that only by adding a signiﬁcant 85Kr component would the ﬁt
converge to the data. This hypothesis was conﬁrmed by measuring the rate of coincidences due to the 0.43 %
branching ratio of 85Kr decaying to 85mRb. Not only did the G4DS analysis identify the missing spectral
component, it also measured the absolute 85Kr activity with great accuracy, as conﬁrmed by the coincidence
measurement. As Fig. 85 shows, G4DS is designed to reproduce with great accuracy the experimental features
of the DarkSide-50 spectrum with a UAr target.

A detailed description of the DarkSide-20k detector geometry was developed, based on the design detailed
in this document. During the experimental design optimization process, G4DS has often been used to extract
predictions of the absolute light yield corresponding to trial conﬁgurations, guiding the design.

G4DS has been used to calculate the light yield of DarkSide-20k in its ﬁnal conﬁguration, obtaining
the distribution shown in Fig. 86. This calculation used the optical parameters tuned on the DarkSide-50
data (plus an assumed self-absorption length of 300 m for the LAr scintillation light), the geometry of the
detector as described in this document, and assumed the 40 % overall photon detection eﬃciency quoted in
Sec. 6.1. G4DS estimates a light yield of 10 PE/keV, larger than that obtained in DarkSide-50, the result of

many technical improvements of the DarkSide-20k design, larger geometrical coverage and increased photo
detection eﬃciency for SiPMs, compared to PMTs.

For the LSV simulation, the default model for scintillation in Geant4 is suﬃcient for the electromagnetic
processes occurring in the scintillator. Simulation of the DarkSide-50 LSV photoelectron yield was tuned to
accurately represent its response to external γ-rays from calibration sources, with results as shown in Fig. 87.
For full details about the DarkSide-50 LSV tuning, see [133].

14.2 Studies of Backgrounds

The background sources can be divided into three broad categories: 1) “Internal background”–ionizing
events due to radioactive contamination and neutrino interactions in the active argon itself; 2) “External
background”–ionizing events originating from radioactivity in the TPC and cryostat materials (radiogenic
backgrounds from outside the cryostat are negligible due to the shielding provided by the veto); 3) “Cosmo-
genic background”–ionizing events originating from the residual cosmic ray ﬂux in Hall C.

As has already been discussed, the design of DarkSide-20k strongly reduces many of these backgrounds
by features such as the use of UAr as a target material, the dual-phase LAr TPC design, and the nested
detector system. To ensure that the science goals are achieved, the DarkSide Collaboration will implement
a thorough system of controls based on background modeling, process and materials development, and
materials radiopurity assay. The scope and prioritization of these activities will be informed by experience
with DarkSide-50 [70,71], collaborators’ experience with other experiments (see Refs. [69,180,181,182,183]
and references cited therein), and the experience of the low-background community in general [168,184,185,
186,110]. A full background model of the detector has been built from the G4DS Monte Carlo simulation and
is under continuous reﬁnement. The model will lead to radiological and environmental limits for all aspects
of the project, and will allow identiﬁcation of materials, systems, and processes that pose the greatest
risks. Much is already understood about the radiopurity of materials [187], techniques for removing low-
level radioactive contamination [178,175], and methods for avoiding contamination (e.g., from exposure to
radon [188,189] or dust [190]).

The current state of the background estimates for the proposed 100 t yr exposure of DarkSide-20k is

summarized in Table 16 and discussed in detail in this section.

14.2.1 Internal background

39Ar and 85Kr: Recent data from DarkSide-50 running with low-radioactivity argon shows that the
UAr contains 39Ar and 85Kr activity totaling slightly less than 3 mBq/kg. As stated previously, the DarkSide-50
run with AAr had an exposure of (1422 ± 67) kg day and accumulated 1.5 × 107 39Ar events in the WIMP
energy ROI after all standard analysis cuts except PSD. Every one of these events was eliminated when the
PSD was applied, leaving the experiment free from background and producing a lower limit for the reduction
factor of 39Ar of >1.5 × 107.
A detector with similar PSD performance and ﬁlled with UAr would have to run for 5.5 t yr to accumulate the
same number of 39Ar events, and would also be expected to be free of 39Ar background after PSD. Because
the planned exposure is a factor 19 larger than this, assuming the DarkSide-50-measured lower limit for
the reduction factor of the 39Ar leads to a case in which the experiment would not remain background-free.
Therefore the real rejection factor that can be expected must be estimated using alternative methods, such
as Monte Carlo simulations and analytic modeling. This has been done for the case of DarkSide-20k, and is
detailed later along with the explanation of the sensitivity calculation. The details of the sensitivity estimate
are presented in Sec. 14.3. In that section, the conservative assumption of the use of UAr with no further
depletion of the 39Ar is made, and those results are also quoted in Table 16.
Additionally, assuming that two passes of the UAr through Seruci-II will reduce the 39Ar by a factor of
100, there will be only about 1.8 × 106 residual decays of these isotopes in the DAr itself in the WIMP ROI
during the full exposure of 100 t yr. This would further extend the sensitivity of DarkSide-20k beyond that
which has been estimated when using just the UAr, and would mark the beginning of the procurement of
the target for a much larger detector, such as Argo.
Production of 39Ar in the UAr by cosmic rays during collection, transportation, and storage of the UAr
before its deployment into the DarkSide-20k detector have also been considered. Two codes that calculate
the production and decay yields of isotopes from nuclear reactions induced by cosmic rays were used to

126

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

calculate the production of 39Ar in the UAr during a realistic altitude and exposure history covering its ex-
traction and puriﬁcation, shipment to the Aria site, processing there, and transportation to the underground
laboratory. COSMO [191] and ACTIVIA [192] predicted 39Ar speciﬁc activities of 1.5 × 10−8 Bq/(kg day)
and 0.54 × 10−8 Bq/(kg day), respectively, much too small to be of concern.

Solar Neutrino-induced Electron Scatters: The dominant solar neutrino interaction rate would be
from neutrino-electron scattering by pp neutrinos. These occur at a rate of 200 events/(t yr) within the
DarkSide-20k energy ROI, giving 2.0 × 104 events in the 100 t yr exposure. The β/γ rejection power demon-
strated with DarkSide-50 in its AAr run [70] was better than one part in 1.5 × 107, more than suﬃcient to
reject this pp neutrino background in the DarkSide-20k exposure. This would also hold true for the 1000 t yr
exposure planned for Argo.

Neutrino-induced Nuclear Scatters: As discussed in Sec. 2, the coherent scattering of atmospheric
neutrinos from argon nuclei is an as-yet-unobserved physics process as well as an irreducible physics back-
ground to WIMP searches. 1.6 events are expected from this source in the 100 t yr exposure.

238U, 232Th, and Daughters: The radioactive noble element radon may enter and diﬀuse in the LAr
after being produced in the 238U and 232Th decay chains. The most important background contribution
comes from β decays of the radon daughters whose spectra fall partly within the energy ROI. The 222Rn
speciﬁc activity in DarkSide-50 was measured and found to be below 2 µBq/kg. With its much smaller
surface-to-volume ratio, the 222Rn concentration in DarkSide-20k is expected to be much lower than in
DarkSide-50, since radon will be coming from the detector surfaces and not the bulk. However, even if
the 222Rn contamination were at the DarkSide-50 level, only 1000 events/(t yr) from 214Pb β decays would
be expected in the energy ROI, giving 1.0 × 105 events in the total 100 t yr exposure. Once again the β/γ
rejection power demonstrated with DarkSide-50 in its AAr run [70], better than one part in 1.5 × 107, is more
than suﬃcient to eliminate this source of background from the WIMP search region at the level required for
a DarkSide-20k result free from instrumental background.

14.2.2 External background

To ensure that external backgrounds are low enough to achieve the experiment goals, the DarkSide Collab-
oration will implement a careful program of background modeling, process and materials development, and
materials radiopurity assay. The starting point for the external background budget from radioactivity is the
table of activities given in Table 13.

Radiogenic β/γ’s: The energy spectrum resulting from the radioactive β/γ decays of the detector
materials was measured quite precisely in DarkSide-50, for both the AAr and UAr data sets. The measured
spectra were found to match very well, indicating that the target itself did not contribute to this background
in a signiﬁcant way, and also showed a suﬃcient amount of self shielding by the LAr. With this results in
mind, and assuming the same level of activities as in DarkSide-50, DarkSide-20k will expect to see on the
order of 107 electron recoils events within the WIMP ROI, coming from β/γ decays of the detector materials.
Based on the discrimination power of the PSD technique to distinguish between ER and NR events that
has been estimated, it is expected that this background will not cause any leakage events to appear in the
WIMP search region, over the entire exposure of DarkSide-20k.

Radiogenic neutrons: Radiogenic neutrons are a potentially dangerous background since they cannot
be removed by PSD. They are produced by decays of radioisotopes in the materials of the detector through
(α,n) reactions and spontaneous ﬁssion, particularly from radioisotopes in the 238U and 232Th decay chains.
The very low levels of spontaneous ﬁssion occurring in the materials selected for DarkSide-20k also produce
neutrons, but G4DS simulations with activity levels measured in DarkSide-50 or expected for DarkSide-20k
show that these will be eﬃciently vetoed by the LSV, given the ﬁssion neutron multiplicity and the coincident
ﬁssion γ-rays, leaving (α,n) as the chief background.
Early G4DS studies indicated that the (α,n) reactions in the Teﬂon (PTFE) reﬂector and the cryostat were
likely to be the largest sources of neutrons, so further studies focused on these, testing several diﬀerent
conﬁgurations with 4 × 106 neutrons generated for each conﬁguration. The resulting probability for mis-
identifying a radiogenic NR as a WIMP candidate is then normalized to the 238U and 232Th activities
reported in Table 13 and the (α,n) yields in these materials, calculated with TALYS and SRIM and reported in
Table 17, to give the number of expected WIMP-like NRs appearing during the full 100 t yr of DarkSide-20k.
The neutrons generated in the PTFE and steel have been simulated using (α,n) spectra from TALYS. The
TMB concentration has been varied from 0 % to 50 % to ﬁnd the most eﬃcient LSV composition. Fig. 88
shows the simulated quenched neutron energy deposited in the LSV, including both proton recoil and neutron
capture and assuming the same alpha quenching observed in DarkSide-50.

Fig. 88. Simulated neutron energy spectrum in the LSV. The ﬁrst two peaks are the capture on 10B, and the third,
smaller, peak is the capture on hydrogen. The spectrum takes into account quenching, and it has been simulated for
diﬀerent TMB concentrations.

To use the simulation to evaluate LSV performance, a simulation of a typical TPC analysis, which would
require a single, nuclear-recoil-like scatter in a chosen ﬁducial volume, is performed. These cuts are themselves
quite eﬀective in reducing neutron-induced background. The following is required:
– The event has a single resolved interaction in the TPC;
– The interaction is nuclear-recoil-like;
– The event is contained in the WIMP energy region;
– The event is inside the ﬁducial volume chosen, varied in these studies.
The radial proﬁle of the neutron captures in simulated events passing the TPC selection shows little de-
pendence on the TMB concentration and indicates that all neutrons capture well before reaching the LSV
PMTs. While the capture location is independent of TMB concentration, the capture time depends on the
TMB concentration, as can be seen in Fig. 89.
If the total LSV rate is low enough, the cuts to tag the prompt and delayed neutron signals can have low
energy thresholds and an acceptable accidental loss. Adding more TMB shortens the capture time and thus
the LSV delayed window, lowering the thresholds at a ﬁxed accidental rate or alternatively reducing the
accidental rate with a ﬁxed threshold. In this evaluation of neutron background it is assumed that LSV
thresholds can be low enough to not aﬀect the neutron tagging eﬃciency. In the simulation, it is assumed
that events with quenched energy in the LSV <5 keV pass the veto cuts.
The simulations for neutrons originating in the Teﬂon reﬂector panels and stainless steel cryostat give the
results shown in Table 18 for a TMB concentration of 20 % and a ﬁducial cut of 7 cm. Fig. 90 shows the
surviving neutron background as a function of both the TMB concentration and the ﬁducial cut.

Surface backgrounds: α-decays on the surfaces of the active volume can also be a diﬃcult background.
About half the time, the α goes deeper into the surface, and the daughter nucleus recoils into the active
volume, mimicking a WIMP-induced nuclear recoil. Surface contamination will be minimized by carrying

out precision cleaning and assembly of the TPC in the Rn-suppressed clean rooms already constructed and
used for DarkSide-50. The inner surfaces of the TPC are coated with a wavelength shifter, which will be
applied by vacuum evaporation carried out within an extension of the radon-suppressed clean rooms. Thus
the coated surfaces will only be exposed to air that has been scrubbed of radon. DarkSide-50 studied the
light yield of alpha interaction in LAr [86], but in the end these events were all removed from the ﬁnal data
sample using simple cuts, not including a radial ﬁducial volume cut. As speciﬁed in Sec. 2, recoils from
any remaining surface activity will be suﬃciently suppressed by position reconstruction and the 7 cm ﬁducial
volume cut, along with advanced cuts looking at S1 and S2 light distributions and/or a long-lived component
of the signal coming from nuclear recoil interactions with the TPB coated PTFE panels of the TPC.

Cherenkov background: Cherenkov light is produced by β/γ interactions in materials surrounding
the LAr such as the PTFE reﬂector or the acrylic windows of the TPC. Overlaps of this prompt light in time
with an electron recoil event in the argon, for example from a gamma with multiple Compton scatters, can
appear to have a larger fast S1 component, resembling that of a nuclear recoil. Such events are rare given
the use of ultra-pure materials, and are further suppressed by analysis cuts on the spatial distribution of the
detected S1 light, which the Monte Carlo indicates to be very eﬀective, and additionally by the ﬁducial cut.

14.2.3 Cosmogenic background

Nuclear interactions of cosmic ray muons with the rock surrounding the experimental halls produce neu-
trons and other particles that potentially give backgrounds in DarkSide-type detectors. Detailed simulation
studies of these backgrounds were performed by members of the DarkSide Collaboration for Borexino, for

DarkSide-50 with its veto system, and for a 3.3 t LAr TPC with the DarkSide-50 veto system, as described
in Refs. [82,83,193]. In these simulations, FLUKA was used to predict the particle ﬂuxes produced in the
rock and incident on the experiments, starting from measured characteristics of the incident muon ﬂux at
LNGS.

The most dangerous class of background events for the WIMP search are neutron-induced nuclear recoils
in the sensitive LAr volume resulting from events which deposit little or no energy in the vetoes. To study
this category, Ref. [83] singled out all events for which at least one neutron (but < 50 coincident particles)
reached the active LAr region in their 3.3 t LAr TPC. A very conservative criterion (dELSV > 1 MeV) was
deﬁned to select events which should be considered detectable by the LSV.

A portion of the Ref. [83] simulation was repeated for the proposed geometry using the Geant4-based
simulation package. The most dangerous category of cosmogenic events was again singled out, i.e., cosmogenic
neutrons entering the water tank without accompanying charged particles (all other events are easily rejected
by the WCV). DarkSide-20k is more eﬃcient at rejecting such external cosmogenic neutrons because of the
increased sizes of the WCV and LSV. The results for an exposure greater than 1000 t yr are compatible with
no cosmogenic neutron reaching the LAr TPC and surviving application of the veto cuts.

The background estimate described above was based on cosmic ray muon-induced secondaries which are
prompt and thus can be vetoed by the outer detector systems. The cosmic ray showers can also produce
radioisotopes with lifetimes of seconds to minutes (i.e., sources of non-prompt background) in the detector
and target materials. Production and decay of these isotopes were also simulated, and their decay products
handed oﬀ to a Geant4-based Monte Carlo for simulation. Events that deposited a signiﬁcant amount of
energy in the veto detectors, interacted at more than one site inside the LAr TPC, or fell outside the energy
ROI and the ﬁducial volume were removed. On the order of 3 × 105 events survive during a full exposure of
100 t yr, all of which were β/γ events. This number is easily managed by the LAr PSD.

Based on current data and Monte Carlo simulations, the expected numbers of electron and nuclear recoil
background events surviving analysis cuts, for the full 100 t yr exposure, is given in Table 16. Note that the
Table gives an estimated External NR background greater than 0.1 event. This rate is dominated by (α,n)
production in the PTFE reﬂector panels assuming the activities in Table 13. Actual measurements of the
activity of the PTFE in DarkSide-50 produced only upper limits. The background estimate can thus be
taken as an indication that more sensitive measurements of the PTFE must be made, and that the activity

will be required to be at least a factor of ∼ 2 below the achieved upper limits. A campaign to improve the
sensitivity is underway (see Sec. 13.1).

14.3 DarkSide-20k sensitivity to WIMPs

The success of the experiment depends not only on background suppression, but also on a high detection
eﬃciency for nuclear recoil (NR) events from WIMPs. The WIMP acceptance region is designed to have a
leakage of electron recoils smaller than 0.005 events/(5-PE bin).

To determine the expected acceptance region for DarkSide-20k, 1.5 × 106 NRs in the range 1 keVnr to
200 keVnr were simulated. The simulation included the eﬀect of the measured quenching factor for nuclear
recoils in argon reported in Ref. [77], which matches the theoretical prediction of Ref. [194]. With this
quenching factor, the above NR ROI corresponds to the energy interval <1 keVee to 50 keVee (in PE) for
β’s. Additionally, 3.5 × 106 39Ar β-decays were simulated in the energy range of 7 keVee to 50 keVee. The
number of simulated ER corresponds to 1 % the expected number of 39Ar decays in the WIMP ROI for
the 100 t yr exposure using UAr (assuming the 39Ar reduction factor measured in DarkSide-50). The G4DS
simulation was performed using the optical parameters, such as the index of refraction and the reﬂectivity
of the diﬀerent surfaces, that had been tuned with the DarkSide-50 data. The light yields of β’s and NRs
were corrected for the position within the LAr TPC, based on a light yield map obtained with 83mKr G4DS
simulations. The average light yield predicted for DarkSide-20k in this study was 10 PE/keV for β/γ’s at
null ﬁeld, corresponding to 9 PE/keV at a ﬁeld of 200 V/cm.

The discrimination between β/γ and NR was then determined using the PSD of LAr. In DarkSide-50, the
discrimination parameter f90 was used, but due to the DarkSide-20k larger size and longer average distance
the light has to travel before reaching the photosensors, f90 might not be the optimal distribution, thus the
PSD performance of DarkSide-20k was simulated using four diﬀerent parameters: f90, f120, f150, and f200,
deﬁned as the fraction of scintillation light collected in the ﬁrst 90 ns, 120 ns, 150 ns, and 200 ns respectively.
The large simulated sample of ER described above is still not suﬃcient to locate a PSD cut contour
for the full exposure. To design the contour, an analytical model (to be described in a future paper) of the
three PSD parameters was ﬁt to the simulated sample and used to extrapolate to the required background
rejection. For all three parameters, an NR acceptance region was deﬁned by requiring that it contain a
leakage of less than 0.005 events/(5-PE bin) ER events (total ER background then sums to <0.1 events in
the WIMP search region), extrapolating to the full statistics of 39Ar events expected in DarkSide-20k. Note
that in this study, the use of UAr was assumed, with the depletion factor measured in DarkSide-50 and not
the additional depletion anticipated from Aria. The acceptance region was further bounded from below by
the 90 % NR detection-eﬃciency contour. As an example, the distribution of f200 as a function of S1 for β’s
and NRs is shown in Fig. 91. The lines on those plots correspond to the leakage curve for β/γ and to the
90% acceptance contour for NR.

For each of the four discrimination parameters considered, the NR acceptance band, as determined with
the procedure detailed above, is converted into a function of energy and shown in Fig. 92. The comparison
clearly favors f200. There is no gain in further lengthening the window dedicated to the counting of the fast
photoelectrons beyond the 200 ns of f200. The resulting equivalent reduction factor for 39Ar decays inside

DarkSide-20k is found to be >3 × 109, more than suﬃcient to maintain background-free operation for more
than 200 t yr.

The acceptance band of Fig. 92 is used to evaluate the sensitivity of DarkSide-20k to WIMP recoils. With
the best performing parameter, f200, a projected sensitivity of 1.2 × 10−47 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 1 TeV/c2
(1.1 × 10−46 cm2 for 10 TeV/c2) is obtained, as shown in Fig. 1. DarkSide-20k could also extend its operation
to a decade, increasing the exposure to 200 t yr, reaching a sensitivity of 7.4 × 10−48 cm2 (6.9 × 10−47 cm2)
for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2 (10 TeV/c2) mass. As shown in Table 1, DarkSide-20k will be capable of achieving
the highest sensitivity for high mass dark matter particles of any experiment currently “on the books”,
extending just beyond the reach of the two-phase liquid xenon TPC experiments.

15 Facilities and Detector Assembly

15.1 Introduction

The DarkSide-20k facility incorporates all plants, systems and subsystems involved in preparation, construc-
tion, assembly, commissioning and operations of the experiment. The major components are represented by
the three detectors: 1) the WCV, 2) the LSV, and 3) the LAr TPC contained inside the cryostat, togerther
with their readout electronics and calibration systems. The clean rooms, radon abatement system and the
ﬂuid handling plants and storage areas are considered essential facilities of the experiment. The ﬂuid han-
dling and storage plants will allow for the storage, recovery, puriﬁcartion and handling of liquids such as
LAr, LN2, scintillator and water.

The concentric design of the detector was successfully implemented in DarkSide-50. For DarkSide-50,
stainless steel-lined clean rooms were built and equipped with an active radon abatement system to reduce
the radon content in the air to the record level of 5 mBq/m3, a factor 2 × 104 below the activity in the air of
the Hall C. For DarkSide-20k, the plan is to use the ﬂoor of the water tank as a clean room assembly space.
The ﬂow of radon-suppressed air into the water tank will be provided by the radon abatement system of the
DarkSide-50 clean rooms.

15.2 The LNGS Underground Laboratory: Hall C

The Gran Sasso Underground Lab consists of three large experimental halls: Hall A, Hall B, and Hall C, and a
series of small interconnecting tunnels and service galleries. The Laboratory is equipped with central services

for distribution of fresh air, power, cooling water, and compressed air. Hall C currently hosts experiments
such as Borexino, DarkSide-50 and the MiBeta test facility and has been identiﬁed by LNGS management as
the candidate site to host the DarkSide-20k experiment. Hall C is 100 m long, 20 m wide, and has a vaulted
ceiling with 20 m height.

Hall C is equipped with three cranes: the double-hook (vaulted type) 20+20 t crane; the 25 t crane and
the 5 t crane. The perimeter of the hall is supplied with ﬂuids spill and smoke detection systems. A volatile
organic carbon detector with multiplexed sample points and a ﬁxed, foam-based ﬁre extinguisher system are
also installed in the hall.

The ﬂoor of the Hall C is waterproofed with a curb on its perimeter for mitigating any possible ﬂooding
due to the release of ﬂuids from the experiments. A metal grid placed on the ﬂoor at the south side of Hall C
allows a collection up to ∼1000 m3/h of liquid into a containment pit placed beneath the pavement. The
ventilation system provides at least ∼7000 m3/h of fresh air and keeps Hall C overpressure at a few mbar.
Fresh air is delivered on the south side and removed from the north side. All entrances to Hall C (on north,
south and east sides) are equipped with ﬁre-proof stainless steel doors.

The likely location of DarkSide-20k will be in the south part of the Hall C, where the OPERA experiment
was placed before its decommissioning. This area will also host the SABRE experiment. This location would
be optimal from a logistics standpoint, as it grants direct access to the TIR tunnel through the south entrance
of Hall C, equipped with a double-containment ﬁre-proof door that allows for truck access.

One preliminary layout of the south part of the Hall C is shown in Fig. 93. The exact layout is still under
discussion with the LNGS management, but as can be seen from the ﬁgure, the site will host the water tank
(15 m diameter and 14.65 m tall), two argon recovery tanks (9 m long and 3.2 m in diameter) and the building
for the cryogenic system (cooling tower) and all DAQ electronics (LAr TPC plus two veto detectors). A cross
section of the DarkSide-20k detector with dimensions is shown in Fig. 94. Fig. 95 shows a 3D rendering of
the two veto detectors (WCV and LSV).

The water tank will have a 7.5 × 6.0 m2 manhole as a main entrance, to provide maximal access. The
bottom of the tank will be equipped with a 8 cm thick stainless steel slab in order to provide additional
shiedling against gamme-rays from the Hall C ﬂoor. The stainless steel sphere will have a 1.0 m diameter
ﬂange at the top for the process tubing, and a 6.6 m diameter ﬂange to provide access for the insertion of
the LAr TPC (see Fig. 94 for dimensions). At the bottom of this 6.6 m ﬂange, a 1.0 m diameter ﬂange will
be added for the feedthroughs of the liquid cryogenic and scintillator lines.

The design of the cryostat follows closely that of the successful DarkSide-50 cryostat: a 4π vacuum-
insulated vessel made of three separate parts, the top assembly (two concentric caps), the inner cryostat
vessel, and the vacuum insulation vessel (external sheel). The baseline material for the cryostat is stainless

steel, however, the collaboration is actively pursuing building the cryostat from ULR titanium, more details
on the cryostat design and the ULR titanium can be found in Sec. 5.5.

The cryostat supporting and leveling system will mirror the successful experience of DarkSide-50: the
cryostat will be suspended from a system of three rods, going all the way up from the cryostat to the top
of the water tank. Leveling of the cryostat will be adjusted by turning the rods, with the precision of a
fraction of a mm over the diameter of the LAr TPC. A study of the response of the system to seismic events
is ongoing together with careful analysis of the mechanical design optimization in order to guarantee full
compliance with the anti-seismic regulations.

The DarkSide detectors require extraordinarily low background levels.
Thanks to essential support from the NSF, DOE and INFN, the Borexino and DarkSide Collaborations
were able to build a set of facilities that allowed the development and operation of such low background
detectors underground. These facilities playes a crucial role in the scientiﬁc success of DarkSide-50. Below is
the list of the facilities which the DarkSide-20k experiment intends to use:

High Purity Water Plant: The Borexino water puriﬁcation plant is intended to be used to ﬁll the
2000 t water tank. The plant consists of a special low pressure degassing system, a cascade of reverse osmosis
columns, a deionizer, a set of ultra-Q ﬁlters, and a radon stripping column. It is capable of producing
ultra-high purity water at the rate of 1 m3/h.

Cleaning Module: The cleaning module is a dedicated plant used to perform pickling, passivation,
and precision cleaning, by recirculating heated acid and chelating solutions through the components to be
cleaned.

Scintillator Storage: The Borexino scintillator storage consists of four 100 m3/h vessels formerly used
for storage of the DarkSide scintillator. Two empty tanks will be enough to store the scintillator for the LSV.
Puriﬁcation Plants: Over the span of 20 years, the Borexino collaboration has developed a very so-
phisticated set of process-plants for scintillator puriﬁcation. In order to prevent possible contamination of
these delicate Borexino systems, the DarkSide collaboration procured an independent set of small puriﬁca-

tion units (distillation, N2 stripping) capable of treating the scintillator (or its individual components) at a
rate of 0.1 m3/h. The plan is to keep using the same unit for scintillator puriﬁcation, with the possibility for
upgrading the present system.

Buildings: The Borexino Big Building West (BBW) houses the DarkSide control room and the counting
room for the muon and neutron veto. The Borexino Big Building East (BBE) houses the DarkSide scintillator
puriﬁcation units, the DarkSide scintillator buﬀer tank, and the interconnection system between the DarkSide
scintillator loop and the Borexino scintillator puriﬁcation plants.

Radon Abatement System: The DarkSide collaboration has installed and commissioned an air treat-
ment unit which processes Hall C air at a rate of 230 m3/h, reducing radon by a factor greater than 1 × 105.
This radon-suppressed air is then delivered to the DarkSide clean rooms with residual 222Rn activity below
the level of 1 mBq.

Radon-Suppressed Clean Rooms: Nuclear recoils from α decays on the innermost surfaces of dark
matter detectors are a pernicious source of background for direct dark matter searches, and the daughters of
radon on these surfaces are the biggest source. The DarkSide collaboration has built two radon-suppressed
clean rooms in Hall C, see Fig. 96. These rooms receive air from the radon abatement system and are lined
with stainless steel panels to limit radon emanation from the walls. The concentration of radon in the clean
rooms is below 5 mBq/m3 (a factor 2 × 104 suppression relative to the Hall C air).
The ﬁrst 222Rn suppressed clean-room (<1 Bq/m3 of air) in the world was built at Princeton University in
1998–99 for the construction of the Borexino nylon vessels, achieving surface activities of <10 α’s/(m2·d) [195],
also achieved later for the SNO NCD detectors [196]) and the NEMO experiment [197]. The DarkSide clean
rooms have reached a 222Rn level lower than the Princeton clean room by more than two orders of magni-
tude. The clean room CR1 contains the equipment used for the cleaning and preparation of the DarkSide-50
LAr TPC parts: the already mentioned HDPE tank and ultrasonic cleaning bath; an Ultra-High-Vacuum
(UHV) evaporator (vacuum chamber: 127 cm diameter, 84 cm height, baseline vacuum: 10−8 mbar) to coat
the innermost surface of the LAr TPC with TPB wavelength shifter; and a vacuum oven (66 × 66 × 66 cm3).

with the UHV evaporator for TPB coating of detectors’ internals visible at left of center. Right: The exterior of the
assembly clean room CRH on the top of the CTF water tank, housing DarkSide-50.

The clean room CRH is located on top of the water tank and gives direct access into the vetoes through their
top ﬂanges. It has a 6 m vertical clearance, and is served by a 5 t crane to permit assembly and installation
of the DarkSide-50 LAr TPC in a radon-free environment.

Radon Detector The DarkSide collaboration, has installed and commissioned an electrostatic 222Rn
detector (see Refs. [198,199]). The detector consists of a stainless steel chamber in which a silicon diode
α detector is electrically biased to act as an ion collection electrode, attracting mobile α-emitting radon
daughters. Samples are introduced via intake and exhaust plumbing, a sampling pump (which can also be
run in recirculation mode) and a drier for the input air stream. The care in design and construction allowed
the sensitivity goal of about 100 µBq/m3 needed to monitor the Radon-suppressed air to be achieved. The
chamber is connected through a manifold to the output of the radon abatement system and to the CR1 and
CRH clean rooms, so that it can continuously monitor 222Rn levels at the output of the radon abatement
system or directly in the two clean rooms.

Gas Exhaust Plant: All gas exhausts coming from within the lab are connected to a negative pres-
sure which directs all the exhaust gases through a carbon ﬁlter and puriﬁed before being released to the
environment (motor way tunnel).

Blow Down: All liquid scintillator vapors coming from bursting discs of the liquid scintillator storage
tanks and other containers are collected and recovery into a tank ﬁlled with ∼8 m3 of water and a no-
structural packing metal ring.

Nitrogen Supply System: Hall C is equipped with three diﬀerent LN2 supplies, shared by the Borexino
and DarkSide-50 experiments: regular nitrogen (RN2), high purity nitrogen (HPN), and low Ar/Kr Nitro-
gen (LAKN). All the LN2 systems are housed just outside of Hall C in the underground lab. The RN2
storage is a 30 m3 conventional liquid nitrogen storage tank with a heater to provide boil oﬀ nitrogen for
pneumatic instrumentation, routine purging of gas lines. The HPN is mainly used for the gas blankets in
the Borexino/DarkSide-50 PC storage area, in the gas stripping operations of the water, as well as in other
operations. Radon is being removed from the regular nitrogen by adsorption onto a low temperature adsor-
ber (LTA), i.e. high purity activated carbon adsorbent at 77 K, to reduce the 222Rn concentration in the
nitrogen by approximately a factor of 100. The LTA facility is installed in the entryway to Hall C. The
LAKN is special nitrogen tested to have much lower levels of Ar and Kr than found in standard commercial
liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen does not need any further puriﬁcation and is supplied to the Hall C gasiﬁed by
a heater. This nitrogen is used for blanketing of the scintillator, for gas stripping of pseudocumene during
puriﬁcation and as a service nitrogen for the DarkSide-50 cryogenic system.

15.3 Detector Assembly and Installation Sequence

The complete assembly of the detectors (water tank, stainless steel sphere, and cryostat) will start with
the realization of all the foundation anchor points for the water tank, followed by the construction of the
water tank itself. The LSV stainless steel sphere will then be built inside the water tank, by welding in place
pre-formed stainless steel sheets brought into the water tank through the manhole, like was done during

136

the DarkSide-50 construction. The material for the stainless steel sphere, legs and reinforced beams will be
carefully screened, as done for DarkSide-50.

As was mentioned before, considering the larger size of the LAr TPC, it is foreseen to turn the water
tank into a clean room in order to house the ﬁnal assembly. Therefore, once the water tank and the stainless
steel sphere will be ready for the LAr TPC assembly and cryostat insertion, they will be connected with
the radon abatement system already installed in Hall C. Special removable tents and HEPA ﬁlters will be
utilized to create a clean environment before entering the two main vessels.

Just before the assembly of the TPC and its insertion into the cryostat, the interior walls of the stainless
steel sphere will be covered with highly-reﬂective Lumirror, the same material placed on the interior of the
DarkSide-50 LSV. The water tank interior walls and the exterior walls of the stainless steel sphere will be

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

137

covered with the reﬂective material Tyvek. The cabling installation, the water tank 20 (cid:48)(cid:48) PMTs, the Tyvek
installation to cover the internal surface and all the remaining components will be installed during the ﬁnal
phase of installation and before starting the liquid ﬁll tests.

The 6.6 m LSV ﬂange will be located on the bottom of the sphere, allowing for the TPC assembly to be
done at the ground level of the water tank. The installation sequence for the cryostat is pictured in Fig. 97.
In order to move the cryostat, it is foreseen to use a temporary rail system to transport the cryostat ﬁrst into
the water tank, then under the stainless steel sphere, where it would then be anchored to the main 20+20 t
crane to be lifted in its position at the center of the stainless steel sphere. At that point the connections
of the LAr TPC with the cryogenic,DAQ systems will be performed. The PMTs installation in the water
tank and in the stainless steel sphere and the cabling installation will be performed during the ﬁnal phase
of detector installation and before global leak teass and liquid ﬁll tests are performed.

16 Broader Impacts of the DarkSide Collaboration

The technologies developed by the DarkSide Collaboration for the DarkSide-50, DarkSide-20k, and Argo
programs beneﬁt society at large in a variety of ways. Listed below are major broader impact items from
the DarkSide program and related activities:

Technologies for Medical Diagnostics: INFN and Princeton University ﬁled patent P137IT00 for an
innovative high-deﬁnition 3D Positron annihilation vertex Imager: 3Dπ. The 3Dπ Project has been conceived
to develop the technology described in this patent, aimed at overcoming the limitations of Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) and Time-Of-Flight PET (TOF-PET), nuclear imaging techniques used in the ﬁght
against cancer and imaging of other metabolic processes, such as neurological-imaging and cardio-imaging.
The market for PET and TOF-PET machines is valued in the hundreds of million of dollars per year and
is expanding rapidly. With traditional PET and TOF-PET machines, poor resolution in the time of ﬂight
measurement of the two γ-rays from positron annihilation inhibits the direct reconstruction of the 3D position
of the individual “vertex” - the point where the positron annihilates and the gamma-rays are generated.
Therefore PET and TOF-PET machines reconstruct clinical images by 2D tomography: ﬁrst determining
the 2D projections in surfaces perpendicular to the γ-rays line of ﬂight, then combining and ﬁtting the
2D projections obtained for diﬀerent angles to reconstruct the 3D image. As a consequence, resolution,
contrast, and brightness of clinical images obtained with PET and TOF-PET machines are sub-optimal. A
3Dπ machine would, event-by-event, directly reconstruct the 3D position of each individual vertex, i.e. the
location where positron annihilation occurs. If developed and commercialized, a 3Dπ machine would turn
into an extremely powerful weapon in the ﬁght against cancer. The key technological advances of 3Dπ are:
i) the replacement of crystal scintillators with doped liquid argon, which couples fast decay time with

excellent scintillation light yield;

ii) the replacement of traditional PMTs with SiPMs;
iii) and the operation of SiPMs at cryogenic temperature (87 K), optimal to minimize the noise of SiPMs.
A resolution of 30 ps in the Time-Of-Flight measurement with 3Dπ is anticipated. The development of 3Dπ
is synergistic with the DarkSide program with which is shares the LAr target and cryogenic SiPMs. A
30 ps timing resolution is the key element enabling the direct, 3D reconstruction of each individual positron
annihilation vertex. Reaching this long-sought milestone would be nothing short of a quantum jump for
nuclear imaging.
The unique capabilities unlocked by 3Dπ include:
(a) Ability to obtain clinical images with ∼ mm resolution, allowing oncologists to detect smaller tumors

and to more precisely deﬁne their position, size and shape;

(b) Ability to improve the SNR of commercial TOF-PET units, producing brighter and higher contrast
clinical images. This would allow the radiation doses administered to patients to be reduced, typically
to 0.1 mSv instead of 10 mSv per clinical exam. This is of special signiﬁcance for pediatric patients, who
may be subjected to multiple checkup imaging exams in their post-surgery life span;

(c) Ability to precisely identify position of misfolded proteins (Amyloid-beta, Tau, Alpha-Synuclein, etc.)
with long-latency (decades) accumulation time, possibly responsible for the onset of neurodegenerative
disorders, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Very low-dose tracers for these proteins could be
used in healthy subjects for preventive and therapeutic strategies;

(d) Ability to precisely determine the diﬀerential dose delivered to cancerous vs. healthy cells during hadrother-
apy sessions. This revolutionary capability, described in patent P137IT00, would be achieved by injecting
patients with special, cancer cell-targeting tracers prior to the therapy session. These tracers would be

138

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

loaded with stable (non-radioactive) isotopes selected for the propensity to be activated into positron
emitters by the hadron beam delivered during therapy.

SiPMs for Science and Society: The focus on development of SiPMs for DarkSide-20k will drive
substantial improvement in this recent and very promising technology. SiPMs have the potential of positively
aﬀecting many applications in a wide variety of ﬁelds: SiPMs could replace PMTs in many particle physics
experiments, especially those with the option of operating SiPMs at cryogenic temperatures, in magnetic
environments and in the presence of strong electric ﬁelds; SiPMs could outﬁt future generation of detectors
in use for national security purposes; The functional unit of SiPMs, the SPAD, ﬁnds application in fast
light detectors such as those in use for distance sensors in cars. Support for DarkSide-20k will directly and
indirectly support this entire range of technologies.

4He: Helium is a non-renewable resource, which is essential for many high-tech industries and for scien-
tiﬁc research. It plays a strategic role, as it is an indispensable resource for national defense projects and the
space exploration industry. Helium is abundantly used at university laboratories and by high-tech industry,
with no viable substitute. The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) operates the National Helium Reser-
voir at Amarillo, the sole government helium storage reservoir, and its webpage lists industrial processes
depending on helium and identiﬁes government users that are potentially aﬀected by helium shortages [200].
With helium in high and rising demand since the end of the ﬁnancial crisis, many U.S. universities and lab-
oratories are experiencing rising prices and cutbacks in their helium deliveries. The DarkSide Collaboration
has extracted UAr from underground CO2 wells at the Kinder Morgan Doe Canyon facility in southwestern
Colorado since 2008, measured its He and 39Ar content, and enabled the realization of the ﬁrst commercial,
large-scale extraction of underground helium. Air Products built a helium production plant treating the
entire CO2 stream produced by Kinder Morgan at Cortez [201]. Production started in July 2015 and will
replace a 15 % fraction of the declining helium production from the National Helium Reservoir.

3He: DarkSide researchers have started research on methods to separate 3He from massive streams of
helium, e.g. the one at DOE Canyon inaugurated in 2015. If successful, this eﬀort could help solve possible
future shortages of 3He [202]. 3He is very rare and ﬁnds applications in nuclear fusion and neutron detection.
It is also a hard to replace component of dilution refrigerators with base temperature in the a few mK range.
In addition, Happer and colleagues developed the technique of lung imaging with hyperpolarized 3He [203],
whose practical deployment, which crucially depends on developing large scale 3He production processes,
could signiﬁcantly enhance early detection of diﬀerent types of lung diseases.

37Ar: The noble gas radioisotope 37Ar is of great interest in the detection of underground nuclear tests.
The production of 37Ar via the reaction 40Ca(n,α)37Ar has a relatively high cross section and is expected
to provide a signature of large numbers of neutrons interacting with the soil [204]. As a noble gas, 37Ar is
expected to migrate to the surface following an underground nuclear test, without chemical eﬀects. With
a 35.04 day half-life, it is long-lived enough to allow time for soil-gas sampling to occur, but is expected to
be present at relatively low levels in normal soil gas. It is present in the atmosphere only in trace amounts.
37Ar detection is quite challenging, as it decays via electron capture, emitting low-energy Auger electrons
and X-rays. Perhaps the most well-known high-sensitivity measurement of 37Ar was performed as a means
of measuring the solar neutrino ﬂux incident on the Earth [205]. The major emissions of 37Ar decay are
summarized in that work. Nominally, only two K-capture decay channels are important, both with total
energy summing to 2.82 keV. In one, 81.5 % of decays yield only Auger electrons summing to 2.82 keV.
This is the easiest decay channel to detect, as the electrons will not range far in gases used in typical
proportional counters. Thus, full-energy detection eﬃciency for the Auger electron emissions will be high. In
the second decay channel of interest, an additional 8.7 % of decays yield 2.82 keV mostly or completely as
X-rays. The eﬃciency for detecting the full energy of these X-ray emissions will vary with the proportional
counter operating pressure and geometry; at 7 bar to 10 bar argon pressure of the PNNL measurements, the
detection eﬃciency is high. The ideal laboratory capability would be for an 37Ar measurement to extend into
the expected soil gas background range of about 1 mBq/m3 to 200 mBq/m3 of air [204], and would provide
suﬃcient capacity so that worldwide background characterizations could be supported. Several laboratories
worldwide have this capability. In the last decade, a need has been identiﬁed for a U.S.-based eﬀort, focused
on 37Ar and having both the desired sensitivity and capacity for many parallel measurements. Filling this
gap was one of the motivations for the recent development of a shallow underground laboratory [206] and
new proportional counter design [207] at PNNL. In this treaty veriﬁcation application, the chemistry of
argon recovery and puriﬁcation is important for preparing soil-gas samples for measurement. This chemistry
is synergistic with the challenge of recovering and purifying geologic argon for use in a dark matter detector.
PNNL’s focus on 37Ar for detection of underground nuclear tests [207], as well as their focus on 39Ar as

The DarkSide Collaboration: DarkSide-20k

an age-dating tracer of aquifer residence time, are natural technical complements to a scientiﬁc interest in
detecting and elucidating the nature of dark matter with a LAr detector.

39Ar: Internal-source argon gas-proportional counters are used to detect isotopes useful as environmen-
tal radiotracers. This is one of the most sensitive methods for routine assay of challenging radionuclides like
tritium [208] and 39Ar for the age-dating of water [191]. As with dark matter detection, the 39Ar background
in atmospheric-sourced argon becomes an important limit to sensitivity. The availability of geologic argon
from methods developed for DarkSide will extend the reach of these low-level measurements and thus their
application for tracers of environmental processes such as groundwater residence time. A U.S.-based eﬀort
has been established at PNNL for ultra-low-level proportional counter measurements of argon for water
reserve characterization (e.g., groundwater mean residence time) using argon radioisotopes. 39Ar is a cos-
mogenic isotope found at a constant, but low [68], concentration in atmospheric argon, which makes up
about 1 % of the atmosphere. It is thus present as a dissolved gas in rainwater and snow which recharges
aquifers. Once in an aquifer, and thus isolated from exchange with the atmosphere, 39Ar radioactive decay
decreases its abundance. The 269-year half-life of 39Ar, compared to the 12.4-year half-life of tritium, can
allow determination of the age of groundwater sources over an important range spanning 50 to 1000 years.
This allows study of eﬀects on the time-scale of impacts expected due to modern climate change patterns.
Geologic argon samples from the DarkSide collaboration R&D eﬀort have been recently used at PNNL to
characterize ultra-low-background proportional counter [209,172] backgrounds. The minimal level of 39Ar
activity in the low-radioactivity UAr allows detector background signals to be elucidated. This established
the magnitude of the eﬀect of the 39Ar signal versus limiting backgrounds, and allowed for age-dating to be
estimated for modest-sized samples, see Fig. 98 [210]. The geologic argon development work central to the
physics reach of DarkSide will signiﬁcantly enhance the ability of researchers worldwide to employ 39Ar as
an environmental radiotracer for hydrologic transport. An enduring U.S. source of geologic argon to support
environmental science applications does not currently exist, but is an opportunity that can be developed
from the DarkSide argon recovery and puriﬁcation progress. Researchers at PNNL are currently supported
by the U.S. National Nuclear Security Agency to develop plans to address this need for access to geologic
argon, in collaboration with DarkSide.

Fig. 98. Age-dating reach for small (630 std cm3) argon samples to be recovered from groundwater. These measure-
ments depend on using geologic argon as an age-dating endpoint, i.e., a detector background reference, and as a
“make-up” gas for smaller samples. Bars indicate 1σ uncertainty in sample age for ﬁve diﬀerent groundwater age
targets.

Ultra-Pure Gases: Technologies for gas puriﬁcation are extremely important in some market segments,
such as the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries. The Aria distillation columns have a unique
capability to produce high-purity gases thanks to their thousands of equilibrium stages. Perfection of this
technology could help special applications of interest to the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries.

Electronics and Microelectronics: With the ever-shrinking size of transistors in memory elements
and processors, multi-bit ﬂip due to natural and cosmogenic radioactivity is a growing concern of the semi-
conductor industry. The radon-abated CR1 and CRH clean rooms, with their world-leading 5 mBq/m3 limit
on Rn activity, could beneﬁt studies to characterize and minimize surface α-emitter contamination on silicon

chips. A viable measurement technique for surface α-emitter contamination that makes use of silicon CCDs
was recently introduced in Ref. [169] and could be useful for this purpose.

IV Generation Nuclear Plants: The Aria cryogenic distillation columns for isotopic separation will
have the ability to separate 15N from atmospheric nitrogen gas, nitric oxide or ammonia. Uranium nitride
15Nm ) is among the best candidates for fueling of IV Generation nuclear reactors, due to its superior
(Un
thermal and mechanical properties [211,212,213]. The main drawback is that uranium nitride must be
synthesized from 15N with purity greater than 99 %, to avoid neutron absorption on 14N and obtain an
overall optimal neutron economy of operation. The advantage of uranium nitride fuels is that they allow a
decreased frequency of refueling shutdowns and thus higher up-time and greater economy. The higher density,
higher melting temperature, better thermal conductivity, and lower heat capacity [214,215] compared with
e.g. oxides, help improve the safety margin in reactor design [216]. The adoption of uranium nitride as the
fuel of choice for IV Generation nuclear reactors would create a new market for 15N, valued in the hundreds
of millions of dollars per year.

Precision cleaning: The custom precision cleaning facility developed for cleaning DarkSide mechanical
parts in the clean rooms, achieved benchmarks for cleanliness and cleanliness certiﬁcation. The European
market for precision cleaning is comparatively underdeveloped. This represents a unique opportunity for the
creation of a high-technology startup in Italy, in particular in the L’Aquila district, based on technology
already proven and demonstrated. This technology is not only of interest in the aerospace industry, but in
the pharmaceutical one as well.

ULR Ti The techniques for producing ultra-low radioactivity (ULR) Ti being explored for use in
DarkSide may yield results of interest for the aerospace, electronics, and optics industries. It is intended
to exploit the potential of these technologies in cooperation with private partners in Italy, speciﬁcally in the
Abruzzo Region.

Nuclear Medicine: There has been great interest in augmented means of production for 18O and 13C,
used as precursors of tracer isotopes for tumor therapy, clinical studies, and development of new drugs.
The development of the Aria cryogenic distillation columns for isotopic separation will lead the way to new
methods of producing these important isotopes.

The DarkSide Collaboration would like to thank LNGS and its staﬀ for invaluable technical and logistical support.
