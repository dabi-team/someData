The E12-14-012 experiment, performed in Jeﬀerson Lab Hall A, has collected exclusive electron-
scattering data (e, e(cid:48)p) in parallel kinematics using natural argon and natural titanium targets.
Here, we report the ﬁrst results of the analysis of the data set corresponding to beam energy
2,222 GeV, electron scattering angle 21.5 deg, and proton emission angle −50 deg. The diﬀerential
cross sections, measured with ≈4% uncertainty, have been studied as a function of missing energy
and missing momentum, and compared to the results of Monte Carlo simulations, obtained from a
model based on the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation.

INTRODUCTION

Jeﬀerson Lab experiment E12-14-012 was primarily
aimed at obtaining the proton spectral function (SF) of
the nucleus 40Ar from a measurement of the cross section
of the (e, e(cid:48)p) reaction

e + A → e(cid:48) + p + (A − 1)∗,

in which the scattered electron and the knocked out pro-
ton are detected in coincidence. Here A denotes the tar-
get nucleus in its ground state, while the recoiling (A−1)-
nucleon system can be either in the ground state or in
any excited state.

Nucleon knockout processes have long been recognized
as being ideally suited to study the momentum and re-
moval energy distribution of protons bound in atomic
nuclei [1]. Compared to the pioneering studies carried
out using proton beams, see, e.g., Ref. [2], (e, e(cid:48)p) exper-
iments have clear advantages, because they are largely
unaﬀected by strong initial and ﬁnal state interactions
(FSI) between the beam particle and the target, and
give access to the properties of deeply bound protons

in medium-mass and heavy nuclei [3].

Under the basic assumption that the scattering pro-
cess involves individual nucleons, and neglecting FSI be-
tween the outgoing proton and the spectator nucleons,
the momentum and removal energy of the knocked out
particle, p and E, can be reconstructed from measured
kinematical variables, and the cross section of the pro-
cess is written in simple factorized form in terms of the
spectral function of the target nucleus, P (p, E), trivially
related to the nucleon Green’s function, G(p, E), through

P (p, E) =

1
π

Im G(p, E).

(2)

As a consequence, the spectral function—yielding the
probability to remove a proton with momentum p from
the target nucleus leaving the residual system with exci-
tation energy E − Ethr, with Ethr being the proton emis-
sion threshold—can be readily obtained from the data.

Signiﬁcant corrections to the somewhat oversimpliﬁed
scheme outlined above—referred to as Plane Wave Im-
pulse Approximation, or PWIA—arise from the occur-
rence of FSI. The large body of work devoted to the
analysis of (e, e(cid:48)p) data has provided convincing evidence
that the eﬀects of FSI can be accurately included by re-
placing the plane wave describing the motion of the out-
going proton with a distorted wave, eigenfunction of a
phenomenological optical potential accounting for its in-
teractions with the mean ﬁeld of the residual nucleus.
In general, the (e, e(cid:48)p) cross section computed within
this approach, known as Distorted Wave Impulse Ap-
proximation, or DWIA, involves the oﬀ-diagonal spectral
function, and cannot be written in factorized form [4].
However, an approximate procedure restoring factoriza-
tion, referred to as factorized DWIA, has been shown to
yield accurate results in the case of parallel kinematics,
in which the momentum of the outgoing proton and the
momentum transfer are parallel [5]. In this kinematical
setup, the spectral function can still be reliably obtained
from (e, e(cid:48)p) data after removing the eﬀects of FSI.

Additional corrections to the PWIA arise from the dis-
tortion of the electron wave functions resulting from in-
teractions with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus. How-
ever, it has been shown that, for nuclei as heavy as 40Ca,
this eﬀect can be accurately taken into account using an
eﬀective momentum transfer [6].

Systematic measurements of (e, e(cid:48)p) cross sections in
the kinematical regime in which the recoiling nucleus
is left in a bound state, performed at Saclay [7] and
NIKHEF-K [8], have allowed the determination of the
spectral functions of a broad set of nuclei. These studies
have provided a wealth of information on the energies and
momentum distributions of shell-model states belonging
to the Fermi sea of the target nuclei, showing at the same
time the limitations of the mean-ﬁeld description and the
importance of correlation eﬀects [1].

Besides being a fundamental quantity of nuclear many-
body theory, containing important dynamical informa-
tion, the spectral function is a powerful tool, allowing

2

to obtain the cross sections of a variety of nuclear scat-
tering processes in the kinematical regime in which the
beam particles primarily interact with individual nucle-
ons, and FSI can be treated as corrections. Applications
to inclusive electron-nucleus scattering have oﬀered vast
evidence that the formalism based on spectral functions
provides a comprehensive and consistent framework for
the calculation of nuclear cross sections in a broad kine-
matical region, extending from quasielastic (QE) scat-
tering to resonance production and deep-inelastic scat-
tering [9–11].

Over the past several years, a great deal of work has
been devoted to applying the spectral function formal-
ism to the study of neutrino-nucleus interactions, whose
quantitative understanding is needed for the interpreta-
tion of accelerator-based searches of neutrino oscillations,
see, e.g., Refs. [12, 13]. In this context, it should be noted
that the capability to describe a variety of reaction chan-
nels within a uniﬁed approach is a critical requirement,
because the energy of the beam particles is distributed
according to a broad ﬂux, typically ranging from a few
hundreds of MeV to a few GeV. Moreover, the knowledge
of the spectral function greatly improves the accuracy of
reconstruction of the neutrino energy, a key quantity in
the oscillation analysis [14, 15].

Realistic models of the nuclear spectral functions have
been obtained from the approach based on the local den-
sity approximation, or LDA, in which the information on
the shell-model structure extracted from (e, e(cid:48)p) data is
combined to the results of accurate calculations of uni-
form nuclear matter at various densities [10]. The ex-
isting calculations of neutrino-nucleus cross sections em-
ploying LDA spectral functions [11, 14, 16–26], however,
are limited to the isospin-symmetric p-shell targets 16O
and 12C. Therefore, the results of these studies are ap-
plicable to experiments using water- ˇCerenkov detectors,
e.g. Super-Kamiokande [27], and mineral oil detectors,
e.g. MiniBooNE [28].

The analysis of the data collected by the ongoing and
future experiments using liquid-argon time-projection
chambers, notably the Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino
program (SBN) [29] and the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) [30], will require the extension of
this approach to the case of a heavier target with large
neutron excess. Moreover, in DUNE the proton and neu-
tron spectral functions will both be needed, to extract the
Dirac phase δCP from a comparison of neutrino and an-
tineutrino oscillations, and achieve an accurate descrip-
tion of pion production on protons and neutrons.

In the absence of direct measurements, information on
the neutron momentum and removal energy distribution
18Ar can be inferred from Ti(e, e(cid:48)p) data, exploiting
in 40
the correspondence between the proton spectrum of ti-
tanium, having charge Z = 22, and the neutron spec-
trum of argon, having A − Z = 22. The viability of
this procedure is supported by the results of Ref. [31],
whose authors have performed a calculation of the in-
clusive 40Ar(e, e(cid:48)) and 48Ti(e, e(cid:48)) cross sections within

the framework of the self-consistent Green’s function ap-
proach. The aim of Jlab experiment E12-14-012, is the
determination of the proton spectral functions of argon
and titanium from the corresponding (e, e(cid:48)p) cross sec-
tions.

In this article, we present the ﬁrst results of our analy-
sis. In Sec. II we discuss the kinematic setup, the detec-
tors and their resolutions, and our deﬁnitions of signal
and backgrounds. In Sec. III we introduce the missing
energy and the missing momentum, which are the fun-
damental variables of our analysis, and discuss the main
elements of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations employed
for event simulation. Sec. IV is devoted to the uncer-
tainties associated with our analysis, while in Sec. V the
measured missing energy and missing momentum distri-
butions are compared with the MC predictions. Finally,
in Sec. VI we summarize our work and draw the conclu-
sions.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experiment E12-14-012 was performed at Jeﬀer-
Inclusive (e, e(cid:48)) and exclusive
son lab in Spring 2017.
(e, e(cid:48)p) electron scattering data were collected on targets
of natural argon and natural titanium, as well as on cali-
bration and background targets of carbon and aluminum.
The average neutron numbers calculated according to the
natural abundances of isotopes are 21.98 for argon and
25.92 for titanium [32]. Therefore, from now on we will
refer to the targets considered here as 40Ar and 48Ti, for
brevity.

The E12-14-012 experiment used an electron beam of
energy 2.222 GeV provided by the Continuous Electron
Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jeﬀerson Lab.
The average beam current was approximately 15 µA for
the 40Ar target and 20 µA for the 48Ti target. The scat-
tered electrons were momentum analyzed and detected
in the left high-resolution spectrometer (HRS) in Hall A
and the coincident protons were similarly analyzed in the
right HRS. The spectrometers are equipped with two ver-
tical drift chambers (VDCs) providing tracking informa-
tion [34], two scintillator planes for timing measurements
and triggering, double-layered lead-glass calorimeter, a
gas ˇCerenkov counter used for particle identiﬁcation [35],
pre-shower and shower detectors (proton arm only) [35]
and pion rejectors (electron arm only) [35]. The HRSs
were positioned with the electron arm at central scatter-
ing angle θe = 21.5 deg and the proton arm at an angle
θp(cid:48) = −50 deg. The beam current and position, the
latter being critical for the electron-vertex reconstruc-
tion and momentum calculation, were monitored by res-
onant radio-frequency cavities (beam current monitors,
or BCMs [35]) and cavities with four antennae (beam po-
sition monitors, or BPMs [35]), respectively. The beam
size was monitored using harp scanners, which consists
of a thin wire which moves through the beam. We used
a raster of 2 × 2 mm2 area to spread the beam and avoid

3

overheating the target.

The experiment employed also an aluminum target and
a set of carbon targets, used to evaluate backgrounds and
monitor the spectrometers optics. The aluminum target
was made of two identical foils of the Al-7075 alloy with
a thickness of 0.889 ± 0.002 g/cm2. One of the aluminum
foils was positioned to match the entrance and the other
to match the exit windows of the argon gas target cell.
The two thick foils were separated by a distance of 25 cm,
corresponding to the length of the argon gas cell and the
Al foil’s thickness.

The analysis presented here uses data collected with
the settings given in Table I. All of our data were taken
in parallel kinematics, in which the momentum transfer,
q, and the momentum of the outgoing proton, p(cid:48), are
parallel. The only diﬀerence of data collection setting
for 40Ar and 48Ti is the scattered electron energy.

The VDCs’ tracking information was used to deter-
mine the momentum and to reconstruct the direction
(in-plane and out-of-plane angles) of the scattered elec-
tron and proton, and to reconstruct the interaction ver-
tex at the target. We used both the electron and proton
arm information separately to reconstruct the interaction
vertex and found them in very good agreement. The
transformation between focal plane and target quanti-
ties was computed using an optical matrix, the accuracy
of which was veriﬁed using the carbon multi-foil target
data and sieve measurements as described in previous
papers [32, 36, 37]. Possible variations of the optics and
magnetic ﬁeld in both HRSs are included in the analysis
as systematic uncertainties related to the optics.

Several diﬀerent components were used to build the
triggers: the scintillator planes on both the electron and
proton spectrometers, along with signals from the gas
ˇCerenkov (GC) detector, the pion rejector (PR), the pre-
shower and the shower detector (PS). Table II lists the
trigger conﬁgurations, including details on how the sig-
nals from the various detector components are combined
to form a trigger.

The triggers used for identifying electron and proton
coincidence events were T1 and T2, where T2 was used to
provide a data sample to calculate the overall T1 trigger
eﬃciency and we were able to compute the eﬃciency of
T1 using also the product of T3 and T4 eﬃciencies. If
the proton and electron observations from the same event
were perfectly paired, these values would be the same as
T1 trigger eﬃciency.

Electrons and protons were selected in their corre-
sponding HRS requiring only one reconstructed good
track. For the electron we required also an energy deposit
of at least 30% in the lead calorimeter (Ecal/p > 0.3) and
a signal in the ˇCerekov detector of more than 400 analog-
digital-converter (ADC) counts. Furthermore, the tracks
were required to be within ±3 mrad of the in-plane angle
and ±6 mrad of the out-of-plane angle with respect to the
center ray of the spectrometer and have a dp/p of ±0.06.
Those latter conditions focused on removing events com-
ing from the acceptance edges of the spectrometers. We

used a cut on β for the proton arm between 0.6 and 0.8 to
further isolate protons. We only included in our analysis
events in which both the electron and the proton were
recorded in a T1 trigger timing window and for which
the diﬀerence in the start time of the individual triggers
was of just few ns (time coincidence cut). For the ar-
gon target we also required that the events originated
within the central ±10 cm of the target cell to exclude
contamination from the target entry and exit windows.
By measuring events from the thick Al foils, positioned at
the same entry and exit window of the target, we deter-
mined that the target cell contributions to the measured
cross section was negligible (<0.1%). The same gas cell
was used in another set of experiments and the contribu-
tion from an empty gas cell was measured and conﬁrmed
a very low contamination of events coming from the Al
windows [33]. The spectrometer optics were calibrated
using sieve slit measurements and their positions and an-
gles were surveyed before and after moving the spectrom-
eters for each kinematic settings. The survey precision
was 0.01 rad and 0.01 mm respectively for the angle and
positions of the spectrometers.

The eﬃciencies of the elements in the detector stack
were studied by comparing rates in various combinations
of secondary triggers as in Ref. [32, 36, 37]. Table III
summarizes the eﬃciency for the trigger, acceptances and
kinematical cuts. The live-time of the electronics was
computed using the rates from scalers, which were in-
dependent of triggered events. The acceptance cuts ef-
ﬁciencies were computed using the MC simulation [38].
The eﬃciency calculations that are based on MC were
evaluated multiple times using slightly diﬀerent SF mod-
els in the MC. The eﬀect of theory models was found
to be negligible. Our MC model contains nuclear trans-
parency correction [38, 39], but does not account for all
FSI eﬀects. We have studied the role of FSI by look-

ing at kinematical distributions for various MC samples
obtained using diﬀerent ranges of the missing momen-
tum pm, deﬁned as in Eq. (3), from lower to higher. We
found that the electron arm dp/p distributions showed
slight variations. We then decided not to use the elec-
tron arm dp/p as a kinematical cut in our analysis. The
trigger eﬃciencies were computed using the other avail-
able trigger as described above. The time coincidence cut
eﬃciency was evaluated selecting a sample of more pure
signal events (using a tighter β cut) and looking at the
ratio of events with and without the time coincidence
cuts. The overall eﬃciency (between 39.6% and 48.9%
across all kinematic regions for the 40Ar target, and be-
tween 46.8% and 48.1% for the 48Ti target) includes cuts
on the coincidence triggers, calorimeters, both the lead
and the ˇCerenkov counter, track reconstruction eﬃciency,
live-time, tracking and β cut.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

A. The (e, e(cid:48)p) cross section

In electron-nucleus scattering an incident electron,
with energy Ee, is scattered from a nucleus of mass MA
at rest. Electron scattering is generally described in the
one-photon exchange approximation, according to which
the incident electron exchanges a space-like photon, of
energy ω and momentum q, with the target nucleus.

In (e, e(cid:48)p) experiments the scattered electron and a pro-
ton are detected in coincidence in the ﬁnal state, and
their momentum and energy are completely determined.
If, in addition, the kinematics is chosen such that the
residual nucleus is left in a speciﬁc bound state, the re-
action is said to be exclusive.

In the following, p(cid:48), Tp(cid:48), and M will denote the mo-
mentum, kinetic energy, and mass of the outgoing pro-

ton, while the corresponding quantities associated with
the recoiling residual nucleus will be denoted pR, TR, and
MR. The missing momentum and missing energy are ob-
tained from the measured kinematical quantities using
the deﬁnitions

and

pm = q − p(cid:48) = pR,

Em = ω − Tp(cid:48) − TR.

Exploiting energy conservation, implying

ω + MA = M + Tp(cid:48) + MR + TR,

(3)

(4)

(5)

and writing the mass of the residual nucleus in the form

MR = MA − M + Ethr + Ex = MA−1 + Ex,

(6)

where Ethr and MA−1 denote the proton emission thresh-
old and the mass of (A − 1)-nucleon system in its ground
state, respectively, Eq. (4) can be rewritten

Em = Ethr + Ex.

(7)

The usual description of the exclusive (e, e(cid:48)p) reaction
in the QE region assumes the direct knockout mecha-
nism, which naturally emerges within the impulse ap-
proximation (IA). According to this picture, the elec-
tromagnetic probe interacts through a one-body current
with the quasi-free knocked out proton, while all other
nucleons in the target act as spectators. In addition, if
FSI between the outgoing nucleon and the spectators is
negligible, PWIA can be applied, and the (e, e(cid:48)p) cross
section reduces to the factorized form

d6σ
dωdΩe(cid:48)dTp(cid:48)dΩp(cid:48)

= KσepP (−pm, Em),

(8)

(cid:113)

p(cid:48)2 + M 2. Here, σep is
where K = |p(cid:48)|Ep(cid:48), with Ep(cid:48) =
the diﬀerential cross section describing electron scatter-
ing oﬀ a bound moving proton, stripped of the ﬂux factor
and the energy conserving delta-function [40, 41], while
P (−pm, Em) is the proton spectral function of Eq. (2).
Note that Eqs. (3) and (4) imply that the arguments of
the spectral function can be identiﬁed with the initial mo-
mentum and the removal energy of the struck nucleon,
respectively. Therefore, Eq. (8) shows that within PWIA
the nuclear spectral function, describing the proton mo-
mentum and energy distribution of the target nucleus,
can be readily extracted from the measured (e, e(cid:48)p) cross
section.

When FSI are taken into account, and the outgoing
proton is described by a distorted wave function as pre-
scribed by DWIA, the initial momentum of the struck
nucleon is not trivially related to the measured missing
momentum, and the cross section can no longer be writ-
ten as in Eq. (8). However, the occurrence of y-scaling
in inclusive electron-nucleus scattering [42, 43]—whose

5

observation in the analysis of the Ar(e, e(cid:48)) and Ti(e, e(cid:48))
data is discussed in Refs. [36, 37]—indicates that the for-
malism based on factorization is still largely applicable
in the presence of FSI.

In principle, within the approach of Refs. [44–46], the
bound and scattering states are both derived from an
energy dependent non-Hermitian optical-model Hamil-
tonian. While being fully consistent, however, this treat-
ment involves severe diﬃculties. In practice, the bound-
state proton wave functions are generally obtained from
phenomenological approaches—although a few studies
based on realistic microscopic models of the nuclear
Hamiltonian have been carried out for light and medium-
heavy nuclei
[47, 48]—while the scattering states are
eigenfunctions of phenomenological optical potentials,
the parameters of which are determined through a ﬁt
to elastic proton-nucleus scattering data.

The PWIA description provides a clear understand-
ing of the mechanism driving the (e, e(cid:48)p) reaction, and
the ensuing factorized expression of the coincidence cross
section, Eq. (8), is essential to obtain from the data an
intrinsic property of the target, such as the spectral func-
tion, independent of kinematics. As pointed out above,
however, the occurrence of FSI leads to a violation of
factorization, and makes the extraction of the spectral
function from the measured cross section more compli-
cated [45, 49]. Additional factorization-breaking correc-
tions arise from the distortion of the electron wave func-
tions, resulting from interactions with the Coulomb ﬁeld
of the target [6, 50, 51].

The general conditions to recover a factorized expres-
sion of the cross section are discussed in Refs. [5, 44, 45,
If these requirements are fulﬁlled, the DWIA
52, 53].
cross section can be written in terms of a distorted spec-
tral function according to

d6σ
dωdΩe(cid:48)dTp(cid:48)dΩp(cid:48)

= KσepP D(p(cid:48), −pm, Em).

(9)

Note, however that, unlike the spectral function appear-
ing in Eq. (8), the distorted spectral function is not an
intrinsic property of the target, because it depends ex-
plicitly on the momentum of the outgoing nucleon, which
in turn depends on the momentum transfer. The most
prominent eﬀects of the inclusion of FSI within the frame-
work of DWIA are a shift and a suppression of the miss-
ing momentum distributions, produced by the real and
imaginary part of the optical potential, respectively.

B. Data analysis details

The measured cross sections are usually analyzed in
terms of missing-energy and missing-momentum distri-
butions. For a value of Em corresponding to a peak in
the experimental missing-energy distribution, the data
are usually presented in terms of the reduced cross sec-
tion as a function of pm = |pm|. The reduced cross sec-
tion, obtained from the measured cross section dividing

out the kinematic factor K and the electron-proton cross
section σep can be identiﬁed with the spectral function in
PWIA and with the distorted spectral function in the fac-
torized DWIA of Eq. (9). The oﬀ-shell extrapolation of
de Forest [40, 41] is generally used to describe the bound
nucleon cross section.

The experimental reduced cross sections can be com-
pared with the corresponding reduced cross section cal-
culated using diﬀerent theoretical models. The compar-
ison of the results obtained from the un-factorized and
factorized approaches allows one to make an estimate of
the accuracy of the factorization scheme, as well as the
sensitivity to the diﬀerent factorization-breaking contri-
butions.

The six-fold diﬀerential cross section as a function of
pm and Em was extracted from the data using the (e, e(cid:48)p)
event yield Y for each pm and Em bin

where B is the total accumulated beam charge, lt is the
live-time of the detector (fraction of time that the de-
tector was able to collect and write data to disk), ρ is
the target density (for argon, corrected for the nominal
density of gas in the target cell), BH is the local den-
sity change due to the beam heating the gas cell times
the gas expansion due to boiling eﬀects (this correction
is not included in the case of 48Ti), VB is the eﬀect of the
acceptance and kinematical cuts, and Crad is the eﬀect
of the radiative corrections and bin center migration.

We used the SIMC spectrometer package [54] to simu-
late (e, e(cid:48)p) events corresponding to our particular kine-
matic settings, including geometric details of the target
cell, radiation correction, and Coulomb eﬀects. SIMC
also provided the VB and Crad corrections as in Eq. (10).
To simulate the distribution of missing energies and mo-
menta of nucleons bound in the argon and titanium nu-
clei, SIMC was run with a test SF described in detail in
the following subsection.

In Table IV we summarize the energies of the shell
model states comprising the ground states of 40Ar and
48Ti. In our analysis, in case two orbitals overlap in Em,
we set the energy range for the orbital to be the same,
and we assumed the probability of emission of an electron
to be the same. Table IV also lists energies derived from
previous data sets, as well as the energy used in the cal-
culation of FSI eﬀects according to the model described
in Sec. IV A.

SIMC generates events for a broad phase-space, and
propagates the events through a detailed model of the
electron and proton spectrometers to account for accep-
tances and resolution eﬀects. Each event is weighted by
the σcc1 cross section of de Forest [41] and the SF. The
ﬁnal weighted events do not contain any background. As
pointed out above, SIMC does not include FSI correc-
tions other than for the nuclear transparency.

tors is then integrated over Em to get the cross section
as function of pm. We collected 29.6 (12.5) hours of data
on Ar (Ti), corresponding to ≈44k (13k) events.

We estimated the background due to accidentals to be
2% (3%) for Ar (Ti), performing analysis for each bin of
Em and pm. First, we selected events in T1 trigger in
anti-coincidence between the electron and proton arms.
This region corresponds to 100 times the nominal coin-
cidence time window width (≈2 ns). Then, we re-scaled
the total number of events found to the width of the co-
incidence peak to obtain a correct estimate of the back-
ground events. The background-event distributions were
then generated and subtracted bin by bin from the Em
and pm distributions.

C. Test spectral functions

The spectral function employed to simulate events in
SIMC is based on the simplest implementation of the
nuclear shell model,

P (pm, Em) =

(cid:88)

α

|φα(pm)|2fα(Em − Eα) ,

(11)

where the sum runs over all occupied states. In the above
equation, φα(pm) is the momentum-space wave function
of the state α, normalized to unity, and fα(Em −Eα) rep-
resents the distribution of missing energy peaked at the
value Eα, reﬂecting the width of the corresponding state.
As a consequence of deviations from this mean-ﬁeld pic-
ture originating from nucleon-nucleon correlations, we
expect the Monte Carlo simulations typically to over-
estimate the data, due to the partial depletion of the
shell-model states and to the correlated contribution to
the nuclear spectral function.

The heavily fragmented 1d5/2 shell [61, 62]—with over
10, densely packed, spectroscopic lines contributing—can
be expected to lend itself well to the approximation by a
single distribution of ﬁnite width. To determine its peak
position, in addition to the experimental data [61, 62], we
use the theoretical analyses of Refs. [63, 64] as guidance.
More deeper-lying shells—1p1/2, 1p3/2, and 1s1/2—
were not probed by the past experiments [61, 62]. Their
Eα values, as well as the widths σα for all shells, are
determined to provide a reasonable description of the
missing-energy distributions obtained in this experiment.
The resulting parametrization is detailed in Table IV,
and presented in Fig. 2.

IV. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS

The total systematic uncertainty in this analysis was
estimated by summing in quadrature the contributions
listed in Table V. We determined the kinematic and ac-
ceptance cuts ensuring that there are no dependencies
on kinematic variables and input theory model, in this
way all uncertainties are uncorrelated bin to bin. All the
kinematic and acceptance cuts were varied by the res-

and titanium assumed in this analysis.

We compared the momentum distribution, deﬁned as

(12)

obtained using the wave functions of Refs. [55, 56] and
Ref. [57], and found that the diﬀerences between them
are negligible for both argon and titanium. As shown in
Fig. 1, the momentum distributions for argon and tita-
nium also turn out not to diﬀer signiﬁcantly. This ﬁnd-
ing suggests that nuclear eﬀects in argon and titanium
are similar.

We obtain the missing energies of the least-bound va-
lence orbital for protons—corresponding to the residual
nucleus being left in the ground state, with an additional
electron and the knocked-out proton at rest—from the
mass diﬀerence of the residual system and the target nu-
cleus [58]. These values of missing energy, corresponding
to the 1d3/2 (1f7/2) state for 40

given by

22Ti could be obtained from the excitation spectra
of 39

of shell-model states induced by long-range correlations
makes this information diﬃcult to interpret within the
independent-particle model, assumed in Eq. (11), be-
cause a few spectroscopic lines typically correspond to
a given spin-parity state. To overcome this issue and
identify the dominant lines, we rely on the spectroscopic

olution of the variable under consideration. Except for
the transparency corrections, the MC used to evaluate
those uncertainties did not contain eﬀects due to FSI,
such as a quenching of the strength of the cross section
and a modiﬁcation of the kinematic of the outgoing par-
ticles. A priori the MC simulation could depend on the
underlying theoretical model. However, we repeated the
analysis of systematic uncertainties varying its ingredi-
ents, and did not observe any substantial variations of
the obtained results. As the obtained results depend on
the Monte Carlo calculation, it is important to estimate
uncertainties resulting from its inputs. To determine the
uncertainties related to the target position, we performed
the simulation with the inputs for the beam’s and spec-
trometer’s x and y oﬀsets varied within uncertainties, and
we recomputed the optical transport matrix varying the
three quadrupole magnetic ﬁelds, one at the time. Each
of these runs was compared to the reference run, and
the corresponding diﬀerences were summed in quadra-
ture to give the total systematic uncertainty due to the
Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainties related to
the calorimeter and ˇCerenkov detectors were determined
by changing the corresponding cut by a small amount
and calculating the diﬀerence with respect to the nomi-
nal yield value. The uncertainty due to the acceptance
cuts on the angles was calculated using the same method.
We included an overall ﬁxed uncertainty for both the
beam charge and beam energy, as in the previous work
on C, Ti, Ar, and Al [32, 36, 37]. We evaluated the sys-
tematic uncertainties related to the trigger eﬃciency by
determining variations across multiple runs, as well as by
applying diﬀerent acceptance cuts. A ﬁxed uncertainty
was assigned to take care of those variations.

The time-coincidence cut eﬃciency, as other accep-

tance cuts, was evaluated by changing the cut by ±σ.

our previous work. We generated diﬀerent MC where
the radiative corrections were re-scaled by (cid:112)(Q2)/2,
Q2 being the four-momentum transfer squared, and re-
analyzed the data and looked for variations. Coulomb
corrections were included in the local eﬀective momen-
tum approximation [68]. A 10% uncertainty associated
with the Coulomb potential was included as systematic
uncertainty. Finally, we included a target thickness un-
certainty and an uncertainty due to the boiling eﬀect

tion of Em and in Fig. 4 as a function of pm, integrated
over the full range of Em, for 40Ar (panel (a)) and 48Ti

The MC simulation clearly overestimates the extracted
cross sections. As the nuclear model underlying the sim-
ulation neglects the eﬀects of FSI other than the nuclear
transparency and all correlations between nucleons, this
diﬀerence is by no means surprising. Both FSI and par-
tial depletion of the shell-model states require further
studies, base on all ﬁve datasets collected by the JLab
E12-14-012 experiment, which will be reported elsewhere.

mentum for the 1p1/2 proton knockout from argon. We com-

kinematics considered in this analysis.

A. Final state interactions

Within DWIA, FSI between the outgoing proton and
the spectator nucleons are described by a complex,
energy dependent, phenomenological optical potential
(OP). The OPs available for calculations were deter-
mined by ﬁtting a set of elastic proton-nucleus scattering
data for a range of target nuclei and beam energies. Dif-
ferent parametrizations, yielding equivalently good de-
scriptions of the data, can give diﬀerences and theoreti-
cal uncertainties when “equivalent” OPs are used in kine-
matical regions for which experimental data are not avail-
able, or when they are extended to inelastic scattering
and to calculation of the cross section of diﬀerent nuclear
reactions.

Nonrelativistic and relativistic OPs are available for
(e, e(cid:48)p) calculations within nonrelativistic and relativis-
tic DWIA frameworks. However, nonrelativistic phe-
nomenological OPs are available for energies not larger
than 200 MeV. It is generally believed that above
≈180 MeV the Schr¨odinger picture of the phenomeno-
logical OP should be replaced by a Dirac approach, and
a relativistic OP should be used.
In Ref. [69], it was
shown that in (e, e(cid:48)p) reactions the diﬀerences between
the nonrelativistic and relativistic DWIA results depend
on kinematics and increase with the outgoing proton en-
ergy, and for proton energies above 200 MeV a relativistic
calculation is necessary.

We have used the so-called “democratic”(DEM) rela-
tivistic OP [70], obtained from a global ﬁt to over 200 sets
of elastic proton-nucleus scattering data, comprised of a
broad range of targets, from helium to lead, at energies
up to 1,040 MeV.

An example of the comparison between PWIA and
DWIA results is given in Fig. 5, where the reduced cross
section as a function of pm is displayed for proton knock-

out from the 1p1/2 argon orbital. Calculations are per-
formed within the relativistic model of Ref. [69] for the
parallel kinematics of the present experiment. Positive
and negative values of pm indicate, conventionally, cases
in which |q| < |p(cid:48)| and |q| > |p(cid:48)|, respectively. The reduc-
tion and the shift produced in the reduced cross section
by FSI in the DWIA calculation can be clearly seen.

The two dashed lines drawn in the region of positive
pm of the ﬁgure indicate the value of pm corresponding to
the peaks of the DWIA and PWIA reduced cross sections.
We use the distance between the two dashed lines as a
measure of the shift produced by FSI.

The reduction of the calculated cross section produced
by FSI can be measured by the DWIA/PWIA ratio,
which is deﬁned here as the ratio of the integral over pm
of the DWIA and PWIA reduced cross sections. Both
the shift and the DWIA/PWIA ratios are computed sep-
arately for the positive and negative pm regions.

The theoretical uncertainty of the shift and the reduc-
tion produced by FSI has been evaluated investigating
the sensitivity of the DWIA and PWIA results to diﬀer-
ent choices of the theoretical ingredients of the calcula-
tion.

The uncertainty due to the choice of the OP has been
evaluated by comparing the results obtained with the
DEM and other energy-dependent and atomic-number
dependent relativistic OPs, referred to as EDAD1 and
EDAD3 [71] . The shift and the DWIA/PWIA ratio in
the positive pm region, computed for proton knock out
from various argon orbitals using the DEM, EDAD1, and
EDAD3 potentials are reported in Table VI. The results
indicate a slight dependence of FSI eﬀects on the choice
of OP.

Note that the three OPs were determined by a ﬁtting
procedure of elastic proton scattering data over a wide
range of nuclei, which, however, did not include argon.
This means that the ability of the phenomenological OPs
to describe elastic proton scattering data on argon is not
guaranteed. A test of this ability is presented in Fig. 6,
where the 40Ar(p, p(cid:48)) cross section calculated at 0.8 GeV
with the three OPs is compared to the corresponding
experimental cross section obtained using the HRS of the

FIG. 6. Diﬀerential cross section for elastic proton scattering

for the DEM, EDAD1, and EDAD3 optical potentials, which
turn out to almost completely overlap, are compared with the
experimental data [72].

Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility [72]. The results of
the three OPs largely overlap, and their agreement with
the experimental cross section, although not perfect, is
more than reasonable, in particular if we consider that it
has not been obtained from a ﬁt to the data.

In the relativistic DWIA and PWIA calculations diﬀer-
ent current conserving (cc) expressions of the one-body
nuclear current operator can be adopted. The diﬀerent
expressions are equivalent for on-shell nucleons, while dif-
ferences can arise for oﬀ-shell nucleons. For all the results
that we have presented until now, and as a basis for the
present calculations, we have adopted the cc1 prescrip-
tion [41]. We note that, historically, the cc1 cross section
has been often used to obtain the reduced cross section
from the experimental and theoretical cross section. The
impact of using a diﬀerent cross section—such as the cc2
model of Ref. [41]—in the determination of the spectral
function will be discussed in future analysis.

We have also checked that the diﬀerences obtained us-
ing diﬀerent proton form factors in the calculation of the
nuclear current are always negligible in the kinematic sit-
uation of the present experiment.

The bound proton states adopted in the calculations
are self-consistent Dirac-Hartree solutions derived within
a relativistic mean ﬁeld approach using a Lagrangian
containing σ, ω, and ρ mesons, with medium dependent
parametrizations of the meson-nucleon vertices that can
be more directly related to the underlying microscopic
description of nuclear interactions [55, 56]. Pairing ef-
fects have been included carrying out Bardeen-Cooper-
Schrieﬀer (BCS) calculations. The theoretical uncertain-
ties on the shift and the DWIA/PWIA ratio due to the
use of wave functions obtained with a diﬀerent descrip-
tion of pairing, based on the relativistic Dirac-Hartree-
Bogoliubov (DHB) model [57], turn out to be negligible.

In our analysis we assumed the missing energy distri-
bution for each of the orbitals in 40Ar and 48Ti as shown
in Fig. 2. The lower and upper energy bounds assumed
in the DWIA analysis of FSI are given for each orbital in
Table IV. The FSI correction has been applied event by
event in both the missing energy and missing momentum
distributions. We applied diﬀerent corrections for events
with |q| < |p(cid:48)| and |q| > |p(cid:48)|, according to the theoretical
predictions mentioned before. For each event, we used
the reconstructed energy and momentum of both elec-
tron and proton to determine the orbital involved in the
primary interaction. Then, we applied the FSI correc-
tion, based on the pm sign. For orbitals that overlap we
use a simple prescription to determine the most probable
orbital from which the electron was emitted, as described
in Sec. III B.

V. DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION
COMPARISON

Figures 7 and 8 show a comparison between the mea-
sured diﬀerential cross sections of 40Ar and 48Ti and
the MC predictions including full FSI corrections, plot-
ted as a function of pm for three diﬀerent ranges of
Em. The missing energy regions for 40Ar (48Ti) are:
Em < 27 MeV (Em < 30 MeV), 27 < Em < 44 MeV
(30 < Em < 54 MeV ) and 44 < Em < 70 MeV
(54 < Em < 90 MeV).

We estimated the background to be of the order 2%
for 40Ar and 3% for 48Ti. The MC systematic uncer-
tainties from FSI are estimated by varying the following
ingredients of the model:

(i) the optical potential (DEM, EDAD1, or EDAD3);

(b)

27 < Em < 44 MeV

(ii) the pairing mechanism underlying the determi-
nation of the wave functions (the default BCS
model [55, 56] or the DHB model [57]);

(iii) the parametrization of the nucleon form factors.

The total systematic uncertainty is obtained by adding
in quadrature all the variations, and including an overall
uncertainty of the theoretical model of 15%.

A prominent feature of both Figs. 7 and 8 is that the
agreement between data and MC predictions including
FSI, which turns out to be quite good in the region
of low missing energies, becomes signiﬁcantly worse at
larger Em. This behavior can be explained considering
that, according to the shell-model picture employed in
MC simulations, missing energies Em > 27 MeV corre-
spond to proton knockout from the deeply bound 1p1/2,
1p3/2, and 1s1/2 states.

As discussed in Sec. III C, the energies and widths of
these states are only estimated, and not determined from
experimental data. Underestimating the widths and the
associated overlaps of energy distributions would imply a
smaller value for the diﬀerential cross section and a shift
in the pm distribution between data and MC. We have

tested this hypothesis by varying the width of the high-
energy states in the test SF and redoing our full analysis,
and noticed an improved agreement between data and
MC.

More generally, it has to be kept in mind that a clear
identiﬁcation of single particle states in interacting many-
body systems—ultimately based on Landau theory of
normal Fermi liquids—is only possible in the vicinity
of the Fermi surface, corresponding to the lowest value
of missing energy, see, e.g., Ref. [73]. An accurate de-
scription of the data at large missing energy will re-
quire a more realistic model of the nuclear spectral func-
tion, taking into account dynamical eﬀects beyond the
mean-ﬁeld approximation, notably nucleon-nucleon cor-
relations, leading to the appearance of protons in contin-
uum states.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we report the ﬁrst results of the analysis
of (e, e(cid:48)p) data at beam energy Ee = 2.222 GeV an elec-
tron scattering angle θe = 21.5 deg, collected in JLab Hall
A by the E12-14-012 experiment using Ar and Ti targets.
The measured diﬀerential cross sections are presented as
a function of missing energy and missing momentum, and
compared to the predictions of a MC simulation in which
the eﬀects of FSI are described within DWIA.

We were able to select coincidence events between the
electron and proton spectrometers with high eﬃciency
and low systematic uncertainties. The level of back-
ground and systematic uncertainties turned out to be be-
low 4%, in line with the goals listed in the original JLab
E12-14-012 proposal [74]. Overall, the comparison be-
tween the data and results of MC simulations, carried out
over the lowest missing energy range 0 < Em < 30 MeV
and missing momentum covered by our measurements
appears satisfactory. The larger discrepancies observed
at the larger missing energies such as 30 < Em < 44 MeV
re likely to be ascribable to the limitations of the theoret-
ical model based on the mean-ﬁeld approximation, em-
ployed in MC event generation, which is long known to
be inadequate to describe the dynamics of deeply bound
nucleons [1]. Understanding these discrepancies at quan-
titative level will require the inclusion of reaction mech-
anisms beyond DWIA, such as multi-step processes and
multi-nucleon emission triggered by nucleon-nucleon cor-
relations.

The missing energy spectra obtained from our analysis
contain valuable new information on the internal struc-
ture and dynamics of the nuclear targets, encoded in the
positions and widths of the observed peaks.

The determination of these spectra particularly for
deep-lying hole excitations is, in fact, a ﬁrst step towards
the derivation of the spectral functions for medium-mass
nuclei, such as Ar and Ti, within the framework of LDA,
that represents the ultimate aim of our experiment.

sis of all data, which is currently under way, will provide
information of unparalleled value for the development of
realistic nuclear models, and will allow the extraction of
Ar and Ti spectral functions.
