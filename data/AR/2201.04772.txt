For understanding the stability of Co-free positive electrode material, LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 was syn-
thesized with diﬀerent addition amount of lithium during calcination. The valence states of tran-
sition metal in the prepared samples were determined by combining accurate stoichiometry anal-
ysis via ICP, magnetic moment measurement via SQUID, and element valence analysis via XPS
with Ar ion etching. Unexpectedly, the transition metals, Ni and Mn, at interior and surface of
LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 particles show diﬀerent electrochemical properties. This answer lingering ques-
tions of Li de-intercalation mechanism in LiN i0.5M n0.5O2.

(LiN ixM n1−xO2)
alternative posi-
are promising
tive electrode materials to the currently commercial
LiCoO2 and Ternary materials for lithium ion batteries
(LIBs) [1, 2]. LiN ixM n1−xO2 cathode materials are ex-
pected to possess as high theoretical capacity as LiCoO2
of approximately 279 mAh · g−1 [3], which is based on
assumptions that [4–7] (1). Nickel and manganese are
N i2+,M n4+ in LiN ixM n1−xO2, (2). The N i2+/N i4+
redox pairs contribute to electrochemical activity while
all lithium ions are extracted, and M n4+ ions remain as
M n4+ throughout the cycling process. However, several
issues still doubt researchers including diverse reported
speciﬁc capacities [8–12], capacity loss during the initial
cycles [12–14], and poor lithium ion diﬀusivity [15, 16]. A
lot of eﬀorts have been made to elucidate these problems
and to improve the electrochemical properties based on
the above mentioned assumptions [8–16]. For example,
the capacity loss during the initial cycles was considered
to be arising from surface reaction of cathode with elec-
trolyte, so various coating methods have been developed
to isolate the cathode from electrolyte [16]; the poor rate
capacity was consider to mainly be attributed to cation
mixing at lithium site, so a strategy has been widely
used that lattice was strained by ions doping to inhibit
nickel occupying the lithium site [17]. This theory about
N i2+ and M n4+ in LiN ixM n1−xO2 originated from the
conventional element valence analysis characterized by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)[18] and cyclic
voltammetry [19]. However, XPS could only characterize

properties originating from surface several manometers
[20], and redox potentials of N i2+/N i3+ and N i3+/N i4+
are close [19]. Hence, the deduction of N i2+ and M n4+
in LiN ixM n1−xO2 is a fantasied ediﬁce, and a lot of
doubts hangs over thousands of researchers to bring the
cobalt free layered lithium nickel manganese oxides into
practical applications. The urgent task is to conﬁrm the
chemical structure of LiN ixM n1−xO2.

Herein, valence states of transition metals in as-
prepared cobalt free layered lithium nickel manganese
oxides with nominal stoichiometry of LiN i0.5M n0.5O2
were determined by combining accurate stoichiometry
analysis via ICP, magnetic moment measurement via
SQUID, and depth-proﬁling valence via XPS. Unexpect-
edly, the transition metals, Ni and Mn, at interior and
surface of LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 particles demonstrated dif-
ferent electrochemical properties. Ni at the surface of
LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 was +2, but at interior was +3. Mn
at the surface was +4, at interior was +3. XPS for the
Mn 3s orbital with Ar ion etching LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 par-
ticles conﬁrmed that binding energy presented signiﬁcant
diﬀerence for surface and interior. In the following, we
should see such an inhomogeneous valence of transition
metal indeed existed in as-prepared cobalt free layered
lithium nickel manganese oxides, LiN i0.5M n0.5O2, and
its inﬂuence on the stability and electrochemical proper-
ties.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

The cobalt free layered lithium nickel manganese ox-
ide, LiN i0.5M n0.5O2, were prepared by sol-gel method
using lithium acetate (LiCH3COO · 2H2O, MACKLIN,
99.9%), nickel acetate (N i(CH3COO)2 · 4H2O, Shang-
hai Chemical Reagent Research Institute, 98%), and
manganese acetate (M n(CH3COO)2 · 4H2O, Shanghai

Chemical Reagent Research Institute, 90%) as source,
citric acid as complexing agent. The samples were cal-
cined at 900 ℃ for 16 h to obtain the ﬁnal products after
preparing the xerogel powders as procedures of dissolving
metal salts in deionized water, adding citric acid, heating
in water bath at 80℃ for 4 hours to obtain sol, drying
in vacuum drying oven at 120℃ for 12 h to obtain xero-
gel, and grinding to powders. Due to the volatilization
of lithium during calcination, 10%, 15%, and 20% excess
LiCH3COO·2H2O were added during the initial dissolu-
tion procedure, and the obtained products were denoted
as L10, L15, and L20.

The crystal structure of prepared LiN i0.5M n0.5O2
samples was analyzed by X-ray diﬀractometry (XRD)
using a Bruker D8 Advance apparatus equipped with
a Cu Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.5406 ˚A). XRD mea-
surements were collected in the 2θ range 10 − 80◦.
The stoichiometry of each sample was decided by in-
ductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES) using Agilent 5100. Magnetic measurements
for susceptibility were carried out with with a fully auto-
mated magnetometer (MPMS-3 from Quantum Design)
using a ultra-sensitive Superconducting Quantum Inter-
face Device (SQUID) in the temperature range of 3-300
K. Chemical state identiﬁcations were made using XPS
(Thermo Scientiﬁc K-Alpha+) with a monochromatic Al
Kα source. The XPS data were collected before and after
samples were etched by Ar ions with the depths of 20 nm
and 40 nm. The electrochemical properties of the samples
were tested at room temperature in cells with metallic
lithium as anode electrode. Cell assembly and measure-
ments were carried out following the experimental pro-
cedure previously described [21] using Land CT2991A
laboratory-cell test system (Wuhan Jinnuo Electric Co.
Ltd., China) . Voltage curves were recorded at 0.05 C
rate for initial charge-discharge cycle, and at 1C for the
following capacity retention test.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared Sam-
ples L10, L15, and L20. All patterns were indexed by a
typical α − N aF eO2 hexagonal layered structure. The
patterns for all samples did not display remarkable dif-
ference, indicating that the addition amount of excess
lithium did not change the crystalline proﬁle. How-
ever, some weak diﬀraction peaks between 20o and 25o
were observed in XRD patterns of Samples L15, and
L20. These are arising from the superlattice order of
Li-Mn ions in transition-metal layers, demonstrating the
existence of Li-rich Li2M nO3 phase. The existence of
Li2M nO3 in Samples L15 and L20 was attributed to the
massive overdose of LiCH3COO · 2H2O during synthesis
process. The accurate stoichiometry of each sample was
determined by ICP-OES.

Table I shows the stoichiometry and valence of cations
in as-prepared samples decided by ICP-OES and SQUID.

It demonstrates that the Ni/Mn mole ratio is close to the
nominal value of 1:1, however due to the occupation of ex-
cess lithium at transition metal sites, the stoichiometry of
Sample L15 and L20 deviate from the designed chemical
formula, LiN i0.5M n0.5O2. Among the as-prepared sam-
ples, L10 approximately concurred with the design, but
L15 and L20 possess excess lithium at transition metal
site and the concentrations of Mn are little higher than
that of Ni.

Because lithium possesses one 2s orbital electron, ei-
ther lithium ions located at Li sites or transition metal
sites should be valence of +1. Owing to the condition
of electroneutrality, the average valence of cations lo-
cated at transition metal sites should be +3. This in-
dicates that nickel and manganese ions located at tran-
sition metal sites in LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 should be the pair
of either N i2+/M n4+ or N i3+/M n3+. Both nickel and
manganese ions possess unpaired 3d orbital electrons re-
sulting in magnetic moment, and nickel or manganese
ions with diﬀerent valence contributes diﬀerent magnetic
moments. Hence, the valence of nickel and manganese
ions could be deduced from magnetic measurement data.
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the recip-
rocal magnetic susceptibility for Sample L10, L15, and
L20. Above 200 K, the samples start to present a para-
magnetic (PM) behavior which follows the Curie–Weiss
law,

χ =

Cp
T − θp

(1)

where Cp is the Curie constant and θp is the Weiss tem-
perature. For temperature much higher than Curie tem-
perature where samples behave like paramagnetic ma-
terials, the linear ﬁt of the temperature dependence of
the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility gives a Weiss con-
stant θp and a Curie constant Cp. The ﬁtted results are
shown in Figure 2 and Table I. The negative θp value sug-
gests that antiferromagnetic interactions are present in
obtained LiN i0.5M n0.5O2. After the Curie constant, Cp,
is determined experimentally by ﬁtting the linear χ−1(T )
curve in the paramagnetic region, one can estimate the
experimental value of eﬀective moment µef f and then

Diﬀerent

from the widely reported that M n in
is of M n4+ to form the pair of
LiN i0.5M n0.5O2
N i2+/M n4+, the combination of ICP-OES and SQUID
measurements demonstrate that the major of M n in
LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 is of M n3+. This diﬀerence is arising
from the probing depth between SQUID and XPS. Mag-
netic measurement via SQUID collect the signal originat-
ing from the entire sample, but XPS probe the surface
proﬁle of the sample. Similar with reported in litera-
ture, the XPS data collected from the natural surface of
sample L10 demonstrate M n cations is mainly consist of
M n4+ according to the XPS of Mn 3s orbital as shown in
Figure 3. Combining with Ar ion etching, depth-proﬁling
XPS analysis could be enabled. Herein, Ar ions were em-
ployed to etch the surface with 100 and 200 seconds into
the depths of 20 nm and 40 nm. As the etching depth
increases, the concentration of M n3+ grows conﬁrmed
by the increasing in the energy diﬀerence between the
multiplet states from 4.35 eV (M n4+) to 5.5 eV (M n3+)
presented in Figure 3. Thus, we could conclude that the
M n4+ distributed at the surface of layered lithium nickel

LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 with diﬀerent addition amount of
lithium was synthesized. The stoichiometry and va-
lence states of transition-metal cations in as-prepared
samples were analyzed by the combination of ICP-OES
and SQUID measurements, which demonstrate the dom-
ination of N i3+/M n3+ in as-prepared LiN i0.5M n0.5O2.

cycle would be reduced. When the addition of lithium
increase, excess Li+ ions would occupied transition
metal sites, resulting in double amount of manganese
behave M n4+ to balance the valence for an average of +3
at transition metal sites. The induced M n4+ possesses
more neighbour transition metal sites, resulting in some
N i2+ to achieve the local electric neutrality. As shown
in Table I, and N i2+ ions were identiﬁed in Sample
L15 and L20. Due to the existence of N i2+ and Li+ at
transition metal sites, the coulombic eﬃciency would be
terrible during initial charge/discharge cycling. Figure
4 shows the charge/discharge proﬁles of assembled cells
with L10, L15 and L20 cathode materials. As above
discussed, assembled cells with Sample L10 cathode
materials delivered average 130 mAh/g which is nearly
half of the theoretical value of 279 mAh/g (assuming all
lithium ions were extracted). When excess lithium were
added,
lithium-rich manganese oxides generated and
excessive capacity was charged as shown in Figure 4a
(L15 and L20). However, the excessive charged capacity
was irreversible, and the discharged capacity reverted
to the level of half theoretical value depending on the
redox of N i3+ (Figure 4).

face and M n3+ centered at the interior. This answer
lingering questions of Li de-intercalation mechanism in
LiN i0.5M n0.5O2 that half of the theoretical capacity was
arising from the N i3+/N i4+ redox, excess capacity from
existence of lithium-rich manganese oxide, and capacity
loss during the initial charge/discharge cycling owing to
the existence of N i2+.
