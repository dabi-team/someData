Introduction

We consider the problem of locating a facility on a plane where a set of strategic agents
have private preferences over the facility location. Each agent’s preference is deﬁned by its
ideal point so that the cost incurred by an agent equals the Euclidean distance between
the facility location and the ideal point. A central planner wishes to locate the facility to
minimize the social cost. Since agents may lie about their ideal points if it beneﬁts them,
the planner is constrained to choose a mechanism that is strategyproof. In this paper, we
consider the problem of ﬁnding the strategyproof mechanism that best approximates the
optimal social cost as measured by the worst-case approximation ratio (AR) and quantifying
its performance.

who studied the setting of locating a single facility on a real line under the utilitarian (sum
of individual costs) and egalitarian (maximum of individual costs) objectives. Since then,
the problem has received much attention, with extensions to alternative objective functions,
multiple facilities, obnoxious facilities, diﬀerent networks, etc. Cheng and Zhou [8] and more
recently, Chan et al. [7] provide surveys of results in the last decade in several of these
settings. In the class of deterministic strategyproof mechanisms for locating a facility, the
median mechanism has been shown to be optimal under various objectives and domains
[Procaccia and Tennenholtz [28], Feigenbaum et al. [12], Feldman and Wilf [14], Feldman
et al. [13]].

There has been some related work in extending the problem to multiple dimensions.
Meir [23] shows that in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, the approximation ratio of the
coordinate-wise median mechanism for the utilitarian objective is bounded above by √d.
Sui et al. [31] propose percentile mechanisms for locating multiple facilities in Euclidean
space which are further analysed in Sui and Boutilier [30] and Walsh [33]. Meir [23], using
techniques diﬀerent from ours, ﬁnds the AR of coordinate-wise median mechanism under
the minisum objective for the case of 3 agents. Gershkov et al. [17] shows that for some
natural priors on the ideal points (that include i.i.d. marginals), taking the coordinate-wise
median after a judicious rotation of the orthogonal axes can lead to welfare improvements
In other related work, El-Mhamdi et al. [11] ﬁnd that
under the least-squares objective.
the mechanism choosing the minisum optimal location (geometric median) is approximately
strategyproof in a large economy. Lee Brady and Chambers [21] ﬁnd that the geometric
median is Nash-implementable and in the case of three agents, it is the unique rule that sat-
isﬁes anonymity, neutrality, and Maskin-Monotonicity. Durocher and Kirkpatrick [10] and
Bespamyatnikh et al. [3] analyse approximations to geometric median due to its instability
and computational diﬃculty.

There is also a large literature in social choice theory on characterizing the set of strate-
gyproof mechanisms under diﬀerent assumptions on preference domains [Gibbard [18], Sat-
terthwaite [29], Moulin [24]]. In multiple dimensions with Euclidean preferences, the char-
acterizations typically include or are completely described by the coordinate-wise median

mechanism [Kim and Roush [19], Border and Jordan [5], Peters et al. [25], Peters et al.
[27]]. Our work augments this literature, which provides strong axiomatic foundations for
the coordinate-wise median mechanism, by demonstrating its quantitative optimality.

The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we formally deﬁne the problem and state
some characterisation results and approximation results from the literature that will be use-
ful in our analysis. In section 3, we discuss the optimality of the coordinate-wise median
mechanism. In sections 4 and 5, we discuss the problem of ﬁnding the approximation ratio
of the coordinate-wise median mechanism for the utilitarian objective and the p-norm ob-
jective. Section 6 concludes.

2.1 Characterisation results in two dimensions

First, let’s deﬁne an important class of mechanisms in this domain.

Deﬁnition 2.5. In the Euclidean metric space with X = Rm, a mechanism f is called
a generalized coordinate-wise median mechanism with k constant points if there exists a
)m so that for every proﬁle
coordinate system and points c1, c2, . . . , ck ∈
x

This class of mechanisms has strong axiomatic foundations in the literature as illustrated

in the following lemma:

Lemma 1 (Kim and Roush [19], Peters et al. [27, 25]). In the Euclidean metric space with
X = R2 and an odd number of agents n, a mechanism f : (R2)n

R2 is

• (Kim and Roush [19]) continuous, anonymous, and strategyproof if, and only if, f is

generalized coordinate-wise median mechanism with n

1 constant points.

−

• (Peters et al. [27]) Pareto optimal, anonymous, and strategyproof if, and only if, f is

a generalized coordinate-wise median mechanism with 0 constant points.

We refer to the generalized coordinate-wise median mechanism with 0 constant points
and the standard coordinate-system as the coordinate-wise median mechanism and denote
it by c(x).

One subclass of generalized coordinate-wise median mechanisms that will play an impor-
tant role in demonstrating the optimality of the coordinate-wise median mechanism is the
following:

Deﬁnition 2.6. In the Euclidean metric space with X = Rm, a mechanism f is called a
coordinate-wise quantile mechanism if it is a generalized coordinate-wise mechanism where

mechanism locates the facility by selecting, for each dimension j, some ﬁxed quantile of the
ordered projection of x in the jth dimension as the coordinate of the facility location.

bounds on AR for the utilitarian objective sc(y, x) =

geometric median leaves the geometric median unchanged. We will use this observation
repeatedly in the sequel and note here that in fact it will be the only characteristic of the ge-
ometric median that we use for much of the paper. We refer to the geometric median by g(x).

It follows from Lemma 1 that the geometric median mechanism is not strategyproof.

Remark 2. The techniques used to prove Theorem 1, together with characterization results
for the one-dimensional facility location problem (Moulin [24]), can also be used to prove
that the median mechanism is also optimal for any n odd and any p
1. This strengthens
the result in Feigenbaum et al. [12] (Lemma 4), which demonstrates there is no mechanism
that is asymptotically superior to the median mechanism.

Remark 3. Lemma 5 and Lemma 6 both hold for larger classes of social cost functions than
p-norms. For Lemma 5, it is suﬃcient that sc depends only on the distances to the facility,
and for Lemma 6, it is suﬃcient that sc is quasiconvex. It follows that Theorem 1 holds for
a much more general class of social cost functions. For instance, it holds when the planner’s
objective is to minimize a weighted sum of distances sc(y, x) =

In this section, we quantify exactly the approximation ratio for the coordinate-wise median

it follows that this quantity provides a lower bound for the approximation ratio of any
deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof mechanism under the minisum objective.

For n odd2, the geometric median g(x) is unique and OP T (x) = g(x). Hence, Theo-
rem 2 amounts to ﬁnding how well the social cost of the coordinate-wise median mechanism
approximates the social cost of the geometric median in the worst case.

The argument for obtaining the exact value of AR(CM) is rather involved. We provide
a full proof for the case that n = 3 as we ﬁnd the approach taken in its proof to be simple
enough to be digestible yet suﬃciently similar to the more nuanced approach required for
arbitrary odd n as to be illuminating. We then provide a sketch of the proof for all odd n,
relegating the formal proof for this case to the appendix.

In both the n = 3 case and the general case, the key to the proof is to reduce the search
space for the worst-case proﬁle from (R2)n to a much smaller space of proﬁles that have a
simple structure. In many cases, this involves “transforming” one proﬁle into another proﬁle
that has a higher approximation ratio and a simpler structure. One important transformation
that helps in signiﬁcantly reducing the search space involves moving a point xi directly

Remark 5. There is a more explicit characterisation of the geometric median when n = 3.
In this case, if any angle of the triangle formed by the three points is at least 120o, g(x) lies
on the vertex of that angle; otherwise, it is the unique point inside the triangle that subtends
an angle of 120o to all three pairs of vertices

Proof. Let x be a proﬁle in CP .

Without loss of generality, we may assume that all xi are weakly above the a-axis and
there are at least two xi on the a-axis, since reﬂecting a proﬁle in CP across the a-axis, the
b-axis, or the line a = b gives a proﬁle in CP with the same approximation ratio. Hence, we
can label the points such that x1 = (

If c = 0, then AR(x) = 1, and so every proﬁle has approximation ratio weakly greater

Since x1 and x2 are on the a-axis, it follows from the characterization of the geometric

median for three points given in remark 5 that
moving x3 to g(x) then (if necessary) translating all points by the same vector so that the
coordinate-wise median is at the origin yields a proﬁle in CP which has higher approximation
ratio. Hence, we may further assume that g(x) = x3.

Proof sketch. We now consider the case of n = 2m + 1 agents. We begin by deﬁning classes
of proﬁles analogous to those used in the proof for n = 3.

the sequel, we describe it now in words. This condition says that any (nonzero) movement
of any xi towards the geometric median would result in a change in the coordinate-wise

coordinate-wise median moves to the origin; then, starting from i = 1 and going to i = n,
move xi directly towards the geometric median until either it reaches the geometric median
or moving it further would move the coordinate-wise median. The resulting proﬁle is in CP
and has an approximation ratio that is weakly greater than x’s.

CP with weakly
higher approximation ratio. The approach used in the n = 3 case for this step does not
extend in a straightforward manner to the general case—the main obstruction arises from
the fact that for a proﬁle x in CP , there may be i

be on either axis. The next subsection is devoted to giving an overview of the procedure

4.3 Reduction from CP to ICP

CP . Note
that we have suppressed some details (especially when the same transformation must be
used repeatedly) in order to make the exposition as clear as possible—see the appendix for
a rigorous proof.

6 Conclusion

In this work, we demonstrate that the coordinate-wise median mechanism is the optimal
deterministic, anonymous, and strategyproof mechanism for a large, natural class of social
cost functions. We show that the utilitarian cost of the coordinate-wise median is always
within √2 √n2+1
n+1 of the utilitarian cost obtained under the optimal mechanism. For the p-
norm objectives, we ﬁnd that the worst-case approximation ratio for the coordinate-wise
median mechanism is bounded above by 2

We hope that the results and methods in this paper will encourage further research in this
fundamental domain. The question of how well a randomized mechanism might approximate
the social cost of the geometric median remains open. A potentially good candidate is the
mechanism that chooses a coordinate-wise median after a uniform rotation of the orthogonal
axes. While its analysis seems hard in general, ﬁnding its AR on the worst-case proﬁle in
Theorem 2 might give a useful lower bound. Another question is to close the gap between
the upper bound on AR of the coordinate-wise median mechanism and the lower bound on
AR of any deterministic strategyproof mechanism for the p norm objective. The analysis for
more general single-peaked preferences in multi-dimensional domains also remains open.

sc(g(x), x). For this, we just need to show that d(x′i, g(x))

d(x′i, g(x))2 = (ag(x) + a)2 + bg(x)2

Next, we show that we can combine points on each of the three half-axes while weakly

increasing the approximation ratio.

Then AR(x′)

Proof. It is immediate that c(x′) = c(x). Hence, it will be suﬃcient to show that AR for x′
with c(x) and g(x) instead of c(x′) and g(x′) is at least as big as AR(x). Indeed, sc(c(x), x′) =
sc(c(x), x)) and sc(g(x′), x′) < sc(g(x), x′) < sc(g(x), x) where the last inequality follows
from convexity of the distance function.

The same argument applies for any of the other strict half axes.
Next, we show that we can move all the points that are on the geometric median to the

axis in a way that weakly increases the approximation ratio.

Note that x(1) = x. Now since the denominator of AR(x(t)) is strictly positive for t

and since both the numerator and the denominator are linear in t, AR(x(t)) is monotonic
on [0, 1 + ǫ]. There are three possibilities.

If AR(x(t)) is strictly increasing, then AR(x(1 + ǫ)) > AR(x).
If AR(x(t)) is strictly decreasing, then AR(x(0)) > AR(x).
If AR(x(t)) is constant, consider the proﬁle z′ obtained by putting t such that

Finally, the following lemma shows that we can use convexity to make the triangle formed

by the three groups of points isosceles.

Applying Lemma 11 to all points on the negative b axis gives a proﬁle x′ with a weakly higher

So we know that there must be a worst-case proﬁle that takes this form. From Lemma
14, we can say that if the geometric median of such a proﬁle is not on the b-axis, it cannot
be a worst-case proﬁle. Thus, there must be a worst-case proﬁle z with m points on some
