ABSTRACT

Coronal waves exist ubiquitously in the solar atmosphere. They are important not only in their own
rich physics but also essential candidates of triggering magnetic eruptions in the remote. However,
the later mechanism has never been directly conﬁrmed. By revisiting the successive eruptions on
2012 March 7, fast-mode shocks are identiﬁed to account for the X5.4 ﬂare-related EUV wave with a
velocity of 550 km s−1, and appeared faster than 2060
270 km s−1 at the front of the corresponding
coronal mass ejection in the slow-rising phase. They not only propagated much faster than the local
Alf´ven speed of about 260 km s−1, but also simultaneously accompanied by type II radio burst, i.e., a
typical feature of shock wave. The observations show that the shock wave disturbs the coronal loops C1
connecting active regions (ARs) 11429 and 11430, which is neighboring a null point region. Following a
40-min-oscillation, an external magnetic reconnection (EMR) occurred in the null point region. About
10 min later, a large-scale magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) overlaid by the C1 became unstable and erupted
quickly. It is thought that the fast-mode shock triggered EMR in the null point region and caused the
subsequent eruptions. This scenario is observed directly for the ﬁrst time, and provides new hint for
understanding the physics of solar activities and eruptions.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal waves, as a common physical phenomena, mostly mean disturbance triggered by related impulsive energy
releasing process, and exist ubiquitously in the solar corona. With largely improved observations, e.g., the global
coverage and high time cadence of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) aboard Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) (Pesnell et al. 2012), coronal wave has been continuously understood not only in the aspects of
the mechanisms of themselves, but also interests in whether such large-scale traveling disturbances can trigger remote
eruptions (e.g., Warmuth et al. 2015)).

Various waves invoked by the eruption in the solar atmosphere have been observed in diﬀerent wavelengths and fre-
quently reported. Among them, Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) wave has been studied most frequently owing to extensive
observations from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO, Domingo et al. 1995), the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO), and especially SDO/AIA with high-cadence. EUV wave is often found to have two distinct
parts: a leading wave-like front, and a slower trailing front ahead of the coronal dimming area (Thompson et al. 1998;
Liu & Ofman 2014). The leading front was interpreted as a fast-mode wave (e.g., Warmuth et al. 2001; Veronig et al.

Zhou et al.

2008; Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2009; Ma et al. 2011), and can propagate to the remote corona. In white light (WL)
images, the fast EUV wave is often co-located with the leading shock-front of the related coronal mass ejection (CME)
and is followed by the sharp density enhancements of CME structure (e.g., Vourlidas et al. 2003). In a composite of
the WL and the EUV images, it is not diﬃcult to recognize whether the EUV wave is the counterpart of a WL shock in
the EUV band (e.g., Tripathi & Raouaﬁ 2007). The impulsive cavity expansion during a coronal mass ejection (CME)
may trigger fast EUV waves, most probably due to a fast lateral expansion (Patsourakos et al. 2010; Veronig et al.
2008, 2018). A laterally propagating wavefront-like feature can be identiﬁed in STEREO/COR1 as the upper coronal
counterpart of an EUV wave (e.g. Kwon et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2019). The consistent observations of coronal wave
in EUV and WL observations help understand the physics of such propagating disturbance in diﬀerent wavelengths,
especially for the events observed from the solar limb.

On the aspect of determining modes of fast coronal waves related to ﬂare/CMEs, in addition to the direct obser-
vational characteristics of actual velocity, other interferometric imaging in the radio domain, such as metric type II
radio bursts, is a typical criterion for identifying fast-mode shocks as well. Type II radio bursts as reported for the
ﬁrst time by Payne-Scott, Yabsley, & Bolton (1947) and Wild & McCready (1950) appear as slowly drifting bands
of emission in dynamic radio spectra. They are characteristic signatures of expanding coronal shock waves traveling
outwards through the corona at speeds exceeding the local magneto-acoustic wave speed (or the local Alfv´en speed
in the force-free environment) (e.g., Uchida 1960). The relationship between EUV wave and type II burst has soon
been paid attention. Biesecker et al. (2002) checked 173 EUV waves from 1997 March through 1998 June, and found
only 23% of EUV waves are accompanied by type II bursts. A consistent association rate of 22% was obtained by
Muhr et al. (2014) via analyzing 60 strong large-scale EUV wave events that occurred during 2007 January to 2011
February observed by the STEREO twin spacecraft. Gopalswamy et al. (e.g., 2009) suggested that EUV waves may
usually coincide with the occurrence of the metric type II burst in the early phase of eruptions. On the converse,
Klassen et al. (2000) studied 21 metric type II events observed in 1997 with the Potsdam radio spectral polarimeter,
and noted that 90% of metric type II bursts are associated with the EUV wave. Type II burst can therefore help
identify the EUV wave with its correlated shock. However, only a fraction of the EUV waves (about 20-25%) are
indeed shock waves. The other fraction should be large-amplitude waves, but not shocks.

As a propagating disturbance triggered in the corona, coronal wave is usually questioned whether it may cause the
eruption in a remote region. On one hand, we often observe that a proceeding ﬂare triggers a sympathetic ﬂare in
distance (e.g., Biesecker & Thompson 2000), or apparently activate distant ﬁlaments (e.g., Dodson 1949), or cause
oscillation of a remote ﬁlament as observed in He I 10830 ˚A (Gilbert et al. 2008), and in EUV band with a transverse
mode (Hershaw et al. 2011; Gosain & Foullon 2012). On the other hand, MHD oscillations in diﬀerent modes are also
observed during ﬂaring process, e.g., global sausage mode (Nakariakov et al. 2003), or kink mode in a magnetically-
linked large loop (Foullon et al. 2005), or Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP, Nakariakov et al. 2005), and or a fast-mode
shock (Huang & Lin 2006; Asai et al. 2008). Among them, QPP is suggested as an observational evidence of the
magnetic reconnection process (Tan et al. 2007), and also appears in stellar ﬂares with similar manifestations (e.g.,
Mathioudakis et al. 2003). The close correlation of the coronal waves to ﬂares/CMEs, indicate that, in addition to
being the product of a nearby eruption, such fast propagating disturbance could also be the trigger of a remote
eruption, e.g., exciting the sympathetic solar activity.

Excitation of diﬀerent activities by the MHD wave is often investigated via numerical experiments. Zaitsev & Stepanov

(1982) suggested that the ﬂaring QPP can be modulated based upon sausage oscillations. In the work of Asai et al.
(2001), QPP is invoked by the fast wave periodically modulating the distance between the slow shocks at the magnetic
reconnection site. A current-carrying active region (AR) was suggested to be destabilized by the impact of a coronal
wave (e.g., Ofman & Thompson 2002). McLaughlin & Hood (2005) noticed that the electric current density can
greatly increase in the vicinity of a null point as triggered by the interaction of an aperiodic fast magnetoacoustic
pulse with neutral points. A 2D simulation was performed by Nakariakov et al. (2006) to further ﬁnd that fast MHD
oscillations can periodically trigger magnetic reconnection by modulating periodical current in the null point region,
and produce QPP when it transports in loops nearby. Based on the catastrophe model, Xie et al. (2019) demonstrated
that diﬀerent disturbances like a fast-mode shock can be produced by solar eruptions, and would be manifested as
distinct EUV waves. EUV waves are mostly understood physically as fast-mode large-amplitude waves or shocks
that are initially driven by the lateral impulsive expansion of a CME (e.g., Pomoell et al. 2008; Veronig et al. 2008,
2018; Patsourakos et al. 2010; Long et. al. 2017; Downs et al. 2012). One expectation to be understood is to focus
on the probable contribution of coronal wave in triggering sympathetic solar activity. According to three-dimensional

Magnetic Reconnection Invoked by Fast-Mode Shock

MHD model, several magnetic ﬂux ropes were simulated to sympathetically erupt in a multipolar conﬁguration by
T¨or¨ok et al. (2011), in which the main interacting mechanisms were attributed to magnetic reconnection and MHD
instability. It is time to explore in details all the probable reasons causing magnetic reconnections one after another.
Fast coronal waves are frequently produced during solar eruptions, which may be one of the probable candidates
leading to sympathetic activity and need to be paid attention especially from observations.

Previously, Zhou et al. (2019) studied a set of successive eruptive events on 2012 March 7, they laid emphasis on
identifying a large-scale magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) connecting ARs 11429 to 11430, and a proceeding external magnetic
reconnection (EMR) leading to the eruption of the MFR. In the present work, the same set of eruptions are re-visited
to explore how the key EMR is triggered, and what the causal physics between the ﬁrst and second sympathetic
eruptions is. A fast coronal wave invoked by the ﬁrst eruption is found as a new candidate to trigger the EMR and
the later ﬂare/CME. In §2, we brieﬂy introduce observations and present results deduced from the observations which
is followed by discussions and conclusions in §3.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS

The analysis is based on observations from SDO, STEREO, and SOHO as well as the radio data from the Hiraiso
Radio Spectrograph (HiRAS, Kondo et al. 1995) and Wind/WAVES (Bougeret et al. 1995). EUV data from SDO/AIA
provide detailed information in six wavebands with the typical cadences of 12 s and the pixel sizes of 0.6 arcsec. The
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Hoeksema et al. 2014) aboard SDO gives the strength of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld with the time cadences of 45 s and pixel size of 0.5 arcsec. The solar rotation eﬀect on all SDO data is
removed through registering to 00:00 UT on 2012 March 07. STEREO-A (STA) and STEREO-B (STB) well record
the propagating coronal wave ahead of the related CMEs from the side with trivial projection eﬀects. In addition,
coronal ﬁeld strength is estimated based on the 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld model constructed by the ﬂux rope insertion
method (van Ballegooijen 2004; Su et al. 2009, 2011).

2.1. A summarization of EMR and 3 MFRs identiﬁed during the eruptions on 2012 March 7

Time sequence of eruptions on 2012 March 7 are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the identiﬁcations of three
magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs) and the external magnetic reconnection (EMR) as discussed in Zhou et al. (2019). Here
EMR describes the magnetic reconnection process that takes place high between a magnetic arcade and the magnetic
ﬁelds outside this arcade (e.g., Chen et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2017, 2019b; Hou et al. 2020). The panels of Figure 1
are mainly extracted from Figures 1 and 2 of Zhou et al. (2019). In the EUV image in 171 ˚A of Figure 1a, three
MFRs, namely MFR 1 to 3 are marked by three black curves, and the coronal loops C1 to C5 are highlighted by the
white curves to constitute a null point region. Figure 1b to 1c are composites of running-diﬀerence images in three
wavelengths of 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, and 211 ˚A to display the EUV waves W1 and W2 manifested as red propagating fronts.
The EMR is displayed in Figure 1d to 1h (see also Figure 2 of Zhou et al. (2019)). Figure 1e shows the time-sequence
of the brightness distribution in EUV 171 ˚A along the slice AB in Figure 1d. W1 made C1 oscillate about 40 min
E4). E1 to E3 produced obvious bidirectional ﬂows with linearly ﬁtting speeds >200 km s−1.

QPP property in radio observation. The current work would lay emphasis on identifying the causal physics of EMR,
and a new role of fast-mode shock on triggering sympathetic eruption. The corresponding analysis would be presented
in the following sections.

2.2. Fast EUV Waves Related to Successive Eruptions

Three MFRs successively erupted on 2012 March 7 associated with three fast coronal waves and ﬂares/CMEs. As
identiﬁed by Zhou et al. (2019), the second MFR is a large-scale structure connecting ARs 11429 to 11430. It became
unstable and erupted after the occurrence of an EMR at the top. Observations show that this EMR region is disturbed
by a fast coronal wave produced by the eruption of the ﬁrst X5.4 ﬂare-associated MFR in AR 11429. It is believed
that such fast coronal wave could be a candidate driver of the key EMR.

Three successive fast coronal waves were well observed in EUV passbands, especially in 211 ˚A as illustrated in Figure
2. The original EUV images of Figures 2a to 2f well show coronal structures modiﬁed by eruptions. Three EUV waves
are clearly seen as enhanced EUV density region with sharp fronts in the running-diﬀerence images of Figures 2g-2i
(see yellow arches as labeled by W1, W2, and W3) with diﬀerence time of 2 minutes. When the X5.4 class ﬂare peaked

at 00:20 UT, W1 was seen to sweep upward over the coronal loops connecting ARs 11429 to 11430 (see the white solid
arrows and the label of C1), and raised C1 to a new height at the end of the X5.4 ﬂare at 00:40 UT. At about 00:52
UT, the EMR (pink arrows in Figure 2d) intermittently started with the manifestations of small-scale EUV eruptions
(see also Zhou et al. 2019). In a short time, the second large-scale MFR erupted at about 01:00 UT to produce W2 as
shown in Figure 2d. Immediately, the third MFR in the AR 11429 erupted leading to W3 with a clear appearance at
about 01:11 UT (see yellow curve in Figure 2e). Eventually, a trans-equatorial coronal dimming was created (see the

The X5.4 ﬂare/CME is associated with the eruption of the

Physical properties of coronal waves, e.g. the speeds projected on the sky plane, the temperature and density of
local corona, can be learned from the space-time map (right panels) over a narrow region AB (left panels) during the
propagation of the wave noses as shown in Figure 3. What these panels display are, from the top to the bottom, the
ﬁltergrams in the base-diﬀerence data of 211 ˚Aand 171 ˚A by subtracting the one at 00:00 UT, distributions of the
temperature and the density deduced via diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) approach as discussed in Cheng et al.
(2012). The DEM code “xrt dem iterative2.pro” in SSW package was originally designed for the Hinode X-ray Tele-
scope data (Golub. et al. 2004; Weber et al. 2004).
It was then modiﬁed to compute the DEM based on the AIA
data (see also Schmelz et al. 2010; Winebarger et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2012). The DN counts in each of the six EUV
wavelength are divided by the exposure time and spatially averaged over all pixels in the area (see Cheng et al. 2012).
The averaged count rates were used as the input of “xrt dem iterative2.pro” routine to calculate the DEM. The region

These speeds give lower estimates, since we only observe the projected kinematics: EUV waves are propagating at
a certain height above the curved solar surface (Kienreich et al. 2009; Podladchikova et al. 2019), and the measured
CME kinematics is projected against the plane-of-sky.

In order to determine the mode of the coronal waves, it is necessary to estimate the local Alfv´en speeds VA around

local Alfv´en speeds corresponding to W1 and W2 should not exceed 330 km s−1. Consequently, as their speeds are

Combining observations from STA with those from STB, we could deduce reasonable values for velocities of CME1
and CME2. The height-time distributions of CMEs in Figure 4e observed by STA (red) and STB (blue) clearly show
two phases of a CME, i.e., the initial phase followed by the impulsive one, which are linearly ﬁtted with solid lines,
respectively. In order to estimate uncertainties of CME heights, we repeatedly trace CME fronts in the sky plane at
each moment ten times to get 3σ of the measured distances as the error bars. The errors of velocities are obtained
from the Monte-Carlo simulations with the uncertainties of CME front situations. We use the maximum velocity
uncertainty in diﬀerent stages of a CME as the corresponding error bars. As a result, CME1 has an initial speed
530 km s−1 observed by STB,
of 2060
530 km s−1 in the ﬁeld of view of STA. With the similar ﬁtting method,
corresponding to 2240
±
530 km s−1 from
CME2 has an initial speed of 730
530 km s−1 from STB. Comparing with the local Alfv´en speed of a few

curves), both of them display the fundamental (“F”) and harmonic (“H”) band ).

Type-II radio bursts are usually considered as a good manifestation to identify coronal shock (e.g., Uchida 1960).
Figure 5 shows the radio dynamic spectrum in the frequency range from 20 kHz to 500 MHz obtained from Wind/Waves
and HiRAS during 00:25-03:00 UT covering two times of eruptions. Two sets of type-II radio burst signals covering
time intervals of 00:25-03:00 UT and 01:10-01:25 UT can be recognized (see white and black dashed curves). The
initial frequencies of the fundamental components are located at 55 MHz and 75 MHz for the type-II radio bursts
driven by the shocks associated with two eruptions, respectively. According to the empirical model about the coronal
density distribution of Sittler and Guhathakurta (1999), the density at the coronal base is considered as 1010 cm−3.
The initial heights of the two shocks were deduced at about 0.9 RJ and 0.8 RJ, respectively, which is consistent with
the observations from STA/STB. Since the noses of W1 and W2 propagated in the direction along the slice AB (see
the left panels of Figure 3), type-II radio bursts are suggested to relate to the eruptions along this way. Feng et al.

Zhou et al.

(2020) recently constructed the three-dimensional conﬁgurations of the wave W1 surfaces using three techniques. They
suggested a similar result that the same W1 nose increased from the speeds 600 to 800 km s−1 across the solar disk
with the manifestation of EUV disturbances to a much higher speed up to 3800 km s−1 in the extended corona.
We discussed that W1 and W2 in EUV observations from SDO may be the footprints in the lower corona of the
corresponding shocks driven by CME1 and CME2, which are the enhanced EUV emission at the wave front caused
by the downward push and compression of the plasma at the base due to the coronal shock or large amplitude wave
(e.g., Warmuth et al. 2005; Harra et al. 2011; Veronig et al. 2011). In any case, the current work shows that shock
waves were produced during the successive eruptions on 2012 March 7 whether in the lower corona or in the higher
one. Combining the analysis of observations, a reasonable physical mechanism about the shock wave is deducted to
trigger the key EMR causing a sympathetic eruption.

3. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION

Figure 6. 3D magnetic topology constructed by Flux Insertion Method on a vertical magnetogram at 00:00 UT seen from the
top (left panel) and side view (right panel). W1 disturbs the green coronal loops overlying the large-scale MFR of red color.
The null point region is located at the junction of two “X” conﬁgurations of yellow and green ﬁeld lines.

In order to well understand how the X5.4 ﬂare-related shock wave triggers magnetic reconnection, we need to check
the 3D magnetic topology of the erupting structures at 00:00 UT. The 3D magnetic topology covering a trans-equatorial
region was reproduced according to magnetic ﬁeld modeling using the ﬂux rope insertion method (van Ballegooijen
1020 Mx and poloidal ﬂux of 0 Mx
2004; Su et al. 2009, 2011). A ﬂux bundle is inserted with an initial axial ﬂux of 4
cm−1 in the best-ﬁt model. It then gradually evolved into a ﬂux rope with increasing poloidal ﬂux due to magnetic
reconnections with the surrounding ﬁelds during the magneto-frictional relaxation process as discussed in Su et al.
(2011). After 30000-iteration relaxations, the initial inserted ﬂux bundle was turned into a ﬂux rope as shown in
Figure 6. The size of the modeled high-resolution magnetic ﬁeld region is about 59◦ in longitude and 80◦ in latitude
on the solar disc up to a height of 1.25 R⊙ above the solar surface, and the spatial resolution in the low corona is
0.002 RJ. Figure 6 shows the 3D constructed conﬁguration seen from the top (left) and from the side (right), which
manifest topological features similar to those observed in EUV by SDO/AIA. Red lines are for the large-scale MFR3
connecting ARs 11429 to 11430, above which four sets of ﬁeld lines (“C1-C4”; indicated in yellow and green colors)
consist of two X-type conﬁgurations constituting the null point region.

The modeled 3D coronal magnetic conﬁgurations displayed in Figure 6 show how the shock triggers the EMR. Driven
by CME 1, the fast-mode shock associated with W1 (see also Figures 2g, 3a, and 3b) globally propagated with a strong
front toward the loop top of C1 and making it disturb between ARs 11429 and 11430 for about 40 min since 00:15
UT. At about 00:52 UT, EMR occurred in the null point region around C1, manifested by small-scale EUV eruptions
in FOV of SDO/AIA (see also Figures 1d, 1e, 2d, and 2e), and the typical QPP features (see Figures 1f through 1h)

revealed by radio observations (see Tan 2008; Zhou et al. 2019). With the occurrence of the intermittent EMR, the
force that results in the overlying magnetic ﬁeld and keeps the conﬁguration in the equilibrium is weakened, leading
to the eruption of the large-scale MFR3 (see also Figure 1a) at about 01:03 UT. Our observations here show that
W1-related fast shock was followed by the EMR, and the large MFR3 erupting as a fast halo CME. The physical
process behind this scenario could be the accumulation of the electric current in the region near the null point, which
is triggered periodically by the fast magneto-oscillation as W1 passed through the null point region. This is consistent
with the simulation results of McLaughlin & Hood (2005) and Nakariakov et al. (2006). In addition, we also suggest
that W1 might greatly increase the local turbulence in the null point region, giving rise to a large anomalous resistivity
that eventually invoked EMR.

In spirit of the works of McLaughlin & Hood (2005) and Nakariakov et al. (2006), we revisit the three successive
eruptions taking place on 2012 March 7. Propagating characteristics of the CMEs in two eruptions indicate the occur-
rence of the fast-mode shock, which are conﬁrmed by the type-II radio burst observed in the same time intervals when
they were observed. By analyzing the initial altitudes of the two shocks, and looking into the magnetic conﬁgurations
associated, a null point region was recognized, and the fast-mode shock driven the ﬁrst CME passing through the re-
gion around the null point. According to McLaughlin & Hood (2005) and Nakariakov et al. (2006), what we observed
in the present event might result from that the electric current intensity exceeds the threshold value, which leads a
spontaneous magnetic reconnection to taking place in the null point region, and alternates the topological structure
of the related magnetic conﬁguration, yielding the consequent eruption eventually. This scenario seems to suggest
that the fast-mode shock invoke an oscillation in the nearby magnetic structure including a null point, triggering the
magnetic reconnection process at the null point region, and further the sympathetic eruption in the related magnetic
conﬁguration. More observations in the future to verify this scenario are surely needed.
