Abstract 

Chemical nature of point defects, their segregation, cluster or complex formation in ZnO is an 

important  area  of investigation.  In this report, 1.2 MeV Ar ion  beam  is  used to  incorporate 

defects in granular ZnO. Evolution of defective state with irradiation fluence 1 × 1014 and 1 × 

1016 

ions/cm2  has  been  monitored  using  x-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS), 

photoluminescence  (PL)  and  Raman  spectroscopic  study.  Choice  of  such  fluence  regime 

ensures spatial overlapping of successive ion-target collision cascades so that reorganization 

of  point  defects  can  take  place  in  the  form  of  more  stable  clusters  or  in  the  direction  of 

possible  recovery.  XPS  study  shows  presence  of  oxygen  vacancies  (VO)  in  the  Ar  ion 

irradiated ZnO. Zn(LMM) Auger spectra clearly identifies transition involving metallic zinc 

in the irradiated samples. Intense PL emission from interstitial Zn (IZn) related shallow donor 

bound excitons (DBX) is visible in the 10 K spectra for all samples. Although overall PL is 

largely reduced with irradiation disorder, DBX intensity is increased for the highest fluence 

irradiated  sample.  Raman  study  indicates  damage  in  both  zinc  and  oxygen  sub-lattice  by 

energetic ion  beam.  Representative  Raman modes from  defect  complexes  involving VO,  IZn 

and  IO  are  visible  after  irradiation  with  intermediate  fluence.  Further  increase  of  fluence 

shows,  to  some  extent,  a  homogenization  of  disorder.  Huge  reduction  of  resistance  is  also 

noted for this sample. Certainly, high irradiation fluence induces a qualitative modification of 

the conventional (and highly resistive) grain boundary (GB) structure of granular ZnO. Low 

resistive path, involving IZn related shallow donors, across the GB can be presumed to explain 

resistance  reduction.  Open  volumes  (VZn  and  VO)  agglomerate  more  and  more  with 

increasing irradiation fluence  and  finally  get  transformed to  voids. Results  as  a whole  have 

been  elucidated  with  a  model  which  emphasizes  possible  evolution  of  new  defect 

microstructure  that  is  distinctively  different  from  the  GB  related  disorder.  Based  on  the 

model,  qualitative  explanations  of  commonly  observed  radiation  hardness,  colouration  and 

2 

 
ferromagnetism  in  disordered  ZnO  have  been put  forward.  A coherent  scenario  on disorder 

accumulation in ZnO has been presented, which we believe, will guide further discussion on 

this topic.

1. Introduction 

The presence of defects in any material is ubiquitous and ZnO is not an exception in 

true sense. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts have been carried out to understand 

individual point defects in ZnO with specific chemical identity and their respective key role 

on  physical  and  chemical  properties1-5.  At  the  same  time,  efforts  to  acquire  knowledge  on 

extended  defects  in  ZnO  such  as  grain  boundary,  dislocations  also  are  being  continued6-10. 

Sometimes, point defects in the bulk migrate to the defect sink of extended defects present in 

the material11. On another side, significant numbers of studies have revealed the presence of 

defect clusters or pairs in the bulk of the material 12-16. Indeed, it is very difficult to create and 

stabilize a single type of defect  in  a  compound  semiconductor because the very creation of 

the defect changes the Fermi level of the system and thereby alters the concentration of the 

other types of defects. Multiple defects, after being generated, may form cluster and/or pair to 

lower the local free energy and get stability. Most recent reports show enhanced thrust on this 

agenda to unearth real nature and energetics associated with the formation of defects in ZnO 

(ref.  12).  The  issue  becomes  more  challenging  when  impurities  are  incorporated  in  the 

system,  intentionally  17,  18  or  unintentionally  19.  Before  presenting  our  results  a  survey  of 

interesting outcomes on this agenda should be discussed here. Very recently, neutral VZnVO 

(zinc-oxygen  divacancies)  have  been  detected  in  electron  irradiated  ZnO  single  crystal  20. 

Such pairs dissociate when the crystal is annealed above 250 oC 20. In fact, it has been shown 

that  during  growth,  VZn  (zinc  vacancy)and  VO  (oxygen  vacancy)  simultaneously  appear  in 

the  system21  and  most  probably  they  would  remain  as  nearest  neighbour  divacancies.  The 

nature  of  open  volumes  due  to  VZn  or  VZnVO  defects  has  been  estimated  theoretically  by 

positron  annihilation  lifetime  (PAL)  calculation  22  which  closely  matches  with  the 

experimental  findings  8.  Chen  et  al.  also  identified17  clustering  of  several  (4-6)  VZnVO 

divacancies from the measured value of PAL in Al irradiated ZnO. Agglomeration of VZn and 

4 

 
VO defects (in general (VZn)m (VO)n type with m ≈ n) during annealing (at relatively lower 

temperature 23) or by multiple collision cascades of energetic ions may lead to nano-voids in 

the system 24, 25. From surface energy consideration, if two open volume defects with similar 

radii  coalesce  to  a  form  larger  one,  energy  is  lowered  roughly  by  20%.  Such  larger  open 

volumes are more stable and thermally recover in different stages above 300 oC (refs. 8,12). 

Most  probable  agglomerated  form  of  vacancies  in  ZnO  at  different  annealing  temperatures 

has  been  investigated  using  kinetic  Monte  Carlo  simulation12.  The  study  predicts  strong 

ability of VZnVo clusters to attract monovacancies such as VZns and VOs. On the contrary, 

strong attractive interaction between two donor defects such as VO and IZn (interstitial zinc) in 

ZnO  have  been  predicted  by  a  density  functional  theoretical  calculation  using  hybrid 

functionals13.  In  an  ion  irradiated  system  all  possible  vacancies  and  interstitial  defects  are 

incorporated.  A  possibility  may  occur  that  both  type  of  stable  defect  pairs  IZnVO  and 

VZnVO reside closely and can give rise to ~ 1.9 eV photoluminescence (PL) peak (red PL) at 

cryogenic  temperatures  26.  Similar  red  PL  emission  in  the  photon  energy  range  1.6-2.1  eV 

have been found in ion implanted ZnO single crystal  15. The authors attributed the origin of 

such PL peaks to the large (at least 3-4 VZn) and small size VZn clusters. However, presence 

of  VO  in  such  vacancy  clusters  has  not  been  ruled  out.  In  fact,  recent  theoretical  works 

envisage that broad red luminescence can be due to VZn-VO (ref. 16 & 27). In presence of H, 

Li, Al, N and other external impurities, several new type of vacancy-impurity complexes such 

as LiZn-VZn,, ILi-NO-VZn, NO-VZn, VZn-NO-H+, AlZn-VZn etc. become most probable defects 28-32. 

New and fascinating opto-electronic properties of ZnO have been theoretically predicted3,16,31 

and experimentally  explored14,19,29,32 using native  vacancy  clusters  as  well as  their  effective 

interaction with impurity atoms.  

The present  report  aims  to  provide  correct  and comprehensive  understanding on the 

evolution of defective state in granular ZnO with increasing fluence of 1.2 MeV Ar ion beam. 

5 

 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), PL (at  low temperature)  and Raman spectroscopy 

(at room temperature) have been employed to investigate the nature of defects/defect clusters 

after  the  irradiation.  It  has  been  earlier  observed  that  huge  resistance  reduction  takes  place 

along  with  the red-brown colouration due to  1.2 MeV Ar ion  irradiation33.  It  has also  been 

observed  that  resistance  reduction  takes  place  due  to  high  temperature  annealing,  however, 

only  yellowish  colouration  appears  in  ZnO  but  no  red-brown  colouration  8.  It  can  be 

understood that additional absorption in the green region (along with blue region, ~ 410 nm) 

of the spectrum is responsible for the change in colour from yellow to red-brown. The defect 

species responsible for absorption near 410 nm is still a matter of investigation. Energy level 

due  to  neutral  VOs  have  been  proposed  as  a  source  of  photon  absorption  in  this  region  34. 

Recent investigation shows that concentration of VOs (in ZnO) is an important parameter for 

the photon absorption peak energy  3. However, the increase of the concentration of  VO will 

necessarily invite IZn or VZn defects from the requirement of local free energy minimization. 

It  is  clear  that  presence  of  VOs  is  necessary  but  simply  VO or  their  clusters  may  not  be  the 

source  of  colour  in  ZnO.  The  analysis  using  SRIM  software  35  estimates  that  in  ZnO,  1.2 

MeV Ar ions induce roughly 60 times VOs compared to that of the VZns near the subsurface 

region36. This information is a guide for understanding the results of the present investigation 

with  a  focus  on  VO  rich  defect  clusters.  It  is  also  to  be  noted  here  that  energetic  Ar  ions 

deposit  energy in  the target  via electronic  excitations (electronic energy loss,  Se)  and direct 

elastic collisions (nuclear energy loss, Sn) 33. The knockout of target atoms from their lattice 

positions takes place due to  Sn only. Se induces excitation and ionization of target electrons 

and thereby causing defect re-organization to some extent. Higher Sn produces more vacancy 

interstitial  combination  and  higher  Se  promotes  more  interaction  between  the  generated 

defects so that, after equilibrium, a new defective state of the material is evolved depending 

on the particular combination of Se and Sn.

2. Experimental outline 

Commercially available ZnO powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) have been 

pelletized and then annealed in air for four hours at 500 °C. Annealed ZnO pellets have been 

irradiated with 1.2 MeV Ar ion beam with ﬂuence 0 (ZnO-U), 1×1014 (ZnO-IL) and 1×1016 

(ZnO-IH) ions/cm2 using  low energy ion  beam  facility  (LEIBF)  37,  IUAC, New Delhi. The 

name of the samples henceforth will be used, have been given in respective parenthesis.   

Electrical  characterizations  are  performed  using  Keithley  4200-SCS  parameter 

analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been carried out using PHI 5000 Versa 

Probe II (ULVAC, PHI, Inc.) spectrometry, equipped with a microfocused (100 mm, 25 W, 

15 kV) monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source of energy 1486.6 eV. The binding energy in the 

XPS  data  has  been  calibrated  considering  C1s  peak  position  at  284.6  eV.  The  Raman 

measurements were performed using a micro Raman set-up consisting of a spectrometer (Lab 

RAM HR Jovin Yvon) and a Peltier cold CCD detector. A He-Ne laser with wavelength of 

633 nm was used as an excitation light source. PL spectra in the range (10–300 K) have been 

taken using He-Cd laser source as an excitation source, operating at 325 nm with an output 

power  45  mW  and  a  TRIAX  320  monochromator  ﬁtted  with  a  cooled  Hamamatsu  R928 

photomultiplier  detector.  Glancing  angle  X-ray  diffractogram  have  been  recorded  using  a 

Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with Cu Kα (1.54 Å) excitation. 

3. Results and discussion 

 Figure  1  shows  the  core  level  XPS  spectra  of  O1s  (Fig.  1a-1c)  and  Zn2p  (Fig.  1d) 

levels for all three samples. The O1s peaks for all samples bear a shoulder at higher binding 

energy  side  as  clearly  seen  in  figure  1(a-c)  which  increases  for  irradiated  sample  with  the 

increase  of  fluence.  The  O1s  signals  shown  in  figure  1(a-c)  are  deconvoluted  into  two 

Lorentzian  peaks.  Generally,  the  peak  with  lower  binding  energy  (529.8  eV  for  ZnO-U 

7 

 
 
sample)  corresponds  to  O2-  on  wurtzite  structure  of  ZnO  and  higher  binding  energy  peak 

(531.2  eV)  is  attributed  to  O2-  in  the  oxygen  deﬁcient  regions  within  the  host  matrix.  The 

weight  of  the  component  reflects  the  relative  abundance  of  VOs  inside  ZnO  (ref.  38).  It  is 

clear from Fig. 1 that Ar irradiation produces stable VOs in the subsurface region. Looking to 

the  Zn  related  peaks,  an  overall  shift  is  visible  towards  higher  energy  for  ZnO-IL  sample 

(Fig. 1d). The energetic difference between the peaks for Zn 2p3/2 (at 1020.8 eV) and for Zn 

2p1/2  (at  1043.9  eV)  is  23.1  eV  (for  ZnO-U)  which  indicates  that  zinc  atoms  are  in  +  2 

oxidation  (Zn-O  bonding)  state.  The  same  peaks  are  at  1021.6  eV  and  1044.5  eV, 

respectively  for  ZnO-IL  sample.  The  energetic  shift  of  these  Zn2p3/2  and  Zn2p1/2  (from 

1020.8  to  1021.6  eV  and  from  1043.9  to  1044.5  eV)  peaks  indicates  that  Zn  is  in  its  more 

oxidized  state  after  irradiation.  So,  more  charge  has  been  transferred  from  the  Zn  atom 

making  the  nucleus  less  shielded  by  the  electron  cloud  which  thereby  increases  a  slight 

increase  of  Zn  2p  electron  binding  energy.  This  is  a  typical  case  where  Zn  atom  has  to  be 

displaced from its equilibrium lattice position with an oxygen interstitial (IO) in the vicinity 

making  an  IZn-IO  combination.  Theoretically,  Raman  spectroscopic  signature  of  such  defect 

pair  (IZn-IO)  should  be  found  ~  509  cm-1  (ref.  39)  which  is  also  seen  here  (Fig.  2b)40.  In  a 

similar situation, Kayaci et al. proposed41 that generation of VZn is expected which with VO 

form larger cluster. So, presence of IZns as well as some VZns is very much likely41. In fact, + 

0.4  eV  shift  for  Zn  2p3/2 binding  energy  has  been  attributed  for  enhanced  VZn  defects42  in 

granular  ZnO.  Yun  et  al.  have  assigned  the  higher  energy  shift  of  Zn2p3/2  spectra  as  a 

signature of VZns in electron irradiated ZnO (ref. 43). The scenario seems to be little complex 

as  the  presence  of  VZn  clubbed  with  another  defect  (most  probably  VO)  is  facilitating 

formation  of  IZn  species  in  the  system.  We  argue  that  presence  of  VZn-VO  (or  VZn-2VO)  is 

important to induce local lattice deformation31 and thereby shifting the nearest neighbour Zn 

atom  from  its  equilibrium  lattice  position.  This  contention  has  been  verified  by  another 

8 

 
theoretical  work  in  a  different  way12.  Experimentally  also,  Rutherford  backscattering 

(RBS/channelling)  study  reveals44  that  slightly  displaced  Zn  atoms  (0.07–0.1  Å)  in  ion 

irradiated  ZnO  can  be  the  source  of  IZn  and  thereby  reducing  resistance  ~  107  orders  in 

magnitude. No additional peak (Zn2p) shift has been observed with the increase of fluence. 

This  indicates  that  the  typical  defect  pair  (IZn-IO)  is  not  energetically  favourable  to  grow 

beyond  certain  concentration  even  if  more  disorder  is  incorporated.  More  and  more 

generation  of  IZn,  IO,  VZn  and  VO  defects  with  increasing  fluence  is  being  channelized  to 

create different type of defect configuration as we shall see later.     

To  comment  on  the  metallic  Zn  segregation,  Zn(LMM)  Auger  transition  spectra  for 

all three samples have also been recorded and shown in figure 3. Each Zn (LMM) signal is 

resolved into two peaks by fitting Lorentzian distribution. The ZnO-IH spectra clearly shows 

that  the  weight  of  the  lower  binding  energy  peak  (peak  A  in  Fig.  3)  has  been  notably 

increased  compared  to  the  ZnO-U  and  ZnO-IL  spectra.  The  peak  at  lower  energy  side 

corresponds to the metallic Zn whereas the other (peak B in Fig. 3) is the signature of Zn-O 

bond of ZnO (refs. 45-48). Altogether, core level XPS and Auger spectra  reveal monotonic 

increase  of  VO and  IZn  type  defects  with  the  increase  of  fluence,  however,  combination  of 

stable defect species may not be same in ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH samples. It will be more visible 

if  one  calculates  Auger  parameter    which  indicates  the  overall  chemical  state  of  the 

corresponding  atom46.  From  the  Zn2p3/2  and  LMM  spectra  (Figs.  1  &  3),  values  of   

parameter are 2009.815 eV (ZnO-U), 2010.070 eV (ZnO-IL) and 2009.624 eV (ZnO-IH). It 

is clear that both ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH bear IZn defects but the coordination of oxygen atoms 

around Zn are quite different.  

In the light of XPS findings, we would like to focus on the LTPL results of the present 

samples. 10 K PL spectra of near band edge (NBE) for the all the three samples have been 

9 

 
shown  in  figure  4.  The  donor  bound  exciton  (DBX)  emission  is  observed  at  3.365  eV  (for 

ZnO-U & ZnO-IH) and at 3.369 eV (for ZnO-IL). The DBX peak intensity is largely affected 

due to ion irradiation26 (as is also seen here) and annealing at elevated temperatures19, 23. So, 

the related shallow donor is intrinsic in nature and most probably originates from interstitial 

Zn  (IZn)  defects1.  The  thermal  quenching  of  the  DBX  peak  is  plotted  in  figure  5.  The 

activation  energies  (Ea)  for  quenching  are  in  the  range  8.5  –  10.1  meV  for  all  the  samples. 

Such a value of Ea nicely correlates with IZn related neutral donor defects49. Further, the red 

shifting of the DBX peak with  the increase of temperature has been fitted  (Fig. 6)  with  the 

equation given by Manoogian and Woolley50, EDBX(T) = EDBX(0) UTs 2V/(exp(/T)1), 

assuming  that  donor  energy  level  follows  the  thermal  shrinkage  of  the  band  gap5.  In  the 

above equation, EDBX(0) represents the DBX energetic position at 0 K, U and V represent the 

lattice dilatation and electron–phonon interaction term respectively. s is an exponent and is 

related  with  the  Debye  temperature4.  In  both  the  figures  5  &  6,  effects  of  700  keV  O  ion 

irradiation26  has  been  provided  for  comparison.  The  closeness  of  the  parameters  (shown  in 

Figs. 5 & 6) indicates that no new donor state has evolved due to Ar ion irradiation. The inset 

of figure 4 shows deep level emissions (DLE) at 10 K. The broad defect luminescence in the 

range 2.7-3.0 eV is a characteristic of semi-insulating ZnO (ref. 51) with high concentration 

of  compensating  acceptor  defects52.  Most  probable  nature  of  such  acceptors  are  VZn  and 

OZns26,28.  Consequently,  the  sheet  resistance  of  ZnO-IL  sample  has  increased  an  order  in 

magnitude compared to that of the ZnO-U (Fig. 7). So broad PL in the range 2.7-3.0 eV can 

be  donor  acceptor  type  transition  from  extended  IZn  states  (due  to  different  vacancy 

decoration  of  IZn  sites)  to  the  VZn  levels41,  53,  assuming  neutral  VZn  energy  level  to  be  just 

above the conduction band. The PL emission ~ 2.4 eV (figure 4, inset) can be considered as 

stable VO

+ in  the bulk2,4,33.  More abundant  VOs in  ZnO-IL sample  is  in  agreement with  the 

XPS findings.  The increase of fluence from  1014  to  1016  lowers DLE  (and also  overall PL) 

10 

 
indicates incorporation of more non-luminescent centers. It can be understood that the size of 

the  vacancy  clusters54  increases  as  collision  cascades  spatially  overlap  with  the  increase  of 

fluence. More and more open volume defects merge to lower local free energy and as a result 

effective active volume of luminescent material decreases. Interesting enough, the DBX peak 

intensity is enhanced compared to ZnO-U due to highest fluence of irradiation (Fig. 4, sample 

ZnO-IH).  The  possible  reason  has  been  discussed  afterwards  with  a  model  on  irradiation 

effects in radiation hard materials.     

Results  of  Raman  spectroscopic  measurement  of  the  samples  have  been  already 

shown in  figure  2. Two  strong non-polar Raman modes,  E2 (low) [101 cm-1] and E2 (high) 

[437 cm-1] which are characteristic of wurtzite structure of ZnO along with two weak Raman 

modes,  generally  ascribed  as  E2  (high)  -  E2  (low)  [331  cm-1]  and  A1(TO)  [380  cm-1]  have 

been observed in the spectrum of ZnO-U sample. In ZnO, E2 (low) Raman mode is related to 

Zn sub-lattice while vibration of oxygen atoms is responsible for the E2 (high) mode55. Broad 

and  asymmetric  tailing  of  E2  (low)  Raman  mode  at  higher  frequencies  is  common  in  ion 

irradiated26  or  mechanically  milled56  ZnO  systems.  Tailing  of  E2  (low)  mode  is  very  much 

pronounced in  ZnO-IH Raman spectrum. Tentative origin of such tailing has been assigned 

with enhanced Zn sub-lattice disorder due to combination effect of VZn and VO (ref. 57). In 

our view, the extent of tailing of E2 (low) is correlated with the size of open volume defects. 

Higher  disorder  induces  a  loss  of  long  range  crystalline  symmetry  and  hence  decrease  of 

intensity of E2 (high) Raman mode is clearly observed. Further, irradiation causes evolution 

of another broad Raman mode (520-600 cm-1) which is commonly attributed to VO and/or IZn 

type  defects  i.e.,  oxygen  deficient  disordered  state55,  58.  The  deconvolution  of  the  broad 

Raman mode gives three different peaks centered ~ 540, 560 and 575 cm-1 (Fig. 8). The peak 

~540 cm-1 is basically a second order Raman mode [2B1

low; 2LA] which is normally activated 

in  presence  of  defects  56.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  A1(LO)  and  E1(LO)  modes  are  very 

11 

 
closely spaced55 around 580 cm-1. Here, 575 cm-1 peak has the contribution of both A1(LO) 

and  E1(LO)  modes  among  them  E1(LO)  is  very  sensitive  to  lattice  defects,  particularly  to 

VOs55. On the other hand, ~ 560 cm-1 peak is related with the IZn defects (ref. 59). However, it 

is more convincing to assign this Raman mode with the disorder at the interface of embedded 

Zn in a ZnO matrix53. Relative enhancement of 560 cm-1 Raman mode has been observed for 

ZnO-IH  compared to  ZnO-IL sample  (Fig. 8 inset).  In this context,  it is plausible to  assign 

575 cm-1 Raman mode with the bulk VOs in the ZnO crystal. The peak shapes become blurred 

in  ZnO-IH  sample  indicating  homogenized  disorder26  to  some  extent.  Altogether,  Raman 

spectroscopic investigation indicates clustering of individual vacancies for highest fluence of 

irradiation. At the same time, increase of embedded Zn atomic sites in ZnO lattice can also be 

understood  (for  ZnO-IH).  This  is  conceivable  if  two  types  of  defective  zones  gradually  get 

separated60 as more disorder is  incorporated in  the system,  one leads to  formation  of nano-

voids (agglomerated VZn-VO s) and the other transforms to highly non-stoichiometric Zn rich 

ZnO.      

Based on the results discussed above we have proposed (schematically shown in fig. 

9)  a  model  which  can  be  understood  as  a  general  feature  of  accumulation  of  disorder  in  a 

radiation hard material. In the low fluence regime, only scattered point defects appear in the 

system  (Fig.  9a).  Both  VZn  and  VOs  stabilize  in  the  bulk  of  the  material.  VZns  are 

compensating  acceptors  in  ZnO  and  hence  “kill”  donor  electrons.  VOs  are  deep  donors  in 

ZnO  and  are  unable  to  generate  conductivity  at  room  temperature1,  16.  So  incorporation  of 

isolated  VZn  and  VO  should  increase  the  ZnO  material  resistance.  With  the  increase  of 

fluence,  collision  cascades  starts  to  overlap  and  average  separation  between  point  defects 

decrease.  Se  plays  an  key  role in  the vacancy agglomeration process,25, 61 most probably by 

promoting  diffusion  of  vacancies.  Energetically,  the  formation  of  VZnVO  divacancy 

(compared to distant VZn and VO)31 or their higher order cluster12 (such as (VZn)m (VO)n type 

12 

 
with m ≈ n, as mentioned earlier) are favourable in ZnO. In granular material, a fraction of 

such defects may migrate to the universal defect sink i e., grain boundaries (Fig. 9b). Increase 

of grain boundary depletion region width may additionally contribute to the enhancement of 

ZnO  resistance.  Further  increase  of  fluence  induces  a  characteristic  change  in  the  defective 

state of the material. Larger clusters agglomerate to generate voids which become new defect 

sink in the system. Deposited energy by ion beam in the form of Se and Sn disseminate and/or 

recover a major fraction of the defects in the GB region. Residual defects migrate towards the 

voids increasing their size further. The system is now composed of large open volume defects 

(agglomerated VZn and VOs) and channels25, 60 (Fig 9c) in between them which are Zn rich. 

Interstitial  loops  and  vacancy  zones  nearby  exist  as  seen  by  an  in-situ  high  resolution 

transmission electron microscopic study of metallic Mg during ion irradiation62. If IZn defects 

present  in  this  nano-channels  with  sufficient  number,  conductivity  should  increase  and  an 

insulator to metal transition can also be induced63. In fact, the presence of embedded metallic 

zinc  has  been  found48  in  laser  irradiated  black  ZnO.  Of  course,  the  ratio  of  Zn/O  in  the 

subsurface  region  will  depend  on  the  relative  sputtering  of  the  elements  during  ion  beam 

irradiation. In the channel region, interstitial dislocation loops as well as VZn, VOs should be 

present.  However,  overall  disorder  can  be  presumed  to  be  less  than  compared  to  situation 

when GB regions exist in the sample. That is why  XRD peak (e.g., 002) intensity is higher 

even  for  higher  fluence  (Fig.  10).  Concerning  the  PL,  voids  reduce  the  optically  active 

volume of the material, but the channels contribute to  IZn related DBX emission. Regarding 

colour of the sample, it has been conjectured that red-brown appearance is related with the Zn 

excess  in  ZnO  (ref.  2).  So  IZn  defect  dominated  channel  regions  are  the  source  of  such 

colouration33  in  the  high  fluence  irradiated  ZnO.  It  has  been  shown  earlier33  that  photon 

absorption  ~  400,  430  and  500  nm  regions  are  responsible  for  red-brown  colour  of  ZnO. 

Absorption  of  photons  ~  400  nm  can  only  generate  yellow  coloured  ZnO34.  Additional 

13 

 
absorption ~ 430 nm (2.88 eV) and 500 nm (2.48 eV) can arise due to presence of extended 

IZn  states53  and  VZnVO  defects16,27  respectively.  We  believe,  presence  of  VO,  VZnVO, 

VZnVO etc. in the disordered channel region contribute to the different absorption regions 

mentioned  above.  Consequently,  lattice  distortion  due  to  such  defects  can  stabilize31,44  IZn 

related shallow as well as semi-shallow donor states in this region.  

Altogether, few interesting consequences can be foreseen based on the scenario presented 

here.  

i)  Amorphization  is  hardly  achievable  if  a  material  can  efficiently  generate  voids  in 

application of energetic ion irradiation. Generation of voids depends on the diffusion 

coefficient of the concerned open volume defects (material property) and also on the 

sample  temperature60.  On  the  other  hand,  presence  of  foreign  atom  (chemical 

impurity, like As in GaSb alloy) can hinder void formation during ion irradiation and 

amorphization  can  be  reached61.  Till  date,  limited  report  exists  in  ZnO  such  as  Si 

implantation induced secondary phase formation and amorphization 64. 

ii)  After  reaching  this  new  defective  state,  the  overall  defect  as  probed  by  RBS65  or 

positron annihilation spectroscopy15 will show a saturation of defects with increasing 

irradiation fluence further. This is because voids now act as both sink11 and source of 

vacancies and the two distinctly different regions, as depicted in fig. 9c, are in defect 

equilibrium.  In fact,  a  recent  work envisages that buried extended defects  can make 

ZnO more resistant for incorporating more disoder66. 

iii) Due to dominant IZn species (donor defects) in the nano channels, it is impossible to 

achieve  p-type  conductivity  in  high  fluence  (≥  1016  ions/cm2)  irradiated  ZnO.  High 

concentration  of  implanted  dopants  like  N  (or  Li)  may  form  N2  in  voids  (or  form 

14 

 
metal  clusters)  without  being  substituted  at  VZn  sites  and  generating  NZn  (LiZn) 

acceptors.   

iv)  Ferromagnetism  is  expected  in  such  highly  disordered  nano-network7.  Indeed,  room 

temperature ferromagnetic state has been detected in ZnO after high fluence of O (ref. 

14) irradiation. This phenomenon is not limited to ZnO but has been found in highly 

disordered  SnO2  and  TiO2  (ref.  67)  and  other  wide  band  gap  semiconductors. 

However, here, the ferromagnetic state will not be Dietl like68 (sufficiently high hole 

doped  wide  band  gap  ferromagnetic  semiconductor),  rather  due  to  donor  impurity 

band as proposed by Coey et al.  69 and observed by Zhang et al.70, Maekawa et al.14 

and several other groups. 

v)   The change in the dominant ~ 3.315 eV transition in Fig. 4 (commonly termed as free 

to  bound,  FB  transition9,  26)  has  not  been  discussed  here.  FB  transition  generally 

originates  from  localized  acceptor  defects  in  the  vicinity  of  the  GB23.  If  the  new 

defective  state  (after  high  fluence  of  irradiation)  evolves  at  the  expense  of  grain 

boundary disorder, it is natural that FB peak intensity will be diminished compared to 

that of the DBX (IZn related) as is noticed in Fig. 4.     

vi)  The  modification  of  the  disordered  network  due  to  annealing  at  relatively  lower 

temperatures  would  be  encouraging.  Presumably,  the  system  will  not  go  back  to  its 

original  granular  nature  and  should  show  interesting  physical  properties,  yet  to  be 

investigated in detail. 

vii) The  scenario  in  single  crystalline  ZnO  will  be  different  as  such  system  has  less  in-

built disorder (particularly GB regions) compared to that of granular materials. At this 

stage, it is not known how much fluence is required for the evolution (if at all) of two 

types of defective zones as sketched in fig 9c. Only it has been observed (not shown 

here)  that  for  a  fluence  of  3×1014  ions/cm2  on  ZnO  single  crystal  (hydrothermally 

15 

 
grown,  MTI  Corp.,  USA)  sample  lost  its  NBE  drastically  (similar  to  O  irradiation 

effect57) even at 10 K. A recent report, however, shows a saturation71 in defects above 

1016 ions/cm2 irradiation fluence of 300 keV Ar in ZnO single crystal target.      

4. Conclusion     

In this report, XPS, PL and Raman spectroscopic investigations have been combined 

in a general framework for understanding irradiation effects in granular ZnO. In low fluence 

regime  when  individual  collision  cascades  do  not  spatially  overlap,  only  scattered  point 

defects  are  incorporated  in  the  system.  Adding  disorder  with  higher  fluence  facilitates 

agglomeration  of  vacancies  to  larger  clusters  containing  both  VZn  and  VOs.  Increase  of 

vacancy  cluster  size  further  leads  to  appearance  of  voids  in  the  system  and  the  remaining 

regions  becomes  Zn  rich.  This  is  indeed  a  new  defective  state  of  the  material  as  the  voids 

have  become  major  defect  sinks  not  the  grain  boundary  regions.  Possible  consequences  of 

high fluence irradiation on the ZnO properties, particularly on colouration and conductivity, 

have been briefly outlined in the light of this model. Non-monotonic changes in the resistive 

nature  of  granular  ZnO,  often  observed  with  increasing  irradiation  fluence,  can  also  be 

addressed  taking  into  account  the  evolution  of  changing  defective  nature  of  the  system.  To 

our  knowledge,  this  work  provides  most  general  overview  as  of  now  for  explaining  and 

understanding ion induced disorder in ZnO.

Figure  1.  (a-c)  O1s  and  (d)  Zn2p  peaks  of  XPS  spectra  of  ZnO-U,  ZnO-IL  and  ZnO-IH 

samples. Coloured circles represent corresponding colour of the samples. 

Figure 2. (a) Raman spectra of ZnO-U, ZnO-IL  and ZnO-IH samples. ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH 

spectra  have  been  vertically  shifted  for  better  view.  (b)  Magnified  view  of  500-610  cm-1 

Raman spectra region showing a new signal at ~509 cm-1 (identified with arrow) in ZnO-IL 

spectra and broad Raman modes at 520-600 cm-1 in both ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH spectra. 

Figure 3. Zn (LMM) Auger electron spectra of ZnO-U, ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH samples. Peak A 

energetic position for ZnO-U is at 495.125 eV and the same for peak B is at 497.625 eV. 

Figure  4.  Near  band  edge  photoluminescence  spectra  of  ZnO-U,  ZnO-IL  and  ZnO-IH 

samples at  10 K. Corresponding deep level  emissions (DLE) have been shown in  the inset. 

PL emission ~ 3.315 eV has been assigned as FB (free to bound) transition.  

Figure 5. Thermal quenching of PL intensities of main DBX emission (3.365 eV) for ZnO-U, 

ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH samples. Similar thermal quenching behaviour of oxygen ion irradiated 

(700 keV O; 3×1014 ions/cm2) ZnO has been shown for comparison. The solid lines are fit to 

the equation I(T) = I(0)/[1 + Aexp(-Ea/kBT)], where I(T) is the PL intensity at temperature T, 

A is a constant and Ea is the activation energy of quenching.  Respective Ea values have been 

shown inside the bracket. 

Figure  6.  DBX  emission  peak  shift  with  temperature  for  ZnO-U,  ZnO-IL  and  ZnO-IH 

samples. Similar plot corresponding to oxygen ion irradiated (700 keV O; 3×1014 ions/cm2) 

ZnO has been shown for comparison. Such form of variations is fitted with the formula given 

by Manoogian and Woolley50 for band gap shrinkage with increasing temperature.

Figure  7.  Variation  of  sheet  resistance  with  increasing  fluence  for  1.2  MeV  Ar  irradiated 

ZnO. Inset shows I-V characteristics of the ZnO-U, ZnO-IL and ZnO-IH samples. 

Figure  8.  Deconvolution  of  broad  Raman  modes  (520-600  cm-1)  in  ZnO-IL  and  ZnO-IH 

spectra.  Best  fitting  using  three  Lorentzian  have  been  shown.  The  inset  shows  the  relative 

change  of  Raman  mode  ~  560  cm-1  with  respect  to  irradiation  fluence  (both  axes  in 

logarithmic scale). Here unirradiated sample has been assigned with 1010 ions/cm2 irradiation 

fluence. The solid line is a guide to eye.  

Figure  9.  Model  representing  the  effect  of  ion  beam  irradiation  in  granular  ZnO  material. 

Shape, scale and colours are qualitative and for illustration only. (a) Case of low irradiation 

fluence  where  only  scattered  point  defects  (white  points)  appear.  For  1.2  MeV  Ar  ion  on 

ZnO,  low  fluence  represents  ≤  1012  ions/cm2  (below  which  chance  to  overlap  of  collision 

cascades is less likely) which is very difficult to realize. (b) Moderate fluence regime where 

collision  cascades  frequently  overlap  and  initiate  agglomeration  of  point  defects  to  form 

larger defect clusters. (c) High irradiation fluence (certainly ≥ 1016 ions/cm2 for 1.2 MeV Ar 

ion  on  ZnO)  induced  void  formation  and  probable  modification  of  GB  regions  is 

schematically addressed (details in the text).
