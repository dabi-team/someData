ABSTRACT

The second Hi-C ﬂight (Hi-C2.1) provided unprecedentedly-high spatial and temporal resolution
(∼250km, 4.4s) coronal EUV images of Fe IX/X emission at 172 ˚A, of AR 12712 on 29-May-2018, during
18:56:21-19:01:56 UT. Three morphologically-diﬀerent types (I: dot-like, II: loop-like, III: surge/jet-
like) of ﬁne-scale sudden-brightening events (tiny microﬂares) are seen within and at the ends of an arch
ﬁlament system in the core of the AR. Although type Is (not reported before) resemble IRIS-bombs
(in size, and brightness wrt surroundings), our dot-like events are apparently much hotter, and shorter
in span (70s). We complement the 5-minute-duration Hi-C2.1 data with SDO/HMI magnetograms,
SDO/AIA EUV images, and IRIS UV spectra and slit-jaw images to examine, at the sites of these
events, brightenings and ﬂows in the transition-region and corona and evolution of magnetic ﬂux in
the photosphere. Most, if not all, of the events are seated at sites of opposite-polarity magnetic ﬂux
convergence (sometimes driven by adjacent ﬂux emergence), implying likely ﬂux cancellation at the
microﬂare’s polarity inversion line. In the IRIS spectra and images, we ﬁnd conﬁrming evidence of
ﬁeld-aligned outﬂow from brightenings at the ends of loops of the arch ﬁlament system. In types I and
II the explosion is conﬁned, while in type III the explosion is ejective and drives jet-like outﬂow. The
light-curves from Hi-C, AIA and IRIS peak nearly simultaneously for many of these events and none
of the events display a systematic cooling sequence as seen in typical coronal ﬂares, suggesting that
these tiny brightening-events have chromospheric/transition-region origin.

The second sounding-rocket ﬂight of

the High-
Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C 2.1: Rachmeler et al.
2019) took coronal extreme ultra-violet (EUV) images
of NOAA active region (AR) 12712 in 172 ˚A (Fe IX/X
emission) with unprecedented spatial and temporal res-
olutions (∼250 km, 4.4 s). The data was collected

Tiwari et al.

for about ﬁve minutes, during the period of 18:56:21
– 19:01:56 UT on May 29, 2018, near solar disk center
(AR position: N15E10). The Hi-C 2.1 (hereafter ‘Hi-C’)
data have revealed multiple small-scale activities inside
the AR core and in the AR’s surroundings. These small-
scale brightenings remained unnoticed in earlier EUV
observations.

Solar ARs contain the brightest and hottest coronal
EUV loops (Golub et al. 1980; Reale 2014) – the core of
an AR is typically the brightest structure inside the AR
(Warren et al. 2012). In the chromosphere the AR core
often contains a set of cool loops, known as an arch ﬁl-
ament system (Bruzek 1967), long observed in H-alpha
ﬁltergrams. Usually emerging ﬂux regions (EFRs: Zirin
1972) in the cores of ARs are seen as cool arch ﬁlament
systems (Bruzek 1967; Frazier 1972). Because the ﬁeld
is arched and emerging, these arch ﬁlament systems are
found to have blueshifts (of up to 10 km s−1) in their
central parts (apex) in the chromosphere and redshifts
(of up to 40 km s−1) at both ends (Georgakilas et al.
1990; Tsiropoula et al. 1992; Gonz´alez Manrique et al.
2018). These ﬂow patterns weaken as the ﬁeld emer-
gence ends – hardly any signiﬁcant ﬂows are noticed af-
ter the emergence has stopped. The AR in the present
study is near the end of global emergence of its overall
bipolar ﬁeld (but local ﬂux emergence at multiple places,
often recurrently, continues).

Small-scale polarity inversion lines (PILs), also known
as neutral lines, are often present in the cores of EFRs
(Frazier 1972). These emerging ﬂux regions (with cool
chromospheric but hot coronal environment) can have
multiple explosive events such as Ellerman bombs (EBs:
Ellerman 1917; Rutten et al. 2013), surges (Newton
1942; Roy 1973) and IRIS bombs (IBs: Peter et al.
2014).
IBs and EBs both have mixed-polarity photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld, and often have common prop-
erties to each other but their plasma temperatures (of
<10,000 K for EBs vs (cid:39)80,000 K for IBs) are appar-
ently diﬀerent. Both EBs and IBs might form in the
photosphere (Tian et al. 2016). Recent magnetohydro-
dynamic simulations however support the idea that both
form in the higher atmosphere, i.e., in the low chromo-
sphere (Hansteen et al. 2019).

Surges are more explosive (than EBs), can be hot-
ter than chromospheric temperature, and have a rapid
cool plasma outﬂow (from the source region), often fol-
lowed by a weaker inﬂow (plasma ﬂowing towards the
source/base of the surge) (Newton 1942). EBs are some-
times present at the base of surges (Roy 1973; Mat-
sumoto et al. 2008; Young et al. 2018), which have
mixed-polarity photospheric magnetic ﬂux similar to
EBs, and are a consequence of ﬂux emergence and/or

ﬂux cancellation (Roy 1973; Liu & Kurokawa 2004; Jiang
et al. 2007; L´opez Fuentes et al. 2018).

In the present work we report on three types of ﬁne-
scale transient brightening events in the core of the
AR 12712 observed in 172 ˚A by Hi-C: type I, dot-like;
type II, loop-like; and type III, surge/jet-like events (de-
scribed in Section 3). Type I events were not identiﬁed
earlier in AIA 171 ˚A probably due to their small size,
but possibly partially due to AIA’s somewhat narrower
bandwidth than that for Hi-C.

2. DATA AND METHODS

The ﬁve minutes of Hi-C observations (obtained at a
cadence of 4.4 s and a spatial resolution of ∼250 km:
Rachmeler et al. 2019) were complemented by the In-
terface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS: De Pontieu
et al. 2014a), the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT: Tsuneta
et al. 2008; Ichimoto et al. 2008; Suematsu et al. 2008;
Shimizu et al. 2008; Lites et al. 2013) onboard Hinode
(Kosugi et al. 2007), the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager
(HMI: Schou et al. 2012) and Atmospheric Imaging As-
sembly (AIA: Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO, and
several other instruments. We mainly analyze the data
from Hi-C, IRIS and SDO (AIA+HMI) in the present
work.

IRIS captured slit-jaw (SJ) movies in Mg II 2796, Mg
continuum 2832, Si IV 1400 and C II 1330 ˚A at a cadence
of 13 s with a pixel size of 0.33 arcsec. These SJ images
sample plasma from 6000 K to ∼100,000 K.

The IRIS slit scanned an east part of the region of
our interest with an 8-step raster, at a step size of 1
arcsec and a step cadence of 3.2 s, thus resulting into a
raster cadence of 25 s (OBS ID 3600104031). A total of
256 rasters were obtained for about 1 h and 50 minutes,
including the ﬁve minutes of Hi-C observations. The
exposure time for each slit position of each wavelength
is 2 s. The slit width is 0.33 arcsec, and each pixel of
the spectrum image spans 0.33 arcsec along the slit and
a wavelength increment of 0.02 ˚A (or a Doppler shift
increment of 3 km s−1) along the dispersion axis. The
Hi-C ﬁeld of view (FOV) and the FOV of our interest
are shown in Figure 1.

Similar to that of IRIS, the SDO AIA (12 s cadence
for EUV images and 24 s cadence for UV images, 0.6
arcsec pixel size) and HMI (45 s cadence for line of sight
(LOS) magnetograms, a pixel size of 0.5 arcsec) data are
used to follow the brightness and magnetic ﬁeld in the
cool arch ﬁlament system. The random per-pixel photon
noise for 45 s cadence HMI LOS magnetograms is ≈7 G
(Couvidat et al. 2016). Small-scale dynamic events are
followed for two and a half hours, centered at the Hi-C
observations.

Tiwari et al.

AIA covers a broad range of temperatures. We use
all EUV channels: AIA 304, 171, 193, 211, 335, 94, and
131 ˚A, which show emission from plasma at ∼50,000 K
(He II), 700,000 (Fe IX/X), 1.5 MK (Fe XII), 2 MK
(Fe XIV), 2.5 MK (Fe XVI), 6 MK (Fe XVIII), and
10 MK (Fe XXI), respectively. Note that AIA 94 and
131 channels also see cooler components at about 1
MK and 0.5 MK, respectively, and the AIA 193 channel
sees a hotter component at 20 MK. The AIA 193 and
211 ˚A channels also see some cooler plasma, see Lemen
et al. (2012) for details. Warren et al. (2012) describe a
method to remove the warm component from the AIA
94 channel. We have used this method to calculate “hot
94” images.

The Hi-C, IRIS, and SDO data are well aligned us-
ing SSW routines. Note that all corrections, including
roll angle, as well as by manual ﬁne tuning whenever
required, were performed for alignment of Hi-C, IRIS,
AIA images, and HMI magnetograms to about the spa-
tial resolution of these images. HMI LOS magnetograms
at a 45 s cadence are used to follow ﬂux cancellation,
emergence and/or the presence of mixed-polarity mag-
netic ﬁeld.

We have created three videos from Hi-C, IRIS SJ, and
AIA images to track features over time and compare
them in multiple wavelengths. To allow better tracking
we have over plotted HMI LOS magnetogram contours
of ±25 G on each frame in these movies.

We have created movies of the Dopplergrams from the
spectral data of Mg II 2796, Si IV 1400 and C II 1330
˚A lines obtained with IRIS. Dopplergrams are intensity
diﬀerences at ﬁxed wavelength oﬀsets (ﬁxed Doppler-
shift oﬀsets) from line center in the blue and red wings
of the line. For best visibility of redshift and blueshift
our selected oﬀsets are ±50 km s−1 for Mg II 2796 ˚A (as
in De Pontieu et al. 2014b; Tiwari et al. 2018), and ±25
km s−1 for C II 1330 and Si IV 1400 ˚A lines (based on
diﬀerent trials in this work). These Dopplergrams show
signatures of blueshift and/or redshift along the slit at
the location where the slit cuts across the surge or other
brightening event. To suppress local ﬂuctuations in the
Dopplergrams, we have averaged Dopplergrams created
by integrating the signal over a range of 10 km s−1 cen-
tered at around ±50 km s−1 for Mg II, and around ±25
km s−1 for Si IV and C II lines. The Dopplergrams for
the Mg II line provide structure and dynamics (redshift
and blueshift) of chromospheric plasma, whereas those
for Si IV and C II lines provide structure and dynamics
of transition region plasma (De Pontieu et al. 2014a,b;
Tiwari et al. 2018).

3. RESULTS

We identiﬁed 15 brightening events in the core of the
AR observed by Hi-C, by combining Hi-C data with IRIS
and SDO/AIA data. Based on diﬀerent observed char-
acteristics we assigned each event to one of three cat-
egories: type I – dot-like transient brightening in Hi-C
172 ˚A and AIA 171 ˚A; type II – transient elongated
brightenings along small magnetic loops; and type III
– surge/jet -like transient eruptions with outﬂows often
followed by inﬂows. Most of the observed properties i.e.,
lifetimes, visibility in AIA 94 ˚A (or hot 94), the presence
of mixed-polarity ﬂux, ﬂux convergence, measurable ﬂux
cancellation, ﬂux emergence, ﬁeld-guided ﬂows (assum-
ing all plasma ﬂows and elongations in the UV and EUV
images are along the magnetic ﬁeld), Doppler ﬂows in
Mg II 2796 ˚A (when IRIS slit covers at least a part of the
event), and the presence/absence of underlying neutral
line are listed in Table 1.

We created three movies from Hi-C, IRIS and AIA im-
ages. The ﬁrst movie “hic iris sdo.mp4” contains eight
panels: Hi-C 172, AIA 171, 304, hot 94, IRIS 2796, 1400,
1330 slit-jaw images and SDO/HMI line of sight (LOS)
magnetograms, with LOS magnetic contours (of level
±25 G) plotted on each image. Hot 94 was calculated
by removing warm components from AIA 94 by using
the method of Warren et al. (2012). The second movie
“iris long.mp4” contains six panels:
IRIS 2796, 2832,
1400, 1330 SJ images, AIA 171 images, and HMI LOS
magnetograms with the magnetic contours over plotted
on each frame as in the ﬁrst movie. The third movie
“sdo long.mp4” contains six panels: AIA 171, 304, 193,
211, hot 94 images and HMI LOS magnetograms, with
the magnetic contours over plotted on each image frame.
While the ﬁrst movie spans only the Hi-C observation
time, the second and third movies are for about two
hours, and two and an half hours, respectively, cover-
ing the ﬁve minutes of the Hi-C observations in their
middle. We have also created a Dopplergram movie
(“doppler.mp4”) from the spectral rasters of IRIS for
the Mg II k, C II and Si IV lines to check the Doppler
ﬂows in the covered parts of the events.

3.1. Type I – Dot-like brightening events

In Figure 2 we display the two dot-like round-ish
events, listed in Table 1, appearing in the same Hi-C
frame. Although we display the image in Figure 2 for
the time when both dots appear in the same frame, their
peak brightness times, as listed in Table 1, are slightly
diﬀerent. The dot on the right (in the solar West) is
named Dot 1 as its intensity peaks slightly before the
dot on the left (in the solar East), which is named Dot
2.

aEvent types I, II and III are described in Section 3.
b The lifetime is calculated based on the appearance of the event in Hi-C 172 ˚A, or when outside Hi-C duration, in AIA 171 ˚A.
c a 3-step event
dat the bright end
e there is a delay of 12-40 s in its appearance in AIA 94 ˚A.
f This event looked very similar to type I in Hi-C images, but a careful inspection revealed plasma outﬂows from the bright dot-like location,
therefore we moved it to type III.
g In surges by bidirectional ﬂows we refer to when we see cool plasma outﬂow from the surge-base/source and then inﬂow as well after a while. We
call the ﬂow as unidirectional when we see plasma ﬂow (or it could be intensity propagation, see e.g., De Pontieu et al. (2017)) from one foot of
the loop towards the other, e.g., when in surges we only see outﬂow near the base of a surge and do not see inﬂow (following outﬂow). Note the
ﬂows in AIA 171, 304, 211 ˚A, and in IRIS 2796, 1400, and 1330 ˚A movies.
hThis loop-like event has no evidence of opposite-polarity ﬁeld. This event shows clear outﬂow (or outward intensity propagation). It is ambiguous
whether it should be considered a type III event instead of a type II event.
i In this case only outﬂow (blueshift) from the surge-base is captured by the IRIS slit.
(blueshift) are captured by the IRIS slit.
j Measurable ﬂux cancellation. In all the cases when ﬂux convergence is “yes” but measurable ﬂux cancellation is “No” there is prospective ﬂux
cancellation that cannot be reliably measured because the cancelling ﬂux of either polarity cannot be isolated well enough.

In other ﬁve surges both inﬂow (redshift) and outﬂow

Note—The uncertainties in the lifetimes are based on the temporal cadence, thus depending on the event caught by Hi-C, IRIS or AIA the

uncertainties are smaller or larger. The maximum uncertainty estimated is from two image frames of each instrument.

We show in Figure 4 the magnetic ﬂux evolution of
inspection of contours of
each of our dots. Careful
opposite-polarity magnetic ﬁeld near each dot shows ﬂux
convergence at a “sharp” neutral line (a PIL interval
along which the positive-ﬂux 25 G contour is within a
few pixels of the negative-ﬂux 25 G contour), marked
by arrows in each case. In Dot 1 a small positive polar-
ity ﬂux patch, crossed by the green arrow, is cancelling
at 18:58:32. The overall convergence continues along
the neutral line afterwards; see the location pointed to
by the blue arrow at 18:57:18 and 19:01:47. For Dot 2
a clear emergence of negative ﬂux can be seen, which
cancels with the encountered ambient majority positive
magnetic ﬂux on its south side. The location of its
convergence with the positive polarity magnetic ﬂux is
marked by green arrows in lowest row of Figure 4. Follow
the evolution of these dots in the movie hic iris sdo.mp4.
Because we could isolate the minority-polarity nega-
tive magnetic ﬂux in the extended base of Dot 2 event,
we made a plot of the time evolution of ﬂux in that
negative patch (Figure 4, middle right panel). Flux in-
crease (emergence) is followed by ﬂux decrease (cancel-
lation). We estimate the ﬂux cancellation rate to be
2×1017M x s−1. This and any other ﬂux evolution rates
that we have provided in this paper are crude (order
of magnitude) estimates and should be taken with cau-
tion. With both emergence and cancellation happening
at the same time, which is often the case in our present
study, it is not possible to reliably estimate either the
cancellation rate or the emergence rate from a ﬂux-time
plot.

To investigate formation temperature of each Dot we
made light curves of all AIA EUV and IRIS SJ wave-
lengths. In Figure 5 we display light curves (intensity
integrated over ∼ 2 × 2 arcsec2 ∼ 16 × 16 Hi-C pixel2
∼ 4 × 4 AIA pixel2) from diﬀerent AIA channels, IRIS
wavelengths, and Hi-C images. The area for making
light curves is selected during the peak intensity time,
and is shown as insets on the light curve images (also
true for type II and III events).

All of the AIA and IRIS light curves that peak for
Dot 1 and Dot 2 peak nearly simultaneously in Figure
5. Hi-C 172 and AIA 171 have a double peak for Dot
2, which is compatible with similar two peak behaviours
seen in several other wavelengths. This behaviour is
similar to some of the EUV bright dots found in moss
regions (at the edge of an AR) (R´egnier et al. 2014). We
also calculated error bars (not shown here) for AIA 94
channel to verify the reliability of their light curves. In
particular, we veriﬁed that AIA 94 ˚A intensity peaks are
above noise, and are real. Although the light curves in

Figure 3. A close up look at the two Hi-C dot-like bright-
ening events. The solid and dash-dotted lines in panels (c)
and (d) are two plots at nearby diﬀerent times (solid line
at 18:58:32, dash-dotted line at 18:58:58) when both dots
seem to be apparently brightest. Slight shift in the Dot 2
intensity most probably is a real shift in the location of the
peak intensity of the dot in the given time diﬀerence, but
might be due to smearing of the Hi-C data (Rachmeler et al.
2019). Approximate diameter and brightness enhancement
with respect to the background of the dots are also given.
The diameter of dots (∼2.5 arcsec) is several times larger
than the diameter of Hi-C point spread function (≤0.4 arc-
sec: Kobayashi et al. 2014).

two dots are estimated and given in Figure 3. The av-
erage diameter is 2.5 arcsec and intensity enhancement
is 70% with respect to the background. These numbers
are similar to those for penumbral bright dots (Alpert
et al. 2016), EUV bright dots (R´egnier et al. 2014), and
IBs (Peter et al. 2014).

After we followed closely the Dot 2 event by combining
IRIS movies with Hi-C we found that the base of Dot 2
event is located farther south, on the PIL of cancelling
opposite-polarity magnetic ﬁeld. A loop like structure
extends towards the north from the PIL and Dot 2 in
Hi-C 172 ˚A images appears at the peak time of the loop
in IRIS (see, e.g., 1400 ˚A panel in Figure 2). Therefore
dot-like events apparently are closely connected to loop-
like events, described later. However, the fact that the
Dot 2 event is apparently driven from the cancellation
PIL (an obvious plasma ﬂow to the north from the PIL
is seen in the IRIS 1400 ˚A SJ movie), Dot 2 shares some
properties of type III events, see Section 3.3.

Dot 2: Magnetic ﬂux
convergence and cancellation

Figure 4. Images showing magnetic ﬂux evolution for Dot 1 and Dot 2. A convergence can be noticed at the places pointed to by
green and blue arrows in the top row for Dot 1. These are a small FOV taken from a few frames of the movie “hic iris sdo.mp4”
– the convergence can be more closely followed in the movie. Calculation of ﬂux cancellation rate is not reliably possible here
due to diﬃculty in isolating the ﬂux patch of interest. Probably convergence-driven cancellation that triggers Dot 1 is happening
at the PIL, and triggers a few other fainter brightenings at the location of Dot 1 (see for example the faint brightening in the
third frame of the Hi-C image at 18:59:46). Similar ﬂux evolution for Dot 2 is displayed in the lowest row. Both ﬂux convergence
and ﬂux emergence are visible in the images. The green arrows in the lower panel of stacked Hi-C and HMI images point to
one of the locations where ﬂux convergence is happening. The contours converge on the PIL south of the Dot 2 as the minority
polarity decreases, that is, as the area of minority polarity ﬂux encircled by its contour decreases. We also make a plot showing
negative magnetic ﬂux evolution for Dot 2, shown in the right of the middle row. The FOV used to calculate negative magnetic
ﬂux evolution is shown in the left three panels of the middle row. In the ﬂux evolution plot the Hi-C peak time of Dot 2 is
marked by a dashed black vertical line. The vertical green dashed line marks the time when the event starts appearing in IRIS
SJI 2796 ˚A. The ﬂux is integrated over the area south of Dot 2 because from IRIS SJI 1400 and IRIS SJI 1330 images the
southern part is evidently linked with the Dot 2 brightening – IRIS SJI show that the Dot 2 is near the middle or foot of an
extended loop that starts before and ends after the 172 ˚A Dot 2 disappears. The ﬂux cancellation rate is mentioned on the plot.
Note that magnetic ﬂux is emerging when the event Dot 2 is triggered – probably emergence-driven cancellation is happening
at the PIL.

AIA 94 peak slightly after Hi-C 172/AIA 171 in Dot 1,
these are still near simultaneous.

Although most light curves peak closely together for
both dots, AIA 335, 211, 304, and IRIS SJ 2796 do not
show signiﬁcant peaks for Dot 1. Because there is no
indication that the dots systematically appear in the
hotter passbands (such as hot 94 or AIA 94 ˚A shown
in green) before the cooler ones (such as AIA 171 ˚A
shown in red) these events are diﬀerent from a typical
coronal ﬂare. This behaviour of dot-like events (that the
peak happens in all passbands at the same time without
signiﬁcant delays) is closely similar to the low-lying Hi-C
193 ˚A loop nanoﬂare events studied by Winebarger et al.
(2013). These events are thus evidently at transition-
region temperature. For comparison, an example of a
sub-ﬂare is shown in Appendix A, showing the typical
cooling behaviour observed in coronal ﬂares.

Dot 1 does not show a response or peak in AIA 211 ˚A,
and Dot 2 shows only a weak response, probably because
AIA 211 detects plasma emission from the overlying hot-
ter atmosphere (at 2 MK) and has a response an order
of magnitude lower to the 700,000 K plasma seen by the
Hi-C 172 ˚A ﬁlter and AIA 171 ˚A ﬁlter.

Note that, although hot 94 calculation works relatively
well for hotter AR loops, it may not work so accurately
for tiny, cooler events such as our Hi-C dots due to a
rather complicated thermal response of AIA 94 ˚A (see
e.g., Schmelz et al. 2011; Aschwanden & Boerner 2011;
Del Zanna et al. 2011; Foster & Testa 2011; Testa et al.
2012; Del Zanna 2013). Thus, the appearance of a dot
in the hot 94 image may not suggest dot’s true temper-
ature. This caveat is also valid for type II and type III
events, explored in next two subsections.

We carefully inspected for any dark/bright plasma
ﬂows linked to type I events. We found no apparent
outﬂows (plasma ﬂowing away from dots) or inﬂows
(plasma ﬂowing towards dots) within either of these two
dot events in the Hi-C 172 ˚A and AIA 171 ˚A images.
The IRIS SJ images, however, show plasma upﬂow in the
Dot 2 event, from the brightening (prospective magnetic
reconnection) site south of the dot.

Each event is more elongated in IRIS 1400 SJ images
than in the Hi-C 172 and AIA 171 ˚A images, with the
bright dot seen in Hi-C 172 and AIA 171 being nearly in
the middle of the elongated brightening seen by IRIS. A
cartoon diagram depicting a possible formation mecha-
nism of type I events is shown in Figure 14. We repeat
that the “dot-like” nature only applies to Hi-C 172 ˚A
or AIA 171 ˚A images since IRIS (SJI 1400 and 1330 ˚A)
images show a loop-like feature (covering the Hi-C dot
in the middle or slightly farther north of the feature).
Therefore, as discussed later, the true magnetic struc-

ture of dots might resemble that of either type II events
or type III events.

3.2. Type II – Loop-like events: Elongated brightenings

in small magnetic loops

We noticed several brightening events that are elon-
gated in Hi-C 172 and/or AIA 171 ˚A images and look
like small magnetic loops (see Table 1). In most of these
cases the brightening starts from one end and extends to
the other end. Two of the loop-like brightening events
are shown in Figure 6. Other type II events can be no-
ticed in the movies marked by arrows. Each event listed
in Table 1 is marked by an arrow in Appendix B (Figure
17).

The events (Loop 1 and Loop 3 in Figure 6) are lo-
cated on obvious sharp neutral lines, and the long AIA
movie (sdo long.mp4) shows a trend of ﬂux convergence
in general over the time. We show in Figure 7 ﬂux
convergence at the neutral lines of Loop 1 and Loop 3,
suggesting ﬂux cancellation being involved in triggering
these events. However it is diﬃcult to isolate either of
the magnetic polarities here and therefore a reliable es-
timate of magnetic ﬂux cancellation rate is not possible
in these cases. The same is true for the other loop-like
events. Therefore, we can only infer the possibility of
ﬂux cancellation in these cases in which the cancelling
ﬂux cannot be isolated well enough to reliably measure
the amount of ﬂux cancellation.

Interestingly, the Loop 2 (at 18:59:02) does not show
a neutral line in the ±25 G level contours. Nonetheless
because the Loop 2 event is a ‘ﬂare-like’ explosive en-
ergy release (similar to all of our events) the magnetic
ﬂux presumably has a neutral line. In any case, other
mechanisms (than ﬂux cancellation) are possible in each
of our type I and type II events. One such mechanism
could be the convective driving of braiding from the feet
of the loop leading to the event (Parker 1983a, 1988; Ti-
wari et al. 2014). Another possibility is that braiding
from the feet built up the free-energy in the loop and
then the event was triggered by waves produced from
photospheric convection and p-mode oscillations (Ning
et al. 2004; Moriyasu et al. 2004; Chen & Priest 2006;
Heggland et al. 2009). Alternatively, wave dissipation
without the presence of any braiding in the loops can
also lead to transient heating events (Osterbrock 1961;
Heyvaerts & Priest 1983).

Although proposed for coronal heating in quiet so-
lar regions, ﬂux tube tectonics heating model by Priest
et al. (2002) may be equally valid in the closed loop sys-
tem of the AR core. Any lateral motions of the surface
magnetic ﬂux in such a closed loop system can drive
transient heating in the chromospheric/coronal separa-

to by arrows in Figure 2. To avoid confusion due to overlaps, light curves for each dot (and for all other events discussed later)
are plotted in two panels. The Hi-C area selected for making light curves is displayed as a small inset in the left panel for each
dot during its peak intensity time in Hi-C. The vertical dashed line in each panel marks the peak time of the event in Hi-C 172
˚A, as listed in Table 1.

Hi-C 2.1 observations of fine-scale coronal energy release

trix surfaces of current sheets by fast reconnection (or
in a turbulent manner, see e.g., Zank et al. (2018)).

Because there is a hint of weak negative magnetic ﬂux
(below ±25 G) at the right/West end of this event (Loop
2), we can not rule out the possibility of this event be-
ing a very tiny surge-like event (type III), discussed in
Section 3.3.

In Figure 8 we display light curves (intensity inte-
grated over ∼ 2×2 arcsec2 ∼ 16×16 Hi-C pixel2 ∼ 4×4
AIA pixel2) of Loops 1 and 3 in diﬀerent AIA channels,
IRIS wavelengths and Hi-C images. Light curves for
other loops listed in Table 1 can be found in Appendix
D. Most of the plots peak nearly simultaneously. Note
that neither hot 94 nor any of the IRIS light curves
show a peak in the Loop 3 event, which is a particu-
larly prominent loop. The absence of Loop 3 in IRIS
SJI and in hot 94 together suggests this loop forms in
the transition-region. Consistently, Peter et al. (2019a)
show that in this event there are simultaneous cool loops
in IRIS but they are not co-spatial – there is a small but
signiﬁcant oﬀset between the warm/hot Hi-C loop and
cool IRIS loops, as can be seen in Figure 6.

We do not ﬁnd the systematic cooling sequence in any
of the loop events (an example of such sequential cooling
in a small ﬂare is shown in Appendix A). Thus similar
to type I events, type II events also do not behave like
coronal ﬂares, and are cooler (of transition-region ori-
gin).

In most of type II events brightening starts from one
end and moves to the other end. In a few cases both
outﬂow (plasma ﬂowing away from the bright end) and
inﬂow (plasma ﬂowing towards the bright end) signa-
tures of hot (bright in most channels) plasma can be
noticed. However it is diﬃcult to conclude from the im-
ages if these are plasma ﬂows or only apparent motions
(e.g., heating fronts, propagation of shocks, etc).

We explain via a cartoon in Figure 14 how type I
and type II could be similar in magnetic conﬁguration
and reconnection, and how type Is could be either sym-
metrically heated (true dots) or actually asymmetrically
heated as in type II, depending on the visibility of heated
loops.

3.3. Type III – Surge-like eruptions

We found another (third) dot-like event in the Hi-C
images (at 19:01:56 UT; named as Surge 4 in Table 1),
but careful inspection showed cool plasma outﬂow from
the event followed by a weak inﬂow. This behaviour
is similar to a weak surge/jet activity. When we fol-
lowed AIA and IRIS movies in time beyond the Hi-C
time range, in the core of the Hi-C AR, we found sev-
eral other surge-like activities in that plasma shoots up,

travels along a long loop, and then sometimes drains
back. The IRIS slit has covered the shooting end of
these events in some cases allowing us to create Doppler-
grams to detect the ﬂows. Two example type III events
are shown in Figure 9. The base of the surge-like activ-
ity is pointed to by a white arrow in each panel. A cool
plasma outﬂow from the base is also marked by a green
arrow in each panel – plasma outﬂow is most clearly
visible in Hi-C 172, AIA 171, and AIA 304. The surge
extends to the right and then (more clearly visible in
AIA 304, 171, and 211) drains back towards the base
(see movies sdo long.mp4, and iris long.mp4).

In all type III events the presence of mixed-polarity
ﬂux, ﬂux emergence, convergence and cancellation are
clearly visible. In Figure 10 we show ﬂux emergence, and
convergence-driven cancellation taking place in Surge 4
and Surge 6. Although convergence-driven ﬂux cancel-
lation seems to be clearly responsible for triggering some
type III events, there are some clear examples of type III
events happening during the emergence of the minority
polarity ﬂux. We show in Appendix E ﬂux evolution
plots for the four other type III events. Because in each
of the type III (surge) events plasma ﬁrst shoots up (or
to the right along the magnetic ﬁeld lines) and there is
ﬂux cancellation going on at the base, these together
suggest that the ﬂux cancellation prepares and triggers
the eruption that drives the plasma outﬂows.

The light curves (intensity integrated over ∼ 2 × 2
arcsec2 ∼ 16 × 16 Hi-C pixel2 ∼ 4 × 4 AIA pixel2) of dif-
ferent AIA channels, IRIS wavelengths for Surges 4 and
6 are plotted in Figure 11. Light curves for other surges
listed in Table 1 can be found in Appendix D. Similar
to as for type I and type II events all the light curves for
type III peak nearly simultaneously suggesting that we
see the cooler plasma detected by the hotter channels, so
that these events are cooler/chromospheric/transition-
region events (as in Winebarger et al. 2013).

Note that hot 94 does show intensity enhancement
in Surge 6, but not in Surge 4. Nonetheless neither of
the two examples nor any of the other type III events
show a systematic cooling pattern. Thus they are likely
not coronal ﬂare-like events. However, some of their ap-
pearance in hot 94 (Fe XVIII emission) suggests that
these events might be heated up to 6 MK or more.
In those cases (because intensities peak together with
cooler wavelengths) the cooling must be very fast so
that the heating can be balanced merely by radiative
cooling (probably conduction does not play a role, thus
no signiﬁcant time lag is seen). However, such a scenario
would require very high plasma density, which is not es-
timated in the present work. Further, the calculation of

Loop 3 in Table 1. The location of the loop in each case is also pointed out by the white arrow in IRIS SJI 2796, IRIS SJI 1400,
AIA 171, AIA 304, and AIA hot 94 ˚A images. The red and yellow contours are for positive and negative LOS magnetic ﬁeld at
a level of ±25 G. For better visibility red color is replaced by green for contours on IRIS SJI 1400 and AIA 304 ˚A images, and

(upper panel) and Loop 3 (lower panel). The green arrows point to the locations where ﬂux convergence is more obvious, although
convergence is happening all along the neutral line in longer time span (see the movies hic iris sdo.mp4, and sdo long.mp4).
Contours are the same as in other images and movies.

hot 94 emission might have uncertainties, particularly
during a ﬂare (Warren et al. 2012).

We can not rule out the possibility of some of these
events being multi-thermal. The emission at 6 MK may
become weak very fast due to the expansion, or because
it is obscured by EUV absorption.

The IRIS spectra did not cover any of the type I or
II events but did cover bases of most of the Type III
events. Thus, it is possible that type I and II events also
had outﬂows (though unobserved). Therefore, the idea
that they could also be due to some kind of unresolved
surge-like eruptive process cannot be ruled out. We
made Dopplergrams to verify upﬂows/outﬂows (plasma
ﬂowing away from the base of the surge) and/or down-
ﬂows/inﬂows (plasma ﬂowing towards the base of the
surge) at or near the base of surges and to see if there is a
twisting of the magnetic ﬁeld, similar to jets (Schmieder
et al. 2013; Cheung et al. 2015; Moore et al. 2015; Pane-
sar et al. 2016, 2017; Sterling et al. 2017; Tiwari et al.
2018), which is generally expected in ﬂux rope eruptions.
The Dopplergrams (Figure 12) near the base of surges
for each of the three wavelengths (IRIS 2796, 1400,
1330 ˚A) often show simultaneous redshift and blueshift
next to each other, which reveals simultaneous up-
ﬂow and downﬂow patterns during the onset of surge
events. In most cases a clear outﬂow is evident near the
bright source/base of the surges, consistent with similar
blueshift found in Hα surges by Canﬁeld et al. (1996).
Because the redshift and blueshift are not on the top of
each other (across a surge/jet, which could then suggest
twisting motion, see e.g., Tiwari et al. (2018)), rather

they are side by side (along a surge), we interpret this
as plasma downﬂow and upﬂow along surge. Thus, no
clear Doppler signatures of twisting motions are found
(in which across the elongated axis of the surge/jet the
LOS velocity on one side is toward the observer and the
LOS velocity on the other side is away from the observer
(e.g., Tiwari et al. 2018)).

In the Dopplergrams for the Surge 4 event (Figure 12),
the strong red-shifted point sits on the AIA 171 dot, and
the blue-shifted feature is on the outﬂow site seen in the
AIA 171 movie. These Dopplergrams show no evidence
of spin in the outﬂow, but show only the component of
the outﬂow velocity along the line of sight. Thus, the
Hi-C 172 dot-like brightening in this case is a jet-base
bright point, and it is compatible with the idea of surge
formation in Figure 15, that it should have downﬂow in
it giving the redshift in the IRIS spectra. In Figure 13
spectra along two slit positions during the peak of events
Surge 4 and Surge 6 are displayed, which, consistent
with the Dopplergrams, show redshifts and blueshifts.

4. DISCUSSION

We report on three types of small-scale explosive en-
ergy release, sudden brightening events, in the core of
an active region observed by a unique combination of
instruments – Hi-C, IRIS, and SDO/AIA. We ﬁrst char-
acterize the transient brightening activity that we no-
ticed in the Hi-C 172 ˚A images: type I – a conﬁned
dot-like brightening event, never reported before in the
core of an AR, type II – an elongated brightening in and
along a short magnetic loop. We then investigate a third

for each of these surges. The peak time of the event is marked by a dashed black vertical line. The vertical green dashed line
marks the time when the event starts appearing in SJI of Mg II 2796 ˚A. The emergence, convergence and cancellation are also
visible for each event in the movie hic iris sdo.mp4. The ﬂux cancellation rate is mentioned on the plots. Evidently magnetic
ﬂux emergence (and convergence, see contours at neutral lines marked by green arrows) - driven cancellation at the PIL triggers
these events.

intensity of the Hi-C images drops quickly after 19:01:20 UT (e.g., see Figure 7 of Rachmeler et al. (2019)), the images after
this time are not usable for making light curves and thus the Hi-C light curve is not plotted for Surge 4. The vertical dashed
lines mark times for the peak brightness of the events in AIA 171 ˚A. Due to the integrated area of the SJI covering a few (dark)

type of event occurring in the same region – type III –
a surge/jet-like eruption.

Each of our events (with one exception) shows the
presence of mixed-polarity magnetic ﬁeld (with sharp
neutral line/s shown by ±25 G contours) at the base,
often with ongoing ﬂux convergence. We show quantita-
tive evidence of ﬂux cancellation in seven cases, and infer
the presence of ﬂux cancellation in other cases based on
the observed ﬂux convergence. Although we do not rule
out other possibilities, the observations of ﬂux conver-
gence at the base of events suggests that ﬂux cancella-
tion could play an important role in triggering several
of these events, in accord with many recent similar ﬁnd-
ings of ﬂux cancellation leading to jet eruptions (Huang
et al. 2015; Panesar et al. 2016, 2017; Tiwari et al. 2016,
2018; Sterling et al. 2017, 2018; Panesar et al. 2018a;
L´opez Fuentes et al. 2018). As was ﬁrst proposed by van
Ballegooijen & Martens (1989) and Moore & Roumelio-
tis (1992), and has been observationally conﬁrmed (e.g.,
Panesar et al. 2016, 2017, 2018a,b; Tiwari et al. 2018;
Sterling et al. 2018; Chintzoglou et al. 2019), the pro-
cess of ﬂux cancellation (driven by converging photo-
spheric ﬂows) can prepare and trigger the magnetic ﬁeld
that explodes in a ﬂare eruption. The magnetic explo-
sion is either conﬁned (does not produce a surge, jet,
or CME) or ejective (produces a surge, jet, or CME)
(e.g., Machado et al. 1988; Moore et al. 2001). Some of
our small-scale events occur during ﬂux emergence sug-
gesting that emergence-driven cancellation prepares and
triggers some of these events, the preparing again being
by ﬂux cancellation in the manner of van Ballegooijen
& Martens (1989), and the triggering again being by
ﬂux cancellation in the manner of Moore & Roumeliotis
(1992).

Although observed in a diﬀerent wavelength, our dot-
like brightening events have much visual similarity with
IRIS bombs (Peter et al. 2014) and Ellerman bombs
(Rutten et al. 2013). However, EBs are much cooler
(<10,000 K), have much longer lifetimes, and are more
stable/continuous/repetitive brightenings than our dot-
like small-scale events reported here. Thus, the observed
IRIS bombs (Pe-
dot-like events are not simply EBs.
ter et al. 2014) have more visual similarities with our
dot-like events – they are hotter than EBs, and have a
similar size and intensity enhancement with respect to
background as our dot-like events, and they are all found
near mixed-polarity ﬂux and sharp neutral lines. How-
ever both EBs (∼560 s: Watanabe et al. (2011) ) and
IBs (∼5 minutes) have much longer lifetimes than of our
Hi-C dot-like events (∼70 seconds). A caution with this
interpretation is made at the end of next paragraph.

Further, IBs and our dot-like events are apparently
seen at diﬀerent temperatures. Peter et al. (2014) found
that IBs show no brightenings in AIA 171 ˚A, whereas our
dot-like events are seen in Hi-C 172 ˚A. Thus, our dot-like
events (Type Is) are apparently much hotter and briefer
explosions than those of IRIS bombs. A caveat is that
AIA 171 channel emission might suﬀer with bound-free
absorption, which could lead to a shorter lifetimes of our
dot-like events. Moreover, the Hi-C passband covers O
V/VI lines, which form at a much lower temperature.
Thus, it is possible that we see cool transition-region
contamination in the AIA and Hi-C passbands. This
subject thus remains open for further investigation.

Note that type I events are also visible in AIA 171 ˚A
but not as outstandingly as in Hi-C, and so remained un-
noticed earlier and were not reported before in the core
of ARs. There are similar bright dots reported in the
past elsewhere in the solar atmosphere e.g., in sunspot
penumbra using IRIS data (Tian et al. 2014) and Hi-C 1
(in 193 ˚A) data (Alpert et al. 2016), in the surroundings
of the Hi-C 1 AR (R´egnier et al. 2014). The ‘sparkling’
bright dots in the moss region (at the edge of the AR)
of Hi-C 1, studied by R´egnier et al. (2014) have shorter
lifetimes (25 s) and are smaller (700 km) than our dots.
These sparkling bright dots form in EUV corona, having
a temperature of 1 – 1.5 MK, similar to that of our dots.
The moving bright dots in sunspot penumbra were
proposed to form due to impact of strong downﬂows
from the corona into the diverse-density chromosphere/
transition-region, or by magnetic reconnection in two
ﬁeld lines inclined at diﬀerent angles (Alpert et al. 2016).
The dots in plage area surrounding ARs were proposed
to be a result of nanoﬂares high in the moss loops
(R´egnier et al. 2014). The formation mechanism of the
present dot-like brightening events seem to be diﬀerent –
these are located at or near sharp PILs and so are plau-
sibly triggered by ﬂux cancellation or by ﬂux emergence
(that drives ﬂux cancellation on its outside: Moore &
Roumeliotis (1992)), which was not the case in the EUV
bright dots at the edge of Hi-C 1 AR, or in penumbral
moving bright dots.

Most of the type II loop-like events also have mixed-
polarity magnetic ﬁeld (with sharp neutral lines) on the
photosphere but ﬂux cancellation is not as clearly visible
as in type I or in type III events. However a careful
inspection reveals the presence of ﬂux convergence along
the sharp neutral line, plausibly driving cancellation,
accompanied by the loop brightening. The presence of
mixed-polarity ﬁeld and/or ﬂux cancellation has been
recently reported to play an important role in coronal
loop heating and is proposed to be present at least at
one footpoint of a bright coronal loop (Tiwari et al. 2014,

20

Tiwari et al.

2017; Chitta et al. 2017b; Priest et al. 2018). Here we
show smaller loop events than earlier reported ones but
some of these might share the heating mechanism with
those coronal loops with mixed-polarity ﬁeld at least at
one foot.

We note the following caveat: The presence of a neu-
tral line in short loops does not necessarily mean there
must be ﬂux cancellation. Short, low-lying loops, obvi-
ously have opposite-polarity magnetic ﬁeld in proximity
and thus occur close to the neutral line, and thus may
have ﬂux cancellation. Therefore, whether most of the
bright loops form because of ﬂux cancellation (that re-
sults from submergence of short loops made by magnetic
reconnection of the legs of adjacent sheared loops driven
together at the PIL by convection) remains elusive.

Several alternative mechanisms are plausible to gen-
erate types I and II events. E.g., random footpoint
shuﬄing of magnetic loops can braid the loops, which
can lead to the events by reconnections in the form of
nanoﬂares (sudden current dissipation) (Parker 1983a,
1988). The heating could also be caused by wave dissi-
pation (e.g., Osterbrock 1961; Heyvaerts & Priest 1983).
Reconnection events could be also triggered by waves
(produced from the photospheric convection at loop-
foot: Heggland et al. 2009), or by external triggering of
loops (Tiwari et al. 2014). As discussed before, ﬂux tube
tectonics heating model also predicts low-lying smaller
loops to possess enhanced heating (Priest et al. 2002).

Because in most of type II events brightenings start
at one end and move towards the other end along the
loop, it is possible that type II events are formed in the
same way as type III events.

If they peak, the light curves from all AIA and
IRIS channels (for all of these events) peak nearly at
the same time. Note that in a few cases, e.g.,
in
Loop 3 in Figure 8, IRIS SJ intensity do not show
a consistent peak in the light curves. Similarly, al-
though many of our events do, some do not show a
peak in hot 94. However, none of our events dis-
play a systematic cooling pattern as seen for typical
coronal solar ﬂares. Thus, our events are either cool
(at chromospheric/transition-region temperature) i.e., a
cool contamination to coronal passbands, or they are
broadly iso-thermal (in sub-structures/strands), simi-
lar to the low-lying loop nanoﬂare events reported by
Winebarger et al. (2013). If the latter is true, then the
cooling time in each strand might be so short that the
heating is balanced by radiative cooling.

Type III events show clear ﬂux cancellation and
plasma outﬂow from the source region, often followed by
plasma inﬂow. These events have a dot-like structure
at the source region in Hi-C 172 ˚A (when available)

and AIA 171 ˚A images. Therefore, if surges are very
small and do not show a clear outﬂow they can be mis-
taken to be type I events. We suspect Dot 2 is a type
III event. Thus, Dots 1 and 2, and any other dot-like
events, might be made in the same way as a type II or
a type III event. Similarly, some type II events can be
interpreted as small type III events, as we suspect in
the case of Loop 2.

Dopplergrams of type III events provide conﬁrming
evidence of plasma outﬂows along the ﬁeld during its
initial phase and inﬂows during the later phase. The
eruption triggered by ﬂux cancellation (due to submer-
gence of lower reconnected loop) evidently drives out-
ﬂows – if similar ﬂux cancellation were to occur at both
feet of a loop system these could drive simultaneous bi-
directional ﬂows, which will be similar to the well known
counter-streaming ﬂows in large classical ﬁlaments (e.g.,
Alexander et al. 2013). However this remains only spec-
ulation in absence of a clear evidence of such counter-
streaming ﬂows in the core of the Hi-C AR studied here.
In Table 1 only one event (type II, Loop 2) does not
contain a clear neutral line shown by ±25 G contours.
This could be either due to the absence of mixed-polarity
ﬁeld, or the minority polarity ﬂux may be below the de-
tection limit of the SDO/HMI instrument. A more de-
tailed future study with higher resolution vector magne-
tograms e.g., obtained by DKIST (Rimmele et al. 2018)
or other new generation solar telescopes would conﬁrm
or deny the proposed scenario of the formation of loop-
like events.

4.1. Proposed Conﬁguration and Reconnection of the

Magnetic Field in Each Event Type

Here we present simplistic 2D schematic drawings for
the magnetic ﬁeld and its reconnection that could pro-
duce the events studied here. As discussed earlier, type
I could be the same as type II – both seem to be of-
ten elongated (particularly visible when seen in IRIS
SJI) – at some phase of these events a loop like elon-
gated structure can be noticed. This suggests that dot-
like events are basically similar to loop-like events but
with more conﬁned extension of a reconnection-resultant
loop. Plausibly IRIS sees both the upper and lower loops
that are made and heated by magnetic reconnection and
the Hi-C 172 and AIA 171 images show only the upper
loop because the upper loop is hot enough to show in
Hi-C 172 and AIA 171 ˚A images, but the lower loop is
not hot enough. Both of these are found mostly located
at or near mixed-polarity ﬁeld/neutral lines.

The cartoon diagram shown in Figure 14 proposes a
possible formation mechanism for type I and II bright-
ening events. The magnetic reconnection (indicated by

ration and reconnection of the sheared and twisted bipolar
magnetic ﬁeld in ﬁne-scale explosive energy release events of
type I (dot-like) and type II (loop-like). The thick black line
is the photospheric surface. The plus and minus signs give
the polarity of the photospheric magnetic ﬂux. The curves
represent crossed ﬁeld loops projected on a vertical plane
perpendicular to the polarity inversion line (PIL). The PIL
lies along the view direction and is midway between the plus
sign and the ﬁrst minus sign to the right of the plus sign.
Blue curves are for ﬁeld that has not yet undergone recon-
nection. Red curves are for reconnected ﬁeld. In drawings
(a) and (b), the right leg of the left blue loop is in front of
the left leg of the right blue loop. In drawing (b), the red
X marks the site of ongoing reconnection between those two
loop legs, the two solid-line loops are for a type I event, the
dashed curve depicts that the right loop has a longer right-
ward reach in a type II event, and the red arrows denote the
outﬂow of the upper and lower reconnected ﬁeld loops and
their plasma.
In drawing (c), the lower solid curve is the
lower reconnected ﬁeld loop in a type I event as well as in a
type II event, the upper solid curve is the upper reconnected
ﬁeld loop in a type I event, and the dashed curve depicts that
the upper reconnected ﬁeld loop as a greater rightward reach
in a type II event. Note that this depiction is a possibility
for type I and type II events whether or not the pre-event
magnetic ﬁeld is prepared and triggered by ﬂux cancellation
at the PIL. The pre-event ﬁeld might instead be twisted by
convection in the loop feet and perhaps triggered by the same
convection or p-mode oscillations.

Figure 15. Schematic depiction of the proposed conﬁgu-
ration, eruption, and reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld in
ﬁne-scale explosive energy release events of type III, each of
which is a surge/jet-like eruption from a ﬁne-scale island of
minority-polarity (negative) ﬂux that is undergoing cancel-
lation with the majority-polarity (positive) ﬂux in the east
end of the arch ﬁlament system. The style and meaning of
the symbols, lines, curves and color are the same as in Figure
14. Here, each curve is either a ﬁeld line in or the projection
of a ﬁeld line onto a vertical plane through the center of a
negative-ﬂux island in surrounding positive ﬂux. Rightward
is heliographic west; leftward is east.
In drawing (a), the
curled ﬁeld straddles the PIL on the west edge of the island
and is in a twisted ﬂux rope (viewed end-on from the south)
that has been built by ﬂux cancellation driven at the PIL by
convergence of convection ﬂow in and below the photosphere.
This ﬂux rope is the core of a sheared magnetic arcade that
straddles the PIL and that, as a result of further ﬂux cancel-
lation at the PIL, is triggered to start erupting in the time
between drawing (a) and drawing (b). In drawing (b), the
erupting arcade is driving: (1) external reconnection with
encountered far-reaching ﬁeld that reaches to the west end
of the arch ﬁlament system, and (2) internal reconnection of
the legs of the erupting arcade. The external reconnection
drives westward plasma ﬂow out along the reconnected far-
reaching ﬁeld. The internal reconnection builds a miniature
ﬂare arcade that is seen in Hi-C and AIA coronal EUV im-
ages (registered with HMI magnetograms) as a bright point
located on the cancellation PIL of the magnetic island. In
drawing (c), the eruption and reconnection have ended and
some of the previously ejected plasma is draining back to the
foot of the reconnected far-reaching ﬁeld.

the red X in panel b) occurs between the legs of two
sheared ﬁeld loops (one in front of the X, the other be-
hind) that are perhaps sheared and pushed together by
photospheric shearing convection merging at the PIL.
We note that this picture (presented in Figure 14) is a
speculation based on the magnetic settings and evolu-
tion of magnetic ﬁux in the photosphere – to the best
of our (and an anonymous referee’s) knowledge no theo-
retical model or computational simulation that tests this
speciﬁc scenario is available. However, we note that the
magnetic topology and reconnection depicted in Figure
14 and their rationale are essentially those for any one
of the nanoﬂare reconnection events proposed by Parker
(1983b,a, 1988) for coronal heating in a closed magnetic
loop, each nanoﬂare burst of reconnection occurring at
a current sheet built in the body of the loop by photo-
spheric convection in the loop’s feet.

Similar to type II events, type Is are conﬁned (no ob-
vious ejective outﬂow), but unlike type IIs type I events
are brightest in the middle, not brightest on one end.
Thus, type Is could be the same as type II (loop) events
except they are shorter and more symmetrically heated.
An alternative possibility of the formation of type II
loop-like events (and possibly of dot-like events) is given
in the following. A few of these cases, particularly in
the type II (loop eruptions with mostly unidirectional
ﬂow), have ﬂux emergence before ﬂux cancellation, thus
suggesting a loop-loop-interaction scenario (with three
legged magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration), as suggested by
Hanaoka (1997) for ﬂares, jets, and surges. The loop-
loop interaction may cause component reconnection of
crossed ﬂux tubes rooted in the same-polarity magnetic
ﬂux.

Type III events most clearly show ﬂux emergence
and cancellation at the driver end. Plausibly, the ﬂux-
emergence-driven cancellation at the neutral line pre-
pares and triggers a ﬁne scale core-magnetic-ﬁeld struc-
ture (a small sheared/twisted core ﬁeld or ﬂux rope
along and above the cancellation line) to explode. A
cartoon diagram depicting this formation scenario for
type III surge-like events is shown in Figure 15. The
ﬂow patterns (redshift in the left/East and blueshift in
the right/West) in the panel (b) is consistent with that
observed in Dopplergrams, see e.g., Figure 12, and movie
doppler.mp4.

As mentioned before, type I and type II events might
be smaller versions of type III event, and all the three
kinds of events could form in the same way as proposed
in Figure 15.
In that case each of our types I and II
events may occur at an embedded ﬂux island that is
near the neutral line but is too small/weak to be de-
tected in the HMI magnetograms. The ﬁeld conﬁgura-

tion sketched in Figure 14 is for any type I or type II
event in which HMI sees only a single long neutral line
and no embedded ﬂux island.

The eruption that drives the production of the

emergence, ﬂux cancellation leads to and triggers the
jet/surge eruption. A twisted ﬂux rope forms by ﬂux
cancellation (van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Panesar
et al. 2017; Sterling et al. 2018), which is then triggered
(to erupt and drive internal and external reconnections
as in Figure 15) by further ﬂux cancellation (van Bal-
legooijen & Martens 1989; Panesar et al. 2016, 2017;
Sterling et al. 2017; Panesar et al. 2018a,b). Recent
theoretical models support this scenario (Wyper et al.
2017, 2019). Earlier models of X-ray bright points
also showed that ﬂux cancellation can drive small-scale
brightening events (e.g., Priest et al. 1994). The mag-
netic conﬁguration as shown in Figure 15 is similar to
the conﬁguration as found in UV bursts. There, follow-
ing ﬂux emergence the minority polarity cancels with
the majority polarity of opposite sign (Chitta et al.
2017a). Another recent reconnection modelling shows
a similar situation as drawn in our Figure 15, which is
found to lead to a bi-directional jet (Peter et al. 2019b).
In their numerical modeling Shibata et al. (1992a),
and Yokoyama & Shibata (1995, 1996) showed that re-
connection between emerging magnetic ﬂux and overly-
ing magnetic ﬁeld can create surges, thus advocating for
magnetic reconnection as an essential process for large
(ﬂares) to small (jets and surges) scale events. The ﬁeld
aligned ﬂows in surges (or apparent intensity propaga-
tion in loops) might be accelerated by the enhanced gas
pressure behind the shocks driven by magnetic recon-
nection. The cool and hot plasma could be ejected in
this process (Shibata et al. 1992b; Yokoyama & Shi-
bata 1996). Because we observe both, magnetic ﬂux
emergence and cancellation, the surges might be formed
in the way as proposed by Shibata et al. (1992a,b);
Yokoyama & Shibata (1995, 1996).

We would like to stress that most of the observed
ﬂux cancellation is plausibly a result of submergence of
short loops made by convection-driven magnetic recon-
nection. This is what is also shown in Figures 14 and 15.
When we mention ﬂux cancellation prepares and trig-
gers an event that means a small ﬂux-rope/miniﬁlament
is formed in the way proposed by van Ballegooijen &
Martens (1989) and then runaway internal reconnection
under the ﬂux rope (in the lower solar atmosphere, say
in the chromosphere; of course these heights are set by
the size of the closed ﬁeld lobes of the jet base) un-
leashes the eruption that drives external reconnection

Moore et al. 2001; Sterling et al. 2015; Panesar et al.
2016, 2017; Tiwari et al. 2018; Wyper et al. 2017).

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have reported small-scale explosive energy release
events observed in the core of the AR observed by Hi-C
2.1. We ﬁnd three types of transient brightening events:
type I dot-like, type II loop-like, and type III surge/jet-
like. Most of the events we studied here are located at
or near sharp neutral lines, and some show clear evi-
dence of ﬂux cancellation, often led or followed by ﬂux
emergence. Emergence-driven or converging-ﬂow-driven
ﬂux cancellation plausibly prepares and triggers several
of the three types of events we investigated.

We also mention other possible mechanisms, e.g.,
these events could be sudden energy release by wave dis-
sipation, or by nanoﬂares in braided loops (either pro-
duced by footpoint shuﬄing or induced by waves). Dot-
like events ﬁt being a part of either loop-like events or
surge-like events. Based on the similarities in intensity
propagation and the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld setting
and evolution of several of types I and II events with
type III events, one can expect type I and type II events
to be smaller versions of type III events. However, to
conﬁrm this further detailed investigation of more cases
with Hi-C-like or better instrumentation is required.

The IRIS spectra available for type III events show
complex activities at their base, and upﬂowing cool ma-
terial; as expected in a surge/jet activity these events
show outﬂows in the initial phase and inﬂows in the late
phase. Because the light curves (from Hi-C, IRIS, and
diﬀerent AIA channels) for most of type I, II and III
events peak nearly simultaneously, and for none of the

events show a coronal-ﬂare trend of cooling, all three
types (except for those clearly showing up in hot 94
˚A images – in them the cooling time is so short that
the heating is balanced by radiation) apparently have
transition-region and/or chromospheric (and not coro-
nal) temperature, but see Section 4 for caveats.

A. LIGHT CURVES FOR A SUB-FLARE IN THE HI-C ACTIVE REGION

We plot AIA light curves for a small ﬂare in the Hi-C AR during 18:39:33 – 18:59:50 UT for a comparison with the
light curves for our three types of events studied in this paper. These light curves show a systematic cooling sequence
similar to observed in typical solar coronal ﬂares.

Figure 16. Light curves (right panel) from AIA intensity images for a sub-ﬂare event peaking in AIA 94 at 18:43:59 UT. The
area for the light curves is outlined by a black box in an hot 94 image of the sub-ﬂare (on the left panel). See the ﬂare evolution
in the movie sdo long.mp4. A systematic cooling in this small ﬂare can be seen in the light curves – note the time sequence of
the peaks of the successively cooler channels: hot 94/AIA 94, 335, 211, 193, and then AIA 171.

Figure 17. An image frame of each of the events (during their peak time) as listed in Table 1. Each of these are frames from
either Hi-C 172 ˚A movie “hic iris sdo.mp4” (when available) or from AIA 171 ˚A movie “sdo long.mp4”. Each event is pointed
to by a green arrow.

C. EXAMPLES OF UNIDIRECTIONAL AND BIDIRECTIONAL FLOWS

Figure 18. An example of unidirectional ﬂow (in Loop 2) and bidirectional ﬂow (in Surge 6). These image frames are for
reference, the ﬂows (seen as intensity propagations) are more obvious in the movies.

D. LIGHT CURVES OF OTHER NINE EVENTS LISTED IN TABLE 1

Figure 19. Light curves from AIA and IRIS intensity images over Hi-C time for Loop 2. The Hi-C area selected for making
light curves is displayed as a small inset in the left panel during its peak intensity time in Hi-C. Due to the integrated area of
the SJI covering a few (dark) pixels from a dust patch some of the IRIS light curves show a repeated ﬂuctuations. The dashed
vertical line marks the peak time of the event.

Figure 20. Light curves from AIA and IRIS intensity images for Loops 4 and 5. The AIA 171 ˚A area selected for making light
curves is displayed as a small inset in the left panel for each loop during its peak intensity time in AIA 171 ˚A. The vertical
dashed lines mark times for the peak brightness of the events in AIA 171 ˚A.

Figure 21. Light curves from AIA and IRIS intensity images for Loops 6 and 7. The AIA 171 ˚A area selected for making light
curves is displayed as a small inset in the left panel for each loop during its peak intensity time in AIA 171 ˚A. The vertical
dashed lines mark times for the peak brightness of the events in AIA 171 ˚A. Loop 6 is a double peak event. For Loop 7, the
IRIS observation time ends soon after the peak time of the event.

Figure 22. Light curves from AIA and IRIS intensity images for Surges 1 and 2. The AIA 171 ˚A area selected for making light
curves is displayed as a small inset in the left panel for each surge during its peak intensity time in AIA 171 ˚A. The vertical
dashed lines mark times for the peak brightness of the events in AIA 171 ˚A. Note that for Surge 1 the IRIS coverage starts after
the event has already started.

curves is displayed as a small inset in the left panel for each surge during its peak intensity time in AIA 171 ˚A. The vertical
dashed lines mark times for the peak brightness of the events in AIA 171 ˚A. For Surge 5, AIA 171 ˚A (in particular) shows a
double peak in the light curve.

E. MAGNETIC FLUX EVOLUTION IN SURGES DISPLAYING FLUX EMERGENCE AND CANCELLATION

Surge 1: Magnetic ﬂux

emergence and cancellation

Surge 2: Magnetic ﬂux

evolution/cancellation

Figure 24. Magnetic ﬂux evolution showing emergence and cancellation in Surge 1 and Surge 2. Small FOV covering the base
of Surge 1 and Surge 2 (AIA 171, IRIS SJI 1330, and HMI LOS magnetogram) are shown in the upper left panels for both
Surge 1 and Surge 2 – same FOV is used to calculate ﬂux evolution plots (negative ﬂux for both) shown in the upper rightmost
panels for each of these surges. The peak time of the event is marked by a dashed black vertical line. The vertical green dashed
line marks the time when the event starts appearing in AIA 304 or SJI of Mg II 2796 ˚A. The emergence, convergence and
cancellation are also visible for each event in the movie hic iris sdo.mp4. The ﬂux cancellation rate is mentioned on the plots.
Evidently magnetic ﬂux emergence (and convergence) - driven cancellation at the PIL triggers these events.
