ABSTRACT
In this paper we present the ﬁrst results ever obtained by applying the autoregressive
(AR) technique to the precipitable water vapour (PWV). The study is performed at
the Very Large Telescope. The AR technique has been recently proposed to provide
forecasts of atmospheric and astroclimatic parameters at short time scales (up to
a few hours) by achieving much better performances with respect to the ’standard
forecasts’ provided early afternoon for the coming night. The AR method uses the real-
time measurements of the parameter of interest to improve the forecasts performed
with atmospherical models. We used here measurements provided by LHATPRO, a
radiometer measuring continuously the PWV at the VLT. When comparing the AR
forecast at 1h to the standard forecast, we observe a gain factor of ∼ 8 (i.e. ∼ 800 per
cent) in terms of forecast accuracy. In the PWV ≤ 1 mm range, which is extremely
critical for infrared astronomical applications, the RMSE of the predictions is of the
order of just a few hundredth of millimetres (0.04 mm). We proved therefore that
the AR technique provides an important beneﬁt to VLT science operations for all the
instruments sensitive to the PWV. Besides, we show how such an ability in predicting
the PWV can be useful also to predict the sky background in the infrared range
(extremely appealing for METIS). We quantify such an ability by applying this method
to the NEAR project (New Earth in the Alpha Cen region) supported by ESO and
Breakthrough Initiatives.

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantiﬁcation of the water vapour is particularly critical
for ground-based observations in the infrared spectrum (IR,
sub-millimetric and millimetric ranges), since it is one of
the atmospheric constituents that mostly aﬀects the atmo-
sphere transmission at those wavelengths. The transmis-
sion/opacity of the atmosphere is mainly caused by the ab-
sorption of radiation from H2O. On the other side, the wa-
ter vapour is also one of the causes that contributes to the
sky background, due to the re-emission of the absorbed en-
ergy which impacts on the sensitivity of IR observations,
and the strength of the process is dependant on the H2O
abundance in the atmosphere. The vertical distribution of
the water vapour in the atmosphere can be described by

the vertical stratiﬁcation of the mixing ratio M or the ab-
solute humidity AH. For most of the practical astronom-
ical applications, the relevant parameter is the integral of
these quantities along the whole atmosphere, the so called
precipitable water vapour (PWV). The forecast of this pa-
rameter can be therefore extremely useful to optimise the
potentialities and the eﬃciency of instruments running at
these wavelengths. The PWV can be forecasted to support
science operations by using atmospherical models, and sev-
eral studies employing mesoscale models to reconstruct the
PWV can be found in the literature (Cucurull et al. (2000),
Gonzalez et al. (2013), Giordano et al. (2013), Perez-Jordan
et al. (2015, 2018), Pozo et al. (2016)).

In a recent paper (Turchi et al. 2019), the authors used
the non-hydrostatical atmospherical model Meso-Nh to fore-
cast the PWV above Cerro Paranal (Chile), site of the Very
Large Telescope (VLT), on a time scale of a 6 to 15 hours
in the future. More precisely, the forecast of the PWV for
the coming night is provided early in the afternoon of the

day before. A statistical analysis has been performed above
Cerro Paranal, site of the VLT, on a sample of 240 nights
uniformly distributed in diﬀerent years (2013 and 2017) and
statistical operators (bias, RMSE and σ) have been quanti-
ﬁed in diﬀerent ranges: all PWV values, PWV ≤ 5 mm and
PWV ≤ 1 mm. The results of the previous analysis revealed
that the proposed model and the approach were extremely
promising. The smaller is the threshold of the analysed in-
terval, the smaller is the RMSE achieved, up to a value of
RMSE = 0.27 mm in the most challenging region, i.e. when
PWV ≤ 1 mm. This indicates that the proposed approach
seems very eﬃcient to reconstruct the most interesting val-
ues in the astronomical context, i.e. the extremely low values
of the PWV. In the same paper, we proved that the Meso-Nh
model provides a substantial improvement in performances
(roughly a factor 2 i.e. 100 per cent) with respect to the At-
mospheric General Forecast Model of the European Centre
for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).

More recently, a method has been proposed (Masciadri
et al. 2020) aiming to improve the model performances in
forecasting some relevant atmospheric and astroclimatic pa-
rameters on short time scales (order of a few hours in the
future, typically 1h or 2h) using an autoregressive (AR) tech-
nique that simultaneously uses the forecast obtained with an
atmospheric model on longer time scales1 and the real-time
measurement of the speciﬁc forecasted parameter. Such a
method has been successfully tested on the Large Binocu-
lar Telescope (LBT) and it has been implemented in the
ALTA Center, the operational forecast system conceived to
support science operations of this telescope. The time scale
of one hour in the future is the most critical for the queue
modes of top-class telescopes, because this is the time scale
on which decisions are typically taken, either to switch from
a program to another or from an instrument to another.

Results of that study indicate that important gains
in the forecast reliability can be reached using the au-
toregressive approach, even if the gain (between 2.70 and
4.90 in terms of RMSE reduction) depends on the speciﬁc
atmospheric parameter. However, the LBT site has no
real-time measurements of the PWV. We still do not
know, therefore, what might be the gain obtainable in the
prediction of the PWV using this technique. The PVW is
nightly monitored at the VLT with a Low Humidity and
temperature Proﬁling microwave radiometer (LHATPRO).
This instrument has been validated by Kerber et al. (2012)
and it has been engineered for monitoring dry sites.

In this paper we evaluated the impact of this method
on the PWV at the VLT by quantifying the gain obtained
on the prediction accuracy of this parameter with respect
to the standard forecasts (forecast at long time scales) and
also with respect to the persistence method. The persistence
method assumes that the value of a speciﬁc parameter re-
mains equal to the value measured at the present time t0 for
the successive hour. Increasing the forecast accuracy, even
if over short time windows, can deﬁnitely help the ﬂexible
scheduling and the identiﬁcation of the best PWV windows
to optimise infrared observations that critically depend on
this parameter.

Besides, we explore further contexts in which the fore-
cast of the PWV might be critical and crucial. We focused
therefore our attention on the project NEAR (Kasper et
al. 2017), a challenging experiment promoted by ESO and
Breakthrough Initiatives2 that aims to search for exoplanets
in the habitable zone (HZ) around α Centauri in N band.
Earth-type planets, with characteristics similar to our own
planet, typically have orbits within [0.1-1] au of their star
(red dwarf or solar type). Such kind of planets can not be
generally detected from 8-10 m class telescopes, as we need a
contrast of 10−5 - 10−7 in N band for stars within 10 pc from
Earth (10−5 for red dwarfs and 10−7 for solar-type stars),
but they represent an important science case for the ELT.
In the case of the α Centauri star system (α Centauri A and
B), however, because of its proximity (1.35 pc) to Earth,
the angular separation of a potential planet should be of the
order of 1(cid:48)(cid:48)and the observation of a planet in the HZ should
in principle be possible also with a 8 m class telescopes by
pushing to the extreme the possibile contrast and sensitivity
attainable on such tools. The concept of NEAR project im-
plies the modiﬁcation of VISIR instrument, that consists on
combining the instrument with the adaptive optics using the
deformable secondary of UT4, adding a phase mask corono-
graph optimised for N band and including a new chopper
system for noise ﬁltering (Kasper et al. 2017). In the anal-
ysis presented in this contribution, we used all the NEAR
project observations related to the commissioning run on the
23 May - 10 June 2019 period plus the nigh of the 26 June
2019, for a total of 18 nights, and all the data-set related to
the run in shared risk basis to the community for the Science
Veriﬁcation (SV) related to the 13-19 December 2019 run,
for a total of 7 nights.

The wavelength window has been selected between 10
µm and 12.5 µm, where the SNR is supposed to be max-
imum. Preliminary observations done during the commis-
sioning seemed to indicate that the PWV has an impact on
the sky background even if in principle we are in a region
dominated by the telescope emission. The idea is therefore
to analyse the sky background and the PWV and to estab-
lish if we can retrieve any correlation or relation between
the two quantities. This might provide new insights on the
PWV role for the instrumentation for the new generation
class telescopes and eventually help us in identifying other
applications of the PWV forecasts.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we
brieﬂy present the conﬁguration of the numerical model
used in the present study. In Section 3 we discuss the
measurements provided by VLT instrumentation. In Sec-
tion 4 we brieﬂy summarize the principle of autoregression
technique that we used to enhance PWV forecast over
a timescale of 1h. In Section 5 we describe the model
performances obtained using the autoregression technique
and we compare results obtained with the standard forecast
approach and with method by persistence. In Section 6
we quantify the correlation between the sky background
measured with NEAR during the commissioning and the
PWV and we discuss the importance of the PWV forecast in
this context. Finally, in Section 7 we present our conclusions.

2 MODEL CONFIGURATION

The atmospheric model used to forecast the atmosphere is
Meso-NH3 (MNH) (Lafore et al. 1998; Lac et al. 2018). It is
a non-hydrostatic mesoscale model that simulates the time
evolution of a ﬁnite 3D atmospheric volume over a speciﬁc
geographical area. The speciﬁc model conﬁguration was
basically the one reported in (Turchi et al. 2019), thus we
report here just the most relevant elements. We performed
the simulations over Cerro Paranal (VLT site) located
at coordinates (24.62528 S, 70.40222 W) at an height of
2635 m above sea level.

We use a grid-nesting technique (Stein et al. 2000)
that consists of using a set of diﬀerent imbricated domains,
described in Tables 1, with a digital elevation model (DEM,
i.e. orography) extended on smaller and smaller surfaces
having a progressively higher horizontal resolution. In this
way, using the same vertical grid resolution, we achieve
the highest horizontal resolution on the innermost domain
extended on a limited surface around the summit to provide
the best possible prediction. Each domain is centered on
the telescope coordinates.

The DEM used for domains 1 and 2, is the GTOPO4,
with an intrinsic resolution of 1 km. In domain 3 we use a
digital elevation model with an intrinsic resolution of 500 m
(16(cid:48)(cid:48)).
We use the the grid-nesting 2-way option that allows a
mutual interaction between each couple of father and son
domains i.e. each couple of contiguous domains. The 2-way
conﬁguration is known to provide more consistent and
realistic results than the 1-way conﬁguration (Stein et al.
2000; Harris, Durran 2000).
We use 62 vertical levels on each domain, starting from 5 m
above ground level (a.g.l.). The levels have a logarithmic
stretching of 20% up to 3.5 km a.g.l. From this point
onward the model uses an almost constant vertical grid
size of ∼ 600 m up to ∼23 km, which is the top level of
our domain. The grid mesh deforms uniformly to adapt to
the orography, so the actual size of the vertical levels can
stretch in order to accommodate for the diﬀerent ground
level at each horizontal grid point.

In this study we implemented the Turchi et al. (2019)
model set-up in an automatic forecast system in order to
run consecutively over a whole year. The system takes
care of all the phases of the forecast,
from the model
initialisation, the data assimilation and grid conﬁguration,

the parallel simulation and the ﬁnal post-processing phase
and the production of the ﬁnal outputs. The system is
designed in order to guarantee the delivery of the forecasts
early in the afternoon before the start of the observing
night. The forecasts computed in this way will be referred
as ”standard conﬁguration” in the following sections and are
the benchmark over which we will evaluate the performance
of the AR method Masciadri et al. (2020).
The model
is initialised with daily operational forecasts
computed by ECMWF general atmospheric forecast model
extended on the whole globe. Simulations cover the night
time at VLT, which is relevant for astronomical observations
on each site. The date of each simulation in this paper
is identiﬁed by the UT day ”J” in which the night starts.
For the Cerro Paranal case, in this study we simulate 18
hours initializing the model at 18:00 UT of the day ”J”
with ECMWF forecasts computed at 12:00 of the same
day. We force the model each consecutive 6 hours with data
coming from the ECMWF and we treat/analyse results in
the interval [00:00 - 09:00] UT of day ”J+1”. This interval
permits to ﬁt the nighttime during the whole solar year.

Meso-NH computes the PWV using the vertical proﬁles
of water vapor mixing ratio M (kg/kg), pressure P (Pas-
cal) and temperature T (Kelvin degrees), using the following
equation 1.

P W V = −

1
gρH2O

(cid:90) Ptop

P0

M dP

(1)

PWV is expressed in mm. In the above equation ρH2O =
103kg/m3 is the water density and g = 9.81 ms−2 is the
standard gravity acceleration. We integrate between the
ground level pressure P0 and the top level (∼20 km a.g.l)
pressure Ptop. We note that the water vapour scale height
is in the range 1.5-2.5 km. Above the latter height the wa-
ter content decreases drastically and is typically negligible
above 10 km (Querel, Naylor, Kerber 2016).
The PWV value is provided with a time sampling of two min-
utes of simulated time and it is calculated in the innermost
domain having a horizontal resolution of 500 m. Following
results obtained by (Turchi et al. 2019) - Eq.2, we applied
the post-processing correction obtained in statistical terms
aiming to remove systematic errors of the forecast.

3 MEASUREMENTS AND
INSTRUMENTATION

The instrument used as a reference in this paper is the Low
Humidity and Temperature Proﬁling microwave radiometer
(LHATPRO) that has been installed at Cerro Paranal in
2011 (Kerber et al. 2012) and since then runs continuously
24/7 providing measurements stored in the ESO archive5.
This instrument is completely automated and is manufac-
tured by Radiometer Physics GmbH. It uses multiple mi-
crowave channels in the frequency bands of 183 GHz (H2O)
and 51-58 GHz (O2) in order to retrieve, among others, the
humidity and temperature proﬁles up to 10 km of altitude
above the ground level. Measurements are taken on 39 ver-
tical levels with a resolution that varies from 10 m at the

ground level up to 1 km at the topmost height. For more
detailed description see Rose et al. (2005). As explained in
Kerber et al. (2012), the 183 GHz line is extremely impor-
tant because it allows to resolve the extremely low levels of
PWV present on a dry site such as Paranal (median value
is around 2.4 mm).
LHATPRO was validated for astronomical use in 2011 (Ker-
ber et al. 2012) against radiosoundings, showing a good cor-
relation with measurements, an accuracy of 0.1 mm and a
precision of 0.03 mm) for the PWV. The instrument de-
creases its accuracy starting from 15 mm, and starts to sat-
urate for PWV values above 20 mm. These correspond how-
ever to very rare bad weather events at Paranal (typically
below 15 mm). In this study we considered 15 mm as a top
threshold for our analysis.

LHATPRO measures the PWV with a sample rate of
5 s, while Meso-NH samples the PWV every 2 minutes. In
order to have a common time frame, which is fundamental
in the following AR method implementation, we decided to
resample both data-sets over 1 minute timestep, averaging
on the fast LHATRO sample rate and interpolating over the
Meso-NH slower one.

4 AUTOREGRESSIVE METHOD

One of the goals of this paper is to apply the autoregressive
method (Masciadri et al. 2020) to the PWV at the VLT in
order to quantify the gain in forecast accuracy over a short
time window, which is fundamental to help the optimal plan-
ning of observations critically dependent on atmospheric wa-
ter vapour content in ﬂexible scheduling. The details of the
implemented method are reported in (Masciadri et al. 2020)
and here we report a short summary. We deﬁne a function
Xt that depends on the diﬀerence between the standard con-
ﬁguration forecast (M ) and measurements (O) calculated at
time t:

Xt = (Ot − Mt).

(2)

The AR method allows to predict the future value of the
above function through a polynomial equation with P re-
gressor coeﬃcients ai :

Xt+1 =

P
(cid:88)

i=1

ai(Ot−i+1 − Mt−i+1)

(3)

The ai regressors are computed through a least mean square
minimization over a ﬁnite number N of past nights, then the
AR PWV prediction A is obtained as X ∗
t+1 = Mt+1 + Xt+1.
At each time t during the night, all the measurements
for t(cid:48) ≤ t and all the standard conﬁguration predictions until
of the end of the night are available. In order to perform a
prediction over L hours in the future, we advance the time
series X ∗ for one hour in the future, then we update again
the regressor coeﬃcients adding sequentially the AR pre-
dicted values between t and t + 1 hour to the measurements
collected util time t. This is done in order to contain the
AR divergence from the measurements. Then we repeat the
above prediction.
We used the same approach described in Masciadri et al.
(2020) and applied to Mt.Graham, site of the Large Binoc-
ular Telescope i.e. the AR is computed each hour with the
same number of regressors (50) and using the same number

of nights in the past (N=5). As explained in the previous
paper, it has been observed that the gain of the AR with re-
spect to the standard forecast, in terms of RMSE reduction,
is often grater than 1 even after 4 hours in the future. In this
paper, we extended the estimate of the RMSE as a function
of ∆T (the time in the future from any given present time)
up to 6 hours. We only consider nighttime and, for any date
”J”, we do not have standard forecast data before 18 UT;
moreover the method can only run successfully if there is
at least an hour of measurements that overlaps with the
standard prediciton starting from Xt backward, so the AR
forecast cannot start before 19 UT on each day. If the previ-
ous condition is not met, we assume automatically that we
do not have enough data to perform the AR prediction.
Within the previous constraints, we notice the larger is ∆T,
the smaller is the sample on which one can compute the
statistics. In other words the sample on which RMSE is com-
puted at ∆T=1h is richer than that on which is computed
at ∆T=6h6.

To produce the AR forecasts we updated the automatic
system described in section 2 by adding the AR method,
again simulating regular operations, using the real-time
measurements available at VLT. The aforementioned
exercise allowed us to successfully validate the automatic
forecast implementation and obtain a large set of simula-
tions over a whole year at Cerro Paranal.

5 RESULTS

In this section we aim to quantify the performances of
the AR method explained in section 4. The AR method
requires a continuous sample of simulated nights to work
eﬃciently, due to the need of a buﬀer of past nights over
which to compute the autoregressor coeﬃcients. For this
reason we considered a total sample size of 365 nights
between 2018/08/01 and 2019/07/31 (UT). On 10 nights
we couldn’t run the AR method due to missing data, so
the ﬁnal sample size used in the analysis is 355 nights.
We performed the analysis in terms of classical statistical
operators RMSE, σ, bias and scatterplots between measure-
ments and forecasts in both conﬁgurations (standard and
AR) in order to compare the diﬀerent forecast accuracies of
the two methods.

In order to be consistent with previous studies done
on the PWV at Cerro Paranal (Turchi et al. 2019) and the
study carried out with the AR method (Masciadri et al.
2020), we performed a 20 minutes resampling over both
measurements and predictions (standard conﬁguration and
AR) before computing the statistical operators and the scat-
terplots. The main reason behind this is to ﬁlter out the high
frequencies and put in evidence the forecast trend, which
is the most relevant information from the user point of view.

Considering that the median value of PWV over Cerro
Paranal is 2.5 mm, as reported in ﬁgure A1, we divided the
sample into three ranges: the ﬁrst takes into consideration

all PWV values below 15 mm, which accounts for almost
all the PWV values registered over Cerro Paranal and,
as explained in section 3, is the value range in which the
instrument is most accurate; the second range takes into
account all PWV values below 5 mm, which includes the
most common PWV values; the third range considers all
PWV values below 1 mm, which are to be considered
rare extremely low PWV events in which water is almost
absent from the vertical column over the telescope, and
can eﬀectively allow observations practically unobstructed
by water absorption. In the sample analysed in this study
we calculated that this corresponds to 8 per cent of the
total PWV measured values. In Annex A, we repeated
the analysis on the last ﬁve years and we veriﬁed that
the percentage of cases in which the PWV ≤ 1mm is of
order 5 - 10 per cent, therefore the statistics of the sample
analysed in this study is reliable. The relative rarity of
these extremely low PWV clearly shows the beneﬁt of an
accurate model forecast in order to take advantage of low
PWV time windows as soon as they appear. The statisti-
cal analysis was performed over all the three diﬀerent ranges.

In Fig. 1, ﬁrst row, we show the scatterplots obtained
comparing MNH outputs (standard conﬁguration), which
serve as a reference for this study, with measurements
on the three PWV ranges. Statistical indicators are also
reported in Table 2 - top. The results of the same analysis
performed on the AR forecasts extended on 1 hour in the
future is reported in Table 2 - bottom, associated to the
respective gains with respect to the standard forecast (Fig.
1 - bottom) reported in parenthesis. We see, by comparison
with the standard conﬁguration results, that the corre-
lation between the AR prediction and measurements in
signiﬁcantly enhanced. The RMSE is in the range [0.13 -
0.04 mm], which is comparable or even below the accuracy
of the LHATPRO instrument itself (which Kerber et al.
(2012) reported to be ∼0.1 mm7 and is computed with
respect to the measured value.). By looking at Table 2
results show that the AR prediction that we implemented

values, while the forecast accuracy of 0.04 mm is for PWV ≤ 1 mm

provide a considerable gain on a time scale of 1 h with
respect to the standard forecast. The maximum gain is
8.38 and it is 8.25 for the PWV ≤ 1 mm. The ability to
predict the rare extremely low PWV events with negligible
discrepancy from the measured value (0.04 mm RMSE) is
of extremely helpful in observation scheduling at VLT.

Following the same scheme used in (Masciadri et al.
2020) in Fig.2 we report the RMSE obtained by applying
the AR method over diﬀerent forecast time scales, from 1
to 6 hours in the future. The horizontal black line corre-
sponds to the RMSE error obtained with the MNH model
forecast from the day before, while the coloured lines cor-
respond to the AR forecast performed with an increasing
number of past nights used in the AR coeﬃcients compu-
tation (from 1 to 5). As expected, we observe that the AR
forecast accuracy tends to decrease with a longer forecast
timescale in the future, becoming similar to the mesoscale
MNH forecast (standard conﬁguration). The gain factor is
still relevant (still a 30% reduction in the RMSE) up to 3
hours in the future and tends to become negligible after 6
hours. It is interesting to observe that results published in
(Masciadri et al. 2020) relative to other atmospheric param-
eters (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direc-
tion), reported a maximum gain of 4.9, while in this study
we observe a much higher factor of the gain for the PWV
in terms of RMSE reduction (almost double). Of course we
can not state, at present time, if this is due to the diﬀerent
site (Mt. Graham versus Cerro Paranal) or to the nature of
the parameter itself.

For completeness we remember that the scattering plots
related to the standard forecast have been calculated here
only to be able to quantify the gain of the AR method. A
dedicated study on the standard forecast of PWV at VLT
has been performed by Turchi et al. (2019). We refer the
reader to that paper for details. We just observe that results
found here are perfectly consistent. The small diﬀerences in
the statistical operators (bias, RMSE and σ) are due tot
he fact that the samples are not the same. It is important
to note that in the case of Turchi et al. (2019), in order to
analyse the window PWV ≤ 1 mm, the authors enriched the
sample size in the low PWV range by including extra nights
in which a PWV ≤ 1 mm has been observed to get a more
signiﬁcative statistical sample, ﬁnding a RMSE = 0.25 mm.
We can not do the same in this study as we are forced to
select consecutive dates due to the AR method requirements.
The enrichment cannot therefore be replicated in the same
way.

Also, from ﬁgure 2 it is evident that the AR perfor-
mance increases with the number of past nights considered
(N) in the AR coeﬃcient computation even if in a less
important way than what observed in the study performed
at Mt.Graham for other atmospheric parameters Masciadri
et al. (2020). The improvement in performances is absent
on a time scale of 1 hour and becomes very small for N
≥ 3. In applying this method to an operational forecast
setup for Cerro Paranal, we can however use N = 5 as
the computational cost between 3 and 5 nights buﬀer is
not relevant. As expected the mesoscale forecast tends to
be more eﬃcient on longer timescales, and also has the
advantage of being available early in the afternoon for
the telescope planning. This comparison however clearly

explains the need for diﬀerent forecast schemes depending
on the diﬀerent use cases. For the PWV the AR forecast
is advantageous with respect to the standard one on time
scales up to around 6 assuming that the night has already
started.

Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the AR method versus
the method by persistence. The latter forecast method
assumes that, at each full hour as in the AR case, we
can forecast the future values of PWV by considering the
present time PWV value as constant, i.e. assuming that
PWV will not change in the successive 1 to 6 hours. We
observe that the persistence method clearly loses against
the AR method in all conﬁgurations. Moreover, as in the
AR method case, the persistence forecast method decreases
in performances with forecast time (∆T), but it becomes
worse that the standard forecast much before than the AR
method i.e. only after 3-4 hours. This is particularly evident
for the PWV ≤ 1 mm case. In the latter case the perfor-
mance scaling of the persistence method is more irregular
than in the other two cases, however this may be due to the
fact that the statistics over this particular sample is lower
with respect to the other two cases. We conclude therefore
that, even if the forecast by persistence introduces some
improvements in the forecast performances at short time

scale with respect to the standard forecast, the AR method
deﬁnitively provides much better performances (a factor 3
to 2 better) with respect to the method by persistemce.
These results are consistent with what found for other
atmospheric parameters above Mt.Graham (Masciadri et
al. 2020).

To illustrate the capabilities of the AR forecast in cor-
rectly reconstructing the short-time PWV predictions we
report here some practical examples. Fig. 4 shows a few ex-
amples associated to extremely low PWV events. The time
evolution of the AR forecast is reconstructed by joining se-
quentially all the 1-hour forecasts performed at each hour
during the night. In this pictures, we can appreciate that
the standard forecast is already quite close to the obser-
vations but the AR method is able to improve the forecast
accuracy in a not negligible way. The AR prediction helps in
correcting small systematic errors, e.g. 2018/09/21 case, in
situations were the standard forecast correctly predicts the
PWV evolution trends. In other cases, e.g. 2018/11/12 and
2019/06/01, the AR prediction can anticipate rapid drops
of the PWV values, giving a clear advantage in the program
switching of the telescope during the observing night. Specif-
ically in night 2019/06/01, the standard prediction is lagging
behind ∼2 hours with respect to the measurements, and the

Figure 2. RMSE obtained for the AR method with respect to diﬀerent forecast times (∆T) from 1 to 6 hours, and with diﬀerent buﬀer
sizes (diﬀerent colour curves). The black line is the reference RMSE obtained with MESO-NH standard forecasts. The RMSE is computed
over the PWV ≤ 15 mm sample (top-left), on the PWV ≤ 5 mm sample (top-right) and the PWV ≤ 1 mm sample (bottom-centre).

AR is very eﬃcient in correcting this temporal shift. The
most interesting case is the night 2019/05/23, were the AR
forecast was able to reconstruct an extremely rare low PWV
event (PWV = 0.1 mm) lasting for 4 hours which basically
allows for ground observations completely unobstructed by
the atmospheric water.

Fig. 5 show on the contrary some examples in which the
standard forecasts show a larger deviation from the mea-
sured PWV values. In these cases the model may either
present large biases with respect to the measurements, or
be unable to predict events in which the PWV value unex-
pectedly changes due to unpredictable weather ﬂuctuations.
In these situations the AR forecasts also helps in correct-
ing these large discrepancies and recover an accurate fore-
cast and trend reconstruction in an extremely eﬃcient way.
The AR forecast is able indeed to correct the model pre-
diction and reconstruct the evolution of the PWV, even in
presence of large ﬂuctuations were PWV varies by 4-5 mm
in 2-3 hours (e.g. 2019/01/12). This level of performance al-
lows for an extremely accurate observation scheduling which
saves observing time and optimise the throughput of scien-
tiﬁc programs critically dependent on PWV.

Results obtained in this study greatly improve our
ability in reconstructing the PWV in advance with potential
important consequence in terms of the eﬃciency of the
queue mode managing of top-class telescopes such as the
VLT. Such a high level of reliability in the PWV forecast

can be useful for all the instruments of the VLT running
in the IR, sub-millimetric and millimetric ranges. We think
therefore about the VLT Imager and Spectrometer for the
mid-Infrared (VISIR; (Lagage et al. 2004)) which operates
in the (5-20 µm) ranges. At the same time, this can be
useful for a set of other instruments running at shorter
wavelengths (visible or near-infrared) that beneﬁt from a
low value of the PWV, such as CRIRES (Kaeuﬂ et al.
2004), X-SHOOTER (Vernet et al. 2011), MUSE (Henault
et al. 2003) and VLTI GRAVITY (Eisenhauer et al. 2008).

6 NEAR PROJECT: SKY BACKGROUND

We present in this section an application of the PWV fore-
cast to the NEAR IR project which has run at VLT, as
explained in section 1, operating in the 10-12,5 µm wave-
length range. As reported in Kasper et al. (2017) a new
spectral ﬁlter has been implemented in NEAR to maximise
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The selection of the band-
pass is the result of a compromise. From one side it should
be interesting to go towards a wide bandpass to increase the
number of photons collected. On the other side, it should be
preferable to skip-oﬀ some parts of the spectrum. More pre-
cisely, below 10 µm the sky background increases (Kasper
et al. (2017)- Fig.4) and the absorption from ozone O3 di-
minishes the atmospheric transmission. Above 12.5 µm the

absorption from CO2 becomes an important limitation for
the observations. In the context of the NEAR project, there-
fore, the band [10 - 12.5] µm has been selected. In this band
the background is dominated by the telescope emission and
the sensitivity to the other atmospheric conditions is weak,
thus the PWV value is one of the main elements left that
must be accounted for.

We ﬁrst analysed the data-set related to the com-
missioning period to compute the correlation between the
sky background counts and the PWV. Observations have
been done with a angular groove phase mask coronograph
(AGPM) optimised for the N band. The AGPM is a varia-
tion of a vortex coronagraph with very small inner working
angle and high throughput Mawet et al. (2005). We consid-
ered the following technical speciﬁcations: an exposure time
DIT = 6 msec, a ∆λ = 2.5 µm, a pixelscale = 0.045(cid:48)(cid:48), an
eﬃciency = 0.1 (including the instrument transmission and
the telescope reﬂectivity) and a GAIN = 20. To pass from
counts to physical quantities we took into account the bias
of the system of 10 kcts. This led to Fig.6, where blue dots
represent the scattering plot between the sky-background
and the observed PWV. We note that, as expected, the sky-
background in the [10 - 12.5] µm window is coherent with
that shown in Kasper et al. (2017) - Fig.4 in terms of or-
der of magnitude of the emission mainly below 0.5-0.6 ×109
phot s−1 m−2 µm−1 arcsec−2 .

The interesting results is however that it is possible to

observe a general correlation between the sky-background
and the PWV which seems to be valid on a wide range of
PWV values from 0 up to 7 mm. The spikes around PWV =
2 mm might be explained by emission due to some molecular
absorption lines or interaction with dust in the atmosphere
as described in Kasper et al. (2017) - Fig.4. The contribution
to these few peaks around PWV = 2 mm comes from dif-
ferent observations on diﬀerent nights, so it can’t be related
to an isolated case and is therefore probably realistic.

The evidence of a sky background dependency on the
PWV is supported by the fact that the cold Lyot stop blocks
emission from the room temperature telescope environment
(central obscuration, M2 support structures, etc). This only
leaves blackbody radiation from the warm telescope mirrors
and the cryostat entrance window, which should be compa-
rable to the sky emission (see Kasper et al. (2017)). The
point in which the dashed black line intersects the Y-axis
gives an indication of the telescope emission attenuated by
the Lyot stop. The value of intersection with the Y-axis is of
the order of 0.37×109 that is somehow lower than estimated
by Kasper et al. (2017) (∼0.6×109).

After the ﬁrst analysis was completed, we considered
also the data-set of the science veriﬁcation (SV) to en-
rich the statistics, taking care to normalise with respect
to the same observational conditions. During the SV a
diﬀerent Lyot stop has been used with respect to the
commissioning run (NEAR-201 vs NEAR-101) permitting

a larger throughput for signal and sky-background (93
per cent instead of 75 per cent). Emission has therefore
to be corrected by a 75/93 factor to be compared with
the commissioning data set. The red squares in Fig. 6
show results obtained with the SV data-set. We can see
that results with bot data-sets are quite consistent, the
general correlation between the emission and the PWV is
conﬁrmed and the regression line is only slightly changed
by the addition of SV data. Speciﬁcally the coeﬃcients of
the y = ax + b regression line change from [a = 3.10 × 107,
b = 3.73 × 108], obtained with the commissioning data only,
and [a = 3.18 × 107, b = 3.72 × 108], obtained on the whole
dataset. We also veriﬁed that the NEAR data is consistent
with the sky background increase with PWV predicted
by ESO’s SKYCALC tool8. The crosses in Fig. 6 show
the predicted values assuming the total mirror and warm

side of the cryostat emissivity of 7% and an instrument
transmission of 50%.

The important conclusion is therefore that, the knowl-
edge in advance of the PWV can provide an indirect infor-
mation of the sky-background regimes, allowing the identi-
ﬁcation of the conditions with the optimal sky background
for the most challenging observations. As we have shown in
this paper, the PVW can be quantiﬁed in a very accurate
way on a time scale of few hours, thus our results indicate
that it is indeed possible to predict the order of magnitude
of the sky-background.

At the same time, this analysis puts in evidence that
the correlation between the sky background and the PVW
seems to be an important element to take into account in the
design and realisation of METIS9, a prime focus instrument

study.

7 CONCLUSIONS

In this study we aim to improve PWV forecasts at short
time scales using a method recently proposed for this goal
and to be applied at atmospheric and astroclimatic param-
eters (Masciadri et al. 2020). The goal of the study is to
analyse the impact of this strategy on the PWV at Cerro
Paranal, site of the VLT, and in particular the implica-
tions in terms of science operations. This method is based
on an auto-regressive technique. It makes use of the fore-
casts extended on a long time scale, performed in our case
with a mesoscale model (we call this ’standard forecast’) and
computed in advance, and the real-time measurements ob-
tained by the telescope instrumentation. In this paper we
have shown that this method signiﬁcantly increases the ac-
curacy of the PWV forecasts by a factor that can be as high
as ∼8.38 on a time scale of 1h. This means a gain of ∼800 per
cent. Results obtained above Mt.Graham analysing other at-
mospheric parameters and seeing revealed consistent gains

More precisely, we proved that, in the extremely low
PWV regimes (PWV ≤ 1 mm) which are the most interest-
ing for ground based IR astronomy, the forecast accuracy of
our method achieves a negligible error (RMSE ∼ 0.04 mm)
with respect to the measurements, for forecasts at a time
scale of 1 hour. The RMSE is only slightly larger (The gain
decreases in intensity if we consider larger time scales (2h,
3h, etc) but it remains still advantageous with respect to
the standard forecast up to around 6 hours in the future.
We also proved that the method revealed to be much more
performant than the forecast by persistence that takes into
account only real-time measurements. Accuracies are still
extremely good for diﬀerent PWV categories. For PWV ≤
15 mm we obtain a RMSE = 0.13 mm For PWV ≤ 5 mm
we obtain a RMSE = 0.08 mm. By knowing that the accu-
racy of the measurements is 0.1 mm we can conclude that
we basically achieved at least the limit of the instrumental
accuracy with forecasts at 1h time scale for all the cases:
PWV ≤ 15 mm, PWV ≤ 5 mm and PWV ≤ 1 mm.

The standard forecast is still essential to long-term plan-
ning. Also it plays of course a role in the accuracy of the AR

method. We implemented such a method in an automatic
tool in order to assess the reliability for a potential oper-
ational support of VLT observations10. Results obtained in
this study clearly indicate that such a kind of system can def-
initely play an important role in VLT observations schedul-
ing and improve scientiﬁc throughput of critical IR observa-
tional campaigns.

Besides that, we tested our system during the NEAR
project commissioning and Science Veriﬁcation and we dis-
cussed a potential further application of the PWV forecast.
This has been done using NEAR project commissioning and
Science Veriﬁcation data-set related to a total sample of 25
nights. We found that the PWV values are directly corre-
lated to the sky background IR emission in the [10-12.5]
µm wavelength window in which the NEAR project runs,
which is the optimal window in which molecular absorption
from other atmospheric constituents is minimal. This evi-
dence tells us that the knowledge in advance of the PWV
can be considered an indirect estimate of the sky background
and this might open to further applications of the PWV fore-
casts. Of course it should be nice to conﬁrm these results
with a richer statistical sample.

The ability to accurately predict the PWV, and thus to
have an indirect prediction of the sky background emission,
could have a positive impact on IR observations and on the
exploitation of the next-generation ELT IR instruments such
as METIS.

APPENDIX A: CERRO PARANAL
CLIMATOLOGY

We report here the cumulative distributions of PWV ob-
tained on the 355 nights sample from 2018/2019 used in
the present study (ﬁg. A1, red line). This is coherent with
the statistics published in (Turchi et al. 2019) that treated
data in the years 2013 and 2017. For the sake of complete-
ness we also report the cumulative distribution of the PWV
values on Cerro Paranal from 2015/04/28, which is the ear-
liest LHATPRO measurement available in ESO database, to
2019/12/31 (ﬁg. A1, black line). We observe that the chosen
sample for this study is quite representative of the whole
global sample. In ﬁg. A2 we report the evolution of the per-
centage of time at Paranal characterised by extremely low
PWV values ≤ 1 mm, with respect to the total PWV ob-
servations in each year between 2015 and 2019. While the
number of years monitored by LHATPRO is still low for a
proper climatological analysis, it is enough to conclude that
we can expect a percentage of extremely low PWV events
in the range 5-10% of the total time each year.
