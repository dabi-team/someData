We have experimentally determined the production rate of 39Ar and 37Ar from cosmic ray
neutron interactions in argon at sea level. Understanding these production rates is important for
argon-based dark matter experiments that plan to utilize argon extracted from deep underground
because it is imperative to know what the ingrowth of 39Ar will be during the production, transport,
and storage of the underground argon. These measurements also allow for the prediction of
39Ar and 37Ar concentrations in the atmosphere which can be used to determine the presence
of other sources of these isotopes. Through controlled irradiation with a neutron beam that
mimics the cosmic ray neutron spectrum, followed by direct counting of 39Ar and 37Ar decays
with sensitive ultra-low background proportional counters, we determined that the production
rate from cosmic ray neutrons at sea-level is expected to be (759 ± 128) atoms/(kgAr day) for
39Ar, and (51.0 ± 7.4) atoms/(kgAr day) for 37Ar. We also performed a survey of the alternate
production mechanisms based on the state-of-knowledge of
the associated cross-sections to
obtain a total sea-level cosmic ray production rate of (1048 ± 133) atoms/(kgAr day) for 39Ar,
(56.7 ± 7.5) atoms/(kgAr day) for 37Ar in underground argon, and (92 ± 13) atoms/(kgAr day) for
37Ar in atmospheric argon.

INTRODUCTION

Isotope

Abundance

Argon is a widely used medium for the detection
of ionizing radiation.
It has a high scintillation and
ionization yield, allows for the propagation of scintil-
lation photons and ionization electrons over large dis-
tances, and can be easily puriﬁed to remove non-noble
impurities. Argon is therefore employed as the active
medium for large neutrino detectors [1, 2], scintillation
vetos [3], and direct-detection dark matter experiments
[4–6]. Argon is particularly attractive for dark matter
detectors as the time proﬁle of the scintillation light
enables pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) of signal-like
nuclear recoils from radiogenic electron recoils.

Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth’s
atmosphere, comprising roughly 0.93% of the atmo-
sphere by volume. Argon extracted from the atmo-
sphere consists primarily of the stable isotopes 40Ar,
36Ar, and 38Ar. However, due to interactions of cosmic
rays, atmospheric argon also contains three long-lived
radioactive isotopes: 39Ar, 37Ar, and 42Ar. The abun-
dances and speciﬁc activity of the different isotopes in
the atmosphere are given in Table I. In this paper we
will focus on the two radioisotopes that, due to their
high speciﬁc activity, are most relevant for argon-based
dark matter experiments: 37Ar and 39Ar.

39Ar is a pure β-emitter with an end-point of 565 keV
and a half-life of 268 years [13]. For large or low back-
ground argon-based detectors 39Ar is often the domi-
nant source of interactions at low energies. The β de-

cays of 39Ar limit the sensitivity to rare events and can
also create difﬁculties through signal pileup and high
data acquisition rates.
In dark matter detectors PSD
is extremely effective at reducing the 39Ar background
at high energies, but at low energies the discrimina-
tion power is limited by the detected photon statistics
and the energy threshold is often determined by the
39Ar rate [6, 14].

To mitigate the effects of 39Ar, the next generation of
argon-based dark matter detectors propose to use argon
extracted from deep underground. The DarkSide-50
collaboration has demonstrated that underground ar-
gon (UAr) they are using as their dark matter target has
an 39Ar rate of 7.3 × 10−4 Bq/kgAr [15], a factor ≈ 1400
below atmospheric levels. The use of UAr rather than
atmospheric argon (AAr) has allowed for a reduction
in energy threshold and increase in nuclear recoil ac-
ceptance while maintaining a background-free WIMP
dark matter search [5, 15]. Additionally, the use of low
radioactivity UAr is critical for low-mass dark matter
searches which extend to lower energy thresholds than
the standard WIMP search [16]. The need for argon

The cosmogenic production of both 37Ar and 39Ar in
argon is expected to be dominated by neutron-induced
reactions but there are no existing measurements of
the total production cross-section or integrated cosmo-
genic production rate. Estimates for dark matter ex-
periments have therefore had to rely on semi-empirical
calculations, which as we show, signiﬁcantly underes-
timate the production rates. In this paper we describe
a measurement of the integrated production rate from
a neutron beam at the Los Alamos Neutron Science
Center (LANSCE) ICE HOUSE facility [22, 23] which
has a very similar energy spectrum to that of cosmic
ray neutrons at sea-level (see Figure 1). While the
spectral shape is similar, the neutron beam has a ﬂux
that is ≈ 4.5 × 108 times higher above 10 MeV, which
allows for the production of measurable amounts of
39Ar in short periods of time. We irradiated samples
of underground and atmospheric argon for 3 days on
the neutron beam and then measured the resulting ac-
tivity in ultra-low background gas proportional coun-
ters (ULBPC) at Paciﬁc Northwest National Laboratory
(PNNL). The ULBPCs are custom-built to detect low
levels of 39Ar and 37Ar in gas samples for the purpose
of radiometric dating and support of future nuclear test
ban treaty monitoring [24], with a sensitivity to 39Ar at
the level of 2.5 × 10−2 Bq/kgAr [25, 26] and to 37Ar at
the level of 4.3 × 10−3 Bq/kgAr [19, 26]. The high in-
tensity of the LANSCE neutron beam and the sensitiv-
ity of the ULBPC detectors allow us to experimentally
measure the 39Ar and 37Ar production rate and extrap-
olate them to estimate the sea-level cosmogenic neutron
production rate.

39Ar PRODUCTION MECHANISMS

The production of 39Ar in the atmosphere is primar-
ily due to cosmic rays. While several of the production
channels do not have measured cross-sections, based
on the known ﬂux of the various cosmogenic particles
and the general behavior of cross-sections for similar
isotopes, it is estimated that interactions with fast neu-
trons account for more than 94% of the total 39Ar pro-
duction in the atmosphere [7]. There are two1 pri-
mary fast neutron reactions that result in the produc-
tion of 39Ar: 40Ar(n, 2n)39Ar and 40Ar[(n, np) + (n, pn)
+ (n, d)]39Cl.
In the latter case, which we will hence-
forth abbreviate to 40Ar(n, d)39Cl, the short-lived 39Cl
decays to 39Ar through β decay with a 55.6 minute half-
life. Since 39Ar is a pure β emitter it is not possible to
directly measure the total production cross-section by

1 The neutron-induced production of 39S, which sequentially decays
to 39Cl and 39Ar, is estimated to be 4 orders of magnitude smaller
than the direct 39Ar production. For other possible production
mechanisms see Section VII.

FIG. 1. Comparison of the LANSCE 4FP30R neutron beam
with sea-level cosmic ray neutrons. The black data points and

the ﬁssion chamber during the 3-day beam exposure used for
this measurement. The red continuous line and the right verti-
cal axis show the reference cosmic ray neutron ﬂux at sea-level

with low-levels of 39Ar grows as future dark matter ex-
periments move towards tonne-scale target masses and
beyond. The relative background contributions of ra-
dioactive contaminants in external components will de-
crease due to self-shielding of the argon and a decreas-
ing surface-to-volume ratio, making 39Ar (which scales
with the target mass) the likely dominant background.

Similar to the commercial production of argon from
the atmosphere, UAr must be extracted from crude nat-
In the case of
urally occurring gases underground.
the DarkSide-50 experiment this crude gas is primar-
ily CO2, extracted from a gas well in Cortez, Colorado,
USA [17]. The processing, transport, and storage of the
UAr on the surface of the Earth exposes the UAr to cos-
mic rays until it can be suitably shielded underground.
Given the extremely stringent requirements on the lev-
els of 39Ar for dark matter detectors, cosmogenic pro-
duction of 39Ar in the UAr is an important concern.

37Ar decays purely through electron capture, produc-
ing low energy x-rays and Auger electrons, with a rela-
tively short half-life of 35.01 days [18]. Since low back-
ground experiments are typically operated deep under-
ground, shielded from cosmic rays, the 37Ar activity
typically decays below measurable levels within a few
months, though the x-ray peak can be used as a low
energy calibration source during early data-taking [16].
37Ar can also be produced by underground nuclear ex-
plosions through neutron reactions with calcium in the
soil [19]. Elevated rates of 37Ar in the environment are
a strong indicator of a nuclear explosion and can there-
fore be used to verify compliance with nuclear test ban
treaties. Thus the natural cosmogenic production of
37Ar in the atmosphere and surface soil gas acts as a
background to underground nuclear monitoring [20].

conventional methods that rely on γ-ray detectors to tag
the reaction products. The only existing measurements
are of the partial cross-sections 40Ar(n, 2nγ)39Ar to ex-
cited states of 39Ar [27] and of 40Ar(n, d)39Cl through
the detection of gamma rays from the 39Cl decay [28–
31].

Estimates of the cosmogenic activation rates have
therefore had to rely on either semi-empirical calcula-
tions such as the Silberberg and Tsao equations [32–
37] that are employed by codes such as YIELDX [38],
COSMO [39], and ACTIVIA [40], Monte Carlo simu-
lations of the hadronic interactions between nucleons
and nuclei that are performed by codes such as INCL
[41], ABLA [42], TALYS [43], etc., or compiled databases
that combine calculations with experimental data such
as ENDF [44], MENDL-2P [45], and TENDL [46]. The
39Ar production cross-section estimates from some of
these different methods2, along with the experimen-
tally measured partial cross-sections, are shown in Fig-
ure 2.
It can be seen that the estimates vary by up
to an order of magnitude at certain energies, yielding
similar sized variation in the predicted 39Ar produc-
tion rate. It should be noted that previous estimates of
the cosmogenic activation rate of underground argon
[50] have used the Silberberg and Tsao semi-empirical
calculations as implemented in the COSMO and AC-
TIVIA codes, which have the lowest predicted cross-
sections and are signiﬁcantly below the experimentally
measured partial cross-sections.

2 The Silberberg and Tsao, and MENDL-2P cross-sections were ob-
tained from the ACTIVIA code package [47], the INCLXX cross-
sections were calculated using the INCL++ code (v6.0.1) with the
ABLA07 de-excitation model [48], and the TALYS cross-sections
calculated using TALYS-1.9 [49]. The default parameters were used
for all programs.

37Ar PRODUCTION MECHANISMS

The production of 37Ar in the atmosphere is also
dominated by neutron interactions on argon. Previ-
ous calculations [51] estimate that 93% of the total
production in the troposphere is due to fast neutrons
through 40Ar(n, 4n)37Ar, with the remaining fraction3
due to the capture of thermal and epithermal neu-
trons through 36Ar(n, γ)37Ar. The only detectable sig-
nal from 37Ar decays are the low-energy x-rays and
Auger electrons following the electron capture, and
thus the 40Ar(n, 4n)37Ar production cross-section can-
not be measured with γ-ray detectors. To our knowl-
edge there are no known experimental measurements
of this cross-section.
Examples of estimates from
semi-empirical calculations, simulations, and evaluated

uation of the neutron beam as well as activation of
the cylinder material. The end caps of the cylinder,
through which the neutron beam passed, had a thinned
(1.5 ± 0.1) mm-thick central wall and were welded onto
the cylindrical section. The gas was ﬁlled and emptied
through a single 6.35 mm diameter double-valved tube
on each cylinder and the cylinders were evacuated to
≈ 1 × 10−6 bar before being ﬁlled with the argon gas
sample.

The samples were irradiated at the LANSCE WNR
ICE-HOUSE II facility [23] on Target 4 Flight Path 30
Right (4FP30R). A broad-spectrum (0.2–800 MeV) neu-
tron beam was produced via spallation of 800 MeV
protons on a tungsten target. A 50.8 mm (2”) diam-
eter beam collimator was used to restrict the major-
ity of the neutrons to within the diameter of the gas
cylinder. The neutron ﬂuence was measured with 238U
foils by an in-beam ﬁssion chamber [54] placed down-
stream of the collimator. The beam has a pulsed time
structure which allows the incident neutron energies to
be determined using a time-of-ﬂight (TOF) measure-
ment between the proton beam pulse and the ﬁssion
chamber signals [22, 54]. As shown in Figure 4, the
three gas cylinders were placed end-to-end with the
two UAr cylinders (I and II) closest to the ﬁssion cham-
ber and AAr cylinder III furthest away. The closest end
of the UAr cylinder I was located 791 mm downstream
from the ﬁssion chamber.

The beam exposure took place over three days be-
tween 11th-14th December 2017. The ﬂuence measured
by the ﬁssion chamber is shown in Figure 1, with a to-
tal of (1.03 ± 0.05) × 1013 neutrons above 10 MeV. The
uncertainty is dominated by the systematic uncertainty
in the 238U(n, f) cross-section which varies from 2%
to 5% below 200 MeV [55] (which includes most of
the production range) and we have conservatively as-
sumed 5% across the whole spectrum. The uncertainty
in the neutron energy spectrum due to the timing un-
certainty in the TOF measurement (1.2 ns) is negligi-
ble for this measurement. While the nominal beam di-
ameter was set by the 2” collimator, the cross-sectional
beam proﬁle has signiﬁcant tails at larger radii, with
roughly 10% falling outside the 3” diameter of the gas
cylinders. Additionally the beam is slightly diverging,
with an estimated cone opening angle of 0.233◦. A
Geant4 [56, 57] simulation that included the measured
beam proﬁle and beam divergence, the measured neu-
tron spectrum, and the full geometry and materials of
the gas cylinder, was used to calculate the neutron ﬂu-
ence through each cylinder. The estimated reduction
factor of the neutron ﬂuence through UAr cylinder II
in the 10-200 MeV range, compared to the ﬂuence mea-
sured by the ﬁssion chamber, is 0.876 ± 0.028, where the
uncertainty includes the uncertainty in the beam proﬁle
and a ± 0.25” uncertainty in the alignment of the beam
center with the cylinder axes.

Following the irradiation the cylinders were stored
for a cool-down period of roughly a month before they

duction cross-sections, these estimates can vary by up
to an order of magnitude.

IV. EXPERIMENT

Three samples of argon gas were prepared for ir-
two UAr samples and one AAr sample.
radiation,
The UAr samples were taken from the same source
of gas that was used in the DarkSide-50 experiment
and the AAr sample was commercial ultra high pu-
rity (99.999%) grade argon obtained from Oxarc. An
AAr sample was used in addition to the UAr samples
to investigate if the different isotopic composition of
the gases would lead to signiﬁcantly different 39Ar and
37Ar production. In addition to 40Ar, AAr contains 36Ar
at 0.334% and 38Ar at 0.063% [12, 52]. UAr is composed
almost solely of 40Ar with the 36Ar concentration mea-
sured by mass spectrometry to be less than 0.01% and
the 38Ar concentration expected to be reduced by a sim-
ilar factor compared to AAr, consistent with measure-
ments of gas extracted from deep underground wells
[7]. For the sake of clarity, all numbers and uncertain-
ties related to the gas samples in the main body of this
paper refer to one of the UAr samples (cylinder II). The
corresponding numbers for the AAr sample (cylinder
III) are included in Table II, while the other UAr sample
(cylinder I) was kept as contingency and not measured.
The gas samples were ﬁlled at 1.12 bar and 296 K
in three identical aluminum cylinders, each with an
interior volume of 1.96 L (calculated through cali-
brated volume-ratio measurements), corresponding to
(3.60 ± 0.08) g of gas, where the uncertainty includes
the uncertainties in pressure, temperature, and volume.
The custom-designed cylinders had a nominal 76.2 mm
(3”) internal diameter and 439 mm internal length and
were fabricated from aluminum to minimize the atten-

were shipped to PNNL for counting. The measured
pressure of the argon in the irradiated cylinders upon
return to PNNL matched the initial ﬁll pressures within
uncertainties, indicating that no argon had leaked out
during the transportation or irradiation. Activation cal-
culations indicated that along with 39Ar and 37Ar, sev-
eral other long-lived radioisotopes would also be pro-
duced by the irradiation, most notably 32P, 33P, 35S,
22Na, 3H, and 7Be. However previous experiments in-
volving the irradiation of argon [58, 59] found that acti-
vation products remain in the irradiation canister when
argon is transferred out.
Since tritium is especially
dangerous as it can introduce a long-lived radioactive
background into the ULBPC, the argon gas was cryop-
umped through a hydrogen getter into a smaller cylin-
der for loading into the ULBPC. The irradiated gas was
then mixed with 10% methane to form P-10 count gas.

A sample of the P-10 gas mixture from UAr cylinder
II was loaded into the 100.5 cm3 ULBPC at 6.44 bar and
295 K, corresponding to an argon mass of 1.07 g. The
irradiated UAr gas was counted for 31.8 days at low
gain to measure the 39Ar spectrum from 15–400 keV
and was also counted at high gain from 0–15 keV for
3.91 days to measure the 3 keV 37Ar peak.

The 39Ar detection efﬁciency of the ULBPC detec-
tor was calibrated with a 62.6 mBq 39Ar source [53],
and a 15.6 day background run was also acquired. As
shown in Figure 5, the extremely good agreement in
spectral shape between the efﬁciency spectrum and the
data indicate that no other β-decaying activation prod-
ucts were present in the gas sample. After subtracting
the measured background spectrum and accounting for
the calibrated detection efﬁciency of 0.688 ± 0.003, the
measured 39Ar activity in the ULBPC was found to be
(46.1 ± 0.5) mBq.

For 37Ar, the spectrum was ﬁt with a Gaussian to
represent the ≈ 2.8 keV Auger electrons and x-rays
following a K-shell electron capture and an exponen-
tial decay for the underlying 39Ar spectrum (shown
in Figure 6). The branching ratio for the K-shell elec-
tron capture is (90.2 ± 0.2) % [18, 60] and the combined
ULBPC ﬁducial volume efﬁciency for both Auger elec-
trons and x-rays is 0.79 ± 0.02 [61]. Including systematic
uncertainties from the choice of ﬁt range and response
function we obtained a total measured 37Ar activity in
the ULBPC of (216 ± 7) mBq, scaled to the start of the
counting time (accounting for the decay of 37Ar during
the measurement period).

Scaling these activities by the fraction of the total ir-
radiated gas measured and the radioactive decay be-
tween the start of the irradiation and the measurement,
we found an 39Ar activity of (155 ± 4) mBq and an
37Ar activity of (26.0 ± 1.0) Bq for all the gas in the irra-
diated UAr cylinder II. Following the same procedure
described above, for the gas from AAr cylinder III we
found an 39Ar activity of (150 ± 4) mBq and an 37Ar ac-
tivity of (25.3 ± 1.0) Bq.

One must also account for the cosmogenic 39Ar and
37Ar activity that is present in the samples even without
the beam irradiation. Atmospheric argon was found to
contain a speciﬁc activity of (1.01 ± 0.08) Bq/kgAr [8]
of 39Ar, corresponding to an activity of (3.7 ± 0.3) mBq
in AAr cylinder III, which must be subtracted from
the measured activity when calculating the beam
activation rate.
The UAr sample was obtained
from the same source of gas used by DarkSide-50
that was found to have an 39Ar speciﬁc activity of
(0.73 ± 0.11) mBq/kgAr. Compared to the DarkSide-
50 target which was transported deep underground in
February 2015, our UAr samples spent approximately

1170 additional days on the surface, exposed to cosmic-
rays. Even assuming the highest considered cross-
section, the total pre-existing rate of 39Ar in the irra-
diated gas sample is roughly 4.3 µBq, negligible com-
pared to the measured activity.

For the short-lived 37Ar, both samples will have
reached equilibrium activity from cosmogenic produc-
tion at sea-level. Measurements of the 37Ar activity in
the low troposphere (excluding variations due to in-
ﬂows of stratospheric air, outgassing of soil air, and
emissions from nuclear installations) indicate an equi-
librium value of 0.5–1.0 mBq/m3 air (30–60 mBq/kgAr)
[9]. The equilibrium rate at sea-level is expected to
be signiﬁcantly lower than the rate averaged over the
troposphere (in Section VII we estimate it to be (0.7–
1.1 mBq/kgAr)), but we conservatively use the averaged
tropospheric value as an upper limit, corresponding to
total activity of (1.6 ± 0.5) × 10−4 Bq, which is in any
case negligible compared to the measured activity.

The ﬁnal estimates for the beam-induced activity in
the UAr [AAr] sample at the end of the irradiation
are (155 ± 4) mBq [(147 ± 4) mBq] 39Ar and (26 ± 1) Bq
[(25 ± 1) Bq] 37Ar. The speciﬁc input values used as
well as the included statistical and systematic uncer-
tainties are listed in Table II. To compare the results
between the UAr and AAr samples we can divide the
measured activity by the total number of neutrons and
target 40Ar atoms to obtain a beam-averaged cross-
section (listed in Table II). The ratio of the UAr to
AAr beam-averaged cross-section, after eliminating
common systematic uncertainties, is 1.029 ± 0.055 and
1.002 ± 0.052 for 39Ar and 37Ar respectively. The good
agreement between the irradiated UAr and AAr activi-

ties indicate that, as expected, there was no appreciable
contribution from neutron interactions with the small
fractions of naturally occurring 36Ar and 38Ar isotopes
present in the AAr sample. The agreement also veriﬁes
the accuracy of the simulations of the beam attenuation
between the targets and the independent ULBPC activ-
ity measurements.

V. CROSS-SECTIONS

If the neutron beam had an energy spectrum identical
to that of the cosmic ray neutron ﬂux we could simply
estimate the cosmogenic production rate by scaling the
measured activity by the ratio of the cosmic-ray neu-
trons to that of the neutron beam. However the beam
spectrum falls off faster at higher energies than that of
cosmic rays (see Figure 1). Thus we must rely on a
model for the production cross-sections to extrapolate
from the beam measurement to the cosmogenic produc-
tion rate.

We can evaluate the accuracy of the different cross-
section models by comparing the predicted 39Ar and
37Ar production rates from the LANSCE neutron beam
irradiation to the measured rates. The number of iso-
topes atoms N(t) at a given time t is governed by the
equation

where na is the areal number density of the target argon
atoms [atoms/cm2] and S(E, t) is the energy spectrum
of neutrons [neutrons/(MeV sec)]. The second column
of Table III shows the calculated values for the different
39Ar cross-section models considered, with the corre-
sponding numbers for 37Ar shown in Table IV. We note
that not all the cross-section models considered span
the entire range of neutron energies. The TENDL 2015
and MENDL-2P cross-sections are only reported up to
200 MeV, while the TALYS cross-sections have been ex-
tended up to 1 GeV [62]. The INCL++ model can han-
dle neutron-induced reactions up to 15-20 GeV, while
the Silberberg & Tsao semi-empirical cross-section cal-
culations implemented in ACTIVIA can be performed
at any energy, though the cross-sections are assumed to
be independent of energy above ≈ 3 GeV.

From the ratio of the experimentally measured val-
ues to the predictions (shown in the third column of
Table III and IV) it can be seen that the TENDL-2015,
TALYS, and INCL++ models all predict 39Ar activities
within 10% of the measured LANSCE activation value.

However, the Silberberg and Tsao cross-section model
used as the default by the ACTIVIA and COSMO codes,
and previously used to estimate the cosmogenic pro-
duction rate for argon dark matter experiments [50],
predict values more than a factor of 4 smaller than
the experimental measurement. The predictions for
the 37Ar production vary from the experimental mea-
surements by roughly a factor three in both directions,
with the TALYS and INCL++ models accurate to within
about 50%.

If we assume that the shape of the cross-section
model as a function of energy is correct, the ratio of the
experimentally measured activity to the predicted ac-
tivity represents the normalization factor that will need
to be applied to each model to best match the experi-
mental data. In the next section we will use this ratio to
estimate the 37Ar and 39Ar production rates from cos-
mic ray neutrons.

VI. PRODUCTION RATES FROM FAST COSMIC RAY
NEUTRONS

There have been several measurements and calcula-
[63–65]).
tions of the cosmic ray neutron ﬂux (for eg.
The intensity of the neutron ﬂux varies with altitude,
location in the geomagnetic ﬁeld, and solar magnetic
activity (though the spectral shape does not vary as sig-
niﬁcantly) and correction factors must be applied to cal-
culate the appropriate ﬂux [66]. The most commonly
used reference spectrum for sea-level cosmic ray neu-
trons is the so-called ”Gordon” spectrum [21] (shown
in Figure 1), which is based on measurements at ﬁve

different sites in the United States, scaled to sea-level
at the location of New York City during the mid-point
of solar modulation. We have used the parameteriza-
tion given in [21] which agrees with the data to within
a few percent. The spectrum uncertainties at high ener-
gies are dominated by uncertainties in the spectrometer
detector response function (< 4% below 10 MeV and
10-15% above 150 MeV) and we have assigned an aver-
age uncertainty of 12.5%.

The production rate per unit

target mass P(cid:48)
[atoms/(kgAr sec)] of isotopes from the interaction of
cosmic ray neutrons can be written as

8

the production of 37Ar in the troposphere [51]. How-
ever, at the Earth’s surface the ratio of the fast neutron
ﬂux compared to other cosmogenic particles is signiﬁ-
cantly different due to different attenuation lengths in
the atmosphere and the relative contributions must be
re-evaluated. In the following two sub-sections we de-
scribe the methods we used to estimate the individual
contributions using existing measurements and models.

A. Alternate 39Ar Production Mechanisms

(cid:90)

P(cid:48) = n

Φ(E) · σ(E) dE

40Ar(µ, n)39Cl

where n is the number of
target atoms per kilo-
gram of argon and Φ(E) is the cosmic neutron ﬂux
[neutrons/(cm2 sec MeV)]. The integral is evaluated
from 1 MeV to 10 GeV.

The predicted production rate per unit target mass
for the cross-section models considered is shown in the
fourth column of Table III and Table IV for 39Ar and
37Ar respectively. Scaling these values by the ratio of
the experimental to predicted activities for the LAN-
SCE neutron beam, we obtain our best estimates for the
cosmic neutron induced production rates per unit tar-
get mass, shown in the ﬁnal columns. The spread in the
values for the different cross-sections is an indication
of the systematic uncertainty in the extrapolation from
the LANSCE beam measurement to the cosmic neutron
spectrum. If either the LANSCE neutron beam spectral
shape was the same as that of the cosmic ray neutrons,
or the cross-section models all agreed in shape, the
central values in the ﬁnal column would be identical.
The estimated activation rate from cosmic ray neutrons
(759 ± 56exp ± 65cs ± 95n f ) atoms(39Ar)/(kgAr day)
is
and (51.0 ± 3.8exp ± 0.6cs ± 6.4n f ) atoms(37Ar)/(kgAr day),
where the ﬁrst uncertainty listed is due to experimental
measurement uncertainties (represented by the average
uncertainty on the ratio of the measured to predicted
activity from the LANSCE beam irradiation for a
speciﬁc cross-section model), the second is due to the
uncertainty in the shape of the cross-section models
(calculated as the standard deviation of the scaled
cosmogenic production rates by the different models),
and the third is due to the uncertainty in the sea-level
cosmic neutron ﬂux.

VII. ALTERNATE PRODUCTION MECHANISMS

In addition to activity induced by fast neutrons, in-
teractions of gamma-rays, muons, protons, and thermal
neutrons also contribute to the total production rate of
39Ar and 37Ar. Previous calculations estimated that in-
teractions of fast neutrons account for 94% of the to-
tal 39Ar production in the atmosphere [7] and 93% of

The production rate from muon captures at sea-level,

Pµ0, can be estimated by

Pµ0 = R0 ·

λc(40Ar)
λd + λc(40Ar)

· f ∗(39Cl)

(5)

where R0 = (484 ± 71) µ−/(kgAr day) is the rate of
stopped muons at sea-level [73] and we have added a
10% uncertainty to account for the 10% difference in
the (Z/A) value for argon compared to air, λc(40Ar)
= (1.20 ± 0.08) × 106/sec is the capture rate of muons
on argon [74], λd = 4.552 × 105/sec is the decay rate of
muons [75], and f ∗(39Cl) = 0.490 ± 0.014 is the effective
probability of producing 39Cl or 39S [76, 77]. The sea-
level production rate from muon captures is therefore
estimated to be (172 ± 26) atoms/(kgAr day).

40Ar(γ, n)39Ar and 40Ar(γ, p)39Cl

The ﬂux of high energy γ rays at the Earth’s sur-
face was obtained using the PARMA analytical model
[78] as implemented in the EXPACS software program
[67]. Similar to the neutron spectrum, we used New
York city as our reference location for the γ spectrum,
which is shown in Figure 7. We veriﬁed that the γ ﬂux
predicted by the model agreed with experimental mea-
surements [79] to within 20% in the energy range of
interest (10-30 MeV), which we used as our estimate
of the systematic uncertainty. Experimental measure-
ments of the 40Ar(γ, n)39Ar cross-section [80–82] and
the 40Ar(γ, p)39Cl cross-section [80, 82] are shown in
Figure 8. Where multiple measurements exist we have
used the mean and sample standard deviation of the
calculated production rates as our estimates of the cen-
tral value and uncertainty. The estimates for the indi-
vidual processes are shown in Table V with the total
sea-level production rate from γ rays estimated to be
(113 ± 24) atoms/(kgAr day).

the calculated production rates with the different pro-
ton spectra and cross-sections as our estimates of the
central value and uncertainty, yielding a sea-level pro-
duction rate of (3.6 ± 2.2) atoms/(kgAr day).

38Ar(n, γ)39Ar

In atmospheric argon (AAr), 39Ar can also be pro-
duced through the capture of thermal and epi-thermal
neutrons on 38Ar. For the low energy neutron ﬂux we
used the measurements taken in New York (see Fig-
ure 9 taken from Figure 4 in [21]). We note that even
after correcting for altitude, location, and solar activity,
the ﬂux of low energy neutrons varies due to differ-
ences in the local environment [21] and we have there-
fore assumed a 30% uncertainty in the overall normal-
ization of the ﬂux. For the 38Ar(n, γ)39Ar cross-section
we have used the ENDF/B-VIII.I values [44] (shown in
Figure 9) which agrees well with experimental data at
thermal energies [70, 72]. Due to the low abundance
of 38Ar the contribution to the total production rate
((1.1 ± 0.3) atoms/(kgAr day)) is negligible.

The estimates for each of these alternate produc-
tion mechanisms for 39Ar is summarized in Table V,
with fast neutrons contributing 73% of the total pro-
duction rate of 39Ar at sea-level. As partial veri-
ﬁcation, one can compare the estimates of the to-
tal 39Cl production rate to an experimental measure-
ment of the production rate of 39Cl in argon gas ex-
posed at sea level [31]. Summing up the contributions
from fast neutrons ((173 ± 71) atoms(39Cl)/(kgAr day)
through 40Ar(n, d)39Cl) with the alternate mechanisms
listed in Table V, one obtains a total production rate
of (369 ± 76) atoms(39Cl)/(kgAr day) which is in rel-
atively good agreement with the experimentally mea-
sured (288 ± 29) atoms(39Cl)/(kgAr day).

FIG. 9. Thermal and epi-thermal neutron ﬂux (black, left axis)
and capture cross-sections on 36Ar (red) and 38Ar (blue) along
with experimental data points at thermal energies [70–72].

40Ar(p, 2p)39Cl and 40Ar(p, pn)39Ar

At sea-level the ﬂux of 10-100 MeV cosmic ray pro-
tons is at least thirty times lower than that of cosmic
ray neutrons due to the additional electromagnetic in-
teractions of protons in the atmosphere. To estimate the
production rate from protons we have used the proton
spectra from [69] and [68] (scaled by the angular distri-
bution from the EXPACS code) as shown in Figure 7.
Measurements of the 40Ar(p, 2p)39Cl cross-section at
low [83] and high [58] energies are shown in Figure 8
but, due to the low proton ﬂux, the contribution to
the overall production rate at sea-level is negligible.
We are not aware of any measurements of the 40Ar(p,
np)39Ar cross-section (again probably due to the difﬁ-
culty of detecting 39Ar) and have therefore based our es-
timates on the 40Ar(n, d)39Ar cross-section from TALYS,
scaled by the same factor used in Table III. As before, we
have used the mean and sample standard deviation of

level is expected to be (1048 ± 133) atoms/(kgAr day)
for 39Ar, which corresponds to a cosmic ray activation
rate of (8.6 ± 1.1) × 10−8 Bq/(kgAr day) and a saturated
equilibrium activity of (1.21 ± 0.15) × 10−3 Bq/kgAr.
Note that the equilibrium activity at sea-level is lower
than the measured level of 39Ar in the atmosphere be-
cause the total rate in the atmosphere is dominated by
the production at high altitudes, where the neutron ﬂux
is signiﬁcantly higher.

B. Alternate 37Ar Production Mechanisms

40Ar(γ, 3n)37Ar and 40Ar(p, p3n)37Ar

We are not aware of any existing measurements of ei-
ther the 40Ar(γ, 3n)37Ar or the 40Ar(p, p3n)37Ar cross-
section. For the production rate from gammas we used
the cross-section from TALYS (shown in Figure 8), while
for proton induced reactions we have used the pro-
duction rates obtained with the TALYS and INCL++
40Ar(n, 4n)37Ar cross-sections. As above, where mul-
tiple ﬂux or cross-section estimates exist we have used
the mean and sample standard deviation of the cal-
culated production rates as our estimates of the cen-
tral value and uncertainty. We estimate a sea-level
production rate of (3.5 ± 0.7) atoms/(kgAr day) and
(1.3 ± 0.4) atoms/(kgAr day) from 40Ar(γ, 3n)37Ar and
40Ar(p, p3n)37Ar respecively.

36Ar (n, γ)37Ar

In AAr, 37Ar can also be produced through the cap-
ture of thermal and epi-thermal neutrons on 36Ar.
For the 36Ar(n, γ)37Ar cross-section we have used the
ENDF/B-VII.I values [44] (shown in Figure 9) which
agrees well with experimental data at thermal ener-
gies [71, 72], though recent measurements at higher
energies (Maxwellian kT ≈ 47 keV) indicate that the
cross-sections could be signiﬁcantly lower than previ-
ous estimates [72]. This production channel produces
a signiﬁcant contribution to the total production rate of
(36 ± 11) atoms/(kgAr day) at sea-level. Note that the
abundance of 36Ar in argon from underground sources
is reduced by roughly a factor of 40, and hence the
production of 37Ar from neutron captures in UAr is
<1 atom/(kgAr day).

38Ar(n, 2n)37Ar, 38Ar(γ, n)37Ar, and 38Ar(p, pn)37Ar

All of the direct production mechanisms of 39Ar from
40Ar also apply to the production of 37Ar from 38Ar in

10

AAr. We are not aware of any experimental measure-
ments of the cross-sections on 38Ar except for 38Ar(γ,
n)37Ar [80] which is roughly the same as the 40Ar(γ,
n)39Ar cross-section. We have therefore estimated the
production rate from reactions on 38Ar by taking the
sum of the production rates from all direct 40Ar(x,
y)39Ar mechanisms ((679 ± 85) atoms/(kgAr day)) and
scaling it by the abundance of 38Ar in AAr (0.000629).
This is perhaps an overestimation due to the fact that
38Ar has a magic number of neutrons and may therefore
be expected to have lower cross-sections for the ejection
of a neutron than 40Ar, but the contribution is in any
case negligible ((0.43 ± 0.05) atoms/(kgAr day)).

37Ar

The estimates for each of these alternate production
mechanisms for 37Ar is summarized in Table VI. The
total cosmic ray production rate at sea-level is expected
to be (56.7 ± 7.5) atoms/(kgAr day) for 37Ar in un-
derground argon and (92 ± 13) atoms/(kgAr day)

VIII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have made the ﬁrst experimental measurement of
the production rate of 39Ar and 37Ar due to fast neutron
interactions in argon. This measurement was enabled
by the ability to directly measure the β and electron-
capture decays that are not detectable with standard
methods only sensitive to γ-rays from activation prod-
ucts. Including uncertainties in the cross-section mod-
els and the cosmogenic neutron ﬂux we obtained a pro-
duction rate of (759 ± 128) atoms/(kgAr day) for 39Ar,
and (51.0 ± 7.4) atoms/(kgAr day) for 37Ar from cos-
mogenic neutrons at sea-level. Combined with cal-
culated estimates of other production mechanisms,
we obtain a total cosmic ray production rate at sea-
level of (1048 ± 133) atoms/(kgAr day) for 39Ar, and
(92 ± 13) atoms/(kgAr day) for 37Ar in atmospheric ar-
gon ((56.7 ± 7.5) atoms/(kgAr day) for 37Ar in UAr).

These results are most relevant to argon-based dark
matter detectors where 39Ar is the dominant back-
ground and lowering the rate of 39Ar can reduce en-
ergy thresholds and improve sensitivity. The argon ex-
tracted from underground and used as the target for
the DarkSide-50 experiment was measured to have an
39Ar rate of 7.3 × 10−4 Bq/kgAr [15], but it is thought
that a large fraction of the residual 39Ar was due to
an air inﬁltration during the puriﬁcation of the un-
derground gas. Thus it is possible that the measured
activity is only an upper limit, and the true rate of

TABLE VI. Total cosmogenic production rates of 37Ar at sea-level. The ﬁrst row is the estimate from fast neutrons based on the
measurement presented in this work, while the other rows are best estimates made from existing experimental data and models.

39Ar in UAr could be as low as 3 × 10−5 Bq/kgAr [84].
For future multi-ton dark matter detectors low levels of
39Ar are even more critical, and efforts will be made
to avoid any contamination of the underground ar-
gon with the atmosphere [85]. At this possibly lower
intrinsic 39Ar rate, cosmogenic activation of the un-
derground argon (once it is extracted to the surface)
is potentially a signiﬁcant contributor to the overall
background. The results from this paper, scaled by
the cosmic ray ﬂux at the relevant altitudes and loca-
tions, can be used to calculate the experiment-speciﬁc
maximum duration UAr can spend above ground dur-
ing extraction, puriﬁcation, storage, and transporta-
tion. We note that the measured sea-level activation rate
of 39Ar in this paper [(8.6 ± 1.1) × 10−8 Bq/(kgAr day)]
is nearly an order of magnitude larger than previous
estimates based on semi-empirical calculations (0.5–
1.5) × 10−8 Bq/(kgAr day) [50].

Finally, these results can also be used to estimate the
total equilibrium rate of 39Ar and 37Ar in the atmo-
sphere. This is potentially useful for establishing base-

line values for radioactive dating and nuclear activity
monitoring, as well as evaluating the constancy of cos-
mic radiation [51].
