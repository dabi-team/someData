Abstract The DEAP-3600 detector searches for the
scintillation signal from dark matter particles scatter-
ing on a 3.3 tonne liquid argon target. The largest back-
ground comes from 39Ar beta decays and is suppressed
using pulseshape discrimination (PSD).

We use two types of PSD algorithm: the prompt-
fraction, which considers the fraction of the scintilla-
tion signal in a narrow and a wide time window around
the event peak, and the log-likelihood-ratio, which com-
pares the observed photon arrival times to a signal and a
background model. We furthermore use two algorithms
to determine the number of photons detected at a given
time: (1) simply dividing the charge of each PMT pulse
by the charge of a single photoelectron, and (2) a like-
lihood analysis that considers the probability to detect
a certain number of photons at a given time, based on
a model for the scintillation pulseshape and for after-
pulsing in the light detectors.

The prompt-fraction performs approximately as
well as the log-likelihood-ratio PSD algorithm if the
photon detection times are not biased by detector ef-
fects. We explain this result using a model for the in-
formation carried by scintillation photons as a function
of the time when they are detected.

1 Introduction

Liquid argon (LAr) is used as target material in several
current and planned experiments related to the direct
search for WIMP dark matter and studies of neutrino
properties [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Argon provides excel-
lent pulse shape discrimination (PSD) power, which
allows separation of backgrounds in the form of elec-
tron recoils1 (ER) from the WIMP scattering signal
expected to manifest as a nuclear-recoil (NR) event [1,
3,5,8,11].

PSD in LAr is based on the large diﬀerence in life-
times between the argon excimer’s singlet (approxi-
mately 6 ns) and triplet (approximately 1400 ns) states.
Due to this diﬀerence, the singlet-to-triplet ratio, which
depends on linear energy transfer (LET) of the exciting
particle [12], can be determined very well on an event-
by-event basis.

1The term refers to events from particles that cause ionization
and excitation mainly by interacting with the electrons in the
argon atom, e.g. electrons, photons, or muons.

The dominant background in LAr-based dark mat-
ter detectors is the beta-decay of 39Ar, at a rate of ap-
proximately 1 Bq/kg in atmospheric argon [13,14,15].
For a 3 tonne-year exposure, this amounts to O(108)
events per keV in the region of interest for dark matter
search. PSD is well-suited to suppress this background,
as the dark matter-induced NR events have a diﬀerent
LET and thus diﬀerent singlet-to-triplet ratio than the
beta-induced ER events.

Two types of methods are commonly used for PSD
in liquid scintillators that show a double-exponential
pulseshape: the prompt-fraction or tail-fraction, where
the amount of light collected in a prompt or a late win-
dow is compared to the total amount collected, and a
likelihood analysis where the photon detection times
are compared to a signal and a background template.
The implementation of both methods in the context of
LAr scintillation detectors with O(10 kg) target mass
has been discussed in [16], [17], and in [18] we derived a
ﬁrst-principles model for the statistical distribution of
the prompt-fraction PSD parameter. Here, we show the
performance of both methods using 840 livedays of data
from the 3.3 tonne target mass DEAP-3600 detector.

2 The DEAP-3600 detector

We give a brief overview of the DEAP-3600 detector
in this section and refer the reader to [11] for a more
detailed description.

The DEAP-3600 detector is located 2 km under-
ground at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Canada. The centre of
the detector is a spherical volume 170 cm in diameter,
which contains 3.3 tonnes of LAr. The scintillation light
created in the LAr travels through the argon volume un-
til it reaches the surface of the acrylic containment ves-
sel. The inside acrylic surface is coated with TPB, which
shifts the 128 nm scintillation light to the blue spectral
region. The wavelength-shifted light is transmitted to
255 Hamamatsu R5912 high quantum-eﬃciency PMTs
through a total of 50 cm of acrylic comprising the wall
of the acrylic vessel and the acrylic light guides. The
acrylic contains a UV-absorbing additive to suppress
Cherenkov light produced in the vessel and light guides.
The inner detector is sealed inside a stainless steel
sphere and suspended in an 8 m diameter water shield-
ing tank. The tank serves as active muon veto and as
passive neutron moderator.

The signals from the 255 PMTs are passed to cus-
tom ampliﬁers which stretch and amplify them, be-
fore digitization by CAEN V1720 digitizers at 4 ns res-
olution; enough to resolve single-photoelectron (SPE)
pulses. Each PMT channel has a threshold of approxi-
mately 0.1 photoelectrons (PE). To trigger the detector,

a charge approximately equal to at least 19 PE must be
detected across all PMTs in a 177 ns sliding window.
Upon triggering, data from all PMTs are digitized from
−2.6 µs to 14.4 µs relative to the trigger time. The dig-
itized traces are written to disk for oﬄine analysis.

3 Data selection and analysis

3.1 Data selection

The data used in this work represent approximately
840 livedays (4.5 tonne-years after event position cuts)
of DEAP-3600 data taken between November 2016 and
March 2020. The vast majority of recorded events are
from 39Ar β-decays, with a small contribution of γ’s
from radioactivity in detector materials [19]. About
50% of the livetime comes from data where events
within and near the dark matter signal region have been
removed from analysis for blinding purposes. The blind-
ing removes a negligible amount of 39Ar events and will
be discussed in more detail in Sect. 5.4.

Events are selected using the following data cleaning

cuts:

1. Low level DAQ cuts
2. Timing: event peak must be near the DAQ trigger

time

3. Position: the reconstructed event position must be
within the LAr volume and at least 13 cm away from
the inner detector surface

4. Pile-up: at least 20 µs passed since the previous trig-
ger, no more than three photons were detected in
a time window from −2.6 µs to −1.6 µs before the
event peak, and no more than one event peak is
recorded within the digitization time window

These cuts do not remove all backgrounds. For ex-
ample, a population of alpha decays with degraded en-
ergy is expected in the Dark-Matter signal region [10].
The full set of background cuts reduces the acceptance
signiﬁcantly, so to obtain the best possible statistics for
ER events, we do not apply all cuts used in the WIMP
search analysis.

A sample of WIMP recoil events is obtained through
a Monte Carlo simulation (MC) of 40Ar recoils dis-
tributed uniformly in the LAr with a ﬂat energy spec-
trum. The simulation contains the full response of
the detector including scintillation, photon scattering,
wavelength shifting, PMT instrumental eﬀects, and
DAQ instrumental eﬀects. The recoil quenching fac-
tor and the singlet/triplet ratios as a function of en-
ergy are taken from the SCENE measurements [20] at
zero electric ﬁeld. Validation of the WIMP simulation
is described in [10], and systematic uncertainties due

to mis-modelling of 40Ar recoil events are discussed in
Sect. 5.4.

3.2 Photon counting

We use two methods to count the scintillation photons
in a PMT pulse. A standard pulse-ﬁnding algorithm
yields the peak time and the area under the peak for
each pulse from the PMTs [21]. A robust but naive way
to count the number of photons in such a pulse is to
divide the area under the peak, Q, by the mean charge
of an SPE pulse, QSPE. We denote the number of PE
obtained from charge division as qPE.

qPE =

Q
QSPE

(1)

qPE is a biased estimator for the number of scintil-
lation photons. The bias is caused mainly by correlated
noise in the PMT, in the form of afterpulsing (AP).
The DEAP-3600 PMTs have a qPE-weighted AP prob-
ability of approximately 10 % [22,11]. Since AP occurs
in speciﬁc time windows between 100 ns and 10 000 ns,
it modiﬁes the pulseshape [23], and since AP is a sta-
tistical process, it also contributes to the variance of
the qPE count. The bulk of the variance in qPE, how-
ever, is due to the width of the SPE charge distri-
bution. For DEAP-3600 PMTs this width is approxi-
mately σSPE/QSPE ≈ 0.43.

A less biased estimate of the number of scintillation
photons can be obtained using a likelihood analysis.
The method is described in [17], and the implemen-
tation in DEAP-3600 is explained in detail in [24,21,
25], and brieﬂy summarized here. We assume that the
number of PE in a pulse (nPE) is composed of PE from
scintillation photons (nSc) and signals from AP (nAP).
The time response of the wavelength shifter and PMT
dark noise are minor eﬀects here and not considered.
Using Bayes’ theorem, we calculate how likely it is to
observe nPE at the time of each pulse, given the pulse
charge, the LAr scintillation probability density func-
tion (PDF), the times of preceding pulses, the AP time
and charge PDF, and the SPE charge distribution of
the PMT. For a pulse observed at a given time in the
waveform, the posterior probability for nPE is

P (nSc + nAP = nPE|Q) =

p(Q|nPE)p(nSc)p(nAP)
p(Q)

. (2)

The values for nSc and nAP are determined by ﬁnding
the mean over Eq. (2)[25]. The nSc values are real rather
than natural numbers in this approach. The method
diﬀers slightly from what is described in [17] and [24],
where nSc and nAP are estimated by taking the maxi-
mum of the posterior. When taking the maximum, there

4

are regions in the pulseshape where a pulse is always
more likely to originate from AP, and in these time
regions, the algorithm will remove all scintillation pho-
tons.

3.3 Energy and position reconstruction

The event window in DEAP-3600 goes from −28 ns to
10 000 ns relative to the time of the event peak T0. We
denote the total number of PE in the event window as
NPE, or if referring to a particular PE counting method,
as Nqpe or Nnsc. T0 and the event position in the de-
tector are determined respectively based on the photon
detection times across the PMT array and on the pat-
tern of detected photons [10].

NPE is related to the energy deposited in the de-
tector through the light yield. For events in the en-
ergy region of interest (ROI) for dark matter search,
the light yield is approximately 6.05 nSc/keVee or
7.14 qPE/keVee. The small dependence of light yield
on event energy is not relevant for the data considered
here. All event energies are given in electron equivalent
energy, denoted by keVee.

We will use Nnsc as the energy estimator throughout

and p(t)er, normalized to the standard deviation of the
ER event distribution under a given time window,

∆(tprompt) =

1
σer(tprompt)

(cid:90) tprompt

tstart

(p(t)nr − p(t)er)dt ,

(4)

is maximised. For LAr pulseshapes, this is the case for
tprompt in the range of 60 ns to 80 ns2.

In DEAP-3600 tstart=−28 ns, the prompt window
goes up to tprompt=60 ns, and the full event window
ends at ttotal=10 000 ns. The denominator of Eq (3) is
thus equal to NPE. tstart is negative so that photons
that are detected before the event time due to the ﬁnite
timing resolution of the detector are also counted.

This method gives us two PPs:

– Fprompt based on qPE (F qpe
– Fprompt based on nSc(F nsc

4.2 Log-likelihood-ratio

4 PSD parameter deﬁnitions

The diﬀerent PSD methods each deﬁne algorithms for
calculating a PSD Parameter (PP) based on the de-
tection times of scintillation photons for each event.
SD power is based on the fact that diﬀerent types of
interactions produce distinguishable photon detection
PDFs. We denote these PDFs p(t)nr and p(t)er for nu-
clear recoils and electron recoils respectively. p(t)nr and
p(t)er have a dependence on energy that is not explic-
itly written out in the equations. A detailed discussion
of p(t)er can be found in [23].

4.1 Prompt fraction

The prompt fraction PP is commonly used in LAr-
based detectors and is deﬁned as

Fprompt =

(cid:80)t<tprompt
t>tstart
(cid:80)t<ttotal
t>tstart

n(t)

n(t)

(3)

where n can be either n = qPE or n = nSc, and all times
are relative to the event peak time T0.

The time tprompt is chosen such that the diﬀerence
between the cumulative distribution functions of p(t)nr

The construction of the log-likelihood-ratio Lrecoil PP
is described in [17] and [25]. Namely

Lrecoil =

w(t)n(t)

n(t)

with the weights deﬁned as

w(t) =

1
2

· log

p(t)nr
p(t)er

.

(5)

(6)

The scaling and addition of a factor of 1/2 in Eqs. (5)
and (6) are chosen to force the values Lrecoil can take
to fall between zero and one.

We note that the Gatti parameter [28], which is also
commonly used for PSD in scintillation detectors, is
formally the same as the Lrecoil parameter up to third
order in p(t)nr
[25]. It therefore yields similar PSD per-
p(t)er
formance.

The photon detection time PDFs p(t)nr and p(t)er
are created by ﬁrst mixing the singlet and triplet com-
ponent of the pulseshape with weights from [20] for nu-
clear recoils and weights as measured in DEAP-3600
for electron recoils. This step is necessary to account
for the energy dependence of the singlet fraction. Next,

2This is assuming the time resolution is good enough that all
of the singlet light is detected inside the prompt time window.

the model PDF is convolved with the detector time res-
olution from [22] and the TPB ﬂuorescence PDF from
[29]3. Finally, a ﬂat dark noise component is added.
This method can work either with qPE or with nSc.
When using qPE, p(t)er and p(t)nr are also convolved
with the AP PDF.

This method gives us two more PPs:

– Lrecoil based on qPE (Lqpe
– Lrecoil based on nSc (Lnsc

5 Performance of the 4 PSD parameters

5.1 The DEAP-3600 data in 4 PSD parameters

Fig. 1 shows DEAP-3600 data between approximately
100 Nnsc to 200 Nnsc, that is 16 keVee to 33 keVee,
binned by Nnsc on the x-axis and the four diﬀerent PPs
discussed in Sect. 4 on the y-axes.

The blue (brown) lines on each sub-ﬁgure are the
values of the PP above which 50% (90%) of the nuclear
recoil signal can be found, based on MC.

In the hatched regions, the trigger eﬃciency is less
than 99.5%. DEAP-3600 uses a threshold trigger on
the total charge recorded in a sliding window of length
177 ns (see Sect. 2). In the variables available to the
trigger, that is qPE and F qpe
prompt with a prompt window
of −28 ns to 150 ns, the trigger removes all events below
the line described by

TE(NPE) =

N trigger
qpe
NPE

(7)

qpe

where N trigger
is approximately 19 qPE. For oﬄine vari-
ables like Nnsc and all the PPs discussed here, the shape
is more complicated. Furthermore, the details of the
DEAP-3600 data acquisition system lead to a run- and
time-dependent variation in the trigger eﬃciency, which
is calibrated using the method described in [31] and in-
herently has a large uncertainty. The trigger eﬃciency
is then corrected for with the run-speciﬁc calibration,
event-by-event. By comparing the corrected to the un-
corrected sum histograms over all data, the trigger ef-
ﬁciency in Nnsc versus PP space on average across the
data set is found.

Because the trigger eﬃciency has to be calibrated on
a run-by-run basis, and a single run has many empty
bins in regions of Nnsc and Fprompt or Lrecoil far from
the peak, only regions near the peak of the PP distribu-
tion can be corrected. Due to these complications, the
corrected histograms are only used to judge where the

seded by [30], but both shapes are very similar at the time
scales of interest here.

acceptance lines are also shown. Some events are ex-

data are reliable, but do not replace the uncorrected
data.

5.2 The PP distribution model and ﬁts

We want to quantify how close the ER background pop-
ulation is to the NR signal population in Fig. 1 for each
PP and as a function of Nnsc. We denote the two dis-
tributions PER(x, Nnsc) and PNR(x, Nnsc).

For a background-free WIMP search, a cut in the
value of the PP must be chosen such that the proba-
bility for a background event to reconstruct as a signal
event is (cid:28) 1. In order to extrapolate the PER(x, Nnsc)
distribution to all possible values of the PP, a 2-
dimensional empirical model is ﬁt to it. The model de-
scribes the PP distribution as a gamma distribution,

a0, ..., a9 have no physical meaning. The normalization
I(Nnsc) is not ﬂoated in the ﬁt. In the evaluation of
Φ(x, Nnsc), I(Nnsc) is automatically chosen so that the
function value matches the height of the data at the
peak of the histogram.

Turning the one-dimensional distribution into a
two-dimensional one by requiring the shape parameters
to evolve smoothly with Nnsc is not strictly necessary.
For the Lrecoil parameters, each Nnsc-slice is ﬁt sep-
arately with the 1D model, because the behaviour of
the shape parameters with Nnsc is slightly more com-
plicated. However, performing individual 1D ﬁts intro-
duces statistical variation that leads to leakage predic-
tions which are not perfectly smooth as a function of
Nnsc, which is undesirable in the context of constructing
a region of interest for a WIMP search.

Fig. 2 shows the ﬁt results in a 1D slice at
120 Nnsc(this includes events with a value of Nnsc in
[120, 121)). Fig. 3 shows the relative diﬀerence between
model and data over the 2D space for each PP. The
ﬁt is performed over a range on the energy axis of
[98:210] Nnsc, and on the PP axis from the upper edge
of the trigger-eﬃciency curve to 0.6.

5.3 Leakage predictions

We judge the performance of a PP by the probabil-
ity of a background event to leak into the signal re-
gion as a function of Nnsc and nuclear recoil acceptance
(NRA). Fig. 1 shows the means of the background and
signal distributions becoming closer toward lower en-
ergies, which is expected from the energy-dependence
of the singlet to triplet ratio. The separation between

the means of the populations is therefore a function of
energy. The spread of the distributions about the mean
is largely determined by counting statistics, that is by
Nnsc. Hence, it is natural to consider the leakage prob-
ability in slices that are one Nnsc wide.

The NRA is the fraction of signal events in the range

[x, 1],

NRA(x, Nnsc) =

(cid:82) 1
x P NR(x(cid:48), Nnsc)dx(cid:48)
(cid:82) 1
0 P NR(x(cid:48), Nnsc)dx(cid:48)

.

(14)

The uncertainty on the NRA is calculated using the
binomial conﬁdence interval (the Wilson score) at 95%
coverage.

The fraction of ER background events that leaks

into the region [x, 1] is deﬁned similarly as

Pleak(x, Nnsc) =

(cid:82) 1
x Φ(x(cid:48), Nnsc)dx(cid:48)
(cid:82) 1
0 Φ(x(cid:48), Nnsc)dx(cid:48)

(15)

where we use the mathematical model Φ(x, Nnsc) rather
than the data P ER(x, Nnsc).

The uncertainty on Pleak(x, Nnsc) is determined by
assuming the parameter uncertainties returned by the
ﬁtter are Gaussian and randomly drawing parameter
combinations from a multidimensional Gaussian with
mean and standard deviation for each parameter and
correlations between parameters taken from the ﬁt re-
sult. For each parameter combination, P i
leak(x, Nnsc) is
calculated, where i stands for the ith set of randomly
drawn parameters. For each x, the central value of the
leakage probability is the mean over all P i
leak(x, Nnsc)
(this reproduces the curve obtained from the parame-
ter values returned by the ﬁt), and the up (down) un-
certainties are the standard deviations among all cases
where P i
leak(x, Nnsc) is bigger (smaller) than the nomi-
nal value.

Fig. 4 (a) shows P ER, Φ, and P NR, and (b) shows
prompt and at

the respective NRA and Pleak, all for F nsc
Nnsc=110.

In Fig. 5, the leakage probability is shown as a func-
tion of NRA for all four PPs and at two values of Nnsc.
110 Nnsc is close to the lower threshold relevant to the
DEAP-3600 detector, and above 130 Nnsc, the separa-
tion between background and signal populations is so
good that PSD leakage is no longer as relevant.

For 50% and 90% NRA, Fig. 6 shows as a function of
energy the leakage probability and the number of leaked
events per Nnsc this would correspond to in a nominal
1 tonne year exposure. The error bars are dominated by
the uncertainty in the NRA position and are correlated
between bins. The statistical uncertainty from the ﬁt is
negligible.

5.4 Systematic uncertainties

5.4.1 Pile-up

The data contain pile-up events from a) random coin-
cidences between two 39Ar decays b) random coinci-
dences of 39Ar with Cherenkov light produced in the
acrylic, and c) correlated pile-up between Cherenkov
light in the acrylic or PMT glass and an ER event
(other than 39Ar beta decay) in the LAr, for example

from a gamma emitted by 208Tl in the PMT glass that
interacts both in the acrylic and in the LAr. While LAr
scintillation timing has a double-exponential decay time
structure, Cherenkov light is emitted in a ﬂash shorter
than the time resolution of the detector.

The pile-up cuts described in Sect. 3.1 were designed
speciﬁcally to remove these events [21]. Based on MC,
Tab. 1 gives an estimate of the fraction of the data that
still contains pile-up after pile-up cuts. Fractions are
given separately for the second event occurring within

the prompt and the late Fprompt window. Coincidences
within the prompt window tend to make the event more
nuclear-recoil-like, while those in the late window tend
to make the event look less like a nuclear recoil.

39Ar events that have either another 39Ar event or
Cherenkov light randomly piled-up in the late time win-
dow are the most common coincidences. Their eﬀect
is small though, because the second event can have at
most 10% as much light as the ﬁrst event for the pile-up
cuts not to remove it. For example, a 10 PE event (39Ar
or Cherenkov) piling up in the late part of a 120 PE

shown for 39Ar β events (background), together with

39Ar event with Fprompt=0.3 creates a pile-up event re-
constructing at 130 PE and Fprompt=0.277. We veriﬁed
through a toy MC that this level of contamination with
pile-up in the late window does not aﬀect the leakage
predictions.

The next most common type of pile-up is correlated
gamma-Cherenkov events. For example, 10 PE from
Cherenkov light in prompt coincidence with a 120 PE
ER event with Fprompt=0.3 create a pile-up event recon-
structing at 130 PE and Fprompt=0.35. We simulated
Cherenkov light production in PMT glass and acrylic
as well as energy deposition in the LAr from 208Tl in
the PMT glass using the full detector MC to obtain the
event rate and PP distributions in the energy region

paper is concerned with. Based on the MC, the leak-
age of correlated pile-up events starts to dominate over
that of pure ER events at a leakage probability for pure
events smaller than 10−13.

5.4.2 Non-ER events, blinding, and energy-dependence
of the shape parameters

The cuts used do not remove all backgrounds. For ex-
ample, alpha events with degraded energy reconstruct
just above the 39Ar-population in the PP. This leads to
a small increase in the number of events at the upper
edge of the 39Ar population. At the same time, data
blinding removes some events from this region.

The data blinding is implemented in low-level vari-
ables that do not correspond exactly to the PPs and
energy estimator used here, hence there is no sharp line
above which blinding aﬀects the data in the variables

shown here. The blinding removes fewer than 10 events
per Nnsc from the upper edge of the PP distributions.
To study the eﬀect that events at the upper edge of
the 39Ar PP distribution have on the ﬁt, all ﬁts were
repeated with an upper ﬁt limit in the PP parameter
set to be approximately the last bin that still has more
than 10 events. Furthermore, these ﬁts were done using
the 1D model, Eq. (8) convolved with a Gaussian only,
to additionally test the diﬀerence between the two mod-
elling approaches. Fig. 7 shows leakage predictions for
F nsc
prompt based on the standard ﬁt with the 2D model,
based on the ﬁt with the full ﬁt range in F nsc
prompt using
the 1D model, and based on the ﬁt with restricted ﬁt
range in F nsc

prompt using the 1D model.

5.4.3 Modelling of the NR signal region

The position of the dark-matter signal region in each
PP has systematic uncertainties related to how well the
MC describes the detector and to incomplete knowledge
of the ratio of singlet to triplet states created as a func-
tion of energy for nuclear recoil events. We consider here
only the possible mis-modelling of the detector energy
resolution, which has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the width
of the 40Ar distribution and a slight eﬀect on its mean.
For the Fprompt parameters, we construct alternate 40Ar
event distributions with a larger energy resolution con-
sistent with the width of the 39Ar PP distribution, as
described in [10]. The leakage predictions based on this
modiﬁed signal region are shown in Fig. 7.

5.4.4 Data cleaning cuts

After applying low-level and timing cuts, and the pile-
up cut that requires that there is no more than one
event peak within the digitization window, varying the

cut values for the remaining cuts in reasonable ranges
does not change the shape of the PP distribution in any
signiﬁcant way.

Fig. 7: A study of three eﬀects that lead to systematic
uncertainties on the leakage probabilities. The green
up-triangles show the nominal leakage probability for
F nsc
prompt from the 2D ﬁt (the curve is the same as in
Fig. 5). The pink down-triangles use the results from
the 1D ﬁt instead. The purple boxes are obtained with
the 1D ﬁt where the upper ﬁt limit was reduced from
0.6 to 0.55 to exclude bins with fewer than 10 events.
The points overlap, indicating that the ﬁt procedure
does not signiﬁcantly change the leakage predictions.
The brown curve uses an 40Ar distribution modiﬁed to
account for energy resolution diﬀerences between MC
and real data.

6 Stability of the discrimination power in time

The data shown here cover approximately 3.5 years of
real time. We determined the leakage predictions indi-
vidually per month to check if there were any changes
due to detector degradation. Calibrations show no sig-
niﬁcant degradation of the light detection system, so
the most signiﬁcant eﬀects are expected from changes
in light yield or in the observed LAr triplet excimer life-
time due to impurities in the LAr. The triplet lifetime,
which is sensitive to electro-negative impurities [32, 33],
is shown in Fig. 8 for each day when physics data were
recorded. The triplet lifetime is obtained from ﬁts to
the 39Ar-pulseshape of events in the energy region con-
sidered here [23]. The change over 3.5 years is less than
2%. For the Fprompt PPs, this corresponds to a shift in

7 Discussion

We consider the PSD parameter distribution for ap-
proximately 2.9 · 109 events from 16 keVee to 33 keVee,
most of which represent electromagnetic interactions,
largely 39Ar β-decays. The data contain a small frac-
tion of pile-up events that do not signiﬁcantly alter the
distribution shape. Fig. 3 shows that the eﬀective ﬁt
model for the PP-distribution shape of ER events de-
scribes the data to better than 10% accuracy over sev-
eral orders of magnitude. Starting near the upper edge
of the population of electromagnetic events, the model
no longer describes the data well. In this region, non-
ER backgrounds appear, and the event count is further
biased by data blinding. This region does not signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuence the model ﬁt, as shown in Fig. 7

Based on the model ﬁt, we calculate the probability
for ER backgrounds to leak into the NR signal region.
The latter is determined using Monte Carlo simulation.
The simulation does not perfectly describe the shape of
the PP distributions. For the F nsc
prompt PP, an NR distri-
bution shape is constructed to match measured shapes.
The leakage probabilities shown in the remaining ﬁg-
ures are systematically high or low by an amount as
shown in Fig. 7, but the relative diﬀerence between the
performance of the PPs remains the same.

Fig. 5 shows that Lqpe

recoil is an improvement over
F qpe
prompt, but Lnsc
recoil provides little to no improvement
over F nsc
prompt. The fact that the Lrecoil algorithm barely
improves on Fprompt if the input is not signiﬁcantly bi-
ased, even though Lrecoil uses the full information avail-
able about photon arrival times, while Fprompt only con-
siders whether or not photons arrived in the prompt
window, can be understood by considering the weight
functions.

The weight functions for the likelihood-based PP
(Eq. 6) can be seen as the information carried by a pho-
ton as a function of the photon arrival time. A weight of
+1 means the photon points toward the NR-hypothesis,
while a weight of −1 means the photon points toward
the ER-hypothesis. A weight of 0 means that a photon
detected at this time carries no information about the
interaction type.

To compare the photon weight functions for Fprompt
and Lrecoil, the weight function for Fprompt is manually
constructed as a step function: It is 1 in the prompt win-
dow (all photons here count toward the NR hypothesis),
then −1 until the end of the total integration time (all
photons here count toward the ER hypothesis), and 0
at all later times (since they are not considered).

The weight functions for Fprompt and for Lrecoil are
shown together in Fig. 9. The Lrecoil weight function is
shown for PDFs that include diﬀerent detector eﬀects,

Fig. 8: The upper two ﬁgures show the time evolution
of the leakage probabilities at 110 Nnsc and 130 Nnsc
for F nsc
prompt at 50% NRA. The triplet lifetimes in the
third ﬁgure are determined by using the full mathe-
matical model of the 39Ar scintillation pulseshape [23].
The observed triplet lifetime strongly depends on the
state variables of the detector, e.g. temperature, pres-
sure, or impurities diﬀused from the detector into the
liquid argon. A change in the triplet lifetime is expected
to inﬂuence the shape of the PP distribution and hence
causes the PP distribution of the whole data set to be
a superposition of distributions with slightly diﬀerent
parameters.

population of approximately 0.8%.

The leakage predictions shown in Fig. 8 are calcu-
lated against a ﬁxed nuclear recoil band, that is the
position of the NRA lines was not adjusted for changes
in triplet lifetime. We see no signiﬁcant degradation in
PSD performance over the operation time of the DEAP-
3600 detector.

algorithm used to determine nSc is applied individually
for each PMT, where an AP must follow a previous
pulse in the same PMT, so it uses more of the available
information to make a better assessment as to whether
or not a pulse is an AP.

8 Conclusion

Fig. 9: The Lrecoil weight-functions from Eq. (6) cal-
culated for photon detection PDFs that take into ac-
count diﬀerent components of the detector response are
shown. The blue solid line considers only the LAr scin-
tillation (Argon), the pink long-dashed line adds dark
noise (DN), the green short-dash line includes the slow
component of TPB ﬂuorescence (TPB), and the purple
dot-dash line adds afterpulsing (AP). This is compared
to the equivalent weight function used in the Fprompt
PP (yellow dotted line). The insert zooms in on the
time region from −50 ns to 200 ns; for reasons of legibil-
ity, only three of the lines are shown here. Note that the
detector’s time resolution is included in the PDFs the
photon weights are based on. The weight can be inter-
preted as follows: PE detected at times where w(t) > 0
strengthen the NR hypothesis, while PE detected where
w(t) < 0 strengthen the ER hypothesis.

to illustrate their impact. The weights are always close
to +1 near t = 0, where most of the singlet light is
detected. In the absence of detector eﬀects, the weight
function falls sharply after the singlet peak and stays
constant afterwards, because at later times, the singlet
component becomes negligible and the photon weight
becomes the log-ratio of triplet fractions for ER and NR
events. This shape is very similar to the step-function
that is used for Fprompt. This means that the Fprompt
parameter already captures nearly all the available in-
formation.

When adding delayed TPB ﬂuorescence and dark
noise to the PDFs, the weight function still drops
sharply after the singlet peak but then slowly rises to-
wards zero as the signal-to-noise ratio becomes worse.
Including AP in the model adds bumps to the weight
function at the times of high AP probability; due to the
AP, photons at this time contribute little information,

We presented how approximately 2.9 · 109 39Ar beta de-
cay events between approximately 16 keVee to 33 keVee,
collected by the DEAP-3600 detector in 840 live-days,
look under four diﬀerent pulseshape discrimination
methods, and predict their leakage probabilities into
the nuclear-recoil signal region as a function of energy
and nuclear recoil acceptance. With a light yield of
6.05 nSc/keVee, in a 0.165 keVee wide bin at 16 keV
and allowing for a 50% NRA, we estimate that with
the F qpe
prompt PSD parameter a leakage of 7.5 · 10−9 is
achieved, while Lqpe
prompt
and Lnsc

recoil reaches 2.3 · 10−9, and F nsc

recoil both reach approximately 1 · 10−9.

We ﬁnd that due to the time structure of LAr scin-
tillation, likelihood-based methods only improve on the
prompt-fraction method if there is signiﬁcant instru-
mental bias, in this case PMT afterpulsing, and infor-
mation on this bias is included in the likelihood anal-
ysis. Otherwise, the prompt-fraction method captures
nearly all the available information, leaving little room
for the likelihood analysis to make a better assessment
as to the particle type.
