Abstract 
Background: Mental disorders are a leading cause of global health-related burden. The disorders are expected to 
be the leading cause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and depression grows globally. 
Recently, extended reality (XR), a general term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed 
reality (AR) has paved a new avenue to deliver care for mental disorders. This paper provides a systematic review 
about the development and application of XR for anxiety and depression amidst mental disorders.  
Objective:  This systematic study is aimed to investigate the implementation level of different VR, AR, and MR 
techniques in the  care of depression and anxiety. The  objective  of this study is to highlight the XR technologies 
that  were  used  to  deliver  care  for  mental  disorders,  and  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  using  XR  systems  for 
anxiety and depression amidst other mental disorders. 
Methods:  We  performed  a  systematic  review  to  identify  relevant  studies  using  three  databases  namely  Google 
Scholar, PubMED, and Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library. A search period of May 2017 and 
August 2021 was defined to filter out articles related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. 
Using two pre-defined search terms, a total of 689 articles were analyzed. 10 articles were further recommended 
by a professional. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to identify 72 relevant articles for data processing. 

Results:  In   this review we identified 72 studies from 23 countries across the globe, with the majority of studies 
being reported for developed countries such as USA (20.64%) and Germany  (11.11%). Meanwhile, none of  the 
studies observed was from an  African country. The majority  of the articles  reported that XR techniques led to a 
significant  reduction  in  symptoms  of  anxiety  or  depression.  The  majority  of  studies  were  published  in  the  year 
2021,  i.e.  36.51%  (n  =  23)  of  the  total  studies  included.  In  a  sense,  this  data  might  be  attributed  to  COVID-19 
pandemic.  Most  studies  (n  =  30,  47.62%)  focused  a  population  with  age  range  of  18  to  65  years,  while  fewer 
studies (n = 4, 6.35%) focused on each of adolescents (10 – 19 years) and seniors (> 64 years). Also, more studies 
were done experimentally (n = 52, 82.54 %) rather than by analytical and modeling approach (n = 5, 7.94% each) 
as found in other XR studies domain. Thus this could rapidly aid intervention of mental health disorder with XR. 

Conclusions:  In  this  systematic  review  we  investigated  the  implementation  of  XR  in  the  care  of  patients  with 
anxiety  and depression. The review covered 72 studies using different types of  VR, AR, and MR techniques for 
managing  anxiety  and  depression.  Moreover,  the  studies  adopted  unique  designs  that  are  set  up  to  record  the 
effects of the mental health and formulating appropriate therapy for improvements. This review study could aid 
the development of XR systems for effective cognitive behavioral and exposure therapies of mental disorders.

Introduction 
Background 
Mental disorders are defined as behavioral or mental patterns that cause significant distress or impairment 
for an individual. Mental disorders are highly prevalent and configure a leading cause of disability. Over 
the last decades an global increase in the incidence rates of these disorders has been observed, which got 
further  aggravated  as  a  result  of  the  recent  COVID-19  pandemic  [1,  2].  Currently,  mental  services  are 
limited  in  their  accessibility  intensifying  the  societal  struggle  to  meet  the  demands  of  more  and  more 
patients in need across the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental disorders 
are  the  leading  cause  of  disability  in  United  States  and  United  Kingdom  with  almost  20%  of  adults 
experiencing  mental  health  problems  annually  [3].  In  addition  to  adult  group,  adolescents  patients  are 
characterized  with  highest  incidence  of  mental  disorders  in  Canada  and  this  group  have  very  least 
reporting rates in the country [4]. According to a recent epidemiological survey shows that acceleration of 
socioeconomic  developments  increases  the  prevalence  of  mental  disorders  (17.5%  amongst  adults)  in 
China  [5].  WHO  predicted  the  untreated  mental  disorder  to  account  for  13%  of  the  total  burden  of 
diseases  by  2030  [6].  While  over  75%  of  people  with  mental  disorders  remain  untreated  in  developing 
countries, 35 - 50% of the corresponding range is also found in high-income countries [7].  

Amongst all, anxiety  and depression remains the most common  mental disorders in the society [8]. The 
reported cases characterized 1 of 13 of the mental disorders as anxiety with major depressive and specific 
phobia disorders [9]. WHO estimated that these conditions cost the global economy roughly $1 trillion in 
lost productivity  costs annually [10]. Anxiety  or  mood disorders are  closely linked and individuals who 
develop depression have often experienced an anxiety disorder at some earlier point(s) of life [11]. While 
the etiology  of anxiety  disorders and depression is complex, multiple causal factors such as rapid social 
change,  stressful  work  conditions,  gender  discrimination,  social  exclusion,  unhealthy  lifestyle,  physical 
ill-health,  human  rights  violations,  as  well  as  genetics  have  been  appropriately  studied.  Reports  mostly 
suggested that closer mental care should be addressed by increasing accessibility and the development of 
tools that patients can use on their own.  

Conventional Therapeutic Approaches 
Mental  health  therapy  majorly  involves  joining  social,  cognitive  and  behavioral  factors  into  treatment 
procedures [12]. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a conventional treatment approach that has been 
used  and  shown  to  be  effective  for  a  range  of  mental  disorders  such  as  anxiety  disorders,  depression, 
phobia, alcohol and drug use problems, and severe mental illness. CBT dwells on aiding patients follow 
up as their own therapists; thus, it is widely used to treat anxiety disorder and depression. Psychotherapy 
and psychosomatics are two forms of CBT used in treating anxiety disorder. [13]. It became popular as a 
first  line  treatment  since  1980s,  and  mostly  involves  talking  out  matters  that  surrounds  the  anxiety 
disorder  with  patients.  It  works  better  than  (with)  medication  commonly  in  anxiety  treatment,  and  well 
supported by many guidelines [14]. Studies have also shown that CBT is an evidence-based therapy that 
reliably  helps  in  overcoming  depression.  However,  CBT  and  medication  are  combined  as  a  first  line 
treatment option for depression [15]. CBT procedures involve aiding people to identify  and change bad 
lifestyles  that  negatively  influences  their  behavior  and  emotions  [16].    Indeed,  rather  than  been  a  set 
method, CBT is a combination of techniques based on a disorder being treated. For instance, the treatment 
procedure for depression is different from how CBT is used in treating phobic and other anxiety disorders. 

Exposure therapy is a  major  element of CBT-based treatments  for anxiety  and related disorders. In this 
approach, subjects are exposed to feared objects, activities or situations in a safe environment, and this is 
known to reduce patients’ fear and possibility of avoidance. With gradual follow-up, such subjects can be 
helped to overcome their anxiety [17]. The variations of exposure therapy can be majorly classified based 
with  respect  to  their  application  context  as  conventional  (including  in-vivo  and  imaginal  exposure)  and 
modern  exposure.  During  in-vivo  exposure,  patients  are  intentionally  faced  with  real-world  objects  or 
situations they feared to reduce their anxiety [18]. However, this exposure therapy method only works for 

a small percentage of patients despite. Imaginal exposure configures an alternative approach during which 
patients confront their fears in their own mind by imaging worst outcome scenarios. The effectiveness of 
this  approach  depends  on  patients’  motivation  and  ability  to  generate  these  fear-inducing  imaginations. 
Exposure  therapy  is  challenging  as  therapists  require  extensive  training  and  multiple  long  exposure 
sessions. Thus, the conventional therapy method is time-consuming and costly. Recently, XR have been 
evaluated  as  new  delivery  form  for  exposure-based  therapy  of  mental  disorders.  Their  potentials  for 
anxiety and depression have been well reported.  

Extended Reality and Mental Disorder Application  
Extended  reality  (XR)  an  umbrella  term  referring  to  all  real-and-virtual  combined  environments  and 
interactions generated by  computer technology  has been recently  conceived  for  managing  mental health 
disorder  such  as  anxiety  and  depression.  This  recent  technology  is  rapidly  gaining  traction  in  creating 
imagination  of  real  worlds  through  virtual,  augmented,  and  mixed  realities.  Thus,  patients  of  certain 
mental  health  disorders  can  be  virtually  immersed  to  allow  them  display  and  confront  health  disorders 
they  suffer  from.  XR  technology  is  playing  more  of  a  prominent  role  in  different  sectors  such  as 
providing clear benefits in many aspects of work and business, including training, collaborative working 
and marketing. It has been noted that the development of XR can transform the health domain remarkably; 
however, an exciting issue is studying its impact on the future of mental health [19-21]. On the industry 
sector, recent reports shows that XR medical market is estimated to reach USD 1.7 billion in 2022, with a 
compound  annual  growth  rate  of  105.6%  from  2018  to  2022.  Thus,  proving  XR  solutions  will  play  a 
crucial role in the future of medicine. As the market continues to grow, it safe to assume that development 
of XR technologies for treating mental illness will significantly increase over the next decades. 

XR  involves  one  or  more  of  VR,  AR  and  MR  technologies  to  create  exposures.  Virtual  reality  (VR), 
augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) involves using computer models to artificially design real 
world  environments  with  visual  or  other  sensory  features,  and  simulating  typical  contexts  that  induce 
anxiety,  phobia,  or  pain  to  enable  users  interact  with  the  environment.    Development  of  the  artificial 
environment typically consist of four main components 1) a high-end graphics rendering unit that is used 
to compute and render virtual scenes through a frame buffer; 2) 3D stereo display unit that connects users’ 
visual  sensory  to  the  environment;  3)  a  tracking  system  that  models  users’  movement  in  the  virtual 
environment; and lastly, 4) other input interfaces such as joysticks or sensory gloves which provide tactile 
feedback. Results from increasing number of studies suggest that that this form of therapy is effective as 
the  conventional  exposure-based  methods.  [14,  22-24].  It  is  anticipated  that  XR  technology  might  the 
greatest  promise  for  mental  care  [14].  XR-based  exposure  therapies  are  accessible  and  offer  lasting 
improvements for anxiety and depression. Following the numerous therapy designs that have been studied, 
many robust systems with various platforms and formats are available to provide care for different mental 
disorders  [14,  22,  25,  26].  XR  systems  have  been  successfully  applied  in  individual,  group-based,  and 
internet-based settings [27-29]. It started more than two decades when Hoffman’s team [30] developed a 
VR  gaming  system  for  exposure-based  therapy  in  mental  care.  The  SnowWorld  provides  a  system  of 
reducing players’ pain perception during burn wound care. Anderson et al. 2017 presented a follow-up of 
the  first  randomized  clinical  trial  to  test  another  format  for  delivering  cognitive  behavior  therapy  for 
social anxiety  disorder—virtual reality  exposure therapy. The study showed virtual reality  and  exposure 
group  therapy  has  been  well  established  as  an  effective  treatment  for  social  anxiety  disorder.  We 
hypothesized  that  this  is  well  used  for  managing  anxiety  and  depression  therapy  amidst  many  types  of 
mental disorders. 

Delivering  mental  health  treatment  with  extended  reality  has  shown  three  potential  transformations  to 
current  mental  health  care.  VR  or  AR  environments  provide  greater  degree  of  control  for  therapists  to 
customize, reproduce and tweak several treatment parameters according to an individual patient’s needs. 
Such parameters include fan wind, stereo sound, moving chair, color display, and odor emitters [31]. This 
kind of customization may not be achieved in traditional exposure therapy [32, 33]. Also, risks of privacy 

intrusion are reduced as everything is confined to a virtual environment [34]. Furthermore, the simulated 
and  augmented  environments  are  less  scary  than  the  conventional  exposure  therapy  according  to  the 
patients [30]. Exposure-based therapies defined  on VR/AR/MR applications  show to be  effective in the 
treatment  of  a variety  of  other  mental  health  conditions. This study presents  findings  from  a  systematic 
review on the state-of-the-art XR-based exposure therapies for supporting anxiety and depression.  

Objective 
This systematic review is carried out to investigate the implementation level of XR —VR, AR, and MR— 
in the clinical care of depression and anxiety. The review was conducted in with the guidelines outlined 
Arksey  and O’Malley [22].  The main objective of this systematic review is to show the implementation 
and usage levels  of XR-based  therapy in providing  care for anxiety and  depression amidst other  mental 
disorders. The technology-based health intervention domain is advancing rapidly recently; thus, it critical 
to analyze the current state-of-the-art XR techniques that have been lately developed and used to provide 
care. Thus, we set the review study on a) the technological design and usage of XR in providing care for 
mental  disorders  and  demographic  focus  on  anxiety  and  depressive  disorders;  b)  the  components  that 
characterize XR system setups in mental disorder contexts; and c) the effectiveness of XR technology for 
anxiety and depression as top mental disorders.

Methods 
Databases Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria 
We  formulated  a  search  strategy  that  was  used  to  explore  multiple  databases  and  find  all  recent  and 
relevant  research  articles  about  XR  technologies  to  support  the  evaluation  and  treatment  of  depression 
and  anxiety  disorders  amidst  other  mental  health  disorders.  The  systematic  searches  were  conducted 
primarily 
Scholar 
(https://scholar.google.com)  and  Association  for  Computing  Machinery  (ACM)  Digital  Library 
(https://dl.acm.org/search/advanced) databases. The search period was defined to filter out all articles that 
were  published  between  August  2016 and  August  2021  and  indexed  in  any  of  the  three  databases.  The 
three  databases  were  chosen  as  they  provide  simple  and  quick  ways  to  search  across  a  variety  of 
disciplines, databases, and journals, and as well have the most complete indexes of articles that focus on 
the theme of this review study. Multi-level filtering was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines to 
limit  the  search  outcomes  to  relevant  studies  providing  the  most  valuable  data  to  answer  our  research 
questions. The search strategy  was set to limit the our data sources to studies that implemented  or used 
one  or  more  of  VR,  AR,  and  MR  for  exposure-based  evaluation  or  therapy  of  depression  and  anxiety 
disorders amidst other mental disorders. 

Google 

Search Terms 
The search terms  were  discussed amongst the research team  and  were  defined as “Augmented Reality”, 
“Mixed Reality”,  “Virtual Reality”,  “Depression”, and “Anxiety”,  “Mental Health”. These search terms 
are  the  most  appropriated  keywords  that  are  reflected  in  the  studies  that  have  utmost  relevance  to  our 
research questions. The full terms were exclusively used during the search to avoid any potential conflicts 
with other terms such as VR intended for “Virtual Reality” extracting use of related acronyms (e.g., Voice 
Recognition) which would make the filtering cumbersome and not necessarily generate additional useful 
resources. The selection criteria were carefully designed to consider articles that contain one or multiple 
search  terms  in  the  title  and/or  abstract sections  of  the  papers,  while  further  steps  explained  below are 
followed to ensure that the article focuses our prospect.  

Eligibility Criteria 
Since the  adoption of  VR, AR, and  MR in  mental disorder,  management  of anxiety  and depression  has 
evolved with rapid progression. This happens in a similar timeline with developments in the hardware and 
software used for the XR technologies. We decided to limit our data sources to articles published between 
August 2016 and August 2021 to identify only the state-of-the-art technologies.

In  addition,  only  articles  published  in  peer  reviewed  journals  and  conferences  (with  oral  presentation) 
were  considered. Advance search sections of the three databases allow  extracting  more relevant articles 
only by using a set of limiting criteria. For instance, when we used the search filter criteria “anywhere in 
the article” with the defined search terms, 536, 109, and 34 search results were scrapped from PubMED, 
Google  Scholar,  and  ACM  Digital  Library  databases,  respectively.  Additional  10  records  were  also 
identified through professional source. Based on our search strategy and study  goal, we decided to use a 
combination of two search rules namely; i) all the search terms must be present in the article’ title and/or 
abstract,  and  ii)  the  article  publication  year  must  be  within  a  specific  range  between  August  2016  and 
August 2021. Additionally, exclusion criteria were defined that all i) duplicate articles, ii) version updates, 
iii)  articles  written  in  language  other  than  English,  iv)  studies  that  reported  anxiety  or  depression  as  a 
secondary  aspect or induced illness, and v)  articles presenting SWOT  analysis, thesis and  citations, and 
systematic reviews were filtered out. 

Study Selection 
The search strategy yielded 679 articles scrapped from the data sources, and the supplementary 10 articles 
identified through professional source.  The articles are processed as shown in Figure 1. First, irrelevant 
and  duplicate  articles  (i.e.  226  articles)  were  removal;  thus,  a  total  number  of  articles  to  453  were  left. 
Next, the remaining articles were for further screened for relevance. This started with title screening and 
the results obtained  were reviewed  for bias and attrition removal. A total  of 172 texts were  removed in 
this step. Full abstract reviews were done in situations when an article’s relevance could not be resolved 
with  title.  Thus,  100  articles  were  further  screened  out.  Yet,  authors  carried  out  full-text  review  when 
certainty on an article’s relevancies was still lacking to make up the assessment. In total, 272 non-relevant 
articles  were  screened  out  by  the  authors  leaving  only  181  articles  sought  for  retrieval.  A  second 
screening  step  was  required  to  limit  the  systematic  review  to  articles  that  fulfill  the  eligibility  criteria. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, further assessment was carried out and another 108 articles were removed. Full-texts of 73 articles 
were  retrieved.  Articles  out  of  context  (n  =  8)  and  those  lacking  quantitative  data  (n  =  2)  were  also 
excluded. Finally, a total of 72 articles that meet the eligibility criteria were included in this review study. 

Data Extraction 
Three  of  the  authors  performed  the  data  extraction  process  while  the  data  validity  and  accuracy  were 
checked  by  a  fourth  author.  The  full  texts  of  the  72  articles  were  downloaded  and  shared  amongst  the 
authors  for  review.  Specific  details  of  the  articles  listed  below  were  extracted  and  processed  in  a 
spreadsheet to analyze the adoption of VR, AR, and MR in managing anxiety and depression and related 
mental health disorders.  

the study methodology was based on and evaluation strategy;  

1.  Publication authors, year, and regions; 
2.  The study type and study design focus and health domain; 
3.  Methodology e.g., study duration, number of sessions, and duration in minutes; 
4. 
5.  The VR/AR/MR application and technology (type of headset, toolkit) used for the study; 
6.  Study demographics such as targeted population, sample size, and age distribution; 
7.  The motivational strategies, targeted outcome, and region; 
8.  Key findings on the using the XR techniques for managing depression and anxiety.  

The details related to the abovementioned data were utilized to address the two specific questions raised 
in this systematic study. Basically, the data provided  useful insights on developing statistics of the  data 
sources  referred  in  this  systematic  review.  For  instance,  we  could  aid  understanding  of  developers  and 
researchers  on  how  to  aptly  set  VR/AR/MR  system  with  the  extracted  data.  Similarly,  users  can  learn 
about significance of such systems when approaching XR-based exposure therapy for their mental health.  

Results  
Publications Demographics by Country and Year 
This systematic review was based on a total of 72 articles [25, 26, 32, 35-104] (see Appendix 1) selected 
by following the steps discussed in Figure 1. First, we analyzed the country of origin of the articles. The 
72 studies have been conducted by 25 countries across the globe, as shown in Figure 2. 19.44% (n = 14) 
of the studies were carried out in the United States, and this is followed by Germany (n = 8, 11.11%).

Figure 3: Number of studies published per year 

Compared  with  the  previous  study  [16],  it  may  be  said  that  both  countries  dedicated  a  good  amount  of 
research  fund  and  time  to  study  how  XR  aid  mental  health  care  in  the  countries.  Moreover,  our  data 
shows that a good number of studies have been reported from the Netherlands (n = 6, 8.33%) and South 
Korea (n = 5, 6.49%). These countries have good development and economy attraction from XR related 
electronics.  Our  study  infers  that,  compared  to  the  remaining  21  countries,  the  Netherlands  and  South 
Korea countries dedicated the domestic technological development for XR-based mental disorder studies. 
Meanwhile, none  of the studies was reported from an African  country. This either shows a weakness in 
providing mental health services in the continent or blind eye turned to mental disorder in Africa [105].  

In terms of study frequency by year, Figure 3 shows that the majority of the articles 38.89% (n = 28) were 
published in the  year  2021, i.e. of the total studies included. Thus, this further underlines the priority to 
advance  mental  health  care.  In  a  sense,  this  data  might  be  attributed  to  COVID-19  pandemic.  Global 
prevalence  of  anxiety  and  depression  increased  by  25%  in  the  first  year  of  the  pandemic,  while  the 
psychosocial effects of the pandemic varies with regions [106, 107]. Also, Figure 3 shows a similar trend 
in 2017 wherein 16.675% (n = 12) articles were published, and 18.06% of the included works  (n = 13) 
were published in 2019. Meanwhile, the number of studies published in 2016 was the least (4.17%, n = 3), 
and this is momentary similar to the trend observed in 2018 where only 6 (8.33%) studies were published.  

Demographics of XR Usage: Age Population  
We  analyzed  the  age  of  participants  included  in  the  studies  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  Depending  on  the 
inclusion age groups specified by the primary authors, we categorized the study participants as Children, 
Teenagers,  Adolescents,  Young  Adults,  Young  &  Old  Adults,  and  Old  Adults  based  on  the  age  ranges 
reported in those 72 studies. We  declared studies that omitted  such information as  “Not Specified”. For 
this, we analyzed the maturity levels of the participants found in most studies. A substantial age overlap 
was  found  amongst  the  groups  of  individual  included  in  the  reviewed  studies.  Thus,  we  classified  as 
Adults where participants ages were specified to be between 19 and 65 years in the reported studies, and 
as Older Adults where the participants that aged above 65, inclusive. As plotted in Figure 4, we observed 
that  more  studies  (n  =  35,  48.61%)  were  designed  for  adults.  It  is  found  that  small  number  of  studies 
focused  on  younger  subjects.  For  this  age  group,  nine  of  the  72  studies  (n  =  9,  12.50%)  focused  on 
participants between the age of 0 and 12 years, and only 4 of the 72 studies (5.56%) focused teenagers’ 
group  as  well.  Having  such  number  in  these  groups  could  be  due  to  lack  of  standard  way  for  selecting 
audience when developing XR systems for managing mental disorders [108].  

Furthermore, to reflect the level of age diversities in the studies, we analyzed the mean age distribution of 
the participants that were included in each article. Aside the statistical information derived from the age 
groups (in the bar chat of Figure 4), the mean age distributions of the participants were pinned as pie chart 
in Figure 4. The data indicates that majority of the studies (n = 43, 59.72%) were designed for audience 
with a mean age of 35.079 ± 9.72 years. The age distribution in this group is particularly dominated with 
lower  and  upper  values  of  18  years  (n  =  16/43)  and  65  years  (n  =  5/43),  respectively  in  the  different 
participants’ age ranges. The youngest participants that admitted use of XR for mental disorder study are 
a group 4 – 8 year children that were investigated to see how VR reduce anxiety perception in infants [73].

Demographics of XR Usage: Participant Distribution 
Furthermore, we analyzed the sample size  of participants  admitted and  found  eligible in the 72 studies. 
We partitioned the sample size into five different categories and analyzed the number of studies as shown 
in  Figure  5.  The  plot  shows  that  participants  between  21  –  50  people  were  recruited  in  29.17%  of  the 
studies  (n  =  21),  closely  followed  by  having  51  –  100  people  in  22.22%  (n  =  16)  of  all  72  studies. 
Furthermore, 16.67% (n = 12) studies included over 100 participants while very small sample size (≤20 
participants) were considered in 27.78% (n = 19) of the 72 studies. Most of the studies in latter were more 
subtle  in  their  findings  and  conclusions.  Thus,  it  can  be  understood  that  having  relatively  more 
participants is helpful to reach cognate  conclusions. Overall, all the study categories were reported in at 
least 10 studies except in the  case of using 11 – 20 people which was found in only 9 studies (12.50%) 
and  another  three  studies  which  did  not  specify  their  subject’s  population.  The  participants’  gender 
distributions were not analyzed as this data was missing and could not be deduced is a significant number 
of the articles included in this systematic study.

Demographics of Design and Implementation Strategies 
Application  of  XR  systems  for  mental  disorders  requires  vigorous  study  and  implementation  strategies. 
The  design  of  the  studies  included  in  this  review  varied  substantially.  With  a  focus  on  anxiety  and 
depression, the four main types of studies that were are carried out are i) “discussion” which are studies 
with  a  narrative  focus;  ii)  “experimental”:  studies  that  were  done  to  investigate  the  effect  of  the  XR 
techniques  on  certain  groups  of  subjects  or  other  factors  that  aid  or  affect  such  setup;  iii)  “modeling” 
which includes studies that were done to develop new model or setup and such were validated on limited 
subjects or data; and lastly, iv) “analysis” which are the studies done without any particular experimental 
study but relying on  data of previous experimental studies. As shown in Figure 6, it was found the 80.56 % 
(n = 58) were designed with experimental studies and reported how XR could aid intervention of mental 
health disorder out of the four categories. Meanwhile, the studies in the modeling and analysis categories 
only  consist  of  8.33%  (n  =  6)  and  9.72%  (n  =  7)  of  included  studies  respectively.  Studies  with  pure 
narrative are very few as the Discussion studies account for 1.39% of the 72 studies. This review shows 
most  studies  were  done  under  experimental  investigation.  Typically,  this  enables  direct  comparison 
between  the  mental  conditions  and  relationships  with  their  causal  factors  in  psychological  cornerstone 
studies  [109].  Furthermore,  54.17%  (n  =  39)  of  the  included  studies  were  focused  on  investigating  the 
effects  of  XR  immersion  level  used  in  the  studies.  This  shows  that  researchers  in  this  domain  are 
commonly  fond  of investigating how immersion  can influence the  mental health procedures.  The other 
design factors of the XR systems found in the 72 studies are on subject’s personalization (n = 12, 16.67%), 
and cases of manual system designs which were typically focused in 4 studies (5.56%) and automation (n 
=  7,  11.11%)  process.  The  latter  were  majorly  investigated  to  observe  if  real-world  situations  and 
environment are well emulated in the studies.  

The Relationship between Study Periods and Duration per Session  
In addition, we analyzed the common evaluation categories reported in the 72 studies. First, categories of 
study periods (in weeks) and the duration per session (minutes) were analyzed with respect to the number 
of sessions in the studies. As presented in Figure 7a, most of the studies were carried out in 1 – 5 weeks 
(n =22, 30.56%) and 1-5 sessions (n =30, 41.67%), respectively. Other studies followed their participants 
up to 6 – 10 weeks (as found in 8 studies 11.11%,) and 6 – 10 sessions (as found in 13 studies 18.06%), 
and even 11 – 15 weeks or sessions as found in 5 studies (6.94%) or in 6 studies (9.52%), respectively. It 
is noteworthy to emphasize a few studies (n = 1, 1.39%) lasted 16 – 20 (weeks or sessions) while n = 2 
(2.87%) and n = 3 (4.17%) were conducted for in 21 – 50 weeks and sessions, respectively.  

 
Figure 7. Categories of studies investigated for the different mental health disorders in the included studies 

Lastly, one study was reported to have been carried out in over 90 sessions [110]. This was a pilot-study 
developed  with  structured  model  for  restoration  of  socio-cognitive  in  children  (aged  8–13  years)  with 
acquired brain injury. A total of 32 children participated. Each session typically required longer exposure 
duration.  Furthermore,  we  analyzed  the  duration  per  session  (in  minutes)  for  the  sessions  that  were 
reported in each of the studies. In most of the studies (n = 42, 58.33%) participants used XR techniques 
for 0 – 30 minutes. This is followed with studies requiring with 31 – 60 minutes (n = 12, 16.67%) and 61 
–  90  minutes  (n  =  3,  4.17%)  of  user  engagement  per  session.  On  the  extreme  end,  in  one  study  XR 
techniques were used for a session with duration of 120 minutes and even up to 180 minutes in another 
study.  It  was  observed  that  n  =  10  studies  (13.89%)  did  not  specify  the  duration  spent  per  session.  In 
addition, we  analyzed another  common  evaluation  category  used in  most  of the studies included in this 
review. Three main methods were identified and these are quantitative, qualitative, and mixed evaluation 
methods. Overall, quantitative assessment approach is applied in 52.78% (n = 38) of the 72 studies and it 
is  understood  that  qualitative  method  reveals  deeper  insights  about  the  XR-based  interventions. 
Furthermore, quantitative method was used in 11 studies (15.28%), while mixed method was found in 21 
studies (29.17%). We also found that the evaluation methods were not reported in 2 studies see Figure 7c. 

Demographics of XR with Gamification Strategy in Mental Disorders 
Analysis  of  the  XR  techniques  that  are  currently  being  utilised  in  the  care  of  depression  and  anxiety  is 
important.  We  first  analysed  the  major  strategy  found  in  the  studies  included  in  this  review.  During 
review the XR interventions in each study are decided as gamified or otherwise. As shown in Figure 8a, 
34.72% of the studies (n = 25) adopted gamification strategies and this strategy has been used across 18 
mental  health  conditions  in  the  72  articles.  The  few  exceptions  where  gamification  strategy  was  not 
applied  are  pain  and  anxiety,  negative  thoughts,  autoimmune  disorder,  and  acquired  brain  injury. 
Conversely,  non-gamified strategy  was adopted in these  conditions as well as in all other  mental health 
conditions found in the included studies. It can be concluded that the gamification strategy are  yet to be 
found  used  for  some  certain  conditions  such  as  the  autoimmune  disorder  and  acquired  brain  injury.  A 
possible  scenario  is  maybe  such  technology  is  not  suitable  of  research  studies  are  on-going  to  show  its 
applicability.  In  addition, we analyzed the XR applications that have been  used  in the study  and  found 
specific systems such as 3D Unity to be commonly reflected by many authors. Only 49 studies of the 72 
articles  (66.67%)  reported  the  XR  applications  used  in  the  studies.  Many  of  the  applications  were  only 
found in one study and these accounts for 49% of the studies (listed in Appendix). As shown in Figure 8b, 
the exceptions to these are the Unity Pro which was used in 13 studies (26.53%), as well as the Blender 
and Mobile virtual systems were used in 2 studies each (4.08%).

The  most  frequently  used  XR  application  is  the  3D  Unity  Pro  and  that  is  probably  due  to  its  powerful 
editor  to  create  XR  assets,  and  its  cross-platform  development  support.  Similar,  we  observed  that  a 
number  of  studies  (n  =  8,  16.33%)  have  been  carried  out  with  custom  VR  systems.  Such  adaptive 
applications are  either newly  developed  or adopted in those studies and  evaluated for providing  care to 
mental disorders. 

Demographics of XR on Anxiety and Depression amidst Mental Disorders 
Although this systematic review is focused on anxiety and depression, mental health disorders have very 
ambiguous borderline definitions; thus, we reviewed the 18 cases of individual mental disorders in the 72 
articles, and illustrated  count of the  clinical  conditions per publication as shown  in Figure 9. Overall, it 
was observed that most of the XR  studies centered around on anxiety  and depression (n = 35, 48.61%). 
These  include  use  of  XR  for  anxiety  without  depression  in  82.85%  (n  =  29)  of  the  studies,  while  a 
minimal attention (n = 3, 8.57%) was focused on depression without anxiety. Typically, 20.27% (n = 15) 
of the studies focused on just anxiety, while the remaining 14 studies combined anxiety either in general 
terms  or  together  with  other  mental  disorders.  Also,  we  found  another  9.72%  of  the  studies  (n  =  7) 
focused  on  social  anxiety  disorder.  This  condition  was  combined  with  unclassified  distress  in  some 
studies [79, 111]. Additional 11 studies (14.86%) were found to have applied XR technologies for phobia 
(fear  disorders  that  is  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  anxiety).  Use  of  XR  for  other  mental  disorders  without 
anxiety or depression was also studied. For instance, Alzheimer’s Diseases like dementia was investigated 
in 5 studies (6.94%). Comparably,  mild  cognitive impairment, posttraumatic stress disorder, and autism 
spectrum disorder were also investigated in similar strength. We found that both were investigated in 5.56% 
of the studies (n = 4) each, and these are followed by public speaking anxiety reported in 3 studies (4.17%) 
studies.  Unlike  in  Baghaei  et  al  [112],  we  see  that  generalized  anxiety  disorder  was  investigated  as 
specific clinical conditions in 2.78% (n = 2) studies.  Beyond this, the other mental disorders were either 
found in only two studies (i.e. 2.78% each as the case of alcoholic use disorder, psychological stress, and 
attention  disorder) or only  one study. The latter are cases of  negative thoughts, autoimune  disorder, and 
acquired  brain  injury  (n  =  1,  1.39%  each).  These  show  that  adoption  of  XR  is  mostly  adopted  for 
diagnosis and treatment  of anxiety  disorder amidst all  mental disorder  conditions. This includes studies 
that solely focused on anxiety and those where depression is studies with anxiety or isolation.  

Finally,  this  systematic  study  shows  that  XR-based  interventions  are  distinctly  applied  for  anxiety  and 
other  mental  disorder  that  excludes  depression.  A  typical  case  includes  development  of  XR  system  for 
anxiety and phobia as well as anxiety and psychiatric disorders [103, 113]. A good number of studies (n = 
11,  15.28%)  focused  on  using  XR  technology  exclusively  for  managing  individuals  with  phobia.  The 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive  of  XR  for  evaluation  and  treatment  of  mental  disorder  was  identified  in  the  articles  that  were 
reviewed. Recent studies show that VR yields similar effectiveness as exposure-based therapy in reducing 
anxiety symptoms [114]. It is found that Alzheimer’s diseases, attention and hyperactivity disorders, and 
autism  spectrum  disorders  are  the  common  neurodevelopmental  disorders  treated  with  the  XR-based 
technology. This section also  clarifies the  use  of VR technology in  anxiety;  however, it shows that AR 
and MR have been recently emphasized as add-on technology and not as substitute. It becomes clear that 
more studies are still needed for evaluating how AR and MR can singly improve mental health. 

Hardware Technologies used for XR in Mental Disorders 
To  further  fulfil  the  aim  of  this  study,  we  extracted  information  of  the  technologies  used  to  deliver  the 
mental  health  care  in  the  72  studies.  For  inclusiveness  sake,  we  only  reckoned  with  the  hardware 
components that were listed to have been used in setting up XR environments in those studies. As it can 
be  seen  from  Figure  10a,  headsets  was  consistent  in  53.85%  (n  =  35)  of  the  65  studies  that  listed  the 
hardware used. This is the most commonly used component when setting up XR for care delivery in the 
context  of  mental  disorders.  Another  commonly  found  components  that  are  smartphones  and  3D  VR 
glasses which were found in 10.77% (n = 7) and 7.69% (n = 5) of the 65 studies. We refer that the typical 
component are becoming increasingly popular in this study domain, and are majorly found in studies that 
adopted the gamification strategy. 

We further analyzed the  most popular  headset types and  found this including headphones, earbuds, and 
VR head mounts. The latter is a more advanced technology and a basic component in most XR studies. 
As  it  can  be  seen  from  Figure  10b,  nine  (9)  different  types  of  head  mounts  were  listed  in  30  of  the  35 
articles; Samsung Gear VR was the most utilized head mounts in setting up XR environment and that is 
found in 8 studies (26.67%). This is followed by the 3D VR glasses which was used in 6 studies (20.00%), 
and the HTC Vive which was also used in n = 5 (16.67%) studies. In addition, the Oculus Go and Google 
VR Box which were used in 3 studies (10.00%) each. Two articles reported to have used Oculus Rift in 
their studies, while different types of VR simulators such as the Oculus CV1, a custom EEG cap with VR 
head display, and Windows MR headset were used in 1 study (3.33%) each.

Discussion 
Effectiveness of XR technology for anxiety and depression 
Following  the  review  of  the  literature  included  in  this  systematic  study,  it  can  be  concluded  that  XR 
systems are commonly used  for anxiety and depression amidst other mental disorders. The technologies 
was  used  for  anxiety  and  depression  in  48.61%  (n  =  35)  of  the  72  studies  included  in  this  systematic 
review.   The  majority  of  the  studies  were  majorly  targeted  at  cognitive  and  behavioral  change  (n  =  27, 
84.90%) that is subjects going through care are expected to improve in their behavior and/or attitude. This 
is found in line with conceptualization of persuasive computing. The studies reported that the XR systems 
help reduce the symptoms of anxiety. Thus, it can be concluded that the virtual environment are effective 
as exposure therapy in treating  mental disorders. We  found studies investigating if  gamified XR is also 
effective  for  reducing  acrophobia.  The  stimuli  presented  using  AR  could  indeed  induce  physiological 
alteratons  in  the  participants  [47,  115].  Bras    at  al.  [47]  shows  that  AR  and  VR  offer  high  levels  of 
immersion and are optimal solutions for counteracting the effects of in-vivo exposure. Joanneke et al [90] 
showed that, by  engagement and  cognitive biofeedback, gamified VR can  reduce  anxiety symptoms. In 
another study, Veling et al. [103] showed that VR relaxation has positive affective states and short-term 
effects  on  perceived  reducing  psychiatric  stress  and  anxiety  symptoms  disorder  compared  to  standard 
relaxation exercises.  

Furthermore,  it  was  observed  that  XR  technologies  have  been applied  for  providing  care  to  depression 
either discretely or when found with other mental disorders. A total of 6 studies (17.14% of the 35 studies) 
considered depression therapy through XR. Three studies [26, 98, 116] show that VR has good efficacy 
when used for treating anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with the mental disorders. Similarly, 
Li & Luo [62] established that gamified XR can reduce depressive disorders through  cognitive empathy 
and mutual understanding amongst patients and caregivers. In comparison to the reference standard CBT, 
Montesano  et  al.  [72,  117]  improved  the  psychotherapy  of  depressive  disorder  in  young  adults  by 
developing  effective  VR-enhanced  personal  construct  therapy.  These  show  that  recent  development  of 
XR technologies are gaining treatment traction for anxiety. 

Limitations 
The  following  limitations  should  be  considered  when  interpreting  the  results  of  this  review.  The 
developed  search  strategy  was  limited  to  using  PubMED,  Google  Scholar  and  ACM  databases  for 
efficient and accurate search results. This may have excluded qualified articles from additional databases. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We also found that the number of weeks for 33 studies (52.38%) and number of sessions for 18 studies 
(28.57%) were not specified in the articles included in this review. The former has a significantly larger 
percentage in the number of studies considered in this systematic review. Thus, it is hard to assert the best 
number  of  weeks  and  number  of  sessions  needed  for  validating  use  of  XR-based  technology  in  mental 
disorder treatment. This study has identified different major methodological approaches and development 
points that have been studied in the recent time.  Another limitation of the study is the  lack of scientific 
assessment of the quality of the publications that were included in the systematic review. Moreover, due 
to the large number of articles reviewed, there is a possibility of overlooking valid publications that might 
have met the inclusion criteria. Non-English articles were not included in this review either. 

Conclusion and Future Work 
Extended  reality  therapy  has  been  used  widely  for  treating  a  variety  of  mental  health  conditions.  This 
study is designed as a systematic approach of investigating the adoption of XR in mental health disorder: 
a systematic review on anxiety and depression. The review covered 72 studies which used different types 
of  VR,  AR,  and  MR  technology  for  managing  various  syndromes  of  mental  health  disorder  around 
anxiety  and  depression.  The  study  observed  that,  majority  of  the  articles  reported  in  this  domain 
demonstrated a reduction in symptoms of anxiety or depression with the use of XR. Moreover, the studies 
adopted  unique  designs  that  are  set  up  to  record  the  effects  of  the  mental  health  and  formulating 
appropriate  therapy  for  improvements.  We  also  found  that  XR  techniques  have  offered  very  effective 
approaches with high level of users’ acceptability in a range of 18 mental health conditions. Although a 
considerable  number  of  studies  (n  =  72)  were  included  in  this  systematic  review,  some  areas  are  still 
under research thereby lowering the percentage of such studies to be included. For instance, adoption of 
non-gamified  strategies  is  found  to  have  cut  across  18 mental  health  conditions  included  in  this  review 
study.  However,  studies  with  gamification  strategies  were  not  found  on  investigating  pain  and  anxiety, 
negative thoughts, autoimmune  disorder, and acquired brain injury. With respect to the second research 
question, we found that many studies were designed to focus only on anxiety (n = 14, 22.22% of studies) 
unlike a limited number studies found to have solely focused on depression (n = 2). In a previous study, 
Baghaei et al [112] also shows that supporting people with depression in XR settings is an interesting area 
to  explore  for  mental  health  care.  As  presented  in  Appendix  1,  only  17.46  %  (n  =  11)  of  the  included 
studies  carried  out  randomized  controlled  trials  to  study  the  usage  of  the  XR  techniques.  Thus,  future 
works  are  recommended  to  conduct  RCTs  for  investigating  the  use  of  XR  technologies  and  scenarios 
outlined in testing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of XR in the mental disorder management.
