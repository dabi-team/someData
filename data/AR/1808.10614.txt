Abstract 

Low-temperature  epitaxial  growth  of  refractory  transition-metal  nitride  thin  films  by  means  of 

physical vapor deposition has been a recurring theme in advanced thin-film technology for several 

years. In the present study, 150-nm-thick epitaxial HfN layers are grown on MgO(001) by reactive 

high-impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) with no external substrate heating. Maximum film 

growth  temperatures  Ts  due  to  plasma  heating  range  from  70-150  °C,  corresponding  to  Ts/Tm = 

0.10-0.12 (in which Tm is the HfN melting point in K). During HiPIMS, gas and sputtered-metal 

ion fluxes incident at the growing film surface are separated in time due to strong gas rarefaction 

and the transition to a metal-ion dominated plasma. In the present experiments, a negative bias of 

100 V is applied to the substrate, either continuously during the entire deposition or synchronized 

with the metal-rich portion of the ion flux. Two different sputtering-gas mixtures, Ar/N2 and Kr/N2, 

are employed in order to probe effects associated with the noble-gas mass and ionization potential. 

The combination of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution reciprocal-lattice maps, and high-resolution

a relatively high mosaicity and a high concentration of trapped inert gas. In distinct contrast, layers 

grown  in  Kr/N2  with  the  substrate  bias  synchronized  to  the  metal-ion-rich  portion  of  HiPIMS 

pulses, have much lower mosaicity, no measurable inert-gas incorporation, and a hardness of 25.7 

GPa, in good agreement with results for epitaxial HfN(001) layers grown at Ts = 650 °C (Ts/Tm = 

0.26).  The room-temperature  film resistivity  is 70  µΩ-cm, which  is 3.2 to 10  times  lower than 

reported values for polycrystalline HfN layers grown at Ts = 400 °C.  

I. INTRODUCTION 

Refractory  transition-metal  (TM)  nitride  thin  films  are  employed  in  a  wide  variety  of 

applications due to their unique combination of properties including high hardness,1-5 scratch and 

abrasion  resistance,6  low  coefficient  of  friction,7  high-temperature  oxidation  resistance,8-10  and 

tunable  optical,11,12  electrical12-14 and thermal15 properties.  As a result,  TM  nitrides  have gained 

considerable interest over the past decades and become technologically important for use as hard 

wear-resistant coatings,16,17 decorative coatings,18 and diffusion barriers;15,19-24 the latter because 

of their high thermal stability10,25 and low electrical resistivity.13 

Epitaxial  TM and rare-earth  nitride (TiN,26 CrN,27  HfN,28 CeN,29 ZrN,14 and VN11)  layers 

have  been  grown  on  MgO(001)  by  reactive  dc  magnetically-unbalanced  magnetron  sputtering 

(DCMS) in either Ar/N2 or pure N2 environments at elevated temperatures Ts,, typically between 

600  and  850  °C,  using  low-energy,  high-flux  ion-irradiation  of  the  film  surface  during  growth. 

However, in many TM nitride applications, including diffusion barriers, there is a strong drive to 

grow  dense  high-crystalline-quality  films  at  much  lower  temperatures  in  order  to  minimize 

deposition cycling times and allow the use  of thermally-sensitive substrates. Thus, the quest  for 

low-temperature epitaxy (LTE) of high-quality materials has been a recurring theme in materials 

science for several years with the expectation that the knowledge gained in such experiments will 

translate to the growth, at low temperatures, of dense, highly-oriented polycrystalline films. 

Lee et al30 demonstrated that single-crystal LTE TiN layers grown on MgO(001) substrates 

can  be  obtained  in  the  absence  of  applied  substrate  heating  using  high-flux,  low-energy  ion 

irradiation during reactive DCMS in pure N2. The maximum deposition temperature, due to plasma 

2 

 
 
heating, was 420 °C (Ts/Tm ≃ 0.22, in which Tm is the TiN melting point, 3220 K).31 While Ts was 

much less than for conventional epitaxial TiN(001), typically ≥ 700 °C (Ts/Tm ≃ 0.30),26 it is still 

too high for many applications, including film growth on temperature-sensitive substrates such as 

polymers and light-weight metals (e.g., Li, Mg, and Al).  

Here,  we  investigate  the  possibility  of  using  reactive  high-power  impulse  magnetron 

sputtering  (HiPIMS)  to  grow  epitaxial  TM  nitrides  at  much  lower  temperatures,  Ts/Tm ≃ 0.1. 

HiPIMS  allows  ionization  of  up  to  90%  of  sputtered  metal  atoms,  depending  upon  pulsing 

conditions  and  the  choice  of  metal  target.32  Thus,  HiPIMS  offers  the  opportunity  to  increase 

momentum transfer to the growing film, and enhance adatom mean-free paths due to irradiation by 

low-energy  ionized  sputtered  metal  atoms,  rather  than  gas  ions,  during  bias  deposition.33 

Greczynski  et  al34  probed  the  effect  of  metal-  versus  gas-ion  irradiation  during  Ti1-xAlxN  film 

growth  in  mixed  Ar/N2  atmospheres  using  synchronized  pulsed  substrate  bias  in  a  hybrid 

HiPIMS/DCMS  co-sputtering  configuration.  The  results  demonstrated  that  synchronizing  the 

substrate  bias  with  the  metal-rich  portion  of  HiPIMS  pulses  provides  film  densification, 

microstructure enhancement, surface smoothening, and decreased film stress with no measurable 

Ar incorporation.  

We report the LTE growth of HfN on MgO(001), in the absence of applied substrate heating, 

using  reactive  HiPIMS  in  Ar/N2  and  Kr/N2  discharges  with  low-energy  ion  irradiation  of  the 

growing  film.  The  two  gas  mixtures  are  selected  to  provide  significantly  different  momentum 

amu),  and  different  ionization  potentials  (the  first  ionization  potential  of  Ar, 𝐼𝑃Ar

transfer from gas ions to the growing film (mAr = 39.96 amu, mKr = 83.79 amu, while mHf = 178.49 
1 ,  is  15.76  eV, 
1  = 14.00 eV).31 HfN/MgO(001) is chosen as a model system for these experiments since: 

while 𝐼𝑃Kr
(1) HfN has the highest melting point among the TM nitrides (Tm = 3310 °C [3583 K]),31 (2) the 

HfN/MgO(001) system has a large lattice mismatch (7.46%),28 and (3) the growth of high-quality 

HfN/MgO(001) single-crystals has been demonstrated at elevated temperatures.28,35 

We isolate the effect of the nature of the incident ions (gas vs. metal) during film growth by 

comparing the results  of two different  modes  of  applied substrate bias: (i) continuously  applied 

bias  during  the  entire  deposition  and  (ii)  bias  applied  only  in  synchronous  with  the  metal-rich 

portion of each HiPIMS pulse. The maximum substrate temperature, due to plasma heating during 

film  growth,  is  150  °C  (Ts/Tm  <  0.12)  with  continuously-applied  bias  and  70  °C  (Ts/Tm  <  0.10) 

using synchronized bias.  

3 

 
X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  ω-2θ  and  azimuthal  φ  scans,  high-resolution  reciprocal-lattice 

maps (HR-RLMs), and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) 

analyses  establish  that  all  HfN  films  have  a  cube-on-cube  relationship  with  their  MgO(001) 

substrates. The epitaxial  layers with  the  highest quality, grown with synchronized bias  in Kr/N2 

discharges,  are  essentially  fully-relaxed  with  no  measurable  concentration  of  trapped  gas  atoms 

and, hence, low film stress. They also have much lower room-temperature resistivity, 70 vs. 100-

130 µΩ-cm, and a slightly  lower  hardness, 25.7 vs. 26.8-27.6 GPa, than compressively-stressed 

layers grown with continuous bias. A comparison of LTE HfN(001) films grown with a continuous 

substrate bias in Ar/N2 vs. Kr/N2 discharges reveals that the layers deposited in Kr/N2 exhibit lower 

mosaicity.  

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS  

All HfN  layers, 150-nm thick, are grown by magnetically-unbalanced reactive HiPIMS  in 

mixed noble-gas/N2 discharges in a load-locked stainless-steel UHV system with a base pressure 

of 110−9 Torr (1.310-7 Pa). The target is a Hf disk (99.9% purity) with a diameter of 75 mm and 

a thickness of 6 mm. The N2 (99.9995% pure) flow rate is maintained constant at 2.0 sccm, while 

the  noble gas,  Ar or Kr (both 99.9997% pure),  is  introduced through a  leak  valve to maintain a 

constant pressure of 3 mTorr (0.4 Pa) with a N2 fraction of 12 mol%.  

Polished MgO(001) wafers, 10100.5 mm3, whose quality is confirmed following the XRD 

procedure  of  Schroeder  et  al,36  are  used  as  substrates.  The  wafers  are  cleaned  using  successive 

rinses in ultrasonic baths of acetone, isopropanol, and de-ionized water. They are then blown dry 

with N2, mounted  on a Mo substrate  holder, and  inserted  into a differentially-pumped  load-lock 

chamber for transport to the deposition chamber where the wafers are thermally degassed at 800 

°C  for  1h,  a  procedure  shown  to  result  in  sharp  MgO(001)11  reflection  high-energy  electron 

diffraction patterns.37 Following degassing, the substrates are allowed to cool to room temperature. 

The target-to-substrate separation is 11 cm.  

Prior to initiating deposition, the Hf target is sputter etched at 50 W for five minutes in either 

pure  Ar,  or  pure  Kr,  discharges  at  3  mTorr  with  a  shutter  shielding  the  substrate.  During  film 

growth, no external substrate heating is applied. The film-growth temperature Ts(t), due to plasma 

4 

 
 
 
heating, is measured as a function of deposition time t using a thermocouple attached to the top of 

a dummy HfN-coated MgO substrate.  

HiPIMS pulses, 100 µs in length at a frequency of 100 Hz (duty cycle = 1%), are supplied 

by  a HiPSTER 1 pulsing unit (Ionautics AB)  fed by  a dc power supply. The target current  and 

voltage peak shapes are recorded and monitored with a Tektronix TDS 520C digital oscilloscope 

connected  directly  to  the  HiPIMS  pulsing  unit.  Sputter  deposition  is  carried  out  at  a  constant 

average target power of ~150 W. A negative substrate bias Vs = 100 V is applied using one of two 

biasing  schemes:  (i)  continuous  bias  during  the  entire  HiPIMS  pulse,  or  (ii)  bias  synchronized, 

using a second HiPSTER 1 unit, to the metal-rich portion of the discharge, as determined by mass 

spectrometry, during each HiPIMS pulse. For films grown with synchronized bias, ions arrive at 

the substrate during the remainder of the pulse with an energy 𝐸𝑠= -e(𝑉p − 𝑉f) ≈ 10 eV (Vp is the 

plasma potential and  Vf  is the substrate  floating potential), which  is below the bulk  lattice-atom 

displacement threshold for TM nitrides.38  

In situ time-dependent mass and energy spectroscopy analyses of ion fluxes incident at the 

substrate plane are carried out using a Hiden Analytical PSM003 instrument to determine relative 

compositions, charge states, and energies as a function of the choice of inert gas and bias scheme. 

The mass-spectrometer orifice is electrically grounded during these experiments and the ion energy 

is scanned from 1 to 80 eV in 0.5 eV steps. Further details regarding the mass spectrometer can be 

found  elsewhere.39  The  separation  between  the  mass  spectrometer  orifice,  located  below  the 

substrate  position,  and  the  center  of  the  target  is  21  cm.  Thus,  measured  energy  distributions 

underestimate ion-impact energies at the substrate due to additional gas-phase collisions occurring 

between the substrate plane position and the entrance to the mass spectrometer. Ion times-of-flight 

(TOF) are corrected, following the procedure of Bohlmark et al,39 for the difference in position and 

listed in Table 1 for the lowest and highest incident kinetic energies. 

Ion-energy-distribution functions (IEDFs) are recorded for Hf+, Hf2+, Ar+, Ar2+, Kr+, Kr2+, 

N+, and N2+ ions, while sputtering under the same conditions in either Ar/N2 or Kr/N2 gas mixtures. 

Since the quadrupole mass analyzer has a higher transmission at lower mass,40 and because of the 

large mass differences between metallic and gaseous ions in these investigations (ranging from 14 

to 180 amu, see Table 1), the spectrometer settings are separately tuned for each species.

Time-resolved  measurements  of  ion-flux  energy  distributions  are  collected  during  50 

consecutive pulses such that the total acquisition time per data point  is 2 ms. To synchronize the 

measurements with the target-pulse onset, the mass-spectrometer circuit is triggered by a transistor-

transistor logic (TTL) pulse sequence generated at the output of the HiPSTER synchronization unit. 

The gate width is 5 µs, with a 1 µs delay following the pulse onset.  

Compositions  of  as-deposited  HfNx  layers  are  determined  by  time-of-flight  elastic  recoil 

detection analyses (TOF-ERDA) employing a 36 MeV  127I8+ probe beam  incident at 67.5° with 

respect to the sample normal; recoils are detected at an angle of 45°. The results are analyzed using 

CONTES software.41 Uncertainties in reported x values for HfNx films are less than +0.025. 

A  high-resolution  PANalytical  X’pert  XRD  diffractometer  with  a  CuKα1  source  (λ  = 

1.540597 Å) and a four-crystal Ge(220) monochromator is used for determining film orientation. 

Lattice parameters perpendicular a⊥ and parallel a∥ to the film surface, and residual strains ε, are 

obtained  from  high-resolution  reciprocal  lattice  maps  (HR-RLMs)  around  asymmetric  113 

reflections. The RLMs consist of a series of ω-2θ scans acquired over a range of ω offsets. High-

resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses are carried out in a FEI Tecnai 

G2 TF 20 UT instrument operated at 200 kV. Cross-sectional specimens are prepared using a two-

step  procedure  consisting  of  mechanical  polishing  followed  by  Ar+-ion  milling  at  a  shallow 

6 

 
 
incidence  angle  of  6°  from  the  sample  surface,  with  gradually  decreasing  ion  energies:  5  keV 

initially, followed by 2.5, and 1 keV.  

Room-temperature  electrical  resistivities  ρ,  as  a  function  of  film-growth  conditions,  are 

obtained  from  four-point  probe  results,  with  each  reported  ρ  value  averaged  over  ten  separate 

measurements.  Nanoindentation  analyses  of  as-deposited  HfN  films  are  performed  using  a 

Hysitron TI-950 Triboindenter equipped with a sharp Berkovich diamond probe calibrated using a 

fused-silica standard and a single-crystal TiN(001) reference sample.28 A minimum of 30 indents 

is made in each specimen with maximum loads of 1.5 mN. Indentation depths are never allowed to 

exceed 10% of the film thickness in order to minimize substrate effects. Film hardnesses H and 

indentation moduli E are determined using software based on the Oliver and Pharr method.42 

Transport of ions in matter (TRIM),43 a Monte Carlo code included in the stopping power 

and range of ions in matter (SRIM) software package, is used to estimate the reflection probability 

and  average  energy  of  noble-gas  (Ar  or  Kr)  atoms  backscattered  from  a  HfN  target,  as  well  as 

primary-ion and recoil projected ranges of metal- and gas-ions incident at the growing film during 

deposition. 

III. RESULTS  

A. Plasma characterization 

Prior to initiating film-growth experiments, reactive-HiPIMS discharges in mixed Ar/N2 and 

Kr/N2 environments are characterized in order to design substrate bias strategies  as described in 

subsections  III.B  and  III.C.  Figure  1  presents  typical  target  current  IT(t)  and  voltage  VT(t) 

waveforms  acquired  during  HIPIMS  sputtering  of  Hf  in  Ar/N2

  and  Kr/N2  atmospheres.  Both 

voltage  waveforms  are  rectangular  in  shape  with  the  maximum  Kr/N2-discharge  voltage  100  V 

higher than that of Ar/N2. 

IT(t) waveforms exhibit delays in the target current rise onset of ~10 µs for Kr/N2 and ~25 µs 

for Ar/N2, after which the current  increases rapidly  to reach a maximum  value at 50-60 µs, and 

then decreases to a saturation value at ~90 µs, before falling to zero at the end of the HiPIMS pulse. 

The reason for  the earlier current  increase  in the Kr/N2 discharge during pulse  onset  is due to a 

significantly higher Kr vs. Ar electron-impact-ionization cross section,44 which decreases the time 

required to accumulate a sufficiently high electron density for gas breakdown (i.e., rapid discharge 

current  increase). However,  the differences  in 𝐼T(𝑡) during the remainder  of the discharge pulse 

7 

 
 
arise  due  to  significant  recycling  of  the  ionized  process  gas  (primarily  Ar  or  Kr),45,46 since  the 

Ar+
sputter yield of Hf by Ar+ ions (𝑆Hf

Kr+

≃ 0.8) are well below unity, 

Kr/N2 discharges, since the ionization of Kr required for gas recycling is reduced compared to Ar

by the lower electron temperature arising due to: (1) a higher concentration of Hf (for which 𝑆Hf

yield than Ar+.47  

Figure 1. Target voltage VT (upper panel) and current IT (lower panel) waveforms during reactive HiPIMS sputtering 

of Hf in Ar/N2 (solid black line) and Kr/N2 (dashed blue line) discharges at 3 mTorr.  

In situ time-averaged IEDFs for Ar+, N+, N2+, Hf+, and Hf2+ gas and metal ions incident at 

the substrate plane during reactive HiPIMS sputtering of Hf in Ar/N2 and Kr/N2 atmospheres are 

shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. Ar2+ and Kr2+ ions are also detected, but not shown 

here since the sum of their contribution to the total measured ion intensity is < 1%. All gas- and 

metal-ion IEDFs exhibit a narrow low-energy peak located at 1.4 eV in Ar/N2 and 2.0 eV in Kr/N2 

8 

 
 
 
discharges. These values are consistent with previous mass spectrometry investigations of HiPIMS 

discharges,48-50  and  represent  the  potential  drop  between  the  bulk  plasma  potential  and  the 

grounded  orifice  of the  mass spectrometer, across which thermalized  ions are accelerated.48 Hf+ 

and Hf2+ metal-ion IEDFs, for both Ar/N2 and Kr/N2 discharges, exhibit an intense broad peak with 

a maximum near 10 eV, followed by a high-energy tail extending to 80 eV, which we attribute to 

a superposition of a Sigmund-Thompson sputtered-species energy distribution,51,52 ion acceleration 

by  the  combination  of  plasma  and  floating  potentials,  and  HiPIMS  plasma  instabilities  due  to 

collective plasma effects.53-55 

Ar/N2  and  Kr/N2  gas-ion  IEDFs  at  the  substrate  plane  display  significant  differences.  As 

depicted  in  Figure  2(a),  Ar+  IEDFs  possess  a  broad  high-energy  peak  centered  at  ~65  eV.  This 

differs dramatically from Kr+ IEDFs (a typical result is shown in Figure 2(b)), for which only the 

low-energy peak is observed. The high-energy Ar+ ions observed in Ar/N2 HiPIMS discharges arise 

primarily from the high probability of Ar+ ions incident at the target being neutralized and reflected 

from heavy Hf target atoms toward the substrate plane with a significant fraction of the incident 

energy retained.56,57  

An estimate of the maximum backscattering energy Eb,Ar of Ar+ (mAr = 39.95 amu) ions in 

180° reflections from Hf (mHf = 178.49 amu) target atoms is given by the expression57,58  

𝐸b,Ar = (

𝑚Hf − 𝑚Ar
𝑚Hf + 𝑚Ar

2
)

∙ 𝐸i, 

(1) 

for which Ei is the kinetic energy of the incident Ar+ ion, 350 eV, corresponding to acceleration 

across the cathode sheath. Equation (1) yields a maximum  Ar backscattering energy 𝐸b,Ar = 140 

eV. The corresponding value for Kr+ is 𝐸b,Kr = 59 eV, obtained using the higher incident ion energy 

of 450 eV shown in Fig. 1. TRIM43 simulations yield reflection probabilities of 0.27 and 0.10 and 

reflected  energies,  averaged  over  all  backscattering  angles,  of  85  and  39  eV  for  Ar  and  Kr, 

respectively. The angular scattering distribution from the target, combined with the distribution of 

ionization mean free paths, accounts for the large energy spread in recorded Ar+ IEDFs. 

N2

+  IEDFs  exhibit  only  intense  low-energy  peaks,  with  no  high-energy  peaks  or  tails.  A 

similar behavior was recently reported by Greczynski et al during reactive HiPIMS sputtering of 

Hf in Ar/N2.58 N2

+ ions, upon impingement at the Hf target, are dissociatively neutralized to two N 

9 

 
 
 
atoms, which can be backscattered as fast N atoms since mN << mHf. These fast backscattered N 

atoms are partially responsible for the pronounced high-energy tails in N+ IEDFs from both Ar/N2 

and Kr/N2 discharges. The fact that the N+ IEDFs closely resemble the corresponding Hf+ and Hf2+ 

IEDFs  suggests  that  a  significant  fraction  of  the  energetic  N+  ions  also  originate  from  sputter-

ejected N atoms. Modeling studies of reactive HiPIMS discharges have confirmed the importance 

of the target as a source of reactive gas atoms in Ar/O2 discharges,59 and we expect a similar effect 

for Ar/N2.  

The gas-ion  IEDF  intensities  in Figure 2 are significantly  higher  in  Ar/N2 than  in Kr/N2 

discharges. In the former case, the total energy-integrated ion intensity J, with energies above 5 

eV, is dominated by gas ions (𝐽gas/𝐽metal = 2.78); while for Kr/N2 discharges, J is controlled by 

Hf+  and  Hf2+  metal  ions  (𝐽gas/𝐽metal =  0.54).  Furthermore,  the  doubly-to-singly  charged  Hf  ion 

intensity ratio is significantly higher in Ar/N2, 𝐽Hf2+/𝐽Hf+ = 1.7, than in Kr/N2 HiPIMS discharges, 

𝐽Hf2+/𝐽Hf+ = 0.3. This is consistent with previous results for non-reactive HiPIMS sputtering of Ti 
in Ar/N2 versus Kr/N2 discharges.60

11 

 
 
 
 
 
(start of the voltage pulse) in both Figures are due to residual ionized species from the previous 

pulse, as reported for reactive HiPIMS sputtering of Cr in Ar/N2 mixtures.61 With both Ar/N2 and 

Kr/N2 discharges, the total ion intensity during the early part of the HiPIMS pulses (Figure 3) is 

dominated by noble-gas ions. At 40 µs into the HiPIMS pulse, N+ ions represent ~50% of the total 

measured ion intensity incident at the substrate in Ar/N2 and ~30% in Kr/N2.  

Hf+ and Hf2+ ion intensities begin to increase rapidly as gas-ion intensities decrease at t ~ 50 

µs,  in  both  Ar/N2  and  Kr/N2  discharges,  due  to  a  strong  gas  rarefaction  and  the  increased 

availability of Hf neutrals that leads to a decrease in the average plasma electron temperature. The 

latter effect is the result of Hf having a lower first ionization potential than those of the two noble 

gases and  nitrogen (N2 and N) as shown  in  Table 2. Figure 3(a) reveals that measured gas- and 

metal-ion  intensities  are  of  comparable  values  at  t  between  ~100  and  170  µs  in  Ar/N2  HiPIMS 

discharges; no clear metal-ion dominated mode is established. At t = 120 µs, 𝐽gas/𝐽metal reaches a 

minimum value of ~1.8, with Hf2+ ions contributing the major fraction, accounting for ~65% of the 

total metal-ion intensity. In distinct contrast, for Kr/N2 discharges, the ion flux shifts from being 

gas-dominated to metal-dominated at t ~ 55 µs (Figure 3(b)). At 100 µs, metal ions (Hf+ + Hf2+) 

represent ~90% of the total ion intensity with the major contribution, ~70%, being singly-charged 

Hf+ ions. At longer times, t > 200 µs (100 µs after pulse termination), gas rarefaction has decreased 

due  to  gas  refill  and  noble-gas  ions  again  dominate  the  total  ion  flux  in  both  Ar/N2  and  Kr/N2 

discharges.

sputtering of Hf in: (a) Ar/N2 and (b) Kr/N2 discharges at 3 mTorr. 

B. HfN film growth 

Based upon the plasma characterization results in Section III.A, three sets of HfN films are 

deposited  using  two  different  substrate-bias  modes  with  Vs  =  100  V.  In  mode  (i),  Vs  is  applied 

continuously throughout film deposition  in  order to investigate the  effects of gas-ion  irradiation 

during reactive HfN film growth in Ar/N2 vs. Kr/N2 discharges; while in mode (ii), Vs is applied 

only in synchronous with the metal-rich portion of each Kr/N2 HiPIMS pulse, from t = 60 to 160 

13 

 
 
 
 
µs  (i.e.,  60  µs  after  pulse  termination).  We  did  not  carry  out  synchronized-bias  experiments  in 

Ar/N2 discharges since time-resolved mass-spectrometry measurements provided no evidence for 

the presence of a clear metal-ion-dominated regime.  

In bias mode (i) with  Vs  applied continuously,  the  film-growth temperature Ts(t)  increases 

approximately linearly as a function of deposition time from room temperature to a saturation value 

of 150 °C (Ts/Tm < 0.12) after ~30 min during 60-minute deposition runs in both Ar/N2 and Kr/N2 

discharges.  In Kr/N2 discharges with  a synchronous bias,  mode (ii), Ts  increases  to  a saturation 

value of 70 °C (Ts/Tm < 0.10) 40 mins into 60-minute deposition runs.  

ERDA  results  show  that  HfN  films  grown  under  continuous  substrate  bias  in  Ar/N2  are 

overstoichiometric, with a N/Hf ratio  of 1.15, and  O and Ar  concentrations  of 3.6  and 4.0 at%, 

respectively.  Switching  the  inert  gas  from  Ar  to  Kr,  while  maintaining  the  substrate  bias  in  a 

continuous mode, decreases the N/Hf ratio to 1.10, with O and Kr concentrations of 1.8 and 3.0 

at%. For HfN films grown with synchronized bias, the layers are near-stoichiometric with N/Hf = 

1.05 and an O concentration of 1.8 at%. The trapped Kr concentration is ≲ 0.6 at.%.  

C. HfN film nanostructures 

Figure 4 consists of typical ω-2θ XRD scans from HfN films grown with both continuous 

and synchronous substrate bias. Each scan contains two distinct peaks centered at 39.75±0.03° and 

43.0°±0.02°, which are attributed to 002 reflections from HfN and MgO, respectively.28 Both the 

Kα1 and Kα2 peaks of the MgO 002 reflection are resolved. The XRD scans reveal changes in the 

002  HfN  peak  intensity  I002,  the  full  width  at  half  maximum  (FWHM)  intensity  Γ2θ,  and  peak 

positions depending on choice of substrate bias mode and noble gas. For samples deposited with 

continuous  bias,  I002  increases  from  7.6103  cps  with  Ar/N2  to  9.6103  cps  with  Kr/N2,  while 

FWHM values Γ2θ decrease from 0.85° to 0.70°. The results indicate enhanced crystalline quality 

for HfN films grown in Kr/N2 discharges. In addition, the peak position shifts to slightly lower 2θ 

values,  from  39.78°  to  39.75°,  as  the  noble-gas  constituent  is  switched  from  Ar  to  Kr.  For 

comparison, a 2θ value of 39.721° was reported for epitaxial stoichiometric HfN/MgO(001) grown 

at Ts = 650 °C, and 2θ was found to range from 39.6° to 39.8° for HfNx as x was increased from 

0.85 to 1.2.28,35  

Synchronizing the substrate bias to the metal-rich portion of the HiPIMS pulses during HfN 

film growth in Kr/N2 yields 002 peak intensities, I002 = 8.7104 cps, which are approximately an 

14 

 
 
order of magnitude higher than those obtained with a continuous substrate bias in Kr/N2. In addition, 

the  002  peak  FWHM  intensity  Γ2θ  decreases  by  more  than  a  factor  of  2.3  to  0.30°.  The 

synchronized-bias 002 peak position is 39.73°.

at 3 mTorr with a negative substrate bias, Vs = 100 V, applied continuously during HiPIMS pulses. The upper scan is

target power in all cases is 150 W. 

ω-rocking curves, for the same three samples corresponding to the ω-2θ scans in Figure 4, 

are displayed in Figure 5. The HfNx layer grown with a synchronized bias  in Kr/N2 exhibits the 

highest 002 HfN peak intensity and a much lower FWHM Γω value, 1.04°. FWHM Γω values for 

films grown with a continuous substrate bias are 4.70° (Kr/N2) and 5.00° (Ar/N2).

for which Γ2θ and Γω are the FWHM intensities, after correction for instrumental broadening, of 

the 002 Bragg peak in the ω and 2θ directions, respectively, and θ is the Bragg angle. Using the 

data presented in Figures 4 and 5, the coherence lengths for HfN layers deposited in the two noble

gas mixtures with continuous substrate bias are similar: 𝜉||= 26 Å and 𝜉⏊= 114 Å for films grown 

in  Ar/N2,  and  𝜉|| =  28  Å  with  𝜉⏊ =  134  Å  in  Kr/N2.  For  HfN  layers  grown  in  Kr/N2  with  a 

synchronized bias, the coherence lengths are significantly larger: 𝜉|| = 93 Å and 𝜉⏊= 313 Å. Thus, 

the  use  of  primarily  metal-ion,  rather  than  gas-ion,  irradiation  during  the  growth  of  HfN(001) 

results in films with much lower mosaicity and higher crystalline quality.  

Figure 6 shows typical HfN/MgO(001) HR-XRD ϕ scans, obtained in parallel-beam mode, 

with ω and 2θ angles set to detect 220 peaks at a tilt angle of 45° with respect to the surface normal, 

from layers grown in Kr/N2 with synchronized bias. The ϕ scans exhibit four 90°-rotated 220 peaks 

at angular positions which are identical for HfN and the MgO substrate. Similar results are observed 

for  samples  deposited  with  continuous  bias.  The  combination  of  the  XRD  ω-2θ  and  ϕ  scans 

demonstrate  that  all  HfN(001)  layers  grow  epitaxially  with  a  cube-on-cube  relationship  to  the 

substrate: (001)HfN||(001)MgO and [100]HfN||[100]MgO.

along the 113 direction. Diffracted intensity distributions are plotted as isointensity contours as a 

function of the reciprocal lattice vectors k|| parallel and k⏊ perpendicular to the surface. k||  and k⏊ 

are related to θ and ω peak positions via the equations62

and

in which 𝑟E is the Ewald sphere radius, given by 𝑟E = 1/λ. For a 113 reflection from a 001-oriented 

NaCl-structure  sample,  the  in-plane 𝑎|| and  out-of-plane 𝑎⏊lattice  parameters  are  obtained  from 

the  relationships 𝑎|| = √2/𝑘|| and 𝑎⏊ = 3/𝑘⏊.27  The  results  reveal  that  the  lattice  constants  of 

HfN(001) films grown in Kr/N2 discharges with continuous bias are 𝑎||= 4.461 Å and 𝑎⏊= 4.580 

Å, whereas with synchronized bias, 𝑎||= 4.532 Å and 𝑎⏊= 4.552 Å.  

Relaxed bulk HfN lattice 𝑎0constants are determined from 𝑎|| and 𝑎⏊ as63

into  equation 

(5),  we  obtain  

𝑎0 = 4.517 Å for HfN(001) films grown in Kr/N2 discharges with a continuous bias and 𝑎0 = 4.542 

Å in the synchronized-bias mode. Both are within the range of previously reported values, 4.504-

4.543 Å, for polycrystalline and single-crystal HfNx layers.35 The fact that the substrate and layer 

peaks for both HfN samples in Figure 7 are misaligned along k|| indicates the presence of in-plane-

strain relaxation due to misfit dislocations.  

Residual in-plane ε|| and out-of-plane ε⏊ strains are obtained using the equations,

resulting  in 𝜀|| =  -1.23%  and 𝜀⏊ =  1.40%  for  HfN(001)  films  grown  in  Kr/N2  discharges  with 

continuous bias; for synchronized bias, 𝜀|| = -0.21% and 𝜀⏊= 0.22%. Thus, HfNx layers grown in 

Kr/N2 with a continuous bias exhibit significantly larger residual compressive strain, as expected 

based  on  Kr  incorporation  results  (Section  B).  The  degree  of  in-plane  relaxation  at  room-

temperature is obtained from the relationship14 

𝑅lx(300K) =

(9) 

𝑅lx(300K) is 0.81 for HfN(001) films grown in Kr/N2 with continuous bias. Layers grown with 

synchronized bias are essentially fully relaxed with 𝑅lx(300K) = 0.97.

more intense reflections of the substrate, indicating an almost fully-relaxed lattice, in agreement 

with the HR-RLM results. The dark speckles in the image are due to local strain-fields associated 

with point-defect clusters, which are more clearly observed in the lattice-resolution image in Figure 

8(b).  Figure  8(a)  also  reveals  the  presence  of  threading  dislocations  extending  from  the 

film/substrate interface along the growth direction; the associated strain fields appear as dark lines 

in the higher-resolution image, Figure 8(c). The presence of threading dislocations is expected due 

to the very large film/substrate lattice mismatch, 7.46%, which gives rise to a high density of misfit 

dislocations.

C. Film properties 

  Room-temperature resistivities ρ of epitaxial HfN(001) layers grown in Ar/N2 and Kr/N2 

discharges with a continuous bias are 130 and 100 µΩ-cm, respectively; both significantly higher 

than  for HfN grown  in Kr/N2 with synchronized bias, 70 µΩ-cm. However, all three  values are 

much  lower  than  those  reported  for  polycrystalline-HfN  films  deposited  at  400  °C  for  which  ρ 

ranges from 225 to 750 µΩ-cm.65 The resistivity of stoichiometric epitaxial HfN/MgO(001) layers 

grown at Ts = 650 °C (Ts/Tm = 0.26) is 14.2 µΩ-cm.28  

  Hardness  (H)  values  for  HfN  layers  grown  with  a  continuous  bias  in  Ar/N2  and  Kr/N2 

discharges are 27.6±0.5 and 26.8±0.6 GPa, respectively, with elastic moduli (E) of 390±14 GPa for 

both cases. The H and E values of continuous-bias films are slightly higher than those grown with 

synchronized  bias,  H  =  25.7±0.5  and  E  =  373±9  GPa,  due  to  the  much  higher  stress  in  the 

continuous-bias  layers  originating  primarily  from  trapped  noble-gas  atoms.  However,  the 

synchronized-bias  film  results  are  significantly  higher  than  those  reported  for  0.6-µm-thick 

polycrystalline HfNx (1.05 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) layers deposited on Si(001)  at 200 °C using radio-frequency 

sputtering, for which H ranges from 22 to 21 GPa and E from 285 to 370 GPa,66 and in reasonable 

agreement with 0.5-µm-thick epitaxial HfNx (1.05 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) layers deposited at Ts = 650 °C on 

MgO(001) using reactive direct-current sputtering, for which H ranges from 23 to 32 GPa and E 

from 350 to 450 GPa.35  

IV. DISCUSSION 

The  results  presented  in  section  III  demonstrate  very-low-temperature  epitaxial  growth 

(Ts/Tm < 0.10 - 0.12) of HfN on MgO(001) in the absence of applied substrate heating using reactive 

HiPIMS, with low-energy ion irradiation of the growing film, in both Ar/N2 and Kr/N2 discharges.  

Mass-spectroscopy analyses show that the measured ion flux incident at the growing film 

during reactive HiPIMS contains both metal ions, Hf+ and Hf2+, originating from the target, and 

gas ions, primarily N+, N2

+, and either  Ar+  or Kr+.  Based on the  energy-resolved measurements 

shown in Figure 2 and the applied substrate bias, the average incident energies for the metal ions 
are 𝐸Hf+ =  115  eV  and 𝐸Hf2+ =  228  eV.  For  the  gas  ions, 𝐸Ar+ , 𝐸N2
𝐸N+ = 112 eV. Bombardment with energetic ions and fast neutrals during HfN film growth results 

+ and 𝐸Kr+ =  100  eV,  while 

in  overlapping  shallow  collision  cascades  which  help  to  anneal  out  defects  and  desorb  trapped 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
noble-gas atoms. Low-energy bombardment also provides additional kinetic energy to the surface 

and near-surface region of the growing film, enhancing surface adatom mobilities67 necessary for 

LTE.  

Comparing the results for film growth with continuous vs. synchronized bias reveals that 

selecting the metal-rich portion of the ion flux during HiPIMS pulses is an efficient approach for 

improving the crystalline quality of LTE films. Sputtering Hf in Ar/N2 discharges with continuous 

bias yields an ion intensity at the film-growth surface which is dominated by gas ions – Ar+ (26.8%), 

N2

+  (12.2%),  and  N+  (34.6%)  –  and  doubly-charged  metal  Hf2+  ions  (16.6%),  with  a  lower 

contribution  from  singly-charged  Hf+  ions  (9.8%).  In  contrast,  ion  irradiation  conditions  during 

sputter deposition of HfN in mixed Kr/N2 discharges with continuous bias are quite different; the 

relative contribution of metal ions to the total ion intensity is five times larger (~50.9% for Hf+ and 

14.3% for Hf2+), while the metal-charge-state ratio, 𝐽Hf2+/𝐽Hf+, is approximately six times lower 

than values measured in Ar/N2 discharges. 

The  observed  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  ion  flux  between  Ar/N2  and  Kr/N2 

discharges are directly related to differences in the sputtered metal-atom first and second ionization 

potentials  compared  to  the  first-ionization  energy  of  the  noble  gas  (see  Table  2).  The  primary 

ionization mechanism during HiPIMS is via inelastic collisions with energetic electrons.68,69 The 

upper  limit  of the electron-energy distribution 𝐸𝑒 is, to a first approximation, determined by the 
1),  which  dominate  the  initial  part  of  the  HiPIMS 

first-ionization  potential  of  the  noble  gas  (𝐼𝑃g

pulses (Figure 3). Thus, the production rate of Hf2+ and Hf+ metal ions depends strongly on whether

fraction of the plasma electrons have an average energy Ee in the range 𝐼𝑃Hf

the Hf2+  ion density, as shown  in Figure 3. Since both 𝐼𝑃Ar
the effect on the Hf+ production rate of switching noble gases is smaller. The shift in the electron-

1  and 𝐼𝑃Kr

energy distribution between Ar/N2 and Kr/N2 discharges also explains the reduction of N+ and N2

+ 

densities in Kr/N2 discharges.  

Changes in ion bombardment conditions at the growing film due to switching from Ar/N2 

to Kr/N2 are reflected in the XRD results. HfN layers grown in Kr/N2 discharges exhibit a small, 

22 

 
 
 
 
but clear,  improvement in crystalline quality  compared to  films grown in  Ar/N2. In- and  out-of-

plane  x-ray  coherence  lengths  in  Kr/N2  layers  (𝜉|| =  28  Å; 𝜉⏊=  134  Å)  are  slightly  higher  (i.e., 

lower mosaicity) than those deposited in Ar/N2 (𝜉|| = 26 Å; 𝜉⏊= 114 Å). In addition, the trapped 

oxygen concentration in Kr/N2 layers (1.8 at%) is considerably lower than for Ar/N2 films (3.6 at%) 

indicating higher film density. 

Films grown in Kr/N2 discharges with a pulsed substrate bias synchronized to the metal-

ion-rich  portion  of  each  HiPIMS  pulse  are  subjected  to  intense  Hf+  bombardment  (with  greatly 

reduced noble-gas-ion irradiation) of the growing film. During the remaining portion of each pulse, 

Vs is only ~10 eV. Based upon TRIM43 Monte-Carlo simulations, the average Hf+ ion penetration 

depth  is  estimated  to  be  ~14  Å,  with  overlapping  collision  cascades  producing  shallow,  near-

surface dynamic atomic intermixing and noble-gas desorption, thus resulting in films with lower 

residual compressive stress.  

The  average  projected  ranges  for  Hf  and  N  primary  recoils  are  10  and  8  Å  due  to  Hf+ 

bombardment,  and  4  Å  for  both  Hf  and  N  recoils  resulting  from  Kr+  irradiation.  Since  the 

penetration depth for Kr+ is ~6 Å, the film forming species – both the primary Hf+ metal ions and 

the recoiled Hf lattice atoms – penetrate deeper into the near-surface region of the growing film 

than the inert-gas ions and can be directly incorporated into the lattice by filling residual vacancies 

arising due to the low growth temperature (Ts/Tm < 0.10).70 Energetic metal-ion bombardment also 

enhances Hf  adatom mobility and,  hence,  leads to  increased crystalline quality, due to the mass 

match  which  gives  rise  to  more  effective  energy  transfer.  XRD  ω-2θ  (Figure  4)  and  ω-rocking 

curve (Figure 5) results both clearly show that the epitaxial Kr/N2 synchronized-bias films  have 

much lower mosaicity with a larger x-ray coherence length, by a factor of ~3, and lower room-

temperature resistivities than layers grown with continuous bias.  

The  reactive  HiPIMS  results  presented  here,  Kr/N2  vs.  Ar/N2  and  continuous  vs. 

synchronized  bias,  clearly  illustrate  the  importance  of  the  nature  of  the  low-energy  species 

bombarding the film. Selecting plasma conditions favoring bombardment by singly-ionized film-

forming Hf+ species results in a significant increase in the crystalline quality of LTE Hf layers. The 

strategy  is  general  and  can  easily  be  transferred  to  the  growth  of  other  TM-nitride  (as  well  as 

carbide  and  oxide)  systems  and  metallic  films.  Each  material  system  will  require  careful 

experimental design of HiPIMS pulse parameters (maximum target current density and duty cycle), 

time-dependent ion intensities and substrate bias (Vs amplitude and time), and choice of noble gas 

23 

 
 
 
for a given target material in order to obtain the maximum metal-ion/noble-gas-ion ratio and the 

lowest doubly- to singly-charged metal-ion ratio incident at the film-growth surface. 

IV. CONCLUSIONS  

The results presented in Section III demonstrates very-low-temperature (Ts/Tm < 0.10) epitaxial 

growth of HfN thin films on MgO(001) using reactive HiPIMS with the substrate bias synchronized 

to the metal-ion-rich portion of the discharge. The HfN/MgO system was chosen since HfN has 

the highest melting point, 3310 °C,31 of all the TM nitrides and the film/substrate lattice mismatch 

is large, 7.46%, both providing challenges for LTE growth.  

The  highest-crystalline-quality  LTE  HfN  films  are  achieved  in  Kr/N2  discharges  using  a 

substrate bias synchronized with the metal-rich portion of each HiPIMS pulse, which also decreases 

plasma heating such that the film growth temperature is reduced to < 70 °C (Ts increases essentially 

linearly  with  deposition  time  to  reach  a  maximum  of  value  of  70  °C  at  40  min  into  60  min 

deposition runs.). The synchronized bias results in increased Hf+ self-ion irradiation and reduced 

inert  gas-ion  bombardment,  both  leading  to  a  significantly  decreased  film  mosaicity,  and 

correspondingly  lower  resistivity  values.  The  layers  grow  with  a  cube-on-cube  orientation, 

(001)HfN||(001)MgO and [100]HfN||[100]MgO, with respect to  the substrate,  and are  essentially  fully 

relaxed.  The  room  temperature  resistivity  is  ~70  μΩ-cm,  well  below  reported  values  for 

polycrystalline HfN films (ρ = 225 - 750 μΩ-cm) grown at 450 °C.65 Hardness and elastic moduli 

values from nanoindentation experiments are 25.7±0.5 GPa and 373±9 GPa, respectively, in good 

agreement with  values reported  for single-crystal HfNx (1.05  x   1.2)  films grown at 650  °C 

(Ts/Tm = 0.26) using reactive dc sputtering: 23 < H < 32 GPa and 350 < E < 450 GPa.35  

Layers  grown  in  Ar/N2  discharges  under  continuous  bias  (Vs  =  100  V)  reach  a  maximum 

substrate temperature of 120 °C (Ts/Tm = 0.12) due to plasma heating and have lower crystalline 

quality than those grown in Kr/N2 with continuous bias. This  is manifested  in higher mosaicity, 

trapped  noble-gas concentration, and porosity. Switching to a Kr/N2 discharge, with continuous 

bias, suppresses the formation of high-energy gas ions, particularly N+.
