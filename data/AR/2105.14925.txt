Abstract:  

We  investigated  the  transport  titanium  ions  produced  in  a  reactive  high-power  impulse  magnetron  sputtering 
(HiPIMS) device used for TiN coating deposition. Time-resolved mass spectrometry measurements of ionized 

sputtered  atoms  correlated 

to 

time-resolved 

tuneable  diode-laser 

induced  fluorescence  (TR-TDLIF) 

measurements  of  neutral  sputtered  atoms  were  used  to  understand  transport  features.  Based  on  ion  energy 
distributions of Ti+, we identified four populations of ions and explore their physical origins. The signals of all 
ion  populations  decrease  strongly  when  only  1%  N2  is  added  to  the  Ar/N2 gas  mixture.  Time  resolved  mass 
spectrometry confirms the result reported in previous work: the fast target poisoning when nitrogen is added in 
+, and Ar+, we discuss 
HiPIMS discharges. Based on the measured energy distribution functions of Ti++, N+, N2
the  production  of  these  ions  in  HiPIMS  discharges.  The  temperature  of  thermalized  sputtered  neutral  atoms 

determined  by  previous  TR-TDLIF  measurements  evidences  the  physical  origin  of  an  ion  population  with 

energies lower than 4 eV. According to discharge pressure, cathode voltage, and ion type, we also discuss the 
physical origins of high-energy ions (>4 eV). 

Keywords: HiPIMS, R-HiPIMS, time-resolved mass spectrometry, ion transport processes. 

I. Introduction  

Reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (R-HiPIMS) is an ionized physical vapor deposition method [1,2] in 

which high power is applied during short pulses to achieve greater than 50% ionization of the metallic sputtered vapor. 
The power is turned on during short pulses and turned off  for longer periods post-discharge  to avoid  overheating  the 

magnetron cathode and arc formation. Sputtered atoms are ionized to control their energy on the substrate and therefore 
to monitor the properties of the thin film. Indeed, ion energy is influenced by the electric field produced when a negative 

bias is applied to the substrate. Ion-assisted film growth meets the requirements of applications for which it is necessary 
to improve the quality of the deposited film, for example, in terms of mechanical properties (dense films with reduced 

porosity, better corrosion resistance) and in the case  of substrates  with complex 3D  geometries. Therefore,  with  high 

spatiotemporal knowledge of the properties of the incoming film-forming species (neutral atoms and ions) in R-HiPIMS, 
the physical properties of the film can be adjusted to target applications [3–5]. In other words, a clear understanding of 

the  basic  processes  governing  the  transport  of  neutral  atoms  and  ions  is  crucial  for  optimizing  material  deposition 
processes for new applications. 

In the sputtering process, the transport of neutral atoms of metallic vapor has been thoroughly investigated for different 

target materials using optical diagnostics, mostly tunable diode-laser induced fluorescence (TDLIF) or laser absorption 

spectroscopy [6–13]. Because R-HiPIMS is performed at low pressure (p ≈ 1 Pa), an intermediate transport regime, not 

1 

 
 
purely ballistic nor diffusive, has been highlighted in the cases of sputtering titanium and tungsten targets [14,15]. In these 
two cases, and thanks to specific laser diodes, a diagnostic has been developed to perform time-resolved measurements 

of  neutral  atoms.  However,  no  diode  laser  is  available  at  wavelengths  allowing  the  measurement  of  ion  velocity 

distribution functions. Therefore, ion energies in HiPIMS processes are commonly characterized by mass spectrometry 
[16,17]. 

The study of metallic ion transport in HiPIMS plasmas is much more complicated than the case of the transport of neutral 

atoms  for  three  reasons.  First,  ions  are  produced  from  neutral  atoms  sputtered  from  the  target,  which  have  an  initial 

velocity  distribution  (the  Thompson  distribution  [18,19])  that  is  modified  by  collisions  with  the  buffer  gas  during 
transport. Second, because ions are strongly driven by the potential/electric fields, any variation of the cathode voltage 
and/or plasma potential impacts their transport. Third, due to magnetized plasma discharge in an E⃗⃗  × B⃗⃗  configuration, the 
emergence of structures called ‘spokes’ can move the charged particles in the azimuthal direction [20–23], which can also 

importantly affect ion transport in the axial direction.  Although numerous studies have measured ionic fluxes by mass 

spectrometry  [17,24–27],  in  most  cases,  the  long  discharge  times  used  (td  >  30  s)  resulted  in  the  simultaneous 
involvement of sputtering and transport processes. Palmucci et al [17] distinguished only two ion populations (cold and 

hot ions at 0–5 and 5–30 eV, respectively) despite measurements performed at a temporal resolution of 2 s and the use 

of short HiPIMS pulses of 5 s. 

In  this  work,  we  study  ion  transport  in  a  short-pulse  R-HiPIMS  process  used  for  titanium  nitride  (TiN)  thin-film 
deposition. TiN film was chosen for its good mechanical and optical properties, excellent chemical resistance, and good 

biocompatibility, but we note that film properties are not the specific focus of this work. In our previous work on the 
transport of sputtered neutral titanium atoms in Ar/N2 HiPIMS discharge, we observed that the deposited flux and energy 
remain  constant  with  increasing  N2  content  (≥1%)  in  the  gas  mixture  [14]. This  surprising  behaviour  with  increasing 
fraction  of  reactive  gas  raises  the  need  to  characterize  the  ions  by  time-resolved  mass  spectrometry.  Moreover,  the 
correlation between time-resolved TDLIF (TR-TDLIF) [12] and mass spectrometry measurements can provide a clear 

understanding of the transport properties of the different ions produced in the HiPIMS process. 

In  the  first  part  of  this  work,  we  characterize  the  effects  of  nitrogen  on  the  ionization  of  sputtered  atoms  (i.e.,  the 
production of Ti+ ions). Our analysis of ion energy distribution functions (IEDFs) by time-resolved mass spectrometry 
revealed four populations of Ti+ ions. In the second part, we characterize the IEDFs of different types of ions (Ti++, N+, 
+, and Ar+). In the last part, we report experiments performed over a wide range of discharge parameters (pressure, 
N2
distance between the target and the orifice of the mass spectrometer, gas mixture composition) to investigate the physical 

origins of the different ion populations. This investigation relies on the correlation between the IEDFs to the previous 
measurements of the flux of neutral titanium atoms performed by TR-TDLIF and the measurements of cathode voltage 

in which was performed using a voltage probe. 

II. Experimental setup 

The experiments  were conducted in the reactor used in our previous work [6], comprising a cylindrical stainless-steel 

chamber 35 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter and equipped with a turbomolecular pump to achieve a vacuum pressure 
of 2 × 10−4 Pa before injecting gas into the chamber. A water-cooled 2-inch balanced magnetron cathode with a 99.99% 
purity titanium target 3 mm thick was used as the sputtering source. At a constant total flow rate of 18 sccm, Ar and N2 
gases were added into the chamber at various N2/(Ar+N2) flow-rate ratios (0–10%). The gas arriving in the chamber was 
inserted farther than 20 cm from the magnetron cathode. The discharge was powered by a MELEC SIPP 2000 HiPIMS 
generator (Umax =1 kV, Imax_peak = 200 A). To correlate mass spectrometry measurements with previous TR-TDLIF results 
[14], the HiPIMS discharge power was fixed at P = 350 W cm−2 (U = 500 V, I = 20 A) during discharge (td = 10 μs) and 

2 

 
the repetition frequency was fixed at 1 kHz (corresponding to a duty cycle of 1%). These parameters were specifically 
chosen  to  temporally  separate  the  sputtering  phase  during  discharge  from  the  post-discharge  transport  phase,  and  are 

discussed further in [14]. The HiPIMS voltage was monitored by a P6015A Tektronix probe with a bandwidth of 75 MHz 

and a rise time of 4 ns. The voltage probe was connected to the magnetron within 30 cm from the cathode. 

Figure 1. Schematic of the experimental setup. 

A HIDEN EQP 300 instrument was used to measure the time-resolved IEDFs (TR-IEDFs) of Ti+, Ar+, N+, Ti++, and N++. 
The grounded 100-µm-diameter orifice of the mass spectrometer was placed in the virtual position of the substrate. Local 
TR-TDLIF  measurements  have  been  obtained  in  volumes  located  above  the  racetrack  (R0  =  1.3  cm)  [14].  However, 
because of the reactor geometry, mass spectrometry measurements were made in front of the centre of the target (R0 = 0 
cm, z = 5 or 12 cm; see schematic in figure 1). At 0.4 Pa and a high percentage of N2, the plasma is not stable when the 
head of the mass spectrometer is at z = 5 cm. A Tektronix AFG3022C function generator was used to trigger the HiPIMS 
pulses  and  synchronize  the  secondary  electron  multiplier  (SEM)  detector  of  the  mass  spectrometer  with  the  HiPIMS 

generator, allowing time-resolved  measurements. A 20  s integration  gate  was chosen  to obtain the best compromise 

between measured signal intensity (good signal-to-noise ratio over a dwell time of 1 ms) and characterization of the full 

HiPIMS period (discharge + post-discharge) in a reasonable time. In addition, because the SEM detector is synchronized 

with the plasma pulses, an ion’s detection time at the SEM corresponds to its arrival time at the orifice plus its transit time 
in the spectrometer (time of flight, TOF). Therefore, measurement corrections account for ion-specific TOFs inside the 
mass spectrometer, which are determined by the ions’ velocities in each part of the spectrometer (e.g., extractor, analysers, 
detector) and are obtained by different accelerating or decelerating voltages. The corresponding TOF values for the ions 

of interest in our mass spectrometer  were calculated according to the formula provided by the manufacturer (table 1). 
These transit times strongly depend on the ions’ mass/charge ratios, but are not sensitive to their energy at the entrance 

of the mass spectrometer for energies between 0 and 100 eV [26]. The quantitative calibration of a mass spectrometer is 

not an easy task because the transmission of ions depends on multiple parameters: orifice, extractor, analysers, detector 
response, and ionic mass and energy. Here, our mass spectrometer measurements were not calibrated, so we discuss only 

qualitative signal variations.

The entire HiPIMS period was scanned using a variable time step between each measurement. We started with a time 
step δt = 20 μs until the newly created ions appear (ions of 20 eV in figure 2). Then, we used shorter step of δt = 5 μs to 

better describe  the temporal evolution of this  new  energy  distribution until the  mass  spectrometer signal decreases to 
about 50% of the maximum observed value. Then, δt was gradually increased until the end of the post-discharge period 

to track later slight temporal variations of the IEDF. Using this specific method, one temporal evolution is characterized 
by approximately 25 measurements, which takes about 60 min. Figure 2 illustrates TR-IEDFs for Ti+ ions under a typical 
plasma condition (0.7 Pa, z = 5 cm, pure Ar). The ions in this figure can be classified into three groups based on their 

energies: ions of the first, second, and third groups have energies of 0–15, 15–50, and >50 eV, respectively. Here and in 
all following figures, the time indicated corresponds to the ions’ arrivals at the mass spectrometer orifice, and the origin 

time (t = 0 s) corresponds to the start of the HiPIMS discharge.

III.1.1. Identification of four ion populations 

At  0.7  Pa, one  can  observe  the  existence  of  three  groups  of  Ti+  ions  (figure  2).  However,  by  increasing  the  working 
pressure to 2.7 Pa, four ion populations can be identified (figure 3): 

- 

Population  1  (Pop1)  has  energies  of  about  0–4  eV.  This  population  appears  late  during  the  post-discharge 

period, ~40 μs after the beginning of the discharge. At the studied conditions, this population is smaller than 
the other populations and is difficult to identify at low pressure (0.7 Pa). 

- 

- 

Population 2 (Pop2) has energies of 4–15 eV; it also depends on the working pressure, and is less pronounced 
at 0.7 Pa. 

Population 3 (Pop3) has energies of 15–50 eV with a peak around 20 eV. This population is predominant at 
low pressure (0.7 Pa) but is still pronounced at higher pressure (2.7 Pa). 

- 

Population 4 (Pop4) includes ions with energies >50 eV and behaves similar to Pop2, i.e., it becomes more 

pronounced with increasing pressure. 

These populations are defined purely in terms of ion energy and their possible physical origins will be discussed in section 

III.3.

where El and Eu are the lower and upper energy limits of the considered population (‘popX’), respectively. We thusly 
determined the individual time evolutions of Pop1–4 (figure 4) bearing in mind that this time evolution is the convolution 

of real time evolution of ions flux and the rectangular function corresponding to the acquisition time of 20 s. Then, we 

classified the  populations in  two  groups  based on their arrival times  at  the spectrometer; the high-energy populations 

(Pop3 and Pop4) were detected between 0 and 150 μs after the discharge and the low-energy populations were present 

during the entire post-discharge period. This distinction implies that Pop3 and Pop4 are transported ballistically; they 
reach the spectrometer aperture just after the end of the discharge, as in the case of energetic neutral (EN) atoms, whereas 

Pop1 and Pop2 exhibit collisional transport more similar to diffusion (see figure 3 in [14]), as in the case of thermalized 
neutral (TH) atoms. Notably, Pop3 seems to evolve quite differently from the other three populations. With increasing

pressure, the intensities of the other populations grow at the expense of Pop3, although we could identify no variation in 
terms of energy: Pop3 acts as a reservoir for the other populations via collisions with the background gas.

Avino et al [28] performed such time-resolved measurements at high temporal resolution by selecting only the energies 
corresponding to the maxima of the distributions of each population. Moreover, Breilmann et al [29] combined such high 

temporal resolution measurements with high energy resolution measurements. Here, we chose to characterize the IEDFs 
at high energy resolution and relatively low  temporal resolution in order to describe the  entire HiPIMS period (1 ms) 

within a reasonable analysis time. Indeed, our main goal is to better understand the influence of plasma parameters on the 

evolution of the different ion populations and provide information on their physical origins. 

III.1.2. Reactive sputtering 

The introduction of a reactive molecule, here N2, to the argon HiPIMS discharge should generally lead to a variation of the electron 
density and energy. Due to the vibrational and rotational energies of the N2 molecule, the electrons in the plasma should dissipate their 
energy by inelastic collisions. Furthermore, the reactive gas contributes to the formation of a compound layer on the target  surface, 
which then affects parameters linked to the surface state, including the secondary electron emission coefficient [30], the sputtering 
yield, the cathode current, and the cathode voltage at a fixed HiPIMS mean power. In addition, in such a discharge, the sputtered atoms 
are highly ionized (usually >50%), possibly modifying the electron density [3]. In our previous work, the measurements by means of 
time average mass spectrometry (for Ti+ ions) and TR-TDLIF (for Ti neutral atoms) revealed  a strong decrease of Ti+ and Ti fluxes 
when 1% N2 is added to gas mixture (see figures 8 and 13 in [14]). For this strong decrease of both species, the poisoning target was 

identified as the main cause because the surface effect on sputtering dominates that of the plasma in our conditions.  

In the present work, we present new TR-IEDFs’ measurements to confirm that the fast target poisoning can be observed on each Ti+ 
population when nitrogen is added in HiPIMS discharge. Figure 5 shows the temporal evolution of the four populations of Ti+ ions at 
different percentages of nitrogen in the background gas mixture at 2.7 Pa and a distance of 5 cm between the mass spectrometer orifice 
and the target. As expected, each population’s signal decreases strongly when only 1% N2 is added to the gas mixture, although further 
increasing the fraction of N2 does not significantly affect any population’s temporal evolution.

III.2. Characterization of Ti+, Ti++, N+, N2

+, and Ar+ 

We measured TR-IEDFs of Ti++, N+, N2
+, and Ar+ to better characterize the HiPIMS process, and particularly to highlight 
the types of ions generated in the plasma volume. The major difficulty here is to analyse the distributions of the different 

types  of  ions  measured  by  the  mass  spectrometer  because  they  can  be  generated  at  different  discharge  times  and  at 
different  locations  between the  sputtered  target and the deposition area (here,  the  aperture  of the  mass spectrometer). 

Therefore, their arrival times do not necessarily correspond to the transport time between the target (or the dense plasma) 
and the spectrometer. Our main objective in characterizing these ions was therefore to better understand their production; 
by comparing their TR-IEDFs, we hope to constrain the possible explanations of the four observed Ti+ populations. 

Figure 6 shows the TR-IEDFs of Ti+, Ti++, and N+ ions with 3% N2 in the gas mixture and at p = 0.7 and 2.7 Pa. Four 
populations coexist for both Ti++ and N+, and their energy distributions are similar to those of Ti+, except that the energies 
of Ti++ ions are doubled. The similarity between Ti+ and Ti++ is obvious because they are generated by the same initial 
source: the sputtering of the target. Assuming that titanium atoms are ejected from the target in a neutral state, some are 
ionized in the high-density plasma to form Ti+, a fraction of which are re-ionized to produce Ti++.

s 

The  similarity  of  the  N+  and  Ti+  distributions  suggests  that  nitrogen  ions  may  be  produced  by  two  main  processes: 
dissociation of the N2  molecules injected into the  gas  mixture and/or sputtering of the  nitride  target. Indeed, nitrogen 
atoms present on the surface of the target are sputtered in the same way as titanium atoms and can then be ionized in the 
plasma  during  transport.  The  very  strong  intensity  of  Pop3  in  the  N+  IEDF,  which  is  predominant  at  low  pressure 
compared to the other populations, suggests that a significant fraction of the N+ ions come from the sputtering.  

Moreover, the number of N+ ions arriving at the aperture (i.e., the ion flux of the time-averaged IEDFs) increases slightly 
with increasing percentage of N2 in the gas (figure 7). Whereas this increase is expected to be proportional to the increase 
in the fraction of N2 as seen on the pop1, the number of N+ ions only increases by a factor of 1.5 from 1 to 15% N2 in the 
gas. This seems to confirm that most of the N+ ions are produced by sputtering. The small observed increase must therefore 
represent the contribution from the plasma due to the dissociation of N2 molecules because the target is quickly saturated 
with nitrogen at only 1% N2, as was previously reported for R-HiPIMS experiments sputtering a Cr target in an Ar/N2 gas 

mixture over relatively long discharge times (200 s) [31,32].

For comparison, Ar+ and N2
+ ions issued from the ionization of the neutral species present permanently in the gas mixture 
have very similar distributions (figure 8). In addition, the TR-IEDFs of these ions are different from those dominantly 
produced by sputtering. Whereas Pop3 is dominant at low pressure (0.7 Pa) for Ti+, N+, and Ti2+, Pop1 is the dominant 
+  and  Ar+  population  under  any  discharge  conditions.  The  IEDFs  of  these  gas  ions  will  be  used  to  discuss  some 
N2
processes behind the physical origin of the four populations. 

III.3. The physical origin of four IEDF populations 

We here discuss the physical origins of the populations highlighted in section III.1 by relying on our mass spectrometry, 

voltage probe, and TR-TDLIF measurements. To better understand the origin of each population, we discuss them in the 
following order: Pop3, Pop2, Pop1, and finally Pop4.

III.3.1. Population 3 (15–50 eV) 

The physical origin of Pop3 has been the subject of several previous works [25,26,33,34]; this population is the most 
complicated  population  to  explain,  especially  in  terms  of  energy,  and  several  explanations  have  been  proposed.  One 

possible explanation is that Pop3 corresponds to the ionization of high-energy neutral atoms (the tail of the Thompson 
distribution [27]). Fast camera footage revealed the formation of structures called ‘spokes’ that turn above the target in 
the azimuthal direction (E⃗⃗  × B⃗⃗ ) [21,22], although the mechanisms generating these structures and their influence on ionic 
transport properties are not yet well understood. Anders et al [35] measured the IEDF of Nb+ ions in a plane close to the 
target by mass spectrometry in two different geometries. By orienting the axis of the mass spectrometer parallel to the 
target surface such that E⃗⃗  × B⃗⃗  pointed towards or away from the detector (i.e., in the r or −r direction, respectively), they 
showed that higher energy ions are preferentially transported in the azimuthal direction (r). They proposed that a ‘double 
layer’ configuration, i.e., an azimuthally asymmetric shape of the potential in the spokes along the racetrack, could explain 

the acceleration of the charged particles in all directions (including the axial direction) and the asymmetry of the IEDFs, 

especially  for  high-energy  ions  (here,  Pop3,  15–50  eV).  This  third  population  has  also  been  attributed  to  fast  ions 
reflecting off of the target [17]. 

Figure 9 shows the IEDFs of Ti+, N+, Ti++, Ar+, and N2
+ at t = 30 µs for two pressures (p = 0.4 and 2.7 Pa), and two 
distances from the target (z = 5 and 12 cm). Except at z = 12 cm and p = 2.7 Pa, Pop3 is detected for all types of ions, 

especially at low pressure (0.4 Pa). However, Maszl et al [26] did not detect Pop3 in gas species in a HiPIMS discharge 

with a relatively long discharge duration of 100 s. If this population were related to the sputtering (Ti and N), it should 
+. Moreover, the average energy of ballistic neutral sputtered titanium atoms decreases 
not be detected for Ar+ and N2
during the post-discharge period; previous works using the same plasma conditions found that the average energy of the 

energetic Ti population decreases from 8 to about 1 eV [14]. This decrease of the average energy of ballistic atoms is not 

due  to  collisions.  By  adopting  a  short  discharge  time  to  clearly  separate  the  sputtering  and  transport  phases,  our 

experiments show that the high-energy atoms (8 eV) crossed the probed volume by t = 5 s, corresponding to the TOF of 

the first high-energy sputtered atoms between the target surface and the probed volume. Similarly, the low-energy atoms 

(1  eV)  crossed  the  probed  volume  by  t  =  25  s,  corresponding  to  the  TOF  of  the  last  low-energy  sputtered  atoms. 

Therefore, the decrease in the average energy of ballistic atoms is mainly due to sputtering. Because this behaviour is not 
observed for the average energy of Pop3 of Ti+, which remains almost constant during the post-discharge period at ~19 
eV for singly charged ions and ~38 eV for doubly charged ions, and  the peaks of Pop3 of Ti+, N+, Ti++, N2
+, and Ar+ can 
only be explained by the acceleration of these ions in the main plasma that produces them.  

Mishra et al [36] used an electron-emitting probe to measure the temporal evolution of the plasma potential along the 

axial direction (z) above the racetrack. They reported a strongly negative plasma potential gradient in the ionization region 
(the region where the electrons are magnetically trapped) at the beginning of the discharge (in the first 6–8 μs). After 55–

60 μs, the plasma potential gradient becomes weak and the bulk electric field collapses. Notably, the potential decreases 
towards the  target.  The same behaviour  was reported by Revel et al  [37] in 2D  particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision 

simulations of HiPIMS plasma  with short discharge  duration.  Thus, if the  Pop3 ions  were  produced in the ionization 

region, they should be attracted by the voltage decrease towards the cathode instead of accelerated towards the grounded 
orifice of the mass spectrometer. We note that these studies were not adapted to predict the effects of spokes on the plasma 

potential. 

As mentioned above, the dense HiPIMS plasma near the target is not homogeneous, and can exhibit one or more spokes 
with a rotational velocity of about 10 km s−1 in the E⃗⃗  × B⃗⃗  azimuthal direction. Recently, Held et al [38] characterized the 
plasma potential inside those structures using time-shift averaging Langmuir probe measurements. They reported that the 

plasma  potential  becomes  higher  inside  a  spoke  than  in  the  surrounding  region,  with  the  measured  potential  in  those 
structures being positive and having a weak gradient. In standard measurements, i.e., without time-shift averaging, they 

found that the plasma potential in the ionisation region becomes more negative when the measurements are performed 

11 

 
close to the target, as also reported elsewhere [36,37]. The plasma potential fluctuations induced by the presence of a 
spoke, from a minimum in the surrounding region to a maximum inside the spoke, are of about 7 V [38]. Anders et al 

[35], who  proposed the  double-layer configuration, predicted potential  fluctuations of ~35 V for HiPIMS spokes and 

suggested that the electric field induced by a spoke in the magnetic trap region could  increase the ion flux towards the 
substrate. 

Our measurements show that Pop3 of singly charged ions has an energy centred at 19 eV and doubly charged ions has an 

energy centred at 38 eV, regardless of the plasma conditions (post-discharge time, pressure, gas mixture). These above 

findings  therefore  suggest  that  only  spokes  and  their  potential  structures  can  generate  such  ion  energies  towards  the 
substrate. The energy of Ti2+ strongly supports the argument that pop3 ions are accelerated by plasma potential inside the 
spokes. Based on these considerations, the average energy of those ions suggests that the potential fluctuations inside the 
spokes are of about 19 V under our plasma conditions. The flux of Pop3 (the mass spectrometer signal) thus depends on 

the gas pressure and the distance from the target. 

Three  effects  can  modify  the  Pop3  signal:  the  acceptance  angle  of  the  mass  spectrometer,  a  geometric  effect,  and 

thermalization with the background gas (a pressure effect). 

•  Acceptance angle. As described in the experimental setup, the mass spectrometer orifice is in front of the centre 
of the target. The sputtering occurs mainly in the racetrack, and the ionization of sputtered particles occurs in the 

ionization  region.  An  ion  produced  in  this  region  arrives  at  the  mass  spectrometer  orifice  at  an  angle  θ, 

where tan(𝜃) ≈

𝑅0
𝑧−𝑧0

, R0 = 1.25 cm, and z0 ≈ 1 cm (figure 10). For z = 5 and 12 cm, θ is 16° and 6.1°, respectively. 

Thus, with increasing distance z, the likelihood that these ions are measured by the mass spectrometer increases 

[39]. 

•  Geometrical  effect.  The  Pop3  ions  are  produced  in  the  ionization  region  above  the  racetrack  and,  ideally, 

transported uniformly in all directions. Therefore, Pop3 ions spread in a sphere and their flux should decrease as 
the area of the sphere (S = 4π × [R0

2 + (z − z0)2)] increases (figure 10). 

•  Pressure effect. When the product  of  pressure  ×  distance is increased, ions  undergo  more collisions  with the 

buffer gas, inducing a decrease of the Pop3 signal.

At low pressure (0.4 Pa), i.e., when collisions between particles are limited, our time-resolved measurements of Ti+, N+, 
and Ti++ show that Pop3 is the dominant population, whatever the distance from the target (z = 5 and 12 cm) (figure 10). 
At higher pressure (2.7 Pa), the signals of Pop1, Pop2, and Pop3 are comparable at z = 5 cm, whereas the signal of Pop3 
decreases  drastically  at  z  = 12  cm.  Regarding  Ar+  and  N2
+,  the  contribution  of  Pop1  clearly  dominates,  whatever  the 
measurement conditions. These  results  indicate that  Pop3 ions are  highly affected by thermalization  during  collisions

spectrometer (figure 10) does not significantly alter the Pop3 signal intensity in our experiments, although this effect is 

well observed closer to the target (z = 2–4 cm).

III.3.2. Population 2 (4–15 eV) 

Although we detected ions of Pop2 at 0–15 eV, it is difficult to distinguish them from Pop1 due to the overlap of these 
two populations between 0 and 4 eV. Therefore, we restricted our analysis of Pop2 to 4–15 eV, as shown in figure 3. The 

production of Pop2 ions is  greater under higher discharge  pressure (2.7 Pa; top  panels of figure 11), and  the  average 

energy of Pop2 decreases with increasing pressure and distance from the target (bottom panels of figure 11). Because the 
intensity of Pop2 increases  with discharge pressure  whereas that of  Pop3 decreases (figure 4), and because it is  well 

known that the collisional process depends on pressure and the distance from the target, a part of Pop3 and Pop4 must 
feed some portion of Pop2 through collisions with the gas. 

Pop2 is intermediate between Pop3 and Pop1, which is equivalent to the quasi-thermalized atoms (QTH) detected in TR-
TDLIF measurements of neutral Ti atoms  [14]. A second process could  therefore  also contribute to  the  generation of 
Pop2. This process concerns the recombination of Ti++ ions with electrons to become Ti+ or the charge exchange between 
Ti++ and argon atoms, as discussed by Hecimovic and Ehiasarian [27] for Cr++ and Cr+ ions. Nonetheless, the ionization 
potential  of  Ti+  is  13.57  eV  and  that  of  Ar  atoms  is  15.76 eV.  Therefore,  the  energy  defect  for  the  charge  exchange 
between these species is −2.2 eV, and this process can be ruled out. Comparing the IEDFs of titanium in figure 9, it is 
apparent that Pop2 of Ti+ and Ti++ have the same energy (between 4 and 15 eV), whereas Pop3 and Pop4 of Ti++ are twice 
as energetic those of Ti+. This indicates that the recombination Ti+ with electrons directly feeds Pop2 of Ti+ in the 0–15 
eV  energy  range,  even  if  no  Ti++  ions  have  energies  of  15–30  eV.  Nevertheless,  this  process  seems  minor  under  our 
conditions, and the signal of Pop2 of Ti++ ions is a decade smaller than that of Ti+ ions.

different pressures and z = 5 cm (left) and 12 cm (right), PHiPIMS = 350 W cm−2, and in a pure Ar gas. 

III.3.3. Population 1, thermalized ions (0–4 eV) 

Because Pop1 is detectable during the entire post-discharge period (1 ms), there are two possible processes that could 

lead to its generation: the ionization of thermalized neutral (TH) atoms or the thermalization of fast ions from other, more 

energetic populations (Pop2–4) during transport. 

At 2.7 Pa, two peaks are observed in the signal of Pop1 of Ti+  (figure 12): the first at t ~ 40 µs, just after the discharge, 
and the second shortly after, at t ~ 116 µs. At lower pressures (0.4 and 0.7 Pa), the first peak does not appear. To better 
understand the process producing ions of Pop1, figure 13a compares the Ti+ IEDF at t = 36 µs with its corresponding fit 
obtained using a shifted Maxwellian distribution function [29] 

                                                                     𝑓(𝐸) ∝ 𝑔(𝐸) exp  (−

where Tions is the ion temperature and Eshift mainly represents the energy gained by ions in the sheath in front of the mass 
spectrometer. Because the orifice of the mass spectrometer is grounded in our experiments,  Eshift represents the plasma 
potential, assuming a collisionless sheath. The prefactor g(E) depends on the acceptance angle of the mass spectrometer, 
which should be constant in our experiments [29]. At t = 36 µs, the fit to our data indicates that the ion temperature of 
Pop1  is  around  1100  K  and  that  Pop1  is  shifted  (EShift)  by  about  2.5  eV.  Given  that  the  mass  spectrometer  orifice  is 
grounded, this energy shift indicates that the plasma potential at z = 5 cm is about +2.5 V, consistent with previous results 

[36,37]. In the velocity distribution function of neutral Ti atoms measured previously by TR-TDLIF (figure 13b), three 
groups of atoms were identified: TH, QTH, and EN atoms [14]. TH atoms have a Maxwellian velocity distribution centred 
at an axial velocity of 0 m s−1 and a temperature around 800 K. At t = 36 s, Tions of Pop1 and the temperature of TH 
atoms are similar. One could estimate that the 300-K discrepancy between the temperatures represents the errors on the 
measurement and the fit. The error seems generated mainly from the variation of plasma potential during the acquisition 
time of TR-IEDFs in which was a gate of 20 μs. The Pop1 peak of Ar+ at t = t = 36 s was also fitted with the shifted

equilibrium at 2.7 Pa, 5 cm from the target, and t ≥ 36 s.

Neutral Ti velocity distribution function measured by TR-TDLIF at t = 36 s. Discharge conditions: p = 2.7 Pa, z = 5 cm, PHiPIMS =

In addition, the temporal evolution of the flux of thermalized neutral Ti atoms (TH) toward the substrate (i.e. we took 
only atoms with positive velocity in z-direction) at p = 2.7 Pa is plotted in figure 14. At the end of the post-discharge 

period (t = 1000 s), residual thermalized neutral atoms remain in the measurement volume and are detected again at the 

beginning of the next discharge (TH (t = 0 s) = TH (t = 1000 s); black dashed line for z = 5 cm in figure 14). The 
transport of TH atoms is diffusive, and any losses caused by this process are very weak at the relatively high magnetron 

pressure  of  2.7  Pa.  At  the  beginning  of  the  pulse,  TH  decreases  faster  than  at  the  end  of  the  post-discharge  period, 
reaching a minimum value at t = 30 µs, when the newly produced TH atoms are observed in the probed volume. We note 
that this time is close to that corresponding to the maximum of the first peak of Pop1 of Ti+. 

These results seem to show that Pop1 ions are produced by the very first Ti+ ion generation process: the ionization of 
residual thermal neutral atoms remaining from the previous post-discharge period. Indeed, at lower pressure, much fewer

TH atoms are generated by collisions with the buffer gas, and their diffusive transport (loss) is faster. Therefore, at 0.7 
and 0.4 Pa, fewer residual TH atoms remain at the end of the post-discharge period, and their ionization by the subsequent 

discharge (the first peak of Pop1) is less obvious. 

The second peak in the temporal evolution of Pop1 (figure 12) may simply be a low-energy portion of Pop2; it appears 

~100 s after the end of the discharge, when the electron energy is not enough to efficiently ionize the thermalized vapor. 

Therefore, these ions could correspond to the thermalization of energetic ions, as discussed in section III.3.2.

measured by TR-TDLIF [14] at different distances from the target, p = 2.7 Pa, R0 = 1.3 cm, PHiPIMS = 350 W cm−2, and in pure Ar gas. 
The corresponding density of thermalized atoms at these plasma conditions is in the order of 109 cm-3. 

III.3.4. Population 4 (50–100 eV) 

To  better  understand  the  physical  origin  of  the  population  of  very  highly  energetic  ions,  we  measured  the  temporal 

evolution of the cathode voltage using a high-voltage probe with a large bandwidth. A measurement at 2.7 Pa and in pure 

Ar gas is shown in figure 15. At the end of the discharge, four peaks of positive voltage appear between 12 and 14 μs. 
These  peaks  are  real,  and  are  not  due  to  the  electrical  noise  generated  by  the  high  power  (as  at  the  beginning  of  the 

discharge). Indeed, if they were simply electrical noise, they would appear as soon as the discharge was turned off (i.e., 

at 10 s) and oscillate around the grounded voltage reference, alternating between positive and negative values. These 

positive peaks in the cathode voltage are thus capable of repelling positive ions and attracting electrons. This characteristic 

is certainly specific to our generator and is probably how the manufacturer allowed working with short pulses, i.e., by 
pushing positive charges near the cathode. We note that these peaks disappear when the discharge duration is increased. 

Keraudy et al. [40] studied the ion energy distribution in bipolar HiPIMS discharges, in which a positive voltage pulse 

follows the high-power impulse to explore the influence of a long positive-voltage pulse (200 s) in the range 10–150 V. 

Their mass spectrometry results clearly showed that a large proportion of metal ions is accelerated with an energy that 
corresponds to the positive voltage. Thus, they interpreted that those ions came from the region very close to the target, 

where the ions were repelled by the positive cathode voltage. 

Pop4 is well observed at ~2.7 Pa, but is attenuated at lower pressure (~0.4 Pa; figure 16). In addition, the second and third 

positive-voltage peaks (~100 V in the inset of figure 15) are very close to the energy of Pop4, about 90 eV (top panel, 
figure  16).  This  small  10-eV  difference  could  be  explained  by  thermalization  during  ion  transport  into  the  mass 

spectrometer. Furthermore, this population is not observed in DC discharges. These findings seem to confirm that the 
ions of Pop4 are accelerated by the positive cathode voltage.

Finally, the variations of Pop4 of Ti+ ions as functions of pressure and distance (figure 17) are similar to those observed 
for Pop1 and Pop2. In fact, the generation of Pop4, especially metallic ions, is favoured when the operating conditions 

allow the production of enough thermalized ions in the vicinity of the target; if the operating conditions can only produce 

Pop3 ions, they cannot be accelerated by the positive cathode voltage because they are already moving away very quickly 
at the beginning of the post-discharge period. It thus seems that Pop4 is mainly due to the acceleration of thermalized 
+ and Ar+ even at 0.4 
ions, namely those of Pop1. This may explain why Pop4 ions are observed in the TR-IEDFs of N2
Pa (figure 8).

IV. Conclusions 

This work is mainly devoted to characterizing the transport of metal ions (Ti+ and Ti++) and ions produced from the buffer 
gas  (N+,  Ar+,  and  N2
+)  during  the  HiPIMS  process.  Time-resolved  mass  spectrometry  measurements  of  ion  energy 
distribution functions (TR-IEDFs) revealed four populations (Pop1, Pop2, Pop3, and Pop4) that vary depending on the 
working  conditions  (pressure,  percentage  of  nitrogen  in  the  Ar/N2  gas  mixture,  and  distance  from  the  target).  The 
variations of Ti+ populations as  a function of  the  percentage of N2 reveal the same behaviour observed for neutral Ti 
atoms,  i.e.,  a  strong  decrease  in  the  flux  when  only  1%  N2  is  added  to  the  argon  gas,  but  no  variation  at  greater  N2 
percentages. Thus, at >1% N2, the percentage of N2 in the reactive gas does not modify the production of metallic ions. 
This behaviour can therefore be explained by our working conditions, particularly the relatively low HiPIMS power (350 
W cm−2) chosen for the TR-TDLIF measurements and the  short discharge time (10 μs), which does not allow  for the 
sufficient removal of the nitride layer formed on the target surface. 

Our comparison and analysis of the IEDFs of Ti+, Ti++, and N+ as a function of the fraction of N2 in the gas indicate that 
most of the neutral N atoms are produced by the sputtering of the nitride layer on the target, with just a small portion 

being produced by the dissociation of nitrogen molecules in the plasma. 

We explored the physical origins of the four observed ion populations. Pop1 is produced by the ionization of thermalized 

neutral atoms. Pop3 is the original ion population; at low pressures where collisions with the gas are limited, only Pop3 
can be detected by mass spectrometry. This population thus seems to be generated by spokes. Pop2 is mainly generated 

by collisions between the ions of Pop3 (and probably Pop4) and the buffer gas during transport, but may also result from 
the recombination of electrons and doubly ionized ions. Pop4 seems to be produced by the specific features of our HiPIMS 

generator;  positive  peaks  in  the  cathode  voltage  that  appear  when  short-duration  HiPIMS  discharges  are  turned  off 

accelerate ions of Pop1 (and probably Pop2) present in the vicinity of the cathode, similar to a bipolar HiPIMS process.
