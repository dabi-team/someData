Abstract

To achieve appropriate interaction rates in recent neutrino oscillation studies, high atomic number

nuclear targets were utilized. Because of the nuclear eﬀects in the experimental observable, the

utilization of these complicated targets produced systematic uncertainties that needed to be assessed

accurately to constrain the discovery. We made an eﬀort to calculate the nuclear eﬀects in the Ar and

H targets, which are intended to be employed at the DUNE distant and near detectors, respectively,

through our simulation eﬀort. The DUNE ﬂux is peaking around 2.5 GeV and CCRES is the

dominant process at this energy. So, this work will be focused only on the CCQE and CCRES

interactions and the simulations will be done using two diﬀerent neutrino event generators. We

reported the ratio of the oscillation probability (P(Ar)/P(H) as a function of reconstructed neutrino

energy for CCRES channels to quantify the systematic errors in the observables.

Keywords: Nuclear eﬀects, Uncertainties, Final State Interactions, Survival probability.

Introduction

DUNE will be a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment [1–4]. The important research goal of this experiment

is constraining the CP violation phase in the leptonic sector [5] and to determine the parameters governing neutrino

oscillation. Another goal of the DUNE project is to determine the mass hierarchy, whether it is an inverted hierarchy

(IH) or a normal hierarchy (NH), which is currently unknown, as well as atmospheric neutrino physics, supernova

physics [6], and proton decay physics [7]. DUNE will be a neutrino and anti-neutrino spectrum (νµ( ¯νµ), νe( ¯νe),

and ντ ( ¯ντ )) beam facility at Fermilab, with a near detector (ND) near the neutrino source at Fermilab and a far

detector (FD) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, USA. This will give a 1248-

kilometer baseline facility for studying the matter eﬀect. To study the neutrino spectrum, both detectors will use Ar

target material, which will enable to overcome numerous systematic errors. The ND will look at the spectra of un-

oscillated neutrinos, whereas the FD will look at the spectrum of oscillated neutrinos. DUNE chose to use the PRISM

concept in ND, which suggested that two detectors be used, one on-axis and the other traveling across the beam.

On a daily basis, the beam stability is monitored using the System for on-Axis Neutrino Detection (SAND). SAND

employed a hydrocarbon target and ν(¯ν)-H from CH2 subtraction, which provides useful information for reducing

systematic uncertainty [8]. The precise energy measurement of each ﬂavor at both detectors is critical for completing

the experiment’s scientiﬁc purpose. The events rate as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy at both the ND

and FD detectors, which are used to constrain values of the neutrino oscillation parameters and also proton lifetime

measurement, are compared to measure oscillation probabilities as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy. These

uncertainties make determining the CP-violating phase, which has yet to be constrained, a serious task. Precise CP

phase values are important not only for conﬁrming the universe’s baryon asymmetry but also for describing phenomena

outside the standard model, such as the eﬀective mass of neutrinos [9].

Neutrinos are large (very small mass) weakly interacting particles that only interact with matter very seldom. It

is quite diﬃcult to detect them in regular detectors due to their weakly interacting nature. In comparison to other

baseline neutrino experiment detectors, the DUNE collaboration’s proposed detector is an exceedingly advanced

detector of this generation. This versatile DUNE detector will be built in a modular format, with each module

containing unique technologies capable of detecting neutrino occurrences and other unusual phenomena. The charged

current (CC) and neutral current (NC) processes interact with neutrinos. In the ﬁnal stages, an interactive event
with the CC process created leptons (e+, e−, µ+, µ−, τ +, τ −) corresponding to neutrino ﬂavors (νe, ¯νe, νµ, ¯νµ, ντ , ¯ντ )

and hadrons.

In our Monte Carlo (MC) sample, interaction events with the NC create the same neutrino ﬂavor

and hadrons in the ﬁnal states. The primary CC processes include CC-Quasi-Elastic (QE), Resonance (RES), Deep

Inelastic Scattering (DIS), and Meson Exchange Current (MEC), which are all modeled based on neutrino energy.

The cross-sections of these CC interaction mechanisms are energy-dependent. The investigation of these neutrino-

nucleus interactions in the nuclear medium become more diﬃcult. The neutrinos interact with the nucleons inside

the target nucleus to form secondary leptons and hadrons in these scattering processes. Because these nucleons are

not non-interacting, nuclear eﬀects must be taken into account when researching the physics of neutrino-nucleon

interactions. To boost interaction rates, recent neutrino experiments have used material with a high atomic number

as detector materials, which has increased systematic uncertainty in neutrino reconstruction energy due to nuclear

eﬀects. Uncertainties from the multi-nuclear correlation, nuclear Fermi motion eﬀects, binding energy, and ﬁnal-state

interactions (FSI) of created hadrons in distinct interaction channels are all major nuclear eﬀects present in nuclear

targets. At both the momentum transferred distribution and the double diﬀerential cross-sections, the fermionic

motion of the nucleons, as well as the Pauli blocking mechanism, have distinct and noticeable impacts. Furthermore,

it was discovered that the nucleon separation energy has a signiﬁcant impact on the momentum transferred distribution

[10]. The need for precise neutrino oscillation parameter knowledge is inﬂuenced by several factors, the most important

of which is the correct reconstruction of neutrino energy. The likelihood of neutrino oscillation is based on neutrino

energy, and any inaccuracy in neutrino energy measurement will aﬀect neutrino oscillation parameter measurements

because it generates uncertainty in cross-section measurement and event identiﬁcation. The electron scattering (e-

A) data or a simple target like neutrino-hydrogen scattering (ν(¯ν)-H) data can be used to constrain these kinds of

systematic errors. We are running a simulation using the latter option to see how many systematic uncertainties there

are in the measurable energy when utilizing the Ar target.

Aside from the systematic uncertainties in the observables due to uncertainty in total neutrino cross-sections [11],

the secondary particles that emerge from the nucleus after the ﬁnal FSI also contribute to systematic inaccuracies

[12, 13]. One of the key reasons is that the nucleons in the target nucleus are neither at rest nor non-interacting. Recent

experiments with intense neutrino beams have resulted in a signiﬁcant gain in statistics and a reduction in statistical

uncertainty. These tests now emphasize the importance of managing systematic uncertainty with caution. Neutrino

experiments of this generation use a complex nuclear target for interaction, resulting in signiﬁcant and non-negligible

nuclear eﬀects. When modeling neutrino scattering events, most neutrino experiments use the Impulse Approximation

[14] or the Fermi Gas Model [15] to account for nuclear eﬀects. Following the results of several neutrino tests conducted

in various energy ranges, recent experiments have shown that nuclear impacts must be properly considered. Neutrino

experiments like MiniBooNE [16] and MicroBooNE [17] that used lower energy neutrino beams are only sensitive to

two types of neutrino interactions: QE and RES.

In these studies, pion generation accounts for only one-third of the overall neutrino-nucleon interaction cross-section.

The nuclear binding energy, Fermi motion, and Pauli blocking are key eﬀects that appear mostly at neutrino energies

below

∼

0.5 GeV [18]. The pion generation grows to two-thirds of the overall cross-section [19] as we progress towards

higher energy neutrino beam experiments like NOvA, MINERvA, and DUNE. As a result, it is critical to thoroughly

quantify the pion production routes under strict quantitative control. The ﬁnal state interactions of hadrons, which

are created in the reaction together with leptons, are one of the most important nuclear processes that cause fake

events [20]. Due to numerous processes such as elastic and charge exchange scattering with the nucleons that exist

in the nucleus through strong interactions, pions formed in neutrino-nucleon interactions can be absorbed, change

direction, energy, or charge, or even make new pions. As a result, depending on the emerging particles from the

nucleus, bogus events occur. In this work, we calculated the contribution of nuclear eﬀects (ﬁnal state interaction)

in resonance channels using neutrino oscillation parameters at DUNE, focusing on the relevance of having a good

understanding of pion generation channels in higher energy neutrino beam investigations. Figure 1 shows the number

of pions in the left panel and the number of nucleons in the right panel for RES processes for Ar (upper part) and H

(lower part) target.

We propose a simulation-based analysis employing two neutrino event generators, GENIE and NuWro, in this

paper. We can also perform this analysis by using MARLEY, a novel event generator developed to better satisfy

the modeling demands of the low-energy neutrino community (tens of MeV and lower) [21]. This simulation study

is done for the DUNE project, however, similar impacts can be checked for any baseline experiment. The purpose of

any baseline experiment is to quantify the neutrino oscillation probability; here, we’ve done a simulation of what the

DUNE baseline and detectors are intended to observe. This analysis is carried out with the target materials Argon

(Ar), which will be used in both the ND and FD detectors and then with hydrogen, which will be utilized in the near

 
 
 
 
4

detector complex to measure the DUNE neutrino ﬂux, with all other parameters remaining the same. So, we will have

two kinds of MC event samples one with Ar target and the second one with H target. Neutrino energy is reconstructed

using a calorimetric method that used all the particles and kinematics available in the ﬁnal states. Argon, Iron, and

Carbon as a target was extensively used in recent neutrino detectors, therefore this study will help in the estimation

of the systematic uncertainties with the experimental data and model development. The measurable probability as a

function of reconstructed neutrino energy is used to estimate the systematic uncertainties. The number of systematic

inaccuracies in events with the Ar target due to the available nuclear eﬀects in the models used to explain neutrino

Ar scattering is approximated as the ratio of probability as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy P(Ar)/P(H).

The following sections comprise the paper: Section 2 describes the neutrino event generators GENIE and NuWro

employed in this study, as well as a detailed comparison of the nuclear model integrated into them. The ﬂux and

oscillation physics are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the detector eﬀect and neutrino energy reconstruction

then results and discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we provide our conclusions.

2. EVENT generators: GENIE and NuWro

Event generators are used to produce events at detectors so that simulation-based ﬁndings can be generated for

any experiment to gain an understanding of the predicted observables. Neutrino communities have event generators

with built-in models that are modiﬁed based on experimental data, and these generators serve as a link between

experimental and theoretical physicists. To conduct our research, we chose the two most widely used neutrino event

generators: GENIE (Generates Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments) v3.0.6 [22] and NuWro [23] version 19.01,

which are currently used by the majority of neutrino experiments in the United States and other countries. Many

neutrino baseline experiments across the world employ GENIE, including Minerva [24], MINOS [25], MicroBooNE [17],

NoVA [26], and ArgoNEUT [27] experiments. Most neutrino experiments currently employ NuWro as a supplemental

neutrino events generator, thanks to a group of physicists led by Cezary Juszczak et al. at Wroclaw University [23].

GENIE was created with a focus on scattering in the few GeV energy range, which is critical for current and future

oscillation studies experiments, while NuWro covers the neutrino energy scale from 100 MeV to 100 GeV. NuWro’s

core design is based on well-known MCs such as NEUT [28] and GENIE [22]. It controls all key neutrino-nucleus

interactions, as well as DIS hadronization and the intranuclear cascade. NuWro is a tool for estimating the signiﬁcance

of various theoretical models that are currently being studied. NuWro is built around an event framework that has

three types of particle vectors:

incoming, transient, and departing. GENIE is a modern and adaptable neutrino

event simulation platform. The methods considered for neutrino-nucleus interaction processes in both generators

and the general technique employed for dealing with neutrino-nucleus interaction analyses. The Relativistic Fermi

gas (RFG) model is used in GENIE, which is based on the model proposed by A. Bodek and J.L. Ritche [29], but

the Local Fermi gas (LFG) model is used in NuWro. In both generators, the Llewellyn Smith model [30] is used

to model QE scattering. GENIE and NuWro use the newest BBBA07 [31] and BBBA05 [32] vector form factors,
respectively. GENIE employs a variable axial mass MA of 0.99-1.2 GeV /c2, whereas NuWro employs a variable axial
mass of 0.94-1.03 GeV /c2. We employed the axial mass MA=1 GeV /c2 in our research. In GENIE, ∆ contribution

and other resonance modes were examined separately using the Rein-Sehgal model [33], but in NuWro, we only have

3. DUNE ﬂux and oscillation probability

We have generated an inclusive MC sample of 1 million events at the ND site using this ﬂux for each target (Ar

and H) for further performing the simulation and analysis, which will be discussed in the following sections. This ﬂux

is also folded with the oscillation probability to get the ﬂux at the FD site shown in Figure 2, again the folded ﬂux is

used to get the similar at the FD site. The oscillation probability used here is represented by equation 1 and the true

set of values of the oscillation parameters [37] considered in this analysis are presented in Table I. One can see that the

4. Detector eﬀects and energy reconstruction

DUNE at Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will be consist of ND and FD with similar target material but

the diﬀerence in dimension and technology. The ND system will be located at Fermilab, 574 m downstream and 60 m

underground [37] from the neutrino beam source point. The baseline design of the DUNE ND [38] system comprises of

three main components: (1) A 50t LArTPC called ArgonCube with pixellated readout; (2) A multi-purpose tracker,

the high-pressure gaseous argon TPC (HPgTPC), kept in a 0.5T magnetic ﬁeld and surrounded by electromagnetic

calorimeter (ECAL), together called the multi-purpose detector (MPD); (3) and an on-axis beam monitor called

System for on-Axis Neutrino Detection (SAND). SAND [2] will consist of an Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL),

a superconducting solenoid magnet, a thin active Lar target, a 3D scintillator tracker (3DST) as an active neutrino

target, and a Low-density tracker to precisely measure particles escaping from the scintillator. The FD (and the

similar ND) has to be made of heavy nuclei rather than hydrogen is the main source of complication. The primary

goal of SAND is constraining systematic uncertainties from nuclear eﬀects. For a better understanding of nuclear

eﬀects in neutrino-nucleus interactions, it is useful to examine what would happen if the detectors were made of

hydrogen because in a detector made of hydrogen, the initial state is a proton at rest and there is no FSI. The 40

kt DUNE FD will comprise of four separate LArTPC detector modules, each with a ﬁducial volume (FV) of at least

10 kt, installed

∼

1.5 km underground at the SURF [39]. The internal dimensions 15.1 m (w)

(l) of each LArTPC ﬁts inside an FV containing a total LAr mass of about 17.5 kt. Detailed detector simulation

and reconstruction analysis is done by the DUNE-collaboration that can be found in detail in reference [37, 40], we

have applied the same detector eﬃciency and resolution for the particles available in the FSI while reconstructing the

neutrino energy in our analysis.

For accurate oscillation analysis, the reconstruction of neutrino energy from the kinematics of the particles available

in the FSI is of prime importance. This energy has to be reconstructed on an event-by-event basis because the neutrino

beams are generated via secondary decay of primarily produced hadrons which assign a broad range of energies to

the neutrinos. We can make use of either of the two schemes for neutrino energy reconstruction i.e., (1) Kinematic

method [16, 41–43]; (2) Calorimetric method [44, 45]. The kinematic method of energy reconstruction is based on

the premise that the incoming neutrino interacts with a single nucleon which is assumed to be at rest, bound with

constant energy, and the outgoing particles include a single nucleon i.e., no other nucleons are knocked out of the

nucleus and a lepton. As the energy of the incoming neutrino increases, the contribution of inelastic processes-RES,

and DIS becomes dominant and may lead to many hadrons in the ﬁnal state thus leading to inappropriate estimation of

neutrino energy reconstruction. Thus this method is largely used by lower energy experiments, such as MiniBooNE [16]

and T2K [12]. The calorimetric method of neutrino energy reconstruction demands information of all the detectable

ﬁnal state particles on an event-by-event basis i.e., a total of the energy deposited by all reaction products in the

detector and thus permitting for precise reconstruction of neutrino energy. It is appropriate for all types of events,

unlike the kinematic method which is only applicable for QE event reconstruction. Still, this method gives rise to

challenges in the way of true neutrino energy reconstruction. The main challenges are the precise reconstruction of

all produced hadrons, where neutrons are assumed to escape detection completely. Thus, the calorimetric method

relies on the capability of detector design and performance in reconstructing ﬁnal states. Nuclear eﬀects also play an

important role in incorrect neutrino reconstructed energy as they may promote a signiﬁcant amount of missing energy,

the energy that gets absorbed in the intermediate state interactions before the ﬁnal states particles come out of the

nucleus, obstructing the reconstruction of neutrino energy [45]. For example, if a meson produced at the initial state is

absorbed in the observer system, in general, its energy is not deposited in the calorimeter. The neutrino reconstructed

in Appendix Figure 8 and Figure 9 for QE and RES process respectively, this is the mean neutrino energy at which

DUNE ﬂux will be peaking.

5. Results and discussion

We should have a good understanding of the hadronic physics of neutrino-nucleus interactions since it is critical to

understand nuclear eﬀects. The information about the energy dependence of all exclusive cross-sections and nuclear

eﬀects is important for the construction of a nuclear model. Any ignorance of theoretical uncertainties in the nuclear

models while simulating results cost inaccuracy. We use diﬀerent event generators, which are built upon these nuclear

models to test results from the neutrino oscillation experiments. These predict the neutrino-nucleus interaction rates

for a speciﬁc nuclear target along with the topology of ﬁnal state particles which is crucial for oscillation analysis.

With the use of complex targets, nuclear eﬀects play a vital role in the prediction of neutrino oscillation physics.

Diﬀerent generators use diﬀerent approximations to measure the nuclear eﬀects giving rise to diﬀerent results. Our

analysis of nuclear eﬀects in this work reﬂects the extent of uncertainty in the physics of the selected neutrino event

generators. The QE and RES interaction channels are analyzed in this article.

From Figure 1, we observe that the average number of pions and nucleons in the ﬁnal states are signiﬁcantly

diﬀerent in both generators. The understanding of this diﬀerence in number is more complicated for the bigger target

materials (Ar) compared to the smaller target materials (H). The actually produced mesons or another secondary

at the vertex into the nuclear environment are easily get absorbed or have further interactions within the nucleus.

This leads to the misidentiﬁcation of the events channel process from the original channels process produced. This

diﬀerence can not be underestimated and it reﬂects the lack of understanding of the theoretical models or nuclear

physics that are recently being used in generators to describe the ﬁnal states interactions and their hadronization.

This is the major systematic error available in the theoretical model that causes the wrongly reconstructed neutrino

energy. Due to this incomplete understanding of theoretical models available in the generators that are being used in

experiments to tune the data are not suﬃcient to explain the scattering and cross-sections. Many theoretical physics

groups have tried to deﬁne the nuclear medium in the diﬀerent neutrino event generators to overcome this problem

but more physics input is required to attend to this problem properly. The miss-reconstructed neutrino energy is the

major cause of systematic uncertainties in cross-sections measurements at the neutrino experiments. The theoretical

cross-section models for the energy range of ﬂux planned at the DUNE project with the NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main

Injector) beam is still not very well developed and must be well developed to achieve the kind of accuracy is needed

to be achieved the required goal. This work will help to get some systematic uncertainties available in the models.

The DUNE neutrino beam below 1 GeV, QE scattering is the main mode of neutrino-nucleon interaction but as we

increase energy, the RES and DIS processes rule the QE interactions. As we see neutrino beam peaks around 2.5 GeV

and in this energy region RES production is the dominant which mainly results in the production of pions. In Figure

3 and Figure 4, where total event distribution is shown as a function of true and reconstructed energy for QE and

RES processes respectively for νµ, we can see for QE processes, there is not much diﬀerence but for RES processes

there is little diﬀerence for energy from 0.125-1.5 GeV and 3-7 GeV in both generators.

One can extrapolate the oscillation probability by taking the ratio of events at FD to the events at ND [46]. The

result is shown in Figure 5, both as a function of true and reconstructed neutrino energy for QE processes (left) and

RES processes (right) for Ar target. For quantifying the nuclear eﬀects in the Ar (A=40) target, which is going to be

used in the DUNE detector, we use a small target like H which will be used in the SAND detector that has the least

nuclear eﬀects since it has only one nucleon. Figure 6 shows the survival probability for H target for the RES channel

as a function of reconstruction and true neutrino energy. The ratio of the probability distribution of Ar/H is shown in

Figure 7 which gives us an idea about nuclear eﬀects are available in the Ar target concerning the Hydrogen for RES

events. In the Figure, we can see that there is a deviation from the unity which means large systematic uncertainty

in the generators.

6. Conclusions

We should have a good understanding of the hadronic physics of neutrino-nucleus interactions since it is critical to

understand nuclear eﬀects. The information about the energy dependence of all exclusive cross-sections and nuclear

eﬀects is important for the construction of a nuclear model. Any ignorance of theoretical uncertainties in the nuclear

models while simulating results cost inaccuracy. We use diﬀerent event generators, which are built upon these nuclear

models to test results from the neutrino oscillation experiments. These predict the neutrino-nucleon interaction rates

for a speciﬁc nuclear target along with the topology of ﬁnal state particles which is crucial for oscillation analysis.

With the use of complex targets, nuclear eﬀects play a vital role in the prediction of neutrino oscillation physics.

Diﬀerent generators use diﬀerent approximations to measure the nuclear eﬀects giving rise to diﬀerent results. Our

analysis of nuclear eﬀects in this work reﬂects the extent of uncertainty in the physics of the selected neutrino event

generators. The QE and RES interaction channels are analyzed in this article.
