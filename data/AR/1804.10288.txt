Abstract

A detector has been constructed for measuring ion mobilities of gas mixtures at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The
detector consists of a standard triple GEM ampliﬁcation region and a drift region where ions drift. A method has been developed
to measure the ions’ arrival time at a cathode wire-grid by diﬀerentiating the recorded signals on this electrode. Simulations prove
that this method is accurate and robust. The ion mobility in diﬀerent gas mixtures is measured while applying diﬀerent drift ﬁeld
values ranging from 200 V cm−1 to 1100 V cm−1.

From an extrapolation of a Blanc’s law ﬁt to measurements in Ar-CO2 mixtures we ﬁnd the reduced mobility of the drifting
(cluster) ion species in pure argon to be 1.94 ± 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 and in pure carbon-dioxide to be 1.10 ± 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. Applying
the same procedure to our measurements in Ne-CO2 yields 4.06 ± 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.09 ± 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the reduced
mobilities in pure neon and carbon-dioxide, respectively.

Admixtures of N2 to Ne-CO2 (90-10) reduce somewhat the mobility. For the baseline gas mixture of the future ALICE Time

Projection Chamber, Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5), the measured reduced mobility of the drifting ions is 2.92 ± 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Ion mobilities are examined for diﬀerent water content ranging from 70 ppm to about 2000 ppm in the gas using Ar-CO2 (90-10)

and Ne-CO2 (90-10). A slight decrease of ion mobility is observed for the addition of several hundred ppm of water.

1. Introduction

The ion mobility (K) is the factor relating the drift velocity
(vDrift) of ions to the drift ﬁeld (EDrift): vDrift = K · EDrift [1].
Under high particle loads, i.e. on the order of several nA cm−2
reaching the readout plane, ions can accumulate in the drift vol-
ume of a gaseous detector. These ions produce a large space
charge distorting the drift ﬁeld. Such distortions and their pos-
sible mitigation have been and are studied by many experiments
as e.g. the current ALICE Time Projection Chamber [2] (TPC)
[3], the upgraded ALICE TPC [4, 5] and the LCTPC [6, 7]. If
K is known, it is possible to estimate and simulate this space
charge and to evaluate the impact of the back drifting ions on
the performance of a detector.

Mobilities of ions in their parent gases (e.g. Ne+ in neon)
have been measured extensively, cf. [8, 9, 10, 11], but the mo-
bility of an ion species in a gas mixture diﬀers from its mobility
in the parent gas. With this study we provide ion mobilities for
diﬀerent gas mixtures commonly used in gaseous detectors and
in particular we measure the mobility in the gas mixture of the
upgraded ALICE TPC, Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5) [5].

To measure the ion drift velocity a dedicated set-up is con-
structed, which is described in Section 2. The principle of the

measurements and the signal analysis procedure follow in Sec-
tion 3. In Section 3.1 we describe our method to determine the
ions’ time of arrival at the end of the drift gap and we demon-
strate with simulations that the method is accurate and robust.
Afterwards the measurement of the signal indicating that the
ions started to drift (Sec. 3.4) and the diﬀerent uncertainties
aﬀecting the mobility measurements (Sec. 4.1) are discussed.
The ion mobility found for diﬀerent Ar-CO2 and Ne-CO2 gas
mixtures are presented as a function of EDrift (Sec. 4.2) and as
function of the quencher content in the gas mixture (Sec. 4.3).
Furthermore the eﬀect of admixtures of N2 to Ne-CO2 (90-10)
is examined (Sec. 4.4) and the eﬀect of water on the ion mobil-
ity is studied using Ar-CO2 (90-10) and Ne-CO2 (90-10) (Sec.
4.5). We summarise our ﬁndings in Section 5.

2. Experimental set-up

The experimental set-up is described in [12], nevertheless
we give a short summary. We use a detector (Fig. 1) with a
triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [13] stack with standard
10 × 10 cm2 foils. The transfer gaps 1 and 2, and the induction
gap have a width of 2 mm. Above the GEM stack a wire-grid
(wire spacing/diameter: 2 mm/100 µm) is mounted at a distance
of dDrift = 21.35 ± 0.12 mm. The grid is followed at a distance
dT3 = 6.4 ± 0.2 mm by a mesh serving as drift cathode. This

in the drift gap and in the transfer gap 3, a signal is induced
on the grid. The time at which the ions cross the grid (tGrid) is
extracted from this signal (Sec. 3.1). We use the time diﬀerence
tDrift = tGrid − tGEM and the known length of the drift gap to
calculate the ions velocity vDrift = dDrift
. Then the ion mobility
tDrift
is calculated from this velocity and the voltage diﬀerence across

Because the signals are aﬀected by a regular noise in the form
of oscillations in the frequency range between about 40 kHz to
about 200 kHz (e.g. Fig. 2a), an average of 2000 subsequent
signals is used for the data analysis. The average signal is trans-
formed, through fast Fourier transform, into the frequency do-
main, where frequencies above fCut = 10 kHz are cut out and
then the signals are transformed back. Figure 2 illustrates the
diﬀerence between an individual signal (Fig. 2a), the average
over 2000 signals (Fig. 2b) and the corresponding signals after
the frequency cut has been applied.

3.1. Measurement of the ion arrival at the grid

At the time the ions pass through the grid, the polarity of the
induced signal changes [20]. In the two plots in Figure 2 this
is visible in the Grid signal.1 The Diﬀerentiated grid signal in
Figure 2b has distinct peaks, which allow to identify the inﬂec-
tion points. The last inﬂection point corresponds to the time
when ions cross the wire-grid, i.e. tGrid, if the electric ﬁelds in
the drift gap and transfer gap 3 are the same. Simulations ex-
plained below show the robustness of this method.

A conﬁguration with a wire-grid and an homogeneous elec-
tric ﬁeld EDrift (ET3, respectively) in the drift gap (transfer gap
3, respectively) is used to generate signals with Garﬁeld [21] as
ions drift and cross the grid. An arbitrary ion mobility is intro-
duced into the simulations and 105 ions are initially distributed
such that they cover several wire pitches. In drift direction the
ion distribution has a Gaussian shape. The drifting ions’ sig-
nal on the wire-grid is shown in Figure 3 for ions drifting ﬁrst
through the drift gap and then through the transfer gap 3. When
the ions approach the grid the signal rises and it becomes more
negative after the ions crossed the grid. Eventually the signal is
zero, when the ions reach the cathode. Knowledge of EDrift, the
inserted ion mobility and the drift distance yields the expected
time of arrival at the grid, tExpected
. However, the signal shape
lacks a distinctive feature, which is suitable to measure the time
when ions pass through the grid.

Grid

Figure 3 shows as well the signals’ derivative. There is
an inﬂection point during the period when the signal becomes
more negative, which is visible as a peak. This inﬂection point
occurs at tExpected
, if ET3 = EDrift. Therefore the inﬂection point
in the ion signal on the wire-grid is suitable to determine tGrid,
if the electric ﬁeld on both sides of the grid is the same.

Grid

In order to test the reliability of this inﬂection point method
the simulations are tuned to reproduce the shape of measured
signals including the overlaying of a periodic noise (Fig. 4a).

region between grid and mesh (GEM1 top, respectively) is re-
ferred as transfer gap 3 (drift gap, respectively). A ﬁeld strip
mounted at the GEM-stack-side of the grid is used to improve
the ﬁeld homogeneity.

We use an open gas system employing Bronkhorst F-201CV
[14] mass ﬂow controllers which allow one to mix up to three
diﬀerent gases. The detector exhaust consist of several metres
of 4 mm pipe. The temperature is monitored by the lab’s air
conditioning system and the atmospheric pressure is recorded
by a transmitter of the CTE7000 series [15] located elsewhere.
Both values are used to correct the measured mobilities. A
DewMaster water sensor [16] is placed shortly after the detec-
tor in the gas exhaust line, to monitor the water content of the
counting gas. The sensor is a double-cooling stage chilled mir-
ror hygrometer with a precision of 1 ppm.

Each electrode is powered with an individual channel of ei-
ther a CAEN N471 [17] Power Supply (PS) or a CAEN N470
[18] PS, therefore, the voltage on each electrode can be tuned
individually.

Signals are decoupled from the High Voltage (HV) line to
the wire-grid using a CDec = 20 nF capacitor and afterwards
the signals are fed into an ORTEC 142IH [19] preampliﬁer. A
similar preampliﬁer is used to decouple and process the sig-
nals from the HV line supplying the GEM1 bottom electrode.
This preampliﬁer is suitable for millisecond rise time signals,
as conﬁrmed with a pulse generator.

3. Principle of measurement

Electrons from primary tracks in the drift gap drift to the
GEM stack. The ions from the gas ampliﬁcation produced in
GEM3 and GEM2 drift through the stack and induce a signal
on the GEM1 bottom electrode, as they leave the GEM stack
at a time tGEM. Afterwards the ions drift in a uniform electric
ﬁeld towards the wire-grid. Behind the grid a similar ﬁeld as in
the drift gap is set. Throughout the entire time of ions moving

include square, triangular, and asymmetric multiple-Gaussian
distributions. Figure 4b shows that the results for tExpected

do not depend on the initial ion distribution in the simulation as
long as the drift distance is measured from the centre of gravity
of the ion distribution to the grid.

3.2. Discrimination between ions with diﬀerent mobilities

Simulations similar to the ones presented in Figure 4 are
used to examine the case where several ion species with dif-
ferent mobilities drift. The induced signals on the wire grid is
simulated in a ﬁrst step for the respective single ion species. Af-
terwards, these signals are overlaid to yield one signal of several
ions with diﬀerent mobility. Proceeding in steps is necessary,
because Garﬁeld does not oﬀer the possibility to introduce more
than one ion mobility. If the arrival time of two ion species dif-
fers by more than ∆tGrid= 100 µs, distinct inﬂection points are
obtained for each species. Using Equation (1), ∆tGrid can be
translated to a relative diﬀerence between two mobilities, which
can be resolved by our method:

e.g. for dDrift = 21.53 mm, EDrift = 400 V cm−1, and K = 2

3.3. Ion signal at the GEM1 bottom electrode

In the simulations discussed in Section 3.1 the initial ion
distribution is an input to the calculations, so its centre of grav-
ity is known as is the start-time tGEM of the ion mobility mea-
surement. In the real set-up the ion distribution is a result of the

derivative. The vertical red line marks the time at which the ions are expected
to arrive at the grid (tExpected

).

The resulting waveforms are then fed in the data analysis chain
and the ratio of tExpected
to tGrid is determined. This is done for
diﬀerent mobilities, varying EDrift and ET3, and diﬀerent ini-
tial ion distributions. For each simulation several values of fCut
are used during the analysis. The range of electric ﬁelds in the
simulation is similar to the actual ﬁelds used during the mea-
surements. Furthermore, the pressure (temperature) in the sim-
ulation is set to atmospheric pressure (room temperature) and
varied in order to cover the gas conditions during our measure-
ments. The results in Figure 4b illustrates that the inﬂection
point of the grid signal is indeed a reliable measure to determine

gas ampliﬁcation in the GEM stack. The distribution is mea-
sured using the induced ion signal at the GEM1 bottom elec-
trode. Ions from the electron ampliﬁcation in GEM3 dominate
the signal at our high voltage settings, however, there is a small
contribution of ions originating at GEM2. These ions are spread
in space, hence tGEM should be deﬁned as the time when half of
the ions has crossed GEM1 and entered the drift gap.

These signals are averaged over 2000 or 3000 subsequent events
for each ﬁeld setting. The ions’ drift time is extracted as ex-
plained in Section 3.1 and 3.4 and the ion mobility K(EDrift)
(1)). We apply the commonly used den-
is calculated (Eq.
sity correction (e.g. [1, 8]) to the gas density at 273.15 K and
1013 mbar to calculate the reduced mobility K0 using TMeas and
PMeas during each measurement.2

3.4. Measurement of the ions entering the drift gap

The signal induced on the GEM1 bottom electrode rises as
the ions move towards it, and falls when the ions either cross
GEM1 or are collected by the electrode (Fig. 2). The maxi-
mum of this signal thus corresponds to the time when the ions
reach the level of GEM1 bottom. The voltage settings of the
GEM stack are tuned to reach a small width of the ion sig-

the GEM1 top electrode, hence an oﬀset due to the width of
the GEM foil (∼ 50 µm) is introduced using the peak in the
GEM1 bottom signal. The time it takes one ion to cross GEM1
can be estimated to be lower than 1 µs, using conservative val-
ues for the mobility and the electric ﬁeld inside the GEM hole
(K = 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, EGEM= 10 kV cm−1). On the other hand,
the ﬁeld leakage from the GEM1 holes into the drift volume
produces a small, local increase of the drift ﬁeld near the GEM.
We therefore ignore these two, competing eﬀects and chose the
start-time of the ions’ drift time measurement (tGEM) to be the
time of the highest amplitude in the GEM1 bottom signal.

The actual results are shown from Section 4.2 on. In the fol-
lowing we discuss shortly the uncertainties aﬀecting our mea-
surement.

4.1. Estimate of uncertainties in the experiment
4.1.1. Time measurements

The drift time of the ions (tDrift in Eq.

(1)) is calculated
from tGEM and tGrid. The start time, tGEM, is determined as the
time at which the peak in the signal from the GEM1 bottom
electrode reaches its most negative amplitude (cf. Sec. 3.4).
In Figure 2 tGEM is marked by the ﬁrst vertical line. A mini-
mum (maximum, respectively) of the oscillations peaking close
to (at, respectively) the actual minimum in the signal, will lead
to a shift of the measured tGEM. Therefore the uncertainty on
tGEM is half an oscillation period, i.e. δ(tGEM) = 20 µs.

The tGrid measurement is examined with the simulations dis-
cussed in Section 3.1. The removal of the oscillations on top of

4. Results

For a given gas mixture, the induced signals at the GEM1
bottom electrode and at the wire-grid are simultaneously recorded.

the actual signal introduces an uncertainty on tGrid. After ap-
plying the frequency cut, oscillations remain in the grid signal
and in turn in its derivative. The location of the maxima in the
derivative’s oscillations inﬂuences the found tGrid. We quanti-
ﬁed the uncertainty on the tGrid measurement due to this eﬀect
with simulations of the wire-grid signal (Sec. 3.1). Figure 4b
shows the ratio tGrid/tExpected
and the spread of this quantity oc-
curring when fCut is varied. Based on this test we conclude that
the relative error of our method to determine tGrid is not larger
than ±2 %. The error on tGrid is hence δ(tGrid) = 0.02 · tGrid.

4.1.2. Set-voltages

The uncertainty on each set voltage is δ(USet) = 2 V. There-
fore the full uncertainty on the voltage diﬀerence across the drift
gap is

δ(∆UDrift) =

δ(UGEM1 Top)2 + δ(UGrid)2 =

√

2 · 2 V .

(4)

This uncertainty is fully correlated among subsequent measure-
ments without changing the voltages in-between. However, the
mobility is always measured for diﬀerent EDrift and therefore
diﬀerent voltage settings.

4.1.3. Drift length

The error on the drift length δ(dDrift) is a systematic uncer-
tainty, which is fully correlated among all measurements with
the same dDrift. The measurement of the spacers used to deﬁne
the drift length yields an uncertainty of about 0.1 mm (Sec. 2).

4.1.4. Gas conditions

We assume conservative statistical errors of the pressure
and temperature of δ(PMeas) = 1 mbar and δ(TMeas) = 0.5 K,
respectively. The ﬂow stability of the employed mass ﬂow me-
ters is 0.1 %. Considering the highest and lowest ﬂow used dur-
ing all measurements, the largest uncertainty on a mixing ratio
is estimated to be lower than 1.7 %. E.g: The uncertainty of a
10 % component of a gas mixture is thus 0.17 %.

4.2. Mobility as function of EDrift

Figure 5 shows the inverse of the reduced mobility K0 as
a function of EDrift for diﬀerent Ar-CO2 and Ne-CO2 mixtures.
The drift ﬁeld (EDrift/N, respectively) ranges from 200 V cm−1
to 1100 V cm−1 (0.84 Td to 4.6 Td, respectively3) while the av-
erage gas pressure and temperature is 966 ± 9 mbar and 293.5 ±
1.5 K, respectively. For these values of EDrift, the (reduced) ion
mobility of each mixture is found to be constant, which is the

expected behaviour for low electric ﬁelds. (For high ﬁelds the
mobility changes with the electric ﬁeld with a K ∼ 1/
E de-
pendence [28].) An electric ﬁeld is considered as low, if the
energy, gained by an ion from the ﬁeld, is much smaller than
the thermal energy (cf. [1]) i.e. if

where the masses m1 and m2 have to be chosen according to
the masses of the ion and its collision partner and l is the mean
free path between collisions. The mass factor in Equation (5)
will be ≥ 2, considering the masses of the atoms and molecules
in the used gas mixtures. The inequality is thus not fulﬁlled
(l = 100 nm, E = 1000 V cm−1)4 at our gas conditions, however,
the energy gained from the ﬁeld is not much larger than kT . We
therefore measure K(EDrift) in a range where the transition from
K ∼ const to K ∼ 1/

4.3. Blanc’s law for Ar- and Ne-CO2

Since the measured mobilities do not depend on the drift
ﬁeld, a weighted mean of the measurements is calculated, weight-
ing each measurement with its uncertainty. The corresponding
error of the weighted mean is calculated and added in quadra-
ture with the systematic uncertainty on the drift length.

No indication for more than one drifting ion species is ob-
served in the data, which ﬁts the expectation that only one type
of (CO2 based cluster) ion drifts in the Ar-CO2 and the Ne-CO2
mixtures [25]. Hence Blanc’s law [27] can be applied in order
to extract the mobility of these ions in pure argon (respectively
neon) and pure carbon-dioxide. To this end a ﬁt of the type

respectively, while fCO2 is the CO2 fraction in the mixture. The
superscript on the K0s indicates the mobility of the drifting ion
in the particular gas or mixture. The extrapolated mobility at
100 % CO2, KCO2
, is compatible, within errors, for both argon
and neon mixtures (Table 1). This may indicate that in both
mixtures the same (cluster) ion species drifts. The results ob-
tained by the presented method are compatible with other mea-
surements [22, 23, 25, 26].

We compare our results in Table 1 to results of ion mo-
bility measurements for diﬀerent argon-, neon-, nitrogen-, and
carbon-dioxide-based (cluster) ions drifting in the respective
pure gases [8, 9, 10, 11]. Most of the mobilities included in
these reviews are obtained at diﬀerent E/N, TMeas or PMeas as
compared to the gas conditions present during this work. In [30]
a reduced mobility of 1.06 ± 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 is reported for a
not identiﬁed carbon-dioxide based cluster ion, possible con-
taining hydrogen, measured in CO2 (TMeas = 298 K, PMeas =

1016 mbar). This value is compatible with our KCO2
, gained
from the Ar-CO2 and Ne-CO2 measurements (Table 1). Thus
the comparison to the [30] data is a strong indication that the
drifting ion species in Ar-CO2 and Ne-CO2 is a CO2 based
cluster ion as is suggested for these gas mixtures [25]. A re-
duced mobility of ∼ 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CO+
2 CO2 drifting in
carbon dioxide is reported in [31, 11] (TMeas = 300 K, PMeas =
0.666 mbar). However, it has to be kept in mind that the ion
clustering processes can diﬀer for diﬀerent gas pressure and
temperature [30], which makes an extrapolation between mea-
surements at diﬀerent TMeas and PMeas not signiﬁcant.

4.4. N2 in Ne-CO2 mixtures

The addition of N2 to the Ne-CO2 (90-10) mixture is stud-
ied in order to determine K0 of the baseline gas mixture of the
upgraded ALICE TPC. Figure 7a shows several 1/KNe-CO2-N2
measurement series for Ne-CO2 (90-10) and diﬀerent amounts
of nitrogen.

For Figure 7b we average the 1/KNe-CO2-N2

for each Ne-
CO2-N2 mixture as done for the mixtures discussed in Section
4.3. Adding nitrogen to a Ne-CO2 (90-10) gas mixture reduces
the (reduced) ion mobility of the resulting mixture. The eﬀect
is however small, i.e. changing from 0 % nitrogen to 5 % nitro-
gen, results in a reduction of KMix

of about 3.3 %.

A ﬁt of Equation (6) to the data with either 1/KNe

0 or 1/KCO2
ﬁxed to the value in Table 1 yields the mobility of the drifting
ion species in Ne-CO2-N2 in 100 % nitrogen, KN2
= 1.8 ± 0.2

0 or KCO2
cm2 V−1 s−1. The other free parameter – either KNe
–
is about 8 % lower than the reduced mobility listed in Table 1.
This discrepancy together with the relatively high uncertainty
on KN2
could be an indication that the drifting ion species in
0
Ne-CO2-N2 diﬀers from the one in Ne-CO2. Nitrogen has a
higher ionisation energy than carbon-dioxide, water or oxygen

0

but a lower ionisation energy than neon [32]. The charge trans-
fer from Ne ions to CO2 molecules could perhaps be modiﬁed
by the presence of N2 molecules.

The reduced ion mobility of the baseline gas mixture for
the future ALICE TPC Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5) is 2.92 ± 0.04
cm2 V−1 s−1, measured at a water content of 130 ± 1 ppm.

4.5. Traces of H2O in Ne-CO2 (90-10) and Ar-CO2 (90-10)

In order to have similar gas conditions as are present in the
ALICE TPC most of our measurements are done with a water
content around 100 ppm. To study the eﬀect of traces of H2O on
the (reduced) ion mobility, the water content in Ar-CO2 (90-10)
(Ne-CO2 (90-10), respectively) has been increased from about
70 ppm to about 1000 ppm (respectively from ∼ 320 ppm to
∼ 2050 ppm) (Fig. 8). Water is introduced into the gas by in-
serting a given length of nylon tubing in the supply, since water
diﬀuses through nylon walls.

In Ar-CO2 (90-10) (Fig. 8a) no strong eﬀect of water ad-
mixtures is visible. The points in the ﬁgure are a compilation
of several measurements, partially with a large time between
subsequent measurements. In case of the Ne-CO2 (90-10) (Fig.
8b), all measurements are done directly after each other in order
to minimise other changes in the gas conditions. In this case,
a clear decrease of the reduced mobility with increasing water
content can be seen.

The weighted mean of each measurement series is again cal-
culated (Fig. 9). For the Ar-CO2 (90-10) mixture there is a de-
creasing trend for KMix
(H2O) as the water content is increased
from 72 ppm to about 700 ppm. In Ne-CO2 (90-10) an increase
of the water content in the mixture from 365 ppm to 900 ppm
leads to a clear reduction of the mobility by 5.8 %. A mea-
surement series with even higher water content (2200 ppm) has
been done, indicating that the decrease of mobility with increas-
ing water content is more prominent at lower water content.

tures, with respect to the ion velocity. Therefore the impact of
the H2O molecules is more drastic in the Ne-CO2 case. For
varying water content in a gas mixture there are no previous
systematic studies in the literature, we are aware of, in order to
compare to these measurements. They agree with the assump-
tion that water lowers the ion mobility, as suggested in [25]. In
the same paper the authors observe a ∼ 11 % lower mobility in
Ne-CO2 (90-10) while comparing measurements done at a wa-
ter content of less than 20 ppm to a measurement with another

8

detector using 100 ppm of water. In case the mobility change
as a function of H2O is this drastic at low water content, this
change could explain the diﬀerence between the Ne-CO2 re-
sults in [24, 25] and this work (Fig. 6b). However, comparing
between [23] and our results (Fig. 6a) shows that such an eﬀect
is not present in Ar-CO2 mixtures.

5. Summary

The drift time of ions through a drift gap was measured
using two simultaneous recorded signals. The start signal is
recorded on the electrode from which the ions initiate their
drift. In order to determine the time of arrival of the ions at
a wire-grid, deﬁning the end of the drift gap, a novel method
was developed. The induced signal over the full ion drift time
is recorded. The inﬂection point of this signal is found to corre-
spond to the ion’s arrival time at the grid. From the diﬀerence
of this two times the mobility is calculated. This has been done
for diﬀerent gas mixtures and for diﬀerent drift ﬁeld values in
each gas mixture. The eﬀect of water admixtures was examined
as well.

The measurements were done for drift ﬁelds ranging be-
tween 200 V cm−1 and 1100 V cm−1 at ambient conditions, with
a typical water content of about 100 ppm.

Ion mobilities are found to be constant in the explored range
of E/PMeas. From ﬁts of Blanc’s law to the Ar-CO2 data we
found the reduced mobility of the drifting (cluster) ion in pure
argon to be 1.94 ± 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 and in pure carbon-dioxide
to be 1.10 ± 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. For similar ﬁts to the Ne-CO2
data we found the reduced mobility of the drifting (cluster)
ion to be 4.06 ± 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 in pure Ne and 1.09 ± 0.01
cm2 V−1 s−1 in pure carbon-dioxide. The similarity of both mo-
bilities in CO2 suggest that the same ion drifts in the argon-
as well as the neon-based gas mixture. From a similar analy-
sis of nitrogen admixtures to Ne-CO2 (90-10) we found a value

pure nitrogen. It remains to show if the same ion species drifts
in Ne-CO2-N2 than in Ne-CO2. Admixtures of N2 reduced
the mobility as compared to pure Ne-CO2 (90-10) by ∼ 3.3 %
for an increase of the nitrogen content by 5 %. The reduced
mobility of the baseline gas mixture of the upgraded ALICE
time projection chamber, Ne-CO2-N2 (90-10-5) was found to
be 2.92 ± 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1. This value was measured with a
water content of 130 ppm ± 1 ppm in the gas mixture.

Furthermore the change of the ion mobility induced by the
water content in the gas was examined using Ar-CO2 (90-10)
and Ne-CO2 (90-10) mixtures.
In case of Ar-CO2 (90-10) a
slight decrease of the mobility was observed as the water con-
tent is increases from 72 ppm to 700 ppm. While increasing the
water content in the Ne-CO2 (90-10) mixture from 365 ppm to
900 ppm the (reduced) mobility decreased by 5.8 %. The eﬀect
seemed to level oﬀ for a further increase of the H2O content.
