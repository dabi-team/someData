Abstract

Challenging space missions include those at very low altitudes, where the atmo-
sphere is source of aerodynamic drag on the spacecraft. To extend the lifetime
of such missions, an eﬃcient propulsion system is required. One solution is
Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) that collects atmospheric
particles to be used as propellant for an electric thruster. The system would
minimize the requirement of limited propellant availability and can also be ap-
plied to any planetary body with atmosphere, enabling new missions at low
altitude ranges for longer times.
IRS is developing, within the H2020 DIS-
COVERER project, an intake and a thruster for an ABEP system. The article
describes the design and simulation of the intake, optimized to feed the radio
frequency (RF) Helicon-based plasma thruster developed at IRS. The article
deals in particular with the design of intakes based on diﬀuse and specular re-
ﬂecting materials, which are analysed by the PICLas DSMC-PIC tool. Orbital
altitudes h = 150 − 250 km and the respective species based on the NRLMSISE-
00 model (O, N2, O2, He, Ar, H, N) are investigated for several concepts based
on fully diﬀuse and specular scattering, including hybrid designs. The major
focus has been on the intake eﬃciency deﬁned as ηc = ˙Nout/ ˙Nin, with ˙Nin the

incoming particle ﬂux, and ˙Nout the one collected by the intake. Finally, two
concepts are selected and presented providing the best expected performance
for the operation with the selected thruster. The ﬁrst one is based on fully
diﬀuse accommodation yielding to ηc < 0.46 and the second one based un fully
specular accommodation yielding to ηc < 0.94. Finally, also the inﬂuence of
misalignment with the ﬂow is analysed, highlighting a strong dependence of ηc
in the diﬀuse-based intake while, for the specular-based intake, this is much
lower ﬁnally leading to a more resilient design while also relaxing requirements
of pointing accuracy for the spacecraft.

1. Introduction

1.1. ABEP Concept

An atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion system (ABEP), see Fig. 1, is
composed of two main components: the intake and the electric thruster. The
system is designed for satellites orbiting at very low altitude altitudes, for ex-
ample in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), deﬁned for altitudes h < 450 km [1].
The ABEP system collects the residual atmospheric particles encountered by
the satellite through the intake and uses them as propellant for the electric
thruster. The system is theoretically applicable to any planetary body with
an atmosphere, and can drastically reduce the on-board propellant storage re-
quirement while extending the mission’s lifetime [2]. Many ABEP concepts have
been investigated in the past based on radio frequency ion thrusters (RIT) [3–
5], ECR-based thruster [6–10], Hall-eﬀect thrusters (HET) [11–17], and plasma
thrusters [18]. The only laboratory tested ABEP systems to date are the ABIE,
composed of an annular intake and an ECR-based thruster into one device [6–9],
and the RAM-HET system, comprised of the intake and a HET assembled into
one device [13–17].

plasma thruster [19].

1.2. Intake Working Principle

The intake is the device of an ABEP system that collects and delivers the at-
mospheric particles to the electric thruster, the general design is shown in Fig. 2.
The intake must ensure eﬃcient collection of atmospheric particles and provide
the required density, pressure, and mass ﬂow for the thruster’s operation, while
minimizing the required frontal area.

Figure 2: Intake General Design including the Thruster’s Discharge Channel.

The number density is n and ˙N is the particle ﬂux. A key parameter to
evaluate the intake performance, is the collection eﬃciency ηc(h) deﬁned in
Eq. 1, where ˙Nout is the collected particle ﬂux and ˙Nin is the incoming one,
the subscript i refers to each diﬀerent particle species i = [1, Ns], where Ns is
the total number of species found in the inﬂow environment. As the VLEO
composition is highly variable, the task to eﬃciently collect each species in a
variable density range is challenging.

A further key parameter is the pressure at the intake chamber section pch,
which is an input for the thruster. By applying the ideal gas assumption pch
is derived as in Eq. 2, where nch and Tch are the particle number density and
temperature at the chamber section, and kb = 1.380 649 × 10−23 J/K is the
Boltzmann constant.

Finally, the output mass ﬂow to the thruster ˙mthr is obtained as in Eq. 3,

where mp is the particle mass.

Within this study, hexagonal and circular geometries, for the whole intake
but also for the ducts are investigated. To diﬀerentiate between them, the aspect
ratio (AR) is deﬁned in Eq. 4 and used, where S is the hexagonal duct short
diagonal, D = 2R is the circle diameter, and L the intake length.

1.3. Intake Literature Review

Over the last decades, several research groups have approached the intake
design for an ABEP system [20]. Most of those are based on diﬀuse scattering
materials, and implement a front section of small ducts to reduce the backﬂow,
acting as molecular trap, to achieve higher ηc < 0.5. The intake designed by
Nishiyama and JAXA [6–10], uses long ducts packed in a ring-shaped section
surrounding the SC body and ending on a conical reﬂector at the back, ηc < 0.46.
There they are ionized by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and accelerated
by grids to produce thrust. Busek Co. Inc. [11, 12] designed the MABHET
spacecraft for Mars orbit equipped with an ABEP system based on HET tech-
nology. It has a long and slender cylindrical intake in front of the SC with a
honeycomb duct section at the front to operate as a molecular trap delivering
ηc = 0.2 − 0.4. The intake designs developed at IRS [21–23] are based on a long
slender cylindrical intake with a honeycomb duct section in the front optimized
for both Earth and Mars atmosphere that can achieve ηc = 0.43. The Central
Aerohydrodynamic Institute TsAGI [24–30] developed a similar concept, but the
honeycomb is changed for a squared duct section delivering ηc = 0.33 − 0.34.
SITAEL and the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Aeronautics and
Aerospace [13–17, 31], reﬁned the intake design that started with the 2007 ESA
RAM-EP study [3]. The intake features several coaxial cylinders connected by
plates which form divisions of diﬀerent AR between each cylinder delivering
ηc = 0.28 − 0.32. This has been tested in combination with a modiﬁed HET

for ABEP operation and is the only ABEP system of intake and thruster in
one device that has been tested for continuos operation, to date, in the labora-
tory [13–17, 31]. The Lanzhou Institute of Space Technology and Physics [32],
designed an active intake with a two stage system, a passive multi-hole plate
followed by an active compression with a turbo pump system that can achieve
ηc = 0.42 − 0.58. Finally, the University of Colorado [33] investigated specu-
lar scattering and ﬁnally designed an intake using the optical proprieties of a
parabola leading to an estimated ηc > 0.9. A summary of these intake studies
and their main features and performances are shown in Tab. 1.

Finally, each intake design always needs to be tailored based on the thruster
applied and its requirements and also on the mission proﬁle: expected opera-
tional orbits (altitudes and inclinations) and duration (i.e. to account for solar
activity variation).

2. Gas-Surface Interactions (GSI)

Rareﬁed ﬂows are described by the gas-kinetic Boltzmann equation, which
is commonly solved numerically using the DSMC method [34]. Due to the few
collisions that occur in rareﬁed ﬂows, ﬂow parameters are typically strongly
dominated by wall interactions of the particles, in particular in VLEO [35].
Therefore, modelling the surface interactions of the particles as accurately as
possible plays an important role in this ﬂow regime and thus also in the design
of the intake [36, 37]. In general, particles can either be absorbed, scattered, or
undergo a chemical reaction at surfaces. Accurate modelling of these processes is
highly complex due to the lack of suﬃcient knowledge of surface properties, such
as ﬁnish, cleanliness, adsorbed gas layers, and especially when placed in VLEO
environment and the interactions that occur with diﬀerent gases, particularly
atomic oxygen (AO). Finally, due to the requirements for the intake design, the
Maxwell model is introduced.

2.1. Maxwell Model

Upon particle impact with a surface an exchange of momentum and energy
takes place, and the velocity of the incoming molecule is altered by the speciﬁc

5

local properties of the impacted surface. The Maxwell model is a simpliﬁed ap-
proach that uses two types of surface-particle interactions: specular and diﬀuse
reﬂection. The schematics are shown in Fig. 3 in which the velocity vector of the
particles v is represented by the black arrows with a thinner tip, ˆn and ˆt are the
normal and tangential unit vectors, and δi and δr the incident and re-emission
angles.

Figure 3: Mechanism of specular and diﬀuse re-emission [38]

In specular reﬂections, particles rebound when hitting the surface without
energy exchange, the angle of reﬂection equals the incident angle δr = δi, and
the tangential component of particle velocity vˆt = vt remains constant. Only
the normal velocity component vˆn = vn is aﬀected undergoing a complete inver-
sion vt → −v(cid:48)
t. In diﬀuse reﬂection, instead, the velocity of reﬂected molecules
v(cid:48) is independent of the incident one. Particles reach thermal equilibrium with
the surface and are reﬂected according to a Rayleigh distribution corresponding
to the wall temperature Twall. The Maxwell model deﬁnes the accommodation
coeﬃcient σB, to represent the fraction between diﬀuse and specular reﬂection,
and it is highly dependent on the surface material properties. The accom-
modation coeﬃcient can be implemented in both the momentum and energy
equations [39] and is deﬁned in Eq. 5, where the energy of the incident particle
is E, and E(cid:48) the energy of the reﬂected particle, while EW is the energy of the
particle which it would have at a full accommodation to Twall.

σB =

E − E(cid:48)
E − EW

(5)

For realistic free molecular ﬂows (FMF) and most surface materials, a full
accommodation σB = 1, corresponding to diﬀuse reﬂection, provides good sim-
ulation results on surface interactions
[34, Ch. 5, pp. 118]. Instead, specular
reﬂection is for σB = 0.

3. Atmospheric Model

Among the several atmospheric models available, the NRLMSISE-00 is used
as it accurately accounts for the lower thermosphere atmospheric conditions,
and has been previously used for work on ABEP systems [2, 40, 41]. In Fig. 4,
the averaged particle number densities and neutral temperature Tin are plotted

in VLEO for an equatorial orbit. The latitude is ﬁxed to 0° while longitudes
are averaged between 0 − 360° in 45° steps. The data is extracted from the
NASA Community Coordinated Modelling Center [42] for the 15/02/2020 at
00:00:00 corresponding to F 10.7 = 69.5, the solar radio ﬂux at a wavelength
of λ = 10.7 cm, and the geomagnetic index Ap = 4.1 . The date is selected as
it oﬀers the latest updated solar activity data for NASA Community Coordi-
nated Modeling Center at the beginning of the current research, corresponding
to low solar activity. However, once the mission lifetime and launch date are
set, the respective solar activity must be taken into account as can lead to large
variations in the atmospheric environment [2]. The selected altitudes range is
between h = 150 − 250 km. The lower limit is due to aerodynamic drag, that
starts increasing exponentially leading to very high power requirements [41]
and also heating of the SC [2]. The upper limit is set due to the limited propel-
lant collection, falling below thruster requirements by a typical sized SC, and
where conventional electric propulsion becomes competitive against an ABEP
system [3]. The dominant species in the selected altitude range are N2 and
atomic oxygen (AO).

4. The PICLas Numerical Tool

PICLas is a numerical tool for simulating non-equilibrium gas and plasma
ﬂows developed by the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) and the Institute of
Aerodynamics and Gasdynamics (IAG) at the University of Stuttgart [43]. The
code is a three-dimensional, parallelized simulation framework for the coupling
of, among others, DSMC and Particle-in-Cell [43, 44]. For the scope of this
project, the DSMC module with the Maxwell model for surface interactions
is used. Within the code, the proportion of diﬀuse and specular reﬂections is

regulated by the momentum accommodation coeﬃcient (MomentumACC). For
the case MomentumACC> RP ICLas a diﬀuse reﬂection is performed, otherwise
a specular one is performed during a GSI (RP ICLas: a given number within
RP ICLas = [0, 1)).

4.1. Simulation Settings

The simulation domain of the intake is discretized using unstructured hex-
ahedral cells. Due to the symmetry of the intake design, see Fig. 2, and for an
incoming ﬂow parallel to z, symmetry planes normal to x and y are used to
reduce the mesh size and therefore optimize the simulation eﬃciency. Addition-
ally, more optimized concepts are explored with two diﬀerent mesh setups and
simulation times to verify the results [45]. The ABEP VLEO altitude range of
h = 150 − 250 km corresponds to the orbital velocity vSC ∼ 7.8 km/s [2]. The
free stream conditions at VLEO are in the free molecular ﬂow regime [2, 23],
and the particle ﬂow can be treated as hyperthermal for the selected AR in
this study [23, 32]. This is valid at low temperatures when the random thermal
motion of the incoming particles is negligible compared to the SC velocity vSC.
Therefore, the incoming ﬂow is collimated entering the intake with a single free
stream bulk velocity vin(h) = vSC(h) at a speciﬁc incoming angle α. Assuming
a circular orbit, vSC(h) is calculated as in Eq. 6, where µE = 3.986 × 1015 km/s2
is the Earth’s gravitational parameter, and its average radius RE = 6371 km.

vSC(h) =

(cid:114) µE

RE + h

(6)

Finally, the temperature of the intake walls Twall is set to that of a SC in
LEO Twall = 300 K [2, 21].
Investigation based on variation of Twall in the
intake has been performed previously, but have shown no signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on intake performance [23]. The ﬂow parameters used as input in PICLas are
shown in Tab. 2, and are extracted from the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model
as speciﬁed in Sec. 3. Finally, all the species shown in Fig. 4, are accounted in
the simulations with their respective ni.

MomentumACC= 0.0. In the hybrid concepts, each surface boundary condition
(B.C.) is singularly deﬁned as either diﬀuse or specular. As a ﬁnal remark,
all the intakes are based on an Aout that is deﬁned by the selected reference
thruster [2].

5. Intake Based on Diﬀuse Reﬂecting Materials

The previous work performed at IRS on diﬀuse reﬂection-based intake de-
signs concluded that hexagonal geometries are the most adequate for the intake
front grid geometry due to the lower backﬂow transmission probabilities for sin-
gle and multiple ducts [23]. Such analysis included an analytical model, the
balance model (BM), based on transmission probabilities [21], and simulations
for optimal aspect ratios (AR) of the duct grid geometry, deﬁned as the ratio
between duct length and square root of its cross section. Finally, the results
have been veriﬁed via simulations performed with PICLas [21–23]. Based on
the previous work, diﬀerent diﬀuse reﬂection-based intake concepts are hereby
analysed by implementing hexagonal grid geometries for 3D investigation and
tailored, a given Aout, to the RF Helicon-based plasma thruster as reference [19].
Various grid AR are simulated based on diﬀuse reﬂecting properties to evaluate
the eﬀect on ηc. Finally, the hexagonal outer geometry is also implemented to
maximize the ﬁlling ratio (FR) of the duct structure as Ain = AIntakeF R, and to
facilitate ﬂow simulations. The baseline intake design used for the investigation
is shown within Fig. 5.

5.1. Design Improvement Settings and Procedure

The design improvement process is iterative. The starting case is set for
an altitude h = 150 km at an incoming angle α = 0°. Based on this diﬀerent
(intake) cases are designed, simulated, and evaluated for better understating
the scattering dynamics inside the hexagonal ducts in terms of ηc. The ﬁrst
iteration aﬀects the variation of overall intake size and chamber angles, with a
ﬁxed duct AR based on previous studies [21–23]. Then, the designs providing
ηc ≥ 0.3 are further adapted to the hexagonal outer shape.
In the second
iteration step, diﬀerent duct AR are simulated, while keeping chamber angle,
intake length, and intake diameter constant. Finally, the concepts with the
highest ηc are selected for further investigation and the respective collectible
˙mthr and pressure distribution of pch are taken into account.

5.2. Simulation Results

The three selected designs are named Diﬀuse-Nominal (D-N), Diﬀuse-Multiple
Duct AR (D-MDAR), and Diﬀuse-Maximum Filling Ratio (D-MFR). The re-
spective performance and settings are shown in Tab. 3. The D-N case is derived

directly from the enhanced funnel design (EFD) [21–23], adapted to an hexag-
onal shape, and hereby optimized for the RF Helicon-based plasma thruster.
This case is the baseline for all the upcoming concepts.

The D-MDAR design features multiple duct AR to increase the eﬀective
intake area Ain directly in front of the thruster’s discharge channel with larger
AR ducts, while smaller ducts are at the outer perimeter, as this region is
expected to have larger backﬂow. The schematics displaying the frontal view of
the D-MDAR is shown in Fig. 6.

The D-MFR case is designed to maximize Ain, while still taking advantage of
the backﬂow mitigation of the duct section. The number of ducts on the intake
is minimized and their AR equal, ﬁnally reducing the cross-sectional area of the
duct geometry while keeping the same wall thickness.

As listed in Tab. 3, the D-MDAR case provides the highest performance in
terms of both ˙mthr and ηc. Although, the D-MFR also provides ηc > 0.4 with
only half frontal area AIntake, this intake design provides a 10% lower ˙mthr when
compared with D-MDAR case. Diﬀerent incoming ﬂow angles α, see Fig. 7, are
simulated to assess D-MDAR performance variations at conditions in which the
SC may not be able to maintain ﬂow-oriented attitude, or due to the presence
of strong not-aligned atmospheric winds as seen by GOCE [46].

6. Intake Based on Specular Reﬂecting Materials

The intake designs based on specular reﬂecting materials, σB = 0, are aimed
to maximize ηc by taking advantage of specular scattering surfaces in combina-
tion with optical-based parabolic geometries. The focal point of the parabola is
designed to direct the incoming particles to the thruster’s discharge channel. A
general schematic of the concept is shown in Fig. 8.

Figure 8: Specular Intake Concept.

Furthermore, concepts with an additional stages are developed, named Spec-
ular Multiple-Stage intakes (S-MS), to combine diﬀerent area ratios to possibly
increase ˙mthr, see Fig. 9.

6.1. Design Improvement Settings and Procedure

The design improvement process is iterative. The base case is set for h =
150 km at an incoming angle α = 0°. Each case is tailored to the given Aout
of the reference thruster [19], and has diﬀerent geometric parameters which
aﬀect the focal point location of the parabola targeting the maximization of
ηc. Furthermore, the cases providing the highest ηc are the investigated aiming
to maximizing ˙mthr and pch. Concerning the S-MS intake concept, diﬀerent

geometrical stage combinations are simulated, based on the improved purely
specular designs, to maximize ˙mthr and pch while maintaining ηc > 0.3.

6.2. Simulation Results

The highest performance cases for the intake based on specular reﬂecting
materials are shown in Tab. 5. The naming of the cases refers to the focal
point position of the parabola in respect to the thruster discharge channel, the
schematics is shown in Fig. 10.

• S-FE: focus at the boundary between the intake and discharge channel;

• S-FT: focus located inside the discharge channel of the thruster;

• S-FI: focus within the intake itself.

Figure 10: Parabolic Intake Conﬁgurations (normalized units).

Finally, the S-FT-D case includes a frontal duct section to take advantage
of both the parabolic optical properties, and the low backﬂow transmission
probabilities of the ducts structure. The parabolic geometry is shared with the
S-FT case, but, due to the duct section, the Ain of the S-FT-D case is smaller.

Furthermore, the results for the highest performance cases of the S-MS con-
cept is shown in Tab. 6. The S-MS-F and S-MS-B cases are both applied to
the S-FT design described above. In the S-MS-F, AIntake ∼ Ain is increased
by adding a second stage at the front of the S-FT case parabola, while in the
S-MS-B case, the second stage is added at the back of the S-FT parabola.

The designs providing the highest ηc, the S-FT and the S-FT-D, are further
investigated to evaluate the performance sensitivity to ﬂow misalignment α.
Based on the results of the diﬀuse duct simulations, it is expected that the duct
geometry could prove useful on mitigating the eﬀects of α > 0°, as particles
could be captured by the duct geometry and redirected to the parabolic section.
The collection eﬃciency ηc and the output mass ﬂow ˙mthr at diﬀerent α are
shown in Fig. 11, where the S-FT case is examined in a closer manner between
10° > α > 15° to better understand the inﬂuence of α to the parabolic scattering
dynamics.

7. Hybrid Intake Based on Specular and Diﬀuse Reﬂecting Materials

The hybrid intake concepts are based on a multiple stage design and foresee a
(hybrid) combination of diﬀuse σB = 1 and specular σB = 0 reﬂecting materials.
The schematics showing the diﬀerent intake sections at which the B.C. are
applied is shown in Fig. 12.

Figure 12: Intake Boundary Condition Sections Scheme

7.1. Design Improvement Settings and Procedure

The hybrid intake concepts are based on the already improved designs pre-
sented in Sec. 5, and Sec. 6. Therefore, the design improvement process is
focused only on the overall intake performance eﬀect due to diﬀerent combina-
tions of GSI properties.

At ﬁrst, the geometry represented by the S-FT case is simulated with all of
its surfaces that can have both diﬀuse and specular scattering. This is achieved
by varying σB, therefore by changing the MomentumACC in the PICLas pa-
rameter ﬁle. Finally, it is assumed that for MomentumACC = 0.1 there is a
10% probability of diﬀuse reﬂection, thus, the surface is assumed to have 90%
specular surface properties.

7.2. Simulation Results

The results of the hybrid intake simulations are shown in Tab. 7. The
acronym SP indicates that the B.C. applied to the Intake or/and Chamber
section is simulated with specular scattering while DI indicates diﬀuse scatter-
ing. The HI case refers to the hexagonal intake with a duct structure similar
to the one in the baseline diﬀuse intake design of Fig. 5. The S-FT-D and S-FI
share the same geometric parameters of their pure specular versions, but each
B.C. is simulated according to Tab. 7.

Additionally, the S-FT case is simulated with diﬀerent level % of material
specular reﬂection over VLEO altitudes, the respective results for ηc are shown
in Fig. 13. Such simulation aims to resemble the eﬀect of diﬀerent GSI prop-
erties for the parabolic intake concept providing the highest ηc. In this set of
simulations, each intake section shares the same B.C. GSI property.

8. Discussion

This section discusses the results obtained for the diﬀerent design improve-

ments of specular, diﬀuse, and hybrid intake concepts.

8.1. Diﬀuse Intake Improvement

The diﬀuse intake improvement resulted in two designs to be the most eﬀec-
tive for propellant collection: the D-MDAR, and the D-MFR. Both provide the
highest ηc = 0.437 − 0.458 and ˙mthr = 0.0212 − 0.0240 mg/s, while the second
has a maximized F R therefore requiring less AIntake which might be positive
for reducing the SC frontal area, and therefore the drag. The addition of a
frontal section of small ducts enhances ηc by operating as molecular trap. The
sensitivity analysis on the ﬂow misalignment represented by the angle α shows
that a < 50% reduction of ηc is achieved for α = 10°, while this reduction is
below 20% for α < 5°.

8.2. Specular Intake Improvement

The specular intake improvement resulted in very eﬃcient designs, especially
the S-FT and the S-FT-D with a respective ηc = 0.943 and ηc = 0.887. Both
are based on parabolic shapes with their focus located inside the thruster’s
discharge channel. The S-FT-D includes a front section of hexagonal ducts to
reduce the backﬂow. In particular, the S-FT-D design resulted more sensitive
˙mthr and
to the misalignment with the ﬂow α which sees a steeper drop of

ηc, see Fig. 11. The S-MS designs provide high ˙mthr but lower ηc < 0.334
compared to the S-FT and S-FT-D designs. For comparison, the pch distribution
of the S-FT case and the S-FE are shown in Fig. 16 and in Fig. 17. The
diﬀerent pch distribution compared to diﬀuse-based intakes is due to the optical
properties on which the particle collection is based. The S-FT, see Fig. 16,
achieves pch ∼ 0.3 Pa, while the S-FE achieves a larger pressure pch > 1 Pa in
the central region while also resulting in a greater larger-pressure region, see
Fig. 17. However, it delivers lower ηc = 0.88. It is also observed that the S-FT
case provides an almost constant ηc until α ∼ 10°. For α > 10° the impact on
ηc becomes larger. In particular, by increasing α = 10 → 11° there is a further
decrease of ηc by ∼ 10%. Such reduction continues until α = 20° at which
ηc ∼ 0.13. A α > 15°, ηc < 0.6 and ˙mthr > 0.1 mg/s.

8.3. Hybrid Intake Improvement

The investigation on the combination of diﬀuse and specular reﬂecting ma-
terials on hybrid concepts diﬀered from the expected result.
It was initially
thought that by having a diﬀuse chamber section, the intake performance would
increase. However, lower ηc compared to their pure specular counterpart are
achieved. Furthermore, changing the percentage of diﬀuse versus specular scat-
tering on the S-FT case provided insightful results for the understanding of the
behaviour of the parabolic shape with diﬀerent material properties. The ηc is
maintained ηc > 0.6 for all cases with at least 70% specular reﬂection. Although
a speciﬁc relation of the σB parameter to the scattering dynamics cannot yet
be concluded, the results suggest an almost linear decrease of ηc as the material
becomes less specular and more diﬀuse, see Fig. 13. Such results are very valu-
able, as intake designs based on partial specular reﬂecting materials can provide
ηc > 0.6. Additionally, the results show how intake performance could change
due to possible material degradation over the mission lifetime, for example by
the action of AO in VLEO [2], and thus aﬀecting the ηc.

8.4. Diﬀuse Intake: Description, Performance, Render

In this section the ﬁnal diﬀuse intake is presented. Based on the analysis
of the intake concepts using diﬀuse scattering, the D-MDAR case is selected.
Compared to the other best candidate, the D-MFR, provides a more homoge-
nous pressure distribution, pch ∼ 0.27 Pa, in front of the thruster’s discharge
channel as shown in Fig. 14, while providing ηc > 0.4.

The intake has an hexagonal shape and it features a front section of hexag-

onal ducts with diﬀerent AR:

• Larger ducts in front of the thruster’s discharge channel ⇒ increase Ain;

• Narrower ducts in the outer intake region ⇒ reduce the backﬂow trans-

mission probability, molecular trap operation.

At the rear there is a conical section with a chamber angle of 45° terminating
on the thruster’s discharge channel diameter.

Although the expected ˙mthr is low compared to the currently applied ˙mthr to
the thruster’s laboratory model [47, 48], 1) the thruster has still a large margin
to be optimized in both size and operational conditions (therefore inﬂuencing
intake geometry as well), 2) the input density is based on low solar activity,
therefore for stronger solar activities, higher input density yields larger ˙mthr
with limited variations of ηc. The pressure distribution within the diﬀuse intake
is shown in Fig. 14.

Figure 14: Diﬀuse Intake Pressure Distribution, h = 150 km.

In Tab. 8, the respective intake performance in the selected VLEO altitude
range are presented, while in Fig. 15 the isometric render view of the diﬀuse
intake is shown.

8.5. Specular Intake: Description, Performance, Render

In this section the ﬁnal specular intake is presented. Based on the analy-
sis based on specular scattering, the S-FT case is selected: a parabolic scoop
with its focus inside the thruster discharge channel providing ηc = 0.94, and
˙mthr = 0.23 mg/s at h = 150 km. Diﬀerent simulation times, verifying runs,
solar activity maximum-minimum, bow shock analysis, and diﬀerent orbital al-
titudes that are not reported here for the sake of brevity all conﬁrmed the same
performance values. Such design outperforms the diﬀuse intake also in terms
of sensitivity to ﬂow misalignment leading to a limit of α = 15° resulting in
ηc < 0.6. The pressure achieved at the back of the intake is pch = 0.3 Pa.

Although it falls under the estimated value for the current laboratory model
thruster’s discharge channel operating pressure pch = 1 − 7 Pa [47, 48], it has
been experimentally shown that helicon plasma thrusters can operate as low as
pch = 0.266 Pa [49]. The specular intake render is shown in Fig. 18, while the
performances are shown in Tab. 9.

8.6. ABEP System Performance Estimation

To assess the ABEP system performance, a preliminary thrust vs drag anal-
ysis is hereby performed. The drag FD is calculated assuming the frontal area

of the intake (specular and diﬀuse ﬁnal designs) to be that of the spacecraft
Af = AIntake, a drag coeﬃcient CD = 2.2 is assumed [50]. The SC velocity cal-
culated as in Eq. 6, and the respective density from the NRLMSISE-00 model,
see Eq. 7.

The thrust FT is calculated as in Eq. 8.

FT = ˙mthrce

(7)

(8)

Where ce is the exhaust velocity that, by applying the condition of full drag
compensation FD/FT = 1, the required ce can be extracted. Finally, as ce is
linearly dependent with v(h)2, and v(h) changes only slightly in the considered
VLEO h range, ce = 9.1 − 9.2 km/s for the “Specular Intake”, and ce = 35.8 −
39.8 km/s for the “Diﬀuse Intake”. This highlights the greater eﬀectiveness
of the “Specular Intake” compared to the “Diﬀuse Intake”, for example by
maintaining the intake geometry but increasing Af such that Af > Ain, to stay
within the range achieved by the state-of-the-art conventional EP thrusters [51],
an Af = 0.1 m2 would require for the “Specular Intake” ce ∼ 48 km/s, while for
the “Diﬀuse Intake” ce ∼ 190 − 210 km/s, way higher than what available with
current EP technologies [51]. Finally, the “Diﬀuse Intake” does not necessarily
be discarded, as its performance can be still tuned for delivering higher ˙mthr,
and could beneﬁt greatly from more accurate studies in low-drag SC design, and
experimental results on the plasma thruster development. Moreover, it can be
combined with a specular-based design to realize a hybrid intake.

9. Conclusion

This article provides with the intake working principle for an ABEP system,
and describes the main equations to determine the main parameters of interest.
Furthermore, a brief literature review of the currently designed intakes for ABEP
systems, highlighting the respective performance is presented. GSI models are
introduced and their importance in the intake design highlighted, along with
the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model used to extrapolate VLEO conditions.
Finally the numerical tool PICLas is introduced and utilized to simulate the
designed intakes. Hereby, it can be concluded that, concerning the diﬀuse-
based intake design, ηc is generally improved by the addition of small ducts
of given length-to-radius ratios in the front of the intake, but their presence
decreases F R, therefore Ain, leading to lower ˙mthr, and pch, not to mention the
AIntake > Ain that leads to increased aerodynamic drag. Larger ducts in front
of the discharge channel can increase Ain without increasing AIntake. This, in
turn, also leads to higher ˙mthr, and consequently ηc, as the particles entering
the central region right in front of the discharge channel cross section, and that
are parallel to z, enter the discharge channel directly without impacting with
the chamber walls.
Indeed, by hypothetically removing the intake, therefore
having Ain = Aout, the eﬃciency could be maximized leading to ηc ∼ 1.

24

An increment of Ain can lead to higher ˙mthr and pch, however, a change
of Ain also modiﬁes Ain/Aout which, in turn, can decrease ηc. Moreover, an
increase of Aout generally leads to higher ˙mthr but, at the same time, lowers the
pressure pch. Finally it is shown how a large area of uniform pch can be built
in front of the thruster’s discharge channel.

Concerning the general behaviour of the specular-based intake designs anal-
ysed here, ηc is generally improved by shifting the position of the parabola focus
to inside the thruster discharge channel. This also directly increases ˙mthr as
most of the particles will be focused to that point, rather than to a point that
is placed at the edge or before the edge of the thruster’s discharge channel. The
maximum pressure pch is generally concentrated in the area around the focus
point for the same reasons above, if a higher pressure before the thruster’s dis-
charge channel is desired, then the focus shall be moved earlier, at the edge of
it. Compared to the diﬀuse case, the F R is higher due to the absence of the
small ducts in the front, leading to larger Ain/AIntake and, therefore,

˙mthr.

The investigation of diﬀerent intake geometries, based on diﬀuse and specular
GSI, lead to two optimal intake designs for an ABEP system implementing the
RF Helicon-based plasma thruster, one based on fully diﬀuse, and the other on
fully specular reﬂections. The “Specular Intake” oﬀers the best performance
in terms of ηc with a ﬁnal ηc = 0.94 and a resulting ˙mthr ∼ 0.23 mg/s at
h = 150 km for low solar activity, while requiring ce < 9.2 km/s at VLEO
altitudes for full drag compensation. Therefore, it provides a certain margin for
compensating drag of Af < 0.1 m2 while maintaining ce < 50 km/s. Such design
is also robust to misalignments with the ﬂow compared to the diﬀuse intake.
The performance drops at ηc < 0.6 for α = 15°, therefore small α variations can
be tolerated during the mission, relaxing the requirement of the attitude control
and determination system (ACDS). The “Diﬀuse Intake”, instead, provides ηc =
0.458 for AIntake = 0.004 m2 and F R = 52%. Such design is highly sensitive to
the misalignment with the ﬂow, highlighting a −17% drop in ηc for α = 5°. This
results in a stronger requirement for the ACDS to maintain ABEP performance
over the orbit. Moreover, hybrid intake taking advantage of both specular, and
diﬀuse scattering properties are brieﬂy investigated. Furthermore, ηc cannot be
the only parameter used to compare two intakes that are based on diﬀerent GSI
properties, as design changes also inﬂuences areas and pressures, therefore, the
large ηc of the “Specular Intake” certainly is advantageous but it always depends
on is the thruster requirement, therefore making the “Diﬀuse Intake” also a
good solution for a given thruster. The use of the “Specular Intake”, moreover,
directly drives the particles inside the discharge channel of the thruster, instead
of building a slightly lower pressure compared and drive them due to diﬀusion
based on the “Diﬀuse Intake”. Which one is best, ﬁnally depends on the thruster
that is applied and its respective requirements.

Finally, in an ABEP-based missions, both the ACDS and ABEP systems
must be designed to cope with such deviation. Moreover, the ABEP must
be able to operate in a wide regime of density and composition as the residual
atmosphere is not an uniform environment, as it depends not only on the altitude
h, but also on the time, illumination, location, and solar activity.

Further investigations are required for the CD and SC aerodynamic design,
as well for AO resistant and drag-reducing materials [52, 53] to improve the mod-
elling. Currently, a set of sub-scale prototypes are prepared for being tested in
relevant VLEO AO ﬂow conditions within the H2020 DISCOVERER project.
The Rareﬁed Orbital Aerodynamics Research facility (ROAR) at The University
of Manchester [54] will be used to experimentally validate such designs under AO
ﬂows at VLEO conditions, as well as the future incoming results on aerodynamic
SC control from the Satellite for Orbital Aerodynamics Research (SOAR) [55].
Furthermore, the application of real material GSI properties to the simulations
has to be applied for later being further iterated with the intake testing. This
will serve to validate the models against experiments before building a ﬂight
version prototype. Moreover, the intake design work has to be strongly linked
(and iterated along) with the thruster design work, to ensure their operation in
a common range of pressures, mass ﬂows, and eﬃciencies. Finally, an ABEP
system has great potentials on Earth observation and telecommunications in
VLEO over LEO [56], and a near future ABEP technological demonstration
mission is needed. A GOCE-like mission [57] could serve to experimentally val-
idate the ABEP system. Novel mission types can arise as future exploration
missions:
long term high resolution data from Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld can be
acquired with higher accuracy, as well as continuous measurements of the at-
mosphere and higher resolution imaging. A small platform equipped with both
conventional and ABEP, would serve as technological demonstration. Further-
more, fully-ABEP-based SC can be applied also for exploration of celestials
bodies other than Earth, such as Venus and Mars, and even further for the
application to the gas giants and their moons.
