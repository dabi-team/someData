ABSTRACT
High-resolution observations of dynamic phenomena give insight into properties and
processes that govern the low solar atmosphere. We present the analysis of jet-like
phenomena emanating from a penumbral foot-point in active region (AR) 12192 using
imaging and spectral observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory. These jets are associated with line-of-sight (LoS) Doppler speeds of ± 10-
22 km s−1 and bright fronts which seem to move across the Plane-of-Sky (PoS) at speeds
of 23-130 km s−1. Such speeds are considerably higher than the expected sound speed
in the chromosphere. The jets have signatures which are visible both in the cool and hot
channels of IRIS and AIA. Each jet lasts on average 15 minutes and occur 5-7 times over
a period of 2 hours. Possible mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are suggested,
the most likely of which involve p-mode or Alfv´en wave shock trains impinging on the
transition region (TR) and corona as a result of steepening photospheric wavefronts or
gravity waves.

1. INTRODUCTION

The chromosphere is host to a menagerie of dynamic phenomena, including (but not limited to)
spicules, jets, shocks and magneto-acoustic waves. These phenomena are interesting as their forma-
tion within this physically complicated region, as well as their interaction with other atmospheric
layers, particularly the transition region and corona, are not well understood.
Fan-shaped jets, “Peacock” Jets (Robustini et al. 2016) or “light walls” (Yang et al. 2015) are an ex-

ample of rarely observed chromospheric phenomenon. These jets are typically observed over sunspot
light-bridges (Asai et al. 2001) with a mean lifetime of 10 minutes and some intimation in transition
region and coronal temperature observations. First observed and analysed by Roy (1973a), fan-
shaped jets can extend to 7-50 Mm with driving velocities up to 175 km s−1; an order of magnitude
greater than the typical ∼8 km s−1 chromospheric sound speed (Anderson & Athay 1989). Their
multi-thermal nature is clear, as signatures of these jets have been observed in both IRIS FUV and
AIA EUV channels (Hou et al. 2016a).
Magnetic reconnection is commonly attributed as the fan-shaped jets’ driver, typically as a prod-
uct of the submergence of magnetic ﬁelds via convection (Lagg et al. 2014) or rapid perpendicular
changes between light and dark penumbral ﬁelds (Jiang et al. 2011). This seems an appropriate en-

ergy release mechanism for emergence speeds in excess of 100 km s−1 (Louis et al. 2014). Conversely,
it has been suggested that type-i spicules driven by magneto-acoustic p-mode shocks can manifest
as jets (Hansteen et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2017). These spicules typically display upward speeds of
20-25 km s−1 (Sterling & Hollweg 1988), which are of comparable magnitude to velocity ranges of
jets observed in Ca ii H lines (Shibata et al. 2007). Tian et al. (2018) have observed two distinct
types of surges above a sunspot light bridge which they determine to be: type-i spicules, which are

4

short-lived (approx. 500 s), and; type-ii spicules, which are impulsive (initial speeds of 50-400 km
s−1). These phenomena have been shown to reach heights of nearly 10 Mm (Beckers 1972). Zhang
et al. (2017) suggests that these type-i spicule observations are the result of p-modes or slow-mode
magneto-acoustic waves propagating towards the chromosphere from below. Considering these jet’s
proximity to the active region’s sunspot, p-modes could be related to the driving mechanism of run-
ning penumbral waves and/or umbral oscillatory events (Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2003), which
have been observed to exhibit recurrent behaviour on time scales of 3-5 minutes (Priya et al. 2017).
For example, penumbral waves are produced by photospheric magneto-acoustic activity steepening
into shocks at the chromosphere (Felipe et al. 2010) and are primarily observed in Ca ii line cores
with three-minute periodicities (Havnes 1970; Felipe, T. & Esteban Pozuelo, S. 2019).
Hollweg (1982b) proposed that spicules or spicule-like structures can be generated by a train of re-
bound shock fronts repeatedly impacting the transition region from below. These shock trains are a
nonlinear development of oscillations of the solar atmosphere at its natural frequency, whereby the
initial impulse takes place at the photosphere (Rae & Roberts 1982). Plasma falls due to gravity
after having been displaced upward by an initial Alfv´en wavefront. The falling material compresses
the atmospheric material below it. This compressed material then rebounds; a process which repeats
several times, giving rise to the oscillating wake (Stein & Schwartz 1972). These repeating wavefronts
steepen into a shock train that is channelled along magnetic ﬁeld lines. Hollweg et al. (1982a) elab-
orated on Hollweg (1982b)’s proposition, suggesting that the shock train’s repeated impingement
results in an approximately constant upward velocity of the transition region and the heating of
chromopsheric material. Appreciable transition region and chromospheric motions still occur due to
acoustic-gravity waves (driven by Alfv´en waves) even when considering radiative losses (Mariska &
Hollweg 1985).
In section 2, we describe the observational data from AIA and IRIS of recurrent fan-shaped jet phe-
nomena at a sunspot’s edge. In section 3, we outline our data analysis methods and the subsequent
results. We discuss these results in section 4, and suggest plausible mechanisms to describe the jets’
dynamics.

2. OBSERVATIONS

We analyse two data sets from AIA (Lemen et al. 2012) and IRIS (De Pontieu et al. 2014) centred
on active region 12192. They took place on 25th October 2014 at 14:58:28 UT (data set A) and at
21:00:00 UT (data set B). At that time, the active region is located at the South-West corner of the
solar disk (approximately at X = 400(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = −315(cid:48)(cid:48)). Data set B includes spectroscopic data from
IRIS. We have analysed the C ii and Si iv lines in detail. Figure 1 shows this active region as a large
sunspot complex observed by the Heliosismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012), AIA
and IRIS, where the AIA and IRIS images are taken from data set B.

The IRIS slit-jaw image data from set A are a large sit-and-stare observation of a ﬂare within
the active region, with a 9.4 s temporal cadence, a 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48)pixel−1 spatial resolution and a 121(cid:48)(cid:48)×128(cid:48)(cid:48)
ﬁeld of view. The data consist of two data cubes in the 1330 ˚A and 2796 ˚A channels centred on
∼ X = 355(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = −303(cid:48)(cid:48).
The IRIS slit-jaw image data from set B are a large, dense raster of the active region’s sunspot,
with a temporal cadence of 66 s, a spatial resolution of 0.17(cid:48)(cid:48)pixel−1 and a 309(cid:48)(cid:48)×181(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld of view.
The data consist of three data cubes in the 1330 ˚A, 1400 ˚A, and 2796 ˚A channels centred on

∼ X = 400(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = −315(cid:48)(cid:48).
The IRIS spectroscopic data have a temporal cadence of 6.5 s, a spectral binning of 0.1 ˚A, a spatial
resolution of 0.17(cid:48)(cid:48) and a 120(cid:48)(cid:48)×119(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld of view (centred on X = 400(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = −315(cid:48)(cid:48)).
The IRIS data sets were processed using standard procedures to account for the eﬀects of thermal
drift, solar rotation and orbital velocity, saturation due to cosmics, and for radiometric calibration.
The AIA data from set A have a 12 s temporal cadence and a 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48)pixel−1 spatial resolution. The
region of interest covers a 269(cid:48)(cid:48)×269(cid:48)(cid:48) area. The AIA data consists of three data cubes in the 304 ˚A,
171 ˚A and 211 ˚A channels, each of which are centred at ∼ X = 394(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = −322(cid:48)(cid:48).
The region of interest is shown in ﬁgure 2 which consists of a sunspot with a nearby pore separated
by a bright foot-point. Figure 3 shows the IRIS slit-jaw images of the region according to the green
box from ﬁgure 2. The fronts emerge from this bright foot-point and protrude across the pore. These
fronts are clearly visible emanating from the foot-point, as can be seen in ﬁgure 4. Throughout the
time series, numerous fronts can be seen emerging from the foot-point before falling back to the
source.

3. ANALYSIS METHODS AND RESULTS

3.1. Spectroscopic Data

The IRIS data from set A were a sit-and-stare observation where the spectroscopic slit did not scan
over the jets - the position of the slit can be seen in ﬁgure 3. It was therefore necessary to turn to
set B’s raster IRIS data for spectroscopic analysis. This spectroscopic set B data is used to construct
maps of the region of interest according to Doppler/line-of-sight velocities, intensities and FWHM
broadenings. These maps are constructed according to the slit position as it moved across the active
region during the raster in a similar way to Bamba et al. (2017). Figures 5-7 show velocity, FWHM
and intensity maps with progressively smaller ﬁelds of view. Figure 5 shows velocity maps of the
region according to the C ii 1334 line. These velocity maps demonstrate Doppler behaviour, whereby

red-shift occurs near the foot-point and blue-shift occurs near the top of the front protrusions. These
red- and blue-shifts are also clear in the C ii 1336 data (not shown) and less so in the Si iv 1394
(not shown) and Si iv 1403 (not shown) data. Insets 1 and 2 are chosen as areas for diagnostics due
to the presence of this Doppler blue-shifted area in the velocity maps of each spectroscopic ion, the
results of which may be seen in Table 1. These values are determined by the mean velocity values
within each inset region. The mean Doppler shift range of insets 1 and 2 are -0.9 to -13.2 km s−1
and -7.5 to -21.5 km s−1, respectively, whereby minus values represent blue-shift.
Bifrost simulations show that Doppler shifts of single-Gaussian ﬁts for C ii 1334 and C ii 1336 are
well correlated with the line-of-sight velocity at unity optical depth, with a Pearson Correlation of
0.88 and 0.83, respectively (Rathore & Carlsson 2015). Therefore these measured shifts provide
appropriate values for velocity measurements.
Figure 6 shows FWHM spectral broadening maps for C ii 1336 ˚A . Spectral broadening coincides
with the position of bright fronts. They are most prominent in C ii and less so in Si ii (not shown).
Patches of strong broadening activity overlap strong Doppler blue-shift at the insets. The mean
FWHM spectral broadening in C ii is 118 ˚A in inset 1 and 181 ˚A in inset 2. For Si iv we ﬁnd 244
˚A and 181 ˚A, respectively. Bifrost simulations suggest that FWHM broadenings of the C ii 1334
data are larger than those determined with a single Gaussian ﬁtting due to the ﬂattened top of the
C ii 1334 proﬁles, as opposed to broader double-peak proﬁles. Therefore, single-Gaussian ﬁts may be
used as an approximate, lower-limit diagnostic of FWHM broadenings for C ii 1334 (Rathore et al.
2015). It is unclear if the maps (as a stitched-together image of the region of interest) of FWHM
broadening follows a single front as it evolves or if FWHM broadening occurs across the entire path
as a jet emerges from its foot-point.
Intensity maps are also constructed, examples of which can be seen in Figure 7 for Si iv 1394. It is
clear that there are sharp intensity spikes within the bright front region, particularly within insets 1
and 2, coinciding with the Doppler blue-shifts from the velocity maps. Table 1 shows that intensity

values for insets 1 and 2 are lowest for Si iv 1403 (not shown). While these intensity data are not
analysed in this study, they may be exploited in a future study, providing minimum values of energy
output via radiative losses, for example.

The IRIS raster moves across the region, capturing spectroscopic slices of data at each moment. The
velocity, intensity and FWHM maps combine these into spatial images, but there is a time dependence
to the sequence. It seems likely that the regions of red-shift and blue-shift are momentary snapshots
in which at least one of the fronts are moving away from and towards the observer, respectively.
From the data set B slit-jaw images, the slit lies above (or nearly above) the bright foot-point and
the source of the fronts at 22:29, or 5800s from the beginning of the observation, and overtakes
the fronts at 22:35, or 6300s from the beginning of the observation. This separation of 7.7 minutes
between the moment of return and the moment of emergence lies within the range of durations of
the most prominent fronts from Figure 8.

3.2. Imaging Data
The jets can be clearly seen as brightenings in the 211, 304, 171, 1330 and 2796 ˚A data set A
images and videos, as well as the 1330, 1400 and 2796 ˚A data set B images and videos. Brightenings
are also apparent at the foot-point of the fronts, located at the edge of the sunspot penumbra. These
foot-point brightenings appear to be recurrent.
Figure 8 shows time-distance graphs constructed along the red dotted path drawn in ﬁgure 2 for
the 304, 211, 171 ˚A, 1330 and 2796 channels of data set A. The path is traced by using a handful
of initial points followed by spline interpolation to create a 100-point path. Values found for each
of these 100 points are determined using a local average of the surrounding pixels within a 2-pixel
radius. Figure 9 shows time-distance graphs constructed in a similar fashion to those of 8, but for
the 1330 and 2796 ˚A IRIS data of set B. Data set B took place 6 hours after set A and therefore
required a new time-distance path to be plotted. A similar path length was used but it was found
that set B’s jets were far shorter than those observed in set A. Therefore it was decided that the
distance axis for ﬁgure 9 should be reduced accordingly.

Active Region Jets

11

The jets are evident in data set A’s time-distance graphs and are somewhat visible in data set B’s
time-distance graphs. These jets appear as bright fronts which emerge from the foot-point with
some initial speed, reach a point of maximum protrusion and then return to the foot-point. The
absence of initial data of set B’s time-distance graphs is due the raster moving over the path; no
data are available along the path’s coordinates until the raster’s ﬁeld of view begins to pass over the
path. Additionally, in order to account for IRIS’s orbital velocity, Fourier Local Correlation Tracking
(FLCT; Fisher & Welsch 2008) methods were used to re-align each raster image. The nature of
the raster, in which it moves over the time-distance path, aﬀects the resolution of the time-distance
results. This is the reason for the ’blurry’ eﬀect in ﬁgure 9, rather than any resolution diﬀerences
between IRIS and AIA images.
Only the bright front leading the jet emits in particular wavelengths, while a dark wake trails behind,
seen as the dark area beneath the jet curves in data set A’s time-distance graphs. These dark wakes
appear to be as dark as - if not darker than - areas unrelated to the jets. Conversely, the area beneath
the jets appear bright in set B’s time-distance graphs. Numerous fronts are present in the graphs
with apparent durations of 500 − 1000s.
Figures 8 and 9 also include light curves for each of these channels according to the mean intensity
from a 2x2 pixel region around the foot-point corresponding to the ﬁrst point of the path (see ﬁgure
8). These light curves show recurrent foot-point brightenings that seem to consistently (but not
always) occur before the emergence of the rising bright fronts, but can also brighten in the absence
of a rising bright front and, in the latter case, seem somewhat unrelated.
The diagonal dotted lines are manual tracings of the fronts as they emerge, providing estimates of
their emergence speeds. The range of these diagonal lines for both the set A and set B time-distance
graphs are outlined in table 2. It appears that the fronts maintain this initial emergence speed for
some time before slowing down near the point of maximum protrusion. The fronts then collapse back
to their point of origin. The descending portion of the fronts appear to have a less severe gradient,
implying a slower return speed. This will be discussed shortly.

4. DISCUSSION

The results outlined in section 3, particularly the time-distance graphs, are similar to those of
Reid et al. (2018) and Robustini et al. (2016). The jets develop as bright fronts emanating from
a foot-point with temperature signatures ranging from 20000K to near 2MK. These fronts may be
interpreted as adiabatic plasma heating due to a density increase as the jet strikes upper layers of the
solar atmosphere. However, these bright fronts are also present during the jet fall phase. The fronts’
life-time and frequency are comparable with the jets reported by Reid et al. (2018). However, we ﬁnd
the fronts protruding a longer distance, i.e. 15-25 Mm compared with 8 Mm reported by Reid et al.
(2018). This could of course be due to projection eﬀects or a greater inclination with respect to the
photospheric normal of the magnetic ﬁeld lines along which the fronts move. The fronts’ evolution also
matches previous reports i.e. emerging with some initial speed, continuing with a similar speed until
reaching maximum protrusion before returning to, or near to, the foot-point. Dark wakes are also
evident in Reid et al. (2018), particularly in the 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A and faintly in the 335 ˚A channels.
These wakes appear darker than the background intensity in coronal bandpasses. These dark wakes
are likely cool chromospheric material which simply emit far less in these passbands in comparison to
the bright fronts, but may still be dense enough to obscure the line-of-sight. Anzer & Heinzel (2005)
suggest that these dark wakes are caused by an increased density of Hydrogen and singly-ionised

12

Helium which absorb hot emissions from behind the event along the line-of-sight. However, this
study also demonstrates 1330 ˚A and 2796 ˚A jet signatures, whereby the 2796 ˚A time-distance data
lacks these dark wakes. It could simply be the case that the wakes are an injection of chromospheric
material that only emit in the Mg ii line. Additionally, the lifetime range of the jets from ﬁgures 8 and
9 (500-1000 s) overlaps with that of type-i spicules, which occur on timescales of 180-600s (Suematsu
et al. 1982). Hansteen et al. (2006) and Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. (2017) have demonstrated, using
1-dimensional and 3-dimensional modelling, respectively, that the top of spicules follow parabolic
proﬁles in time, suggesting that type-i spicules typically display quasi-ballistic motion consisting
of upward motion followed by downward motion (Shibata & Suematsu 1982), which would seem to
coincide with the time-distance results. Set B’s jets are evidently shorter and emerge at slower speeds
than their set A counterparts. Finally, the jets’ parabolic trajectory appears asymmetric, whereby
their ascension gradient is greater than that of their decent.

4.1. Asymmetries & peculiarities

The gradient of the bright fronts’ ascension phase appear steeper than their initial gradient of
descent, e.g. at times 4500 s, 6300 s, and 8000 s in ﬁgure 8. This is evident from the white dotted
parabolic trajectory plots. These parabloae were constructed according to plotted points along the
jets’ ascension phase with the descending half of the parabola plotted symmetrically around the
vertex. If it the ascending wave were to reﬂect at the wave front then the gradient of the descent
would be more similar to that of the ascent. In which case, it is possible that the jets’ ascent is
wave-driven but that the wave pulse will have propagated further up into the atmosphere. This
would leave the descent to be a mixture of ballistics and the atmosphere’s dynamics, whereby the
atmosphere contracts to re-establish equilibrium.
A small decrease in gradient during ascension phases is also visible at the 4500s and 8000s arches.
While the time-distance graphs in this study represent plane-of-sky trajectories and velocities, it
is plausible these drops in speed during ascension are an indicator of ejected material decelerating
faster than solar gravitational deceleration alone, provided that the jets’ motion consists of more
than its line-of-sight component. Roy (1973b) suggests that a perturbation in the potential ﬁeld
induces a braking force, opposing the jets’ emergence, assuming a horizontal magnetic ﬁeld through
which the perturbation tries to move. However, it is perhaps more likely that the fronts undergo
a ﬁeld-aligned motion and that some bulging of structures may occur due to transverse pressure
imbalances. This could lead to magnetic pressure and tension forces suﬃcient to oppose the motion
of the jets (Kohutova & Verwichte 2017).
Additionally, jets appear brighter in 304, 211, 171 and 1330 during their ascension phase than their
descending phase. Yang et al. (2015) have also observed this phenomenon in light bridges above a
sunspot. Light wall oscillations do share similar characteristics to this study’s jets, such as their
duration and oscillation velocity - 3.9 minutes and 15.4 km s−1, respectively - which is of comparable
magnitude to the line-of-sight Doppler results from table 1. However, these light walls appears to
be distinct phenomena with maximum lengths of 3.6 Mm as well as Yang et al. (2015)’s IRIS data
suggesting that the top and bottom of the wall appear brighter than the body.

This study’s jets share several similarities with spicules, notwithstanding this study’s maximum
height results. In particular, their average duration of 5-15 minutes (Sterling & Hollweg 1988) and
the proposed rapid heating of type-ii spicules to transition region temperatures (De Pontieu et al.

Active Region Jets

13

2007b) plausibly correlate with this study’s time-distance results. Tian et al. (2018)’s results show
that their type-ii surges can occur in quick succession on timescales of a few minutes, as is the
case with the large jets in ﬁgure 8. They also found that the type-ii phenomena can remain absent
for several hours and that signiﬁcant foot-point brightenings accompany these high-reaching surges.
This may explain the discrepancy between the speed and length results from set A and set B’s time-
distance graphs; the maximum foot-point intensity during data set B for each channel is at least 1.7
times fainter than their data set A counterparts. Speciﬁcally, the maximum foot-point brightenings
of the set A 1330 ˚A and 2976 ˚A data are 2.54 and 1.73 times brighter (in DN) than their set B
counterparts, respectively. The jets for set B are also shorter in extent and have relatively shorter
duration than those of set A. Furthermore, the jets of set A show higher initial speeds than those of
set B. Determining estimates of the set B jets’ speeds is diﬃcult due to the spatio-temporal aspect
of the scan and the nature of the IRIS raster data; having to co-align these moving frames produces
blurry time-distance graphs which inhibit accurate gradient plotting. Magara (2010) suggests that
these type-ii spicules occur due to magnetic reconnection between a horizontal magnetic ﬂux tube
above the light bridge and the background penumbral ﬁeld. It seems possible that a similar mecha-
nism could occur between the magnetic ﬁeld lines of a sunspot’s umbra and its penumbra (as is the
case in this study’s observations). Additionally, this may also explain why the density of the area
beneath the set B’s time-distance arches appears bright compared to those of set A. This discrepancy
is most likely due to data set B predominantly exhibiting type-i spicule-like activity occurring more
frequently along the drawn path. Magnetic reconnection can also account for the multi-thermal
nature of this study’s jets: Vissers et al. (2015) suggest that photospheric gas is heated beneath the
chromospheric foot-point to momentarily reach temperatures and ionization stages associated with
the transition region and corona in a similar manner to Vissers et al. (2013)’s spectroscopic obser-
vations of Ellerman bombs. The Doppler shifts (-11 to -17 km s−1) are of a comparable magnitude
to those of type-i spicules. This is also of a comparable magnitude to the velocity values obtained
from data set B’s time-distance graphs (∼20-40 km s−1). As previously suggested, the line-of-sight
Doppler shifts may not represent real plasma ﬂows; Zaqarashvili & Erd´elyi (2009) observed Doppler
shifts in spicules and suggest that these shifts may correspond to the spicule axis moving transversely
due to wave propagation within the spicules, as opposed to the actual movement of matter along
the spicule axis. It is therefore possible that the Doppler shifts represent the amplitude of waves
travelling along and within the jet region. A more detailed analysis may help interpret these results.
As a ﬁnal note on this study’s peculiarities, section 2’s 2796 ˚A video reveals that the nearby umbra
demonstrates wave-like brightenings activity. These brightenings are typically accompanied by os-
cillations in the surrounding penumbra. These penumbral waves may be linked to the nature of the
jet phenomena and a similar methodology to that of Reid et al. (2018) may be used in a subsequent
study to determine if such a relationship is present.

4.2. Physical Mechanisms

Hollweg (1982b) demonstrated that shock trains can move the transition region upwards with
speeds of 16 km s−1, with speeds as large as 50 km s−1 at the top of spicules. The general tendency
for bulk ﬂow speed to increase with height may account for an increase in Doppler shifts with height
(Beckers 1972) which correlates with Hollweg (1982b)’s small or downward velocities near the bottom
of the spicule, presumably at the foot-point. This seems to match with the results of this study,

14

Humphries, Verwichte, Kuridz´e, Morgan

whereby blue-shifts of up to 18 km s−1 occur near the jets’ maximum height while red-shifts tend
to occur at the foot-point. Whether this study’s Doppler maps show the jets’ bulk ﬂow speed, the
amplitude of waves within the jets, or momentary snapshots (due to the nature of raster data) of
actual line-of-sight motion is currently unclear. Regardless, a proposed energy ﬂux of 104 – 105 ergs
cm−2 s−1 (Hollweg 1982b) is paramount if these jets interact with the corona in a similar fashion to
spicules. Additionally, if these shock front trains are considered to be bi-directional (Pasachoﬀ et al.
2009) then a smaller descension gradient (i.e. a slowed return to the foot-point) could be an indicator
of gas pressure or some constantly erupting driving force opposing a gravitationally-induced return
of material (Reid et al. 2018), which may explain the slowed descent speeds seen in ﬁgures 8 and 9.
Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate that both line broadening and intensity increases occur along the entire
region of jet activity, following the trajectory of the jets. De Pontieu et al. (2015) propose that
magneto-acoustic shocks travelling along the line-of-sight can result in non-thermal line broadening
and intensity increases of transition region material within regions in which magnetic ﬁelds are
parallel to the line-of-sight. Olluri et al. (2013) also concludes that at least some of the transition
region non-thermal line broadening in the presence of shocks with strong velocity gradients (as is the
case in data set A’s time-distance graphs in 8) are caused by slow-mode magneto-acoustic shocks.
Simulations by Kudoh & Shibata (1999) suggest that spicule formation (a manifestation of lifting
of the transition region), non-thermal broadening of emission lines and even coronal heating are a
consequence of Alfv´en waves (produced within the photosphere) propagating to the corona. This
interpretation may explain the presence of intensity and non-thermal broadening within this study’s
region of interest with little Doppler shift activity, whereby these Alfv´en waves eﬀectively churn the
plasma as they propagate but demonstrate little discernible line-of-sight plasma motion.
More recent work also demonstrates that these rebound shocks can be achieved with a single initial
pulse (Ku´zma et al. 2017; Murawski & Zaqarashvili 2010). Murawski & Zaqarashvili (2010) ﬁnd that
an initial, 30 km s−1 velocity-amplitude Alfv´en pulse – potentially generated due to solar convective
motion of magnetic ﬂux tubes (Roberts 1979) - leads to typical type-i spicule properties such as
velocities of 25 km s−1 and lengths of 7 Mm. Low-chromopsheric Alfv´en speed estimates assume
a density of 1015cm−3 and a 100G magnetic ﬁeld strength, yielding a value of 10 km s−1 (Shibata
1997). However, while the Alfv´en velocity requirement is rather high for low-chromospheric speeds,
umbral magnetic ﬁeld strength is at least one magnitude greater than Shibata (1997)’s assumption
(Norton et al. 2013).
These single-initial-driver models appear to reproduce similar phenomena to this study’s jets and are
thus worth consideration. However, models of a periodic initial driver have also re-created spicule
properties, such as the leakage and channelling of p-modes along magnetic ﬁeld lines (De Pontieu
et al. 2007a). A fall-oﬀ of the acoustic cut-oﬀ period due to a progressively reduced gravitational
inﬂuence allows p-modes to tunnel through lower layers and subsequent steepening into magneto-
acoustic shocks (De Pontieu et al. 2004). This results in an upward motion of chromospheric plasma
at ∼20 km s−1 (Pontieu et al. 2005). Yang et al. (2015) also use this interpretation as the mechanism
resulting in their light wall properties.
While these magneto-acoustic precursors seem auspicious insofar as they produce similar velocities to
this study’s line-of-sight velocities, Robustini et al. (2016) suggests that such a shock-driven initiator
is an unlikely mechanism for the plane-of-sky acceleration of these jets, particularly for speeds in
excess of 170 km s−1 during data set A. However, they may still indirectly result in suﬃcient jet

acceleration as shock waves are often related to quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection (Zhang et al.
2017; Hillier et al. 2016).

We have investigated recurrent fan-shaped jets protruding from a bright penumbral foot-point.
These jets occur near-simultaneously with brightenings within their foot-point. The jets appear as
bright fronts in AIA’s 304 ˚A, 211 ˚A and 171 ˚A channels as well as IRIS’s 1330 ˚A and 2796 ˚A
channels. A darkness is left in the wake of these brightenings in all channels bar 2796 ˚A, which is
most likely caused by optically thick or cool plasma along the line-of-sight. The maximum length of
these jets range from ∼12-26 Mm with initial plane-of-sky speeds of ∼23-130 km s−1. The line-of-
sight blue-shift velocities of the jet fronts range from ∼-1 to -20 km s−1. FWHM results suggest that
broadening occurs over the entire jet region, suggesting that the line-of-sight results may represent
the amplitude of waves travelling along the region as opposed to the actual movement of material.
These results are similar to previous reports of fan-shaped jets but also share similarities with spicule
phenomena. Several physical mechanisms are proposed as the initial driver of these phenomena.
These channel-speciﬁc dark wakes, falling bright fronts and interesting spectroscopic results warrant
further investigation into the multi-thermal nature of these jets. Spectral diagnostics of the jet
parameters, such as energy, electron density, and temperature using optically thick chromospheric
lines, will be considered as avenues for analysis for a subsequent paper.
