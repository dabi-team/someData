The study of pion production and the eﬀects of ﬁnal state interactions (FSI) are important for
data analysis in all neutrino experiments. For energies at which current neutrino experiments are
being operated, a signiﬁcant contribution to pion production is made by resonance production
process. After its production, if a pion is absorbed in the nuclear matter, the event may become
indistinguishable from quasi-elastic scattering process and acts as a background. The estimation of
this background is very essential for oscillation experiments and requires good theoretical models for
both pion production at primary vertex and after FSI. Due to FSI, the number of ﬁnal state pions
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the number produced at primary vertex. As the neutrino detectors
can observe only the ﬁnal state particles, the correct information about the particles produced
at the primary vertex is overshadowed by FSI. To overcome this diﬃculty, a good knowledge of
FSI is required which may be provided by theoretical models incorporated in Monte Carlo (MC)
neutrino event generators. They provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions for diﬀerent
experiments and serve as a bridge between theoretical models and experimental measurements. In
this work, we will present simulated events for two diﬀerent MC generators - GENIE and NuWro,
for pion production in νµCC interactions on 40Ar target in DUNE experimental set up. A brief
outline of theoretical models used by generators is presented. The results of pion production are
presented in the form of tables showing the occupancy of primary and ﬁnal state pion topologies
with 100% detector resolution and with kinetic energy detector threshold cuts. We observe
that NuWro (v-19.02.2) is more transparent (less responsive) to absorption and charge exchange
processes as compared to GENIE (v-3.00.06), pions are more likely to be absorbed than created
during their intranuclear transport and there is need to improve detector technology to improve
the detector threshold for better results.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Driven by new experiments and modern detector technology, neutrino physics is entering a precision era and this
requires an improved theoretical and phenomenological description of neutrino interactions. Neutrinos rarely interact
with matter and can travel long distances without any interactions. The neutrino properties are still not entirely
understood and this makes its research a challenge for both theoretical and experimental points of view. Electroweak
theory of Standard Model (SM) describes the neutrino interactions.
In its earlier formulation, SM assumed the
neutrino to be massless particle and and so the mass-mixing was not expected unlike quarks. The mass mixing would
also be possible in lepton sector if neutrino had mass and a neutrino produced in a speciﬁc ﬂavour could be later
seen as neutrino of another ﬂavour, the phenomenon called neutrino oscillations. No fundamental principle in physics
requires neutrino to be massless. The strength of mass mixing in leptonic sector is deﬁned by Pontecorvo-Maki-
Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix[1]. PMNS can be expressed by three mixing angles (θ12, θ23, θ13) and CP phase
factor (δcp). Apart from these mass mixing parameters, the probability for neutrino oscillation depends on actual
neutrino masses (or on the diﬀerence of their squares) i.e. ∆m2
21.

For current and future neutrino experiments, understanding of charged current (CC) neutrino-nucleus interactions
in few GeV energy region is very important. But the study of these interactions in this energy region is complicated
and requires many intermediate steps, such as understanding the neutrino-nucleus cross-sections, description of
nuclear models, modelling of hadronization and intranuclear hadron transport and nuclear eﬀects. For this we require
a canonical Monte Carlo generator which may take into consideration all these steps. There are a number of Monte
Carlo generators dedicated to the description of neutrino interactions like ANIS [2], GENIE [3], NuWro [4, 5], GiBUU
[6, 7], MARLEY [8], FLUKA [9], NEUT [10] and Nuance [11]. All these generators are based on similar assumptions.

The primary neutrino interactions and ﬁnal state interactions are considered separately in each generator.

In this work, GENIE and NuWro generators are taken into consideration for simulation work of pion production
in neutrino-nucleus interactions. Pions form an important background [12] in many oscillation experiments and are
also theoretically challenging due to processes they undergo in FSI [22]. For both GENIE and NuWro, DUNE ﬂux
has been used for interactions on 40Ar target. For each generator only the charged current (CC) interactions were
considered. The processes enabled were quasi-elastic (QE) scattering, resonance (RES) production, deep-inelastic
scattering (DIS), coherent (COH) pion production. The data generated was then analysed for various pion topologies
before and after ﬁnal state interactions (secondary interactions). It is crucial for the presently running experiments
like T2K [14] and NOvA [15] and the future long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiments like DUNE [16–18] and
Hyper-KamioKande [19] to clearly understand neutrino-nucleus interactions.

The DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) is a worldwide eﬀort to construct a long-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) USA. It has a Near Detector (ND) located
575 m from the neutrino source and 60 m underground [20] on the Fermilab site in Illinois and a Far Detector (FD)
located approximately 1.5 km underground at a distance of nearly 1300 km from Fermilab at Sanford Underground
Research facility (SURF) in South Dakota, USA. The primary scientiﬁc goals of this extremely advanced detector are
to carry out a comprehensive program of neutrino oscillation measurements using νµ and νµ beams from Fermilab
and constraining the CP violation phase in leptonic sector. As the distance between FD and ND is about 1300 km,
it will provide a baseline facility of length 1300 km to study matter eﬀect. Both ND and FD will use Ar target
material to observe the neutrino spectrum that will help to overcome various systematic uncertainties. ND will
observe unoscillated neutrino spectrum and FD will observe oscillated neutrino spectrum. ND and FD at DUNE will
have diﬀerent dimensions and technology. The DUNE Near Detector has three primary detector components and two
of those components have capability to move oﬀ the beam axis: 1) A 50 ton LArTPC (ND-LAr) constructed using
ArgonCube with pixellated read out 2) The ND-GAr detector (also sometimes called the multipurpose detector,
or MPD) that consists of high pressure gaseous argon TPC surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter (Ecal)
in a 0.5 T magnetic ﬁeld 3) An on-axis beam monitor called System for on-Axis Neutrino Detection (SAND) that
monitors the ﬂux of neutrinos. It consists of an inner tracker surrounded by an Ecal inside a large solenoidal magnet.
In current scenario, two options are being explored for the inner tracker, one based on a combination of plastic
scintillator cubes with TPCs and other based on straw-tubes.

The capacity of ND-LAr and ND-GAr to move to take data in positions oﬀ the beam axis is reﬀered to as
DUNE-PRISM (DUNE Precision Reaction Independent Spectrum Measurement). The DUNE FD consists of four
similar LArTPCs, each LArTPC will have ﬁducial mass of at least 40 kt. Each LArTPC detector will be installed
in a cryostat with internal dimensions 15.1 m (w) × 14 m (h) × 62 m (l) with a total LAr mass of about 17.5 kt.
Excellent tracking and calorimetry performance will be provided by LArTPC which makes it an ideal choice for the
DUNE-FD.

Accelerator generated beams are used in many long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments[21]. As these neutrino
beams are not mono energetic, reconstruction of neutrino energy is required and for that complete information of ﬁnal
state particles is necessary. The identiﬁcation of primary state particles in the presence of nuclear eﬀects is a diﬃcult
task since the particles produced in the primary neutrino-nucleus vertex and the particles captured by the detector
can be diﬀerent because of FSI. This means energy reconstruction of neutrinos from ﬁnal state particles needs careful
examination. Neutrino experiments use heavy nuclear targets for large event statistics (which reduces statistical
errors) but the use of heavy targets gives boost to nuclear eﬀects thereby shifting the attention to systematic errors.
The current knowledge of nuclear eﬀects is still insuﬃcient to have clear understanding of systematic errors[22]. It
must be emphasized that success of any neutrino experiment depends on successful understanding, quantifying and
reducing of systematic errors coming from modelling neutrino-nucleus interactions.

In our simulation, the DUNE neutrino ﬂux [23] in the energy range 0.125-19.875 GeV on 40Ar nuclei was used.
The neutrino ﬂux used in our simulation work is shown in Fig. 1. It covers the energy spectrum from about hundred
MeV to tens of GeV and peaks around 2.5 GeV. The Neutrino at Main Injector (NuMI) beamline facility at Fermilab
provides an intense, high purity, wide-band neutrino beam with an initial power of 1.2 MW (will be further upgraded
to 2.4 MW) for which 1.1×1021 protons are expected per year from the accelerator. The primary beam of protons
coming from the main injector accelerator in the energy range 60-120 GeV is made to smash on the graphite target
which results in the production of pions and kaons. These mesons will be further focussed toward a 200 m long
decay pipe with the help of magnetic horns where they will decay into neutrinos and leptons. The neutrino and
anti-neutrino beams can be separately ejected by changing the polarity of focussing magnets.

This paper is organised into following sections: Section-II contains description of pion production in neutrino-
nucleus interactions. In this section QE, RES, DIS and COH processes are discussed in detail. An outline of GENIE
and NuWro MC generators with various models used by them is given in Section-III. Results of simulation are given
in Section-IV followed by summary and conclusions in Section-V.

II. PION PRODUCTION IN NEUTRINO-NUCLEUS INTERACTIONS

The simplest description of neutrino-nucleus interactions is built upon two attributes: a characterization of neutrino-
nucleus scattering and a model for nucleons in the nucleus. The modelling of neutrino-nucleus interactions is complex
as it requires linking together many diﬀerent pieces of theory. We will focus on neutrino-nucleus interactions in the
nuclear environment. The description of hadronization process and ﬁnal state interaction models are often speciﬁc to
a particular generator.
In its simplest and most common approach (called impulse approximation approach), neutrino-nucleus scattering is
treated as the incoherent sum of scattering from free nucleons in the nucleus. But practically, nucleons in the nucleus
are not independent particles but bound states and more complex nuclear dynamics are involved in calculating the
cross-section. The total cross-section of neutrino-nucleus charged-current scattering has the form [24]:

νN = σQE
σtot

νN + σ1π

νN + σ2π

νN + ........ + σ1K

νN + ...... + σDIS
νN

(1)

Here ν represents neutrino, N is nucleon, σtot
σ1π
νN is cross section for single pion production and so on.

νN is sum total of all cross sections, σQE

νN is cross section for QE scattering,

Neutrinos interact weakly with matter by the exchange of W ± and Z 0 bosons. At low neutrino energies, QE
scattering process is favoured. With the increase in neutrino energy RES and then DIS processes become predominant
(Fig. 2). DUNE ﬂux peaks around 2.5 GeV and at this energy RES and DIS cross-sections have almost similar
magnitudes. This is a problem experimentally, as in a detector, RES events can have signatures indistinguishable to
DIS events. Thus, it is hard to measure each process separately.

In QE scattering target nucleon remains a single nucleon in the ﬁnal state and only changes its charge in CC weak
interactions. In this scattering no pions are produced directly, but can be produced through ﬁnal state interactions.
Inside the nuclear environment, hadrons can be scattered elastically or inelastically, can be absorbed or charged
exchanged and can even produce more pions. Thus, it is expected that a small number of events with no pions in
primary state may produce pions in the ﬁnal state. For νµ beam, the CC QE scattering reaction is written as:

νµ + n −→ µ− + p

(2)

Here νµ is muon neutrino, n is neutron, µ− is muon and p is proton.

FIG. 2: Neutrino-nucleus cross-sections on 40Ar target for QE, RES and DIS processes, measured using NuWro (left) and
GENIE (right) generators.

Fig. 3 (left) shows how pions are produced in QE scattering process and how a pion can be absorbed (right) inside
the nucleus [3] during its intranuclear transport. Although the dominant processes that produce pions directly are
DIS, RES and COH. These processes are shown in Fig. 4 [25].

FIG. 3: Pion production in QE scattering (left) and absorption in RES scattering (right) [3]

In RES scattering, pions are produced from resonances. In RES production process, a neutrino excites the target
nucleon to a resonance state. The produced resonance state quickly decays into a nucleon and a single pion state.
The dominant contribution from this process comes from ∆ (1232) resonance state, although production of higher
resonance states is also possible. The CC RES scattering processes are illustrated as under (for νµ beam):

FIG. 4: Pion production via various processes[25]

νµ + p −→ µ− + ∆++; ∆++ −→ p + π+

νµ + n −→ µ− + ∆+; ∆+ −→ n + π+

νµ + n −→ µ− + ∆+; ∆+ −→ p + π0

If a pion produced in a RES process gets absorbed in the nucleus then it becomes diﬃcult to identify whether this
process is a RES process. Thus the resulting event gives the impression of a diﬀerent process and is called a fake
event. In a particular interaction channel, pure events are those in which particles detected by the detector are the
same as were produced at the primary vertex.

In DIS, a high energy neutrino penetrates deep inside the nucleon and scatters oﬀ a quark in the nucleon via
exchange of W and Z bosons producing a lepton and a hadronic system in the ﬁnal state. For CC νµ interaction, the
process looks like:

νµ + N −→ µ− + nπ± + X

(6)

Where N is a nucleon (proton or neutron), n is a number and X is any set of ﬁnal nucleons.

Neutrinos can also interact with the whole nucleus coherently producing pions (coherent (COH) pion production).

For CC νµ interaction, the process can be written as:

νµ + A −→ µ− + A(cid:48) + m+

(7)

Where A is the nucleus in initial state, A(cid:48) is the nucleus in ﬁnal state and m+ = π+, k+, ρ+ .......

The common approach with Monte Carlo generators is to use the Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model [26] modiﬁed
by Bodek and Ritchi to describe the nuclear environment. In the model, fermi motion of individual nucleons is taken
into account but its implementation often diﬀers for diﬀerent neutrino generators. The importance of considering
Pauli blocking [27], impulse approximation [28] and use of spectral functions [29] is also taken into account for better
description. The description of hadronisation and the propagation of secondary particles to come out of the nucleus
is also necessary. The simulation must cover the description of both re-scattering and absorption eﬀects and for this
modelling of ﬁnal state interactions is required.

III. GENIE AND NUWRO MONTE CARLO GENERATORS

Neutrino event generators are the simulation tools which are used in the study of neutrino physics and these
generators can be optimized using experimental data gathered from some previous experiments. Generators work as
a bridge between experimental and theoretical frameworks. The two neutrino event generators used in this work are
GENIE (Generates Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments) and NuWro (developed by Wroclaw University). In
our simulation studies, we have used version 3.00.06 of GENIE and version 19.02.2 of NuWro which are the latest
stable releases. GENIE is a universal neutrino event generator, developed by international collaboration and written
in C++. It is a modern and most sophisticated platform for simulating neutrino events and is developed by taking
into consideration ongoing neutrino oscillation experiments. It simulates neutrino interactions for all neutrino ﬂavours
and all targets over energy range from few MeV to several hundred GeV. This generator has already been used by
experiments like MINOS [30], MINERvA[31], T2K[14] , MicroBooNE[32], NOvA[15] and AgroNEUT[33]. NuWro is
more theory oriented, developed by Wroclaw University and written in C++. It is simple but complete package for
generating neutrino-nucleus interactions. NuWro clearly speciﬁes incoming (in), primary state (out) and ﬁnal state
(post) particles of an interaction. In this generator simulation parameters can be ﬁxed in a plane text ﬁle (params.txt)
and it gives output in a root ﬁle. For scattering oﬀ free nucleon, NuWro can simulate events for neutrino energies
from threshold to TeV. In NuWro, a beam can be set manually or can be loaded from ROOT format ﬁle, there are
choices for description of target nucleus including Fermi gas and spectral functions, there are various parametrizations
of nuclear form factors and there is a detector geometry module. Many quantum eﬀects like formation zone and Pauli
blocking are included. This makes NuWro a good tool for the use in neutrino experiments. Recently it has been
successfully used by experiments like T2K and MINERvA.

A. GENIE

The physics models used in GENIE can be easily understood by classifying them into three categories: cross-section
models, hadronization models and nuclear physics models. For cross-sections, charged-current quasi-elastic scattering
is described using Llewellyn-Smith model [34] using latest BBBA07 form factors [35]. Rein-Sehgal model[36] has been
used for the production of baryon resonances. For DIS interactions, Bodek and Yang model [37], with modiﬁcation
at low Q2, is used. Rein-Sehgal model with an updated PCAC formula [38] is used for coherent pion production
interactions. The hadronization process employs default AGKY model [39]. It includes a phenomenological description
of low invariant mass region using Koba-Nielson-Olsen (KNO) scaling[40], while at higher masses it gradually switches
over to the PYTHIA/JETSET model, the transition being gradual and continuous. To take into consideration the
eﬀect of nuclear environment, implementation of Fermi Gas model with modiﬁcation by Bodek and Ritchie, is used to
include nucleon-nucleon correlations. The factors like Pauli blocking and diﬀerences between free nucleon and nuclear
structure functions is also taken into consideration. The INTRANUCLEAR/hA model is used to handle intranuclear
hadron transport.

B. NuWro

In NuWro, QE events are simulated using Llewellyn-Smith model with latest BBBA05 form factors [41].
In
RES, only ∆(1232) contribution is based on Rein-Sehgal model and for rest of resonances, Adler-Rarita-Schwinger
model[42] has been used. Rein-Sehgal model is used for simulating coherent pion production interactions. This
Rein-Sehgal model[43] is diﬀerent from that used in RES processes. The RES region is deﬁned by a cut on invariant
mass as W< 1.4 GeV. NuWro uses Quark-Parton model [44] to describe DIS events. The DIS contribution is turned
on when W>1.6 GeV. In the region 1.4 GeV<W<1.6 GeV, RES contribution is linearly turned oﬀ as the DIS

contribution is turned on. NuWro uses its own hadronization model together with Bodek-Yang model. The eﬀects of
nuclear environment are taken into consideration using Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model.

IV. RESULTS

For both GENIE and NuWro, we have generated 2 Million similar sets of events using DUNE ﬂux. The number
of pions produced in both primary and ﬁnal states were obtained on event by event basis for each generator. These
simulated results are presented in the form of tables which show topologies of pion produced in primary and ﬁnal states.
A primary state contains topology of that pions which are produced in the primary neutrino-nucleus interactions.
A ﬁnal state contains topology of that pions which are produced after any of the secondary interactions (like intra-
nuclear scattering or absorption) may have taken place. For fair comparison of generators, a description of models
used by the generators and physics choices has already been given.

From Table I (GENIE) and Table II (NuWro), it is clear that for two generators, in many cases, there are some
large diﬀerences in both primary and ﬁnal state topologies (i.e. the number of pions observed in primary and ﬁnal
states). The diﬀerences can also be observed from Fig. 5, wherein plots for number of pions observed on event by
event basis, in primary and ﬁnal states have been shown for each generator. In many cases, these diﬀerences are
above statistical ﬂuctuations. For example, number of π+ observed in the ﬁnal state corresponding to π0 in the
primary state is 13618 for GENIE while the corresponding number for NuWro is 7182, the diﬀerence is more than
47 %. The number of π0 observed in the ﬁnal state corresponding to π+ in the primary state is 78184 for GENIE
while the corresponding number is 28650 for NuWro, the diﬀerence is even larger. The number of π− observed in
the ﬁnal state corresponding to π− in the primary state is 1787 for GENIE while the corresponding number is 13807
for NuWro. These diﬀerences are attributed to the fact that DUNE ﬂux peaks around 2.5 GeV and in this energy
region QE, RES and DIS processes all contribute signiﬁcantly towards total cross-section. Although the models used
to describe these processes separately are often common to a generator, still there are many diﬀerences in the way in
which a particular generator takes into consideration the merging of the relative contributions in this energy region.
This eﬀect in combination with other input parameters can lead to observed diﬀerences from the same set of models.

Another observation from the two tables is that both the generators have larger number of zero pion (0π) topologies
in the ﬁnal states than in the primary states. This shows that pions are more likely to be absorbed than created
during their intranuclear transport. Generally, QE processes give rise to topologies with 0π in the primary and ﬁnal
states while RES and DIS processes are likely to result in events with pions in the primary and ﬁnal states. Also
both the generators have almost similar 0π topologies. The diﬀerences may arise due to the diﬀerence in the values
of form-factor parameters and nuclear models used in each generator.

Using Tables I and II, percentage of events without pion (0π), with exactly one pion (1π) and with more than one
pion (>1π) is shown in Table III. It is observed that single pion production (1π) is favoured in GENIE while multiple
pion production is more in case of NuWro.

Tables I and II contain important information about ﬁnal state interactions. To extract this information, we
have compiled a summary table (Table IV). The summary table shows directly the topology changing eﬀect due to
intranuclear hadron transport. In this table, we show for each generator, out of all events with a given primary state
topology, the fraction of those which have both the primary and ﬁnal state topologies. The ﬁrst two rows show the
transparency of the nucleus. These rows give us the percentage of events with a single pion in the primary state that
will still have the single pion in the ﬁnal state. We observe that it is more likely that the pion created in the primary
vertex will not re-interact. The next rows show the fraction of pions absorbed and the remaining three rows show

10

the eﬀect due to charge exchange. It is clear that current version of NuWro (v19.02.2) has high transparency than
current version of GENIE (v3.00.06). This may be due to response of a generator to absorption and charge exchange
processes (NuWro could have too little and GENIE could have too much). Taking into consideration the complex
nature of ﬁnal state interactions, one can say that the agreement is still good despite these diﬀerences. The analysed
MC generators give quite a similar results. As single pion events form the main background in neutrino oscillation
experiments, the analysis done may be quite useful.

CC1π+ to CCQE cross-section ratio can be calculated from the corresponding numbers in our simulation for both
the generators. Table V shows comparison of ratio for two generators. For primary hadronic sates, GENIE ratio
is higher than that of NuWro which shows that GENIE has higher cross-section for single π+ production. The
corresponding ratio for MiniBooNE data rescaled for isoscalar target and corrected for FSI’s is (1.318± 0.247) for
neutrino energy of (2.1 ± 0.3) GeV[45]. Also percentage change in ratio due to FSI is 56 for GENIE and 39 for
NuWro which indicates that GENIE shows more eﬀects of FSI on π+ than NuWro.

The analysis done and results shown up to now were with 100 percent detector resolution (no detector cuts
applied). We will now show the results with detector cuts on kinetic energy (KE) thresholds taken from DUNE
CDR [46–48]). The KE thresholds used in our analysis are summarized in Table VI. These thresholds are ap-
plied to the outgoing pions and only pions with KE above these thresholds will be identiﬁed in the ﬁnal state.
The results of simulation for diﬀerent topologies of pions observed in the primary state and ﬁnal states, with
KE detector threshold cuts, are shown in Tables VII and VIII. Again there are diﬀerences in both primary
and ﬁnal state topologies more or less similar to diﬀerences observed in Tables I and II. The diﬀerences can also
be observed from Fig. 6 where number of pions observed in primary and ﬁnal states are plotted on event by event basis.

TABLE VI: Detection thresholds for various ﬁnal state particles at DUNE

If a pion has KE below the detector threshold, the pion is not identiﬁed in the ﬁnal state. Thus, in a ﬁnal state
with single pion topology, if the KE of the pion is below the detector threshold, the pion will not be detected in the
ﬁnal state and the event becomes a fake event for 0π topology thereby increasing its number. This is clear from
Tables I, II, VII and VIII that both the generators have fairly larger number of events (entries) in ﬁnal state for
0π topology when KE threshold cuts have been applied than without such cuts. For GENIE, the total number of
0π events in the ﬁnal state without detector cuts (Table I) is 590212 and with detector cuts the number is 766776
(Table VII) while for NuWro the corresponding numbers are 577221 (Table II) and 746450 (Table VIII) respectively.
The change is about 23% in for both the generators. On the other hand, in an event with multiple pions in the ﬁnal
state, if one pion has KE below the detector threshold, that pion will not be identiﬁed and the topology of ﬁnal
state changes thereby increasing the number of events for the resulting topology state. Using Tables VII and VIII,
percentage of events in ﬁnal state without pion (0π), with exactly one pion (1π) and with more than one pion (>1π),
with detector cuts, is shown in Table IX. For comparison, the corresponding results without applying detector cuts
are also given in the same table (i.e. Table IX). Thus, it is clear that detector thresholds can give signiﬁcant changes
in pion topologies in the ﬁnal state and should be taken into account for correct analysis of pions produced at the
primary vertex.

The summary of results obtained from Tables VII and VIII is shown in Table X. It is clear from Tables IV and X
that applied threshold cuts have shown certain diﬀerences for all processes and appreciable diﬀerences for some of the
processes. In the process, π0 −→ π0, the percentage of event rate has been reduced from 55 (without detector cuts)
to 49.1 (with detector cuts) in GENIE and from 71.5 (with detector cuts) to 62.8 (without detector cuts) in NuWro.
Similar trend is followed in the process π+ −→ π+. Third and fourth rows show that percentage of pion absorbed is

detector threshold cuts. As is clear from Table X, the two generators are following similar trends for results with and
without detector threshold cuts. The results are also shown in Fig. 6 where plots for number of pions observed on
event by event basis in primary and ﬁnal states, with KE detector threshold cuts, have been shown for each genera-
tor. It is clear that single pion events which come from RES scattering are least eﬀected by KE detector threshold cuts.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present work, we report an extensive analysis of eﬀect of ﬁnal state interactions on pion production for
νµ-nucleus interactions on 40Ar target. The results are obtained for 100% detector resolution and then compared
with the results obtained after applying KE detector threshold cuts. The latest versions of GENIE and NuWro
generators were used as simulation tools. We have shown in Tables I and II that two generators, despite having
similar sets of models, can give some diﬀerences in results of pion production both in primary and ﬁnal states. This
may be due to diﬀerences in the implementation of models and other input parameters used in two generators.
Both the generators show almost similar eﬀects of ﬁnal state interactions on pions during their intranuclear transport
after being produced at primary vertex. This is clear from Table III. It is clear from Fig. 5 that ﬁnal state interactions
create a diﬀerence between pions observed in the detector (ﬁnal state pions) and pions produced at the primary
vertex (primary state pions).
Tables I and II also make it clear that both the generators have larger number of 0π topologies in the ﬁnal state than
initial state leading to the conclusion that pions are more likely to be absorbed than created during their intranuclear
transport.
We have also explained the topology changing eﬀect during intranuclear hadron transport, using summary table
(Table IV). The eﬀect is more for GENIE than NuWro which shows that current version of NuWro shows high
transparency than the current version of GENIE.
CC1π+ to CCQE cross-section ratio is calculated from the corresponding numbers in our simulation for both the
generators. Table V, shows that GENIE has a higher cross-section for single π+ production than NuWro at the
primary vertex. Also percentage change in ratio after FSI is higher for GENIE than NuWro. On the whole, taking
into consideration the complex nature of FSI, two generators are giving quite a similar results.
Finally, we applied KE threshold cuts on the outgoing particles which are to be detected by the detector. Signiﬁcant
diﬀerences are observed on the ﬁnal state particles with the application of detector threshold cuts. This can be seen
from Table X and Figs. 5 and 6. Thus detector threshold are to be taken into account to get correct information
about the particles produced in neutrino interactions and there is need to improve the detector technology to improve
the detector threshold for better results.

Our results indicate that for a neutrino oscillation experiment like DUNE, the best strategy should be to have
authentic accuracy of nuclear models used in neutrino event generators applied for simulation and for that a canonical
neutrino event generator is required. As it is critical to understand nuclear eﬀects, a clear understanding of hadronic
physics of neutrino-nucleus interactions is required. The detector thresholds are to be minimized by using advanced
detector technology.

In future, more neutrino event generators would be used to compare the results. Also 2p2h events (also called
meson exchange(MEC) events) which have signatures indistinguishable from QE events and act as background for
QE events, would be taken into consideration in our future simulation work.
