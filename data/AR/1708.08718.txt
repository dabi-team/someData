Abstract

To ﬁrst order, the Earth as well as other rocky planets in the Solar System and rocky exoplanets orbiting other stars,
are refractory pieces of the stellar nebula out of which they formed. To estimate the chemical composition of rocky
exoplanets based on their stellar hosts’ elemental abundances, we need a better understanding of the devolatilization
that produced the Earth. To quantify the chemical relationships between the Earth, the Sun and other bodies in the
Solar System, the elemental abundances of the bulk Earth are required. The key to comparing Earth’s composition with
those of other objects is to have a determination of the bulk composition with an appropriate estimate of uncertainties.
Here we present concordance estimates (with uncertainties) of the elemental abundances of the bulk Earth, which
can be used in such studies. First we compile, combine and renormalize a large set of heterogeneous literature
values of the primitive mantle (PM) and of the core. We then integrate standard radial density proﬁles of the Earth
and renormalize them to the current best estimate for the mass of the Earth. Using estimates of the uncertainties
in i) the density proﬁles, ii) the core-mantle boundary and iii) the inner core boundary, we employ standard error
propagation to obtain a core mass fraction of 32.5 ± 0.3 wt%. Our bulk Earth abundances are the weighted sum
of our concordance core abundances and concordance PM abundances. Unlike previous eﬀorts, the uncertainty on
the core mass fraction is propagated to the uncertainties on the bulk Earth elemental abundances. Our concordance
estimates for the abundances of Mg, Sn, Br, B, Cd and Be are signiﬁcantly lower than previous estimates of the bulk
Earth. Our concordance estimates for the abundances of Na, K, Cl, Zn, Sr, F, Ga, Rb, Nb, Gd, Ta, He, Ar, and Kr are
signiﬁcantly higher. The uncertainties on our elemental abundances usefully calibrate the unresolved discrepancies
between standard Earth models under various geochemical and geophysical assumptions.

1. Introduction

The number of known rocky exoplanets is rapidly increasing. Transit photometry and radial velocity measure-
ments, when combined, yield rough estimates of the densities and therefore mineralogies of these exoplanets. In-
dependent and potentially more precise estimates of the chemical composition of these rocky planets can be made
based on the known elemental abundances of their host stars combined with estimates of the devolatilization process
that produced the rocky planets from their stellar nebulae. To proceed with this strategy, we need to quantify the
devolatilization that produced the Earth from the solar nebula. Knowledge of the bulk elemental abundances of the
Earth with uncertainties is an important part of this research. The elemental abundances of bulk Earth (including both
the bulk silicate Earth and the core) can tell us a more complete story of the potentially universal accretion and frac-
tionation processes that produce rocky planets from nebular gas during star formation. Uncertainties associated with
the bulk Earth composition are needed to compare and quantify compositional diﬀerences between the Earth, Sun,
and other solar system bodies. Such comparisons can lead to a more detailed understanding of devolatilization and

the chemical relationship between a terrestrial planet and its host star. The bulk Earth elemental abundances will help
determine what mixture of meteorites, comets and other material produced the Earth (Drake and Righter, 2002; Bur-
bine and O’Brien, 2004) and can also help determine the width of the feeding zone of the Earth in the protoplanetary
disk (Chambers, 2001; Kaib and Cowan, 2015).

There are many stages of compositional fractionation between the collapse of a stellar nebula, the evolution of a
proto-planetary disk and a ﬁnal rocky planet. Composition- and position-dependent diﬀerences in the duration and
strength of the various fractionating processes can lead to a variety of outcomes. The diﬀerent (but somewhat similar)
compositions of Earth, Mars and Vesta are a measure of these variations within our own Solar System.

A major challenge to estimating the bulk chemical composition of the Earth is that we can only sample the upper
part of the possibly heterogeneous mantle, and we have no direct access to its deep interior, and even less to the
core (All`egre et al., 2001). Early studies on primitive mantle (PM) elemental abundances include O’Neill (1991),
Kargel and Lewis (1993), McDonough and Sun (1995), and O’Neill and Palme (1998). Bulk elemental abundances
with uncertainties (All`egre et al., 2001) were reported 16 years ago but much work on PM abundances and on core
abundances (usually separately) has been done since then (e.g., Lyubetskaya and Korenaga, 2007; Palme and O’Neill,
2014; Rubie et al., 2011; Wood et al., 2013; Hirose et al., 2013). The determination of uncertainties is central to the
quantiﬁcation of elemental abundances but has been a missing priority in previous work. The most recent, highly cited
estimates of the elemental abundances of the bulk Earth do not include uncertainties (McDonough, 2003; McDonough
and Arevalo, 2008).

Elemental abundance discrepancies are in large part model-dependent (McDonough, 2016), but over the past
15 years progress has been made in making more plausible models. Our knowledge of the core (and therefore of the
bulk Earth) has increased signiﬁcantly: high pressure experiments yield improved partition coeﬃcients of siderophiles
(Siebert et al., 2013) and improved aﬃnities of light elements for iron (Ricolleau et al., 2011; Mookherjee et al., 2011).
Seismic velocites through the core provide increasingly precise constraints on densities and on mineral physics models
(Voˇcadlo, 2007; Li and Fei, 2014; Badro et al., 2014). Better subduction models (Poitrasson and Zambardi, 2015) and
estimates of the degree of homogeneity of the mantle (Javoy et al., 2010; Nakajima and Stevenson, 2015; McDonough,
2016) provide new constraints that are being included in the upper and lower mantle abundance estimates. Better
observations of geo-neutrinos (Bellini et al., 2010; Gando et al., 2011; Bellini et al., 2013; Gando et al., 2013) provide
new thermal constraints for the abundances of heat-producing elements in the Earth (e.g. Sramek et al., 2013; Huang
et al., 2013). The large majority of the literature on elemental abundances of the Earth, involving either the analysis
of the PM or of the core, are increasingly important and when combined, yield improved elemental abundances of the
bulk Earth composition and more realistic uncertainties.

Our main research goal is to analyze the compositional diﬀerences between the Earth, Sun and other solar system
bodies and from this comparison quantify the devolatilization of stellar material that leads to rocky planets. This
requires estimates of the bulk Earth abundances with uncertainties. These bulk abundances and their uncertainties are
poorly constrained and often ignored in the literature. Motivated by this, we make a concordance estimate of the bulk
Earth elemental abundances and their uncertainties. The words “concordance estimate” speciﬁcally mean a composi-
tional estimate that is representative of, and concordant with previous estimates. The aim of this work therefore is not
to resolve the discrepancies between competing models and assumptions but to construct a concordance model (with
uncertainties) that represents current knowledge of bulk Earth composition and calibrates unresolved discrepancies.
We envisage that if the discrepancies can be resolved, a better formulation for estimating uncertainties might be forth-
coming. However, at this stage, some of the arguments concerning the derivation of models, or values resulting from
these models, appear intractable. Nevertheless, there is an essential need for uncertainties in the estimates if we are to
make progress in comparing planetary objects.

We organize this paper as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the concordance estimate for the composition of PM.
In Sect. 3 we present the concordance estimate of the core; in Sect. 4 we make a new estimate (with uncertainty)
of the core mass fraction of the Earth, using it as the weighting factor to combine the PM with the core to yield our
concordance estimates for the bulk Earth. In Sect. 5 we discuss details of how our work diﬀers from previous work
and some unresolved issues that might aﬀect our results.

2. Composition of the Primitive Mantle

2.1. Data sources

Earth’s primitive mantle (PM) or bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is the mantle existing after core segregation but before
the extraction of continental and oceanic crust and the degassing of volatiles (Sun, 1982; Kargel and Lewis, 1993; Saal
et al., 2002; McDonough, 2003; Lyubetskaya and Korenaga, 2007; Palme and O’Neill, 2014). There are two major,
and partially-overlapping modeling strategies for estimating the PM composition.

The peridotite model is based on the analysis of chemical data from basalts and periodotite massifs. Peridotite-
basalt melting trends yield an estimate of the PM composition (e.g., Ringwood, 1979; Sun, 1982; McDonough and
Sun, 1995; McDonough, 2003; Lyubetskaya and Korenaga, 2007). The peridotite model has a number of intrinsic
problems, including the non-uniqueness of melting trends, large scatter in the data from mid-ocean ridge basalts
(MORB) and from ocean island basalts (OIB), and the diﬃculty of imposing multiple cosmochemical constraints on
refractory lithophile element (RLE) abundances, often resulting in model-dependent, poorly quantiﬁed uncertainties
(Lyubetskaya and Korenaga, 2007).

The cosmochemical model is based on the identiﬁcation of Earth with a particular class of chondritic or achondritic
meteorites or their mixtures (e.g., Morgan and Anders, 1980; Javoy et al., 2010; Fitoussi et al., 2016), along with a
number of assumptions on accretion and fractionation processes (All`egre et al., 2001). The cosmochemical model
uses chondritic ratios of RLEs and volatility trends (e.g., Wanke and Dreibus, 1988; Palme and O’Neill, 2003, 2014).
Palme and O’Neill (2003) and Palme and O’Neill (2014) present a core-mantle mass balance approach for calculating
the primitive mantle composition. This approach requires an accurate determination of magnesium number (Mg # =
molar Mg/(Mg+Fe)). A reasonable range for Mg# can be inferred from fertile mantle periodites.

Our aim is not to resolve the diﬀerences between these strategies and models but to construct a concordance model

whose mean values and uncertainties adequately represent current knowledge and disagreement.

2.2. Concordance PM Estimate

We construct our concordance PM abundances from three major papers reporting PM abundances (Lyubetskaya
and Korenaga, 2007; McDonough and Arevalo, 2008; Palme and O’Neill, 2014), supplemented with noble gas abun-
dances from Marty (2012) and Halliday (2013). McDonough and Arevalo (2008) is an updated version of their
pioneering peridotite model (McDonough and Sun, 1995; McDonough, 2003). Updates of some abundances, for ex-
ample W, K and Pb, can be found in Arevalo and McDonough (2008) and Arevalo et al. (2009). Lyubetskaya and
Korenaga (2007) performed a principal component analysis of the same peridodite database but with diﬀerent model
parameters. Palme and O’Neill (2014) is largely based on a cosmochemical model using mass balance and is an
updated version of their pioneering earlier work (Palme and O’Neill, 2003).

Challenges to combining these three data sets are:
i) McDonough and Arevalo (2008) report no uncertainties, however the PM abundance uncertainties reported in
McDonough and Sun (1995) approximately reﬂect current uncertainties. Thus, in our analysis, we attach them to the
PM abundances reported in McDonough and Arevalo (2008).

ii) Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007) do not report abundances of four volatiles; C, H, N, O.
iii) Palme and O’Neill (2014) do not report uncertainties for C, N, Se, Te, In, Hg and Bi, while Lyubetskaya and
Korenaga (2007) do not report uncertainties for Te, In, Hg, Bi, Ag, Cd and Tl. We assign the McDonough and Sun
(1995) uncertainties to these elements.

iv) none of these three PM models include noble gas abundances. In a preliminary attempt to be more compre-
hensive, we supplement these three PM models with recent noble gas abundances: the atmospheric model of Marty
(2012) and three diﬀerent models (layered mantle, impact erosion, and basaltic glass) from Halliday (2013). This
range encompasses recent results from Dauphas and Morbidelli (2014) (Marty et al., 2016). See Appendix A.1 for
details.

The resultant concordance estimates for the PM elemental abundances and their uncertainties, are listed in column
3 of Table 1. Our PM elemental abundances are increased by 0.3% to ensure that the sum of all the ppm values equals
106 (see Appendix C). Figs. 1 & 2 show the comparison of our concordance abundances with the literature values.
The upper panel of Fig. 1 shows elemental abundances (ppm by mass). The literature abundances normalized to our
concordance PM abundances are shown in the lower panel. For clarity, Fig. 2 is a zoomed-in version of the 13 most
abundant elements in Fig. 1. The abundances of these 13 elements account for 99.93+0.07

−0.72 wt% of primitive mantle.

By construction, our concordance PM abundances are consistent with the literature abundances. There are some
outliers. For example, the Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007) abundances of Cl and Br are relatively low because they
used the Cl/K ratio of 0.0075±0.0025 from highly depleted MORB in Saal et al. (2002). This ratio is ∼ 10 times lower
than an equivalent Cl/K ratio of ∼ 0.07 used in McDonough and Arevalo (2008) (which came from the Cl/Rb ∼ 28 and
K/Rb ∼ 400 of McDonough and Sun, 1995). The abundances of K estimated in Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007)
and McDonough and Arevalo (2008) are consistent (190±76 ppm and 240±48 ppm, respectively), resulting in the
abundance of Cl in Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007) ∼ 12 times lower than that in McDonough and Arevalo (2008).
Based on a 10% partial melting MORB and the mass balance, Palme and O’Neill (2014) estimate a total CI content of
30 ppm for PM, ∼ 21 times higher that that (∼ 1.4 ppm) in Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007). The Lyubetskaya and
Korenaga (2007) abundance of Br comes from the Cl/Br ratio of ∼ 400±50, which is the same ratio used in Palme and
O’Neill (2014) and is higher than the approximate 350 (McDonough and Arevalo, 2008; McDonough and Sun, 1995).
Thus, the Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007) Br abundance is also low and inconsistent with that of McDonough and
Arevalo (2008) and of Palme and O’Neill (2014). Because of this inconsistency, we use an unweighted mean for Cl
and Br (see Appendix A.1). As a result, the ratio of our estimated Cl and Br abundances is ∼ 376.

Figure 1: Recent literature estimates of 83 elemental abundances in the primitive mantle (PM) and our concordance estimates (green) constructed
from them. Elements are plotted in order of decreasing PM abundance. The upper panel plots ppm by mass. In the lower panel, literature values
have been normalized to our PM concordance estimates. Our PM concordance ppm estimates have been rescaled up by 0.3% to ensure that their
sum equals 106. We have not rescaled the literature values (see Appendix C for rescaling details). The light green band in the lower panel indicates
our estimate of the uncertainties on the concordance values. 64% of the literature points fall within this band. The string of relatively low values
for RLEs in the middle of the plot for the Lyubetskaya and Korenaga (2007) data set is due to its relatively high Mg abundance. Upper limits that
extend beyond the plot range are labeled with their y-values. The dashed boxes on the left in both panels contain the 13 most abundant elements
and are zoomed-in on in Fig. 2.

3. Composition of the Core

3.1. Data sources

The density deﬁcit of the Earth’s core (compared to a pure Fe-Ni composition) suggests that the core contains a
signiﬁcant amount of one or more light elements. The liquid outer core is thought to have a density deﬁcit of 3 − 12
wt% (e.g., Stevenson, 1981; Anderson and Ahrens, 1994; Anderson and Isaak, 2002; McDonough, 2003), while the
solid inner core is 3-6 wt% less dense than predicted (e.g., Anderson and Ahrens, 1994; Hemley and Mao, 2001). The
candidate light elements are still controversial and have been modeled and estimated in various ways and plausibly
include Si, O, S and C (see reviews by Hirose et al., 2013; Litasov and Shatskiy, 2016).

We have compiled and combined a wide variety of recent work to construct concordance core abundances. These are
listed in Tables 1 and 2 and include various constraints from various core compositional models, terrestrial fraction-
ation curves and mass balance (e.g. Kargel and Lewis, 1993; All`egre et al., 1995; McDonough, 2003; Wood et al.,
2006; McDonough and Arevalo, 2008), metal-silicate equilibrium (e.g. Rubie et al., 2011), the chemistry of core for-
mation (e.g. Javoy et al., 2010), high-pressure and high-temperature experiments (Siebert et al., 2013), experiments
based on sound velocity and/or density jumps (Huang et al., 2011; Nakajima et al., 2015), and numerical simulations
(e.g. Zhang and Yin, 2012; Badro et al., 2014).

3.2. Concordance Core Estimate

Since many core abundances reported in the literature are model-dependent and are given without uncertainties,
our concordance abundances (Tables 1 and 2) are unweighted averages (Eq. A.3) and exclude abundances that have
been set to zero. Based on mass balance between the core and the silicate Earth, McDonough (2003) proposed both
Si-bearing and O-bearing core models while McDonough and Arevalo (2008) presented a Si-bearing model only. The
trace elements in the McDonough (2003) O-bearing model and McDonough and Arevalo (2008) Si-bearing model
are highly correlated. Therefore we only count them once in our calculations. The details of how the literature values
were combined into our concordance values with uncertainties are described in Appendix A.2.

Fig. 3 shows our concordance abundances for 49 elements in the core, compared with the literature values from
which they were constructed. The sum of our concordance abundances of the 49 elements is scaled to 106 and listed
in column 5 of Table 1. This is the most complete compilation for the core’s composition to date. Table 2 lists the
mean concordance concentrations of the 13 most abundant elements in the core along with the literature values from

8

which they were constructed. Fig. 4 is a zoom-in of the 13 most abundant elements and shows this comparison in
more detail. Fe-Ni alloy accounts for 87.90±2.92 wt% of the total mass of the core. The most abundant light element
in the core is Si, followed by O, S, and C. The other less abundant elements include Cr, P, Mn, Co, Na, Mg and H.

Figure 3: Recent literature estimates of 49 elemental abundances in the Earth’s core and our concordance estimates constructed from them.
Elements are plotted in order of decreasing core abundance. The upper panel plots ppm by mass. In the lower panel, literature values have been
normalized to our core concordance estimates. The grey band in the lower panel indicates our estimate of the uncertainties on the concordance
values. 79% of the literature points fall within this band. The dashed boxes on the left in both panels contain the 13 most abundant elements and
are zoomed-in on in Fig. 4. Our core concordance ppm estimates have been rescaled down by 2.0% to constrain their sum to equal 106. We have
not rescaled the literature values (see Appendix C, Table C.4).

4. Composition of the Bulk Earth

4.1. The Core Mass Fraction

The elemental abundances of bulk Earth are the weighted average of the elemental abundances of primitive mantle
and core. The accuracy of bulk Earth abundances therefore depends on the accuracy of the core mass fraction.
However, literature values of the core mass fraction (Table 3) vary, and none has a reported uncertainty.

Our calculation of the core mass fraction is based on the two standard Earth radial density proﬁle models: PREM
(Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981) and ak135 (Kennett et al., 1995). We take 3480±1 km for the core-mantle boundary
(CMB) and 1218±3 km for the inner core boundary (ICB) (Souriau and Calvet, 2015). We take 5972.2±0.6 ×1021 kg
as the total mass of the Earth1. This recent update of the Earth’s mass is due to more precise (and accurate) estimates of
Newton’s constant. We renormalize the radial density proﬁles of core and mantle to this new lower Earth mass, which
results in an overall density lower by 0.00158 g/cm3. We assume a typical uncertainty of 1% in the density proﬁle
models (Brian Kennett, personal communication). We include the correlation between core and mantle densities, the
uncertainties of the ICB and the CMB, and the fact that an increase of radius can be compensated by a lower density.
fic = 1.630 ± 0.004 wt% and of the outer
Thus, we obtain estimates for the mass fraction of the inner core ( fic):
foc = 30.840 ± 0.296 wt%. The mass fraction of the total core is fic + foc = fcore = 32.5 ± 0.3 wt%.
core ( foc):
Correspondingly, the weighting factors for estimating the bulk Earth composition are fcore and 1 − fcore for the core
and PM respectively (Eq. A.5).

4.2. Concordance Bulk Earth Estimate

Based on our concordance estimates of the elemental abundances of the primitive mantle and core, we estimate the
bulk elemental abundances of the Earth with their weighted sum ( Eq. A.5 ). The resultant bulk Earth composition and
its associated uncertainty ( Eq. A.6 ) are listed in column 7 of Table 1. The construction of bulk Earth abundances from
primitive mantle and core for each element is plotted in Figs. 5a and 5b to demonstrate the geochemical diﬀerentiation
between PM and core. In Fig. 5b we normalize the elemental abundances of PM and core to the concordance bulk
Earth abundance and plot them as a function of 50% condensation temperature (Lodders, 2003).

5. Discussion

5.1. Comparison with Previous Estimates

Compared to our concordance values, the abundances of some elements reported by McDonough (2003) and
McDonough and Arevalo (2008) are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (where the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence can only be
based on our reported uncertainties). Relative to our values, their abundances for Mg, Cr, Br, Sn, Cd, B and Be are
signiﬁcantly higher, while their abundances for O, Na, Mn, Zn, Ga, Li, Rb, Nb, Ta and In are signiﬁcantly lower,
where “signiﬁcant” means their value is outside our estimate of the uncertainty (Figs. 6 & 7).

The bulk elemental abundances with uncertainties in All`egre et al. (2001) were determined systematically by a
carbonaceous chondrite correlation line, in combination with the abundances of siderophile and chalcophile elements
in All`egre et al. (1995). These works largely depend on the accuracy of the analyses of CI, CM, CO and CV meteorites
compiled in Wasson (1988). For many elements, their mean values and/or their uncertainties are diﬀerent from our
results. For example, relative to our values, the All`egre et al. (2001) abundances for O, Si, Mg, Sn, Rh, B and
Cd are high, while their abundances for Fe, K, Cl, Zn, N, F, Ga, Tl, He and Ar are low. One reason for these
diﬀerences are the diﬀerent assumptions made. For example, the estimate of nitrogen abundance in the Earth in
All`egre et al. (2001) is based on the atmospheric inventories while our estimate is based on the comparison of Earth’s
mantle with carbonaceous chondrite data in McDonough and Arevalo (2008) and Palme and O’Neill (2014). This
latter assumption is more widely accepted and better constrained. All`egre et al. (2001) deduced Earth’s chlorine
abundance from the Cl/Ba ratio in MORB, while our PM sources (Lyubetskaya and Korenaga, 2007; McDonough
and Arevalo, 2008) derived Cl from the Cl/K ratio in MORB (Sect. 2.2). Other reasons for the abundance diﬀerences
and diﬀerences in uncertainties are updates to PM and core abundances, and the use of slightly diﬀerent core mass
fractions: McDonough (2003) or McDonough and Arevalo (2008) (32.3 wt%), All`egre et al. (2001) (32.5 wt%), and
this work (32.5±0.3 wt%).

Based on Eq. B.1, we quantify the signiﬁcance of the deviation of our concordance bulk Earth abundances from
previous estimates (All`egre et al., 2001; McDonough, 2003; McDonough and Arevalo, 2008). Among our new bulk
elemental abundances, 6 elements (Mg, Sn, Br, B, Cd and Be) are more than ∼ 1σ below previous estimates, and 14
elements (Na, K, Cl, Zn, Sr, F, Ga, Rb, Nb, Gd, Ta, He, Ar, and Kr) are more than ∼ 1σ above previous estimates (see
Table B.4).

The reasons for these signiﬁcant abundance diﬀerences include diﬀerent assumptions and our inclusion of updated
PM and core abundances. Mg and Na are the most abundant elements for which our new estimates deviate by more
than ∼ 1.5σ from previous estimates. Our Mg PM abundance of 22.3±0.2 wt% is ∼ 2.5σ lower than the 22.8 wt%
of McDonough and Arevalo (2008) and ∼ 5σ lower than the 23.4 wt% of All`egre et al. (2001) (deduced from their
15.8 wt% Mg bulk abundance and a 67.5 % PM mass fraction). Our lower bulk Earth Mg abundance predominantly
comes from the lower PM Mg abundance in Palme and O’Neill (2014). Our bulk Earth Na abundance is higher than
McDonough and Arevalo (2008) and All`egre et al. (2001) because unlike those authors, we have included Na in the
core:1372±519 ppm (Kargel and Lewis, 1993).

Palme and O’Neill (2014) state that the 6 most abundant elements in the PM make up 98.41 ± 0.01 wt%. We get
a signiﬁcantly higher value with a much larger uncertainty: 98.96 ± 0.72 wt%. McDonough (2016) states (based on
chondritic models) that Fe, O, Si and Mg make up more than 90% of the mass for the bulk Earth and the addition of
Ni, Ca, Al and S accounts for more than 98% by mass. Consistent with these estimates, we ﬁnd 92.99± 1.45 wt% for
Fe, O, Si and Mg and 98.59+1.41

−1.47 wt% with the addition of Ni, Ca, Al and S.

with the latest compilation (Palme et al., 2014) of CI chondritic abundances. In Fig. 8, we have normalized both
the bulk Earth and PM abundances to the highly refractory element Al and CI chondrites. More speciﬁcally, for a
generic elemental abundance X, for the bulk Earth we plot: (X/Al)Earth/(X/Al)CI and for the concordance PM we
plot: (X/Al)PM/(X/Al)CI. This ﬁgure can be directly compared with Fig. 1 of Wood et al. (2006), Fig. 1 of Carlson
et al. (2014) and Fig. 21 of Palme and O’Neill (2014). Those three ﬁgures have been normalized to Mg and CI
chondrites. Because of their large abundances, Mg or Si have often been chosen as a normalization reference element
(McDonough, 2003; Palme and O’Neill, 2014; Carlson et al., 2014; Litasov and Shatskiy, 2016). However both Mg
and Si are not strictly refractory elements. They both have condensation temperatures slightly lower than the transition
or critical temperature (∼ 1400 K), below which the devolatilization of the Earth, compared to CI, is clear. Thus, with
an Mg normalization, a slight depletion of bulk Earth Mg compared to CI chondritic Mg, is misrepresented as an
enrichment of refractory lithophiles.

Our PM analysis does not include estimates from Javoy et al. (2010) who only report the PM abundances of ten
elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe, Al, Ca, Ti, Ni, Cr, and Co) based on their enstatite chondrite model. If these abundances
were included in our analysis they would lower Al, Ca and Ti without lowering the other RLEs such as Be, Sc, Sr,
Nb, REE (Rare Earth Elements), Th and U. Also, enstatite chondrites are silica-enriched (but oxygen depleted?), from
which it is problematic to construct the silica-poor (peridotitic) terrestrial model (Fitoussi and Bourdon, 2012; Jellinek
and Jackson, 2015).

Figure 8: Our concordance bulk Earth and primitive mantle abundances normalized to Al and CI chondrites. Thus, for a generic element X, the
bulk Earth (blue dots) we plot: (X/Al)Earth/(X/Al)CI and analogously for the concordance PM (square points) we plot: (X/Al)PM/(X/Al)CI . Both
are plotted as a function of 50% condensation temperatures (Lodders, 2003). CI abundances and uncertainties are from Table 3 of Palme et al.
(2014), except for the uncertainties of the noble gases which we have set at the same ±50% uncertainty of Hg.

Unresolved Issues

We have assumed that the bulk Earth consists of the primitive mantle and the core, and that the primitive mantle
is a reservoir with the composition of the present-day Earth’s mantle, crust and surface inventories taken together.
Contributions of late accretion to the formation of a secondary atmosphere of the Earth introduces some ambiguity
to this deﬁnition. We also neglected Earth’s primary atmosphere (likely dominated by H and He) formed at the stage
of solar nebula. In limiting our calculations to the prevalent standard models of the PM (Lyubetskaya and Korenaga,
2007; McDonough and Arevalo, 2008; Palme and O’Neill, 2014) we ignore the possible heterogeneity between the
lower mantle and the upper mantle. Impact erosion is another issue that could have changed the PM abundances
of incompatible lithophile elements. If we considered the impact erosion model of O’Neill and Palme (2008), for
example, the PM abundance of K would decrease by about a factor of 2.

Recently, based on i) a high PM abundance of the chalcophile element In, ii) nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies
and iii) high- and low-pressure-temperature metal-silicate partitioning data, Wang et al. (2016) suggested that Earth’s
moderately volatile element composition may not be chondritic.

Another concern could be that we compute weighted averages when combining the elemental abundances of the
primitive mantle while we compute unweighted averages for the core. Considering the global consistency of the PM
abundance datasets (i.e., Lyubetskaya and Korenaga, 2007; McDonough and Arevalo, 2008; Palme and O’Neill, 2014),
computing weighted averages is appropriate. Unlike the PM, core compositional models are much more complex and
mixed with experimental data. Furthermore, uncertainties are not given in the majority of reported core compositional
estimates, so computing weighted averages is not an option.

The degree to which the bulk compositions of Venus and Mars are diﬀerent from the Earth (Morgan and Anders,
1980; Wanke and Dreibus, 1988) or broadly similar (Taylor, 2013; Kaib and Cowan, 2015; Fitoussi et al., 2016) is
still unclear.

6. Summary and Conclusions

As the solar nebula condensed, evaporated and fractionated to form the early Earth (Wood et al., 2006; Carlson
et al., 2014), the chemical composition of the bulk Earth was set. From a heterogeneous set of literature values,
we present the most complete lists of the elemental abundances with uncertainties of the primitive mantle (PM), the
core and the bulk Earth (Table 1, Figs. 1-4,6,7). The four most abundant elements (O, Mg, Si, and Fe) make up
94.19±0.69% of the total PM mass. Fe-Ni alloy accounts for 87.90±2.92 wt% of the total mass of the core, and the
major light elements in the core are Si, O, S, C, Cr, Mn, P, Co, Na, Mg and H in order of decreasing abundance. The
concordance bulk Earth abundances with uncertainties come from the weighted average of our concordance PM and
core. The weighting factor for this average comes from our new estimate (with uncertainty) of the core mass fraction
of the Earth: 32.5±0.3 wt%. Our concordance estimate of bulk Earth composition is largely consistent with recent
bulk elemental abundance estimates; 70% of the previous bulk elemental abundances are within the uncertainties of
our concordance bulk elemental abundances. Compared to previous work, the most signiﬁcant diﬀerences include:
1) our abundances of Mg, Sn, Br, B, Cd and Be are more than ∼ 1σ lower, and 2) our abundances of Na, K, Cl, Zn,
Sr, F, Ga, Rb, Nb, Gd, Ta, He, Ar and Kr, more than ∼ 1σ higher (Table B.4). This set of concordance estimates
(with uncertainties) for the elemental abundances of PM, core and bulk Earth provides a reference that can be used
to compare the Earth to the Sun, which will lead to a more precise devolatilization pattern, potentially applicable to
exoplanets and their host stars.

Appendix A. Concordance Estimates

(cid:80) 1/σ2

i

σ2 =

(cid:80) 1/σ2

(A.2)

where the index i refers to a data set and ranges from 1 to N. For most PM abundances N = 3. Since Lyubetskaya and
Korenaga (2007) did not report abundances for C, H, N and O, N = 2 for these elements. Lyubetskaya and Korenaga
(2007) abundances for Cl and Br are inconsistent with Cl and Br from the other two data sets. Therefore, for these 2
elements, our concordance abundance is the unweighted mean (Eq. A.3) and we take as its uncertainty the range from
the highest to the lowest reported abundance.

We have treated noble gases diﬀerently. Marty (2012) using an atmospheric model and Halliday (2013) using three
diﬀerent models (layered mantle, impact erosion, and basaltic glass) report the molar abundances of non-radiogenic
nuclides of noble gases (3He, 20Ne, 36Ar, 84Kr, 130Xe). We convert these to atomic abundances (by number) by
dividing by their estimated terrestrial primordial isotopic fractions (Lodders et al., 2009). We then convert to mass
ppm using the atomic weights from Wieser et al. (2013). Our concordance PM abundances for noble gases are the
median value of the highest upper limit and the lowest lower limit among the four models. We use the upper and lower
limits as the uncertainty.

Appendix A.2. Concordance Core Estimates

Since the literature core abundances are more scattered and model-dependent than the PM abundances, we com-
pute our concordance core abundances as unweighted means and assign the standard deviations as uncertainties using:

X = 1

N − 1
Little work has been done on trace elements in the core. Kargel and Lewis (1993) and McDonough and Arevalo
(2008) provide estimates for many trace elements but their estimates are not independent. Thus Eq. A.4 severely
under-estimates the uncertainty on the abundances of these trace elements. To compensate for this underestimate, we
do the following. If the standard deviation from Eq. A.4 is smaller than ±40% we assign an uncertainty of 40% (which
is the average of the uncertainies of the 10 most abundant elements in the core). If the standard deviation computed
from Eq. A.4 extends beyond the range of the reported values, we report the range of values as the uncertainty. For
those elements with only one reported value (i.e. N=1), Eq. A.4 is undeﬁned. For these cases, we report as an
uncertainty either ±40%, or the uncertainty on the single point, whichever is larger.

(A.4)

Appendix A.3. Approach for concordance bulk Earth estimate

The concordance elemental abundances of the bulk Earth for each element are computed by

X = Xcore fcore + XPM(1 − fcore)

(A.5)

where, fcore is the core mass fraction estimated in Sect. 4.1. The uncertainty σX, associated with the bulk elemental
abundance, is calculated by the error propagation of the three uncertainties: σXPM , σXcore , and σ fcore of the PM elemental
abundance, the core elemental abundance, and the core mass fraction, respectively:

In Figs. 7 & 8 we compare our concordance bulk estimates with three previous estimates of bulk Earth abundances.

Appendix C. Rescaling Data

Elemental abundances are usually reported in ppm by mass. Thus, when all elements are estimated, the sum of
their abundances should equal 106. The abundances of all elements are usually not reported. We use this Σ ppm = 106
constraint to rescale our PM, core (and thus our bulk) abundances. Our concordance PM abundances summed to
0.997×106 so we rescaled all of our PM abundances up by 0.3%. Our concordance core abundances summed to 1.020×
106 so we rescaled all of our core abundances down by 2.0%. In Table C.5 we sum the literature abundances (column
3). In column 4 we supplement the sums from column 3 with our rescaled concordance abundances. Deviations from
1.000 × 106 in column 4 indicate the level of inconsistency in the literature with the Σ ppm = 106 constraint, even
after the missing elements have been supplemented with our concordance abundances.
