Multi-electron dynamics in atoms and molecules very often occur on sub- to few-femtosecond
timescales. The available intensities of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulses have previ-
ously only allowed the time-resolved investigation of two-photon, two-electron interactions. Here
we demonstrate attosecond control over double and triple ionization of argon atoms involving the
absorption of up to ﬁve XUV photons. In an XUV-pump XUV-probe measurement using a pair of
attosecond pulse trains (APTs), the Ar2+ ion yield exhibits a weak delay dependence, suggesting
that its generation predominantly results from the sequential emission of two electrons by photoab-

function of the delay, which is a signature of the simultaneous absorption of at least two XUV pho-
tons. The experimental results are well reproduced by numerical calculations that provide detailed
insight into the ionization dynamics. Our results open up new opportunities for the investigation
and control of multi-electron dynamics and complex electron correlation mechanisms on extremely
short timescales.

Strong laser ﬁelds can be used to induce multi-electron dynamics in atoms and molecules [1, 2]. For example, in the
commonly used near-infrared (NIR) regime, techniques like high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy have helped
to identify multi-electron processes, such as the rearrangement of electrons in molecules upon photoionization [3]
and collective multi-electron eﬀects in atoms [4]. However, the use of NIR ﬁelds comes at the cost of strongly
perturbing the system and involves a strong bending of the atomic and molecular potentials. The high complexity
of the contributing processes then often makes a detailed understanding of the underlying physics diﬃcult. A better
control over multi-electron dynamics can be achieved by ionizing atoms and molecules using XUV photons, for which
ponderomotive eﬀects are small. Even the absorption of a single XUV photon can trigger multi-electron dynamics, e.g.
via Auger cascades [5]. Accordingly, XUV-pump XUV-probe experiments are a promising route to provide in-depth
understanding of multi-electron dynamics, where one or more photons may be absorbed from both the pump and the
probe lasers in order to produce multiply charged ions. Using state-of-the-art technology, such experiments can now
be performed with attosecond to few-femtosecond time resolution. Indeed, two-photon, two-electron interactions have
been observed with a temporal resolution down to 1.5 fs [6] and 500 as [7].

The absorption of two XUV photons by an atom resulting in its double ionization may occur either in a direct
or a sequential process. In the latter case, one electron is emitted following the absorption of a ﬁrst XUV photon,
and an intermediate ionic state is formed. Another electron is emitted when a second XUV photon is subsequently
absorbed. Various experimental techniques have been applied to distinguish between direct and sequential XUV-
induced processes in single-pulse experiments, including intensity-dependent studies [8] and the investigation of recoil-
ion momentum distributions [9]. Previous experiments aimed at characterizing the XUV pulse duration used a pair
of XUV pulses and relied on selecting suitable photon energies that favor direct two-photon-induced two-electron
emission over the sequential absorption of two XUV photons [10, 11].

The investigation of XUV-induced multi-photon multi-electron dynamics with attosecond time resolution has so
far been hindered by the lack of suitable light sources. While extremely high XUV intensities can be obtained at
free-electron lasers [12], it has only recently become possible to generate attosecond pulses and attosecond pulse trains
at these facilities [13–15]. At the same time, attosecond pulses can be routinely generated using HHG [16]. Recently,
intense XUV pulses from HHG sources have been demonstrated, allowing the observation of multi-photon absorption.
In Ar and Xe atoms, this has led to the observation of ion charge states up to Ar5+ [17–19] and Xe5+ [20]. In order
to understand the underlying ionization mechanisms, attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spectroscopy represents a
promising tool.

Here we present the results of an XUV-pump XUV-probe experiment in Ar using a pair of attosecond pulse trains
(APTs) with an intensity envelope of ≈ 3 fs [21], and covering a photon energy range from 16 − 34 eV. Using photons
in this photon energy range, Ar2+ can be produced by both two- and three-photon processes, see Fig. 1(a). The
absorption of two photons may take place in a direct (1) or sequential (3) two-photon process. In the ﬁrst case, two
electrons are emitted following the simultaneous absorption of two photons. In the second case, Ar+ is formed after
the absorption of a ﬁrst XUV photon, followed by the absorption of a second XUV photon and the emission of a second
electron. Ar2+ may further be produced by three-photon absorption (2), involving a sequence of a one-photon step
leading to Ar+ and a two-photon process leading to Ar2+. For the generation of Ar3+, six likely pathways are shown,
including a direct three-photon process (4) and a fully sequential pathway involving four single-photon absorption
steps via intermediate states Ar+, Ar2+ and Ar2+* (9). Note that a high density of excited states of Ar2+ (indicated
by the dashed lines and the gray area) lie within the photon energy range of the used APTs [22]. Pathways (5) - (8)
involve sequences of one-, two-, and three-photon absorption. Further pathways are possible, but were not found to
be important in this work.

To study the non-linear multi-photon ionization of argon with attosecond resolution, we applied a recently developed
XUV intensity scaling scheme using an 18-m-long HHG beamline, see Fig. 1(b) [18]. High harmonics were generated
in a 30-cm-long gas cell ﬁlled with Xe using 9-fs-long NIR pulses centered around 800 nm from an optical parametric
chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation (OPCPA) system [23]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), two replicas of the APT were generated by
a split-and-delay unit. The pulses were focused onto a jet of Ar atoms using a split B4C-coated spherical mirror with
a focal length of 75 mm. An XUV peak intensity of 1 × 1014 W/cm2 was estimated for each APT (see Methods). The
generated ions were recorded using a velocity-map imaging spectrometer (VMIS) [24] that was operated in spatial-map
imaging mode [25].

In what follows, we will present measurements of the Ar2+ and Ar3+ yields as a function of the delay between the two
APTs. Our aim is to identify the dominant mechanisms responsible for the Ar2+ and Ar3+ formation (see Fig. 1(a))
on the basis of the measured delay dependence. In order to do so, we will compare the measured delay dependence
with results of theoretical calculations including the mechanisms shown in Fig. 1(a). It should be emphasized that
theoretical modeling of the experiment is extremely challenging, since the experiment collects signals from an extended
focal volume where the two APTs overlap and interfere with each other, leading to a complicated XUV intensity and

pulse shape distribution within the focal volume. Since, as a result, the computation of focal volume averaged
results is unfeasible, we have ﬁrst characterized the role of focal volume averaging in a simpliﬁed model, where we
have calculated non-resonant two-photon ionization using XUV pulses obtained in a previous simulation using realistic
NIR pulses [21]. These calculations show that to a good approximation the experiment can be considered and modeled
as an intensity autocorrelation (see Supplementary Information). Therefore, this approximation will be used within
this paper.

RESULTS

We have performed two types of measurements: In the ﬁrst type of measurement, the two APTs were spatially
overlapped, and the time delay between the two APTs was varied. The measured Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion yields as a
function of the XUV-XUV time delay are presented in Fig. 2(a). The Ar2+ yield (red curve) exhibits only weak
oscillations with an oscillation amplitude of about 10 %, whereas the Ar3+ ion yield (blue curve) shows strong
oscillations with an oscillation amplitude of about 2 as a function of the time delay between the two APTs. The

FIG. 2: Measured Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion yields as a function of the XUV-XUV temporal and spatial
overlap. (a) The Ar2+ ion yield (red curve) is only weakly modulated as a function of the XUV-XUV time delay,
whereas clear oscillations with a period of 1.3 fs are observed in the delay-dependent Ar3+ ion yield (blue curve).
Error intervals given by the red- and blue-shaded areas are standard deviations obtained as the statistical error of
four scans. Note that the absolute Ar3+ yield is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the absolute Ar2+
yield. (b) At a delay of 20 fs between the two APTs, the Ar2+ ion yield (red curve) is enhanced by a factor of 1.6
when the XUV pulses spatially overlap, while an enhancement of 3.2 is observed for Ar3+ (blue curve). The
combination of these results show that the formation of Ar2+ is dominated by a sequential pathway, whereas both
sequential and direct processes are important for the generation of Ar3+.

period of the oscillations is about 1.3 fs, which corresponds to half the oscillation period of the NIR laser and suggests
a strong enhancement of the Ar3+ yield when individual attosecond pulses in the pump and probe APTs overlap.
In the second type of measurement, the two APTs were delayed by 20 fs with respect to each other, and the focus
position of one of the APTs was scanned in lateral direction with respect to that of the other. As shown in Fig. 2(b),
the Ar2+ ion yield was increased by a factor of 1.6 and the Ar3+ ion yield was increased by a factor of 3.2 when the
APTs spatially overlapped. Taken together, these experiments allow us to better understand the importance of both
direct and sequential multi-photon processes.

In order to assess the relative importance of direct and sequential processes, we ﬁrst of all make the observation
(which is based on the afore-mentioned focal volume averaged simulations, see Sec. II of Supplementary Information)
that, except at zero delay, sequential two-photon two-electron ionization does not depend on the delay between the two
APTs. In contrast, direct two-photon, two-electron ionization is about twice as eﬃcient when the APTs temporally
overlap as opposed to when they do not, since the peak intensity is twice as high when the two APTs overlap. We
stress that this result is only obtained when realistic APTs resulting from simulations of our XUV source are used.
It thus follows from the observed amplitudes of the oscillations in the Ar2+ signal (Fig. 2(a)) that at least 10 %
of the Ar2+ yield is due to direct ionization, whereas up to 90 % is due to sequential processes. With regard to
the second experiment, where the two APTs were delayed by 20 fs with respect to each other, we argue that in
the absence of ground-state depletion (see Sec. III of Supplementary Information) the yield of Ar2+ resulting from
direct ionization does not depend on whether or not the two APTs are spatially overlapped. By contrast, given
that sequential ionization scales quadratically with the ﬂuence, it is expected that the contribution from sequential
ionization doubles when the two APTs spatially overlap. It follows that the 60 % increase in the Ar2+ yield in the
latter case suggests that at least 60 % of the Ar2+ formation occurs by means of a sequential process and up to 40 %
by a direct process. Combining both observations, we thus estimate that about 10-40 % of the Ar2+ formation occurs
by direct two-photon two-electron emission, and the remainder by sequential processes.

The experimental results for Ar3+ suggest that its formation takes place in a sequence of steps, of which at least
one step involves the absorption of two or more XUV photons. Due to the large number and the complexity of the
possible pathways, a deﬁnite assignment to one of the pathways shown in Fig. 1(a) is not possible. However, when
one makes the assumption that Ar3+ is generated via the Ar2+ ground state (i.e. the ﬁrst two XUV photons are

FIG. 3: Simulated Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion yields as a function of the XUV-XUV time delay. (a) The
simulated Ar2+ ion yield (red curve) exhibits small delay-dependent changes of about 10 %, while the relative Ar3+
ion yield (blue curve) varies by a factor of almost 2. These results are in good agreement with the experimental
results shown in Fig. 2. Case 1 and case 2 are two time delays for which the time-dependent ion formation is shown
in Fig. 4. (b) Contributions to the Ar2+ ion yield as a function of XUV-XUV time delay, dominated by sequential

delay.

preferentially absorbed sequentially), the most relevant pathways would be (5) and (9). The strong modulation of the
Ar3+ ion yield as a function of the time delay (Fig. 2(a)) would then mean that pathway (9) can be ruled out and
that pathway (5) dominates.

Deeper insights into the non-linear multi-photon ionization of Ar can be obtained by modeling, which will be
described in the following. To be able to account for the broad bandwidth of the XUV pulses, a Monte Carlo technique
was developed that computed the ﬁnal ion yields and the pathways leading to the formation of the ions. Single-photon
and direct two- and three-photon ionization processes were accounted for (see Methods and Supplementary Information
for details). In the simulations, a pair of short APTs were used (see gray-shaded area in Fig. 4(a)), as previously
obtained from HHG simulations [21]. We note that it was not possible to implement the formation of excited ions in
the model.

The simulated Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion yields as a function of the time delay between the two APTs are presented in
Fig. 3(a). While the Ar2+ ion yield exhibits weak oscillations with an amplitude of about 10 %, the Ar3+ ion yield
strongly oscillates and is about twice as high at zero delay as compared to the case of non-overlapping pump and
probe pulses. These results are in good agreement with the experimental observations (Fig. 2(a)).

The contributions of diﬀerent pathways leading to the generation of Ar2+ and Ar3+ are shown in Fig. 3(b)+(c).
The formation of Ar2+ (Fig. 3(b)) is dominated by a sequential pathway involving two single-photon absorption steps
(pathway (3) (blue curve) in Fig. 1(a)), and shows almost no delay dependence. Further contributions stem from
pathways (1) (red curve) and (2) (black curve), which involve a direct two-photon absorption step. These contributions
are responsible for the weak oscillations observed in Fig. 3(a). The dominance of a two-photon sequential pathway as

2 in Fig. 3), see the gray-shaded areas for the corresponding eﬀective XUV pulses. In both cases, ionization occurs
in a stepwise fashion due to the APT structure.

obtained from the simulations is consistent with the analysis of the experimental results.

The generation of Ar3+ (Fig. 3(c)) is found to be dominated by a three-step sequence of two one-photon and
one two-photon absorption processes via intermediate states Ar+ and Ar2+ (blue curve, pathway (5) in Fig. 1(a)).
Pathways (6) (black curve) and (8) (red curve) also contribute to the overall Ar3+ ion yield. All these contributions
exhibit clear oscillations as a function of the XUV-XUV time delay. We note that in our simpliﬁed model, we found
that a sequence of three ionization steps results in an increased ion yield by a factor of 4, when the two APTs are
spatially, but not temporally overlapped (see Supplementary Information). Therefore, we note that the experimental
observations, which showed an increase of the Ar3+ ion yield by a factor of 3.2 at spatial overlap and an additional
increase of a factor 2 at temporal overlap between the two APTs, are consistent with pathway (5) playing an important
role for the formation of Ar3+, as predicted by the Monte Carlo simulations.

The numerical simulations provide information on the formation of Ar2+ and Ar3+ ions in the time domain. The
corresponding results are presented in Fig. 4 for XUV-XUV time delays of (a) 0 fs and (b) 0.66 fs (see the gray-shaded
areas for the corresponding eﬀective XUV pulse structures). As a result of the APT structure, the ion formation
occurs in steps in both cases. The increase of the Ar3+ ion yield in Fig. 4(a) is particularly large in the temporal
window between 1.1 and 1.6 fs. This is a consequence of the fact that the Ar3+ ion formation depends both on the
instantaneous Ar2+ ion population and the instantaneous XUV intensity.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Our results demonstrate that the application of intense attosecond pulse trains opens the way to better understand
complex multi-photon multi-electron dynamics. In our study, the combination of temporally and spatially resolved
measurements applied to diﬀerent ionic species made it possible to separately study the role of direct and sequential
multi-photon processes. Therefore, the demonstrated method has the potential to investigate in detail the complex
and highly non-linear multi-photon ionization of atoms and molecules observed at free-electron lasers, which resulted
in charge states up to Xe48+ [12, 26, 27], Ne10+ [28] and I47+ [27].

The high XUV intensities obtained here furthermore pave the way for attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spec-
troscopy at higher XUV photon energies, a regime that is typically diﬃcult to access because of low HHG conversion
eﬃciencies. This could make it possible to study multi-electron dynamics and electron-electron correlation following

the removal of core electrons in atoms and molecules with attosecond resolution. Examples include the study of
Auger cascades and double Auger decay processes, in which the relaxation of a valence-shell electron to an inner-shell
vacancy leads to the sequential or simultaneous emission of two Auger electrons [5].

Experimental methods
In the experiments, 8.5 mJ NIR pulses were used, and the pulse energy was further reduced to 6 mJ during the
HHG optimization process using a motorized iris. Rather than maximizing the XUV pulse energy as is done in most
loose-focusing HHG setups, an XUV intensity scaling scheme was applied which optimizes the XUV peak intensity
by reducing the XUV waist radius [18]. Considering that the total beamline length was 18 m, a spherical mirror with
a relatively short NIR focal length of 5 m was used, and the distance from the NIR focal plane to the XUV focusing
mirror was 13 m, leading to a large demagniﬁcation of the XUV beam size [18]. High harmonics were generated
in a 30-cm-long gas cell ﬁlled with Xe, where NIR propagation eﬀects were previously shown to play an important
role [21]. A 100-nm-thick Al ﬁlter was used to block the fundamental light. The XUV beam was split and delayed
using two sections of a spherical mirror with a focal length of 75 mm and a boron carbide (B4C) coating. In the
current experiments, we estimate that each XUV focusing mirror reﬂected about 40 % of the XUV beam, leading
to a beam waist radius that was estimated to be 1.3 µm in the vertical direction [18] and 2.5 × 1.3 µm= 3.25 µm
in the horizontal direction. The width of the Ar2+ ion yield distribution as a function of the spatial displacement
of one of the APTs (Fig. 2(b)) is consistent with the estimation of the XUV beam waist radius. Assuming an XUV
pulse energy of 10 nJ that was reﬂected from each mirror and using the simulated APT structure (see Fig. 4) [21],
the XUV peak intensity of each pulse was estimated as 1 × 1014 W/cm2. Ar atoms were injected by a piezoelectric
valve [29], and the central part of the atomic beam was selected by a molecular beam skimmer with an oriﬁce diameter
of 0.5 mm. Ions in diﬀerent charge states were recorded using a velocity-map imaging spectrometer [24] that was
operated in spatial-map imaging mode [25]. The ion yields of individual ion charge states were recorded by gating
the microchannel plate / phosphor screen detector.

Numerical methods
A Monte-Carlo technique [30] was employed to compute the ion yields and the pathways leading to the formation of
the ions. Namely, starting from an initial state, we accessed only one energetically allowed state at a time, which is
determined in a stochastic manner [26, 31, 32]. Moreover, due to the ﬁnite bandwidth of the XUV pulses, at each
time step of the propagation, using a method referred to as importance sampling [33], one, two, and three photons
in the energy interval from 15.9 eV to 33.7 eV were selected to account for the respective multi-photon process. The
importance sampling distribution is given by the experimentally determined spectrum of the XUV pulse. To compute
single-photon cross sections, a formalism previously developed to describe single-photon ionization processes in argon
was used [34]. Employing a scaling method described in Ref. [35], two- and three-photon cross sections for argon
were estimated as 10−50 cm4s and 10−84 cm6s2, respectively. These approximate values are in agreement with two-
and three-photon cross sections previously obtained to describe the interaction of XUV pulses with argon [36] and
neon [37]. A more detailed description of the numerical methods is given in the Supplementary Information.
