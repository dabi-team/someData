Abstract –We present a comprehensive analysis of photon emission and atomic collision processes
in two-phase argon doped with xenon and nitrogen. The dopants are aimed to convert the VUV
emission of pure Ar to the UV emission of the Xe dopant in the liquid phase and to the near
UV emission of the N2 dopant in the gas phase. Such a mixture is relevant to two-phase dark
matter and low energy neutrino detectors, with enhanced photon collection eﬃciency for primary
and secondary scintillation signals. Based on this analysis, we show that the recently proposed
hypothesis of the enhancement of the excitation transfer from Ar to N2 species in the two-phase
mode is either incorrect or needs assumption about a new extreme mechanism of the excitation
transfer coming into force at lower temperatures, in particular that of the resonant excitation
transfer via ArN2 compound (van der Waals molecule).

Introduction. – Currently two types of two-phase
detectors are being used for dark matter search by a num-
ber of groups worldwide: those based on liquid xenon [1–3]
and liquid argon [4, 5]. In addition, the use of argon- and
xenon-based two-phase detectors was proposed for coher-
ent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments [6, 7]. A key
aspect of two-phase detectors is the simultaneous record-
ing of primary scintillation (S1) and primary ionization
(S2) signals [8–10], providing selection of nuclear recoil
events induced by elastic collisions with dark matter par-
ticles or low energy neutrinos. Both S1 and S2 signals are
optically read out in the liquid and gas phase respectively,
the S2 signal being recorded via secondary scintillation
(proportional electroluminescence).

In Xe, having a photon emission band in the Ultraviolet
(UV), around 175 nm, the S1 and S2 signals are recorded
directly: using cryogenic PMTs with quartz windows. In
contrast in Ar, having a photon emission band in the Vac-
uum Ultraviolet (VUV), around 128 nm, the signals are
recorded indirectly: using cryogenic PMTs combined with
a Wavelength Shifter (WLS), typically TPB [4], to convert
the VUV into the visible range. In this case the photon
collection eﬃciency might be considerably reduced, by a
factor reaching 20 [11], due internal reﬂection and conver-

sion eﬃciency losses in the WLS and in the absence of
optical contact between the WLS and the PMT window.
Accordingly, it looks attractive to shift the VUV emis-
sion of Ar to longer wavelength directly in the detection
medium, to do without the WLS. It is known that at room
temperature such a VUV-to-UV conversion can be eﬀec-
tively performed in gaseous argon by doping with either
xenon [12,13], at a content of 0.1-10%, or nitrogen [13–15],
at a content of 0.2-2%, and in liquid argon by doping with
xenon [16–22], at a content of 10-1000 ppm.

In two-phase Ar, doping with Xe is eﬀective only in the
liquid phase, since in the gas phase the saturated Xe vapor
pressure is as low as 0.031 Torr at 87.3 K [23], which for
example at Xe content of 1000 ppm in the liquid results in
vanishing Xe content in the gas phase, of 40 ppb (accord-
ing to Rault’s law).
In addition, doping liquid Ar with
even minor amount of N2 (≥10 ppm) results in quenching
the VUV emission [24, 25], without any re-emission in the
UV. Consequently at ﬁrst glance, the VUV-to-UV conver-
sion in two-phase Ar would be possible either for the S1
signal in the liquid phase, using Xe dopant, or for the S2
signal in the gas phase, using N2 dopant, but not for both
the S1 and S2 signals.

On the other hand, the recent results on electrolumi-

nescence yield in two-phase Ar doped with a rather small
amount of N2, at a content of 50 ppm, were explained
by a hypothesis that 50% of emitted photons were due
to N2 emission [11, 26]. This hypothesis implies that the
excitation transfer from Ar to N2 species is substantially
enhanced at 87 K compared to room temperature. Given
such a low N2 content, one could be tempted to use a
ternary mixture of argon doped with xenon and nitrogen,
in which the N2 dopant in the liquid is supposed to do not
interfere with that of Xe.

In this paper, we try to resolve these questions through
careful analysis of energy levels, photon emission bands
and reaction rate constants of Ar, Xe and N2 species rel-
evant to the performance in the two-phase mode.

The present study was performed in the course of the
development of two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detec-
tors (CRADs) of ultimate sensitivity for rare-event exper-
iments [27–30].

Ternary mixture of Ar doped with Xe and N2.
– As a speciﬁc example, we examine here a hypothetical
ternary mixture of Ar doped with Xe and N2, at a content
of 1000 ppm and 50 ppm in the liquid and 40 ppb and 135
ppm in the gas phase, respectively. The dopant contents
in the gas phase were deﬁned according to Rault’s law,
from the saturated vapor pressure data at 87 K [23]. The
data on energy levels, photon emission bands and reaction
rate constants of Ar, Xe and N2 species are compiled here
over the past 50 years.

Fig. 1 shows the data relevant to this mixture and to
the two-phase detector performance, i.e. when the excita-
tion is due to ionization or electroluminescence: the energy
levels of the lower excited and ionized states, the radiative
transitions observed in experiments and the most proba-
ble non-radiative transitions induced by atomic collisions
for Ar, Xe and N2 species and their pair combinations
(Ar+Xe and Ar+N2). Table 1 explains and elaborates
Fig.1, presenting basic reactions of excited species for a
given mixture, relevant to the performance in the two-
phase mode, their rate (k) or time (τ ) constants reported
in the literature and their time constants reduced to given
atomic densities at 87 K (τT P ).

The latter constants allow to rank the reactions on
importance in case of parallel competing reactions: the
smaller the time constant of the reaction, the larger its
contribution. When calculating these constants, the sec-
ond and third order reactions were reduced to pseudo-ﬁrst
order reactions, because the second and third species are
present here in large excess with respect to the excited
ones [31]. For example, the reduced time constant of re-
action (1) is τT P = 1/(k1[Ar]2), while that of reaction (6)
is τT P = 1/(k6[N2]).

Below an overview of the reactions of Table 1 is given.
In gaseous Ar, there are four lowest excited atomic states
Ar∗(3p54s1): those of two resonance (3P1 and 1P1) and
two meta-stable (3P2 and 3P0). These excited states and
three-body collision reaction (1) are responsible for the

2 excimer production in a singlet (1Σ+

Ar∗
u ) or triplet (3Σ+
u )
state [45–48],
followed by their radiative decay in the
VUV, at 128±12 nm (reaction (2)) [12, 16, 48–52]. The
singlet and triplet states provide the fast and slow emis-
sion component respectively. Besides the VUV emission,
the excited Ar atoms in the gas phase emit in the Near
Infrared (NIR), at 690-850 nm, due to the higher excited
atomic states Ar∗(3p54p1) (reaction (3)) [40, 41, 53–57].
Due to the large uncertainty in the reaction (1) rate con-
stant measured at room temperature, its reduced time
constant at 87 K is deﬁned only within an order of magni-
tude: τT P ∼13 ns. Here and below the weak temperature
dependencies of the rate constants [46] were neglected.

Despite the relatively large rate constants of reactions
(4) and (5), describing the excitation transfer from Ar∗
and Ar∗
2 states to Xe [12,13,58,59], their contributions are
negligible due to the extremely low Xe content in the gas
phase: compare their τT P to those of reactions (1) and
(2).

N∗

2(C) versus Ar∗

2 emission in the gas phase. –
Reaction (6) is responsible for the VUV-to-UV conver-
sion in the gas phase: it describes two-body collisions of
Ar∗ states with N2 molecules, producing N∗
2(C3Πu) ex-
cited states (N∗
2(C) for short) [13, 45, 47, 60]; it competes
with reaction (1). Here the rate constant at room temper-
ature is known within a factor of 2 [45,47,58,60], resulting
in that the N∗
2(C) fraction of all the Ar+N2 reaction prod-
ucts may range from 50 to 100% (compare to reaction (7)).
Reaction (6) is followed by reaction (8): by N∗
2(B)
radiative transition in the near UV, emitting the so-called
2nd Positive System (2PS) at 310-440 nm [13, 45, 47, 61].
According to its rate constant measured at room tem-
perature, reaction (6) would not be able to compete with
reaction (1) at such a small (135 ppm) N2 content:
its
τT P =2.4 µs would be at least a factor of 180 larger than
that of reaction (1). What confuses is that recently the
opposite thing has been reported [11,26], namely that 50%
of photons produced due to Ar∗ species in the gas phase
at 87 K might be emitted by those of N∗
2(C), at N2 con-
tent in the liquid of 50 ppm. This was explained by the
hypothesis that the excitation transfer from Ar to N2 is
enhanced at 87 K compared to room temperature.

2(C)→N∗

Given the analysis performed, we tend to believe that
such hypothesis can hardly be true, leading us to the con-
clusion that the experimental data of [11] are incorrect.
Otherwise one should assume an extreme mechanism of
atomic collisions at which the rate constant of reaction (6)
at 87 K is increased by a huge factor (≥180), compared
to that of room temperature; below, in the last-but-one
section, we will examine this possibility.

The excited N∗

2(C) states can be quenched in collisions
with Ar and N2 species in reaction (10) and (12); in partic-
ular reaction (10) competes with reaction (8), somewhat
limiting the photon yield of the 2PS emission.

Reaction (9) can follow reaction (8), (10) and (12):

it
describes N∗
2(A) radiative transition in the NIR,
emitting the 1st Positive System (1PS) at 500-2500 nm
[42–45]. At normal and higher pressures the 1PS emis-
sion is suppressed due to its large time constant (9 µs)
and quenching reactions (11) and (13). For the same rea-
son, we do not consider here the N∗
2(A)→N2(X) radiative
transition, since its time constant is as large as several ms
[44].

Reaction (14) is similar to reaction (5);

it describes
quenching of Ar∗
2 species in collisions with those of N2.
In the gas phase its contribution is inessential due to the
large time constant.
In contrast in the liquid phase, it
may play an important role in quenching the VUV emis-
sion (see below reaction (23)).

in Ar, to the Ar∗(n = 1, 2P3/2) and Ar∗(n = 1, 2P1/2)
excitons [35], which reﬂect the 3P1 and 1P1 levels of the
Ar∗(3p54s1) atomic states. According to reaction (15), the
excitons are immediately trapped in singlet or triplet ex-
cimer states Ar∗
u ) [25, 62]. These states have lower
energy levels with respect to the N∗
2(C) states (see Fig. 1);
that is why the 2PS emission in the UV had never been ob-
served in liquid Ar doped with N2. The singlet (1Σ+
u ) and
triplet (3Σ+
u ) excimers provide the fast and slow emission
components in the VUV (reaction (16)).

Photon emission and atomic collision processes in two-phase argon doped with xenon and nitrogen

2(1,3Σ+

2(1,3Σ+

Reactions (17)-(21), describing the excitation transfer
from Ar∗
u ) excimers to those of Xe∗
u ), are the
major reactions responsible for the VUV-to-UV conversion
in the liquid phase due to Xe dopant. At the ﬁrst stage,
Xe excitons are produced in excitation transfer from Ar∗
2
excimers in reaction (17) [17–20]; it competes with reac-
tion (16). Similarly to Ar, the Xe∗(n = 1, 2P3/2) and
Xe∗(n = 1, 2P1/2) excitons in liquid Ar reﬂect the 3P1
and 1P1 levels of the Xe∗(5p56s1) atomic states; in addi-
tion, a Wannier-Mott exciton Xe∗(n = 2, 2P3/2) locates
in-between [22, 35, 38]. The radiative transition between
the latter and the lower exciton band (reaction (22)) is
responsible for the NIR emission observed at a smaller Xe
content (<100 ppm) [21, 22].

The time constant of reaction (17), 1.4 ns [17–19] and 5-
90 ns [18,20] for collisions with the singlet and triplet Ar∗
2
excimers respectively, make this reaction 5-20 times faster
than reaction (16) (compare to τ16 in Table 1), giving the
latter no chance to happen.

At the second stage, the Xe∗ excitons transform to
Xe∗
2(1,3Σ+
u ) excimers in two ways: either via intermedi-
ate heteronuclear excimers ArXe∗, in successive collisions
with Ar and Xe atoms (reactions (18) and (19)) [18–20],
or directly in collisions with Xe atoms (reaction (20)) [16].
The ﬁrst way is preferred since the Xe∗ exciton trapping
in collisions with Ar atoms (reaction (18)) is believed to
occur as fast as reaction (15), i.e. practically immediately
[19]. On the other hand, the second way cannot be fully
excluded for a smaller Xe content (<100 ppm), since re-
action (22) may indicate on the presence of free-migrating
Xe∗ species. Anyway, the rate and time constants mea-
sured for reactions (17)-(19) [18–20] can be used here to es-
timate the overall time for reactions (17)-(21): it amounts
to ≤110 ns.

2, ArXe∗ and Xe∗

This should be compared to the time constants of com-
petitive reactions (23)-(25), describing the non-radiative
quenching of Ar∗
2 excimers in collisions
with N2 molecules. The rate constants of the two latter
reactions are assumed to be close to that of (23), which
was measured with rather good accuracy [24, 25], result-
ing in the reaction time constant of 250 ns. According
to kinetics equation for two parallel reactions [31], the
quenching reactions contributions would be thus less than
(1/τ23)/(1/τ23+1/τ17−21)=30%.

Accordingly, one may conclude that the Xe dopant to
liquid argon at a content of 1000 ppm may successfully
perform its job on VUV-to-UV conversion with an eﬃ-
ciency of >70%, even in presence of N2 impurity at a con-
tent of ≤50 ppm.

On the resonant excitation transfer from Ar to
N2. – The hypothesis of the enhancement of the excita-
tion transfer from Ar to N2 species in the gas phase at 87
K [11] can only be explained if we assume a new mecha-
nism of atomic collisions, namely a resonance behavior of
Ar+N2 collision cross-section induced by emergence of a
certain bound state around 87 K. It is amazing that such

a bound state was actually observed as ArN2 compound
(van der Waals molecule) [64, 65], emerging at temper-
atures below 105 K with a binding energy of 9.6 meV
(which is very close to the thermal energy at 87 K). Thus
we might suppose that reaction (6) may proceed at 87 K
via ArN2 compound in the following resonant reactions:
(I) Ar∗ + ArN2 → Ar + Ar∗N2 ,

Ar∗N2 → ArN ∗

2 (C) → Ar + N ∗

2 (C) ;

(II) Ar∗ + N2 → Ar∗N2 → ArN ∗

2 (C) → Ar + N ∗

2 (C) .

These might considerably enhance the excitation trans-
fer from Ar to N2. In particular, the cross-section of the
ﬁrst reaction might be very large since it includes a reso-
nant excitation transfer reaction Ar∗ + Ar → Ar + Ar∗,
which is known to have an extremely large cross-section,
reaching σ∼10−12 cm2 [66]. The rate constant derived
hereof is k=σv=3×10−8 cm3 s−1 (v is the average relative
velocity).

Now the problem is reduced to a question how big
the fraction of N2 species bound in ArN2 compound is.
It is easy to show that to be consistent with the esti-
mates for reaction (6) deduced from ref. [11] and pre-
sented in Table 1, k6≥6.5×10−9 cm3 s−1, this fraction
should exceed 20%. On the other hand, our theoreti-
cal estimation showed that this value should be a fac-
[ArN2]/[N2]∼1%. Here we used the
tor of 20 smaller:
theoretical calculations of the chemical equilibrium coef-
ﬁcient for Ar2 [67] and ArH2 [68] compounds (deﬁned as
keq = [ArN2]/[N2][Ar]), given its temperature and bind-
ing energy dependence [69] to extrapolate to the ArN2
case.

Finally we conclude that the interpretation of the exper-
imental data in [11] is most probably incorrect and that
the eﬀect of the resonant excitation transfer from Ar to
N2, if exists, starts at a much higher N2 content, of about
1000 ppm.

Conclusion. – In this work, a comprehensive analy-
sis of energy levels, photon emission bands and reaction
rate constants in two-phase argon doped with xenon and
nitrogen, at a content of 1000 ppm and 50 ppm respec-
tively, has been presented. Such a mixture is relevant to
two-phase dark matter and low energy neutrino detectors,
with enhanced photon collection eﬃciency for primary and
secondary scintillation signals.

Based on this analysis, it is shown that Xe dopant may
successfully perform its job on VUV-to-UV conversion in
the liquid phase even in presence of N2 impurity, if its
content does not exceed 50 ppm.

On the other hand, the recently proposed hypothesis
of the enhancement of the excitation transfer from Ar to
N2 [11] which was supposed to provide the VUV-to-UV
conversion in the gas phase, is most probably incorrect
at such a small N2 content. We showed that if even to
assume a new extreme mechanism of excitation transfer
coming into force at lower temperatures, namely the res-
onant excitation transfer via ArN2 compound (van der
Waals molecule), it presumably starts at a much higher
