The ﬂow in an evaporating glycerol-water binary sub-millimeter droplet with Bond number Bo
(cid:28) 1 is studied both experimentally and numerically. First, we measure the ﬂow ﬁelds near the
substrate by micro-PIV for both sessile and pendant droplets during the evaporation process, which
surprisingly show opposite radial ﬂow directions – inward and outward, respectively. This observa-
tion clearly reveals that in spite of the small droplet size, gravitational eﬀects play a crucial role in
controlling the ﬂow ﬁelds in the evaporating droplets. We theoretically analyze that this gravity-
driven eﬀect is triggered by the lower volatility of glycerol which leads to a preferential evaporation
of water then the local concentration diﬀerence of the two components leads to a density gradient
that drives the convective ﬂow. We show that the Archimedes number Ar is the nondimensional
control parameter for the occurrence of the gravitational eﬀects. We conﬁrm our hypothesis by ex-
perimentally comparing two evaporating microdroplet systems, namely a glycerol-water droplet and
a 1,2-propanediol-water droplet. We obtain diﬀerent Ar, larger or smaller than a unit by varying a
series of droplet heights, which corresponds to cases with or without gravitational eﬀects, respec-
tively. Finally, we simulate the process numerically, ﬁnding good agreement with the experimental
results and again conﬁrming our interpretation.

The evaporation of a microdroplet on a ﬂat substrate
has attracted a lot of attention because of its beautiful
and phenomenologically rich ﬂuid dynamics [1–14] and
its relevance in various technological applications, such
as medical diagnostics [15] and the fabrication of elec-
tronic devices [16]. For many of these applications, an
understanding of the internal ﬂow structure is crucial.
One example is the so-called “coﬀee stain problem” [2],
i.e. an evaporating colloidal drop in which an outward
capillary ﬂow along the substrate carries the dispersed
material from the interior towards the pinned contact
line. This seminal study opened up a new line of research
for surface coatings and patterning technologies, which is
crucial for various applications in inkjet printing [17], 3D
printing technology [18] and molecular biology [19].

However, in nearly all of these applications, the droplet
liquid is not pure, but a binary or even ternary liq-
uid. As is well known, then Marangoni ﬂow, which
is coming into
is driven by surface tension gradients,
play [6, 20–23], strongly aﬀecting the evaporative be-
havior. The variation of the surface tension originates
from two mechanisms or the combination of both, namely
a temperature gradient [20, 21] or a solute concentra-
tion gradient [13, 22–26], due to the spatially varying
local evaporation rates at the droplet surface. The con-
ventional understanding is that the ﬂows within sub-
millimeter droplets can only be attributed to capillary
and Marangoni convections, while natural convection
is considered to be negligible as the surface tension
force is dominant compared to gravity forces [21]. The
Bond number of such a small-sized droplet system reads

Bo = ρgR2/γ (cid:28) 1, which normally implies a gravity-
independent system [27]. However, this only holds as
a measure of the importance of the gravity force com-
pared to the surface tension while relating to the droplet
shape [28]. In recent years, studies of evaporating aque-
ous NaCl droplets revealed that natural convection can
be driven by evaporation-induced density gradients inside
a colloidal droplet [29–33]. However, to our best knowl-
edge, an internal ﬂow controlled by gravitational eﬀects
has never been observed, nor experimentally conﬁrmed
in a drying microdroplet consisting of two miscible liquid
components.

In this work, we investigate the ﬂow ﬁeld inside
an evaporating glycerol-water binary miscible droplet.
Glycerol is a very common liquid heavily used in indus-
try [34] and laboratory experiments [35], in particular
due to its strong hygroscopic nature [36]. Recently, Shin
et al. [37] found a spontaneous B´enard-Marangoni (BM)
convection within the water-glycerol system: the hygro-
scopic absorption of water vapor at the interface gener-
ates thermal and solutal gradients, leading to a surface
tension gradient, thus sustaining a BM instability. They
conﬁrmed that buoyancy is not the driving force by ob-
serving the same convection cells when orienting the sys-
tem upside-down. Here, however, we study the reverse
process to absorption: the evaporation of a dilute aque-
ous glycerol droplet. In this system, glycerol can be con-
sidered nearly non-volatile under room temperature as
compared to water, implying a selective evaporation of
the more volatile water, which leads to a concentration
gradient of the components in the drying droplet. Such

a concentration gradient generates surface tension and
density gradients, which drives a convective ﬂow in the
droplet. Remarkably, the ﬂow ﬁeld is mainly controlled
by the buoyancy force through the density gradient.

We implemented microparticle image velocimetry
(µPIV) to measure the ﬂow ﬁelds within the binary
droplets with opposite conﬁguration: a sessile and a
pendant droplet. We deposited (0.18 ± 0.03) µL bi-
nary droplets (glycerol:water, 50:50% by weight), seeded
with ﬂuorescent microspheres (520 nm diameter) at a
concentration of 2 × 10−2 vol% on a OTS glass sub-
strate (see Supplemental Materials [38]). Glycerol has
a higher density ρg = 1.261 × 103 kg/m3 and lower sur-
face tension γg = 64 × 10−3 N m−1 than water (ρw =
0.998 × 103 kg/m3, γw = 75 × 10−3 N m−1). During
evaporation, the ambient temperature and relative hu-
midity were stable, i.e., T = 21 ± 1 ◦C and RH = 50 ±
5 %. During the drying process the contact angles θ for
both the sessile and the pendant droplet were between
90◦ to 104◦. A typical droplet initially has a footprint
radius R0 = 400 µm and a height h0 = 490 µm. We
investigate the ﬂow ﬁelds for both sessile and pendant
droplets by adjusting the optical focus plane at diﬀerent
heights within the droplets: at 10 µm (i) and at 200 µm
(ii) away from the substrate, as labeled in Fig 1. For
sessile droplets, we observe an inward radial ﬂow in the
middle of the droplet (a1) and an outward radial ﬂow
close to the base of droplet (a2). Fig 1.(a3) presents the
schematics of the ﬂow velocity within the axis plane of
the droplet from side view: the black arrows represent
the measured ﬂow velocities and the red arrows indicate
the ﬂow pattern reconstructed from the measurement. In
contrast, Fig 1.(b1,b2) show a completely reversed ﬂow
ﬁelds for pendant droplets. The ﬂow velocity near the
substrate (b2) is radially outward, from center towards
the contact line, which is opposite to the one of sessile
droplet (b2). In the middle of the droplet (b1), it shows
relatively weaker inward radial ﬂow only in the outer re-
gion and asymmetric annulus ﬂow near the edge of the
droplet. Fig 1.(b3) illustrates the ﬂow pattern in a pen-
dant droplet.

The opposite radial ﬂow directions near the substrate
of diﬀerently orientated droplets clearly indicates that
the gravitational eﬀect is dominating to control the ﬂow
structure. In our system, the gravitational eﬀect is driven
by the density gradient in the bulk of the droplet, which
in turn is generated from concentration gradients in-
duced by the selective evaporation of the more volatile
water. As the density of the glycerol-water mixture
monotonously increases with increasing glycerol concen-
tration, the local density decreases from the outer layer
towards the inner bulk. For the sessile droplet, the denser
glycerol-rich part is collecting on the top of the droplet,
resulting in an unstable situation: denser glycerol-rich
part suspends atop lighter water-rich part. As sketched
in Fig 1.(a3), the lighter liquid part rises up due to the

2

buoyancy, pushing the denser liquid to sink along the
outer layer, hence an inward ﬂow is passively driven from
the contact line towards the center in the bottom layer.
In contrast, for pendant droplets, the glycerol-rich part
is at the bottom of the liquid bulk which cannot drive a
buoyancy ﬂow in the center. Instead, the denser liquid
near the contact line ﬂows down along the outer layer,
and is replenished by the outward radial ﬂow close to
the substrate, implying a much weaker gravitational ef-
fect in the pendant droplet. Moreover, due to the intense
coupling between composition and ﬂow, instabilities can
arise which lead to axial symmetry breaking near the in-
terface [22, 43].

We can estimate the ﬂow velocity in the evaporating
binary droplet by scaling arguments. The typical ve-
locity from the µPIV results is U ≈ 10 µm s−1 so that
the Reynolds number Re = ρU R/µm ≈ 10−4, where
µm ≈ 5 mPa s is the viscosity of the binary mixture. Fur-
thermore, the P´eclet number Pe = U R/D ≈ 10, with
the mutual diﬀusion coeﬃcient D ≈ 0.4 × 10−9 m2/s,
implying advection is dominating over diﬀusion. Assum-
ing a quasi-steady ﬂow, the gravitational force due to
the density diﬀerence is balanced by the viscous shear
stress, which scales as g∆ρm ∼ µ∇2U . The density
ρm of the mixture liquid varies with the relative con-
centration φ following the Boussinesq approximation,
ρm = ρ0[1 + β(φ − φ0) − α(T − T0)] [44], where ρ0, φ0
and T0 denote, the density, concentration ratio and tem-
perature of the reference state, respectively, and where
α and β indicate the thermal and solutal expansion co-
eﬃcient, respectively. Note that the evaporation of wa-
ter cools down the liquid temperature near the surface,
which enhances the density diﬀerence between the sur-
face area and the bulk. For now we neglected the ther-
mal eﬀect and only considered the density changes due to
concentration diﬀerences. This assumption is validated
by numerical simulations (see below) with and without
the thermal contribution with only minor changes to
the ﬂow ﬁeld. Thus the density diﬀerence is given by
∆ρm = ρ0β∆φ, with the solutal expansion coeﬃcient is
β ≈ 0.2.

The evaporation rate is controlled by diﬀusion of wa-
ter vapor molecules to the surrounding air. Therefore,
the mass loss ∆m within a typical timescale ∆t ∼ R/U
can be estimated from ∆m ∼ Dw,air∆Cw,airR∆t, with
Dw,air ≈ 10−5 m2/s is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of water
vapor at room temperature and ∆Cw,air ≈ 10−2 kg/m3
is the water vapor concentration diﬀerence between the
air-liquid interface and the surrounding air. Hence,
the concentration ratio diﬀerence ∆φ can be calculated
from ∆φ ∼ ∆m/m0 ∼ (Dw,air∆Cw,airR∆t)/(2πR3ρ0/3).
Therefore, we obtain the characteristic steady-state ﬂow
velocity Uc as

thus in very good agreement with the velocity estimate
from experiment. Note that Eq. 1 is independent of the
ratio of nonvolatile glycerol to water. We test the ap-
plicability of the scaling approach on various initial mass
concentration of glycerol, ranging from 10% to 60%. The
measured temporal evolutions of the averaged radial ve-
locity near the substrate for sessile droplets are shown in
Fig 2(a). We then rescale the experimental data by the
characteristic velocity Uc and time scale τc. The latter
is estimated by the diﬀusion lifetime of a sessile droplet
[10],

As shown in Fig 2(b), with the rescaling all data collapse,
except the early stages of the droplets with 10% and 20%
initial concentration. We conclude that the gravitational
eﬀect is enhanced by increasing the concentration of glyc-
erol, before reaching the concentration at which glycerol
starts to absorb the humidity from the air.

We now introduce the Archimedes number Ar =
gh3ρ0∆ρ/µ2
m [45] as the control parameter for this prob-
lem, where h is the height of droplets. For large Ar (cid:29) 1
gravity plays a prominent role, whereas for small Ar (cid:28) 1,
the gravity can be neglected. To test the applicability of
Ar, we varied the height of a series of sessile glycerol-
water droplets, with hg = 608 µm, 514 µm, 320 µm and
154 µm. For our system, with a density diﬀerence be-
tween glycerol and water ∆ρg = 263 kg/m3, we obtain

FIG. 2: (a) The evolutions of the averaged radial velocity near
the substrate for sessile droplets with various initial glycerol
mass concentrations, 10% (blue), 20% (red), 30% (orange),
40% (purple), 50% (green) and 60% (cyan). (b) The dimen-
sionless averaged radial velocity plotted against the dimen-
sionless time for the same data as in (a), which are scaled
by the characteristic velocity and life time according to Eq. 1
and Eq. 2 , respectively. All the scaled data collapse into each
other except the early stages of the ones with 10% and 20%
initial concentration.

Ar = 23.1, 14.0, 3.4 and 0.37. A prominent inward ra-
dial ﬂow in the center of the droplets is observed for the
cases when Ar is greater than 1, which indicates gravity-
dominating ﬂow. However, for the case when Ar < 1,
this ﬂow disappears. For comparison, we investigated the
occurrence of gravitational eﬀects in a 1,2-propanediol-
water binary droplet in the same experimental setup.
The density for 1,2-propanediol is 1.036 × 103 kg/m3 at
room temperature, which is slightly greater than that of

water (density diﬀerence ∆ρp = 36 kg/m3) and µp ≈
7 mPa s for the viscosity [46]. As with glycerol, 1,2-
propanediol is also nearly non-volatile at room temper-
ature conditions, resulting in a preferential evaporation
of water. The contact angles θp for sessile and pendant
droplets are between 70◦ and 75◦ due to the low sur-
face tension of 1,2-propanediol [47], indicating a stronger
Marangoni eﬀect than that of the glycerol-water droplets.
We measured the ﬂow ﬁeld in an optical focal plane 10 µm
above the substrate for oppositely conﬁgured droplets
(sessile and pendant) with two diﬀerent droplet heights,
hp ≈ 800 µm and 410 µm, with Ar ≈ 3.7 and 0.5, re-
spectively. We observed the opposite radial outward
ﬂows in large droplets with diﬀerent orientations, simi-
lar to glycerol-water droplets. But for small droplets, we
ﬁnd the same radially outwards ﬂow direction for both
droplets: there is no detecable ﬂow within the center of
the droplet, but only outward radial ﬂow in the outer
regime, which clearly indicates that for these droplets
with low Ar, only the Marangoni eﬀect dominates the
ﬂow near the edge. More details are given in the sup-
plemental materials [38]. The two liquid systems clearly
show that the Archimedes number is indeed the crucial
control parameter for the occurrence of the gravitational
eﬀects.

To validate the experimental results, corresponding ﬁ-
nite element simulations were performed. To that end,
an axisymmetric model [43] was employed, which had
already been successfully validated with binary water-
ethanol and ternary ouzo droplets [48]. The model solves
the diﬀusion equation for the water vapor concentration
Cw,air in the gas phase, assuming vapor-liquid equilib-
rium according to Raoult’s law.
It includes the activ-
ity coeﬃcient [49] of the two components at the liquid-
gas interface and considers the ambient vapor concen-
tration far away from the droplet. The diﬀusive water
vapor ﬂux at the interface determines the volume evo-
lution and the normal component of the velocity in the
droplet and is furthermore used as interfacial sink term
in the convection-diﬀusion equation for the local com-
position in the droplet. The liquid properties, including
the surface tension γ, mass density ρ, viscosity µ, dif-
fusivity D and thermodynamic activity of water aw, are
not constant, but coupled to the composition ﬁeld. The
composition-dependent properties of the glycerol-water
mixture have been extracted from experimental data and
are plotted in Refs.
[43, 50]. While the gravitational
body force has been neglected in the original model [43],
the discussed experimental results clearly indicate the rel-
evance of this term. Hence, the generalized model used
here solves the Navier-Stokes ﬂow inside the droplet with
the composition-dependent body force ρ(cid:126)g in the bulk and
the Marangoni shear stress at the liquid-gas interface.

FIG. 4: Experimental (a1, b1) and numerical (a2, b2) results
for the evolution of the radial velocity near the substrate for
both sessile (a1, a2) and pendant (b1, b2) droplets. Posi-
tive values indicates outward ﬂow. For sessile droplets (a1,
a2), the numerical simulation shows a great agreement with
experiment. However, for pendant droplet (b1, b2), the nu-
merical simulation shows a stronger ﬂow near the contact line
than in the experiment, which is presumably due to the axial
symmetry breaking of the ﬂow in experiment.

parameters.

results, close to the substrate the ﬂow is directed in-
ward/outward for the sessile/pendant droplet, whereas it
is reversed in the bulk layer approximately at the center
of the droplet. Along the liquid-gas interface the simula-
tions reveal a counter-rotating vortex as is apparent from
the Stokes stream function depicted in the right half of
Fig. 3. For the pendant droplet, the ﬂow at the interface
is in the same direction as predicted by pure Marangoni
ﬂow in the absence of natural convection, i.e.
from the
apex towards the contact line. For the sessile droplet,
however, the strong natural convection in the bulk trans-
ports water from the bulk to the apex. Thereby, despite
of the enhanced evaporation rate at the top, there is a
higher water concentration at the apex as compared to
the contact line. This results in a Marangoni ﬂow from
the contact line towards the apex, i.e.
in the opposite
direction as predicted when considering the Marangoni
eﬀect without natural convection. Hence, the impact of
the gravity is not only able to decisively control the ﬂow
direction in the bulk, but can also reverse the interfacial
composition gradient and the corresponding Marangoni
ﬂow.

A quantitative comparison of the experimental and nu-
merical results is shown in Fig 4. Here, the temporal
evolution of the angular-averaged radial velocity of the
micro-PIV measurement in the plane close to the sub-
strate is compared with the numerically obtained radial
velocity evaluated at the same height. It is apparent that
the radial velocity proﬁle is in good agreement for the
entire drying time. For the case of the pendant droplet,
however, the simulation predicts an inward ﬂow region
close to the contact line, which was not found in the
corresponding micro-PIV measurement. This diﬀerence
can presumably be attributed to the assumption of ax-
isymmetry in the model, a condition that may easily be
broken for the pendant droplet system (cf. Fig 1(b1)).

Gravitational eﬀects triggered by density gradients
due to selective evaporation can play a dominating role
in controlling the ﬂow in evaporating multicomponent
droplets, even at the sub-millimeter scale and small Bond
numbers. Misled by the small Bo, hitherto, most stud-
ies on this subject until now have disregarded the in-
ﬂuence of natural convection. Our results show con-
clusively that natural convection can readily dominate
the ﬂow for µL droplets. Thus, our ﬁndings stimulate a
careful treatment of the interplay of natural convection
and Marangoni ﬂow in multicomponent droplets in fu-
ture studies. Furthermore, the possibility to reverse the
bulk ﬂow by overturning the system opens new appli-
cation perspectives for surface coating and particle pat-
terning. –On resubmission of our paper, we got aware of
a reference which came to similar conclusion, however,
employing diﬀerent methods and diﬀerent liquids [51].
