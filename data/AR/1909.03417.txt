existence of two diﬀerent solutions for (Pg) are obtained when f satisﬁes superlinear growth condition. Moreover, we
prove the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions for (P0) if f is odd in u thanks an extension of Clark’s theorem near

Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to the study of the existence and multiplicity results for problems (Pg)
(resp. P0). For this reason, many authors have devoted their attention to problems of this types and they have widely
studied them by using variational methods under various conditions on the potentials V(x), g(x) and K(x) and the
nonlinearity f (x, u) especially when it is superlinear or sublinear at inﬁnity. The paper was motivated by some works
appeared in recent years. Let us start with the nonhomogeneous case g(x) , 0. In [3], Chen-Li studied the following

They showed that there are two constants m0 > 0 (respectively m1 > 0) such that problem (1.1) admits at least

two diﬀerent solutions when

It is well known that under (AR), any Palais Smale sequence of the corresponding energy functional is bounded.
Although (AR) condition is very crucial, there are many super-linear functions which do not satisfy the (AR) condition.

Motivated by the previously mentioned works, elliptic problems involving the Grushin operator have attracted
the attention of many authors, see e.g. [18, 19, 20, 21] and references therein. See also [2, 4, 5, 23, 24] for results

related to a more general class of degenerate operators, namely the ∆λ-Laplace operators. In [5], Kogoj and Lanconelli
investigated the ∆λ-Laplace operator under the additional assumption that the operator is homogeneous of degree two
with respect to a semigroup of dilations in RN. In 2015, Anh and My studied in [2] the following problem

authors showed that the considered problem admits at least one nontrivial weak solution and by the Fountain theorem,
inﬁnitely many weak solutions. In 2017, Chen-Tang-Gao [4] studied (1.4) with V(x) is allowing to be sign-changing

and f is a function with a more general super-quadratic growth, which is weaker than the (AR) condition. By symmet-

Remark 1.1. Rahal-Hamdani [19] studied (1.5) and (1.6) with sign-changing potential V and with the Ambrosetti-
Rabinowitz condition. They got only for the superlinear case the existence of at least one nontrivial solution and
multiple solutions with odd nonlinearity. Here, for the nonlinearity of (Pg) we do not need to be odd and does not
satisfy the Ambrosetti–Rabinowitz condition and then we obtain for the superlinear case two solutions for problem
(Pg) and for the sublinear situation case we prove that (P0) has inﬁnitely many solutions.

Motivated by the papers mentioned above, in the ﬁrst part of this paper, we need to make the following assumption

on the potential V(x):

In what follows, we turn our aim to study the problem (1.7).

The ﬁrst aim of this paper is to study (Pg) under more generic superlinear growth conditions in order to generalize
or to give complementary results to the ones listed above. More precisely, our methods are diﬀerent than the method
used in [4, 19], and we investigate existence of two diﬀerent solutions for (Pg) which one is negative energy solution
and the other is positive energy solution under the following conditions on ˜f and g:

at least two diﬀerent energy solutions in the superlinear case which one is negative energy solution and the other

principle of Mawhin-Willem [16] stated in Section 2.3. Diﬀerently to [7] in the sublinear case (see estimate (1.3)),

To our best knowledge, Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 are new even in the study for the Grushin problem with sign-

In the superlinear case, we will use the following version of Ekeland’s variational principle and the mountain pass
theorem to prove the existence of two diﬀerent solutions. One is negative energy solution and the other is positive
energy solution.

Theorem A. ([16], Ekeland’s variational principle) Let X be a complete metric space with metric d and let I : X

In the sublinear case, we give the improved Clark’ theorem in [14] to prove Theorem 1.4.

The proof of this theorem is divided into two steps.

Step 1: Existence of negative energy solution.
We will prove that there exists a function u0 ∈

Eg such that I′g(u0) = 0 and Ig(u0) < 0.
By the proof of Lemma 3.2 and (H1)–(H3), there exist two constants C1, C2 > 0 such that

Step 2: Existence of positive energy solution.

I′g(u0) = 0 and Ig(u0) = c0 < 0.

(3.14)

Next, we want to apply Theorem B to prove the existence of the other solution.
By Lemmas (3.1)-(3.2), we know that all conditions of the mountain pass theorem (see [17]) are satisﬁed. Thus
applying Lemma 3.3, we can conclude that there exists a function u1 ∈
α0 > 0,

I′g(u1) = 0 and Ig(u1)
