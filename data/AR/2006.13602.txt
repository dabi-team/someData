Magnetic and Velocity Field Topology in Active Regions of
Descending Phase of the Solar Cycle 23

Abstract
We analyse the topology of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and sub-photospheric ﬂows of sev-
eral active regions (ARs) that are observed during the peak to descending phase of the solar
cycle 23. Our analysis shows clear evidence of hemispheric preferences in all the topological
parameters such as the magnetic, current and kinetic helicities, and the ‘curl-divergence’. We
found that 68%(67%) ARs in the northern (southern) hemisphere with negative (positive)
magnetic helicities. Same hemispheric preference sign is found for the current helicities in
68%(68%) ARs. The hemispheric preferences are found to exist statistically for all the time
except in few ARs observed during the peak and the end phases of the solar cycle. This means
that magnetic ﬁelds are dominantly left(right)-helical in scales smaller than individual ARs of
northern(southern) hemisphere. We found that magnetic and current helicities parameters
show equator-ward propagation similar to the sunspot cycle. The kinetic helicity showed
similar hemispheric trend to that of magnetic and current helicity parameters. There are
65%(56%) ARs with negative (positive) kinetic helicity as well as divergence-curl, at the
depth of 2.4 Mm, in the northern (southern) hemisphere. The hemispheric distribution of
the kinetic helicity becomes more evident at larger depths, e.g., 69%(67%) at the depth of
12.6 Mm. Similar hemispheric trend of kinetic helicity to that of the current helicity supports
the mean ﬁeld dynamo model. We also found that the hemispheric distribution of all the
parameters increases with the ﬁeld strength of ARs. The topology of photospheric magnetic
ﬁelds and near surface sub-photospheric ﬂow ﬁelds did not show good association but the
correlation between them enhances with depths which could be indicating more aligned ﬂows
at deeper layers of ARs.

1. Introduction

Solar active regions are three-dimensional magnetic structures extending from the interior
below the photosphere to the coronal heights. They consist of magnetic ﬂux tubes that
emerge from the convection zone and extend into the solar atmosphere (Hood, Archontis,
and MacTaggart, 2011, and references therein). Solar interior near the photosphere is an
excellent conductor where frozen-in-ﬁeld condition may satisfy (Priest, 2014). Over a period
of time, near the photosphere, plasma ﬂows may evolve with magnetic ﬁeld lines, and may
swirl around them. A ﬂux tube emerging from the convection region is prevented from being

destroyed by the hydrodynamics vortex behind it when twisting eﬀects are present (Fan
et al., 1998). Therefore, we can expect topological association between the sub-photospheric
ﬂows and photospheric magnetic ﬁelds.

Mathematically, the topology of a vector ﬁeld X is represented by the parameter “helicity”.
It is deﬁned by the volume integral of the scalar product of the vector ﬁeld and its curl,
Y = ∇ × X,

H =

X · Y dV.

(1)

ZV

The helicity is a fundamental topological quantity in laboratory as well as in astrophysical
plasma. In general, helicity (Equation 1) describes what kind of handedness is preferable for
the ﬁeld X, left or right hand screw. If ∇ × X is clockwise when viewed from ahead of the
body, then helicity is positive; and if counter-clockwise, it is negative. The helicity deﬁned
in Equation 1 is a global parameter over the entire volume V .

The magnetic helicity of a divergence-free ﬁeld B within a volume V , bounded by a

surface S, is deﬁned by (Elsasser, 1956),

Hm =

A · B dV

(2)

Z

V
where, the vector potential A satisﬁes, B = ∇ × A. However, Equation 2 is gauge invariant
(independent of φ where A′ = A + ∇φ) when the magnetic ﬁeld is fully contained inside
the volume V . The helicity Hm is a measure of linking, knotting and twisting of ﬁeld lines
(Moﬀatt, 1969; Berger and Field, 1984). Note that there is a subtle mathematical diﬀerence
between the general deﬁnition of the helicity H (Equation 1) and the magnetic helicity Hm
(Equation 2). In the deﬁnition of the helicity H of the ﬁeld X, we integrate the scalar product
of the ﬁeld X with its curl, while for the helicity Hm of magnetic ﬁeld B, we integrate the
scalar product of vector potential A of magnetic ﬁeld B (and NOT B itself) with its curl.
This makes diﬃcult to compute the magnetic helicity, as the vector potential A is gauge
invariant and the full 3D magnetic ﬁelds are not observable. Therefore, force-free parameter
αf given in the equation,

∇ × B = αf B,

(3)

is taken as a proxy for the magnetic helicity by several researchers (Pevtsov et al., 2008, and
references therein). The topology of ﬂow ﬁelds can be given by the kinetic helicity (Moﬀatt
and Tsinober, 1992; Moﬀatt, 1969). It is deﬁned as the volume integral of the scalar product
of velocity (u) and vorticity ω ,

Hk =

u · ω dV

(4)

Z

V
where, vorticity, ω = ∇ × u, is another important topological parameter to describe the
ﬂow which represents circulation per unit area or twist of ﬂuid ﬁelds. It is a pseudo-vector (or
axial vector) that transforms like a vector under a proper rotation, but in three dimensions
again an additional sign ﬂip occurs under an improper rotation such as a reﬂection. Note
that Hk retains the same mathematical form for the ﬂow ﬁeld u as of H for the vector ﬁeld
X. It represents extent to which corkscrew-like motion occurs. If a parcel of ﬂuid is moving
and rotating about an axis parallel to the direction of motion, it will be positive. In the
absence of complete velocity ﬁeld observations, we compute the kinetic helicity density,

hk = u · ω = u · ∇ × u,

(5)

as a proxy for the swirls in the sub-photospheric ﬂows. The kinetic helicity density, hk, is a
scalar quantity and it represents the component of vorticity along the direction of ﬂow. In
magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic helicity of ﬂow ﬁeld has similar mathematical form as
that of the “current helicity”,

Z

where, J is current density which is related with magnetic ﬁeld by formula, J = 1
µ0 ∇ × B,
and µ0 = 4π × 10−7 Hm−1 is the permeability of free space. The current helicity quantiﬁes
the location of twist and sheared non-potential structures in a magnetic ﬁeld of ARs. It
deﬁnes the degree of twist and linkage of electric currents. Since full 3D magnetic ﬁelds are
not observed, we consider the current helicity density as follow,

hc = (∇ × B) · B.

(7)

It is evident from Equation 2 and 6 that only current helicity density can be estimated
from the vector magnetograms under the assumption of non-linear force-free ﬁeld, and
the calculation of magnetic helicity density can only be made under the more restrictive
assumption of constant αf of force-free ﬁeld. However, the force-free parameter αf has the
same sign as that of magnetic ﬁeld under the assumption of linear force ﬁeld (Hagyard and
Pevtsov, 1999). They are related by the formula, hc = αf B2
z (Seehafer, 1990), which implies
that for a given AR, the current helicity has same sign as that of the magnetic helicity.
However, in a recent study, Russell et al. (2019) conjectured that current and magnetic
helicities having the same sign is not true in general.

In the solar chromosphere, magnetic structures such as Hα vortices, ﬁlament chirality,
etc., manifest the existence of helicity in ARs. The topology in all the above features
demonstrate a consistent pattern relating a large scale ordering of solar magnetic ﬁelds.
From a study of chromospheric Hα images of 51 sunspots from 1901 to 1944, Hale (1927)
ﬁrst reported the preference of hemispheric trend in the Hα vortices. Later, Richardson
(1941) included some more sunspots and reported 71% (66%) with left-handed (right-
handed) vortices in the northern (southern) hemisphere. The hemispheric sign rule (HSR)
has also been found in the chirality of chromospheric ﬁlaments (e.g., Martin, Bilimoria, and
Tracadas, 1994; Pevtsov, Balasubramaniam, and Rogers, 2003; Lim and Chae, 2009).

Vector magnetic ﬁeld observations of solar ARs have revealed that on average solar ARs
have a small but statistically signiﬁcant mean twist and they show hemispheric biases. The
magnetic helicity (Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Metcalf, 1995; Longcope, Fisher, and Pevtsov,
1998; Bao, Ai, and Zhang, 2000; LaBonte, Georgoulis, and Rust, 2007; Yang, Zhang, and
Büchner, 2009; Zhang and Yang, 2013; Liu, Hoeksema, and Sun, 2014) and the current
helicity (Seehafer, 1990; Bao and Zhang, 1998; Abramenko, Wang, and Yurchishin, 1996;
Pevtsov, Canﬁeld, and Latushko, 2001; Hagino and Sakurai, 2005; Gosain et al., 2013, among
others) of ARs have been found to follow HSR. However, opposite HSR in the global force
free parameter αf has been reported earlier during the beginning (Bao, Ai, and Zhang,
2000) and decay phases (Tiwari, Venkatakrishnan, and Sankarasubramanian, 2009; Pipin
et al., 2019) of solar cycles. From an analysis of several ARs, Zhang (2006) pointed out that
the ARs with strong magnetic ﬁelds show opposite hemispheric trend. Pevtsov et al. (2008)
compared data from four diﬀerent instruments and concluded that HSR sign change in some
phases of the solar cycle is not supported at high level of signiﬁcance. Choudhuri, Chatterjee,
and Nandy (2004) have numerically shown the hemispheric preference of magnetic helicity
parameter αf . They also noticed opposite HSR at the beginning of solar cycle. However,
there is also some debate about this rule.

Twist in a magnetic ﬂux tube can be formed due to: (1) Coriolis force acting on rising ﬂux
tube (Holder et al., 2004) and Σ-eﬀect (Longcope, Fisher, and Pevtsov, 1998). The Coriolis
force tilts one leg of the tube towards equator and the other away. This deformation generates
helical distortion in the tube’s central axis. (2) Flux tube buﬀeted by the turbulence of
convection outside the tube during its rise through the convection zone. The kinetic helicity
of the turbulent ﬂows in convection zone twists the rising ﬂux tube. (3) Background poloidal
ﬁeld (Choudhuri, 2003; Choudhuri, Chatterjee, and Nandy, 2004). The magnetic helicity
is expected to change its sign too because ﬂows drags ﬁeld lines with it (Gilman, 1983).
Longcope, Fisher, and Pevtsov (1998) showed ﬂuid motion with right handed coil deform
the ﬂux tube with a left handed.

Maurya and Ambastha

Using helioseismic measurement of sub-photospheric ﬂows, Komm et al. (2007) have
reported cyclonic vorticity (counter clockwise) in the northern hemisphere. The hemisphere
preference has also been found in other studies (Gao, Zhang, and Zhao, 2009; Maurya,
Ambastha, and Reddy, 2011; Seligman, Petrie, and Komm, 2014; Komm, Gosain, and
Pevtsov, 2014). There are a few studies on the combined topology of sub-photospheric ﬂows
and photospheric magnetic helicities (Gao, Zhang, and Zhao, 2009; Maurya, Ambastha, and
Reddy, 2011; Seligman, Petrie, and Komm, 2014; Komm and Gosain, 2015). In some of
these studies, kinetic helicity has been found to show statistically opposite HSR than that
of current helicities (Gao, Zhang, and Zhao, 2009).

There are not enough studies reported on the topology of the combined photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds and sub-photospheric velocity ﬁelds from the peak to descending phase of
the solar cycle 23. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the topological parameters
of sub-photospheric ﬂows, photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and their hemispheric preferences,
associations. With this aim, we explore for any possible relationship between the magnetic
and kinetic helicities using photospheric vector magnetograms and Dopplergrams observa-
tions of a large sample of ARs. Rest of the manuscript is organized as follow: In Section 2, we
describe the selection of ARs and the observational data used. We discuss the methodology
for computing diﬀerent helicity parameters. Section 3 is devoted to the results and discussion,
and ﬁnally, we present the summary and conclusions in Section 4.

2. The Active Regions, Data and Analysis

The main observational data used in this study consists of dopplergrams and vector magneto-
grams of several ARs of the main to decay phase of the solar cycle 23. Doppler observations of
the full disc Sun for several years are available from the Global Oscillation Network Group
(GONG) while the corresponding vector magnetic ﬁeld observations are not available as
such during the aforementioned period. Therefore, for our studies, we have obtained vector
magnetograms from the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Furthermore, GONG high
resolution Doppler observations are available from 22 July 2001 onward while MSFC vector
magnetograms are available only for the periods 19 September 2000 to 25 October 2004.
Due to this constraint, we have chosen only the common sets of data for the period of 22
July 2001 to 25 October 2004. The other limitations are the availability of daily vector
magnetic ﬁeld data. There are data gaps of several days. ARs far away from the disc center
suﬀer from the foreshortening eﬀects (Maurya, Ambastha, and Chae., 2014, and references
therein) and produce spurious results in helioseismic computations. Hence, we selected only
the ARs within the radius of ±40o in heliographic longitude and latitude. In total, we short-
listed 189 ARs for the common period of MSFC and GONG observations, where some of
these ARs were observed during multiple rotations. In our sample of 189 ARs, 118 ARs were
found to be located in the southern hemisphere and 71 ARs in the northern hemisphere.
Thus the number of ARs for the southern hemisphere is larger than that in the northern
hemisphere. However, we do not expect our results on HSR to be statistically aﬀected by
the diﬀerent numbers of ARs in the two hemispheres.

2.1. The Vector Magnetograms and Analysis

The MSFC vector magnetograph facility was assembled in 1973 to support the Skylab
mission, and thereafter went through several improvements (MSFC, Hagyard et al., 1982;
Hagyard and Kineke, 1995; West et al., 2002). The vector magnetic ﬁelds data were taken in
the magnetically sensitivity spectral line Fe i 5250.2 Å using the Zeiss birefringent ﬁlter with
band pass of 125 mÅ. Its spatial resolution over the 7′ × 5.2′ ﬁeld-of-view is 0.64′′pixel−1.
These observations are taken in the far wing of the spectral line at -90 mÅ(or -120 mÅ) from
the line center, where the Faraday rotation eﬀect decreases (Ronan et al., 1992). The pixel
resolution of the MSFC magnetograms is 1′′.28 along both x- and y-directions.

The MSFC observations consist of line-of sight magnetic ﬁeld (Bl), transverse component
(Bt) and the azimuth angle (φ) of Bt. The horizontal components (Bx, By) of the vector
magnetic ﬁeld can be computed from Bt and φ. We resolved the usual 180◦ ambiguity in
the transverse components from all the vector magnetograms using the acute angle method

Topology of Solar Active Regions

although there are several other methods available as reviewed by Metcalf et al. (2006).
Further, to avoid any projection eﬀects, we transformed the images to the disc center using
the method described by Venkatakrishnan and Gary (1989).

The MSFC vector magnetograms are not aligned in the east-west and north-south dir-
ections which should be corrected for comparing the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds with
sub-photospheric ﬂows obtained from the GONG. Active region’s NOAA number and their
central locations are provided in the header of every vector magnetogram. However the
central coordinates are found to be incorrect in some cases. In order to correct the coordinates
and orientation of the MSFC vector magnetograms, we have used the full disc SOHO/MDI
magnetograms for reference. First of all, based on the location and time provided in the
header of the vectors magnetograms, we estimated corresponding location in the MDI mag-
netograms and then after cross-correlating the ARs between MSFC and MDI magnetograms,
we corrected for the locations and orientations of MSFC observations.

2.1.1. Determination of Magnetic and Current Helicities

As discussed in the Section 1, the force-free parameter αf (Equation 3) can be used as a
proxy for the magnetic helicity (Equation 2). But, B is observed only at a single height, so
we can have its derivatives only along x− and y− directions. Thus, we can compute only the
vertical part of αf . Basically, there are two approaches for calculating it: i) (αf )z
best which
is the best ﬁt single value for the whole AR in the least squares sense (Pevtsov, Canﬁeld,
and Metcalf, 1995), and ii) (αf )z
av which is the average of the vertical component of αf
over the entire AR (Bao and Zhang, 1998; Abramenko, Wang, and Yurchishin, 1996; Hagino
and Sakurai, 2004). Both methods have been found to be in fairly good agreement to each
other (Leka and Skumanich, 1999). For a linear force-free ﬁeld, the values of αf for a given
position (x, y), can be given by,

αz

where, numerical derivatives of magnetic ﬁeld components can be determined using the
Lagrange’s three point interpolation. While computing the pixel values of αz
f (x, y) in an
AR, we selected only those pixels where the total magnetic ﬁeld strength were above the
quiet regions. To get the net twist in an AR, we took average over the entire AR,

We have also computed the net absolute magnetic ﬂux (B) for every AR by adding the ﬂuxes
for those positions where helicity is estimated. From the above expressions for the magnetic
helicity parameter αz
av (Equation 9) and current helicity parameter hz
c (Equation 10), it is
evident that both these parameters could have same sign for a given AR.

2.2. Sub-photospheric Flows

The horizontal components (ux, uy) of the sub-photospheric ﬂow parameters for all ARs
are computed from the Doppler observations using the ring-diagram analysis (Hill, 1988).
The basis of this method is that the frequency of sound waves inside the solar interior are
perturbed by the sub-photospheric plasma motion, δωn,ℓ = kn,ℓ · Un,ℓ, where, kn,ℓ is the
propagation vector and Un,ℓ is the ﬂow vector for a given mode (n, ℓ). Mode parameter
Un,ℓ can be computed by ﬁtting the three dimensional Doppler power spectra (Haber et al.,

SOLA: ms_kmhel.tex; 25 June 2020; 0:42; p. 5

Maurya and Ambastha

2000). It is related with the sub-photospheric ﬂows, Un,ℓ =
Kn,ℓ(r)u(r)dr + ǫn,ℓ, where
the kernel Kn,ℓ can be computed based on standard solar model (Christensen-Dalsgaard
et al., 1996), u(r) is the horizontal velocity at radius r, and ǫn,ℓ is the error in the mode
parameter Un,ℓ. This is an inverse problem, Fredholm equation of ﬁrst kind, which can be
solved using inversion methods such as regularized least squares (Gough, 1985). For more
detail about the ring-diagram analysis one can refer to the review paper by Antia and Basu
(2007).

R

The sub-photospheric ﬂows are largely aﬀected by the solar diﬀerential rotation and
meridional circulations. We computed the residual ﬂows by removing these large scale trend
following the methods as described in Komm et al. (2004).

Ring-diagram yields only the horizontal components, ux and uy, of the ﬂow, but not the
vertical component, uz, at any point in the interior. We estimated the uz from the divergence
of horizontal components, assuming mass conservation (Komm et al., 2004), or steady-state
continuity equation,

with horizontal divergence,

∂ρ(z)uz
∂z

+ ρ(z)(∇ · u)h = 0,

divh ≡ (∇ · u)h ≡

∂ux
∂x

+

∂uy
∂y

.

(11)

(12)

Note that z is the vertical height increasing with radial distance with the origin on the
surface. The interior is speciﬁed by a negative value of z. By supposing uz on the surface,
z = 0, and integrating the continuity Equation 11 over z from d (negative) to 0, we obtain,

uz(d) = −

ρ(z)(∇ · u)hdz

d

1
ρ(d)

(13)

Z
which has the same form as Equation (5) of Komm et al. (2004). Now, suppose (∇ · u)h > 0
in the height range from d to 0, then it follows that uz(d) > 0. This means that a horizontally
diverging ﬂow rises upward, and hence uz and (∇ · u)h are expected to have the same sign.

2.2.1. Sub-photospheric Topological Parameters

Following, Equation 10 for the current helicity, we computed the vertical kinetic helicity
density as follow,

where, the vertical vorticity is given by,

hz
k = huz · ωzi

ωz ≡ curlz =

∂uy
∂x

−

∂ux
∂y

,

(14)

(15)

Note that the vertical kinetic helicity density hz

represents the twist of the ﬂow around the vertical (radial direction). The parameter hz
k is
analogous to hc (Equation 7), and we have taken it as a proxy for the kinetic helicity density.
k (Equation 14) is obtained from the
weighted average of ωz by uz. But one should note that in strong magnetic ﬁeld regions ver-
tical ﬂows are suppressed due to the Lorentz force. The horizontal divergence (Equation 12)
of ﬂows from the sunspot regions to outwards are common. Therefore, weighted average of
ωz with divh would be a better estimate for the vertical helicity. Such a parameter can be
given by,

Cz

k = hdivh · curlzi

(16)

The parameter, Cz

k because divh and uz are
expected to have same sign as explained earlier. This expression for the vertical twist has been

used earlier for studying the kinetic helicity of supergrannular ﬂows (Egorov, Rüdiger, and
Ziegler, 2004) and sub-photospheric ﬂows (Komm et al., 2007). The validity of above helicity
proxy has been conﬁrmed for the depth range obtained from ring-diagram as numerically
established by Miesch et al. (2008).

In order to compute the sub-photospheric ﬂow topological parameters for an AR, we
ﬁrst computed them over patches of 60◦ × 60◦ around the disc center. Then the parameters
associated with the ARs were interpolated based on their coordinates on the solar disc.

Earlier studies (Komm et al., 2005; Maurya, Ambastha, and Tripathy, 2009; Maurya
and Ambastha, 2010) have shown bipolar structure of sub-photospheric ﬂows in several
ARs. Therefore, two diﬀerent types of twists are possible in the underlying ﬂows of ARs.
To deal with it, we analysed hz
k at the two depths of 2.4 Mm and 12.6 Mm. For
distribution, the associated parameters are labeled by the subscripts ‘1’ and ‘2’, e.g., hz
k1
and hz

k and Cz

k2, respectively.

The sub-photospheric ﬂows of ARs are obtained from the 1664 minute time-series dur-
ation with a cadence of one-minute Doppler observations and thus correspond to average
subsurface ﬂows over a day. Therefore, for comparing magnetic ﬁeld topology with sub-
photospheric ﬂows of an AR, the magnetic ﬁeld topological parameters are also averaged
accordingly.

Note that, next section onward, we have used the vertically averaged quantities only, and
therefore, we have dropped the scripts “z” and “av” from all the topological parameters, e.g.,
we have used hc instead of (hc)z

av.

3. Results and Discussion

Results of our analysis of the 189 ARs are shown in Figures 1 – 11. The hemispheric
distribution of topological parameters are summarized in the Tables 1 and 2.

3.1. Photospheric Magnetic Fields

The photospheric magnetic ﬁeld topology is studied in terms of magnetic helicity parameter
αf (Section 3.1.1) and current helicity hc (Section 3.1.2). In the following, we discuss the
results obtained.

3.1.1. Magnetic Helicity

The results of our analysis for the magnetic helicity parameter αf are shown in Figures 1
– 3. Figure 1(a) shows the latitudinal distribution of magnetic helicity parameter αf for the
189 ARs. We found 68%(67%) ARs in the northern (southern) hemisphere with negative
(positive) αf . This result further conﬁrms the earlier reports on HSR for the magnetic
helicity. We notice that αf shows large scatter in both the hemispheres. Therefore, the
following questions arise: Is the hemispheric sign statistically signiﬁcant? How do αf values
vary with latitude?

To address the above questions, we ﬁtted a linear regression model through the paramet-
ers αf . In Figure 1(a), the solid line shows the linear regression line while dashed curves
correspond to the 95% conﬁdence (∼ 2σ) interval. The conﬁdence interval 95% contains the
best-ﬁt regression line. The ﬁtted line has a slope, −3.4 × 10−10m−1degree−1, such that the
magnitude of αf increases with latitude. However, linear regression is not fully satisfactory
because we do not have any known reason for the straight line to be the appropriate ﬁt. But
at the same time, we can not justify higher order polynomials. The average values of αf in
northern (southern) hemisphere is found to be −4.7(+7.6) × 10−9m−1.

To examine the statistical signiﬁcance of hemispheric trend, we calculated probability
distribution function (PDF) for αf which is shown in Figure 1(b). The peak of density
function for northern (southern) hemisphere lies at −5.4(+3.4) × 10−8m−1. These results
conﬁrm the hemispheric trend of the estimated αf values for our set of ARs. The FWHM of
PDF of αf for northern (southern) hemispheric points is 2.3(2.6) × 10−8m−1. That is, αf of
the southern hemisphere is spread slightly more than that of the northern hemisphere.

Figure 1. (a) Latitudinal distribution of the force-free parameter αf , where solid lines represent the linear
least square ﬁtting between the parameter αf and latitude, while the dashed curves correspond to 95%
conﬁdence intervals. (b) Probability distribution function of the parameter αf for the northern hemisphere
(solid & red) and southern hemisphere (dotted & blue). Bottom row is similar to the top row but for the
current helicity hc.

Next we address whether ARs of diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths have similar twist
in their ﬁeld lines. For this, we plotted the magnetic ﬁeld parameter αf as a function of
absolute magnetic ﬂux (B) in Figure 2(a). In this plot, we have only shown the data points
with |αf | ≥ 0.5 × 10−8m−1 for clarity. A linear regression is performed through positive
and negative values of αf of ARs. The values of slope of the regression is found to be
+5.6(−5.8) × 10−11m−1G−1 for positive (negative) αf . This result shows that the ARs with
stronger magnetic ﬁelds have larger twist irrespective of ARs’s hemispheric locations.

Figure 2(b) shows magnetic ﬁeld related HSR in the helicity parameter αf . For this, we
ran a boxcar magnetic ﬂux of size 50 G, and counted ARs following the HSR as a function of
B. Linear regressions through the data are shown with dashed lines with a slope 0.06(0.10).
This implies that the HSR becomes stronger with magnetic ﬁelds strength of ARs.

Next, we explore the time dependent hemispheric trend of the magnetic helicity parameter
αf (Figure 3). Figure 3(a) shows the monthly averaged sunspot number as a function of time;
in the period where ARs are taken for this paper. A complete solar cycle 23 is also shown
in the inset of the top panel where vertically dotted lines mark the time window over which
ARs are taken for this analysis. This period corresponds to the peak to the descending phase
of the solar cycle 23.

Magnetic helicity parameter αf for the northern and southern hemisphere is plotted in
Figure 3(b). The symbols with opened(ﬁlled) circles represent negative(positive) values of the
magnetic helicity parameter αf . This panel not only shows the predominantly hemispheric
distribution of the parameter αf but also part of the butterﬂy-diagrams for sunspots which
indicates that the sunspots appear at larger latitude in the beginning of solar cycle and as
time passes they appear at lower latitude as shown by the linear regression lines (dashed)
through ARs latitudes.

Figure 2. (a) The helicity parameter αf as a function of absolute magnetic ﬂux of ARs. Solid (dashed) line
below (above) αf = 0 represents the linear least square ﬁtting through northern (southern) data points. The
slopes of the ﬁtted lines are mentioned within the rectangular boxes. (b) Hemispheric distribution of ARs
based on αf values as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. The dashed (solid) lines represent the linear regression
for the northern (southern) ARs. Corresponding equations are given in the rectangular boxes. Bottom row
is similar to the top row but for the current helicity hc.

These distributions show a clear indication of the hemispheric distribution of the magnetic
helicity in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Around the end of year 2002, there
are ARs with slightly large magnetic helicity. During the end phase of the solar cycle, the
magnetic helicity reduces, as is obvious from the smaller circles. Overall, there seems to be
equator-ward propagation of the magnetic helicity parameter αf similar to the sunspots of
the solar cycle. Such results have also been reported in another study by Zhang et al. (2010)
in their data obtained from other sources.

In order to get the time dependent hemisphere distribution of the parameter αf , we
ran a boxcar of width 90 days and counted the numbers of ARs following the HSR in
both the hemispheres. Figure 3(d) shows the boxcar averaged hemispheric distribution of
the parameter αf . This plot shows that the ARs on average follow HSR for the magnetic
helicity parameter αf except at peak and end phase of the cycle for northern and southern
ARs, respectively. The opposite hemispheric trend during the decay phase of this solar cycle
has been found in earlier studies (e.g., Bao, Ai, and Zhang, 2000; Tiwari, Venkatakrishnan,
and Sankarasubramanian, 2009; Pipin et al., 2019).

3.1.2. Current Helicity

Next, we analysed the current helicities hc of all the 189 ARs similar to the magnetic helicity
parameter αf (see Section 3.1.1). The results of our analysis are shown in Figures 1 – 3.
Figure 1(c) shows the latitudinal distribution of the vertical current helicity hc. There are
68% ARs in both northern and southern hemispheres with negative and positive current
helicities hc, respectively. The small deviation in hc from αf for the southern ARs is due to
averaging of hc values for ARs that are observed multiple times. The values of hc show a
similar hemispheric trend as the force-free parameter αf (Figure 1a). The slope of linear least
square ﬁt through hc of ARs is found to be −2.0 × 10−10Gm−1degree−1. This hemispheric
trend of ARs based on hc conﬁrms the earlier reports (Abramenko, Wang, and Yurchishin,
1996, and others).

The probability distribution function for hc is shown in Figure 1(d). This shows hemi-
spheric trend for hc as the PDFs for northern and southern hemispheric ARs peak at
−4.1 × 10−4G2m−1 and +1.8 × 10−4G2m−1, respectively. The FWHM of PDF for northern
hemisphere is 1.3 × 10−3G2 m−1 and for the southern hemisphere 1.5 × 10−3G2 m−1. The
PDF proﬁles of the parameter hc and the parameter αf are look-alike representing similar
distributions of two topological parameters in ARs.

Figure 2(c) shows the variation of current helicity hc as a function of absolute magnetic
ﬂux (B). It is found that hc increases on increasing the magnetic ﬂux of ARs similar to
the magnetic helicity parameter αf (Figure 2a). The slope of the linear least square ﬁtting
is found to be 5.1(−5.8) × 10−6Gm−1 for the positive (negative) hc values of ARs. This

SOLA: ms_kmhel.tex; 25 June 2020; 0:42; p. 11

Maurya and Ambastha

suggests that the ARs with stronger magnetic ﬁelds may have more current helicity than
typical ARs. Figure 2(d) shows the hemispheric distribution of the current helicity hc as a
function of B, similar to Figure 2(b) for the helicity parameter αf . It shows that the HSR
becomes stronger with the magnetic ﬁeld strength B as the slopes for northern(southern)
ARs is found to be 0.06(0.10).

We have also analyzed the solar cyclic variation in the current helicity hc. Figure 3(c)
shows the hemispheric distribution of the current helicity parameter hc as a function of time.
This plot further conﬁrms the equator-ward propagation of helicity hc patterns. Since hc
has same sign as αf , it shows similar time dependent distribution as shown in Figure 3(d)
for the parameter αf .

Ck (last two columns) at two diﬀerent depths 2.4 Mm (top row) and 12.6 Mm (bottom row).

3.2. Sub-photospheric Flow Fields

Helicities in the sub-photospheric velocity ﬁelds in our sample of 189 ARs are studied
by computing the kinetic helicity density hk (Equation 14) and the divergence-curl Ck
(Equation 16). In Figures 4 – 9, we explain our results based on these parameters.

3.2.1. Kinetic Helicity Density

Figure 4(a-d) shows the latitudinal distribution of the vertical kinetic helicity hk for depths
2.4 Mm (a) and 12.6 Mm (c). There is a clear hemispheric preference in the parameter hk as
there are 65%(56%) ARs at depth of 2.4 Mm and 69%(67%) ARs at depth of 12.6 Mm in
the northern (southern) hemisphere having negative(positive) values. The linear regression
through ARs shows slopes of −1.8 × 10−10s−2degree−1 for the depth of 2.4 Mm and −1.2 ×
10−9s−2degree−1 for the depths of 12.6 Mm. These results show that the kinetic helicity have
same hemispheric preference as that of magnetic helicity αf and current helicity hc. The
larger values of hk for deeper layers indicate that the parameter hk have better hemispheric
preference at larger depths.

To further conﬁrm the hemispheric preference of kinetic helicity hk, we have computed
the PDF for the parameter hk of northern and southern ARs. Figures 4(b) and 4(d) shows
the PDF of hk for the depths 2.4 Mm and 12.6 Mm. The PDF for hk peaked at −0.2(+0.1) ×
10−9ms−2 for northern (southern) hemispheric ARs for the depth 2.4 Mm. Similarly, the
PDF for hk at the depth 12.6 Mm peaked at −0.7(+1.1) × 10−9ms−2 which further conﬁrms
the HSR for parameter hk.

In order to check depth dependent HSR for hk, we computed the PDFs for all the available
depths and plotted in Figure 5(a). We have also estimated the hk associated with peaks of
PDFs and displayed in Figure 5(b). We ﬁnd that the peak position shifted towards larger hk
values at larger depths for both hemispheric ARs. The southern ARs show larger hk values
than northern ARs at deeper layers (> 6 Mm) but at shallower depths (< 6 Mm) northern

ARs have larger hk values than southern ARs. This could be due to stronger swirls in the
sub-photospheric ﬂows at deeper layers than shallower.

We have also analysed the variations in the kinetic helicity as a function of magnetic
ﬂux B. For this, we computed the slope of the distribution of hk vs B as a function of
depth (Figure 6a). We found that the magnitude of the slope enhances considerably at
larger depths > 3 M m for both positive and negative helicities. For example, the slope for

Figure 7. (Top row) Hemispheric distribution of sub-photospheric ﬂow parameters hk for northern (a) and
southern (b) hemisphere, as a function of depth and magnetic ﬂux B. (Bottom row) Similar to the top row
but for the parameter Ck.

the depth 2.4 Mm is found to be +1.9(+1.1) × 10−10ms−2 for positive(negative) hk values
while it increased to +1.4(−1.3) × 10−9ms−2G−1 at the depth of 12.6 Mm. The positive
(negative) values of slope for the parameter hk > 0(hk < 0) represent the linear relation
between the helicity parameter hk and B. Similar result has been found for the magnetic
helicity (Figure 2b) and the current helicity (Figure 2d).

Next, we ﬁnd the hemispheric distribution of the parameter hk as a function of depth
and magnetic ﬂux. For this we counted the number of ARs following the HSR by running a
magnetic ﬂux window of width 50 G for all depths. These results are shown in Figure 7(top
row) for northern (left panel) and southern (right panel) hemispheres. This clearly shows
that the HSR, statistically, becomes stronger at larger depths. Also, as the magnetic ﬂux
B increases the hemispheric biases of ARs shifted towards larger depths. However, in ARs
with smaller ﬂuxes show opposite HSR trend in both hemispheres. Similar preference is also
discernible at shallower layers in ARs having stronger ﬂuxes. The increase in hemispheric
preference of with magnetic ﬂux has also been found for the photospheric magnetic helicity
αf (Figure 2b) as well as for the current helicity hc (Figure 2d).

Figure 8(b) and 9(b) show the time dependent variations in the kinetic helicity parameter
hk for the depths 2.4 Mm and 12.6 Mm, respectively. The hemispheric biases are noticeable
during the peak to decay phase of the solar cycle. But, these preferences are slightly weaker
than the magnetic and current helicity parameters. The kinetic helicity hk is found to be
scattered signiﬁcantly for both depths throughout the time period considered in the analysis.
The magnitude of kinetic helicity of all ARs for the depth of 12.6 Mm are found to be larger
throughout than that for the depth of 2.4 Mm. This shows largely variant sub-photospheric
twisted ﬂows in the interior of ARs. We could not ﬁnd clear signature of equator-ward
propagation of ARs for the parameter hk at both depths.

In the ﬁrst half year of 2003, the ARs in northern hemisphere deviated largely from
usual HSR for the depth of 2.4 Mm (Figure 8d). Similarly, southern ARs show opposite HSR
during November 2002 to January 2003. For the depth of 12.6 Mm (Figure 8d), the ARs
show better HSR even during the aforesaid period. Southern ARs show better HSR than
northern ARs from the peak to decay phase of the solar cycle. But, at the end phase of
the solar cycle, some ARs in southern hemisphere were found to have opposite hemispheric
trend.

3.2.2. Divergence-Curls of Sub-photospheric Flows

Figure 4(e-h) shows the latitudinal distribution of sub-photospheric ﬂow parameter Ck for
depths 2.4 Mm (e) and 12.6 Mm (g). For the above two depths, the latitudinal distributions
of ARs are found to be 65%(55%) and 65%(70%) in the northern (southern) hemispheres
having negative (positive) values of Ck. We noticed that the hemispheric distribution of
ARs for Ck and hk are same for the depth 2.4 Mm but diﬀerent for the depth of 12.6 Mm.
This is due to averaging of topological parameters of same ARs observed multiple times.
The linear regression through distribution of the parameter Ck shows a slope of −2.4 ×
10−17s−2degree−1 for the depth of 2.4 Mm and −2.5 × 10−17s−2degree−1 for the depth
of 12.6 Mm. These results show hemispheric preferences similar to the magnetic helicity
parameter αf (Figure 1a), current helicity hc(Figure 1c) and the kinetic helicity parameter
hk (Figure 4a and c).

The probability density function for the sub-photospheric ﬂow parameters Ck is shown
in Figures 4(f) for the shallower depth at 2.4 Mm and 4(h) for the deeper layer at 12.6 Mm.
For the depth 2.4 Mm the parameter Ck peaks at −2.5(+0.0 × 10−16) s−2 and for the depth
12.6 Mm it peaks at −2.0(+3.6 × 10−16) s−2 for the northern (southern) hemisphere while
average values of Ck were found to be −4.2(+0.22) × 10−16s−2 for the depth of 2.4 Mm and
−0.43(+0.34) × 10−15s−2 for the depth of 12.6 Mm. This further conﬁrms the HSR in Ck
for the sub-photospheric ﬂows of ARs.

Figure 5(c) shows depth dependent PDF for the parameter Ck for northern (red) and
southern (blue) hemispheres similar to Figure 5 (a) for the kinetic helicity hk. Figure 5(d)
represents the variations in peak position of PDF for northern (red) and southern(blue)
hemispheres as function of depth. The hemispheric distribution for the parameter Ck is found
to exist for all depth range 0 – 20 Mm. At depths beyond 2.0 Mm it is signiﬁcant as evident
from Figure 5(d). The peaks of PDFs, between depth range 5 – 20 Mm, for both hemispheres
are found to be nearly constant at −2.0(+3.5)×10−16s−2 for northern (southern) hemisphere
while it shifted towards larger values at larger depth for the parameter hk. The constant
distribution of maximum peak of PDF of Ck is due to horizontal divergence. The ﬂows are
found to be largely diverging near the photosphere than in deeper layers. Hence increase in
vorticity is compensated by decrease in divergence and results into constant value for the
parameter Ck.

In order to study the variation in the topological parameter Ck as a function of depth
and magnetic ﬁelds, we computed the slope of the distribution, Ck vs. B. The results are
shown in the Figure 6(b) for Ck > 0(solid and red curves) and Ck < 0(dotted and blue
curves). For example, the slope for Ck > 0 (Ck < 0) for the depth of 2.4 Mm is found to
be +0.78(−3.04) × 10−18s−2G−1 while it changed to +1.61(−2.63) × 10−18s−2G−1 for the
depth of 12.6 Mm. The slopes, on average, are found to increase as we go deeper (> 4 M m).
Similar to the helicity hk (Figure 7, top row), we computed the depth and magnetic
ﬁeld dependent hemispheric preference of the parameter Ck. This result is shown in Fig-
ure 7(bottom row). It clearly shows that the hemispheric distribution of Ck shifted towards

larger depths as the magnetic ﬁeld increases. Also, it can be noticed that the HSR became
stronger with depth and magnetic ﬂux B. Near the photosphere with stronger ﬂux regions
and deeper layers with smaller ﬂuxes, the opposite hemispheric trends have been found in
both the hemisphere. The hemispheric preference for the parameter Ck is very similar to
that of hk (Figure 7, top row) with same sign of handedness.

In order to check the solar cyclic variation of the parameter divergence-curl (Ck), we have
plotted it as a function of time for two depths 2.4 Mm (Figure 8c) and 12.6 Mm (Figure 8c).
We found that most of ARs shows Ck around an absolute mean of 1.0 × 10−15s−1 for both
the depths. We found that the parameter Ck ranges between ±4 × 10−15s−2 for both the
depths (Figure 8c and 8c) while hk (Figure 8b and 8b) have larger ranges for deeper depths.
Similar to the parameter hk, we did not ﬁnd clear evidence of equator-ward propagation of
the parameter Ck.

3.3. Relation between Kinetic and Magnetic Helicities

The relation between the surface and sub-surface helicities are shown in Figures 10 – 11.
Figure 10(top row) shows the correlation between the force-free parameter αf and the sub-
photospheric twist parameters for the parameters hk (a and c) and Ck (b and d) for two
depths 2.4 Mm (a and b) and 12.6 Mm (c and d). The parameter αf shows correlations
with Ck and hk at both depths. The correlation coeﬃcient is signiﬁcantly larger for deeper
layer than the shallower. The signiﬁcant values of the correlation coeﬃcient CC shows
relation between the two topological parameters of the surface magnetic ﬁelds and the sub-
photospheric ﬂows.

Figure 10. (top row) Kinetic helicity parameters hk and Ck for two depths 2.4 Mm (a and b) and 12.6 Mm
(c and d), as a function of magnetic helicity parameter αf , where the values of CC represent the Pearson
correlation coeﬃcients between the topology of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and sub-photospheric ﬂows.
Bottom row is similar to the top row but as a function of current helicity hc.

Figure 10(bottom row) shows correlation between the current helicity and the twist
parameter of sub-photospheric ﬂows similar to Figure 10(top row) for the parameter αf
and sub-photospheric ﬂow parameters hk and Ck. Corresponding correlation coeﬃcients are
given in respective panels. The magnitudes of correlations imply association between the
current helicity and the twist of sub-photospheric ﬂows of ARs.

In order to check the depth dependent association between topology of photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds and sub-photospheric ﬂows, we have computed the correlation coeﬃcients
between magnetic and ﬂows helicities parameters as a function of depth. The result is shown
in Figure 11.

An interesting pattern of CC with depth is that it is not random. It changes gradually
with depths. Very near the photosphere the sub-photospheric ﬂows and magnetic ﬁelds
topology show no signiﬁcant relation as the CC is close to zero. But the absolute CC
gradually increases with depth up to around of 1.5 Mm, then decreases and becomes min-
imum around a depth of 3.3 Mm, and thereafter starts increasing. There is a sharp increase

in CC between 3.4 – 12 Mm and after that it becomes almost constant. This shows that
the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld lines and the sub-photospheric ﬂows at larger depths have
similar topological trend. The two peaks in the CC-proﬁle indicates the bi-polar structure
in the sub-photospheric ﬂows as reported earlier (Komm et al., 2005; Maurya, Ambastha,
and Tripathy, 2009; Maurya and Ambastha, 2010).

Another, interesting pattern of CC is that at larger depths (> 5 Mm) the magnitude of
CC between current helicity and sub-photospheric topology is larger than the magnitude of
CC between force-free parameter αf and sub-photospheric topology parameters. This shows
that the current helicity has association with the sub-photospheric ﬂows topology. This is
also evident from the mean ﬁeld dynamo (Biskamp, 2003).

The gradual variation of CC between surface and sub-surface helicities could be due to
the relation between the magnetic ﬁeld and sub-photospheric ﬂows. But, one should note
that we are comparing the topology of magnetic ﬁeld at the photosphere and the ﬂows at
depths. Since, there is no direct measurement of magnetic ﬁeld in sub-photospheric depths,
we cannot conﬁdently suggest their association with ﬂows. But from the above results it
suggests that they may have some relation.

4. Summary and Conclusions

Using MSFC vector magnetograms and GONG Dopplergrams observations, we have ana-
lyzed the topological properties of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and sub-photospheric ﬂow
ﬁelds of 189 ARs that cover peak to descending phase of the solar cycle 23. Our analysis
conﬁrms previous reports, and show some new interesting results.

We found clear evidence of hemispheric preferences for the magnetic and current helicities.
The ARs of the northern(southern) hemisphere are found with dominantly negative (pos-
itive) helicities which conﬁrms earlier reports (Pevtsov et al., 2008, and others). However,
many ARs were found to show opposite hemispheric preferences, especially at beginning
and end phase of the solar cycle as indicated in others studies (Bao, Ai, and Zhang, 2000;
Tiwari, Venkatakrishnan, and Sankarasubramanian, 2009; Pipin et al., 2019). One should
note that in complex magnetic ﬁeld regions magnetic helicity proxy αf may deviate from
the force-free ﬁeld, i.e., αf may not be a true proxy for helicity in complex sunspot regions
to correctly reﬂect the twistedness of an AR as conjectured by Russell et al. (2019).

We have also found signature of equator-ward propagating pattern in the magnetic and
current helicities similar to sunspots, in both hemispheres, during descending phase of the
solar cycle. Zhang et al. (2010) have also reported similar results and suggested that the

SOLA: ms_kmhel.tex; 25 June 2020; 0:42; p. 19

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maurya and Ambastha

solar dynamo could be helical in nature. An AR with larger area and stronger ﬁelds may
have larger helicities. Therefore such patterns of helicities could also be due to variations of
areas and magnetic ﬁelds of sunspots during a solar cycle, from larger areas with stronger
ﬁelds regions to smaller areas with weaker ﬁeld regions (Watson, Fletcher, and Marshall,
2011).

On comparing the magnetic and current helicity parameters with ﬁeld strength of ARs,
we found that the magnitude of both helicities increases. Another interesting pattern was
found that the hemispheric preferences become stronger for both the helicity types, implying
that ARs with larger ﬁeld strengths show better hemispheric preferences. Hemispheric trend
of current helicity infers that the regular vortex structure of sunspots is caused by forces
such as the Coriolis and diﬀerential rotations.

In the sub-photospheric ﬂows, we found similar hemispheric trend for the topological
parameter, kinetic helicity hk and divergence-curl Ck at all depths. Both the ﬂow parameters
follow same hemispheric preference as that of magnetic and current helicity parameters,
i.e., hk and Ck are found to have dominantly negative (positive) sign in ARs of north-
ern(southern) hemisphere. This conﬁrms the earlier reports (Maurya, Ambastha, and Reddy,
2011; Seligman, Petrie, and Komm, 2014; Komm, Gosain, and Pevtsov, 2014; Komm and
Gosain, 2015). But Gao, Zhang, and Zhao (2009) have found opposite hemispheric prefer-
ences in a small sample of ARs. Further, we could not detect clear signature of equator-ward
propagating patterns in kinetic helicities of ARs as found for the magnetic helicities. Since
kinetic and current helicities are related by mean ﬁeld dynamo model such patterns are
expected to exist in both the parameters.

3 τ < u · ∇ × u >= − 1

The hemispheric preference of the parameter hk could be due to mean ﬁeld dynamo αd
(Biskamp, 2000, see Equation 5.19). Let us think of the hemispheric dependence of force-free
alpha αf , dynamo alpha αd and kinetic helicity, hk =< u · ∇ × u >≈ 3 < uz(∇ × u)z >.
According to the mean-ﬁeld dynamo, αd and hk are strongly related to each other by the
relation αd = − 1
3 hkτ , where τ is the velocity correlation time. Thus
hk and αd have opposite signs. In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force causes a ﬂow
to be left-helical and hk < 0. From our analysis, we have found statistically negative kinetic
helicity for ARs which support the mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory. Further, considering hk < 0,
we come to have αd > 0 in the northern hemisphere. This is commonly adopted view in
the solar dynamo. It also seems to be consistent with Joy’s law (Hale et al., 1919). The
condition of αd > 0 as well as the Joy’s law suggests that the larger-scale magnetic ﬁeld
comprising bipolar ARs may be right helical. On the other hand, the force-free alpha αf
is empirically found to be negative in the northern hemisphere. This means that magnetic
ﬁelds are left-helical in scales smaller than individual ARs.

The solar diﬀerential rotation may be another factor for the hemispheric trend of the sub-
photospheric ﬂows as rotation may introduce left- and right-handed vorticity in northern
and southern hemispheres with magnitude of 0.01 × 10−6s−1 to 2.5 × 10−6s−1 for an AR of
sizes 1 Mm to 40 Mm along the meridional direction.

The hemispheric preference for kinetic helicity is found to increase with depths. The
magnitude of peak of kinetic helicity distribution is found to increases with depth for both
hemispheric ARs while divergence-curl is found to be constant around depths 5 – 20 Mm.
The reason for growth in kinetic helicity with depth is mainly due to increase in vertical
velocity while constant value of the parameter Ck is caused by net eﬀects of increase in swirl
and decrease in divergence.

Our analysis shows interesting patterns of hemispheric preferences, of sub-photospheric
ﬂow topology, as a function of magnetic ﬁeld strength and depths. The HSR for sub-
photospheric ﬂows topology enhances with magnetic ﬁeld strength and with depths. Poor
hemispheric preferences of ﬂow topology near the photosphere, may be due to smaller plasma
density and diverging magnetic ﬁeld lines. This may be due to diﬀerent scales of magnetic
ﬁeld lines. This supports the solar dynamo theory which predicts the bi-helical properties of
magnetic ﬁelds (Blackman and Brandenburg, 2002; Brandenburg and Subramanian, 2005).
Further, we analysed the correlation between sub-photospheric ﬂows and photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds. The kinetic helicity, near the photosphere, do not show signiﬁcant relation
with magnetic or current helicities. But we found that the correlation between them enhances
as we go deeper into the solar interior. The kinetic helicity and vertical divergence-curl show

SOLA: ms_kmhel.tex; 25 June 2020; 0:42; p. 20

Topology of Solar Active Regions

correlation with magnetic and current helicities at all depths. Further, we found that the
kinetic helicity shows better covariance with magnetic and current helicities than divergence-
curl of ﬂow ﬁelds, which supports the mean ﬁeld dynamo models. Near-surface ﬂow topology
shows poor correlation with magnetic and current helicities. This suggests that the magnetic
ﬁelds and ﬂows may have diﬀerent topologies. Another reason could be the frozen-in ﬁeld
conditions in the interior plasma, which may not be satisﬁed at these depths and results into
weak association of magnetic and ﬂow ﬁelds. But deeper into the interior there is increasingly
high density plasma. There the ﬁeld lines may be concentrated close to the ﬂux tubes which
may lead to similar topology in both physical quantities.

It should be noted that we have used a single (or a few) vector magnetograms map
corresponding to an AR to derive the photospheric twist while the twist in sub-photospheric
ﬂow was obtained using the data cube for 1664 minutes. This could be one reason for weak
relation between the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and sub-photospheric ﬂows. But magnetic
helicity is likely to be approximately conserved in solar atmosphere on time scale of AR
while passing the disc (Berger and Field, 1984). It should also be noted that we have used
magnetic and Doppler ﬁelds observations obtained from diﬀerent sources. These factors may
be responsible in aﬀecting our results and in reducing correlations of the twist parameters. It
is expected that these results may improve in the future with magnetic and Doppler velocity
observations obtained from the same instrument.
