Abstract—Consider the problem of covertly controlling a linear
system. In this problem, Alice desires to control (stabilize or
change the parameters of) a linear system, while keeping an
observer, Willie, unable to decide if the system is indeed being
controlled or not.

We formally deﬁne the problem, under two different models:
(i) When Willie can only observe the system’s output (ii) When
Willie can directly observe the control signal. Focusing on AR(1)
systems, we show that when Willie observes the system’s output
through a clean channel, an inherently unstable linear system
can not be covertly stabilized. However, an inherently stable
linear system can be covertly controlled, in the sense of covertly
changing its parameter. Moreover, we give direct and converse
results for two important controllers: a minimal-information
controller, where Alice is allowed to used only 1 bit per sample,
and a maximal-information controller, where Alice is allowed to
view the real-valued output. Unlike covert communication, where
the trade-off is between rate and covertness, the results reveal
an interesting three–fold trade–off in covert control: the amount
of information used by the controller, control performance and
covertness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study
formally deﬁning covert control.

I. INTRODUCTION

The main objective in control theory is to develop algo-
rithms that govern or control systems. Usually, the purpose
of a selected algorithm is to drive the system to a desired
state (or keeping it at a certain range of states) while adhering
to some constraints such as rate of information, delay, power
and overshoot. Essentially, ensuring a level of control (under
some formal deﬁnition) subject to some (formally deﬁned)
constraint. Traditionally, the controller monitors the system’s
process and compares it with a reference. The difference
between the actual and desired value of the process (the error
signal) is analysed and processed in order to generate a control
action, which in tern is applied as a feedback to the system,
bringing the controlled process to its desired state.
Numerous systems require external control

in order to
operate smoothly. For example, various sensors in our power,
gas or water networks monitor the ﬂow and control it. We
use various signaling methods to control cameras in homeland
security applications or medical devices. In some cases, the
controlling signal is manual, while in others it is an automatic
signal inserted by a speciﬁc part of the application in charge
of control. In this paper, however, we extend the setup to
cases where achieving control over the system is not
the
only goal, and consider the control problem while adding an

additional constraint of covertness: either staying undetected
by an observer (taking the viewpoint of an illegitimate con-
troller), or being able to detect any control operation (taking
the viewpoint of a legitimate system owner). This additional
covertness constraint clearly seems reasonable in applications
such as security or surveillance systems, but, in fact, recent
attacks on medical devices [1] and civil infrastructures [2]
stress out the need to account for covert control in a far
wider spectrum of applications. As a result, it is natural to
ask: Can one covertly control a linear system? If so, in what
sense? When is it possible to identify with high probability
any attempt to covertly control a system? Do answers to the
above question depend on the type of controller used, in terms
of complexity or information gathered from the system?

While the problem we deﬁne herein is related to covert com-
munication, which was studied extensively in the information
theory community [3]–[8], key differences immediately arise.
First, in covert communication, Alice desires to covertly send a
message to Bob. Hence, ﬁxing a covertness constraint, Alice’s
success is measured in rate - the number of bits per channel use
she is able to send covertly. Herein, Alice’s objective is control,
which we measure in the ability to stabilize the system, or
change its parameters. Second, in the covert control setup,
we identify an additional dimension, which does not exist in
covert communication: the amount of information Alice has
to extract from the system in order to carry out her objective
(covertly control the system). Thus, it is clear there is a non-
trivial interplay between information, control and covertness,
adding depth and a multitude of open problems.

A. Main Contribution

In this paper, we focus on a simple linear system, schemati-
cally depicted in Figure 1. Alice, observing the system’s output
Xn, wishes to control the system’s behaviour though a control
signal Un. We assume the system without control follows a
ﬁrst order Auto Regressive model (AR(1)), hence,

Xn+1 = aXn + Zn − Un,

(1)

and focus on two types of control objectives: (i) Stabilizing
an otherwise unstable system. (ii) Changing the parameter (a)
of a stable system. However, Alice wishes to perform her
control action without being detected by Willie. We discuss
two different scenarios in terms of Willie’s observations. (i)
Willie is able to observe Alice’s control signal. (ii) Willie

Alice and Bob, wish to communicate, while preventing a third
party, Willie, from detecting the mere presence of communi-
cation. While studied in the steganography and spread spec-
trum communication literature [9]–[11], the ﬁrst information
theoretic investigation was done in [3], [12]. This seminal
work considered Additive White Gaussian Noise channels
(whose variances are known to all parties), and computed the
highest achievable rate between Alice and Bob, while ensuring
Willie’s sum of false alarm and missed detection probabilities
(α + β) is arbitrarily close to one. This, however, resulted
in a transmission rate which is asymptotically negligible,
n) bits for n channel uses. In fact, this “square
e.g., O(
root law” for covert communication holds more generally,
e.g., for Binary Symmetric Channels [4] and via channel
resolvability [6]. These works strengthened the insight that
forcing α + β arbitrarily close to 1, and assuming Willie uses
optimal detection strategies, results in a vanishing rate. In order
to achieve a strictly positive covert communication rate, Alice
and Bob need some advantage over Willie [5], [13]–[17], or,
alternatively, intelligently use the fact that Willie cannot use an
optimal detector in practice, or some key problem parameters
are beyond his reach. For example, [13] showed that if Willie
does not know his exact noise statistics, Alice can covertly
transmit O(n) bits over T transmission slots, one of which
she can utilize, where each slot duration can encompass n bit
codewords. The authors in [14] showed that if Alice and Bob
secretly pre-arrange on which out of T (n) slots Alice is going
to transmit, they can reliably exchange O((cid:112)n log T (n)) bits
on an AWGN channel covertly from Willie.

insights,

limits and important

A critical aspect of understanding communication systems
under practical constraints is their analysis and testing in ﬁnite
block length regimes. While asymptotic behaviour gives us
fundamental
is critical to
understand such systems with ﬁnite, realistic block lengths,
demanded by either complexity or delay constraints. The
ﬁrst studies were in [7], [18]–[23]. Needless to say, practical
constrains such as limited delay and ﬁnite blocks, may limit
the communication of Alice and Bob, yet, on the other hand,
may limit the warden’s ability to detect the communication,
hence it is not a priori clear which will have a stronger effect.
Several studies considered a model in which Alice and
Bob can utilize a friendly helper which can generate Artiﬁcial
Noise (AN) [24]–[27]. In those models, the jammer is consider
either to be an “outsider”, or just Bob utilizing an additional
antenna for transmitting AN. Those studies have shown an
improvement of the covert communication rate between Alice
and Bob compared to cases without a jammer.

2) Control: In many contemporary applications, however,
communication is used merely as means to accomplish a
certain task, namely, communication is needed since the data
required for the task is located on various (remote) sensors,
devices or network locations. The utility in such applications
depends on the task and thus, the tension when adding covert-
ness constraints is not necessarily just between covertness
and the number of bits transmitted, the task itself must be
accounted for. For example, in the context of covertness when

Fig. 1: A basic Covert Control model. Alice observes the
system’s output, and wishes to control the system, either using
a desired reference signal or without it. She can decide how
frequently and how accurately to sample the output on the one
hand, and how frequent and how strong will be her control
signal be, on the other. The control signal is an input to the
system, but it is also observed by Willie either explicitly (a), or
implicitly when observing the output of the system (b). In both
cases, Willie’s observations can be either clean, or viewed via
a noisy channel. Alice’s goal is to control the system without
being noticed. Willie’s goal is to detect if Alice is indeed
controlling the system.

can only observe the system’s output. In both cases, Willie’s
observations might be clean, or through a noisy channel.

We formally deﬁne covertness and detection in these scenar-
ios. We then show that an unstable AR(1) cannot be covertly
controlled, in the sense of maintaining a ﬁnite γ-moment
without being detected. On the other hand, we show that a
Gaussian stable AR(1) system can be covertly manipulated by
Alice, in the sense of changing its gain without being detected
by Willie. We then turn to speciﬁc results for two interesting,
limiting–cases controllers. The ﬁrst is a minimum–information
controller, in which Alice is allowed to retrieve only one bit per
sample. We show that under this strict information constraint,
Alice cannot covertly control the system, no matter if Willie
observes the control signal directly or only the system’s output.
On the other hand, we then turn to the opposite limiting case,
a maximum–information controller, in which Alice is allowed
to view the real–valued signal. We show that with maximum
information, if the system’s gain is small enough, Alice can
manipulate a system, “resetting” it to its initial value at a
time instance of her choice, without being detected by Willie.
Conversely, for a large enough system gain, Alice cannot reset
the system without being detected by Willie.

The results above, to the best of our knowledge, are the ﬁrst
to characterize cases where one can or cannot covertly control
a linear system. They reveal an important three–fold trade–off
between information, covertness and control, yet to be fully
characterized.

information gathered from the system and covertness – other
aspects come into play, such as stability, delay, etc.

Focusing on control applications, it is not a-priori clear
where to measure the control signal, and what are the interest-
ing trade–offs to characterize. For example, in [28] the authors
considered the minimum number of bits to stabilize a linear
system, i.e., the system in eq. (1), where {Zn} were assumed
independent random variables, with bounded α-th moments,
and {Un} were the control actions, chosen by a controller,
who received each time instant a single element of a ﬁnite
set {1, . . . , M }, as its only information about system state.
The authors showed that for |a| > 1 (an inherently unstable
system), M = (cid:98)a(cid:99) + 1 is necessary and sufﬁcient to achieve
β-moment stability, for any β < α. Their approach was to use
a normal/emergency (zoom-in/zoom-out) based controller, in
order to manage the magnitude of Xn. This control signal,
however, was not meant to be undetectable, and is indeed
far from covert. Similar to [28], [29]–[32] also considered
controlling a linear system, under different constraints, such
as rate and energy. Yet again, covertness was not taken into
account in these works.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

In the context of Figure 1 and eq. (1), this work is on the
following two cases. (i) Willie is observing Alice’s controller’s
output. (ii) Willie is observing Alice’s system’s output. In each
of the cases, Willie tries to detect any controlling action on
Alice’s part, by observing her controller’s output or system’s
output, through some channel (clean or noisy). In turn, Alice’s
will is to control her system, while staying undetected by
Willie. Alice’s system is modeled as an AR(1) system (eq. (1)),
where X0 = 0, a is the system gain, {Zn} are identically
independent random variables, and Un is the
distributed,
control action at time n. Choosing this kind of model stems
from the fact
that an AR(1) process is well-known, well
studied, and can constitute a simple model, on the one hand,
yet can capture the complexity of the problem on the other. It
can model systems with memory, having both random input,
and a built-in system’s gain.

The control signal, which we denote by Un, can function in
several manners. First, Alice can use it to stabilize the system,
with respect to some stabilization criteria. Second, Alice can
use it to alter the system’s parameters or to intervene with
the system’s operation process. For simplicity, we focus on
controllers of the form Un = f (Xn−1).

Any controller of the form Un = f (Xn−1) can use different
amount of information from Xn−1 in order to control the

system. This amount
Explicitly, f (·) can use all the information in Xn−1, i.e., use
inﬁnite number of bits representation of Xn−1, or use some
quantized value of Xn−1, i.e., use a ﬁnite number of bits in
order to represent Xn−1. In this work, besides the general
results, we also consider two different speciﬁc controllers,
which give a glimpse on the following two extreme cases.
First, the case in which a minimal amount of information is

taken from Xn−1, i.e., a single bit per sample. Second, the
case in which maximal information is taken from Xn−1, i.e.,
an inﬁnite number of bits. Those two controllers are given in
Deﬁnition 1 and Deﬁnition 2 below, respectively.

For an AR(1) system with limited support noises, i.e., {Zn}
for which there is a B > 0, such that for any n, |Zn| ≤ B,
we deﬁne the following controller.

Deﬁnition 1. Let U one

n as the threshold controller.

This intuitive controller acts as a reset to the system, that
is, when the system state crosses some level, which we denote
as D, the system returns to the initial state X0 = 0.

In order to measure the covertness of Alice’s control policy,
and the detectability at Willie side, we deﬁne a covertness
criterion and a detection criterion. Speciﬁcally, we introduce
the notion of ε-covertness and 1 − δ-detection. Denote by α
and β, the false alarm and miss detection probabilities for
hypothesis testing problem, respectively.

Deﬁnition 3. We say that ε-covertness is achieved by Alice,
if for some ε > 0 we have, α + β ≥ 1 − ε.

Deﬁnition 3 is a well-known criteria in covert communi-
cation, ﬁrst used in [3] to establish the fundamental limit
of covert communication, and next used ubiquitous, e.g., [4],
[13], [14], [33], [34].

Deﬁnition 4. We say that 1−δ-detection is achieved by Willie,
if for some δ > 0 we have, α + β ≤ δ.

III. MAIN RESULTS

In this section, the main results, which are divided into three
parts, will be presented. First, two general results (theorems 1
and 2). Then two converse results under minimal-information
controller (theorems 3 and 4) and two results under maximal-
information controller (theorems 5 and 6). The complete
proofs are given in section IV.

Theorem 1 states that an inherently unstable linear system,
i.e., an AR(1) system with |a| > 1, can not be covertly
stabilized. On the other hand, Theorem 2 states that an
inherently stable linear system, i.e., an AR(1) system with
|a| < 1, can be covertly controlled. In Theorem 1 the sta-
bilization criteria in mind is the absolute γ-moment stability,
i.e., E [|Xn|γ] ≤ c < ∞. Hence, the meaning of stabilizing an

unstable system is to achieve a ﬁnite absolute γ-moment for
the system state. Conversely, a system with |a| < 1 is already
stable, thus, stabilization action is not needed. However, if
Alice desires to alter or interfere with the system’s operation,
it is possible to do so while keeping Willie ignorant about
those actions. In Theorem 2 below, Alice desires to change
the gain of the system, i.e., her goal is to change an AR(1)
system with a gain of a, to an AR(1) system with a gain of b.

Theorem 1. Consider the linear stochastic system in eq. (1),
with |a| > 1, an i.i.d. Zn and a control signal Un which keeps
the system γ-moment stable. If Willie has a uniform bound on
the system’s γ-moment, i.e., E [|Xn|γ] ≤ c < ∞ and observes
the system’s output through a clean channel, he can achieve
1 − δ-detection, i.e., identify the control operation.

If,

in adition, Zn is a Gaussian noise, Willie needs to

Theorem 1 asserts that any attempt to covertly stabilize
an inherently unstable AR(1) system, under the conditions of
the claim, will lead to a failure. Under Gaussian noise, the
theorem also gives an easy handle on where should Willie
observe the system for any speciﬁc δ. In addition, the theorem
can be easily generalized to a scenario in which Willie is
observing the system’s output through a noisy channel. This
will only force Willie to increase the length and position of
his observation interval, but the heart of the result remains.

Theorem 2. Consider the linear stochastic system given in
eq. (1) for |a| < 1, in steady state, Zn ∼ N (0, σ2
Z) i.i.d. and
Un = (a − b)Xn−1, where 0 < |a| < |b| < 1 and sgn (a) =
sgn (b). If Willie observes the system’s output through a clean
channel, for a time window n < 2b
b−a , knows Un and b satisﬁes
|b| < (cid:112)1 − (1 − a2)e−4(cid:15)2, then for any method of detection
that Willie will use, Alice achieves an (cid:15)-covertness for any
(cid:15) > 0.

In other words, Theorem 2 states that with no information
constraint on Alice’s behalf, an inherently stable AR(1) system
can be covertly controlled, in the sense that Alice can change
the system’s gain, a, to a different one, b, without being
detected by Willie. Again, Theorem 2 can be easily generalized
to the scenario in which Willie observes the system’s output
trough a noisy channel, which in turn enables Alice to use
further away b’s then in the claim. However, Theorem 2 gives
us a look at the best case that Willie can have (a clean channel),
and still assures us that Willie can not detect Alice’s control
actions.

The proof of Theorem 1 is based on the fact that an AR(1)
process with |a| > 1 is unstable and its moments diverge [38],
thus, by observing the system’s output far enough, Willie can
make a calculated decision if Alice is stabilizing her system

or not. However, the proof of Theorem 2 is more intricate. It
is based on (from Alice’s side) creating a system for which
the distribution of an n-tuple is very close to the original one
in terms of divergence. By doing so, Willie would not be able
to distinguish between the two distributions.

A. Converse results under a minimal-information controller

Consider now a setting in which Willie observes the con-
troller’s output trough a noisy channel. The following theorem
introduces the case in which Willie observes Alice’s one-bit
controller’s output through a noisy channel. It asserts that
Willie can achieve 1 − δ-detection, for any δ > 0, as the
number of observations increases.

This scenario is realistic in cases Willie dominates the
channel Alice might have between her and the system. In
this cases, it is also probable that an observer will know
his channel characteristics, but not always have the resources
to observe the controller in each time sample in which the
system operates. Yet, as Theorem 3 asserts, if Willie observes
the controller’s output for a time period large enough, Willie
can detect Alice’s control actions and keep the sum of his
error probabilities arbitrary small. Moreover, Theorem 4 adds
another dimension to these results, stating that even in the case
in which Willie observes the system’s output, an inherently
stable AR(1) cannot be covertly controlled by Alice if she uses
the one-bit controller. Note, however, that these two results are
under a minimal information controller, limiting Alice’s ability
to gather enough information before each control decision.
The results in the next subsection will show that with more
information, Alice can do better and stay undetected.

Theorem 3. Consider an AR(1) system with a (cid:54)= 2, which
Alice stabilizes using the one-bit controller of Deﬁnition 1.
Willie observes the control signal through an AWGN for K
consecutive samples. The noise variance in Willie’s channel,
σ2
v, is known to Willie.
For any δ > 0, Willie can achieve 1 − δ-detection as long

as the observation window satisﬁes K > K0(δ) for

Very roughly speaking, the proof is based on the fact that
the one–bit controller is coarse, using strong control actions,
and hence is detectable with energy detection.

Theorem 4. Consider an AR(1) system with |a| < 1, and Un
as the one-bit controller. If Willie observes the system’s output

B. Results under a maximal-information controller

Finally, we turn to a maximum–information controller,
and Alice’s ability to covertly control under it. Theorem 5
introduces an achievable range of gains of an AR(1) system,
for which Alice can use the threshold controller while staying
undetected by Willie. I.e., the claim shows that Alice can
achieve ε-covertness for any ε > 0. It is restricted, however, to
the case of one control action in the system’s operation time,
and for the case of inherently stable AR(1) system, i.e., |a| < 1
and under steady-state conditions. On the other hand, Willie is
observing the system’s output through a clean channel, for the
whole of the system’s operation time, and he is unrestricted
in terms of complexity or strategy used.

Theorem 5. Consider a Gaussian AR(1) system with |a| < 1.
Alice is using the threshold controller, and Willie is observing
to the system’s output through a clean channel. If the system is
being controlled by resetting at one time sample 1 ≤ τ ≤ N ,
i.e., Xτ +1 = Zτ +1, and the system’s gain, a, satisﬁes |a| ≤
√
1 − 2−4ε2, then for any method of detection that Willie will

use, Alice achieves ε-covertness for any ε > 0.

The proof is based on computing the output distributions
under both hypotheses. Note, however, that the distribution
under the control hypothesis depends on τ , whose distribution
is unknown. The result uses distribution–independent bounds
on the relevant divergence.

Next, we introduce a converse result to Theorem 5. Theo-
rem 6 asserts that Willie can achieve an 1 − δ-detection for
any δ > 0, as long as the gain of the system is considerably
close to one. Note, however, that it gives Willie extra power,
knowing the time Alice might activate the control. On the
other hand, Willie observes the system only at that time.

Theorem 6. Consider a Gaussian AR(1) system. Alice is using
the threshold controller, and Willie is observing the system’s
output through a clean channel. If Willie knows the one time
sample in which the system is being resets 1 ≤ τ ≤ N , i.e.,
Xτ +1 = Zτ +1, and the system’s gain, a, satisﬁes

B. Proof of Theorem 1
Proof. (Theorem 1) An AR(1) process with a gain |a| > 1
is not stable, in the sense that the second moment of the
process goes to inﬁnity with time, i.e., E (cid:2)X 2
∞
[38]. Therefore, if Willie observes the system’s output through
a clean channel, at a far enough time sample, he can decide
with high conﬁdence if Alice is stabilizing the system or not,
namely, if the system state stays in some bounded region, or
tents to inﬁnity, respectively.

(cid:3) −−−−→

n→∞

n

The detection method Willie uses is as follows: Willie
time n0 and check if its
observes the system’s output at
absolute value is bigger or smaller than some deterministic
number M , i.e., Willie observes Xn0 and compares |Xn0| with
M .

This analysis can be formulated as the following hypothesis

testing problem,

H0 :
n ≥ 1,
Xn = aXn−1 + Zn,
H1 : Xn = aXn−1 + Zn − Un, n ≥ 1,

where Un is such that E [|Xn0|γ] ≤ c. Hence, we bound the

miss detection probability as follows,

Σ0, and the other with a gain of b and a covariance matrix
Σ1. For |a|, |b| < 1, we have

β =P {|Xn0| > M |H1}
E [|Xn0|γ|H1]
(a)
≤
M γ

(c)
≤

(d)

,

where (a) is due to Markov’s inequality, (b) since Un
stabilizes the system in the sense that E [|Xn0 |γ|H1] ≤ c < ∞.
(cid:113) 2c
(d) is when Willie sets M ≥ γ

δ to get β ≤ δ
2 .

On the other hand, if H0 is true, than |Xn0 | should be big
with high probability. Thus, the probability of Willie to falsely
decide that Alice is stabilizing the system when she is not, is
when |Xn0| is smaller than some big enough constant M ,
hence, we evaluate the false alarm probability as follows,

C. Proof of Theorem 2

First, we prove the next supporting claim.

Claim 1. Consider two n-tuple Gaussian AR(1) processes in

Proof. For |a|, |b| < 1, and in steady state, by Lemma 1 and
Remark 1.1, [Σ0]i,j = σ2
1−b2 b|i−j|
for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Denote [A]i,j = a|i−j| and [B]i,j = b|i−j|
for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. To show that

In this subsection, the proof of Theorem 3 and its supporting
claims will be presented. We start with three supporting
claims.

Claim 2. The linear stochastic system shown in eq. (1),
initializes at n = 0 (thus X0 = 0), can be represented for
an arbitrary controller Un as follows,

Proof. (Theorem 2) Alice’s goal is to convert a given AR(1)
system with a gain of a, to another AR(1) system with a
gain of b. In Willie’s side, this case can be formulated as
the following hypothesis testing problem,

Xk =

k
(cid:88)

m=1

ak−m (Zm − Um),

∀k ∈ N, a ∈ R,

(10)

H0 : Xn = aXn−1 + Zn, n ≥ 1,
H1 : Xn = bXn−1 + Zn, n ≥ 1.

Since Zn ∼ N (0, σ2

Z) i.i.d., then X(n)|H0 ∼ N (0, Σ0)
1−a2 a|i−j| and
1−b2 b|i−j| for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, respectively (see

and X(n)|H1 ∼ N (0, Σ1), where [Σ0]i,j = σ2
[Σ1]i,j = σ2
Lemma 1 and Remark 1.1).

where Xk is the system state at time k.

Proof. The proof is by induction. Clearly, for k = 1 the claim
holds since,

The logarithm is by the substitution of |Σ0| = σ2n

Hence, by mathematical induction eq. (10) holds.

Claim 3. The One-bit controller, shown in eq. (2), can be
written as,

(11)

where C1 ≥ B

1−a/2 is the ﬁrst element in the series Cn, B
is the bound of the noise Zn, .i.e., |Zn| ≤ B, ∀n ≥ 1 and
a (cid:54)= 2 is the gain of the system shown in eq. (1).

Proof. By eq. (2), one has to show that the following holds,

Cn−1 =

B

+

(cid:16) a
2

(cid:17)n−2 (cid:18)

C1 −

B

First, we will prove the following by induction,

Cn =

where k is some shift of the series Cn. For instance, if
k = 1 we have Cn = (a/2)Cn−1 + B, which is by deﬁnition.
Assume eq. (13) holds for k = r, then for k = r + 1,

Cn =

∀n > 1,

(16)

since a/2 < 1. As n → ∞, eqs. (15) to (16) also holds
regardless of the choice of C1 (however, it has to be greater
or equal to
1−a/2 ). Thus, one can deduce that |Un| converges.
I.e., |Un| can not get arbitrary large.

Next, we give an upper and lower bounds for the energy of

the control signal shown in eq. (2).

Claim 4. The energy of the controller in eq. (2), is bounded
by,

number which sustains C1 ≥ B

B, where B is the noise bound, and a ∈ R, a (cid:54)= 2 (see
Deﬁnition 1).

where (a) is since Cn is a monotonically decreasing series

converging to:

Remark 4.1. Since C1 can be arbitrary number which sus-
1−a/2 , for simplicity, we set C1 = B
tains C1 ≥ B
1−a/2 unless
otherwise stated, thus,

EU =

(cid:18) aB

(cid:19)2

(18)

which yields a constant energy with respect to time.
Furthermore, from eq. (16), the above also holds as N → ∞
regardless of the choice of C1 (however, C1 has to be greater
1−a/2 ). Hence, the average energy of eq. (2) in
or equal to
steady state, is given by eq. (18) regardless of the choice of
C1.

By claim 2 in [3], one can show that Alice cannot covertly
control her system, as Willie’s observations window increases.
However, we will show a detailed proof for Theorem 3.

Proof. (Theorem 3) Willie observes Alice’s control signal
through an AWGN for K consecutive samples. Willie’s ob-
servation at time sample n is simply Wn = Un + vn, where
Un is Alice’s control signal, vn ∼ N (0, σ2
v) is an i.i.d.
noise and the noise variance, σ2
v, is known to Willie. Since,
Un (cid:54)= 0 ∀n > 1, i.e., Alice always controlling the system,
then for any K consecutive samples the average energy that
(cid:80)
Willie reads is: EW = 1
n (Un + vn)2. Hence, Willie will
K
compare EW to the noise energy in his channel, i.e., σ2
v.

Willie has the following hypotheses

H0 :
n = k, . . . , K + k − 1,
H1 : Wn = Un + vn, n = k, . . . , K + k − 1.

Wn = vn,

Thus, the mean and the variance of his energy, EW , when

H0 is true are,

E [EW |H0] =σ2

Proof. (Theorem 4) Willie is observing to Alice’s system’s
output through a clean channel, when |a| < 1 and in steady
state. Therefore, Willie’s observation at time n, is an AR(1)
signal controlled or not. We prove the impossibility of covert
control in this case, using the following detection method:
Willie observes the system’s output through a clean channel
for K + 1 samples, in any time sample n Willie evaluates:
Yn (cid:44) Xn − aXn−1, and then calculates the average energy
of Yn, i.e., EW = 1
n . Willie compares EW to some
K
expected energy level, in order to decide if the system is being
controlled or not.

and rejects it otherwise. Suppose that Willie desires a false

Willie preforms hypotheses testing approach to decide if
Alice is controlling the system or not, he uses the following
hypotheses,

H0 :
n = k, . . . , K + k − 1,
H1 : Yn = Zn − Un, n = k, . . . , K + k − 1.

Yn = Zn,

Under the null hypothesis, Willie observes an i.i.d. process,

by doing so, Willie can detect with arbitrarily low error
probability Alice’s control actions with the one-bit controller,
i.e., Willie achieves 1 − δ-detection for any δ > 0.

F. Proof of Theorem 5

In this subsection, the supporting claims of Theorem 5 and

their proofs will be presented.

In order to prove Theorem 5, we will use lemmas 2 and 3
to bound the sum of error probabilities. For doing so, we ﬁrst
give several supporting claims to upper bound the relevant
Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Consider a speciﬁc case of a Gaussian AR(1) system,
with and without the threshold controller. In this case, given
Xk−1 = xk−1, Xk ∼ N (axk−1, σ2
∀2 ≤ k ≤ τ , where τ
is the ﬁrst threshold crossing time and X0 = 0.

Denote X(n) (cid:44) [X1, X2, . . . , Xn]T . For n ≤ τ , i.e., without
any control action, the probability density function of an AR(1)
process, can be easily evaluated (see Lemma 1). First, we note
the following.

Z),

Claim 5. Assume that an AR(1) system operates with the
threshold controller, for a total of N time samples, and there
is only one crossing time which we indicate as τ1 < N .
Then, X(1,τ1)|τ =τ1 = [X1, . . . , Xτ1 ]T and X(τ1+1,N )|τ =τ1 =
[Xτ1+1, . . . , XN ]T are two independent random vectors.

Proof. Since the threshold controller operates only at τ1 + 1,
which we assumed to be known, then Uτ1+1 = aXτ1 and
otherwise Un = 0. I.e., the system operates undisturbed for
τ1 < N time samples, which constitute an AR(1) process at
that interval. On the other hand, after a correction has been
made, the system state Xτ1+1 = aXτ1 + Zτ1+1 − Uτ1+1 =
Zτ1+1, have the same distribution as X1 = Z1, since Zn is an
i.i.d. process. Therefore, X(1,τ1)|τ =τ1 and X(τ1+1,N )|τ =τ1 have
the same distribution, but with possibly different dimensions,
and can be written as,

X(1,τ1)|τ =τ1 =

X(τ1+1,N )|τ =τ1 =

hence, X(N )|τ =τ1 can be written as,

Now, Z is an i.i.d. random vector, thus X(1,τ1)

|=X(τ1+1,N ).

In terms of the density function, we have the following.

Claim 6. Consider a Gaussian AR(1) system. When using the
threshold controller, the PDF of the system state vector X(N )
conditioned to τ , when there is only one crossing time, is given
by

I.e., X(N ) ∼ N (0, ΣN ) and ΣN is a covariance matrix of

Remark 6.1. In general, assume that the system operates with
the threshold controller for a total of N time samples. Let us
indicate {τk}m
k=1 as the series of crossing times. Therefore,
eq. (29) is true for any τk + 1 ≤ n ≤ τk+1 ∀k ∈ Z+, where
τ0 = 0. In addition, as a result of the independence of the

aN −τ1−1 aN −τ1−2

tion is been made, thus

Recall that an n-tupple of a Gaussian AR(1) process with
|a| < 1 at steady state, has the following covariance matrix
[Σ]i,j = σ2

1−a2 a|i−j|. Hence, in our case,

thus,

[Σ11]i,j = [Στ1 ]i,j ,

Now, we move to the second part of the proof. We use
=

a LU decomposition for the matrix deﬁned as

(cid:104) ˆAn

(cid:105)

a|i−j|,
1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Where the lower triangular matrix
Ln deﬁned as [Ln]i,j = ai−ju(i − j),
1 ≤ i, j ≤ n,
and the upper triangular matrix Un deﬁned as [Un]i,j =
aj−i(1 − a2)(1−δ(i−1))u(j − i),
1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Where δ(·)
denote the Kronecker’s delta, and u(·) is the discrete step
function. If so,

i,j

We can now give the proof of Theorem 5, which asserts that
if the gain, a, is small enough, then Willie which observes the
system’s output, cannot distinguish if any control action is
been made by Alice. I.e., Willie cannot know if the system
operates for n samples without interference, or that Alice
performes a reset.

for k > 1. (c) is due to sum of geometric series. (d) is by

Now, consider that [Ln]i,i = 1 and [Un]i,i = δ(i − 1) + (1 −

G. Proof of Theorem 6

Proof. Consider the following hypotheses testing problem that
Willie uses, in order to detect Alice’s control actions using the

bution of Xτ +1 is given by the distribution of a steady state
