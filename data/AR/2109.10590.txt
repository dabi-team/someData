ABSTRACT

For the ﬁrst time, the argon abundance relative to hydrogen abundance (Ar/H)
in the narrow line region of a sample of Seyfert 2 nuclei has been derived. In view of
this, optical narrow emission line intensities of a sample of 64 local Seyfert 2 nuclei
(z < 0.25) taken from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 and measured by the MPA/JHU
group were considered. We adopted the Te-method for AGNs, which is based on direct
determination of the electron temperature, together with a grid of photoionization
model results, built with the Cloudy code, to obtain a method for the derivation of the
Ar/H abundance. We ﬁnd that for a metallicity range of 0.2 <
∼ 2.0, Seyfert 2
nuclei present Ar/H abundance ranging from ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 3 times the argon solar
value, adopting log(O/H)(cid:12) = −3.31 and log(Ar/H)(cid:12) = −5.60. These range of values
correspond to 8.0 <
∼ 9.0 and 5.4 <
∼ 6.9, respectively.
The range of Ar/H and Ar/O abundance values obtained from our sample are in
consonance with estimations from extrapolations of the radial abundance gradients
to the central parts of the disk for four spiral galaxies. We combined our abundance
results with estimates obtained from a sample of H ii galaxies, which were taken from
the literature, and found that the Ar/O abundance ratio decreases slightly as the O/H
abundance increases.

emission-lines in their optical spectra, which when combined
with hydrogen recombination lines, make it possible to esti-
mate the abundance of heavy elements and the metallicity in
the gas phase of these objects. AGNs play an essential role
in chemical abundance studies of nearby objects and of the
early stages of galaxy formation due to the aforementioned
feature and to their high luminosity.

Among the heavy elements, oxygen presents strong
emission lines (i.e. [O ii]λ3726, λ3729; [O iii]λ5007) emitted
by its most abundant ions (O+, O2+) in the optical spec-
trum of gaseous nebulae (H ii regions, Planetary Nebulae)
and AGNs (e.g. Koski 1978; van Zee et al. 1998; Kennicutt
et al. 2003; Maciel et al. 2007; Dopita et al. 2015; Flury &
Moran 2020; Dors et al. 2020a). Therefore, the total metal-
licity (Z) of the gas phase from emission lines emitter objects
is commonly traced by the oxygen abundance relative to hy-

drogen (O/H, e.g. McGaugh 1991; Yates et al. 2012; Kewley
et al. 2019). Other elements such as the noble gases (e.g.
Ne, Ar) present emission-lines in the optical spectrum emit-
ted by only few of their ions (e.g. Ne2+, Ar2+), which make
it necessary to apply Ionization Correction Factors (ICFs)
proposed by Peimbert & Costero (1969) (see Stasińska 2002;
Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014; Dors et al. 2013, 2016) in order
to account for the unobserved ions in the estimation of the
total abundance. The use of ICFs can introduce uncertain-
ties in order of 20% (e.g. Henry et al. 1996; Alexander &
Balick 1997; Croxall et al. 2016) in the resulting total abun-
dance (for a detailed discussion on ICF uncertainties see
Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014). Despite this drawback, noble
gases can be used to derive the metallicity with some advan-
tages over oxygen, as they are also useful elements for deter-
mining constraints in stellar nucleosynthesis studies. Noble
gas atoms can not combine in molecules formation and they
can not be trapped in dust grains due to their quantum con-
ﬁguration, unlike the oxygen which is depleted onto dust in
order of 0.1 dex (e.g. Izotov et al. 2006; Pilyugin et al. 2007).

The Te-method, which is based on direct estimation of

 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Monteiro & Dors

the electron temperature, is widely used in the literature
as the most reliable approach for determining the chemi-
cal abundance of heavy metals in gaseous nebulae (for a
review see Peimbert et al. 2017; Pérez-Montero 2017). The
Te-method has been bolstered by the consonance between
O/H abundance estimates in H ii regions in the solar vicinity
and those obtained from observations of the weak interstellar
O iλ1356 line towards stars (see Pilyugin 2003 and references
therein). Moreover, in the Milky Way and in nearby galax-
ies, good agreement between O/H abundance estimates in
H ii regions and in B-type stars has recently been derived
(e.g. Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2017). In this regard, abun-
dance determinations of heavy metals (O, N, S, Ar, etc.)
based on the Te-method have been carried out in thousands
of star-forming regions (SFs; i.e. H ii regions, H ii galaxies)
at the local universe and for certain objects at high redshifts
over decades (see Dors et al. 2020a and reference therein).

Unfortunately, the situation is opposite for AGNs,
where, except from oxygen, the majority of the abundances
for other elements are not available in the literature. In fact,
the most complete metal abundance determinations based
on Te-method was carried out by Osterbrock & Miller (1975)
for Cygnus A (z = 0.05607), who derived the O, N, Ne, S,
and Fe abundances in relation to hydrogen. After this pio-
neering work some few studies have applied the Te-method
to abundance estimations in AGNs, however, in most cases,
only oxygen abundance determinations have been derived
(e.g. Alloin et al. 1992; Izotov & Thuan 2008; Revalski et al.
2018a,b, 2021; Dors et al. 2015, 2020b,a). Recently, Flury &
Moran (2020), adopting a methodology based on a reverse-
engineering of the Te-method, derived the ﬁrst (N/O)-(O/H)
relation for AGNs. Although studies relied on photoioniza-
tion models have been applied to derive metal abundance
in AGNs (e.g. Stasińska 1984; Ferland & Osterbrock 1986;
Storchi-Bergmann et al. 1998a; Groves et al. 2006; Feltre
et al. 2016; Castro et al. 2017; Pérez-Montero et al. 2019;
Thomas et al. 2019; Carvalho et al. 2020; Dors et al. 2021;
Pérez-Díaz et al. 2021), most of them have produced only
estimations for O/H or metallicity. Since the electron tem-
peratures throughout the emission nebula are computed by
thermal balancing (see the seminal paper by Williams 1967),
the abundances of the most important elements are used as
input parameters in photoionization models. All the lines,
even if not observed, contribute to the gas cooling rate. In
most of the papers which describe the results obtained by us-
ing photoionization models, the element relative abundances
to H, which were not found to be particularly diﬀerent from
the solar ones, are unfortunately not published in the liter-
ature.

The use of photoionization model to derive abundance
of diﬀerent elements other than the oxygen (e.g. N, S, Ar) is
(relatively) diﬃcult, hence, it is necessary to ﬁnd a solution
for the electron temperature (or for O/H, the main cooler
element) and for the ionization degree of the gas. After-
wards, the lines of the element under study must be adjusted
in order to obtain its abundance (see, for instance, Pérez-
Montero & Díaz 2007; Pérez-Montero et al. 2010; Contini
2017; Congiu et al. 2017; Dors et al. 2017; Polles et al. 2019;
Dors et al. 2021). This procedure can produce a degeneracy
among nebular parameters, resulting in somewhat uncertain
elemental abundances (Morisset et al. 2016; Morisset 2018).
In this sense, the use of the Te-method produces more ex-

act elemental abundance values in comparison with those
estimated through photoionization models.

In particular, the argon abundance determination in
AGNs is very important in the study of galaxy evolution
and stellar nucleosynthesis, since the stellar production and
later ejection of this element to the Interstellar Medium
(ISM) in the high metallicity regime can be accessed. The
stellar nucleosynthesis theory predicts a primary origin for
oxygen and argon (also for sulphur and neon) which are pre-
dominantly produced on relatively short timescales by core-
collapse supernovae (SNe; massive stars) explosions (e.g.
Woosley & Weaver 1995). Thus, assuming a universal Ini-
tial Mass Function (IMF)1, there is expectation for a rel-
atively constant value of the Ar/O abundance ratio with
the O/H (or metallicity) variation, as derived by several au-
thors in chemical abundance studies of SFs (e.g. Thuan et al.
1995; Izotov & Thuan 1999; van Zee & Haynes 2006; Gu-
seva et al. 2011; van Zee & Haynes 2006). However, some
authors have found diﬀerent behaviour of Ar/O with O/H.
For example, Izotov et al. (2006), who used a large sam-
ple of star-forming galaxies whose observational data were
taken from SDSS-DR3 (Abazajian et al. 2005), found that
Ar/O abundance ratio decreases by 0.15 dex with the in-
crease of O/H for the range 7.1 <
∼ 8.5
(see also Pérez-Montero et al. 2007). On the other hand,
recent results from the CHAOS project (Berg et al. 2015)
derived by Berg et al. (2020), who applied the Te-method to
190 individual H ii regions located in nearby galaxies, found
Ar/O about constant and similar to the solar value for the
range 8.3 <
∼ 9.0, and a high decrease of this
abundance ratio for the very low abundance regime. Finally,
Kennicutt et al. (2003) hinted that the Ar/O abundance de-
creases at high metallicity (8.5 <
∼ 8.7) in
the M 101 spiral galaxy.
For
the
(12 +
log(O/H) >
∼ 8.8), the behaviour of Ar/O with O/H is
poorly known as well as its abundance in AGNs. Recently,
Dors et al. (2020a) adapted the Te-method to chemical
abundance studies of AGNs, which made it possible to
obtain direct O/H estimates up-to the very high metallicity
regime, i.e. 12 + log(O/H) ≈ 9.3, an abundance value which
is about 0.3 dex higher than the maximum value obtained
for SFs (Pilyugin et al. 2007; Berg et al. 2020). Therefore,
abundance studies in AGNs through the Te-method allow
for the calculations of reliable Ar/H abundances in this class
of object and further investigating the Ar/O-O/H relation
at very high metallicity regime, which is inaccessible in SF
abundance studies.

In this context, we used the Te-method and developed
a new methodology based on photoionization model to cal-
culate the abundance of the argon relative to hydrogen in
the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of Seyfert 2 galaxies, whose
data were taken from the SDSS-DR7 (York et al. 2000). The
present study is organized as follows. In Section 2, the ob-
servational data and the methodology used to estimate the
oxygen and argon abundances are presented. The results and
the discussion are presented in Sect. 3. Finally, the conclu-
sion of the outcome is given in Sect. 4.

are classiﬁed as AGNs, otherwise, as SFs, is shown. It can
be seen that the sample cover a large range of ionization
degree and metallicity hence a wide range of [O iii]/Hβ and
[N ii]/Hα are observed (e.g. Groves et al. 2006; Feltre et al.
2016; Carvalho et al. 2020).

The electron density (Ne) of each one of the 64 Seyfert 2
nuclei was calculated from the [S ii]λ6716/λ6731 line ratio,
assuming an electron temperature of 10 000 K, and using
the PyNeb routine (Luridiana et al. 2015). In Fig. 2 a his-
togram with the Ne distribution of our sample is shown. It
can be seen that the Ne values for our sample (the maximum
value is about 3000 cm−3) are lower than the critical density
(i.e. 104−8 cm−3, see Vaona et al. 2012) of the emission lines
involved in the present study, therefore, eﬀects of collisional
de-excitation are negligible in our abundance estimates. In
Dors et al. (2020b), a complete description of the selection
criteria adopted to obtain the sample as well as a discus-
sion about aperture eﬀects on the abundance determination
is presented. Moreover, eﬀects of electron density variation
along the AGN radius, X-Ray dominated regions, shock and
electron temperature ﬂuctuations in abundance determina-
tions have been discussed by Dors et al. (2020a) and Dors
et al. (2021) and these are not repeated here.

2.2 Te-method

It was possible to estimate the Ar/H and O/H abundances
through the Te-method for the sample of 64 objects. In view
of the Te-method, we followed a similar methodology pro-
posed by Pérez-Montero (2017) and Dors et al. (2020a).

2 METHODOLOGY

To determine the total abundance of the argon and oxy-
gen in relation to hydrogen abundance (Ar/H, O/H), ﬁrstly,
we consider optical emission-line intensities of AGNs type
Seyfert 2 from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7
(SDSS-DR7, York et al. 2000). These observational data
were used to calculate the Ar/H and O/H abundances using
the Te-method. We used photoionization models, built with
the Cloudy code (Ferland et al. 2017), in order to obtain
an ICF for the Ar2+ and an estimation of the temperature
for the gas region occupied by this ion. In what follows, a
description of the observational data and the methodology
adopted to obtain the abundances are presented.

2.1 Observational data

We used optical (3000 < λ(Å) < 7200) reddening-corrected
emission-line intensities of a sample of Seyfert 2 nuclei ob-
tained from the SDSS-DR7 (York et al. 2000) data made
available by MPA/JHU group2. The sample consists of 463
Seyfert 2 nuclei with redshift z <
∼ 0.4 and stellar masses of
∼ log(M/M(cid:12)) <
the hosting galaxies in the range of 9.4 <
∼ 11.6
selected by Dors et al. (2020b). From this sample, we con-
sidered a sub-sample containing only objects which have the
[O ii]λ3726+3729, [O iii]λ4363, [O iii]λ5007, Hα, [S ii]λ6716,
[S ii]λ6731 and [Ar iii]λ7135 emission-lines measured with an
error lower than 50 %. This criterion reduced the sample to
64 objects out of the 463 selected by Dors et al. (2020b), with
∼ z <

2.2.1 Oxygen abundance

First, for each object, we calculated the temperature of the
high ionisation gas zone (t3) and the electron density (Ne)
based on the dependence of these nebular parameters on
the [O iii](λ4949+λ5007)/λ4363 and [S ii]λ6716/λ6731 line
ratios, respectively. We used the function getCrossTem-
Den from the PyNeb code (Luridiana et al. 2015), where
the value of each parameter was obtained by interacting over
the two sensitive line ratios above. The errors in Ne and t3
were calculated adding a Monte Carlo random-gauss values
to the sample with the function addMonteCarloObs in
the PyNeb code. The symbol t3 represents the electron tem-
perature in units of 104 K. The mean value derived for t3
from our sample is ∼ 1.5 and the uncertainty is ∼ 0.3. For
the electron density, we found a mean value of 470 cm−3 and
an uncertainty of ∼ 250 cm−3.

Since it is not possible to estimate the temperature for
the low ionization gas zone (t2) due to the absence of the
auroral [N ii]λ5755 and [O ii]λ7319, λ7330 line intensities,
the following theoretical relation (Eq. 2) between t2-t3, de-
rived by Dors et al. (2020a) for chemical abundance studies
of AGNs and obtained by using a photoionzation model grid
built with the Cloudy code (Ferland et al. 2013) by Car-
valho et al. (2020), was adopted:

t2 = (a × t3

3) + (b × t2

3) + (c × t3) + d,

(2)

where a = 0.17, b = −1.07, c = 2.07 and d = −0.33, while
t2 and t3 are in units of 104 K. In Riﬀel et al. (2021) this
theoretical t2-t3 relation was compared with direct electron
temperature estimations, calculated through observational
auroral emission lines for a sample of AGNs, and a good
agreement was found between them. However, these authors
indicated that some cautions must be taken into account in
the use of Eq. 2 for AGNs with strong outﬂowing gas.

To calculate the ionic abundances of O2+ and O+ rel-
ative to H+ the expressions provided by Pérez-Montero

respectively, where ne is the electron density Ne in units of

the determination of t2. Thus, in the derivation of O2+/H+
ionic abundance the uncertainties of the [O iii]/Hβ line ratio
and of t3 were taken into account. The same procedure was
considered for the derivation of O+/H+, where the ne and
t2 uncertainties were also taken into account.

Finally, the total abundance of the oxygen is approxi-

expressions proposed by Torres-Peimbert & Peimbert (1977)
and Izotov et al. (2006), due to the absence of the He iiλ4686
emission line in our observational data. Therefore, we as-
sumed ICF(O)=1.20, an average value obtained by Flury &
Moran (2020) and Dors et al. (2020a). Oxygen ICF values
translates into an abundance correction for AGNs of ∼0.1
dex, which is in agreement with the uncertainty derived in
H ii regions via Te-method estimates (e.g. Kennicutt et al.
2003; Hägele et al. 2008; Berg et al. 2020).

2.2.2 Argon abundance

Generally, to estimate the temperature of the electrons ex-
citating the Ar2+, the approach proposed by Garnett (1992)
which is based on photoionization model results is assumed
in chemical abundance studies of SFs (e.g. Kennicutt et al.
2003; Hägele et al. 2008). A similar electron temperature is
assumed for the gas regions where the Ar2+ and S2+ ions
are located, i.e.
Te(Ar iii) = Te(S iii).

However, Dors et al. (2020a) showed that, in general,
AGNs present a distinct electron temperature structure than
H ii regions (see also Dors et al. 2021; Riﬀel et al. 2021;
Armah et al. 2021). Thus, it is worthwhile to ascertain the
validity of Eqs. 6 and 7 for AGNs. In view of this, we used
the results from the photoionization model grid by Carvalho
et al. (2020) and considered predictions for Te(A iii) and
Te(S iii). This grid of photoionization models considered a
wide range of AGN nebular parameters whose optical pre-
dicted emission lines reproduce those of a large sample of
Seyfert 2 nuclei (for a detailed description of these models
see Carvalho et al. 2020). The temperature values predicted
by the photoionization models and considered here corre-
spond to the mean temperature for Ar2+ and S2+ over the
nebular AGN radius times the electron density. In Fig. 3,
bottom panel, the photoionization model predictions for
Te(S iii) versus Te(Ar iii) (in units of 104 K) and the ap-
proach given by Eq. 6 are shown. It can be seen that, in
contrast to H ii regions, Te(A iii) is generally higher than
Te(S iii), indicating that Eq. 6 is not valid for AGN abun-
dance studies. The same can be seen in Fig. 3, top panel,
where the AGN model predictions show a large deviation
from the temperature relation given by Eq. 7.

In order to estimate a more precise temperature to
derive the Ar2+/H+ ionic abundance, the photoionization
models by Carvalho et al. (2020) were used to obtain a rela-
tion between Te(Ar iii) and t3 as shown in Fig. 4 because t3
can be derived directly from [O iii](λ4959 + λ5007)/λ4363
observational line ratio of our sample. In Fig. 4, te(Ar iii)
corresponds to the value of Te(Ar iii) in units of 104 K. It
can be seen from Fig. 4 that there is a good correlation be-
tween the temperatures and a ﬁt to the points results in

To calculate the total argon abundance in relation to
the hydrogen (Ar/H) using only the Ar2+/H+ abundance
it is necessary to consider an ICF in order to take into ac-
count the presence of ions with other ionization levels. In
fact, ions such as Ar3+ and Ar4+ have emission lines (e.g.
[Ar iv]λ4740, [Ar v]λ7006) present in optical AGN spectra
(e.g. Koski 1978; Alloin et al. 1992). Hitherto, no ICF for
the argon abundance determinations in AGNs has been pro-
posed in the literature and, in principle, due to distinct ion-
ization structure of AGNs, theoretical ICFs proposed by H ii
regions (e.g. Mathis 1985; Izotov et al. 2006; Pérez-Montero
et al. 2007; Berg et al. 2020; Amayo et al. 2021) can not be
applied to this class of objects. In this sense, we used the
Carvalho et al. (2020) photoionization models to derive an
argon ICF, deﬁned by

ICF(Ar2+) = (Ar/H)/(Ar2+/H+)

(10)

and in terms of the function x = [O2+/(O+ + O2+)] ionic
abundance ratio. In Fig. 5 the results for ICF(Ar2+) versus
x are shown. A ﬁt to the points produces the relation

ICF(Ar+) = (a x2) + (b x) + c,

(11)

where a = 20.88 ± 3.80, b = −9.74 ± 3.64 and c = 2.68 ±
0.69. A large scattering of the points can be seen in Fig. 5.
We investigated the source of this scattering to ascertain
whether it is due to variation in the nebular parameters
Ne, αox (slope of the Spectral Energy Distribution, SED3)
and ionization parameter U (not shown). We did not ﬁnd
any dependence of these parameters with the ICF(Ar2+)-x
relation. However, a clear dependence between ICF(Ar2+)
and x on the gas metallicity is noted in Fig. 5, in the sense
that for a ﬁxed x value, we derive a higher ICF value with
the decrease of the metallicity. A dependence between the
metallicity and ICF-x relations for distinct elements was also
derived by Izotov et al. (2006) for SFs.

dicted by the photoionization models built by Carvalho et al.
(2020) by using the Cloudy code (Ferland et al. 2013). The val-
ues correspond to the model predicted mean temperature (in units
of 104 K) for each ion over the nebular AGN radius times the
electron density. Bottom panel: temperature values for the S2+
versus those for A2+. The black line corresponds to equality be-
tween the temperatures (Eq. 6) proposed by Garnett (1992) for
H ii regions. Red points represent photoionization model results.
Top panel: same as the bottom panel but for S2+ versus t3, where
t3 represents the temperature for O2+. Black line represents Eq. 7
proposed by Garnett (1992).

Figure 5. ICF for Ar2+ (as deﬁned in Eq. 10) as a function of
the x = [O2+/(O+ + O2+)] abundance ratio. Points represent re-
sults from photoionization models built by Carvalho et al. (2020).
Model results assuming diﬀerent metallicities (in relation to the
solar value) are represented by diﬀerent colours, as indicated. The
curve represents a ﬁt to all the points given by the Eq. 11.

Figure 6. Bi-parametric calibration among the ICF(Ar2+), 12 +
log(O/H) and x = [O2+/(O+ + O2+)]. Points represent the pho-
toionization model results built by Carvalho et al. (2020) while
the surfaces represent the best ﬁt to the points. The blue surface
is given by Eq. 13 and valid it is for x < 0.6 while the green
surface, given by Eq. 14, is valid for x > 0.6.

Thus, in order to obtain a more exact ICF derivation,
we produce a bi-parametric function, i.e. ICF(Ar2+) = f[12+
log(O/H), x]. We converted the metallicity (Z) assumed in
the photoionization models built by Carvalho et al. (2020)
in oxygen abundance through the expression

12 + log(O/H) = 12 + log[(Z/Z(cid:12)) × 10log(O/H)(cid:12) ],

(12)

where log(O/H)(cid:12) = −3.31 (Allende Prieto et al. 2001).
In Fig. 6 the bi-parametric calibration is shown where the
points represent the photoionization model results. We ﬁt
two functions, one for x < 0.6 represented by a blue surface
in Fig. 6 and given by

ICF(Ar2+) = (1.51 ± 0.3)x2 − (6.82 ± 1.55)y2
−(1.68 ± 0.52)xy − (27.18 ± 5.19)x

+(10.88 ± 4.72)y + 124.6 ± 22.32

(13)

where y = 12 + log(O/H) and x = [O2+/(O+ + O2+)] and
another one for x > 0.6 represented by the green surface
and given by

ICF(Ar2+) = (1.82 ± 142.29)x2 + (107.86 ± 21.07)y2

−(35.61 ± 7.13)xy − (14.54 ± 33.81)x

+(188 ± 53.96)y + 27.73 ± 142.29.

The expressions above were applied to derive the total abun-
dance of the argon in relation to the hydrogen (Ar/H).

for

the

errors

The mean

12+log(Ar/H)

and
12+log(O/H) abundances derived for
the objects of
our sample are ∼0.25 dex and ∼0.13 dex, respectively.
These errors are in order of those derived for O/H abun-
dance determinations in nearby AGNs by Revalski et al.
(2018a,b, 2021), who also applied the Te-method. However,
they are somewhat (∼ 0.1 dex) higher than those derived for
disk H ii regions located in nearby galaxies (e.g. Berg et al.

2020), because the [O iii]λ4363 auroral line is weaker in
AGNs than in H ii regions, resulting in a higher uncertainty
in its ﬂux, which in turn implies a larger uncertainty in the
AGN abundance values.

In Table 1, the SDSS identiﬁcation of the objects of the
sample, electron temperature and electron density values,
argon ICF values, ionic and total abundances, redshift, and
stellar mass of the hosting galaxies are listed.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The total argon abundance relative to hydrogen (Ar/H) in
gaseous nebulae has been derived mainly through measure-
ments of the [Ar iii]λ7135/Hβ and the assumptions consid-
ered to convert this line ratio into the Ar2+/H+ ionic abun-
dance as well as by using an expression for the ICF(Ar2+)
(e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003). In some few cases, it has been
also possible to measure the [Ar iv]λ4740 and [Ar v]λ7006
emission lines and deriving the Ar3+/H+ and Ar4+/H+
ionic abundances, respectively (e.g. Koski 1978; French 1981;
Pagomenos et al. 2018), producing a more exact Ar/H de-
termination, i.e.

Ar
H

= ICF(Ar) ×

(cid:20) Ar2+

H+ +

Ar3+
H+ +

Ar4+
H+

(cid:21)

(15)

(e.g. Wesson et al. 2005). However, the [Ar iv]λ4740 and
[Ar v]λ7006 emission lines are weak in most part of low ion-
ization objects, therefore, it is most convenient to use only
the strong [Ar iii]λ7135 (e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003; Zurita
& Bresolin 2012). In our case, the emission line measure-
ments made available by the MPA/JHU group only allowed
us to derive Ar2+/H+ ionic abundance and then apply the
ICF (Eq. 13) to obtain the total argon abundance (Ar/H).
The application of the Te-method to AGNs was recently

H ii galaxies) derived by Berg et al. (2020, 2015), Croxall et al.

proposed by Dors et al. (2020a) and the ICF for the argon,
proposed in this study, hitherto, is the ﬁrst one for this class
of objects. Thus, it is worthwhile to analyse the derived ICF
values for our sample as well as to compare it with other
proposed derivations for gaseous nebulae. In Fig. 7, bottom
panel, the distribution of the argon ICF values derived from
our sample through Eq. 13 is shown. We derived ICF val-
ues ranging from ∼ 1.8 to ∼ 3, with an averaged value of
2.38 ± 0.27. Also in Fig. 7, top panel, the argon ICF distri-
bution for 53 SFs (49 disk H ii regions and 4 H ii galaxies)
compiled from the literature is shown. We notice that ma-
jority of SFs present lower ICFs in comparison with those
derived from our sample of Seyfert 2 nuclei, implying that
∼ 90% of the SFs have ICF(Ar2+) <
∼ 2 and an average value
of about 1.5. These results point to the known fact that the
gas phase in Seyfert 2 has a higher excitation degree than
SFs.

Regarding

abundance

for
Seyfert 2 nuclei can be used to verify a possible secondary
stellar production of the argon at the very high metallicity
regime [12 + log(O/H) >
∼ 8.8], because the maximum value
derived in most part of SFs through the Te-method is in the
order of 12+log(O/H)∼ 8.7 (e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003; Berg
et al. 2020; Yates et al. 2020). In Fig. 8, the total argon abun-
dance [in units of 12+log(Ar/H)] versus the oxygen abun-
dance [in units of 12+log(O/H)] from our sample of Seyfert 2
nuclei is shown. Also in this ﬁgure, abundance results based
on Te-method for galaxy nuclei with star formation derived
by Izotov et al. (2006) (whose observational data were also
taken from SDSS; Abazajian et al. 2005) as well as results
for H ii galaxies obtained by Hägele et al. (2008) are shown.
In this case, we chose to compare our results only with those
from star-forming galaxies (excluding disk H ii regions) be-
cause SFs are subject to similar physical processes like those
in AGNs. The following are few examples which underscore
such similarities.

Figure 8. Total argon abundance [in units of 12+log(Ar/H)] ver-
sus the oxygen abundance [in units of 12+log(O/H)]. Red points
represent abundance results from our sample of Seyfert 2. Black
points represent abundance results from H ii galaxies obtained
through Te-method by Izotov et al. (2006) and Hägele et al.
(2008). The solid line represents a ﬁt to the points (Eq. 16) while
the dashed lines represent the uncertainty of ±0.1 dex in H ii
region abundance estimations (e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003).

et al. 2012; Hirschmann et al. 2013; Chisholm et al. 2017;
Riﬀel et al. 2014, 2021; Riﬀel 2021; Couto et al. 2021).

(ii) In the case of spiral galaxies the presence of bars
might produce a falling of gas into the central regions in
both objects (e.g. Athanassoula 1992).

These processes can regulate the star formation as well as
modify the gas enrichment (e.g. Oppenheimer et al. 2010;
Krumholz et al. 2017; Su et al. 2017; James et al. 2020) and
could not be present in isolated H ii regions. From Fig. 8, we
observe a clear linear relation between Ar/H and O/H indi-
cating a primary production of the argon in a wide metal-
licity regime. A ﬁt to the points (considering Seyfert 2 and
SFs) produces the expression

12+log(Ar/H) = [(0.89±0.01)×12+log(O/H)]−(1.50±0.15),

(16)

represented in Fig. 8 by a solid blue line. The dashed lines
in this ﬁgure represent the uncertainty of ±0.1 dex in abun-
dance estimations (e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003). It is notewor-
thy to point out from Fig. 8 that, for very high O/H values,
a slight deviation of the points representing AGNs results
from Eq. 16. This can be an indication of a secondary ar-
gon production at very high metallicity regime. In view of
this, we tested several polynomial ﬁttings considering dif-
ferent limits for oxygen abundance looking for a transition
from primary to secondary Ar production, but no satisfac-
tory solution was obtained. Therefore, we emphasize that
our results obtained from AGNs, when combined with those
from star-forming galaxies, indicate that the argon has a
primary stellar production in a wide metallicity range.

(i) SFs and AGNs can present gas outﬂows (e.g. Hopkins

The heavy elements in AGNs are mainly produced by

stellar evolution in the ISM located at few kpc away from
the nuclei (e.g. Boer & Schulz 1993; Elmegreen et al. 2002;
Díaz et al. 2007; Dors et al. 2008; Böker et al. 2008; Riﬀel
et al. 2009; Hägele et al. 2013; Álvarez-Álvarez et al. 2015;
Riﬀel et al. 2016; Pilyugin et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2021) and
then transported to the supermassive black hole. Additional
metal enrichment by stars can also be obtained by two ways:

(i) in situ star formation embedded in the thin AGN ac-
cretion disk (e.g. Collin & Zahn 1999; Goodman & Tan 2004;
Collin & Zahn 2008; Wang et al. 2011; Mapelli et al. 2012;
Davies & Lin 2020; Cantiello et al. 2021) and by

(ii) capture of stars orbiting the central regions of galaxies

(e.g. Syer et al. 1991; Artymowicz et al. 1993).

Both processes can produce diﬀerent chemical evolution of
AGNs in comparison with that of SFs. For instance, the max-
imum oxygen abundance in the centres of most luminous
star-forming galaxies has been found to be 12+log(O/H)∼
8.9 (e.g. Pilyugin et al. 2007) while Seyfert 2 nuclei can
reach up to ∼ 9.2 dex (e.g. Dors et al. 2020a; Dors 2021),
i.e. there is an additional enrichment in Seyferts in compar-
ison with metal rich H ii regions. Moreover, recently, Armah
et al. (2021) found that Ne/H abundance in a small sam-
ple of Seyfert 2s is nearly 2 times higher than those in SFs.
Thus, determining metal abundance in AGNs, in this case
argon abundance, can produce constraints in studies on star
nucleosynthesis in the very high metallicity regime and in
diﬀerent boundary conditions than those in SFs.

As a result, it is important to verify the range of Ar/H
abundance in AGNs, since these objects present, in general,
higher metallicity (or O/H abundance) than star-forming
regions (e.g. Groves et al. 2006; Dors et al. 2020a). In
Fig. 9, the distributions of argon abundance [in units of
12+log(Ar/H)] and log(Ar/O) for our sample and the solar
value for these abundances are shown. In Table 2 the mini-
mum, maximum and the mean abundance values, taken from
Fig. 9, as well as the oxygen abundance values (not shown
in Fig. 9) are listed. We also listed in Table 2 the minimum,
maximum and mean abundance values (Wv) in relation to
the corresponding solar value, deﬁned by

W X

v = X(v)/X(cid:12),

(17)

where X is a given abundance ratio. The solar argon and
oxygen abundances are those derived by Grevesse & Sauval
(1998) and Allende Prieto et al. (2001), respectively. It can
be inferred from Table 2 that the maximum Ar/H and Ar/O
abundance ratios in our sample of AGNs are higher than
the solar values, i.e. ∼ 2.7 and ∼ 4.0 times the solar values,
respectively. However, the W Ar/H
max. can even be
higher than the ones found in this work due to the sam-
ple considered. Actually, the W O/H
max. derived for our sam-
ple is about 1.5 times the solar value. Dors et al. (2020a)
found W O/H
max. ∼ 3.2 after considering a larger sample of SDSS
Seyfert 2 nuclei without adopting the [Ar iii] emission line
presence as a selection criterion. Thus, this disparity indi-
cates the probable existence of oversolar Ar/H and Ar/O
values higher than those listed in Table 2.

In order to compare the abundance range of Ar/H and

method for AGNs with those obtained from other methods,

dard Te-method. We extrapolated these radial gradients to
the central part of the galaxies (i.e. galactocentric distance
R = 0). This methodology makes it possible to infer indi-
rect and independent values of abundances in the nuclei of
spiral galaxies (e.g. Vila-Costas & Edmunds 1992; van Zee
et al. 1998; Pilyugin et al. 2004; Zinchenko et al. 2019). As
usual, we assume that the Ar/H and Ar/O radial abundance
gradients are represented by
Y X = Y 0
where Y X represents the value of the abundance ratio X
[12+log(Ar/H) or log(Ar/O)], Y X
0 is the extrapolated value
of X to the galactic center, i.e. at radial distance R = 0,
and grad Y X is the slope of the distribution expressed in
units of dex kpc−1. As pointed out by Pilyugin et al. (2004),
the accuracy of radial abundance gradient determinations
is deﬁned not only by the large number of objects consid-
ered but also by the distribution of these objects along the
galactic radius. Under this supposition, we take into consid-
eration published data from the literature for X abundance
values of H ii regions derived by using the Te-method and
located at galactocentric distances in spiral galaxies within
the range 0.2 <
∼ 1, where R is the galactocen-
tric distance and R25 is the B-band isophote at a surface
brightness of 25 mag arcsec−2. It was possible to obtain the
Ar/H and Ar/O radial gradients in four spiral galaxies. In
Table 3, the identiﬁcation of each galaxy, the number (N ) of
H ii regions considered in deriving the radial gradients, the

7.1 <
∼ 8.6, which correspond to the metallic-
ity range 0.03 <
∼ 0.7. This negative slope is strongly
inﬂuenced by estimations in objects with very low metallic-
ity [12 + log(O/H)] <
∼ 7.5], in which oversolar Ar/O abun-
dance values are derived. Although this result of a negative
slope is in consonance with the one found by Pérez-Montero
et al. (2007), who considered H ii galaxies and H ii regions
estimates, these authors derived solar Ar/O abundance ra-
tios for objects at low metallicity regime and subsolar values
for the ones at high metallicity regime. Finally, Berg et al.
(2020), who took into account the Te-method abundance
estimates for 190 disk H ii regions, derived sub-solar Ar/O
abundance ratio for some few H ii regions with low metallic-
ity [12+log(O/H) <
∼ 8.0]. In principle, a possible explanation
for the discrepancies above is the use of diﬀerent argon ICFs
by the authors rather than the consideration of distinct sam-
ples. In any case, it can be seen from Fig. 11 that, a slight
decrease of Ar/O with the increase of O/H, when our esti-
mates are combined with those for H ii galaxies. It is worth
to mention that, for [12 + log(O/H) >
∼ 8.0] our Ar/O esti-
mates are in consonance with those derived for H ii galaxies.
A linear regression to the points produces

4 CONCLUSIONS

rived for our sample and listed in Table 2. It can be seen that
our range of abundance estimates are in consonance with the
values obtained by independent abundance estimates from
the radial gradients. Obviously, a more exact comparison
would be obtained if both Ar/H and O/H abundances in
the AGNs and the radial abundances of these elements in
the host galaxies were determined, such as studies carried
out for the oxygen by Storchi-Bergmann et al. (1998b) and
Dors et al. (2015).

Finally, in Fig. 11, our Seyfert 2 estimates (red points)
for (Ar/O) versus (O/H) abundances and those calculated
through the Te-method for star-forming nuclei by Izotov
et al. (2006) and H ii galaxies by Hägele et al. (2008) are
shown. As for the neon and sulphur (see Dors et al. 2013,
2016 and references therein) several studies on (Ar/O) ver-
sus (O/H) have yielded conﬂicting results. For instance,
Izotov et al. (2006), by correcting the depletion of oxy-
gen onto dust grains (which is in order of ∼ 0.1 dex)

For the ﬁst time, quantitative argon abundances, based on
Te-method adapted for AGNs, is derived for the narrow
regions of Seyfert 2 nuclei. In view of this, we compiled
from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7)
optical narrow emission line ﬂuxes for 64 Seyfert 2 galax-
ies in the local universe (z < 0.25) and calculated the
abundance of the argon and oxygen in relation to hydro-
gen (Ar/H, O/H). The total argon abundance relative to
hydrogen (Ar/H) was derived for each object of the sam-
ple through the Ar2+/H+ ionic abundance and by using
a theoretical expression for the Ionization Correction Fac-
tor (ICF) obtained from photoionization model results built
with the Cloudy code. These results from the models were
also used to derive an appropriate temperature for the Ar2+
[Te(Ar iii)] which can be derived by its dependence on the
temperature for O2+ [Te(O iii)] calculated by using the ob-
servational [O iii](λ4959+λ5007)/λ4363 line ratio. We ob-
tained the following conclusions:

Te(S iii)=Te(Ar iii), usually assumed in abundance studies
of star-forming regions, is not valid for Seyfert 2 since the
nebular gas region occupied by Ar2+ tends to have a lower
temperature than the nebular gas region occupied by S2+.
