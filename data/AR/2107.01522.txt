Recent experiments have observed large anisotropic collective ﬂows in high multiplicity proton-
lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which indicates the possible formation of mini
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in small collision systems. However, no jet quenching has been conﬁrmed
in such small systems so far. To understand this intriguing result, the system size scan experiments
have been proposed to bridge the gap between large and small systems. In this work, we perform a
systematic study on both heavy and light ﬂavor jet quenching in diﬀerent collision systems at the
LHC energies. Using our state-of-the-art jet quenching model, which combines the next-to-leading-
order perturbative QCD framework, a linear Boltzmann transport model and the (3+1)-dimensional
viscous hydrodynamics simulation, we provide a good description of nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA
for charged hadrons and D mesons in central and mid-central Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions measured
by CMS collaboration. We further predict the transverse momentum and centrality dependences
of RAA for charged hadrons, D and B mesons in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions at
the LHC energies. Our numerical results show a clear system size dependence for both light and
heavy ﬂavor hadron RAA across diﬀerent collision systems. Sizable jet quenching eﬀect is obtained
for both heavy and light ﬂavor hadrons in central O+O collisions at the LHC energies. Our study
provides a signiﬁcant bridge for jet quenching from large to small systems, and should be helpful for
ﬁnding the smallest QGP droplet and the disappearance of QGP in relativistic nuclear collisions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Jet quenching and anisotropic ﬂows are the two most
important signatures of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
created in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions per-
formed at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC)
and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At low trans-
verse momentum (pT ) region, the produced ﬁnal-state
hadrons exhibit large anisotropies in the azimuthal an-
gle distribution. Such anisotropy can be successfully ex-
plained by relativistic hydrodynamics simulation [1–5],
which suggests that the produced hot and dense nu-
clear matter is a strongly-interacting QGP. The strong
interaction among QGP constituents can convert initial-
state geometric anisotropy into ﬁnal-state anisotropy of
hadron momentum distributions [6–13]. At high pT re-
gion, the ﬁnal-state hadron yields are strongly suppressed
compared to the binary-scaled nucleon-nucleon collisions.
Such phenomenon can be well explained by the energy
loss of hard jet partons during their propagation through
the soft QGP medium, and is usually called jet quench-
ing [14–19]. The interaction between jets and medium

may also lead to the modiﬁcation of jet-related correla-
tions [20–26], the suppression of full jet yields [27–37]
and the change of jet structure and substructure [38–
43]. Currently, one important task of heavy-ion physics
is to quantitatively extract various transport coeﬃcients
of the QGP and jet transport parameters using low and
high pT data [44–49], and ultimately to probe the struc-
ture and transport properties of QGP at various energy
and length scales.

In recent years, experiments have observed large
anisotropic ﬂows in proton-lead collisions at the LHC and
deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC [50–53]. The success-
fulness of relativistic hydrodynamics in explaining the
collectivity in such small systems implies the possible for-
mation of mini QGP [54–62]. However, no jet quenching
has been conﬁrmed in these small systems so far, e.g.,
RpA ≈ 1. On the other hand, the color glass condensate
framework shows that the initial-state eﬀect, i.e., the in-
teraction between partons originated from the nucleon
projectile and dense gluons inside the target nucleus be-
fore the onset of hydrodynamics evolution, can also gen-
erate signiﬁcant amount of collectivity [63–67]. Nowa-
days, how to disentangle the contributions from initial
and ﬁnal state eﬀects is still in hot debate.

In order to understand the above intriguing results,
the system size scan has been proposed to bridge the
gap between large and small collision systems [68, 69].
By scanning diﬀerent sizes of collision systems, we may
build a smooth transition from large to small collision

 
 
 
 
 
 
systems, and help to disentangle the initial and ﬁnal state
contributions. Along this line, the system size scan pre-
dictions for Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar, O+O and other
collision systems have been performed from relativistic
hydrodynamics [70, 71]. As for hard probes, there have
been studies on the nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA for
Xe+Xe collisions [72, 73] and O+O collisions [74, 75] and
the system scan study for heavy quarks and heavy ﬂavor
mesons [76]. However, a systematic study of jet quench-
ing in diﬀerent collision systems for both light and heavy
ﬂavor partons and hadrons is still lacking. This is the
main purpose of our work.

In this work, we perform a systematic study on both
heavy and light ﬂavor jet quenching in diﬀerent colli-
sion systems at the LHC energies. The productions of
jet partons and hadrons are calculated within a next-to-
leading-order perturbative QCD framework, the evolu-
tion of heavy and light ﬂavor jet partons inside the QGP
is simulated via a linear Boltzmann transport model, and
the space-time proﬁle of the QGP ﬁreball is obtained via
a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics simulation.
Using our state-of-the-art jet quenching model [77], we
obtain a nice description of RAA for charged hadrons
and D mesons in central and mid-central Pb+Pb and
Xe+Xe collisions measured by CMS collaboration. Using
the same setup, we further compute the pT and central-
ity dependences of RAA for charged hadrons, D and B
mesons in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions
at the LHC energies. Our study shows a clear system
size dependence for both light and heavy ﬂavor hadron
RAA across diﬀerent collision systems. This suggests that
RpA ≈ 1 in proton-nucleus collisions is mainly due to the
small size of the collision system. Interestingly, we ob-
serve sizable jet quenching eﬀect for both heavy and light
ﬂavor hadrons in central O+O collisions at the LHC en-
ergies, which can be tested in future experiments.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II, we
brieﬂy present the next-to-leading-order framework for
computing the momentum spectra of hard jet partons
and high pT hadron. In Section III, we provide the linear
Boltzmann transport model for describing the evolution
of jet partons interacting with the soft QGP medium. In
Section IV, we discuss the setups of the initial conditions
and hydrodynamics simulation for diﬀerent collision sys-
tems.
In Section V, we provide the numerical results
on RAA as a function of pT and centrality for charged
hadrons, D mesons, B mesons and heavy ﬂavor decayed
electrons in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions
at the LHC energies. Section VI contains our summary.

II. NLO PERTURBATIVE QCD FRAMEWORK

In this work, we use the next-to-leading-order (NLO)
perturbative QCD framework developed in Refs. [78, 79]
to calculate the production of both light and heavy ﬂavor
partons and hadrons at high transverse momentum (pT )
region. In this framework, the diﬀerential cross section

for high pT hadrons can be written as follows:

In the above equation, the sum (cid:80)
abc is over all pos-
sible partonic species. The integral ranges are set as:
zc ∈ [1 − V + V W, 1], v ∈ [V W/zc, 1 − (1 − V )/zc],
w ∈ [V W/(vzc), 1], where the hadronic variables S, T ,
U , V , W are deﬁned as:

V = 1 +

S = (pA + pB)2, T = (pA − ph)2, U = (pB − ph)2.

s = (pa + pb)2, t = (pa − pc)2, u = (pb − pc)2.

fa(xa) and fb(xb) are parton distribution functions
(PDFs), and Dh/c is fragmentation function (FF). Ne-
glecting all masses, one has the following relations:

(5)

Since the above NLO perturbative QCD framework ne-
glects all masses, it is expected to be applicable in high
pT regime, pT (cid:29) mc, mb. In this work, we focus on heavy
and light ﬂavor hadron productions at high pT (pT > 6-
8 GeV), where the fragmentation mechanism is also the
dominant contribution for hadron production. In our cal-
culation, the parton distribution functions are taken from
CTEQ parameterizations [80]. The cold nuclear matter
(CNM) eﬀects on PDFs in nucleus are taken from EPS09
parameterizations [81]. The fragmentation functions are
taken from Refs. [82–84] for charged hadrons, D mesons,
and B mesons, respectively.

In Fig. 1, we show the transverse momentum spectra
for charged hadrons, D mesons and B mesons in p+p col-
lisions. The upper two plots are charged hadron spectra
in p+p collisions at
s = 5.44 TeV,
and the lower two plots are D and B meson spectra in
p+p collisions at
s = 5.02 TeV. In the NLO pertur-
bative QCD calculation, the scales in the above equa-
tions are all taken as the transverse momenta of hadrons
µ = pT . One can see that the NLO perturbative QCD

framework can provide a nice description of both heavy
and light ﬂavor hadron production at high pT region in
nucleon-nucleon collisions, as measured by CMS collab-
oration [85–88]. This serves as the baseline to study
the hot QGP medium modiﬁcation eﬀect in high-energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions.

III. LINEAR BOLTZMANN TRANSPORT
MODEL

We use linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to
simulate the elastic and inelastic interactions between
hard partons and the soft QGP [30, 77, 89–91].
In
the LBT model, one numerically uses the Monte-Carlo
method to solve the following Boltzmann equation for
the propagating hard parton “1”:

p1 · ∂f1(x1, p1) = E1(Cel + Cinel),

(6)

where Cel and Cinel represent the collision integrals for
elastic and inelastic interactions between the hard parton
and the medium constituents.

To simulate the elastic process (1 + 2 → 3 + 4), the key

D = 6παsT 2

D)θ(u ≤ −µ2

In the above equation, γ2 is the degeneracy factor of par-
ton “2”. The condition S2(s, t, u) = θ(s ≥ 2µ2
D)θ(t ≤
−µ2
D) is imposed to avoid possible divergence
at small angle u, t → 0 [89, 92], with the Debye screening
mass taken as µ2
m, with Tm the temperature of
the QGP medium. The ± sign represents the Pauli block
and Bose enhancement eﬀects for the thermal partons.
The factor (1 − f3) is neglected in the calculation due
to the much lower density of hard partons in the QGP.
The matrix element |M12→34|2 is taken from the leading
order perturbative QCD calculation [93]. Since we only
consider the leading-order 2 → 2 scattering processes,
the distribution for the exchanged transverse momen-
tum (q⊥) between hard partons and QGP typically has a
hard tail. To account for the possible contributions from
multiple soft scatterings, we impose an eﬀective cutoﬀ
q⊥ < 10Tm for exchanged transverse momentum. Such

compensated by shifting eﬀective strong coupling αs to
a larger value. In this work, we use αs = 0.25 for the in-
teraction vertex connecting to the thermal partons inside
the medium. For the vertices connecting to jet partons,
we set αs = 4π/ (cid:2)9 ln(2E1Tm)/Λ2)(cid:3) with Λ = 0.2 GeV.
To simplify the above elastic scattering rate, we may
choose the jet parton momentum (cid:126)p1 along the +z direc-
tion and the medium parton (cid:126)p2 in the xz plane. Then
the elastic scattering rate can be obtained as follows:

where θ2 is the polar angle of the momentum (cid:126)p2, (θ4, φ4)
are the polar and azimuthal angles of the momentum (cid:126)p4,
and θ24 is the angle between (cid:126)p2 and (cid:126)p4:

cos θ24 = sin θ2 sin θ4 cos φ4 + cos θ2 cos θ4.

(9)

From energy-momentum conservation, one can ﬁnd,

E4 =

p1 · p2 + m2
4
E1 + E2 − p1 cos θ4 − p2 cos θ24

.

(10)

Using the above formula, one can calculate the elastic
scattering rate Γ(i)
for each channel and the total scat-
el
tering rate Γel = (cid:80)
i Γ(i)
el . If the number of elastic scat-
terings in a given time step ∆t follows the Poisson distri-
bution, then the probability for having elastic scatterings
in ∆t is given by:

Pel = 1 − e−Γel∆t.

(11)

For inelastic radiative process, we use the higher-twist

trum [94, 95],

where x and k⊥ are the fraction energy and transverse

(13)

The above formula naturally includes the dependences
of ˆq on jet energy and medium temperature across dif-
ferent colliding systems investigated in this work. Using
the above gluon radiation formula, one may calculate the
average gluon radiation rate in a give time step ∆t as fol-
lows:

(cid:90)

Γinel =

dxdk2

,

(14)

In this work, we impose a lower cut-oﬀ xmin = µD/E
for the emitted gluon energy to avoid the possible diver-
gence as x → 0. If the number of radiated gluons follows
a Poisson distribution, then the probability for having
inelastic scatterings in a given time step ∆t is given by:

Pinel = 1 − e−Γinel∆t.

(15)

To include both elastic and inelastic interactions, the to-
tal scattering rate is given by:

Γtot = Γel + Γinel.

(16)

The total scattering probability is then obtained as:

Ptot = 1 − e−Γtot∆t = Pel + Pinel − PelPinel.

(17)

One can split the total interaction probability into two
parts: Pel(1 − Pinel) for pure elastic scatterings and Pinel
for inelastic scatterings.

IV. HYDRODYNAMICS SIMULATION AND
INITIAL CONDITIONS

In this work, we use the (3+1)-dimensional CLVisc [96]
hydrodynamics model to simulate the space-time evo-
lution of QGP created in diﬀerent collision systems:
Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02A TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at
5.44A TeV, Ar+Ar collisions at 5.85A TeV and O+O col-
lisions at 6.5A TeV. The initial conditions for hydrody-
namics simulation are obtained as follows. The entropy
distribution S(τ0, x, y, ηs) at the initial proper time τ0 is
factorized into the entropy density s(x, y) in the trans-
verse plane and the longitudinal envelop function H(ηs),

S(τ0, x, y, ηs) = Ks(x, y)H(ηs),

(18)

where K is an overall normalization factor which is ad-
justed to describe the charged hadron spectra in the
most central collisions [97, 98]. For Ar-Ar and O-O

collisions at the LHC energies, where the experimental
data on multiplicity are unavailable, we use the empir-
ical power-law formula: 2/(cid:104)Npart(cid:105) (cid:104)dNch/dη(cid:105) ||η|<0.5 =
0.7455(sNN/GeV2)0.1538 [98], which is ﬁtted to the multi-
plicity data of RHIC Au+Au and LHC Pb+Pb collisions
at various colliding energies. The entropy density s(x, y)
in the transverse plane is generated from the TRENTo
model[99], in which the positions of nucleons in nucleus
are sampled according to the following Woods-Saxon dis-
tribution:

ρ(r, θ) = ρ0

1 + w r2

R2(θ)
(cid:16) r−R(θ)

(19)

where ρ0 denotes the nuclear density at the center, d is
a surface thickness parameter, the radius parameter

R(θ) = R0[1 + β2Y20(θ) + β4Y40(θ)],

(20)

with Ynl(θ) being the spherical harmonic functions,
and (w, β2, β4) controlling the deviations from spherical
shape. Table.(I) shows the parameters used the Woods-
Saxon distribution for diﬀerent collision systems.

Using the Glauber model simulation, one may calculate

assigning each participant nucleon a Gaussian smearing
function (with width 0.5 fm). Then the local entropy
density s(x, y) is constructed from the thickness function

In this work, we choose the parameter p = 0 which mim-

taken from the s95-pce parameterization. After hydrody-
namic evolution, the QGP medium will be converted to
hadrons according to the Cooper-Frye formula where the
switching temperature is taken as Tsw = 137 MeV. Note
that the soft hadrons produced from the freezeout hy-
persurface of the ﬂuid have negligible contribution to the
nuclear modiﬁcation of hard hadrons with pT > 6−8 GeV
explored in this paper [100].

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In Fig. 2, we show the nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA
as a function of transverse momentum pT for charged
hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02A TeV, Xe+Xe col-
lisions at 5.44A TeV, Ar+Ar collisions at 5.85A TeV
and O+O collisions at 6.5A TeV at the LHC. Four pan-
els show four diﬀerent centralities: 0-10%, 10-30%, 30-
50% and 50-80%. The bands show the uncertainties
due to the cold nuclear matter eﬀect: solid/dashed/dash-
dotted/dash-dot-dotted curves represent our calculation
results with CNM while dotted curves are correspond-
ing results without CNM. Note that as there is no nu-
clear PDF for 40Ar from EPS09 parameterizations, we
take the nuclear PDF of 40Ca as an approximation in
the calculation. We have checked that for Pb+Pb colli-
sions, the use of the impact parameter dependent nPDF
– EPS09s [103] makes the CNM uncertainty band of RAA
narrower in peripheral collisions, but has small eﬀect in
central collisions. One possible reason is that central col-
lisions have much larger binary collision number than
peripheral collisions, thus have much larger contribution

model can provide a very good description of the trans-
verse momentum and centrality dependences of RAA for

charged hadrons in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions as mea-
sured by CMS Collaboration. Using the same setups,
we predict charged hadron RAA for smaller collision sys-
tems, such as Ar+Ar and O+O collisions, as a function
of pT and centrality. One can clearly see the system size

dependence for RAA, i.e., RAA is larger for smaller sys-
tems, due to smaller jet energy loss eﬀect. The system
size dependence can also been seen from the centrality
dependence: RAA becomes closer to unity when moving
from central to peripheral collisions.

It is very interesting to see that the jet quenching ef-

fect on RAA is still very signiﬁcant in central O+O colli-
sions: RAA at pT ∼ 8-10 GeV can reach about 0.5. Such
quenching eﬀect should be large enough to be observed
in the future O+O collisions at the LHC. The conﬁrma-
tion of our result in the future can serve as the bridge
to search for the QGP signal in even smaller collision

systems like proton-nucleus collisions. It is worth noting
that the experimental bias in event selection may lead to
sizable deviation from unity for RAA in peripheral colli-
sions [104, 105].

In order to see the system size dependence more clearly,
we plot in Fig. 3 the nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA as
a function of Npart for four diﬀerent collision systems (as

shown by four diﬀerent curves). The left ﬁgure shows
the result for pT = (6.7, 7.7) GeV and the right ﬁgure for
pT = (26, 30) GeV. Our model can describe the experi-
mental data for Pb+Pb collisions and Xe+Xe collisions
quite well. One now sees that RAA is a decreasing func-
tion of Npart, which clearly demonstrates the system size
eﬀect on the jet energy loss and nuclear modiﬁcation fac-

tor RAA. As one goes from larger to smaller collision sys-
tems, RAA increases and tends to reach unity. One also
observes that for the same values of Npart, there exist
some diﬀerences in RAA from four diﬀerent collision sys-
tems due to diﬀerent collision energies. We have checked
that the eﬀect of the diﬀerent initial parton spectra is
negligible (as the collision energies are not very diﬀerent).
This means that diﬀerent initial geometries and hydro-
dynamic evolution proﬁles play more important roles for
such diﬀerence.

In Fig. 4, we show RAA of D mesons as a function
of pT for Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions
at the LHC energies. The setup is the same as Fig. 2.
Four diﬀerent centralities (0-10%, 10-30%, 30-50% and
50-80%) are shown. One can see that our model can
can also describe D meson RAA as a function of pT and
centrality for Pb+Pb collisions as measured by ALICE
and CMS Collaborations. This means that the ﬂavor,
energy and system size dependences of jet quenching can
be well understood in our jet quenching model. Using the
same setups, the predictions for smaller collision systems
(Ar+Ar and O+O collisions) are shown. We can see that
the jet quenching eﬀect on D meson RAA is also quite

signiﬁcant in central O+O collisions.

In Fig. 5, we show RAA of D mesons as a function
of Npart in four collision systems for two pT bins: pT =
(6.7, 7.7) GeV in the left panel and pT = (26, 30) GeV on
the right. Similar to charged hadron RAA, D meson RAA
is also a decreasing function of Npart, which clearly shows
that jet quenching eﬀect becomes weaker for smaller sys-
tem sizes.

Figure 6 shows B meson RAA as a function of pT for
four diﬀerent collision centralities (0-10%, 10-30%, 30-
50% and 50-80%) in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O
collisions at the LHC energies. One can see that due to
larger masses of b quarks, the values of B meson RAA are
larger than D meson and charged hadron RAA. We can
see that even for B mesons, jet quenching eﬀect on RAA is
still sizable in central O+O collisions. Figure 7 shows B
meson RAA as a function of Npart in four collision systems
for pT = (6.7, 7.7) GeV (Left) and pT = (26, 30) GeV
(Right). Similar system size (Npart) dependence can be
seen for B meson RAA. Our results on the ﬂavor, mass,
energy and system size dependences of jet quenching can
be tested by future measurements.

Recently, experiments have also measured the nuclear

trons. Using the same setups, we further calculate RAA
for electrons decayed from D and B mesons for central
0-10%, 10-30%, 30-50% and 50-80% Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe,
Ar+Ar and O+O collisions at the LHC energies, as
shown in Fig. 8. One can see that our model can also de-
scribe the heavy ﬂavor decayed electron RAA in Pb+Pb
collisions at 5.02A TeV measured by ALICE Collabora-
tion.
In addition, we also observe similar system size
dependence for heavy ﬂavor decayed electron RAA.

VI. SUMMARY

Using our state-of-the-art jet quenching model, we
have performed a systematic study on heavy and light
ﬂavor jet quenching in diﬀerent collision systems at the
LHC energies. The momentum spectra of light and heavy
ﬂavor hadrons at high pT are calculated within a next-
to-leading-order perturbative QCD framework, by tak-
ing into account both quark and gluon contributions
to high pT light and heavy ﬂavor hadron productions.
The evolution and energy loss of light and heavy par-
tons in the QGP is simulated via the linear Boltzmann
transport (LBT) model. The space-time evolution of the
QGP ﬁreball is simulated using a (3+1)-dimensional vis-
cous hydrodynamics. Using our jet quenching model,
we have calculated the nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAA
for charged hadrons, D mesons, B mesons and heavy-
ﬂavor decayed electrons as a function of pT and cen-
trality (Npart) for central 0-10%, 10-30%, 30-50% and
50-80% Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions at
the LHC energies. Our model can give a good descrip-
tion of charged hadron, D meson and heavy ﬂavor de-
cayed electron RAA’s in central and mid-central Pb+Pb
(and Xe+Xe) collisions measured by CMS and ALICE

10

Collaborations. We have also provided the detailed pre-
dictions for the transverse momentum and centrality de-
pendences of RAA’s for charged hadrons, D meson, B
mesons, and heavy ﬂavor decayed electrons in Pb+Pb,
Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions at the LHC energies.
Our results show that both light and heavy ﬂavor RAA’s
have a strong system size dependence. As the system size
becomes smaller, jet quenching eﬀect on RAA diminishes:
RAA tends to approach unity as the system size shrinks.
Our result indicates that RpA ≈ 1 in proton-nucleus col-
lisions is mainly due to the small size of the nuclear
medium produced in the collisions. Very interestingly,
our calculation also show signiﬁcant jet quenching eﬀect
on RAA’s for charged hadrons and heavy ﬂavor hadrons
and their decayed electrons in central O+O collisions at
the LHC energies, which can be tested by future exper-
iments.
In summary, our study provides an important
baseline for studying the ﬂavor, mass, energy and system
size dependences of jet quenching. Further studies along
this line should help to identify the unique signatures of
mini QGP droplet and search for the disappearance of
QGP by scanning the system size and collision energy of
relativistic nuclear collisions.
