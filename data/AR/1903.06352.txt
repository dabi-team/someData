interchange reconnection

ABSTRACT

The emergence of active regions (ARs) leads to various dynamic activities.
Using high-resolution and long-lasting Hα observations from the New Vacuum So-
lar Telescope, we report the dynamics of NOAA AR 12700 in its emerging phase
on 26 February 2018 in detail. In this AR, constant interchange reconnections
between emerging ﬁbrils and preexisting ones were detected. Driven by the ﬂux
emergence, small-scale ﬁbrils observed in Hα wavelength continuously emerged at
the center of the AR and reconnected with the ambient preexisting ﬁbrils, forming
new longer ﬁbrils. We investigate three scenarios of such interchange reconnec-
tion in two hours. Specially, the third scenario of reconnection resulted in the
formation of longer ﬁbrils that show pronounced rotation motion. To derive the
evolution of the magnetic structure during the reconnections, we perform nonlin-
ear force-free ﬁeld extrapolations. The extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic
ﬁelds clearly depict a set of almost potential emerging loops, two preexisting ﬂux
ropes at 03:00 UT before the second reconnection scenario, and a set of newly
formed loops with less twist at 03:48 UT after the third reconnection scenario.
All of these extrapolated structures are consistent with the ﬁbrils detected in Hα
wavelength. The aforementioned observations and extrapolation results suggest
that the constant interchange reconnections resulted in that the magnetic twist
was redistributed from preexisting ﬂux ropes towards the newly-formed system
with longer magnetic structure and weaker twist.

Introduction

The emergence of active regions (ARs) is of fundamental importance in solar physics.
Observations of how ARs emerge reveal the transport processes that bring magnetic ﬁelds to
the solar atmosphere. The emergence of ARs is a multi-stage process (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015). Initially, toroidal magnetic ﬁelds are generated close to the base of the convection
zone. Then, presumably triggered by deep convective ﬂows and buoyant instabilities, mag-
netic ﬂux tubes rise towards the surface as Ω-shaped loops, break through it, and leave
footprints in the forms of sunspots and plages (Zwaan 1987; Moreno-Insertis 1997, 2007;
Fan 2009a). The evolution of emerging ﬂux tubes from below the solar surface to the
corona is associated with various phenomena such as moving magnetic features (MMF;
Zhang & Wang 2002; Zhang et al. 2003), plages, Ellerman bombs (EBs; Nelson et al. 2013),
arch ﬁlament system (AFS), micro-pores (Gonz´alez Manrique et al. 2017), rotational bipoles
(Fan 2009b; Kumar et al. 2013), and jets/surges (Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2014). The re-
lationships between the aforementioned phenomena and ﬂux emergence are shown in the
review of Schmieder et al. (2014). Recent high-resolution observations of small-scale emer-
gence events give insight to how ARs appear on the solar surface. Otsuji et al. (2011) studied
the nature of ﬂux emergence with Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007)/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT;
Tsuneta et al. 2008) data. Centeno (2012) presented the naked emergence of ARs observed
by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).

The emergence of ARs leads to various dynamic activities. Observations and numerical
simulations have shown that the interaction of newly emerging magnetic ﬂux with pre-
existing magnetic ﬁelds leads to coronal heating (Shibata et al. 1991; Moore et al. 2002;
Pevtsov & Kazachenko 2004; Galsgaard & Parnell 2005) and redistribution of helicity (Zhang & Low
2001, 2003). When magnetic ﬂux emerges from beneath the photosphere, it may reconnect
with the preexisting ﬁelds.
Interchange is one model of reconnection, which often occurs
between closed and open ﬂuxes (Crooker et al. 2002). Here we deﬁne the interchange re-
connection (IR) as a process that two sets of magnetic loops interact with each other and
interchange their footpoints. Observational evidences supportive of IR between emerging
active region and coronal hole (CH) include corona dimming (Baker et al. 2007) and the
retreat of the CH boundary (Kong et al. 2018). Li et al. (2014) reported the detailed inter-
change reconnection process as a way to convert mutual helicity to self-helicity by employing
observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014).

Numerical simulations of AR emergence bring insight into the magnetic and dynamic
properties of the emergence process. Recent three-dimensional (3D) megnetohydrodynam-
ics (MHD) simulations are able to produce an AR based on diﬀerent emergence conditions
(Archontis & Hood 2012; Rempel & Cheung 2014; Toriumi et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017 and

– 3 –

references therein). It is noteworthy that, the model of Cheung et al. (2010) has rather suc-
cessfully explained some observational properties associated with ARs emergence, including
elongated granules, mixed polarity patterns in the emergence zone, pore formation, and light
bridges. In addition, ﬂux-emergence experiments often see the magnetic reconnection be-
tween emerging magnetic ﬂux and the preexisting ambient ﬁelds. Edmondson et al. (2010)
investigated the eﬀect of IR on the dynamics and topology of coronal hole boundaries. Based
on 3D MHD calculations, Edmondson (2012) argued that IR plays a deﬁning role in the evo-
lution of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, and therefore the generation of the slow solar wind.

Despite preexisting MHD models for explaining AR emergence, observational evidences
of the detailed emergence process have rarely been reported. Previous studies focused more
on photospheric layer and coronal response of the emergence events. Okamoto et al. (2009)
reported the emergence of a ﬂux rope at the polarity inversion line (PIL) in AR 10953, which
was controversial. MacTaggart & Hood (2010) constructed a dynamic ﬂux emergence model
and found that the signatures of Okamoto et al. (2009) are not suﬃcient to uniquely identify
an emerging ﬂux rope. Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. (2012) argued that the emergence of the ﬂux
rope did not take place at the PIL. Yan et al. (2017) observed a small-scale emerging ﬂux
rope near a large sunspot and the entire process from its emergence to eruption by Big Bear
Solar Observatory (BBSO)/Goode Solar Telescope (GST; Goode & Cao 2012). In addition,
limited by the low resolution of previous observations, distinct detections of interchange
reconnection in the emerging ARs are rare. In the present work, using the high-resolution
and long-lasting Hα observations acquired at the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST;
Liu et al. 2014) and the simultaneous observations from the SDO, we present the detailed
processes of three scenarios of interchange reconnection in AR 12700 on 26 February 2018.
It is noteworthy that the Hα observations we adopted last for 5 hours, covering the early
emerging phase of AR 12700. These observations provide a complete view of IR, as they cover
all the atmospheric layers from the photosphere to the corona at high temporal and spatial
resolution. In particular, the Hα observations clearly depict the emergence of ﬂux tubes,
and rotational motion of ﬁbrils which are formed via reconnection between the emerging ﬂux
tubes and the preexisting ﬁbrils. Moreover, the results derived from the nonlinear force-free
ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolations are consistent with the observations, providing more details
on the changes of magnetic structures during the IRs.

Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the observations and data analysis
taken in our study. In Section 3, we investigate three scenarios of IR between emerging ﬂux
and preexisting ﬁeld in great detail. Finally, we summarize the major ﬁndings and discuss
the results in Section 4.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

On 26 February 2018, NOAA AR 12700 emerged with β−conﬁguration at solar disk
location N04W01. The NVST was pointed at this region on 26 February, and one series of
Hα 6562.8 ˚A observations were taken from 02:01:00 UT to 06:56:00 UT with a cadence of 8
s, a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 152′′ × 151′′, and a spatial sampling of 0.′′136 pixel−1. These Hα
observations clearly reveal the detailed emergence process in chromosphere, including ﬁbrils
emergence, interactions between diﬀerent groups of ﬁbrils, and untwisting motion of ﬁbrils.

Moreover, we have also analyzed the data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) on board the SDO to ﬁgure out the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolution and coronal
response during the emergence of AR 12700. The HMI data adopted here were obtained from
2018 February 25 to 26, with a cadence of 45 s and a pixel size of 0.′′5. The AIA provides
successive full-disk images of the multi-layered solar atmosphere with ten passbands, seven
of which are in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channel and observed with a cadence of 12 s and
a pixel size of 0.′′6. Here we focus on the 171 ˚A wavelength, which manifests the coronal
brightenings clearly. All the data are calibrated with standard solar software routines, and
all images observed by the SDO are diﬀerentially rotated to a reference time (04:00:00 UT on
26 February). Moreover, data from all telescopes and instruments are carefully co-aligned,
and the region of interest (ROI) is spatially and temporally extracted from the diﬀerent
channels.

In order to investigate the evolution of the magnetic structures during the reconnections,
we perform NLFFF extrapolations at 03:00 UT and 03:48 UT on 26 February with HMI
photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds as the boundary condition. The extrapolations use the
“weighted optimization” method (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012). The vector
magnetograms are preprocessed by a procedure developed by Wiegelmann et al. (2006) to
remove the force and noise. Both NLFFF extrapolations are performed in a box of 288 ×
168 × 256 uniformly spaced grid points (104 × 61 × 93 Mm3).

3. Results

AR 12700 emerged near the center of the solar disk on 26 February 2018 , which is
shown in Figure 1. Prior to the NVST Hα observations, sequence of HMI magnetograms
show remarkable rotation of magnetic patches and separation of the ﬁelds with opposite
polarities in this AR. At 22:04:10 UT on 25 February, the negative patch denoted by white
contour in Figure 1(a) owned an elongated shape and a 19◦ angle between its main axis

– 5 –

and the horizontal direction. Then, the elongated patch rotated anticlockwise, increasing
the angle up to 166◦ at 00:55:55 UT on 26 February. The mean rotating speed was about
0.85◦ min−1.
In addition, a bipole (marked by the white brackets in panel (b)) emerged
at 23:05:40 UT on 25 February and its positive patch (denoted by the red triangle) shifted
northeastward with a velocity of 0.5 km s−1 in the following one hour.

The Hα observations reveal that constant interchange reconnections occurred in the
central region of AR 12700, which is approximately outlined by the blue dashed rectangle in
Figure 1(a) and extended in Figures 2-5. From 02:00 UT to 04:00 UT on 26 February, three
scenarios of IR were detected occurring between the emerging ﬁbrils and the preexisting ones.
Figure 2 (also see animation 1) shows the ﬁrst scenario of reconnection which occurred from
02:12 UT to 02:32 UT. The Hα observations (panels (a1)-(a3)) clearly show that two groups
of chromospheric ﬁbrils, i.e., preexisting ﬁbrils (PF) and emerging ﬁbrils (EF), successively
interacted with each other from 02:24 UT to 02:30 UT. As a result, a new group of ﬁbrils
(NF) were formed (see panel (a3)). The corresponding HMI magnetograms reveal that EF
and PF were rooted in magnetic ﬁelds with opposite polarities, the southwest footpoint of EF
was rooted in the main negative polarity of the AR and its northeast footpoint was located
in the positive ﬁelds emerging between the main polarities. After interaction, the west leg
of NF was close to the EF’s southwest footpoint and its east leg was close to PF’s northeast
footpoint (see panels (b) and (d)). It is consistent with the condition of IR. Moreover, AIA
171 ˚A observations revealed brightenings appearing at the intersection of PF and EF, and
lasting from 02:21 UT to 02:32 UT, which further implies that the IR occurred between EF
and PF.

In Figure 3 (also see animation 2), the second reconnection scenario is displayed, which
occurred from 03:00 UT to 03:17 UT. At 03:02:09 UT, there were three groups of chromo-
spheric ﬁbrils: small-scale emerging ﬁbrils (EF: EF1 and EF2) and two groups of preexisting
ﬁbrils (PF1 and PF2). The magnetic connections of EF and PF1 (see panel (b1)) here are
similar to that shown in Figure 2(b). The western legs of EF and PF1 were rooted in the
main negative polarity of AR 12700. Interactions between EF and PF1 started at 03:02 UT,
continued for about 15 minutes, and then a new group of ﬁbrils (NF1) were formed. As
shown in panel (b2), NF1 connected two main polarities of the AR, with its west leg close
to EF’s southwest footpoint and its east leg close to PF1’s northeast footpoint. The changes
of the magnetic connections of these two groups of ﬁbrils are representative IR signatures.

Figure 4 displays the emergence of the small-scale ﬁbrils and its associated thermal
properties at the onset of the second reconnection. The newly emerging ﬁbrils were clearly
observed at 03:03 UT (see panel (b2)). During the EF emergence, brightening in 171 ˚A chan-
nel appeared in EF, the west footpoint of PF1, and the intersections of PF1 and EF, lasting

– 6 –

from 03:03 UT to 03:06 UT. Note that the brightenings were ﬁrst observed in north part of
EF and then in the south part (see panels (a1)-(a4)). To investigate the detailed process
of the EF emergence, we make time slices (panels (c1)-(c2)) in Hα channel along vertical
cut “A-B” and slit “C-D” shown in panel (b1). Panel (c1) shows that EF initially rose at a
projected velocity of 13 km s−1, which is comparable to the previous studies (Chou & Zirin
1988; Cheung & Isobe 2014). EF’s rising projected height was 1.5 Mm. At 03:03 UT, Hα
brightenings began appearing at the two sides of EF. The light curve of Hα superposed in
panel (c2) shows that the average emission strength peaked around 03:05:30 UT. Signiﬁcant
brightenings in Hα channel and EUV channels at the interaction sites between EF and PF1
indicate the occurence of reconnection.

The third reconnection is shown in Figure 5 (also see animation 2). From 03:18 UT
to 03:34 UT, PF2 was split into two groups, one group interacted with EF and led to the
formation of new longer ﬁbrils similar to NF1 which showed a pronounced rotation motion
from 03:24 UT to 03:33 UT. Note that the rotation originated from the intersection between
EF and PF2. At 03:34 UT, the southernmost part of EF was lifted and interacted with the
other group of PF2, leading to the formation of another group of ﬁbrils. As a result, several
groups of newly-formed longer ﬁbrils (NFs) are produced to connect the main polarities after
the constant reconnections. Meanwhile, brightenings (denoted by the green contour and
arrows) in 171 ˚A channel appeared in the intersections of diﬀerent groups of ﬁbrils, peaked
around 03:31 UT (panel (b2)), and lasted from 03:27 UT to 03:39 UT. The corresponding
HMI magnetograms (panel (c)) shows that the footpoints of NFs were anchored in the
locations of the EF’s negative footpoint and PF2’s positive footpoint, suggesting the magnetic
connections are consistent with IR model.

Based on the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds at 03:00 UT and 03:48 UT, we ex-
trapolate the 3D structure of the target AR by using NLFFF modelling. For visualizations
of the emerging ﬁbrils and preexisting ones in the second and third reconnection scenarios
mentioned above, we select a region with the FOV similar to Figure 1 from the NLFFF
extrapolations and display the results in Figure 6. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the extrap-
olation results at 03:00 UT from the top view and side view, respectively. The emerging
loops (EL) were overlaid by two magnetic ﬂux ropes (FR1 and FR2). The north part of EL
(EL(N)) is higher than its south part (EL(S)). At 03:48 UT, a set of longer loops (NL) with
weak twist were formed. The modelling results are consistent with the observations shown
in Figures 3–5, for that EL(N), EL(S), FR1, FR2, and NL here is corresponding well to EF1,
EF2, PF1, PF2, and NFs in Hα images, respectively. In addition, the extrapolations show
that the twist angle of FR1, FR2 is about 2π and 4π, respectively.

4. Summary and Discussion

In this paper, we study the dynamics of AR 12700 in its emerging phase on 26 February
by using observations from the NVST and SDO. The photospheric evolution of the emerging
AR is characterized by the rotation of magnetic patches and separation of emerging bipoles.
Driven by the ﬂux emergence, IR between emerging ﬂux and preexisting ﬁelds constantly
occurred in the upper atmosphere in AR 12700. At the centre of this AR, we investigate three
such processes that small-scale emerging ﬁbrils reconnect with the overlying preexisting ones,
accompanied by Hα and EUV brightening, ﬁnally forming new groups of ﬁbrils. Specially,
during the third reconnection scenario, the formation of longer ﬁbrils via reconnection shows
remarkable rotation motion. Besides, the extrapolated 3D ﬁelds clearly depict the small-scale
emerging loops, two overlying ﬂux ropes, and the newly-formed loops. They coincide well
with the observed emerging ﬁbrils, two groups of preexisting ﬁbrils, and the newly-formed
longer ﬁbrils, respectively.

The emergence of ARs is associated with various dynamic activities, such as jets and

ﬂares which are triggered by reconnections (Shibata et al. 2007; Schmieder et al. 2013; Aulanier
2014). During the emergence of AR 12700, we detect IRs and surge-like activities. Surge-
like activities will be investigated in another upcoming paper. In the present work, three
processes of IRs are investigated in detail. We conﬁrm these reconnections are IR for the
solid evidences as follows: (1) distinct interactions between constant emerging ﬁbrils and
preexisting ﬁbrils, (2) brightenings in Hα and EUV wavelengths at their intersections, and
(3) the newly-formed longer ﬁbrils due to the interactions between two groups of Hα ﬁbrils
that show changes of magnetic connections.

The NLFFF modelling reveals that EL is almost potential, with its north part (EL(N))
higher than its south part (EL(S)). This coincides well with the observations shown in Figures
4(a1)-(a4), that is, brightenings in 171 ˚A channel ﬁrst appeared in north part of EF and then
in the south part of EF. Considering the extrapolation results and Figures 3-4, we suggest
that PF1 ﬁrstly reconnected with EF1, which was higher and closer to PF1 at 03:00 UT,
and then reconnected with EF2, which rose up to the height of PF1 at 03:03:33 UT. As
shown in Figures 6(c)-(d) and animation 2, the third reconnection scenario ﬁnally resulted
in the formation of the twisted structure NL with weaker twist than FR1 and FR2. Similar
observations have been reported by Xue et al. (2016). They investigated the rotational
motion of the erupted ﬁlament enabled by the reconnection with the chromospheric ﬁbrils
and proposed that the reconnection between the ﬁlaments and less twisted ﬂux leads to the
release of twist. Using BBSO/GST, Kumar et al. (2017) found that reconnection of cool
loops caused the formation of an unstable ﬂux rope that showed counterclockwise rotation,
which was driven by the rapid ﬂux cancellation in decaying phase of AR 12353. However, in

– 8 –

our case, the reconnections were driven by ﬂux emergence in AR emerging phase.

According to the twisted threads of NL shown in Figures 6(c)-(d), we estimate its twist
angle is less than 2π. As mentioned above, the twist angle of FR2 is about 4π. These
extrapolation results suggest that the IR between potential emerging ﬂux and preexisting
ﬂux ropes resulted in that the magnetic twist was redistributed from the preexisting ﬂux
ropes to the newly-formed system with longer magnetic structure and weaker twist. As
magnetic ﬂux emergence going on, the reconnections reconﬁgure the magnetic ﬁelds within
the AR, and redistribute the magnetic twist. Similar scenarios have been proposed by
Pevtsov et al. (1996) and Canﬁeld & Reardon (1998) with data of about 1′′ pixel size. In
the present work, the observations with a 0.′′136 pixel size enable us to identify the details
throughout the reconnection process. The result revealed in our work is diﬀerent from
the previous emerging-reconnection picture that the emerging ﬁelds are twisted and then
the twist is transported to the newly formed structure via reconnection with the potential
overlying preexisting ﬁelds (Pevtsov et al. 2003; Fan & Gibson 2004). According to the
work of Xue et al. (2016), when ﬁlaments reconnect with less twisted ﬂux, the twist tends
to equilibrate along the new structure, resulting from a true propagation of twist from the
more twisted to the less twisted part (as a torsional Alfv´en wave packet). During the third
reconnection scenario in our work, reconnections between FR2 with twist angle of 4π and
the potential ﬂux result in NL whose twist angle is less than 2π. Such process of twist
propagation presents as an rotational motion of the newly-formed longer ﬁbrils.

Fig. 1.— Sequence of SDO/HMI magnetograms displaying the evolution of AR 12700 from
22:00 UT on 25 February to 01:00 UT on 26 February 2018. The white contours outline the
magnetic patch with negative polarity, which shows obvious rotation motion. The green solid
line shows the axis of this patch, the yellow dashed line represents the horizonal direction,
and the angle between them is α. The blue dashed rectangle approximates the FOV of
Figures 2-5. The white square brackets in panel (b) highlight a newly-emerging bipole, and
the red triangle marks the positive magnetic element of the bipole. Triangles in panel (c) play
the same role, with the red one indicating the present location and the blue one indicating
the previous location in panel (b).

Fig. 2.— The ﬁrst scenario of interchange reconnection between emerging ﬁbrils and preex-
isting ones observed from 02:12 UT to 02:31 UT on 26 February. Panels (a1)-(a3): NVST Hα
images displaying the scenes before, during, and after the reconnection. The blue and red
curves indicate the preexisting ﬁbrils (PF) and the newly-emerging small ones (EF), which
are duplicated in panel (b). The yellow curve indicates the newly-formed ﬁbrils (NF) re-
sulting from the reconnection, which is overplotted on panel (d). Panels (b)-(d): SDO/HMI
magnetograms and AIA 171 ˚A image corresponding to the top panels. The green contours
mark the locations of AIA 171 ˚A brightenings, which are overplotted on panels (a1)-(a2).
Online animation (movie1.mov) displays NVST Hα and SDO/AIA 171 ˚A images shown in
Figure 2. The 10s animation covers 29 minutes from 02:05 UT to 02:34 UT on 26 February
2018.

Fig. 4.— Characteristics of the emergence of the small-scale ﬁbrils during the second re-
connection scenario. Panels (a1)-(a4): Brightenings in 171 ˚A wavelength during the EF
emergence. The red arrows denote the EF brightenings that appeared successively. The
blue arrows denote the brightening around footpoints of PF1. Panels (b1)-(b2): NVST Hα
images acquired before and at the onset of Hα brightenings. The blue and red curves delin-
eate the preexisting ﬁbrils (PF1) and the emerging ones (EF), respectively. Panels (c1)-(c2):
Time-slice plots in Hα wavelength along vertical cut “A-B” and slit “C-D” marked in panel
(b1), respectively. The white dash-dotted lines mark the onset of the Hα brightening. The
yellow arrows denote the brightenings in Hα wavelength. The red curve is the light curve
displaying the variation of the average emission intensity in Hα wavelength in slit “C-D”.

Fig. 6.— Magnetic structures revealed by the NLFFF extrapolations before the second
reconnection scenario (panels (a)-(b)) and after the third reconnection scenario (panels (c)-
(d)). The photospheric vertical magnetograms (Bz) is shown as the background. The ﬁst
row is the top view of the structure, with north is up and west to the right. The second
row is the side view. The red curves in panels (a)-(b) represent the emerging loops (EL),
whose noth part (EL(N)) is higher and south part (EL(S)) is lower. The two set of green
curves represent two magnetic ﬂux ropes (FR1 and FR2). The green curves in panels (c)-(d)
represent the newly-formed twisted loops (NL) resulting from the reconnection.
