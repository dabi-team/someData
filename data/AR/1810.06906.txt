We present an analysis of the appearance of the Cooper Minimum in singly ionized argon in
both the photoionization cross-section (PICS) and high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectrum. We
employ two computational approaches based on the same R-matrix technique to provide a coherent
description of the atomic structure of the Ar+ system, ﬁnding that the PICS and HHG spectrum are
aﬀected diﬀerently by the inclusion of additional residual ion states and the improved description
of correlation eﬀects. Both the PICS and HHG spectrum possess a clear minimum for all atomic
structure models used, with the centre of the minimum at 55 eV in the PICS and 60 eV in the
HHG spectrum for the most complete description employed. The HHG minimum is systematically
shifted to higher energies with respect to the PICS minimum. We also ﬁnd that the initial magnetic
alignment (magnetic quantum number) of the Ar+ system does not aﬀect substantially the position
and shape of the HHG minimum (given a suﬃciently detailed atomic structure description), but the
harmonic yield is enhanced by two-orders of magnitude for ML = 1 over ML = 0. We also perform
similar calculations for neutral argon, ﬁnding that this system is more sensitive to enhancements in
the atomic structure description.

INTRODUCTION

Attosecond physics provides a key window on the fun-
damental dynamics of atoms [1] and, via the uncer-
tainty relationships, these dynamics are complimentary
to atomic structure. This complementarity has recently
been investigated in the build up of Fano resonances [2],
but is present in other processes. High-harmonic genera-
tion (HHG) has long been established as both the source
of ultrashort light pulses [3] and a valuable measurement
tool in the guise of high-harmonic spectroscopy [4]. The
dynamic HHG process depends on a well-timed photoab-
sorption process in a short laser pulse. This can be con-
trasted with a structure-based photoionization process,
which involves light pulses eﬀectively inﬁnite in extent.
The HHG process has been well described for decades
using the simple-man model: an electron is ionized and
accelerated by a strong laser ﬁeld before recolliding with
its parent ion and emitting its absorbed energy as a high-
energy photon [5]. The simple-man model provides an
intuitive classical picture for the process, and describes
the gross features of the resulting spectrum of emitted
light well, but fails to capture atomic-structure or multi-
electron eﬀects [6].

This is particularly troublesome because probing
atomic resonances with strong-ﬁelds has long been a vital
function in attosecond physics [6–9]. Certain resonances
have been shown to increase the yield of harmonic emis-
sion, either in a broad energy range (e.g via the giant
resonance in xenon [6, 10]) or at the speciﬁc frequencies
of the resonances (e.g. via the window resonances in ar-
gon [11, 12]) providing important eﬃciency gains toward
attosecond pulse generation.

We have shown previously that HHG at the single-
atom level is crucially sensitive to the details of atomic
structure of the target system [13, 14] and to the contri-
bution of multiple electrons [15, 16]. One means of ad-
dressing the description of multielectron dynamics is to
extend traditional methods– based on the single-active-
electron approximation– to account for electron correla-
tion via correction terms. Recent attempts at developing
such models are strongly suggestive of the crucial role
played by multielectron dynamics in determining HHG
emission rates, but are unable to provide a quantitative
description of HHG yields [17].

The need for an accurate, quantitative description
of HHG from rare gas atoms and ions to guide ex-
periment is the motivating factor for several, compet-
ing theoretical approaches. Several methods have in-
vestigated HHG in the two-electron He atom by solv-
ing the fully-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation [18, 19].
However, such methods are not easily extended to the
general multielectron case. One of the most success-
ful approaches for general atoms is the Time Depen-
dent conﬁguration-interaction singles (TDCIS) approach,
[10, 20–22]. As the name implies, this method is re-
stricted to the description of singly excited conﬁgura-
tions, and the calculations are only applicable to closed-
shell systems.
In recent years, several other methods
have been proposed which oﬀer various advantages for
the description of strong-ﬁeld processes in multi-electron
systems [23–28]. Among them, R-matrix with time-
dependence (RMT) has emerged as a tractable and ﬂexi-
ble approach to general multielectron systems. Crucially,
for the present manuscript, RMT aﬀords selectivity in the
detail of atomic structure included in calculations, allow-

ing for the description of open-shell systems and multiply
excited states.

RMT is thus the leading method able to describe
atomic structure in suﬃcient detail to provide direct, ab
initio solutions of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion (TDSE) for multielectron atoms or ions. These ca-
pabilities have been demonstrated in the investigation of
photoionization of Ne+ in combined infrared/XUV pulses
[29]. The approach has recently been used to demon-
strate the spin-orbit dynamics in the ground state of
carbon with zero and nonzero initial magnetic quantum
number [30]. Moreover, the RMT code has been adapted
to include a two-electron ﬁnite diﬀerence outer region to
allow the modelling of double-ionization [31–33]. Much
recent success in the application of the RMT method
has been to compliment and even preempt cutting edge
experimental techniques such as attosecond transient ab-
sorption spectroscopy [34], high-harmonic spectral caus-
tics [35] and extreme-ultraviolet-initiated high harmonic
generation [16, 36].

HHG in ionized noble gas atoms remains a subject of
interest for two reasons. Firstly, the highest harmonics
generated in HHG from neutral noble gas atoms have
been attributed to the presence of singly ionized species
[37–39]. And secondly, the role of multiple, closely-
spaced ionization thresholds represents a useful analogue
for molecular systems. We have previously addressed
HHG in singly ionized neon using a previous implementa-
tion of RMT, demonstrating the need for the accurate de-
scription of multiple ionization thresholds in the process
[13]. The equivalent process in singly ionized argon is of
enhanced interest because of the Cooper minimum (CM)
which we have recently shown to exist in the harmonic
spectrum [36]. Such minima are the result of a zero in
the matrix element between the d and s continuum waves
and the 3p-ground state, and have been widely reported
for HHG from Ar atoms following their long-established
appearance in photoionization spectra [7, 8, 40].

The connection between the CM in the photoionization
and HHG spectra has been implicit in many of these pre-
vious studies, but no direct comparison has been made
because no method allowed for the simultaneous determi-
nation of the two. In the present manuscript we present
the results of both photoionization and HHG calculations
for Ar+ and investigate therein the appearance of the
CM.

II. ATOMIC STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS

The overarching theoretical framework for our calcu-
lations is the R-matrix approach [41], wherein conﬁgura-
tion space is divided into two regions. In an inner region,
close to the nucleus, we take full account of multielectron
eﬀects, including electron exchange, via a close-coupling
with pseudostates expansion. An electron can be ejected
into an outer region by ionization and in this region the
electron is spatially isolated from the residual ion and

2

thus exchange can be neglected.

Within the R-matrix paradigm, then, the Ar+ states
are constructed from a single electron and multi-
conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) orbitals for the
residual ion states of Ar2+. The calculation includes all
ﬁnal states with a maximum total angular momentum of
9.

It has been found that there is a strong conﬁguration
dependence in the 3s and 3p orbitals for the ionic states,
as well as for the initial 3s23p5 2P o bound state for
Ar+. Thus, we include in our calculations all physical
1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p orbitals for the Ar2+ description. Fur-
thermore, to improve the description of the Ar2+ ion
states, and hence the ionization process, we also include
pseudo-orbitals 4¯s, 4¯p, 3 ¯d and 4 ¯d to capture short-range
correlation eﬀects not well-described by the physical or-
bitals alone.

If only a single set of orthogonal one-electron orbitals
are employed in the calculation, the obtained threshold
energy deviates signiﬁcantly from the corresponding ex-
perimental value. Thus, it is necessary to include a large
set of doubly-excited conﬁgurations to obtain the correct
binding energy.

In this work, we employ a “3-state” model, including
the three lowest residual ion states– 3P e, 1De and 1Se–
determined from two diﬀerent Ar2+ models:

• “3-CI”: including the lowest three CI basis states,
whereby, 3s23p4, 3s3p5 and 3p6 are included in ob-
taining the wavefunction for each of 3P e, 1De and
1Se residual ion states. In this model we add no
correlation orbitals to the system.

• “9-CI”: where we include additional correlation or-
bitals and allow single and double excitations from
the physical 3s, 3p orbitals to the 3 ¯d orbital. Hence,
in addition to the above, we include all 3s23p33d,
3s3p43 ¯d, 3p53 ¯d, 3s23p23 ¯d2, 3s3p33 ¯d2 and 3p43 ¯d2 CI
basis states in determining the wavefunction.

Including double excitations improves the description
of the wave functions near the nucleus in the residual ion
as well as the interaction between the target and ionized
electron at larger distances. This could have an impor-
tant impact on the description of the ionization process
which impacts on both the PICS and the HHG spectrum.
The energy spacing between the 3P e and 1De states is
within 20% of the experimental value in the 3-CI model
and within 5% in the 9-CI model where we allow for
doubly-excited states by including more correlation or-
bitals. The same trend is seen for the 1Se state (see Tab.
I).

In addition, we employ a “5-state” model, in which we
include the two higher lying residual ion states of 3s3p5
3P o and 1P o. These higher lying ionization thresholds
account for the emission of 3s electrons, whereas, the 3-
state models allow the emission of 3p electrons only. Fi-
nally, the “9-state” model includes an additional two 3P o
(1De) nd
and two 1P o ionic target states. The 3s23p4

states can contain a signiﬁcant admixture of 3s3p6 and
when considering emission of a 3s electron, we need to
take this mixing into account. Although the full inter-
play cannot be accounted for in a tractable calculation,
inclusion of low-lying states may give a ﬁrst indication of
the eﬀects induced by this interaction. This is aﬀorded
by the “9-state” model.

For comparison with Ar+ we also perform a small num-
ber of calculations with neutral argon. The atomic struc-
ture descriptions chosen follow a similar pattern to Ar+.
The simplest model, denoted 1S 1-CI (1 state, one conﬁg-
uration) employs only the 3s23p5 2P o residual ion state,
eﬀectively restricting ionization to the 3p orbital (neglect-
ing the inner-valence 3s orbital). The largest comprises
8 (two 2P e and 2De and one each of 2Se, 2P o, 2F e, and
2F o) residual ion states, and 8 CI basis (8S 8-CI) states
which allow all single- and double-excitations from the
physical 3s and 3p orbitals to the 3 ¯d orbital. We also
employ two models with two residual ion states (2P e and
2Se) with 2 CI and 8 CI basis states respectively (2S 2-CI
and 2S 8-CI). A complete list of the residual-ion states
and conﬁgurations used is shown in Tab. II.

HHG spectra are determined from the time-dependent
expectation value of the dipole operator as extracted
from calculations using the RMT code [43, 44] while pho-
toionization cross sections (PICS) for Ar+ are extracted
from calculations using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Code
(DARC) [45–47]. Calculation of the PICS for neutral
argon is performed with the Breit-Pauli (BP) R-matrix
codes [47, 48]. These diﬀer from the DARC codes in
that they apply relativistic corrections to the Schr¨odinger
equation, whereas the DARC codes solve the Dirac equa-
tion. The RMT codes are non-relativstic, but the same
atomic structure description (atomic orbitals, pseudo-
orbitals, conﬁgurations) is used as the basis for all cal-
culations performed. Test calculations with a prototype,
relativistic RMT code show that the eﬀect of the spin-
orbit interaction on the HHG spectra for light species
such as Ar and Ar+ is minimal, even though these eﬀects
are important for the time-independent calculations with
the DARC and BP codes. The use of the R-matrix frame-
work thus allows a direct comparison between the CM in
the HHG spectrum and PICS. However, we note that the
HHG spectra are resolved into contributions from initial
states aligned with ML = 0 and ML = 1, while the PICS
is obtained from a mixed initial state.

III. CALCULATION PARAMETERS

For the RMT calculations we employ an 8-cycle,
800 nm laser pulse with a 4-cycle sin2 turn-on and turn-
oﬀ and peak intensity of 4 × 1014 Wcm−2. The pulse
is polarized in the z-direction and is spatially homoge-
neous. The wavefunction is propagated using an Arnoldi
propagator of order 8 with a time step of 0.01 a.u.. The

4

radial wave functions of the inner electrons are expanded
on a set of 60 11th order B-splines, using an exponen-
tial distribution of knots near the nucleus to near-linear
near the boundary with outer-region. This allows for a
numerically accurate description both close to, and far
away from, the nucleus up to the boundary at rmax = 15
a.u. The grid spacing in the outer region grid is 0.08 a.u.
where the radial wavefunction of the outer electron is ex-
panded on a ﬁnite-diﬀerence grid out to a radial distance
of 2000 a0.

As described in ref.

[49], using the non-relativstic
Lienard-Wiechert potentials in the far ﬁeld limit, the
electric ﬁeld produced by an accelerated charge is

the largest atomic structure description used we obtain
agreement within 20% between the length and velocity
form. The spectra shown here are all of the length form,
but for all models employed, the comparisons and anal-
ysis between HHG spectra apply both to the length and
velocity forms.

For the DARC calculations, the R-matrix inner region
was set at 13.28 a.u which is just suﬃcient to encom-
pass the diﬀuse, 4p orbital, and 22 continuum orbitals
are used to describe the outgoing electron. An energy
mesh of spacing 55 meV was used to scan the photon
energy range between 27eV and 160eV. The PICS is cal-
culated in Megabarns (1 Mb = 10−18 cm2) as

PICS can also be calculated using both the length and
velocity forms of the dipole operator D. Up to 45 eV,
agreement is found between the two to within 20% and
thus all results shown are provided in the length gauge.

where z is the position operator. Then, the power spec-
trum of the emitted radiation is given, up to a propor-
tionality constant, by |¨d(ω)|2- the Fourier transform of
¨d(t) squared. The dipole acceleration ¨d cannot however
be computed easily (except in simple cases such as atomic
helium) as this quantity is prohibitively sensitive to the
description of atomic structure at very small radial dis-
tances. Instead, the relationships between acceleration,
velocity and displacement can be exploited to express the
harmonic spectrum in terms of the the dipole velocity
and/or length.

Thus in our calculations the harmonic spectrum is cal-
culated from the time-dependent expectation value of the
dipole operator D:

d(t) = (cid:104)Ψ(t)|D|Ψ(t)(cid:105),

and of the dipole velocity operator ˙D:

d(t) = (cid:104)Ψ(t)| ˙D|Ψ(t)(cid:105),

The harmonic spectrum is then given by

model allows only for the ejection of a 3p0 electron, leav-
ing the residual Ar2+ ion in one of the 3P e, 1De or 1Se

escaping the ionic potential with substantial excess en-
ergy.
In the HHG spectrum, the highest energies are
produced by electrons recolliding with the ion, and the
details of atomic structure are thus more pertinent in the
latter case.

Including the 3s3p5 residual ion states in the 5-state,
9-CI model allows the emission of the 3s electron. The
PICS and HHG spectra obtained from calculations us-
ing both the 3-state and 5-state 9-CI models are shown
in Fig. 3. Although the shape of the PICS is altered
somewhat by the inclusion of the 3s ionization channels,
the position of the CM is changed only by 1 eV, and the
HHG spectrum is not aﬀected by the 3s electron at all.
That the CM is robust against the action of the 3s
electron is to be expected: the CM is caused by the re-
lationship between the 3p ground state and the s and
d continua. The ionization of Ar+ should, however, be
sensitive to all open ionization channels. This sensitivity
is more pronounced in the PICS, as photoionization of
the 3s electron by an XUV pulse is substantially more
likely than the tunnel-ionization of the 3s in an IR ﬁeld
as required for HHG. Whereas the photoionization yield
of 3s at 55 eV is 20% of the 3p yield, tunnel ionization of
3s at 800 nm is less than 1% of the 3p yield. Thus while
the changes in the PICS might be attributed to the in-
ﬂuence of the 3s electron, any direct eﬀect on the HHG
spectrum should be negligible.

(blue, dashed line) models. The HHG spectrum is shown for

which makes clear the slight diﬀerence in the positions of the
Cooper Minimum, which are denoted by the vertical lines at

the spectra are around 40% at the minimum and 60% at the

states. The Cooper minimum (CM) is visible in the PICS
at 59 eV in the 3-state, 3-CI model. However, the inclu-
sion of doubly-excited conﬁgurations in the 9-CI model
leads to a shift in the position and shape of the CM, giv-
ing a much deeper minimum centred on 55 eV. Measured
from the minimum to subsequent maximum, the CM has
a depth of 0.40 Mb in the 3-CI case, contrasted with 0.59
Mb for 9-CI. The relative change in the PICS from the
additional structure is around 50% at the CM, and 10%
at high energy (100 eV).

Figure 2 shows the single-atom harmonic spectrum for
Ar+ generated by a 800 nm pulse, with a peak intensity of
4 × 1014 Wcm−2 for the 3-state model, with two diﬀerent
CI bases. As expected, the CM is well replicated in the
HHG spectra. At energies below the CM the harmonic
yield is slightly suppressed in the 9-CI model, which mir-
rors the behaviour of the PICS (Fig. 1). However, at
slightly higher energies the harmonic yield is higher in
the 9-CI case, while the opposite is true for the PICS.
Diﬀerences in harmonic yield at energies just above the
CM may cause a shift in the apparent position of the
minimum, which appears at 64 eV for the 3-CI case, but
at 62 eV in the 9-CI model. We note that these ener-
gies are higher than the corresponding positions in the
PICS (59 eV and 54 eV respectively), which is line with
previous observations of the CM in neutral argon [7, 8].
However, it is interesting to note that the PICS and HHG
spectrum are aﬀected quite diﬀerently by the enhanced
atomic structure: inclusion of the doubly excited conﬁg-
urations in the 9-CI model has only a small eﬀect on the
CM in the HHG spectrum, but changes its position and
depth markedly in the PICS.

Additionally, only small diﬀerences (10%) are observed
at high energy in the PICS, while for the HHG spectra
much larger diﬀerences (60%) are obtained around the
cut-oﬀ. This can be explained intuitively:
in the PICS
the high-energy region is produced by outgoing electrons

Including the further residual ion states in the 9-state
models does, however, illicit more substantial changes in
the HHG yield. While the direct eﬀect of the these chan-
nels on HHG should again be minimal (tunnel-ionization
into the additional channels is 1% of the total ionization),
the additional structure will have an indirect eﬀect due
to enhanced conﬁguration interaction between 3s and 3p
emission channels. Changes in the HHG spectrum could
be attributed to these indirect eﬀects.

Figure 4 shows the PICS and HHG spectra in both the
smallest (3-state, 3-CI) and largest (9-state, 9-CI) mod-
els used. The position of the CM is shifted down by 4 eV
in both the PICS and HHG spectrum. The enhanced
atomic structure description allows a far greater mixing
between the 3s and 3p emission channels, which will af-
fect the CM by modifying both the 3p ground state of
the Ar2+ ion, and the s and p continua of the outgoing
or recolliding electron.

All of this implies that the eﬀect of correlation on the
dominant 3p ionization channels is substantially more im-
portant for HHG than the direct impact of excited resid-
ual ion states. The picture for photoionization is not so
clear, where both the direct impact of additional ioniza-
tion channels, and the inﬂuence of conﬁguration interac-
tion produce non-negligible changes in the PICS.

We have reported previously that changing the total
magnetic quantum number ML can have a signiﬁcant ef-
fect on HHG from noble-gas ions, including Ar+, albeit
for shorter wavelengths [13, 15]. Speciﬁcally, we have
found that for Ar+ initially in the ML = 0 state, the
HHG yield was reduced by a factor of four compared to
ML = 1. For Ne+ the eﬀect was even more pronounced-
with a factor of 26 diﬀerence between the two calcula-
tions. Now we assess the eﬀect for an 800 nm laser, al-
lowing us to see the impact on the CM.

Figure 5 shows the HHG spectra for the 9-state, 9-
CI model with total magnetic quantum number ML = 1
and ML = 0. The harmonic yield is increased by two

(solid, red line) and ML = 1 (dashed blue line). The Cooper
Minimum, is denoted by the vertical lines at 64 (ML = 0) and
63 eV (ML = 1). The renormalised yield for ML = 1 is shown
(light blue-dotted line) to demonstrate that the shape of the
CM is not aﬀected substantially by the change in magnetic
quantum number.

in line
orders of magnitude for ML = 1 over ML = 0:
with Refs.
[13, 15] this reﬂects an increase in the ion-
ization probability for ML = 1. Despite this substantial
increase in yield, the position of the CM is only slightly
altered by the change in the magnetic quantum number,
appearing at 60 (ML = 0) and 63 eV (ML = 1), and in
fact, the shape of the minimum is barely aﬀected at all.
The renormalised spectrum for ML = 1 almost exactly
overlaps the ML = 0 spectrum in the region of the CM.

B. Neutral Argon

Figure 6 shows the HHG spectra and PICS for neu-
tral argon irradiated by an 8-cycle laser of wavelength of
800 nm and peak intensity 4 × 1014 Wcm−2 obtained us-
ing the R-matrix approach for the four models described
in section II. The CM is present in these spectra between
50 and 65 eV and– as was observed for singly-ionized
argon– is shifted systematically to higher energies in the
HHG spectra relative to the PICS. The inclusion of ad-
ditional atomic structure causes the position of the min-
imum to shift to lower energies for both the HHG spec-
tra and PICS, and adding extra residual ion states is
seemingly less important than the accurate description
of electron correlation which is aﬀorded by the inclusion
of more conﬁguration interaction terms. This is reﬂected
in the fact that the position and shape of the minimum
changes quite sharply between the 2S 2-CI and 2S 8-CI
calculations, but does not change substantially between
the 2S 8-CI and 8S 8-CI calculations.

Again, we expect the direct eﬀect of the 3s electron
to be minimal– tunnel ionization of the 3p electron out-
weighs that of the 3s by a factor of 106– and yet the
changes wrought by the 3s electron’s inclusion in both
the HHG spectra and PICS are clearly visible. We can
thus attribute this eﬀect to the indirect eﬀect of corre-

diﬀerences could not be trivially explained by the small
diﬀerence (2 eV) between the position of the minimum
in the photoionization and photorecombination dipoles.
In the present work however, we can venture some
ideas regarding the diﬀerence in the appearance of the
CM based on the diﬀerent atomic structure descriptions
employed in our calculations. Clearly an improvement in
the atomic structure description does not eradicate the
shift and nor should we expect it to, as the shift is re-
ported (for Ar at least) in various experimental works
[7, 8]. Neither do the PICS and HHG spectra respond
uniformly to changes in the atomic structure description–
as noted above and as is visible from Tab. III. For Ar+
the inclusion of additional, 3s ionization thresholds has
a direct impact on the shape of the CM in the PICS, but
not in HHG, while the enhanced description of correla-
tion eﬀects, both via the inclusion of additional conﬁg-
urations and residual ion states, has a similarly marked
eﬀect on both the PICS and HHG spectra. For Ar the
situation is similar, although the inclusion of the 3s ion-
ization thresholds has even less of an eﬀect than for Ar+.
In some sense, this is to be expected– the HHG spec-
trum is generated by a strong ﬁeld, i.e.
is mediated by
low energy photons. This will bias the mechanism to-
wards the ionization of more weakly bound electrons.
By contrast, the PICS is mediated by high energy pho-
tons, which can more easily liberate the inner-valence
electrons. Thus, in the Ar or Ar+ picture, the ioniza-
tion of the 3s electrons will be more important in the
photoionization process than in the HHG process. Corre-
spondingly, the inclusion of additional residual ion states,
which allow a better description of the ionization of the
3s electrons, will have a more substantial inﬂuence on

lation between outgoing electron emission channels. Fi-
nally, comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 4 it is noticeable that
the inclusion of additional atomic structure has a greater
eﬀect on the appearance of the CM in neutral Ar than in
Ar+.

V. ANALYSIS

Table III shows a summary of the position of the
Cooper Minimum for the various calculations performed
in this work. For Ar+ the position of the CM in the
HHG spectrum is systematically higher than in the PICS,
and while the gap ranges from 5 eV (3S 9-CI) to 8 eV
(5S 3-CI) the most complete atomic structure descrip-
tion leads to a gap of 5 eV. For Ar this gap is 10 eV.
This is in line with previous studies of Cooper Minima in
other systems– e.g. experimental measurements in kryp-
ton show a shift of the CM in HHG to higher energies
than the PICS[6]. However, neutral Ar is a better known
case, and some literature values for the position of the
CM in Ar are shown in the table.
(We do observe a
systematic shift to higher energies in our results with re-
spect to the literature values, but note that the relative
diﬀerences between the PICS and HHG spectra are con-
sistent with our results) Higuet et al found shifts from
50 eV to 54 eV (theory) 49 eV to 54 eV (experiment)
between the PICS and HHG minima [8]. However, these

By contrast the inclusion of additional residual ion con-
ﬁgurations (i.e. the improved description of electron cor-
relation) aﬀects the PICS and HHG spectrum similarly,
shifting the CM position from 59 eV to 55 eV and 64 eV
to 60 eV respectively in Ar+. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows
that the same qualitative change in the shape of the min-
imum is eﬀected by the inclusion of these eﬀects in Ar.

Naive models of HHG in might neglect all but the
ground state target system, which we have shown pre-
viously to have a profound impact on the resulting HHG
yield [11, 14]. Here we have demonstrated that even in
strong, long-wavelength laser ﬁelds, the details of atomic
structure, and correlation in particular, can inﬂuence the
appearance of important resonant structures such as the
Cooper Minimum.

VI. CONCLUSION

The appearance of the Cooper Minimum in high-
harmonic spectra has long been used as a test case for the
theoretical connection between the mechanisms of pho-
toionization and HHG [6, 8]. However, until recently, the
capability to describe atomic processes in strong-ﬁelds
with an accurate description of electron correlation was
computationally intractable, and thus a single study ad-
dressing both mechanisms in suitable detail has been elu-
sive. In this paper we have performed a systematic anal-
ysis of the eﬀects of the atomic structure description on
the appearance of the CM in singly-ionized argon in both
the PICS and HHG spectrum, ﬁnding that each process
is sensitive to slightly diﬀerent details of the description.
Photoionization is more sensitive to the description of
the residual ion states (i.e. the accurate description of
multiple ionization pathways), whereas HHG is aﬀected
more by the details of the electron correlation.

We ﬁnd, in concert with studies in other systems, that
the CM appears at lower energies in the PICS than in the
HHG spectrum. For the most complete description used
the CM appears at an energy of 55 eV in the PICS and

8

60 eV in the HHG spectrum in Ar+ and 52 eV and 62 eV
in Ar. We also note that the total magnetic quantum
number has a negligible eﬀect on the position and shape
of the CM in Ar+, despite a two-orders-of-magnitude in-
crease in the harmonic yield for ML = 1 over ML = 0.

What may seem like insigniﬁcant diﬀerences in the
spectra may in fact become very important as the at-
tosecond tool-set expands and provides ever more accu-
rate resolution of atomic structure eﬀects. We have re-
cently reported on XUV initiated HHG [16], which oﬀers
the possibility of stimulating electron correlation eﬀects
with multicolor laser schema (rather than searching for
their ‘natural’ appearance in single-color HHG spectra).
In such scenarios the accurate, time-dependent descrip-
tion of electron-correlation will be absolutely necessary
to analyze experimentally produced spectra and to guide
the development of the theory of attosecond dynamics.
To this end, ongoing development of the R-matrix with
time-dependence method will aﬀord capability to inves-
tigate spin-orbit induced dynamics, the interaction of
atomic or ionic systems with arbitrarily polarised laser
pulses, and time-dependent modelling of molecular sys-
tems, all of which are predicated on the ability to describe
atomic (molecular) structure and correlation eﬀects ac-
curately, and resolve their eﬀects on experimentally ob-
servable quantities, as we have done in this paper.
