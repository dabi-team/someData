A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle. Introduced into
the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally high-purity nitrogen, which under this
hypothesis contains argon impurities. Argon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through
leaks in the purge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diﬀuses through
materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact with the DAMA/LIBRA
detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a modulating 2.8 keV background under two
scenarios. Scenario 1): These impurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron
capture, emitting a 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events
in DAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron ﬂux in
the atmosphere and at the Earth’s surface, which in turn leads to a seasonal variation in 37Ar
production from the reactions 40Ca(n,α)37Ar and 36Ar(n,γ)37Ar. Scenario 2): Radon is also in the
DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the current DAMA/LIBRA limits.
When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the resulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung
radiation cause stable 40Ar to be ionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl)
detectors, resulting in characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result
from radon-induced neutron or gamma-ray ﬂux from the surrounding cavern, leading to a small
modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar within the copper housings.
These two scenarios are straightforward to test through assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo
and laboratory study of the DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation.

The DAMA/LIBRA experiment is a low-background
search for direct dark matter interactions using about
232 kg of high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals viewed by photo-
multiplier tubes, contained within a copper shield, and
located deep underground in the Gran Sasso National
Laboratory (LNGS). An experimental description of
DAMA/LIBRA may be found in [1]. With the ﬁrst
report of a positive annual modulation signal [2] in 1998,
DAMA/LIBRA has ever since observed a signiﬁcant
seasonal variation in its event rate within an energy
range of 2-6 keV electron equivalent [3]. This variation
is measured to be 0.0110 ± 0.0012 cpd/kg/keV, with a
statistical signiﬁcance of 9.3σ. Many experiments have
not observed concomitant dark matter interaction rates,
and it is diﬃcult to construct dark matter models that
can explain DAMA yet are consistent with the various
null results. Several experiments are in operation or
under construction to test the DAMA/LIBRA claim.

Numerous instrumental explanations for this annual
modulation have been proﬀered,
largely based on the
variation of muon rate underground which is correlated
with temperature variations in the stratosphere. These
explanations include modulation of muon ﬂux causing
phosphorescence [4], modulation of neutrons activating
128I
[5], or a combination of solar neutrinos and
atmospheric muons [6]. These explanations all have their
diﬃculties (see [7–9]),
largely consisting of the small
muon ﬂux underground, the single-hit nature of the
DAMA/LIBRA excess, and the challenge of conﬁning the

excess to the 2-6 keV energy range.

Here two scenarios are proposed that could explain
the DAMA anomaly, both involving the generation of
2.8 keV x-rays from argon atoms in the DAMA nitrogen
purge gas. The argon might enter the DAMA/LIBRA
purge system through leaks in its plumbing, or simply
from the tanks of commercially produced high-purity
nitrogen that feed the purge system. Unfortunately, it is
very common for nominally high-purity nitrogen gas to
actually have substantial levels of argon contamination,
as for most applications a bit of argon in the nitrogen is of
no consequence. When specifying nitrogen purity, many
vendors do not distinguish between noble gases and the
nitrogen itself, preferring to only specify impurity levels
in terms of chemically reactive impurities such as O2,
H2O, CO2, CO2, and hydrocarbons.

Scenario 1): A model which parsimoniously explains
the features of the DAMA/LIBRA excess involves the
isotope 37Ar, which has a 35.04-day half-life and is
produced through the reactions 36Ar(n, γ)37Ar (through
thermal neutron capture in the atmosphere) and
40Ca(n,α)37Ar (fast neutron interactions with calcium in
the soil). The latter reaction has a neutron cross-section
peaking in the 5-6 MeV range, at approximately 200 mb
[10]. Upon its decay by electron capture, 37Ar + e− →
37Cl + νe, x-rays can be released from the capture of
the K-shell, L-shell, and M-shell electrons at 2.8 keV,
0.270 keV, and 0.0175 keV with branching ratios of 0.90,
0.09, and 0.009 [11]. Of interest here is the argon K-shell
electron at 2.8 keV.

Famously used [12] by Ray Davis and collaborators to
detect the solar neutrino ﬂux through neutrino capture

 
 
 
 
 
 
on 37Cl, and later used as a neutrino calibration source
for the SAGE experiment [13, 14],37Ar has also been
employed to calibrate gaseous neon [15], two-phase Ar
[16] and two-phase Xe [17, 18] detectors at 0.27 keV
and 2.8 keV, as it provides a convenient, single-site, low-

energy source.
In the re-analysis of the
in dark matter experiments.
LUX 2013 data set [19], a weak line was seen at 2.8
keV, consistent with 37Ar decay, and 37Ar decay events
have been seen in DarkSide data [20]. Measurement
of 37Ar may also be used for detection of underground
nuclear explosions [21], and its calibrated detection is
well-established.

It is well known that neutron ﬂux at the Earth’s surface
varies with the season, peaking in the spring or summer
and falling in the winter. This variation is due to reduced
atmospheric density, and in many locations, also because
of winter snow cover and higher water content in the
soil, which helps to moderate neutrons. The neutron
ﬂux is increased at higher altitudes, and it is known
that this in turn increases the local 37Ar content [22]
in soil air. At Pic-du-Midi in the French Pyrenees, a
25% variation in the 0.1 to 20 MeV neutron ﬂux is
observed [23], with a ratio between thermal, epithermal,
and fast neutron ﬂuxes that varies with the season.
Because 37Ar is produced predominantly by neutron
interactions, one may reasonably expect that its content
in the atmosphere also depends on the season, with
especially high production at high elevations, such as on
the slopes of Gran Sasso (elevation 2912 m) and other
mountains of Abruzzo. At LNGS, the well-ventilated
experimental halls may be expected to have similar 37Ar
levels as the surrounding countryside. If argon manages
to enter the DAMA/LIBRA purge system, then 37Ar may
diﬀuse through sealing materials in the DAMA/LIBRA
detector housings and come in direct contact with its
NaI(Tl) crystals, creating 2.8 keV single-site events.

For a purge gas containing 1% argon, an 37Ar rate of 3
mBq per liter of argon gas, 25000 cm2 of NaI surface area
exposed to the purge gas, and a purge gas-ﬁlled 1-cm gap
between the copper housing and the NaI, one may expect
a total 37Ar x-ray rate of order 40 per day entering the
NaI. If this were to modulate by 25% over the year, then
this would correspond to a modulation of 10 cpd in the
full 232 kg of NaI(Tl). In the 2-6 keV energy window this
would be 0.01 cpd/kg/keV, comparable to the observed
DAMA/LIBRA modulation.

The key assumption behind Scenario 1 is that the
purge gas can ﬁnd its way into the copper housing
surrounding the NaI detectors, as the 2.8 keV x-rays
will not penetrate the copper assuming it is 1-2 mm
thick. These copper housings were sealed at St. Gobain,
encapsulating the NaI crystals so as to avoid crystal
degradation due to moisture. But if the seals were to
open to any degree, this might not be obvious since the
DAMA/LIBRA purge gas is free of moisture. Dedicated
checking of the DAMA/LIBRA detectors could test
whether the copper housings have remained intact. With

more technical details about the nature of the seals
and any epoxy or o-rings used, one could study the
permeation of argon through the seal.

The above hypothesis may be easily tested, ﬁrst by
measuring the argon content of the high-purity nitrogen
purge gas used in DAMA, with samples taken from
from just before entering the
the bottles themselves,
experiment, and on the output nitrogen stream. This will
help to diagnose any ways that argon might be entering
the purge gas. Second, the purge gas could be measured
speciﬁcally for 37Ar using facilities built speciﬁcally for
this purpose [24]. When the 37Ar contamination level is
established, it would be informative to perform a Monte
Carlo study of the degree to which 37Ar contributes to
the DAMA/LIBRA excess, using detailed and accurate
fused silica light guides,
models of the NaI crystals,
photomultipliers, and copper housings, to calculate the
fraction of 37Ar x-rays that could reach a NaI crystal.
In addition, measurement of the magnitude and seasonal
variation of 37Ar backgrounds in LNGS would in any case
be of great interest for the overall dark matter program.
Scenario 2): A second possibility, also involving
argon 2.8 keV x-rays,
is that argon gas inside the
copper housings (directly surrounding the NaI crystals)
is being excited due to seasonally varying 222Rn atoms or
associated neutron and gamma-ray ﬂux, as has been seen
in the Soudan laboratory [25]. The argon may remain
from the original encapsulation of the NaI detectors
if they are very well sealed, or it might come from
argon impurities in the nitrogen purge gas, equilibrating
through diﬀusion in argon content with the gas inside the
copper housing. Gamma or beta rays (from e.g. radon
daughters covering the copper housings) that scatter or
are absorbed by passive material in the housing may also
deposit some energy in the gas inside the housing, either
directly or through bremsstrahlung radiation. If this gas
contains some argon, then the ionized argon will emit 2.8
keV x-rays, which may then penetrate the Tetratec-teﬂon
tape wrapping the NaI(Tl) detectors. This mechanism is
similar to that used in the particle-induced x-ray emission
(PIXE) method, which is widely used for measurement
of trace elements [26]. In this case the exciting particles
are beta and gamma radiation emitted by 222Rn and its
daughters or by neutron-activated materials, while the
element being measured is 40Ar, as its characteristic 2.8
keV x-ray is readily detected by the NaI(Tl) crystals in
DAMA/LIBRA.

DAMA sets an upper limit of 5.8 × 10−2 Bq/m3
(∼ 5000 cpd/m3) for 222Rn decays in its nitrogen purge
gas [27], based on an analysis of double coincidences
of gamma-rays from the decay of 214Bi. The 222Rn
atom, with half-life 3.8 days, decays to a chain of four
short-lived daughters before decaying to 210Pb which
has a half-life of 22 years.
If this combined rate of
∼ 25, 000 cpd/m3 exhibits a small annual modulation,
then this may be passed on to 40Ar excitation inside
the copper housing, resulting in an annual modulation
at 2.8 keV. The required 0.0011 cpd/kg/keV corresponds

to about 10 cpd within the 2-6 keV energy range, well
within the realm of possibility given the above scenario.

even a small

This mechanism can evade the current DAMA/LIBRA
background limits because
rate of
background events, depositing most energy into passive
materials and thereby evading detection at higher
energies, can eﬃciently channel their signal into the 2-6
keV energy range through argon K-shell excitation. The
limit on overall modulation across the energy spectrum
above 90 keV, denoted R90, is consistent with zero but
with uncertainty ranging from 0.17 to 0.19 cpd/kg, or
about 40 cpd. This limit is then weaker than the observed
10 cpd modulated event rate in the 2-6 keV energy region.
So if the rate of argon x-ray production is roughly 25% or
greater than the integrated event rate above 90 keV, then
these 2.8 keV x-rays could produce the observed excess
in the 2-6 keV energy window.

In principle, such decay events could also create
multiple-hit events in DAMA/LIBRA; these are events
in which more than one NaI detector sees an energy
deposition above threshold. The rate quoted by DAMA
for multiple-hit modulation is consistent with zero within
the 2-6 keV window, with an uncertainty of ±0.0004
cpd/keV/kg, or about 4% of the 2-6 keV modulation
signal. In order to create the DAMA/LIBRA excess while
circumventing this limit, event types would be needed
that excite argon atoms and have a probability less than
4% of causing a simultaneous hit in a diﬀerent NaI(Tl)
detector. This seems plausible, given that many of these
events will be from beta particles or low-energy gamma-
rays, which would be unlikely to interact in more than
one NaI(Tl) detector.

This second scenario doesn’t require any 37Ar, just
a bit of argon impurities in the gas in which the
NaI crystals are sealed. The Rn decay rate, the Rn
modulation amplitude, neutron modulation amplitude,
amount of argon excitation, and eﬃciency of 2.8 keV x-
ray detection may each be tuned, so that their product
gives a total detection rate compatible with the DAMA
result. By design, this scenario only creates argon x-
ray events at 2.8 keV, since the chance of double x-
ray detection (leading to events at 5.6 keV) is small by
comparison. The K-shell x-rays from nitrogen, which
would also be produced in this scenario, are at 0.392 keV
and invisible to the DAMA/LIBRA experiment.

The scenarios described above have other noteworthy
properties. They can help to explain why, relative
to a measured natK contamination of 13 ppb [28], an
increased amount (20 ppb) of natK is needed to ﬁt
the constant 3 keV peak that is traditionally ascribed
to x-rays from 40K decay [29]. The diﬀerence may
be explained by a constant (non-modulating) argon x-
ray background, which will not aﬀect ﬁts to data at
higher energies. In addition, the observed amplitude of
the modulation signal substantially decreased after the
original DAMA data gathered from 1995 to 2001, for
which the published modulation amplitude in the 2-6
keV bin was reported to be 0.0200 ± 0.0032 cpd/kg/keV.
One can certainly expect that the amplitude of the
argon x-ray modulation will be geometry-dependent,
and could easily have changed between DAMA/NaI and
DAMA/LIBRA.

In conclusion, it is proposed that the annual modula-
tion in the DAMA/LIBRA single-site event rate is due
to argon gas, a Trojan horse within the copper housing
surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors. This hypothesis may
be tested by monitoring of the DAMA/LIBRA purge
gas for argon impurities, by measuring the purge gas
and atmosphere in LNGS for 37Ar and 222Rn content
and their seasonal variations, testing the copper housings
for leaks and argon diﬀusion rates, and through studies
of the x-ray production of argon-contaminated nitrogen
gas when excited by ionizing radiation. Once the argon
content of the purge gas has been determined, it would
be informative for DAMA to use diﬀerent sources of
purge gas with varying levels of argon, measuring the
eﬀect of argon concentration on the event rate in the 2-6
keV energy range. Low levels of argon concentration in
nitrogen may be achieved through use of boiloﬀ gas from
liquid nitrogen (see [30] and references therein). Given a
detailed model of the detector housings and all materials
used in their construction, NaI(Tl) detectors within, and
argon content of the enclosed gas, a Monte Carlo study of
this system could be performed to simulate the decays of
Rn daughters and neutron activated-materials, so as to
determine whether Scenario 2 is a plausible explanation
for the 2-6 keV excess.
