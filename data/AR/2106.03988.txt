Despite  the  excessive  developments  of  architectural  parametric  platforms,  parametric  design  is  often  interpreted  as  an 

architectural  style  rather  than  a  computational  method.  Also,  the  problem  is  still  a  lack  of  knowledge  and  skill  about  the 
technical application of parametric design in architectural modelling. Students often dive into utilizing complex digital modelling 
without having a competent pedagogical context to learn algorithmic thinking and the corresponding logic behind digital and 
parametric modelling. The insufficient skills and superficial knowledge often result in utilizing the modelling software through 
trial and error, not taking full advantage of what it has to offer. Geometric transformations as the fundamental functions of 
parametric modelling is explored in this study to anchor learning essential components in parametric modelling. Students 
need to understand the differences between variables, parameters, functions and their relations. Fologram, an Augmented 
Reality tool, is utilized in this study to learn geometric transformation and its components in an intuitive way. A LEGO set is 
used as an editable physical model to improve spatial skill through hand movement  beside an instant feedback in the physical 
environment.

1  INTRODUCTION 

Due to the benefits of digital modelling in rapid prototyping, simulation, and alternative design generation, most 

teachers  aim  to  rapidly  teach  3D  modelling  software  to  students  in  the  early  stages  of  design.  However,  a 
competent context for learning parametric modelling concepts and essentials of “digital design thinking” is rarely 

provided in architectural educational systems. Indeed, a general understanding of fundamental programming 
concepts  behind  computational  design  modelling  may  help  students  better  understand  the  logic  behind 

modelling  software.  Students  are  expected  to  identify  and  utilize  modelling  techniques  without  a  proper 
understanding of digital design components named as variables (as the properties of the geometry), parameters 

(as the members of the function family), and functions (as the mapping operations). Superficial knowledge of 
digital design thinking often results in learning computational modelling through trial-and-error.  

Learning  geometric  transformations  as  one  of  the  fundamental  components  of  parametric  modelling  is 
essential  for  effective  development  of  3D  modelling  in  computational  design  [1].  Analyzing  complex 

architectonic forms usually requires a high level of visualization and mental modelling skills and transformation

knowledge to decompose multiple transformations mentally. Such skills become specifically critical in applying 
parametric modelling techniques, which usually starts from simple geometry but often results in a complicated 

geometric  form  through  multiple  transformations  such  as  Rotation,  Translation,  Dilation,  etc.  However,  the 
difficulty  of  learning  geometric  transformation  and  spatial-based  problems  is  acknowledged  clearly  in  the 

literature [2][3]. Understanding geometric transformation as mappings and  functions rather than simple motions 
improves students’ perception of transformation concepts [4]. Hence, It can help them in mental prediction and 

analysis  of  geometric  transformation  beyond  verified  action  [2].  Such  advanced  level  of  reasoning  helps 
students understand the logic behind parametric / digital modelling techniques and may assist them in utilizing 

parametric modelling techniques more efficiently and professionally. Meanwhile, the significance of traditional 
methods  including  physical  modelling  and  hand  drawing  is  well  acknowledged  in  perceiving  geometry  and 

geometric relations for architectural and engineering students [5][6]. However, the quick switch towards digital 
modelling,  because  of  their  enormous  privilege,  may  result  in  less  exploitation  of  the  potential  benefits  of 

physical models in cognitive learning, mental visualization, design innovation, and problem-solving. 

Augmented  Reality  (AR)  technology  as  a  mediator  tool,  capable  of  integrating  digital  environment  with 

physical real-world, can provide a spatial experiment to support embodied learning and virtual augmentation of 
information and abstract, “putting answers right where the questions are” [7]. The inherent capability of AR in 

superimposing  the  virtual  information,  including  digital  modelling  and  computer  graphics  (e.g.,  arrows,  tags, 
highlighting,  etc.)  in  a  3D  space  may  help  students  perceive  geometric  transformations  as  mappings  and 

functions beyond motions while exploring corresponding parameters in an integrated spatial scenario. In the 
meantime, the physical experiment in a 3D environment could play as a feedback besides improving spatial 

visualization skill through playing with a tangible manipulative.This study explores the educational potential of 
AR with Fologram in learning geometric transformations and  digital design thinking before diving into complex 

parametric  modelling  methods.  Fologram  is  an  AR  tool  capable  of  synching  parametric  modelling  with  AR 
environment [8]. This study intends to break down the process of basic geometric transformations into their 

function  components  in  a  learning  AR  environment  with  real-time  feedback  using  physical  model.  In  this 
environment, students can play with multiple parameters of the transformation functions to transform geometry’s 

variables and follow the augmented result in the AR environment through tracing the transformation with the  
physical model in the physical environment. A LEGO model, as an editable tangible interface, is proposed in 

this  study  to  keep  track  of  the  digital  parametric  changes  to  fortify  learning  impact  and  spatial  skills  while 
supporting  feedback.  This  methodology  is  expected  to  improve  student’s  understanding  of  geometric 

transformations  and  their  corresponding  components  (variables,  parameters,  and  operation  functions)  in  a 
“Learning Through Play” environment. 

2  RELATED WORK 

The  existing  computer-assisted  methods  in  enhancing  students’  learning  of  geometry  and  spatial 
transformations  confirm  the  benefits  of  digital  models’  dynamic  features.  These  studies  acknowledge  that 

exploring  geometry  and  geometric  relations  from  different  perspectives  helps  students  better  understand 
geometry and improve their spatial skills, especially mental rotation, and spatial visualization [9]–[11]. However, 

many students still face challenges in solving geometric problems and mostly rely on a trial-and-error method 
[12].

Parametric  design 

to  understand  geometry  and  geometric 
transformations by learning the impact of variables and parameters on their geometric design  process. This 

techniques  may  allow 

the  students 

level of reasoning can help them in improving design creativity and reframing design problems [13]. However, 
in many cases, at the end of the  design studio students cannot identify their process in arriving to their final 

geometric solution since their work is mostly done through trial-and-error rather than a higher level of reasoning 
[14]. Longitudinal-experimental studies reveal that working with 3D modelling alone may not improve students’ 

spatial skills and geometric perception; thus, traditional methods (e.g., hand drawing and physical modelling) 
are  still  required  [15][16].  Physical  modelling  on  the  other  hand,  as  a  “versatile”  tool  for  the  designers  and 

architects to express their thoughts in the design process is the most realistic and tangible 3D means to explore 
design  thoughts  and  presentations  [6].  Studies  have  acknowledged  the  benefits  of  such  tangible  tools  in 

improving  spatial  visualization  skills  [17].  Psychological  studies  argue  that  physical  interaction  encourages 
students’  epistemic  actions  [18].  Such  skills  help  them  in  forming  embodied  metaphors  of  abstracts  and 

internalizing the information that could enhance memory retrieval [18].  

AR has been introduced in literature as the extension of Virtual Reality (VR) that let users take advantage of 

the synthetic environment while having immediate interaction with their physical surroundings [19]. AR as a tool 
supporting  situated  cognition  environment  can  provide  a  spatial  experiment  where  learning  and  applying 

knowledge  occur  at  the  same  time  in  the  same  place  [18].  AR  has  been  widely  used  in  STEM  (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education such as physics, mathematics, and chemistry to support 

real-world  perception  of  abstract  information    to  ease  the  learning  process.  The  results  show  that  AR  has 
positive  impact  on  spatial  visualization  skill  [20],  understating  of  mathematical  concepts  [21],  learning 

performance,  and  higher knowledge  gain  [22][23].  In  a  recent experimental study  conducted  by  Fidan  et  al. 
2019,  the  impact  of  AR  system  integrated  with  Problem  Based  Learning  (PBL)  technique  is  investigated  to 

assess students’ learning achievement and knowledge retention in learning physics and natural phenomena 
[22]. The results reveal that AR technique not only fortifies PBL but also facilitates transfer of knowledge to real-

life problems as well as promoting students’ engagement in learning the targeted subject [22]. The application 
of AR in architecture and architectural education mostly has focused on visualizing building components and 

information  [24][25],  building  energy  performance  and  lighting  simulation  [26][27],  and  interior  design 
augmentation [28][29]. Very few projects have recently started to explore integrating parametric components 

with parametric modelling through AR intervention [8], or a complete VR environment via VR tools [30]; however, 
none of the studies has explored the educational potential of AR in learning parametric modeling. 

2.1  Reflective feedback in education  

AR provides a context where hands-on experiences could take place in a physical environment along with digital 
information. This feature could potentially support a real-time feedback through physical realization of digital 

interaction in the real-world environment. 

Extensive  research  on  the  importance  of  self-regulated  learning  (SRL)  and  the  role  of  self-regulation 

mechanisms  in  learning  enhancement  and  compensation  of  individual  differences  suggests  that  proactive 
learning  has a significant impact on students’ academic success  [31]. These studies demonstrate that  SRL 

could be accomplished through constructive feedback as a learning tool [32].  Meanwhile the feedback are only 
useful if students are afforded with opportunity to integrate it with their prior knowledge [33]. Studies reflect that 

heterogeneous student populations, lack of resources, and population increase in higher education result in

deficient constructive feedback to provide students with the opportunity to enhance their learning [32][34]. Most 
students require detailed feedback on learning the targeted subject; however, they mostly value their grades 

rather than feedbacks and comments to improve their learning process [35]. This problem may become more 
critical in architectural education in learning digital modeling techniques that is utilized only as a tool to realize 

the design goal and less focus is conducted in learning the modeling  tool professionally. Lack of constructive 
feedback in modeling software could be a reason why students are learning through trial-and-error. Constructive 

feedbacks  help  students  with  self-regulation  process,  stimulate  their  motivation,  and  improve  students  self-
esteem [31]. 

3  METHODOLOGY 

The study proposes three educational aids: 1) Grasshopper as a parametric modeling tool, 2) Fologram, an AR 
tool capable of synching parametric modeling with AR environment to augment abstract information, and 3) a 

tangible LEGO model (#5891) as an editable physical manipulative. The digital model is an FBX model imported 
into Grasshopper. Other digital models could also be imported to the program and used as a model target in 

Fologram; however, customizations may be required to realize the prototype’s tasks. QR code is utilized in AR 
registration to superimpose digital model and abstractions on the physical environment.  

The  study  uses  the  capability  of  Fologram  to  synchronize  the  corresponding  parameters  of  different 
geometric  transformations  such  as  translation  and  rotation  in  Grasshopper  to  help  students  understand 

geometric  transformations  as  mappings  and  functions  rather  than  simple  motions.  The  corresponding 
parameters, synchronized to the AR app, could be modified by the player using sliders and toggle buttons to 

apply  desired  transformations.  The  transformations  could  be  applied  to  parts  of  the  LEGO  model  that  are 
transformable in the physical environment. The LEGO model #5891 is a house model with editable parts such 

as a movable attic and rotatable doors/windows. Graphical abstractions such as coordinate system, rotation 
angles,  translation  vectors,  and  distance  notations  are  visualized  in  the  AR  environment  to  help  students 

understand different parameters of transformation functions in an intuitive way and track them through actual 
motion in the physical environment. Two prototypes are conducted for two common types of transformations: 

translation and rotation. 

3.1  Prototype1 

In this prototype, Grasshopper component for translation is utilized with two inputs including targeted geometry 

as  the variable  and  translating  vector  as  the  function  parameter. The  translation  vector is  broken into three 
sliders representing translation values in each coordinate axis (x, y, and z). Although variables are the points, 

lines and surfaces of a corresponding geometry, to simplify the process the attic part of the LEGO model which 
is movable in the real LEGO is utilized as the variable to apply translation. 

Students  can  play  with  the  function  parameters  and  observe  the  impact  of  parameter  changes  on  the 
corresponding variable. The translation vector besides a notation which demonstrates the translation amount 

will be visualized in real-time in AR environment to demonstrate the mapping operation. The student can play 
with the physical piece to track the change through hand movement. For example, s/he can apply translation in 

any of the three directions of x, y and z through sliding the corresponding sliders; the transformed geometry will 
be augmented in AR environment; and the player can follow the translation action in the real environment by 

applying motion to the physical element (Figure1).

3.2  Prototype2 

In this prototype a Python script is utilized to provide a customized rotation function using the RhinoScriptSyntax 

(RS) library. While the Grasshopper rotation component asks for two parameters (rotation angle and plane), the 
RS library needs three parameters i.e., rotation angle, axis and pivot. The function is customized by the authors 

to add the direction of the rotation as a separate parameter. The four parameters with their possible  parameter 
options/values are utilized as the input of the rotation function naming as: 1) rotation angle (-180⁰ to 180⁰), 2) 

rotation axis (x, y, and z), 3) rotation direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise), and 4) rotation base point (the 
local pivot point upon which rotation is applied). Figure 2 shows a snippet of the visual programming component 

and the corresponding parameters synched to Fologram AR.

Figure 2: Grasshopper snippet for rotation function utilizing four input parameters and the geometry 

In this prototype the variables are the rotatable openings (doors/windows) in the physical LEGO model. The 

player  can  choose  which  geometry  s/he  desires  to  apply  rotation  function  by  changing  the  slider  that 
corresponds to the index of a selected geometry. Eight options exist based on the eight rotatable elements in 

the LEGO model. These elements could be rotated in the physical model with certain constraints, i.e. rotation 
axis, rotation direction and rotation pivot position. When the element is selected the position of the local pivot 

point upon which rotation will be applied is displayed as coordinate system (Figure 3). 

Figure 3. Player selects a modifiable opening (e.g., garage door, window, or entrance door) via slider representing variable 
indices to apply rotation using the angle slider. 

The displayed coordinates may not be placed in a correct position of the selected geometry based on the 

applicable rotation of the physical element. Hence, students need to plug in the correct parameters to locate

the pivot point on the correct position where rotation is applicable through the physical model. For this prototype 
the parameters to select the correct rotation point (six parameters shown in Figure 2) are accessible through 

Grasshopper,  which  is  synched  in  real-time  in  the  AR  experiment.  Later,  students  can  play  with  other 
parameters such as rotation axis, rotation direction and angle displayed in AR through number sliders and/or 

toggle buttons (Figure 4).  

Figure 4. Student plays with different parameters of rotation function to match a transformation applicable in the 
corresponding physical piece. The bottom right image shows all potential parameters that player can modify through AR.  

In this prototype the physical model is used not only to track the transformation in the physical world but also 

as a real time feedback to apply a transformation with specific parameters. Hence, although students can play 
with different parameters through various UIs and observe the augmented result, selecting a wrong parameter 

(e.g., wrong rotation axis, direction, or local pivot)  results in a rotation which is not applicable in the physical 
model. For example, the entrance door can only rotate around z-axis in a clockwise direction when the pivot 

point is positioned at the left corner (Figure 5).

4  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

The study has presented an AR method for learning two common geometric transformations named translation 
and rotation as fundamental components of parametric modeling. In this study the geometric transformations 

are  broken  down  into  their  corresponding  components  as  input  (variables  and  parameters)  and  operation 
functions to intuitively demonstrate geometric transformations as mappings and functions beyond motions in a 

“Learning  Through  Play”  environment  via  a  spatial  experiment.  The  LEGO  model  is  utilized  as  a  physical 
tangible  manipulative  and  a  real-time  feedback  to  improve  spatial  skill  through  hand  movement;  integrating  

physical and virtual object transformations with real-world experiment in an AR environment. 

The application of this study could expand to other fields of design and engineering where creating a spatial 

experiment and contextualizing abstract information such as mathematical concepts related to geometry and 
transformations  are  significant  in  learning  the  subject.  The  current  platform  is  limited  to  certain  types  of 

parameters in AR display (slider and button) and the communication is only one way, meaning that user needs 
to  match  the  digital  augmentation  in  the  real  world  and  the  reverse  automatic  integration  is  not  possible. 

Because the app is non-open source it has certain constraints for further customization. For example, it is limited 
in adding notations and graphical math representations.  In addition, hand and object occlusion is an issue in 

the current version of Fologram. Moreover, It is important to mention that working with Fologram in Grasshopper 
and  conducting customizations  may  require knowledge  and  expertise  in parametric  modeling and  using  the 

required  plugins.  Considering the  abovementioned constraints  and  limitations,  the  authors  are  developing  a 
standalone educational app based on the assembly project – BRICKxAR [36] to address the challenges and 

issues exposed with Fologram AR in developing an educational platform for learning geometric transformations. 
In  the  future  the  authors  intend  to  conduct  user  studies  to  evaluate  the  claim  -  AR  enhancing  learning  of 

transformations  -  through  experimental  and  control  groups,  using  AR  and  non-AR  learning  methods, 
respectively. Multiple evaluation methods including spatial ability tests [37] , math tests, NASA_TLX [38], and 

motivation survey [33] will be used to assess the learning gain, cognitive load, motivation and engagement of 
students in learning the targeted subjects.
