Systematic examination of fusion for 39,41,45,47 K + 28Si and 36,44Ar + 28Si provides insight into
the impact of neutron and proton exchange on fusion for nuclei at and near the N=20 and N=28
shells. Comparison of the reduced excitation functions reveals a marked diﬀerence between the
behavior of open-shell and closed-shell systems. While coupled channels calculations provide a good
description for the closed-shell nuclei they signiﬁcantly under-predict the fusion cross-section for
open-shell nuclei. The observed trends are examined in the context of a potential energy surface,
including shell eﬀects, and multi-nucleon exchange with consideration of Pauli-blocking.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear reactions of neutron-rich nuclei play a key role
in nucleosynthesis both in astrophysical environments [1]
as well as terrestially in accelerator-based experiments
[2, 3]. One topic of particular interest both theoreti-
cally as well as experimentally is the question about the
enhancement or suppression of the fusion cross-section
for neutron-rich nuclei [4–7]. For extremely neutron-rich
nuclei, as a result of their weakly bound valence neu-
trons, one might observe reduced spatial coupling of the
neutron and proton distributions and the emergence of
novel neutron dynamics which enhance the fusion cross-
section. At energies near the fusion barrier the fusion
process is particularly interesting as the timescale of the
collision is suﬃciently long for collective dynamics of the
neutron and proton density distributions to inﬂuence the
fusion process. It is presently unclear how this dynam-
ics is impacted by the shell structure of the initial nuclei.

Although it is well established that inelastic excitation of
the two nuclei as they approach [8] and transfer of one or
more nucleons [9, 10] can modify the fusion probability in
particular systems, a more comprehensive understanding
is presently lacking [10].

Theoretical calculations of the fusion using a density-
constrained TDHF approach found an enhancement of
fusion for the asymmetric system 24O + 16O as com-
pared to 16O + 16O [11]. This enhancement is understood
as resulting from neutron transfer which modiﬁes the
potential between the nuclei, lowering the barrier. For
even more neutron-rich nuclei–at the limit of stability–
namely 24O + 24O, fusion is suppressed relative to 24O +
16O. This suppression of fusion for symmetric neutron-
rich systems has been attributed to a repulsive Pauli po-
tential arising from the overlap of the neutron-rich tails
[12]. However, these calculations are one-body and ne-
glect many-body correlations which could enhance cor-
related transfer. Moreover, they are limited in that they
only reﬂect the average behavior of the system.

Experimental evidence of

fusion enhancement for
neutron-rich nuclei also exists. Neutron exchange of va-

 
 
 
 
 
 
lence neutrons in Ni + Ni systems were proposed as possi-
bly responsible for an observed increase in the sub-barrier
fusion cross-section [13]. Recent measurements provide
further evidence of fusion enhancement due to the pres-
ence of a one-neutron halo (15C) [14] or an unpaired neu-
tron (19O) [15]. However, experimental measurements
conﬁrm that the neutron-richness of the colliding nuclei
alone is not the only factor impacting the fusion proba-
bility as indicated by examination of Ca+Ca collisions.
While fusion of a 48Ca projectile with a 40Ca target nu-
cleus is enhanced as compared to a 40Ca projectile [16],
fusion of 48Ca + 48Ca is suppressed below the barrier [17].
It has recently been observed that, at above-barrier en-
ergies, after accounting for systematic size and Coulomb
eﬀects, the fusion cross-section for open shell nuclei near
the N=20 and N=28 shells is larger than that of the
closed-shell nuclei [18]. This result has been interpreted
as enhanced binding of the closed-shell nuclei as com-
pared to open-shell nuclei as they merge.

In the present work, motivated by these prior above-
barrier results, we examine for the ﬁrst time fusion in
39,41,45,47K and 36,44Ar +28Si and explore the role of
shell structure and N/Z equilibration on the fusion cross-
section.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Radioactive beams of K and Ar ions were produced by
the coupled cyclotron facility at MSU-NSCL and ther-
malized in a linear gas stopper before being re-accelerated
by the ReA3 linac [18]. The re-accelerated beam was
transported to the experimental setup where it impinged
upon the 28Si target. Details on the experimental setup
have been previously published [19].

Contaminants in the radioactive beam were identiﬁed
and rejected on a particle-by-particle basis by performing
a ∆E-TOF measurement [18, 19]. The target composi-
tion was characterized using Rutherford Backscattering
measurement (RBS) and conﬁrmed using X-ray Photo-
electron spectroscopy [20]. This RBS measurement re-
vealed a 28Si thickness of 258 ± 10 µg/cm2 and an oxygen
thickness of 98 ± 4 µg/cm2. The experimental resolution
allowed reaction products from the fusion of the beam
with 28Si and 16O to be distinguished [19]. The intensi-
ties of the K and Ar beams incident on the target ranged
between 1.0 x 104 (44Ar/s) and 4.5 x 104 (39K/s). Fusion
of the incident K and Ar ions with the oxygen nuclei has
been previously published [18].

Fusion of K (Ar) ions with the 28Si target results in
a compound nucleus (CN) of As (Ge). De-excitation of
the CN via neutron, proton and α emission deﬂects the
resulting evaporation residue (ER) from the beam direc-
tion. The ER was detected in annular Si(IP) detectors
(1.0◦ < θlab < 7.3◦) and distinguished from scattered
beam using the energy/time-of-ﬂight (ETOF) technique
[19].

Extraction of the fusion cross-section, σF , is achieved

2

by measuring the yield of ERs and utilizing the relation
σF = NER/(ǫER × t × NI ) where NER is the number of
evaporation residues detected, NI is the number of beam
particles of a given type incident on the target, t is the
target thickness, and ǫER is the detection eﬃciency. The
number of detected residues, NER, is determined by sum-
ming the number of detected residues identiﬁed by the
ETOF technique. Uncertainty in identifying an ER as-
sociated with fusion on 28Si is reﬂected in the error bars
presented. Beam particles with the appropriate identi-
ﬁcation in the ∆E-TOF map provided the measure of
NI . A statistical model was employed to describe the
de-excitation of the fusion product. Together with the
geometric acceptance of the experimental setup this pro-
vided the detection eﬃciency, ǫER. which varied between
≈ 78-84% over the entire energy range.

An eﬀective means of comparing the fusion excitation
function for diﬀerent systems is the use of the reduced
excitation function [7]. Comparison of fusion for an iso-
topic chain allows utilization of the simplest scaling pre-
scription. The systematic increase in size with increas-
ing mass number A is accounted for by scaling the fusion

reduced cross-section on the incident energy relative to

Presented in Fig. 1a are the reduced fusion excitation
functions for 39,41,45,47K + 28Si. For all systems the re-
duced fusion cross-section above the barrier is similar.
Below the barrier however, signiﬁcant diﬀerences are ap-
parent between the diﬀerent systems. The data clearly
organize into two groups: one associated with 39K and
47K (closed neutron shells at N=20 and N=28 respec-
tively) and the other with 41K and 45K (open neutron
shells). This similarity of the reduced fusion cross-section
for 39K and 47K projectiles indicates that the density dis-
tributions, relevant to fusion, for the two closed-shell K
isotopes are similar when scaled by A1/3. In marked con-
trast, a larger reduced fusion cross-section is evident for
the open-shell 41K (N=22) and 45K (N=26), beyond the
systematic A1/3 scaling. This enhancement of the fu-
sion cross-section for the open-shell nuclei increases with
decreasing energy below the barrier. The same enhance-
ment at sub-barrier energies is observed for the open-shell
36,44Ar nuclei as compared to the closed-shell K isotopes
in Fig. 1b. This present observation of the diﬀerence in
the fusion of open-shell and closed-shell was conﬁrmed by
reexamining the literature. Enhancement of the fusion
cross-section for an open-shell nucleus (124Sn) as com-
pared to a closed-shell nucleus (132Sn) is also evident for
40,48Ca targets [21].

functions grouped by their proximity to the N=20 and

N=28 shells. In Fig. 2a one observes that 36Ar and 41K
exhibit similar excitation functions with a marked en-
hancement of the reduced fusion cross-section as com-
pared to the closed-shell 39K (N=20). This result indi-
cates that the presence of two holes below the closed-
shell (36Ar) is eﬀectively the same as the presence of two
particles above the closed-shell (41K) in determining the
reduced fusion cross-section. A similar enhancement in
the reduced fusion cross-section is observed at the N=28
shell for the presence of two holes in 44Ar and 45K as
compared to 47K.

III. COMPARISON WITH THEORETICAL
MODELS

The simplest description of fusion involves the inter-
action of the density distributions of the two interacting
nuclei. For a non-adiabatic interaction (sudden approxi-
mation) consideration of the ground-state density distri-

butions suﬃces. For adiabatic collisions, collective modes
in the colliding nuclei can be excited and also need to be
considered. Inclusion of these modes in a coupled chan-
nels (CC) formalism results in an increase in the fusion
cross-section at energies near and below the Coulomb
barrier [22, 23]. To investigate whether the observed fu-
sion excitation functions can be described by the inter-
action of the density distributions of the projectile and
target nuclei, the S˜ao Paulo model was used. The S˜ao
Paulo potential (SPP) [24] is a local equivalent double
folding of the projectile and target matter densities on
the zero-range interaction.

Prior work demonstrated the sensitivity of the fusion
cross-section to accurate ground-state density distribu-
tions [18]. To provide reasonably accurate matter den-
sity distributions, which include two-body correlations,
we performed Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov (DHB) calcula-
tions [25]. The correlations in the DHB calculations of

the present work are limited to surface-pairing correla-
tions. These correlations can make subtle modiﬁcations
to the nuclear surface, extending and modifying the nu-
clear density. The details of these mean ﬁeld calculations
using an axially-symmetric self-consistent approximation
are reported in Ref. [26].

Using the ground-state DHB matter distributions for
both the projectile and 28Si target nuclei, the SPP was
generated and used to calculate the fusion cross-section.
The theoretical predictions, represented by the dashed
lines, are compared with the experimental data in Fig.
3. Comparison of these one-channel (DHB-OC) theoret-
ical predictions with the experimental excitation func-
tions is revealing. For the closed neutron shell isotopes
39,47K, the DHB-OC calculations provide a reasonable
prediction of the excitation function over the entire en-
ergy interval measured although the model calculations
lie slightly below the experimental data particularly in
the sub-barrier regime. In the case of the open neutron
shell 41K, 45K and 36Ar, the model dramatically under-
predicts the measured cross-sections, particularly at sub-
barrier energies. This under-prediction for the case of the
open-shell nuclei suggests that the ground-state conﬁgu-

rations alone are insuﬃcient in describing the measured
cross-sections. In the case of 44Ar insuﬃcient data exists
at low energy to draw a deﬁnitive conclusion.

As coupling to low-lying collective modes acts to
increase the fusion cross-section we have performed
coupled-channels (CC) calculations to investigate the ex-
tent to which the presence of low-lying states increases
the fusion cross-section. The 1.779 MeV, 2+ and 4.618
MeV, 4+ ﬁrst states of the target were considered. The
coupling to the low-lying projectiles states does not pro-
duce a considerable eﬀect on the fusion cross-section. To
account for the couplings between the low-lying states
the transition probabilities were taken from Ref. [27].

The results of the CC calculations are shown in Fig.
3 as solid lines. In the case of the closed-shell nuclei, 39K
and 47K, inclusion of the excitations considered provides
a good description of the fusion cross-section. However,
in the case of the open-shell nuclei the experimental data
are signiﬁcantly enhanced relative to the CC calculations
with inclusion of low-lying excitations. It is particularly
interesting to note that the magnitude of the enhance-
ment is much larger than the increase due to the inclu-
sion of inelastic excitation in the CC calculations. This
enhancement suggests that transfer might be occurring
prior to fusion.

Neutron transfer prior to fusion is often proposed as re-
sponsible for an enhancement in the fusion cross-section
[13, 28, 29]. For a system with zero Q-value for two neu-
tron transfer, 60Ni + 58Ni, inelastic excitations dominate
and neutron transfer plays a negligible role [8]. When
one of the colliding nuclei is neutron-rich relative to its
collision partner, as in the case of 40Ca + 96Zr positive
Q-value neutron transfer channels act to increase the fu-
sion cross-section at sub-barrier energies as compared to
40Ca + 90Zr [30–33]. We present the relevant Q-values
in Table I [34]. With the exception of 39K the Q-value
for two-neutron transfer in the other K isotopes is posi-
tive. Transfer of one neutron from 39K to 28Si is -4.604
MeV, while for 47K it is slightly positive (+0.1 MeV).
Nonetheless, the fusion excitation function for these two
nuclei with 28Si is comparable. The Q-value for neu-
tron transfer for the open-shell cases 41,45K lies between
that of 39K and 47K yet the fusion excitation functions
of the open-shell cases diﬀer from those of the closed-
shell. Clearly the observed behavior of the experimental
fusion excitation functions cannot be understood simply
by consideration of the Q-value for neutron transfer.

The consideration of the Q-value for neutron trans-
fer ignores the role of protons during the fusion process.

dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) model allows the
neutron and proton density distributions to evolve as
the collision proceeds while incorporating all of the dy-
namical entrance channel eﬀects such as neck formation,
particle exchange, internal excitations, and deformation
eﬀects [35]. Such calculations for the system 132Sn +
40,48Ca clearly indicate the correlated ﬂow of neutrons
and protons. Unfortunately, for nuclei with unpaired nu-
cleons the DC-TDHF calculations are considerably more
challenging with a signiﬁcant sensitivity to the inclusion
of pairing [36].

We therefore consider qualitatively how initial nucleon
exchange could impact fusion at near and sub-barrier en-
ergies using a conceptually simple physical framework.
When the two colliding nuclei are within the range of the
strong force nucleon exchange is allowed. This exchange
of protons and neutrons is governed by a potential energy
surface (PES). Flow of nucleons between the two nuclei is
stochastic and allows equilibration of mass, charge, and
energy [37]. The diﬀerential ﬂow of neutrons and protons
between the colliding nuclei results in both a net change
in the atomic and mass numbers as well as excitation
of the system. The nucleon ﬂow is mitigated by Pauli-
blocking of scattering into occupied states. Independent
of the gradient of the potential, proton exchange is ini-
tially disfavored relative to neutron exchange because of
the Coulomb barrier between the two nuclei. This physi-

5

cal picture was largely successful in explaining the charge
and mass distributions associated with strongly damped
collisions along with the characteristic dissipation of ki-
netic energy [38]. A key factor driving the equilibration of
N/Z in strongly-damped heavy-ion collisions is the gradi-
ent of the PES in the vicinity of the entrance channel [39].
A stochastic mean ﬁeld approach utilizing this nucleon
exchange framework successfully explained the dispersion
of the mass distribution in 58Ni + 60Ni for damped col-
lisions [40].
It was hypothesized that for slightly more
central collisions that resulted in fusion such a physical
picture should still be valid. Unfortunately, the diﬀusion
approach employed does not allow a description of the
transition from multi-nucleon transfer to fusion [40]. We
emphasize that in the present work we only utilize this
physical picture to understand the factors inﬂuencing the
initial neutron and proton exchanges prior to fusion.

To assess the factors inﬂuencing the initial nucleon ex-
changes, the PES was calculated for all binary combi-
nations of a colliding system. The PES calculated corre-
sponds to the liquid drop energy modiﬁed by shell correc-
tions as well as a proximity interaction [38]. The surface
was calculated at the strong absorption radius (approxi-
mately 10 fm in all cases shown) for zero impact parame-
ter. As our aim is a qualitative description for these near
and sub-barrier collisions and the systems considered are
similar in mass asymmetry, ignoring the role of angular
momentum in modifying the surface is justiﬁed.

The PES for each of the four K + 28Si systems is dis-
played in Fig. 4. Arrows indicate the gradient of the po-
tential in the NZ plane with the initial projectile-target
combination indicated by the solid (red) symbol. The
magnitude of the gradient is indicated by the numbers
(in MeV) adjacent to selected arrows.

richness which nonetheless exhibit the same reduced

projectile-target combination already lies along the valley
of the PES in the NZ plane. Therefore, correlated neu-
tron and proton exchange is required in order to main-
tain N/Z equilibrium. While any initial proton transfer is
disfavored because of the Coulomb barrier, proton trans-
fer from 28Si to 39K is additionally suppressed by Pauli
blocking [38]. This suppression of initial proton exchange
suppresses the neutron exchange.

In the case of 47K, the PES is quite diﬀerent. The
initial system has a signiﬁcant gradient to decrease the
neutron number and increase the atomic number of the
47K nucleus. While neutron transfer out of the K nucleus
is favored, proton pickup from the 28Si is also favored
due to the large N/Z asymmetry of the system. Pauli
blocking of initial proton transfer limits the ability of the
system to follow the gradient of the PES and attain N/Z
equilibrium in an eﬀective manner.

For the open neutron shell nuclei, neutron transfer is
not hindered by the energy cost of breaking the neutron
shell. For 41K, as indicated by the PES, transfer of a
neutron from 41K to 28Si can occur without any driving

6

force for proton transfer. Net transfer of one neutron
in this physical picture corresponds to multiple neutron
exchanges. These multiple neutron exchanges excite the
K nucleus which lessens the Pauli-blocking of subsequent
proton exchanges. Subsequent proton transfer into or out
of the K nucleus are equally energetically favorable as
indicated by the PES. One might hypothesize that these
initial neutron exchanges, not just the net transfer of one
neutron, by reducing the Pauli-blocking act to increase
the fusion probability.

The case of the 45K is intermediate between that of 41K
and 47K and more diﬃcult to interpret. While pickup of a
proton by the 45K is favored along with loss of a neutron,
the magnitude of the gradient is less than in the 47K case.
The smaller driving force for proton pickup relative to
47K suggests a lesser role of proton transfer on the fusion
cross-section.

the DHB densities, even with the inclusion of the excited
states, signiﬁcantly under-predicts the measured cross-
sections, particularly below the barrier. Q-value calcula-
tions of neutron transfer alone are unable to explain the
similarity in cross-section for the closed-shell nuclei and
the enhancement for the open-shell nuclei. If transfer is
the reason for the enhancement, a slightly more expan-
sive perspective is required.

Consideration of the energetics involved with both pro-
ton and neutron exchange, along with Pauli-blocking,
provided insight into the diﬀerence between the closed-
shell and open-shell nuclei. A more quantitative descrip-
tion of the observations requires development of a more
complete theoretical description, one which properly ac-
counts for multi-nucleon transfer and Pauli-blocking in
the initial stages of the collision.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Comparison of the fusion excitation functions for
39,41,45,47K + 28Si and 36,44Ar + 28Si reveals that at
sub-barrier energies the open neutron shell nuclei of
41,45K manifest a signiﬁcantly larger reduced fusion cross-
section as compared to the closed neutron shell isotopes
39,47K.

For the closed-shell nuclei, the use of Dirac-Hartree-
Bogoliubov (DHB) ground state densities in the S˜ao
Paulo fusion model provided a reasonable description of
the data - one that was improved by inclusion of low-
lying states of the 28Si. For the open-shell nuclei, use of
