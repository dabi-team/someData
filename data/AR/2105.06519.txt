ABSTRACT
The aim of this work is to create a long (410 years) series of average annual total sunspot areas
𝐴𝑅 – physically-based index of sunspot activity. We use telescopic observations of the 𝐴𝑅
index in 1832-1868 and 1875-2020, as well as the relationship between 𝐴𝑅 and long series
of sunspot indices 𝑆𝑁 (𝐼 𝑆𝑁 version 2.0) and sunspot groups 𝐺𝑁 (Svalgaard and Schatten
(2016) 𝐺𝑆𝑁 version). The Royal Greenwich observatory series after 1976 is extended by
the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station data. When reconstructing 𝐴𝑅 from 𝑆𝑁, it
is taken into account that the function 𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁) has a non-linear systematic character
and uncertainty associated with the heterogeneity of these indices. Therefore, in addition to
modeling the most probable 𝐴𝑅 values, predictive limits of reconstruction uncertainty are
determined. In the interval 1610-1699 we carried the reconstruction out on the basis of the
𝐺𝑁 series using the previously proposed decomposition in pseudo-phase space method (DPS).
The resulting series NO21y is freely available online. We show that for this series the empirical
Gnevyshev–Ohl rule and Waldmeier eﬀect are fulﬁlled. Wavelet analysis reveals periodicities
of 8.4-13.8 years for the main cycle (with a sharp decrease of the period before the global
Maunder and Dalton minima) and a two-component Gleissberg cycle with typical periods of
50-60 years and 90-110 years.

Key words: Sun: activity – sunspots – photosphere

1 INTRODUCTION

Solar activity is represented by changes in the solar magnetic ﬁeld
at diﬀerent spatial and temporal scales. The most famous and most
tracked in time of its phenomenon is sunspots. They are mentioned
in the chronicle sources of the last 2000 years, and attempts were
made to create time series of solar activity on this basis (Nagovitsyn
2001; Vaquero, Gallego & García 2002).

Telescopic observations of sunspots already cover more than
400 years; however, their systematic observations are fewer in time.
Only since 1848 have Wolf numbers been satisfactorily moni-
tored – now they are called International Sunspot Numbers (𝐼𝑆𝑁).
Through the eﬀorts of Clette et al. (2014), Clette et al. (2015),
Clette & Lefèvre (2016), we have a 320-year series of average an-
nual values of this index (and monthly average values since 1749,
SILSO World Data Center). It is usually called version 2.0, we will
denote them as 𝑆𝑁. Before the article by Clette et al. (2014), re-
searchers used 𝐼𝑆𝑁 version 1.0 as a reference dataset when re-
constructing various indices of solar activity (see, for example,
Nagovitsyn 2008). A comparison of the two versions can be found

in a number of works (see, for example, Georgieva et al. 2017, ﬁg.
2).

Hoyt & Schatten (1998) proposed a series of group sunspot

number (𝐺𝑆𝑁) normalized to the Wolf number:
𝐺𝑆𝑁 = 12.08

′
𝑖𝐺𝑖,

𝑁 Õ 𝑘

(1)

where 𝐺𝑖 is the number of groups observed by the 𝑖th observer,
′
𝑖 is the correction factor for the 𝑖th observer, 𝑁 is the number of
𝑘
observations used to calculate the 𝐺𝑆𝑁. Currently, several versions
of the group sunspot number have been proposed (we will denote
them as 𝐺 𝑁): Svalgaard & Schatten (2016), Usoskin et al. (2016),
Cliver & Ling (2016), and Chatzistergos et al. (2017). The longest
(since 1610) is the Svalgaard & Schatten (2016) version, and we
will use it in our work. It should be borne in mind that the data of
the 17th century are very scattered and obtained with the help of
imperfect tools at that time. Plus, there are scattered light eﬀects,
observation gaps, and peculiar properties of the observers. All this
forces us to treat these data with caution (Nagovitsyn & Georgieva
2017; Karachik, Pevtsov & Nagovitsyn 2019).

Another index of solar activity is the total sunspot area averaged
over a selected period measured in 𝜇𝑠ℎ (millionths of a (visible) so-
lar hemisphere). We will denote this index averaged over a year as
𝐴𝑅. This index is the most physically conditioned in comparison

with the mentioned ones: it is associated with the absolute sunspot
magnetic ﬂux (Nagovitsyn, Tlatov & Nagovitsyna 2016). Another
advantage of the 𝐴𝑅 index is that it weakly depends on the loss
of small sunspots during observations (Nagovitsyn & Georgieva
2017). The most famous and widely used is the Royal Greenwich
observatory (RGO) 𝐴𝑅 series, which existed from May 1874 to
December 1976 (Baumann & Solanki 2005). Several attempts have
been made to continue it. Balmaceda et al. (2009) used data from
observatories of the former USSR in 1977-1985, USAF network
in 1986-2009, and data from observatories in Rome, Yunnan, and
Catania to ﬁll the gaps. Foukal (2014) showed that SOON (USAF
network) data are not the best continuation of the Greenwich se-
ries. Mandal et al. (2020) compiled a continuation of the Green-
wich series after 1976 (we denote this series as MA20) by com-
bining data from the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station
(KMAS), data from the Catalog of Solar Activity by R.S. Gnevy-
sheva (Pulkovo Observatory) and data from the Debrecen Obser-
vatory (Baranyi, Györi & Ludmány 2016) as the closest to RGO
sunspot area measurement systems. In previous works, we used
only KMAS data for the continuation of the RGO series, relying
on the fact that for the monthly mean values in the overlapping in-
terval of RGO and KMAS in 1958-1976 the correlation coeﬃcient
is 𝑟 = 0.992, and the correction factor is 𝑘 = 1.0094 ± 0.0059
(Nagovitsyn, Tlatov & Nagovitsyna 2016). We add to this that for
the same time interval, the average annual values that we will con-
sider in this work correlate with 𝑟 = 0.995, 𝑘 = 1.008±0.015. Based
on this, below we will continue the RGO series after 1976 with the
original KMAS data, as in our previous works. Let us correlate the
series of average annual values MA20 and KMAS in 1977-2019 –
see Figure 1. The correlation coeﬃcient is very high: 𝑟 = 0.9998.
The diﬀerence from 1 of the scaling coeﬃcient 𝑘 = 0.9746± 0.0018
is most likely explained by the fact that Mandal et al. (2020) as-
sumed 𝑘 = 0.98 for the Kislovodsk data in the general series.

Now about the aims of this work. The main task is to compile
the longest series of average annual total sunspot area and to ﬁnd its

possible range of values for diﬀerent time intervals. We will denote
this sought series as NO21y. For this, initially, using the long-term
index 𝑆𝑁 version 2.0 (1700-2020), we will reconstruct the index of
average annual total sunspot areas 𝐴𝑅, the observation period of
which is shorter (from 1874 to 2020). Initially, it is clear that simple
scaling will not help here: the 𝑆𝑁 series describes the numerical
aspect of sunspot formation (the number of spots plus the number
of groups multiplied by 10), and 𝐴𝑅 is associated with a physical
quantity – sunspot magnetic ﬂux. Therefore, their relationship may
be non-linear. Note, for example, that among large sunspots there
are unipolar sunspots with Zurich class H, which can have a fairly
large area. But in the 𝑆𝑁 index H class sunspot will give only 11
units, i.e. the same as for small single spot. Therefore, it is clear
that the dependence 𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁) will also have a random (non-
systematic) spread.

Nevertheless, on the one hand, we can get rid of non-linearity
by statistical methods by compiling an 𝐴𝑅 model based on 𝑆𝑁,
and on the other hand, we can estimate the (natural) uncertainty
intervals of the resulting model associated with the heterogeneity
of the indices. Thus, we need to build an 𝐴𝑅 model with intervals
of uncertainty of its possible values in the past.

Another task: de la Rue, Stewart & Loewy (1870) measured
the areas of the sunspots from sketches by Schwabe, Carrington,
and their own photographic observations, in 1832-1868. Attempts
have already been made to scale these observations into the RGO
system (Vaquero, Gallego & Sánchez-Bajo 2004; Carrasco et al.
2016). Can we suggest a new approach to this procedure? What
are the conﬁdence intervals for such a reconstruction?

Note that Arlt (2008) introduced Staudacher’s observations
over a long time interval from 1749 to 1796 into scientiﬁc circula-
tion. It would be extremely interesting to ‘connect’ these data to the
𝐴𝑅 series. However, the examples of Staudacher’s sunspot sketches
given by Arlt indicate that his observations are too schematic, and
they can hardly be used by us.

11-year solar cyclic variability is characterized by several em-
pirical rules relating the temporal evolution of the solar cycles with
their strengths. These rules are derived from the analysis of obser-
vational data and can be used as constraints for solar dynamo mod-
els (Charbonneau 2020). In this work, we consider two empirical
rules: the Waldmeier eﬀect (Waldmeier 1935, 1939) which relates
the length of the ascending phase of a solar cycle to its maximum
amplitude, and the Gnevyshev–Ohl rule (Gnevyshev & Ohl 1948),
which implies a strong connection between the integral intensities
of an even and the subsequent odd cycles.

2 DEPENDENCE OF AR FROM SN

Figure 2 shows the dependence of the observed 𝐴𝑅 on 𝑆𝑁. The
dotted line is a linear relationship for 𝑆𝑁 < 100. The non-linearity
of the overall relationship is beyond doubt. Therefore, simple scaling
of 𝑆𝑁 to 𝐴𝑅 is not possible.

constructed using the coeﬃcients obtained from the approximation
(2). Carrasco et al. (2016) used monthly averages. In our work, we
will use annual averages.

When determining the coeﬃcients in equation (2), we have
two options. The ﬁrst one is to linearize equation (2), using the
logarithm:
ln 𝐴𝑅 = ln 𝑎 + 𝑏 ln 𝑆𝑁,

ﬁnd the coeﬃcients using the least-squares method (LSM). In this
case, we get
𝐴𝑅 = (4.51 ± 0.30)𝑆𝑁 (1.177±0.016)

the observables 𝐴𝑅∗ = 𝑘 𝐴𝑅, the correction factor 𝑘, and the stan-

The second option is the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm
(Levenberg 1944; Marquardt 1963) (LMA), which allows working
with non-linear equation 2 directly (this method is implemented, in
particular, in the origin package). Applying it, we get:
𝐴𝑅 = (5.18 ± 0.56)𝑆𝑁 (1.149±0.021) ,

Nagovitsyn & Pevtsov (2016) have shown that
the number of large sunspot groups to small ones changes with an
11-year cycle: there are more large sunspot groups at the maximum.
This means that the function 𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁) may depend on the
phase (stage) of the cycle. Therefore, we divide the 𝑆𝑁 dataset into
stages according to the 𝑛 years from the maxima 𝑀 or minima 𝑚:
𝑀 + 𝑛, where 𝑛 ∈ [−3, 5], and 𝑚 + 𝑛, where 𝑛 ∈ [−5, 3]. For each
stage, we will seek its own dependence of 𝐴𝑅 on 𝑆𝑁. Let us choose
equation (9) as the simplest and most linear in terms of the ﬁtting
coeﬃcients. Tables 1 and 2 show the values of the coeﬃcients 𝑐
and 𝑑 of equation (8) for diﬀerent stages of the cycle, as well as
the values of standard deviation 𝑠 and correlation coeﬃcient 𝑟.
We see that the non-linearity of the relationship between 𝐴𝑅 and
𝑆𝑁 manifests itself in diﬀerent ways for diﬀerent stages. It is most
pronounced for stages 𝑀 − 3, 𝑀 + 2, 𝑚 − 5, 𝑚 + 2. For stages
𝑀 − 2, 𝑀, 𝑀 + 4, 𝑚 − 3, 𝑚 − 1, 𝑚, 𝑚 + 1, the function
𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁) is close to linear.

Another formula that can be used to linearize the dependence

of 𝐴𝑅 on 𝑆𝑁 is the polynomial

𝐴𝑅 = 𝑐𝑆𝑁 + 𝑑𝑆𝑁 2

(8)

Since it is linear in terms of coeﬃcients, we apply the LSM,

we get:

𝐴𝑅 = (9.08 ± 0.29)𝑆𝑁 + (0.0114 ± 0.0017)𝑆𝑁 2
𝑟3 = 0.988, 𝑘3 = 1.0007 ± 0.0088, 𝑠3 = 120

(9)

(10)

All three approaches give similar results for the correlation

Now, knowing the stage of activity relative to the extremums,
we can reconstruct 𝐴𝑅 from 𝑆𝑁 for the entire interval from 1700 to
present. In the case of maxima and minima estimates intersection,
we use the weighted average. We will call this reconstruction the
W-version of 𝐴𝑅. Correlating it with the observed values, we ﬁnd:
𝑟4 = 0.990, 𝑘4 = 0.9985 ± 0.0077, 𝑠4 = 106

(11)

Comparing equation (11) with (5), (7), (10) we ﬁnd that the W-
version gets rid of the non-linearity in the function 𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁)
slightly better. The residual standard deviation is 10 per cent less
than in other cases (5), (7), (10).

3 AR IN 1875-2020 – OBSERVATIONAL SERIES IN THE

RGO SYSTEM

Figure 3 is divided into panels A-E according to the type of sunspot
area data available. The gray areas for panels B-E correspond to 95
per cent prediction bands (Chatﬁeld 1993) of the W-version. We
will refer to the ﬁnal dataset obtained in this work as NO21y. Below
we will describe the panels of Figure 3 separately.

Panel E illustrates the alignment of the observed 𝐴𝑅 values
(white circles) with the W-version (gray areas on panels B-E). We
see that the agreement is very good, which is conﬁrmed by the
above-found correlation coeﬃcient 𝑟4 = 0.990.

4 AR IN 1832-1869 – OBSERVATIONAL SERIES BY
SCHWABE, CARRINGTON, AND DE LA RUE

de la Rue, Stewart & Loewy (1870) provide the sunspot areas (av-
eraged over half of a month) for the observations of Schwabe (1832-
1853), Carrington (1854-1860), and their own at the Kew Observa-
tory (1861-1868) (the latter are photographic). Having calculated
the average annual values, let us compare them linearly with the W-
version for the indicated intervals separately, denoting them with
the 𝑆𝐻, 𝐶 𝐴, and 𝐷𝐸 indices according to the ﬁrst two letters of the
names of the observers. We get

𝑟𝑆𝐻 = 0.955, 𝑘𝑆𝐻 = 1.880 ± 0.069, 𝑠𝑆𝐻 = 228
𝑟𝐶 𝐴 = 0.996, 𝑘𝐶 𝐴 = 1.488 ± 0.041, 𝑠𝐶 𝐴 = 86
𝑟𝐷𝐸 = 0.970, 𝑘 𝐷𝐸 = 1.091 ± 0.051, 𝑠𝐷𝐸 = 111

(12)

(13)

(14)

Panel C of Figure 3 shows the data obtained using equations
(12)-(14) together with the W-version. For the NO21y estimate, we
choose 95 per cent conﬁdence bands.

5 AR IN 1700-1831 AND 1869-1874 – W-VERSION

For these time intervals, we can only rely on the W-version when
evaluating 𝐴𝑅. Since the obtained values are, in essence, a predic-
tion of 𝐴𝑅 values, the prediction bands of the W-version should be
used for the estimates of the conﬁdence bands in NO21y.

equal to 7 (Nagovitsyn 2008). As a result, we get a model of 𝑆𝑁
behavior over a longer interval.

First, let us get rid of the non-linearity of the SG and 𝐴𝑅

connection. Comparing these values, we get a new variable:
𝑆𝐺∗ = (151.9 ± 9.0)𝑆𝐺 + (5.7 ± 1.1)𝑆𝐺2

(15)

Using it in the DPS method, we obtain model by the least-squares
method for the interval 1610-1699 (𝑡 is in years):
𝐴𝑅(𝑡) = 11 + 0.907 · 𝑆𝐺∗ (𝑡) + 0.033 · 𝑆𝐺∗ (𝑡 + 3)−
−0.019 · 𝑆𝐺∗(𝑡 + 6) + 0.105 · 𝑆𝐺∗ (𝑡 + 9)+
+0.060 · 𝑆𝐺∗ (𝑡 + 12) − 0.041 · 𝑆𝐺∗ (𝑡 + 15)−
−0.067 · 𝑆𝐺∗ (𝑡 + 18)

(16)

The correlation coeﬃcient of model (16) with the W-version 𝑟 =
0.932, standard deviation 𝑠 = 267. In Figure 3, panel A, the gray
prediction bands are shown at the 95 per cent prediction interval.
Note that the upper limit of the areas in the Maunder minimum
almost corresponds to the average values in the Dalton minimum.
This does not contradict the conclusions of Zolotova & Ponyavin
(2015) on the possibility of non-anomalously low cycle amplitude
in the Maunder minimum. But the cyclicity in the interval of 1660-
1690 is barely expressed.

7 SERIES OF AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL SUNSPOT

AREAS NO21Y IN 1610-2020

Figure 4 shows the NO21y series. In the interval 1610-1699, the
values and prediction intervals (95 per cent prediction bands)
were obtained by applying the DPS method (15)-(16) to the
Svalgaard & Schatten (2016) series. Time intervals 1700-1831 and
1869-1874 correspond to the values and prediction intervals (also 95
per cent prediction bands) of the W-version. The interval 1832-1868
and conﬁdence intervals (95 per cent conﬁdence bands) correspond
to the processed observations of Schwabe, Carrington, and de la
Rue. We assigned zero weights to the RGO series (1875-1976) as
an observational and reference dataset. We took the original values
of the KMAS series in 1977-2020, conﬁdence intervals (95 per cent
conﬁdence bands) were obtained based on the comparison of RGO
and KMAS in 1958-1976.

8 NO21Y SERIES AND EMPIRICAL RULES FOR SOLAR

(2016) SERIES

CYCLICITY

The 𝐺 𝑁 series of Svalgaard & Schatten (2016) contains data on
the sunspot group number since the early 17th century (we will
denote it as 𝑆𝐺). In the second half of this century, it is diﬃcult to
distinguish separate 11-year cycles, if they occur at all. Therefore,
for the reconstruction of 𝑆𝑁 earlier than 1700, we will go the other
way.

In Nagovitsyn et al. (2004), a decomposition in terms of
pseudo-phase space (DPS) reconstruction method was proposed.
It follows from the approach of Takens (1981), who established,
in particular, a relation of dynamical systems with autoregression
models. Without going into the details of the method (it is described
in detail in Nagovitsyn (2008), Nagovitsyn et al. (2008)), we note
that the shorter series (in our case 𝑆𝑁) is decomposed into the com-
ponents of the Takens pseudo-phase space formed by the shifts of
the longer 𝐺 𝑁 series relative to itself by Δ, 2Δ, 3Δ, ..., (𝑛 − 1)Δ. Δ
is chosen near the ﬁrst zero of the autocorrelation function. In our
case, Δ = 3 years. The number of components 𝑛 is usually taken

there are two empirical

Among the regularities of solar cyclicity, as mentioned in the
Introduction,
the Gnevyshev–
Ohl rule (Gnevyshev & Ohl 1948) and the Waldmeier eﬀect
(Waldmeier 1935, 1939). The latter also has a modiﬁed version
(Nagovitsyn & Kuleshova 2012). The rules were originally derived
from a series of International Sunspot Numbers version 1.0. Re-
cently Usoskin, Kovaltsov & Kiviaho (2021) examined them for
modern versions of 𝑆𝑁 and 𝐺 𝑁.

Since we now have at our disposal a new series of 𝐴𝑅 – average
annual total sunspot areas, which seem to be more physically-based
than 𝑆𝑁 and 𝐺 𝑁 – it makes sense to consider the feasibility of these
rules for it.

Since the 1610-1699 interval is problematic (see Figures 3, 4),
we will consider these rules for the 320-year interval from 1700 to
2020.

on the right – conversely, an integral intensity of an odd cycle with
a subsequent even cycle. In the ﬁrst case, the correlation coeﬃcient
is 𝑟 = 0.90, in the second 𝑟 = 0.39. Following the classical work of
Gnevyshev & Ohl (1948), the pair of cycles of the Zurich numbering
4-5 is removed from statistics. Thus, the Gnevyshev–Ohl rule is also
conﬁrmed for the NO21y series: the cycles are physically linked
precisely in the pairs of even and subsequent odd cycles.

Another empirical rule is the Waldmeier eﬀect, which con-
nects the length of the ascending phase of a cycle with the max-
imum cycle amplitude. To accurately determine the length of the
ascending phase from the average annual data, we apply the fol-
lowing technique. Near the extremums of the average annual 𝐴𝑅
value in year 𝑖, values in 𝑖 − 1 and 𝑖 + 1 years are selected, and
an exact parabola passing through these points is constructed us-
ing the Lagrange method. The position of the extremum of this
parabola and the corresponding value of 𝐴𝑅 are considered the
sought ones, and from them, the length of the ascending phase 𝑡
and the height of the cycle at the maximum 𝐴𝑅𝑀 are calculated.
Figure 6a shows the resulting dependence. The linear correlation
coeﬃcient is 𝑟 = −0.77. The correlation is quite low, but it is exists,
and this is typical for the Waldmeier eﬀect, considered for other
indices (Usoskin, Kovaltsov & Kiviaho 2021).

Nagovitsyn & Kuleshova (2012) considered a modiﬁcation of

MNRAS 000, 1–7 (2021)

the Waldmeier eﬀect, namely, the dependence of the maximum cycle
amplitude on the highest rise rate on the ascending phase of a solar
cycle, in this case, Δ𝐴𝑅. Figure 6b shows the resulting dependence,
which, as in the article by Nagovitsyn & Kuleshova (2012), was
approximated by a quadratic polynomial (with the obvious condition
Δ𝐴𝑅 = 0 at 𝐴𝑅𝑀 = 0):
𝐴𝑅𝑀 = (2.98 ± 0.16)Δ𝐴𝑅 − (7.0 ± 1.3) · 10−4 (Δ𝐴𝑅)2,
𝑟 = 0.929

(17)

Thus, the modiﬁed Waldmeier eﬀect for the NO21y series is also
fulﬁlled: the correlation is quite high.

within 8.4-13.8 years. The shortest periods are observed before the
global Maunder and Dalton minima. At the Maunder minimum, the
cyclicity is weakly expressed, but a local decrease in the period in
its middle is observed. The longest period – 13.8 years – is in the
Dalton minimum. At present, the behavior of a period similar to the
one preceding the global minimum is not observed. Apparently, a
decrease in the amplitude of the last cycles will not lead to minima
of the Maunder or Dalton type (see also Hayakawa et al. 2020).

Figure 7 looks interesting in the low-frequency part of the
wavelet spectrum. Instead of the Gleissberg cycle of 80-90 years,
we see a bimodal picture. One of these long cycles lasts 50-60
years, the other 90-110 years. Note that such a bimodal structure
has already been found in other data: Figure 5 in Nagovitsyn (2001)
and Figure 5 in Nagovitsyn et al. (2004).

10 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The average annual total sunspot area index 𝐴𝑅 is physically con-
ditioned in contrast to the ‘statistical’ indices of the relative sunspot
number 𝑆𝑁 and groups 𝐺 𝑁 since it is associated with the sunspot
magnetic ﬂux. Unfortunately, the observed 𝐴𝑅 dataset is much
shorter than 𝑆𝑁 and 𝐺 𝑁. The aim of this work was a long re-
construction of the 𝐴𝑅 series using 𝑆𝑁 and 𝐺 𝑁.

We conﬁrmed that the KMAS data can be used as a continua-

tion of the RGO sunspot areas 𝐴𝑅 dataset after 1976.

It is a priori clear that the dependence 𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁) contains
systematic and ﬂuctuation components. The systematic component
is non-linear (Carrasco et al. 2016). The ﬂuctuation component is
associated with the heterogeneity of the 𝐴𝑅 and 𝑆𝑁 indices: if
𝐴𝑅 reﬂects the magnetic ﬂux of the sunspots, then 𝑆𝑁 reﬂects the
structure and number of sunspots in the active region. Therefore,
it is necessary to correct the non-linearity, and from the scatter of
points between the model and real observations, estimate the range
of possible values of the 𝐴𝑅 series reconstructed from 𝑆𝑁 for times
when there were no 𝐴𝑅 observations.

We show that to correct the non-linearity of the dependence
𝐴𝑅 = 𝑓 (𝑆𝑁), diﬀerent types of functions can be used, but the
best is the dependence that takes into account the stage of the cycle
relative to the extremums. On this basis, we build the so-called
W-version of the 𝐴𝑅, based on the 𝑆𝑁 series version 2.0.

We converted the data of Schwabe, Carrington, and de la Rue
to the RGO dataset system. We found the most probable values and
prediction bands for the average annual total sunspot areas starting
from 1610. The data in the 17th century are estimated since at that
time there were not enough regular observations of solar activity.

The obtained NO21y series demonstrate the feasibility of the
empirical Gnevyshev–Ohl rule and Waldmeier eﬀect starting from
1700.

The wavelet transform skeleton describing the changes in the
local periods of the cyclicity for the NO21y series indicates a de-
crease in the periods before global minima, as well as the bimodality
of the Gleissberg cycle.

We see further development of this work in the compilation of

a long series of monthly average total sunspot areas.
