We calculate the cross-sections of atomic ionization by absorption of scalar particles in the energy
range from a few eV to 100 keV. We consider both nonrelativistic particles (dark matter candidates)
and relativistic particles which may be produced inside Sun. We provide numerical results for atoms
relevant for direct dark matter searches (O, Na, Ar, Ca, Ge, I, Xe, W and Tl). We identify a crucial
ﬂaw in previous calculations and show that they overestimated the ionization cross sections by several
orders of magnitude due to violation of the orthogonality of the bound and continuum electron
wave functions. Using our computed cross-sections, we interpret the recent data from the Xenon1T
experiment, establishing the ﬁrst direct bounds on coupling of scalars to electrons. We argue that
the Xenon1T excess can be explained by the emission of scalars from the Sun. While our ﬁnding
is in a similar tension with astrophysical bounds as the solar axion hypothesis, we establish direct
limits on scalar DM for the ∼ 1 − 10 keV mass range. We also update axio-ionization cross-sections.
Numerical data ﬁles are provided.

The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains an unsolved
problem of modern physics. Current experiments search-
ing for the simplest form of the weakly interacting mas-
sive particles (WIMPs) have exhausted their predicted
parameter space without obtaining unequivocal signals [1–
8]. With experimental tests for supersymmetric theories,
which supply WIMP candidates [9–16], also experiencing
diﬃculties, there is a growing interest in other DM can-
didates, including pseudo-scalars (axions and axion-like
particles [17–32]) and scalars. In particular, the intrigu-
ing excess rate in the recent Xenon1T experiment [33]
was attributed to solar axions (at the 3.5σ level). While
this interpretation remains in tension with astrophysical
bounds [34], here we examine if the scalar particles could
account for the observed Xenon1T excess. Not only we
show that the previous work [35] substantially overesti-
mated the cross-sections of atomic ionization by scalars
and provide cross-section data for a variety of detectors,
we also demonstrate that the Xenon1T excess can be ex-
plained by the emission of scalars from the Sun. While our
ﬁnding is in a similar tension with astrophysical bounds
as the solar axion hypothesis, we establish direct limits
on scalar DM for the ∼ 1 − 10 keV mass range.

Examples of scalars are abundant and include the scalar
familon, the sgoldstino, the dilaton, the relaxon, moduli
and Higgs-portal DM. Among these, the Higgs-portal
scalar DM has become particularly well motivated since
the discovery of the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron
Collider [36]. Detection techniques for ultralight DM
scalars of mass m (cid:28) 1 eV rely on a variety of techniques:
atomic clocks [37–42], resonant-mass detectors [43], ac-
celerometers [44], atomic gravitational wave detectors [45],
laser and maser interferometry [39, 46–48], atom inter-
ferometers [49], pulsar timing and nongravitational lens-
ing [50]. Interactions between heavier scalars and elec-
trons can drive detectable bound-bound transitions in
atomic and molecular systems [51] if their energies match

the transition frequencies. Here we focus on DM scalars
of mass m ∼ O(keV) which can drive bound-continuum
transitions, leading to ionization of atoms. This ioniza-
tion channel contributes to the detection rates of DM
particle detectors. Because DM halo particles are non-
relativistic, ultralight DM scalar candidates can not be
probed directly in particle detectors due to their small
energies. Nevertheless, these detectors may be sensitive to
the ﬂuxes of ultralight scalars produced in the Sun. Solar
scalars may have enough energy to ionize the detector’s
atoms, leading to measurable signals.

In this work we consider the ionization of atoms by
scalar particles. This process was considered alongside
the axioelectric eﬀect in an attempt to explain the signal
modulation observed by DAMA/NaI [35]. It was later
pointed out that Ref. [35] underestimated the axioelectric
eﬀects by several orders of magnitude due to the omission
of the leading term in the axion-electron Hamiltonian [52].
Here, we show that Ref. [35] overestimated the scalar
ionization process by several orders of magnitude due to
the use of electron plane waves which do not obey orthog-
onality conditions to electron bound states. Furthermore,
the calculation in Ref. [35] used a simple model of atoms
which ignored relativistic and many-body eﬀects. As a
result, a relativistic Hartree-Fock (HF) atomic calculation
of the ionization cross section is needed and is performed,
for the ﬁrst time, in this paper. The results of this work
are to be used in the experiments searching for DM and
solar particles using underground detectors.

coupled to an electron ﬁeld ψ may be written in the form

where gφee is a dimensionless coupling constant. We

section may be written in the form

Eq. (3). We ﬁnd that the monopole L = 0 contribution is
suppressed due to the following ‘orthogonality’ arguments.
The integral in the monopole (L = 0) contribution to the
matrix element in Eq. (4) may be presented as

where c is the speed of light, v is the scalar particle’s
velocity in the laboratory frame and a0 ≈ 5.29 × 10−11 m
is the Bohr radius. In standard halo models of nonrel-
ativistic DM, a typical velocity is v ∼ 10−3c. We also
consider the case of ultrarelativistic scalars, which may be
produced in the solar interior. Therefore, in addition to
the nonrelativistic scalar case, we performed calculations
for m = 0. All intermediate cases are between the curves
for the nonrelativistic case and m = 0 case in the graphs
below.

The dimensionless form-factor Q((cid:15)) may be presented as
a multipolar expansion (see the appendix for a derivation)

where α is the ﬁne structure constant, (cid:15)b is the electronic
bound state’s energy, jb its total angular momentum, lb its
orbital angular momentum and κb ≡ (jb + 1/2)(−1)lb+1.
The quantities (cid:15)c, jc, lc and κc are similarly deﬁned for the
continuum state. We assumed that the bound state wave
functions are normalized to unity whereas the continuum
wave functions are normalized to the δ-function of energy,
δ((cid:15)c − (cid:15)(cid:48)
c). Note that the continuum state energy necessar-
ily satisﬁes the energy conservation condition (cid:15)c = (cid:15)b + (cid:15).
The function Π(x) imposes parity selection rules; it re-
turns 1 if x is even and zero if x is odd. The quantity
k = (cid:112)((cid:15)/c)2 − (mc)2/(cid:126) = (cid:15)v/((cid:126)c2) is the wave number
of the scalar particle and jL(...) is the spherical Bessel
function of order L. The summation over L saturates very
rapidly and we cut it at L = 3. The electronic bound and
continuum wave functions needed for the radial integral
in Eq. (4) are calculated using the relativistic HF method.
The HF energies of all core states for several atoms of
interest may be found in the Supplemental Materials.

It is worth emphasizing the failure of the photo-
ionization-derived intuition (see, e.g. [53]) about the rel-
ative importance of various multi-polar contributions to

(cid:15)b
proximation, the ﬁrst term in the right hand side of
Eq. (6) vanishes and the second term is small since
|j0(kr) − 1| ≈ (kr)2/6. For massive nonrelativistic scalar
kr ≈ 0. For massless scalar, kr (cid:28) 1 in the interested
energy range.

Ref. [35] calculated the integral in Eq. (6) in the nonrel-
ativistic electron limit and obtained nonzero result when
j0(kr) ≈ 1. This is because Ref. [35] used, for the out-
going electron, plane waves instead of proper continuum
wave functions, violating the orthogonality condition. As
a result Ref. [35] strongly overestimated the cross section.

incorrect results [54].

The next order term with L = 1 in Eq. (4) is propor-
tional to (cid:82) f κb
rdr which is the same as the radial
(cid:15)b
integral appearing in the photoionization cross section σγ.
For ultrarelativistic scalars, this L = 1 term dominates
over the small L = 0 term and one has (see the appendix)

On the other hand, for massive scalars, the L = 1 contribu-
tion is suppressed, compared to its massless counterpart,

This suppression factor makes the massive L = 1 term
somewhat smaller than the massive L = 0 term.

Using Eq. (7) and experimental data on photoioniza-
tion cross sections [55–57], we performed a test for our
numerical calculations, obtaining agreement within a few
percents accuracy, except for the near the thresholds of
ionization where the diﬀerence is about 10%.

Results - We computed the form-factor Q((cid:15)) in the
expression for the ionization cross section (2) for several
atoms currently used in DM search experiments including
O, Na, Ar, Ca, Ge, I, Xe, W and Tl [2–5, 24, 33, 58–65].
The results are presented in Fig. 2. In our calculations,
correlation corrections and ﬁeld-theoretic eﬀects beyond
the relativistic HF approximation are ignored. The ac-
curacy of this approximation is few percents due to the
dominating contribution from the inner core states. For
these states the correlation corrections are small due to a

strong nuclear ﬁeld. The initial core state is calculated in
a self-consistent potential including all electrons whereas
the ﬁnal electron state in the continuum is calculated in
the potential of the ionized core. We use Eq. (6) to avoid
problems with the orthogonality condition. For energies
above 100 eV, there is practically no diﬀerence between
the results obtained this way and those obtained when
both initial and ﬁnal states are calculated in the same po-
tential. For smaller energies, however, the deviations are
signiﬁcant and use of more accurate potentials combined
with Eq. (6) is important.

We computed the form-factor Q assuming that outgoing
electrons with any nonzero energy are detectable. How-
ever, current experiments can only detect recoil electrons
with energy 1 keV or above (see, for example, Ref. [33]).
Thus, we also computed a reduced factor ˜Q which receives
contributions only from those subshells which give rise
to outgoing electrons with energy at least 1 keV. The
result from this calculation for ˜Q may be directly used
to interpret recent DM search results (see, for example,
Refs. [33, 66]).

It is illustrative to compare the dimensionless factor Q((cid:15))
for the ionization by scalar particle with the dimensionless
factor K((cid:15)) of the axioelectric eﬀect, deﬁned via [67, 68]

events recently recorded by the Xenon1T experiment [33],
whose aim was to detect ionization by solar axion and
DM ALPs, were a result of ionization by scalars.

where σa is the axioelectric cross section and (cid:15)0 = 27.21
eV is the Hartree energy. As shown in Ref. [68], K((cid:15))
is generally the largest when the energy of the incoming
axion is large enough to excite the 1s, 2s and 2p core
electrons. In contrast, one observes from Fig. 2 that Q((cid:15))
generally peaks for sub-keV scalar particles. This fact
may be readily veriﬁed in the case of a massless axion and
a massless scalar particle. Using Eq. (7) and the relation
(see Ref. [52])

σa(ma = 0)/σγ((cid:15)γ = (cid:15)) ≈ (cid:15)2/(2παf 2

a ) ,

(10)

(here (cid:15) is the axion energy ) one obtains

Q(m = 0)/K(ma = 0) ≈ (cid:15)2

0/(2(cid:15)2) ,

(11)

which shows that at high energies Q((cid:15)) is suppressed in
comparison with K((cid:15)). We tested the relation (11) numer-
ically and found agreement within a few percents accuracy.
The numerical data for the form-factor K and its ‘cut-
oﬀ’ version ˜K are also presented in the Supplemental
Materials.

One may now place limits on the electron-scalar cou-
pling constant by assuming, for example, that the excess

where A is the average atomic mass number of the detector
medium and M is the medium’s total mass (A ≈ 131 and
M = 1 ton for Xenon1T). Note that we have used the
‘cutoﬀ’ form factor ˜Q to account for the energy threshold
of the detector, taken to be 1 keV.

The Xenon1T experiment reported an event rate of
about 23.5/(ton × year) at around 2 keV. From the Sup-
plemental Materials, we have ˜QXe((cid:15) = mc2 = 2 keV) ≈
1.94 × 10−3. Substituting these values into Eq. (12), we
ﬁnd that the Xenon1T result is consistent with the value

|gφ¯ee|DM ≈ 8.2 × 10−15 ,

(13)

assuming that it is caused solely by scalar DM. Further-
more, the Xenon1T result may be interpreted as imposing
constraint on |gφ¯ee| for diﬀerent scalar mass. Using the

of the scalar and axion matrix elements. Using Eqs. (7)
and (10), we may write the ratio between the axion and
scalar emission cross sections, and thus the corresponding
ﬂuxes, as

Next, we consider the case where the ionizing scalars are
of solar origin, assuming v ≈ c. Assuming that the dom-
inant mechanisms for producing of solar scalars are the
atomic recombination and deexcitation, Bremsstrahlung
and Compton-like (ABC) processes, one may estimate the
solar scalar ﬂux from solar opacity, as was done for axion

where ga¯ee ≡ 2me/fa. Note that although we derived
Eqs. (7), (10) and (14) for the case of bound-free electron
transitions (ionization or recombination), they also hold
for the cases of free-free (Bremsstrahlung and Compton-
like processes) and bound-bound (deexcitation) transi-
tions.

Ref. [69] gave, for ga¯ee = 10−13, the value Φa

in solar ﬂuxes (see, however, Ref. [34]). Since the ABC
axion solar ﬂuxes can be directly scaled to scalar ﬂuxes,
see Eq. (14), we can draw a similar conclusion: the excess
rate in Xenon1T can be also attributed to the solar scalars.
As Fig. 5 shows this interpretation is also in a similar
tension with current astrophysical bounds. Finally, the
scalar signal may also be detected by looking for diurnal
and annual modulation in the same way as with solar
axion and galactic dark matter.

The wave functions of the electronic bound and contin-
uum states may be presented in the form of Eq. (5). Since
we are interested only in the total ionization cross sec-
tion without regarding to the angular distribution of the
ejected electrons, we may use, for the electronic continuum
states, those with deﬁnite energies and angular momenta.

FIG. 4. Exclusion region for the |gφ¯ee|solar coupling strength as
implied by Xenon1T experiment, assuming that the Xenon1T
signal was caused by ionization by solar scalar.

Let us now compare the limits on gφ¯ee with those placed
by other DM searches and astrophysical observations. For
this purpose, it is useful to convert from gφ¯ee to the
electron mass modulus dme , deﬁned via

√

gφ¯ee =

4πdme me/mP ,

(17)

where mP ≈ 1.22×1019 GeV is the Planck mass. The con-
straint on |dme |DM may be inferred from that on |gφ¯ee|DM
presented in Fig. 3. The constraint on |dme|solar may be
inferred from that on |gφ¯ee|solar at scalar energy 2 keV,
where the Xenon1T signal is the strongest, yielding

|dme |solar ≤ 6.8 × 107 .

(18)

Note that Eq. (18) is independent of the scalar mass m,
subject only to the requirement that mc2 (cid:28) (cid:15) = 2 keV.
In Fig. 5 we plot our constraints on |dme | alongside
with those imposed by other scalar DM searches and
astrophysical considerations. We see that the Xenon1T
limits on |dme |DM and |dme |solar cut deep into the natural
parameter space for a 10 TeV cutoﬀ (the region below the
green line). They are always better than ﬁfth-force limits,
are about an order of magnitude less stringent than the
red-giant cooling limit and are comparable with or better
than horizontal-branch cooling limits.

One source of the observed excess rate in the Xenon1T
experiment was attributed to the solar ABC axions [33].
Although the Xenon1T derived constraints on the axion-
electron coupling strength is a factor of 5-10 weaker than
those from astrophysical analyses, Ref. [33] argues that

[54] We point out that a similar ‘orthogonality’ condition also
exists for the axioelectric eﬀect, aﬀecting the L = 1 multi-
pole, as may be seen in Eq. (A18) in Ref. [68]. For axion
energy of 1 keV and above, as was considered in Ref. [68],
the L = 1 term is subleading and ‘orthogonality’ has no
signiﬁcance. In the sub-eV region, however, it should be
explicitly imposed to avoid numerical inaccuracy. The
existence of the ‘orthogonality’ condition also means that
using free wave functions for the continuum also gives
very wrong results.
