Abstract 
In  this  paper  a  novel  fully  3D,  microfluidic-oriented, 
gel-based  and  low  cost  highly  strechable  resistive 
sensors has been presented.  By the proposed method we 
are able to measure and discriminate all of the stretch, 
twist, and pressure features by a single sensor which is 
the  potential that we  have obtained from the  fully 3D 
structure  of  our  sensor.  Against  to  previous  sensors 
which all have used EGaIn as the conductive material of 
their sensor we have used low-cost, safe and ubiquates 
glycol-based gel instead. To show  the functionality of 
proposed  sensor  some  FEM  simulations,  a  set  of 
designed experimental test were done which showed the 
linear, accurate and durable operation of the proposed 
sensor. Finally, the sensor was put through its paces on 
the knee, elbow, and wrist of a female test subject. Also, 
to  evaluate  the  pressure  functionality  of  the  sensor,  a 
fully  3D  active  foot  insole was  developed, fabricated, 
and  evaluated.  All  of  the  results  show  promising 
features for the proposed sensor to be used in real world 
applications like rehabilitations, wearable devices, soft 
robotics, smart clothing, gait analysis, AR/VR, etc. 

Introduction 
Increasing demand for wearable devices has resulted in 
the development of soft sensors and actuators. There are 
some trending wearable devices like smart fabrics [1, 2] 
and Smart Electro-Clothing Systems [3], sweat sensors, 
[4, 5], artificial skins [6], health monitoring systems [7-
9], and motion capturing devices [10]. Another field that 
has attracted lots of attention is the employment of soft 
sensor  for  the  need  of  virtual  reality  (VR)  and 
augmented  reality  (AR)  systems  [11].  There  are  a 
number  of  applications  for 
including 
immersive entertainment, teleoperation or even physical 
therapy [12]. Being flexible is one of the consequential 
factors in this wearable devices. Due to this reason, the 
field  of  wearable  devices  is  turning  into  using  soft 
sensors.  There  are  numerous  types  of  soft  sensors 
including capacitive soft sensors [13, 14], electroactive 
polymer-based  soft  sensors  [15-18],  and  resistive  soft 
sensors.  Capacitive  sensors  have  shown  the  ability  to 

this  field 

detect  touch  [19-21],  stretch  [22-24],  or  touch  and 
stretch without the ability to distinguish between these 
two [25]. This type of sensor has many advantages but 
also exhibits nonlinear behavior, they are over sensitive, 
and  some  numerical method  is  needed  for  identifying 
the unknown capacitances [26]. The other type of soft 
sensors is electroactive polymer-based (EAP-based) soft 
sensors which are divided into two classes depending on 
the main type of their charge carrier: ionic EAPs [17, 18, 
27-29] and electronic EAPs [30]. These sensors despise 
of having low weight, high sensitivity, biocompatibility, 
and large produced voltage signal have some drawbacks 
as well, like being expensive, slow response, sensitivity 
to moisture and temperature during operation, and their 
operation is also limited to low temperature due to liquid 
electrolyte [30]. The third type of soft sensors is resistive 
soft sensors which are used in this paper. This type has 
promising  features  and  a  better  future  in  comparison 
with other types. It exhibits a linear response and also 
can be fabricated using low-cost materials which allows 
it to be mass-produced. 
Various  fabrication  methods  of  resistive-based  soft 
sensors have also been proposed. Yong-Lae Park et al. 
have  previously 
fabrication  of  a 
hyperelastic pressure sensing resistive-based device by 
embedding  silicone  rubber  with  microchannels  of 
conductive liquid eutectic gallium–indium [31]. Yong-
Lae  Park  et  al.  also  designed  and  fabricated  a  soft 
artificial skin using the previous method but a different 
channel  design  [32].  Mengüḉ  et  al.  have  proposed  a 
design for  a  soft wearable motion-sensing suit  for  the 
application of lower limb biomechanics measurements. 
The  proposed  sensors  are  made  of  silicone  elastomer 
with  embedded  microchannels  filled  with  former 
conductive liquid, EGaIn  [33]. Mengüḉ et al. also use 
the  same  method in  another  paper  to  design  wearable 
soft  sensing  suits  for  human  gait  measurement  [34]. 
Vogt  et  al.  use  the  same  method  and  material  but 
exhibits a novel design [35]. In the mentioned paper a 
soft  multi-axis  force  sensor  was  proposed  that  was 
capable of measuring normal and in-plane shear forces. 
Joseph  T.  Muth  et  al.  have  reported  a  new  method, 
known  as  embedded  3D  printing  (e-3DP),  which 

reported 

the

through  a 
involves  extruding  a  viscoelastic 
deposition nozzle directly into an elastomeric reservoir. 
They  also  used  carbon  conductive  grease,  as  the 
functional ink for patterning sensing elements within the 
3D printed devices [36]. Seokbeom Kim et al. developed 
a stretching and twisting sensor that employs a printing 
method  to  implement  the  desired  pattern  with  EGaIn 
[37].  
As  it  can  be  seen  almost  all  papers  we  reviewed 
previously  were  using  EGaIn  as  their  conductive 
material  which  fills  the  microfluidic  channels  [38]. 
EGaIn shows relatively low toxicity, but this cannot be 
concluded  that  both  ions  are  non-toxic.  Therefore, 
EGaIn  is  reasonably  safe  to  use  in  an  aqueous 
environment, but it should be cautiously handled when 
any mechanical agitation is applied [39]. On the other 
hand, EGaIn is a relatively expensive material. To solve 
this problem, we  use conductive gel  instead of  EGaIn 
which is non-toxic, durable, and inexpensive. Inspired 
by reviewed strategies, we proposed a novel method for 
fabricating  resistive  soft  sensors  which  enables  us  to 
fabricate desired 3D pattern. By making 3D sensors we 
are  able  to  measure  stretch, twist,  and  pressure  at  the 
same time with a single sensor. Yue Zhao et al. also has 
proposed a method for fabricating conductive 3D metal-
rubber 
electronic 
for 
applications  [40].  Furthermore  Kyung-In  Jang  et  al. 
introduced  a 
three  dimensional  network  design 
comprised of helical coils [41]. But these two mentioned 
methods cannot fabricate any desired pattern. The rest 
of the paper consist of four parts, in the second part the 
proposed  method  is  described,  in  the  third  part,  the 
fabrications procedure of  the  proposed soft  3D  sensor 
and the required hardware apparatus will be explained. 
After that in the fourth part, the results are represented 
and a  discussion on  them is done. Finally, in the fifth 
part,  the  main  points  of  the  proposed  sensor  are 
concluded.

Purposed Method  
As  stated previously, the  simplistic nature of  resistive 
sensors enables us to have a definite prediction of their 
behavior. The main idea behind the proposed soft sensor 
is based on measurement the electrical  resistance of a 
conductive  material  when  it’s  geometry  is  changing. 
Theoritaclly when we change the shape of a conductive 
material, it’s electrical resistance will be changed and if 
the  conductive  material  has  geometry  with  all  axis 
components  its  resistance  will  be  change  in  a  broder 
range  and  can  have  more  functionality  facing  with 

external stimulations. Toward these goals first we need 
a  highly  soft  conductive  material  and  second  a  3D 
structure is needed for conductive material to have all 
axis  components  and  broder 
range  of  sensory 
functionality. For this aim we have proposed a technique 
to  make  3D  microfluidic  channels  into  a  highly 
stretchable materials like silicon rubber to have all axis 
components. Now If we fill the 3D microchannel with a 
conductive gel (we call the filled channel as an active 
part), we will have a soft active part that it has an stable 
but  deformable  3D  structure  which  can  response  to 
broder range of mechanical stimulations(Stretch, twist, 
pressure  ,etc)  as  a  highly  stretchable  soft  sensor.  In 
Fig.1(a) an  example of  proposed soft sensor has  been 
illustrated  which  has  tow  individual  active  parts  (W-
Sensor  and  L-Sensor)  for  transverse  and  longitudinal 
measurement  of  mechanical  stimulations.  We  have 
proposed two other structures which will be described in 
the next section but in the rest of this section focusing 
on  this  structure  the  basics  behind  the  behavior  of 
proposed soft sensor are investigated. 
As  our  starting  point  we  pick  the  Pouillet's  law  and 
gradually  reach  a  well  enough  explanation  of  the 
sensor's response and finally by a finite element model 
(FEM) we will show that the proposed idea works and 
has reliable fidelity to reality. 

Theoretical Justification 

As  shown  in  Fig.1(a),  designed  sensors  are  made  of 
various compartments in  different directions, which is 
needed for our purposes. For simplicity, the L- sensor, 
which has long components along the y-axis, has been 
chosen for the rest of the analysis. Furthermore, we can 
apply the same principle to the rest of the sensors due to 
the generalizable argument backing these studies. These 
sensors' core material is made of a conductive gel that 
can be interpreted by its resistivity 𝜌. We can divide this 
sensor  into  its  different  elements  as  𝑛1  identical 
components in the 𝑦-direction with the length of 𝐿1 and 
𝑛2  identical  components  in  the  𝑥 -direction  with  the 
length of   𝐿2.  Now  that we  have  divided the  problem 
into  its  components,  we  can  start  tackling  it  more 
straightforwardly. It can be assumed that 𝑛1 𝑦-direction 
components  and  and  𝑛2   𝑥 -direction  components  are 
connected in series form and so based on the Pouillet's 
law, the net electrical resistance of all components (𝑅𝑇) 
of L-Sensor is as follows: 

𝑅𝑇 = 𝑛1 𝜌1

𝐿1
𝐴1

+ 𝑛2 𝜌2

𝐿2
𝐴2

                (1)

In the proposed designs, the thickness and width of the 
channel  are  the  same  throughout  the  sensor,  and  the 
same  conductive gel  is  presented, so 𝜌 = 𝜌1 = 𝜌2 and 
𝐴1 = 𝐴2 = 𝑡 × 𝑤,  and  the  following  equation  will  be 
obtained: 

𝑅𝑇 = 𝑛1 𝜌

𝐿1
𝑡×𝑤

+ 𝑛2𝜌

𝐿2
𝑡×𝑤

               (2)

Where t and w are thickness and width respectively. We 
can  assumed  that  for  a  fixed  volume,  the  𝛼  times 
elongation  in  any  direction  leads  to  an 𝛼 times  cross-
section shrinkage and √𝛼 times t and w shrinkage which 
it can be formulated as follows: 

𝐹𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 = 𝐿  × 𝐴  → 𝑖𝑓  𝐿′ =  𝛼𝐿  →  𝐴′

Any stretch along the y-direction will result in the same 
situation for the y -oriented components, although there 
is more complexity for the x -oriented ones. If they were 
situated at  the middle of  the sensor, we  could assume 
with  confidence  that  the  channel's  width  will  stretch 
with  the  same  factor, which  is  not  the  case  here.  The 
amount of width elongation for those channels depends 
on  one  more  factor:  the  properties  of  the  flexible 
material.  First,  we  assume  that  the  width  of  the  x -
oriented  channels  will  stretch  by  a  factor  of 𝛽 so  the 
equation (2) becomes: 

𝑅𝑇

′ = 𝑛1 𝜌

                 (4)       

Where 𝑛2 =  𝑛1 − 1 and consequently we have :

(5)                

In the specific sensor that is chosen for this analysis (L-
Sensor), the length of 𝐿1 is far less than of 𝐿2 (50 times), 
and  the 𝛽  is  near 𝛼  as  stated  before,  so  it  is  safe  to 
assume those terms negligible and omit them, hence the 
approximated  version  of  equation  (5)  is  obtained  as 
equation (6)  : 

′ =

𝑅𝑇

𝑛1𝜌𝐿1
𝑡×𝑤

 𝛼2   

(6)

It is inferred from equation (6) that the output signal of 
the  specific  sensor  is  a  2nd-degree  function  of  the 
𝛼 stretch factor. The same logic can be applied to any 
other  sensors  that  consist  of  groups  of  the  same 
components situated in different orientations. However, 
it is crucial to consider that not in every sensor can we 
have the last assumption of negligible length ratios. So 
the relation will deviate more from the equation (6).  

In  the  last  section,  we  derived  a  somewhat  nonlinear 
relation  between  the  output  resistance  and  𝛼   stretch 
factor. To test our analysis and complex outputs of the 
sensors, the dual-stage sensor in Fig.1(a) was simulated 
in COMSOL. To achieve a more realistic response from 
the simulation, a  simple experiment was  conducted to 
determine the relationship between the increased length 
and  the  shrunk cross-section. The  diagram in  Fig.1(c) 
shows  how  the  experimental  data  is  following  the 
theoretical  assumption.  The  mentioned  experimental 
data were used to generate a set of different thicknesses, 
lengths,  and  widths  and  fed  to  the  COMSOL  as 
parameters.  Then,  in  each  set  of  parameters  that 
determined the sensor's mechanical state, resistance was 
calculated using  a  1Khz  sinusoidal  wave.  Finally,  the 
results were  fed  to  MATLAB  for post-processing and 
ratio calculations. It can be seen from Fig.1(b) that the 
mentioned sensors have a second degree behavior which 
will translate to a more linear characteristic due to the 
small amount of displacement in real life applications. 
Although,  it  is  evident  that  the  W-sensor  has  more 
nonlinearity due  to  the more visible nonlinear term in 
equation (5).

 At this stage, a sinusoidal and Pulse shape mechanical 
wave  was  generated  to  show  the  L  and  W  sensor's 
functionality, shown in Fig.2. These examples show that 
the output electrical signals of the proposed sensors are 
highly  correlated to  the  input  mechanical  stimulations 
and so the sensor can work linearly. In the section four 
we will validate the response of the proposed sensor by 
variety of experimental tests.

Fabrication  procedure  and  Hardware 
appartus 
The  fabrication  steps  for  the  sensor  prototype  are 
represented  in  Fig.3.  First,  the  mold  and  scaffold  are 
prepared  by  3D  printing.  We  used  Acrylonitrile 
is  a  common 
Butadiene  Styrene  (ABS)  which 
thermoplastic polymer as the printing material. Also to 

prevent the soft material from excessive adhesiveness to 
the mold, the silicone-oil spray is used as a lubricant, so 
it can be peeled off easily from the mold. After that, the 
printed scaffold pattern is  inserted into  the  mold. The 
Ecoflex 00-30 which is a type of silicon rubber, liquid 
elastomer, is used as soft material. After preparation of 
Ecoflex  and  placing  it  in  the  desiccator  to  expel 
remaining bubbles, it is poured into the mold. Then it is 
placed on a hot plate and heated to 120° until Ecoflex is 
cured.  The  curing  time  is  about  20  minutes  which 
depends on the thickness of the sensor. After peeling off 
the  chip  from  the  mold,  it  will  be  submerged  into 
acetone. By doing this, the acetone vapor dissolves the 
ABS,  and  the  3D  micro-channels  are  created  into  the 
Ecoflex. In this step, the sensor is ready and can be filled 
with conductive gel, but because of the high elongation 
of the Ecoflex, the contact wires may not be fixed in the 
channel so we have used another material for the clamp 
region.  Thus,  after  removing  ABS  from  the  chip,  the 
clamp region is cut, and the chip is put in the mold again 
and the clamp region is filled with  Dragon Skin™ 30 
silicon  rubber,  again.   Dragon  Skin™  30  has  lower 
elongation in comparison with Ecoflex, as the result, this 
ensures  that  the  wires  are  well  anchored  in  the  soft 
sensor. After the chip has peeled off to avoid unwanted 
bubbles into the gel the channels are filled out using a 
designed syringe pump with the range of mL/min flow 
rate. Finally, Electrical connections which are made of 
thin wires will be inserted in each reservoir.

Fig.4  shows  different  sensors  for  measuring  different 
forces like tension, pressure, and twist. In each of these 
sensors, we designed two types of sensors. The first one, 
which we named ‘W-Sensor’ has maximum sensitivity 
for transverse force. Another one which we named ‘L-
Sensor’  has  maximum  sensitivity  for  Longitudinal 
force.  Fig.4(a)  illustrates  the  first  sensor  which  has  a 
planar  structure.  Fig.4(b)    shows  the  second  sensor 
which is designed in a double-stage structure in which 
the  thickness  of  the  channels  changes  linearly  in 
opposite directions of eachother, means the thickest part 
of the L-Sensor is where the W-Sensor is in its thinnest 
part and vice versa. And finally, the third sensor Fig.4(c) 
is designed fully 3D which has a trapozoidal shape in 
side view. 

video will be converted into an image sequence. Then 
images will turn into BW images by using a threshold 
that keeps the black points and removes other objects in 
the picture. In  stretch setup, the distance between two 
black  points  will  be  calculated  using  morphological 
transforms and  other necessary computations. In  twist 
setup, the sensor's twisting angle can be calculated via 
the position of black point in the camera's view using the 
same  image  processing  tools.  Here  we  obtained  the 
length of displacement for stretch setup and the angular 
displacement  for  twist  setup.  After  that  the  electrical 
signal and the mechanical signal were synchronized by 
an LED, they could be easily coupled, and by use of the 
coupled signal, the transform function of the following 
sensor could be obtained as well.

Hardware appartus  

Fig. 5(a) shows the hardware setup flowchart for testing 
the  response  of  proposed  sensors  to  the  applied 
mechanical  signals  such  as  stretch  and  twist  with 
different  waveforms.  There  is  two  setup  designs  for 
stretching and twisting the sensors, shown in Fig. 6(a) 
and  Fig.  6(b),  repectively.  With  the  aid  of  a  stepper 
motor  as  a  mechanical  power  source,  the  sensor  was 
stretched  or  twisted  from  one  stage  to  another. 
Furthermore,  a  camera  was  used  for  capturing 
mechanical  stress  applied  to  the  sensor  using  image 
processing  methods,  while  an  electrical  setup  was 
logging  impedance  of  the  sensor  under  the  test.  The 
flowchart of  the  whole  image processing procedure is 
shown  in  Fig.  5(c).  For  obtaining  the  exact  length  of 
stretch  and  angle  of  twist  with  image  processing,  we 
need two black points on each side of the sensor for the 
stretch setup, shown in Fig. 6(a), and a stick with a black 
point on its head placed at the end of the sensor for twist 
setup, shown  in  Fig.  6(b). In  each setup, the captured

hardware configuration flowchart for measuring the response

the  electrical  setup  used  to  obtain  and  record  the  sensor's 
impedance.  (c)  Flowchart  of  utilizing

During  the  experiment,  the  sensor  was  subjected  to  a 
series of mechanical signals such as Sinusoidal, Ramp, 
Pulse, and PRBS. All of these triggers were used in both 
the  stretch  and  twist  experiments  (Fig.  6(a)  and  Fig. 
6(b)). The mechanical signals were produced by varying 
the  speed  of  the  stepper  motor.  Fig.  5(a)  depicts  the 
flowchart of the electrical setup used to acquire and log 
the  impedance  of  the  sensor.  First,  an  AC  signal  was 
applied to an AC voltage divider consisting of the sensor 
and a Resistor. Then, due to handling the loading issue, 
the output of the voltage divider was buffered and then 
was  fed  to  a  50Hz  Notch  filter  to  reject  city  power 
interference.  After  that,  the  output  was  a  clear  AC 
waveform. Because the change in the impedance of the 
sensor would lead to the change in the amplitude of the 
AC  waveform, a peak detector was used to obtain the 

5 

 
 
 
 
amplitude of the signal. In the end, an Analog-to-Digital 
Converter was used to convert the analog signal to the 
computer, and then it was sent to the computer by serial 
communication. An STM32F103 microcontroller which 
has a 12-bit ADC was used to convert the analog signal 
to digital and send it to the computer.

capabilities. 

stimulations have been used to achieve a thorough and 
proper analysis of their behavior, and the variation in the 
impedance was  recorded. Responses to  the  Sinusoidal 
and Ramp signals are shown in Fig. 7(a,b) and in Fig. 
7(c),  respectively,  indicating excellent performance in 
the  devised  circumstances.  In  order  to  test  the  output 
response to a broad range of frequencies, a mechanical 
pulse with a fixed frequency and a pseudorandom binary 
sequence  (PRBS)  was  generated.  As  shown  in  Fig. 
7(d,e), the electrical signal is effortlessly following the 
input  mechanical  stimulation.  It  can  be  inferred  that 
these  sensors  are  capable  of  handling  high-speed 
situations as efficiently as low frequencies. Finally, to 
discern  complex  motions  and  explicate  the  promising 
capabilities of  these  flexible sensors, a  more  complex 
mechanical stimulation was devised. In this experiment, 
sensors were twisted at  90 degrees with the shape of a 
PRBS wave. As shown in Fig. 7(f), the output signal is 
well enough explanatory and shows a good following of 
the input signals. To distinguish the proper behavior of 
the mentioned sensors in this experiment, more complex 
data analysis techniques like machine learning and deep 
learning  algorithms  are  required,  which  will  be 
investigated thoroughly in future researches.

Characterization tests 
As  stated  in  the  theoretical  justification  section,  the 
behavior of these flexible sensors is of the second degree 
with  some  considerations.  Due  to  the  small  enough 
changes along each direction of the sensors in real-world 
applications,  it  is  expected  to  have  a  near-linear 
behavior that is a massive advantage in data analysis and 
predictability.  

Fig.  8:  The  Characterization  diagrams  of  each  of  the  three 
sensors for both (a) L and (b) W compartments. 

To  test  this  hypothesize,  the  acquired  data  in  the 
previous  experiments  were  used 
to  generate  a 
characterization  diagram  of  each  of  the  three  main 
sensors for both  L and W compartments, shown in Fig. 
8.  These  diagrams  and  calculated  R2  show  that  the 
fabricated sensors have excellent linear behavior, which 
was expected from the results of previous experiments 
with sinusoidal and ramp signals. 

Durability tests 

If  we  want  to  use  the  the  sensors  in  the  practical 
application besides the linearity feature they should also 
have  high  level  of  durability.  The  linearity  of  the 
proposed  sensor  was  investigated  in  the  previous 
section,  here  we  want  to  explaine  that  the  proposed 
sensor is durable enough to be used in real applications. 
In  order  to  test  the  durability  of  our  sensor  a  4-hour 
experiment  was  designed  in  which  the  sensor  was 
subjected  to  stretching  back  and  forth  sinusoidally 
continually in whole of four hours. The results can be 
seen in Fig.9 which sensors’ performance has not seen 
a considerable change in this period of time and this fact 
demonstrates  that  the  purposed  sensor  is  thoroughly 
durable.

Real-world applications 

Finally, to test the real-world applications of these kinds 
of sensors, four different experiments were conducted. 
First,  a  female  subject  was  asked  to  integrate  sensor 
number  one  on  her  knee  and  tasked  with  specific 
movements,  which  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.10(a) 
and Fig.10(d1). Then the same procedure was used to 
test the same sensor on a different part of the body as 
elbow Fig.10(b) and Fig.10(d2). The same subject was 
asked  to  do  specific  movements  on  her  elbows  to 
demonstrate  another  application  of  these  sensors  as  a 
therapies  or 
measurement 

in  physical 

system 

performance measurements. Finally, to conclude a set of 
complete movements, the same sensor was placed on the 
subject's  wrist  and  asked  to  follow  a  set  of  motions 
which included the twist and bending motion, and the 
results  are  shown  in  Fig.10(c).  As  you  can  see  in 
Fig.10(a,b,c) the proposed sensor is able to measure the 
movement  of  the  joints  like  knee,  elbow,  wrist  etc 
accurately  and  also  it  is  abale  to  detect  complex 
movement like twist of wrist, neck , etc. These results 
can assure us the proposed sensor has enough potential 
to be used in real work applications like rehabilitations, 
wearable  devices,  soft  robotics,  smart  clothing,  gait 
analysis, motion capture, AR/VR, etc. 

Fig. 10: Practical results of using the sensor in real-world applications (a) Output signals of Knee movements such as (a-l) moving the 
knee sinosoidally with variant theta of 180 to 90, (a-ll) keeping the knee straight, (a-lll) bending the knee at 𝜽 = 𝟏𝟑𝟓°  and also (a-lV) 
bending the knee till = 𝟗𝟎° . (b) Output signals of elbow movements such as (b-l) moving the elbow sinosoidally with variant theta of 
180 to 90, (b-ll) keeping the elbow straight, (b-lll) bending the elbow at 𝜽 = 𝟏𝟑𝟓°  and also (b-lV) bending the elbow till 𝜽 = 𝟗𝟎°  (c) 
Output  signals of  wrist movements  including  (c-l)  twist and  (c-ll)  bending  motion.  (d)  real images  of  testing  the  proposed sensor  on 
subject’s  (d-1)  knee  and  (d-2)  elbow.  (e)  the  whole  3D  fabricated  foot  insole:  (e-1)  real-world  image  of  the  insole  (e-2)  the  pressure

At  last,  one  of  the  distinctive  features  of  fabricated 
sensors was put to the test. The novel fabrication method 
used  in  this  paper  made  it  possible  to  fabricate three-
dimensional channels that translate to another degree of 
freedom in sensing applications. As shown in Fig.4(c) it 
is plausible to produce various gradients to grasp a better 
sense of direction in these sensors and design them for 
specific purposes. Using Fig.4(c) as a reference, a whole 
active foot insole was fabricated using the same material 
used  as  before  integrated  with  sixteen  3D  sensors 
Fig.10(e1).  These  sensors  are  able  to  measure  the 
amount  of  pressure  applied  to  them  due  to  the  3D 
structural nature they have. Furthermore, because of the 
designed gradients in height throughout the foot insole 
plane,  it  is  feasible  to  discern  the  points  of  pressure, 
which all are due to the extraordinary capabilities that 
the  new  fabrication  method  brought  with  itself.  The 
shown diagram in Fig.10(e2) until Fig.10(e5) explains 
the excellent pressure pinpoint ability of the active foot 
insole that can  be  utilized to  screen specific problems 
such as flat feet and improper walking forms in children. 
Fig.10(e2) shows the pressure gradient graph when the 
foot  puts  pressure on  all  parts  of  the  insole  normally. 
Fig.10(e3) depicts the situation where the foot puts more 
pressure on  the  side  of  the  insole and  also  Fig.10(e4) 
illustrates  the condition when  the  foot  presses  against 
the ankle. Finally Fig.10(e5) shows a posture in which 
the foot presses against the forefoot. 

Conclusion 

this  paper  a  novel  approach  for  fully  3D, 
In 
microfluidic-oriented, gel-based and low cost resistive 
soft sensors was proposed.  By the proposed method we 
are able to quantify and discriminate all of the stretch, 
twist, and pressure features by a single sensor. To show 
the  functionality  of  proposed  sensor  first  the  basic 
physics  behind  this  resistive  sensor  was  inevestigated 
using  FEM  simulations.  Second  a  set  of  designed 
experimental test  were  done.  During  the  experimental 
tests, the sensor was subjected to a series of mechanical 
signals  such  as  Sinusoidal,  Ramp,  Pulse,  and  PRBS 
which all showed  the  linear and  accurate operation of 
the sensors. Also, During a 4-hour length experiment the 
durability of the purposed sensor was proofed. Finally, 
the sensor was put through its paces on the knee, elbow, 
and wrist of a female test subject. Also, to evaluate the 
pressure  functionality  of  the  sensor,  a  complete  3D 
active foot insole was developed and fabricated, and the 
results were displayed using a gradient graph of the foot. 

These  results  can  assure  us  the  proposed  sensor  has 
enough  potential to  be  used  in  real  work  applications 
like  rehabilitations,  wearable  devices,  soft  robotics, 
smart clothing, gait analysis, motion capture, AR/VR, 
etc.
