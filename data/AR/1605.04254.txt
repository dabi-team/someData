Ongoing experimental progress in the preparation of ultra-clean graphene/superconductor (SC)
interfaces enabled the recent observation of specular interband Andreev reﬂections (AR)1 at bilayer
graphene (BLG)/NbSe2 van der Waals interfaces [Nature Physics 12, (2016)2]. Motivated by this
experiment we theoretically study the diﬀerential conductance across a BLG/SC interface at the con-
tinuous transition from high to ultra-low Fermi energies EF in BLG. Using the Bogoliubov-deGennes
equations3 and the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism4 we derive analytical expressions for the
diﬀerential conductance across the BLG/SC interface. We ﬁnd a characteristic signature of the
cross-over from intra-band retro- (high EF ) to inter-band specular (low EF ) ARs, that manifests
itself in a strongly suppressed interfacial conductance when the excitation energy |ε| = |EF | < ∆
(the SC gap). The sharpness of these conductance dips is strongly dependent on the size of the
potential step at the BLG/SC interface U0.

INTRODUCTION

Andreev reﬂections1 (AR) at normal metal (N) to
superconductor (SC) interfaces describe the non-trivial
conversion of a normal dissipative current into a dissipa-
tionless supercurrent. When an electron from N is in-
jected onto a SC with an excitation energy |ε| < ∆ (the
SC gap), it is reﬂected back as a hole with an exactly op-
posite direction of motion. This perfect retro-reﬂection
process is understood as the result of the quasi-elasticity
and momentum conservation of the process, combined
with the fact that the hole has a negative mass. This
picture is however only an approximation5. Due to a
small energy loss of the electron due to its condensation
into a cooper pair, the holes energy and in-plane momen-
tum, and hence its angle of reﬂection, are in all generality
smaller than that of the incident electron. This eﬀect is
exceedingly small in typical metallic systems where EF
strongly exceeds typical energies of ∆, and perfect retro-
AR in these systems has been conﬁrmed in great detail6.
Recent experimental eﬀorts however shifted towards
more exotic materials such as semi-conductors7, topo-
insulators8, quantum Hall systems9, carbon-
logical
nanotubes10 and graphene2,11. Unlike typical metals,
these can have much lower EF where the retro-reﬂection
process can be dramatically altered. Single (SLG) and bi-
layer graphene (BLG)12,13 with their semi-metallic band-
structure and the continuous gate tunability of EF are
uniquely suited to study the EF dependence of ARs at
the cross-over from large to arbitrarily small EF . In the
recently achieved regime where |EF | < ∆2, the reﬂected
hole can undergo an inter-band transition from the con-
duction into the valence band, causing the holes mass
to change its sign. Under these conditions, energy and
momentum conservation dictate that the reﬂection angle
becomes a non-trivial function of EF , resulting in a spec-

ular AR process for EF = 0 where the angle of incidence
and reﬂection are equal α = α′ (Fig.1 (a) and (b)).

In this paper we work out a detailed analytical descrip-
tion of the diﬀerential conductance across a BLG/SC in-
terface at the continuous transition from high |EF | ≫ ∆
to low |EF | < ∆ Fermi energies. While direct measure-
ments of scattering angles are experimentally challeng-
ing, measurements of a non-linear conductance GN S(ε)
as a function of the excitation energy ε are easily experi-
mentally approachable and can illuminate the underlying
scattering processes at the N/SC interface. We ﬁnd two
distinct regimes for |ε| < |EF | and |ε| > |EF | where intra-
band retro-reﬂections and inter-band specular-reﬂection
are taking place, respectively. We identify conductance

 
 
 
 
 
 
dips in GN S(ε) at the energy condition |ε| = |EF |, where
the hole is reﬂected onto the charge neutrality point. This
line in the energy phase space separates the two distinct
regimes, so marking the cross-over from retro intra-band
to specular inter-band AR.

II. MODEL AND METHOD

We model the BLG/SC junction considering a setup
similar to the one presented in the experimental device
of Ref.2, and similar to the one used in the theoretical
model in Ref.5 (Fig. 1 (a)). We assume an impurity free
BLG sheet in the half plane x > 0 that has an ideal elec-
trical contact with a SC lead at x < 0. The SC is mod-
eled by a BLG sheet with an induced SC gap ∆ (x) that
appears due to the SC proximity eﬀect. For a more real-
istic BLG/SC interface we also assume that the SC con-
tact induces an additional potential U (x) due to work-
function matching of the BLG and the SC, as it is typi-
cally observed for all graphene/metal interfaces. Assum-
ing that only singlet SC is induced and that only electrons
of diﬀerent valleys form Cooper pairs in the BLG, we
write the Bogoliubov-deGennes (BdG) equations3 that
describe the electron motion in the system in the stan-
dard form

This potential proﬁle is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation,
since in the experiment these quantities can scale rather
smoothly at the interface. While our assumption may
result in a certain overestimation of the transmission am-
plitude at the interface, we do not think that the depen-
dence of the conductance on EF and ε can essentially be
diﬀerent for a smoothed potential step, and believe that
this approximation should not change the basic picture
of the conversion from retro- to specular ARs.

In accordance with the experimentally known param-
eters, we assume that the potential U0 is larger than the
energies EF , ∆0 and ε but the largest energy in BLG is
the coupling energy ℏvt⊥ between the layers. Therefore
we use the inequalities

ℏvt⊥ ≫ U0 ≫ EF , ∆0, ε.

(2.6)

Here we want to speciﬁcally point out that the inequal-
ities (2.6) are diﬀerent from those used in Ref.17, which
leads to quite diﬀerent approximations and ﬁnal results.
One can calculate the diﬀerential conductance GN S(ε)
for |ε| < ∆0 and T = 0 by considering the scattering of
particles that are moving from right to left. Following
the formalism of Ref.4 one can solve the equations (2.1-
2.6) separately for x > 0 and x < 0, then match these
solutions at x = 0, and so ﬁnd the normal reﬂection
r(ε, α) and Andreev reﬂection rA(ε, α) amplitudes for all
incidence angles α

Such a calculation is not very diﬃcult for SLG5, how-
ever a corresponding calculation for BLG is considerably
more cumbersome and it is not easy to obtain explicit for-
mulas in all regions of the variables ε and EF . Here we
follow Beenakkers approach18 that allows one to express
the conductance GN S(ε) in terms of transmission t(ε)
and reﬂection r(ε) amplitudes of the scattering on the
interface between two normal metals, by simply putting
∆0 = 0. We write the diﬀerential conductance GN S(ε)
in the form :

In other words, Eq.

where regions 1 and 2 correspond to N (x > 0) and SC

(2.8-2.10)
show that calculating the transmission t12(ε), t21(ε), and
reﬂection r12(ε), r21(ε) amplitudes (see Appendix) for
right and left moving particles at the interface one ob-
tains the diﬀerential conductance GN S(ε) of the BLG/SC
interface. The trace T r over the scattering channels in
Eqs. (2.8, 2.10) reduces to the integration over the mo-
mentum q parallel to the interface. Eqs. (2.8-2.10) also
demonstrate that, in order to calculate the diﬀerential
conductance GN S, it is enough to understand the scat-
tering on the interface between two normal metals, which
is a considerably simpler task than calculating the diﬀer-
ential conductance using the original formula (2.7).

Generally, one can see from Eqs.

(2.8, 2.9) an im-
portant diﬀerence between the conductance of SLG and
that of BLG. For SLG the energy spectrum follows the
Dirac equations and hence the transmission amplitude
for an electron is of order one for any U0 due to the so
called Klein eﬀect. In contrary, the spectrum of BLG is
approximately quadratic and one can conclude by using
standard formulas19 for scattering on a step function that
the transmission amplitude t12(ε) decays proportionally
to U
at large U0 and therefore is very small. For this
reason, while the conductance GN N in BLG is propor-
tional to t2, the conductance GN S is proportional to t4,
and hence can be much smaller than GN N . The presence
of the SC gap can therefore strongly reduce the conduc-
tance across the interface.

ever, it is even more convenient to integrate over the
incident angle α. The angle α corresponds to the energy
ε, while the reﬂection angle α′ corresponds to the energy
−ε. These angles are related to each other by the condi-

We have to speciﬁcally distinguish between two

distinct regimes :

C. Conductance GNN of the interface between two

The transmission amplitude t12 (ε) determines the zero
temperature conductance GN N (ε) between two normal
metals entering Eq. (2.10). At a ﬁxed EF the conduc-
tance GN N (ε) is given by the following formula

The conductance GN S (ε) is then determined as before

the results of the present Section can be found in Ap-
pendix.

IV. NUMERICAL STUDY AND DISCUSSION

In the AR process the incident electron has a total
energy of EF + ε and condenses into a Cooper pair with
a total energy of 2EF after transmission into the SC.
Here energy conservation dictates that the reﬂected hole
has a slightly lower total energy of EF − ε. This energy
loss of 2ε can have dramatic consequences for an ultra-
low EF , where for the condition |ε| > EF , the incident
conduction hole electron can be reﬂected as a hole in the
valence band (Fig. 1 (a) and (b).

Due to momentum conservation parallel to the inter-
face q, the reduced energy of the hole directly translates
into an altered angle of reﬂection α′ as compared to the
angle of incidence α. As was shown in the previous sec-
tion, these angles are related to each other by the simple
relation (3.1) from which one can conclude that ARs are
only possible for angles α < αc, where αc, Eq.
(3.2),
plays the role of the angle of total internal reﬂection for
ARs and is plotted in Fig. 2 (a) for various ﬁxed EF . As
can be seen from the plots, for ε = 0, αc = π/2, and ARs
are possible for all angles of incidence. However when
ε = EF , αc = 0, and AR are prohibited for all angles.

The explicit analytical formula for GN S, Eq. (3.5), and
subsequent formulas for the functions entering this equa-
tion allows us to numerically calculate GN S(ε, EF ) for
the full phase space. Here we explicitly calculate the nor-
malized conductance, GN S(ε, EF )/GN N (ε, EF , T ), since
this allows to better highlight the conductance features
that arise solely from the SC proximity eﬀect. As both
GN S and GN N in a realistic sample are generally sub-
jected to eﬀect of energy ﬂuctuations and disorder, one
can eliminate these undesired and hard to quantify eﬀects
by simply dividing these out. Since measurements of the
2, one can use
SC state are typically performed at T ≪ Tc
GN S(ε, EF ) at T = 0, with a reasonable accuracy. How-
ever, we speciﬁcally derive a temperature broadened form
of GN N (ε, EF , T ) since in an experiment one can only
obtain this quantity at elevated temperatures T > Tc

In Fig. 2 (b) we plot out GN S/GN N (10K) (here we
choose T = 10K for GN N as was used in Ref.2) as a func-
tion of ε for various ﬁxed EF . Since αc = 0 for |ε| = |EF |,
it can be seen from Eq. (3.5) that the conductance van-
ishes, GN S = 0, at these points. As discussed earlier, this
condition coincides exactly with the condition that sep-
arates intra-band retro- from inter-band specular reﬂec-
tions. The depleted interfacial resistance for this energy
condition marks therefore the cross-over between the two
diﬀerent regimes, and so provides a strong experimen-
tal observable. In Fig. 2 (c) we plot a 2D colormap of
GN S/GN N for a function of both ε and EF . The con-
ductance dips scale along the diagonal lines deﬁned by
the condition |ε| = |EF | and deﬁne a striking cross-like

The integrand in Eqs.

(2.8, 3.5) contains only one
unknown parameter, the potential step at the BLG/SC
interface U0 (in Fig. 2 we used a U0 = 5meV). In prin-
ciple, this value can be found in literature for various
materials or can be extracted by ﬁtting the experimental
curves with the presented theory.
In general, it is im-
portant to emphasize the role of U0 for the purpose of
In
experiments, as it can strongly aﬀect the outcome.
Fig. 3 we study the normalized conductance GN S/GN N
for various values of U0. One can see that the inner gap
conductance is strongly reduced for higher values of U0.
This results in the strong suppression of the sharpness
and contrast of the characteristic cross-over point from
retro- to specular ARs, EF = ε. This suppression can
be explained by the previously discussed decaying trans-
mission amplitude t12(ε) which scales proportionally to
and is therefore very small for large U0. For ex-
U
perimental studies of specular AR in BLG/SC junctions
it is therefore important to engineer an interface with a
rather small potential step U0.

V. CONCLUSIONS

where

In this manuscript we have rigorously worked out ana-
lytical expressions for the diﬀerential conductance across
a BLG/SC interface for the ultimate limits of large and
small Fermi energies EF . We have found, that while for
EF ≫ ∆ the AR process is described by intra-band retro-
reﬂections, in the limit of EF ≪ ∆ they are described
by inter-band specular-reﬂections. From numerical cal-
culations we ﬁnd that the cross-over between the two
processes has a clear experimental signature that man-
ifests itself in a strongly suppressed interfacial conduc-
tance when the excitation energy |ε| = |EF | < ∆.

Provided the interlayer coupling t⊥ exceeds all the

the spectra E1 (k) and E3 (k) are far away from the Fermi

component vectors u that satisfy the equation

Equations (2.8-2.10) allow one to reduce the calcula-
tion of the conductance of the N/SC junction to study of
the transmission and reﬂection amplitudes between two
normal metals. This can be done putting ∆ = 0 in Eqs.
(2.1-2.3) and writing the obtained equation in the form :

(H (k) − EF ) u = εu.

(7.5)

Here we consider only the case EF > 0. The solu-
tions depend on the sign of ε + EF and we write them
separately for ε + EF > 0 and ε + EF < 0.
For the low-lying eigenvalues we obtain

H0( ˆK) + U (x)
(cid:17)

(cid:16)

u = Eu,

(7.1)

with U (x) deﬁned in Eq. (2.4). One should now solve
Eqs. (7.1) separately at x > 0 and x < 0 and match the
solutions at x = 0.

A. Eigenenergies

First, following Refs.14–16, we write the eigenenergies
E(K) of the Hamiltonian H0(K), Eq. (2.3), for an arbi-
trary relation between t⊥ and the characteristic energies
inside one layer in the form :

E1 (K) = ℏv (−t⊥/2 − E (K)) ,
E2 (K) = ℏv (−t⊥/2 + E (K)) ,
E3 (K) = ℏv (t⊥/2 + E (K)) ,
E4 (K) = ℏv (t⊥/2 − E (K)) ,

region of the normal metal N1 and EF > 0 one should
take the solution of Eq. (7.6) for K as a function of ε at
ε > −EF and of Eq. (7.7) at ε < −EF . In addition, one
has a solution for K of (7.7) at ε > −EF and of (7.6) at
ε < −EF . The latter solutions are either exponentially
growing or decaying as functions of x. Nevertheless, they
should also be taken into account when matching func-
tions at the interface because we have the deep potential
−U0 at x < 0 and the exponential growth can change to
the plain wave behavior there.

Here we calculate the wave functions for the region
x > 0. These can be however also used in the region

x < 0 after shifting the energy EF → EF + U0.We will
later on denote all quantities where this shift has been
done by adding the subscript U0, thus obtaining uR,L
1U0 ,
uR,L
2U0 , etc.

2. Plain wave solutions at ε + EF < 0

In this region of energies we have plain waves corre-
sponding to right and left moving holes from the valence
band and use Eq. (7.7). For the right moving holes we
obtain the normalized wave functions :

In this region of the energies we have left and right
moving electrons of the conduction band and use Eq.

region takes the form :

The opposite signs in Eq. (7.15), as compared to Eq.
(7.13), are due to the fact that we now consider holes from
the valence band instead of electrons from the conduction
band.

5. Relations between the variables α, α

′ and γ

′

, γ

The variables α, α′, γ and γ′ are not independent be-
cause the component q parallel to the interface is every-
where the same. Comparing Eqs. (7.13) and (7.22) we
come to the relation :

The scattering process at x < 0 includes a plane wave
that is incident from the left, uR
1U0, and another one, uL
1U0,
reﬂected from the interface.
In addition, in the region
x < 0 one has a wave that is growing with x (decaying
from the interface) with the symmetry of u<
1 from Eq.
(7.17).

After scattering oﬀ the interface one obtains an out-
going wave for x > 0 with the structure uR
1 , Eq. (7.8),
and a decaying wave with the structure u>
2 , Eq. (7.21).
We describe the scattering process for ε + EF > 0 that
matches these functions at the interface :

where B and C are coeﬃcients have to be found by solv-
ing Eq. (7.26). Actually, Eq.
(7.26) is a system of 4
linear equations and one has to ﬁnd four unknown quan-
tities r22 (ε) , t21 (ε) , B (ε) and C (ε).

Writing Eqs. (7.26) explicitly leads to some quite cum-
bersome expressions. Fortunately, these equations are
simpler in the limit U0 ≫ ε, EF , which is explicitly con-
sidered here. The amplitudes t21 (ε) and r22 (ε) can now
be found rather easily. Using Eq. (3.7) we write

We can hence approximate

while the comparison of Eqs. (7.15) and (7.19) leads to

(7.24)

C. Transmission t21 (ε), t12 (ε) and reﬂection r21 (ε)
amplitudes

Now we calculate the transmission t21 (ε) and reﬂection
r21 (ε) amplitudes that match the wave functions written
on the left and on the right from the interface. Again,
we consider the regions ε + EF > 0 and ε + EF < 0
separately. Then, the transmission amplitude t12 (ε) can
easily be obtained from t21 (ε) through the well know
relation

eiα(U0) ≃ 1 + iL (ε) sin α,

eγ(U0) = 1 + L (ε) sinh γ.

(7.29)
and simplify Eqs.
(7.26) with the help of the rela-
tions (7.27-7.29). We solve these equations and arrive at
the following expression for the transmission coeﬃcients
t21 (ε) and r22 (ε) :

t21 (ε) =

compact form

where δ (ε) is a phase whose explicit value is not necessary
for the calculation of the conductances using Eqs. (2.8-

we obtain for the reﬂection coeﬃcient

Using the same approximation (7.27-7.29) and pro-
ceeding in the same way as for ε+EF one comes with the
help of Eq. (7.24) to the following result for the trans-
mission amplitude

20 We want to mention that the conductance across a
BLG/SC interface was already calculated in Ref. 17. How-
ever, the calculations in that publication were done assum-
ing that the potential U0 is highest energy in the system
and explicit results were written only in some limiting case.
In contrast, we use a more relevant assumption that the
potential U0 is smaller than the interlayer coupling energy
and derive general formulas that allow us to make the com-
parison with the experiment2 in the entire region of the
parameters ε and EF
