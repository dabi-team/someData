1. Introduction

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity (GR) [3] is undoubtedly and un-
debatedly the most promising theory of the last century. Though the spark
of Albert Einstein was proved by his theory of Special Relativity (SR) [4]
in front of the entire world, whose generalisation leads us the former one.
Einstein revealed the mysteries of the universe through complex calculation
of Tensor Analysis and explained the beautiful philosophical concept that
matter creates curvature in the spacetime [5]. Though, before Einstein’s
revolutionary discovery, tensor analysis was considered just as a mathemat-
ical tool, not so useful in physics. Even the concept of gravitational waves
was also given by this theoretical physicist with his mastermind thinking, at
that time of minimum technology. Einstein’s ﬁeld equations (EFE) for the
spacetime is very essential to interpret various astrophysical phenomena like
black holes, compact objects, supernovae and the formation of structure of
the universe. After 100 years of GR, we are now able to detect gravitational

waves by promising astronomical instruments like LIGO, LISA, Virgo etc. In
a short, his creation made a new island of perambulation for the researchers
in the ﬁeld of astrophysics and cosmology.

After all the thermonuclear fuels burnt out, type II supernovae explosion
occurs and the gravitational collapse of massive stars (M > 8M⊙) gives the
birth of neutron stars [6]. The concept of neutron stars got concrete support
with the discovery of neutron particle in 1932 by Chadwick. Later, obser-
vationally detection of pulsars [7] strongly re-establish this concept. Being
mostly dominated by neutron particle, neutron stars are extensively dense
and even can distort the geometry of the spacetime. Their expanse is not
very big, radius lies between (11 − 15) km with mass (1.4 − 2) M⊙ [8]. Dun-
can and Thompson [9] suggest that strong magnetic ﬁeld is a characteristic
of such highly compact stars. An immense magnetic ﬁeld of the order of 1014-
1015 Gauss can exist near the surface of the magnetars, strongly magnetized
neutron stars
[10, 11]. Later, Chakraborty et al. [12] suggest that, in the
core of the neutron star even stronger magnetic ﬁeld upto 1019-1020 Gauss
can potentially occur. Obviously the reason behind this strong magnetic ﬁeld
is still under discussion. Though spontaneous ordering of nucleon [13, 14] or
quark spins [15] in the dense interior of a neutron star can be taken as a
cause behind this debating issue.

The extreme high density and tremendous pressure at the core of the
neutron star make it an object of various physical speculation among the
astrophysicists. Due to this high density and pressure, there is a strong
probability of phase transition of neutrons inside the neutron star to boson,
hyperon and strange quark matter. The prediction of Cameron [16] tells us
that hyperon must be produced inside the neutron star. Due to extreme
high density and weak interaction, some of the nucleon may be converted
into hyperon since this is energetically more favourable. Though interior of
the neutron star may also contain quark matter. The quarks become free of
interaction due to high density and extreme asymptotic momentum transfer
at the core of the neutron star.

An individual nucleon contains quarks to form a colourless matter known
as quark matter. The energy level of the hyperon at the Fermi-surface be-
comes higher than its rest mass, due to the tremendous density, as a result
these particles could deconﬁne into strange quarks. The strange quarks are
the most stable quarks. Though the quark stars consists of up (u), down
(d) and strange (s) quarks but mostly it contain strange (s) quarks. Theo-
retically under certain conditions some of the u and d quarks transformed

2

into s quarks. As we know cold strange matter is the true ground state of
nuclear matter [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], the up (u) and down (d) quarks once
converted into strange matter, the entire quark matter get converted into
strange matter. As a result the neutron star totally converted into strange
quark star [22]. Some recent simulations [23, 24] pointed out the merger pro-
cess of two strange stars. So their gravitational wave signal detection may
enhance the probability of SQM hypothesis.

Since the quarks are not seen as free particles, the quark conﬁnement
mechanism have been dealt in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). A strongly
interacting particle can be deﬁned as a ﬁnite region of space, conﬁned with
ﬁelds [25]. Chodos et al. [25] described the Bag constant (Bg) as a ﬁnite
region with constant energy density. So, the energy momentum tensor of the
star must be eﬀected by this constant, and thus the geometry of the spacetime
also be inﬂuenced by the Bag constant. The MIT bag model states that the
reason of quark conﬁnement is due to the universal pressure Bg, known as the
MIT bag constant, which is actually the diﬀerence between energy densities
of the perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamical vacuum.
For a stable strange quark matter, the proposed value of the Bag constant
should be within the following range (55 − 75) MeV/fm3 [26, 21]. However,
wide range of the Bag constant are permissible according to CERN-SPS and
RHIC [27]. In a recent work Aziz et al. [28] have shown the possibility of
wide range (41.58 − 319.31) MeV/fm3 for Bg which they have recovered from
diﬀerent observational data for several compact stars. The probable compact
strange star candidates are X − ray pulsars, viz. Her X1, millisecond pulsar
SAX J 1808.43658, X ray sources, 4U 1820 − 30 and 4U 1728 − 34 etc.

Lugones and Abra˜nil [29] studied the structure of strange stars in Randall-
Sundrum type II braneworld model and investigated the properties of hadronic
and strange quark stars with the help of two typical EOSs, a nonlinear
relativistic mean ﬁeld model for hadronic matter and the MIT bag model
for quark matter. Abra˜nil and Malheiro [30] studied radial stability of
anisotropic strange quark stars, followed the MIT bag EOS, considering van-
ishing and nonvanishing eﬀect of anisotropic factor at the surface of a strange
star. Abbas et al. [31] studied the existence of strange stars in f (T ) mod-
iﬁed gravity with the help of diagonal tetrad ﬁeld of static spacetime with
charged anisotropic ﬂuid and MIT bag model. Isayev [32] studied the stabil-
ity of magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) using the MIT bag model
with density dependent bag pressure. Paulucci and Horvath [33] presented
an analysis of the fragmentation of SQM into strangelets (small lumps of

3

strange quark matter in which ﬁnite eﬀects become important) [34, 35] in
high temperature astrophysical events, considering quark matter within the
MIT bag model framework in color-ﬂavor-locked (CFL) state [36, 37, 38].
Deb et al. [39] studied ultra dense strange (quark) stars employing MIT bag
model, assuming density proﬁle as provided by Mak and Harko [40]. They
featured an interesting result that anisotropy of highly compact strange stars
increases with radial coordinate and attains its maximum value at the sur-
face. This result seems to be an inherent property of the singularity free
anisotropic strange stars. Rahaman et al. [41] studied anisotropic charged
strange star in GR using MIT bag EOS, where Bg value becomes relatively
higher probably to balance the excess repulsion, caused by electric ﬁeld.

Recently, anisotropic strange star in modiﬁed f (R, T ) gravity has been
investigated by Deb et al. [42] when the matter geometry coupling is simplest
and minimum. They also studied isotropic case [43] in f (R, T ) gravity where
they provided a stable stellar model to study strange stars. In our previous
work [44], we have introduced a new model for highly compact anisotropic
strange star using the metric potentials, given by Krori-Barua [45] under
f (R, T ) gravity. We have calculated and explained an interesting result that
value of the bag constant Bg reduces in f (R, T ) gravity due to the coupling
eﬀect between matter and geometry. Besides, there are so many more liter-
atures [46, 47, 48, 49] available on strange stars based on MIT bag model
EOS.

Depending on the inhomogeneity of matter distribution and its evolution,
which also results anisotropic features, the fabric of spacetime of compact ob-
ject changes. During the investigation of stellar properties we must have to
keep in our mind that, for smaller radial size with higher density, anisotropic
pressure plays an important role. The term anisotropic pressure signiﬁes that
the radial component of pressure (pr) diﬀer from that of tangential compo-
nent of pressure (pt). Actually Ruderman [50] has investigated the stellar
models and argued that the nuclear matter may have anisotropic features
at very high density (> 1015 gm/cc), where the nuclear interaction must be
treated relativistically. After this remarkable concept Bower and Liang [51],
Bayin [52], Maharaj and Maartens [53] emphasised on the importance of
locally anisotropic EOS for relativistic ﬂuid spheres. Actually anisotropy af-
fects the physical properties of a stellar object such as the radial pressure,
total radius, total mass, energy density, surface redshift and the frequency of
oscillation of the fundamental mode.

According to Kippenhahn and Weigert [54], the anisotropy may arises

4

due to presence of a type 3A superﬂuid or existence of solid stellar core.
Sawyer [55] suggested that anisotropy in pressure may generate due to pion
condensation. Another reason for anisotropy may be taken as diﬀerent kind
of phase transitions, according to Sokolov [56]. According to Weber [57]
the immense magnetic ﬁeld of neutron star may also produce anisotropy in
pressure inside a strange star. Also the strong electric ﬁeld produces the eﬀect
of anisotropy, as suggested by Usov [58]. The interior gravitational ﬁelds of
anisotropic ﬂuid spheres can be described properly by exact solutions of the
EFE as shown in following references [59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68,
69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74].

To study the anisotropic strange star, we employ the TK metric poten-
tials which provide a class of singularity free solution. Tolman in 1939 [1]
independently gave analytical solutions of EFE by choosing eight diﬀerent
types of metric potentials. Also Kuchowicz in 1968 [2] independently gave
this singularity-free metric potential to describe the stellar conﬁguration.

Recently, Jasim et al. [75] presented a study on anisotropic strange star
under the framework of Einstein’s General Relativity by using the TK metric
It is worthy to mention that their result provides theoretical

However, though ﬂavour of MIT bag EOS is hidden in the value of Bg, the

aspect one may ﬁnds in literature [26, 21] that for stable SQM with the
proposed range is (55 − 75) MeV/fm3.

Being motivated by the above background, especially from the work of
Jasim et al. [75], here we have tried to introduce TK type metric poten-
tials which provide us a singularity-free stellar model for a wide range of
MIT bag values instead of a speciﬁc one. The scheme of the study is as
follows: In Section 2 we have provided basic mathematical formulation of
Einstein’s spacetime. Section 3 contains solutions to the ﬁeld equations. To
represent the model properly we have found the numerical values of diﬀerent
model parameters, which are provided in Section 4. The physical features of
our model are represented in Section 5 through various subsections, namely,
density and pressure, Equation of State, TOV equation, energy conditions,
Herrera’s Causality and Cracking concept, adiabatic index and Harrison-
Zel′dovich-Novikov static stability criteria. Section 6 contains mass-radius
relation through which we can represent surface redshift of an anisotropic
strange star. Lastly, in Section 7 we have drawn some concluding remarks
on diﬀerent aspects of the present model.

2. Basic Mathematical Formulation of Einstein’s Spacetime

We consider static spherically symmetric spacetime metric through the

line element

ds2 = eν(r)dt2 − eλ(r)dr2 − r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2),

(1)

where λ(r) and ν(r) are metric function with TK type [1, 2], chosen as
λ(r) = ln(1 + ar2 + br4) and ν(r) = Br2 + 2 ln C. Here a, b, B and C
are arbitrary constants which can be evaluated on the basis of several phys-
ical requirements. These potentials are well behaved, satisfy the criteria for
physical acceptance and free from the central singularity.

The energy-momentum tensor for anisotropic matter distribution, com-
patible with the spherically symmetric spacetime with signature (+, -, -, -),
is given by

Tν

µ = (ρ + pr) uµuν + prgν

µ + (pt − pr) ηµην,

(2)

with uiuj = −ηiηj = 1 and uiηj = 0. Here the vector ui is the 4-velocity
and ηi is the spacelike vector which is orthogonal to ui. Here ρ, pr and pt
are the matter density, radial pressure and tangential pressure respectively,
of the ﬂuid which is in orthogonal direction to pr. Using Eqs. (1) and (2) one
can obtain Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, assuming G = c = 1 (i.e. Geometrized
unit), as follows

8πρ = −e−λ
8πpr = e−λ
8πpt = e−λ

where ‘′’ denotes the derivatives of the respective parameters with respect to
the radial parameter r.

The simplest phenomenological MIT bag model EOS [76, 26, 21] gov-
erns the SQM distribution inside the strange star. Considering that quarks
are non-interacting, massless and including all the corrections of energy and
pressure, the quark pressure of SQM can be deﬁned as

pr(r) =

Xf =u,d,s

pf − Bg,

(6)

6

where pf is the individual pressure of all three ﬂavors of quarks and Bg is
also known as vacuum energy density which can be treated as a constant
quantity though recent research support its wide range of values.

The relation between the individual quark pressure pf and energy density
3ρf . Therefore deconﬁned quarks

of individual quark ﬂavor is given by pf = 1
inside the bag have the total energy ρ as follows

ρ =

Xf =u,d,s

ρf + Bg,

using Eqs. (6) and (7) we have the MIT bag EOS as

pr(r) = α [ρ(r) − 4Bg] ,

(7)

(8)

where α is a constant. Jasim et al. [75] considered α = 0.28 for the mas-
sive strange quarks having mass 250 MeV [77], however for massless strange
quarks, it has the value 1
3 which we have considered in the present investiga-
tion for strange star. But we scientiﬁcally have studied it by ﬁnding out the
values of Bg in terms of the mass-radius of diﬀerent strange star candidates
where depending on the values of these quantities it can be seen that Bg will
change in a characteristic way.

Without involving any quantum mechanical particle aspect, this simplest
EOS is very useful to study the equilibrium conﬁguration of a compact star,
in the framework of General Theory of Relativity, made up of only up, down
and strange quarks. As we know the radial pressure must vanish at the
surface so from Eq. (8) we have

ρR = 4Bg,

(9)

where R is the radius of the strange star and ρR is the surface density of the
compact stellar model.

3. Solutions of the Field Equations

Now using Eq. (8) along with the metric functions ν and λ, we can solve

Eqs. (3)-(5) and eventually we have the following solutions

Bbr4+Bar2+2br2+B+a

The anisotropy (∆) of our system reads as

∆ ≡ (pt − pr) = (Br2+ 3

2 )(Bbr4+(Ba−2b)r2+B−a)

8π(br4+ar2+1)2

+ Bg.

The metric potentials can be expressed as

eλ(r) = br4 + ar2 + 1,
eν(r) = eBr2+2 ln(C).

(13)

(14)
(15)

Variation of the metric potentials eν and eλ are shown in Fig. 1 (upper
and lower panel respectively) for various strange stars. From these graphical
representations, it is very clear that eν(r)|r=0 is non zero positive value and
eλ(r)|r=0 = 1 which are the necessary conditions for the solution to be free
from physical as well as geometric singularities. Both the metric potential
are minimum at the centre, then increase nonlinearly and become maximum
at the surface.

4. Bounds on the model parameters

4.1. Interior spacetime

The central density can be obtained from Eq. (10) as follows

ρc = ρ(r = 0) = 3

16π (B + a) + Bg.

(16)

Anisotropic condition states that, at the center (r = 0) anisotropy is zero,

i.e., pr = pt,

pr(r = 0) = pt(r = 0).

(17)

4.2. Exterior spacetime

To ﬁnd out the values of constants, we will match our interior spacetime

with the exterior Schwarzschild metric [78] which is given by

ds2 =

At the boundary, i.e., r = R where R is the radius of the corresponding
∂r are continuous between the interior

star, metric coeﬃcients gtt, grr and ∂gtt
and exterior region which leads to the following conditions

Finally we have obtained all constants in terms of mass (M) and radius
(R) of the strange star. Using observed values of these quantities we have
calculated numerical values of diﬀerent constants and physical parameters
for various candidates of strange stars, shown in Tables 1 and 2.

5. Physical features of the proposed model

5.1. Density and pressure

Using density proﬁle as expressed in Eq. (10) along with the numerical
values of diﬀerent constants, we are now able to plot the variation of ρ(r)

with fractional radial coordinate r/R for the diﬀerent strange star candidates.
From Fig. 2, it is clear that density is ﬁnite at the center of the strange star
and decreases monotonically with the increase of radius of the stellar body.
If we look at the numerical values of central density and surface density
of various candidates of strange stars in Table 1, then table transparently
the density at the

surface of the stars, which is the characteristic of ultra dense strange quark
stars [50, 79, 80].

The radial pressure pr and tangential pressure pt are also expressed graph-
ically using the numerical values of diﬀerent constants. Their ﬁnite values
at the center certify a singularity free model of strange star. From Fig. 2 we
can see that radial pressure vanishes at the boundary of stars but tangential
pressure dose not vanishes sharply at the surface of the star which indicate
the spheroidal nature of the strange stars [81, 82, 74].

We have deﬁned the anisotropy (∆) of our model in Eq. (13). According
to Hossein et al. [83], anisotropy will be directed outward when ∆ > 0 i.e.,
pt > pr, and inward when ∆ < 0 i.e., pt < pr. From Fig. 2 it is clear that
anisotropy vanishes at the center of the star after that it remain negative
upto certain distance. According to Hossain et al. [83], negative anisotropy
allows the construction of massive stellar structure. It is very much promi-
nent from the graphical representation that anisotropy will become positive
after overcoming the negative value. According to Gokhroo and Mehra [84]

10

positive anisotropy helps to construct the more compact object. So our model
acquire a stable conﬁguration in the frame work of anisotropy. Also from the
graphical representation we can see that the anisotropy increases and attain
its maximum value at the surface of the star which is an inherent property
of an ultra dense compact star [39].

sure (lower left) and anisotropic stress (lower right) w.r.t. the fractional radial coordinate
r/R for diﬀerent strange star candidates.

5.2. Equation of State (EOS)

The radial (ωr) and tangential (ωt) EOS parameters for our system can

be expressed as

ωr(r) = pr
ωt(r) = pt

ρ = α−16πBg (br4+ar2+1)2
3α+16πBg (br4+ar2+1)2 ,
ρ = 2 B2r2(br4+ar2+1)−Bar2−2br2+2B−a

3α+16πBg (br4+ar2+1)

(28)

(29)

,

where, α = (Bbr4 + Bar2 + 2br2 + B + a).
From Fig. 3 it is clear that 0 < ωi < 1

3 and decreases towards the sur-
face of the respective stars. The inequality condition 0 < ωi < 1
3 indicate
the non-exotic nature [73] of the underlying ﬂuid distribution. Here we have
considered the simplest barotropic EOS as pi = ωiρ, where ωi are the EOS pa-
rameters along the radial and tangential directions. Here we have considered
spatially homogeneous cosmic ﬂuid. Though space and time dependence of ω
are also possible which are in the following literature survey [85, 86, 87, 88].

fractional radial coordinate r/R for diﬀerent strange star candidates.

5.3. The generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation

To study the stability of a strange star under diﬀerent forces we have to
put our model under generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ (TOV) equa-
tion as proposed by Ponce de Le´on [89], which can be represented as

−

MG(ρ + pr)

(pt − pr) = 0,

(30)

12

where MG = MG(r) is the eﬀective gravitational mass inside a sphere of
radius r. MG(r) can be derived from the modiﬁed Tolman-Whittaker for-
mula [90] as

MG(r) =

r2e

ν−λ

2 ν′.

(31)

Substituting this value in Eq. (30) we get the following form of TOV

equation

− (ρ+pr)ν′

2 − dpr

dr + 2

r (pt − pr) = 0.

(32)

The above equation explains the equilibrium conditions of the consid-
ered ﬂuid sphere under the combined eﬀect of gravitational, hydrostatic and
anisotropic forces:

Here

Fg + Fh + Fa = 0.

Fg = − Br(Bbr4+Bar2+2br2+B+a)

(35)

(36)

The variations of diﬀerent forces Fg, Fh and Fa are shown in Fig. 4. The
proﬁle tells us that the combined eﬀect of hydrostatic force and anisotropic
force is counter balanced by the gravitational force, as a result our considered
ultra dense compact stars are in stable equilibrium situation.

5.4. Energy Conditions

In GR, the energy-momentum tensor T µ

ν is described as mass, momentum
and stress distribution caused by matter as well as any non-gravitational
ﬁelds. However, the EFE is ﬂexible enough about the acceptance of non-
gravitational ﬁelds and states of matter in a spacetime model. Hence, the
energy conditions represent and describe the common properties for various
states of matter and all well-accepted non-gravitational ﬁelds in physics. At
the same time, energy conditions are strong enough to rule out several EFE’s
solutions which are nonphysical in nature. To study the physical properties
of an anisotropic strange star completely, we must have to check whether our
model satisﬁes all the energy conditions or not. The energy conditions, viz.
Null Energy Condition (NEC), Weak Energy Condition (WEC), Strong En-
ergy Condition (SEC) and Dominant Energy Condition (DEC), are satisﬁed

13

Figure 4: Variation of diﬀerent forces w.r.t. the radial coordinate r for diﬀerent strange
star candidates.

14

if and only if the following inequalities hold simultaneously at every point
inside the ﬂuid sphere:

NEC : ρ ≥ 0,
W EC : ρ + pr ≥ 0, ρ + pt ≥ 0,
SEC : ρ + pr + 2pt ≥ 0,
DEC : ρ − |pr| ≥ 0, ρ − |pt| ≥ 0.

(37)
(38)
(39)
(40)

Though, there are several matter distributions, for which SEC is violated
from mathematical prospect. According to Hawking [91], any cosmological
inﬂationary process breaks SEC and for any scalar ﬁeld along with a positive
potential, this condition is not valid.

diﬀerent strange star candidates.

Fig. 5 shows that our considered system with suitable choice of mass and
radius, is consistent with all the energy conditions and conﬁrms the physical
validity of our model.

To study the stability of our stellar model, Herrera’s causality condition
and cracking concept [92, 93] are very much accepted over last three decade.
According to the causality condition, square of the tangential (v2
ts) and radial
(v2
ts ≤ 1.
Another concept tells us that the region for which square of the transverse
speed of sound is smaller than the square of the radial speed of sound, is a
potentially stable [92, 93, 94, 95, 96]. So, Herrera [93] and Andr´easson [96]
demand |v2
ts| ≤ 1 for stable matter distribution. This condition is known
as ‘no cracking’, i.e., potentially stable region.

ts (Eqs. (41)-(42)) w.r.t. the fractional radial co-
ordinate r/R, have been displayed in Fig. 6. Here graphs clearly show that
both v2
ts remain within their speciﬁed range (0, 1) throughout the
stellar body. In Fig. 6, magnitude of the diﬀerence between square of radial
and tangential sound speed, i.e., |v2
rs − v2
ts| in Eq. (43), ﬁrst decreases with
the increasing radii and then bounces back to higher value, though always
remain less than unity. Hence our model maintains the consistency with
Herrera’s cracking concept and re-establish the stable conﬁguration.

5.6. Adiabatic Index

The term adiabatic index Γ, ratio of two speciﬁc heats [97], characterizes
the stiﬀness of the EOS for a given density. We can use it to study the stabil-
ity of relativistic and non relativistic ﬂuid sphere. According to Bondi [98],
for an anisotropic ﬂuid sphere, Γ can be written as radial adiabatic index (Γr)
and tangential adiabatic index (Γt). It is used to study the dynamical stabil-
ity of the stellar system against an inﬁnitesimal radial adiabatic perturbation
[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107]. For a stable Newtonian sphere,

3 and in case of neutral equilibrium, Γ = 4

the adiabatic index Γ > 4
3 according
to Bondi [98]. For isotropic sphere in relativistic case, the above condition
modiﬁes due to the eﬀect of regenerative pressure which leads the sphere to
become more unstable. But for general relativistic anisotropic sphere, more
complications arise because the nature of anisotropy decides the stability of
the stellar system. The adiabatic index should exceed 4
3 inside a dynami-
cally stable, relativistic, anisotropic stellar system as predicted by Chan et
al. [108], Heinzmann [109] and Hillebrandt [97]. For our proposed model the
radial (Γr) and tangential (Γt) adiabatic indices can be deﬁned as

We have shown the graphical representation of radial and tangential adi-
abatic indices in Fig. 7. One can see that the adiabatic indices are greater
than 4
3 through out the stellar system and it represents a stable conﬁguration
against the radial perturbation.

5.7. Harrison-Zel′dovich-Novikov static stability criteria

To examine the stability of stars, Chandrasekhar [110], Harrison et al.
calculate the eigen-frequencies for all the fundamental modes.

[111] etc.

18

Figure 8: Variation of dM

dρc w.r.t. ρc for diﬀerent strange star candidates.

Later, following Harrison et al. [111], Zel′dovich and Novikov [112] simpliﬁed
the calculations. To make it simpler, they have presumed that adiabatic in-
dex for a pulsating star is comparable as for a slowly deformed matter. This
presumption leads to the criteria that mass of the star must be increasing
in nature with central density (i.e., dM
> 0) to achieve stable conﬁguration
dρc
and be unstable if dM
dρc

< 0.

In our proposed model, we can represent mass in terms of central density

as follows

M(ρc) =

R(−3R2b + 16πBg − 16πρc + 3B)
2(−3R2b + 16πBg − 16πρc + 3B − 3

R2 )

.

Diﬀerentiating Eq. (46) w.r.t. ρc we get,

dM
dρc

=

R(16πBg −3R2b−16πρc+3B− 3

R2 )2 > 0.

24π

(46)

(47)

Fig. 8 also shows that dM
dρc

is always positive throughout the stellar model.
So, the Harrison-Zel′dovich-Novikov condition [73, 113] further conﬁrms the
stability of our proposed model.

6. Mass-Radius relation and surface redshift

For a static, spherically symmetric, anisotropic ﬂuid distribution we can
calculate its eﬀective mass from the density proﬁle, as given in Eq. (10) and

19

represent it graphically in Fig. 9. Hence, eﬀective mass is

Mef f =

R

Z
0

4πr2ρ(r)dr.

(48)

From Fig. 9, it is clear that as r → 0, Mef f → 0, so the eﬀective mass is

a monotonic increasing function.

For a static spherically symmetric perfect ﬂuid star, Buchdahl [114] de-
rived an upper limit for maximum allowed mass to radius ratio, i.e., 2M
R < 8
9.
Mak et al. [115] generalised the result for charged sphere. The term M
R is
known as compactness which classiﬁes the stellar objects into diﬀerent cat-
egories as follows [116], (i) normal star: M/R ∼ 10−5, (ii) white dwarf:
M/R ∼ 10−3, (iii) neutron star: 10−1 < M/R < 1/4, (iv) ultra dense com-
pact star: 1/4 < M/R < 1/2 and (v) black hole: M/R = 1/2.

The compactness u(r) for our model is given by

u(r) =

Mef f
r

=

R

1
r Z
0

4πr2ρ(r)dr.

(49)

The graphical representation of compactness (Fig. 9) shows that it mono-
tonically increases with the radius of the star and it’s maximum value > 0.25,
implies that our model corresponds to an ultra dense star.

The surface redshift (Zs) and gravitational redshift (Z) for our model can

be represented by the following relations

Zs =

1

1 − 2u(r)

− 1,

p
−ν(r)

Z = e

2 − 1.

(50)

(51)

In absence of cosmological constant, Barraco and Hamity [117] proved
that Zs ≤ 2 for an isotropic star. Later Bohmer and Harko [118] established
that or an anisotropic star, surface redshift can reach much higher value
Zs ≤ 5, in presence of cosmological constant. Though the restriction was
eventually modiﬁed and maximum acceptable value was calculated as Zs =
5.211 [119]. In our case, we get Zs ≤ 1 for diﬀerent strange star candidates
(Table 2). The variation of the gravitational redshift w.r.t. r/R shown in
Fig. 9, decreases monotonically with increasing radii. Z is positive as well
as ﬁnite throughout the system, which strongly supports the acceptance of
relativistic strange star model.

7. Discussion and Conclusion

In the present article our motive is to explore the relevance of TK metric
potentials in the modeling of strange quark stars. Considering the SQM dis-
tribution, expressed as the simpliﬁed MIT bag model EOS (Eq. (8)) we have
studied the strange star more prominently. We have used Einstein’s space-
time to construct the preliminary mathematical background. From Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations, Eqs. (3)-(5), by using the above mentioned TK metric po-
tentials (Eqs. (14) and (15)) and MIT bag EOS (Eq. (8)), we have found
out the solutions of various physical interest and also shown their variation
graphically w.r.t. the radial distance r.

The metric potentials also specify the geometry of the space time. Their
graphical representations (FIG. 1) tell us that both the metric potentials
satisfy the necessary condition, i.e., eν(r)(r = 0) is non-zero positive and
eλ(r)(r = 0) = 1, so that the solutions should be free from physical and
geometrical singularities. Both eν(r)) and eλ(r) increase monotonically and
non-linearly from centre to the surface for all the stars.

However in the framework of GR, our calculated value for Bg remains in
the range (55 − 75) MeV/fm3, for stable SQM distribution [26, 21, 121], e.g.
for star P SRJ 1614 2230 (1.97 M⊙ and R = 10.3 km) Bg = 68.865 MeV/fm3,
for star P SR J 1903+327 (1.667 M⊙ and R = 9.82 km) Bg = 69.161 MeV/fm3
and for a relatively lower mass (1.29 M⊙) star SMC X − 1 with radius
R = 9.13 km, Bg = 68.84 MeV/fm3. Hence it is fascinating to mention that
our calculated Bg values satisfy not only the theoretical stability criteria
[26, 21, 121] but also exactly match to the observational result of RHIC and
CERN-SPS [27]. Our study may be generalised by considering more realistic
EOS obtained from QCD simulations [122].

All the ﬁgures clearly establish the non-singular, stable nature from both
geometrical, physical aspects. All the calculated values for diﬀerent physical
parameter are provided in Tables (1 and 2). Here, the important results from
this strange star model have been discussed as follows:

1. Density and Pressure: Solving EFE (Eqs. (3)-(5)) we get the den-
sity (ρ), radial pressure (pr) as well as tangential pressure (pt) as shown in
Eqs. (10)-(12) respectively. Central matter density ρc of Eq. (16) and central
radial pressure (prc) can also be calculated by putting r = 0 in Eqs. (10) and
(11). Density proﬁle (ρ) and both the pressures (pr and pt) are free from
central singularity. At the centre of the star ρc, pr and pt are ﬁnite and then
decreases continuously with the increasing radius as shown in Fig. 2. In Ta-

22

ble (2) we have provided the values of density at the centre as well as at the
surface for diﬀerent strange stars. These numerical values give a clear idea
that central density is higher than the surface density which is expected for
an ultra dense star made of strange quark [50, 79, 80]. For example, in case
of P SR J 1614 2230, ρc ∼ 7.1713 × 1014 gm/cm3 which reduces upto 68%
at the surface, where density is 4.912 × 1014 gm/cm3. Radial pressure at the
centre of the star also very high, i.e., (4.07 − 6.75) × 1034 dyne/cm2. Accord-
ing to Fig. 2, our model shows the spheroidal nature [81, 82, 74]. Variation
of anisotropic stress w.r.t. the fractional radial coordinate r/R in Fig. 2 also
establish the stable nature of our proposed model.

2. TOV equation: In our proposed model, generalised TOV Eq. (32)
satisﬁes the stability criteria [89]. Fig. 4 clearly shows that combined eﬀect
of hydrostatic force (Fh) and anisotropic force (Fa) balances the eﬀect of
gravitational force (Fg). For every strange star candidates, we get almost
same nature of force.

3. Energy conditions: Another strong reason behind the acceptability
of our proposed model is that our model satisﬁes all the energy conditions,
viz. NEC, WEC, SEC and DEC as mentioned in Eqs. (37)-(40). Graphical
representations of these conditions, shown in Fig. 5 tell that all the energy
values are maximum at the centre but reduces gradually towards the surface.
4. Stabilty of model: According to Herrera’s [93] cracking concept, v2
rs
and v2
ts should remain between the range 0 and 1. Here, following MIT bag
model [Eq. (8)], v2
3 throughout the stellar body
and v2
ts in Eq. (42), always remain in the above mentioned range, which
is clearly shown in Fig. 6. From graph (Fig. 6), v2
ts becomes maximum
(≈ 0.45) at the centre and monotonically reduces towards the surface but
always remains positive. For a potentially stable conﬁguration, Herrera [93]
and Andr´easson [96] demand ‘no cracking’ condition i.e., |v2
ts| ≤ 1 to be
obeyed and it is very clear from Fig. 6 that condition is also satisﬁed.

rs maintain a constant value 1

rs − v2

Both adiabatic index as deﬁned in Eqs. (44) and (45) have been plotted
in Fig. 7. From their variation it’s clear that both Γr and Γt ≥ 4
3 at the
centre and maintain Bondi’s [98] criteria for static conﬁguration throughout
the total stellar body.

Another stability criteria is that, value of EOS parameter should lie in the
range 0 − 1
3. Here, variation of both ωr and ωt have been featured graphically
in Fig. 3. From ﬁgure it’s clear that both ωr, ωt are positive through out the
star and obtain maximum value (≈ 0.11) at the centre and reduces towards
the surface area. Hence the ﬂuid distribution is non-exotic [73] in nature.

23

Harrison-Zel′dovich-Novikov [111, 112] static stability criteria is also sat-
isﬁed [Eq. (47)] for diﬀerent strange stars in our proposed model. Fig. 8
undeniably shows that variation of dM
is always remain positive within the
dρc
entire stellar body and reduces towards the surface from maximum value at
the centre similar as EOS parameter.

5. Buchdahl Condition: Fig. 9 shows the variation of eﬀective mass
function (Mef f ) w.r.t. the fractional radial coordinate r/R. Variation shows
that at r → 0, Mef f → 0, i.e., mass function is regular at the centre. Accord-
ing to Buchdahl [114] condition, mass radius ratio, i.e., M
3, for static,
spherically symmetric and perfect ﬂuid distribution. In the present study, we
have considered 5 diﬀerent strange star candidates (Table 1) with their ob-
served radius and mass value, for which Buchdahl [114] condition is perfectly
obeyed and the ratio remains in the range (0.14 − 0.19).

R ≤ 4

6. Compactness and surface redshift: In this model, variation of com-
pactness (ur) and gravitational redshift (Zs) have been displayed in Figs. 9.
From ﬁgures it’s clear that both the functions are continuous at r → 0 and
increases for higher r value for diﬀerent strange stars. Calculated values for
the surface redshift become maximum for star P SR J 1614 2230 (Zs = 0.27)
and Zs = 0.18 for relatively low mass and smaller radius star SMC X − 1.
Here the Zs value strongly establish that our discussed candidates must be
strange stars.

From literature survey, it’s obvious that various group of researchers have
studied strange stars in the framework of GR. But, few of them have intro-
duced such a model that can’t satisfy all the stability conditions at a time.
Again few proposed models show the stability throughout the stellar system,
but singularity arises at the centre. Few works do not satisfy all the stability
criteria, energy conditions, Buchdahl limit [114] one at a time. However in
our current study, using the TK metric and the EOS for MIT bag model
under the framework of GR, we get a such a model that can overcome all
the stability issues as well as exhibit the non-singular nature throughout the
stellar body.

It is already mentioned, in a sketchy way, in Introduction that recently
Jasim et al. [75] have studied anisotropic strange star using TK metric [1, 2].
In their study, they have assumed the value of bag constant as a ‘ﬁxed
quantity’, i.e., 60 MeV/fm3 for all the strange star candidates under con-
sideration with massive quark condition. As ‘bag constant’ is an inherent
characteristics of strange stars so it can not be exactly same for diﬀerent
strange stars and hence the study by Jasim et al. [75] seems lacking for phys-

24

ical acceptance. However, from our model we can calculate the bag values
for individual strange star, knowing their observed mass and radius only
under the massless quark condition which fall within the proposed range
(55 − 75) MeV/fm3 [26, 21]. Besides, our study provides more simpliﬁed so-
lutions for ρ, pr and pt, using EFEs and MIT bag EOS. Jasim et al. [75] also
have introduced the cosmological constant Λ which is zero in our case. Now,
as a comparative study, we can observe that by setting only Λ = 0 in [75],
one can not simply retrieve our results which are quite diﬀerent from the
results of Jasim et al. [75]. An overall observation on both the works reveals
that the present investigation provides more general analysis of strange stars.
Hence an overall and ﬁnal comment is that our proposed model is a repre-
sentative of singularity-free, stable and viable one which represents a highly
compact star made of SQM and perfectly ﬁts for strange star candidates to
analyze their diﬀerent physically features.
