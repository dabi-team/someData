Abstract

The vibrational spectra of simple CH+

3 –Rg (Rg=He, Ne, Ar, Kr) complexes have been studied

by vibrational conﬁguration interaction (VCI) theory relying on multidimensional potential energy

surfaces (PES) obtained from explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations, CCSD(T)-F12a.

In agreement with experimental results, the series of rare gas atoms leads to rather unsystematic

results and indicates huge zero point vibrational energy eﬀects for the helium complex. In order

to study these sensitive complexes more consistently, we also introduce conﬁguration averaged

vibrational self-consistent ﬁeld theory (CAVSCF), which is a generalization of standard VSCF

theory to several conﬁgurations. The vibrational spectra of the complexes are compared to that

of the methyl cation, for which corrections due to scalar-relativistic eﬀects, high-level coupled-

cluster terms, i.e. CCSDTQ, and core-valence correlation have explicitly been accounted for. The

occurrence of tunneling splittings for the vibrational ground-state of CH+

3 –He has been investigated

on the basis of semiclassical instanton theory. These calculations and a direct comparison of the

energy proﬁles along the intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRC) with that of the hydronium cation,

H3O+, suggest that tunneling eﬀects for vibrationally excited states should be very small.

INTRODUCTION

The spectroscopic investigation of ionic complexes is a challenging task and is usually

accompanied by ab initio calculations to guide the interpretation of the observed spectra.1–7

However, as these clusters are often very ﬂoppy, they request a proper account of anhar-

monic corrections and correlation eﬀects in order to yield reliable results. Complexes of the

methyl cation with rare gas atoms have extensively been studied by Dopfer and co-workers

and a wealth of information is available for these systems.1–5 These authors used infrared

photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculations at the MP2 level

with a modiﬁed aug-cc-pVTZ basis set to gain an understanding of the structural and

vibrational properties of these complexes. Of course, 2nd order Møller–Plesset perturbation

theory is limited in accuracy and predictions are often of qualitative rather than quantitative

nature. Moreover, the harmonic approximation leaves many questions open and thus an

anharmonic treatment of these systems is highly desirable. Consequently, Dopfer and

co-workers concluded that future eﬀorts to explore the properties of the intermolecular

interaction in CH+

3 –He in a more quantitative way will require a potential energy surface
that takes monomer relaxation into account. This prompted Asvany and collaborators

to perform calculations employing 2nd order vibrational perturbation theory, VPT2,8 to

account for anharmonicity eﬀects in the CH+

3 –He complex. These authors used more
reliable coupled cluster calculations, i.e. CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, to determine a quartic force

ﬁeld of the potential energy surface.6 The same way, all calculations presented here use

high-level explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory to determine a multi-dimensional

potential energy surface without imposing any constraints on the coordinates.

It was found, that the structures of CH+

3 –Rg clusters are strongly dependent on the
size of the rare gas atom. For example, while complexation with helium leads to a very

moderate distortion of the CH+

3 moiety, the interaction with an argon or krypton atom
results in a pronounced pyramidalization of the methyl cation. For a detailed discussion of

that issue see Ref. 5 and references therein. Besides that, the zero point vibrational energy

leads to large corrections in the He cluster, while the eﬀects are less dramatical for Ar or Kr

complexes. A proper quantization of these eﬀects requests high-level electronic structure

calculations in combination with high-dimensional variational calculations for determining

2

vibrational wavefunctions.

A particular aspect concerns tunneling splitting within these complexes.1–5 As the

dominant interaction within these complexes is associated with the 2pz orbital of the planar

(D3h) methyl cation, the rare gas atom can be bound to either side of it. This results in

two equivalent minima, which are mainly connected by a movement of the hydrogen atoms

- rather than a large amplitude motion of the rare gas atom around the CH+

3 moiety. The
formal transition state associated with the minimum energy path is planar and shows C2v

symmetry. Consequently, tunneling splitting may formally occur in all of these complexes.

Based on calculations on a 3-dimensional energy surface of the interaction potential at the

MP2 level (keeping all intramolecular coordinates of the CH+

splittings were found for the bending and stretching modes in the CH+

3 moiety frozen), signiﬁcant
3 –He complex and a
splitting of about 0.008 cm−1 for the vibrational ground state.4 In contrast to that recent

studies by T¨opfer et al. based on double resonance rotational spectroscopy do not conﬁrm

this result.9 Therefore, we will consider this aspect in some detail.

Within the course of this study, we introduce and use conﬁguration-averaged vibrational

self-consistent ﬁeld theory (CAVSCF) to determine optimized one-mode wavefunctions in

order to avoid symmetry-broken solutions in the subsequent vibrational conﬁguration inter-

action calculations (VCI). This concept has been developed many years ago within electronic

structure theory and has been revived within the context of calculating crystal ﬁeld split-

tings for molecular magnets.10–12 However, this theory has not yet been transferred to the

solution of the vibrational Schr¨odinger equation. For that reason, we will outline the basics

of this theory brieﬂy.

II. CONFIGURATION AVERAGED VSCF THEORY

In order to keep the equations as simple as possible, we will neglect the vibrational

angular momentum terms13 and the Watson correction term as occurring in the Eckart–

Watson Hamiltonian.14 In all what follows the multidimensional potential energy surface

shall be represented by an n-mode representation15 expressed in polynomials, i.e.

V (q) = V1D + V2D + V3D + . . .

As the Fock-type matrix F depends on the modal coeﬃcients, the equations must be solved

iteratively until self-consistency is achieved, which is responsible for the name of this proce-

dure.

B. CAVSCF Theory

In order to optimize the modals for degenerate states in molecules belong to non-Abelian

point groups, VSCF theory can be generalized to several conﬁgurations by simple averaging.

Assuming identical weights for all conﬁgurations to be considered in CAVSCF, the energy

expression is given as

ECA =

(cid:88)

(11)

where N is the number of conﬁgurations to be considered. We further introduce a fractional

occupation number γai for modal ai of mode i

γai =

N

(12)

where nai is the number of conﬁgurations, in which the modal ai of mode i is used. The

condition

(cid:88)

ai

γai = 1

(13)

must hold for every mode i. Clearly, the weight factors γ simply depend on the conﬁgurations

to be considered simultaneously. With this, eq. 7 can be generalized to

Comparison of the equations for CAVSCF and VSCF theory reveals, that besides the intro-

duction of fractional occupations γai it is simply an additional loop over the active modals

and the extension of the contracted integrals X to all active modals rather than just one

modal in standard VSCF theory. However, this does not lead to any storage problems. Con-

sequently, CAVSCF theory is a rather simple generalization of VSCF theory, which is just the

special case for one conﬁguration. Using identical weights for the individual conﬁgurations

of degenerate states, CAVSCF can be used for determining state-speciﬁc solutions without

symmetry breaking within the calculation of degenerate states in non-Abelian molecules.

III.

INSTANTON THEORY

To quantify the tunneling splitting of the CH+

3 –He cluster in the vibrational ground state,
we used semiclassical instanton theory.20–23 In instanton theory, the tunneling splitting ∆ is

calculated by the ratio of the partition function of the full quantum system, Q(β), and the

partition function of the non-tunneling system, Q0(β)

lim

(17)

where β = 1

kBT is the inverse temperature and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. To calculate
the partition function of the full system, Q(β), in principle all paths from one minimum

to the other should be considered following Feynman’s idea of path integrals. However, in

instanton theory the most likely tunneling path, the so-called instanton, is optimized and

the steepest-descent integration around it is used. Thus, quantum ﬂuctuations about this

path are considered in harmonic approximation by diagonalization of the Hessian matrix

of the full instanton. Along the tunneling path, full anharmonicity is included, and, thus,

instanton theory can be considered to be correct by an order of magnitude.24

IV. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Explicitly correlated coupled-cluster calculations, CCSD(T)-F12a and CCSD(T)-F12b,25

in combination with an augmented triple-ζ basis, i.e. aug-cc-pVTZ,26 have been used to

determine the structures of all complexes and the bare methyl cation, as well as for the

instanton calculations. Note that we used F12a theory for the calculation of all clusters,

but employed F12b calculations for the monomer for which we also used larger basis sets.

In general F12b theory shows slightly better performance for large basis sets than the F12a

approximation. These levels can roughly be compared with conventional coupled-cluster

calculations relying on an augmented quintuple-ζ basis set.27 At the same level of theory,

harmonic frequencies and normal coordinates as needed for spanning the potential energy
surface have been determined. For all calculations we used the Molpro package of ab

initio programs.28

We used n-mode representations15 of the potential energy surfaces truncated after the

4-mode coupling terms within the vibrational conﬁguration interaction calculations.29,30

Within all these calculations the expansion points of the n-mode representations were chosen

to be the equilibrium structures, i.e. local PESs were generated, which harbor just one of

the two possible minima. A multi-level scheme has been exploited, in which the 1-mode and

2-mode coupling terms were determined at the CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ level, while

the 3-mode and 4-mode coupling terms were obtained from CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVDZ

theory.

In order to exploit symmetry within the PES generation more eﬃciently, the

displacement vectors of the degenerate normal coordinates were rotated by π/4 as described

most recently.31 The resulting grid representation of the potential was transformed into an

analytical representation based on polynomials up to 7th order. For the transformation we

used our recently developed algorithm relying on Kronecker products.16 Initial vibrational

wavefunctions were obtained from vibrational self-consistent ﬁeld theory employing a

mode-speciﬁc basis of 20 distributed Gaussians. For this, the Watson Hamiltonian14

has been used,

in which the µ-tensor was truncated after the 0th order term.13 The

subsequent VCI calculations were based on Hartree products (conﬁgurations) generated

from the VSCF modals (one-mode wavefunctions) of the vibrational ground-state. The

correlation space within the VCI calculations was limited to 6-tuple excitations up to

7

the 7th root and a maximum sum of quantum numbers of 25. A conﬁguration-selective

VCI approach29,30 based on VSCF modals of the vibrational ground-state or modals

obtained from CAVSCF theory have been used to limit the computational eﬀort in

this step. Symmetry breakings due to insuﬃciencies in the potential, ﬁtting to the poly-

nomials or limitations of the conﬁguration space etc. were found to be as small as 0.01 cm−1.

Instantons were calculated at 2.0 K and 1.75 K using a quasi-Newton–Raphson

algorithm.32 Note that for the tunneling splitting, the limit of zero temperature is required,

cf. Eq. 17. Here, the temperature is a parameter rather than a physical quantity. 610 images

were used for the discretization of the instanton path. Instanton paths were considered to

be converged when the maximum component of the gradient (in atomic units, i.e. me = 1)

was below 10−8. The rotational contribution to the partition function of the instanton and

the minimum structure was approximated as classical rigid rotors. For the calculation of the

intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) and the the instanton calculations the DL-Find optimiza-
tion library was used.33 The communication between DL-Find and Molpro28 was realized

using the Chemshell interface.34 For the IRC optimization, the Hessian predictor-corrector

algorithm35,36 has been applied as recently implemented in DL-Find.37 A step size of 0.02

a.u. was used to optimize the IRC on the comparably ﬂat PES. To obtain a smooth gradient,

we tightened the SCF and CCSD(T) convergence to 10−11 Hartree for the calculation of the

IRC, instantons, and Hessians along the instanton pathways.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Geometrical parameters

While the equilibrium structure of a molecule is uniquely deﬁned, there are several pos-

sibilities concerning vibrationally averaged structures. Usually, the deﬁnitions diﬀer with

respect to the operator within the integral of the expectation value. We employed internal

coordinates, i.e. bond lengths etc., which were expanded in terms of normal coordinates, the

latter also being used as variables for the wavefunctions. Temperature eﬀects by Boltzmann

weighting were not included in these calculations. Structural parameters being most impor-

tant for this study here are listed in Table I. According to Table I and as discussed in detail

8

by Dopfer and co-workers3 the interaction of the Ar and Kr atoms with the methyl cation are

much stronger than for the other two systems, which leads to a pronounced pyramidalization

of the CH+

3 moiety in contrast to the helium or neon complexes. However, this eﬀect appears
to be less pronounced by the coupled-cluster calculations presented here in comparison to

the MP2 results of the literature.1–3,5 Our CCSD(T)-F12a results also indicate a weaker

pyramidalization due to neon than to helium, which is not supported by the MP2 results.

However, the eﬀects are rather weak and surely within the error bar of the MP2 calculations.

Nevertheless, this result is counter-intuitive as neon shows a larger polarizability than helium

and thus one would expect a stronger pyramidalization. The calculated interaction energy

of the neon-complex is also computed to be larger than for helium (see below). However,

due to the bigger covalent radius, the C–Ne distance is signiﬁcantly longer than the C–He

distance in the helium complex and thus there appears to be a sensitive equilibrium between

the contributing physical forces. The diﬀerences between the vibrationally averaged C–Rg

distances, R0(C-Rg), and the corresponding values within the equilibrium structures, i.e.

∆Re0(C–Rg), are in nice agreement with the estimates of Dopfer and co-workers (cf. the

comparison in Table I).1,2 Note that these values cannot directly be compared as Dopfer and

co-workers determined the diﬀerence in a pseudo-diatomic system and thus these authors

refer to the center of mass of the CH+

3 moiety, while our values refer to the true atom-atom
distances. As the pyramidalization is largest for the Ar and Kr clusters, the largest dif-

ference between our ∆Re0(C–Rg) values and the related results of Dopfer and co-workers

must arise for these particular systems. Table I clearly supports the known result, that huge

ZPVE eﬀects can be found for the CH+

3 –He complex. The unsystematic behavior of the
C–Rg distances is visualized in Figure 1. As must be expected, the ZPVE eﬀects are less

pronounced in the deuterated CD+

3 –Rg complexes. The corresponding values are listed in

Table II.

B. Energetic considerations

Complexation energies, ECplx, relaxation energies, ERelax, and dissociation energies,

De = ECplx − ERelax, of the CH+

3 –Rg complexes are shown in Table III. Clearly, the
complexation energies and the dissociation energies grow with increasing period of the

rare gas atoms. However, this does not hold true for the relaxation energy of the CH+
3

9

moiety, which is in agreement with the pyramidalization as discussed above, i.e. for the

neon complex the pyramidalization (see ∆Re(C–H3) in Table I) is less pronounced than for

helium and likewise is the relaxation energy. Moreover, as discussed in detail by Dopfer

and co-workers, the ZPVE has a huge eﬀect on the dissociation energy of CH+

3 –He, which
steadily decreases with the period of the rare gas atoms. All energies listed in Table III

are much larger for Ar and Kr than for He and Ne. This is in line with the conclusion of

Dopfer and co-workers that only the CH+

3 –Rg dimers with large rare gas ligands have bonds
with substantial covalent character. This result is also supported by natural population and

bond analyses (NBO),38 which show a covalent C-Rg bond for Rg={Ar,Kr} associated with

a substantial charge transfer. For the small rare gas atoms, i.e. He and Ne, the NBO and

the charge transfer cannot be seen. An analysis based on symmetry adapted perturbation

theory (SAPT)39 reveals, that in the latter two systems, the interaction energy is dominated

by induction and to a lesser extent by dispersion. Again, this agrees with the conclusions of

Dopfer.5 For the deuterated species, the D0 values are 348.8 (He), 785.2 (Ne), 5717.3 (Ar)
and 8781.4 cm−1 (Kr).

As mentioned above, the complexes discussed here allow for an internal rotation of the

CH+

3 moiety, which give rise to formal planar transition states of C2v symmetry. We have
computed these barriers to be 698.5 (He), 916.4 (Ne), 5891.7 (Ar) and 8763.8 cm−1 (Kr).

Dopfer and co-workers reported these values to be about 600, 750, and 6000 cm−1 (He, Ne,

Ar).2 Clearly, the barriers for CH+

3 –Kr are too high to show any impact on the
vibrational structure. It is the covalent bond character, which hinders the internal rotation

3 –Ar and CH+

in the latter two complexes. However, for the helium and neon complexes, the barriers are

just slightly below the dissociation channels (De) and are low enough that tunneling eﬀects

may lead to vibrational splittings as discussed by Dopfer and Luckhaus.4 We will discuss

this aspect in detail below.

10

C. Vibrational frequencies

1. Methyl cation

The experimental determination of the fundamental modes of the bare methyl cation

(D3h) is a non-trivial task and several attempts have been undertaken to assign the

individual modes.40–44 The only accurately determined frequency of the methyl cation is

the degenerate CH stretching mode, which has been determined by Crofton et al.40 using

infrared spectroscopy to be 3108.4 cm−1. The only other mode, which has been determined

experimentally, is the out-of-plane umbrella mode ν2. From photoelectron spectroscopy

this vibration was found at 1406±30, 1366±20 and 1356 cm−1, respectively, while ion pair

imaging spectroscopy yielded a value of 1359±7 cm−1.41–44 A more recent measurement

by Cunha de Miranda et al.45 based on threshold photoelectron spectroscopy determined

this fundamental at 1387±15 cm−1. The scattering of these values and the large error

bars indicate the problems associated with the assignment of this particular band. For

CD+

3 the situation diﬀers completely. Asvany et al.6 determined all fundamentals except
the symmetric CD stretching mode, which are in nice agreement with our theoretical

predictions (see below).

Due to its limited size, the methyl cation has theoretically been studied by many

authors.45–48 Yu and Sears computed the anharmonic vibrational frequencies of the methyl

cation and its deuterated isotopologue using CCSD(T) calculations at the basis set limit.46

These authors applied a coordinate scaling procedure in order to compensate for systematic

overestimations in their calculations, which was criticized in the work of Cunha de Miranda

et al.45 Moreover, Yu and Sears used a rather limited force ﬁeld in contrast to the calcula-

tions of Keceli et al.,47 Cunha de Miranda et al.45 and our own calculations, which include

some 11248 potential terms. The results of Keceli et al.47 do not include corrections due to

the vibrational angular momentum (VAM) terms, which were found to be very important

by Cunha de Miranda et al.,45 who determined corrections by up to 22 cm−1. Therefore, we

consider the most reliable values to be those of Cunha de Miranda et al.,45 which essentially

coincide with our own calculation. However, this must be expected as the setup of our cal-

culations essentially is the same as theirs although we use an n-mode expansion truncated

11

after the 4-mode coupling terms rather than the 3-mode couplings. However, this simply

indicates that the n-mode expansion of the potential energy surface is converged after the

inclusion of the 3-mode coupling terms. Our results are summarized in Table IV.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of core-valence correlation etc. on this small molecule,

which has not yet been done in any of the preceding theoretical studies, we have performed

additional calculations, which account for these contributions. In order to limit the compu-

tational eﬀort within the generation of the potential energy surfaces, we used a multi-level

scheme, i.e. these further corrections were applied to the 1D and 2D-terms of the n-mode

expansion of the potential, while the 3D and 4D-terms were determined at the CCSD(T)-

F12b/cc-pVTZ-f12 level only. Core-valence corrections were determined from conventional

CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ calculation relative to frozen core CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ results. This

correction was found to be largest for the two CH-stretching modes ν1 and ν3 and accounted

for 4.8 and 4.9 cm−1, respectively. For the other two modes the correction was less than 2.0

cm−1. Relativistic eﬀects were determined from scalar-relativistic calculations employing a

2nd order Douglas–Kroll–Hess Hamiltonian.49,50 In these calculations a aug-cc-pwCVQZ-dk

basis set has been used. These corrections were determined to be very small, they amounted

to less than 0.6 cm−1 for all frequencies. In a last step we incorporated high-order coupled-
cluster terms by using the GeCCo suite of ab initio programs.51,52 As these calculations

are very demanding, we used a standard cc-pVTZ basis set for CCSDT calculations and a

cc-pVDZ basis within the CCSDTQ calculations. The calculations led to a lowering of the

frequencies by up to −2.2 cm−1. Besides these corrections to the potential energy surface,

we also included linear terms in the expansion of the µ-tensor rather than the constant term

only within the evaluation of the VAM corrections.13 However, these correction were found

to be very small and accounted to not more than 0.4 cm−1. Adding all these corrections

yields our most reliable values for CH+

3 , which are shown in the 3rd column of Table IV.
Apparently, the inclusion of core-valence correlation provides the largest correction, which

is partly compensated for by the high-level coupled-cluster terms. This eﬀect is well-known

and has been observed by several authors.53–55 The comparison of these results with

our standard calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-f12 level shows that the diﬀer-

ences are fairly small, but relies on the error compensation of the aforementioned corrections.

For the deuterated isotopologue our VCI calculations are in excellent agreement with the

12

experimental results of Asvany et al.6 and the theoretical predictions of Cunha de Miranda

et al.45

2. CH+

3 –Rg complexes

Harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies for all complexes are summarized in

Tables V and VI. Concerning the CH+

3 –He frequencies, our results agree to within 10 cm−1
with the computational results of Asvany and collaborators6 – except for the intermolecular

coupling modes. Note that Asvany et al. used 2nd order vibrational perturbation theory,

VPT2, based on a quartic force ﬁeld obtained from conventional CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ

calculations. This readily explains the diﬀerences between their and our calculations. A

comparison with the experimental data shows that the CH stretching modes are nicely

reproduced by our calculations, while the bending modes of the CH+

3 moiety show larger
deviations. Although the interaction of the helium atom with the methyl cation is rather

weak, its introduction leads to frequency shifts of more than 20 cm−1 (ν2) with respect to

the bare methyl cation.

Of particular interest are the intermolecular bending modes νb of CH+

3 –He.
The most obvious and surprising eﬀect concerning these modes are corrections due to

3 –He and CD+

anharmonicity of up to almost 50%. With increasing size of the rare gas atom, the strong

anharmonicity of the intermolecular bending mode decreases and amounts to less than 3%

in case of the CH+

3 –Kr complex (cf. Table V). The huge correction due to anharmonicity
can already be seen in the VSCF calculations and prompted us to visualize the harmonic

potential in comparison to the eﬀective anharmonic potential within the VSCF calculation of

the vibrational ground state of CH+

3 –He, cf. Figure 2. Clearly, the eﬀective potential shows
a strong quartic contribution and thus the harmonic approximation must be considered a

rather poor approximation for this particular mode.

While all intramolecular modes of the CH+

3 moieties and the intermolecular
stretching modes νs were found to be stable with respect to the correlation space within

3 and CD+

the VCI calculations, the degenerate bending modes are very sensitive concerning the cor-

relation space and thus the nature of the underlying VSCF modals. In principle, the VCI

13

results should be independent of the nature of the one-mode wavefunctions employed in the

conﬁgurations. However, this was not the case for the intermolecular bending mode. The

VCI calculations for νb presented here, suﬀer from the fact, that the inclusion of high-lying

correlation functions did not improve the results, but introduced instabilities arising from

the low lying dissociation channel. Therefore, we had to limit the VCI space with respect to

high excitations for the intermolecular stretching and the bending mode. As a results, the

VCI calculations are not fully converged and do depend on the chosen basis. As must be

expected, this problem vanishes for the clusters with larger values of D0 and has not been ob-

served for the clusters containing Ar and Kr. In order to minimize the observed instabilities

we investigated diﬀerent sets of modals. VCI calculations based on conﬁgurations built from

a simple harmonic oscillator basis (without VSCF optimization) fail completely and yield

results being signiﬁcantly too high. On the other hand, standard state-speciﬁc VSCF modals

lead to symmetry-broken solutions for these non-Abelian systems and are thus not a proper

choice for these particular complexes. Therefore, we used modals obtained from ground-

state VSCF calculations and from conﬁguration averaged VSCF calculations (CAVSCF)

comprising the two conﬁgurations of the degenerate bending modes. For the non-degenerate

modes of course we did not use CAVSCF theory, but standard state-speciﬁc VSCF calcula-

tions. The resulting VCI frequencies for the intermolecular bending and stretching modes

are summarized in Table VII. According to Table VII the stretching modes νs are not

aﬀected by this problem and the ground-state based VCI calculations (gs-VCI) essentially

coincide with the state-speciﬁc VCI calculations (ss-VCI), which rely on CAVSCF modals

for νb and standard state-speciﬁc VSCF modals for νs. Clearly, the instability is largest for
CH+

3 –Ne the eﬀect is in the range
of the accuracy of our calculations and thus we consider this value to be trustworthy, while

3 –He and decreases with increasing values of D0. For CD+

the other three values bear a large error bar. Note that, relying on VPT2 theory Asvany
and co-workers6 determined νb of CH+

3 –He to be 237 cm−1 (cf. Table V), which indicates
even larger anharmonicity corrections. However, it is well known that VPT2 theory yields

excellent results for semi-rigid molecules, which are comparable to VCI results,56 but it re-

mains an open question if 2nd order perturbation theory can handle ﬂoppy systems, whose

potential energy surface cannot be described by simple quartic force ﬁelds and which lead to

strong corrections like those observed for the systems here. All other modes of the CH+

3 –He,
3 –Ne complexes were found to be converged with respect to the correlation

3 –He and CH+

space and thus coupling to the critical bending mode appears to be of minor importance.

D. Tunneling splittings

As mentioned above, all vibrational calculations were based on local PESs, which include

just one of the two 2pz-bound minima. Attempts to generate larger PESs, which include

both minima, failed due to the restriction of our program to rectilinear normal coordinates.

In order to investigate the importance of tunneling, we performed several additional calcu-

lations. In a ﬁrst step, we calculated the minimum energy path along the intrinsic reaction

coordinate between these minima. These calculations were started at the side-bound C2v

transition states, which was found to be 698.5 cm−1 above the minima at the CCSD(T)-

F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ level, but about 127 cm−1 below the dissociation energy (De). Dopfer
and co-workers determined the barrier to be slightly lower at about 600 cm−1.4 The potential

energy along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) is shown in Figure 3. The IRC consists

of two principal movements: (1) Starting in one minimum of the PES, the distance between

the helium and the carbon atoms will substantially be increased before (2) the methyl cation

starts rotating as depicted in Figure 3. Note that the C–He distance, R(C–He) increases
from 1.817 ˚A in the minimum to 3.091 ˚A in the transition state. The onset for the rotation

appears to be rather late and, thus, the barrier for this reaction is fairly broad. For example,

at about s = −4 Bohr amu1/2 the rotational angle θ(HCHe) has changed by less than 10
degrees, but the distance has already increased by more than 0.7 ˚A and the energy has

increased by about 400 cm−1. At the beginning of the path, the barrier is largely controlled

by the C–He distance rather than the movement of the hydrogen atoms.

As the width of the potential has signiﬁcant impact on the tunneling splitting, we studied

this aspect in more detail and compared this IRC with that for the inversion reaction of the

hydronium cation, H3O+, which shows very strong tunneling splittings of up to 373 cm−1
for the fundamental modes.57–59 We believe that it is meaningful to compare these two

systems as the barrier height of both reactions is very similar and both reactions include

three tunneling hydrogen atoms. According to high-level calculations including diﬀerent

kinds of corrections, the barrier height for the H3O+ inversion was determined to be 651
or 657 cm−1, respectively. For details see the work of Rajam¨aki et al.57,58 and Neﬀ et al.59

The comparison is shown in Figure 4. The diﬀerence is striking. The width of the barrier

15

for the hydronium cation is much smaller than for the CH+

3 –He complex. Consequently,
one would expect much smaller tunneling splittings for the rare gas complexes studied here.

Moreover, as the width does not decrease very much for higher energies, one would not

expect signiﬁcant tunneling splittings for vibrationally excited states. This expectation is

in contrast to the large tunneling splittings as predicted by the calculations of Dopfer and

Luckhaus.4 Of course, the presented IRC is no proof that tunneling may not occur, but it

is an indication that it is probably of little importance. This would be in agreement of the

recent observations of T¨opfer et al.9

The tunneling splitting of the vibrational ground state of the CH+

3 –He complex was
determined by instanton calculations. As outlined in the Computational Details, these

calculations were not restricted to the local potential, which has been employed for the VCI

calculations, but used the same electronic structure level, i.e. CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ,

on the ﬂy. The instanton calculations predict the tunneling splitting for the vibrational

ground state to be less than 10−4 cm−1 and, thus, to be at least one to two orders of

magnitude smaller than the value determined by Dopfer and Luckhaus of 8·10−3 cm−1.4 Our

result takes into account the 3-fold degeneracy of the path in the partition function, which

is caused by the three equivalent tunneling paths arising from the C3v point group of the

system. Note that semiclassical instanton theory has an intrinsic error bar, which is diﬃcult

to estimate. However, Richardson60 computed the tunneling splitting of the formic acid

dimer with ring-polymer instanton theory and observed an error being not larger than 20%

in comparison to accurate quantum-dynamical calculations. Moreover, he concluded that it

appears to be important to include all dimensions within tunneling calculations and to use an

accurate PES (as we have done in our calculations) rather than using reduced dimensionality

approaches.61,62 Therefore, we consider a value of 10−4 cm−1 to be an estimation of an upper

bound, which we consider to be more reliable than the value of Dopfer and Luckhaus, which

was obtained from calculations restricted to a frozen CH+

3 moiety and to an MP2 potential

of the three intermolecular coordinates only.

Again, this is no proof that signiﬁcant tunneling splitting may not show up for excited

vibrational states, which we could not compute directly, but it makes it rather unlikely. For

that reason, we did not perform comparable calculations for the complexes with heavier rare

gas atoms, in which tunneling processes are even more unlikely due to the higher mass of

16

the system and the pronounced covalent character of the interaction.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

High-level ab initio methods have been used to study the vibrational spectra of CH+

3 –Rg
(Rg=He, Ne, Ar, Kr) complexes. These calculations largely conﬁrm the experimental

results of Dopfer and co-workers and the conclusions of these authors that the bonding

mechanism is controlled by induction for the two smaller rare gas atoms, while a covalent

bond with a pronounced charge transfer can be seen for the Ar and Kr-complexes.

In

extension to previous studies, high-level predictions have been provided for all fundamental

vibrational transitions of these complexes. These were based on variational VCI calculations

relying on multidimensional potential energy surfaces obtained from explicitly correlated

coupled-cluster theory. Results for the vibrational frequencies of the CH+

3 –Kr complex have

been provided for the ﬁrst time.

The intermolecular bending modes of the CH+

3 –He complex could not be determined
with high accuracy due to numerical instabilities arising from the very low lying dissociation

channel of the complex. The most reliable value was obtained from conﬁguration-averaged

vibrational self-consistent ﬁeld theory, which was introduced to optimize the modal basis

prior to the VCI calculations for degenerate states.

Reference calculations for the bare methyl cation show that corrections due to core-

valence correlation, high-level coupled-cluster terms, scalar-relativistic eﬀects and terms of

higher order within the expansion of the µ-tensor are of minor importance. Consequently,

standard CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations already provide excellent estimates at

much lower computational cost.

The aspect of tunneling splittings has been studied in detail. While tunneling splitting for

vibrationally excited states could not be computed directly for technical reasons, instanton

theory provides a splitting for the vibrational ground-state, which is much smaller than ob-

tained from previous calculations. This and the very broad barrier of the potential indicates

that tunneling eﬀects might be negligible even for vibrationally excited states.
