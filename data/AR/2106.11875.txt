ABSTRACT

A ﬁlament, a dense cool plasma supported by the magnetic ﬁelds in the solar corona, often becomes
unstable and erupts. It is empirically known that the ﬁlament often demonstrates some activations
such as a turbulent motion prior to eruption. In our previous study (Seki et al. 2017), we analysed
the Doppler velocity of an Hα ﬁlament and found that the standard deviation of the line-of-sight-
velocity (LOSV) distribution in a ﬁlament, which indicates the increasing amplitude of the small-scale
motions, increased prior to the onset of the eruption. Here, we present a further analysis on this
ﬁlament eruption, which initiated approximately at 03:40UT on 2016 November 5 in the vicinity of
NOAA AR 12605.
It includes a coronal line observation and the extrapolation of the surrounding
magnetic ﬁelds. We found that both the spatially averaged micro-turbulence inside the ﬁlament and

event, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant changes in the global potential-ﬁeld conﬁguration preceding the
eruption for the past 2 days, which indicates that there is a case in which it is diﬃcult to predict the
eruption only by tracking the extrapolated global magnetic ﬁelds. In terms of space weather prediction,
our result on the turbulent motions in a ﬁlament could be used as the useful precursor of a ﬁlament
eruption.

1. INTRODUCTION

A ﬁlament eruption, a spectacular erupting phenomenon of dense cooler plasma, often initiates on the solar surface.
A ﬁlament is a dense (109–1011 cm−3) and cool (104 K) plasma ﬂoating in the solar corona (density ∼ 108 cm−3, and
temperature ∼ 106 K) supported by magnetic ﬁelds. The plasma is believed to be in equilibrium state due to the
balance between gravitational force and Lorentz force. Several models of the magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁguration supporting
the dense and cool plasma have been proposed (e.g. Tandberg-Hanssen (1995)). The so-called Kippenhahn-Schul¨uter
(KS) model ﬁrst proposed by Kippenhahn & Shul¨uter (1957) suggested that the magnetic-ﬁeld topology has a concave-
upward shape where the dense plasma is condensed. In another model called Kuperus-Raadu (KR) ﬁrst proposed by
Kuperus & Raadu (1974), the magnetic ﬁeld has a helical conﬁguration similar to a ﬂux rope. In the KR model, the
plasma is condensed at the bottom of the ﬂux rope.

Seki et al.

In our previous study (Seki et al.

A ﬁlament eruption is often preceded by various dynamical motions called ﬁlament activations (Smith & Ramsey
1964; Parenti 2014; Tandberg-Hanssen 1995; Sterling et al. 2011a). Slow ascending motion of a ﬁlament, typically
with a velocity of a few km s−1 and a duration time of tens of minutes for active region ﬁlament and hours for quiescent
ﬁlament, has been widely reported in studies prior to the eruption (e.g. Ohyama & Shibata (1997); Sterling & Moore
(2004)). A turbulent motion was also reported prior to a ﬁlament eruption (Tandberg-Hanssen 1995) and, more
generally, a solar ﬂare. Harra et al. (2001) observed that non-thermal velocity inside an active region corona increased
prior to the ﬂare on 1993 October 3 and suggested that this is the indicator of turbulent changes in the active region.
2017), we reported that the standard deviation of line-of-sight (LOS) velocity
distribution of small-scale plasma motions inside a ﬁlament increased as the ﬁlament was reaching the eruption around
03:40 UT on 2016 November 5. By using the Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager (SDDI) (Ichimoto et al. 2017) installed
on the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope (SMART) (UeNo et al. 2004) at the Hida Observatory, we monitored
the Doppler velocity map of the ﬁlament from 29 hours before the onset of the eruption. As a result, we determined
that the standard deviation increased to 3–4 km s−1 6 hours prior to the eruption, whilst it was 2–3 km s−1 from 29
to 21 hours prior to the eruption. The average LOS velocity was approximately constant around 0 km s−1. Thus, we
concluded that this broadening LOS velocity distribution (increase of the standard deviation) could reﬂect information
on the preceding turbulent plasma motion inside a ﬁlament.

In this paper, we present further detailed analysis on this event including the extrapolation of the surrounding
potential ﬁelds and the estimate of the intensity in coronal emission lines. Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006) investigated the
ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability called the torus instability ﬁrst discussed in Bateman (1978) in the
situation of low-beta magnetised plasma. They found that critical conditions to favour the instability were related
to the so-called “decay index”, which is deﬁned as the minus gradient of the unsigned horizontal component of the

surrounding the ﬁlament to see whether the torus instability was favourable to be initiated.

In addition, we performed an observational analysis using the SDO/AIA 94, 211, 171, 193 and 304 bands to investigate
the variation of intensity in the coronal emission lines. The destabilisation of a ﬂux rope containing a ﬁlament by
magnetic reconnections plays a key role in initiation of its eruption (Feynman & Martin 1995; Chen & Shibata 2000).
If small-scale magnetic reconnections take place prior to the eruption, rising intensity in coronal (high-temperature)
emission lines will be observable. Those SDO/AIA bands enable us to estimate high-temperature emissions such as
Fe XIV (a few 106 K) and Fe XVIII (∼ 7 MK) (Del Zanna 2013).

This paper is organised as follows: In Section 2, we describe observations and methods used for our analysis with
a brief overview of this event. In Section 3, we present the results of our decay-index investigation and observational
analysis in multiple wavelengths in SDO/AIA bands. In Section 4, we deliver some interpretations of the turbulent
motions and the trigger and evolution of the eruption and the possibility of the application of our results to space
weather prediction.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND METHODS

2.1. Data

In this study, we used a multiple-wavelengths observation of the Sun by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (Lemen
et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The SDO/AIA captures the full-disk Sun routinely in
10 wavelengths including 94, 211, 171, 193 and 304 ˚A with a time cadence of 12 seconds and a spatial sampling of 0.6
arcsec per pixel.

LOS magnetograms of the Sun taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the SDO (Scherrer
et al.
2012) and a synoptic chart of the photospheric radial magnetic ﬁelds inputted by HMI LOS magnetograms
were also used. The SDO/HMI observes the solar full-disk LOS magnetogram with a time cadence of 45 seconds and a
spatial sampling of 0.5 arcsec per pixel. Synoptic HMI charts are remapped “radial” component of magnetograms onto
the Carrington coordinate grid. Here, “radial” means that the observed HMI LOS magnetograms are assumed to be
the LOS component of purely radial magnetic ﬁelds. Thus, for the computation of this imputed radial magnetic-ﬁeld
component, the HMI LOS magnetograms are divided by the cosine of the angle from the disk centre.

The full-disk images in Hα line centre and its wings captured by the SDDI were used to see the morphology of the
target ﬁlament and to compute its LOS velocity. The SDDI installed on the SMART (Ichimoto et al. 2017) at the
Hida Observatory, Kyoto University, has been conducting routine observations since 2016 May 1. It captures the solar
full-disk images in 73 wavelengths with a step of 0.25 ˚A from Hα line centre - 9.0 ˚A to Hα line centre + 9.0 ˚A i.e., at

36 positions in the blue wing, Hα line centre, and 36 positions in the Hα red wing. Each image is obtained with a time
cadence of 15 seconds and a spatial sampling of 1.23 arcsec per pixel. A part of daily observational data (Hα centre, ±
2.0, ± 1.25, ± 0.5, and +3.5 ˚A) is always available on the website (https://www.hida.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SMART/T1.html)
from 2016 May 1 to the present 1.

2.2. Overview

The observed ﬁlament ﬁrst appeared from the solar east limb on 2016 October 28 as a prominence. Its highest spine
was measured as 33 Mm above the limb. It was located at the latitude of N27 degree and in the vicinity of NOAA AR
12605 (see Figure 1), and was tilted by an angle of approximately 45 degree with respect to the south-north direction.
Its length was approximately 112 Mm measured in Hα centre.

The ﬁlament started to erupt around 03:00 UT to the north on November 5 and totally disappeared in Hα line centre
around 03:40 UT. Two-ribbon brightening was observed in both Hα line centre and the SDO/AIA 304 in the vicinity
of the ﬁlament location after eruption (see Figure 3 and 6). This ﬁlament eruption was associated with a B1.1-class
ﬂare in the GOES soft X-ray, which peaked at 04:30 UT (see Figure 2 in Seki et al. (2017)).

A CME was observed at 04:36 UT on November 5 in the SOHO/LASCO C2 (Brueckner et al. 1995) with a linear
speed of 403 km s−1. A moderate geomagnetic disturbance on November 10–11, which peaked at -59 nT in Dst (Nose
et al.
2015) at 18:00 UT on November 10, was also observed. According to Richardson & Cane Catalogue (Cane
& Richardson 2003), an interplanetary CME shock was ﬁrst detected on 2016 November 9 at 06:04UT, which is
consistent with the estimated arrival time of the CME (2016 November 9 11:44UT) derived from the simple empirical
model provided by Gopalswamy et al.
(2000). After the arrival of the shock, the interplanetary CME plasma and
the magnetic ﬁelds were observed by the Faraday Cup instrument of the Solar Wind Experiment onboard the Wind
spacecraft(Kasper 2002) from 2016 November 10 00:00UT to 2016 November 10 16:00UT on the basis of the occurrence
of abnormally low proton temperature and the reduced ﬂuctuations and organisation in the interplanetary magnetic
ﬁelds (Cane & Richardson 2003). Thus, this geomagnetic disturbance can be attributed to the CME associated with
the ﬁlament eruption.

2.3. Extrapolation of magnetic ﬁelds

To investigate the decay index surrounding the ﬁlament, we computed potential ﬁelds from the radial magnetic-ﬁeld
components of the photosphere. The decay index calculated from potential ﬁelds is commonly used for the stability
analysis (e.g. Filippov (2013); Joshi et al. (2014a,b); Li et al. (2016)). In this study, we set the critical decay index
as one, above which the torus instability is considered to be more favourable, following previous observational studies
(Filippov 2013; Joshi et al. 2014a).

It should be noted that it was necessary to compute potential ﬁelds for the whole Sun unlike other cases of decay-
index analysis in which potential ﬁelds are extrapolated only for a subregion of the Sun (e.g. Filippov (2013)), because
the volume to be considered is too large to ignore the sphericity of the Sun. Moreover, for the objective of tracking
the temporal evolution of the global magnetic ﬁelds with a time cadence of 1 day, a synoptic chart is not suitable
for the boundary condition of potential-ﬁeld-source-surface (PFSS) extrapolation, because it is provided once in ∼
27 days (rotation period of the Sun). Therefore, assuming that the unobservable hemisphere was equivalent to the
HMI synoptic map, we used “patched HMI synoptic charts” (described later) as a boundary condition for the PFSS
extrapolation.

Here, we describe how to construct a boundary image used for extrapolation. There are three steps; ﬁrst, we
inputted the radial component of magnetic ﬁelds from HMI LOS magnetogram, assuming that HMI measures the
line-of-sight component of a purely radial magnetic ﬁeld. Secondly, we extracted a region of a magnetogram between
heliocentric latitudes and longitudes of ± 60 degrees. Thirdly, we patched the region in the form of a heliocentric
spherical coordinate to the HMI synoptic chart for Carrington Rotation 2183.

We used Potential Field Source Surface Solver provided by Yeates, A. R. (Yeates 2017) to extrapolate potential
ﬁelds (van Ballegooijen et al. 2000). This Python-based code solves the basic equations for magnetic ﬁelds by using
a ﬁnite-diﬀerence method with an assumption that the electric currents are negligible in a spherical shell. For more
details, see https://github.com/antyeates1983/pfss. We chose 2.0 solar radius above the photosphere and 7 Mm as the

height of source surface and the grid size of radius (height), respectively. Grid sizes of zenith and azimuth angle were
taken to be 0.5 degree.

2.4. Cloud model

To compute the LOS velocity and the micro-turbulence inside a ﬁlament, we utilised a cloud model ﬁrst proposed
by Beckers (1964). Assuming that (1) the source function is constant along the wavelengths and (2) along the LOS
direction and that (3) the line absorption coeﬃcient is a Gaussian shape, this model enables us to determine four
physical parameters of the plasma cloud, the source function, the Doppler width, the Doppler shift, and the optical
depth (Morimoto & Kurokawa 2003a,b; Morimoto et al. 2010; Cabezas et al. 2017; Sakaue et al. 2018; Seki et al.
2017, 2019). The LOS velocity (vlos) and the micro-turbulence (ξ) at each pixel were calculated from the Doppler shift
(∆λS) and the Doppler width (∆λD), respectively, based on the equations below (Morimoto & Kurokawa 2003a);

where c, λ0, kB, T , and mp are the velocity of light, the wavelength of Hα line centre (6562.808 ˚A), Boltzmann constant,

3. RESULT

3.1. Decay index

Figure 1 demonstrates the decay-index distribution in the vicinity of the ﬁlament on November 3, 4 and 5 at 00:00
UT. Left panels show Hα images superimposed by the photospheric polarity inversion lines (PILs) denoted by red
lines and the cross sections of the right panels depicted as cyan lines. Each right panel exhibits the side view of the
three-dimensional decay index along the cyan line in the left panel. From top to bottom, we can recognise a similar
decay-index distribution with time. Generally, the decay index had larger values in the higher location. In the vicinity
of the ﬁlament, the decay index was always below one. Note that the ﬁlament in Hα laid between the positions 2 and
3 on November 3 and 4, whilst it was located between 1 and 2 on November 5. The emerging ﬂux region (EFR; see
Figure 5) appeared in the vicinity of the position 3. The height of the ﬁlament was assumed to be 30 Mm because its
highest spine was measured to be 33 Mm above the limb as a prominence on 2016 October 28.

3.2. Micro-turbulence

Equation (2). The average was taken for the entire main body of the ﬁlament. (For the methodology to determine the

s−1. Although the mean micro-turbulence had been around 12 km s−1 until 21 hours prior to eruption, it increased
to around 14 km s−1 at 22:00 UT on November 4 (6 hours prior to eruption). It continued increasing to around 25
km s−1 until the total disappearance of the ﬁlament in Hα line.

3.3. Coronal line emission

White rectangles are located between the two ribbons. These locations were in the vicinity of the stable ﬁlament seen
in Hα centre. To improve the signal-to-noise, we temporally averaged the AIA data over 5 minutes. We can observe
rising intensities inside the rectangles 3 and 4 approximately from 18:00 UT, while those in the other regions did not
exhibit such an ascent. Note that the location of EFR in Figure 5 corresponds to the rectangle 2.

Inside any rectangles, the counts did not exhibit the rising feature except the sudden increase around 13:00 UT. This

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Turbulent motion

In our previous work (Seki et al.

2017), we found that the standard deviation of the LOS velocity distribution
in a ﬁlament, which indicates the amplitude of the small-scale motions, increased prior to the onset of the eruption.
As seen in Figure 2, the mean micro-turbulence inside the ﬁlament also demonstrated an increase with time, which
should reﬂect the turbulent motion of the plasma even within a spatial scale of one pixel. It should be noted that
the estimate of LOS velocity assumes only one moving component of plasma blob along line of sight, whereas the
micro-turbulence considers the unresolved plasma motion. To derive a more realistic LOS velocity distribution, we
need further investigation to improve the model, but that is out of the focus of this study.

Here, we suggest two possible origins for the preceding turbulent motions; one is the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor
instability, and the other is small-scale reconnections. The small-scale vertical motions of plasma are often observed
in quiescent prominences with high-resolution observations (Berger et al. 2008, 2011). Hillier et al.
(2011) carried
out three-dimensional MHD simulations to analyse how the magnetic ﬂux rope (KS model) is stable to the magnetic
Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and reconstructed the up-ﬂows of the plasma with constant velocities. The dependences
between initial parameters of the ideal MHD simulations and the evolution of the instability were also discussed in
(2012). In their studies, the maximum velocity of a rising plume reached 5.9 and 2.5 km s−1 under the
Hillier et al.
conditions of plasma β = 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. The terminal velocity of the rising plasma plume is determined by
the balance among the Lorentz force, the gravitational force, and the gas pressure gradient at the top of the plume. At
the beginning of the rising, the plume experiences an acceleration due to the buoyancy dominant force. It continues
until the magnetic ﬁelds are transported by the ﬂow and suﬃciently accumulated at the top of the plume to balance
the gravitational force, the magnetic tension, and the magnetic and gas pressures. As a magnetic ﬂux rope containing a
ﬁlament is reaching eruption, it is expected that the ﬂux rope expands, and the magnetic ﬁelds become weaker. Thus,

it will take more time to realise the force balance at the top of the plume, resulting in the faster terminal velocity of
the plume and the more active small-scale motions in the ﬁlament.

The other possibility is due to the small-scale reconnections below the ﬁlament. In this study, we observed rising
intensities in the coronal line in the vicinity of the ﬁlament (see Figure 3). These increasing proﬁles could denote
the continuous occurrence of small-scale reconnections below the ﬂux rope, which could lead to destabilising it and
result in a disturbance of the small-scale plasma inside the ﬁlament. Chifor et al. (2006) observed an EUV brightening
feature (∼106 K) at the footpoint of a prominence ∼20 min prior to the eruption. In their study, they concluded that
this suggestive brightening denoted the onset of “tether-cutting reconnection”, in which once reconnections below a
ﬂux rope are initiated, it will ascend due to cutting oﬀ the anchoring magnetic ﬁelds, and more reconnections will
be induced (Moore et al. 2001). The observation of the continuous enhancement in Fe XIV could be attributable to
this positive feedback process, and the evolution of this event could be explained by this scenario. Note that during
this period there was no increase in Fe XVIII line (see Figure 4), which indicates that there were no substantial ﬂares
causing high temperatures.

4.2. Trigger and evolution of the eruption

An emerging ﬂux was observed around 9 hours before eruption, and this emerging ﬂux could be the trigger of the
eruption. In fact, several studies showed that the existence of EFR plays a key role in the initiation of a ﬁlament
eruption from the observational and theoretical points of view (Feynman & Martin 1995; Chen & Shibata 2000; Kusano
et al. 2012). Figure 5 shows the location of a bipole in comparison with that of the ﬁlament and the snapshots of EFR
observed by the HMI. One can recognise that from 19:00 UT on November 4 the bipole evolved with time. The two
polarities were separated with time, which is characteristic of an emerging ﬂux. Kusano et al. (2012) found that there
are several types of small magnetic structures which should appear in the vicinity of the PIL in order to favour the
onset of solar eruptions. Especially, one of them is called reversed-shear-type (RS-type), in which small-scale magnetic
ﬁeld (such as emerging ﬂux) is injected to pre-existing large-scale sheared magnetic ﬁeld with a certain rotation angle
with respect to large-scale potential ﬁeld (see Figure 1 and 5 in Kusano et al. (2012)). Figure 6 shows solar sub-images
observed by the AIA 304 and the HMI at 03:41 UT on November 5 superimposed by the blue dotted line indicating

the edge of the two ribbons (left and middle). We can notice that the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the
ﬁlament was sheared in clockwise. Right panel shows the schematic diagram of the top view of the large-scale and
small-scale magnetic structures. This magnetic-ﬁled conﬁguration corresponds to RS-type conﬁguration for negative
shear (clockwise rotation) introduced in Kusano et al. (2012). Thus, we conclude that the ﬁlament eruption could be
triggered by the emerging ﬂux observed at 18:00UT.

Figure 1 shows that the decay index nearby the ﬁlament was smaller than one, meaning that the ﬂux rope was stable
against the torus instability . It should be noted that in Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006), they assumed the shape of ﬂux rope
as a ring. On the other hand, Ishiguro & Kusano (2017) found that the ideal MHD instability can be initiated even in
the torus-stable condition, i.e. decay index is less than one, if the magnetic loop has a double-arc-shape conﬁguration.
They called this critical condition for the eruption under a certain geometry as Double arc instability (DAI). The
DAI-favoured magnetic conﬁguration can be produced in the “tether-cutting reconnection” scenario (Moore et al.
2001). Additionally, this scenario agrees with the result of Kusano et al. (2012). The evolution of this event could be
explained by this scenario (see the previous section), and the magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁguration could be the DAI-favoured

Figure 6. Left and middle: Solar sub-images observed by SDO/AIA 304 and SDO/HMI at 03:41 UT on November 5. The
blue dotted line corresponds to the edge of the ﬂare ribbon. White arrow indicates the emerging ﬂux region. To enhance
visualisation, the magnetogram is shown with a scale of lower and upper limits of ± 200 G. Right: The schematic diagram
of top view of the large-scale and small-scale magnetic structures. Cyan and red arrows indicate the small-scale magnetic
ﬁeld and the possible large-scale overlying ﬁeld, respectively. White and black regions correspond to the positive and negative
polarity regions, respectively. Blue dotted lines and P1–4 are simple expression of those in the middle panel. This magnetic-ﬁled
conﬁguration corresponds to RS-type conﬁguration for negative shear (clockwise rotation) introduced in Kusano et al. (2012)

Quiescent ﬁlament eruptions occasionally drive large CMEs and cause severe geomagnetic disturbances. Thus, in
terms of space weather prediction, it is also of a great importance to predict ﬁlament eruptions. McAllister et al. (1996)
reported a large polar crown ﬁlament eruption on 1994 April 14. Although this event was not associated with any
signiﬁcant ﬂares, we experienced a severe geomagnetic disturbance (Dst ∼ -200 nT) within a few days of the eruption.
Isobe et al.
(2019) investigated the records of aurora display in the middle magnetic latitudes (China and Japan)
during the Maunder minimum in 1653, which indicates the presence of a great geomagnetic disturbance although the
solar activity at that time must have been very quiet. With a simple theoretical discussion, they concluded that this
geomagnetic storm was extremely intense (Dst < −300 nT) and can be driven by a quiescent ﬁlament eruption.

Our result implies that it would have been impossible to predict the ﬁlament eruption only from the photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds and the extrapolated potential ﬁelds for this event because the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds scarcely
changed over the past several days of the eruption. From Figure 1, we cannot recognise any signiﬁcant changes in
the global magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁguration which lead to the onset of the eruption. Moreover, the region to be considered
around the ﬁlament is a global quiet one, and we can hardly expect to obtain precise vector-magnetic-ﬁeld data. That
is why it is diﬃcult to extrapolate more realistic magnetic ﬁelds such as non-linear force free ﬁelds for this event. This
illustrates that there is a case in which it is diﬃcult to predict and monitor when a ﬁlament will erupt only from
the global magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁguration. Thus, we suggests that the internal turbulent motion in a ﬁlament can also
provide useful clues to predict ﬁlament eruptions (Seki et al. 2019).
