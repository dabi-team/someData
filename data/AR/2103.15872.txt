We theoretically investigate the ﬂuorescence intensity correlation (FIC) of Ar clusters and Mo-doped iron oxide
nanoparticles subjected to intense, femtosecond and sub-femtosecond XFEL pulses for high-resolution and elemen-
tal contrast imaging. We present the FIC of Kα and Kα h emission in Ar clusters and discuss the impact of sample
damage on retrieving high-resolution structural information and compare the obtained structural information with those
from the coherent difractive imaging (CDI) approach. We found that, while sub-femtosecond pulses will substantially
beneﬁt the CDI approach, few-femtosecond pulses may be sufﬁcient for achieving high-resolution information with
FIC. Furthermore, we show that the ﬂuorescence intensity correlation computed from the ﬂuorescence of Mo atoms in
Mo-doped iron oxide nanoparticles can be used to image dopant distributions.

INTRODUCTION

Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI)1,2 with x-ray free-
electron laser (XFEL) pulses holds the promise to probe the
structure3,4 and follow the dynamics5–7 of entities with atomic
resolution1. This approach is based on the “probe before de-
stroy" concept and makes use of the very high number of pho-
tons in a single pulse. The idea is that with short-duration
pulses, high-resolution diffraction patterns can be captured
with a single XFEL pulse before the system of interest suf-
fers damage from the intense radiation1. Despite continuous
progress, it has remained a challenge8,9 to achieve nanome-
ter or subnanometer resolution and elemental contrast10 with
CDI. This is because intense x-ray pulses will lead to ex-
tremely rapid structural degradation of the sample and gener-
ate a large number of delocalized electrons, resulting in a sub-
stantial reduction in both scattering efﬁciency9,11 and signal-
to-noise in the measured scattering patterns12–14.

To circumvent the challenges of CDI approach, new XFEL
imaging modalities are being developed for Single Particle
Imaging (SPI). Recently, an approach using single-shot ﬂu-
orescence intensity correlation (FIC) has been proposed to
measure the 3-D distribution of heavy elements using intense
x-ray pulses15. This approach was inspired by the Hanbury
Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect16, which has enabled the deter-
mination of the size of astronomical objects from the intensity
correlation of their emitted light. The discovery of the HBT
effect has pushed the imaging resolution below the Abbe limit
(classical diffraction limit) in the visible range17–23, as well
as in the XUV regime24. Also, recent experiments demon-
strated that FIC can be used to directly determine the struc-
ture of trapped ion pairs25,26. We point out that an alter-
native ﬂuorescence imaging approach has been proposed by

a)Electronic mail: pho@anl.gov

Ma and coworkers to measure the molecular structure from
the interference of the emitted ﬂuorescence from x-ray ex-
cited molecules with identical atoms27,28. Unlike FIC, this
approach is related to measuring the ﬁrst-order ﬁeld correla-
tion functions.

With the ever-improving XFEL technology and the emerg-
ing new operation modes that deliver intense few- and sub-fs
pulses at high repetition rates29, the XFEL will further accom-
modate this photon-hungry ﬂuorescence intensity correlation
measurement24 in both the soft and hard x-ray regimes.
In
the past few years, several research groups have begun exper-
imental and theoretical studies of ﬂuorescence imaging that
employs XFEL pulses. For example, FIC method has been
used to determine both the pulse duration30 and focal area31
of femtosecond XFEL pulses. Recent simulation work by
Trost and coworkers suggests that while it is challenging to
image macroscopic objects due to low signal-to-noise ratios,
FIC may be useful for imaging of single particles32. Our pre-
vious study, which used Ar clusters as a prototypical system,
showed that the intense, few-femtosecond XFEL pulses can
enable a multitude of atomic ﬂuorescence channels, but their
dynamics in an extended system is drastically different from
that in isolated atoms. We found that the x-ray emission time
in extended systems is dictated by not only the x-ray pulse
duration and lifetime of the core-excited states. Rather, ultra-
fast electron dynamics can greatly modify ﬂuorescence char-
acteristics by opening additional ﬂuorescence pathways via
electron-ion recombination in addition to the direct photoion-
ization pathways. The existence of these two pathways gives
rise to higher Kα and Kα h yields and broader temporal emis-
sion proﬁles in clusters.

Building on the results of our previous work, we theoret-
ically explore FICs for high-resolution and elemental con-
trast imaging of isolated nanosized systems with intense x-ray
pulses. We investigate the FIC of Kα and Kα h emission in Ar
clusters as a function of pulse duration and discuss the impact
of sample damage on FIC. We show that FIC is less sensitive

where the coherent scattering is suppressed. In principle, it can be placed independent of the beam since ﬂuorescence emission is isotropic. In
FIC, the structural information is obtained from the correlation of many pairs of spatially separated pixels.

to radiation damage than CDI and can be exploited for re-
trieving high-resolution structural information. Furthermore,
we examined the FICs computed from the ﬂuorescence of Mo
atoms in Mo-doped iron oxide hollow core shell nanoparticles
(NPs). In these particles, the macroscopic properties and cat-
alytic functions are sensitive to the presence of Mo dopants
and the structure of the NPs33. However, the inﬂuence of
the dopant is not yet known as the atomic-scale structures
and, in particular, the dopant distributions in the shell are not
known33,34. Our calculations show that FIC is more sensitive
to the dopant distribution than CDI.

II. MODEL

To model the FIC of an extended system, we treat individ-
ual ﬂuorescent atoms as random light emitters, such that the
intensity of the combined emitted radiation ﬁeld at (cid:126)k can be
expressed as

I((cid:126)k) = I0

(1)
where (cid:126)R f , j is the position and φ j the random phase of the j-th
emitter. Here, φ j is related to the emission time of the random
ﬂuorescence event. I0 = (cid:104)I((cid:126)k, {(cid:126)R f , j})(cid:105) , which is is indepen-
dent of(cid:126)k, is the average intensity obtained by averaging over
many realizations of the random ﬂuorescence events, and β j
is considered as the fractional emitter strength such that

in an intense x-ray pulse, this is not true and β j can depend on
the location of the emitter. This is because the x-ray induced
ionization and the subsequent electron-ion recombination and
massive electron rearrangement can quickly transform the ex-
posed sample volume into a nonuniform spatial charge density
structure (neutral core and highly charged shell)35,36.

In this model, the FIC is the second-order correlation func-
tion of the ﬂuorescence intensity measured at two momentum
transfer vectors, I((cid:126)k1) and I((cid:126)k2), and is related to the Fourier
transform of the distribution of the ﬂuorescence emitters ρ f
by the following relation37,38

For a collection of noninteracting emitters (i.e. in gas phase),
|β j|2 = 1/Nemitter. But, for an extended and condensed system

To determine G2, we used our previously developed Monte
Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) method. This is an ef-
fective method for describing matter interacting with intense
x-ray pulses and it has been used to reproduce XFEL exper-
imental data: ion kinetic energy distribution of Ar clusters36,
ion charge state distribution of Ar atoms39 and the ultrafast
x-ray scattering response of molecular clusters9. The details
of this method are described in our previous work11,36.
In
brief, the interaction of the cluster of atoms with the incident
XFEL pulse is treated quantum mechanically with a Monte
Carlo method by tracking explicitly the time-dependent quan-
tum transition probability between different electronic conﬁg-
urations. The total transition rate, Γ, between different elec-
tronic conﬁgurations I and J is given by

Additionally, a molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm is used to
propagate all particle trajectories (atoms/ions/electrons) for-
ward in time. By tracking the time evolution of electronic
conﬁgurations of atoms and ions (timing of each ﬂuorescence
event) and their positions, MC/MD can study the impact of an
intense x-ray pulse on various ﬂuorescence channels, as well
as the associated FICs, in one calculation. Since our analysis
focuses on the intense pulse effect on the ﬂuorescence dynam-
ics, we assume isotropic x-ray emission40.

In this paper, we further exploit the capability of MC/MD
model to investigate multiple imaging modalities. In addition
to FIC, we also examine the x-ray scattering pattern under the
same pulse conditions. The scattering response is modeled
as a sum of the instantaneous scattering patterns weighted by
the pulse intensity, jX (τ,t) with FWHM duration τ. In our
model, the scattering signals expressed in terms of the total
differential scattering cross section of the target system can be
regarded as the sum of the coherent (elastic) and incoherent
(inelastic) scattering41–44

is the number of delocalized electrons within the focal region
of the x-ray pulse and (cid:126)r j(t) are their positions. Our previ-
ous work shows that the IAM works well for describing the
intense-pulse scattering response of molecular clusters9 and
single molecules, in which the difference between the IAM
and DFT methods, which go beyond IAM and include elec-
tron correlations, is of the order a few percents46.

can also include the effect of the bandwidth of the XFEL
pulse9 on the scattering response by convolving the differen-
tial cross section with the bandwidth proﬁle.

Using the MC/MD method, we examine FIC and CDI of
Ar1415 and Ar149171 clusters in an intense 5-keV pulse with a
ﬂuence of 3.5×1012 photons/µm2, which corresponds to 10
times the ﬂuence for saturating single ionization of Ar. The
choice of pulse ﬂuence and photon energy is motivated by our
previous work with a 2-fs pulse, in which these parameters
can enable high Kα and Kα h yield in a femtosecond tempo-
ral emission window. Motivated by the capability to generate
pulses with different pulse lengths, we examine the pulse du-
ration dependence of FIC and CDI, including sub-fs pulses.
To explore the feasibility of imaging contrast with FIC, we
investigate the scattering and ﬂuorescence response for imag-
ing dopant distribution in γ−Fe2O3 with intense x-ray pulses.
Due to the small probability of ﬂuorescence and Monte-Carlo
nature of the calculation, a large number of replicas is needed
to produce statistically converged ﬂuorescence data. For our
calculations, we used 100 to 10,000 replicas such that the er-
ror in per atom ﬂuorescence yield of the interested ﬂuores-
cence channels is less than 0.1 %. A time step of 2 attoseconds
is found to be sufﬁcient to follow the electron processes and
nuclear dynamics47. For each calculation, we propagate the
system dynamics for tens of femtoseconds as the ﬂuorescense
temporal emission extends beyond the pulse duration.

We note that from a given 2-D ﬂuorescence intensity de-
tection from an excited target in a ﬁxed orientation, as shown

Kα, FIC of Kα h and the total differential scattering cross section of Ar1415, respectively, exposed to an 2-fs, 5-keV and 3.5×1012-photons/µm2
pulse. Panels (d), (e) and (f) in the bottom row are the same as those in the top row, except they are for Ar149171. The ﬂuence corresponds 10
times the single-ionization saturation ﬂuence of Ar. The geometry of the ﬂuorescence and scattering detector is shown in Fig. 1. The FICs are
computed with a ﬁxed(cid:126)k1, which points along the -x axis, and(cid:126)k2 scans across all detector pixels on the y-z plane. In this geometry, the FIC
images reveal the ﬁve-fold symmetry of the icosahedral structure of Ar1415 and Ar149171.

in Fig. 1, a large 3-D FIC data set can be gathered from all
accessible pairs of (cid:126)k1 and (cid:126)k2
15. This means one can gather
the full 3D data set needed for 3D reconstruction by measur-
ing ﬂuorescence from a small number of sample orientations.
To illustrate the impact of intense-ﬁeld XFEL on FIC, we fo-
cus on a subset of FIC data, in which(cid:126)k1 is ﬁxed along the -x
axis and (cid:126)k2 scans across all detector pixels on the y-z plane,
as shown in Fig. 1. The ﬂuorescence detector is placed per-
pendicular to the XFEL propagation, where the probability of
coherent scattering is suppressed.

III. RESULTS

A. Ar Clusters

We begin our discussion by showing the ﬂuorescence in-
tensity and the FIC associated with the Kα and Kα h chan-
nels of Ar1415 and Ar149171 subjected to an intense 2-fs
pulse. Both Ar1415 and Ar149171 are constructed as icosahe-
dral structures47. Kα and Kα h are x-ray emission from ions
with single and double vacancies in K shell respectively. As
expected, Fig. 1 shows that the 2-d ﬂuorescence intensity dis-
tribution, (cid:104)I(k)(cid:105), of Ar1415 reveals featureless speckle pattern.
On average, each excited Ar1415 cluster produces 0.0565 Kα
and 0.0572 Kα h photons per atom per pulse over a 4π solid

angle. In comparison, the Kα and Kα h yields found in an iso-
lated Ar atom exposed to the same pulse are 0.048 and 0.040.
The higher Kα and Kα h yields found in Ar1415 are the result
that recombination pathways, in addition to the direct pho-
toionization pathway, are available in extended systems, as
mentioned earlier. Also, we point out the the similar yields
between Kα and Kα h channels are the results of nonlinear
x-ray/matter interaction47.

Unlike the ﬂuorescence intensity distribution, the computed
FICs contain structural information as shown in Figs. 1 and
2. Despite having the same number of photons, FIC from the
Kα h channel has a higher contrast than that of Kα. This is
because Kα h are emitted over a narrow time window in which
the atomic motion is limited, whereas Kα spans a longer time
emission window, which encompasses a larger atomic motion.
For larger systems, Kα h is more advantageous for structural
determination than Kα channel. For example, Ar149171, Kα h
emission count is 1.5 times larger than that of Kα emission
and FIC of Kα h reveals higher contrast than that of Kα, as
shown in Figs. 2 (d) and (e).

Next, we show the pulse duration dependence of FICs com-
puted from Kα and Kα h of Ar1415. Figs. 3 (a) and (b) show
the azimuthally averaged G2(q f ) for Kα and Kα h emissions,

FIG. 3. Pulse duration dependence of FIC computed from (a) Kα and (b) Kα h channels of Ar1415 exposed to 5-keV, 3.5×1012-photons/µm2
pulse. For reference, the FICs computed from undamaged clusters are included. The bottom rows are the temporal emission proﬁle of (c) Kα
and (d) Kα h channels.

where q f = |(cid:126)k1 −(cid:126)k2|. For both of these emissions, we com-
pute the FICs using 4 pulse durations of 0.25, 2, 4 and 10 fs.
The 0.25-fs calculations were motivated by the recently avail-
able XFEL pulses48,49. For comparison, we include the FICs
calculated without damage (i.e. the nuclei are assumed to be
frozen). The same pulse ﬂuence of 3.5×1012 photons/µm2
and photon energy of 5 keV were used in these calculations.
Fig 3 (a) shows that the degree of deviation of FIC of Kα
from that of the undamaged case increases with pulse dura-
tion. Also, the degree of deviation increases with q, which is
inversely proportional to the resolution in real space. Our re-
sults suggest that a shorter pulse will enable higher resolution
imaging with higher contrast.

The examination of the pulse duration dependence of FIC
from Kα h emission, as shown in Fig 3 (b), reveals the same
trend found in Kα emission. However, the FICs of Kα h
are less sensitive to radiation damage. For example, the q-
dependence FIC of Kα h at 0.25-fs is nearly identical to that
of the undamaged case, whereas the q-dependence FIC of Kα
at 0.25-fs deviates from the undamaged proﬁle starting at q >
0.4 Å already. Their difference is the result that the Kα h tem-
poral emission proﬁle is different from that of Kα. Fig 3 (c)
and (d) show that for our pulses with a pulse duration of 0.25,
2 and 4 fs, the resulting temporal proﬁle of Kα is broader than
that of Kα h. These temporal proﬁles of Kα shows a double-
peak structure due to the presence of two pathways: the pho-
toionization pathway and recombination pathway. The con-
tribution of the photoionization and recombination pathway
peak before and after t = 0, which is the peak of the XFEL
pulses. On the other hand, these temporal proﬁles of Kα h
remain a single-peak structure due to the contribution of the

photoionization and recombination have signiﬁcant temporal
overlap47.

Fig 3 further shows that the ﬂuorescence dynamics in 10-fs
pulse is different from that in shorter pulse durations. In par-
ticular, the temporal proﬁle of Kα is a single-peak distribu-
tion, indicating that the Kα production is predominantly via
the photoionization pathway. The negligible role of the re-
combination pathway is due to substantial structural damage
and expansion occurring before the peak of the pulse, leading
to a reduced probability of electron-ion recombination. Fig. 3
reveals the trend that the contribution of recombination path-
way increasingly diminished in a longer (less intense) pulse.
Also, in a 10-fs pulse, the Kα h yield is about a factor 4 smaller
than the Kα yield. The relatively small Kα h yield is due to it
is more probable for a single-core-hole state to undergo inner-
shell decay (Auger decay or emitting Kα) than photoioniza-
tion to produce a double core-hole state in a 10-fs pulse.

Our analysis shows that there is a trade off between high-
resolution FIC images and the ﬂuorescence intensity obtained
with an intense pulse. As pointed out earlier, a shorter pulse
(0.25- vs 2-fs pulse) produces higher resolution and spectral
contrast FIC images, but it also leads to a lower ﬂuorescence
intensity per pulse, as shown in Table I. For experimental con-
siderations, FIC imaging with few-fs pulses might be experi-
mentally more efﬁcient than with sub-fs pulses since the latter
tend to come with a lower number of photons.

Unlike the FIC, the quality of the scattering pattern beneﬁts
substantially from sub-femtosecond pulses in comparison to
that from femtosecond pulses. Fig. 4 plots the pulse duration
dependence of the azimuthally average differential scattering

cal electron radius square. The scattering pattern from a 2-fs
pulse deviates substantially from that computed by assuming
no electronic and structural damage. In particular, their dif-
ference starts immediately after the forward scattering region
and the location of the ﬁrst minimal shifts to a larger q. This
shift is a result that ultrafast ionization leads to signiﬁcant dis-
tortion in the electron distribution of Ar clusters. In contrast,
using the same 2-fs pulse, the computed Kα and Kα h FICs,
which include the effect of atomic motion over a time window
larger than the XFEL pulse, deviate from the corresponding
FIC of the undamaged cases only at high q. This means that
the degree of atomic motion during a 2-fs pulse is not signiﬁ-
cant, and this further suggests that the expanding delocalized
electron cloud is the main factor that reduces the quality of
the scattering image in a 2-fs pulse. To further improve the
quality of the scattering images of the Ar cluster, one can em-
ploy sub-fs pulses. As shown in Fig. 4, the degree of radiation
damage, i.e. the extent of the expansion of the electron clouds
and the nuclear motion, in 0.25-fs and 0.05-fs pulses is small.
With reduced damage, the scattering efﬁciency per pulse and
scattering cross section will also increase.

Also, our calculations also show that about 80 photons are
scattered from Ar1415 exposed to a 5-keV, 2-fs, 3.5×1012-
photons/µm2 pulse. About 50 of these photons are scattered
in the forward direction and in a small q region (q<0.2 Å). In
comparison, about 80 Kα and 81 Kα h photons are emitted
isotropically from the cluster (not including emission from

6

other ﬂuorescence channels). This suggests that, already in
the small q region, the scattering signals and fringes will be
washed out by the ﬂuorescence photons. From the perspec-
tive of imaging small particles (molecules), ﬂuorescence can
be a dominant noise in the scattering pattern. One can increase
the scattering intensity with a higher ﬂuence pulse, but there
is a trade off between the higher scattering signal and qual-
ity of the scattering pattern. For larger systems, the impact
of ﬂuorescence on scattering images will be less severe and it
will be limited to a large q region as the scattering signal (total
cross section) scales with N4/3
(as discussed in work by Kirz
and coworkers50), whereas the ﬂuorescence signal scales with
Nemitter.

B. Doped Iron Oxide Nanoparticle

Next, we explore CXD and FIC for imaging of elemen-
tal contrast in heterogeneous samples. Our hollow core-shell
structure of γ-Fe2O3 has a polycrystalline structure with an
inner radius and outer radius of 6 and 8.5 nm. We consid-
ered three different dopant distributions, as shown in Fig. 5.
In the ﬁrst structure, the Mo dopants are located on the out-
ermost 0.2 nm (i.e., between the radii of 8.3 and 8.5 nm) of
the nanoparticle. In the second structure, the dopants are ran-
domly distributed in the sample volume. In the third structure,
the Mo atoms are doped in the inner 0.4 nm layer (i.e. between
the radii of 6.0 and 6.4 nm). In all these three nanoparticles,
the relative abundance of Mo atoms (the ratio of the number
of Mo atoms and the sum of Mo and Fe atoms) is 6%.

Each of these NPs has about 65.1-k iron, 92.3-k oxygen and
4.1-k Mo atoms. Together with the electrons, each MC/MD
calculation tracks more than 2.7 million particles. These cal-
culations were performed on the high-performance computer,
Mira, at ALCF. We calculate the scattering pattern and ﬂu-
orescence intensity correlation patterns using a 2-fs, 5-keV
pulse. The pulse ﬂuence is chosen to be 5 times the saturation
ﬂuence of the single ionization of Mo atom. At this ﬂuence
level of 6×1011 photons/µm2 and photon energy, the proba-
bility of photoionization for iron and oxygen atoms are below
saturation. The pulse photon energy is chosen such that it is
far from the resonances of the ground state and excited state
hidden resonances in Fe, Mo, and O, and it induces L-shell
ﬂuorescence emission.

Our calculation shows that there are only small differences
among the scattering patterns of these three structures, indi-
cating that the scattering signals are not very sensitive to the
dopant distribution in Fig. 5. These small differences are a
result of the scattering signals being dominated by Fe and O
atoms, in which their distributions are similar in these hol-
low core NPs. We note that the scattering amplitude can be
considered as the superposition of two out-of-phase scattering
amplitudes from two spherical particles with radii of 8.5 and
6 nm. This superposition gives a beat pattern in Fig. 5 (a).

Unlike the scattering processes, the ﬂuorescence emission
is elemental speciﬁc and electronic transition speciﬁc. Figs. 5
(c) and 6 (b) shows that FICs computed from the Lα channel
of Mo reveal distinct ﬁngerprints for these NPs with differ-

FIG. 5. Top panel: Structures of hollow core-shell γ−Fe2O3 nanoparticles with Mo-dopants distributed randomly in the outer layer (left) and
everywhere (middle) and inner layer (right) in the nanoparticle. The yellow, cyan and red dots are molybdenum, iron and oxygen atoms. The
panels in the second row are the corresponding differential scattering cross sections computed from an intense 2-fs, 5-keV XFEL, 6×1011-
photons/µm2 pulse in units of classical electron radius squared. The ﬂuence is 5 times the single-ionization saturation ﬂuence of Mo atom, but
it is below the saturation ﬂuence of O and Fe. The spot near (-0.4, -0.5) in each pattern is a Bragg peak, which is sensitive to the orientation of
the cluster with respect to the x-ray propagation. The panels in the third row show the FICs, given by G2-1 computed from Lα ﬂuorescence
channel of Mo atom. The same pulse parameter set is used for the FICs. The scattering detector is perpendicular to the ﬂuorescence detector,
and their geometry is shown in Fig. 1.

ent dopant distributions already in the small q region. Here,
the pulse parameter is the same pulse parameter used in the
scattering calculations. In comparison, the averaged number
of Lα photons produced per pulse from each Mo atom are
about 0.0351, 0.0332, and 0.0278 for inner-doped, randomly
doped, and outer-doped structures. These different yields are
the result of the temporal emission proﬁle and the relative con-
tribution of the two Lα pathways (direct photoionization and
recombination pathways) depending on the location of the Mo

atoms within the NP. In general, for the Mo atoms residing
near the surface layers of the NP, the Lα events are mostly via
the direct photoionization pathway and they take place earlier
in the pulse (before t = 0, as shown in Fig. 6(c)). However, for
Mo atoms residing deeper in the NP, they have a higher chance
of undergoing Lα via the recombination pathway in addition
to the photoionization pathway, and they have a broader tem-
poral emission proﬁle.

8

resulting FICs from Kα h in general reveal a higher contrast
than those from Kα due to Kα h having narrower temporal
emission proﬁles. In comparison to the result from the 2-fs
pulse, FIC from an 0.25-fs pulse offers only a slightly higher
degree of contrast, but the total ﬂuorescence intensity count
is lowered by a factor of 2, suggesting that few-fs pulses may
be sufﬁcient for FIC measurements. On the other hand, it is
more advantageous to perform scattering experiments with at-
tosecond pulse than with 2-fs pulse as the short pulse reduces
the sample electronic and structural damage, which leads to a
higher scattering cross section and higher quality of scattering
signals. Due to the isotropic nature of ﬂuorescence emission,
it can become a dominant noise in scattering patterns.

More interestingly, we presented the FIC of heteroge-
neous nanoparticle γ−Fe2O3 structures with three different
Mo dopant distributions in an intense x-ray pulse. We show
that, while the scattering signals are dominated by the Fe and
O atoms and reveal small differences between the three struc-
tures, the FICs from Lα of Mo illuminates the three dopant
distributions. Our work suggests that FIC can be exploited for
imaging the distribution of trace elements. In the future, K-
shell excitation in Mo, which requires 20-keV photons, will
also be considered since XFEL pulses with photon energies
up to 25 keV will be accessible at the EuXFEL.

We point out that the current FIC analysis makes use of a
subset of 2-point correlation functions. For future work, it will
be useful to exploit the full volumetric data from a ﬁxed sam-
ple orientation for structure analysis and determine the num-
ber of sample orientations needed for 3-D structural recon-
struction. Also, it will be interesting to explore higher-order
coherence, G(N)((cid:126)k1,..., (cid:126)kN),17,23 derived from the x-ray ﬂuo-
rescence of a collection of atoms exposed to intense XFEL
pulses.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we investigated FIC and CDI for imaging
high-resolution structure of nanosized, non-periodic particles.
We showed that the parameters of intense XFEL pulse, which
can enable many ﬂuorescence channels, can serve as control
knobs to optimize the ﬂuorescence dynamics for FIC imaging.
Using Ar clusters as prototypical systems, we investigated the
pulse duration dependence of the FIC approach from Kα and
Kα h channels. We show that, in few-fs or sub-fs pulses, the
