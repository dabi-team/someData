ABSTRACT
The Fermi -Large Area Telescope (LAT) detection of the X8.2 GOES class solar ﬂare of 2017 Septem-
ber 10 provides for the ﬁrst time observations of a long duration high-energy gamma-ray ﬂare asso-
ciated with a Ground Level Enhancement (GLE). The >100 MeV emission from this ﬂare lasted for
more than 12 hours covering both the impulsive and extended phase. We present the localization of
the gamma-ray emission and ﬁnd that it is consistent with the active region (AR) from which the
ﬂare occurred over a period lasting more than 6 hours contrary to what was found for the 2012 March
7 ﬂares. The temporal variation of the proton index inferred from the gamma-ray data seems to
suggest two phases in acceleration of the proton population. Based on timing arguments we interpret
the second phase to be tied to the acceleration mechanism powering the GLE, believed to be particle
acceleration at a coronal shock driven by the CME.

INTRODUCTION
High-energy gamma-ray solar ﬂares provide the unique
opportunity to examine pion-decay emission at the Sun.
In order for this emission to occur, >300 MeV pro-
tons must be accelerated and subsequently interact with
the chromosphere. Observations of prolonged pion-decay
emission from ﬂares (Forrest et al. 1985; Kanbach et al.
1993; Chupp & Ryan 2009; Ryan 2000) brought forth the
idea that solar energetic particles (SEP) could be linked
to these long-duration gamma-ray ﬂares (LDGRFs) and
that they could have a common origin, coronal Type II
shocks Ramaty et al. (1987).

Fermi -LAT (Atwood et al. 2009) observations of the
Sun have drastically increased the population of LD-
GRFs including hour-long emission from ﬂares originat-
ing from active regions (AR) located behind the visible
disk of the Sun Ackermann et al. (2014); Ajello et al.
(2014); Ackermann et al. (2017). These observations sug-
gest that the coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shock
is the accelerating agent of the >300 MeV protons re-

sponsible for the >100 MeV emission. In fact, all of the
LDGRFs observed by Fermi -LAT are associated with
fast CMEs. SEPs are also thought to be accelerated via
shocks and thus it is natural to search for a link be-
tween LDGRFs, SEP and CMEs (Winter et al. paper
submitted to ApJ). Extreme and/or gradual SEP events
often associated with ground level enhancements (GLE)
are excellent test cases to investigate the connection with
LDGRFs, but unfortunately the solar cycle 24 has been
very poor in GLEs, with only 2 detected.

In this paper we present the Fermi -LAT observations
of 2017 September 10 solar ﬂare associated with the sec-
ond GLE of the solar cycle. We present time resolved lo-
calization of the >100 MeV emission and spectral evolu-
tion including the inferred proton index during the more
12 hour duration of emission.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
After almost an entire year of a nearly spotless Sun and
no ﬂaring activity, the largest ﬂare (GOES class X9.3) of
the solar cycle erupted from active region 2673 on 2017
September 6. This ﬂare was very bright in gamma-rays
and the emission detected by the Fermi -LAT lasted for
almost 15 hours (see the Astronomers Telegram, ATel,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Omodei et al.

10720). Only 4 days later on September 10 at 15:35
UT a GOES X8.2 class ﬂare (SOL2017-09-10) erupted
from the same active region which had now moved to the
edge of the western solar limb (S08W88). This ﬂare lead
to a gradual SEP event with proton energies measured
by the GOES spacecraft exceeding 700 MeV/n and a
very fast CME erupting over the western limb. The ﬁrst
appearance of the CME by LASCO C2 was at 16:00:07
UT and the initial speed was 3620 km s−1. This ﬂare
was also associated with the second GLE (#72) of this
solar cycle. The GLE 72 onset was observed by several
neutron monitors at 16:15 UT but the strongest increase
in count rate was observed at 16:30 UT at the Dome C
station (Mishev et al. submitted to Solar Physics).

RHESSI has good coverage of SOL2017-09-10 with
high resolution imaging showing a single hard X-ray foot-
point located above the solar limb. The corresponding
footpoint on the second ﬂare ribbon appears to be oc-
culted from Earth view. The visible hard X-ray footpoint
is observed to be above the limb, co-spatial with the op-
tical ﬂare signal seen by SDO/HMI (see Krucker et al.
2015). The absence of STEREO B imaging of the ﬂare
ribbon location makes it impossible to precisely locate it
relative to the limb. However, we ﬁrmly conclude that
no hard X-ray emission is detected on the disk indicat-
ing that no part of the ﬂare ribbons are on disk as seen
from Earth view. The >100 MeV emission detected by
the LAT lasted for 12 hours and for that time period the
Sun was the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky (see
ATel 10721 for further details). The onset time for the
LAT was found to be at 15:56 UT, the peak ﬂux occurred
at 15:59 UT remaining statistically signiﬁcant until 05:11
UT of September 11. During the ﬂare, the LAT detected
130 photons with measured energy greater than 1 GeV
and reconstructed direction less than 1◦ from the center
of the solar disk.

In Fig. 1 we plot the light curves from GOES , and
Fermi -LAT for the full 12 hour detection period, while in
Fig. 2 we plot GOES , RHESSI , Fermi -GBM, and Fermi -
LAT for the impulsive phase only. The bottom panel of
each ﬁgure reports the best proton index in each time in-
terval in which the LAT detected the ﬂare. In section 2.1
we describe how we obtain the protons index from the
gamma-ray emission.

2.1. Spectral analysis
We performed an unbinned likelihood analysis of the
Fermi -LAT data with the gtlike program distributed
with the Fermi ScienceTools1. In order to avoid pos-
sible eﬀects from pile-up in the anti-coincidence detector
of the LAT during the brightest phase of the ﬂare, from
15:54 to 16:28 UT, we selected the Pass 8 Solar ﬂare
Transient class (S15)2 to perform our spectral analysis.
This new transient class was developed to be insensitive
to the high ﬂux of X-rays often present during bright
solar ﬂares. For the remainder of the observation time
(from 17:33 to the end of the detection), we used Pass 8
Source class events. For the entire detection time we used
selected photons from a 10◦ circular region centered on

the Sun and within 100◦ from the local zenith (to reduce
contamination from the Earth limb).

We ﬁt three models to the Fermi -LAT gamma-
ray spectral data. The ﬁrst two, a pure power law
(PL) and a power-law with an exponential cut-oﬀ
(PLEXP) are phenomenological functions that may de-
scribe bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic elec-
trons. The third model uses templates based on a de-
tailed study of the gamma rays produced from the de-
cay of pions originating from accelerated protons with
an isotropic pitch angle distribution in a thick-target
model (updated from Murphy et al. 1987). We rely on
the likelihood ratio test and the associated test statis-
tic TS (Mattox et al. 1996) to estimate the signiﬁcance
of the detection. Here we deﬁne TS as twice the in-
crement of the logarithm of the likelihood obtained by
ﬁtting the data with the source and background model
component simultaneously. The TS of the power-law ﬁt
(TSPL) indicates the signiﬁcance of the source detection
under the assumption of a PL spectral shape and the
∆TS=TSPLEXP-TSPL quantiﬁes how much more a com-
plex spectral hypothesis improves the ﬁt. Note that the
signiﬁcance (σ) can be roughly approximated as

TS.

√

In Table 1 we list the TSPL, ∆TS, Γ the photon index
for the best-ﬁt model (PL when ∆TS < 25 or PLEXP
when ∆TS ≥ 25) and PLEXP cut-oﬀ energy. For several
intervals ∆TS >25, indicating that PLEXP provides a
signiﬁcantly better ﬁt than PL. For these intervals we ﬁt
a series of pion-decay models to the data to determine the
best proton spectral index following the same procedure
described in Ajello et al. (2014). Note that the TS values

changes the position by more than two 68% error radii
whereas the correction at 300 MeV remains within the
68% error radius. When examining the corrected posi-
tions we ﬁnd that they are somewhat overlapping, with
the position of the gamma-ray source above 300 MeV.
This could indicate that the systematic error due to the
ﬁsheye eﬀect is larger than the 68% statistical error, for
this reason we will therefore use the 95% error radius.

In addition, the Fermi-LAT localization capabilities are
limited by some small systematics errors due to the in-
strument and the spacecraft alignment precision , which
consist in a 1.1 scale factor on the localization error, and
an additional 10(cid:48)(cid:48) on the error radius (Nolan et al. 2012).
These factors are added in quadrature to the 95% error
radii shown in Figure 3.

We limit our localization study to the time intervals
with longer exposure (>30 minutes) and smaller average
boresight angles (<55◦). We select the time windows
starting at 15:56UT, 19:03UT and 22:13UT and use an
energy threshold of 300 MeV. For the ﬁrst time win-
dow we compute the position using the S15 event class
immune to pile-up eﬀects and maximize the number of
photons collected.

ray emission for those times3 and the 95% containment

distance between the position of the AR (estimated to
(HelioX,HelioY=957,-135 arc seconds) and the best po-
sition for the gamma-ray source. The last column shows
the ratio between this distance and the 95% containment
radius. We see that the location of the gamma-ray emis-
sion is consistent with the AR for all time windows, which
is diﬀerent than what observed for the 2012 March 7
(Ajello et al. 2014).

3. DISCUSSION
The 2017 September 10 solar ﬂare was an exceptional
ﬂare. It was the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky
for more than 12 hours and it was associated with the
second GLE of this solar cycle (GLE 72). The Sun was
in the ﬁeld of view of the LAT for both the impulsive
and extended phase of the solar ﬂare allowing for very
good coverage of the event. The ﬂux behavior of this
ﬂare is similar to other long duration ﬂares detected by
the LAT, namely there is sharp rising and descending
peak coincident with the X-ray ﬂaring activity followed
by a slow rise and fall in ﬂux over a period of several
hours. However, the temporal variation of the estimated
proton index does not show a continuous softening with
time as was seen for other long duration ﬂares (such the
2012 March 7 ﬂares, Ajello et al. 2014) but instead there
appears to be three phases in the evolution of the proton
index. Between 15:48 - 16:08 UT, in coincidence with
the descending phase of the hard X-ray ﬂare time pro-
ﬁle, the proton index softens with values ranging from
3.2±0.1 to 4.0±0.1. During the twenty minutes that fol-
low, both the proton index and the gamma-ray ﬂux ap-
pear to harden/increase and when the Sun comes back
into the ﬁeld of view of the LAT at 17:33 UT, the proton
index has once again hardened to a value of 3.3±0.1 and
proceeds to soften for the remaining almost 9 hours of

ure 3.

for PLEXP and pion-decay ﬁts cannot be directly com-
pared (Wilks 1938) because they are not nested models.
However the PLEXP approximates the shape of the pion-
decay spectrum; thus we expect the pion-decay models
to provide a similarly acceptable ﬁt.

From both Table 1 and Fig. 1 and 2 it is possible to
note how the proton index softens during the impulsive
phase of the ﬂare (from 15:58-16:08 UT) plateaus from
roughly 16:08 - 16:28 UT to a value of 4.0±0.1 and when
the Sun come back into the ﬁeld of view at 17:33 UT
the proton index value is back to the initial value found
during the impulsive phase and proceeds to soften once
more. This behavior seems to imply there being two
separate phases in the underlying acceleration agent of
the protons.

2.2. Localization of the emission
This ﬂare is bright enough to do a time resolved lo-
calization study. Similarly to the situation of the 2012
March 7 ﬂares, we face the same diﬃculties with the
ﬁsheye correction: the asymmetric observational proﬁle
induces uncertainties that change the apparent position
of the gamma-ray source at each time windows, but in a
diﬀerent direction from one orbit to the next (Ackermann
et al. 2012). We performed a study on the impact of the
ﬁsheye eﬀect on the position of the gamma-ray source as
a function of the minimum energy threshold used. We
ﬁnd that the uncorrected position changes signiﬁcantly
as the energy threshold is increased, which is what we
expect from the ﬁsheye eﬀect: the correction at 60 MeV

gamma-ray ﬂaring activity. This behavior in the proton
index variations seems to suggest two diﬀerent protons
acceleration mechanisms.

Based on the analysis performed by Mishev et al. (pa-
per submitted to Solar Physics) we know that the onset
time of GLE 72 as measured by 27 neutron monitors dis-
tributed over the globe starts at 16:30 UT ±1 minute
(these are proton arrival times at 1 AU so that the ar-
rival time is delayed by roughly 3 minutes with respect
the gamma-ray photons). In their analysis of GLE 72,
Mishev et al. ﬁnd that the ratio of Fe/O of the SEPs is
low (<0.07 in the 50-100 MeV/n range) consistent with
a gradual event and the timing of the GLE 72 is also
consistent with a hypothesis of particle acceleration at a
coronal shock driven by the CME. Unfortunately there is
a gap in the LAT data from 16:28 - 17:33 UT because the
Sun was not in the ﬁeld of view. However, based simply
on the timing of the events, the third phase of the pro-
ton index variation occurs after the GLE onset as well as

after the ﬁrst LASCO C2 appearance of the CME associ-
ated with this ﬂare. During this time the X-ray ﬂare has
ceased and no other ﬂaring activity is visible. If indeed
the protons responsible for the LDGRF emission share
the same acceleration mechanism as the SEP population
measured at 1 AU then this could also explain the detec-
tion of the long duration high-energy emission observed
in this ﬂare.

Another unique aspect of this ﬂare is that the location
of the gamma-ray emission is consistent with the AR
over a time period of more than 6 hours as can be seen
in Fig. 3. This behavior is diﬀerent from what was found
for the 2012 March 7 ﬂares (Ajello et al. 2014) where
the emission position was found to move across the solar
disk with time. This most likely an eﬀect due to the
position of the AR on the western limb of the Sun, and
that the LAT can only detect the gamma-rays originating
from the protons interacting in the chromosphere on the
visible side of the Sun.

Fig. 3.— Localization evolution for three diﬀerent time intervals, overlaid on the SDO AIA 171 image of the Sun at 16:10:09UT. On the
lower right corner: RHESSI contours in the thermal (red) and non-thermal (blue) range are shown on a HMI diﬀerence image (dark is
enhanced emissions). The scale of the insert is such that both the thermal and non-thermal emissions are contained in the LAT 95% error
circle.

The RHESSI observations clearly show that the de-
tected non-thermal HXR emissions from the ﬂare rib-
bons occur above the limb as seen from Earth, without
emission from the solar disk (see insert at bottom right
in Figure 3). As gamma-ray producing ions are typically
stopped at much lower altitudes than hard X-ray pro-

ducing electrons, it is expected that gamma-ray photons
from the ﬂare ribbon traveling towards Earth are heav-
ily attenuated or they may even be completely stopped
before they escape towards Earth. It is therefore ques-
tionable that the initial impulsive peak seen by LAT is
from the ﬂare ribbons. The time delay between the 50

6

Omodei et al.

keV hard X-rays and the LAT peak of about 1 minute
(see Figure 2) can be seen as a further hint that the 100
MeV producing protons could be from a diﬀerent pop-
ulation than the ﬂare-accelerated particles that precip-
itate towards the ﬂare ribbons. However, the currently
available data is inconclusive regarding the nature of the
initial impulsive component.

A more detailed analysis of the gamma-ray ﬂare to-
gether with the GLE and CME properties is necessary
in order to better understand the connection between the
accelerating agents of the two proton populations respon-
sible for the emission detected by the LAT and the SEP
measured at Earth. This is the ﬁrst time that a long du-
ration gamma-ray ﬂare has been detected together with
a GLE and serves as a precious case study for the accel-

eration mechanisms at work.
