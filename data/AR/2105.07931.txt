Abstract:  In  order  to  overcome  the  accommodation  and  convergence  (A-C)  conflict  that 
commonly causes visual fatigue in AR display, we propose a Maxwellian-viewing-super-multi-
view  (MV-SMV)  near-eye  display  system  based  on  a  Pancharatnam-Berry  optical  element 
(PBOE). The PBOE, which is constituted with an array of high-efficiency polarization gratings, 
is implemented to direct different views to different directions simultaneously, constructing the 
3D light field. Meanwhile, each view is like a Maxwellian view display that possesses a small 
viewpoint and a large depth of field (DOF). Hence, the MV-SMV display can display virtual 
images with correct accommodation depth cue within a large DOF. We implement a proof-of-
concept MV-SMV display prototype with 3 × 1 and 3 × 2 viewpoints using a 1D PBOE and a 
2D PBOE, respectively, and achieve a DOF of 4.37 diopters experimentally.

Introduction 

Augmented  reality  (AR)  [1-3],  which  augments  the  virtual  information  on  the  real-world 
environment, is an emerging technology that has potential applications in various fields such 
as  healthcare,  education  and  military.  There  are  many  AR  wearable  devices  in  the  market, 
including Microsoft HoloLens, Magic Leap One and Google glasses. However, in most AR  -
displays, the virtual 3D images are generated by feeding the left and right eyes with two parallax 
images. In such a display, the visual axes of the two eyes are converged at the virtual 3D image 
depth, but the eye accommodation is fixed at the 2D image plane of the micro-display. The 
conflict  between  the  accommodation  depth  cue  and  convergence  depth  cue  is  called 
accommodation  and  convergence  conflict  (A-C)  conflict  [4-9],  and  it  will  cause  visual 
discomfort and fatigue after long-term use.  

To  address  the  A-C  conflict  issue  in  AR  displays,  different  display  methods  have  been 
proposed. The first one  is  multi-focal plane display [10-18],  which  generates 3D images  by 
displaying the discrete 2D cross-section pictures of the 3D volume along the visual axis. The 
second method is vari-focal plane display [19], which dynamically adjusts the focal distance of 
a single-plane display to match the convergence depth of the eyes. The third one is Maxwellian-
viewing (MV) display [20,21], where collimated image light is focused to a point at the pupil 
position by an eyepiece to provide an always-in focus image on the retina. Another promising 
approach is super-multi view (SMV) display [22-25]. In a SMV near-eye display, more than 
one parallax images are observed by a single eye, and therefore the light field of the multiple 
views can evoke correct focus adaption of the eye. However, this method usually suffers from 
a limited depth of field (DOF) [26].  

In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  Maxwellian-viewing-super-multi-view  (MV-SMV)  near-eye 
display system based on a Pancharatnam-Berry optical element (PBOE) [27], to achieve both 
correct  accommodation  depth  cue  and  a  large  DOF.  The  key  component  in  our  system,  the 
PBOE, is composed of several regions of high-efficient gratings, that can deflect different views 
to  different  directions.  The  system  also  employs  a  holographic  optical  element  (HOE)  [28] 
which functions as an optical combiner and an eyepiece. In this MV-SMV display, the light of 
each  view  is  produced  from  collimated  laser  light,  and  hence  each  view  behaves  like  a 
Maxwellian-viewing  display,  providing  always-in-focus  images  and  a  small  eye  box  (or 
viewpoint). With multiple views, the light field of 3D objects can be faithfully reconstructed, 
while the DOF of the display is significantly improved due to the small eye box of each view. 
We have implemented the MV-SMV display system and achieved 3 × 1, and 3 × 2 viewpoints, 
respectively.  Experimental  result  confirms  that  correct  accommodation  depth  cue  could  be 
obtained within a large range from 20 cm to 160 cm. 

2.  Theory of depth of field 

The working principle of a Maxwellian-viewing display is shown in Fig. 1 (a), where collimated 
image light is focused to a point by an eyepiece at the pupil position. It is as if each virtual 
image  point  only  gives  out  one  narrow  beam  in  a  certain  direction,  so  in  this  pin-hole-like 
imaging system [29], no matter how the eye adjusts its focus, a clear image could always be 
formed on the retina, resulting in a large DOF. However, in a MV display, the eyebox is very 
small and the image could be easily missed out by the pupil.  

Fig. 1. Working principles of (a) a Maxwellian-viewing display and (b) a SMV display. 

The working principle of a SMV display is shown in Fig. 1(b). Here, s’ is the virtual image 
of the screen (micro-display) s formed by the display optics. So, if we ignore all the viewing 
optics for simplification, it could be considered as if the light beams of the parallax images are 
emitted by the pixels in the s’ plane in different directions. As multiple beams (from different 
views, respectively) enter the eye, the viewer is tempted to believe that 3D point is located at 
the intersection of the beams. To see the virtual 3D point clearly, the eye focus is so adjusted 
that  the  multiple  beams  are  converged  into  one  at  the  retina.  So  in  this  situation,  the  eye 
accommodation is consistent with the virtual 3D point instead of the 2D screen s’. 

In most cases, the beams are divergent with finite beam sizes, so they will form an image 
spot instead of an image point on the retina. The more the 3D point deviates from s’, the larger 
the size it is, and a more blurred image is formed on the retina. Since human eye has limited 
resolution, if the spot is smaller than the maximum acceptable size  , which is about 15  m 
[23], it could still be treated as a point of a clear image. So in order to generate clear images, 
we need to find out the range of the virtual point that could always produce a spot size smaller 
than  Such a range is the DOF of a SMV. If the virtual point is out of this range, no matter 
how the eye adjusts its focus, the virtual image is always blurry. 

 
Fig. 2. Schematic diagrams of the focusing effect when the virtual image is (a) in front of and (b) behind 
the s’ plane. 

In  the  following,  we  will  calculate  the  DOF  of  a  general  SMV  display.  Fig.  2(a)  and  (b) 
demonstrates  the  image  formation  of  a  virtual  point  in  front  of  and  behind  the  screen  s’, 
respectively.  In  either  case,  according  to  the  sets  of  conjugate  planes,  one  could  obtain  the 
following relations:  

(1) 

(2) 

where fi is the focal length of the eye when it is focused at the 3D image, 𝑢𝑖 is the distance from 
the 3D image to the human eye, 𝑣 is the distance from the human eye to the retina which could 
be  considered  as  a  constant, 𝑑0 is  the  width  of  the  light  beam  at  the  pupil  position, 𝑢 is  the 
distance from the screen image s’ to the human eye, and 𝑣𝑖 is the distance from the human eye 
to the s’’ plane (the conjugate image of s’). Here, when virtual image is in front of the plane s’ 
as shown in Fig. 2(a), i=1. If it is behind s’ as shown in Fig. 2(b), i=2. 

In addition, from the similar triangles in Fig. 2(a) and (b), one could obtain the following 

relations, respectively: 

(3) 

(4) 

Where di (i=1,2) is the spot size of the image on the retina. When d1=d2=, we can calculate the 
DOF in the form of diopters: 

(5) 

From Eq. (5), one can see that DOF is inversely proportional to the width of the light beams 

at the pupil d0. Therefore, a narrow beam width is favorable for a large DOF. 

3.  MV-SMV system 

In  the  proposed  MV-SMV  system,  for  each  view,  the  parallax  image  is  produced  from  the 
collimated light source, so that it could be  considered as a  Maxwellian-viewing display. As 
multiple views projected from different directions are perceived by a single eye, SMV condition 
is satisfied and correct accommodation response could be evoked. Because of the narrow beam

width in the MV-SMV display, the DOF is significantly enlarged. In the following,  we will 
illustrate  the  working  principle  of  the  proposed  MV-SMV  display,  introduce  the  two  key 
components,  the  PBOE  and  the  HOE,  and  demonstrate  the  experimental  result  as  we  have 
implemented a proof-of-concept prototype. 

3.1 System configuration and working principle 

The system configuration of the proposed MV-SMV display is shown in Fig. 3. Light coming 
from  a  532  nm  laser  is  expanded  by  a  beam  expander  to  illuminate  a  reflective  amplitude-
modulated liquid-crystal-on Silicon spatial light modulator (SLM). The image loaded on the 
SLM is an array of N 
 M parallax-view sub-images. Accordingly, the PBOE is also divided 
into N 
 M regions, which are basically high-efficient PB gratings with different periods and 
orientations. With precise alignment, the collimated light of a sub-image can only pass through 
the  corresponding  PB  grating,  and  is  deflected  to  a  specific  direction.  The  HOE  (a  Bragg 
volume optical element) and the refractive lens work together to converge different sub-image 
light into different viewpoints at the pupil position. When the intervals of the viewpoints are 
made sufficiently small, one eye could see more than one parallax sub-image, so that the 3D 
images  can  be  reconstructed  by  the  light  field  of  multiple  views,  evoking  correct 
accommodation response. 

The two linear polarizers are appropriately arranged to achieve a high contrast for the SLM 
image. The right-handed circular polarizer (RCP) and a left-handed circular polarizer (LCP) 
are placed in front of and behind the PBOE, respectively, to ensure high diffraction efficiency 
[30]. 

Fig. 3. Configuration of the MV-SMV system. 

3.2 PBOE 

PBOEs  are  thin  diffractive  devices  with  high  polarization  selectivity.  They  are  essentially 
patterned half-wave plates with spatially varying optic-axis orientation. The working principle 
of  PBOEs  can  be  explained  by  Jones  Matrix.  The  Jones  vector  of  the  incident  circular 
polarization could be expressed as: 

where  J+ and J- are for the left-handed circularly light and right-handed circularly polarized 
light, respectively. After passing through a small region of the PBOE where the optic axis of 
the half-wave plate is uniform, the Jones vector of the output light can be described as: 

, 

(6) 

112Jj= 
 
(7) 

where , W() and R() are the azimuth angle of the optic axis, phase retardation of the half 
wave plate and rotation matrix, respectively [27,30]. As one can see here, the handedness of 
the circular polarization is inversed in addition to a phase change of 2. As the azimuthal angle 
 changes continuously from 0 to 𝜋, the phase can be modulated from 0 to 2𝜋 continuously. 
This could avoid the discontinuous phase change and lead to high diffraction efficiency. If one 
could freely control the optic axis distribution of the PBOE, arbitrary phase profile could be 
generated.  

Nowadays,  with  the  advance  of  photoalignment  technique,  in-plane  liquid  crystal  (LC) 
director distribution could be conveniently controlled, and various PB LC devices including 
gratings and lenses have been fabricated at low cost [31]. Fig. 4 (a) shows the LC directors in 
a continuous PB grating, which changes continuously and linearly from 0o to 180o in a period. 
And its phase distribution is shown in Fig. 4 (b). In our experiment, we fabricated 2 PBOEs 
(one has 3 × 1 regions and the other 3 × 2 regions) using a LC polymer material to achieve 3 × 
1 and 3 × 2 viewpoints for the MV-SMV display, respectively. Each region of the PBOEs is a 
continuous PB grating whose period and orientation are appropriately designed to deflect light 
to a unique direction.  

Fig. 4. (a) LC director distribution and (b) phase change of a continuous PB grating. 

To fabricate the PBOE devices, first, the glass substrates were cleaned and then cured by 
a UV-Ozone for 15 mins. Then the photoalignment material, 0.4wt% Brilliant Yellow (BY) 
dissolved in dimethylformamide, was spin-coated onto the substrates at the speed of 500 rpm 
for 5 s and then 3000 rpm for 30 s [31]. Next, the sample was exposed to patterned polarization 
light field produced from a 488 nm laser with the density of 2 mW/cm2 for 40 mins. Here, a 
non-interferometric  setup  [33]  shown  in  Fig.  5  was  employed  to  generate  the  patterned 
polarization field. It could generate an arbitrary alignment pattern by a single exposure. The 
SLM used in our experiment is a phase-type SLM (Holoeye, PLUTO-VIS) with a resolution of 
1920  × 1080 and pixel size  8  m.  After exposure, a  diluted liquid crystal reactive  mesogen 
mixture  (RMM)  solution,  consisting  of  97wt%  reactive  mesogen  RM257  and  3wt%  photo 
initiator Irgacure 651 dissolved in toluene with a weight ratio of 1:3, was spin coated on the 
sample at the speed of 500 rpm for 5 s and then 3000 rpm for 30 s [32]. The same spin coating 
process was repeated once again to achieve the approximate thickness of a LC half wave plate. 
Immediately after that, the RMM was cured by 365 nm UV light to form a polymer film.

Fig. 6 (a) shows the microscopic pictures of the different regions of the 1D PBOE (3 × 1 
regions).  The  middle  region  has  uniform  alignment,  so  that  light  can  directly  pass  through 
without any deflection. The right and left regions have the same gratings period (48 m) in the 
x  direction,  but  complementary  phase  profiles.  The  expected  diffraction  angles  of  the  two 
regions are 0.64° and −0.64°, respectively, according to the grating equation 𝑑sin𝜃 = 𝜆 (𝜆 =
532 𝑛𝑚). The diffraction patterns of the two regions with circularly polarized incidence are 
shown in Fig. 6 (c). The diffraction efficiencies of the right and left regions are 93.2% and 
88.8%,  respectively.  Here,  the  diffraction  efficiency  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  1st  order 
diffracted intensity to the total light intensity collected after the PB grating.

Fig. 6 (b) shows the microscopic pictures of the different regions in the 2D PBOE. The LC 
alignment of the first row is exactly the same as the 1D PBOE. The  orientations of the three 
gratings in the second row are 45o, 90o and -45o, with respect to x direction in the x-y plane, 
respectively, and their grating periods are 34 m, 48 m and 34 m. The diffraction efficiencies 

 
 
of the regions (i), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) are 93.1%, 89.3%, 85.1%, 89.5%, 82.6%, respectively, 
and the diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 6 (d). 

3.3 HOE 

HOEs are optical elements fabricated by exposing holographic recording materials to interfered 
laser  light.  HOEs  usually  exhibit  high  wavelength  and  angle  selectivity  due  to  their  Bragg 
structure  nature.  For  light  satisfying  Bragg  condition,  a  HOE  can  realize  a  certain  optical 
function like a  grating, a lens or a  mirror [34,35], with high diffraction efficiency. For light 
dissatisfying Bragg condition, however, it is just like a transparent window. Because of these 
characteristics, HOEs have been employed as optical combiners in AR systems [36,37].  

In our experiment, we fabricated a HOE to function as a mirror lens in the optical system. 
Fig. 7(a) illustrates the recording process of the HOE. The HOE sample is placed at the position 
where a spherical wave and a plane wave, coming from opposite sides, interfere. The angle 𝛼 
between reference beam and the  HOE sample plane is approximately 45°, and the spherical 
wave  impinges  on  the  sample  normally.  The  HOE  material  used  in  the  experiment  is  a 
commercial  holographic  film  (Litiholo  C-RT20),  and  the  required  exposure  energy  is  ~30 
mJ/cm2 at the wavelength of 532 nm [38]. In our experiment, we exposed the HOE for half an 
hour. The density of the object beam and reference beam are both approximately 50 mW/cm2. 
The focal length of the lens used for generating the object beam is 100 mm. 

Fig. 7. (a) Recording process and (b) reconstruction process of the HOE. 

The measured diffraction efficiency of the HOE lens is ~60%, and its focal length is ~70 mm. 
To evaluate its imaging quality, collimated light modulated with a letter “A” was projected to 
the HOE as shown in Fig. 7 (b). Fig. 8 (a) shows the focus pattern received on a screen, which 
indicates good focusing ability. And Fig. 8 (b) shows the projected image when the screen is 
placed at a farther distance.

3.4 Prototype implementation and result 

We  implemented  a  proof-of-concept  MV-SMV  display  prototype  according  to  Fig.  3,  and 
achieved 3 × 1 and 3 × 2 viewpoints using the 1D and 2D PBOEs, respectively. The SLM used 
in the experiment is an amplitude-type SLM (Holoeye, LC-R-1080), whose the resolution is 
1920 × 1080 and the pixel size is 8 𝜇𝑚. The RCP in front of the PBOE is to ensure circular 
polarized incidence. Although the diffraction efficiencies of the PB gratings are high, we still 
placed  a  LCP  behind  the  PBOE  to  eliminate  the  zero-order  light  whose  polarization  was 
unchanged. The focal length of the refractive lens is 60 mm. 

The refractive lens and the HOE work together to converge the collimated light beams into 
viewpoints at the pupil position. Fig. 9 (a) shows the photo of the viewpoints received on a 
screen  at  the  exist  pupil  of  the  system  with  3  ×  1  viewpoints.  The  interval  of  the  adjacent 
viewpoints  d  is  ~  0.8  mm  and  the  size  of  each  viewpoint  d0  is  ~0.20  mm.  Since  the  pupil 
diameter of a human eye is usually 4-8 mm, with such small viewpoint intervals the system can 
satisfy the SMV condition. The viewpoint interval d is determined by the deflection angle of 
the PBOE  and the focal length of the lens system (comprised of the refractive and HOE lenses) 
f as 𝑑 = 𝑓tan𝜃, based on the simplified configuration shown in Fig. 10.  

Fig. 9. Photos of the viewpoints at the pupil position: (a) 3 × 1 viewpoints and (b) 3 × 2 viewpoints.  

Fig. 10. Calculation of viewpoint intervals in a simplified configuration. Lens -- the equivalent lens of 
the refractive lens and HOE lens. 

For each view of the MV-SMV, it is a like Maxwellian-viewing display, and should generate 
always-in-focus images  within a large DOF.  To confirm this,  we only displayed the  middle 
view with a letter “A” while showing nothing in the other views. A camera was placed near the 
exist pupil to took photos. As the camera focus was adjusted from near distance to far distance, 
the captured images were always sharp though their sizes varied. Fig. 11 (a) and (b) shows the 
pictures taken when the camera was focused at 20 cm and 200 cm, respectively, for example. 

 
 
 
Fig. 11. Captured images from the middle view when camera was focused at (a) 20 cm and (b) 200 cm. 

When three parallax images (letters “A” and “K” with different intervals) were displayed, 
virtual 3D images could be generated. Here, the virtual image letter “A” was generated at the 
depth of 160 cm, while the letter “K” was at 20 cm. Fig. 12 (a) and (b) shows the photos of the 
virtual 3D images augmented on the real world, when the camera was focused at 20 cm and 
160 cm, respectively. We can see that  when one  of the  letters is clear in focus, the other is 
blurry. The virtual images exhibit the same in and out-of-focus effects as the real objects (an 
aperture at a near distance and a notebook at a far distance). Therefore, this MV-SMV display 
could  indeed  provide  correct  accommodation  depth  cue  for  virtual  3D  images.  Moreover, 
within the large range of depth from 20 cm to 160 cm (or from 5 diopters to 0.63 diopters in 
the form of diopters), we could always observe clear virtual images, indicating a large DOF of 
at least 4.37 diopters. 

Fig. 12. Captured images of the MV-SMV display with 3 × 1 viewpoints when camera was focused at 
20 cm and (b) 160 cm. Captured images of the MV-SMV display with 3 × 2 viewpoints when camera 
was focused at (c) the notebook and (d) the ‘hi’ label. 

We further implemented the system to achieve 3  × 2 viewpoints using the 2D PBOE. Six 
parallax images of letter “A” were projected from different regions of the SLM, respectively. 
Similarly, the light beams were converged to different viewpoints as shown in Fig. 9 (b). When 
camera was focused at the notebook which is 160 cm away, the letter “A” was also clear in 
focus. When the camera was focused at a “hi” label, the virtual image “A” is blurred just as the 
notebook. In this experiment,  with 3  × 2 viewpoints, both horizontal and vertical parallaxes 
were realized, and the full parallax could provide more natural 3D effect. 

4.  Conclusion  

In this study, we developed and demonstrated a MV-SMV near-eye display system based on a 
PBOE. The collimated parallax images are deflected by the PBOE into different directions, and 

 
 
are then converged into viewpoints by the lenses. We implemented the MV-SMV AR display 
with 3  × 1 and 3  × 2 viewpoints,  using a 1D PBOE and 2D PBOE, respectively. The HOE 
serves as both an eyepiece and a  combiner in the AR display system. The spot size  of each 
viewpoint is about 0.2 mm, and the interval of the adjacent viewpoints is about 0.8 mm. The 
small interval ensures the satisfaction of SMV condition that more than one viewpoint should 
be observed by a human eye simultaneously. Thanks to the small size of the viewpoints, the 
system can display 3D images with correct accommodation depth cue within a large DOF of at 
least 4.37 diopters. We believe the proposed MV-SMV display holds great promise for future 
AR display applications.
