A recent rejuvenation of experimental and theoretical interest in the physics of few-
body systems has provided deep, fundamental insights into a broad range of problems.
Few-body physics is a cross-cutting discipline not restricted to conventional subject ar-
eas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular physics. To a large degree, the
recent explosion of interest in this subject has been sparked by dramatic enhancements
of experimental capabilities in ultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which
now permit atoms and molecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit
with controllable two-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic
or electromagnetically-dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows in particular access to
the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering lengths far exceed
all other length scales in the problem. The Eﬁmov eﬀect, where 3 particles experienc-
ing short-range interactions can counterintuitively exhibit an inﬁnite number of bound
or quasi-bound energy levels, is the most famous example of universality. Tremendous
progress in the ﬁeld of universal Eﬁmov physics has taken oﬀ, driven particularly by a
combination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and prior to the
ﬁrst observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical studies dating back to 1970.
Because experimental observations of Eﬁmov physics have usually relied on resonances
or interference phenomena in three-body recombination, this connects naturally with the
processes of molecule formation in a low temperature gas of atoms or nucleons, and more
generally with N-body recombination processes. Some other topics not closely related to
the Eﬁmov eﬀect are also reviewed in this article, including conﬁnement-induced reso-
nances for explorations of lower-dimensionality systems, and some chemically interesting
systems with longer-range forces such as the ion-atom-atom recombination problem.

I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Spectacular recent breakthroughs for the three-body
problem with near-resonant two-body interaction,
in
both experiments and theories, have spawned this review
of universal few-body physics, which concentrates on sys-
tems with ﬁnite-range interactions. Vitaly Eﬁmov’s 1970
prediction (Eﬁmov, 1970) that an inﬁnite family of uni-
versal three-body states should emerge when two or more
two-body scattering lengths are suﬃciently large in mag-
nitude ﬁrst received partial experimental conﬁrmation
in 2006 by Rudi Grimm’s group in Innsbruck (Kraemer
et al., 2006). That development was quickly followed
by many subsequent experiments (Barontini et al., 2009;
Berninger et al., 2011, 2013; Bloom et al., 2013; Dyke
et al., 2013; Ferlaino et al., 2009a, 2008, 2011; Gross et al.,
2009, 2010, 2011; H¨afner et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2014;
Huang et al., 2014a, 2015, 2014b; Johansen et al., 2016;
Knoop et al., 2010, 2009; Kunitski et al., 2015; Lompe
et al., 2010a; Machtey et al., 2012a,b; Maier et al., 2015;
Nakajima et al., 2010, 2011a; Ottenstein et al., 2008;
Pires et al., 2014b; Pollack et al., 2009; Roy et al., 2013;
Tung et al., 2014; Ulmanis et al., 2016a,b; Wacker et al.,
2016; Wang et al., 2016; Wenz et al., 2009; Wild et al.,
2012; Zaccanti et al., 2009; Zenesini et al., 2013) bearing
on various aspects of the Eﬁmov eﬀect and universality.
See Fig. 1. This class of phenomena is called universal be-
cause it can occur for systems with vastly diﬀerent energy
and length scales. While it was originally predicted for
few-nucleon systems such as the triton, with energy scales
of order 106 eV and distance scales of the order of 10−14
m, all of the convincing demonstrations to date have in-
volved energy and distance scales of order 10−12 eV and

2

10−7 m, respectively. Some of the few-body physics top-
ics discussed here have already been reviewed elsewhere,
and the reader is recommended to explore a large body
of literature that can be found in (Baranov et al., 2012;
Blume, 2012a; Braaten and Hammer, 2006; Cˆot´e, 2016;
Frederico et al., 2012; Jensen et al., 2004b; Naidon and
Endo, 2016; Nielsen et al., 2001; Ohsaki and Nakamura,
1990; Petrov, 2012; Rittenhouse et al., 2011b; Suzuki and
Varga, 1998; Wang et al., 2013, 2015a; Yurovsky et al.,
2008; Zinner and Jensen, 2013).

A. Systems with ﬁnite range interactions

It is reasonable to ask why ﬁnding a new family of
resonances has generated such excitement in few-body
physics, excitement that has translated into an exponen-
tially growing rate of citations for the 1970 Eﬁmov pa-
per during the past 15 years.
In fact these resonances
are unique and counterintuitive. For every previously
known example of a system where inﬁnitely many bound
states or resonances exist that converge to a breakup
threshold, the forces were inﬁnite in their extent. The
best known example of this is of course the asymptoti-
cally attractive Coulomb potential V (r) → −1/r which
has an energy level formula En ∝ −1/n2, and a sec-
ond example is the charge-dipole two-body potential
V (r) → −(s2 + 1/4)/2r2 at r > r0 which has (for a
system of units with reduced mass µ = 1) an energy
level formula En = E0 exp(−2πn/s). The presence of a
ﬁnite versus inﬁnite number of quantized levels below a
threshold hinges on the convergence or non-convergence
of the zero-energy JWKB phase integral with Langer cor-
rection included. (Vol.II of (Morse and Feshbach, 1953)
presents a pedagogical derivation of the Langer correc-
tion needed for accurate semiclassical calculations, e.g.
when the independent coordinate domain is semi-inﬁnite
or ﬁnite as is true for the radial coordinate in three-
dimensional problems.) That is, one can deduce the en-
ergy level formula relevant to a given two-body potential
energy function V (r) by evaluating the zero energy total
phase φ = (cid:82) ∞
If this φ is in-
r0
ﬁnite, then the number of converging energy levels will
also be inﬁnite, whereas if φ is ﬁnite then their number
is also ﬁnite. This type of analysis also applies to the re-
cently predicted “super-Eﬁmov eﬀect” (Gao et al., 2015;
Gridnev, 2014; Moroz, 2014; Nishida et al., 2013; Volos-
niev et al., 2014) which is likewise predicted to yield an
inﬁnite sequence of bound (or resonant) levels for a sys-
tem of three fermions in 2 dimensions,(see also (Efremov
et al., 2013)) with a density of states far smaller than in
the original Eﬁmov eﬀect.

(cid:113)

A common thread running through this story is the
fact that hyperspherical coordinate techniques played a
key role in the early theoretical predictions of the Thomas
and Eﬁmov eﬀects in pre-1980 studies, and they have

3

tant, qualitative and semi-quantitative ways to under-
stand the main reaction pathways which govern the cor-
responding physical mechanisms. Despite this headway,
there has not been a comprehensive review or monograph
that has presented the full hyperspherical methodology,
nor has there been one that covered much of the connec-
tions with diverse areas of physics from nuclear systems
to cold atoms to exotic species and atomic electron states,
and one of the goals of the present review is to bridge this
gap in the existing literature.

The concepts of the hyperspherical approach are of
course far from being a new innovation in few-body the-
oretical physics. They go back at least as far as the
pioneering work of Llewellen Hilleth Thomas,(Thomas,
1935) who realized that three nucleons whose ratio of
potential range to scattering length becomes arbitrarily
small, r0/|a| → 0, must have a ground state energy that
“collapses” to E → −∞. The triton model considered by
Thomas is depicted in Fig.2. This was demonstrated by
showing that the eﬀective potential energy of such a sys-
tem, as a function of the hyperradius R (Thomas denoted
this variable as s), has the form −1/R2, a potential that
exhibits the well-known “fall to the center” collapse of its
ground state energy, as is discussed in quantum mechan-
ics textbooks (Landau and Lifshitz, 1997). Another early
application of hyperspherical coordinates framework was
developed by Julian Schwinger’s student at Harvard, R.
E. Clapp, in his PhD thesis work on the triton binding
energy (Clapp, 1949). Fock’s 1958 study of the analyti-
cal nature of the electronic helium atom wavefunction at
small hyperradii also utilized hyperspherical coordinates
in a fundamental way (Fock, 1958).

Figure 2 (Color online) Tritium nucleus model assumed by
Thomas. The neutron-proton interaction is characterized by
a ﬁnite-range potential V (rij), whose range is given by r0, but
the neutron-neutron interaction is neglected (which is known
nowadays to be far from correct). See text for details.

Some of the deepest insights into the nature of the
three-body problem have emerged from Macek’s adia-
batic hyperspherical methodology (Macek, 1968). The
latter consists of a comprehensive theoretical framework
in which the Hamiltonian of the system is initially diago-
nalized at ﬁxed values of the hyperradius R, yielding adi-

trimers in ultracold gases. Panel (a) shows the universal
trimer energy dependence on the inverse two-body scatter-
ing length, i.e. a. In particular, the Eﬁmov trimers cross the
three-body continuum at a(n)
− , where n =1 denotes the Eﬁ-
mov ground state, n = 2 the ﬁrst excited states, etc. Eﬁmov
states intersecting the atom-dimer continuum are character-
ized by a(n)
for the positive two-body scattering length. Panel

tion rates of three identical bosons at low energies versus the

combination occur at scattering length values denoted here as

tracold temperatures, i.e. where Eﬁmov states intersect the

played an equally crucial role in showing later that ul-
tracold quantum gases should provide a powerful way
to observe universal Eﬁmov physics, by linking the Eﬁ-
mov eﬀect quantitatively to the loss process of three-
body recombination. Hyperspherical studies have shown
unusual ﬂexibility, as they have been used on the one
hand with zero-range regularized pseudopotential inter-
actions to obtain closed-form analytical results,(Eﬁmov,
1970, 1971, 1973a, 1979; Kartavtsev and Macek, 2002;
Macek, 1986, 2002; Macek et al., 2005; Mehta et al., 2008;
Nielsen et al., 2001; Nielsen and Macek, 1999; Watanabe
and Komine, 1989) and on the other hand as the basis
for quantitative numerical solutions using ﬁnite-range an-
alytical or numerical three-body Hamiltonians (D’Incao
and Esry, 2005; Esry and Greene, 2006; Esry et al., 1999,
1996a; Suno et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2012a,d). This ﬂex-
ibility has led to a tremendous deepening of our under-
standing of three-body recombination and atom-dimer
elastic and inelastic scattering over the past two decades,
both the quantitative understanding and, equally impor-

EL3(a)(b)V(r12)V(r13)r0abatic curves which represent the energies of the system
as functions of R. These give an immediate, dynamics-
based representation of the available reaction pathways
for any given system, and highlight the emerged struc-
ture of the bound and quasi-bound states of the system
as well as their excitation and decay mechanisms (Fano,
1976, 1983; Lin, 1986, 1995). Coupling matrix elements
can also be computed which permit, as is shown in this
review article, a systematic solution of the full three-
body Schr¨odinger equation to the accuracy desired for
arbitrary bound state problems as well as two-body in-
elastic and rearrangement collisions (A+BC), three-body
collisions (A+B+C), and photon-assisted collision pro-
cesses (Fink and Zoller, 1985).

B. Coulomb Systems

The three-body problem in quantum mechanics
with Coulomb interactions has generated intense eﬀort
throughout the past century. Early in the days of the
“old quantum theory”, it was a major problem to un-
derstand the ground and excited states of the helium
atom. With Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics, in combina-
tion with other tools such as the Ritz variational method,
it became possible by the 1930s to calculate properties
of such low-lying states in the three-body Coulomb prob-
lem to high precision. For higher excited states lying in
the two-body or three-body continua, however, progress
was much slower. The ability to nonperturbatively cal-
culate the simple process of electron impact ionization
of hydrogen at low energies (< 1 eV) above the double
escape threshold, for instance, did not emerge until the
1990s (Bartlett et al., 2003; Kadyrov et al., 2009; Kato
and Watanabe, 1995; McCurdy et al., 1997; Robicheaux
et al., 1997), although important theoretical work prior
to that had identiﬁed the unusual threshold behavior for
two-electron escape (Fano, 1983; Greene and Rau, 1982,
1983; Klar and Schlecht, 1976; Peterkop, 1971; Rau, 1984;
Read, 1984; Selles et al., 1987; Wannier, 1953; Watanabe,
1991). Analogous theoretical headway occurred over that
same period for other three-body observables, such as
double photoionization of He and H− (Meyer and Greene,
1994; Meyer et al., 1997; Robicheaux et al., 1997). Of
course long before the quantal version of the three-body
problem became topical, the Newtonian version with in-
verse square forces had acquired paramount importance
and was singled out by researchers such as Poincar´e and
Hilbert as a crucial bottleneck that had to be solved.

Early eﬀorts on systems with Coulomb interactions
by Macek, Lin, and Fano demonstrated that signiﬁ-
cant insights into the qualitative and semiquantitative
nature of doubly-excited states of He and H− emerge
when an adiabatic hyperspherical approximation is im-
plemented (Fano, 1976; Lin, 1986; Lin and Morishita,
2000; Macek, 1968). Surprisingly high doubly-excited

4

states of two-electron atoms can be treated in the adi-
abatic scheme, as seen for calculations of high states
which yielded a simple interpretation of regularities seen
in photoabsorption (Domke et al., 1991; RAU, 1992;
Sadeghpour and Greene, 1990; Tang et al., 1992). Ex-
tensions to other atomic systems such as the alkaline
earth atoms (Greene, 1981) and the negative ion of
helium (Watanabe, 1982) were also developed, which
showed that nonadiabatic couplings often need to be in-
corporated in order for the results to be even qualitatively
useful (Christensen-Dalsgaard, 1984). The exploration of
near-separability of the two-electron wavefunction in al-
ternative choices of coordinates, which yields nontrivial
insights in some cases, was reviewed by (Tanner et al.,
2000).

Another arena where three-body Coulombic interac-
tions have been subjected to intensive study has been in
the context of muon-catalyzed fusion (Hino and Macek,
1996). Interesting studies of the dtµ reaction of impor-
tance for muon-catalyzed fusion were carried out, for in-
stance, using hyperspheroidal coordinates (Fukuda et al.,
1990; Hara et al., 1988). Another hyperspheroidal co-
ordinate application was to HD+ by Macek and Jer-
jian (Macek and Jerjian, 1986) and by Hara et al. (Hara
et al., 1989) Some of the most suitable systems for an adi-
abatic representation in hyperspherical coordinates are
those with two or more equal mass particles, such as the
ion formed from two electrons and one positron, i.e. the
positronium negative ion (Botero and Greene, 1985, 1986;
Fabre de la Ripelle, 1993). Also, not to be overlooked is
the fact that this approach can be made quantitatively
accurate, in some cases with direct solution of the cou-
pled hyperradial equations in the adiabatic representa-
tion (Kadomtsev et al., 1987).

In fact the adiabatic representation has challenges as
the system grows in complexity and in the number of
relevant coupled hyperradial equations, and for such sys-
tems the clever recasting as a set of diabatic equations,
called the “slow-variable discretization” (SVD) method
proposed by Tolstikhin et al. (Tolstikhin et al., 1996),
improves the eﬃciency enormously. When propagation
to very large hyperradii is required in order to obtain
accurate scattering information, a hybrid method (Wang
et al., 2011a) has proven to be quite eﬃcient and accu-
rate, which uses SVD at small to intermediate hyperradii
but solves the direct coupled adiabatic equations at very
large hyperradii. One of the most recent applications
of the SVD hyperspherical treatment is an investigation
of the famous Hoyle triple-α resonance by (Suno et al.,
2015).

Other exotic examples of three-body Coulombic sys-
tems
that have been studied include the antipro-
ton+hydrogen atom system, explored by (Esry and
Sadeghpour, 2003), which gives an idea of the prototypi-
cal hyperspherical potential curves that emerge from ap-
plying the adiabatic hyperspherical method to the ¯ppe

of the diﬀerent symmetries of this 5-body system, and
they also describe the lowest energy scattering processes.

exist in this system. The states shown in the energy range
displayed here are mostly of the type “anti-hydrogen plus elec-
tron”. Note that the energy and hyperradius are displayed
respectively here on an “eﬀective quantum number scale”
ν ≡ (−mU (R))−1/2 with m the proton mass, and square
root hyperradial scale R1/2, reﬂecting the usual scaling in
a Coulomb potential. For instance ν = 1 corresponds to the
energy of the ground 1s state of the hydrogenic ¯pp state on
this scale. Adopted from (Esry and Sadeghpour, 2003).

system, as is shown in Fig. 3. A huge number of inter-
acting channels are evident, which might initially seem
hopelessly daunting in complexity. Closer inspection
shows, however, that most of the curve crossings are
highly diabatic, and the diabatic potential curves are
remarkably simple, suggesting approximately conserved
quantum numbers. Further examples of such simplicity
emerging for a seemingly complex system will be demon-
strated throughout the present review. Some exciting
headway in treating four-body Coulomb systems has also
occurred during the last few decades, notably by Mor-
ishita, Lin, and collaborators, (D’Incao, 2003; Morishita
and Lin, 1998, 1999; Morishita et al., 1997) in a ro-
bust improvement over primitive early studies (Clark and
Greene, 1980; Greene and Clark, 1984). A small num-
ber of treatments have extended adiabatic hyperspheri-
cal ideas to more than four particles, although they are
still at a relatively primitive state at this time (Blume
and Greene, 2000; Bohn et al., 1998; Daily and Greene,
2014; Kim and Zubarev, 2000; Kushibe et al., 2004; Mor-
ishita and Lin, 2005; Rittenhouse et al., 2006; Ritten-
house and Greene, 2008; Sogo et al., 2005). Fig. 4 shows
an example of the lowest potential energy curves obtained
by (Daily and Greene, 2014) for a system of 3 electrons
and 2 positrons. These potentials contain bound states

Early interest in three-body continuum states in
Coulombic systems was mainly triggered by a desire
to understand electron impact ionization of atoms, es-
pecially in the low energy range, through phenomena
such as the Wannier-Rau-Peterkop threshold law for that
process derived initially through entirely classical argu-
(Wannier, 1953) and later conﬁrmed through
ments
quantum mechanical and semiclassical arguments by
(Peterkop, 1971, 1983; Rau, 1971). Experimental con-
ﬁrmations of this unusual irrational threshold law for
a process with both electrons escaping from a residual
particle of positive charge Ze, namely σ ∝ Eγ where
γ = 1
4Z−1 )1/2 − 1], were measured for electron im-
pact ionization of atomic helium by (Cvejanovic and
Read, 1974) and for two-electron photodetachment of H−
(Donahue et al., 1982)(both for z = 1, γ = 1.127...). Go-
ing beyond the double escape threshold law proved to
be highly challenging, with some of the ﬁrst credible ab-
solute cross sections from a theoretical calculation, for
the fundamental e + H → e + e + p process, emerging
ﬁrst in the numerical “convergent close-coupling” stud-
ies by (Bartlett et al., 2003; Bray and Stelbovics, 1993;
Kadyrov et al., 2009), performed in ordinary indepen-
dent electron coordinates. One of the ﬁrst studies that
obtained competitively accurate results within a hyper-
spherical coordinate framework was that of (Kato and
Watanabe, 1995, 1997), and it was followed by a subse-

quent detailed study by (Kazansky et al., 2003; Malegat,
2003, 2004; Selles et al., 2004). Highly quantitative re-
sults are also now obtained for this two-electron escape
process by direct solution of the time-independent (Mc-
Curdy et al., 2004) or time-dependent (Pindzola and Ro-
bicheaux, 1998; Pindzola et al., 2007) Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. Recent years have seen extensive interest in the
time-reversed process: three-body recombination. For a
low-temperature plasma consisting of electrons and pro-
tons, this is the reaction e + e + p → H(nl) + e (Pohl
et al., 2008; Robicheaux, 2007; Robicheaux et al., 2010)
or its antimatter analog with positrons and antiprotons;
this mechanism underpins recent exciting progress in the
formation of antihydrogen (Andresen et al., 2010, 2011).

C. Chemical Physics

Another class of studies that has utilized a 3-body hy-
perspherical solution to solve a challenging problem in
chemical physics is the dissociative recombination (DR)
of H +
3 (Kokoouline and Greene, 2003; Kokoouline et al.,
2001; Petrignani et al., 2011). To describe the DR pro-
cess where an electron collides with H +
3 and the ﬁnal
state dissociates into H2 + H or H + H + H, the use
of hyperspherical coordinates has both a practical com-
putational advantage and a qualitative conceptual ad-
vantage. For instance, the theory of DR is much bet-
ter understood for a diatomic target than for a poly-
atomic target, so the use of an adiabatic hyperspherical
representation of the nuclear positions ultimately maps
polyatomic DR theory back in terms of more familiar
diatomic DR theory. Those studies also showed that a
nontrivial rearrangement collision can be controlled by
conical intersection dynamics, more speciﬁcally in this
case the Jahn-Teller eﬀect. Part of that solution was a
description of the incident electron channels as well as
the energetically-closed Rydberg channel pathways using
multichannel quantum defect techniques, which will not
be discussed in detail here but are summarized elsewhere
in the literature (Kokoouline et al., 2011).

In chemical physics, some of the most impressive theo-
retical studies of few-atom reactive scattering have been
carried out using a hyperspherical coordinate framework.
See for instance an early treatment by (Kuppermann and
Hipes, 1986) of H+H2 scattering.
In 1985, experimen-
talists Neumark and coworkers perform a groundbreak-
ing study(Neumark et al., 1985) of the famous F+H2 →
F H + H reaction, which required several years before a
converged theoretical treatment using hyperspherical co-
ordinates in a variant of Macek’s adiabatic representation
- the diabatic-by-sector method - was developed by Lau-
nay and coworkers (Launay and Dourneuf, 1990). Other
studies of importance in hyperspherical treatments of re-
active scattering were developed by (Pack and Parker,
1987, 1989). However, other studies of important re-

6

arrangement reactions were carried out using Jacobi or
other coordinates, such as the calculation by (Neuhauser
et al., 1991), but our focus in this article is primar-
ily on methodologies that ultimately boil down to solv-
ing one or a coupled set of one-dimensional hyperradial
Schr¨odinger equations. A simple and popular method for
solving such coupled 1D diﬀerential equations is the log-
derivative method (Johnson, 1973; Manolopoulos et al.,
1993), while a more advanced technique frequently uti-
lized when there are many close avoided crossings in the
potential curves has been developed by (Tolstikhin et al.,
1996) and implemented in various studies such as (Wang
et al., 2011a).

A handful of studies have even gone beyond three-atom
processes and computed scattering cross sections for re-
actions involving four-atoms using hyperspherical (Clary,
1991) or other methods (Bohr et al., 2014). These studies
can be viewed as solutions to the few-body Schr¨odinger
equation, starting from the Born-Oppenheimer potential
energy surface as a function of the internuclear coordi-
nates. Of course a number of important reactive systems
have two or more fundamentally coupled potential sur-
faces, with or without conical intersections, and these re-
quire further sophistication even in formulating the basic
Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian governing the coupled
electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.

D. Fragmentation, recombination, and molecule formation

The general theory of nuclear reactions was formulated
in hyperspherical coordinates in a useful set of papers by
(Delves, 1959, 1960), who showed that the usual unitary
scattering matrix can be deﬁned in general by inspect-
ing the asymptotic form of the ﬂux-conserving solution at
large hyperradii. Hyperspherical coordinates were picked
up by Smirnov and others in the Soviet school of nu-
clear physics, and that work is reviewed in an extremely
practical and general article by (Smirnov and Shitikova,
1977). The work of that school concentrated on the de-
velopment of non-interacting solutions in the hyperan-
gular degrees of freedom, the so-called hyperspherical
harmonics, including a graphical way to construct the
solutions, and the analog of fractional parentage coeﬃ-
cients to achieve their antisymmetrization when applied
to several fermionic particles such as nucleons (Smirnov
and Shitikova, 1977). This has been developed further
in nuclear collision theory by (Barnea, 1999; Barnea and
Novoselsky, 1997) and by (Nielsen et al., 2001) More re-
cently, a model treatment of elastic nucleon scattering
of the type A + A2 has shown that there is a signiﬁcant
beneﬁt from adopting adiabatic hyperspherical ideas in
the calculation, particularly if the theory is implemented
using integral relations for the scattering amplitudes that
are developed by (Barletta and Kievsky, 2008, 2009; Bar-
letta et al., 2009).

The variant of the three-body problem involving short-
range forces, particularly relevant in nuclear physics, has
served as an independent but equally important testing
ground for theory. Whereas in ultracold atomic physics it
is a recombination process such as A + B + C → AB + C
that is of greatest interest, which can form a diatomic
molecule in a gas of free atoms, in nuclear physics it
is more typically the time reverse of recombination, i.e.
AB +C → A+B +C whose reaction rates and scattering
amplitudes are of interest in laboratory experiments and
in astrophysical contexts. An early study by (Thomas,
1935) showed that the range r0 of two-body nuclear forces
cannot be made arbitrarily smaller than the nucleon-
nucleon scattering lengths ann(S = 0) = −18.9 fm,
anp(S = 0) = −23.7 fm, anp(S = 1) = 5.43 fm, because
the three-nucleon ground state would become arbitrarily
deep and plummet all the way to −∞ in the limit r0 → 0,
a behavior never observed experimentally, of course, but
which is now referred to as the “Thomas collapse” ef-
fect. Interestingly, however, one sees that the scattering
lengths are generally much larger in magnitude than the
known range r0 ∼ 1 − 2 fm of the nucleon-nucleon strong
force. Another intriguing foray into the behavior of three
particles interacting via short range forces came decades
later from Eﬁmov, who predicted an eﬀect that bears
some connection with the Thomas collapse eﬀect: Eﬁ-
mov predicted that for a system of three particles having
inﬁnite two-body scattering lengths, there must be an
inﬁnite number of 3-body bound levels that become ar-
bitrarily weak in their binding. Eﬁmov’s work went on to
predict that in the limit where three equal mass particles
have common interparticle scattering lengths a, the num-
ber of such universal bound levels becomes ﬁnite and is
truncated to the approximate value N ≈ 1
π ln(|a|/r0).
These levels are called universal because they depend
only on the dimensionless ratio between the scattering
length and the distance r0 beyond which the two-body in-
teractions are negligible, and in some cases an additional
parameter is needed, such as the “three-body parameter”
discussed below in Sec. III.

The recombination process that occurs when three ul-
tracold atoms collide, e.g. A + A + A → A2 + A in
a Bose-Einstein condensate, became a particularly im-
portant topic in the ﬁeld of degenerate quantum gases
in the mid-1990s, when it was increasingly realized that
this was the dominant loss process in most experiments.
The reason was that most of the experimental ingenu-
ity had been directed towards turning oﬀ inelastic two-
body losses by cleverly designing the quantum states of
the trapped atoms. This left little possibility to further
turn oﬀ inelastic three-body losses, although the gases
in real experiments were usually suﬃciently dilute that
the quantum gas produced could be studied for reason-
able periods of time, usually from 0.1 - 100 s. The pro-
cess of three-body recombination was studied in a per-
turbative treatment by Verhaar and collaborators for the

7

case of spin-polarized atomic hydrogen (de Goey et al.,
1986); the rate coeﬃcient for the process is only of order
10−38cm6/s, i.e. of extremely low probability because
it requires a spin ﬂip via magnetic interactions. For
more typical systems such as alkali atoms that recom-
bine in an ultracold gas, an application of the Verhaar
approach (Moerdijk et al., 1996; Moerdijk and Verhaar,
1996) predicted that the recombination rate should scale
overall as a2, i.e. as the square of the atom-atom scat-
tering length a.

In fact the growth of the recombination rate coeﬃcient
K3 with a was eventually shown to be much faster than
quadratic. The ﬁrst promising step towards a deeper un-
derstanding of three-body recombination emerged from a
study by (Fedichev et al., 1996a) that predicted that the
true scaling of K3 should vary much more strongly with
scattering length, as a4. Sparked by growing interest
throughout the ultracold science community in the need
for a deeper understanding of three-body recombination,
two nonperturbative treatments of this process at large
two-body scattering lengths were published in 1999, one
by Nielsen and Macek (Nielsen and Macek, 1999) and
the other by Esry et al. (Esry et al., 1999). While these
1999 Letters conﬁrmed the (Fedichev et al., 1996b) pre-
diction of an overall a4 scaling of the three-body recombi-
nation rate coeﬃcient K3, they both found an additional
Stueckelberg interference modulation with the encourag-
ing potential to cause destructive interference at some
very large values of a, potentially beneﬁcial for experi-
ments where loss needs to be minimized.
In addition,
(Esry et al., 1999) predicted that an inﬁnite number of
resonances should periodically enhance the recombina-
tion rate at large negative a, and that these resonances
are Eﬁmov states that have become unbound and merged
into the three-body continuum. In the case of homonu-
clear three-body recombination, those “zero-energy” res-
onances are predicted to have an approximate geometric
scaling in the scattering length, with each successive Eﬁ-
mov resonance occurring at a two-body scattering length
that is approximately eπ/s0 ≈ 22.7 times larger than the
preceding one.

Following these initial predictions, subsequent theoret-
ical studies extended and ampliﬁed them, e.g. as re-
viewed with a focus on the hyperspherical coordinate
point of view by several articles (Greene, 2010; Nielsen
et al., 2001; Rittenhouse et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2013,
2015a,a).
Importantly, alternative treatments found
largely similar conclusions using methods such as eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld theory (Bedaque et al., 2000; Braaten and Ham-
mer, 2001, 2003, 2006), a separable interaction applica-
tion of eﬀective ﬁeld theory (Shepard, 2007), two exactly
solvable models (Gogolin et al., 2008; Macek et al., 2006;
Mora et al., 2011) and the treatment by (K¨ohler, 2002;
Lee et al., 2007) that adopted the early theoretical nu-
clear physics treatment of (Alt et al., 1967). All of these
explorations added tremendously to conﬁdence in the

theory community that the Eﬁmov eﬀect should be ob-
servable, despite the dearth of experimental conﬁrmation
prior to 2006.

Then, however, this ﬁeld received a tremendous in-
jection of excitement in 2006 when recombination rate
measurements for a Cs gas by Grimm’s Innsbruck group
(Kraemer et al., 2006) observed the aforementioned Eﬁ-
mov resonance in the three-body rate coeﬃcient K3 at
a large negative scattering length, in agreement with the
1999 prediction (Esry et al., 1999). That study provided
the ﬁrst experimental conﬁrmation of the Eﬁmov eﬀect.
The scattering length dependence of measured recombi-
nation rates in that 2006 experiment closely resembled
the predicted shape (Esry et al., 1999) for a three-body
Eﬁmov resonance, but a skeptic might argue that obser-
vation of one resonance alone might not be convincing
evidence of its Eﬁmov character. However, subsequent
observations of three-body recombination in numerous
systems have solidiﬁed, conﬁrmed, and extended that in-
terpretation beyond any doubt. The most dramatic sig-
nature has been observing multiple resonances, separated
by the predicted Eﬁmov factor of 22.7 in the scattering
length, and multiple predicted interference minima, sep-
arated by that same universal factor (Braaten and Ham-
mer, 2006; Esry et al., 1999; Greene, 2010; Nielsen and
Macek, 1999).

− = a(1)

A further unexpected level of universality emerged
from experimental studies with three-atom recombina-
tion. The three-body parameter had been thought by
virtually all theorists to occur “randomly”, and to vary
widely from system to system. The three-body parame-
ter can be viewed as setting the energy E0 of the lowest
Eﬁmov state at a = ∞ (unitarity), or alternatively, as
the smallest scattering length a(1)
− at which a zero-energy
Eﬁmov resonance occurs and thus sets the location of all
subsequent resonances through the universal scaling for-
mula, a(n)
− e(n−1)π/s0. The remarkable surprise was
experimental evidence from the Grimm group (Berninger
et al., 2011) and several others (Dyke et al., 2013; Gross
et al., 2009, 2010, 2011; Roy et al., 2013; Wild et al.,
2012) which showed that for homonuclear three-body sys-
tems dominated by van der Waals (vdW) −C6r−6 two-
body interactions at long range, an approximate van der
Waals universality ﬁxes a(1)
− ≈ −10(cid:96)vdW in terms of the
characteristic length (cid:96)vdW ≡ [mC6/(16(cid:126)2)]1/4. As Fig. 5
shows, the three-body parameter is ﬁxed to within ap-
proximately 15% by this simple relation. Shortly after
this experimental evidence was published, a theoretical
interpretation emerged from (Wang et al., 2012a) which
showed that a classical suppression of the two-body prob-
ability density whenever two-particles approach to within
r < (cid:96)vdW produces an eﬀective hyperradial barrier that
restricts three-body motion at R < 2(cid:96)vdW and sets the
three-body parameter. To clarify, there is a classical sup-
pression because the probability of a classical particle

ence of an attractive van der Waals force, the velocity
increases suddenly and dramatically when the interpar-
ticle distance r decreases to less than the van der Waals
length, causing this probability density to plummet in
such regions. The existence of the hyperradial barrier was
subsequently conﬁrmed and extended in further studies
by (Naidon et al., 2014a,b, 2012) which stressed particu-
larly that a key element of this van der Waals universality
is a change from a very ﬂoppy equilateral to a roughly
linear geometry that occurs near R ≈ 2(cid:96)vdW; the geom-
etry change then triggers strong non-Born-Oppenheimer
repulsion and suppresses the three-body solution at all
smaller hyperradii in the relevant potential curve. An
alternative toy model addressing the implications of two-
body van der Waals forces on the three-body approxi-
mate universality has also been published as a preprint
by (Chin, 2011). Other treatments aimed at this issue
of three-body parameter universality that start from a
two-channel or narrow two-body resonance point of view
are presented in (Schmidt et al., 2012; Sørensen et al.,
2012; Wang and Julienne, 2014).

Figure 5 (Color online) Three-body parameter scaled by (cid:96)vdW
for three equal mass particles. Speciﬁcally, this quantity is the
value of the (negative) atom-atom scattering length at which
the ﬁrst universal Eﬁmov resonance is observable in a zero en-
ergy three-body recombination process. The error bars have
been calculated as the weighted mean of the experimental
results reported in Sec.III.

The case of heteronuclear universal Eﬁmov physics ap-
pears to be signiﬁcantly more complicated, e.g.
for the
particularly interesting case of heavy-heavy-light (HHL)
systems that exhibit more favorable Eﬁmov scaling than
for the homonuclear three-body systems. But a degree of
van der Waals universality has been predicted in (Wang
et al., 2012d) to still be relevant for the “Eﬁmov favored”
HHL case. The complexity grows for these heteronuclear
systems because more parameters control the universal-
ity, namely two van der Waals lengths and a mass ratio,
and the universal energy spectrum now depends on two

6Li7Li39K85Rb133Cs051015|a-(1)|/RvdWscattering lengths that are uncorrelated in general. Nev-
ertheless, early experimental evidence from two diﬀer-
ent experimental groups (Pires et al., 2014b; Tung et al.,
2014; Ulmanis et al., 2016a) suggests that this general-
ized van der Waals universality for HHL systems is at
least approximately valid, but still deserves careful study
in the future. A very recent experimental preprint (Jo-
hansen et al., 2016) suggests that for Eﬁmov physics near
a narrow two-body Fano-Feshbach resonance in the 6Li-
133Cs-133Cs system, the universal van der Waals theoret-
ical predictions developed for Eﬁmov physics in the HHL
system near a broad two-body resonance (Wang et al.,
2012d) will require very substantial modiﬁcations, e.g.
by implementing a multichannel model for the two-body
interaction Hamiltonian as in (Kartavtsev and Macek,
2002; Mehta et al., 2008; Wang and Julienne, 2014). For
light-light-heavy (LLH) three-body systems, Ref. (Wang
et al., 2012d) stresses that these are “Eﬁmov-unfavored”,
and it is unlikely that a true Eﬁmov state will be observ-
able experimentally.

E. Recombination processes involving cluster resonances
with more than three particles

A detailed discussion of universal four-boson and ﬁve-
boson energy levels and recombination resonances is
given below in subsection III.G, but here we point out
some of the basic issues involved in describing cluster
resonances in systems of N > 3 identical bosons having
short-range interactions. Most of these systems have a
pairwise attractive long-range interaction and a strong
short-range repulsion, as in the case N bosonic helium
atoms. Simple counting then shows that in the rela-
tive coordinate system the number of positive terms in
the kinetic energy operator is proportional to (N − 1)
whereas the number of net attractive terms in the pair-
wise potential energy is equal to N (N − 1)/2. Thus,
one expects that if one is in a negative region of the
two-body scattering length a where 3 particles are not
quite attracted strongly enough to bind a universal trimer
state, there could be a value of the negative scattering
length a = a−
4B where 4 or more particles are able to
bind. Similarly, if one goes to a region where 4 parti-
cles are not quite strongly enough to be bound, there
should be a negative value of a = a−
5B. One can explore
this theoretically either by varying the two-body poten-
tial strength to modify the scattering length,(Gattobigio
et al., 2012; Nicholson, 2012; von Stecher, 2010, 2011;
Yamashita et al., 2010; Yan and Blume, 2015) or by arti-
ﬁcially changing the particle mass in the calculations for
a ﬁxed two-body potential, which also modiﬁes the repul-
sive/attractive balance in the Hamiltonian (Hanna and
Blume, 2006). This concept has been studied in a num-
ber of studies,and some universal aspects have already
emerged. In particular, the most recent careful discus-

9

sion by (Yan and Blume, 2015) gives evidence that for
general short-range two-body interactions, such as gaus-
sians or other short-range potentials, the N -body cluster
energies at unitarity a → ∞ are not uniquely speciﬁed
since they depend on the type of “three-body regulator”
implemented. However, there does appear to be a quasi-
universality that emerges in the case of van der Waals
two-body interactions: the cluster bound state energies
at unitarity are then approximately ﬁxed in terms of the
van der Waals length scale.

These and other developments will be addressed in the
remainder of this review, including a detailed description
of the techniques, while stressing methods of interpretive
analysis that have been utilized to study these univer-
sal phenomena from a hyperspherical coordinate perspec-
tive. A very recent treatment of universal 5-body bound
states in a mass-imbalanced fermionic system has been
developed by (Bazak and Petrov, 2016) using alternative
(integral equation) techniques (Pricoupenko, 2011).

II. ADIABATIC HYPERSPHERICAL TREATMENT

A Schr¨odinger wave equation for N interacting parti-
cles, with masses mi moving in 3 dimensions per particle,
becomes in the absence of external ﬁelds, a d = 3N − 3
dimensional partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) in the
relative coordinate system. When expressed in hyper-
spherical coordinates, a single scalar coordinate, the hy-
perradius R deﬁned below, is singled out for special treat-
ment within an adiabatic formulation. It is possible in
general to formally transform the d−dimensional PDE,
speciﬁcally the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation
ˆHΨ = EΨ for any potential energy function dependent
on the relative position coordinates only, into an inﬁnite
set of ordinary coupled diﬀerential equations in a single
adiabatic coordinate R. Moreover, a conceptual advan-
tage of hyperspherical coordinates is that every possible
fragmentation mode for any system of particles occurs in
the limit R → ∞.

The basic equations of the adiabatic representation
are simple to derive. First of all, write the full time-
independent Hamiltonian in the form

ˆH = ˆTR + HR=const,

(1)

where the term HR=const depends on R only as a param-
eter and is a Hermitian partial diﬀerential operator in
all other (hyperangular) coordinates of the system plus
spins, denoted collectively here as {(cid:36)}. Next, solve the
eigenvalue equation at each value of R:

HR=constΦν(R; (cid:36)) = uν(R)Φν(R; (cid:36)).

(2)

The exact eigenfunctions of the full ˆH can now be ex-
panded into the complete, orthonormal set of eigenfunc-

tions Φν(R; (cid:36)) with R-dependent coeﬃcients FEν(R), as

ΨE(R; (cid:36)) = R−(d−1)/2 (cid:88)

Φν(R; (cid:36))FEν(R),

giving an inﬁnite set of coupled diﬀerential equations for
the hyperradial functions:

where µ is the N -body reduced mass and its explicit form
is given in Eq. (9). Observe that for a coordinate space
with d dimensions, the hyperradial kinetic energy oper-
ator has the form ˆTR = − (cid:126)2
∂R , and the
2µ
rescaling of the radial function eliminates the ﬁrst-order
derivative of FEν(R) on the left-hand side of Eq.(4). The
rescaling also adds what Fano called a “mock-centrifugal
term” to uν(R), giving the full eﬀective hyperradial Born-
Oppenheimer potential as

where the
double bracket notation signiﬁes an integral (and spin
trace) only over the (cid:36) degrees of freedom. This set
of coupled equations is sometimes treated in the hyper-
radial Born-Oppenheimer approximation which neglects
the right-hand side of Eq. (4).
In that approximation,
the system moves along a single potential energy curve
with no possibility of changing from one potential to an-
other, and this approximation of course has no possibility
of describing an inelastic collision. But in some cases it
can give a reasonable description of energy levels and
scattering phaseshifts, although in most cases a more ac-
curate result is obtained by retaining (except near close
avoided crossings) the diagonal terms of Eq. (4) which
is usually referred to as the hyperspherical adiabatic ap-
proximation.

While the hyperradial Born-Oppenheimer approxima-
tion, which considers only a single term in the expansion
for ΨE in Eq. (4), is often reasonable, a far richer set of
phenomena emerges when nonadiabatic coupling eﬀects
are incorporated, either by direct solution of the cou-
pled radial equations or else using semiclassical methods
such as Landau-Zener-St¨uckelberg or their improvements

10

along the lines of (Nikitin, 1970; Zhu et al., 2001). This in
fact yields a quantitative description of phenomena such
as three-body or four-body recombination, and inelastic
atom-dimer or dimer-dimer scattering.

The following development sketches one explicit ver-
sion of this recasting of the Schr¨odinger equation into
hyperspherical coordinates for an N-particle system in 3
dimensions. Note that a similar development for N 2D
particles is presented by (Daily et al., 2015b), in the con-
text of the quantum Hall eﬀect. One ﬁrst transforms the
N laboratory frame position vectors {(cid:126)ri} in terms of a
suitable set of N − 1 mass-weighted relative Jacobi coor-
dinate vectors {(cid:126)ρi}, plus the center of mass vector which
is trivial and is therefore ignored throughout. Extensive
arbitrariness and ﬂexibility exists for the choice of the
Jacobi coordinate vectors, but for deﬁniteness, one sim-
ple choice is based on choosing the j−th Jacobi vector
as the (reduced-mass weighted) relative vector between
particle (j + 1) and the center of mass of the preceding
group of particles 1 through j, i.e.:

(cid:113) µ12

(cid:126)ρ1 =
(cid:113) µ12,3

µ ((cid:126)r2 − (cid:126)r1)
µ ((cid:126)r3 − m1(cid:126)r1+m2(cid:126)r2

m1+m2

(cid:126)ρ2 =

... etc., where the N − 1 Jacobi reduced masses are

µ12 =

m1m2
m1 + m2

, µ12,3 =

(m1 + m2)m3
m1 + m2 + m3

, ...etc.,

(8)

and where the N -body reduced mass is

µ = (µ12µ12,3....)

1
N −1 .

(9)

Alternative choices for the overall reduced mass µ are
possible and are sometimes utilized, but this choice in
Eq.(9) is particularly desirable in many contexts because
it preserves the overall volume element. With these def-
initions, the nonrelativistic kinetic operator acquires a
simple form, namely

ˆT = −

The Cartesian coordinates of all these Jacobi vectors can
thus be collected into a single d-dimensional relative vec-
tor x
≡ {x1, x2, x3, ...xd}, and these can in turn be trans-
¯
formed into hyperspherical coordinates by deﬁning the
hyperradius R as the radius of the d-dimensional hyper-
sphere:

R =

There are again many possible choices for the d − 1
hyperangles αk, but one simple generalization of our
usual spherical coordinates is implied by the chain(Avery,

1989):

xd = R cos αd−1
xd−1 = R sin αd−1 cos αd−2

Now, the nonrelativistic kinetic energy operator in hy-

These equations now show how the physics of this d-
dimensional problem can be mapped exactly onto an adi-
abatic representation in the single coordinate R, with po-
tential energy curves Uν(R) and nonadiabatic coupling
terms as in standard Born-Oppenheimer theory.
As
is particularly stressed by (Fano, 1981b, 1983; Macek,
1968), and as we document below, this approach yields
tremendous insights in many physical systems.

Some examples of applying the adiabatic hyperspher-
ical representation to systems with many particles are
summarized below in Sec.(IV). But before turning to
examples, we show how far greater symmetry and sim-
plicity emerge from a clever choice of the hyperangles
for three-particle systems, N = 3, by adopting a “body-
ﬁxed” coordinate system of the type suggested by (Whit-
ten and Smith, 1968). The particular variant described
here adopts the conventions speciﬁed by (Suno et al.,
2002).

Usually we are interested in three-body systems that
have exact separability in the relative and center of mass
coordinates, whereby the relative degrees of freedom can
be described by six coordinates, i.e. d = 6 is the full
dimensionality of this space. Three of these coordinates
are conveniently chosen to be Euler angles {α, β, γ} that
connect the body-ﬁxed frame to the space-ﬁxed frame.
Three remaining coordinates in this system are the hy-
perradius R and two hyperangles θ and ϕ. Following

µ2 =

m1m2m3
m1 + m2 + m3

.

(18)

In this expression, particle i with mass mi has position
(cid:126)ri. When the three particles have identical mass m, the
parameters simplify to ∆ = (4/3) 1
3. And
specializing the above deﬁnition of the hyperradius R, it
is given here by:

4 and µ = m/

√

R2 = ρ2

1 + ρ2
2,

0 ≤ R < ∞.

(19)

The hyperangles θ and ϕ are determined by the four
nonzero components of the two Jacobi vectors in the body
frame x − y plane by

((cid:126)ρ1)x = R cos(θ/2 − π/4) sin(ϕ/2 + π/6),
((cid:126)ρ1)y = R sin(θ/2 − π/4) cos(ϕ/2 + π/6),
((cid:126)ρ2)x = R cos(θ/2 − π/4) cos(ϕ/2 + π/6),
((cid:126)ρ2)y = −R sin(θ/2 − π/4) sin(ϕ/2 + π/6),

(20)

where by deﬁnition ρ1z = 0 = ρ2z. For deﬁniteness, note
that the x, y, and z right-handed coordinate system of
the body-ﬁxed frame is chosen such that the z axis is
parallel to (cid:126)ρ1 × (cid:126)ρ2, and the x axis is that with the small-
est moment of inertia. The ranges of the hyperangles are
0 ≤ θ ≤ π
2 and 0 ≤ ϕ < 2π (Kendrick et al., 1999). If the
three equal mass particles are in fact truly identical, then
the hyperangle ϕ can be further restricted to the range
[0, 2π/3]. Note that in this case, the interaction potential
is symmetric under the operation ϕ → π/3−ϕ. Then the
bosonic or fermionic symmetry of the Schr¨odinger solu-
tions under exchange of any two particles is particularly
simple to impose as a boundary condition in these coordi-
nates. The volume element for integrals over |Ψ|2 is equal
to dV ≡ d(cid:36)R5dR = 2 sin 2θdθdϕdα sin βdβdγR5dR, and
the Euler angle ranges are 0 ≤ α < 2π, 0 ≤ β < π,
0 ≤ γ < π. The full Schr¨odinger equation for the rescaled
wavefunction ψE = R5/2Ψ describing three identical par-
ticles now takes the form

The total orbital angular momentum operator in the
body frame is denoted here as (cid:126)L = {Lx, Ly, Lz}. For an
interacting 3-body system, one frequently adopts a sum
of two-body potential energy functions for V (R, θ, ϕ),
but some explorations are carried out with explicit non-
pairwise additive terms as well. That is, most explo-
rations of universal physics have used an approximate
3-particle V of the form:

V (R, θ, ϕ) = v(r12) + v(r23) + v(r31),

(26)

where rij are the interparticle distances. For three equal
mass particles, these distances are expressed in terms of
the hyperspherical coordinates as

r12 = 3−1/4R[1 + sin θ sin(ϕ − π/6)]1/2,
r23 = 3−1/4R[1 + sin θ sin(ϕ − 5π/6)]1/2,
r31 = 3−1/4R[1 + sin θ sin(ϕ + π/2)]1/2.

(27)

As was indicated above, the ﬁrst step in implementing
the adiabatic representation is to solve the ﬁxed-R adi-
abatic eigenvalue equation for a given symmetry LΠ to
obtain the ﬁxed-R adiabatic eigenfunctions (Φν, some-
times referred to as channel functions) and eigenvalues
(potential energy curves Uν(R)). Here we adopt an ab-
breviated notation with Ω ≡ (θ, ϕ, α, β, γ) and for some
systems Ω includes spin degrees of freedom as well. For
the body-frame choice of hyperangles, it is simplest to
expand the Euler angle dependence of the Φν in terms of
normalized Wigner D-functions, ˜DL

M K(αβγ), i.e. as

ΦLΠ

ν (R; Ω) =

(cid:88)

K

φKν(R; θ, ϕ) ˜DL

M K(αβγ).

(28)

ν

This representation guarantees that ΦLΠ
is automatically
an eigenfunction of (cid:126)L2, and it is also an even (odd) eigen-
function of the parity operator ˆΠ provided K is restricted
to even (odd) values respectively. A few more details of
this body frame representation are useful when using this
representation to convert the 5-dimensional PDE Eq.(21)
into a set of coupled 2D PDEs in θ, ϕ only. In this body
frame representation of angular momentum, the raising

L± ˜DL

M,K(αβγ) = (cid:112)(L ∓ K)(L ± K + 1) ˜DL
M,K(αβγ) = K ˜DL

M,K(αβγ).

M,K±1(αβγ)

After inserting the above expressions, one obtains for
each value of {L, M, Π} a ﬁnite number of coupled 2D
PDEs in θ, ϕ. The terms involving L2
y cause
couplings between components K and K ±2. While these
PDEs are for complex solutions, as written here, it is
possible to take linear combinations, e.g. φK(R; θ, ϕ) ±
φ−K(R; θ, ϕ) and reformulate the PDEs in terms of real
functions everywhere.

A. Recombination cross sections and rate coeﬃcients

It was proven by Delves that the hyperspherical rep-
resentation preserves the usual desired properties of con-
tinuum scattering solutions, such as ﬂux conservation
when the Hamiltonian is Hermitian which ensures uni-
tarity of the scattering matrix S and symmetry of the
S-matrix when the Hamiltonian is time-reversal invari-
ant. One simple conceptual aspect of Macek’s adiabatic
hyperspherical representation involving potential energy
curves and nonadiabatic couplings is that the compu-
tation of the unitary S-matrix can utilize any of the
powerful techniques already developed for treating two-
body inelastic scattering processes. In other words, just
as in standard multichannel scattering theory (Rodberg
and Thaler, 1970) or multichannel quantum defect the-
ory (Aymar et al., 1996; Burke et al., 1998; Fano, 1970;
Gao, 2001; Greene and Jungen, 1985; Mies, 1984; Mies
and Raoult, 2000; Ruzic et al., 2013; Seaton, 1983), one
simply propagates solutions of the coupled equations in
Eq. (4) out to large distances, ﬁts to linear combination of
energy-normalized regular and irregular radial functions
{fEν(R), gEν(R)} and in this manner obtain a real, sym-
metric reaction matrix Kνν(cid:48)(E) characterizing solutions
from some large matching radius R0 out to inﬁnity:

ΨEν(cid:48)(R; (cid:36)) =

(cid:88)

ν

Φν(R; (cid:36))
R(d−1)/2

(fEν(R)δνν(cid:48) − gEν(R)Kνν(cid:48))

(30)
Then linear combinations of those solutions can be taken
to enforce any appropriate boundary conditions at R →
∞ for the observable quantities of interest (Aymar et al.,
1996; Fano and Rau, 1986). The usual relations are ob-
tained for quantities like S = (1+iK)(1−iK)−1 with ex-
tra long range phase factors sometimes needed to satisfy

outgoing-wave or incoming-wave boundary conditions.
(See, e.g. Sec.II of (Aymar et al., 1996).) Of particu-
lar interest in the context of ultracold quantum gases is
the three-body recombination rate coeﬃcient which was
derived in (Esry et al., 1999). The relevant formula for
three identical bosonic particles which are in a thermal
gas rather than a BEC, after correcting for a factor of 6
error in the formulas reported in that paper, is:

K3(E) =

(cid:126)k
µ

192π2
k5 Σν(cid:48)ν|Sν(cid:48),ν|2

(31)

Here k = (cid:112)2µE/(cid:126)2 and the sum includes all entrance
three-body continuum channels (A+A+A, ν) for the
symmetry of interest, and over all ﬁnal state two-body
bound channels (A2+A, ν(cid:48)). A few words are relevant to
explain how this recombination rate coeﬃcient is to be
used in rate equations used to model this reaction in a
cold gas. This quantity K3(E) is the fundamental coef-
ﬁcient relevant to a single triad of particles in the gas.
The coeﬃcient in the rate equations for disappearance of
atoms or appearance of dimers is another rate coeﬃcient,
L3, which is determined by the following points. If one
imagines that there are N atoms in a thermal gas vol-
ume V , then there are gN = N (N − 1)(N − 2)/3! ≈ N 3/6
distinct triads of the type A+A+A in the system. If we
deﬁne a density as n ≡ N/V , then the rate equation for
disappearance of atoms from a cold trapped gas is

dn
dt

= −L3n3,

(32)

gN
N 3 ≈ K3
where for a thermal trapped gas, L3 = 3K3
2 .
In this last equation, the leading factor of 3 in the mid-
dle is the number of atoms lost in each recombination
event, and the value 3 reﬂects the fact that for a typical
trapped gas of atoms, a recombination event releases so
much kinetic energy that both the ﬁnal dimer and the
ﬁnal atom following recombination will be ejected, i.e.
all three of the initially free atoms. If an unusually deep
trap is implemented, or if the binding energy of the dimer
produced is far less than the trap depth, then that factor
of 3 would of course be changed to 2 since only the dimer
would escape the atom trap, though one should then also
keep track of the energy deposited into the cloud by the
remaining hot atom. As is also well known, (Burt et al.,
1997; Kagan et al., 1985; S¨oding et al., 1999) if the initial
atom cloud is in a pure BEC rather than a thermal gas,
then the preceding K3 needs to be reduced by a factor of
3!.

Some of the simplest and most important early pre-
dictions of the low energy recombination rate behavior
include an expected a4 scaling (Fedichev et al., 1996b),
which was later seen to be modiﬁed in a nontrivial way
that diﬀers depending on whether the atom-atom scat-
tering length a is positive (Esry et al., 1999; Nielsen and
Macek, 1999) or negative (Esry et al., 1999). If a is large

13

+

/a(i)

and positive, then there exists a weakly bound dimer
state whose energy is approximately −(cid:126)2/ma2, and the
recombination rate into that universal dimer channel
should have St¨uckelberg interference minima at scatter-
ing lengths a(i)
+ whose spacings should scale geometrically

If instead, a is negative, then this implies that

there is no weakly-bound universal dimer, and recom-
bination can occur only into deeper nonuniversal dimer
channels. On this side, even though the attraction is not
strong enough to bind two atoms together into a univer-
sal dimer, the Eﬁmov eﬀect can bind trimers at certain
values of a(i)
− < 0. Moreover, the successive values of
a where a trimer can form at zero energy also obey the
Eﬁmov scaling, a(i+1)
− ∼ 22.7. While the ﬁrst exper-
iments (Berninger et al., 2011, 2013; Dyke et al., 2013;
Ferlaino et al., 2009a, 2008, 2011; Gross et al., 2009, 2010,
2011; Knoop et al., 2010, 2009; Machtey et al., 2012a,b;
Pollack et al., 2009; Zaccanti et al., 2009; Zenesini et al.,
2013) were only able to observe a single Eﬁmov reso-
nance (i = 1) for homonuclear systems, a recent impres-
sive experiment by (Huang et al., 2014b) has observed
the i = 1, 2 resonances and conﬁrmed their approximate
ratio to be close to Eﬁmov’s predicted value.

Much subsequent theory has treated the physics of re-
combination, and developed compact analytical formulas
within the framework of zero-range models and/or eﬀec-
tive ﬁeld theory, which are particularly convenient for
analyzing experimental data. See for instance the fol-
lowing references (Braaten and Hammer, 2006; Gogolin
et al., 2008; Macek et al., 2006; Mora et al., 2011). A
diﬀerent direction of extending and generalizing recom-
bination theory has been the treatment of recombination
processes for N > 3 particles. A generalization of Eq.(31)
presented above for recombination of N identical bosons
into any number of bound fragments is derived in (Mehta
et al., 2009):

KN (E) = N !

(33)

Here d is the number of dimensions in the relative coor-
dinate space after eliminating the trivial center-of-mass
motion, i.e. for N particles in 3 dimensions, d = 3N − 3.
This last formula of course reduces to the above expres-
sion for K3 when N = 3.

III. THE BIRTH OF FEW-BODY PHYSICS: THE
EFFECTS OF THOMAS AND EFIMOV

A. The Thomas collapse

In the early days of nuclear physics, in 1935, a mere
three years following the Chadwick discovery of the neu-
tron, L. H. Thomas published a seminal work about the
structure of the triton, 3H (Thomas, 1935). In particular,

Thomas studied the existence of the triton ground state
obtained with diﬀerent assumptions for the neutron-
proton interaction, but neglecting neutron-neutron inter-
actions as it is depicted in Fig. 2. As a result, (Thomas,
1935) found that the neutron-neutron potential energy
should have a repulsive character at short range, and that
the neutron-proton interaction cannot be conﬁned to a
distance very small compared with 1 fm. These ﬁndings
constitute the very ﬁrst exploration of few-body physics
with ﬁnite range forces, and they sparked the interest of
many physicists in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics, especially
atomic physics and molecular physics in addition to nu-
clear physics.

The key point of (Thomas, 1935) is that it is possible
to account for nucleon-nucleon (or atom-atom) interac-
tions having an arbitrary scattering length a with many
diﬀerent two-body interaction models. For a two-body
model with arbitrarily short range r0 there must be a
corresponding potential depth of order (cid:126)2/2mr2
0 in order
to yield a value of a that is independent of potential range
and ﬁxed at an experimentally measured value. For in-
stance, in a spherical square well model having depth V0
and range r0, the zero-energy two-body scattering length
for two equal mass particles of mass m and reduced mass
m/2 is equal to a = r0 − tan qr0/q, where q = (cid:112)mV0/(cid:126)2.
As r0 is decreased to smaller and smaller values, q must
increase approximately in proportion to 1/r0 in order to
maintain any given ﬁxed scattering length. Thomas then
examined the nature of the three-body ground state en-
ergy in this limit of decreasing potential range r0 but
ﬁxed two-body scattering length. The qualitative argu-
ment is rather simple, namely that when a third particle
is brought into the system having equal scattering lengths
a, this adds two new potential energy terms to the Hamil-
tonian of the same depth and range, while only adding
one new kinetic energy term. As a result, the three-
body system is shown by Thomas to have a ground state
energy that must be of order −(cid:126)2/mr2
0, which becomes
arbitrarily large and negative as r0 → 0.

B. Eﬁmov physics and universality in ultracold gases

Eﬁmov considered an analogous three-body prob-
lem which also involved two-body scattering lengths a
much larger in magnitude than the potential range, i.e.
|a|/r0 >> 1, except that Eﬁmov visualized the two-body
interaction range r0 to be ﬁxed, and |a| → ∞.

Three identical particles with resonant two-body inter-
action will show an inﬁnite series of three-body bound
states as predicted by Eﬁmov (Eﬁmov, 1970, 1971,
1973b) more than 40 years ago. This inﬁnity of trimer
states follows a discrete symmetry scaling, i.e., the en-
ergy of the n-th and n + 1-th states are related through
En+1 = λ2En, where for the particular case of three
identical bosons λ = eπ/s0 with s0 = 1.0062 (Braaten

14

and Hammer, 2006; Eﬁmov, 1970; Ferlaino et al., 2011;
Greene, 2010; Wang et al., 2013), and hence λ ≈ 22.7.
Eﬁmov introduced the universal theory of three-body
collisions thinking in nuclear systems as the preferable
scenario for the quest of his predictions. However, the
ﬁrst experimental evidence of the prediction of V. Eﬁ-
mov came from ultracold gases (Kraemer et al., 2006),
and this early evidence has triggered an explosive growth
in research into few-body ultracold physics.

In ultracold systems the exciting capability to tune
two-body atomic scattering length, using magnetic, opti-
cal or RF-induced Fano-Feshbach resonances (Chin et al.,
2010; Hanna et al., 2010; Inouye et al., 1998; K¨ohler et al.,
2006; Owens et al., 2016; Tscherbul et al., 2010). This
tunability of ultracold system Hamiltonians makes them
perfect candidates to study few-body universality. How-
ever, the formation of universal trimers must be detected
and characterized in such systems. The most usual route
to such detection is to measure the three-body loss coef-
ﬁcient L3 as a function of the two-body scattering length
a, as is schematically shown in Fig.1. Speciﬁcally, the
universal Eﬁmov trimers cause an enhancement of L3 at
a given two-body negative scattering length a(n)
− , and the
Eﬁmov physics exhibits interference minima at values of
the positive two-body scattering length a(n)
+ , as shown in
Fig.1. Eﬁmov states can also be studied by radiative or
oscillatory ﬁeld association, as has been achieved in 6Li
by (Lompe et al., 2010b; Nakajima et al., 2011b) and in
7Li by (Machtey et al., 2012b).

C. Faddeev equations for three identical bosons: bound
states

1. Hamiltonian and Faddeev operator equations

In the following three spinless and equal mass particles
of bosonic character are considered which interact via
short range ﬁelds. Note that the notation introduced be-
low for deriving the Faddeev equations follows (Gl¨ockle,
2012). Then the total Hamiltonian for three s-wave in-
teracting bosons obeys the following form:

H = H0 + ˆV23 + ˆV31 + ˆV12,

(34)

where H0 is the three-body kinetic operator, ˆVij indi-
cates the short range potential between the i−th and
j−th particle. For simplicity the following notation is
introduced ˆVi ≡ ˆVjk with cyclic permutation of (i, j, k).
The three-body Schr¨odinger equation reads:

(H0 +

(cid:88)

i

ˆVi)Ψ = EΨ

(35)

where Ψ indicates the three-body wave function. Em-
ploying now the three-body non-interaction Green’s func-
tion, i.e. ˆG0 ≡ [E − H0]−1, Eq. (35) can be recast to the

following form:

2. Faddeev equations in momentum representation

ψ(2)

+ ˆG0 ˆV3Ψ
(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)
ψ(3)

.

(36)

where this holds as long as the Green’s function is free
of poles. In our case this is valid since we focus on the
description of three-body bound states, i.e. the energy of
any bound state is negative while the zeroth-order Hamil-
tonian has only kinetic energy and is positive deﬁnite.
As Eq. (36) illustrates the total three-body wavefunc-
tion Ψ can be decomposed in three components, namely
Ψ = (cid:80)
i ψ(i) with i = 1 . . . 3 where each ψ(i) indicates the
i-th Faddeev component of the total three-body wave-
function Ψ. Physically, the i-th Faddeev component,
i.e.ψ(i) implies that the i−th particle is a spectator parti-
cle with respect to the interacting pair (j, k). Employing
this decomposition ansatz in Eq. (36) yields a system
of three coupled Faddeev equations which describe the
bound state properties of the three-body system.

where the term ˆti represents the two-body transition
operator. More speciﬁcally, ˆti obeys the following
Lippmann-Schwinger equation:

ˆti = ˆVi + ˆVi ˆG0ˆti, for i = (1, 2, 3)

(38)

where the term ˆG0 denotes the Green’s function of three
non-interacting bosons. This implies that the transition
operator ˆti is considered as a two-body operator embed-
ded in a three-body Hilbert space.

The Faddeev equations in Eq. (37) can be decoupled by
taking into account the exchange symmetry between the
three particles. Formally the exchange symmetry can be
addressed by a permutation operator Pij which permutes
the i-th with the j − th particle. In addition, the con-
sidered system consists of three identical bosons there-
fore the total wavefunction Ψ is symmetric. Due to this
the exchange operator only permutes the particles in the
Faddeev components. By using the permutation oper-
ator, a pair of Faddeev components (ψ(j), ψ(k)) can be
expressed in terms of ψ(i) and vice versa. The ψ(i) com-
ponent of the Faddeev equations in Eq. (37) then takes
the following form:

(39)

where the indices (i, j, k) form a cyclic permutation.

Eq. (39) represents the operator form of the Faddeev
equations and in the following Eq. (39) is expressed in
momentum space. For completeness reasons in the fol-
lowing the Jacobi coordinates and the corresponding mo-
menta are brieﬂy reviewed.

Consider that the motion of three bosonic particles
with masses mi with i = 1 . . . 3 are described by the
lab coordinates xi whereas their corresponding momen-
tum is ki with i = 1 . . . 3. Then in order to describe the
relative motion of three particles the following three sets
of Jacobi coordinates are introduced:

ρi = xi −

mjxj + mkxk
mj + mk

and ri = xj − xk,

(40)

where (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3) form a cyclic permutation and the
Jacobi vector ri denotes the relative distance between the
j-th and k-th particles whereas the vectors ρi indicate the
distance of the i-th particle, i.e. the spectator particle,
from the center of mass of the (j, k) pair of atoms. Note
that the coordinate of the center of mass of three particles
obeys the simple relation R = (cid:80)3
i=1 mixi/M where M =
(cid:80)3

i=1 mi denotes the total mass of the system.
Similarly, for the Jacobi momenta we obtain the fol-

lowing relations:

qi =

mkkj − mjkk
mj + mk

and pi =

(mj + mk)ki − mi(kj + kk)
M

,

(41)
where (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3) form a cyclic permutation, the qi
denotes the relative momentum of (j, k) pair and the pi
indicates the momentum of the spectator particle relative
to the center of mass of (j, k) pair. The total momentum
is given by the relation P = (cid:80)3

i=1 ki.

According to these deﬁnitions the kinetic operator ˆH0

in the momentum space takes the following form

H0 =

P 2

q2

(42)

where µi = (mjmk)/(mj +mk) is the reduced mass of the
(j, k) pair particles and ¯µi = mi(mj + mk)/M denotes
the reduced mass of the spectator particle and the center
of mass of the (j, k) pair.

In the following is assumed that the collisions occur in
the frame of the total center of mass, this means P = 0.
Therefore, the term P 2/(2M ) can be removed from the
total Hamiltonian which then takes the form:

H (cid:48) =

Since the Jacobi coordinates and momenta are in-
troduced, the reduced Faddeev equation (see Eq. (39))
can be transformed into the momentum space. For
this purpose a certain set of Jacobi momenta is chosen,
i.e.(p1, q1). This means that in this particular set of Ja-
cobi coordinates the particle 1 is the spectator of the pair

the Yamaguchi potential (Yamaguchi, 1954). This par-
ticular type of potentials simpliﬁes the Faddeev equations
[see Eq (48)] into an one-dimensional integral equation.
Assume that the two particles interact via s-wave inter-
actions only through the following non-local potential:

1(cid:105) = −

λ

where λ denotes the strength of the two-body interac-
tions, m indicates the mass of the particles and the χ(·)
functions are the so called form factors. Typically, the χ-
form factors are chosen such that the potential V yields
the same scattering length and eﬀective range correction
as the real two body interactions. Note that since we
are interested in three-body bosonic collisions of neutral
atoms in the following subsection we provide the form
factors χ which are derived from a van der Waals poten-
tial. This particular choice of form factor incorporates in
a transparent way the pairwise two-body interactions of
the three neutral atoms.

After insertion of Eq. (46), the two-body transition
matrix elements for the separable potential in Eq. (49)

where for a particular choice of χ−form factors the pre-
ceding equation is transformed into a matrix equation.
For a given s-wave scattering length and eﬀective range
parameters, numerically the energy is varied in searching
for roots of the corresponding determinantal equation of
Eq. (53).

Finally, it should be noted that replacement of the
χ-form factor by χ(q1) → 1 in the reduced Faddeev
equation in Eq. (51) one obtains the Skorniakov-Ter-
Martirosian equation (Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian,
1957) for three bosons colliding with zero-range s-wave
interactions. The following subsection focuses on deriv-
ing a separable potential which is suitable for the two-
body interactions of neutral atoms, i.e. van der Waals
forces.

D. Separable potentials for van der Waals pairwise
interactions

In order to study the universal aspects of the three
body spectrum of bosonic gases it is necessary to focus
on the two-body interactions which govern the collisional
behavior of ultracold gaseous matter. More speciﬁcally,
it is well known that neutral bosonic atoms at large sep-
aration distances experience an attractive van der Waals
type of force which asymptotically vanishes as ∼ −1/r6.
Note that we ignore the Casimir-Polder modiﬁcation due
to retardation,(Casimir and Polder, 1948) which modi-
ﬁes this at very long range but is largely irrelevant to
the energy scale of interest here. This particular type
of interaction potential imprints universal features onto
the corresponding wavefunction (Flambaum et al., 1999;
Gao, 1998) which becomes manifested in the spectra of
three interacting bosons.

However, as was shown in the previous subsection, the
Faddeev equations are best simpliﬁed by using the sep-
arable potential approach. Thus it is of major interest
to construct a separable potential which encapsulates the
main features of the van der Waals forces. (Naidon et al.,
2014a,b) show that such a potential can be derived simply
by using the analytically known zero-energy wave func-
tion of two particles in the presence of van der Waals po-
tential (Flambaum et al., 1999). Namely, the zero-energy
two-body wavefunction for van der Waals interaction is

where as is the s-wave scattering length, (cid:96)vdW =
2 (mC6/(cid:126)2)1/4 is the van der Waals length scale with C6
1
being the dispersion coeﬃcient. The quantities Γ(·) and
(·) represent the Gamma and Bessel functions respec-
J± 1
4
tively.

Fig. 6 depicts the wavefunction in Eq. (54) for an s-
wave scattering length as = 50(cid:96)vdW. At short distances
the two-body wavefunction oscillates fast enough which
in essence reﬂects the fact that the van der Waals po-
tential contains many two-body bound states. At large
distances the wave function of Eq. (54) obtains the form
φ(r) → 1 − r/as. It is evident that a separable potential
based on the above mentioned two-body wavefunction
contains the correct behavior of the two-body wavefunc-
tion as well as eﬀective-range eﬀects due to the short-
range oscillatory part of φ(r). The latter is of particular
importance since (Naidon et al., 2014a,b) demonstrate
that the universality of the three body parameter of the
Eﬁmov states relies exactly on the short-range oscillatory
part of the two-body wavefunction. The Yamaguchi po-
tential from Eq. (49) is adopted, where the χ-function in
the momentum space is deﬁned by:

χ(q1) = 1 − q1

where φ(r) is the zero-energy two-body rescaled radial
wavefunction (see Eq. (54)). Note that the argument
of the χ-form factor depends only on the magnitude of

the vector q1 due to the s-wave character of the wave-
function. The strength λ of the Yamaguchi potential is
determined by the following expression:

As an example, Fig. 7 illustrates the binding energies
versus the s-wave scattering length, as. The two-body
dimer energies within the separable potential approxima-
tion, see Eq. (57), (red dotted line) are compared with
the eﬀective range theory of van der Waals interactions
given by (Flambaum et al., 1999) (blue solid line). The
yellow solid line indicates the universal dimer energies.
Evidently, Fig. 7 depicts that the separable potential
introduced in Eq. (57) captures the essential two-body
physics beyond the eﬀective range approximation.

E. The Eﬁmov spectrum and its universal aspects

(blue line and dots) and the ﬁrst excited (orange line and
dots) three-body state. The black dashed line is the uni-

dimer binding energies calculated within the separable van
der Waals potential approach.

Substitution of Eqs. (55) and (56) for the non-local in-
teraction in Eq. (49) speciﬁes a separable potential which
mimics a van der Waals interaction between two neutral
atoms. Namely, the van der Waals separable potential in

This subsection focuses on the impact of van der Waals
forces on the Eﬁmov spectrum of three identical s-wave-
interacting bosons, the typical situation for three ultra-
cold atoms but irrelevant for the few-nucleon problem.
In particular, the reduced Faddeev equation in Eq. (44)
is numerically solved within the separable potential ap-
proximation. The separable potential is constructed ac-
cording to the prescription given in the previous subsec-
tion. Speciﬁcally, use of the potential in Eq. (57) en-
sures that it contains all the relevant zero-energy infor-
mation about the van der Waals potential. Under these
considerations, Fig. 8 depicts the Eﬁmov spectrum of
three neutral atoms as a function of the s-wave scattering
length. In particular, the blue curve and dots indicate the
ground Eﬁmov trimer state. The orange dots and curve
denote the ﬁrst excited state. The black dashed curve
refers to the universal dimer threshold, i.e., E = − (cid:126)2
,
ma2
s
whereas the green dotted curve corresponds to the two-
body binding energies given for the potential in Eq. (57).
Deeply in the regime of unitarity, namely |as| → ∞, the
trimer energies for the ground and ﬁrst excited state are
E1 = 0.035338 (cid:96)−2
vdW respec-
tively, or in wave vectors we have that κ1 = 0.1879 (cid:96)−1
vdW
and κ2 = 0.00817 (cid:96)−1
vdW. For the ﬁrst two κ wave
vectors a scaling factor is obtained which is equal to
κ1/κ2 = 22.9988. The latter deviates from the universal
scaling law obtained within the zero-range approxima-
tion which is given by the relation κZR
2 = 22.6944.
This discrepancy between the van der Waals approach
and the zero-range approximation can be attributed to
the fact that the latter method completely neglects eﬀec-
tive range corrections. Speciﬁcally, the ground Eﬁmov
state is strongly inﬂuenced by ﬁnite range eﬀects in the
two-body interaction potentials (Ji et al., 2015). Note
that the value obtained for κ0 is in reasonable agreement
within 16% with the corresponding calculation in (Wang
et al., 2012a), which was based on a local position space

core van der Waals potential tail (Wang et al., 2012a)
obtains the value κ0 = 0.226(2) (cid:96)−1

ground Eﬁmov state.

Away from unitarity and for negative values of the
scattering length, Fig. 8 shows that the trimer states
cross the three body threshold and become resonances

mov state is in good agreement with the hyperspheri-
cal approach employed by Wang et al.

In
− = −9.73(3) (cid:96)vdWfor the ground Eﬁmov state.
addition, the Naidon et al. model result agrees well
with the corresponding experimental values, i.e. a(1)
− =
−9.1 (cid:96)vdW (Ferlaino et al., 2011). Remarkably, the
separable potential model presented by (Naidon et al.,
2014a,b) reproduces the universal features of the Eﬁmov
spectrum without utilizing any auxiliary parameter of the
type that is needed within the zero-range approximation.
Recall that the three-body spectrum for the Eﬁmov eﬀect
is not bounded from below in the zero-range approxima-
tion; thus an additional parameter (three-body parame-
ter) is employed in order to deﬁne properly the “ground
Eﬁmov state”. In the van der Waals separable potential
model the auxiliary parameter becomes unnecessary due
to the fact that the potential itself describes not only
the asymptotic behavior of the two-body wavefunction
but also its behavior at short distances which oscillates
rapidly.
Indeed, the fast oscillations of the two-body
wavefunction in regions of the three-body conﬁguration
space where two particles approach each other translates
into an eﬀective repulsive hyperradial barrier, which in
return suppresses the probability to ﬁnd three bosons at
distances less than R ∼ 2 (cid:96)vdW. This suppression eﬀect
was initially understood by (Wang et al., 2012a) using
the hyperspherical approach where the steep attraction of
the van der Waals forces leads to an eﬀective three-body
potential barrier at this somewhat surprisingly large hy-
perradius.

In order to illustrate this point from the reduced Fad-
deev equation in Eq. (49) the three-body wavefunction
is ﬁrst obtained in the momentum representation at a(1)
− .
Then following a Fourier transformation the correspond-
ing conﬁguration space three-body wavefunction is ex-
pressed in hyperspherical coordinates. After integrating
the density over all the hyperangles α, taking the square
root and applying the hyperradius kinetic operator to
the resulting hyperradial wavefunction, an eﬀective po-
tential is obtained as a function of the hyperradius R.
This eﬀective potential is compared with the correspond-

Q00. Fig. 9 compares the resulting implied hyperradial
potential curve from (Naidon et al., 2014b) with the di-
rect adiabatic hyperspherical solution from (Wang et al.,
2012a), showing good general agreement. The gray dot-
ted curve illustrates the asymptotic −R−2 Eﬁmov poten-
tial curve at unitarity for comparison. While the eﬀec-
tive potential curve possesses some additional structure,
(Naidon et al., 2014b) states that this structure is an ar-
tifact which mainly arises from the oscillatory behavior
of the Faddeev three-body wavefunction.

F. Eﬁmov states in homonuclear systems

1. 6Li

Ultracold gases of fermionic 6Li have been the object
of diﬀerent studies about Eﬁmov physics and universal-
ity in three-body physics, e.g. by (Huckans et al., 2009;
Lompe et al., 2010a; Nakajima et al., 2010, 2011a; Otten-
stein et al., 2008; Wenz et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009).
It should be pointed out that it is a bit of a stretch to in-
clude the 6Li system in our discussion of the Eﬁmov eﬀect
for three identical bosonic atoms. Owing to the fermionic
nature of 6Li there is no s-wave scattering between atoms
in identical spin substates, but atoms in diﬀerent sub-
states do have an s-wave scattering length. The studies
just quoted have in fact considered atoms in three distin-
guishable substates, but unlike the case of three identical
bosons, the three interparticle scattering lengths are in

general diﬀerent in the 6Li system. However, they are all
large and negative and therefore the system can be ap-
proximately mapped onto and compared with an Eﬁmov
system with three identical bosons in identical spin sub-
states. In the following discussion, it should be kept in
mind that this mapping is an approximation. It is argued
by (Wenz et al., 2009) that one conjectured mapping, a
deﬁnition of an eﬀective “homonuclear” scattering length
aave that applies when all three interspecies scattering

Nevertheless, quantities in Eﬁmov physics such as the
loss to deeply bound dimers and the three body param-
eter should more rigorously be understood to depend
in general on all three separate scattering lengths for a
fermionic atom such as 6Li, i.e. on a12, a23, a13. In gen-
eral, many of the experimental investigations have relied
upon radio-frequency (RF) techniques for the identiﬁca-
tion of Eﬁmov trimers. These methods employ RF pulses
to form diﬀerent Eﬁmov states, which are detected as
atom loss, thus leading to the characterization of their
binding energies (Lompe et al., 2010a; Nakajima et al.,
2010, 2011a; Wenz et al., 2009). The measured trimer en-
ergies show a clear dependence on the applied magnetic
ﬁeld close to the two-body Feshbach resonances, which
has been viewed as evidence for deviations from Eﬁmov’s
universal three-body physics scenario . In particular, the
geometric scaling factor λ =22.7 is not observed between
successive resonances, and this has been interpreted as a
magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the three-body parameter.
The apparent non-universality of 6Li has been an open
question in the last decade, leading two diﬀerent non-
universal models beyond non-universal two-body inter-
actions (Nakajima et al., 2010). However, (Huang et al.,
2014a) have shown that accounting for a realistic two-
body energy dependent scattering length and taking into
account ﬁnite temperature eﬀects the three-body param-
eter for 6Li turns out to be a(1)
− /(cid:96)vdW = −7.11 ± 0.6
which is very similar to the results obtained for identical
bosons Table I and Table II. Moreover, the geometric
scaling factor shows a 10% deviation with respect to λ =
22.7; the universal expected value.

2. 7Li

The Eﬁmov physics in bosonic 7Li has been extensively
studied through characterizations of maxima and min-
ima of the three-body loss coeﬃcient (Dyke et al., 2013;
Gross et al., 2009, 2010, 2011; Machtey et al., 2012a;
Pollack et al., 2009), as well as using radio-frequency
ﬁelds to measure the binding energies of weakly bound
trimers (Machtey et al., 2012b). In particular, the Rice
group identiﬁed the ground Eﬁmov state for 7Li in the

20

|mF = 1(cid:105) hyperﬁne state as a resonance in the three-body
loss coeﬃcient for a < 0. An initial suggestion in (Pol-
lack et al., 2009) that they had also observed the ﬁrst
excited Eﬁmov resonance a(2)
− was later attributed to a
calibration error. The recalibration, published in (Dyke
et al., 2013), also corrected the position of the ﬁrst Eﬁ-
mov resonance to a(1)
− = -252 ±10. Eﬁmov physics was
also observed on the a > 0 branch of the spectrum as the
expected minima in the three-body loss coeﬃcient (Pol-
lack et al., 2009), yielding a(1)
+ = 1420
± 100 when the recalibration of (Dyke et al., 2013) was
applied. The ratio a(2)
+ = 16 ± 2 deviates apprecia-
bly from the expected universal ratio of 22.7,(Esry et al.,
1999; Nielsen and Macek, 1999) but this level of devia-
tion for the ﬁrst two Eﬁmov features is not unexpected,
based on theoretical calculations.

Similar results for the maxima of the three-body loss
rate were obtained by Gross et al. (Gross et al., 2009,
2010, 2011) for two diﬀerent hyperﬁne states: |mF = 1(cid:105)
and |mF = 0(cid:105) as shown in TableI. However diﬀerent re-
sults for a(1)
+ in comparison with (Pollack et al., 2009)
were obtained as displayed in Table I. This discrepancy
for a(1)
+ has been explained as a distinct magnetic ﬁeld-
scattering length conversion through a diﬀerent charac-
terization of the same Feshbach resonance (Gross et al.,
2010). In Table I it is also observed the universal char-
acter of the three-body parameter a(1)
− in terms of the
van der Waals length (cid:96)vdW for 7Li-7Li.
In particular,
the values obtained for a(1)
− /(cid:96)vdW are very similar to the
values observed in cesium (Berninger et al., 2011), rubid-
ium(Wild et al., 2012) and potassium (Roy et al., 2013).

3. 39K

The study of Eﬁmov states in bosonic 39K at ultracold
temperatures has been developed mainly by the LENS
group (Roy et al., 2013; Zaccanti et al., 2009). In par-
ticular, the study of (Roy et al., 2013) is a remarkable
exploration of the a(1)
− three-body parameter universality,
even including narrow Feshbach resonances. This study
was carried out by employing diﬀerent spin states mF , as
well as diﬀerent Feshbach resonances in an ultracold gas
of 39K, some showing open-channel dominance while oth-
ers are narrower closed-channel-dominated resonances.

length scale and associated with it, the resonance strength

well as the initial temperature T , which implies a saturation
limit of the three-body recombination rate because the S-
matrix is unitary.

et al., 2010) i.e., narrow resonances, have an intrinsic
length scale R∗ = (cid:126)2/(mabgδµ) (Chin et al., 2010), where
abg represents the background scattering length, m is the
reduced mass and δµ is the change in the magnetic mo-
ment between the initial and ﬁnal states. In such a sce-
nario was predicted that the Eﬁmov physics would be
dominated by the intrinsic length associated with the
resonance R∗, in particular, a(1)
− = −12.90R∗ (Gogolin
et al., 2008; Mora et al., 2011; Petrov, 2004). However,
(Roy et al., 2013) revealed a
the experimental work of
completely diﬀerent behavior, as shown in Table II, where
the three-body parameter |a(1)
− |/(cid:96)vdW ∼ 10, which turns
out to be very similar to the experimental and theoretical
values for the case of broad 2-body resonances (Berninger
et al., 2011; Naidon et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2012b),
i.e., |a(1)
− |/(cid:96)vdW = 9.5. This striking result implies that
the intrinsic length scale associated with a narrow reso-
nance apparently plays no role in the determination of
the three-body parameter. Thus, for systems with long-
range dominant van der Waals interactions, the three-
body parameter seems to be universal.

The study of Tan’s contact in an ultracold gas of 85Rb
In particular
has been realized by (Wild et al., 2012).
the two-body and three-body contact were determined,
as well as the three-body recombination rate constant,
by varying the two-body scattering length in a sweep of
the magnetic ﬁeld through a Feshbach resonance. The
two-body contact is an extensive thermodynamic magni-
tude proportional to the derivative of the internal en-
ergy of the ultracold gas with respect to the scatter-
ing length (Combescot et al., 2009; Schakel, 2010; Tan,
2008a,b,c; Werner et al., 2009), i.e, C2 ∝ dE/da. The
three-body contact C3 is deﬁned in terms of the deriva-
tive of the internal energy with respect to the three-body

21

parameter C3 ∝ dE/da− (Braaten et al., 2011; Castin
and Werner, 2011). 1

The measurements of the three-body recombination
rate were performed in dilute, ultracold, non-condensed
clouds containing 1.5 × 105 atoms of 85Rb at a tem-
perature T =80 nK. Then the magnetic ﬁeld was varied
through a Feshbach resonance in order to explore the re-
gion of negative scattering lengths. The obtained three-
body recombination rate was ﬁtted to the expected form
for the Eﬁmov three-body rate (Braaten and Hammer,
2006), obtaining a(1)

mer et al., 2006) and 7Li (Gross et al., 2009, 2010, 2011).

5. 133Cs

The ﬁrst experimental evidence of the Eﬁmov eﬀect
was observed in an ultracold gas of 133Cs (Kraemer et al.,
2006) by tuning the Cs-Cs scattering length of through a
Feshbach resonance, and measuring the enhancement and
decreases of the three-body loss coeﬃcient for negative
and positive scattering lengths, respectively. At the same
time, this pioneering work readily showed the possibility
of using ultracold physics in order to explore universal
physics in few-body physics.(Esry and Greene, 2006)

nances shown in Table III, the ratio of the three-body pa-
rameter a(1)
− to the van der Waals length (cid:96)vdW is approx-
imately equal for all the Feshbach resonances analyzed
in the experiment, to within only about %15 variations.
More recently, Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2014a) have
realized an exhaustive experimental work on the negative
scattering length branch of the two-body interaction in
Cs, conﬁrming the universality of the Eﬁmov scaling by
seeing for the ﬁrst time two successive Eﬁmov resonances
in a homonuclear system. Note, however, that more than
one previous experiment has observed the expected Eﬁ-
mov scaling between two successive destructive interfer-
ence St¨uckelberg minima a(n)
+ ; it should be remembered
that this behavior of three-body recombination at posi-
tive scattering lengths is a non-resonant manifestation of
universal Eﬁmov physics.

G. Four-body and ﬁve-body bound states and
recombination resonances

Normally one views 3-body recombination as a com-
paratively rare process in a dilute, ultracold gas. Typical
Bose-Einstein condensates, for instance, can have life-
times of the order of many seconds. Thus it may come
as a surprise that higher order processes involving even
more than 3 atoms simultaneously colliding in 3D can
have even higher inelastic collision rates in some regimes
of scattering length and density. There are theoretical
predictions of this resonant N -body recombination in
(Blume, 2012b; Blume and Yan, 2014; Mehta et al., 2009;
Rittenhouse et al., 2011a; von Stecher et al., 2009; Wang
and Esry, 2009; Wang et al., 2012c; Yan and Blume,
2015), and a few experimental observations (Dyke et al.,
2013; Ferlaino et al., 2009b; Pollack et al., 2009; Ulmanis
et al., 2016a; Zenesini et al., 2013). While these usually
cause diﬃculty for applications of interest with quantum
degenerate gases or optical lattices, they can be espe-
cially interesting and informative to study in their own
right, especially from a few-body point of view.

The 4-body problem has challenged theorists for many
years (Lazauskas and Carbonell, 2006) and is still of fun-
damental importance and interest. Extensive attention
has been devoted to the question of whether there is an
Eﬁmov eﬀect for four or more particles. For four or more
identical particles, an early theoretical study by (Amado
and Greenwood, 1973) concluded: “Hence the remark-
able Eﬁmov eﬀect seems even more remarkably to be a
property of the three-body system only.” Later, how-
ever, a treatment by (Kr¨oger and Perne, 1980) based on
a separable potential model concluded that in certain pa-
rameter ranges there is an Eﬁmov eﬀect for four bosons.
To add to this apparent discrepancy between the preced-
ing two references mentioned, the possible existence of an
Eﬁmov eﬀect in a 3D four-body system with three heavy

22

particles and one light particle was treated theoretically
by (Adhikari and Fonseca, 1981) and later by (Naus and
Tjon, 1987), reaching opposite conclusions (no and yes,
respectively). A subsequent study by (Adhikari et al.,
1995) suggests that an additional short-range length (or
high-momentum) scale is required for each successively
larger number N of particles, in order to pin down the
energy even of low-lying states. Another treatment by
(Yamashita et al., 2006) concluded that four-body bound
states can exist in the universal regime of large atom-
atom scattering lengths, but they will normally not be
ﬁxed in energy by 2-body and 3-body physics alone, and
will require an independent 4-body parameter. This con-
clusion was supported by a later study as well, namely
(Hadizadeh et al., 2011).

Based on 4-identical boson bound state calculations
using low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory, it was conjectured
by (Hammer and Platter, 2007; Platter et al., 2004) that
there should be two 4-boson bound states at unitarity
lying at energies between each successive pair of Eﬁmov
trimer energies. These studies suggested, in apparent
disagreement with (Yamashita et al., 2006), that the
energies are largely ﬁxed by the three-body parameter,
and at least to a good approximation, this would mean
that no additional 4-body parameter is needed. A 4-body
hyperspherical calculation was carried out (von Stecher
et al., 2009) that was based on the use of correlated Gaus-
sian basis functions(Suzuki and Varga, 1998) adapted
to the adiabatic hyperspherical representation(Daily and
Greene, 2014; Mitroy et al., 2013; Rakshit and Blume,
2012; von Stecher and Greene, 2009). Using that method,
(D’Incao et al., 2009; Mehta et al., 2009; von Stecher
et al., 2009; Wang and Esry, 2009) gave supporting evi-
dence to that conjecture, and advanced the theory to the
point where detailed predictions could be made of 4-body
recombination rate coeﬃcients and resonance positions.
In the universal
for instance, theory predicted
(von Stecher et al., 2009) that the two-body scattering
lengths where 4-boson resonances would be observable
as zero energy recombination resonances, should be at
the following values of the boson-boson scattering length:
4B,1 ≈ 0.43(1)
a−
− . These have since
been conﬁrmed in experimental studies (Ferlaino et al.,
2009a) of homonuclear recombination processes involving
four or more free bosonic atoms, although (von Stecher
et al., 2009) pointed out that there was already some ev-
idence for a four body process in (Kraemer et al., 2006).
Exciting theoretical progress in developing a highly quan-
titative theoretical treatment was subsequently reported
for four-body resonances and recombination by (Deltuva,
2010, 2011, 2012), in a momentum-space treatment based
on a separable two-body interaction, a treatment that
does not utilize hyperspherical coordinates. One inter-
esting aspect of those theoretical and experimental ef-
forts is the suggested implication that no additional 4-
body parameter is needed to ﬁx the universal behavior

4B,2 ≈ 0.9a(1)

− and at a−

limit,

of four interacting identical bosons, as it appears to be
ﬁxed once the 3-body parameter is known. The extent to
which this remains true for interactions of much shorter
range than van der Waals potentials remains an active
topic of investigation.

5B,1 ≈ (0.65 ± 0.01)a−

These developments in turn spawn a fundamental
question: Are the universal properties also ﬁxed for 5,
6, 7, and even more bosonic particles once the three-
body parameter is known?
If the answer is yes, this
is a crucial point that can greatly simplify the devel-
opment of realistic many-body theories for interacting
bosons. A number of studies (Blume and Greene, 2000;
Gattobigio et al., 2012; von Stecher, 2010, 2011; Ya-
mashita et al., 2010) bear directly on this question.
In particular, (von Stecher, 2011) predicts that a uni-
versal resonance of 5 identical bosons should occur at
zero energy when the two-body scattering length is equal
to a−
4B,1. That prediction was
tested and conﬁrmed experimentally by the Innsbruck
group(Zenesini et al., 2013); this study also compared a
detailed theoretical and experimental estimate of the di-
rect 5-body recombination rate, apparently the ﬁrst time
a direct (i.e. non-stepwise) recombination process could
be observed experimentally and computed theoretically.
While this is suggestive of a general universality for all
N-boson systems, very recent work by (Yan and Blume,
2015) suggests that this may apply only to systems whose
long-range two-body interaction is dominated by van der
Waals interactions, as shorter range interacting systems
apparently exhibit extensive variability in their N-boson
binding energies at unitarity.(Yamashita et al., 2010)

Following the prediction in (von Stecher, 2010, 2011),
the possible existence of a universal 5-body recombina-
tion resonance was tested and conﬁrmed in (Zenesini
et al., 2013). Fig.10 shows the comparison between the-
ory and experiment, in a region that includes both a
universal 4-body resonance and a universal 5-body res-
onance. These predictions of universal resonances ob-
servable in N -body recombination have been extended in
some impressive recent calculations to even larger num-
bers of identical bosons by (Gattobigio et al., 2011, 2012).

H. Eﬁmov states in heteronuclear mass-imbalanced systems

The existence of an inﬁnite series of three-body bound
states for resonant two-body interaction, as predicted by
Eﬁmov (Eﬁmov, 1970), is not only present for homonu-
clear systems, as such universal three-body bound states
should appear as well for heteronuclear systems (D’Incao
and Esry, 2006a,b; Eﬁmov, 1973a, 1979; Helfrich et al.,
2010; Mikkelsen et al., 2015; Petrov and Werner, 2015;
Wang et al., 2012d, 2015b). In particular, in heteronu-
clear systems the mass-imbalanced nature of the three-
body system preserves but modiﬁes in an interesting way
the discrete symmetry scaling characteristic of Eﬁmov

−

, and hence preserving the

universality of the three-body bound states. Most im-
portantly, it inﬂuences the scaling factor λ, which de-
pends on the masses of the three particles involved. In
particular, λ gets smaller as the mass imbalance of the
HHL system increases, which has sparked the study of
highly mass-imbalanced systems as the best possible sce-
nario for studying multiple excited Eﬁmov states, and
hence exploring as deeply and unambiguously as possi-
ble the universal characteristics of such states. To date,
heteronuclear Eﬁmov states have been searched for in
41K-87Rb-87Rb (Barontini et al., 2009; Wacker et al.,
2016), 39K-87Rb-87Rb (Wacker et al., 2016), 40K-87Rb-
87Rb (Bloom et al., 2013), 7Li-87Rb-87Rb (Maier et al.,
2015) and 6Li-133Cs-133Cs (Johansen et al., 2016; Tung
et al., 2014; Ulmanis et al., 2016a, 2015, 2016b).

The study of three-body losses in an ultracold mix-
ture 41K-87Rb performed by the LENS group led to
the ﬁrst claimed observation of heteronuclear Eﬁmov
speciﬁcally for 41K-87Rb-87Rb and 41K-41K-
states,
87Rb (Barontini et al., 2009). In particular, a three-body
parameter a(1)
− = -246 ± 14 a0 was claimed to be observed
for K-Rb-Rb. However, this claimed observation of an
Eﬁmov resonance has been questioned in the literature,
in part because it is so far from the expected theoreti-
cal range for this system. Owing to the positive value of
the Rb-Rb scattering length a ∼ 100 a0, the ﬁrst Eﬁmov
resonance is expected to occur in K-Rb-Rb at around
a(1)
− (K-Rb) ≤ -30,000 a0. In a very recent follow-up by
the Aarhus experimental group, they ﬁnd that there is
a two-body p-wave feature in the vicinity of the LENS
group’s claimed Eﬁmov resonance 41K-87Rb-87Rb, which
adds to doubts about the classiﬁcation of that loss feature
which doesn’t ﬁt universal expectations for the 3-body
system. (Ulmanis et al., 2016a; Wang et al., 2012d) Sim-
ilarly, the K-K-Rb system is “Eﬁmov-unfavored (LLH)”
since it has two lighter and one heavier atom, and its
ﬁrst Eﬁmov resonance has been predicted to occur only
for a(1)
− (K − Rb) ≤ −106 a.u. Other experiments on
potassium mixtures with 87Rb with either the fermionic
isotope 40K (Bloom et al., 2013) or the bosonic isotope
39K (Wacker et al., 2016) have failed to observe Eﬁmov
resonances at a reasonable value of the K−Rb scattering
length, results which are more consistent with theoreti-
cal expectations. In particular, the JILA group (Bloom
et al., 2013) studied an ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture
40K-87Rb, in which only 40K-87Rb-87Rb supports Eﬁmov
resonances because 40K-40K-87Rb is suppressed by spin
statistics. The JILA group measured the three-body re-
combination rate with the aim of testing whether they
could observe approximately the same Eﬁmov resonant
position as had been seen for 41K-87Rb-87Rb by (Baron-
tini et al., 2009). This expectation was of course fueled by
the assumption of universality of the three-body parame-
ter (Wang et al., 2012d). However, no trace of any Eﬁmov
resonances was observed at the expected two-body scat-

24

tering length (Bloom et al., 2013), consistent with our
current theoretical understanding (Ulmanis et al., 2016a;
Wang et al., 2012d).

Very recently an Eﬁmov resonance for 7Li-87Rb-87Rb
was reported, (Maier et al., 2015) as a consequence of a
ﬁrst exploration of the negative Li-Rb scattering length
in an ultracold mixture of bosonic Li and 87Rb. The
observed resonance is found at a(1)

rect heavy-heavy scattering length (Maier et al., 2015).

magnitude. Only one experiment to date, a heroic eﬀort
by the Innsbruck group in a homonuclear Cs gas (Huang
et al., 2014a), has been able to measure Eﬁmov physics
at a scattering length as large and negative as −22, 000
a0.

133Cs, with the Li-Cs scattering lengths denoted here as a(n)
− .
For the spin states utilized in these experiments, the back-
ground Cs-Cs scattering length in this region of magnetic ﬁeld
near 843G is approximately in the range −1600a0 < aCsCs <
−1000a0. The maxima of the three-body loss rate occur at the
indicated valuen a(n)
− , where n stand for the ordering of the
diﬀerent associated Eﬁmov states. The three-body parameter
is denoted here as a(1)
− . The discrete symmetry scaling factor
for two successive Eﬁmov states is denoted by λ. The Heidel-
berg group results of (Ulmanis et al., 2015) are shown in the
second and third columns, the results of Chicago group (Tung
et al., 2014) in the fourth and ﬁfth columns. Note that the
Heidelberg group also suggests a re-calibration of the Chicago
group’s data in Table 2 of (Ulmanis et al., 2015), but those
results are not shown here.

The most convincing tests of universal Eﬁmov scaling
are for the highly mass imbalanced case of 6Li-133Cs-
133Cs, studied independently by the Heidelberg (H¨afner
et al., 2017; Pires et al., 2014b; Ulmanis et al., 2016a,
2015, 2016b) and Chicago groups (Johansen et al., 2016;
Tung et al., 2014). Theoretically, the universal Eﬁmov
scaling factor for this system should be λ = 4.88 (D’Incao
and Esry, 2006a; Wang et al., 2012d), which enables
experiments to observe and characterize multiple reso-
nances in a single Eﬁmov series for the ﬁrst time. As
in many other approaches to Eﬁmov physics with ultra-
cold atoms, Chicago and Heidelberg groups use a mag-
netic Fano−Feshbach resonance for Li-Cs to vary the
two-body scattering length. The results for the observed
Eﬁmov resonances, characterized by analysis of the max-

ima in the three-body loss coeﬃcient, are shown in Ta-
ble IV, where the three-body parameter reported by the
Chicago and Heidelberg groups can be seen to agree ap-
proximately, to within the error bars. Another inter-
esting diﬀerence probed in the experiments by (Ulmanis
et al., 2016a) is the contrasting value of the ﬁrst Eﬁmov
resonance depending on the sign of the Cs-Cs scattering
length. For instance, when the Cs-Cs scattering length is
large and negative as in the cases reported in Table IV,
the ﬁrst resonance occurs at a Li-Cs scattering length
value equal to a(1)
− ≈ −320a.u.. But for a diﬀerent range
of magnetic ﬁelds where the Cs-Cs scattering length is
positive [a(Cs − Cs) ≈ 200a0], the ﬁrst resonance oc-
curs at a(1)
− ≈ −2000a.u. As is argued in (Ulmanis et al.,
2016a), this major diﬀerence can be understood qualita-
tively already in the zero-range theory, without invoking
van der Waals interactions, although a full model includ-
ing van der Waals ﬁnite-range interactions is needed to
make the description quantitatively accurate. These ex-
periments are of course extremely diﬃcult, and we stress
the importance of developing highly accurate two-body
scattering models before undertaking the analysis of de-
partures from expected universal behavior.

The prediction of Eﬁmov and the universality of the
three-body physics (Eﬁmov, 1970, 1971)is strictly true in
the case of two-body resonant interactions and assuming
T = 0, since no consideration was given to the kinetic
energy of the three-body system. A few studies have
carried out the appropriate Boltzmann average needed
to derive ﬁnite temperature predictions of the three-body
recombination rate, as in (Petrov and Werner, 2015; Rem
et al., 2013). Thus, in realistic systems one would expect
some deviations from Eﬁmov’s prediction. However, the
experimental observations seem to indicate that most of
the Eﬁmov states are accurately universal.

I. Eﬁmov and universal bound states for fermionic systems

It is well known that there is no Eﬁmov eﬀect for
homonuclear trimers composed of identical fermions in a
single intrinsic spin substate. This is easy to understand
because the requirement of antisymmetry adds nodes to
the spatial wavefunction and this raises the kinetic energy
of the trimer internal degrees of freedom substantially.
For a system of two heavy fermions of mass M in the
same spin state and a lighter distinguishable particle of
mass m, the nodal constraint of antisymmetry is weaker
and some interesting predictions for this case have been
presented by (Kartavtsev and Malykh, 2007, 2014). The
Eﬁmov eﬀect emerges for this FFX system with divergent
F+X scattering length, provided the mass ratio is suﬃ-
ciently large, namely M/m > 13.607. For smaller mass
ratios than this critical ratio just mentioned, one observes
one or two universal states, usually denoted “Kartavtsev-
Malykh universal trimers”, but there is no true Eﬁmov ef-

25

fect and the number of energy levels remains ﬁnite. Some
level perturbations that can aﬀect these universal trimer
states have been identiﬁed by (Safavi-Naini et al., 2013).

The possibility of a four-particle Eﬁmov eﬀect is an-
other intriguing prediction by (Castin et al., 2010), with
3 heavier identical fermions of mass M and one lighter
distinguishable particle of mass m. Speciﬁcally, they pre-
dict that only in the tiny mass ratio range 13.384 <
M/m < 13.607 should one be able to observe the inﬁnite
number of energy levels converging geometrically to zero
binding that characterizes Eﬁmov physics. A very recent
preprint from (Bazak and Petrov, 2016) predicts a pure
ﬁve-body Eﬁmov eﬀect, for a system of 4 heavy identical
fermions and 1 distinguishable particle, again in a small
range between 13.279 ± .002 < M/m < 13.384, based on
a stochastic solution of the generalized Skorniakov-Ter-
Martirosian (STM) equation (Pricoupenko, 2011), based
on techniques analogous to diﬀusion Monte Carlo meth-
(Bazak and Petrov, 2016) also pre-
ods. The study of
dicts mass ratios where one expects universal ﬁve-body
states in regimes where no true Eﬁmov eﬀect exists, and
a conjecture that the 5+1 hexamer and higher particle
numbers will be qualitatively diﬀerent rather than sim-
ply continuing the trend, a conjecture certainly deserving
to be explored. This study agrees and improves on the
accuracy of a prediction by (Blume, 2012b) that a uni-
versal 3+1 tetramer should exist at a mass ratio around
M/m ≥ 9.5, with the new and improved computed ratio
equal to M/m ≥ 8.862 ± 1.

J. Naturally occurring Eﬁmov physics in the helium trimer

The study of helium clusters– their aggregation, for-
mation and collision dynamics – has been an active re-
search topic in chemical physics, in particular in the ﬁeld
of molecular beams (Campargue, 2001). Molecular beam
experiments rely on the supersonic expansion of a chosen
gas in vacuum, which induces the cooling of the diﬀer-
ent molecular degrees of freedom as the gas expands in
the chamber. This cooling mechanism is due to inelastic
collisions involving electronic, rotational and vibrational
degrees of freedom, and hence it strongly depends on the
inelastic cross sections as well as the number of collisions
through the density of the gas (Montero and P´erez-R´ıos,
2014; Zhdanov, 2002; Zucrow and Hoﬀman, 1976). The
diluteness of the gas as it moves away from the nozzle can
be controlled by the initial conditions of the expansion:
temperature, pressure and mass ﬂow, through the con-
servation of enthalpy and mass ﬂow of the ﬂuid. There-
fore, any property or process related with the dynamics
of the gas, such as cluster formation, could be controlled
to some degree in those experiments. Using such meth-
ods, Sch¨ollokopf and Toennies (Sch¨ollkopf and Toennies,
1994, 1996) experimentally observed the helium dimer

and the ground state of helium trimer.

ical potential curves from the calculation of (Suno and Esry,

tions of the two helium trimer bound states, with a theory
comparison for the more diﬀuse state that is concluded to be
an Eﬁmov state. This measurement used laser ionization fol-
lowed by Coulomb explosion of the three resulting ions, with
detection in a COLTRIMS apparatus. For more details see
the combined theoretical and experimental paper published
by (Kunitski et al., 2015).

Although the ground state 4He3 was observed two
decades ago, the ﬁrst excited state of 4He3, which has Eﬁ-
mov character, was not observed until very recently (Ku-
nitski et al., 2015). Fig. 11 summarizes both the key the-
oretical and experimental results for the system. This
remarkably challenging experiment was performed by
joining the technology of molecular beam experiments,
atom interferometry, and modern ionization and detec-
tion techniques. In particular, a very well controlled noz-
zle conditions leaded to a supersonic expansion of He,
where He trimers were selected by means of matter-wave
diﬀraction through a grating. Then, all three atoms of
the trimer are ionized by means of a strong ultrashort
pulse, leading to the subsequent Coulomb explosion of
the trimer compounds. The momenta of the ions after the
Coulomb explosion were detected by cold target recoil ion

26

momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) (Jagutzki, 2002;
Ullrich, 2003), which allowed in an analysis the recon-
struction of the initial probability distribution of the
trimer atom positions, and thereby allowing a deduction
of the trimer binding energy.
In this way, Kunitski et
al. (Kunitski et al., 2015) studied the formation of two
diﬀerent He trimer states as functions of the pressure in
the nozzle, leading to the ﬁrst observation of the excited
state of 4He3.

The ﬁndings of Kunitski et al. (Kunitski et al., 2015)
revealed the geometry of the the ground state and ﬁrst
excited state of helium trimer.
In particular, for the
ground trimer state it was observed a unimodal radial
distribution for the atom-atom distance in the trimer, in
relation with the expected equilateral geometry. How-
ever, for the ﬁrst excited trimer state the radial distribu-
tion function shows a bimodal character, thus resembling
an isosceles triangular geometry. These results demon-
strate the Eﬁmov character of the ﬁrst excited state of

ergy is 2.60 ± 0.2 mK in very good agreement with some
of the most recent theoretical predictions (Hiyama and
Kamimura, 2012; Kunitski et al., 2015), however the bi-
modal radial distribution clearly deviates from what it is
expected from the universal Eﬁmov predictions for reso-
nant two-body interaction at unitarity, which is not sur-
prising in view of the ﬁnite value of the He-He scattering
length (Blume et al., 2000, 2014).

The most recent hyperspherical coordinate calcula-
tions of the helium trimer properties in the electronic
ground state appear to be those of (Suno and Esry, 2008).
Their J π = 0+ adiabatic potential energy curves ob-
tained with an up to date potential surface, which in-
cludes three-body as well as realistic retarded two-body
potential terms, are shown in Fig. 11. The energies drawn
into the lowest potential curve are the two computed
bound state energies, namely -130.86 mK and -2.5882
mK. The more weakly bound of these is the one expected
to have signiﬁcant Eﬁmov state character, and it is in fact
so weakly bound that its energy is indistinguishable from
E = 0 on the scale of Fig. 11.

IV. FEW-BODY PERSPECTIVES ON MANY-BODY
SYSTEMS

There are multiple ways in which few-body physics
is useful for understanding,
interpreting, and predict-
ing new many-body phenomena. The most obvious
is through the development of detailed theoretical un-
derstanding of the microscopic processes involving two,
three, four, or some cases even a handful more parti-
cles within a gas or lattice array of particles. The de-
tailed studies described above, and other review arti-
cles (Chin et al., 2010; K¨ohler et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
2013, 2015a) have focused largely on two-body phenom-

ena such as Fano-Feshbach resonances, and on the three-
body phenomena that arise such as Eﬁmov resonances
in three-body recombination and related behavior such
as St¨uckelberg interference minima. The initially sur-
prising experimental result (Cubizolles et al., 2003; Re-
gal et al., 2004a; Strecker et al., 2003) that huge univer-
sal fermionic dimers have remarkably small losses despite
their huge size was understood in an important theoret-
ical treatment by (Petrov et al., 2005a,b). This played
a key role in stimulating experiments in the BCS-BEC
crossover problem and in triggering explorations of other
phenomena in unitary Fermi gases. Fig. 12 shows a later
theoretical treatment of the two-component four-fermion
system in hyperspherical coordinates, including the com-
puted dimer-dimer scattering information. For instance,
it has now become possible to map out an extremely ac-
curate equation of state for unitary Fermi gases (Chevy
et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2012).

Another way few-body theories have provided some
useful perspectives on Bose-Einstein condensates and de-
generate Fermi gases has simply been through applying
the few-body toolkit and ideas - such as adiabatic hy-
perspherical potential curves - to the many-particle sys-
tem directly. In some cases this is done by treating only
a modest number of particles accurately, while in other
cases the many-particle limit is examined but at a rela-
tively crude level of approximation to estimate the many-
particle potential energy curves.

Few-body physics also produces insight into systems of
trapped atoms through the use of the idea of an artiﬁ-
cially strong trap. The premise here is that frequently
in a trapped quantum gas with thousands or even mil-
lions of atoms, the physical trap frequency might only
be of order 10 Hz and determines only a largely irrele-
vant energy scale for the system. More relevant by far
are the typical scale of interparticle interactions and the
average kinetic energy or temperature, reﬂected in the
separation of atoms ∆r. The physical content of this
separation length scale is sometimes referred to as the
“Fermi wavenumber” kF = 2π/∆r even when the gas
consists of some or even all bosonic particles. Then one
can gain insight by treating only 2, 3, or 4 particles in an
unphysical artiﬁcially tight “theoretical trap” designed to
have a high frequency with particle separation ∆r com-
parable to the ∆r in the actual many-particle system.
An example where this strategy enables a simple inter-
pretation (Borca et al., 2003). of a complicated many-
body problem is the famous “atom-molecule” coherent
oscillations or quantum beats observed in an 85Rb ex-
periment(Donley et al., 2002), depicted in Fig. 13.

as a polar crystal or helium liquid, it attracts other par-

old energy E = 0 for complete four-body dissociation. Using
these adiabatic potential energy curves and the nonadiabatic
couplings, the elastic and inelastic collision properties could
be computed for this system. (b) Computed elastic ar

smallness of the inelastic (imaginary) scattering length, ﬁrst
understood theoretically by (Petrov et al., 2005a,b), which
was crucial for understanding why the two-component Fermi
gas has minimal losses close to unitarity(Cubizolles et al.,
2003; Regal et al., 2004a; Strecker et al., 2003). These low
losses were crucial in enabling the BCS-BEC crossover exper-
iments to be successful and create long-lived quantum gases.

ticles from the bulk and the entity behaves as a quasi-
particle, as described in highly-cited early studies by
(Feynman, 1955; Fr¨ohlich, 1954). Such a quasi-particle
was denoted a polaron, and this term has been gener-
alized to describe a more general situation in which an
interaction-dressed minority particle moves in the ﬁeld of
other particles in a medium. An active ﬁeld of research
to this day, polarons have attracted extensive attention
from experimental (Michaud and Sanche, 1987) as well

rotzek et al., 2009; Spethmann et al., 2012; Tempere
et al., 2009) and very recently, as in (Hu et al., 2016;
Jørgensen et al., 2016). Some work has considered an
impurity with internal degrees of freedom called an “an-
gulon” which is a quasi-particle consisting of a rotating
impurity dressed by the quantal many-body environment
(Lemeshko, 2017; Schmidt and Lemeshko, 2016). To date
the explorations have concentrated on the behavior of a
single impurity in a BEC or DFG, but a future few-body
topic that is still in its infancy will be the study of in-
teractions among two or more impurities dressed by the
many-body environment. An initial foray along those
lines by (Naidon, 2016) treats two-body polaron-polaron
interactions. We refer the reader to the excellent recent
review of this subject in (Naidon and Endo, 2016) and
references therein.

B. Bose-Einstein condensates viewed in hyperspherical
coordinates

In the Russian nuclear physics literature, a technique
evolved during the 1960s and 1970s to treat the many-
nucleon problem, which was referred to as “K-harmonic”
theory. This treatment was based on a particularly sim-
ple approximation formulated in hyperspherical coordi-
nates. The basic idea was to ﬁnd the lowest grand an-
gular momentum state, the “K-harmonic” |KQ >. This
eigenfunction of hyperangular kinetic energy and various
symmetry operators is usually an appropriately antisym-
metrized linear combination of hyperspherical harmon-
ics; they are constrained to obey the symmetries of the
system such as the Pauli exclusion principle, deﬁnite par-
ity, and so on. This approximation then uses this single
harmonic to describe the hyperangular wavefunction of
the system. When this technique is applied to the de-
scription of a single component BEC, it is particularly
simple because the K-harmonic for this system is simply
the state of vanishing grand angular momentum, K = 0,
which is a constant in the hyperangular space of any N -
particle system. While the resulting wavefunction is not
suﬃciently realistic to describe the true short-range inter-
actions that occur whenever any two particles approach
each other, the use of the Fermi pseudopotential in the
many-body Hamiltonian implies that the average energy
of interaction can be approximately represented pertur-
batively.(Bohn et al., 1998) In our terminology today, we
can view this as approximating the lowest adiabatic hy-
perangular eigenfunction as this K-harmonic, after which
perturbation theory can be applied to the interparticle in-
teraction term in the Hamiltonian to determine the ap-
proximate ground state potential energy curve for the

Figure 13 (a) Two-body s-wave energy levels in 85Rb are
shown as a function of magnetic ﬁeld near the 155 G Fano-
Feshbach resonance that was used by (Donley et al., 2002)
to study quantum beats between atomic states of a quantum
degenerate Rb gas and molecular states. (b) Calculated quan-
tum beats reﬂecting interference between one pathway where
a given pair of atoms remained atomic and another pathway
where that pair of atoms was bound into a long-range univer-
sal dimer for a delay time T . These two-body calculations use
an artiﬁcially tight trap (ω(cid:48) = 2π kHz whose peak density ap-
proximately equals the density of 17,100 atoms trapped in the
actual experiment whose geometric mean trapping frequency
was ω = 2π × 12 Hz. Taken from (Borca et al., 2003)

as theoretical studies (Basak and Cohen, 1979; Fano and
Stephens, 1986; Stephens and Fano, 1988) in condensed-
matter physics. In recent years polaron physics has be-
come a topic of great interest in the ultracold atomic
physics community, owing to the promise of great control
and observability. The few-body side of polaron physics
has two major areas of interest. One aspect is to discern
the details of a single quasi-particle in the many-body en-
vironment and the more advanced topic of interactions
among 2, 3, or 4 quasi-particles, i.e. the eﬀect of a many-
body bosonic or fermionic bath of particles on the inter-
actions, energy levels, and recombination of the quasi-
particles. (Bellotti et al., 2016) The second area that has
received extensive attention is the behavior of few-body
analogues of a polaronic system, with small numbers of
minority and majority particles, such as the HHL and
HHHL and related problems discussed elsewhere in this
review.

Polarons have received attention in ultracold atom ex-
periments and theory over the past decade or so by (As-
trakharchik and Pitaevskii, 2004; Bei-Bing and Shao-
Long, 2009; Bruderer et al., 2008; Catani et al., 2012;

many particle system, namely, U0(R). See Fig. 14. This
treatment does a reasonable job of predicting the ap-
proximate maximum number of atoms that can exist in
a harmonic trap when the scattering length is negative,
beyond which the system undergoes a macroscopic col-
lapse often referred to as the “Bosenova” (Bradley et al.,
1997; Donley et al., 2001).

tractive (a < 0 BEC) in the hyperspherical adiabatic theory,
compared with the random phase approximation which is es-
sentially identical to Bogoliubov theory. Taken from (Bohn
et al., 1998).

Since that simple study of (Bohn et al., 1998), other
studies have considered improvements of the hyperspher-
ical BEC treatment, including generalizations to asym-
metrical traps and attempts to better include the two-
body correlation physics beyond the simplest mean-ﬁeld
approximations.(Kim and Zubarev, 2002; Kushibe et al.,
2004; Sorensen et al., 2004; Watson and McKinney, 1999)

C. The unitary Bose gas

Based on what has been learned from studies of di-
lute Bose gas recombination theory and experiments, one
expects it to be impossible to create a long-lived Bose-
Einstein condensate in the unitary limit where a → ∞.
This conclusion is based on the fact that three-body

29

losses are seen to scale with the scattering length over-
all as a4, aside from quantum resonance and interference
factors. Nevertheless this is a fascinating limit, in part
because it can test whether the recombination loss rates
continue to scale as a4 all the way to a → ∞ and in part
because the many-body behavior implied by the Gross-
Pitaevskii equation looks so qualitatively diﬀerent for
large negative (inﬁnitely attractive and immediate col-
lapse) versus large positive scattering lengths (inﬁnitely
strong repulsion).

These questions have long been of theoretical interest,
e.g. (Cowell et al., 2002; Lee and Lee, 2010; Radzihovsky
et al., 2008), and recently they have begun to receive ex-
perimental attention. One way to deal with the transient
nature of any short-lived quantum gas is to perform the
experiment as a “quench”, i.e. begin with a BEC at small
positive scattering length and then suddenly ramp to the
range of unitarity, a → ∞. A recent experiment at JILA
by (Makotyn et al., 2014) very quickly stimulated exten-
sive theoretical work (Ancilotto et al., 2015; Corson and
Bohn, 2016; Hudson et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2014, 2016;
Kira, 2015; Laurent et al., 2014; Piatecki and Krauth,
2014; Rancon and Levin, 2014; Sykes et al., 2014; Yin
and Radzihovsky, 2016) to understand their main obser-
vations, which were the following. (i) The a4 scaling of
three-body loss is no longer applicable at very large scat-
tering lengths, i.e. when na3 >> 1 where n is the density.
To understand this, Ref.(Makotyn et al., 2014) deﬁnes a
characteristic wavenumber of the system (analogous to
the Fermi wavenumber) as K ≡ (6π2n)1/3, which is com-
parable to the inverse of the average interparticle spacing.
The authors propose that in any formula involving the
scattering length a, it should be viewed as saturating at
a constant value of the order of 1/K as soon as you reach
the regime Ka ≈ 1. In other words, as soon as a → ∞,
it is no longer a relevant length scale in the system, and
the premise is that the interparticle spacing becomes the
largest relevant scale instead. (ii) The momentum dis-
tribution of the atom cloud was measured as a function
of time after the jump to unitarity, and it settled down
to a quasi-stable distribution, which was the target of
various many-body and few-body theory eﬀorts to try to
understand.

One of the main items of interest in this system, from
a few-body physics perspective, is the saturation of losses
at a value far smaller than would be expected from the
zero-temperature a4 scaling. An estimate(Sykes et al.,
2014) has been made of the three-body rate coeﬃcient
L3 ≈ 3 × 10−23 cm6/sec is reasonably close (around half
as large as) the measured value in the JILA experiment
of (Makotyn et al., 2014). This theoretical estimate is
made using the few-body “artiﬁcial trap model” which
considers only 3 atoms but places them in an artiﬁcially
tight trap such that the atom density approximately
matches the experimental average density, which was
(cid:104)n(cid:105) = 5.5(3) × 1012 cm−3. As is discussed in greater de-

tail in (Sykes et al., 2014), one obtains somewhat poorer
quantitative agreement but still the correct order of mag-
nitude for the loss rate at unitarity by replacing the value
of a in the universal 3-body loss rate formulas by 1/K
as deﬁned above in terms of the average density in the
gas. Other experimental studies of the unitary Bose gas
that have focused on the three-body loss rate include
(Eismann et al., 2016; Fletcher et al., 2013; Rem et al.,
2013). And another intriguing “universality limit” where
the scattering length is no longer a relevant length scale
is the opposite limit a ≈ 0, recently explored experimen-
tally with some phenomenological conjectures in (Shotan
et al., 2014).

D. Two-component Fermi gases and the BCS-BEC
crossover problem

One fascinating type of dilute quantum gas experiment
consists of distinguishable fermions, either in two or more
spin substates or else composed of two or more types of
distinguishable particles. This system received extensive
attention from many theory (e.g. (Hu et al., 2007, 2006;
Hui et al., 2004; Yan and Blume, 2016; Yin and Blume,
2015)) and experimental groups,(DeMarco and Jin, 1999;
Houbiers et al., 1997; Ketterle and Zwierlein, 2008; Ku
et al., 2012; Schunck et al., 2005; Zwierlein et al., 2006,
2004) with particularly keen interest in the community
around a decade ago. Conceptually, one typically starts
the experiment by forming a two-component degenerate
Fermi gas without interactions, i.e. with vanishing scat-
tering length between the two component atoms. Inter-
actions between like fermions can usually be ignored, un-
less one is close to a p − wave Fano-Feshbach resonance.
Now one increases the attraction by making the scatter-
ing length a between unlike atoms small and negative,
i.e. −1 << kf a < 0. This is the regime usually referred
to as the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) region, be-
cause the weak attraction tends to cause pairing. These
BCS-type pairs are sometimes referred to as “pre-formed
pairs” because the pairing occurs before the attraction is
strong enough to form true isolated dimer bound states.
Of course true molecular bound states can be formed only
after the attraction has increased beyond kf a < −1, to
inﬁnite a and then a is large and positive which allows
1
2µa2 .
true universal dimers to form with binding energy
At that point, when the gas has large and positive a, the
quantum gas has experienced a “crossover” from a degen-
erate Fermi gas to a BEC of weakly-bound molecules (S´a
de Melo et al., 1993). Remarkably, such a system allows
an exploration of either Fermi or Bose quantum statis-
tics depending on the range of scattering lengths chosen
experimentally. An impressive series of experiments has
observed precisely these phenomena (Greiner et al., 2003;
Loftus et al., 2002; Regal et al., 2005, 2004b), and this
crossover physics has been reviewed by (Regal and Jin,

30

2007).

Of course the single-component Fermi gas is also of in-
terest, with all fermionic atoms in the same intrinsic spin
state. Owing to the absence of s-wave collisions in such
systems, the cross sections for two-body elastic collisions
that are needed for thermalization of the gas are generally
quite small at ultracold temperatures. Use of a p-wave
Fano-Feshbach resonance can enhance the cross sections,
although two-body losses also usually grow in the vicinity
of such resonances (Regal et al., 2003). A two-component
Fermi gas has its three-body recombination losses sup-
pressed since the low temperature behavior of the rate
coeﬃcient is linear in the temperature T , in contrast to
a gas of bosons or of 3 distinguishable particles which
have a constant low-temperature 3-body recombination
rate. A spin-polarized gas of fermions, on the other hand,
has an even stronger suppression of the low-temperature
recombination rate, which varies as T 2. This might be
expected to give very long-lived Fermi gases when fully
polarized, but near a p-wave Fano-Feshbach resonance in
spin-polarized 40K (the point where the p-wave scatter-
ing volume Vp → ∞), the recombination coeﬃcient has
been measured (Regal et al., 2003) and calculated (Suno
et al., 2003a,b), and found to approach within an appre-
ciable fraction of the unitarity limit for the atom loss rate
at total relative energy E:

In addition to an explosion of eﬀort to understand the
many-body physics of the BCS-BEC crossover problem,
there has also been extensive fruitful eﬀort directed to-
wards understanding this system from a few-body point
of view. See in particular (Akkineni et al., 2007; Alhas-
sid et al., 2008; Bulgac et al., 2006; Chang and Bertsch,
2007; Kestner and Duan, 2007; Werner and Castin, 2006;
Zinner et al., 2009). And in fact one limit of the many-
body problem, the “high energy limit” can be accurately
treated using the virial or cluster expansion. Exciting
progress in computing virial coeﬃcients for three parti-
cles
(Castin and Werner, 2013; Liu et al., 2009) and
for four particles (Yan and Blume, 2016) has been con-
tributed in landmark theoretical papers during the past
decade, as well as tested in a few impressive experi-
ments. (Nascimbene et al., 2010)

E. A step beyond independent particles: the Tan Contact

The standard methods used in most many-body cal-
culations usually start with a mean-ﬁeld wavefunction
ansatz, in some cases going one step farther to the level
of Bogoliubov theory or, what is essentially equivalent,
the random phase approximation (Esry, 1997; Fetter and
Walecka, 2003). These approximations have a demon-

strated track record of describing gross global proper-
ties of many body systems, for properties such as chem-
ical potentials, total energies, and excitation frequen-
cies (Dalfovo et al., 1999; Giorgini et al., 2008). One
thing that should be kept in mind about such treat-
ments is that they are based on ridiculously inaccurate
cartoon-level wavefunctions of the many-body system
at interparticle distances less than the van der Waals
length. However, the behavior over larger distances of
order of the long de Broglie wavelengths in the system,
it turns out to be reasonable. To understand the ﬂaws in
the full many-body wavefunction ansatz used to derive
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the workhorse equation
of Bose-Einstein condensation theory, recall that it is a
product of independent orbitals ψ, i.e. Ψ(−→r1 , −→r2 , ....−→rN ) =
ψ(−→r1 )ψ(−→r2 )...ψ(−→rN ). Why is this a patently absurd hy-
pothesis? Because it says that each particle’s probabil-
ity amplitude is independent of the instantaneous posi-
tions of all other particles; but in reality, there simply
must be, in the “true” wavefunction of the system, a
two-body character (at the very least) when the distance
between any two particles of the gas gets comparable to
the interaction length scale in the potential energy func-
tion between those particles (the van der Waals length
in the case of isotropic atoms). For two 87Rb atoms in
spin-stretched magnetic substates, for instance, the zero-
energy wavefunction of any two approaching atoms in
the Rb BEC must have the 39 nodes as the interparti-
cle distance is varied which are guaranteed to be there
by Levinson’s theorem,(Rodberg and Thaler, 1970; Tay-
lor, 1972) since the Rb dimer has 39 triplet bound states
(For an ultracold
in the L = 0 orbital partial wave.
atomic gas, higher partial wave physics is normally sup-
pressed by the centrifugal barrier, so we will focus only
on the s-wave physics in this discussion.) This behav-
ior is often incorporated into Monte Carlo(MC) calcu-
lations by using a “Jastrow-type” variational trial func-
tion (or a guiding function in the case of diﬀusion MC),
which includes a product of all zero energy two-body pair
wavefunctions (Carlson et al., 2015; Dalfovo et al., 1999;
Giorgini et al., 2008).

To see why the cartoon-level approximation gives such
a good description of many properties, consider the zero-
range Fermi pseudopotential representation of the inter-
action between two low energy particles, i.e. V (−→rij) =
δ(−→r ij), where aij is the scattering length between
2πaij (cid:126)2
µij
particles i and j and µij is their reduced mass. In the
important paper by(Fermi, 1934), he proved that this po-
tential gives an accurate interaction energy of two parti-
cles with ﬁnite range potentials in the zero energy limit,
even when highly inaccurate zeroth-order wavefunctions
are utilized; this rescues many-body predictions of ener-
gies and other gross properties of the many-body system.
The success of this “rescue” is documented by (Holzmann
and Castin, 1999) who demonstrate that the behaviors

31

over large distance scales of mean ﬁeld and Bogoliubov
wavefunctions are quite reasonable, even though their
Hamiltonian does not contain the large number of two-
body bound states whose presence would cause rapid,
short-range oscillations in any “exact” wavefunction of
all alkali metal atoms in a many-body gas.

Nevertheless, some properties of the many-body sys-
tem go beyond those global properties that are well
described by a separable wavefunction ansatz and its
crude improvements at the next level of approximation.
One such property identiﬁed by Shina Tan in a ground-
breaking series of papers (Tan, 2008a,b,c) is the “high
energy” limit of the pair correlation function. This Tan
contact parameter has now been measured for a Fermi
gas (Sagi et al., 2013, 2012) as well as for a BEC(Wild
et al., 2012), and those experiments have conﬁrmed the
basis two-body physics on which Tan’s ideas are based.
In brief, one way of looking at the Tan contact is to
acknowledge that there will be a range of distances, as
two zero-energy particles begin to approach each other at
smaller and smaller distances rij, where the wavefunction
must be proportional to:

Ψ ∝

1
aij

−

1
rij

(60)

In a sense the physics of the Tan contact is just the
tip of the iceberg, because at higher momenta one be-
gins to probe the full momentum space wavefunction of
two-body subsystems, which have a complicated struc-
ture that in general depends on the detailed nature of
their short range interactions. For instance, in a gas
of Rb or K atoms, one can expect that the momentum
space wavefunction above kvdW ∼ 1/(cid:96)vdW or at ener-
gies above a few MHz should exhibit deviations from
the contact prediction based on the scattering length
alone. Experimental measurements to date appear to
be mostly in the 10-100 kHz regime. Nevertheless, there
a wide energy range, high compared to many body ex-
citation frequencies but low compared to van der Waals
energy scales, where Tan’s contact and scattering length
two-body physics controls the major departure of the
atomic quantum gas from a description in terms of non-
interacting independent particle wavefunctions (Blume
and Daily, 2009; Braaten et al., 2010; Braaten and Plat-
ter, 2009; Corson and Bohn, 2016; Hudson et al., 2014;
Sykes et al., 2014; Yan and Blume, 2013; Yin and Radz-
ihovsky, 2016; Yin and Blume, 2015).

F. Towards many-body theory with realistic interactions

If a mean ﬁeld separable wavefunction ansatz is at-
tempted in a variational calculation that uses realistic
atom-atom interactions, the results are disastrous and
the total energy is overestimated by many orders of mag-
nitude (Esry and Greene, 1999). Basically, the mean-

ﬁeld wavefunction is unable to make the wavefunction
negligibly small at small distances where the atom-atom
potential is hugely repulsive. An exact solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation would of course make the wavefunc-
tions exponentially small in such classically forbidden
regions, something that no independent particle wave-
function is “smart enough” to accomplish. Quantum
Monte Carlo calculations, however, are able to solve for
ground states of many particle systems and they are
smart enough to make the wavefunctions exponentially
small in regions of strong repulsion. For instance, some of
the best calculations of helium cluster energies have been
obtained using diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations (Blume
and Greene, 2002; Lewerenz, 1997). Obtaining excited
state information from Monte Carlo calculations is no-
toriously diﬃcult and limited, however, which makes the
technique diﬃcult to use for determining scattering prop-
erties.

One hybrid theory that has shown promise combines
Monte Carlo and adiabatic hyperspherical ideas (Blume
and Greene, 2000). The basic idea is to carry out a
diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculation to ﬁnd the energy of
the system at a ﬁxed hyperradius. By repeating the
calculation for many diﬀerent hyperradii, one maps out
the ground state potential energy curve of the system.
Then, within the adiabatic approximation that neglects
coupling to higher potential curves, at least elastic scat-
tering and a class of excited bound state properties can
be computed. That approach has been used to compute
hyperspherical potential curves (including diagonal adia-
batic correction terms) for clusters of up to N = 10 4He
atoms, as is shown in Fig. 15, and observable proper-
ties such as binding energies and atom-cluster scattering
lengths. There appear to be no competing calculations to
date of the atom-cluster scattering lengths, for instance,
beyond about N = 6 helium atoms, although excellent
progress has been achieved up to N = 6, and in some
cases beyond, by using Gaussian wavefunctions in com-
bination with a Hamiltonian based on soft-core model
potentials.

V. ULTRACOLD ATOMS IN LOW DIMENSIONAL
TRAPS

The experimental realization of Bose-Einstein conden-
sation in a dilute gas of alkali-atoms in 1995 (Anderson
et al., 1995; Bradley et al., 1995; Davis et al., 1995) en-
ables the investigation of pure quantum systems that lie
at the interface among atomic, molecular, quantum opti-
cal physics and many-body physics. A key breakthrough
emerging from the control of ultracold gaseous matter is
the capability to tune interatomic interactions in strength
and sign by means of magnetic or optical Fano-Feshbach
resonances (Chin et al., 2010; Inouye et al., 1998; K¨ohler
et al., 2006). Nowadays, this has triggered the next gen-

32

curves for N 4He atoms with N = 3 − 10. These poten-
tial curves are for total angular momentum L = 0. They
were computed in a hybrid hyperspherical-diﬀusion Monte
Carlo method. Based on these potentials, approximate scat-
tering lengths were computed, for instance a(He9+He)=67 a0.
Note that the potential curve for HeN converges asymptoti-
cally to the ground state energy of the HeN −1 cluster. Taken

eration of quantum technologies that allow experimental
creation and manipulation of low-dimensional ultracold
gases (Bloch et al., 2008; Bongs and Sengstock, 2004;
Cazalilla et al., 2011; Giamarchi, 2004; Imambekov et al.,
2012; Kolomeisky and Straley, 1996; Lewenstein et al.,
2012, 2007; Lieb et al., 2004; McKay and DeMarco, 2011)
of bosonic or fermionic or mixed symmetry (Giorgini
et al., 2008).

Degenerate ultracold atomic gases of reduced dimen-
sionality then serve as a vehicle for experimental real-
izations and theoretical investigations of exotic quan-
tum phases such as the Tonks-Girardeau gas (TG) (Gi-
rardeau, 1960; Tonks, 1936). The TG many-body phase
consists of a one-dimensional gas of impenetrable bosons
with inﬁnite pairwise repulsion. A fundamental prop-
erty of the TG gas is that it can be viewed as dis-
playing a fermionization of the bosons. In this context,
fermionization indicates that the inﬁnite repulsion of the
bosons creates a node when any two particles touch, so
that the squared wavefunction of the inﬁnitely repelling
bosons coincides with that of a noninteracting fermionic
gas. When the repulsive 1D interaction coeﬃcient is
cranked up beyond the pole and onto the side repre-
senting inﬁnite attraction, the bosonic ensemble experi-
ences a metastable many-body state, namely the “super
Tonks-Girardeau” gas phase (Astrakharchik et al., 2005).
Clearly the strength and the sign of interactions play an
essential role in creating and probing these exotic many-
body phases.
It is therefore crucial to study in detail
the collisional processes as modiﬁed by external conﬁning
Indeed, in these particular low-dimensional
potentials.

two-body systems, the conﬁnement generates signiﬁcant
modiﬁcations to the colliding pair scattering properties.
Existing theoretical studies on bosonic collisions show
that resonant scattering can be induced by the conﬁne-
ment, yielding the so-called conﬁnement-induced reso-
nance (CIR) eﬀect (Dunjko et al., 2011a; Yurovsky et al.,
2008). A CIR occurs when the length scale of the con-
ﬁnement becomes comparable to the s-wave scattering
length of the colliding bosons and it produces a diver-
gence in the 1D coupling coeﬃcient that is interpreted as
a Fano-Feshbach-like resonance. The additional control
of low dimensional gaseous matter by varying the conﬁne-
ment frequency led to the experimental creation of the
TG gas (Kinoshita et al., 2004; Paredes et al., 2004) and
the Super-TG gas (Haller et al., 2009) in cigar-shaped
traps.

Evidently, the deepening understanding of collision
physics in the low-dimensional ultracold gases translates
into an ability to manipulate and even to design new
many-body phases by means of the external conﬁnement.

A. Conﬁnement-induced resonances: an interlude

Early seminal work by (Demkov and Drukarev, 1966)
treated the motion of an electron in the presence of a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld as well as a zero-range poten-
tial. That study showed that the motion of the charged
particle is bounded in the presence of the magnetic and
zero-range potentials whereas in the magnetic free case
the zero-range potential can not bind the electron. An-
other physical system which exhibits similar eﬀects is
the negative-ion photodetachment in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld (Blumberg et al., 1979; Clark, 1983; Crawford, 1988;
Greene, 1987; Grozdanov, 1995; Larson and Stoneman,
1985; Robicheaux et al., 2015) where in this particu-
lar case the electron-atom interaction is treated as a
short-range potential. Note that all these cases are half-
collisions, in the sense that they arise in photofragmen-
tation processes, and only involve an escape to inﬁnity,
whereas a full collision involves both an incoming wave
and an outgoing wave.

In the realm of ultracold atomic physics, (Olshanii,
1998) showed in his seminal work that boson-boson col-
lisions in an axially symmetric waveguide relies on vir-
tually identical mathematics as the system treated by
Demkov and Drukarev, except with the trapping poten-
tial playing the role of the transverse diamagnetic con-
ﬁnement caused by the magnetic ﬁeld. More speciﬁcally,
Olshanii showed that the conﬁnement not only can create
a new bound state, but it can also nontrivially enhance
the resonant two-body collision amplitude. In many cases
the reduced-dimensional bound state is not strictly new,
but can be viewed as having been shifted from its posi-
tion in the 3D or 2D system. For this reason, the term
“conﬁnement-induced resonance” is often used synony-

33

mously with the term “conﬁnement-shifted resonance”.
The following brieﬂy summarizes the two-body scattering
and its modiﬁcation under the inﬂuence of the trapping
potential and highlights the physical implications.

1. Two-body collisions in a cigar-shaped trap

Two bosonic particles in the presence of a quasi-1D
waveguide have s-wave collisions that can be modeled
using a Fermi-Huang regularized pseudopotential. The
waveguide constrains the motion of the particles trans-
versely, they propagate freely in the longitudinal direc-
tion. The quadratic nature of the trapping potential al-
lows separation of the Schr¨odinger equation into center-
of-mass and relative degrees of freedom. The relative
coordinate Hamiltonian describes the relevant collisional
physics, which in cylindrical coordinates reads

H = −

µω2

⊥ρ2,

(61)

where µ is the reduced mass of the two bosons, ω⊥ is
the frequency of the conﬁning potential. As usual, ρ
denotes the radial polar coordinate and Vsh is the 3D
Fermi-Huang pseudopotential operator, deﬁned by:

Vsh(r)Ψ =

2π(cid:126)2as(E)
µ

δ(r)

d
dr

(rΨ),

(62)

where as indicates the s-wave scattering length, δ(r) de-
notes the three dimensional delta function and the quan-
tity d
dr (r· ) is the regularization operator. Note that the
s-wave scattering length in Eq. 62 depends on the relative
collision energy E in the pseudopotential, although in the
ultracold limit this energy dependence is often negligible.
The waveguide symmetry implies that the transverse
degrees of freedom in the scattering solutions can be ex-
panded in terms of two-dimensional harmonic oscillator
eigenstates in the potential 1
⊥ρ2 and the transverse
part of the Laplacian in the Hamiltonian H (see Eq. 61).
The corresponding transverse eigenenergies are given by
Enm = (cid:126)ω⊥(n + |m| + 1), with n = 2nρ = 0, 2, 4, ... be-
ing the quantum number associated with the nodes of the
wave function in the ρ-direction and m the azimuthal an-
gular momentum. This relative Hamiltonian H possesses
azimuthal symmetry, so m is a good quantum through-
out all the conﬁguration space. Here we concentrate on
the case m = 0.

2 µω2

Remarkably, the prescription given in (Demkov and
Drukarev, 1966) to regularize a divergent sum that arises
in the derivation involves a very similar mathematical
analysis as was used in the CIR treatment of (Olshanii,
1998) that results in a Hurwitz zeta function that is well-
deﬁned.

This means that the system interacts strongly at a ﬁ-
nite value of the 3D scattering length, whereas in the

absence of the conﬁnement the two bosons exhibit a
comparatively weak interaction. This particular phe-
nomenon is the so-called conﬁnement-induced resonance
(CIR). The main feature of this eﬀect is that the corre-
sponding resonance condition, as(E)/a⊥ = −1/c1, can
be met either by tuning the trapping frequency or by
adjusting the scattering length via a Fano-Feshbach res-
onance, where a⊥ = (cid:112)µω⊥/(cid:126).

due to the trap. More speciﬁcally, as the ratio as(E)/a⊥
tends to −1/c1 the quantity g1D → ∞. This particular
feature is depicted in Fig.16 by the vertical dotted line
where the position of the CIR is indicated by the red star.
In Fig. 16 the coupling constant g1D is shown as a func-
tion of the ratio as(E)/a⊥. The black dots correspond
to the full numerical solution of the Hamiltonian given
in Eq. (61) where the two body interactions are mod-
eled by a 6-10 potential, i.e. V (r) = C10/r10 − C6/r6.
The orange solid line denotes the analytical result of the
coupling constant g1D given in Eq. (63) which agrees
accurately with the numerical solution. Furthermore,
Fig. 16 shows that as the ratio as(E)/a⊥ tends to in-
ﬁnity the coupling constant tends asymptotically to a
weakly attractive limit in the eﬀective 1D potential en-
ergy. The resonant 3D free-space two body interactions,
on either the repulsive or attractive side, are modiﬁed
into weakly attractive 1D forces due to the trapping ge-
ometry. This attractive force in the waveguide is de-
termined solely by the c1(k) constant and the oscilla-
tor length a⊥. Indeed, for as(E)/a⊥ → ∞ the coupling
strength is g1D → (cid:126)2

expression given in Eq. (63). The black dots correspond to
full numerical calculations where the two-body interactions
are modeled via a 6-10 potential. The red star denotes the
position of the conﬁnement-induced resonance.

The treatment by (Olshanii, 1998) showed that the full
Hamiltonian in Eq. (61) can be mapped onto an eﬀective
one-dimensional Hamiltonian with a delta function inter-
action between the two bosons, of strength g1D.

This eﬀective two-body interaction derived from ﬁrst
principles can be utilized directly in a many-body Hamil-
tonian, which permits an exploration of the underlying
physics associated with the Tonks-Girardeau gas. The ef-
fective Hamiltonian based on the coupling strength g1D
encapsulates all the relevant scattering information in the
full Hamiltonian as well as the non-trivial modiﬁcations

of conﬁnement-induced resonances. Bound state energies in
units of (cid:126)ω⊥, i.e.E/(cid:126)ω⊥ are depicted versus the ratio a⊥/as.
The red dotted lines indicate the energy levels of the unper-
turbed two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which act here
as channel threshold energies. The black star denotes the po-
sition of the conﬁnement-induced resonance relevant in the
ultracold limit. The black dashed curve illustrates the s-wave
bound state in the absence of the trapping potential. The
solid orange curve corresponds to the molecular conﬁnement-
induced resonance. The blue curve is the CIR bound state
energy supported by all the closed channels.

Qualitatively, the CIR can be viewed as a bound state
supported by all the closed channels whose energy co-
incides with the lowest channel threshold, as in a usual
Fano-Feshbach resonance (Bergeman et al., 2003). This
multichannel bound state produces only a single pole in
the reactance operator, i.e. the tangent of the 1D even z-
parity phase shift. To follow up on this idea, one can ob-
tain the binding energies of the closed channel supported

bound molecule (black dashed line) coincides with the
energy of the conﬁnement-induced molecular state (or-
ange solid line). This occurs at these values of scattering
length since the two-body potential is deep enough forc-
ing the wavefunction to vanish before the trapping po-
tential becomes important. Therefore, in this limit the
conﬁnement-induced molecular state behaves as a free
space bound state. Note that similar behavior is ob-
served in the paper by (Demkov and Drukarev, 1966).

states might be supported. Eq.(66) is derived by requir-
ing all the scattering channels to be closed yielding a
wavefunction that vanishes asymptotically. In this case

E(2) = 3(cid:126)ω⊥. The black dashed curve corresponds to
the energy of an s-wave molecular pair in the absence
of conﬁning trap, i.e. Ef ree/(cid:126)ω⊥ = − a2
. We observe
that the closed channel bound state (blue solid curve)
tends to 3(cid:126)ω⊥ as the ratio a⊥/as → −∞, i.e.in the ab-
sence of short range interaction. As the ratio a⊥/as
approaches the value −c1 = 1.46035 the bound state
from the closed channels becomes degenerate with the
threshold of the open channel, E(1) = (cid:126)ω⊥ (see black
star in Fig.17), and not coincidentally, the CIR reso-
nance occurs at a⊥/as = −c1 = 1.46035. Note that
at a⊥/as > 1.46035 and for energies less than E(1) the
depicted blue line does not have any physical signiﬁcance
and it is just an analytic continuation of Eq.(65). In this
energy regime all the channels should be closed and Eq.
(65) refers to the case where the system possess a single
open channel.

This analysis illustrates that the CIR has the charac-
ter of a Fano-Feshbach resonance, where the collective
bound state attached to all the closed channels lies in
the low-energy continuum of the open channel.
In ad-
dition, the conﬁnement-induced molecular state (see or-
ange solid line) exists regardless the strength of the short
range interactions. This is a manifestation of the im-
pact of the conﬁnement since in free space collisions the
bosonic pair forms a weakly bound state only for posi-
tive values of the s-wave scattering length. On the pos-
itive side of the abscissa in Fig. 17 as the ratio a⊥/as
increases we observe that the energy of free space weakly

in two hyperﬁne states
|F = 9/2, mF = −9/2(cid:105) and
|F = 9/2, mF = −7/2(cid:105). Note that the third hyperﬁne
|F = 9/2, mF = −5/2(cid:105) is not populated initially. The
mutual interactions are tuned via a Feshbach resonance
whose position is located at B = 202.1G and its zero-
crossing is at B = 210G. Thereafter, by employing radio-
frequency spectroscopy conﬁnement-induced molecules
are generated and their binding energy is measured as
a function of the scattering length and the conﬁne-
ment frequency. In Fig. 18 the binding energies of the
conﬁnement-induced (black solid line and squares) and
the Feshbach (blue solid line and circles) molecule are
depicted as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld. The solid
lines denote the theoretical predictions of (Dickerscheid
and Stoof, 2005) whereas the scattered data are the ex-
perimental measurements. The blue dashed line indicates
the position of the Feshbach resonance where a Feshbach
molecule (blue line and circles) is only formed on the pos-
itive side of the resonance whereas no measurement oc-
curs on the negative side. On the other hand, in the case

of conﬁnement-induced molecule (black line and squares)
we observe that there is always a bound state regardless
the sign of the s-wave interactions. This is in accordance
with the theoretical predictions.
In addition, we may
note that the intersection point of the black line with the
blue dashed line, i.e.at the position of inﬁnite scattering
length, the binding energy acquires its universal value,
i.e., EB ≈ 0.6(cid:126)ω⊥. At this universal value the bind-
ing energy of the conﬁnement-induced molecules depends
solely on the strength of the conﬁnement. Note that the
strength of the conﬁnement in (Moritz et al., 2005) is
tuned by changing the lattice depth V0. Fig. 19 depicts
the binding energy of the conﬁnement-induced molecule
as a function of the conﬁnement strength in units of re-
coil energy Er. The black solid line refers to theoreti-
cal calculations and the scatter data indicate the radio-
frequency measurements. Both theory (Dickerscheid and
Stoof, 2005) and experiment show suﬃcient agreement.

In the above mentioned analysis of s-wave conﬁnement
induced resonances it is evident that zero-range approx-
imations are employed. This means that the short-range
part of the Hamiltonian is treated in essence as a sin-
gle channel. In experiments, however, (see Fig. 18) the
main toolkit to tune the interactions or the s-wave scat-
tering length are the Feshbach resonances. This partic-
ular aspect implies that the short-range part must be
treated as a two-channel model in order to obtain a di-
rect comparison with the corresponding experimental ad-
vances. Towards this pathway a tremendous amount of
theoretical eﬀort is focused in order to incorporate ad-
equately the two-channel nature of Feshbach resonances

36

in the conﬁnement-induced physics (Kristensen and Pri-
coupenko, 2015; Peng et al., 2012; Saeidian et al., 2012;
Yurovsky, 2005, 2006). All these works pointed out the
importance of the eﬀective range corrections particularly
on the calculation of the binding energy of conﬁnement-
induced molecules.
In addition, it was shown that the
eﬀective range corrections become more important for
narrow Feshbach resonances. Note that similar conclu-
sions were drawn also for fermionic species in harmonic
waveguides (Saeidian et al., 2015).

Another aspect which was excluded from Refs. (Berge-
man et al., 2003; Demkov and Drukarev, 1966; Olshanii,
1998) is that the total colliding energy is suﬃcient for
the pair atoms such that no excitation will occur be-

2015; Moore et al., 2004; Saeidian et al., 2008) pre-
dicted numerically (Saeidian et al., 2008) and analyti-
cally (Heß et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2004) the emergent
inelastic conﬁnement-induced resonances for bosonic and
fermionic exchange symmetries. In particular,(Heß et al.,
2015) considered also the higher partial wave interactions
going beyond s- and p-wave interactions and obtained
universal expressions for the position of all the inelastic
conﬁnement-induced resonances.

A study by (Kim et al., 2006) studied distinguishable
particle collisions in the presence of a harmonic waveg-
uide which yield the eﬀect of dual conﬁnement-induced
resonances. This type of resonances correspond to total
transmission due to the destructive interference of s- and
p- partial waves. The importance of high partial waves
on bosonic or fermionic systems in a cigar shaped trap
were considered by (Giannakeas et al., 2012). Due to
the anisotropy of the trap all the partial waves associ-
ated with either bosonic or fermionic exchange symme-
try are coupled yielding in this manner coupled (cid:96)-wave
conﬁnement-induced resonances. The analysis of this
particular system is based on the idea of the local frame
transformation. This framework was employed for high-
lighting the underlining physics of fermionic collisions in
matter waveguides by (Granger and Blume, 2004) avoid-
ing the complications of zero-range and two-channel mod-
els. The following focuses on a system of spin-polarized
fermions in the presence of cigar-shaped traps and the
underlying details of the local frame transformation the-
ory.

2. Fermions in a cigar-shaped trap

It is also of extensive experimental and theoretical in-
terest to explore near-degenerate fermionic gases in low
dimensional traps, which requires a detailed understand-
ing of conﬁnement-induced resonances between identical
fermions.
In (Granger and Blume, 2004), a scattering
theory was developed to describe collisions between iden-

tical spin-polarized fermions in the presence of an axially
symmetric harmonic trap. Owing to the Pauli exclusion
principle, ultracold fermions interact in 3D with p-wave
interactions instead of s-wave that was considered in the
previous subsection. The p-wave theory requires some-
what diﬀerent considerations, which we therefore con-
sider in this subsection from the general viewpoint of the
K-matrix theory; this highlights the behavior imposed
on spin-polarized fermionic ensembles by the transverse
trapping potential.

Again, the relative Hamiltonian for two spin-polarized
fermions expressed in cylindrical coordinates has the
same form as in given in Eq. (61).
In contrast with
the previous s-wave treatment, the spherically symmet-
ric two-body interaction is not modeled by a pseudopo-
tential. Instead the formulation works directly with the
short-range phase shift caused by the spherical symmet-
ric two-body atomic interaction.
In the following, az-
imuthal symmetry is assumed and our analysis is re-
stricted to only m = 0.

In practice the length scales associated with the two
potential terms in Hamiltonian H are well separated,
with r0 of the short range potential typically orders of
magnitude smaller than the waveguide potential oscil-
lator length in a typical ultracold experiment, a⊥ =
(cid:112)(cid:126)/(µω⊥). At small interparticle distance r << a⊥, the
orbital angular momentum is approximately conserved
and therefore the two fermions experience a free-space
collision with total colliding energy E = (cid:126)2k2/(2µ). As
usual, µ denotes the two-body reduced mass.
In this
case the (cid:96)(cid:48)-th linearly independent energy eigenstate ex-
pressed in spherical coordinates has the following form
at r0 << r << a⊥:

Ψ(cid:96)(cid:48)(r) =

(cid:88)

(cid:96)

F(cid:96)(r, θ)δ(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48) − G(cid:96)(r, θ)K 3D
(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48) ,

(67)

where F(cid:96)(r, θ) (G(cid:96)(r, θ)) is the energy normalized regular
(irregular) solution expressed in terms of spherical Bessel
j(cid:96)(r) (spherical Neumann n(cid:96)(r)) functions multiplied by
the corresponding spherical harmonic Y(cid:96),m=0(θ, φ). The
summation is performed over all odd (cid:96) angular momen-
tum due the Pauli exclusion principle. The quantity K 3D
(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48)
represents the elements of the reaction matrix K 3D in
three-dimensions. This K-matrix incorporates all the
scattering information due to the short-range potential
Vsh(r), and for a spherically symmetric potential it is
diagonal, but for anisotropic interactions such as the
dipole-dipole type it could acquire oﬀ-diagonal elements
in other contexts (Giannakeas et al., 2013).

At large distances the waveguide geometry prevails
and imposes cylindrical symmetry on the wave func-
tion, and the total collision energy gets apportioned be-
tween the transversal and longitudinal degrees of free-
dom. The energy can be expressed at |z| > r0 as
E = (cid:126)ω⊥(2n + |m| + 1) + (cid:126)2q2
n/(2µ), where the term
(cid:126)ω⊥(2n + |m| + 1) refers to the energy of the transver-

37

sal part of the Hamiltonian and qn is the channel mo-
mentum, i.e.is the momentum of the particles in the z
direction. In this region the n(cid:48)-th linearly-independent
scattering wave function at energy E can be expressed in
cylindrical coordinates as:

Ψn(cid:48)(r) =

(fn(z, ρ), gn(z, ρ)) are the energy normalized (regular,

of the trap. The speciﬁc form of the regular and irregular
solutions which obey the Pauli exclusion principle have

(69)
where Φn(ρ) are the m = 0 eigenfunctions of the two-
dimensional harmonic oscillator and the z-dependence
describes motion in the unbounded coordinate. For col-
lisions of spin-polarized fermions the factor z/|z| corre-
sponds to the anti-symmetrization operator.

From the Hamiltonian H in Eq. (61) it is evident that
the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation is non-separable
over all the conﬁguration space. However, as mentioned
above there are two distinct subspaces where the result-
ing Schr¨odinger equation is separable and where all the
relevant scattering information can be expressed in terms
of reaction matrices, namely K 3D [see Eq. (67)] and K 1D
[see Eq. (68)]. The main idea is to deﬁne a frame trans-
formation which will permit to express the K 1D reac-
tion matrix in terms of the short range K 3D. Intuitively,
the frame transformation U permits us to propagate out-
wards to the asymptotic region the information of the
collisional events occurred close to the origin.

An unusual property of this frame transformation is
that it is not unitary. This arises due to the fact that
the solutions given in Eq. (67) and Eq. (68) obey diﬀer-
ent Schr¨odinger equations. However, since Hamiltonian
H in Eq. (61) possesses length scale separation imply-
ing the existence of an intermediate region where both
potentials are negligible. This means that in this sub-
space Eqs. (67) and (68) approximately satisfy the same
Schr¨odinger equation, i.e.the Helmholtz equation. There-
fore,
in this Helmholtz region one employs locally the
above mentioned frame transformation. The concept of
the local frame transformation was introduced by (Fano,
1981a; Harmin, 1982a,b) and extended by (Giannakeas
et al., 2016; Granger and Blume, 2004; Greene, 1987;
Robicheaux et al., 2015; Wong et al., 1988; Zhang and
Greene, 2013).

The local frame transformation is derived by matching
the energy normalized regular solutions fn(r) and F(cid:96)(r)

on a surface σ at a ﬁnite distance r0 < r < a⊥ inside
the Helmholtz region. Formally, for r < a⊥ U obeys the
relation

fn(r) =

(cid:88)

(cid:96)

F(cid:96)(r)U T

(cid:96)n, with U T

(cid:96)n = (cid:104)(cid:104)F(cid:96)|fn(cid:105)(cid:105) , for r < a⊥,

(70)
where U T denotes the transpose of the frame transforma-
tion matrix U , the symbol (cid:104)(cid:104)·|·(cid:105)(cid:105) indicates that the solu-
tions F(cid:96) and fn are integrated only over the solid angle
Ω = (θ, φ). Note that the matrix elements U are inde-
pendent of the distance r. This occurs since the matching
of the regular solutions takes place in the Helmholtz re-
gion where both solution possess same r dependence. In
addition, since the set of solutions in Eqs. (67) and (68)
are real standing-wave solutions, the matrix U is real.

It was pointed out by (Fano, 1981a) that the irreg-
ular parts of Eqs. (67) and (68) can be interconnected
by matching in the Helmholtz region the corresponding
principal value Green’s functions, written in the diﬀer-
ent coordinate systems. Formally, the irregular solutions
obey:

38

both exponentially decaying and growing pieces. There-
fore, in order to enforce the physically accepted asymp-
totic boundary conditions in Eq. (68) concepts from mul-
tichannel quantum defect theory are employed (Aymar
et al., 1996).

Initially, the scattering wave function in Eq. (68) is sep-
arated into open (“o“) and closed (”c“) channels. Then,
linear combinations are chosen by demanding that the
exponentially growing pieces in the closed channels are
canceled. Formally, we have the following relation for the
wave function:

(73)

After inserting Eqs. (70) and (71) into the scattering
wave function Ψ(r) in Eq. (67), the K 1D matrix is seen to
be expressed in terms of the short range K 3D compactly
as

K 1D = U K 3DU T ,

(72)

where the short range K 3D includes all the odd partial
waves for the spin-polarized fermions. Also, the K 1D
matrix depends on the total collision energy E.

The K 1D matrix contains information about the
asymptotically open- and closed-channel components of
the wavefunctions. To describe the closed-channel com-
ponents, solutions given in Eq. (68) can be analytically
continued by setting the channel momentum qn to be
qn → i|qn|, in the usual spirit of quantum defect theory.
Then one can derive the local frame transformation U
which possesses the same functional form as for the open
channels. Note that the local frame transformation U
in the open channels only for p-wave interactions obeys
(cid:113) 3
k ) where P(cid:96)(·) indi-
the relation U(cid:96)=1n =
kqn
cates the (cid:96)-th Legendre polynomial. This yields the same
expression for K 1D shown in Eq. (72). The only draw-
back from these manipulations is that the resulting K 1D
matrix corresponds to a scattering solution which does
not (yet) obey the proper boundary conditions asymp-
totically. This is because the closed channel parts of the
wave function given in Eq. (68) contains exponentially
growing pieces at |z| → ∞. One sees readily after sub-
stituting qn → i|qn| that the regular and irregular solu-
tions in Eq. (69) for the closed channel components have

P(cid:96)=1( qn

The resonances of the collision complex appear as poles
matrix. More speciﬁcally, the K 1D, phys

exhibits resonant features at zero eigenvalues of the ma-
trix (1 − iK 1D
cc ). Therefore, this argument can be recast
into the form of a determinantal equation:

oo

det(1 − iK 1D

cc ) = 0.

(76)

Note that despite the appearance of the imaginary unit
i in the preceding equations, all of these physical wave-
functions and reaction matrices are real. When all chan-
nels are closed, the roots of Eq. (76) yield the bound
state energies. When one or more channels are energeti-
cally open, the roots of the above closed-channel determi-
nant approximately identify the real parts of resonance
energies. Eq. (76) shows why a conﬁnement-induced res-
onance can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach type of reso-
nance.

Consider next the situation where the two fermions col-
lide in the single mode regime, meaning that the relative
collision energy lies between the lowest two transverse
thresholds.
In addition, these ultracold spin-polarized
fermions interact at short distances via p-wave interac-
tions only. Phase shifts associated with higher 3D partial
waves are entirely neglected. Accordingly, the determi-
nantal equation has one nonzero root, and the K 1D, phys
matrix takes the following form:

inﬁnite sum which formally diverges and in order to
obtain a meaningful answer an auxiliary regularization
scheme is employed. In the particular case a Riemann
zeta function regularization scheme is used. Note that
such techniques are totally avoided in the generalized
form of the local frame transformation theory (Gian-
nakeas et al., 2016; Robicheaux et al., 2015).
In ad-
dition, Eq. (77) is further simpliﬁed by substituting
(K 3D)(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48) = tan δ(cid:96)=1(E)δ(cid:96)(cid:48),1δ(cid:96)(cid:48)(cid:48),1, i.e. using the fact that
only p-wave phase shifts δ(cid:96)=1(E) are non-zero. Next,
in Eq. (77) we substitute the corresponding local frame
transformation for the closed channels only U(cid:96)=1n =

The quantity of greatest experimental relevance is
the eﬀective interaction strength between two 1D spin-
polarized fermions which contains the corresponding p-
wave conﬁnement-induced physics. As was shown in (Gi-
rardeau and Olshanii, 2004; Kanjilal and Blume, 2004;
Pricoupenko, 2008) this eﬀective 1D interaction is related
to the corresponding K-matrix [see Eq. (78)] according

The left (or right) arrow indicates that the derivative op-
erator acts on the bra (or ket) respectively. In the ideal-
ized limit of a zero-range potential, this pseudopotential
produces a discontinuous wavefunction that obeys the re-
quired antisymmetry of the identical fermion wavefunc-
tion. This might seem problematical since one normally
requires wavefunctions in Schr¨odinger wave mechanics to
be continuous, but it can be accommodated theoretically
as is discussed, for instance, by (Cheon and Shigehara,
1999).

Fig.20 illustrates the dependence of the eﬀective cou-
pling constant g−
1D as a function of the Vp/a3
⊥ in the low-
energy regime. The two fermions interact strongly at the
position of p-wave conﬁnement-induced resonance (see
the red star in Fig.20) whereas in the limit of Vp/a3
⊥ → 0
the corresponding eﬀective interaction vanishes. Interest-
ingly, for strong p-wave interactions, i.e. Vp/a3
⊥ → ±∞
the spin-polarized fermions experience a weak attrac-
tion due the transversal harmonic conﬁnement. The
location of this divergent interaction strength is called
the p-wave conﬁnement-induced resonance, and it occurs
where the scattering volume of the p-wave phase shift
is ﬁnite and satisﬁes the resonance condition, namely
Vp/a3

⊥ = [12ζ(−1/2, 3/2 − E/(2(cid:126)ω⊥))]−1.

Apparently,

the theoretical scope of conﬁnement-
induced resonances is addressed mainly to the elastic
collisional aspects of particles with either bosonic or
fermionic exchange symmetry. However, in the exper-
imental advances of (G¨unter et al., 2005; Haller et al.,
2010; Lamporesi et al., 2010; Sala et al., 2013) the
conﬁnement-induced physics is probed via atom loss mea-
surements which inherently are inelastic scattering pro-
cesses. These processes mainly emerge due to mecha-
nisms, such as three-body recombination, coupling of the
two-body center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom,
spin-ﬂips etc. Theoretically, the few-body collisions in
the presence of external conﬁnement are investigated by

(G¨unter et al., 2005) experimentally investigated p-
wave collisions of spin-polarized fermions in the pres-
ence of cigar-shaped and pancake traps. The degener-
ate gas constitutes of fermionic 40K atoms where their
mutual
interactions are tuned by means of a p-wave
Feshbach resonance at 198 G which possesses a dou-
ble peaked feature. As was shown by (Ticknor et al.,
2004) et al the doublet structure of a p-wave magnetic
Feshbach resonance is associated with the diﬀerent pro-
jections of the orbital angular momentum, i.e.|m| = 1
and m = 0 for (cid:96) = 1 and it occurs due to the mag-
netic dipole-dipole interactions. (G¨unter et al., 2005) et
al.
showed that this feature yields particular signatures
also in low-dimensional arrangements. Qualitatively the
impact of the double-peaked Feshbach resonance is de-
picted in Fig.21 where three conﬁgurations are consid-
ered for pancake and cigar-shaped traps. In particular,
panel (a) corresponds in a pancake trap where all the
projection alignments, i.e.|m| = 1 and m = 0, are con-
sidered. In Fig.21(b) a cigar-shaped trap is considered
whose longitudinal direction is perpendicular to the mag-
netic ﬁeld. This implies that the |m| = 1 conﬁguration of
the p-wave Feshbach resonance mainly contributes in the
scattering process whereas collisional events associated
with m = 0 component of the Feshbach resonance are
suppressed. Finally, in Fig.21(c) the quasi-one dimen-
sional trap is aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld, whereby
the m = 0 component dominates the p-wave collisions.

By measuring the atom loss signal the impact of the
multiplet Feshbach resonance is illustrated in Fig.22 for

only the |m| = 1 component of p-wave resonance is pro-
nounced whereas the trapping potential induces a shift
with respect to the corresponding resonance in Fig.22(a).

the |m| = 0 component of the Feshbach resonance con-
tributes appreciably, and it is shifted towards larger val-
ues of ﬁeld strength with respect to the corresponding

measurements of Fig.22(a) verifying in this manner the
theoretical predictions of (Granger and Blume, 2004). Fi-
nally, a tight three-dimensional optical lattice is consid-
ered in Fig.22(e) where no pronounced losses are observed
since the atoms are eﬀectively conﬁned in “zero” dimen-
sions and asymptotic scattering states are restricted.

From a theoretical viewpoint, (Peng et al., 2014) con-
sidered fermionic collisions around a p-wave Feshbach
resonance in the presence of quasi-two-and quasi-one-
dimensional traps. In particular, (Peng et al., 2014) takes
into account the multiplet structure of the p-wave Fesh-
bach resonance and study within a zero-range model the
impact of the relative orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld
with the trapping potentials on the collisional processes.
In this manner, the experimentally, i.e.(G¨unter et al.,
2005), observed spin alignment-dependent conﬁnement-
induced resonances for spin-polarized fermions were also
veriﬁed theoretically by (Peng et al., 2014).

B. Conﬁnement-induced resonances: delving deeper

The above discussion has only considered quasi-one di-
mensional harmonic type of conﬁnement for producing
conﬁnement-induced resonances. The rapid technologi-
cal advances in laser trapping techniques have opened a
new avenue that enables ultracold atoms to be conﬁned
in arbitrary geometries. From a theoretical viewpoint,
this requires extensions of the boundaries of our under-
standing of conﬁnement-induced physics to include more
general types of trapping potentials. Many of the gener-
alizations discussed in the present subsection have been
reviewed in (Blume, 2012a; Zinner, 2012)

In this direction, (Idziaszek and Calarco, 2006; Petrov
et al., 2000a; Petrov and Shlyapnikov, 2001; Pricoupenko,
2008) considered ultracold collisions in the presence of
quasi-two dimensional traps. In particular, (Petrov and
Shlyapnikov, 2001) within the zero range approximation
studied bosonic collisions in pancake-shaped traps. The
pancake trap modiﬁes the properties of 3D binary colli-
sions yielding two-dimensional conﬁnement-induced res-
onances. This particular type of resonance also fulﬁlls a
Fano-Feshbach scenario as do the quasi-one-dimensional
resonances. However, due to the pancake geometry
a conﬁnement-induced resonance occurs when the two-
body potential is not suﬃciently deep to produce a true
3D universal bound state, i.e. where the corresponding
free space scattering length is negative. Again, this dif-
fers from the quasi-one-dimensional conﬁnement-induced
resonances in the low energy limit, which occur at pos-
itive values of the s-wave scattering length. The the-
oretical predictions of (Petrov and Shlyapnikov, 2001)
were experimentally conﬁrmed by (Fr¨ohlich et al., 2011).
(Fr¨ohlich et al., 2011) explored the collisional aspects of a
two-component Fermi gas in a pancake trap around a free
space Fano-Feshbach resonance. By employing radio-

41

frequency spectroscopic techniques measured molecule
formation on the negative side of Fano-Feshbach reso-
nance.

(Idziaszek and Calarco, 2005; Peng et al., 2010) stud-
ied conﬁnement-induced resonances in the presence of an
anisotropic waveguide, using a pseudopotential model of
the two-body collisions. The anisotropy is induced by
considering a transverse harmonic potential in the x − y
plane, with diﬀerent frequencies in the x and y directions.
Theory suggests that the system in this type of geom-
etry possesses only one conﬁnement-induced resonance,
whose position can be tuned by adjusting the conﬁning
frequency aspect ratio (Peng et al., 2010). Moreover, sim-
ilar conclusions emerged from (Zhang and Zhang, 2011)
which considered a two-channel model for the short-range
3D interaction. The simple fact that an anisotropic har-
monic waveguide should exhibits only one conﬁnement-
induced resonance was not conﬁrmed by the experiment
of (Haller et al., 2010). More speciﬁcally, (Haller et al.,
2010) conducted experiments on Cs atoms conﬁned in
quasi-one-to-quasi-two dimensional traps. In the regime
of anisotropic traps through atom loss measurements
the corresponding observations showed signatures of two
conﬁnement-induced resonances.

The double peak feature was theoretically resolved by
proposing two possible loss mechanisms. One was as-
sociated with multichannel inelastic processes (Melezhik
and Schmelcher, 2011) and the second one was related
to the mere fact that trapping potential in the (Haller
et al., 2010) exhibit an anharmonicity (Peng et al., 2011;
Sala et al., 2012). The anharmonicity of trap induces
a coupling between the center-of-mass and relative de-
grees of freedom of the colliding pair. This coupling en-
ables the two particles to form a molecule without re-
quiring a third particle since the binding energy can be
distributed to the center of mass degrees of freedom. Af-
ter implementing these considerations in the theory, two
conﬁnement-induced resonances do indeed emerge which
conﬁrm the experimental observations of (Haller et al.,
2010). More recently, in order to pinpoint the physi-
cal origin of the double conﬁnement-induced resonances,
(Sala et al., 2013) considered experiments with 6Li atoms
in an anharmonic waveguide. More speciﬁcally, in that
experiment, the trapping potential was loaded with only
two 6Li atoms in the ground state of the external poten-
tial. Therefore, three-body eﬀects as well as multichan-
nel inelastic multichannel eﬀects were excluded (Melezhik
and Schmelcher, 2011). In this manner, it a double peak
structure was observed in atom loss measurements which
are attributed to two conﬁnement-induced resonances.

Dealing with ultracold collisions in arbitrarily-shaped
transversal potentials (Robicheaux et al., 2015; Zhang
and Greene, 2013) developed theories based on local
frame transformation theory, which can predict a broader
class of conﬁnement-induced resonances. These theo-
retical treatments also include two-body collisions be-

yond s or p-wave character.
In addition, (Robicheaux
et al., 2015) using ideas related to the Schwinger varia-
tional principle provide inﬁnity-free calculations of scat-
tering observables based on physical grounds, and avoids
the need for additional regularization schemes which
have been previously utilized in the pseudopotential ap-
proaches of (Granger and Blume, 2004; Olshanii, 1998;
Petrov and Shlyapnikov, 2001). However, in the treat-
ments of (Robicheaux et al., 2015; Zhang and Greene,
2013) the center of mass is coupled with the relative
degrees of freedom for particles of ﬁnite mass, so they
have thus far only been applied in the limit of an in-
ﬁnitely massive particle which is struck by a much lighter
one. (Peano et al., 2005) considered the coupling of the
center of mass in an arbitrary transversal potential, us-
ing the Green’s function formalism to solve the corre-
sponding Schr¨odinger equation directly in the laboratory
frame. Apart from arbitrary quasi-one-dimensional po-
tentials, (Peano et al., 2005) considered also the case of
two-component ultracold gases in harmonic traps where
atoms have diﬀerent polarizabilities; they therefore expe-
rience diﬀerent harmonic oscillator conﬁning frequencies
which results in coupled center-of-mass and relative de-

grees of freedom.
theoretically predicted that the corresponding scattering
observables should exhibit more than one resonant fea-
ture associated with the conﬁnement-induced resonances.
Similarly, (Kim et al., 2005) developed a theory yielding
only qualitative predictions since the Hilbert space as-
sociated with the closed channel physics was not taken
into account. This aspect, however was taken into ac-
count by (Melezhik and Schmelcher, 2009) which pre-
dicted conﬁnement-induced resonant molecular forma-
tion.

(Massignan and Castin, 2006) and (Nishida and Tan,
2008, 2010, 2011) focused on mixed-dimension collisions
in ultracold gases, under the assumption that diﬀerent
atomic species experience move in diﬀerent numbers of
spatial dimensions, such as when a 3D gas of atoms in-
teracts with either diﬀerent atoms or the same atoms
in diﬀerent internal states that are trapped in an opti-
cal lattice. Again, for this mixed-dimension system the
center of mass and relative degrees of freedom are in-
herently coupled. The concept of mixed dimensional-
ity arises from the fact that in a mixture of ultracold
gas diﬀerent particles, i.e. A and B species, experience
diﬀerent conﬁnement frequencies. The conﬁnement fre-
quencies depend on each atom’s polarizability and the
laser frequency. Therefore, by adjusting the laser fre-
quency at a zero of polarizability of one atomic species,
i.e.A atoms, only the B atoms will experience the trap-
ping potential. The proposed technique of (LeBlanc
and Thywissen, 2007; Massignan and Castin, 2006) for
species-selective dipole potentials was ﬁrst realized by
(Catani et al., 2009).
(Nishida and Tan, 2010) stud-
ied this idea by considering one atomic species, e.g. A

42

atoms, to be totally unconﬁned, i.e. they move in three
dimensions, while the B atoms are trapped in a tight
spherical trap (a “zero dimension” conﬁguration), or a
cigar-shaped (quasi-one-dimensional conﬁguration) trap-
ping potential, or a pancake-shaped trap (quasi-two di-
mensional conﬁguration).
In addition, particles A and
B are assumed to collide at small distances with s-wave
interactions only. This gives rise to an inﬁnite series of a
particular type of conﬁnement-induced resonances which
possess high orbital angular momentum character despite
the fact that the two-body collisions are dominated by
s-wave interactions. (Massignan and Castin, 2006) This
eﬀect emerges from the combination of pure s-wave in-
teractions and the fact that the two-body collisions take
place in mixed-dimensions which couples the angular mo-
menta of the A and B atomic species. The theoretical
predictions (Nishida and Tan, 2008, 2010) have appar-
ently been observed by (Lamporesi et al., 2010), who cre-
ated a mixed-dimensional conﬁnement of two ultracold
atomic species, namely 41K and 87Rb. The 41K atoms are
trapped in two-dimensions whereas the 87Rb atoms move
in three-dimensions, which is achieved by implement-
ing species-selective dipole trapping techniques (Catani
et al., 2009; LeBlanc and Thywissen, 2007; Massignan
and Castin, 2006).
In this mixed-dimensional conﬁgu-
ration (Lamporesi et al., 2010) observed up to ﬁve res-
onances by measuring 3-body losses, in good agreement
with theoretical resonance positions.

Pair collisions within a three-dimensional optical lat-
tice were theoretically investigated by (Cui et al., 2010;
Fedichev et al., 2004).
(Fedichev et al., 2004) utilized
the tight-binding framework and assumed that the range
of the two-body interactions is far smaller than the lat-
tice spacing, i.e. d, and the size of the ground state in
a lattice side, i.e. (cid:96)0. Also the curvature within the lat-
tice sites is approximated as a harmonic oscillator, which
permits a decoupling of the center of mass and relative
degrees of freedom. Furthermore, in the tight binding
model (Fedichev et al., 2004) assumed that the eﬀective
mass of the particles is large enough such that the size of
the ground state within the lattice site is small compared
to the lattice spacing whereas eﬀects arising from higher
Bloch bands were excluded. Based on these consider-
ations (Fedichev et al., 2004) predicted a conﬁnement-
induced resonance that occurs at negative values of the
s-wave scattering length. The resonance condition sim-
ply reads as ∼ (cid:96)∗, where (cid:96)∗ = (cid:96)0
D0/(4 ln 2), with D0
the tunneling amplitude to neighboring lattice sides in
the lowest Bloch band. (K¨ohl et al., 2005) conducted ex-
periments on a degenerate Fermi gas in the presence of
a three-dimensional optical lattice. They observed that
the Feshbach resonance within the optical lattice exhibits
an additional shift from the corresponding Feshbach res-
onance in the absence of the external potential, which
veriﬁed the theoretical predictions of (Fedichev et al.,
2004). (Cui et al., 2010) extended the theoretical stud-

√

ies of (Fedichev et al., 2004) and quantitatively described
Bloch wave scattering at diﬀerent lattice depths. Also,
higher Bloch bands are taken into account as well as in-
traband eﬀects which occur in the lowest Bloch band.
(Cui et al., 2010) showed that in the case of true molecu-
lar states and at moderate lattice depths the higher Bloch
bands eﬀects play crucial role since their neglect overes-
timates binding energies.

conﬁnement-induced resonance occurs only at smaller
values of the ratio as/a⊥, namely as/a⊥ ∼ 1/
2Ω. This
provides in essence an extra means to manipulate the
position of a CIR without the need of a Fano-Feshbach
resonance to tune the magnitude of the 3D scattering
length. Note that similar ﬁndings were reported also by
(Zhang and Zhang, 2013).

the
conﬁnement-induced physics in low dimensional systems
consider a regime where the two-body interactions are
short-ranged and isotropic. Lifting the latter constraint
permits us to generalize the concept of the conﬁnement-
induced resonances in physical systems which are mainly
governed by anisotropic binary interactions.

The experimental realization of spin-orbit coupled
Bose-Einstein condensates opens new avenues to explore
the collisional aspects of such exotic systems. Develop-
ments in this rapidly evolving ﬁeld have been reviewed
(Williams et al., 2012; Zhai, 2015). For exam-
by
ple,
in free space collisions, spin-orbit coupling yields
a mixed-partial wave scattering process that alters the
corresponding Wigner threshold law (Cui, 2012; Duan
(Zhang et al.,
et al., 2013; Wang and Greene, 2015).
2012; Zhang and Zhang, 2013; Zhang et al., 2014) stud-
ied the impact of reduced dimensionality on these phys-
ical systems in the presence of quasi-one and quasi-two
dimensional traps.

In particular, (Zhang et al., 2014) considers resonant
collisions of spin-orbit coupled cold atoms with Raman
coupling in the presence of an axially symmetric har-
monic waveguide. As a ﬁrst order approximation, eﬀects
due to the coupling of the center-of-mass and relative de-
grees of freedom are neglected by considering the case of
zero center-of-mass momentum. Then the relative Hamil-
tonian, apart from the kinetic energy, two-body and con-
ﬁnement potential terms, possesses two additional terms:
(i) The spin-orbit coupling term HSOC = γk

(ii) Raman coupling term HRaman = Ω

with i = x, z represents the spin Pauli matrices for each
particle, k indicates the relative kinetic energy, m is the

Raman coupling and γ = 2π(cid:126) sin(θ/2)/λ indicates the
spin-orbit coupling constant where λ is the Raman laser
wavelength and θ denotes the angle between the lasers.
Both spin-orbit and Raman coupling inﬂuence inher-
ently the position of the resulting conﬁnement-induced
resonance. A conﬁnement-induced resonance always ex-
ists regardless the sign of the s-wave scattering length
only in the case where the Raman coupling strength is

D. Conﬁned dipoles and dynamical CIR

Collisions of magnetic dipolar atoms or of polar
molecules pose another physical system whose two-body
interactions are inherently anisotropic. The concept of
conﬁnement-induced resonances for anisotropic two-body
interactions has been considered both for quasi-two and
quasi-one dimensional waveguide geometries. Such dipo-
lar systems hold particular interest in the many-body
realm for their potential to create novel new topological
phases of matter, in addition to quantum information ap-
plications. (Baranov, 2008; Baranov et al., 2012) In a nu-
merical study, (Hanna et al., 2012) explored the impact
of a pancake geometry on nonreactive polar molecules
where despite the fact that the conﬁning potential yield
broader resonances than in the absence of a trap, the lo-
cation of resonances are extremely sensitive to the dipole
moment strength.

Apart from pancake geometries, the concept of dipo-
lar conﬁnement-induced resonances is also investigated in
harmonic waveguides, i.e. in quasi-one dimensional traps
(Bartolo et al., 2013; Giannakeas et al., 2013; Sinha and
Santos, 2007) where the dipoles are aligned by an ex-
ternal ﬁeld in a head-to-tail conﬁguration.
In particu-
lar, (Giannakeas et al., 2013; Shi and Yi, 2014) apply
the local frame transformation theory and the pseudopo-
tential techniques, respectively, showed the existence of
a broad class of dipolar conﬁnement-induced resonances
which are characterized by mixed orbital angular momen-
tum character due to the dipole-dipole interactions and
the conﬁnement.

Moreover, for s-wave dominated dipolar conﬁnement-
induced resonances their position depends linearly on
the ratio of the length scale of dipolar forces over the
trapping length scale, i.e.∼ ld
. Note that (ld, a⊥) =
a⊥
(µd2/(cid:126)2, (cid:112)(cid:126)/µω⊥) where µ indicating the reduced mass
of the dipolar, d is the corresponding dipole moment and
ω⊥ indicates the conﬁnement frequency. This linear de-
pendence of position of the dipolar conﬁnement-induced
resonances on the ratio ld
means that the collisional
a⊥
properties of dipoles in the presence of a conﬁnement
can be controlled by adjusting the strength of an exter-
nal ﬁeld and conﬁning potential frequency in a regime
accessible by the experimental advances.

Furthermore, (Shi and Yi, 2014) showed that by tilt-
ing the relative orientation of the external electric ﬁeld
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the harmonic

waveguide provides additional means to reﬁne the tun-
ing of dipolar conﬁnement-induced resonance positions.
(Simoni et al., 2015) studied the case of reactive polar
molecules in cigar-shaped traps. In more detail (Simoni
et al., 2015) numerically studied the impact of the re-
duced dimensionality on elastic, inelastic and reaction
rates of collision of the reactive molecules in terms of the
collisional energy and the strength of the dipole moments.
The full four-body calculations are simpliﬁed by employ-
ing an asymptotic eﬀective two-body model at large dis-
tances where the reactions are suppressed (Micheli et al.,
2010). The reaction physics is introduced through a
WKB-type boundary conditions at short distances that
accounts for atom exchange phenomena. By varying the
angle of an external electric ﬁeld with respect to the lon-
gitudinal direction of the trap, i.e.trap axis, it is observed
that the reaction rate is greatly suppressed for angles
normal to the trap’s axis. For the case of a bosonic KRb
molecule the reaction rate can only be eﬃciently sup-
pressed under strong conﬁnement without yielding any
signiﬁcant advantages over the reaction rate suppression
in quasi-two dimensional trapping geometries.

Photon-assisted conﬁnement-induced resonances arise
when there is a dynamical mechanism to enhance res-
onant collisions in the presence of a waveguide.
(Ley-
ton et al., 2014) consider s-wave binary collisions in the
presence of an RF driven harmonic waveguide whose
conﬁning frequency modulation permits the separation
of the center of mass degrees freedom. The resulting
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is solved within
a zero-range approximation, i.e. using a Bethe-Peierls
boundary condition at the origin of the relative degrees
of freedom. The RF modulation of the transversal fre-
quency permits to the two counter-propagating atoms
to perform a transition from the continuum state to the
conﬁnement-induced molecular state by emitting one or
multiple photons. This dynamical mechanism of photon-
assisted conﬁnement-induced resonances can result into a
series of resonant features for a given number of photons.

E. Inelastic few-body collisions in 1D

An intriguing implication of the exact integrability of
the 1D Schr¨odinger equation for N equal mass parti-
cles that experience zero-range two-body potentials, and
the existence of an analytically known solution due to
(McGuire, 1964), is that there are no inelastic collisions.
One way to understand this is that every time two parti-
cles collide, the ﬁnal state of the two particles in momen-
tum space is kinematically identical to the initial state,
since transmission and reﬂection are indistinguishable.
While the absence of all inelasticity including three-body
recombination for this system is straightforwardly clear,
given the exact solution of (McGuire, 1964), it is far from
obvious how the inelasticity turns out to vanish when

44

studied in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation.
One way all inelasticity would vanish for a system would
be if the hyperradial degree of freedom in the Schr¨odinger
equation turns out to be exactly separable, because in
that case all nonadiabatic coupling matrices would van-
ish. It is not that simple, however, in the case of identi-
cal 1D bosons with zero-range interactions, because the
nonadiabatic coupling matrices are nonzero. Hence, the
diﬀerent adiabatic hyperspherical channels are coupled,
at least locally. This issue was explored by (Mehta and
Shepard, 2005), which numerically solved the coupled hy-
perradial equations that describe atom-dimer scattering.

Later, three-body recombination was calculated in this
1D identical boson system for both the zero range po-
tential case and for a ﬁnite-range potential by (Mehta
et al., 2007), again using the adiabatic hyperspherical
representation. That study conﬁrmed as well that there
is no inelasticity, i.e. vanishing three-body recombina-

tion rate coeﬃcient.
tion, the recombination rate and the rates of all other
inelastic processes vanish because there is complete de-
structive interference in the zero-range limit. For a 1D
potential of ﬁnite range L, however, the study showed
how the recombination rate increases for nonzero L > 0.
The near-threshold behavior of the recombination rate is
of interest for 1D and quasi-1D experiments, and it was
demonstrated in (Mehta et al., 2007) that three identi-
cal particles have the same threshold behavior K 1D
3 ∝ k7
regardless of whether the particles are spin polarized
fermions or bosons. For three identical bosons in partic-
ular, this study shows more concretely that in strict 1D,
3 = C(L)((cid:126)k/µ)(ka)6, where k is the 1D wavenumber
K 1D
and a is the 1D two-body scattering length. Experimen-
tal evidence is quite limited in this topic, but the results
measured to date, e.g. by (Tolra et al., 2004) appear
not to have reached a regime very close to the strict 1D
results, and are probably better viewed as probes of the
crossover regime between 1D and 3D or between 1D and
2D.

F. 2D, quasi-2D systems, and the super-Eﬁmov eﬀect

systems

Two-dimensional

in both few-body and
many-body physics exhibit rich and fascinating be-
havior,
involving logarithmic dependences of nearly
all quantities that depend on distance and energy.
In many-particle condensed-matter systems, prototyp-
ical phenomena that have generated extensive inter-
est include the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless(BKT)-
transitionm (Berezinskii, 1971; Kosterlitz and Thouless,
1973; Thouless et al., 1982) relating to the formation and
binding of 2D vortices, and of course the fractional quan-
tum Hall eﬀect
(Stormer et al., 1999). Underlying the
theoretical description of striking many-body phenomena

in 2D are the eﬀective two-body and three-body interac-
tions that are modiﬁed when a three-dimensional gas is
squeezed into a pancake-shaped trap geometry.

The modiﬁcation of the 3D atom-atom scattering in-
formation into an eﬀective 2D interaction has been ad-
dressed by many authors, e.g. (Kanjilal and Blume, 2006;
W´odkiewicz, 1991), with a more comprehensive list of ref-
erences in (Dunjko et al., 2011b). Implications of 2D con-
ﬁnement for three-body recombination and for the forma-
tion of many-body phases were treated by (Petrov et al.,
2000b), for a gas consisting of particles with ﬁnite-range
interactions. The three-body problem in 2D for short-
range interactions has more recently been examined in a
hyperspherical coordinate framework by (D’Incao et al.,
2015; D’Incao and Esry, 2014), including a nonpertur-
bative study of 3-body recombination in that geometry.
Two-body dipole-interacting particles in a 2D or quasi-
2D gas are treated by many publications, two of which are
(D’Incao and Greene, 2011; Kanjilal et al., 2007). The
intriguing many-body phenomena that arise in dipolar
systems have received extensive theoretical and exper-
imental attention, as has been reviewed in (Baranov,
2008; Baranov et al., 2012).

One class of few-body treatments in two dimensions re-
lates to fractional quantum Hall droplets having modest
numbers of particles, typically from 3-10 electrons, or in
the ultracold physics context, atoms or polar molecules.
A few such explorations in recent years can be found in
(Daily et al., 2015b; Rittenhouse et al., 2016; Wooten
et al., 2017), which are just a sampling of the work that
followed the famous work by (Laughlin, 1983) on three
2D electrons in a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. A de-
generate perturbation theory treatment of semiconduc-
tor quantum dots in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, which has
numerous cases that can serve as useful benchmark cal-
culations for comparison with few-body theory, can be
found in (Jeon et al., 2007).

A provocative few-body prediction in recent years has
been the super-Eﬁmov eﬀect, which deals with bound
states of 3 p-wave interacting fermions in 2D. (Gao et al.,
2015; Gridnev, 2014; Moroz, 2014; Nishida et al., 2013;
Volosniev et al., 2014) The interactions are assumed
in the derivation of this eﬀect to have a ﬁnite range,
and each interacting pair in the trimer is assumed to
have a zero-energy bound state in the symmetry with
|Lz| = 1, also referred to as a resonant p-wave inter-
action. The resulting trimer energy level formula pre-
dicted in this case takes the double-exponential form:
En ∝ exp[−2e3πn/4+θ] where θ is a nonuniversal constant
deﬁned modulo 3π/4.Because the size of these super-
Eﬁmov states grows so rapidly with n, and also the
successive binding energies shrink dramatically as n in-
creases, these will be challenging to observe experimen-
tally. Whereas the successive energy levels in the ordi-
nary homonuclear Eﬁmov eﬀect are less bound by a factor
of 515, the corresponding ratio in the super-Eﬁmov eﬀect

45

exceeds 109. More promising than the homonuclear sys-
tems are heavy-heavy-light heteronuclear trimers, whose
super-Eﬁmov states can display a more favorable scal-
ing, (Moroz, 2014) as is also the case in the ordinary
Eﬁmov eﬀect for heteronuclear trimers. Another explo-
ration of heavy-heavy-light trimers in 2D with resonant
p-wave interactions is based on the conventional Born-
Oppenheimer approximation (Efremov et al., 2013).

Recently, a theoretical treatment by (Nishida, 2017)
has introduced the “semi-super Eﬁmov eﬀect”. This is in
a system of four bosons in 2D, which exhibit a diﬀerent
scaling possible for an inﬁnite pattern of energy levels
and state sizes, in a scenario where the three-boson in-
teractions are resonant but the two-body interactions are
negligible. In the semi-super Eﬁmov case, the state sizes
are predicted to scale with the integer quantum number
n > 0 in proportion to exp[(πn)2/27].

The theory of the quasi-2D homonuclear three-boson
problem has been treated in detail by (Levinsen et al.,
2014; Yamashita et al., 2015). This topic is also some-
times referred to as the “crossover” from 3D to 2D. This
study demonstrated how the ﬁnite number of universal
3-body states in 2D, where there is no true Eﬁmov ef-
fect, (Bruch and Tjon, 1979; Nielsen et al., 2001; Nishida
and Tan, 2011) connect with true Eﬁmov states in 3D
as one varies the degree of conﬁnement in the transverse
dimension. Three fermions in 2D are also treated the-
oretically in (Ngampruetikorn et al., 2013), by solving
the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian(STM) integral equation
(Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian, 1957).

VI. FEW-BODY PHYSICS IN NUCLEAR AND
CHEMICAL SYSTEMS

In previous sections, the current state of the art of
few-body ultracold atomic physics has been presented,
with an extended discussion of universality in three-body
and four-body physics. However, the domain of few-body
physics clearly extends beyond atomic systems, reaching
many diﬀerent branches of physics such as chemistry or
nuclear or particle physics, among others. Indeed, few-
body physics was born in nuclear physics motivated by
the seminal paper of
(Thomas, 1935), as pointed out
above.

The premise of long de Broglie wavelength eﬀective
ﬁeld theory is that for the low energy physics of a few- or
many-body system below a certain characteristic energy
scale, the behavior of the system should not be sensi-
tive to the details of the Hamiltonian at distances much
less than λ.
Indeed, the physics behind such behavior
is closely related with the concept of renormalization
group theory (Wilson, 1971, 1983; Wilson and Kogut,
1974) One of the best pedagogical introductions to the
strategy of systematically building in the correct long
wavelength physics has been presented by (Lepage, 1989,

1997) in the context of nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger quan-
tum mechanics.
In fact, the concept of eﬀective ﬁeld
theory was spawned by the seminal work of Weinberg
that attempted to understand the role of pion-exchange
in nuclear forces (Weinberg, 1979, 1990, 1991). Exam-
ple applications to Eﬁmov physics and related few-body
systems have been developed in detail by (Braaten and
Hammer, 2006). Other studies that utilize model two-
body and three-body Hamiltonians that produce key in-
formation such as the low energy two-body scattering
length and eﬀective range are making use of the spirit
of low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theories even when they pro-
ceed via more direct solution of the few-body Schr¨odinger
equation. We note as well that trions, excitons, and
biexcitons occur as few-body problems in semiconductor
physics, as is discussed, e.g. by (Patton et al., 2003).

This section is devoted to the study of major devel-
opments in few-body physics relevant for nuclear physics
and chemistry. The few-body physics in chemical sci-
ences will be presented in two guises: ﬁrst, few-body
physics based on classical trajectory calculations in hy-
perspherical coordinates involving neutrals and charged
particles. Second, a full quantum mechanical treatment
revealing the underlying universality of three-body colli-
sions involving charged particles.

A. Hyperspherical methods in nuclear physics

The adiabatic hyperspherical technique has been in-
troduced in previous sections of the present review, with
examples of its methodology and applications in the ﬁeld
of atomic and molecular collisions. Reiterating, the basic
idea behind this method is to reduce a complex multidi-
mensional problem into set of coupled second-order ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations in a single variable. The same
idea can of course be applied in a ﬁeld with tremendously
diﬀerent energy and length scales: nuclear physics, where
the nature of the nucleon-nucleon and related interac-
tions exhibit all the complexities of the strong nuclear
force. For instance, both exotic nuclear systems and the
three-nucleon problem, to name two classes of problems,
have been studied using the adiabatic hyperspherical rep-
resentation.

In nuclear physics the adiabatic hyperspherical tech-
nique follows the same scheme as is presented above in
this review: the ﬁrst step involves solution of the hyper-
angular equation where the hyperradius R is treated as
a parameter, thereby giving hyperspherical potential en-
ergy curves and couplings. Then, these are employed to
solve a set of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations in
the radial coordinate. With this strategy one can tackle
the few- or many-nucleon interaction problem at diﬀer-
ent levels of sophistication. For instance, the cosmologi-
cally important reaction of three alpha particles to form
12C via the intermediate Hoyle state has been treated

46

within the coupled-channel adiabatic representation by
(Alvarez-Rodriguez et al., 2007, 2008; Suno et al., 2015).
The calculation of hyperspherical potential curves and
couplings by (Suno et al., 2015) was based on a bi-
nary α − α model Hamiltonian that accurately describes
the 8Be resonance state, and a three-body term was cho-
sen to represent some experimentally-known properties
of 12C such as some particular energy levels. The ﬁnal
calculation gives a good energy and width in agreement
with experimental values for the J π
2 Hoyle reso-
nance state. The relevant adiabatic hyperspherical po-
tential curves are shown in Fig. 23.

resonance thought to be important in nucleosynthesis. Inset:
the adiabatic potential curves at large hyper-radius.

Note that when this technique is applied to few-nucleon
systems, one must keep in mind the distinctively diﬀer-
ent nature of the nucleon-nucleon forces compared to the
atom-atom interactions. This diﬀerence comes from the
fact that nuclear collisions can be understood to ﬁrst or-
der as resulting from the exchange of virtual pions be-
tween nucleons. In this sense, pions (π) can be viewed as
the quanta of the nuclear force, and since they represent
a massive scalar ﬁeld their inﬂuence is associated with a
Yukawa potential e−mπ r/4πr (Weinberg, 1991). Indeed,
the nucleon-nucleon potential can be modeled using an
eﬀective ﬁeld theory based on the exchange of pions. This
exchange leads to new and complicated interaction terms
in the nucleon-nucleon potential, among them, the tensor
interaction reads

V (rij) = Vt(rij)(τi · τj)

(cid:34)

(σi · rij)(σj · rij)

(cid:35)

− σi · σj

(81)
where σi and τi represent the nuclear spin and isospin
of nucleon i, respectively. For a more detailed modern
view of the nucleon-nucleon forces, including pion-less
theories and chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we recommend

Ref.(Epelbaum et al., 2009).

The very complicated nature of the nucleon-nucleon
interaction does not prevent the success of the adiabatic
hyperspherical technique in nuclear physics, indeed hy-
perspherical coordinates were applied in the context of
nuclear physics by (Delves, 1960) and (Smith, 1960) to
study three-body nuclear systems (Fang and Tomusiak,
1977; Levinger, 1974; Valliers et al., 1976; Verma and
Sural, 1979). Those studies, however, did not implement
the adiabatic formulation and thus could not beneﬁt from
its insights and accelerated convergence. Hyperspheri-
cal methods were also applied to exotic nuclei, such as
the hypertriton, and complex nuclei by including realis-
tic nucleon-nucleon potentials (Clare and Levinger, 1985;
Verma and Sural, 1979, 1982). The potential employed
included the tensor interaction and many other compo-
nents of the nucleon-nucleon force. In general, many the-
orists preferred to work with a set of coupled integral
equations instead of coupled diﬀerential equations, which
can be regarded as a procedure diﬀerent from the adia-
batic hyperspherical machinery most frequently adopted
in atomic physics. More recently, however, the adiabatic
hyperspherical approach has been employed to compute
the triton bound state energy (Daily et al., 2015a) in a
convergence exploration, using realistic nucleon-nucleon
potentials with a three-body force as well. Other systems
that have been considered include exotic species such as
kaonic clusters involving three and four particles (Kez-
erashvili et al., 2015).

B. Universality in nuclear systems

As discussed above, the nuclear forces are fundamen-
tally diﬀerent from the interactions in the context of ul-
tracold atomic physics, since they derive from the electro-
magnetic interaction. Therefore, due to the very strong
and short-ranged nature of the nuclear interactions, some
aspects of universality can be expected to diﬀer in nuclear
systems compared with atomic and molecular species. In
particular, some nuclear systems form halo nuclei (Co-
bis et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 2004a; Tanihata, 1996;
Zhukov, 1993), which is a nuclear bound state formed
by a tightly bound core and one or two valence nucle-
ons. These valence nucleons are characterized to have a
very small binding energy in comparison with the bind-
ing energy of the core nucleons, which is reﬂected in a
highly extended bound state wave function. For this rea-
son, halo nuclei exhibit very large radii compared to the
core radius. The most familiar example of a halo nucleus
is the deuteron, with an average neutron-proton separa-
tion of 3.1 fm that is three times larger than both the
size of its component nucleons and the range of their
interaction potential (both ≈ 1f m). While halos also ex-
ist in atomic and molecular physics, they are far more
prevalent in nuclear systems, with many studies even in

47

(Hove
large or medium-sized nuclei. See for instance
et al., 2014, 2016) and references therein.
In fact Eﬁ-
mov physics can be relevant to describing aspects of the
wavefunction of a medium-sized nucleus like 62Ca with
two outlying nucleons, (Hagen et al., 2013). Neverthe-
less this type of system exempliﬁes the Eﬁmov-unfavored
scenario with two light particles and one heavier parti-
cle that is discussed in (Wang et al., 2012d); based on
the arguments presented there, it is unlikely that a “true
Eﬁmov state” exists in such systems.

Halo nuclei with two valence nucleons represent a good
playground for three-body physics, since these nuclear
systems are potential candidates to exhibit some proper-
ties associated with Eﬁmov physics despite being Eﬁmov-
unfavored. These nuclides are found in the bottom of
the neutron drip line: the line that describes the bound-
ary beyond which the neutron-rich nuclides are unstable.
Among the diﬀerent kinds of two nucleon halo nuclei,
the Borromean 2 halo nuclei have received special atten-
tion since these have a three-body bound state, despite
the fact that none of the two-body subsystems is bound.
The most studied Borromean halo nuclei to date have
been 6He and 11Li (Tanihata, 1996; Zhukov, 1993). A
schematic representation of one such nucleus is shown in
the inset of Fig. 24, concretely for 6He. In this case, the
core is an α particle and the two valence nucleons are
neutrons.

2 The term Borromean is associated with the coat of arms of the
house of Borromeo family in the north of Italy, which consists in
three interlayer rings. In particular, the symbol appears in the
left escutcheon of the coat of arms. However, a similar symbol
involving three triangles was already used in Norse mythology
around the 7th century.

48

Their study suggested that 20C is the only halo nucleus
candidate that has appreciable Eﬁmov state character,
other than the triton.

Apart from normal nuclei, namely those that appear
in the table of nuclides, there other hypernuclei con-
tain strange quarks, and are the so-called strange nuclei.
Some of these are classiﬁed as halo nuclei, and among
them the simplest case is the hypertriton 3
ΛH: a three-
body bound state formed by a neutron, a proton and
the Λ0. The Λ0 is the lightest Λ hyperon, a neutrally
charged baryon similar to a neutron but slightly heavier,
and its quark structure is uds; it has strangeness -1. The
total binding energy of 3
ΛH is ≈ 2.4 MeV (Fujiwara et al.,
2008), whereas its breakup energy is ∼ 0.14 MeV (Fuji-
wara et al., 2008), which is very small in comparison with
the binding energy of the deuteron 2.22 MeV, and hence
it can be considered as a two-nucleon halo nucleus. In-
deed, it has been extensively studied (Cobis et al., 1997;
Fedorov and Jensen, 2002; Gongleton, 1992). All of these
studies suﬀer, however, from needing better experimen-
tal information concerning the n-Λ scattering length, so
these works might be considered as qualitative or semi-
quantitative approaches to the Eﬁmov nature of the hy-
pertriton. Nevertheless, new data coming from ALICE
and STAR may help to understand better the nature of
the n-Λ interaction, as well as to yield more accurate mea-
surements of the lifetime of 3
ΛH (ALICE Collaboration,
2016; STAR Collaboration, 2010; Zhu, 2013). On the
other hand, a good understanding of the hyperon-nucleon
interaction is needed for a proper understanding of high-
density matter systems, such as neutron stars (Lattimer
and Prakash, 2004; Lonardoni et al., 2014; Vida˜na, 2013;
Weber et al., 2007).

In nuclear systems, universal properties in the four-
body sector can be identiﬁed. The clearest example is
the case of the Tjon line (Tjon, 1975): a correlation be-
tween the binding energy of the α particle and the tri-
ton binding energy that persists across nearly all nucleon
interaction models; in particular, this correlation is ap-
proximately linear. The origin of the Tjon correlation
can be explained as an approximate independence of the
four-body energy level spectrum on any four-body pa-
rameter. In other words, the Tjon analysis suggests that
there is no need for a four-body parameter for the renor-
malization at leading order in the four-body sector (Plat-
ter et al., 2005, 2004), for energy levels in the universal
regime. However, higher order corrections break the ex-
pected correlation leading to a band with some scatter
depending on the short range physics, instead of a simple,
well-deﬁned line (Nogga et al., 2000).

C. Few-body physics and universality in chemistry

Traditionally the term few-body physics has been em-
ployed in nuclear physics, and subsequently it became

Figure 24 (Color online) Phillips plot for the triton energy
ET as a function of the doublet nd scattering length a2
nd. The
red dots stand for diﬀerent theoretical calculations based on
diﬀerent kinds of two-body and three-body interactions (Be-
nayoun et al., 1981; Fedorov and Jensen, 2002; Friar et al.,
1984), whereas the blue square represents the experimental
result. For a more detailed presentation of the Phillips plot
for the triton, see the work of Eﬁmov and Tkachenko (Eﬁmov
and Tkachenko, 1988). Inset: schematic representation of a
halo nuclei with two valence nucleons, namely 6He.

On the other hand, three-body bound states in some
nuclear systems show a universal behavior: a correla-
tion between the dimer-nucleon scattering length and the
nucleon trimer binding energy, which is known as the
Phillips line (Phillips, 1968). This correlation is indepen-
dent of the model employed for the calculations: such as
a two-body contact interaction, three-body interaction
terms, and it should also be present regardless of the
method employed, i.e. an eﬀective ﬁeld theory approach,
adiabatic hyperspherical treatment, or low energy Fad-
deev equations. Fig. 24 presents a Phillips plot for the
triton including diﬀerent theoretical results as well as the
experimental data. This ﬁgure exhibits a linear correla-
tion between the triton binding energy and the doublet
neutron-deuteron scattering length a2
nd. However, other
kinds of correlation may occur in diﬀerent three-body
nuclear bound states, see e.g. the work of Fedorov and
Jensen (Fedorov and Jensen, 2002).

At least two halo nuclei have been seen as potential
candidates to exhibit Eﬁmov universality. However, the
universality can only be claimed convincingly if the dif-
ferent excited state of the three-body system follow the
predicted scaling law by Eﬁmov, and those are not experi-
mentally accessible by any currently existing capabilities.
For instance in the case of 6He, which is also Borromean,
it has been proven that a p-wave resonance exists in the
J = 3/2 channel of n − α scattering which explains the
nature of the three-body bound state. However, in the
1990’s (Fedorov et al., 1994) and (Amorim et al., 1997)
explored the Eﬁmov character of several halo nuclei, as-
suming that the ground state is also an Eﬁmov state.

tracold atomic systems (Burt et al., 1997; de Goey et al.,
1986; Esry et al., 1999; Fedichev et al., 1996a; Hess et al.,
1983, 1984; Suno et al., 2003a; Weber et al., 2003). How-
ever, in chemical physics it has not be the case, even
though chemical physics studies hinge on our understand-
ing of few-body physics. And of course a deep under-
standing of fundamental processes in chemical physics is
frequently needed in other ﬁelds of physics and chem-
istry, notably in astrophysics, such as the three-body
recombination of hydrogen in stellar formation(Flower
and Harris, 2007; Forrey, 2013); in theoretical chemistry:
transport coeﬃcients in gases(Hirschfelder et al., 1954;
K¨ohl and Schaefer, 1983; Mason and Monchick, 1962;
McCourt et al., 1991; Montero and P´erez-R´ıos, 2014;
Snider, 1960; Wang-Chang et al., 1964), reactive and
non-reactive scattering(Child, 1974; Levine and Bern-
stein, 1987; Shui, 1972; Truhlar and Muckerman, 1975)
and three-body recombination(Ermolova et al., 2014;
Mansbach and Keck, 1969; Robicheaux, 2006), dissocia-
tive recombination of H+
3 (Kokoouline and Greene, 2003;
Kokoouline et al., 2001; Petrignani et al., 2011); plasma
physics(Zhdanov, 2002); and in cold chemistry(Hall and
Willitsch, 2012; H¨arter and Denschlag, 2014; H¨arter
et al., 2012; H¨arter et al., 2013; Kr¨ukow et al., 2016;
Willitsch, 2012; Willitsch et al., 2008). Some of these
characteristic and fundamental processes in chemical
physics will be reviewed from a few-body perspective in
the present section, in particular, those involving three-
body processes, such as three-body recombination and
dissociative recombination.
Special emphasis will be
given to universality in three-body recombination pro-
cesses which are relevant to hybrid trap experiments.

Three-body processes can be viewed as a chemical re-
action that converts three free atoms (or molecules or
other particles) into diatomic molecules in the absence
of external ﬁelds, i.e. the reaction A + A + A → A2 +
A. One of the very ﬁrst theoretical treatments of this re-
action was developed by Keck (Keck, 1960, 1967) using
a variational principle following a very early approach
proposed by Wigner (Wigner, 1937).
In particular, an
upper bound for the three-body recombination rate was
computed by dividing Regions of phase-space by a trial
surface that acts as the boundary between reactants and
products; this is now denoted the phase-space theory of
reaction rates. Almost in parallel, Smith developed a
more microscopic treatment for three-body recombina-
tion (Smith, 1962), and later (Shui et al., 1970) extended
the previous theory of Keck, applying this theory to the
recombination of nitrogen (Shui et al., 1970). An ap-
plication to the recombination of hydrogen (Shui, 1972,
1973) found fair agreement with the fairly crude early
experiments.

The phase-space theory of reaction rates was intro-
duced by Keck (Keck, 1960) and an alternative was pre-
sented by Smith (Smith, 1962). Next, the mathematical

49

foundations of a recent approach to calculation of clas-
sical three-body recombination rates are presented, af-
ter which applications to diﬀerent systems involving neu-
trals as well as charged particles will be reviewed. Clas-
sical trajectory calculations in hyperspherical approach
have been employed to derive diﬀerent classical Newto-
nian threshold laws, which are reviewed here, with special
emphasis on their universality. The quantum nature of
few-body physics in chemical systems will be considered
at the end, where the recombination of hydrogen atoms
and the dissociative recombination of H+
3 are covered, as
fundamental benchmark systems in chemical physics.

1. General classical treatment of few-body collisions

Classically, a two-body collision is envisioned as one
particle with a deﬁnite momentum moving towards a
scattering center. The cross section is deﬁned as an
eﬀective area on the plane perpendicular to the initial
momentum of the incoming particle which contains the
scattering center (Levine and Bernstein, 1987). In classi-
cal mechanics, the scattering cross section is determined
in terms of the scattering probability for a given value
of the impact parameter b. Recall that b is deﬁned as
the component of the position vector which is perpendic-
ular to the momentum vector of the incoming particle at
inﬁnite distance.

The concept of a two-body collision cross section is
readily generalized to an arbitrary number (n) of dimen-
sions. In particular, the cross section is deﬁned as the
eﬀective scattering area of the n − 1 hyperplane perpen-
dicular to the initial momentum of the incoming particle,
for a given impact parameter b and initial momentum P0

σprocess(P0) =

(cid:90)

℘process(b, P0)dn−1b.

(82)

Here, the opacity function, ℘process(b, P0) is the proba-
bility that a trajectory with particular initial conditions
leads to the collisional process under investigation, e.g.,
an inelastic collision, or formation of a particular prod-
uct, etc.

The classical dynamics of few-body system can be ob-
tained by recasting the degrees of freedom of the sys-
tem at hand d as a two-body collision in a d-dimensional
space, as shown in Fig. (25). This ﬁgure represents the
usual case where the center of mass motion is decoupled
from the relative motion of the interacting particles. In
this picture the three-body recombination cross section
is written

cal momenta conjugate to ρ1, ρ2 and ρCM , respectively.
Finally, the relative Hamiltonian is

the coordinates (ρ, P ) and (ρbare, Pbare) deﬁnes a canon-
ical transformation(Landau and Lifshitz, 1976; Maslov
and Fedoriuk, 1981; Whittaker, 1937), and hence both
sets of coordinates will describe the same phase-space
volume. In other words, the scattering observables will
be the same for either of these sets of coordinates, as one
would expect. The 6D position vector ρ or ρbare links the
three-body problem in 3D and the single particle problem
in 6D, as is schematically presented in Fig.(26).

In the present approach the mass-weighted 6D vector
position ρ will be employed, in a minor diﬀerence from
the conventions utilized in Ref. (P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014).

The initial vector position |ρ0| = R is chosen in the
asymptotic region where the interaction potential is neg-
ligible, thus the initial momentum satisﬁes E = P 2
0 /2µ,
where E is the incident collision kinetic energy. The hy-
perangles αP

ated subject to the constrained magnitude of the impact
parameter | ˜b|. The random distribution of those angles
must of course be chosen consistent with their appropri-
ate probability density function (P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014).

Figure 26 (Color online) Schematic representation of the
method developed for treating three-body collisions. We start
with the description of the initial conditions in the 6-D space
associated to the three-body problem at hand. Then, as in-
dicated in Step I, the initial conditions are transformed into
the coordinates associated with the three-body problem in
the usual 3D space. Step II represents the solution of the
Hamilton’s equations of motion in the 3D space. Finally, by
means of step III, the results are transformed back into the
6D space, where the cross section is calculated.

Now that the position and the momentum vectors have
been deﬁned in this 6D space, the concept of impact
parameter as the projection of the position vector onto
a hyperplane perpendicular to the initial momentum is
clear. We now implement hyperspherical coordinates for
the representation of the 6D vectors. In particular, it is
convenient to implement Avery’s deﬁnition of the hyper-
angles (Avery, 1989) is chosen, where all the vectors can
be represented by means of their magnitude r and ﬁve

3. Classical three-body recombination for neutrals and
ion-neutral-neutral systems

The hyperspherical classical trajectory method (P´erez-
R´ıos and Greene, 2015; P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014) has been
applied to the recombination of three neutrals and to the
ion-neutral-neutral recombination process. For a given
collision energy Ek = P 2
0 /2µ, the average classical three-
body cross section is given by

represents the opacity function or reaction probability for
three-body recombination, that is, the probability that
the reactants transform into the products of interest for
a given set of initial conditions and impact parameter.
Generally, such a probability shows a stereochemical de-
pendence, but the hyperangular degrees of freedom can
be averaged out, leading to

This integral is evaluated by Monte Carlo sampling Over
the diﬀerent initial conditions and impact parameters.
The sampling is performed by means of the probability
distribution function in each degree of freedom, which
can be laborious but is trivially parallelizable. The so-
lution for ℘rec(b, P0) in Eq. (99) implies the maximum
impact parameter that can produce a recombination pro-
cess for a ﬁxed P0, denoted as bmax(P0). In other words,
℘rec(b, P0) = 0 for b > bmax(P0). Finally, the three-body
recombination cross section can be expressed as

transformed into the usual 3D space by means of Eqs.(88)
and (90), where Hamilton’s classical equations of mo-
tion are numerically integrated up to a certain ﬁnal time
(P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014; Press et al., 1986). Then the
coordinates are mapped back into the 6D space, and the
classical three-body cross section is calculated by means
of Eq.(96). This protocol is schematically presented in
Fig. (26).

The present approach has been applied to neutral
three-body recombination (P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014) and
also to neutral-neutral-ion three-body recombination
(P´erez-R´ıos and Greene, 2015). Fig.(27) exhibits diﬀer-
ent trajectories associated with recombination events in
several atomic systems: He + He + He in panel (a), Rb
+ Rb + Rb+ in panel(b) and Rb + Rb + Ba+ in panel
(c). These trajectories have been obtained by assuming a
pair-wise potential V (r1, r2, r3) = v(r12)+v(r23)+v(r31),
where rij are the interparticle distances. In particular,
for the helium atom-atom interaction the potential of
Aziz et al., designated HFD-B3-FCI1(Aziz et al., 1995)
has been employed. The 3Σ potential of (Strauss et al.,
2010) for Rb-Rb is employed, and no spin-ﬂip transi-
tions are allowed in the theoretical model. The ion-
atom interactions are described by the model potential
−αd(1−(rm/r)2)/2r4, where αd denotes the static dipole
polarizability of Rb, which is taken as αd = 320 a.u., and
rm represents the position of the minimum of the poten-
tial. For Rb+-Rb, rm is taken from the quantum chem-
istry calculations of (Jraij et al., 2003), and the informa-

The quantal results show a convergence within better than
about 15 % for E = 1000 K regarding the number of channels
included and the parameters employed in the calculations.

The results for the He-He-He classical three-body re-
combination rate are shown in Fig.(28). The quantum
mechanical results shown in Fig. (28) were obtained us-
ing the R-matrix method to solve the coupled hyperra-
dial equations in the adiabatic hyperspherical represen-
tation (Esry et al., 1996b; Lin, 1995; Wang et al., 2011a)
to obtain the scattering matrix (Aymar et al., 1996).
Fig. (28) shows that classical trajectory results for J =
0 are in reasonably good agreement with the quantal re-
sults at collision energies ∼ 1 K, which is the same order
of magnitude as the van der Waals energy: this serves
approximately as the transition energy between ultra-
cold physics and thermal physics, as was pointed out in
Ref. (P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014).

The same classical approach has been applied to the
study of ion-neutral-neutral three body recombination
at cold temperatures (Kr¨ukow et al., 2016; P´erez-R´ıos
and Greene, 2015), which is important in ion-neutral hy-
brid trap experiments. Indeed three-body recombination
reaction is the main loss mechanism for certain ionic
species immersed in an ultracold high density neutral
cloud(H¨arter and Denschlag, 2014; H¨arter et al., 2012;
H¨arter et al., 2013; Kr¨ukow et al., 2016). In particular,
87Rb+ - 87Rb - 87Rb and 138Ba+ - 87Rb - 87Rb were
studied following the hyperspherical classical approach
for collision energies ranging from 100µK up to 10 mK,
and the results are shown in Fig.(29).

The classical trajectory results presented in panels (a)
and (b) of Fig.(29) have been obtained by restricting one

of the hyperangles associated with the momentum, guar-
anteeing that 95 % of the collision energy goes along the
vector joining the ion and the center of mass of the neu-
trals. This dynamical constraint is a consequence of the
typical experimental conditions: the energy of the ion
is typically orders of magnitude higher than the energy
of the neutrals (H¨arter and Denschlag, 2014; Willitsch,
2012; Willitsch et al., 2008) because of the trapped ion
micromotion. As for the trajectories shown in Fig.(27),
the same assumptions about the potential energy land-
scape and the same potentials were employed. In panels
(a) and (b) of Fig.(29), the three-body recombination
rate versus collision energy shows a power law depen-
dence. The physics behind this numerical observation,
including its derivation, was explained in Ref.(P´erez-R´ıos
and Greene, 2015), and is summarized below.

4. Classical threshold law for three-body recombination:
universality in cold chemistry

In quantum mechanics the existence of threshold laws
for elastic and inelastic collisions are familiar: the well-
known Wigner threshold laws. These threshold laws rep-
resent the general trend of the cross section for diﬀerent
processes (here, elastic and inelastic collisions) as func-

tions of the collision energy. Analogously, there are also
classical threshold laws, such as the famous Langevin
cross section (Langevin, 1905) which establishes the be-
havior of the cross section at low collision energies for
two-body ion-neutral collisions. Several years after that,
Wannier found the classical threshold law for three-body
collisions involving charged particles (Wannier, 1953),
implementing a diﬀerent approach than Langevin devel-

particles, e.g.
two negative electrons escaping from a
positive ion, the exponent in the energy-dependent rate
constant is an irrational number which has been experi-
mentally conﬁrmed by measuring the double photoioniza-
tion of He (Kossmann et al., 1988; Van der Wiel, 1972).
The unusual threshold law exponent 1.127... was also
veriﬁed experimentally for the escape of two electrons
from a singly-charged positive ion, as was discussed above
in Sec.I
(Cvejanovic and Read, 1974; Donahue et al.,
1982). More recently, the classical threshold law for
three-body recombination involving neutrals with domi-
nant long range van der Waals attraction, as well as for
two neutrals and a single ion, have been obtained (P´erez-
R´ıos and Greene, 2015; P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014) following
a classical capture model (Levine and Bernstein, 1987).
At low collision energies the scattering properties are
mainly dominated by the long-range tail of the two-
body interaction, which here are represented as V (R) →
−Cs/Rs, with s > 2. We deﬁne the maximum impact
parameter ˜bmax as the distance where the interaction po-
tential is equal to the collision energy, i.e.

Thus, the neutral three-body recombination rate con-
stant at low collision energies should vary with energy
in proportion to k3(Ek) ∝ E1/3
(P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014).
k
Fig. (28) displays a numerical calculation of the three-
body recombination rate coeﬃcient for helium, showing
that at low collision energies k3(Ek) follows a power law
dependence as a function of Ek. A ﬁt of the classi-
cal trajectory results to the functional form (k3(Ek) =
aEb
k) gives the dashed-purple line. The ﬁtting param-
eters obtained are a=(5.89±3.145 × 10−31) cm6/s and
b = −0.26 ± 0.07, which is consistent with the predicted
k3(Ek) ∝ E−1/3

behavior (P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014).

The preceding derivation has assumed that all of the
two-body interactions share identical long-range behav-
ior, but an important case to consider is when diﬀerent
particle pairs have diﬀerent interactions. This case has
been explored in the context of determining the thresh-
old law for ion-neutral-neutral three-body recombina-
tion (P´erez-R´ıos and Greene, 2015). For that system,
the two neutral atoms interact through a long-range van
der Waals potential V (R) = −C6/R6, whereas the two
ion-neutral interaction is dominated by the charge in-
duced dipole interaction V (R) = −αd/2R4. A classical
capture model can be employed in analogy to the neutral
three-body recombination derivation , but in this case the
capture radius is given by

E =

˜bs

.

(102)

E =

(105)

This denotes the distance where the motion of the col-
liding particles starts to deviate from the rectilinear uni-
form trajectory. This distance is the equivalent to the
classical capture radius employed for the derivation of
the Langevin cross section (Langevin, 1905; Levine and
Bernstein, 1987), but assuming V (R) = −αd/2R4 in that
case. In analogy with the classical capture model, it is
assumed that all the trajectories with ˜b ≤ ˜bmax will lead
to a three-body recombination event, which of course is
likely to be an overestimate. The three-body recombina-
tion cross section can then be expressed as the following
(by virtue of Eq. (98) )

Here it has been assumed that the longer-range attrac-

and Greene, 2015):

Ion-neutral-neutral collisions play an important role in

Ef MM is shown as solid symbols in Fig. (30). In the same
ﬁgure the open symbols stand for the classical trajec-
tory results computed using hyperspherical coordinates
(P´erez-R´ıos et al., 2014). The theoretical three-body re-
combination rate constant presented in Fig. (30) is cal-
culated by using the realistic energy distribution of the
ion by means of a Monte Carlo simulation (Kr¨ukow et al.,
2016). Fig. (30) show a good agreement between the clas-
sical trajectory calculations in and the experimental re-
sults, conﬁrming on one hand the validity of the classical
Newtonian treatment in cold chemistry, and on the other
hand, supporting the classical threshold law, Eq. (107).
Apart from the conﬁrmation of the threshold law, this
also has important implications in the chemistry that oc-
curs after a three-body recombination event in a hybrid
trap experiment, since the classical results suggest that
the dominant product channel will be the formation of
shallow molecular ions (Kr¨ukow et al., 2016; P´erez-R´ıos
and Greene, 2015).
In fact our estimates suggest that
classical mechanics should give a reasonable description
of the three-body recombination process for Ba+-Rb-Rb
down to energies of the order of 100-200nK.

exploring the multi-faceted aspects of this ﬁeld and its
interconnections with nuclear physics, chemical physics,
and ultracold atomic and molecular physics is encour-
aged to explore the broader literature, and a good start
would be the following set of review articles:
(Baranov
et al., 2012; Blume, 2012a; Braaten and Hammer, 2006;
Frederico et al., 2012; Jensen et al., 2004b; Lin, 1995;
Naidon and Endo, 2016; Nielsen et al., 2001; Petrov,
2012; Rittenhouse et al., 2011b; Sadeghpour et al., 2000;
Wang et al., 2013, 2015a; Zinner and Jensen, 2013). The
ability to control interparticle interactions through Fano-
Feshbach resonances or conﬁnement-induced resonances
continues to trigger novel experimental eﬀorts, and the-
oretical progress on many fronts continues to be rapid as
well. This ﬁeld promises to continue stimulating new sur-
prises in few-body and many-body physics in the years
ahead. Here is one wish list for desirable development of
improved understanding in several areas:

• (1) Further insights into the extent of universal-
ity for heavy-heavy-light systems with short-range
interactions, including the role of van der Waals
forces and the dependence on all parameters in-
cluding the mass ratio.

• (2) Detailed theory and experiment to map out
the universality of three-particle systems with all
masses diﬀerent, including of course the possible
role of van der Waals universality.

• (3) Determination of N -body cluster states and re-
combination rates for both homonuclear and het-
eronuclear systems, with N > 3. There is a large
parameter space to explore here, just for N = 4,
for instance.

• (4) Controlled applications of external electromag-
netic ﬁeld dressing of the few-body systems to sup-
press or enhance inelastic processes. Progress in

recombination processes.

• (5) Further development of experiments and theory

for mixed-dimension few-body systems.

• (6) Experimental observation of log-periodic energy
dependence of three-body recombination, which has
been predicted to be visible for very large scattering
lengths.

• (7) In the BCS-BEC crossover problem with a
Fermi gas having more than two spin components,
it will be interesting to see whether macroscopic
collapse of the gas is possible when the interaction
scattering lengths are negative, as was predicted
by (Blume et al., 2008; Rittenhouse and Greene,
2008).

• (8) The three-body and four-body systems with
strong electric and/or magnetic dipolar interac-
tions has received some theoretical attention(Wang
et al., 2011b,c) but little in the way of experimen-
tal tests to date, and in view of extensive cur-
rent interest in polar molecule quantum gases, or
strong magnetic dipolar atomic condensates and
Fermi gases, far more work is needed from both per-
spectives.(Baranov et al., 2012; Kotochigova, 2014;
Wang et al., 2015a; Zinner and Jensen, 2013)

• (9) It should be kept in mind that an accurate de-
scription of the two-body scattering length depen-
dence of few-body phenomena hinges critically on
having an accurate description of the atom-atom
scattering lengths as functions of static and/or os-
cillating electromagnetic ﬁelds. Theory has im-
proved to the point where a number of alterna-
tive techniques can provide this data, when de-
veloped in conjunction with experiments, includ-
ing full close-coupling calculations (CC) (Berninger
et al., 2013), the asymptotic bound state model
(ABM )(Tiecke et al., 2010), and variants of multi-
channel quantum defect theory (MQDT) with or
without the additional frame transformation ap-
proximation (MQDT-FT) (Burke et al., 1998; Gao,
2008; Ruzic et al., 2013). Ref.(Pires et al., 2014a)
and references therein provide comparisons of these
diﬀerent treatments, with application to the re-
cently important heteronuclear system 6Li−133Cs.
While these theoretical descriptions have been gen-
erally successful, extensions and improvements are
still desirable in order to gain the fullest possible
control of the two-body physics underlying all of
the few-body physics addressed in this review.

• (10) Further insights are also desired for systems
such as the few-body version of the fractional quan-
tum Hall problem, both in condensed matter sys-

56

tems and in ultracold atomic systems. Initial stud-
ies by (Daily et al., 2015b; Rittenhouse et al., 2016;
Wooten et al., 2016) into that subject from the adi-
abatic hyperspherical perspective suggest that the
corresponding 2D N -particle Schr¨odinger equation
nearly separates in the hyperradial degree of free-
dom, both for bosons and fermions, as can be de-
duced from potential energy curves in those refer-
ences. Moreover, some of the intriguing degeneracy
patterns observed in that problem are deserving of
further exploration.
