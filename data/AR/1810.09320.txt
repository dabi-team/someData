ABSTRACT

The X8.2 event of 10 September 2017 provides unique observations to study the genesis, magnetic morphology and
impulsive dynamics of a very fast CME. Combining GOES-16/SUVI and SDO/AIA EUV imagery, we identify a hot
(T ≈ 10 − 15 MK) bright rim around a quickly expanding cavity, embedded inside a much larger CME shell (T ≈ 1 − 2
MK). The CME shell develops from a dense set of large AR loops ((cid:38)0.5 Rs), and seamlessly evolves into the CME
front observed in LASCO C2. The strong lateral overexpansion of the CME shell acts as a piston initiating the fast
EUV wave. The hot cavity rim is demonstrated to be a manifestation of the dominantly poloidal ﬂux and frozen-in
plasma added to the rising ﬂux rope by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath. The same structure
is later observed as the core of the white light CME, challenging the traditional interpretation of the CME three-
part morphology. The large amount of added magnetic ﬂux suggested by these observations explains the extreme
accelerations of the radial and lateral expansion of the CME shell and cavity, all reaching values of 5–10 km s−2. The
acceleration peaks occur simultaneously with the ﬁrst RHESSI 100–300 keV hard X-ray burst of the associated ﬂare,
further underlining the importance of the reconnection process for the impulsive CME evolution. Finally, the much
higher radial propagation speed of the ﬂux rope in relation to the CME shell causes a distinct deformation of the white
light CME front and shock.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale structures of magnetized plasma that are expelled from the Sun with
speeds ranging from some 100 up to about 3500 km s−1 (St. Cyr et al. 1999; Gopalswamy et al. 2009), driven by
magnetic forces (e.g. reviews by Forbes et al. 2006; Chen & Wu 2011; Green et al. 2018). They are the most energetic
events in our solar system, being associated with energy releases of up to some 1032 erg (Vourlidas et al. 2010; Emslie
et al. 2012). Fast CMEs are often associated with EUV waves, which are widely believed to be low-coronal signatures
of large-amplitude fast-mode magnetosonic waves or shocks (e.g. reviews by Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2012; Liu &
Ofman 2014; Warmuth 2015; Long et al. 2017). When the interplanetary counterpart of a CME, the ICME, and its
associated shock reaches Earth, they may induce strong geomagnetic storms, with the storm strength mainly depending
on the southward (Bz) component of the ICME’s magnetic ﬁeld and on its impact speed (Tsurutani et al. 1988, 1992;
Gonzalez et al. 1994). Recent studies, in particular owing to the multi-spacecraft in-situ observations of the STEREO
satellites, revealed the production of wide-spread solar energetic particles (SEPs), which seem to be able to ﬁll the

extreme cases of wide-spread SEP events are either related to speciﬁc properties of the CME and its associated shock
close to the Sun (extended source region) and/or to perpendicular particle transport processes in interplanetary space
(e.g. Dresing et al. 2014). Thus, the understanding of the origin and early evolution of CMEs close to the Sun, their
interplanetary propagation as well as their interaction processes with the Earth magnetosphere are all key aspects in
the understanding and prediction of extreme space weather events (e.g. Koskinen et al. 2017).

CMEs observed in white-light coronagraphs often reveal a three-part structure: a leading bright front followed by a
dark cavity (void) and an embedded bright core (Illing & Hundhausen 1986). The bright front is a shell of enhanced
density, due to compressed and piled-up material ahead of the erupting structure. The dark cavity and the bright core
are generally interpreted as manifestions of a magnetic ﬂux rope, i.e. a coherent helical magnetic structure with the
ﬁeld lines wrapping around the central axis (e.g., Low & Hundhausen 1995). The ﬂux rope may ﬁll the whole volume
of the dark coronal cavity, and thus the cavity may outline the ﬂux rope’s cross-section in the plane-of-sky (Chen et al.
1997; see also the review by Cheng et al. 2017). The bright core is usually interpreted as corresponding to the cool and
dense prominence material that is suspended in the magnetic dips at the bottom of the twisted ﬂux rope (e.g., Dere
et al. 1999; Gibson et al. 2006). However, Howard et al. (2017) challenged this view, suggesting that the bright core
represents the erupting ﬂux rope with prominence material contributing to the emission only in a minority of events.
Vourlidas et al. (2013) pointed out that the CME front in the classical three-part structure may actually reveal a
“two-front” morphology. The bright loop-like front observed in the coronagraphs corresponds to the piled-up materal
ahead of the erupting structure. In addition, also a fainter outer front may be visible in the white-light coronagraph
images (ﬁrst reported in Vourlidas et al. (2003), and reported in a number of events thereafter) as a result of the
density enhancement by the shock that is driven by quickly accelerating CMEs.

Recently, the early evolution of CMEs, their ﬂux ropes and cavities in the inner corona have become accessible in the
high-cadence multi-band EUV observations from STEREO EUVI and SDO AIA. This is an important height range,
where many CMEs appear to form and to undergo their impulsive acceleration phase (Temmer et al. 2010; Bein et al.
2011; Patsourakos et al. 2010a,b; Cheng et al. 2011). Several studies have shown that hot ﬂux ropes may be enclosed
in a dark cavity observed in cool EUV passbands, showing plasma at typical quiet coronal temperatures (Cheng et al.
2011, 2013; Zhang et al. 2012). A statistical study of eruptions observed in the EUV by Nindos et al. (2015) revealed
that about half of the events exhibit a hot ﬂux rope.

In general, CMEs observed in the coronagraph ﬁeld-of-view (i.e. beyond several solar radii) reveal a self-similar
expansion, i.e. the radial and lateral expansion develop at the same rate (Schwenn et al. 2005). Recent studies of CME
and cavity evolution in high-cadence EUV imagery report fast lateral overexpansion of CMEs low in the corona, i.e.
the radius (width) of the CME expands stronger than it gains in height (Patsourakos et al. 2010a,b; Cheng et al. 2013).
Further, fast lateral CME expansion has been shown to be important for the formation of EUV waves and shocks low
in the corona (e.g. Veronig et al. 2008; Temmer et al. 2009; Patsourakos et al. 2010a; Veronig et al. 2010; Cheng et al.
2012).

In this paper, we present a case study of the origin and early evolution of the fast CME that occurred together with
the X8.2 ﬂare on 10 September 2017, and its associated EUV wave. The event was the second largest ﬂare in solar
cycle 24, and extreme in several aspects. It was associated with a very fast halo CME with a speed (cid:38) 3500 km s−1
(Guo et al. 2018; Gopalswamy et al. 2018), and revealed distinct signatures of a long hot current sheet that formed
behind the erupting structure (Seaton & Darnel 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Warren et al. 2018). The event produced

wide-spread SEPs detected at Earth, Mars and STEREO-A, i.e. covering a width of at least 230◦ in helio-longitude.
Notably, this SEP event was the ﬁrst Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) that was observed on the surface of two
planets, Earth and Mars (Guo et al. 2018). Fermi-LAT observed an extremely long duration γ-ray event, detecting
>100 MeV emission from the ﬂare that lasted for more than 12 hours (Omodei et al. 2018). The associated EUV
wave was also unique, as it was globally propagating across the full solar disk as observed from Earth view as well as
from STEREO-A, and showed transmission through both polar coronal holes (Liu et al. 2018; Podladchikova et al.,
in preparation). Some further aspects of this intriguing event that have been studied are the formation and turbulent
plasma motions in the current sheet (Li et al. 2018; Warren et al. 2018), the evolution of the ﬂux rope, its cavity and
reconnection signatures (Seaton & Darnel 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Long et al. 2018), the coronal plasma properties in
the aftermath of the CME (Goryaev et al. 2018), the microwave and hard X-ray ﬂare emission (Gary et al. 2018), the
shock properties near the Sun and the characteristics of the shock-accelerated particles (Gopalswamy et al. 2018) as
well as the the coronal-to-interplanetary CME evolution and associated wide shock (Guo et al. 2018).

We concentrate on the genesis, morphology and impulsive dynamics of the CME in the low-to-mid corona, as well
as on its relation to the formation of the associated fast EUV wave. Very valuable observations on these phenomena
are provided by the new Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI; Seaton & Darnel 2018) on board GOES-16. SUVI observes
the solar EUV corona over a large ﬁeld-of-view (FOV), allowing us to robustly connect CME structures in subsequent
images without change of instrument/emission processes, and with a cadence high enough to resolve the dynamical
processes during the impulsive CME phase. These data are complemented by the high-cadence multi-band EUV
imagery of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), to study the impulsive evolution of the CME cavity and ﬂux rope low in the corona. As
we will demonstrate in this paper, the event under study provides us also with unique observations of the three-part
CME structure from the EUV to the white-light coronagraph data, and new insights into its physical interpretation.

2. DATA

The SUVI instrument on board of the GOES-16 spacecraft images the solar corona in six EUV passbands, centered
at 94, 131, 171, 195, 284, and 304 ˚A, with a large FOV, out to >1.6 Rs in the horizontal direction and as large as
2.3 Rs in the unvignetted corners (Seaton & Darnel 2018), with Rs denoting the solar radius. The pixel scale of the
SUVI ﬁltergrams is 2.5 arcsec. SUVI’s camera is equipped with an anti-blooming circuitry, which enables unobscured
observations of the ﬂare regions even in exposures where the detecor is substantially saturated, while at the same time
providing high sensitivity to observe faint structures (e.g., EUV waves). The AIA instrument onboard SDO observes
the solar EUV corona in seven wavelength bands, centered at 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335, and 304 ˚A, with a cadence
as high as 12 s, a pixel scale of 0.6 arcsec and over a FOV of about 1.3 Rs in horizontal direction. Thus, AIA and
SUVI both sample solar plasmas over a broad temperature range of about 105 to 107 K.

The X8.2 event of 10 September 2017 occurred when the source active region NOAA 12673 was on the Western limb
(ﬂare start/peak time: 15:35/16:08 UT; heliographic coordinates: S08W88). SUVI and AIA observed the ﬂare, the
CME initiation and evolution in the low-to-mid corona as well as the associated EUV wave. We use the SUVI 195 ˚A
ﬁlter observations available with a mean cadence of 1 min to study the impulsive radial and lateral expansion of the
CME shell as well as the associated EUV wave. To enhance the structures in the images, in particular above the limb,
we use the same ﬁltering technique as in Seaton & Darnel (2018). This is a two-step ﬁltering consisting of a varying
radial ﬁlter (to account for the coronal intensity fall oﬀ in the corona) and a temporal unsharp masking technique (to
enhance changes in time). The image series was compensated for solar diﬀerential rotation, and base diﬀerence images
were created. In addition, we use the multi-wavelength SUVI imagery to study the radial kinematics of the ﬂux rope
and cavity (Seaton & Darnel 2018). Note that we did not rotate the SUVI images to North up, in order to keep the
full FOV that SUVI provides; the solar P0 angle of the day was +23.1◦.

The SUVI data are complemented by the multi-temperature EUV imagery from the AIA instrument onboard SDO,
to study the radial and lateral expansion of the distinct cavity observed low in the corona (Long et al. 2018). Each AIA
image has been processed using the Multi-scale Gaussian Normalization technique of Morgan & Druckm¨uller (2014)
to highlight the ﬁne structures above the limb. Data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO;
Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are used to set the CME shell and
cavity observed in the EUV into context with the white-light CME observed further out by the LASCO C2 and C3
coronagraphs. The time line of the associated ﬂare is studied in the GOES soft X-ray (SXR) and Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) hard X-ray (HXR) data.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Event overview

Figure 1 and the accompanying movie give an overview of the early CME evolution and the formation of the EUV
wave as observed in SUVI 195 ˚A direct images and corresponding base diﬀerence images. In the movie, we can clearly
see the expansion of the large pre-existing loop system that develops into the CME shell as well as the development of
the associated EUV wave. We note that the pre-eruptive structure of the source AR 12673 is very distinct, consisting
of a dense set of very large loops, with sizes up to >0.5 Rs. These are a result of the extremely strong ﬁelds of >5000
G that have been measured in AR 12673 (Wang et al. 2018).
In the movie, it is seen that the ﬁrst motions and
re-conﬁgurations related to the event can be observed as early as 15:39 UT, including the rise of a low-lying, already
brightened prominence. During its rise, the prominence appears to dissolve and the eruption develops an inner ﬂux
rope structure with a clear cavity that is quickly expanding (see also Long et al. 2018; Seaton & Darnel 2018; Yan
et al. 2018).

More detail of the CME formation and its early evolution can be seen in Figure 2 and the associated movie, which
shows a zoom to the eruption region in six of the AIA EUV passbands. In the hot AIA 94 ˚A channel (dominated
by emission from an Fe xviii line; peak formation temperature T ≈ 7 MK), the cavity is observed earliest and also
some embedded prominence material can be observed. The cavity becomes more pronounced during its fast rise and
expansion. It appears dark in all AIA channels, indicative of a strong density depletion inside the cavity due to the
enhanced magnetic pressure of the enclosed ﬂux rope (e.g. Gibson 2015), and is surrounded by a distinct bright rim
that can be seen in all AIA EUV passbands. Throughout the eruption, the bright rim is most distinct in the AIA 131
˚A ﬁlter (Fe viii and xxi), sampling plasmas at temperatures (cid:38) 10 MK. This suggests that the bright rim around
the cavity may be a manifestation of the magnetic ﬂux and frozen-in plasma that is fed to the erupting ﬂux rope by
the magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath, and that, hence, the hot cavity rim outlines the cross-section
of the enclosed expanding ﬂux rope (as the simulations by Lin et al. (2004) suggest). This interpretation is further
supported by the thin elongated structure that connects the bottom of the hot rim around the cavity to the top of
the rising ﬂare loop system, most clearly observed in the AIA 131 ˚A ﬁlter (see Figure 2 and associated movie). This
structure has been interpreted as an observational signature of the hot plasma around the current sheet that is formed
behind the eruption (Seaton & Darnel 2018; Yan et al. 2018; Warren et al. 2018). At later stages ((cid:38)16:00 UT) after
the cavity has already exited the AIA FOV, the elongated current sheet appears well pronounced in all the AIA EUV
channels. As shown in Warren et al. (2018), the temperature in the current sheet is about 20 MK, with a relatively
narrow distribution. The observed sheet thickness is about 3000 km (Yan et al. 2018).

At the very start of the event, during 15:39–15:51 UT, hot loops are seen to reconnect and to form new conﬁgurations,
as revealed in the AIA 131 and 94 ˚A images in Figure 2 and the associated movie. We can see changes in diﬀerent ﬂux
systems connecting to the top of the ﬂux rope structure. These changes are observed immediately before the cavity
and bright rim are clearly formed, and seem to be the trigger for the fast eruption.

The EUV wave associated with this event is distinctly seen above the solar limb as well on the solar disk (Figure 1
and associated movie; see also Seaton & Darnel (2018); Liu et al. (2018)). In the SUVI frame at 15:52:24 UT, we can
identify the wave for the ﬁrst time, as it is formed ahead of the CME ﬂanks expanding toward the North (indicated
by an arrow in Figure 1). In this Northern direction, the EUV wave appears as a sharp front above the limb growing
to a large extension in height, up to the borders of the SUVI ﬁeld-of-view (FOV). Toward the South, the formation
and detachment of the wave from the CME ﬂanks is not as distinct as toward the North, but after about 15:58 UT
also here the EUV wave can be observed ahead of the CME shell in its propagation above the limb. On the disk,
the EUV wave can be ﬁrst identiﬁed in the SUVI frame at 15:54:24 UT. Surprisingly, despite the strength and global
propagation of this EUV wave, inspection of GONG Hα image series did not reveal any signature of an associated
Moreton wave.

The base diﬀerence images in Figure 1 reveal a large coronal dimming above the limb, consisting of diﬀerent parts
signifying diﬀerent magnetic domains and physical phenomena. The main dimming is associated with the CME
eruption, as it is laterally well conﬁned to within the expanding CME bubble. This is the coronal dimming due to the
expansion and evacuation of mass by the erupting CME (e.g. Hudson et al. 1997; Zarro et al. 1999; Dissauer et al.
2018). The other dimming regions above the limb, further apart from the eruption center both in the North and South
directions, are more shallow and are trailing the propagating EUV wave front. These ﬁndings suggest that they are
signatures of the rarefaction region that forms behind the compression front of the wave (Muhr et al. 2011; Luli´c et al.

P0 angle of +23.1◦.

2013; Vrˇsnak et al. 2016). The movie also reveals a number of interactions of the EUV wave with plasma structures
in the corona, such as reﬂections, refractions and most interestingly also the transmission through the polar coronal
holes. These interactions and wave kinematics are studied in Liu et al. (2018) and Podladchikova et al. (2018, in
preparation).

3.2. Early dynamics of the eruption

The event of 10 September 2017 provides us with an excellent opportunity to study the early impulsive dynamics
of both the CME shell and the embedded ﬂux rope/cavity in a very fast eruption. This is owed to the clearly formed
and well separated structures in this event captured by the high-cadence and large FOV observations of the AIA and
SUVI EUV imagers, respectively. Both phenomena are important to study, to better understand the origin of the
eruption and its consequences. The ﬂux rope represents a current carrying structure that provides the forces driving
the rise and expansion of the CME bubble. The dark EUV cavity that we observe is interpreted to map the ﬂux rope’s
cross-section, as is further discussed in Sect. 3.2.2. The CME shell represents the outermost layer of compressed and
piled-up material moving through the corona and interplanetary space. It also acts as the contact surface that creates
shock waves ahead of it.

Figure 1 and the associated movie show that following the early rise of the ﬂux rope/cavity, the large pre-existing
set of loops observed in the SUVI 195 ˚A ﬁltergrams also start to rise and to expand by successively piling up higher
overlying sets of loops. It is also seen that the lateral expansion of this forming CME shell is more pronounced than the
radial one, leading to a distinct lateral overexpansion. In Figure 3, we show composite images from the SOHO/LASCO
C2 coronagraph and co-temporal SUVI 195 ˚A ﬁltergrams for the ﬁrst two time steps where the CME entered the C2
FOV. The composite at 16:00 UT clearly shows that the outer boundary of the loop structures that we see expanding
in the SUVI 195 ˚A images seamlessly ﬁts to the CME front observed in the white-light coronagraph data. In the
Northern direction, also some fainter outer emission region in C2 is seen, which appears to connect to the EUV wave
front observed in SUVI that is already well separated from the CME shell at that time. This indicates that this faint

outer emission region in C2 is an early signature of the CME shock wave observed in white-light (cf., Vourlidas et al.
2003). Finally, in the C2 image at 16:12 UT a bright core is seen, indicative of the embedded ﬂux rope.

3.2.1. Early dynamics of the CME shell

In order to quantify the impulsive radial and lateral expansion of the CME shell in the SUVI FOV, we segment
its structure and follow its evolution. At each time step, a binary map is constructed by thresholding, using the
2% brightest pixels in the SUVI 195 ˚A base diﬀerence images. Figure 4a shows an example binary map derived,
where all the white pixels are assumed to belong to the CME bubble. However, this segmentation includes also pixels
without connection to the CME bubble, and these are subsequently removed by median-ﬁltering (Figure 4b). From
this segmentation, we then determine the outer border of the CME structure and its (x, y) coordinates as shown
by the red contour in Figure 4c. Finally, missing parts of the border are determined by interpolation of the (x, y)
coordinates on the basis of minimization of the second derivative of the curve describing the border (Figure 4d). Note
that with this approach we are able to automatically detect the outer envelope of the set of expanding EUV loops
that is subsequently developing into the white-light CME (cf. Figure 3). Applying the segmentations on the SUVI
base diﬀerence images implies that we identify those regions which are increasing in emission due to expansion and
subsequent pile-up of overlying loops, and thus becoming part of the overall erupting structure.

Figure 5 shows the results of this segmentation procedure for all SUVI 195 ˚A images during 15:49–15:57 UT. As can
be seen from the determined borders, the shape of the CME structure transforms from roundish to an ellipse, indicative
of a strong lateral overexpansion during its evolution. We also note that the segmentation algorithm correctly handles
the loop system along the northern boundary, which is observed as a sharp, slightly-curved radial structure. It exists
already before the event, and the algorithm correctly identiﬁes it as not being part of the CME shell. However, when
the pre-existing loop structure expands to form the CME, also the overlying loops are piled up and eventually become
part of the CME shell. For the loop structure toward the North, this change is correctly identiﬁed between time steps
15:54 UT (where it is identiﬁed as an external structure, i.e. not part of the CME) and 15:55 UT (where it became
integrated to the expanding CME shell).

Based on the CME segmentations at each time step, we trace its outward propagation along the radial direction from
Sun center to the center of the CME structure. The height of the CME is then determined as its radial extent plus
the distance between its lower border and the solar surface. The CME lateral expansion is analyzed by constructing
the perpendicular line through the center of the segmented structure and determining the intersection points with its
borders to determine the CME width (cf. the straight lines in Figure 5). The relative errors on the derived height
and width data are estimated to be about 2%. These height and width measurements are then used to study the
kinematics and dynamics of the CME shell. To obtain robust estimates of the corresponding velocity and acceleration
proﬁles, we ﬁrst smooth the height-time (width-time) curves, and then derive the ﬁrst and second time derivatives.
The smoothing algorithm that we use for approximating the curves is based on the method described in Podladchikova
et al. (2017), extended toward non-equidistant data. The algorithm optimizes between two (intrinsically conﬂicting)

criteria in order to ﬁnd a balance between data ﬁdelity, i.e. the closeness of the approximating curve to the data,
and smoothness of the approximating curve. The data ﬁdelity is evaluated by minimizing the sum of the squared
deviations between the ﬁt and the data points, and the smoothness is evaluated by minimizing the sum of squared
second derivatives of the ﬁt curve.

Figure 6 shows the evolution of the radial and lateral expansion of the CME. In panel c, we plot the CME height
(blue) and width (red) as function of time. Panels d and e show the velocity and acceleration of the CME in radial
(height) and lateral (width) direction. In addition to the smoothed curves, we also show the velocity and acceleration
curves derived by numerical diﬀerentiation of the data points themselves. As one can see, the numerical derivatives,
which are intrinscially very sensitive to noise, are in general well aligned with the smoothed curves. Due to the fast
evolution, the changes over the mean observing cadence of 1 min are big enough, so that in this case the noise on the
direct derivatives is small. We also note that the slight “jump” in the CME lateral width evolution between 15:54 and

15:55 UT, which is due to the pile-up of the loop structure observed to the Northern boundary (as discussed above),
is well handled by the smoothing algorithm applied on the kinematic curves (cf. Figure 6c, red line). In panel f, we
plot the evolution of the CME aspect ratio r, deﬁned as the height of the center of the CME shell above the solar limb
divided by its half-width (cf. Patsourakos et al. 2010a,b). The aspect ratio is basically a measure of the opening angle
(angular width) of the CME, in the present case deﬁned from its source region on the solar limb. In panel f, we also
plot the corresponding angular width of the CME derived as W = 2 arctan(1/r). On the top panels, we plot (a) the
GOES 1–8 ˚A SXR ﬂux and (b) the RHESSI HXR count rates in four energy bands from 12 to 300 keV, indicative of
the evolution of the energy release and particle acceleration in the associated ﬂare.

As can be seen from the kinematical curves in Figure 6, the CME reveals a very fast evolution. The radial propagation
speed is continuously increasing, and reaches ∼1000 km s−1 at a distance of 0.85 Rs above the limb. Later, in the
coronagraphic FOV, the CME reached a maximum speed of (cid:38)3500 km s−1 (Guo et al. 2018; Gopalswamy et al. 2018).
The lateral CME expansion reveals a speed of ∼1600 km s−1 in the SUVI FOV, reached within 4 min of impulsive
acceleration. The acceleration curves reach their maxima both within the SUVI FOV, notably with much higher values
for the lateral expansion, 10.1 ± 1.1 km s−2 at 15:53:50 UT, while the radial peak acceleration is 5.3 ± 0.6 km s−2
at 15:54:40 UT. The diﬀerence in the radial and lateral evolution causes a fast decrease of the CME aspect ratio,
which changes from 0.96 to 0.75 within 5 min over a height range of just 0.2 Rs, corresponding to an increase of the
CME angular width from about 90 to 105◦. We note that the peaks in the lateral and radial CME acceleration occur
simultaneously within the SUVI measurement cadence of 1 min, and also simultaneous with the ﬁrst RHESSI 100–300
keV HXR burst (15:54:40 UT).

3.2.2. Cavity morphology and ﬂux rope

As discussed in Sect. 3.1, the cavity embedded inside the CME shell appears dark in all AIA EUV channels,
suggestive of a strong density depletion due to the enhanced magnetic pressure in the enclosed magnetic ﬂux rope, and
it is surrounded by a bright rim (cf. Figure 2). Throughout the eruption observed in the AIA FOV, this rim appears
most pronounced in the 131 ˚A ﬁlter, together with the hot current sheet (T ≈ 20 MK; Warren et al. 2018) beneath
which connects the hot cavity rim to the top of the rising ﬂare loop system. The high plasma temperatures in the bright
rim around the expanding cavity are conﬁrmed by the AIA Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis in Yan et al.
(2018) and from Hinode/EIS spectroscopy, which shows the rim around the expanding cavity most prominently in the
Fe xxiv spectral line (see Figure 4 in Long et al. 2018), sampling plasmas at temperatures of about 15 MK. Note that
the DEM maps shown in (Yan et al. 2018, Figure 4 therein) suggest that the thin cavity plasma embedded inside the
bright hot rim is also hot.

It is important to note that a bright rim around the cavity is observed in all AIA channels, i.e. those sampling hot
plasma at about 10 MK (131, 94 ˚A) as well as the “cooler” ﬁlters which are most sensitive to plasma at typical quiet
coronal temperatures in the range 1–2 MK (171, 193, 211 ˚A). However, there are also diﬀerences in the cavity/rim
morphology as observed in the hot and cooler ﬁlters, which have important implications. In particular, we note that
the bright rim (and enclosed cavity) have diﬀerent sizes in the diﬀerent AIA ﬁlters, appearing smallest in the hot AIA
passbands. This size diﬀerence is clearly seen in the co-temporal AIA 131 and 211 ˚A snapshots plotted in Figure 7,
where the hot bright rim observed in AIA 131 ˚A well ﬁts inside the dark cavity observed in the AIA 211 ˚A ﬁlter.

The smaller hot rim around the cavity, as most distinctly observed in the 131 ˚A ﬁlter, is strongly suggestive of
additional magnetic ﬂux that is supplied to the ﬂux rope by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath. Since
the plasma contained in this ﬂux is heated by the reconnection as it passes through the current sheet, it does not
contribute to the emission in the EUV channels sensitive to lower temperatures, so that these passbands show the
whole cross-section of the ﬂux rope as a dark cavity. These observations provide strong evidence that the distinct EUV
cavity and surrounding hot rim observed in this event outline the cross-section of the expanding ﬂux rope including
the layer of newly added ﬂux by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet.

The bright rim observed in cooler plasmas like in 211 ˚A, which has its inner boundary located at the outer boundary
of the hot rim observed in 131 ˚A (red ellipses in Figure 7; see also the movie associated with Figure 2), is most likely
formed by the compression of the plasma in the nearby overlying loops that get piled-up by the rising and expanding
ﬂux rope. This is before the corresponding ﬁeld lines also come to magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath,
and a hot rim is formed around the cavity where a cool rim was observed before.

outline the ellipses ﬁtted to the inner edge of the bright rim around the dark cavity as observed in AIA 131 (211) ˚A. The ellipse
ﬁts are from Long et al. (2018).

3.2.3. Early dynamics of the ﬂux rope/cavity

In the following, we study the dynamics of the ﬂux rope/cavity by measuring its radial and lateral expansion and
outward motion. We use the measurements of Long et al. (2018), who manually identiﬁed the inner edge of the
bright rim around the cavity separately for four diﬀerent AIA passbands, and then ﬁtted these contours by an ellipse,
extracting its minor and major axis as well as the height of its center above the limb (cf. Figure 2 therein). Here
we use the width (minor axis) and height of the cavity center derived from the AIA 211 ˚A images, as they contain
the most complete set of measurements. Note that these measurements of the kinematics of the dark cavity observed
in AIA 211 ˚A (inner edge) basically correspond to the outer boundary of the bright rim in AIA 131 ˚A (cf. Figure 7
and Sect. 3.2.2). In addition, we use the measurements of Seaton & Darnel (2018), who visually tracked the center
of the rising ﬂux rope and cavity combining all SUVI ﬁlters to derive its height evolution (cf. Figure 2 therein). The
additional value of the SUVI data is that we can follow the ﬂux rope across a larger height range than in AIA, and
thus measure its full impulsive acceleration phase.

In Figure 8, we show the results for the kinematics and dynamics of the CME cavity/ﬂux rope, using the same
methods as for the analysis of the CME shell described in Sect. 3.2.1. We plot (a) the height of the center of the
ﬂux rope/cavity and its width, (b) the derived velocity and (c) acceleration proﬁles of the cavity height and width, as
well as (d) its aspect ratio and angular width. As can be seen in panel (a), the measurements of the cavity/ﬂux rope
height from Long et al. (2018) and Seaton & Darnel (2018) are in agreement with each other despite being derived
from diﬀerent instruments and with diﬀerent methods. The radial propagation of the cavity/ﬂux rope starts with
a slow rise phase (ﬁrst measurements of Seaton & Darnel (2018) are from 15:44 UT), changing to a faster increase
around 15:51 UT. At 15:57:30 UT at a distance of 0.5 Rs above the limb (when it exits the SUVI FOV), it reaches
∼1600 km s−1, and the speed is still increasing. The width of the cavity ﬁrst reveals a slow continuous expansion,

which then quickly increases at 15:53 UT, reaching an expansion speed of ∼500 km s−1 about 2 min later when it
exits the AIA FOV; the corresponding speed of its radial motion at this time is ∼800 km s−1.

The acceleration of the lateral expansion (cavity width) reveals a maximum of 5.3 ± 1.1 km s−2 at 15:53:40 UT,
while the acceleration of the radial motion of its center reaches a peak of 6.7 ± 0.9 km s−2 at 15:55:20 UT. Notably,
the radial acceleration reveals a more continuous proﬁle, constantly increasing over about 6 min until reaching its
maximum, whereas the acceleration proﬁle of the cavity width is more impulsive with a full duration of less than 3
min. The aspect ratio (angular width) reveals a slow increase (decrease) in the early phase followed by a fast decrease
(increase) starting at 15:53:20 UT, during which the angular width of the cavity increases from 18 to 28◦ over just 2
min, indicative of a strong lateral overexpansion of the cavity during this phase.

wave fronts are marked by blue and black lines, respectively. To keep the visibility of the tracks in the stack plots, the lines are

3.3. Associated EUV wave

In order to study the formation of the associated EUV wave and its relation to the expanding CME shell, we show
in Figure 9 stack plots generated from SUVI 195 ˚A base diﬀerence images along circular slits at various distances from
Sun center, corresponding to heights of r = 0.05 to r = 0.6 Rs above the solar surface (cf. Figure 1, top right panel).
The emission is averaged over a thin circular layer covering the width of 2 SUVI pixels (corresponding to 5 arcsec)
across the considered radial distance, and then we stacked the slits obtained at diﬀerent time steps. Each stack plot in
Figure 9 shows for a certain radial distance r from Sun center, the emission enhancement with respect to a pre-event
base image as function of the polar angle ϕ (on the y-axis) and time (x-axis). The counting of ϕ starts at the left
(eastern) horizontal line of the SUVI images, and the eruption center is located at ϕ = 166◦ (indicated by the cyan
line in Figure 9).

The stack plots shown in Figure 9 clearly show the impulsive lateral expansion of the CME ﬂanks, the EUV wave
that is formed and propagating ahead of the CME ﬂanks, as well as the coronal dimmings behind. There is an obvious
asymmetry in the behaviour toward the Northern and Southern directions. Toward the North, the EUV wave front is
clearly detached from the expanding CME ﬂank and propagating ahead of it. The EUV wave is formed as early as
15:52:24 UT at heights (cid:46) 0.2 Rs above the solar limb. This is 1.5 min before the peak of the acceleration of the lateral
expansion of the CME shell, but at that time the lateral acceleration is already as high as 6 km s−2 (cf. Figure 6).
Note that this formation time of the EUV wave also well coincides with the start of the strong decrease in the aspect
ratio of the CME shell, i.e. the strong lateral overexpansion. At the time of ﬁrst EUV wave detection (15:52:24 UT),
the distance of the wave front is only 38 Mm ahead of the contact surface, i.e. the lateral outer boundary of the CME
shell. During its evolution, the distance of the wave front from the CME ﬂanks quickly increases and the wave front
grows in height, reaching up to the edge of the SUVI FOV. In the stack plots in Figure 9, the track of the propagating
wave front can be clearly identiﬁed and measured up to heights of at least 0.5 Rs above the limb. The behavior in
the Southern direction is quite diﬀerent. Here, it is only at times (cid:38)15:58 UT that the EUV wave can be distinguished
from the CME structure, and it is observed only at lower heights, up to about 0.3 Rs.

In Figure 9, we have also indicated the outer fronts of the CME ﬂank (blue lines) and the EUV wave (black lines),
the latter being used to estimate the mean speed of the EUV front at diﬀerent heights above the limb. The results
reveal an increase of the EUV wave speed with height, in the Northern direction from 750 km s−1 at 0.05 Rs to
1200 km s−1 at 0.5 Rs, with the strongest increase taking place between 0.4 and 0.5 Rs above the solar limb. In the
southern direction, we also observe a height dependence of the EUV wave speed, increasing from 750 to 950 km s−1
from 0.05 to 0.3 Rs.

4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

The X8.2 ﬂare/CME event of 10 September 2017 provides us with a unique opportunity to study the origin, mor-
phology and impulsive dynamics of a very fast eruption (v (cid:38) 3500 km s−1) as well as its relation to the fast EUV wave
formed. In the present case we can observe and measure both, the evolution of the outer CME shell and the embedded
ﬂux rope/cavity. This is thanks to the combination of the high-cadence EUV imagery of SUVI and AIA, covering
the low and middle corona, where the impulsive CME dynamics takes place. In addition, these unprecedented set of
observations reveal important implications on the three-part structure of CMEs.

4.1. Impulsive dynamics of the CME shell and cavity/ﬂux rope
The early evolution of the CME shell is well observed in the SUVI 195 ˚A ﬁltergrams. It develops from a set of very
large pre-existing loops (with sizes up to >0.5 Rs). During their expansion, successively higher overlying loops are
piled-up and become part of the erupting structure (cf. Figure 1 and associated movie, and Figure 5). Comparison
with the images by the LASCO C2 coronagraph shows that the outer front of these expanding and piled-up loops
observed in the EUV images, seamlessly matches with the CME front observed in white-light coronagraph images
(Figure 3).

The event also reveals a distinct cavity embedded in the CME shell, strongly indicative of the ﬂux rope. Magnetic
reconﬁgurations indicative of reconnection are observed early in the event (most prominently in the AIA 131 ˚A
passband), connecting the forming ﬂux rope structure to the Northern and Southern footpoints of the large-scale
overlying loops observed in SUVI 195 ˚A images. These reconnections appear to trigger the eruption, during which the
cavity becomes well pronounced and is quickly expanding and rising (cf. Figure 2 and accompanying movie).

The expanding cavity appears dark in all AIA channels, indicative of the density depletion inside the cavity due to
the enhanced magnetic pressure of the enclosed ﬂux rope (e.g. Gibson 2015), and it is surrounded by a bright rim.
The hot bright rim (most distinctly observed in AIA 131 ˚A ﬁltergrams) that develops around the expanding dark
cavity has temperatures in the range T ≈ 10 − 15 MK (Long et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018), and its lower boundary is
connected to the rising cusp-shaped ﬂare loop system by a hot (T ≈ 20 MK) and thin elongated current sheet (Yan
et al. 2018; Warren et al. 2018). In the cooler coronal AIA 171 ˚A ﬁlter, reconnection inﬂows into the currents sheet
were observed with velocities of about 100 km s−1 (Yan et al. 2018). All these ﬁndings strongly suggest that the hot
rim around the expanding cavity is a manifestation of the new ﬂux and heated plasma that is added to the ﬂux rope
by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath.

The role of reconnection for the CME dynamics lies in transferring magnetic ﬂux from the ambient ﬁeld into poloidal
ﬂux of the ﬂux rope, which is associated with the current in the ﬂux rope. This additional ﬂux is important for the

16

CME acceleration, as it strengthens the hoop force acting on toroidal ﬂux ropes (Shafranov 1966; Chen 1989) and
reduces the eﬀect of the inductive decay of the electric current in the expanding ﬂux rope (Vrˇsnak 2008, 2016). The
reconnected ﬂux typically changes with time from a considerably sheared to a nearly purely poloidal one, as indicated
by the well known evolution of the ﬂare loops in many events (e.g., review by Fletcher et al. 2011). The ratio of
toroidal and poloidal ﬂux also diﬀers from event to event. In the present case, the formation of a complete rim around
the erupting ﬂux rope indicates that the reconnected ﬂux is dominantly poloidal from the beginning of the event (also
see Sect. 4.3).

In the 10 September 2017 event, the CME shell and the cavity reveal an unprecedented fast evolution. The peak
acceleration of both the lateral and radial expansion of the segmented CME shell are reached within the SUVI FOV.
The lateral CME expansion reaches a peak acceleration of 10.1 ± 1.1 km s−2, and in the radial direction we ﬁnd a peak
of 5.3 ± 1.4 km s−2 at a height of 0.62 Rs above the limb. Such high lateral acceleration values have not been reported
before, and the radial acceleration also is among the highest values reported. Statistically, CME peak accelerations lie
mostly in the range 0.1–1 km s−2 (Zhang & Dere 2006; Vrˇsnak et al. 2007; Bein et al. 2011; B¸ak-St¸e´slicka et al. 2013).
To our knowledge, only six CMEs have been reported with peak radial accelerations of the CME front (cid:38)5 km s−2
(Zhang et al. 2001; Williams et al. 2005; Vrˇsnak et al. 2007; Temmer et al. 2008; Bein et al. 2011; Ying et al. 2018).
Lateral accelerations of the CME ﬂanks are rarely derived, due to the diﬃculties in extracting the whole CME structure
low in the corona. The highest values we found in the literature are in the range of 1–2 km s−2 (Patsourakos et al.
2010a,b; Cheng et al. 2012).

We note that in a very recent paper on this event by Gopalswamy et al. (2018), a peak value of the radial CME
acceleration of 9.1 ± 1.6 km s−2 at 15:58 UT at a height of 2.05 Rs from Sun center is claimed. However, looking
into their kinematics plot (Figure 2), it is clear that this value is an artifact, arising from the transition between
two instruments when changing the measurement data from EUVI to COR1, which results in a local jump of the
distance-time curve. There is never a perfect transition in such combined measurements, because of diﬀerent emission
mechanisms and sensitivities of diﬀerent instruments. Thus, careful smoothing would be needed to properly account
for such discontinuities. However, in Gopalswamy et al. (2018) the velocity and acceleration proﬁles are derived
from direct numerical diﬀerentiation of the height-time measurement points. As one can see from their Figure 2, the
reported high (second) peak in the CME acceleration is obtained exactly at the time where the measurements change
from EUVI to COR1, and is a mere artifact of the numerics when calculating the ﬁrst and second time derivative
without accounting for instrumental discontinuities and noise in the data.

The acceleration of the width of the cavity occurs synchronized with the width of the CME shell. They reach
their peak acceleration at 15:53:40 and 15:53:50 UT, respectively, with values of 5.3 ± 1.4 km s−2 (cavity) and 10.1 ±
1.1 km s−2 (CME shell). The peak accelerations of their radial outward motion appear slightly later but again roughly
synchronized, with a value of 6.7 ± 0.6 km s−2 reached at 15:55:20 UT for the CME cavity and with a value of
5.3 ± 0.6 km s−2 at 15:54:40 UT for the CME shell. These peak times of the radial accelerations are also close in time
to the peak of the ﬁrst RHESSI 100–300 keV HXR burst (15:54:40 UT) of the associated ﬂare, further underlining the
importance of the reconnection process for the CME impulsive evolution. The magnetic reconnection in the current
sheet that is formed below the erupting ﬂux rope provides for the energy release of the ﬂare as well as additional
magnetic ﬂux to the ﬂux rope to further facilitate its acceleration. This coupling and feedback relation establishes a
synchronization of both processes, i.e. the ﬂare energy release, associated particle acceleration and the CME dynamics
(Zhang et al. 2001; Neupert et al. 2001; Vrˇsnak et al. 2004; Temmer et al. 2010; Berkebile-Stoiser et al. 2012).

Here, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the distinct hot rim observed around the ﬂux rope cavity is a manifes-
tation of the dominantly poloidal ﬂux and frozen-in plasma that is subsequently added to the expanding and rising
ﬂux rope by reconnection in the strong event under study. An implication of these unique observations is that due to
the very strong ﬁelds of up to 5 kG (Wang et al. 2018) and the large system of densely packed loops in the source
AR NOAA 12673, as observed in the EUV images, the values for the magnetic ﬂux and plasma densities of the re-
connnected loops are very high. These ﬁndings also explain why in this event, the (lateral and radial) accelerations in
the ﬂux rope and CME shell reach such extremely high values; all peak values lie in the range 5–10 km s−2. Vrˇsnak
(2016) modeled a curved ﬂux rope anchored in the photosphere, being subject to the kink and torus instability. He
found that in the most strongly accelerated eruptions, in which peak values of the order of 10 km s−2 are reached, the
poloidal ﬂux supplied by magnetic reconnection has to be several times larger than the initial ﬂux in the pre-erupting
ﬂux rope.

4.2. Overexpansion and relation between CME shell and cavity evolution

The CME shell and the cavity reveal not only an unprecedented fast evolution, but also a very strong overexpansion
in the low-to-mid corona, i.e. the sizes (widths) of the structures expand much faster than they gain in height (cf.
Patsourakos et al. 2010a,b). Further out in the coronagraphic FOV, generally an approximate self-similar CME
evolution is observed, i.e. the CME size and height increase at the same rate (Schwenn et al. 2005), keeping the
angular width and aspect ratio approximately constant. For the early evolution of the CME shell, we ﬁnd an impulsive
decrease of the aspect ratio from 0.98 to 0.75 during 15:53 to 15:57 UT, corresponding to an increase of its angular
width (measured from its source region on the limb) from about 90 to 105◦. Guo et al. (2018) derived an angular
width of about 130◦ from Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) ﬁtting of the CME observed by the coronagraphs onboard
LASCO and STEREO-A. This indicates that the CME width was still increasing after it has left the SUVI FOV, which
is consistent with the still increasing evolution seen in Figure 6f. For the cavity, we ﬁnd ﬁrst (from 15:50 to 15:53 UT)
a slight decrease of the angular widths, before changing to an impulsive increase during 15:53 to 15:55 UT (when it
exits the AIA FOV) from 18 to 28◦ (Figure 2d).

It is important to note that, in lateral direction, the CME shell expands much faster than the cavity (compare the
red curves in Figures 6d and 8b). This is also true for the loops between the cavity (ﬂux rope) and the CME shell (see
the 171, 193, and 211 ˚A channels in the animation of Figure 2). This means that, at these heights, these structures
are not piled up by the expanding ﬂux rope, but rather move away from it. More speciﬁcally, the CME shell is piled
up by the expanding motion of ambient coronal loops in the intermediate environment of the ﬂux rope (in a distance
range comparable to the height of the ﬂux rope) as the loops move away from the ﬂux rope and press against the
more distant coronal environment. This process obviously is part of the genesis of the CME, as it contributes to the
formation of the CME shell and its enclosed cavity in the early stages of the eruption (roughly within 1 Rs above the
photosphere). The expanding motion of ambient ﬂux, away from the rising ﬂux rope, has been noted by Patsourakos
et al. (2010a), who suggested that it is a consequence of decreasing current through the ﬂux rope as it rises. Kliem
et al. (2014) termed this a “reverse pinch eﬀect” and conﬁrmed it in MHD simulations of erupting ﬂux ropes (full
manuscript in preparation).

In the radial direction, the situation is reversed: here the cavity (ﬂux rope) rises faster than the overlying loops and
CME shell (blue curves in Figures 6d and 8b). This speed diﬀerence in the radial direction is seen more clearly in
Figure 10, where we jointly plot the kinematics of the outer front of the CME shell, the center of the CME shell, and
the center of the cavity. It is clearly seen how the cavity moves forward inside the CME shell (panel a) from close to its
bottom to beyond its center, due to its much higher velocity (panel b). Since the reverse pinch eﬀect should operate
in the vertical direction in the same way as in the lateral direction, the diﬀerent behavior, which results in the lateral
overexpansion of the CME shell, can only be explained by a stronger restraining force of the ambient corona in the
vertical direction. The preexisting set of prominent large-scale coronal loops which pass over the eruption site at about
0.5 Rs may provide this through a primarily downward directed tension force. High-reaching overlying loops typically
run nearly perpendicularly to the polarity inversion line, so that they resist the upward expansion of an erupting ﬂux
rope more than the lateral expansion, especially the lateral expansion perpendicular to the loops. Additionally, the
perturbation of a dominantly gravitationally stratiﬁed ambient corona by a developing CME can lead to a preferentially
downward restraining force and lateral overexpansion of the CME (Pagano et al. 2013). However, the plasma beta
in an active region with very strong photospheric ﬁeld strengths (up to 3 times higher than those assumed in Gary
(2001)) at heights of ∼ 0.5 Rs is still much smaller than unity, so that in the present event, the pressure gradient force
of the ambient corona is less likely to cause the overexpansion than the strong overlying loops.

4.3. Implications on the CME three-part structure

The distinct observations of the 10 September 2017 eruption provide us with important insight into the magnetic
morphology of the erupting structure. We observe a hot bright rim around a quickly expanding dark cavity, which is
embedded inside a much larger CME shell. The CME shell develops from a dense set of large pre-existing AR loops
(with sizes up to >0.5 Rs). During their expansion, successively higher overlying loops are piled-up, and become part
of the overall erupting structure (cf. Figures 1 and 5). The CME shell is best observed in the cooler ﬁlters of the SUVI
and AIA instruments (171, 195, 211 ˚A) sampling plasma at quiet coronal temperatures around 1–2 MK. The hot rim
around the expanding cavity is most distinctly observed in the AIA 131 ˚A ﬁlter, and has plasma temperatures in the
range 10–15 MK (Long et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018). It is a manifestation of the ﬂux and frozen-in plasma that is
added to the rising ﬂux rope by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath. As the plasma trapped on the

coronal loops overlying the erupting structure is brought into the current sheet below by the reconnection inﬂow, it
gets heated by the magnetic reconnection process. The heated plasma frozen to the downward closing ﬂux builds up
the hot ﬂare loop system, whereas the heated plasma frozen to the upward ejected poloidal ﬁelds forms the expanding
hot rim around the ﬂux rope.

The event under study also shows exceptionally well that the lower boundary of the hot rim around the cavity
is connected to the rising ﬂare loop system by a large-scale thin vertical current sheet, almost perfectly like in the
eruptive ﬂare cartoon in Figure 1 in Lin et al. (2004). Gary et al. (2018) report sources of nonthermal microwave
and hard X-ray emission indicative of accelerated electrons above the hot cusp-shaped ﬂare loops, with the microwave
sources extending even higher up into the indicated current sheet region. The thermal plasma in the elongated current
sheet has been diagnosed to have temperatures of about 20 MK (Warren et al. 2018). These observational ﬁndings
also provide strong evidence that in the present case the dark cavity outlines the cross-section of the ﬂux rope, which
is quickly expanding due to the continuously added ﬂux by the magnetic reconnection in the current sheet behind
the erupting structure. We note that the formation of a bright rim around quickly expanding ﬂux ropes due to the
reconnected poloidal ﬂux and plasma has been derived in the framework of the loss-of-equilibrium model (Lin et al.
2004). However, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst event showing it in observational data in perfect agreement with
the theoretical prediction.

What are the reasons that, in the event under study, all these structures are so well observed? —In addition to
the obviously favorable geometry with respect to the line of sight (i.e. that we look along the axis of the rising ﬂux
rope) and the excellent observational coverage of the low-to-mid corona by two wonderful EUV imagers, AIA and
SUVI, that combine high-cadence, large FOV and multi-temperature imagery, there are the following eﬀects. First,
the pre-eruptive structure in the source AR is special. The AR has very high magnetic ﬂux densities (up to 5 kG; Wang
et al. (2018)), and contains of a set of dense bright loops reaching up to very large heights ((cid:38)0.5Rs), as is indicated by
their intense EUV emission in the temperature range 1–2 MK (cf. Figure 1). In the course of the eruption, this set of
loops reconnects in the vertical current sheet. This means that high-density plasma is brought into the current sheet,
forming the downward closing ﬂare loops as well as the bright rim around the ﬂux rope. From a general perspective,
we expext that the mass that is brought into the cavity rim increases with the magnetic ﬁeld strength, because the rate
at which ﬁeld is brought into the reconnection region is proportional to the local Alfv´en speed (Lin et al. 2004). High
inﬂow speeds (v ≈ 100 km s−1) into the reconnecting current sheet behind the rising ﬂux rope have been reported for
the event under study (Yan et al. 2018). Another phenomenon that may come into play is that due to the very strong
ﬁelds involved and due to the rapid expansion (and associated density depletion and adiabatic cooling), the cavity
appears very dark. In addition, in the cooler AIA channels (where the bright rim around the cavity is not as distinct
as in the hotter ones), the cavity yields a particularly high contrast against the bright set of surrounding loops which
reaches high up into the corona.

As discussed in Lin et al. (2004), instead of the full hot rim around the erupting ﬂux rope, more often U- or V-
shaped structures are observed at the top of the current sheet, like in the 10% of white-light CMEs that are classiﬁed
as disconnection events, or also observed by EUV imagers low in the corona (e.g., R´egnier et al. 2011; Liu et al.
2013). The observations of U- or V-shaped structures suggest the existence of an organized ﬂux-rope like structure
(cf., Vourlidas et al. 2013). The more frequent appearance of U- or V-shaped structures instead of a complete rim may
be related to more moderate injection rates of the poloidal ﬂux by magnetic reconnection (Lin et al. 2004). Another
reason may be that in some events the ﬁeld lines are not suﬃciently strongly coiled around the ﬂux rope. Only in the
case of strongly coiled, i.e., dominantly poloidal ﬁelds, the ﬁeld lines below the ﬂux rope that come to reconnection
are winding close to the apex of the ﬂux rope, resulting in a high poloidal ﬂux component of the freshly reconnected
ﬁeld which would manifest itself in a complete bright rim structure. In the more general case, the ﬂux directly above
the erupting ﬂux rope (“strapping ﬂux”) is also strongly sheared. When this ﬂux comes to reconnection, it coils with
a strong toroidal, i.e. shear, component around the erupting ﬂux rope. This means that these ﬁelds manage to wind
around the ﬂux rope only far away from the apex, i.e. over the ﬂux rope legs, resulting in V- or U-shaped structures
of the hot plasma, when we observe along the axis of the ﬂux rope. The formation of a complete rim in the present
event suggests that the newly reconnected ﬂux around the ﬂux rope is dominantly poloidal from the beginning of the
event.

How do the structures of the eruption that we observe in the EUV connect to the traditional white-light coronagraph
data? The composites of co-temporal SUVI/LASCO C2 diﬀerence images plotted in Figure 3 clearly show that the
expanding CME shell observed in the SUVI 195 ˚A images ﬁts to the CME front observed in the LASCO C2 data. In
Figure 11 we plot a sequence of LASCO C2 and C3 direct images with less strong scaling to also obtain insight into
the inner morphology of the white-light CME. In all four frames (as well as in later C3 images) we see a core with a
bright rim-like structure embedded in the CME shell. In the C2 image at 16:12 UT, we can even see that this core has
a tear-drop shape, very similar to the cavity/rim morphology observed in the EUV (cf. Figure 2). To make sure that
this white-light structure corresponds to the cavity/rim observed in the EUV, we extrapolated the cavity height and
width kinematics derived from the SUVI and AIA EUV images to the LASCO FOV. Estimating the distance of the
center of the cavity from the radial kinematics curve in Figure 8a (blue curve), we obtain a distance from the solar
limb of ≈2.8 Rs at 16:12 UT. This roughly ﬁts with the distance of about 3.0 Rs of the rim-like core observed in C2
at that time. We also cross-checked the correspondence of the width of the hot rim observed in EUV and the width of
the rim observed in the white-light coronagraph images. Applying a linear ﬁt to the evolution of the cavity width in
Figure 8a (red curve) to the data after 14:53:30 UT, we obtain a mean expansion rate of about 0.041 Rs per minute.
Extrapolating this to the time 16:12 UT, where the rim-like structure is observed for the ﬁrst time in LASCO C2, we
obtain a width of 0.80 Rs. This is consistent with the width of the rim-like structure observed at that time in C2,
which is about 0.8–0.9 Rs. Note that this correspondence also implies that in the LASCO FOV the overexpansion of
the cavity has ceased and it is evolving almost self-similarly.

around the cavity as observed in the EUV into the white-light coronograph data (indicated by red arrows). We also note a local
deformation (“bulge”; indicated by yellow arrows) of the CME front/shock that is formed in the main direction of propagation
of the ﬂux rope (core), as it moves much faster than the outer CME shell (cf. Figure 10b).

These ﬁndings imply that — in the present event — the core of the CME observed in the white-light coronagraphs
is not a manifestation of the dense prominence plasma, as is the traditional view of the three-part CME structure, but
it is a manifestation of dominantly poloidal ﬂux and hot plasma continuously added around the expanding ﬂux rope
by the magnetic reconnection in the current sheet beneath. This is also consistent with the observations that in this
event there is only little evidence for erupting prominence plasma, which dissolves already very early in the eruption
(see Figure 2 and associated movie; cf. also Long et al. (2018)). These ﬁndings strongly support the same conclusions

21

in Lin et al. (2004) and Howard et al. (2017), and have important implications. First, the bright CME core observed
in white-light coronagraph images is not necessarily a signature of an embedded prominence. Second, the cross-section
of the erupting ﬂux rope can be signiﬁcantly smaller than the CME cavity in white-light images, diﬀerent from the
widely accepted suggestion in Chen et al. (1997).

Finally, we note that the white-light CME evolution in Figure 11 (most obviously in the C3 images) shows a distinct
deformation (“bulge”) of the outer CME front. This deformation is formed in the direction of motion of the expanding
ﬂux rope/cavity, which moves much faster than the outer CME shell, and is thus protruding from the bottom of the
CME shell (cf. Figure 10a,b). Such an accelerated motion of the ﬂux rope with a speed considerably higher than that
of the plasma overlying it, causes a continuous compression of the magnetoplasma ahead of the ﬂux rope, inevitably
creating an MHD wave signal that propagates through the overlying CME structures, including the sheath region in
front of the eruption. Since the speed of the driver is increasing (cf. Figure 10b, red curve), each new element of the
wavefront has successively higher amplitude, implying that it propagates faster than the previous wavefront elements
(for the relationship between the driver kinematics and the wavefront velocity proﬁle and kinematics see Vrˇsnak &
Luli´c (2000)). Thus, the new wavefront elements sweep over the previous ones, overtaking them and heading towards
the leading edge of the erupting structure. Finally, when the fastest elements reach the forehead of the structure, and
continue the outward propagation faster than the ﬂank elements of the erupting structure, the described eﬀect causes
a local deformation of the shape of the overlying large-scale CME shell and the associated shock front in the form
of a bulge. Such inhomogeneities and local regions of faster propagation speeds are a severe challenge and source of
uncertainty in predictions of the arrival time/speed of the CME, its shock and the space weather eﬀects it produces
(see also T¨or¨ok et al. (2018)).

4.4. EUV wave formation

The associated EUV wave reveals high speeds,

increasing with height from about 750 km s−1 at 0.05 Rs to
1200 km s−1 at 0.5 Rs above the solar limb. Such a behaviour is also found in numerical simulations (e.g., Fig-
ure 6 in Vrˇsnak et al. (2016)), and it is most likely related to the combination of two eﬀects: the ambient Alfv´en speed
increasing with height (Mann et al. 1999) and the ﬂux rope overexpansion (e.g., Figure 2c in Vrˇsnak et al. (2016)).
Toward the Northern direction, the EUV wave can be distinguished from the driver (the CME ﬂank) already at a
distance as close as about 40 Mm at 15:52:24 UT. This is signiﬁcantly smaller than typical distances of 100–200 Mm
at which EUV and Moreton waves become observable (Warmuth et al. 2004; Kienreich et al. 2011). As shown in the
simulations in Vrˇsnak et al. (2016), shock formation close to the contact surface implies a very impulsive acceleration
of the driver. The early shock formation in this event is also supported by the associated metric type II burst, which
starts at 15:53 UT (Gopalswamy et al. 2018). A fast acceleration of the piston results in a higher wave amplitude and
speed of the wave crest, and consequently to formation of the shock in a shorter time/distance. This is fully consistent
with our observations of an extremely fast lateral expansion of the CME with peak values up to 10 km s−2, and the
formation of the EUV wave close to the CME ﬂank during the rise of its impulsive acceleration. Toward the Southern
direction, the wave front can only later be distinguished from the CME ﬂanks, which implies either that the lateral
expansion in this direction is not that impulsive as in the northern direction and/or that the ambient Alfv´en speed is
higher here, so the process of wavefront steepening is slower.

The observations of the wave formation presented provide strong evidence for the interpretation of the global large-
amplitude coronal EUV wave formation by a 3D piston mechanism (for the terminology and the physical background
see, e.g., Vrˇsnak (2005); Warmuth (2015)). Firstly, the wave speed is much higher than the speed of the expanding
CME ﬂank. This is a typical signature of the wave formation by the piston mechanism (see e.g., the simulation results
presented in Fig. 6b in Vrˇsnak et al. (2016), showing that the wave is about two times faster than the piston), whereas
in the case of a bow-shock scenario the speeds of the driver and the wave should be comparable (Vrˇsnak 2005, and
references therein). The higher speed of the wave as compared to the driver, indicative of a 3D piston mechanism,
is well in line with the observations in the present case, where the CME ﬂank expansion at diﬀerent height levels is
considerably slower than the EUV wave formed, by a factor 2–3 (compare the blue and black lines outlining the CME
ﬂank and EUV wave propagation in the stack plots in Figure 9). Secondly, according to simulations presented in
Vrˇsnak et al. (2016), at low coronal heights (at the height of the ﬂux rope center), the wave is formed and ﬁrst appears
during the impulsive lateral expansion of the magnetic structure, i.e. close in time to the CME peak acceleration and
spatially close to its “contact surface” (see Fig. 6a,b therein, and the supporting observations in Patsourakos et al.
(2010a) and Cheng et al. (2012)). This is in good correspondence with the distance/time we ﬁnd in the observations

22

of the event under study: 15:52:30 UT corresponds to the impulsive lateral acceleration phase of the CME shell, where
the lateral acceleration has already reached a value as high as 6 km s−2, and the impulsive decrease of the CME aspect
ratio. Finally, we note that in the observations we identify a transient dimming travelling behind the wavefront (Figure
1 and associated movie), which is expected in the case of wave formation due to the 2D and/or 3D piston mechanism
(Landau & Lifshitz 1987; Vrˇsnak et al. 2016).

Interestingly, despite the strength, high speed and global propagation of this EUV wave (see also Liu et al. 2018),
it did not reveal any signature of an associated Moreton wave. This means that the pressure pulse initiated by the
coronal wave was not strong enough to suﬃciently perturb the underlying denser chromospheric plasma (e.g. Vrˇsnak
et al. 2016). This is probably due to the fact that in the present case the main lateral CME expansion — although
very strong and impulsive (with a peak acceleration of 10 km s−2) — happened at a comparatively large height and
started from a large source region. Finally, we note that this event was associated with a wide-spread SEP event,
covering >230◦ in helio-longitude (Guo et al. 2018). We may speculate that the formation of this wide-spread SEPs
is also related to the extremely impulsive lateral expansion of the CME and the associated coronal shock formation
close to the Sun.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The CME associated with the X8.2 ﬂare of 10 September 2017 provides us with unique observations on the genesis,
In this event, the
the magnetic morphology and the impulsive dynamical evolution of a very fast solar eruption.
diﬀerent parts of the CME can be clearly identiﬁed and followed in multi-temperature EUV images, and uniquely
associated with the morphology in the white-light coronagraph data.

We clearly demonstrate that the hot bright rim observed around the quickly expanding EUV cavity is formed by
the dominantly poloidal ﬂux and the attached heated plasma that is added to the erupting ﬂux rope by magnetic
reconnection in the large-scale current sheet beneath, and that this structure extends into the coronagraph FOV as
CME core. These ﬁndings corroborate the recently suggested rethink of the traditional view on the three-part CME
morphology, which interprets the CME core as the signature of the erupting ﬂux rope, rather than as the signature
of prominence material trapped in the bottom part of the ﬂux rope. Further studies are needed to quantify in what
fraction of CMEs the core is a manifestation of the prominence and/or of the reconnected poloidal ﬂux and plasma,
and how we can use these observations to obtain estimates of the poloidal ﬂux supplied to the eruption by magnetic
reconnection and sustaining its acceleration. Our ﬁndings also imply that the cross-section of the erupting ﬂux rope
can be signiﬁcantly smaller than the CME cavity observed in white-light images.

In the present event, the clearly deﬁned CME structures together with the high-cadence large-FOV EUV imagery
also allowed us to derive the impulsive dynamics separately for the radial and lateral expansions of both the CME
shell and the ﬂux rope, all of which revealed extreme acceleration values with peaks in the range 5–10 km s−1. The
much higher radial propagation speed of the ﬂux rope as compared to the CME shell is identiﬁed to be the reason
for the substantial deformation of the white light CME front and shock in the form of a faster moving bulge. Such
local inhomogeneities have important implications for space weather forecasts, as they pose additional diﬃculties in
the prediction of the CME arrival time and speed at Earth. Finally, we note that both the CME shell and the
ﬂux rope exhibit a strong lateral overexpansion during the impulsive phase of the event. The overexpansion and the
2D/3D-piston mechanism are essential for generating the fast and globally propagating EUV wave associated.
