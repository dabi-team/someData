ABSTRACT

Context. Super-sonic downﬂows have been observed in transition region spectra above numerous sunspots; however, little research
has been conducted to date into how persistent these signatures are within sunspots on time-scales longer than a few hours.
Aims. Here, we aim to analyse the lead sunspot of AR 12526 to infer the properties and evolution of super-sonic downﬂows occurring
within it using high-spatial and spectral resolution data.
Methods. Sixteen large, dense raster scans sampled by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph are analysed. These rasters tracked
the lead sunspot of AR 12526 across the solar disc at discrete times between the 27th March 2016 and the 2nd April 2016, providing
spectral proﬁles from the Si iv, O iv, Mg ii, and C ii lines. Additionally, one sit-and-stare observation acquired on the 1st April 2016
centred on the sunspot is studied in order to analyse the evolution of super-sonic downﬂows on shorter time-scales.
Results. Super-sonic downﬂows are variable within this sunspot both in terms of spatial structuring and velocities. 13 of the 16 raster
scans display some evidence of super-sonic downﬂows in the Si iv 1394 Å line co-spatial to a sustained bright structure detected
in the 1400 Å slit-jaw imaging channel, with a peak velocity of 112 km s−1 being recorded on the 29th March 2016. Evidence for
super-sonic downﬂows in the O iv 1401 Å line was found in 14 of these rasters, with the spatial structuring in this line often diﬀering
from that inferred from the Si iv 1394 Å line. Only one example of a super-sonic downﬂow was detected in the C ii 1335 Å line,
with no downﬂows being found in the Mg ii 2796 Å lines at these locations. In the sit-and-stare observations, no dual ﬂow is initially
detected, however, a super-sonic downﬂow does develop after around 60 minutes. This downﬂow accelerates from 73 km s−1 to close
to 80 km s−1 in both the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv 1401 Å lines over the course of 20 minutes before the end of the observation.
Conclusions. Super-sonic downﬂows were found in the Si iv 1394 Å line in 13 of the 16 rasters studied here. The morphology of
these downﬂows evolved over the course of both hours and days and was often diﬀerent in the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv 1401 Å lines.
These events were found co-spatial to a bright region in the core of the Si iv 1394 Å line which appeared to form at the foot-points of
coronal fan loops. Our results indicate that one raster is not enough to conclusively draw inferences about the properties of super-sonic
downﬂows within a sunspot during its lifetime.

1. Introduction

The solar atmosphere above sunspots is highly dynamic, with
a range of transient events and oscillations being reported in
the literature (for reviews see, for example, Solanki 2003;
Khomenko & Collados 2015). These strong regions of vertical
magnetic ﬁeld (Hale 1908) act as an ideal conduit along which
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves can propagate from the
lower solar atmosphere into the upper solar atmosphere (ex-
amples include Fludra 2001; Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2003;
Jess et al. 2012; Sych & Nakariakov 2014) potentially deposit-
ing their energy to heat the local corona. It is important to note,
however, that not everything within umbrae is always moving
upwards. It is now known that downﬂowing plasma can play
an important role in sunspot dynamics, having been associated
with strong shocks in both the chromosphere (Henriques et al.
2017; Nelson et al. 2017) and the transition region (as discussed
by, e.g., Dere 1982; Brynildsen et al. 2001, 2004; Kleint et al.
2014).

Dynamic shocks in the solar chromosphere such as um-
bral ﬂashes have been linked to upﬂowing plasma for decades
(see, for example, Beckers & Tallant 1969; Wittmann 1969;
Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2003). However, recent non-LTE

modelling of chromospheric lines using inversion codes such
as NICOLE (Socas-Navarro et al. 2015) has indicated that such
events could be formed by a blend of an upwardly propa-
gating wave on a strongly downﬂowing background (as dis-
cussed by Henriques et al. 2017; Bose et al. 2019). Interestingly,
such a model could also be invoked to simultaneously ex-
plain other events in the chromospheres of sunspots including
Small-Scale Umbral Brightenings (Nelson et al. 2017) and short
dynamic ﬁbrils (Rouppe van der Voort & de la Cruz Rodríguez
2013). Downﬂows have also been observed above rapidly evolv-
ing pores using the He i 10830 Å line (Lagg et al. 2007).

Super-sonic downﬂows in the transition region above
sunspots have been of interest to the community ever since
their discovery (see, for example, Dere 1982; Nicolas et al.
1982; Kjeldseth-Moe et al. 1988; Brynildsen et al. 2001, 2004;
Tian et al. 2014a; Kleint et al. 2014; Samanta et al. 2018). These
‘dual ﬂows’, which manifest as strongly red-shifted secondary
emission peaks in transition region spectra such as Si iv and O iv,
form in localised regions of both the umbra and penumbra (as
shown by the recent statistical analysis of Samanta et al. 2018).
It has been suggested that these super-sonic downﬂows are as-
sociated with lightbridges in the lower solar atmosphere, how-
ever, the details of such a relationship are currently unknown
(Nicolas et al. 1982). The extensive availability of high-spectral,

Initially, no lightbridge was evident, however, by the 31st March 2016 one large lightbridge had developed in the northern region of the sunspot. A
second lightbridge was also present in the southern portion of the sunspot, however, this was smaller and less obvious than the northern lightbridge.

temporal, and spatial resolution data since the launch of the In-
terface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al.
2014) has allowed improved understanding of these events over
recent years (for a recent review see Tian et al. 2018).

It is now thought possible that at least two diﬀerent types
of dual ﬂows may exist in the transition region. Bursty, short-
lived (of the order seconds) downﬂows with velocities of up
to 200 km s−1 have been detected and associated with impul-
sive coronal rain (see, for example, Kleint et al. 2014). Typically,
these events appear to have signatures in a wide complement
of IRIS diagnostics, including the Mg ii, C ii, and Si iv lines. Of
more relevance here, potentially, are downﬂows which appear to
have lifetimes of the order minutes to hours and typical veloc-
ities of around 100 km s−1 (as discussed by, e.g., Straus et al.
2015; Chitta et al. 2016). These events, which are potentially
linked to siphon ﬂows, are generally observed in the Si iv and
O iv lines with only occasional signatures in the Mg ii and C ii
lines (Samanta et al. 2018). Although these events have some-
times been observed to be stable over time-scales of the order
hours, it is likely that they will evolve signiﬁcantly over the
course of several days (Kjeldseth-Moe et al. 1988). Interestingly,
the inferred downﬂow velocity from the O iv lines has sometimes
been found to be around 10 km s−1 lower than the velocity cal-
culated from the Si iv lines potentially implying the presence of
multi-thermal, multi-threaded loops (Dere 1982; Nicolas et al.
1982; Chitta et al. 2016). It should be noted, however, that such

a disparity in the downﬂow speeds measured from these spectral
lines is not always present (Samanta et al. 2018).

In this article, we analyse the evolution of super-sonic down-
ﬂows within the lead sunspot of AR 12526 over the course of
one week using high-resolution IRIS data. Of speciﬁc interest
here is understanding how persistent such downﬂows are within
the sunspot, over both short and long time-scales. Our work is set
out as follows: In Sect. 2 we introduce the satellite data studied
here; In Sect. 3 we present our results, including analysis of both
raster data and sit-and-stare observations; In Sect. 4 we present
a discussion and our conclusions; Finally, in Sect. 5 we provide
a brief summary.

2. Observations

Initially, sixteen 400-step dense (0.35′′ step-size) rasters cover-
ing AR 12526 at discrete times between 27th March 2016 and
2nd April 2016 were studied. For each of these datasets the slit
length was 175′′, the exposure time was 8 s (with a step cadence
of 9.2 s), and the spectral samplings were 0.025 Å and 0.05 Å
for the FUV and NUV channels, respectively. During the rasters,
the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) sampled each of the 1330 Å, 1400 Å,
2796 Å, and 2832 Å channels sequentially, providing 100 images
per raster for each ﬁlter. Each SJI image sampled a 167′′×175′′
ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) which tracked the IRIS slit, giving a total
FOV of 307′′×175′′. The cadence of each of the slit-jaw chan-

(aqua and blue correspond to 50 km s−1 and 75 km s−1, respectively). All super-sonic downﬂows within the sunspot are co-spatial to a sustained
region of increased intensity in the line core. Again, pointing coordinates are not relative and are only provided for an indication of scale. The
white contours plot the outline of the sunspot as inferred from the average intensity in the continuum between the two Mg ii lines. It should be

nels was approximately 37 s and the pixel scale was 0.33′′. The
basic information for each of these datasets is included for ref-
erence in the ﬁrst ﬁve columns of Table 1. The OBS ID for each
raster was: 3600108078.

To supplement the raster data, we also analysed one sit-
and-stare sequence sampled by IRIS between 16:23:28 UT and
17:44:22 UT on the 1st April 2016. During this time, the slit
passed north-south through the umbra of the lead sunspot within
AR 12526 at coordinates of xc=480′′, yc=34′′ (centre of the slit).
These data had a 15 s exposure time (giving a cadence of 16.7 s)
returning a total of 290 spectra. The slit length was 119′′ and the
spectral sampling in both the NUV and FUV channels was ap-
proximately 0.025 Å. The SJI sampled a 119′′×119′′ FOV with
the 1400 Å and 2796 Å channels sequentially, meaning each ﬁl-
ter had a cadence of approximately 33 s. The pixel scale of these
SJI data was around 0.17′′. The OBS ID for this sit-and-stare
sequence was 3680261403. Wavelength calibration for the FUV
and NUV channels was conﬁrmed for all IRIS datasets through
analysis of the neutral O i 1355.6 Å and Ni i 2799.5 Å lines.

Finally, we studied data from the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI;
Scherrer et al. 2012) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(SDO/AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) to give photospheric and coronal
context to our analysis. Single line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld

maps and continuum intensity images from the SDO/HMI in-
strument co-temporal to the start of each raster and sit-and-stare
sequence were downloaded and reduced, with a post-reduction
pixel scale of 0.6′′ and a cadence of 45 s. Additonally, SDO/AIA
304 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å ﬁlter images were downloaded for the
time-period corresponding to the entire sit-and-stare sequence.
with post-reduction pixel scales and cadences of 0.6′′ and 12 s,
respectively. A single SDO/AIA 1600 Å image co-temporal to
the start of the sit-and-stare sequence was also downloaded for
alignment purposes. Initial alignment between all instruments
was accomplished to the leading order using header informa-
tion before more accurate alignments were completed by visu-
ally matching features in the SDO/HMI continuum, SDO/AIA
1600 Å, and IRIS SJI Mg ii 2796 Å channels.

3. Results

3.1. Raster Scans

We begin our analysis by providing a brief overview of the
general properties of the sunspot studied here through time. In
Fig. 1, we plot the sunspot as sampled by the SDO/HMI con-
tinuum ﬁlter at the start of six of the raster scans detailed in Ta-
ble 1, one for each day in which a raster exits. On the 27th March

Fig. 3. Same as Fig. 2 but for the O iv 1401 Å line. Note that the spatial coverage of downﬂows in the top left and top middle panels is larger than
for the respective Si iv 1394 Å plots. Additionally, the bottom right panel displays evidence of a super-sonic downﬂow in the O iv 1401 Å line
when no downﬂow was detected in the Si iv 1394 Å line for this raster.

2016, no lightbridge is evident within the umbra of what appears
to be a relatively circular sunspot. Over the course of the next
three days, however, the sunspot becomes more elongated in the
north-south direction before two distinct lightbridges develop on
the 31st March 2016. Both lightbridges have an east-west ori-
entation with one forming in the north and one forming in the
south, essentially splitting the umbra into three equal portions.
The northern lightbridge has a higher contrast than the south-
ern lightbridge making it more evident in the SDO/HMI images
plotted here. Both lightbridges are present up to the time of the
ﬁnal raster at 02:41 UT on the 2 April 2016.

In order to investigate whether super-sonic downﬂows were
present in the transition region of the sunspot during these scans,
we perfomed double Gaussian ﬁtting to the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv
1401 Å spectra (using gauss_ f it.pro) on each pixel around the
sunspot between velocities of −45 km s−1 and +175 km s−1. For
the Si iv 1394 Å line, we considered that a super-sonic downﬂow
had been detected when the peak intensity of the line was larger
than 50 DN in this spectral range and when a Gaussian was re-
turned between 50 km s−1 and 150 km s−1 with a peak intensity
larger than 30 DN and a width (in Doppler units) of larger than
10 km s−1. For the O iv 1401 Å line, the required initial thresh-
olding intensity of the line was 30 DN, the maximum returned
velocity was 100 km s−1 (larger values were searched for manu-
ally but were only detected once and, therefore, this lower peak
velocity was implemented to minimise the eﬀects of noise in the
ﬁtting), and the secondary emission peak was required to have

an intensity of over 20 DN. The background transition region
intensity of the FOV was estimated through the construction of
two-dimensional maps of the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv 1401 Å line
intensities at their rest wavelengths.

In Fig. 2, we plot six examples of the Si iv 1394 Å core
intensity maps, where each panel corresponds to the respec-
tive panel in Fig. 1. An extended bright region is clear in the
sunspot (the outline of the umbra as inferred from the Mg ii
continuum between the two spectral lines is over-laid in white)
stretching above both the umbra and penumbra throughout the
time-period analysed here. The coloured contours outline re-
gions where downﬂows were detected with aqua indicating a ve-
locity of over 50 km s−1 and blue indicating a velocity of over
75 km s−1. Applying the typical formation temperatures of the
Si iv 1394 Å line (104.8 − 105 K) to the formula Cs=152 T0.5 m
s−1 (Priest 1984) allows us to infer that downﬂow velocities over
50 km s−1 will be super-sonic. It should be noted that the FOV in
Fig. 2 and the FOV in Fig. 1 are not perfectly aligned due to the
diﬀerent rasters sampling slightly diﬀerent regions around the
sunspot with some rasters only partially covering the penumbra.
The choice was made to have this slight oﬀ-set in the FOVs to
better emphasise the evolution of the entire spot in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 3, we reproduce Fig. 2 but with the background in-
tensity and velocity contours calculated from the O iv 1401 Å
line. It is immediately evident that super-sonic downﬂows in the
O iv 1401 Å line covered a larger spatial extent than super-sonic
downﬂows in the Si iv 1394 Å line in the top left and top mid-

the raster; y-coordinate of the centre of the raster; x-pixel where the largest super-sonic downﬂow was inferred from the Si iv 1394 Å line; y-pixel
where the largest super-sonic downﬂow was inferred from the Si iv 1394 Å line; Peak downﬂow velocity calculated from double Gaussian ﬁtting
of the Si iv 1394 Å line; Downﬂow velocity in the O iv 1401 Å line co-spatial to the peak Si iv 1394 Å velocity (except bottom row where the peak

dle panels, with downﬂows occurring along almost the entirety
of the transition region brightening. To quantify this, we calcu-
lated the number of pixels within which super-sonic downﬂows
over 50 km s−1 were detected for both the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv
1401 Å lines (the criteria deﬁned in the second paragraph of this
section). In the top left panel, super-sonic downﬂows were de-
tected in 62 and 127 pixels respectively. Within the top middle
panel the corresponding number of pixels for the two lines was
61 and 136. Although such a large disparity in the number of
pixels displaying super-sonic downﬂows in the Si iv 1394 Å and
O iv 1401 Å lines is not apparent in each raster studied here (see
ﬁnal two columns of Table 1), this result does conﬁrm that the
spatial structuring of these dual ﬂows can be diﬀerent in dif-
ferent spectral (i.e., thermal) windows. Additionally, the bottom
right panel displays evidence of a super-sonic downﬂow in the
O iv 1401 Å line which is not present in the Si iv 1394 Å line,
further highlighting the diﬀerence in spatial structuring between
these wavelengths.

Of the 16 raster scans analysed here, 13 (14) displayed ev-
idence of downﬂows with velocities larger than 50 km s−1 in
the Si iv 1394 Å (O iv 1401 Å) line. All detected super-sonic
downﬂows formed co-spatial to the intense structure at the cen-
tre of the sunspot easily evident in the Si iv 1394 Å line core (see
Fig. 2), with no dual ﬂows being detected in the sunspot away
from this transition region brightening. The evolution of the
super-sonic downﬂows through time exhibited no clear pattern,
with the spatial positioning along the brightening and the sizes
of the detected downﬂows changing considerably from raster to
raster. To display this, we plot the peak downﬂow velocity in the
Si iv 1394 Å line (red squares) and the co-spatial, co-temporal
downﬂow velocities from the O iv 1401 Å line (blue crosses) in
Fig. 4. We note that super-sonic downﬂows were not detected in
the O iv 1401 Å line at the sites of the peak Si iv 1394 Å down-
ﬂow velocities in three rasters (see Table 1 for detailed informa-
tion). The error bars indicate the spectral sampling of the data

and the dashed vertical line indicates the approximate formation
time of the lightbridges.

Each of the ten datasets sampled prior to the appearance of
the lightbridges (14:24 on the 31st March 2016) displayed some
evidence of super-sonic downﬂows in the Si iv 1394 Å line co-
spatial to the sunspot transition region brightening (see Table 1).
Downﬂow velocities of over 70 km s−1 were detected in all of
these datasets, with velocities of over 100 km s−1 even being
evident in two rasters (the consecutive scans starting at 06:13
UT and 09:29 UT on the 29th March 2016). As the sunspot ro-
tated from xc=−595′′ to xc=171′′ during this time we compar-
ing the projected and deprojected downﬂow velocities to con-
ﬁrm that the µ-angle of the observation did not aﬀect our results.
We found only small change in the estimated downﬂow veloc-
ity of around 5 km s−1 (comparable to the spectral sampling).
The spatial structuring of the detected dual ﬂows in these rasters
was extremely variable with large areas of downﬂows (65 < pix-

els) being detected in the Si iv 1394 Å line in ﬁve datasets and
only small (< 25 pixels) areas of downﬂows being evident in the
remaining ﬁve raster scans.

Following the appearance of the lightbridges, however,
super-sonic downﬂows became spatially much less prevalent
within the sunspot (see the bottom row of Fig. 2). Indeed, all
three datasets for which no downﬂows of over 50 km s−1 were
detected in the Si iv 1394 Å line occurred following the appear-

ance of the lightbridges (the ﬁnal six rows of Table 1). The super-
sonic downﬂows in the further three rasters were extremely lo-
calised with spatial extents of only a few pixels (18, 9, and 7
pixels each in the Si iv 1394 Å line), while only one displayed
evidence of a super-sonic downﬂow with a velocity of over 75
km s−1. Overall, the average peak downﬂow velocity in the Si iv
1394 Å line prior to the formation of the lightbridges is 91.4
km s−1 compared to 71 km s−1 (calculated from the three rasters

which displayed super-sonic downﬂows) after the formation of
the lightbridges. We cannot conﬁdently comment on whether the
change in the super-sonic velocities apparent here is caused by
the formation of the lightbridges or not due to the small num-
ber of scans collected both before and after this time, how-
ever, we can conclusively say that the presence of lightbridges
in a sunspot is not a required condition for the occurrence of
super-sonic downﬂows in the transition region (hypothesised by
Nicolas et al. 1982).

To further investigate these super-sonic downﬂows, we ex-
amined the spectra of the O iv 1401 Å, C ii 1335 Å, and Mg ii
2796 Å lines co-spatial to the peak downﬂow velocity detected
in the Si iv 1394 Å line for each raster (pixel locations included
in Table 1). Super-sonic downﬂows were present at these loca-
tions in the O iv 1401 Å line for 10 of the 13 datasets, with the
velocities (calculated by ﬁtting double Gaussians at these loca-
tions) returned being comparable to the velocities inferred from
the Si iv 1394 Å line (agreeing with the results of Samanta et al.
2018). The core intensity of the O iv 1401 Å line for two of the
datasets in which no super-sonic downﬂows were detected were
extremely low meaning any dual peaks in the line wing would
likely be below the noise level. Additionally, one example of a
super-sonic downﬂow, with a peak velocity of 61 km s−1, was
detected in the O iv 1401 Å line in a raster when no Si iv 1394 Å

downﬂow was apparent (bottom row of Table 1). One example
of a downﬂow was inferred from the C ii 1335 Å line, with the
velocity of 100 km s−1 being 15 km s−1 faster than the local Si iv
1394 Å downﬂow (see Table 1). From this one observation we
are unable to comment on the generality or signiﬁcance of this
result. No signature of super-sonic downﬂows was detected in
the Mg ii 2796 Å lines co-spatial to these dual ﬂows.

Finally, we provide a brief overview of the raster sampled
prior to the sit-and-stare observations analysed in the following
sub-section. In the top row of Fig. 5, we plot the intensity of
the Si iv 1394 Å line at three diﬀerent positions within the spec-
tral proﬁle. The sunspot brightening within which all super-sonic
downﬂows are detected here manifests as an arc-like structure
in the rest wavelength at this time (top left panel), however, at
31 km s−1 (corresponding to approximately 0.15 Å from the line
core) only the northern and southern-most regions of the arc-like
structure are evident. Further out into the line at approximately
64 km s−1 (around 0.3 Å from the line core), only the south-
ern region of the brightening structure has a signature indicating
that no super-sonic downﬂows are present at the northern end
of the brightening. In the middle row of Fig. 5 we plot a spec-
tral representation of this from the Si iv 1394 Å line with the
intensities taken at the location of the crosses in the upper pan-
els. The super-sonic downﬂow is evidenced by the secondary

During this time, the ﬂow accelerates at approximately 5 m s−2 from around 73 km s−1 to close to 80 km s−1, as indicated by the dashed blue line.

but for the O iv 1401 Å line. Note, the secondary peak in the O iv
1401 Å line is not large enough to be returned automatically by
the algorithm used here.

3.2. Sit-And-Stare Sequence

To continue our analysis, we conducted a more detailed inves-
tigation of the signatures of super-sonic downﬂows within the
sunspot in a sit-and-stare observation sampled on the 1st April
2016. In Fig. 6 we plot the FOV at the beginning of the observa-
tion, including the SDO/HMI magnetogram and continuum (top
left and middle panels), the IRIS chromospheric Mg ii 2796 Å
and transition region Si iv 1400 Å ﬁlters (top right and bottom
left panels, respectively), and the SDO/AIA 304 Å and 171 Å
channels (bottom middle and right panels). Each panel plots the
nearest frame for that channel to 16:23:28 UT. The blue contours
over-laid on Fig. 6 map the brightest regions within the sunspot
in the 1400 Å channel, corresponding to the bright arc-like struc-
ture plotted in the top left panel of Fig. 5. The blue contours on
the SDO/HMI continuum panel conﬁrm that this arc-like bright-
ening stretches across the well-developed northern lightbridge.

Article number, page 8 of 11

No evidence of this brightening is apparent in the cooler Mg ii
2796 Å ﬁlter.

As can be seen in Fig. 6, the IRIS slit passed directly through
the northern end of the arc-like brightening during the sit-and-
stare sequence, away from the location where super-sonic down-
ﬂows were detected in the preceding raster (see Fig. 5). In Fig. 7,
we plot spectral-time plots for both the Si iv 1394 Å and the O iv
1401 Å lines for the length of the sit-and-stare observation for
a pixel within the brightening. Initially, no super-sonic down-
ﬂow is apparent in either line, agreeing with the spectra sampled
for this location during the raster observation (Fig. 5); however,
a downﬂow begins to develop with an initial velocity of ≈ 72
km s−1 in both the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv 1401 Å lines after
around minute 60 (corresponding to approximately 17:25 UT).
The downﬂow then accelerates at approximately 5 m s−2 to a
velocity of ≈ 80 km s−1 over the course of the remaining ∼ 20
minutes, indicated by the dashed blue line.

In the top left and top middle panels of Fig. 8, we plot the
sunspot as sampled by the IRIS SJI 1400 Å ﬁlter in both the ﬁrst
and the last frames. The arc-like brightening is relatively stable
during this time, with only a small increase in brightness and
size detected at the north end over the course of the 80 minutes.
Plotting lightcurves of these increases in size and brightness (not
shown here) demostrates that they occur relatively consistently
throughout the observations and are continuously modulated by
the typical 3-minute sunspot oscillations. Additionally, the ra-

Fig. 8. Evolution of the SJI and spectral data through time. The ﬁrst and ﬁnal SJI frames (top left and top middle panels) show that the transition
region brightening remained relatively stable with only a small increase in the size of the northern brightening. The blue vertical lines indicate the
slits over which the spectra were averaged in the remaining panels. Spectra from the second and second-to-last raster steps (black and blue lines,
respectively) display an increase in intensity in all pass-bands during the super-sonic downﬂow, however, only the O iv and Si iv lines possess the
second peak in intensity in the red wing indicative of super-sonic downﬂows. The vertical dashed pink lines indicate the rest wavelengths of the
lines of interest.

tio of the Si iv 1394 Å and 1403 Å lines within the arc-like
brightening throughout the time-series remains close to 2 im-
plying no changes in the opacity of the lines occurs through time
(Mathioudakis et al. 1999). Overall, no large-scale morpholog-
ical changes are evident in the arc-like brightening during this
time despite the on-set of the super-sonic downﬂow.

In the other four panels of Fig. 8, the spectra from the sec-
ond and second-to-last slit exposures (black and blue lines, re-
spectively) are plotted. For the C ii and Mg ii lines (top right
and bottom left panels), increases in intensity of around 10-30
% are detected between the blue and black proﬁles, however, no
secondary peak associated with super-sonic downﬂows are evi-
dent. This is in agreement with the lack of foot-point signature
in the chromospheric Mg ii 2796 Å SJI data (see top right panel
of Fig. 6). For the Si iv and O iv lines (bottom middle and bottom
left panels), no peaks associated with super-sonic downﬂows are
present in the black spectra, however, such peaks are present in
the blue spectra with approximate velocities of 80 km s−1. No
signature of this downﬂow was evident in the raster scan start-
ing around 100 minutes following the end of the sit-and-stare
observation.

Interestingly, the arc-like brightening in the transition region
coincides spatially with the foot-points of two apparently dis-
tinct coronal fan loops in the 171 Å ﬁlter (see Fig. 6). A clear
separation appears to be present between the two distinct coro-
nal fan loops, with one being anchored in the northern section
of the umbra and one being anchored in the southern section of
the umbra. A clear gap between these two structures extends to
the edge of the FOV (the darker horizontal line at y ≈ 42′′) and
beyond. Although it is diﬃcult to track them along their entire
lengths, it is possible that the other ends of these two loop sys-

tems are rooted in completely separate locations within the Ac-
tive Region with the northern fan loops appearing to be rooted in
the trailing plage region and the southern fan loops potentially
rooted in the opposite polarity structures leading the sunspot.
Future analysis using Non-Linear Force Free magnetic ﬁeld ex-
trapolations could better map the connectivity of the Active Re-
gion and could, therefore, provide more evidence about where
these loops are anchored. Such research could allow us to better
examine the potential causes of these downﬂows.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

In Table 1, the basic properties of the 16 datasets analysed here
were presented. Overall, 13 of the 16 datasets included evidence
of super-sonic downﬂows in the Si iv 1394 Å line (a similar ra-
tio to that found by Samanta et al. 2018), with a peak velocity
of 112 km s−1 being found on the 29th March 2016. In Fig. 2,
the transition region intensity estimated by the rest wavelength
of the Si iv 1394 Å line was plotted and contours of downﬂow
velocities with magnitudes of 50 km s−1 (aqua) and 75 km s−1
(blue) over-laid. Fig. 3 plots the equivalent as calculated from
the O iv 1401 Å line. All super-sonic downﬂows detected within
the sunspot occurred co-spatial to a sustained transition region
brightening spanning across the umbra and penumbra. This tran-
sition region brightening appeared to map the locations of coro-
nal loop foot-points, as observed in the SDO/AIA 171 Å channel.
The spatial positioning of super-sonic downﬂows through time
was highly variable, with some rasters revealing relatively large-
scale downﬂows across the entire transition region brightening
and some rasters revealing only point-like downﬂows. Addition-
ally, the spatial coverage of dual ﬂows in the O iv 1401 Å line

Article number, page 9 of 11

A&Aproofs: manuscript no. Umbral_Loop_ArXiv

was often diﬀerent to the spatial coverage in the Si iv 1394 Å
line, with the spatial coverage in the O iv 1401 Å line sometimes
being double that of the Si iv 1394 Å line.

From both Table 1 and Fig. 4, it is immediately evident that
the peak velocity of super-sonic downﬂows within the umbra
is variable through time. This result is in agreement with previ-
ous temporal analyses of super-sonic downﬂows within sunspots
(Kjeldseth-Moe et al. 1988) and suggests that single measure-
ments of an AR are unable to provide general information about
the properties of super-sonic downﬂows. The average super-
sonic downﬂow velocity in the Si iv 1394 Å line, in rasters where
such downﬂows were observed, was calculated to be 86.7 km
s−1 (consistent with previous measurements using IRIS data by,
for example, Straus et al. 2015; Chitta et al. 2016; Samanta et al.
2018). Interestingly, super-sonic downﬂows were detected both
before and after the formation of lightbridges in the sunspot indi-
cating that lightbridges in the umbra are not an essential require-
ment for the formation of super-sonic downﬂows in transition
region spectra (as speculated by Nicolas et al. 1982).

Super-sonic downﬂows were also detected in the O iv 1401
Å line at the same spatial locations as the peak Si iv 1394 Å
downﬂow velocity in 10 of the 13 rasters (pixel co-ordinates in
Table 1). For the other three rasters, downﬂows were apparent in
the O iv 1401 Å in the surrounding pixels again highlighting the
diﬀerences in spatial structuring between these two lines. Addi-
tionally, one raster displayed evidence of a super-sonic downﬂow
in the O iv 1401 Å when no downﬂow was apparent in the Si iv
1394 Å line. As has been found in previous analyses (see, for ex-
ample, Samanta et al. 2018), the downﬂow velocities in the O iv
1401 Å line were similar to those inferred from the Si iv 1394
Å line. One example of a super-sonic downﬂow in the C ii 1334
Å line was detected at these locations, with the estimated down-
ﬂow velocity of this line being 15 km s−1 larger than the down-
ﬂow inferred from the Si iv 1394 Å line at the same position. No
signature was detected in the Mg ii 2796 Å lines at any of these
locations. Overall, our results could be interpreted as evidence
for the presence of multi-thermal, multi-threaded loops (see, for
example, Dere 1982; Nicolas et al. 1982), however, they do not
rule out other possibilities. If these spectral lines are forming at
diﬀerent heights in the solar atmosphere, one possible interpre-
tation could be that we are observing the acceleration of material
down from the hotter regions (Si iv and O iv lines) to the cooler
chromospheric regions (C ii lines). This would have to be exam-
ined further using a range of techniques including RH modelling
(Uitenbroek 2001).

Using an 82-minute sit-and-stare dataset, we were able to
analyse the shorter-scale evolution of super-sonic downﬂows
within the bright sunspot structure. The IRIS slit passed directly
through the northern end of the Si iv transition region brighten-
ing that hosted the super-sonic downﬂows analysed here, which
had no signature in the Mg ii ﬁlter, at a position where no super-
sonic downﬂows were detected in the previous raster (as shown
in Fig. 5). Initially, no downﬂow was apparent in the Si iv 1394 Å
spectra, however, after around 60 minutes a dual ﬂow developed
with an initial velocity of 73 km s−1. This downﬂow then acceler-
ated at a rate of 5 km s−2 over the course of the next 20 minutes
to a velocity of around 80 km s−1, similar to the acceleration
rate measured at the foot-point of a coronal loop (Chitta et al.
2016). In the O iv 1401 Å spectra, the downﬂow displayed simi-
lar behaviour during the same time period. It is unclear whether
this downﬂow becomes stable at some point (analogous to the
downﬂow studied by Straus et al. 2015) due to the end of the

Article number, page 10 of 11

sit-and-stare observation. It should be noted that no evidence of
this downﬂow is present in the raster following the sit-and-stare
indicating that it has a lifetime of only a few hours at most.

Now, we try to place our results in the context of current un-
derstanding of the transition region dynamics of sunspots. Al-
though the intensity of the line core is often larger than the
background intensity during these downﬂows, the speciﬁc cases
where the line core intensity is reduced (see Fig. 5), the preva-
lence of these signatures in the umbra, and the presence of the
secondary emission peak in the red wing appears to diﬀeren-
tiate the downﬂows studied here from bright dots (Tian et al.
2014b). The sustained nature of the super-sonic downﬂow in
the sit-and-stare observation, the relatively low downﬂow ve-
locity, and the lack of signature in the C ii 1335 Å and Mg ii
2796 Å lines for all but one of the detected dual ﬂows, also
makes it unlikely that these downﬂows are a result of bursty
events such as coronal rain (Kleint et al. 2014). The super-sonic
downﬂows reported here appear to be more similar in velocity
and spectral signature to the lower velocity downﬂows reported
in the IRIS literature by several authors (e.g., Tian et al. 2014a;
Straus et al. 2015; Chitta et al. 2016; Samanta et al. 2018). It has
been suggested that such dual ﬂow signatures in the transition re-
gion spectra could be caused by shocks from downﬂowing ma-
terial (Brynildsen et al. 2001), potentially, due to siphon ﬂows
(Cargill & Priest 1980). If this is the case then our results imply
that the conditions required for siphon ﬂows must be common
within ARs throughout their lifetimes.

5. Summary

Downﬂows of over 50 km s−1 were present within the lead
sunspot of AR 12526 in the Si iv 1394 Å line for 13 of the 16
raster datasets studied here (see Table 1). Super-sonic downﬂows
were present in the O iv 1401 Å line for 14 of these datasets. All
such downﬂows occurred co-spatial to a sustained transition re-
gion brightening, mapping the foot-points of coronal loops de-
tectable in the SDO/AIA 171 Å channel, stretching over the um-
bra and the penumbra. The spatial extents of the downﬂows in
the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv 1401 Å lines was often very diﬀer-
ent (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The three rasters which contained no
evidence of super-sonic downﬂows within the Si iv 1394 Å line
occurred following the formation of two lightbridges within the
umbra. Only one example of super-sonic downﬂows was de-
tected in the C ii 1335 Å line with a velocity 15 km s−1 larger than
the corresponding Si iv 1394 Å velocity. No downﬂows were de-
tected in the Mg ii 2796 Å line.

During the sit-and-stare sequence sampled on the 1st April
2016, no super-sonic downﬂow was initially present (Fig. 5 and
Fig. 7). However, a dual ﬂow did form around 60 minutes after
the start of the observation with an initial velocity of 73 km s−1
in the Si iv 1394 Å line. The velocity of this downﬂow then in-
creased at around 5 m s−2 over the course of the next 20 minutes
to give a ﬁnal velocity of close to 80 km s−1 (top panel of Fig. 7).
In the O iv 1401 Å line, the velocity accelerated at a similar rate
during the same time. No signature of this downﬂow was present
in either the C ii 1335 Å or Mg ii 2796 Å lines (Fig. 8). Aligning
the SJI images to SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI data allowed us to
infer that the brightening over which all super-sonic downﬂows
were detected in the rasters appeared to stretch over the northern
lightbridge at this time. Additionally, two distinct sets of coronal
fan loops were evident with one set appearing to be rooted to the

Nelson et al.: On-Set Of Super-Sonic Downﬂows In A Coronal Fan Loop

north of this lightbridge and one set appearing to be rooted south
of this lightbridge (Fig. 6).

Overall, our results indicate that super-sonic downﬂows
are highly irregular and intermittent over
the course of
both minutes and hours (agreeing with previous research by
Kjeldseth-Moe et al. 1988). The spatial locations and velocities
of these downﬂows, which are most easily detected in the red
wing of the Si iv 1394 Å and O iv 1401 Å lines, are often com-
pletely diﬀerent from one raster to the next, and from one spec-
tral window to another. Our analysis also suggests that super-
sonic downﬂows occur preferentially around bright regions at
the Si iv 1394 Å rest wavelength corresponding to the loca-
tions of foot-points of coronal loops. Finally, the intermittency
of super-sonic downﬂows implies that more sunspots than previ-
ously thought could host such events (i.e, more than the ∼ 80 %
reported by Samanta et al. 2018).
