Multiplicity ﬂuctuations in Ar+Sc collisions at the CERN
SPS from NA61/SHINE ∗

Andrey Seryakov for the NA61/SHINE Collaboration

St.Petersburg State University, Russia

Multiplicity ﬂuctuations were investigated in Ar+Sc collisions at 13A,
19A, 30A, 40A, 75A, 150A GeV/c using the NA61/SHINE detector at
the SPS. Centrality selection is based on the nucleon-spectator energy in
the forward hemisphere as measured by the Projectile spectator detector.
Preliminary results on the scaled variance ω and the strongly intensive
measure Ω were obtained for the multiplicity distribution of all, negatively
and positively charged hadrons. Results are discussed and compared with
p+p results and Pb+Pb data of NA49 and EPOS 1.99 simulations.

PACS numbers: 25.75.-q, 25.75.Gz, 25.75.Nq

1. Centrality determination in NA61/SHINE

Centrality is a key parameter in heavy ion collisions as it allows to re-
strict the volume of the created system. The classical deﬁnition of centrality
is based on impact parameter which is not directly measurable. Therefore
experiments use diﬀerent techniques to deﬁne centrality indirectly. The
most common method is to apply restrictions on the produced particle
multiplicity in some pseudorapidity intervals [1]. This deﬁnition possibly
biases multiplicity ﬂuctuation measurements. Therefore NA61/SHINE uses
for centrality determination information from a forward hadron colorimeter
PSD [2], which measures the energy of all non-interacted forward nucleons.

2. Fluctuation measures

Fluctuation quantities are studied to probe the critical point CP of
strongly interacting matter. The most widely used is the scaled variance of
the multiplicity distribution:

ω[N ] = ((cid:104)N 2(cid:105) − (cid:104)N (cid:105)2)/(cid:104)N (cid:105),

where (cid:104)· · ·(cid:105) stands for averaging over all events. Within the Wounded Nu-
cleon Model (WNM) or the ideal Boltzmann multi-component gas in the
grand canonical ensemble (IB-GCE) one can write [3]:

ω[N ] = ω[n] + ω[W ](cid:104)N (cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105),

(2)

where n is the multiplicity produced from one wounded nucleon or from a
ﬁxed volume (IB-GCE) and W is the number of wounded nucleons. To probe
the CP it is important to suppress the volume ﬂuctuation (ω[W ]). Therefore
the scaled variance should be measured for the most central collisions or
strongly intensive quantities should be used. In Refs. [3, 4] the following
measures were proposed:

∆[A, B] = 1
C∆

(cid:21)
(cid:20)
(cid:104)B(cid:105)ω[A] − (cid:104)A(cid:105)ω[B]

Σ[A, B] = 1
CΣ

(cid:20)
(cid:104)B(cid:105)ω[A] + (cid:104)A(cid:105)ω[B] − 2((cid:104)AB(cid:105) − (cid:104)A(cid:105)(cid:104)B(cid:105))

(cid:21)
,

(4)

where A and B are extensive quantities and C∆ and CΣ are normalization
coeﬃcients, which are chosen so that ∆ = Σ = 1 for the models of indepen-
dent particle production. A new quantity Ω [5] can be constructed from ∆
and Σ by setting C∆ = CΣ = (cid:104)B(cid:105):

Ω[A, B] = 1

2 (∆[A, B] + Σ[A, B]),

(5)

If A and B are uncorrelated from a ﬁxed volume within the IB-GCE or from
a single source then Ω[A, B] = ω[a], where ω[a] is ω[A] in the ﬁxed volume
or the scaled variance of A from a single source. Therefore for the most
central collisions one expects that Ω[A, B] ≈ ω[A].

3. Analysis procedure

Preliminary results were obtained from forward energy selected Ar+Sc
collisions at 19, 30, 40, 75 and 150A GeV/c respectively. The analy-
sis was performed in the NA61/SHINE acceptance with the restriction
0 < y∗
π < ybeam, where y∗ is the particle rapidity in the c.m.s. under
pion mass assumption. The rapidity cut was introduced to exclude regions
of poor azimuthal angle acceptance and electron contamination in backward
hemisphere and to reduce diﬀractive eﬀects in the forward region. Trans-
verse momenta of all charged particles were restricted to 0 < pT < 1.5
GeV/c. Event and track selection criteria were chosen to select only inelas-
tic interactions and hadrons produced in strong and EM processes. The p+p
data [6] shown for comparison were corrected for contributions from non-
target interactions, for Ar+Sc collisions these corrections were estimated to

be negligible. The results are corrected for detector ineﬃciencies and trigger
biases by multidimensional moments corrections for p+p collisions[6] and
by separate moments corrections for Ar+Sc collisions. The eﬀect of the
corrections on ω[N ] for Ar+Sc is shown in Fig. 1. Ω[N, EP ] is presented
in this paper without corrections. Statistical uncertainties were calculated
using the sub-sample method. Systematic uncertanties were estimated to be
less than 10%, further investigations will follow. The systematic uncertain-
ties are not shown in the ﬁgures. The centrality determination procedure in
EPOS 1.99 is based on the number of forward nucleon-spectators for correct
comparison between data and simulation.

Fig. 1. The eﬀect of correction procedure on ω[N ] of charged hadrons for the 0-5%
forward energy selected Ar+Sc data. The open dots are uncorrected data, the full
dots are corrected, the black line is the pure EPOS 1.99 simulation, the grey line
shows the EPOS 1.99 results after detector simulation and reconstruction. Results
are for 0 < yπ < ybeam and the NA61/SHINE acceptance.

4. Results

The energy dependence of the scaled variance of the multiplicity of all,
positively and negatively charged hadrons (ω[N ]) is shown in Figs. 1 and 2
for 0-5% and 0-0.2% forward energy selected Ar+Sc collisions. A small
enhancement at 8A GeV/c is observed for the most central collisions. As
EPOS1.99 simulations show the same behaviour it probably is an acceptance
eﬀect. The charged hadron multiplicity and the diﬀerence between the beam
energy and the forward energy measured by the PSD(EP = Ebeam − EP SD)
were chosen as variables for the Ω quantity as these values are uncorrelated
from the singe source for the independent particle production model. With
this assumption Ω[N, EP ] = ω[n] ≈ ω[N ] for the most central collisions. The
energy dependence of Ω[N, EP ] and ω[N ] for the 0.2% most central Ar+Sc
collisions are shown in the Fig. 3 and compared with ω[N ] for the p+p data.
There is no signiﬁcant non-monotonic behaviour in the energy dependence of
those two measures, however an interesting eﬀect was observed (see Fig. 4).

Fig. 3. The energy dependences of Ω[N, EP ] (red dots) and ω[N ] (blue triangles) for

Results are inside the NA61/SHINE acceptance and for 0 < yπ < ybeam and
0 < pT < 1.5 GeV/c.

Namely, for negatively charged hadrons (the cleanest sample) at 150/158A
GeV/c the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution is much below 1
for 0-0.2% Ar+Sc and 0-1% Pb+Pb and above 1 for p+p collisins. Within
the Wounded Nucleon Model (WNM) one expects that ω[N ]AA should be
grater or equal ω[N ]pp. Therefore, the result obtained by NA61/SHINE
and NA49 clearly shows the violation of the Wounded Nucleon Model in
these reactions. In the IB-GCE the multiplicity distribution is Poissonian
(ω[N ] = 1), independent of the (ﬁxed) system volume, and thus ω[N ]AA <
1 is forbidden. On the other hand, ω[N ] can increase due to resonance
decays and Bose-Einstein statistics and decrease due to conservation laws
[7]. In fact, the NA49 Pb+Pb point is very well described by the hadron
gas model in the micro canonical ensemble (HG-MCE) [7]. Within the
statistical models the result ω[N ] (cid:29) 1, as seen in p+p, can be understood
as a result of volume and/or energy ﬂuctuations [8]. Acknowledgments:
