The stereodynamics of the Ne(3P2)+Ar Penning and Associative ionization reactions have been
studied using a crossed molecular beam apparatus. The experiment uses a curved magnetic hexapole
to polarise the Ne(3P2) which is then oriented with a shaped magnetic ﬁeld in the region where
it intersects with a beam of Ar(1S). The ratios of Penning to associative ionization were recorded
over a range of collision energies from 320 cm−1 to 500 cm−1 and the data was used to obtain Ω
state dependent reactivities for the two reaction channels. These reactivities were found to compare
favourably to those predicted in the theoretical work of Brumer et al.

INTRODUCTION

Collision processes of electronically excited atoms have
long been used as rich systems to study elementary en-
ergy transfer processes. Two basic reaction channels are
available for energy disposal if the internal energy of the
excited atom A* is higher than the ionization energy of
another atom, B:

A∗ + B −→ A + B+ + e−

−→ AB+ + e−.

(2)

The ﬁrst of these reaction is called Penning ionization
(PI), the second is associative ionization (AI), also known
as the Hornbeck-Molnar process.[1]

A plethora of data is available for the PI channel.[2–7]
Quantities of physical relevance such as the state speciﬁc
total ionization cross sections and electron angular dis-
tributions have been obtained, yielding further insight
into the energy transfer process.[8–11, 13, 14] Later, it
was found that PI experiments are ideally suited for use
in very low collision energy experiments. The ionization
process is barrierless and the cross sections display res-
onances at low collision energy.[15] These cold collision
experiments have become a proving ground for ultracold
collision dynamics as the metastable atoms can be ma-
nipulated and controlled by external magnetic ﬁelds.[15–
18, 20]

The branching ratio between PI and AI has been inves-
tigated for a number of diﬀerent collision systems, and it
is found for most that the PI process is favoured.[7, 21, 22]
The PI channel is thought to dominate in the collisions
of rare gases due to the very weak bond formed between
bound state rare gas ions which typically only supports a
small number of bound rovibrational states.[3] One com-
pelling question that comes out of the competition be-
tween reactions 1 and 2 is how the angular momentum
polarization of the excited electron aﬀects the reaction
outcome. Both PI and AI involve a form of coupling be-
tween electronic states of the impinging A* and B, but
the exact dependence of the complexation mechanisms

on angular momentum have received scant attention in
the literature.[23]

Details of the collision process itself can be assessed
by controlling the spatial orientation of reactants and in-
vestigating the properties of the reaction products. The
study of stereodynamics can be experimentally realised
by orienting at least one of the reactants with inhomo-
geneous electric, magnetic or optical ﬁelds (See Ref. [24]
and citations therein). For example, by orienting a po-
larised reactant in a magnetic ﬁeld one sets the direction
of the magnetic moment (cid:126)µ. Since the relative spatial po-
sitions of (cid:126)µ and the angular momentum (cid:126)J vector are well
known, polarising the magnetic moment allows the keen
experimentalist to manipulate the relative populations of
states with diﬀerent projections of (cid:126)J, labeled Ω, on the
inter-atomic axis.

In the present experiment the branching ratio of AI
vs. PI in collisions of metastable Ne(3P2) (henceforth
designated as Ne*) with ground state Ar in a controlled
magnetic ﬁeld is investigated. This reaction, and specif-
ically the energy dependent branching ratio between AI
and PI has been at the focus of previous theoretical in-
vestigations concerning the question of coherent control
of the reaction.[25, 26] An important result from these
papers are the Ω-speciﬁc cross sections for AI and PI.
These results predict that the reactivities RΩ = σAI
Ω /σP I
Ω
are small and of similar magnitude for Ω =0 and Ω = 1
but larger for Ω = 2. No experimental evidence produced
until now could support this claim.

We here use a tuneable magnetic ﬁeld in the reaction
zone to orient the polarised Ne* exiting a curved hexapole
magnetic guide.[27, 28] The transmission probability for
the Ne* atoms in the guide depends on the magnetic
quantum number mJ (see supp. matt. and references
12 and 18 and 30). After exiting the guide, the Ne*
(cid:126)J adiabatically orients to the tuneable magnetic ﬁeld in
the scattering chamber. The oriented Ne* beam is then
crossed at right angles with a beam of ground state Ar
atoms leading to PI and AI of the Ar atom. The relative
intensities of the two resulting signals as a function of the
magnetic ﬁeld angle give access to the Ω state dependent

trometer and recorded as a function of orientation angle
and of collision energy.

The polarization of the Ne* sample is described using a
density matrix formalism giving the population of states
ordered by the quantum number mJ , the projection of
(cid:126)J on the magnetic ﬁeld axis.[31] For the collision pro-
cess itself, the relevant populations are those for states
labelled by Ω. The calculation of the populations pΩ is
obtained through a frame transformation from the lab-
oratory frame of reference into the molecular frame of
reference, using the externally deﬁned direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld and the relative velocity of Ar and Ne*.
Because the pmJ are ﬁxed by the guiding dynamics in
the curved magnetic hexapole, the rotation of the mag-
netic ﬁeld at constant relative velocity leads to diﬀerent
proportions of pΩ. By measuring relative cross sections
of PI and AI as a function of the ﬁeld direction and the
collision energy we make use of our complete control over
all degrees of freedom in the reaction and obtain a two-
dimensional reactivity map which is ﬁtted to energy- and
Ω-dependent reactivities RAI/PI(θ, E).

EXPERIMENTAL

elsewhere

The apparatus used here has been described in
context of merged-beam
detail
experiments.[17, 18, 32, 33] There are, however, a few
notable diﬀerences. Most importantly, the setup is oper-
ated in crossed-beam conﬁguration.

in the

A velocity-tuned supersonic expansion of Ne(3P2)
atoms is generated by a dielectric barrier discharge from
a temperature controlled Even-Lavie valve[34, 35] (repe-
tition rate 30 Hz; stagnation pressure 8 bar). Metastable
Ne atoms emerging from the discharge are skimmed
and enter a 1.8 m long curved magnetic guide. Only
the 3P2 state is suﬃciently long-lived and eﬃciently
guided in the magnetic ﬁeld and reaches the interac-
tion zone.[18, 19, 36] The valve temperature is controlled
through cooling with liquid nitrogen and heating with a
coil on the valve body. Mean beam velocities between
500 m s−1 and 800 m s−1 are obtained.

The Ne* beam crosses a skimmed, pulsed, super-
sonic expansion of Ar atoms, produced from a room-
temperature general valve operated with a backing pres-
sure of 2.5 bar, at ninety degrees in the center of the
magnet assembly shown in Fig. 1. Panel 1c shows the
arrangement of the two solenoid magnets, oriented at
ninety degrees with respect to each other and at 45 de-
grees to both beams, as shown in panel 1b.b The direction
of the ﬁeld is controlled by applying diﬀerent currents to
each of the solenoids in a manner that the amplitude at
the center is always ≈ 10 mT. For example, an angle of
θ = 0◦ is achieved by applying current only to the mag-
nets along the θ = 0◦ axis while equal current on both

ments of the degree of control using a CCD camera and
compass needle, as shown in Fig. 1b, have shown that
the ﬁeld direction can be repeatedly set with a precision
better than 5◦.

Collision products, Ar+ and NeAr+ are accelerated
in a ToF mass spectrometer and recorded separately on
an MCP detector. Signals from several thousand beam
pulses are accumulated at each orientation angle and Ne*
velocity.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig.

2a shows normalised time-of-ﬂight spectra for
the Ne*+Ar reaction recorded at a collision energy of
390 cm−1, as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld direction.
Each trace in Fig. 2a contains only the early Ar+ peak
and the later NeAr+ peak. The angle-dependent ratio
between these two peaks is plotted in Fig. 2b, which
thus shows σAI

The PI channel is maximised when the ﬁeld direction is
parallel to the relative velocity and AI is maximised when
the ﬁeld is perpendicular to the relative velocity. The

θkB is the angle between the interatomic velocity (cid:126)k and
the magnetic ﬁeld axis, σΩ
AI;PI are the Ω state depen-
dent cross sections of the PI or AI channel and pΩ(θkB)
the population of the Ω quantum number. The pΩ(θkB)
populations are not measured directly but are derived
from the pmJ that are deﬁned in the laboratory frame
and can be determined spectroscopically. These are then
transformed by a rotation of the reference frame from the
laboratory into the molecular frame, using the Wigner d-
matrices as detailed in the supplementary material.[37]
The pmJ were obtained by recording the 1+2 REMPI
signal of Ne(3P2) at ≈320 nm using linearly and circu-
larly polarised light, extracting polarization moments,
and transforming into state populations.[28, 29, 37, 38] A
plot of the experimental and ﬁtted REMPI signal inten-
sity for linearly polarised light as a function of the laser
polarization angle is shown in Fig. 1a. Here, the direc-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld was kept constant while the
laser polarization was rotated. An identical result was
obtained when keeping the laser polarization ﬁxed but
rotating the magnetic ﬁeld, demonstrating that the re-
orientation of the Ne* atoms in the magnetic ﬁeld indeed
is an adiabatic process that retains the pmJ populations.
The extracted state populations from the REMPI mea-
surements were determined to be p0 = 0.087 ± 0.015,
p1 = 0.75 ± 0.02 and p2 = 0.163 ± 0.025. These values
were found to change inappreciably over the Ne* velocity
range. The experimental ratio from Fig. 2c can be used
in conjunction with the above theoretical framework to
obtain relationships between the state dependent reac-
tivities, RΩ

AI/PI.

It is worth pointing out that the present measurements
of the AI/PI ratio do not yield absolute cross sections for

the PI and AI channels. This rules out the possibility of
directly solving equation 3 and prevents determination of
the absolute values of σΩ
AI;PI. Instead, we use the exper-
imental reactivities RAI/PI(θ, E) to extract the relevant
Ω dependent reactivities. The total reactivity is given as

and this is plotted, using the ﬁtted values, in Fig. 2d to
reproduce the experimental plot in panel 2c. The ﬁt was
obtained using a non-standard Monte-Carlo ﬁtting algo-
rithm, described in detail in the supplementary material.
Brieﬂy, the target function equation 4 for diﬀerent an-
gles and collision energies was ﬁtted to the experimental
results using the experimental populations pmJ , appro-
priate frame rotation, and adjusting the six cross sections
σΩ
AI;PI. This procedure provides the desired Ω-speciﬁc re-
activities σΩ
PI. As detailed in the supplementary ma-
terial, a direct ﬁt of these parameters is rendered diﬃcult
by the high degree of correlation between them.

AI/σΩ

To illustrate the quality of the ﬁt we show the best
result for the speciﬁc collision energy of 390 cm−1 in Fig.
2b. Energy and Ω dependent reactivities are shown in
Fig. 3. The results for Ω=0,1, and 2 are shown as black,
red, and blue traces, respectively. In each case the shaded
area shows the conﬁdence interval for the ﬁt (one stan-
dard deviation; see supplementary material for details).
Results from previous theoretical calculations of RΩ are
shown for reference in Fig. 3 for a collision energy of
1 kcal mol−1[25, 39] Satisfactory agreement is observed
in particular with regards to the similar reactivities R0

conﬁguration favours exchange and the internal energy
transfer from the excited electron to the bound rovibra-
tional states in the complex decides the cross section for
the AI and PI channel. When Ω = 0 or 1, the argon p
orbital overlaps less well with that of the neon p orbital
which suppresses complex formation.[9, 22] At long range
where Ω is not a good quantum number, the radiative
mechanism, leading to PI, is favoured. In this case there
is little chance of forming a bound state complex as the
ionization occurs before complexation can occur.[22, 43]
Justiﬁed by previous experimental results, calculations
have often neglected the radiative contribution.[40, 42]
However, our data suggests that this approximation may
not be valid under the present circumstances.

At the lowest collision energies sampled here, the AI
channel is increasing in importance for Ω = 0 and 1.
Since these quantum numbers mean that the singly oc-
cupied p orbital is not pointing toward the atom, this
trend may mean either that at these energies the long
range radiative mechanism is becoming less favoured, or
that at low collision energies the propensity for complex-
ation increases even though the orbital overlap is less
ideal. At higher collision energy, around 260 meV, the
AI channel disappears completely.[39] There, the energy
of the collision is so high that the complex can not form
any bound states, so even if the system proceeds through
the exchange mechanism and complexation, the only pos-
sible outcome is PI whose cross section is predicted to
steadily increase at higher collision energy. Calculations
predict that at ultracold temperatures the reaction is en-
tirely dominated by AI, meaning that the radiative pro-
cess should lose it’s importance entirely.[25] Stereoydy-
namics studies in a merged beams conﬁguration are now
planned to assess this and obtain reactivities in the cold
regime with a collision energy < 1 K.

CONCLUSIONS

The ratio of Penning to associative ionization for the
reaction of Ne*+Ar across the energy range 320 cm−1 to
500 cm−1 has been measured using a crossed-beam ap-
paratus. The experimental results provide ratios of state
dependent cross sections which have been shown to agree
favourably with theory. The Penning process is preferred
across the energy range and becomes ever more dominant
as the collision energy increases, the probability of form-
ing a complex below the dissociation threshold dimin-
ishes as the collision energy is increased as the ionised
complex can not support a large number of rovibrational
levels. The state dependent cross sections do not show
large variation across the collision energy range. At the
lowest collision energies sampled the importance of the
Ω = 2 channel diminishes as the proportion of AI in the
total ionization cross section increases. The importance
of the Ω = 2 channel for AI agrees favourably with the

FIG. 4. Cartoons for the postulated mechanisms: radiative
mechanism (top), operates at long range and leads to PI; ex-
change mechanism (bottom) operates at close range and leads
to AI and PI. At long range Ω is not a good quantum number
and the radiative mechanism has similar cross sections for all
Ω states; higher cross sections for Ω = 2 are predicted for the
exchange mechanism.

and R1 in comparison with R2.

Two independent reaction mechanisms have been pro-
posed which can result in either PI or AI, these are
shown pictorially in Fig. 4. The Ω dependent reactiv-
ities shed light on the relative importance of each mech-
anism for forming either the AI or PI products. The two
competing pathways, with a diﬀerent orientation depen-
dence, are referred to as the radiative and the exchange
mechanisms.[3, 22] The exchange mechanism (bottom il-
lustration in Fig. 4), believed to be dominant in the
Ne*+Ar collision, involves the outer p electron of Ar be-
ing transferred to the vacant p orbital of Ne* and causing
the ejection of the Penning electron.[40, 41] This mech-
anism requires orbital overlap between the partially oc-
cupied Ne* p orbital and a p orbital of the Ar. Thus, it
is important particularly at short interatomic distances.
Favourable orientation of the singly occupied p-orbital
in Ne* with respct to the Ar makes this process more
eﬃcient for Ω=2 projections than for Ω=0 and 1.

In the radiative mechanism (upper illustration in Fig.
4) the Ne* s electron transfers to its p orbital which leads
to ionization of Ar through a long range coupling.
[22,
42] The radiative process can also occur at long range
where the system is best described as a Hund’s case (e)
and Ω is not a good quantum number, the orientation
of the orbital in this mechanism is therefore expected
to be unimportant.[22] While the exchange mechanism
proceeds through a complex and thus can lead to AI,
the radiative mechanism results exclusively in PI. The
relative reactivities therefore contain information about
the importance of the long and short range mechanisms
on the ion yield of PI and AI.

We ﬁnd experimentally that for Ω = 2 (p orbital
pointing towards Ar atom), AI has approximately equal
cross section to that of PI across the energy range
(σΩ=2
In this conﬁguration, as shown in
the bottom panel of Fig. 4, the Ne* and Ar atoms can
undergo complexation through the exchange mechanism.
