Abstract. A cryogenic radio-frequency ion trap system designed for quantum logic
spectroscopy of highly charged ions is presented. It includes a segmented linear Paul
trap, an in-vacuum imaging lens and a helical resonator. We demonstrate ground
state cooling of all three modes of motion of a single 9Be+ ion and determine their
heating rates as well as excess axial micromotion. The trap shows one of the lowest
levels of electric ﬁeld noise published to date. We investigate the magnetic-ﬁeld noise
suppression in cryogenic shields made from segmented copper, the resulting magnetic
ﬁeld stability at the ion position and the resulting coherence time. Using this trap in
conjunction with an electron beam ion trap and a deceleration beamline, we have been
able to trap single highly charged Ar13+ (Ar XIV) ions concurrently with single Be+
ions, a key prerequisite for the ﬁrst quantum logic spectroscopy of a highly charged
ion.

1. Introduction

Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in high precision spectroscopy
of highly charged ions (HCI) for applications in frequency metrology and fundamental
physics [1, 2], such as the search for a possible variation of fundamental constants
[3, 4, 5, 6], violation of local Lorentz invariance [7], or probing for new long-range
interactions [8]. The strong scaling of energy levels with charge state shifts ﬁne and
hyperﬁne transitions into the optical regime [1, 9, 5], enabling high-precision laser
spectroscopy. The highest sensitivity to many of the tests of fundamental physics
can be found in optical transitions between levels of diﬀerent electronic conﬁguration
near energy-level crossings as a function of charge state [10]. The small size of

electron orbitals in HCI and correspondingly reduced atomic polarisability and electric
quadrupole moment, suppresses ﬁeld-induced systematic frequency shifts, suggesting
HCI as favourable optical clock candidates [3, 11, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15].

Up to now, precision spectroscopy of HCI at rest was mostly performed in electron
beam ion traps (EBITs). However, high ion temperatures (T > 105 K) due to the
electron impact heating in a deep trapping potential and magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneities
as well as drifts have limited the achievable spectroscopic resolution and accuracy in
most cases to the parts-per-million level. Recently, the transfer of HCI from an EBIT
to a Paul trap and sympathetic cooling to millikelvin temperatures using co-trapped
laser-cooled Coulomb crystals was demonstrated [16]. Combined with ultrastable local
oscillator technology [17, 18] and the techniques used in optical frequency standards
based on quantum logic [19, 20], this paves the way for a 109 to 1013-fold improvement
over the current most accurate spectroscopic measurements for HCI [21, 22].

Currently there are only two approaches for high-precision optical spectroscopy of
HCI. One is the use of Penning traps, where a single HCI is trapped and resistively
cooled to the temperature of the cryogenic ion trap [23, 24]. Successful laser-induced
excitation of the transition is detected by electronic readout of the ion spin by coupling
it to its motion in an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [25]. The other approach, followed
by this experiment, is based on the detection of Rabi ﬂopping on the spectroscopy HCI
using a co-trapped singly-charged ion such as 9Be+, which also provides sympathetic
cooling. Optical excitation of the HCI is transferred to the Be+ ion exploiting the
coupled motion of the ions using well-established quantum logic protocols [19]. Then,
the excitation of the Be+ ion is read out by ﬂuorescence detection.

The HCI lifetime in a trap is limited by charge-exchange reactions with background
gas particles. For frequency metrology, useful lifetimes in the minutes to hours regime
can only be achieved in cryogenic environments with pressure levels of typically below
10−14 mbar [26, 27, 28]. Here, a cryogenic ion trap setup including a newly designed
segmented blade trap, an in-vacuum helical resonator and a imaging system with high
collection eﬃciency is presented. The segmented blade trap is characterised in terms of
ion heating rates and excess axial micromotion. Furthermore, ground state cooling of
all three normal modes of motion of a single Be+ ion conﬁned far outside the Lamb-
Dicke regime is demonstrated. The magnetic shielding due to the cryogenic heat shields
and the corresponding passive stability of the magnetic ﬁeld is evaluated. We report
on measurements of the coherence time and suppression of low-frequency magnetic ﬁeld
noise. Finally, we demonstrate the successful loading and storage of a single ion of Ar13+
(Ar XIV).

The entire system is inspired by [26] and has consequently been named "Cryogenic
Paul Trap Experiment PTB" (CryPTEx PTB). Compared to [26] our much smaller trap
size yields higher secular frequencies, which are required for high-ﬁdelity quantum logic
operations [29]. Furthermore, the trap is connected to a low-vibration cryogenic supply
line [30] and a compact EBIT producing the desired HCI [31].

text. The in-vacuum imaging system is not shown.

2. Apparatus

Cryogenic quadrupole-Paul traps already exist in several laboratories around the world,
mainly as surface-electrode ion traps [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. There, a suppression of
the anomalous heating rates due to reduced electric ﬁeld noise is exploited [37, 32].
Macroscopic cryogenic Paul traps are in use for reaching extremely low pressures[26, 28],
serving as a reservoir for buﬀer-gas cooling of molecules [38], or reducing black-body
radiation shifts in optical clocks [39]. The setup presented here is the ﬁrst cryogenic
Paul trap designed for sub-Hz-level spectroscopy of optical transitions in HCI.

The lifetime of trapped HCI depends on the mean free time between collisions with
the background gas. Due to the keV-level ionisation potential of HCI, collisions of that
type will likely result in charge exchange between the HCI and the neutral partner.
This can cause HCI ejection from the trap, which typically has a depth of only a few
eV/charge in the axial direction. Even if the ion is retained after the charge-exchange
event, it does not longer belong to the required spectroscopic species, i. e., charge state,
and must be replaced. With cryopumping, pressures of less than 10−16 mbar can be
achieved [40]. As a comparison, most atomic physics experiments operate at pressures
of 10−11 mbar or above at room temperature.

2.1. Cryogenic setup

In addition to the usual requirements, the design of a cryogenic ion trap for frequency
metrology calls for:

(i) Extremely stable cold trap mounting inside the room-temperature vacuum cham-

ber, while thermally insulating the cold stages;

(ii) Multiple optical ports for lasers, imaging, and external ion delivery while keeping

blackbody radiation (BBR) heat load from outside as low as possible;

(iii) Electrical connections, including the radio-frequency drive, should use long cables

with very low thermal conductivity;

(iv) Repeated thermal cycling needed without trap damage or misalignment relative to

the external optical setup;

(v) Vibrations generated at the liquid-helium cryostat or the mechanical cryocooler

need to be suppressed at the position of the ion trap.

The ion trap setup is attached to a closed-cycle low-vibration cryogenic system, reaching
temperatures of < 5 K and 50 K on the cold stage and heat shield, respectively, despite
the ∼ 1.4 m separation from the cold head [30]. It suppresses the pulse tube vibrations
to values below 20 nm in the horizontal plane spanned by the laser beams and below
100 nm in the vertical direction. Figure 1 shows a CAD cross-sectional view of the setup.
It consists of a nested structure of temperature stages, each mounted symmetrically to
the previous one using ∼ 15 cm-long stainless-steel spokes to minimise heat conduction
between them in spite of the rigid mechanical connection. The vacuum chamber is ﬁxed
on the optical table, where the laser setup rests. Both the heat shield and the cold stage
consist of a base plate, a wide tube and a lid made of high-purity (99.99 %), gold-plated
oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper. Gold plating both enhances the thermal
conductivity at contact points and prevents tarnishing of the copper during periods
when the system is vented, thus maintaining a low emissivity in order to reduce heat
transfer via BBR. A wall thickness of 15 mm on the heat shield and 10 mm on the cold
stage eﬃciently shield external AC electromagnetic ﬁelds, and particularly well at low
temperatures, where the electrical conductivity of the copper is two orders of magnitude
higher than at room temperature. Convenient access to the inside of the cold stage is
provided by just removing three lids, allowing maintenance work without detaching the
cryogenic setup.

Symmetric arrangement of the stainless steel spokes, as in reference [26, 30],
minimises displacements during thermal cycling. After a complete thermal cycle, the
trapped ions can be optically addressed without realignment of the lasers or imaging
system. Optical access is provided by 16 ports, 12 of which are equally spaced in the

A cryogenic radio-frequency ion trap for quantum logic spectroscopy of highly charged ions5

horizontal plane. Four additional ports are provided at 15◦ oﬀ the horizontal plane,
spanning a vertical plane with the trap axis. The ports restrict the solid angle using
two nested concentric, 5 cm-long aluminium tubes on the cold stage and heat shield with
an inner diameter of 5 mm and 11 mm respectively. This minimises both the exposure of
the cold stage to room-temperature BBR and the ﬂux of residual-gas particles into the
cold stage, thereby enhancing diﬀerential pumping from the room-temperature sections.
The solid angle fraction of room-temperature elements visible to the ion is only 0.01 %,
which improves upon the ∼ 2 % reported previously [26].

All necessary DC electrical connections are provided by means of 2 m-long
phosphor-bronze wires with a diameter of 200 µm (Lakeshore QT-32), thermally
anchored at the heat shield and cold stage with 1 m of wire between the diﬀerent
temperature stages to reduce the thermal ﬂow to the trap electrodes. For the trap drive
radio-frequency (RF) signal and a microwave antenna, designed to drive the 1.25 GHz
Be+ ground state hyperﬁne structure splitting, we use semi-rigid coaxial beryllium-
copper wire (Coax Co., SC-219/50-SB-B).

The estimated heat load of the ion trap setup onto the cryostat is given in table 1.
It is apparent, that the heat load on the cold stage is dominated by room-temperature
BBR, while the heat load onto the cold stage is dominated by the dissipated RF power
of the ion trap and thermal conduction through mechanical and electrical connections.

2.2. The ion trap

Our present design meets the requirements for quantum logic spectroscopy of HCI. The
most important design goals were:

(i) low diﬀerential contraction between parts when cooling the trap to 4 K;

(ii) wide axial access and large trap aperture for eﬃcient injection of HCI from the

deceleration beamline;

(iii) a long axial trap for conﬁning Coulomb crystals of several hundred Be+ ions capable

of eﬃciently stopping the HCI after injection;

(iv) small RF electrode separations causing high secular frequencies needed for quantum

logic spectroscopy.

A cryogenic radio-frequency ion trap for quantum logic spectroscopy of highly charged ions6

To meet the ﬁrst criterium, the trap consists of alumina (sintered Al2O3), with adequate
thermal conductivity at both room and cryogenic temperatures of 30 and 0.3 W/(m · K)
[41], respectively, and a low RF loss tangent of 2 · 10−4 [42]. Our geometry is inspired
by a segmented blade design [43], however, the end caps are removed from the axis
[44, 45, 46]. Instead, the DC blades are segmented into ﬁve separate electrodes, whereby
radially opposing electrodes can be biased to provide axial conﬁnement. This breaks the
cylindrical symmetry of the trap, lifting the degeneracy of the radial secular motional
frequencies into a focused and de-focused mode and thus strongly deﬁning the principal
radial axes of the trap to be along the blade axes. This ensures eﬃcient cooling of all
ion motional modes by laser beams at oblique angles in the horizontal plane. A 0.9 mm
ion-electrode distance guarantees suﬃcient axial access for HCI injection while taking
advantage of the strong inverse scaling of the anomalous ion-heating rate on the ion-
electrode characteristic distance d (between d−2 and d−4, depending on the nature of
the noise source [47]).

To avoid a direct line-of-sight from the ion to the insulator separating the DC
electrodes, small slits with a width and depth of 100 µm are ﬁrst cut into the blades at the
desired electrode boundaries using a dicing saw. The electrode surfaces carry a 20 µm-
thick gold layer. At ﬁrst, a 20 nm-thick titanium seed layer and a 100 nm-thick gold
layer were deposited on the alumina substrate using the multi-directional evaporation
technique at the PTB surface-technology laboratory. Thereafter, a 20 µm-thick layer
of gold was galvanically grown at the PTB clean-room facilities. This thickness was
chosen to exceed the skin depth of the RF frequency drive (15 µm at 24 MHz at room
temperature, decreasing to 1.5 µm at 4 K for a residual-resistivity ratio (RRR) of 100).
The gold layer thickness was measured before and after the galvanic gold deposition
using an optical microscope. After that, gold standing between the individual electrodes
on the DC blade was removed by femtosecond-laser cutting at an external company
(Micreon GmbH). Slits were also cut into the RF-carrying blades in the same pattern
as in the DC blades to minimize axial micromotion [48], however they were not laser-
structured.

The fully assembled trap is mounted on a gold-coated alumina carrier board, which
provides the RF and DC electrical ground. The carrier board also features a Rogers
4350B printed-circuit board (PCB) with surface-mounted device (SMD) ﬁlter elements
and solder patches to connect to the DC blades, see ﬁgure 2. This provides a short
path between ﬁlters and electrodes, reducing noise pickup. Additionally, mounting the
ﬁlter components on the cold stage greatly reduces their Johnson noise. Connections
from this ﬁlter board to the trap electrodes were made of Kapton-insulated copper
wire, soldered at both ends using UHV compatible solder. The dielectric material of
the SMD capacitors (Vishay VJ1206A472FF) is class C0G, proven to work at cryogenic
temperatures with a sub-percent change in capacitance from room temperature [49]. All
components were selected to be non-magnetic, including the Rogers PCB, which uses
pure silver layers as conductor instead of the standard copper-nickel-gold combination.

The output voltage is optimised for a given level of power dissipation when there is a

(1 MΩ, Vishay PNM1206E1004BST) and capacitors (4.7 nF) were selected to build a
single-stage low-pass ﬁlter with a cutoﬀ frequency of 34 Hz. For the outermost blade
electrodes 1 kΩ resistors of the same series were chosen, increasing the cutoﬀ frequency
to 34 kHz to enable faster voltage switching whilst maintaining a low impedance for the
RF pickup.

The trap assembly is mounted on an OFHC copper block together with the imaging
lens and ion-optic electrodes, see ﬁgure 3. The ion trap is driven by a miniature OFHC
copper helical resonator placed next to the trap on the cold stage. The resonator
coil is inductively coupled to a primary coil connected to an ampliﬁed low-noise signal
generator (Rhode & Schwarz SML01) using a resistive beryllium-copper coaxial cable
and an insulated SMA connector feedthrough. For the resonator design we follow
reference [50] for a room-temperature, unloaded quality factor Q ≈ 700. It provides an
unloaded resonance frequency near 50 MHz, and after loading with the trap electrodes
24.1 MHz. We monitor the value of Q as a function of temperature during a thermal cycle
using a network analyser: At room temperature, Q = 230, and increases to Q = 385
when cooled to 4.5 K as shown in ﬁgure 4. This increase is much smaller than predicted
based on to the RRR values of copper and gold, and shows a saturation behaviour
starting at a temperature of around 50 K. This could be due to losses in the solder
joints or the PTFE former around which the secondary coil is wound.

By purposefully degrading the impedance matching between the primary and
secondary coils, the mutual inductance of the resonator coils is reduced [51], increasing
Q. The voltage on the secondary coil scales with
Q · Pin, where Pin is the coupled
power. Figure 4 (b) shows Q and the calculated resonator output voltage as a function
of Pin. We ﬁnd that the output voltage for a given power dissipated in the resonator
exhibits a maximum at slightly below 90 % coupling. This is a relevant ﬁgure of merit in
cryogenic systems only, where the dissipated power in the resonator can be the dominant
heat load for the cold stage. Additionally, higher Q leads to more eﬀective ﬁltering of
noise on the trap- drive signal, reducing ion heating through parametric excitation

[52, 53].

For the ﬁnal deceleration step of the HCI before they are loaded into the trap,
we bias the whole trap to +200 V. This potential is added to the signal wire of the
beryllium-copper coaxial cable using a bias-tee, keeping the shield of the helical resonator
electrically isolated from the cold stage. A capacitor insulates the shield of the coaxial
cable from the primary coil of the helical resonator. All other voltages required for ion
trapping are referenced to this bias potential, which can be adjusted without aﬀecting
the trap operation.

2.3. Loading and cooling of 9Be+

9Be+ ions are loaded into the trap by pulsed laser ablation and two-step photoionisation
with a resonant intermediate level [54]. A Q-switched frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser
at 532 nm with a pulse length of 4 ns and energy of up to 10 mJ is focused to a 1/e2
waist of 120 µm onto a beryllium wire located 18 mm from the trap centre. Ablated
beryllium atoms are ionised using a 235 nm laser tuned to the 1S0 – 1P1 transition
[55]. Typically, two laser pulses separated by 0.5 s are used for ablation, with a peak
laser energy density of approximately 1.2 J/cm2 for single ion loading and 4 J/cm2 for
loading of tens of ions, corresponding to peak intensities of around 300 MW/cm2 and
1000 MW/cm2 respectively.

For secular motional frequencies of a single 9Be+ ion of 2.5 MHz in the radial
direction and 1 MHz in the axial direction, 8 V have to be applied to the trap endcaps
at an RF power of 200 mW. The RF-power dissipation raises the temperature of the
cold stage by 0.3 K.

The ions are Doppler cooled on the strong, cycling 2S1/2 (F = 2) to 2P3/2 (F = 3)
transition using a laser with a wavelength of 313 nm [56, 55]. To lift the degeneracy of
the Zeeman sublevels and deﬁne the quantisation axis, a bias magnetic ﬁeld of 160 µT is
applied at an angle of 30° to the trap axial direction in the horizontal plane using three
mutually orthogonal pairs of coils. The cooling laser is delivered along the magnetic
bias ﬁeld axis with circular polarisation, as the cooling transition is closed for pure
σ-polarised light. Residual polarisation impurities optically pump the ion to the 2S1/2
(F = 1) state, from which they are repumped with a separate laser tuned to the 2S1/2
(F = 1) to 2P1/2 (F = 2) transition. This beam is collinear to and has the same
polarisation as the cooling laser.

A third 313 nm laser with a red detuning of 103 GHz to the cooling laser allows
driving stimulated Raman transitions between the ground state hyperﬁne levels, used
for ground-state cooling using resolved sidebands [57, 58] and quantum logic operations
[19]. A set of three Raman beams enables cooling and logic operations with projection
purely onto either the axial or radial direction as necessary. The linear polarisation of
each of the Raman beams was carefully tuned in order to minimise associated Stark
shifts, albeit at the cost of reduced Rabi frequencies [59]. For a single ion cooled to the
motional ground state, carrier (ﬁrst blue sideband) π-times of approximately 13 (15) µs

A cryogenic radio-frequency ion trap for quantum logic spectroscopy of highly charged ions10

and 5 (23) µs in the axial and radial directions respectively are achieved with 1 mW of
light per beam focused to a waist of 40 µm. The laser systems were set up following
reference [56], except the repumper laser which is based on a frequency doubled DBR
diode laser [60]. To ensure long-term alignment of the laser beams onto the ion, all
313 nm beams are delivered to the trap through hydrogen-loaded, large mode area
optical ﬁbres which have a typical transmission of 50 % for 1.5 m length [61, 62].

The relatively low secular frequencies somewhat complicate ground-state cooling
of the ion, in particular in the axial direction where the Lamb-Dicke parameters for
spontaneous emission and stimulated Raman excitation are 0.48 and 0.82, respectively.
However, we can exploit this large value for Raman excitation by utilising the high
strength of higher-order red sidebands. Several phonons can be removed at once to
counteract the eﬀect of recoil heating [58, 63, 64]. The cooling process is split into
two stages. First, a pre-cooling step consisting of 15 interleaved pulses on each of
the ﬁfth, fourth and third red sidebands is applied. This interleaving prevents optical
pumping of the ion into "trap" Fock states that have near-zero excitation probability
on a particular red sideband. Simulations indicate that this pre-cooling leaves negligible
population in Fock states higher than n = 3. Then, the ﬁnal cooling step comprises 10
interleaved pulses on each of the second and ﬁrst order red sidebands. For simplicity,
all pulses have the same power and duration, judiciously chosen to match a π-pulse on
the n = 1 → n(cid:48) = 0 transition. In this manner, we are able to reach within 1.8 ms
an axial mode ground-state probability of 98 % with a total of 65 red sideband pulses.
The ground state population is calculated using the sideband asymmetry after sideband
cooling, see ﬁgure 5.

For radial Raman excitation, the Lamb-Dicke parameter is 0.21, and there are no
signiﬁcant Fock states for which the coupling to red sidebands of a certain order is
vanishing. Hence, 20 interleaved sideband pulses on each of the second and ﬁrst order
red sidebands are applied.

2.4. Imaging system

Fluorescence of the Be+ ions on the cooling transition at 313 nm is imaged onto
an electron-multiplying CCD camera (Andor iXon3 DU885-KC-VP) and a photon-
multiplier tube (PMT, Hamamatsu H10682-210). The ﬂuorescence is split 1:99 between
camera and PMT for simultaneous observation of the ion position and its electronic
state.

The ﬁrst imaging lens is a custom bi-aspheric lens (Asphericon) mounted inside the
cold stage. It has a free aperture diameter of 22 mm and a working distance of 20 mm.
Given its numerical aperture of ∼ 0.5, it covers 6.9 % of the total solid angle around the
ion. Taking the dipole pattern of circularly polarised spontaneous emission into account
reduces the collection eﬃciency to 5.5 %.

At cryogenic temperatures, the imaging lens focus must be corrected for thermal
contraction. For this purpose the lens is installed in a stress-free copper holder which

and the radial modes (b) of a 9Be+ ion. The black data points were taken with a
Doppler-cooled ion, the red data points after ground state cooling.

is in turn mounted onto a piezo-electric translation stage (Attocube Anz101) to adjust
the focal distance. To minimise the size of the viewing apertures in the cold stages,
the lens relays a near-diﬀraction-limited image with a magniﬁcation of ×3 at the exit
of a tube analogous to those for the laser beams. This - only slightly magniﬁed - image
appears close to a re-entrant room-temperature viewport. It is then further magniﬁed
by an air-side lens doublet consisting of an oﬀ-the-shelf aspheric lens and a standard
plano-convex lens, leading to a total magniﬁcation of ×22.

With the the laser tuned to resonance and a heavily saturated cooling transition,
we observe a ﬂuorescence rate of 340 counts/ms from a single ion, a mere 50 % of the
predicted value including expected losses and the speciﬁed PMT quantum eﬃciency.
This could be due to residual misalignment and surface imperfections of the optical
elements. For Doppler cooling and state detection we work with an on-resonance count
rate of 60 counts/ms, corresponding to 0.2 times the saturation intensity. In this way
we prevent saturation broadening that would aﬀect the ion temperature after Doppler
cooling and reduce state detection errors due to oﬀ-resonant depumping of the F = 1
state during detection of the ion internal state. At this rate, and inserting a pinhole
of 1 mm diameter in front of the PMT for blocking stray light, the total background-
count rate (including approximately equal contributions from the PMT dark current
and laser scatter) is 2.1 counts/s. Therefore, the signal-to-background ratio reaches a
value of 28,500. We discriminate between |↓(cid:105) and |↑(cid:105) states (see ﬁgure 8) by counting
ﬂuorescence photons during a ﬁxed time (200 µs) induced by a resonant beam connecting
the 2S1/2 (F = 2) manifold to the P3/2 manifold and applying a standard thresholding
technique [65]. At the given detection eﬃciency, the state-discrimination ﬁdelity is
limited to 98 % by oﬀ-resonant depumping of the dark state |↑(cid:105) [66].

3. Trap characterisation

3.1. Heating rates

The low mass of 9Be+ and the high charge state of a HCI make both species highly
susceptible to electric ﬁeld noise on the trap electrodes, which leads to ion heating and
thus higher temperatures after laser cooling. It will also cause systematic shifts of the
clock resonance during interrogation if continuous cooling is not applied [67]. In view
of the favorable scaling of the heating rate with the secular frequency [68], it would
be desirable to operate with the tightest possible conﬁnement of the ion. However, to
minimise the RF power dissipated in the cold stages and thus achieve the lowest possible
temperature of those parts, the opposite becomes true, and we therefore work with
the weakest possible ion conﬁnement which still allows motional ground state cooling.
Hence, it is important to minimise electric ﬁeld noise as far as possible.

Measurements of the heating rate were carried out by initialising a single 9Be+ ion
in the ground state of one or more of its motional modes, then all lasers are turned oﬀ
to allow the ion to heat freely during periods of up to 200 ms. The ﬁnal ground-state
population was then determined by evaluating the asymmetry of the ﬁrst order blue and
red sidebands of the mode of interest [68]. From this, the heating rate was determined
to be 2.3(1) phonons/s in the axial mode at a frequency near 1.0 MHz, and 0.7(2) and
1.9(3) phonons/s for the two radial modes with frequencies near 2.2 MHz (de-focused)
and 2.5 MHz (focused) as shown in ﬁgure 6. This corresponds to an electric ﬁeld noise
spectral density (in units of 10−15 V2m−2Hz−1) of 3.6(2) for the axial direction and
2.6(7) and 7.1(11) for the radial directions. Such values compare well to other cryogenic
traps of this size and are between one and two orders of magnitude lower than in traps
of similar designs that are operated at room temperature [69].

we scan the RF-drive power. The observed heating rate in quanta per second was
independent of the secular frequency over the range 1.9 to 3.2 MHz. Noise with an f 1
spectrum, or residual uncompensated RF electric ﬁeld at the position of the ion could
explain this eﬀect.

Strong ﬁltering of the DC voltages did not aﬀect the anomalous heating rate in
the axial direction. Unexpectedly, it was observed that it increased with growing RF
drive power, though the radial and axial directions should be mutually independent.
In conjunction with the observed independence of the radial heating rate from the RF-
trap depth, this indicates that the heating rate in this mode is also limited by RF-drive
noise. This couples to the ion through the residual axial RF electric ﬁeld and causes
parametric excitation of the intrinsic micromotion sidebands [53]. A further reduction
of the heating rate could therefore be achieved by means of a helical resonator with
a higher loaded Q factor thus improving electronic ﬁltering and causing higher trap
frequencies for a given level of RF-power dissipation.

3.2. Micromotion

If the ion is displaced from the RF nodal line of the trap, or if any on-axis RF ﬁeld
component is induced by electrode alignment inaccuracies, ion motion will be driven at
the RF frequency, an eﬀect known as excess micromotion. This is expected to dominate
the error budget of an optical frequency standard based on HCI [1].

During curing of the glue holding the various trap parts together, an axial
misalignment of approximately 15 µm developed between the blade pairs, a value greater
than machining tolerances of 5 µm for the individual parts.

We measured the axial micromotion with the resolved sideband method [70, 71]
for a radial conﬁnement of νr = 1.5 MHz for a single 9Be+ ion. Figure 7 shows the
axial micromotion-induced time-dilation shift as a function of the axial position in the
trap given relative to the ion position for symmetric voltages on the DC electrodes. We
sweeped over the entire central segment length under stable trapping conditions. Only
a small variation of the micromotion amplitude along the axis was observed, with no
zero-crossing of the RF electric ﬁeld amplitude along the axis. The observed modulation
index for the central position was β = 1.5. With a 10 % error in the determination of
the sideband-Rabi frequencies, a fractional time-dilation shift error on the order of 10−17
is estimated for 9Be+.

3.3. Magnetic ﬁeld stability

Figure 8 shows a partial term scheme of the 9Be+ ion, with the hyperﬁne and
Zeeman structure in the 2S1/2 ground state. Under an external magnetic bias ﬁeld
of about 160 µT, we measure the magnetic ﬁeld at the position of the ion by
means of microwave spectroscopy on the ﬁrst order magnetic ﬁeld-sensitive transition
|↓(cid:105) = |F = 2, mF = −2(cid:105) to |↑(cid:105) = |F = 1, mF = −1(cid:105). The linear Zeeman shift of
∆ν/B = (3/2)µB/h (cid:39) 21 Hz/nT leads to a transition frequency of 1253.366 MHz.

.

Since the hyperﬁne constant of Be+ is known to a precision of 10−11 with A =
−625 008 837.048(10) Hz [72], we can calculate the linear and quadratic Zeeman shift
from the observed splitting between |↓(cid:105) and |↑(cid:105), which will subsequently be referred to
as the qubit transition.

Despite the lack of magnetic shielding around the vacuum chamber, the short-term
stability of the magnetic ﬁeld at the ion position is improved by the two, at 50 K and
4.5 K highly conductive, copper thermal shields. Alternating magnetic ﬁelds induce
eddy currents, suppressing magnetic ﬁeld changes inside the shields [73]. Assuming a
low-pass ﬁltering eﬀect of ﬁrst order, the decay time of these currents gives the corner
frequency of the ﬁlter function. Although one could expect a double-exponential decay
due to the two nested shielding layers, our measurements are compatible with a single
low-pass behaviour.

We measured the ring-down time by observing the step response of the Zeeman
splitting for current steps on the magnetic ﬁeld coils in all three principal axes: x,
horizontal direction perpendicular to the trap axial direction; y, vertical; z, trap axial
direction. In order to observe the frequency change of the Zeeman splitting we produced
an error signal applying two-point sampling with a linear range matched to the observed
frequency shift. Several up and down steps in current were applied, and the exponential
rise times averaged.

Symmetry suggests that the shielding eﬀect in both horizontal directions is identical.
In the vertical direction the shielding should be better as there are solid horizontal
OFHC-copper parts close to and aligned concentrically to the ion position. Shielding
in both horizontal directions however suﬀer from the contact resistances between base,
wall and lid elements. Experimental data conﬁrmed these considerations. Table 2 shows
the derived time constants and corresponding corner frequencies for the three diﬀerent
principal axis. Within statistics, the values along x and z are the same and about half
the one in y direction.

Complementary measurements of the shielding factor at higher frequencies were
obtained by applying an alternating current to another magnetic coil pair placed
outside the main coil set, with the magnitude of the applied ﬁeld determined using
a magnetic ﬂux sensor next to the vacuum chamber. The noise at the ion position
was spectroscopically measured using the quantum lock-in ampliﬁer technique [74], and
indicated a shielding factor of 30-40 dB at frequencies between 60 Hz and 1 kHz.

For evaluation of the low-frequency temporal stability of the magnetic bias ﬁeld,
a closed-loop frequency measurement of the qubit transition was carried out. The
microwave power and interaction time were matched to produce a linewidth of 100 Hz
with 98 % contrast using Rabi excitation. With the two-point sampling method, an
error signal was created that steered the microwave source.

It was found that, occasionally, changes of up to 50 nT occurred in the ﬁeld on
time scales of several seconds. This was traced down to the motion of an elevator
in the building. To compensate for this, two pairs of active magnetic ﬁeld coils were
constructed along the x and z axis, as the quantisation axis lies in the corresponding
plane. Field variations are detected using a 3-axis magnetic ﬂux sensor located next to
the main vacuum chamber, and feedback with a bandwidth of 1 kHz is then applied to
the coil currents for compensation. With this active stabilisation engaged, the elevator
no longer aﬀects the ﬁeld at the ion position to within our resolution of 0.15 nT.

corresponding to the data from (a) showing the Zeeman-shift stability and the
corresponding magnetic ﬁeld stability.

Figure 9 shows a time trace of the frequency feedback necessary to lock to the
qubit transitions for the cases of active and passive magnetic ﬁeld stabilisation. It is
apparent from the reduced RMS amplitude of the feedback loop that the active method
greatly improves the short-term stability of the ﬁeld. The Allan deviation shows a
passive magnetic ﬁeld stability of better than 1 nT at time scales from 1 second up
to 100 seconds. A fractional magnetic ﬁeld stability corresponding to 1 nT is below
6 · 10−6 and thus at the limits of commercially available current supplies. Our active
stabilisation suppresses ﬂuctuations up to several 10 seconds with an optimum stability
of about 200 pT at 1 second. This is close to the limit given by the resolution of the
employed magnetic ﬁeld sensor. Further improvements could result when shielding the
vacuum chamber with high-permeability materials to suppress low frequency drifts [75].

3.4. Coherence time

Decoherence on the qubit transition is caused by energy level shifts due to (a) ﬂuctuating
magnetic ﬁelds, and (b) ﬂuctuations in power and frequency of the source driving
the transition. For microwave excitation, frequency ﬂuctuations of the source can be
excluded, as all our radio-frequency devices are referenced to a maser with a stability
better than 10−12/
τ . Frequency excursions will thus be smaller than the Fourier-
limited transition linewidth for all reasonable interrogation times.

√

In most ion trap experiments, coherence times are limited by technical magnetic
ﬁeld noise at 50 Hz and its harmonics, originating from various electronic devices, as well
as switch-mode power supplies radiating at tens of kHz. Commonly reported coherence
times are in the 100 µs range for unshielded room temperature experiments [76, 46].

We measure the coherence time by performing a microwave Ramsey experiment on
our qubit transition. With the microwave drive tuned to resonance, the relative phase
of the second Ramsey pulse is scanned with respect to the ﬁrst. The amplitude of the
resulting sinusoidal signal indicates the maximum fringe contrast. Measurements for
diﬀerent Ramsey times allow to extract the coherence time, as shown in ﬁgure 10. It

Figure 10. Measured qubit coherence given by the contrast of Ramsey experiments
at varying Ramsey delays. The coherence shows a Gaussian envelope (red line) with
a 1/
e time constant of τ = 36(1) ms. The steep loss of contrast for Ramsey times
above τ is characteristic of our dominant noise process, slow magnetic ﬁeld drifts. The
grey dashed line is a e−t/τ ﬁt to the data.

should be noted that we neither use AC-line triggering nor apply spin-echo sequences
[77, 74, 78] to artiﬁcially extend the coherence time, as we want to determine the intrinsic
decoherence time scale. The coherence decay exhibits a Gaussian shape, scaling with
e−(t/2τ )2 if the intrinsic decoherence time is longer than the experimental Ramsey time
[79, 80]. A ﬁt to the data yields a 1/
If the
intrinsic decoherence is shorter than a single experimental cycle, the contrast falls oﬀ
exponentially with e−t/τ . The graph also shows a ﬁt to the data using the exponential
decay, which yields τ = 56(5) ms. However, especially at Ramsey times below 30 ms it
is apparent that the data is reproduced more appropriately by the Gaussian envelope,
validating the former ﬁt function.

e coherence time of τ = 36(1) ms.

√

The measured coherence time is about a factor of three higher than reported for an
optical transition in a similar cryogenic system [73] and comparable to that of a double
layer µ-metal shielded room temperature system, when operating with magnetic ﬁeld
coils inside the shield [80].

With the measured coherence time τ , the RMS magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations can be

expressed as [80]

(cid:113)

(cid:104)∆B2(cid:105) = 2¯h/(3µBτ ) = 330 pT ,

(1)

taking the magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of the transition of (3/2)µB/h into account, where
µB is Bohr’s magneton. This value is consistent with the measured Allan deviation
of the qubit transition frequency at averaging times of 0.5-5 s, corresponding to the
measurement time of a single phase scan.

3.5. Trap-induced ac Zeeman shift

The oscillating currents on the RF trap electrodes lead to a time-averaged second-order
Zeeman shift induced by the radial trapping potential. Due to imbalanced currents in
opposing electrodes, this can even be the case for operation at the AC electric ﬁeld null
of the trap [67, 81]. To investigate this eﬀect we performed Ramsey spectroscopy on the
|F = 2, mF = 0(cid:105) to |F = 1, mF = 0(cid:105) transition, see ﬁgure 8. This transition is insensitive
to ﬁrst order to magnetic ﬁeld changes, which enables us to use Ramsey times of 100 ms
to resolve the line with a width of 5 Hz. A two-point sampling frequency feedback
servo is employed to track the transition frequency. By running interleaved servos on
both the magnetic ﬁeld sensitive transition |↓(cid:105) to |↑(cid:105) and the insensitive transition
|F = 2, mF = 0(cid:105) to |F = 1, mF = 0(cid:105) we can correct for the second order frequency shift
due to drifts in the DC bias ﬁeld. The ﬁrst order-sensitive transition is interrogated
with a Ramsey time of 10 ms due to its larger frequency ﬂuctuations.

We measure the bias-ﬁeld-corrected transition frequency |F = 2, mF = 0(cid:105) to
|F = 1, mF = 0(cid:105) for three diﬀerent radial trap depths, corresponding to Be+ secular
frequencies of 1.05, 2.42 and 3.68 MHz. Any AC Zeeman shift increases the transition
frequency for higher radial secular frequencies. We see no signiﬁcant shift at the
level of our statistics-limited resolution of ∼1 Hz. With an AC Zeeman sensitivity of
314 mHz/µT2, this provides an upper bound of (cid:104)B2(cid:105) < 3 µT2 for trap-induced magnetic
ﬁelds. Owing to the strong scaling of the frequency of magnetic dipole transitions with
charge state [9], the equivalent AC Zeeman sensitivity in HCI is expected to be 3-4
orders of magnitude smaller than in singly charged systems [10].

ions. Due to its high charge, the Ar13+ displaces several Be+, appearing as a large
dark spot in the crystal.

4. Trapping of HCI

Highly charged argon ions are extracted in bunches from an EBIT with a mean energy
of 700 eV per unit charge, and decelerated to approximately 150 eV per unit charge
using a pulse-electrode potential elevator described in reference [82]. Operation of the
EBIT and deceleration beamline is described in detail elsewhere [31, 83].

A single charge state (Ar13+) is selected by its time of ﬂight for gated injection into
the Paul trap. The ﬁnal deceleration step is performed by raising the trap DC and RF
ground to a few volts below the remaining kinetic energy per unit charge. Once the ions
have passed the mirror electrode 1 (see ﬁgure 3), the electrode is switched to a higher
potential, conﬁning the HCI axially, together with the second pair of outer endcaps.
The inner endcaps provide a weak axial conﬁnement for a Be+ Coulomb crystal with
200 mV of applied voltage. Repeated passes and interactions with the Be+ dissipate the
kinetic energy of the HCI [84, 85, 86, 83] until a HCI becomes embedded in the Coulomb
crystal, leaving as signature a large dark spot in the otherwise ﬂuorescing crystal. For
quantum logic operations, a two-ion crystal of a Be+ ion and the spectroscopy ion is
needed. Thus, after co-crystallisation of the HCI, the excess Be+ ions are ejected from
the trap by parametric heating using the RF drive.

5. Conclusion

We have presented a cryogenic ion trap system speciﬁcally designed for spectroscopy
of single HCI, and characterised the ion trap with respect to heating rates, excess
micromotion and magnetic ﬁeld stability. Ground state cooling of all the normal modes
of a single 9Be+ ion has been demonstrated outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. With
the demonstrated speciﬁcations matching the design values, the system is well suited
for performing quantum logic spectroscopy not only with HCI, as planned, but also in

A cryogenic radio-frequency ion trap for quantum logic spectroscopy of highly charged ions20

other species such as molecular ions that would undoubtedly beneﬁt from the extremely
low level of BBR, the long coherence times resulting from the active cancellation of
external magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations and the double Faraday shielding by the high-
conductivity thermal shields, and the very low density of residual gas particles resulting
from the operation near 4 K. Further additions such as passive magnetic shielding will
help improving its advantages.
