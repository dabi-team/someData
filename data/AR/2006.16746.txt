ABSTRACT
We present results of our study of two planetary nebulae (PNe), PB1 and PC 19. We
use the optical spectra of these two PNe observed at 2 m Himalayan Chandra Tele-
scope and also archival and literature data for the study. We use the morphokinematic
code SHAPE to construct 3D morphologies of the PNe and the photoionization code
CLOUDY to model the observed spectra. The 3D model of PB 1 consists of an elon-
gated shell surrounded by a bipolar halo and that of PC 19 consists of an open lobed
bipolar structure and a spiral ﬁlamentary pair. We analyze the ionization structure of
the PNe by deriving several plasma parameters and by photoionization modelling. We
estimate the elemental abundances of the the elements, He, C, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and
Cl, from our analysis. We ﬁnd He, C and N abundances to be signiﬁcantly higher in
case of PB 1. We estimate diﬀerent physical parameters of the central stars, namely
eﬀective temperature, luminosity and gravity, and of the nebula, namely hydrogen
density proﬁles, radii, etc., from photoionization modelling. We estimate distances to
the PNe as ∼4.3 kpc for PB 1 and as ∼5.6 kpc for PC 19 by ﬁtting the photoionization
models to absolute observed ﬂuxes. Progenitor masses are estimated from theoretical
evolutionary trajectories and are found to be ∼1.67 and ∼2.38 M(cid:12) for PB 1 and PC
19, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION

Planetary nebulae (PNe) form towards the end of the life
cycle of low- and intermediate-mass (∼1-8 M(cid:12)) stars. The
basic formation mechanism of PNe could be explained by
the Interacting Stellar Wind (ISW) model (Kwok et al.
1978). According to this model, a circumstellar envelope,
moving slowly (v ∼ 10 km s−1) outward, is formed during
the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Then it is swept
by another fast (v ∼ 1000 km s−1) wind driven by the cen-
tral star during the post-AGB phase. This hydrodynamical
interaction forms a compressed spherical shell around the
star. The central star gradually attains high temperatures
(∼20000-200000 K) during its evolution towards white dwarf
(WD) and photoionizes the shell. High-resolution observa-
tions reveal that majority of PNe exhibit non-spherical cir-
cumstellar shells of very complex morphologies, e.g., ellipti-
cal, bipolar, multipolar etc., with the presence of small-scale
structures like knots, ﬁlaments and ansae (e.g., Sahai et al.
2011; Stanghellini et al. 2016). The observed PN morphol-

ogy is a result of combination of diﬀerent physical processes
having occurred at diﬀerent points of time, few during the
evolution of the central star and others within the nebu-
lar gas that evolves in dynamical time-scale. To understand
the morphologies, one need to reconstruct three-dimensional
(3D) models using the available observational constraints,
which include the spatially resolved images and spectra cor-
relating the position and velocity (e.g., Steﬀen & L´opez 2006;
Hsia et al. 2014; Clyne et al. 2015).

Spectra of PNe are enriched with strong recombination
lines (RLs) of H and He in emission over all wavelength
regimes. Strong collisionally excited lines (CELs) of C, N, O,
Ne, Ar, S, and Cl are frequently observed along with their
much RLs also. Infrared spectra of PNe show the presence
of molecules, such as, crystalline silicate, graphite, fullerene,
PAH molecules, water masers, HCN etc. (e.g., Zhang 2017
and references therein). Spectral lines have been used to
calculate abundances of the elements present in PNe using
the direct method based on the determination of the elec-
tron temperature and the use of ionization correction factors
(ICFs) and from photoionization modelling (e.g., Morisset
2017 and references therein). In low- and intermediate-mass

stars, the abundances of the elements O, Ne, S, Ar, and Cl
mostly remain unchanged throughout the evolutionary pro-
cess. Hence, the abundances of these elements represent that
of the birth environment of the progenitor. However, He, C,
and N are enriched during the evolutionary process. Thus,
their abundances in PNe provide clue on tracing back the
nucleosynthesis history of the progenitor (e.g., Henry et al.
2018 and references therein). The composition of PNe also
predicts enrichment of the interstellar medium, as the neb-
ulae gradually diﬀuse into it.

Earlier several attempts have been taken to estimate the
total number of observable galactic PNe and diﬀerent cat-
alogues have been prepared, for example ‘Strasbourg-ESO
Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae’ (Acker et al. 1992)
that included a list of about 1200 PNe, and ‘Version 2000
of the Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae’ (Kohoutek
2001) that listed ∼1500 PNe. In the last decade, more sensi-
tive surveys such as MASH (Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg
Hα Planetary Galactic Catalogue; Parker et al. 2006),
MASH-II (Miszalski et al. 2008), and IPHAS (Isaac Newton
Telescope Photometric Hα Survey of the Northern Galactic
Plane; Drew et al. 2005) were conducted, along with several
follow-up diagnostics. From these surveys many new PNe
have been detected and consequently the total number of
galactic PNe (including suspected ones) has been increased
to ∼3500. However, out of these, a few have been individu-
ally studied in detail so far (e.g. NGC 7027, NGC 6720, NGC
6853, etc.). The information acquired from the well-studied
PNe in combination with the data and information collected
from the observation and study of the less known PNe could
play an important role in understanding the properties that
may still be hidden among the PNe.

In this paper, we present the study of the characteris-
tics of two such PNe, PB 1 and PC 19, which have not been
studied individually in detail. We use optical spectra us-
ing 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and relevant
archival data. We have modelled the spectra using SHAPE
and CLOUDY for morphological and photoionization analy-
ses, respectively. We have discussed about the details of data
set used in this work in Section 2. The modelling procedure
and results are discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.
We summarize and discuss the results in Section 5.

2 DATA SET

2.1 2 m HCT Observations and Data Reduction

PB 1 and PC 19 were observed using the 2 m HCT located at
Hanle, India, operated by Indian Institute of Astrophysics,
India. Optical spectra were obtained using the Hanle Faint
Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) through the grisms,
Gr. 7 (∼3700-7000 ˚A, R ∼ 1400) and Gr. 8 (∼5500-9000 ˚A,
R ∼ 2200), hereafter referred as blue spectra and red spec-
tra, respectively (Table 1). A slit of dimension 1(cid:48)(cid:48).92 × 11(cid:48)
was placed approximately through the centre of the objects
during observations. FeAr and FeNe lamp spectra for the
wavelength calibrations to blue and red spectra, respectively,
were taken immediately after each object exposure. Feige 66
(V = 10.5, Spectral type: sdO) and Feige 110 (V = 11.8,
Spectral type: DOp) were observed as optical standards,
during the observations of PB 1 and PC 19, respectively,
for the ﬂux calibration.

Spectra are reduced following the standard procedure
using diﬀerent tasks under the IRAF package. All spec-
tra are, ﬁrst, bias subtracted and cosmic-ray corrected, and
then the 1D spectra summed across the aperture are ex-
tracted using APALL. Wavelength calibration in each spec-
trum is made using the corresponding reference lamp spec-
trum. Flux calibration is done using the sensitivity function
determined from ﬂux data of the standard star after making
airmass correction. The spectra are corrected for interstellar
extinction using

I(λ) = F (λ)10[c(Hβ)f (λ)]

(1)

where, I(λ) and F (λ) are the intrinsic and observed
ﬂuxes, respectively, c(Hβ) is the logarithmic extinction at
Hβ and f (λ) is the extinction curve derived by Cardelli,
Clayton & Mathis Cardelli et al. (1989). The value of c(Hβ)
is obtained in order to match the theoretical Balmer line
ratios in the dereddened spectrum. For the calculation us-
ing Equation 1, we adopt the theoretical intrinsic value of
I(Hα)/I(Hβ) = 2.847, corresponding to the electron tem-
perature, Te = 104 K and electron density, Ne = 104 cm−3
(Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).

2.2 Archival Data

2.2.1 Narrow-band Images

We have used pipeline-calibrated high-resolution Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) images of the PNe from the Hubble
Legacy Archive (HLA) 1. The images were obtained using
the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) instrument
in narrow bands at a spatial resolution of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).045 pixel−1.
The image of PB 1 was taken through Hα ﬁlter (F656N;
λc = 6564, ∆λ = 22) with an exposure of 1120 seconds on
Sep. 27, 1999 (PI: Sahai; Proposal ID: 8345). The image of
PC 19 was obtained with 600 seconds of exposure through
[N ii] (F658N; λc = 6591, ∆λ = 29) ﬁlter on Jun. 29, 1999
(PI: Borkowski; Proposal ID: 6347).

The narrow-band images of PC 19 have been taken from
IAC Morphological Catalog of Northern Galactic Planetary
Nebulae (Manchado et al. 1996). The observations were ob-
tained using the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)
through Hα (λc = 6563, ∆λ = 10), [N ii] (λc = 6584, ∆λ =
10), and [O iii] (λc = 5007, ∆λ = 30) ﬁlters at a spatial
resolution of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).139 pixel−1.

2.2.2 Long-slit Echelle Spectra

Bi-dimensional, spatially resolved long-slit Echelle spectra in
form of position-velocity (PV) diagrams are taken from San
Pedro M´artir Kinematic Catalogue of Galactic Planetary
Nebulae (L´opez et al. 2012). The observations for building
this catalogue were carried out at San Pedro M´artir Na-
tional Observatory, Mexico, using the Manchester Echelle
Spectrometer (MES). The spectra for both PB 1 and PC 19
were obtained using 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit with resolution of 11.5 km s−1.

We have also used the long-slit Echelle spectra for PC 19

using the IACUB spectrometer at the NOT, through 0(cid:48)(cid:48).64
slit at a resolution of (cid:39) 9 − 10 km s−1.

3 MODELING PROCEDURE

3.1 3D Modeling

3D reconstruction of the nebular structure are performed
using the morphokinematic modelling code SHAPE (Steﬀen
et al. 2011). In SHAPE, 3D mesh model can be constructed
with one or more geometrical components using the basic ge-
ometrical structures, e.g., sphere, torus, cone etc. The com-
ponents can be attributed with certain density proﬁle and
velocity ﬁeld using density and velocity modiﬁers, respec-
tively. The code computes radiation transfer through the
nebula and generates various model outputs, such as, syn-
thetic image (2D projection of the reconstructed model), PV

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

spectra (PV diagrams), etc., that are compared with the ob-
servations. The basic geometry can be modiﬁed in a required
way using various structural modiﬁers, e.g., squeeze, spiral,
twist, etc. The squeeze modiﬁer is used to obtain bipolar-
ity and waist in a basic mesh structure by compressing it
towards radially inward direction along a line. The spiral
modiﬁer is used to obtain spiral appearance in any struc-
ture, and degree of spirality can be changed by adjusting
geometric parameters. By applying twist modiﬁer, a struc-
ture can be twisted around any speciﬁed axis. In this work,
3D models have been constructed using mainly the high-
resolution HST narrow-band images. Additionally, we apply
some constrain on the model using available velocity ﬁeld
information of the objects in form of PV diagrams.

The comparison of the observed and model image and
the PV diagrams are done using eye-estimation. At ﬁrst the
parameters are varied in a larger range. Afterwards the pa-
rameters are narrowed down to certain range, beyond which
signiﬁcant deviation from the observation has been noticed.

PV diagram in Hα. The red and blue halves of the model PV correspond to the red and blueshifted regions, respectively.

3.2 Photoionization Modeling

For a compact and self-consistent description of the ioniza-
tion structure of the nebulae, we compute individual pho-
toionization models of PB 1 and PC 19 using the photoion-
ization code CLOUDY (version 17.00, Ferland et al. 2017
and references therein). CLOUDY uses a set of input param-
eters that deﬁne the ionizing source and the nebula. Gener-
ally, a spherical shell geometry is considered for the nebula
with an ionizing source at the centre. The code solves ion-
ization balance and energy balance equations at each point
of the nebula, and calculate radiation transfer, generating
the model spectrum at the end.

In each model computed here, the incident radiation
from the central star is characterized by eﬀective temper-
ature and luminosity. We also consider the stellar model
atmosphere, ‘Rauch PN Nuclei’ (Rauch 2003) (solar abun-
dance grid, Log Z = 0.0), in order to include the physical
eﬀects of stellar atmosphere and include gravity of the cen-
tral star as a model parameter. The shell, representing the
nebula is parametrized by elemental abundances, hydrogen
density, ﬁlling factor, covering factor, and inner and outer
radii. The initial elemental abundances are set to the values
calculated by PyNeb (Luridiana et al. 2015) package (see
Sections 4.1.2 & 4.2.2). However, all the abundances have
been afterwards kept as free parameters for necessary ad-
justments of line strengths of diﬀerent elements. By deﬁning
outer radii for the nebula in the model, the ionization struc-
ture is considered as matter-bound. Filling factor is included
to account for clumping eﬀects inside the nebula.

Since the entire nebula might not have been covered
by the slit during observation, there might be some ﬂux
loss, and use of observed Hβ ﬂux as the reference value for
modelling would underestimate the actual absolute ﬂuxes.
Hence, to match the ﬂux from entire nebula, we multiply the
observed spectrum by the ratio of the total Hα ﬂux (Frew
et al. 2013) to the observed Hα ﬂux. Not to mention that the
scaling is only for the purpose of obtaining the appropriate
Hβ ﬂux to match with the spherical Cloudy model and rel-
ative ﬂuxes of the emission lines to Hβ would still represent
that observed through the slit, and not from the entire neb-

ula. We ﬁt the model spectra with the this corrected spectra
in absolute ﬂux units. Fitting our photoionization model to
absolute ﬂuxes allows us to obtain an estimation of distance
self-consistently from the model.

To achieve the best-ﬁtting model, the parameters are
varied until the observables are satisfactorily reproduced by
the model. To properly reproduce the ionization structure of
a nebula through modelling, it is important to match line ra-
tios governing the plasma properties (electron temperatures
and densities) as close as possible to their observed values.
Before adjusting the abundances to match the line ﬂuxes of
a particular element, we reproduce the ratios between dif-
ferent ionization states as close as possible to the observed
values. The line ﬂuxes corresponding to each element de-
pend not only on the abundance of that element itself, but,
sometimes, it is strongly inﬂuenced by abundances of other
elements also. Hence, the abundance of any particular ele-
ment is adjusted, when necessary, to match the line ﬂuxes
of that or other elements. An appropriate model spectrum
would simultaneously match the observed continuum, the
absolute Hβ ﬂux for the entire nebula, and the line ﬂuxes
relative to Hβ. It may be mentioned here that we do not
subtract the stellar part from the observed continuum and
hence, ﬁt the total emitted continuum from the PNe.

To test the goodness of the model, we calculate the root
mean square (r.m.s.) value of the ﬁt using the following equa-
tion,

r.m.s. =

Here, Mi and Oi are the modelled and observed value,
respectively, of the ith observable and n denotes the total
number of observables. If the r.m.s. is less than unity, then
the model is considered acceptable.

We test the quality of ﬁtting of the individual observ-
ables by calculating the quality factor, κi, of the ﬁtting of the

& Georgiev (2009). The quality factor is deﬁned as,

structural components that are commonly seen among the
PNe.

Here, σi is the error in the ith observable. To obtain
κi corresponding to each emission line, σi in the observed
emission line ﬂux is deﬁned as 0.1 for I(λ) > 0.1 Hβ; 0.2 for
0.1 Hβ > I(λ) > 0.01 Hβ & 0.3 for I(λ) < 0.01 Hβ. The
ﬁtting is considered within the tolerance limit if the absolute
value of κi is less than 1.

4 RESULTS

4.1 PB 1

PB 1 (PN G226.4-03.7), discovered by Peimbert & Batiz
(1960), is a galactic anticentre PN (R.A. = 07h02m46.8s,
Dec. = −13◦42(cid:48)33(cid:48)(cid:48).7). Among the previous studies of PB 1,
Gleizes et al. (1989) estimated a Zanstra hydrogen temper-
ature (TZ(H i)) of 37500 K and Zanstra helium temperature
(TZ(He ii)) of 76500 K, for the central star and placed PB 1
in high-excitation class. PB 1 was classiﬁed as elliptical and
point symmetric by Sahai et al. (2011) (hereafter, SMV11).
Logarithmic Hβ ﬂux (in units of erg cm−2 s−1) was esti-
mated to be −12.3 ± 0.4 by Acker et al. (1991) and −12.03
by Cahn et al. (1992). Frew et al. (2013) found a logarithmic
Hα ﬂux of −11.68 ± 0.07. In the following, we discuss the
results obtained from our study of PB 1.

4.1.1 Nebular Morphology: 3D Modeling

The Hα image of PB 1 depicts an inner shell surrounded by
a halo (Figure 1(a)). The overall structure is elongated ap-
proximately along the North-West (N-W) & South-East (S-
E) direction. The inner shell has a dimension of 5(cid:48)(cid:48).1 × 5(cid:48)(cid:48).2.
It appears to be ﬁlamentary and clumpy in a random pat-
tern, referred as ‘weaves’ or ‘mottling’ by SMV11. It depicts
an “S” shaped structure, curving Westward and Eastward
near the N-W and S-E regions, respectively, giving rise to
the point symmetry. The origin of point symmetry seems to
be due to dynamical evolution of the inner shell in a spiral
motion. This is supported by the fact that density enhance-
ments can be noticed in the upper and lower portion of the
shell. The halo is limb-brightened and shows discontinuity
(SMV11). It has a dimension of 10(cid:48)(cid:48).1 × 10(cid:48)(cid:48).2. A feeble den-
sity enhancement is noticed around the minor axis of the
halo, seemingly at the equatorial region. Along the direc-
tion of elongation of the halo, a region with lower density
appears as trough. This feature is more prominent in N-W
direction than in the S-E. It is interesting to see that the
curved lobes of the inner shell is approximately directed to-
wards the trough. This suggests that the shell might have
changed direction towards the lower density region in the
halo. However, only 3D morphological reconstruction can
truly reveal the nebular structural details properly. For the
reconstruction, we primarily refer to the HST Hα image,
along with the Hα, [O iii] and [N ii] PV diagrams (Figure
2(a)) taken from L´opez et al. (2012). We have aimed to con-
struct the model using possible types and combination of

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

To model the inner shell, initially we have tried with
diﬀerent combinations and orientations of multiple shells to
reproduce the observed image, because the shells seen in PNe
images are often modelled with combination of multiple in-
tersecting shells (e.g., Hsia et al. 2014). However, none of
them could reproduce the observed structure satisfactorily.
Finally, a single shell structure is adopted to reproduce the
inner shell. The size modiﬁer is used to transform the basic
spherical shell into elliptical. Afterwards, squeeze, twist and
spiral modiﬁers are applied to achieve the point symmetric
appearance of the inner shell. We use customised density
proﬁle using two density modiﬁers to replicate uneven dis-
tribution of matter along the surface, as evident from the
2D image. To replicate the clumpy and ﬁlamentary nature
of the inner shell in the model image, we assumed a par-
ticle distribution using the particles option inside the shell
structure.

Estimation of the inclination and expansion velocity of
the inner shell is guided by the PV diagrams (Figure 2(a)).
The inner structure is not evidently resolved in Hα proﬁle,
whereas, in the [O iii] proﬁle, an inclined ring is evident. The
[N ii] proﬁle clearly shows two blobs, suggesting the inclina-
tion more clearly. Although, the available PV diagrams are
not adequate to properly resolve the degeneracy in simulta-
neous estimation of the dimension, inclination and expan-
sion velocity of the system, we obtain an optimized result
for these parameters according to eye-estimation. From the
best-ﬁtting model, we obtain the diﬀerent structural param-
eters of the basic elliptical shell: the major-to-minor axis of
the inner shell is found to be 1.67; the inclination and posi-
tion angle of the inner shell are estimated as 65◦ and 313◦,
respectively; the ratio of outer-to-inner radius is 1.05. How-
ever, the values of these parameters only represent those of
the basic elliptical shell formed using the size modiﬁer. The
position of the blobs in the observed [N ii] PV diagram sug-
gest an expansion velocity of ∼ 20 km s−1 along the line of
sight. By adjusting the maximum expansion velocity of the
inner shell to 40 km s−1, we obtain a good match of the ob-
served and model PV diagram as well as the velocity along
the line of sight is reproduced. The comparison between the
observed and modelled PV diagram is shown in Figure 2(b).
The halo is modelled with a bipolar structure with a
lower degree of bipolarity. Along with the mesh, we use a
volume distribution of particles for the halo. The density
distribution function is chosen to be constant throughout
the structure. The density enhancement in the halo seems
to be due to the superposition of the lobes of the bipolar
structure. Hence, the orientation of the halo is adjusted in
such a way that the density enhanced region of the observed
and the modelled image superpose on one another. From
the best-ﬁtting model we ﬁnd that the halo is inclined at an
angle of 15◦ with the line of sight and makes a position angle
of 317◦, similar to the inner shell. The major-to-minor axis
of the halo is found out to be 2.125. In the model, we adopt
Hubble like (v ∝ r) homologous expansion law for deﬁning
the velocity ﬁeld of the halo. However, the PV diagrams
cannot properly resolve the separation between the halo and
the inner shell and also the bipolarity in the halo is also not
evident. Due to these reasons, we do not approach to set a
velocity ﬁeld for the halo and hence, we do not estimate the

6

expansion velocity of the halo in this work. We estimate the
distance to PB 1 from photoionization modelling (Sec. 4.1.3)
and thereby calculate the dimensions of the components in
absolute units. These results are discussed later in Sec. 4.1.4.
In Figure 1, the observed Hα image and the rendered
synthetic image (both in grey-scale) are shown side-by-side,
depicting the 2D morphology being well-reproduced by our
model. The side view and sky view of the mesh model of the
nebular structure are also shown. The parameters estimated
from the model are summarized in Table 2.

4.1.2 Analysis of Optical Spectrum

Emission Lines and Fluxes

The blue and red spectrum of PB 1 are separately shown in
Figure 3. For the purpose of our analysis, we combine the
two regions into one spectrum by proper scaling. Strong RLs
and CELs are present in the spectrum, suggesting PB 1 as
moderately- to high-excitation PN. The commonly observed
RLs of hydrogen (such as, Hα 6563, Hβ 4861, Hγ 4340, Hδ
4101, and H(cid:15) 3970 ˚A) and helium (such as, He i 4471, 5876,
6678, and 7065 ˚A) are present in the spectrum. Presence of
He ii 4686 ˚A implies high central star temperature (Teﬀ >
50, 000). The RL doublet C iv 5802, 5812 ˚A is prominently
observed. Among the CELs, [O iii] 5007, 4959 ˚A and the
auroral [O iii] 4363 ˚A, [Ne iii] 3869 ˚A, [Ar iv] 4711, 4740 ˚A
and [Ar iii] 7136, 7751 ˚A, [S iii] 6312, 9069 ˚A, [Cl iv] 7531,
8046 ˚A are prominently seen. The [N ii] 6548 ˚A and [N ii]
6583 ˚A are partially blended with Hα line in our spectrum.
However, we cannot detect the auroral [N ii] 5755 ˚A with
conﬁdence. The doublets [S ii] 6716, 6731 ˚A and [Cl iii]
5518, 5538 ˚A are also below conﬁdence limit of detection.
We ﬁnd the logarithmic extinction at Hβ, c(Hβ) = 0.64,
aiming to obtain the theoretical Balmer line ratio, Hα/Hβ,
in the dereddened spectrum. The Hβ ﬂux through slit is
measured as, F (Hβ) = 1.60 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1.

Plasma Diagnostics

We analyse the physical conditions inside the nebula from
the known emission line ﬂuxes using the PyNeb package.
We calculate [O iii], [S iii] electron temperatures (Te) and
[Ar iv] electron density (Ne) using the CEL ratios com-
monly adopted in the literature (Table 3). As the [Ar iv]
4711 ˚A is blended with He i 4713 ˚A, before using [Ar iv]
4711 ˚A for analysis, we have subtracted the He i contribu-
tion from the blended feature using the theoretical value He i
4713/4471= 0.146 (considering Te = 104 K and Ne = 104
cm−3) (Benjamin et al. 1999). We list electron temperatures
and densities estimated by Henry et al. (2010) for compari-
son with our estimated values. We also use PyNeb to obtain
Te-Ne map (Figure 4) for [S iii], [O iii] and [Ar iv] ions to
show the variation of one with the other for diﬀerent ions in-
side the nebula. We apply the direct method to calculate the
elemental abundances from the observed emission line ﬂuxes
using PyNeb. From the Te-Ne map, we approximately ob-
tain Te ∼ 11, 500 K and ne ∼ 2500 cm−3, which we use
during calculation of ionic abundances of the ions present
in the spectrum. We further calculate the total elemental
abundances for CELs of N, O, Ne and Ar, adopting the ICF
expressions from Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014). In Table 4,

we present the calculated ionic and total abundances along
with the ICF values. We could not calculate S/H and Cl/H
using the same method, as no [S ii] and [Cl iii] lines are
observed in our spectrum. Also, we could not calculate C/H
using the RL C ii 4267 ˚A, as that line is not detected.

4.1.3 Ionization Characteristics: Photoionization

Modeling

Photoionization modelling of PB 1 is performed following
the basic modelling procedure described in Section 3.2. A
spherical shell geometry is considered around the central
source. We assume the nebula to be matter bound by deﬁn-
ing outer radius for the shell. As TZ(H i) (37500 K) is con-
siderably lower than TZ(He ii) (76500 K), it seems that the
nebula is not optically thick in hydrogen Lyman continuum.
This supports the assumption of matter-bound case in our
model.

Figure 5 shows the ﬁt of the observed spectrum with
the model spectrum. The comparison between the observed
and modelled ﬂuxes of the emission lines are given in Table
5. The quality of ﬁt of each emission line can be veriﬁed
from the calculated ratio of the modelled and the observed
ﬂux value. Though we compare all the observed line ﬂuxes
with the model line ﬂuxes, we focus on ﬁtting particular
lines characterizing the overall ionization structure through-
out the modelling and calculate the r.m.s value of the ﬁtting
using these lines. These lines include He i 5876 ˚A, He ii 4686
˚A, [O ii] 3727, 7325 ˚A, [O iii] 5007, 4363 ˚A, [N ii] 6583 ˚A,
[Ne iii] 3869 ˚A, [S iii] 9069 ˚A, [Ar iv] 4711, 4740 ˚A, [Ar iii]
7136 ˚A, and [Cl iv] 8045 ˚A. The r.m.s value of the model ﬁt
is calculated to be 0.13, well below unity. The value of the
quality factor (κi) corresponding to each line, as discussed
in Sec. 3.2, is included in Table 5.

We have taken care of the line ratios used for plasma
diagnostics (as discussed in Sec. 4.1.2), which include [O iii]
5007/4363, [S iii] 9069/6312 and [Ar iv] 4740/4711, while
matching the observed spectra. In the best ﬁt model, the
ﬁrst two ratios match well with the observation, though,
the latter is slightly lower than the observed value. Also, we
have tried to reproduce the ratios among diﬀerent ioniza-
tion states of same element as closely as possible in order to
properly constrain the abundances. However, in our model,
the ionization balance of [O ii]/[O iii] is close to the ob-
served value and the ratio [Ar iii]/[Ar iv] remains slightly
higher than the observed value. Any procedure to ﬁt the
ratio [Ar iii]/[Ar iv] with the observed value was aﬀecting
the balance of [O ii]/[O iii]. Since the abundance determi-
nation of other elements (except He) depend on the value of
[O ii]/[O iii], we emphasize on the ﬁtting of this ratio.

The results of modelling are summarized in Table 4.
From the best-ﬁtting model, we obtain central star’s eﬀec-
tive temperature to be 86500 K. The temperature is slightly
above the TZ(He ii) (76500 K). Our model He ii 4686 ˚A is
slightly underestimated than the observed. We have had to
keep the Log g of the central star at 5.0 in order to ﬁt the
line strength of observed He ii 4686 ˚A in our model. We
could not test our model for lower value of Log g as 5.0 is
the minimum value allowed for the model atmosphere. Any
other methods (such as, increasing Teﬀ ) to ﬁt this line have
been aﬀecting the other observables. However, He ii 4686 ˚A
might also have been enhanced in the observed spectrum as

the slit only partially covered the nebula towards the central
region.

We have introduced a ﬁlling factor in our model due
to the evidence of clumpy nature of the inner shell in the
HST image. We have also noticed that the ﬁtting of diﬀer-
ent ionization states are also improved due to the inclusion
of ﬁlling factor. However, the presence of ﬁlling factor as a
free model parameter may involve degeneracy in the simulta-
neous estimation of luminosity, distance and nebular radii.
The method applied to constrain these parameters during
modelling, along with their estimated values, is discussed in
Sec. 4.1.4.

We have adopted a variable density proﬁle (nH =
nH(r)) as model
input, using the density law option in
CLOUDY, to account for the structure of PB 1, which con-
sists of high-density inner shell followed by the low-density
halo. The radial density proﬁle shown in Figure 6 is used
as the input hydrogen density of the nebula in our model.
Similar assumption of density proﬁle were adopted in case

of other PNe also, e.g., Lin 39 (Otsuka et al. 2016) and NGC
6781 (Otsuka et al. 2017). Use of this density proﬁle in place
of a constant hydrogen density in the shell improve the over-
all ﬁtting of the higher to lower ionization line ratios of same
elements. In particular, we observe a sharp improvement in
the ﬁtting of observed [Ar iv]/[Ar iii] ratio. The density
proﬁle shows the hydrogen density of the inner shell to be
∼ 4.5×103 cm−3 and that of the halo to be ∼ 4.5×102 cm−3.
We consider the density proﬁle smoothly decreasing at the
interface of the inner shell and halo instead of a one-step

and ICF values calculated for obtaining the total elemen-
tal abundances from direct method, and the model ionic
fractions of the elements along with the corresponding ICF
values calculated from those fractions.

The abundances, He/H and O/H, obtained from pho-
toionization modelling and direct method (using ICF) in this
work match well with those estimated by H10. However, our
model N/H is about twice compared to the H10 value and
also to the value obtained using ICF in our analysis. Both of
our estimated values of Ne/H from model and using ICF are
slightly lower than that obtained by H10. Our Ar/H value
obtained from model is slightly lower than that obtained by
H10, while being slightly higher than that estimated using
ICF in this work. In case of S and Cl, no information about
the abundances could be obtained using direct method. Fur-
ther, lines from only one ionization state of these elements
are observed in the spectrum. S/H from the model is close
to that obtained by H10. We did not ﬁnd any reference to
compare our Cl/H value. As our photoionization model sat-
isfactorily reproduces the observed ionization structure, we
may trust and accept these abundance values.

We could not obtain C/H from the plasma analysis.
The only C lines present in our spectrum are the RLs C iv
5802, 5812 ˚A, which we could not generate using CLOUDY.
Hence, we kept C/H constant at solar value (2.69 × 10−4)
(Grevesse et al. 2010) at the initial stage of modelling, which
is much below the previous estimation by H10 (11.0 × 10−4).
Simultaneously, we found that the model line ratio [O iii]
5007/4363 was remaining much less than the observed value.
We could not properly reproduce the line ratio using other
cooling methods. These led us to increase the C abun-
dance in the photoionization model that acts for cooling of
the plasma, and reproduces the required line ratio [O iii]
5007/4363 in turn. Following this method, C/H is obtained
as 12.11 × 10−4, which is close to that estimated by H10. We

function of the radius. The assumption of smoothly varying
proﬁle seem to be more realistic than the presence of dis-
continuity in the density proﬁle inside the shell. Further, it
helps to avoid interruption in computation due to the abrupt
change in the function.

We ﬁnd that with our estimated physical parameters,
we obtain a good match between the observed and modelled
continuum, and also, for example, the observed absolute Hβ
ﬂux, Log I(Hβ) = −11.68, matches well with the model
value of Log I(Hβ) = −11.69.

In Table 4, we present the elemental abundances esti-
mated from photoionization modelling and those obtained
using direct method (Sec. 4.1.2) along with the abundances
obtained by Henry et al. (2010) (hereafter H10) for com-
parison. In Table 4, we also present the ionic abundances

4.1.4 Distance, Nebular Radii and Luminosity

Previously, distance to PB 1 had been calculated as 4.3
kpc by Tajitsu & Tamura (1998) and 5.243 ± 1.049 kpc by
Stanghellini & Haywood (2010). Most recently, from Gaia
DR2 parallaxes, Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) statistically de-

termined the distance to be 3.925 kpc with a lower and an
upper bound of 2.673 and 6.242 kpc, respectively.

The process of obtaining distance (d) using photoion-
ization modelling, by ﬁtting the observed spectrum in ab-
solute ﬂuxes, may involve degeneracy if the nebular radius
(r), luminosity (L), and nebular ﬁlling factor (f ) are also
free parameters in the same model. If the model distance
is appropriately estimated, the model should reproduce the
observed absolute ﬂux. Simultaneously, the angular extent of
the nebula measured using the estimated distance and radii
should match the angular extent of the nebula as observed
in the 2D image. The readers may ﬁnd a similar argument
in Otsuka et al. (2009).

In our modelling process, ﬁrst, we choose several dis-
tance values in a range of ∼2-7 kpc (referring the range of
literature values) and calculate nebular radii (rin and rout)
for each value of distance using the 2D image and our pro-
posed 3D morphology of the nebula. For each set of distance
and corresponding radii, we run several models by varying
rest of the parameters. By studying all the model generated
spectra, we obtain a range of distance for the models have
yielded better ﬁt of the observed spectrum. During this pro-
cess, we adopted a ﬁlling factor ∼0.05 and slightly varied
around that value to ﬁt the Hβ ﬂux and the ratios of higher
to lower ionization lines at the ﬁnal stages of modelling.

We ﬁnd that the overall observed spectrum (line ﬂuxes
and the continuum) ﬁts well for the distance approximately
in the range of ∼3.25-3.75 kpc. Thus we adopt an average
value of d = 3.5 kpc in our ﬁnal model. We estimate a lumi-
nosity of 3650 L(cid:12) and a ﬁlling factor of 0.07.

However, the estimated distance may involve uncertain-
ties as d, L and f may involve degeneracy. Theoretically,
the model estimated values are degenerate with another
model calculated with the values, d = x × 3.5 kpc (with
rin = x × 0.059 pc and rout = x × 0.138 pc, along with the
values L = x2 × 3650 L(cid:12) and f = 0.07/x (e.g. Morisset &
Georgiev 2009), where x is a real number. We constrain the
distance properly using the information from stellar evolu-
tionary models and following independent method described
in Morisset & Georgiev (2009). By studying the ‘H-burning
PNN evolutionary models’ (Z = 0.016) (Vassiliadis & Wood
1994), at Teﬀ = 86500 K, we obtain the relation between the
age (t) and the luminosity (L) of the progenitor as,

Log(t) = 13.5547 − 2.64644 × Log(L/L(cid:12))

(4)

If we assume the nebular expansion velocity, vexp = 40 km
s−1, obtained for the inner shell from the 3D model, we ob-
tain a nebular age of 3380 yr, considering rout = 0.138 pc as
the edge of the nebula. As the nebular age is linearly pro-
portional to distance and nebular radii, it is also degenerate
and t = x × 3380 yr. This, along with L/L(cid:12) = x2 × 3650
leads to the relation,

Log(t) = 1.75 + 0.5 × Log(L/L(cid:12))

(5)

From equations 4 and 5, we obtain a luminosity of 5646 L(cid:12),
and x = 1.2437, thereby obtain the distance of 4.35 kpc, and
a ﬁlling factor of 0.056 as the ﬁnal model values for these
parameters. For d = 4.35 kpc, an 1(cid:48)(cid:48).0 angular separation
would correspond to 0.0211 pc in the sky plane. Using this
value, with the information about relative dimensions of the
components obtained from the 3D model, we have measured
the dimensions of the inner shell and the halo in absolute

shells and the ﬁlaments arise at a ﬁnite radius from the cen-
tre (SMV11).

The 3D morphology of PC 19 is constructed mainly
based on high-resolution [N ii] image (Figure 8(a)). We
model the ﬁlament pair by constructing highly collimated
structure in SHAPE by applying size and squeeze modiﬁers
on a basic sphere. Then we obtain its point symmetric and
spiral appearance using spiral and twist modiﬁers together.
Constant volume-density distribution of particles is used to
replicate the clumpy eﬀect of the arms. However, we faced
diﬃculty to model the central region of PC 19 using the
[N ii] image only, as, no high-resolution images comparable
to HST images are available for PC 19 in higher-ionization
lines (Hα/[O iii]) to resolve the central structure eﬀectively.
Hence, we take the reference of the PV diagram in Hα and
[N ii] from L´opez et al. (2012) (Figure 9(a)). In the [N ii]
PV proﬁle, the two blobs are seen, which correspond to the
positions and velocities of the ﬁlament pair having veloci-
ties blueward and redward, with no prominent evidence of
the central portion. Whereas, in Hα PV proﬁle, the central
structure is prominent. Hence, combining the available clues
from the PV diagrams and IAC images, we assume a bipolar
central structure with partially open lobes. Along with the
mesh, the structure is modelled with distribution of parti-
cles in such a way that the density would, in eﬀect, appear
decreasing along the major axis and increasing radially out-
ward along the direction of the minor axis. A velocity ﬁeld
proportional to the distance from the central star is assumed.
As discussed earlier also, simultaneous estimation of the
expansion velocity, inclination angle and length of the com-
ponent involves a certain amount of degeneracy, thus, mak-
ing diﬃcult to obtain a unique set of parameters. After try-
ing diﬀerent combination of these parameters, we obtain an
optimized set for these parameters from the model that ﬁts
best according to eye-estimation.

We study the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬁlaments using [N ii]
spectra (PV diagrams) (Figure 9(b)) taken from Guerrero et
al. (1999). The spectra were obtained at position angles 0◦
and 28◦. The diﬀerent slit orientations cover two diﬀerent re-
gions in each ﬁlament, giving PV correlation at two regions
along the length of each ﬁlament. Using this information, we
aim to construct the radial velocity structure (Figure 10) of
the outﬂowing matter in the ﬁlaments. We use the custom
velocity proﬁle in the velocity modiﬁer deﬁning the veloc-
ity ﬁeld. We adjust the velocity values along the radius to
match the observed PV diagrams for both the slit orienta-
tions. Finally, we obtain best-ﬁtting result of the proﬁle by
eye-estimation. Also, we obtain an estimation of the maxi-
mum expansion velocity of the central region as 50 km s−1,
by matching the faint structures at the central part of the
PV diagrams. The structure is inclined at an angle of 30◦
with the line of sight creating a position angle of 355◦. The
major-to-minor axis ratio for the central structure is found
to be 2.75. The ﬁlaments are approximately aligned with the
major axis of the central structure. Simultaneous estimation
of the expansion velocity, inclination angle and length of the
component, involves the problem of degeneracy.

The parameters of the 3D model are summarized in Ta-
ble 6. In Figure 8 the observed [N ii] image and the rendered
synthetic image (both in grey-scale) are shown side-by-side,
depicting the 2D morphology being well-reproduced by our
model. The side view, top view, front view and sky view

units (here, in pc). We ﬁnd the major axis and minor axis
of the inner shell (considering inner radius) to be 0.091 and
0.054 pc, respectively, and those of the halo to be 0.226 and
0.106 pc, respectively. We take the average values of the
axes of the inner shell as 0.073 pc and of the halo as 0.17
pc and use these values as rin and rout, respectively, in our
photoionization model.

4.2 PC 19

PC 19 (PN G032.1+07.0), discovered by Peimbert & Cos-
tero (1961), is located towards the galactic centre (R.A. =
18h24m44.5s, Dec. = +02◦29(cid:48)27(cid:48)(cid:48).9. In the previous studies,
Stanghellini et al. (2002) estimated an upper limit to the
central star temperature, Teﬀ = 88920 K (Log Teﬀ = 4.949)
and a luminosity, L = 6577L(cid:12) (Log L/L(cid:12) = 3.818) from
Zanstra analysis. Logarithmic Hβ and Hα ﬂux was obtained
as −12.3 ± 0.1 (Acker et al. 1991) and −11.36 ± 0.04 (Frew
et al. 2013), respectively. PC 19 is known to have a pair of
low ionization ﬁlaments that gives a point symmetric ap-
pearance (Guerrero et al. 1999; Gon¸calves et al. 2001).Also,
in the IAC Morphological Catalog of Northern Galactic
Planetary Nebulae (Manchado et al. 1996), it has been clas-
siﬁed as ‘point symmetric’. Whereas, the PN has been clas-
siﬁed as ‘Spiral’ by SMV11. In the following, we describe
the results obtained from morphological and photoioniza-
tion modelling of PC 19

4.2.1 Nebular Morphology: 3D Modeling

The narrow band Hα, [O iii] and [N ii] images (Figure 7) of
PC 19 taken from IAC Catalog provide clues on morpholog-
ical features collectively. Both the Hα and [O iii] images de-
pict a bright central region, whereas, the [N ii] image clearly
shows a pair of ﬁlaments with a faint central region. The
ﬁlaments had been characterized as low ionization regions
(L´opez 1997; Guerrero et al. 1999; Gon¸calves et al. 2001),
i.e., they are more bright in low ionization lines, such as
[N ii]. Guerrero et al. (1999) studied the [N ii] (IAC Catalog
image) morphology and kinematics of PC 19 and described
the ﬁlaments as point symmetric arcs embedded in an ellip-
tical shell. They also pointed out a velocity ﬁeld increasing
outwards along the ﬁlaments, with outﬂow velocities ∼20-25
km s−1 and estimated a heliocentric velocity of 10 km s−1.
Gon¸calves et al. (2001) suggested the ﬁlaments to be outside
the central nebula with higher velocities than the environ-
ment. The high-resolution HST image in [N ii] (Figure 8(a))
clearly resolves the ﬁlament pair spiralling outward. A faint
diﬀused central structure is also seen, but without lobes or

Plasma Diagnostics

The physical conditions inside the nebulae are analysed us-
ing PyNeb package. We calculate [O iii], [N ii], [S iii] electron
temperatures (Te) and [Ar iv], [Cl iii], [S ii] electron den-
sities (Ne). The results are shown in Table 7. We list the
electron temperatures and densities estimated by Cuisinier
et al. (1996) and Olgu´ın et al. (2012) for comparison. The
contribution of He i 4713 ˚A from [Ar iv] 4711 ˚A has been
subtracted before analysis, as done in case of PB 1 (Sec.
4.1.2). Figure 12 shows the Te-Ne map for the ions men-
tioned above. We observe variations among the temperatures
for the three diﬀerent ions. For the calculation of ionic abun-
dances, we adopt the values, Te ∼ 13500 K and ne ∼ 4700
cm−3. Using the direct method, the total elemental abun-
dances from CELs of N, O, Ne, Ar, S and Cl are calcu-
lated adopting the ICF expressions from Delgado-Inglada
et al. (2014). The calculated ionic abundances, total ele-
mental abundances and the ICF values are given in Table 8.
C/H cannot be calculated as no C lines are detected in our
spectrum.

4.2.3 Ionization Characteristics: Photoionization

Modeling

The photoionization model of PC 19 is diﬃcult to con-
struct with simple assumption of a spherical geometry due
the presence of the ﬁlament pair as morphological elements.
While we have tried to construct the model with one compo-
nent spherical geometry, we have found that neither a high-
density nor a low-density model could simultaneously repro-
duce all the characteristic observables of the PN, e.g., Hβ
ﬂux, the continuum, and the characteristic lower to higher
ionization line ratios. Thus, at ﬁrst, to qualitatively ob-
tain all the characteristic observables in our photoionization
model, we attempt to construct a two-component model.
A low-density component with closed spherical geometry
is considered to represent the central structure. To repre-
sent the ﬁlaments, we consider a high-density component
having open geometry and an appropriate covering factor.
In each iteration, the parameters characterizing the central
star (temperature, luminosity and gravity) and the nebular
abundance values are kept same for both the components,
while the nebular parameters, such as, hydrogen density,
radii, ﬁlling factor, etc., are diﬀerent. The output model
spectra (in absolute ﬂuxes) from the two components are
directly summed to obtain the total model spectrum.

From the 3D morphological model it could be seen that
the ﬁlaments cover very low fraction of space around the cen-
tral star. This guided us to use a very small covering factor
for the high-density component. In a Cloudy model, for any
change of covering factor of the ionized shell, the model ab-

5876, 6678, and 7065 ˚A) are prominently seen in the spec-
trum. Among the He ii lines, only He ii 4686 ˚A is prominent.
Among the CELs, we detect strong [O iii] 4959, 5007 ˚A and
the auroral [O iii] 4363 ˚A lines. [N ii] 6548, 6583 ˚A lines are
stronger compared to PB 1 and the auroral [N ii] 5755 ˚A is
also detected. Other prominently detected lines are [Ne iii]
3869 ˚A ,[Ar iii] 7136, 7751 ˚A, [S iii] 6312, 9069 ˚A, [Cl iv]

[Cl iii] 5518, 5538 ˚A. We obtain c(Hβ) = 1.29, in order
to match the theoretical Balmer line ratio, Hα/Hβ, in the
dereddened spectrum. We measured the Hβ ﬂux through slit
to be, F (Hβ) = 2.64 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1.

dure as discussed in case of PB 1 (Sec. 4.1.3) to obtain a
satisfactory model. The comparison between the observed
and modelled ﬂuxes of the emission lines are given in Table
9. The lines particularly focussed on for ﬁtting the photoion-
ization model include He i 5876 ˚A, He ii 4686 ˚A, [O i] 6364
˚A, [O ii] 3727 ˚A, [O iii] 5007, 4363 ˚A, [N ii] 6583, 5755 ˚A,

4740 ˚A, [Ar iii] 7136 ˚A, [Cl iii] 5518, 5538 ˚A, [Cl iv] 8045 ˚A.
We also aim to carefully match the plasma diagnostic line
ratios, [O iii] 5007/4363, [N ii] 6583/5755, [S iii] 9069/6312,
[S ii] 6731/6716, [Ar iv] 4740/4711 and [Cl iii] 5538/5518.
However, the ratios, [S iii] 9069/6312, [Ar iv] 4740/4711 and
[Cl iii] 5538/5518 are not reproduced well by our model. The
lines of [O i] and [S ii] lines are slightly underestimated in
our model.

The ﬁfth and sixth columns of Table 9 show the con-
tribution of the low-density component (central structure)
and the high-density component (ﬁlaments), respectively, to
the total model emission line ﬂuxes. From best-ﬁtting model,
we ﬁnd that the low-density component and the high-density
component contribute 75% and 25% of the total model Hβ
ﬂux, respectively.

We obtain a satisfactory match of the modelled contin-
uum and the absolute line ﬂuxes with their observed val-
ues. The absolute Hβ ﬂux, Log I(Hβ) = −10.79, obtained
from model, matches satisfactorily with the observed value
of Log I(Hβ) = −10.91. The goodness of ﬁt of the model is
obtained by calculating r.m.s value of the ﬁt. We calculate
a value of 0.21, within the considerable range. The quality
of ﬁt of individual emission lines, measured with a quality
factor (κi), as described earlier, is given in Table 9.

From the best-ﬁtting model, we ﬁnd eﬀective tempera-
ture of the central star to be 92000 K, close to that estimated
by Stanghellini et al. (2002) (Teﬀ = 88920 K). Central star
gravity is estimated as Log g = 5.8 cm s−2. The low- and
high-density components are estimated to have densities of
∼4000 cm−1 and ∼10000 cm−3, respectively. Similar to PB
1, due to the presence of ﬁlling factor in the model, the si-
multaneous measurements of distance (and radii), luminos-
ity and ﬁlling factor may involve degeneracy. The estimation
of these parameters is described in Sec. 4.2.4.

solute ﬂux values vary linearly, but the line ﬂux ratios in the
output model spectrum (considering one-component model)
do not change considerably. In case of a two-component
model as we have considered for PC 19, due to any change of
covering factor of the high-density component, the line ﬂux
ratios in the total model spectrum (sum of contributions
from the low- and high-density components) also change.
Thus, an independent estimation of the covering factor from
the morphology helps to put constrain on covering factor
in the Cloudy model. From an approximate calculation of
the radial extent and average cross-section of the ﬁlaments,
we ﬁnd that the covering factor of the high-density compo-
nent should be ∼1% or ∼0.01. We varied the covering factor
slightly around 0.01 and compared the model spectrum with
the observed spectrum. Finally, from visual inspection, we
adopt 0.01 as the value of covering factor of the high-density
component in our model.

Figure 13 shows the ﬁt of the observed spectrum with
the model spectrum. We followed the similar ﬁtting proce-

Figure 13. The observed optical spectrum (grey solid line) and the modelled spectrum (red dashed line) are shown for PC 19. Prominent
emission lines are marked. Fluxes are in absolute scale. The vertically zoomed spectrum (lower panel) shows the ﬁt of the weaker lines
and the continuum clearly. See Section 4.2.3 for details.

In Table 8, we present the abundance values estimated
from photoionization modelling and those obtained using di-
rect method (Sec. 4.2.2). We show the abundance values ob-
tained by Cuisinier et al. (1996) (hereafter C96), Stanghellini
et al. (2006) (hereafter S06) and Olgu´ın et al. (2012) (here-
after O12) for comparison. We also list the ionic abundances
and ICF values calculated for obtaining the total abundances
from direct method, and the model ionic fractions of the el-
ements along with the corresponding ICF values in Table
8.

Our estimated abundances match well with other stud-
ies. However, few mismatches are there. For example, our
estimated N/H from model and direct method (using ICF)
are slightly higher than that obtained by C96, S06 and O12.
In case of O/H, our values (from model and direct method)
are slightly lower than the other estimations. The Ar/H ob-
tained using ICF in our analysis is about half compared
to our model value and also to the other estimations. Our
model value of Ne/H is ∼1.5 times higher than our estimated
value using ICF. Cl/H obtained from our model is slightly
higher than our estimated value using ICF and also than
the other estimations. We could not constrain C/H for PC
19 by photoionization modelling since no C lines are present
in our spectrum. We kept the C abundance constant at so-
lar value (Grevesse et al. 2010) throughout the modelling.
We ﬁnd no previous estimation of C/H, Ne/H and S/H to
compare with our results.

While computing the photoionization model, we con-
sider few probable aspects to verify the feasibility of the
photoionization model due to the presence of low ionization
ﬁlaments. We discuss this below. The low ionization lines
such as [N ii], are generally much stronger in most of the
PNe with low ionization structures (LISs). Though abun-
dance enhancement was proposed as a reason for this (e.g.,
Balick et al. 1993), more recently it was showed that the
enhancement of low ionization lines in LISs are not neces-

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

sarily due to abundance enhancement, but might be predom-
inantly due to shock excitation (e.g., Gon¸calves et al. 2009;
Akras & Gon¸calves 2016). The latter also showed that the
regions of LISs have similar or lower electron densities as the
surrounding nebula, whereas, theoretical models (e.g., Do-
pita 1997; Steﬀen et al. 2001) predict the density in the LISs
to be higher than the rest of the nebula. The justiﬁcation
was given that while the theoretical model densities repre-
sent the total densities from atomic, ionic, dust and molec-
ular contribution, the electron densities only correspond to
ionized fractions. Although LISs are present, the low ioniza-
tion lines (e.g., [N ii]) are not particularly strong in PC 19
as compared to many other PNe with such characteristics
(e.g., Guerrero et al. 1999). However, Guerrero et al. (1999)
showed that [N ii]/Hα ratio increases by 11.23 in the ﬁla-
ments than in the central region. However, no abundance
enhancement of N was noticed for this PN in any previ-
ous N/H estimation, viz. C96; S06; O12 (mentioned earlier),
where the abundances of nitrogen were similar to that es-
timated in this work using direct method (Sec. 4.2.2). We
also inspected whether PC 19 seem to fall in the category
where photoionization dominates the shock excitation. Pre-
sumably, the more shock excitation would dominate pho-
toionization, when the velocity is higher, temperature & lu-
minosity of the ionizing source is lower and the region un-
der consideration is nearer the central star. We took the set
of models computed by Raga et al. (2008) for a cloudlet
moving with a velocity, vc = 100 km s−1. The model with
highest ionization (C100) was computed with the parame-
ters, central source temperature, Teﬀ = 7 × 104; luminos-
ity, L = 5000L(cid:12); distance of the nebula from the ionizing
source, D = 3 × 1017 cm. Comparing these values with our
model parameters, i.e., temperature, luminosity and inner
radii of both the nebular components, it is evident that the
model would fall in the category where photoionization dom-
inates shock excitation.

In the previous studies, distance to this PC 19 had been es-
timated in a wide range; e.g., 5.715 (Cahn et al. 1992), 6.89
(Zhang 1995), 2.55 (Phillips 2002), 6.75 (Phillips 2004), 4.4
(Stanghellini et al. 2006), 10.390 (Stanghellini et al. 2008),
and 4.002±0.8 kpc (Stanghellini & Haywood 2010). To sum-
marize, the distance has been estimated in a range of 2.55
to 10.39 kpc.

Similar modelling approach, as described in case of PB
1 (Sec. 4.1.4), is followed in order to estimate distance,
radii, luminosity and ﬁlling factor. However, unlike PB 1,
PC 19 has complex morphology comprising highly bipolar
central structure (low-density component) and spiral ﬁla-
ments (high-density component), the regions deﬁning the
inner and outer radii are not clear. We approximately mea-
sure rin at the average of major and minor axis of the central
structure and use the same rin value for the ﬁlaments. We
kept the rout values of both the components as free parame-
ters and varied within a range such that the model nebular
size remained within the same order of the observed nebu-
lar extent. After computing a large number of models, we
adopted a distance of 5.0 kpc, within the literature value.
We estimated a luminosity of 6700 L(cid:12). We initially adopt
ﬁlling factors, fh = 1.0 and fl = 0.5 for the high- and low-
density components in the model, respectively, and slightly
varied close to those values. Finally, the values remained un-
altered in the best-ﬁtting model, hence, obtaining fh = 1.0
and fl = 0.5.

Theoretically, these model estimated values are degen-
erate with another model with the parameters, d = x × 5.0
kpc, L = x2 ×6700 L(cid:12) and fh = 1.0/x and fl = 0.5/x. From
Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) we used the values computed for
‘H-burning PNN evolutionary models’ (Z = 0.016) and ﬁnd
a relation between the age (t) and the luminosity (L) of the
progenitor for Teﬀ = 92000 K as,

Log(t) = 12.4599 − 2.36256 × Log(L/L(cid:12))

(6)

We assume the nebular expansion velocity, vexp = 50 km
s−1, obtained for the central structure in the 3D model, we
obtain a nebular age of 1421 yr, considering rout = 0.073 as
the edge of the nebula. Thus, for the degenerate model, we
have t = x × 3700 yr, along with L/L(cid:12) = x2 × 6700, leading
to the relation,

Log(t) = 1.24 + 0.5 × Log(L/L(cid:12))

(7)

Solving equations 6 and 7, we obtain a luminosity of 8309
L(cid:12), with x = 1.1136, thereby giving, d = 5.57 kpc, fh = 0.9
and fl = 0.45. For d = 5.57 kpc, the value of inner radii for
both the nebular components to compute the photoioniza-
tion model are set at rin = 0.029 pc.

4.3 Progenitor Mass

We estimate the mass of the central star of the PN, using H
burning post-AGB model tracks (Log (L/L(cid:12)) vs. Log (Teﬀ ))
(corresponding to Z = 0.016) from Vassiliadis & Wood
(1994) (Figure 14). They considered mass-loss based on em-
pirical mass-loss rates of PNe progenitors and radiation-
pressure-driven stellar wind theory, and calculated models
for diﬀerent initial masses and metallicities. Each track is
labelled in the format (X, Y), where, ‘X’ corresponds to the

Wood (1994) (Z = 0.016). The label at the beginning of each

value of initial (main-sequence) mass and ‘Y’ to the core
mass at Log (Teﬀ ) = 4, in terms of solar masses. We place
the two PNe on the model tracks at the coordinates (Log
(L/L(cid:12)), Log (Teﬀ )) corresponding to our estimated values
of temperature and luminosity of the central stars from pho-
toionization modelling. By interpolating, we estimate masses
of ∼1.67 and ∼2.38 M(cid:12) for the progenitors of PB 1 and PC
19, respectively.

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we present the result of our study of two less-
studied PNe, PB 1 and PC 19. For both the PNe, we study
the morphology and ionization characteristics by comput-
ing models that are satisfactorily constrained by the obser-
vations. For each PN, we reconstruct 3D morphology from
the 2D image using SHAPE and compute photoionization
models by ﬁtting the observed spectra using CLOUDY. We
ﬁnd that the projection of the 3D morphology matches well
with the observed image. Our best-ﬁtting photoionization
models match the observed spectra, including the contin-
uum, absolute Hβ ﬂux and the relative line ﬂuxes well. The
r.m.s. values of the models of both PB 1 and PC 19 are
well below unity, which reﬂects the goodness of ﬁt of the
models. The assumed shell geometry used in the photoion-
ization models are guided by the morphological information
derived from the 3D modelling. This improves the ﬁtting
of the photoionization models signiﬁcantly. We compute a
photoionization model for PC 19, without considering any
shock excitation scenario or overabundance of N for the low
ionization components. Several physical parameters are ob-
tained self-consistently from the models. From the 3D mod-
els, we estimate the relative dimensions of the structural

components and their orientation angles and expansion ve-
locities. We estimate temperature, luminosity and gravity of
the central star and nebular elemental abundances from the
photoionization models. We estimate distance to the PNe as
∼4.3 kpc for PB 1 and ∼5.6 kpc for PC 19.

According to our 3D model, PB 1 consists of a point
symmetric inner shell, surrounded by a bipolar halo. Our
morphological study reveals that the stellar wind might had
directionality since the early phases of post-AGB evolution,
as evident from the bipolarity of the halo. The overall nature
of the inner shell structure obtained from the 3D analysis is
physically similar with the apparent 2D morphology. Both
of them imply a point symmetric outﬂow of the fast wind.
The morphology of PC 19 consists of a central structure in
an open lobe bipolar morphology with a pair of ﬁlamentary
arms. The spiral arms are contained within the lobes of the
nebula. The top view of the model of PC 19 seems to have
similarity with image of NGC 6881 (SMV11) as observed
from Earth. We obtain the velocity ﬁeld in the ﬁlamentary
arms of PC 19 from the PV diagrams. While the blueward
arm shows a monotonically increasing velocity proﬁle, the
proﬁle for the redward arm depicts a sudden rise in the outer
region of the ﬁlaments.

The aim of our 3D modelling approach in this work
has been to obtain a 3D structure with possible components
that would reproduce the observed image satisfactorily. We
do not attempt to estimate the parameters, such as, dimen-
sions, expansion velocity, position and inclination angles of
the components, very accurately as that would had been
subjected to the degeneracy while measuring the parame-
ters simultaneously. The comparison of the observed and the
modelled images are done with eye-estimation. However, the
models might be subject to a collective error in the range
of ∼15-20%, estimated by noting deviations of the modelled
images that closely match the observed image.

Overall, our photoionization model results match with
the observations. In our modelling approach, large number
of models were generated by varying the parameters, the
best-ﬁtting model was chosen subsequently. However, degen-
eracy may occur for a diﬀerent set of model parameters. This
might be resolved using independent information about the
parameters and comparison with more model spectra gen-
erated by varying the parameters in smaller steps. It is very
complicated process to estimate the error, more precisely,
associated with individual model parameters. By running
large number of models, changing the parameters around
their estimated values, and noting deviation of the observ-
ables from the acceptable range, the error associated with
the parameters could be calculated.

Further, during observations, the slit was placed along
the central region of the nebulae (as shown in Figures 1 and
8). This might have led to some consequences on the re-
sults. As we consider a spherical photoionization model to
reproduce the observations, the emission from outer region
might have been overweighted compared to the observations.
Moreover, within the nebula, higher ionization states are
distributed towards the central region and lower ionization
ones towards the outer regions. As a result, the He ii lines
might have been enhanced in the observed spectrum and
led to a higher estimation of Teﬀ . Also, the discrepancies be-
tween the ICFs calculated from photoionization modelling
and those calculated from direct method might be due to

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

this aperture eﬀect (Morisset 2017), which has led to dis-
crepancies between model abundances and the abundances
estimated using ICFs. Interestingly, for N, O and Ne abun-
dances, we ﬁnd that this discrepancy is lower in PC 19 than
in PB 1. This is in line with the fact that higher percentage
of nebula is covered by the slit during our observation of
PC 19 compared to PB 1. More observations at diﬀerent slit
positions and a 3D photoionization model (e.g., Akras et al.
2016; Gesicki et al. 2016) may help to yield more precise
results.

The higher abundances of elements, particularly of He,
C and N, in PN indicate towards higher progenitor mass and
bipolar morphology (e.g., Stanghellini et al. 2002, Phillips
2003). The abundance, C/H, estimated for PB 1 in this
work, is quite high, He/H and N/H are also towards the
higher side. This is in line with the result that the estimated
progenitor mass for PB 1 ∼1.67 M(cid:12) is towards the high-
mass range (starting from ∼2 M(cid:12)) found in literature. In
case of PC 19, the morphology is highly bipolar. We ob-
tain a progenitor mass of ∼2.38 M(cid:12), which is above the
high-mass range of PN progenitors. However, the estimated
abundances of He, C, N and O in PC 19 are lower than their
average values found in bipolar PNe (Phillips 2003). Further
investigation is needed to resolve this contradiction.

As the reliability of a model depend upon the con-
strains available through observations, there are much scope
of improvements through observational perspective. More
PV diagram in various orientation of the slits are needed
to constrain the morphology with conﬁdence. Deep high-
resolution spectra of the objects may help to estimate weak
line ﬂuxes and measure the electron temperatures and den-
sities precisely. More detailed morphologies to represent the
non-spherical structures such as spiral, bipolar lobes, etc., in
place of simpliﬁed geometries could be used as the input for
the photoionization models, which may improve the overall
balance of diﬀerent ionization states in the model.
