On the ordering of credibility factors

Abstract

Traditional credibility analysis of risks in insurance is based on the random eﬀects model, where the
heterogeneity across the policyholders is assumed to be time-invariant. One popular extension is the
dynamic random eﬀects (or state-space) model. However, while the latter allows for time-varying
heterogeneity, its application to the credibility analysis should be conducted with care due to the
possibility of negative credibilities per period [see Pinquet (2020a)]. Another important but under-
explored topic is the ordering of the credibility factors in a monotonous manner—recent claims
ought to have larger weights than the old ones. This paper shows that the ordering of the covariance
structure of the random eﬀects in the dynamic random eﬀects model does not necessarily imply
that of the credibility factors. Subsequently, we show that the state-space model, with AR(1)-type
autocorrelation function, guarantees the ordering of the credibility factors. Simulation experiments
and a case study with a real dataset are conducted to show the relevance in insurance applications.

1. Introduction

Insurers use credibility theory to adjust a policyholder’s premium based on past claim history.
Typically, the a priori risk premium is ﬁrst determined by the policyholder’s observable risk char-
acteristics. Then the a posteriori premium is expressed as weighted sums of the past claims, and
these weights are called credibility factors. The baseline model that underlies many of the early
contributions in credibility theory is the static random eﬀects model.
In this case, a posteriori
premium is expressed as a weighted sum of two terms: the sample mean and a priori risk premium.
Consequently, a posteriori premium imposes the same credibility factors to each claim regardless
of its seniority. Motivated by this downside of the time-invariant credibility factors, the literature
has considered the age of claims by imposing geometric decreasing credibility factors (Gerber and
Jones, 1973; Gerber et al., 1975; Sundt, 1988).4

An alternative way to account for the seniority of the claims is through the introduction of the
dynamic random eﬀects rather than static random eﬀects [Bolanc´e et al. (2003)]. Subsequently, the
seniority of the claims is indirectly considered by allowing the dependence between random eﬀects
to decrease as time lag increases. These models fall within the scope of state-space models (SSM)
and are computationally intensive to deal with. In particular, they do not allow for closed-form
conditional expectation in general, which may make them computationally inconvenient for a pos-
teriori ratemaking [e.g., Brouhns et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2020)]. Furthermore, computing the
conditional expectation requires the full speciﬁcation of the dynamics of the unobserved random
eﬀect process, which may give rise to more mis-speciﬁcation risk. Consequently, the forecasting in
the dynamic random eﬀect model is often approximated by the credibility premium. However, not
all dynamic random eﬀects models lead to sensible credibility premium in the insurance perspective.
Recently, Pinquet (2020a) shows that the credibility coeﬃcients associated with these models are
not necessarily ensured to be non-negative. More precisely, Pinquet (2020a) shows that in Pois-
son dynamic random eﬀects models where the random eﬀect has an AR(p)-type auto-covariance
function, the non-negativity condition is not satisﬁed without parametric constraints on the auto-
covariance function.5 This result has important implications as it demonstrates the limitations of
the credibility approach when used semi-parametrically, that is when actuarial meaningfulness is
not considered.

This study furthers this investigation of dynamic random eﬀects models, in a similar spirit as
Pinquet (2020a). We focus on another important but thus far overlooked property of whether the
credibility factors are decreasing in seniority. While this property is a motivation of the dynamic
random eﬀects in actuarial perspective [e.g., Pinquet et al. (2001); Bolanc´e et al. (2003); Lu (2018)],
until now, it has not been formally checked in the literature. We start our analysis with a simple
question: does a decreasing auto-correlation function (ACF) of the dynamic random eﬀect suﬃce
for the resulting credibility coeﬃcients to be also decreasing in seniority? We show that this is
generically not the case. This leads us to restrict our attention to dynamic random eﬀect processes
with AR(1) autocorrelation such as those introduced by (Grunwald et al., 2000). Under such
an auto-correlation restriction, we show that the corresponding credibility factor is an increasing

4These papers, however, do not allow for individual-speciﬁc and potentially time-varying risk exposure and are

thus unsuitable for many real applications.

5More recently, in a follow-up work, Pinquet (2020b) shows that an ARFIMA(0,d,0) type auto-correlation of the
dynamic random eﬀects is compatible with the positivity of the credibility coeﬃcients. However, the latter paper
does not provide examples of positive processes with ARFIMA(0,d,0) representation.

function of time as well as being non-negative.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to the dynamic
random eﬀects models and credibility theory. In particular, we demonstrate that the ordering of
the covariance does not always guarantee that of the credibility factor. Section 3 provides the
speciﬁc formulation of the dynamic random eﬀects model, which is guaranteed to have the ordered
credibility factors. In Section 4, we perform a numerical study under various parameter settings.
In Section 5, an empirical analysis is conducted on a real-life dataset.

2. The general setting and motivating examples

This section provides a quick reminder of the general setting, the deﬁnition of the credibility
coeﬃcients, and two motivating examples for which the credibility coeﬃcients are not monotonously
ordered.

2.1. Notation and deﬁnition

Let us assume that for each individual i, we observe claim-related variables Yi,t for policy year

t = 1, ..., Ti. We denote the history of claims up to time Ti by

Fi,Ti := (cid:8)Yi,t

(cid:12)
(cid:12) t = 1, . . . , Ti, (cid:9) ,

and assume that the sequence (Yi,t : t = 1, 2, · · · ) is independent across diﬀerent individuals i. In
posterior ratemaking, it is interesting to predict Yi,Ti+1 for each policyholder i and upcoming year
Ti + 1, which is given as

E [Yi,Ti+1|Fi,Ti] .

(1)

For the expository purpose, from now onward, we remove subscript i.

We say that a sequence of stationary random variables (Yt : t = 1, 2, · · · ) has positive covariance

ordering if the autocovariance function (ACF) is decreasing in lag:

Cov [Yt, Yt+p] > Cov [Yt, Yt+q] ,

for all p, q, t = 1, 2, · · ·

(2)

satisfying p < q.

For the distributional assumption of the observed claims, we consider the reproductive exponen-
tial dispersion family (EDF) by McCullagh and Nelder (1989). They show a real-valued random
variable Y as belonging to the reproductive exponential dispersion model with mean parameter
u and dispersion parameter ψ denoted by ED (u, ψ) and has a density function at Y = y of the
following form

h(y; u, ψ) exp

(cid:18) θy − A(θ)
ψ

(cid:19)

.

Here, h is a suitable normalizing term, and A is twice a continuously diﬀerentiable function satis-
fying

θ = (cid:0)A(cid:48)(cid:1)−1 (u).

If Y ∼ ED (u, ψ), we have

where V , called the unit variance function, is deﬁned by

E [Y ] = u and Var (Y ) = V (u)ψ

(cid:17)
V (u) = A(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:16)(cid:0)A(cid:48)(cid:1)−1 (u)

.

This study utilizes the following examples of distributions in EDF:

3

• Pois(λ): the Poisson distribution6 with parameter λ;

• Gamma(λ, ψ): the gamma distribution7 with mean λ and variance λ2ψ.

We use Beta(a, b) to denote the beta distribution with parameters a, b.
Finally, we also deﬁne three T × T matrices. We denote by I T the identity matrix, ET the

matrix of 1, and ΣT,ρ the Toeplitz matrix whose entries are given by

where ρ ∈ (−1, 1). We recall the following well-known result concerning its inverse matrix:

[ΣT,ρ]i,j = ρ|i−j|,

i, j = 1, · · · , T.

(1 − ρ2) (ΣT,ρ)−1 =

or

(i, j) = (1, 1),
(i, j) (cid:54)= (1, 1), (i, j) (cid:54)= (T, T ),
j = i + 1
otherwise.

j = i − 1;

or

and i = j;

2.2. Brief reminder of the credibility theory

While the conditional expectation in (1) is the best forecast in terms of the mean squared error
(MSE), it can be problematic to communicate with the policyholders if it does not allow the closed
form solution (Goulet, 1998). Alternatively, the credibility premium provides the eﬃcient yet intu-
itive aﬃne functional form of the premium, which facilitates communication with the policyholders.
Formally, for a sequence of random variables (Yt; t = 1, 2, · · · ) satisfying E [Yt] = λt, the credibility
premium for time T + 1 is deﬁned by

Prem (Y1, · · · , YT ) := (cid:98)α0λT +1 + (cid:98)α1Y1 + · · · + (cid:98)αT YT

where

((cid:98)α0, · · · , (cid:98)αT ) :=

arg min
(α0,··· ,αT )∈RT +1

(YT +1 − (α0λT +1 + α1Y1 + · · · + αT YT ))2(cid:105)
(cid:104)

.

(5)

Here, (cid:98)αt for t = 1, · · · , T is referred to as the credibility factor, which can be interpreted as the
contribution of t-th year observation to the credibility premium. This credibility premium, which is
the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of E [YT +1|FT ], can be computed through [see B¨uhlmann
and Gisler (2006)]:

6For Poisson distribution, the corresponding dispersion parameter is ψ = 1, and the corresponding unit variance

function is given by V (µ) = µ.

7Here, ψ is dispersion parameter, and the corresponding unit variance function is given by V (µ) = µ2.

where ΣT is a T × T covariance matrix deﬁned by

We say that the credibility premium is regular if

[ΣT ]i,j = Cov [Yi, Yj]

(cid:98)αt > 0,

for

t = 1, . . . .

We note that negative credibility factors are highly undesirable for regulatory reasons, as they might
give the wrong incentives of making claims to get lower premiums or even give rise to negative
premiums, which is the synonym of arbitrage opportunities [e.g., Pinquet (2020a), Li et al. (2020)].
For the condition of the regular credibility premium, we refer to the study of Pinquet (2020a,b).

The following example shows the property of credibility factors under the static random eﬀects

model.

Example 1 (Static random eﬀects model). For a distribution function G, consider a random eﬀect
R ∼ G so that Yj’s are conditionally independent for given R. Subsequently, after integrating the
random eﬀect, we obtain the joint distribution of (Y1, · · · , YT , YT +1). However, random eﬀects mod-
els may not be ideal for the posterior ratemaking in insurance products mainly due the symmetric
dependence structure. Consequently, old claims are equally treated as new claims in the determina-
tion of future premiums, which is clearly counterintuitive. More precisely, as the covariance matrix
in (6) has the equi-covariance structure,8 the following identity holds:

(cid:98)α1 = · · · = (cid:98)αT .
Clearly, the credibility premium having the credibility factors of the form in (8) is counterintuitive
when applied to insurance ratemaking, in the sense that the weight of old claims, for example, (cid:98)α1,
is the same as the weight of new claims, for example, (cid:98)αT .

(8)

More realistically, one may depart from the equi-covariance assumption and consider a series of
random variables (Yt : t = 1, 2, · · · ) speciﬁed as follows, which has the positive covariance ordering
as in (2).

Example 2 (Dynamic random eﬀects model). Let us consider a dynamic random eﬀects (or state-
space) model comprising an unobserved process (Rt : t = 0, 1, · · · ) (called state variable) and an
observed process (Yt
: t = 1, 2, · · · ). We also assume that for t varying, Yt’s are independent
conditionally on (Rt : t = 1, 2, · · · ), and their distribution depends on Rt only. Consequently, the
joint density function of (Y1:T , R0:T ) can be expressed as

f (y1:T , r0:T ) = f (r0)

T
(cid:89)

t=1

f (yt|rt)f (rt|rt−1) .

In other words, such a model has the causal chain:

· · · −→ Rt−1 −→ Rt −→ Rt+1 −→ · · ·
↓
↓
↓
· · ·
Yt
· · ·

↓
Yt−1

↓
Yt+1

(9)

8We assume that marginal distributions are the same.

Consequently, the speciﬁcation of the random eﬀects model (Y1:T , R0:T ) boils down to the speci-

ﬁcation of

i. The dynamics of the sequence (Rt : t = 0, 1, . . .).
ii. The conditional distribution of Yt for given Rt for each t.

Assuming that the sequence (rt : t = 1, 2, · · · ) has the positive covariance ordering, it is natural
to ask whether more recent observations have more inﬂuence than the old observations in the
determination of the premium—whether we have

(cid:98)α1 ≤ · · · ≤ (cid:98)αT .

(10)

under the framework of credibility theory. It will be shown in the next subsection that the positive
covariance ordering of (Yt) or (Rt) is not suﬃcient to guarantee (10).

2.3. Some motivating state-space counter-examples

This subsection provides two motivating examples of the stationary dynamic random eﬀects
model (Yt), which has a positive covariance ordered random eﬀects (Rt), without the credibility
coeﬃcients being monotonically decreasing in seniority.

Example 3 (Semi-parametric model). Let us ﬁrst consider the ﬁrst dynamic random eﬀects model
pioneered by Bolanc´e et al. (2003). This model is semi-parametric in the sense that the auto-
covariance of the dynamic random eﬀect process is not constrained. We set σ2 = 1, and take the
estimate of the auto-correlation function from their paper (see their Table 1):

ρ1 = .733, ρ2 = .524, ρ3 = .504, ρ4 = .483, ρ5 = .401.

Then we compute the credibility coeﬃcients with time invariant λt = 1, to obtain the credibility
coeﬃcients which are equal to

if T = 3, or:

if T = 4, or:

Example 4 (A parametric model). The previous example shows the importance of putting con-
straints on the autocorrelation function of the dynamic random eﬀect process rather than leaving it
unconstrained. Let us now inspect a parametric model with a simple autocorrelation function.

Consider a state-space model that comprises a state process (Rt : t = 0, 1, . . .) and observable

time series (Yt : t = 1, 2, . . .) of the following form:

i. The conditional distribution of Yt for given Rt := (Rt,1, Rt,2) is

Yt|Rt ∼ ED (λt (Rt,1 + Rt,2) , ψ) .

ii. (Rt,1 : t = 0, 1, . . .) and (Rt,2 : t = 0, 1, . . .) are independent processes such that (Rt,1 : t =

0, 1, . . .) has AR(1)-type autocorrelation:

E [Rt,1] = 1, Var (Rt,1) = σ2
1,

and Cov [Rt1,1, Rt2,1] = σ2

1ρ|t2−t1|,

t, t1, t2 ∈ N0,

(11)

and Rt,2 is time-invariant:

E [Rt,2] = 1, Var (Rt,2) = σ2
2,

and Cov [Rt1,2, Rt2,2] = σ2
2,

t, t1, t2 ∈ N0.

(12)

Models involving both time-invariant and time-varying random eﬀects have previously been con-
sidered by Pinquet (2020a). Note that here, the process (Rt,1 + Rt,2) is stationary but is generically
non-Markov.

We can easily check that

Var (Yt) = ψE [V (Rt,1 + Rt,2)] + (Var (Rt,1) + Var (Rt,2)) ,

and

Cov [Yt1, Yt2] = σ2

1ρ|t1−t2| + σ2
2.

When ψ = 0, the covariance matrix of (Y1, · · · , YT ) has the same structure as in (B.5). Conse-

quently, ψ → 0, Lemma 2 in Appendix B shows the following inequality

which clearly shows that the credibility factors do not satisfy the increasing property in (10).
For a numerical illustration, we assume identity variance function V and set parameters

(cid:98)α1 > (cid:98)αj,

j = 2, · · · , t − 1

(13)

and

σ2
1 = 1,

ρ = 0.8,

λt = 1,
Table 1 shows the credibility factors for T = 5 for various combinations of ψ and σ2
we have

t = 0, 1, · · · .

2. As expected,

under Scenarios I and II with small ψ = 0.01 and 0.1, respectively.

However, under Scenarios III and IV, which correspond to the relatively large value of ψ = 1,

we have the ordering of the credibility factors in (10).9

(cid:98)α1 > (cid:98)αt,

t = 2, · · · , 4

9In the case where σ2

2 = 0 with identity variance function V , the covariance matrix of (Y1, · · · , YT ) has the same
structure as that of Model 1. Hence, Theorem 1 in the later section implies the ordering of the credibility factors in
(10).

Remark 1. It is well known that the credibility model is equivalent to regressing Xt on its lagged
values. Therefore, the fact that the credibility coeﬃcients, or equivalently the regression coeﬃcients,
are not necessarily ordered corresponds to also a well-known issue in the time series literature.10
Let us, for instance, consider ARMA(1,1) process (Yt) deﬁned by

Yt = φYt−1 + et + θ − θet−1,

where (et) represents an unobserved white noise series with zero mean and variance σ2
the standard procedure, we have

e . Following

Var (Yt) =

1 − 2φθ + θ2
1 − φ2

σ2
e

and Cov [Yt, Yt+1] = φVar (Yt) − θσ2
e

and

Cov [Yt, Yt+k] = φCov [Yt, Yt+k−1] ,

for k ≥ 2.

Now, consider ARMA(1,1) process (Yt) with

(φ, θ, σ2

e ) = (0.5, −0.2, 1.0).

Clearly, (Yt) has positive covariance ordering. However, the ordering of the credibility factors in
(10) is not satisﬁed. For example, when T = 5, the credibility factors in (5) are given by

((cid:98)α1, · · · , (cid:98)α5) = (0.001, −0.006, 0.028, −0.140, 0.700),

which shows neither monotonically increasing nor monotonically decreasing pattern.

This issue has (partly) prompted the introduction of alternative time series models that ensure

the correct ordering, such as the Harvey-Fernandez model (see Section 3).

3. Ordering of credibility factors under the AR(1) state-space model

The examples in Section 2.3 show that the monotonicity of the ACF of the state process (Rt)
does not guarantee the ordering of the credibility factors corresponding to observable time series
(Yt).
In some sense, these counter-examples are not surprising, as Pinquet (2020a) has already
found examples for which positive ACF does not necessarily lead to positive credibility coeﬃcients.
In other words, for the credibility coeﬃcients to be “well behaved,” generally, further restrictions on
the ACF are required. This section discusses the ordering of credibility factors under the dynamic
random eﬀects model and shows that the dynamic random eﬀects model with the random eﬀects
having an AR(1)-type ACF ensures the ordering of the credibility coeﬃcients.

3.1. Model speciﬁcation and main result
Model 1 (AR(1) State-Space Model). 11 Consider a state-space model comprising a state process
(Rt : t = 0, 1, . . .) and observable time series (Yt : t = 1, 2, . . .) of the following form:

i. Conditional distribution of Yt for given Rt is

Yt|Rt ∼ ED (λtRt, ψ)

(14)

where ED (λtRt, ψ) denotes EDF with mean λtRt, dispersion parameter ψ, and variance func-
tion12 V (·).

ii. A state process (Rt : t = 0, 1, . . .) has stationary Markov property, and we further assume
E [Rt] = 1 for t = 0, 1, · · · . Owing to stationary property, Var (Rt)’s are time-invariant
constant, and we denote it as

Var (Rt) = σ2,

t = 0, 1, · · ·

for convenience.

iii. We further assume that the ACF satisﬁes13

Cov [Rt1, Rt2] = σ2ρ|t2−t1|,

t1 (cid:54)= t2

for t1, t2 = 0, 1, · · · .

(15)

(16)

It is straightforward to observe that the closed-form expression of the marginal mean and

variance of Yt is given by

E [Yt] = λt

and Var (Yt) = ψE [V (λtRt)] + λ2

t σ2,

and the marginal covariance of Yt1 and Yt2 is given by

Cov [Yt1, Yt2] = λt1λt2σ2ρ|t1−t2|,

t1 (cid:54)= t2.

(17)

(18)

We ﬁrst observe that the positive covariance ordering of (Yt) is not guaranteed depending on
the choice of λt’s. To ensure the positive covariance ordering of (Yt), we restrict our attention
to the standardized observations. Speciﬁcally, under the settings in Model 1, the standardized
observations is deﬁned as

Y ∗
t =

Yt
λt

,

t = 1, 2, · · · .

In particular, in insurance, standardized observations play a key role in ratemaking systems, and
premiums are often expressed in terms of the standardized observations (B¨uhlmann and Gisler,

11Notably, the whole distributional assumption in Model 1 can be replaced with the moment conditions in (17)
and (18) to give the same result to be presented in this section. However, we stick to the distributional assumption
in Model 1 for brevity.

12From the deﬁnition, we have E [Yt|Rt] = λtRt and Var (Yt|Rt) = ψV (λtRt).
13Examples of Markov processes (Rt : t = 0, 1, . . .) satisfying the correlation structure in (15) and (16) will be

provided in Section 3.2.

2006). For example, the credibility premium of YT +1 deﬁned in (4) can be equivalently represented
as

Prem (Y1, · · · , YT ) := (cid:98)α0 + (cid:98)α∗

1Y ∗

1 + · · · + (cid:98)α∗

T Y ∗
T ,

where

1 = λ1 (cid:98)α1, . . . , (cid:98)α∗
(cid:98)α∗

T = λT (cid:98)αT

(19)

(20)

with (cid:98)αt’s given by (5). We say the credibility premium is positively isotonic if

1 ≤ · · · ≤ (cid:98)α∗
(cid:98)α∗
T .
We emphasize the terminology “positive” here. While we say the sequence has the positive covari-
ance ordering if the ACF is decreasing function in time as in (2), we deﬁne the credibility premium
to be positively ordered if the credibility factors are increasing function in time as in (21).

(21)

We now have all the necessary ingredients to introduce the main result of the study. The
following theorem says that the monotonicity of the credibility coeﬃcients is necessarily satisﬁed
when the dynamic random eﬀect has an AR(1)-type ACF.

Theorem 1. Consider the time series (Yt) in the state-space model in Model 1 and assume that
(λ1:t) is time-invariant:

λ1 = · · · = λT .

(22)

Subsequently, the time series (Y ∗
sponding to the standardized observations are positively isotonic. Speciﬁcally, (cid:98)α∗
satisfy the following inequality

where the equality holds if and only if ρ = 0.

Proof. The proof for the positive covariance ordering of (Y ∗

obtained from (18). For the proof of the remaining part, see Appendix A.

(cid:3) = σ2ρ|t1−t2|,

We note that the investigation of the ordering of the credibility factors can be less meaningful if
(22) is not satisﬁed. If we do not assume (22), neither (Yt) nor (Y ∗
t ) is guaranteed to be stationary
so that discussion of the corresponding credibility factors can be void. Indeed, it will be shown
in Section 4.1 through a numerical study that the credibility factors change drastically according
to the choice of (λ1, · · · , λT ). Consequently, we conclude that the concept of positively isotonic
is more sensible with the condition in (22). In Appendix C, for the completeness of the paper,
we also provide results on the ordering of the credibility factors without assuming the condition in
(22).

3.2. Parametric examples

The class of time series satisfying the correlation structure in (16), which is characterized by

E [Rt|Rt−1] = φ1Rt−1 + φ2,

for real numbers φ1 and φ2, includes a wide range of AR(1) models (e.g., Grunwald et al. (2000)).
Let us now provide some examples.

10

Example 5 (Beta-Gamma autoregressive process of the ﬁrst-order (BGAR(1))). We say that
(Rt : t = 0, 1, · · · ) is a BGAR(1) [see Lewis et al. (1989)] with parameter (γ1, γ2, ρ) ∈ R3
+ if it
satisﬁes

Rt = BtRt−1 + Gt,

t = 0, 1, · · · ,

where (Bt : t = 0, 1, · · · ) and (Gt : t = 0, 1, · · · ) are mutually independent sequences of i.i.d. random
variables satisfying

Bt ∼ Beta (γ1ρ, γ1(1 − ρ))

and Gt ∼ Gamma

(cid:18) γ1(1 − ρ)
γ2

,

γ1(1 − ρ)

(cid:19)

,

t = 0, 1, · · · .

Subsequently, we remark that if Rt−1 ∼ Gamma(γ1/γ2, 1/γ1), then by the property of the beta
distribution, we have

BtRt−1 ∼ Gamma

(cid:19)

(cid:18) γ1ρ

γ1ρ

, and hence, the marginal distribution of Rt is given by
(cid:18) γ1

Rt ∼ Gamma

(cid:19)

Finally, the serial variance and covariance of (Rt) are obtained as

Var (Rt) =

γ2

and Cov [Rt, Rt−(cid:96)] = ρt−(cid:96) γ1
γ2
2

,

(cid:96) = 0, 1, · · · .

The following two examples of state-space model are described by a BGAR(1) with parameter
(γ1, γ2, ρ). For the identiﬁcation purpose, we assume that γ1 = γ2 = 1/σ2 so that E [Rt] = 1 and
Var (Rt) = σ2. Note that we also have E (cid:2)R3(cid:3) = (2σ2 + 1)(σ2 + 1).

Example 6 (A dynamic gamma-gamma model). Consider the state-space model in Model 1 with
observable time series (Yt : t = 1, 2, · · · ) and state variable (Rt : t = 1, 2, · · · ) with the following
speciﬁcation:

• (Rt : t = 1, 2, · · · ) is given by a BGAR(1) with parameter (γ, γ, ρ) with γ = 1/σ2.

• The observation Yt conditional on Rt is given by

Yt|Rt ∼ Gamma (λtRt, ψ) .

(23)

Subsequently, for t, t1, t2 ∈ N and t1 (cid:54)= t2, we have

E [Yt] = λt, Var (Yt) = λ2
t

(cid:0)ψ (cid:0)1 + σ2(cid:1) + σ2(cid:1) ,

and Cov [Yt1, Yt2] = λt1λt2ρ|t1−t2|σ2.

Furthermore, using Theorem 2 in Appendix A, (cid:98)α∗

1, . . . , (cid:98)α∗

T in (19) is obtained as

((cid:98)α∗

1, . . . , (cid:98)α∗

T ) = ρ (cid:0)1 − ρ2(cid:1) σ2λT +1vT (u1, . . . , uT )

1
(1 + σ2) ψ

,

(24)

where u1, . . . , uT and vT are deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1 in Appendix A. Clearly, the credibility premium
is regular. Furthermore, if λ1 = · · · = λT , the time series (Yt) has positive covariance ordering.
Finally, with the help of Lemma 1, the results in (24) clearly show that the credibility premium is
regular. This conﬁrms the result in Theorem 1.

11

Example 7 (A dynamic Poisson-gamma model). Consider the same state-space model in Model
1, where the distributional assumption in (23) is replaced by

Yt|Rt ∼ Pois (λtRt) .

(25)

Subsequently, for t, t1, t2 ∈ N and t1 (cid:54)= t2, we have

E [Yt] = λt, Var (Yt) = λt + λ2

t σ2,

and Cov [Yt1, Yt2] = λt1λt2σ2ρ|t1−t2|.
1, . . . , (cid:98)α∗

T in (19) are obtained as

Similar to Example 6, Theorem 2 in Appendix A shows that (cid:98)α∗

((cid:98)α∗

1, . . . , (cid:98)α∗

T ) = ρ (cid:0)1 − ρ2(cid:1) σ2λT +1vT (u1λ1, . . . , uT λT ) .

where u1, . . . , uT , and vT are deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1 in Appendix A. Clearly, the credibility premium
is regular. Furthermore, if λ1 = · · · = λT , the time series (Yt) has positive covariance ordering,
and credibility premium is positively isotonic by Lemma 1. This conﬁrms the result in Theorem 1.

Remark 2. Under certain circumstances, the credibility premium is guaranteed to be positively
isotonic without assuming time-invariant (λt) as in (22). Let us, for instance, reconsider Example
6. As the unit variance function of Gamma distribution is V (x) = x2, part ii of Corollary 1 in
Appendix C shows that the credibility premium is guaranteed to be positively isotonic without the
assumption in (22).

Similar ideas can be used to come up with the example whose (non-standard) credibility factors
are positively ordered without assuming (22). Consider the time series (Yt) in (7). As the unit
variance function of Poisson distribution is the identity function—V (x) = x—part i of Corollary 1
in Appendix C shows that the credibility factors satisfy

(cid:98)α1 ≤ · · · ≤ (cid:98)αT

regardless of the assumption in (22).

However, as we have already discussed, neither the time series (yt) nor (y∗

t ) is stationary.
Consequently, it is less meaningful to discuss the ordering of credibility factors without assuming
time-invariant (λt) as in (22).

Finally, note that besides BGAR(1) used in Examples 6 and 7, there are other stationary
processes with stationary, gamma distribution, as well as AR(1)-type auto-covariance function. In
the following, let us give two well-known examples.

Example 8 (Autoregressive gamma process (ARG)). The ARG process is the exact time-discretization
of the square-root diﬀusion process and has been introduced into the ratemaking literature by Lu
(2018). This process is Markov and is mostly conveniently speciﬁed through the conditional Laplace
transform:

E[exp(−sRt+1) | Rt] =

1

(1 + cs)δ exp

(cid:16)

−

ρs
1 + cs

(cid:17)

Rt

,

∀s ≥ 0,

(26)

where ρ ∈ [0, 1], and c, δ > 0. By taking ﬁrst derivative with respect to s, it is easily shown that
E[Rt+1|Rt] = ρRt + cδ.

As this model has the same auto-covariance function as the above BGAR(1) process, it gives

rise to the same credibility coeﬃcients in a state-space context.14

14See also Lu (2018) for the expression of Bayes premium when the response variable is conditionally Poisson and

Li et al. (2020) for numerical approximation methods in the general case.

12

Example 9 (Gamma autoregressive process). Gaver and Lewis (1980) consider the process (Rt)
deﬁned by

Rt+1 = ρRt + (cid:15)t+1,

where the innovation process ((cid:15)t) is i.i.d. They work out the distribution of the latter such that
process (Rt) is marginally gamma distributed. For this example, by deﬁnition, we have E[Rt+1|Rt] =
ρRt + E[(cid:15)t].

3.3. Comparison with Harvey and Fernandez’s approach

The dynamic, AR(1)-type random eﬀects model considered above is a state-space model with
an exogenous state process. In other words, the conditional distribution of Rt given the past of
both processes (Rt) and (yt) only depends on its own past but not on that of (yt). Alternatively,
the time series literature has also proposed state-space models with non-exogenous or endogenous
state process, which does not have the causal chain (9). One such example is the count time
series model of Harvey and Fernandes (1989), which has been applied in the actuarial literature by
Bolanc´e et al. (2007); Abdallah et al. (2016). This model, which is based on the Poisson-gamma
conjugacy, is such that at any time t, both the ﬁltering density Rt|(Y1, · · · , Yt) and the predictive
density Rt+1|(Y1, · · · , Yt) are gamma. More precisely, the joint dynamics of (Rt, yt : t = 0, 1, . . .) is
deﬁned as follows:

• (Initial value) R1 ∼ Gamma∗(a0, b0) with a0 = b0.

• (measurement equation) For each t,

Yt|(Rt, Rt−1, ..., Yt−1, ...) ∼ Pois (λtRt) ,

• (Updating formula) If

Rt|(Y1, · · · , Yt) = (y1, · · · , yt) ∼ Gamma∗(at, bt),

then the one-step-ahead conditional distribution of the random eﬀect is given by

Rt+1|(Y1, · · · , Yt) = (y1, · · · , yt) ∼ Gamma∗(αat, αbt)

(27)

for a time-invariant constant α ∈ (0, 1]. Moreover, these authors show that at and bt are some
aﬃne functions of (y1, · · · , yt).

Here, Gamma∗(a0, b0) denotes the gamma distribution with shape parameter a0 and rate parameter
b0.

A direct consequence of this speciﬁcation, and especially equation (27), is the following expo-

nential moving average predictive mean:

E [Yt+1|Y1, · · · , Yt] = λt+1

a0 +

(28)

As the conditional expectation is linear, the credibility forecast and the conditional expectation
coincide. Therefore, this is yet another model in which the credibility coeﬃcients form a decreasing
(indeed geometric) sequence.

13

The major diﬀerences between Model 1 and the model of Harvey and Fernandez are three-
fold. First, unlike Model 1, Harvey and Fernandes (1989)’s model is speciﬁc to the models with
conditional Poisson distribution.15 Second and more importantly, the dynamics of the random
eﬀects process (Rt : t = 0, 1, . . .) deﬁned in Harvey and Fernandes (1989) is nonstationary, in the
sense that the marginal distribution of Rt is not time-invariant., even when λt is time-variant. This
non-stationarity makes the interpretation of this model considerably unnatural. Finally, recently,
Boucher and Pigeon (2018) showed that, unlike random eﬀects type models, the Harvey-Fernandez
model has an undesirable numerical feature that the impact of a single claim for an insured is
excessively large for policyholders with a long driving experience. This makes it unappealing when
it comes to retaining loyal and good drivers.

4. Numerical study

This section performs numerical studies on the credibility factors with the proposed methodol-
ogy. First, in Section 4.1, we provide a numerical example showing that the state-space model in
Model 1 is not necessarily positively isotonic. Subsequently, in Section 4.2, we analyze credibility
premiums with the proposed model under various parameter settings in Model 1 and compare their
performances to those of the exact premium in (1).

4.1. Numerical examples of credibility premiums which are not positively isotonic

In Section 2.3, we show that the credibility premium under a state-space model is not necessarily
positively isotonic, although it has the decreasing covariance property. In this subsection, we show,
by example, that even a state-space model as in Model 1 can have credibility premiums that are
not positively isotonic. While Theorem 1 shows that credibility factors under the assumptions in
Model 1 are positively isotonic if time-invariant ﬁxed eﬀects are assumed, we may have credibility
factors that are not positively isotonic with time-varying ﬁxed eﬀects.

First, consider the credibility premium under the settings in Example 7 with t = 5, σ2 = 0.5,

and ψ = 0.5. For other parameters, consider the combination of ρ = 0.3, 0.6 and

(λ1, · · · , λ5) =






(1, 1, 1, 1, 1);
(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10);
(10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001);

with λ6 = 1. Table 2 shows the credibility factors calculated in (24).

Columns corresponding to Case 1.a and Case 2.a in Table 2 represent time-invariant ﬁxed
eﬀects. Clearly, credibility premiums in these cases are positively isotonic, which conﬁrms Theorem
1. However, by Case 1.b and 1.c, we show that the ordering of credibility factors can be aﬀected
by controlling the values of (λ1, · · · , λT ). Speciﬁcally, while the credibility premium in Case 1.b
is positively isotonic, the credibility premium in Case 1.c is not positively isotonic. This example
suggests that the fair comparison of the ordering of credibility factors should be based on the
assumption

We can observe a similar pattern of credibility factors in Case 2.b and 2.c.

λ1 = · · · = λT .

15Smith and Miller (1986) proposes a similar model for exponential observations and Gamma random eﬀects, but

the latter has not yet been applied to the insurance literature.

4.2. Calculation of credibility premiums under various parameter settings

We investigate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed credibility premium compared to
the exact premium in (1) and some industry benchmarks. Here, T = 5 and Yit for t = 1, . . . , 6 and
i = 1, . . . , 500 are generated as follows:

Yit|Rit ∼ Pois (λitRit) ,

λit = exp(−3 + 2Xit),

where Xit follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.6, and (Rt
: 0, 1, · · · ) is
BGAR(1) with parameters (γ, γ, ρ) with γ = 1/σ2 so that E [Rt] = 1 and Var (Rt) = σ2. With
this scheme, we generate eleven hypothetical datasets by varying the values of σ2 = 0, 1, 2 and
ρ = 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.0 to capture various scenarios of serial dependence within the claims of the
same policyholder. For example, if ρ = σ2 = 0, Yit marginally follows an independent Poisson
distribution. If ρ = 0 and σ2 > 0, then the Yit marginally follows a negative binomial distribution,
If ρ = 1, then Yit follows a
while there is no serial dependence among Yi,1, . . . , Yi,6 for each i.
usual static gamma random eﬀects model explained below. While Yit for t = 1, . . . , 5 are used as a
training set, Yi,6 is set aside as an out-of-sample validation set to assess the predictive performance
of each premium.

For the numerical comparison, we consider the following ways of premium calculation as bench-

marks under the framework in Model 1:

• Naive: premium without a posteriori ratemaking so that ˆµi,6 = ˆλi,6. Note that it is the true

premium when ρ = σ2 = 0 in the BGAR(1) model.

• Static: premium when, in the BGAR(1) model, the correlation ρ = 1—when Ri,1 = · · · = Ri,6
for all i. In other words, in this case, we have the usual static gamma random eﬀects model,
and standard conjugacy leads to

ˆµi,6 =

(cid:80)5

(cid:80)5

t=1 Yit + 1/σ2
ˆλit + 1/σ2

t=1

ˆλi,6.

Here, we estimated 1/σ2 using the method of moments. Alternatively, one can also use Hglm
package in R (R¨onneg˚ard et al., 2010) to ﬁnd the MLE of σ2 or the argument of prior elicitation
(Jeong, 2020).

15

• Exact: premium using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations16 to sample Ri,6

for i = 1, . . . , 500 so that

ˆµi,6 =

1
S

S
(cid:88)

s=1

ˆR(s)
i,6

ˆλi,6.

where ˆR(s)
i,6 , s = 1, . . . , S for each i are posterior samples of Ri,6. 3,000 posterior samples were
used for each Ri,6 so that S = 3, 000. Note that the use of more posterior samples may lead
to better prediction results. However, the computation cost is linearly proportional to the
number of posterior samples. Consequently, it might not be desirable to extract excessively
many posterior samples to accomplish marginal improvement in prediction.

• True: premium that uses the true value of Ri,6 that have been used for generating Yi,6 so
that ˆµi,6 = Ri,6ˆλi,6. Note that true premium is only available with simulation studies and
contains no model error on the unobserved heterogeneity component.

We compare the actual claim frequency in the out-of-sample validation set with the predicted
claim frequency using the premium calculation methods for each policyholder. Prediction perfor-
mances are measured by mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), which
quantify discrepancies between the actual and predicted values using L1 and L2 norms, respec-
tively. To incorporate the inherent randomness of the Poisson random variable Yi,6, we generate
100 copies of Yi,6 with the ﬁxed mean Ri,6λi,6 and compute both RMSE and MAE. In Table 3,
notably, both the naive and static premiums cannot capture the time-decaying eﬀects of dynamic
random eﬀects and have relatively poorer performances when ρ = 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9. While the exact
premium tends to have better prediction performance, such performance of the exact premium is
at the expense of substantial calculation time in this particular example17 as shown in Table 4.
Conversely, the use of the proposed premium is acceptable throughout diverse scenarios of serial
dependence, while the computation cost is modest compared to the exact method via MCMC. In
this regard, our proposed method can be considered as a reasonable and applicable approximation
of the true premium in practice in various scenarios.

16We note that the analytical expression of the exact premium in (1) under the setting in this subsection is not

possible. Alternatively, the exact premium in (1) can be obtained by MCMC simulations.

17All the premiums were calculated using a laptop with Intel Core i7-8565K at 1.80Ghz 4 cores, 16GB memory.

5. Actuarial application: ratemaking with longitudinal data

For a real data analysis, we use a sample of claim dataset from the Local Government Property
Insurance Fund (LGPIF), operated by the state of Wisconsin. Although this dataset is considerably
rich and contains information on multiple lines of insurance coverage, here, we only focus on the
posterior ratemaking of inland marine (IM) claims with our proposed state-space model. This
sample contains 6,338 observations of claims and policy characteristics over years 2006–2011 with
1,098 policyholders. Observations over the years 2006–2010 are used as the training set, while
observations over the year 2011 are set aside for out-of-sample validation. Table 5 provides brief
summary statistics of policy characteristics. There are seven categorical explanatory variables
related with location and two continuous covariates. We direct interested readers to refer to Frees

17

et al. (2016) for a more detailed preliminary analysis of the dataset.

To compute credibility factors in the proposed model, we need to determine the values of ρ
and γ. We can also consistently estimate dispersion parameters of the state-space model, ρ and γ,
using the method of moments—a similar approach to page 13 of Sutradhar and Jowaheer (2003).
It turns out that ˆρ = 0.8831 and ˆγ = 0.8360.

Once ˆβ, ˆρ, and ˆγ are determined, one can compute credibility factors for the proposed model
based on (6) and (7). We expect that (cid:98)α1 ≤ · · · ≤ (cid:98)α5 from Remark 2. Figure 1 visualizes contribu-
tions to credibility factors, ((cid:98)α1/λT +1, . . . , (cid:98)αT /λT +1), along with the ages of past claims that also
show clearly increasing patterns of credibility factors as well as the nonnegativity of the credibility
factors.

Figure 2 explains the behaviors of posterior rating factors depending on the number of past
claims observed. First, those who had no claim at all in the past years would get sure discounts,
which is considerably reasonable and agree with (29) as Yt − λt < 0 for all t = 1, . . . , T in this
case. One can also see that posterior rating factors tend to increase as a function of the numbers of
past claims on average, which gives a motivation of risk mitigation and control to the policyholders
for possible future discount. Further, interestingly, it is still possible to get discount even with a
positive number of past claims as Yt −λt is not necessarily positive, especially when λt is suﬃciently
large. Therefore, the given posterior ratemaking scheme still penalizes those who had claims in the
past but in a relative manner and considering adjustments with varying levels of expected claims
determined by observable characteristics.

In this sample study, the proposed dynamic credibility premium outperforms both the naive
and static credibility premiums as shown in Table 7. This is in terms of both RMSE and MAE and
even as good as the exact premium, which is obtained by 30,000 posterior sampling of the posterior

6. Concluding remarks

In this study, we have examined the existence or the lack thereof of decreasing properties for the
credibility coeﬃcients in dynamic random eﬀect models. We have shown that this is the case when
the dynamic random eﬀect process has an AR(1) type ACF and have found counter-examples when
the ACF assumes some of the more general forms. Hence, for these models, credibility premium
can be safely used, if the reader is unwilling to specify completely the dynamics of the random
eﬀect process for computational or robustness concerns. However, because the AR(1)-type ACF
is a quite restrictive speciﬁcation, the take-home message we want to convey is not necessarily to
stick with AR(1)-type dynamic credibility models. Rather, we also want to bring this potential

18In this small sample study, the proposed dynamic credibility premium ourperforms the exact premium in the test

sample.

important open question is whether we can suitably extend the class of “admissible” ACF’s beyond
the AR(1) case. Indeed, in the two counter-examples that we found, the dynamic random eﬀect
process has an unconstrained ACF, or is non-ergodic. In other words, we have not ruled out the
possibility that other ergodic processes with non-AR(1) ACF could be compatible with decreasing
credibility coeﬃcients. For instance, some interesting candidate ACF’s to investigate would be
those of ARFIMA(0,d,0)-type, which have recently been proved by Pinquet (2020b) to ensure at
least the positivity of the credibilities. This is left for future research.

Appendix A. Proof of Theorem 1

For expository purpose, let us ﬁrst introduce some further notations. Deﬁne T × T diagonal

matrices

ΛT = diag (λ1, · · · , λT )

and ΞT = diag (ξ1, · · · , ξT ) ,

where

Cov [Yt1, Yt2] ,
Var (Yt1) ,

t1 (cid:54)= t2;
t1 = t2;

for t1, t2 = 1, · · · , T . Further, we deﬁne the following symbols, which are convenient to express the
result on credibility premium for Model 1.

Deﬁnition 1. For the given ξ1, . . . , ξT > 0 and ρ ∈ (−1, 1), deﬁne the sequences (v1, . . . , vT ) and
(u1, . . . , uT ) as follows.

i. Deﬁne dT := 1 + ξT and iteratively deﬁne

dt := 1 + ρ2 + ξt −

for

t = T − 1, . . . , 2.

Finally, deﬁne

ii. Deﬁne v1 = 1/d1 and iteratively deﬁne

vt :=

ρ

for

t = 2, . . . , T.

iii. Deﬁne δ1 := 1 + ξ1 and iteratively deﬁne

δt := 1 + ρ2 + ξt −

ρ2

,

for

t = 2, . . . , T − 1.

Finally, deﬁne

uT =

and iteratively deﬁne

ut :=

for

t = T − 1, . . . , 1.

Simple calculation shows that dt > 0 for t = 2, . . . , T − 1 so that the sequences (v1, . . . , vT ) and
(u1, . . . , uT ) in Deﬁnition 1 are well-deﬁned. The following lemma provides some more results on
the sequences (v1, . . . , vT ) and (u1, . . . , uT ).

Lemma 1. For the given ξ1, . . . , ξt > 0 and ρ ∈ (−1, 1), we have the following results on the
sequences (v1, . . . , vT ) and (u1, . . . , uT ) in Deﬁnition 1.

i. (v1:T ) is a decreasing sequence—vt ≥ vt+1 for t = 1, . . . , T − 1 where the equality holds for

ρ = 0.

ii. (u1:T ) is an increasing sequence—ut ≤ ut+1 for t = 1, . . . , T − 1 where the equality holds for

ρ = 0.

Proof. To prove part i, it suﬃces to show that ρ/dt ≤ 1 for t = 2, . . . , T by induction. First, one
can easily see that ρ/dT = ρ/(1 + ξT ) ≤ 1. Further, if ρ/dk+1 ≤ 1, then

dk − ρ = 1 + ρ2 − ρ + ξk −

ρ2
dk+1

= (1 − ρ)2 + ξk + ρ

ρ

≥ 0,

which lead to dt ≥ ρ for t = 2, . . . , T − 1 and subsequently ρ/dt ≤ 1 for t = 2, . . . , T − 1.
For part ii, one can prove that ρ/δt ≤ 1 for t = 1, . . . , T − 1 in the same manner.

We also provide new symbols and related properties that are useful in the calculation of credi-

bility factors.
Deﬁnition 2. Under the distributional assumption in Model 1, deﬁne a T × T diagonal matrix Q∗
T
by

Q∗
t := ψE [V (λtRt)]. We further deﬁne a T × T matrix Σ∗

Proof. The proof of (A.2) is from the well-known result on the inverse of AR(1) matrix ΣT,ρ. The
result in (A.3) is the immediate result of (A.2). The proof of part ii is from (A.1) and the simple
matrix algebra.

Finally, we present the analytical expression for the credibility premium under the distributional

assumption in Model 1.

Theorem 2. Consider a state-space model comprising a state process (Rt
: t = 0, 1, . . .) and
observable time series (Yt : t = 1, 2, . . .) in Model 1. Subsequently, the credibility premium deﬁned
in (19) has the following property.

ii. The credibility premium deﬁned in (19) is regular.

Proof. For convenience, we ﬁrst show the representation for ((cid:98)α1, · · · , (cid:98)αT ). Subsequently, we can
use the equation in (20). Following the classical procedure in B¨uhlmann and Gisler (2006), we have

((cid:98)α1, · · · , (cid:98)αT )(cid:48) = (ΣT )−1 (Cov [Y1, YT +1] , · · · , Cov [YT , YT +1])(cid:48)

where the third equality is from Woodbury matrix identity (Hager, 1989; Higham, 2002), the fourth
equality is from Lemma 2, and the ﬁnal equality is from (A.5). Now, (20) concludes the proof of
part i, and part ii immediately comes from part i.

Finally, the proof of Theorem 1 follows immediately from Theorem 2.

Appendix B. A heterogeneous INAR(1) model

Here, we investigate the ordering of credibility factors in the heterogeneous integer-valued au-
toregressive (INAR(1)) model proposed in Gourieroux and Jasiak (2004). Owing to its simple and
intuitive structure, INAR(1) model is widely used in the modelling of the frequency in insurance
literature (Boucher et al., 2008).

For a non-negative integer-valued random variable Y and the constant p ∈ [0, 1], deﬁne the
thinning operator p ◦ Y as follows: conditional on Y , p ◦ Y is a random variable distributed by
BN (Y, p)—the binomial distribution with size Y and probability p.

Deﬁnition 3 (baseline or homogenous INAR(1) model). Consider an autoregressive count model
(Yt; t = 1, 2, · · · ) such that Y1 ∼ Pois( λ
1−p ), and for all t > 1,

Yt = p ◦ Yt−1 + (cid:15)t

(B.1)

26

where (cid:15)t’s are i.i.d. observations drawn from Pois(λ). Furthermore, conditionally on Yt−1, the
random variable p ◦ Yt−1 is assumed to be independent from the sequence (cid:15)t. It has been shown by
(McKenzie, 1985; Al-Osh and Alzaid, 1987) that this process is stationary and has AR(1)-like ACF
as, by deﬁnition, E[Yt|Yt−1] = pYt−1 + λ.

Deﬁnition 4 (Heterogeneous INAR(1) model). The heterogeneous INAR(1) model extends the
above baseline INAR(1) model by allowing the parameter λ to be heterogeneous across the popula-
tion. More precisely, we say that (Yt; t = 1, 2, · · · ) is heterogeneous INAR(1), if

i.) given the unobservable heterogeneity factor R, the sequence (Yt; t = 1, 2, · · · ) follows the INAR(1)
process in (B.1), where conditional on the past observation Yt−1, Yt−2, · · · , Y1, variables p◦Yt−1
and (cid:15)t are independent with distributions BN (Yt−1, p) and Pois (λR), respectively.

ii.) The marginal distribution of R is Gamma (1, ψ0).

For the heterogeneous IN AR(1) in Model 1, as E [R] = 1, we still have

E [Yt] =

λ
1 − p

.

Moreover,

Cov [Yt, Yt+h] =

(B.2)

Consequently, it satisﬁes the positive covariance ordering in (2). However, from Lemma 3 below,
we have the ordering of credibility factors in (13) showing that the credibility factors do not satisfy
the increasing property in (10).

Lemma 3. Under the heterogeneous INAR(1) model in Deﬁnition 4, the credibility premium in

Furthermore, by Sherman–Morrison formula (Sherman and Morrison, 1950; Press et al., 2007),
observe the following matrix calculation

Subsequently, by (3), (B.5), and (B.6), the credibility premium in (4) is obtained as in (B.3) and

Appendix C. Results on the ordering of the credibility factors under speciﬁc variance

functions

Corollary 1. Consider the time series (Yt) in the state-space model in Model 1. Subsequently, we
have the following results regardless of the choice of (λt).

i. If we are given the following variance function

of the EDF in (14), then the credibility factors satisfy

V (x) = x

(cid:98)α1 ≤ · · · ≤ (cid:98)αT ,

where the equality holds if and only if ρ = 0.
ii. If we are given the following variance function

V (x) = x2

of the EDF in (14), then the credibility factors corresponding to the standardized observations
satisfy

where the equality holds if and only if ρ = 0.

The unit variance functions of Poisson and gamma distributions are given by V (µ) = µ and
V (µ) = µ2, respectively. The following examples show that the numerical experiments on the
ordering of the credibility factors conﬁrm the results in Corollary 1.

Example 10. In this example, under the settings in Example 7, we calculate the credibility factors
of the non-standard observations, (Y1, · · · , YT ) with same parameters in Section 4.1. We note that
the unit variance function of the Poisson distribution is given by the identity function. Conse-
quently, Corollary 1 implies that the credibility factors of non-standard observations (Y1, · · · , YT )
are increasing regardless of the choice of (λt) as shown in Table C.8.

Example 11. In this example, under the settings in Example 6, we calculate the credibility fac-
tors of the non-standard observations (Y1, · · · , YT ) and the standard observations (Y ∗
T ),
respectively, with T = 5, σ2 = 0.5, and ψ = 0.5.

1 , · · · , Y ∗

As the unit distribution function of the Gamma distribution is given by V (µ) = µ2, Corollary
1 implies that the credibility factors of non-standard observations (Y ∗
T ) are increasing re-
gardless of the choice of (λt). Note that the credibility factors of standard observations are not
necessarily increasing as shown in Table C.9.
