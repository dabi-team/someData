In the study of complex physical and biological systems represented by multivariate stochastic
processes, an issue of great relevance is the description of the system dynamics spanning multiple
temporal scales. While methods to assess the dynamic complexity of individual processes at diﬀerent
time scales are well-established, multiscale analysis of directed interactions has never been formal-
ized theoretically, and empirical evaluations are complicated by practical issues such as ﬁltering and
downsampling. Here we extend the very popular measure of Granger causality (GC), a prominent
tool for assessing directed lagged interactions between joint processes, to quantify information trans-
fer across multiple time scales. We show that the multiscale processing of a vector autoregressive
(AR) process introduces a moving average (MA) component, and describe how to represent the
resulting ARMA process using state space (SS) models and to combine the SS model parameters for
computing exact GC values at arbitrarily large time scales. We exploit the theoretical formulation
to identify peculiar features of multiscale GC in basic AR processes, and demonstrate with numer-
ical simulations the much larger estimation accuracy of the SS approach compared with pure AR
modeling of ﬁltered and downsampled data. The improved computational reliability is exploited
to disclose meaningful multiscale patterns of information transfer between global temperature and
carbon dioxide concentration time series, both in paleoclimate and in recent years.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Granger causality (GC) is a powerful tool for assess-
ing directional interactions from time series data accord-
ing to the notion of time lagged inﬂuence ﬁrst proposed
by Wiener [1] and then formalized by Granger [2] and
Geweke [3, 4] in the framework of vector autoregres-
sive (AR) modeling of stochastic processes. Since its
formulation, GC has gained increasing popularity and
is nowadays ubiquitously employed in several scientiﬁc
ﬁelds ranging from econometrics to social and climate sci-
ences, neuroscience and physiology [5–8]. The great suc-
cess of this measure comes from its conceptual simplicity,
data-driven nature, and relative ease of implementation.
An additional appealing property of GC is the principled
interpretation of its generalized probabilistic formulation,
which is closely related to the the information-theoretic
concept of transfer entropy [9].

Many processes in physics, biology and other ﬁelds ex-
hibit dynamics spanning multiple temporal scales [10–
14]. The multiscale properties of an observed stochas-
tic process can be explored ﬁrst resampling at diﬀerent
temporal scales the originally measured realization of the
process, and then assessing the dynamical complexity of
the rescaled series [15]. This approach has been followed
with great success to quantify the multiscale behavior
of the individual dynamics of scalar processes [11–14].

However, its extension to the multiscale computation of
the information transfer between processes, though at-
tempted in empirical studies [16, 17], is far less straight-
forward. In fact, the multiscale evaluation of lagged inﬂu-
ence measures such as the GC is severely complicated by
theoretical and practical issues [18, 19]. These issues arise
from the rescaling procedure, which essentially consists in
a ﬁltering step eliminating the fast temporal scales (clas-
sically performed by averaging [15]) followed by a down-
sampling step that coarse-grains the time series around
the selected scale. The ﬁltering step leaves theoretically
unchanged the GC values, but degrades severely their es-
timation aﬀecting reliability, stability and data demand
[20]. The downsampling step is even more problematic,
as it alters GC values in a way that was unknown until
very recently [18, 19] and impacts consistently detectabil-
ity and accuracy of GC estimates. For these reasons,
research on the data-driven inference of the multiscale
structure of coupled processes, though holding a great
potential, is still largely undeveloped.

In order to provide a formal extension of GC to multi-
scale analysis, here we introduce for the ﬁrst time an an-
alytical frame for its computation on linear multivariate
stochastic processes subjected to averaging and down-
sampling. We exploit the theory of state space (SS)
models [18, 19, 21] to yield exact GC values for for cou-
pled processes observed at diﬀerent time scales. The high

 
 
 
 
 
 
computational reliability of the associated multiscale GC
estimator is demonstrated in simulated AR processes and
then used to explore, spanning a wide range of time
scales, the patterns of information transfer between an-
thropogenic emissions and global temperatures.

II. GRANGER CAUSALITY

A. Deﬁnition

To lay the groundwork for multiscale GC computa-
tion and introduce notations, we start resuming the cal-
culation of GC for general multivariate processes [2, 4].
Let us consider a discrete-time, stationary vector stochas-
tic process composed of M real-valued zero-mean scalar
processes, Yn = [y1,n · · · yM,n]T , −∞ < n < ∞, and
assume the process yj as the target and the process yi
as the driver (the remaining M − 2 processes form the
vector Yk, where k = {1, . . . , M }\{i, j}). Then, denot-
ing the present and the past of vector and scalar vari-
ables respectively as Yn, yn, and Y −
n−2 · · · ],
y−
n = [yn−1yn−2 · · · ], GC from yi to yj (conditional on
Yk) quantiﬁes the extent to which y−
i,n improves the pre-
diction of yj,n above and beyond the extent to which
yj,n is predicted by y−
j,n and Y −
k,n. This deﬁnition is as-
sessed in the time domain performing a regression of the
present of the target on the past of all processes, yield-
ing the prediction error ej|ijk,n = yj,n − E[yj,n|Y −
n ], and
on the past of all processes except the driver, yielding
the prediction error ej|jk,n = yj,n − E[yj,n|y−
k,n] (E is
the expectation operator). The prediction error variances
resulting from these ”full” and ”restricted” regressions,
λj|ijk = E[e2
j|ijk,n] and λj|jk = E[e2
j|jk,n] are then com-
bined to yield GC from yi to yj as [4]

n = [Y T

j,n, Y −

n−1Y T

Fi→j = ln

λj|jk
λj|ijk

.

j,n, Y −

The measure (1) is the log-likelihood ratio for the two lin-
ear regressions associated with the projections E[yj,n|Y −
n ]
and E[yj,n|y−
k,n] [18]. According to the axiomatic
deﬁnition of transfer entropy and its equivalence (up to
a factor 2) to Eq.(1) for Gaussian variables [9], the GC
can be interpreted as the rate of ”information transfer”
from driver to target.

B. State-Space Formulation

Following the derivations of a recent work by Barnett
et al. [18], now we move to describe the computation of
GC for state state space (SS) processes. The very well
known linear SS representation of an observed multivari-
ate process Y is given by [22]

2

where X is the state (unobserved) process, and W and
V are zero-mean white noise processes with covariances
n ] and Ψ≡E[VnV T
Ξ≡E[WnW T
n ], and cross-covariance
Θ≡E[WnV T
n ].

The SS process has an equivalent representation, re-
ferred to as ”innovations form” SS (ISS), evidencing the
innovations En = Yn − E[Yn|Y −
n ], i.e., the residuals of
the linear regression of Yn on its inﬁnite past Y −
n , whose
covariance matrix is Φ≡E[EnET
n ]. The ISS representa-
tion, which is typically associated with Kalman ﬁltering,
is characterized by the state process Zn = E[Xn|Y −
n ] and
by the Kalman Gain matrix K:

Zn+1 = AZn + KEn
Yn = CZn + En.

(3a)
(3b)

(4)

The SS and ISS representations share the state and ob-
servation matrices A and C, and diﬀer in the noise ma-
trices (Ξ, Ψ, Θ) and (K, Φ). To ﬁnd the ISS parameters
(A, C, K, Φ) from the SS parameters (A, C, Ξ, Ψ, Θ) it
is necessary to solve a so-called discrete algebraic Ricatti
equation (DARE ), formulated in terms of the state error
variance matrix P:
P = APAT + Ξ

− (APCT + Θ)(CPCT + Ψ)−1(CPAT + ΘT ),

from which K and Φ are obtained as

Φ = CPCT + Ψ
K = (APCT + Θ)Φ−1.

(5)

n

Then, GC can be computed from the ISS parameters
as follows [18]. The error variance of the full regression
is simply the j − th diagonal element of the innovation
covariance, λj|ijk = Φ(j, j). The error of the restricted
regression is obtained by forming a submodel that ex-
cludes the driver process, i.e. considering a state space
model with state equation (3a) and observation equation
n = C(jk)Zn + E(jk)
Y (jk)
(6)
where the superscript (a) denotes selection of the rows
with indices a of a matrix. Of note, this technique rep-
resents one of the key elements in the derivation of a
rigorous formalism for deﬁning the information ﬂow be-
tween the states of both discrete stochastic mappings and
continuous time stochastic systems [23]. Here, we have
that the submodel (3a, 6) is an SS model with param-
eters (A, C(jk), KΦKT , Φ(jk, jk), KΦ(:, jk)), which can
be converted to an ISS model with innovation covariance
ΦR solving the DARE (4,5), so that the restricted error
variance becomes λj|jk = ΦR(j, j). This shows that GC
can be computed numerically from the ISS parameters
(A, C, K, Φ) of an observed process Y .

III. MULTISCALE GRANGER CAUSALITY

Xn+1 = AXn + Wn
Yn = CXn + Vn

(2a)
(2b)

In this Section we develop our framework for the mul-
tiscale computation of GC for linear multivariate pro-
cesses. Here we consider the most common operalization

of GC, i.e. that grounded on the AR representation of
multivariate processes [2, 7–9]:

Yn =

p
(cid:88)

k=1

AkYn−k + Un,

(7)

where p is the model order, Ak are M ×M matrices of co-
eﬃcients, and Un = [u1,n · · · uM,n]T is a vector of M zero
mean Gaussian innovation processes with covariance ma-
trix Σ≡E[UnU T
n ]. To study the observed process Y at the
temporal scale identiﬁed by the scale factor τ , we apply
to each constituent process ym, m = 1, . . . , M ,the follow-
ing transformation which performs a weighted average of
q consecutive samples of the process:

¯ym,n =

q
(cid:88)

l=0

blym,nτ −l.

(8)

This rescaling operation corresponds to transform the
original process Y through a two-step procedure that
consists of the following ﬁltering and downsampling
steps, performed respectively with a ﬁlter of order q and
a rate of downsampling equal to τ . The ﬁltering and
downsampling steps yield respectively the processes ˜Y
and ¯Y deﬁned as:

˜Yn =

q
(cid:88)

l=0

blYn−l,

¯Yn = ˜Ynτ , n = 1, . . . , N/τ.

(9a)

(9b)

The change of scale in (8) generalizes the averaging pro-
cedure originally proposed in [15], which sets q = τ − 1
and bl = 1/τ . In this study we identify the bl as the coef-
ﬁcients of a linear lowpass ﬁlter with cutoﬀ frequency set
at fτ = 1/2τ to avoid aliasing in the subsequent down-
sampling step. Here, we develop a FIR ﬁlter of order q
using the window method and implementing a Hamming
window [24]. The design of a causal ﬁlter which performs
one-side ﬁltering was chosen on purpose to avoid that
past and future samples mix up in the ﬁltering process
with potentially harmful consequences on the evaluation
of causality. The use of one-side ﬁltering is in agreement
with the adoption of a Euler forward scheme, rather than
a central diﬀerencing scheme, in the deﬁnition of causal
measures of information ﬂow (see, e.g., [25, 26]). More-
over, the use of a FIR ﬁlter achieves better elimination
of the fast temporal scales with respect to the averaging
procedure commonly adopted in multiscale complexity
analysis [15]; in our preliminary work [27] we have shown
indeed that the use of simple averaging may induce the
detection of spurious causal inﬂuences over uncoupled di-
rections.

Substituting (7) in (9a), the ﬁltering step leads to the

process representation:

3

where Bl = blIM (IM is the M × M identity matrix).
Hence, the change of scale introduces a moving average
(MA) component of order q in the original AR(p) process,
transforming it into an ARMA(p, q) process. Then, ex-
ploiting the close relation between ARMA and SS models
[21], the process (10) is turned into an ISS model by deﬁn-
ing the state process ˜Zn = [Y T
n−q]T
that, together with ˜Yn, obeys the state equations (3) with
parameters ( ˜A, ˜C, ˜K, ˜Φ), where

tions ˜En = B0Un. Moreover, the downsampled process
¯Yn can be put in ISS form directly from the ISS formula-
tion of the ﬁltered process ˜Yn: exploiting a recent result
(theorem III in [19]), we ﬁnd that ¯Yn = ˜Ynτ has an ISS
representation with state process ¯Zn = ˜Znτ , innovation
process ¯En = ˜Enτ , and parameters ( ¯A, ¯C, ¯K, ¯Φ), where
¯A = ˜Aτ , ¯C = ˜C, and where ¯K and ¯Φ are obtained solv-
ing the DARE (4,5) for the SS model ( ¯A, ¯C, Ξτ , ˜Φ, Θτ )
with

Θτ = ˜Aτ −1 ˜K ˜Φ
Ξτ = ˜AΞτ −1 ˜AT + ˜K ˜Φ ˜KT , τ ≥ 2
Ξ1 = ˜K ˜Φ ˜KT , τ = 1.

each step, an innovation state space (ISS) model can be de-
ﬁned which describes the multivariate process; then ISS sub-
models can be formed and, after solving a discrete algebraic
Ricatti Equation (DARE), GC can be computed for any scale
factor τ ≥ 1 (τ = 1 yields GC for the non-rescaled processes).

The overall procedure for multiscale analysis is de-
picted in Fig. 1: ﬁltering with cutoﬀ fτ the AR(p) pro-
cess Y yields an ARMA(p, q) process, which is equivalent

to an ISS process; the subsequent downsampling yields
a diﬀerent SS process, which in turn can be converted
to the ISS form solving the DARE. Thus, both ﬁltered
and downsampled processes are described by ISS models,
whose parameters can be used to compute GC by form-
ing a submodel in which the target is observed without
considering the driver process (eq. (6)) and solving the
DARE for this submodel. This procedure allows analyt-
ical computation of GC measures for multiscale (ﬁltered
and downsampled) processes, which is illustrated in the
following for simulated and real time series.

IV. SIMULATION STUDY

A. VAR process with time delayed causal
interactions

Theoretical analysis and simulations are ﬁrst per-

formed for the bivariate AR process with equations:

y1,n = c11y1,n−d11 + c12y2,n−d12 + u1,n
y2,n = c22y2,n−d22 + c21y1,n−d21 + u2,n

(12a)
(12b)

with iid noise processes u1,n, u2,n ∼ N (0, 1). The pa-
rameters in (12) are set to generate autonomous dynam-
ics with strength cii and lag dii for each scalar process
yi, and causal interactions with strength cij and lag dij
from yj to yi (i, j = 1, 2). We consider two parameter
conﬁgurations: unidirectional interaction at lag 2 from
y1 to y2, obtained setting c12 = 0 and c21 = 0.5, d21 = 2,
where also autonomous dynamics are generated for y1
but not for y2 (c11 = 0.5, d11 = 1, c22 = 0); bidi-
rectional interactions with diﬀerent lags and strengths
(c12 = 0.75, d12 = 2; c21 = 0.5, d21 = 7) in the presence
of autonomous dynamics for both processes (c11 = c22 =
0.5, d11 = d22 = 1). First, we study the exact values of
multiscale GC obtained from the true AR parameters.
The theoretical trends depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 (black
solid lines) document from the perspective of SS model-
ing the invariance of GC under ﬁltering, already proven
in [20]. The behavior of the information transfer across
multiple temporal scales is thus shaped by the downsam-
pling step, revealing the tendency of GC to peak at scales
corresponding with the lag of the imposed causal inter-
actions: maximal information transfer is found at τ = 2
for F1→2 in the unidirectional scheme (Fig. 3a,b), and
at τ = 7 for F1→2 and τ = 2 for F2→1 in the bidirec-
tional scheme (Fig. 3c). The behavior is general, in the
sense that it was observed also for diﬀerent parameter
conﬁgurations.

Next, we test reliability of multiscale GC estimates
obtained from ﬁnite length realizations of (12) (a) fol-
lowing a na¨ıve approach whereby GC is computed per-
forming full and restricted regressions on the ﬁltered and
downsampled time series, and (b) performing AR identi-
ﬁcation on the original time series and then applying the
new proposed framework to the estimated AR parame-

the theoretical values (black lines) and distribution of esti-
mates (median: white lines; interquartile range: grey areas)
of GC computed as a function of the time scale after ﬁltering
(FLT) and downsampling (DWS). Estimates are obtained us-
ing the na¨ıve AR approach (a) and the proposed framework
implemented using a lowpass FIR ﬁlter of order q = 6 (b).

ters [28]. Application of the two approaches to 100 pro-
cess realizations of 500 points is depicted in Figs. 2a, 3a
and in Figs. 2b, 3b respectively, and indicates the need
of state-space analysis: while the computation of GC af-
ter ﬁltering and downsampling returns strongly biased
and highly variable estimates, the new framework yields
accurate detection of GC across multiple scales.

B. VAR process with multiscale causal interactions

As a second simulation example, we consider the
case of coupled stochastic processes displaying multi-
scale structure and scale-dependent causal interactions.
Speciﬁcally, we consider the bivariate process Yn =
[y1,ny2,n]T obtained as the instantaneous mixing of pairs
of scalar processes taken from the two bivariate AR pro-

cesses Xn = [x1,nx2,n]T and Zn = [z1,nz2,n]T :

x1,n = 1.9x1,n−1 − 0.9025x1,n−2 + u1,n
x2,n = 0.5x1,n−1 + u2,n,
z1,n = 1.6929z1,n−1 − 0.9025z1,n−2 + w1,n
z2,n = z1,n−1 + w2,n,
y1,n = x1,n + z2,n
y2,n = x2,n + z1,n.

(13a)
(13b)
(13c)
(13d)
(13e)
(13f)

In the bivariate processes X and Z, autonomous dynam-
ics are set for the subprocesses x1 and z1 according to
Eqs. (13a, 13c); the autonomous rhythms are obtained
by placing a pole with modulus ρx1 = ρz1 = 0.95 in the
complex plane representation of each individual subpro-
cess, and the phase of the poles is varied to obtain slow
oscillations for x1 (φx1 = 0) and faster oscillations for z1
(φz1 = 0.47). Moreover, causal interactions are imposed
from x1 to x2 and from z1 to z2 according to Eqs. (13b,
13d); in this study, the variances of the uncorrelated in-
novations are set to λu1 = 0.25, λu2 = 0.5, for the process
U , and to λw1 = 1, λw2 = 0.5, for the process W . Then,
the mixing obtained with Eqs. (13e, 13f) is such that
the bivariate process Y exhibits causal interactions from
y2 to y1 visible at small time scales for the faster oscilla-
tions, as well as causal interactions from y1 to y2 visible
at larger time scales for the slower oscillations.

To test the ability of our framework to detect these
multiscale behaviors, we performed VAR identiﬁcation
on realizations of 1000 data points of the observed pro-
cess Y and then computed the GC for temporal scales
ranging from 1 to 15; the model order was optimized us-
ing the BIC criterion, and the order of the lowpass FIR
ﬁlter was set to q = 6. The results of the analysis are
reported in Fig. 4. The exemplary realizations shown
in Fig. 4(a) display multiscale patterns characterized by
a slow rhythm (cycle of ∼ 70 points) superimposed to
faster oscillations (cycle of ∼ 13 points); the multiscale
GC analysis reveals that the direction of interaction is
from y2 to y1 for the fast oscillations (Fy2→y1 is maxi-
mum at low time scales), and from y1 to y2 for the slower
rhythm (Fy1→y2 emerges at higher time scales when fast
oscillations are ﬁltered out). These results are conﬁrmed
by the analysis extended to several process realizations
reported in Fig. 4(b), which indicates that GC peaks at
scale τ = 2 along the direction y2 → y1, and at scales
τ = 4 and τ = 8 along the direction y1 → y2, thus
detecting the multiscale patterns of bidirectional inter-
action imposed in the simulation.

V. PRACTICAL APPLICATION

As a practical application, we consider the multiscale
analysis of GC between carbon dioxide concentration
(CO2) and global temperature (GT ). It is widely con-
sidered that the raise of CO2 is a main cause of global
warming [29], although the validity of such causal relation

deﬁned as in Eq. (13). Plots depict two exemplary realiza-
tions of the observed process Yn = [y1,ny2,n] together with
the GC computed as a function of the time scale τ along the
two directions of interaction (a) and the distribution of esti-
mates (median: solid lines; interquartile range: shaded areas)
obtained over 100 realizations of the process (b).

is still under debate. The problem of understanding the
causes of climate change is usually tackled by numerical
experiments using Global Climate Models [30] which aim
at catching the complexity of climate dynamics. How-
ever, data-driven approaches, as GC, are also fruitful in
assessing cause-eﬀect relationships between temperature
and external forcings. In [31] it has been shown that CO2
Granger causes temperature, based on data from 1860 to
2008, partly from ice cores, and analyzing second diﬀer-
ences of both CO2 and GT . Similar conclusions were
found in [32], using GC, in [33] by estimating the time
rate of information ﬂowing from one time series to the
other, and in [6] using a physical approach.

Here, we ﬁrst analyze the global land-ocean tempera-
ture index [34] and CO2 concentration [35] measured at
monthly resolution from March 1958 to February 2017.
The measured time series, lasting 708 data points, are
shown in Fig. 5(a). To fulﬁll stationarity criteria, we de-
trended the two series applying an L1 norm ﬁlter. The
analyzed time series, normalized to zero mean and unit
variance, are shown in Fig. 5(b). We applied the pro-
posed framework to compute GC along the two directions
of interaction for time scales ranging from 1 to 100 years.
To test the statistical signiﬁcance of the estimated mul-
tiscale patterns of causality, the analysis was performed
both for the original time series and for a set of 100 pairs
of uncoupled time series sharing the autocorrelation and
amplitude distribution of the original series; these surro-
gate series are generated using the iterative amplitude-
adjusted Fourier transform (IAAFT) algorithm [36].

6

The results depicted in Fig. 5(c) show that the GC
along both directions is not distinguishable from the cor-
responding surrogate counterparts at τ equal one year,
i.e. when standard GC analysis not encompassing mul-
tiple time scales is performed. On the other hand, the
multiscale approach reveals, at longer time scales (> 10
years), that GC is signiﬁcantly higher than the surro-
gate threshold along both directions of interaction, thus
showing the need of a multiscale approach to put in ev-
idence this mutual interdependency between CO2 and
GT . Moreover we remark that the GC along the direc-
tion CO2 → GT is characterized by a higher value of the
statistics computed on the original time series, but also
by higher values for the surrogate time series, compared
with the direction GT → CO2.

puted on the normalized time series (solid lines) and over

centiles: shaded areas). Computations are performed using
the proposed framework implemented with an order-6 FIR
lowpass ﬁlter. The AR model order, set by the BIC criterion,
is p = 3.

Fig. 6(a). Here, we studied the data resampled to an
uniform time spacing of 729.77 years, corresponding to
a time series length of 1095 points, and after normaliza-
tion to zero mean and unit variance (Fig. 6(b)); results of
multiscale GC analysis did not change substantially if the
original non-uniformly sampled time series were consid-
ered, or applying slightly diﬀerent uniform resampling.
In [38], empirical evidences for the existence of Granger
causal inﬂuences along both directions CO2 → GT and
GT → CO2 have been found after correcting for deter-
ministic trends on the same data. Here, applying our
framework for multiscale causality analysis we obtained
the GC curves reported in Fig. 6(c). We ﬁnd that, at pa-
leolithic time scales, the GC GT → CO2 is highly signiﬁ-
cant and peaks around 1000 and 10000 years. This result
may be related to the lags between Antarctic deglacial
warming and CO2 increase reported in [39], and also
conﬁrms the good evidences reported on the fact that
higher global temperatures do promote a rise of green-
house gas levels [40]. The opposite causal inﬂuence from
CO2 to GT is much less pronounced and exceeds the

the multiscale GC computed on the normalized time series
(solid lines) and over 100 IAAFT surrogates (median: white
lines; 5th −95th percentiles: shaded areas). Computations are
performed using the proposed framework implemented with
an order-6 FIR lowpass ﬁlter. The AR model order, set by
the BIC criterion, is p = 14.

Next, we dramatically change the time scales and turn
to consider paleoclimatological data, so as to analyze
the GC between GT and CO2 concentration on the Vos-
tok Ice Core data from 400,000 to 6,000 years ago, ex-
tended by the EPICA Dome C data which go back to
800,000 years ago [37]. The two time series, which are
sampled with non-uniform time spacing, are shown in

IAAFT threshold for statistical signiﬁcance only at very
small time scales.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

7

Summarizing, our results show that carbon dioxide and
temperature changes are interdependent at multiple time
scales, with a predominance of GT → CO2 eﬀects at pa-
leolithic scales, and the presence of bidirectional causal
interactions between GT and CO2 at the time scales of
modern climate. These results support the expectations
that changing temperatures could be held responsible for
changes in greenhouse gas concentrations on paleolithic
time scales, while during the last 60 years the eﬀect of
human activities becomes evident as anthropogenic radi-
active forcings are seemingly driving the global temper-
ature changes. These causal relationships between CO2
and global warming have been recently demonstrated in
[33]: in that work, the use of the rigorous formulation of
information ﬂow provided by [25] led to evidence a clear
unidirectional nature for the causal relation GT → CO2
in paleoclimatological data, and for the causal relation
CO2 → GT in modern climate data; in the same work,
the application of the standard GC index to modern cli-
mate data suggested the presence of bidirectional eﬀects
CO2 → GT and GT → CO2, thus pointing to some am-
biguity in the assessment of a predominant direction of
interaction using GC. Our results agree with this inter-
pretation, as we do not ﬁnd a prevalent causal direction
using the classical GC index computed at the smallest
time scale, and the use of surrogate data indicates the
lack of statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the
analysis performed at higher time scales reveals the ex-
istence of signiﬁcant GC CO2 → GT and, for the ﬁrst
time to our knowledge, a nontrivial GC GT → CO2 also
in modern climate. Although this result needs to be con-
ﬁrmed by the implementation of more robust measures of
information ﬂow, it may be of great relevance for climate
studies as it is indicative of a positive feedback which will
increase the eﬀect of anthropogenic emissions on global
temperatures.

The present study makes the ﬁrst step toward the the-
oretical understanding of multiscale causal relations be-
tween coupled stochastic processes, and opens the way
to the reliable estimation of these relations starting from
simple AR identiﬁcation. This will likely boost new im-
petus for research in the area of data-driven causality
analysis, both in physics and in a wide variety of applica-
tive ﬁelds. The proposed framework is ﬂexible enough to
encompass more general model representations that may
unveil important multiscale features of coupled processes.
For instance, integrating the standard AR representation
with fractional integrated (FI) innovation modeling [41]
would be straightforward as ARFI models have an SS
representation, and would easily lead to assess multiscale
GC in the presence of long-range correlations.

The proposed setting provides also the basis to expand
the applicability of multiscale GC to nonstationary and
nonlinear SS processes [42], and to formalize exact com-
putation of cross-scale information transfer within and
between multivariate processes [17], thus opening new
avenues of research in the evaluation of causal interac-
tions among coupled processes. Of particular interest in
this context is the recent formalization of the notion of
information ﬂow based on ﬁrst principles, rather than ax-
iomatic postulates or empirical proposals, implemented
in [23]. The latter work completes the rigorous formalism
introduced in [43, 44] and provides a well-principled al-
ternative to the operational implementation of GC, and
of transfer entropy intended as its non-parametric gen-
eralization, which are known to be complicated in many
practical settings to an extent that spurious causalities
may be revealed (e.g., in the presence of unobserved vari-
ables, measurement noise, or inappropriate time resolu-
tion) [45–48]. Hence, the availability of a rigorous deriva-
tion of the information ﬂowing among the components
of discrete time stochastic mapping, provided in [23] and
extended therein to continuous time stochastic mappings
and to deterministic systems, certainly constitutes a ﬁrm
basis for the design of a more faithful analysis of causality
between dynamical system components operated across
multiple temporal scales.
