Abstract. A 13.56 MHz RF discharge in hydrogen was studied within the pressure range of 1-

10  Pa,  and  at  power  range  of  400  -  1000  W.  The  electron  energy  distribution  function  and 

electron density were measured by a Langmuir probe. The gas temperature was determined by 

the Fulcher-α system in pure H2, and by the second positive system of nitrogen using N2 as the 

probing  gas.  The  gas  temperature  was  constant  and  equal  to  450  ±  50  K  in  the  Capacitively 

Coupled Plasma mode (CCP), and it was increasing with pressure and power in the Inductively 

Coupled  Plasma  mode  (ICP).  Also  the  vibrational  temperature  of  ground  state  of  hydrogen 

molecules  was  determined  to  be  around  3100  and  2000  ±  500  K  in  ICP  and  CCP  mode, 

respectively. The concentration of atomic hydrogen was determined by means of actinometry, 

either by using Ar (5 %) as the probing gas, or by using H2 as the actinometer in pure hydrogen 

(Q1 rotational line of Fulcher-α system) The concentration of hydrogen density was increasing 

with pressure in both modes, but with a dissociation degree slightly higher in the ICP mode (a 

factor 2).

1. Introduction

In  tokamaks  (nuclear  fusion  reactors),  a  hot  plasma  composed  of  deuterium  and  tritium  nuclei  is 

magnetically  confined  to  achieve  fusion  to  produce  energy.  The  ITER  tokamak  project  aims  to 

1 

demonstrate the feasibility of producing energy, while the DEMO reactor aims to be the first fusion 

reactor prototype to deliver power to the electric network. The present project is put into the context of 

these international projects. In tokamaks the core plasma is hot, about 1 – 10 keV, and the edge plasma 

is colder and has a temperature of few eV, depending on the tokamak. The edge plasma, despite being 

colder, strongly interacts with the walls of the machine. Particular parts of the walls, e.g. divertors, are 

subjected to high heat and particle fluxes leading to material erosion. Considering the case of erosion, 

divertors made of low atomic number (low-Z) material have, until now, been preferred due to the limit 

of energy loss by radiation. During recent years, graphite has been studied extensively, as material of 

which divertors would be composed, due to its invaluable thermal and mechanical properties (Mellet 

et  al  2014,  Pardanaud  et  al  2014,  Pardanaud  et  al  2013,  Pardanaud  et  al  2012,  Bernard  et  al  2013, 

Martin  et  al  2011,  Tsitrone  et  al  2011,  Pardanaud  et  al  2011,  Richou  et  al  2007).  However,  severe 

drawbacks  in  the  form  of  high  retention  of  tritium  (Pegourie  et  al  2013,  Roth  et  al  2009)  and  low 

resistance to neutron bombardment as well as erosion and co-deposition of hydrocarbons in shadowed 

area mean that graphite will never be used as a divertor material in fusion reactors. Therefore, current 

research  focus  is  put  on  high  Z  materials,  with  tungsten  being  considered  as  the  most  appropriate 

candidate. As it stands, both the German tokamak ASDEX upgrade (Hermann and Gruber 2003) and 

the European JET (EUROfusion 2014-2018), currently the most powerful tokamak in the world, are 

now  using  tungsten-coated  divertors.  Also  the  project  WEST  (Grosman  et  al  2013,  Marandet  et  al 

2014), aims to study and build a tungsten divertor in the tokamak Tore Supra at Cadarache. High-Z 

materials possess the advantage of having a high sputter threshold in hydrogen plasma, but at the cost 

of  radiating  a  huge  power  and  extinguishing  the  plasma  in  case  of  impurity  events.  To  prevent 

tungsten  erosion  in  fusion  reactor,  it  is  crucial  to  reduce  the  heat  load  on  divertors  to  less  than  10 

MWm-2 in steady state. Impurity gas seeding (N2, Ar, Ne…) is considered as the primary technique to 

decrease the heat load to the divertor. 

In  fusion  device,  plasma  facing  components  play  a  major  role  in  recycling  species.  The  edge 

plasma  physics  and  the  plasma-wall  interactions  are  important  bottlenecks  for  the  development  of 

fusion energy. Current edge codes used for the ITER design process, such as SOLEDGE2D-EIRENE 

(based on a fluid approach for the plasma and on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for neutral particles) 

(Ciraolo et al 2014), have only very limited ability to deal with mixed material environments (Toma et 

al 2010, Bonnin et al 2009), due to the lack of comprehensive wall model. These codes can to some 

extent  describe  impurity  migration  in  the  machine,  in  order  to  simulate  the  change  of  the  wall 

composition. But still, reliable data are not yet available for: thermal properties, sputtering yields and 

reflection coefficients for the resulting mixed materials. Among the data needed for simulation codes, 

atomic H reflection by a surface under plasma exposure is a key parameter playing a strong role on the 

process of hydrogen recycling at plasma wall (Brezinsek et al 2005, 2003). Under the detached plasma 

conditions  that  will  be  encountered  at  ITER  divertor,  ion  energy  is  below  20  eV.  The  TRIM  code 

(Eckstein 1991) which was used in the past to calculate atomic H reflection coefficients, is no longer 

2 

useful since it is based on the binary collision approximation which ceases to be valid below few tens 

of  eV.  More  recent  calculations  use  molecular  dynamic  (MD)  simulations  (Henriksson  et  al  2006, 

Inagaki et al 2011) instead of TRIM calculations to determine the reflection probability at low energy. 

As  MD  simulations  rely  on  a  calculated  interaction  potential,  results  obtained  must  always  be 

benchmarked with experiments. Finally, none of these calculations take into account impurity seeding. 

Therefore  we  have  developed  a  dedicated  laboratory  plasma  experiment  to  measure  hydrogen  (or 

deuterium)  reflection  coefficient  and  its  dependence  on  various  parameters  (impurities,  wall 

temperature, ion flux, atomic flux...).  

The present paper deals with the characterization of the above mentioned hydrogen plasma source, 

which is required before any measurement of the reflection coefficient. Let us note that this thematic 

of  atomic  loss  (or  atomic  reflection)  on  surface  is  not  only  limited  to  fusion  related  studies  but 

concerns  most  of  the  low-pressure  plasma  processes.  The  measurement  of  the  reflection  coefficient 

and  its  dependence  with  experimental  parameters  is  a  recurrent  issue  in  many  plasma  applications 

ranging from microelectronics to fusion, as evidenced by the high number of papers dealing with this 

subject over tens of years (Wood and Wise 1962, Cartry et al 2000, Rousseau et al 2001, Macko et al 

2004,  Lopaev  and  Smirnov  2004,  Mozetic  and  Cvelbar  2007,  Kurunczi  et  al  2005,  Rutigliano  and 

Cacciatore 2011, Jacq  et al 2013, Bousquet  et al 2007, Guerra 2007, Kang  et al 2011, Samuell and 

Corr  2014,  Sode  et  al  2014,  Marinov  et  al  2014  a).  Finally,  hydrogen  plasma  characterization  is  of 

interest not only because of the atomic surface loss issue, but also because hydrogen gas is often used 

for plasma processing such as hydrogenation (Hatano and Watanabe 2002), treatment of Si wafers for 

creating  subsurface  defects  in  layers  (Ghica  et  al  2010),  chemical  vapour  deposition  of  diamonds 

(Hassouni et al 1996), functional materials or polycrystalisation of amorphous Si, creation of positive 

(Liu  and  Fonash  1993,  Cielaszyk  et  al  1995)  or  negative-ions  in  ion-sources (Iordanova  et  al  2011, 

Kalache et al 2004, Ahmad et al 2010).  

In this work we characterize the RF plasma source in Capacitively Coupled (CCP) and Inductively 

Coupled  (ICP)  Plasma  modes  by  studying  primarily  a  pure  hydrogen  plasma.  We  determine  gas 

temperature  using  optical  emission  spectroscopy  under  nitrogen  admixture,  electron  density  and 

temperature  using  Langmuir  probe,  vibrational  temperature  of  ground  state  of  hydrogen  by  using 

Fulcher-α  emission  system,  and  atomic  hydrogen  concentration  using  actinometry  under  argon 

admixture.  All  measurements  were  realized  versus  pressure  (1  -  10  Pa)  and  delivered  power  (400  - 

1000 W) in continuous discharge or pulsed mode. The experimental apparatus is first described, and 

followed  by  the  description  and  discussion  in  particular  subsections  of  the  methods  and  the 

experimental results obtained. 

2. Experimental set-up and conditions of measurements

The scheme of the experimental set-up is given in figure 1. The plasma source consists of a spherical 

stainless chamber 300 mm in diameter. A planar coil antenna (three turn) is separated from the plasma 

3 

by a quartz window (166 mm in diameter,  12 mm thick) placed on top of the plasma chamber. The 

antenna  is  connected  to  an  L-type  matching  box  connected  to  Advanced  Energy  Cesar  1310  RF 

generator.  The  plasma  chamber  is  made  of  stainless  steel  with  Pyrex  and  Quartz  windows  and 

molybdenum  sample  holder.  The  gas  is  introduced  in  the  plasma  chamber  through  mass  flow 

controllers and pumped thanks to a 550 l/s turbomolecular pump followed by an oil rotary pump. The 

base  pressure  in  the  plasma  chamber  is  10-6  Pa  (measured  by  ionization  gauge).  We  studied  pure 

hydrogen plasma at powers 400, 600, 850 and 1000 W and at pressures from 1 to 10 Pa. The pressure 

during the plasma is measured by a capacitive gauge and is regulated by changing the pumping speed 

by modifying a gate valve opening placed between the plasma and the turbomolecular pump.  

A sample holder from Vegatec company is used to hold 4’’ wafers. The sample holder allows for 

wafer temperature measurement thanks to a backside thermocouple, wafer heating and cooling (from 

room  temperature  to  800°C)  using  backside  resistive  heater  and  backside  circulation  of  fluid  (air  or 

glycol-based liquid), wafer loading and clamping (the chamber is equipped with a load lock chamber), 

and biasing of the wafer down to -1 kV. The sample holder can be translated vertically. It was adjusted 

in a way so the surface of the sample would be at the position 0 cm on figure 1. In order to limit the 

plasma expansion and better define the wall conditions for surface loss measurements, a moving Pyrex 

tube  (external  diameter  170  mm,  thickness  5  mm,  height  146  mm)  has  been  installed in  the  plasma 

chamber. When the tube is in the upper position, the plasma is confined by the tube itself, the quartz 

window  on  top  and  the  sample  holder  on  bottom.  Pumping  openings  (~10  mm  typical  dimension) 

remain on top between the tube and the quartz window, and on bottom between the sample holder and 

the tube. At this position the middle of the tube is 5 cm from the  bottom side of the reactors quartz 

window  (also  from  the  sample  holders  surface).  When  the  tube  is  in  the  lower  position,  the  plasma 

created between the top antenna and the wafer holder extends towards the stainless steel walls. Most of 

the characterizations performed in this paper have been performed without the tube. For the purpose of 

spatial characterisation of the plasma, a 4’’ SiO2 was loaded on the sample holder and heated to 450 K 

during measurements. SiO2 was chosen as a reference  material because of  a large number of paper 

dedicated to atomic hydrogen loss on this material (Cartry et al 2000, Bousquet et al 2007, Kim and 

Boudart 1991, Kae-Nune et al 1996).  

In  all  cases,  the  gas  flow  rate  is  fixed  at  10  sccm.  For  atomic  hydrogen  determination  by 

actinometry  an  admixture  of  5  %  of  argon  was  used  in  hydrogen.  For  the  determination  of  the  gas 

temperature 5, 10, 15, 30, 50 % of admixtures of nitrogen were used in hydrogen. Signal is collected 

by  an  optical  fibre  through  quartz  lens  from  the  chamber.  The  collected  signal  is  recorded  with  an 

Andor  Mechelle  ME5000  spectrometer  coupled  with  an  Andor  iStar  intensified  camera  (DH734)  in 

wavelength ranging from 215 to 950 nm. Experimental spectra were corrected by the spectral response 

of spectrometer. Resolution of Mechelle spectrometer is λ/Δ λ = 4000.  

Plasma  parameters  as  electron  density  and  electron  temperatures  were  measured  by  RF-

compensated SmartSoft Langmuir probe with a tungsten tip of 10 mm long and 200 µm in diameter. 

4 

Langmuir probe was translatable and was positioned at the centre of the plasma chamber at a height of 

5 cm from the bottom part of the quartz window.  

The  transition  from  CCP  to  ICP  modes  is  identified  and  marked  for  all  evolutions  shown  here. 

Note that this transition, characterized by a hysteresis effect, occurred with a sudden change of both 

the emission intensity and the plasma density and it was triggered by changing the delivered power.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Electron density and electron temperature 

Measured  data  with  the  Langmuir  probe  (placed  in  the  centre  of  the  chamber/plasma,  height:  5  cm 

from  the  windows  lower  part)  were  processed  by  software  SmartSoftV5.01  from  Scientific  systems 

(Hopkins 1995). The electron temperature and electron density were determined with the help of the 

plasma potential, obtained using the zero second derivatives.  The figure 2 is depicting the measured 

electron  densities  in  pure  H2  as  function  of  power  and  pressure.  Overall,  the  electron  densities  are 

increasing  by  increasing  power  in  the  measured  range  of  pressure,  i.e.  between  1  and  10  Pa.  The 

transition  to  the  ICP  mode  is  characterized  by  a  sudden  jump  in  the  electron  densities  above 

~ 1010 cm-3. With increasing pressure this transition occurs at lower values of power. The mentioned 

hysteresis effect (Daltrini et al 2008, Kang and Gaboriau 2011) is evidenced, as for example at 4 Pa 

and 600 W the discharge can be both in ICP and CCP mode.

Overall,  the  electron  densities  are  increasing  by  increasing  power.  The  transition  from  CCP  to  ICP  discharge 
mode is marked with dashed line. With increasing pressure this transition occurs at lower values of power. 

The figure 3 presents the electron concentrations in the case of a H2-N2 plasma at the two pressure 

limit conditions, at 1 (a) and 10 Pa (b). We are reminding that the admixture of nitrogen was realized 

in order to help determining the gas temperature. However this affected the discharge properties and 

led to some changes in the electron concentration compared to the case of pure hydrogen. First of all 

the H2-N2 plasma is also characterized by rising values of ne with both pressure and power as in pure 

hydrogen and by a sudden increase of ne concerning the transition from CCP to ICP mode. However at 

1 Pa nitrogen causes important increase of the electron concentrations and even transition to the ICP 

mode  at  1000  W  and  50  %  N2  unlike  in  the  case  of  pure  H2.  Increasing  of  electron  density  with 

nitrogen  density  was  observed  before  and  explained  by  higher  ionization  cross  section  of    N2  in 

comparison  with  H2  (El-Brulsy  et  al  2012).  In  contrast,  at  10  Pa  approximately  the  same  trend  is 

observed for all dependences as in pure hydrogen, i.e. no important changes are induced with nitrogen 

addition.

realized to help determine the gas temperature, however this led to some changes in the electron concentration 
compared to the case of pure hydrogen. 

The Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) in pure H2 plasma is depicted in figure 4 for 

different  pressure  and  power  conditions.  Note,  that  there  were  no  important  changes  with  power  or 

mode of plasma for what concerns the shape of the EEDF. Maxwellian EEDF was obtained for lower 

pressure  and  it  was  changed  to  bi-Maxwellian  for  pressures  higher  than  4  Pa.  The  electron 

temperatures marked in the graph are merely informative. With decreasing pressure we see an increase 

of the high electron energy tail to the disadvantage of the lower energy part. In hydrogen the transition 

with  pressure  from  a  Maxwellian  to  a  bi-Maxwellian  EEDF  has  been  studied  previously  in  a  13.56 

MHz CCP discharge (Abdel-Fattah and Sugai 2013) and a bi-Maxwellian distribution reported at 10 

Pa in a pulsed ICP discharge (Osiac et al 2007). 

Measured  EEDF  was  used  for  calculation  of  rate  constants  used  in  actinometry  (paragraph  3.4) 

and in calculation of vibrational temperature (paragraph 3.3).

Maxwellian distribution. 

3.2. Gas temperature 

As  rotational-translational  relaxation  is  non-adiabatic,  fast  equilibrium  can  occur  between  rotational 

and translational degrees of freedom after few collisions (Britun et al 2007). For this reason, rotational 

temperature  of  ground  states  of  molecule  is  very  often  taken  as  gas  temperature.  One  of  the  most 
known emission system of hydrogen discharge in the visible range is Fulcher-α system (𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢
𝑎3𝛴𝑔

+)).  For  gas  temperature  determination  often  the  Q-branch  of  this  system  is  used  as  other

− →

branches,  P  and  R,  are  perturbed  by  Σ  states  (Qing  et  al  1996).  Rotational  temperature  of 
𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢

−) state determined from hydrogen Fulcher-α band is not very often in equilibrium with gas

cannot  be  thermalized.  Furthermore  hydrogen  needs  approximately  300  collisions  to  achieve

−) state.  So  𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢

equilibrium (Farley et al 2011) while 5-10 collisions are required for nitrogen. According to Tomasini 

et al (1996), the collision frequency as a function of the pressure is given by: υcoll/p=8×106 s-1Torr-1. 
The emission probability of 𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢
as  in  our  experimental  conditions,  the  equilibrium  cannot  be  ensured.  However,  under  our 
experimental conditions, the excited state 𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢
from the ground state. If the electron impact rate coefficient is constant over the rotational levels, and 

−) is 4×107 s-1. If υcoll is much lower than the emission probability,

−)  is mainly populated through electron collisions

if the transitions without change of angular momentum are dominant, then the rotational distribution 
of  the  𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢

−)  is  a  copy  of  the  ground  state  distribution,  and  the  rotational  temperature  can  be

determined  from  Flucher-  band.  It  has  been  checked  that  these  assumptions  can  be  considered  as 

valid  for  the  Q branch  of  Fulcher  band  (De  Graaf  1994,  Gans  et  al  2001).  Therefore,  the  rotational 

temperature  determined  from  this  band is  a  good  approximation  of the  rotational temperature  of  the 

ground state. Then it is assumed that rotational and translational temperature (gas temperature) are in 

equilibrium. Intensity of rotational line is given as (N quantum number can be used instead of J)

is  Hönl-London  factor,  Trot  is  rotational  temperature  of  the  state  and 𝐹𝑑𝑣′𝑁′ =

𝐵𝑣𝑁(𝑁 + 1) is the rotational energy. The total nuclear spin due to presence of orto- (Γ𝑁′= 1) and para-

states (Γ𝑁′= 0) of H2 is taken into account, where Γ𝑁′= 1 for N’ even and Γ𝑁′= 0 for N’ odd. Rotational
temperature of 𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢
−) is then determined assuming a Boltzmann distribution of rotational states.
The  rotational  constant  of  𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

+)  has  to  be  used  for  the  calculation  (since  the  rotational

distribution  of  the  excited  state  is  a  copy  from  the  ground  state  one).  However,  as  the  rotational 
constant of 𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔
= 2Bυ), then it simply applies: Trot(𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

Fulcher-α band (pure H2, 4 Pa, 1000 W). 

It was observed by Fantz (2002) and also by Tsankov et al (2012) that temperatures determined 

from  different  diagonal bands  are  not equal. This  observation is not explained,  yet.  Fantz  compared 

different spectroscopic techniques and she found out that temperature determined by vibrational bands 

1-1 and 2-2 are the most close to the real gas temperature. For this reason we concentrated on these 

bands.  We  have  chosen  the  transition  1-1  (at  =  612-616  nm)  because  of  the  higher  intensity  of 

rotational  lines  compared  to  the  vibrational  band  2-2.  Note,  that  the  experimental  error  on  the 

determination of the rotational temperatures is ± 50 K, coming from the accuracy of the fit. It means 

that  the  error  for  the  gas  temperature  from  the  Fulcher-α  system  is  ±  100  K.  The  determined  gas 

temperatures in pure hydrogen are depicted on figure 6 (a). Gas temperature in CCP mode was equal 

to an average value of 450 ± 50 K and did not depend on pressure or on delivered power. It is a non-

heating mode where a large portion of energy goes accelerating the ions in the plasma sheath and is 

not used to heat the gas through electron collisions. On the other hand, ICP mode can be characterized 

by collisional heating. In this so called heating mode the gas temperature was increasing because more 

energy was transferred to the plasma with increasing power and with pressure, the plasma density was 

increasing leading to more frequent collisions and larger energy transfer from electrons to neutral gas. 

Gas temperature was increasing with highest  slope at 10 Pa from 525 (400 W) to 800 K (1000 W). 

Similar values were obtained recently in a high density low-pressure hydrogen discharge (Samuell and 

Corr 2015). 

In the case of nitrogen admixture, we compared the gas temperatures determined by the Fulcher- 

system and the second positive system of nitrogen (𝑁2(𝐶3𝛱𝑢 → 𝐵3Π𝑔 )), noted 2PS. We suppose that

rotational temperature of 2PS is equal to gas temperature (Fantz 2004, Behringer 1991). In the latter 

case the vibrational transition v’- v’’ = 1-0 (at  = 315.8 nm) was used being the most intense one in

spectral  simulations  using  the  software  SPECAIR  (Laux  2002)  we  determined  the  rotational 

temperature of the 𝑁2(𝐶3𝛱𝑢 ) state which can be considered as the gas temperature with an error of ±
50  K.  The  Fulcher-α  system  could  be  used  for  the  determination  of  Tg  only  at  5,  10  and  15  %  of 

nitrogen  added,  as  at  higher  percentages  of  N2  (30  and  50  %)  the  first  positive  system  of  nitrogen 

(𝑁2(𝐵3Π𝑔 → 𝐴3Σ𝑢

+)) overlapped with the bands from Fulcher- Concerning the pressure dependence

of the gas temperature in the case of nitrogen admixtures, the behaviour is equivalent to that in pure 

hydrogen. Therefore the figure 6 (b) presents the results as function of power and nitrogen percentage 

in  the  mixture  only  in  the  case  of  the  pressure  of  10  Pa.  First  of  all,  the  results  using  2PS  and  the 

Fulcher- system are in quite good agreement. Even if the error bar are quite large, it reinforces the 

confidence  in  the  gas  temperature  determination  from  the  Fulcher-  system.  There  is  only  one 

noticeable difference between the gas temperatures determined from both systems: at 10 Pa and 1000 

W the second positive system is giving a temperature lower than the Fulcher system.  The discharge 

was in ICP mode for powers higher than 400 W under the presence of nitrogen admixture. At 400 W, 

discharge can be in ICP and CCP mode in pure hydrogen and also with 5 % of nitrogen. The transition 

causes  additional  heating  of  the  gas  as  stated  before.  Thus  for  H2-N2  mixtures  also  higher  gas 

temperature values were determined in the ICP mode. For a given power the gas temperature changes 

with nitrogen admixture  seems  to  be  related  to  the  uncertainty  in  the  measurements  rather than  to  a 

real  change  of  heating  mechanism.  On  the  average, in  ICP  mode  the  gas  temperature  in  mixtures is 

close  to  the  value  determined  in  pure  hydrogen  discharge.  In  CCP  mode  with  N2  admixture  Tg  was 

equal to the value determined for pure hydrogen within the determination uncertainty (see the case of 

400 W).

The gas temperature is noticeably higher in the inductive mode than in the capacitive mode where no significant 

heating  is  measured.  Gas  temperature  variations  measured  with  Fulcher-α  and  second  positive  system  are  in 

quite good agreement. 

For  determination  of  the  reflection  coefficient  of  atomic  hydrogen,  it  is  possible  to  use  pulsed-

discharge and measure the atomic decay in time afterglow. As the gas temperature can influence the 

decay of atomic hydrogen, we have performed to time resolved measurements of the gas temperature 

during  pulsed  plasmas.  A  duty  ratio  of  ON:OFF  =  50 ms:  50 ms  was  used  for  investigation  of  the 

temporal evolution of gas temperature. The Tg values were determined by 2PS and Fulcher- systems, 

as  described  above  and  using  the  transitions  mentioned  previously.  In  the  pulsed  regime,  for  a  gas 

mixture with 50 % nitrogen the Fulcher-α system was not influenced by the first positive system of 

nitrogen  and  could  also  be  used.  The  results  are  presented  on  figure  7  for  two  measured  pressure 

conditions.  The  temperature  is  increasing  during  the  pulse  and  reaches  a  stationary  value  after  ~1.5 

ms. At that time the value of Tg in the continuous discharge is achieved. Note that the 2PS at 10 Pa and 

1000W is giving a temperature noticeably lower that the Fulcher system, as already observed in the 

continuous  mode.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  gas  temperature  during  the  OFF  phase  because  of 

short lifetime of excited states.

discharge.  The  temperature  is  increasing  during  the  pulse  and  reaches  a  stationary  value  after  ~1.5  ms,  which 

corresponds to the value of Tg in the continuous discharge. 

The reflection coefficient can be strongly influenced also by the temperature of the sample which 

can in turn also change the gas temperature. At low pressures the gas particles collide with the surfaces 

of  the  chamber  much  more  often  than  between  each  other  and  their  loss  depends  on  the  surface

without Pyrex tube at 1000 W and pressures of 4 and 10 Pa while the sample was heated to 450 K or 

maintained at 300 K by liquid cooling. If the temperature of sample is changed, gas temperature will 

be changed according to the difference of sample temperature. This is in agreement with figures 8 (a) 

and  (b),  which  present  the  evolution  of  the  gas  temperature  at  4  and  10  Pa,  respectively,  with  and 

without  the  Pyrex  tube  and  at  different  sample  temperatures.  For  the  determination  of  Tg  the  same 

transition of the Fulcher- system was used as in the cases above. The change of sample temperature 

about 150 K changed gas temperature approximately from 650 K to 800 K at 4 Pa (without tube) and 

from  800  K  to  950  K  at  10  Pa  (without  tube).  The  Pyrex  tube  delimited  the  chamber  and  also  the 

discharge  to  smaller  dimensions,  thus  the  power  density  was  higher.  That  induced  higher  gas 

temperature when Pyrex tube was used. Difference between Tg with and without Pyrex tube is lower at 

10 Pa because plasma was not that spatially extended at higher pressure without the tube.

Other  measurements  are  done  at  450  K  of  sample  holder.  The  Pyrex  tube  delimited  the  chamber  and  also  the

including the Gryzinsky theory, as Xiao et al (2004), to calculate the rate constants in order to describe 
the vibrational distribution of the 𝐻2(𝑑3𝛱𝑢

 The figure 10 presents the determined vibrational temperatures of the ground state as function of 

pressure  and  delivered  power.  The  error  of  the  method  is  equal  to  ~  ±  500  K  that  comes  from 

uncertainty  of  rotational  temperature  and  determination  intensity  of  rotational  lines.  Vibrational 

temperatures  are  approximately  constant  as  function  of  pressure  and  power  for  a  given  mode,  but 

differ markedly in CCP and  ICP  modes.  In the CCP  mode the temperature is lower than in the ICP 

mode by about 1000 K. Overall Tvib does not exceed the value of 3500 ± 500 K. Average vibrational 
temperature of 𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

+, 𝑣)  is 3100 and 2000 ± 500 K in ICP and CCP mode, respectively.

delivered  powers.  The  samples  temperature  was  held  at  300  K  (without  Pyrex  tube).  The  vibrational 

temperatures are constant with pressure and power but differ markedly between the two discharge modes. 

Within the given uncertainties the value of the vibrational temperature of the ground state in the 

spatial  direction  can  be  considered  constant.  At  4  Pa,  1000  W  and  sample  temperature  450  K  the 

average value is equal to 3500 and 4100 ± 500 K without and with Pyrex tube, respectively, and at 

higher pressure (10 Pa, 1000 W and sample temperature 450 K) the averaged vibrational temperature 

is equal to 3700 and 3300 ± 500 K without and with Pyrex tube, respectively.  

Without  a  complete  kinetic  modelling  of  the  hydrogen  discharge,  it  is  hard  to  comment  the 

changes of the vibrational temperature with power, distance from the sample or presence of the Pyrex 

tube. Indeed, many parameters play a role on the population/depopulation of H2 vibrational sates, and 

still some of them are not well documented. For instance, it is known that  vibrational population  of 
𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

+, 𝑣) can be influenced by surface recombination of atomic hydrogen that creates vibrationally

excited molecules (Cacciatore and Rutigliano 2006, 2009), but the exact amount of energy going into

deactivation of vibrationnally excited molecules is also a subject of research upon which very few is 

known (Marinov et al 2012, 2014 b, Samuell 2014). Vibrationally excited states are also populated by 

electron impact and V-V transfers, and depopulated by V-V transfers and V-T transfers with H atoms. 

Finally,  the  vibrational  population  might  also  be  affected  by  ion-  molecules  collisions  (Xiao  et  al 

2005). Many models and studies have been dedicated to the vibrational temperature of H2, taking into 

account some of the mechanism described above (Mendez et al 2006, Shakhatov et al 2005, Gorse et 

al  1987,  Hjartarson  et  al  2010,  Xiao  et  al  2005).  Let  us  note  that  according  to  Fantz  et  al  (2001) 

electron  density  has  influence  on  vibrational  distribution for  electron  temperatures  higher than 4  eV 

and  electron  densities  at  least  1011  cm-3  .  In  our  study  we  obtained  lower  values  for  ne  and  Te. 

Therefore  we  can  suspect  an  effect  of  the  wall  material  when  the  Pyrex  tube  is  introduced  and  the 

vibrational temperature is decreased at 4 Pa.  

Kalache  et  al  (2004)  found  out  that  concentration  of  negative  ions  is  negligible  for  vibrational 

temperatures lower than 3000 K. For temperatures higher than 3000 K, concentrations of negative ions 

increases  exponentially.  Kimura  and  Kasugai  (2010)  supposed  creation  of  negative  ions  by 
dissociative attachment from the vibrationally excited hydrogen molecules of 𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

+, 𝑣) with v ≥ 4

and their destruction by detachment collision with atomic hydrogen. They characterised concentration 

of negative ions by electronegativity, : 

α = Cad

[H2(v≥4)]
[H]

 , 

(11) 

where  Cad  is  the  ratio  of  rate  coefficient  for  the  dissociative  attachment  to  that  for  the  detachment, 

estimated to be around 10 at maximum (Zorat  et al 2000, Janev et al 1987, Graham 1995). H is the 

concentration of hydrogen atoms and is obtained from actinometry (see section 3.4.3.). The figure 11 

is  depicting  the  calculated  values  of  electronegativity  according  to  equation  (11)  as  function  of 

pressure for two powers. The electronegativity α is below 0.01 in CCP mode and below 0.4 in the case 

of ICP mode. Thus we can assume that the concentration of negative ions is negligible in CCP mode.

3.4. Estimation of concentration of atomic hydrogen  

We used two actinometric schemes to determine the H atom concentrations by employing either argon 

or H2 molecules as actinometer. First we discuss the theory behind the two studies (see sections 3.4.1. 

and 3.4.2.), and then we present the results (see section 3.4.3.). 

3.4.1.  Actinometric  study  with  argon  admixture.  We  used  5  %  of  argon  as  actinometer.  The  basic 

assumption is that this  amount  will  not  change  significantly  the  discharge  properties.  The  following 

processes were taken into consideration, where i and j refer to electronic excited states.

3.4.2. Actinometric study in pure hydrogen. The rotational line with N = 1 of Q-branch of Fulcher-α

3.4.3. Comparison of results from the two actinometric studies. The figure 12 (a) and (b) presents the 

evolution of hydrogen atoms concentration with pressure for 400 and 1000 W calculated using argon 

or H2 as actinometers. In the case of argon, the Ar transition from 2p1 to 1s2 at 750.4 nm has been used 

and two different H transitions have been employed: H-alpha line at 656 nm (figure 12 (a)) and H-beta 

line at 486 nm (figure 12 (b)). For hydrogen, Q branch of Fulcher-α band has been used.  

18 

 
 
 
 
First we can note that the two hydrogen transitions are giving different results. Actinometry using 

H-alpha line results higher concentrations of atomic hydrogen than using H-beta line. Similar results 

were  observed  by  Skoro  et  al  (2013).  They  observed  better  agreement  between  atomic  hydrogen 

concentrations  determined  from  actinometry  and  from  catalytic  probe  measurements  when  using  H-

beta line rather than H-alpha. Therefore we have considered the H-beta line for further calculations. 

We can see also, that Fulcher- and argon actinometry (H-beta) are in good agreement (figure 12 (b)) 

which is not the case for the results obtained with H-alpha line (figure 12 (a)), confirming that the use 

of H-alpha should be avoided here. The presented graph shows the evolution of H atom concentrations 

in the CCP and ICP modes with pressure between 2 and 10 Pa. In general, the H atom concentration is 

increasing with the pressure. Surprisingly, we have obtained higher H concentration in the CCP mode 

than  in  ICP  mode,  with  densities  ranging  from  around  1.5×1013  to  7.5×1013  cm-3  in  CCP  and  from 

1×1013  to  4×1013  cm-3  in  the  ICP  mode  with  increasing  pressure  from  3  to  10  Pa.  This  point  is 

discussed later.  Relative to previous works, comparable values of hydrogen concentration were found 

by Mendez et al (2006) in a DC discharge with values between 1013-1014×cm-3 in pressure range 1-10 

Pa at electron densities between 1-3×1010 cm-3 and decreasing  electron temperature from 8 to 2 eV. 

Marques  et  al  (2007)  measured  a  value  of  7×1013  cm-3  but  at  higher  pressure,  26  Pa,  with  electron 

density up to 4×109 cm-3 and electron temperature of 3 eV in a CCP RF discharge at 13.56 MHz. At 

lower  pressure,  1  Pa,  in  a  helicon  type  reactor  Skoro  et  al  (2013)  determined  concentration  of 

hydrogen atoms between 5-9×1012 cm-3 at powers ranging between 800 and 1000 W.

Figure  12.  Evolution  of  atomic  hydrogen  concentrations  with  pressure  at  400  and  1000  W  while  the  sample 

holder  temperature  was held at 300K (without sample).  On graphs (a) and (b) we are presenting the results  of 

actinometric technique  using the H-alpha and H-beta lines, respectively. The Fulcher- and argon actinometry 

with  H-beta  line  are  in  good  agreement,  the  use  of  H-alpha  should  be  avoided.  The  resulted  H  atom 

concentration is increasing with the pressure. 

The figure 13 is depicting the evolution of the dissociation ratio as function of pressure at 400 and 

1000 W representing the two discharge modes. Dissociation ratio increases from 2.7 % at 3 Pa to 4.1

% at 10 Pa in ICP  mode and from 2.3 % at 3 Pa to 3.5 % at 10 Pa in CCP mode. We can observe 

higher  dissociation  ratio  in  the  ICP  mode  than  CCP  mode.  At  first  sight  this  seems  to  be  in 

disagreement with the evolution of H atom concentrations presented on figure 12 (b), where we obtain 

lower  H  atom  concentrations  in  ICP  mode  compared  to  the  CCP  mode.  In  fact,  the  lower 

concentrations in the ICP mode are caused by increasing gas temperature which induces a decrease of 

hydrogen  molecule  density  (and  therefore  of  hydrogen  dissociation).  Still,  it  is  surprising  that 

dissociation  degree  in  ICP  and  CCP  mode  are  so  close  while  electron  density  are  differing  by  one 

order  of  magnitude.  This  might  be  due  to  the  increased  ion  flux  to  the  wall  that  leads  to  a  higher 

atomic loss at the wall as observed or suggested in different works (Samuell and Corr 2015, Cartry et 

al 1999, Jolly and Booth 2005). Regarding the literature, the obtained dissociation is comparable with 

results of other works. In the work of Hjartarson et al (2010) the dissociation was 25 % at 0.53 Pa, 20 

% at 1 Pa and 5 % at 13Pa in pure H2 discharge. Dissociation ratio decreased from 17 % to 7 % in 

pressure range 0.8 to 20 Pa  according to the article of Mendez et al (2006) combining experimental 

and theoretical study on a hollow cathode DC discharge. 

Figure 13. Dissociation ratio as function of pressure at 400 and 1000 W. The dissociation ratio is higher in the 

ICP mode than CCP mode. 

We also measured the temporal evolution of the H atom concentrations in the pulsed mode. We 

observed an initial fast increase (shorter than 5 ms), and then the H density are reaching more or less 

the  value  reached  in  non-pulsed  mode.  At  the  end  of  the  discharge  pulse,  the  H  density  reaches 

1.5×1013 and 4.5×1013 cm-3 at 4 and 10 Pa, respectively. 

 The figure 14 presents the evolution of the H atom concentrations as function of distance from 

the sample holder at 4 and 10 Pa with delivered power of 1000 W. Argon actinometry with H-beta was 

used here. We observe higher density with the tube than without. This is due both to the higher power 

density  (discharge  volume  is  smaller  with  the  tube)  and  to the  use  of  Pyrex  as wall  material  (rather 

than stainless steel) allowing to reduce atomic loss. Indeed, surface loss on glass materials is usually

much lower than on metals, ~ one order of difference  (e.g. for glass: Cartry et al 2000, Macko et al 

2004, Rousseau et al 2001; e.g. for metals: Sode et al 2014). The concentration at 10 Pa is higher than 

at 4 Pa by a factor between 2.5 a 5. For both pressures there is a slight rise in atomic concentration 

with  increasing  distance  from  the  sample  holder.  It  is  correlated  to  the  loss  of  atoms  at  the  sample 

surface. Loss coefficient can theoretically be determined from the slope. However, the determination 

is quite hard in presence of temperature gradients (Booth et al 2005) as it is in the case in the present 

study.

Pyrex tube (empty  circle) and  without Pyrex tube (full circle) at power of 1000 W and temperature  of sample 

holder 450 K. The gas mixture was H2 / 5 % Ar. H-beta line has been used. The H atom concentration is higher 

with the tube due to higher power density and the choice of wall material, as Pyrex is reducing atomic loss. 

4. Conclusion

This  study  presents  a  preliminary  characterisation  of  a  hydrogen  plasma  source,  proposed  for  the 

determination  of  the  reflection  coefficient  for  fusion  related  studies.  Within  the  framework  of  this 

project, a hydrogen RF discharge was studied at frequency of 13.56 MHz, at pressures between 4 and 

10 Pa, and for power in range of 400 - 1000 W. The characterization of the plasma was realized by 

means of optical emission spectroscopy in both CCP and ICP discharge modes. Moreover Langmuir 

probe measurements were carried out in order to determine the electron  energy  distribution function 

and  electron  density.  Some  measurements  were  realized  in  admixtures  of  nitrogen  up  to  50  %  and 

actinometry  measurements  in  5  %  argon.  Additionally,  for  some  cases  of  the  studied  discharge 

parameters  the  analysis  of  a  pulsed  discharge  with  duty  ratio  50:50  has  been  included.  The 

experimental  set-up  allowed  the  investigation  of  the  plasma  in  the  presence  of  a  sample  or  in  the 

absence  of  it.  For  some  measurements  a  Pyrex  tube  was  used  which  delimited  the  volume  of  the 

discharge, allowing for a better definition of wall conditions for surface loss measurements. Note, that 

the  placement  of  the  sample  (SiO2)  within  the  experimental  set-up  allowed  the  interaction  with  the 

plasma, while the sample holder (made of molybdenum) could be heated to a desired temperature.

The transition to the ICP mode was characterized by a sudden jump in the electron densities above ~ 

1010 cm-3, observed for both pure hydrogen and in a H2-N2 discharge. The energy distribution function 

of electrons was found to be a Maxwellian one at low pressure, but for increasing pressure it gradually 

changed to a bi-Maxwellian one at around 4 Pa. There was no power dependence observed. 

The gas temperature in the CCP discharge mode was constant with pressure and power with an 

average  value  of  450  ±  50  K.  In  the  ICP  mode  the  gas  temperature  was  increasing  with  increasing 

pressure  and  power,  in  accord  with  the  literature.  These  values  were  obtained  from  the  Fulcher- 

system of hydrogen, but also confirmed by H2-N2 mixtures by the second positive system of nitrogen. 

For  the  case  of  a  pulsed  discharge,  the  temperature  was  increasing  during  the  pulse  and  reached  a 

stationary value after ~1.5 ms, which corresponded to the value of the continuous discharge.  

The vibrational temperature of the ground state 𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

+, 𝑣) molecule was determined using the

Gryzinski theory. The corresponding functions were found to be approximately constant with respect 

to both pressure and power for a given mode, but differ significantly between CCP and ICP modes. 
Average vibrational temperature of 𝐻2(𝑋1𝛴𝑔

+, 𝑣)  was 3100 and 2000 ± 500 K in ICP and CCP mode

respectively. The vibrational temperature was also studied as a function of distance from the sample. 

Based on calculations of the electronegativity, found to be 0.01 in CCP  mode and below 0.4 in 

ICP mode, and also referring to previous studies, the concentration of negative ions is assumed to be 

negligible in CCP mode.  

Atomic hydrogen concentration was determined by actinometry using 5 % of Ar as a probing gas, 

or  by  using  the  Q1  rotational  line  of  Fulcher-α  system  as  actinometer.  Concentration  of  hydrogen 

density was increasing with pressure in  both modes (from around 1.5×1013 to 7.5×1013 cm-3 in CCP 

and from 1×1013 to 4×1013 cm-3 in the ICP mode with increasing pressure from 3 to 10 Pa), but with a 

dissociation  degree  slightly  higher  (by  a  factor  of  2)  in  the  ICP  mode.  In  the  case  of  a  pulsed 

discharge,  an  initial  fast  increase  of  atomic  concentration  was  observed.  Then,  at  around  5  ms,  the 

value reached the value of the continuous mode.  

The presented study will be a starting point for further calculations of reflection coefficient versus 

experimental conditions. This kind of study requires a good knowledge and good characterization of 

the  plasma  for  two  main  reasons.  The  first  one  concerns  the  measurement  of  the  loss  coefficient  in 

itself that can be badly estimated if effects such as gas temperature and neutral density variations are 

not well managed (Cartry et al 2006, Lamara et al 2006). Second, a key point in surface loss studies is 

the identification of the parameters playing a role on the surface loss coefficient. The external control 

“knobs”  of  the  plasma  (pressure,  power…)  affect  several  plasma  parameters  and  several  species 

concentration at the same time. Unraveling the influence of all plasma parameters on the surface loss 

coefficient thus requires a complete characterization of the plasma versus the experimental conditions. 

Using  the  present  experimental  device,  the  ion  flux  can  be  varied  in  a  controlled  manner,  the  gas 

22 

temperature is known and most of the plasma parameters are estimated. This is a pre-requisite for H 

atomic loss coefficient studies.
