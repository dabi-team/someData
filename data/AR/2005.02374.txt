ABSTRACT

We analyse the transmission and emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76 b, observed
with the G141 grism of the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). We reduce and
ﬁt the raw data for each observation using the open-source software Iraclis before performing a fully
Bayesian retrieval using the publicly available analysis suite TauRex 3. Previous studies of the WFC3
transmission spectra of WASP-76 b found hints of titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) or
non-grey clouds. Accounting for a fainter stellar companion to WASP-76, we reanalyse this data and
show that removing the eﬀects of this background star changes the slope of the spectrum, resulting
in these visible absorbers no longer being detected, eliminating the need for a non-grey cloud model
to adequately ﬁt the data but maintaining the strong water feature previously seen. However, our
analysis of the emission spectrum suggests the presence of TiO and an atmospheric thermal inversion,
along with a signiﬁcant amount of water. Given the brightness of the host star and the size of the
atmospheric features, WASP-76 b is an excellent target for further characterisation with HST, or with
future facilities, to better understand the nature of its atmosphere, to conﬁrm the presence of TiO and
to search for other optical absorbers.

1. INTRODUCTION

Ultra-hot Jupiters are an intriguing population of exo-
planets. With dayside temperatures greater than ∼2000
K, these planets were truly unexpected and continue
to unveil surprising traits. Despite being a rare out-
come of planetary formation, many have been found
using ground-based surveys such as the Wide Angle
Search for Planets (WASP, Pollacco et al. (2006)), the
Hungarian Automated Telescope network (HAT, Bakos
et al. (2013)) and Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope
(KELT, Pepper et al. (2007)). Given their size and tem-
perature, as well as the brightness of their host stars,
these planets are excellent targets for atmospheric char-
acterisation. Moreover, they oﬀer the opportunity to
explore atmospheric chemistry and dynamics in extreme
conditions. Understanding their composition, and thus
their metallicity and carbon to oxygen ratio, is crucial
for constraining formation and migration theories (Ven-
turini et al. 2016; Madhusudhan et al. 2017).

The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) onboard the Hub-
ble Space Telescope (HST) has, along with Spitzer’s
InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC), been at the forefront
of characterising these planets. These very hot atmo-
spheres were predicted to have inverted temperature-
pressure proﬁles due to strong optical absorption by TiO
and VO (Hubeny et al. 2003; Fortney et al. 2008). HST
observations of two cooler hot Jupiters (T < 2000 K) de-
tected non-inverted temperature proﬁles for WASP-43 b
(Stevenson et al. 2014b) and HD 209458 b (Line et al.
2016), which are consistent with the theoretical predic-
tions of Fortney et al. (2008). However, observations of
the emission spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters have, thus far,
been inconclusive on their thermal structure and com-
position. While some have shown features due to water
or optical absorbers, others are consistent with a sim-
ple blackbody ﬁt (e.g. Madhusudhan et al. 2011; Haynes
et al. 2015; Beatty et al. 2017; Evans et al. 2016, 2017,
2018; Arcangeli et al. 2018; Kreidberg et al. 2018; Mikal-
Evans et al. 2019; Bourrier et al. 2019). This variety may
well be because the emission spectrum in this band-pass
is dependent on both the water content and the thermal
structure of the planet, and the G141 grism (1.1-1.7 µm)
probes a region of the atmosphere where the tempera-
ture only varies slowly with pressure (Parmentier et al.
2018; Mansﬁeld et al. 2018).

Upon the discovery of a companion, WASP-76 became
the brightest star known to host a planet with a radius
greater than 1.5 RJ (West et al. 2016). While brighter
targets have since been discovered, WASP-76 b is still
one of the best currently-known targets for atmospheric
characterisation and the transmission spectrum was ob-
served by the HST in November 2015. The observa-

tions were taken with the WFC3 using the G141 grism
which covers 1.1-1.7 µm. This spectrum was analysed
by Tsiaras et al. (2018) as part of a population study
of 30 gaseous exoplanets. Retrievals by Tsiaras et al.
(2018) suggested a water rich atmosphere (log(H2O) =
−2.7±1.07) with a 4.4σ detection of TiO and VO. How-
ever, as noted in the study, the abundances of TiO re-
trieved were likely to be nonphysical and aﬀected by
correlations between the molecular abundances, planet
radius and cloud pressure.

Retrieval analysis of this spectrum was also performed
by Fisher & Heng (2018), who extracted a water abun-
dance which was incompatible with the previous study
(log(H2O) = −5.3 ± 0.61). Fisher & Heng (2018) did
not ﬁt for TiO or VO but instead used a non-grey
cloud model to explain the opacity seen at shorter wave-
lengths. WASP-76 b was one of two planets from their
study of 38 transmission spectra that was not well-ﬁtted
using the standard grey cloud model.

High resolution ground-based observations oﬀer the
opportunity to resolve the spectral lines of exoplanet
atmospheres and the High Accuracy Radial velocity
Planet Searcher (HARPS, Pepe et al. (2000)) was used
to analyse WASP-76b and ﬁnd evidence for absorption
due to sodium (Seidel et al. 2019; k et al. 2019). Recent
work by von Essen et al. (2020) using transmission data
from Hubble’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) conﬁrmed the presence of sodium and provided
marginal evidence of titanium hydride (TiH).

Two transits of WASP-76 b were observed using the
Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable
Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) instrument
on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and used to reveal an
asymmetric absorption signature which was attributed
to neutral iron (Fe, Ehrenreich et al. (2020)). The sig-
nature was blue-shifted on the trailing limb, proving ev-
idence for strong day-to-night winds and an asymmetric
dayside. However, the lack of signal on the leading limb
means little Fe is present there and thus must be con-
densing on the nightside.

Here we present an analysis of the transmission and
emission spectra of WASP-76 b, taken with the WFC3
G141 grism aboard HST. Although not reported in the
discovery paper (West et al. 2016), the presence of a
stellar companion was noted in several studies (W¨ollert
& Brandner 2015; Ginski et al. 2016; Ngo et al. 2016;
Bohn et al. 2020) and the common proper motion of the
two objects was conﬁrmed by Southworth et al. (2020).
This was not accounted for in previous WFC3 transmis-
sion studies and, using Wayne simulations (Varley et al.
2017), we show that this companion aﬀects the spectral
data obtained. We use Wayne to remove the contam-

ination of the companion and reanalyse the transmis-
sion spectrum ﬁnding evidence for H2O but, while we
were able to place upper limits on the TiO, VO, and
FeH abundances, we were unable to well constrain other
molecules. In the emission spectrum, we ﬁnd indications
of the presence of H2O and TiO, along with a thermal
inversion. Additionally we place upper limits on the
abundances of FeH and VO.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. Data Reduction

Our analysis started from the raw spatially scanned
spectroscopic images which were obtained from the
Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes1. The transmis-
sion spectrum was acquired as part of proposal 14260,
taken in November 2015, while the observation of the
eclipse was taken during proposal 14767 in November
2016. We used Iraclis2, a specialised, open-source soft-
ware for the analysis of WFC3 scanning observations
(Tsiaras et al. 2016b) and the reduction process in-
cluded the following steps: zero-read subtraction, ref-
erence pixels correction, non-linearity correction, dark
current subtraction, gain conversion, sky background
subtraction, calibration, ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, and cor-
rections for bad pixels and cosmic rays. For a detailed
description of these steps, we refer the reader to the
original Iraclis paper (Tsiaras et al. 2016b).

The reduced spatially scanned spectroscopic images
were then used to extract the white (from 1.1-1.7 µm)
and spectral light curves. The spectral light curves
bands were selected such that the SNR is approxi-
mately uniform across the planetary spectrum. We then
discarded the ﬁrst orbit of each visit as they present
stronger wavelength-dependent ramps, and the ﬁrst ex-
posure after each buﬀer dump as these contain signif-
icantly lower counts than subsequent exposures (e.g.
Deming et al. 2013; Tsiaras et al. 2016b; Mansﬁeld et al.
2018). Additionally, for the third orbit of the transit,
two further scans were removed to increase the qual-
ity of the ﬁt (e.g. Kreidberg et al. 2018). For the ﬁt-
ting of the white light curves, the only free parameters
were the mid-transit time and planet-to-star ratio. Alex-
oudi et al. (2018) showed that the inclination can have
a strong eﬀect on the derived slope of optical transmis-
sion data. We therefore checked that our results were
not aﬀected in this way by running light curve ﬁttings
with the inclination as a free parameter. The spectral
transit depths from these ﬁttings did not diﬀer from the

ﬁxed inclination case. However, the best-ﬁt inclinations
diﬀered between the transit and eclipse light curve and
so the orbital parameters were set to values from Ehren-
reich et al. (2020). The limb-darkening coeﬃcients were
selected from the best available stellar parameters using
values from Claret et al. (2012, 2013) and using the stel-
lar parameters from Ehrenreich et al. (2020). We did not
ﬁt for the limb darkening coeﬃcients as they are degen-
erate with other parameters, particularly given the peri-
odic gaps in the HST data. Tsiaras et al. (2018) showed
that ﬁtting the limb darkening coeﬃcients doesn’t gen-
erally aﬀect the recovered spectrum and Morello et al.
(2017) showed that uncertainties in stellar models do not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the atmospheric spectra in the WFC3
spectral band. The ﬁtted white light curves for both ob-
servations are shown in Figure 1 while the spectral light
curves are plotted in Figures 2 and 3.

2.2. Removal of Companion Contamination

The stellar companion of WASP-76, reported by Bohn
et al. (2020) and Southworth et al. (2020) has a K mag-
nitude which is ∼2.30 fainter and the separation between
both stars is only 0.436”. As such it is expected to have
contaminated the transmission and emission spectra ob-

4

tained by Hubble. For exoplanet spectroscopy, this third
light modiﬁes the transit/eclipse depth. For the Hubble
STIS observations analysed by von Essen et al. (2020),
the point spread functions (PSFs) of WASP-76 and its
companion could be distinguished. However, due to the
plate scale of HST WFC3 it is not resolvable in this case.
Hence, to account for this, we used the freely available
WFC3 simulator Wayne3.

Wayne is capable of producing grism spectroscopic
frames, both in staring and in spatial scanning modes
(Varley et al. 2017). Using the stellar parameters from
Bohn et al. (2020), we utilised Wayne to model the con-
tribution of the companion star to the spectral data ob-
tained. We created simulated detector images of both
the main and companion star, using these to extract the
ﬂux contribution in each spectral bin of each star. The
correction to the spectra is then applied as a wavelength
dependant dilution factor which is derived as a ratio of
extracted ﬂux between the stars. Such an approach has
previously been used on WFC3 data (e.g.
for WASP-
12 b Stevenson et al. (2014a); Kreidberg et al. (2015);
Tsiaras et al. (2018)). The recovered transmission and
emission spectra, before and after the correction was
applied, are shown in Figure 4 along with the correc-
tion factor used. The values are also given in Table
3, along with the corrected transmission and emission
depths. Two trends are seen: ﬁrstly, the transit and
eclipse depths are increased and, secondly, the slope of
the spectrum is changed in each case due to the diﬀering
spectral types of the stars.

2.3. Atmospheric Modelling

The retrieval of the transmission and emission spec-
trum were performed using the publicly available re-
trieval suite TauREx 3 (Al-Refaie et al. 2019)4. For
the star parameters and the planet mass, we used the
values from Ehrenreich et al. (2020) listed in Table 1.
In our runs we assumed that WASP-76 b possesses a
primary atmosphere with a ratio H2/He = 0.17. To this
we added trace gases and included the molecular opaci-
ties from the ExoMol (Tennyson et al. 2016), HITRAN
(Gordon et al. 2016) and HITEMP (Rothman & Gordon
2014) databases for: H2O (Polyansky et al. 2018), CH4
(Yurchenko & Tennyson 2014), CO (Li et al. 2015), CO2
(Rothman et al. 2010), FeH (Dulick et al. 2003; Wende
et al. 2010), TiO (McKemmish et al. 2019), VO (McK-
emmish et al. 2016) and H-. On top of this, we also
included Collision Induced Absorption (CIA) from H2-
H2 (Abel et al. 2011; Fletcher et al. 2018) and H2-He

(Abel et al. 2012) as well as Rayleigh scattering for all
molecules.

For the H- opacity, we used the description in
John (1988). The bound-free absorption coeﬃcient
(kbf (λ, T )) corresponds to the photo-detachment of an
electron by hydrogen ion and the free-free absorption
coeﬃcient (kf f (λ, T )) results from the interaction of
free electrons in the ﬁeld of neutral hydrogen atoms.
These coeﬃcients (in cm4 dyne−1) are expressed per
unit electron pressure and per hydrogen atom. One

chose a surface abundance of 10−2, a top abundance of
0.5 and a layer pressure change at 10−1 bar. There-
fore, the only remaining parameter to constrain the H-
absorption is the electron volume mixing ratio Ve−.

Since in emission spectroscopy the radius is degenerate
with temperature (e.g. Griﬃth 2014), we ﬁxed its value
to the best ﬁt value from the transmission retrieval.
In transmission we assumed an isothermal atmosphere
while for the emission we used a non-physically informed
approach consisting of 3 temperature points. This led
to 5 free variables: surface temperature (Tsurf ), tem-
perature of point 1 (T1), temperature of point 2 (Ttop),
pressure of point 1 (P1) and pressure of point at the top
(Ptop). These points were allowed to vary freely in the
pressure grid ranging from 10 bar to 10−10 bar. In our
retrieval analysis, we used uniform priors for all param-
eters as described in Table 6. Finally, we explored the
parameter space using the nested sampling algorithm
Multinest (Feroz et al. 2009) with 750 live points and
an evidence tolerance of 0.5.

3. RESULTS

The analysis of the transmission spectra by Tsiaras
et al. (2018) detected water along with the suggestion
of TiO and VO. Having accounted for the stellar com-
panion, the slope at the blue end of the spectrum is
reduced and thus our retrieval does not ﬁnd substan-
tial evidence of signiﬁcant abundances of TiO or VO.
However, the recovered water abundance of log(H2O)
= -2.85+0.47
−0.71 is consistent with that from Tsiaras et al.
(2018) (log(H2O) = -2.70±1.07). While we did attempt
to retrieve the carbon-based molecules, CO, CO2, and
CH4, we were unable to constrain their abundance as
they lack strong features in the G141 wavelength range.
Additionally, the abundance of e- (H- opacity) was not
constrained but we could place a 1σ upper limit of
log(FeH)<-7.3. Our best-ﬁt model favours the presence
of clouds at log(P) = 0.91 Pa but we note there is sig-
niﬁcant correlation with the abundance of water. The
best-ﬁt spectrum and the posteriors are given in Figure 5
while the priors and results from the retrieval are given
in Table 6. To understand the statistical signiﬁcance
of our results, we also ran a “molecule free” retrieval
where the only ﬁtted parameters were the planet radius,
planet temperature and cloud-top pressure. Scattering
due to Rayleigh and CIA were also included. The diﬀer-
ence in Bayesian log evidence was computed to be 24.7
in favour of the ﬁt including molecules, providing sig-
niﬁcant evidence of the detection of molecular features
(>7σ, Kass & Raftery (1995)). This is equivalent to
the Atmospheric Detectability Index (ADI) as deﬁned
in Tsiaras et al. (2018).

can calculate the electron partial pressure in dyne cm−2
(Pe−[dyne cm−2]) using:

Pe−[dyne cm−2] = P [bar] × Ve− × 106,

(1)

where P [bar] is the atmospheric pressure in bar and Ve−
is the volume mixing ratio of electrons. The weighted
cross section σH− for the H- absorption is given by:

σH−(λ, T ) = (kbf (λ, T ) + kf f (λ, T ))

× Pe−[dyne cm−2] ∗ VH ,

(2)

where VH is the volume mixing ratio of neutral hydro-
gen atoms. Hence we are left with two free parame-
ters: the electron and neutral hydrogen volume mixing
ratios. In our retrieval analysis, we ﬁxed the hydrogen
volume mixing ratio and imposed a proﬁle inspired from
Parmentier et al. (2018). We used the two-layer model
from Changeat et al. (2019) to describe the increasing
abundance of neutral hydrogen atoms with altitude. We

Our retrieval analysis of the emission spectrum of
WASP-76 b ﬁnds signiﬁcant evidence of TiO, with an
abundance of log(TiO) = -5.62+0.71
−1.57, along with H2O
at a concentration of log(H2O) = -2.81+0.51
−0.65. Addition-
ally the emission spectrum places an upper bound on
the presence of both iron hydride and vanadium oxide
at log(FeH), log(VO) ≈ -7. Again the carbon-based
molecules were not constrained since there is a lack
of spectral information in the WFC3 G141 wavelength
band. Due to the presence of optical absorbers, our
analysis suggests a temperature inversion in the dayside
of WASP-76 b. The retrieval posteriors for the emission
spectrum are shown in Figure 6 while Figure 7 displays
the best-ﬁt temperature proﬁles for both observations.
Here the model was compared to a simple blackbody
ﬁt, which converged to TBB = 2778±8 K. The diﬀer-
ence in Bayesian log evidence was 12.4, signifying the ﬁt
with H2O, TiO and a thermal inversion is statistically
preferable at >5 σ.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Comparison to Chemical Models

To provide context to our ﬁndings, we compare the
results of our retrieval analysis to a self-consistent for-
ward model computed with petitCODE, a 1D numeri-
cal iterator solving for radiative-convective and chemi-
cal equilibrium (Molli`ere et al. 2015, 2017). The code
includes radiative scattering, opacities for H2, H−, H2O,
CO, CO2, CH4, HCN, H2S, NH3, OH, C2H2, PH3, SiO,
FeH, Na, K, Fe, Fe+, Mg, Mg+, TiO and VO, as well
as collision induced absorption by H2–H2 and H2–He.
Cloud condensation of refractory species is included in
the equilibrium chemistry, but no cloud opacities are
considered in this simulation. Our petitCODE model
for WASP-76 b was computed using the stellar and plan-
etary parameters determined by West et al. (2016). An
intrinsic temperature of 600K was adopted for this in-
ﬂated planet, following the prescription by Thorngren
et al. (2019). A global planetary averaged redistribu-
tion of the irradiation was assumed.

Two models were produced: one with, and one with-
out, the presence of TiO and VO. For the former case,
the resulting temperature-pressure proﬁle and equilib-
rium abundances are shown in Figure 7. The temper-
ature proﬁle shows a inversion in the range probed by
transmission/emission spectroscopy (typically ∼ 1 mbar
to ∼ 100 mbar) and this was only present for the model
with TiO/VO opacities. A similar result is shown in
Lothringer et al. (2018), who found the same dichotomy
between atmospheres with and without TiO/VO for
planets with equilibrium temperatures of Teq = 2250
K.

Table 2. List of the retrieved parameters, their uniform
prior bounds, the scaling used and the retrieved value.

Our retrieval emission abundance for TiO (log(TiO)
= -5.62+0.71
−1.57 is consistent to 1σ with the log(TiO) ≈ -
7 predicted by petitCODE and the upper boundary of
log(FeH) < 7 that was retrieved from the emission spec-
trum also agrees well with the self-consistent petitCODE
model. In transmission, the upper limit placed on these
molecules is greater than the predicted abundances and
thus the non-detection is likely due to the quality of the
data. Furthermore, the extent of H2O in the terminator
and on the dayside is also similar to the abundance pre-
dicted with the chemical equilibrium model. Finally, the
VO chemical proﬁle is seen to be below the sensitivity
of the emission spectrum. This is due to TiO, FeH and
VO possessing similar features in the G141 waveband.
This degeneracy may also aﬀect the TiO abundance re-
trieved.

The equilibrium chemical abundances of most molecules,

except CO, drop signiﬁcantly for pressures lower than

a few mbar due to thermal dissociation in the upper
atmosphere (Lothringer et al. 2018; Parmentier et al.
2018; Arcangeli et al. 2018). Models by Parmentier
et al. (2018) suggest that, for WASP-76 b, nearly half
the water should be dissociated at the 1.4 µm photo-
sphere. Thus the H2O bands are signiﬁcantly muted due
to thermal dissociation in the upper layers of the atmo-
sphere, owing to the intense irradiation by the nearby

host star, as seen in Arcangeli et al. (2018); Lothringer
et al. (2018); Kreidberg et al. (2018). Between 1 and
1.4 µm, both water and TiO/VO opacities are low,
leading to a region where H-, TiO, and H2O opacities
have similar strength. Particularly, H- opacity ﬁlls the
gap between the two water bands at 1.1 and 1.4 µm,
eﬀectively lowering the contrast between the top and
the bottom of the bands.

as well as TiO. Inset: emission spectrum (black) with best-ﬁt model and 1-3σ uncertainties (red). Also shown is a blackbody
ﬁt (grey) which has a temperature of TBB = 2778±8 K.

From Figure 7 we also note that the quick depletion
of molecules in the atmosphere may introduce inaccu-
racies in the retrieval, as it assumes a single chemical
abundance for the whole atmospheric pressure range.
However, the chemical abundances of most molecules
remain roughly constant for the pressure range that can
be probed with our observations. Here, our isochemi-
cal retrievals suggest a thermal inversion which would

be attributed to the absorption of TiO and VO at high
altitudes. We could therefore expect the abundance of
TiO and VO to diﬀer signiﬁcantly with pressure. How-
ever, the data quality is unlikely to support a retrieval
with such complexity due to the narrow wavelength cov-
erage but such complexities will need to be accounted

comparison of the temperature-pressure proﬁles. The petitCODE model (orange) features a thermal inversion at 1 mbar, due
to absorption by TiO and VO, and closely matches the retrieved proﬁle. Top right: Molecular abundances for the petitCODE
simulation. The equilibrium fractions of most molecules (bottom) remain approximately constant for pressures higher than a few
mbar. They drop quickly at lower atmospheric pressures due to thermal dissociation. Bottom left: Comparison of constrained
molecular abundances in transmission (dotted lines) to those from the petitCODE simulation (solid lines). The water abundance
is seen to be around 1σ higher than predicted. Bottom right: Comparison of constrained molecular abundances in emission to

facilities (Changeat et al. 2019).

4.2. Previous Claims of Optical Absorbers

Optical absorbers have been proposed as one of the
leading theories as to why ultra hot Jupiters exhibit
thermal inversions (e.g. Fortney et al. 2008). Hence,
many atmospheric studies of these planets have been un-
dertaken through both transmission and emission spec-
troscopy, with some planets studied through both meth-
ods.

WASP-19 b has been studied via transmission spec-
troscopy at near-infrared wavelengths with claims con-
ﬁrming and refuting the presence of TiO. The retrievals
of the STIS G430L, G750L, WFC3 G141 and Spitzer
IRAC observations suggest the presence of water at
log(H2O) ≈ -4 but show no evidence of optical absorbers
(Sing et al. 2016; Barstow et al. 2017; Pinhas et al. 2019).
However, ground-based transits acquired with the Eu-
ropean Southern Observatorys Very Large Telescope
(VLT), using the low-resolution FORS2 spectrograph
(R∼3000) which covers the entire visible-wavelength do-
main (0.431.04 µm), suggested the presence of TiO, to

12

a conﬁdence level of 7.7σ (Sedaghati et al. 2017). How-
ever, Espinoza et al. (2019) found a featureless spectrum
and argue the results of Sedaghati et al. (2017) are likely
to be contaminated by stellar activity.

Evidence for a thermal inversion and optical absorbers
has been seen of HAT-P-7 b, which was ﬁrst studied in
emission during the commissioning program of Kepler
when the satellite detected the eclipse as part of an op-
tical phase curve (Borucki et al. 2009). This optical
eclipse measurement was combined with Spitzer pho-
tometry over 3.5-8 µm to infer the presence of a ther-
mal inversion (Christiansen et al. 2010), which was sug-
gested due to the high ﬂux ratio in the 4.5 µm chan-
nel of Spitzer compared to the 3.6 µm channel. Their
chemical equilibrium models associated these emission
features with CO, H2O and CH4. A thermal inversion
was also reported to provide the best ﬁt to these data by
the atmospheric models of Spiegel & Burrows (2010) and
Madhusudhan & Seager (2010). All three studies noted
that models without a thermal inversion could also ex-
plain the data, though only with a very high abundance
of CH4. More recently, Mansﬁeld et al. (2018) obtained
two eclipses using the HST WFC3 G141 grism. When
combined with previous observations, it was found to
be best ﬁt with a thermal inversion due to optical ab-
sorbers, but at a low statistical signiﬁcance when com-
pared to a simpler blackbody ﬁt.

Finally, some planets have been observed with both
transit and eclipse spectroscopy. For instance, stud-
ies of WASP-33 b have suggested the presence of Alu-
minium Oxide (AlO) in its transmission spectrum (von
Essen et al. 2019) while the WFC3 emission is best-ﬁt
by TiO and a thermal inversion (Haynes et al. 2015).
Other studies using WFC3 G141 that have concluded
optical absorbers may be present include WASP-121 b
by Evans et al. (2017). WASP-121 b has an equilibrium
temperature of 2500 K and H2O was detected at a 5σ
conﬁdence with indications of absorption at high alti-
tudes implying the presence of VO or TiO. The best-ﬁt
VO abundance was log(VO) = -3.5+0.4
−0.6. Subsequently,
observations of WASP-121 b with the G102 grism were
taken and combined with the original data. In this fur-
ther study, H− was included as an opacity source and the
results were not consistent with the previously recovered
VO abundance (Mikal-Evans et al. 2019). Bourrier et al.
(2019) also performed a retrieval on the combined data,
with the addition of data from TESS, and concluded VO
abundance of log(VO) = -6.03+0.50
−0.69, far lower than the
initial retrieval on WFC3 G141 data. Additionally, the
optical phase curve presented in Daylan et al. (2019)
suggested ineﬃcient heat transport. This agrees with
the work of Fortney et al. (2008), which postulated that

the presence of optical absorbers would lead to, and re-
quire, large day-night temperature contrasts. However,
Merritt et al. (2020) used high-resolution ground-based
observations to place limits on the maximum abun-
dances of TiO and VO in the terminator of WASP-121 b
to log(TiO) < -9.26 and log(VO) < -7.88. Nevertheless
the authors of this study note that these upper bounds
are degenerate with the cloud deck and scattering prop-
erties while also being limited by the accuracy of the VO
line lists. Thus, the presence of these optical absorbers
cannot be deﬁnitively ruled out as yet.

Therefore, our analysis here makes WASP-76 b only
the second ultra-hot Jupiter to be studied through both
transmission and emission spectroscopy using WFC3 in
scanning mode. In the analysis of WASP-121 b’s trans-
mission and emission spectra by Evans et al. (2018);
Mikal-Evans et al. (2019), chemical equilibrium models
were used to ﬁt the data. These suggested super-solar
metallicities of 10-30 and 5-50x solar to 1σ in transmis-
sion and emission respectively. These metallicity ranges
provide H2O abundances which are similar to those re-
covered here (10−3-10−4). The models from Parmentier
et al. (2018) suggest that, for WASP-121 b, ∼ 70% of
the H2O in the 1.4µm photosphere should be dissoci-
ated, compared to ∼ 50% in WASP-76 b. Additionally,
the metallicity (Fe/H) of WASP-76 is greater than that
of WASP-121 and both are above solar, at 0.366 and
0.12 respectively (Ehrenreich et al. 2020; Mikal-Evans
et al. 2019). We could therefore expect WASP-76 b to
have slightly more H2O than WASP-121 b but, while
the best-ﬁt solution agrees with this prediction, the 1σ
errors on the abundance are too large to be conclusive.

4.3. Further Characterisation of WASP-76 b

The atmosphere of WASP-76 b has been characterised
in a number of other works. Notably, von Essen et al.
(2020) used HST STIS to study the transmission spec-
trum of WASP-76 b. Hence, we extrapolated our best-
ﬁt model to the WFC3 data into the visible and over-
plotted the data from von Essen et al. (2020). Figure 8
shows that, in the spectral region covered STIS, our un-
certainties are very large. This is due to the wide range
of abundances that TiO, VO and FeH could take, based
on our analysis of WFC3 alone, and thus it is tempt-
ing to combine the data sets to reduce said uncertainty.
However, without overlapping wavelength coverage, this
is a dangerous pursuit at the best of times as the spectra
could be oﬀset due to the imperfect correction of instru-
ment systematics, diﬀering orbital parameters used in
the ﬁtting of the light curves, or temporal variations of
the star-planet system. In this study, we have the ad-
ditional complexity of a the third source contamination

13

tionally, ExoWebb (Edwards et al. 2020) has been used
to simulate the capability of JWST for studying this
planet. For both facilities, the predicted error bars are
far smaller than the 1σ uncertainty in the best-ﬁt spec-
trum to the Hubble WFC3 data and thus they will allow
for far tighter constraints on molecular constituents to
be imposed.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Both the transmission and emission spectra of WASP-
76 b, obtained by Hubble WFC3, have been analysed.
We have used open-source codes to reduce the data,
remove contamination from a close stellar companion,
and ﬁt the ﬁnal spectra. The transmission spectrum
exhibits a large water feature while the dayside of the
planet shows strong evidence for titanium oxide, as well
as water, and is best-ﬁt by an atmospheric thermal in-
version. The abundances retrieved closely match those
from chemical equilibrium models. However, further ob-
servations with Hubble, or future space-based facilities,
will result in a better understanding of the chemical con-
stituents of the atmosphere and help reﬁne the models
presented here.

and diﬀering methods in the removal of this stellar com-
panion. For WASP-12 b, which also suﬀered this issue,
Kreidberg et al. (2015) found the WFC3 data to be in-
compatible with that from STIS. Therefore we must, for
now, resist the temptation to amalgamate data sets from
multiple instruments. However, the addition of a transit
observation with the G102 grism would provide contin-
uous wavelength coverage from 0.3-1.7 µm, conﬁrming
the compatibility of the data and allowing the planet’s
terminator to be studied in far greater detail.

The acquisition of a secondary eclipse observation of
WASP-76 b with the G102 grism of WFC3, which would
extend the wavelength coverage into the red optical
where emission bands due to species such as TiO, VO
and FeH are more easily detectable, would further our
knowledge of this planet and be valuable in providing
additional evidence for, or refuting the presence of, TiO
and in searching for other optical absorbers.

Future space telescopes JWST (Greene et al. 2016),
Twinkle (Edwards et al. 2019) and Ariel (Tinetti et al.
2018) will provide a far wider wavelength range. These
missions will deﬁnitively move the exoplanet ﬁeld from
an era of detection into one of characterisation, allow-
ing for the identiﬁcation of the molecular species present
and their chemical proﬁle, insights into the atmospheric
temperature proﬁle and the detection and characterisa-
tion of clouds. Ariel, the ESA M4 mission due for launch
in 2028, will conduct a survey of ∼1000 planets to an-
swer the question: how chemically diverse are the atmo-
spheres of exoplanets? WASP-76 b is an excellent target
for study with Ariel (Edwards et al. 2019), through both
transmission and emission spectroscopy, and simulated
error bars from Mugnai et al. (2020) have been added to
the best-ﬁt spectra to showcase this in Figure 9. Addi-
