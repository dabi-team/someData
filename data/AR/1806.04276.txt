ABSTRACT
From integral ﬁeld data we extract the optical spectra of 20 shocked clouds in the supernova remnant
N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Using self-consistent shock modelling, we derive the
shock velocity, pre-shock cloud density and shock ram pressure in these clouds. We show that the [Fe
X] and [Fe XIV] emission arises in faster, partially radiative shocks moving through the lower density
gas near the periphery of the clouds. In these shocks dust has been eﬀectively destroyed, while in the
slower cloud shocks the dust destruction is incomplete until the recombination zone of the shock has
been reached. These dense interstellar clouds provide a sampling of the general interstellar medium
(ISM) of the LMC. Our shock analysis allows us to make a new determination of the ISM chemical
composition in N, O, Ne, S, Cl and Ar, and to obtain accurate estimates of the fraction of refractory
grains destroyed. From the derived cloud shock parameters, we estimate cloud masses and show that
the clouds previously existed as typical self-gravitating Bonnor-Ebert spheres into which converging
cloud shocks are now being driven.

1. INTRODUCTION
The supernova remnant (SNR) N132D in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the brightest X-ray emitting
SNR in this galaxy (Hwang et al. 1993; Favata et al.
1997; Hughes et al. 1998; Borkowski et al. 2007; Xiao
& Chen 2008). Located within the stellar bar of the
LMC, N132D was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a SNR by Wester-
lund & Mathewson (1966) on the basis of the association
of a non-thermal radio source with a [S II]– bright op-
tical structure. Danziger & Dennefeld (1976) discovered
high-velocity [O III] and [Ne III] material ejected in the
supernova explosion, which established N132D as a rela-
tively young SNR in which the reverse shock has not yet
reached the centre of the remnant, marking the formal
transition to the Sedov phase of evolution. This would
imply that the swept-up interstellar medium (ISM) is
less than a few times the mass ejected in the supernova
event, a result which is in apparent contradiction to the
swept-up mass derived from X-ray observations (Hughes
et al. 1998). From the dynamics of the fast-moving O
and Ne material, Danziger & Dennefeld (1976) derived
a maximum age of 3440 yr for the SNR, and a probable
age of ∼ 1350 yr. Subsequent analyses gave similar ages;
2350 yr (Lasker 1980), and 2500 yr (Vogt & Dopita 2011).

Although most optical studies have concentrated on
the fast-moving O- and Ne-rich ejecta (Lasker 1980; Blair
et al. 2000; Vogt & Dopita 2011), there are a number
of luminous, dense shock clouds with apparently ‘nor-
mal’ interstellar composition and ∼ 200 km/s velocity
dispersion. The most prominent of these is the so-called
Lasker’s Bowl structure in the northern part of the rem-
nant, but HST imaging (Blair et al. 2000) reveals many
other small complexes of shocked cloudlets. These clouds
do not show appreciable enhancements in the strength of
the [N II] lines, and are thought to be simply ISM clouds
over which the SNR blast wave has recently swept. In
this paper we follow the study of N49 by Dopita et al.
(2016) in investigating the degree of dust destruction in
these cloud shocks. We also derive the physical param-
eters for some 20 diﬀerent shocked ISM cloudlets and
estimate their chemical abundances.

2. OBSERVATIONS & DATA REDUCTION
The integral ﬁeld spectra of N132D were obtained be-
tween 16 Nov 2017 and 24 Nov 2017 using the Wide Field
Spectrograph (WiFeS) (Dopita et al. 2007, 2010), an in-
tegral ﬁeld spectrograph mounted on the 2.3-m ANU
telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. This instrument
delivers a ﬁeld of view of 25(cid:48)(cid:48)× 38(cid:48)(cid:48)at a spatial resolu-
tion of either 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)× 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) or 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)× 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48), depending on
the binning on the CCD. In these observations, we op-
erated in the binned 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)x 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) mode. The data were
obtained in the low resolution mode R ∼ 3000 (FWHM
of ∼ 100 km/s) using the B3000 & R3000 gratings in each
arm of the spectrograph, with the RT560 dichroic which
provides a transition between the two arms at around
560nm. For details on the various instrument observing
modes, see Dopita et al. (2007).

All observations are made at PA=0, giving a long axis
in the N-S direction. The basic grid consists of 15 point-
ings in an overlapping 3 × 5 grid (E-W:N-S), followed by

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Dopita et al.

7 pointings centered on the overlap regions of the base
3×5 grid, with an additional pointing in the SE to probe
the extent of the photoionised precursor region around
N132D. The eighth overlap position was not observed due
to deteriorating weather conditions. The typical seeing
over the course of the observations was 1.5 arc sec. and
ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 arc sec. over the individual expo-
sures. Each region was observed with 2×1000 s exposure
time giving a total integration time on target of 44000s.
We used blind oﬀsets from a reference star to move to
each ﬁeld of the mosaic consistently over the course of
the observing run, and avoid any gaps in the resulting
mosaic. A fault in the oﬀset guide head gave rise to er-
rors of (cid:46) 5 arc sec.
in the pointing of the ﬁelds; small
enough not to result in any gaps within the mosaic.

The wavelength scale is calibrated using a series of Ne-
Ar arc lamp exposures, taken throughout the night. Arc
exposure times are 50s for the B3000 grating and 1s for
the R3000 grating. Flux calibration was performed using
the STIS spectrophotometric standard stars HD 009051,
HD 031128 and HD 075000 8.
In addition, a B-type
telluric standard HIP 8352 was observed to better cor-
rect for the OH and H2O telluric absorption features in
the red. The separation of these features by molecu-
lar species allows for a more accurate telluric correction
by accounting for night to night variations in the column
density of these two species. All data cubes were reduced
using the PyWiFeS 9 data reduction pipeline (Childress
et al. 2014b,a).

All

the individual,

reduced cubes were median-
averaged into a red and blue mosaic using a custom
python script. The WCS solution of both mosaics is set
by cross-matching their individual (collapsed) white-light
images with all entries in the Gaia (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2016a) DR1 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016b); see
Fig 1). For simplicity, and given the spaxel size of the
WiFeS datacubes, we restrict ourselves to integer shifts
when combining ﬁelds. We estimate that the resulting
absolute and relative (ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld) alignment accuracy
are both ±1 arc sec.

2.1. HST imaging of the cloudlets
We have downloaded all the HST ACS F475W and
F658N images from the Barbara A. Mikulski archive for
space telescopes (MAST). The former ﬁlter encompasses
the full velocity range of the [O III] λλ5959,5007˚A emis-
sion, whereas the latter covers the rest-frame Hα emis-
sion. The dataset comprises four exposures of 380 s each
with the F475W ﬁlter, and four exposures of 360 s each
using the F658N ﬁlter, all acquired in January 2004 un-
der program #12001 (PI Green).

We used the individual calibrated and CTE-corrected
frames (* flc.fits) retrieved from MAST to construct
a combined, drizzled image in both ﬁlters using the fol-
lowing steps. We ﬁrst correct the WCS solutions of
each frame using the tweakreg routine from the driz-
zlepac 2.1.13 package via a dedicated python script.
We anchor the WCS solution to the Gaia (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016a) DR1 (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016b) sources present within the images, retrieved au-

tomatically via the astroquery module. The WCS-
corrected images are then merged using the astrodriz-
zle routine, with a pixel scale set to 0.04 arcsec for both
ﬁlters (for simplicity).

2.2. Spectral Extraction
The spectra of 20 prominent shocked ISM clouds were
extracted from the global WiFeS mosaic datacubes us-
ing using QFitsView v3.1 rev.74110. The positions of
the clouds were chosen so as to largely avoid contami-
nation by high-velocity [O III] – emitting material, see
Fig 2. The exception is P07, but the velocity shift of the
high velocity material here is suﬃcient as to allow accu-
rate determinations of the narrow-line ﬂuxes. We used
a circular extraction aperture with a radius of either 2
or 3 arc sec. to best match the size of the bright region.
To remove the residual night sky emission and (approx-
imately) the faint stellar contribution, we subtracted a
mean sky reference annulus 1 arc sec. wide surrounding
the extraction aperture. The extraction regions were op-
timised by peaking up the signal in Hα in the red data
cube, and in Hγ in the blue data cube, respectively. This
procedure may lead to some contamination by the faint

extended cloud emission in the case of P07, P08, P14,
P15, P18 and P20 (see Figure 3). However, the core re-
gion strongly dominates such fainter contributions. The
positions of the extracted spectra, the extraction radius
used, the measured mean radial velocity, and the Hα
velocity width (FWHM) (after correction for the instru-
mental resolution) of each cloud are listed in Table 1, and
the corresponding positions are shown on the HST ACS
Hα + [O III] image in Figure 2 and each cloud with
its spectral extraction region is shown in an 8 × 8 arc
sec. postage stamp image in Figure 3. A spectrum of
the bright cloudlet P14 is shown in Figure 4 to indicate
the quality of the data. Note that the typical veloc-
ity FWHM of these clouds in only ∼ 180 km/s, which

is fairly indicative of the mean shock velocity in those
clouds (Fig.6 in Dopita et al. 2012).

The mean Heliocentric radial velocity of all 20 clouds
is +246 km/s, and the mean Heliocentric radial veloc-
ity of the photoionised halo of N132D is found to be
+261 km/s, a diﬀerence which lies within the expected
statistical error caused by sampling of the cloud shock
velocities projected along the lines of sight within the
random cloud positions inside the SNR. These ﬁgures
can be compared to the +264.6 km/s (Smith & Weedman
1971), +262±16 km/s (Danziger & Dennefeld 1976), and
+259 km/s (Feast 1964) for N127, a nearby HII region.
Since most of the Hα emission arises in the recom-
bination zone of the cloud shocks, we can estimate a

lower limit for the cloud shock velocities, vs, from the
most extreme diﬀerences in the measured radial velocity
of the cloud from the mean Heliocentric radial velocity
of the photoionised halo of N132D. These are +173 km/s
for cloud P04, and -143 km/s for cloud P19. Thus we
have vs (cid:38) 160 km/s, in good agreement with the esti-
mate based on the FWHM of the Hα line proﬁles.

2.3. Measuring Emission Line Fluxes
For each extracted spectrum, the spectra were ﬁrst re-
duced to rest wavelength based on their measured ra-
dial velocities listed in Table 1, and then emission-line
in units of erg/cm2/s, their uncertainties, the
ﬂuxes
(in ˚A) and the continuum lev-
emission line FWHMs
els were measured using the interactive routines in Graf

lines, detectable atmospheric absorption, and underlying stellar

Hβ and their uncertainties along with the absolute Hβ
ﬂuxes in units of erg/cm2/s, are given for each of the
clouds in Tables A1 – A4 in the Appendix.

3. EMISSION LINE DIAGNOSTICS
3.1. Self-Consistent Shock Modelling
To analyse the spectrophotometry we have built a fam-
ily of radiative shocks with self-consistent pre-ionisation
using the MAPPINGS 5.12 code, following the method-
ology described in Sutherland & Dopita (2017), and ap-
plied to the study of Herbig-Haro objects by Dopita
& Sutherland (2017). The pre-shock density is set by
the ram pressure of the shock, taken to be indepen-
dent of shock velocity; Pram = 1.5 × 10−7 dynes cm−2,
to ensure that the measured [S II] densities (which give
the electron density near the recombination zone of the
shock) approximately match those produced by the mod-
els. For each abundance set, a set of models was run for
100 (cid:54) vs (cid:54) 475 km/s in steps of 25 km/s. The mag-
netic ﬁeld pressure in the un-shocked cloud ahead of the
photo-ionised precursor is assumed to be in equipartition
with the gas pressure, Pmag = Pgas, and the tempera-
ture of the gas entering the shock is given by the self-
consistent pre-ionisation computation; see Sutherland &
Dopita (2017) for details.

The abundance set was initially taken as being 0.5
times the Local Galactic Concordance (LGC) values
(Nicholls et al. 2017), but was then iterated manually to
achieve a better ﬁt of theory to the spectra of the clouds
on the standard Baldwin et al. (1981) and Veilleux &
Osterbrock (1987) diagnostic diagrams. The depletion
factors of the heavy elements caused by the condensa-
tion of these elements onto dust are deﬁned as the ratio
of the gas phase abundance to the total element abun-
dance. The depletion factors are derived from the formu-
lae of Jenkins (2009), extended to the other elements on
the basis of their condensation temperatures and/or their
position on the periodic table.
In these shock models,
following Dopita et al. (2016) we have investigated the
eﬀect of changing the logarithmic Fe depletion, log DFe
in the range 0.0 > log [DFe] > −1.0.

The abundance set adopted for the theoretical grid at
the various values of log DFe is given in Table 2. The
abundances of C, Mg, and Si are not constrained by our
observations and for these we ﬁx the abundances at half
of the LGC values. We produce a more reﬁned estimate
of the LMC chemical abundances when we build detailed
models for the brightest clouds, below.

The line intensities and line ratios given in this paper
comprise the sum of the radiative shock and its pho-
toionised precursor.
In the case of the fastest shock,
the extent of the photoionised precursor region and/or
the cooling length of the shock may exceed the physical
extent of the pre-shocked cloud.
In Figure 5 we show
the cooling length of the shock to 1000K, the depth of
the photoionised precursor to the point where hydrogen
is only 1% ionised, and the fraction of the shock Hβ
emission which arises from the precursor. The cooling

length scales inversely as the ram pressure, and the pre-
cursor length remains approximately constant. At the
distance of the LMC 0.1 pc corresponds to 0.45 arc sec.

3.2. Shock Velocity Diagnostics
Here we investigate potentially useful diagnostics of
the shock velocity using emission line ratios. To avoid is-
sues of chemical abundance diﬀerence, the line ratio used
should involve diﬀerent levels of the same ion, or else dif-

brock (1987) diagnostic diagrams (hereafter BPT Dia-
grams), is indicative of the mode of excitation. However,
they are not really useful as diagnostics of the detailed
shock conditions. This is demonstrated in Figure 7. It
should be noted that the range in observed line ratio and
in the theoretical grid is very small on these diagrams,
compared with the range covered by either HII regions
or active galaxies and Narrow Line Regions. All these di-
agrams serve to show is that the theoretical models and
the observations show a satisfactory overlap.

This said, a few points on these diagrams are worthy of
further mention. First P13 is the only region which shows
an excess in the line intensity of [N II], which may be
indicative of pre-supernova mass-loss enrichment. How-
ever, this seems a little unlikey as the region is close to
the boundary of the SNR shell. Second, P20 shows ex-
tremely strong [O III] emission. This is evidenced by
the blue appearance of this region in Figure 3. This re-
gion will be discussed in more detail below, where we
show that it is due to a ﬁnite-age shock in which the gas
has not had time to become fully radiative. Lastly, P08
shows particularly weak [O III] emission. This region,
also discussed below, lies in a complex of Balmer domi-
nated or non-radiative ﬁlaments in which a high velocity
non-radiative shock is passing through an un-ionised or
partially-ionised precursor medium.

3.4.

[Fe II], [Fe III] and [Fe VII] diagnostics

As can be seen from Tables A1 - A4 the [Fe II] spec-
trum is very rich. For the purposes of analysis, we have
selected the brightest of these lines, [Fe II]λ5158 and
[Fe II]λ8617. In Figure 8 we present the observed points
superimposed on our theoretical shock model grid. From
this, it is immediately apparent that nowhere does the
measured iron depletion factor; log DFe exceed -0.5. In-
deed many of the points are consistent with no depletion
at all.

ferent ions of the same element. In Dopita et al. (2016),
we already noted that the [O III] λλ4363/5007 ratio was
a useful indicator of shock velocity. This is because the
[O III] temperature in the cooling zone of the shock is
high at low shock velocities (faster than ∼ 85 km/s, when
this ion is ﬁrst produced in the cooling zone of the shock),
reaching a maximum at vs ∼ 140 km/s when O III starts
to become ionised to higher ionisation stages. As the
velocity increases further, O III is ionised to O IV, and
the [O III] emission becomes conﬁned to the cooler re-
gion nearer the recombination zone of the shock. At still
higher velocities, a O III zone photoionised by EUV pho-
tons generated in the cooling zone of the shock develops
adjacent to the recombination zone. This has still lower
mean temperature; Te (cid:46) 104 K. For these physical rea-
sons, the [O III] temperature is more or less a decreasing
function of shock velocity, and is relatively insensitive to
log DFe. This behaviour is shown in Figure 6.

A second diagnostic is the excitation of He, as mea-
sured by the He II/He I λλ4686/5876 ratio. This is
shown in the second panel of Figure 6. Below vs ∼
200 km/s, this ratio is determined by the pre-ionisation
of the shock, and the temperature structure of the post-
shock region, and is multi-valued. However, above this
velocity, it provides a useful diagnostic, albeit somewhat
sensitive to log DFe. This sensitivity is caused by changes
in the cooling length with gas-phase Fe abundance, which
changes the ionisation structure of He in the shock. In
what follows, we will use both the He and [O III] di-
agnostic ratios as spectroscopic indicators of the shock
velocity.

Furthermore, it is clear that the indicated shock veloc-
ities in general exceed 200 km/s. Thus for most of these
the [O III] line ratio can be used to estimate the shock
velocity. However, a number of the points lie in the am-
biguous region of the He II/He I line ratio velocity diag-
nostic. To the extent to which it is possible, both shock
velocities and log DFe have been estimated for each cloud
from these diagnostic diagrams. The results are given in
Tables 3 and 4. We ﬁnd a mean shock velocity (cid:104)vs(cid:105) of
240 km/s, and (cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.15. This result agrees very

standard shock grid, as presented in the previous ﬁgures clearly
fails to reproduce the positions of the observed points on these di-
agnostic diagrams. However, by adding a faster, partially radiative
shock of age ∼ 600 yr, which covers an area of 3-10 times the area
of the dense cloud shock, we can achieve a satisfactory ﬁt with
the observations (upper two curves marked 600yr, 3xA and 600yr,
10xA, respectively).

closely with the (cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.16 ± 0.07 found by Do-
pita et al. (2016) in N49, another bright LMC SNR, and
shows that dust has been largely destroyed by the time
the recombination zone of the shock has been reached.

A similar analysis was applied to the [Fe III]λ5270/Hβ
and [Fe III]λ4881/Hβ line ratios. This is shown in Fig-
ure 9. The two lines agree less well with each other, the
[Fe III]λ4881/Hβ ratio tending to produce a larger de-
pletion factor. In each line ratio, a much wider range of
depletion factors is observed, from -0.25 to ∼ −1.25. Av-
eraging all measurements, we obtain (cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.74±
0.25. This result is also broadly consistent with what was
derived in the case of N49; (cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.956 ± 0.15
(Dopita et al. 2016).

Finally, the analysis for [Fe VII]λ6087/Hα is shown
in Figure 11. Note that this line requires shock veloci-
ties of vs > 180 km/s in order to be produced with ap-
preciable strength in the radiative shock. Here, the in-
ferred depletion factors range from -0.0 to ∼ −0.75 with
(cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.4.

Given the intrinsic uncertainties in the atomic data
for the forbidden lines of Fe, we can conclude that the
[Fe III] and the [Fe VII] lines imply a mean depletion
factor of order (cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.6 ± 0.25, while the [Fe II]
lines give a depletion factor (cid:104)log DFe(cid:105) = −0.15 ± 0.15.
Thus, in both of these N132D and in N49, we ﬁnd that
Fe-bearing dust grains are not fully destroyed until they
reach the recombination zone of the shock. The detail
of the grain destruction process were discussed in Dopita
et al. (2016), where it was concluded that this type of
depletion pattern supports the grain destruction model
of Seab & Shull (1983) and Borkowski & Dwek (1995).

3.5.

[Ni II] diagnostics

Since we also observe strong [Ni II]λ7378, it is worth
asking whether the Ni-containing grains suﬀer the same
fate as the Fe-containing grains. The diagnostic plots for
[Ni II]/Hα are given in Figure 10. We ﬁnd a depletion
factor of ∼ −0.4, intermediate between the [Fe III] and
[Fe III] results, but again consistent with a large fraction

of dust grains being destroyed in the shock.

3.6. The highly ionised species of Fe

To produce

the highly ionised species of Fe;
[Fe IX]λ8235, [Fe X]λ6374 and [Fe XIV]λ5303 requires
shock velocities vs (cid:38) 200 km/s.
Indeed, the self-
consistent radiative shock models do not produce strong
[Fe X]λ6374 until vs ∼ 250 km/s and [Fe XIV]λ5303 be-
comes bright only for vs > 350 km/s. The diagnostics of
expansion velocity, velocity dispersion, and the spectral
diagnostics presented above all point to shock velocities
for typical clouds in the range 160 km/s< vs < 300 km/s.
Thus it is clear that the relatively strong [Fe X] and
[Fe XIV] lines observed must arise in another region with
higher shock velocity.

This is not unexpected, given the appearance of the
clouds on the HST images, which often show a bright
core in Hα, surrounded by fainter ﬁlamentary structures.
We can identify these regions with the bright radiative
shocks being driven into the denser cores of these clouds,
and a faster, but only partially-radiative shock driven
by a similar external ram-pressure sweeping through the
less dense outer regions of the same clouds. Indeed in the
case of another SNR in the LMC; N49, both the spatial
and dynamical distinction between the [Fe XIV]λ5303
and the [Fe II]λ5159 emission are very marked (cf. Fig.3
in Dopita et al. 2016).

The detailed diagnostic diagrams for these two Fe
species are shown in Figure 12. For the standard grid,
both fail to reproduce the observed strength of the lines,
but the [Fe XIV]
Introducing a
partially-radiative shock leads to a dramatic improve-
ment. The derivation of the plausible shock parameters
for these shocks is as follows.

is particularly bad.

First, we note that the mean cloud shock ram pressure
derived from the observations (see Section 4, below) is
Pram = 3.3 × 10−7 dynes/cm2. At the mean pre-shock
particle density implied for these shocks, n0 ∼ 240 cm−3,
the mean cooling age to Te = 1000 K is 400 yr. This
provides an initial estimate of the shock age. Another
way is to take the age of the SNR as estimated from the
[O III] dynamics of the fast-moving material and estimate
from the position of the cloud within the SNR how long
it has been since the blast wave overran the cloud. In
Section 1 we saw that estimates of the age of N132D vary
from 1350 – 3440 yr for the SNR, with a probable age
of ∼ 2500 yr (Danziger & Dennefeld 1976; Lasker 1980;
Vogt & Dopita 2011). The detailed position of the clouds
within the SNR blast wave cannot be reliably estimated
from their projected distances from the boundary of the
shell, but we will take this as being ∼ 25%, as an upper
limit, giving a mean shock age of (cid:46) 600 yr.

With the shock ram pressure given above, the mean
pre-shock density at a given shock velocity is fully deter-
mined; for shock velocities of 300, 350 and 400 km/s the
pre-shock particle densities are 160, 117 and 90 cm−3,
respectively. None of these shocks can become fully ra-
diative within this timescale. In the 600 yr available, the
300 km/s shock cools from Te = 1.27 × 106 K to Te =
6.06 × 105 K; the 350 km/s shock from Te = 1.72 × 106 K
to Te = 1.43 × 106 K and the 400 km/s shock from
Te = 2.25 × 106 K to Te = 2.07 × 106 K.

The optical spectra of these shocks only contain emis-

model grid at the same shock velocity, we can estimate
the pre-shock particle density, n0, and the ram pressure
driving the shock; Pram. These are listed in Table 5. For
the speciﬁc regions P08 and P09, the errors in the es-
timated shock velocities are great, as are the errors in
n0. The region P20 is an incompletely radiative shock
so therefore the measured [S II] electron density repre-
sents an under-estimate of the true density in the [S II]
recombination zone.

In the ﬁnal column of Table 5 we give the time required
for the post-shock plasma to cool to 1000 K, t1000K mea-
sured in years. At this point, the optical forbidden lines
are no longer emitted in the plasma, and hydrogen is
less than 2% ionised, so the shock is essentially fully ra-
diative. We may conclude that these cloud shocks are
somewhat older than (cid:104)t1000K(cid:105) = 410 yr (excluding P20).
The mean ram pressure for the clouds, Pram = 3.1 ×
10−7 dynes/cm2 is much higher than the mean pressure
in the X-ray plasma. This may be estimated using
the proton densities and electron temperatures listed in
Williams et al. (2006). This gives 7.6 × 10−8 dynes cm−2
in the NW region, and 5.3 × 10−8 dynes cm−2 in the S,
for an average of 6.4 × 10−8 dynes cm−2. Thus the ram
pressure in the cloud shocks is typically ∼ 5 times higher
than in the surrounding X-ray plasma. The reason for
this diﬀerence is discussed in Section 5, below.

The mean pre-shock density inferred for these clouds is
surprisingly high; (cid:104)n0(cid:105) = 243 cm−3 (excluding P08, P09
and P20). However, the pressure in the ISM of the LMC
has been estimated using the excited C I emission along a
number of sight lines by Welty et al. (2016). This analysis
gave (cid:104)log P/k(cid:105) = 4.02 cm−3K. If the N132D clouds were
characterised by the same ISM pressure before they were
engulfed by the supernova shock wave (which is not at
all a certain assumption), then their equilibrium temper-
ature would have been ∼ 40 K, and they can be therefore
considered to be part of the cold neutral medium phase
of the ISM.

4.2. Chemical Abundances & Depletion Factors
We selected the four brightest clouds; P12, P14, P15
and P18 for detailed study, with the aim of deriving
more precise shock parameters, and to derive the chem-
ical abundances of the elements in the ISM of the LMC
through high-precision shock modelling.

In order to measure the goodness of ﬁt of any particular

seek to minimise the L1-norm for the ﬁt. That is to say

This procedure weights fainter lines equally with
stronger lines, and is therefore more sensitive to the val-
ues of the input parameters. We simultaneously ﬁt to
those emission lines which are most sensitive to the con-
trolling parameters of shock velocity and ram pressure;

the [N I], [N II], and [S II] lines. In addition, we estimate

sion lines of hydrogen and helium, as well as lines of coro-
nal species of S, Si, Ar, Fe and Ni. The 300 km/s shock
is too slow to reproduce the observed [Fe XIV]/[Fe X]
ratio, while the 400 km/s overproduces [Fe XIV] rela-
tive to [Fe X], and is somewhat too faint relative to the
cloud shock and its precursor. The curves on Figure 12
are presented for the 350 km/s shock. In this ﬁgure, we
added the contribution of the fast shock to that of the
cloud shock, assuming that the fast shock covers an area
of either 3 times, or 10 times that of the cloud shock.
We assume that dust has been fully destroyed by shat-
tering and sputtering in these fast shocks. Adding this
fast shock contribution, we now achieve a satisfactory ﬁt
with the observational diagnostics for both [Fe X] and
[Fe XIV].

The WiFeS images of N132D support the hypothesis
that the faster [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] - emitting shocks cover
a greater area than the cloud shocks which are bright
in Hα. This is shown in Figure 13, in which we have
constructed an image in Hα (red), [Fe X] (green) and
[Fe XIV] (blue). In this image the clouds show up as red
or mauve blobs, while the [Fe XIV] emission forms diﬀuse
halos about these clouds, and is much more extensive.
In general, the [Fe XIV] emission is much more closely
spatially correlated with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory
images (Borkowski et al. 2007), an eﬀect which is also
seen in both N49 in the LMC (Dopita et al. 2016) and in
the SMC SNR; 1E 0102.2-7219 (Vogt et al. 2017).

4. DETAILED CLOUD SHOCK MODELLING
4.1. Cloud Shock Parameters
From the generalised shock diagnostic diagrams, we

the individual shocked ISM clouds in N132D. First, us-
ing the shock velocities estimated from both the [O III]
and He II/He I diagnostic diagrams, the measured [S II]
electron densities given by the [S II] λλ6731/6717 ratios,
and the mean [S II] electron densities given from the

the gas-phase heavy element abundances using the bright
[Fe V] 4227˚A [Fe VII] 6087˚A
[Fe II] and [Fe III] lines,
[Ni II] 7378˚A Mg I] 4561˚A, Ca II 3933˚A and [Ca II] 7291˚A
lines. We assume that the more excited species of Fe are
depleted in the gas phase by the same amount as Fe III.
For the reason given above we do not attempt to ﬁt ei-
ther the [Fe X] 6374˚A or the [Fe XIV] 5303 ˚A lines, given
that they arise in a separate phase of the ISM. Other
elements such as Ne, Ar and Cl are ﬁt using the [Ne III]
3969˚A [Ar III] 7136˚A and [Cl II] 8579˚A lines.

Our models simultaneously optimise the ﬁt to 40 emis-
sion lines, and we manually iterate shock velocity, ram
pressure and chemical abundances until the ﬁt is opti-
mised. The results for these four clouds are shown in
Table 6. The L1-norm provides a good estimate for the
error on the abundance of those elements ﬁtted with only
one or two emission lines. For O, N and S the accuracy
is higher. In Table 2, we have adopted the abundances
of Mg, Ca, Fe and Ni from Russell & Dopita (1992) in
order to estimate the depletion factors of these elements.
The best ﬁt was achieved without the inclusion of the
precursor emission, which in principle could account for
as much as 25% of the total emission. There are two
possible reasons for this. First, the ﬁnite extent of the
cloud may limit the length of the precursor, which is max-
imised in our plane-parallel models. Second, the local
curvature of the shock front may allow signiﬁcant escape
of the upstream ionising UV photons. This is suggested
by the fact that our models of these four clouds system-
atically overestimate the He IIλ4686/ He Iλ5876 ratio,
which suggests that the incoming plasma is over-ionised
by the computed precursor radiation ﬁeld given by the
model.

The derived depletion factors for Mg given in Table 6
are likely to have very large, and unquantiﬁable errors

attached to them. There is only one Mg line detected,
and it is produced by neutral Mg in the tail of the re-
combination zone of the shock. Given the low ionisation
potential of this species (7.64 eV), the Mg I] line strength
will be highly dependent on the unknown stellar UV radi-
ation ﬁeld, which by ionising this species would depress
the line strength and lead to a larger depletion factor
being inferred.

For the remaining elements we derive the following
mean LMC interstellar abundances, 12 + log([X/H]), of
He: 10.86 ± 0.05, N: 7.12 ± 0.07, O: 8.31 ± 0.04, Ne:
7.44 ± 0.08, S: 7.01 ± 0.06, Cl: 4.66 ± 0.11 and Ar:
5.78 ± 0.11. These abundances are generally similar to
those obtained in our detailed shock ﬁtting of the super-
nova remnant N49 (Dopita et al. 2016); He: 10.92, N:
7.10, O: 8.46, Ne: 7.79, S: 7.05, Cl: 5.2 and Ar: 6.1.

These abundances should also be compared with those
from Russell & Dopita (1992): He: 10.94 ± 0.03, N:
7.14 ± 0.15, O: 8.35 ± 0.06, Ne: 7.61 ± 0.05, S: 6.70 ± 0.09,
Cl: 4.76 ± 0.08 and Ar: 6.29 ± 0.25. Given the diﬀerences
in the methodology used to derive these, and the changes
in key atomic input parameters over the years, the agree-
ment between these two is as good as could be expected.
No systematic diﬀerence is seen for the elements most
important in the modelling; N and O, but the derived
He, Ne, S, Cl and Ar abundances are only marginally
consistent with each other. What is now required is a re-
derivation of the abundances using H II regions and the
same modelling code to compare with the SNR-derived
abundances.

The derived abundances can also be compared to more
recent determinations from stellar observations. Korn
et al. (2005) gave an new analysis of a slow-rotating B
star in NGC 2002 which gave N: 6.99 ± 0.2, O: 8.29 ± 0.2,
and Mg: 7.44 ± 0.2. These values diﬀered very little from

Shocked Clouds in N132D

11

his earlier work (Korn et al. 2002).

With respect to the refractory elements, Korn et al.
(2000) derived appreciably lower Mg and Fe abundances
than Russell & Dopita (1992); Mg: 6.96 ± 0.22 and Fe:
7.09 ± 0.15. Using these values, our results are consis-
tent with full destruction of the Fe-bearing grains in the
[Fe II]–emitting zone, and the estimated Mg depletion
factor is lowered to only log DMgII = −0.38. However,
the later Korn et al. (2002) paper gave Mg: 7.37 ± 0.06
and Fe: 7.33 ± 0.0.03, which is in much closer agreement
with the Russell & Dopita (1992) estimates.

In conclusion, we can be fairly conﬁdent of the LMC
He, N and O abundances; He: 10.92 ± 0.04, N: 7.12 ±
0.09 and O: 8.32 ± 0.06. For the other non-refractory
elements the recommended values are Ne: 7.52 ± 0.09, S:
7.00 ± 0.15, Cl: 4.70 ± 0.08 and Ar: 5.78 ± 0.25.

Our results are consistent with nearly full destruction
of the Fe–containing grains in these 210–260 km/s shocks,
but the Mg–containing grains appear to be only partially
destroyed. This argues for a diﬀerent carrier for the two
metals, possibly iron(II) oxide (FeO) for iron and the
magnesium silicates, forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite
(MgSiO3) in the case of Mg.

The destruction of Fe–containing grains appears to
have proceeded to a greater extent in N132D than in
N49 (Dopita et al. 2016). Although the estimated shock
velocities are similar (210–260 km/s in N132D and 200–
250 km/s in N49), the higher ram pressures and higher
pre-shock densities in N132D (160–410 cm−3) compared
with N49 (∼ 80 cm−3) has facilitated this greater frac-
tional dust destruction.

In both N49 and in N132D, the grain destruction in
the faster, partially-radiative shocks producing [Fe X]
and [Fe XIV] emission is much more advanced. In both
these SNR, the shock velocity in these highly-ionised
zones is ∼ 350 km/s. Thus, thermal sputtering and
non-thermal sputtering due to the high relative veloc-
ity of the dust grains relative to the hot-post shock
plasma (Barlow 1978; McKee et al. 1987; Seab 1987;
Jones et al. 1994) dominates the grain destruction in
these fast shocks, while gyro-acceleration (aka betatron
acceleration) caused by the compression of the magnetic
ﬁeld in the cooling zone of the shock resulting in grain
shattering and vaporisation (Spitzer 1976; Borkowski &
Dwek 1995) appears to dominate as the grain destruction
process in the slower, denser shocks.

4.3. The partially-radiative region P20
We already noted in Section 3 that region P20 has
anomalously strong [O III] emission – see Figure 7. Fur-
thermore, the [S II] lines indicate a low density compared
with the other regions which produces the low value of
the ram pressure given in Table 5. All of these point
to a shock which has not yet become fully radiative. In
this case, it appears that the photoionised precursor is
brighter in the optical lines than the shock itself. The
extremely strong [O III] would arise in this precursor.

The observed spectrum of this region proved very dif-
ﬁcult to model. Our “best” model has a relatively
poor ﬁt, with an L1-norm of 0.21. This model has a
∼ 400 yr old shock with vs = 300 km/s moving into
a medium with a pre-shock H density n0 = 235 cm−3.
In this shock the plasma cools from an initial temper-

Fig. 14.— The region P08 as seen by HST in Hα (top panel) and
in [S II] (lower panel). The WiFeS extraction aperture is shown
as a black circle, and the resultant spectrum around Hα is shown
in the inset. The Flux units are the same as in Figure 4. Note
the broad wings of Hα extending out to ±900 km/s. This broad
emission is presumably originating from the ﬁlaments which are
marked with red arrows on the images.

ature of Te = 1.2 × 106 K to a ﬁnal temperature of
Te = 8.2 × 105 K. The precursor material is assumed to
have no dust destruction with log DF e = −1.00, and the
density of the pre-shock gas n0 = 235 cm−3, and is illumi-
nated by the UV radiation ﬁeld of the partially-radiative
shock in plane-parallel one-sided geometry. This gives a
precursor thickness of ∼ 0.12 pc (at the point where H is
50% ionised). For this conﬁguration, the shock produces
only 4.5% of the total Hβ luminosity. Table 7 provides
comparison of the key emission lines predicted by the
model, compared with the observations.

Note the extreme discrepancy in the predicted strength
of the [O III] λ4363 line. From the model, the predicted
temperature in the O III zone is Te = 13600 K, while the
data suggest an electron temperature of Te ∼ 49000 K
in this zone. Similar, but smaller, temperature discrep-
ancies are suggested for the O II and N II zones. This
requires another form of heating in the precursor such
as electron conduction, cosmic ray heating or else ioni-

sation by the general EUV radiation ﬁeld of the nebula.
Apart from these temperature discrepancies, the [S II]
λλ6731/6717 ratio also requires a higher electron den-
sity; n[SII] ∼ 760 cm−3.

4.4. The Balmer-Dominated Shocks in P08
We noted above that the region P08 also displays an
anomalous spectrum, deﬁcient in the forbidden lines with
respect to the Balmer lines, with the [O III] lines being
particularly weak – see Figure 7. The cause of this ap-
pears to be “non-radiative” or Balmer-dominated shocks.
These occur when a fast shock runs into a cold, essen-
tially un-ionised ISM. A narrow component of the Balmer
lines arises from direct collisional excitation of Hydrogen
by the fast electrons, and a broad Balmer component is
produced by charge exchange with fast protons behind
the shock and subsequent collisional excitation of the fast
neutral hydrogen resulting by the hot electrons (Cheva-
lier & Raymond 1978; Chevalier et al. 1980) – see the
reviews by Heng (2010) and Ghavamian et al. (2013),
and references therein.

In Figure 14, we show the HST view of the P08 region,
and the spectrum extracted from the WiFeS data cube.
It is most likely that the broad component of Hα seen in
the spectroscopy arises from the ﬁlaments which are visi-
ble in the Hα image, but not in the [S II] image. A broad
component is also weakly detected in Hβ. This would
add N132D to the select group of SNR in which this has
been detected – which includes Tycho, SN 1006, RCW 86,
the Cygnus Loop and N103B and SNR 0519-69.0 (DEM
N71) in the LMC (Tuohy et al. 1982; Ghavamian et al.
2001, 2002, 2017). Most, but not all, of these remnants
are from Type Ia supernova explosions, since these do not
produce a burst of strong EUV radiation to pre-ionise the
pre-shock medium. However, if the ISM is shielded from
the EUV ﬂash in some way, or if it is dense enough to
recombine in the period between the explosion and the
arrival of the shock, then nothing precludes the forma-
tion of a Balmer-dominated shock. Given the inferred
age of the SNR, the recombination condition would im-
ply that the shock is passing through a medium with a
density (cid:38) 20 cm−3. The width of the Hα line suggests
that the shock velocity in the Balmer-dominated shock
is of order ∼ 900 km/s. This is similar to the blast wave
velocity derived from the X-ray data (Favata et al. 1997;
Hughes et al. 1998; Borkowski et al. 2007), so it seems
extremely likely that the broad Balmer lines arise in the
blast wave itself.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The environment of N132D provides an excellent sam-
pling of shocked clouds in the Bar of the LMC. The
typical physical size of these clouds is ∼ 1.0 pc. Given
that they have a typical pre-shock density of ∼ 240 cm−3
(from Table 5), we can infer cloud masses of few solar
masses. Using the images from Figure 3 and the pre-
shock densities from Table 5, we obtain masses in the
range 0.1 − 20 M(cid:12) with a mean of ∼ 4 M(cid:12). Thus we
infer these clouds initially represented typical ISM self-
gravitating Bonnor-Ebert spheres such as those recently
investigated on a theoretical basis by Sipil¨a et al. (2011),
Fischera (2014) and Sipil¨a et al. (2017). Given that the
shock which moves into them following the passage of
the supernova blast-wave is strongly compressive, and
that such Bonnor-Ebert spheres can be marginally sta-
ble against collapse, it is tempting to imagine that the
supernova shock may later induce formation of ∼ 1.0M(cid:12)
stars within the cores of those clouds.

Shocked Clouds in N132D

13

Now, let us consider the discrepancy between the ther-
mal pressure measured by the X-rays, and the ram
pressure driving the cloud shocks, pointed out in Sec-
tion 4.1. The X-ray plasma has a thermal pressure of
Ptherm = 6.4 × 10−8 dynes cm−2, while the ram pressure
in the clouds is Pram = 3.1 × 10−7 dynes cm−2. However,
the pressure driving the cloud shocks is provided by the
stagnation pressure behind the cloud bow shock or bow
wave produced in the expanding thermal plasma which
ﬁlls the SNR. This is always greater than the pressure
in the pre-shock hot thermal plasma. The geometry of
this interaction is pictured in McKee & Cowie (1975);
Hester & Cox (1986) and Farage et al. (2010).
In the
framework of a plane-parallel strong shock engulﬁng the
cloud the stagnation pressure is about twice as large as
the thermal pressure (McKee & Cowie 1975; Hester &
Cox 1986) and this is only very weakly dependent to the
Mach number of the primary blast wave (see Hester &
Cox (1986), Table 2).

The X-ray data enable us to estimate the stagnation
pressure in two ways. First, we may use the Sedov
theory to estimate the blast wave velocity. Using the
ﬁgures given in Hughes et al. (1998) for the explosion
energy, age and pre-shock density in the SNR, we de-
rive the blast-wave velocity, vB = 830 km/s. Alterna-
tively, we can use the measured thermal plasma temper-
atures to derive the blast wave velocity, using the relation
TB = (3µmH /16k)v2
B, where mH is the pre-shock hydro-
gen density and the molecular weight µ is appropriate to
a fully-ionised plasma. Estimates of the thermal temper-
ature are in the range 0.68 < kT < 0.8 keV (Favata et al.
1997; Hughes et al. 1998; Borkowski et al. 2007), which
implies a blast wave velocity of ∼ 760 km/s. Therefore,
the ram pressure associated with expansion is ∼ 4×10−8
dynes cm−2. Adding this to the thermal pressure gives an
estimate of the stagnation pressure, ∼ 1.0 × 10−7 dynes
cm−2.

The remaining diﬀerence between the ram pressure of
the cloud shocks and the estimated stagnation pressure is
a factor of three. This diﬀerence may be accounted for by
the fact that the cloud shocks are convergent towards the
centre of mass, a possibility raised in the context of the
Cygnus Loop SNR by Hester & Cox (1986) as a promis-
ing mechanism for increasing pressure in shocked dense
clouds. For shocks in self-gravitating isothermal spheres
such as those considered here, families of self-similar so-
lutions have been obtained by Lou & Shi (2014). In such
shocks, the energy density increases as the shock moves
toward the center of the cloud, increasing the ram pres-
sure. This eﬀect can easily account for the diﬀerence be-
tween the measured ram pressure of the cloud shocks and
the estimated stagnation pressure. Additionally, conver-
gent cloud shocks are unstable in the presence of small
deviations from sphericity (Kimura & Tosa 1990), and
elongated clouds may break up into separate globules
(Kimura & Tosa 1991). Such instabilities are the likely
reason for the complex morphologies of the shocks in in-
dividual clouds seen in Figure 3.

Because the shocked clouds of N132D represent
gravitationally-conﬁned samples of the ISM as they ex-
isted before the supernova event, and because these
clouds are dense enough that they would not be ap-
preciably aﬀected in their chemical composition by any

pre-supernova mass-loss, they present ideal samples of
pristine ISM in the LMC. Our radiative shock analysis
has enabled us to estimate accurate gas-phase chemical
abundances for a number of elements.

From our model grid, we have demonstrated that the
[O III] λλ4363/5007 ratio is a good indicator of shock
velocity, and that the He II/He I λλ4686/5876 ratio may
also be used for this purpose, although it is rather less re-
liable. Typical shock velocities are ∼ 240 km/s, in agree-
ment with the shock velocities inferred from the kinemat-
ics and the measured emission line widths. Using these
emission line diagnostics, we have analysed the depletion
onto dust in the various ionic stages of Fe, and in Mg II
Ca II and Ni II. In common with the SNR N49, we ﬁnd
that dust has been mostly destroyed in the region emit-
ting the [Fe II] lines, while a smaller fraction has been
destroyed in the Fe III and Fe VII zones, consistent with
the grain destruction models of Seab & Shull (1983) and
Borkowski & Dwek (1995). However, Mg II shows an
appreciably higher depletion factor, suggesting that the
Mg silicates are more resistant to destruction than the
Fe-bearing grains.

It is clear that the highly ionised species of iron; Fe X
and Fe XIV originate in faster, partially radiative, ﬁla-
mentary and spatially extensive shocks surrounding the
dense clouds. Some of these shocks may well be part of
the primary blast wave of the SNR. In these, most of
the refractory elements have been destroyed by thermal
sputtering.

A detailed shock analysis of the four brightest clouds
has allowed us to determine the chemical abundances
of a number of elements. Comparing these with values
given earlier, and with stellar abundance determinations
we can now provide a “recommended” set of LMC abun-
dances, which we present here in Table 8. Here, for com-
pleteness, the abundances of C, Mg, Si and Fe have been
taken from the work of Korn et al. (2002) using Magel-
lanic Cloud B-stars in NGC 2004.

Finally we have identiﬁed two anomalous regions, P08
and P20. The former contains a contribution from fast
Balmer-dominated shocks, while the latter represents an
unusual partially-radiative shock, dominated by precur-
sor emission which seems to be heated by an unknown
source to very high electron temperatures.

APPENDIX
In the following four Tables, A1 through A4, we present the measured line ﬂuxes of the 20 shocked ISM clouds in
N132D. No reddening correction has been applied, since the mean Balmer Decrement as measured; Hα/Hβ/Hγ/Hδ
= 298.7/100.0/44.7/23.9 is indistinguishable (within the errors) with the theoretical Balmer Decrement for log ne =
104 cm−3, and Te = 5000 K; 300/100/46.0/25.3. On the basis of the soft X-ray absorption Borkowski et al. (2007)
determined a best-ﬁt hydrogen column density of 1.4 × 1020 cm−2 in the western part of N132D and 1.4 − 4.1 × 1021
cm−2 in the south. Assuming dust is not destroyed in the bar of the LMC, and using the Fitzpatrick (1986) NH/EB−V
conversion factor, these ﬁgures would imply a reddening of EB−V = 0.005 mag. and 0.06–0.17 mag., respectively.
