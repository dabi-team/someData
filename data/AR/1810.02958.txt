Investigation of white-light emission in circular-ribbon ﬂares

Yongliang Song1,2, Hui Tian1

ABSTRACT

Using observations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory from June 2010 to
December 2017, we have performed the ﬁrst statistical investigation of circular-
ribbon ﬂares (CFs) and examined the white-light emission in these CFs. We ﬁnd
90 CFs occurring in 36 active regions (ARs), including 8 X-class, 34 M-class, 48
C- and B-class ﬂares. The occurrence rate of white-light ﬂares (WLFs) is 100%
(8/8) for X-class CFs, ∼62% (21/34) for M-class CFs, and ∼8% (4/48) for C-
and B-class CFs. Sometimes we observe several CFs in a single AR, and nearly
all of them are WLFs. Compared to normal CFs, CFs with white-light enhance-
ment tend to have a shorter duration, smaller size, stronger electric current and
more complicated magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that for X-class WLFs, the white-
light enhancement is positively correlated with the ﬂare class, implying that the
white-light enhancement is largely determined by the amount of released energy.
However, there is no such correlation for M- and C-class WLFs, suggesting that
other factors such as the time scale, spatial scale and magnetic ﬁeld complexity
may play important roles in the generation of white-light emission if the released
energy is not high enough.

Introduction

Flares associated with a sudden enhancement of optical continuum emission are deﬁned
as white-light ﬂares (WLFs). Since the ﬁrst observation of WLF in human history by Car-
rington (1859) and Hodgson (1859), the number of WLFs recorded in literature is very small
compared to the total number of solar ﬂares (Fang et al. 2013). Though rarely observed,

WLFs are important for ﬂare research. First, they can help us to understand the energet-
ics of stellar ﬂares, which are often observed in white light (WL). Second, they are usually
thought to result from some extreme conditions, which greatly challenges theories of ﬂare
energy transportation (Neidig 1989) and heating mechanisms in the lower atmosphere (Ding
et al. 1999a).

Though WLFs were discovered more than 150 years ago, a satisfactory theoretical un-
derstanding of WLFs is still lacking (Hudson 2016). Many questions remain unknown or
controversial. Most observations appear to suggest that WLFs are associated with energetic
events such as X-class ﬂares. However, later it was found that some small C-class ﬂares can
also be WLFs (Matthews et al. 2003; Hudson et al. 2006; Jess et al. 2008). Many studies
reveal a good correlation of the WL emission with hard X-ray (HXR) and radio emissions
both in time and space (Hudson et al. 1992; Metcalf et al. 2003; Chen & Ding 2005, 2006;
Krucker et al. 2011; Hao et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2015; Yurchyshyn et al. 2017; Song et al
2018a). These WLFs are usually believed to result from accelerated high-energy non-thermal
electrons (Neidig 1989; Fletcher et al. 2008; Kuhar et al. 2016). However, in other cases no
such correlation has been found (Ryan et al. 1983; Ding et al.1994; Sylwester 2000), and it
is unclear what heating mechanisms of this type of WLFs are. Theoretically, several heat-
ing mechanisms have been proposed to explain the WL emission, including electron beam
bombardment (Hudson & Ohki 1972; Aboudarham & Henoux 1986), Alfv´en wave dissipa-
tion (Fletcher & Hudson 2008), backwarming (Machado et al. 1989; Metcalf et al. 1990;
Heinzel & Kleint 2014) and chromospheric condensation (Gan & Mauas 1994; Kowalski et
al. 2015). All of them can describe or explain some characterstics of WLFs. However, due
to observational limitations, it is very diﬃcult to tell which mechanism dominates in a WLF.
In addition, current observations often cannot tell whether the WL emission comes from the
photosphere (Mart´ınez Oliveros et al. 2012; Watanabe et al. 2013), chromosphere (Battaglia
& Kontar 2012; Krucker et al. 2015), or both.

It is widely believed that the magnetic ﬁeld topology plays a signiﬁcant role in solar
eruptions (e.g., Zhang & Low 2005; Zhang & Flyer 2008; Sun et al. 2015; Guo et al.
2017; Yang et al. 2017). The evolution of magnetic ﬁeld structures results in the magnetic
energy transportation from the solar interior to the surface, and the storage in the corona
(e.g., Berger 1988; Zhang & Low 2005). Many studies reveal that the productivity of ﬂares or
CMEs in an AR is closely related to the complexity of the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., Zirin & Liggett
1987; Wang et al. 1991; Liu et al. 2016). Magnetic ﬁeld evolution, such as ﬂux emergence
and cancelation (e.g., Zirin & Wang 1993; Schmieder et al. 1997; Chen & Shibata 2000;
Zhang et al. 2001; Louis et al. 2015), rapid shearing motion around the polarity inversion
lines (PILs; e.g., Meunier & Kosovichev 2003; Yang et al. 2004; Shimizu et al. 2014), and
sunspot rotation (e.g., Zhang et al. 2007; Yan et al. 2009, 2015, 2016; Vemareddy et al.

– 3 –

2016), is crucial for the occurrence of ﬂares or CMEs. However, the role of magnetic ﬁeld
structure and its evolution in the production of WLFs is still poorly understood. Recently,
Song et al. (2018b) identiﬁed 20 WLFs in NOAA AR 11515 during its passage across the
solar disk. They found that all these WLFs occurred along a narrow ribbon-like negative ﬂux
region, with positive ﬂuxes on both sides. In their another work (Song et al. 2018a), they
found that the WL enhancement appeared at the footpoints of an erupting ﬁlament. These
results suggest a close relationship between WLFs and the magnetic ﬁeld environment.

The shapes of ﬂare ribbons depend largely on the magnetic ﬁeld structures of the hosting
ARs. Flares sharing a similar shape of ribbon are usually associated with a similar mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration. With recent high-resolution observations from both space-born and
ground-based telescopes, several circular-ribbon ﬂares (CFs) have been reported (Masson et
al. 2009; Wang & Liu 2012; Sun et al. 2013; Deng et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016; Yang
et al.2015; Xu et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018). These ﬂares are believed to be associated with
a fan-spine magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration (Sun et al. 2013). The line-of-sight photospheric
magnetograms usually reveal a central unipolar-ﬁeld region encompassed by the opposite-
polarity magnetic ﬁeld. Recently, Hao et al. (2017) and Song et al. (2018a) have identiﬁed
WL emission in this type of ﬂares. Similar to Kane et al. (1985) and Matthews et al. (2003),
Hao et al. (2017) also found two types of WL kernels: an impulsive one and a gradual one.
They are likely associated with diﬀerent heating mechanisms. Through magnetic ﬁeld ex-
trapolation, Song et al. (2018a) found a standard fan-spine topology of a CF. They also
found a ﬂux rope under the dome-like magnetic ﬁeld structure, which might be related to
the production of the WLF.

In this paper, we present results from the ﬁrst statistical investigation of CFs and
examine the occurrence of WL emission in these ﬂares. We describe the observations in
Section 2. Results and discussion are presented in Section 3. In Section 4 we give a brief
summary.

2. Observations

We mainly use the data obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Scherrer et al. 2012) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). HMI observes the full solar disk using the
spectral line of Fe I 6173 ˚A with a 4096 × 4096 CCD detector. The spatial resolution is
about 1′′. The AIA instrument obtains full-disk images of the Sun, with a cadence of 12 s
and 24 s in several extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) passbands, respectively.
The spatial resolution of an AIA image is about 1.5′′.

– 4 –

We ﬁrst searched for candidates of CFs from the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A daily movies
(15-min cadence) between 2010 June 1st and 2017 December 31st on the SDO website
(https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aiahmi/), then identiﬁed CFs from these candidates through
a visual inspection of the high-cadence movies using the JHelioviewer software (M¨uller et
al. 2017). In total 90 CFs from 36 ARs have been identiﬁed, including 8 X-class ﬂares, 34
M-class ﬂares, 47 C-class ﬂares and 1 B-class ﬂare. Table 1 lists these CFs. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the largest sample of CFs so far. It should be noted that the ribbons
of most identiﬁed CFs are nearly closed circles in the AIA 1600 ˚A images. However, the
ribbons of several identiﬁed CFs are not closed circles, but are more like half circles in the
AIA 1600 ˚A channel. These ﬂares are marked as quasi-circular (QC) events in Table 1.
The longitudinal component of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld measured by HMI reveals a
pattern of one polarity surrounded by the opposite-polarity magnetic ﬂuxes for these CFs.
We have also analyzed the hard X-ray data observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002). RHESSI observations are available
for 50 CFs.

WLFs are very rare among low-class (C-class and below) ﬂares. One reason may be that
the WL enhancements in these ﬂares are very weak compared to the background continuum
intensity. To enhance the visibility of WL emission, we followed the method described in
Song et al. (2018b) to construct the pseudo-intensity images by magnifying the diﬀerence
between the HMI continuum images taken at two adjacent times. It should be noted that
this method is just used to examine whether there is an impulsive enhancement of HMI
continuum intensity during a ﬂare. We ﬁnd 33 WLFs from these 90 CFs, including 8 X-
class, 21 M-class and 4 C-class ﬂares. In Table 1 the events marked with the star sign are
WLFs.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Occurrence rate of WLFs in CFs

The hosting AR numbers and GOES classes of the 90 CFs are shown in Figure 1. The
red and green dots refer to the WLFs and non-WL ﬂares, respectively. Some ARs are very
productive, each producing several CFs. For instance, NOAA AR 11476 has produced 5
CFs, and AR 11890 has produced 8 CFs. Most CFs are found in 18 ARs, each of which
has produced two or more CFs. This probably suggests that in a certain period these ARs
have a relatively stable magnetic ﬁeld structure. The magnetic ﬂux possibly changes after
the occurrence of the previous CF. However, the fan-spine topology likely remains till the
occurrence of the next CF. In contrast, each of the other 18 ARs only has one single CF,

– 5 –

possibly suggesting destruction of the fan-spine topology by eﬃcient reconnection during the
occurrence of the CF. For the ARs with several CFs, 10 of them have produced at least one
WLF. However, for the ARs with only one CF, only four of them show WL enhancement.

For a long time, WLFs have been rarely reported. However, with high-resolution space
observations, WLFs are more and more commonly observed. For instance, Watanabe et al.
(2017) identiﬁed approximately 100 ﬂares with M and X classes from observations of the
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) on board Hinode, and found that about
half of them are WLFs. Using HMI observations, Song et al. (2018b) identiﬁed 20 WLFs out
of a total of 70 ﬂares above C class (28.6%) in NOAA AR 11515. Our observation reveals
an even higher occurrence rate of WLFs in CFs. From Figure 1, we see that all the X-class
CFs are WLFs. So the occurrence rate of WLFs in X-class CFs is 100% in our sample. For
the M-class CFs, the occurrence rate of WLFs is ∼62%, which is still much higher than the
occurrence rate of WLFs found in previous investigations. However, only 4 CFs with a C
class are WLFs, corresponding to an occurrence rate of ∼8.5%. The only B-class CF in our
sample does not reveal any detectable WL enhancement.

Some ARs have each produced several CFs and all of them are WLFs, such as NOAA
ARs 11476, 11890 and 12297. Each of NOAA ARs 12268, 12434 and 12497 has also produced
several CFs. However, none of them is a WLF. Why are some ARs cradles of WLFs and
others not? We realize that CFs in the former group of ARs are generally much stronger
than those in the latter group, suggesting that CFs in the former group of ARs are more
energetic. In addition, the sizes of ﬂaring regions surrounded by the circular ﬂare ribbons
of CFs in NOAA AR 12268 are about 3 or 4 times larger than those in the former group
of ARs, implying that the spatial scale might be an important factor for the production of
WLFs.

3.2. Comparison of WL CFs with non-WL CFs

3.2.1. Area surrounded by circular ribbon

Figure 2 presents two examples of CFs. One is an M5.3 ﬂare occurring on 2011 Septem-
ber 6th in NOAA AR 11283, which has a big circular ribbon and is a non-WL ﬂare. The
other event is an X3.3 ﬂare occurring on 2013 November 5th in NOAA AR 11890, and the
area enclosed by the circular ribbon is small. This ﬂare is a WLF. The WL enhancement
is relatively large, with an average value (dI a
wl) of
∼1.05. The red circles shown in the middle and right panels mark the outer edges of the
circular ribbons in the 1600 ˚A images. We can see that the HMI magnetograms are clearly

wl) of ∼0.22 and a maximum value (dI m

– 6 –

characterized as one magnetic polarity surrounded by the opposite-polarity magnetic ﬂuxes.
For each CF we then calculated the area enclosed by the red circle, which is deﬁned as the
area of ﬂaring region (Scr). Deprojection has been done before the calculation.

Figure 4(a) shows the scatter plot of the relationship between the GOES 1-8 ˚A soft
X-ray peak ﬂuxes and the areas of ﬂaring region (Scr) for these 90 CFs. As mentioned
previously, all the X-class CFs are WLFs, regardless of the diﬀerent values of Scr. For the
M-class CFs, WLFs predominantly have smaller values of Scr. The average value of Scr for
the M-class WL CFs is about 1823 arcsec2. As a comparison, the average value of M-class
non-WL CFs is about 3865 arcsec2. Obviously, M-class CFs with a smaller ﬂaring region are
more likely to be WLFs. For C- and B-class CFs, most of them do not reveal any obvious
enhancement in the WL emission, even if the area of ﬂaring region is small. Only 4 C-class
CFs are WLFs, and the average area of their ﬂaring regions is about 863 arcsec2. An extreme
case is the C2.3 WL CF in NOAA AR 12615 marked by the green arrow in Figure 4(a). The
area of the ﬂaring region in this CF is only 194 arcsec2, which is the smallest in our sample.
For non-WL C-class CFs, the average value of Scr is about 1435 arcsec2.

The fact that CFs showing WL enhancement tend to be associated with smaller circular
ribbons may have important implications for the energy release in WLFs. In the fan-spine
magnetic ﬁeld topology, a small circular ribbon likely indicates a low-lying null point or
quasi-separatrix layer. Under such a situation, magnetic reconnection and the subsequent
energy release should occur at low heights. As a result, the released energy may penetrate
to the even lower atmosphere more easily, and produce enhanced WL emission there.
In
addition, a smaller ﬂaring region is equivalent to a larger energy ﬂux if the released energy is
the same. Obviously, a larger energy ﬂux will more likely impact the lower atmosphere and
produce excess WL emission. We noticed that Watanabe et al. (2017) found an association
of WLFs with shorter ribbon distances, which may also indicate lower reconnection heights
and thus is consistent with our ﬁnding.

3.2.2.

Flare duration

We have calculated two durations for each CF. One is the ﬂare duration (∆T ). The
beginning time is deﬁned as the time when the GOES 1-8 ˚A soft X-ray ﬂux starts to show a
steep monotonic increase. The ending time refers to the time when the GOES ﬂux decays to
a level halfway between the maximum and the pre-ﬂare background level. Another duration
is the duration of the impulsive phase (∆T ′). We ﬁrst took the time derivative of the GOES
1-8 ˚A ﬂux, then deﬁned ∆T ′ as the period when the derivative is above 1/e of the maximum
value. Figure 3 demonstrates how these two durations were calculated. The impulsive phase

– 7 –

duration (∆T ′) basically reﬂects how fast the energy is released in the impulsive phase.
Comparing to the whole ﬂare duration (∆T ), the impulsive phase duration (∆T ′) is usually
much shorter.

The values of ∆T and ∆T ′ for all the 90 CFs are plotted in Figure 4(b) and (c). There
is a clear trend that WLFs tend to have shorter durations. This is especially true for the
M-class ﬂares. The average values of ∆T and ∆T ′ for the M-class WL CFs are 808 s and 195
s, respectively. As a comparison, these two values are 1426 s and 244 s for M-class non-WL
CFs, respectively. For the small ﬂares (C-class and B-class), only four of them are WLFs
and their durations are much smaller than the average durations. An extreme case is the
C2.3 ﬂare occurring in NOAA AR 12615. This WLF is marked by a green arrow in Figure
4(b) and (c). Its durations are 300 s (∆T ) and 18 s (∆T ′), the shortest among all the 90
CFs.

In the statistical investigation of M- and X-class ﬂares observed with Hinode/SOT,
Watanabe et al. (2017) found that WLFs are generally characterized by a shorter timescale.
They concluded that the precipitation of many nonthermal electrons during a short time
period likely play a crucial role in the production of WL enhancement. Here through a
detailed investigation of CFs, we ﬁnd a similar result and thus a similar conclusion may be
drawn. Given the same amount of released energy, a shorter time scale means a larger rate
of energy precipitation. Under such a situation, the deposited energy may lead to rapid
heating of the lower atmosphere and produce enhanced WL emission more easily.

3.2.3. Magnetic ﬁeld and electric current in the region surrounded by circular ribbon

We also examined the possible diﬀerence of magnetic ﬁeld and electric current between
WLFs and non-WL ﬂares. The calculation of the electric current density perpendicular to
the photosphere (Jz) is based on the Ampere′s law:

Jz =

1
µ0

(▽ × B)z =

1
µ0

(

∂By
∂x

−

∂Bx
∂y

),

(1)

where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum, Bx and By are the two horizontal com-
ponents of the photosphere vector magnetic ﬁeld measured by HMI. It should be noted that
we used the hmi.sharp cea 720s vector magnetic ﬁeld, which has been processed by a cylin-
drical equal area (CEA) projection. The coordinates (x, y, z) here refer to the heliographic
longitude, latitude and radial directions.

Figure 5 shows spatial distribution of the vector magnetic ﬁeld and radial electric current

– 8 –

(Jz) in AR 11476 before an M5.7 WLF and in AR 12434 before an M1.1 non-WL ﬂare. The
vector magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬂaring region of AR 11476 is very complicated. The horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld in the main negative-polarity sunspot possesses a rotating pattern, which
implies a strong twist of the magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding electric current density is
very strong. The WL enhancements are generally located in regions with a large current
density (Figure 5(b)). In the ﬂaring region of AR 12434, the vector magnetic ﬁeld is less
complicated and the electric current density is much weaker than that of AR 11476.
It
should be noted that AR 11476 has produced 5 CFs, all of which are WLFs. Though AR
12434 has produced 8 CFs, none of them is a WLF. This diﬀerence might be related to the
diﬀerence of magnetic ﬁeld complexity and electric current density in the two ARs.

The radial components of the unsigned magnetic ﬁeld strength (|Bz|) and electric current
(|Jz|) integrated over the region enclosed by each circular ribbon are presented in Figure 7(a)
and (b), respectively. If we only consider CFs with a GOES class lower than X, we ﬁnd no
big diﬀerence of |Bz| between WLFs and non-WL ﬂares, though a weak trend of stronger
|Bz| in WLFs appears to be present. However, if the average magnetic ﬁeld is very weak,
i.e., |Bz| < 400G, then CFs are very unlikely to be WLFs. The electric current |Jz| appears
to be distinctly diﬀerent between WLFs and non-WL ﬂares. We see a clear trend that WLFs
are associated with larger |Jz| values, suggesting that the nonpotentiality plays an important
role in the generation of WL enhancement.

3.2.4. Hard X-ray power-law index

The hard X-ray (HXR) power-law index could reﬂect the process of electron acceleration
during a ﬂare. A larger power-law index (absolute value) usually means that the spectrum is
relatively soft with less high-energy electrons. While a smaller power-law index means that
the spectrum is relatively hard and that there are a larger number of high-energy electrons.
In our sample, 50 CFs were observed simultaneously by RHESSI. Among these 50 ﬂares, 21
are WLFs (4 X-class, 16 M-class and 1 C-class ﬂares) and 29 are non-WL ﬂares (9 M-class, 19
C-class and 1 B-class ﬂares). Following Huang et al. (2016), we ﬁtted the RHESSI spectra
at or around the peak times of the ﬂares by using the model of a variable thermal function
(vth) plus a broken power law function (bpow). As an example, Figure 6 shows the ﬁtting to
the RHESSI spectrum obtained during an M4.7 ﬂare on 2012 May 9th in NOAA AR 11476.

Figure 7(c) shows the HXR power-law indexes and the peak values of GOES ﬂux for
these 50 CFs. Among these 50 CFs, all the X-class CFs are WLFs, and almost all the C-
and B-class CFs are not WLFs. For the M-class CFs, we see no obvious diﬀerence of the
HXR power-law index between WLFs and non-WL ﬂares. A similar result has also been

found by Watanabe et al. (2017), though the ﬂares they analyzed are not CFs.

3.2.5. Association with CMEs

Based on the association with CMEs, ﬂares are classiﬁed as “eruptive ﬂares” and “con-
ﬁned ﬂares” (e.g., ˇSvestka & Cliver 1992). By checking the Solar and Heliospheric Observa-
tory (SOHO)/LASCO CME catalog (Yashiro et al. 2004; https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/)
and examining UV and EUV observations by AIA using the JHelioviewer software (M¨uller
et al. 2017), we ﬁnd 61 conﬁned ﬂares and 29 eruptive ﬂares in our sample. And among the
33 WLFs, 18 are conﬁned ﬂares and 15 are eruptive ﬂares. Thus, it appears that WLFs do
not have a preference to be eruptive ﬂares or conﬁned ﬂares.

3.3. WL enhancement in the CFs

More than half of the 90 CFs are accompanied by ﬁlament eruptions. Among the 33
WLFs, 20 are obviously associated with ﬁlament eruptions (11 of them have accompanied
CMEs and the other 9 have no accompanied CMEs), whereas the other 13 are not. For the
WLFs accompanied by ﬁlament eruptions, the WL enhancement could appear at the foot-
points of the erupting ﬁlaments (Figure 8(b) and (f)), below or in the vicinity of the ﬁlaments
(Figure 8(b)). These WL enhancements are likely related to the eruption of ﬁlaments. No
matter there is a ﬁlament eruption or not, all the WL enhancements in our sample appear
inside the circular ﬂare ribbons (Figure 8(c), (g) and (k)) or on the ﬂare ribbons (Figure
8(c) and (g)).

Figure 9 shows the relationship between the WL enhancement and the peak value of
GOES soft X-ray ﬂux. For each WLF, we deﬁne a WLF region as the area where the WL
enhancement ( (Ip−I0)/I0) is greater than 0.05. Here Ip and I0 represent the HMI continuum
intensities at the two times when the WL emission reaches the peak and before occurrence,
respectively. The average (dI a
wl) values of WL enhancement in the WLF
regions are presented on the left and right panels of Figure 9, respectively. For the X-class WL
CFs, there appears to be a positive correlation between the WL enhancement and the peak of
GOES soft X-ray ﬂux. Higher-class CFs tend to have stronger WL enhancement, indicating
that the WL enhancement is largely related to the total amount of released energy. However,
for the M- and C-class WL CFs, we see no obvious correlation between the magnitude of
WL enhancement and the ﬂare class. The absence of correlation possibly suggests that the
energy released during these relatively small ﬂares is not a dominated factor to determine

wl) and maximum (dI m

– 10 –

the WL enhancement. Other factors such as the time scale, spatial scale and the height of
energy release may also play equally important roles in the generation of WL enhancement.

Figure 10 shows the relationship between WL enhancement and other parameters includ-
ing the area of ﬂare region (Scr), HXR power-law index, ﬂare duration (∆T and ∆T ′), radial
component of the magnetic ﬁeld strength (|Bz|) and electric current (|Jz|). There seems to
be no strong correlation between the WL enhancement and these parameters, though there
is a weak tendency that a greater WL enhancement more likely occurs in ﬂares with shorter
impulsive phase durations (Figure 10(d)). Possibly, the magnitude of WL enhancement is
determined by a combination of diﬀerent parameters rather than a single parameter. It is
also possible that the main parameter that determines the magnitude of WL enhancement
is diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬂares.

4. Summary

We have performed the ﬁrst statistical study of CFs and investigated the WL emission
in these ﬂares. Our aim is to examine whether CFs, which are usually associated with a
fan-spine magnetic ﬁeld topology, are more likely to show WL enhancement. We have also
studied the diﬀerences between WL CFs and non-WL CFs. From nearly 8-year observations
of SDO, we have identiﬁed 90 CFs from 36 ARs, including 8 X-class ﬂares, 34 M-class ﬂares,
47 C-class ﬂares and 1 B-class ﬂare. Among these 90 CFs, 33 of them are WLFs, including 8
X-class CFs, 21 M-class CFs and 4 C-class CFs. Thus, the occurrence rate of WLFs is about
37% (33/90) for CFs. The occurrence rate is even larger, about 69% (29/42), for CFs greater
than M1.0. This is much higher than previously reported occurrence rates, suggesting that
the fan-spine magnetic ﬁeld topology favors the occurrence of WLFs. However, only about
8% (4/48) of the C- and B-class CFs are WLFs. It is also worth noting that some ARs have
each produced several CFs and nearly all of them are WLFs.

We have derived some parameters, including the area of the region surrounded by the
circular ribbon (Scr), ﬂare duration (∆T and ∆T ′), radial component of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld strength (|Bz|) and electric current (|Jz|), and HXR power-law index. We
have investigated the diﬀerences of these parameters between WL CFs and non-WL CFs.
Our analysis suggests that the CFs with WL enhancement tend to have a smaller spatial
scale, shorter duration, stronger and more complicated magnetic ﬁeld.

We ﬁnd that for X-class WL CFs, the WL enhancement has a positive correlation with
the ﬂare class. This result, together with the fact that all the identiﬁed X-class CFs are
WLFs, suggests that the magnitude of WL enhancement in large ﬂares is largely determined

– 11 –

by the amount of released energy. However, for M- and C-class WL CFs, there is no obvious
correlation between the WL enhancement and ﬂare class. This suggests that other factors
such as the time scale, spatial scale and magnetic ﬁeld complexity may play important
roles in the generation of WL emission if the released energy is not high enough. For
instance, if the released energy is low (C- and B-class), and the spatial and temporal scales
are extremely small, the released energy may still produce rapid and eﬃcient heating of the
lower atmosphere, leading to detectable WL enhancement.

We noticed that in other magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations even some X-class ﬂares may not
be WLFs (e.g., Watanabe et al. 2017). This observational fact, together with our ﬁndings
about CFs, suggest that the energy as measured by GOES classiﬁcation is not a suﬃcient
condition for the production of WL emission. A right magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration may also
be needed as well as enough energy. The GOES energy is likely a secondary consideration
for the production of WLFs of all classes. Of course, it should be noted that the energy as
measured by GOES is only a part of the ﬂare energy budget.
