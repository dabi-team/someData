ABSTRACT

Active Region (AR) 12192 is the biggest AR observed in solar cycle 24 so
far. This was a long-lived AR which survived for four Carrington rotations (CR)
and exhibited several unusual phenomena. We measure the horizontal subsurface
ﬂows in this active region in multiple rotations using the ring-diagram technique
of local helioseismology and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG+)
Dopplergrams, and investigate how diﬀerent was the plasma ﬂow in AR 12192
from that in AR 10486. Both regions produced several high M- and X-class
ﬂares but had diﬀerent CME productivity. Our analysis suggests that these ARs
had unusually large horizontal ﬂow amplitude with distinctly diﬀerent directions.
While meridional ﬂow in AR 12192 was poleward that supports the ﬂux transport
to poles, it was equatorward in AR 10486. Furthermore, there was a sudden
increase in the magnitude of estimated zonal ﬂow in shallow layers in AR 12192
during the X3.1 ﬂare, however, it reversed direction in AR 10486 with X17.2
ﬂare. These ﬂow patterns produced strong twists in horizontal velocity with
depth in AR 10486 that persisted throughout the disk passage as opposed to
AR 12192, which produced a twist only after the eruption of the X3.1 ﬂare that
disappeared soon after. Our study indicates that the sunspot rotation combined
with the re-organization of magnetic ﬁeld in AR 10486 was not suﬃcient to
decrease the ﬂow energy even after several large ﬂares that might have triggered
CMEs. Furthermore, in the absence of sunspot rotation in AR 12192, this re-
organization of magnetic ﬁeld contributed signiﬁcantly to the substantial release
of ﬂow energy after the X3.1 ﬂare.

Introduction

During the course of each solar activity cycle, hundreds of ARs form and decay with
time. These regions are responsible for producing energetic events, e.g., ﬂares and coronal
mass ejections (CMEs), thus, known as the major drivers of space weather. Observations
show that a signiﬁcant number of CMEs originate from ﬂares (Yashiro et al. 2006). There
are further evidences that big ARs are generally formed during the declining phase of the
cycle and produce more ﬂares and CMEs than in ascending and maximum activity periods.
Many authors have investigated the possible relationships between ﬂare properties and the
CMEs physical parameters (Compagnino et al. 2017, and references therein), and also tried
to determine the ﬂare characteristics that may lead to the CME production (Liu et al. 2016,
and references therein). In general, big ARs do produce both ﬂares and CMEs. However,
there are few examples where large regions did produce ﬂares but no CMEs.

The most recent example is the NOAA 12192, the biggest AR in last 25 years which pro-
duced signiﬁcant number of ﬂares during its disk passage. However, only one small CME was
reported to originate from this region. In total, there were total 73 C-class, 35 M-class and 6
X-class ﬂares during 14 days of the disk passage (ftp://ftp.swpc.noaa.gov/pub/warehouse/).
Among them, the most intense ﬂare produced was X3.1 on 2014 October 24. In contrast
to AR 12192, the biggest AR of Solar Cycle 23, AR 10486, produced 16 C-class, 16 M-
class, 7 X-class ﬂares (including X17.2 ﬂare on 2003 October 28) and several associated halo
CMEs (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/). In Figure 1, we show sample magnetograms
of 12192 (top left) and AR 10486 (top right) around the same location on the solar disk but
almost 11 years apart. The lower panel illustrates the variation of sunspot area in AR 10486
and 12192 as these pass through the Earth-facing side of the Sun. It can be seen that AR
12192 was much bigger in size than AR 10486.

Since the appearance of AR 12192, several studies have been carried out to explore its
properties (Chen et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016; Inoue et al.
2016). However, these were conﬁned to studying the magnetic conditions during the X3.1
ﬂare with a focus on understanding its CME-poor nature. Sun et al. (2015) found a weaker
non-potential core region in AR 12192 with stronger overlying ﬁelds, and smaller ﬂare-related
ﬁeld changes when compared with other major ﬂare-CME-productive ARs 11158 and 11429
of Cycle 24. By studying various magnetic indices, they further added that the large amount
of magnetic free energy in AR 12192 did not translate into the CME productivity. The strong
conﬁnement from the overlying magnetic ﬁeld responsible for the poor CME production was
also conﬁrmed by Chen et al. (2015). In a diﬀerent study, Jing et al. (2015) also compared
the characteristics of the X3.1 ﬂare of AR 12192 with the X2.2 ﬂare of CME-productive AR
11158 in terms of magnetic free energy, relative magnetic helicity and decay index of these

– 3 –

ARs. The major diﬀerence between them was found to lie in the time-dependent change of
magnetic helicity of the ARs. AR 11158 showed a signiﬁcant decrease in magnetic helicity
starting 4 hours prior to the ﬂare, but no apparent decrease in helicity was observed in
AR 12192. By studying decay index, these authors also conﬁrmed the earlier ﬁndings of
Sun et al. (2015) and Chen et al. (2015) that the strong overlying magnetic ﬁeld was mainly
responsible for low-CME productivity in AR 12192. In order to provide more insight on this,
Liu et al. (2016) suggested that the large ARs may have enough current and free energy to
power ﬂares, but whether or not a ﬂare is accompanied by a CME is related to the presence
of a mature sheared or twisted core ﬁeld serving as the seed of the CME, or a weak enough
constraint of the overlying arcades. In a recent study, by analyzing SDO/HMI, SDO/AIA
and Hinode/SOT observations, Bamba et al. (2017) studied the X1.0 ﬂare that occurred in
the same region on 2014 October 25, which also did not trigger any CME. They found that
reversed magnetic shear at the ﬂaring location was responsible for this 3-ribbon ﬂare, and
the closed magnetic ﬁeld overlying a ﬂux rope did not reach the critical decay index that
prohibited the CME eruption.

Despite many studies describing the properties of AR 12192 above the solar surface, none
has been published so far on the subsurface characteristics. There are no well-deﬁned param-
eters from helioseismic studies that favor the CME-poor or CME-rich nature of any AR. How-
ever, in order to explore the subsurface signatures of eruptive events, Reinard et al. (2010)
studied the temporal changes in subsurface helicity preceding AR ﬂaring. Tripathy et al.
(2008) also investigated the changes in acoustic mode parameters before, during, and after
the onset of several halo CMEs. They found that the CMEs associated with a low value of
magnetic ﬂux regions have line widths smaller than the quiet regions, implying the longer
life-time for oscillation modes. However, an opposite trend was found in the regions of high-
magnetic ﬁeld which is a common characteristic of the ARs (Jain et al. 2008). Both these
studies were based on limited samples of ARs, hence a general conclusion was not achieved.

In this paper, we study subsurface ﬂows associated with AR 12192 and compare with
those in AR 10486. We also investigate the diﬀerences between them in order to understand
the CME-poor nature of AR 12192. The paper is organized as follows; the observations of
AR 12192 in multiple CRs are described in Section 2. We brieﬂy describe the ring-diagram
technique in Section 3, and subsurface ﬂows in AR 12192 and their comparison with AR
10486 in Section 4. We discuss possible scenario supporting diﬀerent characteristics of both
ARs in Section 5, and ﬁnally our results are summarized in Section 6.

2. Observations

2.1. Early observations of AR 12192 in EUV

Two ARs, NOAA 12172 and 12173, appeared near the east limb in CR 2155. These
regions were formed on the backside of the Sun and were closely located. Continuous ob-
servations show that both regions survived till they reached the west limb, however, AR
12173 decayed within a few days after crossing the limb while AR 12172 went through rapid
evolution. The AR 12172 was later labeled as AR 12192 after its appearance on the east
limb in CR 2156. To track the growth and decay of AR 12172 and AR 12173, respectively,
in particular on the invisible surface the the Sun, we use “all Sun” EUV Carrington maps
as described in Liewer et al. (2014). These maps are produced by combining EUV frontside
images from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) with the backside images from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO).

In Figure 2, we show sample helioseismic and corresponding EUV maps in 195˚A,
171˚A and 304˚A, and for four days. The helioseismic maps are the composite images of
the far- and near-side solar hemispheres, where the near hemisphere is represented by the
line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld and the farside by an image showing sound wave travel time vari-
ations. The locations of shorter travel times are darker regions indicating the locations of
high-magnetic ﬁeld concentration on the farside. The top two rows provide maps when AR
12172 and 12173 were present on the front side, and bottom two rows for those days when
they crossed the west limb. Similar to travel time maps, the high magnetic ﬁeld regions in
EUV images can easily be determined in the form of brightening in these images. It should
be noted that communications with the STEREO Behind spacecraft were interrupted on
2014 Oct 1 that hampered the required telemetry of the data. Nevertheless, a few images
from STEREO do exist that indicate the decay of AR 12173 between Sept 27 and Oct 5.
A closer inspection of the images on Sept 24 (Top row) clearly shows two well-developed
ARs in both photospheric magnetogram (last column) and EUV observations while in 2nd
row, showing observations for Sept 27, we notice dimming in the brightness of one AR. This
kind of reduction in EUV brightness is generally referred to as the decaying phase of the
AR or the depletion of magnetic ﬁeld strength. We further notice that only one AR was
present in EUV images on Oct 5 indicating that AR 12173 was completely decayed by this
time. Although there is a gap in the STEREO observations between Oct 5 and Oct 12, the
helioseismic maps strongly support the rapid growth of a strong magnetic ﬁeld region on the
farside which is discussed below. This region could not be further tracked in EUV due to
the interrupted communications with STEREO Behind spacecraft.

2.2. AR 12192 in multiple Carrington rotations - helioseismic imaging

Direct and continuous observations of the visible surface and the helioseismic far-side
imaging suggest that the AR 12192 was a long-lived active region. A careful examination of
these images clearly indicates that the AR survived at least for four CRs and went through
various evolutionary phases. Although this is the biggest region of the current solar cycle till
date, it did not produce the largest ﬂare of the cycle or any CME. Since NOAA assigns new
numbers to all ARs whenever these appear on the east limb irrespective of their reappearance
after completing a solar rotation, the far-side images are crucial to ascertain the life of such
ARs. The reliability of far-side images of ARs was tested in a series of papers by Liewer et al.
(2012, 2014) where helioseismic farside maps were compared with backside images of the Sun
from NASA’s STEREO mission. They found that approximately 90% of the helioseismic
active-region predictions matched with the activity/brightness observed in EUV at the same
locations. It should be noted that despite providing reasonable information on the existence
of ARs in the non-earth facing side of Sun, the current method of helioeseimic imaging has
a limitation on sensing strong signal near the limb. However, the signal becomes stronger
when the ARs move towards the far-side central meridian.

In Figure 3, we show the images of AR 12192 in four consecutive CRs (CR 2155 - 2158)
by including images of both visible and invisible surfaces. Here we shown images for every
fourth day with each row corresponding to AR’s appearance in the next CR. The region
of interest is marked by the white circle. Daily helioseismic maps of far side are available
at http://jsoc.stanford.edu/data/farside/ using HMI and http://gong2.nso.edu/products/
using GONG observations. The evolution of AR 12192 in multiple CRs is summarized in
Table 1.

3. Data and Technique

We utilize 1k × 1k continuous Doppler images from GONG at a cadence of 60 s. Al-
though better spatial resolution space observations from MDI on board SOHO during the
Dynamics run from 1995 – 2010 (1k × 1k at a cadence of 60 s) and from HMI on board SDO
(4k × 4k at a cadence of 45 s) are available since 2010, the GONG observations provide
a unique advantage in this work. All these instruments use photospheric lines; the GONG
and MDI observations are in the Ni I 6768˚A line as opposed to HMI observations in Fe I
6173˚A line. Although the inference of subsurface ﬂow should not be inﬂuenced by the spec-
tral line used in observations (Jain et al. 2006), the diﬀerent spatial resolution may introduce
some bias on the results mainly due to the sensitivity to diﬀerent mode sets for inversion
(Jain et al. 2013a). In addition, every instrument has some type of systematic eﬀects, thus

– 6 –

the use of consistent data for both ARs as well as quiet regions will minimize instrument
related bias, if any. Furthermore, the GONG observations will allow us to use the same
quiet region values from the deep minimum phase between cycles 23 and 24 as reference. It
is worth mentioning that there have been changes in the GONG instrumentation over the
period of this analysis, however these were limited to adding new capabilities only, e.g., the
modulator upgrade in 2006 to obtain high-cadence magnetograms and adding H-α ﬁlter in
2010 at a 20 s cadence for space weather studies, thus the Doppler observations were not
aﬀected. Therefore, the GONG network provides unique consistent data set of continuous
high-cadence and high-spatial resolution Dopplergrams for last one and half solar cycles that
can be used to study long-term solar variability.

We use the technique of ring diagrams (Hill 1988) to study the subsurface plasma
ﬂow in AR 12192 in multiple CRs. This method has been used in numerous studies to
investigate the acoustic mode parameters beneath ARs (Rajaguru et al. 2001; Tripathy et al.
2012; Rabello-Soares et al. 2016) as well as long-term and short-term variations in near-
surface ﬂows (Komm et al. 2015; Greer et al. 2015; Bogart et al. 2015; Howe et al. 2015;
Tripathy et al. 2015; Jain et al. 2015). It is widely understood that the strong concentration
of magnetic ﬁeld alters the behavior of acoustic waves by absorbing their power. As a
result, the inferences in these regions often encounter with large uncertainties. In a recent
study, the credibility of the ring-diagram method was tested by comparing near-surface ﬂows
with the surface ﬂows in three ARs calculated from ring-diagram and the local correlation
tracking methods, respectively (Jain et al. 2016). The authors reported a good correlation
between these two quantities. Studies further show that the uncertainties in inferences tend
to increase towards the limb (Jain et al. 2013b), hence our analysis is restricted to within
±45◦ from the disk center.

In the ring-diagram method, high-degree waves propagating in localized areas over the
solar surface are used to obtain acoustic mode parameters in the region of interest. In this
(128 × 128 pixels in the spatial directions)
×15
work, we track and remap the regions of 15
for 1664 min (referred to as 1 ring day) at the surface rotation rate (Snodgrass 1984). The
tracking rate of each central latitude in these regions is of the form cos(θ)[a0 + a2sin2(θ) + a4
sin4(θ)], where θ is the latitude and the coeﬃcients a0 = 451.43 nHz, a2 = − 54.77 nHz,
and a4 = − 81.17 nHz. We then apodize each tracked area with a circular function and a
three-dimensional FFT is applied in both spatial and temporal directions to obtain a three-
dimensional power spectrum that is ﬁtted using a Lorentzian proﬁle model (Haber et al.
2002),

P (kx, ky, ω) =

A
(ω − ω0 + kxUx + kyUy)2 + Γ2 +

b
k3

(1)

where P is the oscillation power for a wave with a temporal frequency (ω) and the total

– 7 –

x + k2

wave number k2 = k2
y. There are six parameters to be ﬁtted: two Doppler shifts
(kxUx and kyUy) for waves propagating in the orthogonal zonal and meridional directions,
the background power (b), the mode central frequency (ω0), the mode width (Γ), and the
amplitude (A). Finally, frequencies along with the ﬁtted velocities (Ux and Uy) and formal
errors are used as input to a regularized least square (RLS) method to estimate depth
dependence of various components of the horizontal velocity (zonal: Vx and meridional:
Vy). While the zonal component provides an estimate of the ﬂow in east-west direction,
the meridional component is for the north-south direction. The depth dependences of mode
kernels used in the inversion are shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that the kernels sharply
peaks near the surface due to the availability of large modes for the kernel construction,
however as the centroids of the kernels increases in depth, the kernels become broader and
the inversion’s depth resolution becomes poorer.

In order to investigate the subsurface variability with the evolution/decay of ARs, we
use quiet region values as a reference and subtract them from the AR values in various
time samples. Our analysis is restricted to radial order n = 0 – 6 in the frequency range of
1700µHz ≤ ν ≤ 5200µHz. It should be noted that we have used custom patches processed
through the latest version of the GONG ring-diagram pipeline (version 3.6.1). Although
.5 in both
both active regions studied in this paper were located close to the multiple of 7
directions (the grid spacing used in ring-diagram pipeline), the standard products provided
diﬀerent locations for AR 10486 on the solar disk from those for AR 12192. Hence, for the
direct comparison between these ARs, we have customized the time series in AR 10486 which
means the start and end times for each set are diﬀerent from the standard products.

◦

3.1. Quantitative estimates of magnetic activity

In our study, we also quantify the magnetic activity in various regions by calculating
the Magnetic Activity Index (MAI) in each sample using the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld
from the magnetograms. Here we convert magnetogram data to absolute values, average
over the length of a ring day and apodise them into circular areas to match the size of
the Dopplergram patches used in the ring-diagram analysis. We use both SOHO/MDI
and GONG magnetograms to calculate MAI. Since the entire period under study is not
covered by the MDI magnetograms alone, we use the 96 minute MDI magnetograms for 2003
and GONG magnetograms sampled every 32 minutes for 2008 and 2014. Lower threshold
values of 50 and 8.8 G are used for MDI (Basu et al. 2004) and GONG (Tripathy et al.
2015), respectively, which are approximately 2.5 times the estimated noise in the individual
magnetograms. In addition, we also correct the magnetic ﬁeld data from space for cosmic-ray

– 8 –

strikes. To generate a uniform set of MAIs, the MDI MAI values are scaled to GONG values
using a conversion factor of 0.31, which was obtained by relating the line-of-sight magnetic
ﬁeld measurements between these two instruments using a histogram-equalizing technique
(Riley et al. 2014).

4. Results

4.1. Systematics and the selection of quiet regions

In a study of the subsurface characteristics of any active region in multiple time samples,
the ﬁrst step is to eliminate the inﬂuence of systematic eﬀects, if any. The most common error
comes from the foreshortening that may arise due to the change in heliographic locations of
the tracked regions during the disk passage. To overcome this eﬀect, we calculate reference
values of quiet regions at the same heliographic locations as the AR and subtract them from
the AR values as described in Jain et al. (2012, 2015). As a result, we obtain residuals
that provide estimates of ﬂows due to the change in magnetism. Another problem is the
selection of quiet regions which may also inﬂuence the inferences. Tripathy et al. (2009) have
examined the role of the choice of quiet regions in helioseismic studies and demonstrated
that the results derived for the pairs of quiet and ARs were biased by the selection of quiet
regions. They further suggested that an ensemble average of quiet regions should be used in
such studies.

In previous studies, we have chosen quiet regions from the neighboring Carrington ro-
tations (Jain et al. 2012, 2015). However, for an unbiased comparison between ARs 12192
(CR 2155) and 10486 (CR 2009), we use same quiet regions from the deep minimum phase
between cycles 23 and 24 for both ARs. Note that this was the period of extremely low solar
activity, hence the values obtained with reference to this period can be termed as “true” AR
values. Although, both ARs appeared in two diﬀerent solar cycles, this selection of quiet
regions is supported by the following observational facts; (i) both ARs were observed in
same phase of the year when the values of the solar inclination angle (B0) were comparable,
and (ii) both ARs were located around the same latitude in the southern hemisphere (Fig-
ure 1). Thus the projection eﬀect in both cases can be uniformly removed by using the same
quiet-region values. The period of 2008 September thru December is used to determine the
quiet-region values.

We compute error-weighted averages of the MAIs for 13 ring days (approximate time
for any region to cross the disk) at each heliographic location. Since we are interested in
studying the temporal variation in the subsurface properties of AR 12192 in four CRs and

– 9 –

B0 varies from +7◦.0 (September) to −1◦.5 (December) during the period of analysis, the
quiet regions are selected in such a way that the values of MAI do not signiﬁcantly change
from region to region. Average MAIs for quiet regions at 15 disk positions along latitude
15◦ for four diﬀerent ranges of B0 are summarized in Table 2. The B0 values chosen here
correspond to those for the active regions analyzed in this paper. The regions along the
latitude 15◦ are separated by 7◦.5 and cover the solar surface from 60◦E to 60◦W. It can be
seen that the MAIs vary from 0.3 to 0.6 G and the standard deviation is within 18% with
largest values near the limb decreasing to about 8% near central meridian.

We further calculate the components of horizontal velocity corresponding to these quiet
regions and compute error-weighted averages of 13 ring days at each location as for MAIs.
As our selected regions have an overlap of 7◦.5, we smooth these components with 3-point
running mean which are later used as reference in the active-region analysis. The longitudinal
variation of these components across the disk is displayed in Figure 5 where diﬀerent panels
represent the averages for diﬀerent B0 ranges at four target depths below the surface, i.e.
3.1, 5.8, 10.2 and 14.2 Mm. It is clearly seen that the magnitude of Vx increases with depth
which is in agreement with the observations where rotation rate is found to increase with
depth in the outer 5% of the Sun. There are some variations in the magnitude of Vy as
well, however these are within 1σ. Further, both zonal and meridional velocities show an
east-west trend but it is more prominent in the zonal component. Also, the shallower layers
are more aﬀected by this systematic, which decreases with depth. To highlight the variation
in east-west trend with time, we plot, in Figure 6, the variation of both components with
disk location at depths 3.1 Mm and 14.2 Mm. We notice signiﬁcant variations in these
components with both time and depth. These systematics were also noticed by Zhao et al.
(2012) in the the time-distance analysis where they found both travel-time magnitude and
variation trends to be diﬀerent for diﬀerent observables. Though these authors did not
provide any physical basis for this eﬀect, they suggested that these systematics must be
taken into account for the accurate determination of ﬂows. Later, Baldner & Schou (2012)
explained this eﬀect in terms of highly asymmetrical nature of the solar granulation which
results in the net radial ﬂow. This east-west trend was also studied by Komm et al. (2015) in
ﬂows from the ring-diagram analysis for both GONG and HMI observations, where diﬀerent
data sets exhibited diﬀerent systematics. They concluded that the trends could be removed
adequately by selecting reference values from the same data source. Thus, in our study of
the temporal variation of ﬂows at diﬀerent depths, we use reference values that depend on
both depth and the disk location of the active region.

4.2. AR 12192 and subsurface horizontal ﬂows

Manifestation of strong magnetic ﬁelds is not only visible on the solar surface and beyond
in the solar atmosphere, it also has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the subsurface properties. While
most acoustic mode parameters tend to change linearly with the increase or decrease in
magnetic ﬁeld strength (Tripathy et al. 2015, and references therein), the velocity vectors
have a complex relationship. These are modiﬁed in the presence of strong ﬁelds, however
there are several other factors that may dominate amplitude and the direction of velocity
vectors. In general, the topology of ARs plays an important role in deﬁning the velocity
components. Also, moderately large number of modes are needed in inversion for reliably
calculating the depth dependence of ﬂows. The evolution or decay of the magnetic activity in
AR 12192 in multiple CRs is illustrated in Figure 7. Locations of the reference image (i.e. the
image at the center of each timeseries) are given in Table 3. Since the Carrington longitude
identiﬁes the unique location of any region on the solar surface, we have made sure that it
does not change with time. The heliographic location for this AR is 247◦.5 longitude and
−15o latitude. It can be seen that the magnetic ﬁeld strength in this AR became stronger
in the second rotation (CR 2156) which decayed to a moderate level in third rotation (CR
2157). It further decayed in the fourth rotation and the MAI values became comparable to
those in the ﬁrst rotation (CR 2155).

Among additional factors that may inﬂuence the inference of ﬂow vectors, the high
duty cycle is crucial in obtaining reliable ﬂows. The large gaps in observations or low duty
cycle reduce the number of ﬁtted modes that have signiﬁcant eﬀect on the inverted ﬂows
and produce large errors. Since the duty cycle in GONG observations varies from day-
to-day, primarily due to the changing weather conditions at observing sites or to system
maintenance/breakdown, the results may be altered. To authenticate our results, we also
include duty cycles in Table 3 and Figure 7 for each timeseries. It can be seen that these are
≥ 70% in all time series which is above the lower threshold set in earlier studies (R. Komm,
private communication). The mean duty cycles for eight ring days in each CR are 88.0%,
85.4%, 91.8% and 88.3% with the variation between 1.2σ to 2.3σ within the CR. Another
factor is the heliographic location of the region which also inﬂuences the number of modes.
Thus, ﬁtted modes are predominantly governed by all three factors; higher magnetic ﬁeld,
low duty cycle and the larger distance from disk center lead to a lower number of ﬁtted
modes. It is evident from the lower panel in Figure 7 that the number of modes in CR 2156
at each location is relatively low though the duty cycles at some locations are comparable
to other CRs. This clearly demonstrates the eﬀect of the signiﬁcantly strong magnetic ﬁeld
in CR 2156 on the acoustic modes, which reduces their amplitude and as a result, produces
large errors. We estimate the variation in number of modes is less than 2σ in each CR which
is higher than the variation in duty cycle.

– 11 –

Temporal variation of Vx and Vy for the AR in each CR are displayed in Figure 8. These
values are obtained by subtracting the quiet Sun values at the same locations. In the absence
of any high magnetic ﬁeld region, the meridional component is typically poleward (negative
values in the southern hemisphere) that provide basis for the magnetic ﬂux transport from
low latitudes to the poles, and the zonal component is in the direction of solar rotation.
However, as mentioned above, their amplitudes as well as directions are modiﬁed due to the
change in the characteristics of AR. We obtain maximum values of both velocity components
in CR 2156 in comparison to other three CRs. It is further noted that the values of both
components are comparable (within 1σ) in shallow layers in all CRs except CR 2156, however
these diﬀer moderately in deeper layers. We also ﬁnd very large ﬂows in deeper layers in
CR 2156. Since the MAI values are signiﬁcantly large in CR 2156 (Figure 7), these could be
responsible for the large ﬂows and diﬀerent behavior in this Carrington rotation. We also
notice exceptionally large errors at ±52◦.5 in CR 2156 that may arise due to lower number
of modes available for inversion as shown in Figure 7.

4.3. Comparison with AR 10486

The active region 10486 was a long-lived AR (Gonz´alez Hern´andez et al. 2007) that
produced several X- and M-class ﬂares and associated CMEs in cycle 23. The magnetic
classiﬁcation of this region was similar to AR 12192, however the ﬁeld strength was not as
strong as it was in AR 12192. There was a slow decrease in the magnetic ﬁeld in AR 10486 in
the next CR while it decreased signiﬁcantly in AR 12192. In order to compare the horizontal
ﬂows from both active regions, the position of ARs in the tracked cubes is crucial. If one
region is oﬀ centered from the other, the inferences of mode parameters and the ﬂows will
be biased by the area covered. Further, quiet areas within the tile will modify the results as
calculated ﬂows are averaged over the entire tile. To reduce the biasing of these factors, as
mentioned in Section 3, both regions are tracked at the Snodgrass rotation rate which allows
us to cover the same area in tracking ensuring that the ARs stay at the same location in
the tracked cube. Sample images of the evolution of ARs 12192 and 10486 in the tracked
cubes for eight consecutive ring days are shown in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. These
are the magnetogram regions near or at the reference image which is the center of the each
time series. Since both ARs are large, it is clearly visible that these cover a reasonably
large area of the tracked regions with stable positions of ARs within the tiles. The start
and end of each time series representing AR 12192 and AR 10486 at diﬀerent disk locations
are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Temporal variations of MAI, duty cycle and the
number of ﬁtted modes in both regions for two consecutive CRs are displayed in Figure 11.
As illustrated, the number of modes in AR 12192 and 10486 were comparable in the ﬁrst

– 12 –

two days and then diﬀerences started to arise which increased as ARs moved towards the
west. These diﬀerences may introduce some bias in the ﬂow estimates and the errors are also
large when diﬀerent mode sets are available for inversion. For convenience, in the following
analysis, we will refer to regions in diﬀerent CRs by their NOAA numbers. We, therefore,
compare the subsurface properties of AR 12192 with those of AR 10486, and AR 12209 with
AR 10508 in the next rotation.

Figure 12 illustrates the daily variation of zonal and meridional velocities. Our analysis
reveals a number of similarities as well as diﬀerences between ARs 12192 and 10486. We ﬁnd
that both ARs maintained signiﬁcantly large ﬂows during their disk passages but distinctly
diﬀerent directions. Locations of X3.1 and X17.2 ﬂares in ARs 12192 and 10486, respectively
are also marked in Figure 12 and also tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. The resultant amplitude
of both components is found to increase with depth. While there is a small change in Vx
in AR 12192 several days before the X3.1 ﬂare, the gradient is sharp in the case of AR
In fact, direction was reversed in AR 10486 a day before the ﬂare around 6 Mm
10486.
producing a twist in the horizontal velocity, whose amplitude continued to increase with
time. Interestingly, there was an increase in Vx in AR 12192 at the time of X3.1 ﬂare which
then decreased signiﬁcantly with a small twist near the surface despite producing another
X2.0 ﬂare. Furthermore, the calculated meridional components showed a diﬀerent trend;
although there was a small temporal variation in AR 10486, the maximum values in AR
12192 in deeper layers were achieved a day before the X3.1 ﬂare with the decreasing trend
after that.

Figures 13a and 13b illustrate the depth variation of estimated total horizontal velocity
at eight disk locations where each panel represents an individual ring day. It is evident that
there are strong twists in the ﬂows for AR 10486 and that the pattern persists for the ﬁrst
ﬁve days. Previous studies show that this kind of twist is generally associated with strong
ﬂares. As indicated in Table 4, there were a series of X- and M-class ﬂares from this AR
before and after the major X17.2 ﬂare on Day 4, which we ﬁnd to be responsible for the
observed twists for several days. Note that there was X8.3 ﬂare on Day 8 that started near
the end of time series used in the analysis but continued beyond the end time. We ﬁnd a
slight twist near the surface in this case too but a complete ﬂow pattern associated with this
ﬂare was not achieved. Nevertheless, the twist appears in AR 12192 on Day 7 only after
the X3.1 ﬂare despite the fact that there were other major ﬂares before and after this event
(see Table 3). Our analysis suggests that the twist disappeared thereafter when the region
was centered at longitude 52
5W. It is clear from Figure 11 that the number of ﬁtted modes
depends on the location of the region on the solar disk, decreasing as the AR moves away
from the disk center making the inferences noisier with higher uncertainties. In addition,
any magnetic ﬁeld within the region and the duty cycle inﬂuence this number. Further,

◦

– 13 –

the outer boundary of the reliable inferences depends on the spatial resolution of input
in either direction
Dopplergrams and the GONG resolution puts this limit at around 45
(Jain et al. 2013b). However, we have plotted ﬂows at 52
5W to understand their behavior
after large ﬂares, where we ﬁnd the twist has disappeared and the values are expected to be
biased by moderately large uncertainties. In next CRs, as evident from Figure 12, there was
a signiﬁcant decrease in the ﬂow amplitude in both ARs.

5. The plausible scenario

It is believed that the magnetic ﬁelds are generated in a thin layer at the base of con-
vection zone, known as the tachocline, hence the subsurface properties may provide useful
information on their evolution. The techniques of local helioseismology are widely used to
obtain vital information from the convection zone beneath quiet as well active regions. In
last couple of decades, with the availability of high-resolution continuous observations at
high cadence, it has become possible to map plasma ﬂow in the convection zone and derive
quantities that are directly linked with the measurements on the surface (Komm & Gosain
2015). Further, Komm et al. (2012, and references therein) carried out several studies on a
large sample of ARs to understand the overall behavior in their evolutionary and decaying
phases. In addition, helioseismic studies describing subsurface characteristics beneath indi-
vidual ARs are also available (Zhao & Kosovichev 2003; Komm et al. 2008; Jain et al. 2012;
Zhao et al. 2014; Jain et al. 2015). All these studies converge to a common conclusion that
the magnetic regions show considerably higher subsurface velocities compared to the quiet
regions and the velocities increase or decrease with the strength of magnetic elements within
the region. In this study, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly large velocities in ARs as compared to the
quiet regions, however the quantitative measures of these velocity ﬁelds depend on various
factors that are described below.

In this paper we studied two big ARs, NOAA 12192 and 10486, from two diﬀerent solar
cycles. There are many similarities as well as diﬀerences in the morphology of these regions.
Both were large in size at the time of their appearance on the east limb and maintained a
complex magnetic conﬁguration, βγδ, throughout their disk passages. Despite being larger
in size and also having stronger magnetic ﬁeld than in 10486, the sunspot counts in AR
12192 were signiﬁcantly lower. In contrast, AR 10486 had several rotating sunspots with
high rotational velocity. These rotating sunspots are identiﬁed by their rotation around the
umbral center or other sunspots within the same AR. The large positive-polarity sunspot in
this region was reported to rotate uniformly at a rate of 2◦.67 hr−1 for about 46 hours prior
to the major ﬂare on 2003 October 28 (Kazachenko et al. 2010). Studies show that the role

– 14 –

of sunspot rotation in ﬂare energetics is complex and it is often argued that the rotation of
the sunspot produces energy and magnetic helicity more than the non-rotating case, thus
triggering large ﬂares. Kazachenko et al. (2010) suggested that the sunspot rotation in AR
10486 contributed signiﬁcantly to the energy and helicity budgets of the whole AR. They
further emphasized that the shearing motions alone stored suﬃcient energy and helicity in
AR 14086 to account for the ﬂare energetics and interplanetary coronal mass ejection helicity
content within their observational uncertainties. In our previous study, we investigated the
subsurface ﬂows in AR 11158 that had several rotating sunspots and was the source region
of ﬁrst X-class ﬂare with a halo CME in cycle 24 (Jain et al. 2015). The characteristics
of subsurface ﬂows in AR 11158 are similar to those in AR 10486 reported in this paper
but the amplitude is signiﬁcantly lower. A series of CMEs erupted from both AR 11158
(Kay et al. 2017) and AR 10486 (Gopalswamy et al. 2005). A closer comparison of ﬂows
in AR 10486 (Figure 12) and AR 11158 (Figure 8 of Jain et al. (2015)) clearly shows that
the meridional ﬂows are more aﬀected by the CME eruption while rotating sunspots play
a critical role in deﬁning the zonal ﬂows. Note that ﬁrst CMEs reported from ARs 10486
and 11158 were on 2003 Oct 18 and 2011 Feb 13, respectively. Thus, we obtain similar ﬂow
patterns in these two ARs. However, the ﬂows in AR 12192 display diﬀerent characteristics,
which we interpret in terms of its CME-poor nature. Further, by exploiting the high spatial
resolution of HMI, we also studied ﬂows in three sub-regions within AR 11158 and found
that the leading and trailing polarity regions move faster than the mixed-polarity region.
Since the spatial resolution of GONG Dopplergrams does not provide suﬃcient modes near
the surface to obtain reliable inferences in individual polarity regions, our present study is
conﬁned to the investigation of subsurface ﬂows in ARs as a whole.

We show, in Figure 14, the depth variation of ﬂow kinetic energy in AR 12192 and
AR 10486 for 8 consecutive days when several large ﬂares were triggered. The regions
corresponding to major ﬂares are also marked in the Figure. Here, the energy density
values are calculated using the density proﬁle in the solar interior from model “S” of
Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (1996).
It can be seen that energy density increases expo-
nentially with depth, mainly due to the rapidly increasing density. Note that these are the
resultant energy density values which are elevated from the quiet region values due to the
presence of high magnetic ﬁeld. We notice a signiﬁcant variation in energy density with time
in the case of AR 12192 (upper panel) while no signiﬁcant variation is seen in AR 10486
It increases gradually in AR 12192 for the ﬁrst 5 days although there
except on Day 1.
were two large ﬂares (M8.7 and X1.6) on Day 4.
It appears that the energy released by
these ﬂares was not suﬃcient to disrupt the ﬂow which eventually decreased signiﬁcantly
with the eruption of the X3.1 ﬂare on Day 6. After this event, at a depth of about 13
Mm, almost 50% of the energy was dissipated which further decreased from Day 6 to Day

– 15 –

7 and increased from Day 7 to Day 8 with the eruption of several big ﬂares. In all cases,
this change in kinetic energy was relatively small in the upper 4 Mm. However, below this
depth, there were signiﬁcant changes in ﬂow energy - from 400% around 5.8 Mm to 650%
around 7.2 Mm, and this variation gradually decreased in much deeper layers. In contrast to
these results, the energy variation was minimal in AR 10486, which produced several major
ﬂares on four consecutive days, including an X1.2 on Day 2, M6.7 on Day 3, X17.2 on Day 4
and X10.0 on Day 5. We believe that all these ﬂares must have lowered the kinetic energy,
however there were some other processes that rapidly supplied energy to AR 10486. Thus,
the small variation in ﬂow energy with time in AR 10486 provided favorable conditions for
more energetic eruptions, e.g. CMEs in this case.

In the next rotation, as shown in Figure 15, the ﬂow energy decreased substantially,
almost by a factor of 4, in both regions. Further, the ﬂow energy in AR 10508 (10486) is
signiﬁcantly higher than in AR 12209 (12192) in deeper layers while it is comparable in both
regions above 4 Mm. Our study suggests that additional factors, e.g., the sunspot rotation
combined with the re-organization of magnetic ﬁeld in AR 10486, were not suﬃcient to
decrease the ﬂow energy even after several large ﬂares and triggered CMEs. Furthermore, in
the absence of sunspot rotation in AR 12192, the re-organization of magnetic ﬁeld contributed
signiﬁcantly in the substantial release of ﬂow energy after the X3.1 ﬂare.

6. Summary

AR 12192 is the biggest AR observed in solar cycle 24 till date. It appeared on the east
limb on 2014 October 18 and grew rapidly into the largest such region since 1990. Composite
images of helioseismic farside maps and the direct frontside observations, in conjunction with
STEREO and SDO/AIA EUV observations, clearly show that it was a long-lived ARs that
survived at least four CRs and exhibited several unusual phenomena. Over the period of four
rotations, it had the most complex magnetic conﬁguration, βγδ, during second rotation, i.e
in CR 2156 with very strong magnetic ﬁeld and several large ﬂares without any associated
CMEs. We measured the horizontal subsurface ﬂows in AR 12192 in multiple rotations
applying the ring-diagram technique to the GONG+ Dopplergrams. Our analysis suggests
that it had unusually large horizontal ﬂow amplitudes before the X3.1 ﬂare on 2014 October
24 which were comparable to those in AR 10486 during Halloween solar events in 2003. Both
regions were located around the same latitude in southern hemisphere and produced several
high M- and X-class ﬂares but had diﬀerent CME productivity. In order to compare the
horizontal ﬂows from both active regions, the position of ARs in the tracked cubes is crucial.
If one region is oﬀ centered from the other, the inferences of mode parameters and the ﬂows

– 16 –

are biased by the area covered. Further, quiet areas within the tile also modiﬁes the results
as inferred quantities are averaged over the entire tile. To reduce the biasing of these factors,
both regions are tracked at the Snodgrass rotation rate, which allows us to cover the same
area in tracking ensuring that the ARs stay at the same location in the tracked cube. In
the case of ARs 12192 and 10486, if one AR is slightly oﬀ-centered from the other AR, both
cover signiﬁcantly large areas of the tiles and we believe that our results are less aﬀected by
the positioning of these ARs within the tiles.

Our analysis further suggests that ﬂow directions in these ARs were distinctly diﬀerent;
while meridional ﬂow in the AR 12192 was poleward that support ﬂux transport to the poles,
it was equatorward in AR 10486. Furthermore, there was a sudden increase in the magnitude
of estimated zonal ﬂow in shallow layers in AR 12192 during the X3.1 ﬂare, however, it
reversed direction in AR 10486 with X17.2 ﬂare. These diﬀerent ﬂow patterns provided strong
twists in the horizontal velocity with depth that persisted in AR 10486 throughout the disk
passage as opposed to AR 12192, which produced a twist only after the eruption of the X3.1
ﬂare that disappeared soon after. Over the period of eight ring days, we ﬁnd diﬀerent ﬂow
energy patterns in these regions; there was signiﬁcant variation in ﬂow energy with time in
the case of AR 12192 while no signiﬁcant variation is seen in AR 10486. It increased gradually
in AR 12192 for ﬁrst four days until the X3.1 was produced and then declined sharply. We
conclude that the sunspot rotation combined with the re-organization of magnetic ﬁeld in
AR 10486 was not suﬃcient to decrease the ﬂow energy even after triggering several large
ﬂares that might have been responsible for CMEs. Furthermore, in the absence of rotating
sunspots in AR 12192, the re-organization of magnetic ﬁeld contributed signiﬁcantly to the
substantial release of kinetic energy after the X3.1 ﬂare.

In future studies, we plan to identify ﬂaring regions with and without rotating sunspots
in both CME-rich and CME-poor categories to obtain a comprehensive picture linking the
role of subsurface ﬂows in the energetic eruptions. A study based on a large number of
dataset may be crucial for providing subsurface thresholds for the extreme space weather
events. It would also be interesting to investigate the subsurface characteristics of unique
regions with CMEs but which are not associated with ﬂares.
