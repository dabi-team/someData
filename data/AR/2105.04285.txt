To increase the light yield of a liquid Ar (LAr) detector, we optimized the evaporation
technique of tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) on the detector surface and tested the oper-
ability of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), namely, the multi-pixel photon counter with
through-silicon-via (TSV–MPPC, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) at LAr temperature.
TPB converts the LAr scintillations (vacuum ultraviolet light) to visible light, which
can be detected by high-sensitivity photosensors. Because the light yield depends on
the deposition mass of TPB on the inner surface of the detector, we constructed a well-
controlled TPB evaporator to ensure reproducibility and measured the TPB deposition
mass using a quartz crystal microbalance sensor. After optimizing the deposition mass of
TPB (30 µg/cm2 on the photosensor window and 40 µg/cm2 on the detector wall), the
light yield was 12.8 ± 0.3 p.e./keVee using PMTs with a quantum eﬃciency of approx-
imately 30% for TPB-converted light. We also tested the low-temperature tolerance of
TSV–MPPC, which has a high photon-detection eﬃciency, in the LAr environment. The
TSV–MPPC detected the LAr scintillations converted by TPB with a photon-detection
eﬃciency exceeding 50%.

Introduction

Owing to its desirable features, liquid argon (LAr) is a widely used scintillator in particle-
detection experiments [1][2]. For instance, nuclear recoil (NR), and electron recoil (ER)
events can be distinguished by their diﬀerent pulse shapes in the LAr scintillation [3]. Pulse-
shape discrimination (PSD) signiﬁcantly reduces the ER background in the search for rare
NR events such as dark matter signal. The ER reduction power of PSD is strengthened
by improving the light yield. Detectors with high-light-yield also beneﬁt the energy recon-
struction, especially in regions of low recoil energy. Therefore, the light yield is a crucial
parameter in LAr scintillation detectors. In this study, we increase the light yield by opti-
mizing the evaporation technique of a wavelength shifter and testing the operability of a
silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), namely, the multi-pixel photon counter with through-silicon
via (TSV–MPPC, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) at LAr temperatures (87 K).

LAr scintillation light is a vacuum ultraviolet that peaks at 128 nm [4]. Photosensors, which
are operational at LAr temperature, are in general not sensitive to LAr scintillation light.
To eliminate this problem, we convert the LAr scintillation light to visible light (420 nm

 
 
 
 
 
 
[5][6]) using 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB) as a wavelength shifter. The resulting
light is detectable by high-sensitivity cryogenic photosensors. The light yield depends on the
deposition mass and surface conditions of the TPB coating on the detector surface, which
is deposited using the vacuum evaporation technique [7][8]. We thus constructed a well-
controlled TPB evaporation system with good reproducibility and measured the deposition
mass of TPB using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor. The deposition mass of TPB
was optimized by measuring the wavelength-shifting eﬃciency and transmittance (Section
2). The light yield is directly proportional to the photon-detection eﬃciency (PDE) of a
photosensor. Although the sensitivity of TSV–MPPC to visible blue light (>50%) exceeds
that of traditionally used PMTs (<30%), the operability of TSV–MPPC at LAr temperature
has not been assured. We therefore checked the low-temperature tolerance of TSV–MPPC
in the LAr environment (Section 3) and demonstrated the operation of a small-size LAr
detector with TSV–MPPC arrays (Section 4). All the measurements were performed at LAr
temperature at the test stand in the surface laboratory of Waseda University. The LAr test
stand is described elsewhere [9].

2. Optimization of the TPB evaporation technique
2.1. TPB evaporation system

TPB was evaporated in a stainless vacuum vessel (diameter = 42 cm, height = 40 cm) with a
top ﬂange plate to access the internal structures. The TPB evaporation process was observed
through a viewport on the side of the vacuum vessel. The pressure was reduced to vacuum
level of 1 × 10−3 Pa using a dry scroll and turbomolecular pumps. The deposition surface
was placed 30 cm above the crucible. The crucible consisted of a stainless plate containing
the TPB, a resistive heater, carbon sheets to improve the thermal uniformity, and a platinum
resistance thermometer installed between the stainless plate and heater. The TPB deposition
mass at the height of the deposition surface was measured by QCM sensors (QSET-5P-H,
Tamadevice Co., Ltd), which detect nanogram-to-microgram mass changes on the surfaces
of the sensor electrodes.

Fig. 1
Image (left) and scheme (right) of TPB evaporation system. The pressure in the
vacuum vessel is lower than 1 × 10−3 Pa. QCM sensors measure the deposition mass of TPB
at the height of the deposition surface.

To initiate the evaporation procedure, the vessel was evacuated until its inner pressure
reached approximately 1 × 10−3 Pa. Next, the heater voltage was set to 35 V for the ﬁrst
15 min, followed by 30 V to prevent TPB degeneration. The TPB was heated until it was
completely evaporated from the crucible. Fig. 2 shows the temporal parameter changes
recorded while heating the TPB. The behaviors of these parameters were reproducible at
the same heater voltage, aﬃrming the reproducibility of the TPB coating on the evaporation
system. During the evaporation, we also conﬁrmed the evaporation result by measuring the
deposition mass of TPB using the QCM sensor.

Fig. 2
Environmental parameters while heating the TPB: heater voltage (left), crucible
temperature (left center), inner pressure (right center), and TPB deposition mass (right).
The horizontal axis indicates the heating time.

In this system, the TPB deposition mass on the substrate depends on the TPB mass placed
in the crucible. Fig. 3 correlates the amount of TPB in the crucible with the deposition mass
measured by the QCM sensor placed 7 cm away from the center of the evaporation surface.
The red dashed line in Fig. 3 is the TPB deposition mass estimated by assuming that the
TPB spreads evenly over the hemisphere from its respective position in the crucible. The
actual deposition mass followed the expected evaporation mass and was a strongly linear
function of mass in the crucible. Moreover, the deposition mass was uniform, varying by less
than 10% within a 7-cm radius from the center axis of the system.

and expected from the geometry of the evaporation system, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the surface conditions of diﬀerent TPB deposition masses on acrylic disks.
These images were taken by a polarizing microscope. The coating with an approximate den-
sity of 2 µg/cm2 presented evenly distributed kernels which have relatively high luminance
(high polarization). At higher deposition masses, the coating developed a crystalline struc-
ture. The deposition thickness of TPB was measured using a stylus proﬁlometer (Dektac 6M,
ULVAC). Assuming a close-packed structure with TPB molecular density of 1.079 g/cm3,
the total amount of TPB coating was calculated as 32 µg/cm2 (= 0.3 [µm] × 1.079 [g/cm3]),
while the actual TPB mass, measured by QCM sensor, was 2 µg/cm2. Comparing these two
values, the ﬁlling rate was expected to be approximately 6%. The rate got increased with
more TPB deposition mass (12% at 15 µg/cm2 and 18% at 25 µg/cm2).

2.2. Optical validation of TPB coating

Fig. 5 shows the apparatus for measuring the wavelength-shifting eﬃciency and transmit-
tance of the TPB coating. The validation samples were six acrylic disks (diameter = 7 cm,
thickness = 3 mm) with diﬀerent TPB densities (0 – 35 µg/cm2). A PMT was installed
on the non-coated side of each acrylic disk, and a cylinder was installed on the opposite
(coated) side of each disk for mounting the light sources. In the wavelength-shifting eﬃ-
ciency measurement, the gas Ar (GAr) scintillations were induced by α−particles emitted
from a 241Am source mounted on the cylinder. The purity of the GAr was maintained by a
continuous ﬂow of GAr into the cylinder. The PMT detected the converted GAr light pass-
ing through the TPB coating and acrylic disk. In the transmittance measurements, the light
source was a pulsed LED with a width of ten ns. The LED emitted blue light resembling
the TPB-converted blue light.

Fig. 6 shows the measured wavelength-shifting eﬃciencies (blue circles) and transmittances
(red squares) of the six samples. The wavelength-shifting eﬃciency was determined as the
average number of photoelectrons from the GAr normalized by the highest deposition mass
of TPB (the absolute values are not reported). Meanwhile, the transmittance was determined
as the peak PMT signal of the LED light normalized by that of the sample without TPB.
The wavelength-shifting eﬃciency increased with deposition mass and saturated above 25
µg/cm2. In contrast, the transmittance decreased with deposition mass but remained around
80%, even in the saturation region of wavelength-shifting eﬃciency.

Fig. 5
Systems for measuring wavelength-shifting eﬃciency with the GAr scintillation
induced by α−particles emitted from 241Am (left) and transmittance under a blue LED
(right). Measurements were performed on six acrylic disk samples deposited with TPB at
diﬀerent densities (0 to 35 µg/cm2).

In addition, we measured the light yield using a single-phase LAr detector (the details
are provided in [9]). The LAr detector consisted of a polytetraﬂuoroethylene sleeve (as the
main structure), a reﬂector foil (3M, enhanced specular reﬂector (ESR)), and two PMTs
(Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., R11065) with a quantum eﬃciency of approximately 30% for
TPB-converted blue light. The TPB coating density on the PMT windows was adjusted to
the minimum amount (30 µg/cm2) while maximizing wavelength shifting eﬃciency and to
avoid reducing the transmittance of converted light. The TPB coating density on the ESR
was higher (42 µg/cm2) than PMT windows because of the irrelevance of the transmittance.
The right panel of Fig. 6 presents the spectra of the photons observed with a 22Na gamma-ray
source. After adjusting the deposition mass of TPB, the light yield of the 511-keV gamma
rays emitted from 22Na was 12.8 ± 0.3 p.e./keVee. Considering the scintillation yield of
LAr (41 photons/keV [10]), the light yield was limited mainly by the quantum eﬃciency of
PMTs (30%). From this measurement, we conﬁrmed the optimality of the TPB evaporation
technique.

3. Low-temperature tolerance test of single-chip TSV-MPPC

Implementing the higher-sensitive photosensor is essential to improve the light yield of the
LAr scintillation detector. Therefore, the operability of the TSV-MPPC, which has a high
PDE, was evaluated on the apparatus shown in Fig. 7. This test was similar to that reported
in reference [11]. The light sources were the LAr scintillations induced by α-particles emitted
from 241Am (5.5 MeV) and a blue LED with a pulse width of ten ns. The pulse-generator
provided the driving voltage of the LED and the data acquisition trigger for the LED calibra-
tion data. The average light yield of the LED observed by the MPPC was tuned to less than
one photon per pulse. The MPPC in this test was a single-chip TSV–MPPC (Hamamatsu
Photonics K.K., S13360-6050VE) with a gain of 1.7 × 106 at the recommended bias voltage
[12]. It was 6 × 6 mm in size and 50 µm pixel pitch. The TSV–MPPC window (placed 1.5
cm above the 241Am source) was covered by a 30.6 µg/cm2 TPB coating. During the low-
temperature tolerance test, the apparatus was all immersed in LAr. The MPPC driver kit
(Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., C12332) supplied the MPPC bias voltage and ampliﬁed the
signal (the signal ampliﬁcation gain Gamp was 10.9 ± 0.1). The MPPC signal was digitized
by a ﬂash analog-to-digital converter (Struck, SIS3316) with a 250 MHz sampling rate and
was recorded as a waveform.

Fig. 7 Apparatus of the low-temperature tolerance test. The single-chip TSV–MPPC was
1.5 cm above the 241Am source of the LAr scintillation light. The LAr scintillation light was
detected through the TSV–MPPC window coated with TPB(30.6 µg/cm2). The average
light yield of the LED observed by the MPPC was tuned to less than one photon per pulse.
The apparatus was immersed in LAr during the test.

The TSV–MPPC was calibrated using the LED data. The left plot of Fig. 8 shows the
charge distribution obtained at an MPPC bias voltage of 44.5 V. The signal charge was the
integrated value of a waveform over the range [−20 ns, +400 ns], based on the timing of the
LED pulses. The ﬁrst and second peaks in the charge distribution corresponded to pedestal
and few-pixel-hits events, respectively. The MPPC gain was obtained by ﬁtting the charge
distribution to the following function:

f = Eventall × BinWidth ×

(1)

{ P(0; µ) × Gaus(q; Qped, σped)
+ (1 − X)P(1; µ) × Gaus(q; Qped + QGain, qσ2

SP P )

+

n=2

AnP(n; µ) × Gaus(q; Qped + n × QGain, qσ2

6/13

where P(n; µ) is a Poisson distribution with mean µ, Gaus(q; Q, σ) is a Gaussian distribution
with mean Q and standard deviation σ, Eventall is the total number of events, BinWidth is
the bin width of the histogram, Qped and σped respectively are a Gaussian mean value and
standard deviation of the pedestal, σSP P is standard deviation of the single photon pulse,
QGain is the diﬀerence in charge between adjacent peaks corresponding to the MPPC gain,
X is the probability occuring crosstalk and after-pulses, and An is the scale value of n-th
(n > 1) Gaussian. The ﬁtted parameters were µ, Qped, σped, σSP P , QGain, X, and An. The
center and right plots of Fig. 8 show the ﬁtting results of the MPPC gain (GM P P C) and
the number of pixel hits per photoelectron (Npix), respectively. The gain was calculated as
GM P P C = QGain/(e × Gamp) at nine bias voltage (Vbias) points, where e is the elementary
charge. The red line was ﬁtted to the linear function GM P P C = k × Vov = k × (Vbias − Vbd)
where Vov and Vbd are the overvoltages and breakdown voltage, respectively. We conﬁrmed
that the gain increased linearly with bias voltage, and was roughly consistent with the
speciﬁcation value at Vov = 3 V (GM P P C = (2.04 ± 0.02) × 106).

The output signal corresponding to one photon from MPPC exceeded the gain because
it was interfered with crosstalk and after-pulses. Therefore, the MPPC signal charge must
be corrected for estimating the observed number of photons. The correction factor is Npix,
determined as Npix = QLED/(QGain × µ), where QLED is the average charge obtained from
the LED light data. By deﬁnition, Npix corresponds to the number of pixel hits per single-
photon detection. In the right plot of Fig. 8, the Npix was determined at each overvoltage.
Note that Npix was a nonlinearly increasing function of MPPC overvoltage and was well
ﬁtted to f = 1 + p0 × V p1

ov (red curve).

Fig. 8 Charge distribution of the LED light (left), and the results of gain (center) and Npix
(right) estimated from the charge-distribution ﬁtting. The red lines are the ﬁtting function.
These parameters indicate that the TSV–MPPC preserves its well-known features even at
the LAr temperature (87 K).

The left and center panels of Fig. 9 display the charge distribution of the 241Am data
and the average waveform of the events around the peak of the 241Am α-particles, respec-
tively. The lifetime of the average waveform was consistent with the slow component of
LAr scintillations (τslow = 1.6 µs [3]). The signal charge was obtained by integrating the
waveform over the temporal range t = [−1 µs, +20 µs]. The PDE was calculated as
P DE = QAm/(QGain × Npix × Nexp) where QAm is the mean charge obtained by ﬁtting the
241Am peak with a single Gaussian function, the gain and Npix were respectively obtained

7/13

as the ﬁtting results of the center and right plots of Fig. 8, and Nexp is the expected number
of photons reaching the MPPC surface. Nexp was calculated from the following assumptions;
the distance between the MPPC surface and the 241Am source (1.5 ± 0.05 cm), the LAr
scintillation emission yield for α particles (27.5 eV/photon [13]), and the wavelength-shifting
eﬃciency of the TPB coating (100%). It was further assumed that photon emission from
TPB was uniformly isotropic and that the MPPC detected half the photons converted by
TPB. The right panel of Fig. 9 plots the PDE of the TPB-converted LAr scintillation light
as a function of MPPC overvoltage. Uncertainty in the PDE was due to ﬁtting errors in gain,
Npix, and QAm, and by misalignment of the distance between the 241Am and the MPPC
surface. The PDE of the TSV–MPPC was approximately 40% and 50% at Vov = 3 and 5 V,
respectively. The results conﬁrmed that the TSV–MPPC operates in the LAr environment
and detects the TPB-converted visible light with higher eﬃciency compared to PMTs.

uncertainties in the measurements.

4. Demonstration of LAr detector using TSV–MPPC Arrays
4.1. Readout Printed Circuit Board of TSV–MPPC array

The basic characteristics were measured using single-chip TSV-MPPC as shown in section 3,
moreover, we demonstrated the operability of the LAr detector using 4 × 4 array-type TSV-
MPPC because of the necessity of a larger light-detection coverage for practical usage. The
TSV–MPPC array using this study was a 4 × 4 assemblage of TSV–MPPC chips (Hama-
matsu Photonics K.K., S13361-60**AE-04, ** is the pixel size (”50” or ”75”) [14]), which
provides a suﬃcient light-detection area. The array was 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 in area and the bot-
tom of the sensor was equipped with two electrical connectors. As shown in Fig. 10, the
readout board was a double-sided printed circuit board (PCB) with dimensions of 50.5 mm
× 80.5 mm × 1.6 mm. Four (2-column×2-row) TSV–MPPC arrays were installed on the
PCB and the connectors (SAMTEC, ST4-40-1.00-L-D-P-TR) were spaced by 0.5 mm to
avoid inter-connector interferences at LAr temperature. To avoid proliferating the number
of readout channels, four independent MPPC chips (1-column×4-row) were merged by a

8/13

connection circuit conﬁgured on the readout PCB. The left panel of Fig. 11 shows the con-
nection circuit developed in the µ → eγ (MEG) experiment [15]. Coupling capacitors (100
nF) were interposed between neighboring MPPCs, and resistances (1.0 kΩ) were connected
perpendicular to the line of connected MPPCs and capacitors. As the MPPC signal was
transmitted through the series connection, its lifetime decreased with increasing number of
connections. In contrast, the MPPC bias voltage was supplied as a parallel connection, so
was independent of number of MPPC connections. The right panel of Fig. 11 compares the
average waveforms of the signals obtained from single-chip and connected TSV–MPPCs,
respectively, by laser light at room temperature. The lifetime of the signal was shorter in the
connected TSV–MPPC than in the single-chip TSV–MPPC. Moreover, as two high voltage
(HV) lines were merged into one line at the readout PCB, one HV line operated two signal
channels (i.e., 8 MPPC chips). In this conﬁguration, 64 TSV–MPPC chips were driven by
eight HV lines and 16 signal lines were extracted from the PCB through a ﬂexible ﬂat cable
(FFC).

4.2. LAr scintillation detector using TSV–MPPC arrays

Fig. 12 shows the single-phase LAr scintillation detector constructed by TSV–MPPC arrays.
A cube ﬁducial volume, with 5-cm edges, composed of the volumes of the ESR and Telon
tape was installed with eight TSV–MPPC arrays (two readout PCBs, 32 signal channels)
on its two facing sides. To examine the eﬀect of varying the pixel size, we used four MPPC
arrays with a pixel pitch of 50 µm on one side and four MPPC arrays with a pixel pitch of
75 µm on the other side. The ESR (40 µg/cm2) and the windows of the MPPC arrays (30
µg/cm2) were coated with TPB. Gamma rays (59.5 keV) were emitted from a 241Am source
installed above the MPPC detector. The MPPC bias voltage was supplied by an MPPC
driver kit (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., C12332). To reduce the numbers of feedthroughs
and cables, the HV line was divided into eight sublines within the LAr vessel. The signal
from the MPPC exited the LAr vessel through a commercial D-sub feedthrough. The MPPC
signal was passed through a high-pass ﬁlter at room temperature and digitized by the ﬂash
ADC (Struck SIS3316).

Fig. 12

and Teﬂon tape) is enclosed within sides of 5 cm. Eight TSV–MPPC arrays (two readout
PCBs) are installed on the two facing sides. TPB is coated on the ESR (40 µg/cm2) and
the windows of MPPC arrays (30 µg/cm2).

Fig. 13 shows the waveforms of the LAr scintillation events detected by each channel. All
32 channels detected the LAr scintillation light, the waveforms of the MPPCs with pixel
pitches of 75 and 50 µm (hereafter referred as to 75U and 50U) are displayed in red (left)
and blue (right), respectively. The gamma-ray emitted from 241Am (59.5 keV) events peaked
by integrating the waveform over the temporal range [−20 ns, +1 µs] based on the photon
arrival times as shown in Fig. 14. The charges were summed over the 75U or 50U channels
without any scaling.

4.3. Understanding waveforms of events caused by 241Am gamma rays
The left panel of Fig. 15 shows the average waveforms of the events around 241Am gamma-
ray peak for the 75U channels. The waveforms were aﬀected by undershooting and electrical

environment. The red and blue waveforms were obtained at diﬀerent pixel pitches of the
MPPC (75U and 50U, respectively). The LAr scintillation signals were read from all channels
in the detector.

crosstalk caused by the HV connections and D-sub feedthroughs. Therefore, to explain the
signal waveform obtained by the detector, we also ﬁtted the waveform to the convolution of
the waveforms of the LAr signal template and the MPPC signal template. MPPC templates
were obtained using a laser with a pulse width of several ns. The right panel of Fig. 15
shows template waveforms corresponding to 75U MPPC. The LAr template waveform was
obtained by convolving a Gaussian function and two exponential functions with diﬀerent time
constants (a LAr slow component with a time constant of 1.6 µs and a LAr fast component
with a time constant of 7 ns [3]). The ratio of exponential functions with the slow and fast
components is a ﬁtting parameter corresponding to the PSD. Other ﬁtting parameters are the
photon arriving time t0, and the signal scales of 75U and 50U. The ﬁtting was simultaneously
applied to the integral waveforms at the 75U and 50U channels. After ﬁtting, the PSD value
(0.68 ± 0.006) was consistent with that of the ER events detected using the PMT [9].

5. Conclusions

The number of photons observed at a LAr detector depends on the wavelength-shifting
eﬃciency of TPB and the PDE of the photosensors. We optimized the TPB evaporation
technique and evaluated the low-temperature tolerance of TSV–MPPC with high PDE. The
TPB coating was deposited on the substrate using a well-controlled vacuum evaporation
system. We achieved high light-collection eﬃciency (12.8 ± 0.3 p.e./keVee) from a PMT–LAr
detector with the optimized TPB coating on the inner surface (PMT windows: 30 µg/cm2,
another surface: 40 µg/cm2). We also conﬁrmed that at LAr temperature, the TSV–MPPC
operated with higher detection eﬃciency (>50%) compared to PMTs (<30%). The TSV–
MPPCs in the LAr detector successfully detected LAr scintillation events. Implementing the
TSV–MPPCs can increase the light yield to approximately 20 p.e./keVee (12.8 p.e./keVee ×
50%/30%). In future work, we will solve the electrical crosstalk and undershoot problems,
and hence discuss the absolute values of the photons and the PSD power observed by the
TSV–MPPC LAr detector.
