ABSTRACT

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are often associated with coronal dimmings, i.e. transient dark regions that are most
distinctly observed in Extreme Ultra-violet (EUV) wavelengths. Using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data,
we apply Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM) diagnostics to study the plasma characteristics of six coronal dimming
events. In the core dimming region, we ﬁnd a steep and impulsive decrease of density with values up to 50–70%. Five
of the events also reveal an associated drop in temperature of 5–25%. The secondary dimming regions also show a
distinct decrease in density, but less strong, decreasing by 10–45%. In both the core and the secondary dimming the
density changes are much larger than the temperature changes, conﬁrming that the dimming regions are mainly caused
by plasma evacuation. In the core dimming, the plasma density reduces rapidly within the ﬁrst 20–30 min after the
ﬂare start, and does not recover for at least 10 hrs later, whereas the secondary dimming tends to be more gradual
and starts to replenish after 1–2 hrs. The pre-event temperatures are higher in the core dimming (1.7–2.6 MK) than
in the secondary dimming regions (1.6–2.0 MK). Both core and secondary dimmings are best observed in the AIA
211 ˚A and 193 ˚A ﬁlters. These ﬁndings suggest that the core dimming corresponds to the footpoints of the erupting
ﬂux rope rooted in the AR, while the secondary dimming represents plasma from overlying coronal structures that
expand during the CME eruption.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions on the Sun often associated with ﬂares (Harrison 1995;
Zhou et al. 2003; Compagnino et al. 2017). Substantial amounts of energy, plasma and magnetic ﬁeld are released
into the interplanetary medium during such ejections (Vourlidas et al. 2000; Webb & Howard 2012). Being the main
drivers of severe space weather disturbances (Schwenn et al. 2005; Lugaz et al. 2016; Riley et al. 2018), CMEs are
of high relevance for solar as well as space weather research and predictions (e.g. Schwenn 2006; Gopalswamy 2009;
Howard 2014; Green et al. 2018).

CMEs originating from regions located centrally on the solar disk are most likely to be directed towards Earth
(St. Cyr et al. 2000). However, they are diﬃcult to observe in the Thomson-scattered white light by coronagraphs
on-board spacecraft in the Sun-Earth line, since their propagation direction is far away from the plane of sky, and the
measurements may be strongly aﬀected by projection eﬀects (e.g. Gopalswamy et al. 2000). For these reasons, there
is also a need for indirect means of studying the early evolution of Earth-directed CMEs. Hansen et al. (1974) were
the ﬁrst to report intensity ‘dimmings’ in coronameter images from Mauna Loa occurring simultaneously with CMEs.
They have an appearance similar to coronal holes and are thus also referred to as ‘transient coronal holes’ (Rust 1983;
Hewish et al. 1985). A great advance in observing coronal dimmings associated with CMEs has been made with the
advent of the Yohkoh/Soft X-Ray Telescope and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope (SoHO/EIT) (Hudson et al. 1996; Sterling & Hudson 1997; Zarro et al. 1999; Thompson et al. 2000). Since
then, many case studies and statistical studies were performed using imaging at EUV and SXR wavelengths, in order
to better understand the physics of coronal dimmings and how they relate to the CME evolution (e.g. Zhukov &
Auch`ere 2004; Reinard & Biesecker 2008; Bewsher et al. 2008).

Coronal dimmings occur in association with the early eruption phase of CMEs. It is believed that such dimmings
are a consequence of density decrease in the low corona due to mass carried out by the CME (Hudson et al. 1998;
Mason et al. 2014). Coronal dimming regions can be used as indirect means to estimate the source location, width
and mass of CMEs (Harrison et al. 2003; Aschwanden 2016). While observations of CMEs originating from regions
close to the center of the solar disk are subject to substantial projection eﬀects, the coronal dimming region is most
clearly discernible here making them a good proxy for studying Earth-directed CMEs.

Coronal dimmings can be diﬀerentiated into two types: core and secondary dimmings. The core dimmings are
localized regions that occur in pairs on opposite sides of the source active region, and are rooted in opposite magnetic
polarities. They are interpreted as a signature of the footpoints of the erupting ﬂux rope (Sterling & Hudson 1997;
Webb et al. 2000). In contrast, secondary dimmings appear more shallow, diﬀuse and widespread. They are assumed
to be caused by the expansion of the overall CME structure formed, and thus to correspond to the spatial extent of
the CME observed in coronagraph data (Mandrini et al. 2007).

Several spectroscopic results support the presence of outﬂowing plasma in the dimming regions (Harra & Sterling
2001; Harra et al. 2007; Miklenic et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2012) with velocities decreasing with time (Jin et al. 2009) and
prevalent thermal line broadening (McIntosh 2009; Chen et al. 2010). Density decrease of 35–40% within the dimming
regions (Cheng et al. 2012) and plasma ﬂows to replenish it (Landi et al. 2012) have been identiﬁed using Diﬀerential
Emission Measure (DEM) analysis.

In this paper, we study the plasma characteristics of coronal dimmings using DEM analysis. For this purpose, we
selected six dimming events associated with CME/ﬂare events of diﬀerent speeds and ﬂare classes for detailed case
studies. The plasma evolution in the core and the secondary dimming regions are studied in high cadence over a period
of 12 hrs. The paper is organized as follows, in Section 2 we describe our data and methods of analysis. The results
are presented in Section 3 and discussed in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we give the summary and conclusions of this
work.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

The six EUV ﬁlters of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) instrument on-board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012) are sensitive to plasma over a wide temperature range from ≈105
to above 107 K which facilitates the use of their data for the purpose of DEM reconstruction. Many DEM codes
have been developed in the past years to use with AIA data (Aschwanden et al. 2013; Hannah & Kontar 2012, 2013;
Plowman et al. 2013; Cheung et al. 2015). For this work the code developed by Hannah & Kontar (2013) has been used,
henceforth referred to as HK code. The HK code uses regularized inversion to reconstruct a DEM from broad/narrow

band ﬁlter observations using the equation

where Iﬁlter is the intensity measured in a particular ﬁlter, Rﬁlter(T ) is the temperature response function of the
instrument, and φ(T ) is the required DEM.

For our analysis, we ﬁrst binned the AIA images to a size of 512 pixels × 512 pixels (from the original images of
4096 × 4096) while conserving ﬂux and then cut to a sub-map around the AR where the dimming could be clearly
seen. The binning increases the signal to noise ratio, which is especially relevant in the AIA channels sensitive to
hotter plasma where the counts are relatively low (94 and 131 ˚A), thus improving the DEMs derived. From the DEM
maps, we then calculated for each rebinned pixel the emission measure (EM), the DEM weighted average temperature
( ¯T ) and plasma density (¯n) using the following expressions:

where h is the distance along the line-of-sight (LOS). For this study we have used h=60 Mm corresponding to the
coronal scale height for a temperature of about 1 MK (see also Vanninathan et al. 2015). Note that each of our
rebinned pixels corresponds to 8 × 8 original AIA pixels, i.e. covers a ﬁeld of about 4(cid:48)(cid:48) × 4(cid:48)(cid:48) on the solar disk.

For the current work we have selected six coronal dimming events, which were observed against the solar disk, for
detailed case study. We made sure that the list represented events associated with ﬂares of diﬀerent classes, ranging
from C3 to X2 (and located within 30◦ from the central meridian), and CMEs of diﬀerent speeds, ranging from ≈400–
1100 km s−1. Four of the events are associated with an EUV wave (Nitta et al. 2013), indicating the presence of large
amplitude magnetosonic waves initiated by the impulsive lateral CME expansion (e.g. Kienreich et al. 2009; Patsourakos
& Vourlidas 2009; Veronig et al. 2010; Long et al. 2017). The events selected along with information on the associated
ﬂare, CME and EUV wave are summarized in Table 1. The CME speed given is the linear speed derived in the LASCO
ﬁeld-of-view, as listed in the LASCO/SOHO CME catalogue (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/), the EUV
wave speeds are from the EUV wave catalogue compiled in Nitta et al. (2013).

Using the HK code we have constructed DEM maps for all the selected events. EM, density and temperature
maps were derived from the DEMs as given in Equations 2–4. In addition, we derived base-ratio maps for each of

the parameters using a pre-event image (30 min before the ﬂare) as the base image. These maps were then used to
characterize the plasma properties in the dimming region and their changes during the event. The diﬀerences between
the core and secondary dimmings were studied and compared for all the events. Below we demonstrate our analysis
in detail on two sample events: the 06 September 2011 event which was associated with the strongest ﬂare in our
list and a CME and EUV wave with high speed, and the event on 14 March 2012 which was associated with a slow
CME. Thereafter, we summarize the main results obtained for the other four events, and add the related ﬁgures in
the Appendix.

3.1. Event on 06 September 2011

The coronal dimming event of 06 September 2011 was associated with a X2.1 class ﬂare in NOAA Active Region
11283, peaking at 22:12 UT, and a CME with a linear speed of 575 km s−1 in LASCO data.1 There was also a strong
EUV wave with a speed of 1250 km s−1 associated with this event, studied in detail in Dissauer et al. (2016).

To identify the core and secondary dimming regions, we use the aglorithm described in Dissauer et al. (2018). The
dimming detection is based on thresholding and region growing techniques applied to sequences of logarithmic base-
ratio images. To identify locations of potential core dimmings within the overall dimming detections, the pixels with
the smallest intensities reached over the whole event duration are extracted from so-called minimum intensity maps.
The results from the dimming detection are shown in Figure 1. Here, the time evolution of the dimming region in the
AIA 211 ˚A channel (left panels), the corresponding logarithmically scaled base-ratio images (middle panels) as well as
the dimming regions detected (right panels) are shown. Red (yellow) colors indicate the secondary (core) dimming
regions identiﬁed. The ﬁrst row in the image represents the state of the corona before the start of the event. Hence
there is no dimming present yet. The second row shows the time step soon after the peak in the associated ﬂare
emission, where the dimming has already started to form. The third row shows an evolved dimming, with the number
of dimming pixels increasing. This is close to the time step when the dimming area was at its maximum. In the last
row, which is about 4 hrs after the start of the associated ﬂare, we see that the number of pixels detected as dimming
has reduced and the area of the dimming region has already shrunk, indicating that the corona has started to be
replenished.

We also compared the detected dimming region with photospheric magnetic ﬁeld maps as shown in Figure 2. These
are LOS magnetic ﬁeld data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard SDO.
The core dimming regions (left panel) are localized, and do not show much expansion through the progress of the
event. They occur in pairs of opposite polarity within the active region where the magnetic ﬁeld density is high. This
scenario conforms to the interpretation that these regions mark the footpoints of the erupting ﬂux rope (Sterling &
Hudson 1997; Mandrini et al. 2005). The secondary dimming region (right panel), on the other hand, ﬁrst expands,
reaches a maximum and thereafter shrinks with time, and is located predominantly in regions of weak magnetic ﬁelds.
Using the HK code we constructed DEM maps from which we were able to derive EM, density and temperature
maps. These maps are shown in Figure 3 together with the corresponding images from the AIA 211 ˚A ﬁlter. The ﬁrst
panel under EM is replaced with magnetic ﬁeld data which can give us some information about the magnetic structure
within the dimming region. We can see that as the dimming evolves, there is a signiﬁcant decrease in EM and density.
There is also a decrease observed in the temperature maps but this is not as substantial as the other quantities.

To better see the changes in the derived quantities, we use base-ratio maps for enhancement. These images are
shown in Figure 4. Each panel in Figure 4 corresponds to the same panel in Figure 3. From the dimming evolution
in Figure 4 we clearly see a decrease in EM and density within the dimming region. The changes in these quantities
closely reﬂect the changes seen in the AIA 211 ˚A channel. On the other hand, the temperature maps show a decrease
only in certain small regions. In many pixels, especially those around the region of the strong X2.1 ﬂare, we see an
increase in temperature. This eﬀect in the temperature reconstruction from the DEMs most probably arises from
strong scattered light in these pixels, caused by the bright ﬂaring regions.

For detailed analysis we selected subregions within the core and secondary dimming and checked the shape of the
DEM curves. The evolution of these DEM proﬁles are shown in Figure 5. Before the dimming region is formed,
the DEMs in both the regions are quite high. The core dimming shows a double peak at log T [K] = 6.20 and
log T [K] = 6.45, suggesting that plasma at quiet coronal temperatures as well as plasma at active region temperatures
is included in the LOS of the selected core dimming region. The secondary dimming shows one broad peak at

1 We note that in this event the linear speed of the CME as observed by STEREO-A (EUVI-COR1-COR2) on the limb (v = 990 km s−1)

is much larger than the LASCO plane-of-sky speed (v = 575 km s−1), indicative of strong projection eﬀects (Dissauer et al. 2016).

coded, see legend) are superimposed. The timesteps are the same as in Figure 1.

log T [K] = 6.25, indicative that most plasma along the LOS is at typical quiet coronal temperatures. As the dimming
evolves, we see that the overall DEM curve diminishes drastically in both the regions. This indicates strong reduction
of emission along the LOS due to depletion of plasma. In the core dimming region, it is noticeable, that the peak
at log T [K] = 6.45 fully vanishes, indicating that active regions loops are ejected. In the secondary dimming region
one can clearly see that not only the overall DEM distribution strongly reduces, but also that the peak moves to
smaller temperatures, indicating plasma cooling associated with the density decrease (as is expected from adiabatic
expansion).

To further study the evolution in the core and secondary dimming regions we derive lightcurves from the six EUV
channels of AIA in the selected subregions. We study the evolution of the dimming region using the median of the
lightcurves of pixels within the subregion. The selected regions of interest for core dimming (green) and secondary
dimming (red) are marked in Figure 4, left. The lightcurves, normalized to the pre-event value for each ﬁlter, are
plotted in Figure 6 along with the absolute deviation. They give direct evidence on the percentage change of the
emission with respect to the state before the dimming. We can see from Figure 6 that in the core dimming region, all
AIA channels show a strong reduction in intensity (up to about 75% decrease) immediately after the ﬂare. We see the
steepest changes within the ﬁrst 10 min after the ﬂare start. It then takes 20 more minutes to reach a minimum. The
lightcurves do not recover from the decrease for at least the next (cid:38)10 hrs covered by our analysis.

Within the secondary dimming region, the strongest decrease of ≈60–70% is seen in the 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A and 335 ˚A
channels. The other channels show a lesser decrease of ≈30–50%. The secondary dimming region is not as impulsive
as the core dimming region. The lightcurves are seen to decrease and reach a minimum after about 30 min. However,
unlike the core dimming region which stays at strongly reduced levels for the following (cid:38)10 hrs, the intensity in the
secondary dimming begins to increase again within 10–30 min after reaching its minimum.

We also studied the changes in the derived plasma parameters in a similar way and the results are shown in Figure 7.
The EM and density in both the regions behave similar to the EUV lightcurves i.e. they drop abruptly after the ﬂare

in the dimming pixels. In the core dimming region there is a distinct density drop of 58% and temperature drop of
19%. The secondary dimming region shows lesser decrease than the core dimming region, same as we saw in the AIA
lightcurves. There is a 40% decrease in density and a 8% decrease in temperature. The larger decrease in density in
both the core and secondary dimming regions as compared to the decrease in temperature suggests that the dimming
regions are mainly formed by plasma evacuation rather than by temperature changes.

3.2. Event on 14 March 2012

11

The dimming event of 14 March 2012 was associated with an M2.8 class ﬂare that occurred in NOAA Active Region
11432 (GOES peak at 15:08 UT) and a CME with a speed of speed 411 km s−1, which is the slowest CME in our
selection. It also had a moderate EUV wave of speed 485 km s−1 associated with it.

In Figure 8 we show the time evolution of the dimming in AIA 211 ˚A together with the EM, density and temperature
maps. We see a clear coronal dimming formed, which is distinguishable from EM and density images but in the
temperature images this region is partly obscured by the emission from the ﬂare.

The DEM curves for this event are shown in Figure 9. We see that the curves peak at around log T [K] = 6.2 in
both the secondary and core dimming regions. As the dimming evolves, the DEM curves show a distinct decrease.
In particular in the core dimming region, the overall DEM distribution drastically diminishes, indicating that a large
portion of the emitting plasma along the LOS is removed. The pre-event peak values of the DEM curves (T = 1.7
MK) indicate that most of the plasma that is removed is at quiet coronal temperatures.

The AIA lightcurves in Figure 10 show a similar trend as in the event on 06 September 2011. In these lightcurves,
we ﬁrst see a peak due to the ﬂare. In the core dimming region, we see immediately after this peak a decrease of more
than 80% in the lightcurves from all the AIA channels; the largest drop (90%) is observed in the AIA 193 ˚A ﬁlter.
This drastic decrease occurs within the ﬁrst 30 min after the ﬂare start, and the lightcurves do not recover for at least
the next 10 hrs. The changes in the secondary dimming region evolve much slower than the core dimming region. The
lightcurves reduce gradually, and take more than 2 hrs to reach a minimum. Thereafter, they start to slowly rise again
and return to background levels. For this region, the maximum intensity drop of 54% is observed in the AIA 193 ˚A
channel.

The time evolution of the plasma parameters is shown in Figure 11. In the core dimming region, we observe a steep
gradient in the density and temperature evolution for about 20 min, where the density decreases by 64% and the
temperature by 9%. There is very little variation in these values for the next 10 hrs. Within the secondary dimming
region, the plasma parameters take more than 2 hrs to reach their minimum. The density decreases by 22%, and after
the minimum is reached eventually starts to climb to reach background levels. The temperature curve does not show
any signiﬁcant decrease from the background levels.

3.3. All other events

Here we brieﬂy discuss also all the other events we have studied (cf. Table 1 ). The corresponding ﬁgures for these

events are given in the Appendix.

The dimming event on 01 August 2010 was associated to a small C3.2 class ﬂare peaking at 07:24 UT from NOAA
Active Region 11092 and a CME with speed of 850 km s−1. An EUV wave was also associated with it, with a speed of
312 km s−1. Figure 12 shows images from the AIA 211 ˚A ﬁlter and the corresponding maps of the plasma parameters
derived, illustrating the evolution of the dimming region. In Figure 13, we show the AIA lightcurves, and in Figure 14
the time evolution of the plasma parameters derived. The strongest density decrease occurs within 10 min after the
ﬂare start, followed by a more gradual further decrease, reaching a maximum drop of 68% about 1 hr after ﬂare
start. The temperature curve shows some ﬂuctuation during the ﬂare time, which we attribute to uncertainties in
the DEM reconstruction. Eventually it shows a steady decrease for about 2 hrs, attaining a maximum drop of 25%.
In the secondary dimming region, the lightcurves evolve slowly and take about 40–60 min to reach a minimum. The
percentage decrease of density and temperature in the secondary dimming region is 31% and 12%, respectively.

The dimming event on 21 June 2011 was associated with a C7.7 class ﬂare from NOAA Active Region 11236 (peak
time 01:22 UT) and a CME of speed 719 km s−1. No EUV wave was associated with the event. Figure 15 shows the
evolution of the dimming region. For this event the dimming region is initially obscured by loops along the LOS. This
is characterized by the prolonged brightness in the AIA lightcurves and plasma parameters at the beginning of the
event (see Figures 16 and 17). The loops ﬁnally open up to reveal a well formed dimming region. The changes in the
core dimming region in this event are more gradual compared to the other events, which is due to the presence of
loops. The density in the core dimming region reaches a minimum of 68%, whereas the temperature shows only a 6%
decrease. In the secondary dimming region, the AIA lightcurves and the plasma parameters show many ﬂuctuations
that we attribute to the presence of loops along the LOS. The temperature curve does not show a clear decrease while
the density curve reaches a minimum of 18%.

The dimming event on 19 January 2012 was associated with an M3.2 class ﬂare peaking at 13:44 UT from NOAA
Active Region 11402. This event was associated with the fastest CME within our event selection, with a speed

Region 11429. This event was associated with a CME of speed 950 km s−1 and an EUV wave of speed 690 km s−1.
Figure 21 shows maps of the AIA 211 ˚A ﬁlter and of the plasma parameters derived, illustrating the evolution of the
dimming region. Lightcurves in the AIA channels and in the plasma parameters are shown in Figures 22 and 23,
respectively.
In this event, the plasma parameters show a rather gradual change. The density decreased by 52%,
reached after about 4 hrs after the ﬂare, while the temperature curve shows almost no decrease. The evolution of the
secondary dimming region is also slow and takes several hours to reach a minimum. The density decreases by 10% but
there is no clear decrease in the temperature curve.

In Tables 2 and 3, we summarize all the results obtained for the plasma parameters as well as for the changes in the

AIA lightcurves for all six events under study.

4. DISCUSSION

15

We have reconstructed DEM maps from SDO/AIA ﬁltergrams for six CME-associated coronal dimming events to
study the plasma characteristics and evolution in both the core and the secondary dimming regions. The most distinct
diﬀerence we ﬁnd is that in the core dimming region the plasma parameters show a much faster and deeper decrease
than in the secondary dimming region, and stay at these low levels for the overall duration of our study. In most
cases, the core dimming region shows the steepest changes within 20–30 min after the ﬂare start, while the secondary
dimming evolution tends to be more gradual and takes longer to reach its minimum (30–90 min). After reaching a
minimum, within the core dimming region, there was not much change in the time evolution of the plasma parameters.
They remained low and showed (almost) no signs of increase for the entire duration of this study ((cid:38)10 hrs after the
ﬂare). This is consistent with the ﬁndings that CMEs may keep their connection to the Sun over days, as is suggested
from measuring bidirectional electron streams at 1AU (e.g., Bothmer et al. 1996). On the other hand, in the secondary
dimming region we observe a gradual increase about 1–2 hrs after the minimum was reached, indicative of replenishment
of these coronal regions with plasma after the CME eruption. These ﬁndings suggest that the core dimming region
corresponds to the footpoints of the erupting ﬂux rope where the magnetic ﬁeld lines open to interplanetary space
enable continuous outﬂow of plasma, preventing the reﬁll of this region, while the secondary dimming corresponds to
overlying ﬁelds higher up in the corona that expand due to the CME eruption.

In Table 2 we have summarized the results of the plasma parameters for all the events. We have calculated the
percentage decrease of the minimum value attained by the plasma parameters as compared to the pre-ﬂare background
for all the events. We have listed the percentage decrease in EM, density and temperature separately for the core
dimming and the secondary dimming regions for all the events. In addition we also list the absolute minimum values
attained by density and temperature for both these regions. We found that within the core dimming region the decrease
in EM is 80–90%, density decrease is 50–70% and temperature decrease is 5–25%. While within the secondary dimming
we found the decrease in EM to be around 20–70%, density decrease around 10–45%; not all cases showed a decrease
in temperature.

From the results summarized in Table 2 we see that for a given event the percentage decrease of each plasma
parameter is signiﬁcantly higher within the core dimming region than in the secondary dimming region. In some cases
the changes within the core dimming region are almost twice more than the changes in the secondary dimming region.
We also notice that for each event, the percentage decrease in temperature is much lower than the decrease in EM
and density, indicating that the main cause of the dimming is plasma evacuation rather than temperature changes.
Comparing the maximum density and temperature drops observed, we ﬁnd that in all cases the temperature decreases
are smaller than would be predicted from adiabatic expansion, T /T0 = (n/n0)γ−1 with γ = 5/3 for a fully ionized
plasma (e.g. Aschwanden 2004).

However, at this stage, it is important to discuss the diﬀerent limitations in the reconstructions of EM, density and
temperature from the DEM analysis. In our analysis we have seen that some events do not reveal a clear temperature
decrease or show strong ﬂuctuations in the temperature evolution curves, even in cases where the reconstructed EM
and density evolution showed a clear and smooth evolution. The estimates of EM and density (see Equations 2, 4)
are determined from the integral over the whole DEM curve reconstructed, whereas the determination of the mean
plasma temperature (see Equation 3) is strongly dependent on the shape of the DEM curve (Cheng et al. 2012). This
explains why the reconstructed EM and density maps and curves are much more robust than the derived temperatures
with regard to problems in the reconstructed DEM curves. Such problems may, e.g., arise due to uncertainties in the
instrument response, due to saturation, blooming eﬀects or scattered light from the bright ﬂaring regions aﬀecting the
selected subegions in some ﬁlters at some time steps. Or, they may also arise, when very diﬀerent structures (e.g.
ﬂare and dimming) are included in the same selected pixel (note that we have binned our maps by 8 × 8 AIA pixels
for better signal-to-noise ratio). In the selection of our subregions in the core and secondary dimmings for detailed
analysis, we tried to avoid areas that are aﬀected by such eﬀects, but we cannot assure this holds for all the AIA
channels during all the time steps. Thus, we caution on those curves that do not show a smooth evolution but strong
ﬂuctuations.

The eﬀects discussed above are much less severe in the pre-event state, i.e. before the dimming and the associated
strong ﬂare emission take place. Comparing the pre-event densities and temperatures in the core and secondary
dimming regions, which characterize the plasma that is later expanding or ejected from this region, we ﬁnd the
following. In the core dimming, the pre-event densities are in the range 6 × 108 to 1.3 × 109 cm−3 and the pre-event
temperatures 1.7–2.6 MK, whereas the corresponding values in the secondary dimming regions are 4 × 108 cm−3 to

all the events. The largest and second largest values of decrease for each type of dimming are highlighted. Green corresponds
to core and red to secondary dimming regions.

7×108 cm−3 and 1.6–2.0 MK, respectively. Systematically, in each event, both the pre-event densities and temperatures
are smaller in the core than in the secondary dimming region. We also note that the event with the highest density
and temperature (06 September 2011) showed a double component in the pre-event DEMs at log T [K] = 6.20 and
log T [K] = 6.45 (cf. Figure 5). The higher temperature component fully disappeared during the dimming, and the
lower temperature component also strongly reduced. This together with the high density derived for the core dimming
region, 1.1 × 109 cm−3, implies that in this event also hot and dense active region loops were ejected from the selected
region in the core dimming region.

In order see in which of the AIA ﬁlters we can observe the dimming most clearly, we also analyzed the time evolution
of the dimming regions in the diﬀerent AIA ﬁlters, and identiﬁed which one reveals the highest percentage decrease
compared to the pre-event intensities. The results for all the events are shown in Table 3. We found that within the
core dimming region the highest decrease occurs in the 211 ˚A and 193 ˚A channels, with values of about 80 to 90%.
For the secondary dimming regions we found that again the 193 ˚A and 211 ˚A ﬁlter reveal the strongest decrease, with
values of about 40 to 75%, but for several events also the 171 ˚A ﬁlter sensitive to cooler plasma shows strong decreases
up to 50%. Other authors have also calculated percentage decrease in dimmings using the EIT 195 ˚A and 171 ˚A ﬁlters
(Chertok & Grechnev 2005; McIntosh et al. 2007). They showed 40–50% decrease in the 195 ˚A and up to 80% in the
171 ˚A ﬁlter.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we use SDO/AIA DEM analysis to study the plasma characteristics and evolution of coronal dimmings
caused by CMEs. The six events under study are associated with CMEs of speeds ranging from 400–1100 km s−1 and
ﬂare classes from C3 to X2. We have constructed DEM maps and derived EM, density and temperature maps to study
the time evolution of each dimming event over a duration of 12 hrs. Particular focus was drawn on the diﬀerences
between the core and the secondary dimming regions. Our main results and related conclusions are the following:

1. For each event, the decrease in density is much larger in the core dimming than in the secondary dimming
region. In both types of dimmings, the decrease in density is consistently more pronounced than the decrease
in temperature. In the core dimming region, we observe reductions in density of 50–70% while the temperature
drops by 5–25%, which is smaller than is expected from adiabatic expansion. In the secondary dimming region
we observe density decreases of 10–45%, but not all events reveal a measurable temperature decrease.

2. In the core dimming region, the main changes in the plasma characteristics occur impulsively over a period of
≈20–30 min after the start of the associated ﬂare. The core dimmings occur in opposite polarity regions, localized
in the active region, and remain evacuated for extended periods of time ((cid:38)10 hrs). The secondary dimmings
are more dispersed and start to recover already after 1–2 hrs indicating replenishment of the corona after the
eruption.

3. In each event, the pre-event densities and temperatures are higher in the core than in the secondary dimming
regions. The pre-event densities in the core dimming are in the range n = 6 × 108 to 1.3 × 109 cm−3 and the
pre-event temperatures T = 1.7 − 2.6 MK, whereas for the secondary dimming regions we obtain n = 4 × 108

to 7 × 108 cm−3 and T = 1.6 − 2.0 MK. These values and systematic diﬀerences indicate that the plasma in the
core dimming region stems from active regions, whereas the consistently lower densities and temperatures in the
secondary dimming regions are indicative of plasma from overlying regions higher in the corona.

4. Both core and secondary dimming regions are best observed in the AIA 211 ˚A and 193 ˚A ﬁlters, with percentage
decreases up to 80–90% in the core dimming and 40–75% in the secondary dimming regions with respect to the
pre-event intensities.

Our results conﬁrm that coronal dimmings associated with CMEs are formed due to plasma evacuation rather than
temperature changes, and thus coronal dimmings provide indeed a valuable alternative means to estimate the mass
ejected by CMEs (e.g. Harrison et al. 2003; Mason et al. 2014; Aschwanden 2016). In addition, we provide further
support of the interpretation that the core dimming regions are formed at the location of the footpoints of the erupting
ﬂux rope. Our ﬁndings that the core dimming regions remain evacuated for (cid:38)10 hrs is indicative of magnetic ﬁeld
lines open to interplanetary space, which enable continuous outﬂow of plasma and preventing the reﬁll of this region
— as it is expected for an erupting ﬂux rope still connected to the Sun (e.g., Temmer et al. 2017). The secondary
dimmings correspond to plasma from higher lying coronal regions that expand during the CME eruption, and start to be
replenished already 1–2 hrs after the start of the event. Finally, we note that the gradual evolution and replenishment
derived for the secondary dimming regions may also bear general implications and characteristic time scales for the
formation of the corona.
