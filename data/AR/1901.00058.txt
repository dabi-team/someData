Abstract

We consider conformally invariant energies W on the group GL+(2) of 2 × 2-matrices with positive
determinant, i.e. W : GL+(2) → R such that

W (AF B) = W (F )

for all A, B ∈ {aR ∈ GL+(2) | a ∈ (0, ∞) , R ∈ SO(2)} ,

where SO(2) denotes the special orthogonal group, and provide an explicit formula for the (notoriously
diﬃcult to compute) quasiconvex envelope of these functions. Our results, which are based on the rep-
resentation W (F ) = h( λ1
) of W in terms of the singular values λ1, λ2 of F , are applied to a number of
λ2
example energies in order to demonstrate the convenience of the eigenvalue-based expression compared
(cid:107)F (cid:107)2
to the more common representation in terms of the distortion K := 1
det F . Special cases of our results
2
can be obtained from earlier works by Astala et al. [6] and Yan [65].

A recent contribution [42] introduced a number of criteria for generalized convexity properties (including
quasiconvexity) of so-called conformally invariant functions (or energies) on the group GL+(2) of 2 × 2-
matrices with positive determinant, i.e. functions W : GL+(2) → R with

W (AF B) = W (F )

for all A, B ∈ CSO(2) ,

(1.1)

where

CSO(2) := R+ · SO(2) = {aR ∈ GL+(2) | a ∈ (0, ∞) , R ∈ SO(2)}

denotes the conformal special orthogonal group.1 This requirement can equivalently be expressed as

W (R1F ) = W (F ) = W (F R2) , W (aF ) = W (F )

for all R1, R2 ∈ SO(2) , a ∈ (0, ∞) ,

(1.2)

i.e. left- and right-invariance under the special orthogonal group SO(2) and invariance under scaling.
In
nonlinear elasticity theory, where F = ∇ϕ represents the so-called deformation gradient of a deformation ϕ,
the former two invariances correspond to the objectivity and isotropy of W , respectively. In this context, an

1 Note that this invariance property needs to be distinguished from the concept of (nearly) conformal energies [36, 63], i.e.
functions W ≥ 0 such that W (F ) = 0 if and only if F ∈ CSO(2), e.g. W (F ) = (cid:107)F (cid:107)2 − 2 det F . Instead of invariances of the
argument, these energies are characterized by a global “potential well” containing the unbounded set CSO(2) and can merely
be considered “conformally invariant in F = 1”.

In a planar minimization problem subject to the homeomorphic boundary condition ϕ|∂Ω = ϕ0, the 2-harmonic Dirichlet

energy I(ϕ) = (cid:82)

2 (cid:107)∇ϕ(cid:107)2 dx is sometimes referred to as a conformal energy as well. Indeed,

and equality holds if and only if ϕ is conformal, due to Hadamard’s inequality and the fact that det ∇ϕ is a null Lagrangian.
However, the energy density W (F ) = 1
2 (cid:107)F (cid:107)2 is neither conformally invariant in the sense of (1.1) nor (nearly) conformal in the
above sense.

energy W satisfying W (aF ) = W (F ) is more commonly known as isochoric, and is often additively coupled
[55, 18] with a volumetric energy term of the form f (det F ) for some convex function f : (0, ∞) → R.

In this contribution, we consider the quasiconvex envelopes of conformally invariant energies on GL+(2).
Based on our previous results, we provide an explicit formula that allows for a direct computation of the
quasiconvex (as well as the rank-one convex and polyconvex) envelope for this class of functions. We also
discuss diﬀerent ways of expressing conformally invariant energies, including representations based on the
F T F , in order to highlight the diﬃculties which arise from
singular values of F , i.e. the eigenvalues of
focusing on the seemingly more simple representation in terms of the distortion function K.

√

Our main result (Theorem 3.3) has been tested against a numerical algorithm for computing the polycon-
vex envelope [14] for a range of parameters, yielding agreement up to computational precision. In two special
cases, we show that our results completely match previous developments of Astala, Iwaniec, and Martin
[6] and Yan [65, 64]. We also present direct ﬁnite element simulations of the microstructure using a trust-
region–multigrid method [19, 56] which show consistent results. In the appendix, we answer two questions
by Adamowicz [1], and discuss a related relaxation result by Dacorogna and Koshigoe [21].

1.1 Conformal and quasiconformal mappings

Energy functions of the form (1.1) are intrinsically linked to conformal geometry and geometric function
theory [6]. A mapping ϕ : Ω → R2 is called conformal if and only if ∇ϕ(x) ∈ CSO(2) on Ω or, equivalently,

∇ϕT ∇ϕ = (det ∇ϕ) · 1 ,

where 1 ∈ GL+(2) denotes the identity matrix.
If R2 is identiﬁed with the complex plane C, then ϕ is
conformal if and only if ϕ : Ω ⊂ C → C is holomorphic and the derivative is non-zero everywhere. Although
the Riemann mapping theorem states that any non-empty, simply connected open planar domain can be
mapped conformally to the unit disc, conformal mappings exhibit aspects of rigidity [25] that make them
In particular, since the Riemann mapping is uniquely
too restrictive for many interesting applications.
determined by prescribing the function value for three points, conformal mappings are not able to satisfy
arbitrary boundary conditions.

A signiﬁcantly larger and more ﬂexible class is given by the so-called quasiconformal mappings, i.e.

functions ϕ : Ω → R2 that satisfy the uniform bound

(cid:107)K(cid:107)∞ := ess sup

x∈Ω

K(∇ϕ(x)) ≤ L

for some L ≥ 1 ,

where K denotes the distortion function [33, 7] or outer distortion [34]

(1.3)

(1.4)

Due to Hadamard’s inequality, K(F ) ≥ 1 for all F ∈ GL+(2). In particular, if (1.3) is satisﬁed with L = 1,
then K(∇ϕ) ≡ 1, which implies that ϕ is conformal.

The classical Gr¨otzsch free boundary value problem [30] (cf. Appendix B) is to ﬁnd and characterize
quasiconformal mappings of rectangles into rectangles that minimize the maximal distortion (cid:107)K(cid:107)∞ and map
faces to corresponding faces, i.e. to solve the minimization problem

(cid:107)K(∇ϕ)(cid:107)∞ → min ,

ϕ : [0, a1] × [0, 1] → [0, a2] × [0, 1] ,
ϕ([0, a1] × {0}) = [0, a2] × {0} , ϕ([0, a1] × {1}) = [0, a2] × {1} ,
ϕ({0} × [0, 1]) = {0} × [0, 1] , ϕ({a1} × [0, 1]) = {a2} × [0, 1] .

(1.5)

A much more involved problem has been solved by Teichm¨uller [61, 2]. The classical Teichm¨uller problem
(cf. Appendix B) is to ﬁnd and characterize quasiconformal solutions to

(cid:107)K(∇ϕ)(cid:107)∞ → min ,

ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Ω; R2) , ϕ(x)|∂B1(0) = x , ϕ(0) = −a

(1.6)

for 0 < a < 1. Computational approaches for calculating extremal quasiconformal mappings (with direct
applications in engineering) are discussed, e.g., in [62]. However, the analytical diﬃculties posed by this
problem also motivate the study of integral generalizations of (1.6), i.e.

(cid:90)

B1(0)

Ψ(K(∇ϕ)) dx → min ,

ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Ω; R2) , ϕ(x)|∂B1(0) = x , ϕ(0) = −a ,

where Ψ : [1, ∞) → [0, ∞) is assumed to be strictly increasing. Further generalizing the domain, boundary
condition and additional constraints, we obtain a more classical problem in the calculus of variations: the
existence and uniqueness of mappings between planar domains with prescribed boundary values that minimize
certain integral functions of K, i.e. the minimization problem

(cid:90)

Ψ(K(∇ϕ)) dx → min ,

ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Ω; R2) , ϕ(cid:12)

(cid:12)∂Ω = ϕ0

(cid:12)
(cid:12)∂Ω

(1.7)

for given Ψ : [1, ∞) → R and ϕ0 : Ω → R2. Since K(aR∇ϕ) = K(∇ϕaR) = K(∇ϕ) for all a > 0 and all
R ∈ SO(2), the distortion function K is conformally invariant, and indeed every conformally invariant energy
W on GL+(2) can be expressed in the form W (F ) = Ψ(K(F )), see [42].

However, the mapping F (cid:55)→ K(F ) is non-convex. Without additional restrictions on Ψ, it is therefore
diﬃcult to establish results regarding the existence or regularity of minimizers. It is generally believed [6,
Conjecture 21.2.1, p. 599] that for “well-behaved” functions Ψ, e.g. if Ψ is smooth, strictly increasing and
convex, any solution2 to the minimization problem (1.7) is a C 1,α-diﬀeomorphism; this would contrast typical
regularity results for more general problems in the calculus of variations (including nonlinear elasticity), where
only partial regularity (e.g. C 1,α up to a set of measure zero) can be expected.

In this contribution, we are interested in cases where Ψ is not well behaved in the above sense; more
speciﬁcally, we allow for some lack of convexity and monotonicity of Ψ. Our results demonstrate that the
common representation W (F ) = Ψ(K(F )) of an arbitrary conformally invariant function W on GL+(2) is
neither ideal nor “natural” as far as convexity properties of W are concerned. Instead, by introducing the
linear distortion (or (large) dilatation [62])

equivalently express any conformally invariant energy W as W (F ) = h(K(F )). This representation turns out
to be much more convenient and suitable with respect to convexity properties of W .3

In particular, our results (cf. Remark 3.5) will allow us to easily generalize a consequence of a theorem
by Astala, Iwaniec and Martin [6, Theorem 21.1.3, p. 591], stating that for F0 ∈ GL+(2) and Ω = B1(0) and
any strictly increasing Ψ : [1, ∞) → [0, ∞) with sublinear growth,

= π · Ψ(1) .

(1.8)

(cid:41)

Note that the corresponding minimization problem has no solution unless F0 ∈ CSO(2). This result can
be expressed as a speciﬁc relaxation statement, namely that for these W (F ) = Ψ(K(F )), the quasiconvex
envelope QW of W is given by QW (F ) ≡ Ψ(1). Quasiconvex envelopes arise naturally in the calculus of
variations, representing the energetic response of a minimization problem without minimizers for linearly
homogeneous boundary values under the presence of microstructure, i.e. [20, 59, 53, 58]

2Note that the existence of minimizers follows from the polyconvexity [20, 18, 9] of the mapping F → Ψ(K(F )).
3On the other hand, since the distortion function K is diﬀerentiable on all of GL+(2) whereas the mapping F (cid:55)→ K(F ) is not,

it is advised to base numerical approaches to relaxation of conformally invariant energies on K.

for any domain Ω ⊂ R2 with Lebesgue measure |Ω|. If QW (F0) < W (F0) for some F0 ∈ GL+(2), then the
equilibrium state of the homogeneous deformation ϕ(x) = F0 x is unstable: the material shows an energetic
preference to develop ﬁner and ﬁner spatially modulated deformations (in engineering applications these are
typically shear bands) at ﬁxed averaged deformation F0 x. In this case, there are inﬁmizing sequences with
highly oscillating gradients which converge weakly (presuming appropriate coercivity conditions), but the
weak limit is not a minimizer.

In this respect, our main result also answers a particular case of Iwaniec’s Question 3 from [35]: “Which

[functions of the] distortion [Ψ(K(∇ϕ))] are weakly lower semi-continuous in W 1,2(Ω, R2)?”

2 Convexity properties of conformally invariant functions

In (planar) nonlinear elasticity theory, three generalized convexity properties [9, 20] of an energy function
W : GL+(2) → R are of particular interest: rank-one convexity, i.e. for all F ∈ GL+(2), t ∈ [0, 1] and
H ∈ R2×2 with rank(H) = 1 and det(F + H) > 0,

W ((1 − t)F + t(F + H)) ≤ (1 − t)W (F ) + tW (F + tH) ;

quasiconvexity, i.e. for every bounded open set Ω ⊂ R2 and all ϑ ∈ C∞

0 (Ω) such that det(F0 + ∇ϑ) > 0,

(cid:90)

Ω

W (F0 + ∇ϑ) dx ≥

(cid:90)

Ω

W (F0) dx = W (F0) · |Ω| ;

and polyconvexity of W , i.e.

W (F ) = P (F, det F )

for some convex function P : R2×2 × R ∼= R5 → R ∪ {+∞} .

The importance of quasiconvexity stems from the fact that quasiconvexity of W is essentially equivalent to
the weak lower semi-continuity of (cid:82)

Ω W (∇ϕ(x))dx [46]. The problem

(cid:90)

Ω

W (∇ϕ(x)) dx → min ,

ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Ω, R2) , ϕ(cid:12)

(cid:12)∂Ω(x) = F0 x

has a solution if and only if QW (F0) = W (F0); if QW (F0) < W (F0), then inﬁmizing sequences exhibit
microstructure eﬀects.

Under appropriate technical assumptions,

convexity =⇒ polyconvexity =⇒ quasiconvexity =⇒ rank-one convexity ,

(2.1)

whereas for dimension n ≥ 3, it is well known that the corresponding convexity properties are not equiva-
lent; Sverak famously showed that rank-one convexity does not imply quasiconvexity with a counterexample
consisting of a non-isotropic, non-objective polynomial of order four [60]. In the two-dimensional case dis-
cussed here, however, the question whether rank-one convexity is equivalent to quasiconvexity, known as the
remaining part of Morrey’s conjecture [46], is still unanswered [46, 5] and is considered one of the major open
problems in the calculus of variations [12, 11, 48].

In order to state criteria for the above convexity properties in the special case of conformally invariant
functions on GL+(2), we consider a number of diﬀerent representations available to express such functions.

Lemma 2.1 ([42]). Let W : GL+(2) → R be conformally invariant. Then there exist uniquely determined
functions g : (0, ∞) × (0, ∞) → R, h : (0, ∞) → R and Ψ : [1, ∞) → R such that

W (F ) = g(λ1, λ2) = h

,

g(x, y) = g(y, x)

and

g(ax, ay) = g(x, y)

(2.3)

Conversely, if the requirements (2.3) are satisﬁed for otherwise arbitrary functions g : (0, ∞)×(0, ∞) → R,

h : (0, ∞) → R or Ψ : [1, ∞) → R, then (2.2) deﬁnes a conformally invariant function W .

Note that h is already uniquely determined by its values on [1, ∞) and recall that K ≥ 1, with K(∇ϕ) = 1

if and only if ϕ is conformal.

The following proposition summarizes the main results from [42] and completely characterizes the gener-

alized convexity of conformally invariant functions on GL+(2).

Proposition 2.2 ([42]). Let W : GL+(2) → R be conformally invariant, and let g : (0, ∞) × (0, ∞) → R,
h : (0, ∞) → R and Ψ : [1, ∞) → R denote the uniquely determined functions with

W (F ) = g(λ1, λ2) = h

for all F ∈ GL+(2) with singular values λ1, λ2, where K(F ) = 1

i) W is polyconvex,

iv) g is separately convex,

ii) W is quasiconvex,

v) h is convex on (0, ∞),

iii) W is rank-one convex,

vi) h is convex and non-decreasing on [1, ∞).

Furthermore, if Ψ is twice continuously diﬀerentiable, then i)–vi) are equivalent to

vii) (x2 − 1) (x +

√

x2 − 1) Ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) + Ψ(cid:48)(x) ≥ 0

for all x ∈ (1, ∞).

Note that in terms of the representation function h, the convexity criteria can be expressed in a remarkably
simple way, especially when compared to vii), i.e. the representation in terms of the classical distortion K. In
particular, while monotonicity and convexity of Ψ are suﬃcient for the considered properties,4 convexity of
the energy with respect to K is not a necessary condition; for example, if W : GL+(2) → R is given by

W (F ) =

Since h : (0, ∞) → R is convex, the planar isochoric St. Venant–Kirchhoﬀ energy is quasiconvex according to
Proposition 2.2, while, e.g. the non-conformally-invariant term (cid:107)F T F − 1(cid:107)2 = (λ1 − 1)2 + (λ2 − 1)2 is not,
cf. Appendix C.

3 Generalized convexity properties and convex envelopes

For each of the convexity properties listed in the previous section, we can consider the corresponding envelope
of an arbitrary energy function W : GL+(2) → R, i.e.

RW (F ) = sup{w(F ) | w : GL+(2) → R rank-one convex, w(X) ≤ W (X) for all X ∈ GL+(2)} ,
w(X) ≤ W (X) for all X ∈ GL+(2)} ,
QW (F ) = sup{w(F ) | w : GL+(2) → R quasiconvex,
w(X) ≤ W (X) for all X ∈ GL+(2)} ,
P W (F ) = sup{w(F ) | w : GL+(2) → R polyconvex,
w(X) ≤ W (X) for all X ∈ GL+(2)} .
CW (F ) = sup{w(F ) | w : GL+(2) → R convex,

Since polyconvexity implies quasiconvexity, which in turn implies rank-one convexity (cf. [8, Theorem 3.3]
for the case of isotropic functions on GL+(n)), it is easy to see that CW (F ) ≤ P W (F ) ≤ QW (F ) ≤ RW (F ).5
However, while a number of numerical methods are available to approximate the rank-one convex envelope
RW [23, 13, 52] as well as the polyconvex envelope P W [22, 39, 14, 4], it is diﬃcult to analytically compute
RW , P W or the quasiconvex envelope QW of a given energy W in general, although explicit representations
have been found for a number of particular functions, including the St. Venant–Kirchhoﬀ energy [41] and
several challenging problems encountered in engineering applications [17, 3]. Further examples can be found
in [20, Chapter 6].

More general methods for computing the quasiconvex envelope are often based on the observation that
RW = P W and thus RW = QW for certain classes of energy functions W . In many such cases, even the
equality RW = CW holds [21, 54], i.e. the generalized convex envelopes are all identical to the classical
convex envelope of W , cf. Appendix C.

Yan [63] showed that non-constant rank-one convex conformal energy functions (cf. Footnote 1 for the
distinction between conformally invariant and conformal energy functions) deﬁned on all of Rn×n for n ≥ 3
must grow at least with power n
2 , which implies that the quasiconvex envelope of a conformal energy W on
R3×3 must be constant if W exhibits sublinear growth.6 The results given in the following show that an
analogous property holds for conformally invariant energies on GL+(2).

In order to apply Proposition 2.2 to the computation of generalized convex envelopes, the following

invariance property of the rank-one convex envelope will be required.

Lemma 3.1. If W : GL+(n) → R is conformally invariant, then RW is conformally invariant.

5Examples of functions where P W < QW were examined, for example, by Gangbo [26].
6This result is essentially sharp: M¨uller, ˇSver´ak and Yan [47, Theorem 1.2] have shown that there exists a nontrivial quasi-

convex conformal energy function W : R2×2 → R with a constant c+ > 0 such that for all F ∈ R2×2,

0 ≤ W (F ) ≤ c+ (1 + (cid:107)F (cid:107))

and

W (F ) = 0 ⇐⇒ F ∈ CSO(2) .

7

Proof. It is well known that the left- and right-SO(2)-invariance is preserved by the rank-one convex envelope
[16, 21, 40], so due to the characterization (1.2) of conformal invariance it remains to show that RW (aF ) =
RW (F ) for all a > 0 and all F ∈ GL+(2).

We use the characterization RW (F ) = limk→∞ RkW (F ) of the rank-one convex envelope [20, p. 202],

where R0W (F ) = W (F ) and

Rk+1W (F ) := inf

tRkW (F1) + (1 − t)RkW (F2) | t ∈ [0, 1], tF1 + (1 − t)F2 = F, rank(F1 − F2) = 1

,

(cid:111)

(cid:110)

and show by induction that RkW (aF ) = RkW (F ) for all k ≥ 0. First, we ﬁnd R0W (aF ) = W (aF ) =
W (F ) = R0W (F ), so assume that RkW (F ) = RkW (aF ) for some k ≥ 1. For any ε > 0, choose F1, F2 ∈
GL+(2) and t ∈ [0, 1] with tF1 +(1−t)F2 = F and rank(F1 −F2) = 1 such that tRkW (F1)+(1−t)RkW (F2) ≤
Rk+1W (F ) + ε. Then, since taF1 + (1 − t)aF2 = aF and rank(aF1 − aF2) = 1,

Rk+1W (aF ) ≤ tRkW (aF1) + (1 − t)RkW (aF2) = tRkW (F1) + (1 − t)RkW (F2) ≤ Rk+1W (F ) + ε ,

thus Rk+1W (aF ) ≤ Rk+1W (F ). Analogously, we ﬁnd Rk+1W (F ) ≤ Rk+1W (aF ) and thereby RW (aF ) =
(cid:4)
limk→∞ RkW (aF ) = limk→∞ RkW (F ) = RW (F ).

Remark 3.2. By direct computation, it is easy to see that QW is conformally invariant if W : GL+(n) → R
is conformally invariant. Similar to the rank-one convex envelope it is well known [16, 21, 40] that the left-
and right-SO(2)-invariance is preserved by QW , and the equality

3.1 Main result on the quasiconvex envelope

We can now state our main result.

Theorem 3.3. Let W : GL+(2) → R be conformally invariant, and let h : [1, ∞) → R denote the function
uniquely determined by

W (F ) = h

(cid:19)

(cid:18) λ1

(3.1)

for all F ∈ GL+(2) with ordered singular values λ1 ≥ λ2. Then

(cid:19)

for all F ∈ GL+(2) ,

(3.2)

where Cmh : [1, ∞) → R denotes the monotone-convex envelope given by

Cmh(t) := sup

(cid:110)

p(t) | p : [1, ∞) → R monotone increasing and convex with p(s) ≤ h(s) ∀ s ∈ [1, ∞)

(cid:111)

.

(cid:16) λ1
Proof. Let w(F ) := Cmh
λ2
mapping w : GL+(2) → R is polyconvex. Therefore, since

(cid:17)

w(F ) = Cmh

(cid:19)

(cid:18) λ1
λ2

= W (F ) ,

8

we ﬁnd w(F ) ≤ P W (F ) for all F ∈ GL+(2). Since P W (F ) ≤ QW (F ) ≤ RW (F ), it only remains to show
that RW (F ) ≤ w(F ) in order to establish (3.2).

According to Lemma 3.1, RW is conformally invariant, thus according to Lemma 2.1 there exists a uniquely
for all F ∈ GL+(2) with singular values λ1 ≥ λ2. Due

(cid:16) λ1
determined (cid:101)h : [1, ∞) → R such that RW (F ) = (cid:101)h
λ2
to the rank-one convexity of RW and Proposition 2.2, the function (cid:101)h is convex and non-decreasing. Since

(cid:17)

(cid:101)h(t) = RW (diag(t, 1)) ≤ W (diag(1, t)) = h(t)

as well, we ﬁnd (cid:101)h(t) ≤ Cmh(t) for all t ∈ [1, ∞) and thus

RW (F ) = (cid:101)h

(cid:19)

(cid:18) λ1
λ2

≤ Cmh

(cid:19)

(cid:18) λ1

= w(F )

for all F ∈ GL+(2).

(cid:4)

Remark 3.4. If h is monotone increasing, then Cmh = Ch, i.e. the monotone-convex envelope (which is the
largest convex non-decreasing function not exceeding h [59, Prop. 4.1]) is identical to the (classical) convex
envelope Ch of h on [1, ∞). Furthermore, if h is continuous, then computing the monotone-convex envelope
Cmh can easily be reduced to the simple one-dimensional problem of ﬁnding the convex envelope C(cid:101)h of the
function

(cid:101)h : [1, ∞) → R ,

(cid:101)h(t) =




min
s∈[1,∞)

h(s)

: t ≤ min argmin h ,



h(t)

: otherwise,

where min argmin h = min{s ∈ [1, ∞) | h(s) = min h}, cf. Figure 1. In particular, if h attains its minimum at
1, then (cid:101)h = h and thus Cmh = Ch. Note that if h is not bounded below, then Cmh is not well deﬁned (and
neither is RW ).

Remark 3.5. If Ψ : [1, ∞) → R is strictly monotone with sublinear growth, then both these properties hold
for the function h : [1, ∞) → R with Ψ(K(F )) = h( λ1
λ2

) =: W (F ) as well, which implies

QW = Cmh = Ch ≡ h(1) = Ψ(1) .

For this special case, we directly recover the earlier result (1.8) originally due to Astala, Iwaniec, and Martin
[6].

Remark 3.6. The monotone-convex envelope of h : [1, ∞) → R can also be obtained by “reﬂecting” the
graph of the function at x = 1 and taking the classical convex envelope: if (cid:98)h : R → R denotes the extension
of h to R deﬁned by

(cid:40)

(cid:98)h(x) :=

h(x)
h(1 − x)

: x > 1 ,
: x ≤ 1 ,

then Cmh = C(cid:98)h|R≥1, cf. Figure 1 and Appendix A.

4 Speciﬁc relaxation examples and numerical simulations

Theorem 3.3 can be used to explicitly compute the quasiconvex envelope for a substantial class of functions.
In the following, a number of explicit relaxation examples will be considered and some of our analytical results
will be compared to numerical simulations.

4.1 The deviatoric Hencky energy
First, consider the (planar) deviatoric Hencky strain energy [32, 49] WdH : GL+(2) → R,

WdH(F ) = log2

(cid:19)

.

(cid:18) λ1
λ2

Since the representing function h : [1, ∞) → R with h(t) = log2(t) is monotone, we ﬁnd

and thus

Cmh(t) = Ch(t) = 0

for all t ∈ [1, ∞)

RWdH = QWdH = P WdH ≡ 0 .

Note that due to the sublinear growth of h (or, equivalently, of the representation K (cid:55)→ arccosh2(K)), this
result can also be obtained by eq. (1.8), cf. Remark 3.5.

Interestingly, the deviatoric Hencky strain energy itself is directly related to the conformal group CSO(n):
Let distgeod(·, ·) denote the geodesic distance on the Lie group GL+(n) with respect to the canonical left-
invariant Riemannian metric [44, 45]. Then the distance of F ∈ GL+(n) to the special orthogonal group
SO(n) ⊂ GL+(n) is given by [49, Theorem 3.3]

dist2

geod(F, SO(n)) = min

(cid:101)R∈SO(n)

dist2

geod(F, (cid:101)R) = (cid:107)log U (cid:107)2 .

(4.1)

The deviatoric Hencky strain energy can therefore be characterized by the equality

4.3 The exponentiated Hencky energy

Now, consider the exponentiated deviatoric Hencky energy [50]

for some parameter k > 0.

8 . For any 0 < k < 1

It has previously been shown [51, 27, 43] that WeH is polyconvex (and thus

8 , we can explicitly compute the quasiconvex envelope: since
WeH(F ) = ek log2 (cid:0) λ1

λ2

(cid:1)

and since the mapping t (cid:55)→ h(t) = ek log2(t) is monotone increasing on [1, ∞), we ﬁnd

RWeH(F ) = QWeH(F ) = P WeH(F ) = Ch

(cid:16) λ1
λ2

(cid:17)

for all F ∈ GL+(2) with singular values λ1, λ2.

In order to further investigate the behavior of this quasiconvex relaxation with ﬁnite element simulations, we
choose the particular value k = 0.11 < 1

8 and consider the quasiconvex envelope QW (F ) of
(cid:18) λ1

(cid:16)

Using Maxwell’s equal area rule [58, p. 319], we numerically compute the monotone-convex envelope of h up
to ﬁve decimal digits:

Cmh(t) = Ch(t) =

: 2.65363 < t < 35.4998 ,
: 35.4998 ≤ t .

This explicit representation allows us to determine the set of all F ∈ GL+(2) with QW (F ) < W (F ), known
as the binodal region [29, 28]. In particular, the microstructure energy gap (cf. Figure 3) between h and Ch is
maximal at λ1

Figure 4 shows two numerical simulations of the microstructure on triangle grids with diﬀerent resolutions.
The illustration shows the reference conﬁguration, colored according to the value of the determinant of the
deformation gradient (plotting K instead results in similar images). The energy level of the conﬁguration on
the left is 6.17149 on a grid with 294 912 vertices. Repeating the computation on a grid with one additional
step of uniform reﬁnement leads to the conﬁguration on the right, which has an energy level of 6.16216.

Note that the values obtained for the energy level still diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the expected value of
6.13194. It is unclear whether the discrepancy is solely due to insuﬃcient mesh resolution; further numerical
investigations on more performant hardware are planned for the future. The expected energy level was, how-
ever, obtained numerically using a modiﬁcation of an algorithm by Bartels [14] for computing the polyconvex
envelope.

Again, we want to further investigate the microstructure induced by W with numerical simulations on
Ω = B1(0). For our calculations, we consider the case L = 2. At x0 = λ1
= 1, the microstructure energy gap
λ2
between between h and Ch is maximal with a value of ∆ ≈ 0.54308, hence we use homogeneous Dirichlet

We again compute the microstructure using ﬁnite element simulations. The microstructure exhibited by
this example signiﬁcantly diﬀers from the previous one; in particular, no simple laminar structure can be
observed at all (Figure 6). As expected, we obtain deformations with K very close to the value 2 throughout
the domain (Figure 7). The energy levels obtained numerically are also very close to the expected value of 0.
Speciﬁcally, for meshes with 294 912 and 1 179 648 grid vertices, the obtained energy levels are 2.533 · 10−3
and 1.369 · 10−3, respectively.

Figure 6: Microstructure for the energy W (F ) = cosh(K(F ) − 2) − 1 with boundary conditions F0 = 1 on a
grid with 294 912 vertices (deformed conﬁguration). The coloring shows the distribution of det F .

In the following, we will discuss a close connection of the quasiconvex envelope (4.3) and the observed
microstructure to an earlier result by Yan [65, 64], which implies that the microstructure should approximately
satisfy K(∇ϕ) = 2 almost everywhere on Ω.

In two remarkable contributions [65, 64], Yan considered the Dirichlet problem

(cid:107)∇ϕ(cid:107)n

op = l det ∇ϕ

a.e. in Ω ⊂ Rn

for an arbitrary number l ≥ 1 under aﬃne boundary conditions and obtained the following existence result.

Theorem 4.1 ([65, Theorem 1.2]). Let l ≥ 1. Given any aﬃne map x (cid:55)→ F0 x + b, the Dirichlet problem

is solvable in W 1,n(Ω; Rn) if and only if (cid:107)F0(cid:107)n

essentially constant except near the boundary.

Using Corollary 4.3, it is possible to obtain the relaxation result (4.3) by directly computing the quasi-

although there is no homogeneous equilibrium solution, there exist a deformation (cid:98)ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Ω; R2) with
(cid:98)ϕ|∂Ω = F0 x and K(∇ (cid:98)ϕ) = L due to Corollary 4.3. Then ΨL(K(∇ (cid:98)ϕ)) = 0 and thus

A The quasiconvex envelope for a class of conformal energies

The concept of monotone-convex envelopes is directly connected to an earlier result by Dacorogna and Koshigoe [21], who
obtained an explicit relaxation result for a subclass of conformal energy functions.

Lemma A.1 (Proposition 5.1 [21]). Let W : R2×2 → R be of the form

W (F ) := g(

(cid:107)F (cid:107)2 − 2 det F ) ,

(cid:113)

g : [0, ∞) → R .

(A.1)

Deﬁne

Then

(cid:101)g : R → R ,

(cid:101)g(x) =

(cid:40)

g(x)
g(−x)

: x > 0 ,
: x ≤ 0 .

CW (F ) = P W (F ) = QW (F ) = RW (F ) = (cid:101)g∗∗(cid:0)(cid:113)

(cid:107)F (cid:107)2 − 2 det F (cid:1) ,

where (cid:101)g∗ is the Legendre-transformation of (cid:101)g and (cid:101)g∗∗ = ((cid:101)g∗)∗.

The same result can be found in [59, Prop. 4.1]. Note that the convexity of the mapping F (cid:55)→ (cid:101)g∗∗((cid:112)(cid:107)F (cid:107)2 − 2 det F ) =
(cid:101)g∗∗((cid:112)(λ1 − λ2)2) follows directly [10] from the fact that (cid:101)g∗∗ is convex and non-decreasing on [0, ∞). Furthermore, if g ≥ 0,
then W of the form (A.1) is a conformal energy in the sense of Footnote 1.

Figure 8: The monotone-convex envelope Cmg of g : [0, ∞) → R can be obtained via the convex envelope Cmg of the even
extension (cid:101)g of g.

If g is continuous and bounded below, then based on [20, Theorem 2.43] it is easy to show that the monotone-convex envelope

of g is exactly the restriction of (cid:101)g to [0, ∞):

Cmg = (C(cid:101)g)(cid:12)

(cid:12)[0,∞) ,

C(cid:101)g = g∗∗ .

Similar to the geodesic distance considered in Section 4.1, the expression (cid:112)(cid:107)F (cid:107)2 − 2 det F can be characterized as a measure
of distance to the conformal group:7 since the closure CSO(2) ∪ {0} of CSO(2) is a linear subspace8 of R2×2 with an orthonormal

where (cid:104)·, ·(cid:105) denotes the canonical inner product on R2×2. Therefore, the energy functions considered in Lemma A.1 depend only
on the Euclidean distance of F to CSO(2).

B Connections to the Gr¨otzsch problem

Proposition 2.2 negatively answers a conjecture by Adamowicz [1, Conjecture 1], which (in the two-dimensional case) states that
if a conformal energy W : GL+(2) → R with W (F ) = Ψ(K(F )) is polyconvex, then Ψ is non-decreasing and convex. A direct
counterexample is given by W (F ) = λmax
, which is polyconvex due to criterion v) in Proposition 2.2 with h(t) = t, but the
λmin
representation W (F ) = Ψ(K(F )) = earccosh(K(F )) is not convex with respect to K(F ).

Furthermore, criterion iv) in Proposition 2.2 reveals a direct connection between the so-called Gr¨otzsch property and quasi-

convexity in the two-dimensional case.

Deﬁnition B.1 ([1]). Let W : GL+(n) → R be conformally invariant. Then W satisﬁes the Gr¨otzsch property if for every
Q = [0, a1] × · · · × [0, an] ⊂ Rn and every Q(cid:48) = [0, a(cid:48)

n] ⊂ Rn, the functional

an
loc (Q; Q(cid:48)), p ≥ n with det ∇ϕ > 0 that satisfy the Gr¨otzsch boundary conditions, i.e. map each (n − 1)–dimensional

7Note that the Euclidean distance can be considered a linearization of the geodesic distance and, unlike the latter, does not
take into account the Lie group structure of either GL+(2) or CSO(2). For a detailed discussion of the relation between these
distance measures and their applicability to the deformation gradient in nonlinear mechanics, see [49].

8More generally [57, p.24], the set [0, ∞) · SO(n) is convex for n ≥ 1.

19

Note that the boundary condition imposed in Deﬁnition B.1 does not require the admissible mappings to be aﬃne at the

boundary, since each of the faces can be mapped to the corresponding ones in an arbitrary (possibly non-linear) manner.

In the two-dimensional case, the representation of the energy in terms of the singular values allows us to infer the quasicon-

vexity from the Gr¨otzsch property in a particularly straightforward way.

Proposition B.2. Let W : GL+(2) → R be conformally invariant and satisfy the Gr¨otzsch property for all Q, Q(cid:48). Then W is
polyconvex.

Proof. Assume that W is not polyconvex. Then g : (0, ∞)2 → R with W (F ) = g(λ1, λ2) is not separately convex according to
criterion iv) in Proposition 2.2. Therefore, there exist λ1, (cid:98)λ1, λ2 ∈ (0, ∞) and t ∈ (0, 1) such that

tg(λ1, λ2) + (1 − t)g((cid:98)λ1, λ2) < g(tλ1 + (1 − t)(cid:98)λ1, λ2) .

Now, let Q = [0, 1]2 and Q(cid:48) = [0, tλ1 + (1 − t)(cid:98)λ1], and deﬁne ϕ : Q → Q(cid:48) by
(cid:33)

Then ϕ satisﬁes the Gr¨otzsch boundary conditions, ϕ ∈ W 1,p(Q; Q(cid:48)) for all p ≥ 1 and

where F0 = diag(tλ1 + (1 − t)(cid:98)λ1, λ2) is the boundary-compatible linear mapping from Q to Q(cid:48). Therefore, W does not satisfy
(cid:4)
the Gr¨otzsch condition.

C The convex envelope of conformally invariant planar energies

The quasiconvex envelopes computed in Section 4 are, in general, not convex, i.e. QW (F ) > CW (F ) for some F ∈ GL+(2).
In fact, the following explicit computation shows that the convex envelope of any conformally invariant energy is necessarily
constant.

Recall that the convex envelope CW of an energy W : M → R with a non-convex domain M ⊂ Rn×n (e.g. M = GL+(2)) is

deﬁned as the restriction C (cid:102)W |M of the convex envelope C (cid:102)W of the function
(cid:40)

(cid:102)W : conv(M ) → R ∪ {+∞} , (cid:102)W (F ) =

W (F )

: F ∈ M ,

+∞ : F /∈ M

to M , where conv(M ) denotes the convex hull of the set M . Note that (cid:102)W can be further extended to a convex function (cid:99)W on
Rn×n by setting (cid:99)W (F ) = +∞ for all F /∈ conv(M ).

Proposition C.1. Let W : GL+(2) → R be conformally invariant and bounded below. Then

for all F ∈ GL+(2).

CW (F ) = inf

(cid:110)

W ( (cid:101)F ) | (cid:101)F ∈ GL+(2)

(cid:111)

Proof. We only need to show that CW is constant on GL+(2). First, observe that the convex envelope of W is conformally
invariant.9 By the deﬁnition of convexity on GL+(2) employed here, CW must be the restriction of a convex function (cid:99)W : R2×2 →
R to GL+(2). Let b := (cid:99)W (0). Then for all F ∈ GL+(2) and t ∈ [−1, 1], we ﬁnd

(cid:40)

(cid:99)W (tF ) =

CW (tF ) = CW (F )
b

: t (cid:54)= 0 ,
: t = 0 ,

thus CW (F ) = b due to the convexity of (cid:99)W .

(cid:4)

9The proof of the bi-SO(2)-invariance of CW given by Buttazzo et al. [16, Therem 3.1] can easily be adapted to include the

scaling invariance.

20

As indicated in Section 3, analytical methods for ﬁnding generalized convex envelopes have often been based on the
observation that RW = CW for certain classes of energy functions W and the subsequent computation of the classical
convex envelope CW ; for example, this method is applicable to the St. Venant–Kirchhoﬀ energy function [41] WSVK(F ) =

(cid:0)tr(F T F − 1)(cid:1)2.

One of the most frequently cited examples of an isotropic and objective energy function W with RW = QW = P W (cid:54)= CW

8

is the example of Kohn and Strang [37, 38], where, in the R2×2-case [66, 24],

W (F ) =

(cid:40)

1 + (cid:107)F (cid:107)2

but

Furthermore, if W : GL+(n) → R is a volumetric energy function of the form W (F ) = f (det F ) with f : (0, ∞) → R, then
RW (F ) = QW (F ) = P W (F ) = Cf (det F ) and, in general, CW (F ) < QW (F ), see [20, Theorem 6.24].
