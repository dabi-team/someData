Abstract 
Discharge structure refers to the morphology of different plasma quantities, such as electron temperature, 
reaction rate, plasma potential, mass flux, net charge and species density, which are determined by plasma 
transport  mechanism  and  chemical  processes.  This  morphology  is  rather  difficult  to  refine  in  complex 
electronegative  plasma  for  it  is  contained  in  a  multiple-physics-field  coupled  system.  Regarding  this 
difficulty, the combination of self-consistent simulation, theory analysis and experimental diagnostic of this 
system is needed. In the scope of present article, the fluid simulation and analytic theory are utilized to 
investigate the Ar/Cl2 inductive plasma, via a cyclic tuning of discharge pressure and feedstock gas content 
parameters when fixing the power. Classic discharge structure (e.g., delta, parabola, flat-top, and hollow) 
and specific discharge mechanisms (e.g., self-coagulation, physics coagulation, de-coagulation, grouping 
behavior and the ambi-polar diffusion of triple species) are revealed. Besides, the two types of discharge 
stratification, i.e., space and species, are presented. Many non-neutralities are generated during the transport 
process  of  electronegative  plasma  when  it  gives  rise  to  the  discharge  structure,  which  are  summed  and 
analyzed for better understanding the plasma.     
Key words: Discharge structure, morphology of plasma, discharge stratification, non-neutrality, coagulation 

I. Introduction 
Gaseous discharge structure of laboratory plasma is very important issue, which has been investigated by 
many  researchers.  At  initial,  the  spatially  resolved  plasma  density,  electron  temperature  and  electric 
potential of argon plasma were measured by Langmuir probe [1] and validated by fluid or hybrid models 
[2,3]. For reactive plasmas, Han et al used the same method to investigate the electron density profile of 
Ar/O2 inductively couple plasma [4]. It is noted that these comparative studies cannot reveal the transport 
scheme of plasma  and neither explains the profile characteristics. Besides for the experiments  and self-
consistent  simulations,  early  researchers  still  paid  attention  on  establishing  analytic  theories  for  better 
understanding the discharge structure. They started from the electropositive plasma, and generated many 
useful conclusions by using drift-diffusion flux and continuity equation, together with the simple chemistry. 
Parabola, trigonometric, and Bessel distributions of plasma density were given with another approximation, 
ambi-polar diffusion [5]. These researchers later extended the above analytic method content and shifted it 
into  the  electronegative  plasma  field.  They  introduced  the  anion  Boltzmann,  and  sequentially  built  the 
parabola  (suitable  for  electronegative  plasma),  ellipse  and  flat-top  models  [6,7].  Other  academicians 
utilized the similar analytic theory to predict the species-stratification, parabola and uniform profiles, by 
means  of  their  own  definitions  of  different  models  [8].  Besides,  there  are  still  many  other  phenomena 
discovered, such as the space-stratification [9], double layer [10], ions acoustics [11], and internal sheath 
[12] etc. These are more about the microscopic characteristic of discharge structure. These analytic works 
guided  well  the  experimental  activities  of  that  time,  for  many  diagnostics  of  electronegative  plasma 
compared  their  ions  density  with  parabola  and  flat-top  models  [13-15].  Relatively,  the  self-consistent 
simulation works are not related to the above analytic works. Many researchers of simulation field even are 
not familiar with these theories. This leads to difficulties on analyzing the simulated profiles, i.e., discharge 
structure. To us, not only the densities are important, but also other quantities, such as charge density, mass 
flux, chemical source, species velocity and so on. The present work of this article is aimed at solving this 

  1  /  36 

 
 
problem, by taking the Ar/Cl2 inductive plasma as one example at a cyclic tuning of discharge parameter. 
Together with the previous correlative works of Ar/SF6 and Ar/O2 inductive plasmas [16,17] where the self-
coagulation theory was constructed, we plan to build up the elaborate discharge structure of electronegative 
plasmas, first by means of fluid model simulation and analytic theories. Then validated by experiments and 
amend by kinetic effects.   

II. Fluid model and Ar/Cl2 chemistry 
As mentioned, in this work the fluid model and analytic theory are used to analyze the Ar/Cl2 inductive 
plasma discharge structure. The fluid model is described in Ref. [16], together with the analytic theories, 
including the old ones, such as flat-top model and the new self-coagulation. Here in this section, only the 
chemistry and surface kinetics are introduced, which are listed in Tabs. 1 and 2.

in the Ar/Cl2 inductively coupled plasma, given by the fluid simulation, at the discharge conditions of 300W, 
10mTorr and 5% of Cl2 gas content.   
As the early analytic work predicted, there are two types of discharge stratification in the electronegative 
plasmas. Here in this section, the known species-stratification is illustrated, which occurs at the case of low 
electronegativity. It indicates that the densities of different charged species in the electronegative core is 
stratified [8]. This is different with the so-called space-stratification that divides the whole bulk discharge 
region into the electronegative core and electropositive edge [9]. The fluid simulation shown in Fig. 1 gives 
the Cl- anion density and its net source, as well as the summed cations density and electron density, at only 
5% Cl2 content in the feedstock gas mixture. As seen, the Cl- density behaves like a comet, also called as 
quasi-delta profile. This  novel  anion  density  distribution  has been reported in  our previous paper  about 
Ar/O2 inductively coupled plasma [17], which is a low electronegativity case as well. It was interpreted by 
the  self-coagulation  behavior  that  is  controlled  by  the  quasi-  Helmholtz  equation.  Self-coagulation  we 
reported is one type of self-organization behaviors. It naturally happens once the necessary conditions are 

  5  /  36

satisfied, i.e., negative chemical source and transport component of free diffusion. Superficially, the self-
consistent  fluid  simulation  predicts  a  delta  profile,  not  in  accord  to  the  analytic  solution  that  gives  the 
smooth stratified species density profiles. Nevertheless, when zooming into the delta inside, it is found that 
species-stratification is hidden by the delta structure in Fig. 2. As seen, after the operations of expansion, 
normalization and plotting format revision, the fluid simulation perfectly repeats the analytic work, in the 
scope of species-stratification. In the simulation, why the delta structure is superposed? Caused by the anion 
dynamics (described above). The anion is assumed to satisfy the Boltzmann relation in the analytics and 
the  self-organization  cannot  be  considered  thereby.  Although  the  simulation  is  more  complete,  the 
importance of analytic work predictions is emphasized, since it is difficult to understand the simulations 
without the guide of analytics.

conditions of 300W, 10mTorr and 5% Cl2 content. This plot shows that the species-stratification is hidden 
by the self-coagulation behavior.

(b) Conventional space-stratification analogous to Ar/SF6 discharge 
At high enough Cl2 content ratio, 90%, the discharge structure of Ar/Cl2 inductive plasma evolves to the 
conventional space-stratification, i.e., the combination of electronegative core and electropositive edge, as 
shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 plots the axial and radial distributions of species densities, respectively. As seen, 
this is very similar to the Ar/SF6 inductive discharge case, where the parabola trait of core and the self-
coagulation  portion  along  the  radial  profile  are  displayed.  The  difference  is  that  the  Ar/Cl2  plasma 
electronegativity is weaker than the Ar/SF6 plasma. Hence, the reactive gas content of Ar/Cl2 plasma (90%) 
here is higher than the Ar/SF6 case, i.e., 10%. Even at high reactive gas ratio, the electronegativity is slightly 
lower than the Ar/SF6 plasma. Accordingly, the electropositive halo of Ar/Cl2 plasma is wider and the core 
electron density is higher, upon comparing with Ar/SF6 plasma, in accord to the analytic prediction [7].

the conventional space-stratification structure and the embodied self-coagulation structure.   

(c) From delta/comet profile to parabola and the core expansion: Cl2 gas content effect 
The simulations show that delta plasma profile of Ar/Cl2 inductive discharge at 10mTorr evolves into the 
parabola profile upon increasing the Cl2 gas ratio, as shown in Fig. 5. At low Cl2 content, the delta profile 
is  a  special  space-stratification  structure  at  the  extreme  condition,  very  low  electronegativity,  that  the 
electronegative  core  is  substantially  shrunk.  This  is  logic  and  determined  by  the  origin  of  space-
stratification [16]. At the two cases, the self-coagulation is accompanied. The difference is that at low Cl2 
content, electronegative core is slim and self-coagulation is predominant; and so, anion displays the comet 
profile. While at high Cl2 content, core is fat and self-coagulation is embodied in the wide parabola profile.

In Fig. 6, the evolution of Cl- anion density with pressure is presented at fixed Cl2 content (90%) and 300W. 
Besides for the self-coagulation-to-coil (SCC) behavior (reported in Ref. [16]), it experiences the parabola, 
ellipse  and  flat-top  models  (the  same  as  in  the Ar/SF6  plasma  [16]),  which  is  already  well-known  and 
determined by their respective analytic theory [16]. The cations density displays the same trend against 
pressure, given by the ambi-polar diffusion potential which is not collapsed. See the Secs. (b, c) for more 
details. This is different with the Ar/SF6 plasma where the advective ambi-polar self-coagulation scheme, 
i.e., blue negative internal sheath, helps the cations coagulate [16].

(b) Electron coagulates at ambi-polar diffusion and ions self-coagulation 

Figure  7  Electron  density  profiles  of Ar/Cl2  inductive  plasma  at  different  pressures,  (a)  10mTorr,  (b) 
20mTorr, (c) 30mTorr, and (d) 50mTorr, given by fluid simulation at 300W and 90% Cl2 content.   

In Fig. 7, the electron density coagulates toward the coil at increasing the pressure because of the ions self-
coagulation, at 90% Cl2 content and 300W power, very similar to the Ar/SF6 plasma [16]. The difference is 
that in the Ar/Cl2 plasma, the ambi-polar diffusion potential of high pressure, e.g., 50mTorr, is not collapsed, 
as shown in Fig. 8(b), due to the low electronegativity exhibited in Fig. 9. Since free-diffusion condition is 
not satisfied, the peripherical self-coagulation of electrons is not happened and hence electron is Boltzmann 
balanced (also quite different with Ar/SF6 plasma) in Fig. 8(c). The similar trend in 90mTorr Ar/Cl2 plasma 
of 90% Cl2 and 300W is presented in Fig. 8(d-f). It is seen that the anion’s self-coagulation leads to the 
electron’s tight coagulation to the coil, while the electron’s self-coagulation deviates the Boltzmann relation. 
At the high pressure of 90mTorr, when decreasing the Cl2 content to 5%, this tight-coagulation-to-coil of 
electron  (a  high  electronegativity  behavior),  i.e.,  with  its  density  peak  almost  attached  to  the  dielectric 
window, is replaced by a departing-coil-type coagulation, where anion self-coagulation is destroyed at the 
shortage of reactive feedstock. See the Fig. 22 of Sec. (3.3) for reference.

fluid simulation at 300W power.   

In this section, the ambi-polar self-coagulation of Ar/Cl2 plasma is discussed. In Fig. 10, the net charge 
densities of different discharge conditions of this plasma are presented. In Fig. 10(a), at 10mTorr and 5% 
Cl2 content, where delta type anion is given, the blue negative sheath is seen, which represents the advective 
ambi-polar self-coagulation, as illustrated in Ref. [16] when the Ar/O2 inductive plasma is involved. The 
non-advective (i.e., spontaneous) ambi-polar self-coagulation is observed at 10mTorr and 90% Cl2 content, 
like the case of Ar/SF6 plasma at 10mTorr and 10% SF6 content [16]. Of interest is that at 50mTorr and 
90mTorr of 90% Cl2 content, it is so strange to find that the blue negative sheath is not appeared, different 
with the Ar/SF6 plasma at similar conditions (compare to the Fig. 51(c,d) of Ref .[16]). This is because that 
the ambi-polar diffusion potential of Ar/Cl2 plasma is not collapsed and it helps the cations gently following 
the anion’s self-coagulation, not forming sheath. This is analogous to the electropositive plasma where ion 
gently  follows  the  electron’s  self-diffusion  at  ambi-polar  diffusion  potential,  which  is  approximated 
electrically neutral. In a word, the process of ambi-polar diffusion is known to eliminate the non-neutrality 
of plasma, suitable for the escaping electrons (via free-diffusion) and anions (via chemical  coagulation) 
relative to the cation coordinate, as shown in Fig. 11. So, this is called gentle ambi-polar self-coagulation. 
The red and radiative sheaths of 50mTorr and 90mTorr cases are originated from the mass-point expelling 
effect, as has been illustrated in Ref. [16]. This non-neutrality is not that strong as in Ar/SF6 plasma, as 
compared with Fig. 41(d) of Ref. [16], since the density orders of different cations are not close to each 
other, as shown in Fig. 12.

Ar/Cl2 plasma, given by fluid model simulation at 300W power. The 90mTorr Ar/Cl2 plasma exhibits the 
same  trend. The  product  of  electric  field  and  cation  density  represents  the  drift  of  it  in  the  ambi-polar

ambi-polar diffusion of two species system (electron and ion). Other cations, Ar+ and Cl+, exhibit the same 
+. The dual-role of cation in the process is originated from electron free diffusion and anion self-
trend as Cl2
coagulation. Free diffusion directs to substrate and self-coagulation directs to dielectric window. So, the 
drift of cations consists of two parts, thin red part and wide blue part (refer to the cylindrical coordinate 
system). At the interface (or border) of the two transports, the cation drift is almost zero at the counteract 
of ambi-polar diffusion and self-coagulation, indicating its self-Boltzmann property.

In  this  section,  the  non-neutralities  discovered  presently  in  the  low  temperature  plasma  sources  are 
summarized  and  discussed.  Based  on  our  understanding,  they  are  divided  into  two  parts,  strong  non-
neutrality  and  quasi-neutrality,  as  illustrated  in  Tab.  3.  Furthermore,  the  strong  non-neutrality  itself  is 
divided into two parts, which are  given by  collective and against roles, respectively. The plasma  quasi-
neutrality is focused on the very weak and almost negligible charge accumulation. For now, it is given by 
the collective role. It includes two parts as well, which are happened respectively in electropositive and 
electronegative plasmas.  In  electropositive plasma, the ion-electron  dual-species ambi-polar diffusion  is 
considered,  and  in  electronegative  plasma  the  triple-species  (cation,  anion  and  electron)  ambi-polar 
diffusion  is  suggested,  which  actually  contains  the  cation-anion  self-coagulation  and  cation-electron 
diffusion (both are ambi-polar).   
Collective role means that the various plasma species interact with each other for finishing certain mission, 
i.e., a collaboration behavior. Many instances belong to such type, e.g., chamber border sheath (positive, 
always plotted red in the colormap). Besides, the advective ambi-polar self-coagulation early reported in 
Ref. [16] generates electronegative sheath in the plasma bulk, which is plotted as blue in the colormap. On 
the opposite, against role implies that certain processes of complex plasma fight against each other, and 
finally give rise to special consequence. For instance, the mass point potential, given by the expelling effect 
of transformed charge elements with same polarity (originated from self-coagulation), and the double layer, 
produced by the pushing and accumulating anion of ambi-polar potential of cation and electron. As analyzed, 
these  interactions  are  conflicted  and  therefore  we  propose  the  definition  of  against  role,  relative  to  the 
collective role (well-known property), for better understanding plasma. More details of these plasma non-
neutralities are given in Fig. 13.

(3.3) Decreasing the Cl2 content at high pressures, e.g., 90mTorr, from 90% Cl2 content 
(a) Collapse of self-coagulation-to-coil

(f) 5% Cl2 contents, given by fluid simulation at 300W and 90mTorr.   

In Fig. 14, the Cl- anion densities at different Cl2 contents are plotted, at the high pressure of 90mTorr and 
300W  power  of Ar/Cl2  inductive  plasma.  It  is  seen  that  when  decreasing  Cl2  content,  the  known  self-
coagulation-to-coil  (SCC)  phenomenon  (reported  in  Ref.  [16])  is  disappeared  gradually  and  hollow  Cl- 
anion density is constructed at low enough Cl2 content, i.e., 5%, in Fig. 14(f).

(b) Hollow anion density and grouping effect   
The hollow anion density profile is more clearly exhibited along the axis in Fig. 15. Moreover, the plasma 
species are grouped (novel and interesting behavior) in Fig. 16. Concretely, the electron and the cation pair 
of Ar+ and Cl+ are grouped as their density profiles are the same, coagulated to the coil. Correspondingly, 
the  left  Cl-  anion  and  Cl2
+  cation  species  are  grouped,  both  displaying  the  hollow  density  profile.  This 
grouping can be further demonstrated through the charge density in Fig. 17. In Fig. 17(a) the deduct of 
electron density from the pair of Ar+ and Cl+ is plotted and in Fig. 17(b) the deduct of Cl- density from the 
+ is plotted. As compared, they generate the charge densities with just opposite polarities. When summed 
Cl2
all charged species, the final net charge density is expressed in Fig. 17(c). The basic double layer structure 
is more or less seen, which surrounds the weak red positive “charge cloud”, defined as grouping potential 
(one more plasma non-neutrality type).

Why  the  hollow  anion  density  is  happened  when  decreasing  Cl2  content?  Because  of  the  shortage  of 
feedstock  reactive  gas,  Cl2  molecule. As  shown  in  Fig.  18,  at  5%  Cl2  and  90mTorr,  as  increasing  the 
simulating time in fluid model simulation, the creation rate of Cl- anion, i.e., attachments of electron with 
Cl2, at first peaks under the coil and then sinks, finally exhibiting centric hollow shape, implying that the 
feedstock Cl2 molecules have been severely depleted. In Fig. 19, the Cl2 density at the different times of 
Fig.  18  are  plotted. As  seen,  the  feedstock  is  indeed  consumed  because  of  the  small  Cl2  content  in  the 
feeding gas mixture.

inductive plasma at 300W, 5% Cl2 content and 90mTorr.   

In Fig. 20, the densities of neutrals, Cl2, Cl and Ar, at 5% Cl2 and 90mTorr are plotted. In Fig. 21, the axial 
profiles of these three densities under the dielectric window are given. It is seen that the Ar and Cl densities 
are high and the Cl2 density is about two or three orders lower than the Ar and Cl at the discharge center. 
This explains well the grouping effect, for Ar and Cl mainly generate Ar+ and Cl+, while Cl2 gives rise to 
+ and Cl-, from the point view of chemistry. That’s why the electron (always at enough feedstock) and 
Cl2
+ are grouped. The latter is in the condition of 
the pair of Ar+ and Cl+ cations are grouped, and Cl- and Cl2
feedstock gas shortage while the former is not.

window.   

(d) Electron coagulates at ambi-polar diffusion, without any self-coagulation   
In Fig. 22, the electron density and potential contour of 5% Cl2 and 90mTorr Ar/Cl2 plasma are given. As 
seen,  when  the  self-coagulation-to-coil  scheme  is  destroyed  by  the  shortage  of  reactive  feedstock,  the 
electron  coagulation  shape  is  different.  It  does  not  attach  the  dielectric  window  anymore  without  the 
influence of ions self-coagulation. This natural coagulation of electron is one general electropositive plasma 
characteristic. It originates from the fact that the electron ionization frequency of chemical term cannot be 
taken as constant in the electron continuity equation at high pressure, which is originated from the non-
uniformity of electron temperature. Hence, the trigonometric or Bessel profile (i.e., the analytic solutions 
of continuity equation at constant frequency [5]) is not given, but forming the coagulated one. This is thus 
called the physical coagulation, relative to the chemical self-coagulation of ions (in electronegative core). 
Besides, the electron Boltzmann balance with plasma potential is automatically met as the peripheric self-
coagulation of electron is neither happened herein (strong potential barrel at weak electronegativity).

In Fig. 23, when decreasing pressure at low Cl2 content, 5%, the hollow anion density is disappeared and 
the delta type anion is reoccurred at 10mTorr. Furthermore, the grouping effect is disappeared as well. As 
shown in Fig. 24, at 10mTorr and 5% Cl2, all cations densities hold the delta part as anion, at the advective 
ambi-polar self-coagulation.

(b) Refreshment of reactive feedstock gas and de-coagulation of electron 

Figure 25 Electron density peak versus gas pressure, at 300W and 5% Cl2 content, at fluid simulation.   

The disappearance of hollow anion and group effect is because electron density is low at low pressure in 
Fig.  25,  which  consumes  less  feedstock  gases.  So,  the  reactive  feedstock  gas  is  refreshed.  Hence,  the 
creation rate of anion is not centrically sunk at decreasing the pressure, as shown in Fig. 26. In Fig. 27, the 
Ar, Cl and Cl2 densities axial profiles of 10mTorr and 5% Cl2 are plotted. It is seen that the Cl2 feedstock 
is just two times lower than the Ar and Cl, illustrating the group disappearance (for all charges species are 
now in enough feedstocks). In Fig. 28, it is shown that the electron coagulation is disappeared and it turns 
back to the trigonometric (along axis) and basic Bessel (along radius) profiles on decreasing the pressure 
at low Cl2 content. This is logic, since at low pressure the transport (with larger diffusion coefficient and 
mobility than the high pressure) dominates over the chemical term, and the spatial variation of ionization 
frequency is negligible in the electron continuity equation. It is noted that due to the influence of delta anion, 
the radial profile of electron density herein is slightly deviated from the Bessel function, just as illustrated 
in our previous Ar/O2 inductive plasma [17].

IV. Conclusion and further remarks 

Figure  29  (Partial)  overview  of  the  cyclic  study  with  respect  to  discharge  conditions,  i.e.,  pressure  and 
reactive gas content concentration, at fixed power 300W and in the inductive Ar/Cl2 plasma given by fluid 
model simulation.   
Partial contents of the cyclic study involving the pressure and Cl2 content parameters of inductive Ar/Cl2 
plasma at fixed power (300W) are schematically illustrated in one transformed Cartesian coordinate system, 
as shown in Fig. 29. The x axis represents the Cl2 content, and y axis represents pressure, respectively. The 
origin of this system is about the delta anion, which is formed at 10mTorr and 5% Cl2 content. Anion self-
coagulation produces its own delta and cation delta is led to by the ambi-polar self-coagulation. So, the 
delta ions (here referring to both anion and cation) term is appeared at the origin. At the center of drawn 
rectangle, the word, self-coagulation, is written, implying its importance and influence in almost all the 
processes occurring in the cycle. At increasing the Cl2 content (along x axis) from the delta origin (O vertex 
of  rectangle),  after  experiencing  the  space-stratification  and  core  expansion,  the  parabola  ions  model  is 
obtained, at 10mTorr and 90% Cl2 content (vertex A). When increasing the pressure from the parabola ions, 
at the influence of so-called recombination loss flux, parabola turns into flat-topped model at 90mTorr and 
90% Cl2 content (vertex B). When decreasing the Cl2 content at high pressure, the reactive feedstock gas 
shortage is met, and the partial hollow ions model is predicted, at 90mTorr and 5% Cl2 content (vertex C). 
Eventually, when decreasing pressure (along y axis) back to 10mTorr at 5% Cl2, the transport dominates 
over source term, and the delta ions model is re-obtained. This constructed rectangle describes the processes 
occurred in the cycle that are easily edited using this coordinate method (that’s why a “partial” word is 
added in front of the overview in the caption of Fig. 29). It is stressed there are still many other important 
mechanisms, e.g., species-stratification (predicted by the analytics and repeated by simulation) hidden in 
the  delta,  concept  of  the  gentle  ambi-polar  self-coagulation,  drift  essence  of  cation  in  the  ambi-polar 
diffusion-self-coagulation, collapse of the self-coagulation-to-coil scheme, discharge  grouping  effect,  as 
well as the chemical (self-) and physical (ionization frequency is not constant) coagulations of electron and 
its de-coagulation. Besides, the diverse non-neutralities of plasma discovered at present are summarized, 
analyzed,  and classified, which helps  people greatly understand the  complex plasma. All  these contents

comprise this article. 
Via the self-consistent  fluid  simulations,  this  article, together with  its twin paper [16] mainly about  the 
Ar/SF6 inductive discharge, predicts so many new phenomena occurred in electronegative plasmas. From 
the  tightly  correlative  analytic  theories,  all  the  new  behaviors  are  well  interpreted,  reliable  to  readers. 
However, the validation of them through experiments is still needed, satisfying develop rules of scientific 
knowledges. This becomes our next work emphasis. Besides, the influences of other fluid model factors, 
such  as  inertia  term,  neutral  gas  heating  and  convection,  and  elaborate  chemical  reactions,  on  these 
mechanisms are also very meaningful tasks, deserving careful considerations.
