ABSTRACT

Aims. Recent simulations of solar magneto-convection has oﬀered new levels of understanding of the interplay between plasma mo-
tions and magnetic ﬁelds in evolving active regions. We aim at verifying some aspects of the formation of magnetic regions derived
from recent numerical studies in observational data.
Methods. We studied the formation of a pore in the active region (AR) NOAA 11462. We analysed data obtained with the
Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope on April 17, 2012, consisting of full Stokes mea-
surements of the Fe I 617.3 nm lines. Furthermore, we analysed SDO/HMI observations in the continuum and vector magnetograms
derived from the Fe I 617.3 nm line data taken from April 15 to 19, 2012. We estimated the magnetic ﬁeld strength and vector com-
ponents and the line-of-sight (LOS) and horizontal motions in the photospheric region hosting the pore formation. We discuss our
results in light of other observational studies and recent advances of numerical simulations.
Results. The pore formation occurs in less than 1 hour in the leading region of the AR. We observe that the evolution of the ﬂux
patch in the leading part of the AR is faster (¡ 12 hour) than the evolution (20-30 hour) of the more diﬀuse and smaller scale ﬂux
patches in the trailing region. During the pore formation, the ratio between magnetic and dark area decreases from 5 to 2. We observe
strong downﬂows at the forming pore boundary and diverging proper motions of plasma in the vicinity of the evolving feature that are
directed towards the forming pore. The average values and trends of the various quantities estimated in the AR are in agreement with
results of former observational studies of steady pores and with their modelled counterparts, as seen in recent numerical simulations
of a rising-tube process. The agreement with the outcomes of the numerical studies holds for both the signatures of the ﬂux emergence
process (e.g. appearance of small-scale mixed polarity patterns and elongated granules) and the evolution of the region. The processes
driving the formation of the pore are identiﬁed with the emergence of a magnetic ﬂux concentration and the subsequent reorganization
of the emerged ﬂux, by the combined eﬀect of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld, in and around the evolving structure.

pores (e.g. Cho et al. 2010, 2013; Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2010;
Toriumi et al. 2014), show that these features are small sunspots
without penumbra and with a prevailing vertical magnetic ﬁeld
that can reach up to 1-2 kG strength in the photosphere (e.g.
Sobotka et al. 2012). The periphery of pores displays strong
downﬂows with plasma velocities that decrease with the atmo-
spheric height; supersonic ﬂows were also reported in the chro-
mosphere (e.g. Lagg et al. 2007; Sobotka et al. 2012; Cho et al.
2013; Sobotka et al. 2013, and references therein). Converging
horizontal motions appear around pores with velocities twice
as high as those found inside them and the highest values
near the border of the pores (e.g. Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2012;
Verma & Denker 2014, and references therein). Like sunspots,
pores host ﬁne bright features and several types of waves (e.g.
Balthasar et al. 2000; Bogdan & Judge 2006; Stangalini et al.
2011, 2012).

High-resolution observations show that pores are formed by
the merging of small magnetic elements dragged together by
plasma motions (e.g. Sobotka (2003); Yang et al. (2003), and
references therein). However, until recent times, limited diag-
nostic capabilities have impeded the understanding of whether
the above process results from emergence through the photo-
sphere of a magnetic ﬁeld generated by global dynamo mecha-

nisms in the solar interior, or from ampliﬁcation and structuring
of a magnetic ﬁeld generated by local convective dynamo due to
plasma motions. Current spectro-polarimetric instruments and
methods, and recent numerical simulations promise to oﬀer new
levels of understanding of the processes involved in the forma-
tion of pores and larger scale magnetic structures; see for ex-
ample the observational studies by Schlichenmaier et al. (2010),
Rezaei et al. (2012), Bello Gonz´alez et al. (2012), Romano et al.
(2013, 2014), and Watanabe et al. (2014) concerning the con-
ditions that lead to the formation of penumbral regions, and
the three-dimensional (3D) radiative magneto-hydro-dynamic
(MHD) simulations of ﬂux emergence by Rempel & Cheung
(2014).

In this framework, we hereby study the evolution of a mag-
netic region that led a diﬀuse dipolar ﬂux patch to form a pore,
and, at a later stage, dipolar sunspot groups in AR 11462. We
analyse a unique ground-based spectro-polarimetric data set ac-
quired during the pore formation, and complement these obser-
vations with space-borne data from the SDO mission. We focus
on the photospheric processes related to the pore formation by
investigating the physical conditions in the whole evolving re-
gion as observed on timescales longer than about 10 minutes.
The data and methods employed are presented in Sect. 2, while
the results obtained are described in Sect. 3. We discuss our ﬁnd-
ings in light of other observational studies and the minute out-
comes of recent simulations, and then draw our conclusions in
Sect. 4.

2. Data and methods

2.1. Observations

The region analysed in our study was observed with the
Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS; Cavallini
2006) at
the Dunn Solar Telescope of the National Solar
Observatory (NSO/DST) on April 17, 2012, from 13:58 UT to
20:43 UT, within the AR NOAA 11462 (hereafter referred to
as AR), at initial disk position [S24, E0.3]. The observations
were assisted by the adaptive optics system of the NSO/DST
(Rimmele et al. 2004), under fair conditions of atmospheric see-
ing. No data were acquired between 16:30 UT and 18:30 UT
because of a worsening of the seeing started at about 16:15 UT.
The IBIS data consist of 223 sequences, each contain-
ing narrowband ﬁltergrams derived from a 24-, 30-, and 25-
point scan of the Fe I 617.3 nm, Fe I 630.2 nm, and Ca II
854.2 nm lines, respectively, over a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of
≈ 40×90 arcsec2 with a cadence of 67 s. The Fe I data in-
clude sequential measurements of the six polarization states
[I+Q, I+V, I-Q, I-V, I-U, I+U] at each wavelength position
of the line sampling (FWHM 2 pm, step 2 pm), while the Ca
II data (FWHM 4.4 pm, step 4.4 pm) include only Stokes I
measurements. Each measurement consists of a single ﬁlter-
gram taken with an integration time of 60 ms and pixel scale
of ≈ 0.09 arcsec. The above data are complemented with simul-
taneous broadband ﬁltergrams obtained at 633.32 ± 5 nm with
the same exposure time and FOV of the narrowband data for the
post-facto image restoration.

In this study we focus on the available Fe I 617.3 nm line
data; according to Norton et al. (2006), the excitation potential,
eﬀective Land´e factor, and average line-formation height of the
Fe I 617.3 nm line are 2.22 eV, 2.5, and 250-350 km, respec-
tively.

The AR evolution was also studied by analysing the
data obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager

(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) aboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). In particu-
lar, we analysed the Level 1.5 SDO/HMI photospheric full-disk
ﬁltergrams and magnetograms at the Fe I 617.3 nm line taken
from April 15 to April 19, 2012, when the AR longitudinal
distance was within ± 30◦ of the central meridian. The data
consist of ≈ 500 images, each 4096 × 4096 pixels, with pixel
size of 0.505 arcsec and cadence of 720 s. Additional infor-
mation about the AR was derived from the SDO/HMI Space-
weather Active Region Patches (SHARP; Hoeksema et al. 2014;
Bobra et al. 2014) maps obtained during the same time interval
of the other SDO data.

2.2. Methods

The IBIS observations were processed with the standard re-
duction pipeline1 to compensate data for the dark and ﬂat-
ﬁeld response of the CCD devices,
instrumental blueshift,
and instrument- and telescope-induced polarizations. Besides,
they were also restored for seeing-induced degradations, us-
ing the Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution technique (MFBD;
van Noort et al. 2005, and references therein).

To get quantitative estimates of the physical parameters in
the observed region, we performed spectro-polarimetric inver-
sions of a subset of the IBIS measurements with the SIR code
(Ruiz Cobo & del Toro Iniesta 1992; Bellot Rubio 2003). We
selected 20 time intervals during the IBIS observations that track
the evolution of the region under good and stable seeing condi-
tions. We processed, with the SIR code, a sub-array of 360×350
pixels extracted from the selected data and centred on the evolv-
ing feature.

Following

approaches

Requerey et al.

e.g.
Asensio Ramos et al.
(2015);
Buehler et al. (2016), and references therein), we performed the
data inversion by considering one component plus a stray-light
component of unspeciﬁed amplitude. This latter component
thus acts as a free parameter. Depending on the amount of
polarization in each pixel, we considered the ﬁrst component to
be magnetic or quiet. We deﬁned the magnetized pixels as those
in which the total circular polarization signal is ≥ 2 times the
standard deviation of the signal estimated over the sub-array.
Examples of the identiﬁed regions are given in Fig. B.1, which
is available online. We considered the Harvard−Smithsonian
Reference Atmosphere (HSRA; Gingerich et al. 1971) as
an initial guess model for the quiet regions and the same
model, but modiﬁed with an initial value for the magnetic
ﬁeld strength of 0.2 kG, for the magnetized regions. We
performed the data inversion by applying two computa-
tional cycles, each one including up to 30 iterations. At
the ﬁrst cycle, we considered all modelled quantities to be
constant along the LOS and assigned them one node. At the
second cycle, we added one node in the temperature. The
magnetic ﬁeld strength, inclination, azimuth, LOS velocity,
and micro-turbulent velocity, however, were considered to
be constant with height, i.e. the temperature was assigned
two nodes, and the other quantities were given one node.
The two nodes were set at log(τ) = 1.4 and log(τ) = -4. Since
we performed one-component
the magnetic
ﬁlling factor is equal to unity; we set the macroturbulent
velocity to 0.75 km/s. For quiet Sun region pixels, we gave
the I measurements four times the statistical weight of the
Q, U, V proﬁles; for magnetized region pixels, we did the

inversions,

opposite. At each iteration, the synthetic proﬁles derived
from the solution of the radiative transfer equation were
also convolved with the spectral response function of IBIS
(Reardon & Cavallini 2008) and weighted by considering
the stray-light contamination on the data. We estimated the
latter quantity by averaging Stokes I spectra in a region
characterized by low polarization degree over the inverted
sub-array, as in for example Bellot Rubio et al. (2000).

We tested the accuracy of the results obtained for diﬀerent
initializations of the inversions and chose the initialization that
produced the best ﬁt between the synthesized proﬁle and mea-
surement over each pixel and the largest physical consistency of
the estimated quantities over the whole FOV inverted. We found
that increasing the number of inversion cycles did not further
improve the result of our calculation; on average less than 12-
15 iterations allowed the computational convergence. Examples
of the results obtained and comparisons between the observed
and inverted proﬁles at 20 positions on the analysed sub-FOVs
are given in Figs. B.1-B.8, which are available online. Values
of the stray-light fraction, LOS magnetic ﬁeld strength, ﬁeld in-
clination and azimuth, and LOS velocity derived from our data
analysis at the same positions of the compared proﬁles are listed
in Tables B.1-B.7, which are available online.

We then transformed the magnetic ﬁeld inclination and az-
imuth derived from the data inversions into the local solar frame
(LSF). We resolved the 180 degree ambiguity of the azimuth an-
gle via the NPFC code (Georgoulis 2005).

In order to describe the horizontal proper motions in the IBIS
FOV and estimate their velocity, vH, we applied the Fourier lo-
cal correlation tracking method (FLCT; Fisher & Welsch 2008,
and references therein) to the available line-continuum data. We
set the FWHM of the Gaussian tracking window to 0.5 arcsec
to properly track magnetic structures with spatial scales smaller
than the typical granular size; we made the temporal integration
over a 13 minute time interval. Finally, we computed the plasma
LOS velocity, vLOS , by the Doppler shifts of line cores with re-
spect to the average quiet Sun line centre position in the IBIS
FOV. We computed the reference value for each ﬁltergram of
the analysed series. The series were previously processed with a
subsonic ﬁltering with a phase−velocity cut-oﬀ set to 5 km/s.

We processed the time series of the SDO/HMI data ac-
cording to Ermolli et al. (2014), by extracting from each im-
age the 512×512 pixel2 sub-array centred on the AR baricentre.
Besides, we produced photospheric velocity maps of the hori-
zontal plasma motions via the diﬀerential aﬃne velocity esti-
mator method for vector magnetograms (DAVE4VM; Schuck
2006) on the SDO/HMI SHARP data. In particular, following
Schuck (2008), we derived persistent plasma motions by com-
paring magnetograms taken 24 minute apart with a 5.5 arcsec
FWHM apodization window.

3.1. AR evolutionand pore formation

The AR was observed on the solar disk from April 16 to April
22, 2012, when it reached the western limb. Figure 1 shows the
AR as seen in the SDO/HMI observations taken at given times
from April 16, 2012, 12:00 UT, to April 19, 2012, 10:48 UT. In
each panel, we show the subﬁeld of ≈ 160×170 arcsec2, centred
on the AR, that was analysed to describe the evolution of the
magnetic ﬁeld and radiative ﬂux in the AR. We also show (Fig.
1 column 2) the two parts (sFOV) of the above subﬁeld that were
considered to describe the evolution of the trailing (negative) and

analysing the subﬁeld shown in Figs. 1 (solid line), and the leading and
trailing parts of the same subﬁeld separately (dotted and dashed lines,
respectively). The black, red, and blue lines indicate the total, positive,
and negative magnetic ﬂux, respectively. The vertical lines show the
time interval of the IBIS observations (solid), the times the data shown

to April 18, 2012 (dotted). The additional axis indicates calendar days
at 00:00 UT. For clarity, ﬂux values are only shown from data taken
with a cadence of 36 minute.

leading (positive) polarity regions in the AR, sFOVt and sFOVl,
respectively. The full temporal evolution of the analysed subﬁeld
is shown in the movie attached to Fig. 1.

According to the NOAA/USAF active region summary, in
the early stages of its evolution, the AR consists of seven tiny
ﬁeld features organized to form a diﬀuse dipolar ﬂux region,
which is seen for example in Fig. 1 (lines a-b). The outermost
available observations of the AR consists of several sunspots and
pores, which are already seen in the observations taken on April
19, 2012 and shown, for example in Fig. 1 (line h).

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the magnetic ﬂux (top and
middle panels) and ﬂux derivative (bottom panel) in the AR,
from the SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms taken from April 16
00:00 UT to April 18 12:00 UT, 2012, over the subﬁeld and the
two sFOVs shown in Fig. 1 and in the attached movie. The to-
tal unsigned magnetic ﬂux (Btot) emerged in the AR (Fig. 2, top
panel) remains almost constant with values below 4×1021 Mx
till April 17, 2012, ≈ 12:00 UT, then it undergoes an increase.

The ﬂux evolution points out an increased ﬂux of compara-
ble magnitude in both the sFOVl and sFOVt on April 17, 2012,
between 9:30 UT and 12:30 UT, before the start of the IBIS
measurements (Fig. 2, middle and bottom panels). This ﬂux in-
crease, which is consistent with the ﬂux increase by a rising-tube
process, precedes the formation of a ﬁlamentary, weak S-shaped
structure and occurred in sFOVl between ≈ 12:30 UT and 13:30
UT. The IBIS measurements targeted the evolution that leads the
above ﬁlamentary structure, of positive polarity ﬂux, to form a
pore, on April 17, 2012 from 13:58 UT to 20:43 UT. Figure 1
(line c) shows the FOV of the IBIS data, whose examples are
given in Fig. 3.

The time interval of the IBIS measurements is character-
ized by a steep increase of ﬂux in the AR lasting until April
17, 2012, ≈ 17:00 UT (Fig. 2, middle and bottom panels) and
small ﬂux changes afterwards. Available observations show
that on April 17, 2012 between 15:15 UT and 15:30 UT the

right end of the initial S-shaped structure breaks away at
roughly one-third of the length of the structure. After the
break, the right end of the structure evolves to form the pore,
which at some ﬁrst stages resembles a tiny U-shaped (e.g.
SDO/HMI observations at 15:36 UT), then a trident-shaped
structure (e.g. 16:09 UT, IBIS data in Fig. 3, column 2). In
the early stages of its evolution, the S-shaped structure is
aligned to about 10 degree to the east-west direction (Fig.
3, column 1). The IBIS observations show elongated gran-
ules near the evolving structure, mostly located east of this
structure in agreement with, for instance Centeno (2012) and
Verma et al. (2016); these granules are oriented almost per-

I. Ermolli et al.: Velocity and magnetic ﬁelds in a forming pore

pendicularly to the axis of the evolving feature at the early
stages of its evolution and parallel to it later on (see e.g. the
IBIS observations in Fig. 3 line a, granules indicated by the
red bar in each panel).

The formation of the positive polarity pore is accompa-
nied by the emergence of small-scale magnetic features of op-
posite polarity. Indeed, since the early stages of the pore for-
mation, i.e. between 10:00 UT and 12:00 UT and more exten-
sively after 14:00 UT, the SDO/HMI observations show a tiny
magnetic patch of negative polarity ﬂux that emerges north-
east of the evolving, positive ﬂux structure, at about 100 de-
gree to the east-west direction (see e.g. the movie attached to
Fig. 1). This diﬀuse negative polarity patch mostly lies out-
side the FOV of the IBIS observations. It nearly preserves
the same size during the pore formation, but similar sized
negative ﬂux features appear south of it (e.g. the SDO/HMI
observations at 16:12 UT in the movie attached to Fig. 1).
The negative polarity features show clear links to the evolv-
ing, positive polarity region. This suggests that they belong
to the same emerging ﬂux loop from which the AR evolution
could be ensued. The negative patches are clearly seen on
the available data at the time the pore has already increased
signiﬁcantly in size. Near the evolving positive ﬂux struc-
ture, the SDO/HMI magnetograms also show small-scale,
mixed polarity features that counterstream; as seen in the
movie attached to Fig. 1, the negative ﬂux moves towards
the sFOVt, while the positive polarity ﬂux moves towards the
sFOVl. This arrangement of opposite polarity ﬂux resembles
the footpoints of an emerging loop. The SDO/HMI magne-
tograms show the growth of ﬂux regions by coalescence of
smaller scale, same polarity features. This process also shows
up as short-lived, small-scale light features observed in the
photospheric available observations, in both the SDO/HMI
and IBIS data, near the eastward side (leftmost) of the evolv-
ing structure.

Both the SDO/HMI and IBIS observations reveal a counter-
clockwise rotation of the growing pore, which is clearly seen
as a swirling motion of the plasma immediately outside the
western (rightmost) border of the evolving structure. Figure 4
shows some maps of the horizontal motions derived from the
SDO/HMI data; the full evolution of all the computed maps is
shown in the movie attached to Fig. 4. In these maps, the arrows
were plotted to show persistent motions (¿ 12 min) at moderate
resolution (¿ 2 arcsec). Figure 4 and the attached movie show
the above-mentioned rotation on larger size regions of both po-
larities in the AR with velocities up to about 1 km/s (see e.g.
the maps at 16:00 UT and 19:12 UT). In addition, they also dis-
play an outwards motion of the formed pore, with respect to the
primary ﬂux patch, and a drift of the negative polarity ﬂux in
the opposite direction (see e.g. the maps at 19:12 UT and 20:48
UT). As seen on the movies available online, all together these
plasma motions seem to foster the accumulation of ﬂux. Figure
4 also shows that, after the pore formation, the average velocity
of the horizontal plasma motions at the evolving region reduces
to about 0.3-0.4 km/s (Fig. 4, bottom panel).

Throughout the duration of the IBIS observations, the coher-
ent structure resulting from the evolution of the S-shaped feature
displays a fragmented, changing core in the IBIS 617.3 nm data
and lack of penumbra around its entire perimeter. The formed
pore shows a rather symmetric funnel-shaped structure (Fig. 3,
column 4) that lasts about 9 hours. During the same time inter-
val, the ﬁeld aggregation in the trailing (negative) polarity region
forms in a smaller scale (¡ 10 arcsec) and more diﬀuse features.
While the pore is formed in the leading region in less than 1

pore formation to several hour after. The arrows indicate the horizontal
velocity; red (light blue) shows the leading (trailing), positive (negative)
polarity. In all panels but the ﬁrst, the studied pore coincides with the
largest size structure in the leading region. The magnetic ﬁeld in the

hour, the more diﬀuse and smaller scale magnetic structures on
the trailing region show a more gradual increase in ﬂux over a
time interval of 20-30 hours.

On April 18-22, 2012, the total magnetic ﬂux estimated in
the evolving region slightly increases by remaining almost con-
stant for about 24 hour, and then it increases up to values close
to 9×1021 Mx (not shown in Fig. 2). This second ﬂux increase
follows the formation of a partial penumbra around the formed
pore (Fig. 1, line g). This ﬂux leads, in about 10 hours, to the
ﬁnal conﬁguration of the region, which consists of a spot in the
leading polarity region of the AR, two smaller spots in the same
area, and several pores in the trailing ﬂux region of the AR (Fig.
1, line h). The leading spot shows a partial penumbra on the side
opposite from the following polarity of the AR, as reported, for
example by Schlichenmaier et al. (2010). The steepest change of
the total ﬂux during the analysed time interval occurs during the
formation of coherent magnetic structures eastward of the ma-
ture leading spot in the leading polarity region.

3.2. Magneticand velocityﬁelds during the pore formation

3.2.1. Magnetic ﬁeld

Figure 5 shows examples of the results derived from the SIR in-
version of the IBIS data. In particular, we show the maps of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength (B), and of the ﬁeld inclination (θ), trans-
verse (Bt) and longitudinal (Bl) ﬁeld components in the LSF, at
seven representative stages of the pore formation.

The B maps (Fig. 5, column 2) indicate that the ﬁeld ex-
tends beyond the visible outline of the evolving feature during
the whole pore formation; the ﬁeld reaches values up to 1-2 kG
during the entire interval analysed and slightly increases over
time. At the initial stages, the most intense ﬁeld concentrations
are found at the edges of the evolving region; these strong ﬁelds
are located near magnetic ﬁelds with lower strength and oppo-
site polarity than those found in the evolving feature (Fig. 5 lines
b, c), from which they are seen to move away (Fig. 5 lines e-g).
At the initial stages, the magnetic area is 4-5 times larger than
the photometric area, as reported from analysis of an evolving
small AR, for example by Verma et al. (2016), while after the
formation of the coherent feature, the magnetic region is about 2
times larger than the dark structure. At the latter stages, the most
intense ﬁelds are detected in the central-southern region of the
pore. The ﬁeld is almost vertical with respect to the photosphere
in the central section of the evolving feature, and rather inclined
outside it (e.g. Bl and Bt maps in Fig. 5, column 4). Indeed, the
θ maps (Fig. 5, column 3) show a large patch characterized by
values of ≈ 45◦ over an area extending well beyond that of the
evolving feature, which hosts ﬁelds with θ ¡ ≈ 25◦. The θ maps
also show small patches of magnetic ﬁeld characterized by an
inclination of about 90-180◦, which correspond to the opposite
polarity features observed outside the evolving pore, north-east
of it.

After the formation of the coherent, funnel-shaped feature,
the Bt maps (Fig. 5, column 4, lines e-g) show magnetic ﬁelds
that are aligned along the direction of the opposite polarity
patches in the evolving region facing each other. Comparison be-
tween the maps derived from the data taken at the initial (Fig. 5,
lines a-d) and ﬁnal (Fig. 5, lines e-g) evolutionary stages shows
the same azimuth pattern on both the fragmented positive po-
larity patches of the forming pore and the later formed pore.
Therefore, the ﬁelds in the smaller scale, the same polarity fea-
tures, and those in the formed pore are coaligned. Since the for-

6

mer features are seen to coalesce and form the pore, they show
up as the leading footpoints of an emerging dipole.

3.2.2. Line-of-sight and horizontal motions

Figure 6 shows examples of the vLOS and vH maps derived from
the IBIS data at the same stages of the pore formation presented
in Fig. 5.

The vLOS maps (Fig. 6, column 1) show downﬂows (corre-
sponding to positive values in the velocity maps) characterized
by velocities up to 2 km/s in the area of the evolving structure
and its periphery. These downﬂows occur during the whole pore
formation; as the feature evolves, they become stronger, which is
likely as a consequence of the ﬂux coalescence. They are mostly
located at the northern edge of the feature during the initial and
intermediate evolutionary stages (Fig. 6, lines a-d), and at its
eastern and southern sides during the ﬁnal stages (Fig. 6, lines
e-g). Upﬂows are suppressed in the evolving region during most
of its evolution (Fig. 6, lines a-d), while they appear after the
pore formation mostly at its western region (Fig. 6, line g). The
maps also show convective upﬂows around the evolving region
and localized downﬂows, where magnetic ﬂux accumulates (e.g.
Fig. 6, lines c, d, g, to the left side of the map). These plasma mo-
tions are also characterized by velocities up to about 1-2 km/s.
It is worth noting that the positive (negative) values of plasma
velocity shown with red (blue) colours in the vLOS maps do not
correspond to pure downﬂows (upﬂows) since they were derived
from analyses of observations taken oﬀ disc centre.

The vH maps (Fig. 6, column 2) show plasma motions
in agreement with those inferred from the analysis of the
SDO/HMI observations (Fig. 4). However, with respect to the
latter maps, those in Fig. 6 more clearly represent the diverg-
ing motions of plasma seen from the visual inspection of the
available data in the close proximity of the evolving region. At
the initial stages of the pore formation, there are horizontal mo-
tions at both sides of the elongated evolving structure (Fig. 6,
lines a-b), inwards to its upper (northern) edge and outwards
beyond its lower (southern) boundary; these motions push the
evolving feature forward. At these stages, the vH maps obtained
from the IBIS data also clearly show the swirling motion of the
plasma in the area of the evolving feature (see e.g. Fig. 6 lines a,
d). After the pore formation, the maps show coherent motions
inwards directed around most of the eastward visible outline
of the pore (Fig. 6, line g). After the formation of the funnel-
shaped structure, the highest values in the vH maps are found to
be located far from the visible outline of the evolving structure,
at a distance of about 5-10 arcsec, as reported for example by
Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. (2010).

3.2.3. Temporal evolution

Figure 7 shows the evolution of the physical quantities discussed
above, as derived from the SIR inversion and other methods ap-
plied to the IBIS data. Each panel represents the average and
standard deviation of the various quantities estimated inside and
around the evolving feature.

Inside the evolving feature, B varies from about 1 kG to 2 kG,
by reaching average values larger than 1.5 kG after the formation
of the funnel-shaped pore (Fig. 7, top panel). The maximum (not
shown in Fig. 7) and average values of B increase in time, as
well as the same quantities for both the Bt and Bl components.
Outside the forming pore, the average value of B ranges between
0 kG and 0.1 kG, but there are regions in this area with magnetic

spheric Fe I 617.3 nm line data during the pore formation, inside (black

mean and standard deviation of the values derived from the data inver-
sion and other methods described in Sect. 2. Field, angle, and velocity
values are given in kG, degree, and km/s units, respectively. For the
sake of clarity, the standard deviation is shown only for magnetic ﬁeld
strength, inclination, and vLOS estimates, inside and around the evolving
structure. The vertical dotted lines show the time interval lacking IBIS
observations. The numbers in the upper panel indicate the seven times
corresponding to the evolutionary stages shown in Figs. 5, 6.

ﬁeld strength ≥ 1 kG. The average value of B over the whole
area does not change signiﬁcantly during the pore formation;
the same holds for both the mean value of B over the stronger
ﬁeld elements and the maximum value of Bt in the whole area,
while the maximum values of Bl and B outside the evolving pore
slightly decrease (≤ 10 %) over time.

During the interval of the IBIS observations, θ does not
change signiﬁcantly (Fig. 7, middle panel). The average and the
range of vLOS values measured over the magnetic region slightly
decrease after the pore formation, compared to those estimated
in previous stages (Fig. 7, bottom panel); outside the evolving
pore, the velocity of the plasma motions does not change signif-
icantly over the analysed period.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The results derived from our analysis agree with the outcomes
of former studies of steady pores mentioned above; speciﬁcally,
with the magnetic ﬁeld patterns and strengths presented, for ex-
ample by Sobotka et al. (2012), and the vLOS and vH reported by
Cho et al. (2010), Sobotka et al. (2012), Sobotka et al. (2013),
and Verma et al. (2016), for example. However, unlike previous
studies, our data also allow us to investigate the properties of
the photospheric plasma in the evolving region during the pore
formation, and thus provide further observational constraints to
numerical models of the AR evolution.

Magnetic ﬁelds and ﬂuid motions are coupled according to
the equations of the magnetohydrodynamics in 3D space and
time. Cheung et al. (2008) performed simulations to investigate
the interaction between convection and a magnetic ﬂux tube ris-
ing into the photosphere, and discussed the outcomes with re-
spect to observations from the HINODE mission. They reported

velocity ﬁelds in the evolving region derived from the IBIS Fe I 617.3
nm data at the seven stages (lines a-g) of the pore formation shown in

red (positive) vLOS indicate upﬂows and downﬂows, respectively. The
intensity background in the vH maps shows the average image of the
representative series. In panel 2a, the horizontal blue bar indicates vH
plasma velocity of 1 km/s.

that the rising ﬂux tube expands because of the strong stratiﬁca-
tion of the convective zone by forming a magnetic sheet that acts
as a reservoir for small-scale ﬂux emergence events occurring
at the scale of granulation. They also found that the interaction
of the convective downﬂows and the rising magnetic ﬂux tube
undulates it to form serpentine ﬁeld lines that emerge into the
photosphere.

Later on, from an in-depth progression of the above simu-
lations to the formation of an AR, Cheung et al. (2010) showed
that the above serpentine ﬁelds gradually coalesce to form larger
magnetic concentrations that eventually form a pair of opposite
polarity spots. They also pointed out that correlations between
the magnetic ﬁeld and velocity ﬁeld ﬂuctuations allow the spots
to accumulate ﬂux by Lorentz-force-driven, counter streaming
motion of opposite polarity regions.

From recent 3D MHD investigations of the eﬀects of inﬂows
in the evolution of ARs, Rempel & Cheung (2014) reported that,
in their simulated photosphere, the ﬂux appears organized on a
granular scale with mostly mixed polarity with magnetic ﬂux of
the order 1021 Mx and average value lower than 0.1 kG. After
emergence, the simulated dipoles undergo horizontal diverging
ﬂows, reaching an amplitude of up to 2 km/s. In the numerical
domain, these motions produce a progressive separation of the
polarity of the dipoles that migrate in the opposite direction, by
moving the opposite polarity ﬂux away from the emergence re-
gions.

Stein et al.

The above simulations have contributed to a long series of
numerical studies aimed at the identiﬁcation of the mechanisms
responsible for the formation and evolution of solar magnetic
structures (see e.g. Cameron et al. (2007, 2011), Cheung et al.
(2012b,a, 2014), Kitiashvili et al.
(2008, 2010), Fang et al.
(2012); Mart´ınez-Sykora et al.
(2010), Martinez-Sykora
(2015),
(2012),
to mention those that
Toriumi & Yokoyama (2012, 2013),
have been presented during the last decade). Although these
studies can strongly diﬀer in terms of the initial conditions and
scales of the simulated processes, they have all reproduced
some ﬂux evolution signatures in agreement with observations.
Hence the question arises on which processes unveiled by
the numerical studies can be considered robust with both the
observations and model assumptions.

Stein & Nordlund

(2011);

In this regard, the data analysed in our study show several
observational facts that are consistent with the outcomes of the
MHD simulations presented by Rempel & Cheung (2014). In
particular, we found as follows:

– At the initial stages of the AR evolution, the analysed obser-
vations display mixed polarity ﬂux patches organized on a
granular scale; the ﬂux patches in the trailing region of the
forming AR are more clearly seen than those in the leading
part (e.g. Fig. 1 and attached movie).

– After about 24 hours, the patches in the leading part become
stronger than those in the trailing region and form a ﬁlamen-
tary, sheet-like, coherent structure (e.g. movie available on-
line and Figs. 1, 2, 3); these are the observed initial stages of
pore formation.

– At that time, the small-scale mixed polarity patches hold ﬂux
of the order 1021 Mx in an evolving region with an average
ﬁeld below 0.1 kG (e.g. Figs. 1, 2, 5).

– The ﬂux then shows an increase of comparable magnitude in
both polarity patches of the evolving region (e.g. Fig. 2).
– At a later time, the data clearly display small-scale opposite
polarity features that counterstream, coalesce, and reinforce

ﬂux accumulation at distinct sites (e.g. movie available on-
line and Fig. 4).

– At that time, elongated granules appear in close proximity of
the evolving feature, mostly located in the region the oppo-
site polarities of the evolving AR facing each other (e.g. Fig.
3);

– The pore increases in size, while the sites of ﬂux accumu-
lation move away from each other with clear horizontal di-
verging motions and a rather small increase of the average
ﬁeld in the forming pore (e.g. Figs. 4, 5, 6).

– Horizontal diverging motions seem to produce further ag-
gregation of ﬁeld of the same polarity (e.g. movies available
online and Figs. 4, 6); the plasma velocity is up to 0.4 km/s
in the forming pore and up to 1 km/s outside it.

– Strong downﬂows, with plasma velocity ¿ 1.5 km/s, appear
near the periphery of the forming pore and where magnetic
ﬂux accumulates (e.g. Fig. 6).

– Most intense ﬁeld concentrations occur near the edges of the
magnetic regions in evolution (e.g. Figs. 5, 6) as due to the
conﬁnement of the ﬁeld by the ambient plasma motions.
– The analysed data show that the pore formation in the lead-
ing region of the AR occurs rapidly (¡ 1 hour); the evolution
of the ﬂux patch in the leading part is faster (¡ 12 hour) than
the evolution (20-30 hour) of the more diﬀuse and smaller
scale ﬂux patches in the trailing region (e.g. supplemental
movies and Fig. 1).

– At the ﬁnal stages of the AR evolution, about 48 hour after
the pore formation, the evolution of the region leads to the
formation of a large-scale AR with a magnetic ﬂux of the
order of 1022 Mx.

From analysis of two relatively isolated ARs observed from
the SDO mission, Centeno (2012) already reported some ob-
servational signatures of AR formation consistent with the 3D
MHD numerical simulation of a rising-tube process, such as
evidence of a connection between horizontal ﬁeld patches and
strong upﬂows, elongated granulation around the evolving ARs,
and a mass discharge process through magnetic reconnection,
as envisaged in the simulations of Cheung et al. (2010) and
Rempel & Cheung (2014), for example. In contrast, from a re-
cent study of HINODE spectro-polarimetric observations of a
young dipolar subregion developing within an AR, Getling et al.
(2016) presented observational results that are considered to
conﬂict with the signatures expected by the emergence of a ﬂux-
tube loop. In particular, they reported a fountain-like 3D mag-
netic structure of the studied features and lack of large-scale
(horizontal and vertical) ﬂows over the evolving area, which are
seen as two pieces of evidence of magnetic region generation
by local convective dynamo mechanisms as envisaged in the 3D
MHD simulations, for example by Stein & Nordlund (2012).

Compared to the HINODE and SDO observations anal-
ysed, for example by Getling et al. (2016) and Centeno
(2012), the IBIS data considered in our study have spatial
and temporal resolution that are higher at least by factors
3.5 and 11, respectively. By analysing the available data, we
found that the simulations of the rising-tube process success-
fully reproduce both the average properties of the physical
quantities estimated in the studied region and the mecha-
nisms driving the observed pore formation. In particular, the
studied pore seems to result from the emergence into the
photosphere of a strong ﬁeld formed in the solar interior,
with some ampliﬁcation and structuring eﬀects of the ini-
tially emerged ﬁeld by surface plasma motions, as evinced
from the simulations for example by Rempel & Cheung

the studied region at diﬀerent spatial and temporal scales
fairly well. The signatures observed in the studied region, in
contrast, diﬀer from those presented by Getling et al. (2016),
which support the scenario of pore and larger scale magnetic
region generation by local convective dynamo mechanisms.

line data, at seven stages of the pore formation at (a) 13:58 UT, (b) 14:26 UT, (c) 15:08 UT, (d) 16:08 UT, (e) 18:44 UT, (f) 19:29 UT, and (g)
20:35 UT. North is at the top; west is to the right. The small black squares in the continuum intensity images show the 20 positions considered for
the comparison between observed and inverted proﬁles in Figs. B.2-B.8. The contour line in the panels of the middle and right columns shows the
location of the evolving structure singled out in the continuum data, as speciﬁed in Fig. 3.

Fig. B.2. From left to right: Examples of observed (black) and inverted (red) Stokes-I, -Q, -U, and -V proﬁles at the 20 positions on the sub-FOV
labelled (a) in Fig. B.1, taken during the pore formation at 13:58 UT. Spectra are normalized to the continuum intensity. Numbers on the bottom
left in each sub-panel of the Stokes-I ﬁgure indicate the position of the analysed pixel expressed in arcsec with respect to the sub-FOV shown
in Fig. B.1. Values of the stray-light fraction, LOS magnetic ﬁeld strength (kG), ﬁeld inclination and azimuth (degree), and LOS velocity (km/s)
derived from our data analysis (at optical depth logτ500 = 1) at the same positions of the shown proﬁles are listed in Table B.1; the values are cut
at 2 decimal digits.

Fig. B.8. As in Fig. B.2 but for the data taken at 20:35 UT (stage (g) of the pore formation shown in Fig. B.1). Values of the stray-light fraction,
LOS magnetic ﬁeld strength (kG), ﬁeld inclination and azimuth (degree), and LOS velocity (km/s) derived from our data analysis (at optical depth
logτ500 = 1) at the same positions of the shown proﬁles are listed in Table B.7; the values are cut at 2 decimal digits.
