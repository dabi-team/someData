ABSTRACT

Short-pulse metrology and dynamic studies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range greatly beneﬁt from interferometric
measurements. In this contribution a Michelson-type all-reﬂective split-and-delay autocorrelator operating in a quasi amplitude
splitting mode is presented. The autocorrelator works under a grazing incidence angle in a broad spectral range (10 nm − 1 µm)
providing collinear propagation of both pulse replicas and thus a constant phase difference across the beam proﬁle. The
compact instrument allows for XUV pulse autocorrelation measurements in the time domain with a single-digit attosecond
precision and a useful scan length of about 1 ps enabling a decent resolution of E/∆E = 2000. Its performance for selected
spectroscopic applications requiring moderate resolution at short wavelengths is demonstrated by characterizing a sharp
electronic transition at 26.6 eV in Ar gas. The absorption of the 11th harmonic of a frequency-doubled Yb-ﬁber laser leads
to the well-known 3s3p64p1P1 Fano resonance of Ar atoms. We benchmark our time-domain interferometry results with a
high-resolution XUV grating spectrometer and ﬁnd an excellent agreement. The common-path interferometer opens up new
opportunities for short-wavelength femtosecond and attosecond pulse metrology and dynamic studies on extreme time scales
in various research ﬁelds.

1 Introduction

Interferometry in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range (XUV) plays a key role in attosecond pulse metrology for more than 20
years1. It has led to a wide range of applications ranging from attosecond spectroscopy2 to coherent diffractive imaging on the
nanoscale using table-top sources3, 4. It is the capability of interferometric methods to access the relative phases and amplitudes
of interfering waves known from optics that is used to track propagating quantum objects, such as charge or spin waves in
matter on extremely short distances and corresponding ultrafast time scales5. Along these lines, phase-sensitive light wave
metrology in time and frequency domain goes hand-in-hand with advanced coherent spectroscopy and imaging applications
using electrons, ions or photons as observable. Experimental breakthroughs, such as watching real-time electronic wave packet
dynamics in atoms6, orbital tomography in molecules7 and optical coherence tomography of solids8, rely on controlling or
detecting the phase of an electromagnetic wave with high precision9, 10.

In typical spectroscopic studies, the signal intensity is recorded, while the phase information is lost. High-resolution XUV
spectrometers provide a resolution (E/∆E), which depends on the diffraction grating period, i. e. the number of illuminated
groves and on the wavelength of the light. Typically, it is on the order of E/∆E = 10 311, while special custom-made gratings
can reach a resolution of up to a few times 10 4. Although these optical elements are not off-the-shelf and very expensive,
they are now utilized in large scale soft x-ray synchrotron beamlines especially for spectroscopic techniques demanding high
resolution, such as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) (see for instance12). An alternative approach is Fourier-transform
(FT) spectroscopy. By its nature, it enables characterization of radiation in both time and frequency domain using a single
instrument. The spectral resolution of such a system depends on the maximum optical-path difference between replicas of the
beam propagating in both interferometer arms13. Thus, it can exceed the spectral resolution of the grating-based analyzers by
orders of magnitude, if very large delays can be used14. Moreover, the resolution is uniform across the entire photon energy
range, which usually is not the case for grating-based spectrometers.

 
 
 
 
 
 
The standard geometry of FT spectrometers employs the typical Michelson-interferometer beam path. Its essential com-
ponent is a beam splitter, which permits for splitting the ﬁeld amplitude of the incoming laser pulse in two identical parts
propagating along two perpendicular interferometer arms. Combining the two replicas with parallel wavefronts on the detector
maximizes the interference contrast. The transfer of the two-arm concept into the short-wavelength range has been demonstrated
for speciﬁc wavelengths based on multi-layer optics15, 16. The main challenge for performing FT spectroscopy in the XUV and
beyond is, however, the design of a beam splitter covering a broad spectral range, reaching high transmission and maintaining a
plane wavefront. To meet these challenges, alternative schemes have been developed in recent years based on either engineering
two source points in close proximity with variable pulse delay or special split-and-delay units, applied to a single radiation
source. In the former scheme, two mutually coherent XUV pulses separated in space and time can be generated by harmonic
generation from two laser pulses focused into a gas jet with the same separation17–19. The latter concept is based on a
conventional half-mirror split-and-delay unit20, 21. Both approaches have already been employed to characterize attosecond
pulse trains in time and frequency domain19, 22 and for spectroscopy at synchrotron radiation facilities14. The major drawback
of these concepts is that the two XUV pulses do not propagate collinearly. Due to the partial overlap in the far ﬁeld, only a
small fraction of the lateral beam proﬁle can be used to evaluate the interference signal. Because the pulses interfere at small
skew angles, the phase between beams changes continuously along the intersection path in the focal volume. Consequently, the
interference contrast in these non-collinear geometries is typically much weaker than in Michelson-type interferometers.

In this contribution we demonstrate FT spectroscopy in the XUV spectral range by employing a recently developed
Michelson-type all-reﬂective split-and-delay autocorrelator design23. The instrument is based on two interleaved lamellar
mirrors, which generate two replicas of XUV pulses propagating collinearly. It enables quasi amplitude division, resolves
interferometric autocorrelation signals and can be applied in modern Ramsey-like experimental schemes24. It implies that the
device can be used to acquire phase information in some cases, for instance, if implemented in nonlinear detection schemes
that go beyond measuring ﬁeld-autocorrelation traces in spectroscopic applications. Of course, the latter are better off at
continuous or pseudo-continuous sources like synchrotrons14. The common-path laser interferometer allows for tight focusing
of phase-coherent pulse replicas while keeping the fringe contrast at maximum in the focal volume. This unique capability is
essential for nonlinear coherent spectroscopic applications and ultrashort pulse metrology.

2 Experimental Setup

The experiment utilizes a table-top high-harmonic source driven by Yb-ﬁber-laser technology and delivering short pulses
with high photon ﬂux in the XUV. Such sources can provide signiﬁcantly higher repetition rates than the currently operat-
ing free-electron lasers based on superconducting linear accelerators25 and offer very high temporal resolution due to the
intrinsically small timing jitter26. Here we use a high harmonic source, which is conceptually similar to the one presented
in27, but operating at a reduced repetition rate of 100 kHz. A 20 W average power Yb-ﬁber laser providing 250 fs pulses at
1030 nm is frequency doubled in a 1 mm thick BBO crystal. The resulting 200 fs, 515 nm pulses at 10 W average power are post
compressed to sub-20 fs using a nonlinear hollow-core ﬁber with a subsequent chirped-mirror compressor. High-harmonic
generation (HHG) is driven by focusing these pulses to a spot size of 90 µm into an Ar gas jet resulting in a generated photon
ﬂux of ≈ 2 · 1015 photons/s in the 11th harmonic (H11) at 26.5 eV photon energy. Subsequently, separation of the driving laser
and the generated XUV radiation is achieved using two grazing-incidence plates28, with an XUV reﬂectivity of 55% each, and
additional 200 nm thick aluminum ﬁlters with a measured XUV transmission of 20%29. Spatial and spectral characterization
of the generated XUV radiation is performed by using the 90◦-reﬂection of a removable 1 µm aluminum foil by means of a
ﬂat-ﬁeld grating spectrometer equipped with a CCD camera.

focused by a toroidal mirror onto a Ce:YAG scintillator. (b) In the focal plane at the Ce:YAG scintillator the diffraction orders
of the lamellae can be resolved. Integrating the signal from the region-of-interest (red box, ROI) encompassing the 0th
diffraction order as a function of relative phase delay yields the ﬁeld-autocorrelation trace of the light source. (c) The Fourier
transform of the sketched interferogram provides the spectrum of the XUV source.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic overview of the optical beam passing the FT instrument. The key element is the split-and-delay
unit (SDU). It consists of two interleaved lamellar mirrors splitting the wavefront of the incoming XUV pulse uniformly across
the beam proﬁle. The design was suggested by Strong and Vanasse in the late 50’s to overcome the absence of beam splitters in
the far-infrared spectral range30. In the 90’s Möller proposed to extend the principle of lamellar mirrors to the high energy
range31. The special mirror assembly in the present realization is cut from a silicon wafer and is coated with a 30 nm thick
nickel layer. Its period is d = 250 µm. The mechanical stability of the SDU is essential for interferometry at short wavelengths.
In order to measure a high-quality interferogram of H11 at λ = 46.8 nm the relative position of the reﬂective elements should be
known to a precision better than ≈ 10 nm, i.e. ≈ λ /4. This is on the order of the background vibration in the laboratory, which
is typically monitored during the measurements. The position of the reﬂective lamellar surface in the movable interferometer
arm is controlled by 3-axes piezo-driven motors with nanometer precision. Building on previous demonstrations32, 33, the setup
is advanced byintegrating three commercial laser interferometers (SmarAct) enabling position measurement of the lamellar
optics at repetition rates up to 40 kHz for online feedback control and ofﬂine FT data tagging. These reﬁnements improve
the precision of the relative lamellar-mirror displacement by 1-2 orders of magnitude, thereby improving the contrast in the
recorded interferograms. This precision and stability is crucial for FT spectroscopy in the XUV spectral range. The XUV light
is reﬂected from the autocorrelator mirrors at the grazing-incidence angle of α = 8◦. The SDU provides collinear propagation
of the two coherent pulse replicas with variable delay controlled by translating the movable lamellar mirror with nanometer and
attosecond precision, respectively. Note that the optical path difference (OPD) is given by

s = 2 · ∆z · sin α,

(1)

with ∆z being the mirror displacement. For instance, a displacement of ∆z = 1 nm corresponds to about s = 280 pm, which
results in a time delay between the copies of XUV pulses of only ∆t = 0.93 as.

Upon reﬂection from the lamellar-mirror assembly, the XUV beam is focused onto a Ce:YAG scintillator by a toroidal mirror
with a focal length of f = 5.3 m. The wavefronts of each partial beam are parallel in each diffraction order. Thus, the temporal
interference generated in the far-ﬁeld depends only on the longitudinal displacement of the lamellar mirrors. The diffraction
maxima are separated by ∆r = λ f/d, where λ is the central wavelength, d is the lamellar period and f is the focal length32.
The maximum intensity continuously slips between even and odd diffraction orders as we scan the relative phase (time) delay

3/10

between the two beams. At delay τ = 0 the maximum intensity is reached in 0th order, whereas for τ = π the odd diffraction
orders are enhanced with maximum contrast due to the collinear beam propagation in the common-path interferometer33. It
allows for tight focusing of phase-coherent pulse replicas, while keeping the fringe contrast at maximum in the focal point. This
unique capability is essential for nonlinear coherent spectroscopic applications striving to unravel ultrafast quantum phenomena
in matter by detecting electrons and ions generated in the focal volume. For cameras and similar detectors this is not strictly
true however, since it is in principle possible to select a small partial fraction of the fringe system. In the present experiment,
the ﬂuorescence signal from the scintillator is recorded by a CMOS camera. In order to obtain the ﬁeld-autocorrelation
(AC) trace of the light source, we integrate the signal intensity in the region-of-interest (ROI) encompassing the 0th-order
diffraction maximum. Note that the 0th-order maximum consist of all frequencies selected by a plane multi-layer mirror,
which was designed for a photon energy of 26.6 eV and installed behind the lamellar-mirror assembly in front of the vacuum
chamber hosting the detectors. In data processing, we account for laser intensity ﬂuctuations by normalizing the AC signal
to the overall signal intensity recorded by the CMOS detector. Additionally, we apply a centroiding algorithm correcting the
position of the image center in the far-ﬁeld. This allows for correction of small beam-pointing ﬂuctuations remaining from the
beam-stabilization system of the optical driving laser. The statistical analysis of the recorded scintillator images gives a spatial
jitter in the XUV focal plane of ∆x = 15 µm horizontally and ∆y = 60 µm (FWHM) vertically, i.e. in dispersion direction (see
the inset in Fig. 2). This is approximately a factor of 3 smaller than the beam waist at focus assuming diffraction-limited optics
and Gaussian XUV beams. Beam-pointing instabilities on this order of magnitude are usually insigniﬁcant for applications
using electron and ion spectrometers. The ﬁeld autocorrelation AF(τ) is deﬁned by

where EXUV (t) represents the complex electric ﬁeld of the XUV pulse and τ is the delay between two laser pulses. Note that
the ﬁrst term refers to the pulse energy and the second is the ﬁeld AC. Thus, Eq.( 2) is the foundation of Fourier-transform
spectroscopy. Measuring the interferogram AF(τ) is equivalent to measuring the ﬁltered spectrum of the harmonic source.
The recorded signal is periodically modulated as a function of time delays and its Fourier transform yields the spectrum.
We emphasize that the temporal proﬁle (chirp) of the XUV pulse cannot be determined from AF(τ). However, the spectral
bandwidth provides the transform-limited pulse duration and vice versa. For a drive pulse with a sufﬁciently small chirp, the
interferogram can visualize the number of attosecond bursts in one attosecond pulse train emitted during the HHG process as
described in22.

The sampling energy width of the Fourier-transform spectrometer depends solely on the OPD between the two XUV pulse

replicas

∆E ∝ 1/L,

(3)

where L is the maximum optical path difference that can be set in the autocorrelator. In our instrument the corresponding
maximum useful mirror displacement of ∆z = 1 mm at a grazing-incidence angle of α = 8◦ results in L = 278 µm, which gives
a maximum sampling energy width of ∆E = 4.5 meV. We note that for the device depicted in Fig. 1 the given resolution is
limited intrinsically by the transient loss of the transverse overlap between the two beams reﬂected from the lamellar-mirror
assembly for larger delays, i.e. the increasing mirror displacement resulting in parallel beam separation.

Due to the linearity of the Fourier transformation, the absolute calibration of the instrument requires only one reference
spectral line. However, if this anchor point is not available, precise calibration of the delay time axis, i.e. the optical path
difference in both interferometer arms, is still possible. It mainly requires exact knowledge of the grazing-incidence angle
of the photon beam impinging on the lamellar-mirror assembly. Under these experimental conditions, an error of ∆α = 0.1◦
would result in a relative energy mismatch of about 1.2 %, which is on the order of 300 meV for 26 eV photon energy. Note that
this relative error is uniform and constant overall photon energies. In contrast, grating spectrometers separate wavelengths
according to their characteristic diffraction angles. Thus, its absolute calibration requires series of well-known emission lines
distributed over a broad spectral range e.g. equally spaced harmonics from an HHG process. Although the calibration of
FT seems to be straightforward, we note in passing that it requires a well-collimated beam to start with. In our experiment
we use a single toroidal mirror as a collimator. It is known that a toroid produces coma aberration, which we resolve in the

50 ms (5000 laser shots) per time step. A typical scintillator camera image of the diffraction orders is shown in the bottom right.
The interferogram is derived by integrating the ROI (red square) and normalizing it to the intensity recorded by the entire
CMOS detector. For sake of clarity we plot the difference between this signal and the average over the full delay scan. The
Gaussian envelope ﬁtted to the data gives a width ∆τ = 8 fs (FWHM) corresponding to a transform-limited pulse length of
σXUV = 5.7 fs. The magniﬁcations show the ﬁeld oscillations of the dominant 11th harmonic with a time period of

far-ﬁeld image of the focal spot (Fig. 2). Obviously, any kind of aberration in the far-ﬁeld reduces the interference contrast in
the measurement and a complex optical system for its compensation could be applied. For instance, studies using three toroidal
mirrors controlled by a genetic algorithm achieved coma-free micrometer-size focal spots34. However, it is the strength of the
current common-path interferometer that these aberrations do not play a role here. As we will see in the following, as long as
individual diffraction orders can be resolved in the far-ﬁeld image the quality of the interferograms is extremely good.

3 Results

The ﬁeld AC trace of the HHG source is shown in Fig. 2. It reveals periodic, sine-like modulations multiplied with a Gaussian
envelope. The interferogram is obtained by integrating the intensity of the 0th-order interference maximum and plotting the
corresponding signal as a function of time delay between the two XUV pulses. A typical image recorded by the camera
shows the 0th and 1st diffraction orders as displayed in the inset (on the bottom right). We ﬁt a Gaussian envelope to the AC
signal and obtain the autocorrelation width of ∆τ = 8 fs (FWHM). Thus, the transform-limited XUV pulse length derived from
the measurement is σXUV = ∆τ/
2 = 5.67 fs. Note that this is in excellent agreement with simulations of the HHG phase
matching window35 and the single-atom response36, resulting in an XUV pulse duration of < 6 fs27.

Figure 3. The XUV spectrum of the HHG source obtained by the Fourier transform of the AC signal (blue). The spectrum
reveals a dominant contribution from H11 at 26.6 eV and two satellite peaks from H9 (21.8 eV) and H13 (31.4 eV). The
amplitude of satellites is strongly suppressed by the reﬂectance of the multi-layer mirror (red), which is designed for H11.

In order to demonstrate the stability of the experimental setup we recorded interferograms with a sampling step size of
∆t = 7.1 as. The clear oscillation shown in the zoom on the top right and bottom left in the Fig. 2 demonstrate the precise
control of the relative phase of the harmonic pulses on the single-digit attosecond time scale. The ﬁeld oscillation has a period
T11th = 148 as. In addition, a superimposed beating pattern is visible in the interferogram with a longer period of T = 860 as.
It results from the neighboring harmonic orders H9 and H13, which pass the multi-layer mirror (ML) to some extent. It is
worthwhile to note that this period matches the temporal separation of the individual bursts of attosecond laser pulses emitted at
each optical half cycle of the driving laser pulse, whose visibility is suppressed due to the spectral ﬁltering caused by the ML.
At 515 nm drive wavelength, this corresponds to the observed time period of 860 as.

The Fourier transform of the recorded interferogram is displayed in Fig. 3. As expected, the spectrum shows a dominant
peak at 26.6 eV (H11) with adjacent two weak satellite peaks at 21.8 eV (H9) and 31.4 eV (H13), respectively. This is in good
agreement with the reﬂectivity curve of the multi-layer mirror, which was optimized for a photon energy of 26.6 eV selecting
H11 and strongly suppressing the other frequencies from the harmonic comb.

To exploit the capacity of the FT instrument we spectrally narrow the 11th harmonic by ﬁlling an approximately 1 m long
part of the vacuum chamber with Ar to increase its partial pressure, i.e. atom density. The presence of the Fano resonance in the
photoabsorption continuum of Ar around 26.6 eV modiﬁes the transmitted spectrum due to the spectrally narrow decrease of
the absorption cross-section37. We have selected this transition for our benchmark experiment, because the underlying spectral
tailoring has been carefully analyzed previously by means of high-resolution grating-based spectroscopy38. In Fig. 4 the results
obtained from the FT measurements are compared with the spectrum recorded with the grating-based XUV spectrometer at
two different conditions. The total absorption cross-section of Ar is plotted as a gray-dashed line. At a base pressure of (a)
p = 1 · 10−5 mbar, i.e. negligible absorption due to the residual gas, the H11 energy bandwidth is ∆E = 430 meV (FWHM).
Its width is due to the short pulse duration (broad spectrum) of the 515 nm driving laser. Subsequently, we tailor the H11
transmission through the setup by utilizing the window-like Fano resonance. Therefore, we increase the Ar gas ﬂow up to
a backing pressure of (b) pAr = 8 · 10−2 mbar. Under this condition both spectrometer types resolve the asymmetric Fano
proﬁle with ∆E = 50 meV (FWHM). The results are in very good agreement with the reported line width of Γ = 76 meV for the
3s3p64p1P1 Fano resonance measured at a synchrotron39. Notably, the FT energy resolution is solely limited by the accessible
delay range generated by the SDU as deﬁned in Eq.( 3). As described in section 2, the speciﬁcations of the FT instrument
give an energy sampling width of ∆E = 4.5 meV. This allows to achieve a resolution of about ∆E ≈ 13 meV with three
sampling points per spectral line at 26.6 eV, which corresponds to E/∆E = 2000. Thus, the FT instrument offers comparable
resolution as state-of-the-art high-resolution grating-based XUV spectrometers. The latter used in our experiment provides
∆E = 20 meV29 and its performance is in addition limited by the slit size, which compromises the signal strength on the detector.

An important parameter in Fourier-transform spectroscopy is the signal-to-noise ratio in the measured AC signal. To

minimum in the absorption is due to the 3s3p64p1P1 Fano resonance, which locally modiﬁes the total cross-section39.

where k is a constant of the order of unity, which depends on the line shape. The value of NW gives the number of statistically
independent points in a ﬁtted line width W (FWHM) and S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio40. For the unperturbed H11 emission
with S/N = 40, NW = 7 and W = 430 meV the accuracy is about 4 meV. For the sharp Fano resonance the accuracy is about
0.7 meV. Obviously, this effect is signiﬁcantly smaller than the current resolution limit set by the maximum beam path
difference of one interferometer arm with respect to the other.

4 Summary

In this contribution we present benchmark experiments applying a compact common-path interferometer for Fourier-transform
spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The key component of the device is a broad-bandwidth Michelson-type
all-reﬂective split-and-delay unit. It allows to record ﬁeld-autocorrelation traces at XUV wavelengths as a function of time
delay between two coherent pulse replicas with single-digit attosecond resolution, while scanning delays up to 1 ps. The
capacity of the technique is demonstrated by characterizing the 11th harmonic emission line of an ultrafast 515 nm driving
laser. As we tailor the unperturbed 430 meV wide spectrum at 26.6 eV by the window-like 3s3p64p1P1 Fano resonance in
Ar atoms we can clearly resolve the asymmetric lineshape with a natural width of ∆E = 50 meV (FWHM) by sampling the
data with an energy sampling width of 4.5 meV. We benchmark the results by comparing the data with experiments using a
state-of-the-art grating-based high-resolution XUV spectrometer with a resolution of 20 meV and reach very good agreement.
The power of interferometry for attosecond science becomes obvious when looking at the high-harmonic generation process in
time domain. The recorded ﬁeld-autocorrelation trace of the XUV light wave oscillation with a dominant time period of 148 as
shows ﬁngerprints of attosecond bursts emitted every half cycle of the optical drive pulse, i.e. every 860 as.

5 Outlook

A future challenge for applications requiring simultaneously high laser power density at focus position and a spectral resolution
exceeding a few times 103 is to increase the effective surface of the lamellar-mirror assembly. This would support expanding
the beam proﬁle (larger numerical aperture) reﬂected from its surface and increasing the OPD without losing the spatial
overlap and interference contrast, respectively. It calls for advanced engineering and materials design, because manufacturing

7/10

lamellar mirrors with larger area without distortion of the substrate on a level of 10 nm or less is demanding. Spatial distortions
introduce phase errors in the reﬂected wavefronts, which reduce the interference contrast. Obviously, this is of great relevance
for applications in the soft X-ray spectral range where the limits are truly on the single-digit nm scale. Therefore, we have
started to develop special manufacturing protocols and nickel-coating procedures of the micro-machined silicon substrates
for producing the next generation of lamellar-mirror assemblies for broadband soft x-ray applications. Recently, we have
performed pioneering soft x-ray autocorrelation experiments, where we managed to control the relative phase of pulse replicas
at 4.5 nm central wavelength on the corresponding few-attosecond timescale41. We could show that soft x-ray interferometry is
a powerful tool to probe ultrafast correlated quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of Auger shake-up states with sub-cycle
precision. Even without recording a complete autocorrelation trace and just measuring a few optical cycles we discovered that
speciﬁc non-radiative Auger-decay channels show a relative time (phase) delay of only 3 as with respect to the driving light
wave oscillation. This is among the fastest electronic processes ever measured demonstrating the power of phase-sensitive
detection of interaction products using coherent soft x-ray pulse pairs.

Thus we can conclude that the performance of our interferometric autocorrelator at the heart of the FT spectrometer opens
up a new window of opportunities for soft X-ray pulse metrology, dynamic studies and nonlinear coherent spectroscopy in
matter, materials and in the life sciences. The development of table-top setups based on coherent femtosecond and attosecond
sources is fundamental in this challenging ﬁeld, as the access to free-electron lasers or other large-scale facilities is limited for
obvious reasons. This is especially true considering the recent progress offered by high-harmonic generation sources pushing
spectroscopic studies in time and frequency domain to the ultimate limit given by the uncertainty principle connecting temporal
and energy resolution. Of particular interest is the so-called water window, which refers to the spectral range between the
K-absorption edge of oxygen at a wavelength of 2.34 nm and the K-absorption edge of carbon at 4.4 nm corresponding to
photon energies of 530 and 280 eV, respectively. Water is transparent to these soft x-rays, while carbon, nitrogen and other
elements found in biomolecules are absorbing, which may allow to unravel biological functions with element-speciﬁcity in
natural environment.
