Abstract: The detection of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by the COHERENT
collaboration has set on quantitative grounds the existence of an irreducible neutrino back-
ground in direct detection searches of Weakly Interacting Massive Dark Matter candidates.
This background leads to an ultimate discovery limit for these experiments: a minimum
Dark Matter interaction cross section below which events produced by the coherent neu-
trino scattering will mimic the Dark Matter signal, the so-called neutrino ﬂoor.
In this
work we study the modiﬁcation of such neutrino ﬂoor induced by non-standard neutrino
interactions within their presently allowed values by the global analysis of oscillation and
COHERENT data. By using the full likelihood information of such global analysis we
consistently account for the correlated eﬀects of non-standard neutrino interactions both
in the neutrino propagation in matter and in its interaction in the detector. We quantify
their impact on the neutrino ﬂoor for ﬁve future experiments: DARWIN (Xe), ARGO (Ar),
Super-CDMS HV (Ge and Si) and CRESST phase III (CaWO4). Quantitatively, we ﬁnd
that non-standard neutrino interactions allowed at the 3σ level can result in an increase
of the neutrino ﬂoor of up to a factor ∼ 5 with respect to the Standard Model expecta-
tions and impact the expected sensitivities of the ARGO, CRESST phase III and DARWIN
experiments.

The existence of Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe is considered one of the pillars of physics
Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). However, almost a century since it was suggested we
remain ignorant of what it is made of. Nature has not been kind enough so far to provide
us with an unambiguous way to probe its character by means of its interaction with a
human made detector. This is so despite the continuous eﬀorts of scientiﬁc and engineering
ingenuity which has resulted into experiments which are sensitive to weaker and weaker DM
interactions and to a larger range of the DM candidate masses, in particular, for the well
motivated DM models consisting of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) [1].

Neutrinos, on the other hand, have given us the ﬁrst direct evidence of BSM physics in
the form of ﬂavor transitions which were ﬁrst observed in natural neutrino ﬂuxes produced in
the Sun and in the Earth atmosphere and have now been conﬁrmed and precisely measured
in a variety of oscillation experiments [2]. As usual in particle physics the signals of today are
the backgrounds of tomorrow, and the possibility of the coherent scattering of these natural
neutrinos with nucleus (CνNS) [3] of the target material giving a nuclear recoil, similar to
what is expected of a DM particle, will eventually constitute an irreducible background for
the WIMP discovery [4] in the next generation of DM direct detection experiments [5–11].
These experiments are expected to have sensitivity to signiﬁcantly lower WIMP-nucleon
cross sections thanks to a lower recoil energy threshold and/or a larger target mass. This,
in turn, will place these detectors closer to reach such discovery limit also known as the
neutrino ﬂoor. Thus, the ﬁrst observation of CνNS by the COHERENT collaboration [12]
with rates consistent with the SM expectation bears important implications for them.

In this paper we want to quantify what is the range of variation of the neutrino ﬂoor
for such next generation experiments which is still allowed by the present experimental
constraints on the relevant neutrino interactions. One can phenomenologically study generic
contributions that aﬀect CνNS, and therefore can modify the neutrino ﬂoor, by considering
a model-independent approach where ﬂavor dependent four-fermion eﬀective operators of

– 1 –

neutrinos and quarks are allowed. These operators will induce neutral current (NC) non-
standard neutrino interactions (NSI) with the target nucleus at the detector, and also
modify in a non-trivial manner the matter potential relevant to the ﬂavor evolution of the
solar and atmospheric neutrinos. For this reason not only COHERENT scattering data but
also results from oscillation experiments are relevant in the determination of their allowed
values.

There are several studies in the literature of how the expected rate of neutrino back-
ground in direct DM detection experiments could be altered by non-standard ﬂavor-inde-
pendent contributions [13, 14] as well as ﬂavor-dependent NSI’s [15, 16]. Here we extend
those works with a detailed and statistically consistent evaluation of the impact of NSI’s on
the neutrino ﬂoor at a variety of next generation DM detection experiments. To do so we
make use of the full likelihood information of the global analysis of oscillation and COHER-
ENT data to consistently account for the correlated eﬀects of the NSI’s both for neutrino
propagation in matter and in its interaction in the detector. In particular, we quantify their
impact on the neutrino ﬂoor for ﬁve future experiments: four with monoatomic detector
targets (Xe used by DARWIN, Ar by ARGO, Ge and Si by Super-CDMS HV) and one
operating with a molecular target (CaWO4 for CRESST phase III).

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduce the relevant NC-NSI La-
grangian and summarize the results on the constraints on the NC-NSI coeﬃcients from
the global analysis of neutrino oscillation and COHERENT scattering data. In Sec. 3, we
use the full likelihood of such global analysis to quantify the allowed modiﬁcation to the
diﬀerential recoil rate of neutrino events at direct detection experiments by the presence of
these NC-NSI. After describing brieﬂy the full statistical analysis used to obtain the DM
discovery limit, in Sec. 4 we present our results in terms of the range of variation of the
neutrino ﬂoor induced by the NC-NSI interactions at the aforesaid future detectors using
diﬀerent target materials. Finally, in Sec. 5 we draw our ﬁnal conclusions.

2 NC-NSI Lagrangian and constraints

In this work we consider NC-NSI aﬀecting neutral-current processes relevant to neutrino co-
herent scattering in DM experiments. Generically NC-NSI interactions can be parametrized
in the form:

LNSI = −2

(cid:15)f,P

where GF is the Fermi constant, α, β are ﬂavor indices, P ≡ PL, PR and f is a Standard
Model (SM) charged fermion. In this notation, (cid:15)f,P
αβ parametrizes the strength of the new
interaction with respect to the Fermi constant, (cid:15)f,P
αβ ∼ O(GX /GF ).

First we notice that if all possible operators in Eq. (2.1) are added to the SM La-
grangian, the Hamiltonian of the system which governs neutrino oscillations in presence of

where Uvac is the 3-lepton mixing matrix in vacuum [17–19] and Ne(x) is the electron number
density as a function of the distance traveled by the neutrino in matter. For antineutrinos
H ¯ν = (Hvac −Hmat)∗. In Eq. (2.2) the generalized matter potential depends on the eﬀective
NC-NSI parameters, (cid:15)αβ, deﬁned as

(cid:88)

(cid:15)αβ =

Yf (x) (cid:15)f,V
αβ .

f =u,d,e

(2.3)

Note that the sum only extends to those fermions present in the background medium (up
quarks, down quarks and electrons), and Yf (x) = Nf (x)/Ne(x) is the average ratio of the
number density of the fermion f to the number density of electrons along the neutrino
propagation path. In the Earth, the ratios Yf are constant to very good approximation,
while for solar neutrinos they depend on the distance to the center of the Sun. The presence
of NC-NSI with electrons, f = e, would aﬀect not only neutrino propagation in matter, as
described in Eq. (2.2), but also the neutrino-electron cross section in experiments such as
SK, Borexino and reactor experiments; hence, for the sake of simplicity, in what follows we
consider only NC-NSI with either up quarks (f = u) or for down quarks (f = d). Also, it
should be noted that only the vector-like NC-NSI combination ((cid:15)V = (cid:15)L + (cid:15)R) contribute
to the matter potential in neutrino oscillations. Those are precisely the relevant couplings
for CνNS in the approximation ER (cid:28) Eν, where ER is the nuclear recoil energy and Eν
the incoming neutrino energy.

In general, the matter potential in Eq. (2.2) contains a total of 9 additional parameters
per f : 3 diagonal real parameters and 3 oﬀ-diagonal complex parameters (i.e., 3 additional
moduli and 3 complex phases). However, the evolution of the system given by the Hamil-
tonian in Eq. (2.2) is invariant up to a constant, so that oscillation experiments are only
sensitive to the diﬀerences between the diagonal terms in the matter potential.

As a consequence of the CPT symmetry, neutrino evolution is invariant if the Hamilto-
nian in Eq. (2.2) is transformed as H ν → −(H ν)∗, see [20, 21] for a discussion in the context
of NC-NSI. This transformation can be realized by changing the oscillation parameters as

and simultaneously transforming the NC-NSI parameters as

((cid:15)τ τ − (cid:15)µµ) → −((cid:15)τ τ − (cid:15)µµ) ,

(2.5)

see Refs. [21–23] for details. In Eq. (2.4) δCP is the leptonic Dirac CP phase, and we are
using here the parametrization conventions from Ref. [23]. This degeneracy allows for a
change in the octant of θ12, which leads to the appearance of the so-called LMA-D solution
in the solar neutrino analysis [24], when combined with large diagonal NC-NSI coeﬃcients
(cid:15)ee − (cid:15)µµ ∼ −2, and it also implies an ambiguity in the neutrino mass ordering. Being an
intrinsic degeneracy of the full OSC+NSI Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation it cannot
be resolved by neutrino oscillation experiments alone.

The presence of the NC-NSI’s also aﬀects the inelastic interaction of neutrinos and
therefore neutrino scattering experiments are sensitive to some combinations of (cid:15)f,P
αβ , de-
pending on whether the scattering takes place with nuclei or electrons, the number of
protons and neutrons in the target nuclei, and other factors. Thus altogether current
experimental constraints on vector-like NC-NSI parameters include those obtained from
a global ﬁt to oscillation data [21] as well as those obtained from results from neutrino
scattering data. For oscillation constraints on NC-NSI parameters we refer to the com-
prehensive global ﬁt in the framework of 3ν oscillation plus NC-NSI with up and down
quarks performed in [21] which we brieﬂy summarize here for completeness. All oscillation
experiments except SNO are only sensitive to vector NC-NSI via matter eﬀects as described
above. There is some sensitivity of SNO to axial couplings in their NC data, so for the
sake of simplicity the analysis in Ref. [21] and all combinations that we will present in
what follows are made under the assumption of purely vector-like NC-NSI. The ﬁt includes
data sets from KamLAND reactor experiment [25] and solar neutrino data from Chlo-
rine [26], Gallex/GNO [27], SAGE [28], Super-Kamiokande [29–33] Borexino [34, 35] and
SNO [36–39], together with atmospheric neutrino results from Super-Kamiokande phases
1–4 [40], long-baseline results from MINOS [41, 42] and T2K [43], and reactor results from
CHOOZ [44], Palo Verde [45], Double CHOOZ [46], Daya Bay [47] and RENO [48], to-
gether with reactor short baseline ﬂux determination from Bugey [49, 50], ROVNO [51, 52],
Krasnoyarsk [53, 54], ILL [55], Gösgen [56], and SRP [57].

In principle, the analysis depends on the six 3ν oscillations parameters plus eight NC-
NSI parameters per f target. To keep the ﬁt manageable in Ref. [21] only real NC-NSI were
considered and ∆m2
21 eﬀects were neglected in the analysis of atmospheric and long-baseline
experiments. This renders the analysis independent of the CP phase in the leptonic mixing
matrix. Furthermore in Ref. [58] it was shown that strong cancellations in the oscillation
of atmospheric neutrinos occur when two eigenvalues of Hmat are equal, and it is for such
case that the weakest constraints are placed.

For what concerns bounds from non-oscillation experiments, generically NC-NSI pa-
rameters in gauge invariant models of new physics at high energies are expected to be
subject to tight constraints from charged lepton observables [59, 60] and also directly from
collider data (see for example [61]). For those constructions the bounds on the NC-NSI of
neutrinos are too strong to lead to any observable eﬀect in direct dark matter detection ex-
periments. However, more recently it has been argued that viable gauge models with light
mediators (i.e., below the electro-weak scale) may lead to observable eﬀects in oscillations
without entering in conﬂict with other bounds [62–64] (see also Ref. [65] for a discussion).
Furthermore, for very light mediators, bounds from high-energy neutrino scattering experi-

– 4 –

ments such as CHARM [66] and NuTeV [67] do not apply. Conversely, even for models with
such very light mediators bounds on the vector-like NC-NSI can be imposed by the direct
observation of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, i.e., the same reaction which would
give rise the neutrino ﬂoor in the DM direct detection experiments. The modiﬁcation to
the CνNS cross section is given by [68]

In this respect, the most relevant results are those from the COHERENT collaboration
which recently reported the observation of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering at 6.7σ [12]
with neutrinos produced from pion decay at rest on a 14.6 kg CsI[Na] detector target. The
observed interaction rate is in good agreement with the SM prediction and therefore can
be used to constrain NC-NSI.

In Ref. [70] the COHERENT results were combined with the neutrino oscillation con-
straints to produce model-independent bounds on vector-like NC-NSI parameters which
are relevant to the evaluation of the neutrino ﬂoor for DM detection. In particular, it was
shown that after the inclusion of the COHERENT data the global analysis excludes the
intrinsic degeneracy in the NSI+OSC Hamiltonian described above (i.e., the LMA-D solu-
tion) at 3.1σ (3.6σ) CL for NC-NSI with up (down) quarks. In addition, the combination
of oscillation and COHERENT allows to derive competitive constraints on all NC-NSI pa-
rameters. For illustration we show in Fig. 1 the results from that combined ﬁt by plotting

(cid:15)f,V
αβ , for f = u (upper panels) and f = d (lower panels) after marginalization over the
undisplayed oscillation and NC-NSI parameters in each panel.1 As seen in the ﬁgure the
combination of oscillation and COHERENT results is able to impose constraints on all the
relevant vector-like NC-NSI coeﬃcients even when they are varied simultaneously in the
analysis. In this respect, it is important to notice that, in order to consistently obtain the
allowed eﬀects on the neutrino ﬂoor at a given CL as presented in the following section, we
use the full multidimensional ∆χ2 dependence on the NC-NSI and oscillation parameters
so to correctly account for the correlations among their allowed ranges.

3 Neutrino rate at direct detection experiments

Let us start by evaluating the impact of NC-NSI on the diﬀerential recoil rate of solar and
atmospheric neutrinos at direct detection searches. In doing so one has to bear in mind
that, unlike for SM ν interactions [4] and for the simpliﬁed BSM models considered in
Ref. [14], NC-NSI are ﬂavor dependent and therefore in their presence one must take into
consideration the ﬂavor of the neutrino ﬂuxes arriving at the detector. This is incorporated
by introducing the neutrino transition probability between the source and the detector, so
the diﬀerential recoil rate takes the form:

For simplicity, we will only consider here the solar and atmospheric contributions to the
neutrino ﬂux. The Diﬀuse Supernova Neutrino background [72], expected but not yet
observed, could aﬀect the discovery limit for very large exposures [73, 74]. Other neutrino
ﬂuxes, such as geoneutrinos [4] and reactor antineutrinos [75], depend on the location of

important sites, thus making their contribution negligible for the facilities and exposures
analyzed here.

The ﬂavor transition probabilities for solar νe and atmospheric νe and νµ (and their

Solar neutrinos are electron neutrinos produced in the Sun core with energy up to
∼ 20 MeV. They are usually labeled as pp, pep, hep, 7Be, 8B, 13N, 15O, and 17F neutri-
nos depending on the reaction rate in which they are produced. In what follows we will
consider the ﬂuxes as predicted by the B16-GS98 Solar Model [76]. Its ﬂavor transition
probabilities can be obtained in very good approximation in the one mass dominance limit,
∆m2
31/Eν). In
this approximation the survival probability Pee can be written as [77, 78]

The matter chemical composition of the Sun varies substantially along the neutrino produc-
tion region, with Yn dropping from about 1/2 in the center to about 1/6 at the border of
the solar core. Consequently the evolution is diﬀerent when considering NC-NSI with up or
down quarks. Notice also that in the computation of the transition probabilities one must
account for the neutrino production point distribution in the Sun which is determined for
each neutrino component (pp, pep, hep, 7Be, 8B, 13N, 15O, and 17F) by the Solar Model.

Atmospheric neutrinos are electron and muon neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by
the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere and can extend to very large energies.
In what follows we consider the ﬂuxes obtained by the FLUKA collaboration [79]. Only
the low energy (sub-GeV) part of their spectrum can be relevant as background in DM
direct detection experiments [4]. Transition probabilities for these low energy neutrinos
present some unique features [80, 81] but generically Earth matter eﬀect are expected to
have limited impact in their evolution. Nevertheless, for the sake of consistency, we obtain
the ﬂavor transition probabilities for the atmospheric neutrinos by solving the 3ν evolution
equation (Eq. (3.3)) using the Earth matter density distribution described by the PREM
model [82]. Since direct detection experiments do not have directionality, one has to consider
neutrino trajectories arriving in the detector from any direction. Both the length of the
trajectory and the amount of Earth matter traversed will be diﬀerent for neutrinos arriving
from diﬀerent zenith angles, which makes their ﬂavor probability at the detector direction-
dependent. The transition probability included in the diﬀerential recoil rate, Eq. (3.1), is
then the angular average

In Fig. 2 we plot the diﬀerential recoil rate of solar and atmospheric neutrinos as a
function of the recoil energy for a monoatomic target (Xe, upper panels) and for a molecu-
lar one (CaWO4, lower panels). We only show the eﬀects of NC-NSI for f = u as the cases
for f = d are very similar. For illustration, we label in the ﬁgure the dominant component
of the neutrino ﬂux contributing at the diﬀerent targets for each recoil energy range. The
shown ranges are obtained by scanning the multidimensional space of NC-NSI and oscilla-
tion parameters allowed by the global analysis of oscillation+COHERENT data at 1σ, 2σ,
and 3σ (∆χ2
OSC+COH ≤ 1, 4, 9). For each point in the space of the allowed parameters
we compute the predicted rate consistently including the NC-NSI coeﬃcients both in the
oscillation probabilities and in the interaction cross section.

We notice ﬁrst that the prediction for best ﬁt parameters is oﬀ the SM expectation.
As mentioned in Sec. 2 this is driven by the 2σ tension between the determination of ∆m2
21
from KamLAND and solar neutrino experiments. From the ﬁgure we also see that the
allowed modiﬁcation at 1σ, 2σ and 3σ can result both in an increase or a reduction of the
expected rate. Quantitatively we ﬁnd that with NC-NSI’s allowed at 3σ by the oscilla-
tion+COHERENT data the neutrino background rate can vary from a factor ∼ 6-7 larger
to a factor ∼ 0.2 smaller than what is predicted by the SM interactions, the larger enhance-
ment happening for a CaWO4 detector. Moreover, as seen in the ﬁgure, the modiﬁcation
of the rate with respect to the SM prediction depends on which nuclear reaction dominates
the solar neutrino ﬂux at the given energy. This happens because of the NC-NSI in the
matter potential as well as the diﬀerent distributions of neutrino production points for the
various nuclear reactions, which implies that the modiﬁcation of the transition probabilities
depends on the neutrino energy. However, altogether this is a relatively small eﬀect. For
solar neutrinos, the inclusion of the NC-NSI in the matter potential leads to correction of
up to ∼ 1% (∼ 12%) in the rate of pp (8B) neutrinos, while for atmospheric neutrinos the

diﬀerence induced by including NC-NSI in the propagation is of order ∼ 1%. Finally, note
that the peak structure that comes up at ER ≈ 50 keV for CaWO4 is a form factor feature.
Atmospheric neutrinos are relevant for recoil energies above O(30 keV).

A WIMP direct detection experiment is based on a simple principle: if a WIMP interacts
with the quarks of a nucleus, it should be possible to detect such interaction by measuring
the nuclear recoil produced on a target material. The negative results obtained so far have
propelled several proposals for future experiments [5–10], which will have larger exposures
and will be sensitive to smaller WIMP masses. It is for such future experiments that the
solar and atmospheric neutrino background can represent a limitation to sensitivity.

Bounds on the WIMP mass-cross section parameter space accessible by a given ex-
periment can be calculated using various statistical methods. In this work we follow the
approach of Refs. [4, 73, 83? , 84] which makes use of the likelihood ratio test statistics
to calculate the so-called discovery limit, which is deﬁned as the minimum cross section for
a given WIMP mass, mχ, for which a 3σ discovery is possible in 90% of the hypothetical
experiments. In brief, we deﬁne a binned likelihood test statistics with nb = 50 bins in the
interval [Eth, 100 keV], where Eth is the energy threshold of the experiment:

where ρ0 = 0.3 GeV/c2/cm3 is the local DM density and µn = mnmχ/(mn + mχ) is the
reduced mass of the WIMP-nucleon system [69, 85]. Furthermore, we assume a Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution function for the WIMP velocity distribution in the Earth’s frame
of reference f (v), with the escape velocity vesc = 544 km/s, and the Earth’s velocity vlab =
232 km/s [69]. In Eqs. (4.2)– (4.3) ε(ER) is the detector eﬃciency function.

The terms L(φj

ν) in Eq. (4.1) correspond to prior factors included to parametrize the
theoretical uncertainties on the normalization of each neutrino ﬂux component. We take

– 10 –

them to be Gaussian distributed with uncertainties σj given by the B16-GS98 Solar Model
(6% for pp, 10% for pep, 30% hep, 6% for 7Be, 12% for 8B, 15% for 13N, 17% for 15O,
and 20% for 17F), and the atmospheric ﬂux calculations which we conservatively take to be
20% [86]. These neutrino ﬂux normalizations will be treated here as nuisance parameters,
while the energy spectrum of each component is assumed to be known.2 For the sake
of simplicity we do not include in our likelihood astrophysical uncertainties aﬀecting the
WIMP signal [74].

The test between the neutrino-only hypothesis, H0, and the neutrino+WIMP hypoth-

esis, H1, is performed by using the likelihood ratio for a ﬁxed WIMP mass

λ(0) =

L(σχn = 0, mχ; ˚φν)
L(ˆσχn, mχ; ˆφν)

,

(4.5)

where ˆφν and ˆσχn are the neutrino ﬂuxes and WIMP-nucleon cross section values which
maximize the likelihood L(ˆσχn, mχ; ˆφν) while ˚φν is obtained by maximizing the likeli-
hood function in the case of the null hypothesis, L(σχn = 0, mχ; ˚φν). The signiﬁcance
of the WIMP signal (or, equivalently, of the disagreement between H0 and H1) is Z =
(cid:112)−2 ln λ(0). We construct its probability distribution function, p(Z|H0), by MC simulat-
ing 2000 experiments, creating for each one a spectra for both WIMP and neutrinos and
computing their corresponding value of Z. To determine the discovery limit we need to ﬁnd
the smallest cross section for which 90% of the experiments have evidence larger than 3σ,
this is, the minimum value of ˆσχn for which

(cid:90) ∞

p(Z|H0) dZ = 0.90 .

(4.6)

Clearly for an experiment with a given target, exposure and threshold the presence
of NC-NSI will aﬀect the discovery limit as it modiﬁes the background neutrino event
rate. To illustrate the maximal possible size of the modiﬁcation for a wide range of WIMP
masses we start by considering an idealized experiment with an extremely low threshold
(Eth = 0.01 eV), a large exposure (103 ton-year) and a 100% eﬃciency (ε(ER) = 1). We
plot the results in Fig. 3 for the same two targets considered in Fig. 2, i.e., a monoatomic
target of Xe and a composed target made of calcium tungstate (CaWO4). For the sake of
concreteness we consider NC-NSI with f = u quarks but similar results hold for NC-NSI
with f = d.

As seen in Fig. 3 the discovery limit curves exhibit the well known peaks [4, 73, 84?
] corresponding to the region in the parameter space which is signiﬁcantly mimicked by
the neutrino ﬂux component as labeled. For instance, the peak near a WIMP mass of
6 GeV is related to the background created by 8B solar neutrinos. Again, the shown
ranges are obtained by scanning the multidimensional space of NC-NSI and oscillation
parameters allowed by the global analysis of oscillation+COHERENT data at 1σ, 2σ and
3σ (∆χ2
OSC+COH ≤ 1, 4, 9). For each point in the allowed parameter space we compute

2This is a very good assumption for solar neutrinos as their energy dependence is determined by well-
known phase space factors. For low energy atmospheric neutrinos the energy dependence uncertainty is
also much smaller than the overall 20% normalization considered here.

ized detector with a Xe target (left) and a calcium tungstate (CaWO4) target (right), a threshold of
Eth = 0.01 eV, a 103 ton-year exposure, and 100% eﬃciency (ε(ER) = 1). For illustration, we mark
with vertical dashed lines the solar neutrino ﬂux components dominating the background for some
values of mχ at each target; for the CaWO4, the color indicates the contribution of the diﬀerent
elements. The red dashed lines corresponds to SM predictions while the blue full lines to the best
ﬁt values of the parameters of the global analysis of oscillation+COHERENT data. The shaded

the predicted neutrino background rates in each bin, consistently including the NC-NSI
coeﬃcients both in the oscillation probabilities and in the interaction cross section. With
such rates we obtain the corresponding discovery limit. As expected the inclusion of NC-
NSI does not change the position of the peaks since they do not modify the Eν dependence
of the CνNS cross section. Also, as mentioned in the previous section the neutrino ﬂoor
predicted at the best ﬁt point does not exactly coincide with the SM prediction because of
the preference of oscillation data for a small but non-zero NC-NSI coeﬃcients, which helps
reducing the tension between solar and KamLAND data in the determination of ∆m2
21. As
seen in the ﬁgure NSI-NC can lead to an enhancement or a suppression of the discovery
limit. Quantitatively we ﬁnd that within the 3σ allowed region the neutrino ﬂoor can be
modiﬁed between a factor ∼ 3 (13N neutrinos) to ∼ 5 (hep neutrinos) with respect to the
expectation from the SM. Finally, comparing the two panels in Fig. 3 we see that the main
diﬀerence between the two targets appears in the region of WIMP masses around ∼ 10
GeV, and is a consequence of the diﬀerent recoil energy behavior of the neutrino event
rates obtained when overlapping the contribution from the diﬀerent nuclear masses in the
composite target.

We now turn to estimate the possible impact of NC-NSI on the predicted sensitivity of
some proposed experiments. We will consider here four facilities: three with monoatomic

detector targets (DARWIN, ARGO and Super-CDMS HV) and one using a molecular tar-
get (CRESST phase III). Their targets, energy thresholds and exposures can be found in
Table 1. The results are shown in Fig. 4 where we plot our estimate of the range of varia-
tion of the neutrino ﬂoor induced by NC-NSI superimposed to the attainable bounds on the
WIMP-nucleon spin independent cross section as reported by each of the experiments. It is
important to stress that this ﬁgure cannot be used to make a ﬁnal quantitative statement as
the shown regions are calculated under diﬀerent assumptions. On the one hand we compute
the ultimate neutrino ﬂoor, i.e., considering only the neutrino irreducible background and
for an experiment 100% eﬃcient above its threshold. On the other hand the attainable
bounds quoted by the experiments assume 30% (DARWIN), 90% (ARGO), 85% (Super-
CDMS HV) and 70% (CRESST phase III) eﬃciency above their energy threshold. The
curves also do not always correspond to the same CL. Nevertheless, the comparison can be
used to foresee which experiments could potentially suﬀer a reduction of their sensitivity
reach because of the presence of NC-NSI.

As can be seen from this ﬁgure, for DARWIN [7] (top-left panel) the SM discovery
limit is below the expected sensitivity, however after the inclusion of presently allowed NC-
NSI the neutrino ﬂoor can rise above the experimental sensitivity for light WIMP masses
mχ (cid:46) 20 GeV. This is also the case for the ARGO [9] (middle-left panel) and CRESST
phase III [6] (bottom panel) experiments for which we ﬁnd that NC-NSI can increase the
neutrino ﬂoor above the expected sensitivity reach for WIMP masses mχ (cid:38) 50 GeV and
mχ ∼ 4 − 10 GeV, respectively. Thus if these experiments detect a signal compatible
with a WIMP around those mass ranges, it could be also interpreted as a neutrino event
produced by ﬂavor-dependent NC-NSI. Conversely the results show that these experiments
have the potential to place meaningful bounds on NC-NSI. Note, however, that in all the
cases presented here the ﬂoor has been somehow underestimated as a lower (more realistic)
eﬃciency would move the discovery limits up, hence closer to the experimental reach.

5 Conclusions

Next generation direct detection DM experiments are expected to substantially increase
the sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections for a wide range of DM masses. This will
place them closer to the region where solar and atmospheric neutrinos undergoing CνNS
will become an irreducible background.

tering rates that seem to be in agreement with the SM predictions, BSM contributions of
NC-NSI with the target nucleus, at a level that could impact future DM detectors, cannot
be excluded. This is true even if neutrino oscillation constraints are taken into account.

We investigated in this work to what extent the future experimental discovery limits of
DM direct detection facilities could be compromised by this ﬂavor-dependent BSM. We used
the full likelihood information of the global analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments and
COHERENT scattering data to consistently account for the correlated eﬀects of NC-NSI
in the neutrino propagation in matter as well as in its interaction with the detector.

To be speciﬁc, we estimated the maximum eﬀect which these still allowed BSM inter-
actions could have in experiments with diﬀerent targets (Xe in DARWIN, Ar in ARGO, Ge
and Si in Super-CDMS HV, and CaWO4 in CRESST phase III). We showed that the neu-
trino background contribution can be up to about ﬁve times larger than what is expected
by the SM, certainly having impact on the ultimate reach of the ARGO, CRESST phase III
and DARWIN experiments. In turn, these experiments may be able to constraint NC-NSI
to yet lower levels than currently allowed by data.
