Abstract 

Importance: 

There are reports that a sex disparity exists in outcomes in patients with COVID-

19, with men having more severe cases and higher mortality than women. 

Objective: 

To conduct a meta-analysis of current studies that examined sex differences in 

severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify potential mechanisms 

underpinning these differences.   

Methods:   

We performed a systematic review to collate data from observational studies 

examining associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. 

PubMed, Web of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. 

Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary 

data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), 

single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation 

sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms 

underlying the observed association. 

Results:   

39 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 

(53.3%) were males. Men were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe 

cases compared with women (OR = 1.63; 95% Cl = 1.28-2.06). Furthermore, the 

pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group compared with the female group 

indicated significant higher mortality rate for male (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.51-1.93). 

Subgroup analyses suggested that in patients with average age > 50 yr, the male had 

significantly higher severity rate than female (OR = 1.94; 95% Cl = 1.16-3.26). 

However, in patients with average age < 50 yr, the male group only exhibited a 

marginally increased severity rate compared with the female group (OR = 1.45; 95% 

Cl = 1.07-1.96). Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of 

ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based 

immunological differences exist, with cytokines associated with cytokine release 

syndrome preferentially expressed in men, and those associated with defense and 

recovery from viral infection preferentially expressed in women. ScRNA-seq data of 

the prostate and testis revealed that these two organs might be potential targets for 

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male population. The expression of androgen receptor 

(AR) is positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly 

regulate the expression of ACE2.   

Conclusions:   

This meta-analysis detected an increased severity and mortality rate in the male 

populations with COVID-19, which might be attributable to the sex-based differences 

in cellular compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host 

cell receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified as 

a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in men.

Introduction 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ascribed to the severe acute respiratory 

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an emerging outbreak globally since 

December 2019. The management of COVID-19 has become a current emergency 

public health event, which has attracted increasing attention. Early recognition, testing 

and isolation are the effective response to curb transmissions.1,2 Health security 

capacities improving, global collaboration in relation to COVID-19 and current travel 

restrictions are necessary for global epidemic control.3,4 Around 6.4-24.9% of patients 

infected with SARS-CoV-2 may progress to severe and even fatal acute respiratory 

distress syndrome (ARDS), 5-26.1% of patients need treatment in the intensive care 

unit (ICU), and the fatality rate of patients can reach 1.4-7.2%.5-8 Older age, higher 

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, chronic comorbidities were the 

risk factors associated with the patients of the 2019-nCoV infection9,10. However, 

whether the sex difference is related to the risk factors for infection, severity, and 

mortality of COVID-19 is still lacking a comprehensive analysis based on the 

integration of new studies.11 

Although some cases report support for sex differences to be associated with the 

onset and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia,12 some studies do not support this 

observation. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports on 44672 

confirmed cases showing that sex differences may be a risk factor for mortality, but 

there is no sex differences in morbidity.7 Even more confirmed cases of female than 

male in South Korea are reported by the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases.13 

Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to reveal the correlation between sex 

differences and the prevalence, severity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia. 

ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV and spike protein can be primed by TMPRSS2 are 

exploited to entry into target cells, which play an vital role in coronavirus pneumonia 

infection.14We also performed an integrated bioinformatic analysis, leveraging data 

from bulk microarray, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell tRNA 

sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) 

to provide valuable clues of possible underlying mechanism. 

Materials and Methods 

Systematic review and Meta-analysis 

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria 

Two of the investigators (W.X. and W.J.) independently retrieved relevant 

literature from the databases including PubMed, Web of Science, bioRxiv and 

MedRxiv preprint servers from inception to March 19, 2020. We searched studies 

with no language restrictions to analyze the association between sex difference with 

prevalence, severity and mortality of the patients with the 2019-nCoV infection. 

Keywords and relative variant search terms were utilized as follows: SARS-CoV-2 

and COVID-19. These terms were combined with "AND" or "OR". We first reviewed 

the titles and abstracts of the retrieved citations (excluding conference abstracts and 

critical articles), and then evaluated the eligibility for inclusion of the full text that 

was deemed pertinent. 

We searched the literature on cases of the 2019-nCoV infection reported in 

different countries since December 2019. We excluded studies that may overlap based 

on the relative information reported in the studies, such as the time of patient data 

collection, hospital units and departments. We uniformity defined ICU patients, 

ARDS patients, severe patients and critical patients as severe group in our study. 

Inclusion criteria should comply with the following:1) observational studies that 

involved patients with the 2019-nCoV infection had a detailed description of the sex 

ratio, number of severe or dead patients; 2) studies with the most reported cases if 

data overlap with another document. Exclusion Criteria: 1) studies that did not 

provide available full text; 2) studies not reported separately for gender or no desired 

data; 3) data overlapping. 

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment 

Two investigators extracted independently the data from eligible studies. Any 

discrepancy was resolved by consensus. The following information was abstracted: 

the last name of the first author; date of manuscript acceptance or publication; date of 

patient collection; total patients in the study; number of male participants, number of 

female participants; number of severe cases; number of severe male cases; number of 

severe female cases; number of cases with comorbidities; number of deaths; number 

of male deaths; number of female deaths and smoking history. 

We evaluated potential sources of bias in included studies using the appraisal tool 

to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies (AXIS) (Supplementary Table S1) .15   

Pooled Analysis   

The data of individual studies were summarized. We attempted to perform 

analysis of sex difference predisposition of incidence, severity, and mortality in 

patients COVID-19. Subgroup analyses of sex differences predisposition of severity 

were also carried out according to the average age of patients in included studies. 

Meta-analysis was undertaken with Stata v12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, 

TX, USA) software, the results of which were presented in forest plots. Heterogeneity 

among studies were estimated using fixed-effects and random-effects models, which 

was reported using the Cochrane’s Q-test 16 and the inconsistency index value (I²) 17. 

Funnel plots and Egger test were used to assess for publication bias and small study 

effects. All hypothesis tests were two-tailed. P < 0.05 was considered statistically 

significant. 

For any outcome measurement that is otherwise not meta-analyzable, we 

presented an albatross plot,18 which is a novel graphical tool for presenting results 

from studies, allowing an approximation of underlying effect sizes and the potential 

identification of heterogeneity sources across studies. The albatross plots were 

constructed using Stata v14.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). 

Bioinformatic Analyses 

Single-cell RNA Sequencing Analysis Pipeline 

Single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis was performed by 

NovelBio Bio-Pharm Technology Co.,Ltd. with NovelBrain Cloud Analysis Platform. 

We applied fastp 19 with default parameter filtering the adaptor sequence and removed 

the low quality reads to achieve the clean data based on the GSO datasets (Normal 

Prostate: GSE117403 and Normal Lung tissue: GSE122960). We downloaded the 

aggregated matrix. Cells contained over 200 expressed genes and mitochondria UMI 

rate below 20% passed the cell quality filtering and mitochondria genes were removed 

in the expression table. 

Seurat package (version: 2.3.4, https://satijalab.org/seurat/) was used for cell 

normalization and regression based on the expression table according to the UMI 

counts of each sample and percent of mitochondria rate to obtain the scaled data. PCA 

was constructed based on the scaled data with top2000 high variable genes and top 10 

principals of 20 PCs were used for tSNE construction and UMAP construction. 

Utilizing graph-based cluster method, we acquired the unsupervised cell cluster result 

based the PCA top 10 principal and we calculated the marker genes by 

FindAllMarkers function with wilcox rank sum test algorithm under following 

criteria:1. lnFC > 0.25; 2. P value<0.05; 3. min.pct>0.1. 

  The corresponding websites for the datasets, if available, were used for 

downloading figures for visualization of scRNA-seq data of normal human tissues of 

the prostate (https://strandlab.net/) and the testis 

(https://humantestisatlas.shinyapps.io/humantestisatlas1/). 

Cell Communication Analysis.   

To enable a systematic analysis of cell–cell communication molecules, we 

applied cell communication analysis based on the CellPhoneDB,20,21 a public 

repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions. Membrane, secreted and 

peripheral proteins of the cluster of different time point was annotated. Significant 

mean and Cell Communication significance (p value<0.05) was calculated based on 

the interaction and the normalized cell matrix achieved by Seurat Normalization. 

Differential Gene Expression Analysis 

To identify differentially expressed genes among samples, the function 

FindMarkers with wilcox rank sum test algorithm was used under following criteria:1. 

lnFC > 0.25; 2. P value<0.05; 3. min.pct>0.1. Volcano plot was constructed by the R 

package “ggplot2”. 

Co-regulation Network Analysis 

To discover the gene co-regulation network, find gene modules function of 

monocle3 22 was used with the default parameters.     

GO analysis 

Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to elucidate the biological functions 

or processes of the differentially expressed gene in the experiment.23 GO annotations 

were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), UniProt 

(http://www.uniprot.org/) and the Gene Ontology website 

(http://www.geneontology.org/). Fisher’s exact test was utilized to identify the 

significant GO categories and q-values were calculated for false discovery rate 

control.   

Pathway Analysis 

KEGG database was used to figure out the significant pathways enriched. 

Fisher’s exact test was utilized to select the significant pathway, and the threshold of 

significance was defined by FDR cutoff values.24   

Bulk Microarray/RNA-seq Data Analysis 

Microarray data available from public repositories were accessed from GSE5901 

and GSE 56188 using the R package “GEOquery”. Gene expression analysis and 

visualization were performed using custom R codes. Correlation between genes were 

analyzed using the publicly available TCGA datasets at the TIMER 2.0 website 

(http://timer.cistrome.org/).25   

ChIP-seq analysis 

ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project26 were analyzed using the WashU 

EpiGenome Browser.27 Human tissue samples or standard cell lines with both AR 

ChIP-seq data and histone mark ChIP-seq data available were selected.   

Results 

Study Selection and Characteristics 

We recorded the selection process and completed a PRISMA flow diagram 

(Figure 1). From a total of 1561 records identified and screened by abstract and title, 

108 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Among these, 69 were excluded 

due to lack of gender distinction or overlapping data. Thirty-nine studies, published 

between February 7, 2020 and March 17, 2020, were finally filtered for qualitative 

analysis and quantitative meta-analysis , thirty-four from China and five from other 

countries (Table 1), 5-8,10,13,28-60including a total of 77932 patients with an approximate 

average age of 61.04. Most studies were retrospective study, and ten were descriptive 

case series. The comprehensive characteristics of patients subsumed are displayed in 

Table 1, including gender ratio, severe cases, smoking history, death cases and 

comorbidity information. Three variables were analyzed for the meta-analysis in our 

systematic review.   

Meta-analysis results 

The comprehensive results of our meta-analysis are presented in Figure 2, Table 2, 

Table3 and Table 4. Thirty-nine studies involving 77932 patients were assessed in the 

comparison of the sex differences in patient composition. Part of the reported cases 

 
are concentrated in Wuhan, China, but from different hospitals. Overall, male 

accounted for 53.3% of all patients and female accounted for 46.7% (41510, 36408 

respectively). Among the patients included, the number of males was higher than that 

of females (39 studies; 77932 patients; Odds = 1.12), especially in the Chinese 

population (34 studies; 50488 patients; Odds = 1.13). Because the sex-specific 

numbers of the general population in the investigated areas are typically not provided, 

a meta-analysis for sex-specific incidence or morbidity is not feasible. We therefore 

provided an albatross plot for visualization of the comparison of the male proportion 

in each study with 0.5 (Figure 2A). It can be observed from the albatross plot that 

studies with large sample sizes and low p values tend to report a male proportion over 

0.5. Twenty-one studies (3905 patients) reported the severe cases according to the 

setting standards mentioned above. Regarding the severe case rate (Figure 2B), the 

male group exhibited a prominently increased severity rate compared with the female 

group (21 studies; 3905 patients; OR = 1.63; 95% Cl = 1.28-2.06, P=0.000). Subgroup 

meta-analysis suggested that in patients with average age > 50 yr, the male had 

significantly higher severity rate than female (OR = 1.94; 95% Cl = 1.16-3.26, 

P=0.000). However, in patients with average age < 50 yr, the male group only 

exhibited a marginally increased severity rate compared with the female group (OR = 

1.45; 95% Cl = 1.07-1.96, P=0.006, Figure 2C). A total of 8 studies included 

information of smoking history with available information about percentage of severe 

cases.8,10,39,43,44,55,58,60 With the percentage of positive smoking history ranged from 

5.6% to 23.3%. A total of only 252 cases with smoking history were reported against 

the study outcome. We consider it would be inappropriate to pool the results for 

stratified analysis based on the limited cases. In the 39 studies mentioned above, a 

total of 8 studies (50936 patients) provided mortality information. The pooled 

estimate of OR of mortality for male group compared with the female group indicated 

significant survival risk for male (8 studies; 49869 patients; OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 

1.51-1.93, P=0.000) (Figure 2D).     

Heterogeneity, Publication bias and Sensitivity analysis 

Regarding the severity and mortality, moderate heterogeneity was observed 

(I2=40.9%, I2=0.0% respectively). However, heterogeneity increased when analysis of 

patients’ sex composition was conducted (overall I2=95.8%, China subgroup 

I2=57.2%). Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B indicate that no significant 

publication bias for the gender composition and severe rate analysis was observed, 

which was confirmed by Eggers test (Table S2) (p=0.777, P = 0.055, respectively). In 

addition, there was no published bias for mortality analysis (Supplementary Figure 

S1C) (Egger’s test: P = 0.376). The influence of each study on the combined results 

was detected by sensitivity analysis. Table S3 and Table S4 show that no individual 

study significantly affected the combined OR. 

Identification of Sex-Based Differential Gene Expression   

To explore the molecular aspects of the potential sex-based physiological and 

immunological differences, we first analyzed a published human lung tissue scRNA-

seq datasets. After data processing and quality control procedures, transcriptomic 

profiles for 43358 cells from human lung samples were acquired (Figure 3A). 

We identified 19 clusters using graph-based clustering method. Based on marker 

gene expression, a total of 10 cell types were identified, including pulmonary alveolar 

type I (AT1) cells, AT2 cells, ciliated & goblet cells, endothelial cells, Fibroblasts, 

Macrophages, monocytes, plasma cells, and T cells. Comparison of the abundance of 

different cell types in male and female lung tissues was presented in Figure 3B. Most 

cell fractions do not differ greatly between tissues of male and female origins, except 

for plasma cells which are preferably enriched in female samples. Given the 

comparable percentages of total AT2 cells, men have a significantly higher percentage 

of ACE2-expressing AT2 cells. Feature plot also revealed a higher level of ACE2 

expression in male lung tissue, especially in AT2 cells (Figure 3C). We performed a 

co-expression network analysis in the cells from male samples and discovered that, 

among others, androgen receptor (AR) exhibited a co-expression pattern with ACE2 

(Figure 3D). 

To further elucidate the role of sex-based impact on ACE2 expression and 

downstream effects, differential expression analysis was performed between ACE-

expressing cells of male and female origins (Figure 4A). We discovered that the 

down-regulated genes in the male populations were enriched in pathways related to 

viral infections and immune response (Figure 4B). Intercellular communication 

analysis using CellPhoneDB revealed an active state of ACE-expressing AT2 cells, 

with ACE2 functioning both as a receptor and a ligand (Supplementary Figure S2). As 

cytokines are essential regulators of infection and immune response, we focused on 

the differential sex-based differential expression patterns on cytokines (Figure 4C). 

We discovered that IL6ST, a receptor of IL6, is expressed both in male and female 

population, with an average expression higher in male populations. Pro-inflammatory 

cytokines and chemokines, including CCL14, CCL23, IL7, IL16, and IL18, are also 

preferentially expressed in men, underlying the higher susceptibility of men 

developing cytokine release syndrome. TNFSF13B, which has been shown to be 

associated with the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 

pneumonia, is highly expressed in the monocyte-macrophage lineages of men. In 

contrast, cytokines with reported protective effects against viral infections, including 

CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, are highly expressed in women.   

In addition, we looked at scRNA-seq data of tissues from normal, male-specific 

organs including prostate and testis (Supplementary Figure S3-4). Two independent 

scRNA-seq datasets of the healthy human prostate tissues demonstrated that ACE2 is 

expressed in most prostate epithelial cell clusters, pericytes, and fibroblasts. scRNA-

seq datasets of the testis revealed that ACE2 is preferentially expressed in Leydig and 

Sertoli cells. These data have provided evidence that prostate and testis could be 

potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in men. 

Androgen receptor positively regulates ACE2 and 

TMPRSS2 

Previous reports have highlighted the role of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as 

dependencies for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.14 The role of AR acting as a transcription 

factor to activate the expression of TMPRSS2 has already been studied extensively in 

the context of various malignancies. We hypothesized that AR could also directly 

regulate ACE2 expression. At the single-cell level, we found a positive correlation 

between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression (Figure 5A, Pearson correlation coefficient 

r = 0.713). To verify this expression pattern across the spectrum of human tissues, we 

tested the correlation of expression level of AR and ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the TCGA 

PANCAN dataset (Figure 5B). We found that expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is 

positively correlated with AR, irrespective of tissue types. We then utilized publicly 

available microarray datasets to investigate the impact of chemical or surgical 

castration, which lowers the level of androgens, on the expression level of these two 

genes. Unsurprisingly, both in vitro and in vivo studies (Figure 5C-D) demonstrated 

that castration leads to the decline of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which could be reversed 

through androgen supplementation. To understand the mechanism underpinning the 

positive correlation between AR and ACE2, we analyzed publicly available ChIP-seq 

datasets and found that, around 4000 bp upstream of ACE2 transcription start site 

(TSS), there is overlap between AR ChIP-seq peaks and H3K4me1/H3K27ac ChIP-

seq peaks (Supplementary Figure S5-6), indicating that AR likely binds to the 

enhancer regions and promotes the expression of ACE2. 

Discussion 

In recent months, SARS-CoV-2 quickly becomes a serious public health issue 

worldwide. 59-62 COVID-19 is a species of coronavirus family, which is homologous 

with the SARS virus and MERS virus, causing diseases ranging from common cold to 

severe pneumonia. 63,64However, the knowledge of the COVID-19 remains poorly 

 
understood. Altogether, the disease could be divided into four clinical types, including 

mild, moderate, severe and critical pneumonia. 7 Recently, the epidemiology and 

clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported. 60,61,65,66 

However, few studies have focused on the sex differences in the prevalence, severity 

and death of COVID-19. 

This study is the first meta-analysis to appraise the role of gender in the incidence 

rate, morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our pooled results 

demonstrated that gender played a prone role in COVID-19 infection. Concretely, 

male patients exhibited higher morbidity, incidence of severe disease and mortality 

compared with female patients. Of the 77992 patients with COVID-19 included in our 

study, 53.3% were men, indicating that men were more likely to be infected with sars-

cov-2 than women. Unanimously, in the analysis of 1755 SARS cases by Karlberg et 

al. 67    the mortality rate of men was significantly higher than that of women (21.9% 

vs 13.2%, P < 0.0001). Leung et al, 68 showed that in SARS patients, men were more 

likely to experience adverse events. It is worth noting that there is no clear evidence 

of sex differences in the prognosis of influenza. 69-71 The sex differences of morbidity 

and prognosis is believed as a characteristic of coronavirus infection. In addition, we 

discovered that male patients with age > 50 yr were associated with a greater risk of 

progressing to severe cases or ICU cases. Interestingly, the epidemiological data from 

the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic and recent MERS also indicated that there might be 

sex and age-dependent differences in disease outcomes. According to the 

epidemiology analysis of SARS in the 2003 Hong Kong epidemic, both increasing 

age and male sex were associated with a greater risk for death.68 Channappanavar et 

al. infected mice with SARS-CoV and demonstrated that male mice were more 

susceptible to SARS-CoV infection compared to age matched females. Furthermore, 

the degree of sex-bias to SARS-CoV infection in middle-aged mice was more 

pronounced compared to young mice.72 Together, these data suggested that older male 

patients with COVID-19 should get more attention and prepared for ICU treatment 

when they were still mild cases.   

The specific mechanism of sex differences is not clear. Some studies have shown 

that different outcomes between males and females may pertain to the possibility that 

estrogen protects women from worse clinical outcomes during SARS-CoV 

infection.67,73 In a risk factor analysis of patients with COVID-19, smoking history 

was identified as a risk factor for disease progression.43 It was illustrated that the 

expression of ACE2 is significantly higher in the lungs of smokers, which might be 

the reason for higher percentage of sever cases in smokers. Notably, the smoking rate 

of men is typically much higher than that of women.12 This seems to explain the 

results theoretically, however, there was only a small proportion of cases with 

smoking history and thus the influence of smoking on sexual differences seems to be 

weak. Another possible explanation is the different levels of ACE2 expression. 

Current results show that SARS-CoV-2 enter into cells through ACE2, and the 

receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV    possess homologous 

affinity to ACE2. 74 Research has shown that Compared with SARS-CoV, the 

receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding force to ACE2 than 

that of SARS-CoV-2.75Anterior studies have reported that the high expression of 

ACE2 receptor in idiosyncratic organs of SARS patients pertains to the corresponding 

specific organ failure.76,77 It should be noted that the ACE2 gene is pitched on the X 

chromosome. Studies have shown that men had higher levels of circulating ACE2 

than women and patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.78 Therefore, due to 

the high expression of ACE2, male patients may be more likely to develop severe 

symptoms and die of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to that, spike protein promotes the 

attachment and entry of coronavirus into target cells by binding to its cellular 

receptor.79 Recent studies have confirmed that in COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 also relies 

on the priming of spike protein by TMPRSS2 to enter target cells. Inhibitors of 

TMPRSS2, as a clinical option, can block virus entry.14 However, the mechanisms 

need further elucidation. 

In our study, single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human lung tissue samples 

revealed that ACE2 expression is higher in male lung tissue than in female, and that 

AR is co-expressed with ACE2/TMPRSS2. It is worth mentioning that androgen 

expression is significantly higher in men than women. This is consistent with our 

findings that COVID-19 has a higher incidence severity and mortality in men. We 

speculate that AR may be one of the important factors causing gender differences in 

COVID-19. Our further integrated bioinformatic analysis revealed that in LNCaP 

prostate cancer cell line, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 decreased 

significantly after treatment with the AR inhibitor bicalutamide. Similarly, in the 

prostate of castrated mice, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 decreased 

significantly, and their expression was up-regulated after supplementation with 

androgen. These evidences suggest that anti-AR may be a new strategy for treating 

males with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further research is needed to confirm 

this speculation. 

A great quantity of patients with severe COVID-19 infection have experienced 

cytokine release syndromes, or “cytokine storms”.60 Previous cases of infectious 

diseases such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus infections 

have also demonstrated that cytokine storms can trigger the immune system to attack 

the body violently, which is a momentous cause of acute respiratory distress 

syndrome and multiple organ failure.80-82 A previous study demonstrated that there 

was a positive correlation between the severity of pneumonia and the cytokine storm 

and inflammatory response caused by intravascular virus.83,84 IL-6 is the main 

proinflammatory factor causing cytokine storm, which can significantly damage organ 

function, as well as IL-7, IL-16 and IL-18.45,85,86 Our study observed that the 

expression levels of Il-6ST, IL-7, IL-16 and IL-18 in male were significantly higher 

than that in female. These findings and observations may help to explain why the risk 

of severe events in male is strikingly higher than in female. 

Our data revealed that CCL14, CCL21, and CCL23 (important pro-inflammatory 

factors) have increased expression in the lungs of male patients with COVID-19, 

which may promote COVID-19-related cytokine storms. In flu disease, type I 

interferon-mediated production of the CCL2 recruits inflammatory dendritic cells 

(IDCs) to the tracheal epithelium, which is conducive to virus control.87 Previous 

studies have shown that CCL3, CCL4 can inhibit HIV-1 from entering CD4 T cells 

and play a protective role.88 CXCL16, mainly located in the respiratory epithelium, is 

a ligand for CXCR6 playing an important role in homeostasis of Resident memory T 

cells in the respiratory tract.89 In our study, the expressions of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, 

and CXCL16 were lower in male patients than female patients, which may aggravate 

the condition of male COVID-19 patients to a certain extent. BAFF (gene name 

Tnfsf13b) is closely related to B-cell activation and adaptive humoral immune 

response. BAFF is elevated in lung tissue of COPD patients and can cause lung 

inflammation and injury. 90 Therefore, our data show that BAFF expression is 

increased in male COVID-19 patients, which may worsen the condition. 

Admittedly, there remain certain shortages in our systematic review. First of all, 

only thirty-nine studies were incorporated which focused on the morbidity, severity 

and mortality of COVID-19 infection. These studies are mostly from China. Up to 

March 28, 2020, more than 600,000 cases have been reported worldwide. Most of 

aforementioned cases have not been covered and published in the available studies. 

With an intensified body of case studies being reported, more large population and 

superior quality studies could be embedded to consolidate our findings. Secondly, our 

systematic review was consisted of 39 individual studies with various contexts, which 

may induce insufficient statistical availability and dispersive results to a lesser extent. 

Third, in rare cases, there is no way to determine which reports are repeated. there 

may be some overlap in patients among different studies, especially most of the 

included Chinese studies were summarized in the national report.7 However, in the 

sensitivity analysis, the results were still consistent after omitting the Chinese national 

report in the analysis (Figure 4A). As for the heterogeneity of gender composition 

analysis, it may be attributed to a different baseline ratio of male and female in each 

region. 

There may be sex differences in the susceptibility and diseases progression of 

patients with COVID-19. The clinical symptoms of male are more serious than those 

of women, and the outcome of hospitalization is less favorable. From the results of 

integrated bioinformatic analyses, it can be postulated that androgen deprivation 

therapy, frequently adopted in the treatment of prostate cancer, could potentially exert 

a protective and therapeutic effect against the coronavirus. Nevertheless, the findings 

of the study should be interpreted with caution. Large population-based studies are 

needed to verify these findings.
