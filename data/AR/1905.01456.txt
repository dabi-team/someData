We calculated the cross sections of ultra-soft x-ray bremsstrahlung in electron scattering by Ar,
Kr and Xe. The results are consistent with the absolute values of the diﬀerential cross sections
measured by Gnatchenko et al [Phys. Rev. A 80, 022707 (2009)] for scattering electrons with an
energy of 600 eV on these atoms.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst experimental measurements of the relative
probability of the bremsstrahlung (BS) in the long-wave
region of the spectrum in the scattering of electrons in
thin metal targets were performed in the Ref. [1]. The
experimental data were well described by Sommerfeld’s
theory [2], which is actually the theory of BS at the
Coulomb center, taking into account the exponential
shielding of the nucleus by atomic electrons [3]. The
corresponding computations were carried out in Ref. [4].
Absolute measurements of BS intensity for atomic targets
(Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) were performed for the ﬁrst time, as far
as we know, in Ref. [5]. Incident electron energies in [5]
were 28 and 50 keV. The experimental results proved to
be in qualitative agreement with the theory that takes
into account not only the traditional BS mechanism [2]
(ordinary BS), but also the polarization BS, in which a
photon is emitted by an atomic target [6–8]. However,
experimental and theoretical results quantitatively diﬀer
quite signiﬁcantly, and this diﬀerence increases with the
BS photon energy decrease.

The recent paper [9] presents results of highly accurate,
(cid:39) 5.5%, absolute cross sections of BS in the process of
scattering of electrons with the energy of 20..100 keV
upon thin targets C, Al, Te, Ta, and Au. This article also
provides references to previous absolute measurements
for thin solid targets. The results obtained in [9] are
consistent with the theoretical data presented in the
Refs. [10–12]. However, the authors of [9] claimed that
the accuracy of the existing BS theory is insuﬃcient
to compare it with high-precision experiments. The
measurements in Ref. [9] did not observed polarization
BS. However, this fact is not surprising, since the atoms
of the used targets do not have large polarizabilities
in the regions of the BS photon frequencies under
consideration. It is noteworthy that in [9], as in [5], the
agreement between theory and experiment worsens as the
photon energy decreases. This statement is considered

by the authors of Ref. [9] as one of the most important
results obtained by them. However, papers [5, 9] did not
investigate the ultra-soft x-ray photon energy region.

The presented above analysis of the literature shows
that the study of BS for atomic targets, is not only
for studies of BS
interesting by itself, but is useful
generated in electron scattering on solid-state targets
(except for the above references, see e.g. [13, 14]). In
addition, these data are useful in studies of BS in the
scattering of electrons by molecules. As an example serves
Ref. [15], that presents investigation of BS generated in
electron scattering upon molecules CH4.

Since, as already noted, the greatest discrepancy
between the experimental data presented in [5, 9] and the
theory is exists in the small photon energies region, the
data obtained in Refs. [16, 17] are of particular interest.
These works present results of absolute, not relative, as
in [1], measurements of BS cross sections values for ultra-
soft x-ray photons (λ = 7..18 nm) generated in scattering
of electrons with energies of 0.4..2 keV on Ar, Kr, and Xe
atoms. The experimental data diﬀer by a factor 3..4 from
the calculations of Pratt et al. [10, 11], carried out with
an accurate account of the phases of the electron wave
functions in the static atomic potential, but with the
radial dependence of these functions that corresponds to
the free motion of the scattered electron. Note, however,
that the papers [16, 17] present BS data for electrons of
intermediate energies, where the Born approximation is
invalid. Let us remind that the ﬁrst Born approximation
is suﬃcient only if the speed of incoming electron is much
higher than the average speed of all atomic electrons,
including the innermost ones. Corresponding numerical
examples are given, e. g., in Ref. [18].

The important results reported in Refs. [16, 17], have
no theoretical explanation yet. In this paper, some of
these results, namely, the values of BS cross sections,
including the limiting extrapolated values at inﬁnitely
large wavelengths of BS photons, we interpret on the
basis of the soft-photon approximation (SPA) of quantum

 
 
 
 
 
 
electrodynamics [3],

ω (cid:28) E/(cid:126),

(1)

where ω is the frequency of the BS photon and E is the
energy of the electron in the initial state. Previously,
the SPA was used to interpret ultra-soft x-ray spectra
in Refs. [19–22]. Recall that the SPA takes into account
both elastic and inelastic scattering of an electron by
an atom, as well as polarization BS. To be able to take
into account the polarization BS, it is necessary that the
energy of the BS photon be much less than the binding
energies of atomic electrons that lie oﬀ shall of the mass
surface, unlike free electrons [3]. However, in the case
considered here, this condition is not fulﬁlled; therefore,
the polarization BS is not considered here by the SPA.

II. BASIC FORMULA

frame

In the

of SPA and in non-relativistic
approximation, the double diﬀerential cross section of BS
for electron scattering on a certain target is presented as
the product of the diﬀerential cross section of electron
scattering on the same target without radiation, dσS, and
the probability of photon radiation dwγ [3],

where α (cid:39) 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant, v and
v(cid:48) are electron velocities in the initial and ﬁnal states,
respectively, k is photon momentum, and dΩγ is the solid
angle of photon departure. We employ the relativistic
system of units in which (cid:126) = c = 1. In equation (2)
averaging over the electron spins in the initial state,
summation over its spins in the ﬁnal state and summation
over the photon polarizations are carried out. If the
direction of ﬂight of the electrons is not ﬁxed as in
the experiment [16, 17], then it is necessary to perform
integration over this direction in the equation (2) . To do
this, we direct the axis z along the vector v and write
dσS as

dσS(θ) = σS(θ)dΩv(cid:48),

(3)

where θ is the polar angle of the vector v(cid:48). We assume a
spherical symmetry of the target, so dσS does not depend
on the azimuthal angle of v(cid:48). Substituting (3) in (2), we
obtain,

where Θ is the polar angle of the vector k (the angle
between the vectors v and k), the azimuthal angle of the
vector k is assumed to be zero, ϕ is the azimuthal angle of
the vector v(cid:48). In experiments [16, 17] the angle Θ (cid:39) 83◦.

where na, ne are densities of atoms and electrons,
respectively, ∆V is eﬀective volume of interaction of
electrons with atoms, from which radiation originate. To
obtain dI/dλ dΩγ in normal units, one has to multiply
Eq. (6) by (cid:126)/c.

Note that in Ref. [1] in the region of large wavelengths,
the dependence dI ∼ 1/λα with 1.8 < α < 2.7
was observed. This dependence does not contradict
dependence dI ∼ 1/λ2, which follows from Eq. (6).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In experiments [16, 17], the volume of interaction of
electrons with atoms ∆V (cid:39) 0.1 cm3, and radiation was
collected from the ﬁnite solid angle ∆Ωγ (cid:39) 1.7 × 10−3 sr
in the wavelength interval ∆λ (cid:39) 0.1 nm. The intensity of
BS emitted from this spatial region and in the speciﬁed
wavelength interval is denoted by ∆I. It follows from Eq.
(6) that for large wavelengths, the value of λ2dI/dλ dΩγ
is independent upon λ. We see it from Fig. 1 that depicts
the values of λ2∆I obtained from Fig. 4 in Ref. [17].
The impressive maximum in BS cross section dependence
on the radiation wavelength observed in the case of Xe
is a direct manifestation of the polarization BS. It is
possible that the relatively small growth of λ2∆I at small
λ in Fig. 1 has the same origin. Note, however, that
such non-monotonic behavior is located, as it should be
for polarization BS, only in a limited wavelength range,
where polarizability of Xe is high (giant resonance in
photoabsorbtion [6, 23]. One should have in mind that
polarizabilities of Ar and Kr in the considered λ region
are on the contrary small. As one can see from Fig. 1,
the SPA is applicable for Xe in the wavelength range
16..18 nm, where λ2dI/dλ dΩγ is almost constant.

3

under the integral over θ, the accuracy of theoretical
calculations of the cross section should be suﬃciently
high. Previously, this circumstance was noted in Ref. [19].
The results of theoretical calculations are given in
Table I. The same Table includes experimental data from
Fig. 1. One should have in mind that the experimental
error of absolute measurements is 40%. As one can see,
for Kr and Xe, the theoretical values lie within the range
of experimental values and slightly out of it for Ar.

IV. CONCLUSION

The presented results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the
quantitative agreement of theoretical and experimental
ordinary BS cross sections in electron-atomic collisions
at low energies of BS photons. This result does not
apply to the polarization BS, for the manifestation of
which requires the fulﬁllment of special conditions. These
conditions are well-known [6–8] and are (a) high optical
polarizability of atoms (optical breakthrough of alkaline
metals was the ﬁrst experimental proof of polarization BS
[26]), or high X-ray polarizability as in Xe atom (Fig. 1),
(b) laser-assisted electron scattering on very small angles
[27–29] etc.

In addition, these same results present an independent
veriﬁcation of high accuracy of diﬀerential cross sections
of elastic scattering of electrons on atoms that we take
from Refs. [24, 25].

To calculate σS(θ) we limited ourselves to elastic
scattering and we used the data from Refs. [24, 25].
Note that the elastic scattering cross section σS(θ) has a
pronounced maximum at small angles, where the function
f (θ), deﬁned by Eq. (5), has a minimum at the value Θ
used in the experiment. In the maximum of the function
f (θ), which is at θ (cid:39) 100◦, the cross section σS(θ) is less
than its maximum by 2..3 orders of magnitude. Since
the functions σS(θ) and f (θ) enter Eq. (6) as a product
