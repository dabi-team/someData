(Received July 10, 2017; Revised September 14, 2017)

We describe a device (adapter) for oﬀ-axis guiding and photometric calibration of wide-

angle spectrographs operating in the prime focus of the 6-m telescope of the Special Astro-

physical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. To compensate coma in oﬀ-axis

star images an achromatic lens corrector is used, which ensures maintaining image quality
(F W HM ) at a level of about 1′′ within 15′ from the optical axis. The device has two 54′′-
4 .′5 rectangular areas. The device

the telecentrism condition allows the spectrograph to be illuminated both by a source of line

spectrum (a He–Ne–Ar ﬁlled lamp) and by a source of continuum spectrum. The latter is

usually represented either by a halogen lamp or a set of light-emitting diodes, which provide

illumination of approximately uniform intensity over the wavelength interval from 350 to

900 nm. The adapter is used for observations with SCORPIO-2 multimode focal reducer.

INTRODUCTION

The six-meter Big Telescope Alt-Azimuth (BTA) is the ﬁrst large telescope on an altazimuth

mounting with machine-controlled tracking of target objects [1]. This was a pioneering technical

solution for up to the time (late 1960s) which gave rise to the use of altazimuth mounts for large,

massive telescopes. Besides the speciﬁcs of guiding, which required the use of a computer-assisted

control system, altazimuth mounting is, unlike parallactic mounting, distinguished by the rotation

of the ﬁeld of view. Note that the accuracy of the tracking of the observing object is determined

not only by the quality of telescope mechanics, but also by the variation of atmospheric conditions.

Therefore long exposures in a large ﬁeld of view require oﬀ-axis guiding to be performed using at

least two guide stars. Whereas one star is used to correct the guiding of the telescope mounting, the

second star serves to take into account the error of the compensator of the rotation of the ﬁeld of

view. The latter is maximal in observations made in the prime vertical and at small zenith angles,

where the rate of change the parallactic angle is the fastest. The telescope was initially equipped

with a standard Ricci cassette meant for photographic observations in the prime focus within a
18′-diameter ﬁeld. This device had two movable oﬀ-axis guiding microscopes.

Mounting of heavy-weight electrooptical devices (long-slit, multiobject, and integral-ﬁeld spec-

trographs, focal reducers, etc.) in the prime focus of the 6-m telescope for recording images in a

large ﬁeld of view made it necessary to seek new design solutions for oﬀ-axis guiding. The use of

schemes like the Cassegrain adapter of the 3.6-m ESO telescope [2] in the prime focus is fraught

with a number of problems. The high focal ratio (f /4) and small oﬀset of the focal plane above

the plane of the rotating table make it impossible to implement the optomechanical scheme with

movable ﬁelds using lens collectives.

An adapter was developed for the prime focus of the 6-m telescope. It underwent a stage-by-

stage upgrade, which included incorporating results of new technologies and software solutions. As

of now, there have been four versions of this adapter:

1. In the ﬁrst version of the adapter guiding ﬁeld images were transferred to a single ﬁeld via

optical ﬁber bundles. The entrance ends of the bundles could move in the radial and tangential

directions in the focal plane of the telescope, and the exit ends were ﬁxed in the focal plane of

the guiding eyepiece. Stars were searched manually by the observer, and guiding by stars was

performed visually. On the 6-m telescope such guiding scheme was ﬁrst used in 1979 for the

optical identiﬁcation of 5C survey radio sources using McMullan electronographic camera [3].

The good guiding quality made it possible to acquire very deep images with this camera and

observe faint galaxies down to 25th magnitude [4].

2. The next version of the adapter was equipped with a wavelength calibration lamp, and the

images from ﬁber bundles were transferred to LI-702 TV camera and preampliﬁed with an image

converter tube. The adapter was controlled by a remote controller and a long communication link

from the observers’ room located inside the dome of the 6-m telescope. Beginning with 1990 this

adapter was used for observations with three versions of MPFS integral-ﬁeld spectrograph [5,

6] and MOFS multiobject spectrograph [7].

It was also used for the ﬁrst observations with

SCORPIO multimode prime focus reducer [8].

3

3. Beginning with 2001, observations with SCORPIO and MPFS instruments continued with a new

adapter having fundamentally upgraded design: lens correctors of guiding ﬁelds were mounted

to correct the coma of the primary mirror, a “ﬂatﬁeld” lamp, a bundle focusing mechanism,

and an adjustable crosshair illumination were added, and calibration optics were upgraded to

ensure telecentric illumination from the integrating sphere. The movable units and lamps were

controlled by a microprocessor, which, in turn, was controlled by the host computer located at

the prime focus of the telescope. Since 2007 the TV tube in the guide view was replaced by a

CCD camera. Automatic search for guide stars was implemented based on USNO 2.0 catalog.

This adapter version, which was described in [8, 9], is still used (summer of 2017) with SCORPIO

instrument for remote observations performed from the Main Laboratory building of the SAO

RAS, 5 km from the 6-m telescope.

In this paper we present the new, fourth version of the adapter. It was designed based on our

wide experience from previous modiﬁcations, and incorporating such capabilities as correction of the

telescope focus during exposures and control of atmospheric transmittance. Section 2 describes the

overall layout of the adapter and particularities of its implementation; Section 3 describes guiding

and the properties of the view, Section 4 discusses the features of the calibrating unit, and the

Conclusions section presents the main points of the work.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ADAPTER

2.1. General Scheme

The adapter is mounted on a rotating table in the prime focus of the 6-m telescope and is

used both for oﬀset guiding and for telecentric illumination of the entrance pupil of the instrument

installed on it by various light sources. The adapter can be used for mounting SCORPIO-2 focal

reducer and other spectrographs with mass no greater than 150 kg and ﬂange focal distance no

greater than 40 mm.

Figure 1 shows the optical layout of the adapter. The adapter has two movable ﬁelds of view to

search for guide (reference) stars. The light from such a star ﬁrst comes to oﬀ-axis lens corrector (3),

which compensates coma of the primary mirror of the telescope. Then, diagonal mirror (4)redirects

the light beam to the entrance end of ﬁber bundle (5), which together with the mirror is moved

across the ﬁeld in two perpendicular directions by STANDA linear translation stages1. The ﬁber

bundle has a diameter of 54′′ in sky projection, and can move within a 10′
4 .′′5 ﬁeld. The centers
of guide ﬁelds are located at a distance of 12′ from the center of the ﬁelds of view of the system. The

×

relative arrangement of the ﬁelds is presented in Subsection 3.2. The images of the exit ends of the

bundles are projected by lens (6) and directed by prism (7) and diagonal mirror (9) onto the focal

plane of guiding CCD (8). Mirror (9) has two working positions — FIBERS (9a) and FIELD (9b).

Figure 1 shows both positions. In the FIBERS position light from observed objects is received by

the equipment mounted on the adapter (the mirror is oﬀset from the beam), and the guiding CCD

captures images of guide stars. In the FIELD position the diagonal mirror transfers the image of

the science ﬁeld of view to the guide view (the mirror covers the central beam), making it possible

to perform ﬁeld identiﬁcation and to position bright objects onto the slit. The size of the FIELD

2.2. Oﬀ-axis Lens Corrector

The main problem in oﬀset guiding on the 6-m telescope is coma aberration of the parabolic
mirror. Standard prime focus corrector compensates aberrations in the 18′ large ﬁeld and cannot be

used in our scheme, because the instruments mounted onto the adapter work without lens corrector.

We developed and constructed a relatively simple two-lens corrector made of domestic-manufactured

K8 and TFZ glass. The corrector is achromatized in the 0.5–0.7 µm wavelength interval and yields

an equivalent telescope focal distance of 18.5 m. Figure 2 shows the optical layout of the corrector.

The focal surface of the corrector FC within the range of motion of the ﬁber bundle is ﬂat to the
ﬁrst approximation. It is tilted by 3 .◦9 with respect to the telescope focal plane FT .

Figure 3 shows the result of coma correction at an oﬀset of about 12′ from the primary mirror

axis. Figure 4 shows the computed polychromatic point-spread function of the corrected image. As

is evident from the ﬁgure, the seeing (F W HM ) of the image produced with the use of the corrector
is 40 µm or better, which corresponds to about 1′′; it is quite suﬃcient for guiding purposes. The
optical layout was computed using ZEMAX program2.

2.3. Guide View

We ﬁrst used LI-702 TV transmitting tubes with a preampliﬁer based on an image converter

tube with a microchannel plate as guide views. Since 2007 standard industrial 1/2-inch monochrome

Sony ICX 429ALL CCD sensor with 582

×

752 pixels is used as the guide view. Its parameters are

controlled by RS-232 interface, and the image is digitized by a TV tuner. By the end of 2017 it is

planned to be replaced by commercial Atik Titan3 camera based on a similar Sony ICX424 sensor

with the images transmitted to the computer via USB interface.

illustration we also show the R-band magnitudes of some stars. In the FIELD mode the size of

(FIBERS mode). Because of absorption in ﬁbers, transmission in the FIBERS is twice lower than

in the FIELD mode. However, the sensitivity of the guiding CCD is suﬃcient for reliable detection

of moonless sky background.

2.4. Control System

The adapter is controlled like other SCORPIO-2 units. Two boards have been developed that

are equipped with ATmega8535L microprocessors and power chips to control seven step motors and

adapter calibrations. One board controls four motors used to move two guide ﬁelds along the X

and Y axes and two motors for focusing these ﬁelds. Another board controls the FIELD/FIBERS

diagonal mirror switch, line spectrum lamp (NEON), continuum spectrum lamp (QUARTZ), and

32 LEDs that produce the ﬂatﬁeld.

The ranges of all movements are controlled by limit switches. The current position (X, Y ) of guide

ﬁelds and the focus are computed from the number of steps made from the initial position. External

control commands are transferred to the microprocessor via standard RS-422 interface from the

industrial computer operating under Windows OS. Microprocessor programs are set for autonomous

operation: after receiving a command they run it and report the result when requested by the control

computer. The adapter control interface is written in IDL language4 and is incorporated into the

overall SCORPIO-2 control software.

3. GUIDING

After pointing the telescope to the target object and before starting the guiding the observer

should perform a number of preliminary procedures including a search for guide stars, selection

of optimum brightness on the view, and preliminary centering. Then the guiding application is

run and if the position of the star image centroid diﬀers from the position set by the observer in

the guide view the program sends the appropriate correction commands to the telescope control

program.

Figure 6. Program interface for searching for guide stars.

3.1. Program for Searching for Guide Stars

To accelerate pointing and the search for guide stars, we use IDENTSTAR program written in

IDL, which allows computing the current instrumental coordinates of guide stars in the adapter

ﬁeld of view based on the coordinates and orientation of the rotating table transmitted from the

control server of the 6-m telescope. Figure 6 shows the appearance of the program interface for

searching for guide stars.

When started, the program reads the current telescope coordinates from the server of the 6-m
telescope and selects from USNO 2.0 catalog the coordinates of all stars brighter than 20m located
in the given sky area within the radius of 15′. The large central square in the window marks the
6′), and the rectangles indicate the limits of the motion

selected by the program. Their magnitudes and positions in the coordinate system of the adapter

are indicated in the bottom right ﬁelds of the program window. If necessary, the observer can select

another guide star among those available in the ﬁeld. The computed star conﬁguration in terms of

FIELD/FIBERS positions is displayed together with the star chart from the catalog. Observational

experience shows that it usually takes no more than several minutes to search for and set the guide

stars. Note that preliminary setting of stars can be performed while the telescope is repositioned

from one object to another.

3.2. Guiding Program

For automatic guiding based on a selected star we use our TVGuide program written in IDL,

whereas the C++ program written by E. A. Ivanov for operating AverMedia type TV tuners is used

to digitize the view image at a 25 Hz frequency. In addition to visualising the guide view image the

program can also superimpose electronic crosshairs and labels. Depending on the adapter mirror

position in the large window, the program also displays either the slit position in the FIELD ﬁeld

with the target object or two crosshairs used to aim stars in the FIBERS guiding ﬁelds.

3.3. Limiting Magnitudes

In the guiding process the tuner polls the guide view output at a frequency of 25 frames per

second; to improve the noise properties the images are moving averaged with a 2 to 50 frame window.

their USNO 2.0 magnitudes. Intensities were precorrected to take into account the gain of the CCD

view, which is set separately for each guide star. The dashed lines show the night-sky noise levels
for the 3σNS and 5σNS detection thresholds. The regression line crosses the dashed lines at 18 .m0
and 17 .m4, yielding the R-band limiting magnitudes for the signal-to-noise ratios of S/N = 3 and 5,
respectively. The optimum magnitude range for guiding is 10m–15m. Guiding by stars fainter than
15m is possible only under conditions of good seeing and suﬃcient transmittance.

Note that because of the peculiarities of the control system of the 6-m telescope automatic

coordinate correction is performed with a frequency no higher than 0.1 Hz.

3.4. Control of Atmospheric Transmittance and Guiding Quality

The zero point for each ﬁber bundle of the guide view was calibrated using observations of real

stars under good transmittance conditions. The results of this calibration are shown in Fig. 8.

After the calibration procedures were performed it became possible to control atmospheric trans-

mittance using guide stars. Note that the calibration relations are further reﬁned during observa-

tions. According to our estimates, systematic errors of atmospheric absorption measurements due

to the diﬀerence between the response curves of the view detector and the RUSNO-band ﬁlter do
not exceed 0 .m5.

To control the guiding quality, the user may display the plot showing the current absorption,

the size of the image of the guide star and the azimuth and zenith distance oﬀsets (see Fig. 9).

plots (from top to bottom): R-band absorption, seeing, oﬀset of the centroid of the guide star along the

azimuth and zenith distance (in arcsec). Right: the current parameter values. Bottom: the status line.

3.5. Focusing

The entrance end of each guiding ﬁber bundle can move along the optical axis within 0–9.7 mm

to achieve focusing of the guide star (see Fig. 1). This makes it possible to correct the telescope

focus during a long (more one hour) series of spectroscopic observations. Observational experience

on the 6-m telescope shows that during that time variations of the focal length caused by thermal

deformations of the telescope tube beams may exceed 0.1–0.2 mm, which is quite signiﬁcant in
the case of good seeing (θ < 2′′). With the telescope and guiding microscopes focused before the

beginning of the exposure series, the best focus position can then be controlled using the mechanism

of focusing of guiding ﬁelds, and a compensating correction can be applied to adjust the focal

distance of the telescope. The presence of two guiding ﬁelds allows the focus to be controlled by

one of the stars while the other ﬁeld is used for telescope tracking.

4. CALIBRATION UNIT

4.1. General Description

The calibration unit consists of an integrating sphere (Ulbricht sphere), calibration illuminator

optics, and control system. The integrating sphere has two line-spectrum illuminators, a continuum-

12

spectrum illuminator, and 32 ports for mounting illuminating LEDs. The line-spectrum source used

is a He–Ne–Ar-ﬁlled SGZ-3S gas-discharge radio lamp. The sources of continuum spectrum are an

Osram Halopar-16 50W quartz tube and an array of 32 LEDs.

The optics of the calibration illuminator produces at the reducer input a converging beam with

the focal ratio equivalent to the focal ratio of the telescope (f /4). The image of the uniformly

illuminated area at the input of the integrating sphere is formed at the same place where the image

of the telescope mirror is located (the output pupil) and hence the telecentrism condition is fulﬁlled.

The projected diameter of the illuminator area coincides with the diameter of the pupil. In our case

the telecentrism condition is fulﬁlled to within 0.2% or better. Such a solution makes it possible

to perform correct wavelength calibration using line-spectrum lamp and calibrate the transmission

variations of the system across the ﬁeld in diﬀerent modes of spectroscopic observations (“ﬂatﬁeld”).

The output area of the integrating sphere is illuminated in three ways:

•

•

•

NEON: by a He–Ne–Ar-ﬁlled lamp for wavelength calibration. It is used in the modes of slit and

integral-ﬁeld spectroscopy, and also in observations with the scanning Fabry–Perot interferome-

ter [10]. Calibration is usually performed every time when the zenith distance of the telescope
changes by more than 10–20◦ with the allowance for instrument ﬂexures.

QUARTZ: by a halogen-ﬁlled quartz-tube continuum-spectrum lamp for creating “ﬂatﬁeld.” Cali-

bration is usually performed at the beginning and at the end of observations made in the scanning

interferometer mode, and several times during the night in spectroscopic observations made at

diﬀerent zenith distances. A serious downside of such illuminator is the abrupt decrease of the

lamp brightness in the blue spectral range, because the intensity maximum is at the wavelength

of about 1200 nm. As a result, at wavelengths λ < 500 nm the observed spectrum of the lamp is

signiﬁcantly contaminated by the scattered light from the longer-wavelength part of the spectrum.

The use of equalizing ﬁlters slightly improves the situation.

LEDS: by a system of light-emitting diodes that forms continuum spectrum for the “ﬂatﬁeld”

with approximately uniform intensity distribution over a wide range of wavelengths. This allows

performing uniformly precise ﬂatﬁeld illumination in diﬀerent spectral ranges and reducing stray

light in the blue region. Such a solution was ﬁrst proposed for photometric calibration on small

telescopes [11, 12] and it has so far not been used on large telescopes. For example, a system of

18 LEDs is planned to be used in the “white light” illuminator of EXPRES spectrograph [13].

Let us now consider in detail the latter illumination option provided by light-emitting diode

system LEDS.

4.2. Light-Emitting Diode System

Modern industry oﬀers a wide range of various light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for the entire op-

tical wavelength range. Each LED emits continuum spectrum in a narrow, about 10–20 nm wide

 
 
14

wavelength interval. The brightness of individual elements in such a LED array can be selected so

as to construct spectral “ﬂatﬁeld” for various grisms taking into account spectral sensitivity of the

instrument mounted on the adapter.

We use pulse-width modulation to control the brightness of individual LEDs. To each LED a

rectangular-wave signal is sent with diﬀerent duty ratio, which varies discretely from 0 to 253. Such

realization is easy to implement and it ensures high stability of LED brightness. LEDs are controlled

by the microprocessor mounted on the second board (see Section 2.4). The program started at the

control computer in the IDL environment allows choosing either standard illumination conﬁguration

or setting the brightness of LEDs individually.

To illustrate LEDS technique, we show in Fig. 10 an example of the “ﬂatﬁeld” constructed for

VPHG 940@600 grism with the operating wavelength interval 3500–8500 ˚A.

4.3. Stability of LEDs

The calibrating lamp consisting of a set of LEDs must ensure repeatability of the form of the
20...+40◦C. We estimate the stability of the luminous

spectrum in the temperature interval ∆T =

−

ﬂux of the diode due to the change of external temperature T from the following empirical relation

adopted from [14]:

where F300 is the LED ﬂux at the close-to-room temperature and T1 is the characteristic temperature

for the given class of LEDs. The experimental T1 values for blue, green, and red LEDs – 1600, 295,

and 95 K, respectively, are adopted from [14]. As is evident from equation (1), the ﬂux of red

LEDs is most sensitive to temperature variations and therefore the variations of the form of the

spectrum should be the strongest in this wavelength range. Let us estimate its stability adopting

the sensitivity of the ﬂux of red LEDs as the worst case. Let us diﬀerentiate expression (1):

and compute the temperature coeﬃcient of ﬂux in the case of the change of the temperature by one

temperature range for red LEDs.

When estimating the possible ﬂuctuations of the spectrum of the lamp one must take into account

the fact that during spectral exposure (5 to 60 minutes) the temperature at the primary focus of
the telescope does not change by more than 1–2◦C.

To estimate the actual stability of LED illumination, two series of spectral “ﬂatﬁelds” were

obtained in the laboratory with SCORPIO-2 using VPHG 940@600 grism: one series was acquired

over 10 hours at 1-hour intervals, and another series was acquired over 1 hour at 1-minute intervals.

Figure 11 shows the relative variations of the “ﬂatﬁeld” as a function of wavelength. Domain

A shows the scatter for the 10-hour experiment, which approximately simulates the situation for a

single observing night. For comparison, we show domain B, which corresponds to computed Poisson

noise. We calculated Poisson noise as 1/√Ns

×

gain, where Ns is the number of counts at the given

wavelength and gain is the gain of the CCD. The thick line shows the actual noise in the spectrum,

which agrees well with the theoretical level. Domain C shows the scatter for the 1-hour experiment,

which approximately simulates the situation for observations of a single object. One-hour variations

(C) can be seen to be lower than Poisson noise (B). We determined the variations of both data
series and the Poisson noise within 200 ˚A-wide bins.

Note that despite small variations of the ambient temperature over 10 hours (they remain within
5◦C limits), the amplitude of variations can be seen to gradually increase with wavelength from 1%
to 2%. Variations drop to 1% after 7500 ˚A and this behavior reﬂects the contribution of the second

order of VPHG 940@600 grism, and illumination in this wavelength range is also produced by blue

LEDs.

Thus the “ﬂatﬁeld” produced using LEDS technique yields more uniform illumination compared

to the “ﬂatﬁeld” produced using QUARTZ technique (Fig. 10). It would be reasonable to suggest

that the hybrid QUARTZ+LEDS “ﬂatﬁeld”, where LEDS corrects the drawbacks of QUARTZ tech-

nique in the blue part of the spectral range, should be the optimum solution. However, the LEDs

and the quartz tube are located too close to each other, and the quartz tube heats up strongly

when turned on, and therefore the LED properties change when both types of illumination are used

simultaneously. This fact should be taken into account in observations and when designing similar

systems. In the case of spectroscopic observations performed during the night we recommend us-

ing LEDS before QUARTZ (if both types of illumination are necessary), and separate their use in

16

calibrations before and after observations.

The fact that LEDs are now widely used and relatively inexpensive suggests that such technique

can be easily implemented on modern spectrographs.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The latest, fourth version of the adapter, which, like the previous two versions, was developed at

the Laboratory of spectroscopy and photometry of extragalactic objects of the Special Astrophysical

Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has been used for observations with SCORPIO-2

focal reducer [15] since 2012 .

Compared to the previous version of the adapter, which is still (summer 2017) used with SCOR-

PIO, the new version has substantially reduced chromatic aberrations in guiding ﬁelds, and the

spectral ﬂatﬁeld calibration is now formed by the combined emission of the LED array, which made

it possible to increase the signal in the blue part of the spectrum multiple times.

Let us now point out the main features of the presented adapter:

1. To transfer the images of the guide stars to the guiding CCD two ﬁber bundles are used with

possible individual focusing during observations.

2. The use of oﬀ-axis lens corrector made it possible to correct coma of the guide star images up

to about 15′ from the optical axis.

3. The optics of the calibration illumination is made to fulﬁl the telecentrism condition.

4. LED system allows achieving relatively uniform spectral illumination of the CCD taking into

account its response curve and the transmission curves of the grisms.

5. Photometry of the images of guide stars during observations is used to qualitatively control

atmospheric transmittance and focusing of the telescope.

The guiding and calibration system described has been successfully tested for many years on the

6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
