ABSTRACT:  We  describe  a  new  micro-pattern  gas  detector  structure  comprising  a  multi-layer 
hole-type multiplier (M-THGEM) combined with two in-built electrode meshes: the Multi-Mesh 
THGEM-type  multiplier  (MM-THGEM).  Suitable  potential  differences  applied  between  the 
various electrodes provide an efficient collection of ionization electrons within the MM-THGEM 
holes  and  a  large  charge  avalanche  multiplication  between  the  meshes.  Different  from 
conventional hole-type multipliers (e.g. Gas Electron Multipliers - GEMs, Thick Gas Electron 
Multipliers – THGEMs, etc.), which are characterized by a variable (dipole-like) field strength 
inside the avalanche gap, electrons in MM-THGEMs are largely multiplied by a strong uniform 
field  established  between  the  two  meshes,  like  in  the  parallel-plate  avalanche  geometry.  The 
presence of the two meshes within the holes  allows for the  trapping of a large fraction of the 
positive ions that stream back to the drift region. A gas gain above 105 has been achieved for 
single photo-electron detection with a single MM-THGEM in Ar/(10%)CH4 and He/(10%)CO2, 
at  standard  conditions  for  temperature  and  pressure.  When  the  MM-THGEM  is  coupled  to  a 
conventional THGEM and used as first cascade element, the maximum achievable gains reach 
values above 106 in He/(10%)CO2, while the IBF approaches of 1.5% in the case of optimum 
detector-bias configuration. This IBF value is several times lower compared to the one obtained 
by a double GEM/THGEM detector (5-10%), and equivalent to the performance attained by a 
Micromegas detector.

Since  the  beginning  of  the  current  century,  one  of  the  main  trends  in  Micro-Pattern  Gaseous 
Detectors (MPGDs) focuses on the development of brand-new gas avalanche structures [1]. The 
ultimate goal is to find alternative solutions able to further overcome the limitations of the current 
MPGD architectures and to fulfil the most stringent constraints imposed by future facilities. This 
includes operation in harsh experimental  conditions as well as increasingly  higher operational 
performance.  

As a result, the search for an efficient suppression of the ion-backflow (IBF) is an extremely 
active field of research, driven by development of Gaseous Photo-Multipliers – GPMs [1], [2], as 
well as by the spread of continuous-mode Time Projection Chambers (TPC) applications in high 
energy physics and in other areas [3], [4]. A low level of IBF allows one to reduce secondary 
effects (i.e. secondary electron emissions) and the photocathode aging induced by ion impacts [5] 
in GPMs. In addition, it prevents space-charge field distortion induced by ion migration into the 
drift volume in TPCs, which causes significant loss of the event topology resolution [6]. Finally, 
a  lower  amount  of  ions  impinging  on  the  cathode  surface  may  also  reduce  the  probability  of 
sporadic discharges due to cathode-excitation effect [7], particularly at high rate.  

For a single avalanche multiplier, i.e. a single Gas Electron multiplier (GEM) [8] or a MI-
CRO-MEsh-GAseous Structure (Micromegas) [9], the IBF is proportional to the ratio between 
the drift and the avalanche fields, while for multiple hole-type architectures low IBF is achieved 
by  a  suitable  gas  gain  sharing  between  the  various  cascade  elements,  as  well  as  an  accurate 
optimization  of  the  transfer  fields  between  them.  Micromegas  detectors  offer  a  natural 
suppression of the IBF by efficiently trapping the slow ions on the mesh, leading to IBF values 
below  1%  in  normal  operational  conditions  [10].  Typical  IBFs  of  the  order  of  5%-10%  are 
achieved in two-cascade GEM/thick-GEM [11] detectors, in standard gas mixtures (i.e. Ar-based 
mixtures) and at gain of 103-104 [11], [12]. A further lower IBF value (down below 5%) can be 
achieved in a multi-element (two/three) THGEM/GEM detector by staggering the hole alignment 
between the various multipliers [13].  

The Micro-Strip Hole Plate (MSHP) [14], the COBRA [15] and the thick-COBRA [16] are 
examples of hybrid MPGD designs formed in a single structure that combine micro-hole electron 
multiplier geometry with patterned electrode surfaces for ion defocusing. A cascade of MSHPs 
(or thick-COBRA) was reported to reach ion blocking at the level of 10-2% in DC mode [15].

Even lower IBF values of around 10-4% at a gain of 105 were attained with multi-elements detector 
comprising two GEMs sandwiched between two COBRA multipliers [15]. However, the major 
drawback of MHSPs (as well as of the thick-COBRA structures) is the loss of effective area on 
its top surface, where the reflective photocathode is deposited. In addition, the distortion of the 
dipole field geometry on the top surface of the MHSPs due to the presence of the reverse-biased 
strip electrodes contributes to a significant loss of electron collection efficiency [13]. A similar 
effectual IBF reduction of close to few 10-4% for gains of a several thousand has also been attained 
with  double-mesh  Micromegas  devices,  thought  at  the  expense  of  a  low  electron  transfer 
efficiency (computed as only 40%) [17]. Double-mesh Micromegas are presently limited in size 
to a few tens of cm2. 

This  work  presents  and  discusses  a  novel  micro-pattern  gaseous  detector  structure  (the 
Multi-Mesh THGEM-type multiplier – MM-THGEM) that merges the double-mesh Micromegas 
design  [17]  and  the  robust  multi-layer  THGEM  [18].  The  former  serves  for  avalanche 
amplification  and  IBF  suppression,  while  the  latter  provides  a  rigid  support  for  large  area 
coverage. We discuss the operational principle, present a short description of the manufacturing 
procedure, and report first measurements of effective gain and ion backflow.  

2. M-THGEM with in-built meshes: manufacturing and operational principle 

The  MM-THGEM  accommodates,  in  a  single  micro-structure,  two  very  different  gas 
avalanche concepts: the parallel-plate type micro-mesh and the hole-type (multi-layer THGEM) 
multiplier.  

The  Multi-layer  Thick  Gaseous  Electron  Multiplier  (M-THGEM)  is  one  of  the  newer 
members of the MPGD family [18], [19], consisting of a single, robust assembly of two/three 
THGEM elements laminated together. The large thickness of the insulator substrate results in a 
solid structure that provides large area coverage without the need of supporting frames, generally 
used with more fragile structures to avoid deformations caused by electrostatic forces. Upon the 
application of a voltage difference across the various outer and inner electrodes, a strong dipole 
field  is  established  within  the  M-THGEM  holes,  which  is  responsible  for  a  high  electron 
collection efficiency and stable charge avalanche multiplication.

Different than the conventional multi-layer M-THGEM,  the inner electrodes of the  MM-
THGEM consist of two micro-meter meshes to form a small (0.2 mm in this work) amplification 
gap  (figure  1).  The  electrons  are  efficiently  focused  into  the  holes,  transported  into  the  small 
avalanche gap sandwiched between the two meshes, and therein multiplied by a strong uniform

electric field (figure 2a). The electric field on the outer regions of the holes may also impart a pre- 
and  post-  electron  amplification  depending  on  the  operational  mode  and  the  voltage  bias 
configuration.  

Due to the high field gradient between the amplification gap (delimited by the two meshes) 
and the upper pre-amplification region, a fraction of the ions produced in avalanche, as well as 
the ions coming from underneath multiplier elements, are trapped on the uppermost mesh (see 
figure 2b). Another large fraction of the avalanche ions are further trapped on the top surface of 
the  MM-THGEM  due  to  the  dipole  field  geometry,  while  the  rest  migrates  back  to  the  drift 
volume.  Figure  2b  shows  an  example  of  electron/ion  transport  and  avalanche  simulation 
performed with Garfield/Magboltz [20], [21] package, which qualitatively illustrates the process 
of ion backflow reduction in MM-THGEM detector.

voltage difference of 500 Volt applied across the various (inner/outer) electrodes.  

In  the  present  work  we  have  tested  the  performance  of  a  first  MM-THGEM  prototype 
characterized by holes with a 0.7 mm diameter and a 1 mm spacing. The prototype is made out 
of three copper-cladded glass epoxy plates (EMC 370-5). The two outer insulator substrates are 
0.5 mm thick while the inner substrate, which separates the two meshes and defines the avalanche 
gap, is 0.2 mm thick. The three boards (PCB1, PCB2 and PCB3 in figure 3) are mechanically 
drilled using the same approach of the conventional THGEM production. On the top surface of 
PCB1 and bottom surface of PCB3, small (0.1 mm) copper rims were etched around the holes by 
a  photolithographic  technique  to  reduce  the  discharge  probability  due  to  mechanical  defects. 
Before the mechanical drilling, the inner surfaces of the PCB boards were laminated with a thin 
layer of B-stage epoxy glue (yellow layers in Figure 3), which allows for the fastening of all the 
electrodes in a solid structure. Two thin stainless steel meshes (Bopp 45/18) [22] were precisely 
cut to match the MM-THGEM size and then placed between the boards (Figure 3). Because of 
the holes’ small diameter and the robust support of the insulator substrate, there is no need to 
stretch or frame the meshes, which were freely dropped over the PCB boards’ surfaces. All the 
elements were then  bound  together (Figure  4) using  a vacuum pressing  system (up to 20 bar) 
operated at high temperature (180 OC) to ensure a good uniformity across the effective area and 
close contact between all the various elements. Guiding pins (not included in the figures below) 
were used to prevent misalignment.

Figure 4. The MM-THGEM production is completed by bounding the PCB and the meshes using a vacuum 
press system operated at high temperature.  

Other materials for the insulator substrate can be envisioned: for instance, Plexiglas could 
be a good alternative to the glass epoxy, since it does not required an intermediate B-stage epoxy 
glue layer. The number of the insulator substrates can be selected to create different geometries 
(up  to  a  stack  of  10  meshes)  according  to  the  application  and  operational  requirements.  The 
thickness  of  the  insulator  substrate  can  range  from  0.1  mm  up  to  a  few  mm  (limited  by  the 
mechanical drilling stage). As in conventional Micromegas detectors, different mesh types can be 
used, including electroformed type meshes and the mesh pitch can range from 900 LPI down to 
100 LPI.  

3. Results 

3.1 Effective gain 

The  MM-THGEM-based  detector  prototype  (10×10  cm2  effective  area)  was  installed  in  a 
stainless-steel vessel, evacuated down to 10-6 Torr before gas filling. During normal operation the 
vessel was flushed at a flow of 20-30 sccm. Data was taken after several hours of constant gas 
flow to avoid change in the  gain due to outgassing of the detector components.  The gain was 
measured in current mode [11] by illuminating the MM-THGEM top bare-Cu surface with a high-
intensity UV-lamp through a quartz window, while the current collected on an anode board was 
measured  with  a  high-resolution  pico-ammeter.  All  the  MM-THGEM  electrodes  were 

– 5 – 

 
 
 
 
 
independently powered through a 5 MΩ resistor using modular high-voltage power supplies (Iseg 
model Mhn-30-250-vU CPS series [23]). The transfer field between the MM-THGEM electrode 
and  the  anode  board  (separated  by  2  mm)  was  set  to  500  V/cm  (figure  1).  The  maximum 
achievable gain was defined by the onset of the anode current instabilities; the measurements and 
detector bias were discontinued after the appearance of the first discharges (generally occurring 
between the MM-THGEM meshes).  

The  gas  gain  was  measured  as  the  ratio  of  the  current  collected  at  the  anode  to  the 
photoelectron current extracted from the MM-THGEM top electrode. The photocurrent (typically 
a  few  tens  pA)  was  independently  estimated  by  reversing  the  field  on  the  drift  region  and 
collecting the charges on a cathode grid. The total avalanche current recorded at the anode was 
kept below the limit of 20 nA by means of filters placed between the UV-lamp and the quartz 
window.  

The gain curves of the MM-THGEM was measured for different gas mixtures, He/(10%)CO2 
(Figure 5a) and in Ar/(10%)CH4 (Figure 5b), and for different bias configurations. The latter is 
characterized by the parameter (α), defined as the ratio of the potential difference applied across 
the amplification gap (ΔVMM in figure 2a) to the potential difference applied across the pre- and 
post-amplification regions (ΔVTHGEM in figure 2a). As shown in figure 5, the higher maximum 
achievable  gains  (>105  and  >104  for  He/CO2  and  Ar/CH4  respectively)  were  attained  at  large 
values of α (α>0.75), which corresponds to the configurations where the avalanche processes are 
largely  confined  in  the  small  volume  between  the  two  meshes  with  small  or  no  significant 
contributions to the gain from the pre- and post-amplification regions. Stable higher gain maybe 
also possible for the lower overall operational voltages that are required in these conditions.

3.2 Ion backflow (IBF) 

The  measurements  of  IBF  in  MM-THGEM-based  detector  were  carried  out  with  the 
experimental setup illustrated in figure 6. The MM-THGEM was coupled to a WELL-THGEM 
multiplier  [24]  in  a  two-cascade  arrangement  and  operated  in  He/(10%)CO2  at  atmospheric 
pressure. The transfer gap between the WELL-THGEM and the MM-THGEM was 2 mm wide 
and the transfer field between the two electrodes was kept at a value of 500 V/cm. The two-stage 
detector  arrangement  allows  for  a  larger  detector  gain,  which  is  the  product  of  the  gas  gain

provided by each individual multiplier element. Maximum achievable gains in the range of 105-
106 were achieved depending on the detector bias configuration.  

The ion and electron currents, collected at the cathode and at the anode respectively, were 
read  out  by  two  custom,  fully  floating,  battery  powered  pico-ammeters  characterized  by  a  
resolution at the 1 pA level [25]. The top surface of the MM-THGEM, illuminated by the UV-
light through the quartz window, was electrically connected to an upper grid (5 mm apart) and 
biased thought the pico-ammeter.   

In this work, the IBF is computed as the number of positive ions collected at the drift cathode 
(Iions) normalized by the total number of electrons collected at the anode readout (Ielec). Notice 
that, in the case of single electron detection, the normalization to the current collected at the anode 
is equivalent to the normalization by the effective gain.

Figure 7b depicts the IBF as a function of the total detector gain, measured for three MM-
THGEM operational modes, each of them characterized by different values of the parameter α 
(see definition in section 3.1). The total detector gains were progressively increased by varying 
the bias voltages of the MM-THGEM electrodes, while the voltage difference across the WELL-
THGEM holes was kept fixed at 900 Volt (corresponding to a gas gain of around 20).

As shown in figure 7b, the IBF reaches a constant value of 2% when the gain is above 100 
– this IBF is several time smaller compared to one attained with GEM/THGEM in an equivalent 
detector setup (two-cascade elements). Note that most of the gas gain is delivered by the MM-
THGEM  electrode,  and  therefore  the  IBF  measurements  carried  out  in  these  conditions  are 
basically an indication of the capability of the MM-THGEM to trap ions generated by its own 
avalanches. 

Similar methodology was used to investigate the capability of the MM-THGEM to trap ions 
generated by underneath multipliers (WELL-THGEM in this work) in a cascade detector setup. 
Figure 8b depicts the IBF values measured as a function of the total detector gain, where different 
biases were used to vary the gain sharing configurations between the two multipliers. For instance, 
the black curve in figure  8b shows the results of the  IBF measurements  when  a fixed voltage 
difference  of  1100  Volt  was  applied  across  the  WELL-THGEM  holes,  which  correspond  to  a 
WELL-THGEM contribution of 2000 to the total detector gain.  The blue and red curves were 
obtained by applying a voltage difference of 1000 Volt and 900 Volt across the WELL-THGEM, 
which corresponds to a gain contribution of 400 and 20 respectively (Figure 8a).  

The  results  depicted  in  figure  8b  suggest  that  the  MM-THGEM  is  extremely  efficient in 
trapping ions coming for the lower transfer field; lower IBFs (ranging from 1.5-2%) are obtained 
when the contribution of the WELL-THGEM electrode to the total gain is high (black graph in 
figure  8b).  This  can  be  understood  by  considering  that  while the  ions  generated  by  avalanche 
within the MM-THGEM can be trapped only by the upper MM-THGEM mesh, ions streaming 
upwards  from the  underneath  multipliers  can  also  be  trapped in the  bottom  mesh,  though  this 
process has a lower efficiency due to the negative electric field gradient.

4. Conclusion 

The operational principle and performance of a novel charge avalanche device, the multi-mesh 
THGEM (MM-THGEM), has been presented and discussed for the first time. The basic design 
of the MM-THGEM results from merging the two most popular, though conceptually dissimilar, 
MPGD  architectures:  the  hole-type  (GEM-like)  multiplier  and  parallel-plate  (Micromegas)

avalanche structure. The MM-THGEM consists of two metallic micro-meshes separated by few 
hundred microns (0.2 mm in this work) inserted in a three-layer M-THGEM electrode. Ionization 
electrons from the drift region above the MM-THGEM are collected into the holes and transferred 
into the region between the two meshes where they are multiplied by a strong uniform electric 
field.  

Notice  that  in  a  dipole  field  geometry,  characteristic  of  hole-type  multipliers  (i.e. 
GEM/THGEM), the drifting electrons are subjected to an electric field strength that depends on 
their path inside the hole, which leads to a large range of possible avalanche multiplication factors. 
This results in a large fluctuation of the avalanche statistics, and thus a worse energy resolution 
in  comparison  to  the  parallel-plate  geometry  [26].  In  this  respect,  the  confinement  of  the 
avalanche in the uniform electric field established between the two MM-THGEM meshes might 
result in a good energy resolution compared to the conventional GEM/THGEM devices. On the 
other  hand,  the  negative  field  gradient  at  the  interface  between  amplification  and  post-
amplification  regions  (see  figure  2a)  might  cause  a  loss  of  electron  transparency  of  the  MM-
THGEM bottom mesh, resulting in a degradation of the avalanche statistics. A systematic study 
of  the  energy  resolution  and  of  other  operational  properties  of  MM-THGEM  detectors  for 
different bias and geometries (including operation in a WELL configuration) is planned and the 
results will be presented elsewhere.  

The design and parameter of the MM-THGEM, including the holes size and pitch, as well 
as  the  thickness  of  the  insulator  substrates  can  be  tailored  according  to  the  applications 
requirements and operational conditions. This includes the possibility of assembling two or more 
elements in cascade which provides an increased stability, higher maximum achievable gains, and 
an  overall  lower  IBF.  Furthermore,  the  MM-THGEM  can  be  assembled  in  a  WELL  (close-
bottom) configuration:  namely, the readout anode is placed in direct contact with the surface of 
the bottom MM-THGEM  electrode, closing the  MM-THGEM holes. This alternative  mode of 
operation provides a robust double-mesh Micromegas geometry over large area. In the case of 
spark-induced permanent damages of the meshes or of the insulator substrates, the MM-THGEM 
can easily be dismounted from the readout board and swapped with a new electrode. Note that, in 
the  case  of  single-/double-mesh  Micromegas  directly  populated  over  the  readout  board,  the 
recovering is extremely unlikely and thus the full assembly has to be replaced. Furthermore, by 
operating the MM-THGEM in a WELL configuration, the negative field gradient at the interface 
between  the  amplification  and  post-amplification  regions  can  be  cancelled  out,  leading  in 
principle to a better energy resolutions.  

We have performed a first characterization of the operation properties of the MM-THGEM 
in  standard  gas  mixtures  at  atmospheric  pressure.  Gains  above  105,  104  for  single-electron 
detection, were achieved with a single element in He/(10%)CO2 and Ar/(10%)CH4 respectivelly. 
In a double-cascade MM-THGEM/WELL-THGEM detector assembly the maximum achievable 
gain for single-electron detection reaches values above 106 in He/(10%)CO2.  

One of the immediate advantages of the presence of the two meshes in the MM-THGEM 
structure  is  a  high  capability  to  capture  the  positive  ions.  In  a  double-cascade  MM-
THGEM/WELL-THGEM detector we measured IBFs in the range of 1.5-2%, at a gain of 103-
106. These values are several times lower compared to a similar double GEM/THGEM detectors. 
Moreover, the above IBF values were attained for single photoelectron detection where the top 
MM-THGEM surface and the upper cathode grip were connected together (zero drift field). On 
one  hand,  this  “reflective”  gaseous  photomultiplier  configuration  provides  the  higher  photo-
electron  collection  efficiency  [11].  On  the  other  hand,  all  the  ions  that  escape  the  meshes  are 

– 9 – 

 
 
collected  either  at  the  MM-THGEM  top  surface  or  on  the  upper  cathode  grid  and  all  of  them 
contribute to the IBF. On the contrary, in a typical TPC configuration characterized by a non-zero 
drift field, the Iions is defined only by the fraction of ions that migrate all the way up to the cathode 
grid,  while  a  large  fraction  of  ions  is  further  collected  on  the  MM-THGEM  top  surface.  As  a 
result, lower IBFs (< 1%) may be expected in TPC mode with a cascade of several MM-THGEM 
electrodes.
