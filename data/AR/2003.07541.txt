Abstract

For a ﬁxed graph F , the anti-Ramsey number, AR(n, F ), is the maximum number of
colors in an edge-coloring of Kn which does not contain a rainbow copy of F . In this paper,
we determine the exact value of anti-Ramsey numbers of linear forests for suﬃciently large n,
and show the extremal edge-colored graphs. This answers a question of Fang, Gy˝ori, Lu and
Xiao.

Key words: Anti-Ramsey numbers, Linear forests.

Introduction

In this paper, only ﬁnite graphs without loops and multiple edges will be considered. Let Kn and
Pn be the clique and path on n vertices, respectively. An even path or odd path is a path on even
or odd number of vertices. A linear forest is a forest whose components are paths. For a given
graph G = (V (G), E(G)), if v ∈ V (G) is a vertex of G, let NG(v), dG(v) be the neighborhood and
degree of v in graph G respectively, and if U ⊆ V , let NU (v) be the neighborhood of v in U , and
NG(U ) be the common neighborhood of U in G. An universal vertex is a vertex in V (G) which is
adjacent to all other vertices in V (G). Denote the minimum degree of G by δ(G). Let W and U
be two subsets of V (G), denote the induced subgraph on W of G by G[W ], denote the subgraph
of G with vertex set U ∪ W and edge set E(U, W ) = {uw ∈ E(G), u ∈ U, w ∈ W } by G[U, W ].
An edge-colored graph is a graph G = (V (G), E(G)) with a map c : E(G) → S. The members in
S are called colors. A subgraph of an edge-colored graph is rainbow if its all edges have diﬀerent
colors. The representing graph of an edge-colored graph G is a spanning subgraph of G obtained
by taking one edge of each color in c. Denoted by R(c, G) the family of representing subgraphs
of an edge-colored graph G with coloring c.

For a ﬁxed graph F and an integer n, the anti-Ramsey number of F is the maximum number
of colors in an edge-coloring of Kn which does not contain F as a rainbow subgraph, and denote
it by AR(n, F ). The anti-Ramsey number was introduced by Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os [3] in
1975. They determined the anti-Ramsey numbers of cliques when n is suﬃciently large. Later,
in 1984, Simonovits and S´os [7] determined the anti-Ramsey number of paths.

Theorem 1.1. (Simonovits and S´os, [7]) Let Pk be a path on k vertices with k ≥ 2. If n is
suﬃciently large, then

where ε = 1 if k is even and ε = 0 otherwise.

Moreover, they have given the unique extremal edge-colorings as following. Let U be a vertex
subset of Kn with |U | = (cid:98) k−1
2 (cid:99) − 1, all the edges which are incident with U have diﬀerent colors,
the all edges of Kn[V (Kn) − U ] colored by another one color if k is odd or other two colors
otherwise. Denoted by CPk (n) the family of above extremal edge-colorings of Kn of Pk.

In 2004, Schiermeyer [8] determined the anti-Ramsey number of matchings for n ≥ 3t + 3.

Theorem 1.2. (Schiermeyer, [8]) AR(n, tK2) = (cid:0)t−2
n ≥ 3t + 3.

2

(cid:1) + (t − 2)(n − t + 2) + 1 for all t ≥ 2 and

2

that AR(n, tK2) = (cid:0)t−2

And after that, Chen, Li and Tu [9] and Fujita, Magnant and Ozeki [10] independently showed
(cid:1) + (t − 2)(n − t + 2) + 1 for all t ≥ 2 and n ≥ 2t + 1.
In 2016, Gilboa and Roditty [5] determined that for large enough n, the anti-Ramsey number
of L ∪ tP2 and L ∪ kP3 when t and k are large enough and L is a graph satisfying some conditions.
Very recently, Fang, Gy˝ori, Lu and Xiao [4] have given an approximate value of anti-Ramsey
number of linear forests and determined the anti-Ramsey number of linear forests whose all
components are odd paths.

Theorem 1.3. (Fang, Gy˝ori, Lu and Xiao, [4]) Let F = ∪k
and ti ≥ 2 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Then

i=1Pti be a linear forest, where k ≥ 2,

AR(n, F ) =

where (cid:15) = 1 if all ti are odd and (cid:15) = 2 otherwise.

For a given graph family F, the Tur´an number of F is the maximum number of edges of a
graph on n vertices which does not contain a copy of any graph in F as a subgraph, denote it by
ex(n, F).

The anti-Ramsey problem of linear forest is strongly connected with the Tur´an number of
linear forest. Hence, we introduce some results of the Tur´an numbers of paths and linear forests.
In 1959, Erd˝os and Gallai showed the upper bound of the Tur´an number of Pk as the following

theorem.

Theorem 1.4. (Erd˝os and Gallai, [2]) For any integers k, n ≥ 1, we have ex(n, Pk) ≤ k−2

2 n.

The Tur´an number of linear forest have been determined by Bushaw and Kettle [1] and Lidicky,

Liu and Palmer [6] for suﬃciently large n.

Theorem 1.5. (Bushaw and Kettle, [1]) Let k · P3 be the vertex disjoint union of k copies of P3.
Then for n ≥ 7k, we have

ex(n, k · P3) =

(cid:19)

(cid:18)k − 1
2

+ (k − 1)(n − k + 1) +

(cid:22) n − k + 1

(cid:23)

.

Remark Later, Yuan and Zhang [11] determined ex(n, k · P3) for all values of k and n.

Theorem 1.6. (Lidicky, Liu and Palmer, [6]) Let F = ∪k
and ti ≥ 2 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. If at least one ti is not 3, then for n suﬃciently large,

i=1Pti be a linear forest, where k ≥ 2

ex(n, F ) =

+ c,

where c = 1 if all ti are odd and c = 0 otherwise. Moreover, the extremal graph is unique.

The extremal graph in Theorem 1.6, denote by GF (n), is a graph on n vertices with a vertex
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99)−1) such that all the vertices in U are universal vertices and GF (n)−U

set U of order ((cid:80)k
contains a single edge if each ti is odd or V (G) − U is an independent subset otherwise.

The anti-Ramsey numbers of linear forests which consist of odd paths are determined by
Gilboa and Roditty [5] for AR(n, k · P3) and Fang, Gy˝ori, Lu and Xiao [4] otherwise.
In [4],
they asked the following question: determining the exact value of anti-Ramsey number of a linear
forest when it contains even paths. We will establish the following theorem.

From now on, let F = ∪k

i=1Pti be a linear forest with at least one ti is even, where k ≥ 2,
ti ≥ 2 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Deﬁne CF (n) to be a family of edge-colorings of Kn with a subset U of
order (cid:80)k
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 2, the all edges which are incident with U have diﬀerent colors and the edges
in V (Kn) − U are colored by another 1 + ε colors, where ε = 1 if exactly one ti is even or ε = 0
if at least two ti are even. (see Figure 1).

Figure 1: CF (n), (a) when F contains at least two components with even vertices; (b) when F
contains exact one component with even vertices

Theorem 1.7. There is a function f (t1, . . . , tk) such that if n ≥ f (t1, . . . , tk), then

AR(n, F ) =

(cid:18)(cid:80)k

edge-colorings must be in CF (n).

2 Proof of Theorem 1.7

First, we prove a useful lemma for the extremal problems of linear forests.

 (b) (a)UULemma 2.1. Let G be an F -free graph on n vertices with |V (F )| = f . Let F1 = ∪i∈LPti be a
subgraph of F , where L ⊆ [k] and (cid:80)
i∈L(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) ≥ 2, let F2 = F − F1. If G contains a copy of F1
as a subgraph and

e(G) −

then any copy of F1 in G contains a subset U of order (cid:80)
of size at least 2f 2 + 8f in V (G) − U .

i∈L(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 1 with common neighborhood

Proof. Let G = (V, E) be an F -free graph on n vertices. Assume that G contains a copy of F1
on subset P and p = |P |. Let t = (cid:80)
i∈L(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99). Since G is F -free, G[V − P ] contains no copy of
F2. Hence e(G[V − P ]) ≤ ex(n − p, F2) and the number of edges between P and V − P in G is
(cid:1) − ex(n − p, F2) ≥ (t − 7
at least e(G) − (cid:0)p
4 )n. Let n0 be the number of vertices in V − P which
2
have at least t − 1 neighbors in P , this is,

Then the number of edges between V − P and P is at most n0p + (n − p − n0)(t − 2). Hence

n0 = |{v ∈ V − P : |NP (v)| ≥ t − 1}|.

So,

n0p + (n − p − n0)(t − 2) ≥

t −

n.

n0 ≥

n/4 + p(t − 2)

.

Since there are (cid:0) p
t−1
size t − 1 in P which has at least n0/(cid:0) p

t−1

(cid:1) subsets with size t − 1 in P , and n is large enough, there is a subset U of

(cid:1) ≥ 2f 2 + 8f common neighbors in V − P .

Lemma 2.2. Let Kn be a complete graph on n vertices with an edge-coloring c. Let U and
W be vertex disjoint subsets of V (Kn) with |U | = u, |W | = w and u, w > 0. If there are two
n in R(c, Kn) such that U has at least s common neighbours in L1
n and L2
representing graphs L1
n
and W has at least s + su common neighbours in L2
n, then there is a representing graph Ln in
R(c, Kn) such that U and W have at least s common neighbours in Ln respectively.

Proof. Let X with size s and Y with size s + su be the common neighbours of U in L1
n and the
common neighbours of W in L2
n respectively. Since there are su colors between X and U , there
is a subset Y (cid:48) of Y with size at least s such that the colors between W and Y (cid:48) are all diﬀerent
from the colors between X and U . The result follows.

The following lemma is trivial. We left its proof to the readers.

Lemma 2.3. For large n, AR(n, P2 ∪ P2) = 1 and AR(n, P3 ∪ P2) = 2.

Let t1 ≥ t2 . . . ≥ tk ≥ 2 and

where ε = 1 if exactly one ti is even and ε = 0 if at least two ti are even. Let F0 = F − Ptk .
We begin with a minimal degree version of the anti-Ramsey problem of linear forests.

Lemma 2.4. Let c be an edge-coloring of Kn which does not contain a rainbow copy of F with
at least fF (n) colors and n ≥ g(t1, . . . , tk). If the minimum degree of each representing graph
is at least (cid:80)k
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 2, then the number of colors of c is exactly fF (n), and the extremal
edge-coloring must be in CF (n).

Proof. Let c be an edge-coloring of Kn on vertex set V with at least fF (n) colors. Since
fF (n) >ex(n, F0) when n is suﬃciently large, each representing graph in R(c, Kn) contains a
copy of F0. Let L1
n ∈ R(c, Kn) be a representing graph. Let |V (F )| = f . By Lemma 2.3, we may
assume that F is not P2 ∪ P2 nor P3 ∪ P2, so (cid:80)k
Claim 1. There is a representing graph Ln ∈ R(c, Kn) such that it contains two disjoint vertex
subset U and W 1 of order u = |U | = (cid:80)k−1
i=1 (cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 1 and w = |W | = (cid:98)tk/2(cid:99) − 1 such that
|NLn(U )| ≥ 2f + 8 and |NLn(W )| ≥ 2f + 8 if W (cid:54)= ∅.
Proof. Since F is not P2 ∪ P2 nor P3 ∪ P2, we have (cid:80)k−1

where ε(cid:48) = 1 if tk is even or ε(cid:48) = 0 if tk is odd. Moreover, the equality holds if and only if tk is
odd and at least two ti’s are even. Thus, by Theorem 1.1, it is easy to see that c ∈ CF (n) and
we are done, or Kn contains a rainbow copy of Ptk on subset V − U . So there is a representing
graph L2
n[V − U ] contains a copy of Ptk . If tk ≤ 3, let W = ∅; if tk ≥ 4,
by Lemma 2.1, there is a subset W of V − U of size (cid:98)tk/2(cid:99) − 1 has common neighborhoods of
size at least 2f 2 + 8f in L2
n. Now, by Lemma 2.2, there is a representing graph Ln satisfying the
claim, the proof is completed.

n ∈ R(c, Kn) such that L2

Since (cid:80)k

i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) ≥ 3, we have |U ∪ W | ≥ 1. Let T = V − U − W . We may choose X ⊆ T
and Y ⊆ T be the set of common neighbours of U and W in Ln respectively. By Claim 1, we
have |X| ≥ f + 8 when |U | ≥ 1 and |Y | ≥ f + 8 when |W | ≥ 1.

Claim 2. Let L be the set of common neighbours of U ∪ W in Ln. Then |L| ≥ f + 2.

Proof. If U = ∅ or W = ∅, then the claim is obviously true. Let U (cid:54)= ∅ and W (cid:54)= ∅, then
t1 ≥ t2 . . . ≥ tk ≥ 4. We consider the following two cases: (a) tk is even. Let L3
n be the graph
obtained from Ln by adding an edge ab in Kn[Y ] and deleting the edge cd in Ln colored by c(ab).
Suppose that there are at least three vertices in X (cid:48) = X \ {a, b, c, d} which are not adjacent to
all vertices of W . Since δ(L3
n) ≥ |U ∪ W |, there are three vertices of X (cid:48), say x1, x2 and x3, such
that xi is adjacent to yi ∈ T for i = 1, 2, 3. If two of {y1, y2, y3} are not belong to {a, b}, then we
can ﬁnd a copy of F in L3
n easily. Moreover, the edges in Y (cid:48) = Y \ {a, b, c, d, y1, y2, y3, x1, x2, x3}
can not be colored by c(ab). Otherwise, the graph obtained from Ln by adding an edge colored
by c(ab) in Y (cid:48) and deleting the edge cd contains a copy of F . Now let L4
n be the graph obtained
from Ln by adding an edge x4x5 inside Y (cid:48) and deleting the edge colored by c(x4x5). Note that at
least two of xiyi for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 belong to L4
n and we delete at most one edge between {x1, x2, x3}
and U or between x4x5 and W , we can easily ﬁnd a copy of F in L4
n, a contradiction. Thus
there are at most two vertices in X (cid:48) which are not adjacent to all vertices of W . Hence, we have
|L| ≥ f + 8 − 6 = f + 2. (b) tk is odd. The proof of this case is similar as case (a) and be omitted.
The proof of the claim is completed.

Claim 3. There are at most 1 + ε colors in c(Kn[T ]).

Proof. We only prove the claim for ε = 1, since the case ε = 0 is much easier. Then there
is exactly one ti is even. Take the representing graph Ln with e(Ln[U ∪ W, T ]) maximum and
|NLn(U ∪ W )| ≥ f . That is if z1z2 with z1 ∈ T and z2 ∈ U ∪ W is not an edge of Ln, then z1z2
is colored by c(z(cid:48)

2), where z(cid:48)

1 ∈ T and z(cid:48)

2 ∈ U ∪ W .

1z(cid:48)

If Ln is connected, suppose that there are at least three colors in c(Kn[T ]). Then by
Lemma 2.3, we can assume that Ln[T ] contains a copy of P3 ∪ P2. Let P2 = ab and P3 = xyz.
We take e(Ln[x, U ∪ W ]) as large as possible. Thus x is adjacent to U ∪ W . And ab is connected
to U ∪ W ∪ {x, y, z} by a path, let P = wP w(cid:48) be the shortest path starting from ab ending at
U ∪ W ∪ {x, y, z} with w ∈ U ∪ W ∪ {x, y, z}. If w ∈ U ∪ W , then V (P ) ∩ {x, y, z} = ∅. If
|U ∪ W | = 1, then {u} = U ∪ W . Thus we can easily ﬁnd a copy of F (Note that F = P5 ∪ P2,
F = P4 ∪ P3 or F = P3 ∪ P3 ∪ P2). Let |U ∪ W | ≥ 2. If e(Ln[{x}, U ∪ W ]) = 1, the edges between
x and U ∪ W are colored by the same color. We can take any edge of Kn[{x}, U ∪ W ] for Ln. If
e(Ln[{x}, U ∪ W ]) ≥ 2, then there are at least two edges between Ln[{x}, U ∪ W ]. Thus in both

6

cases, we can take an edge xu between x and U ∪ W with u (cid:54)= w. Thus we can easily ﬁnd a copy
of F , a contradiction. Now we may suppose w ∈ {x, y, z}. If w ∈ {y, z}. Then xyP w(cid:48) or xyzP w(cid:48)
contains a copy of P4 ending at x, so one can ﬁnd a copy of F in Ln. If w = x. If xP w(cid:48) contains
at least four vertices, one can ﬁnd a copy of F in Ln; otherwise, we may assume that xa is an
edge in Ln. If z is adjacent to U ∪ W in Ln, then zyxa is a copy of P4 which is connected to
U ∪ W , then Ln contains a copy of F ; if for there is no edge between U ∪ W and z in Ln, then
we may add an edge zz(cid:48) with z(cid:48) ∈ U ∪ W delete the edge in Ln colored by c(zz(cid:48)). Thus the new
representing graph contains a copy of F , a contradiction.

Assume that Ln is disconnected. Let C1 be the component of Ln containing U ∪ W , Z =
V − V (C1) and Q = V (C1) − U ∪ W . By the similar argument above, c(Kn[Q] contains at most
n be the graph obtained from Ln by adding an edge vv(cid:48) inside L and deleting
two colors. Let L5
the edge colored by c(vv(cid:48)). Since L5
n[Z] is Ptk -free. So, we have
e(L5

n[V (C1)] contains a copy of F0, L5

2 |Z| < fF (n), a contradiction. The claim is proved.

n) ≤ (cid:0)|U ∪W |

Since e(Ln) ≥ fF (n), by Claim 3, we have c ∈ CF (n). The proof is completed.

Proof of Theorem 1.7. Let c be an edge-coloring of Kn contains no rainbow copy of F with at
least fF (n) colors and n ≥ f (t1, . . . , tk), where f (t1, . . . , tk) (cid:29) g(t1, . . . , tk). Suppose that each
representing graph in R(c, Kn) has minimum degree at least (cid:80)k
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 2. Hence, by Lemma
2.4, we have the number of edge-coloring in c is fF (n) and c ∈ CF (n).

Now, we may assume that there is a representing graph Ln ∈ R(c, Kn) with δ(Ln) ≤
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 3. So there is a vertex un in V with degree at most (cid:80)k
(cid:80)k
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 3 in Ln. Let
Gn = Kn and Gn−1 = Kn − un. Then Gn−1 is an edge-colored completed graph on n − 1 vertices
with at least fF (n − 1) + 1 colors. If each representing graph in R(c, Gn−1) has minimum degree
at least (cid:80)k
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 2, then similar as the argument above, we have Gn−1 contains a rainbow
copy of F . Hence, there is a vertex un−1 in Gn−1 with degree at most (cid:80)k
i=1(cid:98)ti/2(cid:99) − 2. Thus
we may construct a sequence of graphs Gn, Gn−1, . . . , Gn−(cid:96) such that the number of coloring of
Gn−(cid:96) is at least fF (n − (cid:96)) + (cid:96) (note that f (t1, . . . , tk) (cid:29) g(t1, . . . , tk)). Note that there are at
most (cid:0)n−(cid:96)
2

(cid:1) colors in Gn−(cid:96), we get a contradiction when (cid:96) is large.
