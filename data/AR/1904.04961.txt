Abstract

Fine structure in the α decay of 223U was observed in the fusion-evaporation reaction 187Re(40Ar, p3n) by using fast digital pulse
processing technique. Two α-decay branches of 223U feeding the ground state and 244 keV excited state of 219Th were identiﬁed
α3−−→ 211Rn. The α-particle energy for the ground-state to ground-state
by establishing the decay chain 223U
transition of 223U was determined to be 8993(17) keV, 213 keV higher than the previous value, the half-life was updated to be 62+14
−10
µs. Evolution of nuclear structure for N = 131 even-Z isotones from Po to U was discussed in the frameworks of nuclear mass
and reduced α-decay width, a weakening octupole deformation in the ground state of 223U relative to its lighter isotones 219Ra and
221Th was suggested.

1. Introduction

Light actinide nuclei with neutron number N ∼ 134 are
susceptible to eﬀects of octupole deformation [1, 2]. Alpha
decay is long known as one of the tools to search for the
eﬀects of octupole correlations in nuclei.
In particular, the
ﬁrst experimental evidence for octupole deformation in the
actinides came from ﬁne structure α decays feeding low-lying
1− and 3− states in the A = 220-224 isotopes of Ra [3] and
Rn [4]. Static or dynamic octupole deformations were expected
to exist in light actinides with mass number A between 219
and 229 [5]. The strongest octupole coupling for actinides was
supposed to occur at Z ∼ 88 and N ∼ 134 [2], heavier than
the doubly magic nucleus 208Pb in the chart of the nuclides.
When going towards 222Ra from 208Pb, nuclear ground-state
shape undergoes three phases: spherical, quadrupole-octupole
and quadrupole deformed shapes. The N = 131 isotones are
situated in a transitional region between N = 126 spherical and
N = 134 octupole deformed nuclei.

The N = 131 isotones of Z = 84 and 86, i.e., 215Po and
217Rn, have nearly spherical ground states with Jπ = 9/2+,
corresponding to the odd neutron in the νg9/2 orbital.
In
the α decay of 215Po and 217Rn, ground-state to ground-state
transition comprises nearly 100% of the total α-decay intensity,

reﬂecting the remarkable similarity between the parent and
daughter conﬁgurations.

In heavier N = 131 isotones 219Ra (Z = 88) and 221Th
(Z = 90), experimentally ﬁne structure in the α decays were
observed. Onset of quadrupole-octupole correlations was
predicted in the framework of the reﬂection-asymmetric rotor
model [6]. Moreover, dynamic octupole correlations were
indicated in the γ spectroscopy in 219Ra [7] and 221Th [8].

Nonzero octupole deformation was predicted in the ground
state of 223U (Z = 92) by macroscopic-microscopic model [9],
while the octupole-deformed minimum is not the lowest in
energy according to covariant density functional theory [10].
Experimental study of 223U will shed new light on the shape
evolution of N = 131 and 129 (α-decay daughter) isotones.

Isotope 223U was ﬁrst identiﬁed by the Dubna group at
the electrostatic separator VASSILISSA in the reaction of
208Pb(20Ne, 5n) [11]. Based on α-α correlation technique and
α−→ 215Ra
by searching for the decay chains of 223U
α−→ 211Rn, an α-particle energy of 8780(40) keV and a half-life
of 18+10
−5 µs were reported for 223U. The decay energy was
extracted by subtracting the known α-particle energy of 219Th
from the sum energy (full pile-up) of α decays of 223U and
its fast-decaying daughter 219Th (T1/2 = 1.05 µs) measured by

using traditional analog electronics.

In the present work, we report a new experimental study
of 223U using a fast digital pulse processing technique which
allows to clearly separate the fast sub-microsecond decays,
which was the main diﬃculty in the previous studies. Thanks to
the use of this method, ﬁne structure in the α decay of 223U was
observed for the ﬁrst time. Structural evolution in N = 129 and
131 isotones will be discussed in the framework of the reduced
α-decay width.

2. Experiment and results

The experiment was performed at

the gas-ﬁlled recoil
separator SHANS [12] at IMP (Lanzhou, China). Isotope 223U
was produced in the fusion-evaporation reaction 187Re(40Ar,
p3n) at a beam energy of 188 MeV with an average beam
intensity of 320 pnA in 110 hours. Targets of 187Re with a
thickness of 460 µg/cm2 were sputtered on 80 µg/cm2-thick
carbon foils, which were facing the beam. Evaporation residues
(ERs) were separated in-ﬂight from the beam particles and
implanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD)
with 48 horizontal and 128 vertical strips. The width of each
strip was ∼1 mm, while the separation distance between them
was ∼50 µm. Preampliﬁers with fast rising time (∼40 ns)
were used in the experiment. Noise was reduced by cooling
the preampliﬁers and DSSD with (-6 to -15 oC) alcohol and
improving the grounding of the DAQ system. Details about the
experimental setup can be found in Refs [13, 14].

In order to resolve short-lived products with lifetime ≤1
µs, a fast digital pulse processing technique was used in the
experiment. Preampliﬁed signals from each strip of DSSD
were recorded in 15 µs-long traces (including nearly 2.5 µs
baseline before the trigger point) with sampling frequency of
50 MHz [13]. Signals from the same strip with time diﬀerence
shorter than ∼12 µs will pile up and are stored in a single
trace. Amplitudes of pileup pulses were extracted by two
algorithms according to the time diﬀerences △T between them,
i.e., trapezoidal algorithm [15] for △T ≥ 0.5 µs and average
diﬀerence algorithm [13] for △T < 0.5 µs. Energy resolutions
(FWHM) of all the vertical strips summed up for double/triple
pileup events with time diﬀerences down to 0.5 µs and 0.2
µs were around 55 and 70 keV, respectively. For non-pileup
α-decay events, the energy resolution of DSSD was 22 keV.

quoted literature [16, 17]. Correlated implantation and α-decay
events were found in the same 1 × 1 mm2 pixel in DSSD. Due to
the short half-life of 219Th, α1 and α2 signals will pile up. The
digital pulse processing of the recorded traces allows to resolve
the two overlapping decay signals, to determine their energies
and the time diﬀerence between them. A two-dimensional
plot of α-α correlations is shown in Fig. 1, which includes
all possible pairs of correlated decays whether the third one
exists or not. The time window between recoil and α decay

is 200 ns ≤ ∆T (ER − α) ≤ 0.6 ms and that between any two α
decays is 200 ns ≤ ∆T (α − α) ≤ 20 ms, selected to highlight
the identiﬁcation of 223U. Another point in Fig. 1 is that α-α
correlations of 220Th-216Ra (produced in the αp2n evaporation
channel) resemble some of 223U in the α-particle energies.
In such case, 223U was distinguished from 220Th by the α
decay of the granddaughter 215Ra or by the half-lives of parent
(T1/2(223U) = 18 µs and T1/2(220Th) = 9.7 µs) and daughter
(T1/2(219Th) = 1.05 µs and T1/2(216Ra) = 182 ns) nuclei if the
third α particle escaped.

Besides the full-energy α decays of 223U and its daughter
products, some partial escapes of them were also included in the
analysis, as shown in the summary of measured decay chains
in Table 1. For partially escaping decays, the corresponding
energies can not be used, but their timing information is intact.
Thirty-four α-decay events were attributed to 223U. For eight
of them, only partial energies of α particles emitted from 223U
were recorded, but their daughters or granddaughters are full
energy decays.

The α spectra of isotopes 223U, 219Th and 215Ra identiﬁed
in these α-decay chains are shown in Fig. 2. Three α peaks at
8753(16), 8898(18) and 8993(17) keV are observed in 223U as
shown in Fig. 2 (a), with intensities of 46(15)%, 19(9)% and
35(13)%, respectively, where the errors are from the statistical
only. However, as will be shown below, some of these
intensities will need to be corrected for the possible eﬀect of
α + e− summing. One 8212 keV (in vertical strip of DSSD)
α-decay event of 223U was attributed to a crosstalk, because
a 8602 keV energy produced by the same event in horizontal
strip was recorded. Moreover, based on GEANT4 Monte Carlo
simulations, the 8212 keV event is very unlikely to result from
partially escaping 8753, 8898 and 8993 keV α particles, as
in the region of (8212 ± 70) keV only 0.03 event is expected
corresponding to the 26 full energy events of these three peaks.

literature values.

Half-lives for the 8753, 8898 and 8993 keV α peaks of 223U
were extracted to be 60+24
−20 µs, respectively,
by taking into account types of α1-α2-α3, α1-α2, α1-α3, and
α2-α3 correlations. Due to their very low statistics, the errors
of half-lives were calculated using the maximum likelihood
method described in Ref. [18]. These half-lives are consistent
within the error bars. So all these three α-decay groups are
assigned as originated from the ground-state decay of 223U,
feeding diﬀerent levels of 219Th. Combining all the thirty-four
events together, the half-life of 223U was determined to be 62+14
−10
µs, larger than the previous measurement [11]. The decay
scheme of 223U is shown in Fig. 3. To determine the excitation
energies of the populated levels in 219Th, Qα values of 223U
were calculated.

In the previous measurements of

223U using analog
electronics [11], a single α-decay branch at 8780 keV was
reported based only on the full-energy summing signals from
223U + 219Th decay. This α-particle energy seemed to be a
ground-state to ground-state transition as the evaluation in the

latest A = 223 Nuclear Data Sheets [17]. Our new results
suggest that the 8780 keV value most likely corresponds to
the strongest 8753 keV ground-state to 244 keV excited state
transition in this work.

A comment on the 8898 keV decay, which would establish
an excited state at 97 keV in 219Th, should be presented
here. We cannot exclude that this peak is due to the summing
of the 8753 keV α particle with the subsequent conversion
electron, originated from internal conversion of the 244 keV
γ-ray transition. Indeed, if α decay feeds a low-lying excited
state, which de-excites by a strongly converted γ-ray transition,
a well-known eﬀect of energy summing of α decay and
subsequent conversion electron can happen, if both α particle
and conversion electron are measured in the DSSD [19, 20].
This would lead to the appearance of ‘artiﬁcial’ summing α
lines in the spectra. The total conversion coeﬃcients of the 244
keV transition are: atot(M1) = 1.5, atot(E1) = 0.06 and atot(E2)
= 0.33 [21]. Therefore, in case of E1 or E2 multipolarity,
the conversion of the 244 keV transition is negligible, thus no
α(8753 keV) + e− summing can be observed, and the 8898 keV
will be a real α peak. For M1 the K-conversion is dominant
(aK(M1) = 1.19), resulting in K-electron energy of 134 keV.
The α(8753 keV) + e−(134 keV) summing would indeed give
rise to a summing peak around 8887 keV, close to the observed
peak at 8898 keV.

Based on the GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations for α +
e− summing in DSSD (see Fig. 4), we estimated that the
whole ∼8898 keV decay can be explained as an artiﬁcial
peak being due to α(8753 keV) + e− summing of the 134
keV conversion electron from the 244 keV transition if it is
of pure M1 multipolarity.
In the simulation, ratio between
source intensities of electron and α particle was set to be
0.54, deﬁned by the conversion coeﬃcient aK(M1) = 1.19. A
relative intensity of 26% between α + e− peak and pure α peak
was obtained, which is nearly consistent with the experimental
result 41(24)%. So there seems no level at 97 keV in 219Th
and the intensity of the 8753 keV α decay should be 65(20)%1,
where the reported error is statistical only, see Table 1. We will
return to this issue in the Discussion section. Moreover, since
the known lowest excited states of N = 129 isotones 215Rn and

1The earlier extracted half-life of 223U should not be aﬀected by the

conversion-electron process, which is assumed to be comparatively short.

217Ra are above 200 keV, the 97 keV excited state of 223U seems

3. Discussion

To understand the observed ﬁne structure decays of 223U, we
also show the α-decay schemes of N = 131 isotones 219Ra and
221Th in Fig. 3. These two isotones are located at the edge
of the region where octupole deformation was predicted [9].
A 7/2+ ground state was reproduced for each of 219Ra and
221Th by reﬂection-asymmetric rotor model [6] at β2 = β3 =
0.1 deformation.

Spins and parities have been tentatively assigned to the
populated excited states in 215Rn [17] and 217Ra [22]. Even
though (7/2)+ and (11/2+) are assigned to the 315 keV level
in 215Rn and 333 keV level in 217Ra, respectively, both spins
are possible for each of them. The possible spins of the 315
keV state in 215Rn are (7/2, 11/2)+ according to the measured γ
transition mode [23, 24], the same applies for the 333 keV state
in 217Ra. Decays to these two levels are weakly hindered with

4

HF < 5, implying similar conﬁguration between initial and ﬁnal
states. The (7/2+) and (11/2+) assignments were interpreted to
be of octupole conﬁguration in the reﬂection-asymmetric rotor
model, while in the shell model framework they were supposed
to be originated from the same conﬁguration νg2
9/2i11/2 [25].
Branches feeding the spherical 9/2+ ground states of 215Rn
and 217Ra were strongly hindered with HF = 90 and 53,
respectively, echoing the non-spherical octupole conﬁguration
of the ground states in 219Ra and 221Th.

In the α decay of 223U, the 8753 keV transition feeding
the 244 keV (‘apparent intensity’ Iα = 46%) level in 219Th
is unhindered and shows hindrance factor of 2.2. In case the
8898 keV peak is due to α + e− summing, as proposed in the
previous section, the intensity of 8753 keV decay increases to
65%, leading to HF(8753 keV) = 1.6. We use this intensity
value in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Thus in either scenario (with or
without α + e− summing), the 8753 keV decay is unhindered.
The 8993 keV ground-state to ground-state transition of 223U
is hindered with HF = 12. Based on these HF values, spin of
the ground state of 223U should be the same as that of the 244
keV excited state of 219Th, while is diﬀerent from the (9/2+)
ground state of 219Th. Based on the intensities and hindrance
factors, (7/2+) and (7/2+, 11/2+) are tentatively assigned to the
ground state of 223U and the 244 keV excited state of 219Th by
following the systematics, respectively. These assignments are
also beneﬁcial to the discussion of the evolution of systematics.
In the in-beam γ spectroscopy of 219Th [26], a 362 keV
level with a tentative assignment of Jπ = (11/2+) was thought
to correspond to the (11/2+) level at 333 keV in 217Ra. This
level was observed in both α decay and in-beam γ spectroscopy,
while the 362 keV level in 219Th was observed only in the
in-beam γ spectroscopy. Because fusion-evaporation reactions
like that in Ref. [26] are tend to populate near-yrast levels
whereas the α-decay don’t, it is possible both the 362 and 244
keV levels exist in 219Th. Another possible explanation is the
onset of structure change in the ground state of 223U.

The mass of 223U was deduced from the ground-state to
ground-state Qα obtained in the present work. In Fig. 5, the
experimental masses of N = 131 isotones up to 223U were

For the ﬁrst two N = 131 isotones, 215Po and 217Rn (see
Fig. 6 (a)), the ground-state to ground-state decays proceed
between the νg9/2 conﬁgurations with δ2 values of ∼100 keV,
in agreement with the very similar spherical structures between
parent and daughter nuclei. From Z = 88 on, ﬁne structure
with competing branches appear and the reduced widths for the
ground-state to ground-state transitions drop suddenly. Decays
of 219Ra and 221Th show strong hindrance with δ2 ∼ 5 keV,
indicating very diﬀerent structure between the ground states of
parent and daughter nuclei. New δ2 value for the ground-state
to ground-state transition of 223U continues the rising trend in
219Ra and 221Th, but still shows hindrance with δ2 = 25 keV. If
other assignment rather than (7/2+) to the ground state of 223U is
used, the rising trend can not be changed. A reverse movement
is revealed in the hindrance factors.

The rising trend of

reduced α-decay width for

the
ground-state transitions of N = 131 isotones from Z = 88 to
92, combining with the behavior of nuclear masses in Fig. 5,
may indicate a weakening octupole deformation in the ground
state of 223U.

The δ2 values for the most dominant branch with possible
assignments of (7/2+,11/2+) are shown in Fig. 6 (a), the relative
large values imply that octupole correlations are developing
in the excited levels of the N = 129 daughter nuclei. This
is in agreement with the evidences of octupole deformation
in the in-beam γ-spectroscopy studies of 217Ra [30, 31] and
219Th [26].

4. Summary and outlook

Figure 6: Reduced α-decay widths (δ2) for the N = 131 (a) and 129 (b) isotones
with even Z between 84 and 92. The δ2 values extracted from the new α-decay
data of 223U are shown with full symbols, the errors are mainly from the relative
intensities.

compared with two versions of theoretical calculations, one
taking into account the octupole correlations [9] while another
not [27]. For 219Ra(Z = 88) and heavier isotones, the theoretical
masses with octupole correlations around β3 = -0.134 [9]
become favorable and reproduce the experimental data better,
suggesting the onset of octupole deformation at Z = 88. Until
to Z = 92, both models do equally poor job for 223U, the
weakening of octupole deformation is implied.

To understand the evolution of nuclear structure, reduced
α-decay width (δ2) is used. It can probe the overlap between
the wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal states of α decay. It
is calculated using the relation λ = δ2P/h [28, 29], where λ is
the measured partial decay constant, h is the Planck’s constant
and P is the penetration probability of α particle with angular
momentum L through the Coulomb and centrifugal barriers.
The reduced α-decay widths for N = 131 and 129 isotones are
shown Fig. 6. No obvious ﬁne structure are observed in the α
decays of the N = 129 isotones and their reduced widths remain
nearly constant around 80 keV, reﬂecting similar spherical νg9/2
conﬁgurations in the ground states of N = 129 parents and N =
127 daughters.

Two α-decay branches of 223U feeding the ground state and
244 keV excited state of 219Th are reported. An α-particle
energy of 8993 keV and a half-life of 62+14
−10 µs are assigned to
the ground-state decay of 223U. Evolution of nuclear structure
for N = 131 isotones is discussed in terms of nuclear mass and
reduced α-decay width, structure in the ground state of 223U
may go through a weakening octupole deformation relative to
its lighter isotones 219Ra and 221Th.
