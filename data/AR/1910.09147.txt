ABSTRACT

Using the Hα data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) at the Fuxian Solar Observatory together with
multi-wavelength images and magnetograms obtained by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we study the detailed
process of three homologous conﬁned ﬂares in active-region (AR) NOAA 11861 on 2013 October 12. All of the three
ﬂares occurred at same location, with similar morphologies and comparable class. Through analyzing the evolution
of magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂow ﬁeld, we found an emergence of magnetic ﬂux and a strong shearing motion between two
opposite polarities near the following sunspot. The magnetic ﬂux and the average transverse ﬁeld strength exhibited a
decrease before each eruption and reached the lowest point at the onset of each eruption. By calculating the shearing
and the emergence energy in the photosphere, we found that the integral of energy injected from the photosphere, for
a few hours, could provide enough energy for the ﬂares. The reconnection between diﬀerent loops was observed in Hα
images during the occurrence of each ﬂare. These results suggest that the emerging magnetic ﬂux and the shearing
motion in the photosphere can inject the energy to the sheared magnetic loops and the energy ﬁnally was released via
magnetic reconnection to power the solar ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are thought to be one of the violent energetic events that are involving in the sudden release of magnetic
energy stored in active region (AR), which can be transformed into the kinetic of particles and heating energy. Some
ﬂares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which eject large amount of magnetic structures into
interplanetary space (Harrison 1995) and are known as eruptive ﬂares. However, some ﬂares are not associated with
CMEs, which are called as conﬁned ﬂares (Svestka & Cliver 1992; Guo et al. 2010; Zheng et al. 2012). The eruptive
ﬂares tend to be large intensity and long duration event (Kahler et al. 1989; Andrews 2003). The investigations
revealed that the eruptions are greatly determined by surrounding magnetic structures. Break-out model to explain
eruptive events is that, the overlying magnetic loops should exist an opening process (Antiochos et al. 1999; Lin et
al. 2003; Forbes et al. 2006). The torus instability plays an important role in solar eruptions. If the decay index of
overlying magnetic ﬁeld strength with height is lower than 1.5, the solar eruption will be conﬁned (Kliem & T¨or¨ok
2006; Fan & Gibson 2007). Chen et al. (2013) and Yang et al. (2014) found that overlying arcade loops can prevent
ﬁlament being eruptive.

Studies on the trigger mechanisms of solar ﬂares are quite important in predicting the occurrence of ﬂares. The ﬂares
with a similar origin within the AR and common spatial and temporal characters can be implied as homologous ﬂares
(Zhang & Wang 2002; Sui et al. 2004; Gary & Moore 2004; Goﬀ et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2016). To explain
the triggering of solar ﬂares, several theories have been proposed by many researchers. In magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) models, solar ﬂares can be triggered by MHD instabilities, e.g., kink instability (Hood & Priest 1979; T¨or¨ok
& Kliem 2005). As the studies of Green et al. (2018), the torus instability, as an ideal MHD instability, is responsible
for the acceleration of the ejecta and considered as a driving mechanisms in solar eruptions(Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006;
D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010). Using data-driven simulation, Jiang et al. (2016) suggest that eruption can be triggered
by jet-like reconnection. Magnetic cancellation is also an major trigger mechanism for solar ﬂares (Livi et al. 1989;
Green et al. 2011). Sigmoidal ﬂux ropes can be built by photospheric ﬂux cancellation and accumulated enough stress
that make magnetic structure to erupt (Savcheva et al. 2012). Some researches suggest that the pre-ﬂare activities
may be a result of slow reconnection (Kim et al. 2001). The pre-ﬂare activities caused by magnetic reconnection play
a crucial role in destabilizing the magnetic ﬁeld, leading to a solar eruptive ﬂare and associated large-scale phenomena
(Joshi et al. 2011). Reconnection of a strongly sheared ﬁeld below the magnetic arcades can trigger solar eruptions,
which correspond to the tether-cutting scenario (Moore et al. 2012).

Solar ﬂares are also associated with the rapid rotation of sunspots (Zhang et al. 2007; Yan et al. 2009; Li & Zhang
2009; Min & Chae 2009; Yan et al. 2012; T¨or¨ok et al. 2013). The sunspot motions help in the building up of magnetic
shear at many locations of the action region. The rotation direction of sunspots opposite to the diﬀerential rotation of
the sun have higher X-class ﬂare production (Yan et al. 2008). Further study of rotating sunspots, Yan et al. (2008)
and Jiang et al. (2012) ravel that active region’s production rate of ﬂares is related to the rotating sunspots. Recently,
the investigations show that shearing motion and sunspots rotation play an import role in buildup of free energy and
the formation of ﬂux ropes (Yan et al. 2018). Besides, the new emergence of magnetic ﬂux can cause the destabilization
of sheared ﬁelds and eventually leading to eruption (Choudhary et al. 1998).

As is well known, magnetic energy consists of both the potential energy and free energy. The higher ratio of free
energy to potential energy of active regions can make the ﬁeld become less stable that the magnetic ﬁeld will be capable
of being triggered to explode when the ratio getting the crucial point (Moore et al. 2012). It has been thought that
free energy stored in active regions can be as a result of twist or shear of magnetic ﬁeld near the polarity inversion
lines(PIL) (Falconer et al. 2008; Moore et al. 2012). A strong gradient of magnetic ﬁeld with highly sheared coronal
ﬁeld likely produces solar ﬂares (Martres et al. 1968; Hagyard et al. 1990; Wang 2006). Some researches show that the
free energy is initial from emergence magnetic ﬁeld, and later the shearing ﬂows build up much of it (Liu & Schuck
2012). The emergence of new ﬂux at the onset of ﬂare has suﬃcient energy to power ﬂares and makes the magnetic
ﬁeld become a more sheared conﬁguration (Verma 2018). Meanwhile, fast rotation of sunspot and shearing motions
can store suﬃcient energy to account for solar ﬂares (Kazachenko et al. 2009, 2010). By calculating the free energy of
magnetic ﬁeld, Aschwanden (2015) found a decreasing of free energy after ﬂares. Magnetic energy can be transported
from the solar interior to the corona by the photospheric motions (Berger & Field 1984; Wang 1996; D´emoulin &
Berger 2003). The horizontal motion transfers the magnetic energy from the photosphere to upper atmosphere, while
the vertical motion carries the energy from below the photosphere(Kusano et al. 2002). The magnetic energy ﬂux

transportation across the photosphere can be deﬁned as follows (Kusano et al. 2002; Liu & Schuck 2012):

Where Bt and Bn refer to the horizontal and vertical components of magnetic ﬁeld, V⊥ t and V⊥ n denote the horizontal
and vertical components, with respect to the photosphere, of the plasma velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.
The ﬁrst and the second terms are caused by the vertical motion through the photosphere and horizontal motion in
the photosphere, respectively, which means the energy ﬂux across photosphere generated by the emergence of twisted
magnetic tube from solar interior and the shearing motion on surface.

To study the energy origination of solar ﬂares, a series of conﬁned ﬂares occurring in AR NOAA 11861 were
investigated in detail in this paper. These events were ﬁrst studied by Yang et al. (2014). Their researches found
that the overlying loops help to prevent the ﬂares being eruptive and the emerging loops interact with pre-existing
In this paper, we present more detail research to show the
loops cause the reconnection that triggered the ﬂares.
evidence of ﬂux emergence and shearing motion in photosphere. What is more, we calculate the energy ﬂux across
the photosphere, containing shearing and emergence energy, and try to ﬁnd out that whether the energy of the ﬂares
can be accumulated by the emergence of ﬂux and shearing motion in the photosphere. The detail observations are
presented in Section 2. The results are shown in Section 3. We discuss and make a conclusion in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS

The New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) is one meter vacuum solar telescope that locates in the southwest of
China, and aims to observe the ﬁne structures in both the photosphere and the chromosphere (Liu et al. 2014). It
has three imaging channels, which consists of one chromospheric channel and two photospheric channels. The band
for observing the chromosphere is Hα (6562.8 ˚A) with a bandwidth of 0.25 ˚A. The NVST data that we adopted in
this paper were Hα center images, from 01:01:32 UT to 08:00:02 UT on 2013 October 12 with a cadence of 12 s and a
ﬁeld-of-view of (FOV) 152(cid:48)(cid:48)×152(cid:48)(cid:48) with a pixel size of 0.164(cid:48)(cid:48). Meanwhile, the simultaneous SDO/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly(AIA) (Lemen et al. 2012) multi-band images are also used. The 304, 171, 131, 1600 ˚A images, with a pixel
size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48), are employed to show the eruption process of the three conﬁned ﬂares. To identify the ﬂares better, the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data are also used to show the variation of soft X-ray ﬂux.
According to GOES X-ray data, three ﬂares occurred at around 01:58 UT, 04:05 UT, 06:32 UT, respectively. We set
the reference time at 01:00 UT. The images from all of the three AIA channels were prepared to Level 1.5 and also
co-aligned to the reference time by using the standard procedure in SSW. The LOS magnetograms with 45 s cadence,
obtained by SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the SDO from 2013 October 11 to 12, were used
to show the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld. The vector magnetograms observed by HMI (Schou et al. 2012; Bobra et al.
2014; Centeno et al. 2014; Bobra et al. 2014) are employed to show the evolution of vertical and horizontal magnetic
ﬁelds. These magnetograms from the Space Weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) series have a cadence of
12 minutes and a pixel scale of about 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48). The vector ﬁeld data are derived by using the Very Fast Inversion of the
Stokes Vector algorithm (Borrero et al. 2011). Meanwhile, the minimum energy method (Metcalf 1994; Metcalf et al.
2006; Leka et al. 2009) is used to resolve the 180 ◦ azimuthal ambiguity.

3. RESULTS

AR NOAA 11861 ﬁrst appeared at the east limb of solar surface on 2013 October 8, and was closing to the central
meridian on 2013 October 12 with a type of βγδ sunspot group. Figure 1 shows the images of three eruptions at 131 ˚A
(panels (a1)-(a3)), 171 ˚A images (panels (b1)-(b3)), and 304 ˚A images (panels (c1)-(c3)), observed by SDO/AIA. The
general appearances of ﬂares in Hα images are shown in panels (d1)-(d3). The three ﬂares occurred at around 01:58
UT, 04:05 UT and 06:32 UT (see panels (d1)-(d3)), respectively. It’s obvious that, these eruptions occurred at the same
location, with similar morphologies and comparable class (C5.2, C4.9, and C2.0). A sequences of ﬂares, occurring in a
sustaining magnetic structure with common spatial and temporal characters can be implied as homologous ﬂares and
tend have similar trigger mechanisms (Zhang & Wang 2002; Chen et al. 2015). During these process, dark materials
were seen to be ejected into solar atmosphere and fell back to solar surface along a large arcade (see the online
animation associated with Figure 1). In the previous studies of Yang et al. (2014), the time-distance diagram shows
the overlying loops lifted at ﬁrst as the ﬂare expanded, and then stopped at a certain height when the ﬂare began
to decay. Moreover, 171 ˚A images show the coronal loops maintained their initial conﬁguration without signiﬁcant

images at the onset stage of the three conﬁned ﬂares. Panels (g)-(i) show the LOS magnetogram at the initial stage of the

change. According to the coronagraph images of SOHO/LASCO C2, there were no signatures of successfully-ejected
material associated with these ﬂares. Therefore, these ﬂares can be called homologous conﬁned ﬂares.

Previous studies show that, the sites of pre-ﬂare brightening with respect to the location of ﬂux rope/ﬁlament is
essential to understand the triggering process of solar eruptions. Figure 2 shows the evolution of active region in
1600, 171 ˚A images and LOS magnetograms. Panels (a)-(f) present the onset stage of the three eruptions acquired in
1600 ˚A and 171 ˚A. Panels (g)-(i) show the LOS magnetograms at the initial stage of three ﬂares. The red and blue
contours indicate the sites of pre-ﬂare brightening in 1600 ˚A and 171 ˚A images respectively. The white and the black
colors in the LOS magnetograms refer to the positive and the negative magnetic polarities, respectively. The 1600 ˚A
images indicate the locations of these ﬂares. As shown in panels (a)-(c) and LOS magnetograms (panels (g)-(i)), all
of the three ﬂares located in the blue box. The position of the emerging ﬂux is a crucial factor in the interaction of
the background magnetic ﬁeld and the resulting evolution (Dacie et al. 2018). Flux emergence near a pre-existing,
current-carrying magnetic structure is thought to be one possible mechanism for the initiation of eruption (Chen &
Shibata 2000). To present the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld in the blue box, shown in Figure 2, detail structure of

Figure 5. Topology evolution acquired at Hα images. Panels (a1)-(a3) and (b1)-(b3) display the process of the ﬁrst, the
second and the third ﬂares obtained from Hα data, respectively. Panels (c1)-(c3) and (d1)-(d3) refer to the evolution of LOS
magnetograms, with the positive ﬁeld outlined by blue curves and negative ﬁeld by red. Black curves L1-L12 represent the
visible loops identiﬁed in Hα images. The green cross symbols in panel(c1)-(c3) mark the site where the reconnection occurred.
An animation of the Hα images is available in the online Journal. The animation runs from 01 : 32 to 08 : 00 UT and is
annotated with the locations of the 12 loops and the reconnection.

As is shown in Figure 3, the areas of positive ﬁeld in black box (A1), outlined by the blue curves and denoted by
the blue arrow, were growing with time. There was almost not positive polarity in A2, as shown in panel (a). Next,
it emerged rapidly (see panel (b)). This suggests that ﬂux emergence existed within A1 and A2. There were several
companied C-class ﬂares occurred, with the emergence of ﬂux in A1 and A2 from 15:00 UT on October 11 to 00:46
UT on October 12. It’s no doubt that the ﬂux emergence plays an critical role in the occurrence of these ﬂares. The
temporal proﬁles of positive magnetic ﬂux, from 00:00 UT to 07:00 UT on 2013 October 12, are shown in Figure 4.
Black and blue curves refer to the positive magnetic ﬂux in the area outlined by the black box (A1) and the blue box
(A2) in Figure 3, respectively. It’s obvious that, positive magnetic ﬂux in A1 increased from 00:00 UT to 06:00 UT.
We found some interesting results that, the positive magnetic ﬂux in A2 decreased before each ﬂare and reach the
lowest point at the onset of eruption and increased after each ﬂare. This phenomenon implies that there may exist a
process of ﬂux cancelation within A2 caused by magnetic reconnection.

To study the reconnection process, we use the Hα images to get the ﬁne structure of loops and its evolution process.
As the previous studies of Yang et al. (2014), magnetic reconnection took place between diﬀerent loops, according to
the observations of NVST. Figure 5 displays the evolution process of the three ﬂares both in Hα images and LOS
magnetograms. At the pre-ﬂare stage (panels (a1)-(a3)), many arch-shaped Hα ﬁbrils can be clearly observed, as
delineated with curves L1, L2 (panel (a1)) and L5, L6 (panel (a2)) and L9, L10 (panel (a3)). A few minutes after the
onset of solar ﬂares, new loops L3, L4, L7, L8, L11 and L12 were formed (see panels (b1)-(b3)). As shown in LOS
magnetograms (panels (c1)-(c3) and (d1)-(d4)), the arch-shaped Hα ﬁbrils, delineated in black curves, connect the
positive polarity and the nearby negative ﬁelds. The magnetic reconnection took place between loops L1 and L2 at
the site marked by the green cross symbol (see panel (c1)). Similar process took place between loops L5 and L6 (see

panel (c2)) and between L9 and L10 (see panel (c3)). Due to the reconnection, loops L3, L4, L7, L8, L11, L12 were
newly formed, as indicated by the black curves in panels (d1)-(d3).

The evolution of vector magnetograms of our focus areas, outlined by blue box in Figure 2, are shown in Figure 6.
The red and the blue arrows in left panels (a1), (a2) and (a3) are referred to transverse magnetic ﬁelds of positive
polarity and negative polarity, respectively. The magnetic ﬁelds between positive polarity and negative polarity show
a strong shear angle along polarity inversion line (PIL), which means that the magnetic ﬁelds had a strong departure
from potential ﬁeld before each eruption. The green arrows in right panels (b1), (b2) and (b3) are referred to the
direction of transverse ﬂow ﬁeld calculated by the diﬀerential aﬃne velocity estimator (DAVE) method. It’s obvious
that the positive polarity (S1) and the negative polarity (S2) were moving away from each other, which denotes that
there existed a shearing motion between S1 and S2.

To further understand the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld, we calculate the average transverse ﬁeld strength and the
average ﬂow velocity of the region outlined by the blue box that shown in Figure 2. We also calculate the energy
ﬂux across the photosphere in the same region outlined by the blue box shown in Figure 2, to determine how much

accumulated energy of the eruptions are injected. The top panel of Figure 7 refers to the temporal proﬁles of average
ﬂow velocity (red curve) and average transverse ﬁeld strength (blue curve). At the peak time of the ﬁrst ﬂare, 01:58
UT, the average transverse ﬁeld strength is 529.6 G. It became 537.3 G at 03:00 UT, 523.3 G at 04:12 UT, and 529.9
G at 05:12 UT. One can see that the average transverse ﬁeld strength decreased before each ﬂare and had a small
increasing after eruption, like the temporal evolution of magnetic ﬂux of A2. But the overall proﬁle of the average
transverse ﬁeld strength is decreasing during our calculate duration. Due to the noisy data of average ﬂow velocity,
we make an average value within a period of time. The green solid lines refer to the average velocity from 00:00 UT to
02:00 UT. The brown solid lines refer to the average velocity from 02:00 UT to 04:05 UT. The black solid lines refer
to the average velocity from 04:00 UT to 06:35 UT. The pink solid lines refer to the average velocity from 06:35 UT
to 12:05 UT. The average velocity from 02:00 UT to 04:05 UT and 04:35 UT to 06:35 UT are about 0.279 km/s and
0.282 km/s, respectively, while the average velocities from 00:00 UT to 02:00 UT and 06:35 UT to 12:05 UT are all
about 0.269 km/s. It turns out that the ﬂow velocity is a little faster during the period of three ﬂares, from 02:00 UT
to 06:35 UT. The shearing energy ﬂux (black), emergence energy ﬂux (green) and total energy ﬂux (blue) are shown
in middle panel. As with the average ﬂow velocity, we make an average value within a period of time. The green
solid lines refer to the average total energy ﬂux from 00:00 UT to 02:00 UT. The brown solid lines refer to the average
total energy ﬂux from 02:00 UT to 04:05 UT. The black solid lines refer to the average total energy ﬂux from 04:00
UT to 06:35 UT. The pink solid lines refer to the average total energy ﬂux from 06:35 UT to 12:05 UT. The average
total energy ﬂux is 2.48 × 1024 ergs/s from 00:00 UT to 02:00 UT, 4.54 × 1024 ergs/s from 02:00 UT to 04:05, 4.76
× 1024 ergs/s from 04:00 UT to 06:35 UT, and 3.66 × 1024 ergs/s from 06:35 UT to 12:05 UT. As the evolution of
the average ﬂow velocity, the average total energy ﬂux is more larger during the period of three ﬂares, from 02:00
UT to 06:35 UT. The integral of the energy ﬂux over time are show in the bottom panel, with shearing energy in
black and emergence energy in green. The blue curve is the summation of the two terms. GOES X-ray ﬂux 1.0-8.0
˚A (pink), shown in bottom panel, are used to determine the eruption time and class of the three ﬂares. Both of the
energy ﬂuxes evolved consistently in phase and the emergence energy ﬂux was dominant, contributing much to the
total energy. Total energy accumulated from 02:00 UT to 04:05 UT is about 0.34 × 1029 ergs, which is comparable
to the energy accumulated from 04:05 UT to 06:35 UT (0.43 × 1029 ergs). The integral of energy is around 1029 ergs
and comparable with a C-class ﬂare.

4. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

Active region NOAA 11861 produced three conﬁned ﬂares from 02:00 UT to 06:35 UT on 2014 October 12. All of
the three ﬂares occurred at a same location, had a similar morphologies, and a comparable classes (C5.2, C4.9, and
C2.0). Thus, these ﬂares can be implied as homologous ﬂares, which may have an analogous trigger mechanisms.

During the evolution of active region, the magnetic emergence and cancellation were found before and during three
ﬂares. According to the temporal proﬁle of positive magnetic ﬂux, a continue process of ﬂux emergence happened in
region A1. In the studies of Zhang & Wang (2002), the continuous emergence of moving magnetic features trigger the
homologous ﬂares. Moreover, the positive magnetic ﬂux of A2 decreased before each of the ﬂares and reached the lowest
point around the onset of the eruptions and then increased. Previous investigations found that magnetic ﬂux tends to
decrease during ﬂares rather than increase (Burtseva & Petrie 2013). Our results found that magnetic ﬂux decreased
before these ﬂares and became the smallest around the onset of the eruptions. By carefully examining the evolution
of magnetic ﬁelds, it is found that ﬂux emergence ﬁrst occurred before the ﬂares and then ﬂux cancelation is followed
in the region A2. Many models have added the ﬂux emergence into a pre-existing magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration to
explain the eruptions (Zuccarello et al. 2008, 2009; Jacobs & Poedts 2012; Kusano et al. 2012; Roussev et al. 2012). It
suggests that the emergence of new magnetic ﬂux plays an important role in the onset of ﬂares. Magnetic reconnection
occurs between the new magnetic loops that emergence from below photosphere and the pre-existing overlying ﬁeld.
Magnetic reconnection in destabilizing the magnetic conﬁguration is considered as a possible mechanism to trigger
solar eruptions (Vrˇsnak 2008). We can deduce that the existence of ﬂux emergence may be crucial in triggering the
sequential conﬁned ﬂares. In these events, it implies that the reconnection took place between a set of loops, according
to the Hα images observed by NVST (Yang et al. 2014).

As revealed in previous observations, horizontal shear ﬂows are responsible for magnetic stress and driver for magnetic
reconnection (Yurchyshyn et al. 2006). The transverse magnetic ﬁelds and the velocity maps, calculated by using the
DAVE method, show that there had a strong shear angle along PIL and shear ﬂow between the polarities S1 and
S2 before each of eruption. The temporal evolution of velocity maps show that there was a faster velocity during

11

the period of these ﬂares, from 02:00 UT to 06:35UT. Analysis shows that average transverse ﬁeld strength decreased
before the onset of each ﬂare and exhibited a small increasing after each ﬂare. The decreasing of the average transverse
ﬁeld strength and magnetic ﬂux of A2 calculated from LOS magnetograms before the ﬂares suggest that the magnetic
cancellation, as a result of reconnection, could be going on before the ﬂares.

Since the shearing motion and ﬂux emergence can drive magnetic reconnection, the evidence of magnetic reconnection
between diﬀerent loops was also found in Hα images. The three ﬂares were all triggered by magnetic reconnection
between two groups of loops. By calculating the free energy associated with ﬂares, a signiﬁcant drop of free energy
was found after ﬂare(Jing et al. 2009). The energy across the photosphere was calculated in previous studies. Liu
& Schuck (2012) found the source of energy injection is the areas with strong up-ﬂows in the surrounding of leading
sunspot. Bi et al. (2018) found the energy ﬂux across the sunspot was negative during the ﬂare and positive before
the ﬂare. However, whether the energy across the photosphere can support to a speciﬁc ﬂare is not sure. We calculate
the energy ﬂux in the area, where the three ﬂares occurred. As the studies of Liu & Schuck (2012), the shearing and
the emergence ﬂuxes evolved consistently in phase, while the emergence ﬂux contribute much of the energy. The total
energy ﬂux seems much larger before the end of last ﬂare. Furthermore, the energy accumulated by shearing and
vertical motion in the photosphere, from 00:00 UT to 06:35 UT, was enough to support the energy of eruptions. Note
that, the accumulated energy could not totally been released during the ﬂares. Moreover, since free energy may be
already stored in magnetic ﬁeld before the occurrence of the ﬁrst ﬂare. Therefore the energy accumulated by shearing
and vertical motion in the photosphere may provide partial energy of these ﬂares. Meanwhile, the shearing motion
and ﬂux emergence drive the magnetic reconnection between the diﬀerent loops to destabilize the topology of magnetic
structure and ﬁnally trigged these eruptions.
