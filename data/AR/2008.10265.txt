Abstract A sample of isolated Earth-impacting interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) that occurred
in the period January 2008 to August 2014 is analysed in order to study in detail the ICME in situ signatures
with respect to the type of filament eruption related to the corresponding CME. Observations from different
vantage points provided by SOHO, STEREO-A and STEREO–B are used to determine for each CME under
study whether it is Earth directed or not. For Earth-directed CMEs, a kinematical study was performed using
the STEREO-A,B COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs and the Heliospheric Imagers HI1, to estimate the CME
arrival time at 1 AU and to link the CMEs with the corresponding in situ solar wind counterparts. Based on
the extrapolated CME kinematics, we identified interacting CMEs, which were excluded from further
analysis. Applying this approach, a set of 31 isolated Earth–impacting CMEs was unambiguously identified
and related to the in situ measurements recorded by the Wind spacecraft. We classified the events into
subsets with respect to the CME source location as well as with respect to the type of the associated filament
eruption. Hence, the events are divided into three subsamples: active region (AR) CMEs, disappearing
filament (DSF) CMEs, and stealthy CMEs. The related three groups of ICMEs were further divided into two
subsets: magnetic obstacle (MO) events (out of which four were stealthy), covering ICMEs that at least
partly expose characteristics of flux ropes, and ejecta (EJ) events, not showing such characteristics. In this
way, 14 MO-ICMEs and 17 EJ-ICMES were identified. The solar source regions of the non-stealthy
MO-ICMEs are found to be located predominantly (9/10; 90%) within ±30° from the solar central meridian,
whereas EJ-ICMEs originate predominantly (16/17; 94%) from source regions that are outside ±30°. In the
next step, MO-events were analysed in more detail, considering the magnetic field strengths and the plasma
characteristics in three different segments of the ICMEs, defined as the turbulent sheath (TS), the frontal
region (FR), and the MO itself. The analysis revealed various well-defined correlations for AR, DSF, and
the
stealthy ICMEs, which we interpreted considering basic physical concepts. Our results support
hypothesis that ICMEs show different signatures depending on the in situ spacecraft trajectory, in terms of
apex versus flank hits.

1. Introduction

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are dynamical events in which plasma and unstable magnetic field structure
are ejected from the solar corona into interplanetary space (e.g., Gopalswamy, 2004). When CMEs arrive at
Earth, they are detected in situ as interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). On their route through the heliosphere,

ICMEs can interact with high speed solar wind streams or other
magneto-plasmatic structures.

ICMEs,

forming complex

Current knowledge of the propagation, evolution and morphology of CMEs/ICMEs has been obtained
from white light coronagraph images and in situ data (e.g., Hundhausen et al., 1984; Lepping et al., 1995;
Ogilivie et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1998; McComas et al., 1998; Vourlidas et al., 2010; for a recent review
see Manchester et al., 2017). Remote-sensing observations of CMEs by coronagraphs such as the Large
Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) and coronagraphs and Heliospheric Imagers of the Sun–Earth Connection Coronal and
Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) (Howard et al., 2008) onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO) enabled imaging of CMEs from their liftoff in the lower corona up to the distance of
Earth and beyond, providing insights into the CME/ICME morphology and kinematics close to the Sun as
well as in the interplanetary space. Soon after the discovery of CMEs, the connection between white-light
CMEs and in situ disturbances was recognized (e.g., Sheeley et al., 1980). Linking the remote CME
observations with the structure of their in situ counterparts is not a straightforward task. First, because white
light images of CMEs present only a projected view and line-of-sight integrated emission of an optically thin
plasma structure, whereas the in situ solar wind (SW) measurements provide only local characteristics as the
spacecraft passes through a large-scale ICME structure. In addition, the correct pairing of a CME imaged
close to the Sun and an in situ observed ICME is often very difficult, especially in periods of high activity
due to multiple CMEs launched in close succession.

Generally, it is assumed that all CMEs should have a flux rope structure, but in situ measurements
indicate that on average only one-third of the identified CMEs show a clear flux rope signature, i.e., only
about one third of ICMEs are so-called magnetic clouds (e.g., Gosling, 1990; Nakwacki et al., 2011; Howard
and DeForest et al., 2012), representing magneto-plasma structures with increased, smoothly rotating
magnetic field (Burlaga et al., 1981; Zurbuchen & Richardson, 2006; Kilpua et al., 2017, and references
therein). However, there is no specific solar wind (SW) signature which unambiguously represents all
ICMEs. Rather, we observe a subset of signatures in which some characteristics may appear and disappear
during the passage of an ICME (Gosling, 1990).

Considering in situ signatures at 1 AU (Burlaga et al. 1981), ICMEs can be classified into two subsets:
magnetic clouds (MC) and ejecta (EJ). According to Burlaga et al. (1981), MCs are well structured ICMEs,
which have a magnetic field magnitude higher than average and are characterized by low magnetic field
variance and smoothly rotating direction during the passage of the ICME over the in situ spacecraft
(indicative of a flux rope), as well as by low proton temperature and low plasma-, i.e. low gas-to-magnetic
pressure ratio (Klein and Burlaga, 1981). When a smoothly rotating magnetic field is not observed, such an
ICME is classified as an EJ (Burlaga et al., 2001). However, many ICMEs contain partially an MC and
partially complex structures, which could be a result of the passage of an ICME far from its apex, or a
distortion of the ICME internal magnetic structure during its interplanetary evolution (see e.g. Jian et al.,
2006; Richardson & Cane, 2010; Kilpua et al., 2017; Manchester et al., 2017 and references therein).
According to Jian et al. (2006) and more recent work of Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2018, 2019), the MC
definition can be extended by introducing the concept of a magnetic obstacle (MO), where MO
configurations are not always defined by a full single magnetic field rotation and do not necessarily show a
MC configuration throughout the structure. Therefore, the MO concept includes also events with MC-like
signatures (as defined by Roulliard, 2011), as well as complex structures.

The origin of CMEs on the Sun is associated with various eruptive and dynamical phenomena in the low
corona, such as flares, filament eruptions, magnetic reconfigurations, coronal dimmings, EUV waves, jets,
post-eruption arcades, etc. (see, e.g., review by Green et al. 2018). CMEs that do not exhibit any obvious
low-coronal signatures (LCS) are called stealth CMEs (e.g., Robbrecht et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2010; D`Huys
et al., 2014). According to Nitta and Mulligan (2017), most stealth-referred CMEs are not strictly stealth,
thus the term "stealthy" CMEs would be more appropriate, because the apparent lack of some LCSs can be,
at least partly, an instrumental effect (Howard and Harrison, 2013). The most frequent and pronounced LCSs
are solar flares and eruptive filaments. The association of CMEs with prominence/filament eruptions has
been known since decades (e.g., Munro et al., 1979; Sheely et al., 1980; Schmieder et al., 2013; Webb, 2015,
Gopalswamy et al., 2015; Lugaz, 2015). According to the comprehensive statistical study of McCauley et al.
(2015), filaments can by divided into four types: 1) active region (AR) filaments, i.e., filaments which are
found within active regions, 2) intermediate prominences (IP), i.e., filaments located adjacent to or between
ARs, 3) quiescent (QS) filaments, i.e., filaments located well away from ARs in quiet sun regions, and 4)
polar crown (PC) prominences located at high latitudes.

In this paper, we examine whether and how CMEs associated with different types of filaments produce
different in situ signatures at Earth. We classify CME eruptions based on their association with filaments,
following the filament classification by McCauley et al. (2015). We then analyse in detail the corresponding
solar wind parameters (flow speed, v, magnetic field, B, proton density, Np, plasma-, and thermal speed, Vth)
in several regions of the corresponding ICME. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the
data and techniques used to identify isolated Earth-impacting CME/ICME pairs. In Section 3, we analyse
CME source locations, classify them based on their association with filaments, and study the particularities
of the corresponding ICME in situ signatures. In Section 4, we present a detailed analysis of the SW
parameters in different regions of the ICMEs, inspect how they differ regarding the types of associated
filaments, and discuss the outcome. In Section 5, the results are briefly summarized.

2. Data and Method

To identify reliable CME/ICME pairs, we combined CME kinematic measurements with in situ data from
Wind. Firstly, we visually identified all CMEs using image sequences of the outer coronagraphs COR2
(Howard et al., 2008) onboard STEREO-A and STEREO-B as well as LASCO C3 (Brueckner et al., 1995)
onboard SOHO, to estimate whether the CME is oriented towards Earth or not. We selected the time period
from January 2008 to August 2014 based on the availability of data from LASCO/C3 and both STEREO-A
and STEREO-B COR2 coronagraphs (in October 2014, communication with the STEREO-B spacecraft was
completely lost, but already from the very beginning of September 2014 the data required for this study was
not useful). We cross-checked all our identifications (in total 1644 CMEs) with that of the SOHO LASCO
(https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/) and CACTus (http://sidc.oma.be/cactus/) CME catalogues. In the
following we focus only on events that were observed by all three spacecraft.

For each CME selected, we estimated its position angle (PA) from the white light coronagraph
observations as the angular position of the point on the CME bright leading edge at the middle of the
opening angle, measured counter-clockwise from the north. Using the PAs of CMEs estimated from
STEREO-A and -B COR2 images, we selected potentially Earth-directed CMEs, taking into account that
when STEREO-A and-B are in quadrature with SOHO, back-sided CMEs have PAs in the range 180° - 360°
in the COR2-A FOV, and 0° - 180° in the COR2-B FOV. We applied such a procedure only when the
separation angle between STEREO-A and -B was larger than 60°. After isolating the front-side CMEs, we
estimated their propagation direction by taking into account the location of the associated low coronal
signatures (Section 4).

Figure 1 illustrates the procedure for the CME which erupted on 15 February 2011. In this case, the
longitudinal separation between the STEREO-A and STEREO-B spacecraft was 181°, whereas the
separation angles with respect to the Earth were  94° and  87°, respectively. The directions of motion are
in the STEREO-A COR2, LASCO C3 and STEREO-B COR2 coronagraphs,
East, Halo and West
respectively. The source region was located approximately 5° west of the Sun-Earth line. Furthermore, after
taking into account the average CME opening angle based on the STEREO-A and -B observations,
uncertainties in estimating the source region coordinates, and the possibility of non-radial propagation as
well as possible CME deflection, we estimated that if the CME is launched within 40 from the Sun-Earth
line, it is potentially an Earth-impacting CME. In this way, we found that out of the identified 1644 CMEs,
439 (27%) were potential candidates for the Earth-impacting ICMEs (Table 1). A list of CMEs observed by

positions and the CME propagation direction (white arrow). The two
dashed lines depict the cone within which the CME is expected to
propagate.

In the next step, we performed kinematical measurements for every potentially Earth-directed CME in
order to estimate the possible arrival time at Earth. For that purpose, we used the white-light images from
STEREO-A and -B. The two STEREO spacecraft are equipped with the SECCHI instrument suite (Howard
et al., 2008), consisting of an Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al., 2004), two white light
coronagraphs, the inner COR1 and outer COR2 (Thompson et al., 2003; Howard et al., 2008), and the
Heliospheric Imagers (HI1 and HI2; Eyles et al., 2009). In our study, we used only data from COR1, COR2
and HI1, since in the EUVI and HI2 FOV many of the studied events were too dim or diffuse for sufficiently
accurate kinematical measurements. The kinematical measurements are based on the elongation-time data,
(t), of the CME leading-edge in the ecliptic plane, based on visual estimates. The identification of a CME
front in images recorded by the instruments listed was accomplished by comparing their morphology in
successive snapshots and by comparing and matching their elongation-time curves (illustrated in Figure 2 for
the 12 July 2012 CME; for more details of the matching procedure see Maričić et al., 2014). We note that in
cases where the CME drives a shock, we used the shock front signature as the leading-edge segment of the
CME. For the CME tracking, we used running-difference images instead of J-maps, as they provide a better
overview of the morphology and the evolution of the whole CME front during its propagation.

For the conversion of elongations to radial distances, we applied the standard harmonic mean (HM)
fitting method developed by Lugaz (2010) for the stereoscopic observations of ICMEs (see Lugaz, 2010;
Section 3). For the application of this method see, e.g., Möstl et al. (2011), Temmer et al. (2012), Harrison et

SOLA: Maricic2020_v13.tex; 10 August 2020; 9:33; p. 4

al. (2012), Rollett et al. (2012), and Maričić et al. (2014). In addition, we applied the conversion based on
the assumption that the CME is relatively narrow and lies in the plane-of-sky (PoS). Thus, the radial distance
is defined as R = D tan(ε), where D is the distance from the Sun to the observer (hereinafter, the “PoS
method”, Maričić et al. 2014). Note that the PoS conversion method is analogous to the so-called fixed-
conversion (Sheeley et al., 1999; Kahler & Webb, 2007; Rouillard et al., 2008) for a propagation direction
of = 90°. Then, the linear fits to the HM and PoS data were extrapolated, to calculate the expected arrival
time of the ICME at the Wind spacecraft. We emphasize that for the linear-fit extrapolation we used only
data from the COR2 and HI1 STEREO instruments. In Figure 2, we illustrate this method by showing
elongation-time curves, (t) of the 12 July 2012 CME leading-edge measured in the ecliptic plane (Figure
2g), together with the calculated and extrapolated ICME kinematics (Figure 2h).

as calculated by the PoS and HM methods, are marked by pluses.

According to previous studies, ICMEs in situ signatures can be identified applying various criteria,
usually considering smoothness, enhancement, and/or rotation of magnetic field, low plasma-β, expanding
speed profile, presence of a heated and compressed shock/sheath region, etc. (see, e.g., Zurbuchen &

Richardson, 2006; Richardson and Cane, 2010; Kilpua et. al, 2013; Mitsakou and Moussas, 2014; Paouris
and Mavromichalaki, 2017; Kilpua et al., 2017 and references therein). In this study, we searched for any
solar wind disturbance (SWD) in the in situ data within a ±30 hours period around the estimated ICME
arrival time, i.e., we looked for deviations from the quiet solar wind conditions in the four basic solar wind
parameters (magnetic field strength, flow speed, proton density and proton thermal speed). In order to mark
an event as a SWD, we required that it shows a notable enhancement of some of the above mentioned basic
solar wind parameters. In addition, we also checked magnetic field components and fluctuations, as well as
the plasma-β parameter, as indicators of the ICME magnetic structure. We note that the identified SWD
signatures are not necessarily characterized by a period of low density, low temperature, low plasma-β and
smooth rotation of the magnetic field. These signatures may not be present if the spacecraft was not hit by
the apex part of the ICME, as the ICME signatures can be different for different ICME trajectories
(Gopalswamy, 2006). The SWD with a sheath and/or some other ICME signature closest in time to the
estimated arrival of the CME was associated with the CME as its interplanetary counterpart.

To identify ICMEs, we used in situ plasma and magnetic field 1-min resolution data from the Wind

(SWE)
satellite
(http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/index.html) was used only for double checking, i.e., only for
confirmation of the identified solar wind disturbance in the Wind data. To crosscheck our list of
Earth-impacting ICMEs, we consulted several other ICME lists:
- the Wind ICME Catalog
(http://wind.nasa.gov/ICMEindex.php; see Nieves-Chinchilla et al., 2018),

In Figure 3, we illustrate the method how we joined the CME kinematic measurements with the
corresponding SWD in situ data. Based on the CME trajectories derived from the HM fitting method, we
extrapolated the kinematical curves to 1 AU. Out of 439 Earth-directed CMEs, only 103 revealed some of
the SWD in situ signatures in the expected arrival time period at L1, and only 65 showed ICME signatures
(Table 1). The main reason for such a small fraction of CMEs that impacted Earth (about 23%) is most
probably a relatively small angular width of the CMEs/ICMEs and/or a propagation out of the ecliptic plane.
Using the derived CME kinematics, we were also able to identify potential CME-CME interactions.
The criterion for an CME/ICME to be designated as “interacting” is that its kinematical curve intersects with
the extrapolated kinematical curve of another CME/ICME, which should be accompanied by a complex
profile in the in situ data. In Figure 4, we show an example of interacting CMEs which erupted on 12, 13 and
14 June 2012. For similar studies of CME–CME interactions we refer to the studies by, e.g., Liu et al. (2012),
Shen et al. (2012), and Temmer et al. (2012). In the following, we discard all potential interaction events
from the sample, and thus establish a final list of 31 isolated Earth-impacting CME/ICME pairs (Table 2) for
our study.

3. Source Region Locations and Association with Filament Eruptions

For the 31 isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs that were identified in the period 2008 – 2014 (Section 2),
first we analyse their low coronal signatures in more detail. The main reason for this additional analysis is
to identify the solar source location, the association with filament eruptions and flares, and to analyse the
CME propagation direction.

i.e.,

To this aim, STEREO coronagraphic data are combined with SDO extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray
(SXR) data to identify potentially associated solar flares, since the acceleration phase of a CME is often
closely synchronized with the energy release in the associated flare (Zhang et al., 2001; Vršnak et al.,
2004, Maričić et al., 2007; Temmer et al. 2008; 2010, Berkebile-Stoiser et al., 2012, Veronig et al., 2018).
The heliographic location of flares (used in the subsequent analysis as the source location of the CMEs)
was determined using the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE; Woods et al., 2012) onboard
the SAM pinhole camera images and the SXR flux in the 0.1–7 nm channel
SDO,
(http://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/). Two CMEs (9 July 2013 and 14 June 2011) were not
associated with any notable SXR flare. For these two events, the CME solar source location was
determined using SDO/AIA data, by measuring the location of the central part of the associated eruptive
filament. CMEs which are not associated with a prominence eruption, flare emission enhancement, or a
post-flare arcade, are referred as stealthy CMEs (Nitta and Mulligan, 2017). Out of the final set of 31
isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs, four turned out to be stealthy CMEs. Consequently, in the case of these
four CMEs we were not able to pin-point their origin on the Sun.
We divided the isolated Earth-impacting ICME sample into different types with respect to the type of the
associated eruptive filament:

1) Active region (AR) CMEs: These are CMEs that have their origin inside an AR and that are
associated with an AR filament type. In our data set, all CMEs of this type are associated with
GOES X-class flares.

2) Disappearing filament (DSF) CMEs: These are CMEs whose origin is associated with disappearing
filaments of QS or IP type. These filaments can be connected to ARs, but they are not located
inside the AR. The most powerful SXR flare related to this CME type was of GOES class M1.3.
3) Stealthy CMEs: These are CMEs which cannot be related to any filament activation, nor to any

significant increase (stronger than GOES A-class flare) of the SXR flux.

The type of event regarding this classification is presented in the last column of Table 2.

Figure 5 Three examples of isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs (from top to bottom: 12 July 2012, 7 June 2011, and 26 October
2010), recorded by the SDO/EVE SAM pinhole camera, the SDO/AIA 304 A filter, and the COR2 STEREO-A coronagraphs
(from left to right). The 12 July 2012 event represents an eruption with its origin close to the central meridian. The 7 June 2011
event has its origin close to the solar limb. The 26 October 2010 eruption is a “stealthy” CME, showing no low-coronal
signature.

According to Vourlidas et al. (2013), the “classical three part CME” morphology visible in white-light
coronagraph images (Illing and Hundhausen, 1985) can be updated to a “five-part CME” structure. In the
traditional view, the CME consists of a dark cavity, which is surrounded by a bright frontal loop, and an
embedded bright core that is generally assumed to be an erupting prominence (however, for different
interpretations see Howard et al., 2017 and Veronig et al., 2018). Vourlidas et al. (2013) added a two-front
morphology, where the outer bright loop is preceded by a faint sharp front and a broad region of diffuse
the CME-driven shock wave and the
emission. These features were interpreted as a proxy of
shock-associated sheath compression. We adopt a similar reasoning for the in situ ICME measurements.
Furthermore, we noted that in the ICME structure attached to the frontal edge of the magnetic obstacle (MO),
i.e., at the end of the shock-associated turbulent sheath (TS), a region characterised by an additional
enhancement of proton density and flow speed can be often recognized. This enhancement is denoted in
Figures 3a and d as “frontal region” (hereafter, FR). In the following analysis, this part of the ICME is
treated as a separate segment of the ICME.

Next, we analyse whether or not the in situ signatures in some part of the ICME show magnetic cloud
(MC) properties, i.e., contain a region of a smooth rotation of the magnetic field direction, low proton
temperature, and low proton plasma-β
(Burlaga et al., 1981; Burlaga, 1988, 1995; Burlaga et al., 2008,
Kim et al., 2013, Nieves-Chinchilla et al. 2018, 2019). In this respect, we adopt the terminology used by Jian
et al. (2006) and Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2018), where an ICME is denoted as a “magnetic obstacle” (MO)
if even a small region with typical MC signatures is identified, i.e., when the ICME configuration is not
associated with a full single magnetic field rotation. Following this terminology, we divided the sample of
Earth-impacting ICMEs into two categories:

SOLA: Maricic2020_v13.tex; 10 August 2020; 9:33; p.10

1) We denote an ICME as a “magnetic obstacle” (MO) if it contains a structure with MC or MC-like
properties as defined by Rouillard (2011), i.e., corresponding to ICMEs of Group 1 according to Jian et
al. (2006) and F-type according to Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2019).

2) An ICME is termed as "ejecta” (EJ) if it does not show any MC or MC-like properties,

i.e.,
corresponds to Groups 2 and 3 according to Jian et al. (2006), E-type according to Nieves-Chinchilla
et al. (2019), as well as events with typical shock/sheath signatures but without MO signatures.

An example of a MO-ICME is given in Figure 3 and of an EJ-ICME in Figure 6. The MO/EJ types are listed
in Column 16 of Table 2.

We consulted also ICME lists by Richardson & Cane (2010), the Wind ICME catalogue, the HELCATS
LINKCAT catalogue (https://www.helcats-fp7.eu/catalogues/wp4_cat.html), and the ICME list by the
University of Science and Technology of China, and we compared them with our list. We note that some
inconsistencies among the mentioned three lists were found. After a more detailed inspection we inferred
that the detected inconsistencies are either due to differences in terminology, or sometimes, they appeared in
the cases of ICMEs without clear MC signatures where it was not taken into account that the event was
characterized by a flank encounter.

The main characteristics of the identified isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs are listed in Table 2. Column
1 gives the event label, in Columns 2 and 3 the times of the first CME detection in STEREO COR1 are
displayed, Columns 4 - 9 present the onset, magnetic field and plasma parameters of the related in situ SWD,
Columns 10 - 12 define the location and GOES SXR importance of the associated flare, Column 13 specifies
the associated active region, Columns 14 and 15 provide information on the filament type and angular width.
The filament type is acquired from the AIA filament eruption catalog (http://aia.cfa.harvard.edu/filament/),
where the classification by McCauley et al. (2015) is used: active region (AR) filaments, intermediate
prominences (IP), i.e., filaments located adjacent to or between ARs, quiescent (QS) filaments, and polar
crown (PC) filaments. We note that two events (2011 Mar 25 and 2012 May 11) were not found in the AIA
thus we inspected AIA images and Kanzelhohe Observatory filtergrams
filament eruption catalog,
(http://cesar.kso.ac.at/halpha3s/). In this way, we determined that these two events were related to IP
filaments. Let us note that no event was associated with a PC filament. Finally, column 16 lists the MO/EJ
ICME type, and column 17 the CME source-region type. In column 16, the MOs are identified following the
criteria of Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2018, 2019).

4. Results and related Discussions

Out of the 31 isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs considered in this study, 17 events (~55%) are not associated
with a MO, whereas 14 events (~45%) contain a MO structure. Out of the 14 MO events, four were stealthy
CMEs, so their source-region location is unknown. We found a significant difference between the source
location of MO- and EJ-ICMEs (Figure 7). 90% of the 10 non-stealthy MO-CMEs (9/10) have their source
location within ±30° from the central meridian of the Sun; the only exception is the 13 March 2012 event as
its source location is N17W66. On the other hand, 94% of EJ-CMEs (16/17) have their source region outside
±30° from the central meridian; the only exception is the 21 June 2011 event with a source location N17W10.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the source region locations of 27 CMEs (four stealthy CMEs are
excluded). The mean longitude (|l|) of the 10 non-stealthy MO events is East 3.7 ± 2°, whereas for the East

and the West population of EJ events the mean central meridian distances are East 58.1° ± 2° and West 69.7°

± 2°, respectively. This clearly shows that the source regions of MO-ICMEs are grouped close to the solar
disc centre, whereas EJ-CMEs are grouped closer to the solar limb, indicating that MO-associated CMEs
propagate more directly toward the Earth. The existence of events, which have their origin located more than
±30° away from the central meridian but are associated with a MO, or events inside the ±30° region that are
not associated with a MO, could be caused by a non-radial CME propagation from the source region, or
deflection from their original direction (see, e.g., Möstl et al., (2015) and Kim et al. (2013)). These results
support the hypothesis that ICMEs show different in situ signatures depending on the spacecraft trajectory
across the ICME (see e.g. Jian et al., 2006; Richardson & Cane, 2010; Kilpua et al., 2017 and references
therein). Finally, we note that the difference between the mentioned mean source region longitudes for the
EJ E/W events (~58°E vs. ~70°W) is consistent with the so-called eastward deflection, as a significant
fraction of the EJ events is faster than the nominals slow solar wind (see Table 2; average speed is 496 ± 22
kms-1). Consequently, to hit Earth the East-hemisphere events must have their origin closer to the central
meridian than those launched from the West-hemisphere.

EJ-ICMEs with a source location longitude larger than ±30° from the central meridian, cause a specific
signature in the solar wind in situ data. Figure 6 shows an example of such an ICME signature. The data
reveal a simple structure of the interplanetary disturbance, characterized by a simultaneous increase of the
magnetic field strength, thermal velocity, proton density, and solar wind speed, and not exposing any clear
signature of the rotation of the magnetic field, or a low plasma-β. After the initial sharp increase, the flow
speed, thermal velocity and magnetic field strength are characterized by a gradual decrease. The average of
the peak values of the magnetic field strength, solar wind speed, proton density, and thermal velocity, for the
17 EJ-ICMEs are 11.85 ± 1.61 nT, 496 ± 22 kms-1, 15.52 ± 2.11 cm-3, and 76.82 ± 5.81 kms-1, respectively.
Bearing in mind the close-to-limb source-region locations of EJ-ICMEs, one can conclude that they are
observed when the ICME passes over the spacecraft by its flank. For comparison, the average of the peak
values of the magnetic field strength, solar wind speed, proton density and thermal velocity for the 10
non-stealthy MO-ICMEs are 17.95 ± 2.05 nT, 582 ± 53 kms-1, 24.8 ± 4.9 cm-3 and 163 ± 13 kms-1,
respectively, i.e., are significantly higher than in the case of EJ-ICMEs.

Figure 7 Distribution of the source region locations for MO-ICMEs (red dots) and EJ-ICMEs (blue dots).

In the next step, a more detailed analysis of the in situ Wind measurements of MO-ICMEs was performed.
We compared the characteristics of the three structural elements of these ICMEs (cf. Figure 3): the turbulent
sheath (TS), the frontal region (FR), and the magnetic obstacle (MO). The second vertical dashed line in
Figure 3a-e represents the border between the TS and FR, while the third one represents the end of the FR,
i.e., the onset of the MO. In all three ICME segments, we read out the maximum value of the magnetic field
strength, the change in the GSE magnetic field components, the flow speed, maximum values of the flow
speed,
temperature, proton density, and plasma-β. Figure 8 shows various correlations between the
maximum values of the magnetic field strength, Bmax, in the three MO-ICME regions (TS, FR and MO). In
each panel we display the linear least-squares fit and the Pearson correlation coefficient. The highest
correlation coefficient cc = 0.96 is found for the correlation between the maximum magnetic field strengths
in TS and FR, whereas analogous TS/MO and FR/MO correlations are characterised by somewhat lower
values, cc = 0.87 and 0.86, respectively (Figures 8a-c).

Figure 8 Correlations concerning the maximum magnetic field magnitude, Bmax, in the three different segments of MO-ICMEs:
turbulent sheath (TS), frontal region (FR) and magnetic obstacle (MO). a) TS vs. FR; b) TS vs. MO; c) FR vs. MO. In panels d, e,
and f, plots analogous to those in panels a, b, and c are shown, but the ICMEs are divided into different types: AR-events (blue),
DSF-events (black), and stealthy CMEs (red). Note that some data-points overlap.

The strong correlation of Bmax in TSs and FRs is not surprising since these two regions both contain
ambient solar wind plasma compressed by the MO motion. The TS represents the downstream region of the
shock structure that most often has partly characteristics of a freely propagating wave, and partly is still
affected by the MO acting as a piston (for the characteristics and evolution of fast-mode MHD waves see,
e.g., Vršnak & Lulić, 2000, and Sect. 2 in Warmuth, 2015). Note that although the characteristics of the
shock downstream regions are determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot jump relations, i.e., by the shock
amplitude, they are partly affected by the characteristics of the FR, since the plasma flow in the FR still
feeds the shock and thus affects the shock amplitude. This results in a strong correlation between TS and FR.
On the other hand, although the characteristics of the FR, and thus also the TS are governed by the MO
motion,
the correlation of TS and FR with MO is somewhat weaker, since the MO structure is a
magnetically isolated entity that contains plasma carried from below, whereas the TS and FR segments
contain compressed solar wind plasma and “open” magnetic field.

SOLA: Maricic2020_v13.tex; 10 August 2020; 9:33; p.16

The relations between the different ICME segments were further analysed, focusing on the filament type
associated with the CME. According to Table 2, 87% of the isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs in our sample
are associated with filament eruptions, whereas 13% (4/31) are not (stealthy CMEs). 55% (17/31) of CMEs
are associated with the AR filaments, and 32% (10/31) are associated with QS or IP filament type (i.e., DSF
type). In Figures 8d-f, we divided the ICME data set into three different subsets: AR, DSF, and stealthy type.
Again, distinct correlations are found between the values of Bmax for all filament types.

In the case of the TS/FR correlation (Figure 8d), the correlation coefficients for AR, DSF, and stealthy
ICME types are similar (cc = 0.91, 0.98, and 0.95, respectively). We note that all three types show very
similar correlation patterns, i.e., all data-points are grouped in a compact cloud. Such an outcome is not
surprising, since both the TS and the FR region consist of compressed ambient solar wind plasma and
directly affect each other.

On the other hand, when the TS/MO and FR/MO correlations are considered (Figures 8e and f), one finds
a somewhat different situation. Here, the three ICME types reveal significantly different regression lines. In
the case of the TS/MO correlation,
the DSF-sample shows a twice steeper regression line than the
AR-sample, whereas the stealthy-sample behaves similarly to the AR-sample. All three correlations (DSF,
AR, stealthy; Figure 8e) have high correlation coefficients, cc = 0.97, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. In the
case of the FR/MO correlation, shown on Figure 8f, one finds a similar situation: the DSF-sample again
shows a twice steeper regression line than the AR-sample. The correlations coefficients are cc = 0.98, 0.85,
and 0.97 for the DSF, AR, and stealthy ICMEs, respectively.

Different linear dependencies of Bmax found for AR and DSF types in the TS/MO and FR/MO correlations
suggest that these three ICME types differ probably due to the fact that they originate from different solar
magnetic field environments. Events coming from ARs should carry stronger magnetic field than those
whose origin is in quiet sun regions. Thus, MO of AR-ICMEs tend to have stronger fields than DSF-ICMEs
(see Table 3 and Figures 8e and f), whereas the ambient solar wind field, composing the TS and FR
segments, should be similar in both ICME types. Consequently, the considered magnetic field ratio is
different, leading to a different inclination of the regression lines. Following this logic, the similarity of the
correlations for DSF and stealthy ICME types shown in Figure 8e suggest that stealthy ICMEs are probably
launched from quiet sun regions. Note also that the difference between the correlations in both Figure 8e and
Figure 8f also enlarged the scatter of data points, i.e., decreased the correlation coefficients in Figures 8b and
c.

In Figure 9, we present the TS/FR, TS/MO, and FR/MO correlations, regarding the bulk solar wind speed,
vmax, the proton density, Npmax, and the proton thermal speed, vthmax. The strongest correlations are found for
vmax, characterised by cc = 0.96, 0.93, and 0.94, for TS-FR, TS-MO, and FR-MO correlations, respectively
(Figures 9a-c). Such an outcome is expected since the flow speeds in TS and FR are physically tightly
connected. The FR compression is directly attached to the MO, thus both must have the same speed at the
contact surface. This results in the linear regression slope, k, close to k = 1 (more specifically, k = 0.91, see
Figure 9c). Similarly, the shock amplitude, thus also the flow speed in the shock downstream region are
governed by the MO speed. However, in the case of the bow-shock type, i.e., the shock at least partly driven
by the MO, this speed is expected to be lower than that of the MO itself, which resulted in
k < 1 for the
TS/MO correlation and consequently, also for the TS/FR correlation (more specifically, k = 0.86 and 0.82
for TS/FR and TS/MO correlations, respectively, see Figures 9a and b).

For Npmax, a significant correlation is found only for the TS/FR correlation, with cc = 0.78 (Figure 9d),
which is a consequence of a tight physical connection between these two regions. Similarly, in the case of
the thermal speed, vthmax, a strong correlation is found for the TS/FR correlation (cc = 0.95, see Figure 9g).
The TS/MO and FR/MO relations show a significantly weaker correlation coefficients (cc = 0.77 and 0.84,
respectively, see Figures 9h and i) as expected, as TS and FR segments are representing magneto-plasma
systems different from that of MO.

5. Summary

In this paper, we analysed the characteristics of isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs by combining remote
sensing observations of CMEs and associated flares and filaments using the STEREO-SECCHI,
SOHO-LASCO, SDO-EVE and SDO-AIA instruments, in combination with the in situ Wind plasma and
magnetic field measurements. We identified 31 isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs, which we divided into
those containing a Magnetic Obstacle (MO) structure in the in situ data, and those that do not show an MO
signature (ejecta, EJ). A detailed analysis of the magnetic field and plasma characteristics in different
MO-ICME segments was performed. In addition, we classified the ICMEs into different types according to
their solar source region and filament association, distinguishing active region CMEs (AR), quiet sun CMEs
(DSF), and stealthy CMEs. The main results and interpretations of our study are as follows.

a) A significant difference was found between the solar source location of MO-ICMEs and EJ-ICMEs. In
the vast majority of cases, MO-ICMEs source regions are grouped close to the solar disc centre (90%

SOLA: Maricic2020_v13.tex; 10 August 2020; 9:33; p.18

of them are located at a central meridian distances (CMD) within ±30°), indicating that they are
directed more or less towards the Earth. On the other hand, the majority of EJ-ICMEs originate from
regions located closer to the solar limb (94% of them are found out of a CMD distance of ±30°, with a
mean CMD of 65°).

b) Whereas in situ signatures of MO-ICMEs are characterized by the presence of a flux rope in at least
some part of their structure, the EJ-ICMEs do not contain such a signature. This indicates, together
with item a), that EJ-ICMEs hit the Earth with the ICME flank, whereas MO-ICMEs hit the Earth with
the ICME apex, which is also consistent with item a).

c) CMEs can be divided according to their association with filament types: active region filaments,
AR-CMEs; quiet-sun disappearing filaments, DSF-CMEs, and stealthy CMEs. The mean values of the
peak magnetic field are Bmax = 18.5 nT for AR-ICMEs, 17.1 nT for DSF-ICMEs, and 11.6 nT for
stealthy ICMEs.

d) A strong correlation is found between Bmax measured in the turbulent sheath (TS) and frontal region
(FR), with cc = 0.96. Somewhat weaker, but still well defined, are the correlations of Bmax values in TS
and FR vs. those measured in the magnetic obstacle, MO (cc = 0.87 and 0.86, respectively).

f)

e) When taken separately, the TS/FR correlations for AR, DSF, and stealthy CME types show similar
regression lines, with a correlation of cc = 0.91, 0.98 and 0.95, respectively. The three subsets of data
points are grouped in a compact cloud, resulting in the strong TS/FR correlation mentioned under item
d). This indicates that there is a strong physical relationship between TS and FR, both consisting of
compressed ambient solar wind plasma.
In the case of the TS/MO as well as FR/MO correlations, the AR, DSF, and stealthy types show a
significantly different slope of the linear relationship for both the TS/MO and FR/MO correlations, and
overall, the data-points are more scattered than in the TS/FR case. On the other hand, the individual
correlations for the AR, DSF, and stealthy types are very strong for the TS/MO relationship (cc = 0.97,
0.99 and 0.99, respectively), as well as for the FR/MC relationship (cc = 0.85, 0.97 and 0.98
respectively).

g) Strong correlations are also found for the peak values of the flow speed, vmax (cc = 0.96, 0.93, and 0.94

for TS/FR, TS/MO, and FR/MO correlations, respectively).

h) In the case of the peak proton density, Npmax, a correlation is found only between the values measured
in TS and FR (cc = 0.78). The values of Npmax in these two ICME segments are not correlated with
those in the MO segment.

i) The peak proton thermal speed in TS is strongly correlated with that measured in FR (cc = 0.95). The
correlations of the TS and FR values vs. MO values are somewhat weaker (cc = 0.77 and 0.84,
respectively).
