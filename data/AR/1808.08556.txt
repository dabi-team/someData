Abstract

The 36Ar(n, γ)37Ar (t1/2 = 35 d) and 38Ar(n, γ)39Ar (269 y) reactions were studied for the ﬁrst

time with a quasi-Maxwellian (kT ∼ 47 keV) neutron ﬂux for Maxwellian Average Cross Section

(MACS) measurements at stellar energies. Gas samples were irradiated at the high-intensity Soreq

applied research accelerator facility-liquid-lithium target neutron source and the 37Ar/36Ar and

39Ar/38Ar ratios in the activated samples were determined by accelerator mass spectrometry at

the ATLAS facility (Argonne National Laboratory). The 37Ar activity was also measured by low-

level counting at the University of Bern. Experimental MACS of 36Ar and 38Ar, corrected to

the standard 30 keV thermal energy, are 1.9(3) mb and 1.3(2) mb, respectively, diﬀering from

the theoretical and evaluated values published to date by up to an order of magnitude. The

neutron capture cross sections of 36,38Ar are relevant to the stellar nucleosynthesis of light neutron-

rich nuclides; the two experimental values are shown to aﬀect the calculated mass fraction of

nuclides in the region A=36-48 during the weak s-process. The new production cross sections have

implications also for the use of 37Ar and 39Ar as environmental tracers in the atmosphere and

hydrosphere.

The argon isotopes 36Ar and 38Ar are among the rare stable nuclides for which no exper-

imental neutron-capture cross sections exist above thermal energy. While the abundances

of 36,38Ar in terrestrial atmospheric argon are very low relative to 40Ar (produced mainly

from 40K decay [1, 2]), 36Ar (84.59%) and 38Ar (15.38%) are the major argon isotopes in

the solar system [3] and likely so in stellar matter. They are expected, together with the

branching point 39Ar, to play a role in nucleosynthesis of light neutron-rich nuclei (e.g. 36S,

40Ar, 40K), believed to be produced during the weak s-process phase of stellar evolution

[4, 5]. The 40K (t1/2=1.248(3) Gy [6]) nuclide, in particular, is an important cosmo- or

geochronometer and was used to estimate the age and duration of the s-process as ∼10 Gy

[7, 8]. 40K can be produced also in explosive oxygen burning [9] as a primary nucleosyn-

thesis product in a massive star of initially pure hydrogen while the (secondary) s-process

production of 40K requires initial abundances of heavy species. A better understanding of

Ar cross sections will help clarify the relative primary vs. secondary production of 40K. In

a diﬀerent realm of study, the half-life of 37Ar (t1/2=35.011(19) d [10]) makes this isotope
an ideal chronometer for studying circulation and mixing [11], and that of 39Ar (269(3) y

[12]) for dating groundwater [13, 14] and ocean water up to about 1000 years [15]. The

atmospheric steady state concentrations of 37Ar and 39Ar are mainly determined by the

spallation reactions 40Ar(n, 4n)37Ar and 40Ar(n, 2n)39Ar and at lower neutron energies by

the 36Ar(n, γ)37Ar and 38Ar(n, γ)39Ar reactions [11]. The latter are also relevant for the

estimation of anthropogenic emissions from nuclear installations or for nuclear explosion

monitoring [16].

We measured the 36Ar and 38Ar neutron capture cross sections by activation with quasi-

Maxwellian neutrons produced by the 7Li(p, n) reaction at the superconducting linear accel-

erator of Soreq applied research accelerator facility (SARAF) [17, 18] and the Liquid-Lithium

Target (LiLiT) [19, 20]. The activation products 37Ar and 39Ar were counted oﬄine by ac-

celerator mass spectrometry (AMS); 37Ar production was also determined by Low-Level

Counting (LLC). Neutron irradiation of separate 36Ar and 38Ar samples was performed at

the pneumatic transfer tube (rabbit) of the Soreq IRR-1 nuclear reactor in order to re-

measure the respective thermal neutron capture cross sections. Preliminary results of these

experiments were reported in [21, 22].

Enriched 36Ar, 38Ar and mixed 38Ar+natAr gas samples were ﬁlled into Ti spheres (10

mm outer diameter, 0.2 mm thick Ti shell) [23]. Due to the thermodynamical properties of

were enriched to 99.935% and 99.957% for the respective isotopes. The ﬁnal 37Ar/36Ar ratios were

obtained by taking a weighted average of the AMS and LLC results (Fig. 2). Sphere #52a was

irradiated with 1 mm thick Cd shield to estimate the epithermal neutron fraction. The 38Ar/natAr

ratio for sphere 54 (52b) is 11.7 (10.2). For more details see the Supplemental Material [28].

Ar, the ﬁlling was made by successive compression with a custom-made piston and cryogenic

pumping in order to achieve the required pressure (∼30 bar). The samples used are listed in

Table I. For the samples irradiated at SARAF-LiLiT (Table I), each gas sphere was placed

with a 25 mm-diameter Au foil (12.5 µm thick), used as a neutron ﬂuence monitor in an

evacuated chamber downstream of LiLiT (Fig. 1). LiLiT consists of a windowless ﬁlm of

liquid lithium (1.5 mm thick, 18 mm wide) ﬂowing at 2-3 m/s, serving as both the neutron-

producing target and the kW-power beam dump for the incident ∼1.5 mA proton beam

[19, 20]. The distance from the neutron source to the center of the Ar-ﬁlled sphere was 11.3

mm, intercepting ∼ 30% of the outgoing neutrons. The proton beam energy, measured by

Rutherford back scattering oﬀ a Au target after the acceleration module, was found to be

1932 ± 3 (1940 ± 3) keV for the 36Ar (38Ar) irradiation. A proton beam energy spread of ∼15

keV, estimated from beam dynamics calculations, was veriﬁed experimentally [24]. Auto-

radiographic scans [25] of the Au foils were conducted to determine proton beam centering.

An oﬀset of 2.0 (2.2) mm for the 36Ar (38Ar) irradiation was found; this oﬀset was accounted

for in our simulations. The neutron yield was continuously monitored with a ﬁssion-product

ionization chamber [26], located ∼80 cm downstream the target at 0◦. The ﬁssion chamber

count rate was calibrated to beam current (at low intensity) using a Faraday cup located

∼1 m upstream of the Li target. The total integrated current was ∼10.8 (7.35) milliampere

hour for the 36Ar (38Ar) irradiation (Fig. 1).

The 37Ar nuclide decays by pure electron capture with no γ-ray emission; 37Ar is notable

for its role in Davis’ solar neutrino experiment [29] where its production via 37Cl(νe, e−)37Ar
was detected by Auger electron counting. We detected and counted for the ﬁrst time 37Ar

by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the ATLAS facility of Argonne National Lab-

from the sphere container into an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source through

a remote-controlled sapphire leak valve. 36,37Ar8+ ions were extracted from the ion source

and accelerated alternately through ATLAS at an energy of 6 MeV/u by appropriate scaling

of all accelerator elements. It was found necessary to strip the 37Ar8+ ions and count 37Ar18+

(fully stripped) in order to suppress the 37Cl (Z=17) background. Stripping was done with a

200 µg/cm2 C foil at an intermediate stage of the ATLAS linear accelerator. The stripping

process (normally not used in AMS measurements at ATLAS) however produced an isotope

fractionation and the eﬀective beam transmission eﬃciency (1.84(18)×10−2) was determined

by interpolation between the measured 36Ar and 38Ar transmissions. The 37Ar18+ ions were

counted using a ∆E-E telescope of Si detectors, 50 and 300 µm thick, respectively, showing

background-free spectra; the detection sensitivity in the present experiment was 37Ar/Ar

∼ 10−15 (see Supplemental Material [28]).

The 37Ar activity of the same samples was also determined by ultra-low-level counting

(LLC) in a second stage. Stainless steel vials containing ∼1 cm3 aliquots of the same

activated samples were shipped to the University of Bern. Each gas was quantitatively

transferred into a 100 cm3 copper proportional counter which was then ﬁlled with P6 gas

(6% methane + 94% commercial 37Ar-free argon) to a pressure of ∼6 bars. The 37Ar activity

was measured by detecting Auger electrons in an underground LLC laboratory during 1-2

days [16, 30]. Energy calibration was performed with copper K-shell X-rays (E=8.133 keV)

induced by an external 241Am γ source. The 37Ar peak was identiﬁed at the K-capture decay

energy of 2.82 keV [31] and integrated by means of a Gaussian ﬁt [28]. The amount of 36Ar in

the sample was determined, after 37Ar counting, from the ﬁlling pressure of the detector and

the 40Ar/36Ar ratio measured by mass spectrometry [32] using established procedures. The

overall uncertainty of 8% of the ﬁnal 37Ar/36Ar ratio is dominated by counting statistics

and the uncertainties of counting yield (5%) [28]. A comparison of the 37Ar/36Ar ratios

measured by AMS and LLC is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Accelerator Mass Spectrometry of 39Ar has been previously performed at ATLAS [33, 34].

A high ion energy is essential for the separation and discrimination of 39Ar from the extremely

intense source background of the stable 39K isobar. In our experiment, the ECR was operated

at low power to reduce as much as possible impinging of the plasma onto the chamber walls,

believed to be a source of 39K contamination. 38,39,40Ar8+ ions were accelerated to 6 MeV/u,

similarly as described before and 39Ar8+ ions were analyzed in the Enge gas-ﬁlled magnetic

spectrograph [35], which physically separates 39Ar from beam contaminants, e.g. 39K8+ and

34S7+, which have close-by m/q values (Fig. 3). The accelerator transmission eﬃciency for

39Ar8+ (0.40(3)) was interpolated between those of 38Ar8+ and 40Ar8+ [28].

In the reactor irradiations, two small Au samples were attached to the 36Ar and 38Ar

spheres for neutron monitoring, using 98.65(9) b [37] for the 197Au thermal neutron capture

cross section. A minor correction for the epithermal activation of Au was applied, using the

198Au activity measured for a gas sphere entirely shielded with 1 mm thick Cd. In contrast to

the 36Ar sample, two 38Ar samples irradiated at the reactor (Table I) were mixed with natAr

[28]. The 36,38Ar measured thermal capture cross sections are listed in Table II. Uncertainties

(1σ) for 36Ar (38Ar) are 3% (2%) and 7% (11%) from the neutron ﬂuence and atom ratio

determinations, respectively.

the neutron ﬂuence, Φn, was conﬁrmed by comparing the value calculated in this way for

the Au (planar) monitor with its measured activity; experimental and calculated values

agree within 0.5%. The values of Φn (n/cm2) and σexp for 36Ar (38Ar) are 6.2(1)×1014
(4.22(9)×1014) and 1.4(1) mb (0.95(10) mb), respectively. Uncertainties (1σ) for the 36Ar

(38Ar) experimental cross section σexp are 2% (2%) and 7% (11%) from the neutron ﬂuence

and atom ratio determinations, respectively.

The experimental cross section measured in our experiments is an energy-averaged value

over the neutron spectrum and interpretation in terms of a Maxwellian Averaged Cross

Section (MACS) requires knowledge of the shape of the spectrum. The integral neutron

spectrum seen by the targets under the irradiation conditions of the experiment is however

not measurable. Instead we rely on detailed simulations using the codes SimLiT [50] for the

thick-target 7Li(p, n) neutron yield, and GEANT4 [51] for neutron transport (Fig. 1) [52].

The SimLiT-GEANT4 simulations have been carefully benchmarked in separate experiments

and excellent agreement with experimental time-of-ﬂight and (diﬀerential and integral) en-

ergy spectra was obtained [50, 52, 53]. The simulated neutron spectrum, dnsim

is well ﬁtted

in the range En ∼ 0 − 110 keV (∼ 90% of the incident neutrons) by a Maxwell-Boltzmann
(MB) ﬂux v dnM B

∝ Enexp(−En/kT ) with kT ∼ 47 keV (Fig. 1). The quantitative normal-

ization of the neutron spectrum, dnsim

, was obtained by comparing the experimental number

of 198Au nuclei (measured by gamma activity with a high-purity germanium detector) in the

Au foil monitor with the number of 198Au nuclei calculated in the detailed simulation of the

entire setup (see [52] for details).

We calculate the MACS at a given thermal energy kT with the procedure developed in

[52, 54], using the expression M ACS(kT ) = 2√

σ(En) may have coherent contributions from compound-resonances and (weakly energy de-

pendent) direct captures (DC). We note here that σexp includes all contributions in the

experimental energy range; we use in Eq. (1) the Hauser-Feshbach model for the energy

dependence of σ(En) in the wider MB range and estimate the additional uncertainties as-

sociated with direct capture. In order to account for the sensitivity to the low density of

available compound states in 37,39Ar, we apply diﬀerent codes [28]: TENDL-2014 [55], -

2015 [48], -2017 [56] and TALYS-1.8 [57] with a microscopic level density and average the

CH-F (kT ) values obtained; the greater of 20% of the correction or their standard deviation

is attributed to the MACS corrections. It should however be noted that the extrapolation

of the MACS to diﬀerent thermal energies and determination of their uncertainties were

made using a limited number of theoretical models, due to the total absence of experimental

knowledge of resonances in the 37,39Ar compound nuclei. We also add an estimated inde-

pendent 15% uncertainty from s-wave and p-wave DC contributions. Detailed calculations

of the correction factor and its uncertainties will be included in an expanded version of this

Letter. Our MACS values and uncertainties are listed in Table II and compared to existing

theoretical values.

The experimental MACS values (Table II) obtained in this work are notably diﬀerent

from previous calculations. Fig. 4 shows the 36,38Ar(n, γ) reaction rates (NA (cid:104)σv(cid:105)) based

on our measurements and extrapolation to diﬀerent temperatures, compared to the rates

adopted so far [49]. In order to show the potential eﬀect of these experimental rates on stellar

nucleosynthesis, we performed a single-zone network calculation using physical conditions

appropriate for the He core burning phase of a massive star in which the new 36,38Ar(n, γ)

rates are used, leaving all others unchanged [49]. The calculations are done using the single-

zone NucNet Tools reaction network code [58] starting at the H-burning phase with solar

abundances [3] and continuing into a single-zone He core burning (T= 300 MK, density of

1 kg/cm3). Substantial (10-50%) changes in the calculated mass fractions for neutron-rich

light nuclides between 34S and 58Fe are observed (Fig. 5), reminiscent of the sensitivity

observed in the weak s-process region (A∼56-70) due to the change of a single cross section

[59]. The mass fraction of 36Ar itself is observed to increase by a factor of ∼10 due to its

calculated mass fraction of the important cosmo/geo-chronometer 40K implying a weaker

contribution of the secondary s-process relative to primary production. As shown in Frank

only or secondary only. For example, with a larger primary production of 40K which is the

in these worlds even early in the Galaxy history.

The measurements of the 36Ar(n, γ) cross sections aﬀect also the calculation of the natural

37Ar background activity in the atmosphere, the interpretation of 37Ar emission rates in

underground nuclear explosion monitoring [16] and the investigation of atmospheric air

circulation [11]. The detection of 37Ar by AMS demonstrated here opens the way to an

alternative method for the monitoring of environmental samples [22]. Similarly to 37Ar,

the 38Ar(n, γ)39Ar reaction contributes to the 39Ar production rate in the atmosphere [11]

[13, 14, 61].

In summary, ﬁrst measurements of the neutron capture cross sections of 36Ar and 38Ar

at stellar energies were performed. The experimental value for 36Ar, in particular, is smaller

than the one adopted so far from theoretical calculations and evaluations by a factor of

∼10. Nucleosynthesis calculations for the weak s-process regime using the measured cross

sections are shown to increase the mass fraction of 36Ar by a factor of ∼10 and lower the

residual mass fraction of neutron-rich nuclides in the region A=36-48 by 10 to 50%. The

36,38Ar(n, γ) cross sections aﬀect the interpretation of environmental monitoring using 37Ar

or 39Ar as geophysical tracers.

TABLE III. Samples used and the results of the A+1Ar/AAr ratio after the irradiation for all gas

samples. 36Ar and 38Ar gas samples [27] were enriched to 99.935% and 99.957% for the respective

isotopes. The ﬁnal 37Ar/36Ar ratios were obtained by taking a weighted average of the AMS and

LLC results (Fig. 2). Sphere #52a was irradiated with 1 mm thick Cd shield to estimate the

epithermal neutron fraction.
