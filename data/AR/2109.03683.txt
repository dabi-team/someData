ABSTRACT

The distribution of ejecta in young supernova remnants oﬀers a powerful observational probe of
their explosions and progenitors. Here we present a 3D reconstruction of the ejecta in SNR 0540-69.3,
which is an O-rich remnant with a pulsar wind nebula located in the LMC. We use observations from
VLT/MUSE to study Hβ, [O III] λλ4959, 5007, Hα, [S II] λλ6717, 6731, [Ar III] λ7136 and [S III] λ9069.
This is complemented by 2D spectra from VLT/X-shooter, which also cover [O II] λλ3726, 3729 and
[Fe II] λ12567. We identify three main emission components: (i) Clumpy rings in the inner nebula
((cid:46) 1000 km s−1) with similar morphologies in all lines; (ii) Faint extended [O III] emission dominated
by an irregular ring-like structure with radius ∼ 1600 km s−1 and inclination ∼ 40◦, but with maximal
velocities reaching ∼ 3000 km s−1; and (iii) A blob of Hα and Hβ located southeast of the pulsar
at velocities ∼ 1500 − 3500 km s−1. We analyze the geometry using a clump-ﬁnding algorithm and
use the clumps in the [O III] ring to estimate an age of 1146 ± 116 years. The observations favor
an interpretation of the [O III] ring as ejecta, while the origin of the H-blob is more uncertain. An
alternative explanation is that it is the blown-oﬀ envelope of a binary companion. From the detection
of Balmer lines in the innermost ejecta we conﬁrm that SNR 0540 was a Type II supernova and that
hydrogen was mixed down to low velocities in the explosion.

tures of mixing. Predictions include fast Ni plumes and
anisotropic fallback (e.g., Stockinger et al. 2020; Gabler
et al. 2021; Sandoval et al. 2021). The fact that SNe are
not spherical is known from a large number of obser-
vations, not least from imaging of young SN remnants

these objects, the observed Doppler shifts can be directly

This means that the 3D emissivity of the ejecta can be
directly reconstructed from the combination of spectral
and imaging information.

SNR 0540-69.3 (hereafter SNR 0540) is a ∼ 1000 year
old SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It is
often referred to as the “Crab twin” as its 50 ms pul-
sar and associated pulsar wind nebula (PWN) are sim-
ilar to those of the Crab Nebula. However, many other
properties of the remnant are not Crab-like. Most no-
tably, SNR 0540 is O-rich, is thought to originate from
a more massive progenitor ((cid:38) 15 M(cid:12), Chevalier 2006;
Williams et al. 2008) and shows a shell of emission due
to the interaction between the blast wave and surround-
ing medium. The shell has a radius of ∼ 30(cid:48)(cid:48) and emits
in radio, millimeter and X-rays (Manchester et al. 1993;
Hwang et al. 2001; Brantseg et al. 2014; Lundqvist et al.
2020).

Larsson et al.

The optical line emission in SNR 0540 is powered by
the PWN. Most of the emission is concentrated to a
region of ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48) radius (Kirshner et al. 1989; Seraﬁmovich
et al. 2005; Morse et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2008),1 but
there is also a faint halo of [O III] emission that extends
to at least ∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48) (Morse et al. 2006). The detection of
H lines from the inner region (Seraﬁmovich et al. 2005;
Morse et al. 2006) implies that the SN was a Type II,
something that was previously not appreciated.

The [O III] λ5007 and [S II] λλ6717, 6731 emission
from the inner region have previously been studied in 3D
using VLT/VIMOS observations, which revealed ring-
like structures (Sandin et al. 2013). Here we present
new information about the 3D structure of the ejecta us-
ing observations from VLT/MUSE and X-shooter. The
analysis includes a number of lines not previously stud-
ied in 3D, as well as higher-resolution maps for [S II] and
[O III] for a larger ﬁeld of view (FOV) than the VIMOS
maps of Sandin et al. (2013). We focus on emission that
can be clearly connected to fast-moving material asso-
ciated with SNR 0540, which turns out to be conﬁned
to a region within ∼ 17(cid:48)(cid:48) of the pulsar. The outer re-
gions, including any possible emission associated with
the radio/X-ray shell, will be studied as part of a se-
ries of forthcoming papers based on the MUSE and X-
shooter observations of SNR 0540.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we
describe the observations and data reduction. Section 3
details how we construct the 3D maps from the observa-
tions, while the results are presented in Section 4, where
we use the age as derived in Section 4.3. Finally, we
discuss the results in Section 5 and summarize our con-
clusions in Section 6.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE; Bacon
et al. 2010) observations of SNR 0540 were taken as part
of ESO program 0102.D-0769, utilizing the wide-ﬁeld
mode adaptive optics (WFM-AO). The instrument was
used in extended mode, which provides a slightly bluer
wavelength cutoﬀ, allowing for the capture of Hβ. Ob-
servations were split into four observing blocks between
January and March 2019, with each block consisting of
3 × 770 s exposures. A 230 s exposure was taken imme-
diately after each block at an oﬀset of a few arcminutes
for the purposes of sky subtraction. The ﬁnal science
exposure of the second observing block was not used
as image quality deteriorated during this time, result-
ing in a total exposure time of ∼ 2.35 h. The reduced

et al. (2005) can be found in Lundqvist et al. (2021).

data were retrieved from ESO Phase 3 data products,
having been reduced with MUSE reduction pipeline ver-
sion 2.6.2. The MUSE WFM-AO observations provide
integral-ﬁeld spectroscopic observations covering a 1(cid:48)×1(cid:48)
FOV at a spatial resolution of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 − 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 with 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 sam-
pling. The observations cover the wavelength range
4650–9300 ˚A (with a gap between 5760–6010 ˚A due to
the Na laser) at a spectral resolution of 1750–3750.

X-shooter observations of SNR 0540 were performed
between 23 October and 2 November 2019 as a part of
ESO program 0104.D-0532. The instrument has three
arms (UVB, VIS and NIR), which together cover the
wavelength interval 3000−25, 000 ˚A. We used slit widths
of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 (UVB), 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 (VIS) and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 (NIR), which provide a
spectral resolution of 3200, 5000 and 4300, respectively.
The orientation of the slit is shown in Figure 1. The see-
ing during the observations was 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)8−1(cid:48)(cid:48) and the airmass
was 1.5.

The observations were performed as a nodding pattern
in six observing blocks, with each block containing four
exposures of 280, 190 and 300 s in UVB, VIS and NIR,
respectively. SNR 0540 is too large to ﬁt within twice
the 11(cid:48)(cid:48) slit length. Thus, although we nodded along the
slit, the data were not reduced as a nodding sequence,
as that would have resulted in subtraction of ﬂux from
the outer regions of the remnant. The data were in-
stead reduced in STARE mode using the standard ESO
pipeline, followed by shifting and adding the individual
STARE observations. Sky subtraction was undertaken
using the ﬂux at the edges of the slits in the combined
frame. We also checked that individual frames could be
sky subtracted followed by the combination with minor
diﬀerences from the adopted sequence described above.
In the UVB and VIS, we did not perform sky subtrac-
tion of the narrow lines from the interstellar medium
(ISM) that overlap with the broad ejecta lines. As de-
scribed in Section 3, we were able to remove these lines
more accurately by ﬁtting the spectra at each position
along the slit. The normal nodding observing sequence
would automatically compensate for bad pixels while si-
multaneously sky-subtracting. In our case, and for the
NIR arm in particular, bad pixels were identiﬁed and
corrected by interpolation using adjacent pixels before
combining the frames.

the ejecta.

addition to these lines, we analyze Hβ in both data
sets. While this line has a relatively low signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N), it provides important information about
the ejecta and also help us interpret the Hα emission,
which suﬀers from blending with strong emission from
[N II] λλ6548, 6584. We focus on the morphology of the
diﬀerent lines and do not correct the spectra for redden-
ing.

SNR 0540 is surrounded by a complex ISM that pro-
duces narrow emission lines. The centroid velocity and
width of these lines vary with position and line species.
In the following we correct all spectra for the average
systemic velocity of the ISM near the center of the rem-
nant, which we determine to be 277 km s−1 in both data
sets independently. The standard deviation about the
average velocity is 1.5 and 6.5 km s−1 for the dozen dif-
ferent lines ﬁtted in X-shooter and MUSE, respectively.
We also take 277 km s−1 as the center of explosion
along the line of sight when creating 3D maps. In the
image plane, we take the pulsar position as the center of
the explosion. This is a reasonable approximation given
the upper limit on the transverse velocity of the pulsar
of < 250 km s−1 (Mignani et al. 2010). We translate
distances from the pulsar to ejecta velocities assuming a
free expansion and an age of 1100 years (Section 4.3.2).
For a distance to the LMC of 49.6 kpc (Pietrzy´nski et al.
2019), this age implies that 1(cid:48)(cid:48) (0.24 pc) corresponds to
214 km s−1.

In order to isolate the emission from the ejecta, it
is necessary to subtract the continuum emission from
the pulsar, PWN and nearby stars, as well as the
narrow line emission from the ISM. For the MUSE
data cube, we perform the subtraction based on ﬁts
to the spectra in each spatial pixel. First, the con-
tinuum level was determined by ﬁtting straight lines
to ∼ 1000 km s−1 intervals on both sides of each line.
The contribution from the ISM was then determined
by ﬁtting a Gaussian plus a straight line to the cen-
tral part of the continuum-subtracted spectra (between
∼ ±130 − 250 km s−1 for the diﬀerent lines, considering
the wavelength-dependence of the spectral resolution).
The reason for removing ISM lines by ﬁtting is the
signiﬁcant variations of these lines across the remnant,
which implies that simply subtracting a background
spectrum usually leaves large residuals. In pixels where
the ﬁt to the ISM lines failed or returned unreason-
able values, we used ﬁt parameters obtained from back-
ground spectra. In these cases, we ﬁxed the centroid and
width of the Gaussian to the background values and ad-
justed only the normalization to subtract the line. The
approximation of the ejecta proﬁle by a straight line over
the narrow velocity intervals used in these ﬁts is good in

most cases. However, it clearly introduces a systematic
uncertainty that should be kept in mind when interpret-
ing the results at low Doppler shifts.

The wavelength intervals covered by some ejecta lines
also include other weak ISM lines, such as He I λ5016
overlapping with the [O III] proﬁle. These were removed
in a similar way as described above. The data cubes were
carefully inspected after the subtractions to identify any
residuals not associated with ejecta. This revealed some
signs of ISM interaction (including the western “F1” re-
gion studied in Seraﬁmovich et al. 2005) and problems
with a small number of stars. While most stellar spec-
tra are reasonably well described by straight lines over
the narrow wavelength ranges considered here, there are
exceptions, such as stars exhibiting strong absorption in
Hβ. Problematic ISM regions and stars were masked
out or dealt with in a custom manner (e.g., by adjusting
the wavelength interval of the continuum ﬁts or applying
sigma-clipping in the region of some stars). We veriﬁed
that there was no confusion with signiﬁcant signal from
the ejecta when masking out problematic regions.

Sandin et al. (2013). We will investigate possible spatial
variations of this line ratio in future work. We do not at-
tempt to deblend the Hα+[N II] complex, but note that
the overlap between these lines in wavelength space is
relatively small in the X-shooter spectra. Finally, for 3D
visualization purposes, we remap the cleaned cubes for
all lines to a uniform grid with a spacing of 40 km s−1.
For X-shooter data, we ﬁt and subtract the contin-
uum in each row of the 2D spectra, analogous to the
procedure used for MUSE. The narrow ISM lines in the
UVB and VIS were also removed as for MUSE, using
ﬁts with Gaussians. This method leaves clear residuals
inside ∼ ±150 km s−1, but nevertheless produces sig-
niﬁcantly better results than simply subtracting back-
ground spectra from the edges of the slits. On the other
hand, the narrow lines in the NIR were best removed
using standard background subtraction. In the NIR we
also removed some remaining bad pixels in the [Fe II]
wavelength region using a sigma-clipping routine.

4. RESULTS

The ejecta of SNR 0540 are composed of several com-
plex emission components. Below we ﬁrst give a general
overview of the main observed features in the innermost
region ((cid:46) 4(cid:48)(cid:48)) in Section 4.1 and on more extended scales
(4 − 17(cid:48)(cid:48)) in Section 4.2. A more detailed analysis of the

from the pulsar in the plane of the sky. Images of emission lines were produced by summing the cleaned cubes over the full
spectral region where signiﬁcant ejecta emission is detected. The Hβ image in the bottom left panel shows some dark areas
outside the ejecta region due to residuals from the removal of stars. The location of stars can be seen in the continuum image
(obtained around 5300 ˚A) in the third panel, bottom row. The positions of the pulsar and a bright blob in the PWN are
indicated by arrows in this image, while the dashed black lines show the 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 wide X-shooter slit. The bright spot located
just below the lower dashed line near the PWN blob is due to two blended stars. The continuum is also shown as contours
superposed on the [O III] image in the bottom right panel.

morphology, as well as an age estimate, are presented in
Section 4.3.

4.1. Inner region

The strongest line emission from the ejecta is con-
centrated to a small region within a radius ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48)
(850 km s−1) from the pulsar. This is illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, which shows 2D images of the innermost region
obtained by summing the cleaned MUSE data cubes for
all emission lines. The morphology of the ejecta is dom-
inated by clumpy ring structures, which are similar in
all lines, though there are some diﬀerences on a more
detailed level. The most notable diﬀerence is that the
[O III] is slightly more extended in the eastern and west-
ern directions. A continuum image is also included in
Figure 1 for comparison. This shows that the line and
continuum emission from the PWN overlap in projec-
tion, but that the brightest regions are slightly oﬀset
(see comparison between [O III] and continuum in the
lower right panel, see also Lundqvist et al. 2011). The
properties of the continuum emission will be presented
in a separate paper (L. Tenhu et al., in preparation).

We present 3D plots of the inner emission in Figure 2.
The plots show iso-surfaces corresponding to 40% of the
peak intensity for each line, which means that only the
brightest structures are seen. The 3D view reveals the
ring morphology more clearly than the images and fur-

ther highlights the similarity between the diﬀerent lines.
The 3D morphology of fainter emission in this region is
illustrated in Figure 3. We show only the lines with the
best data quality ([O III], [S III] and [Ar III]), omitting
Hβ due low S/N and [S II] due to uncertainties from
deblending of the doublet. The plots in Figure 3 show
semi-transparent iso-surfaces corresponding to 10% of
the peak intensity together with the iso-surfaces from
Figure 2. The faint emission includes a red tail of [Ar III]
that extends to ∼ 2000 km s−1 near the center of the
remnant. The other lines do not show this tail, though
we note that we cannot draw ﬁrm conclusions regarding
faint redshifted emission in [S III] due to a higher noise
level at these wavelengths.

Additional information about the morphology of the
inner ejecta is provided by the X-shooter 2D spectra in
Figure 4. These spectra represent a slice through the
full 3D maps, as illustrated in Figure 3. We veriﬁed
that MUSE and X-shooter give consistent results by ex-
tracting a 2D spectrum of [O III] from MUSE along the
X-shooter slit (Figure 4, left panel). The X-shooter ve-
locity maps reveal clumpy ring structures, as expected,
with a similar morphology in all lines. This includes
[O II] and [Fe II], which are not covered by the MUSE
observations. The [O II] distribution is slightly more
smooth due to blending of the two components of the
doublet, which are separated by 224 km s−1. For [Fe II],

version of the third panel is available. The video shows one rotation.

we show the 12567 ˚A line due to its good spectral qual-
ity, but note that the 16443 ˚A line has a fully consistent
morphology.

The higher spectral resolution of X-shooter also al-
lows us to unambiguously identify Hα emission in the
inner region (Figure 4, right panel). A contribution
from [N II] λλ6548, 6584 can be seen on either side of
the Hα line, with the 6584 ˚A component having a sim-
ilar strength as Hα (see also Morse et al. 2006). The
overall morphology of the [N II] emission is consistent
with that seen in the other lines. As for MUSE, the
X-shooter data reveal some diﬀerences between the dif-

ferent lines on a more detailed level. The most obvious
diﬀerence is stronger [O III] and [O II] at the highest
redshifts, with the O emission region centered around
Vz, Vslit = (950, −150) km s−1 being signiﬁcantly fainter
in the other lines.

4.2. Extended emission

We identify spatially extended emission associated
with SNR 0540 in [O III], Hα and Hβ. This is illus-
trated by the images in Figure 5, which were obtained
by summing the cleaned MUSE data cubes of the three
lines over the central 33(cid:48)(cid:48) × 33(cid:48)(cid:48) region. The FOV corre-

center of explosion along the slit, while Vz is the velocity along the line of sight. The slit orientation (Figures 1 and 3) means
that Vslit is related to Vx and Vy in the 3D maps as Vslit = −(2/
3)Vx = 2Vy. The [O III] contours in the upper left panel
represent MUSE data extracted from the region covered by the slit, illustrating the good agreement between the two data sets.
The [O II] λλ3726, 3729 doublet in the next panel is centered on the 2nd component. The emission regions labeled A-F in the
lower left panel are used for the measurements in Section 4.3.3. The images have been stretched in the spatial direction (along
Vslit) in order to give a uniform velocity scale for the assumed age of the remnant.

sponds to maximal velocities of 3500 km s−1 in the plane
of the sky, while we only include Doppler shifts within
±2500 km s−1. No signiﬁcant emission is detected at
higher or lower Doppler shifts, though we note that faint,
highly red- or blueshifted emission is more challenging
to detect if blended with other lines. The cube contain-
ing Hα has a strong contribution from [N II] in the inner
region, but this is not present in the extended emission,
as explained further below.

In the case of [O III], the emission forms a faint halo
that extends to ∼ 10 − 14(cid:48)(cid:48) in diﬀerent directions. There
is some uncertainty in the maximal extent of the weak-
est emission due to the complex ISM (discussed further
in Section 4.3.3), but these observations clearly allow
us to trace the emission beyond the previously reported
∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48) radius (e.g., Morse et al. 2006). With MUSE we
can also investigate the 3D morphology of this emission,
which is shown in Figure 6. The iso-surface in this plot
represents only 3% of the peak intensity of the line. We
ﬁnd that this emission forms a ring-like structure sur-
rounding the inner ejecta. The ring extends outwards

from ∼ 1000 km s−1 and is inclined by ∼ 40◦ with re-
spect to the line of sight. The geometry of this structure
is quantiﬁed further in Section 4.3, where we also use it
to estimate the kinematic age of the remnant.

The extended emission in the Balmer lines is markedly
diﬀerent from the [O III] emission. It is characterized by
a large blob extended between ∼ 8 − 14(cid:48)(cid:48) southeast of
the center (Figure 5). A spectrum extracted from this
region is shown in Figure 7, revealing a broad hump of
blueshifted emission extending to −1600 km s−1. The
Hα and Hβ proﬁles show excellent agreement, which im-
plies that there is no signiﬁcant [N II] emission blended
with Hα in this region. Figure 7 also shows the spectrum
of [O III] extracted from the same region for comparison.
This line is clearly diﬀerent, showing more emission at
redshifted velocities. The relation between the extended
[O III] and H emission is further illustrated by the 3D
plot in Figure 8, which shows that the H-blob is located
in front of the [O III] emission with respect to the ob-
server. The [O III] emission in Figure 7 is part of the
tilted ring structure in Figure 8.

emission, while the other two images have linear color maps. The Hα+[N II] and Hβ images show a bright emission region in
the southeast in addition to the clumpy ring structures in the central region. All other features in these two images are due to
residuals from imperfect subtraction of stars and narrow ISM lines. Three circles are plotted for reference to indicate the scale.
They have radii of 3.6, 7.8 and 14.4(cid:48)(cid:48), which corresponds to ∼ 800, 1700 and 3100 km s−1, respectively, for an age of 1100 years.
An elliptical aperture used for extracting spectra in the region of the H-blob is shown by the black/white line.

4.3. Analysis of ejecta geometry and age estimate

4.3.1. Identiﬁcation of clumps

In this Section we analyze the distribution of ejecta
emission in more detail. We use a clump-ﬁnding al-
gorithm to identify clumps in the 3D cubes (Sec-
tion 4.3.1), which we use to estimate the age of the
remnant (Section 4.3.2) and to quantify the morphology
(Section 4.3.3).
In Section 4.3.3, we also present full
velocity distributions for the diﬀerent emission lines in
MUSE data and provide measures of clump separations
and sizes for X-shooter data. All analysis on MUSE
data is performed using the original sampling of the
cubes, i.e. without the interpolation used for visualizing
3D iso-surfaces above.

We use the FellWalker algorithm (Berry 2015) to iden-
tify clumps, as implemented in the Starlink CUPID2
package (Berry et al. 2007), which we run using a Python
wrapper.3 The algorithm works by performing “walks”
through the data cube,
following the path with the
steepest gradient until a signiﬁcant peak is reached. All
pixels along paths that reach the same peak are assigned
to the same clump. In this way, each pixel that is above
a given constant threshold gets assigned to a unique
clump. Advantages of this algorithm are that clumps
can have any shape and that the results are relatively

We run the clump-ﬁnding on the cleaned MUSE data
cubes of [S II], [S III], [Ar III], Hβ and [O III]. The al-
gorithm works in pixel space without any assumptions
about how the pixel coordinates translate to ejecta ve-
locity. The values of several of the input parameters are
given in units of the root-mean-square (RMS) noise of
the cubes, which we measure in background regions for
each line. We set the threshold value, below which pix-
els are not assigned to clumps (the noise parameter), to
3×RMS, while the largest dip between two peaks that
are considered to belong to the same clump (mindip) is
set to its default value of 2×RMS. The resolution in the
cube is approximately 3.5 pixels (in terms of full width at
half maximum, FWHM) in both the spatial and spectral
directions. In view of this, we set the minimum number
of pixels that a clump can contain (minpix) to 43 pix-
els and the maxjump parameter to 3 pixels. The latter
means that a cube with sides of 6 pixels is searched for
higher pixel values when a local maximum is reached,
preventing noise spikes on small scales from being inter-
preted as clumps. All other input parameters are set to
their default values.

We compared the resulting clump assignment with 3D
plots of the emission in each line, using both 3D scat-
ter plots and iso-surfaces like those shown in Figure 2,
ensuring that no noise spikes or other spurious features
were assigned as clumps. Following this inspection, we
manually rejected some clumps clearly associated with
residuals from the ISM subtraction in the case of [O III],
as well as some clumps at high velocities in [S II] that
we associate with residuals from deblending of the dou-
blet. All remaining clumps were analyzed using the ﬁnd-
clumps command of the CUPID package, which provides
information about the positions, sizes and ﬂuxes of the
clumps.

4.3.2. Age estimate

We use the clumps identiﬁed above to estimate a kine-
matic age for the remnant. As a ﬁrst step, we trans-
late the pixel coordinates of the peak position of each
clump to Doppler velocities (vD) and projected distances
(rp) from the assumed center (see Section 3). Fitting a
semi-circle to the distribution of these observables for
knots of ejecta oﬀers a way to estimate the age, as pre-
viously done for Cas A (e.g, DeLaney et al. 2010) and
N132D (Law et al. 2020). The method assumes freely
expanding, spherically symmetric ejecta. Inspection of
our clump positions in Figure 9 shows that the inner
region (inside rp < 4(cid:48)(cid:48)) is clearly asymmetric and thus
ill-suited for such an estimate. These inner clumps are
also likely to have been aﬀected by acceleration by the
pulsar wind. On the other hand, the majority of the

Figure 7. MUSE spectra extracted from the elliptical aper-
ture shown in Figure 5, covering the Hα+Hβ emission region
in the southeast. The spectrum of [O III] from the same re-
gion is also shown for comparison. The removal of narrow
lines from the ISM introduces uncertainties at the lowest ve-
locities, clearly seen in the Hα and [O III] proﬁles.

high-velocity blob of H and its relation to the extended [O III]
emission. The turquoise surface corresponds to 30% of the
peak Hβ emission. The semi-transparent red surface shows
the Hα emission in the southeastern part of the remnant.
The gray surface is the same as in the middle panel of Fig-
ure 6, showing the [O III] emission outside 1300 km s−1. The
red ring is the same as in Figure 6. The coordinate axes are
deﬁned as in Figure 2. An animated (rotating) version of
this ﬁgure is available. The video shows one rotation.

insensitive to the exact values of the input parameters
(Berry 2015). On the other hand, the method does not
account for possible overlap between clumps or hierar-
chical structures.

age of 1122 ± 140 years and a radius corresponding to
1646 ± 231 km s−1.

We have also performed the ﬁts after varying the input
parameters for the clump-ﬁnding algorithm (in partic-
ular the maxjump and mindip parameters, which aﬀect
the number of clumps identiﬁed). This results in best-ﬁt
ages that are within the statistical uncertainties quoted
above. The main observational uncertainty aﬀecting the
age estimate is the ISM subtraction, which prevents us
from accurately deﬁning clumps with vD ∼ 0 km s−1.
There is also a systematic uncertainty in this age esti-
mate arising from potential deceleration due to inter-
action or acceleration by the PWN (see e.g., Banovetz
et al. 2021, for a relevant discussion).

Considering these uncertainties, we take 1100 years
as the age for SNR 0540. This is in line with pre-
vious kinematic age estimates, which are in the range
800−1200 years (Kirshner et al. 1989; Morse et al. 2006).
Those estimates were obtained by comparing the extent
of the emission in images with the Doppler shifts in spec-
tra. The spin-down age of the pulsar is somewhat higher
at ∼ 1660 years (Seward et al. 1984).

4.3.3. Properties of clumps and rings

The characteristic velocities of the main components
of the ejecta are summarized in Table 1, with further de-
tails provided in the text below. All velocities quoted are
3D velocities measured from the assumed center of ex-
plosion for an age of 1100 years, unless otherwise stated.
To quantify the full velocity distribution of the ob-
served emission, we sum the ﬂux in the MUSE data
cubes in spherical shells of 200 km s−1 width, start-
ing at 50 km s−1. The width of the bins was se-
lected considering the resolution, which corresponds to
FWHM ∼ 150 km s−1 in the spatial direction and ranges
from FWHM ∼ 90 at [S III] to ∼ 170 km s−1 at Hβ. We
only include pixels with ﬂux values > 3×RMS above
the background. The left panel of Figure 10 shows the
ﬂux in each shell divided by its volume. The proﬁles are
completely dominated by the inner part, with all lines
peaking in the velocity bin that covers 250−450 km s−1.
The proﬁles of [Ar III], [S II] and [S III] fall oﬀ similarly
with increasing velocity, reaching ∼ 1200 km s−1, while
[O III] shows more emission at higher velocities, with a
tail extending to just over 2000 km s−1. The Hβ proﬁle
is narrower than the other lines, with a higher ﬂux per
volume in the innermost bin. This is likely inﬂuenced
by the lower S/N and lower spectral resolution for this
line. The high-velocity blob of Hβ is not noticeable in
this proﬁle because it occupies a small part of the total
volume of the outer shells.

Figure 9. Distribution of vD and rp for the peaks of the
clumps identiﬁed in MUSE data by the FellWalker algorithm.
The black line is the best-ﬁt semi-circle used for the age
estimate. It was ﬁtted to the [O III] clumps shown as ﬁlled
green circles. The [O III] clumps not included in the ﬁt are
shown with open symbols.

clumps in the extended [O III] emission approximately
follow a semi-circle, as also expected from the ring-like
structure seen in Figure 6. We select the [O III] clumps
located between 4(cid:48)(cid:48) < rp < 9(cid:48)(cid:48) (ﬁlled green circles in
Figure 9) and ﬁt them using the following expression
(adapted from DeLaney et al. 2010):

(cid:17)2

(cid:16) rp
s

+ (vD − vc)2 = (vmax − vc)2 ,

(1)

where the ﬁt parameters are the central Doppler shift of
the semi-circle (vc), the maximal velocity when rp = 0
(vmax) and the scale factor (s), which translates the rp
to a velocity.

The resulting ﬁt is shown as a black line Figure 9. The
best-ﬁt values are s = 4.87 ± 0.50 × 10−3 (cid:48)(cid:48)/(km s−1),
vc = −4±63 km s−1 and vmax = 1558±158 km s−1, with
the latter two giving a radius of 1562 ± 170 km s−1. The
scale factor can be translated to an age by combining it
with the fact that 1(cid:48)(cid:48) corresponds to 7.42 × 1012 km at
the distance of the LMC (49.6 kpc, Pietrzy´nski et al.
2019). This gives an age of 1146 ± 116 years. For
comparison, performing the ﬁt using the positions of
the clump centroids instead of their peaks gives an

Figure 10. Measures of ejecta brightness as a function of velocity for diﬀerent emission lines. The ﬂuxes in each line were
summed in spherical shells of 200 km s−1 width, shown as horizontal error bars. Left: Proﬁles showing the ﬂux divided by the
volume of each shell. Right: Corresponding proﬁles without dividing by the volume. This gives more weight to the outer shells,
highlighting the velocity distribution of the extended emission. Note the diﬀerent extent on the x-axis in the two panels. The
analysis was performed on MUSE data, which is also the case for all other ﬁgures presented in this Section (Figures 11 - 14).

Figure 11. Flux proﬁles in diﬀerent directions for [Ar III] (left), [O III] (middle) and Hβ (right). The ﬂuxes were summed in
shells of 200 km s−1 width in the directions indicated by the labels, with “near” and “far” indicating blueshifted and redshifted
emission, respectively. The shells are the same ones indicated by the horizontal error bars in Figure 10. The sum of all directions
are shown in the right panel of Figure 10. Note the diﬀerent extent on the x-axis in the three panels.

The H-blob is instead clearly seen in the right panel
of Figure 10, where the ﬂux in each shell has not been
normalized by volume. This shows that the emission in
the blob extends from ∼ 1500 − 3500 km s−1. The same
plot also shows [O III] extending to ∼ 3000 km s−1 and
a faint tail of [Ar III] reaching ∼ 2000 km s−1 (the small
bump in [S II] at this velocity is aﬀected by residuals
from deblending of the doublet).

Figure 11 shows the ﬂux proﬁles of [Ar III], [O III] and
Hβ divided into eight directions, which provides infor-
mation about the asymmetries. In the inner regions, all
lines show a general trend of higher ﬂuxes and higher
velocities on the redshifted side; the magnitude of the
peaks on the red- and blueshifted sides diﬀer by up to
a factor of 5 and the positions of the peaks diﬀer by
up to 400 km s−1. The two S lines (not shown) exhibit
the same trends. Outside the inner region, the [O III]
proﬁles show clear bumps at high velocities (peaking

at ∼ 1600 − 1700 km s−1) in the north-blueshifted and
south-redshifted directions, which are associated with
the extended ring-like structure seen in Figure 6. The
ﬂux at these velocities is a factor 7 higher in the south
than in the north on the redshifted side, while it is a
factor 2 higher in the north than in the south on the
blueshifted side, which gives a measure of how pro-
nounced the ring is. Finally, the Hβ proﬁles show a
bright peak corresponding to the blueshifted blob in the
southeast, but there is no corresponding emission in any
other direction.

It is interesting to compare these ﬂux proﬁles with the
distribution of clumps identiﬁed by the clump-ﬁnding al-
gorithm. A similar number of clumps (21–25) were ob-
tained for [S II], [S III] and [Ar III], a total of 52 clumps
were obtained for [O III] due to the added contribution
from the extended emission, while only 12 clumps were
identiﬁed in Hβ due to the lower S/N. The left panel

line. The distributions are broad, as expected from the
fact that we see structures on several diﬀerent scales in
the 3D plots. To estimate the typical size of the small
rings in the inner region, we determine the distance be-
tween clumps located on opposite sides of the blueshifted
ring in the southwest of the ejecta (this is the most well-
deﬁned ring, clearly seen in Figure 2). We also measure
the distance between clumps on opposite sides of the

tions are simply taken as the peaks in the 2D spectra
shown in Figure 4. The results of these measurements
are summarized in Table 1, showing that the typical di-
ameter of the small rings are ∼ 500 − 600 km s−1. As
an approximate measure of the size of the inner cavity,
we identify the peak of the emissivity in diﬀerent direc-
tions for [Ar III] (as in the left panel of Figure 11, but
normalized by volume). The peaks are in the bins cen-
tered at 550 km s−1 in the southwest and northeast on
the redshifted side, at 150 km s−1 in the southeast and
northeast on the blueshifted side, and at 350 km s−1 in
the remaining four directions.

The clumps deﬁned by the FellWalker algorithm have
irregular shapes. As an approximate measure of their
sizes, we use the RMS size in each direction, as pro-
vided by the ﬁndclumps command in CUPID. This cor-
responds to the standard deviation for the ideal case of
a clump with a Gaussian proﬁle. To be able to directly
compare the size estimates in diﬀerent lines, we subtract
the resolution in quadrature from the RMS size in each
dimension. The relevant resolutions are 1/2.35 of the
FWHM values provided at the beginning of this sub-
section. In ∼ 5% of all clumps, the RMS returned by
ﬁndclumps is smaller than the resolution, which we deal
with by setting the relevant RMS to the value of the
resolution. There are no systematic diﬀerences between

The plotted sizes are the averages of the RMS sizes in the
three dimensions (Vx, Vy and Vz), deconvolved with the reso-
lution (see text for details). The smallest clump sizes deﬁned

of Figure 12 shows the distributions of velocities for the
clump positions (deﬁned as the location of the peak ﬂux
of each clump). All emission lines show a concentra-
tion of clump positions in the range 300 − 800 km s−1,
which is comparable to the main peak of the ﬂux pro-
ﬁles. In the case of [O III], there is a prominent peak in
the clump distribution at 1600 km s−1, corresponding
to the extended ring, as well as a tail of clumps reaching
a maximal velocity of 2400 km s−1. For Hβ, the clump-
ﬁnding algorithm identiﬁes three clumps with compara-
ble peak ﬂuxes in the high-velocity H blob, with centers
at 2300, 2440 and 2860 km s−1, respectively (see Table 1
for details).

central part, has a value of 1). The error bars represent the RMS sizes of the clumps in the diﬀerent directions (omitted for the

the sizes in the three dimensions and we therefore show
the average values in Figure 13.

The clump sizes measured in this way are ∼ 60 −
200 km s−1 for all lines with the exception of [O III],
which shows clump sizes extending up to 330 km s−1.
There are no systematic diﬀerences between the sizes of
[O III] clumps in the inner and outer regions, as shown in
Table 1. We caution that this is a rather crude estimate
of the size of the irregular clumps and that the clump
sizes are more sensitive to the input parameters of the
clump-ﬁnding algorithm than the distribution of clump
positions. To provide another measure of the clump
sizes, we also ﬁt Gaussians to the X-shooter spectra of
the clumps, focusing on [Fe II] and Hα, which oﬀer the
best spectral resolution. These results are summarized
in Table 1, showing that the smallest clump is unresolved
at ∼ 30 km s−1.

We investigate the properties of the clumps in the ex-
tended [O III] emission in more detail in Figure 14, which
shows the projected positions of the clumps in the plane
of the sky and as seen from the side. The sizes and ﬂuxes
of the clumps located outside 4(cid:48)(cid:48) are also indicated in
the ﬁgure. This illustrates that the extended emission
is more complex than a simple ring or torus, as also ev-
ident from several previous plots (e.g., Figures 6, 8 and
9). In particular, there are a number of clumps in the
south that fall below the plane of the ring, some of which
are on the blueshifted side. It is notable that the clumps
located furthest from the ring have low ﬂuxes and small
sizes. This also agrees with Figure 11 (middle panel),
which shows peaks in the ﬂux proﬁles at high velocities
only in the north-blueshifted and south-redshifted direc-
tions, i.e. along the plane of the ring. From inspection

of the full 3D maps, it is clear that the clumps located
away from the ring are not noise spikes. On the other
hand, it is likely that the exact positions of some of these
clumps are aﬀected by uncertainties due to the removal
of narrow lines from the surrounding medium.

As an example, the clump located furthest to the
east with Vx, Vy = (−2350, −240) km s−1 (Figure 14)
overlaps with a highly complex region of the ISM.
The Doppler shift of its brightest point is only Vz =
260 km s−1, which is likely aﬀected by contamination
from the ISM. However, the clump extends to redshifts
of ∼ 1000 km s−1, with a peak at ∼ 500 km s−1 in
its integrated line proﬁle, showing a clear association
with SNR 0540. To obtain a conservative measure of
the highest-velocity [O III] associated with the rem-
nant, we investigate the velocity distribution of all pix-
els assigned to clumps after excluding positions with
|Vz| < 500 km s−1. We ﬁnd that this distribution ex-
tends to 3000 km s−1, consistent with the ﬂux proﬁles
in Figures 10 and 11.

To obtain an approximate estimate of the inclination
of the main ring, we ﬁt a straight line to the Vz − Vy
positions of all the clumps that have peak ﬂuxes above
a threshold of 0.05 in normalized units. The exact value
of the ﬂux cutoﬀ is somewhat arbitrary, but motivated
by the fact that most of the faintest clumps do not follow
the main ring structure. The best-ﬁt line has a slope of
−1.1±0.2 (Figure 14, right panel), which corresponds to
an inclination of 42◦. This estimate is clearly dependent
on which clumps are included in the ﬁt, but we note
that an inclination of 40◦ gives a good visual agreement
with the 3D contours seen in Figure 6 (red circle in that
ﬁgure).

5. DISCUSSION

The 3D distribution of ejecta in SNe carry information
about the progenitor star and the explosion mechanism,
as shown by numerical simulations (e.g., Gabler et al.
2021; Orlando et al. 2021). Reconstructed 3D maps of
ejecta emission therefore oﬀer a powerful way of eval-
uating theoretical models, though the observations will
of course also be aﬀected by the relevant energy sources
and resulting ionization structures. Below we discuss
these eﬀects and the interpretation of the observations of
the innermost region (Section 5.1), the extended [O III]
emission (Section 5.2) and the H-blob (Section 5.3), be-
fore ﬁnally placing SNR 0540 in the context of other
SNRs in Section 5.4.

5.1. The innermost region

The emission in the inner region of SNR 0540 is pow-
ered by the PWN. In particular, the ejecta located inside
∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48) are expected to be shocked by the pulsar wind (e.g.,
Williams et al. 2008). This is supported by our detec-
tion of [Fe II], which is a shock-tracer. We ﬁnd typical
velocities of ∼ 500 km s−1 in this region, assuming freely

expanding ejecta. Williams et al. (2008) estimate a ve-
locity of 20 km s−1 for the shocks in the dense clumps,
which is small compared to the free-expansion speeds.
The observations show that the morphology in this re-
gion is broadly similar in all lines, including diﬀerent
ionization states of the same element. This indicates
that the rings and clumps likely reﬂect the true density
distribution of ejecta, rather than variations in temper-
ature and ionization level.

On a more detailed level, there are some diﬀerences
between the diﬀerent emission lines. The most notable
diﬀerences in the MUSE observations are between [O III]
compared to [S II], [S III] and [Ar III]. We ﬁnd that the
rings extend to higher velocities in [O III] (by up to
∼ 200 km s−1 in some directions, Figures 1, 2, 10), that
[O III] has larger maximal clump sizes (Figure 13), and
also lacks the faint red tail seen in [Ar III] (Figure 3,
where the S lines are uncertain). These diﬀerences may
reﬂect the origin in diﬀerent nuclear burning zones of
the progenitor, with S and Ar being located further in
(as part of the the Si/S layer) than O. While these layers
have been mixed in the explosion, the small signiﬁcant

14

Larsson et al.

diﬀerences between the lines indicate that some of the
original structure has been retained. Similar conclusions
have previously been reached for Cas A, where infrared
observation of the ejecta interior to the reverse shock
show diﬀerences between O and Si in some locations
(Isensee et al. 2010).

Cas A also shows Fe-rich ejecta that extend beyond
S-rich ejecta (Hughes et al. 2000; Milisavljevic & Fesen
2013), which simulations explain as ﬁngers of Fe ejecta
pushing through the lower-density Si/S layer (Orlando
et al. 2021). Our X-shooter observations show no indi-
cation of such inversion, with [Fe II] and [S III] having
very similar distributions, which are slightly diﬀerent
from [O III] on the redshifted side (Figure 4). A likely
reason for this diﬀerence between SNR 0540 and Cas A
is that the inversion of layers in Cas A was enhanced by
the passage of the reverse shock (Orlando et al. 2021).
The mixing of diﬀerent elements observed in the inner
region of SNR 0540 is not solely due to the explosion,
but is also expected to have been enhanced as a result
of low-velocity (and low-density) ejecta being swept up
by the PWN shock. However, this process clearly only
operates in the outward direction, which leads us to con-
clude that elements that originate further out in the pro-
genitor, including H, must have been mixed down to ve-
locities of only a few 100 km s−1 in the explosion itself.
Similarly low velocities for H have been observed also
in SN 1987A (Kozma & Fransson 1998; Larsson et al.
2019) and reproduced in simulations of neutrino-driven
explosions (Utrobin et al. 2019).

Simulations also predict the presence of so-called Ni
bubbles, where the radioactive decay of 56Ni pushes the
ejecta outward, compressing them into a denser shell (Li
et al. 1993; Blondin et al. 2001; Gabler et al. 2021; Or-
lando et al. 2021). This process may help explain the
observed morphology of the inner ejecta in SNR 0540, as
bubbles intersected by the pulsar shock would manifest
as rings in the observations. In this interpretation, the
observed ring diameters of ∼ 500−600 km s−1 (Table 1)
provide a measure of the size of Ni bubbles in the inner-
most region. The shell of a Ni bubble is expected to be
clumpy (Basko 1994) and this clumpy structure will be
further enhanced by fragmentation resulting from the
interaction with the shock (Williams et al. 2008), which
agrees with our observation of clumpy rings. The Ni
bubbles are expected to be ﬁlled with Fe (the decay
product of Ni), so the fact that we observe [Fe II] emis-
sion in the clumpy rings rather than in the interior of
the rings (Figure 4), is consistent with a picture where
the shock has swept up the material inside the bubbles.
In addition to the small-scale asymmetries in the form
of rings and clumps, the inner ejecta of SNR 0540 show

a global asymmetry in the sense that the redshifted
ejecta have higher ﬂuxes and higher velocities than the
blueshifted side. This has been noted in previous obser-
vations (Kirshner et al. 1989; Seraﬁmovich et al. 2005;
Morse et al. 2006; Sandin et al. 2013) and is likely caused
by asymmetries in the explosion and/or the energy input
from the pulsar. Net motion of the progenitor relative
to the local ISM may also play a role in explaining this
asymmetry, as originally discussed by Kirshner et al.
(1989). However, this is unlikely to be the dominant
eﬀect, as the oﬀset is up to ∼ 400 km s−1 (Figure 11),
implying that the progenitor would have been unbound
from the LMC.

5.2. The extended [O III] emission

The MUSE observation has allowed us to character-
ize the [O III] emission that surrounds the inner neb-
ula in unprecedented detail. The faintest emission can
be traced to velocities of ∼ 3000 km s−1, but we ﬁnd
that the emission is dominated by an irregular ring-like
structure with a radius of ∼ 1600 km s−1 and inclination
∼ 40◦. Using clumps in this ring, we obtain an estimate
of the age of the remnant of 1100 years. This agrees rea-
sonably well with the spin-down age of ∼ 1660 years for
the pulsar (Seward et al. 1984), providing evidence that
the [O III] emission most likely originates from freely ex-
panding SN ejecta rather than pre-explosion mass loss.
Furthermore, the [O III]-emitting material is likely to be
photoionized by the synchrotron emission and radiative
shocks of the PWN (Williams et al. 2008), implying that
the observed velocities have not been altered by shock
interaction.

If the [O III] ring were part of the CSM, the observed
properties would point to an eruptive mass-loss event
with high velocity shortly before the explosion. Erup-
tions from luminous blue variable stars can reach ve-
locities > 1000 km s−1 in some cases (e.g., Smith 2008;
Smith et al. 2011), but the typical progenitors are very
massive (> 20 M(cid:12)), which is unlikely to be the case
for SNR 0540. Shells of CSM have also been observed
in Type Ib/c SNe with lower-mass progenitors, such as
SN 2001em (Chugai & Chevalier 2006), SN 2014C (Mil-
isavljevic et al. 2015) and SN 2019oys (Sollerman et al.
2020). However, these kinds of shells are H-rich, whereas
the ring in SNR 0540 emits only in [O III]. Another pos-
sible complication with interpreting the [O III] ring as
CSM is that it would have had to survive the passage of
the main blast wave many years ago.

In our preferred interpretation that the [O III] emit-
ting material is SN ejecta, the observed velocities are ex-
pected to reﬂect the location of the O zone of the progen-
itor. In line with this, the simulations of neutrino-driven

The ejecta of SNR 0540 in 3D

15

SN explosions by Wongwathanarat et al. (2015) shows
a shell of O at comparable velocities for the 15 M(cid:12) red
supergiant model “W15” (their ﬁgure 14). The reason
we observe a ring-like structure rather than a shell of O
in SNR 0540 may be due to localized energy input from
the pulsar/PWN, a CSM geometry that constrains the
expanding ejecta into a plane, asymmetries in the explo-
sion and/or rotation of the progenitor. In the scenario
where the ring reﬂects the density distribution rather
than a localized source of ionization, we can obtain a
simple estimate of the density enhancement in the ring
plane from the ﬂux proﬁles in Figure 11. We assume
that the temperature does not vary with position and
consider the fact that the emissivity scales as density
squared. A comparison of the red- and blueshifted ﬂuxes
in the northern and southern hemispheres then shows
that the density enhancement along the ring is 1.4 and
2.6 in the north and south, respectively.

In terms of understanding the origin of the ring, it is
interesting to note that a torus of [O III] emission at a
velocity of ∼ 1700 km s−1 has been observed in the O-
rich remnant N132D (Law et al. 2020) and that ALMA
observations of SN 1987A have revealed a torus of CO,
also with a radius of ∼ 1700 km s−1 (Abell´an et al.
2017). These observations of rings/tori of O at simi-
lar velocities in diﬀerent remnants raises the possibility
that this structure is intrinsic to the ejecta distribution,
rather than reﬂecting the details of the energy input
(pulsar/PWN in SNR 0540, reverse shock in N132D and
radioactive decay of 44Ti in SN 1987A). An example of
such an explanation is that the rings are connected to
the rotation of progenitor stars with similar masses. At
the same time we note that rings are not ubiquitous. For
example, the O-rich SNR G292+1.8 also shows reverse-
shocked [O III] knots at ∼ 1700 km s−1, but the distri-
bution appears to be consistent with a shell in this case
(Ghavamian et al. 2005).

There are currently no clear predictions for how the
ejecta distribution will be aﬀected by rotation, as nu-
merical simulations of explosions evolved to late times
have not been performed for rotating progenitors. How-
ever, it is interesting to note that a ﬂattened distribution
of ejecta resembling Cas A has been obtained in 3D sim-
ulations of a neutrino-driven explosion of a non-rotating
star evolved to the remnant stage (Orlando et al. 2021).
In this case, a thick torus-like ejecta distribution reﬂects
a large-scale asymmetry of Fe at the time of shock break-
out.

5.3. The H-blob

The MUSE observation revealed a large blob of Hα
and Hβ emission located southeast of the pulsar, at ve-

locities in the range 1500 − 3500 km s−1. The velocities
are comparable to those observed for [O III], but the
emission regions of the two lines do not overlap, with
the H-blob being located on the near side of the [O III]
ring with respect to the observer.
In our calculations
of the full 3D velocities we have assumed that the blob
is freely expanding ejecta, which is supported by the
similar distance from the center and Doppler shifts as
observed for the extended [O III]. However, other expla-
nations cannot be ruled out, including that it is CSM or
a blown-oﬀ envelope of a binary companion.

There are no other broad lines detected from the blob
region that can provide additional information about its
properties. Unfortunately, any possible emission from
He I λ5876 cannot be analyzed due to the gap in the
wavelength coverage of MUSE. To estimate the H mass
in the blob, we use the observed luminosity of Hβ. While
the S/N of Hβ is low, we consider this luminosity more
reliable than that of Hα due to better removal of nar-
row lines (Figure 7) and the possibility of a low level of
contamination by [N II] in the Hα proﬁle.

Assuming fully ionized H, the recombination emission

from Hβ can be approximated as (Osterbrock 1989)

jHβ = 1.24 × 10−25

(cid:19)−0.91

(cid:18) T
104

nenp erg s−1 cm−3,

(2)
where T is the temperature and ne and np are the elec-
tron and proton number densities, respectively. For a
blob with volume V , where the electrons and protons
have the same ﬁlling factor, f , the luminosity can be
expressed as

Lblob,Hβ = jHβV f 2 =

jHβMblob,pf
mpnp

erg s−1,

(3)

where we have used the fact that the mass of H in the
blob is given by Mblob,p = V mpnpf , with mp being the
proton mass. Combining these expressions and using
the measured Hβ luminosity of Lblob,Hβ = 1.0 ± 0.1 ×
1033 erg s−1, the mass of the blob can be expressed as

Mblob,p = 6.8 (nef )−1

(cid:19)0.91

(cid:18) T
104

M(cid:12) .

(4)

The values of the variables on the right hand side are
unknown, but given that f < 1, a substantial mass of H
is implied.

In the scenario where the blob originates from the H-
envelope of a binary star, one would expect (cid:46) 10% of the
total mass of a close companion to have been blown oﬀ,
depending on the properties of the explosion and com-
panion star (Liu et al. 2015; Rimoldi et al. 2016; Hirai
et al. 2018). As an example, for a typical temperature

16

Larsson et al.

of T = 104 K, equation 4 gives Mblob,p > 0.6 M(cid:12) for an
eﬀective electron density of nef = 10 cm−3, implying a
massive companion. We stress that these numbers are
uncertain and that the eﬀective density is unknown, but
the example serves to illustrate that the binary interpre-
tation cannot be ruled out.

Advantages of this interpretation is that it provides
natural explanations for the high velocities (with the
spectra showing strong emission extending to blueshifts
of −1600 km s−1, Figure 7), as well as the lack of emis-
sion in any other direction around the pulsar. By con-
trast, the high velocities are challenging for any explana-
tion related to CSM (or ISM), as discussed in the context
In addition, even if there are exam-
of [O III] above.
ples of stars with highly asymmetric mass-loss, such as
VY CMa (Smith et al. 2001), the H-blob would consti-
tute an extreme example of asymmetric CSM. A sim-
ilar consideration also applies to the interpretation of
the blob as ejecta – a single large blob of high-velocity
H clearly stands out as exceptional when compared to
asymmetric ejecta observed in other SNRs.

A possible explanation for the highly localized emis-
sion within the ejecta and CSM interpretations is that
the blob is energized by a pulsar jet, implying that any
H located away from the jet axis would be invisible to
us. A jet-axis along the northwest-southeast direction
has been proposed based on the X-ray morphology (Got-
thelf & Wang 2000), which is also supported by changes
in the polarization angle along the perpendicular axis
(Lundqvist et al. 2011). The blob is indeed located at
the southeastern end of the proposed jet direction. How-
ever, the morphological X-ray features attributed to a
jet are strongest in the northwest, where no H emission is
seen. It thus seems unlikely that the observations can be
explained solely by localized energy input from a jet, at
least not without also invoking a highly asymmetric dis-
tribution of ejecta or CSM. Another diﬃculty for the jet
interpretation is the lack of any apparent X-ray or radio
emission from the region of the blob (see e.g., Brantseg
et al. 2014) as might be expected from shocks driven
by a jet, though we stress that a quantitative analysis
would need to be carried out to constrain models.

5.4. SNR 0540 in the population of SNRs

SNR 0540 belongs to the class of O-rich remnants,
which are generally thought to originate from stripped-
envelope SNe. Our detection of Hα and Hβ in the inner-
most region clearly demonstrates that SNR 0540 was a
Type II explosion. However, the innermost region only
contains a small fraction of all the ejecta, which makes it
diﬃcult to draw any ﬁrm conclusions regarding the to-
tal mass of H and hence whether the SN was a Type IIb

or a IIP. The high-velocity H-blob would support the
latter if associated with ejecta, but we cannot exclude
alternative explanations as discussed above.

Cas A, the most well-studied O-rich SNR, is known
to originate from a Type IIb explosion based on light-
echo observations (Krause et al. 2008), which also re-
veal evidence for asymmetries (Rest et al. 2011). Like
SNR 0540, it shows rings of ejecta, but on markedly
larger scales at higher velocities of ∼ 5000 km s−1 (Mil-
isavljevic & Fesen 2015). The lower ejecta velocities in
SNR 0540 may reﬂect diﬀerences in the progenitor, with
SNR 0540 having a more massive H envelope more in
line with expectations for a Type IIP SN. On the other
hand, most of the emission in Cas A is powered by the
reverse shock and there is no PWN that can energize its
lowest-velocity ejecta, which will naturally lead to some
diﬀerences in the range of observed velocities. Assuming
that the reverse shock in SNR 0540 is located just inside
the radio/X-ray shell, it would be at an ejecta velocity
of ∼ 6400 km s−1. To date there is no clear evidence
for optical emission associated with a reverse shock in
SNR 0540, but we will present a detailed search for this
using these MUSE observations in future work.

Compared to other O-rich remnants, SNR 0540 shows
some similarities with N132D and G292, as already men-
tioned above. The remnant E0102 in the Small Magel-
lanic Cloud is another interesting member of this class
(Dopita et al. 1981).
It has been reported to show
rings of ejecta that resemble the expectations for Ni
bubbles (Eriksen et al. 2001). Recent MUSE observa-
tions of this remnant also revealed fast-moving knots of
Hα and Hβ emission with Doppler shifts in the range
−1800 − +800 km s−1 (Seitenzahl et al. 2018). This
shows that E0102 was a Type II explosion (likely a
Type IIb), though we note that the H knots are smaller
and distributed over a wider range of directions than the
large blob of H that we identify in SNR 0540.

It is also illuminating to compare the ejecta distribu-
tion in SNR 0540 with the Crab. Despite the rather dif-
ferent progenitors, the two remnants are similar in terms
of the pulsar and PWN. The Crab was recently mapped
in 3D, revealing an overall heart-shaped morphology
with ﬁlamentary structures in a honeycomb distribution
(Martin et al. 2021). While the large-scale morphology
appears to be constrained by a pre-existing circumstellar
disc, it is also clearly elongated along the axis of the pul-
sar torus. This is diﬀerent from SNR 0540, where the di-
rection of the pulsar axis is uncertain and the overall 3D
morphology has a more irregular shape. However, there
are similarities in terms of the small-scale morphology,
which includes ring-like structures that are resolved in
much greater detail in the Crab than in SNR 0540. The

fact that similar structures are seen also in remnants
that lack PWNe, like Cas A, indicate that they likely
reﬂect intrinsic asymmetries in the explosions.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the 3D distribution of ejecta in
SNR 0540 using observations from the integral-ﬁeld
spectrograph MUSE. We focused on the strongest emis-
sion lines, which are Hβ,
[O III] λλ4959, 5007, Hα,
[S II] λλ6717, 6731, [Ar III] λ7136 and [S III] λ9069.
These observations were complemented by 2D spectra
from X-shooter, which provides high spectral resolution
and also covers the emission lines [O II] λλ3726, 3729
and [Fe II] λ12567. We constructed 3D velocity maps
assuming freely expanding ejecta, centered at the posi-
tion of the pulsar and the average redshift of the local
ISM. The clump-ﬁnding algorithm FellWalker was used
to analyze the 3D maps. From these observations we
identify three main emission components, summarized
below.

• Inner PWN. This region covers the innermost
ejecta with velocities (cid:46) 1000 km s−1, thought to
have been shocked by the pulsar wind. The ejecta
are distributed in clumpy rings that surround an
inner cavity. The cavity extends 150 − 550 km s−1
in diﬀerent directions, the rings have diameters
500 − 600 km s−1 and the clumps have typical
RMS sizes ∼ 100 km s−1, with the smallest clumps
reaching the resolution limit of (cid:46) 30 km s−1 in X-
shooter data. The clumps are thus smaller than
the voids. There is also a global asymmetry, with
higher ﬂuxes and velocities on the redshifted side.
All emission lines have broadly similar morpholo-
gies, including Hα and Hβ, providing clear evi-
dence that H was mixed down to low velocities
in the explosion. The mixing is also expected to
have been enhanced by the pulsar wind sweeping
up low-velocity ejecta. On a more detailed level,
there are small diﬀerences between diﬀerent lines.
The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence is that O extends
slightly further out (by up to ∼ 200 km s−1) than
the lines from S, Ar and Fe in some directions,
which may reﬂect the origin in diﬀerent layers of
the star.

• Extended [O III] emission. Faint [O III] emis-
sion surrounds the inner PWN in all directions.
The emission is dominated by an irregular ring-
like structure with a radius of ∼ 1600 km s−1 and
inclination ∼ 40◦, though faint emission can be
traced to ∼ 3000 km s−1. Using clumps identiﬁed
in the [O III] ring, we estimate a kinematic age of

1146±116 years for the remnant. We interpret the
ring as ejecta rather than pre-SN mass loss based
on the agreement between this kinematic age and
the pulsar spin-down age (∼ 1660 years), together
with the fact that the high velocities match the
expected location of the O zone of the progenitor.
The reason why the O forms a ring rather than
a shell may be due to localized energy input from
the pulsar/PWN, a CSM geometry that constrains
the expanding ejecta into a plane, asymmetries in
the explosion and/or rotation of the progenitor.

• High-velocity H-blob. A bright blob of Hα and
Hβ emission is located southeast of the pulsar, ex-
tending between radial distances 8 − 14(cid:48)(cid:48) and ex-
hibiting a broad spectral proﬁle with blueshifted
velocities reaching −1600 km s−1. If interpreted
as freely expanding ejecta, the full velocities span
the range 1500 − 3500 km s−1. The blob is posi-
tioned in front of the [O III] ring with respect to
the observer and there is no corresponding emis-
sion in any other direction around the pulsar. We
tentatively favor an interpretation as ejecta based
on the location and velocities, but note that alter-
native explanations cannot be ruled out, including
the possibility that it is part of a blown-oﬀ enve-
lope of a binary companion.

These results highlight the importance of asymmetries
and mixing in SN explosions. They also add to the
growing evidence that rings and clumps are ubiquitous
features of SN ejecta, likely reﬂecting hydrodynamical
instabilities in the explosions. Finally, the detection of
Hα and Hβ in the ejecta cements the identiﬁcation of
SNR 0540 as a Type II SN explosion. Further analysis of
the MUSE and X-shooter observations will provide new
insights into the progenitor, pulsar and environment sur-
rounding SNR 0540.
