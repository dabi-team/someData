We study the possibility of observing Schwinger pair production enhanced by a thermal bath of photons.
We consider the full range of temperatures and electric ﬁeld intensities from pure Schwinger production to
pure thermal production, and identify the most promising and interesting regimes. In particular we identify
temperatures of ∼ 20 keV/kB and ﬁeld intensities of ∼ 1023 Wcm−2 where pair production would be observable.
In this case the thermal enhancement over the Schwinger rate is exponentially large and due to eﬀects which
are not visible at any ﬁnite order in the loop expansion. Pair production in this regime can thus be described as
more nonperturbative than the usual Schwinger process, which appears at one loop. Unfortunately, such high
temperatures appear to be out of reach of foreseeable technologies, though nonthermal photon distributions with
comparable energy-densities are possible. We suggest the possibility that similar nonperturbative enhancements
may extend out of equilibrium and propose an experimental scheme to test this.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Schwinger long ago predicted that a strong, constant elec-
tric ﬁeld will create electron-positron pairs [1]. This has, how-
ever, never been experimentally observed as the electric ﬁeld
strengths required are several orders of magnitude larger than
has ever been achieved in the laboratory [2, 3]. The rate of
pair production becomes large as the electric ﬁeld strength
approaches an appreciable fraction of the Schwinger critical
ec3/e(cid:126), corresponding to an electric ﬁeld inten-
ﬁeld, Ec = m2
sity Ic = 1
c ≈ 2 × 1029 Wcm−2. It has also long ago been

predicted that one can create electron-positron pairs from a
thermal bath of photons [4], via the two photon Breit-Wheeler
process, γγ → e+e− [5]. This too has never been observed
due to the unattainably high temperatures required (although
an experiment has been proposed that uses a quasi-thermal ra-
diation ﬁeld for one of the two photons [6]). In this case, the
rate of pair production becomes large when kBT becomes an
appreciable fraction of the rest mass energy of an electron and
positron, 2mec2 ∼ 1 MeV.

One can, however, combine these two ingredients. Start-
ing from an initial state containing a thermal bath of pho-
tons at a high temperature and adding a strong, constant elec-
tric ﬁeld, one ﬁnds the rate of pair production is signiﬁcantly
faster than either the Schwinger process or the purely ther-
mal process alone. The nature of the process depends on the
relative magnitudes of the electric ﬁeld strength and the tem-
perature. At low temperatures, when E/Ec (cid:29) kBT/2mec2,
the process is essentially Schwinger pair production, in which
virtual electron-positron pairs tunnel quantum mechanically
through their energy barrier to existence. In the opposite limit,
E/Ec (cid:28) kBT/2mec2, at high temperatures, virtual electron-
positron pairs are given suﬃcient energy from the thermal

bath to transition over the barrier classically. At intermedi-
ate temperatures the process can be described as thermally
enhanced quantum tunnelling, whereby the virtual electron-
positron pairs tunnel from an excited state at nonzero separa-
tion.

Here we consider the viability of observing the thermal

ﬁrst observation of semiclassical pair production in quantum
electrodynamics (QED), a class of nonperturbative phenom-
ena with applications in many branches of physics, includ-
ing astrophysics, cosmology, heavy ion collisions, and plasma
physics (see for example [7]). It would also open up the con-
trolled study of semiclassical pair production in general, a
very basic process in quantum ﬁeld theory and one that has
proved elusive experimentally.

To put our work in context, we note that several other mech-
anisms have been proposed to lower the intensities required
for Schwinger pair production, by including high frequency
ﬁelds [8–17], or the Coulomb ﬁelds of highly charged nuclei
[18–21]. Further, it has been pointed out that once an initial
seed pair has been produced, a cascade of pair production will
follow for suﬃciently strong ﬁeld intensities [22–24]. This
may dramatically amplify any signal of Schwinger pair pro-
duction. On the experimental side of strong-ﬁeld QED, there
has been much progress on a variety of fronts [25–30], and the
next generation of high intensity lasers oﬀer exciting possibil-
ities to discover and investigate qualitatively new phenomena
in QED [3, 31].

In the regime we consider here, there is an additional sig-
niﬁcance, in that the formula for the rate of pair production
is a rare example of an all-orders and all-loop result in QED
[32, 33]. Perturbative estimates of the rate of pair production
are orders of magnitude slower, so could be distinguished ex-
perimentally. Hence, one can probe QED beyond the pertur-
bative loop expansion, and could decide experimentally on the
validity of conjectured all-order behaviours of QED [32–37].
Further, an experimental veriﬁcation of the formulae would
directly carry over to strongly-coupled physics, and hence
provide an important validation of principle in the search
for magnetic monopoles [38, 39]. As such, an experimental
search for the thermal Schwinger process is well motivated

II. THEORETICAL RESULTS

At zero temperature, and for electric ﬁeld strengths some-
what below Ec, the rate of electron-positron pair produc-
tion per unit volume in a constant electric ﬁeld is given by
Schwinger’s result [1],

eE(cid:126) .

(1)

Loop corrections to this formula have been computed at two
loops [36, 40–42], (see also [43]) and have been resummed to
all loops (within the quenched approximation) [35, 36]. How-
ever, the loop corrections are small, and only give an O(1%)
enhancement over Schwinger’s one-loop result. At leading
loop order, there are also corrections which are exponentially
subdominant for small E/Ec [1].

If one adds a thermal bath of photons, the rate is enhanced.
Note that in this analysis it is crucial that there are very few
charged particles in the initial thermal state as their presence
would Debye screen the electric ﬁeld. The Debye screen-
ing length should be longer than the scales relevant for pair
production (which we give in Section IV). Hence, we assume
kBT (cid:28) mec2.

Depending on the relative magnitudes of E and T one ﬁnds
three diﬀerent regimes.
In the lowest temperature regime,
the energy of the thermal bath is less than the energy that
an electron-positron pair would gain when accelerated by the
electric ﬁeld over their Compton wavelength. That is, for tem-
peratures lower than

TCW := eE(cid:126)/(2meckB).

(2)

In this regime, the thermal bath is negligible and electron-
positron pairs are produced by quantum tunnelling from vir-
tuality in vacuum, to reality. Above TCW the thermal bath ex-
cites virtual electron-positron pairs signiﬁcantly above their
ground state. Pair production then takes the form of quantum
tunnelling from an excited state. At higher temperatures still,
virtual electron-positron pairs acquire suﬃcient energy from
thermal ﬂuctuations to go over the energy barrier classically.
This process dominates over quantum tunnelling for tempera-
tures greater than

FIG. 1. Approximate rates of pair production for low, medium and
high temperatures. The coloured region is where the approximations
leading to Eqs. (1), (5) and (6) are well satisﬁed. All rates are nor-
malised by Γ
= 0.1 µm−3µs−1. For intermediate temperatures we
use only the leading two contributions in the ﬁne structure constant
whereas in the high temperature regime all orders are included. This
leads to the apparent discontinuity which will be smoothed out by
contributions at higher orders.

Ref

Low temperatures, T < TCW : For very low temperatures,
T (cid:28) TCW , corrections to the Schwinger rate can be considered
perturbatively. The dominant contribution to the rate in this
regime is thus given by Fig. 2 (a), just as at T = 0. The
leading thermal corrections arise at two loops and are [44]

As T increases towards TCW , higher order perturbative correc-
tions become important. The exponential enhancement due to
these corrections has been computed at leading [45] and next-
to-leading [32] order. The corrections to the exponent of the
rate are small if E (cid:46) Ec, except if one is very close to TCW
in which case even the exponent is unknown. Where one can
trust the calculations, the thermal enhancement at low temper-
atures is less that 1%.

Intermediate temperatures, TCW < T < TWS : At TCW , the
rate goes through a sharp transition. In this intermediate tem-
perature range, the rate of pair production is signiﬁcantly (ex-
ponentially) enhanced by the presence of the thermal bath. For
intermediate temperatures, the exponent of the rate is given by

though there has been some dispute on this [50, 51]. The pre-
cise formula, including the prefactor of the exponential has re-
cently been worked out in Ref. [52]. There it was also shown

given by Fig. 2 (b).

High temperatures, TWS < T : At TWS there is again a sharp
transition in the rate. In the high temperature regime, the pair
production process can be seen as a thermal process enhanced
by the presence of the electric ﬁeld. Unlike the lower tem-
perature regimes, the rate is not dominated by the diagrams in
Fig. 2; inﬁnitely more such diagrams contribute to the lead-
ing approximation to the rate, leading to a signiﬁcant non-
perturbative enhancement. Some of the present authors have
recently calculated the rate [32, 33]. It is given by

only valid when the rate of pair production is not too fast. For

As one can see from this expression, surprisingly the rate is
higher for weaker ﬁelds. This behaviour cannot be extrapo-
lated to arbitrarily weak ﬁelds as the validity of our approxi-
mations breaks down for E (cid:46) e(kBT )2/c2(cid:15)0(cid:126)2.

For a thermal bath of photons in zero electric ﬁeld, electron-
positron pairs can be produced by two photon fusion (the
Breit-Wheeler process). Integrating the cross section for this
process over the photon thermal distribution one ﬁnds [4]2

2 Note that there are several typos in Ref. [4]. We have repeated the calcula-
tion for low temperatures, both fully numerically and in the nonrelativistic
approximation, ﬁnding agreement with Eq. (8).

FIG. 2. Feynman diagrams which dominate the rate of thermal
Schwinger pair production in the (a) low and (b) intermediate tem-
perature regimes. Double lines denote the electron propagator in-
cluding the eﬀect of the external electric ﬁeld to all orders and the
wiggly lines denote photons from the thermal bath. In the high tem-
perature regime, the rate is not dominated by a single such Feynman
diagram but inﬁnitely many diagrams contribute to the leading ap-
proximation to the rate.

We note that the addition of a constant electric ﬁeld does not
enhance the perturbative Breit-Wheeler process as a constant
ﬁeld consists of zero energy photons. Beyond this idealised
limit, corrections to the Breit-Wheeler rate due to the pres-
ence of an additional source of photons with wavelength λ
are suppressed by exp(−λm2c3/(2π(cid:126)kBT )). For a typical laser
source with λ = 0.8 µm and a thermal bath of temperature
T = 20 keV/kB, say, this correction is completely negligible

.

The Breit-Wheeler process should not be thought of as
a competing process to thermal Schwinger pair production.
Fig. 2 (b) shows the dominant Feynman diagram for ther-
mal Schwinger pair production in the intermediate tempera-
ture regime. Applying the Optical Theorem, one can see that
a unitarity cut of diagram (b) gives the Breit-Wheeler pro-
cess [52], except that the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld has been
accounted for to all orders, giving a nonperturbative enhance-
ment over the pure Breit-Wheeler process.
In fact, Eq. (5)
reduces to Eq. (8) for temperatures T (cid:29) TCW .

However, in the high temperature regime, T > TWS , the
diagrams of Fig. 2 cease to dominate the rate of pair produc-
tion and there is a further nonperturbative enhancement that
cannot easily be understood diagramatically. As can be seen
from Eqs. (6) and (7), the dependence of the rate, ΓS , on the
ﬁne-structure constant is non-analytic even after one absorbs
one power of e into the electric ﬁeld.

For completeness, we note that the addition of a single elec-
tromagnetic plane wave to a thermal bath of photons also leads
to nonperturbatively enhanced electron-positron pair produc-
tion. This is true even in the long-wavelength limit, λmc/(cid:126) →
∞, showing the collective, nonperturbative nature of the phe-

we will note later, Eq. (9) is orders of magnitude smaller than
the thermal Schwinger rate, showing that the absence of the
magnetic ﬁeld is crucial for pair production.

III. OBSERVABILITY

FIG. 3. Schematic of the experimental set-up. Two counter propa-
gating high energy beams are focused into an X-ray radiation ﬁeld
produced by a burning fusion.

We would like to understand exactly how high the tempera-
tures and how strong the electric ﬁelds need to be to get a mea-
surable rate of pair production. To answer that, we will make
a simple comparison with the experiment of Ref. [25], which
was the ﬁrst experiment to observe the (multi-photon) Breit-
Wheeler process. They observed 106 ± 14 positrons produced
in this way, from a total spacetime interaction volume of order
10−21 m3s (when integrated over all laser shots). Hence we
take as our observable reference rate ΓRef = 1023 m−3s−1 =
0.1 µm−3µs−1, which is approximately Avogadro’s number
of positrons per metre cubed per second. One can therefore
reasonably expect that a normalised rate greater than 1 will
be required for the rate of pair production to be measurable.
In Fig. 1 we show the thermal Schwinger rate in all three
regimes, normalised by this reference rate.

The almost perfectly vertical lines of constant rate in the
low temperature regime reﬂect that, in this regime, the ther-
mal enhancements are small. As such, this regime oﬀers no
advantages over pure Schwinger pair production for experi-
mentally observing pair production. On the other hand, in
the intermediate and high temperature regimes, the thermal
enhancements are very signiﬁcant. Of these two regimes, ob-
serving pair production in the high temperature regime is eas-
ier, because the electric ﬁeld intensities required are orders of
magnitude smaller, while the temperatures required are very
similar.

From Figure 1 one can see that

temperatures around
O(20 keV/kB) or above are needed in order to produce an ob-
servable number of positrons. Perhaps the leading method of
producing high temperature thermal photons is with a laser
and cavity, or holhraum. The aim of achieving inertial con-
ﬁnement fusion (ICF) has been a powerful incentive in devel-
oping these technologies. Thermal distributions of 0.3 keV/kB
have been achieved since 1990, though about 0.4 keV/kB
is likely the upper limit of this approach [54]. Unfortu-
nately at these temperatures, the thermal enhancement of the
Schwinger rate is negligible.

When ICF is achieved, the burning thermonuclear plasma
leads to signiﬁcantly higher energy densities. Charged par-
ticles in the plasma are expected to reach temperatures from
O(20 keV/kB) to O(200 keV/kB), depending on the composi-
tion and size of the burning plasma [55, 56]. Burning deu-
terium (D) plasmas are expected to be hotter than burning

deuterium-tritium (DT) plasmas, as the peak nuclear reaction
rate is at higher energies for D-D nuclear reactions. For a ﬁxed
composition, larger plasmas reach higher temperatures.

As the plasma is not optically thick, the eﬀective tempera-
ture of the photons is lower than that of the charged particles.
For representative examples, of burning deuterium plasma
with radii r = 120 µm and r = 150 µm, one ﬁnds that the pho-
ton energy density is equal to that of a Planck distribution with
two degrees of freedom at T = 22 keV/kB and T = 26 keV/kB
respectively. The photon distribution can be calculated using
the approach of Ref. [56]. However, the result is further from
equilibrium than that of the charged particles. For now, we
will assume a thermal distribution of photons, though we will
return to this point in Section V.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL SCHEME

So, in order to observe the thermal Schwinger process, we
would propose combining two lasers with combined intensity
O(1023 Wcm−2) with a source of thermal photons with tem-
perature O(20 keV/kB). A possible schematic for such an
experiment is shown in Figure 3. The region of interest for
our purposes is on the left-hand side, outside the ignited ther-
monuclear plasma. A window is needed to hold up the mate-
rial expansion long enough to allow the high-intensity lasers
to interact with the radiation from the ICF capsule. The wall
of the hohlraum would in principle be able to act in this way
whilst transmitting the majority of the radiation, though this
would require speciﬁc design. As long as the distances from
the nuclear plasma are small compared with its radius, the ge-
ometric reduction of the intensity will not be signiﬁcant.

The electric ﬁeld is provided by a high intensity laser, split
into two counter-propagating beams. These are focused so
that the magnetic ﬁelds cancel in the vicinity of a given point,
whereas the electric ﬁelds reinforce. Assuming standard pa-
rameters for the laser, with wavelength λ ∼ 0.8 µm, the ﬁeld
maxima of the two beams are expected to be approximately
of size O(λ3) and of time extent O(λ/c), with approximately
10-20 ﬁeld maxima per shot, amounting to a possible pair pro-
duction region of size 5 × 10−32 m3s. The integrals of the rate
over the interaction region can be carried out in the locally

constant ﬁeld approximation (see for example Refs. [57, 58]),
within which the region around the ﬁeld maxima will domi-
nate the pair production. However, in what follows we simply
multiply the rates by the approximate spacetime volume of the
ﬁeld maxima, which is suﬃcient to get the order of magnitude
correct.

To achieve (cid:38) 1 electron-positron pair produced per shot, re-
quires a rate 5×106 times faster than ΓRef (see Fig. 4). Assum-
ing a thermal distribution of photons from the burning nuclear
plasma, this could be achieved at

T(cid:63) ≈ 20 keV/kB,
IE(cid:63) ≈ 1.3 × 1023 Wcm−2,

(10)

where IE refers to the combined intensity of the two beams.
This parameter point is shown as a star in Fig. 4. For com-
parison, we also consider a second point with a signiﬁcantly
higher production rate, at

T(cid:78) ≈ 26 keV/kB,
IE(cid:78) ≈ 3.7 × 1023 Wcm−2.

(11)

For these two sets of parameters, the numbers of positrons
produced per shot via the thermal Schwinger, Breit-Wheeler
and pure Schwinger (without thermal enhancement) processes
are given in Table I. We also include the nonperturbative en-
hancement to the number of positrons produced due to only
one of the two laser beams, given by Eq. (9).

Note that the pure Breit-Wheeler process can take place
in a larger region than that of the Schwinger pair produc-
tion, which is not accounted for in Table I. In order to en-
sure that the thermal Schwinger process dominates, and tak-
ing into account its O(106) times higher rate, the volume of
the interaction region should be signiﬁcantly less than about
107λ3 ≈ 5 × 10−3mm3. This can be achieved by modifying the
diameter of the hohlraum window and by focusing the laser
fairly close to the window. Further, the directionality of emit-
ted electrons and positrons can help distinguish between pro-
duction mechanisms, with the Breit-Wheeler process produc-
ing pairs more or less isotropically and the Schwinger process
producing pairs along the electric ﬁeld of the counterpropa-
gating lasers.

It is encouraging that a relatively small increase in both ra-
diation temperature and laser intensity produces such a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the production rate. One can also see that
the thermal Schwinger process has a huge nonperturbative en-
hancement. A simple perturbative estimate of the number of
positrons produced by the Breit-Wheeler process underesti-
mates the actual number by a factor of 106. Such large en-
hancements are a generic feature of the thermal Schwinger
process in the high temperature regime [33].

One can also compare the thermal Schwinger rate to that
obtained in a thermal bath plus only a single high intensity
laser beam (in which case the magnetic ﬁeld does not cancel).
In this case, the enhancement of the rate of pair production due
to the high intensity laser is given by Eq. (9). For the parame-
ters of either Eqs. (10) or (11), one ﬁnds that the enhancement
is negligible and the rate of this process is smaller than the

√

For the validity of the locally constant ﬁeld approximation,
it is important that the electric ﬁeld, as well as the photon
distribution from the plasma, are slowly varying on the time
and length scales of the pair creation process, described by
an instanton. The time scale of the instanton is tinst ∼ (cid:126)/kBT
e/(4π(cid:15)0E) [32, 33]. Using tempera-
and the length scale is
ture and electric ﬁeld strengths determined by Eq. (10), this
amounts to 3 × 10−20 s ≈ 10−11 m/c and 5 × 10−12 m respec-
tively. The smallest length scale on which the electric ﬁeld
varies is the wavelength of the laser. Assuming a laser with
wavelength of λ ∼ 0.8 µm, one can safely treat the electric
ﬁeld as constant. Further, one would expect the photon dis-
tribution from the plasma to vary on a length scale of order
the size of the hohlraum window. This will likewise be much
larger than the length scale of the instanton, ∼ 5×10−12 m, and
hence the locally constant ﬁeld approximation is applicable.

In the region where the electric ﬁeld and thermal pho-

an approximately thermal spectrum of velocities and then ac-
celerated in opposite directions antiparallel and parallel re-
spectively to the electric ﬁeld. Their thermal velocities are
isotropic in the lab frame and are expected to be rather large,
¯v2 ∼ kBT/me ∼ (0.2c)2. The ﬁeld then accelerates the par-
1
3
ticles over a distance (cid:46) λ, giving them a highly relativistic
velocity, v ≈ c, parallel to the electric ﬁeld and up to ener-
gies of order eEλ ∼ 1 GeV. Once produced, the electrons
and positrons may be deﬂected in opposite directions with
a magnet, after which their momenta can be measured by a
calorimeter, as in Ref. [25]. If the combined intensity of the
lasers is greater than around 1024 Wcm−1, a seed electron-
positron pair produced by the thermal Schwinger process will
induce a cascade of pair production, so amplifying any posi-
tive signal [22–24].

In the absence of charged particles, the thermal Schwinger
process is the dominant mechanism of electron-positron pair
production. However, if charged particles are not adequately
shielded, other pair production processes are possible, such
as the trident mechanism (e−Z → e−e+e−Z) and the Bethe-
Heitler process (γZ → e+e−Z). Another possibility is for
non-linear Compton scattering of charged particles in the laser
ﬁeld, producing high energy photons which then take part in
the Breit-Wheeler process. Debye screening by charged parti-
cles will also inhibit the thermal Schwinger process if the De-
bye length is not much longer than the length scale of the pair
e/(4π(cid:15)0E). For the parameters of Eq. (10),
creation process,
one requires the density of charged particles to be much less
than one per pm3. In the regime we have considered here, the
purely thermal and the purely Schwinger pair production rates
are orders of magnitude lower than the combination. Thus by
performing null shots, with either only the burning plasma or
only the high intensity laser, one can measure the presence of
any backgrounds.

√

V. PHOTON DISTRIBUTIONS

Let us return to consider the distribution of photons in the
burning plasma. This must be close to equilibrium for our
approach to be valid. To investigate this we have solved the
Boltzmann equation for the distribution of photons for a range
of diﬀerent plasma sizes and compositions. We have followed
the method of Ref. [56], including the eﬀect of Compton scat-
tering. For our representative example, of a burning deuterium
plasma of radius r = 150 µm, the photon intensity at the sur-
face of this plasma is shown as the full black line in Fig. 5.

Equating the photon energy density to that of a thermal
distribution, one ﬁnds that the eﬀective temperature of the
distribution is 26 keV/kB. Doing the same for the photon
number density, one instead ﬁnds a somewhat lower eﬀec-
tive temperature of 16 keV/kB, showing that the distribution
is shifted to higher energies with respect to a thermal distribu-
tion. Plotting the photon intensity of a Planck distribution at
T = 26 keV/kB, the blue dotted line in Fig. 5, one can see the
shift to higher energies.

The high energy tail of the distribution, above about

distribution at T = 148 keV/kB would lie at much higher intensities.

700 keV, is an exponential fall oﬀ and hence ﬁts well a Boltz-
mann tail with an eﬀective temperature of T = 148 keV/kB,
though scaled down by a normalisation, or equivalently a neg-
ative photon chemical potential3, µ = −1097 keV, plotted as
the dot-dashed green line in Fig. 5. At the lowest energies,
the distribution rises above this, and can be better described
by a purely thermal distribution at a much lower temperature,
T = 7.9 keV/kB, plotted as the dashed red line in Fig. 5. At
intermediate energies, the distribution is not well described by
a Bose-Einstein distribution. Nevertheless, the overall shape
of the distribution is qualitatively similar to a thermal distribu-
tion, being smooth and highly occupied with a power-like rise
at low energies and an exponential decrease at high energies,
though we have used four diﬀerent eﬀective temperatures to
describe diﬀerent aspects of it, ranging from 7.9 keV/kB to
148 keV/kB.

In two counterpropagating laser beams with intensity given
by Eq. (10) or (11), one ﬁnds that the intermediate tempera-
ture regime of thermal Schwinger pair production would be
reached at temperatures above

TCW,(cid:63) = 0.20 keV/kB,
TCW,(cid:78) = 0.32 keV/kB,

(12)

and the high temperature regime would be reached at temper-
atures above

TWS ,(cid:63) = 2.5 keV/kB,
TWS ,(cid:78) = 3.7 keV/kB.

(13)

All four eﬀective temperatures we have used to describe the
distribution of photons in the burning plasma are well above
these temperatures. We thus expect the high temperature
regime to provide a better description of pair production in this

sarily out of equilibrium. In this context its presence is natural as photon
number conserving processes dominate.

which would imply that the diagrams of Fig. 2 do not domi-
nate pair production and there is a nonperturbative enhance-
ment over both pure Schwinger and pure thermal pair produc-
tion.

Physically, it is clear that the process of pair production
should not depend on the photon gas being precisely in equi-
librium: if we use the picture of tunnelling from an excited
state, one would expect that it is the energy and density of the
photon distribution, rather than the nearness to equilibrium,
that matters.

On the other hand, the condition of equilibrium is necessary
for the calculation because it leads to important simpliﬁca-
tions in the calculation of the production rate. The nonpertur-
bative calculation of Eq. (6) [32, 33] relied heavily on the Mat-
subara formalism [59, 60], which is only valid in equilibrium.
In the high temperature regime a resummation of all-orders
of the perturbative loop expansion was required. Generalising
the result to any out-of-equilibrium distribution is beyond the
scope of this paper.

We note however that the diagrams of Fig. 2 can be cal-
culated in an arbitrary photon distribution, following the ap-
proach of Ref. [52], though in the high temperature regime
these diagrams are not dominant. Considering the calcula-
tion in this distribution, it can be seen that these diagrams re-
produce the perturbative Breit-Wheeler rate up to very small
corrections, essentially because the photon gas is highly oc-
cupied at energies much greater than kBTCW (see Eqs. (2) and
(12)). Further, perturbative corrections in this distribution due
to the high intensity laser require one photon from the high
energy tail of the distribution and hence are suppressed by
exp(−λm2c3/(2π(cid:126)kBT )+µ/kBT ) ∼ 10−105

refer to the green dot-dashed line in Fig. 5. Thus any enhance-
ment due to the high intensity laser must be a nonperturbative
phenomenon which goes beyond the diagrams of Fig. 2.

Because the full nonperturbative calculation of the rate of
pair production is beyond the scope of this paper, the possi-
bility of nonperturbative enhancements in our proposed setup
is conjectural. However, as all the eﬀective temperatures we
have used to describe the photon distribution are larger than
TWS , Eq. (13), we expect the high temperature regime to best
describe the photon distribution in question. We thus expect
a nonperturbative enhancement over the perturbative predic-
tion, as is the case in equilibrium where the enhancement
to the positron yield was O(106). The experiment we have
proposed here would be able to test this plausible conjec-
ture, by performing null shots without the counterpropagating
laser beams, for which only the perturbative process is pos-
sible. This would be able to determine which features of a
photon distribution are important for the nonperturbative en-
hancements to pair production which feature in the thermal
Schwinger eﬀect, and how generic such enhancements are.
