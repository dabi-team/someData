Abstract We investigated a peculiar metric type II solar radio burst with a

broken lane structure, which was observed on November 13, 2012. In addition

to the radio data, we also studied the data in the other wavelengths. The bursts

were associated with two CMEs and two ﬂares that originated from active region

AR 11613. A long current sheet was developed in the ﬁrst CME, and the second

CME collided with the current sheet ﬁrst and then merged with the ﬁrst one.

Combing information revealed by the multi-wavelength data indicated that a

coronal shock accounting for the type II radio burst, and that the collision of

this shock with the current sheet resulted in the broken lane of the type II radio

burst. The type II burst lane resumed after the shock passed through the current

sheet. We further estimated the thickness of the current sheet according to the

gap on the lane of the type II burst, and found that the result is consistent with

previous ones obtained for various events observed in diﬀerent wavelengths by

diﬀerent instruments. In addition, the regular type II burst associated with the

ﬁrst CME/ﬂare was also studied, and the magnetic ﬁeld in each source region

of the two type II bursts was further deduced in diﬀerent way.

1. Introduction

A solar eruption is associated with a disruption of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, in

which the closed magnetic ﬁeld in the low corona is severely stretched, and

a magnetically neutral region, also known as the current sheet (CS), forms

separating regions of oppositely directed magnetic ﬁelds. Magnetic reconnection

takes place inside the CS at a reasonably fast rate, produces the solar ﬂare in

the low solar atmosphere, and helps the upper part of the erupting magnetic

structure to escape to the outer corona and interplanetary space, giving rise

to a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CS is separating regions of oppositely

directed magnetic ﬁelds (e.g., see also Forbes and Lin, 2000; Lin and Forbes,

2000; Lin, 2002; Lin, Soon, and Baliunas, 2003; Forbes et al., 2006).

In the case when the eruption is energetic enough, it produces a fast expanding

CME that may further generate a coronal wave in front by the CME. Coronal

waves are considered to be signatures of large-amplitude fast-mode waves or

shocks. These signatures are easily seen in EUV and SXR, and even in white

light. (e.g., see Vourlidas et al., 2003; Ma et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2013). Fur-

thermore, type II bursts are the signatures of shocks traveling through the solar

corona, so they give unambiguous evidence for fast mode shocks driven by the

CME as opposed to other large-amplitude disturbances. In dynamic spectra, a

type II burst is often identiﬁed with two narrow parallel lanes in the metric to

kilometric wavelength ranges. The lane of the lower frequency results from the

fundamental band, and that of the higher energy from the harmonic band. They

are produced by Langmuir turbulence in the plasma that is excited by the fast

mode shock at the local electron plasma frequency, fp. So the observed emission

frequency fobs is related to fp and the electron density ne in the burst source
region by fobs = sfp, fp [kHz] = 8.98(cid:112)ne [cm−3], and thus to the height of
the source region if a coronal density model, ne=ne(h), is given. Here s is for the

fundamental (s = 1) and for the harmonic (s = 2) band, respectively (McLean

and Labrum, 1985).

There are two main classes of mechanisms for invoking type II radio bursts

including the CME-driven fast mode shock and the blast wave (e.g., Lin, Man-

cuso, and Vourlidas, 2006; Vrˇsnak and Cliver, 2008; Shanmugaraju, Moon, and

Vrˇsnak, 2009, and references therein). The ﬂare blast wave is believed to originate

in proximity to a solar ﬂare. This scenario is obviously based on the idea that

the ﬂare takes place explosively, like a bomb blowing out the nearby material in

every direction. The earliest records of the blast wave can be found in the works

of Wagner and MacQueen (1983) and Gary et al. (1984). Recently, high-cadence

EUV imaging of STEREO-EUVI and SDO-AIA has revealed in many events

that the early impulsive expansion of the CME-associated magnetic structure

could act as a temporary 3D piston, which generates a piston-driven shock that

propagates faster than the piston itself. The shock may also decouple from the

piston and continue as a freely propagating shock, such a freely propagating

shock is referred to as blast wave as well (e.g., see also Patsourakos et al.,

2009; Patsourakos and Vourlidas, 2009; Patsourakos, Vourlidas, and Kliem, 2010;

Patsourakos, Vourlidas, and Stenborg, 2010; Warmuth, 2015, and references

therein). On the other hand, the CME-driven shocks are also favored by the

recent studies of coronal type II bursts (e.g., Mancuso and Raymond, 2004; Man-

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 3

Gao et al.

cuso, 2007; Lin, Mancuso, and Vourlidas, 2006; Ramesh et al., 2012). Ramesh et

al. (2012) studied forty-one metric type II radio bursts located close to the solar

limb, and compared the positions of the bursts with the estimated location of

the leading edge of the associated CMEs close to the Sun, their results suggest

that nearly all the metric type II bursts are driven by the CME. So the origin

of the metric type II burst in the solar corona is still an open question.

In addition to those produced by a single coronal shock, the events similar

to the regular type II radio burst have also observed occasionally. These events

included the stationary type II burst due to the interaction between the recon-

nection outﬂow from the CME/ﬂare current sheet with the top of ﬂare loops or

the bottom of the CME bubble (e.g., Aurass, Vrˇsnak, and Mann, 2002; Aurass

and Mann, 2004; Aurass et al., 2011; Mann, Aurass, and Warmuth, 2006; Mann,

Warmuth, and Aurass, 2009; Warmuth, Mann, and Aurass, 2009; Gao et al.,

2014a; Chen et al., 2015), the type-II-like continuum burst following regular

type II burst as a result of the collision of two CMEs (Gopalswamy et al., 2002;

Gopalswamy, 2004), and regular type II bursts enhanced by the CME collision

(Gopalswamy et al., 2001; Gopalswamy, 2004; Mart´ınez Oliveros et al., 2012).

Furthermore, the bifurcation of the type II bursts were observed and believed to

excite in the downstream region of the shock (Vrˇsnak et al., 2001; Mancuso and

Abbo, 2004). Mancuso and Abbo (2004) also reported a bifurcation of the metric

type II emission as a result of the interaction of a piston-driven shock with a

vertical current sheet in the nearby helmet streamer. Recent studies reported

that the broken lane of the type II bursts were caused by the shock entering

the dense streamer structure from a tenuous coronal environment outside of the

streamer (Kong et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2012, 2013).

In this work, we are to study a metric type II burst observed by two diﬀerent

spectrometers. Both data sets display an obvious broken lane on the harmonic

band of the type II burst. Associated with the radio bursts were two CMEs and

ﬂares occurring successively from the same active region, which were observed by

several instruments in orbit. The multi-band observations of the CMEs and ﬂares

shown and discussed in next section. In Section 3, the reasonable explanation

The broken lane of a type II burst

for the formation of the broken lane structure on the type II burst will be given;

and we are discussing all results and develop conclusions in Section 4.

2. Observations

Between 23:00 UT on November 12, 2012 and 03:00 UT on November 13, 2012,

two eruptive events took place successively from the active region AR 11613.

Each event produced a CME and an M-class ﬂare. Both CMEs (or ﬂares)

generated the type II radio burst in the metric band. The diﬀerence between

these two type II radio bursts lies in that the ﬁrst one displayed a pair of regular

emission bands in dynamic spectrum with the harmonic band being much more

signiﬁcant than the fundamental one (see Figure 1), while the second burst

displayed a broken lane as shown in Figure 2, which is more interesting to us

and will be studied in detail.

The second type II burst occurred between 02:04 and 02:09 UT on November

13, 2012, and was detected by the Hiraiso Radio Spectrograph (HiRAS, Kondo

et al., 1995) that works over the frequency range from 20 to 2500 MHz. The

upper panel in Figure 2 displays the dynamic spectrum of this event obtained

by HiRAS with time cadence of 3∼4 s. It shows both fundamental and harmonic

band of the type II bursts. At the same time, the same event was also observed

by the metric spectrometer of the Yunnan Astronomical Observatories (YNAO,

see Gao et al., 2014b) working over the frequency range from 70 to 700 MHz with

the spectral resolution of 200 kHz, the time cadence of 80 ms, as well as the high

sensitivity (< 1 sfu). The dynamic spectrum of the event obtained by YNAO is

given in the lower panel of Figure 2, which shows ﬁne structures in the harmonic

band. Two continuous curves in this panel are the Nobeyama Radioheliograph

(NoRH, Nakajima et al., 1994) correlation plots at 17 and 34 GHz, respectively,

used as a proxy for the missing HXR data because no RHESSI data at that time

interval were available. We see from the lower panel in Figure 2 that the three

groups of type III radio bursts showing on the dynamic spectra correlated fairly

well with the three peaks of the emission at both 17 and 34 GHz.

upper and lower frequency branches (UFB and LFB, respectively) of the band-splitting on the

harmonic band indicated by the lines following the emission lanes.

Both panels in Figure 2 display a clear break or gap in the harmonic band

in the time interval between 02:04:25 and 02:05:15 UT, and the lower panel

shows more details of ﬁne structures because of the high frequency resolution

and sensitivity of the instrument. Here we note that, it is diﬃcult to recognize

the break or the gap in the fundamental band of the type II radio burst from the

HiRAS data (see the upper panel of Figure 2), and that the YNAO spectrometer

did not observe the fundamental band (see the lower panel of Figure 2) because

of the notch ﬁlters to suppress serious interferences in these bands (see Gao et

al., 2014b for details). So we use the harmonic band data to perform our studies

in this article.

At the same time when the above radio bursts were detected, two CMEs and

the associated solar ﬂares were observed by several instruments as well. We have

double checked the CME data in order to make sure that the CMEs and the

paper.

Dynamics Observatory (SDO), two CMEs and the associated ﬂares occurred

one after another, a current sheet (CS) was developed behind the ﬁrst CME

(see Figures 3 and 4), the second CME collided with the CS and the ﬁrst CME

successively, and the two CMEs merged eventually. The CS could be seen in the

images of STEREO-B/COR1-COR2 from 00:05:59 to 02:54:59 UT on November

13, 2012.

Figure 3 covers the time interval between 02:24:59 and 02:54:59 UT on Novem-

ber 13, 2012, and displays a set of composites of EUVI-B (195 ˚A)/COR1-

B/COR2-B images of the two CMEs and the CS that are marked in each panel.

Figures 3a–3b display the evolutionary features of the two CMEs occurred one

after another, and the second CME collided with the CS, and then the second

CME caught up with the ﬁrst CME. During the event, the STEREO A was

located at the opposite side of the Sun, so it could not observe the event.

the ﬁrst CME could be vaguely seen in Figures 4a–4c. According to the sequence

of various objects shown in Figures 3 and 4 together with the broken lane of

type II burst shown in Figures 2, we acquire a scenario such that the two CMEs

propagated roughly in the same direction, the second one moved faster than

the ﬁrst one, and we can infer the shock caused by the second CME (or by the

second blast wave) collided with the CS at about 02:04:25 UT before the second

CME caught up with the ﬁrst one (at about 04:24:59 UT). Here we note that

limited by the observational data we are able to collect, we cannot determine

the driver of the shock. However, the shock driver is not the main topic of this

work. We will focus on the broken lane structure of the type II burst itself.

Regarding the scenario of the shock impacting on the CS described above,

we need to point out that this scenario was constructed on the basis of indirect

evidence since no direct evidence is available for this event. The other possible

scenarios could not be ruled out. But we use the above scenario to help analyzing

the event and understanding the physics behind the observation presented in this

work.

The ﬁrst CME appeared in the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of STEREO–B/COR1

at 23:45:59 UT for the ﬁrst time on November 12, 2012 at the velocity of ∼

700 km s−1, and it was also seen at around 00:54:49 UT on November 13, 2012

by LASCO/C2–C3 at the speed of ∼ 611 km s−1 according to the LASCO CME

Catalog (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list). The diﬀerence in its speed could

be inﬂuenced by projection eﬀects because they are always only plane-of-sky

speeds. The second CME was ﬁrst seen by STEREO–B/COR1 at 02:25:59 UT

on November 13, 2012 (Figure 3a) at the velocity of ∼ 880 km s−1, and it also

appeared in the FOV of LASCO/C2 after 02:24:07 UT (Figure 4c) at the speed

of ∼ 851 km s−1 according to the LASCO CME Catalog (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.

gov/CME list).

In addition to CME propagations, the CS could also be recognized in the

STEREO B/COR1–COR2 and LASCO/C2–C3 images (see Figures 3 and 4).

Images of the CS shown in these panels indicate that the CS was observed

roughly edge-on by both satellites. This allows us to measure the apparent

thickness of the CS directly. From images of the STEREO B, we ﬁnd that the

value of this thickness is about 7 × 104 km, as indicated by the arrow of ‘CS’

in Figure 3a, and the LASCO data bring this value to around 4 × 104 km as

indicated by the arrow of ‘CS’ in Figure 4a, which is consistent with the results

obtained for the CS apparent thickness previously in diﬀerent events by various

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 10

The broken lane of a type II burst

instruments in diﬀerent wavelengths (e.g., see also Ciaravella et al., 2013; Ling

et al., 2014).

Associated with the two CMEs were two ﬂares which occurred in the active

region AR 11613 in succession, the ﬁrst one was a GOES M2.0-class ﬂare in

soft X-rays, the onset and peak time were 23:13 UT and 23:28 UT, respectively.

The second one was a GOES M6.0-class ﬂare, the onset and peak time were

01:58 UT and 02:04 UT, respectively. Figure 5 shows the time series of two

ﬂares observed by SDO/AIA in 304 in active region AR 11613, respectively. The

active region AR 11613 was a βγ/αγ active region, from which a total of 15

eruptions originated on November 13, 2012.

3. Data Analysis and Results

According to the standard theory of the solar eruption (Forbes and Acton, 1996;

Lin and Forbes, 2000), and the observations of white light images from STEREO-

B COR1/COR2, LASCO C2/C3 as shown in Figures 3 and 4, we draw a cartoon

(Figure 6) to schematically describe the process of the shock propagating through

the CS. As shown in the cartoon, we see how the fast-mode shock produced by

the second CME propagated, entered and left the CS behind the ﬁrst CME,

as well as the expected observational consequences. The crosses indicate the

center of the two CMEs, the light grey curves represent magnetic ﬁeld lines, the

light blue lines show the edges of the CS developed by the ﬁrst CME, the red

regions specify the CME bubble, ﬂare region, and the CS of the ﬁrst eruption,

respectively, and the bright blue region is for the second eruption. The thick black

curved lines specify the shock front, the red dot on the shock fronts indicates

the source of the type II radio burst, the solid arrow indicates the direction

of the shock propagation, the dotted curve speciﬁes the destructed part of the

shock accounting for the gap on the lane of the type II radio burst (see also the

bottom panel in Figure 2), and the dashed arrow shows the direction in which

the energetic electrons around the shock escape, generating the type III radio

burst that appears at the two edges of the gap.

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 11

Gao et al.

According to the scenario, a fast mode quasi-perpendicular (QPE) shock prop-

agated through the corona below the lower tip of the CS left by the ﬁrst CME

from 02:04:00 to 02:04:25 UT. Shock accelerated electrons produce the type II

burst accounting for the regular ‘backbone’ structure in the dynamic spectrum.

When the shock moved close to the CS, on the other hand, it reached (at least)

locally open magnetic ﬁeld lines around the CS and turned to quasi-parallel

(QPA), through which those fenced electrons escape from the shock producing

the type III radio burst (drifting to lower frequency) around one edge of the CS

(see Figure 2). As the shock left the CS, part of the shock and the associated

turbulent structures resumed, the accelerated electrons were bound around the

shock again, and the type III radio burst recovered near the another edge of the

CS. Eventually, after 02:05:15 UT, the shock left the CS completely and turned

back to a QPE one, and the type II radio burst totally recovered (see the right

segment of the regular lane in the bottom panel of Figure 2). Details and the

observational consequences of this process can be seen in Figure 6 clearly.

Mancuso and Raymond (2004) proposed a similar scenario in their model: The

strength of a MHD fast-mode shock in the corona could be very much enhanced

when a shock propagates along the axes of streamers that were identiﬁed as a

typically low Alfv´en speed structure with high density and weak magnetic ﬁeld.

However, for the CME–ﬂare CS, the situation could be diﬀerent. A CME–ﬂare

CS is usually a high temperature region in the corona (Ciaravella et al., 2002; Ko

et al., 2003; Ciaravella and Raymond, 2008; Lin et al., 2015), but the electron

density inside may not be very high. Theoretical calculations showed that the dif-

ference between the plasma density in the CS and that in the surrounding corona

does not exceed a factor of 4 (usually 2-3) because of the basic properties of the

plasma continuity (Priest and Forbes, 2000, p.31). The numerical experiments

suggested that the density inside the sheet can be comparable to that of the

surroundings (Shen, Lin, and Murphy, 2011), and the highest electron density

inside the CS is about 2.2 times that of the surroundings (see Figure 11 of Mei

et al., 2012). On the other hand, the electron acceleration eﬃciency strongly

depends on the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 12

The broken lane of a type II burst

ﬁeld. Generally a QPE shock favors the acceleration of electrons (e.g., Holman

and Pesses, 1983; Wu, 1984). Recently, a test-particle simulation by Kong et al.

(2016) found that the large-scale shock and the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration play

an important role in the eﬃciency and the location of electron accelerations.

Combining these pieces of knowledge with the information revealed by Figure

6, we realize that, in the event studied here, during 02:04:25 to 02:05:15 UT,

inside the CS, the shock was QPA, and less electrons could be eﬃciently accel-

erated by the shock, so the radio signal did not appear to be generated (see the

gap on the broken lane of the type II radio burst in the bottom panel of Figure

2).

The similar phenomenon of the disappearance of the radio signal was also

reported by Chen et al. (2015) recently. They noticed that a localized radio

source, as a tracer of the termination shock (TS), appeared and disappeared

successively. Combining all the results they could collect for the radio burst and

TS deduced from observations and numerical experiments, they concluded that

the radio signal disappeared as the TS was destroyed and, as a result, number

of the energetic electrons around the TS decreased dramatically (see also the

Figure 2d in Chen et al., 2015). Another broken lane events have been reported

by Feng et al. (2012), Kong et al. (2012), and Chen et al. (2014) for the case that

the coronal shock interacted with the CS inside a nearby helmet streamer. In the

present case, on the other hand, the coronal shock collided with the post-CME

CS.

Here we note that the crossing of other coronal structures by shocks might

also result in breaks or gaps in the type II bursts. In this event, on the other

hand, two events occurred from the same active region successively (see Figures

3–5), and two resultant CMEs propagated almost in the same direction. Both

CMEs (or ﬂares) produced type II bursts, but that produced by the ﬁrst CME

(or ﬂare) did not have broken lane in the dynamic spectrum (see Figure 1), which

indicates no plasma irregularities along the way the ﬁrst CME propagated. This

indirectly suggests that the broken lane of the second type II radio burst resulted

The broken lane of a type II burst

from the collision of the second shock with the CS formed in the wake of the

ﬁrst CME.

Since plasma emission is generally considered to produce the type II emission,

the lane of the type II radio burst in the dynamic spectrum gives the rate of the

frequency drift, df /dt, of the radio emission that results from the propagation

of the shock in the corona. Relating the observed radio emission frequency fobs

to the plasma electron frequency fp, and then to the local electron density ne

leads to the speed of the shock in the corona provided the dependence of ne on

the altitude h is given. Direct measurement of the slope of the type II burst lane

yields the rate of the frequency drift, df /dt, which is about −0.16 MHz s−1 for

the ﬁrst shock according to Figure 1, and about −0.46 MHz s−1 for the second

shock according to Figure 2, respectively. This may help us further deduce the

altitude and the corresponding speed of the shock provided the distribution of

the electron density in the corona is given.

In our calculations, the coronal electron density ne(h) = n0g(h) is described

by the empirical model of Sittler and Guhathakurta (1999), such that

g(h) = a1z2(h)ea2z(h)[1 + a3z(h) + a4z2(h) + a5z3(h)],

(1)

where z(h) = 1/(1 + h), a1 = 0.001292 a2 = 4.8039, a3 = 0.29696, a4 = −7.1743,
a5 = 12.321, with g(0) = 1, and n0 = 1010 cm−3 being the electron density at

the base of the corona.

Combining the relationship among fobs, fp, and ne with Equation (1), we

obtain a speed of about 851 km s−1 for the ﬁrst shock, according to Figure

1. The changes in altitude of the second shock against time, together with the

corresponding speeds, can be obtained as well according to Figure 2. The left

panel of Figure 7 displays the altitude changes of the second shock, and a linear

ﬁt to these data brings the speed of the second shock to 1100 km s−1. We note

here that the two outliers located on the spiky emission features above the type II

burst in the bottom panel of Figure 2 at 02:04:25 and 02:05:15 UT, respectively,

are used to indicate the energetic particles escaping from the shock, so unlike

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 15

Gao et al.

the other marks, the information revealed by them does not belong to the shock,

but to the escaping particles, therefore, we do not plot them in Figure 7.

The plots in the left panel of Figure 2 also indicate that the downstream of

the shock is perturbed more apparently than the upstream as the shock passed

through the CS region. This is probably because the magnetized plasma in the

downstream region is more turbulent than that near the upstream, which causes

more diﬀusion and thermalization of energetic particles, leading to weakening of

radio emission in the downstream region. Looking into the gap on the type II

burst lane displayed in Figure 2, we realize that the time interval covered by the

gap is about 50 s (from about 02:04:25 to 02:05:15 UT). Multiplying the time

interval of 50 s and the speed of the shock upstream gives a scale of the gap in

space, which is 5.5 × 104 km. This value represents a kind of extension of the CS

region in space, but may not be the thickness of the CS. Several uncertainties,

including those in electron density and inclination of the shock front to the CS,

make it diﬃcult to relate this value to the thickness of the CS although it is

close to the apparent value of the the CS thickness obtained earlier (e.g., Lin et

al., 2005, 2009; Ciaravella and Raymond, 2008; Vrˇsnak et al., 2009; Savage et

al., 2010).

In addition, if the shock was driven by the second CME as a bow shock, we

can also estimate the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld at the location, where the

type II radio burst was just initiated as the CME speed started to exceed the

local speed of the fast magneto-acoustic wave, which is approximately the local

Alfv´en speed in the low corona, and a shock commenced to form in front of the

CME. The dynamic spectra shown in Figure 2 give the start frequency of the

type II radio burst, and then the corresponding electron density, ne according

to relations of ne to fobs and fp. Equating either the CME speed or the shock

speed deduced from the dynamic spectrum for a given model of ne to the Alfv´en
speed, vA = B/(cid:112)4πmpne, where mp is the mass of the proton, we are able to
estimate the magnetic ﬁeld, B. In the present case, the speed of the second CME

was 851 km s−1, and the shock speed was about 1100 km s−1. Eventually, we

obtained that the magnetic ﬁeld strength was 7.5 G at the altitude of about

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 16

The broken lane of a type II burst

1.46 R(cid:12). Similarly, the information we just deduced for the ﬁrst shock helps us

deduce the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld was 2.6 G at the altitude of about

1.76 R(cid:12). However, a CME may also generate a piston-driven shock, for which

it is not necessary that the driver exceeds the local fast-mode speed (see the

discussions of Vrˇsnak and Cliver, 2008, and Warmuth, 2015). So the fact that

CME is some 25% slower than local fast-mode speed may not be due to the

density model or uncertainties in the starting location of the type II burst, but

due to the decoupling of the shock from the driver. Therefore taking into account

this extra 25% increment to the shock speed we obtained that the magnetic ﬁeld

was 9.4 G at the altitude of about 1.46 R(cid:12) for the second shock. For the ﬁrst

shock, the magnetic ﬁeld was 3.3 G at the altitude of about 1.76 R(cid:12).

On the other hand, we are able to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld of the source

region of the type II radio burst based on the band-splitting of the ﬁrst and

second type II burst (Figures 1 and 2). As a result of the plasma emission from

the upstream and downstream shock regions, the band-splitting frequencies indi-

cate the electron densities behind and ahead of the shock front (see the detailed

discussions of Vrˇsnak et al., 2001, 2002; Vrˇsnak, Magdaleni´c, and Zlobec, 2004).

So the band-splitting width of the ﬁrst type II burst revealed the density jump

across the shock wave, and the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) relation for the shock

wave can be used to deduce the related parameters (see also Smerd, Sheridan,

and Stewart, 1975; Mann, Classen, and Aurass, 1995; Priest and Forbes, 2000;

Vrˇsnak et al., 2002; Cho et al., 2007). The relationship between the downstream

and upstream density jump X (compression) and the Alfv´en Mach number MA

depends on the plasma β (the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic compres-

sion) and the angle θ between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic ﬁeld

(see also Priest and Forbes, 2000; Vrˇsnak et al., 2002). Here, MA is the speed

vsh of the shock front compared to the local Alfv´en speed vA, MA = vsh/vA.

The relative band-split (band distance width, BDW) is deﬁned as:

BDW = ∆f /fl = (fu − fl)/fl,

(2)

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 17

Gao et al.

where fu and fl are the frequencies measured at the upper and the lower fre-

quency branches as UFB and LFB (see Figure 1) respectively. The density jump,

X, across the shock is deﬁned as:

X = N2/N1 = (

fu
fl

)2 = (BDW + 1)2,

(3)

where N1 and N2 are the electron densities upstream and downstream of the

shock, respectively. fu and fl could be measured directly from UFB and LFB,

and deduce X from Equation (3). Furthermore, X is related to MA on the basis

of the standard theory of the the fast-mode shock (e.g., see Priest and Forbes,

2000, p. 31). In the case of the perpendicular shock (θ = 90◦), with β → 0 and

γ = 5/3 in the corona (Vrˇsnak et al., 2002) , MA is related to X in the way of

MA =

(cid:115)

X(X + 5)
2(4 − X)

.

(4)

To this point, we are able to deduce several important parameters mentioned

above for the ﬁrst type II radio burst. Table 1 lists X and MA, together with

the other parameters at diﬀerent times. We see that in the time interval of the

ﬁrst type II burst from 23:28 to 23:33 UT, values of BDW varied from 0.29 to

0.33, which corresponded to the density jump (X) between 1.67 and 1.77, and

the Alfv´en Mach number (MA) ranging from 1.54 to 1.64. The mean values of

these three parameters are 0.31, 1.73, and 1.60, respectively.

With the speed of the ﬁrst shock being known, vsh = 851 km s−1, and

the Alfv´en Mach number calculated above, we can obtain vA is between 520
and 560 km s−1 within the height range from 1.7 to 2 R(cid:12). Then, the ambi-

ent magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the way the shock propagated is deduced from
(cid:112)4πmpne, ne[cm−3] = (fl[kHz]/8.98)2, according to the information
revealed by the LFB. This eventually brings the electron number density to the

BG = vA

range from 6 to 1×107 cm−3, and the magnetic ﬁeld to the range from 2 G at

1.7 R(cid:12) to 1 G at 2 R(cid:12), respectively.

Similarly, for the second type II burst with the broken lane, we could also

estimate the magnetic ﬁeld of the source region of the type II radio burst ac-

cording to the feature and ﬁne structures of the signal lane as shown in Figure 2.

The data of the YNAO spectrometer with very high frequency resolution (∼ 200

kHz) and sensitivity (see Gao et al., 2014b for more details) allow us to perform

this investigation. Table 2 lists X and MA at diﬀerent time. We can see that

the type II radio bursts covered a time interval from 02:04:00 to 02:05:53 UT.

Figure 7. Left panel: Temporal evolution of the altitude of the second shock accounting for

the second type II burst. Right panel: Strengths of the magnetic ﬁeld B in the upstream region

of the second shock at diﬀerent altitudes (solid dots), and the red and the black curves are the

results calculated from the empirical model of Dulk and Mclean (1978) given in Equation (5)

and from the modiﬁed model given in Equation (6), respectively.

The value of BDW varies from 0.13 to 0.18, which leads to a density jump (X)

between 1.28 and 1.39, and the Alfv´en Mach number (MA) ranging from 1.22 to

1.30. The mean values of them are (cid:104)BDW (cid:105)= 0.15, (cid:104)X(cid:105) =1.32, and (cid:104)MA(cid:105) =1.25,

respectively. Furthermore, as the shock crossed the CS from 02:04:25 to 02:05:15

UT, the BDW was within the range from 0.18 to 0.14, which leads to a density

jump (X) varying from 1.39 to 1.3, and an Alfv´en Mach number (MA) from 1.30

to 1.23.

The altitude of the second type II burst versus time as shown in left panel of

Figure 7, the shock speed vsh is about 1100 km s−1, and thus the vA is between
840 and 900 km s−1. Bringing the information we could have collected together,

we are able to obtain the magnetic ﬁeld at diﬀerent height and diﬀerent time

as shown in the right panel of Figure 7. The result indicates that the electron

density was within the range from 3.7 to 1.7×108 cm−3, from which we deduced

the magnetic ﬁeld strengths decreasing from 8 G at 1.42 R(cid:12) to 5.4 G at 1.56 R(cid:12)

(see black dots in the right panel of Figure 7). This result could be compared to

that given by the empirical model of Dulk and Mclean (1978):

B = 0.50[(R/R(cid:12)) − 1]−1.5,

(5)

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 20

The broken lane of a type II burst

where R is the heliocentric height, and B is in G. Plotting the results for B

directly calculated from Equation (5) gives the red curve, from which we noticed

that the values of B deduced from the observations in this work are about 6 G

larger than those calculated from Equation (5). Carefully adjusting the factor

in front of parenthesis from 0.50 to 2.15, say

B = 2.15[(R/R(cid:12)) − 1]−1.5,

(6)

and recalculating the values of B in the same height interval, we obtain the black

curve in Figure 7, which is nicely ﬁt to the results deduced for the event studied

in this work.

In addition, the magnetic ﬁeld could also be deduced through an alternative

approach (e.g., Warmuth and Mann, 2005; Cho et al., 2007; Shen and Liu, 2012;

Xue et al., 2014). Using the electron number density ne ≈ 108 cm3 estimated
on the basis of the SDO/AIA in 171 ˚A data, Shen and Liu (2012) calculated

the magnetic ﬁeld B of the open active region coronal loops, and they obtained

B ≈ 4.24 G. In the other cases, Vrˇsnak et al. (2009) also found the ambient

magnetic ﬁeld was about 0.9–1.7 G for the values of electron number density

between 5.0 × 107 and 1.0 × 108 cm−3.

4. Conclusions

Two eruptive events took place successively in the active region AR 11613 from

23:00 UT on November 12, 2012 to 03:00 UT on November 13, 2012. Each event

produced a CME and an M-class ﬂare. The resultant type II radio burst produced

in the ﬁrst event was observed by the spectrometer of HiRAS, and that created

in the second event was observed by the spectrometer of HiRAS and YNAO

simultaneously. The ﬁrst type II radio burst was a regular one with the band-

splitting structure in both the fundamental and harmonic bands with the signal

at the fundamental band less clear; the second one displayed an interesting

broken lane on the harmonic band. Since the second one was detected by both

the dynamic spectrometers at YNAO and HiRAS at 02:04 UT on November 13,

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 21

Gao et al.

2012, we are able to comprehensively investigate the causes of the broken lane

on the harmonic band of the second type II burst.

Observations showed that the ﬁrst CME left a long CS behind it, the second

CME propagated fast, then the broken lane on the harmonic band of the second

type II burst was generated. So we suggest that the fast shock was generated

by the second CME or the second blast wave, that produced the second type

II radio burst with the frequency drifting rate of –0.46 MHz s−1 and the onset

frequency of about 308 MHz for harmonic band. Soon after its formation, the

shock swept the CS, which caused the broken lane of the type II radio burst

observed by both YNAO and HiRAS dynamic spectrometers. The broken lane

of the type II radio burst as a result of the collision of the coronal shock with

the CS inside the helmet streamer has been reported previously (e.g., Kong et

al., 2012; Feng et al., 2012, 2013; Shen et al., 2013). It is the ﬁrst time, to our

knowledge, that the collision between a shock with a post-CME CS may have

been observed. We draw this conclusion because the ﬁrst type II radio burst did

not show any abnormal feature, which indicates no unusual or irregular structure

existing in the way of the associated shock propagating, and the broken lane of

the second type II radio burst occurred when the shock that was responsible for

the second type II burst just went through the CS left behind the ﬁrst CME

(see also Figures 2 through 4).

We note here that no direct evidence for the shock impacting on the CS was

obtained in this event. What we have instead is the indirect evidence that could

be used to deduce a certain scenario that is consistent with observations. So we

are not able to rule out the other possible scenario that might also be consistent

with observations. This is an open question and we need to look into it in detail

in the future.

From the Figures 3 and 4, we estimated the width of CS is about (4–7)

×104 km. On the other side, the thickness of CS also can be calculated according

to the gap width of the broken lane of the type II radio burst resulted from the

shock propagating through the partly open magnetic ﬁeld near the CS. The

time of the shock took to pass through the gap is about 50 s, the shock velocity

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 22

The broken lane of a type II burst

of about 1100 km s−1, so the distance of the shock moving in the CS is about

5.5×104 km. Considering the angle between the shock normal and the CS normal

is unknown, we note that the value should be an upper limit of the CS thickness.

Both values obtained here are consistent with the results obtained for the CS

apparent thickness by the other authors previously (e.g., Lin et al., 2005, 2007,

2009, 2015; Ciaravella and Raymond, 2008; Vrˇsnak et al., 2009; Savage et al.,

2010; Ciaravella et al., 2013).

In addition, the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the source region of each type II

burst was also deduced in diﬀerent ways. First, if we assumed that each shock was

driven by CME as the bow shock, the magnetic ﬁeld was deduced by equating

the Alfv´en speed with the speed of each CME at the moment when the type II

radio burst was generated as a result of the ignition of the CME-driven shock,

and we found that the magnetic ﬁeld strength was 7.5 G at about 1.46 R(cid:12) and

2.6 G at about 1.76 R(cid:12), respectively. Alternatively, if the shock was driven by

the CME as a piston, we obtained that the magnetic ﬁeld was 9.4 G at about

1.46 R(cid:12) and 3.3 G at about 1.76 R(cid:12), respectively. Second, the density jump, X,

across the shock, and then the Alfv´en Mach number, MA, of the shock, could be

estimated from the band-splitting of the type II burst; multiplying MA with the

shock speed gives the local Alfv´en speed, as well as the local magnetic ﬁeld with

a given density model of the corona. Eventually, we found that for the ﬁrst type

II burst, the magnetic ﬁeld was between 1 and 2 G in the height range from 1.7

to 2 R(cid:12); and for the second type II burst with the broken lane, the magnetic

ﬁeld was between 5.4 and 8 G in the height range from 1.42 to 1.56 R(cid:12) (see the

right panel of Figure 7).

On the issue of measuring the thickness of the CME/ﬂare CS, popular ap-

proaches are through analyzing white-light images, the spectral data, and ﬁl-

tergrams in wavelengths suitable for plasma diagnostics of the CS (see the

recent review by Lin et al., 2015 for a detailed discussion). In this work, on

the other hand, we performed plasma diagnostics and estimated the thickness

of the CS through studies of the radio data with high temporal and spectral

resolutions, and obtained the results that are consistent with those obtained via

SOLA: ms.tex; 8 March 2021; 11:20; p. 23

Gao et al.

the other approaches. This indicates that the radio observation of high spectral

and temporal resolution is a very important and valuable supplement to the

other methods for investigating the CME/ﬂare CS.

By analyzing the data from the YNAO radio spectrometer, which possesses

very high spectral resolution and sensitivity, we investigated the process in which

a shock approached and accessed a CME/ﬂare CS as well as the consequences.

Our results indicated that the interaction between the shock and the CS, the

QPE shock turned to the QPA shock yielding the leak of the energetic electrons

bound around the shock and resulting in the type III radio burst near the CS

and the disappearance of the type II radio burst temporarily.
