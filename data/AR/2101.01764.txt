ON ALMOST RATIONAL FINSLER METRICS

EBTSAM H. TAHA AND BANKTESHWAR TIWARI

Abstract. We study a special class of Finsler metrics which we refer to as Almost
Rational Finsler metrics (shortly, AR-Finsler metrics). We give necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for an AR-Finsler manifold (M, F ) to be Riemannian. The rationality of the
associated geometric objects such as Cartan torsion, geodesic spray, Landsberg curvature,
S-curvature, etc is investigated. We prove for a particular subset of AR-Finsler metrics
that if F has isotropic S-curvature, then its S-curvature identically vanishes. Further,
if F has isotropic mean Landsberg curvature, then it is weakly Landsberg. Also, if F
is an Einstein metric, then it is Ricci-ﬂat. Moreover, we show that Randers metric can
not be AR-Finsler metric. Finally, we provide some examples of AR-Finsler metrics and
introduce a new Finsler metric which is called an extended m-th root metric. We show
under what conditions an extended m-th root metric is AR-Finsler metric and study its
generalized Kropina change.

Keywords: Sprays; Finsler geometry; m-th root metrics, (α, β)-metrics; Einstein met-
rics; Generalized Kropina change.

1. Introduction

Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of Riemannian geometry.

It is wider in
scope and richer in content than Riemannian geometry. A Riemannain metric is qua-
dratic in the ﬁber coordinates y while a Finsler metric is not necessary be quadratic in y
cf. [6]. In the literature of Finsler geometry there are some Finsler structures for which
the components of its metric tensor are rational functions in y, for example, Kropina
metrics. The rationality in the ﬁber coordinates y of some geometric objects on Finsler
manifold plays a vital role in its characterization. For example, Randers metrics with
quadratic Riemann curvature have been investigated in [3]. Finsler spaces with rational
spray coeﬃcients have been studied in [9]. Further, in [11], it was proved that Einstein
m-th root metrics are Ricci ﬂat using the rationality of the Riemann curvature of an m-th
root metric.

In this work, we study a class of Finsler metrics, for which the components of its met-
ric tensor gij(x, y) can be written as a product of a ﬁxed function η(x, y) and rational
functions aij(x, y) on the tangent bundle T M (see Deﬁnition 2.1), and call it as Almost
Rational Finsler metric, in short AR-Finsler metric. The rationality of the metric tensor
forces several geometric objects (like spray coeﬃcients, Riemann curvature, Ricci curva-
ture, Berwald curvature, etc.) to have rational functions in y. We explicitly calculate
some geometric objects of an AR-Finsler metric, viz., Cartan torsion, Cartan mean tor-
sion, spray coeﬃcients, Barthel connection and S-curvature. Further, we investigate the
conditions for some Finslerian geometric quantities to be rational functions in y. We also
observe that some geometric objects of an AR-Finsler manifold are always rational and
independent of the rationality of the metric tensor.

It is interesting to note that there are some famous Finsler metrics which are examples
of AR-Finsler metrics. Namely, the generalized Kropina metric, the m-th root metric

cf. [11], the Kropina change of the m-th root metric and the generalized Kropina change
of the m-th root metric [7, 8]. Besides, we introduce a new Finsler metric looks like the
m-th root metric but its coeﬃcients are functions on T M rather than functions on M, as
in the case of m-th root metric, which we refer to as extended m-th root metric. It turns
to be an AR-Finsler metric, when its coeﬃcients are rational functions in y. We show
that its Kropina change as well as generalized Kropina change turn also to be AR-Finsler
metric. We further prove that there is no AR-Finsler metric of Randers type. The poly-
nomial (α, β)-metric has been studied by Z. Shen in [6]. In this paper, we study a special
polynomial (α, β)-metric and ﬁnd the condition to be an AR-Finsler metric.

Some AR-Finsler metrics F are rational in y while others not. We prove the fol-
lowing two results for irrational F that i) if (M, F ) is an AR-Finsler space of isotropic
S-curvature, then its S-curvature identically vanishes; ii) an AR-Finsler space which has
isotropic mean Landsberg curvature reduces to weakly Landsberg space. It is an exten-
sion of [8, Theorem 1.4]. Further, we show for certain η that if (M, F ) is an AR-Finsler
space of Einstein type, then it has vanishing Ricci curvature. This result represents a
generalization of [11, Theorem 1.1] and [9, Theorem 1.1].

In what follows, we give the structure of this paper. Section 2 deals with basic prelim-
inaries required for the rest of this work. In section 3, we deﬁne Almost Rational Finsler
metric and study some of its characterizations and associated geometric quantities. We
give necessary and suﬃcient for an AR-Finsler manifold to be Riemannian. We extend
the results [8, Theorem 1.4], [11, Theorem 1.1] and [9, Theorem 1.1]. Further, we show
that no nontrivial Randers metrics is AR-Finsler. In section 4, we give some examples
AR-Finsler metrics such as Kropina metric, generalized Kropina metric and m-th root
metric. Also, we introduce the so called extended m-th root metric and ﬁgure out its
generalized Kropina change.

2. Preliminaries

Let M be a smooth n-dimensional manifold and T M be the corresponding tangent
bundle. Let (xi) be the coordinates of any point of the base manifold M and (yi) be a
supporting element at the same point. The partial diﬀerentiation with respect to xi is
denoted by ∂i, while the partial diﬀerentiation with respect to yi (basis vector ﬁelds of
the vertical bundle) is denoted by ˙∂i. Let us recall some basics of Finsler geometry. Most
of the material presented here with further details may be found in [6]. Hereafter, the
Einstein summation convention is in place.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A Finsler structure F on a smooth manifold M is a mapping

F : T M → [0, ∞)

with the following properties:

(a) F is C ∞ on the slit tangent bundle T M\{0}.
(b) F (x, y) is positively homogeneous of ﬁrst degree in y: F (x, λy) = λF (x, y) for all

y ∈ T M and λ > 0.

(c) The Hessian matrix gij(x, y) := 1
2

˙∂i ˙∂jF 2 is positive-deﬁnite at each point of T M\{0}.

The bilinear symmetric form g = gij(x, y) dxi ⊗ dxj is called the Finsler metric tensor or
fundamental tensor of the Finsler manifold (M, F ).

Often, a function F satisﬁes the above mentioned conditions is called a regular Finsler
metric. Instead of positive deﬁnite, if the metric tensor g is non-degenerate at each point of
T M\{0}, the pair (M, F ) is called a pseudo-Finsler manifold. If F satisﬁes the conditions

ON ALMOST RATIONAL FINSLER METRICS

(a)-(c) on an open conic subset U of T M (for every v ∈ U and µ > 0, µv ∈ U), then F is
called conic Finsler metric.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The Cartan torsion associated with a Finsler metric F is given by C =
˙∂i ˙∂j ˙∂kF 2. The mean Cartan torsion is
˙∂kgij = 1
Cijk dxi ⊗ dxj ⊗ dxk, where Cijk = 1
4
2
denoted by I = Ik dxk, where Ik = gij Cijk.

An immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of the Cartan tensor is that a Finsler man-
ifold is Riemannian if and only if Cijk = 0. Deicke proved, in [2], that a regular Finsler
metric is Riemannian if and only if Ik vanishes.

In 1941, Randers metrics were ﬁrst studied by the physicist G. Randers, from the stand-
point of general relativity [5]. Further, in 1957, R. S. Ingarden applied Randers metrics to
the theory of the electron microscope and named them Randers metrics. A Finsler man-
αij(x) yi yj is a Riemannian
ifold (M, F ) is of Randers type if F = α + β, where α =
metric and β = bi(x) dxi is a 1-form on M with ||β||α =
αij(x) bi(x) bj(x) < 1. The
metric F is then said to be a Randers metric. As a generalization of Randers metric, M.
Matsumoto introduced (α, β)-metrics in [4].

It is worth noting that for a Riemannian metric F , the spray coeﬃcients Gi(x, y)
are quadratic in y, whereas for Finsler metric they are highly nonlinear cf. [1, 6]. The

3. Almost rational Finsler metrics

Deﬁnition 3.1. A Finsler metric F on a manifold M is called Almost Rational Finsler
(simply, AR-Finsler) metric if the coeﬃcients gij(x, y) of its metric tensor can be expressed
as follows:

(11)

where

gij(x, y) = η(x, y) aij(x, y),

(a) η : T M −→ [0, ∞) is a smooth function,
(b) the matrix (aij(x, y))1≤i,j≤n is symmetric positive deﬁnite with each aij(x, y) be a

rational function in the ﬁber coordinate y,

(c) {η(x, y) aij(x, y)} is positive homogeneous of degree zero in y for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.
The pair (M, F ) is said to be AR-Finsler manifold. In addition if η is a rational function
in y, we call F as rational Finsler metric and the pair (M, F ) as rational Finsler structure.

ON ALMOST RATIONAL FINSLER METRICS

If we relax condition (b) as the matrix (aij(x, y))1≤i,j≤n is nondegenerate (respectively,
degenerate) then, we deal with pseudo or nondegenerate (respectively, degenerate) AR-
Finsler metric.

Remark 3.2. It is clear that from expression (11), the metric tensor gij(x, y) are rational
functions in y if and only if η is a rational function in y. For example, in [10, Examples
3, 4] the function η is a rational function in y.

Lemma 3.3. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold. Then we have the following:

η (x, y) is rational in y,

(1) The function F 2
(2) The inverse metric tensor of F is given by gij(x, y) = aij (x,y)
η(x,y) ,
(3) The expression {η ˙∂iajk + ajk ˙∂iη} is symmetric in the indices i, j, k.

Proof. (1) follows directly from the fact that the multiplication of rational functions always
results a rational function and F 2
η (x, y) = aij(x, y) yi yj. (2) is straight forward from the
˙∂kgij,
fact gij gik = δk
(cid:3)
which is totally symmetric in its indices.

j . (3) follows by plugging (11) into the Cartan torsion formula Cijk = 1
2

Proposition 3.4. Let (M, F ) be an n-dimensional AR-Finsler manifold, n ≥ 2. Then,
the function ˙∂i log(η(x, y)) is a rational function in y for all i = 1, ..., n.

Proof. It is clear that 2Cijk = 2Ckij. That is, in the view of Lemma 3.3 (3),

η ˙∂iajk + ajk ˙∂iη = η ˙∂kaij + aij ˙∂kη ⇐⇒

η

˙∂iajk − ˙∂kaij

= −ajk

˙∂iη + aij

˙∂kη.

Multiplying both sides of the previous relation by aji, we get

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

η aji

˙∂iajk − ˙∂kaij
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

= −δi
k

˙∂iη + n ˙∂kη = (n − 1) ˙∂kη.

Thus, we have

(12)

Therefore,

˙∂k log(η) =

1
n − 1

aji

˙∂iajk − ˙∂kaij

.

˙∂k log (η(x, y)) are rational functions in y.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:3)

It is known that the partial derivatives ˙∂k and ∂l commutes. Also, the diﬀerential of
any rational function f (x, y) in y with respect to x remains rational in y, thereby, we
have:
Corollary 3.5. The function ˙∂k∂k1∂k2...∂kr log (η(x, y)) is a rational function in y for all
1 ≤ k, k1, ..., kr ≤ n, r ∈ N.

Remark 3.6. Given an AR-Finsler manifold, the rationality of the associated Cartan
torsion Cijk(x, y) in y depends on the rationality of the function η in y. This results from
the expression

Cijk = η ˙∂iajk + ajk ˙∂iη.
In other words, Cijk(x, y) are rational functions in y if and only if η is rational function in
y. However, the following proposition shows that rationality of the mean Cartan torsion
of an AR-Finsler manifold is independent of the rationality of the function η.

Proposition 3.7. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold. Then, the mean Cartan torsion
is rational in y.

(13)

Ii = gjk Cijk =

η ˙∂iajk + ajk ˙∂iη

= ajk ˙∂iajk + n ˙∂i log(η).

Therefore, the proof is completed by the use of Proposition 3.4.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:3)

In the view of formulae (12) and (13), we have the following result.

Corollary 3.8. Let (M, F ) be an n-dimensional AR-Finsler manifold, n ≥ 2. Then, the
mean Cartan torsion Ik can be expressed as follows:

Proposition 3.9. Let (M, F ) be an n-dimensional AR-Finsler manifold. Then, we have

aij aij|k,

where | is the horizontal covariant derivative with respect to the Berwald connection.

Proof. It is known that gij|k = 0. Thus, by (11), we obtain

0 = (η aij)|k = η|k aij + η aij|k = (δkη) aij + η aij|k ⇐⇒ (δkη) aij = −η aij|k.

Then, we have

aij δk log(η) = −aij|k.
Hence, the proof is completed by multiplying both sides of the last relation by aij and
(cid:3)
taking into account aij aij = n.

Theorem 3.10. Let (M, F ) be a regular AR-Finsler manifold. Then, (M, F ) is Rie-
mannian if and only if the functions ˙∂i log(η) have the following form:

(15)

˙∂i log(η) = −

ajk ˙∂iajk

Proof. Suppose (M, F ) is Riemannian. Thus, Cijk = 0, this means that,

0 = η ˙∂iajk + ajk ˙∂iη =⇒ ajk ˙∂i log(η) = − ˙∂iajk =⇒ n ˙∂i log(η) = −ajk ˙∂iajk.

For the converse, assume that ˙∂i log(η) = − 1

n ajk ˙∂iajk. Then, we get

n ˙∂i log(η) = −ajk ˙∂iajk =⇒ n ˙∂iη = −η ajk ˙∂iajk =⇒ ajk ajk ˙∂iη = −η ajk ˙∂iajk
⇐⇒ ajk (η ˙∂iajk + ajk ˙∂iη) = 0 ⇐⇒ ajk Cijk = 0.

In view of Lemma 3.3 (2),

Therefore, (M, F ) is Riemannian space by Deicke’s theorem [2].

ajk Cijk = 0 =⇒

ajk Cijk = 0 ⇐⇒ gjk Cijk = 0 ⇐⇒ Ii = 0.

Thus, S-curvature is rational function in y if and only if the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are

∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational in y.

Proof. It follows from Propositions 3.13 together with formulae (9) and (10) along with
(cid:3)
using the fact that the multiplication of rational functions is rational.

It is worth mentioning that some Finsler structures F are rational in y while others are
not. For example, Kropina metric is rational in y, generalized Kropina metric F (x, y) =
αk+1
βk , where k is an even number, is not rational function in y (see section 4, for details).
The following result holds only when a Finsler metric F is not rational function in y.

Theorem 3.17. Let (M, F, dV ) be an AR-Finsler manifold equipped with an arbitrary
volume form such that F (x, y) is not rational in y and the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are
rational in y.
If (M, F, dV ) has isotropic S-curvature, then (M, F ) has vanishing S-
curvature.

Proof. A Finsler metric F is said to have isotopic S-curvature if there exists a function A
in M such that

S(x, y) = (n + 1) A(x) F (x, y).
Assume that the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational in y. Then, by Proposition 3.7, the
S-curvature is rational in y, on the other hand F (x, y) is not rational in y by hypothesis.
(cid:3)
Therefore, S identically vanishes.

Proposition 3.18. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold. Then, the Douglas curvature
components Di
jkl are rational functions in y if and only if the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are
rational in y.
Proof. It results from Proposition 3.13 and Corollary 3.15 together with formula (5). (cid:3)

Proposition 3.19. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold, n ≥ 2. Then, the Landsberg
curvature components Lijk are rational functions in y if and only if ∂i log (η(x, y)) are
rational functions in y.

Proof. It results by making use of Corollary 3.15 along with the formula

Lijk =

ymgms Gs

ijk.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.20. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold with n ≥ 2. Then, the mean
Landsberg curvature Jk(x, y) are rational functions in y if and only if ∂k log (η(x, y)) are
rational functions in y.

Proof. Proposition 3.7 reads that the functions Ik(x, y) are rational in y. Thereby, ∂iIk(x, y)
and ˙∂iIk(x, y) are rational functions in y. Propositions 3.12 and 3.13 say that the ratio-
nally of the quantities Gs(x, y) and N s
k (x, y) in y is equivalent to the rationally of the
(cid:3)
functions ∂k log (η(x, y)) in y. Thus, by formula (3), the proof is completed.

Theorem 3.21. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold with n ≥ 2 such that F (x, y) is
not a rational function in y and the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational in y. If (M, F )
has isotropic mean Landsberg curvature, then (M, F ) is weakly Landsberg manifold.

Proof. It is clear from Lemma 3.20 that Jk(x, y) are rational functions in y. Suppose
(M, F ) is an isotropic mean Landsberg manifold, that is J can be written as in (4). But
F is not rational function in y, by our assumption, and I is rational in y by Proposi-
tion 3.7. Therefore, by formula (4), J must identically vanishes. Thus, (M, F ) is a weakly
(cid:3)
Landsberg manifold.

Proposition 3.22. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold, n ≥ 2. Then, the Riemannian
curvature is a rational function in y if and only if the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational
in y for. Consequently, the Weyl curvature and χ-curvature are rational in y if and only
if ∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational functions in y.

Proof. Let F be an AR-Finsler metric such that ∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational functions in
It is clear from Propositions 3.12 that Gi(x, y) are rational functions in y. Thus,

∂kGi(x, y) are rational functions in y as the diﬀerentiation with respect to the manifold
coordinates ∂k is not aﬀecting the rationality of Gi(x, y) in y. Also the product of rational
functions is a rational function, considering (6) leads to the rationality of Ri
k(x, y) in y.
(cid:3)
Similarly, by formulae (7) and (8) the proof is completed.

The following result holds only in case of the AR-Finsler metrics with η is not a rational
It may be considered as a generalization of [11, Theorem 1.1] and [9,

function in y.
Theorem 1.1].

Theorem 3.23. Let (M, F ) be an AR-Finsler manifold n ≥ 2 such that the function η is
not rational in y and the functions ∂i log (η(x, y)) are rational in y. If F is an Einstein
metric then it is Ricci-ﬂat.

Proof. By Propositions 3.22, Ric = Ri
is an Einstein metric, that is,

i is a rational function in y. By our postulates, F

Ric = (n − 1) K F 2, where K ∈ C ∞(M).

The function η is not rational in y thereby, F 2 = η aij yi yj is not rational function in y.
(cid:3)
Hence, K = 0 which means Ric = 0.

Remark 3.24. It may be remarked here that we can not expect all irrational Finsler
metrics gij in the form of (11). For example, Shen’s circles with radius 1 and centered at
(0, 0) cf. [3]. Let M = R2 equipped with the following Finsler metric of Randers type

F (x, y) = F (x1, x2; y1, y2) =

(y1)2 + (y2)2 + A(x1, x2) (y1 + y2),

where A(x1, x2) ∈ C ∞(M). It is easy to see that, the associated metric tensor has the
following components:

p

g11 = 1 + A2(x1, x2) + A(x1, x2)

g22 = 1 + A2(x1, x2) + A(x1, x2)

The Shen’s circles example motivates us to study the case of Randers metrics which

leads to the following result.

Remark 3.26. It should be noted that, Randers metrics of Berwald type cf. [6] (in which
β is parallel with respect to α) are examples of non AR-Finsler metrics with rational,
more precisely quadratic, spray coeﬃcients.

4. Examples of AR-Finsler metrics

In this section we study some examples of AR-Finsler metrics.

The generalized Kropina metric.

The Finsler function of generalized Kropina metric is deﬁned by F = α φ(s) where
sm , m 6= 0, −1. By substituting in formula (1), the metric tensor is given by

φ(s) = 1

α s2m+1 = 1
functions
are rational func-
tions in y when m is integer and irrational functions in y when m not integer. Which
leads to the metric (18) is rational in y when m is integer. Further, expression (18) can
be written as follows:

(cid:17)
αij (x) yi yj
bi(x) bj (x) yi yj

αij (x) yi yj
bi(x) bj (x) yi yj

It should be noted that, the functions aij(x, y) are rational in y. Hence, the generalized

Kropina metric is an AR-Finsler metric. By direct calculations, we get

˙∂r log(η(x, y)) = −2m

br(x)
bi(x) yi + 2m

yi∂rbi(x)
bi(x) yi + m

are rational functions in y.

Remark 4.1. In particular for k = 1, F is the well known Kropina metric, which has
been studied in details in [4, 6].

The special polynomial (α, β)-metric.

Let F := α φ(s) where φ(s) = a sk + b sm, m = k(mod)2 such that

a (m − 1) sm + b (k − 1) sk > 0,

|s| < bo.

By straight forward calculations, we get
gij = −(a sm + b sk){a (m − 1) sm + b (k − 1) sk} αij

Therefore, gij are rational functions in y. Indeed, the coeﬃcients of αij(x) are linear
combination of the terms s2m, s2k and sn+k which are rational functions in y. Similarly,
the coeﬃcients of bi(x) bj(x) are the linear combination of s2m−2, s2k−2 and sk+m−2, which
are also rational functions in y. The last term in gij is the product of rational functions
in y, namely 1
β , with the linear combination of the functions s2m, s2k, sk+m. It may
be noted here that the term s
α2 itself is rational in y. Since gij is a rational function
in y, we get

s α = 1

α = β

The m-th root metric.

˙∂i log(η(x, y)) = 0 = ∂i log(η(x, y)).

The Finsler mapping of the m-th root type is deﬁned by, cf. [11],

(19)

F (x, y) :=

ai1i2...im(x) yi1 yi2 ... yim

1

m .

In fact, F (x, y) is a rational function in y if and only if it is quadratic in y, that is F is
Riemannian. In addition, F is positive deﬁnite when m is even. It is clear that for m ≥ 3
and n ≥ 2, the m-th root metric is an irrational function in y.

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

EBTSAM H. TAHA AND BANKTESHWAR TIWARI

Let the polynomial

(20)

A := ai1i2...im(x) yi1 yi2 ... yim = F m.

Thereby, its fundamental metric tensor has the following components,

Obviously, η(x, y) is an irrational positive homogeneous function of degree (2 − m) in y
and aij(x, y) are rational positive homogeneous functions of degree (m−2) in y. By direct
calculations, we get

˙∂i log(η(x, y)) =

Remark 4.2. A special case of (19) is the Finsler metric F (x, y) = f (x) (y1y2y3)
3 which
deﬁned in the conic domain D = T R3 − {(xi, yi) ∈ T R3 | yi 6= 0}. It is an AR-Finsler
manifold which does not admit a semi-concurrent vector ﬁeld [10, Remark 3.13].

where µi1i2...im(x, y) symmetric in all indices, positive homogeneous of degree (0) in y. In

metric (21) is irrational function in y. Let

A(x, y) = µi1i2...im(x, y) yi1 yi2 ... yim = F m.

in y and aij(x, y) are rational positive homogeneous functions of degree (m − 2) in y.
Consequently, F is an AR-Finsler metric.
