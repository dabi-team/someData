Abstract 

At  30-50  K,  the  temperatures  typical  for  surfaces  in  the  Kuiper  Belt  (e.g.  Stern  &  Trafton 
2008), only seven species have sublimation pressures higher than 1 nbar (Fray & Schmitt 2009): 
Ne, N2, CO, Ar, O2, CH4, and Kr. Of these, N2, CO, and CH4 have been detected or inferred on 
the surfaces of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). The presence of tenuous atmospheres above 
these  volatile  ices  depends  on  the  sublimation  pressures,  which  are  very  sensitive  to  the 
composition,  temperatures,  and  mixing  states  of  the  volatile  ices.  Therefore,  the  retention  of 
volatiles  on  a  TNO  is  related  to  its  formation  environment  and  thermal  history.  The  surface 
volatiles  may  be  transported  via  seasonally  varying  atmospheres  and  their  condensation  might 
be responsible for the high surface albedos of some of these bodies. The most sensitive searches 
for  tenuous  atmospheres  are  made  by  the  method  of  stellar  occultation,  which  have  been  vital 
for the study of the atmospheres of Triton and Pluto, and has to-date placed upper limits on the 
atmospheres of 11 other bodies. The recent release of the Gaia astrometric catalog has led to a 
"golden  age"  in  the  ability  to  predict  TNO  occultations  in  order  to  increase  the  observational 
data base.

Introduction 

Several  bodies  in  the  Transneptunian  region  have  volatiles  on  their  surfaces  that  have 
significant vapor pressures at the temperatures of the outer solar system: CH4, N2, and CO (with 
CO  only  detected  on  Pluto  and  Triton).  When  present,  volatiles  may  raise  significant 
atmospheres  around  these  bodies  at  some  times  during  the  orbit  of  these  Trans-Neptunian 
Objects  (TNOs).  These  would  be  vapor-pressure  supported  atmospheres,  where  the  main 
atmospheric  species  exists  also  as  a  surface  ice,  and  the  surface  pressure  is  a  very  sensitive 
function of that ice’s temperature. Mars, Pluto, Triton, and, to some extent, Io are examples of 
vapor-pressure  supported  atmospheres.  If,  as  expected,  Eris,  Makemake,  and  other  TNOs  are 
occasionally in this class at some time in their orbit, then vapor-pressure supported atmospheres 
would  be  more  numerous  than  terrestrial  atmospheres  (Venus,  Earth,  Titan),  or  gas  giants.

Rather than an oddity, vapor-pressure supported atmospheres may be the most common style of 
atmosphere in our solar system. These atmospheres are characterized by large seasonal pressure 
variations, and global transport of volatiles across the surface.  

Vapor-pressure supported atmospheres may have been important in the evolution of the outer 
solar system. All the TNOs should have formed with some measure of these species, but not all 
TNOs  have  volatiles  detected  on  their  surface.  The  explanation  is  tied  to  the  gaseous  phase 
through atmospheric escape.  

The  atmospheres  of  Pluto  and  Triton  have  been  extensively  studied,  by  spacecraft,  ground-
based  occultations  and  spectroscopy,  and  modeling.  Great  effort  has  been  made  to  search  for 
atmospheres around other TNOs. To date, only upper limits have been placed.  

2.  Spectral evidence of N2, CO, and CH4 on the surfaces of TNOs 

Methane  ice  has  been  reported  or  inferred  on  the  surfaces  Triton,  Pluto,  Eris,  Makemake, 
Quaoar,  Varuna,  Sedna,  and  2007  OR10.  CO  and  N2  ices  have  been  directly  detected  on  Pluto 
and  Triton.  N2  ice  has  been  inferred  from  its  effect  on  the  CH4-dominated  spectra  of  Eris  and 
Makemake,  and  possibly  Quaoar  and  Sedna.  We  detail  the  evidence  for  the  presence  of  such 
ices below and summarize it in Table 1. See deBergh et al 2013, Brown 2008, 2012, and Grasset 
et al. 2017 for earlier reviews, and the chapter by Barucci and Merlin (2019, this volume) for 
more general discussion of the composition of TNO surfaces. Despite attempts to characterize 
surface  compositions  with  photometric  systems  (Trujillo  et  al.  2011,  DalleOre  et  al.  2015), 
spectral resolution of at least 500 seems to be needed for definitive detections of volatile ices, 
and we focus on spectral data below. 

Triton: We consider Triton in the discussion of volatiles on Trans Neptunian Objects, even 
though it is a moon of Neptune, because it is thought to be a captured TNO (McKinnon & Leith 
1995).  and,  more  frivolously,  its  orbit  clearly  crosses  that  of  Neptune.  Its  surface  and 
atmospheric  properties  are  usefully  compared  to  those  of  Pluto  and  other  large  TNOs.    The 
volatiles, N2 and CH4, were measured in Triton’s atmosphere by Voyager during its 1989 flyby 
with  its  UV  spectrometer  (Broadfoot  et  al.  1989).  Three  relatively  volatile  ices,  N2,  CH4,  and 
CO,  and  two  non-volatile  ices,  CO2  and  H2O,  were  detected  on  Triton’s  surface  from  ground-
based  near-IR  spectroscopy  (Cruikshank  et  al.  1993,  Cruikshank  et  al.  2000).  Noting  that  the 
spectral  profile  of  the  2.15-µm  N2  absorption  band  is  temperature  dependent,  and  transitions 
from very broad for the higher-temperature hexagonal β-N2 phase above 35.61 K to very narrow 
for the colder cubic α-N2 phase, Quirico et al. (1999) showed that the N2 ice was in the warmer 
β phase on Triton. Additionally, the spectrum of CH4 ice diluted in N2 is shifted toward shorter 
wavelengths  with  respect  to  pure  CH4  ice  (Quirico  &  Schmitt  1997;  Protopapa  et  al.  2015). 
Therefore it was concluded that solid CH4 on Triton exists predominantly diluted in N2 (Quirico 
et al. 1999), with subsequent observations suggesting the presence of some pure CH4 ice (Merlin 
et al. 2018). These ices are not uniformly distributed across Triton’s surface, as seen from the 
variation  of  its  spectrum  with  sub-observer  longitude  as  the  body  rotates  (Grundy  &  Young 
2004, Grundy et al.  2010, Holler et al. 2016). These studies suggest that the non-volatiles H2O 
and CO2 may dominate the terrains nearest Triton’s current summer pole, that the more volatile 
species,  N2  and  CO,  are  co-located,  and  that  the  CH4  distribution  and  mixing  state  may  vary 
with depth and longitude. Furthermore, there is evidence for isolated areas of CH4 diluted in N2 
that is too fine-grained to allow direct detection of the inherently weak 2.15 µm N2 band, where 
the presence of the N2 is revealed only by its effect of shifting the CH4 spectrum. Further clues

to  the  distribution  of  Triton’s  ices  comes  from  a  long  time  base  of  observations  and  Triton’s 
changing aspect. Infrared spectra from 1986 to 1992 — approaching Triton’s summer solstice in 
2000 — show a dramatic decrease in Triton’s 2.2-2.4 μm CH4 band (Brown et al. 1995), while 
post-solstice  spectra  2002-2014  show  a  mild  increase  in  CH4  band  depth  (Holler  et  al.  2016), 
suggesting a combination of changing aspect and perhaps active volatile transport. Voyager flew 
no  infrared  spectrometer,  and  so  it  is  likely  that  these  speculations  will  remain  unconfirmed 
until a mission to Neptune/Triton can fly an infrared spectrometer.   

Pluto:  Pluto’s  surface  has  been  studied  with  disk-integrated  ground-based  spectra  in  the 
visible,  near  infrared  and  mid  infrared  (see  the  review  by  Cruikshank  et  al.  2015)  and  at 
geologically relevant spatial scales by the LEISA infrared spectrometer and MVIC color imager 
on  NASA’s  New  Horizons  spacecraft  (see  chapter  by  Spencer  et  al.).  The  N2  ice  on  Pluto  is 
concentrated  in  a  large,  deep,  N2-filled  basin  called  Sputnik  Planitia,  near  the  equator  and 
opposite Charon, in which some CO and CH4 is diluted in solid solution with large-grained or 
annealed  β-N2.  N2-rich  ice  of  similar  composition  is  also  seen  at  mid  latitudes,  35-55°  N 
(Protopapa et al. 2017; Schmitt et al. 2017). It is now understood that Pluto has more CH4 than 
Triton  overall.  Areas  of  CH4-rich  ice  was  first  inferred  from  ground-based  spectra,  and  were 
mapped with the LEISA spectrometer to be predominately (i) at a northern cap, north of ~55°N, 
(ii)  in  a  band  from  20-35°N,  and  (iii)  on  the  area  named  Tartarus  Dorsae  on  the  eastern 
terminator limb of the encounter hemisphere near 220° to 250° E, 10°S to 30° N.  

Eris:  The  visible  and  near-infrared  spectrum  of  Eris  clearly  shows  strong  CH4  absorption 
features  (Brown  et  al  2005;  see  review  by  Brown  2008  and  analysis  by  Tegler  et  al.  2012). 
Absorption at 1.684 µm indicates pure CH4 or CH4-rich ice (Dumas et al. 2007), and the spectral 
shifts are much smaller than for either Triton or Pluto spectra. The depth, shape, and the precise 
wavelengths of the CH4 features on Eris can be modeled to derive grain size, dilution state, and 
stratification of CH4 ice, even without the direct detection of the N2 feature (e.g., Merlin et al. 
2009).  The  issue  of  stratification—i.e.,  whether  the  CH4  concentration  state  is  constant  or 
varying with depth—is particularly interesting because it relates to the evolution of Eris’s ices 
over  its  561-year  orbit,  which  in  turn  is  determined  by  the  order  in  which  different  species 
freeze  out  onto  the  surface  each  orbit  after  perihelion.  Different  studies  have  disagreed  on  the 
stratification,  variously  concluding  that  the  dilute  CH4  lies  above  pure  CH4  (Licandro  et  al. 
2006a), below pure CH4 (Abernathy et al. 2009), sandwiched between two layers of pure CH4 
(Merlin  et  al.  2009),  or  that  the  stoichiometry  of  CH4:N2  is  constant  with  depth  (Tegler  et  al. 
2012).  Clearly,  better  data  and  continued  modeling  is  needed  on  this  question.  Eris’s  surface 
temperature is almost certainly below the α-β phase transition for N2 (Sicardy et al. 2011), given 
its  bright  geometric  albedo  pV  =  0.96.  Since  the  α-N2  absorption  feature  is  weaker  and  much 
narrower than that of β-N2, it has eluded direct detection on Eris. 

Makemake:  Very  strong  CH4  absorption  is  seen  in  the  visible  and  infrared  spectrum  of 
Makemake with spectral shifts to shorter wavelengths, but with smaller shifts than are seen on 
Eris, Pluto, or Triton (Licandro et al. 2006b, Brown et al. 2007, Tegler et al 2007, 2008, Lorenzi 
et al. 2015, Perna 2017). This suggests that although some CH4 is in solution with N2, N2 itself is 
not as prevalent on Makemake as on the previous three bodies. At visible wavelengths, Tegler et 
al  (2007)  detected  four  absorption  features  between  0.54  and  0.62  µm  that  they  attributed  to 
CH4, but ice-phase laboratory spectra of these features are lacking. The non-volatile irradiation 
products of CH4 are also seen on Makemake (Brown et al. 2015). 

Quaoar: The spectrum of Quaoar is dominated by H2O ice, analogous to H2O-rich Charon. 
Jewitt & Luu (2004) interpreted absorption near 1.65 µm as crystalline water ice and absorption 
near 2.2 µm as ammonia hydrate, and reported no detected CH4 absorption. Improved SNR at

2.2-2.4 µm strengthened the case for CH4 in the spectrum (Schaller & Brown 2007b), which, if 
real, was nevertheless subtle when superimposed on the significant H2O absorption. Guilbert et 
al.  (2009)  claim  a  marginal  detection  (2  ±  2%  deep)  of  the  1.724  µm  feature  due  to  CH4  ice, 
which they say adds weight to the attribution of CH4 ice for the 2.2 µm feature. Dalle Ore et al. 
(2009)  model  the  near-IR  spectrum  plus  photometry  at  3.6  and  4.5  µm  using  CH4  to  explain 
both the 2.2 µm absorption and the mid-IR photometry, with no need for ammonia hydrate, and 
propose  that  N2  ice  in  the  β-phase  may  cover  20%  of  the  surface,  as  seen  by  relatively  subtle 
effects near 2.15 µm and by photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 µm. Barucci et al. (2015) investigate the 
1.67 µm CH4 band, and N2 implied by the shifts in the 1.67 µm CH4 band, but measuring this 
shift is complicated by the broad 1.65 µm crystalline H2O band. In short, on Quaoar strong H2O 
bands complicate the definitive detection and analysis of CH4, and the derived presence of N2 
from CH4 shifts. 

2007  OR10:  The  large  TNO  2007  OR10  (Pál  et  al.  2016)  shows  an  extremely  red  visible 
spectrum, and its near-IR spectrum shows water-ice absorption (Brown et al. 2011). 2007 OR10 
shares  both  traits  with  Quaoar.  This  similarity  with  Quaoar  is  indirect  evidence  that  CH4  may 
also  be  present  on  2007  OR10  (Brown  et  al.,  2011),  if  one  accepts  both  the  equivalence  of 
surface type, and the evidence of CH4 on Quaoar. Both Quaoar and 2007 OR10 are near the CH4 
retention line of Schaller and Brown (2007a), see Section 4. 

Sedna:  Distant  Sedna,  currently  at  ~85  AU,  has  a  spectrum  that  is  difficult  to  interpret. 
Barucci et al. (2005) reported hints of a Triton-like spectrum with β-N2 (an unexpected N2 phase 
at Sedna’s distance) and CH4, from spectra with a spectral resolution of only 100 in the near-IR, 
while Trujilo et al. (2005) reported a featureless spectrum, from spectra at a binned resolution of 
215 near 2.15 µm. Near-infrared spectra were analyzed in combination with Spitzer photometry 
at 3.6 and 4.5 μm (Barucci et al. 2010, Emery et al. 2007). No diagnostic CH4 absorption bands 
were evident, but a decrease in albedo longward of 2.2 µm was interpreted as due to CH4 and 
C2H6 (ethane), or possibly serpentine, and the addition of N2 was also consistent with the Spitzer 
photometry (Barucci et al., 2010). The surface appears heterogeneous (Barucci et al. 2010). 

Varuna: The spectrum of Varuna is in general well explained by various non-volatiles, such 
as water ice, olivine, pyroxene, tholin, and amorphous carbon as a darkening agent. The strong 
CH4 absorption bands at 1.67, 1.72, 1.8, or 2.21 µm are not detected in the current best spectra 
(Lorenzi et al. 2014), limiting the amount of CH4 ice to less than 10% of the surface. Lorenzi et 
al. (2014) discuss how the addition a small amount methane ice slightly improves the match to 
the data, but as their data have a spectral resolution of only 50, further work is critically needed 
to confirm or constrain CH4 on Varuna. 

Orcus:  The  water-dominated  near-infrared  spectrum  of  Orcus  (de  Bergh  et  al.  2005, 
Fornasier  et  al.  2004,  Trujillo  et  al.  2005)  has  an  absorption  feature  near  2.2  µm,  compatible 
+  (Barucci  et  al.  2008;  Delsanti  et  al.  2010;  Carry  et  al. 
with  absorption  by  CH4,  NH3,  or  NH4
2011; DeMeo et al. 2010). Because of the lack of other CH4 absorptions, specifically those near 
1.67 and 1.72 μm, it is likely that CH4 is not the main cause of the 2.2 µm absorption feature.

3. Volatile-supported atmospheres 

For a TNO with little or no atmosphere, the equilibrium surface temperature, T0 will depend 
on its rotation rate and thermal inertia (i.e. fast vs. slow rotator), latitude (λ), sub-solar latitude 
(λsol),  and  time  of  day  (e.g.,  hour  angle  of  the  sun,  h).  The  simplest  approach  is  to  assume 
thermal emission balances absorbed insolation, and that the atmosphere is nearly transparent, in 
which case the equilibrium surface temperature is: 

(1) 

 𝜖𝜎𝑇!

!    = 𝜇(𝜆, 𝜆!"#, ℎ)   

!!!"(!!!)
!!!

where  𝜖 is the emissivity, σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, S1AU is the normal solar insolation 
at  1  AU  (1367  W  m-2),  A  is  the  bolometric  Bond  albedo,  and  R  is  the  heliocentric  distance  in 
AU. 𝜇(𝜆, 𝜆!"#, ℎ) is the average cosine of the incidence angle for the problem at hand: for the 
sub-solar  temperature  on  a  slow  rotator,  Tss,  𝜇 = 1;  for  the  equatorial  latitude  for  fast  rotator, 
𝜇 = 1/𝜋; for a single characteristic equilibrium temperature balancing the global average of the 
insolation, Teq, 𝜇 = 1/4. 𝜂 is the so-called “beaming factor” (e.g., Spencer 1990, Harris 1998, 
Müller et al. 2010, Lellouch et al. 2013), which can raise the temperature for a rough surface (or 
lower it for a body with high thermal inertia in some models of thermal emission). Many of the 
smaller TNOs have A ≈ 5%, while the largest TNOs have  A ≈ 60-80% (Lellouch et al. 2013). 
Thus, the temperatures relevant for TNOs range from Tss ≈ 70 K for 𝜖=1, 𝜂=1, A = 5% at R=30 
AU down to Teq ≈ 20 K for 𝜖  = 1, 𝜂  = 1, A = 80% at 90 AU. Detached objects at R much greater 
90 AU will have even colder temperatures. Eq (1) ignores latent heat of sublimation and internal 
heat flux, and the conduction of heat into or from the subsurface is empirically included in the 
beaming factor. 

The  surface  pressure  of  an  atmosphere  over  a  pure  ice  in  thermodynamic  equilibrium  (the 
sublimation pressure, ps(T0)) is a function only of the ice temperature (Fray & Schmitt 2009). Of 
the three super-volatiles seen in the outer solar system, N2, CO, and CH4, N2 is by far the most 
volatile (Fig 1). TNOs with volatiles show a mix of ices: CH4 or CO diluted in N2-rich ice; N2 or 
CO  diluted  in  CH4-rich  ice;  or  pure  CH4  ices.  The  mixtures  present  complicated  surface-ice 
interaction,  including  lag  deposits  and  the  influence  of  CH4-rich  warm  patches  (see  review  by 
Trafton et al. 1998). Trafton (2015) and Tan and Kargel (2018) have more recent work on the 
mixtures,  including  the  exciting  conclusion  that  the  CH4  and  N2  partial  pressures  above  a 
mixture of CH4 saturated in N2-rich ice plus N2 saturated in CH4 ice is independent of the bulk 
N2:CH4 ice ratio, but these have not been tested under laboratory conditions. Moreover, as seen 
in the compilation by Fray and Schmitt (2009), laboratory measurements for the pure ices only 
exist  for  temperatures  above  54.78  K  for  CO  and  above  48.15  K  for  CH4;  and  the  only 
laboratory data below 35.4 K for N2 were published in 1960 (Borovik et al. 1960).

small bodies, because gravity decreases with altitude. 

For small column densities, the atmosphere can be described as a surface-bounded exobase, 
since if N0 σeff << 1, where σeff is the effective collision cross section, then an escaping molecule 
is not likely to suffer a collision on its way out. This condition is equivalent to a large Knudsen 
number,  Kn,  the  ratio  of  the  mean  free  path  between  collisions,  lmfp  =  1/(n0  σeff),  to  the  a 
characteristic  length  scale.  The  scale  in  question  depends  on  the  problem  at  hand;  taking  the 
scale height for the length scale (Zhu et al. 2014), Kn = 1 is one classic definition of an exobase.

σeff is  2 times larger than the collisional cross section, σcoll (Johnson et al. 2015).  Since σcoll ≈ 
0.46x10-14  for  CH4  (Atkins  and  de  Paula  2009)  or  σcoll  ≈    0.43x10-14  for  N2  (Kaye  and  Laby 
1973),  with  some  dependence  on  temperature,  atmospheres  with  N0  greater  than  ~  1.6  x  1014 
molecule cm-2 can be considered collisional. This is achieved for N2 or CH4 at extremely small 
surface pressures (Fig 1), e.g., ~3x10-8 µbar  for CH4 on a ρ=1.6 g cm-3, 100 km radius body, or  
~8x10-7  µbar  for  N2  on  a  ρ  =2.5  g  cm-3,  1000  km  radius  body.  Extrapolating  to  these  small 
pressures from the pressures measured in the lab is questionable, but application of the Fray and 
Schmidt  compilations  predicts  that  the  transition  to  continuum  atmospheres  happens  near 
temperatures  of  ~29  K  for  CH4,  and  ~21  K  for  N2,  depending  weakly  on  the  TNO  radius  and 
density.  For  larger  column  densities,  the  atmosphere  becomes  opaque  to  UV  radiation.  This 
transition occurs for Ly-α at N0 ~1018 molecule cm-2 (T0 ~ 26 K) for N2 with 3% CH4 gaseous 
molar mixing ratio, or N0 ~3x1016 molecule cm-2 (T0 ~ 32 K) for pure CH4 (Johnson et al. 2015). 
The  Jeans  parameter  at  the  surface,  or  ratio  of  potential  energy  to  thermal  energy,  is  a 

measure of how tightly bound the atmosphere is, and is given by:

The  Jeans  parameter  at  the  surface,  λ0,  varies  from  ~0.1  (unbound)  for  CH4  gas  on  100-km 
radius objects at 70 K to ~100 (bound) for N2 gas on 1000-km radius objects at 20 K. Although 
the composition surely varies from object to object, assuming each TNO has N2 on its surface it 
can be seen from Fig. 2 that due to the large range of temperatures, the TNO atmospheres can 
have  a  large  range  of  λ0  and  N0,  with  implications  for  atmospheric  escape,  seasonal  variation, 
and detectability.

4. Expected volatile retention 

In general, only the largest TNOs have had volatiles detected or suspected on their surfaces 
(Table  1).  This  is  not  merely  an  observational  effect  (i.e.,  because  higher  quality  spectra  are 
more  easily  obtained  on  larger  TNOs),  but  is  linked  to  the  escape  of  their  initial  inventory  of 
volatiles  (Schaller  &  Brown  2007a;  Levi  and  Podolak  2009;  Johnson  et  al.  2015).  Volatile 
escape  can  be  driven  by  heating  of  the  surface  by  solar  visible  radiation  and  by  absorption  of 
solar  radiation  in  the  atmosphere.  The  relative  importance  of  these  processes  depends  on  how 
tightly  bound  the  atmosphere  is,  parameterized  by  the  surface  Jeans  parameter  λ0,  and  its  UV 
opacity, parameterized by its surface column density, N0. Since the work of Schaller & Brown 
(2007a)  and  Levi  and  Podolak  (2009)  there  has  been  progress  in  estimating  the  escape  rate  in 
the  transition  to  the  fluid  regime  for  transparent  atmospheres  (Volkov  et  al.  2011a,b),  and  the 
role  of  atmospheric  heating  on  escape  (Johnson  et  al  2013a,b,  2015),  as  well  as  new 
observations relating to initial volatile inventories (Glein & Waite 2018) and the complexity of 
escape at Pluto (Gladstone & Young 2019). 

In order to provide a link between the presence of volatiles, the bulk properties, and the orbits 
of  TNOs,  Schaller  &  Brown  (2007a)  considered  sublimation-induced  escape  directly  from  the 
TNO  surface,  and  updated  this  work  in  Brown  et  al.  (2011).  Starting  with  the  equilibrium 
surface  temperature  (e.g.,  Eq.  1  with  𝜇 =   1/4  and η  =  1),  they  used  the  Jeans  expression  for 
escape  from  an  exobase,  evaluated  at  the  conditions  of  the  surface  (subscripted  here  as  SJ  for 
surface-Jeans): 

(5) 

 Φ!" = 4𝜋𝑟!

!𝑛! 𝑣/4 (1 + 𝜆!)exp  (−𝜆!) 

where Φ is the total  escape  rate  of  volatiles in molecule s-1, and 𝑣 =    8𝑘𝑇/𝜋𝑚  is the mean 
molecular speed. Using these expression for  T0 and Φ,  they divided the TNOs into those that 
would likely keep their volatiles and those that likely lost their initial volatile inventory over the 
age of the solar system (Fig 3).

The  surface-Jeans  estimate  of  the  escape  rate  is  roughly  accurate  if  the  atmosphere  is  non-
collisional, N0 < ~1014 molecule cm-2 (Fig 4), which holds for very distant TNOs. However, Eq. 
5 is problematic, even for atmospheres that are transparent to solar heating. Levi and Podolak 
(2009) subsequently used a hydrodynamics model that transitioned to Jeans escape. Volkov et 
al.  (2011a,  b)  used  a  molecular  kinetic  model,  the  Direct  Simulation  Monte  Carlo  (DSMC) 
method  (Bird  1994),  to  calculate  the  surface-heated  escape  rate,  ΦS,  from  a  single-component 
atmosphere  for  a  range  of  surface  values  of  T0  and  N0,  and  then  expanded  this  range  to  very 
thick  atmospheres  by  coupling  iteratively  to  a  fluid  model  in  (Johnson  et  al.  2015),  thereby 
covering the full range of escape due to surface heating. Note that Volkov et al. (2011a, b) use 
the  radial  Knudsen  number,  scaling  the  mean-free-path  by  the  surface  radius,  which  is 
appropriate for small bodies with extended atmospheres (i.e., small λ0). We denote that here as

For  cold  atmospheres  and  large  bodies  (high  gravity),  the  escape  rate  driven  only  by  the 
surface temperature is throttled for a bound atmosphere by the exp(-λ0) term in Eq. (5), (Fig 4). 
This can be overcome by direct absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere. Assuming ~2-
3%  CH4  in  the  more  volatile  N2  background  gas,  Johnson  et  al.  (2015)  calculated  that  the 
column of gas that is sufficient for the UV and EUV to be primarily absorbed in the atmosphere 
is N0 > NC, where NC ≈ 1018 molecule cm-2 is the minimum column for UV absorption. Prior to 
the New Horizons encounter, models of Pluto’s atmospheric loss coupled a fluid simulation to a 
DSMC molecular kinetic simulation (e.g., Erwin et al. 2013; Tucker et al. 2012) to describe the 
UV/EUV  absorption  vs.  depth  as  well  as  the  escape  from  the  exobase  region.  In  their  Pluto 
modeling, the simulated loss rate was matched reasonably well by the simple so-called energy 
limited  escape  model,  in  which  the  gravitational  energy  lost  by  the  escaping  molecules  is  set 
equal to the heating produced by the absorbed UV radiation. The limits to the applicability of 
that  model  was  explored  in  Johnson  et  al.  (2013)  and  subsequently  applied  to  other  KBOs 
(Johnson  et  al.  2015).  Lyα  dominates  the  absorbed  UV  flux  if  CH4  is  optically  thick.  Since 
scattered  interplanetary  Lyα  and  stellar  flux  contribute  to  the  UV  flux  in  the  trans-Neptunian 
region,  the  energy-limited  flux  falls  off  more  slowly  than  R2.  Eq.  (7)  gives  the  expression 
adopted  by  Johnson  et  al.  (2015)  for  the  escape  due  to  UV/EUV  heating  in  the  upper 
atmosphere, ΦU, scaled to the detailed rate calculated for Pluto, ΦP : 

  (7) 

 Φ! = Φ! 𝜌! 𝜌

30 𝑅 ! + 0.09  

where ρP and ρ are is the density of Pluto and the TNO, R is the heliocentric distance in AU, and 
ΦP is the escape rate at Pluto due to the direct solar UV flux. The second term in the brackets 
accounts  for  so-called  interplanetary  UV  flux  (Gladstone  et  al.  1998)  ignored  in  those  papers, 
but which becomes important at very large R. Johnson et al. (2015), based on Erwin et al. 2013 
and Tucker et al. 2012, adopted ρP = 2.05 g cm-3, and ΦP = 120 kg s-1 / mN2 = 2.6x1027 N2 s-1. 
Johnson et al. (2015) combined surface and upper atmospheric heating by restricting ΦU to N0 > 
NC and choosing the larger of ΦS and ΦU (Fig 4). Fig. 4 only gives a rough guide for ranges in 
which global models of the two escape processes dominate. Johnson et al. (2015) integrated the 
combined atmospheric loss rates over the lifetime of individual TNOs (Table 2 in Johnson et al. 
2015, which did not include Orcus and Varuna). Besides Charon, which has likely lost its initial 
volatiles,  they  concluded  that  for  the  objects  studied  only  Makemake,  Quaoar  and  2007  OR10 
likely  lost  a  large  fraction  of  their  volatiles,  primarily  due  to  short  wavelength  absorption  in 
their  upper  atmospheres,  while  Pluto,  Triton,  and  Sedna  had  retained  most  of  theirs.  While 
similar  conclusions  were  reached  by  Schaller  &  Brown  (2007a),  the  fraction  of  volatiles 
retained by Pluto, Triton, and Sedna differed.

The  picture  created  by  these  simulations  has  been  altered  by  two  recent  spacecraft 
measurements. One is our more recent understanding of Pluto’s atmosphere based on the New 
Horizons observations (Gladstone and Young 2019). Prior to the flyby, the expected escape rate 

8 

 
 
was ~[0.4-4] x 1027 N2 s-1 (Zhu et al. 2014), consistent with energy-limited escape. The escape 
rate  that  is  derived  from  the  observed  density  and  temperature  profile  is  much  lower:  (3–7)  × 
1022 N2 s−1 and (4–8) × 1025 CH4 s−1 (Young et al 2018). Applying these new observations has 
been confounded by the fact that the principal cooling agent in Pluto’s upper atmosphere, which 
also compressed the extent of Pluto’s atmosphere, is still uncertain (Gladstone & Young 2019). 
Pluto’s current escape rate must be better understood before volatile loss can be calculated for 
Pluto at other epochs, or for other bodies. The second is new constraints on the initial inventory 
of volatiles. While Schaller & Brown 2007a and Johnson et al. 2015 used an N2 to H2O mass 
ratio  of  2%,  Glein  &  Waite  (2018)  use  the  mixing  ratio  of  N2  measured  in  the  coma  of  67P 
(Rubin et al., 2015) to derive an N2 to H2O mass ratio of only [0.7-6]x10-4.  

5. Variation of atmospheres over an orbit 

Because the sublimation pressures depend exponentially on the temperatures of the volatile 
ices, the gases surrounding volatile-bearing TNOs vary with heliocentric distance and subsolar 
latitude, and possibly time of day and latitude. This was initially modeled for Triton and Pluto 
(see  reviews  by  Spencer  et  al.  1997  and  Yelle  et  al.  1995).  Since  those  reviews,  trends  of 
increasing atmospheric pressure for both Triton and Pluto were observed using the technique of 
stellar occultation, with an increase by factors of two and three respectively (Elliot et al. 1998; 
Elliot et al. 2000; Elliot et al. 2003a; Olkin et al. 1997, 2015; Meza et al 2019; see section 6). 
The new time-base of atmospheric observations and the New Horizons flyby of Pluto inspired 
new models of seasonal variation (e.g., Young 2012, 2013, 2017; Hansen et al. 2015; Olkin et 
al.  2015),  including  general  circulation  models  (e.g.,  Forget  et  al.  2017)  and  evolution  of 
atmospheres on the timescale of millions of years (e.g., Bertrand et al. 2016, 2018). 

When N2 was discovered on the surface of Eris, authors speculated that volatiles on TNOs, 
especially N2, could raise temporary atmospheres near perihelion (e.g., Dumas et al. 2007). This 
was generalized in Stern and Trafton (2008), and applied numerically to the known or suspected 
volatile-bearing  TNOs  by  Young  &  McKinnon  (2013).  When  thinking  about  atmospheres  on 
TNOs,  it  is  useful  to  distinguish  three  types:  global,  collisional,  and  ballistic.  For  global 
sublimation-supported  atmospheres,  such  as  Mars  or  current-day  Pluto  and  Triton,  volatiles 
sublime  from  areas  of  higher  insolation,  and  recondense  on  areas  of  lower  insolation, 
transporting  latent  heat  as  well  as  mass  (Trafton  1984,  Ingersoll  1990;  also  see  reviews  by 
Spencer et al. 1997; Yelle et al. 1995; Stern and Trafton 2008). As long as the volatiles can be 
effectively  transported,  the  surface  pressures  and  the  volatile  ice  temperatures  will  be  nearly 
constant across the surface. Sublimation winds transport mass from latitudes of high insolation 
to low insolation. Trafton (1984) showed that pressures stay within 10% across the surface if the 
sublimation winds (v) are less than 7.2% of the sound speed (vs). The sublimation wind speeds 
can  by  found  by  conservation  of  mass:  the  mass  per  time  crossing  a  given  latitude  equals  the 
integral  of  the  net  deposition  from  that  latitude  to  the  pole.  The  wind  speeds  depend  on  the 
subsolar  latitude  (Trafton  1984),  if  we  consider  diurnally  averaged  insolation;  higher  wind 
speeds  are  needed  to  transport  volatiles  pole-to-pole  (high  subsolar  latitudes)  than  equator-to-
pole  (low  subsolar  latitudes).  For  an  “ice  ball”  uniformly  covered  in  volatiles,  the  maximum 
sublimation wind speed, v, can be expressed as

!   is  the  absorbed  normal  insolation,  and  L  is  the  latent 
heat  of  sublimation,  in  energy  per  mass.  𝜉  in  Eq.  8  is  a  numerical  factor  accounting  for  the 
subsolar  latitude,  𝜆!"#.  We  calculated  𝜉  numerically,  following  the  prescription  of  Young 
(1992). From these calculations, 𝜉 is well approximated by a cubic expression 

(9)      𝜉(𝜆!"#) ≈   0.044   +   0.148  (𝜆!"#/90°)    +   0.4012  (𝜆!"#/90°)!    −   0.296  (𝜆!"#/90°)! 

For a 400-1400 km radius body uniformly covered with CH4 ice to have a global atmosphere, 
the pressure needs to be greater than ~17 to 295 nbar for polar illumination (3.1x1019 to 1.6x1020 
cm-2, 41.0 to 45.6 K; Fig 5), or 1.9 to 33 nbar for equatorial illumination (3.6x1018 to 1.8x1019 
cm-2, 38.1 to 42.0 K). For N2, the pressures are similar, so the temperatures are lower: 14 to 244 
nbar for polar (1.5x1019 to 7.4x1019 cm-2, 29.1 to 31.9 K) or 2 to 28 nbar for equatorial (1.8x1018 
to  68.5x1018  cm-2,  27.2  to  29.7  K).  N0  increases  slightly  faster  than  r  because  both  S  and  N0 
increase  with  temperature;  p0  increases  even  faster,  slightly  faster  than  r2,  because  of  its 
dependence on g0 (Eq. 2).  

The  temperatures  in  Fig  5  are  highly  simplified. Seasonal  thermal  inertia  can  be  important, 
even at the long timescales in the outer solar system. More significantly, bodies are unlikely to 
be uniformly covered in volatiles. For example, much of the N2 on Pluto is located in the basin 
known as Sputnik Planitia (Moore et al. 2016), and Triton’s N2 may be perennially confined to 
the southern hemisphere (Moore & Spencer 1990).  

INSERT FIG. 5 HERE 

Non-global atmospheres will vary with location and time-of-day, but may still be collisional, 
if the column density is greater than ~1014 cm-2 for either N2 or CH4. Io is a classic example of a 
local  atmosphere  that  is  collisional  around  the  sub-solar  point,  and  demonstrates  some  of  the 
processes that are active in even these thin atmospheres. Atmospheric chemistry can occur even 
in  these  local,  tenuous  atmospheres  (Wong  &  Smyth  2000).  Supersonic  winds  certainly  flow 
and  transport  volatiles,  even  if  they  are  not  effective  at  equalizing  pressures  and  temperatures 
(e.g.,  Walker  et  al.  2012).  Recently,  Hofgartner  et  al.  (2018)  used  the  Ingersoll  et  al.  (1985) 
meteorological model developed for Io study the transport of N2 on Eris at aphelion, when it is a 
local, collisional atmosphere, and found significant transport of N2 ice. Even for more tenuous 
“surface-bounded  exospheres,”  the  loss  of  volatiles  can  modify  landforms  (see  review  by 
Mangold  2011).  For  example,  sublimation  erosion  may  lead  to  the  narrow  divides  between 
craters on Hyperion (Howard et al. 2012) or redeposition on the crater rims on Callisto, where 
the  convex  summits  see  less  of  the  warm  surface  than  do  concave  crater  interiors,  and  are 
therefore local cold traps (Howard and Moore 2008). 

6. Detections of or limits on atmospheres by stellar occultation.  

The  technique  of  stellar  occultation  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  ways  to  search  for 
atmospheres around these bodies. While infrared absorption or radio emission have detected low 
column  densities  of  CO  and  CH4  on  Triton  (Lellouch  et  al.  2010)  or  CO  and  HCN  on  Pluto 
(Lellouch et al. 2017), these are bright targets. Stellar occultations depend on the brightness of 
the occulted star, and also study the target’s size, shape, and the presence or nature of rings or 

10 

 
 
jets (see Ortiz et al. 2019, this volume; Elliot and Olkin 1996, Elliot & Kern 2003; Santos-Sanz 
et al 2016). In an occultation, the starlight is refracted through a bending angle that increases in 
magnitude  roughly  in  proportion  to  the  line-of-sight  column  density  (Nlos).  This  leads  to 
differential  refraction,  or  a  divergence  of  the  refracted  rays  (cf  Elliot  and  Olkin  1996),  which 
dims the occulted starlight according to the scale height H and the column density. Some insight 
can be gained (Fig. 6) from the approximate, analytic expression for the relative stellar flux, φ,  
(e.g., Elliot and Young 1992):

standard  temperature  and  pressure  (2.9x10-4  and  4.4x10-4  for  N2  and  CH4  at  0.7  µm),  nSTP  is 
Loschmidt’s constant (2.6868x1019 cm-3), and Δ is the target-observer distance. As before, r is 
the radius (distance from target center) and H is the atmospheric scale height. 𝑁!"# is the line-of-
sight column density (molecule per area), which is larger than N, the vertical column density, by 
the unitless factor  2𝜋𝜆 (e.g. 8-25 for λ≈10-100). 𝜎!"# is the extinction cross section (area per 
molecule).  The  first  term  represents  the  decrease  due  to  the  divergence  (defocusing)  of  rays 
perpendicular to the limb, and halves the starlight when 𝜃Δ ≈ −𝐻. The second term represents 
the increase due to refocusing parallel to the limb, leading to a “central flash” near the center of 
the shadow. The final term represents extinction, which becomes important when 𝑁!"# ≈ 1/𝜎!"# 
(e.g.,  Nlos  ≈  1026  molecule  cm-2  for  Rayleigh  scattering  at  visible  wavelengths,  or  Nlos  ≈  1017 
molecule cm-2 for typical crosssections in the extreme ultraviolet (UV)). Refraction is typically 
dominant over extinction for Earth-based stellar occultations of TNOs, and extinction dominates 
for spacecraft UV occultations.

Lightcurves  from  model  atmospheres  can  be  calculated  analytically  for  some  idealized 
atmospheres (e.g., isothermal or 𝑇 ∝ 𝑟!, 𝛽 ≪ 1, Elliot and Young 1992). However, the presence 
of CH4 or its by-products (including photochemical haze) can heat up the atmosphere by 10s of 
K  (Yelle  and  Lunine  1989,  Zhang  et  al.  2018).  For  more  complex  atmospheres,  synthetic 
lightcurves  are  calculated  under  the  assumption  of  geometric  optics/ray-tracing  (Sicardy  et  al. 
1999  and  references  therein)  or  wave  optics/Fresnel  diffraction  (French  and  Gierasch  1976). 
Standard model fitting can then be used to extract the geometric edge and the refractivity of the 
atmosphere  at  the  surface.  For  high  quality  data  (as  has  been  obtained  for  Pluto  and  Triton), 
lightcurves  can  be  inverted  to  extract  temperature,  pressure,  and  number-density  profiles  (e.g. 
Elliot et al. 2003b). Derived surface pressures (or upper limits) from occultation lightcurves can 
be compared to the sublimation pressures for the atmospheric molecules under consideration, as 
expected from its surface equilibrium temperature (Fray and Schmitt 2009).  

Synthetic light curves vs. shadow radius are plotted in Fig. 7 for an example TNO with an N2 
or  CH4-dominated  atmosphere  (see  caption  for  model  details). Very  thin  atmospheres  (10’s  to 
100’s of nanobar, or ~1019 to 1020 molecule cm–2) cause only a small drop of flux very close to 
the surface, requiring very high signal to noise ratio for detection.  Denser atmospheres (a few 
µbar, or ~1020 molecule cm–2) cause a gradual drop in the star flux at a significant distance from 

Trans-Neptunian Solar System book

the object's surface, so they will be easier to detect. For denser atmospheres, the ray that grazes 
the TNO surface is refracted inward significantly towards smaller shadow radii (bent by 94 to 
112 km for 1 µbar CH4 or N2 atmospheres). For the 10 µbar curve in Fig. 7, the surface-grazing 
ray  is  refracted  past  the  shadow  center.  The  bottom  flux  never  reaches  zero  and  much  of  the 
lightcurve  is  the  sum  of  the  near  and  far  limb  contributions.  In  the  example  plotted, the  limb-
grazing  ray  is  bent  by  900  to  1180  km  for  a  CH4  or  N2  atmospheres,  leading  to  the 
discontinuities  seen  at  ±400  km  or  ±680  km  for  the  CH4-or  the  N2-dominated  atmospheres. 
When the star crosses the center of the object as seen from Earth, it causes a prominent central 
flash for the 10 microbar atmosphere, as the atmosphere acts as a lens, converging the starlight 
from all parts of the atmosphere to the observer.

Stellar occultations by Pluto, Charon, and Triton, have been observed since the 1980’s.  
Pluto:  A  single-chord  occultation  from  1985  was  observed  under  extremely  difficult 
circumstances  (Brosch  1995).  The  definitive  discovery  of  Pluto’s  atmosphere  was  from  the 
1988 stellar occultation (Hubbard et al. 1988, Millis et al. 1993). Observations in 2002 showed a 
doubling of the pressure since 1988 (Sicardy et al 2003; Elliot et al. 2003a). Many high-quality 
observations  since  have  revealed  the  continued  changes  in  Pluto’s  atmosphere,  its  thermal 
structure, and waves (Young et al. 2008; Toigo et al. 2010; Sicardy et al. 2016; Dias-Oliveira et 
al.    2015;  Pasachoff  et  al.  2017;  Meza  et  al.  2019).  The  New  Horizons  radio  and  solar 
occultations revealed N2 in vapor-pressure equilibrium with the N2-rich ice, an overabundance 
of  gaseous  CH4  possibly  explained  by  CH4-rich  patches,  hazes  and  photochemical  products,  a 
cold  upper  atmosphere,  and  an  atmospheric  escape  rate  dominated  by  CH4  and  much  smaller 
than expected (See Spencer et al. 2019, this book, and Gladstone & Young 2019).    

Triton:  Triton,  like  Pluto,  was  visited  by  a  spacecraft,  and  has  had  several  high-quality 
occultations, notably the 1997-Nov-4 Triton occultation observed from HST (Elliot et al. 1998). 
Occultations in the 1990’s show a doubling of surface pressure on decadal timescales compared 
to  the  1989  flyby  by  Voyager  2  (Elliot  et  al.  1998;  Elliot  et  al.  2000;  Young  et  al.  2002).  An 
occultation  from  2017  suggests  that  the  increase  has  peaked  (Marques  Oliveira  et  al.  2018; 
Person et al. 2018). 

Charon: Prior to the New Horizons flyby, limits on Charon’s atmosphere were set to be < 50 
nbar (1-σ) from stellar occultation (Gulbis et al. 2006), and the New Horizons UV occultation 
set limits of < 1.4 pbar (Stern et al. 2017). 

Since  2009,  stellar  occultations  have  been  successfully  used  to  study  other  TNOs,  and  the 
search  for  an  atmospheric  signature  was  carried  for  a  few  of  them.  Most  of  the  largest  bodies 
have already observed during a stellar occultation event and no atmosphere around a TNO has 
been  found  so  far  (other  than  Pluto  and  ex-TNO  Triton).  Upper  limits  on  the  presence  of 
putative atmospheres were obtained and they are summarized below and in Table 2. 

Eris:  A  stellar  occultation  of  a  V  =  17.1  star  by  Eris  was  observed  on  November  06,  2010 
(Sicardy  et  al.  2011).  Eris,  the  second  biggest  TNO  after  Pluto,  was  at  95.7  AU  and  had  a 
surface  temperature  estimated  at  30  K.    With  methane  and  nitrogen  detected  on  its  surface,  it 
was  a  good  candidate  to  have  retained  volatiles.  The  occultation  allowed  a  constraint  on  the 
presence of an isothermal N2 atmosphere to an upper limit of 1 nbar at the surface, with similar 
limits for CH4 and argon. The occultation revealed that Eris is one of the brightest objects of the 
solar  system,  with  a  geometrical  albedo  of  pv=  0.96  (+0.09/-0.04),  which  may  be  caused  by  a 

12 

 
 
collapsed atmosphere, as discussed above. As the sub-solar temperature of Eris can reach 35 K, 
the authors mentioned that a local sub-solar atmosphere of N2 may exist, but it would freeze to 
undetectable values at the limb. It is suggested that, due to the eccentric orbit of Eris, when it 
approaches its perihelion at 37.8 AU, it may develop a global atmosphere of 2 µbar.   

Haumea:  An  observation  of  a  stellar  occultation  by  Haumea  on  the  February  21,  2017 
revealed that it also possesses a dense ring of 70 km in width (Ortiz et al., 2017), making it as 
the second small solar system object, after (10199) Chariklo (Braga-Ribas et al., 2014a), known 
to have a ring. Upper limits (1-σ) were obtained for the atmosphere of Psurf < 10 nbar (CH4) or 
Psurf    <  3  nbar  (N2).  This  is  consistent  with  the  lack  of  spectral  evidence  of  CH4  or  N2  on 
Haumea’s surface. Haumea’s ring, two moons, and the Haumea dynamical family suggest that 
volatiles were lost via a disruptive collision (e.g., Schaller & Brown 2007a). 

Makemake: A Makemake occultation of a V = 18.5 star on April 23, 2011 was detected from 
seven telescopes in Chile (Ortiz et al., 2012). The preferred solution for the projected shape is an 
ellipsoid with axes of 1430±9 km and 1502±45 km. Constraining the shape to a circular cross 
section gives a radius of 1430±9 km, and is also consistent with the observations. The preferred 
(elliptical) solution gives a geometric albedo at V of pV = 0.77±0.03. This is a bright albedo, and 
is  consistent  with  surface  freshening  by  a  periodic  atmosphere.  No  global  atmosphere  was 
detected, with limits on a global atmosphere of < 12 nbar (1-σ). This is somewhat surprising, as 
Makemake was a candidate for a global atmosphere, especially given the report of N2 ice from 
CH4 band shifts. The conclusion is that Makemake has lost almost all of its N2 gas, or that the 
atmosphere near the limb has frozen to undetectable values (e.g. for a pole-on orientation or a 
slow  rotation/low  thermal  inertia).  Ortiz  et  al.  (2012)  also  modeled  the  effect  of  a  local 
atmosphere on the occultation light curves, motivated by some points close to centrality with an 
elevated flux a few σ above the noise, and placed loose limits on a local atmosphere of Psurf <30 
µbar.  

Quaoar:  A  large  TNO  (r0  =  550  km)  with  CH4  reported  on  its  surface,  Quaoar  was  a 
candidate  to  possess  a  thin  atmosphere.  It  was  observed  crossing  in  front  of  a  star  on  May  4, 
2011, from which upper limits on the presence of an atmosphere were derived (Braga-Ribas et 
al.,  2013).  Being  at  a  distance  of  42.4  AU,  with  a  geometric  albedo  of  0.109,  a  surface 
equilibrium temperature of 40 K is expected. Considering a CH4 dominant atmosphere, reaching 
102 K above 10 km from the surface, an upper limit of Psurf < 21 nbar (1-σ) was obtained. As N2 
would have a vapor pressure of 66-176 microbar at 40-42 K, the data rule out this scenario.

Smaller TNOS: Additional TNOs have been observed during stellar occultations, and no clear 
signals of any atmosphere were detected. For these events, there are no published upper limits, 
because the decrease in stellar flux was abrupt (rather than dimming by atmospheric refraction), 
and  the  data  did  not  have  high  enough  quality  (cadence  or  signal-to-noise  ratio)  for  any 
constraints  on  a  thin  atmosphere.  The  larger  bodies  (equivalent  radii  r0  >  200  km)  so  probed 
include: Varuna (r0 = 568 km; Sicardy et al. 2010), 2003 VS2 (r0 = 274 km; Benedetti-Rossi et 
al.  2019),  2002  TC302  (r0  =  499  km;  Santos-Sanz  et  al.  2017),  2003  AZ84  (r0  =  382  km;  Dias-
Oliveira et al. 2017) and 2007 UK126 (319 km; Benedetti-Rossi et al. 2016).

7. Future research  

The above discussion suggests some critical directions for future research. 
Surface Compositions:  

●  The spectra of Pluto and Triton changes on the timescale of decades, and is related to 
both changing viewing geometry and possibly real changes in the volatile distribution 
or physical state of volatile ices (e.g., grain size). The changing compositions of Triton 
(visual magnitude  V=13.4) and Pluto  (V=14.2) can and should  continue  to  be  tracked 
with moderate ground-based telescopes, to decouple these effects. 

●  For other large TNOs, new understanding of the surface stratification of CH4 and N2 on 
Eris (V=18.7) needs higher spectral resolution and SNR than previous spectra, as does 
the confirmation of, or constraints on, CH4 on Quaoar (V=18.7), 2007 OR10 (V=21.3), 
Sedna  (V=20.8),  Varuna  (V=20.1),  and  Orcus  (V=19.2).  Some  progress  is  likely  to 
come from the new generation of infrared detectors (e.g., NIRES on Keck, or NIHTS 
on  DCT).  JWST’s  spectral  sensitivity  from  1-5  microns  will  be  very  powerful  for 
measuring  the  volatiles  and  other  species  on  the  surfaces  of  these  and  other  TNOs 
(Parker  et  al.  2016).  Both  the  Thirty  Meter  Telescope  and  the  European  Extremely 
Large  Telescope  have  planned  near-infrared  integral  field  spectrometers  as  first  light 
instruments,  and  their  various  white  papers  emphasize  how  they  will  revolutionize 
TNO spectroscopy.  

Laboratory work:  

●  The vapor pressures of CO and CH4 should be measured at TNO temperatures of 20-40 
K,  and  the  vapor  pressure  of  N2  should  be  remeasured  in  a  modern  lab.  Also,  recent 
work on the vapor pressures of mixed volatile ices (Trafton 2015; Tan & Kargle 2018) 
should be tested under laboratory conditions. 

●  Measurements of the spectrum of CH4 ice in the visible, both pure and in solution with 
N2, is needed for quantitative analysis of Makemake’s CH4 features 0.54-0.62 µm. 

Atmospheric retention and escape:  

●  The most critical work is a better model of why the escape rate at Pluto in 2015 (~5 × 
1022  N2  s−1  and  ~6  ×  1025  CH4  s−1)  is  so  much  lower  than  the  energy-limited  rate 
expected pre-encounter (~2 × 1027 N2 s−1), and how that model can be applied to Pluto 
at other seasons, and to other TNOs. 

●  Current  DSMC  work  on  volatile  retention  only  models  a  single  species,  but  the 
observed mixed surfaces with both N2 and CH4 suggest new DSMC work with multiple 
species.  Similarly,  local  atmospheres  (e.g.,  dome-like  atmospheres  over  the  subsolar 
point) can be more completely modeled. 

Seasonal transport:  

●  Models  such  as  Hofgartner  et  al.  (2018)  can  be  used  to  investigate  the  transition 

between global and collisional atmospheres. 

Atmospheric searches:  

●  Higher  SNR  occultations  with  higher  cadence  can  help  the  sensitivity,  and  can  help 
break  ambiguity  in  the  cases  of  suspected  local  atmospheres.  Accurate  star  positions 
are  now  given  by  the  Gaia  catalogue,  but  ephemeris  errors  are  nearly  always  much 
greater than the object's apparent angular size. Astrometric positions are needed for the 
targeted TNOs. One source of positions can be the big and deep surveys like the Large 
Synoptic  Sky  Survey  that  is  expected  to  begin  observations  in  2022,  and  will  help  to 

14 

update TNOs ephemerides and so improve stellar occultation predictions (Camargo et 
al. 2018).

Fig. 1. Sublimation pressure (left axis) for N2, CO, and CH4 (Fray & Schmitt 2009; FS09). The column density (right 
axis) is calculated for a body with bulk density ρ of 1.9 g cm-3 and a surface radius r0 of 500 km for N2 or CO (µ = 28) 
For a given pressure, the column density scales as 1/(µ ρ r0).  Thus, the plotted column density (right axis) also applies 
for ρ = 1.9 g cm-3 and a surface radius r0 of 875 km for CH4 (µ = 16). Thick lines show the ranges of temperatures at or 
below 60 K from laboratory measurements included in FS09: for N2, 21.20-26.40 K (Borovik et al. 1960), 35.40-59.17 
K (Frels et al. 1974), and 54.78–61.70 K (Giauque & Clayton 1933); for CO, 54.78–68.07 (Shinoda 1969); and for CH4, 
48.15–77.65 K (Tickner & Lossing 1951) and 53.15–90.66 K (Armstrong et al. 1955). The α-β phase transition for N2 is 
indicated (35.61 K). The dot-dashed line indicates the rough transition between ballistic and collisional atmospheres, for 
ρ = 1.9 g cm-3 and r0= 500 km.

Fig. 2. Range of surface Jeans parameter, λ0, vs. total column density, N0, over the orbits of a number of TNOs assuming 
an N2 atmosphere (Johnson et al. 2015) using ε = 0.8 and A=0.67, appropriate for an early TNO with a bright surface. 
For  Makemake,  2007  OR10,  and  Sedna  we  used  ρ  =  1.8  g  cm-3.  Sednaʼs  values  are  shown  only  near  perihelion  as  its 
aphelion  (N0  <<  1014  cm−2)  is  off-scale.  Dashed  line:  N0  =  1018  N2  cm-2;  to  the  right  the  CH4  and  N2  components  are 
sufficient  so  that  escape  is  mainly  driven  by  solar  heating  of  the  atmosphere.  Dotted–dashed  line:  surface-heating-
induced escape rate is smaller than Jeans formula below this line (warmer surface or lower surface gravity) and greater 
above this line. From Johnson et al. 2015. Reproduced by permission of the AAS.

Solid red: Lines of constant column density at the surface for two critical values: for N0 = 1014 cm-3 defining the classical 
surface-bounded  exobase,  and  N0  =  1018  cm-3  for  an  N2  atmosphere  with  3%  CH4  to  be  opaque  to  Ly-α.  Dashed  red: 
Lines  of  constant  Jeans  parameter  for  two  critical  values  dividing  the  unbound  and  bound  atmosphere  (Volkov  et  al. 
2011b). Hashed red: Atmospheric heating dominates the loss rate in the shaded region (adopted from the shaded regions 
in  Fig  3  of  Johnson  et  al.  2015)  for A  =  0.1  (single  hash)  and  A  =  0.67  (cross-hatched).  Outside  the  hashed  area,  the 
surface-heated  escape  rate  for  warm,  small  bodies  is  much  smaller  than  the  surface-Jeans  estimate,  but  the  surface-
heated escape rate for cold, large bodies is slightly larger than the surface-Jeans estimate (cf. dot-dashed line in Fig 1).

Figure 5. In a global atmosphere, pressures are high enough so that the sublimation winds can keep surface pressures 
and volatile ice temperatures nearly uniform over the globe. Minimum temperatures for a global atmosphere are plotted, 
assuming a surface uniformly covered with CH4 ice (blue) or N2 ice (red), for two extreme sub-solar latitudes. Several 
bodies would have global atmospheres at some portion of their orbit if covered with N2 ice (as reported on Triton, Pluto, 
Eris,  Makemake,  and  possibly  Quaoar).  A  much  smaller  number  of  bodies  would  have  global  atmospheres  at  some 
portion  of  their  orbit  if  covered  with  only  CH4  ice  (as  reported  possibly  on  Varuna,  Orcus,  Quaoar,  Sedna,  and  2007 
OR10). Thermal inertia and non-uniform volatile ice coverage can change the range of temperatures actually achieved. 
Temperatures and diameters are as in Fig. 4.

Figure  6.  Detectability  of  TNO  atmospheres  by  ground-based  stellar  occultation,  under  the  assumption  that  the 
atmosphere is isothermal, and both atmosphere and surface are at the plotted temperature. The blue (CH4) and red (N2) 
detectability limits are for 50% or 10% drop in stellar flux for a surface-grazing ray. Near 35 K for N2 and 50 K for CH4, 
the surface-grazing ray causes a central flash (Eq 10, second term), which leads to a discontinuity in the derived limits; 
the plotted limits are somewhat conservative near this discontinuity. Temperatures and diameters are as in Fig. 4.
