ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to show that large active regions (ARs) with diﬀer-
ent magnetic conﬁgurations have diﬀerent contributions to short-term and long-term
variations of the Sun. As a case study, the complex δ-type AR 12673 and the simple
β-type AR 12674 are investigated in detail. Since the axial dipole moment at cycle
minimum determines the amplitude of the subsequent cycle and space climate, we
have assimilated the individual observed magnetic conﬁgurations of these two ARs
into a surface ﬂux transport model to compare their contributions to the axial dipole
moment D. We ﬁnd that AR 12673 has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on D at the end of the
cycle, making it weaker because of the abnormal and complicated magnetic polarities.
An initial strongly positive D ends up with a strongly negative value. The ﬂare-poor
AR 12674 has a greater contribution to the long-term axial dipole moment than the
ﬂare-rich AR 12673. We then carry out a statistical analysis of ARs larger than 800
µHem from 1976 to 2017. We use the ﬂare index FI and deﬁne an axial dipole mo-
ment index DI to quantify the eﬀects of each AR on space weather and space climate,
respectively. Whereas the FI has a strong dependence on the magnetic conﬁguration,
the DI shows no such dependence. The DI is mainly determined by the latitudinal
location and the latitudinal separation of the positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes
of the ARs. Simple ARs have the same possibility as complex ARs to produce big DI
values aﬀecting space climate.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Sun’s magnetic activity varies over diﬀerent time scales. Short-term variations
in diﬀerent forms of solar activity, e.g., solar ﬂare and coronal mass ejection, and their
eﬀects on the near-Earth environment and technology are usually referred to as space
weather. Long-term variations, e.g., those longer than years, in solar activity and their
eﬀects are usually referred to as space climate (Mursula et al. 2007; Nandy & Martens
2007).

Solar ﬂares are one of the main sources of disastrous space weather events. They
are thought to be caused by the release of magnetic energy (see Chen et al. 2011;
Shibata & Magara 2011, and references therein). It has been known for half a cen-
tury that active regions (ARs) with more complex magnetic conﬁgurations and larger
areas tend to produce ﬂares of greater magnitudes (K¨unzel 1960; Zirin & Liggett 1987;
Sammis et al. 2000). The Mount Wilson classiﬁcation system for sunspot groups is
widely used to describe the magnetic complexity of ARs. The system consists of
four parameters in ascending order of the magnetic complexity, i.e., α (unipolar), β
(bipolar), γ (multipolar), and δ. The parameter δ is assigned to complex regions
where at least one sunspot in the region contains opposite magnetic polarities inside
of a common penumbra separated by no more than 2◦ in heliographic distance. Al-
though the δ-type ARs are approximately 5% of all ARs (Jaeggli & Norton 2016),
diﬀerent statistical samples show that more than 80% of X-class ﬂares are from ARs
exhibiting δ sunspots (e.g., Zirin & Liggett 1987; Shi & Wang 1994; Guo et al. 2014;
Toriumi et al. 2017). The properties of δ-type ARs that host ﬂaring activity have
been investigated extensively in previous studies (e.g., Liu & Zhang 2002; Jing et al.
2006; Yang et al. 2017b).

However, as suggested by Chen & Wang (2012), in each solar cycle there are some
ARs that have very large areas (e.g., ≥ 1000 µHem, i.e., millionths of the solar
hemisphere), but do not produce any ﬂares higher than the M1.0 class. Only about
20% of all regions having area greater than 1000 µHem produce ﬂares over X1 class
(Sammis et al. 2000). Flare-poor, big ARs usually belong to the simple β type and
are ignored by the space weather community. The big AR 12674, which appeared on
the solar disk in 2017 September, is a typical example in this regard. It is a regular
β-type AR. The largest ﬂare produced by AR 12674 is C5.2. By contrast, the quasi-
simultaneous emergence of AR 12673 is a regular βγδ-type AR. It produced 27 M-class
and 4 X-class ﬂares, one of which is the largest one (X9.3) in solar cycle 24. To date,
there are several publications that have studied the ﬂare-productive AR 12673 (e.g.,
Yang et al. 2017a; Yan et al. 2018; Seaton & Darnel 2018; Shen et al. 2018). To our
knowledge, there have been no such studies on the ﬂare-quiet AR 12674. Actually,
these two big ARs, 12673 and 12674, have the same potential to aﬀect the solar cycle
evolution, and hence to impose a similar inﬂuence on space climate.

Within the Babcock-Leighton (BL) framework for solar dynamos (Babcock 1961;
Leighton 1969), the large-scale radial ﬁeld over the solar surface, especially the polar

ﬁeld or the axial dipole moment, is source of the toroidal ﬁeld responsible for solar
magnetic activity in the subsequent cycle. (Jiang et al. 2013; Cameron & Sch¨ussler
2015). After tilted bipolar or multipolar magnetic regions emerge on the solar surface,
they have an initial axial dipole moment determined by their area and tilt angle. Flux
transport processes over the surface have diﬀerent eﬀects on the axial dipole moment
depending on the latitudes of the ARs’ emergence. A lower latitude emergence gen-
erates a higher ﬁnal axial dipole moment, due to the larger amount of cross-equator
ﬂux. Jiang et al. (2014a) demonstrated that the latitudinal dependence of the ﬁ-
nal axial dipole moment obeys a Gaussian function; see also Wang & Sheeley (1991)
and Whitbread et al. (2018). Since the total ﬂux over the polar region is roughly
equivalent to the ﬂux of a large AR, the large ARs with high tilt angles and nor-
mal (abnormal) polarities emerging at low latitudes would have signiﬁcant positive
(negative) contributions to the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum and hence to
the subsequent solar cycle. Here, normal (abnormal) polarities of ARs denote Hale
ARs with their leading pole located equatorward (poleward) of their trailing pole and
the anti-Hale ARs with their leading pole located poleward (equatorward) of their
trailing pole. Evidences for the signiﬁcant eﬀect of a single special AR on the solar
cycle are as follows.

Wang & Sheeley (1991) and Whitbread et al. (2018) found that about half of the
axial dipole moment at cycle minimum comes from about 10% of ARs. Jiang et al.
(2015) identiﬁed that the deep cycle 23 minimum and the weak cycle 24 are caused
by a small number of large and abnormally oriented ARs. Nagy et al. (2017) demon-
strated that large ‘rogue’ regions can drastically aﬀect the evolution of future solar
cycles. Such large regions emerging during the early phases of a cycle can even aﬀect
the amplitude and duration of the same cycle. The eﬀect of a single AR emerging in
later phases can persist for multiple cycles. All of these studies indicated that large
individual active regions with atypical properties can have a signiﬁcant impact on
the long-term behavior of the solar cycle. Studies have shown that diﬀerent forms of
solar activity, e.g., ﬂare and CME occurrence rate and interplanetary shocks, track
the solar cycle in both amplitude and phase (Gopalswamy et al. 2004; Gopalswamy
2006; Kilpua et al. 2015). The long-term variation of solar activity corresponds to
space climate. Throughout the paper, we simplify our concept as follows: the short-
term variation of solar activity due to ﬂares is regarded as the eﬀects of ARs on
space weather, and the long-term variation of solar activity produced by variation
of the axial dipole moment in the time scale of solar cycle is regarded as the eﬀects
of ARs on space climate. Unlike the eﬀects of ARs on space weather, which depend
on the magnetic complexity and amount of ﬂux of ARs, the eﬀects of ARs on space
climate depend on the latitudinal location and initial latitudinal separation of ARs.
Therefore, ﬂare-poor big ARs with simple magnetic conﬁgurations could also have sig-
niﬁcant eﬀects on solar cycle variation and hence on space climate. This paper aims

to provide a systematic demonstration of the diﬀerent contributions from diﬀerent
types of big ARs to space weather and space climate.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we investigate the diﬀerent
contributions to space weather and especially to space climate from the big ARs 12673
and 12674 in detail. A statistical study of big ARs from 1976 to 2017 is presented in
Section 3. Finally, the summary and discussion are given in Section 4.

2. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO GREAT ACTIVE REGIONS: AR 12673

AND AR 12674

2.1. General information on the two ARs

The βγδ-type AR 12673 passed across the visible solar disk from 2017 August 28 to
2017 September 10. Based on the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) sunspot
catalogue 1, this sunspot reached a maximum area A of 1397 µHem on September 7th
with the latitudinal center λ at 9◦.36 of the southern hemisphere. The tilt angle, which
is measured based on the white-light image by the DPD, shows a large variation. The
standard deviation of its tilt angle σα is 43◦.16. This standard deviation is calculated
during the interval of August 31st to September 8th when its longitudinal distance
from the central meridian (LDCM) is less than 60◦. The average tilt α is 7◦. AR
12674 is a standard β-type AR that occurred on the visible solar disk one day after
AR 12673. Based on the DPD catalogue, its area A was 1238 µHem on September
3rd with the latitudinal center λ at 13◦.43 of the northern hemisphere. In contrast to
AR 12673, its tilt angle has small variations. The σα during September 1st to 9th,
when its LDCM was less than 60◦, is 2◦.87. The average tilt α is 22◦.2. The main
information on the two ARs is listed in Table 1.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data show that
AR 12673 produced 27 M-class and 4 X-class ﬂares (X9.3, X8.2, X2.2, and X1.3).
However, AR 12674 did not produce any ﬂares over the M1.0 class. The strongest ﬂare
produced by this AR is C5.2. The ﬂare index (F I) was ﬁrst introduced by Antalova
(1996) and was later widely applied by other authors to quantify the ﬂare productivity
of a given AR (e.g., Abramenko 2005; Romano & Zuccarello 2007; Chen et al. 2011).
We follow the traditional deﬁnition by weighting the soft X-ray ﬂares of classes C, M,
and X by 1, 10, and 100, respectively, regardless of the duration of the ﬂare. To be
more explicit, we provide it in the following format:

F I = X MC + 10 × X MM + 100 × X MX ,

(1)

where MC, MM , and MX are the magnitudes of all ﬂares belonging to the classes C,
M, and X, respectively. Flares smaller than the C1.0 class are not considered in the
deﬁnition. The F I values of ARs 12673 and 12674 are 2978.8 and 36.6, respectively.
The values clearly demonstrate that AR 12673 had stronger eﬀects on space weather
than AR 12674. In the following subsection, we compare their eﬀects on space climate
by investigating their contributions to the solar cycle variation.

2.3. Their eﬀects on space climate

Here we investigate diﬀerent contributions from diﬀerent ARs to the long-term
evolution of the polar ﬁeld and axial dipole moment, which reﬂect their eﬀects on
space climate. The upper panel of Figure 1 is the HMI/SDO Synoptic Chart of the
surface radial magnetic ﬁeld of Carrington Rotation (CR) 2195 (2017 September 12th
- October 10th). A calibration factor to MDI/SOHO of 1.3 is adopted here (Liu et al.
2012). ARs 12673 and 12674 reappeared around the central meridian on October 1st
and October 2nd, respectively, one CR later after their ﬁrst appearance on the solar
disk. They were denominated as ARs 12682 and 12683, respectively.

SFT simulations can reproduce well the observed large-scale solar surface ﬁeld (e.g.
Wang et al. 1989; Baumann et al. 2004; Jiang et al. 2010; Mackay & Yeates 2012;
Jiang et al. 2014b; Upton & Hathaway 2014). The emergent magnetic ﬂux corre-
sponding to the sunspot groups at the solar surface provides the source of the surface
ﬂux. The ﬂux is then transported and dispersed over the solar surface by systematic
ﬂows, including meridional ﬂow and diﬀerential rotation, and turbulent motions that
are eﬀectively treated as turbulent diﬀusion. These processes are modeled by the sur-
face ﬂux transport equation. The equation is the r-component of the MHD induction
equation at the solar surface under the assumption that the ﬁeld at the surface is
purely vertical.

Here we adopt the SFT model that has been used in our recent studies,

i.e.,
Jiang et al. (2015, 2018). All of the transport parameters are constrained from the
available observations. The only diﬀerence between the current model and previous
models (Jiang et al. 2015, 2018) is the strategy of incorporating the source term of
ﬂux emergence. In the past simulations, we used the analytical bipolar magnetic ﬂux
distributions for all the ARs or assimilated the full synoptic magnetograms as the ini-
tial condition in the solar cycle predictions (Cameron et al. 2016; Jiang & Cao 2018;
Jiang et al. 2018). Apparently, these methods are not realistic for isolating the contri-
bution from a complex multipolar conﬁgurations, like δ-type ARs. We assimilate each
observed AR that is isolated from the observed synoptic map into our SFT model fol-
lowing the idea of Yeates et al. (2015) and Whitbread et al. (2018), who have inserted
the observed shapes of individual ARs in their SFT simulations. The lower two panels
of Figure 1 are the isolated two ARs 12682 (12673) and 12683 (12674). The timing of
the magnetic ﬂux distribution assimilated into the SFT model is a major diﬀerence
from the assimilation technique by Yeates et al. (2015) and Whitbread et al. (2018).
They assimilated ARs into their simulations on the days of central meridian crossing.
Big ARs usually have not reached their area maximum on the day of the ﬁrst cen-
tral meridian crossing, and magnetic conﬁgurations usually change remarkably during
ﬂux emergence. So, we take the time around their second central meridian crossing
to start the simulations. This corresponds to ARs 12682 and 12683 on the CR2195
synoptic map. After the second central meridian crossing of an AR, there is usually
no further ﬂux emergence, and the conﬁguration becomes stable. This makes it a

reasonable time for the SFT simulation to obtain the contribution of the individual
AR to the axial dipole moment. Although a certain amount of ﬂux might have been
cancelled before the assimilation into the SFT simulation, it does not aﬀect its con-
tribution to the ﬁnal axial dipole moment, which corresponds to the large-scale and
slow-decay ﬁeld.

The major problem we encounter while assimilating the observed individual ARs
into the SFT model is the unbalanced magnetic ﬂux. The positive and negative ﬂuxes
for AR 12683 (12674) are 1.18×1022 Mx and -1.60×1022 Mx. We assume that some
positive ﬂux is too diﬀusive to get identiﬁed. Hence, we increase each positive pixel
by the same percentage as the diﬀerence between the two polarities, i.e., 35.6%. This
is another diﬀerence of our assimilation method from the assimilation method used
by Yeates et al. (2015). Then, we extrapolate the equal sine latitude distribution of
the HMI synoptic magnetogram to equal latitude. We used the IDL Congrid program
to reduce the size of the entire domain to 360 pixels in longitude and 180 pixels in
latitude, which is the resolution of our SFT simulations. After all these procedures,
the total ﬂux assimilated into the SFT model is 3.13×1022 Mx with balanced positive
and negative ﬂuxes. The positive and negative ﬂuxes for AR 12682 (12673) are
1.74×1022 Mx and -1.85×1022 Mx, respectively, with a slight imbalance. The same
procedure is followed to assimilate AR 12682 (12673). The ﬁnal total ﬂux assimilated
to the SFT simulation for AR 12682 (12673) is 3.50×1022 Mx.

We take the observed synoptic maps shown in the lower two panels of Figure 1

dial magnetic ﬁeld into spherical harmonics, originally developed by Baumann et al.
(2004). We take the maximum order of the spherical harmonics l = 64. The dis-
continuous discrete data from observations naturally bring spectral leakage. A Hann
window is used to reduce the side lobes (ripple) of the harmonics response. Figure
2 shows orthographic projections of AR 12682 (12673) and AR 12683 (12674) cen-
tered at the central meridian and the equator after using the spherical harmonics
decomposition of the isolated ARs presented in lower two panels of Figure 1. We
run each simulation for 10 years to make sure that the polar ﬁeld reaches a ﬁnal bal-
anced state (van Ballegooijen et al. 1998). Animations of the time evolution of the
two ARs starting from the time of data assimilation with a time interval of 27 days
are available.

Figure 3 shows the time evolution of the longitudinally averaged magnetic ﬁeld.
The upper panel is for the simple conﬁguration of AR 12674.
It shows a typical
evolution of an AR using SFT simulations presented in the previous studies (e.g.,
Wang et al. 2000; Mackay et al. 2002; Jiang et al. 2010; Yeates et al. 2015). As AR
12674 is bipolar, part of the leading negative polarity diﬀuses across the equator.
Under the eﬀects of the poleward meridional ﬂow and the turbulent diﬀusion, the
negative ﬂux that crossed the equator is ﬁnally transported to the southern pole.
The corresponding positive ﬂux is transported to the northern pole. Finally, a north-
south balanced polar ﬁeld sets up after about 6 years. Equations (4) and (5) of
Jiang & Cao (2018) are used to calculate the polar ﬁeld Bp(t) that is averaged over

the ±75◦ to ±60◦ latitudes in each hemisphere and the axial dipole moment D(t),
respectively. The black curves in Figure 4 show the time evolution of Bp and D.
The arrival of the following positive polarity increases the northern polar ﬁeld. The
arrival of the leading negative polarity that cancels with the existing positive ﬂux
causes the later decrease of the northern polar ﬁeld. The negative leading ﬂux gets
transported to the southern pole and generates the negative polar ﬁeld there. The ﬁnal
balanced northern and southern polar ﬁelds becomes 0.08 and -0.08 G, respectively.
The whole process corresponds, ﬁrst, to an increase of the axial dipole moment due to
the separation of the two polarities and then to a decrease due to the ﬂux cancellation.
The ﬁnal axial dipole moment Df is 0.044 G. According to Figure 8 of Jiang et al.
(2018), the axial dipole moments generated by all ARs during cycles 21-23 are 8.2
G, 7.4 G, and 4.3 G, respectively. On average, the axial dipole moment generated
by all of the ARs during a cycle is 6.6 G. This means that about 150 ARs of such
kind, which correspond to less than 7% of all ARs are enough to be responsible for
the solar cycle evolution. To obtain this estimation, we have assumed that all ARs
have normal polarities.

polarities denoted as ‘1’ and ‘2’ emerge across the equator. The negative polarity
has a much stronger ﬂux, which produces the strong cross-equator negative ﬂux. The
positive ﬂux arrives at the polar region ﬁrst and hence generates a positive polar
ﬁeld. The negative polarity arrives at the polar region later. The negative polarity
ﬁrst cancels the positive ﬂux and then builds up the negative ﬂux in the northern
pole. The other bipolar polarities, denoted as ‘3’ and ‘4’ have stronger positive ﬂux.

The lower latitude negative ﬂux arrives at the southern pole ﬁrst and forms the
negative polar ﬁeld, and then it gets reversed by the stronger positive ﬂux. Hence,
we see the reversals of the polar ﬁeld indicated by the red curves in the left panel of
Figure 4. The ﬁnal balanced northern and southern polar ﬁelds are -0.06 and 0.06 G,
respectively. The resultant polarity it generates is opposite to that generated by AR
12674, making the polar ﬁeld weaker at cycle minimum. This indicates that the AR
12673 has abnormal polarity.

The axial dipole moment evolution of AR 12673 shows an interesting result, which
seems surprising and has not been reported before to our knowledge. Its initial axial
dipole moment D0 is positive, which is consistent with the cycle. However, the ﬁnal
axial dipole moment is opposite to the initial one. The value of D0 is proportional to
B sin λ cos λ. Hence, the ﬂux closer to the equator, e.g., the polarities denoted as ‘1’
and ‘2’ in Figure 3 has less contribution to D0 than the ﬂux from higher latitudes, e.g.,
the polarities denoted as ‘3’ and ‘4’. The polarities ‘3’ and ‘4’ dominate the positive
D0 value, but the ﬁnal axial dipole moment from the AR is determined by the cross-
equator ﬂux, which is dominated by the cross-equator polarity ‘2’. Most of its negative
ﬂux is transported to the northern pole. Eventually, a negative/positive polar ﬁeld is
built up in the northern/southern poles. This corresponds to a strongly negative axial
dipole moment. In short, it is the ﬂux transport and the initial magnetic conﬁguration
that cause the reversal of the axial dipole moment and signiﬁcantly weaken the axial
dipole moment at the end of cycle 24. This numerical experiment demonstrates the
importance of including the conﬁguration of the δ-type ARs into SFT models to study
their contributions to the large-scale ﬁeld. The widely adopted methods, which use
the tilt angle to simplify the initial conﬁguration, cannot get the reversal of the axial
dipole moment presented here.

Here, we only considered the long-term (or the ﬁnal) contribution to the polar ﬁeld
and the axial dipole moment from the individual ARs. The signiﬁcant transient
perturbations to the polar ﬁeld due to strong pairs of opposite plumes in both panels
of Figure 3 are not what we aim to address here because their eﬀects on the solar
cycle have not been clear until now.

The time evolution of the longitudinally averaged synoptic magnetograms observed
by SDO/HMI is shown in Figure 5. From the annotated ellipses, we can see the
following structures that are consistent with the simulated results. First, there is a
positive poleward plume followed by the relatively weaker negative plume produced by
AR 12674 in the northern hemisphere. Second, there is more than one-year persistence
of the negative ﬂux around the equator produced by the cross-equator emergence of
the negative ﬂux of AR 12673 and migration of the leading polarity of AR 12674
towards the southern pole. Third, there is a weak negative poleward plume followed
by the stronger positive poleward plume in the southern hemisphere produced by AR
12673. Please note that remnants of other ARs make the observed structures not
that clear.

Figure 5. Time evolution of the longitudinal averaged synoptic maps from SDO/HMI. The
three typical structures produced by ARs 12673 and 12674 are denoted by the overlying
ellipses.

We have shown that the big βγδ-type AR 12673 has strong eﬀects on both the
short-term and the long-term solar activity. Although the big β-type AR 12674 does
not generate strong space weather events, it has a large contribution to the dipole
moment at the end of the cycle, and hence on space climate. In the following section,
we perform a statistical study of big solar ARs to investigate their eﬀects on the
short-term and long-term variations of solar activity.

3. STATISTICAL STUDIES OF BIG SOLAR ACTIVE REGIONS

3.1. Data source

The DPD is the most detailed and user-friendly catalog at present (Baranyi et al.
2016). It provides the area and position data for each observable sunspot and sunspot
groups on a daily basis along with images of sunspot groups, full-disk scans, and mag-
netograms starting from 1974 to the present (Baranyi et al. 2001, 2013). The data are
stable over the available time period, and the calibration factor to the RGO dataset
is close to 1.0 (Gy˝ori et al. 2017). The tilt angle data of the sunspot groups are also
available from the DPD. The tilt angles of the sunspot groups are determined in a
similar way to the longest datasets of sunspot group tilt angles from Mount Wilson
Observatory and Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (Baranyi 2015). Baranyi (2015) in-
dicated that the tilt angle data do not contain any magnetic polarity information
on spots, but the available magnetograms are frequently taken into account while
grouping spots. Thus, the DPD tilt angles data based on estimated polarities are
close to the data where magnetic polarities are taken into account (e.g. Li & Ulrich
2012; Stenﬂo & Kosovichev 2012). Therefore, we have considered the area, position,
and tilt angle of each AR based on the DPD data set.

For each AR, its area varies when it passes across the solar disk. We designate its
area A as its maximum area when it is within 60◦ LDCM. The corresponding location
is designated as the AR’s location, including the latitude λ. The tilt angle of each AR
also varies during its passing across the solar disk. We take the averaged value of the

 
12

Jie Jiang et al.

tilts, α, when it is within 60◦ LDCM as the tilt angle of the AR. The corresponding
standard deviation of the tilt angle is σα.

The GOES X-ray data are available from 1975 September onwards2. So, we select
the ARs that are larger than 800 µHem from the beginning of 1976 to the end of
2017. The 567 ARs that satisfy this requirement are singled out as our samples. The
samples show that 30% of ARs with areas larger than 1000 µHem are able to produce
ﬂares over X1. We use Equation (1) to calculate each sample’s ﬂare index F I.

The polar ﬁeld at solar cycle minimum, which is the source of the toroidal ﬂux
that emerges in the subsequent cycle under the framework of the BL-type dynamo, is
generated by the emergence and evolution of tilted sunspot groups. The latitudinal
separation and areas of the positive and negative ﬂux dominate the initial axial dipole
moment of the emerged AR. The subsequent ﬂux transport processes over the surface
depend on the latitudinal distribution of the magnetic ﬂux and transport parameters,
which introduce big diﬀerences between the initial and the ﬁnal axial dipole moments
that an AR contributes to the solar cycle. Jiang et al. (2014a) gave an empirical
relation of the latitudinal dependence of the ﬁnal axial dipole moment, which is in
the form of exp (−λ2/110.0). Other studies show a slight diﬀerence in the HWHM
of the Gaussian function (Nagy et al. 2017; Whitbread et al. 2018). This is due to
the meridional ﬂow speeds assumed at low latitudes, which have eﬀects on the rate
and amount of cross-equatorial diﬀusion. Based on the dependence of the ﬁnal axial
dipole moment on the area, tilt angle, and latitudinal location, we deﬁne a dipole
moment index DI as the proxy of the ARs’ eﬀects on the variation of the solar cycle
and on space climate. The form is as follows:

DI = As sin |α| exp (−λ2/110.0),

(2)

where As = A + Af is in units of degree square. The facular area Af is connected to
the sunspot area A by Af = 414 + 21A − 0.0036A2 in units of µHem. The method
is less realistic than the method used in Section 2 to calculate the ﬁnal axial dipole
moment, especially for the δ-type ARs. But the proxy provides a quick and convenient
estimation of the contribution to space climate. The DI values for ARs 12673 and
12674 are 27.34 and 33.47, respectively. Their relative amplitudes are consistent with
the detailed calculations in Section 2 although the estimation cannot distinguish the
positive and the negative contributions to the axial dipole moment. Moreover, for the
statistical analysis here, we do not distinguish the positive and negative contributions
to the solar cycle variation.

The magnetic complexity of ARs has a close correlation with ﬂare eruptions. Here,
we use Mount Wilson magnetic classiﬁcations of ARs to indicate the complexity.
There are two datasets for the classiﬁcations. One is from the Mount Wilson sunspot
record 3 for ARs during 1976-2004 and the other dataset is the NOAA/USAF/SOON

dataset 4 for ARs during 2005-2017. The NOAA numbering system of ARs was not
used in the early time of the dataset. We match the ARs to get their classiﬁcations
using the following method. If there are observations on the day of a given AR at
its maximum area, we match the ARs by comparing the latitude diﬀerence (within
2◦) and the diﬀerence in LDCM (within 10◦).
If there are no observations on the
day of a given AR, the data on the nearby date are used with the consideration of
the shift of the LDCM. Due to the evolution of ARs, a given AR has diﬀerent types
on diﬀerent days when it passes across the solar disk. When the δ structure appears
more than twice, the AR is designated as a δ-type AR. For simplicity, all of the ARs
are classiﬁed into two groups, that is, a complex type that includes the δ structure
(i.e., βγδ or γδ) and a simple type that does not include the δ structure (i.e., α, β,
γ, or βγ).

Table 2 gives the detailed information on the 567 big ARs including the time, NOAA
No., latitude, area, magnetic classiﬁcation, mean tilt angle, standard deviation of tilt
angles, axial dipole moment index, ﬂare index, and maximum fare class.

3.2. Statistical results

Among the 567 big ARs, the percentages of simple and complex ones are 42% and
58%, respectively. The average areas of the complex ARs and simple ARs are 1453
µHem and 1116 µHem, respectively. These show a weak trend for big ARs to be in
the complex conﬁgurations.

Figure 6 shows the scatter plot of the axial dipole moment index DI and the ﬂare
index F I for all of the big ARs. The complex ARs in red dots tend to have strong
space weather eﬀects. The percentage of complex ARs with F I larger than 100, which
is equivalent to the ﬂare class X1, is 81.1%. The weak space weather eﬀects of the rest

of the complex ARs mainly result from our simpliﬁcation of the deﬁnition of the AR
magnetic classiﬁcation. We designate an AR as complex when the δ conﬁguration is
recorded two or more times when it is within 60◦ LDCM. Over a majority of an AR’s
lifetime, the AR probably is in the β structure. The percentage of simple ARs that
have F I smaller than 200, which is equivalent to an X2 ﬂare, is 85.0%. Simple ARs
that have larger FIs usually include mixed polarities, which correspond to the relative
complex γ structure. The axial dipole moment index DI has a strong dependence on
the latitude and the tilt angle of the AR. The red/blue opacity corresponds to the
amplitude of sin |α| exp (−λ2/110.0). Simple and complex ARs have no diﬀerence in
latitudinal emergence. The mean absolute value of the tilt angle of both types of ARs
is about 10◦.5, which is much larger than the mean tilt angle of ARs, 5◦.29 (Baranyi
2015). Furthermore, complex ARs usually have large variations of tilt angles, which
cause a large uncertainty for the estimation of DI. The mean standard deviations
of the tilt angle of simple and complex ARs are 10◦.9 and 12◦.2 respectively. The
percentages of simple and complex ARs whose DI are larger than 10 are 42.7% and
49.7%, respectively. Overall, simple ARs have the same impact as complex ARs on
the solar cycle variation, and hence on space climate.

Figure 7 shows the normal number density distribution of the logarithm values of the
ﬂare index (left panel) and the axial dipole moment index (right panel). For the ﬂare
index, the number density distributions for both simple and complex ARs have similar
proﬁles, but diﬀerent maximum number density location. For the simple ARs, the
ﬂare index F I is mainly concentrated in the bin ranging from 60.2 (log F I = 1.78) to
166.0 (log F I = 2.22). For the complex ARs, the ﬂare index F I is mainly concentrated
in the bin ranging from 166.0 (log F I = 2.22) to 457.1 (log F I = 2.66). By contrast,
the dipole moment index of the simple and complex ARs have the same maximum

shown by red asterisks. The red and blue lines in the left panel are the curve ﬁts between
the area and the ﬂare index.

Figure 8 is the area dependence of the ﬂare index F I and the dipole moment index
DI for both simple and complex ARs. Complex ARs show a stronger correlation
(r = 0.44) between the size of the ARs and the F I values than simple ARs (r = 0.30).
Larger complex ARs tend to have larger F I, which is consistent with Sammis et al.
(2000). The curve ﬁttings for the correlation between the size of ARs and the F I
are F I = 10−2.31A1.53 (complex ARs) and F I = 10−2.74A1.48 (simple ARs). The
power-law indices are close to the results of Takizawa & Kitai (2015), who analyzed
ARs in cycle 23. By contrast, there are no correlations between the size of ARs and
the DI for both the simple and complex ARs although the DI value is proportional
to the area based on Eq.(2). This results from the small area range since only ARs

larger than 800µHem are selected. The DI values are dominated by latitudes and
tilt angles, causing a large range of DI values for a given AR area.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This paper aims to suggest that diﬀerent exceptional ARs have diﬀerent contribu-
tions to space weather and space climate. We note that simple ARs, which are usually
ﬂare-poor, have the same possibility as complex ARs, which are usually ﬂare-rich, to
signiﬁcantly contribute to the long-term variation of the axial dipole moment and
hence to space climate. We take ARs 12673 and 12674 as examples to demonstrate
this idea. A statistical analysis of 567 ARs larger than 800µHem from 1976 to 2017 is
also presented. We suggest two proxies, i.e., the ﬂare index F I and the axial dipole
moment index DI, to quantify the impacts of ARs on space weather and space cli-
mate, respectively. The strong space weather eﬀects imposed by ARs, e.g., the δ-type
AR 12673, mainly depend on the magnetic complexity of ARs. The strong space
climate eﬀects imposed by ARs mainly depend on the latitudinal location and the
latitudinal separation of the positive and negative ﬂuxes. ARs with diﬀerent degrees
of complexity have the same possibility to aﬀect space climate. Furthermore, the
SFT simulation assimilating the isolated AR 12673 indicates that it is an AR with
abnormal polarity, which weakens the axial dipole moment of cycle 24.

The study of diﬀerent exceptional ARs aﬀecting short-term and long-term solar vari-
ability sheds new light on the studies of stellar magnetic activities and stellar magnetic
cycles, especially from the perspective of superﬂares and magnetic ﬁeld topology. As
a byproduct of our study, we have veriﬁed the results of Sammis et al. (2000) based
on our 41 yr samples, which include a much longer dataset than the 8 yr data set
of Sammis et al. (2000). Indeed, magnetic complexity plays a more important role
in producing severe ﬂares than magnetic ﬂux (area). However, there are arguments
based on both observations (Notsu et al. 2013; Candelaresi et al. 2014) and the mod-
elling (Shibata et al. 2013; Kitchatinov & Olemskoy 2016) that the super-ﬂare energy
depends on the total magnetic energy or the dynamo action. Magnetic complexity,
which is relevant to the ﬂux emergence process (Fang & Fan 2015; Chatterjee et al.
2016) and the magnetic ﬁeld topology of the stars (Morin et al. 2008; Petit et al.
2008; See et al. 2016), is usually ignored. Several surveys have uncovered the mag-
netic ﬁeld topologies of stars with diﬀerent ages and spectral types. A nice summary
of large-scale magnetic topologies of cool stars can be found in Lehmann et al. (2018).
If the BL mechanism still works for cool stars, the major idea presented in this pa-
per for the Sun will also be applicable for short-term and long-term stellar activity
variations. Big starspot groups in simple bipolar conﬁgurations have a weak possi-
bility of generating superﬂares, but they could contribute signiﬁcantly to the stellar
poloidal, and hence the toroidal, ﬁeld amplitude provided they emerge around low
latitudes with big tilts. This is likely the case for fast rotators with a strong Coriolis
force. SFT simulations have shown that starspots that emerge at the low latitudes

can be transported to the poles to form the stellar polar spots implied by observations
(Schrijver & Title 2001; Mackay et al. 2004; I¸sık et al. 2011).
