ABSTRACT

Context. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are a common feature of solar and stellar ﬂares, and so the nature of these pulsations
should be understood in order to fully understand ﬂares.
Aims. We investigate the properties of a set of solar ﬂares originating from a single active region that exhibit QPPs, and in particular
look for any indication of the QPP periods relating to active region properties (namely photospheric area, bipole separation distance,
and average magnetic ﬁeld strength at the photosphere), as might be expected if the characteristic timescale of the pulsations corre-
sponds to a characteristic length scale of the structure from which the pulsations originate. The active region studied, known as NOAA
12172/12192/12209, was unusually long-lived and persisted for over three Carrington rotations between September and November
2014. During this time a total of 181 ﬂares were observed by GOES.
Methods. Data from the GOES/XRS, SDO/EVE/ESP, Fermi/GBM, Vernov/DRGE and Nobeyama Radioheliograph observatories
were used to determine if QPPs were present in the ﬂares. For the soft X-ray GOES/XRS and EVE/ESP data, the time derivative
of the signal was used so that any variability in the impulsive phase of the ﬂare was emphasised. Periodogram power spectra of the
time series data (without any form of detrending) were inspected, and ﬂares with a peak above the 95% conﬁdence level in the power
spectrum were labelled as having candidate QPPs. The conﬁdence levels were determined taking full account of data uncertainties
and the possible presence of red noise. Active region properties were determined using SDO/HMI line of sight magnetogram data.
Results. A total of 37 ﬂares (20% of the sample) show good evidence of having stationary or weakly non-stationary QPPs, and some
of the pulsations can be seen in data from multiple instruments and in diﬀerent wavebands. Because the detection method used was
rather conservative, this may be a lower bound for the true number of ﬂares with QPPs. The QPP periods were found to show a
weak correlation with the ﬂare amplitude and duration, but this is likely due to an observational bias. A stronger correlation was found
between the QPP period and duration of the QPP signal, which can be partially but not entirely explained by observational constraints.
No correlations were found with the active region area, bipole separation distance, or average magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Conclusions. The fact that a substantial fraction of the ﬂare sample showed evidence of QPPs using a strict detection method with
minimal processing of the data demonstrates that these QPPs are a real phenomenon, which cannot be explained by the presence of red
noise or the superposition of multiple unrelated ﬂares. The lack of correlation between the QPP periods and active region properties
implies that the small-scale structure of the active region is important, and/or that diﬀerent QPP mechanisms act in diﬀerent cases.

1. Introduction

Despite the large number of observations of quasi-periodic pul-
sations (QPPs) in solar and stellar ﬂares (e.g. Kupriyanova et al.
2010; Simões et al. 2015; Pugh et al. 2016; Hayes et al. 2016;
Inglis et al. 2016), their nature remains mysterious. While it is
diﬃcult to determine the exact cause of the QPPs for any given
case, there are two groups of possible mechanisms that have been
proposed: those based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscil-
lations, and those based on regimes of repetitive magnetic recon-
nection that can be considered in terms of a “magnetic dripping”
model (Nakariakov & Melnikov 2009; Nakariakov et al. 2010;
Van Doorsselaere et al. 2016).

When considering the MHD wave mechanisms, the oscil-
lations could either originate from the ﬂaring structure itself,
or from a nearby structure. For the ﬁrst case, MHD waves
cause plasma parameters to vary periodically, which could ei-

ther directly aﬀect the emission, or could modulate the mag-
netic reconnection rate and acceleration of charged particles,
and hence indirectly aﬀect the emission. For example, for the
case of the sausage mode of a coronal loop, the plasma den-
sity within the loop varies periodically, which in turn causes
the magnetic ﬁeld strength to vary. Hence the gyrosynchrotron
emission in the microwave band would be modulated, and
this variation could also modulate the acceleration of charged
particles (e.g. Zaitsev & Stepanov 2008), which would aﬀect
Bremsstrahlung emission from the loop foot-points. For the sec-
ond case, where the MHD oscillations originate from an ex-
ternal source, the oscillations could leak into the intermediate
plasma. Then as each wavefront reaches the ﬂaring site, micro-
instabilities could be formed which would result in anomalous
resistivity and strong currents near the magnetic null point, hence
triggering magnetic reconnection (McLaughlin & Hood 2004).
Nakariakov et al. (2006) showed that even MHD waves that are

A&Aproofs: manuscript no. ms_print

low in amplitude when they approach the null point are able to
cause strong spikes in the current, due to nonlinear eﬀects. An-
other possibility speciﬁc to two ribbon ﬂares is that slow magne-
toacoustic waves propagate along the axis of the coronal arcade,
periodically triggering reconnection in each of the arcade loops
as they go (Nakariakov & Zimovets 2011).

Numerous MHD simulations have shown regimes of repet-
itive reconnection which do not require a periodic driver.
These regimes are often referred to as “load/unload” or “mag-
netic dripping” mechanisms when relating them to QPPs
(Nakariakov et al. 2010). For example, Murray et al. (2009) and
McLaughlin et al. (2012) performed 2.5D simulations of the
emergence of a ﬂux rope into a coronal hole (with a vertical
magnetic ﬁeld), and found that a current sheet formed. Recon-
nection occurred, with outﬂows from the ends of the current
sheet resulting in a build up of gas pressure in a quasi-bound
region. The increase in the pressure gradient caused the inﬂow
ﬁeld lines to move apart, stopping reconnection, and brought
the outﬂow ﬁeld lines together, causing reconnection to recom-
mence in a diﬀerent conﬁguration. This process repeated in a pe-
riodic manner until eventually an equilibrium state was reached.
Recently, Thurgood et al. (2017) extended this work by demon-
strating that oscillatory reconnection can also occur at a 3D mag-
netic null point. Kliem et al. (2000) instead focussed on a long
current sheet above a soft X-ray coronal loop, and found that
instabilities caused anomalous resistivity and the formation of
magnetic islands as a result of reconnection, which could then
coalesce, forming one or more plasmoids which would then be
ejected. The ejection of multiple plasmoids (and hence result-
ing ﬂare emission) could either be sporadic or quasi-periodic. A
more recent work by Guidoni et al. (2016) investigates charged
particle acceleration in ﬂares, based on the mechanism for elec-
tron acceleration via interactions with magnetic islands proposed
by Drake et al. (2006). They ﬁnd that this mechanism is capable
of explaining the observed electron energies in ﬂares, and also
ﬁnd that it results in sporadic ﬂare emission because of the in-
termittent magnetic island formation, which could relate to ob-
served ﬂare pulsations.

Some of the proposed QPP mechanisms relate the character-
istic timescale of the QPPs to a spatial scale: for example, the
period of an MHD oscillation of a coronal loop relates to the
length of the loop. Hence this motivates looking for correlations
between the QPP periods and spatial scales of the region from
which the ﬂare originates. To do this we chose a set of ﬂares from
a single active region (AR), so that any evolution of the QPP
properties corresponding to the evolution of the AR properties
can be checked for. In addition, focussing on just one AR means
that we can utilise the automatic boundary detection and tracking
algorithm from Higgins et al. (2011), which means that calculat-
ing AR properties around the time of a particular ﬂare can largely
be automated. The AR studied in this work, known as NOAA
12172/12192/12209, was chosen because it produced a large
number of ﬂares (a total of 181 GOES class ﬂares), it existed at a
time when many high-quality solar observation instruments were
operating, and also because it was very long lived, persisting for
around three solar rotations. This AR has been the subject of
several other studies due to its highly active nature, but also be-
cause it is unusual in that none of the X-class ﬂares were accom-
panied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and the few CMEs
that did emerge from the AR were relatively small considering
the amount of ﬂare activity (Thalmann et al. 2015; Panesar et al.
2016; Liu et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016; Drake et al. 2016).

In terms of the detection of the QPPs, in the past many
diﬀerent approaches have been taken. Some examples of these

include manual identiﬁcation (e.g. Kane et al. 1983), searching
for a peak in the periodogram or wavelet power spectrum (usu-
ally after doing some form of detrending of the ﬂare time se-
ries data, e.g. Reznikova & Shibasaki 2011; Kupriyanova et al.
2013; Dennis et al. 2017), and empirical mode decomposition
(Kolotkov et al. 2015). More recently questions have been raised
regarding the potential for false detections with some of the de-
trending methods. This is especially an issue if the data con-
tains red noise, where the data is correlated in time and there-
fore the spectral power is related to the frequency. For example,
Gruber et al. (2011) and Inglis et al. (2015) showed that if red
noise is present in the ﬂare time series data, then detrending the
data can lead to the overestimation of the signiﬁcance of a signal.
In addition, Auchère et al. (2016) showed that if a signal con-
taining red noise is detrended by subtracting a boxcar-smoothed
version of the signal from the original signal before calculating
the power spectrum, then the power spectrum will contain what
looks like a broad peak, but this apparent spectral feature is com-
pletely artiﬁcial. While the trends in ﬂare time series data cannot
be considered to be entirely “random walk” red noise, since there
seems to be a general characteristic shape that ﬂare light curves
follow (a rapid rise followed by a more gradual decay), ﬁnding
the true trend of the ﬂare is a huge challenge in itself when many
ﬂares show deviations from the characteristic shape. For this rea-
son Pugh et al. (2017) demonstrated two related methods, based
on the method of Vaughan (2005), to assess the signiﬁcance
of periodic signals in ﬂares, accounting for the presence of red
noise and data uncertainties and without any form of detrending.
In this work we apply the methods of Pugh et al. (2017) to the set
of ﬂares from the AR NOAA 12172/12192/12209. The methods
could complement that used by (Inglis et al. 2016), which also
avoids detrending and accounts for the presence of red noise, but
instead involves a power spectrum model comparison.

This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the
solar ﬂare and AR magnetogram data used. Sect. 3 summarises
the QPP detection method, including details of the use of time
derivative data and how it impacts on the power spectrum, and
also describes how the AR properties were obtained. The results
and discussion of the search for the QPPs themselves along with
any correlations with ﬂare or AR properties are given in Sect. 4,
and ﬁnally conclusions are given in Sect. 5.

2. Observations

Data were used from the X-ray sensor (XRS) aboard the Geo-
stationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), which
makes near continuous observations of the Sun in two soft
X-ray (SXR) wavebands, 1–8 Å (1.5–12.4 keV) and 0.5–4 Å
(3.1–24.8 keV), with a cadence of 2.047 s. Simões et al. (2015)
showed that the irradiance steps due to the digitisation of the
data are greater than the Poisson noise from counting statistics.
Therefore, we used half of the irradiance step size as a function
of the irradiance as an estimate of the uncertainty for each mea-
surement.

We also made use of the Extreme ultraviolet SpectroPho-
tometer (ESP) channel of the Extreme ultraviolet Variability
Experiment (EVE) aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO), which observes the 1–70 Å (0.18–12.4 keV) ex-
treme ultraviolet (EUV) and SXR waveband (Didkovsky et al.
2012). This waveband overlaps with the GOES wavebands, and
since all of the ﬂares in this study were observed by GOES, the
EVE/ESP data can be used to rule out the possibility that a peri-
odic signal in the GOES data is due to an artefact and is unrelated

C. E. Pugh et al.: Properties of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar ﬂares from a single active region

to the ﬂare (Hayes et al. 2016; Dennis et al. 2017). The time ca-
dence of ESP is 0.25 s, but in order to estimate the uncertainties
these measurements were binned down to a 1 s cadence, and the
standard deviation of the measurements within each 1 s time bin
was used as the uncertainty. The disadvantage of this instrument
when searching for QPPs is that the waveband is very broad, so
much of the ﬁne structure of the ﬂare is smeared out due to the
Neupert eﬀect.

The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) aboard NASA’s
Fermi satellite (Meegan et al. 2009) measures X- and gamma-
ray photons with energies between 4 keV and around 40 MeV.
We made use of the CSPEC data, which has 128 energy chan-
nels that we combined into three energy ranges: 6–25 keV, 25–
50 keV, and 50–100 keV. These energy ranges were chosen so
that comparisons could be made with data from NASA’s Reuven
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI),
however the RHESSI data for the sample of ﬂares examined in
this study did not show any signiﬁcant QPP signals using the
method described in Sect. 3. The time cadence of the CSPEC
observations is 4.096 s, or 1.024 s when the count rate exceeds
a certain threshold and GBM goes into “trigger” mode for a set
amount of time. A better time resolution can be obtained from
the CTIME data, with a cadence of 0.256/0.064 s, however this
data is noisier and hence we did not ﬁnd that it oﬀered much
of a beneﬁt over the CSPEC data for the study of QPPs. GBM
consists of 2 BGO and 12 NaI detectors which all point in dif-
ferent directions, therefore the angle between the detectors and
the Sun must be checked, which we did using the IDL Solar
Software routine gbm_get_det_cos. Data from the most sunward
NaI detector at the time of the ﬂare were used with the excep-
tion of ﬂares greater than M5 class, where data from the most
sunward detector may be subject to discontinuities due to gain
changes. Therefore the second most sunward detector was cho-
sen for these ﬂares. Because of the orbit of the Fermi satellite, it
cannot observe solar ﬂares while in the Earth’s shadow.

Hard X-ray (HXR) data were also obtained with the Detector
of the Roentgen and Gamma-ray Emissions (DRGE) instrument
aboard the Russian satellite Vernov (Myagkova et al. 2016). The
spacecraft had a solar-synchronous orbit with the following pa-
rameters: an apogee of 830 km, perigee of 640 km, inclination
of 98.4◦, and an orbital period of 100 min. It was launched on
2014 July 8 and operated until 2014 December 10. The DRGE
instrument included four identical detector blocks (DRGE11,
DRGE12, DRGE21 and DRGE22), based on a NaI(Tl)/CsI(Tl)
phoswich. The diameter of both scintillators was 13 cm, while
the NaI(Tl) thickness was 0.3 cm, and the CsI(Tl) thickness
1.7 cm. These detector blocks were designed for measuring ter-
restrial gamma ﬂashes and other atmospheric phenomena, so
they were directed towards the Earth. The Sun was to the side
of the detectors (
90◦ from the zenith angle) during the whole
period of ﬂare observations, so the eﬀective area of the detectors
was only a few cm2. A more detailed description of the experi-
ment along with a catalogue of HXR solar ﬂares from the active
regions NOAA 12172 and 12192 observed by Vernov is given
in Myagkova et al. (2016). In the present work we processed the
data of six ﬂares from this catalogue: those where the possibil-
ity of detecting QPPs appeared most evident. The monitoring
parameter “count rates of all events in NaI” was used, and for
solar ﬂare emission this refers to the integral channel of pho-
tons with energy >30 keV. The time resolution of the measure-
ments was 1 s. Vernov was a polar low-altitude satellite, thus the
background conditions for solar ﬂares were far from optimal,
hence two methods of background rejection were used. In the
equatorial regions and in the polar caps the background was es-

∼

timated from the count rates shortly before and after a ﬂare, and
in the regions close to the Earth’s radiation belts we also took
into account count rates from the previous orbits. Poisson count-
ing statistics was assumed, so the uncertainties for each count
rate measurement were taken to be equal to the square root of
the count rate.

Correlation data with a microwave frequency of 17 GHz and
a cadence of 1 s from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)
(Nakajima et al. 1994), which is more sensitive to emission from
small spatial-scale structures on the Sun rather than the global
emission, were also used. Because NoRH is ground-based, solar
observations are only made between 22:45 and 06:30 UT each
day. The uncertainty of the data was estimated to be 1.1911749
10−
(Pugh et al. 2017).

Finally, properties of the active region (AR) were determined
using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
aboard SDO (Scherrer et al. 2012). Line of sight magnetogram
images were used with a reduced cadence of one hour, and res-
olution of 1024
1024 pixels. The timescale of the evolution of
an AR is typically much greater than an hour, and the reduced
resolution does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the properties calculated,
while it does greatly speed up the calculations. The three time
intervals corresponding to the AR’s three crossings of the so-
lar disk were chosen to be 2014 September 22 15:00:34 until
September 30 08:00:33, 2014 October 19 15:00:30 until October
27 02:00:30, and 2014 November 16 15:00:27 until November
23 08:00:26, where the AR labels during its three crossings are
NOAA 12172, NOAA 12192, and NOAA 12209 respectively.
Fig. 1 shows magnetogram images of the AR during these three
time intervals. Note that times when the AR was close to the
solar limb were omitted, as line of sight eﬀects mean the AR
magnetogram images near the limb are highly distorted, and so
AR properties cannot be obtained reliably. Unfortunately many
of the ﬂares from the AR occurred outside of these time ranges,
so these ﬂares had to be excluded when looking for relationships
between the QPP periods and AR properties (see Table 2).

3. Data analysis

The basic outline of our approach to identifying candidate QPPs
in the sample of solar ﬂares is as follows. All available light
curves for the ﬂares were manually shortened to focus on sec-
tions showing the most variability. Shortening the light curves
when searching for QPP signals is often helpful due to the tran-
sient nature of QPPs, and also because of the presence of back-
ground trends which inﬂuence the shape of the power spectrum.
Some more complex ﬂares showed variability in more than one
section, so these diﬀerent sections of light curve were analysed
separately. The longest allowed light curve durations were the
same as the ﬂare durations, and the shortest were 16 times the
data time cadence. Because the methods for calculating the con-
ﬁdence levels (see Sect. 3.2) require even time sampling, any
gaps in the data were avoided when manually choosing the time
intervals. Additionally, times when there was a switch between
trigger mode and non-trigger mode in the Fermi data were also
avoided. For the light curves from SXR observations, the time
derivative was calculated and used for further analysis (see Sect.
3.1).

Lomb-Scargle periodograms were calculated for all of these
shortened light curves. No window function was applied to the
shortened light curve prior to calculating the periodogram, as
doing so would alter the distribution of the noise and addition-
ally may not be beneﬁcial for the detection of low amplitude

component of the signal. This was done simply by decreasing,
then increasing the start time by one data point at a time, to
search for a start time which maximised the signiﬁcance of the
peak in the power spectrum. This iterative process was repeated
with the end time, then again with the start time, in order to ﬁnd
the maximum conﬁdence level of the peak. If multiple signiﬁ-
cant spectral peaks were found then these would be listed sep-
arately in the results, although there were no cases where we
found multiple periods in the same section of light curve and
same waveband. Flares with a peak in the power spectrum above
the 95% conﬁdence level were included in the sample of ﬂares
with strong candidate QPPs, and used to study the QPP proper-
ties.

3.1. Time derivative data

Making use of the time derivative of high-precision SXR ob-
servations has been shown to be useful for the study of QPPs
(Simões et al. 2015; Hayes et al. 2016; Dennis et al. 2017). Tak-
ing the derivative will have a signiﬁcant impact on the power
spectrum of time series data, however, and so it is extremely
important to understand this impact when assessing the signif-
icance of peaks in the power spectrum. One of the most basic
numerical approximations to the derivative of time series data is
a three-point ﬁnite diﬀerence, deﬁned as:

transient signals. A broken power law model was ﬁtted to the
periodograms (see Pugh et al. 2017), and model uncertainties
at each frequency index were estimated by performing Monte
Carlo simulations. The 95% and 99% conﬁdence levels were
then calculated (see Sect. 3.2) taking account of any power law
dependence of the spectrum and uncertainties associated with
the model ﬁts. Additionally, rebinned power spectra were cal-
culated in order to better assess the signiﬁcance of any broader
peaks that spanned more than one frequency bin in the regular
power spectra (Appourchaux 2004).

We did not consider peaks with a period less than four times
the cadence or greater than a quarter of the duration of the time
series data as candidate QPP signals, as we do not believe peri-
ods in these ranges can be detected reliably without supporting
data from another instrument with a higher time resolution.

The start and end times of the light curves were reﬁned man-
ually in order to maximise the conﬁdence level of any periodic

where ω is an angular frequency which ranges from 0 to 2π. The
Fourier power spectrum is the square of the absolute value of the
Fourier transform, so for the power spectrum we have:

The periodogram of evenly spaced data with no oversampling is
equivalent to the discrete Fourier power spectrum with additional
normalisation, and so this sin2(ω) multiplying term will appear
when the periodogram of time derivative data is calculated. For a
perfectly periodic signal, the periodogram of the time derivative
h2 sin2(ω) multiplied by the peri-
of the signal will be equal to 1
odogram of the original signal. Flare time series data is not com-
pletely periodic, however, and the presence of background trends
will have a substantial impact on the power spectra. Taking the
time derivative will suppress slowly-varying background trends,
and hence if a periodic component of the signal is present it will
be more visible in the time derivative power spectrum. Taking
the time derivative is most beneﬁcial for SXR ﬂare observations,
since the impulsive phase of a ﬂare is best seen in the HXR and
microwave/radio wavebands, and the Neupert eﬀect means this
phase corresponds to a rise in the SXR emission. Hence QPPs
which are most often seen in the impulsive phase of a ﬂare will
appear during the rise of the SXR emission, and this rising trend
will make QPPs less visible in the power spectrum. For all SXR
observations used in this study, from GOES/XRS and EVE/ESP,
the time derivatives of the signals have been used, and the power
spectra have been divided by sin2(ω) before proceeding to calcu-
late the conﬁdence levels. Note that because ω varies between 0
(at the lowest frequency sampled) and π (at the highest frequency
sampled) for the positive frequencies, this means that sin2(ω) is
equal to zero at the edges of the power spectrum, hence the pow-
ers at the lowest and highest frequencies of the power spectrum
cannot be calculated. In addition, where ω is close to 0 and π,
sin2(ω) is very small and therefore numerical uncertainties will
have a bigger impact. To avoid this, all derivative power spectra
have had the ﬁrst and ﬁnal 2% of frequencies removed, with the
exception of power spectra with less than 50 data points, which
have the ﬁrst and last points removed.

3.2. Conﬁdence levels

The methods used to calculate the 95% and 99% conﬁdence lev-
els on the power spectra are described in detail in Pugh et al.
(2017), and are based on the test described by Vaughan (2005).
The ﬁrst method addresses regular power spectra, and the second
rebinned power spectra. In this section we brieﬂy summarise the
methods, but direct readers to Pugh et al. (2017) for a more thor-
ough description.

The conﬁdence level corresponding to a particular false
alarm probability, γǫ j , is the level where the probability of having
one or more points, ˆγ j, in the power spectrum above that level is
approximately equal to the false alarm probability divided by the
number of data points in the power spectrum, N′, if the original
time series signal is due to random noise:

Pr

ˆγ j > γǫ j
n

o ≈

ǫN′
N′

.

(10)

This probability is equal to the probability density function inte-
grated between γǫ j and inﬁnity, and the overall probability den-
sity function can be found by combining those of the chi-squared
distribution of the noise and the log-normal distribution of the

uncertainty of a ﬁt to the power spectrum at a particular fre-
quency index. Because the combined probability density func-
tion is an integral, the probability must be found by solving a
double integral. For regular power spectra (where the noise fol-
lows a chi-squared 2 degrees of freedom distribution) one of the
integrals can be solved analytically, simplifying the equation for
the probability to:

Rebinning the power spectrum by summing together the
powers in every n frequency bins, in order to better assess the
power contained in a peak that spans more than one frequency
bin, will alter the distribution of the noise. Fortunately this is
straightforward to account for. The noise in the rebinned power
spectrum will follow a chi-squared 2n degrees of freedom distri-
bution rather than chi-squared 2 degrees of freedom, which is the
case for the regular power spectrum (Appourchaux 2004). The
value of n can be chosen depending on how broad the spectral
peak of interest is; for the ﬂares considered in this study either
n = 2 or n = 3 gave the best results. The probability density
function corresponding to this diﬀerent distribution of the noise
can be combined with that of the log-normal distribution of the
uncertainty of the power law ﬁt to the power spectrum to give
the overall probability density function, which can then be inte-
grated between γǫ j and inﬁnity, as before, to give the probability
of having a value in the rebinned power spectrum above a cer-
tain threshold. This probability equation for the rebinned power
spectra can be simpliﬁed to:

where n is the number of frequency bins summed over, and
Γ(n, wγǫ j/2) is the upper incomplete gamma function.

Equations 11 and 12 should then be equated to Eq. 10 and
solved numerically in order to determine γǫ j . The conﬁdence
level would be equal to γǫ j if the spectral powers were indepen-
dent of the frequency and normalised so that the mean power
were equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the chi-
squared distribution of the noise (i.e. 2 for the regular power
spectra, or 2n for the rebinned spectra). Instead we are dealing
with power spectra that are not normalised and have a power law
dependence. The regular power spectra could be normalised by
multiplying by 2/
, or alternatively γǫ j can be multiplied
i
/2 to account for the lack of normalisation, where I j is
by

the original power spectrum, ˆ
j is a broken power law ﬁt to the

power spectrum, and
is the mean of the “ﬂattened” power
spectrum (with the power law dependence removed). Finally the
power law dependence needs to be accounted for by multiplying
/2 by the power law ﬁt, or adding if working in log

space. Hence the conﬁdence level for the regular power spec-
trum is equal to log[ ˆ

3.3. Active region properties

±

The processing of the HMI line of sight magnetograms and
calculation of some AR properties was done using the Solar-
Monitor Active Region Tracking (SMART) routines provided by
Higgins et al. (2011). For each AR crossing of the solar disk
(while within around
60◦ of the central meridian line, since
the AR images are highly distorted when close to the limb), the
processing technique is as follows. First the magnetogram frame
where the AR is approximately half way across the solar disk
was used to determine a bounding box around the AR. ARs vis-
ible on the disk at that time were detected automatically accord-
ing to Higgins et al. (2011). After selecting the AR of interest,
the X and Y coordinate ranges of the SMART detection out-
line were used to deﬁne a box around the AR. Next, the line of
sight projection eﬀect of features closer to the limb appearing
smaller compared to when closer to the centre of the solar disk
is accounted for by diﬀerentially rotating the other magnetogram
frames to the time where the AR is approximately at the central
meridian, using the IDL Solar Software routine drot_map. The
previously deﬁned box was then used to crop all frames to in-
clude only the AR of interest.

In order to estimate the AR photospheric area as a function
of time, pixels within the bounding box with an absolute mag-
netic ﬁeld strength greater than a threshold value of 70 G were
selected. This threshold was chosen as quiet Sun regions tend to
have magnetic ﬁeld values less than this (Higgins et al. 2011).
For each selected pixel, the area of the solar surface that the
pixel would correspond to if it were located at the disk centre
was multiplied by a cosine correction factor, to account for the
spherical nature of the Sun meaning that diﬀerent pixels corre-
spond to diﬀerent surface areas (McAteer et al. 2005), then the
resulting values were summed together to obtain an AR area for
a particular magnetogram frame.

The bipole separation is deﬁned as (Mackay et al. 2011):

S =

where S(t) is the vector pointing from the centre of one pole
to the other, Bz(i, j) is the line of sight magnetic ﬁeld at pixel
position (i, j), and Ri, j is the position vector pointing from the
origin to the pixel at (i, j). Once the bipole separation, S , had
been calculated it was then converted to a great circle distance in
Mm.

Finally, the average magnetic ﬁeld strength of the active re-
gion at the photosphere as a function of time was calculated by
summing together the absolute magnetic ﬁeld strength values of
all pixels in a particular magnetogram frame with a magnitude
greater than the threshold value of 70 G, then dividing by the
number of pixels with absolute values greater than the threshold.

4. Results and discussion

4.1. The set of ﬂares with QPPs

(SWPC)1, and the spatial location of the ﬂares was checked us-
ing SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 94 Å diﬀerence
images provided by SolarMonitor2 (Gallagher et al. 2002), to en-
sure that the ﬂares originated from the active region of interest.
After searching each of the ﬂares for evidence of QPPs using
the methods described in Sect. 3, a total of 37 ﬂares with con-
vincing candidate QPPs were identiﬁed, corresponding to 20%
of ﬂares in the sample. These ﬂares are summarised in Table
2, where the upper and lower uncertainties for each period are
taken to be plus or minus half of the corresponding frequency
bin width in the power spectrum. Note that for some of these
ﬂares, QPPs were found in more than one section of the ﬂare
light curve, while there were no cases where multiple signiﬁ-
cant periods were found in the same section of light curve ob-
served in a particular waveband. The vast majority of the QPPs
occurred during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, with the only
exception being the ﬂare labelled “022” in Tables 1 and 2, where
the QPPs were predominantly in the decay phase. Plots show-
ing the time series data and power spectra of one of these ﬂares
as an example are given in Figs. 2 and 3, while similar plots
for the other 36 ﬂares are shown by Figs. A.1–A.46 in the Ap-
pendix. A histogram of the QPP periods is given in the left-hand
panel of Fig. 4, and if a log-normal distribution is assumed (more
data is needed to conﬁrm if this model is a good approxima-
tion, but similar histograms shown by Inglis et al. (2016) also
appear to have a log-normal distribution), then the average QPP
period for this set of ﬂares is 20+16
9 s. This seems to be consistent
−
with the results of Inglis et al. (2016). The right-hand panel of
Fig. 4 shows separate histograms for the QPP periods detected
by GOES/XRS, and those detected by EVE/ESP, Fermi/GBM,
NoRH, and Vernov/DRGE. The distribution for GOES/XRS ap-
pears to be shifted slightly towards longer periods than the other
instruments, which could be explained by the other instruments
having a higher time resolution and also only capturing the im-
pulsive phase of the ﬂare. GOES/XRS has a lower time resolu-
tion and observes both the impulsive and gradual phases of the
ﬂare, meaning that the detection of shorter periods is limited by
the time resolution, whereas longer periods can be seen more
easily.

Seven ﬂares (those labelled 056, 072, 104, 106, 135, 142,
and 152 in Tables 1 and 2) have a QPP signal from two diﬀer-
ent instruments above the 95% conﬁdence level in their power
spectrum, which rules out the possibility that these signals are
due to some instrumental artefact. A further two ﬂares (010 and
024) have peaks just below the 95% level in the EVE/ESP power
spectra at the same period as those seen above the 95% level in
the GOES/XRS data. On the other hand, three of the ﬂares (010,
037, and 038) have QPPs observed in two diﬀerent wavebands
over the same time range, but with diﬀerent periods. According
to the standard ﬂare model, diﬀerent wavebands of the emission
originate from diﬀerent positions within the ﬂaring region, so
these could be unrelated periodic signals originating from dif-
ferent places, or alternatively they could result from the same
process, but be shifted from one another due to changes in the
local physical parameters.

It is slightly surprising that the majority of signiﬁcant QPP
detections made by GOES/XRS are not supported by EVE/ESP,
considering both instruments observe the Sun near continuously
and have overlapping observational wavebands. A possible rea-
son for this is that the EVE/ESP waveband is so wide. QPPs are
often more visible in a particular waveband than others (which

Details of all 181 ﬂares used in the analysis are given in Table 1.

ﬂares provided by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Centre

could relate to the mechanism or spatial origin of the signal),
or they could be phase shifted across diﬀerent wavelengths.
These would result in the signal being hidden or blurred in wide
waveband observations. The visibility of QPP signals in diﬀer-
ent wavebands would also explain the other cases where there
is a detection in one instrument but not another over the same
time range. Alternatively the cause may simply be that the ﬂare
signal-to-noise ratio is lower for EVE/ESP than GOES/XRS,
thus making any QPP signals in the EVE/ESP data more diﬃcult
to detect above the noise level. Also of note are the diﬀerences
between the two overlapping GOES/XRS wavebands. In most
cases a signal can be seen in both wavebands even if it is not
above the 95% conﬁdence level threshold, while there are a few
cases where the signal can only be seen in the power spectrum
of one of the wavebands. An explanation of this could be a com-
bination of the Neupert eﬀect resulting in a steeper trend in one
of the waveband light curves compared to the other, and that the
optimal choice of time interval for one waveband might not be
the same as for the other waveband. Pugh et al. (2017) demon-
strated that steeper trends in light curves result in QPP signals
having a lower signiﬁcance in the power spectra. Alternatively
there could be a physical reason for the QPP signal appearing
stronger in one of the wavebands over the other, based on the
QPP mechanism.

Inglis et al. (2016) looked for QPPs in all M- and X-class
ﬂares in the GOES/XRS and Fermi/GBM data between 2011
February 01 and 2015 December 31, meaning that 44 of those
ﬂares are included in this study (ﬂares included in the Inglis et al.
(2016) sample are indicated in Table 1). Rather than shortening
the ﬂare time series to focus on a section showing a potential
QPP signal like in this work, Inglis et al. (2016) use the ﬂare
start and end times from the GOES catalogue in order to auto-
mate their method. Their method involves a model comparison,
where three diﬀerent models are ﬁtted to the ﬂare power spec-
tra, compared by calculating the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) for each, and checked for a reasonable goodness of ﬁt.
The three models are a single power law plus constant (model
S 0), a power law plus Gaussian bump and constant (model S 1),
and a broken power law plus constant (model S 2). A lower BIC
value means a more favoured model, and Inglis et al. (2016) im-
poses a selection criterion that model S 1 should have a BIC
value that is at least 10 less than those for models S 0 and S 2,
so only cases where model S 1 is strongly favoured over models
S 0 and S 2 are considered. They also require the models to be ﬁt
to the power spectra suﬃciently well, based on a goodness-of-
ﬁt statistic. We ﬁnd similar periods (within the 1σ uncertain-
ties) to Inglis et al. (2016) for six ﬂares: 029, 056, 135, 140,
152, 153, and a further seven ﬂares when the selection criteria
of Inglis et al. (2016) are relaxed: 049, 054, 085, 104, 105, 117,
161. We consider periods identiﬁed with relaxed selection crite-
ria here (all cases where model S 1 is preferred over model S 0)
because these are cases where a period identiﬁed by the auto-
mated method of Inglis et al. (2016) does not quite match their
selection criteria, while this study ﬁnds the same period to be
signiﬁcant. Therefore we regard these cases as promising and
worthy of mention. In addition we ﬁnd the same periodic sig-
nals identiﬁed by Myagkova et al. (2016) in ﬂares 010, 056, and
135. We ﬁnd diﬀerent signiﬁcant periods than Inglis et al. (2016)
from the same instrument for one ﬂare: 092, and diﬀerent sig-
niﬁcant periods from diﬀerent instruments for one ﬂare: 098.
The three ﬂares where there is a signiﬁcant period identiﬁed by
Inglis et al. (2016) but not the present study are 075, 115, and
139, and the two ﬂares where the present study ﬁnds a signif-
icant period whereas Inglis et al. (2016) does not are 008 and

072. For the remaining 24 ﬂares both this work and Inglis et al.
(2016) ﬁnd no convincing evidence of QPPs. We believe that
the majority of cases where the results of this work diﬀer from
Inglis et al. (2016) can be explained by the diﬀerent time inter-
vals used or diﬀerent detection criteria. For example, we neglect
any periods that are less than four times the cadence or greater
than a quarter of the length of the time series data as these are
diﬃcult to detect reliably, whereas Inglis et al. (2016) requires a
model containing a QPP signal to be suﬃciently favoured over
two alternative models.

4.2. Comparing QPP and ﬂare properties

Figures 5 and 6 show a weak correlation of the QPP period the
ﬂare amplitude in the GOES 1-8 Å waveband and a moderate
correlation with the ﬂare duration, which is consistent with the
ﬂare amplitude being correlated with the duration (e.g. Lu et al.
1993; Veronig et al. 2002). The ﬂare durations were estimated
from the GOES 1-8 Å data, and were taken as the time between
when the intensity begins increasing above the base level and
when the intensity returns to the base level. Duplicate points,
where the same QPP signal can be seen in multiple instruments
or wavelength ranges, are omitted. This apparent correlation may
be due to observational constraints, however, since the short pe-
riods tend to be more easily visible in the shorter duration ﬂares,
while the detection of long periods is only possible in the longer
duration ﬂares. In addition, Inglis et al. (2016) found no correla-
tion between the period and GOES class for a larger sample of
ﬂares.

Figure 7 shows a positive correlation between the QPP pe-
riod and the duration of the QPP signal, for which we use the
time interval that gave the most signiﬁcant peak in the power
spectrum (see Sect. 3). Fitting a linear model gives a relation-
ship:

log P = (0.62

0.03) log τ

(0.07

±

−

0.07),

±

(14)

where P is the period and τ is the QPP signal duration time. Ob-
servational constraints mean that the maximum detectable pe-
riod will depend on the time interval being used, so longer pe-
riods will require longer durations, however this does not ex-
plain why short periods with longer durations are not seen. We
also note that the relationship is diﬀerent from the period ver-
sus decay time relationships found by Cho et al. (2016) and
Pugh et al. (2016), although these studies focussed on decaying
QPPs whereas many of the QPP signals included in the present
study do not show a clear decay, and appear more like a set of
periodic pulses rather than a harmonic signal.

A plot of QPP period against the time at which the QPP sig-
nal occurs is shown in Fig. 8, where there is no clear trend in
how the periods change with time. It can be seen that the ma-
jority of the QPPs were found during the AR’s second crossing
of the solar disk (as NOAA 12192), but this is simply because
most of the ﬂares occurred during this time as shown by the grey
shaded region.

4.3. Comparing QPP and active region properties

Figures 9–11 show scatter plots of the QPP period with total
area, bipole separation distance, and average photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld strength of the AR around the time of the QPP sig-
nal onset, respectively. These plots show no correlation between
the QPP periods and AR properties, which, if the characteristic

timescale of the QPPs is assumed to be related to a characteris-
tic length scale, suggests that the ﬁne structure of the AR may
be important since diﬀerent structures within the AR will have
diﬀerent length scales. Another possibility is that for diﬀerent
QPP mechanisms, the characteristic length scale has a diﬀerent
relationship with the characteristic timescale, and that diﬀerent
mechanisms are responsible for diﬀerent QPP signals.

5. Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that 37 out of 181 ﬂares from a
single active region show good evidence of having stationary or
weakly non-stationary QPPs using methods that limit the poten-
tial for false detections, and using data from several diﬀerent
instruments observing diﬀerent wavelength ranges. On the other
hand, this may be a lower limit for the true number of ﬂares in
the sample with QPPs. For example, the presence of background
trends due to the ﬂare itself can mask QPP signals in the power
spectrum (Pugh et al. 2017), the QPPs could be non-stationary

a 2 s cadence, and the green line shows those detected by EVE/ESP, Fermi/GBM, NoRH, and Vernov/DRGE with a 1 s cadence. The distribution
for GOES/XRS appears to be shifted slightly towards longer periods than the other instruments.

Fig. 8. QPP periods plotted against the approximate time at which the
QPP signal begins. There is no obvious trend suggesting that there is no
characteristic timescale which is evolving with time. The grey shaded
region indicates the number of ﬂares that occurred on a particular day.

Bipole separation (Mm)

Fig. 10. QPP periods plotted against the separation of the centres of
positive and negative magnetic ﬂux in the AR at the time of the ﬂare.
The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient is 0.01, suggesting no correlation.

(where the period drifts with time, e.g. Kupriyanova et al. 2010)
and hence would not have a well deﬁned peak in the power spec-
trum, the QPPs could be too low amplitude or have the wrong
period to be detectable with the instruments operating at the
time, or lower quality QPP signals could have been missed dur-
ing the manual search stage. Additionally we show how taking
the time derivative of light curve data, which has previously been
shown to be useful when searching for QPPs (Simões et al. 2015;
Hayes et al. 2016; Dennis et al. 2017), impacts the power spec-
trum, and suggest how this can be accounted for when searching
for periodic signals. Out of the 44 ﬂares in this sample that over-
lap with those included by Inglis et al. (2016), we ﬁnd the same
periods in 6 (or 13 if the selection criteria used by Inglis et al.
(2016) are relaxed) and agree with the lack of evidence of a QPP
signal in a further 24. For the other ﬂares either only one method
identiﬁes a periodic signal, or the periods identiﬁed by the diﬀer-
ent methods are diﬀerent. The mean period for the QPPs in our
sample is 20+16
9 s. We also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation between
the period and QPP duration, and while we acknowledge that ob-
servational constraints may be part of the cause we believe this
cannot fully explain the strong correlation.

Three properties of the AR from which the ﬂares originate
(namely area, bipole separation and average photospheric mag-

netic ﬁeld strength) have been tracked over time, to test for any
correlation with the QPP periods. No correlations were found,
which could either suggest that the small-scale structure within
the AR is more important, that diﬀerent mechanisms act in dif-
ferent cases, or that the sausage mode is responsible for the
QPPs, since the oscillation period may be only weakly depen-
dent on the length of the hosting coronal loop for the sausage
mode (Nakariakov et al. 2012). For this reason we aim to make
use of spatially resolved observations of the ﬂares themselves in
future work.

Table 1. Summary table of the 181 ﬂares from the chosen active region. The ﬁrst column contains a numerical label for each ﬂare, the second and
third columns are the ﬂare start and end times (UT), the fourth column is the ﬂare GOES class, the ﬁfth the approximate position on the solar disk.
The sixth column shows which instruments, other than GOES/XRS and EVE/ESP, observed the ﬂare, where R, F, N, V correspond to RHESSI,
Fermi/GBM, NoRH, and Vernov/DRGE respectively, and (part) indicates that only part of the ﬂare was observed by that instrument. Finally, the
seventh column contains references to other studies that include the ﬂare.

Flare no.

Table 2. List of ﬂares with a peak above the 95% conﬁdence level in the power spectrum. The ﬁrst column contains a numerical label for the ﬂares
(see also Table 1), the second and third columns give the start and end times of the section of the ﬂare where the QPP signal is most visible in the
power spectrum, the fourth column is the instrument used, the ﬁfth column is the type of power spectrum in which the signal was detected (the
numbers for the rebinned power spectra refer to the number of frequency bins that were summed over, see Sect. 3), the sixth column is the QPP
period, and ﬁnally the seventh column gives references to other studies that ﬁnd pulsations in the ﬂare. Flare numbers marked with an asterisk
indicate those which occurred while the active region was far enough away from the solar limb so that active region properties could be determined.

Flare no.
