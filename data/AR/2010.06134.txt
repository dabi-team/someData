ABSTRACT
A hemispheric preference in the dominant sign of magnetic helicity has been observed
in numerous features in the solar atmosphere:
i.e., left-handed/right-handed helicity
in the northern/southern hemisphere. The relative importance of diﬀerent physical
processes which may contribute to the observed hemispheric sign preference (HSP)
of magnetic helicity is still under debate. Here, we estimate magnetic helicity ﬂux
(dH/dt) across the photospheric surface for 4,802 samples of 1,105 unique active regions
(ARs) that appeared over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017 during solar cycle 24,
using photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld observations by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The estimates of dH/dt
show that 63% and 65% of the investigated AR samples in the northern and southern
hemispheres, respectively, follow the HSP. We also ﬁnd a trend that the HSP of dH/dt
70 – 80% as ARs (1) appear at the earlier inclining
increases from
, the
phase of the solar cycle or higher latitudes; (2) have larger values of
total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, and the average plasma ﬂow speed. These observational
ﬁndings support the enhancement of the HSP mainly by the Coriolis force acting on
a buoyantly rising and expanding ﬂux tube through the turbulent convection zone. In
addition, the diﬀerential rotation on the solar surface as well as the tachocline α-eﬀect
of ﬂux-transport dynamo may reinforce the HSP for ARs at higher latitudes.

1. INTRODUCTION

Over the past decades, extensive observations of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the
corona have revealed a hemispheric preference in the dominant sign of magnetic helicity, speciﬁcally a
dominance of negative (left-handed) helicity in the northern hemisphere and positive (right-handed)

helicity in the southern hemisphere, independent of the solar cycle. This is the so-called hemi-
spheric sign preference (hereafter referred to as HSP) observed in numerous magnetic structures
in the Sun. For example, a majority of sunspot penumbral ﬁbrils in the northern/southern hemi-
sphere show counterclockwise/clockwise rotations from outside to inside (Hale 1927; Richardson 1941;
Ding et al. 1987; Pevtsov & Balasubramaniam 2003). Solar prominences in the northern/southern
hemisphere tend to be composed of dextral/sinistral channels with right-bearing/left-bearing barbs
(Martin et al. 1994; Pevtsov et al. 2003; Lim & Chae 2009; Ouyang et al. 2017); this tendency is
found in all cases of prominences and ﬁlaments: active-region, intermediate, and quiescent, with
diﬀerent degrees of compliance. Bright coronal loops displaying a distinct “S-shape” (called sig-
moids) show their hemispheric preference in their shape as observed in (for example) soft X-ray
emission, i.e., an inverse/forward S-shape in the northern/southern hemisphere (Rust & Kumar 1996;
Canﬁeld et al. 1999; Savcheva et al. 2014). This HSP is also found in strong-ﬁeld plage and sunspot
regions, as well as in quiet-Sun network regions, by means of the force-free-ﬁeld parameter α and
the vertical component of current helicity density calculated from photospheric vector magnetograms
(Pevtsov et al. 1995; Zhang & Bao 1999; Pevtsov & Longcope 2001; Gao et al. 2013; Gosain et al.
2013; Otsuji et al. 2015). Furthermore, near-Earth in situ observations of interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICMEs) show that the handedness of twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines in ICMEs is well
matched with that estimated in their solar source ARs (Cho et al. 2013), exhibiting the relevant HSP.
Several physical processes have been proposed to explain the observed HSP in these solar magnetic
structures (refer to a review by Bao et al. 2002, and references therein). The proposed processes are
thought to play a crucial role in the generation of twist on magnetic ﬂux tubes at the base of the con-
vection zone, during their buoyant rise through the bulk of the convection zone, and by their footpoint
motions in the photosphere, such as: (1) diﬀerential rotation (Seehafer 1990; Berger & Ruzmaikin
2000; DeVore 2000; D´emoulin et al. 2002), (2) Coriolis force (Glatzmaier 1985; Longcope & Klapper
1997; Wang 2013), (3) α-eﬀect involved in turbulent dynamo models (Ruzmaikin 1996; Seehafer
1996; Gilman & Charbonneau 1999; Dikpati & Gilman 2001; Pipin et al. 2013), (4) helical turbu-
lent convection (called Σ-eﬀect; Longcope et al. 1998), and (5) local photospheric ﬂows associated
with magnetic ﬂux cancellation and reconnection (van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Priest et al.
1994; Litvinenko 1999; van Ballegooijen 1999). As discussed in Bao et al. (2002), some of the afore-
mentioned processes need not be mutually exclusive but may simultaneously operate in producing
twist on ﬂux tubes through the layers from the deep convection zone to the photosphere. As a
result, the degree of the HSP may be either strengthened or weakened by multiple combinations
of the processes acting on rising ﬂux tubes. However, the relative importance of these diﬀerent
processes responsible for the HSP is still under debate. It is also not clear what causes variations
in the strength of the HSP, which were observed, for example, in diﬀerent phases of a solar cycle
(Hagino & Sakurai 2005; Gosain & Brandenburg 2019; Komm & Gosain 2019) as well as in diﬀerent
solar features (Pevtsov et al. 2014).

Magnetic helicity is a useful, quantitative measure to diagnose the underlying physical processes
that govern the HSP, in terms of twists, kinks, and inter-linkages of magnetic ﬁeld lines (e.g.,
Berger & Field 1984; Berger & Prior 2006; D´emoulin & Pariat 2009). Here we estimate magnetic he-
licity ﬂux across the photospheric surface of active regions (ARs) over an 8-year span of 2010 through
2017, using photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld observations by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).

Hemispheric Sign Preference of Magnetic Helicity Flux

Analyzing the estimated magnetic helicity ﬂux with a large sample, we intend to (1) quantitatively
investigate the HSP of magnetic helicity ﬂux for diﬀerent groups as categorized by their heliographic
latitudes and phase of the solar cycle, Mount Wilson magnetic classiﬁcations, and relevant magnetic
ﬁeld properties, (2) investigate if there are trends in the strength of the HSP with respect to those
considered categorizations, and (3) support (or not) a preferred condition and relevant mechanism
for adherence to the observed HSP.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. Data Set of Active Region Vector Magnetograms

In this study, we analyze a data set of HMI full-disk photospheric vector magnetograms
(hmi.B 720s) with a spatial resolution of 1′′ (pixel size of 0.5′′) observed at 00:36 and 00:48 TAI each
day from 2010 May 1 to 2017 December 31. For the given HMI data set, we ﬁrst search for auto-
matically identiﬁed HMI AR Patches (HARPs; Hoeksema et al. 2014, as recorded in the hmi.M 720s
series), each of which satisﬁes the following criteria: (1) the HARP boundaries are located within
60◦ in longitude from the central meridian, and (2) only a single NOAA-numbered AR with at
±
least one sunspot visible in white-light is contained in the HARP ﬁeld of view (FOV). Hereafter,
we will refer to such HARPs satisfying our selection criteria as ARs. HARPs containing a single
NOAA-numbered AR but without a sunspot are not considered as ARs, but are categorized instead
as a distinct group, namely old-region plage. Because NOAA assigns numbers only to active regions
containing sunspots, numbered regions without sunspots can uniquely be considered old, decaying
active region remnants. A comparison of the HSP of magnetic helicity ﬂux between ARs and plages
is presented in the Appendix.

The coordinates of each identiﬁed HARP are used to construct cutout images of all three vector
magnetic ﬁeld components from the corresponding full-disk vector magnetic ﬁeld data, using the
NWRA remote-SUMS/DRMS system. Over the examined period of 2010 to 2017, consequently,
we obtain a total of 4,802 co-aligned pairs of AR vector magnetograms with time separation of 12
minutes, which we consider 4,802 samples. Given the deﬁnition above, this amounts to 1,105 unique
NOAA numbers. While many ARs are thus sampled repeatedly with a 24 hr cadence, we consider
these samples independent because magnetic helicity ﬂux estimates can show signiﬁcant variations,
including sign changes, over timescales of 24 hr and longer (Park et al. 2008, 2010; Liu & Schuck
2012; Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017; Bi et al. 2018). For each HARP in our data set, we examined
the fraction of magnetic helicity ﬂux measurements that are opposite that HARP’s majority sign over
the observing time between the longitude limits imposed. Upon examination, the fraction is found
to be 0.17, on average, for all HARPs studied here. Such observed sign changes could be caused
by diﬀerence processes such as emerging magnetic ﬂux with an opposite sign of magnetic helicity
into the corona, submerging magnetic ﬂux into the interior that brings magnetic helicity across the
surface, and photospheric ﬂows that unwind twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines. Of note, because we are
sampling the HMI data at the same time each day, variations in the magnetic helicity ﬂux are likely
not due to the inﬂuence of the spacecraft orbital velocity (Liu & Schuck 2012; Schuck et al. 2016).
Figure 1 shows the frequency distributions of (a–c) center coordinates, and (d) observed years of all
identiﬁed HARPs at 00:36 TAI. All the co-aligned AR vector magnetogram pairs are remapped from
pixel coordinates in the original CCD image plane to helioplanar coordinates (here, denoted as Bx,
By and Bz). The x-axis and y-axis are oriented toward solar west and north, respectively, on a plane

2.2. Estimation of Photospheric Magnetic Helicity Flux

Photospheric plasma velocity ﬁelds (i.e., vx, vy and vz) in ARs are derived from the co-aligned pairs
of Bx, By and Bz images at 12-minute separation with the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator for
Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008). The apodization window size used in DAVE4VM
is set to 13 pixels, based on the same evaluation test performed by Schuck (2008), but for the pairs
of HMI Bx, By and Bz images in our case.

With the AR photospheric magnetic and velocity ﬁelds, we calculate the net magnetic helicity
transfer rate dH/dt, also known as magnetic helicity ﬂux, across the entire photospheric surface S
(i.e., the HARP FOV) of each AR

where the subscript “h” represents the horizontal components of photospheric vector ﬁelds. It should
be noted that the surface integrals in Equations (1) and (2) are carried out only for high-conﬁdence
pixels (as indicated by a value of 90 in the conf disambig.fits segment; see (Hoeksema et al.
2014)). Throughout this paper for notational simplicity, magnetic helicity refers to gauge-invariant
relative magnetic helicity (Berger & Field 1984; Finn & Antonsen 1985) with the speciﬁc choice of
the Coulomb gauge for the vector potential of the potential ﬁeld. dH/dt reﬂects only magnetic
helicity ﬂux across the photosphere for a region of interest, such as would be caused by magnetic
helicity transport due to emerging/submerging twisted magnetic ﬂux tubes or photospheric footpoint
motions. The estimated dH/dt in this study therefore does not necessarily represent the HSP of the
overall magnetic helicity content in the full coronal volume above said region of interest.

2.3. Uncertainties in Magnetic Helicity Flux Estimates

The uncertainty in the calculation of dH/dt is estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation as follows.
(1) To each data point in a co-aligned pair of 12-minute-separated Bx, By and Bz maps of a given AR,
we add a noise value randomly taken from a Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation cor-
responding to the uncertainty in each component of the magnetic ﬁeld vector as propagated from the
reported “error” segments provided from the Milne-Eddington inversion of the HMI Stokes proﬁles
(Hoeksema et al. 2014), assuming the disambiguation is perfect. (2) vx, vy and vz are determined,
applying the DAVE4VM method to the pair of Bx, By and Bz with random Gaussian noise added.
(3) dH/dt is estimated from Equations (1)–(3).
(4) The procedure of (1) to (3) is repeated 100
times so that the mean (<dH/dt>) and standard deviation (σdH/dt) values of dH/dt are determined.

With dH/dt determined for each of 4,802 photospheric vector magnetogram pairs, we examine the

the HSP of α between the diﬀerent Mount Wilson classiﬁcations was not statistically signiﬁcant due
to the small sample size.

We now investigate any dependence of the HSP of dH/dt on broad properties of ARs. Figure 4

70 – 80% for AR samples appearing at an earlier date of the examined period, or a higher
up to
latitude. This implies that ARs in the inclining phase of solar cycle 24 are more likely to comply with
the HSP than those in the declining phase. The observed dependence of the HSP on the solar cycle
phase was also found by other studies (e.g., Hagino & Sakurai 2005; Gao et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2014;
Pipin et al. 2019) in which the HSP was evaluated with diﬀerent measures of magnetic twist such
as the force-free parameter α and vertical current helicity density. In the case of Hagino & Sakurai
(2005), we draw particular attention to the years categorized as activity minimum and maximum
periods of solar cycles 21–23 in their study, and found that the activity minimum period mostly
consists of the late declining phase of the solar cycles (i.e., several years after the sunspot maximum),
while the maximum period contains the early inclining phase. We note that our study quantitatively
shows the HSP of dH/dt as a function of date and latitude, for the ﬁrst time, from the inclining to
declining phases of solar cycle 24. In addition, a weak tendency is found that ARs with larger values

stronger magnetic ﬁelds has been reported by Maurya & Ambastha (2020) in which they examined
α, vertical current helicity density, and kinetic helicity density parameters from measurements of
photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and near surface sub-photospheric ﬂow ﬁelds in 189 ARs observed during
the descending phase of the solar cycle 23. Investigating current helicity density derived from synoptic
maps of the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld, Zhang (2006) and Gosain et al. (2013) also reported
that strong-ﬁeld (Bz > 1000 G) regions show a higher degree of the HSP as compared to weak-ﬁeld
(100 G < Bz < 500 G) regions. Finally, as expected, the HSP compliance of dH/dt is lower for ARs
for which the sign of <α> is positive/negative in the northern/southern hemisphere, (i.e., opposite
to that expected from the HSP, and conﬁrming the correlation between dH/dt and <α>).

3.2. Interpretations

∼

We oﬀer some interpretations of our observational ﬁndings on the HSP dependence of dH/dt with
respect to various properties of ARs. Before interpreting the HSP dependence, we remind the reader
that solar dynamo models need to reproduce these observed HSP dependencies as well as the degree
of overall conforming to the HSP at the

60% level as shown in Figure 3.

First, an enhancement of the HSP can be made by the Coriolis force (including the small-scale Σ-
eﬀect) acting on a buoyantly rising and expanding ﬂux tube through the turbulent convection zone,
as it generates the twist of magnetic ﬁeld lines inside the ﬂux tube which has a sign agreeing with the
HSP. The twist will be more eﬀectively induced by the Coriolis force in cases where a ﬂux tube (1)
rises through the bulk of the convection zone at a higher latitude; (2) has larger magnetic ﬂux so that
both the rising speed and expansion of the ﬂux tube are faster due to larger magnetic buoyancy and
pressure. This scenario of the HSP enhancement is in good agreement with our observational ﬁndings

On the other hand, the Coriolis force acting on the photospheric footpoints of an emerged ﬂux
tube will produce positive/negative magnetic helicity in the northern/southern hemisphere (i.e., a

negative contribution to the HSP). The observed dependencies of the HSP on heliographic latitude
and <
>, however, suggest that this action of the Coriolis force may be relatively weak compared
|
|
to other sources of the HSP.

v

Another important process that can generate and modify twist on ﬂux tubes is diﬀerential rotation.
A negative contribution to the HSP will be made in the convection zone by a shearing action of
diﬀerential rotation on a rising Ω-shaped ﬂux tube with a tilt between its leading and following legs
of opposite polarities. This suggests that a ﬂux tube rising through a localized region of the convection
zone with a larger degree of diﬀerential rotation may have an opposite sign of magnetic helicity as
compared to the one expected from the HSP. In the global-scale three-dimensional convective dynamo
simulations by Fan & Fang (2014, 2016), it is found that the presence of strong, large-scale magnetic
ﬁelds at the base of the convection zone results in a more enhanced outward Reynolds stress and
consequently a larger diﬀerential rotation. Moreover, the diﬀerential rotation in the convection zone
is found to be larger at a higher latitude in both simulations and helioseismic observations (see a
review by Howe 2009, and references therein). In contrast to the above-mentioned possible ways of
weakening the HSP by the diﬀerential rotation, our results, however, show an increasing trend of the
HSP of dH/dt with Φ, as well as with latitude, which implies that the HSP may be less impacted
by the diﬀerential rotation in the convection zone. Contrary to the shearing action of diﬀerential
rotation in the convection zone, the photospheric diﬀerential rotation on the solar surface will lead to
the enhancement of the HSP, twisting the footpoints of emerged magnetic ﬁelds and shearing a bipolar
sunspot pair of an emerged Ω-shaped ﬂux tube. The observed increase of the HSP of dH/dt with
increasing latitude supports the scenario that the HSP is strengthened by a larger surface diﬀerential
rotation observed at a higher latitude (Shi & Xie 2014; Lamb 2017).

Meanwhile, the tachocline α-eﬀect of ﬂux-transport dynamos (e.g., Gilman & Charbonneau 1999;
Dikpati & Gilman 2001) at the base of the convection zone will generate a twisted ﬂux tube of which
helicity sign follows the HSP. It is shown that the relative amplitude of the tachocline α-eﬀect in the
30◦–50◦ is much larger than that at lower latitudes. Consequently, a higher HSP
latitude range of
is expected at higher latitudes, which is supported by the observed positive correlation between the
HSP of dH/dt and latitude.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Magnetic helicity is a useful, quantitative measure to examine the handedness of twisted magnetic
ﬁeld lines observed in various magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere. In this paper we have
investigated magnetic helicity ﬂux (dH/dt) across the photospheric surface for 4,802 samples of 1,105
unique active regions that appeared over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017 of solar cycle 24. Through
the analysis of the AR magnetic helicity ﬂux estimates, we found that 63% and 65% of the samples in
the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, follow the hemispheric sign preference (HSP):
i.e., displaying predominantly the left-handed/right-handed sign of dH/dt in the northern/southern
50 – 60% up to
hemisphere.
70 – 80% in cases where the ARs (1) appeared during the inclining phase of the solar cycle, or at
∼
dH/dt
higher latitudes; (2) had larger values of
, the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, or the average
|
plasma-ﬂow speed; (3) displayed the same sign between the average force-free parameter and that
expected from the HSP (i.e., negative/positive in the northern/southern hemisphere).

It is also found that the HSP compliance of dH/dt increases from

∼

|

All of these observational ﬁndings lend support to the scenario that the HSP of dH/dt is enhanced
primarily by the Coriolis force acting on a buoyantly rising and expanding ﬂux tube through the

turbulent convection zone. In addition, the action of diﬀerential rotation on the solar surface as well
as the tachocline α-eﬀect of ﬂux-transport dynamos may also reinforce the HSP for ARs observed at
higher latitudes. Meanwhile, the observed HSP tendencies imply that an expected weakening of the
HSP by the diﬀerential rotation in the convection zone is less signiﬁcant compared to the enhancement
of the HSP by the Coriolis force in the convection zone, the photospheric diﬀerential rotation, and/or
the tachocline α-eﬀect. We urge research that employs state-of-the-art solar convective dynamo
simulations to explore and use as model validation the trends put forth here, in order to judge the
relative input of relevant processes to helicity transport throughout the solar cycle.

APPENDIX: COMPARISON OF THE HEMISPHERIC HELICITY SIGN PREFERENCE
BETWEEN ACTIVE REGIONS AND PLAGE REGIONS

Plage regions are observed as bright areas in Hα line center images without a dark sunspot in
the continuum.
In particular with the dataset considered here, plage regions may be assumed to
be aged regions with decaying magnetic ﬁelds. In this section we investigate whether there is any
diﬀerence of the HSP of dH/dt between ARs and plages. For this, we ﬁrst searched HARPs over the
8 years (i.e., 2010 May 1 to 2017 December 31), each of which con-
same investigated period of

NOAA-identiﬁed plage areas, speciﬁcally 795 and 661 samples in the northern and southern hemi-
spheres, respectively. Figures 6 and 7 show the HSP of dH/dt for plage samples (black circles with
error bars) as a function of the region properties described in Figures 4 and 5, with the HSP of dH/dt
for ARs (red diamonds) also shown for reference. We ﬁnd that ARs and plages exhibit similar overall
trends in the strength of the HSP of dH/dt with respect to the properties considered (explained in
detail in Section 3.1). Even though some diﬀerences are found in the HSP trends between ARs and
