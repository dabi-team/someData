ABSTRACT
Previous X-ray spectral analysis has revealed an increasing number of AGNs with
high accretion rates where an outﬂow with a mildly relativistic velocity originates
from the inner accretion disk. Here we report the detection of a new ultra-fast outﬂow
(UFO) with a velocity of vout = 0.319+0.005
−0.008c in addition to a relativistic disk reﬂection
component in a poorly studied NLS1 WKK 4438, based on archival NuSTAR and
Suzaku observations. The spectra of both Suzaku and NuSTAR observations show an
Fe xxvi absorption feature and the Suzaku data also show evidence for an Ar xviii
with the same blueshift. A super-solar argon abundance (Z(cid:48)
Ar > 6Z(cid:12)) and a slight
iron over-abundance (Z(cid:48)
−2.0Z(cid:12)) are found in our spectral modelling. Based on
Monte-Carlo simulations, the detection of the UFO is estimated to be around at 3σ
signiﬁcance. The fast wind most likely arises from a radius of ≥ 20rg away from the
central black hole. The disk is accreting at a high Eddington ratio (Lbol = 0.4−0.7LEdd).
The mass outﬂow rate of the UFO is comparable with the disk mass inﬂow rate
( ˙Mout > 30% ˙Min), assuming a maximum covering factor. The kinetic power of the wind
might not be high enough to have inﬂuence in AGN feedback ( ˙Ewind/Lbol ≈ 3 − 5%)
due to a relatively small column density (12+9
−4 × 1022 cm−2). However note that both
the inferred velocity and the column density could be lower limits owing to the low
viewing angle (i = 23+3

Fe = 2.6+1.9

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently there has been increasing evidence showing the
presence of absorption line features above 7 keV in the X-
ray band of various sources, including Active Galactic Nu-
clei (AGNs) (e.g. Chartas et al. 2002, 2003; Cappi 2006;
Tombesi et al. 2010, 2014; Tombesi 2016). These absorption
line features are commonly interpreted as blueshifted Fe xxv
or Fe xxvi K absorption in a highly ionized environment
(log(ξ /erg cm s−1)>3) and can occasionally correspond to a
very large line-of-sight outﬂow velocity of up to 0.2 − 0.4c
(e.g. Tombesi et al. 2010). Such outﬂows are often referred
to as ultra-fast outﬂows (UFOs), and lie in the mildly rela-
tivistic regime indicating that the outﬂow is driven from the
inner accretion disk.

c(cid:13) 2018 The Authors

There are two key technical challenges when it comes
to searching for ultra-fast outﬂows. The ﬁrst is that they are
close to the upper limit of the instrumental eﬀective area of
most soft energy cameras, such as Suzaku XIS and XMM-
Newton EPIC. Elements lighter than iron are generally fully
ionized and therefore show weak or absent absorption fea-
tures in the soft energy band. Only strong iron absorption
feature remains above 7 keV where the signal-to-noise (S/N)
and the spectral resolution are worse than in the soft band.
The second is that the broadband continuum needs to be
correctly modeled in order robustly determine the key ab-
sorption parameters (e.g. Zoghbi et al. 2015). This is partic-
ularly critical for AGN sources, which often exhibit complex
X-ray spectra with strong reﬂection.

One popular theory for the origin of these extreme out-
ﬂows is that the radiation pressure due to a high accretion
rate drives the UFO (e.g. PDS 456; Matzeu et al. 2017).

J. Jiang et al.

It is therefore interesting to note the discovery of UFOs in
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs; e.g. Pinto et al. 2016;
Walton et al. 2016; Kosec et al. 2018), which appear to be
sources accreting above their Eddington limit. Another ideal
population to test this theory are Narrow Line Seyfert 1
(NLS1) galaxies. NLS1s are characterized by having low-
mass, high-accretion-rate black holes in the center. For ex-
ample, IRAS 13224−3809 accretes around the Eddington
limit and shows a ﬂux-dependent blueshifted Fe absorption
feature above 8 keV (e.g. Parker et al. 2017b; Parker et al.
2017a; Pinto et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018) which is inter-
preted as a UFO with velocity up to 0.236 ± 0.006c.

WKK 4438 is a nearby (z=0.016) NLS1 galaxy host-
ing a low-mass supermassive black hole MBH = 2 × 106M(cid:12)
(measured by the Hβ line width in the optical band, Mal-
izia et al. 2008). In this work, we analyse its archival X-ray
spectra obtained by Suzaku and NuSTAR satellites, which
show blueshifted Fe xxvi and Ar xviii absorption lines in
addition to a relativistic reﬂection component.

2 DATA REDUCTION

WKK 4438 has not been studied well in the X-ray band. The
only long soft band observation is one 70 ks Suzaku obser-
vation (obsID 703011010), taken in 2012. The only archival
NuSTAR observation (obsID 60061259002) is a 20 ks snap-
shot in 2013.

2.1 Suzaku Data Reduction

We reduced the Suzaku data with the latest HEASOFT soft-
ware package. We processed the raw event ﬁles for each
XIS CCD and created ﬁltered event lists for XIS0, XIS1
and XIS3 detectors by running the Suzaku pipeline. The
CALDB version we use for XIS detectors is 20160607. XS-
ELECT was used to extract the spectral products. The size
of the circular region we used to extract the source regions
is 3.5(cid:48) in radius and the background regions were selected
from the surrounding areas free from the target source and
the calibration source. XISRESP was used to generate the
corresponding response ﬁles with ‘medium’ resolution. The
spectra and the response ﬁles of the front-illuminated CCDs
(XIS0 and XIS3) were combined by using ADDSPEC. We
grouped the spectra to have a minimum count of 50 per bin
with GRPPHA. Hereafter, the combined spectrum of the
front-illuminated CCD XIS0 and XIS3 is called FI spectrum
(blue in ﬁgures) and the spectrum of the back-illuminated
CCD XIS1 is called BI spectrum (green in ﬁgures). We anal-
ysed the FI and BI data over the 0.7–10 keV and 0.7–9 keV
energy range, respectively. The 1.7–2.5 keV band is ignored
in both spectra due to calibration issues around the Si K
edge 1.

2.2 NuSTAR Data Reduction

The NuSTAR data were reduced using the NuSTAR
data analysis software NuSTARDAS and CALDB version
20161021. In addition to the standard science (mode 1) event

1 https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/analysis/sical.html

ﬁles, we also extracted the products from the spacecraft sci-
ence (mode 6) event ﬁles by following Walton et al. (2016) to
maximize the exposure of the observation and thus increase
the S/N of our FPM spectra. The mode 6 events contribute
an additional 4 ks good exposure in addition to the mode 1
events. The total net exposure is 26 ks. The source spectra
were selected from circular regions with radii of 60(cid:48)(cid:48), and the
background was obtained from nearby circular regions with
radii of 120(cid:48)(cid:48). Spectra were extracted from the cleaned event
ﬁles using NUPRODUCTS for both FPMA and FPMB. The
FPMA and FPMB spectra were grouped to have a minimum
count of 50 per bin by using GRPPHA. The 3.0–50.0 keV
band is considered as the background spectrum dominates
above 50 keV. Two spectra were analysed independently but
we only show the combined spectrum in our plots (in red)
for clarity.

3 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

For the spectral analysis, we use the XSPEC(12.9.1k) soft-
ware package (Arnaud 1996) to ﬁt all the spectra discussed,
and χ 2-statistics is considered in this work. The Galactic
column density towards WKK 4438 is ﬁxed at the nominal
value 4.3 × 1021 cm−2 (Willingale et al. 2013) if not speciﬁed.
The parameter values are reported in the source rest frame.
The tbnew model (Wilms et al. 2000) is used for calculating
the Galactic absorption. The solar abundance is taken from
Wilms et al. (2000). The cross section is taken from Verner
et al. (1996).

3.1 Spectral Modelling

−0.12 keV and 0.31+0.34

First, we ﬁtted the Suzaku and NuSTAR spectra indepen-
dently with a Galactic absorbed powerlaw model. The top
panel of Fig. 1 shows the ratio plot against the best-ﬁt pow-
erlaw model (Γ = 2.00, 1.76 for Suzaku and NuSTAR respec-
tively). An Fe Kα emission line feature in two sets of spectra
and a Compton hump above 15 keV in the FPM spectra in-
dicate a strong reﬂection component. By ﬁtting the emission
feature at the iron band with a simple zgauss line model,
it improves the ﬁt by ∆χ 2 = 71. The best-ﬁt line width (σ )
values are 0.41+0.13
−0.16 keV for XIS and FPM
spectra respectively, indicating a broad Fe emission line in
both two sets of spectra. Both lines are broader than the
instrument energy resolution. The rest frame energy of the
zgauss line model is 6.3 ± 0.1 keV for the XIS spectra and
6.3+0.2
−0.3 keV for the FPM spectra. A broad absorption line
feature is visible around 10 keV in the FPM spectra. The FI
spectrum also shows some evidence of a broad absorption
line feature at 10 keV but it lies too close to the upper limit
of the observable energy range. A second absorption line fea-
ture is visible at ≈ 4.6 keV in both the Suzaku FI and BI
spectra (see Fig. 2). As far as we know, there is no obvious
calibration issue during this Suzaku observation (Yukikatsu
Terada, Katja Pottschmidt priv. comm.). All three cameras
of the Suzaku satellite show consistent absorption features
at 4.6 keV (see Fig.2).

Second, we ﬁtted both the NuSTAR and Suzaku spectra
with the relativistic disk reﬂection model relxilllp (Gar-
c´ıa et al. 2014). This model calculates consistent emissivity
proﬁle for the relativistic blurred disk iron line according to

the coronal height in the lamp-post scenario. The spin pa-
rameter is ﬁxed at its maximum value 0.998 and the inner
radius of the disk is allowed to vary. The disk inner radius
Rin, viewing angle i and the disk iron abundance ZFe are
linked between two epochs. relxilllp gives a best-ﬁt with
χ 2/ν = 1396.4/1438, where ν is the number of the degrees of
freedom. The relativistic blurred disk reﬂection model can
ﬁt the soft excess below 1 keV, the emission line at the
iron band, and the Compton hump. It improves the ﬁt by
∆χ 2 = 533 compared to the simple powerlaw+zgauss mod-
elling. However, the broad absorption line features at 10 keV
and 4.6 keV are still visible in the ratio plot (see the middle
panel of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for absorption lines).

Based on the best-ﬁt relxilllp model, we ﬁtted the
absorption features with two simple line models zgauss. The
redshift parameter z is ﬁxed at the source redshift and the
line energy is allowed to vary to obtain the line position
in the source rest frame. The line parameters except the
normalization are all linked between two observations. The
inclusion of two zgauss models can improve the χ 2 by 33
with additional 8 free parameters (∆χ 2 = 16 for the 4.6 keV
absorption line and ∆χ 2 = 17 for the 10 keV absorption line).
The other parameters can be found in Tab.1.

3.1.1 Fast wind modelling

In this section, we model the two absorption features with
one ionized fast wind absorber.

If the absorption line at 10 keV is interpreted as the
Fe xxvi Lyα line (6.97 keV), it corresponds to a redshift
value of zFe = −0.28+0.03
−0.04. If the absorption line at 4.6 keV
is interpreted as the Ar xviii Lyα line (3.32 keV), it cor-
responds to a redshift value of zAr = −0.281+0.005
−0.004. The two
redshift values are consistent within the uncertainty, corre-
sponding to a relativistic outﬂow with a velocity of v ≈ 0.3c.
Finally, we modelled the absorption features in both the
NuSTAR and Suzaku spectra with the same photoionized
absorption model xstar (Kallman & Bautista 2001). The
warmabs model, the alternative analytical version of xstar,
is used ﬁrst to estimate the line width of the absorption
lines. We ﬁtted with the turbulent velocity as a free param-
eter and obtained a best-ﬁt value of vtur > 6000 km s−1 at the
2σ conﬁdence level. Then we constructed custom absorption
models with xstar. The grids are calculated assuming solar
abundances except for that of iron and argon, a ﬁxed tur-
bulent velocity of 6000 km s−1 and an ionizing luminosity of
1043 erg s−1. Free parameters are the ionization of the plasma
(log ξ (cid:48)), the column density (N(cid:48)
Fe),
the argon abundance (Z(cid:48)
Ar) and the redshift (z). The prime
symbol is to distinguish the parameter of the outﬂow from
that of the disk. The iron and argon abundances of the UFO
(Z(cid:48)
Ar,Fe) are treated as independent free parameters during

H), the iron abundance (Z(cid:48)

our ﬁt. The total model reads tbnew*xstar*relxilllp in
XSPEC format.

The best-ﬁt model parameters obtained by ﬁtting the
two sets of spectra with tbnew*xstar*relxilllp can be
found in Table 2. The ratio plot can be found in the bottom
panel of Fig.1. One xstar model with a turbulent velocity of
vtur = 6000 km s−1 can ﬁt two absorption lines well simultane-
ously and improve the ﬁt by ∆χ 2 = 33 with additional 5 free
parameters after stepping the redshift parameter z between
-0.35 and 0 with 70 steps with all the other parameters free
to vary. See the left panel of Fig.3 for the constraint on the
redshift parameter z. The STEPPAR function in XSPEC is
used for the stepping purpose. The best-ﬁt xstar model is
shown in the bottom panel of Fig.3.

3.1.2 Alternative scenarios for the absorptions

In this section, we test other possible solutions for the two
absorption features.

First, an alternative interpretation of the 10 keV ab-
sorption feature is the Fe K edge from a slower wind. We ﬁt-
ted the 10 keV absorption line with a simple edge absorption
model zedge and obtained an improved ﬁt with ∆χ 2 = 7.4.
The edge model provides a worse ﬁt of the 10 keV absorp-
tion feature than the line absorption model (∆χ 2 = 17, see
Table 1). Therefore, we exclude the edge interpretation of
the 10 keV absorption feature.

Second, an alternative identiﬁcation of the 4.6 keV ab-
sorption feature could be a blueshifted Ca xx absorption
line, with a lower blueshift value compared to the Ar xviii
interpretation. The rest frame energy of the dominant Ca xx
Lyα1 absorption line is around 4.11 keV. A very high rel-
ativistic outﬂowing velocity of v = 0.166+0.008
−0.009c is still re-
quired in addition to a fast wind component obtained in Sec-
tion 3.1.1. In this case, a highly super-solar Ca abundance
(Z(cid:48)
Ca > 70Z(cid:12)) is required to ﬁt the 4.6 keV line, given the
lack of the other absorption lines. So although the fast wind
model does require an unusual Ar abundance, the slower
wind model requires an even more extreme abundance ra-
tio.

Third, we explored the possibility of a warm absorber
solution for the 4.6 keV absorption feature by limiting the
velocity of the warmabs absorber within v<1000 km s−1 and
assuming solar abundances. Warm absorbers are partially
ionzied, optically thin, circumnuclear materials causing a
series of absorption features (e.g. McKernan et al. 2007)
and are not uncommn among nearby AGNs (Reynolds 1997;
George et al. 1998; Laha et al. 2014). However, the addi-
tional warmabs model fails to improve the ﬁt of the 4.6 keV
absorption line. Because no strong absorption lines of other
elements are produced around 4.6 keV at an ionization state
of log(ξ ) = 0 − 4 without any other absorption features be-
ing produced simultaneously. For example, if the 4.6 keV
absorption line is interpreted as the Ca xix absorption line
at 4.58 keV at an ionization state of log(ξ ) = 2, a stronger
Ca xiv absorption line at 3.76 keV with an optical depth
1000 times larger than Ca xix is expected at the same ion-
ization state but not detected in the spectra.

Fourth, another possible origin of the 4.6 keV line fea-
ture is the Fe xxv/xxvi absorption from a relativistic inﬂow
(e.g. Mrk 509 Dadina et al. 2005). An inﬂowing velocity of
0.38c and 0.35c is required if the absorption feature corre-

of the NuSTAR observation is (5.15 ± 0.08) × 10−12erg cm−2 s−1.

sponds to the Fe xxv and Fe xxvi line respectively. However,
absorption features from an inﬂow with such a high velocity
(> 0.35c) have not been conﬁrmed in other sources.

In conclusion, we argue that the fast wind model that
can account for both the 4.6 keV and 10 keV absorption
features simultaneously is preferred.

powerlaw (top), relxilllp (middle) and xstar*relxilllp model

Only FI spectrum is shown here. FPMA and FPMB are ﬁtted in-
dependently and the combined spectrum is shown only for clarity.
All the spectra show a fairly broad Fe Kα emission line at the iron
band. A Compton hump is shown above 15 keV. The NuSTAR
spectra show a broad absorption line feature around 10 keV in
the rest frame which is consistent with the Suzaku FI spectrum.

3.2 Spectral Analysis Results

According to the best-ﬁt reﬂection model, the disk is trun-
cated with an inner radius of Rin = 15+8
−5rg. The disk viewing
angle is well constrained at i = 23+3
◦ with respect to the
−2
normal direction of the disk. An additional distant reﬂec-
tion model xillver with the abundance linked to the disk
reﬂection component only improves the ﬁt by ∆χ 2 = 4 and
gives a disk viewing angle of i = 24+4

The absorber model xstar prefers the Fe xxvi interpre-
tation of the broad absorption line at 10 keV, as it can ﬁt the
absorption lines at 4.6 keV and 10 keV simultaneously (see
the left panel of Fig.3). The outﬂow has a column density of
H = 12+9
N(cid:48)
−4 × 1022 cm−3, an ionization of log(ξ (cid:48)/erg cm s−1) =

−0.3 and a redshift of z = −0.270 ± 0.006, corresponding to
a line-of-sight outﬂowing velocity v = −0.319+0.005
−0.008c account-
ing for the relativistic corrections and the cosmological red-
shift of WKK 4438. When the UFO argon abundance Z(cid:48)
Ar
and iron abundance Z(cid:48)
Fe are treated as independent free pa-
rameters, a lower limit on the argon abundance is obtained
(Z(cid:48)
Ar > 6) and a slight iron over-abundance is required com-
pared to solar (Z(cid:48)
−2.0). Note that the abundances are
probably degenerate with the column density. More discus-
sion about the uncommon argon abundance can be found in
Section 5.

4 MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS

In this section, we present our estimation on signiﬁcance of
the outﬂow detection in the current archival data based on
Monte-Carlo simulations.

We simulated 7000 sets of Suzaku (FI and BI) and NuS-
TAR (FPMA and FPMB) spectra using the best-ﬁt relx-
illlp model discussed in Section 3. The same exposures
and the ﬂux levels as the real observations are considered.
The key reﬂection model parameters used are the best-ﬁt
values obtained for the relxilllp-only model in Section 3.1

and an outﬂowing velocity of vout = 0.319+0.005
−0.008c. The UFO
absorption features are consistent when ﬁtting the contin-
uum only with the distant reﬂection model xillver. The
inferred line signiﬁcance is however higher with a distant re-
ﬂection modelling. We discuss the physics properties of the
outﬂow, other systematic uncertainties of the measurements,
and future work in this section.

To calculate the disk accretion rate, we apply an aver-
age bolometric correction factor κ = 20 (Vasudevan & Fabian
2007) to the 2–10 keV ﬂux in the Suzaku and NuSTAR ob-
servation. The bolometric luminosity of WKK 4438 is es-
timated to be Lbol = 1.6 − 2.8 × 1044 erg s−1 = 0.4 − 0.7LEdd,
assuming MBH = 2 × 106 M(cid:12) (Malizia et al. 2008). A com-
bination of high accretion rate and UFO is seen in other
sources, such as rapidly accreting AGNs with high accre-
tion rate (e.g. IRAS 13224−3809: Parker et al. (2017b);
Parker et al. (2017a); Pinto et al. (2018); 1H0707−495:
Dauser et al. (2012); PDS 456 Nardini et al. (2015); Reeves
et al. (2018b); PG 1211+143: Fukumura et al. (2015); Reeves
et al. (2018a)), and ULXs (Pinto et al. 2016; Walton et al.
2016; Kosec et al. 2018). The Eddington accretion rate for
a black hole of MBH = 2 × 106 M(cid:12) is 9 × 1020 kg s−1. There-
fore the mass accretion rate of WKK 4438 is ˙Min ≈ 0.006 −
0.01M(cid:12) yr−1.

We estimate the mass outﬂow rate by following Tombesi
et al. (2017). A lower limit on the location of the wind
out ≈ 5.8 × 1010 m, which
can be derived from r = 2GMBH/v2
means that the wind is launched at r ≥ 20rg away from
the central SMBH. The mass outﬂow rate of the wind is
˙Mout = 4π µmprNHCFvout, where µ = 1.4 is the average atomic
mass per proton, CF is the covering factor of the wind, and
mp is the proton mass. Therefore, the lower limit on the
˙Mout ≈ 0.003CFM(cid:12)yr−1. The covering
mass outﬂow rate is
factor CF of the wind remains unknown. The mass outﬂow
rate is comparable with the mass accretion rate, assuming
a maximum covering factor (CF ≈ 1 for PDS 456 (Nardini
et al. 2015) and IRAS F11119+3257 (Tombesi et al. 2015)).
The kinetic power of the wind is then ˙Ewind = (1/2) ˙Moutv2
out ≈
9.59 × 1042 erg s−1 ≈ 3 − 5%Lbol, assuming maximum cover-
ing factor. The low ˙Ewind/Lbol ratio is due to a small column
density of the wind and indicates the energetics might not
be high enough to have an inﬂuence in AGN feedback (e.g.
Di Matteo et al. 2005). However, note that both the inferred
velocity and the column density could be lower limits owing
to the low inclination we infer, assuming the wind still has
a roughly equatorial geometry.

Ar/Z(cid:48)

In order to understand the high argon abundance re-
quired by the best-ﬁt spectral model, we ﬁrst investigated
relative argon abundance against several other elements,
such as silicon, sulfur, calcium, iron and oxygen, by ﬁtting
the spectra with the warmabs model. It turns out that the
spectral ﬁtting requires a high Z(cid:48)
Fe > 4.2 in the outﬂow.
When the UFO and disk iron abundances are linked dur-
ing the ﬁt (Z(cid:48)
Fe = ZFe), a solar iron abundance is required
(Z(cid:48)
−0.18Z(cid:12)) with χ 2 = 1364.1, slightly worse
than the ﬁt with Z(cid:48)
Fe and ZFe both as a free parameter. The
other parameter values do not change too much when the
two iron abundances are linked. Second, we also tried ﬁtting
the data with a single matallicity (Z(cid:48)), with the abundance
of all elements heavier than He linked together. It oﬀers a
metallicity value of Z(cid:48) > 0.6Z(cid:12) with χ 2 = 1388.4. Finally, if
we allow for a free iron abundance in addition to a single

Fe = ZFe = 0.96+0.66

(h=5.06 rg, i = 23◦, Rin = 16rg, and ZFe = 0.91). The reﬂec-
tion fraction is Rreﬂ = 1.52 for the Suzaku simulations and
Rreﬂ = 2.38 for NuSTAR simulations. The powerlaw contin-
uum has a photon index of Γ = 2.05 for Suzaku simula-
tions and Γ = 1.99 for NuSTAR simulations. The fakeit
command is used to simulate the spectra. All the spectra
are grouped to have a minimum count of 50 per bin using
GRPPHA. We analysed each set of simulated spectra with
both relxilllp and xstar*relxilllp models and measure
the distribution of the statistical improvements achieved by
adding the xstar absorber. All the parameters in Table 2
are free to vary during our spectral ﬁtting processes. We
conducted a search for any absorption features in each set
of simulated spectra by stepping the redshift parameter z
of the xstar model in the same way as in the real spectral
analysis.

The inclusion of the xstar model improves the ﬁt statis-
tic by ∆χ 2 = 33.1 in the real spectral analysis. The ﬁt im-
provements in 17 out of the 7000 simulations exceed this
threshold (a chance probability of 0.024), which means our
detection of UFO in the current data is slightly higher than
3σ signiﬁcance by combining two observations.

5 DISCUSSION

Archival Suzaku and NuSTAR data have revealed the NLS1
WKK 4438 shows evidence for both relativistic disk reﬂec-
tion and an ultra-fast outﬂow. The best-ﬁt UFO parameters
H = 12+9
−4 × 1022 cm−2, an ioniza-
are a column density of N(cid:48)
tion state of log(ξ (cid:48)/erg cm s−1) = 3.9+0.4
−0.3, a slight iron over-
abundance (2.6+1.9
−2.0Z(cid:12)), an argon over-abundance (>6Z(cid:12)),

metallicity for the rest of the heavy elements, we obtained
a ﬁt with χ 2 = 1381.2 (Z(cid:48)
Fe < 3Z(cid:12) and Z(cid:48) > 0.6Z(cid:12)) and only
the 10 keV absorption feature being ﬁtted.

We note that Tombesi et al. (2010) report a similar sce-
nario, where absorption from iron and argon with a common
blueshift, and no other lines detected, for the Seyfert galaxy
NGC 7582. Dauser et al. (2012) analysed the 1H0707-495
XMM-Newton spectra and found a possible P Cygni pro-
ﬁle of H-like Ar in the 2008 observations, where the redshift
of the Ar line feature is however diﬀerent from other ab-
sorption lines. In contrast, another NLS1 IRAS 13224−3809
shows a series of absorption lines in the middle energy band,
including Ne x, S xvi and Si xiv absorption lines, but
shows no evidence of Ar xviii absorption line in the spectra
(Jiang et al. 2018). Although, the variability spectrum of
IRAS 13224−3809 shows some evidence of Ar xviii feature
(Parker et al. 2017a).

By ﬁtting the spectra with the relativistic reﬂection
model relxilllp, we obtain a disk viewing angle of i =
23+3
◦. Such a small viewing angle is unusual for a source
−2
with visible UFO absorption features due to the opening
angle of the wind. Other sources where UFO is detected
show evidence of large disk viewing angle when being ﬁtted
with relativistic disk reﬂection model, such as 1H0707−495
(i ≈ 50◦, Dauser et al. 2012), PDS 456 (i = 65 ± 2◦, Chiang
et al. 2017), IRAS 13224−3809 (i = 67±3◦, Jiang et al. 2018).
An alternative explanation of the absorption features is ion-
ized materials corotating above the disk, where the relativis-
tic velocities occur naturally (Gallo & Fabian 2011). Such a
model has been successfully applied to PG 1211+143 (Gallo
et al. 2013) and IRAS 13224−3809 (Fabian et al. in prep).
However, this scenario seems to be unlikely for WKK 4438
due to its small viewing angle and truncated disk.

It is now becoming apparent that these extreme out-
ﬂows are variable phenomena in various sources, such as
IRAS 13224−3809 (Parker et al. 2017b; Pinto et al. 2018),
Mrk 509 (Cappi et al. 2009), PDS 456 (Reeves et al. 2009;
Nardini et al. 2015; Matzeu et al. 2016), and PG1211+143
(Pounds et al. 2003; Reeves et al. 2018a). In many of these
cases, the black hole masses are high (e.g. MBH ≈ 109M(cid:12)
for PDS 456 and MBH ≈ 108M(cid:12) for PG1211+143). How-
ever, similar to IRAS 13224−3809, the mass of the black
hole in WKK 4438 is rather low (MBH ≈ 2 × 106 M(cid:12), Mal-
izia et al. (2008)). This means the outﬂow in WKK 4438
is potentially of particular interest, as variability timescales
are generally expected to scale with black hole mass. It may
therefore be possible to study the variability of the outﬂow in
WKK 4438 – and any potential response to intrinsic changes
in the source – with a few deep observations in the future.
Unfortunately, the data currently available do not have suf-
ﬁcient signal-to-noise or broadband coverage to undertake
more studies at the present time.
