Abstract: Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) have shown stable operation at the Large Hadron
Collider and satisfactory eﬃciency for the entire Run 1 (2010-2013) and Run 2 (2015-2018) with
C2H2F4-based gas mixtures and the addition of SF6 and i-C4H10. Since its global warming potential
(GWP) is high, C2H2F4 is phasing out of production due to recent European Union regulations and
as a result its cost is progressively increasing. Therefore, ﬁnding a new RPC gas mixture with a
low GWP has become extremely important.

This contribution describes the simulation of the RPC eﬃciency with tetraﬂuoropropene
C3H2F4 (HFO1234ze), a hydroﬂuorooleﬁn with very low GWP. Simulation results are system-
atically compared with measurements of RPC eﬃciency in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with the
addition of diﬀerent combinations of Ar, He, CO2, O2 and i-C4H10 in various concentrations. This
simulation allows the study of the interplay between C3H2F4 and the other gas components in the
mixture as well as may allow the identiﬁcation of the most promising environment-friendly gas
mixtures with C3H2F4 for RPCs.

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) have shown stable operation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
and satisfactory eﬃciency for the entire Run 1 (2010-2013) and Run 2 (2015-2018) with C2H2F4-
based gas mixtures and the addition of i-C4H10 and SF6. The RPC gas mixture at the ATLAS and
CMS experiments contains 4.5% i-C4H10 and 0.3% SF6 while the concentrations of i-C4H10 and
SF6 in the ALICE gas mixture are 10.0% and 0.3%, respectively.

The heat trapped by a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is assessed by its global warming
potential (GWP). The GWP of CO2 is equal to 1 by deﬁnition while this potential is even more than
three orders of magnitude for C2H2F4 (GWP = ~1430 [1]). Since the concentration of C2H2F4 in
RPC gas mixtures is high (between 89% and 95%), more than 95% of their total GWP is due to the
presence of C2H2F4.

Recent regulations from the European Union (EU) impose a gradual limitation of the production
of ﬂuorinated greenhouse gases (such as C2H2F4) [1]. As a result, their cost is progressively
increasing. In parallel, CERN has elaborated a number of strategies to reduce as much as possible
the emissions of greenhouse gases or, at least, optimize their use in the LHC experiments [2].
For these reasons, ﬁnding a new gas mixture with a low GWP for RPCs has become extremely
important.

The usage of tetraﬂuoropropene C3H2F4 (HFO1234ze) for RPC gas mixtures has widely been
explored in the recent years as this gas may represent an environment-friendly alternative to C2H2F4
[3–9]. Indeed, the GWP of C3H2F4 is less than 1 according to the last Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report [10]. As far as we know, all ﬁndings on eco-friendly
gas mixture for RPCs have exclusively been obtained by an experimental approach so far [3–9].
its electron collision
Indeed, the lack of knowledge on fundamental parameters of C3H2F4, e.g.
cross sections, makes the implementation of this gas in simulations rather diﬃcult [8].

One of the main issue in the identiﬁcation of a suitable RPC gas mixture with a low environ-
mental impact is the operating voltage of the detector that must be within a limited high voltage

– 1 –

(HV) range [8]. This implies the need to understand how the RPC performance and, in particular,
its eﬃciency curve as a function of the HV change due to the interplay between C3H2F4 and the
other gas components in the mixture.

In this work we report a simulation study of the RPC eﬃciency in several C3H2F4-based gas
mixtures with the addition of various gases in diﬀerent concentrations. Simulation results are
systematically compared with our measurements [8, 9] in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures in order to
validate the simulation and obtain a reliable tool to identify the most promising gas mixtures with
a low GWP for RPCs.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we describe the REFF (RPC EFFiciency)
simulation and its validation. A systematic comparison between simulation and measurement of
the RPC eﬃciency in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures is presented in section 3. Finally, conclusions
are drawn in section 4.

2 REFF simulation and its validation

The REFF simulation implements a simpliﬁed method to evaluate the RPC eﬃciency as a function
of the HV in diﬀerent gas mixtures. Indeed, the eﬃciency is assessed by simulating the avalanche
size at the anode, originated by the primary electrons in the gas gap of the detector. These primary
electrons are released by the passage of an incoming radiation due to the ionization of the gas
mixture in the detector.

Input values of the REFF simulation are the volume composition of the gas mixture and its
density, the type and energy of the ionizing particle, and the eﬀective ionization Townsend coeﬃcient
for each HV value of interest. The initial position of clusters in the gas gap and the number of
primary electrons in each cluster are evaluated by HEED [11], which is a dedicated toolkit for
this purpose. The number of primary electrons in C3H2F4 is assumed to be ~9/mm according to
the Benussi at al.’s simulation [12]. Concerning the eﬀective ionization Townsend coeﬃcient as a
function of the HV, this parameter is evaluated by a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation [13] starting
from the scattering cross sections of electrons in the gas mixture of interest. For all gases, except for
C3H2F4, we use the electron collision cross sections provided by Biagi [14] as they are extensively
tested in the MAGBOLTZ program [15]. On the contrary, the set of electron collision cross sections
for C3H2F4 has been obtained by an iterative method of unfolding the electron swarm parameters
in C3H2F4 [13], measured by Chachereau et al. [16]. As far as we know, other sets of electron
collision cross sections for C3H2F4 are not currently available in the literature. More details on the
iterative method as well as on the electron collision cross sections of C3H2F4, used in this work,
can be found in previous works [13, 17].

In the REFF simulation the avalanche development is modeled as an exponential growth. In
particular, the electron mean free path X is determined by the inverse of the eﬀective ionization
Townsend coeﬃcient (αeﬀ ), which is the sum of ionization (α) and attachment (η) Townsend
coeﬃcients. If the attachment coeﬃcient cannot be determined, η is assumed null while α becomes
equal to αeﬀ . Subsequently, the distance ∆x is deﬁned as a fraction of the electron mean free path.
In this work, ∆x is arbitrarily chosen two orders of magnitude lower than X.

The charge multiplication in the avalanche is simulated by progressively increasing the tra-
jectory of each electron in the gas gap along the direction of the electric ﬁeld until all electrons

– 2 –

reach the anode. In particular, the position of electrons is incremented by ∆x if a random number,
generated from a uniform distribution in the interval from 0 to 1, is higher than ∆x
X . On the contrary,
if the condition is not veriﬁed, either an ionization or an attachment occurs. The selection of the
right process to simulate is done by comparing an additional random number s generated by the
same uniform distribution with the ratio
(α+η) is veriﬁed, the electron is
attached and thus the simulation of its trajectory in the gas gap is stopped, otherwise a new electron
is added to the avalanche at the same position of the incident electron and its trajectory will be
simulated until it is attached or reaches the anode. For simplicity, only electrons are considered
in the REFF simulation, whereas ions are not taken into account as well as the deformation of the
electric ﬁeld lines due to space charge eﬀects along the gas gap.

(α+η) . If the condition s ≤ η

η

In order to calculate the detector eﬃciency for the gas mixture of interest and at a given
value of HV, a number of diﬀerent avalanche sizes at the anode are calculated and then compared
to a threshold value of electrons that roughly represents the electronic threshold of the front-end
electronics. This is a simpliﬁed way to evaluate the detector eﬃciency; alternatively, the Ramo-
Shockley teorem [18–20] should be considered for an accurate description of the signal formation
in RPCs.

The REFF simulation is validated by comparing its results with measurements of RPC eﬃciency
as a function of the HV at 1000 mbar and 293 K in 90% C2H2F4 and 10% i-C4H10 and also in gas
mixtures of 55% C3H2F4 and the remaining fraction of Ar, CO2 or O2.

A dedicated experimental set-up with one small-size (50 × 50 cm2, 2 mm single-gap) bakelite
RPC has been used to measure the eﬃciency with diﬀerent gas mixtures. The features of the RPC
under test are similar to those of the ALICE-muon RPCs [21–23] while signals are discriminated by
the ampliﬁed front-end electronics FEERIC [24] with a threshold of ~130 fC. A detailed description
of the experimental set-up is reported in a previous work [8] while all measurements, presented in
this paper, are already published in [8, 9].

Figure 1a shows the simulation of the RPC eﬃciency curve in 90% C2H2F4 and 10% i-C4H10,
evaluating the avalanche size of at the anode 5000 events for each HV value ranging 8.5–10.5
kV. Simulations are carried out with α(HV) equal to the corresponding measurement of αeﬀ (HV),
obtained by Colucci et al. [25] in a laser beam experiment, and η(HV) equal to 0 mm−1. The
agreement between simulation results, calculated by assuming η = 0 mm−1, and experimental data
is fairly good. In fact, HV values at eﬃciency of 50% diﬀer in less than ~50 V, but their diﬀerence at
eﬃciency of 90% is more than ~300 V. It is important to highlight that the RPC eﬃciency does not
only depend on αeﬀ but it is aﬀected by the value of both α and η, as already observed by Riegler et
al. [20]. Since α and η are not experimentally measured, the value of η has been tuned from 0 to 20
mm−1 in order to achieve a satisfactory agreement between simulation results and measurements.
With η(HV) equal to 10 mm−1, diﬀerences between the simulation and the measurement are lower
than 10% for every HV values, as shown in ﬁgure 1a. As mentioned above, the RPC eﬃciency is
measured by FEERIC with a discrimination threshold of ~130 fC. This value corresponds to an
induced signal of about 106 electrons, assuming the bakelite permittivity of 10 and the electrode
thickness of 2 mm as in the case of the RPC under test [13, 20]. Therefore, the RPC eﬃciency in
the REFF simulation is calculated as the ratio between the number of avalanches with a size at the
anode greater than 106 electrons and the total number of simulated events.

The REFF simulation has also been validated in 55% C3H2F4 and the remaining fraction of Ar,

– 3 –

CO2 or O2. Since no measurements of αeﬀ are available in such gas mixtures, the input values of
αeﬀ as a function of the HV are obtained by a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation [13] starting from
the electron collision cross sections of C3H2F4, Ar, CO2 and O2. Figure 1b shows the comparison
of the measurement with the simulation when the RPC eﬃciency is evaluated with η = 0 mm−1
and 10 mm−1 in 55% C3H2F4 and 45% Ar. A better agreement is obtained if η is assumed to be
10 mm−1, as shown in ﬁgure 1a for the gas mixture 90% C2H2F4 and 10% i-C4H10. Hereafter, the
value of η is assumed to be 10 mm−1 in the following simulations.

data (a) in the gas mixture of 90% C2H2F4 and 10% i-C4H10 and (b) in the gas mixture of 55% C3H2F4 and
45% Ar. Simulation results are interpolated by sigmoid functions in both plots. Some statistical error bars
are hidden by markers.

3 Comparison of simulation and measurement of RPC eﬃciency in C3H2F4-based

gas mixtures

Several studies suggest that C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with the addition of CO2 or He might
be the most promising RPC gas mixtures with low GWP in terms of operating voltage, streamer
probability and cluster size [4, 8]. Therefore, the agreement between the REFF simulation results
and the experimental data are here evaluated for such type of gas mixtures; in particular, gas mixtures
of C3H2F4/CO2 with and without i-C4H10 and gas mixtures of C3H2F4/He with a small fraction of
i-C4H10. In all cases values of αeﬀ (HV) are calculated by the same Monte Carlo simulation [13]
used for the validation of the REFF simulation in C3H2F4-based gas mixtures.

3.1 Gas mixtures of C3H2F4/CO2 with and without i-C4H10

Figure 2 shows the simulation results and the experimental data of RPC eﬃciency as a function of
the HV with C3H2F4 and CO2 in diﬀerent concentrations. The agreement between simulation and
measurement of eﬃciency is good as well as the shift of the operating voltage, depending on the
ratio of C3H2F4/CO2, is correctly described by the REFF simulation. For eﬃciency values greater
than 70%, the diﬀerence between simulation results and experimental data is lower than ~10%,
whereas the diﬀerence of HV values at eﬃciency of 50% is lower than ~100 V.

Figure 3 shows eﬃciency curves as a function of the HV with 45% C3H2F4 and diﬀerent
concentrations of CO2 and i-C4H10. In this case eﬃciency curves do not turn out to be shifted

with i-C4H10 fractions lower than 10%. On the contrary, the shift of eﬃciency curves is observed
if more than 10% i-C4H10 is added in place of CO2. Similarly to the previous case, the shift of
eﬃciency curves due to the variation of the ratio between CO2 and i-C4H10 is well reproduced by
the REFF simulation. For eﬃciency values greater than 70%, the diﬀerence between simulation
and measurement is lower than ~10%, whereas the diﬀerence of HV values at eﬃciency of 50% is
lower than ~100 V.

3.2 Gas mixtures of C3H2F4 and He

Results of the REFF simulation are also in agreement with measurements taken with diﬀerent exper-
imental set-up and front-end electronics. In particular, the comparison is here done in gas mixtures
of C3H2F4 with the addition of He and a small fraction of i-C4H10. In this case measurements
are taken by Abbrescia et al. in a 2 mm single-gap RPC with bakelite electrodes at 990 mbar and
293 K while the discrimination threshold for the data acquisition is ~300 fC [4]. These parameters
are appropriately taken into account for the simulation of the RPC eﬃciency. Figure 4 shows

– 5 –

simulation results and experimental data of eﬃciency as a function of the HV in C3H2F4-based
gas mixtures with He and i-C4H10. The agreement between simulation and measurement is very
good in the gas mixture 55% C3H2F4, 40% He and 5% i-C4H10, in fact the diﬀerence is lower than
~10% for all HV values. Concerning the gas mixture 59% C3H2F4, 37% He and 4% i-C4H10, the
agreement between simulations and measurements is quite satisfactory, even if the eﬃciency curve
is not exactly reproduced by the REFF simulation. Nevertheless, the diﬀerence between simulation
results and experimental data is lower than ~15% for eﬃciency values greater than 70%, whereas
the diﬀerence of HV values at eﬃciency of 50% is lower than ~100 V.

4 Conclusions

We have presented a simulation procedure (REFF simulation) to calculate the eﬃciency of RPCs
with several C3H2F4-based gas mixtures and the addition of various gases. In this contribution
comparisons of simulation and measurement are only reported for the most promising RPC gas
mixtures based on C3H2F4, however we obtained reliable simulations of the RPC eﬃciency in
diﬀerent combinations of C3H2F4, Ar, CO2, He, i-C4H10 and O2 in various concentrations [13].
This highlights just how versatile the REFF simulation is for the identiﬁcation of the most promising
C3H2F4-based gas mixtures with a low GWP for RPCs. However, some limitations of this simulation
have been found in presence of SF6 in the gas mixture. Research into solving this issue is already
underway [13].
In parallel, we are currently investigating possible future improvements of our
simulation in order to estimate the RPC performance with C3H2F4-based gas mixtures in terms of
streamer probability, cluster size and time resolution.
