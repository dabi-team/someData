broad energy germanium detectors in combination
with pulse shape discrimination techniques and an

1 Introduction

In Gerda bare germanium diodes immersed in liq-
uid argon (LAr) are used both as the source and the
detector of the neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay

of 76Ge [1]. Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detec-
tors [2] were introduced to Gerda in Phase I and domi-
nate the Phase II detector inventory. BEGe detectors in
Gerda have better energy resolution than semi-coaxial
detectors and a signiﬁcantly thinner dead layer [3]. The
latter makes them prone to surface events, from the
beta particles, which can penetrate the dead layer. This
kind of background is considered to be one of the most
dangerous background sources in Gerda Phase II.

liquid argon. Cosmogenic 42Ar, present in natural
argon, decays into 42K. 42K is a beta emitter (Qβ =
3525 keV) with a half-life of 12.3 h (see Fig. 1). The

region of interest (ROI) of the 0νββ decay is centered
around Qββ = 2039 keV [4]. High energy electrons
E ≥ Qββ from 42K beta decays occurring very close to
the detector surface, can increase the background level
in the ROI.
During

of
Gerda Phase I it was found that the intensity of the
1525 keV gamma line from 42K is much higher than
42Ar
expected from homogeneous distribution of
assuming a natural abundance of <43 μBq/kg [6]. A
similar conclusion emerged from the measurements in
the LArGe test facility [7], operated in the framework
of Gerda. The measurements [3] show that the
enhancement of 42K background can be attributed to
an accumulation eﬀect: after the decay of their mother
isotope, 42K ions retain their positive charge long
enough to move in the electric ﬁeld of the germanium
detectors [8]. Consequently, the 42K distribution in
liquid argon is not homogeneous.

Enclosing a detector string with a cylinder made
from thin copper foil (called mini-shroud, MS) it is
possible to considerably suppress the background con-
tribution coming from the 42Ar decay chain [1]. The
mini-shroud screens the electric ﬁeld of the germanium
detectors and creates a mechanical barrier preventing
the collection of the 42K ions on detector surfaces and
thus decreasing the 42K background level. However, the
copper MS could not be used in Phase II: the main
reason is that argon scintillation light generated in-
side the copper MS would be blocked from detection
by the LAr veto, thus the veto eﬃciency would be se-
riously impaired. Another reason is that the radiopu-
rity of the copper MS used in Gerda Phase I does
not suﬃce the more stringent radiopurity requirements
of Phase II. Therefore, it was decided to develop a
new mini-shroud. Results from this development and
detailed tests of its 42Ar mitigation capability are de-
scribed here. BEGe detectors have powerful pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) capability which allows to miti-
gate surface events from 42K. The suppression capa-
bility of 42K background events by the PSD has been
tested in the current investigation. The suppression fac-
tors (SF) obtained with passive and active methods are
presented.

2 Experimental

2.1 Development of a transparent mini-shroud

42K background can be suppressed e.g. by modifying
the electric ﬁeld produced by the high voltage applied
to detectors, or by a mechanical barrier. Several ap-
plications were tested for Gerda(mini-shroud made of

copper mesh, copper plate, plastic scintillator, etc.) and
proved to work well in liquid argon. The solution de-
scribed here is the mini-shroud made from a transpar-
ent plastic foil. The MS does not screen the E-ﬁeld of
the detector, but as a mechanical barrier for 42K ions
prevents their drift towards the germanium detector.
The mini-shroud encapsulates the detector, but is not
tight to prevent liquid argon from pouring inside during
the immersion. The collected 42K atoms decay on the
foil’s surface at a distance of several millimeters from
the detector, thus beta particles are attenuated by liq-
uid argon.

A thin nylon ﬁlm (thickness 125 μm) was chosen as
the construction material. It is robust, durable and ﬂex-
ible. It has good transparency for the visible light and
exhibits a very low intrinsic radioactivity. Several pieces
of nylon ﬁlm were provided by Princeton University.
These are left-overs from the material used in Borexino
to construct the Inner Vessel [14]. The radioactive im-
purities are only 2 ppt for 238U and 4 ppt for 232Th [15].
Scintillation light emitted by liquid argon (128 nm)
must be converted to wavelengths suitable for scintil-
lation light detectors (sensitive range is about 250 –
500 nm). Thus the nylon mini-shroud (NMS) was cov-
ered with a wavelength shifter (WLS). It allows light
to pass through the nylon ﬁlm as it is opaque for deep
ultraviolet radiation (below 300 nm). The performance
of the WLS coating, its robustness and stability in time
were also investigated in various tests. These studies in-
clude an optimization of the composition and thickness
of the WLS coating.

The performance of the WLS coating was tested
with a UV spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse) at the
Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Kernphysik (MPIK) in Hei-
delberg. Direct investigation of the shifting of argon
scintillation light at 128 nm was not possible since no
light source in this far UV region was available. Instead,
a qualitative comparison was made with the emission
light of the spectrophotometer at 200 nm.

(TPB) with
polystyrene (PS) in a ratio of 1:10 in toluene (recipe
previously used for coating of the VM2000 reﬂection
foil in LArGe [16]). To improve the performance of the
nylon mini-shroud we increased the concentration of
TPB and replaced toluene by dichlormethane (DCM)
as the latter is used for the production of the reﬂector
foils in Gerda Phase II [17]. A higher concentration
of TPB in the polystyrene matrix increases
the
intensity of emitted light (see Fig. 2). However, too
high TPB concentration decreases the mechanical
stability of the coating. Finally, a TPB concentration
in the range of 30% - 40% in the polystyrene matrix

proved to be a good balance between mechanical
stability and light emission eﬃciency. The coating was
applied by brushing both sides of nylon samples. The
amount of deposited WLS (typically 0.3 mg per 1 cm2)
was estimated by weighting the nylon before and after
coating.

Various tests were performed in order to understand
the usability of such a foil in Gerda. Immersion of
the nylon ﬁlm in liquid nitrogen showed that it keeps
ﬂexibility at low temperatures and does not become
brittle even after several weeks spent in cryogenic liq-
uid. Long term stability of the coated nylon foils was
checked in liquid nitrogen (ﬁve months) and liquid ar-
gon (two months in the LArGe cryostat). No visible de-
terioration of the coated surfaces was found. Changes in
optical properties of the WLS were checked with a UV
spectrophotometer. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of sam-
ples kept for ﬁve months in liquid nitrogen (blue dots)
and in air (red dots). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the two ﬂuorescence spectra was observed.

To construct the NMS fully covering the detector (or
a string of detectors) it is necessary to connect several
nylon sheets together to form a cylindrical shape. Such
connections should be radioactively clean and robust

nylon sheets were connected by welding. Right: NMS in as-

enough to survive manual handling and immersion into
liquid argon. The ﬁrst version of the mini-shroud was
created by welding (see Fig. 4) not requiring any ad-
ditional material, but the connections were brittle and
easily damaged during handling. Finally, nylon pieces
were glued using a solution of resorcinol in ethanol and
water with sodium meta-bisulphite [18]. It was con-
ﬁrmed that the connections are very robust and suitable
for cryogenic operations. The glued NMS was placed
around a dummy detector string (aluminum dummies
of detectors and holders) and it was submerged in liquid
nitrogen, showing that it is robust enough and can keep
its shape during the slow immersion process (∼1 hour)
of the detector strings in Gerda. To minimize the risk
of contamination, all preparations were performed in
the clean room. Before the insertion into liquid argon,
the NMS went through several outgassing cycles.

2.2 Contribution of the NMS to the Gerda
background index

The content of radio-impurities of coated nylon ﬁlms
was checked by ICP-MS to verify that no signiﬁcant
background contribution is added to GERDA [19]. Re-
sults of the measurements are summarized in Tab. 1.
The diﬀerence in the radioactive contamination of the
starting foil material and the aggregated contamination
of the ﬁnal NMS may have been introduced during the
preparation of the samples. The nylon cylinder for each
Gerda Phase II detector string typically has a height
of 430 mm and a diameter of 103 mm. The mass of the
NMS is about 28 g. We expect about 6.1 μBq of 238U
and about 2.6 μBq of 232Th reside in a single NMS.

To prove that this radiopurity level is acceptable,
a detailed simulation of the NMS background for
the Gerda Phase II setup was performed. This
Monte Carlo simulation is based on the MaGe
framework [20] with the preliminary Gerda Phase II
geometry, using 7 detectors strings with one NMS
each, under the assumption of equilibrium in the
U/Th chains [13]. The simulation code is validated
with the Gerda calibration data. Radioactive isotopes
were homogeneously distributed inside the NMS
material. The simulated energy spectra of germanium
detectors taken with 214Bi and 208Tl sources are
shown in Fig. 5. Tracking of optical photons and the
evaluation of the LAr veto suppression were only
performed in the energy region of 1800-2300 keV,
to save computation time. Suppression factors of
33±4 and ≥ 2000 are obtained for 214Bi and 208Tl
respectively. The large suppression is due to the
thinness of the NMS which allows the betas from
208Tl and 214Bi to escape the nylon and deposits a
large fraction of their energy in the LAr. This creates
a large scintillation signal which can be easily vetoed.
The estimated contributions to the background index
(BI) for 214Bi are 1.8×10−4 cts/(keV·kg·yr) before and
5.3×10−6 cts/(keV·kg·yr) after applying the LAr veto.
For 208Tl these values are 2.7×10−4 cts/(keV·kg·yr)
and <1.4×10−7 cts/(keV·kg·yr) before and after the
LAr veto, respectively. The combination of these
values gives the total contribution of the NMS to
in Gerda Phase II of about 4.6×10−4
the BI
cts/(keV·kg·yr) and 5.3×10−6 cts/(keV·kg·yr) before
and after the LAr veto, respectively. These values are
well below the Gerda Phase II requirements (total
BI<1×10−3 cts/(keV·kg·yr)).

ulated spectra before cuts are shown in black, after the de-
tector anti-coincidence (AC) in blue and after applying the

coincidence spectrum was only performed near Qββ, to save
computation time.

2.3 Experimental setup

the

42K background
Detailed investigations
of
were performed in the LArGe test facility [7]. The
setup allows to operate bare germanium detectors
submerged in 1 m3 of liquid argon. The cryostat is
equipped with nine photomultiplier tubes (PMT) in
order to suppress background events by detecting
in liquid argon, occurring in
scintillation light
coincidence with germanium detector events (LAr
veto). The LArGe setup is located at the Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) Underground
Laboratory at 3800 m w.e. depth. An achieved
background index in LArGe [7] is close to to the level
of Gerda Phase I. Hence, an investigation of low
background sources is possible.

The measurements in LArGe were performed with a
BEGe detector produced by Canberra [9]. The scheme
of the detector and its dimensions are shown in Fig. 6. It
is a p-type diode with the mass of 878 g. The thickness
of the dead layer is estimated to be 0.6 mm. The de-
tector mounting procedure and the holder design is the

sus the suppressed (NS) spectrum. For measurements
with LAr veto in order to be independent of the source
strength the LAr acceptance (εLAr) is taken into ac-
count, hense SF = (N0 − B0) · εLAr/(NS − BS), B0 and
BS are the background levels before and after suppres-
sion respectively.

3.1 Suppression of 42K background by NMS

The BEGe detector inside the NMS (Fig. 7) was sub-
merged into the LArGe cryostat. No deterioration of
the detector’s performance was found when operated
with the NMS. A typical energy resolution of the detec-
tor is about 2.9 keV at the 2.6 MeV of the 208Tl gamma
line, similar to measurements without NMS. The energy
spectra with and without NMS are shown in Figure 8.
The measurement without NMS was taken for a
shorter time, therefore its spectrum is scaled to the
NMS measurement time. Tab. 2 shows results from the
calculation of the SF in the ”beta region” using the ra-
tio of count rates with and without NMS. The ﬁrst two
days of data taking are not taken into account in or-
der to reduce the inﬂuence of previously accumulated

same as in Gerda Phase I [1], i.e. usage of low-mass and
radio-pure materials close to the detector is implied. A
Gerda Phase I custom made charge-sensitive pream-
pliﬁer (CC2) with integrated J-FET transistor and RC
feedback components is used for the signal condition-
ing [10]. Signals are digitized with a Flash-ADC (Struck
SIS3301 VME, 14 bit, 100 MHz) card.

In order to enhance the 42K signal, two 42Ar
sources with activities of (5.18 ± 0.91) Bq and (79
± 15) Bq were produced by irradiating a cell ﬁlled
with gaseous natAr at
the accelerator operated
the
in the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratory (MLL) of
Technische Universit¨at M¨unchen
(TUM). The
sources were introduced into the LArGe cryostat
and homogeniously distributed inside LAr. With
the enhanced signal rate from 42K it is possible to
investigate the behavior of 42K ions and to test
diﬀerent background suppression methods with better
counting statistics. The long measurement without
NMS and measurement with a ﬁrst version of the
NMS were performed after the insertion of the source
with lower activity. Measurements with the second,
ﬁnal version of the NMS were done with both sources
inside LAr. The 42Ar activity of
these sources
increased the count rate of the 1525 keV gamma peak
(with respect
to the measurements with natural
argon) by factors of about 40 and 200, respectively.
The increase is not exactly proportional to the activity
due to the evaporation of liquid argon during reﬁlling
of the cryostat.

3 Measurements of suppression factors

The energy region of 1540 – 3000 keV (”beta region”)
contains predominantly surface events from beta par-
ticles (see the 42K decay scheme in Fig. 1) and over-
laps the Qββ±200 keV energy region. The energy region
1520–1530 keV mostly contains events from the 1525
keV gamma line.

presses the ratio of events in the unsuppressed (N0) ver-

ﬁrst two days (see Figure 9) is also taken into account
during calculation of the SF (henceforth referenced as
”long-term correction”). Thus the SF is estimated to
be 14.3(2.1).

3.2 Suppression of 42K background by PSD and LAr
veto

A strong weighting potential close to the read-out elec-
trode in the BEGe-type detectors enables a powerful
pulse shape discrimination (PSD) of the acquired sig-
nals [11]. The PSD used in this work is based on the
method described in [12]. It was developed for the dis-
crimination between single-site events (SSE) and multi-
site events (MSE) using diﬀerences in the amplitudes of
current pulses with the same energy. The 0νββ events
are expected to be SSE due to a rather short path
length of beta particles in the germanium detectors. In
contrast, photons will often undergo several scatterings
and are mostly MSE. Surface events exhibit a slower
rising edge of the pulse due to diﬀusion of the electric
charge into the n+ surface areas (n+ contact surface
pulses, NSP). In consequence, these events have smaller
amplitude to energy (A/E) ratio compared to events in

the bulk of the detector. The events that deposit energy
near the p+ contact of the detector (p+ contact pulses,
PCP) have higher amplitudes than SSE, and they can
be rejected as well.

The PSD cut parameters were determined from cal-
ibration data taken with a 228Th source. Events in the
double escape peak (DEP) of the 2.6 MeV gamma line
of 208Tl are predominantly single-site with a shape sim-
ilar to 0νββ events. The low cut is usually determined
in order to keep 90% of the events in the DEP. Fig. 10
demonstrates such PSD cut obtained for the measure-
ment with the BEGe detector in LArGe (rejected events
are in the MSE region below the black line). The slope
of the lines is determined from the distribution of the
Compton scattering events. The p+ events are rejected
by applying a high cut (these events are above the red
line in Fig. 10). After applying low and high cuts 88%
of the events are kept in the DEP.

The ﬁrst tests of 42K suppression by PSD were per-
formed with the bare BEGe detector in LArGe without
a mini-shroud with the smaller 42Ar source. The A/E
distribution is shown in Fig. 11. The majority of events
coming from the beta decay of 42K are located below
the SSE band. They are predominantly NSP from elec-
trons which deposit their energy in the n+ surface of
the germanium detector. Only a small amount of the
events are located in the SSE band.

The LAr veto is not very eﬃcient in suppressing
events from 42K in the ROI, because such electrons of-
ten do not deposit much energy in liquid argon. How-
ever, combined PSD and LAr veto work eﬃciently, help-
ing to suppress diﬀerent types of background. The LAr

Part of the events in the SSE band are coming from
other background sources (mostly from 228Th). Such

by the scintillation veto [7]. After applying PSD and

For a precise
the
remaining background sources have to be taken into
consideration. Unfortunately,
no measurements
prior to dissolving of 42Ar are available for this
detector to estimate the background level. So it is
estimated with help of previous investigations with
an encapsulated semi-coaxial germanium detector.
The background level of that detector was (0.12 –
4.6)×10−2 cts/(keV·kg·yr) after LAr veto [7].
It
was dominated by 208Tl external to the cryostat,

presumably from the PMTs [7], so we can expect to
have this background with other detectors as well.
In addition to this background the contribution of
cosmogenic background from 68Ga in the BEGe
detector is taken into account. The background index
after applying the LAr veto and PSD is estimated
with help of previous investigations in LArGe [7] and
simulations [13]. The accumulated statistics is not
enough to ﬁnd precisely the suppression factor for
the 42K background in the ROI, but it is possible
to obtain a lower limit of >121 at 90% C.I. for the
combined LAr veto and PSD cuts. This value is
obtained with help of TRolke class [22] assuming
poisson statistics of the signal. This value can be
improved by applying a stronger PSD cut: after
applying 73% PSD cut (low 75% and high cuts) no
events survive the PSD veto (see Fig. 11).

It is necessary to notice that the suppression fac-
tor of PSD depends on the detector performance: with
worse A/E resolution some of the events can leak into
the SSE band, reducing the eﬃciency of PSD cuts. That
is why the SF achieved in LArGe may be slightly dif-
ferent than for the detectors in Gerda Phase II with
diﬀerent PSD performance.

3.3 42K background suppression of NMS combined
with PSD and LAr veto

The performance of the LAr veto with introduced NMS
was investigated with a 228Th source and with spiked
42Ar in liquid argon. The suppression factors of the LAr
veto are obtained with the two versions of the NMSs
and without it (see Tab. 4). The LAr veto SFs improves
when using the NMS, which is clearly seen in the sup-
pression of the 42K gamma line. The absorption length
of light shifted by NMS is much longer compared to
the 128 nm scintillation light, and thus more light can
reach the LAr veto light instrumentation. This may be

a possible reason of the enhanced performance of the
LAr veto.

The combined performance of the NMS, PSD and
LAr veto is scrutinized by 42Ar measurements of the
BEGe detector with the NMS. The A/E distribution
measured with the 42Ar source and with LAr veto is
shown in Fig. 12. In this measurement the ﬁnal, glued
version of the NMS was implemented. Both 42Ar
sources were spiked into the LArGe cryostat. Similarly
to the previous measurements without NMS, most of
the events coming from 42K are rejected by PSD. The
remaining part is removed by the LAr veto. The LAr
veto allows to suppress events located in the SSE
band more eﬃciently than in the MSE band (see
Fig. 12). This is an indication that most of the events
in the SSE band are not electrons from 42K. The
number of events surviving PSD and LAr veto are
shown in Tab. 5. From the initial 216 events in the
ROI only 2 events survive after applying LAr veto and
PSD cuts. The estimated number of background
events is 0.4. After taking into account the pulser
acceptance, the SF is greater than 38 (90% C.I.). By

Fig. 13 shows the comparison of spectra with and
without NMS and the eﬀect of active 42Ar suppression.
The gray area shows the spectrum of the bare BEGe
detector without NMS scaled to the measurement time
with the NMS. Other spectra demonstrate the 42K sup-
pression by the NMS and diﬀerent cuts. In the scaled
energy spectrum registered without the NMS there are
4384 events in ROI. After applying the PSD cut and
the LAr veto only 2 events survive, including an esti-
mated background of 0.4 events. Taking into account
other than 42K background components, LAr veto and
the NMS suppression factor, the resulting suppression
factor is higher than 513 at 90% C.I. is obtained. (see
Tab. 6).

The measurement with NMS has lower counting
statistics compared to measurements without NMS.
However, there is no indication that PSD performance
in case of NMS is worse than in the measurements
without NMS. The LAr veto works slightly better in
case of NMS, but it almost does not suppress events
from 42K in the ROI, that is why it has little eﬀect on
the results. Therefore it is safe to assume SF > 121,
obtained in the measurement without NMS and better
statistics (see Tab. 6) instead of SF > 38. With the
NMS suppression factor of 14.3(2.1) using SF > 121
for PSD and LAr veto a total SF of greater than 1476
is obtained.

ties. The dead layer thickness has a big inﬂuence on
the 42K count rate in the ROI. That is why this fac-
tor is taken into consideration with the help of simula-
tions. From these calculations it is expected that a bare
BEGe detector in Gerda without a mini-shroud and
before applying any cuts has a 42K BI in the range of
[2.1..8]×10−1 cts/(keV·kg·yr). The lower bound corre-
sponds to a dead layer thickness of 1.0 mm with minimal
expectation for the 42K concentration in liquid argon,
the higher value corresponds to 0.6 mm thickness and
maximal expectation for the 42K concentration. A typi-
cal value of the dead layer of a BEGe detector in Gerda
is about 0.8 mm [3], so the limit for the 42K background
rate is expected to lay in the quoted range. By apply-
ing the SF derived in LArGe we obtain the background
expectations in Gerda like setup after NMS, PSD and
LAr veto (see Tab. 6).

However, it is necessary to note that obtained val-
ues just demonstrate possibility to suppress 42Ar back-
ground to desired level, but can not be applied directly
to Gerda setup. Gerda has 30 BEGe detectors and
the LAr veto is rather diﬀerent compared to LArGe. In
principle, the diﬀerence in the LAr veto should not af-
fect much the total suppression of the 42K background,
while its suppression is low (factor ∼ 1.2) compared
to NMS and PSD (see Tab. 4). But some of the de-
tectors in Gerda have a worse PSD performance than
one tested in LArGe, so a worse suppression by PSD
is expected for these detectors. One the other hand the
suppression factors of NMS in Gerda should be higher
due to the better design of the Gerda NMS with less
inner volume for each detector.

However, all these diﬀerences should not be very
big and current calculation gives a good estimate

3.4 The NMS for Gerda Phase II

For each detector string in Gerda a dedicated NMS
was prepared and mounted. A photo of the Gerda
Phase II integration is shown in Fig. 14. The setup was
introduced into the Gerda cryostat and data taking
successfully started. The achieved background rate in
Gerda Phase II after all cuts is approximately 1×10−3
cts/(keV·kg·yr), satisfying desired speciﬁcations [23].
So the described concept of 42Ar background suppres-
sion has proven its eﬀectiveness. Using SFs obtained in
LArGe it is possible to estimate the 42K background
level in Gerda Phase II like setup.

The expected 42K background rate in Gerda is es-
timated by scaling the 42Ar background in LArGe to
Gerda using the ratio of the 1525 keV line intensi-

4 Conclusions

Our investigation shows that the NMS alone is an ef-
ﬁcient tool to suppress the background caused by 42K
about 15 times. It is also demonstrated that PSD is a
very good method to mitigate surface events from 42K
decays. Results of the measurements in LArGe with a
combination of NMS show that the NMS together with
the PSD and LAr veto can suppress 42K background
by more than 3 orders of magnitude.

can be further improved by a stronger PSD cut or by
