ABSTRACT

In this paper we probe ﬁve cosmological models for which the dark energy equation of state parameter,
w(z), is parameterized as a function of redshift using strong lensing data in the galaxy cluster Abell
1689. We constrain the parameters of the w(z) functions by reconstructing the lens model under
each one of these cosmologies with strong lensing measurements from two galaxy clusters: Abell 1689
and a mock cluster, Ares, from the Hubble Frontier Fields Comparison Challenge, to validate our
methodology. To quantify how the cosmological constraints are biased due to systematic eﬀects in the
strong lensing modeling, we carry out three runs considering the following uncertainties for the multiple
images positions: 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), and 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48). With Ares, we ﬁnd that larger errors decrease the systematic
bias on the estimated cosmological parameters. With real data, our strong-lensing constraints on
w(z) are consistent those derived from other cosmological probes. We conﬁrm that strong lensing
cosmography with galaxy clusters is a promising method to constrain w(z) parameterizations. A
better understanding of galaxy clusters and their environment is however needed to improve the SL
modeling and hence to estimate stringent cosmological parameters in alternatives cosmologies.

1. INTRODUCTION

In addition, the coincidence problem, i.e.

Current cosmological observations provide strong evidence that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating (Riess
et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016b). The source of this cosmic acceleration is a big
puzzle in modern cosmology and two hypothesis have been proposed to explain it: either to postulate the existence
of a dark energy component or to modify the gravity laws (Joyce et al. 2016). Among the ﬁrst kind of models, the
cosmological constant, which is commonly associated to the quantum vacuum energy, has been established as the
preferred candidate to the nature of dark energy by several cosmological measurements (e.g. Planck Collaboration
et al. 2016a). By deﬁnition, the equation of state (EoS, hereafter) parameter of the cosmological constant is w = −1.
Nonetheless, when a general constant equation of state is considered, the data constrain w = −1.019+0.075
−0.080 (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2016b, see also Neveu et al. 2017), which is consistent with the cosmological constant. In spite
of this consistency, the theoretical expected value of the vacuum energy diﬀers in many orders of magnitude from
the observed one.
the similitude seen at the current time between the
dark matter energy density and that of DE, remains unsolved (Zeldovich 1968; Weinberg 1989). Several dark energy
(DE, hereafter) models, as for instance, dynamical dark energy or interacting dark energy (Copeland et al. 2006; Li
et al. 2011), are also in agreement with the data and they can satisfactorily describe the late-time acceleration of the
Universe in a similar way as the cosmological constant does (Ferreira et al. 2017; Salvatelli et al. 2014; Zhao et al.
2017). Therefore, to distinguish which cosmological model is the more suitable to the nature of dark energy, we need
to put tight constraints on their parameters. A standard way to estimate these parameters is to perform a Bayesian
analysis using classic cosmological probes, i.e. to ﬁt the distance modulus of type Ia distant supernovae (SNIa), Hubble
parameter measurements, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal, and the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation (Davis 2014; Mortonson et al. 2014). Although these tests are widely used to constrain
cosmological models, they could yield to biased estimations because either the data or the test ﬁtting formulas are
derived assuming an underlying standard cosmology ΛCDM (i.e.
the cosmological constant as dark energy plus
cold dark matter). Thus, it is essential to construct methods to estimate the parameters of alternative cosmologies
without assuming any ﬁducial cosmology. One novel technique is to use strong lensing measurements in galaxy clusters.

Strong gravitational lensing (SL, hereafter) oﬀers a unique and independent opportunity to constrain dark energy
features without prior assumptions on the ﬁducial cosmology. Link & Pierce (1998) introduced a new approach by
leveraging the cosmological sensitivity of the angular size-redshift relation when multiples imaged systems (over a
broad range of redshift) are produced by strong lensing clusters. This technique was later on extended to more complex
simulated clusters by Golse et al. (2002) and to real clusters such as Abell 2218 (see Soucail et al. 2004), showing
that SL cosmography is a promising geometrical cosmological test. Jullo et al. (2010) used an improved technique
which simultaneously reconstructed the mass distribution of Abell 1689 (A1689, hereafter), adopting a parametric lens
modeling, and constrained the parameters of a wCDM cosmology. For the ﬁrst time, the authors obtained competitive
constraints on the equation of state parameter and found that, by combining their results with other probes, they
improved the DE EoS estimation by ∼ 30%. Following the same method, Caminha et al. (2016) recently used the
SL measurements in Abell S1063 with the pre-Frontier Fields data to constrain cosmological parameters for three
diﬀerent ΛCDM models. They pointed out the importance of estimating the parameters using multiply lensed sources
with a wide range of redshifts. The authors also showed that the lack of spectroscopic measurements or the use of
inaccurate photometric redshifts leads to a biased estimation of the cosmological parameters. Maga˜na et al. (2015)
exploited this technique too, but using alternative cosmologies. They used A1689 strong lensing measurements to con-
strain four dark energy models: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Interacting Dark Energy (IDE), Ricci Holographic
Dark Energy (RHDE), and Modiﬁed Polytropic Cardassian (MPC) . They found that the SL method provides CPL
constraints in good agreement with those obtained with the SNe Ia, BAO and CMB data. In addition, the IDE and
RHDE constraints derived from SL are similar to those estimated with other tests. Nevertheless, the IDE constraints
are consistent with the complementary bounds only if an increase in the image-position error (ﬁve times the one
previously used by Jullo et al. 2010) is considered in the lens modeling. They conﬁrmed that, to avoid misleading DE
bounds, it is important to consider larger positional uncertainties for the multiple images; which could be associated
with systematic errors.

3

Indeed, SL has various known sources of systematic errors. D’Aloisio & Natarajan (2011), using simulations of
cluster lenses, showed that the observational errors (for space-based images) are an order of magnitude smaller that
the modeling errors. Furthermore, line-of-sight (LOS) structures can introduce a systematic error in the strong lensing
modeling (e.g. Bayliss et al. 2014; Giocoli et al. 2016; Host 2012; Jaroszynski & Kostrzewa-Rutkowska 2014; McCully
et al. 2014) of up to ∼ 1.4(cid:48)(cid:48) on the position of multiple images (Zitrin et al. 2015). Even distant massive structures
in the lens plane have a signiﬁcant impact on the position of multiple images (Tu et al. 2008; Limousin et al. 2010).
Harvey et al. (2016), by analyzing the Frontier Field cluster MACSJ0416 (z = 0.397), estimated an error of ∼ 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)
on the position of the multiple images when assuming that light traces mass in the SL modeling. However, few stud-
ies have investigated their impact on the retrieval of cosmological parameters (McCully et al. 2017; Acebron et al. 2017).

In this paper, we are interested in quantifying the uncertainties in the estimation of cosmological parameters induced
by diﬀerent positional errors of the multiple images. To this end, we analyze the strong lensing eﬀect in the galaxy
cluster A1689, as well as in a mock galaxy cluster at z = 0.5 generated in a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology. Because in the CLP
case it is possible to obtain tight constraints on its parameters (see Maga˜na et al. 2015) using the SL methodology
proposed by Jullo et al. (2010), in this work we consider popular CPL-like models in which the EoS of dark energy is
parametrized as function of redshift.

The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, §2, we introduce the cosmological framework and the para-
metric dark energy models. In section §3 we describe the SL data and methodology used to constrain the cosmological
parameters of the DE models. In section §4 we present and discuss the results. Finally, we provide our conclusions in
section §5.

2. COSMOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK AND PARAMETRIC DARK ENERGY MODELS

For a homogeneous, isotropic, and ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, the expansion

rate of the Universe is governed by the Friedmann equation:

H 2(z) ≡

8πG
3

(cid:88)

i

ρi(z),

(1)

where H ≡ ˙a/a is the Hubble parameter, a is the scale factor of the Universe, and ρi denotes the energy density for
each component in the Universe1. We consider cold dark matter (m) and radiation (r) components whose dynamics are
described by a perfect ﬂuid with EoS wm = 0 and wr = 1/3, respectively. In addition, we also consider a dynamical

parameters, Ωi ≡ 8πGρi/3H(z)2, for each component, the Eq. 1 reads as:

E2(z) = Ωm(1 + z)3 + Ωr(1 + z)4 + Ωdefde(z),
where E(z) = H(z)/H0 is the dimensionless Hubble parameter, Ωr = 2.469 × 10−5h−2(1 + 0.2271Nef f ), with h =
H0/100kms−1Mpc−1, Nef f = 3.04 is the standard number of relativistic species (Komatsu et al. 2011), and Ωde can
be expressed as Ωde = 1 − Ωm − Ωr. The function fde(z) is deﬁned as:

Notice that, by introducing a w(z) functional form in the integral of the Eq. (3), we can obtain an analytical expression
for fde(z), and hence for E(z).

Besides, to test whether the constraints for each parametric DE model result in a late cosmic acceleration, we

examine the deceleration parameter q(z) deﬁned as:

Using Eq. (2), we obtain:

which expresses the deceleration parameter in terms of the dimensionless Hubble parameter.

2.1. Parametric dark energy models

One alternative to the cosmological constant is to consider a dark energy component which admits a time-dependent
EoS. An eﬀective and simple way to study dynamical dark energy models is to assume a phenomenological parame-
terization of the EoS (Lazkoz et al. 2005; Pantazis et al. 2016). Commonly, this EoS is biparametric and it depends
on the scale factor of redshift. The most popular ansatz, denoted Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization, (in-
troduced and revisited by Chevallier & Polarski 2001; Linder 2003, respectively) is w(z) = w0 + w1z/(1 + z), where
w0 is the present value of the equation of state and w1 = dw(z)/dz|z=0. In this paper we study ﬁve CPL-like EoS
parameterizations (see Maga˜na et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2016, for details), in the following, we brieﬂy introduce the
functional form of these parameterizations.

• Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP).- Jassal et al. (2005b,a) proposed that the dark energy EoS is parameterized

by the function

w(z) = w0 + w1

z
(1 + z)2 ,

(6)

which allows rapid variations at low z. The DE has the same EoS at the present epoch and at high redshift, i.e.,
w(∞) = w0. By substituting the Eq. (6) in Eq. (3) we obtain:

fde(z) = (1 + z)3(1+w0)exp

(cid:20) 3

w1z2
(1 + z)2

(cid:21)

.

(7)

• Barbosa-Alcaniz (BA).- Barboza & Alcaniz (2008) considered a parametric EoS for the dark energy component

given by:

w(z) = w0 + w1

z(1 + z)
1 + z2 .

(8)

This ansatz behaves linearly at low redshifts as w0 + w1, and w → w0 + w1z when z → ∞. In addition, w(z)
is well-behaved in all epochs of the Universe, for instance, the DE dynamics in the future, at z = −1, can be
investigated without dealing with a divergence. Solving the integral in Eq. (3) and using Eq. (8) results in:

• Feng-Shen-Li-Li (FSLL, Feng et al. 2012) suggested two dark energy EoS parameterizations given by:

fde(z) = (1 + z)3(1+w0)(1 + z2)

w(z) = w0 + w1

FSLLII.

(9)

(10)

(11)

Both functions have the advantage of being divergence-free throughout the entire cosmic evolution, even at
z = −1. At low redshifts, w(z) behaves as w0 + w1z and w0 + w1z2 for FSLLI and FSLLII respectively. In
addition, when z → ∞, the EoS has the same value, w0, as the present epoch for FSLLI and w0 + w1 for FSLLII.
Using Eqs. (10)-(11) to solve Eq. (3) leads to:

• Sendra-Lazkoz (SeLa, Sendra & Lazkoz 2012) improved the CPL parameterization, whose w0 − w1 parameters
are highly correlated and w1 is poorly constrained by the observational data, introducing new polynomial pa-
rameterizations. They are constructed to reduce the parameter correlation, so they can be better constrained
by the observations at low redshifts. One of these parameterizations is given by:

w(z) = −1 + c1

(13)

where the constants are deﬁned as c1 = (16w0 − 9w0.5 + 7)/4, and c2 = −3w0 + (9w0.5 − 3)/4, and w0.5 is the
value of the EoS at z = 0.5. This w(z) function is well-behaved at higher redshifts as (−1 − 8w0 + 9w0.5)/2. By
the substitution of Eq. (13) into Eq. (3), we obtain:

fde(z) = (1 + z)

(cid:21)

.

(14)

By replacing the fde(z) functions in Eq. (1), we obtain an analytical E(z) function for each parametric w(z), which
will be used in the following sections to estimate the EoS parameters. Our main purpose is to examine the quality of
the w(z) constraints extracted from the SL modeling when diﬀerent image-position errors are considered.

3. METHODOLOGY

3.1. Strong lensing as a cosmological probe

The gravitational lensing eﬀect is produced when the light-beam of a background source is deﬂected by a gravita-
tional lens, i.e. a mass distribution between the source and the observer. We refer to the strong lensing regime when
several rings, arcs or multiples images are observed as a result of the distortion and deﬂection of the light from a
source by a lens. These strong lensing observables oﬀer a powerful and useful tool to not only infer the total matter
distribution in astrophysical systems (Jauzac et al. 2014; Monna et al. 2017), but also to provide insights on the total
content of the Universe, dark matter and dark energy properties (Golse et al. 2002; Soucail et al. 2004; Jullo et al.
2010; Caminha et al. 2016; Maga˜na et al. 2015). Here, we use strong lensing measurements in galaxy clusters to
constrain the equation of state of parametric dark energy models.

Since the strong lensing features depend on the dynamics of the Universe via the angular diameter distance between
the source, lens and observer, it can be used as a geometric cosmological probe. For any underlying cosmology, the
angular diameter distance ratios for two images from diﬀerent sources deﬁnes the ’family ratio’ (see Jullo et al. 2010,
for a detailed discussion):

Ξ(z1, zs1, zs2, Θ) =

D(z1, zs1)
D(0, zs1)

D(0, zs2)
D(z1, zs2)

,

(15)

where Θ is the vector of cosmological parameters to be ﬁtted, z1 is the lens redshift, zs1 and zs2 are the two source
redshifts, and D(zi, zf ) is the angular diameter distance calculated as:

D(zi, zf ) =

r(zi, zf )
(1 + zf )

,

(16)

where r(zi, zf ), the comoving distance of a source at redshift zf measured by an observer at redshift zi, is given by

r(zi, zf ) =

c
H0

(cid:90) zf

zi

dz(cid:48)
E(z(cid:48))

.

(17)

Notice that the underlying cosmology in the lens modeling is selected by introducing the E(z) function in the
Eq. (17). For the parametric DE models, these functions are analytical and Θ = {Ωm, w0, w1} (w0.5 for the SeLa
parameterization) is the free parameter vector.

3.2. Lensing modeling

To constrain the parameters of the DE models presented in 2.1, we use the SL measurements in two galaxy clusters:
a real one, Abell 1689, and a simulated one, Ares from the Frontier Fields Comparison Challenge (Meneghetti et al.
2016).
We performed the SL modeling using the public software LENSTOOL3 (Kneib et al. 1996; Jullo et al. 2007) in which
the DE cosmological models described in 2.1 were implemented. LENSTOOL is a ray-tracing code with a Bayesian
Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampler which optimizes the model parameters using the positions of the multiply imaged
systems. The matter distribution in clusters is modeled in a parametric way and the optimization is performed in the
image plane for Abell 1689 as it is more precise (this is diﬀerent from the analysis by Jullo et al. 2010; Maga˜na et al.

3 https://projets.lam.fr/projects/lenstool

6

2015, where the optimization was performed in the source plane). For Ares, the optimization was realized in the source
plane as it is a more complex cluster (more images and cluster members) and this procedure is more computationally
eﬃcient. We checked that results in the image plane were similar for a subset of calculations.

For both Abell 1689 and Ares, each potential (either large or galaxy-scale) is parametrized with the Pseudo Isothermal
Elliptical Mass Distribution proﬁle (hereafter PIEMD, Kassiola & Kovner 1993; El´ıasd´ottir et al. 2007). The density
distribution of this proﬁle is given by:

ρ(r) =

ρ0
2 )(1 + r2
rcut

,

(1 + r2
rcore
with a central density ρ0, a core radius rcore and a truncation radius rcut. This proﬁle is characterized by two changes
in the density slope: it behaves as an isothermal proﬁle within the transition region but the density falls as ρ ∝ r−4
at large radii.
In LENSTOOL, it has the following free parameters: the coordinates x, y; the ellipticity, e; angle
position, θ; core and cut radii, rcore and rcut and a velocity dispersion, σ. Both clusters were modeled in the same
way regardless of the considered DE cosmological model.

2 )

(18)

Abell 1689.- a massive cluster at redshift z = 0.18, is one of the most studied strong lenses (see e.g., Limousin et al.
2007, 2013; Umetsu et al. 2015; Diego et al. 2015, and references therein). The ﬁrst SL modeling was performed by
Miralda-Escude & Babul (1995) which already required a bi-modal mass distribution for the cluster. It is one of the
most X-ray luminous clusters and has a large Einstein radii, ∼ 45(cid:48)(cid:48). A1689 is still the target of recent observations,
using MUSE data with which Bina et al. (2016) conﬁrmed or spectroscopically identiﬁed new multiples images as well
as cluster members.

We refer the reader to Jullo et al. (2010) for a detailed discussion of the modeling of A1689, where a SL parametric
model was used to constrain the DE EoS. As we follow-up their approach, we give here a quick overview. Abell 1689
was modeled using the SL features in the deep HST observations and extensive ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.
The mass distribution was represented as bi-modal, with one central and dominant large-scale potential harboring a
brightest central cluster galaxy (BCG) in its centre. The second large-scale potential was situated in the north-east.
Jullo et al. (2010) used 58 cluster galaxies (with mK < 18.11) in the modeling and followed the standard scaling
relations. In this work we consider the same catalog as in Jullo et al. (2010), including 28 images from 12 families4,
all with measured spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range of 1.15 < zS < 4.86.

Ares.- a mock galaxy cluster at z = 0.5, generated in a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmological model with a matter density
parameter Ωm = 0.272. We model Ares considering all multiple images (242 from 85 sources), all with assumed known
spectroscopic redshifts spanning a wide range (0.91 < zS < 6.0). Cluster members are taken from the given simulated
catalogue up to a magnitude of mF 160W < 22.0 mag (representing > 90% of the total cluster luminosity). Ares is part
of an archive of mock clusters which reproduce the characteristics of the Frontier Fields observations (the FF-SIMS
Challenge, Meneghetti et al. 2016). It was part of a challenge among the strong lensing community to perform, ﬁrst
a blind reconstruction of the mass distribution of the cluster, and then to improve the models after the unblinding
of the true mass distribution. The conclusions of this challenge were primarily used to calibrate diﬀerent modeling
techniques. Ares is a semi-analytical cluster created with MOKA5 by Giocoli et al. (2012). This simulated cluster,
a bimodal and realistic cluster, is built with three components: two smooth dark matter triaxial haloes, two bright
central cluster galaxies (BCGs) and a large number of sub-haloes. Dark matter sub-haloes are populated using a Halo
Occupation Distribution technique (HOD) and stellar and B-band luminosities are given for all galaxies according to
the mass of their sub-halo as in Wang et al. (2006).
We have modeled Ares as two large-scale potentials and two potentials for the BCGs, whose coordinates are ﬁxed
as well as the ones for the large-scale potentials (see Figure 1 in Acebron et al. 2017). Both components have been
parametrized with the PIEMD density proﬁle and corresponds to the model PIEMD - PIEMD in Acebron et al. (2017).
The modeling also includes cluster galaxies with mF 160W < 22 mag (being a more complex cluster, computing time is
reduced by introducing a magnitude cut representing > 90% of the total cluster luminosity) with masses scaling with

luminosity (see Limousin et al. 2005, for further details). Three massive cluster galaxies close to multiple images (see
Figure 1 in Acebron et al. 2017) were more carefully modeled (i.e their parameters deviate from the scaling relations).
All multiple images provided were taken into account in the modeling, resulting in an average positional accuracy of
0.66(cid:48)(cid:48) and giving tight constraints on the ΩM − w space parameter considering a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology .

To quantify how the cosmological constraints are biased due to systematic eﬀects in the SL modeling, we use diﬀerent
image-positional errors, δpos, and compare the resulting DE parameter estimations. For each parametric DE model
and for both Abell 1689 and Ares, we carry out three runs considering the following errors for the multiple images
positions: 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), and 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48). These values are chosen arbitrarily but they intend to cover the range of values
of systematic uncertainties reported by diﬀerent authors (Zitrin et al. 2015; Harvey et al. 2016). For instance, the
observations indicate uncertainties on the image positions ∼ 0.06(cid:48)(cid:48) (Grillo et al. 2015, see also Chiriv`ı et al. 2018) which
is almost one order of magnitude less that our smaller error. Nevertheless, the same authors increase this error in the
modeling up to six times, i.e 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48), to take into account systematics due to the LOS structures and small dark-matter
clumps. Although an error of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) is in agreement with predictions of the eﬀects of matter density ﬂuctuations along
the LOS (Host 2012; Caminha et al. 2016), other authors claim that 1.4(cid:48)(cid:48) is the reasonable error to account for these
systematics in lens modeling (e.g. Zitrin et al. 2012). Finally, Chiriv`ı et al. (2018) proposed to use diﬀerent errors in
the range 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48)-0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) for diﬀerent images. In order to consider all these possible eﬀects, we propose 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48) as minimum
error in the position of images and increase it two times in each run.

The best-ﬁtting model parameters are found by minimizing the distance between the observed and model-predicted

positions of the multiple images. To assess the goodness of the lens model ﬁt we examine the reduced chi-square χ2
red
(see Jullo et al. 2007, for details how it is calculated in the source and image plane). We also use the root-mean-square
between the observed and predicted positions of the multiple images from the modeling, computed as follows:

number of images. Although both estimators are widely used to compare the goodness-of-ﬁt of the cluster parameters
among diﬀerent lens models (e.g. Jullo et al. 2010; Limousin et al. 2016; Caminha et al. 2016), they are less sensitive
to the cosmological parameters. A reliable tool to measure the goodness of ﬁt for the cosmological constraints is the
Figure-of-Merit (FOM, Wang 2008) given by

FoM =

1
(cid:112)det Cov(f 1, f 2, f 3, ...)

,

(20)

where Cov(f 1, f 2, f 3, ...) is the covariance matrix of the cosmological parameters fi. This indicator (Eq. 20) is
a generalization of those proposed by Albrecht et al. (2006) and larger values imply stronger constraints on the
cosmological parameters since it corresponds to a smaller error ellipse.

4. RESULTS

In this section we present, for each cosmological model, the constraints from the strong lensing measurements of Ares
and Abell 1689, as well as those from other complementary probes (H(z), SNe Ia, BAO, and CMB, see Appendix A).
The mock Ares cluster has the advantage of being able to directly compare and validate the cosmological constraints
from the SL technique with the ﬁducial cosmology i.e. the ΛCDM with Ωm = 0.272.
For each cosmological model, the cluster model parameters and the cosmological parameters are simultaneously op-
timized with the LENSTOOL software with 80000 MCMC steps. For the complementary probes, we carry out the
EMCEE python module (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) employing 500 walkers, 2500 burn-in phase steps, and 7500
MCMC steps to guaranty the convergence. In all our estimations, we have adopted a dimensionless Hubble constant
h = 0.70.
Tables 1-6 show the mean parameters obtained after optimization for both Abell 1689, Ares and each cosmological
model (JBP, BA, FSLL I, FSLL II, and SeLa). For each positional uncertainty considered, we present the χ2
red, the
RMS in the image plane as well as the mean values obtained for the cosmological parameters ﬁtted, Ωm, w0 and w1
with the 68% uncertainties. The same Tables also give the mean values for the DE parameters obtained from the
complementary probes. The best ﬁt and 2D conﬁdence contours for the cosmological parameters were computed using

8

the python module Getdist6.

4.1. Eﬀect of image-position error on the cosmological parameters

The positional error for the multiple images plays a key role in both the lens modeling and the cosmological parameter

estimation (Limousin et al. 2016; Maga˜na et al. 2015; Caminha et al. 2016).

As mentioned in §1, a large error could take into account other sources of uncertainties in the SL measurements, such
as systematic errors due to foreground and background structures (D’Aloisio & Natarajan 2011; Host 2012; Bayliss
et al. 2014; Zitrin et al. 2015) or the cluster’s environment (McCully et al. 2017; Acebron et al. 2017). As a ﬁrst
test, we constrain the JBP cosmological parameters from Ares SL data with an image positional error δpos = 1(cid:48)(cid:48). For
red = 0.77 and RMS = 0.94(cid:48)(cid:48), both criteria indicating a good-ﬁt for the cluster
this run (see Table 1), we obtain χ2
parameters. When modeling Ares using smaller positional uncertainties (δpos = 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)), the χ2
red values point out
a poor model ﬁt. The left panel of Figure 1 illustrates the comparison of the Ωm − w0 conﬁdence contours obtained
with the diﬀerent positional uncertainties for the JBP model using Ares SL data. This Figure clearly shows that
increasing the positional uncertainty is translated in an enlargement of the conﬁdence contours and a systematic shift
in the Ωm0 estimation towards the ﬁducial value.

However, the χ2 statistical estimator also depends on the uncertainty considered for the position of the multiple
images. Thus, the change in the shape of the conﬁdence contours at 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48) could be explained by the underestimation of
the image position uncertainties. For instance, Acebron et al. (2017) measure an average positional accuracy of 0.66(cid:48)(cid:48)
for Ares using a strong lens model under the standard cosmology. Therefore, in the case of our w(z) parametrizations,
we would expect reasonable Ares models when the image position errors are roughly similar to the average positional
accuracy obtained (i.e. ∼ 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) − 1(cid:48)(cid:48)). We conﬁrm that more statistically signiﬁcant constraints for the lens (cluster)
model are obtained for larger errors, i.e., the reduced χ2
red value trending to one. This same trend is recovered for the
JBP, FSLL I, FSLL II and SeLa parameterizations (see Tables 2-6).

The main indicator for the quality of the cosmological constraints is provided by the FOM values. Although there
is not a clear tendency FOM vs. δpos, the strong constraints for the BA, FSLL I, FSLL II and SeLa parameters are
obtained when δpos = 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48). However, this uncertainty can lead to a poor cluster model. Moreover, this error provide
SL conﬁdence contours only consistent within the 3σ conﬁdence levels with those obtained from the other cosmological
tests. The optimum ﬁt is obtained as a compromise between those χred and RMS values that provide a good lens
model and the FOM value that gives cosmological constraints that are also in agreement with other probes. Thus, in
the following, we discuss the parameter estimation for the case in which those criteria are fulﬁlled (i.e. δpos = 1(cid:48)(cid:48), see
Figure 4 and Appendix B).

4.2. w(z) parameter estimations from SL in Abell 1689

In general, for all models, we found that the SL technique using Abell 1689 data provides better Ωm constraints than
the ones on the equation of state parameters and conﬁrm our previous result: a larger error (δpos = 1(cid:48)(cid:48)) provides more
signiﬁcant constraints for the cluster parameters, i.e. χred ∼ 1, and reasonable RMS values. As in the Ares case, the
right panel of the Figure 1 shows that increasing δpos is translated into an enlargement of the conﬁdence contours and
a systematic shift in the Ωm0 estimation towards the ﬁducial value. In addition, although this uncertainty produce the
lowest FOM values (i.e. less signiﬁcant cosmological parameters) for all w(z) parametrizations, the conﬁdence contours
are in complete agreement with those of the other probes. The Figures 2-4 show the 1σ, 2σ, 3σ conﬁdence contours and
the marginalized 1-dimensional posterior probability distributions on the Ωm, w0, w1 parameters for the cosmological
model JBP using Abell 1689 SL data for each positional uncertainty considered. We note again that, when the error
in the image position is increased, the Ωm − w0 and Ωm − w1 (or w0 − w1) conﬁdence contours shift towards the left
(upper) region, where the conﬁdence contours from BAO, CMB, SNe Ia, and H(z) probes are overlapped. This same
trend is recovered for the BA, FSLL I, FSLL II and SeLa parameterizations (their conﬁdence contours are provided
in the Figs. B1-B4 of the Appendix B).

On the other hand, the w0 and w1 mean values for the ﬁve w(z) parameterizations could suggest a dynamical equation
of state, which can be associated to thawing or freezing quintessence DE (Pantazis et al. 2016). Nevertheless, all our
EoS constraints are consistent with the cosmological constant, i.e. w0 = −1, and w1 = 0, within the 3σ conﬁdence level.
In addition, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the χ2
red and RMS values for diﬀerent w(z) parameterizations.
Therefore, any parametric DE model could be the source of the late cosmic acceleration. We conﬁrm this result in

respectively.

using the mean values obtained from the SL modeling in Abell 1689 when δpos = 1(cid:48)(cid:48) is considered.

4.3. Deceleration parameter

The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter (Eq. 5) is an important test to know whether a DE model
is able to handle the late cosmic acceleration. The right panels of Figure 5 shows the reconstructed q(z) evolution for
each parameterization obtained from Abell 1689 SL data when the multiple image-positional error is 1(cid:48)(cid:48). We also have
propagated its error within the 1σ conﬁdence level using a Monte Carlo approach. Notice that the ﬁve cosmological
models predict an accelerating expansion at late times. The transition redshifts, i.e. when the Universe passes from
an decelerated phase to one accelerated, are zt = 0.44+0.21
−0.04 for the JBP, BA,
FSLL I, FSLL II, and SeLa parameterizations, respectively. Furthermore, the q(z) shape for each parameterization is
consistent with that of the cosmological constant within the 1σ conﬁdence level.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Several recent studies have shown that dark energy could deviate from a cosmological constant (Ferreira et al. 2017;
Zhao et al. 2017). A simple way to investigate such alternative dark energy models is to parameterize the dark energy
equation of state as a function of redshift. In order to elucidate the nature of dark energy, numerous parameterizations
have been proposed (see for instance Pantazis et al. 2016, and references therein). The typical tests to constrain
cosmological parameters use SNe Ia, H(z), BAO and CMB distance posterior measurements. Nevertheless, some
of them could provide biased constraints because either the data or the test ﬁtting formulae are derived assuming
an underlying standard cosmology (see Appendix A). Furthermore, new complementary techniques could break the
degeneracy between parameters and obtain stringent constraints which could help us distinguish the nature of dark
energy.

In this paper, which is the ﬁrst in a series, we investigate a promising technique to study alternative cosmological
models and to constrain their parameters using the strong lensing features in galaxy clusters. This method has the
advantage of providing constraints which are not biased due to an underlying cosmology.

We have considered the following ﬁve popular bi-parametric CPL-like ansatz: JBP, BA, FSLL I, FSLL II, and SeLa
and constrained their parameters using the SL data in a real galaxy cluster, Abell 1689, and a simulated one Ares. We
implemented these w(z) parameterizations in the LENSTOOL code which uses a MCMC algorithm to simultaneously

constrain the lens model and the w(z) parameters. In addition, we have considered three diﬀerent image-positional
errors to quantify how the cosmological constraints are aﬀected by these uncertainties in the lens modeling. In general,
we found that the SL technique provides competitive constraints on the w(z) parameters in comparison with the
common cosmological tests. Moreover, when increasing the image-positional error (from 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48)), we ﬁnd that
systematic biases with respect to the known input cosmological values in the simulated cluster decrease. After taking
this calibration into account in the real data, our SL constraints are consistent with those obtained from other probes.
In summary, we have exploited the strong lensing modeling in galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe. Although
we have measured competitive constraints on the w(z) parameters, further analysis on the galaxy clusters and their
environment is needed to improve the strong lensing modeling and hence to more tightly estimate cosmological pa-
rameters. In forthcoming papers, we will test this method to constrain the parameter of other cosmological scenarios,
for instance, those considering interactions in the dark sector.

A. ADDITIONAL COSMOLOGICAL DATA

We compare the constraints obtained from the strong lensing modeling with those from BAO, CMB, SNe Ia and
H(z) cosmological probes. In the following we describe brieﬂy these cosmological data, for further details on how their
ﬁgure-of-merit is constructed see Maga˜na et al. (2015); Maga˜na et al. (2017) and references therein.

A.1. BAO

Large-scale galaxy surveys oﬀer the possibility of measuring the signature of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations which is
a typical length scale imprinted in both photons and baryons by the propagation of sound waves in the primordial
plasma of the Universe. This signal, i.e. the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rs(zd), is a standard ruler which can
be used to test alternative cosmologies. To complement our SL constraints, we use the following 9 BAO points (see
Maga˜na et al. 2017, and references therein)to constrain the w(z) functions:

• 6dFGS.- z = 0.106, dz ≡ rs(zd)

DV (z) = 0.336 ± 0.015, where DV (z) = 1
H0

(cid:104)

(1 + z)2D(z)2 cz
E(z)

(cid:105)1/3

• WiggleZ.- z = [0.44, 0.6, 0.73], dz = [0.0870 ± 0.0042, 0.0672 ± 0.0031, 0.0593 ± 0.0020]

• SDSS DR7 z = 0.15, 0.2239 ± 0.0084

• SDSS-III BOSS DR11 (a).- z = [0.32, 57], dz = [0.1181 ± 0.0022, 0.0726 ± 0.0007]

• SDSS-III BOSS DR11 (b).- z = [2.34, 2.36], DH (z)

rs(zd) = [9.18 ± 0.28, 9.00 ± 0.3], where DH(z) = c/H0E(z)

It is worth noting that rs(zd) depends on the underlying cosmology which is commonly the ΛCDM model. Moreover,
the zd formulae employed in the BAO ﬁtting (Eisenstein & Hu 1998) were calculated for the standard cosmology. Thus,
the BAO constraints could be biased due to the standard cosmology.

A.2. Distance posteriors from CMB Planck 2015 measurements

The information of the CMB acoustic peaks can be compressed in three quantities, their distance posteriors: the
acoustic scale, lA, the shift parameter, R, and the decoupling redshift, z∗. Several authors have proved that these
quantities are almost independent of the input DE models (Wang et al. 2012). Thus, to constrain the w(z) param-
eters we use the following distance posteriors for a ﬂat wCDM, estimated by Neveu et al. (2017) from Planck 2015
measurements: lobs

A = 301.787 ± 0.089, Robs = 1.7492 ± 0.0049, zobs

∗ = 1089.99 ± 0.29.

parameters as constrained by Planck Collaboration et al. (2016b) for a ΛCDM cosmology.

It is worth noting that the ﬁtting formulae for these quantities (Hu & Sugiyama 1996; Bond et al. 1997) are calculated

for the standard model, however we assume that they are valid in dynamical DE models.

A.3. SNe Ia

Since that Type Ia Supernovae are standard candles, i.e. their light curves have the same shape after a standardization
process, they have been used to measure cosmological parameters. Indeed, the apparent cosmic accelerating expansion
was observed through a Hubble diagram of distant SNIa. As complementary test, we consider the compilation by
Ganeshalingam et al. (2013) which contains 586 data points of the modulus distance, µ, in the redshift range 0.01 <
z < 1.4 which include mainly 91 points from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) SN Ia observations.

A.4. H(z) measurements

The Hubble parameter at diﬀerent redshifts provide a direct measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe.
Several authors have estimated the observational Hubble data using diﬀerent techniques:
from clustering or BAO
peaks (see for instance, Gaztanaga et al. 2009) and from cosmic chronometers (Jimenez & Loeb 2002). Here, we use
the same sample used by Maga˜na et al. (2017) which contains 34 data points in the redshift range 0.07 < z < 2.36.

parameters as constrained by Planck Collaboration et al. (2016b) for a ΛCDM cosmology.

Although some of the H(z) points were estimated from BAO data, we assume that there is no correlation between
them.
It is worth noting that the H(z) points obtained from BAO could yield to biased constraints due to the
underlying (ΛCDM) cosmology on rs(zd).
