Abstract: PyNeb is a Python package widely used to model emission lines in gaseous nebulae. We take
advantage of its object-oriented architecture, class methods, and historical atomic database to structure a
practical environment for atomic data assessment. Our aim is to reduce the uncertainties in the parameter
space (line ratio diagnostics, electron density and temperature, and ionic abundances) arising from the
underlying atomic data by critically selecting the PyNeb default datasets. We evaluate the questioned
radiative-rate accuracy of the collisionally excited forbidden lines of the N- and P-like ions (O II, Ne IV,
S II, Cl III, and Ar IV), which are used as density diagnostics. With the aid of observed line ratios in the
dense NGC 7027 planetary nebula and careful data analysis, we arrive at emissivity ratio uncertainties
from the radiative rates within 10%, a considerable improvement over a previously predicted 50%. We
also examine the accuracy of an extensive dataset of electron-impact effective collision strengths for
the carbon isoelectronic sequence recently published. By estimating the impact of the new data on the
pivotal [N II] and [O III] temperature diagnostics and by benchmarking the collision strength with a
measured resonance position, we question their usefulness in nebular modeling. We conﬁrm that the
effective-collision-strength scatter of selected datasets for these two ions does not lead to uncertainties in
the temperature diagnostics larger than 10%.

1. Introduction

PyNeb1 [1,2] is a Python package for the analysis of emission lines in gaseous nebulae, namely H II
regions and planetary nebulae. These lines are used to diagnose the nebular plasma conditions (typical
electron densities ne ∼ 10−105 cm−3 and temperatures Te from a few thousand to tens of thousands
Kelvin) and to ultimately estimate chemical abundances. Due to reliable observations in the infrared,

optical, and ultraviolet and well-constrained plasma models, the ubiquitous galactic and extragalactic
nebulae have become abundance tracers of choice to study cosmic chemical evolution [3].

The atomic radiative and collisional rates in nebular models are mainly determined by computation,
where inherent theoretical difﬁculties and computational limitations compromise accuracy. For instance,
most collisionally excited lines are dipole forbidden or semi-forbidden (∆S (cid:54)= 0), for which the theoretical
A-values and collision strengths must take into account fundamental electron-correlation and relativistic
effects; additionally, for the forbidden transitions in particular, the collision strengths are dominated
by intricate series of resonances [4,5]. For radiative recombination lines, low-temperature dielectronic
recombination rates are also sensitive to near-threshold resonances, whose energy positions are model
dependent (e.g., LS vs. intermediate coupling ionic models) and lack experimental benchmarks [6]. It is
noteworthy that the development of the codes to calculate relativistic atomic structure and electron–ion
scattering has been in great part driven by the stringent requirements of these transition rates, which in
many cases are still to converge to the desirable accuracy despite large calculations [7]. With the intention
of promoting a ﬂuid and constructive interaction between atomic data producers and users in nebular
physics, for which we have well-recognized contributions [8,9], we have undertaken the present atomic
data assessment joint project.

The deep-seated dependence of nebular spectral models on the underlying atomic parameters has
encouraged the implementation of databases that have become standard references (e.g., [10,11]) or an
integral part of spectral modeling tools such as CHIANTI2 [12,13], CLOUDY3 [14], XSTAR4 [15], and PyNeb.
Regarding modeling codes, periodic atomic data curation (i.e., upgrading, selection, and assessment) has
become a major determinant of their usefulness, PyNeb having the distinctive advantage of keeping a
historical database with all the available radiative and collisional datasets rather than discarding data
when upgrading. This data-curation strategy allows modelers to estimate the uncertainties of the plasma
diagnostics and chemical abundances arising from the scatter of the atomic parameters and also provides
a suitable environment for atomic data assessment, the central topic of the present report. This capability
of the package is conceptually similar to AtomPy [11,16], but supported by a battery of class methods that
facilitate the data revision procedures.

2. PyNeb Package

The PyNeb Python package [2] is tailored to derive the nebular plasma conditions (electron
temperature and density) and relative chemical abundances by comparing observed line intensities
with computed emissivities, for which it provides a variety of extinction laws, ionization correction factors
(ICF), diagnostic plots, and Balmer/Paschen jump temperature determinations. Modules, documentation,
historic versions and logs, and notebooks can be accessed from the PyNeb GitHub repository5. The current
version used in this paper is 1.1.13.

For an nmax-level ionic model and a given electron temperature and density, PyNeb solves the
equilibrium equations to determine the level populations, critical densities, and line emissivities,
which lead to plasma diagnostics based on observed line ratios. For this purpose, it can upload and
manage observational datasets to ﬁnally obtain the ionic abundances and, by means of ICF, the elemental
abundances. Since the default atomic datasets can be readily changed and updated, the package furnishes
plots to compare the atomic parameters from different sources.

Since we are mainly concerned in this report with collisionally excited lines, we recall the basic
formalism used by PyNeb to compute the emissivities to derive abundances from such lines. Emissivities
for collisionally excited lines are obtained by solving the equations of statistical equilibrium for an
nmax-level ionic system:

∑
k(cid:54)=i

nenkqki + ∑
k>i

nk Aki = ∑
k(cid:54)=i

neniqik + ∑
k<i

ni Aik

(i = 1, nmax)

assuming that:

ni = ntot ,

∑
i

(1)

(2)

where ntot is the total ion density, ne the electron density, ni the level population of the ith level, and Aki
the radiative transition rate for levels k → i. The electron-impact de-excitation rate coefﬁcient qki is usually
expressed in terms of the effective collision strength Υ

ki(Te) as:

qki =

8.629 × 10−6
gk

Υ
ki(Te)
T1/2
e

(k > i)

(3)

gk being the statistical weight of the upper level. The excitation rate coefﬁcient can be obtained from the
detailed balance relation:

qik =

qki exp(−∆Eik/kBTe)

(k > i)

(4)

gk
gi

where exp(−∆Eik/kBTe) is the Boltzmann factor. It must be noted that for historic reasons [17], the effective
collision strength Υ
ki(E), is
often referred to in the nebular community simply as the collision strength Ω

ki(Te), i.e., the temperature-dependent Maxwell-averaged collision strength Ω

ki(Te).

The line emissivity is given by:

(cid:101)ki = nk Aki hc/λ ,

(5)

and for cospatial ions, the emissivity ratio of a pair of optically thin lines is equal to the line intensity
ratio, allowing the formulation of plasma diagnostics to determine the electron density and temperature.
Furthermore, for an ion Xa emitting a line with wavelength λ and intensity I(λ), it can be shown that:

n(Xa)
n(H+)

=

I(λ)
I(Hβ)

(cid:101)(Hβ)
(cid:101)(λ)

,

an expression that leads to the ionic abundance. The elemental abundance is then given by the sum:

n(X)
n(H)

= ∑
a

n(Xa)
n(H+)

= ∑
a(cid:48)

n(Xa(cid:48) )
n(H+)

× ICF

(6)

(7)

that assumes an ionization correction factor for the unseen ionic species (a(cid:48) being the set of observed ionic
species).

Figure 1 gives an outline of the PyNeb object-oriented architecture, where the ion object is represented
by the Atom and RecAtom classes. They offer a set of methods to determine the temperature and
density (getTemDen), emissivities (getEmissivity), and ionic abundances (getionAbundance) through
the atomicData manager. In the present work, we use the graphic methods of DataPlot to examine the
atomic data scatter. The RecAtom class computes emissivities for recombination lines by table interpolation
or a ﬁtting formula using eponymous methods to obtain the ionic abundance. Useful stacks of Te−Ne
emissivity grids can be generated with the emisGrid class and multi-diagnostic ratios with Diagnostics.

Astronomical observations are managed with the Observation class, and diagnostic plots can be devised
by means of the Observation, Diagnostics, and emisGrid classes.

Figure 1. Outline of the PyNeb object-oriented architecture showing its classes (name, some arguments, and
methods) and output products. For atomic data assessment, we employ the classes and data within the red
rectangle. The new Continuum class (added in Version 1.1.9) computes the nebular continuum (considering
two-photon, free–free, and free–bound emission processes) and the electron temperature associated with
the Balmer or Paschen jumps.

3. PyNeb Atomic Database

3.1. Data File Format

Earlier versions of PyNeb relied on data ﬁles structured under the FITS format [18,19] to comply with
the IRAF6 Nebular package. These FITS ﬁles are still included in the current distribution, but are no
longer used as default. Since 2014, a new ASCII format was adopted to allow the user easy access to
the raw data and the addition of new data if needed. The old FITS ﬁles have been transcribed to this
ASCII format, and new data are now incorporated in PyNeb only abiding this prescription. This format is
close to that of the stout [14] database of the CLOUDY photoionization code, PyNeb being able to write
its atomic data in stout format, but not always able to read from it (especially when different electron
temperature grids are used in a single ﬁle). All the ﬁles holding the atomic data are downloaded and saved
on the user’s disk when installing PyNeb; they can also be accessed from the GitHub repository under the
pyneb/atomic_data directory.

3.2. Energy Levels

5 of 25

A frequent issue when dealing with complex ions (e.g., Fe+ or Fe++) is to be able to compare the
atomic parameters corresponding to the same transition, which requires a unique list of energy levels. We
have therefore chosen to download the energy levels from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database7 and to sort
them in increasing energy order. This may not always correspond to the list of separate multiplets (see, for
instance, [20]) and involves the occasional data reordering to comply with the NIST energy-level order.
The user can access the NIST energy levels with the function (for O++, say):

pn.getLevelsNIST(’O3’)

3.3. Recombination Spectra for H and He

Recombination emissivities are read from the x_rec_ref.ext ﬁles, where x represents the ion and ref
the source reference acronym. The ext extension may be either func or hdf5; for the former, a numerical
function is used as in [21]. The data are read by the RecAtom class and interpolated in density and
temperature. Recently, recombination data for the heavier ions of C, O, N, and Ne have also been
incorporated into the PyNeb atomic database. For O++, the recombination data table from [22] is split into
infrared and optical–ultraviolet lines, and the A, B, and C cases are stored in separate ﬁles.

3.4. Collisional Spectra

For collisional spectra, PyNeb creates an nmax-level atom model characterized by the atomic data read
at runtime from the ﬂat ASCII ﬁles xxx_atom_ref.dat and xxx_coll_ref.dat, where xxx represents the ion
(e.g., “o_iii” for O++) and ref the source reference acronym. Transition probabilities Aki (s−1) are different
from zero only for k > i, so the data are ordered in a rectangular nmax × nmax matrix with zeroes along
and above the main diagonal. The atom ﬁles contain the following items:

•
•
•

Transition probabilities.
Information about the corresponding ion.
The data source reference.

The x_coll_ref.dat ﬁle contains the effective collision strengths (ECS) Υ

ki(Te), which are functions of
the electron temperature (i.e., a collective property of the electron distribution) obtained by averaging the
energy-dependent collision strengths Ω
ki(E) over a Maxwellian distribution of electron kinetic energies.
The ECS are usually published in tabular form for a handful of temperatures Te and must be
interpolated to get the Υ
ki(Te) at the desired Te value. Such a table is included in the data ﬁle, and since
for each transition k → i, the upper level k > i, there is a whole one-dimensional vector array of collision
strengths with one element for each tabulated temperature value; that is, the complete Υ set for an atom is
a three-dimensional array that prevents confusing the data in the matrix with the transition probabilities
(each transition is presented instead in a line). The temperature can be in Kelvin, log10(K), or K/10,000
depending on the particular dataset. The Υ
ki(Te) are interpolated linearly between the values at two
contiguous temperatures; a keyword can be used to invoke an alternative interpolation method depending
on what is available from the interpolate.interp1d function of the scipy library (e.g., “quadratic” or
“cubic”). The interpolation method has some second-order inﬂuence on the resulting ECS, and thus on the
emissivities.

The coll ﬁles contain the following quantities:

•
•
•

Electron-temperature values used for the grid.

Information about the corresponding ion (and the unit used for the electron temperature).

4. Data from CHIANTI

PyNeb can read the atomic data from the CHIANTI8 package (Versions 7, 8, and 9, the latter the latest
release; see [12,13]). The user needs the CHIANTI database installed beforehand on their computer and
the XUVTOP environment variable pointing to the corresponding directory. The CHIANTI data (namely,
level energies E, transition probabilities A, and ECS Υ(Te)) can be accessed using commands based on
Chiantipy routines included in the PyNeb package (for O++ at 10,000 K, say):

pn.utils.pn_chianti.Chianti_getA(’o_3’)
pn.utils.pn_chianti.Chianti_getOmega(’o_3’, tem = 1e4)

The correspondence between the NIST and CHIANTI level orders is obtained with the command:

pn.utils.pn_chianti.get_levs_order(’O3’, NLevels = 9)
-> {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 8, 7: 6, 8: 7}

where the ﬁrst number is the NIST index and the second the corresponding CHIANTI index. We can see
that Levels 7, 8, and 9 are not in the same order in both databases.

In CHIANTI, the effective collision strength is mapped onto a ﬁnite temperature interval (0, 1) with
the scaling relations of [23] and represented with a spline of ﬁve or more points. This ensures that a value
can be obtained at any temperature (0, ∞). From Version 8, the mapping onto the (0, 1) scaled temperature
interval is still used, but the stored points now correspond to the original data replacing the spline ﬁts by
interpolation. However, this only applies to new data; for the data already in the database, the 5-, 7-, or
9-point spline ﬁts are still used [24]; e.g., a 5-point spline for O++. Although this concise representation
may not always be accurate, e.g., at low temperatures [24], it has endured and has been extended to
neutral atoms and molecules [25]. In PyNeb, the original data are used. The extrapolation to low and high
temperatures is performed by reporting the lowest and highest value, respectively. The user can avoid
extrapolation by adding noExtrapolation = True when instantiating the Atom object; in this case, NaN
values are returned for temperatures outside of the original range.

5. Atomic Data File Management

Within the scope of PyNeb in atomic data assessment, we go over the perhaps unfamiliar but core
concept of the atomic data dictionary and its default value, the latter being the result of data selection
procedures we are hereby trying to reﬁne. We explain how to list the default and other dictionaries, the
dataset labels, and respective bibliographic references and how to construct bespoke dictionaries to devise
data comparisons.

5.1. Atomic Data Files

The collection of data ﬁles for the different ions used in a calculation is organized in a dictionary (in the
Python sense); i.e., a data structure with one or more entries such that each entry has a uniquely deﬁned key
and value. An atomic data dictionary is identiﬁed by a label, which can be either predeﬁned (i.e., built-in)

8

https://www.chiantidatabase.org/

Atoms 2020, xx, 5

7 of 25

or provided by the user; the keys are the ions, and the values specify the atomic data. More precisely, each
value is itself a dictionary with three possible keys, “atom”, “coll”, or “rec”, whose respective values are
the names of the atomic, collisional, or recombination data ﬁles.

The default dictionary of the current atomic database is obtained with the command:

pn.atomicData.defaultDict

At present, it matches ’PYNEB_20_01’, but it will change as new atomic data are published or our criteria
for selecting datasets evolves. The list of all the built-in atomic data labels is obtained with:

pn.atomicData.getAllPredefinedDict()

At the time of writing, 11 such dictionaries exist: ’IRAF_09_orig’, ’IRAF_09’, ’PYNEB_13_01’,
’PYNEB_14_01’, ’PYNEB_14_02’, ’PYNEB_14_03’, ’PYNEB_16_01’, ’PYNEB_17_01’, ’PYNEB_17_02’,
’PYNEB_18_01’, and ’PYNEB_20_01’. For the dictionary ’PYNEB_14_01’ and earlier, old FITS ﬁles are
used, and a special command must be run before using them: pn.atomicData.includeFitsPath(). The
old dictionaries are kept in PyNeb to guarantee backward compatibility, but users are strongly urged to use
the default and to quote the PyNeb version in publication. As an example, the entry corresponding to the
current O++ data is:

pn.atomicData.getDataFile(atom = ’O3’)

’o_iii_atom_FFT04-SZ00.dat’,
’o_iii_coll_SSB14.dat’,
’o_iii_rec_P91.func’

If no value (or None) is speciﬁed for the atom keyword, the list of the data ﬁles for all the ions of the current
conﬁguration is returned as a dictionary.

The bibliographic references of the atomic data in the default dictionary are displayed with:

pn.atomicData.printAllSources()

The bibliographic references of the atomic data used in a given dictionary labeled “label” (default or
other) can be displayed by entering:

pn.atomicData.printAllSources(predef = ’PYNEB_16_01’)

The bibliographic references of the atomic data used for just a subset of ions (e.g., O II, O III, and S II) can
be shown with:

pn.atomicData.printAllSources(at_set = [’O2’, ’O3’, ’S2’])

5.2. Changing an Individual Data File or the Whole Dataset

The data available for a given ion (e.g., O III) can be displayed by entering:

pn.atomicData.getAllAvailableFiles(’O3’)

[’* o_iii_atom_FFT04-SZ00.dat’,
’* o_iii_coll_SSB14.dat’,
’* o_iii_rec_P91.func’,
’o_iii_atom.chianti’,
’o_iii_atom_FFT04.dat’,

Atoms 2020, xx, 5

8 of 25

’o_iii_atom_GMZ97-WFD96.dat’,
’o_iii_atom_SZ00-WFD96.dat’,
’o_iii_atom_TFF01.dat’,
’o_iii_atom_TZ17.dat’,
’o_iii_coll.chianti’,
’o_iii_coll_AK99.dat’,
’o_iii_coll_LB94.dat’,
’o_iii_coll_MBZ20.dat’,
’o_iii_coll_Pal12-AK99.dat’,
’o_iii_coll_TZ17.dat’]

The data used to currently instantiate the Atom and RecAtom objects are identiﬁed with a leading asterisk
(*). The current ﬁle selection for a given ion can be modiﬁed, for example, with the commands:

pn.atomicData.setDataFile(’o_iii_atom_TZ17.dat’)
pn.atomicData.setDataFile(’o_iii_coll_TZ17.dat’)

The next instantiating of an Atom object for O++ will use these data ﬁles. It is then simple to instantiate
different Atom objects for the same ion with different atomic data to compare, for example, emissivities.

5.3. Deprecated Data

It may happen that at some point in the history of PyNeb, some atomic data ﬁles are removed from
the default directory where all the data are stored. This mainly occurs if the same data are deﬁned
in another ﬁle that takes better into account the original source of the atomic data; in this case, the
compilation is not used anymore (e.g., the data that used to be in the s_iii_atom_PKW09.dat ﬁle is now in
the s_iii_atom_FFTI06.dat ﬁle to cite the original paper). When this occurs, the obsolete ﬁle is sent to the
deprecated directory to ensure backward compatibility. If the user still prefers to have access to the data in
this directory, the command pn.atomicData.includeDeprecatedPath() is needed before permuting the
default data ﬁle with the deprecated one. Removing deprecated ﬁles from the accessible path is performed
with pn.atomicData.removeDeprecatedPath().

5.4. List of All the Data Used in a Script

Each time an Atom or a RecAtom object is instantiated, the data ﬁles used are stored in a dictionary
held by the atomicData object. After a script is run using PyNeb, the list of all the ﬁles can be obtained
using the pn.atomicData.usedFiles command. This helps the user cite the atomic data papers properly.

6. Continuum Class: Balmer and Paschen Jumps to Determine the Electron Temperature

Continuum is a new class in PyNeb (see Figure 1) devised to obtain alternative estimates of the electron
temperature. This is an important development as the temperatures derived from line diagnostics strongly
depend on the basic atomic database, whose accuracy is often questioned in the literature (e.g., [26]).

6.1. Nebular Continuum

The nebular continuum due to the following processes,

•
•
•

Free–bound emission from H+, He+, and He++ [27],
Free–free emission by H+, He+, and He++ [28],
Two-photon decay from 22S of H [17],

Atoms 2020, xx, 5

9 of 25

can be estimated with PyNeb. The prescription to obtain the continuum is: wavelength range;
electron temperature and density; and the He+/H+ and He++/H+ ionic abundances. The continuum is
given in erg s−1 cm−3Å−1 or in Å−1 when normalized to an H I line. The commands:

C = pn.core.continuum.Continuum()
C.get_continuum(tem = 1e4, den = 1e2, He1_H = 0.12, He2_H = 0.01,

wl = np.linspace(3500, 3900, 100), HI_label = ’11_2’)

give an example on how to compute the continuum normalized to H I 3770 Å for: Te = 104 K;
ne = 102 cm−3; He+/H+ = 0.12; and He++/H+ = 0.01 in the wavelength range 3500–3900 Å. The result
of this example is plotted in Figure 2. To get the continuum with no normalization, HI_label must be
deﬁned as None.

6.2. Balmer and Paschen Jump Temperatures

The electronic temperature from the Balmer (or Paschen) jump is determined by minimizing the
difference between the theoretical nebular continuum (described in Section 6.1) and the observed ﬂux
before and after the jump. The optimization is based on the Richard Brent algorithm for root-ﬁnding [29]
using scipy.optimize.brentq.

Figure 2. Nebular continuum normalized to H I 3770 Å. The data are obtained with the get_continuum
function of the Continuum class for Te = 104 K, ne = 102 cm−3, He+/H+ = 0.12, and He++/H+ = 0.01.

The temperature determination requires: the difference of the observed ﬂux (in Å−1) before and after
the jump normalized to a H I line; the corresponding wavelengths (predeﬁned at 3643 and 3861 Å); the
electron density; and the He+/H+ and He++/H+ ionic abundances. The following example uses the data
for the planetary nebula M 1-42 [30] normalized to H I 3770 Å and to Hβ:

The contributions from the stellar continuum and dust emission are not considered in the temperature
determination, although they can contribute to the observed ﬂux.

7. Atomic Data Assessment

A paradigmatic example of using PyNeb for atomic data assessment is [31], who analyzed the size of
the systematic uncertainties when using 52 different sets of transition probabilities and collision strengths
to calculate the physical conditions and total abundances of O, N, S, Ne, Cl, and Ar for a sample of
planetary nebulae and H II regions. These authors found that at low densities, the scatter in the abundance
ratios was lower than 0.1–0.2 dex9, but for densities ne > 104 cm−3, it can be larger than 0.6–0.8 dex
for several abundance ratios such as O/H and N/O. A narrower scatter was obtained by discarding
questionable atomic data, but a revision of the atomic data behind important density diagnostics was
recommended: the radiative transition probabilities (A-values) of O II, S II, Cl III, and Ar IV, as well as the
effective collision strengths for the latter.

In the last few years, there has been growing interest in determining chemical abundances in ionized
nebulae for the heavier elements nucleosynthesized by slow-neutron capture (the s-process). Encouraged
by several detections of s-process faint emission lines in planetary nebulae, several groups have been
computing the required atomic data; e.g., Rb IV [32]; Se III and Kr VI [33]; and Te III and Br V [34]. The
synergy between observations, atomic data calculations, and numerical modeling (needed to determine
ICF) has signiﬁcantly boosted this ﬁeld. All these atomic datasets for neutron-capture elements (energy
levels, transition probabilities, and collision strengths) have been incorporated in PyNeb, allowing, for the
ﬁrst time, total abundance estimates for Kr and Se by using the complete sets of ICF developed for these
elements by [33,34] using a private ad hoc version of CLOUDY.

The DataPlot class has several methods to plot the atomic datasets, which can be used to bring out

the data scatter and questionable outliers. For instance, the commands:

dp_O3=pn.DataPlot(’O’,3,NLevels = 5)
dp_O3.plotAllA(figsize = (10,8))

plot all the available A-values for O III as shown in Figure 3.

To further illustrate the possibilities of the PyNeb analysis tools in atomic data assessment, we discuss

in the next sections two relevant study cases.

7.1. A-Values for N- and P-Like Ions

We address here one of the atomic data queries raised by [31]: the radiative rates for the N-like (O II
and Ne IV) and P-like (S II, Cl III, and Ar IV) systems, which are widely used to devise nebular density
diagnostics. These are ionic species with ns2np3 ground conﬁguration (n = 2 for N-like and n = 3 for
P-like), the line ratio of interest being the 2Do

3/2 doublet. Figure 4 shows the energy-level

correlation effects, and some include corrections to the magnetic dipole operator and level energy
separations to increase accuracy. Signiﬁcant discrepancies due to the A-value choice begin to appear at
electron densities log(ne) (cid:38) 2 cm−3, and most grow with density until R1 is reached. For both O II and
Ne IV, the emissivity-ratio uncertainties from the radiative data are no larger than 25% along the entire
density range.

A further measure of A-value accuracy can be carried out in terms of the R1 A-value ratio and a
benchmark with the observed line ratios from the high-density NGC 7027 planetary nebula [41] as listed in
Table 1. The overall agreement between the theoretical R1 ratios is around the 15% level. Interestingly, the
more recent calculations (CQL07 [42], HGZJYL14 [43], and HLZSZ18 [44]) have focused A(2Do

to constrain R1 using a fully relativistic multi-conﬁguration Dirac–Fock (MCDF) method with convergent
conﬁguration-interaction expansions, which includes the Breit interaction and QED effects. Although the
R1 from these calculations is within the general scatter, the absolute A(2Do

calculations are somewhat larger than previous estimates.

It may be seen in Table 1 that the observed [O II] line ratio is in good agreement with the theoretical R1
values, while in Ne IV, it is noticeably higher, implying that the high-density regime for this latter diagnostic
has not been reached in NGC 7027, and it can therefore be used to obtain the electron density. We deduce
an electron density of log(ne) = 4.7 ± 0.1 cm−3 at Te = 104 K using the Z82, GFF84, BBZ89, MMKV99,
and FFT04 datasets, giving an estimate of the impact of the atomic data scatter on the density diagnostic,
namely 0.1 dex. Since one of the main objectives of the present work is to select default atomic datasets in
PyNeb, we singled out Z82 and GFF84 for both O II and Ne IV after much pondering to ensure line ratio
diagnostics within 10%. For this purpose, we applied the following selection criteria:

•
•

Datasets must contain all the transitions within the ground conﬁguration with at least ∆L (cid:54)= 0.
For consistency, datasets considering isoelectronic sequences are preferred to those focusing on
single species.

• Wavelength adjusted A-values computed with correct transition operators (e.g., magnetic dipole)

•
•

have priority.
Emissivity ratios must lie within a 10% scatter along the isoelectronic sequence.
The dataset must comply with the condition of Equation (10), and R1 must lie within a 10%
theoretical scatter.

• A selected dataset must be validated with data computed independently with a different

numerical method.

Among the Z82, GFF84, BBZ89, MMKV99, and FFT04 datasets, only the ﬁrst two comply with these
selection criteria.

We repeat this data assessment procedure with the ionic species of the P isoelectronic sequence of

[49], IFF05 [50], FFT06 [51], TZ10 [52], KKFBL14 [53], and RGJ19 [54] A-value datasets relative to MZ82
[55]. Similar to the N-like ions, the overall agreement is around the 25% level, but if we exclude the three
datasets FFG86, TZ10, and KKFBL14 in S II (see Figure 6 left panel), the agreement is better than 10%. The
emissivity ratio discrepancies from the fully relativistic (MCDF) Fal99 and RGJ19 datasets relative to MZ82
are puzzling and not explained in [54]: for the former, they increase with atomic number Z up to 15% in
Ar IV, while in the latter they remain within 5% throughout the isoelectronic sequence (see all panels of
Figure 6).

In Table 2, we compare the theoretical R1 for the three ions with the line ratios observed in NGC 7027.
If we again exclude FFG86, TZ10, and KKFBL14, we ﬁnd excellent agreement in S II. Assuming the
A-value scatter, the predicted electron densities for Cl III and Ar IV are log(ne) = 4.76 ± 0.08 cm−3 and
log(ne) = 4.73 ± 0.06 cm−3, respectively; i.e., within 0.1 dex. From these comparisons and following our
selection criteria, we conﬁdently single out the recent RGJ19 dataset [54] as the PyNeb default to ensure a
line ratio with an uncertainty from the radiative data better than 10%. The PYNEB_20_01 dictionary with
the PyNeb default values adopts these datasets.

7.2. Effective Collision Strengths for C-Like Ions

The present evaluation of the ECS for ions of the carbon isoelectronic sequence is motivated on the
one hand by the leading role of their temperature diagnostics in nebular modeling and on the other by
the worrisome discrepancies resulting when using an extensive ECS dataset for C-like ions (7 ≤ Z ≤ 36)
recently published (MBZ20 [56]). In Figure 7, we plot the percentage difference of the [N II] 5755/6584
and [O III] 4363/5007 emissivity ratios using the ECS from the LB94 [57], HB04 [58], and MBZ20 datasets
relative to T11 [59] (default) for the former and from LB94, AK99 [60], Pal12-AK99 [61], TZ17 [62], and
MBZ20 relative to SSB14 [63] (default) for the latter. While the accord of LB94, AK99, and TZ17 with SSB14
for O III and of LB94 and HB04 with T11 for N II is well within 10% for both species, MBZ20 shows large
discrepancies: as high as −50% in O III and +30% in N II. As

[N II] 5755/6584 (right panel) computed at ne = 103 cm−3. For [O III], we compare the ratios obtained
when using the SSB14 default ECS [63] with other datasets; for [N II], the default ECS are T11 [59]. Data
provenance is: LB94 [57]; AK99 [60]; HB04 [58]; Pal12 [61]; TZ17 [62]; and MBZ20 [56].

also shown in Figure 7 (left panel), the emissivity ratio resulting from the Pal12-AK99 ECS for O III is
∼25% higher and is caused by their neglecting the 2p4kl free channels in the close-coupling expansion of
the ion–electron system that leads to an energy downshift of the broad 2p5 resonance [63].

The large discrepancies in the emissivity ratios originating from the MBZ20 ECS are of concern and
demand further analysis. For instance, in Figure 8, we plot the temperature differences when using
MBZ20 relative to the default ECS datasets: for a set of temperatures and densities, we compute the
diagnostic line ratios [N II] 5755/6584 and [O III] 4363/5007, and from them, we compute back the electron
temperature determined using MBZ20. Te(N II) is underestimated by as much as 1.6 kK at 14 kK, while
Te(O III) is overestimated by 0.8 kK. This temperature divergence may have a signiﬁcant impact on the
ionic abundances since Te(N II) is used in nebular models for the singly ionized species (N+, O+, and S+),
while Te(O III) is used for O++, Ar++, and S++.

Figure 9. Abundance logarithmic differences for several ions caused by using the MBZ20 ECS relative to
the PyNeb defaults.

In Figure 9, we show the resulting abundance logarithmic differences: we compute the emissivities
of the emission lines with the PyNeb default atomic data and then use them to compute back the ionic
abundances with MBZ20. They are obtained at ﬁve electron densities (10, 100, 1000, 3000, and 10,000 cm−3)
from the following emission lines: [N II] 6584; [O II] 3726 + 29; [O III] 5007; [Ar III] 7135; [S II] 6716 + 31; and
[S III] 6312 and 9069. The differences (positive and negative) can be as large as 0.3 dex when considering
low or high ionization species. Depending on the global ionization of the nebula, the total abundance
may be underestimated (high-ionization nebulae) or overestimated (low-ionization nebulae) depending
on the dominant ionic stage of each element. For medium-ionization nebulae, the net result may be a
cancellation between both effects, leading to the same elemental abundances.

The DataPlot class offers a series of useful methods to plot the atomic data, which can be used to

revise the MBZ20 datasets for O III and N II:

dp_O3=pn.DataPlot(’O’,3,NLevels = 5)
dp_O3.plotOmega(figsize = (10,8))
dp_N2=pn.DataPlot(’N’,2,NLevels = 5)
dp_N2.plotOmega(figsize = (10,8))

the resulting plots being shown in Figures 10 and 11. For O III, it may be seen that the Ω(4, 1), Ω(4, 2),
and Ω(4, 3) ECS by MBZ20 corresponding to the transitions 2s22p2 1D2 − 3PJ are considerably larger in
the temperature region of interest (5 ≤ Te ≤ 20 kK). On the other hand, the situation in N II for these
transitions is the inverse: the MBZ20 ECS are now lower. The Ω(5, 4) from different datasets for both O III
and N II also displays incongruent behaviors. However, we underline that MBZ20 is the only dataset
offering ECS for temperatures log(Te) (cid:38) 5.5 K.

Figures 10 and 11 illustrate a recurrent problem in nebular modeling when dealing with ECS
tabulations. The temperature end-points and mesh intervals in each dataset vary, and they must be
somehow interpolated. In CHIANTI, the ECS are sometimes represented by ﬁve, six, or seven points, two
of which are assigned to Te = 0 and Te = ∞; thus, in real terms, the ﬁnite temperature range is reduced to
three, four, or ﬁve point spline ﬁts, which may result in further inaccuracies.

that “collision strengths” and Ω(k, i) in this ﬁgure stand for temperature-dependent ECS.

In Figure 12 (left panel), we plot the collision strength for the [O III] 1D2 − 3P0 transition computed
by MBZ20 and SSB14, which is dominated in the near-threshold region by a broad peak. In SSB14, this
peak is located at ≈0.29 Ryd, while in MBZ20, it downshifts to ≈0.22 Ryd, causing the ECS enhancement
shown in Figure 10. As discussed by [62], there is an experimental position for this peak at 0.294 Ryd
[64]; thus, the downshifted resonance position in MBZ20 is inaccurate. This peak is mainly caused by an
array of resonances with conﬁguration 2s2p33s, and their atomic structure does not represent these states
adequately. Moreover, the resonance structure in the two curves in the energy interval 0.35 ≤ E ≤ 0.55 Ryd
is also different (see Figure 12, left panel).

computed by SSB14 and MBZ20.

The Ω(5, 4) ECS in Figure 10 corresponds to the [O III] 1S0 − 1D2 transition, and the data by SSB14
and MBZ20 are also found to be discrepant in the temperature region of interest. As shown in Figure 12
(right panel), this discord is again caused by resonance positions, in this case the near-threshold 2p5
resonance that in MBZ20 is around 0.02 Ryd lower. Although this downshift is relatively smaller, the
resonance is closer to the threshold, making the ECS sensitive at low temperatures. Moreover, it is also
seen in Figure 10 that the Ω(5, 4) by MBZ20 and TZ17 are in agreement. We therefore predict that the
position of this resonance in TZ17 is also lower than in SSB14, and we would then be of the opinion that
the latter dataset is the most accurate and, therefore, the PyNeb default. Similar discrepancies are observed
in the Ω(5, 4) in N II (see Figure 11), which were discussed in [5] and need further evaluation.

8. Discussion and Conclusions

In the context of nebular modeling, we made use of the atomic data assessment capabilities of PyNeb
to revise the accuracy of the A-values for transitions within the ground conﬁguration of the N- and P-like
ions as suggested by [31] and the ECS for C-like species motivated by the recent publication of an extensive
dataset [56]. For atomic data evaluation, PyNeb offers two coveted features: a fairly complete historical
database of radiative and collisional parameters and a handy series of class methods to compare plasma
diagnostics and abundances using the different atomic datasets, which enable direct uncertainty estimates
in parameter space. As a result, we have been able to select for these isoelectronic sequences the reference
datasets to become the PyNeb defaults.

The magnitude and scatter of the lifetimes of the two S II 3s23p3 2Do

3/2,5/2 levels have been extensively
reviewed recently to propose a viable measurement scheme to improve their accuracy to better than
10% [65]. It was mentioned therein that a 10% lifetime uncertainty would lead to a 50% emissivity ratio
uncertainty and that the current theoretical scatter is larger than 10%. Due to inherent experimental
difﬁculties to measure the very long lifetimes of the 2Do
3/2,5/2 levels (∼1 h), the more feasible task of
measuring the lifetimes of the 2Po
1/2,3/2 levels (a few seconds) was developed. In the present work, we
showed that theory can do better than 50%: for both the N- and P-like ions of nebular interest, the
emissivity ratio uncertainties despite the A-value scatter are within 25%. Furthermore, by means of the
high-density benchmark with the observed line ratios (i.e., from the NGC 7027 planetary nebula), we can
discard A-value datasets to reduce the emissivity ratio uncertainty to the 10% level with some degree of
assurance. However, we notice that, in spite of accurate R1 ratios, the absolute A-values in some datasets
are somewhat larger, particularly those for [O II] A(2Do
3/2) recently computed with the MCDF
method [42–44]. This type of discrepancy can only be resolved by measurement, although we remain

skeptical in light of the long-standing discord between theory and experiment regarding the Fe XVII 3C/3D
f -value ratio [66].

Regarding the recent MBZ20 ECS for the carbon sequence [56], we demonstrated that this dataset
leads to large discrepancies in the emissivity ratios of both N II and O III and should therefore not be used
in the electron temperature range 5 ≤ Te ≤ 20 kK. As shown in Figure 12, the broad peak at ≈0.29 Ryd in
the O III Ω(1D2,3 P0) collision strength by SSB14 [63] (default) is downshifted in MBZ20 to ≈0.22 Ryd, in
disagreement with an experimental benchmark of 0.294 Ryd [62,64]. The origin of this discrepancy may be
found in the large O III atomic model (590 ﬁne-structure levels from 24 conﬁgurations including orbitals
with principal quantum number n ≤ 5) of MBZ20, which has been optimized speciﬁcally to provide ECS
at high temperatures. They adjusted the nl-dependent scaling parameters in a systematic way without
manual re-adjustment to avoid introducing arbitrary changes across the isoelectronic sequence. This
strategy leads to poor atomic structure for low-charge ions such as O III and, thus, less accurate collision
data at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the resonance effect is reduced, so their data should be
more accurate (Mao Junjie, private communication). As a result, we can conclude that the uncertainty level
in the [N II] 5755/6584 emissivity ratios using ECS from LB94, HB04, and T11 and in [O III] 4363/5007
from LB94, AK99, SSB14, and TZ17 is within 10%. This outcome is a good example that the latest and
largest atomic calculation is not necessarily the most accurate and should therefore be carefully examined,
as we showed here, before data are included in plasma models. This last point has also been stressed in the
context of the long-standing discrepancies in the ECS computed for Be-like ions by independent R-matrix
methods [67].

After providing and applying atomic data in nebular modeling for almost ﬁve decades, we are amazed
at not being able to guarantee an acceptable level of accuracy. However, the present work contributes to
clarifying that computations for low- and high-energy regimes cannot be treated simultaneously with the
same level of accuracy, a fact that must be taken into account in atomic database maintenance. We tend to
agree with [65] that we have a laboratory astrophysics problem in hand with no foreseeable solution due
to the endemic difﬁculties in computing, measuring, and evaluating the data products. As proposed in
[16], open and ﬂuid user–provider interactions and early data curation schemes in the research cycle are
perhaps the best we can do.

As future work within the present initiative, we intend to revise and complete the atomic data for the
lowly ionized species of the iron-group elements, for which there are non-conclusive accuracy evaluations.
We would ﬁnally like to mention that, in reference to data-curation strategies, a historical atomic database
as kept in PyNeb is a welcome step in data preservation, and the choice of a ﬂat ASCII format rather than
FITS to facilitate longevity and user interaction must be seriously considered in database design.
