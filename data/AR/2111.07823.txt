Abstract 

We report the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study on nonstoichiometric CrN1+ÔÅ§ 

thin films grown by reactive magnetron sputtering on c-plane sapphire and MgO (100) substrates in 

a Ar/N2 gas mixture using different percentages of N2. There is a transition from n-type to p-type 

behavior in the layers as a function of nitrogen concentration varying from 48 to 52 at. % in CrN films. 

The compositional change follows a similar trend for all substrates, with a N/Cr ratio increasing from 

approximately 0.7 to 1.06-1.11 by increasing percentage of N2 in the gas flow ratio. As a result of the 

change in stoichiometry, the lattice parameter and the Seebeck coefficient increase together with 

the increase of N in CrN1+ÔÅ§; in particular, the Seebeck value coefficient transitions from -50 ŒºV.K-1 for 

CrN0.97 to  +75  ŒºV.K-1 for  CrN1.1. Density  functional  theory  calculations  show  that  Cr  vacancies  can 

account for the change in Seebeck coefficient, since they push the Fermi level down in the valence 

band, whereas N interstitial defects in the form of N2 dumbbells are needed to explain the increasing 

lattice parameter. Calculations including both types of defects, which have a strong tendency to bind 

together, reveal a slight increase in the lattice parameter and a simultaneous formation of holes in 

the  valence  band.  To  explain  the  experimental  trends,  we  argue  that  both  Cr  vacancies  and  N2 

dumbbells,  possibly  in  combined  configurations,  are  present  in  the  films.  We  demonstrate  the 

possibility of controlling the semiconducting behavior of CrN with intrinsic defects from n- to p-type, 

opening possibilities to integrate this compound in energy-harvesting thermoelectric devices.

Introduction 

Thermoelectric (TE) materials are promising candidates for energy-harvesting devices [1-3] 

that  can  convert  heat  into  electricity  when  they  are  exposed  to  a  temperature  gradient.  A 

thermoelectric device is composed of several legs electrically connected in series of n-type and p-

type semiconductors [4,5]. The TE figure of merit (ùëßùëá), a dimensionless quantity related to the TE 

efficiency, is defined as ùëßùëá = ùëÜ2ÔÅ≥ùëá/(ùëòùëí + ùëòùëù), where ùëÜ, ÔÅ≥ , ùëá, ùëòùëí and ùëòùëù are the Seebeck coefficient, 

the electrical conductivity, the absolute temperature, the electronic thermal conductivity and lattice 

thermal conductivity (phonon), respectively. ùëßùëá can be optimized by maximizing the parameter ùëÜ2,  

called power factor, and minimizing the lattice thermal conductivity, which is the main contribution 

to  the  thermal  conductivity  in  semiconductors.  Among  established  thermoelectric  materials, 

telluride-based materials typically show the highest ùëßùëá values [3]. However, for future production 

and/or use in commercial aspect, search for alternative materials is urgently needed because of the 

scarcity, toxicity, and low global production of tellurium [6-10]. To accommodate this demand, the 

search for new thermoelectric materials is largely focused on silicides, oxides, nitrides, and organic 

materials  with  elements  which  are  more  abundant  and  less  toxic  [7,11].  Among  nitrides  for 

thermoelectric  applications,  scandium-  and  chromium-based  nitrides  have  been  reported  with 

promising thermoelectric properties [12-18].  

Sc-  and  Cr-based  nitride  materials  exhibit n-type  conduction with promising properties for 

further integration in TE devices. However, for device integration both n-type and p-type materials 

are needed. P-type ScN can be fabricated by alloying/doping with Mg or Mn on Sc sites [10,13,19]. 

The  power  factor  of  n-type  CrN  is  high,  and  this  material  has  an  intrinsically  lower  thermal 

conductivity than ScN [12,20,21].  The main mechanism that leads to lower thermal conductivity in 

CrN  is  related  to  its  magnetic  properties,  since  this  compound  undergoes  a  transition  from  an 

antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic (PM) state at a critical temperature Tc close to 280 K [22]: above 

Tc, scattering of phonons due to the magnetic disorder reduces even further the thermal conductivity 

as compared to other nonmagnetic rock-salt transition-metal nitrides [23].  

First-principles modelling of materials in the PM state is not trivial. Approximation of the PM 

phase of a magnetic material with a nonmagnetic state leads to wrong results in some cases [24-27]. 

However, the PM phase can be modelled by density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the 

disordered local moment (DLM) approximation, in which the PM state is represented by disordered 

magnetic  moments 

in  the 

lattice  [28-32].  Initially  employed  with  the  coherent  potential 

3 

 
approximation (CPA) [33], it has been then extended to supercell calculations [34], which allow to 

perform local lattice relaxations, a main requisite for the investigation of defects. In the past years, 

other methods to perform relaxations consistently in the PM state have been also developed [35,36]. 

Defects  are  important  in  transition-metal  nitrides  with  the  cubic  rock-salt  structure, 

susceptible to non-stoichiometry [15,37-40]. In the case of CrN, the presence of vacancies and/or 

other types of defects coupled with the narrow band gap of the intrinsic material varies the charge 

carrier  density  and  thus  provides  a  wide  range  of  electrical  properties  from  semiconductor  to 

metallic-like conduction [41,42]. 

Several  studies  have  reported  that  n-type  CrN1-ÔÅ§  exhibit  relatively  high  zT  (0.1  -  0.35  in  a 

temperature range from RT to 400 ÔÇ∞C, with moderate electrical conductivity (1.7 ‚Äì 350 mÔÅó.cm), low 

thermal conductivity (2 - 4 W.m-1.K-1), and high absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient (135 - 200 

ÔÅ≠V.K-1)  [15,43-45].  The  n-type  behavior  of  understoichiometric  CrN1+ÔÅ§  has  been  explained  by  DFT 

calculations to be induced by N vacancies, which shift the Fermi level towards the conduction band 

[38]. N interstitials in the form of N2 dumbbells have been also shown to induce an n-type behavior 

in  this  compound,  although the  effect  is  weaker  than  observed with  N  vacancies.  McGahay  et  al. 

showed that growing CrN thin films in the presence of oxygen leads to the formation of an oxynitride 

Cr1-x/2N1-xOx compound with random distribution of O atoms on the N sublattice accompanied by the 

formation of Cr vacancies [46]. By increasing O concentration, they observed an insulator-to-metal 

transition, followed by an additional transition back to an insulating state. For x ‚â§ 0.26, the Cr1-x/2N1-

xOx layers are n-type semiconductors with increasing number of carriers of this type. On the other 

hand, p-type behavior was observed for overstoichiometric CrN doped with Al (Cr0.96Al0.04N1.17) film 

[47] and on films deposited by radio-frequency sputtering using relatively large portion of nitrogen 

as reactive gas, although no detailed film composition was reported in the latter case [48]. These 

different  studies  have  shown  the  sensitivity  of  the  electrical  behavior  of  CrN  with  dopants  or 

contaminants. To improve the thermoelectric properties of the potential p-type CrN, there is a need 

of fundamental understanding of the underlying origin of this p-type semiconductor behavior in CrN 

without  any  dopant.  This  may  guide  further  studies  on  the  control  the  electrical  properties  with 

dopants ultimately.  

Therefore, with a motivation to develop both n-type and p-type CrN-based thermoelectric 

materials, ultimately required for TE devices, we demonstrate here the possibility to convert n-type 

CrN to p-type CrN1+ÔÅ§ by controlling the stoichiometry, without the need for dopants. We show the 

4 

 
effect of Cr vacancies combined with nitrogen interstitials on the thermoelectric properties of this 

CrN1+ÔÅ§  compound.  The  different  characteristics  of  the  films  synthesized  by  reactive  magnetron 

sputtering  were  examined  (crystal  structure,  morphology,  elemental  composition),  and  the 

thermoelectric properties evaluated from ambient temperature up to 525 ÔÇ∞C. DFT calculations of PM 

CrN1+ÔÅ§ are carried out with defects compatible with the N overstoichiometry on the Cr sublattice, on 

the  N  sublattice,  and  on  both  sublattices  at  the  same  time.  These  calculations  indicate  that  Cr 

vacancies  can  induce  the  p-type  behavior  observed  experimentally,  although  presence  of  N2 

dumbbells is needed to explain the expansion of the lattice parameter. 

Experimental and method  

Material synthesis: 

330 nm CrN1+ÔÅ§ thick films were deposited simultaneously onto c-plane sapphire, MgO (100) 

and  LaAlO3(100)  (abbreviated  LAO)  substrates  using  a  magnetically  unbalanced  magnetron 

sputtering system (base pressure ÔÅæ 10-5 Pa) equipped with confocal target configuration [49]. The Cr 

(99.95 % purity) target was 7.5-cm (3 inch) diameter water-cooled disk electrically connected to a DC 

power  supply  at  a  constant  power  of  200  W.  The  films  were  deposited  using  different  N2/Ar  gas 

mixtures. The flow of nitrogen was kept constant at 20 sccm, while the flow of argon was changed 

from 6 to 30 sccm leading to different N2 % of the total gas-flow from 77 % to 40 % and different 

working  pressures  from  0.25  to  0.40  Pa,  respectively.  The  target  was  located  at  18  cm  from  the 

substrate,  which  was  mounted  on  a  rotating  sample  holder  coupled  with  a  heating  element.  The 

nominal temperature was fixed at Ts = 700 ¬∞C (corresponding approximately to 600¬∞C at the substrate 

surface), and a substrate bias voltage of -30 V (DC equivalent) was applied during deposition using 

an  RF  power  supply.  The  substrates  were  first  cleaned  using  detergent  steps,  then  10  min  using 

acetone  in  ultrasonic  bath  and  repeated  with  ethanol  and  finally  blown  dry  with  a  N2-gun.  The 

detergent steps are described elsewhere [50]. Prior deposition, an in-situ Ar etching was performed 

using a RF substrate bias of ‚Äì 90 V for 2 minutes. The total deposition time was 3500 s.  

Materials analysis:  

The crystal structure of the films was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The ÔÅ±-2Œ∏ scans 

were recorded in an X‚ÄôPert PRO from PANalytical in a Bragg Brentano using a Cu KŒ± radiation with a 

5 

 
 
 
nickel  filter.  Philips  X'Pert-MRD  with  Cu  KŒ±  radiation  was used  determining  with accuracy  the  cell 

parameter on MgO substrate using a hybrid mirror on the incidence beam path and a triple axis Ge 

220 analyser on the diffracted beam path. The surface morphology of the films was examined using 

a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO Gemini 1550, Zeiss) operated at 5 KeV. 

The elemental compositions of nitride films were determined by time-of-flight elastic recoil 

detection analysis (ToF-ERDA) in a tandem accelerator. ToF-ERDA was carried out with a 36 MeV 127I8+ 

probe beam incident at 67.5¬∞ with respect to the sample surface normal, and recoils are detected at 

45¬∞. More details about the measurements are given in reference [51]. The elemental compositions 

were  also  determined  using  a  wavelength  dispersive  spectrometer  (WDS)  unit  from  Oxford 

Instruments (High Wycombe, UK) attached to a JEOL 7001 TTLS scanning electron microscope (Tokyo, 

Japan) operated at 10 kV. 

Several  measurement  setups  were  used  to  investigate  the  electrical  and  thermoelectric 

properties. The Seebeck coefficient was measured using two different setups. The first one at room 

temperature (RT) using a home-built thermoelectric measurement setup equipped with two Peltier 

heat  sources  for  creating  a  temperature  gradient  in  the  sample,  two  K-type  thermocouples  for 

measuring the temperature. The two electrodes are made of Cu and are in contact with the sample 

in an area of 9 mm x 1 mm in which the K-type thermocouples are present and electrically isolated. 

The  different  voltages  obtained for  different   ÔÅÑT  (0  to 10  K) were  measured  with  a  Keithley  2001 

multimeter and two thermometers. Room temperature resistivity measurements were performed in 

a  Van  der  Pauw  configuration  using  a  Ecopia  AMP-55  Hall  measurement  system.  The  in-plane 

Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity were measured simultaneously under a low-pressure 

helium atmosphere (‚àº 0.09 MPa, purity 99.999 (H2O < 3ppm and O2 < 2ppm) using ULVAC-RIKO ZEM3 

from RT up to 400 ¬∞C. The substrate contribution to the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity 

is negligible, and the instrumental error is within 10 %. 

Theoretical calculation: 

Density  functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations  were  performed  with  the  Vienna  Ab  initio 

Simulation  Package  (VASP)  [52,53]  with  projector  augmented-wave  (PAW)  [54,55]  potentials  and 

employing LDA exchange-correlation functional. Strong electron correlation was included with the 

LDA+U scheme as devised by Dudarev [56], employing a value Ueff = 3 eV on the Cr 3d electrons which 

is  known  to  describe  well  both  the  low  and  high  temperature  phases,  together  with  reasonable 

6 

 
 
electronic properties [34]. The energy cut-off for expansion of plane-waves was set to 400 eV, while 

sampling the first Brillouin zone with a 3ÔÇ¥3ÔÇ¥3 Monkhorst-Pack k-mesh. The criterion for convergence 

of electronic optimization was set to 10-3 eV/supercell. Spin-polarized calculations are carried out 

with collinear moments. To model the PM phase, we used the magnetic sampling method (MSM) 

[34], a supercell implementation of the DLM approach, which consists of employing many different 

magnetic  configurations  of  randomly  distributed  up  and  down  moments.  The  defective  CrN1+Œ¥ 

structures were relaxed in the DLM state with the DLM-relaxation method described in Ref. [35] using 

the defect free equilibrium volume.  

The equilibrium lattice parameter of the structures with a single defect (a Cr vacancy or a N2 

dumbbell)  was  obtained  from  the  equation  of  state,  calculated  with  a  supercell  made  of  2ÔÇ¥2ÔÇ¥2 

repetitions of the conventional rock-salt cell (32 formula units) and employing five different volumes, 

using the atomic positions relaxed at the defect-free equilibrium volume. At each volume, we carried 

out  MSM  calculations  with  ten  different  magnetic  configurations.  The  equation  of  state  was 

calculated for each magnetic configuration separately and the equilibrium lattice parameter for the 

defective structures was then retrieved as an average of the equilibrium lattice parameters of each 

magnetic  configuration.  For  the  combined  defects  (Cr  vacancy  and  N2  dumbbell  in  the  same 

supercell), we performed the same procedure but with a 3ÔÇ¥3ÔÇ¥3 supercell. 

The calculation of formation and interaction energy of defects was carried out with a 3ÔÇ¥3ÔÇ¥3 

supercell  (ùëõ = 108  formula  units)  to  minimize  self-interaction  of  the  defects.  The  energy  of  the 

defective  supercells  was  obtained  by  MSM  static  calculations  with  25  different  magnetic 

configurations on the geometry resulting from DLM-relaxation of these 3x3x3 supercells. The total 

energy  of  the  supercell  was  obtained  as  an  average  over  all  the  magnetic  configurations.  The 

formation energy of the single or combined defect is defined as: 

ùê∏ùëì(Crùëõ‚àíùë£Nùëõ+ùëë) = ùê∏(Crùëõ‚àíùë£Nùëõ+ùëë) ‚àí [

(1) 

where ùê∏(Crùëõ‚àíùë£Nùëõ+ùëë) is the energy of the defective supercell, ùê∏(CrùëõNùëõ) is the energy of the defect-

free CrN 3ÔÇ¥3ÔÇ¥3  supercell, ùëõ is the number of formula units in the defect-free supercell, ùê∏(N2) is the 

energy of a N2 molecule, ùë£ = {0,1} is an index that indicates the presence (ùë£ = 1) or absence (ùë£ = 0) 

of a vacancy in the Cr sublattice, and ùëë = {0,1} is a corresponding index for the N interstitial atom in 

the form of a N2 dumbbell (notice the different sign for the ùë£ and ùëë indices in the formula). We choose 

7 

 
 
to employ the chemical potential of N for both types of defects because this is likely the relevant 

chemical potential in experiments [57]. The interaction energy between two defects is defined as: 

ùê∏ùëñ(Crùëõ‚àíùë£Nùëõ+ùëë) = ùê∏ùëì(Crùëõ‚àíùë£Nùëõ+ùëë) ‚àí ùê∏ùëì(Crùëõ‚àíùë£Nùëõ) ‚àí ùê∏ùëì(CrùëõNùëõ+ùëë), 

(2) 

with negative (positive) energy indicating attractive (repulsive) interaction. 

In addition, we calculated the density of state (DOS) of relevant supercells with defects in the PM 

phase as an average over all MSM magnetic configurations employed. 

Results and discussion 

Figure  1:    Film  non-stoichiometry  (from  ToF-ERDA)  represented  as  CrN1+Œ¥  for  the  series  of  film  deposited  on  c-plane 
sapphire (a) and MgO (100) (b) with different N2 % of the total gas flow. The grey zone represents the error bar extracted 
from the ToF-ERDA analysis. Note here that the oxygen contamination is not taken into account in the calculation. 

Figure 1 is a visual representation of the evolution of the film non-stoichiometry, denoted as 

CrN1+Œ¥, measured by ToF-ERDA on c-plane sapphire and MgO (100) when the N2 % of the total gas 

flow is varied. For all samples, the oxygen contamination in the films was estimated to be equal or 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
less  than  0.9  %  with  a  lower  oxygen  content  on  c-plane  sapphire  with  an  average  of  0.4  %  as 

compared  to  0.7  %  on  MgO  (table  S1  in  the  supplementary  information).  Differences  in  O 

contamination  between  the  two  series  most  probably  originates  from  the  different  substrate, 

suggesting that diffusion from the substrate to the film may be more pronounced on MgO substrate. 

On all substrates and at low N2 %, the films have the N/Cr ratio ÔÅÄ 0.7, which increases to values higher 

than 1.0 (between 1.01 and 1.11 depending on the substrate) when the N2 % increases. Although the 

films  were  deposited  on  the  different  substrates  in  the  same  batch,  differences  in  elemental 

composition are observed between substrates. For example, the films on MgO (100) have a higher 

N/Cr  ratio  in  the  N-rich  side  of  the  series  and  a  larger  decrease  in  the  N/Cr  ratio  is  found  when 

decreasing N2 % of the total gas flow in comparison with the films deposited on c-plane sapphire. 

Within the error bar of the ToF-ERDA data analysis, the films deposited on c-plane sapphire at a N2 % 

between 57 and 77 % can be considered stochiometric (CrN1). Nevertheless, small differences are 

present with the nominal value varying from CrN0.97 to CrN1.01 when the films are deposited at 57 or 

77 N2 %. The films deposited using 51 N2 % or less are understoichiometric with a minimum value of 

Œ¥  in  CrN1+Œ¥  at  -0.32  (or  CrN0.68).  On  MgO  (100),  the  films  deposited  between  62  and  68  N2 %  are 

stochiometric  (CrN1).  The  films  deposited  using  57  N2  %  or  less  are  understoichiometric  with  a 

minimum value of Œ¥ in CrN1+Œ¥ at -0.29 (or CrN0.71). Note here that the measurements were performed 

using  two  different  techniques  which  their  results  show  good  agreement.  The  details  of  the 

elemental composition analysis can be found in the supplementary information (table S1 and table 

S2).  The  oxygen  content  detected  (1  %  or  less)  was  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  the  ratio 

anion/cation in the NaCl structure of CrN (Fig. 1). If the oxygen was included in the calculation, all 

ratios anion/Cr would increase by an average of + 0.02 in the N-rich side of the series: for example, 

at the highest N2 % and on MgO (100), the (N+O)/Cr becomes 1.13 instead of 1.11 without taking into 

account the oxygen. 

The morphology of the films in the N-rich CrN1+Œ¥ is similar within a given substrate series, with 

rounded triangular grains which tend to merge, forming elongated features on c-plane sapphire while 

a well-arranged pavement of square shaped grains is observed on MgO (100) when the N2 % is higher 

than  -0.03  ÔÇ£  ÔÅ§  ÔÇ£+  0.11.  The  changes  within  the  series  on  c-plane  sapphire  are  relatively  small 

compared  to  the  series  on  MgO  (100)  and  explained  by  the  relatively  small  changes  in  the 

composition in the films. An overstoichiometric film (ÔÅ§ ÔÇ≥ -0.01) seems to consist of smaller grains 

9 

 
than an understoichiometric film (ÔÅ§ ÔÇ£- 0.03). More details on the morphology are presented in the 

supplementary information (Fig. S3).

that a) and b) are plotted using  a log scale while c) and d) are with a linear scale. a), b) and c) are  measurement performed 
in a Bragg Brentano configuration using a Cu KŒ± radiation with a nickel filter. d) is a HRXRD measurement performed using 
a Cu KŒ±1 radiation with an ÔÅ∑offset = 0.1 ‚Äì 0.2 ÔÇ∞. Peaks marked with ÔÄ™ correspond to the substrate peaks: 0006 (Al2O3), 002 
(MgO). 

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the CrN1+Œ¥ films with different stoichiometries on different 

substrates (c-plane sapphire, MgO (100)) represented in log scale (a and b) and a magnified range in 

linear  scale  (c  and  d).  The  full  XRD  patterns  (2ÔÅ±:  10-90ÔÇ∞)  are  presented  in  the  supplementary 

information (Fig. S1). For the clarity of the figure 2d the substrate peak has been dimmed to visualize 

better  the  film  peaks.  The  XRD  pattern  are  also  represented  in  supplementary  information 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
individually. Regardless of the substrate, the diffractogram of the CrN1+Œ¥ films with -0.03 ÔÇ£ ÔÅ§ ÔÇ£ +0.11  

exhibits one diffraction peak belonging to the film depending on the N2 % in the gas flow. This peak 

is identified as the one from the rock-salt CrN phase. Note here that the diffraction peak belonging 

to the film differs between 111 and 002, revealing a highly oriented film along the [111] or [001] 

directions of CrN on c-plane sapphire or on MgO (100), respectively. The orientation observed on c-

plane sapphire is typical of an epitaxial growth which consists of twin domains in the cubic material 

thin film on c-plane sapphire [58]. On MgO (100) substrate, CrN grows following the so-called cube-

on-cube epitaxial growth [59,60]. The term ‚Äúepitaxial‚Äù is here used to describe the polycrystalline 

film composed of grains epitaxially oriented to the substrate crystal structure. Note here that the 

orientation of the films is consistent with the morphology of the N-rich CrN1+Œ¥ films with triangular 

shape  grains  for  a  (111)  oriented  films  and  square  shape  grains  for  (001)  oriented  films.  The 

orientation of the films, hence the surface energy, may influence the adsorption/reaction of nitrogen 

molecules  on  top  the  surface  of  the  film  during  deposition.  This  influence  seems  to  be  more 

pronounced for (001) oriented films than for (111) oriented ones, as Figure 1 shows.  

With CrN1+Œ¥ films having ÔÅ§  ÔÇ£ -0.07, two other diffraction peaks are visible on c-plane sapphire 

¬Ø
at 2ÔÅ± = 37.4ÔÇ∞ and 40.6ÔÇ∞ identified as the 112

0 and 0002 peak from Cr2N phase, see Fig. 2(a). These 

peaks are clearly visible on the XRD pattern when ÔÅ§  = -0.31, but can be also distinguished from an 

increase in the background intensity and a different shapes of the peak on the XRD pattern for the 

CrN1+Œ¥ films with ÔÅ§  ÔÇ£ -0.07. For the series deposited on MgO, this secondary phase identified as Cr2N 

is  not  clearly  visible  on  a  Bragg  Brentano  configuration  measurement  measured  due  to  the  high 

intensity of the substrate peak and the proximity to the film peak, Fig. 2(b). A ÔÅ±-2ÔÅ± measurement 

using a monochromatic Cu KÔÅ°1 and an œâ offset of 0.1-0.2 ÔÇ∞ allows to diminish the intensity of the 002 

peak from MgO and reveal the film peak (Fig. S2 in supplementary information). Similarly to the films 

deposited on c-plane sapphire, the phase composition in the films varies from pure CrN1+Œ¥ at high N2 

% to a mixture of CrN1+Œ¥ and Cr2N when ÔÅ§ ÔÇ£ -0.08. At the lowest amount of N2 % in the gas flow ratio, 

the film is mainly composed of Cr2N phase. On all substrates and upon increasing of N content in 

CrN1+Œ¥, the CrN1+Œ¥ peak position is shifted towards lower 2ÔÅ± values. Therefore, increasing nitrogen in 

CrN1+Œ¥ leads to an increase of the cell parameter.

the XRD peak corresponding to the main peak of CrN (001 or 111) depending on the substrate (see Fig. 2). The vertical 
line corresponds to the transition from negative to positive Seebeck coefficient (see Fig. 4). The vertical arrows represent 
the change of cell parameter on the same substrate compared to a film CrN1+Œ¥ at which the transition from negative to 
positive Seebeck coefficient occurs. 

Figure 3 displays the evolution of the cell parameter of the cubic CrN1+Œ¥ phase for the different 

films as a function of ÔÅ§. Regardless of the substrate used, the CrN1+Œ¥ phase has an increase of its cell 

parameter  when  the  nitrogen  content  in  the  film  increases.  In  this  study,  two  references  can  be 

appropriate: i) The cell parameter of a stoichiometric film (CrN1.00) around 4.20 (ÔÇ± 0.005) √Ö which is 

comparable to the values reported in literature between 4.15 to 4.18 √Ö for CrN [43,45,60]; ii) the cell 

parameter of CrN0.975 film at which the Seebeck coefficient switches from positive to negative values. 

The variation of the cell parameter is dependent of the nitrogen content in the film. A variation of ÔÅ§ 

= + 0.035 in CrN1+Œ¥ (CrN0.975 to CrN1.01) lead to an increase of the cell parameter of +0.03 √Ö (+ 0.5%). 

An increase of 1.2 % of the cell parameter is observed for an increase of ÔÅ§ to + 0.11 in CrN1+Œ¥.

Figure 4: a) Seebeck coefficient RT and b) electrical resistivity values of the films deposited under different N2 % of the 
total gas flow on different substrates (c-plane Al2O3, MgO (100)). The electrical properties are represented versus the 
nitrogen  composition  in  CrN1+Œ¥.  The  vertical  line  corresponds  to  the  transition  from  negative  to  positive  Seebeck 
coefficient.  

Figure  4  displays  the  RT  values  of  the  Seebeck  coefficient  and  the  resistivity  versus  the 

nitrogen composition as ÔÅ§ in CrN1+ÔÅ§. Regardless of the substrate, a trend is noticeable for the electrical 

properties of the film depending on the nitrogen content. The measured Seebeck coefficient at RT is 

positive (+ 50 to +80 ŒºV.K-1) when the films are overstoichiometric and becomes negative (- 25 to -

50 ŒºV.K-1) when the films are understoichiometric. The transition from positive to negative Seebeck 

coefficient  occurs  at  Œ¥  ÔÇª  -0.025  and  not  Œ¥  =  0,  which  can  be  due  to  the  presence  of  oxygen 

contamination (< 1%) and/or experimental uncertainties [46]. The electrical resistivity of the films 

stays relatively high, between 10 to 80 mÔÅó.cm, for the overstoichiometric films and reduces by one 

or two orders of magnitude for the understoichiometric ones. The films with Œ¥ = -0.30 have a low 

Seebeck coefficient (12 ŒºV.K-1) and low electrical resistivity (200 ŒºÔÅó.cm), consistent with the physical 

characteristics of Cr2N [61].  

Figure  5  represents  the  thermoelectric  properties  measurements  (Seebeck  coefficient  and 

electrical resistivity) from RT to 400ÔÇ∞C for the films deposited on c-plane sapphire and on MgO (100). 

13 

 
 
The trend of the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity within a substrate series is similar 

as the one observed on Figure 4 where the measurement was performed on a different setup and 

only at RT. With the exception of the film with Œ¥ = -0.30, the electrical resistivity of the films decreases 

when the temperature increases revealing semiconductor behavior. The CrN1+Œ¥ films with Œ¥ = -0.30 

(corresponding  to  CrN0.7)  have  their  electrical  resistivities  increasing  when  the  temperature 

increases; hence, a metallic behavior with a relatively low resistivity (0.2 mÔÅó.cm) consistent with the 

properties of Cr2N [61]. On both substrates, the Seebeck coefficient values tend to increase up to a 

maximum attained around 200-250 ÔÇ∞C and then decreases slowly. Note that the film with Œ¥ of +0.11 

on  MgO  (100)  exhibits  higher  Seebeck  coefficient  values,  and  a  maximum  is  observed  at  higher 

temperature (350 ÔÇ∞C) compared to the other films.

different compositions: a) and c) on c-plane Al2O3, b) and d) on MgO (100) 

The  Seebeck  coefficient  of  semiconductors  can  be  described  by  the  Mott-Boltzmann 

formalism  from  a  relatively  simple  model  with  energy-independent  scattering  approximation  and 

14 

 
 
 
parabolic band [4]. The Seebeck coefficients (Sn) for the majority and minority charge carriers are 

defined as followed: 

Sn =

2 T
8œÄ2kB
3eh2 m‚àó (

2 3‚ÅÑ
œÄ
)
3n

(3) 

where n corresponds to the carrier concentration of electron (or p for holes), m‚àó is the effective mass, 

T the temperature and h is Planck‚Äôs constant [4,5]. For intrinsic semiconductors, both conduction and 

valence bands may play a role in the transport. Thus, the total Seebeck (ST) coefficient is given by [5]:  

ST =

SnœÉn + SpœÉp
œÉn + œÉp

(4) 

The  charge  carriers  (electrons  (n)  and  holes  (p))  would  then  compete  and  cancel  out  the 

induced Seebeck voltage. This is in analogy with metals, which have low Seebeck coefficients, and an 

extreme case is Ti3SiC2 with S = 0 over a wide temperature range [62-64]. In the present case, both 

p-type and n-type behavior were observed depending on the composition with a transition at room 

temperature happening at Œ¥ = -0.03 in CrN1+Œ¥. The temperature evolution of the Seebeck coefficient 

values  for  samples having  low  absolute  Seebeck  values  (Œ¥  ‚âà  -0.03)  can come  from  more  complex 

phenomena with variation of both types of charge carriers (electrons and holes) with respect to both 

concentrations and mobilities when the temperature increases.  

A theoretical approach was used to understand the underlying cause of this transition in the 

Seebeck  values  from  negative  to  positive  or  from  n-type  to  p-type  semiconductor  behavior  as  a 

function of the nitrogen content. DFT calculations were used to compute the formation energy of 

some possible defects responsible for nitrogen overstoichiometry in cubic CrN1+Œ¥ phase. The defects 

considered are the Cr vacancy, the N interstitial, and the N antisite. The N interstitial defect in CrN 

has been previously [38] shown to be most stable in a dumbbell configuration, i.e., a N2 dimer placed 

with its center on a lattice site and aligned along a <111> direction. The formation energies of these 

defects are reported in Table 1. Cr vacancy is found to have the lowest formation energy of 2.48 eV. 

Formation  energies  in  general  define  the  relative  stability  of  different  defects  in  equilibrium 

conditions;  however,  the  deposition  technique  employed  in  this  study  is  far  from  equilibrium; 

therefore, thermodynamic reasoning alone cannot establish the prevalence of one defect over the 

other in the as-deposited films. For this reason, we cannot rule out the presence of both Cr vacancies 

and N dumbbells. Calculations with a combination of Cr vacancy and N2 dumbbells were also taken 

into account, and we observe that the formation energy of these complexes is generally lower than 

the N antisite (see Table 1), which we therefore neglect in the rest of the discussion. We consider 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
four configurations of Cr vacancy + N2 dumbbell defects, which are shown in Fig. 6: in the first two 

cases  [a)  and b)  in  Fig.  6],  the dumbbell  is  positioned  on  a  lattice  site  nearest neighbor to the Cr 

vacancy,  and  aligned  either  along  [110]  in  Fig.  6a)  or  [100]  in  Fig.  6b).  In  the  third  and  fourth 

configurations (Fig 6c and 6d), the N2 dumbbell is in third nearest neighbor position to the Cr vacancy 

with different orientations, where in the former case the dumbbell is oriented toward the vacancy. 

As  Table  1  shows,  the  formation  energy  depends  on  the  defect  configuration,  with  energy  of 

formation varying from 4.75 to 6.07 eV. The combined defect with highest formation energy displays 

a weak interaction energy as compared to the other defects, as can also be realized from Fig. 6d), 

since  in  this  case  the  dumbbell  is  not  directed  towards  the  Cr  vacancy.  Finally,  we  see  that  the 

interaction energies of the defects are all negative, indicating attraction between the Cr vacancy and 

N2 dumbbell; therefore, during the deposition process, we can argue that if these defects are formed 

near each other, they will attract and form a more stable configuration.

atoms are in blue, N atoms in grey and the N atoms in the dumbbell in red. Notice the missing Cr atom in position (0,0,0)

Table 2 reports the computed equilibrium lattice parameters for defective (Cr vacancy and 

the N2 dumbbell and the most stable configuration of the combined defect) and defect-free CrN cubic 

structures. Comparatively to the defect-free structure, it is found that the N2 dumbbell leads to an 

expansion of 0.7% of the lattice parameter, whereas the Cr vacancy induces a reduction by 0.3%; 

however, the combined defect seems to lead to a small increase of the lattice parameter as well, 

consistent with the experimental results with a variation of + 0.5 to + 1.2 %. 

From previous studies [38], it is known that N vacancies in CrN can induce n-type behavior in 

the  DOS.  The  same  behavior  is  argued  for  in  the  case  of  the  N2  dumbbell,  although  with  a  much 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
weaker  strength.  Figure  7  displays  the  DOS  for  the  single  defects  and  for  the  most  stable 

configuration with the two defects combined [figure 6a)]. We see that in the present cases with the 

Cr vacancy, the valence band is shifted to higher energy, leading to a p-type behavior, as observed in 

the present experiments. The N2 dumbbell alone affects the DOS very weakly, shifting the valence 

band to lower energies as compared to the defect free system, whereas the Cr vacancy shows a more 

pronounced effect on the shift of the same band. The combination of the two defects is somewhat 

in between, but with character more similar to the Cr vacancy. These results indicate that the N2 

dumbbells  alone,  which  can  account  for  expansion  of  the  lattice  parameter  as  a  function  of  N2 

content in the plasma, cannot be responsible for the p-type behavior seen in the experiments, but a 

combination  of  N2  dumbbells  and  Cr  vacancies  could  instead  account  for  the  positive  Seebeck 

coefficient  together  with  an  expanded  lattice  parameter.  It  is  also  possible  that  upon  higher 

concentration of defects more complex defects could lead to even larger effects on the electronic 

structure.  Nonetheless,  the  results  for  highest  non-stoichiometry  are  still  compatible  with  the 

investigated defects and a detailed explanation of the deviation from linear behavior in the Seebeck 

coefficient and lattice parameter as a function of Œ¥ is beyond the scope of this work. 

Figure 7: Electronic DOS around the Fermi level calculated with DFT on defect-free CrN, CrN with a Cr vacancy (Cr1-xN), 
CrN with a N2 dumbbell (CrN1+y), and with the most stable configuration of the combined defects (Cr1-xN1+y), shown in Fig. 
6a). The zero of the energy is the Fermi level. 

Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  we  show  the  possibility  of  synthesizing  nonstoichiometric  CrN1+ÔÅ§  thin  films  ranging 

from n- to p-type behavior by increasing the N content. We explain this behavior with first principles 

calculations  of  intrinsic  defects,  which  show  that  Cr  vacancies  induce  the  p-type  behavior  and  N2 

dumbbells increase the lattice parameter, as observed in experiments. These two defects also show 

18 

 
 
a strong interaction energy, suggesting that they attract each other and form complexes of defects 

in the system. Temperature-dependent measurements show also that the overstoichiometric CrN1.11 

films retain their large positive value of the Seebeck coefficient up to 400ÔÇ∞C. This study is important 

for the development of thermoelectric devices based on CrN without the need of doping with foreign 

elements.
