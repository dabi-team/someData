Abstract Solar active regions (ARs) that produce major ﬂares typically exhibit
strong plasma shear ﬂows around photospheric magnetic polarity inversion lines
(MPILs). It is therefore important to quantitatively measure such photospheric
shear ﬂows in ARs for a better understanding of their relation to ﬂare occurrence.
Photospheric ﬂow ﬁelds were determined by applying the Diﬀerential Aﬃne
Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) method to a large
data set of 2,548 co-aligned pairs of AR vector magnetograms with 12-min
separation over the period 2012–2016. From each AR ﬂow-ﬁeld map, three shear-
ﬂow parameters were derived corresponding to the mean (< S >), maximum
(Smax) and integral (Ssum) shear-ﬂow speeds along strong-gradient, strong-ﬁeld
MPIL segments. We calculated ﬂaring rates within 24 hr as a function of each
shear-ﬂow parameter, and also investigated the relation between the parameters
and the waiting time (τ ) until the next major ﬂare (class M1.0 or above) after
the parameter observation. In general, it is found that the larger Ssum an AR
has, the more likely it is for the AR to produce ﬂares within 24 hr. It is also
found that among ARs which produce major ﬂares, if one has a larger value of
Ssum then τ generally gets shorter. These results suggest that large ARs with
widespread and/or strong shear ﬂows along MPILs tend to not only be more
ﬂare productive, but also produce major ﬂares within 24 hr or less.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares produce strong electromagnetic radiation, often associated with high-
energy particles and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can disturb the state
of the near-Earth space environment, known as space weather. In general, ﬂares
occur suddenly with a signiﬁcant increase in brightness by a few orders of mag-
nitude within minutes to tens of minutes. Stochasticity and abruptness in ﬂare
triggering render an accurate ﬂare prediction a very diﬃcult task. Over the last
few decades, there have been numerous studies on active region (AR) magnetic
ﬁeld and plasma properties to better understand the physics underlying ﬂare
energy build-up and triggering mechanisms as well as favorable preconditions
for ﬂares (e.g. Schrijver, 2009; Schmieder, Aulanier, and Vrˇsnak, 2015; Wang
et al., 2017, and references therein). Consequently, it is well known that most
ﬂares occur in solar ARs, where intense magnetic ﬁelds exist in the form of
complex, non-potential structures (e.g. Gallagher, Moon, and Wang, 2002; Jing
et al., 2010; Park, Chae, and Wang, 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Tziotziou, Georgoulis,
and Raouaﬁ, 2012; McCloskey, Gallagher, and Bloomﬁeld, 2016).

A large number of studies on AR magnetic polarity inversion lines (MPILs)
has been carried out to examine the relation between MPIL properties at single
points in time and ﬂare productivity. For example, Schrijver (2007) analyzed
a data set of 2,500 randomly selected AR line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms,
calculating a parameter (log(R)) that measures the total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux around a subset of MPILs that have strong gradients in the LOS magnetic
ﬁeld (Blos) across them. It was found that the larger the value of log(R), the
higher the probability for major ﬂares (M and X in the classiﬁcation of the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)) to occur in the AR
within 24 hr of the measurement. Falconer et al. (2011) considered a parameter
denoted (LWLSG) as a proxy for AR free magnetic energy, deﬁned as the integral
of the strength of the horizontal gradient of Blos over all strong-ﬁeld segments
of MPILs for which the horizontal component of the potential magnetic ﬁeld is
greater than 150 G. A positive correlation was found between LWLSG and the
event rate of major ﬂares over 24 hr after the observation time, by considering
1,300 ARs.

40,000 LOS magnetograms of
Numerical simulations report that ﬂaring ARs forming strong MPILs also
exhibit strong plasma shear ﬂows along them, associated mainly with emergence
and/or cancellation of magnetic ﬂux in the photosphere (e.g. Antiochos, DeVore,
and Klimchuk, 1999; Amari et al., 2003; Roussev et al., 2004; Manchester, 2008).
Several observational studies also support these simulation results. Yang et al.
(2004) found strong shear-ﬂow motions along MPILs of AR NOAA 10486 prior
to an X10 ﬂare. These shear ﬂows of persistent velocities of up to 1.6 km s−1
5 Mm around
appeared more than 2 hr before the ﬂare at spatial scales of
white-light ﬂare kernels. Deng et al. (2006) also observed in NOAA 10486 that
there were persistent and long-lived (i.e.
5 hr) strong horizontal and vertical

shear ﬂows (both on the order of 1 km s−1) at MPILs until the X10 ﬂare occurred.
Welsch et al. (2009) determined photospheric ﬂow ﬁelds in 46 ARs by applying
the Fourier Local Correlation Tracking (FLCT: Fisher and Welsch, 2008) and
Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator (DAVE: Schuck, 2005) methods to 2,708
co-aligned pairs of LOS magnetograms at 96-min time separation. Several pa-
rameters were calculated from the AR ﬂow-ﬁeld maps, such as the integral and
several statistical moments of MPIL-weighted and ﬁeld-weighted shear ﬂows (for
details on the parameters, see Table 2 of Welsch et al., 2009). Associating GOES
ﬂares with the magnetogram data, it was found that the shear-ﬂow parameters
are positively correlated with ﬂare peak ﬂux, but not as strongly as the magnetic
parameter log(R) is.

Although the investigation of AR shear-ﬂow properties is very important to
understand the triggering of ﬂares, it has rarely been carried out with a large data
set of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. In this article, we examine photospheric shear
ﬂows derived from 2,548 co-aligned pairs of AR vector magnetograms at 12-min
time separation over the period 2012–2016. Several parameters are determined to
characterize shear ﬂows near a subset of MPILs that exhibit strong horizontal
ﬁeld and strong gradients in the vertical component of magnetic ﬁeld. These
parameters are used to: i) study frequency distributions of ARs that do and do
not produce ﬂares in the next 24 hr, ii) calculate probabilities of ﬂaring in the
subsequent 24 hr as a function of each parameter, and iii) examine their relation
to the waiting time to the next major ﬂare after their measurement. This study
will help to not only better understand the role of AR photospheric shear ﬂows
in relation to ﬂare occurrence, but also potentially improve our ability to predict
ﬂares.

2. Data and Analysis

The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012) instrument
on board the the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and
Chamberlin, 2012) provides a 12-min cadence data product called Space-weather
HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs: Bobra et al., 2014) that can be useful for
autonomous monitoring of AR properties, as well as for ﬂare forecasting. There
are four SHARP data series, each of which includes 16 vector magnetic ﬁeld
parameters computed from automatically-identiﬁed HMI AR Patches (HARPs),
as well as co-aligned maps of the vector and LOS magnetic ﬁeld, Doppler velocity,
continuum intensity and other quantities for the HARP. In this study, we use the
hmi.sharp cea 720s nrt data series, consisting of near-realtime (NRT) SHARPs
remapped from CCD coordinates to heliographic Cylindrical Equal-Area (CEA)
coordinates with the three vector magnetic ﬁeld components, i.e. radial (Br),
zenithal (Bθ) and azimuthal (Bφ) components, recorded at a spatial sampling
of 0.03 degree pixel−1. Note that SHARP CEA NRT vector magnetograms are
processed through the HMI NRT pipeline with a preliminary calibration and
faster azimuth disambiguation (refer to Hoeksema et al., 2014, for the details
of calibration procedures and the diﬀerences between the NRT and deﬁnitive
data).

Park et al.

We calculate AR photospheric ﬂow ﬁelds using co-aligned pairs of SHARP
CEA NRT vector magnetograms with time separations of 12 min. A detailed
procedure for the determination of the AR ﬂow ﬁelds is as follows:

1. A large data set of SHARP CEA NRT vector magnetograms are downloaded
from the Multi-Experiment Data and Operations Centre (MEDOC; http://
medoc.ias.u-psud.fr) at times (Tobs) closest to 06:00 UT each day from 16
September 2012 to 13 April 2016, restricted to those SHARPs containing
NOAA-numbered ARs, being within 50◦ longitude from the central merid-
ian, and obtained before HMI new “Mod-L” observing scheme that uses the
polarization measurements from both front and side cameras (Liu et al., 2016).
2. For each vector magnetogram in the data set, a vector magnetogram with the
same HARP number but observed 12 min earlier than Tobs is downloaded, if
available.

3. Both images in each vector magnetogram pair are examined for oﬀ-limb pixels,
with both of the corresponding images trimmed to remove them, if necessary.
4. Co-registration of image pairs is achieved via cross correlation of the Br
images, with the resulting cross-correlation pixel oﬀsets applied to all three
magnetic ﬁeld components, Br, Bθ, and Bφ.

5. A plasma velocity inversion technique, called the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity
Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM: Schuck, 2008) is applied
to all co-aligned vector magnetogram pairs to calculate their photospheric
ﬂow-ﬁeld maps.

Note that the apodization window size (L) used in DAVE4VM is set to 15 pixels,
based on a test evaluating the normal component of the magnetic induction
equation over every pixel of ﬂow-ﬁeld maps calculated from randomly selected
SHARP image pairs with time separation of 12 min over diﬀerent values of L.
This is precisely the same test as in Schuck (2008) and Liu and Schuck (2012), but
for HMI NRT SHARPs at 12-min time separation in our case. It is important to
be aware that the HMI vector magnetograms have systematic errors (Hoeksema
et al., 2014; Couvidat et al., 2016), including the 12-hour periodicity and the
center-to-limb variation of noise levels, respectively, due to the spacecraft orbital
velocity relative to the Sun and irregular characteristics of the HMI instrument.
In this study, in order to mitigate those systematic errors to some degree, we
restrict the selected SHARP CEA NRT vector magnetograms to those observed
06:00 UT each day and with center positions within 50◦ from the central
at
≈
meridian.

For each SHARP image pair, we ﬁnd all the GOES soft X-rays ﬂares that
occurred in the corresponding SHARP ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) during its entire
passage across the solar disk. This is done searching for GOES ﬂares with either:
i) source regions the same as the NOAA AR number(s) assigned to the SHARP
image pair, ii) locations falling within the FOV of the SHARP image pair. Note
that we refer to the NOAA Edited Solar Event Lists (ftp://ftp.swpc.noaa.gov/
pub/warehouse) for information on GOES ﬂare start times, source regions, and
locations.

A total of 2,548 co-aligned pairs of 12-min-separated SHARP CEA NRT
vector magnetograms are used in this study from the time period 2012–2016.

Figure 1 shows the heliographic coordinates of the vector magnetograms at Tobs
in the co-aligned pairs (panel a) as well as the distributions of heliographic longi-
tudes (panel b1), heliographic latitudes (panel b2), Carrington longitudes (panel
b3), and observed years (panel b4). The heliographic coordinates in Figure 1a
are marked with diﬀerent colors on the solar disk depending on the GOES class
of the largest ﬂare assigned to the vector magnetograms during the entire solar
disk passage (no ﬂare, black; C-class, blue; M-class, red; X-class, orange). Note
that 522 (20%) and 84 (3%) of the SHARP pairs produced at least one ﬂare
above C1.0 and M1.0, respectively, within 24 hr following observation.

Maps of shear-ﬂow speed, S, are determined from each derived AR photo-
spheric ﬂow ﬁeld, with Figure 2 showing an example for NOAA 12420. Using the
SHARP Br image observed at 05:54:01 UT on 26 September 2015 (Figure 2a), a
speciﬁc subset of MPILs are found, denoted ⋆MPIL, that exhibit: i) two neigh-
boring pixels in a smoothed Br image (after applying a boxcar average over
6 pixel2) with absolute values greater than 20 G but diﬀerent signs across
6
φ)1/2, greater
an MPIL pixel; ii) horizontal magnetic ﬁeld strength, (B2
than 120 G. Note that strong-gradient, strong-ﬁeld MPILs such as ⋆MPIL have
been considered the most likely places where ﬂare-triggering ﬂux cancellation
and/or ﬂux rope emergence can take place (e.g. Mason and Hoeksema, 2010;
Fang et al., 2012). In Figure 2b, an MPIL and its ⋆MPIL subset are overlaid in
pink and orange, respectively, on a cutout Br image of the entire NOAA 12420
(marked in Figure 2a by the yellow box R1). For the kth pixel on the ⋆MPIL
segment, the unit vector (ˆt) is found in the direction eastward and parallel to
1.5 Mm2 centered on the kth
the best-ﬁt line to ⋆MPIL pixels in an area of 1.5
pixel (shown in Figure 2b as a purple dashed line). Best-ﬁt lines are found via
linear least-squares regression with 2D Gaussian kernel weighting, Wk, of 4 Mm
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) centred on the kth pixel. Next, two weighted
mean vectors are calculated, +v (k) and −v (k), from the horizontal ﬂow-velocity
vectors of pixels with positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes, respectively, in an
15 Mm2 centered on the kth pixel and using the same Gaussian kernel,
area of 15
Wk. Figure 2c shows the horizontal velocity vectors from positive and negative
magnetic ﬂuxes as cyan and red arrows, respectively, as well as +v (k)and −v (k)
with blue and yellow arrows. Shear ﬂow speed at pixel k is then determined as
. Repeating this for all points on the ⋆MPIL segment
S (k) =
results in an AR shear-ﬂow speed map as shown in Figure 2d, while the tilt angle
of ˆt, the magnitude of the velocity vectors +vt and −vt, and S are shown as a
function of pixel along the ⋆MPIL in Figure 2e–g, respectively.

3. Results

Three shear ﬂow parameters are calculated to examine the relation between AR
photospheric ﬂows and ﬂare occurrence: the mean (< S >), maximum (Smax),
and integral (Ssum) of S along ⋆MPILs. In addition, the mean horizontal and
20 Mm of ⋆MPILs (< vh > and < vz >, respec-
vertical ﬂow speeds within
tively) are calculated, alongside the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (Φ) in the
entire SHARP FOV for reference. Note that < S >, Smax, < vh > and < vz > are

Ssum has an extensive character only in case an AR possesses ⋆MPIL. On the
other hand, Φ is an extensive parameter regardless of the morphology of ARs:
i.e. the larger the AR in size, the larger the value of Φ.

Active region photospheric shear ﬂows and ﬂares

SHARP image pair data are also overplotted in each panel of Figure 3, namely:
1) those having at least one ﬂare above C1.0 assigned within 24 hr following
the observation time Tobs (blue bars) and 2) those with at least one ﬂare above
M1.0 (red bars). In general, it is found that most histograms in Figure 3 show a
log-normal-like distribution with tails toward larger parameter values (i.e. right-
skewed). The distributions of the ﬂow parameters for the entire SHARP data
set show a peak or high frequency at the bin which includes zero values. This
is mainly due to the fact that there is a considerably large number of SHARP
image pairs containing no ⋆MPILs, resulting in ﬂow parameter values of zero
being recorded. On the other hand, in the case of the ﬂare-associated SHARP
subsets (in particular, for the major-ﬂaring ARs marked with red bars), we ﬁnd
that a peak of the histograms appears at a bin with large parameter values
(i.e. located 3–5 bins away from the zero-value bin). Similar to the shear ﬂow
parameters, Φ follows a log-normal-like, right-skewed distribution.

Fractions of ARs producing at least one ﬂare in the next 24 hr are derived
from the histograms in Figure 3, calculated as the ratio of the number of ﬂaring
SHARP images pairs (blue or red bars for greater than C1.0 or M1.0, respec-
tively) to the total number of SHARP images pairs in each parameter bin (NAR,
gray bars). Figure 4 represents these distributions of ﬂaring-AR fractions in
percentage terms for above C1.0 (blue bars) and M1.0 levels (red bars) for each
of the six parameters. In general, the distributions of ﬂaring-AR fractions can
be characterized as follows:

A remarkable ﬁnding is that the larger the value of the parameter Ssum an AR
has, the more likely it is for the AR to produce at least one C-, M-, or X-class
ﬂare within 24 hr. In addition, ﬂaring-AR fractions as a function of each intensive
ﬂow parameter have relatively much smaller values compared to those of Ssum.
Flaring rates in the next 24 hr are achieved by dividing the total numbers
of ﬂares above C1.0 and M1.0 from ARs in each parameter bin (i.e. N≥C1 and
N≥M1, respectively) by the number of ARs in each parameter bin NAR. The
resulting 24-hour ﬂaring rates, R≥C1 and R≥M1, are displayed in Figure 5 and
Figure 6, respectively. Note that the uncertainties in ﬂaring rates indicated in
1σ Poisson error, calculated as 1/√NAR for each

parameters (panels a, b, d and e in Figures 5 and 6) as well as Φ (panel f) are
very similar to those of the ﬂaring-AR fractions shown in Figure 4. However,
24-hour ﬂaring rates for Ssum show diﬀerent characteristics to their ﬂaring-AR
fractions, i.e. over the entire parameter range, 24-hour ﬂaring rates above C1.0
and M1.0 show a consistently increasing trend in the form of a linear and an
exponential function, respectively. Both best-ﬁt curves, with weights of √NAR,
are shown in Figures 5c and 6c.

Note that panel c in Figures 5 and 6 includes the line of best-ﬁt for a linear and
exponential function, respectively, derived from least-squares regression using
weights of √NAR. From these distributions of 24-hour ﬂaring rates, we ﬁnd that:

Tobs, ii) ARs with increasingly larger values of Ssum and Φ produce increasingly
more ﬂares within 24 hr. In the case of R≥M1, this trend is more clearly shown
for Ssum, and iii) the 24-hour ﬂaring rates above C1.0 and M1.0 as a function

The relation between point-in-time values of the six parameters and waiting
time (τ ) until the next major ﬂare (taken here as above M1.0) is also investigated.
To achieve this, a total of 1,223 SHARP image pairs are chosen containing ARs
that produced at least one ﬂare above M1.0 after their SHARP observation times
(Tobs). Figure 7 shows box and whisker plots of τ for subsets of the selected
1,223 major-ﬂare associated SHARP image pairs in the same parameter bins

in each parameter bin are denoted by the lower whisker, bottom of the box,
band inside the box, top of the box, and upper whisker, respectively. In contrast
to the other four parameters that appear to have no systematic dependence
of τ , if an AR in the major-ﬂare associated subset has relatively large values
of Ssum or Φ, then τ for the next major ﬂare from the AR tends to smaller
time scales. However, this behavior is most clearly shown for Ssum. For example,
20 km s−1 Mm produced a major
81% of ARs in the data set having Ssum
ﬂare within 24 hr from the parameter observation time. In other words, large
ARs consisting of either small ⋆MPILs with strong shear ﬂows or long ⋆MPILs
with at least moderate shear ﬂows (i.e. both leading to large Ssum) seldom

produced at least one ﬂare above M1.0 after the parameter measurement are classiﬁed into the
same parameter bins as shown in Figures 3-6. Whiskers extend to the 2nd (lower) and 98th
percentiles (upper), boxes extend from the 25th (lower edge) to the 75th percentiles (upper

We also ﬁnd that the median τ values (in unit of days) in the Ssum parameter
bins (in unit of 101 km s−1 Mm) are well ﬁt by the exponential function τ =
4.89 exp (
0.98 Ssum). The exponential ﬁt is marked by the solid line in Figure 7c.
This suggests that Ssum might be practically useful for making probabilistic
predictions about when the next tentative major ﬂare will occur, as well as
possibly distinguishing between ﬂaring and ﬂare-quiet time periods as a function

Here, Ssum presents the best ﬂaring-potential diagnostics among the parame-

understand whether or not these two parameters can be used as complementary
parameters in relation to ﬂare occurrence. Figure 8 shows scatter plots of Ssum

vs. Φ (panel a1) and τ vs. Φ (panel b1) for the 296 SHARP image pairs having
at least one major ﬂare (i.e. above M1.0) after the SHARP observation times
(Tobs). Ssum and Φ are moderately correlated with each other in a positive linear-
like fashion, but display a signiﬁcant degree of scatter with a linear (Pearson)
correlation coeﬃcient (CC) equal to 0.54. Panel b1 of Figure 8 shows that among
1023 Mx, relatively larger
ARs with values of Φ in a given range, e.g. (0.2
values of Ssum (represented by data point colors) tend to correspond to shorter
values of τ . For a subset of ARs having values smaller than the median Φ (i.e.
1023 Mx) of the entire 296 ARs, it is also found that the mean of Ssum is
0.43
1.8 times larger in the case of ARs with τ
24 hr compared to the other case of
those with τ > 24 hr. This implies that Ssum and Φ are not exactly duplicated
measures with respect to their relations with τ , but could conceivably be jointly
used for better understanding of AR ﬂaring activity. In the same context, we
examine how signiﬁcantly Ssum is correlated with R or LWLSG which are well-
known, ﬂare-prediction parameters related to the length of ⋆MPIL, but derived
from photospheric LOS magnetograms at single points in time. As shown in
the panels a2 and a3 of Figure 8, Ssum shows a fairly good, positive, linear
correlation with R and LWLSG, respectively, with CCs of 0.71 and 0.68. However,
there are several data points that deviate from the linear least-squares regression
lines (denoted by the dashed lines). Interestingly, ARs with very small values
104 G) of LWLSG but with relatively large values (greater than
(less than 0.5
5 km s−1 Mm) of Ssum tend to produce major ﬂares soon (i.e. shorter τ ). A
similar trend is also found in the case of R. In addition, among ARs with values
104 G) of the entire 296 ARs, the ones
smaller than the median LWLSG (1.56
that produce a major ﬂare in the next 24 hr (i.e. τ
24 hr) have Ssum 1.6 times
larger on average than the others. It is therefore evident that Ssum can provide
an additional and/or supplementary information about ﬂare occurrence beyond
what is provided by Φ, R or LWLSG.

4. Summary and Discussion

In this study, AR photospheric plasma ﬂow ﬁeld maps are determined by ap-
plying the DAVE4VM method to 2,548 co-aligned pairs of SHARP vector mag-
netograms with time separations of 12 min over the period 2012–2016. From
each AR ﬂow ﬁeld map, the derived shear-ﬂow parameters < S >, Smax, and
Ssum respectively represent the mean, maximum, and integral of shear-ﬂow
speeds along a strong-gradient, strong-ﬁeld MPIL subset, ⋆MPIL. In addition,
the mean horizontal and vertical ﬂow speeds around ⋆MPILs are calculated as
< vh > and < vz >, respectively, as well as the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux Φ.
These parameters have been systematically investigated with the large data set
of the AR vector magnetograms, for the ﬁrst time, to ﬁnd out their relation to
properties of ﬂare occurrence such as ﬂaring rates in the next 24 hr and waiting
time τ to next major ﬂare (i.e. above M1.0). As a result, it is found that:

1. The larger the value of Ssum, the more likely it is for the AR to produce ﬂares

within 24 hr.

Park et al.

2. In ARs that produce at least one ﬂare above M1.0, larger values of Ssum

indicate that waiting times τ until the next major ﬂare are shorter.

3. Both ﬂaring rates and τ can be ﬁtted by regression curves that are functions

of Ssum.

Through this study on photospheric shear ﬂows in ARs, we conclude that, in
general, large ARs consisting of either small ⋆MPILs with strong shear ﬂows
or long ⋆MPILs with at least moderate shear ﬂows seldom remain ﬂare quiet,
instead they produce major ﬂares on short time scales. We emphasize that some
of the shear ﬂow parameters for a given AR, in particular Ssum, could be used for
ﬂare forecasting, such as how likely the AR will be ﬂare quiet or ﬂare productive
within 24 hr, or tentatively when the next ﬂare will occur if the AR has a high
chance of producing a ﬂare. For example, a ﬂare forecasting method relying on
Ssum could be implemented to produce ﬂare probabilities under the assumption
of Poisson statistics and using the best-ﬁt functional forms of 24-hour ﬂaring
rates R≥C1 and R≥M1 reported in Section 3 that depend on Ssum. It is also
worthwhile to mention that the ﬂow parameters are derived from a pair of AR
magnetic ﬁeld data at diﬀerent points in time, which takes into account the
temporal evolution of AR photospheric magnetic ﬁelds. Note that most AR
properties currently used for ﬂare prediction are derived from photospheric LOS
and vector magnetograms at single points in time (see, e.g., Leka and Barnes,
2007; Bobra and Couvidat, 2015; Barnes et al., 2016).

Flaring-AR fractions as a function of Φ show similar, but less clear, trends to
those as a function of Ssum. Although it is found that Ssum and Φ are moder-
ately correlated, they only achieve a Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of 0.54. This
implies that Ssum and Φ can be used as complementary parameters in relation
to ﬂare occurrence. It has been reported that Φ is a useful baseline predictor
for ﬂare forecasting with well-known caveats, namely that it depends almost
entirely on the size of ARs but is insensitive to the detailed magnetic structure
of ARs (see, e.g., Leka and Barnes, 2003; Georgoulis, 2012; Barnes et al., 2016).
Hence, any viable ﬂare predictor must be shown to work better than Φ. In this
study no ﬂare predictions are made from the parameters studied, so it will be
interesting to investigate whether Ssum or some combination of the investigated
ﬂow parameters are more successful in ﬂare prediction than Φ.

It has been shown in the numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
Manchester (2008) that shear ﬂows can be produced by the Lorentz (i.e. tension)
force in an emerging twisted magnetic ﬂux rope. Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c
(2012) also found that strong and systematic non-neutralized currents are formed
in NOAA 10930 only along ⋆MPIL segments (see also Kontogiannis et al., 2017).
These suggest that the Lorentz force in ⋆MPIL may be the most natural cause
of shear ﬂows and associated magnetic shear. Emerging ﬂux, possibly evolving
into ﬂux rope formation, is thought to play a crucial role in supplying free
magnetic energy into the AR corona as an energy source for ﬂares and coronal
mass ejections (e.g. Fan, 2005; Kazachenko et al., 2015; Fan, 2016), as well as
in triggering these events (e.g. Chen and Shibata, 2000; Kusano et al., 2012;
Park et al., 2013; Yang, Guo, and Ding, 2015, 2016). Therefore, the shear-ﬂow
parameters and their relation to ﬂare occurrence as examined in this study may

Active region photospheric shear ﬂows and ﬂares

somehow be implicated with the emergence of ﬂux ropes in ARs. This needs
to be precisely studied in terms of whether shear-ﬂow parameters pertain to
characteristics of emerging ﬂux ropes. In addition, the temporal evolution of
shear-ﬂow parameters could be of particular interest in terms of the trigger and
eruption mechanism(s) of AR ﬂux ropes. Further studies, including superposed
epoch analysis of shear-ﬂow evolution in ﬂaring ARs, will help to more precisely
understand the physics underlying ﬂare energy build-up along with the role of
AR shear ﬂows in triggering ﬂares and/or driving eruptive instabilities. For the
time being, Ssum has been included as a potential ﬂare predictor in the Euro-
pean Union’s Horizon 2020 Flare Likelihood And Region Eruption foreCASTing
(FLARECAST) project (http://ﬂarecast.eu).
