Background: Neutrinos in the low–energy regime provide a gateway to a wealth of interesting physics. While
plenty of literature exists on detailing the calculation and measurement of total reaction strengths, relatively little
attention is paid to the measurement and modeling of the ﬁnal lepton through diﬀerential cross sections at low
energies, despite the experimental importance.

Purpose: We calculate diﬀerential cross sections for low–energy neutrino–nucleus scattering. We examine the
role played by forbidden transitions in these distributions and how this diﬀers across diﬀerent energies and nuclear
target masses. Attention is also paid to predictions for typical experimental neutrino spectra.

Method: The diﬀerential cross sections are calculated within a Continuum Random Phase Approximation frame-
work, which allows us to include collective excitations induced by long–range correlations. The Coulomb interac-
tion of the ﬁnal lepton in charged current events is treated in an eﬀective way.
Results: Kinematic distributions are calculated for 16O, 40Ar and 208Pb. 40Ar model results are compared for
CC (νe, e−) reactions to events generated by the MARLEY event generator [1], with noticeable discrepancies.
Conclusion: Forbidden transitions have a marked eﬀect on the kinematic distributions of the ﬁnal lepton at
low–energy kinematics, such as for DAR neutrinos or for a Fermi–Dirac spectrum at low temperature. This
could introduce biases in experimental analyses. Backwards scattering is noticeably more prominent than with
MARLEY.

INTRODUCTION

In recent times, neutrino physics has provided an ex-
citing and rich area of research, with plenty of open ques-
tions either partially or completely unanswered. Ma-
jor examples of these include the absolute mass hierar-
chy, the CP–violating phase and the possible existence
of a fourth ’sterile’ neutrino. Besides these fundamental
high–energy physics issues, neutrinos are also important
in other areas, such as e.g. cosmology, where the mass
of the neutrinos could have an eﬀect on the expansion of
our universe [2].
Of particular note is the role that neutrinos play in the
realm of astrophysics. Here, the existence of massive neu-
trinos would e.g. have an eﬀect on galaxy formation [3].
They’re also an important part of supernovae, the explo-
sive end to a suﬃciently massive star’s life cycle. In this
process, neutrinos are produced in copious quantities in
various ﬂavors: electron neutrinos through the electron
capture during core collapse and subsequent ’burst’ as
well as pair–produced neutrinos during the cool–down of
the remnant protoneutron star. The energy carried by
these neutrinos represents the biggest part of the star’s
gravitational binding energy, with the energy spectrum
of the neutrinos being in the 10s of MeV range. An ex-
act modeling of supernovae is highly dependent on the
properties mentioned above, with the outgoing neutrino
spectra depending both on the absolute mass hierarchy

and oscillations with the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein
(MSW) eﬀect inside the exploding star [4]. Interactions
with nuclei, both charged–current and neutral current,
will also inﬂuence these phenomenae, as well as have an
eﬀect on the nucleosynthesis that takes place in the su-
pernovae envelope [5].
Experimental eﬀorts have been and will be under-
taken to detect supernova neutrinos in the past, present
and future. The Deep Underground Neutrino Exper-
iment (DUNE), as well as e.g. JUNO [6] and Hyper-
Kamiokande [7] aim to make high–precision studies. The
former will have the capacity to distinguish between
the two possible neutrino mass hierarchies through de-
tection of supernova neutrinos [4], as part of its low-
energy program. Furthermore, through these signals, ex-
periments could also very well unveil Beyond–Standard
Model (BSM) physics, such as e.g. the aforementioned
sterile neutrinos. DUNE will make use of a Liquid Argon
Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) as detector. Since
supernovae are not available on demand, a more readily
available source of low–energy neutrinos is required. This
is e.g. possible at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)
at Oakridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [8], which pro-
vides an more readily available source of neutrinos of sim-
ilar energies created out of pions decaying at rest, to per-
form measurements.
All of the experiments mentioned, as well as those per-
formed in the past such as LSND and KARMEN [9, 10],
have the neutrinos scattering oﬀ atomic nuclei (40Ar for
DUNE). It is therefore paramount that eﬀorts are un-
dertaken to provide an adequate theoretical modeling of
the cross sections describing these processes for both NC

for CC interactions scattering and (cid:0) GF
in the case of
NC interactions. GF is the Fermi constant, which en-
codes the strength of the weak interaction, with cos θc
the cosine of the Cabibbo angle. The factor ζ 2(Z (cid:48), Ef )
accounts for the Coulomb interaction between the escap-
ing lepton and the residual nucleus in case the reaction
is CC, which we will come back to shortly. The

diﬀers between the case of neutrino and antineutrino as
a result of the parity–breaking nature of the weak in-
teraction, which depends on the neutrino’s helicity. The

and CC events. Not only are they crucial in the analyses
of these experiments, but they are also needed to model
the interaction of outgoing neutrinos in supernovae with
the nuclei in the star and the subsequent nucleosynthesis.
This is not trivial, as the nuclear response to low–energy
neutrinos is highly dependent on the details of nuclear
structure, and the description of the excitated states.
While theoretical literature [11–39] pertaining to low–
energy neutrino interactions with nuclei is rich with detail
on the calculations of total cross sections, the amount of
attention paid to the description of the ﬁnal lepton’s kine-
matics, is comparatively modest. This stands in contrast
with research performed in the medium energy range (few
100 MeV to a few GeV), where lepton kinematics are a
key ingredient in the analyses: they are needed in the en-
ergy reconstruction process [40]. Furthermore, inclusive
diﬀerential cross sections only require the detection of
the charged lepton, and can provide a powerful tool with
which to scrutinize theoretical models in the low–energy
regime. We will therefore focus this paper on diﬀerential
cross sections which contain information on the outgoing
lepton’s kinematics, such as scattering angle, for low–
energy CC and NC neutrinos in a CRPA approach, with
a focus on 40Ar.

II. MODEL

We now cover the theoretical ingredients employed in
our calculations. The cross section for electroweak scat-
tering of neutrinos oﬀ atomic nuclei in the Giant Reso-
nance (GR) and quasielastic (QE) regime is given by the
following expression:

where F1 and GA are the Fermi and axial form factors,
respectively. These operators are the well–known Fermi
and Gamow–Teller transition operators. The AA is
an adequate description of the nucleus’ response to
an electroweak probe at low energies. Because they
are responsible for the largest part of the reaction
strength in this kinematic regime, they give rise to
the ’allowed’ transitions with the well–known selection
rules through operators with J P quantum numbers
of 0+ and 1+, respectively. Higher–order transitions,
to draw a contrast, are often refered to as ’forbidden’
transitions. In this work, the responses are calculated in
the Continuum Random Phase Approximation (CRPA),
where long–range correlations and collective excitations
of the nucleus are taken into account. This scheme has
seen succesful applications in the past. The details of
how this approach can be used to calculate the nuclear
response functions can be found in Refs. [28, 42–52].
Keeping in line with these previous works, we make
use of the free-nucleon value for the axial coupling of
gA = 1.27. Some models use the ’quenched’ gA = 1.00 as
detailed in Ref. [53], where it is shown that this eﬀective
value is needed due to the model space being truncated
as well as not fully taking into account the eﬀects of
nuclear correlations.

At low energies, for CC interactions, the Coulomb at-
traction or repulsion between the residual nucleus and the
outgoing lepton has a large eﬀect on the cross section and
needs to be properly accounted for. In principle, this can
be achieved by considering the asymptotic lepton wave
function as a sum of distorted partial waves, calculated in
a Coulomb potential. If one only takes the S–wave into
account (valid at low outgoing lepton momentum pf ),
the ratio between the distorted and undistorted S–wave
leads to the Fermi function [54]:

once the lepton’s outgoing momentum becomes appre-
ciably high [54]. The modiﬁed eﬀective momentum ap-
proximation, detailed in Ref. [54], can be used in such a
regime. This semi–classical approach consists of shifting
the energy and momentum of the ﬁnal lepton to an ef-
fective value by the Coulomb energy in the center of the

In practice, we will
interpolate between these two
schemes that consists of taking the value of ζ(Z (cid:48), Ef )2
that is closest to unity. This corresponds to taking the
Fermi function for low pf , and using MEMA at higher pf .

The framework described above has the attractive
property of providing a model that can be employed for
a broad range of energies. It is capable of describing the
Giant Resonance region, dominated by collective excita-
tions, but can also (as discussed in Refs. [49–51]) describe
the quasielastic peak for higher energy regimes such as
those seen in experiments such as T2K, MiniBooNE and
MicroBooNE. Previous work on the topic of the interac-
tions low–energy neutrino with nuclei such as 40Ar in the
CRPA framework, including comparison with other mod-
els and Gamow–Teller strengths can be found in Ref. [52].

III. RESULTS

We begin our discussion by taking a look at CRPA
diﬀerential cross section predictions for a variety of kine-
matical conditions applicable to low–energy scenarios.
Shown in Figure 2 are the double diﬀerential cross sec-
tions calculated for charged–current (CC) neutrinos scat-
tering oﬀ 40Ar, as a function of the outgoing electron’s
kinetic energy Tf and its scattering angle cos θf . As the
energy increases, more resonance peaks show up as an
increasing number of excitations becomes accessible. We
can also integrate out the lepton’s kinetic energy, and fo-
cus on the single diﬀerential cross sections as a function of
the direction the outgoing lepton scattering angle cos θf
in Figures 3 to 6. These plots present results for CC and

NC reactions, for both neutrinos and antineutrinos, for
incoming energies of 30, 50 and 70 MeV. In doing so, we
can now show the separated contributions coming from
the individual multipole moments of the nuclear current.
While working in the AA is fair at 30 MeV in the
case of neutrino–induced CC events, the forbidden tran-
sitions are needed to capture the full reaction strength

for antineutrino–induced reactions, NC interactions and
especially at higher energies for all channels. We men-
tion at this stage that the 0+ and 0− transitions con-
tribute only minimally to the total reaction strength and
are not shown separately, to improve the overal clarity
of the plots. The Fermi transitions induced by these op-
erators are not included in the CRPA results, as it only
contains the continuous part of the excitation spectrum.

Moreover, one can also appreciate the shape diﬀerence
in the angular distribution between the 1+ contribution
and the total diﬀerential cross section. We can also cal-
culate these distributions for other nuclei.
In compar-
ing Figs. 3, 7 and 8, two things become clear concerning
the A–dependence of the angular distributions. Firstly,
we aﬃrm the general expected trend that the number
of multipoles needed for a satisfactory convergence of
the diﬀerential cross section increases with the incom-

ing energy of the neutrino and also with the increasing
mass of the struck nucleus. A second observation we note
is the qualitative way in which the angular distribution
changes across energy and nuclear mass. Generally, the
main feature is for these diﬀerential cross sections to be
dominated by backward scattering. At the lowest ener-
gies, this is especially the case, but gradually less so as
the energy increases. Similarly, the higher the mass of
the struck nucleus, the less the diﬀerential cross section

16O and 40Ar paint quite a diﬀerent picture from 208Pb,
whichwhere cross sections peaks around cos θf ≈
To get a better sense as to how big this shape diﬀer-
ence has an eﬀect in an experimental context, one can
take a look at angular distributions folded with neutrino
spectra, such as those yielded by pion decay–at–rest, or
in the case of supernova neutrinos, a Fermi–Dirac distri-
bution at various temperatures. We show the former for

induced CC, since this is kinematically inaccessible. (The
DAR spectrum only contains muon–antineutrinos, with
not enough phase space available for an outgoing massive
muon in the regimes discussed in this work.) The results
are shown in Figures 9 to 11. The AA predicts that
leptons will be emitted from the reaction nearly isotrop-
ically. Taking forbidden transitions into account changes
this picture, and shows that backward scattering is en-

hanced signiﬁcantly, deviating strongly from the isotropic
behavior of the AA contributions.

Finally, we will compare these results with those of
MARLEY (Modeling of Argon Reaction Low–energy
Yields), a Monte Carlo (MC) event generator aimed at
simulating neutrino–induced CC reactions on Argon for
low–energy neutrinos [1]. This comparison is done in
Figs. 12, 13 and 14.

These ﬁgures show that working in the allowed ap-

proximation, again, yields distributions that are approx-
imately isotropical. This, too, is predicted by the MAR-
LEY generator. The only exception seems to be at 25
MeV, where the MC distribution diﬀers quite signiﬁ-
cantly from the CRPA predictions. As discrete excita-
tions important at lower energies are not included in the
CRPA spectrum, this is not surprising. At higher ener-
gies, the diﬀerence between the AA and the full CRPA
model shows that including forbidden transitions causes
the angular distribution to skew further towards back-
wards scattering. These forbidden transitions are not

the experimental analyses, and should be taken into ac-
count. Following on from this discussion on angular dis-
tributions, one can also look at the distributions in terms
of the ﬁnal lepton’s kinetic energy Tf . We do so for CC
neutrino–argon scattering at several energies in Fig. 15,
where the diﬀerential cross section as a function of Tf is
plotted with the individual multipole contributions sep-
arated, similar to Fig. 3. The conclusions are of course
the same, except that the shape diﬀerences in the dis-
tributions as a consequence of forbidden transitions are
even more remarkable here. We can now compare these
to MARLEY predictions, where we can make an explicit
distinction between the discrete and continuous excita-
tions. This is shown in Fig. 16. In this ﬁgure it is shown
that, while the CRPA model does not model the discrete
excitations, there is a shift towards lower kinetic energies
for the outgoing lepton present in the CRPA model. As
is shown in Fig. 15, caused almost exclusively by the con-
tribution of forbidden transitions. This discrepancy gets
worse as the energy increases. To get a sense of the ef-
fect this has on the signals in experimental situation, we
show the normalized strength distribution for two Fermi–
Dirac neutrino spectra, for two temperatures 6 K and 10
K in Fig. 17. While the CRPA model and the MARLEY
results match favorably for the low–temperature spec-
trum, the higher one will start to show the eﬀect of the
previously mentioned discrepancy of having more low Tf
events in the CRPA (see Fig. 16) due to forbidden transi-
tions. Furthermore, contrary to our approach MARLEY
extrapolates the matrix elements for the discrete low–
energy transitions to higher energies without accounting
for the q–dependence. This introduces a bias in e.g. en-
ergy reconstruction in experimental analyses, and should
therefore be included.

IV. SUMMARY

With Argon an important future target for low–energy
neutrinos, we have presented diﬀerential cross section re-
sults for neutrino scattering, with a focus on 40Ar nu-
clei. The CRPA approach used here allows us to include
the eﬀects of long–range correlations and collectivity in
the nuclear response. In this work we have focused on

FIG. 11. The diﬀerential NC (¯ν,40Ar) cross section as a func-
tion of lepton scattering angle cos θf for a DAR antineutrino
energy spectrum, with the allowed approximation shown sep-
arately.

the angular distributions of the ﬁnal lepton created in
this process.
In doing so, we found that while forbid-
den transitions not only contribute non–trivially to the
overal reaction strength, they also cause a re-shaping of
the outgoing lepton’s angular and kinetic energy distribu-
tions. This is demonstrated for several neutrino spectra,
and compared with the MARLEY MC generator, which
lacks forbidden transition modeling. Incorporating these
could greatly improve on the quality of predictions and
analyses.
