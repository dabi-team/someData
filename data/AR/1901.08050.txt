Diﬀerences between νe and νµ quasielastic cross sections are essential in neutrino oscillation
analyses and CP violation searches for experiments such as DUNE and T2HK. The ratio of these
is however poorly known experimentally and for certain kinematic regions theoretical models give
contradictory answers. We use two independent mean-ﬁeld based models to investigate this ratio
using 40Ar and 12C targets. We demonstrate that a proper treatment of the ﬁnal nucleon’s wave
function conﬁrms the dominance of νµ over νe induced cross sections at forward lepton scattering.

In recent years, the quest to elucidate issues concerning
neutrino oscillation parameters, the existence of sterile
neutrinos, and CP violation has resulted in a worldwide
boom in neutrino experiments and collaborations [1, 2].
Accelerator-based oscillation experiments such as Mini-
BooNE, T2K, MicroBooNE, and the upcoming DUNE
and T2HK facilities [3–8] rely on neutrino scattering oﬀ
atomic nuclei in order to detect them in their near and
far detectors. A reliable determination of the neutrino-
nucleus cross section is hence pivotal for energy recon-
struction and oscillation analyses. Theoretical analyses
are equally important for dedicated neutrino-nucleus ex-
periments such as e.g. MINERνA [9].
In view of the
determination of oscillation parameters, and in particu-
lar the CP-violating phase, an accurate knowledge of νe,
νµ and νe, νµ cross sections over a large kinematic re-
gion is indispensable. The diﬀerences between νe and νµ
induced cross sections have been puzzling the commu-
nity for the last couple of years [10–13], as it is crucial
for the interpretation of the low-energy νe excess [3] and
for investigations of the neutrino mass hierarchy and the
CP-violating phase δCP [1, 5].

In Ref. [11] we have shown that the calculated ratio
σνe /σνµ shows important model dependencies. While
models agree that electron neutrinos induce larger to-
tal cross sections than muon neutrinos [10, 12], the
picture can be radically diﬀerent for speciﬁc kinemat-
ics. Evaluating cross sections in a mean-ﬁeld based
Hartree-Fock continuum random phase approximation
(HF-CRPA) model, we found that for reactions at for-
ward lepton scattering angles, surprisingly charged cur-
rent muon neutrino-induced interactions show larger

cross sections than their electron neutrino counterparts
[11]. In Ref. [10] it was argued that a νµ dominance could
be an artifact of an incomplete treatment of the phase
space available to the interaction. This could e.g aﬀect
processes studied with a Fermi gas model, as commonly
done in experimental analyses. Meanwhile, the question
of which cross section is the larger one at speciﬁc kine-
matics remained unanswered.

In this Letter, we examine the eﬀect of ﬁnal-state dis-
tortion in the modeling of the cross section on this prob-
lem and show that a proper treatment of the distortion
of the outgoing nucleon’s wave function resolves the is-
sue. Using two diﬀerent models and independent codes
we demonstrate that describing the reaction with a cross
section model that includes nucleon wave functions cal-
culated in a nuclear potential instead of unbound plane
waves reveals that νµ induced cross sections can indeed
be larger than their νe counterparts at forward lepton
kinematics. Approximating the outgoing nucleon’s wave
function by a plane wave description, which introduces
inaccuracies related to Pauli blocking and orthogonal-
ity issues, results in a considerable overestimation of the
responses at low energies and forward lepton scattering
angles [14]. This kinematic region is especially relevant
for the T2K experiment where the oscillated νµ signal
peaks around 300 MeV [5] and the low-energy excess
of electron-like events found predominantly for forward
scattering angles in the MiniBooNE experiment [3].

This Letter is organized as follows: ﬁrst we show
that in mean-ﬁeld approaches which include distortion
of the ﬁnal nucleon, the νµ induced cross section is in-
deed larger than its νe counterpart in certain kinematic
regions. Then the inﬂuence of the kinematics of the pro-
cess on these cross sections is reviewed, and ﬁnally we
show that a proper description of Pauli blocking plays
an essential role in this eﬀect.

FIG. 1. CRPA (full lines) and RMF (dashed) cross sections for diﬀerent incoming neutrino energies for a lepton scattering
angle of θl = 5◦ for muon (thick lines) and electron neutrino (thin lines) induced interactions with 12C.

The ﬁrst approach used in this work, the HF-CRPA
model, is based on a mean-ﬁeld ansatz where the bound-
state wave functions are obtained through a Hartree-
Fock calculation with a Skyrme interaction [15, 16]. The
ﬁnal-state nucleon is described with a continuum wave
function obtained using the same potential to describe
the interaction with the residual system. Long-range
correlations are taken into account through a random-
phase approximation approach using the same Skyrme
parametrization as residual
interaction [16–18]. The
width of the nucleon states is taken into account in an
eﬀective way, folding responses with a Lorentzian [19].
In this formalism, the nuclear dynamics are treated in
a non-relativistic way, and relativized using the eﬀective
procedure proposed in Ref.
[20]. The HF-CRPA ap-
proach has been successfully applied to the description of
various electroweak scattering processes [16, 17, 19, 21–
23]. Short-range correlation eﬀects are very small at the
kinematics of interest [10, 24].

The second model is the relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF)
model for quasielastic one-nucleon knock-out, where the
initial and ﬁnal state nucleon single-particle wave func-
tions are obtained as solutions of the Dirac equation with
a mean ﬁeld potential. The potential is obtained by a
self-consistent calculation with a nucleon-nucleon inter-
action described by a Lagrangian which includes meson
ﬁelds to parameterize the coupling [25, 26]. It has been
shown that the RMF model describes well inclusive elec-
tron scattering oﬀ nuclei [27–30].

In both approaches, the outgoing wave function is com-
puted in the same nuclear potential as the one used for
the bound nucleon states, thereby including the essential
feature of orthogonality of initial and ﬁnal state. In this
respect, our models contrast with other approaches that
ignore secondary interactions of the outgoing nucleon.

The RMF and HF-CRPA charged current quasi-elastic
(CCQE) cross sections for a selected set of kinematic con-

ditions with small energy and momentum transfers are
shown in Fig. 1. Although giant resonances cannot be
reproduced with the RMF model, its basic features agree
well with the HF-CRPA results, in particular conﬁrming
the νµ/νe ratios found in [11], with larger cross sections
for the reactions producing the heavier lepton in the ﬁnal
state.

The fact that cross sections producing a relatively
heavy muon in the ﬁnal state can be larger than the
ones with a light outgoing electron at the same incoming
energy, scattering angle and energy transfer, may seem
counter-intuitive, but should in fact not be so surprising.
Looking into the kinematics of the reaction, it becomes
clear that for forward lepton scattering angles, at a given
energy transfer ω, the corresponding momentum transfer
q is larger for muon neutrinos than for electron neutrinos
exactly because the former reaction generates a charged
lepton with a larger mass. Indeed, for forward scattering
1), the momentum transferred to the
kinematics (cos θl ≈
nucleus by a neutrino with incoming energy Eν that in
the charged-current process transforms into a lepton with
mass ml and momentum Pl, is for ﬁxed energy transfer

and hence increases with growing lepton mass. The
struck nucleon receives a smaller momentum q from the
electron neutrino than in a muon neutrino-induced inter-
action. This brings along larger nuclear responses R(q, ω)
for muon neutrinos. The lepton kinematic factors that
are combined with the responses [19, 31, 32] to construct
the cross section generally tend to favor smaller lepton
masses in the forward scattering region, but this eﬀect is
not large enough to neutralize the dominance of the νµ
responses [30, 33]. This leads to higher cross sections for
reactions induced by muon neutrinos, the larger lepton

neutrino energy of 200 MeV, for neutrinos in panels (a)-(c) and antineutrinos in panels (d)-(f). The momentum transferred

mass in the ﬁnal state notwithstanding. Due to their ge-
ometry, near detectors tend to be sensitive mostly to for-
ward lepton scattering events. The eﬀect observed here
is therefore not marginal but could strongly inﬂuence to-
tal rates if the angular dependence of the cross section
ratio is not fully taken into account. In this kinematic
region the cross section is extremely sensitive to subtle
nuclear eﬀects that require careful modeling to be fully
understood. The importance of a meticulous analysis,
judging the impact of the diﬀerent mechanisms at play
in the interaction and the nuclear medium, is illustrated
in the following paragraphs.

In Fig. 2, we demonstrate the link between momentum
transfer and cross section, showing the double diﬀerential
cross section for both electron and muon (anti)neutrino
scattering oﬀ argon for a ﬁxed incoming energy, and vari-
ous scattering angles of the charged lepton together with
the momentum transfer in the interaction. For small mo-
mentum transfers the ratio σνµ /σνe can be straightfor-
wardly understood by the diﬀerence of momentum trans-
fers depicted in the panels (g) to (i) of the ﬁgure. The
cross sections are shown for a Hartree-Fock as well as
for a HF plane wave impulse approximation (HF-PWIA)
calculation. As described above, in the former one the

outgoing nucleon wave is distorted by the presence of the
nuclear potential, in the latter one, the wave function is
replaced by a plane wave. Comparing the full HF results
to the HF-PWIA ones, it is obvious that modeling the
distortion induced by the nuclear medium is essential.
For small momentum transfers, a plane-wave treatment
of the nucleon completely passes by the strong inﬂuence
of the nuclear potential on the slow ﬁnal nucleon and
yields far too high responses.

In the following, we will compare RMF with relativis-
tic plane wave impulse approximation (RPWIA) results
and look into the role of Pauli blocking. In an RPWIA
approach, the outgoing nucleon is modeled by a rela-
tivistic plane wave with ﬁxed momentum. On the other
hand, in the RMF approach presented above, the outgo-
ing nucleon has a well-deﬁned energy, but its momentum
is only asymptotically deﬁned. Indeed, only far enough
from the nuclear potential, the wave function behaves as
an on-shell nucleon with well-deﬁned momentum. The
outgoing wave function in the RPWIA hence has a large
component which is non-orthogonal to the bound states
of the nucleus. To illustrate the eﬀect of this on cross
sections, we introduce the Pauli-blocked RPWIA (PB-
RPWIA). In this approach the outgoing nucleon wave

function is described by a relativistic plane wave which
is orthogonalized with respect to the bound states. This
is done by projecting out the overlap with the bound
states [30, 34–36].

In Fig. 3 the RPWIA approach is compared with the

clearly visible, and the results greatly overestimate the
PB-RPWIA cross sections, which reproduce the magni-
tude of the RMF and CRPA cross sections of Fig 1. It
is worth noting that the RPWIA results probe the same
kinematic range as the PB-RPWIA, RMF and HF-CRPA
approaches. In the calculations, no cuts are made in the
phase space, the momentum distribution of the initial-
and ﬁnal-state nucleons are completely determined by
the wave functions. As seen in the HF-PWIA results
above, in the RPWIA the νe cross sections always have
a larger magnitude than the νµ ones. However, once
the spurious non-orthogonal contributions are removed
from the plane wave the situation is reversed for forward
kinematics. In the RMF and HF-CRPA approaches this
eﬀect is naturally implemented because the ﬁnal-state
nucleon is constructed from continuum states, with well-
deﬁned quantum numbers, in the same potential as the
initial state. In this way Pauli-blocking is implemented
in a straightforward quantum mechanical way. This con-
sistency between initial and ﬁnal states is also present
in the Pauli blocked relativistic Fermi gas model, how-
ever the treatment of the nuclear initial and ﬁnal state as
plane waves is unrealistic in this kinematic region. In the
presented approaches nucleons with small momenta can
still be emitted from the nucleus, contrary to in a Fermi
gas, but the treatment of the ﬁnal-state wave function
naturally leads to a strong reduction of the cross section
for slow nucleons.

Figure 4 summarizes our ﬁndings. The left panel shows
the ratio of νe to νµ CRPA cross sections to be smaller
than 1 over a large part of the forward scattering region
for a broad range of incoming energies. The right panel
testiﬁes that this region represents a considerable part of
the scattering strength.

In conclusion, using diﬀerent models and indepen-
dently developed codes, we have shown that taking into
account the distortion of the ﬁnal-state nucleon in the
description of charged-current quasi-elastic neutrino scat-
tering oﬀ atomic nuclei, muon neutrino-induced CCQE
cross sections are larger than the equivalent reaction
caused by an electron neutrino for reactions at small en-
ergy and momentum transfer. Indeed, in this kinematic
regime the nuclear response is extremely sensitive to sub-
tle diﬀerences in energy and momentum transfer, result-
ing in sizable diﬀerences in cross sections. This result
sheds light on existing uncertainties in ratios that are
essential in the analysis of neutrino oscillation and CP
violation searches.
As shown, the eﬀect is robust and cannot be seen as an
artifact of one model. It is present for neutrinos as well as
antineutrinos and manifests itself throughout the nuclear
mass table. It is related to the kinematic peculiarities of
the interaction in this regime. An incomplete treatment
of the distortion of the ﬁnal nucleon’s wave function and
of Pauli-blocking eﬀects might however obscure the dom-
inance of muon neutrino induced processes over electron
neutrino induced ones. These ﬁndings point to the im-
portance of an appropriate description of nuclear eﬀects
on neutrino-induced cross sections, especially for forward
scattering, and the need for a careful evaluation of the
relevance of various inﬂuences of the nuclear medium on
the interaction.
