(Dated: 14 October 2019)

Here we report on a novel High Harmonic Generation (HHG) light source designed for space charge free
ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) on solids. The ultimate overall energy resolution achieved on a
polycrystalline Au sample is ∼22 meV at 40 K. These results have been obtained at a photon energy of 16.9
eV with a pulse bandwidth of ∼19 meV, by varying, up to 200 kHz, the photon pulses repetition rate and the
photon ﬂuence on the sample. These features set a new benchmark for tunable narrowband HHG sources.
By comparing the PES energy resolution and the photon pulse bandwidth with a pulse duration of ∼105
fs, as retrieved from time-resolved (TR) angle resolved (AR) PES experiments on Bi2Se3, we validate a way
for a space charge free photoelectric process close to Fourier transform limit conditions for ultrafast TR-PES
experiments on solids.

I.

INTRODUCTION

for

Nowadays the expanding quest

studying the
physics of complex and quantum materials under non-
equilibrium conditions has prompted the development of
advanced ultrafast light soources, in order to tailor spe-
ciﬁc excited states and probing their electronic transient
properties. By HHG1–5 light sources, as well as free elec-
tron laser (FEL), it is possible to obtain radiation pulses
with photon energies extending from the extreme ultravi-
olet (EUV) to hard X-rays, with pulse durations ranging
from sub-fs to sub-ps, and fully polarized light. However,
while these sources are suitable for high peak brilliance
experiments, they show severe limits for ultrafast PES
on solids, where the photon density in the light pulses
and the light pulses repetition rate must be controlled in
order to reduce spurious eﬀects.

PES6,7 allows to measure, under perturbative condi-
tion, the spectral function resulting from the projection
of the ﬁnal electronic states on the initial states of the
matter.
In quantum and strongly correlated materials
the collective excitations and the quasi-particles interac-
tions will aﬀect the self-energy, hence the PES spectral
function, which features unveil the eﬀects of these many
body interactions on the kinetic energy and momentum
of the primary photoelectrons. By measuring the kinetic

energy and the momentum of the primary electrons, the
PES experiments can be extended to the reciprocal space,
therefore to the measure of the band dispersion, while
another degree of freedom of the photoelectron can be
observed by detecting its spin.

In the last two decades ARPES and spin resolved (SP)
ARPES have been extended to time domain in the sub ps
regime. Although very challenging, even today, these ex-
periments require stable photon pulses sources (in terms
of energy, polarization, intensity) with duration in the
range of 10-100 fs and with a controlled peak brilliance
and repetition rate. Hence, the number of photons, for
a ﬁxed focal spot on the sample, has to be such that
space charge eﬀects are minimized, while compensating
the limited number of photoelectron per pulse by a repe-
tition rate as high as possible to provide the best signal-
to-noise ratio.

The ideal light source for time-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy should respond to the following character-
i) provide pulses with 103-104 coherent photons
istics:
per pulse in the energy range 6 eV-100 eV and with ∼
100 fs time duration, in order to exploit favorable pho-
toionization matrix elements, while covering the full Bril-
louin zone of all materials; ii) be controllable in terms of
pulse power, pulse duration, and repetition rate; iii) al-
low tunability of the photon energy in a broad range 8–13;
iv) have repetition rate of several tens of kHz, up to
MHz 14–27, but compatible with the relaxation time of
the excited states, in order to avoid the thermal eﬀects
on the sample.

In particular, space charge28–30 can heavily aﬀect the
primary photoelectron kinetic energy and trajectory,
hence limiting the experimental resolution. This is the
most challenging problem in time resolved ARPES ex-
periments.

Here we report on a novel HHG source and setup, that
lays down a new benchmark in terms of repetition rate
(up to 200 kHz), photons per pulse (up to 106), pulse
duration (∼ 100 fs) and an overall energy resolution for
time resolved ARPES of ∼ 22 meV, as measured on a
polycrystalline Au at 40 K. The main characteristics of
this source are summarized in Table I. By comparing the
parameters in Table I with those of equivalent setups in
the literature 5,14,16,18–20,26,31–34, the HHG time resolved
ARPES described herewith below meets the state of the
art in the ﬁeld.

At present, this HHG setup serves alternatively two
complementary end-stations devoted to advanced PES,
Spin Polarization measurements, and ARPES.

II. HHG SOURCE AND PHOTON BEAM OPTICS

A. The laser source

The source is a Yb:KGW-based integrated femtosec-
ond laser system (PHAROS, Light Conversion), charac-
terized by a turn-key operation and by high pulse-to-
pulse stability. The system produces ∼300 fs pulses at
1030 nm, with a tunable repetition rate from single-shot
to 1 MHz. The average power is 20 W above 50 kHz.
The maximal energy-per-pulse, equal to 400 µJ, is avail-
able in the 0-50 kHz interval instead. At >50 kHz, the

energy per pulse is determined by the actual repetition
rate setting; at 1 MHz, 20 µJ/pulse are available. Once
the fundamental repetition rate is set, the corresponding
energy/pulse is provided. From this condition, and us-
ing the laser-cavity Pockels cell, a lower repetition rate
can be set by pulse-picking of the pulses; this possibil-
ity preserves the energy/pulse and is particularly useful
for the optimization of non-linear optical processes, since
the same peak power is available but with a reduced ther-
mal load. The repetition rate tuning ﬂexibility has direct
consequences on experiments, allowing to ﬁnd the ideal

compromise between (probe) signal statistics and (pump-
induced) sample heating. The laser source can seed two
optical parametric ampliﬁers (OPAs), conﬁgured for op-
eration with 40 µJ/pulse or 360 µJ/pulse. They allow for
a tunable output in the range 630-2600 nm (ORPHEUS
HP) and in the range 1350-4500 nm (ORPHEUS ONE
HP), which is also equipped with a DFG crystal to extend
the output up to 16 µm.

B. HHG beamline

The HHG photon beam is propagated to two experi-
mental end-stations designed for PES 31,35. The beam-
line is made up of a generation chamber, monochroma-
tor, and refocalization chamber, and coupled with OPAs
sources for time resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. The
full optical path is reported in ﬁg. 1.

The generation chamber has been designed to work in
the so-called tight-focusing regime, that allows to reach
the 1014 W/cm2 peak power density, required to drive the
HHG process 36,37, also with a pulse duration of ∼300 fs.
A detailed description is reported in the Supplementary
Material.

In standard operating conditions, the HHG process is
seeded by the second harmonics of the laser, at 515 nm.
The frequency duplication of the laser radiation at 1030
nm is obtained with a 2 mm thick Beta Barium Borate
(BBO) nonlinear crystal. The conversion eﬃciency into
515 nm radiation is 50% without beam focusing.

C. Monochromator

The spectral selection of a single harmonics is per-
formed by an oﬀ-plane-mount (OPM) grating monochro-
mator. Diﬀerently from the classical diﬀraction, where
the grating grooves (gr) are perpendicular to the inci-
dent plane, in the oﬀ-plane geometry the incident plane
is almost parallel to the grooves. The main advantage
of such a conﬁguration is the capability to mitigate the
EUV pulse-front tilt after diﬀraction, therefore provid-
ing a lower temporal broadening of the monochroma-
tized pulses38. Furthermore, the oﬀ-plane mount pro-
vides much higher EUV eﬃciency compared to the clas-
sical one39.

The instrument design consists of two toroidal gold
coated mirrors and ﬁve OPM plane gratings (see Supple-
mentary Material). The beam is collimated by a toroidal
mirror onto a speciﬁc grating, and subsequently refocused
onto one of the two exit slits by a toroidal mirror with
identical focal length, in order to select a single harmonic
beam and to steer it in either the SPRINT (Spin Polar-
ized Research Instrument in the Nanoscale and Time)
or T-ReX (Time Resolved X-Ray spectroscopy) end-
stations 40. The mirrors are operated at equal grazing
angle and unity magniﬁcation, in order to minimize the
aberrations at the output. The selection of a speciﬁc

grating determines which end-station is served, without

The gratings parameters have been designed to introduce
a dispersion suﬃcient to isolate a single harmonics with a
slit-width of ∼100 um (adjacent harmonics are separated
by 2.4 eV with 1030 nm seed and 4.8 eV with 515 nm
seed). Since the intrinsic bandwidth of the harmonics is
deﬁnitely lower than the bandwidth transmitted through
the monochromator, the overall energy resolution is lim-

ited by the HHG source itself. Hence, the monochro-
mator is acting as a tunable ﬁlter that is used to select a
single harmonic and ﬁlter out all the adjacent harmonics.
The use of grating gives intrinsically a pulse-front tilt
due to diﬀraction, which introduces a temporal broaden-
ing. The measure of the EUV divergence allows to es-
timate this broadening. The beam divergence has been
measured through the knife-edge technique, resulting in
10 mrad for harmonics in the range 16.9 eV (i.e., 7th
harmonic of 515 nm) to 31.2 eV (i.e., 13th harmonic of
515 nm). The resulting temporal broadening given by
the monochromator because of the pulse-front tilt is in
the range 50-200 fs, typically lower than the expected
duration of the harmonics.

D. Refocusing

The refocusing chamber (see Supplementary Material)
is equipped with a toroidal mirror (see Table II C for
speciﬁcations), which images the monochromatized EUV
beam spot at the slits position onto the sample plane,
with 1:1 ratio. A silver square mirror is placed in the refo-
cusing chamber, to direct the pump beam on the sample.
The pump beam forms a ≈1 degree angle with respect
to the EUV probe pulse. The mirror is mounted on a
piezo-mount to set precisely the pump-probe beam over-
lap. A second square mirror, mounted oﬀ-center on a
stepper motor, can be inserted in the beam path to send
the quasi-collinear pump-probe beams out of the vacuum
chamber. This possibility is used to optimize the beams
focus (note that the pump beam is focused by a lens with
focal length f = 1.5 m, placed before the entrance window
on the refocusing chamber) and to roughly determine the
time-zero condition. To this aim, the pump beam and the
zero-order probe are sent on a fast photodiode recorded
by a 4 GS/s oscilloscope. In this way, time-zero is pre-
determined with a few ps uncertainty and ﬁnally found
directly in the photoemission experiments.

III. RESULTS

Fig. 2 reports the harmonics spectrum as measured by
low energy gratings (150 and 400 gr/mm). Spectra were
recorded under the same generation conditions, namely,
the HHG process is driven by the second-harmonic-
generation (SHG) of the laser output (70 µJ/pulse at
100 kHz and 29 µJ/pulse at 200 kHz; the additional
energy losses after the SHG crystal are due to the op-
tical elements along the beam path), in Argon (4 bar
at nozzle entrance). The spectra have been measured
by scanning the monochromator with 0.05 degrees steps.
The measurement of the photon ﬂux at the output of the
monochromator, after passing the slit with an aperture
of 100 µm, has been performed with an X-ray photodi-
ode, connected to an acquisition board. The conversion
between current and number of photons has been ob-
tained by using an analogue photodiode calibrated at a
synchrotron radiation facility. Each point has been ac-
quired for 5 seconds. The measurements were performed
at full power, at two diﬀerent repetition rates. The num-
ber of photons per second measured in this condition is
≈0.4-1.1x1011 at 100 kHz, and ≈1-6x109 at 200 kHz.

Harmonics generation in Neon with 1030 nm has been
also tested, using a dedicated grating with 1200 gr/mm,
generating up to the 63rd harmonics (not reported), with
a two orders of magnitude lower photon ﬂux.

The EUV focal spot is measured with a Yttrium Alu-
minium Garnet (YAG) crystal placed at the sample po-
sition. The EUV-beam ﬂuorescence is recorded by a
Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera. The horizontal
proﬁle of the EUV spot is ﬁtted by a Gaussian function.
The FWHM is 97 µm, as shown in Fig. 3).

The HHG beamline feeds two end-stations optimised
for complementary PES experiments: a) The T-ReX end-
station, hosting a SPECS electron analyzer equipped
with a Delay Line Detector (DLD), optimized for
time-resolved ARPES experiments. The T-ReX end-
station features a six-degrees of freedom motorized cry-

ments; details of the experimental setup can be found
in 31(http://www.elettra.trieste.it/labs/t-rex.html);
b)
the SPRINT end-station, where standard characteriza-
tion techniques for surface science experiments (LEED,
AES, ion bombardment) and a Scienta SES 2002 electron
energy analyser (EA) are available 35,41. The experimen-
tal chamber also hosts a Vectorial Twin Mott detector
set-up 42 for the measurement of spin polarization of the
full, or partialized, quantum yield from the sample 35,
and a Helium discharge lamp for reference spectra at
21.22 eV with 1 meV bandwidth and analyzer energy
resolution calibration. Selected results obtained in com-
missioning experiments are reported in the following sub-
sections.

A. Space Charge Mitigation

When ultrashort Ultraviolet (UV) pulses exceeding 105
photons per pulse impinge on a sample surface, a large
number of photoelectrons are created. The emitted elec-
tron cloud in front of the sample has the shape of a
thin disk, hence the electrons strongly interact with each
other. This results in the fact that fast electrons are
pushed ahead and slow electrons are retarded, produc-
ing an energy-shifted and momentum-distorted photoe-
mission spectrum when more than one electron per laser
shot is emitted43,44. The typical strategies to mitigate
space charge eﬀects in photoemission are the reduction

of the photon ﬂux, or the reduction of photon density on
the sample surface by increasing the spot size. However,
these workarounds are far from optimal, as they lead to
a reduction of the statistics of the measurement. This is
a critical problem when dealing with low repetition rate
pulsed UV or X-ray sources, like the present FEL (up to
a hundred hertz) and the few kHz-range HHG sources.

The high repetition rate operation (up to 200 kHz) of
our setup overcomes these problems. Indeed, high repe-
tition rate operation makes it possible to maintain a high
ﬂux with a moderate intensity of the individual pulses,
mitigating space charge.

The laser source used provides constant power (20 W)
above 50 kHz operation. Hence one can reduce the en-
ergy per pulse available for high harmonic generation
by increasing the repetition rate. However, due to the
high nonlinearity of the generation process, the harmonic
beam power is not constant. In addition, also the har-
monics energy cutoﬀ is decreased. This sets an upper
limit to the maximal repetition rate for each harmonics.
In order to demonstrate the possibility to mitigate
space charge eﬀects, we measured the valence band of
a clean surface of a polycrystalline gold foil (Au displays
a ﬂat 6s-like Density of State (DOS) across the Fermi
level, suitable for the estimation of the energy broad-
ening and shift induced by space charge) while tuning
the generation conditions. In particular, we choose three
diﬀerent repetition rates (50 kHz, 100 kHz, 200 kHz),
corresponding to three diﬀerent energies per pulse at 515
nm (200 µJ, 100 µJ, 50 µJ, respectively) after the BBO.

(green curve): a strong reduction of the broadening and
the shift of the Fermi step is achieved.

Panel b shows the spectra measured at 200 kHz upon
further reducing the energy-per-pulse by means of at-
tenuation of the driving laser: some very small space
charge eﬀects are actually still present at maximum ﬂu-
ence (green curve), and the space charge is totally re-
moved when the total electron yield is below 20 pA (blue
and black curves), corresponding to around 600 photo-
electrons per pulse. Panels d) and e) show spectra mea-
sured with the 9th harmonic, where a similar trend can
be observed.

B. Harmonics Energy Bandwidth

Once the space-charge related eﬀects have been con-
trolled, a reliable measurement of the best attainable en-
ergy resolution can be performed by investigating the
Fermi edge of polycrystalline Au at low temperature.

source + △E2

detector + △E2

The Fermi edges measured with the 7th harmonic at
16.9 eV and the 9th harmonic at 21.7 eV at the SPRINT
end-station (analyzer pass energy 5 eV, entrance slit 0.5
mm) are displayed in Fig. 5 panel c) and f), respec-
tively. The ﬁtting curve (blue line) is a convolution of
EK −EF
kB T + 1)−1, with a
the Fermi function f (EK) = (e
Gaussian, accounting for the instrumental resolution, in-
cluding the source photon bandwidth. While the temper-
ature is ﬁxed and known by independent measurement,
the free parameters of the ﬁt are EF and the FWHM
of the Gaussian itself, and the slope and intercept of
the line mimicking the DOS. The resulting FWHM is
22±2 meV at 16.9 eV and 28±2 meV at 21.7 eV. This
value can be decomposed as the sum in quadrature of the
source and the detector contributions 45, as well as other
instrumental broadenings (electronic noise): F W HM 2 =
△E2
other According to the for-
mula △Edetector = (W/2R0)Ep (W = 0.5 mm, R0 =
200 mm, Ep = 5 eV), the expected value of the detec-
tor resolution in the conﬁguration of this measurement is
6.25 meV (to this value one should add the term α2/4Ep
which accounts for the angular spread α of the electrons
transmitted into the hemispheres) 46. We have evaluated
directly the detector resolution by measuring the Fermi
edge at liquid nitrogen temperature with a known source
(He I lamp, 21.22 eV) as a function of the Pass Energy,
yielding △Edetector = (0.0019 ± 0.0006) × EP ; since in
our case Ep = 5 eV, the result is △Edetector = 9.5 ± 3.0
meV, in good agreement with the expected value, con-
sidering the presence of the angular term. Such value is
negligible with respect to the total FHWM retrieved by
the ﬁt in Fig. 5, panel c) and f). Hence, we conclude that
the reported values are the upper limit for the overall en-
ergy resolution measured with the 7th and 9th harmonic.
Most importantly, in Fig. 5, panel b) and e), we report
the overall energy resolution obtained with presence of
space charge, for both the harmonics at 200 kHz. Also in
the worst condition, the overall energy resolution never

FIG. 4. Angle integrated photoemission spectra of polycrys-
talline gold foil at T = 40 K, with 16.9 eV photon energy (7th
HHG harmonic, upper panel) and 21.7 eV photon energy (9th
HHG harmonic, lower panel), changing the energy per pulse
of the driving laser from 110 µJ to 19.9 µJ; for each spectrum
the total electron yield (Isample) is reported as a measure of
the total power impinging on the sample. Spectra are rescaled
so as to have the same height of the Fermi step.

Due to losses from optical components, the energy per
pulse into the generation chambers is 110 µJ, 70 µJ, 29
µJ, respectively. The energy per pulse at ﬁxed repeti-
tion rate can be also changed by an external attenuator
(we report measurements down to 19.9 µJ at 200 kHz).
It allows to analyze the evolution of the photoemission
spectra as a function of the seed energy-per-pulse at a
given repetition rate.

The angle integrated photoemission spectra obtained
with the 7th and the 9th harmonic are displayed in Fig. 4
as a function of the energy per pulse of the driving laser.
The spectra are measured at a temperature T = 40 K.
For each spectrum, the total electron yield is measured by
recording the drain current with a picoammeter (Keith-
ley 6482), which connects the sample to the electrical
ground. As the amount of space charge is reduced, the
spectra shifts towards lower kinetic energy and the Fermi
edge (EF ) becomes steeper. This feature is showed in de-
tail in Fig. 5. Panel a) shows a zoom of the Fermi edge

C. Harmonics Duration

In this section we report on the results obtained by
Angle-Resolved PES (ARPES) at equilibrium and out-of-
equilibrium, using the EUV high-harmonics as a probe.

The experiments have been performed at the T-ReX end-
station equipped with a SPECS Phoibos 225 hemispheri-
cal electron analyzer, using the topological insulator Bis-
muth Selenide (Bi2Se3, provided by HQ Graphene) as a
reference sample. The sample temperature was set to
T=120 K. Fig. 6 shows the ARPES map acquired on the
Bi2Se3 sample in s-polarization, using the 7th harmonics
(hν=16.9 eV) as a probe. The pass-energy of the an-
alyzer was set to 15 eV (the entrance-slit width is 0.5
mm), and the repetition rate of the laser source was 100
kHz. The total acquisition time was ≈10 minutes. The
value of 100 kHz was set for reducing the average pump
power. The intensity of the EUV harmonics can be set
to avoid space charge eﬀect by reducing the intensity of
the laser pulse before the generation. Under these condi-
tions, space-charge is minimized, and a good count rate
is achieved, as it is appreciated from the quality of the
ARPES map. The out-of-equilibrium experiment was
performed under the same experimental conditions, the
only diﬀerence being the analyzer slit width, set to 2 mm
to reduce the acquisition time. As a pump, we used the
fundamental of the laser source, at 1030 nm. The beam
was focused on the sample through a f=1.5 m focal length
lens, down to a spot size of 300±10 µm. The pump-probe
spatial overlap was set by superimposing the two beams
on a Ce:YAG scintillator, that converts EUV radiation in
visible photons (at ≈560 nm) that are imaged by a com-
plementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera.
In the experiment, the pump ﬂuence was set to 150±30
µJ/cm2. The results of the pump-probe experiment are
reported in Fig. 7. In the pump-probe scan, the step of
the delay-line was set to 66.67 fs, which is below the ex-
pected time resolution. The integration time for data
reported in Fig. 7 is 2 hours. The inset of Fig. 7 shows
the diﬀerential ARPES map computed by subtracting
a map acquired before excitation (t=-500 fs) from the
map acquired at t=+300 fs.
In this way, the eﬀect of
the pump excitation is evident. The trace reported in
Fig. 7 shows the electron dynamics extracted by averag-
ing the ARPES intensity in the green box overlaid to the
ARPES map reported as inset. The electron dynamics
has been analyzed with a single exponential decay con-
voluted to a Gaussian (reported in Fig. 7 as a solid blue
line) representing the pump-probe cross correlation. The
only free parameters of the ﬁt (solid black line) are the
intensity I and time-constant τ of the exponential decay,
and the Gaussian FWHM, σ. We obtain τ = 2 ± 0.1 ps
and σ = 300 ± 30 fs.

The duration of the pump-pulse has been mea-
sured independently with an auto-correlator (APE Berlin
PulseCheck) in the last portion of the pump beam path,
and resulted σpump = 280 ± 5 fs. With this value, we
determine an upper limit for the XUV probe FWHM,
after deconvolution of σpump from σ. The result is:
σprobe = 105 ± 45 fs, which is reasonable if we consider
the natural pulse shortening obtained both in the SHG
process (the FWHM of the 515 nm seed beam is 230 ± 5
fs, as measured with the auto-correlator) and in the sub-

8

sequent HHG process. The value we provide constitutes
an upper limit for the harmonics duration, since a non-
negligible rise-time in the TR-ARPES signal measured
on Bi2Se3 is likely present. For Gaussian pulses the min-
imum bandwidth required to sustain a pulse-duration of
105 fs is ≈17 meV. By comparing this value with the
upper limit of the energy bandwidth as determined by
photoemission measurements, we can conclude that we
are close to the transform-limit condition.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work we have addressed one of the major is-
sues in TR-ARPES and TR-PES by mitigating the space
charge eﬀects convoyed by the photoelectric process in
solids. These eﬀects, chieﬂy severe in time resolved pho-
toelectric experiments, signiﬁcantly deplete the overall
energy and momentum resolution.

Here we demonstrate that by controlling the photon
beam parameters, the photon ﬂuence on the sample and
the pulse repetition rate it is possible to perform space-
charge free photoemission with ultrashort EUV photon
pulses.

For the momentum integrated Fermi edge of polycrys-
talline Au at 40 K we achieved an ultimate overall en-
ergy resolution of ∼22 meV. This resolution, close to
the HHG pulse bandwidth, i.e.∼19 meV, when compared
with a photon pulse duration of ∼105 fs, demonstrates
that time resolved PES experiments can be performed
under Fourier transform limit conditions.

As a direct consequence, the HHG source, the pho-
ton beam optics and the photon transport system, as
reported in this work, open the way to TR-PES and TR-
ARPES experiments where the optimal trade-oﬀ between
time and energy resolution is achieved, while the full Bril-
louin zone of crystalline solids can be accessed.

I. METHODS

A. HHG beamline

The main application of the system described is the
generation of high-order EUV harmonics in inert gases
(Ar and Ne in particular). The HHG photon beam
is propagated by a diﬀerentially pumped UHV beam-
line shown in ﬁg. 1a) to two experimental end-stations
designed for PES 1,2. These end-stations have comple-
mentary features, while sharing the possibility of in-situ
preparation and treatment of surfaces and the use of
docking stations able to receive, in UHV, samples grown
elsewhere. The ﬁrst section of the beamline is devoted to
harmonics generation, and comprises a monochromator
to select a speciﬁc harmonics and send the monochro-
matic beam to one of the two end-stations. The EUV
beam is ﬁnally focused to a small spot size (<100 µm Full
Width Half Maximun (FWHM)) at the sample position
of the end-stations. The full optical path for pump/probe
spectroscopies is reported in ﬁg. 1g).

B. Harmonic generation

The HHG process is a highly-nonlinear optical eﬀect
emerging when the intensity of the laser light electric ﬁeld
is comparable to the atomic bond strength of a medium,
most often a gas 3. This eﬀect, known since more than
30 years, leads to the simultaneous generation of a num-
ber of odd harmonics of the seed photon energy, with
almost constant intensity over a wide (plateau) energy

region. It is usually described within the so-called three-
step-model: tunnel ionization, free acceleration and re-
combination (recollision) 4.

The generation chamber (i in Fig. 1a)) is shown in de-
tail in Fig. 1b) and e). In order to maintain a good vac-
uum level without overloading the main turbomolecular
pump, a second chamber is installed around the gas noz-
zle, consisting in a sharp glass tip having 70 µm internal
diameter. This chamber is directly connected via an in-
vacuum feedthrough to a 140 m3/h primary pump. The
only apertures of the inner chamber towards the main
chamber are two adjustable holes for the beam entrance
and exit. This solution allows to routinely apply a gas
pressure of several (4-6) bars at the gas nozzle input,
while maintaining a base pressure of ≈ 10−5 mbar in the
main chamber. The gas nozzle is connected to a trans-
lation stage, used to optimize the nozzle position with
respect to the laser beam.

In the standard operating conditions, the HHG process
is seeded by the second harmonics of the laser, at 515 nm.
The frequency duplication of the laser radiation at 1030
nm is obtained with a 2 mm thick Beta Barium Borate
(BBO) nonlinear crystal. The conversion eﬃciency into
515 nm radiation is 50% without beam focusing. The
beam is then focussed on the gas jet with a 10 cm focal
length lens. We estimate the spot-size at the focus to be
10±2 µm. In order to dump the laser radiation used for
generation, a cone-shaped beam stopper is inserted be-
tween the generation chamber and the monochromator.
A hole of 1.5 mm on the vertex of the cone guarantees
the complete transmission of the harmonics, while limit-
ing the seed beam transmission to only ≈1% of the input
power. In this way, a longer lifetime of mirrors and grat-
ings is expected. The beam dump also introduces a high
vacuum impedance, reducing the pressure rise in the fol-
lowing vacuum chambers due to the generation gas.

FIG. 1. a) overview of the two-branch beamline. The three-dimensional drawing of the HHG-beamline is shown. The overall
extension of the vacuum system is ≈2.5 m. From left to right: i) generation chamber; ii) monochromator with exit slits; iii)
photodiode chambers; iv) refocusing chambers; X: T-ReX branch; Y: SPRINT branch; b) detail of the generation chamber: b1,
pumping port; b2 nozzle manipulator; c) the optics in the monochromator chamber are shown. The beam is collimated by a
ﬁrst toroidal mirror (c1) onto a speciﬁc grating, and subsequently refocused onto one of the two exit slits by a second toroidal
mirror (c2 or c3, depending on which branch is in use) with identical focal length. The ﬁve diﬀraction gratings are mounted in
the so called “oﬀ-plane” geometry in order to mitigate temporal broadening of EUV pulses; d) detail of the refocusing chamber:
d1, refocusing mirror; d2, pump mirror, which allows to send an external laser beam, overlapped with the HHG beam at the
sample position, for pump/probe measurements; d3, metallic mirror, which allows to send outside the chamber the pump beam
and the fundamental radiation from laser, for time overlapping; e) generation region, with gas nozzle and the laser entrance
and exit; f) plasma plume from laser focusing on the gas jet.
