ABSTRACT

The high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution of Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) has provided new insights into the understanding of different small-scale processes
occurring at the chromospheric and transition region (TR) heights. We study the dynamics of high-
frequency oscillations of active region (AR 2376) moss as recorded by simultaneous imaging and
spectral data of IRIS. Wavelet transformation, power maps generated from slit-jaw images in the
Si IV 1400 ˚A passband, and sit-and-stare spectroscopic observations of the Si IV 1403 ˚A spectral
line reveal the presence of high-frequency oscillations with ∼1–2 minute periods in the bright
moss regions. The presence of such low periodicities is further conﬁrmed by intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs) as obtained by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. We ﬁnd
evidence of the presence of slow waves and reconnection-like events, and together they cause
the high-frequency oscillations in the bright moss regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the processes responsible for the heating of the upper atmosphere is the central problem
in solar physics. Though highly debated (see reviews, Klimchuk, 2006; Reale, 2010; Parnell and De
Moortel, 2012), two widely accepted mechanisms for converting magnetic energy into thermal energy
are impulsive heating by nano-ﬂares (Parker, 1988) and heating by dissipation of waves (Arregui, 2015).
The heating processes are generally proposed to occur on small spatial and temporal scales, which were
difﬁcult to observe with the typical resolution of the previous instruments. In the very recent past, the
advent of instruments with better temporal resolutions, several evidences of high-frequency oscillations
of sub-minute periodicities have been reported to be present from the chromosphere (Gupta and Tripathi,
2015; Shetye et al., 2016; Jafarzadeh et al., 2017; Ishikawa et al., 2017) up to the corona (Testa et al.,
2013; Morton and McLaughlin, 2013, 2014; Pant et al., 2015; Samanta et al., 2016)) at sub-arcsec spatial
scales. The small-scale quasi-periodic ﬂows resulting from oscillatory magnetic reconnection as well as the
presence of various Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves produce such observed perturbations in imaging
and spectroscopic observables. These periodic/quasi-periodic perturbations/oscillations observed at such

ﬁner scales in space and time can thus be regarded as the manifestations of the reoccurring dynamic heating
processes present at similar spatial (sub-arcsec) and temporal (sub-minute) scales.

Various MHD waves could be present simultaneously along with quasi-periodic ﬂows or their presence
could entirely be non-concurrent. The plausible mechanism/s for their origin might also be directly coupled
in some cases or completely independent in others. For instances, Gupta and Tripathi (2015) detected
short-period variability (30–90 s) within explosive events observed in TR by IRIS (De Pontieu et al.,
2014) and related them to repetitive magnetic reconnection events. On the other hand, Jafarzadeh et al.
(2017) observed high-frequency of periods 30–50 s in Ca II H bright-points in the chromosphere using
the SUNRISE Filter Imager (SuFI; Gandorfer et al., 2011). They found the evidence of both compressible
(sausage mode) and incompressible (kink mode) waves to be present in the magnetic bright-points. Shetye
et al. (2016) reported transverse oscillations and intensity variations (∼ 20–60 s) in chromospheric spicular
structures using the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP; Scharmer et al., 2008) on the Swedish
1-m Solar Telescope. They argued that high-frequency helical kink motions are responsible for transverse
oscillations and compressive sausage modes to result in intensity variations. They further found evidence
of mode coupling between compressive sausage and non-compressive kink modes and speculated the
presence of other spicules and ﬂows possibly acting as the external drivers for the mode-coupling.

Using the total solar eclipse observations of 11 July 2010 (Singh et al., 2011), Samanta et al. (2016)
detected signiﬁcant oscillations with periods ∼6–20 s in coronal structures. They attributed these high-
frequency oscillations as a mixture of different MHD waves and quasi-periodic ﬂows. Using the High-
resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C; Kobayashi et al. (2014)) data, Testa et al. (2013) observed variability on
time-scales of 15–30 s to be present in the moss regions as observed in the upper TR, which they found to
be mostly located at the foot-points of coronal loops. They regarded such oscillations as the signatures
of heating events associated with reconnection occurring in overlying hot coronal loops, i.e., impulsive
nano-ﬂares. More recently, from the Chromospheric Lyα SpectroPolarimeter (CLASP; Kano et al., 2012)
observations, Ishikawa et al. (2017) also reported short temporal variations in the solar chromosphere and
TR emission of an active region with periodicities of ∼10–30 s. They attributed these intensity variations to
waves or jets from the lower layers instead of nano-ﬂares. Morton and McLaughlin (2013, 2014) analysed
the same active region moss observations of Hi-C as by Testa et al. (2013) and observed the presence of
transverse oscillations with periodicities of 50–70 s. Pant et al. (2015) also studied the same region in Hi-C
observations and detected quasi-periodic ﬂows as well as transverse oscillations with short periodicities
(30–60 s) in braided structures of the moss. They indicated coupling between the sources of transverse
oscillations and quasi-periodic ﬂows, i.e., magnetic reconnection, such that they could be possibly driving
each other.

In the present work, we concentrate on the high-frequency (∼1–2 minute) dynamics of active region (AR
2376) moss as observed by IRIS. IRIS have provided an unprecedented view of the solar chromosphere and
transition region with high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution. The joint imaging and spectroscopic
observations of IRIS at high cadence provide us with a unique opportunity to have a detailed analysis of
different characteristics and mechanisms involved in the generation of high-frequency oscillations in TR
moss regions.

outlined in the image taken in the 171 ˚A pass-band of AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly; Lemen et al.,
2012) and slit-jaw image (SJI) in 1400 ˚A at a particular instance observed by the IRIS. The bottom panel
shows a typical light-curve at a particular location A (marked in the full FOV above) in the moss region in
SJ 1400 ˚A intensity. The nature of the variation of intensity clearly reveals the presence of small amplitude
quasi-periodic variations along with comparatively larger amplitude variations.

Centred at 146(cid:48)(cid:48), 207(cid:48)(cid:48), the imaging data (slit-jaw images or SJIs) have a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of
119(cid:48)(cid:48) × 119(cid:48)(cid:48). The SJIs are taken with a cadence of 13 seconds and have spatial resolution ≈ 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48).
The simultaneous large sit-and stare spectroscopic data has a cadence of 3.3 seconds with the slit-width of
0.35(cid:48)(cid:48) and pixel size along the solar-Y axis to be 0.1664(cid:48)(cid:48) with slit length of 119(cid:48)(cid:48). Every observation in
this data-set has an exposure time of 2 seconds. The high cadence of these data-sets provides us a unique
opportunity to investigate the high-frequency dynamics in this region with high signiﬁcance level.

We use IRIS SJIs centred at the Si IV 1400 ˚A passband which samples emission from the transition region
(TR). For spectral analysis, we concentrate on the Si IV (1403 ˚A) line formed at log10 T ≈ 4.9K which
is one of the prominent TR emission lines observed with the IRIS and is free from other line blends. For
density diagnostics, we use the O IV (1401 ˚A) TR line along with Si IV (1403 ˚A) (Keenan et al., 2002;
Young et al., 2018). The calibrated level 2 data of IRIS is used in the study. Dark current subtraction,
ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, and geometrical correction have been taken into account in the level 2 data. We employ
wavelet analysis (Torrence and Compo, 1998) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD; Huang et al.,

(section 3.1) and different spectral properties i.e., total intensity, peak intensity, Doppler velocity, and
Doppler width (sections 3.2).

3 DATA-ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1 Imaging Analysis from Si IV 1400 ˚A SJIs

Wavelet analysis is performed at each pixel location of SJ FOV to obtain the period of SJ intensity
variability over the observed moss region. As shown in Figure 1, a typical light curve corresponding to a
single pixel location for the entire duration reveals presence of quasi-periodic small and large amplitude
intensity ﬂuctuations. Figure 2 (a) shows a representative example (selected at random) of wavelet analysis
results corresponding to the pixel location marked as A in SJ FOV (Figure 1) for a duration of 20 minutes. It
should be noted that in most of results we show the wavelet and EMD analysis corresponding to 20 minutes
interval only so that the temporal variations in intensity can be studied more carefully, particularly as we
are interested in the shorter periodicities. The top panel in Figure 2 (a) shows the variation of SJ intensity
with time. The middle-panel shows the background (trend) subtracted intensity which is further used to
obtain wavelet power spectrum (lower panels). The background (trend) is obtained by taking the 10-point
running average of the intensity variation. The bottom left panel displays a wavelet power spectrum (color
inverted) with 99% signiﬁcance levels and the bottom right panel displays a global wavelet power spectrum
(wavelet power spectrum summed over time) with 99% global signiﬁcance.

The power spectra obtained reveals the presence of short-period variability in the SJ intensity light-curve,
with a distinct power peak at a period of 1.6 min. It is important to note that even without considering the
background trend, we obtain a power peak at the same period in wavelet spectra but with low signiﬁcance
level. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is also employed at a few locations in the SJ FOV. Figure 2 (b)

shows the different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) obtained from EMD for the same SJ light-curve as
shown in Figure 2 (a). Here only the ﬁrst four IMFs are shown as the further IMFs contain the larger
background trends. The dominant period (P) mentioned in the ﬁgure for each IMF is calculated using fast-
Fourier transform (FFT). The period of the ﬁrst four IMFs for the particular example shown in Figure 2 (b)
are 0.74 min, 1.25 min, 2.85 min and 3.99 min. The EMD analysis reinforces the detection of the presence
of short periodicities (1–2 min) in the moss region as obtained by wavelet analysis. The presence of
periodicities < 1 min can also be noted from the Figure 2, though these are below the signiﬁcance level of
99% as shown in wavelet power spectra. Such oscillations have very small amplitudes, are present even for
shorter-duration and could be damping fast. Hence, the oscillations with periods < 1 min may carry smaller
amount of energy and may not be so important as those with periods > 1 min which may be distributed
over larger spatial and temporal extents.

To focus on the distribution of power as calculated from the wavelet method, we obtain the power maps
of SJ intensity over the full FOV in 1–2 min and 2–4 min period intervals (Figure 3) by considering the
entire duration of the observation. The entire duration of the observations is chosen to understand the global
dynamics of the active region moss. On comparison of power maps with the SJ images (Figure 3) and
AIA images (Figure 1), it can be observed that the signiﬁcant power of high-frequency (1–2 min) as well
as low-frequency (2–4 min) oscillations is generally present only in bright regions of the moss. Figure 3
also shows the time-average SJI with the power contours of of 1–2 min variability in red and 2–4 min in
yellow. The power contours enclose the locations with the value of signiﬁcant power to be more than 100,
in respective period range. The ﬁner and smaller spatial extents of the contours at various locations over the
ﬁeld of view suggest that these oscillations possess high power in the localized regions within the bright
moss. Moreover, the comparison of power between short (1–2 min) and long (2–4 min) periodicities, as
showcased in Figure 3, reveals that the power in 1–2 min variability is, in general, less than that in 2–4 min.

3.2 Spectral Analysis from Si IV 1403 ˚A emission line

To characterize periodicities present in the spectrograph data, we produce power maps of the spectral
parameters obtained by ﬁtting a single Gaussian to the Si IV 1403 ˚A emission spectra using wavelet analysis.
The analysis was performed over the entire duration of the observations. At few instances, we interpolate
the spectral parameters where a Gaussian ﬁtting could not be performed due to poor signal to noise. The
power maps clearly showcase the signiﬁcant power along the slit, predominantly present in the period
range of 0.83 to 2.36 min corresponding to pixel locations of the bright moss regions (wherever the slit

crosses the bright moss). This conﬁrms the presence of short-period oscillations in Si IV 1403 ˚A spectra
along with the Si IV 1400 ˚A SJ intensity (described in Section 3.1) in various locations of the moss region.

Now we shift our focus to shorter time intervals where data gaps due to poor signal-to-noise are absent.
This allow us to investigate the correlation between different spectral parameters using wavelet and EMD
analysis. Further, taking the intervals of 20 minutes is sufﬁcient because we are primarily interested in
shorter periods like, 1-2 minutes. Figure 5 (a) shows the wavelet maps of total intensity variation for a
duration of 20 minutes at a particular location along the slit (marked as B in the SJ FOV in Figure 1). Total
intensity signiﬁes the summed intensity over the wavelength range. Figure 6 (a) shows the wavelet maps of
Doppler velocity at the same location B and same time-interval as shown for total intensity in Figure 5.
Note that the location B is very close to location A so that a comparison can be made with the periodicities
found at location A using SJI. Moreover, the same time-interval is shown in Figures 2, 5 and 6 for better
illustration. Figure 7 shows the variation of peak intensity, Doppler width, total intensity and Doppler
velocity of Si IV 1403 ˚A line at location B along with the spectral line-proﬁle at a particular instance. The
observational uncertainties are shown in the left panel over the observed line-proﬁle. These errors are
taken into account while ﬁtting the Gaussian proﬁle (green solid curve). The ﬁtting errors of the respective
spectral parameters are shown in the adjacent light curves in orange. It can be clearly observed that the
errors in the spectral parameters are much less than the amplitude of oscillations. For instance, the average
magnitude of error over the Doppler velocity light curve shown in Figure 6 and 7 is 0.5 km/s, whereas the
amplitude of oscillation of its IMFs (as shown in Figure 6) is more than 1 km/s in most of the cases. The
oscillations in the spectral parameters are well above the error values in general and thus signiﬁcant. An
animation of the Figure 7 is available in the online version which shows the evolution of the spectral line
proﬁle with time.

The background trends for the spectral parameter light curves (in Figure 5 and 6) are obtained by
considering the 35-point running average of the light-curves. The dominant power peaks are observed to be
present 1.5 min for total intensity, 1.7 min for peak intensity, 1.7 min for Doppler velocity, and 1.5 min for
Doppler width in the respective power spectra. Here again, the presence of periodicities of < 1 min can be

seen in the wavelet. It can be clearly observed that such oscillations are present for very short durations and
thus of not much signiﬁcance over the longer durations. Also, such short periodicities could be due to the
presence of noise which is picked up by wavelet at higher-frequencies.

The EMD technique is applied over the spectral variations in order to segregate the different periodicities
present in their light curves. Figure 5 (b) and 6 (b) respectively shows the ﬁrst four IMFs and their periods
(P) of total intensity and Doppler velocity variation for the duration of 20 minutes at the location B. The
ﬁrst four IMFs (IMF0, IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3) are observed to contain the short-period variabilities
(0.2–2 min). The successive IMFs are observed to have periodicities of more than 2 min and hence not
discussed in the present analysis. To perform a statistical study of correlation and phase-relationship
between Doppler velocity and total intensity, we study 40 different light-curves (cases), each of duration
20 minutes. These cases are selected to be located in the close neighbourhood of the power contours of

1–2 min periodicities (red contours in the average SJ image in Figure 3). The locations of the selected cases
are marked in black along the slit in the SJ image in Figure 3. Few speciﬁc time-intervals are considered at
these locations in order to have further study about phase-relationship between Doppler velocity and total
intensity.

Figure 8. Histograms showing the distribution of periods of the ﬁrst four IMFs of total intensity in red
and Doppler velocity in blue for the 40 selected cases.

Figure 8 shows the histograms of the period of oscillations for different IMFs of total intensity and Doppler
velocity with the mean periods listed in the ﬁgure. As reﬂected by the value of mean periods, we will
further regard the IMF0 to be associated with the periodicity of ∼0.17 min, IMF1 with ∼0.40 min, IMF2
with ∼0.72 min and IMF3 with ∼1.26 min. The power maps in Figure 4 shows the absence of signiﬁcant
power in the periods below 0.6 min. Henceforth, for the further analysis about phase-relationship, we
consider only the third and fourth IMFs, i.e., IMF2 and IMF3. The phase-relation between Doppler velocity
and total intensity at the short-periodicities is studied by correlating their respective IMFs for the 40 cases.
Figure 9 shows the histograms of the phase difference between Doppler velocity and total intensity by
considering IMF2 and IMF3. The sign convention for the values of phase-shifts considered here is such that
the positive values phase-shift signiﬁes the Doppler velocity to be leading with respect to the total intensity.
The histogram of IMF2 reveal the presence of preferred phase-shifts at ∼ ±3T /8 (∼ ±3π/4) where
T=0.72 min, is the time period of oscillation. The histogram of IMF3 shows the dominant phase-shifts at
∼ −T /2 (∼ −π) where T=1.26 min.

Figure 9. Histograms showing the distribution of phase-difference between total intensity and Doppler
velocity for IMF2 and IMF3 for the 40 selected cases.

The presence of a dominant phase shift of ∼T/2 for periodicities of ∼1.26 min (IMF3) indicates the
presence of reconnection events. As shown in Figure 7, the increase in the intensity is accompanied by the
increase in the Doppler width and decrease in Doppler velocity (blue-shifted ﬂows, De Pontieu et al., 2009;
De Pontieu and McIntosh, 2010) at many instances throughout the light-curve. Few of such instances are
shown by vertical dotted lines in Figure 7. In case of phase-shifts of ∼±T/2 or ∼±π, the reconnection
process results in near simultaneous variation in the spectral parameters with the resultant mass ﬂow
projected towards the line-of-sight (blue-shifts or negative Doppler velocity). As the TR emission lines
are red-shifted in general, the ﬂows towards the line-of-sight (blue-shifted ﬂows) will appear to decrease
the Doppler speeds simultaneously with the increase in the intensity and width (phase shifts of ∼±T/2
or ∼±π). On the other hand, the ﬂows away from the line-of-sight will increase the value of the Doppler
speeds with an increase in the line intensity and width (∼ zero phase-shift). It can be observed from
Figure 7 and also indicated by Figure 9 that the red-shifted ﬂows (cases with zero phase difference) occur
less frequently compared to blue-shifted ﬂows (cases with phase shifts of ±T/2). As shown in Figure 7, the
instances of large amplitude ﬂuctuations, which mostly have phase shift of ∼T/2 between Doppler velocity
and total intensity, can be regarded as the clear signatures of quasi-periodic outﬂows (towards the observer)
resulting from the reconnection process. The other instances of small amplitude ﬂuctuations can be due the
presence of slow magneto-acoustic waves.

Very recently, Hansteen et al. (2014) and Brooks et al. (2016) have reported the presence of transition
region ﬁne loops with the aid of IRIS observations and numerical simulations. Such small scale loops
with loop lengths of ∼1 to 2 Mm can harbour slow standing waves with periods of ∼1 min in transition
region. It is worth noting at this point that Wang et al. (2003); Taroyan et al. (2007); Taroyan and Bradshaw
(2008) reported the presence of standing slow waves exclusively in hot coronal loops. In addition, Pant et al.
(2017) reported the existence of standing slow waves in cool coronal loops (∼0.6 MK). In this work, we
found evidence of the existence of slow waves in Si IV 1403 ˚A emission line whose formation temperature
is ∼60000 K. In an ideal case, the phase-shift of ∼±T/4 is attributed to the presence of standing slow
waves in the solar atmosphere (Wang et al., 2003; Taroyan et al., 2007; Taroyan and Bradshaw, 2008;
Moreels and Van Doorsselaere, 2013). Further, it should be noted that the intensity and velocity changes
phase in time due to the heating and cooling of the plasma (Taroyan and Bradshaw, 2008) and due to

presence of imperfect waveguides and drivers in reality, which deviates from the theoretical considerations
(Keys et al., 2018). Thus the phase shift between intensity and velocity oscillations might differ in different
regions and different time as showcased in Figure 10. Figure 10 shows the representative examples of the
IMFs (IMF2 and IMF3) at the location B along the slit. The phase-shift between Doppler velocity and
total intensity (φ) obtained using the correlation techniques is also mentioned in the respective panels. The
comparison between of the respective IMFs of intensity and Doppler velocity ﬂuctuations clearly depicts
that the phase-shift between them changes continuously throughout the entire duration. This could be
due to the intermittent nature of the ﬂows and waves that might result in departure from the theoretically
expected values of the phase-shifts. Hence we conjecture that the statistically dominant phase shift of
∼±3T/8 for periodicities of ∼0.72 min (IMF2) is due to the presence of small-scale ﬂows along with slow
standing waves in TR ﬁne loops. This supports both wave and reconnection like scenario to be responsible
for the periodicities of 1-2 min in moss regions, which is discussed in details in section 4.

3.3 Density diagnostics from Si IV 1403 ˚A and O IV 1401 ˚A emission lines

In order to obtain the information about density variations associated with the presence of waves
and/or reconnection ﬂows, in the moss regions, we attempt to estimate density along the slit using
Si IV 1403 ˚A (λ = 1402.77 ˚A) and O IV 1401 ˚A (λ = 1401.16 ˚A) spectral lines from the IRIS spectra (as
suggested by Young et al., 2018). They introduced an empirical correction factor to normalize Si IV/O IV
line intensity ratios. As ﬁrst mentioned by Dupree (1972), the observed intensities of lines from the lithium
and sodium-like iso-electronic sequences are usually stronger than that expected by the emission measures
from other sequences formed at the same temperature. Hence, such a correction factor is important to be
applied to silicon line intensities. Table 2 of Young et al. (2018) gives the theoretical ratios of different
lines after employing the correction factor (see QS DEM method as explained in Young et al., 2018; Young,
2018). We use the Si IV (1402.77)/O IV (1401.16) line ratio from Table 2 of Young et al. (2018) for the
estimation of electron density at a temperature of log T /K = 4.88 (temperature of maximum ionization of
Si IV).

High-frequency dynamics of moss

As the O IV 1401 ˚A line is very weak in IRIS spectra, the spectra is averaged over 7 pixels along the slit.
In such averaging, for instance, the data value of the ﬁrst 7 spatial pixels are replaced by their average
value, the next 7 pixels are replaced by their respective average data-value, and so on. Similarly, time-
averaging is also performed by considering 4 time steps along the temporal axis. In order to improve S/N,
such averaging is performed only over O IV 1401 ˚A spectra as Si IV 1403 ˚A spectra contains signiﬁcantly
good signal. Figure 11 (a) and (b) shows the time-sequence maps of peak intensity along the slit for the
Si IV 1403 ˚A and O IV 1401 ˚A line-proﬁles. A comparison between the two maps clearly shows that despite
averaging the spectra (as explained above), we are able to obtain good S/N only for very few isolated
O IV 1401 ˚A line-proﬁles in order to perform a reliable Gaussian ﬁt, hence the peak intensity values for the
O IV 1401 ˚A line are shown only for those isolated few pixels.

solid black and the estimated density values are over-plotted in magenta. The density time-sequence map is
also showcased in Figure 11(d). Note that we could estimate the density only at very few instances of some
of the locations, as limited by the poor signal in O IV 1401 ˚A spectra. It can be observed in Figure 11(d) that
we cannot ﬁnd considerable examples of continuous density signal along time for some signiﬁcant amount
of duration over the entire observation. It is completely unreliable to perform any time series analysis over
such light-curves. It appears that there are deﬁnite changes in the density but to relate those changes with
intensity and other line parameters for identiﬁcation of the wave mode is beyond the quality of the current
observations. Thus, we are still unable to obtain any results related to density oscillations with the present
data.

High-frequency dynamics of moss

4 CONCLUSIONS

In the present article, we study high-frequency dynamics of active region moss by using high spatially and
spectrally resolved observations of IRIS, with the fast cadence of 13 seconds for imaging and 3.3 seconds
for spectral data. The techniques of wavelet and EMD analysis are employed in conjunction to explore the
characteristics of the high-frequency oscillations. We have observed the persistent presence of periodicities
in the 1–2 min range in the Si IV 1400 ˚A SJ intensity as well as in different spectral parameters (total
intensity, peak intensity, Doppler velocity, and Doppler width) derived from the Si IV 1403 ˚A emission
line. The power maps deduced from the SJ intensity variations show the concentration of power in short-
periodicities generally in the bright regions of the moss. This result is in agreement with the study of
Pant et al. (2015), where the authors reported high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations concentrated over
localised regions in the active region moss. However, no attempts were made to understand the nature of
variability due to the lack of spectral data. That study was performed using the 193 ˚A passband of Hi-C
which is sensitive to coronal temperatures. In this work, we ﬁnd similar signatures in TR. Additionally, the
power maps of the spectral parameters also reveal the predominance of signiﬁcant power in the 1–2 min
period range.

We study the phase difference between Doppler velocities and total intensity. Our study supports both
wave and reconnection like scenario to be responsible for the periodicities of 1-2 min in moss regions.
Studying the phase relationships, we can conclude that the periodicity of 1.26 min with dominant phase
shifts of ∼ −T /2 (∼ −π) is predominantly due to the outﬂows resulting from the reconnection process.
On the other hand, the periodicity of 0.72 min with dominant phase shifts of ∼ ±3T /8 (∼ ±3π/4) can
be regarded as the collective signatures of the small-scale ﬂows and slow standing modes existing within
the transition region ﬁne loops of lengths 1 to 2 Mm. Hence qualitatively, we can conjecture that the high-
frequency oscillations of ∼1 min, observed in the bright moss regions are possibly due to the combination
of slow magneto-acoustic waves and reconnection events. As explained in section 3.3, we cannot obtain
any reliable results from the density variations, although we are able to estimate the average density of
the moss regions but to reliably study the density variation much better quality of data is required. The
high-frequency oscillations in the moss regions can be due to compressive waves. The key to distinguish
between the different modes conclusively is to study the density variations which is not possible with
present data because of low data-counts present in the O IV 1410 ˚A emission line. Some new instruments,
with better sensitivity in the FUV wavelengths, especially in the density sensitive lines, may provide new
insight and will enable us to speciﬁcally detect the particular wave modes responsible for such oscillations.
