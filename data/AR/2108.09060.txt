Abstract

I found that ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 shows large-amplitude (1.2–1.4 mag) nearly sinusoidal vari-
ations with a period of 10.803(2) d and very short period variations with a period of 0.0068 d using Public
Data Release of Zwicky Transient Facility observations. The only known object that shows a similar combina-
tion of nearly sinusoidal reﬂection variations and very short period, large-amplitude variations is the unique
white dwarf pulsar AR Sco. ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 appears to be very similar to AR Sco and
observations at various wavelengths are desired.

ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 is variable object detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Super-
novae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014, Kochanek et al. 2017) and was cataloged as and eclipsing binary (type
EB) with a period of 1.046984 d.1 This object was also independently listed as a candidate RR Lyr star by Sesar
et al. (2017) using the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1, Chambers et al.
2016). It was also independently listed as a variable star ATO J313.9329+24.0092 by Heinze et al. (2018) using
the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS, Tonry et al. 2018) data.

I used Public Data Release 6 of the Zwicky Transient Facility (Masci et al., 2019) observations2 and found
that this object showed large-amplitude (1.2–1.4 mag) nearly sinusoidal variations with a period of 10.803(2) d
and very short period variations during time-resolved runs on two nights in the ZTF data (ﬁgures 1, 2).

The object is very blue as can be seen as the almost zero color index in ﬁgures 1, 2. The large distance
modulus (11.1 mag) based on the Gaia parallax (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2021) indicates that the object is
intrinsically faint. These features suggest that this 10.803-d day variation is caused by reﬂection by the secondary
star in a binary containing a hot component.

The short-term variations are directly visible to the eye in the ZTF time-resolved photometry (ﬁgure 3).
Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM; Stellingwerf 1978) analysis after de-trending the data yielded periods of
0.00675(3) d for the BJD 2458661 run (ﬁgure 4) and 0.00682(2) d for the BJD 2458802 run (ﬁgure 5). The errors
of the periods were determined by the methods of Fernie (1989) and Kato et al. (2010). These periods are fairly
in agreement and I consider that they represent the spin period of the white dwarf.

This combination of the large-amplitude reﬂection variation and the high-amplitude spin pulse is seen
in the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco (Marsh et al. 2016; Stiller et al. 2018). We recently reported that ZTF
J185139.81+171430.3 = ZTF18abnbzvx shows high-amplitude spin variations (Kato and Kojiguchi, 2021) and
suggested it to be a possible white dwarf pulsar, but the large-amplitude reﬂection variation is missing in ZTF
J185139.81+171430.3. The present observations indicate ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 looks more similar to
AR Sco than ZTF J185139.81+171430.3 and observations in various wavelengths to search for the evidence for
non-thermal emissions as in AR Sco.
