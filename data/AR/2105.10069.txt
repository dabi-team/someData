ABSTRACT

Recent observations in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths reveal a new late phase in some solar ﬂares,
which is seen as a second peak in warm coronal emissions (∼ 3 MK) several tens of minutes to a few hours
after the soft X-ray (SXR) peak. The origin of the EUV late phase (ELP) is explained by either a long-lasting
cooling process in the long ELP loops, or a delayed energy ejection into the ELP loops well after the main ﬂare
heating. Using the observations with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we investigate the production of
the ELP in six homologous ﬂares (F1–F6) originating from a complex active region (AR) NOAA 11283, with
an emphasis on the emission characteristics of the ﬂares. It is found that the main production mechanism of the
ELP changes from additional heating in ﬂare F1 to long-lasting cooling in ﬂares F3–F6, with both mechanisms
playing a role in ﬂare F2. The transition is evidenced by an abrupt decrease of the time lag of the ELP peak,
and the long-lasting cooling process in the majority of the ﬂares is validated by a positive correlation between
the ﬂare ribbon ﬂuence and the ELP peak intensity. We attribute the change in ELP production mechanism to
an enhancement of the envelope magnetic ﬁeld above the AR, which facilitates a more prompt and energetic
heating of the ELP loops. In addition, the last and the only conﬁned ﬂare F6 exhibits an extremely large ELP.
The different emission pattern revealed in this ﬂare may reﬂect a different energy partitioning inside the ELP
loops, which is due to a different magnetic reconnection process.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares, manifested as transient enhancements of electromagnetic radiation over a wide wavelength range, are one of the
most energetic phenomena in the solar atmosphere. The energy capable of driving a solar ﬂare comes from the coronal magnetic
ﬁelds. Through the magnetic reconnection process (Parker 1963), the non-potential magnetic energy stored in the corona is
rapidly converted into plasma heating, particle acceleration, and in case of an eruptive event, large-scale mass motion that is
usually known as a coronal mass ejection (CME, e.g., Priest & Forbes 2002; Fletcher et al. 2011).

According to the standard two-ribbon solar ﬂare model (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman
1976, conventionally termed the CSHKP model), energy release during the ongoing magnetic reconnection instantly heats up the
newly reconnected post-ﬂare loops (ﬂare loops for short), whose evolution can be divided into two phases as typically seen in
soft X-ray (SXR) emissions: an impulsive rise, followed by a more gradual decay toward the background level. The two phases
reﬂect a dynamic heating-cooling cycle of the ﬂare loops. The impulsive phase coincides with the impulsive heating and a follow-
up evaporation of hot material driven by thermal conduction and/or non-thermal electron bombardment (Antiochos & Sturrock
1978), and the gradual phase corresponds to a radiative-dominated cooling together with enthalpy draining during the later stage
(Antiochos 1980; Bradshaw & Cargill 2010).

Emission from the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) domain provides another important tool to diagnose the ﬂare evolution. In the
CSHKP model, the EUV coronal emissions of a solar ﬂare resemble the tendency seen in SXR, with the emission peaks in dif-
ferent lines/passbands occurring sequentially in an order of decreasing temperatures, coincident with the cooling of the ﬂaring
plasma (Chamberlin et al. 2012). Nevertheless, by using full-disk integrated EUV irradiance observations with the EUV Variabil-

ity Experiment (EVE; Woods et al. 2012) on board the recently launched Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012)
mission, Woods et al. (2011) discovered a new “EUV late phase (ELP)” in some solar ﬂares, which is predominately seen as a
second peak in the warm coronal emissions (e.g., Fe XVI 335 ˚A, ∼3 MK) several tens of minutes to a few hours after the GOES
SXR peak. Furthermore, spatially resolved observations as taken with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) also on board SDO reveal that the ELP emission originates from a set of higher and longer ﬂare loops rather than the main
ﬂare loops, even though the two groups of loops are magnetically related within the same active region (AR).

In a preliminary statistical study, Woods et al. (2011) found that ELP ﬂares are not so common among all solar ﬂares, and
they tend to occur from some speciﬁc ARs. This has been later validated by many case studies that reveal a multipolar mag-
netic conﬁguration of the ﬂare-hosting ARs: they exhibit either a quadrupolar conﬁguration (Hock et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013;
Wang et al. 2020), or a parasitic polarity embedded in a large-scale bipolar magnetic ﬁeld (Dai et al. 2013, 2018; Sun et al. 2013;
Masson et al. 2017). In particular, the latter conﬁguration facilitates the formation of a circular-shaped ﬂare ribbon together
with a remote ribbon, which implies a three-dimensional (3D) fan-spine topology as conﬁrmed by force-free ﬁeld extrapolations
(Sun et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Masson et al. 2017), with the ﬁeld lines in distinct lengths tracing different sets
of ﬂare loops.

Upon discovery, the ELP was at ﬁrst attributed to an additional heating in the ELP loops that takes place well after the heating
of main ﬂare loops (Woods et al. 2011; Hock et al. 2012; Dai et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2019). This delayed heating should be much
weaker compared to the main ﬂare heating, therefore mainly enhancing the emissions at intermediate temperatures. Based on
the fact that the ELP loops are signiﬁcantly longer than the main ﬂare loops, an alternative scenario was proposed that both sets
of ﬂare loops are heated simultaneously during the main phase, but the ELP loops experience a much more extended cooling
process (Liu et al. 2013; Masson et al. 2017; Dai et al. 2018). The difference in cooling time scale between the loops of different
lengths can naturally explain the separation of an ELP peak from the main phase peak (Cargill et al. 1995; Chen et al. 2020). It
was also pointed out that the two mechanisms may both play a role in an ELP ﬂare (Sun et al. 2013).

Using the zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic model enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops (EBTEL; Klimchuk et al.
2008; Cargill et al. 2012; Barnes et al. 2016), Dai & Ding (2018) have recently numerically probed the production of ELP ﬂares.
It was found that under the above two mechanisms, the ELP loops may experience different cooling stages around the ELP peak:
radiative cooling stage for the long-lasting cooling scenario while conductive cooling stage for the additional heating scenario.
This difference in loop thermodynamic evolution will cause opposite patterns in the shape of the synthetic ﬂare light curves,
which can be in turn used as a new diagnostic tool to differentiate the two mechanisms from real solar observations.

The origin of ELP in solar ﬂares is still not fully understood. Since the occurrence of ELP ﬂares shows a tendency to be
in clusters from the same AR, a comparative analysis of homologous ELP ﬂares under the similar magnetic environment will
certainly shed new light on this issue. In this paper, we focus on such ﬂares from a complex AR, with an emphasis on the emission
characteristics of the ELP in these ﬂares. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief introduction
to the instruments and data used in this study. Detailed analysis of the observational data is carried out in Section 3. The results
are discussed and main conclusions are drawn in Section 4.

2. INSTRUMENTS AND DATASET

The data used in this work are primarily from the instruments on board SDO. EVE measures full-disk integrated solar irradiance
over a wavelength range between 1 ˚A and 1050 ˚A with 1 ˚A spectral resolution and 10 s cadence. As a subset of EVE data products,
the irradiance of some “isolated” lines is derived by integrating the EVE spectra over speciﬁed spectral windows. AIA provides
simultaneous imaging observations of the solar corona and transition region (TR) in 10 EUV/UV passbands with a pixel size of
0.6′′ and a temporal resolution of 12 s or 24 s. In addition, magnetograms obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) help us check the magnetic conﬁguration of the ﬂare-hosting AR.

We focus on a complex AR NOAA 11283 that was recorded passing through the visible disk from 2011 August 31 to September
11. The AR harbored a series of major ﬂares, which have been extensively studied in the literature (e.g., Feng et al. 2013;
Jiang et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2014; Romano et al. 2015; Ruan et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). In particular, some of
the ﬂares also exhibited a notable ELP (see Dai et al. 2013, 2018).

For event selection, we apply two following criteria. First, we choose ﬂare events above the M class to ensure that the ﬂares
are energetic enough to power a potential ELP. As reported in previous studies, an ELP can be observed in ﬂares as weak as the
C2 level (Woods et al. 2011). However, after carefully checking all ﬂares in AR 11283, we did ﬁnd that none of the ﬂares below
our selection threshold produced a detectable ELP. Second, the ﬂares should be located within a heliocentric distance of 60◦ from
the disk center so that the identiﬁcation of ﬂaring structures is less affected by the effects of foreshortening and/or line-of-sight
(LOS) overlapping. As revealed by the GOES 1–8 ˚A SXR time proﬁle shown in Figure 1, there were a total of 7 M/X-class ﬂares

(labeled as F1 to F7) originating from AR 11283. Among these 7 candidate events, the last one (F7 on September 10) was quite
close to the western limb (N12W61), hence being removed from our ﬁnal dataset.

Some general information on the selected ﬂares and their associated phenomena are listed in Table 1. As seen in the table, and
also revealed in Figure 1, the magnitude of the major ﬂares from AR 11283, with the exception of ﬂare F1, shows a tendency of
decrease with time, which may reﬂect a general decay of the AR energetics with the ﬂare energy release. With the aid of other
data sources such as those from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) , it is found that all ﬂares except for the last one (ﬂare F6) are associated with a
CME, implying eruptive events. Among the ﬁve eruptive ﬂares, all but one (ﬂare F4) are accompanied by a metric type II radio
burst, meaning that most of the CMEs are fast enough to drive a coronal shock.

3. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS

3.1. Overview of the AR and Flares

Figures 2(a)–(c) and (g)–(i) show the HMI LOS magnetograms of AR 11283. Upon appearance, the AR was largely a bipolar
one, with two main polarities labeled as P1 (for positive) and N (for negative), respectively. Under such simple magnetic conﬁg-
uration, the ﬂare level of the AR was quite low during the early stage. From September 4 to 5, a persistent emergence of opposite
magnetic ﬂux took place inside the leading polarity N, ﬁnally evolving into a new parasitic polarity P2 surrounded by polarity N.
This ﬂux emergence signiﬁcantly complicated the magnetic conﬁguration of the AR, leading to the occurrence of the consequent
major ﬂares studied in this work.

As seen from the AIA 1600 ˚A chromospheric images in Figures 2(d)–(f) and (j)–(l), under the similar multipolar magnetic
conﬁguration, the ﬂares also exhibit similar multiple ribbon morphology. The ﬂare ribbons are predominately manifested as a
circular ribbon in the western negative polarity N (labeled as Rc) and an elongated ribbon in the eastern positive polarity P1
(labeled as Rr). The two ﬂare ribbons brighten up and reach the peak nearly simultaneously (typically within 1 minute, see Table
2). At ﬁrst glance, they seem to constitute a pair of conjugate ribbons as typically seen in a two-ribbon ﬂare. Nevertheless, a third
rather compact ribbon can be identiﬁed in the parasitic polarity P2, which is much closer to and roughly parallel with the circular
ribbon Rc. Affected by saturation of the instrument detectors in strongly ﬂaring regions, this ribbon is less distinguishable from
ribbon Rc. As we will see below, all the ﬂares are driven by the eruption of a sigmoid ﬁlament initially lying along the polarity
inversion line (PIL) between polarities P2 and N (hereafter PIL-P2N). In this sense, these two adjacent ribbons should belong
to main ﬂare ribbons, while the eastern ﬂare ribbon Rr is more likely to correspond to a remote ribbon. Because of the general
similarity between the ﬂares, we call them homologous ﬂares.

Figure 3 displays the background-subtracted irradiance of the ﬂares in three EVE lines, including the Fe XX 133 ˚A (∼10 MK),
Fe XVI 335 ˚A (∼3 MK), and Fe IX 171 ˚A (∼0.8 MK), which cover emissions from the hot, warm, and cool corona, respectively.
In each ﬂare, the hot coronal Fe XX 133 ˚A emission closely resembles the GOES SXR light curve due to their similar temperature
response. For the eruptive ﬂares (F1–F5), the cool coronal Fe IX 171 ˚A emission quickly turns into a dimming after the main
phase peak, which may reﬂect a mass drainage during the CME lift-off (e.g., Aschwanden et al. 2009; Cheng & Qiu 2016). Of
particular interest is another enhancement of the warm coronal Fe XVI 335 ˚A emission well after the main phase peak, indicative
of a potential ELP according to Woods et al. (2011). The emission pattern of the ELP seen in EVE 335 ˚A is quite different in
different ﬂares. In ﬂares F1 and F2, the ELP shows an extended decay. In ﬂare F3, the ELP has a plateau-like shape followed by
a relatively fast drop. In ﬂares F4 and F5, the EVE 335 ˚A irradiance after the main phase peak seems to fall back to an elevated
“background”, from which the identiﬁcation of a possible ELP needs to further resort to spatially resolved observations with
AIA. For the only non-eruptive ﬂare F6, it exhibits an extremely large ELP, with peak emission over 1.3 times that of the main
phase peak.

3.2. Spatially Resolved Observations of Individual Flares
3.2.1. The September 6 X2.1 Flare

Rather than following the exact chronological order of ﬂare onset, we start our analysis with ﬂare F2 (September 06 X2.1),
an event having been investigated in our previous work (Dai et al. 2013), whose general evolution has also been reproduced by
Jiang et al. (2018) using a data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulation. Here we extend our previous study
and revisit the origin of the ELP in this ﬂare, which will serve as a basis for the analysis of other events.

The left panels of Figure 4 show characteristic snapshots of the ﬂare evolution in the AIA passbands of 131, 335, and 171 ˚A,
respectively, the choice of which is based on a general temperature correspondence to the three EVE lines shown in Figure 3.
The ﬂare begins with the eruption of an east–west (EW) oriented ﬁlament from the southern part of PIL-P2N around 22:18 UT
(top row in Figure 4). As pointed out by the arrow in Figure 4(e), the ﬁlament exhibits a forward “S” shape, indicative of a

magnetic ﬂux rope (FR) of the sinistral chirality (Chen et al. 2014), which is properly reconstructed lying under the dome of
a fan-spine magnetic structure in non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolations (Feng et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2014). We
note that this northern hemisphere ﬁlament does not obey the well-known hemisphere rule that the chirality of a ﬁlament is
mainly dextral/sinistral in the northern/southern hemisphere (e.g., Ouyang et al. 2017), thus being more plausibly prone to a
major eruption (P. F. Chen, private communication).

Like in a typical two-ribbon ﬂare, the fast rising FR stretches out the overlying ﬁeld lines to drive standard CSHKP ﬂare
reconnection, producing two parallel ﬂare ribbons and bright main ﬂare loops along the southern part of PIL-P2N. In this case,
however, the FR is initially embedded under a fan-spine structure. When it erupts upward, the FR also drives other magnetic
reconnections at the magnetic null-point intersected by the fan-spine ﬁelds lines as well as in the quasi-separatrix layer (QSL)
surrounding the fan dome. As a result, the outer parallel ﬂare ribbon rapidly evolves into a complete circular ribbon (Rc), and a
remote ﬂare ribbon (Rr) appears in the eastern polarity P1, at a distance of 80′′ from the main ﬂare region. Meanwhile, the region
enclosed by the remote ﬂare ribbon quickly turns into a dark dimming, which is due to mass drainage along the large-scale ﬁeld
lines stretched out by the erupting FR (e.g., Xing et al. 2020).

The second-stage ﬂare evolution is characterized by the ejection of another ﬁlament lying along the northern part of PIL-P2N
about 15 minutes later (second row in Figure 4), whose destabilization may be triggered by a removal of the above magnetic
conﬁnement by the ﬁrst-stage FR eruption. The magnetic reconnection driven by this moderate ﬁlament ejection causes bright-
ening of two sets of side-lobe ﬂare loops (most clearly seen in AIA 131 ˚A) south and east of the uprising ﬁlament, respectively,
analogous to the breakout reconnection as proposed by Antiochos et al. (1999).

In the last stage, much longer ﬂare loops connecting the large-scale bipolar polarities P1 and N are observed (bottom two rows
in Figure 4). Since these loops appear in AIA 335 ˚A well after the main phase peak (over an hour), they deﬁnitely belong to ELP
loops. In AIA 335 ˚A, the ELP loops are rather diffuse over a large area, with their eastern footpoint rooted on the previously
brightening remote ﬂare ribbon Rr. Nevertheless, in the other two AIA passbands, the ELP loops are seen as relatively sharp
structures. Their appearance in these passbands is ﬁrst localized within a small region (limited by the black dashed rectangle),
and later spreads to a wider extent (outlined by the white dashed rectangle). Note that during this late stage, the AIA 131 ˚A
passband should be mainly sensitive to cool rather than hot coronal emissions (c.f., O’Dwyer et al. 2010).

The three stages in ﬂare evolution identiﬁed in the spatially resolved AIA observations have a one-to-one temporal correspon-
dence to the three enhancements of the EVE 335 ˚A irradiance in Figure 3(b), validating the identiﬁcation of the ELP in ﬂare F2
from the EVE observations. Actually, the evolution of the AR intensity in each AIA passband, which is derived by summing
the count rate of all pixels over the AR (plotted in Figure 4(m)), shows a close similarity to that of the full-disk irradiance in the
corresponding EVE line, suggesting that the variabilities measured in EVE are predominately contributed by the activities taking
place in the AR. We note that this general similarity holds for most of the ﬂare events studied in this work.

To explore the origin of the ELP in ﬂare F2, we select three sub-regions enclosed by the colored boxes drawn in Figures 4(f)
and (g), representing the main ﬂare region (labeled as R1 in the red box), the ELP loop region (R2 in blue), and the remote
dimming region (R3 in purple), respectively. The background-subtracted light curves of the three sub-regions in AIA 335 ˚A are
plotted in Figure 4(n). As expected, the activities in region R1 dominate the ﬁrst two peaks in the AR-integrated (or whole ﬂare)
light curve, while the variabilities in region R2 make a main contribution to the ELP (the third enhancement). Note that the
former two peaks in the R2 light curve, which are simultaneous with the peaks in the R1 light curve, are mainly caused by the
contamination of CCD-bleed interference stripes extending from the main ﬂare region.

Flare F2 exhibits an extended ELP seen in AIA 335 ˚A, indicating a prolonged heating during this stage. As revealed from the
online animation as well as Figure 3 in Dai et al. (2013), the additional heating during the ELP is evidenced by re-brightening and
eastward expansion of the remote ribbon Rr in the AIA coronal passbands, a signature of ongoing magnetic reconnection. This
magnetic reconnection takes place between the high-lying ﬁeld lines stretched out by the preceding ﬁlament eruption/ejection,
analogous to the main ﬂare CSHKP reconnection but in a much weaker strength. In the AIA 1600 ˚A light curves shown in Figure
4(o), potential enhancements in response to the ELP reconnection are barely discernible. Nevertheless, powered by this weak
but persistent reconnection heating, the background-subtracted intensity over region R3 gradually turns from a depletion shortly
after the main phase peak to an enhancement, which is mainly contributed by the brightening of the ELP loops at their eastern
leg. As the individual ELP loops cool down, they successively appear and disappear in the cooler passbands such as AIA 171
˚A (Figure 4(l)), with such process lasting until the ﬁrst few hours of the next day, further validating the scenario of additional
delayed heating.

In our previous study (Dai et al. 2013), the production of the ELP in this ﬂare was just attributed to the additional heating.
Nevertheless, the brightening of the remote ﬂare ribbon Rr in all three stages suggests that some “ELP” loops anchored on ribbon
Rr have already been heated early in the ﬂare. Powered by the much stronger early stage reconnection heating, these long ﬂare

EUV LATE PHASE IN HOMOLOGOUS FLARES

loops should be initially quite hot (>10 MK) as seen in AIA 131 ˚A (Figures 4(a) and (b)). After experiencing a long cooling
process, they are observed as conventionally deﬁned ELP loops in AIA 335 ˚A much later (Figure 4 (g)), and then appear or
reappear in AIA 131 (now for cool corona, <1 MK) and 171 ˚A (enclosed by the black dashed rectangle in Figures 4(c) and (k)).
Alternatively, the production of these ELP loops should conform to the long-lasting cooling scenario.

To further verify the long-lasting cooling process in these ELP loops, we select such a representative loop from the region
limited by the black dashed rectangle drawn in Figure 4(c), and trace its evolution in Figure 5. As shown in the left panels in
Figure 5, the loop has already brightened up in AIA 131 ˚A during the ﬁrst stage of ﬂare evolution (Figure 5(b)). After a sufﬁciently
long cooling time (∼87 minutes), the loop reappears in AIA 131 ˚A in the last stage (Figure 5(c)). By visually checking the loop
morphology frame by frame, we make sure that the loop structure seen at the two different moments belongs to the same ELP
loop but with different temperatures. We draw a 1.2′′ × 1.2′′ sized small box on the loop spine, over which the intensity proﬁles
in AIA 131 and 335 ˚A are plotted in Figure 5(d). It is found that the observation times of Figures 5(b) and 5(c) correspond to two
local peaks in the AIA 131 ˚A light curve (outlined by the vertical dashed lines). Note that other peaks in the AIA 131 ˚A intensity
proﬁle should be due to the contribution from other ELP loops overlapping along the LOS.

It is also seen that the AIA 335 ˚A intensity proﬁle of the box region shows a slow rise followed by a fast decay during the period
of interest. According to the numerical experiments carried out in Dai & Ding (2018), if an ELP loop is energized simultaneously
with the main ﬂare loops, it will be initially heated to a high temperature and hence experience a “complete” heating-cooling
cycle. As a result, the warm coronal emission peak (e.g., in AIA 335 ˚A) in the ELP loop will occur in the radiative cooling stage
of the loop, and the loop emission after the peak will be notably affected by mass condensation from the loop, hence showing a
fast decay compared to the relatively gradual rise. This numerically predicted emission pattern is qualitatively consistent with the
tendency revealed in the AIA 335 ˚A light curve.

To quantify the cooling process of the loop, we further carry out a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis to the selected
box region using the observations from six AIA coronal passbands. Here we adopt the sparse inversion code developed by
Cheung et al. (2015) and modiﬁed by Su et al. (2018) to perform the DEM inversion. The resulting DEM distributions at the two
AIA 131 ˚A peak times (blue solid histogram) are plotted in Figures 5(e) and (f). Also plotted is the DEM at a pre-ﬂare time
(black solid histogram), which serves as a reference DEM for comparison. At the former (early) AIA 131 ˚A peak (22:24 UT),
the DEM distribution has a prominent bump between log T ∼ 6.8 and log T ∼ 7.2, outside which the DEM closely resembles
the reference pre-ﬂare DEM (Figure 5(e)). Obviously this high temperature component originates from the ELP loop that has
just been heated to a high temperature. Hence we can isolate this component out of the whole temperature range to estimate the
parameters of the heated ELP loop. Adopting the DEM-weighted average, and assuming an LOS loop depth (width) of 1.5 Mm,
the derived average loop temperature T and density n are 11 MK and 1.5 × 1010 cm−3, respectively, typical of a ﬂaring coronal
loop. At the latter (late) AIA 131 ˚A peak (23:51 UT), nevertheless, the high temperature bump totally disappears from the DEM
histogram, and enhancements of the DEM are mainly observed at lower temperatures (log T < 6.3, Figure 5(f)). The change in
DEM distribution clearly demonstrates the long-lasting cooling (over one hour) of the selected ELP loop from a ﬂaring plasma
temperature to the background coronal temperature. In passing we note that there are several missing bins in the DEM plots
at around log T = 5.9, in which the DEM values are orders of magnitude smaller than those in neighboring bins. This might
be a problem with the inversion algorithm itself. Hence it does not physically mean that the DEM at these temperatures is low.
Fortunately, this issue would not compromise the results of our DEM analysis, because we intend to extract quantities of the ELP
loop out from the background corona, especially when it is of high temperature.

Cargill et al. (1995) analytically evaluated the cooling time of a ﬂare loop (cooling down from a high temperature), which is

formulated as

τcool = 2.35 × 10−2L5/6T

−1/6
0

−1/6
0

,

n

(1)

where L is the loop half-length, and T0 (n0) is the loop temperature (density) at the start of the cooling. We use this formula to
estimate the cooling time of the selected ELP loop. By measuring the distance between two footpoints of the loop and assuming
a semi-circular loop geometry, the loop half-length is estimated to be ∼ 7.2 × 109 cm. As to T0 and n0, we adopt the values
derived from the DEM at the ﬁrst AIA 131 ˚A peak. Then the theoretically estimated loop cooling time is 87 minutes, which is
almost the same as the observed cooling time (approximated by the duration between the two peaks in the AIA 131 ˚A light curve
for the box region), therefore serving as another piece of compelling evidence for the mechanism of long-lasting cooling.

In summary, it is found that both the additional heating and the long-lasting cooling mechanisms work in the production of the
ELP in ﬂare F2. The ELP loops produced through the two mechanisms overlap temporally and spatially around the ELP peak,
making it difﬁcult to quantify the relative contribution from each mechanism. We just speculate that at least at the ELP peak,
both mechanisms may play a comparable role.

3.2.2. The September 6 M5.3 Flare

We then turn to ﬂare F1 (September 6 M5.3), the ﬁrst major ﬂare event from AR 11283. As shown in Figure 6, the ﬂare,
involving a similar fan-spine topology, experiences nearly the same three-stage evolution as in ﬂare F2, which is also characterized
by sequential occurrence of the eruption of an FR (from the southern part of PIL-P2N, upper panels), the ejection of a ﬁlament
(from the northern part of PIL-P2N, middle panels), and the brightening of ELP loops (mainly in region R2, lower panels). This
implies that similar magnetic reconnections could be involved in this ﬂare. However, in each stage, the involved reconnection
should be signiﬁcantly weaker than that in ﬂare F2. This is reﬂected from the remote ﬂare ribbon Rr in ﬂare F1, which is
considerably weak and compact, even during the strongest ﬁrst-stage reconnection (see Figure 2(d)). As a result, possible “hot”
ELP loops rooted on ribbon Rr are barely discernible in AIA 131 ˚A during the early stages (Figures 6(a) and (b)), hence ruling
out the possibility of long-lasting cooling as the main mechanism to produce the warm coronal ELP later on.

In AIA 335 ˚A, the brightening of ELP loops occurs much later, and persists for a long time (Figure 6(f)). Like in ﬂare F2, the
AIA 335 ˚A intensity proﬁles for both regions R2 and R3 (deﬁned the same as in ﬂare F2) show an extended slow rise during the
ELP (Figure 6(k)), strongly favoring the additional heating scenario in producing the extended ELP. It is noted that during the
ELP period, the AR-integrated light curve in AIA 335 ˚A mainly reveals a depletion (Figure 6(j)) rather than an enhancement seen
in EVE 335 ˚A (Figure 3(a)). This can be understood in terms of the broad temperature response of the AIA 335 ˚A passband as well
as the weak strength of the delayed ELP heating. Besides warm coronal emissions, AIA 335 ˚A also covers emissions from the
bulk cool corona (c.f., Boerner et al. 2012). In ﬂare F1, the ﬁlament eruption/ejection causes a signiﬁcant mass drainage from the
background/foreground AR, leading to a relatively deep dimming observed in AIA 335 ˚A. Although the late-stage reconnection
heating can make the ELP loops brighten up in a local region within the AR, the heating is so weak that the brightening from the
ELP loops is not enough to compensate for the overall dimming.

3.2.3. The September 7 X1.8 Flare

According to the GOES classiﬁcation, ﬂare F3 (September 7 X1.8) is the second most energetic ﬂare in our event list. The
evolution of the ﬂare is displayed in Figure 7. Compared to the former two ﬂares, ﬂare F3 is driven by the eruption of just one
single sigmoid ﬁlament (or FR, indicated by the arrow in Figure 7(e)), which is also the case for the remaining ﬂare events to be
analyzed. For this ﬂare, the NLFFF extrapolation also reveals a fan-spine magnetic structure lying above the initially EW oriented
FR, with the exception that the connectivity of the outer spine experiences a change between ﬂares F2 and F3: the outer spine
still extends to the northwest shortly after ﬂare F2 (see Jiang et al. 2014), while it has connected northeastward to the eastern
positive polarity P1 before ﬂare F3 (Y. Dai, in preparation). Due to the similarity, the fast rising FR ﬁrst drives similar magnetic
reconnections as in ﬂare F2, i.e., main ﬂare CSHKP reconnection (below the FR) as well as null-point reconnection (above the
FR). Evidence of the null-point reconnection is further revealed from the energization of a bundle of ﬂare loops brightening up in
AIA 335 ˚A from ∼22:50 UT extending northeastward to the remote ribbon Rr (see Figure 7(i) and the online animation), which
are roughly co-spatial with the outer spine ﬁled lines in the NLFFF extrapolation. As the bundled ﬂare loops cool down, they
are more clearly observed in AIA 171 ˚A (covered by the red box in Figure 7(j)). We note that the situation is very similar to the
production of hot spine loops by null-point reconnection as proposed in Sun et al. (2013).

As the FR erupts upward, the FR spine further undergoes a clockwise rotation, whose direction can be determined from the
locations of falling ﬁlament material onto the solar surface (Ouyang et al. 2015). The sense of the rotation follows the chirality
rule, i.e., counterclockwise for a dextral ﬁlament while clockwise for a sinistral ﬁlament (Attrill et al. 2007). As a result of the
rotation, the FR changes from the initial EW orientation to a later north-south (NS) orientation. The change in FR orientation
imposes a signiﬁcant consequence to the follow-up magnetic reconnection. Since the large-scale overlying ﬁeld lines (above the
fan-spine dome) are mainly EW directed, an NS elongated FR can more effectively stretch out a large amount of overlying ﬁeld
lines, facilitating stronger magnetic reconnection between them. Without further stretching by other ﬁlament eruption/ejection,
magnetic reconnection (analogous to the main ﬂare CSHKP reconnection) quickly sets in between the stretched overlying ﬁeld
lines, producing a large-scale cusp-shaped structure (a signature of magnetic reconnection, Tsuneta et al. 1992; Aschwanden
2005) with one footpoint anchored on the remote ribbon Rr (Figure 7(b)). Although the main ﬂare reconnection (creating the
smaller ribbons along polarities P2 and N) and the large-scale CSHKP reconnection (producing the large-scale cusp straddling
on the longer remote ribbon) are spatially separated, the two reconnections are closely linked by the erupting FR. The FR starts
to erupt at ∼22:36 UT, while the large-scale hot cusp structure appears as early as 22:41 UT. This means that the transition in
reconnection location happens within a short time interval (less than 5 minutes). In addition, driven by the FR eruption, both
reconnections last for a period of time, hence showing an overlap in time. In this sense, the two reconnections can be regarded to
take place simultaneously.

EUV LATE PHASE IN HOMOLOGOUS FLARES

7

As revealed from both the full-disk irradiance in EVE 335 ˚A (Figure 3(c)) and the AR-integrated intensity in AIA 335 ˚A
(Figure 7(m)), ﬂare F3 exhibits a plateau-like ELP. Through visual inspection of the AIA imaging observations, it is seen that the
plateau ELP emission comes from a series of ELP loops of different lengths, which are heated by the above-mentioned null-point
reconnection or large-scale CSHKP reconnection. Since all reconnections in this ﬂare take place nearly simultaneously, both the
main ﬂare loops and the ELP loops should also appear simultaneously in the hot AIA passbands, as is the case seen in AIA 131
˚A (Figures 7(a) and (b)). As the ELP loops cool down, the difference in loop length leads to a difference in cooling rate of the
ELP loops, which makes the brightening of different ELP loops more and more separated in time, especially seen in the cool AIA
171 ˚A passband (Figures 7(j)–(l)). In the warm AIA 335 ˚A passband, nevertheless, the time lags between the emission peaks of
ELP loops are not so large. Therefore, the ELP loops of different lengths brighten up and fade off in close succession (Figures
7(f)–(h)), making the overall warm coronal ELP emission rather ﬂatted.

We further pick up three sets of ELP loops (I, II, and III) that have increasing lengths. Note that loops I correspond to the hot
spine energized by the null-point reconnection, and loops II and III are related to the initially hot cusp produced by the large-scale
CSHKP reconnection. In each set of loops, we extract a segment region (outlined by the colored boxes R1, R2, and R3) to trace
the loop intensity in AIA 335 ˚A. As displayed in Figure 7(n), the AIA 335 ˚A intensity proﬁles of the three loop segments exhibit
a gradual rise shortly after the main phase peak, attain the peak in an order of increasing loop lengths, and then turn to a relatively
faster decay. The pattern of the light curves is quite similar to that plotted in Figure 5(d). In addition, when the intensity of the
longest ELP loops III starts to decrease, the AR light curve in AIA 335 ˚A has also fallen back toward the background level. All
these observational facts suggest that long-lasting cooling should be the dominant mechanism to produce the ELP in ﬂare F3.

3.2.4. The September 8 M6.7 and September 9 M2.7 Flares

Figures 8 and 9 depict the evolution of ﬂares F4 (September 8 M6.7) and F5 (September 9 M2.7), respectively. Like ﬂare
F3, both ﬂares are driven by the eruption of an EW oriented ﬁlament FR (pointed out by the arrows in Figures 8(d) and 9(d))
from the similar location under a fan-spine dome. Therefore, similar magnetic reconnections (responsible for the production of
either main ﬂare loops or ELP loops) should be involved in the two ﬂares as those in ﬂare F3. Nevertheless, the direction of the
FR eruption is different between ﬂares F4 and F5. The FR in ﬂare F4 exhibits a northwestward propagation in the plane of the
sky. A large fraction of the cold ﬁlament material falls back after the ﬁlament reaches its highest altitude (Figure 8(h)), with the
runaway part forming a weak CME event with a low projected speed (214 km s−1) and narrow angular width (37◦) in LASCO
C2 camera (Zhang et al. 2015). This may explain why the ﬂare is not accompanied by a type II burst in contrast to other eruptive
events. In ﬂare F5, the direction of the FR eruption is instead southeastward, which is further conﬁrmed by the appearance of a
corresponding CME in a southeast position angle (254◦) later on. Since the ELP loops are produced by the magnetic reconnection
between large-scale overlying ﬁeld lines stretched out by the erupting FR, the location of the ELP loops should also follow the
direction of the FR eruption, which is indeed the case seen in ﬂares F4 and F5. In ﬂare F4, diffused ELP loops span diagonally
over the northern part of the AR (traced by the dashed line in Figure 8(f)), while in ﬂare F5, the ELP loops are mainly located in
the south (indicated by the arrow in Figure 9(f)).

In ﬂares F4 and F5, both the full-disk irradiance in EVE 335 ˚A (Figures 3(d) and (e)) and the AR-integrated intensity in AIA
335 ˚A (Figures 8(j) and 9(j)) reveal an elevated post-ﬂare “background” relative to the pre-ﬂare level, which largely smears out
the true contribution from the ELP loops. To extract the true ELP emissions, we select several sub-regions from the AR (enclosed
by the colored boxes in Figures 8 and 9) and track the intensity evolution in AIA 335 ˚A over these regions (shown in Figures 8(k)
and 9(k)), as we have done before.

For ﬂare F4, the intensity of the main ﬂare region (R1 in red) drops from the main phase peak to the pre-ﬂare level ﬁnally.
Possibly due to a partial eruption of the FR, the region enclosed by the remote ribbon Rr, which typically exhibits a dimming
during other eruptive ﬂares, does not show obvious changes in this ﬂare. For this reason, we combine it into the extended ELP
loop region (R2 in blue, excluding the extent of region R1). Unlike the ﬂat AR light curve after the main phase peak, the intensity
proﬁle of region R2 now reveals a second enhancement of ﬁnite duration (∼2 hours), which may constitute the true ELP of the
ﬂare. Afterwards, the main contributor to the elevated AR emission appears to switch to a southern region of the AR (R3 in pink).
It is seen that region R3 covers a series of long coronal loops emanating from the southwest peripheral of the AR. During the
ﬂare, the loops continue to brighten up in AIA 335 ˚A (Figures 8(e) and (f)), while in AIA 171 ˚A, they show a persistent dimming,
which can be easily discerned from the plain images (Figures 8(h) and (i)). The emission pattern indicates a persistent heating
of moderate strength in these loops, which mainly raises the loop temperature to a warm coronal temperature (e.g., ∼ 3 MK).
Although the loops in region R3 are long relative to the main ﬂare loops, and they brighten up in AIA 335 ˚A in the late stage,
they do not belong to ELP loops like those in region R2. The most important difference is that the loops in region R3 have not
been disturbed by the FR eruption, and hence do not participate in any ﬂare-related magnetic reconnections. In passing we note

8

ZHONG ET AL.

that the heating of these non-ELP loops is more likely due to continuous low atmospheric activities (e.g., magnetic emergence
and/or cancellation) taking place at the loop footpoint in AR peripheral, which is certainly irrelevant to the course of the ﬂare.

For ﬂare F5, the situation is quite similar, except that a discernible dimming occurs in the remote dimming region (R3 in purple)
as desired. (For this reason here we pick it up separately.) After eliminating the contribution from the remote dimming region
and the main ﬂare region (R1 in red), the intensity proﬁle of the ELP loop region (R2 in blue) also reveals a ﬁnite duration in
ELP enhancement, which lasts for ∼2.5 hours. After the ELP peak, the elevated AR emission mainly comes from the brightening
of loops in a northern region of the AR (R4 in olive). The position of region R4 is away from the direction of the FR eruption
(southwestward in this event). For the same reason, the loops in region R4 are not ELP loops, and the heating mechanism in these
non-ELP loops is believed to be identical to that in ﬂare F4.

In both ﬂares, a true ELP peak is revealed from the sub-region light curve. The ELP emission starts to increase shortly after
the main phase peak and the time lag between the ELP peak and the main phase peak (∼1 hour) is comparable to the cooling
time of a long ﬂaring loop. In AIA images, the ELP loops are observed sequentially from the hot passband to the cool passband.
Therefore, the long-lasting cooling mechanism should be responsible for the production of the ELP in these two ﬂares.

3.2.5. The September 9 M1.2 Flare

Flare F6 (September 9 M1.2) is the only conﬁned event in our dataset. Evolution of the ﬂare is displayed in Figure 10. Different
from all other ﬂares, the ﬂare-driving FR in this ﬂare is initially NS oriented (Figure 10(d)), which implies that the uprising FR
would suffer much more conﬁnement imposed by the overlying EW elongated ﬁeld lines, therefore stable against the torus
instability (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006). This may partially explain why this ﬂare is non-eruptive compared to other eruptive ﬂares.

Based on an NLFFF extrapolation and hydrodynamic modeling, Dai et al. (2018) have proposed a two-stage magnetic re-
connection process to explain the ﬂare evolution. The ascending FR ﬁrst squashes the above fan-spine structure, and drives
reconnections at the null point and the surrounding QSL, producing the remote brightening ﬂare ribbon and long ELP loops
(Figure 10(a)). The second-stage reconnection sets in just 5 minutes later; reconnection mainly occurs between the two legs of
the ﬁeld lines stretched by the eventually stopped FR, energizing the compact main ﬂare loops (Figure 10(e)). The two stages of
reconnection manifest themselves as two adjacent peaks in the AIA 1600 ˚A light curve of the AR (solid curve in Figure 10(l)).
The ﬁrst-stage reconnection is believed to be more energetic, therefore resulting in an extremely large ELP (Figures 3(f) and
10(j)).

At the time of ﬂare F6, the AR has rotated to a location close to the western limb. In the main ﬂare region (R1 in red), the AIA
335 ˚A intensity proﬁle also reveals a large ELP peak (Figure 10(k)), which is mainly contributed by a large amount of ELP loops
overlapping along the LOS. To reliably trace the evolution of the ELP free of contamination from the main ﬂare region, we select
an eastern region (R2 in blue) that only covers the eastern part of the ELP loops. As expected, the intensity in region R2 shows a
gradual rise and a fast decay (Figure 10(l)), indicating a “complete” long-lasting cooling process in the initially hot ELP loops.

3.3. Correlation between the Flares

According to the analysis presented above, the main production mechanism of the ELP for the six homologous ﬂares from AR
11283, changes from additional heating in ﬂare F1 to long-lasting cooling in ﬂares F3–F6, with both mechanisms playing a role
in ﬂare F2. As revealed in Table 2, the time lag of the ELP peak in EVE 335 ˚A, measured with respect to the AIA 1600 ˚A peak
of either the whole ﬂare or the remote ribbon (here we adopt the latter one), shows an abrupt drop after ﬂare F2. The signiﬁcantly
longer time delay of the ELP peak in the ﬁrst two ﬂares (especially for ﬂare F1) indicates that an additional heating is needed to
further postpone the occurrence of the ELP peak.

To further validate the long-lasting cooling scenario for ﬂares F3-F6, we also pick up one representative ELP loop from each
event of them (traced by the dashed curves in Figures 7(h) and 8-10(f)), and carry out the same DEM analysis and cooling time
estimation of the loops as done in ﬂare F2. The results are listed in Table 3. All these ELP loops experience a brightening-
fading-brightening process in AIA 131 ˚A. The ﬁrst AIA 131 ˚A peak appears shortly after the corresponding main ﬂare peak.
The DEM analysis at these times (second column) reveals temperatures around 10 MK and densities around 2 × 1010 cm−3 for
the ELP loops. It is clear that the ELP loops are heated nearly simultaneously with the main ﬂare heating and cool down from
an initially high temperature. When they brighten up again in AIA 131 ˚A (third column), the elapsed times (fourth column) are
regarded as the observed loop cooling times tcool. It is found that the observed cooling times of the loops are in good agreement
with the theoretically estimated values τcool (sixth column), which are derived by using equation (1), with the relative difference
between them being less than 10%. This strongly favors the long-lasting cooling process in the ELP loops. In passing we note
that according to equation (1), the loop cooling time mainly depends on the loop half-length L (ﬁfth column), whereas it is rather
insensitive to the initial temperature and density, as long as the loop is initially hot enough.

EUV LATE PHASE IN HOMOLOGOUS FLARES

We further investigate the correlation between the ELP peak intensity in AIA 335 ˚A and the AIA 1600 ˚A ﬂuence of either the
whole ﬂare or the remote ribbon (derived by integrating the solid and dashed curves in Figures 4(o), 6(l), 7(o), and 8(l)–10(l),
respectively), a possible relationship analogous to the well-known Neupert effect (Neupert 1968). The original Neupert effect
relates the time-integrated hard X-ray (HXR) emission of a solar ﬂare to its SXR ﬂux. Using the UV footpoint calorimeter (UFC)
method that infers ﬂare heating from AIA 1600 ˚A light curves at the footpoints of ﬂare loops, recently Qiu (2021) has success-
fully modeled the observed SXR emission in several solar ﬂares. Meanwhile, through 0D hydrodynamic numerical experiments,
Dai & Ding (2018) found that under a sufﬁciently strong heating, ﬂare loops will experience a self-similar thermodynamic evo-
lution until they cool down to an intermediate temperature, e.g., 3 MK. In this sense, a correlation between AIA 1600 ˚A ﬂuence
and AIA 335 ˚A intensity would be of physical signiﬁcance. The reason for additionally extracting the ﬂuence from the remote
ribbon is that most ELP loops are found connecting to the remote ribbon.

To more accurately quantify the ELP emission, we ﬁrst adopt the method described in Chen et al. (2020) to determine the
“exact” spatial extent of the ELP loops. For each ﬂare, we subtract the AIA 335 ˚A image at the main phase peak from the
corresponding image at the ELP peak. In the resultant difference image, pixels with positive values (or more strictly speaking,
above a positive threshold value) are included into the ELP region, while those with negative values (below a negative threshold
value) belong to the main ﬂare region. The spatial extents of the ELP region (blue) and the main ﬂare region (red) for all six
ﬂares are displayed in Figure 11. It is clearly seen that the ELP region occupies a signiﬁcantly larger area than the main ﬂare
region. Based on the ﬁgure, the ELP intensity is computed by summing all pixel values over the marked ELP region. To evaluate
the uncertainty introduced by the ELP peak time determination, we apply the same operation to all AIA 335 ˚A images within a
10-minute time window centered at the determined ELP peak time, which results in a total of 51 ELP intensities for each ﬂare.
The average of these intensities is taken as the ELP peak intensity, and their standard deviation is regarded as the uncertainty. It is
found that the uncertainty of the ELP peak intensity is typically small, within the 3% level for all ﬂares under study. The reason
for the small uncertainty lies in the long lengths of the ELP loops, which make the thermodynamic evolution inside them quite
gradual.

The ﬂuence in AIA 1600 ˚A is in practice calculated by integrating the intensity over the impulsive rising phase of the ﬂare light
curve, since the decay phase may be somewhat affected by non-heating effects. We set a threshold of 10 times the background
ﬂuctuation to deﬁne the start point of the impulsive phase. Since here the background level of all AIA 1600 ˚A light curves is very
steady, using different thresholds in a wide range actually does not affect the ﬁnal results. In addition, due to the complexity of
the ﬂares, here the whole ﬂare light curves typically exhibit multiple spikes around the peak. Therefore, in deriving the whole
ﬂare ﬂuence, we alternatively integrate the AIA 1600 ˚A intensity until it drops to half the peak.

Scatter plots of the quantities calculated above are shown in Figure 12. In both plots, with the aid of a power-law ﬁtting (red
line), a positive correlation between the ELP peak intensity and the ﬂare ribbon ﬂuence is established for the ﬁve eruptive ﬂare
events. The correlation coefﬁcient for the case of the remote ribbon ﬂuence (0.946, lower panel) is considerably higher than that
for the case of the whole ﬂare ﬂuence (0.811, upper panel), indicating a much closer physical link between the brightening of the
remote ribbon and the heating of the ELP loops as expected. Since the remote ribbon attains the peak nearly simultaneously with
other ﬂare ribbons, this high correlation coefﬁcient strongly favors the long-lasting cooling scenario in producing the ELP. At
ﬁrst glance, this argument seems to contradict the ELP production scenario in ﬂare F1. We note that both the ELP peak intensity
and the remote ribbon ﬂuence in ﬂare F1 are the weakest among all ﬂares in our dataset. Hence the proximity of the data point
for ﬂare F1 to the ﬁtting line should just be a coincidence. It is also worth noting that in the lower panel, the data point for ﬂare
F2 lies well above the ﬁtting line. It is not hard to understand, since the additional heating in this ﬂare may further enhance the
ELP peak.

As to the only non-eruptive ﬂare F6, the corresponding data point is totally an outlier in the upper panel, but moves closer to
the ﬁtting line in the lower panel. It basically indicates a long-lasting cooling process taking effect in ﬂare F6. However, for this
conﬁned ﬂare, the signiﬁcantly higher ELP peak intensity compared to that inferred from the correlation may imply a different
energy partitioning inside the ELP loops.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Using the observations with SDO, we investigate the production of the ELP in six homologous ﬂares (F1–F6) originating from
a complex AR NOAA 11283, with an emphasis on the emission characteristics of the ﬂares. It is found that the main production
mechanism of the ELP changes from additional heating in ﬂare F1 to long-lasting cooling in ﬂares F3–F6, with both mechanisms
playing a role in ﬂare F2. This transition is evidenced by an abrupt decrease of the time lag of the ELP peak. Furthermore,
a positive correlation between the ﬂare ribbon ﬂuence and the ELP peak intensity is established in the majority of the ﬂares,
suggesting a long-lasting cooling process following an early heating in the ELP loops.

10

ZHONG ET AL.

The change in ELP production mechanism after ﬂare F1 may be attributed to an enhancement of the envelope (or overlying)
magnetic ﬁeld above the AR, which not only brings forward the time of the interaction between the rising FR and the large-scale
overlying magnetic ﬁeld lines, but also enhances the strength of the interaction. Compared to the heating in ﬂare F1, the enhanced
interaction in the following ﬂares causes a more prompt and energetic heating of the ELP loops, leading to a more notable ELP
after a sufﬁciently long cooling time. Evidence of the enhancement of envelope magnetic ﬁeld relies on a detailed investigation
of the AR magnetic evolution, which is beyond the scope of this work, and we will present it in a separate work.

The orientation of the ascending FR is another important factor affecting the interaction between the FR and the overlying ﬁeld
lines. When the FR is mainly NS oriented, it will either push or stretch more overlying EW elongated ﬁeld lines, consequently
more effectively energizing the ELP loops. It is noted that an NS oriented FR was involved in ﬂares F3 (after a clockwise rotation)
and F6. As revealed in Figure 12, these two ﬂares produce the largest ELP peaks among all ﬂares. In addition, the enhanced
interaction also imposes a higher conﬁnement on the rising FR. If the FR is not energetic enough, its ascent would be more subject
to the torus instability (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006), resulting in a failed eruption. This may partially explain why the least energetic
(according to the GOES classiﬁcation) ﬂare F6 in our dataset is non-eruptive compared to other eruptive ﬂares.

In our dataset, the only conﬁned ﬂare F6 produces an extremely large ELP peak (relative to the main ﬂare peak). This is
consistent with the argument in Wang et al. (2016) that a strong constraint of the overlying arcades may prevent an FR from
escaping, and cause the energy carried by the FR to be re-deposited into the thermal emissions that form a stronger late phase.
Interestingly, the ﬂare heating does not power compatibly strong brightening in the chromospheric ribbon (see Figure 12). We
attribute it to a different energy partitioning in the ELP loops for this conﬁned ﬂare. Different from other eruptive ﬂares, the ELP
loops in this ﬂare are mainly heated by slipping or slip-running reconnection taking place in the QSL (Dai et al. 2018). In such
QSL reconnection, the released magnetic energy should be more likely to be converted to thermal component through ohmic
dissipation rather than to non-thermal electrons. Compared to thermal component, the non-thermal electron bombardment can
cause more signiﬁcant responses in chromospheric radiation (c.f. Hong et al. 2019), although the two components may have a
similar effect in raising the coronal emission.

Figure 1. Time proﬁles of the GOES ﬂuxes in the long (1–8 ˚A, red) and short bands (0.5–4 ˚A, blue), respectively. The arrows point out 7
M-and-above ﬂares (F1–F7) originating from AR 11283, with the class of each ﬂare labeled beside the ﬂare peak. Note that the peak of ﬂare F5
is missed by GOES due to orbit shading, so the peak time (vertical dashed line) and peak intensity of the ﬂare are inferred from the observations
with other instruments that cover the similar wavelength range.

Figure 2. HMI LOS magnetogram of AR 11283 before each ﬂare (a–c and g–i), and AIA 1600 ˚A image of the corresponding ﬂare around the
ﬂare peak (d–f and j–l). P1, P2, and N represent three main polarities of the AR, while Rc (Rr) denotes a circular (remote) ﬂare ribbon located
in polarity N (P1).

Figure 3. Background-subtracted irradiance of the ﬂares under study in three EVE lines labeled in the legend. The arrows and dash-dot lines
outline the ELP peak of the Fe XVI 335 ˚A line irradiance (black) for each ﬂare. Note that the ELP peaks in ﬂares F4 and F5 are inferred from
the spatially resolved AIA observations.

Figure 4. Evolution of the September 6 X2.1 ﬂare. Left: Images of the ﬂare taken by AIA in 131 (a)–(d), 335 (e)–(h), and 171 ˚A (i)–(l),
respectively. Over-plotted on panel (i) are the contours of a pre-ﬂare HMI LOS magnetogram at levels of ±250, ±600, and ±950 G (red for
positive, and blue for negative). Some characteristic structures during the ﬂare evolution are highlighted by the arrows or dashed rectangles; see
the text for a detailed description. Right: Light curves of the ﬂare in different AIA passbands. Panel (m) displays the AR relative variabilities
(with the background-subtracted value scaled by the corresponding background level) in AIA 131, 335, and 171 ˚A, respectively. Panel (n)
shows the background-subtracted AIA 335 ˚A intensity proﬁles in three sub-regions (labeled as R1, R2, and R3, respectively) outlined by the
colored boxes in panels (f) and (g). Panel (o) displays the background-subtracted AIA 1600 ˚A intensity proﬁles for the whole AR (solid) and
the remote ﬂare ribbon region (dashed). The vertical dash-dot line in panel (n) denotes the ELP peak of the full-disk irradiance in EVE 335 ˚A
(23:49 UT), which is nearly simultaneous with the ELP peak of the AR intensity in AIA 335 ˚A, and is also very close to the ELP peak of the
intensity in region R2.

Figure 5. Left: AIA 131 ˚A images taken at the pre-ﬂare (a), the early (b), and the late (c) stage of the ﬂare evolution in the September 6 X2.1
ﬂare, showing the heating and cooling process of a representative ELP loop. The ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of the panels is outlined by the black
dashed rectangle in Figure 4(c). A small box is drawn on the loop spine. Upper right: Intensity proﬁles of the selected box region in AIA 131
and 335 ˚A. The vertical dashed lines indicate two local peaks in the AIA 131 ˚A light curve, which correspond the observation times of panels
(b) and (c). Lower right: DEM distributions of the box region at the two AIA 131 ˚A peak times (blue solid histogram) as well as at the pre-ﬂare
time (black solid histogram). In each panel, the over-plotted hatched histograms are the results of 100 Monte Carlo runs by randomly adjusting
the inputs within the corresponding standard deviation.

corresponding Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. Note that the vertical error bars over-plotted on the data points indicate the uncertainty in ELP
peak intensity.
