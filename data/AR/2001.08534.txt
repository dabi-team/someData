ABSTRACT
Two mechanisms of gravitational waves (GWs) emission in fast-spinning white dwarfs
(WDs) are investigated: accretion of matter and magnetic deformation. In both cases,
the GW emission is generated by an asymmetry around the rotation axis of the star.
However, in the ﬁrst case, the asymmetry is due to the amount of accreted matter
on the magnetic poles, while in the second case it is due to the intense magnetic
ﬁeld. We have estimated the GW amplitude and luminosity for three binary systems
that have a fast-spinning magnetized WD, namely, AE Aquarii, AR Scorpii and RX
J0648.0-4418. We ﬁnd that, for the ﬁrst mechanism, the systems AE Aquarii and RX
J0648.0-4418 can be observed by the space detectors BBO and DECIGO if they have
an amount of accreted mass of δm ≥ 10−5 M(cid:12). For the second mechanism, the three
systems studied require that the WD have a magnetic ﬁeld above ∼ 109 G to emit
GWs that can be detected by BBO. We also veriﬁed that, in both mechanisms, the
gravitational luminosity has an irrelevant contribution to the spindown luminosity of
these three systems. Therefore, other mechanisms of energy emission are needed to
explain the spindown of these objects.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is an increasing interest of the astrophysics commu-
nity on highly magnetized white dwarfs (HMWDs) both
from the theoretical and observational points of view. These
WDs with surface magnetic ﬁelds from 106 G up to 109 G
have been conﬁrmed by the recent results of the Sloan Digi-
tal Sky Survey (SDSS) (see e.g., K¨ulebi et al. 2009; Kuelebi
et al. 2010; Kepler et al. 2010, 2013, 2015). Besides their
high magnetic ﬁelds, most of them have been shown to be
massive, and responsible for the high-mass peak at 1 M(cid:12) of
the WD mass distribution; for instance: REJ 0317–853 has
M ≈ 1.35 M(cid:12) and B ≈ (1.7–6.6) × 108 G (Barstow et al. 1995;
K¨ulebi et al. 2010); PG 1658+441 has M ≈ 1.31 M(cid:12) and
B ≈ 2.3 × 106 G (Liebert et al. 1983; Schmidt et al. 1992);
and PG 1031+234 has the highest magnetic ﬁeld B ≈ 109 G
(Schmidt et al. 1986; K¨ulebi et al. 2009). The existence of
ultra-massive WDs has been revealed in several studies (see
e.g., Althaus et al. 2005, 2007; Castanheira et al. 2013; Her-
mes et al. 2013; Curd et al. 2017; Camisassa et al. 2019;
Gentile Fusillo et al. 2018; Jim´enez-Esteban et al. 2018).

Typically, WDs rotate with periods of days or even

years. Recently, a pulsating WD was discovered, called AR
Scorpii, that emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths, puls-
ing in brightness with a period of 1.97 min (Marsh et al.
2016). The spindown power is an order of magnitude larger
than the observed luminosity (dominated by the X-rays),
which together with the absence of obvious signs of accre-
tion suggests that AR Sco is primarily rotation-powered.
Furthermore, other sources have been proposed as candi-
dates of WD pulsars. A speciﬁc example is AE Aquarii, the
ﬁrst WD pulsar identiﬁed, with a short rotation period of
P = 33.08 s (Terada et al. 2008). On the other hand, the
X-ray Multimirror Mission (XMM) - Newton satellite has
observed a WD faster than AE Aquarii. Mereghetti et al.
(2009) showed that the X-ray pulsator RX J0648.0-4418 (RX
J0648, hereafter) is a massive WD with mass M = 1.28M(cid:12)
and radius R = 3000 km (see Althaus, L. G. et al. 2005,
2007, for derived mass-radius relations for massive oxygen-
neon WDs that predict this radius), with a very fast spin
period of P = 13.2 s, that belongs to the binary system HD
49798/RX J0648.0-4418.

On the other hand, direct observations of GWs have
recently been made by LIGO and Virgo. As is well known,
the ﬁrst event was detected in 2015 by LIGO (Abbott et al.
2016). This event, named GW150914, came from the merg-
ing of two black holes of masses ∼ 35.6 M(cid:12) and 30.6 M(cid:12)
that resulted in a black hole of mass ∼ 63.1 M(cid:12). There-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2 M. F. Sousa et al.

after, LIGO in collaboration with Virgo observed 9 more
such events (Abbott et al. 2017a,b,d, 2019). In addition, the
event GW170817 reports the ﬁrst detection of GWs from a
binary neutron star inspiral (Abbott et al. 2017c).

All GW detections are within a frequency band ranging
from 10 Hz to 1000 Hz, which is the operating band of LIGO
and Virgo. As is well known, there are proposed missions for
lower frequencies, such as LISA (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017;
Robson et al. 2019), whose frequency band is of (10−4 − 0.01)
Hz, BBO (Harry et al. 2006; Yagi & Seto 2011) and DECIGO
(Kawamura et al. 2006; Yagi & Seto 2017) in the frequency
band ranging from 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz.

Diﬀerent possibilities of generation of continuous GWs
have already been proposed (see e.g., Bonazzola & Gourgoul-
hon 1996; De Araujo et al. 2016a,b; Mukhopadhyay et al.
2017; De Araujo et al. 2017; Gao et al. 2017; Franzon &
Schramm 2017; Pereira et al. 2018; De Araujo et al. 2019,
and references therein). More recently, Kalita & Mukhopad-
hyay (2019) show that continuous GWs can be emitted from
rotating magnetized WDs and will possibly be detected by
the upcoming GW detectors such as LISA, DECIGO and
BBO. Here we explore two mechanisms of gravitational ra-
diation emission in fast-spinning magnetized WD: accretion
of matter and magnetic deformation. In both cases, the GW
emission is generated by asymmetry around the rotation axis
of the star.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2 we describe
the two mechanisms of GW emission by deducting the equa-
tions for gravitational amplitude and luminosity. In Sec. 3
we present the calculations applied to three binary systems
that have a fast-spinning magnetized WD: AE Aqr, AR Sco,
and RX J0648. Moreover, we discuss the results obtained in
this section. Finally, in Sec. 4 we summarize the main con-
clusions and remarks.

2 GRAVITATIONAL EMISSION

MECHANISMS

WDs might generate GWs whether they are not perfectly
symmetric around their rotation axes. This asymmetry can
occur due to the accretion of matter (Choi & Yi 2000) or
due to the huge dipole magnetic ﬁeld that can make the star
become oblate (Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953). In this work,
we analyze the emission of gravitational radiation from fast
magnetized WDs by these two mechanisms.

2.1 Accretion of matter

Here we show the luminosity and the amplitude of the GW
for the case of a WD accreting matter via the magnetic poles,
which do not coincide with the rotation axis of the star.
In this scenario, the secondary star of the system transfers
matter to the WD via an accretion column, without forming
a disk, and accumulating an amount of mass on the magnetic
poles (see, Welsh et al. 1998; Warner 2003; Hellier 2001;
Lamb & Melia 1987; Lubow & Shu 1975, and references
therein).

This conﬁguration has been considered by Choi & Yi
(2000) to obtain AE Aqr’s gravitational counterpart, where
they assume that the spindown energy is not directly con-
nected to any observable electromagnetic emission, but the

high spindown would be caused by the accreted matter that
slowly spreads over the star’s surface and generates grav-
itational radiation. It is worth mentioning that we do not
consider that all spindown is due to GWs and we have es-
tablished diﬀerent values for the amount of mass to calculate
the observable GW amplitude.

Thus, we consider a rigid object, whose axes of symme-
try are (x1, x2, x3), and the corresponding main moments
of inertia are I1, I2 and I3, respectively. This solid rotates
with angular velocity ω with respect to an axis that makes
an angle θ with the x3 axis. Moreover, we consider that the
magnetic dipole axis is also given by the x3 axis.

With this conﬁguration and doing I1 = I2, the gravi-
tational amplitude and luminosity are given respectively by
(see, e.g., Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983; Maggiore 2008)

where r is the distance to the emitting source.

Now, to determine the moments of inertia I1 and I3,
we consider that the object has deformities or an amount of
mass accumulated about the x3 axis. We reduce this system
to a large sphere with two smaller spheres of matter on the x3
axis: one at each of the poles of the larger sphere. This would
be equivalent to a WD accreting matter by the two magnetic
poles, where the magnetic poles do not coincide with the
rotation axis of the star. Therefore, it follows immediately
that

where M is the mass of the star, R is the radius of the star,
δm is the amount of mass accumulated on one magnetic pole
and a is the radius of this amount.

Considering that R (cid:29) a, the term I1 − I3 can be ex-

pressed as follows

I1 − I3 = 2δm R2.

By substituting this last expression into equations (1) and

Thereby, we ﬁnd expressions for the gravitational luminosity
and the GW amplitude for the case of a WD accumulating
mass, which depends on the accreted mass, the distance to
the source, the radius of the star and how fast it is rotating.

2.2 Magnetic deformation

This section deals with the deformation of the WD induced
by its own huge magnetic ﬁeld. Let us consider that the
WD is triaxial, that is, the star has asymmetries with re-
spect to its rotation axis, presenting a triaxial moment of
inertia. In order to investigate the eﬀect arising from the
magnetic stress on the equilibrium of stars, let us introduce
the equatorial ellipticity, deﬁned as (Shapiro & Teukolsky
1983; Maggiore 2008)

Thus, we can consider an eﬃciency, ηd f , for the variation of
the rotation frequency as follows

(cid:219)frot,

(cid:219)¯frot = ηd f
such that (cid:219)¯frot can be interpreted as the part of
(cid:219)frot related
to the GW brake. Hence, the GW amplitude can be written
as follows

where I1, I2 and I3 are main moments of inertia with respect
to the (x, y, z) axes, respectively.

If the star rotates around the z−axis, then it will emit
monochromatic GWs with a frequency twice the rotation
frequency, frot , and amplitude given by (Shapiro & Teukol-
sky 1983; Maggiore 2008)

Now, we are ready to calculate the GW amplitude and
luminosity for massive fast-spinning WDs. The next section
is devoted to this issue as well as the corresponding discus-
sion of the results.

Note that the two equations just above depend on the

rotation frequency and the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

In contrast, the GWs amplitude can also be written as
a function of the variation of the star’s rotation frequency
(cid:219)frot . In this case, we must consider that the whole spindown
luminosity is converted into GWs. Therewith, we infer an
upper limit for amplitude of GWs given by (Aasi et al. 2014)

This equation must be modiﬁed to take into account
that just a part of the spindown is due the GW emission.

MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2019)

AE Aqr, is a cataclysmic variable considered peculiar be-
cause it has a WD with a very short period of rotation of
P = 33.08 s, and a high spindown rate (cid:219)P = 5.64 × 10−14 s
s−1 (see Table 1). This value is considered high because the
energy rate needed to explain the WD period variation far
exceeds the quiescent luminosity observed in the ultraviolet
and X-ray band or even much higher than the bolometric
luminosity (Choi & Yi 2000).

Several works proposed diﬀerent energy emission mech-
anisms to explain these high spindown. Eracleous & Horne
(1996) proposed a magnetic propeller model, in which the
accretion ﬂux of matter by WD is fragmented into discrete
amount of mass accumulated and follows the path of the
magnetic ﬁeld lines. However, the fast-rotating magnetic
WD moves like a fast-moving propeller expelling much of
the matter from the system. Thus, the spindown energy is
consumed to expel the matter. Also, Choi & Yi (2000) pro-
posed as an alternative spindown mechanism an unconven-
tional conﬁguration for AE Aqr. In this scenario, the WD
has a magnetic dipole whose axis is misaligned with the axis
of rotation. The source is accreting matter so that the ac-
cretion ﬂux follows the ﬁeld lines to the magnetic poles, and
the rapid spindown is caused by the mountains of accreted
matter that produces an asymmetrical deformation in the
star structure generating gravitational radiation. This will
be the scenario considered in this work to calculate the GW
amplitude due to the accretion of matter (see section 2.1).
Here, we apply equation (6) for the system AE Aqr,
and extend to AR Sco and RX J0648 in order to calculate
the GW amplitude for these objects, considering the sce-
nario of an amount of mass accumulated on the magnetic
poles. Moreover, an interesting possibility for the AR Sco
is that it may represent an advanced evolutionary stage of
the intermediate polar. That is, the magnetic WD may have
accreted matter from its companion star by an accretion col-
umn, causing it to spin faster and faster until it has reached
a very short rotation period (see Table 1).

For these studies, we consider that the angle between
the magnetic and rotation axes is θ = 30◦. As a result the

(17)

The above equation shows that the amplitude depends on
the amount of mass accumulated; however, it is not easy to
predict how much matter may have been accreted to WD
and how much has been dispersed on its surface. Therefore,
we assign here four values for the mountain of matter for the
three analyzed systems: δm = (10−3 M(cid:12), 10−4 M(cid:12), 10−5 M(cid:12),
10−6 M(cid:12)) (see e.g., Welsh et al. 1998; Warner 2003; Hellier
2001; Lamb & Melia 1987; Lubow & Shu 1975, for details
about accretion in WDs).

In addition, assuming these values for δm and the pa-
rameters listed in Table 1, we obtain hac for the three sys-
tems, which are shown in Fig. 1. It is worth mentioning that
for the AR Sco system that has a WD in the mass range
of 0.81M(cid:12) < MAR < 1.29M(cid:12) (Franzon & Schramm 2017),
we adopted the mass value of 0.81M(cid:12) to maximize the GW
amplitude. For AE Aqr and RX J0648 systems, although
mass values are not well established, we use the mass values
according to Choi & Yi (2000) and Mereghetti et al. (2011),
respectively.

At this point it is interesting to see what kind of in-
formation we can obtain from these results. Fig. 2 shows
the GW amplitude as a function of the GW frequencies for
each δm and the sensitivity curves of the space detectors
LISA, BBO and DECIGO (Robson et al. 2019; Yagi & Seto
2011, 2017). It is worth mentioning that to plot the sen-
sitivity curves, we use the minimum amplitude, hmin, that
can be measured by the detector, for a periodic signal, for
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and observation time T
(see Maggiore 2008, for more details). Thereby, Fig. 2, as

well as Fig. 4, present the GW amplitudes for the sources
(hac and hde f , respectively) and the sensitivity curves are
set to SNR = 8 and T = 1 year.

Notice from Fig. 2 that the systems AE Aqr and RX
J0648 emit gravitational radiation with amplitudes that can
be detected by BBO and DECIGO as long as δm ≥ 10−5 M(cid:12).
For the AR Sco system, the gravitational radiation emitted
by this mechanism would hardly be able to be detected by
the three space instruments. This system would need to have
a very high mass mountain of ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) to be above, for
example, the sensitivity curve of the BBO detector.

Now, we consider the eﬃciency of this mechanism with
respect to the rotational energy rate lost by the systems.
Firstly, considering that all spindown luminosity is converted
in GWs, we calculate the amount of mass accumulated,
δmsd, required to explain the loss of rotational energy in

3.2 Magnetic deformation

Table 2 shows the values of this parameter for each
source. We note that to explain the spindown luminosity
of the star due only to the emission of GWs by the mass ac-
cretion mechanism, the WDs should have a large amount of
matter at their magnetic poles. The AE Aqr and RX J0648
should have δm ∼ 10−2 M(cid:12) and δm ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12), respectively,
while AR Sco should have an even greater δm, around 10−1
M(cid:12). These values of δm are too large, so this GW generation
mechanism cannot explain the whole spindown luminosity.
We now consider the eﬃciency of the process (ηacr =
LGWa cr /Lsd) for the four δm’s considered above, i.e., how
much of the spindown luminosity is converted to gravita-
tional luminosity for every δm (see Table 3). We ﬁnd that
the contribution of gravitational
luminosity to the spin-
down luminosity is irrelevant, since, for the four values of
δm adopted, the eﬃciency ηacr (cid:28) 1, except for the source
RX J0648 with a δm = 10−3 M(cid:12) which shows an eﬃciency of
17.5% (although this value of δm can be considered too great
for a WD). Therefore, other mechanisms of energy emission
are needed to explain the spindown of the systems consid-
ered here.

MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2019)

In this section, we consider the generation of GWs due to
the deformation of the WD structure of the same binary
systems (AE Aqr, AR Sco and RX J0648) caused by their
own intense magnetic ﬁeld. For this, we use equation (16) to
calculate the GW amplitude as a function of the eﬃciency
ηd f = LGWd e f /Lsd. The GW amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3
as a function of ηd f , where we use the parameters of Table
1 for all three systems.

Fig. 4 shows the strain sensitivities curves for LISA,
BBO and DECIGO for one year of observation time and
SN R = 8 and the GW amplitudes as shown in Fig. 3. It is
worth noting that AE Aqr and AR Sco are detectable by the
LISA detector, only if eﬃciency ηd f ≥ 10−1 and ηd f ≥ 10−2,
respectively. On the other hand, notice that all three systems
are detectable by BBO and DECIGO as long as AE Aqr has
an eﬃciency ηd f ≥ 10−6, AR Sco an eﬃciency ηd f ≥ 10−4
and RX J0648 an eﬃciency ηd f ≥ 10−5. Thus, even if the
GWs have a small contribution to the spindown of these
systems, these sources can emit GWs by the magnetic de-
formation mechanism with amplitudes that can be detected
by the space antennas.

An interesting issue is to calculate the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld needed to generate suﬃcient deformation to
explain all the spindown luminosity. Then, using equation
(12) we calculate the corresponding GW amplitude (see Ta-
ble 4). Notice that the magnetic ﬁeld strength obtained ex-
ceed the upper limit established by the canonical model of
WD pulsars.

Also, we calculate the magnetic ﬁeld strength so that
these sources can be detected by BBO, which is the most
sensitive instrument of the three considered in the present
study. To do so, we use equation (12) together with the min-
imum eﬃciency for which each system is detectable by this
instrument. Table 5 shows the values of these magnetic ﬁelds
along with the amplitude for each system. Notice that the
systems must have WDs with high magnetic ﬁelds, around
(109 − 1010) G, which are about two orders of magnitude
larger than the canonical model of WD pulsars.

In addition, we can further calculate the GW ampli-
tude by considering the upper limit values of the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength, Bdip. Thus, knowing that AE Aqr has
Bdip = 5.0 × 107 G (Isakova et al. 2016), AR Sco has
Bdip = 5.0 × 108 G (Buckley et al. 2017), and RX J0648
has Bdip = 1.01 × 108 G (inferred by the magnetic dipole
model), we use equation (11) to calculate the ellipticity of
the star, and equation (12) to calculate the GW amplitude.
In addition, we compute the gravitational luminosity from
equation (13) and the eﬃciency of this process with respect
to the spindown luminosity.

Table 6 presents the results of this study. Notice that
the amplitudes of the GWs shown in this table is very small
to be observed by the space detectors, since they are well
below their sensitivity curves. Even for 5 years of integration
time, these space instruments will not be able to detect these
sources when considering those magnetic ﬁeld values.

For the three binary systems investigated here, we con-
clude that from the magnetic deformation mechanism, the
WDs require a magnetic ﬁeld above ∼ 109 G to produce
GW amplitudes that can be detectable by BBO, for exam-
ple. These ﬁelds are quite intense, but not unrealistic, since

these WDs with surface magnetic ﬁelds from 106 G up to
109 G have been conﬁrmed by the recent results of SDSS
(K¨ulebi et al. 2009; Kuelebi et al. 2010; Kepler et al. 2010,
2013, 2015).

It it worth stressing that although we are interested in
HMWDs and most of them have been shown to be mas-
sive, it is also important that they be fast-spinning sources,
in order to generate GWs in the frequency band where the
space antennas are more sensitive. We studied here the three
notable sources observed so far that would ﬁt all these condi-
tions (massive, fast-spinning and highly magnetized). More-
over, notice that these three sources are the fastest WDs
ever observed.

Evidently, our approach could be applied to new ob-
servations of massive, fast-spinning and highly magnetized
WDs.

4 SUMMARY

After the detection of GWs from the merger events, the
search for continuous GWs has been of great interest in the
scientiﬁc community. It is well known that, besides com-
pact binaries, rapidly rotating neutron stars are promising
sources of GWs which could be detected in a near future by
Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV), and
also by the planned Einstein Telescope (ET). These sources
generate continuous GWs whether they are not perfectly
symmetric around their rotation axis, i.e., if they present
some equatorial ellipticity. Undoubtedly, fast-spinning WDs
are also good candidates for this purpose. Here we investi-
gate the gravitational radiation from these uncommon WDs,
which have a high rotation (a few seconds to minutes) and
a huge magnetic ﬁelds (106 G to ∼ 1010 G), using two emis-
sion mechanisms: matter accretion and magnetic deforma-
tion. These WDs usually have a high spindown rate that is
not fully explained by the electromagnetic counterpart.

Then, we study the following three binary systems: AE
Aqr, AR Sco and RX J0648. Firstly, we consider the role of
the aforementioned deformation due the accretion of matter
in the putative generation of GWs by the HMWDs. Our
calculations show that the AE Aqr and RX J0648 systems
are good candidates for BBO and DECIGO if they have an
amount of mass accumulated of δm ≥ 10−5 M(cid:12), for 1 year of
integration time. AR Sco, on the other hand, is unlikely to
be detected because it requires a very large amount of mass
accumulated in the magnetic pole of the WD.

Secondly, regarding the magnetic deformation mecha-
nism, we note that the three binary systems studied require
that the WD has a magnetic ﬁeld above ∼ 109 G to emit
gravitational radiation with amplitudes that are detectable
by BBO, for example. However, these WDs are inferred to
have magnetic ﬁelds with intensity around two orders of
magnitude smaller.

In addition, it is worth stressing that the eﬃciency of
both mechanisms (η = LGW /Lsd) is very small when consid-
ering the three binary systems studied. Thus, gravitational
radiation has an irrelevant contribution to the spindown
luminosity of these systems.
