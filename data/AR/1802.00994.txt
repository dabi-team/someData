Abstract

In this paper, we introduce the ﬁrst-order integer-valued autoregressive

(INAR(1)) model, with Poisson-Lindley innovations based on power series

thinning operator. Some mathematical features of this process are given and

estimating the parameters is discussed by three methods; conditional least

squares, Yule-Walker equations and conditional maximum likelihood.Then the

results are studied for three special cases of power series operators. Finally,

some numerical results are presented with a discussion to the obtained results

and Four real data sets are used to show the potentially of the new process.

Keywords:

Integer-value autoregressive processes; Power series distributions; Poisson-Lindley

distribution; Thinning operator; Yule-Walker equations.

Introduction

In the last few decades, discrete valued time series have been played an important

role in scientiﬁc research. Many time series in practice have a discrete nature, such

as: the number of daily accident on the roads, the number of reserved rooms at a

hotel for several days, the number of accidents on a free way every day, the number

of chromosome interchanges in cells, the number foggy days, the number of bases of

DNA sequences, and so on.

Integer-valued time series to model count data are encountered in many con-

text, therefore, the study and analysis of such count time series is important and

motivates a novel research branch with many practical applications. many authors

have been analyze integer-valued time series. Jacobs and Lewis [7, 8, 9] presented

the DARMA models. The INAR(1) process were introduced by Mckenzie [11] and

AL-Osh and Alzaid [3] based on thinning operator. Rist´ıc et al.

[14] introduced

the geometric ﬁrst-order integer-valued autoregressive (NGINAR(1)) process with

geometric marginal distribution. Recently, Aghababaei Jazi et al.

[1] discussed a

new stationary ﬁrst-order integer-valued autoregressive process with zero-inﬂated

Poisson innovations (ZINAR(1)). Aghababaei Jazi et al. [2] proposed the geomet-

ric INAR(1) process with geometric innovations (INARG(1)). Schweer and WeiB

[18] introduced a ﬁrst-order non-negative integer-valued autoregressive process with

compound-Poisson innovations (CPINAR(1)) based on the binomial thinning oper-

ator. Among models based on the generalizations of the binomial thinning operator,

we cite Aly and Bouzar [5] and Rist´ıc et al. [15].

In real-life situations, there are time series of equi-dispersion, over-dispersion

and under-dispersion count data. For over-dispersed count data, the integer-valued

AR(1) models have been introduced not only based on the over-dispersed marginal

distribution but also on the over-dispersed innovations. For example compound

Poisson INAR(1) processes: stochastic properties and testing for over-dispersion

[18], First-order mixed integer-valued autoregressive processes with zero-inﬂated

generalized power series innovations [10], First-order integer-valued AR processes

with zero-inﬂated Poisson innovations [1] and integer-valued AR(1) with geometric

innovations [2].

E. Mahmoudi, A. Rostami and R. Roozegar

Recently, Mohammadpour et al.

[12] proposed a ﬁrst-order integer-valued autore-

gressive process with Poisson-Lindley marginals based on the binomial thinning. The

innovation structure form this model is complex, consequently and the conditional

probabilities of this model do not have a simple form. Also, L´ıvio et al.

intro-

duced an new INAR(1) model with Poisson-Lindley innovations based on the bino-

mial thinning operator, denoted by INARPL(1) model, for modelling non-negative

integer-valued time series with over-dispersion.

In this paper, we propose a new stationary INAR(1) process for modelling count

time series based on the power series thinning operator under Poisson-Lindley inno-

vations. We will provide a comprehensive account of the mathematical properties

of the proposed new process. Using the power series distribution as a thinning

operator has the advantage that this operator contains the Poisson, binomial, bega-

tive binomial and geometric operators as a special case and by ﬁtting this operator

to the count time series data, one can obtain the results of these four operators,

simultaneously.

The motivation for such process arises from its potential in modelling and ana-

lyzing non-negative integer-valued time series when there is an indication of over-

dispersion distributions. The use of innovations that come from the Poisson-Lindley

distribution, (i) has many advantages than the other discrete distributions and

has many applications in biology, (ii) the Poisson-Lindley distribution belongs to

compound Poisson family and has other common properties such as unimodality,

over-dispersion, and inﬁnite divisibility, (iii) the Poisson-Lindley distribution can be

viewed as mixture of geometric and negative binomial distribution which case the

smaller amount of skewness and kurtosis of the Poisson-Lindley distribution than

the negative binomial distribution (see Ghitany and Al-Mutairi, 2009 for more de-

tails about the Poisson-Lindley distribution), (iv) in biological and medical sciences,

the occurrence of successive events is dependent. The Poisson and negative binomial

distributions can not give a reasonable ﬁt to the biological and medical count data,

A new integer-valued AR(1) process based on power series thinning operator

because of the equi-dispersion of Poisson and under-dispersion of negative binomial.

Instead, the Poisson-Lindley distribution is a good candidate for modelling data

in ecology, genetics, biological and medical science because of its over-dispersion

property; [17].

The paper is outlined as follows.

In Section 2, after introducing the Poisson-

Lindley distribution and power series thinning operator, we introduce a new sta-

tionary ﬁrst-order integer-valued autoregressive process with Poisson-Lindley inno-

vations. Several statistical properties of the new process are outlined in this section.

In Section 3 , the estimation methods such as conditional least squares, Yule-Walker

and the maximum likelihood are obtained. Three special cases of the proposed model

are studied in Section 4. Moreover, some numerical results of the estimators are dis-

cussed in Section 5. In Section 6, we provide applications to four real data sets and

discuss the obtained results. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

2 Construction of the model

In this section we introduce a stationary ﬁrst-order integer-valued autoregressive pro-

cess with Poisson-Lindley innovations based on power series operator (PSINARPL(1)).

In this paper, we assume that the innovations of process follow a Poisson-Lindley

distribution, so we focus on some properties of the Poisson-Lindley distribution.

The random variable X is distributed as Poisson-Lindley distribution if its proba-

bility mass function can be written in the form

P (X = x) =

θ2(x + θ + 2)
(θ + 1)x+3

,

x = 0, 1, 2, ...

θ > 0,

which was introduced ﬁrstly by Sankaran [16]. Expectation and variance of this

distribution are given by

E(X) =

θ + 2
θ(θ + 1)

,

V ar(X) =

θ3 + 4θ2 + 6θ + 2
θ2(θ + 1)2

.

Since in the proposed model variance is greater than mean, the model can also be

used for over-dispersed count data modelling.

3 Estimation of model parameters

Suppose that X1, ..., XT , T

∈

N as the time series data, are given. The parameters

α and θ are estimated by the following three methods. To estimate parameter θ, we

use the auxiliary parameter µ.

3.1 Conditional least squares method (CLS)

Conditional least squares estimators of parameters α and µ for model (2.3) is ob-

tained by minimizing the function

where µ = E(Xt). Thus the conditional least squares estimator of parameters α and

µ for model (2.3) are given as follow,

3.2 Yule-Walker estimation

3.3 Maximum likelihood estimation method

Maximum likelihood estimators of α and θ are obtained by maximizing the likelihood

function

L(θ, α

x) = f (x1, ..., xn) = f (x1)f (x2|

x1)...f (xn|

|

xn−1).

Because in general case, obtaining the marginal distribution of X1 is hard, a simple

method to ﬁnd the likelihood function is that we condition on variable X1, such that

f (x1, ..., xn|

x1) =

f (x1, ..., xn)
f (x1)

.

Thus the maximum likelihood estimators of α and θ in the model are obtained by

maximizing the conditional likelihood function that, in general, no closed form for

the conditional maximum likelihood estimates.

4 Special cases of PSINARPL(1)

5 Some numerical results

In this section, for each three models, BINARPL(1), NBINARPL(1) and PINARPL(1),

we produce 1000 samples of size T = 100, 200 and 300 and obtain the estimators

of the parameters using three methods that are presented in the previous section,

then we compare these estimators together.

The average estimators (AE), average bias (ABias) and average root mean square

errors (RMSE) are reported in Tables 1, 2 and 3. In each three proposed models

estimators converge to the true value and also the RMSE decreases when sample

size increases.

In two sub-models, BINARPL(1) and NBINARPL(1), RMSE of the maximum like-

lihood estimators are less than the RMSE of the CLS and YW estimators.

In

PINARPL(1) model, RMSE of the CLS and YW estimators of parameter α are

less than the RMSE of the ML estimator while the RMSE of the ML estimator of

parameter θ is less than the RMSE of the CLS and YW estimators.

6 Real data examples

In this section, to compare the proposed three sub-models together and compare

them with integer-valued AR(1) with Poisson innovations based on binomial op-

erator (INARP(1)) and integer-valued AR(1) with geometric innovations based on

binomial operator (INARG(1)), we apply four real time series data sets.

6.1 The number of earthquakes per year magnitude 7.0 or

greater

The ﬁrst example assumes the number of earthquakes per year magnitude 7.0 or

greater (1900-1998). Time series plot, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation

functions are shown in Figure 2. Sample mean, variance and autocorrelation are

respectively, 20.02, 52.75 and 0.58.

Now, for data modelling, we compare four models. For each model, we calculate

the MLE, CLS and YW of parameters, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and

Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The results are shown in Table 4. According

to Table 4, we see that the AIC and BIC of PINARPL(1) is smaller than the AIC

and BIC of other models and hence the PINARPL(1) gives the best ﬁt to this data

in comparing with NBINARPL(1), BINARPL(1), INARP(1) and INARG(1). So,

autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions are shown in Figure 4. Sample

mean, variance and autocorrelation are respectively, 1.244, 3.489 and 0.35.

6.3 The numbers of Sudden death series

This example assumes the numbers of submissions to animal health laboratories,

monthly 2003-2009, from a region in New Zealand. The submissions can be cate-

gorized in various ways. Data set is Sudden death series and this data is used by

Aghababaei Jazi et al. [2].

Time series plot, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions are shown in

Figure 6. Sample mean, variance and autocorrelation are respectively, 2.0238, 6.529

and 0.59.

Now, for data modelling, we compare four models. The results are shown in

Table 6. According to Table 6, we see that the AIC and BIC of NBINARPL(1) is

smaller than the AIC and BIC of other models and hence, the NBINARPL(1) gives

7 Conclusion

Integer-valued time series models are very applicable in many ﬁelds such as medicine,

reliability theory, precipitation, transportation, hotel accommodation and queuing

theory. So far, many integer-valued autoregressive process have been introduced by

researchers.

In this paper we introduce a new stationary ﬁrst-order integer-valued AR(1) process

with Poisson-Lindley innovations based on power series thinning operator. Some

mathematical features of these processes are given and estimating the parameters is

discussed. Some special cases of this model (INARPL(1) based on binomial operator,

INARPL(1) based on Poisson operator and INARPL(1) based on negative binomial
