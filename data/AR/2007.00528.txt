The search for dark matter, the missing mass of the Universe, is one of the most active ﬁelds of
study within particle physics. The XENON1T experiment recently observed a 3.5σ excess potentially
consistent with dark matter, or with solar axions. Here, we will use the Noble Element Simulation
Technique (NEST) software to simulate the XENON1T detector, reproducing the excess. We utilize
diﬀerent detector eﬃciency and energy reconstruction models, but they primarily impact sub-keV
energies and cannot explain the XENON1T excess. However, using NEST, we can reproduce their
excess in multiple, unique ways, most easily via the addition of 31 ± 11 37Ar decays. Furthermore,
this results in new, modiﬁed background models, reducing the signiﬁcance of the excess to ≤ 2.2σ
at least using non-Proﬁle Likelihood Ratio (PLR) methods. This is independent conﬁrmation that
the excess is a real eﬀect, but potentially explicable by known physics. Many cross-checks of our
37Ar hypothesis are presented.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There is overwhelming evidence, via astrophysical and
cosmological observations [1, 2], that the Universe is
made of nonluminous matter interacting rarely with
baryons. The search for the aptly-named “dark matter”
has been an active ﬁeld for decades. Experiments have
been looking for diﬀerent types, particularly weakly in-
teracting massive particles (WIMPs) via direct nuclear
recoils (NRs) and/or electronic recoils (ERs). While no
experiment has made an unambiguous conclusive detec-
tion of dark matter or of axions [3] that has not already
been contested and/or explained, the newest results from
the XENON1T experiment [4] do exhibit an excess over
their background for low-energy ER. While XENON1T
was built to look predominantly for WIMPs, it is sensitive
to the axion via ER, particularly solar axions, one poten-
tial explanation for the reported excess. For this work,
we will not study potential solar axion detection, nor a
neutrino magnetic moment or bosonic WIMPs. Instead,
using the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST)
software [5], we focus on independently conﬁrming a real
excess, then seek alternate explanations.

Liquid xenon (LXe) detectors such as XENON1T need
to be simulated with high precision, as in all rare event
searches, before potentially new physics can be properly
identiﬁed. While XENON1T has its own Monte Carlo
(MC) framework [6], whose advantage is in simulating
features unique to the detector, the publicly available
NEST simulation software is a toolkit that is widely
used in the LXe community, and whose development
team includes members of the LUX/LZ, XENON1T/nT,
(n)EXO, and DUNE experiments. NEST has served nu-
merous noble-element-based experiments during the nine
years since its inception [7], proving that it can accurately
simulate and reproduce the results of various LXe (and

liquid argon) detectors [8–11], by incorporating the im-
mense amount of data available from calibrations and
backgrounds (BGs).

II. NOBLE ELEMENT SIMULATION
TECHNIQUE

In a detector-agnostic way, NEST is capable of mod-
eling average yield, i.e., numbers of quanta (photons or
electrons) produced per unit energy, by various types of
interactions: NR, ER, α, 83mKr, and heavy non-Xe ion
recoils like 206Pb [12, 13]. It is also capable of simulating
detector speciﬁcs like energy resolution, both standard
deviation of monoenergetic peaks and the widths of the
log(S2) and log(S2/S1) “bands” (where S1 and S2 refer to
the primary and secondary scintillation signals in noble
elements). NEST can thereby simulate the leakage of ER
events into the NR region and quantify the background
discrimination in WIMP searches. In its simulating both
the mean yields and resolution, NEST is able to model ef-
ﬁciencies, and so thresholds. We heavily take advantage
of this capability in this work. Lastly, NEST can repro-
duce S1 and S2 pulse shape characteristics, but they are
unneeded here except for the S1 coincidence window.

We reanalyze [4] here, utilizing NEST to try and ex-
plain excess events as being, e.g., from an unexpected
BG. NEST average yield and width parameters did not
need to be varied to ﬁt to XENON1T data, as they are
detector-independent. Only the detector-speciﬁc values
were changed to match XENON1T. This is made clear
in Fig. 1. At sub-keV energies, light yield goes to 0, as,
in opposite fashion, charge asymptotes to its maximum
possible value, with NEST uncertainty spanning the pos-
sibilities ranging from taking the inverse of the “tradi-
tional” W value of 13.7
0.2 eV [12] (73 quanta/keV)
to the reciprocal of the recent measurement from EXO,
11.5
0.5 eV (i.e., 87 quanta/keV) [18]. However, in
the region of greatest interest for our analysis, indicated
by vertical dashes in Fig. 1, the default NEST yields MC
simulation for electrons is in outstanding agreement with
all the existing relevant data sets and models. Disagree-

TABLE I. Summary of XENON1T detector parameter values
implemented for NEST in this work. Please note the g1 does
not match a published value, as standard phe units include
the 2-phe eﬀect (whereby one VUV photon can make 2 phe
within a PMT [25]). We therefore quote a diﬀerent g1, in our
style of detector modeling, using the unit of “phd” (detected
photons) developed by LUX [26], with the 2-phe eﬀect sep-
arately simulated, probabilistically (not a constant oﬀset) as
done also by XENON1T. Lastly, in NEST z = 0 (the vertical
axis) is at bottom, requiring a translation from XENON1T’s
deﬁnition, of z = 0 at the top (gate grid wires).

We further assumed a threefold coincidence require-
ment, across 212 active PMTs (Photomultiplier Tubes),
applying a 50.0 ns coincidence window [22]. Based on
all of these inputs, NEST will output a g2 (an emergent
property based on gas light collection, extraction, and
other separate eﬀects modeled from ﬁrst principles [27])
of 9.85 phd/e− (or, 11.57 phe/e−). This can be separated
into an electron extraction eﬃciency of 95%, derived
from PIXeY/LLNL [28, 29], and an underlying SE =
10.37 phd/e− = 12.18 phe/e−. In using Poissonian statis-
tics, we modeled a SE (1σ) width of 3.2 phe/e−. The
pressure and temperature reported lead to a simulated
density of 2.86 g/mL and (e−) drift speed of 1.26 mm/µs,
a velocity which does appear to make the physical coor-
dinates of their reported detector geometry match with
the min and max drift times of the ﬁducial volume. The
density also leads to an expected W = 13.5 eV according
to NEST (which models the work function for creation of
quanta as being dependent on density, including across
phases) which conveniently splits the diﬀerence between
the Dahl and neriX values of 13.4–13.7 eV [30, 31]. This
is a very small eﬀect, however, and an overall scaling of
O(1%). It is therefore a negligible systematic.

FIG. 1. NESTv2.1 Ly (blue), Qy (red) for betas at 81 V/cm.
Bands represent ±10%, a typical estimate of the systematic
uncertainty in NEST, driven primarily by uncertainties in S1
and S2 gains in the data (g1 and g2) [14]. XENON100’s 3H-
based-model is in gray, with XENON1T’s [6] in black using
220Rn at the closest E-ﬁelds with which we can compare, 90
and 82 V/cm, respectively [15]. The circles and diamonds are
80 V/cm 14C and 3H LUX data sets, respectively [16], while
squares are 37Ar data from PIXeY [17] at ∼100 V/cm. One
reason for the slight discrepancy is the Ly increasing (Qy anti-
correlated) with lower drift ﬁeld. Inset: yields out to 5 MeV.

ment at energies orders of magnitude away from this re-
gion of interest (ROI) is less relevant, but also still small
(Fig. 1 inset).

It is therefore no surprise we ﬁnd NEST able to “post-
dict” the XENON1T results at 81 V/cm without any free
parameters. This occurred despite the fact that there is
less calibration data at this low drift ﬁeld (compared to
past experiments operated at O(100–1000) V/cm) upon
which to base NEST’s low-ﬁeld yields model for ER: Ly
(photons/keV) and Qy (e−/keV). So, we were able to use
Fig. 1’s central red and blue lines, without ﬂoating yields.
It is also worth noting that, despite there being a recent
new stable release of NEST, the beta yield model has not
been oﬃcially updated in over two years. Recent LUX
work with a 14C beta source [16] is not the default but
instead a NEST option, to avoid potential overﬁtting to
LUX at the expense of earlier global data. The default
NEST yields applied in this work were ﬁt to LUX tritium
data but not to the LUX 14C data. NEST was never used
for a 220Rn calibration before now, being driven primarily
by tritium, yet it works successfully, as will be seen next.

III. METHODS

The primary method employed here is simple: we ﬁrst
reproduce XENON1T’s calibration data, striving to un-
derstand their energy resolution, detector eﬃciency, and
background model. We simulated data taken under the
conditions of their experiment in NEST, and then com-
pared that output to oﬃcial XENON1T results.

For NEST to accurately and precisely simulate a de-
tector, the ﬁrst key input involves a proper detector pa-
rameter ﬁle. For complete transparency, Table I deﬁnes
all parameters used as input to NEST that can be found
publicly, except for the precise dimensions of the ﬁducial
volume, which were set in NEST to best reproduce the
12 kg. The most important values

A. Energy resolution

We conﬁrmed the veracity of detector parameters and
the ﬂuctuation model, covering both correlated and anti-
correlated noise, by verifying NEST’s predicted resolu-
tion for XENON1T as a function of energy [32] in Fig. 2.
This reveals that the “linear” noise, set by default (unre-
alistically) to 0.0 in NEST is closer to 0.6%. Even with-
out the addition of noise, the energy resolution predicted
by NEST (without free parameters) is in good agreement
with the XENON1T data; this implies that XENON1T
achieved extremely low levels of noise and other eﬀects,
not captured within NEST by default. The diﬀerence is
< 1% (relative) comparing to results with/without noise.
It is modeled as additional, uncorrelated Gaussian smear-
ing and applied separately to the S1 and S2 pulses; it is
directly proportional to each of the pulse areas in phe.

This accounts for imperfect position-dependent light
collection, ﬁeld uniformity, liquid leveling, plus similar
known and unknown eﬀects. Typical linear noise values,
even given high-statistics 83mKr and/or 131mXe calibra-
tions for eﬃciency and ﬁeld mapping, are
1%–4%, with
near-identical values for S1 and S2 (given the same DAQ
being used for all pulse types) whenever NEST is used
to match the past world data from diﬀerent experiments
[30, 33]. We do set the noise to 0.6% here, as it appears
to create a better match to XENON1T, particularly at
lower energies, as shown in Fig. 2. Nevertheless, we have
eﬀectively performed an unbiased side-band calibration
of the noise level here, as the lowest data point within
Fig. 2 is at 41.5 keV, but the solar axion signal model
does not extend beyond 30 keV [4].

B. NEST reproduction of the 220Rn calibration

To further conﬁrm NEST simulates XENON1T well,
we validate it against 220Rn data. We simulate 107 212Pb
beta decays that dominate [36] as well as a ﬂat (i.e., uni-
form in energy) spectrum, as the 212Pb is close to ﬂat.
Figure 3 top compares with both. This demonstrates we
reproduce 220Rn while Fig. 3 second from top potentially
explains outliers in [4] as due to gamma/x-rays, as they
have diﬀerent yields compared with betas at this energy
scale [37]. Our hypothesis can also explain why this type
of event is seen in BG data, but not 3H/14C calibrations
in XENON100/LUX. However, these may be gamma-
X/MSSI (multiple-scatter single-ionization) BGs, possi-
bly more insidious in this higher S1 range up to 70 phe,
as opposed to 20–50 phe in earlier experiments [38]. De-
tector geometry plays a strong role in gamma-X.

The ﬂat ER BG spectrum shows that even in this crude
way we still reproduce XENON1T well. To be quantita-
tive, we compare not the ﬂat MC but Rn MC with data.
(N EST
data)/data (NEST is red in Fig. 3 top) has a
median oﬀset from the data (black line [35]) of –1.0% for
band mean, with (nonsystematic) max/min deviation of
5%. For band width, the median oﬀset is +1.3% with
±
max/min
12%. This is quite comparable to what can
be achieved with NEST with direct access to data [27].

ergies in black [34]. NEST with 0.006 noise is the cyan dash,
extending the same simulations from the primary ﬁgure. Once
g1, g2, and E-ﬁeld are established, they drive the resolution in
this energy range, from ﬁrst principles. Data sets from other
experiments are displayed as points, in other colors, but are
not expected to match as resolution is unique per experiment.
The yellow square in the inset will be addressed later.

C. XENON1T ER background NEST generator

Of equal importance to reproduction of the 220Rn cali-
bration is BG generation, for obtaining simulated points:
orange, in lower half of Fig. 3, contrasted with ﬂat in
cyan and data in black. A custom generator was created
to follow the XENON1T ER BG model, corrected for de-
tection eﬃciency, below 30 keV, allowing for a signiﬁcant
buﬀer beyond the excess ROI. By not including detec-
tor eﬃciency initially, we ensure the generator inputs the
“true energies” into NEST, as an unadulterated, uncor-
rected energy spectrum, independent of detector eﬀects.
NEST’s PDF is the sum of all XENON1T BGs in Ta-
ble 1 of [4], which includes the mean rate for each iso-
tope ﬁt by XENON1T, and the energy spectrum shapes
assumed. Our check of the excess remains independent,
as the use of NEST instead of XENON1T MC leads to
some variations in energy resolutions, as seen in Fig. 2
and next in Fig. 4 where the 163.9 keV peak (131mXe)
diﬀers slightly. The sum of all BGs is indistinguishable
statistically (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, quoted be-
low) from ﬂat due to ﬂuctuations, prior to addition of
37Ar. See Fig. 3 for scatter, Fig. 5 for energy binning.

In Fig. 4, we explicitly show what the XENON1T BG
looks like before eﬃciency. It is quite ﬂat for
4–30 keV,
but has a slight positive slope, after all radioisotopes are
combined that contribute, which we do not neglect. Com-
puting this was a necessary initial step. This is not in [4]
but was derived by combining all isotopic contributions
and dividing by the eﬃciency. The resultant shape bet-

FIG. 4. Smooth depiction of BGs assumed by NEST in blue
(long dash), compared to B0 in red (solid), and observed data
in black (points with errors) [4]. The exponential is in green
(dotted) that best ﬁts the excess (no 37Ar necessary). Given
uncertainties, including systematics in B0 and in eﬃciency,
not depicted, it might be possible to reconcile the blue with
the green. Figure 6 implies that is not necessarily the case,
but a combination may be possible where the number of neces-
sary 37Ar events to explain the data is dropped, reducing the
steepness required in the green to explain the excess. (Note
green becomes pink and blue becomes orange in other plots.)

ter motivates qualitatively our investigation later into a
BG that rises as energy goes to zero.

To show our generator functions, we simulate BG with
it, and compare the outputs to data along with our ﬁrst
simpliﬁed ﬂat model once again. 1-D unbinned KS tests
in both S1s and S2s, running the generator repeatedly
with diﬀerent seeds on diﬀerent systems and with diﬀer-
ent events counts (both greater than and equal to the
409 real points) produced p-values of 0.1–0.3 with both
models, without a consistent improvement when apply-
ing noise, as small pulse areas are less aﬀected by it.

These p-values are not indicative of any signiﬁcant de-
gree of statistical inconsistency. The reason they are not
uniformly distributed up to 1.0 is likely the divergence at
the lower half of the band for the lowest S1s, most easily
observed in Fig. 3 (top). This issue is not challenging to
understand, but diﬃcult to model without access to all
information on XENON1T. It is likely due to a combina-
tion of wall and accidental-coincidence BGs that are not
included in NEST. This feature can be observed in both
[4] and Fig. 16 of [35]. Looking at the low-S1 upper half of
the band, it is clear this is a problem with the symmetry
of the band, but not with band width overall. Alphas on
the wall or from 220Rn itself degraded in energy, as well
as heavy recoiling atoms/ions such as Pb from the Rn
chain and naked betas, may experience charge loss, low-
ering the S2. As this is a problem only at lower S2s, and
appears below the average S1 for 37Ar, our results stand
in spite of this, but this is a problem even in the ﬁducial
volume far from the walls: degraded position resolution
at walls can cause a low S2 to be reconstructed inside of
the ﬁducial volume. For higher S2s, apparent leakage of
events above the upper Gaussian contour can be ascribed
to multiple-scatter ER identiﬁed as single-scatter and/or
Xe-intrinsic upward skew, as detailed later for peaks.

220Rn calibration superimposed in solid black [35], with skew-
Gaussian ﬁts, compared to ﬂat BG (dashed cyan). Points for
black not provided but can be seen in [35]. Contours indicate

curves near 1 keV in Fig. 5 is due to NEST’s lower in-
trinsic eﬃciency, as predicted based on g1, g2, and ﬁeld,
but this (insigniﬁcant) disagreement is far from the ROI.
However, 37Ar does fall well within the ROI and, based
also on LUX experiences [39, 40], is our primary attempt
to explain the excess. We at ﬁrst added 50 37Ar events
over the full 0.65 tonne-year exposure, estimated from
the raw size of the excess, later reﬁned to 31
11 counts
37Ar exhibits two low-E peaks: 0.27 and
as best ﬁt.
2.82 keV. While the latter is the one of interest here, as
it may lie near the location of the excess in XENON1T’s
main analysis, the lower-E peak may permit us to distin-
guish between 37Ar and other potential BGs. Our MC
simulation corresponds to 48 +17
37Ar decays per tonne-
18
year of exposure. Fig. 3 bottom shows them in S2 vs. S1.
We also model an exponential background added to a
ﬂat ER background (pink in Fig. 5). However, it is not
motivated by a speciﬁc new BG physically. It is purely
mathematical, but shows that adding either a spectrum,
or a monoenergetic peak, can reproduce the excess. As
the ﬂat + exponential model ﬁts so well, we try to moti-
vate the excess by an underestimation in the BG model,
via an overestimation of eﬃciency. However, we ﬁnd the
eﬃciency would have to be over 2σ oﬀ for several data
points in a row, in the ROI, to justify such a drastically
diﬀerent BG, as shown in Fig. 6. This is less compelling.
Lastly, we model tritium (3H), but also ﬁnd it to be
less compelling. It is not only a worse ﬁt than 37Ar and
the exponential (if you account for shape using χ2, and
do not just look at Poisson statistics), it is lower than
the other hypotheses in the 2.5 keV bin, farther from
the data. It also raises the counts in the lowest energy
bin due to this being a continuous source, unlike 37Ar
which is monoenergetic. The exponential hypothesis suf-
fers less from this raising of counts for the 1.5 keV bin
considerably above the data, as, counterintuitively, expo-
nentially more counts at low energies implies more counts
at true energies which are unable to ﬂuctuate up eﬀec-
tively, in reconstructed energy space. We fully recognize
these statements could be strengthened with a PLR, but
without access to all data in all dimensions including po-
sition this is unrealistic for non-XENON1T members.

in the same colors as at top, but after realistic full, detector
MC. For clarity, every point has been oﬀset from its actual
value by O(0.1) keV and 3H is omitted. The ﬂat BG is 66 per
tonne-year-keV. Random seed used is identical per each row.

D. Energy reconstruction and eﬃciency

The excess was measured in binned energy space not S2
versus S1 scatter, so that deﬁned the next investigation.
XENON1T reports reconstructed energies, but the non-
linear deconvolution into true energy was estimated via
MC [6, 35] for their PLR. There may be diﬀerences from
NEST, but primarily at sub-keV, thus irrelevant.

The eﬃciency was veriﬁed many ways, but again NEST
agrees with what was reported except sub-keV, not rele-
vant here, and also within large errors (in the Appendix).

IV. RESULTS

The NEST-simulated energy histograms are depicted
in Fig. 5. The top only shows the region of interest below
10 keV but we explored up to 30 keV as shown at bottom.
Black circles are always real data points as reported by
[4]. We ﬁrst modeled XENON1T’s ER background using
NEST, assuming a ﬂat background (cyan squares), then
using our custom generator (orange diamonds again).

the 2–4 keV range where the excess seems largest). The num-
ber of free parameters assumed for B0 and the PDF, our cus-
tom B0-like generator, is four, representing the four largest
low-energy BGs (214Pb, 85Kr, solar ν’s, materials) and three
for the exponential (amplitude, shape, oﬀset). With 3H and
37Ar, one additional parameter was varied for the PDF, the
number of decays. Flat had only one free parameter. Us-
ing na¨ıve counting, in a tighter energy window, all excess
hypotheses do well, as denoted by σp (p = Poisson). σχ is
derived from the χ2/d.o.f (degrees of freedom).

Table II has the χ2’s and the σ discrepancies between
our models and the data points (black dots from Fig. 5).
For completeness, and to reproduce the XENON1T num-
bers, we considered the 1–7 keV range. However, due to
the size of the error bars, we ﬁnd that the ﬁts, and thus
χ2’s, are overconstrained over this range. Therefore, we
choose to ﬁt to a larger energy range (1–30 keV, as per
Fig. 4 of [4]). This shows that our best ﬁt to the data is
using an exponential BG, followed by 37Ar then tritium.
37Ar does not span 1.5–3.5 keV bins equally, when at
2.8 keV it should be
symmetric about 2.5 keV. This is
due to positive skew (Fig. 7). At near-threshold energies,
event triggering occurs on high-S1 tails. Moreover, skew
in NEST enters at the level of recombination probability
for S2 electrons, derived from LUX calibrations [41]. It
appears not only in ER bands but monoenergetic peaks.

for preliminary XENON1T calibration data. The skew-
ness eﬀect, already observed for 37Ar [17, 42], is again
not speciﬁc to it [41]; the eﬀect will be more prominent
for monoenergetic peaks than for a broad spectrum of
diﬀerent energies like tritium, due to smearing.

In Fig. 7 bottom, we use NEST to further study ac-
tual 37Ar, which was a XENON1T calibration, not just
potential BG or excess hypothesis, aﬀording us an op-
portunity of a deeper independent study. For this plot,
we separate combined energy into the S1 and S2 areas.
The non-Gaussian, triangular shape qualitatively agrees
with data. This should make the probability of a NEST
mismodeling of 37Ar in XENON1T impacting our result
de minimis. To allow additional, quantitative compari-
son, in combined-energy space, we quantify our work in
Fig. 7 top.

A similar asymmetry was in fact already reported by
XENON1T: after discovering low outliers, lying below
their ER band (Sec. III B: possibly γ’s and/or γ-X),

not just high outliers above the band (as expected based
upon the skew observed in their calibration bands), they
added a BG “mismodeling” parameter into their WIMP
search to compensate for any lower (i.e., subband) out-
liers [24, 43]. They did ultimately determine though that
fewer WIMP-signal-like (NR-like) ER tail events in sci-
ence data compared to calibration were a better ﬁt [6, 21]
and also provided an explanation for remaining outliers
as being driven primarily by surface BGs, which experi-
ence charge loss, lowering their S2, similar to what was
found on LUX [44], and mentioned earlier. We presented
here a novel explanation that can perhaps account for a
fraction of the outliers in Fig. 3 (XENON1T’s Fig. 5).
Further evidence in favor of gammas is in the Appendix.
They are not likely to explain all outliers as the NR band
would be too contaminated for a WIMP search then.

Another important check upon the validity of the 37Ar
hypothesis comes from looking at the S2-only analysis.
Note that this will be in units of the total S2 signal,
as opposed to bottom-PMT-array, and it is uncorrected,

disagreement from χ2-based, not PLR, ﬁts to the data, with
NEST. The nature of the diﬀerent statistical test causes the
nonsmooth V shape, and lower signiﬁcances of discrepancy
in the “wings,” as expected for this type of method. Despite
these diﬀerences, we ﬁnd a near-identical best-ﬁt energy as
XENON1T, with 2.82 keV discrepant by a similar amount:
> 3σ at least. In purple, the ﬁt function is changed to a skew
Gaussian, lowering the disagreement to 0.6σ and bringing the
best ﬁt closer (higher E). This too is natural, as the sim-
ulation showed positive skew, quantitatively conﬁrmed with
data, and a greater number of free parameters introduces new
correlations.

Where A is amplitude, µ mean, ω related to σ (i.e.,

peak, or median, for positive and negative skew, respec-
tively. We scan over both normal Gaussian ﬁts (in gold)
and skew versions (in purple) in the data in our Fig. 5
(XENON1T’s Fig. 4), conducting a monoenergetic peak
search. The results are depicted in Fig. 9. For the Gaus-
sian case, we reproduce XENON1T’s 2.3 keV value, with
a similar error bar, further evidence they ﬁt to a Gaus-
sian, but in the skew case we ﬁnd a higher best-ﬁt mean,
2.5 keV, within a greater error range, spanning 2.3 and
2.8 keV. Contrasting the two methods, one can see that
proper accounting of skew can easily shift 2.3 to 2.8 keV.
Our 37Ar hypothesis should therefore still be seriously
considered. A PLR would likely have a more constrain-
ing uncertainty. Lastly, many phenomenological papers
reinterpreting the excess [45–49] infer a 2.8 keV peak in
independent analyses completely unrelated to NEST, or
skew. This is additional evidence 2.8 is not unreasonable.
Recognizing [4] states 37Ar is unlikely, we sought addi-
tional validation beyond mean energy and S2-only. First,
we refer back to Fig. 2 inset, which shows NEST’s width

FIG. 8. S2-only data from NEST (gold) simulated by adding
the same amount of 37Ar as in the primary analysis to the
preliminary XENON1T S2-only BG model [19] (black steps).
Excess over BG at ∼2000 phe (or photoelectrons (PE)) is
consistent with 2.82 keV in NEST, consistent with the pre-
liminary XENON1T data points [19] (black dots). Errors on
y are Poisson; on x, bin width. Lastly, while a na¨ıve scaling
(0.27/2.8) * 1900 = 180 would reproduce the ﬁrst bin excess,
the energy dependence of Qy does not justify that.

as the lack of S1 makes 3D position correction impossi-
ble. If the excess is due to 37Ar, then we expect addi-
tional excess at low S2s due to the 0.27 keV peak from
the 37Ar, along with more events at high S2s due to the
2.82 keV peak. Our NEST simulation is compared to the
XENON1T S2-only cross-check [19] and it is shown in
Fig. 8. Within the statistics of the existing data provided
by XENON1T, the S2-only analysis can neither rule out,
nor rule in, the 37Ar hypothesis. It is not, however, in-
consistent with it and can thus be the means to explain
the excess event counts with respect to the S2-only BG
model in most bins, even if they are not individually sta-
tistically signiﬁcant.

The comparison at the lowest energy bins is less com-
pelling, with the excess over BG occurring at lower S2
than simulated with NEST at 0.27 keV with the proper
branching ratio. However, Fig. 1 hints this could be
explained within NEST’s large uncertainties on Qy for
this extreme low-energy regime. Furthermore, as this is
uncorrected S2, we would need a full XY map and e−–
lifetime (vs. time) to simulate XENON1T more precisely.
Lastly, few-e− BGs from multiple sources, e.g., grid wire
emissions [11], may be coming into play for the ﬁrst bin.
Because of these enormous systematics, we do not pursue
the S2-only avenue further, not considering, e.g., tritium.
A drawback to the 37Ar hypothesis is the best ﬁt to
a peak for a bosonic dark matter search being 2.3 keV:
in XENON1T’s Fig. 11 ([4] v2) 2.8 keV is strongly disfa-
vored. We now reconcile our hypothesis with this analy-
sis. XENON1T states more than once that the functional
form used in [4] was Gaussian, so their peak search does
not account for the inherent asymmetry due to skew at
keV-scale energies (Fig. 7 again) demonstrated by their
own calibration, which they do not include in their anal-

(15.79% at 2.8 keV) in cyan, better matching the digi-
tized XENON1T 37Ar calibration data width (15.88%)
in yellow, compared with the XENON1T model (18.88%
at 2.8 keV) in black, implying a possible discrepancy in
energy resolution. [46], an independent reanalysis of the
XENON1T data, agrees with the lower resolution pre-
dicted by NEST. The XENON1T analysis [19] states that
the 37Ar calibration data show a resolution of 18.12%;
however, both NEST and our digitization of the real data
agree upon 16% rounded across 3 methods (Gauss, skew,
raw σ). Our only explanation is a ﬁt to only the right half
of the peak yields 18.1%, but this just underscores again
our point that skew or asymmetry cannot be ignored.

Next, we considered time dependence in actual data in
Fig. 10. While errors are large and XENON1T’s PLR has
already established the points are consistent with none,
we ﬁnd in Fig. 10 statistical consistency with the 37Ar
lifetime. While our hypothesis tests are “goodness of ﬁt”
not likelihood ratios, multiple tests all concur, despite
distillation and gettering removing Ar in principle [4].
The unlikely possibility exists that, e.g., a small leak,
outgassing, or activation introduces minute quantities of
it, or it is introduced by other means as-yet not under-
stood. This could address why the excess was present in
both of the two XENON1T science runs [4]. This lifetime
consistency implies an introduction mechanism occurring
only at the beginning of runs. While we cannot explain
conclusively why XENON1T would have 31 37Ar events,
we note LUX observed excess events at an energy con-
sistent with 37Ar.
If the LUX peak was new physics,
XENON1T would have observed 200-500 events, based
on the exposure increase between LUX and XENON1T,
not 30 [40]. This discrepancy cannot be accounted for
by diﬀerent eﬃciencies, since they were similar for both
100% at 2.8 keV for ER).

V. DISCUSSION

The excess seen by XENON1T can be eﬀectively repro-
duced by NEST, and second it may be caused by known
physics, other than tritium or other sources already con-
sidered [50]. On incorporation of 37Ar into the BG model,
disagreement between model and data is 2.2σ (0.4σ Pois-
sonian). This is not completely comparable to PLR, but
uses χ2, like [50], but it might be possible to show even
better agreement if we were to fully consider every un-
certainty in NEST; we conservatively do not, relying on
the default beta yields model.

There is uncertainty for the newly modeled skew [41].
Advantage is never taken of this, using again the cen-
tral NEST values only based on LUX/ZEPLIN [41, 51].
Higher skew, within error, could easily not only add more
points at higher S2 in the ﬁrst few S1 bins of Fig. 3 but
also add more counts into the 3.5 and 4.5 keV bins and
make 37Ar as good if not a better ﬁt to the XENON1T
ER data, when compared again to the less well-motivated
(from physics) exponential. That latter notion can itself
still be motivated, based on past claims of new physics
evidence [52] which may be explicable with exponential

FIG. 10. The time dependence of preliminary XENON1T sci-
ence data [19] in black. Without the time variation (ﬂat black
line), we ﬁnd p = 0.7, matching the p of the XENON1T PLR,
in spite of using χ2-testing instead, showing the similarity of
our analysis. We then introduce 31 ± 11 37Ar decays (yellow
lines), as determined from ﬁtting the excess in energy space,
with no free parameters, then ﬂoat the lifetime, counts, and
both. The χ2/d.o.f for all scenarios is < 1.0; all hypothe-
ses have corresponding p-values of ∼0.9. While this does not
conﬁrm 37Ar, it certainly does not rule it out either. More-
over, when the decay count is kept ﬁxed at 31 37Ar events,
the best-ﬁt mean (1/e) lifetime is 50 +40
−30 days. When both
the lifetime and counts are allowed to ﬂoat free, the best ﬁt
is 57 ± 31 events, and 36 ± 21 days. 37Ar’s actual lifetime is
50.6 days (half-life 35.04 d [53]). While errors on lifetime are
large, multiple ﬁt versions agreeing at 1σ is a positive hint
and shows once more 37Ar is worth investigating thoroughly.

(or similar: power-law) rising backgrounds at low energy,
across diﬀerent technologies. We do not speculate on any
speciﬁc physics to explain it in LXe.

Eﬃciency and energy reconstruction may contribute to
systematics, but primarily at sub-keV; thus, these can-
not impact the excess and overall XENON1T result. We
acknowledge we had no access to actual XENON1T data
and thus had to digitize their plots for comparisons. This
can lead to a small error; although, NEST is incredibly
robust in its predictions as depicted in the past, and we
have put in a system of checks to try to minimize our er-
rors. Therefore, the authors do not believe these would
impact our reported results signiﬁcantly. That said, and
as mentioned before, NEST is an open-source software.
We urge the XENON1T Collaboration to reproduce our
work using their data and/or make their data available
publicly. While the results presented here stop short of
using PLR, such an analysis for the NEST results will
yield more robust conclusions. Although, once more, it
is unlikely to change the fact that to ﬁrst order we have
independently reproduced the XENON1T excess and ﬁnd
it consistent with 37Ar. We do not claim to know how it
could be introduced, but note such an unexplained excess
was previously found in LUX [40].

Other possible future work could include redoing the
entire analysis using the EXO-200 reported value W =
11.5 eV, though this would be highly nontrivial: simple
rescaling of g1 and g2 to account for this W would disrupt
NEST agreement with data on the carefully crafted ﬂuc-
tuations model (Fano factor for total quanta, excitation

and ionization, and nonbinomial recombination ﬂuctu-
ations). Evidence in favor of our present assumptions
ultimately lies in reproduction of XENON1T’s data.

APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL VALIDATIONS

∼

This Appendix is secondary evidence to corroborate
several of our conclusions. First, we show that the photo-
absorption process is capable of reducing the charge yield
by
half (NEST actually assumes a smaller diﬀerence)
compared to Compton scattering. The 2.8 keV 37Ar peak
is the result of e− capture, so it was not immediately clear
which of the two ER models was most appropriate, his-
torically named gamma (photoabsorption would be bet-
ter) and beta models, even though later data showed that
betas agree with Compton scatters within uncertainties,
in terms of yield measurements [16, 31].

±

We base our claim of a diﬀerence primarily on [54]. In
the main text body, this is referred to as the diﬀerence
between the nominal gamma/x-ray NEST model as op-
posed to the beta model which covers Compton as well.
Ly data were converted into Qy (even at 0 V/cm) by
assuming anticorrelation holds (total of 73 quanta/keV).
See Fig. 11. Relative yields were converted into absolute
numbers of photons per keV to high precision by con-
verting between 32.1 keV (83mKr) and 122 keV (57Co)
yields, which are nearly identical [55], and then assuming
2 photons/keV at 0 V/cm for 57Co γ-rays, a well-
63
established value, given the historic role of this source in
calibrating LXe detectors [12]. While many intermediate
steps appear in this analysis, each is robustly justiﬁable.
If one reconsiders Fig. 1, diﬀerent E-ﬁelds may be in-
suﬃcient to completely explain at least 1σ of diﬀerence
between the 37Ar PIXeY data [17] and NEST. Recent
work by XELDA [57] indicates that there may be 5–10%
diﬀerences in yield at diﬀerent energies and ﬁelds, not
only between gammas and betas but among many diﬀer-
ent ER subtypes. The PIXeY data set most especially
works in our favor here: if we increased the charge yield
at 2.82 keV, it could better explain the excess observed in
S2, at low S1s, in the data scatter plot of Fig. 3 (around
S1 of 7, S2 just below 2000 phe). This might further help
explain reconstruction of 2.8 keV as 2.5 or as low as 2.3.

1. XENON1T’s energy reconstruction

As the excess was measured for the energy space his-
togram not in S2 versus S1 scatter, we also explored the

FIG. 11. Comparison of NEST gamma (dash) and beta (solid)
models below 30 keV, for 81 V/cm ﬁeld. The light yield is in
blue and charge yield in red. The inset depicts NEST’s ratio
of charge yields in red dash, along with a comparison to data,
dividing the x-ray results of Ospanov and Obodovskii [56] by
the Compton scatters from Baudis et al., which also cites the
former. Both data sets are from zero ﬁeld, which is why NEST
does not agree well with the data points despite being partly
based on them. Direct evidence of the ratio at 81 V/cm does
not exist. That being said, NEST is constrained by lower (0)
and higher ﬁelds; its γ model is extrapolated at nonzero ﬁeld
from high energy. This plot supplements Figs. 1 and 3, green.

energy reconstruction. While the combined-energy scale
outperforms the older S1-only [58] or ionization-only em-
ployed, e.g., by ν projects [59], it is prone to breakdown at
low energy. XENON1T reports reconstructed energy, not
true energy that they estimated via MC [6, 35]. Figure 12
shows the output from the NEST reconstructed energy,
which diﬀers drastically from the true energy especially
in the sub-keV regime, in agreement with neriX [31].

While important for other analyses, and although it
can create diﬀerences of a factor of 2, the discrepancy is
not relevant here. It is only particularly evident <1 keV,
outside the region of interest for XENON1T’s excess.

2. Detection eﬃciency

All of the techniques for estimating detector eﬃciency
ultimately agree on high eﬃciencies at 2–4 keV, of rele-
vance to the excess. Despite not accounting for detector
speciﬁcs such as unique S1 pulse shapes [35], comparing
NEST with data (Rn to Rn, red to black in Fig. 13), the
reduced χ2 = 1.4 below 5 keV and 1.6 for 1–5 keV. These
were calculated with systematics in both the data (Fig. 2
in [4]) and in NEST (diﬀerence among red, cyan, green in
Fig. 13). This points to NEST’s robustness in modeling
eﬃciency, even at energies of only a few keV.

Speciﬁcally, ER detection eﬃciency was veriﬁed in four
ways: true energy for the x-axis (dark blue line), NEST
reconstructed energy (green line) which should match the
default XENON1T method (mustard line), simulating a
ﬂat energy spectrum (light blue, i.e., “cyan” points), and
utilizing the 220Rn beta spectrum (red points), with the
latter two but especially red meant to match black. The
last three methods all use reconstructed energy, but diﬀer
in energy spectrum. Both mustard and black come from

10

FIG. 12. NEST output comparing true to reconstructed en-
ergy, using XENON1T parameters. The thickness of the line
indicates statistical uncertainty. The disagreement is an emer-
gent property stemming from many causes, including inherent
skew in recombination probability, and triggering on upward
ﬂuctuations instead of true mean S1 and S2 pulse sizes, near
thresholds (the Eddington bias [60]). Inset: neriX data [31],
included for qualitative comparison only, as direct agreement
would only be seen by modeling the neriX detector in NEST.

XENON1T: the former is their MC estimate and latter
their Rn cross-check. NEST cases are compared to them.
Fig. 13 demonstrates a good level of agreement among
NEST’s four scenarios, with the most signiﬁcant compar-
isons being red and cyan against black, and green against
mustard. Below 1 keV, mistaking the reconstructed en-
ergy for true (blue) may cause an overestimation of ef-
ﬁciency but this is challenging to conclude with great
certainty given the large error bars including systemat-
ics. One of these systematics is the possibility that the
ER light yield is higher than in NEST near 1 keV and
lower energies, closer to what was assumed by XENON1T
(Fig. 1) or in earlier NEST versions before sub-keV Qy’s
were published (driving Ly estimates downward via anti-
correlation). This could easily raise all NEST points and
curves up to the mustard in the inset at the very lowest
energies. While not directly relevant to the main point of
this paper to explain the XENON1T excess since not in
the
2–4 keV ROI or higher, we nonetheless continue to
brieﬂy discuss the region below 1 keV in this Appendix,
as it may be of interest to the broader community.

∼

∼

The mustard line is above the black points for the ﬁrst
four bins in a row for the inset. However, the diﬀerences
are always at
1–2σ. What we claim to be the eﬃciency
vs. true energy in (dark) blue is sometimes lower, some-
times higher, than the 220Rn points, but diverges from
mustard as energy goes to zero. A continuous spectrum
such as 220Rn is not best for determining eﬃciency, even
though this was one LUX method [61] (though not for a
potential signal). 220Rn was only the cross-check though
for XENON1T. Alternatively, a dense series of monoen-
ergetic MC peaks, as naturally done with NEST, can be
tuned and veriﬁed to match a particular detector’s data

FIG. 13. The dependence of the relative eﬃciency on the en-
ergy. The mustard is XENON1T’s eﬃciency model and black
is data, both from [4], the latter using the 220Rn calibration,
which we reproduce using NEST: ﬁrst with a ﬂat beta model
(cyan) and then with the correct 220Rn energy spectrum (red).
Red and cyan each follow black well: this provides further evi-
dence we can replicate XENON1T’s analyses. Green is NEST
eﬃciency versus the reconstructed energy from an analytical
ﬁt (Gompertz) to a series of monoenergetic sims. Blue is ver-
sus true energy. Inset: zoom-out for larger range, log axes.
An overall (∼ﬂat) reduction in eﬃciency across all energy is
not portrayed, to focus on shape (actual asymptote < 1).

set, as performed for NRs for LUX [26]. This should ex-
plain the diﬀerence between the green and mustard if the
latter does not originate from a series of monoenergetic
peaks. Much contamination between energy bins occurs
due to ﬁnite resolution in continuous real data [62] that
is of course changing rapidly versus energy, with resolu-
tion becoming poorer as energy decreases (Fig. 2). If one
prefers to study eﬃciency as a function of reconstructed
energy with MC peaks instead of true, both mustard and
black may be too high, above green. It is acceptable for
black to disagree with green as 220Rn in black (in data)
comes from a particular energy spectrum, but mustard
and green should agree. Some diﬀerence in method and in
Ly have already been listed as the possible explanation.
Individual PMT eﬀects are another possibility: diﬀering
QEs and 2-PE probabilities by PMT across the detector,
and XYZ-dependent photon collection. Additionally, the
exact S1 pulse shape and area-dependent eﬃciency for
detection of single-PE and/or few-PE pulses for the ex-
treme energies, especially given XENON’s uniquely long-
tailed S1 pulses, with ringing, may be relevant.

Lastly, the green curve, the NEST eﬃciency versus re-
constructed energy for XENON1T, does not agree bet-
ter with the light blue (cyan) nor red points, also from
NEST and also versus reconstructed energy, because it
comes from the series of monoenergetic peaks, the results
from which are eﬀectively splined together, while red and
cyan are inﬂuenced by cross-contamination between en-
ergy bins as mentioned earlier, from energies both higher
and lower than the central value of a particular bin. The
reason that red and cyan are not even self-consistent is
the diﬀerence in energy spectrum (Rn versus ﬂat). Rn is
no longer approximately ﬂat in energy near 1 keV.
