Abstract. We investigate, from a theoretical perspective, photo-emission of electrons
induced by ultra-short infrared pulses covering only a few photon cycles. In particular,
we investigate the impact of the Carrier-Envelope Phase (CEP) of the laser pulse which
plays an increasingly large role for decreasing pulse length. As key observable we look at
the asymmetry of the angular distribution as function of kinetic energy of the emitted
electrons. The focus of the present study lies on the system dependence of the reaction.
To this end, we study two very diﬀerent systems in comparison, an Ar atom and the
Na+
9 cluster. The study employs a fully quantum-mechanical description of electron
dynamics at the level of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT). We
ﬁnd a sensitive dependence on the system which can be related to the diﬀerent spectral
response properties. Results can be understood from an interplay of the ponderomotive
motion driven by the external photon ﬁeld and dynamical polarization of the system.

1. Introduction

The enormous progress in laser technology has meanwhile reached the regime of
extremely short pulses which cover only a few optical cycles [1, 2]. This opens the door
to a great variety of new investigations such as time-resolved measurement of electronic
processes or precision control of chemical reactions see, e.g., [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. One of
the main new aspects of such few-cycle pulses is that the Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP),
i.e. the relative phase between the optical carrier wave and the pulse envelope, acquires
a sensitive inﬂuence on the pulse shape which, in turn, can have a strong impact on all
laser induced reactions [10, 11, 12]. This looks at ﬁrst glance as a complication because
there is one more laser parameter to be taken care of. But it can be turned into an
advantage by potentially controlling electronic reactions with dedicated variations of

the CEP. A particularly interesting example is found in photo-electron emission where
the CEP allows to control the forward-backward (also called “right-left”) asymmetry
in the photo-electron spectra (PES) [13, 14]. Theoretical calculations have shown that
the (high energy) parts of PES coming from electron recollisions are more sensitive to
CEP than the (low energy) parts from directly emitted electrons [15, 12, 16, 17, 18].
Experimentally, the dependence of high-energy PES on the CEP has been explored for
atoms [13, 19, 20], dimer molecules [21], and nano-tips [22, 23], providing challenging
motivations for the theoretical investigations.

In a recent work, the Angular-Resolved PES (ARPES) of C60 were calculated as
a function of the Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) using a fully quantum-mechanical
approach based on Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) and looking
in particular at the asymmetry of the angular distribution for diﬀerent kinetic energies
of the emitted electrons [24]. These theoretical simulations allowed to reproduce the
experimentally found dependencies on laser parameters, particularly on pulse length
and CEP. The next question which comes up naturally is to which extend the results
depend on the system which is irradiated. To answer this question, we have extended
the previous calculations to include diﬀerent atomic systems, notably atomic Argon and
Na+
9 clusters. These systems were chosen, since they have about the same complexity (8
active electrons) but diﬀer drastically in their electronic response: the photo-excitation
spectrum of Ar has a discrete peak at about 15 eV followed by a widespread shoulder
above while the spectrum of Na+
9 is dominated by a strong surface plasmon resonance
at about 2.7 eV. It is obvious that an infrared (IR) laser is far closer to resonance for
Na+
9 and this should have consequences. To investigate this in detail is the aim of the
present work.

The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we brieﬂy review the theoretical

framework. In section 3, we present and discuss the results.

We describe the electronic dynamics by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory
the Time-Dependent Local Density Approximation
(TDDFT) at
(TDLDA) [25] using the exchange-correlation functional from [26]. For an appropriate
modeling of electron emission, we augment the TDLDA by a Self-Interaction Correction
(SIC) [27]. As a full SIC treatment is computationally very demanding, [28], we use it in
a simpliﬁed, but reliable and eﬃcient version as an Average Density SIC (ADSIC) [29].
The ADSIC is able to put the single-particle energies into the correct relation to the
continuum threshold such that the ionization potential (IP) is properly reproduced in a
great variety of systems [30]. A correct description of the IP is particularly important for
the analysis of photoemission, the more so in connection with strong IR ﬁelds because
here electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbitals dominate [31].

The ionic background is described by soft local pseudopotentials,

Here, E0 denotes the peak electric ﬁeld, ωlas the carrier frequency, and Tpulse the total
pulse duration. The CEP is comprised in the parameter φCEP which deﬁnes the phase
between a maximum of oscillations with frequency ωlas and the maximum of the cos2
envelope. The minus sign in the deﬁnition of the potential guarantees that the driving
force of the electrical ﬁeld points in forward direction (positive z) for positive ﬁeld
E(t). In what follows, we use laser parameters close to those in recent experiments [34]:
frequency ωlas = 1.72 eV (a wavelength of 720 nm), intensity I = 6 × 1013 W/cm2,
corresponding to ﬁeld amplitude E0 = 1.1 eV/a0, and total duration Tpulse=4 fs, 6 fs,
and 8 fs, corresponding to 1.7, 2.5, and 3.3 optical cycles (1 optical cycle /tauIR =
2.4 fs). Note that these laser parameters are associated with a ponderomotive energy
Up = 2.9 eV. Figure 1 illustrates the temporal part of the laser ﬁeld ∝ E(t) for the
three Tpulse under consideration, each one for the CEP at 0◦ and 90◦. For φCEP = 0◦,
the center of the envelope (dashes) coincides with a maximum of the oscillations, while
for φCEP = 90◦, it is shifted to match with the nodal points of the electric ﬁeld. Clearly,
we see a substantial change of the electric ﬁeld due to the diﬀerent CEP in each case.

2.1. Numerical details

The TDLDA-ADSIC equations are solved numerically on a cylindrical grid in coordinate
space [35]. The static iterations towards the electronic ground state are done with
the damped gradient method [36] and the time evolution employs the time-splitting
technique [37]. For details of the numerical method see [38, 39, 40]. We use a numerical
box which extends to ±250 a0 in z direction (along the laser polarization) and 250 a0
orthogonal to it (radial r coordinate), with a grid spacing of 0.5 a0 in both directions.
Time propagation is followed up to after 44 fs with a small time step of 1–5 attoseconds.
Box size and time span are suﬃciently large to track completely the rescattering of
electrons in the laser ﬁeld (ponderomotive motion). To account for ionization, absorbing
boundary conditions are implemented using a mask function [41]. The absorbing margin
extends over 32 a0 at each side of the grid.

The central observable of electron emission in our analysis is the Angle-Resolved
Photo-Electron Spectrum (ARPES), i.e., the yield of emitted electrons [Y(Ekin, θ)] as
function of kinetic energy Ekin and emission angle θ. We calculate an ARPES by
recording at each time step the single-electron wave functions {ψj(t, rM), j = 1, . . . , Nel}
at selected measuring points rM near the absorbing layer and ﬁnally transforming this
information from time- to frequency-domain, see [42, 43, 44, 45]. Finally, the ARPES
is written as

Y(Ekin, θ) ∝

Nel(cid:88)

j=1

|(cid:102)ψj(Ekin, rM)|2

(2)

where (cid:102)ψj are the transformed wave functions in energy domain.
In case of strong
ﬁelds, as we encounter here, the (cid:102)ψj are augmented by a phase factor accounting for the
ponderomotive motion, for technical details see [44]. The angle θ is deﬁned with respect
to ez, i.e. θ = 0◦ means electronic emission in the direction of ez. A detailed ARPES
analysis requires a ﬁne resolution for Fourier transformation and emission angles. To
that end, we use an increment of 0.04 eV in energy and 1◦ opening angle for the angular
bins.

It is cumbersome and confusing to check the full ARPES for all variations of laser
parameters. It turns out that a key feature is the asymmetry of the angular distribution

3. Results

3.1. Introductory example

For a ﬁrst comparison of systems, we chose the integrated asymmetry Eq. (4) versus
CEP as simple signal. Results for three diﬀerent systems are compared in ﬁgure 2:
the C60 cluster to establish the link to the previous study [24], the Ar atom, and the
Na+
9 cluster. The ﬁrst two samples, C60 and Ar , show a very similar behavior and
one is tempted to expect a generic signal formed only by laser properties. However,
the Na+
9 cluster yields a CEP dependence with exactly opposite pattern which clearly
demonstrates a strong impact of the electronic system. The diﬀerence between Ar
and Na+
9 suggests naturally a relation to their much diﬀerent spectral response. This
assumption is, in fact, conﬁrmed by the case of C60. Although this large cluster is
structurally much diﬀerent from the Ar atom the spectral relations are similar to Ar in
that the dipole strength lies far above the IR frequency and is rather fragmented. We
shall thus continue our investigations keeping only Ar and Na+
9 for the sake of simplicity.

diﬀerent pulse lengths Tpulse. Let us ﬁrst look at extremely short pulses, Tpulse = 2τIR,
i.e. practically less than two optical cycles because of the the proﬁle shape (see Fig. 1).
Here, the CEP dependence of the asymmetry is very similar for both systems (Ar and
Na+
9 ) and the asymmetry is more or less the same over the whole range of Ekin. The
independence from the system is plausible because very short pulses give the system
little chance to develop its dynamical response such that the shape of the external laser
pulse dominates the process and this is the same in all systems. The independence from
the CEP is also plausible because too short pulses have basically one or two dominating
peaks which gives little chances for ponderomotive eﬀects which otherwise can produce
a diﬀerence between low-energy and high-energy emission [24]. The emission maxima
(corresponding to η ∼ ±1) lie at φCEP = 90◦ and φCEP = 270◦. These are the situations
where exactly two equally strong peaks compete and the preferred direction of emission
coincides with the direction of the second peak. For example, the second of the large
peaks points to negative z for φCEP = 90◦, see Fig. 1, and so backward emission (η ≈ −1)
prevails. This agrees with the analysis of detailed time dependence in section 3.3 which
shows that the emission from earlier peaks is practically pushed back by the subsequent
counter-peaks and that emission from the last peak experiences least hindrance.

However, when slightly longer pulses are considered, the picture changes. Directly
above Tpulse = 2τIR comes a region where pattern change quickly and the diﬀerence
between Ar and Na+
9 develops. Already at Tpulse = 2.4τIR we can see a striking diﬀerence
between the patterns for Ar and Na+
9 : while in the case of Na+
9 , (right panel), the
asymmetry has not changed signiﬁcantly as compared to Tpulse = 2.0τIR, the asymmetry
In the latter case, the asymmetry
has developed a clear energy dependence for Ar.
in the low-energy and high-energy ranges show opposite behavior:
for instance, for
φCEP = 240◦, low energy electrons (≈ 5–10 eV) are mainly emitted in forward direction,
while high energy electrons ≈ 22 eV backward. The reason for this behavior lies in
the optical properties of the ﬁeld and the electronic response: for a pulse duration of
T = 2.4τIR, the electric ﬁeld explores already a bit more oscillations which enhances the
playground for ponderomotive motion and this, in turn, gives the high-energy electron a
diﬀerent emission dynamics. This behavior is similar to the one found in C60 previously
and discussed in [24]. One then wonders why this does not happen in the same manner
for Na+
9 . The key point is here that the external driving ﬁeld and the dipole response
run out of phase due to the impact of the strong plasmon resonance. This interferes with
the mechanism worked out for Ar and C60. In section 3.3, the diﬀerence in dynamical
behaviors will be analyzed based on the detailed time evolution of electron density.

Finally, when going to even longer pulses, the asymmetry vanishes altogether. The
reason for this behavior is obvious. Longer pulses contain more optical cycles, the
individual peaks of the electric ﬁeld that point into opposite directions with nearly equal
strength and the CEP does not make much of a diﬀerence any more. It is interesting,
however, that the smoothing of asymmetry pattern as a function of CEP starts for Na+
9
already at Tpulse = 3τIR while it takes up to much larger Tpulse to reach that stage for
Ar. The reason is, again, the diﬀerent optical response. The interference of external

process and so spoils CEP dependence earlier.

9 perturbs the emission

3.3. Time evolution in detail

In order to get a deeper insight into emission direction, we analyze the time evolution
of electron density for a pulse length in the critical regime, Tpulse = 2.6τIR, and here for
φCEP = 270◦ where the diﬀerence between Ar and Na+

9 is most marked.

The lower panel of ﬁgure 4 shows the densities for Ar and Na+

9 as 3D color map
plot. This is complemented by the full ARPES in the upper panel and time evolution
of external ﬁeld together with volume dipole moment in the middle panel. The notion
of a “volume dipole” requires an explanation. The normal dipole moment d = (cid:82) d3r z ρ
is blurred by pieces of emitted electronic density far away from the system, i.e. at
large z. However, we are interested on a signal from the bulk density at the system.
In order to focus on the regions of high density, we consider the z moment of ρ2, i.e.
d(2) = (cid:82) d3r z ρ2, which we call volume dipole because it emphasizes the volume rather
than the surface.

The ARPES in the upper panel illustrates how the asymmetry pattern (see ﬁgure
3) are generated. For Ar, we see a preference of backward emission (angle 180◦) at
energies around 5 eV turning to a bias on backward emission for higher energies > 20
eV while for Na+
9 backward emission prevails in the whole range (except for very low
energies < 2 eV), in accordance with the panel for Tpulse = 2.6τIR in ﬁgure 3.

Dipole and ﬁeld signals in the middle panel illustrate nicely the dramatic diﬀerences
in the systems response. Already the dipole amplitude for Ar is much smaller than for
Na+
9 which indicates that Ar is a much less responsive system. This oﬀ-resonant behavior
for Ar is also visible from the fact that the dipole signal follows the external ﬁeld in phase.
There are small, fast oscillations super-imposed in the dipole signal which stem from
a small excitation of systems frequencies. The Na+
9 cluster behaves much diﬀerently.
Here we see already in the ﬁrst oscillation a large phase shift of dipole versus external
ﬁeld. The shift changes along the signal. It seems that the dipole response has a trend
to oscillate with the faster plasmon frequency rather than those of the external ﬁeld.
Mind that emission is driven by the dipole moment whereas propagation of the emitted
electron follows the external ﬁeld. These two ingredients now run at diﬀerent pace for
Na+
9 producing a subtle interplay of driving forces. The trends thus can go in any
direction and it requires detailed modeling to make predictions for such highly reactive
systems.

Finally, the lower panel of ﬁgure 4 shows the time evolution of electron density
along z axis (laser polarization axis). Logarithmic scale is chosen to visualize the outer
tail of the electron distribution which represents electron emission. In the ﬁrst 3 fs, we
see outbursts of electrons which are, however, turned back to the center. Consider the
ﬁrst bump toward negative z. This outﬂow is triggered by the ﬁrst peak of E(t), or
d(2)(T ) respectively. It moves on until the opposite peak in ﬁeld strengths pushes it back

The impact of the carrier envelope phase ...

to the center. The same happens with electrons emitted through the second (positive)
peak in direction of positive z. Here the counter-force in negative direction does not
complete its job and part of the backﬂow merges with the outgoing wave from the second
positive peak. The waves ﬁnally reaching the boundaries stem all from the latest peaks
of the pulse which are not counter-weighted by subsequent opposite peaks. The ﬁnal
outﬂow mixes electrons which are directly emitted with those which have gained more

energy by rescattering processes. This is indicated by the lines drawn into the plot. The
black lines visualize ﬂow with a high kinetic energy of 21 eV and the green ones with a
low kinetic energy of 9 eV. For Ar, the dominance of the external ﬁeld over the dipole
response (mind the scaling in the left middle panel) enhances the ponderomotive eﬀects
and thus the high-energy electrons can only escape after the last peak, thus in forward
direction. For Na+
9 , on the other hand, the external ﬁeld is considerably weaker which
allows high-energy electrons to escape already the second last peak pointing in negative
direction. This, however, should not be taken as general rule. The subtle interplay of
drivers in Na+

9 inhibits simple estimates.

3.4. Impact of the systems geometry

To check the eﬀect of ionic background, we compare in ﬁgure 5 results from a calculation
with ionic background with one using a soft jellium background [39]. We use for the
jellium parameters a Wigner-Seitz radius of rs = 3.65a0 and surface thickness of 1a0
to place the surface plasmon resonance at similar spectral position as for the case of
ionic background. The pulse length is chosen in the critical regime to explore most
sensitivity to system parameters. The results are qualitatively the same. There are, of
course, diﬀerences in detail. But these could very well be due to the slightly diﬀerent
spectral properties of the two systems. We can safely conclude that details of the
background structure do not matter much for the structure of ARPES at these (low)
laser frequencies. Note, however, that a sensitivity to ionic detail develops for laser
pulses with higher frequencies a,d was found in earlier studies on angular distributions
[46].

3.5. Impact of laser parameters

So far, we have considered laser pulses with frequency and intensity close to the
experimental conditions of former studies in C60. It is, of course, interesting to check
the inﬂuence of laser parameters. We do that here for the case of Na+
9 . Figure 6 shows

The left column collects variation of frequency. The high-frequency case (lower left

pulses in ﬁgure 3 and, in fact, we encounter here a similar situation. At an absolute scale,
the pulses are extremely short thus overruling any system response. The resonant case
(middle left panel) at surface plasmon frequency looks somewhat blurred resembling the
cases with longer pulses in ﬁgure 3. Indeed, we deal eﬀectively with a long pulse because
the resonant excitation induces dipole oscillations which carry on long after the external
ﬁeld has been turned oﬀ. The extremely low frequency (upper left panel) moves the

photon ﬁeld well out of resonance, similar as the IR ﬁeld was oﬀ resonance for Ar. But
the pattern do not show the regular trends as in case of Ar. The quasi-static ﬁeld at
this extremely low frequency creates a very special situation. Although ﬁeld strength
seems weak, the long time a certain pulling force persists leads to large ponderomotive
excursions. This together with a small amount of comparatively much faster plasmon
oscillations generates these sort of chaotic, quickly changing asymmetries.

The right column of ﬁgure 6 collects variation of ﬁeld strength. The upper right
panel repeats the reference case which we had studied before in detail. Lower ﬁeld
strength (middle and lower right panels) reduce the ponderomotive eﬀects even further
and so diminish the diﬀerences between high-energy and low-energy electrons. What
remains is pronounced forward emission for CEP 0◦ following the strongest peak in that
case and correspondingly pronounced backward emission for 180◦.

4. Conclusion

In continuation of a previous study on C60, we have investigated the system dependence
of the impact of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of few-cycle laser pulses using as
two very diﬀerent systems an Ar atom and a Na+
9 cluster. As theoretical tool for this
survey we use time-dependent density functional theory using standard local energy-
density functionals. A self-interaction correction is added to achieve a correct dynamical
description of emission properties. As in previous experimental and theoretical studies,
we take as key observable the detailed electronic emission properties in angular
resolved photo-electron spectra (ARPES). The angular information is compressed to
the asymmetry of the angular distribution as function of energy which yields a compact
measure well suited for a survey of varying conditions.

The two systems under consideration diﬀer dramatically in their spectral properties.
The Ar atom has a rather rigid dipole response with the ﬁrst excitations lying high above
IR frequencies. In this respect, the Ar atom is similar to the C60 cluster. Although the
latter has a much more complex background structure the results for asymmetry as
function of CEP are practically the same for these both systems. Quite diﬀerently, the
Na+
9 cluster has a large polarizability and its spectrum is dominated by the strong surface
plasmon resonance in the visible range, above IR frequencies but not too far away. In
consequence, the results for ARPES from few cycle pulses diﬀer dramatically from those
of the Ar atom. By looking at the time evolution of density in detail, this diﬀerence
could be clearly related to the diﬀerent dynamical polarizability. The dipole moment of
Ar follows the external ﬁeld without delay whereas for Na+
9 it starts with a sizable phase
shift from the onset and develops further phase deviations in the course of dynamics.
This produces a much diﬀerent interplay between electron emission, triggered by the
dipole moment, and subsequent ponderomotive motion, governed by the external ﬁeld.
The more involved interplay between dipole and external ﬁeld in case of Na+
9 hinders to
develop simple predictions. A full simulation taking into account properly the dynamical
response of a system is necessary.

Concerning variation of laser parameters, the length of the pulse plays a key role
for the impact of the CEP. Longer pulses covering several optical cycles render the
CEP unimportant. Very short pulses, up to 2 cycles, reduce the impact of the systems
response and let the eﬀects of external ﬁeld dominate. In between comes a transitional
region where the CEP dependence of ARPES changes quickly and becomes extremely
system dependent. We also checked the inﬂuence of the other laser parameters for the
more responsive system Na+
9 in the critical, transitional regime of pulse lengths and ﬁnd,
not surprisingly, a sensitive dependence to any parameter. The qualitative structure of
the results can be explained in each case by the relative importance of ponderomotive
motion in the external ﬁeld and dipole response of the system.
