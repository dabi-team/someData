Abstract 

Red  lead  and  lead  white  are  some  of  the  most  ancient  and  common  pigments  in  mural  paintings. 
However, they tend to blacken with time due to their oxidation to plattnerite (β-PbO2). The possibility 
to  induce  the  reconversion  reactions  by  CW  laser  heating  is  hereby  discussed.  A  thermodynamic 
study  by  TGA  showed  that  direct  cerussite  or  hydrocerussite  formation  from  plattnerite  are  not 
suitable reconversion routes, which was confirmed by laser irradiation trials under CO2 and CO2/H2O 
fluxes. Minium (Pb3O4) and subsequent massicot (β-PbO) formation from plattnerite were achieved 
(confirmed by SEM-EDS, XRD and micro-Raman) under Ar+, 810 nm diode and Nd:YAG lasers. 
The  latter  appears  to  be  the  most  suited  for  restauration  purposes,  given  the  broad  minium 
reconversion  irradiance  range.  This  is  confirmed  by  successful  trials  on  macroscopic  areas  of 
naturally darkened red lead containing samples.

Highlights 

•  Thermal decomposition of plattnerite in CO2 at 100 °C min-1 leads to the formation of minium 

(490 °C) and massicot (640 °C) 

•  Direct formation of cerussite or hydrocerussite from plattnerite is not a suitable reconversion 

route 

•  Top-hat Nd:YAG irradiation is suitable to achieve minium and massicot reconversion for 

restauration purposes 

Intro 

Of the many pigments that were used in easel as well as in mural paintings, lead-based pigments – 
particularly  red  lead  and  lead  white  –  are  definitely  the  earliest  and  most  widespread  [1],  [2]. 
However, when used in mural paintings, they tends to blacken with time, which has been known for 
a long time [2]–[4], causing a visual imbalance that can ruin the aesthetic of the artworks [5], [6]. 
Oxidation to plattnerite seems to be in cause [6]–[17] in numerous murals [17]–[29]. Experimental 
lead white restoration treatments involving chemical reagents to achieve the reconversion1 have been 
used [30], [31], but they put the pictorial layers supports at risks as recent research shows [15]–[18]. 
Besides, continuous wave Nd:YAG and 810 nm diode lasers were proved to be suitable tools for the 
thermal  reconversion  of  blackened  red  lead  [32],  [33].  If  the  same  technique  could  be  applied  on 
several other blackened pigments, it might lead to the development of a new restoration portable tool, 
in the same way Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is currently used for building stones cleaning [34]–[36]. 
Numerous  advantages  are  associated  with  the  use  of  a  laser:  it  is  intuitive  and  easy-to-configure, 
relatively cheap, and the direct control over the treated area and the use of an optical fibre make it a 
portable tool. Here, we address the possibility of reconverting blackened red lead and lead white on 
mural paintings by the use of continuous wave lasers. 

Besides minium (Pb3O4), red lead pigment may contain lead monoxide (α-PbO, litharge and β-PbO, 
massicot), which is less stable, as an impurity resulting from the pigment manufacture process [5]. 
Due to the high colouring strength of minium, such impurities have little influence on the chromatic 
properties of the pigment [1]. Aze et al. wrote a review of red lead alteration in artwork, along with 
ascribed darkening mechanisms and aggravating conditions [5]. Red lead darkening originates from 
the transformation of minium into plattnerite (β-PbO2) [12]–[14]. Such an alteration process has often 
been reported on fresco-like mural paintings [27]–[29]. No restoration method has been developed, 
most likely due to the complexity of the lead-oxygen system, which includes numerous crystalline 
varieties. Minium  then  massicot (β-PbO),  as well as  other intermediate  products are  formed from 
plattnerite when increasing the temperature at temperatures summarized in table S-2 in the SI section 
[37]–[45].  Thermal  reduction  of  plattnerite  under  a  Raman  laser  beam,  which  complicated  the 
analysis, was reported by Burgio et al. [46]. Aze et al. successfully profited from this phenomenon 
to achieve the thermal reconversion of blackened minium by continuous wave (CW) Ar+ (514 nm) 
and Nd:YAG (1064 nm) lasers irradiation [32]. 

1 Reconversion is hereby used in the sense of a chemical reaction (conversion) taking place backward. Here the 
conversion is the oxidation to plattnerite; the reconversion is thus the formation of cerussite or hydrocerussite (white) or 
minium (red) from plattnerite (black) [6].

Lead white’s main component is hydrocerussite (2PbCO3∙Pb(OH)2), but cerussite (PbCO3) can be 
present as well, both being in chemical equilibrium [7], [47], [48]. Depending on the “stack process” 
[49], [50] parameters, the hydrocerussite/cerussite ratio can range from 1:2 to 3:1 [51], [52]. Lead 
white was used alone, or as an admixture together with calcite, gypsum, kaolin or baryte, in a variety 
of media such as linseed oil, gum Arabic, egg yolk, egg tempera and animal glue [2]. The blackening 
of lead white in mural painting is frequent and usually ascribed to its oxidation to plattnerite, which 
was sparingly used as a black pigment [53]. Thermal decomposition of hydrocerussite and cerussite 
leading to plattnerite was  already studied by various authors (tables S-3 and S-4 in the SI section 
summarize  these  studies).  Tables  S-5  and  S-6  in  the  supplementary  information  (SI)  present  an 
exhaustive review of lead white oxidation in mural paintings [8], [9], [15], [18]–[26], [54]–[59] and 
in art objects [60]–[64]. Kotulanová et al. showed that in aqueous solution, the oxidation of lead white 
to plattnerite is only observed in presence of strong oxidizing agents [7]. Petushkova and Lyalikova 
found  that  H2O2-releasing  bacteria,  which  developed  in  the  animal  glue-based  binder,  could  be 
responsible for lead white oxidation [8]. Giovannoni et al. showed that the alkaline lime environment 
of  a  fresco  mural  painting  lowers  the  Pb(IV)/Pb(II)  redox  potential  sufficiently  for  the  plattnerite 
formation  to  be  caused  by  weak  oxidizing  agents  such  as  hydrogen  peroxide  in  high  humidity 
conditions [15], which is in line with the Pourbaix diagram of lead [65]. Bernard et al. found that at 
pH = 8.4,  the  potential  required  to  oxide  hydrocerussite  to  plattnerite  is  0.7 V  [64];  incidentally, 
oxidation of hydrocerussite to plattnerite at pH 8.4 in chlorinated water was reported [66]. Vagnini 
et al. found evidences of plattnerite formation in a secco murals, which made them question the role 
of chlorine [9]. And later, they showed that the alkalinity of a fresco murals is not sufficient for the 
oxidation to be spontaneous and thus that it requires an oxidizing agent [10]. In a nutshell, plattnerite 
formation from lead white seems to happen in the presence of oxidizing agents, the required strength 
of which being determined by the alkalinity of the painting. Besides, the composition of lead white 
seem to play an important role, as cerussite and hydrocerussite face different alteration patterns, the 
latter being more reactive [7], [10], [67]. Few methods of restoration of blackened lead white have 
been tested [15], [18], [25], [30], [31], but they involve chemical treatments which put the support at 
risks [15], [18]. 

Our assessment of the potentiality of using CW lasers (Nd:YAG, Ar+ and diode) to restore darkened 
red  lead  and  lead  white-containing  mural  paintings  is  hereby  reported.  It  is  grounded  on  a 
thermodynamic study of the reconversion reaction by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and on laser 
irradiation  trials  monitored  by  infrared  (IR)  thermography.  We  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  the 
treatment  on pure plattnerite pellets, and naturally darkened  mural  painting  samples coming from 
experimental ageing walls. We studied the irradiation conditions influences (laser wavelength, beam 
profile, irradiance, time) on the reconverted layers compositions, homogeneities and thicknesses. The 
latter  were  characterized  by  spectrocolorimetry,  scanning  electron  microscopies  (SEM),  X-ray 
diffraction  (XRD)  and  micro-Raman  spectroscopy.  We  present  here  the  results  and  discuss  them 
within the framework of the development of a restoration tool.

Study of the reconversion reactions. The first part of our study aimed at determining the parameters 
of the reconversion reactions following equations 1, 2 and 3. Their Gibbs free energies of reaction 
ΔG  were  first  calculated  in  order  to  determine  in  which  temperature  range  they  are 
thermodynamically possible. We then had to examine the thermal decomposition of plattnerite, which 
has been studied in air by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [37]–[45]. Table S-2 in the SI section 
summarizes  the  plattnerite  →  minium  and  minium  →  massicot  reaction  temperatures  that  were 
measured by these authors. On the other hand, the thermal decomposition of plattnerite in a CO2 or 
in a CO2/H2O atmosphere was never studied. We thus conducted this study by TGA with a CO2 flux 
and the reactions products were characterized by means of µ-DRX. Note that, conversely, the thermal 
decomposition of hydrocerussite and cerussite [41], [68]–[71], sometimes in a CO2 atmosphere [72]–
[74] have already been studied (tables S-3 and S-4 in the SI section).

Laser  heating  modelling.  We  then  attempted  to  model  the  thermal  response  of  plattnerite  when 
irradiated  by  a  CW  Nd:YAG  laser.  We  first  determined  some  optical  and  thermal  parameters.  Its 
specific  heat  capacity,  which  is  temperature-dependent,  was  measured  by  differential  scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) (figure S-2 in the SI section). Its reflectance at 1064 nm was measured with a UV-
Visible-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (Figure S-3 in the SI section) 
Other parameters were extrapolated, as explained in [75] We then used a previously developed 3D 
analytical model of the laser heating of materials absorbing energy from an incident laser beam. The 
experimental results were properly modelled in the first times of irradiation. However, after a few 
seconds the model does not reproduce the laser heating, due to the lack of consideration of convection 
and radiation phenomena [75], which is why these results will not be further discussed here.

Figure 1: laser reconversion and IR thermography experimental setup 

Laboratory laser reconversion trials. Lastly, laser irradiation trials were conducted on pure plattnerite 
pellets  as  well  as  on  naturally  aged  red  lead-containing  paint  samples.  Figure  1  describes  the 
experimental setup we used for the laser irradiation trials: the laser beam – and the gas flux (CO2 or 
CO2/H2O) in the context of lead white reconversion  – were  directed toward the sample.  The goal 
being  to  achieve  a  thermal  treatment  and  not  an  ablation,  the  use  of  continuous  wave  lasers  was 
preferred  to  that  of  Q-switched  lasers.  An  IR  camera  was  used  in  order  to  monitor  the  surface 
temperature evolution during laser irradiation. In order to do so, the emissivity of plattnerite in the IR 
camera detection range was first determined by heating a pellet and measuring its temperature with a 
thermocouple. The influence of the laser irradiance, irradiation time, wavelength and beam profile on 
the 
samples  areas  were  characterized  by 
spectrocolorimetry, SEM-EDS and XRD. SEM, Optical microscopy and Raman were also used in 
order  to  study  reconverted  samples  cross  sections.  Note  that  Raman  analysis  of  plattnerite  is 
complicated by its sensitivity under the laser beam, which Burgio et al. and more recently Costantini 
et al. managed to assess [46], [76].

Study of the reconversion reactions. Figures S-4, S-5 and S-6 in the SI section show the calculated 
Gibbs  free  energies  ΔG  and  enthalpy  ΔH  of  the  envisaged  reconversion  reactions.  No  data  were 
available for the plattnerite to hydrocerussite reaction. We determined the temperature thresholds at 
which the ΔG changes sign. The reactions are thermodynamically feasible when ΔG < 0, thus in the 
temperature ranges summarized in table 1. Moreover, the sign of ΔH indicates if the reactions are 
endothermic  or  exothermic  in  the  considered  temperature  range.  The  thermal  decomposition  of 
plattnerite in air was already studied by TGA, and the compounds were identified. The plattnerite to 
minium reaction occurs at 375 °C [38] and the minium to massicot reaction occurs at 552 °C [41] 
(see table S-2 in the SI section for other results from various authors). These results are in line with 
the temperature threshold that we determined. We found that annealing plattnerite at 455 °C during 

5 

 
 
6 h yields pure minium (verified by XRD, as figure S-7 and table S-7 in the SI section show). In order 
to see if it is possible to form PbCO3 from plattnerite, we studied its thermal decomposition in CO2 
and characterized the reaction products by  µ-XRD at various temperatures (diagrams displayed in 
figure S-8 in the SI section). Figure 2 displays the resulting TGA curve and identification results. It 
shows first a small mass loss attributable to water desorption then a mass intake until ca. 200 °C, 
followed by a slight mass loss until ca. 400 °C. No chemical or structural change is detected in this 
temperature range by µ-XRD. Two major reactions then happen at 490 °C and 640 °C respectively 
(local minimum value of the first derivative of the TG signal). These correspond to mass losses of 
4.36 % and 6.47 % respectively (local maximum value of the first derivative of the TG signal, 0.01 
% precision). Measured mass losses are consistent with the theoretical values that are expected for 
minium (4.46 %) and massicot (6.69 %) that have been identified by µ-XRD. No cerussite has been 
formed in these conditions. Basing ourselves on the calculated Gibbs free energy of reaction (table 
1), we let plattnerite in CO2 during 50 h at 250 °C, using a slower temperature ramp (5 °C min-1). No 
mass  intake  or  loss  happened  and  the  resulting  product  has  been  identified  as  plattnerite.  The 
carbonatation of plattnerite in dry CO2 is probably kinetically so disfavoured that it is not a viable 
route to achieve the reconversion.

products that were identified by µ-XRD. 

IR  Thermography.  In  order  to  monitor  the  temperature,  we  needed  plattnerite  emissivity  in  the 
measurement range of the IR camera, [7.5; 13] µm. We used the value measured by Schmidt : a 0.3 
“IR emissivity” on lead dioxide coatings designed for solar panels [77]. Another source indicates a 
0.28 emissivity  at  258 °C  in  the  [2.5; 50] µm  range  [78].  We  were  then  able  to  monitor  the 
temperature evolution during laser irradiation with the IR camera (figure 1). Figure 3a displays the 
evolution of radial temperature during laser irradiation, using a CW Gaussian shaped 1080 nm diode 
laser. At 1 s, the profile is quasi-Gaussian, with a ΔT dropping at 1/e of the maximum at a 1.8 mm 
radial distance which is close to the laser beam 1/e radius. As the irradiation goes on, the temperature 
variation profile gets further from a Gaussian profile, with an increasing radius at 1/e of maximum 
ΔT (figure S-9 in the SI section). This can be explained by lateral thermal diffusion happening at long 

6 

 
 
irradiation times. Figure 3b shows the maximum temperature measured near the centre of the pellet. 
When  no  reconversion  is  observed  it  reaches  a  plateau  which  is  higher  as  the  laser  irradiance 
increases. Energy can be lost by convection, radiation and diffusion, leading to the saturation that is 
observed. However, the broadening of the temperature profile that is observed on figure 3a indicates 
that diffusion is probably the most important phenomenon. Figure 3c shows the plateau temperature 
rising linearly with the laser irradiance (r² = 0.9961 for a linear fit). This is expected and confirms 
that neither the emissivity nor other optical and thermal parameters of plattnerite vary much over this 
temperature  range.  Above  152 kW m-2,  which  corresponds  to  a  plateau  temperature  of  375 °C, 
plattnerite  is  expected  to  decompose  into  minium,  according  to  the  reaction  temperature  that  was 
measured by Clark et al. [38]. 

Figure 3a) Radial surface temperature rise of a 317 µm thick plattnerite pellet exposed by the 
Gaussian shaped 1080 nm laser (r1/e = 1.74 mm) at a 137 kW m2 irradiance at various irradiation 
times. The best Gaussian fit of the beam intensity is plotted in grey. b) Evolution of the maximum 
measured surface temperature in the same conditions as figure 3a. c) Plateau temperatures measured 
on a plattnerite pellet exposed at various irradiances by the Gaussian shaped 1080 nm laser. 

Laser reconversion trials. The thermal reduction of plattnerite to minium that indeed occurs in the 
same  conditions  at  irradiances  higher  than  152 kW m-2  is  clearly  noticeable  under  the  form  of  a 
red/orange spot (figure 4a). Modifications of the plattnerite pellets colours occurred between 5 and 
10 seconds of irradiation, in accordance with figure 3b. No further visual or chemical difference is 
observed  at  higher  irradiation  times.  Spectrocolorimetric  measurements  show  an  increase  of  the 
specular reflectance at wavelengths longer than 560 nm (Figure 4b). This is consistent with the optical 
properties of plattnerite and minium (see figure S-10 in the SI section for the standard spectra of these 
compounds). The corresponding L*a*b* values indicate that the irradiated area turns to red with a 
ΔE  of  34.  We  found  a  good  agreement  between  the  experimental  reconversion  threshold  and  the 
threshold we predicted from IR thermography measurements and Clark et al.’s results (figure 3c). 
This can be interpreted as a confirmation that the IR emissivity we measured is plausible. Above the 
reconversion  threshold,  the  temperature  keeps  increasing  without  showing  no  plateau  and  then 
decreases slowly. Minium absorbs less than plattnerite at the laser wavelength (figure 3b) and would 
thus be less heated by the laser, which can be a possible explanation to this. Other changes in the 
thermal property can also explain this observation. Moreover, the endothermicity of the reaction can 
also be part of the phenomenon. However, the fact that both plattnerite and minium can be present in 
these  samples  and  that  they  have  somewhat  different  IR  emissivity  (minium  emissivity is  0.93  at 
398 °C [78]) prevent us to discuss these IR thermography data further.

reflectance spectra of the irradiated and pristine areas of the same pellet. Colour patches have been 
displayed using the RGB values calculated from the L*a*b* coordinates. 

Power density threshold. The above results were obtained with a Gaussian shaped laser beam. The 
energy being concentrated in the inner part of the beam (figure 5b), the surface temperature reached 
during irradiation is higher when closer to the beam centre. The diameter of the reconverted minium 
area  on  figure  4a  is  1.23 mm.  It  was  obtained  at  205 kW m2  with  a  3.48 mm  beam  diameter  (1/e 
value). According to the Gaussian distribution of power, the reconversion is thus effective at power 
densities higher than 181 kW m-2.

Figure 5a) Massicot (yellow) formed in the centre of a reconverted minium area (red/orange) at 
high Ar+ laser irradiance. b) Gaussian laser beam profile which explains the phenomenon. 

Massicot formation at high irradiances. Using a top-hat CW Nd:YAG laser a yellow compound, later 
identified as massicot β-PbO, was created at irradiances higher than 2605 kW m2. This is expected, 
since  massicot  is  formed  from  minium  at  552 °C  [41].  The  wide  range  between  the  irradiance 
threshold of reconversion to minium and to massicot is likely due to the fact that minium absorbs less 
in the infrared range than plattnerite, and is thus heated less efficiently. This can be a problem when 
using a Gaussian shaped laser beam, as shown by figure 5a: the central area has been reconverted to 
massicot whereas a minium ring is formed around massicot, as the micro-Raman identification show 
(figure S-11 in the SI section). In this case, the power density is so high at the centre of the beam that 
massicot is formed, and high enough around the centre of the beam to form minium (figure 5b). This 
phenomenon can be a problem in the context of a restauration process. Therefore, the use of a top-
hat laser beam profile would be better.

Laser wavelength influence. We used an Ar+ (488 nm) and a FAP-S (810 nm) laser and conducted the 
same  reconversion  trials.  We  observed  the  same  processes  of  minium  then  massicot  formation, 
although at somewhat different irradiance, summarized in table 2. The minium reconversion threshold 
is  higher  for  the  Ar+  than  for  the  1080 nm  diode  laser,  both  being  Gaussian-shaped.  A  higher 
absorbance of plattnerite at 1080 nm than at 488 nm could explain this difference. The various beam 
profiles make it risky to compare the other reconversion thresholds. However, we can still notice that 
the irradiance range in which minium is formed, before it turns to massicot, is wider in the case of 
the Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) than in the case of the FSP-S diode laser (810 nm), which is itself wider 
than in the case of the Ar+ laser (480 nm). This is explained by the considerably higher absorption of 
shorter wavelengths by minium than higher wavelengths. In practice, a suitable Ar+ laser irradiance 
for plattnerite reduction into pure minium was practically unreachable. A secondary transformation 
into  massicot  was  subsequently  achieved  through  excess  local  heating,  which  makes  this  laser 
unsuitable for restoration purposes. 

Figure 6: darkened red lead paint sample after irradiation by a CW top-hat Nd:YAG laser (red part 
on the right) at 1000 kW m-2. The lighter stains designated by an arrow are due to gypsum. Cracks 
were present before the treatment. 

Naturally aged samples. Irradiation tests on darkened red lead-containing paint samples showed the 
same results. However, the irradiance thresholds were notably higher than those measured for pure 
plattnerite pellets. It is possible that such differences originate from the higher reflectivity of naturally 
aged paint samples. This latter is attributed to the presence of gypsum, which appeared during ageing, 
but  also  to  the  brown  colour  of  finely  divided  plattnerite  particles.  It  can  also  be  attributed  to 
differences in the surface state of the samples, in terms of rugosity or porosity. Large-scale irradiation 
tests were carried out at by translating the sample under the laser beam along two directions, with a 
mean local irradiation time of ca. 5 seconds. The laser irradiance (1000 kW m-2 calculated by using 
the 1/e beam radius) was selected so that all plattnerite grains were transformed into minium. Such 

10 

 
 
treatment produced a quasi-uniform red area (figure 6). The presence of lighter stains arises from 
gypsum,  which  did  not  evolve  during  laser  irradiation.  Observations  of  the  sample  cross-section 
(figure S-12 and S-13 in the SI section) show that the whole darkened layer has been reverted into a 
50 to 80 µm thick red homogeneous phase. Such depth efficiency may result from the heat diffusion 
within the alteration layer. XRD and micro-Raman analyses of this phase confirmed the presence of 
minium,  without  any  lower  lead  oxide  in  the  reconverted  layer  (figure  S-14  and  S-15  in  the  SI 
section). 

Lead white reconversion. Laser trials were also made on plattnerite with a CO2 or CO2/H2O input. 
The same reactions were observed, but the gaseous flux had a cooling effect and the reconversion 
irradiance threshold were thus higher. No specie other than minium or massicot were found. This is 
consistent  with  the  TGA  results,  which  show  no  carbonatation  of  plattnerite  in  CO2  and  clearly 
indicates  that  the  reactions  described  by  equations  2  and  3  are  not  suitable  reconversion  routes. 
Minium  [79]–[82]  and  PbO  [83],  [84]  can  react  with  H2O  and  CO2  at  the  solid  state  to  form 
hydrocerussite  or  cerussite.  Note  that  the  formation  of  plumbonacrite,  a  white  compound,  from 
minium has also been evidenced [85]. Often, the formation of cerussite or hydrocerussite from PbO 
(generally identified as massicot) is observed spontaneously in air at ambient temperature when the 
latter is the degradation product of lead white irradiated by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser beam [86]–
[91].  Hence,  it  could  be  possible  to  form  cerussite  or  hydrocerussite  from  plattnerite  via  the 
intermediary  formation  of  massicot  and  its  subsequent  exposition  to  ambient  CO2  or  CO2/H2O. 
Studying  the  latter  reaction  is  a  first  step  toward  the  assessment  of  the  possibility  to  reconvert 
darkened lead white by this route.  

Conclusion 

The formation of cerussite from plattnerite in CO2, an exothermic reaction spontaneous under 320 °C 
was  not  observed  during  thermogravimetric  analysis.  Only  the  formation  of  minium  (at  490 °C) 
massicot (at 640 °C) were observed. We monitored the temperature during laser irradiation trials by 
IR thermography. In air, we observed an irradiance threshold under which the temperature rises to a 
plateau and above which reconversion to minium takes place at the expected temperature (375 °C). 
Plateau  temperature  rises  linearly  with  irradiance,  indicating  that  plattnerite  thermal  and  optical 
parameter vary little in this temperature range. Spectrocolorimetric measurement show a reddening 
of the sample with a ΔE of 34, compatible with a reconversion to minium. At high irradiances, the 
formation of massicot is also observed. Minium and massicot reconversion thresholds depend on the 
laser wavelength. Nd:YAG minium reconversion range ([109; 2605] kW m-2 in the case of a top hat 
laser) is wider than AR+ and 810 nm diode lasers ranges. Successful trials were made on naturally 
darkened red led containing paint samples, moving and spending 5 s under the 1000 kW m-2 top-hat 
Nd:YAG beam. XRD and micro-Raman indeed detected the presence of pure minium in reconverted 
layers. The reconversion of plattnerite to lead white by a 1080 nm diode laser beam under gaseous 
flux (CO2 or CO2/H2O) did not happen, in line with TGA results. 

We can conclude from these results that fibered lasers are suitable to achieve the reconversion of 
minium and massicot in mural paintings. Particularly, the top-hat Nd:YAG laser is best adapted for 
restauration purposes, given its broad minium reconversion irradiance range and its homogeneous 
power density distribution. It was shown to yield good results for the treatment of a large area of a 
naturally aged sample, showing its suitability in restauration conditions. The direct route we assessed 

11 

 
for lead white reconversion, namely the carbonatation of plattnerite, was however unsuccessful. The 
formation of massicot as an intermediate product, which could later react with ambient CO2 and H2O 
to form cerussite and hydrocerussite, is a promising reconversion route.

Supplementary information 

Experimental section 

Pure  plattnerite  samples.  Pure  150  to  700 µm  thick  and  10 mm  diameter  plattnerite  pellets  were 
pressed (three times at 100 kN for 10 mins) from 97 % pure commercially available powder (Alfa 
Aesar  A12742,  Lot  number  10213539).  XRD  showed  no  difference  between  the  powder  and  the 
pressed pellet. 

Naturally aged red lead-containing paint samples. These were taken from experimental wall paintings 
[92]. Previous investigations of red lead alteration revealed the transformation of minium phase into 
plattnerite in  the darkened areas [12].  In addition,  most of the darkened samples contain gypsum, 
most likely as a result of the sulfation of the original calcic material. 

ΔG  calculations.  The  Gibbs  free  energies  of  reaction  were  calculated  with  the  HSC  Chemistry 
software. 

TGA. A Setaram B24 thermogravimetric analyser was used in the following conditions. We degassed 
the crucibles at 1000 °C for a few days before use. The sample crucible is usually loaded with ca. 
90 mg PbO2 and the crucible usually weight ca. 325 mg. Before each trial stabilization of the system 
took place at 30 °C for 3 h. The crucibles are subjected to a 0.5 L min-1 Ar flux and a 2.1 L min-1 CO2 
flux. The mass change detection limit is equal to 10 µg in these conditions. A blank trial was first 
made with an empty crucible as a baseline for an exploratory trial until 700 °C. The samples were 
heated up to the desired temperature 100 °C min-1, then spent 10 min at the plateau temperature before 
being cooled down to ambient temperature at 100 °C min-1. Temperatures corresponding to assumed 
chemical changes were then selected and the same profile was chosen to get to these temperatures. 
Resulting products were characterized by µ-XRD. 

µ-XRD. The XRD measurements were carried out using a device mounted on a high-gloss rotating 
anode, Rigaku RU-200BH, the anode being made of Cu. A reflective focusing optic, OSMIC, mainly 
transmits the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a very small part of the Kβ, the latter being absorbed 
completely  by  a  Ni  filter.  The  detector  used  is  2D,  flat  image  type,  model  Mar345.  For  these 
measurements, the working power was 50 kV and 50 mA and the beam size was 0.5 × 0.5 mm2. XRD 
patterns were collected from quartz capillary containing crushed samples.  

DSC. A Netzsch ST409PC was used at a 2 °C min-1 rate and with 60 and 20 mL min-1 N2 flows on 
the  SiC  heating  element  and  on  the  microbalance  respectively.  The  device  was  temperature-  and 
sensitivity-calibrated with the following standards: In, Sn, Bi, Pb, Zn. Samples were weighted with a 
Sartorius LA230S balance (0.1 mg precision) and placed in Netzsch Al crucibles (6.239.2-64.5.01 
and .02). DSC measurements were first made on an empty crucible to establish a baseline, then on a 
crucible with 15.1 mg of Al and a crucible with 36.65 mg of PbO2. The specific heat capacity of PbO2 
was then calculated according to equation 4, with Cp values for Al given by Hrbek [93].

Total reflectance spectroscopy. The UV-Visible-NIR spectroscopic measurements were performed 
on a Shimadzu UV-2600i spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (ISR-2600+) (1 nm 
step, 0.5 s nm-1). 

Spectrocolorimetry. A RUBY spectrocolorimeter was used to acquire the specular reflectance spectra 
in the [400; 800] nm of the samples placed 80 mm away from the detector. A Labsphere certified 
white  reflectance  standard  (USRS-99-010  AS-01158-060,  serial  number:  99A10-0513-9483)  was 
used as the white reference and a black cardboard was used as the black reference. 100 spectra of the 
references and of the samples were acquired with a 10 nm step at a 840 Hz rate and averaged. The 
software  automatically  calculates  the  colorimetric  coordinates  in  the  CIE  1964  space  with  a  D65 
illuminant.  Note  that  this  spectrocolorimeter  is  designed  to  measure  colour  differences  between 
samples analysed together. 

Microscopy. An Olympus SZX7 stereo microscope equipped with a UC30 camera run by the Stream 
Basic software was used to take pictures of the samples 

XRD. A Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer has been used in the θ – 2θ mode, with a 0.01° step and 
1 s/step. The X-ray source is a Co anticathode (λ = 1.789 Å) operated in the following conditions: 
40 keV / 35 mA. 

Temperature measurement. During laser irradiation experiments, the temperature was measured with 
a  FLIR  SC640  IR  camera  equipped  with  a  T197089  (f = 38 mm)  objective,  operated  by  the 
ThermaCam software and located 50 cm away from the sample. Its spectral measurement range is 
[7.5; 13] µm. Filmed in these conditions, a 1 cm pellet results in a 35 pixels diameter circular area. 
Reported accuracy is 2 °C or 2 % of measured temperature. 

Gaussian-shaped  1080 nm  laser  experimental  setup.  Most  of  the  experiment  were  made  with  a 
1080 nm diode laser. A fibered Manlight ML50 CWR-TKS laser, of peak wavelength 1080 nm, was 
used together  with  a Schlumberger 4433 periodical  signal generator.  The laser was used  either in 
continuous  mode. A beam  splitter  was occasionally used to  decrease the  beam  power,  which was 
controlled with a Fieldmate laser power meter and a Coherent powermax PM30 and ranged from a 
few 0.1 W to a few W. Beam power is measured after stabilization, with an estimated accuracy of 
0.05 W.  Lenses  were  occasionally  used  to  increase  or  decrease  the  beam  radius.  A  Spiricon  laser 
beam  profiler  was  previously  used  to  determine  the  Gaussian-shaped  beam  radius,  which  was 
1740 ± 30 µm at 1/e of peak intensity [94]. Samples were irradiated for 1 s to 120 s.

Ar+, FAP-S and Nd:YAG laser. In order to investigate the influence of the irradiation wavelength and 
beam profile, other CW laser were investigated. Their characteristics are summarized in table S-1. 
Laser power emission curves versus current were ascertained through recurrent measurements using 
a Powermax 500A laser power meter. Quasi-parallel, circularly symmetric laser beam were obtained 
using  a  set  of  optical  devices,  including  both  converging  and  diverging  lenses,  diaphragms  and 
mirrors. Beam power density profiles were established using a Gentec Beamage CCD13 analyzer. 
20 

 
 
 
For the Nd:YAG laser, a quasi “top-hat” energy profile was obtained, while Ar+ beam profile was 
measured as near-Gaussian (figure S-1). 

Figure S-1: radial power density profiles of the Ar+, top-hat Nd:YAG and FAP-S diode laser beams. 

Gaseous flux during laser irradiation. Expended carbon dioxide from the bottle, occasionally bubbled 
through distilled water, was directed at the sample, the latter and the nozzle spaced 5 cm apart. The 
estimated  flux  was  10 L min-1  for  CO2  alone  and  2 L min-1  for  CO2/H2O.  Note  that  at  ambient 
temperature, the vapour pressure of water is limited to 2348.6 Pa, that is 2.32 % in mole fraction [95]. 

Raman  microspectroscopy.  Micro-Raman  spectra  of  representative  areas  were  collected  using  a 
Renishaw InVia system, equipped with a GaAs diode laser source (785 nm). For individual particles 
observed under 1000× microscope, both confocal and pinhole diaphragm accessories were used so 
that no external signal was detected. Measurement parameters were selected so that no further photo-
thermal degradation occur during spectral acquisition [46].

Figure S-7: powder X-ray diffraction patterns of raw plattnerite sample before (β-PbO2) and after 
calcinations at 728K during 6 hours (Pb3O4). Initial plattnerite particles show typical coherent 
domains sizes between 0.8 and 1.5 µm while treated plattnerite particles, consisting of minium 
crystallites, have notably smaller sizes, [0.1; 1.5] µm (table S-7).

Figure S-10: visible total reflectance spectra of standard minium (Pb3O4) and plattnerite (β-PbO2). 
These spectra were collected on thick powder layers using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrometer 
equipped with a 60 mm integrating sphere. 

Figure  S-11:  Raman  spectra  of  raw  plattnerite  pellet  after  laser  irradiation  test  using  a  Gaussian 
shaped  CW  Ar+  laser  at  a  370 kW m-2  irradiance.  Spectra  were  acquired  in  the  outer  area  (a, 
characteristic bands of minium Pb3O4) and in the central area (b, characteristic bands of massicot β-
PbO).
