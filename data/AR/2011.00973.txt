Abstract   This brief review will discuss the current knowledge on the origin and 

evolution of the nitrogen atmospheres of the icy bodies in the solar system, partic-

ularly of Titan, Triton and Pluto. An important tool to analyse and understand the 

origin  and  evolution  of  these  atmospheres  can  be  found  in  the  different  isotopic 

signatures of their atmospheric constituents. The 14N/15N ratio of the N2-dominated 

atmospheres of these bodies serve as a footprint of the building blocks from which 

Titan, Triton and Pluto originated and of the diverse fractionation processes that 

shaped these atmospheres over their entire evolution. Together with other measured 

isotopic and elemental ratios such as  12C/13C or Ar/N these atmospheres can give 

2  

important insights into the history of the icy bodies in the solar system, the diverse 

processes that affect their N2-dominated atmospheres, and the therewith connected 

solar activity evolution. Titan’s gaseous envelope most likely originated from am-

monia ices with possible contributions from refractory organics. Its isotopic signa-

tures can yet be seen in the – compared to Earth – comparatively heavy 14N/15N ratio 

of 167.7, even though this value slightly evolved over its history due to atmospheric 

escape and photodissociation of N2. The origin and evolution of Pluto’s and Triton’s 

tenuous nitrogen atmospheres remain unclear, even though it might be likely that 

their atmospheres originated from the protosolar nebula or from comets. An in-situ 

space mission to Triton such as the recently proposed Trident mission, and/or to the 

ice giants would be a crucial cornerstone for a better understanding of the origin 

and evolution of the icy bodies in the outer solar system and their atmospheres in 

general. Due to the importance of the isotopic measurements for understanding the 

origin and evolution of the icy bodies in the solar system, this review will also give 

a brief discussion on the diverse measurement techniques with a focus on nitrogen. 

1 Introduction 

Only a small fraction of the more than 190 satellites in the solar system are cur-

rently known to have tenuous atmospheres (see e.g., Coustenis et al., 2010). These 

atmospheres are dominated by different species such as oxygen at Europa (Hall et 

al., 1995, 1998) or Ganymede (Noll et al., 1996; Hall et al., 1998; Feldman et al., 

2000), CO2 (Carlson, 1999), CO, O2, O and C in Callisto’s exosphere (Vorburger et 

al., 2019), water vapor at Enceladus (Dougherty et al., 2006), SO2 at Io (Pearl et al., 

1979; Lellouch et al., 2007) or tenuous nitrogen atmospheres at Triton and Pluto 

(Smith et al. 1989; Gladstone et al. 2016; Gladstone and Young 2019; Hart 1974). 

Among all known satellites in the solar system only Titan has a thick atmosphere 

with nitrogen as its main constituent. This makes Titan, Triton and Pluto the only 

icy bodies in the solar system with an N2-dominated atmosphere. 

3 

Besides these icy bodies, only Earth’s atmosphere is in addition dominated by 

nitrogen which likely originated from chondritic meteorites (Marty, 2012; Harries 

et al., 2015). The origin – but also the evolution – of N2 within the atmospheres of 

the icy bodies might be a different one. An indication for this can be found in the 

isotopic signature of N2 which gives clues on the origin and evolution of the respec-

tive  atmospheres.  While  Earth’s  atmospheric  nitrogen  has  an  isotopic  ratio  of 

14N/15N ~ 272 (Marty and Zimmermann, 1999; see also Table 1; Füri et al., 2015), 

which is close to chondritic, Titan’s value is 167.7 ± 0.3 (Niemann et al., 2010); for 

Pluto and Triton this is currently unknown. The difference between the terrestrial 

and Titan’s 14N/15N ratio can be explained either by different building blocks or by 

fractionation processes that changed the respective ratios over time – or by both.

There are several primordial nitrogen reservoirs in the solar system with distinct 

14N/15N  ratios  from  which  the  building  blocks  of  Titan’s  –  and  of  Triton’s  and 

Pluto’s – N2-atmosphere might have originated (see also Table 1). These reservoirs 

include  

i) 

chondrites (e.g., Kerridge, 1985; Alexander et al., 2012), the likely re-

servoir  of  the  terrestrial  nitrogen  (Marty  and  Zimmermann,  1999; 

Marty, 2012),  

ii) 

the solar wind and Jupiter, which are believed to represent N2 within 

the protosolar nebula (e.g., Meibom et al., 2007; Marty et al., 2010),  

iii) 

ammonia ices (Rousselot et al., 2014; Shinnaka  et al., 2014a, 2016a; 

Shinnaka  and  Kawakita,  2016),  cyanide  (CN)  and  hydrogen  cyanide 

(HCN;  e.g.,  Bockelée-Morvan  et  al.,  2008;  Manfroid  et  al.,  2009)  in 

comets, and  

iv) 

complex  refractory  organics  which  are  observed  in  cometary  grains 

(e.g., K. D. McKeegan et al., 2006; De Gregorio et al., 2010), interplan-

etary dust particles  (IDPs; e.g., Messenger, 2000; Aléon et al., 2003; 

Kevin D. McKeegan et al., 2006; Busemann et al., 2009), and as insol-

uble organic matter (IOM) in primitive chondrites (e.g., Aléon, 2010; 

Alexander et al., 2017). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Since organic matter, however, is the main carrier of nitrogen within chondrites 

(e.g., Aléon, 2010), these may not be classified as an independent reservoir but as 

an admixture of organics with another nitrogen-bearing reservoir. 

By reconstructing the initial fractionation of Titan’s building blocks one can de-

termine the specific reservoir(s) out of which Titan’s N2 originated. Various pro-

cesses, however, can fractionate isotopic ratios and must be considered to determine 

the initial 14N/15N ratio of a satellite or a planet. While in the specific case of Earth 

biological, geological, and anthropogenic processes are also fractionating nitrogen, 

it is expected that the main drivers for fractionation on the icy bodies are  

i) 

atmospheric escape  (Lammer et al., 2002; Lammer and Bauer, 2003; 

Kathleen E. Mandt et al., 2009; Mandt et al., 2014) and  

ii) 

photochemical processes such as photodissociation of N2 (Liang et al., 

2007;  Krasnopolsky,  2016),  even  though  this  process  might  be  more 

important on Titan than on Pluto (Mandt et al., 2017).

While  atmospheric  escape  preferentially  removes  the  lighter  isotope  from  the 

atmosphere (see also Lammer et al. (2020), this issue, and Lammer et al. (2008) for 

a review on fractionation by atmospheric escape), photolysis of N2 preferentially 

removes the heavier isotope (Liang et al., 2007). All these processes must be taken 

into account to gain insights into the origin and evolution of the nitrogen dominated 

atmospheres of Titan, Triton and Pluto. This brief review will mainly focus on these 

aspects while discussing the current knowledge of the nitrogen atmospheres around 

these icy bodies. In Section 2, we will further review different measurement tech-

niques for obtaining the isotopic composition of nitrogen throughout the solar sys-

tem,  since  its  measurement  accuracy  –  and  our  therewith  derived  scientific 

knowledge from these icy bodies – strongly relies on the involved technology. Sec-

tion 3 will discuss Titan’s nitrogen atmosphere and Section 4 will give an overview 

on the tenuous atmospheres of Pluto and Triton. A discussion and conclusion final-

ize the review.

2 Nitrogen Isotopes Measurement Techniques 

The isotopic ratio of 14N/15N on Titan was long believed to be around 60 – 70 as 

determined through remote measurements of HCN in its atmosphere (Marten et al., 

1997, 2002; Gurwell, 2004). However, as the space mission Cassini-Huygens has 

subsequently  illustrated,  the  isotopic  ratio  of  Titan’s  N2  cannot  be  derived  ade-

quately by just measuring nitrogen-bearing molecules such as HCN. This further 

exemplifies the difficulties in determining isotopic ratios of N2 throughout the Solar 

System. It is, therefore, crucial to comprehend how these isotopic ratios were ob-

tained, what are its measurement methods and the difficulties connected with these 

techniques. These will be addressed in this chapter. 

Determining the abundance and ratio of the stable isotopes of nitrogen, 14N and 

15N, throughout the solar system can principally be performed either through mass 

spectrometry or high-resolution spectroscopy ranging from the optical up to sub-

millimetre wavelengths. Measurements of these ratios for different N-bearing mol-

ecules, including the involved  measurement techniques for different solar system 

bodies, are illustrated in Fig. 1. 

In case of mass spectrometry, the instrument has either to be transported to the 

target or the target to a laboratory on Earth. Besides a few sample return missions 

(e.g., Kallenbach et al., 1998; McKeegan et al., 2006; Marty et al., 2011) or inves-

tigations  of  primitive  meteorites  (e.g.,  Kerridge,  1985;  Busemann  et  al.,  2006; 

Alexander et al., 2007; Alexander, 2011) and IDPs (e.g., Messenger, 2000; Floss et 

al., 2006; Busemann et al., 2009) that, among other research questions, also inves-

tigated the nitrogen isotopic composition of its target, mass spectrometers will have 

to be adopted to be suitable for transportation to the sample, such as the nitrogen-

dominated atmosphere of Titan. The respective instrument has to be miniaturized 

from its complex laboratory setup to the small-sized, low-weight requirements of a 

planetary  mission,  thereby  inevitably  reducing  its  sensitivity  and  resolution  (for 

reviews on mass spectrometry in planetary sciences see e.g., Palmer and Limero, 

2001; Ireland, 2013; Ren et al., 2018; Yokota, 2018; McIntyre et al., 2019; Arevalo 

et al., 2020). 

8  

Consequently,  mass  interferences  between  different  isotopologues  of  similar 

mass significantly complicate the determination of isotopic ratios and increase its 

error bars. The Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer (GPMS; Niemann et al., 1992), a 

quadrupole  mass  spectrometer  (see  e.g.,  Arevalo  et  al.,  2020,  for  a  thorough 

description of different types of mass spectrometers adopted for space missions), 

measured the  Jovian  14N/15N ratio from the doubly charged  14NH3

++ and  15NH3

++ 

signals (see also Fig. 1) at 9 and 8.5 m/z, since H2

16O  at 18 m/z interfered with 

15NH3

+, making a measurement through 14NH3

+ and 15NH3

+ not possible (Wong et 

al., 2004). Similarly, the Mars Science Laboratory SAM/Quadrupole Mass Spec-

trometer (QMS; Mahaffy et al., 2012) could not infer the Martian 14N/15N through 

direct atmospheric experiments from N2

+ due to interferences of CO+ ions from CO2 

but only from N+ ions or through enrichment experiments where CO2 and H2O were 

removed by chemical scrubbers (Wong et al., 2013). 

However,  in-situ  mass  spectrometry,  besides  sample  return,  nevertheless  pro-

vides the most accurate means for direct measuring of nitrogen isotopes on distant 

solar system bodies, if the instrument’s  resolution allows to bypass interferences, 

and its sensitivity for a detection of the less abundant isotopologue. Another inac-

curacy introduced by mass spectrometry might be coming from the spatial area of 

the measurement, i.e. where the measurements were performed. The Ion and Neu-

tral  Mass  Spectrometer  (INMS)  of  Cassini  (Waite  et  al.,  2004)  determined  the 

14N/15N ratio at Titan by crossings through its tenuous upper atmosphere above the 

homopause. Due to diffusive separation between the lighter and heavier isotopes 

above the well-mixed lower atmosphere, the measured values (Waite et al., 2005) 

from  Cassini/INMS  of  14N/15N = 188−16
sums of the measured abundances below 1230 km, and   14N/15N = 214 ± 1, as re-

+14,  as  determined  through  the  integrated 

trieved through mass deconvolution of the average spectra between  the height of 

1230 and 1180 km, must be extrapolated to the surface, thereby necessarily intro-

ducing  further  inaccuracies.  Waite  et  al.  (2005)  extrapolated  these  values  to  be 

14N/15N = 168 – 211 on Titan’s surface, while Mandt et al. (2009) estimated the sur-

face value based on Cassini/INMS data to be 14N/15N = 148 ± 7.5. 

9 

Another  instrument  on-board  Cassini-Huygens,  the  Gas-Chromatograph  Mass 

Spectrometer (GCMS; Niemann et al., 2002) measured the value directly at the sur-

face  to  preliminarily  be  14N/15N = 183 ± 5  directly  from  molecular  nitrogen 

(Niemann et al., 2005). This was later re-evaluated to 167.7 ± 0.6 due to a refined 

instrument calibration (Niemann et al., 2010) and is now considered as the standard-

value for Titan’s atmosphere.

Another possibility for in-situ determination of isotopic ratios is the highly-sen-

sitive Tunable Laser Spectroscopy (TLS) which is currently part of the SAM instru-

ment-suite (Mahaffy et al., 2012) on-board of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). 

TLS  provides  sensitivities  of  ≈1‰  for  planetary  low-mass  instruments  (e.g., 

Webster et al., 2014) and works through spectroscopy in the IR region with a tuna-

ble diode laser light source that can be tuned over the specific molecular absorption 

line  wavelengths  of  interest,  thereby  being  absorbed  by  the  respective  molecule. 

While this method is well suited for the characterization of H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, or 

O3, and indeed recorded high-precision stable isotope ratios on Mars for hydrogen, 

oxygen and carbon isotopes (e.g., Webster et al., 2013), it is less appropriate for the 

characterization  of  N2.  Molecular  nitrogen  does  not  show  significant  absorption 

lines in the IR region (e.g., Lofthus and Krupenie, 1977). However, TLS is princi-

pally also suited to observe NO, NO2, HNO3, and NH3 (Webster et al., 2014) and 

was already proposed for a mission to Titan (Webster et al., 1990), and, more re-

cently, to Venus (Webster et al., 2015). 

That molecular nitrogen only shows very weak absorption lines is also a problem 

for  spectroscopic  observations  from  ground  and  space,  since  spectroscopic  tech-

niques that are normally used to measure other isotopic ratios cannot be applied to 

N2. This also prohibits a remote determination of the 14N/15N ratio in Titan’s atmos-

phere through spectroscopic observations of N2. However, other nitrogen-bearing 

molecules show spectral features and can be observed from Earth and from space, 

which has been performed in the past for several different molecular species in Ti-

tan’s atmosphere, as can be seen in Table 2. 

Depending on the molecule, fingerprints of nitrogen can be observed in the op-

tical, such as the molecules NH2, a primer for NH3 (Rousselot et al., 2014; Shinnaka 

et al., 2014a, 2016a; Shinnaka and Kawakita, 2016) and CN (Arpigny et al., 2003; 

Jehin  et  al.,  2004,  2009;  Hutsemékers  et  al.,  2005;  Manfroid  et  al.,  2005,  2009; 

Bockelée-Morvan et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2018; Moulane et al., 2020) as both ob-

served  for  different  comets,  HCN  (Vinatier  et  al.,  2007,  for  Titan)  and  NH3 

(Encrenaz et al., 1978; Tokunaga et al., 1979; Fouchet et al., 2000, 2004; Abbas et 

 
11 

al., 2004; Fletcher et al., 2014, all for Jupiter) in the infrared, and HCN, HC3N, and 

CHC3N for Titan (Marten et al., 1997, 2002; Gurwell, 2004; Courtin et al., 2011; 

Molter et al., 2016; Cordiner et al., 2018; Iino et al., 2020) and for comets (Jewitt et 

al., 1997; Ziurys et al., 1999; Bockelée-Morvan et al., 2008; Biver et al., 2016) in 

the sub- to millimetre wavelength range. 

A few space-bourne measurements of some of these molecules have been per-

formed from afar and through flybys. During the latter, Cassini’s Composite Infra-

red Spectrometer (CIRS; Flasar et al., 2004) performed measurements on HCN at 

Titan (Vinatier et al., 2007) and NH3 at Jupiter (Abbas et al., 2004; Fouchet et al., 

2004). These were the only successful attempts so far to determine nitrogen isotopic 

ratios in-situ with spacecraft instrumentation. For Saturn, Cassini/CIRS was unable 

to determine 14N/15N through NH3. Due to the giant planet’s lower atmospheric tem-

perature and the dominance of phosphine in its atmosphere in the mid-infrared, the 

sensitivity requirements were too high for Cassini/CIRS (e.g., Fletcher et al., 2014). 

Other space-based spectroscopic determinations of 14N/15N were performed from 

the distance; infrared observations of NH3 at Jupiter by Fouchet et al. (2000) with 

ISO-SWS (De Graauw et al., 1996) and submillimetre observations of HCN with 

Herschel-SPIRE  (Griffin  et  al.,  2010)  by  Courtin  et  al.  (2011).  Several  different 

measurements of 14N/15N ratios on a diverse set of solar system bodies were addi-

tionally performed from the ground. While ground-based instrumentation has the 

advantage of not having the need to be miniaturized as for a space-based detector, 

interferences and low transmission rates due to e.g. H2O and O3 in the Earth’s at-

mosphere, as well as  local weather conditions, complicate  observations from the 

ground. However, the first determination of the 14N/15N ratio in Titan’s atmosphere 

was performed with the IRAM 30-m telescope (Baars et al., 1987) by Marten et al. 

(1997), who measured the ratio in HCN to be 14N/15N = 65 ± 15. This was later re-

fined by Marten et al. (2002) to 14N/15N = 65 ± 5, which was made possible due to 

higher sensitivity observations with upgraded receivers and a renewed IRAM 30-m 

telescope, but also due to a better position of Saturn in the sky as for their previous 

observations. 

12  

At the time of these measurements, the nitrogen isotopic ratio of HCN was ex-

pected to represent Titan’s atmospheric N2 as well. While other subsequent obser-

vations of HCN by Gurwell (2004) more or less confirmed the results of Marten et 

al. (2002), preliminary measurements of Cassini-Huygens/GCSM found an 14N/15N 

ratio  for N2 that  was much higher, i.e.  14N/15N = 183 ± 5 (Niemann et al., 2005). 

This discrepancy was later to be resolved by photolytic fractionation of 14N14N and 

14N15N (Liang et al., 2007) from N2, which leads to a preferential incorporation of 

15N into HCN, thereby explaining the different isotopic ratios of N2 and HCN, one 

of its daughter products. 

This, however, also illustrates the difficulty to determine the ratio of 14N and 15N 

in N2 through measurements of other molecules such as HCN, CN, or NH2, which 

all show lower  14N/15N ratios than molecular nitrogen. Further problems in deter-

mining isotopic ratios from spectral observations come from missing experimental 

determinations of the spectral lines of particularly the less abundant isotopes (e.g., 

Rousselot et al., 2014), but also from theoretical models that are needed to translate 

emission lines into abundances and isotopic ratios. Derived atmospheric tempera-

ture profiles, for instance, significantly influence emission lines and the subsequent 

determination of isotopic abundances. Gurwell (2004) retrieved two slightly diverg-

ing values for the  14N/15N ratio in Titan’s HCN due to the usage of different tem-

perature profiles. They determined 14N/15N to be 94 ± 13 for a profile provided by 

Coustenis  and  Bezard  (1995),  and  14N/15N = 72 ± 9  for  another  one  by  Lellouch 

(1990). 

Furthermore, observations of the 14N/15N ratio in ammonia ices in comets only 

became possible due to experimental determination of the 15NH2 emission lines by 

Rousselot  et  al.  (2014),  which  serves  as  proxy  for  the  very  faint  lines  of  15NH3. 

Likewise, the fractionation between HCN and N2 could have only been determined 

due to quantum-mechanical advances in the computation of isotopic photoabsorp-

tion and photodissociation cross sections of N2 (Liang et al., 2007). This fractiona-

tion process further turns out to be dependent on the incident EUV flux (Mandt et 

al., 2017). 

13 

These examples demonstrate the difficulties for determining accurate 14N/15N ra-

tios for any N-bearing molecules but in particular for N2 through the extrapolation 

from CN, HCN, or NH2. It also provides good arguments for in-situ measurements 

with mass spectrometers or for sample return missions, such as the Stardust mission 

(McKeegan et al., 2006; De Gregorio et al., 2010), or Genesis (Marty et al., 2011). 

The latter returned a sample of solar wind N+ ions to be analysed via a high-preci-

sion  technique  called  secondary  ionization  mass  spectrometry  (SIMS;  see  e.g., 

Schaepe  et  al.,  2019,  for  an  introduction  into  this  technique)  at  the  Cameca 

1280HR2 instrument at CRPG Nancy (Marty et al., 2011), and confirmed the highly 

14N-enriched (proto-)solar reservoir out of which Jupiter accreted its nitrogen. The 

sample return of the Stardust mission from comet 81P/Wild 2 confirmed the exist-

ence of nitrogen-bearing insoluble organic matter in cometary dust (McKeegan et 

al. 2006). This was as well investigated with the SIMS technique, but by the na-

noSIMS instrument of the Washington University in St. Louis. Another high preci-

sion  measurement  technique, the  so-called  sector-type mass  spectrometry,  which 

either uses a static electric or a magnetic sector, or a combination of both, to retrieve 

high resolution and reproducibility measurements, was applied on the ground for 

analyzing noble gases in the Genesis targets (e.g., Meshik et al., 2014, 2020), and 

for analyzing Martian atmospheric nitrogen and noble gases trapped in Martian me-

teorites with high precision, supplementing the in-situ measurements done by the 

Viking and the MSL mass spectrometers  (e.g., Becker and Pepin, 1984; Cassata, 

2017). This technique was further also applied for determining the evolution of at-

mospheric xenon and other noble gas isotopes over the Earth’s Archean eon (see, 

Avice et al., 2018; Avice and Marty, 2020, this issue). 

As this overview of different measurement techniques for the determination  of 

the 14N/15N ratios of diverse solar system bodies illustrates, one must be cautious in 

extrapolating a specific measurement to another species or even solar system body. 

While there are already several determinations of 14N/15N existing for different mo-

lecular species at Titan, these results cannot simply be generalized to isotopic nitro-

gen ratios at Triton and Pluto. As the following chapters will show, determining 

14  

their isotopic ratios independently in the future will be crucial for better understand-

ing the origin and evolution of their nitrogen atmospheres.  

3 Titan 

Saturn’s large satellite Titan (Fig. 2; Table 1 and 2) is the only moon in the solar 

system with a substantial gaseous envelope, and besides Earth the only body with a 

thick N2-dominated atmosphere. It has a surface pressure of 1.5 bar and consists of 

Fig. 2. Cassini image of Saturn’s moon Titan (Courtesy NASA/JPL/University of Arizona).  

98.4% N2 and 1.5% CH4 in the lower stratosphere  (Niemann et al., 2010); at the 

surface  the  methane  fraction  even  rises  up  to  5.7%  (Samuelson  et  al.,  1997; 

Niemann et al., 2010). While the existence of  its atmosphere was first suggested 

already  in  1908  (Solá,  1908)  and  proven  in  1944  via  the  discovery  of  methane  

(Kuiper, 1944), N2 being its main constituent was not confirmed until the flybys of 

Voyager 1 and 2 in the early 1980s (Broadfoot et al. 1981; Lindal et al. 1983; Hunten 

et al., 1984; Vervack et al. 2004) due to the challenging detection and confirmation 

of N2 (see Section 2).  

 
 
15 

The origin of nitrogen in Titan’s atmosphere, however, is still a matter of debate 

(Niemann et al., 2010) with its most likely sources being proposed to be either N2 

or NH3 (e.g. Strobel, 1982). Lewis (1971), who first suggested that Titan possesses 

a thick N2-atmosphere, proposed that it accreted from NH3, i.e. ammonia, during the 

formation of the moon. This ammonia was then either decomposed to N2 via pho-

tolysis (Lewis, 1971; Atreya et al., 1978) or impact-induced chemistry (McKay et 

al., 1988; Ishimaru et al., 2011; Sekine et al., 2011), or outgassed  as N2 through 

thermal  decomposition  from  Titan’s  interior  (Glein  et  al.,  2009;  Glein,  2015).  If 

NH3 might have been efficiently altered to N2 via impacts into an early ammonium 

hydrate rich crust (Sekine et al., 2011), such impacts would have also led to signif-

icant atmospheric erosion (Marounina et al., 2015). 

As described in Section 2, first measurements of Titan’s atmospheric  14N/15N-

ratio (see Table 2) suggested a strong enrichment of 15N by about 4.5 times (Marten 

et al., 1997; Lunine et al., 1999) compared to the terrestrial atmospheric value of 

~272 (Marty and Zimmermann, 1999). Since the conversion processes of NH3 to 

N2 could not have significantly altered the 14N/15N-ratio (Berezhnoi, 2010), it was 

proposed that, in case Titan’s atmosphere would have the same building blocks than 

the Earth’s atmospheric nitrogen, this enrichment might indicate strong atmospheric 

loss  of  N2,  most  likely  through  atmospheric  escape  early  in  Titan’s  history  (e.g. 

Lunine et al., 1999; Lammer et al., 2000, 2008; Penz et al., 2005). These results also 

suggested that Titan's volatile inventory was accreted at least partially from the Sa-

turnian  subnebula  which  was  more  reducing  than  the  surrounding  solar  nebula 

(Lunine et al., 1999). The 14N/15N-ratio, however, was more precisely measured by 

the Cassini-Huygens/GCMS to be 167.7 (see Tables 1 and 2; Niemann et al., 2010) 

16  

which was found to be close to the 14N/15N-ratios of cometary ammonia (Rousselot 

et al., 2014; Shinnaka et al., 2014, 2016).  

As has been shown by Mandt et al. (2009, 2014) atmospheric loss through hy-

drodynamic escape, sputtering and Jeans escape cannot explain the strong enrich-

ment  of  15N  in  Titan’s  atmosphere  compared  to  the  terrestrial  value,  since  all  of 

these processes would have required a longer duration than the existence of the solar 

system for fractionating Titan’s value from 272 to 167.7. Mandt et al. (2014) there-

fore concluded that the most likely source of Titan’s N2-atmosphere must have been 

ammonia  ices  with  an  initial  ratio  of  <190  (see  Fig.  3).  This  result  was  recently 

Fig. 3. Different attempts to reproduce the initial 14N/15N-fractionation of Titan. While older 
studies like Lunine et al (1999) or Penz et al. (2005) attempted to reproduce the terrestrial 
fractionation (i.e. ~273) and therefore yielded unrealistically high losses, newer studies cal-
culated the loss through time to yield a maximum initial fractionation. The grey shaded area 
most likely represents the initial ratios. 

confirmed by a new study of Erkaev et al. (2020) who applied a hydrodynamic up-

per atmosphere model (Erkaev et al., 2015) that solves the equations of mass, mo-

mentum and energy for Titan’s N2-atmosphere under different EUV-fluxes from the 

young Sun. These authors found that depending on the solar EUV evolution, the 

14N/15N-ratio of Titan’s atmosphere could have only been fractionated by thermal 

and  non-thermal  atmospheric  escape  and  photochemical  processes  at  maximum

from an initial value of 

167 for a weakly active 

(i.e.  a  so-called  “slow 

rotator”)  to  172  for  a 

moderately  active,  and 

185  for  a  highly  active 

(fast 

rotating)  young 

Sun  according  to  Tu  et 

al. (2015). The total loss 

of  nitrogen  to  space,  if 

one  assumes  that  Ti-

tan’s  atmosphere  origi-

nated ~4.5 Gyr ago, var-

ies significantly in their 

study. While for a slow 

and moderate rotator the 

total  loss  would  only 

have been ~0.6 bar, and 

~2 bar,  respectively,  it 

would have increased to

~16 bar for a fast rotating Sun (Erkaev et al. 2020). For high EUV fluxes, a nitrogen-

dominated atmosphere with negligible abundances of CO2 will start to rapidly ex-

pand and hydrodynamically escape to space (see e.g., Erkaev et al. 2020; Johnstone 

et al. 2019; Tian et al. 2009). To experience such a behaviour, the irradiation onto 

Titan’s atmosphere must have reached values of above 100 times the present-day 

EUV flux (Erkaev et al. 2020). Even though the young Sun most probably reached 

such high values very early in its history for a few million years, only a fast rotating 

Sun could have maintained these high fluxes for a significant period of time (Tu et 

al. 2015; Güdel et al. 2020; this issue).  

Fig. 4a shows the exobase altitudes of Titan’s nitrogen atmosphere for different 

solar EUV fluxes for a slow, moderate and fast rotator, respectively, as simulated

with the model of Erkaev et 

al. (2020); Fig. 4b shows the 

related  cumulative  loss  in 

Titan’s  nitrogen 

atmos-

pheres  over  time.  Contrary 

to 

the  present-day, 

for 

which sputtering is the dom-

inant  loss  process,  thermal 

escape  would  have  clearly 

dominated  early  in  Titan’s 

history (with escape rates up 

to 1030 s-1 for 400 EUV), in 

case that its nitrogen-domi-

nated  atmosphere  was  al-

ready present at that time.  

If, however, the proposed 

endogenic  origin  of  Titan’s 

atmosphere through decom-

position  of  NH3  and  subse-

quent  outgassing  as  N2,  as 

proposed by Glein (2015), is 

Fig.  5.  The  parameter  space  for  making  Titan’s 
nitrogen atmosphere according to Glein (2015) and, for 
a slow rotator, to Erkaev et al. (2020). Here it is assumed 
that  the  atmosphere  originated  endogenically  from 
geochemical  synthesis  of  NH3  into  N2  within  the  deep 
interior of Titan; ξN2 = 1 corresponds to 100% synthesis. 
The dashed lines illustrated limiting values according to 
Glein (2015) and slightly adopted by Erkaev et al. (2020) 
on the abundance of NH3 and the outgassing efficiency 
of  N2.  They  greyish  and  reddish  area  gives  the 
the  present-day 
parameter  space  within  which 
atmosphere  would  be  consistent  with  all  constraints. 
Glein (2015) did not include atmospheric escape into his 
model, while Erkaev et al. (2020) did. This reduces the 
parameter space for an initially outgassed atmosphere. 

substantially true, then the study of Erkaev et al. (2020) further suggests that either  

i) for a moderate to fast rotating young Sun the outgassing of Titan’s atmosphere 

did not start before 20-67 million years to 425-495 million years after the formation 

of the solar system, respectively, or  

ii) that the young Sun was a slow rotating young G-type star. 

 The reason for this is the following. Besides the outgassing efficiency ε, an im-

portant variable in the model of Glein (2015) is the so-called reaction progress var-

iable ξN2, which describes the yield of N2 from its precursor NH3. If ξN2 = 1 then all 

endogenic NH3 would have needed to be decomposed to N2 via 2NH3 → N2 + 3H2. 

Values higher than ξN2 = 1 are therefore clearly not possible (see Fig. 4). However, 

19 

if Titan’s atmosphere already started outgassing ~4.5 Gyr ago, the thermal escape 

produced by the strong EUV flux of a fast rotating Sun would have been so strong 

that ξN2 would have to be as high as up to ξN2 ~ 11. By considering the model of 

Glein (2015) and therefore  assuming an endogenic origin of Titan’s atmosphere, 

Erkaev et al. (2020) restricted the initial fractionation of 14N/15N to be <172, which 

is close to the present-day value and in agreement with an origin from ammonia ices 

(e.g. Mandt et al. 2014). The red, green, and blue shaded areas in Fig. 3b illustrate 

the earliest possible times for the outgassing of Titans nitrogen atmosphere for a 

slowly, moderately, and fast rotating young Sun according to Erkaev et al. (2020). 

It further has to be noted that some recent studies found that the Sun originated 

most likely as a slow to moderate rotating star (Odert et al., 2018; Saxena et al., 

2019; H. Lammer et al., 2020; e.g. Johnstone et al., 2020). Lammer et al. (2020) 

found that the present-day 36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne ratios in Venus and Earth’s at-

mosphere cannot be reproduced if the Sun originated as a moderate to fast rotator. 

In addition, another study by Johnstone et al. (2020) found that the terrestrial at-

mosphere would not have been stable during the Hadean and early Archean eons 

under the strong EUV flux of a fast rotating Sun, which is also in agreement with 

the work of Saxena et al.  (2019), who found that the Sun likely has been a slow 

rotator based on sodium and potassium constraints from the Lunar regolith. These 

findings indicate that the nitrogen atmosphere of Titan could theoretically have been 

outgassed already very early after the formation of the solar system and not only 

after about 500 million years as it would have been the case for a fast rotating young 

Sun (Erkaev et al. 2020). A later outgassing, however, is not excluded by this study. 

Another clue to the origin of Titan’s atmosphere can be drawn from the atmos-

pheric abundances of the noble gases (see e.g. Hörst, 2017). Since the ratio of 36Ar 

to 14N is orders of magnitudes below solar (Niemann et al., 2005, 2010), this is an 

indication that only an unsubstantial amount of N2 could have been accreted during 

the formation of the Saturnian moon, since  36Ar is trapped in ices at much colder 

temperatures than N2 (Bar-Nun et al., 1988; Owen and Bar-Nun, 1995; Niemann et 

al., 2005). However, aerosols in Titan’s atmosphere can trap 36Ar, which might re-

move enough 36Ar from its atmosphere over its lifetime to explain the present-day 

20  

36Ar/N2 ratio (Jacovi and Bar-Nun, 2008). But the existence of the radiogenic 40Ar 

in the atmosphere of Titan further suggests that outgassing from the interior played 

a major role in Titan’s history (Niemann et al., 2005) which might be another indi-

cation for a later origin of its atmosphere through outgassing from the interior. An 

origin from the protosolar nebula seems to also be confirmed by the CO-chemistry 

in Titan’s atmosphere (Hörst et al., 2008; Hörst, 2017 and references therein). Con-

cerning its age, interior models further indicate that major outgassing mainly took 

place during the last ~1 Gyr (Tobie et al., 2012, Castillo-Rogez and Lunine, 2010), 

which is supported by the  12C/13C ratio in CH4 (Mandt et al., 2012; Nixon et al., 

2012). 

Determining the noble gas abundances and its isotopic ratios should give further 

clues on whether Titan’s nitrogen originated from NH3 in its interior or from another 

source.  The  endogenic  model  by  Glein  (2015)  predicts  quite  specific  ratios  of 

20Ne/22Ne ≈ 8.9 and  36Ar/38Ar ≈ 5.3 based on their outgassing efficiencies and on 

their  potential  origin.  The  latter  was  tentatively  determined  by  the  Cassini-Huy-

gens/GCMS instrument (Niemann et al., 2010) to be ≈ 5,  (Niemann et al., 2010), 

but this will have to be confirmed by future missions. In a more recent article, Glein 

(2017) also speculates on a nebula origin of Titan’s Ne, which might  be another 

explanation  of  its  potentially  close-to  solar  22Ne/36Ar  ratio  of  about  (0.05 – 2.5) 

times the Sun’s value (Niemann et al., 2010), and would not be in contradiction with 

a non-solar origin of Titan’s nitrogen (Glein, 2017). other noble gas ratio could so 

far, however, not be measured at Titan. Abundances or ratios of noble gases in com-

ets, which could give another clue on the origin of Titan’s atmosphere, were by now 

not measured at all. 

Further isotopic measurements at Titan itself, can be performed by the upcoming 

Dragonfly mission, which arrives at the satellite in the mid-2030s to investigate its 

building blocks (Lorenz et al., 2018; Turtle et al., 2018). It consists of a lander that 

uses rotors for flying to different sites, and will carry on-board the Dragonfly Mass 

Spectrometer DraMS (Lorenz et al., 2018). This will perform Laser Desorption/ion-

ization Mass Spectrometry (LDMS) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry 

(GCMS) and uses elements of Curiosity’s SAM-suite (Mahaffy et al., 2012) and the 

21 

Exomars/MOMA instrument (Goesmann et al., 2017). Since this mission will also 

study Titan’s surface, it might be able to attain the  14NH3/15NH3 ratio in its ices, a 

crucial measurement for determining the origin of Titan’s atmospheric N2, an issue 

that is still not entirely settled. 

A recent study by Miller et al. (2019) proposes that accreted refractory organics 

may contribute up to 50% to Titan’s present-day atmosphere. They argue that the 

14N/15N-ratio of cometary ammonia (~136; Shinnaka et al. (2016)) is lower than in 

Titan’s atmosphere whereas cometary Ar/N2-ratios seem to be too high (Miller et 

al., 2019). Refractory organics on the other hand show higher mean 14N/15N-ratios 

(K. D. McKeegan et al., 2006) and lower mean Ar/N2-ratios (Lodders, 2010) than 

Titan’s  atmosphere.  Miller  et  al.  (2019)  therefore  conclude  that  the  isotopic  and 

noble gas constraints of Titan suggest NH3 together with refractory organics were 

the dominant sources for its atmospheric N2. They further conclude that this mixture 

may have been the result of an accretion of material from the warm Saturnian sub-

nebula followed by the heating of organics in Titan’s interior and a subsequently 

outgassing into the atmosphere. It also has to be noted that photochemical fraction-

ation,  which  tends  to  remove  the  heavier  isotope  from  the  atmosphere 

(Krasnopolsky, 2016), likely was not the reason for the fractionation from the com-

etary value to the present-day value according to Miller et al. (2019), since this pro-

cess can only be relevant with methane being abundant in the atmosphere. But me-

thane,  however,  might  have  been  depleted  in  Titan’s  atmosphere  early  on,  most 

likely as long as 1 Gyr ago or even longer (Yung et al., 1984; Mandt et al., 2012). 

Interior models (Tobie et al., 2006), on the other hand, also suggest earlier episodic 

outgassing of methane, so there could have been extended periods of methane in the 

atmosphere even before 1 Gyr ago which could have been a driver of photochemical 

fractionation. 

A further insight into the origin of Titan’s N2 might be revealed by a measure-

ment of the 14N/15N-ratio of N2 in Enceladus’ plumes (Glein et al., 2009) which is 

expected to originate from the oxidation of NH3 into N2 (Matson et al., 2007; Glein 

et  al.,  2008).  Since  N2  at  Enceladus  is  not  affected  by  fractionation  through 

22  

atmospheric  escape  this  might  also  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  initial 

14N/15N-ratio of Titan and hence of its origin (Glein et al., 2009). 

4 Pluto 

That Pluto (Fig. 6Fig. 6) possesses an atmosphere was suggested as early as 1974 

(Hart,  1974;  Golitsyn,  1975;  Cruikshank  and  Silvaggio,  1980;  Fink  et  al.,  1980; 

Trafton and Stern, 1983; Brosch, 1995) and confirmed via ground-based observa-

tions through stellar occultation’s in 1988 (Hubbard et al., 1988; Elliot et al., 1989). 

These and further studies (e.g. Young et al., 1997; Lellouch et al., 2011; Olkin et 

al., 2014; Bosh et al., 2015; Dias-Oliveira et al., 2015) showed that the main con-

stituent of its atmosphere was N2 which was recently confirmed by the New Hori-

zons space mission (Stern et al., 2015; Gladstone et al., 2016). Contrary to Titan, 

however, Pluto’s tenuous atmosphere only has a surface pressure of about 6-24 μbar 

depending on its orbital location (Young et al., 1997; Lellouch et al., 2011). But as 

for  Titan,  a  determination  of  Pluto’s  atmospheric  14N/15N-ratio  might  reveal  im-

portant hints on its origin (Jessup et al., 2013; Mandt et al., 2016). Observations 

with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of HC14N and a non-detection 

of HC15N in Pluto’s atmosphere provide a lower limit of 125 for  14N/15N in HCN 

(Lellouch et al., 2017).  Although a pre-New Horizons study by Mandt et al. (2016) 

showed that if Pluto’s nitrogen originated as N2 its ratio could not be lower than 324 

whereas it would be less than 154 if it would have been originated from ammonia. 

Updated work based on the observations made by New Horizons (Gladstone et al., 

2016;  Young  et  al.,  2018)  showed  that  the  uncertainties  in  how  condensation  of 

HCN fractionates the isotopes creates large uncertainties for how to interpret a cur-

rent ratio in N2 (Mandt et al., 2017). 

Due to the low gravity of Pluto it was expected that its atmospheric N2 would 

easily escape.  While it was debated whether this escape might be hydrodynamic 

(Krasnopolsky, 1999; Tian and Toon, 2005; Strobel, 2008) with loss rates of up to 

1027 – 1028 molecules s-1 (Tian and Toon, 2005; Zhu et al., 2014), or enhanced Jeans 

23 

escape (Tucker et al., 2011), New Horizons showed that its atmosphere is currently 

lost via Jeans escape with the loss rate being in the range of ~1023 molecules s−1. 

Based on the pre-New Horizons escape models, Singer and Stern (2015) suggested 

that Pluto’s N2 should be of endogenic origin, if the estimated escape rates would 

have been so high that cometary impacts could not have resupplied its atmospheric 

N2. In this case internal processes would be needed to outgas N2 from the interior 

into the atmosphere (Singer and Stern, 2015). A post-New Horizons model by Glein 

and Waite (2018) considered whether the reservoir of Pluto’s N2 might be of pri-

mordial origin for which they developed two different model approaches, i.e. i) a 

“cometary model” which assumes a composition similar to comets with trapped N2 

from the solar nebula, and ii) a “solar model” which assumes a solar abundances of 

N2. They found that, while their cometary model can account for the amount of N2 

stored in Sputnik Planitia, their solar model can provide such a large inventory of 

N2 that strong atmospheric escape could have been possible in the past. Glein and 

Waite  (2018)  therefore  conclude  that  the  origin  of  Pluto’s  nitrogen  inventory  is 

likely primordial, i.e. accreted early as N2 and might not originate from a secondary 

source. However, a solar as well as a cometary origin would result in a CO/N2 ratio 

being significantly higher than the atmospheric ratio as measured by New Horizons 

24  

and ALMA; Glein and Waite (2018) suggest a burial mechanism that depletes CO 

from Pluto’s atmosphere to solve this paradox.  

Even though New Horizons showed that the present-day escape rates are in the 

Jeans escape regime, it is important to determine whether the dominant escape pro-

cess over Pluto’s history was hydrodynamic or Jeans escape, as the studies of Singer 

and Stern (2015) and Glein and Waite (2018) illustrate. Since both processes frac-

tionate  very differently (e.g.  Volkov et al., 2011; Mandt et al., 2014), measuring 

Pluto’s atmospheric 14N/15N-ratio would be crucial to not only gain better insights 

into its origin but also into its escape mechanisms. In addition, constraining the ratio 

of  36Ar/N2  at  Pluto’s  surface  can  give  an  important  constraint  on  whether  its  N2 

really is primordial. A high amount of 36Ar would be consistent with the primordial

vey).  

hypothesis,  while  low  amounts  would  imply  an  origin  from  a  secondary  source 

(Glein and Waite 2018).  

Further interesting questions in view of the evolution of Pluto’s nitrogen atmos-

phere are how its escape and pressure vary over its elongated orbit. While the escape 

rate seems to change only by a factor of 2 (Tian and Toon, 2005), its atmosphere 

25 

might even collapse due to cooling on the outer parts of its orbit (e.g. Hansen et al. 

(2015)). From 1988 to 2002, however, its atmospheric pressure increased by a factor 

of  about  two  from  2.33 ± 0.24 μbar  at  𝑟 = 1215 km  in  1988  (Yelle  and  Elliot, 

1997) to 5.0 ± 0.6 μbar in 2002 (Sicardy et al., 2003) even though Pluto was re-

ceding from the Sun (Elliot et al., 2003; Sicardy et al., 2003). This effect might be 

due to Pluto’s volatile cycle which is not only determined by its distance from the 

Sun but also by its high obliquity and therefore its subsolar latitude as was predicted 

by Hansen and Paige (1996). Meza et al. (2019), who measured the surface pressure 

of Pluto through eleven stellar occultation events between 2002 and 2016, further 

reported a continuous increase in pressure of up to 12.04 ± 0.41 μbar at the surface 

in  2015  (compared  to  4.28 ± 0.44 μbar  in  1988)  and  6.92 ± 0.076 μbar  at  𝑟 =

1215 km. This rise is due to i) the heating of nitrogen ice in Sputnik Planitia and in 

the northern mid latitudes because of the direct insolation from the Sun, and ii) the 

orbital position of Pluto close to the Sun (Bertrand and Forget, 2016). 

5 Triton 

Neptune’s moon Triton (Fig. 6) also has a tenuous nitrogen-dominated atmos-

phere similar to Pluto’s. While the Voyager flyby of 1989 measured an N2-surface 

pressure of about 14  μbar (Gurrola, 1995), it has risen to  about 40  μbar in 2009 

(Lellouch et al., 2010). First models of the present-day thermal nitrogen escape rates 

at Triton estimated values in the range of 1024 – 1025 s-1 (Yung and Lyons, 1990; 

Summers  and  Strobel,  1991;  Lyons  et  al.,  1992;  Krasnopolsky  et  al.,  1993; 

Krasnopolsky and Cruikshank, 1995). Lammer (1995) found that non-thermal es-

cape  rates  via  sputtering  through  particles  within  the  magnetosphere  of  Neptune 

could also lead to comparable values in the order of 5 × 1024 s-1. These escape rates 

are about one to two orders higher than the thermal escape rates that New Horizons 

found at Pluto. If, for thermal escape, one considers the closer location to the Sun 

during the Voyager 2 flyby, on which most of the Triton models are based, then 

such  higher  escape  rates  might  indeed  be  likely.  Also  the value  for  sputtering  at 

26  

Triton seems reasonable if one compares it with Titan, for which the sputtering es-

cape  rate  is  estimated  to  be  around  3 − 4 × 1025  s-1  (Shematovich  et  al.,  2003; 

Michael et al., 2005). Within a more recent study, Strobel and Zhu (2017), however, 

modelled thermal escape rates from Triton’s atmosphere that would be significantly 

higher, i.e. about 2.6 x 1027 molecules s-1 which would also be orders of magnitudes 

higher than the escape from present-day Pluto’s atmosphere. Whether this is likely 

or not could be resolved by a new mission to the Ice Giants. 

As for Pluto, also in the case of Triton the atmospheric  14N/15N-ratio is yet un-

known and its origin unclear, but a similar source as Pluto’s nitrogen-dominated 

atmosphere might be likely. Glein and Waite (2018) speculate that if Triton formed 

from the same reservoir than Pluto, then the non-detection of CO2 at Pluto but its 

detection at Triton might be an indicator on some geochemical endowment or geo-

physical processes at Triton. The “solar model” by Glein and Waite (2018) interest-

ingly might also provide sufficient N2 for the idea of a massive early N2 atmosphere 

around Triton that could have been accreted from the protosolar or proto-Neptunian 

nebula, as suggested by Lunine and Nolan (1992). They proposed that the lifetime 

of such a thick atmosphere could have been more than a billion years, depending on 

the escape rates.  However, the  current knowledge on the origin and evolution of 

Triton’s atmosphere is poorly known and a new mission to Neptune or particularly 

to Triton, such as the recently proposed NASA flyby-mission Trident (Mitchell et 

al., 2019; Prockter et al., 2019), which carries a plasma spectrometer that will probe 

Triton’s tenuous atmosphere by passing through its upper layers at about 500 km 

(Mitchell et al., 2019), would lead to new insights not only into the origin and evo-

lution of Triton’s atmosphere but also into Pluto’s.  

6 Conclusion 

  Within the last 15 years our knowledge of the nitrogen atmospheres of the icy 

bodies in the solar system significantly advanced particularly due to Cassini around 

Saturn and the flyby of New Horizons at Pluto. However, other space missions such 

27 

as Rosetta and ground-based observations of the icy bodies and particularly of com-

ets also  helped to trace the origin of their atmospheric N2. The different isotopic 

signatures of nitrogen in cometary ammonia ices, refractory organics, chondrites, 

and  in  the  proto-solar  nebula  define  different  reservoirs  of  which  the  icy  bodies 

could have accreted their nitrogen. In contrast to Earth – its nitrogen atmosphere 

most probably originated from the chondritic reservoir – it currently seems likely 

that their building blocks might have originated from NH3 in comets and potentially 

from refractory organics in case of Titan, and from comets and/or the protosolar 

nebula in case of Pluto and potentially Triton. For understanding their origin, how-

ever, it is crucial to study the various fractionation processes that take place in the 

atmospheres of these bodies as several studies successfully did in the recent past. 

Here, it is important to note that the evolution of Titan, Triton and Pluto is strongly 

dependent on the evolution of the Sun which has profound effects on their atmos-

pheres, promoting escape and chemical reactions, and therefore on isotopic frac-

tionation. Only if we understand the solar evolution, will it be possible to trace back 

the origin of the nitrogen atmospheres of the icy bodies, and the history of the Sun 

can best be reconstructed via comparative planetology.

 Even though comparative planetology is  helpful to understand the origin and 

evolution of nitrogen atmospheres in general, future in-situ missions to the icy bod-

ies will be required to answer currently unknown questions and to better understand 

their origin (see Table 3 for future key measurements for a better understanding of 

the nitrogen atmospheres of the icy satellites in the solar system, and, particularly, 

Glein  (2015)  for  a  thorough analysis  on future  measurements  for  a better under-

standing  of  Titan).  In  2019  NASA  announced  that  the  space  mission  Dragonfly 

(Lorenz et al., 2018; Turtle et al., 2018) which is going to be funded for flying to 

Titan. The mission will start in 2026 and arrive in 2034. Its main goal is to study 

Titan’s origin and habitability. It will explore the building blocks of the moon in 

unprecedented detail and will also tell us a lot about the origin of the other icy bodies 

in the solar system such as Triton and Pluto. Our knowledge about Triton, however, 

is mainly based on the flyby of Voyager 2 and on comparative planetology. Here, a 

mission to Neptune and its moon such as the recently proposed NASA Trident mis-

sion (Prockter et al., 2019) – or even a twin ice giants mission (see e.g. Hofstadter 

et  al.  (2017),  ESA’s  CDF  Study  Report on  Ice  Giants  (2019)  and  Fletcher  et  al. 

(2019) for the scientific potential of such missions) - would be crucial to signifi-

cantly  enhance  our  scientific  knowledge  about  this  satellite,  its  tenuous  nitrogen 

atmosphere and about icy bodies in general. Finally, another mission that was re-

cently selected by ESA, will help to better understand the potential building blocks 

 
29 

of Titan, Pluto, and Triton. Comet Interceptor (Snodgrass and Jones, 2019), which 

will launch in 2028, will be the first spacecraft to visit a pristine comet.
