ABSTRACT

The chemical composition of the solar corona is diﬀerent from that of the solar photosphere, with the
strongest variation being observed in active regions (ARs). Using data from the Extreme Ultraviolet
(EUV) Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode, we present a survey of coronal elemental composition
as expressed in the ﬁrst ionisation potential (FIP) bias in 28 ARs of diﬀerent ages and magnetic ﬂux
content, which are at diﬀerent stages in their evolution. We ﬁnd no correlation between the FIP bias
of an AR and its total unsigned magnetic ﬂux or age. However, there is a weak dependence of FIP
bias on the evolutionary stage, decreasing from 1.9-2.2 in ARs with spots to 1.5-1.6 in ARs that are at
more advanced stages of the decay phase. FIP bias shows an increasing trend with average magnetic
ﬂux density up to 200 G but this trend does not continue at higher values. The FIP bias distribution
within ARs has a spread between 0.4 and 1. The largest spread is observed in very dispersed ARs. We
attribute this to a range of physical processes taking place in these ARs including processes associated
with ﬁlament channel formation. These ﬁndings indicate that, while some general trends can be
observed, the processes inﬂuencing the composition of an AR are complex and speciﬁc to its evolution,
magnetic conﬁguration or environment. The spread of FIP bias values in ARs shows a broad match
with that previously observed in situ in the slow solar wind.

1. INTRODUCTION

The composition of the Sun’s plasma is a key indicator
of important physical processes at play in the solar at-
mosphere, such as heating or mass and energy transport.
While the photospheric plasma composition is relatively
well determined and constant across the Sun’s surface
and in time (Asplund et al. 2009), the coronal plasma
composition is variable and can be diﬀerent from the
photospheric values (Meyer 1985a). The presence of this
variability is also supported by in-situ measurements of
the chemical composition of the solar wind, which also

show a variable composition (von Steiger and Schwadron
2000).

The abundance variation of an element is strongly de-
pendent on its ﬁrst ionisation potential (FIP; Meyer
1985a,b) and not on other parameters such as mass or
charge (Meyer 1991). Elements with a low FIP such as
Si, Fe, Mg and Ca are enhanced in the corona, com-
pared to high-FIP elements such as S, Ar, Ne and O,
which maintain their photospheric abundances. This is
called the FIP eﬀect. To characterise the degree of en-
hancement of low-FIP elements in the corona and how
it changes with time, we use the FIP bias parameter:

So far, the theoretical model that best explains the
FIP eﬀect is the ponderomotive force model - initially
proposed by Laming (2004) with further developments
being detailed in the review by Laming (2015). Pondero-
motive forces arise from the eﬀects of wave refraction in
an inhomogenous plasma. The model proposes that, in
the solar atmosphere, Alfv´en waves can be generated in
the corona, travel to lower altitudes and refract in the
high density gradient of the chromosphere. This change
in wave direction can exert a ponderomotive force on the
ions in the plasma, acting as an agent to separate them
from the neutrals. Ions then travel in the direction of
high wave energy density, so a higher wave energy den-
sity in the corona leads to a stronger FIP eﬀect. This
eﬀect is ampliﬁed in closed loops where nanoﬂares can
give rise to coronal Alfv´en waves. These Alfv´en waves
gradually refract at the loop chromospheric footpoints,
until they undergo total internal reﬂection and travel
back into the corona. The model proposes that coronal
Alfv´en waves are naturally at resonance with the loop so
they travel repeatedly between footpoints, continuously
driving the fractionation. Typical timescales of this pro-
cess are on the order of hours to a couple of days.

The strongest FIP eﬀect is observed in active re-
gions (ARs). The plasma composition in an AR varies
throughout its evolution and is modulated by diﬀerent
processes during the emergence and decay phases (Wid-
ing and Feldman 2001; Baker et al. 2015; Ko et al. 2016;
Baker et al. 2018). A study of 4 emerging ARs at so-
lar minimum found the emerging ﬂux initially exhib-
ited plasma with photospheric abundances (Widing and
Feldman 2001). The observations, based on Skylab spec-
troheliograms, used the Mg/Ne ratio (log T ≈ 5.6 − 5.7,
i.e. T ≈ 300, 000 − 500, 000 K) as a measure of the
FIP bias. The results suggest that emerging AR loops
bring up material from the photosphere into the corona.
As ﬂux emergence continued, the FIP bias gradually in-
creased almost linearly with AR age for 3-4 days in the
analysed large ARs.

A more recent study, however, showed that this FIP
bias increase does not continue in the later stages as
suggested by initial Skylab observations (Widing and
Feldman 2001), but rather it starts to decrease once
the AR goes through its middle and late decay phases
(Baker et al. 2015). The observations, from the Hin-
ode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al.
2007), used the Si X 258.38 ˚A/S X 264.23 ˚A (log T ≈ 6.2,
i.e. T ≈ 1.5 MK) line ratio as a FIP bias measure
(see Brooks and Warren 2011; Brooks et al. 2015, for
a complete description of the method). In the studied
AR, the decay phase was dominated by a global de-
crease in FIP bias. Small bipoles emerged within and

around the boundary of supergranular cells, as the mag-
netic ﬁeld got progressively more dispersed. The small
newly emerged loops contain photospheric plasma and
their reconnection with older AR loops brings this pho-
tospheric material upwards into the corona, leading to
plasma mixing. The mixing timescales are shorter than
the fractionation timescales so the overall FIP bias de-
creases. Another study (using a similar FIP bias diag-
nostic) followed the decay phase of another large AR and
found that FIP bias values decrease in the decay phase
and eventually settle around the FIP bias value of 1.5,
corresponding to the FIP bias value of the surrounding
quiet Sun (Ko et al. 2016).

A subsequent study, following the temporal evolution
of coronal plasma composition within seven emerging
ﬂux regions inside a coronal hole (CH), found that FIP
bias increases in the emergence and early decay phases,
before decreasing in the middle and late decay phase
(Baker et al. 2018). Baker et al. (2018) proposed that
the FIP bias increase in the emergence phase is driven
by the fractionation process (Laming 2004, 2015) and
transport of fractionated plasma into the corona, while
the FIP bias decrease in the late decay phase is linked to
the composition of the surrounding corona and the rate
of reconnection with this surrounding magnetic ﬁeld.

As well as temporal variation, ARs show spatial vari-
ation in FIP bias. The highest FIP bias values are ob-
served at AR loop footpoints (Baker et al. 2013), indi-
cating that this is where the fractionation process takes
place (as proposed by Laming 2004). Traces of high FIP
bias are observed along some of the AR loops, indicating
plasma starting to mix along loops (Baker et al. 2013).
Flux cancellation along the AR main polarity inversion
line (PIL), and the associated ﬂux rope formation leads
to lower FIP bias levels (Baker et al. 2013, 2022). Lower
FIP bias levels were also found in the part of an AR
where two failed eruptions occured (Baker et al. 2015).
The coronal plasma above the cool umbra of a very large
sunspot was found to have photospheric composition,
while the coronal loops rooted in the penumbra showed
fractionated plasma, with the highest FIP bias values
(3-4) being observed in the loops that connect within
the AR (Baker et al. 2021).

These previous studies found trends in how FIP bias
evolves and is distributed within ARs, and it would be
interesting to analyse whether the observed trends hold
for all ARs. Key questions include: are the composition
trends similar for ARs of diﬀerent sizes? Do larger ARs
reach higher FIP bias values? How does the FIP bias of
an AR evolve in the very late stages of the decay phase?
In this survey, we analyse plasma composition data
from 28 ARs from 3 full Sun EIS scans to explore how

FIP bias relates to their evolutionary stage and mag-
netic conﬁguration. The ﬁrst full Sun FIP bias map was
initially used to investigate potential slow solar wind
sources (Brooks et al. 2015), as well as compare in situ
solar wind composition data to its source region com-
position measured by EIS (Stansby et al. 2020). The
28-AR dataset contains ARs of all evolutionary stages,
from emergence to decay, including very dispersed ARs
that are in a more developed stage than the ones anal-
ysed in previous studies. We look at individual case
studies to investigate how particular aspects of an AR
(e.g. ﬁlament/ﬁlament channel formation, ﬂux cancel-
lation) can inﬂuence coronal plasma composition.

2. OBSERVATIONS

The dataset used for this study comprises three full
Sun EIS scans taken on 16-18 January 2013, 1-3 April
2015 and 18-20 October 2015. In total, these scans cover
28 ARs and provide composition measurements at the
time of the scan. The ARs are shown in Figure 1 and
their general characteristics are given in Table 1.

2.1. Coronal EUV and Magnetic ﬁeld observations

The history of each AR was explored using line of sight
magnetogram images from the Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al.
2012), to determine its approximate age and complex-
ity at the time of each EIS scan. EUV images from
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) instrument, particularly in the 171 ˚A (log T ≈ 5.8;
quiet corona and upper transition region) and 193 ˚A
(log T ≈ 6.2, 7.3; corona and hot ﬂare plasma) pass-
bands, and HMI continuum images were used to provide
full context of the evolution and history of each AR.

At the time of the January 2013 scan, the Solar Terres-
trial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A; Kaiser et al.
2008) spacecraft and SDO were located such that they
provided full coverage of the Sun: SDO was located at
Earth and STEREO-A (STEREO-B) was located ap-
proximately 120◦ ahead of (behind) the Earth with re-
spect to the Sun-Earth line. In the absence of magne-
tograms, EUV images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Im-
agers (EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004) in the Sun Earth Con-
nection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SEC-
CHI; Howard et al. 2008) instrument suite, particularly
in the 195 ˚A passband (log T ≈ 6.1, 7.2), were used to
track ARs when they were on the far side of the Sun.
This allowed for a better determination of when the ARs
emerged, and, therefore, a more precise age calculation
for the ARs in this scan. However, the STEREO space-
craft were not available for the two scans that took place

in 2015. Communications with STEREO-B were lost in
2014 and, in 2015, STEREO-A was located at an angle
of approximately 180◦ from the Earth which resulted
in a data gap coinciding with the time running up to
the EIS scans. Where the exact moment of AR emer-
gence could not be captured (either because of space-
craft availability limiting the coverage or due to a data
gap), a minimum and maximum age were determined
instead. The minimum (maximum) age was given by
the ﬁrst available observation of the AR (last available
observation before the data gap).

Synoptic map data from the Global Oscillations Net-
work Group (GONG; Harvey et al. 1996) instruments
were used to identify whether an AR is part of an ac-
tivity nest. These are long-lived regions of magnetic ac-
tivity, where repeated ﬂux emergence takes place. Mag-
netic ﬁelds brought up by each ﬂux emergence reconnect
with the preexisting ﬁeld, making activity nests sites
of stronger magnetic reconnection and heating rates.
Where an AR emerged in a region of preexisting mag-
netic environment, the AR was tracked back in time
for multiple rotations to identify whether repeated ﬂux
emergence took place at its location.
If that was the
case, both the age of the most recent signiﬁcant ﬂux
emergence and the age of the nest were determined.

2.2. FIP bias and plasma composition

FIP bias was calculated using the Hinode EIS Si X
258.38 ˚A (low FIP, FIP = 8.15 eV) and S X 264.23 ˚A
(high FIP, FIP = 10.36 eV) ratio. The method for calcu-
lating the FIP bias in each pixel was described in detail
by Brooks and Warren (2011); Brooks et al. (2015) and
is designed to remove temperature and density eﬀects
on the FIP bias calculation. Here, the Fe XIII 202.04
˚A/203.82 ˚A ratio was used to estimate the electron den-
sity, and Fe lines Fe VIII to XVI to derive the diﬀerential
emission measure (DEM). The Si X/S X diagnostic is
appropriate for plasma temperatures of log T ≈ 6.2, i.e.
T ≈ 1.5 MK (Feldman et al. 2009), making it ideal for
studying quiescent ARs like the ones presented in this
study. The EIS study details and emission lines used
are summarized in Table 2.2.

3. METHOD AND DATA ANALYSIS

3.1. Full Sun maps

Each full Sun map was created by stitching together
26 EIS observations (rasters) taken from 09:37 UT on
the 16th to 07:06 UT on the 18th for the January 2013
scan, from 09:14 UT on the 1st to 01:49 UT on the 3rd
for the April 2015 scan and from 10:27 UT on the 16th to
01:31 UT on the 18th for the October 2015 scan. Before
creating the full Sun maps, pixels that had an associated

for the DEM calculation, see Brooks and Warren 2011;
Brooks et al. 2015, for a full description of the method)
were removed from each raster.

The individual EIS rasters are taken such that, to-
gether, they cover the entire Sun, which means that
there are overlap regions with data from two or more
rasters. The full Sun map value for these pixels is cal-
culated after the FIP bias ﬁltering, as the average of all
the pixel values available for that location. The January
2013 full Sun FIP bias map (Figure 1c) shows the same
data that was used by Brooks et al. (2015), but note
that the display image in their Figure 3 is not directly
comparable. Figure 3 in Brooks et al. (2015) shows qual-
itative data (the FIP bias deﬁned as the Si X 258.38 ˚A/S
X 264.23 ˚A intensity ratio), while Figure 1c here shows
the quantitative data (the FIP bias computed from the
DEM calculation) - see the discussion in Brooks et al.
(2015) on how their Figure 3 was constructed.

To create the corresponding full Sun magnetogram,
cropped HMI images that match the start time and ﬁeld
of view (FOV) of each of the individual rasters are also
stitched together. This is to ensure that we compare

FIP bias to the magnetogram that is closest in time for

recent magnetogram data were kept.

3.2. Active region deﬁnition

ARs were identiﬁed using HMI line of sight (LOS)
magnetic ﬁeld data, and their boundaries were deﬁned
by eye in the plane of the image, tracking the evolu-
tion of the AR and looking for a sharp gradient be-
tween the magnetic ﬂux of the AR and its surround-
ings. The selected contours were broad enough to in-
clude all the magnetic ﬂux associated with the AR. This
included small-scale background ﬁeld between AR ﬁeld
fragments, but this was accounted for by ﬁltering out
pixels with an absolute magnetic ﬂux density of less
than 30 G. The same method was used for selecting the
boundaries of individual polarities within an AR. In ad-
dition, when selecting the contour for one polarity, any
opposite polarity ﬁeld was ﬁltered out as well.

The HMI contours were then plotted over the FIP
bias map to extract the composition data. Each AR is
characterised by the median FIP bias value of the distri-
bution of values within the contour (the 50th percentile)
and the spread (the diﬀerence between the 25th and 75th
percentiles). Note that the spread is an indicator of the
range of FIP bias values observed in the AR, rather than
an error associated with the median FIP bias value. We
also characterise the skewness using Kelly’s skewness co-
eﬃcient, Sk = (P90 + P10 − 2 × P50)/(P90 − P10).

4. RESULTS

It has long been recognised that the strongest FIP ef-
fect is observed in ARs. ARs are sites of stronger mag-
netic activity, so it is likely that the magnetic ﬁeld is
driving the FIP eﬀect. We aim to get a better under-
standing of how the magnetic ﬁeld and its distribution
within an AR inﬂuences the observed FIP bias.

4.1. FIP bias vs active region total unsigned magnetic

ﬂux and age

An AR’s total unsigned magnetic ﬂux varies through-
out its lifetime, as a function of age and the lifetime of an
AR depends on its magnetic ﬂux content (Schrijver and
Zwaan 2000). Therefore, total unsigned magnetic ﬂux
and age must be considered together. The variation of
FIP bias with AR total unsigned magnetic ﬂux and age
is shown in Figures 2 and 3. In both plots, the vertical
bars indicate the FIP bias spread, i.e. the 25th and 75th
percentile of the distribution in each region, rather than
a measurement error. For the ARs that emerged on a
part of the Sun that was not observed by any spacecraft,
the age measurement has an associated error bar that

corresponds to the minimum and maximum age for that
region (see Section 2.1). The plots in Figures 2 and 3
show no global correlation between the FIP bias of an
AR and total unsigned magnetic ﬂux or age. However,
this does not mean that there is no change in the FIP
bias of ARs during their lifetimes. Rather, it indicates
the need to study FIP bias variation in the context of
the evolution of each AR and understand their individ-
ual evolutionary paths. It is likely that a normalisation
of these parameters would be needed for a better com-
parison between ARs, i.e. normalise the total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux by peak total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (the
magnetic ﬂux content of the AR), and normalise the age
by the total lifetime of the AR. This would essentially
be an indicator for the evolutionary stage of each AR,
but the reduced HMI coverage throughout their lifetime
would make such a calculation very diﬃcult.

4.2. FIP bias vs magnetic ﬂux density

As ARs evolve from emergence through decay, there
is a change in their magnetic ﬂux density. The next

The vertical bars indicate the FIP bias spread, i.e. the 25th

values and the magnetic ﬂux density in the region ≤ 200 G

question we ask is whether the ﬂux density inﬂuences
the FIP bias. The variation of FIP bias as a function
of magnetic ﬂux density is shown in Figure 4. Similar
to Figures 2 and 3, the vertical bars show the spread in
FIP bias within the region. Data points in red (blue)
correspond to leading (following) polarities. The yellow
dots indicate polarities that still have a sunspot. For
this plot, data from individual polarities were used in-
stead of overall ARs. This decision was motivated by
the asymmetries in the motion and stability of the lead-
ing and following polarities, which result in the follow-
ing polarity decaying faster than the leading polarity
(Hale and Nicholson 1938). Analysing them separately
ensures that the magnetic ﬂux density is more homo-
geneous within the selected region.
In the emergence
phase, the leading polarity converges immediately into
a more compact and longer lived magnetic ﬁeld conﬁg-
uration, while the following polarity may form shorter
lived spots that become dispersed faster. This results
in diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld densities in opposite polari-
ties, essentially placing them at diﬀerent evolutionary
stages. However, the asymmetry becomes weaker with
time, so the separation into leading and following polar-
ities is particularly important for younger ARs and less
important for dispersed ARs.

The results show that FIP bias increases with mag-
netic ﬂux density in the region ≤ 200 G. The Pearson
correlation coeﬃcient between the median FIP bias val-
ues and the magnetic ﬂux density in this region is 0.65.
This is in agreement with Baker et al. (2013) who found
a moderate correlation between FIP bias and magnetic
ﬂux density. It is interesting to note that, although pop-

8

Mihailescu et al.

metry is also reﬂected in the diﬀerent FIP bias values,
likely due to the fact that the higher ﬂux density above
the sunspot is actually decreasing the overall FIP bias
(see Section 4.2). This AR is located close to disc centre,
such that diﬀerences in FIP bias are likely due to asym-
metries in the opposite polarities rather than projection
eﬀects.

4.4. Regions at diﬀerent evolutionary stages

The ARs in the dataset are at diﬀerent stages in their
evolution and can, therefore, oﬀer insight into FIP bias
values in these diﬀerent stages. For this, we categorise
the ARs into 5 groups based on their evolutionary stages
(see Table 3). The lifetime of an AR is typically divided
into emergence phase and decay phase. The decay phase
is always longer than the emergence phase, but it varies
from around 70% of the total lifetime for ephemeral ARs
to as much as 97% for large ARs (van Driel-Gesztelyi
and Green 2015). As the decay phase is so much longer,
here we divide it even further into substages: ARs that
still have sunspots (at the peak development or in their
early decay phase), decayed ARs (sunspots have disap-
peared), extended and very dispersed ARs (ﬁeld is so
dispersed that it is not easily distinguished from the
quiet Sun), and ARs with ﬁlament channels.

The results shown in Table 3 suggest that, generally,
the FIP bias of fully developed ARs is higher than that
of the emerging AR and then it reduces for the progres-
sively more dispersed groups. Baker et al. (2018) found
a dependence of FIP bias on AR evolution for seven
emerging ﬂux regions. The present result indicates that
the same behaviour is found in small and large ARs as
well.

The lowest FIP bias values are found in ARs that
formed ﬁlament channels. A case study example of AR
R11 is shown in Figure 7. The ﬁlament channel is seen as
the dark feature in the EUV emission (Figure 7a). This
corresponds to a corridor of low magnetic ﬁeld strength
along the PIL in the associated magnetogram (Figure
7b), which is a sign of ongoing ﬂux cancellation tak-
ing place along the PIL to form the ﬁlament channel
structure. The FIP bias map (Figure 7c) indicates that
the ﬁlament channel has distinctly lower FIP bias values
than the rest of the AR. It is likely that this is due to ﬂux
cancellation taking place in the lower atmosphere (Baker
et al. 2022). Post reconnection loops bring photospheric
material up into the corona, and plasma mixing leads to
an overall lower FIP bias value.

4.5. FIP bias distribution

FIP bias within the ARs has a signiﬁcant spread (dif-
ference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the FIP

following (blue)
polarities. The x axis indicates the active region R code (1-
28) used within the dataset, as deﬁned in Figure 1. The
vertical bars indicate the FIP bias spread, i.e. the 25th and
75th percentile of the distribution in each region. The 50th
percentile is highlighted with a star. Active regions that still
have a sunspot are highlighted with a yellow dot.

ulated with fewer data points, the same trend does not
seem to continue in the region ≥ 200 G. Above this
threshold, all the data points still have sunspots.

4.3. FIP bias in leading vs. following polarities

A comparison between the median FIP bias values in
the leading vs. following polarities of the ARs is shown
in Figure 5. The plot shows that 10 ARs (35% of the
sample) have higher FIP bias in the following polarity, 8
ARs (28%) have higher FIP bias in the leading polarity
and the remaining 10 ARs (35%) have approximately the
same FIP bias in both polarities (diﬀerence smaller than
0.05 in FIP bias). The higher FIP bias values registered
in one polarity or another are not correlated with the
AR’s position on the disc, indicating that this diﬀerence
is due to an asymmetry between the two polarities rather
than a projection eﬀect.

Across the dataset, there is a large variety of ARs at
diﬀerent evolutionary stages: an emerging AR (R10),
very decayed ARs that have formed ﬁlament channels
along their main PILs (e.g., R8, R11, R21), ARs that
have compact magnetic ﬁeld in both polarities (e.g., R3,
R10, R24) or a single polarity (e.g., R1), ARs that have
decayed far beyond having homogeneous ﬁeld in either
the leading or the following polarities (e.g., R7, R14,
R19), ARs that are dominated by one polarity (e.g.,
R8). It is likely that this very varied coronal ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration is the reason why no systematic trend is seen.
A case study of R1 (January 2013) is shown in Fig-
ure 6. The leading polarity has lower FIP bias than the
following polarity. This AR is an example showing the
asymmetric evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in the lead-
ing polarity as compared to the following. The leading
polarity is more compact and still has a sunspot, while
the following polarity is already dispersed. The asym-

bias distribution), which varies between 0.4 and 1.0. The
spread values for all the ARs are given in Table 1, and
individual AR contours and characteristics are shown in
Appendix A. Reference examples for the distribution of
FIP bias values in a quiet Sun and coronal hole regions
are shown in Figure 14 of the Appendix.

This spread is likely an indicator of diﬀerent substruc-
tures within an AR having diﬀerent FIP bias values. A
case study example of R11 is shown in Figure 7. This
is a very decayed AR, with lower FIP bias values in
the ﬁlament channel along its main PIL and higher FIP
bias values in the arcade loops and hotter areas, which is
likely why this AR has a relatively high FIP bias spread.
The lowest spread is seen in ARs that are located close
to the limb, which is likely due to the method used for
deﬁning the AR contours. The HMI magnetic ﬁeld is a
photospheric measurement, while the FIP bias is a coro-
nal observation. Magnetic ﬁeld expands into the corona
compared to the photosphere, so using a photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld contour will likely introduce a challenge
in fully capturing the coronal loops. Closer to the limb,
this eﬀect is ampliﬁed by projection eﬀects.

Additionally, all distributions were found to be right
hand skewed (see Table 1). The skewness coeﬃcient has
a wide range of values for all the evolutionary stages

between ARs with spots and very dispersed ARs (see
Table 3). However, in the ARs with ﬁlament channels
category, the skewness coeﬃcient values do not exhibit
this variation.

5. DISCUSSION

By taking the median FIP bias value (50th percentile
value) to be representative of each AR (see Table 1 and
Figures 8-13 in the Appendix), we ﬁnd that the median
FIP bias values fall in the range 1.4 to 2.2, very similar
to the values found by Baker et al. (2018) which var-
ied between 1.2 and 2.0. Baker et al. (2018) analysed
emerging ﬂux regions with a total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux of 0.13 − 38 × 1020 Mx, while the ARs in the present
study range from small to large, and have total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux values of 1 − 36.4 × 1021 Mx. Very similar
FIP bias values are observed, in spite of the signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in total magnetic ﬂux, which is a further indi-
cation that FIP bias is not inﬂuenced by the total mag-
netic ﬂux. For reference, the median FIP bias values for
a representative example of quiet Sun was 1.5 and for
coronal hole 1.0 (see Figures 8-13 in the Appendix)

Magnetic ﬂux density, however, appears to play a role.
FIP bias increases with magnetic ﬂux density in the re-
gion ≤ 200 G, but that trend appears to stop for the

data points ≥ 200 G, which all belong to regions with
sunspots.
In the region ≤ 200 G, increased magnetic
ﬂux density drives stronger heating at the chromospheric
loop footpoints, ionising higher proportion of elements
and, therefore, driving a stronger fractionation process
which increases the FIP bias. In contrast, in the region
≥ 200 G the strong magnetic ﬁeld concentration in the
umbra of sunspots can inhibit convection and lower the
temperature at chromospheric level which means a lower
proportion of elements are being ionized, thus produc-
ing a lower FIP eﬀect. This scenario is supported by the
study of Baker et al. (2021) who found that the FIP bias
in the umbra of a very strong sunspot has photospheric
values.

Also, it is interesting to note that an AR moves from
higher to lower magnetic ﬂux density throughout its
evolution (so from right to left on the plot in Figure
4). Most of the ARs in the dataset are in diﬀerent
stages of the decay phase. The ones with a ﬂux den-
sity ≥ 200 G still have sunspots, and they are in the
early decay phase, while the ones ≤ 100 G are in the
late decay phase. The trend of FIP bias decreasing with
decreasing magnetic ﬂux density, is, therefore, an indi-
rect indication that FIP bias decreases with time in the
AR decay phase. This result is in agreement with the
previous result of Baker et al. (2015) who found that,
in the decay phase of an AR, FIP bias is decreasing and
remains coronal for a longer time only in a part of the
AR’s high ﬂux density core.

In the ﬂux density region of ≤ 200 G, FIP bias is
decreasing from 2.2 to 1.4, where the 1.4 is observed in
two ARs that are very dispersed to the point where they
are hard to distinguish from quiet Sun. This is in line
with the results of Ko et al. (2016), who found that, in
a decaying AR, FIP bias decreases from 1.8 over 3 days
until it settles at a value of 1.5, which they describe as
a ‘basal’ state of the quiet Sun. The FIP bias method
and line ratio used in their study is very similar to the
one used in this study, which means the values can be
compared directly.

The FIP bias distribution within the ARs has a sig-
niﬁcant spread, which indicates that there is a range
of physical processes in diﬀerent AR substructures that
inﬂuence the FIP bias in diﬀerent ways. An interest-
ing example is presented by the four regions that have
formed ﬁlament channels along their main PIL. While
having the lowest overall FIP bias values, they show a
high spread and percentage of high FIP bias values. The
spatial distribution of the FIP bias indicates a closer to
photospheric value in the ﬁlament channel with higher
FIP bias values surrounding the channel in the remnant
AR arcade ﬁeld. Having these substructures with diﬀer-
ent plasma composition increases the spread of the FIP
bias distribution.

The lack of general trends of FIP bias with total mag-
netic ﬂux and age or systematic reasons for the observed
diﬀerences in the FIP bias in leading and following po-
larities, as well as the dependence of FIP bias on the AR
evolutionary stage, indicate that the processes inﬂuenc-

ARs that are very dispersed and formed ﬁlament chan-
nels along their PILs. The FIP bias dependence on the
evolutionary stage of the AR is also supported by the
trend of FIP bias decreasing with magnetic ﬂux density
in the region ≤ 200 G. This is an indirect indication that
FIP bias decreases with time in the AR decay phase, in
agreement with previous ﬁndings (Baker et al. 2015).

The median FIP bias values found in these ARs are
generally lower than the FIP bias values observed in situ
in the slow solar wind (von Steiger and Schwadron 2000;
Stansby et al. 2020). This could suggest that the slow
solar wind originates from the part of an AR that has
stronger FIP bias, emphasising the importance of under-
standing physical processes at play in these locations.

ing the composition of an AR are complex and speciﬁc
to its evolution, history and magnetic conﬁguration or
environment.

It is interesting to compare the AR FIP bias values
to in situ studies of slow solar wind composition. Al-
though the slow solar wind is believed to originate from
ARs, the in situ composition measurements ﬁnd higher
FIP bias values than the ones observed in the presented
ARs. von Steiger and Schwadron (2000) found that the
average FIP bias of the slow solar wind, relative to O
and averaged over three low-FIP elements (Mg, Si, Fe)
is 2.6. This is quite high, compared to the median FIP
bias values presented in this study (1.4 to 2.2). Brooks
et al. (2015) analysed the January 2013 full Sun scan
and identiﬁed potential slow solar wind sources at the
edges of a number of ARs that were present on the sur-
face of the Sun at the time. Notably, AR11654 (here R3)
showed strong upﬂows on its eastern edge and was fur-
ther investigated by Stansby et al. (2020). The FIP bias
values observed both in the upﬂow region (remotely, us-
ing EIS data) and in the solar wind (in situ, using ACE
data) are generally higher than the median FIP bias for
that region. It is possible that the higher FIP bias val-
ues in the upﬂow regions contribute to the skewed part
of the distributions presented here. Brooks and War-
ren (2011) also found that AR upﬂows can be a source
of slow solar wind, with the EIS FIP bias values in the
region of interest being within 20% of the ACE in situ
measurements.

6. CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we investigate the characteristics of coro-
nal plasma elemental composition across 28 ARs of vary-
ing size, magnetic complexity and age. The sample
of ARs includes one in its emergence phase, with the
longest lived in the study being 244 days old. Plasma
composition is determined through the FIP bias value,
which indicates by how much low-FIP elements are en-
hanced in the corona relative to high-FIP elements, and
the range of ARs studied enables an analysis of how
plasma composition might be inﬂuenced by magnetic
ﬁeld strength, age, complexity and evolutionary stage.
OUr ﬁndings show that there appears to be no corre-
lation between FIP bias and total ﬂux content of an AR
or its age, which highlights our overall conclusion that
plasma composition is aﬀected by characteristics of the
region that relate to its speciﬁc evolutionary journey.
Our study ﬁnds that young ARs have closer to photo-
spheric composition, and the FIP bias then increases
in the ARs that are more developed and formed spots.
The FIP bias then decreases in the progressively more
decayed ARs, with the lowest values being observed in
