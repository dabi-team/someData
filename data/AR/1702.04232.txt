ABSTRACT

A three-dimensional semiclassical model is used to study double ionization of Ar when driven by a near-infrared and near-
single-cycle laser pulse for intensities ranging from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to 5×1014 W/cm2. Asymmetry parameters, distributions
of the sum of the two electron momentum components along the direction of the polarization of the laser ﬁeld and correlated
momenta are computed as a function of intensity and of the carrier envelope phase. A very good agreement is found with
recently obtained results in kinematically complete experiments employing near-single-cycle laser pulses. Moreover, the
contribution of the direct and delayed pathways of double ionization is investigated for the above observables. Finally, an
experimentally obtained anti-correlation momentum pattern at higher intensities is reproduced with the three-dimensional
semiclassical model and shown to be due to a transition from strong to soft recollisions with increasing intensity.

Introduction

Non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) in intense near-infrared laser ﬁelds is a fundamental process with electron-electron
correlation playing a key role1–3. Considerable information regarding NSDI has been obtained from kinematically complete
experiments, i.e., the momenta of the escaping electrons and ions are measured in coincidence4. Most of these experiments
employ multi-cycle laser pulses allowing for multiple recollisions to occur before both electrons ionize. Multiple recollisions
complicate the electron dynamics and render the comparison with theory difﬁcult. Recently, however, kinematically complete
experiments succeeded in conﬁning NSDI to a single laser cycle by using carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-controlled few- and
near-single-cycle pulses5, 6. These experiments with near-single-cycle pulses allow for an easier comparison between theory
and experiment.

To interpret the double ionization spectra of driven Ar measured using near-single-cycle laser pulses, a simple one-
dimensional (1D) classical model was put forth6–8. This model relies on the assumption that the dominant pathways of double
ionization are, for small and intermediate intensities, delayed non-sequential ionization and, for higher intensities, sequential
ionization. This model neglects the contribution of another major pathway of double ionization, namely, direct ionization as
well as the Coulomb potential. This 1D model did not achieve a quantitative agreement with the complete set of available
experimental data over the whole intensity range. Delayed ionization—also referred to as recollision-induced excitation with
subsequent ﬁeld ionization, RESI9, 10, and direct ionization are two main pathways of NSDI. An interesting ﬁnding of these
near-single cycle experiments was that the correlated momenta components of the two escaping electrons along the direction of
the laser ﬁeld have a cross-shaped pattern for an intensity around 1014 W/cm26–8. A cross-shaped correlated momenta pattern
due to the delayed double ionization mechanism was previously identiﬁed in the context of strongly-driven He at an intensity
9×1014 W/cm2 and a wavelength 400 nm11. In the context of strongly-driven Ar, the above described 1D model attributed
the cross-shaped pattern of the correlated momenta to the delayed pathway of double ionization7, 8. Furthermore, a quantum
mechanical calculation, which only considers the delayed pathway of double ionization and neglects the Coulomb potential,
identiﬁed the key role that the symmetry of the excited state plays in the ﬁnal shape of the correlated momenta12.

In this work, using a three-dimensional (3D) semiclassical model, NSDI of Ar is studied when Ar is driven by 750 nm
near-single-cycle laser pulses at intensities ranging from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to 5×1014 W/cm2. In this 3D model the only
approximation is in the initial state. There is no approximation during the time propagation. That is, all Coulomb forces and
the interaction of each electron with the laser ﬁeld are fully accounted for. No assumptions are made regarding the prevailing

 
 
 
 
 
 
mechanism of double ionization and there is no free parameter. This is not the case for the 1D model8. Moreover, the Coulomb
singularity is fully accounted for using regularized coordinates13. This is an advantage over models which soften the Coulomb
potential14. Previous successes of this 3D model include identifying the mechanism responsible for the ﬁngerlike structure15,
which was predicted theoretically16 and was observed experimentally for He driven by 800 nm laser ﬁelds17, 18. Moreover, this
model was used to investigate direct versus delayed pathways of NSDI for He driven by a 400 nm laser ﬁeld while achieving
excellent agreement with fully ab-initio quantum mechanical calculations19. Using this model, in this work, several observables
are computed for different intensities of strongly-driven Ar. These observables are the sum of the two electron momentum
components along the direction of the polarization of the laser ﬁeld and the double differential probability of the two electron
momentum components along the polarization direction of the laser ﬁeld. Furthermore, the amplitude and the phase of the
asymmetry parameter that determines the difference of the ions escaping with positive versus negative momentum along the
polarization direction of the laser ﬁeld are computed as a function of the carrier envelope phase (CEP) and the intensity. The
computed results using the 3D semiclassical model are found to be in better agreement with the experimental results over
the whole intensity range6–8 compared to the results obtained with the 1D model in ref.8. Motivated by the good agreement
between theory and experiment, the strength of the 3D semiclassical model in fully accounting for the electron dynamics is
utilized to identify the prevailing pathway of double ionization as a function of intensity. In addition, for a small intensity
around 1014 W/cm2, the dependence of the double ionization pathways on CEP is computed using the 3D semiclassical model.
Finally, the transition from strong to soft recollisions is identiﬁed as the main reason for the experimentally observed escape of
the two electrons with opposite velocities at higher intensities20.

1 Method

For the current studies, a 3D semiclassical model is employed that is formulated in the framework of the dipole approximation15.
The time propagation is determined by the three-body Hamiltonian of the two electrons with the nucleus kept ﬁxed. All
Coulomb forces are accounted for: the interaction of each electron with the nucleus and the laser ﬁeld and the electron-electron
interaction are all included in the time propagation. The laser ﬁeld is given by

(cid:16)
–2ln2( t
(cid:126)E(t) = E0e

τ )2(cid:17)

cos(ωt + φ)ˆz,

(1)

where τ = 4fs is the full-width-half-maximum pulse duration, ω=0.061 a.u (750 nm) the frequency, E0 the strength and φ the
CEP of the laser ﬁeld. In this work linearly polarized laser ﬁelds are considered. The initial state in the 3D model entails one
electron tunneling through the ﬁeld-lowered Coulomb potential with the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) formula21, 22. To
obtain the tunnel ionization rate for Ar, in the ADK formula the ﬁrst ionization energy of Ar, i.e. Ip1 = 0.579 a.u. and the
effective charge Z = 1 are used. The momentum along the direction of the electric ﬁeld is zero while the transverse one is
given by a Gaussian distribution21, 22. The remaining electron is initially described by a microcanonical distribution23. The
microcanonical distribution is obtained using the second ionization energy of Ar, i.e. Ip2 = 1.02 a.u. and an effective charge
equal to Z = 2 a.u. During the time propagation each electron is interacting with the nucleus with charge Z = 2. In what follows,
the tunneling and bound electron are denoted as electrons 1 and 2, respectively.

The intensities considered for the results presented range from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to 5×1014 W/cm2. For the smallest
intensity, 12 CEPs are considered ranging from φ = 15◦ to φ = 345◦ in steps of 30◦. For all other intensities, 24 CEPs are
considered ranging from φ = 0◦ to φ = 360◦ in steps of 15◦. For the results presented regarding total double ionization the
average has been taken over all CEPs for each intensity. It is noted that the computations required are challenging, since, it is
time-consuming to obtain enough double ionization events that render the statistical error very small for each of the 12 or 24
CEPs for each intensity. Therefore, computations were performed for six intensities in the range from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to
5×1014 W/cm2. Using the results obtained at these six intensities an average over the focal volume is performed24 to directly
compare with experiment. It is, however, noted that computations at a larger number of intensities are needed to account more
accurately for the focal volume effect. For the results presented it is stated explicitly when focal volume averaging is included
and when it is not.

2 Results

2.1 Double ionization and pathways
In Fig. 1, the ratio of double to single ionization events is computed as a function of the laser intensity and compared to the
experimental results8. It is found that the computed ratio of double to single ionization events reproduces well the overall
pattern of the observed ratio. The computed ratio is found to be at most a factor of two smaller than the observed ratio and by
a factor of 3.5 when the focal volume effect is accounted for. This difference possibly suggests that the effective charge of

Z = 2 used to model the attractive Coulomb potential in the 3D semiclassical model during time propagation overestimates the
Coulomb attraction.

and light blue crosses and computed results are presented by a solid line with black circles when the focal volume effect is not
accounted for and by a dashed-line with triangles when the focal volume effect is accounted for. The difference in the two
experimental sets results from slightly different averaging over the focal volume8.

Once the doubly ionizing events are obtained using the 3D model, an analysis of the trajectories is performed in time in
order to identify the contribution of the direct and the delayed pathway of NSDI as a function of the laser intensity. The main
two double ionization energy transfer pathways are identiﬁed by using the time difference between the recollision time trec
and the ionization time of each electron ti
ion, with i = 1, 2, for each doubly ionizing classical trajectory. The recollision time is
deﬁned as the time of minimum approach of the two electrons and is identiﬁed by the maximum in the electron pair potential
energy. The ionization time for each electron is deﬁned as the time when the sum of the electrons’ kinetic energies (using the
canonical momentum) and the potential energy due to the electron’s interaction with the nucleus becomes positive and remains
positive thereafter. The canonical momentum of an electron is given by p – A, with A the vector potential. The ionization time
of the tunneling electron is, thus, not necessarily the time this electron tunnels at the start of the time propagation. This energy
is referred to as compensated energy and was introduced in ref.25. A doubly ionized trajectory is labeled as delayed or direct
depending on the time differences t1

ion – trec. Speciﬁcally, if the conditions

ion – trec and t2

ion – trec| < tdiff, t2
|t1

are satisﬁed then the trajectory is labeled as direct. If the conditions

are satisﬁed then the trajectory is labeled as delayed. If the conditions

are satisﬁed then the trajectory is labeled as double delayed. The percentage of delayed and direct trajectories depends on
the choice of the time difference tdiff. This is shown in Fig. 2 where the probability of direct and delayed double ionization
events is plotted for tdiff equal to 1/10 T, 1/20 T and 1/40 T. The probability of the direct (delayed) ionization pathway is
obtained by dividing the number of doubly ionizing trajectories labeled as direct (delayed) with the total number of doubly
ionizing trajectories. It is found that the percentage contribution of the direct and the delayed double ionization pathways as
a function of intensity display general trends that do not signiﬁcantly depend on the choice of tdiff. Both the direct and the
delayed pathways of double ionization signiﬁcantly contribute at all intensities. Thus the direct pathway can not be neglected as
was done in previous models. The direct pathway contributes the most for intermediate intensities. In Fig. 2, at a high intensity
above 4×1014 W/cm2, it is shown that the percentage contribution of the direct pathway of double ionization starts decreasing.
At this high intensity a transition from strong to soft recollisions takes place, as discussed in the following. tdiff can not be
chosen neither very large, such as 1/4 T, or very small such as 1/40 T. Choices in between are reasonable and lead to similar
trends of the two prevailing pathways of double ionization. tdiff = 1/10 T is chosen for the results presented in this work. It is
found that double delayed trajectories contribute no more than 15% for the smallest intensity even when the time difference
is chosen small and equal to 1/40 T. If instead of the compensated energy the energy of each electron is used to identify the
ionization time different results are obtained. Namely, one ﬁnds that at an intensity of 0.85×1014 W/cm2 almost all trajectories

3/11

12345610-410-310-2are identiﬁed as double delayed. This was the conclusion in ref.5. Using the actual energy to identify the ionization time at an
intensity of 3×1014 W/cm2 results in the direct pathway of double ionization still only contributing 20%. However, this is not a
reasonable result. At 3×1014 W/cm2 3.17 Up is equal to 50 eV which is much higher than the second ionization energy of Ar.
Moreover, the recollsion at this intensity is strong, which is discussed in 2.4, and so the direct pathway of double ionization
should contribute signiﬁcantly. Thus, the compensated energy is employed to identify the ionization time in this work which
leads to both the direct and delayed pathway being the main pathways of double ionization in agreement with ref.14 for the
smallest intensity.

laser intensity for a delay time of 1/10 T (solid lines), 1/20 T (dashed lines) and 1/40T (dotted lines). The focal volume effect is
not accounted for.

2.2 Distribution of the sum of the momenta
In Fig. 3, the sum of the two electron momentum components along the polarization direction of the laser ﬁeld are presented
for intensities from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to 5×1014W/cm2. In Fig. 3, the contribution to the sum of the momenta of the direct
and the delayed pathways of double ionization is also shown; the focal volume effect is not accounted for. As expected, it is
found that the delayed pathway’s contribution is a distribution concentrated around zero while the direct pathway’s contribution
is a doubly-peaked distribution. The direct pathway’s distribution of the sum of the momenta is the broadest one. Therefore,
including only the delayed pathway of double ionization would result in a narrower distribution of the sum of the momenta than
the observed one. Indeed, the 1D model described in ref.8 which accounts only for the delayed pathway of double ionization
results in a narrower distribution of the sum of the momenta than the observed one. In Fig. 4, the experimental results for the
sum of the momenta in ref.8 are compared with one set of computed results that account for the focal volume effect (black
dashed lines) and one that does not (black solid lines). It is found that the computed results are in good agreement with the
observed ones. Speciﬁcally, it is found that, for each intensity, the computed sum of the momenta extends over a range that is
very similar to the experimental one. For instance, for an intensity of 0.85×1014 W/cm2, the computed sum of the momenta
extends over a range from roughly -2 a.u. to 2 a.u., while, for an intensity of 5×1014 W/cm2, it extends from -4 a.u. to 4 a.u.;
for both intensities these ranges are in agreement with the experimental results8. It is noted that a difference of the computed
distributions of the sum of the momenta with the experimental ones is that the computed ones have smaller values around zero.
This is more so the case for the computed results that account for the focal volume effect. This difference suggests that the
current 3D model underestimates the contribution of the delayed pathway of double ionization.

2.3 Asymmetry parameter
The asymmetry parameter

A(I, φ) =

N+(I, φ) – N–(I, φ)

is computed as a function of the intensity I and the CEP (φ). N+(I, φ) and N–(I, φ) denote the percentage of double ionization
events with ions escaping with positive and negative momentum, respectively, along the direction of the polarization of the laser
ﬁeld. Since in the 3D semiclassical model the nucleus is ﬁxed, N+(I, φ) and N–(I, φ) correspond to the percentage of double

ionization events where the sum of the two electrons momentum components along the direction of the laser ﬁeld polarization
are negative and positive, respectively. For each intensity, A(I, φ) is ﬁtted with the sinusoidal function

A(I, φ) = A0(I) sin (φ + φ0(I)).

(6)

The resulting asymmetry amplitude A0(I) and offset phase φ0(I) are plotted in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), respectively, and compared
with two sets of experimentally obtained asymmetry parameters8. The comparison shows that the 3D semiclassical model
reproduces well the decreasing pattern of A0 and the increasing pattern of φ0 with increasing intensity. However, the computed
values for these asymmetry parameters are higher than the ones obtained from the experimental results. In addition, in Fig. 5 (a)
and (b) the asymmetry parameters are plotted for each of the main two pathways of NSDI. It is shown that for both pathways the
asymmetry parameter φ0(I) has a similar pattern. The asymmetry parameter A0(I) for the delayed pathway is generally smaller
which suggests that for the delayed pathway the two electron momentum components are more spread out in all four quadrants
than for the direct ionization pathway. This is indeed shown in the correlated momenta presented in Fig. 6 in the next section.

2.4 Correlated momenta as a function of intensity: transition from strong to soft recollisions
For intensities ranging from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to 5×1014W/cm2, the correlated momenta for the direct and delayed double
ionization pathways are plotted in Fig. 6. For the smaller intensity of 0.85×1014 W/cm2 the computed correlated momenta

resemble but do not quite have the cross-shape pattern of the measured results, see Fig. 6. There are fewer double ionization
events with both momenta being close to zero than in the experimentally obtained cross-shaped pattern6, 8. These close-to-zero
momenta also reduce the asymmetry parameter. Thus, the reduced number of such events produced in our calculation is in
accord with computing an asymmetry parameter A0(I) that is larger than the experimental one, see Fig. 5. The cross-shaped
pattern is better reproduced by the delayed double ionization pathway, see Fig. 6. In addition, from an analysis of the classical
trajectories it is found that for 63% of the delayed pathway of double ionization the initially bound electron ionizes after the
tunneling electron following recollision while for 37% it is the other way around. The electron that ionizes second does so
generally with a smaller momentum. It is found that the correlated momenta when the tunneling electron ionizes second
resembles more a cross-shaped pattern, see Fig. 7. Moreover, as in the observed correlated momenta in ref.8, the computed
correlated momenta transition to the well-known pattern for intermediate intensities26. This pattern involves both electrons
escaping in the same direction either parallel or antiparallel to the laser ﬁeld, thus, giving rise to a much higher probability
density in the ﬁrst and third quadrants of the correlated momenta, rather than the second and fourth ones. This is the pattern of
the correlated momenta for the direct pathway of double ionization at intensities 2-4×1014 W/cm2. At these intensities the
direct pathway of double ionization is the prevailing one.

A less known pattern is that observed experimentally and retrieved computationally with the 3D semiclassical model for
intensities above 4×1014 W/cm2, see Fig. 6. For these higher intensities, it is found that the two electrons escape mostly with
opposite momenta for a signiﬁcant number of double ionization events. To identify the reason for this shift, in Fig. 8, the
time electron 1 tunnel-ionizes and the recollision time are plotted for three different intensities, namely, 1014 W/cm2, 3×1014
W/cm2 and 5×1014 W/cm2 and for two different CEP’s, namely, φ = 15◦ and φ = 105◦ for each intensity. The tunneling time of
electron 1 is found to be close to the times corresponding to the extrema of the laser ﬁeld for all three intensities. However, the
distribution of the recollision time is found to shift from times corresponding roughly to zeros of the laser ﬁeld for an intensity
of 1014 W/cm2 to times corresponding to the extrema of the laser ﬁeld for an intensity of 5×1014 W/cm2. The transfer of
energy from electron 1 to electron 2 is much smaller for the soft recollisions. For these higher intensities, where soft recollisions
prevail, the momentum of electron 1 is mostly determined from the vector potential at the tunneling time. The momentum
of electron 2 is determined by the vector potential shortly after recollision takes place which is roughly half a laser cycle
after electron 1 tunnel-ionizes. As a result the two electrons escape mostly with opposite momenta. This mechanism of soft
recollisions for higher intensities was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a theoretical study of strongly-driven N2 with ﬁxed nuclei20.

The contribution to the correlated momenta of the direct and delayed pathways of double ionization is shown in Fig. 6.
For the direct pathway, for intensities from 0.85×1014 W/cm2 to 4×1014W/cm2 the probability density is signiﬁcantly higher
in the ﬁrst and third quadrants of the correlated momenta than in the second and fourth ones. This is a known pattern. For
strong recollisions, the two electron momentum components along the direction of the laser ﬁeld are both determined from the
vector potential at times just larger than the recollision time. Thus, both electrons escape with similar momenta in the direction
along the polarization of the laser ﬁeld. For an intensity of 5×1014 W/cm2 soft recollisions prevail and, as discussed above, the
two electrons escape mostly with opposite momenta along the direction of the polarization of the laser ﬁeld. For the delayed

pathway, this opposite momenta pattern, demonstrated with much higher probability density in the second and fourth quadrants
of the correlated momenta, sets in at lower intensities, 3×1014 W/cm2, see Fig. 6. This is consistent with a smaller transfer
of energy taking place from electron 1 to electron 2 at the recollision time in the delayed pathway compared to the energy
transfer in the direct pathway. Regarding small intensities, in Fig. 6 it is shown that the computed correlated momenta due to
the delayed pathway have a pattern similar to but not quite cross-shaped.

results hold for all other CEPs. Grey line denotes the laser ﬁeld. The light blue arrows indicate the mapping of a tunneling-time
peak to a recollision-time peak.

2.5 Correlated momenta and double ionization pathways as a function of CEP
In what follows, the dependence of the correlated momenta on the CEP is investigated at an intensity of 0.85×1014 W/cm2.
In Fig. 9, the correlated momenta are plotted for φ ranging from 15◦ to 345◦ with a step of 30◦. Due to the symmetry of
the Hamiltonian, when φ → φ + 180◦ then p → –p. With this symmetry in mind, the experimental results from ref.27 are
plotted in Fig. 9 for φ ranging from 15◦ to 165◦ and the computed results are plotted for φ ranging from 195◦ to 345◦. A
very good agreement is found between the computed and the experimental results. Speciﬁcally, the computed correlated
momenta correctly reproduce the overall observed pattern for each individual CEP. A difference between the computed and
the experimental results is that the former results are more concentrated on the ﬁrst and third quadrants suggesting that the
computations overestimate the contribution of the direct pathway. To better understand the change of the correlated momenta
pattern as a function of the CEP plotted in Fig. 9, in Fig. 10 the percentage of the direct and delayed pathways of double
ionization events are plotted as a function of the CEP. At an intensity of 0.85×1014 W/cm2 the delayed pathway has the largest
contribution for CEPs φ = 45◦ and φ = 225◦, while it has the smallest for CEPs φ = 165◦ and φ = 345◦. In Fig. 9, a comparison
of the correlated momenta between φ = 45◦ and φ = 165◦ shows that there is higher probability density for both electrons
to ionize with the same large momentum for φ = 165◦ than for φ = 45◦. This is indeed consistent with the direct ionization
pathway having a larger contribution for φ = 165◦ than for φ = 45◦ as shown in Fig. 10. Similar conclusions can be drawn by
comparing the correlated momenta for φ = 345◦ with the one for φ = 225◦. From Fig. 10, it is found that the contribution of
each of the two main pathways of double ionization vary roughly by 20% as a function of the CEP for the smallest intensity of
0.85×1014 W/cm2.

3 Conclusions

Using a 3D semiclassical model we investigated the dependence of double ionization observables on the intensity and on
the carrier envelope phase of a near-single-cycle near-infrared laser ﬁeld employed to drive Ar. The good agreement of the
computed results with recent experiments employing near-single-cycle laser pulses6, 8, 27, adds to previous successes of this
3D model in identifying features of non-sequential double ionization of two-electron atoms when driven by many-cycle laser
pulses11, 15, 19. A difference between the computed and the experimental results was found to be a lower value of the distribution
of the sum of the two electron momentum components along the direction of the polarization of the laser ﬁeld and a lower
value around zero of the correlated momenta. This seems to suggest that the current 3D model overestimates the Coulomb
attraction of each electron from the nucleus. Future studies can improve on the 3D model for many electron atoms such as Ar
by using more accurate effective potentials for the time propagation. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the main pathways
of double ionization, that is, the direct and the delayed pathways, both signiﬁcantly contribute at all intensities currently

the CEP for an intensity of 0.85×1014 W/cm2 and it was shown that the results obtained are consistent with features of the

anti-correlation momentum pattern at higher intensities20, is observed experimentally in the context of strongly-driven Ar8 and
also reproduced in the current work for strongly-driven Ar by a near-single-cycle laser ﬁeld. It is shown that this anti-correlation
pattern is due to soft recollisions with recollision times close to the extrema of the laser ﬁeld.
