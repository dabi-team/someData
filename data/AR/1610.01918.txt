ABSTRACT

Context. A subclass of broad EUV and X-ray jets, called blowout jets, have become a topic of research since they could be the link
between standard collimated jets and CMEs.
Aims. Our aim is to understand the origin of a series of broad jets, some accompanied by ﬂares and associated with narrow and
jet-like CMEs.
Methods. We analyze observations of a series of recurrent broad jets observed in AR 10484 on 21 – 24 October 2003. In particular,
one of them occurred simultaneously with an M2.4 ﬂare on 23 October at 02:41 UT (SOLA2003-10-23). Both events were observed
by ARIES Hα Solar Tower-Telescope, TRACE, SOHO, and RHESSI instruments. The ﬂare was very impulsive and followed by a
narrow CME. A local force-free model of AR 10484 is the basis to compute its topology. We ﬁnd bald patches (BPs) at the ﬂare site.
This BP topology is present for at least two days before. Large-scale ﬁeld lines, associated with the BPs, represent open loops. This
is conﬁrmed by a global PFSS model. Following the brightest leading edge of the Hα and EUV jet emission, we can temporarily
associate it with a narrow CME.
Results. Considering their characteristics, the observed broad jets appear to be of the blowout class. As the most plausible scenario,
we propose that magnetic reconnection could occur at the BP separatrices forced by the destabilization of a continuously reformed
ﬂux rope underlying them. The reconnection process could bring the cool ﬂux-rope material into the reconnected open ﬁeld lines
driving the series of recurrent blowout jets and accompanying CMEs.
Conclusions. Based on a model of the coronal ﬁeld, we compute the AR 10484 topology at the location where ﬂaring and blowout
jets occurred from 21 to 24 October 2003. This topology can consistently explain the origin of these events.

Key words. Sun: magnetic ﬁelds, Sun: ﬂares, Sun: jets, Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs), Sun: X-rays, gamma rays

1. Introduction

Plasma ejected from the Sun in transient phenomena is observed
over a large spatial, temporal, and wavelength range. From
full-ﬂeshed bright coronal mass ejections (CMEs) going through
faint CMEs and narrow CMEs (observed in white-light corona-
graphs) to blowout and the more standard collimated jets seen
in X-rays and EUV, there seems to exist a continuum of ejective
events playing a key role in the dynamics of the corona and the
solar wind.

Hundhausen et al. (1984) formulated the classic deﬁnition
of CME as “an observable change in coronal structure that (1)
occurs on a timescale between a few minutes and several hours
and (2) involves the appearance of a new, discrete, bright white-

light feature in the coronagraph ﬁeld of view”, which was later
updated by Schwenn (2006). However, a wealth of morpholo-
gies complies with this deﬁnition, which inspired several at-
tempts to categorize solar ejections, such as those by Howard
et al. (1985) and Burkepile & St. Cyr (1993), including classes
such as loop, halo, fan, blob, jet, spike, among others. With
time, the concept of a regular CME has evolved to refer to a
bubble-like eruption of signiﬁcant angular width (i.e. > 400),
which may show the three-part structure of a bright leading
edge, a dark void, and a bright core (three-part CME; Illing &
Hundhausen 1985), or simply ,a bright front after which a clear
cavity and/or a bright core cannot be discerned (loop-CME).
Recently, Vourlidas et al. (2013) classiﬁed CMEs reported by
the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) CME Cat-
alog (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list; Yashiro et al. 2004),

from the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO)
instrument (Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard Solar and Helio-
spheric Observatory (SOHO), into categories exhibiting a ﬂux-
rope structure, namely the three-part and the loop CME types,
and categories without a clear ﬂux rope structure, which in-
cluded jets and outﬂows. Their jet category includes events with
angular widths ≤ 400, lacking a sharp front and detailed sub-
structure or circular morphology, while their outﬂow category
comprises wider events without a clear loop front or cavity that
may contain ﬁlamentary material. Yashiro et al. (2003) investi-
gated the properties of hundreds of narrow CMEs of the CDAW
SOHO/LASCO Catalog, with narrow CMEs being deﬁned as
events with angular width ≤ 200. They recognized that many
narrow CMEs may not be listed in the catalog because they are
too faint and it is diﬃcult to identify them. Faint CMEs of all
widths may be attributed either to a scarcity of material asso-
ciated with the event or to a signiﬁcant propagation component
away from the observer’s plane of the sky (POS) (e.g., Cremades
et al. 2015).

Coronal jets were ﬁrst observed in detail by the Soft X-
ray Telescope (SXT) onboard the Japanese mission Yohkoh.
Yohkoh/SXT data revealed the characteristics of large and en-
ergetic jets (Shibata et al. 1992a; Shimojo et al. 1996, 1998;
Shimojo & Shibata 2000). Observations in X-rays and EUV
show that they are collimated, beam-like structures, typically
anchored in coronal bright points, and best seen inside polar
coronal holes against the dark background. Polar coronal jets
were studied by Wang et al. (1998) using data from LASCO
and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard
SOHO. Hinode has also provided data on polar jet parameters,
such as lifetime, length, transverse width, and speed (Savcheva
et al. 2007; Moreno-Insertis et al. 2008; Filippov et al. 2009).
Typical jet durations are from tens of minutes to more than one
hour (Savcheva et al. 2007; Cirtain et al. 2007), lengths are in
the range 1–20 × 104 km, widths in the range 1–4 × 104 km,
and speeds range from 150 km s−1 to over 800 km s−1 (Shimojo
et al. 1996; Cirtain et al. 2007). Nisticò et al. (2009) built the
ﬁrst catalog of polar jets observed by the Sun Earth Connection
Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) onboard the
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), while Nis-
ticò et al. (2010) did the same for equatorial jets ﬁnding no dif-
ference between their typical characteristics. Moore et al. (2010)
introduced the concept of blowout jet to distinguish a series of
events among the just described jets, and named the remaining
ones standard jets. We follow the nomenclature of these authors
throughout this article. Blowout jets show an initial phase simi-
lar to that of standard jets starting with a brightening at its base
and a narrow spire; this is followed by a violent ﬂux rope erup-
tion and the consequent broadening of the spire (see also Sterling
et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011; Madjarska 2011; Moore et al. 2013).
For a review on observations, theory, and modeling of coronal
jets see Raouaﬁ et al. (2016).

Magnetic reconnection is the mechanism generally accepted
for energy release during jets, ﬂares, and several CME models
(see the review by Schmieder et al. 2015, for CME initiation
mechanisms). In what kind of magnetic conﬁgurations they oc-
cur and how is reconnection forced or driven to trigger these
active events give raise to diﬀerent theoretical and numerical
models. Models used to explain jets diﬀer according to the ﬂow
pattern observed and/or imposed at the photosphere and their
magnetic conﬁguration.
In these lines, one ﬁnds emergence-
ﬂux models (Heyvaerts et al. 1977; Shibata et al. 1992b) and
cancelling-ﬂux models (Priest et al. 1994, see also Longcope
(1998)). To drive magnetic reconnection in numerical simula-

tions, Moreno-Insertis et al. (2008), Moreno-Insertis & Gals-
gaard (2013), Török et al. (2009), Gontikakis et al. (2009), Ar-
chontis et al. (2010), and Fang et al. (2014), among others, pro-
pose the presence of ﬂux emergence; while, Pariat et al. (2009b,
2010, 2015) force the magnetic conﬁguration imposing hori-
zontal photospheric twisting motions. The used magnetic ﬁeld
topology includes, in all cases, a coronal magnetic null-point;
the model analyzes the build up of currents in its fan-separatrix
surface and the consequent energy release resulting in heating
and jet ejection. A topology with a null point is supported by a
large number of observations since jets were ﬁrst identiﬁed (see
the review by Raouaﬁ et al. 2016, and references therein). How-
ever, other magnetic topologies computed from coronal extrapo-
lation models have been found associated with jet observations.
Quasi-separatix layers were identiﬁed by Mandrini et al. (1996)
and Guo et al. (2013), with no magnetic null point found in any
of these studies.
In Guo et al. (2013), as in Schmieder et al.
(2013), magnetic dips and bald patches were found in the con-
ﬁgurations but their relation to the observed jets did not play any
role or was marginal. Bald patches and associated separatrices
have so far never been included in jet numerical simulations.

Jets, standard or blowout, have been observed in Hα or EUV
in association with white-light CMEs whose eruption can be
traced back to the same location in an AR (Liu et al. 2005; Liu
2008; Liu et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015). In particular, Yan et al.
(2012) studied two successive ﬂares of X-ray class M that oc-
curred in AR 10484 on 22 October 2003. Both were accom-
panied by very broad EUV jets. The one associated to the ﬁrst
M1.4 ﬂare was the most clearly seen. According to the outﬂow
velocity measurements for this ﬁrst event, these authors con-
cluded that they could trace the broad jets up to the corona and
link them to two narrow CMEs.

In this article, we describe a series of recurrent plasma ejec-
tions seen in EUV, with one observed also in Hα, from 21 to 24
October at the border of the major eastern AR 10484 sunspot.
Several of the ejections are broader and more extended than stan-
dard jets. Furthermore, most of them can be associated to jet-
like or narrow CMEs. Because of all these characteristics, we
consider them to be jets of the blowout class. All the ejections
were accompanied by simultaneous brightenings at their base,
which in a few cases developed in M-class ﬂares, as the ones
discussed by Yan et al. (2012) and the M2.4 ﬂare on 23 October
(SOL2003-10-23) analyzed in this article. All these ﬂares origi-
nated from approximately the same location in the AR and have
similar characteristics.

Our article is organized as follows. We ﬁrst describe the dif-
ferent data sets used in our analysis in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we list
all the events we identify that have an eruptive nature as those
studied by Yan et al. (2012) and the one discussed in detail in
Sect. 4. After modeling the AR magnetic ﬁeld and computing its
topology in Sect. 5, we draw a scenario that can explain the ori-
gin of the minor ﬂare brightenings, the ﬂare described in Sect. 4
as well as those analyzed by Yan et al. (2012), and the series of
blowout jets associated to all these events. Finally, in Sect. 6 we
discuss our results and conclude.

2. Observational data sets

The observational data used in this study come from sev-
eral sources. To understand the magnetic complexity of the
active region and its relation to ﬂare activity, we use the
SOHO/Michelson Doppler Imager data (MDI; Scherrer et al.
1995) with a cadence of 96 min and pixel resolution of 1.98(cid:48)(cid:48).
Hα observations were carried out at the Aryabhatta Research

R. Chandra et al.: Blowout jets and eruptive ﬂare

Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in Nainital, India,
using the 15 cm f/15 coudè solar tower-telescope equipped with
an Hα ﬁlter with a passband of 0.5 Å. The image size is enlarged
by a factor of two using a Barlow lens. The pixel resolution of
the images is 1(cid:48)(cid:48). To understand the thermal and non-thermal
nature of the studied ﬂare, we reconstructed X-ray images from
the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) using the CLEAN technique. The
evolution of the ﬂare and other associated dynamic phenomena
in EUV are studied using data from the Transition Region and
Coronal Explorer data (TRACE; Handy et al. 1999). The pixel
resolution of the images is 0.5 (cid:48)(cid:48) and the temporal cadence can
be as low as tens of seconds. TRACE observed in six EUV/UV
bands from Fe IX/X (171 Å) to C I/Fe II/UV continuum (1600 Å)
to white-light emission. We complement TRACE observations
with the SOHO/EIT (Delaboudinière et al. 1995) data. EIT ob-
served the full Sun with a cadence of 12 min and a pixel resolu-
tion of 2.36(cid:48)(cid:48) in four spectral bands centered on Fe IX/X (171 Å),
Fe XII (195 Å), Fe XV(284 Å) and He II (304 Å). The CMEs and
minor ejections associated to the observed EUV jets are identi-
ﬁed using images provided by the SOHO/LASCO C2 corona-
graph, which observes the white-light corona from about 2 to 6
RS un (Brueckner et al. 1995).

3. Recurrent broad jets in AR10484

The events discussed by Yan et al. (2012) and the ones analyzed
in this article (see Sect. 4) bear several characteristics in com-
mon. The ﬂares (all M-class) started and evolved at approxi-
mately the same location in AR 10484 and were associated with
broad jets that became CMEs, all of them within the categories
named narrow and jet-like. Motivated by these similarities, we
investigate if similar phenomena occurred in AR 10484 between
21 to 24 October 2003. We search in EIT and TRACE EUV
data and ﬁnd that recurrent jets originated from the east of AR
10484 along these days. This tendency of Hα, EUV, and X-ray
jets to appear emanating from the same region recurrently has
been observed in several examples (e.g. Schmieder et al. 1995;
Asai et al. 2001; Wang & Liu 2012; Zhang et al. 2012; Chandra
et al. 2015; Panesar et al. 2016). Our main aim in this section is
to show the frequent occurrence of the ejection of material and
to ﬁnd evidences of that ejection in LASCO C2 images. We will
not analyze all the events in detail in this section, but only those
accompanying the M2.4 ﬂare analyzed in Sect. 4.

All the jets we refer to in this section were broad and started
with a small localized brightening at their base in EIT images.
When TRACE images were available, this brightening appeared
to have a loop-like shape. In some cases an X-ray class ﬂare was
reported in GOES data (see http://www.solarmonitor.org/ for the
corresponding dates).
In general and simultaneously with the
EUV brightenings, a straight elongated mass expulsion was ob-
served towards the east of AR 10484. This broad expulsion was
observed sometimes in only one EIT image, either because its
duration was less than 12 min or because the time span between
consecutive EIT images was occasionally over 30 min. How-
ever, several jets lasted longer than 30 min. The EUV events can
be seen in a movie in Fe XII 195 Å (eit-jets-21-24.mpeg), which
is attached to this article. An example of one of these jets at its
maximum extension, together with a LASCO C2 image showing
its evidence in the upper corona, is depicted in Fig. 1.

Table 1 lists the broad jets observed from 21 October 2003
at 00:00 UT until the end of 24 October. The list includes only
the jets that are visible in 1024 × 1024 EIT direct images and ex-

tend for at least 20 EIT pixels in those images. There are many
more events originating from the east of the AR if one looks at
EIT diﬀerence images. The ﬁrst column in the table indicates
the time at which we ﬁrst detect the jet. These hours have an
estimated error of 12 min, EIT 195 Å temporal cadence. Sev-
eral of the broad jets, as the ones studied by Yan et al. (2012)
and in this article, were also observed by TRACE with much
higher temporal cadence but, since TRACE observed AR 10484
sporadically, we prefer to refer to EIT data for coherence in the
table. The second column in Table 1 shows the length of the jets
measured in projection on the solar disk from EIT direct images.
The lengths of the jets, reported at their maximum extensions,
are measured from the brightenings observed at their bases to
the brightest feature in their easternmost borders. These lengths
have been calculated using standard SolarSoft routines and range
from 44 to 243 Mm.

Finaly, the third column in Table 1 indicates if evidences of
the ejected material is found in LASCO C2 images. We include
a short description of what we observe analyzing LASCO C2
diﬀerence images, in combination with EIT diﬀerence images.
We have consulted catalogs and data bases as an alternative to
identify the white-light counterparts of AR 10484 broad jets. In
particular, we looked at the CDAW SOHO/LASCO CME Cat-
alog and the Computer Aided CME Tracking Catalog (CAC-
Tus; http://sidc.oma.be/cactus/; Robbrecht & Berghmans 2004).
These catalogs rely on diﬀerent techniques to recognize CME
events, each of them with inherent limitations. The events we
are looking for have a high chance to be small and narrow; there-
fore, most of the ones in Table 1 are identiﬁed by us and do not
appear in the catalogs. The few coronal counterparts reported
by these catalogs have been indicated by a superscript ‘Y’ and
‘R’, respectively corresponding to the CDAW SOHO/LASCO
and the CACTus CME catalogs. For the sake of consistency, we
have measured ourselves the projected angular width (AW) and
the position angle (PA) for all the LASCO C2 features reported
in Table 1.

Following the deﬁnition in Yashiro et al. (2003), all except
one of the coronal features are narrow CMEs according to their
apparent AWs. However, they could be even narrower, because
in correspondence to the location of the AR on the disk, the
propagation direction of these events could have an important
component towards SOHO, which produces a broader projected
AW in the coronagraph images. Still, as hinted by the broad jets
seen in projection on the solar disk in EIT images, the propaga-
tion direction of these events must have a signiﬁcant component
towards the east. We have indicated by ‘high angle’ those white-
light counterparts that presumably propagated at a larger angle
with respect to the POS. Also in Table 1, ‘jet-like CME’ indi-
cates that the observed structure was long and very collimated,
with hardly any evident structure, while a narrow CME was seen
as being structured and in general having larger AWs than jet-
like CMEs. The position angles (PAs) reported in Table 1 lie
within ± 5 ◦.

We do not attempt to study in detail the temporal correla-
tion between all the EUV broad jets and the LASCO C2 features
listed in Table 1, instead we do this in Sect. 4 for the M2.4 ﬂare
and its associated jet on 23 October. We just aim to show that a
white-light counterpart can be found for several of the broad jets
observed from 21 to 24 October 2003 originating from the east-
ern side of AR 10484. By 25 October 2003, the broad-jet recur-
rency associated with white-light LASCO features is no longer
evident (see Uddin et al. 2012).

Notes. An * in the third column indicates that the association with the corresponding jet is marginal. A superscript ‘Y’ and ‘R’ indicates that the
coronal counterpart was respectively reported to the CDAW SOHO/LASCO and the CACTus CME catalogs. The words ‘high angle’ indicate a
large angle between the observed structure and the POS. The hours indicate the ﬁrst time of appearance in LASCO C2 ﬁeld-of-view (FOV). The
angular width (AW) and the position angle (PA) are expressed in degrees, with the PA measured counter-clockwise from solar north.

4. Multiwavelength view of the M2.4 ﬂare and jet in

AR 10484

4.1. Magnetic ﬁeld evolution from 21 to 24 October 2003

AR 10484 was a very complex region that appeared on the
eastern solar limb on 18 October 2003 and could be followed
until it rotated out to the far side of the Sun on 31 Octo-
ber. By 23 October it exhibited a βγδ conﬁguration (see
http://www.solarmonitor.org/) and was formed by ﬁve major
sunspots and several minor ones. It was a highly ﬂare-productive
AR during its disk transit whose events amounted to 29 C-
class, 16 M-class, and 2 X-class ﬂares (see e.g., Li et al. 2005;
Zharkova et al. 2006; Yan et al. 2012; Uddin et al. 2012, for the
analysis of some of these events).

In Fig. 2 we show the evolution of the line of sight (LOS)
magnetic ﬁeld as seen with MDI from 21 October until late 23
October. This evolution was analyzed in detail in Yan et al.
(2012), together with the changes seen in TRACE white-light
images. These authors observed the rotation towards the south-

west of a large and a small negative sunspots located to the north-
east of the AR for around 48 hr in the counter-clockwise direc-
tion. The large sunspot rotated around the major northern nega-
tive spot (see their Fig. 1), which is pointed with a white arrow
in Fig. 2a. The rotation is also evident when one compares the
diﬀerent panels in Fig. 2. As a result of this sustained rotation,
the positive magnetic polarities located between the rotating spot
and a southern and smaller negative one, as also other positive
polarities to the east, were continuously cancelled and ﬁnally
they practically disappeared, remaining visible only a small pos-
itive patch in Fig. 2f. A particular example of this cancellation
and approach between positive and negative polarites can be seen
in Fig. 2 of Yan et al. (2012). Zhang et al. (2003) described
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of AR 10484 using the Huairou

The two red continuous lines are drawn to indicate the CME angular width. Notice a very weak feature to the north of the CME bulk emission.
This feature could appear due to projection eﬀect because the CME propagation direction has an important component towards the observer, as
deduced from the source region location. If we take it as the northern CME edge, then, the AW would be of ≈ 23 ◦, while the true width of the
ejection is smaller. The broad feature to the south corresponds to a previous CME. The coronal evolution in the region indicated by the white
rectangle is available as a movie in the online edition. These white and red rectangles partially overlap to the north and west.

marked with an arrow the location of a major negative sunspot around which a northern sunspot rotated from the north-east to the south-west. The
ellipses indicate the approximate location of the ﬂare and jet activity along those days. The images are derotated to Sun center and the size of the
ﬁeld of view (FOV) is 290 per 200(cid:48)(cid:48). The images have been saturated below (above) -500 G (500 G). We have added three contours to panel (e) at

that the shear at the location of the rotating spot and surround-
ing ﬁeld was high and was constantly being built up by the spot
motion.

In our view, the constant ﬂux cancellation could be at the ori-
gin of the ﬂaring and broad jet expulsions along this time period.
We have added a red ellipse at approximately the location of EIT
and TRACE brightenings and jets in panels a to f of Fig. 2. The
exact brightening location and jet origin may change within the
ellipses considering the dynamic evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld
(see in the next sections the detailed analysis of the ﬂare and jet

at 02:41 UT on 23 October). Taking into account the numbers of
events listed in Table 1, the importance of the ﬂares observed in
AR10484 (see Yan et al. 2012, , and the ﬂare analyzed in this ar-
ticle), and the MDI evolution in Fig. 2, we conjecture that when
magnetic ﬂux cancellation was higher the activity with diﬀerent
brightness intensites and jets was more frequent and decreased
as the positive ﬂux mostly disappeared.

In the aftermath of the broad jets and ﬂares discussed in this
article, i.e. on 25 October, Hα and EUV activity in the form of
minor ﬂares and surges, continued to be observed to the east of

overlaying TRACE images in 1700 Å. The RHESSI images
are reconstructed using the CLEAN algorithm with the natural
weighting scheme and the front detector segments 3 to 8 (exclud-
ing 7) (Hurford et al. 2002); this implies that RHESSI’s spatial
esolution is at most ≈ 7(cid:48)(cid:48). The low energy emission (i.e. 10–15
keV) originates from a single compact source from the ﬂare very
beginning (∼02:34 UT) until ∼02:48 UT. We have further recon-
structed images in other energy bands (not shown here), namely,
6–12, 15–25 keV and found that the extension of the sources, as
well as their spatial locations, at these energies are similar to the
10–15 keV source.

A careful examination of series of TRACE 1700 Å images
shows that the earliest signature of ﬂare activity appeared at
∼02:30 UT in the form of a localized brightening with a short
elongation towards the east of the AR. The TRACE FOV, with a
size of 768 × 768 pixels, covered the full AR 10484 until ∼2:39
UT, after that hour it reduced to 512 × 512 pixels leaving the
west side of the AR without coverage. At ∼02:35 UT, the in-
tensity of the localized brightening, then seen as two separate
kernels, increased suddenly and a jet-like ejection became very
prominent. This phase is clearly reﬂected in the GOES X-ray
proﬁle as its initial bump.

At ∼02:38 UT, the ﬂaring region developed rapidly. The
southern brightening became structured and splitted in two. With
the continuous intensity increase, three bright kernels became
evident. Between ∼02:38 and 02:40 UT, the HXR light curves
show two impulsive peaks. Two HXR sources were observed
for a brief period during this interval of time in the 50–100 keV
energy band, these were approximately cospatial with the UV
ﬂare kernels (Fig. 4d). Although the ﬂaring region is very com-
pact, the low energy emission (10–15 keV) at this time origi-
nated from a zone between the two HXR sources. We interpret
that the HXR sources, observed in the 50–100 keV energy band,
mark the footpoints (FPs) of a closed loop-system at approxi-
mately the base of the jet in the compact ﬂaring region. The
HXR emission from the FPs is traditionally viewed in terms of
the thick-target bremsstrahlung process (Brown 1971) in which
X-ray production takes place when high-energy electrons, ac-
celerated at the reconnection site, come along the guiding mag-
netic ﬁeld lines and penetrate the denser transition region and
chromospheric layers (Kontar et al. 2010). In view of this “stan-
dard" picture, it is very likely that the HXR emission at lower
X-ray energies (e.g., 10–15 keV) originated from the top of the
ﬂaring region. When examining the polarity of the ﬁeld at the
place of the high-energy HXR sources, we ﬁnd that the sources
are mostly located in regions of opposite polarity ﬁeld (compare
panels (a) and (d) in Fig. 4 and see panel (c) in Fig. 10).

4.2.2. The spectral evolution

We study the evolution of RHESSI X-ray spectra during the
impulsive phase of the ﬂare (i.e., between 02:37:00 UT and
02:41:00 UT). For this analysis, we ﬁrst generate a RHESSI
spectrogram with an energy binning of 1
3 keV from 6–15 keV
and 1 keV from 15–100 keV. We use only the front segments of
the detectors and exclude detectors 2 and 7, which have lower
energy resolution and high threshold energies, respectively. The
spectra are deconvolved with the full detector response ma-
trix (i.e. oﬀ-diagonal elements are included, Smith et al. 2002).
Spectral ﬁts are obtained using a forward-ﬁtting method imple-
mented in the Object Spectral Executive (OSPEX) code. OS-
PEX allows the user to choose a model photon spectrum, which

count rates are averaged over every 4 sec. To allow for the comparison
of these curves, the RHESSI count rates are scaled by factors of 1, 1/5,
1/10, and 1/60 in the energy bands 6–12, 12–25, 25–50, and 50–100
keV, respectively.

the large major negative spot and to the north of the region within
the red ellipse in Fig. 2. These phenomena were discussed by
Uddin et al. (2012), who suggested that magnetic reconnection
between small dispersed polarities during the sunspot decay and
prexisting ﬁelds could result in these active events. In these ex-
amples, the plasma is not injected into open ﬁeld lines but into
large closed loops that connect to the distant AR 10486 to the
south-east of AR 10484 (see Fig. 6 in Uddin et al. 2012).

4.2. The ﬂare and jet in X-rays and UV continuum

4.2.1. The temporal and spatial evolution

The temporal evolution of the X-ray emision of the M2.4 X-class
ﬂare on 23 October is shown in Fig. 3 using GOES (top) and
RHESSI (bottom) data. GOES measurements in the 0.5–4.0 Å
channel show a small ﬂux enhancement at ∼02:34 UT, indicating
the onset of minor ﬂaring in the AR. A small bump in GOES
proﬁles at ∼02:38 UT, i.e. before the maximum, is noteworthy.
This is followed by a signiﬁcant increase in the X-ray ﬂux in
GOES, as well as in RHESSI light curves. The GOES proﬁles
peak around 02:41 UT.

RHESSI (Lin et al. 2002) observed this event from begin-
ning to end. We analyze RHESSI emission in four energy bands,
namely, 6 – 12, 12 – 25, 25 – 50, and 50 – 100 keV. RHESSI light
curves, shown in Fig. 3 (bottom panel), are constructed taking
the average count rates over the front detectors 1, 3–6, 8, and 9
in each energy band. The low energy RHESSI light curves show
an evolution similar to that of GOES. At higher energies, the
light curves present an impulsive behavior. The ﬂare produced
signiﬁcant hard X-ray (HXR) emission with energies up to ≈50–
100 keV; this is quite interesting considering that the ﬂare was
quite compact (see Fig. 4). The early subtle rise observed be-
tween ∼02:34 and 02:38 UT in the 0.5–4.0 Å GOES light curves
is also quite prominent in the 12–25 keV X-ray energy band.

range, while the light green contours to the 50–100 keV one. The integration time for each RHESSI image is 1 min. The contour levels are 40%,
70%, and 95% of the peak ﬂux in each image. We have overlaid the same isocountors of the MDI magnetogram at 01:35 UT, shown in Fig. 2e,

kept as such even when TRACE FOV size changed (see the black band to the west of panels (d), (e), and (f) and explanations in the text). The

is convolved with the instrument response matrix and then ﬁtted
to the observed count spectrum. The best-ﬁt parameters are ob-
tained as output. We use the bremsstrahlung and line spectrum of
an isothermal plasma and a power-law function with a turnover
at low X-ray energies. The negative power-law index below the
low energy turnover is ﬁxed to 1.5.
In this manner, there are
ﬁve free parameters in the model: the temperature (T) and emis-
sion measure (EM) for the thermal component, the power-law
index (γ), the normalization of the power-law, and the low en-
ergy turnover for the non-thermal component. From these ﬁts
we can derive the T and EM of the hot ﬂaring plasma, as well as
the power law index for the non-thermal component.

In Fig. 5 we show the spatially-integrated and background-
subtracted RHESSI spectra derived during nine time intervals of
the impulsive phase of the ﬂare together with the applied spectral
ﬁts. Each spectrum is accumulated over 20 sec. The RHESSI
X-ray time proﬁles reveal that the early impulsive phase emis-
sion (∼02:37–02:38 UT) originates only at low X-ray energies
(i.e. ≈6–40 keV, cf. Fig. 3). We ﬁnd a rapid increase in the X-
ray ﬂux in HXR energies up to 50–100 keV after ∼02:38 UT.
Therefore, we have restricted the spectral ﬁtting during the early
phase (between 02:37 and 02:38 UT) to the energy range 6–40
keV (cf. Fig. 5a–b). The spectra derived during the main impul-
sive phase (between 02:38 and 02:41 UT) are ﬁtted in the range
6–100 keV.

The spectra during the early phase (02:37:00–02:38:00 UT)
show lower values of T and EM, indicating that the X-ray emis-
sion comes from localized regions. The TRACE UV images (see
Fig. 4) clearly show localized brightenings in this interval. At
X-ray energies >10 keV, the spectrum shows a steep power law
with a photon spectral index of ≈7. The ﬂare emission undergoes
a very fast spectral evolution with the onset of high energy emis-
sion at ∼02:38 UT. The HXR emission is the hardest between
02:38:20 and 02:39:00 UT with a photon spectral index γ of ≈4
(cf. Fig. 5(d) and e). It is important to note that there is a decrease
in temperature during this interval, indicating the dominance of
the non-thermal characteristics of the emission. The tempera-
ture, as well as the emission measure, increase continuoulsy in
the later stages while the slopes of HXR spectra steepen. This

pattern in the evolution of HXR spectra, often called the soft-
hard-soft spectral behavior, suggests that the phase of the hardest
X-ray spectra is intimately associated with electron acceleration
events (Grigis & Benz 2004; Joshi et al. 2011, 2012). The phase
of the hardest X-ray emission is characterized by rapid changes
in the ﬂaring region in the UV images (Fig. 4) with the evolution
of ﬂare kernels. The HXR footpoints are brieﬂy visible during
this interval only.

4.3. The ﬂare and jet in Hα

The Hα ﬂare evolution is shown in Fig. 6. In this wavelength,
the ﬂare initiated around 02:30 UT, peaked around 02:37 UT
and decayed around 02:50 UT. Similar to what happened in X-
rays, the ﬂare was very impulsive. It started with the ejection
of dark, cool material towards the east. This was later followed
by a bright, long, and broad jet as the material heated up when
moving into the corona. The jet continued as the ﬂare evolved
and was no longer visible at 02:39 UT; however, the ﬂare bright-
enings were visible up to 02:50 UT. The broad jet reached its
maximum length during the ﬂare peak. At the footpoints of the
jet, we observe three compact Hα kernels, called K1, K2, and K3
in Fig. 6d. Kernels K1 and K2 are located to the south-west and
K3 to the north-east of what seems to be the base of the jet, re-
spectively. Initially kernels K1 and K2 appear as a single bright
patch and later they separate. We have added three MDI con-
tours to Fig. 6c to show the ﬂare brigthening locations relative to
the magnetic ﬁeld.

4.4. The jet and its extension in a narrow CME

To study the kinematics of the jet, we create a time-slice dia-
gram using the Hα observations. The result of this analysis is
presented in the left panel of Fig. 7. The position of the slice
along which we measure the distance of the brightest broad jet
feature in function of time is shown by a white dashed line in
panel (e) of Fig. 6. Based on this analysis, we compute the pro-
jected velocity of the jet. This velocity is ≈ 220 km s−1 and the

low energies (dashed line). The gray solid line indicates the sum of the two components. The spectrum during the early impulsive phase (panels a

maximum projected height achieved by the Hα jet is 80 Mm with
respect to its bright base (see also the height-time plot in the right
panel of Fig. 7). Notice that we estimate a projected length of ≈
215 Mm in the direct 195 Å EIT images (see Table 1), which
is consistent with the fact that the hot material is better seen in
this wavelength range at greater coronal heights. As mentioned

in Sect. 3 the later estimation is done by measuring the distance
of the brightest EUV feature in the jet with respect to its base at
the time we observe the jet achieved its maximum length. Tak-
ing into account the poor temporal resolution of EIT images, we
have not estimated a velocity from the EUV images.

to panel (c) in continuous magenta (cyan) line for positive (negative) ﬁeld. The three brightest kernels have been labelled as K1, K2, and K3 in
panel (d). All images have a FOV of 290 per 200(cid:48)(cid:48), similar to that of Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. The white dashed line in panel (e) indicates the direction
along which the height-time measurements in Fig. 7 are performed.

As shown in Table 1, the ﬂare studied here can be associ-
ated with the narrow CME ﬁrst seen in LASCO C2 at 03:06
UT for which we measure an AW of 20◦. According to the
CDAW SOHO/LASCO Catalog, the CME speed was 656 km
s−1. If we do a backward extrapolation of the LASCO Catalog’s
height-time plot, which exhibits an almost linear proﬁle, we ﬁnd
that the approximate start time of the CME on the solar surface
was 02:34 UT, which is consistent with the initiation time of the
broad jet from the ﬂaring region.

In the right panel of Fig. 7, we have added the EIT measure-
ment of the projected jet height and of the associated CME, in the
C2 FOV according to CDAW catalog, to the height-time plot of
the Hα jet. If we ﬁt linearly the EUV measurement and LASCO
C2 values, we ﬁnd a velocity of ≈ 770 km s−1 with a linear corre-
lation coeﬃcient of 0.99. This value is ≈ 17% larger than that of
LASCO C2, which is reasonable considering the diﬀerent kinds
of measurements we are comparing. However, when adding the
Hα measurement into the picture, we ﬁnd that the ejected mate-
rial ﬁrst undergoes a phase of gradual acceleration, to reach later
an almost constant speed. Fig. 8 illustrates the jet as observed
with EIT at 02:36 UT and the associated narrow CME.

5. On the origin of ﬂares and jets in AR 10484

5.1. The local magnetic-ﬁeld model

In this and following sections, we compute the coronal AR mag-
netic ﬁeld and compute its topological structure searching for
clues about the origin of the observed ﬂares and broad jets from
21 to 24 October 2003.

The LOS magnetic ﬁeld of the AR is extrapolated using the
linear force free ﬁeld (LFFF) approximation (∇×B = αB, where
B is the magnetic ﬁeld and α is the force-free parameter, which is
assumed to be constant in the entire extrapolation box) with the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method described in Alissandrakis
(1981) and Démoulin et al. (1997). As a boundary condition for
the model, we use the MDI magnetograms closest in time to the
observed events. The only free parameter on which the LFFF
model depends on, α, is chosen so that the computed ﬁeld lines
match the observed coronal loops. To compare our computed
ﬁeld lines to the observed loops, we select a 171 Å TRACE im-

the jet and the narrow CME. The left panel shows the time-slice di-
agram built along the white dashed line shown on the Hα image at
02:37:48 UT (Fig. 6e). The right panel is a height-time plot combining
the Hα measurements of the jet length projected on the POS (vertical
crosses), a similar measurement done on the EIT image at 02:48 UT (di-

age. TRACE images were available only in 1600 Å, 1700 Å, and
white light during the ﬂare and jet on 23 October; therefore, we
use the closest in time (∼19:58 UT) 171 Å image on the previ-
ous day, which is shown in Fig. 9 side by side to the model with
computed ﬁeld lines overlaid on it. The value of α is selected via
a recurrent process, as discussed in Green et al. (2002). The α
value that best matches TRACE loops is -1.9 × 10−3 Mm−1. Our
model includes also a transformation of coordinates from the lo-
cal AR frame to the observed one (see Démoulin et al. 1997),
so that the computed ﬁeld lines can be directly compared to the
observed loops. For more details about how the computational
box is selected and its size controlled, see Mandrini et al. (2015).

sides of the box (deﬁned in the local frame) indicates that the AR was not at central meridian at that time.

5.2. Magnetic topology at the ﬂare and jet location

5.2.1. BPs: Their general characteristics and relevance

Typical coronal conditions imply that the magnetic ﬁeld is force
free and frozen into the plasma almost everywhere in solar
ARs. Separatrices are an exception where current layers may be
formed and energy release is prone to occur. Apart from cases
in which magnetic null-points are present, separatrices can only
appear in a magnetic volume when some ﬁeld lines touch tan-

gentially the boundary (i.e. the photosphere). This may happen
along portions of the photospheric inversion line (PIL) of the
magnetic ﬁeld component normal to this boundary. These por-
tions are called “bald patches” or BPs (Titov et al. 1993). At a BP
the ﬁeld lines are curved upwards and the horizontal component
of the magnetic ﬁeld crosses the inversion line from the negative
to the positive polarity (i.e. in the opposite way when compared
to normal portions of the PIL). The conditions for the existence
of a BP were ﬁrst given by Seehafer (1986) and in more detail

Article number, page 10 of 15

R. Chandra et al.: Blowout jets and eruptive ﬂare

by Titov et al. (1993). BPs are present when, at z = 0 (i.e. the
boundary or photosphere), Bz = 0 and B.∇Bz > 0.

BPs deﬁne separatrices where current layers can develop
(see e.g., Low & Wolfson 1988; Vekstein et al. 1991; Aly &
Amari 1997). Karpen et al. (1991) discussed this aspect and
showed that the thickness of the low chromosphere could pre-
vent thin current-sheets to form in a BP conﬁguration. However,
Billinghurst et al. (1993) explained that strong currents could de-
velop at least near the footpoints of the BP separatrix because a
strong concentration of ﬂux tubes could be present in these re-
gions. More recently, Pariat et al. (2009b) showed that currents
can accumulate at BPs and their separatrices in MHD numercial
simulations; while other simulations like those by Archontis &
Hood (2009), Archontis et al. (2013), Cheung et al. (2010), and
Takasao et al. (2015) have shown the development of magnetic
reconnection at BPs during the build up of ARs.

When going to observations, there is evidence of the pres-
ence of BPs in ﬂares. The ﬁrst examples were implicitly shown
by Seehafer & Staude (1980) and Seehafer (1985). Aulanier
et al. (1998) found a close correspondence between BP sep-
aratrices and Hα and X-ray kernels in a small ﬂare. Delan-
née & Aulanier (1999) studied a ﬂare associated to BPs, where
reconnection could have originated a CME. Concerning other
type of events, Fletcher et al. (2001) found that transition region
brightenings associated with BPs had abundances close to pho-
tospheric values. Mandrini et al. (2002) discussed a non-typical
scenario in which interacting BPs were related to the formation
of arch-ﬁlament systems and a Hα surge. Wang et al. (2002)
found soft X-ray elongated features associated to BPs preceding
an X-class ﬂare and CME. Pariat et al. (2004) discussed the rel-
evance of BPs for the emergence of undulatory ﬂux tubes and
Ellerman bombs (see also Pariat et al. 2009b), while more re-
cently, a scenario involving U-loops evolving into BPs with re-
connection at their location was proposed by Peter et al. (2014)
to explain Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) obser-
vations. BPs were also identiﬁed in the neighborhood of a jet by
Schmieder et al. (2013) close to a magnetic coronal null point.
In this particular example, the role of BPs in the jet expulsion
was unclear.

5.2.2. BPs in AR 10484

As mentioned in Sect. 1, numerical models explaining the ori-
gin of jets propose as a basis a magnetic conﬁguration above
which a magnetic null point and its fan separatix are present (see
e.g., Pariat et al. 2009a, 2015; Rachmeler et al. 2010, and the
review by Raouaﬁ et al. 2016). Then, we ﬁrst look for the pres-
ence of coronal magnetic null points at the location of the ﬂare
and jet on 23 October. We ﬁnd no magnetic null point at that
place or in other zone of the AR that could be associated with the
ﬂare and broad jet. However, we ﬁnd a set of two BPs that we
call BP1 and BP2. These can be seen in Fig. 10c together with
RHESSI high-energy HXR contours. Furthermore, as discussed
in Sect. 3, AR 10484 produced broad jets that erupted in narrow
or jet-like CMEs from 21 to 24 October. The recurrency of very
similar events at approximately the same location in the AR (see
Fig. 2) leads us to check if the same magnetic ﬁeld topology can
be found associated with this series of events. The diﬀerent pan-
els in Fig. 10 show the presence of BPs and the intersection with
the photosphere of their associated separatrices at approximately
the locations of the base of the jets and brightenings or ﬂares on
21, 22, and 23 October.

The magnetic ﬁeld model, which is the base for the BP com-
putations, is done on each day using as boundary condition the

corresponding MDI map and taking the same value of α, deter-
mined in Sect. 5.1. The extension and the shape of the BPs varies
as the magnetic ﬁeld evolved, mainly as the positive ﬁeld polari-
ties were cancelled. The BPs appear as separated in diﬀerent por-
tions. However, we infer that an elongated BP is present on 21
October, which ﬁnally evolves into the two portions we call BP1
and BP2 on 23 October. These two BPs are not deﬁning a com-
mon separator as described analytically by Bungey et al. (1996)
and found in an observed example by Mandrini et al. (2002).
In Fig. 10 the BPs are shown as the thickest green continuous
lines at the photospheric level, while the thick magenta contin-
uous lines correspond to the trace of the BP separatrices. The
ones mainly to the west of the positive polarities and within the
drawn box (see Fig. 10) lie on the photospheric plane. Those
to the east and at the border or out of the drawn box are shown
projected on the photosphere. As an example, Fig. 11a shows
a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines in blue color that trace the separa-
trices of BP1 and BP2. Those reaching the photosphere to the
west are low lying and closed, while the ones extending to the
east are large-scale and open (as discussed in Sect. 5.3), they
reach the separatices that appear projected on the photosphere
(see also Fig. 10c). These separatrix traces lie at the top of our
computational domain (see Fig. 11b).

It can be seen when comparing Fig. 10c with the Hα (Fig. 6)
and TRACE and RHESSI observations (Fig. 4) that the ﬂares
kernels and RHESSI high-energy contours are located, within
coalignment errors (see Berlicki et al. 2004, for a discussion on
coaligning RHESSI with other satellite instruments) and consid-
ering RHESSI’s spatial resolution, on the BP separatrices lying
at the photospheric level. On the other hand, the low-energy
RHESSI contours lie on BP1 and partially on BP2. Furthermore,
the magnetic ﬁeld lines extending to the east in Fig. 11a agree
well with the direction of the broad jet. This suggests that mag-
netic reconnection occurring at the BP separatrices could be at
the origin of the ﬂare and jet in AR 10484.

Fig. 12 represents a static view directly derived from
our coronal ﬁeld model that shows in a snapshot both pre-
reconnected and reconnected ﬁeld lines. We infer the direction
in which reconnection proceeds from the observed event evolu-
tion (see e.g. Mandrini et al. 2015, and references therein). In
Fig. 12a we draw in blue and red color a set of pre-reconnected
and reconnected ﬁeld lines, respectively. This panel is shown
in the observer’s point of view, while in Fig. 12b the same set
of ﬁeld lines is shown in a perspective that allows to distinguish
them clearly.
In this ﬁgure the closed blue ﬁeld lines are an-
chored at the photospheric level by line-tying, while the open
ones are anchored only at one end (at the other end they ex-
tend out of our computational domain). The closed blue lines
have been computed starting integration very close to the corre-
sponding BP on its western side, while the open ones are com-
puted from the BP eastern side. It is via magnetic reconnection
that the blue ﬁeld lines can evolve into the red ﬁeld lines with
very close footpoints but located on the other side of the photo-
spheric trace of each BP separatrix; the blue ﬁeld lines are line
tied at the photosphere by the gravity force acting on the dense
plasma at their bases. Several numerical models (see references
in Sect. 5.2.1) show that magnetic reconnection can occur in con-
ﬁgurations similar to the one we describe (see in particular the
sketch in Fig. 8 of Cheung et al. (2010) summarizing the evolu-
tion found in their simulation).

Our data analysis, combined with modeling and magnetic
ﬁeld topology computation, let us propose two possible scenar-
ios to explain this particular event. These scenarios share the

rope could produce the observed blowout jet as it accesses the
open reconnected ﬁeld lines. This evolution is somehow sim-
ilar to what happens in numerical simulations of jets having a
null point topology, as the ones discussed by Pariat et al. (2009b,
2015). In these simulations, the photospheric line-tied forcing
does not directly stress the fan surface but allows the accumula-
tion of energy in the conﬁguration below the fan, as we propose
it happens below the BP separatrix.

In the second scenario, we speculate that the continuous
twisting/shearing motions and ﬂux cancellation can build up
current layers at the BP separatices in a quasistatic way, un-
til impulsive reconnection occurs through a resistive instability
(Billinghurst et al. 1993; Pariat et al. 2009b). The process can
lead to fast energy release. As a result, we would observe the
impulsive M2.4 ﬂare and, if the reconnection region reaches the
open ﬁeld, the plasma in the open reconnected ﬁeld lines giving
the observed broad jet. After the event, the conﬁguration relaxes
and goes back to a low level energy state. However, recent 3D
MHD simulations by Baumann et al. (2013), in which the initial
topology contains a null point and the ﬁeld is stressed by pho-
tospheric shearing motions, show that the currents accumulated
mainly at the fan separatrix are not enough to give a ﬂare-like
energy release as the one needed to explain the observed M2.4
ﬂare. These authors propose that to produce a ﬂare additional
free energy should be contained in the initial non-potential state.
Therefore, by analogy with the conﬁguration in Baumann et al.
(2013), in our BP topology we consider that though this second
scenario could explain some minor brightenings and collimated
jets, it would not be suitable to explain the energetic ﬂare and
blowout jet we observe.

to the events we analyze in detail in this article. In panel (c) we have
labeled the BPs as BP1 and BP2 and overlaid the RHESSI contours
shown in Fig. 4d (light green contours correspond to the 50–100 keV
range and yellow ones to the 10–15 keV range). The three panels are
shown from the observer’s point of view. The inclination of the sides
of the boxes (deﬁned in the local frame) indicates that the AR was not
at CM. BPs are shown as the thickest green continuous lines, while the
magenta thick continuous lines correspond to the photospheric trace of
the BP separatrices. The contours correspond to ± 50 G, ± 100 G, and

same topology, but the way in which the event is triggered is
diﬀerent.

A ﬁrst possibility is that the sustained twisting/shearing mo-
tions and ﬂux cancellation can contribute to the continuous for-
mation of a ﬂux rope below the BP closed separatrix. The
photospheric evolution can accumulate energy in the constantly
formed ﬂux rope and contribute to its destabilization and erup-
tion (van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Aulanier et al. 2010).
As the ﬂux rope rises it can force reconnection between oppo-
sitely directed ﬁeld lines above the BPs leading to the formation
of a current layer and fast energy release. To illustrate this pro-
cess we have numbered two pre-reconnected ﬁeld lines as 1 and
2 in Fig. 12(b) and the resulting reconnected line as 3. The result
of this process is the impulsive M2.4 ﬂare with kernels located in
the close vicinity of the BP separatrices. Plasma in the erupting

connection can proceed (see Sect. 5.2.2). The height of these ﬁeld lines
has been multiplied by a factor of four so that they can be clearly dis-
tinguished. The conventions for the ﬁeld isocontours, axes, BPs, and
separatrices are the same as in Fig. 10

.

5.3. The global magnetic-ﬁeld model

Our local magnetic ﬁeld model of AR 10484 shows that ﬁeld
lines associated to the BPs extend to the east and end at the top
of our computation box. In order to examine what is the behav-
ior of those ﬁeld lines in the large scale, we use a global Po-
tential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. The model is com-
puted with the Finite Diﬀerence Iterative Potential-ﬁeld Solver
(FDIPS) code developed by Tóth et al. (2011), which provides
more accurate results at high-latitude regions than those typi-
cally obtained with spherical harmonic expansion methods (see
Mandrini et al. 2014, for details on the model). The source sur-
face is set at 2.5 RSun and the grid is spherical with 150 bins in
the radial direction, 180 latitudinal bins, and 360 longitudinal
bins. The photospheric boundary condition is prescribed by the
MDI (polar ﬁeld corrected) synoptic magnetogram for Carring-
ton rotation (CR) 2009.

The coronal magnetic ﬁeld is well described by PFSS mod-
els at global scales, except in regions where high currents are
present, such as could be the case around ﬁlaments. However,
for our purpose and considering its limitations, such a model
provides a reasonable description of the connectivity of the ﬁeld
around AR 10484. This is illustrated in Fig. 13, which shows
the result of the model when the AR was at the central meridian.
The displayed ﬁeld lines have been traced using a set of coronal
starting points separated by 10◦ (in both latitude and longitude)

convention is such that black indicates closed lines and pink (green)

polarity) ﬁeld.

and are located at a height of ≈ 350 Mm above the photosphere.
The selection provides a fairly uniform sampling of the large
scale structure around and above the AR. The magnetic ﬁeld
line passing each selected starting point is traced in both direc-
tions until the photosphere (1.0 RS un) or the source surface (2.5
RSun) is reached. Fig. 13a shows the global ﬁeld model, while
in Fig. 13b we have selected a set of ﬁeld lines anchored at AR
10484. From these ﬁgures it is clear that there is a set of open
ﬁeld lines that could serve as a channel for the plasma ejected in
the broad jet that we associate to the narrow eastern CME seen
later and depicted in Fig. 8.

6. Summary and conclusions

A series of recurrent jets were observed in the EUV with
SOHO/EIT, with a few seen in the UV with TRACE and in
Hα at ARIES in Nainital, India, from 21 to 24 October 2003.
The jet eruptions originated from similar locations in AR 10484.
This site was to the east of a major negative spot around which a
smaller negative spot rotated in the counter-clockwise direction
(see Fig. 2 in Sect. 4.1 and references therein) forcing the can-
cellation of small positive polarities located between the rotating
spots and to their east. The sustained rotation lasted for at least
48 hs. As a result, the magnetic ﬁeld at that location was con-
stantly twisted and sheared while negative magnetic helicity was
injected.

(a)(b)123(a) (b) The events started with brightenings of diﬀerent intensities
at their bases that were closely followed by the jet eruptions to-
wards the east. The observed jets are broader than standard colli-
mated jets and have diﬀerent lenghts, with a maximum projected
length of ≈ 220 Mm (see Table 1). For most of the jet events
listed in Table 1, we identify a coronal counterpart in LASCO
images. Only in three cases the association between the jets and
the LASCO CMEs is quantitatively established; those are the
two events studied in Yan et al. (2012) and the one discussed in
Sect. 4.4. The white-light events were all either narrow CMEs
or jet-like CMEs. As discussed in Vourlidas et al. (2013), these
type of CMEs may contain ﬁlamentary material. Even though
we cannot identify a ﬁlament or similar cold feature at the base
of the jets before the events, we consider that they belong to the
blowout class (Moore et al. 2010) when taking into account all
their observed characteristics. Furthermore, when looking at Ta-
ble 1 and comparing with the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in Fig. 2,
there seems to be more jets when ﬂux cancellation is more eﬃ-
cient than when the positive ﬂux has almost disappeared. This
means that both magnetic ﬁeld twisting and shearing, with the
consequent energy and helicity input into the conﬁguration, plus
cancellation play a key role in the observed events.

As mentioned above, all the blowout jets in Table 1 were
accompanied by brightenings at their bases. In three cases, the
energy built up in the conﬁguration by twisting and shearing of
the ﬁeld is enough to produce three impulsive M-class ﬂares.
The location and morphology of the main ﬂare brightenings is
similar for the three M ﬂares. Two of these ﬂares, an M1.4 and
an M1.2, occurred on 22 October with a diﬀerence of one hour
and were studied by Yan et al. (2012). The third ﬂare, the most
energetic of the three, is the one analyzed in this article (see
Sect. 4). The M2.4 ﬂare on 23 October started around 10 hours
after the second event on 22 October. This ﬂare is characterized
by the presence of HXR footpoints seen by RHESSI with a SXR
source in between. RHESSI kernels are cospatial with UV and
Hα kernels and lie at the base of the jet.

To understand the origin of the homologous blowout jets,
small brightenings and ﬂare kernels at their bases, we model the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld of AR 10484 and compute its topology.
Our models use MDI magnetograms as boundary conditions dur-
ing the days when the events were observed. We ﬁnd no mag-
netic null points either at the location of the events or at other
places in the AR that can be connected to the jets and brighten-
ings. However, we ﬁnd BPs in our magnetic ﬁeld models. The
location, elongation, and shape of the BPs on the photosphere
vary as the magnetic ﬁeld evolves (see Fig. 10), but they are
always at the place from where the jets erupted. Magnetic ﬁeld
lines calculated starting integration at the western side of the BPs
end at the separatrices on the photosphere, while those starting
from the BP eastern sides are very long lines that extend up to
the upper surfaces of our computation boxes an end at the sep-
aratrices located there (see Figs. 11 and 12 for the model on 23
October). These later ﬁeld lines, that open up towards the east
limb, are the ones through which the plasma from the jets gets
channeled, thus allowing for the observation of the white-light
counterparts at eastern equatorial PAs. This is conﬁrmed by a
PFSS model of CR 2009 that shows that ﬁeld lines anchored at
the eastern side of AR 10484, at approximately the jet bases,
reach the source surface at 2.5 RS un (see Fig. 13), i.e. they are
open ﬁeld lines.

Combining data analysis with modeling and magnetic ﬁeld
topology computation, we have proposed two possible scenar-
ios to explain the particular event on 23 October at 02:41 UT
(see Sect. 5.2.2). These can be also applied to the blowout jets

seen from 21 to 24 October 2003 and the brightenings of vary-
ing intensities at their bases (see Sect. 3), which share the same
magnetic topology. In the ﬁrst scenario, twisting/shearing mo-
tions and ﬂux cancellation can contribute to the continuous for-
mation of a ﬂux rope below the BP closed separatrix which can
eventually erupt and force reconnection between oppositely di-

energy released in the diﬀerent events depends on the amount
stored mainly in the ﬂux rope. Events will occur for as long as
both, shearing/twisting motions and ﬂux cancellation, continue.
Observations of coronal jets driven by the eruptions of small-
scale ﬁlaments support this ﬁrst proposed scenario (Raouaﬁ et al.
2012; Kayshap et al. 2013; Sterling et al. 2015). In the second
scenario, we speculate that current layers can form at the BP sep-
aratices, by the continuous twisting/shearing motions and ﬂux
cancellation, in a quasistatic way until impulsive reconnection
occurs through a resistive instability. The conﬁguration relaxes
to a lower energy state after each event. This process can be re-
peated for as long as the forcing continues. The energy released
in the diﬀerent events would depend on the amount stored be-
tween event and event. However, the results of 3D MHD sim-
ulations by Baumann et al. (2013) show that the currents accu-
mulated (mainly at the fan separatrix in their numerical models)
are not enough to produce a ﬂare-like energy release. There-
fore, though this scenario could explain the minor brightenings
observed from 21 to 24 October, it would not be suitable to ex-
plain the blowout jets and energetic ﬂares on 22 and 23 October
in AR10484. From this perspective, the ﬁrst scenario seems the
most plausible one.

To compare ejective aspects during two solar rotations of two
distinct solar minima, Cremades et al. (2011) used a broad crite-
rion to consider all kinds of white-light coronal ejecta, from thin
collimated jets to bright and wide CMEs, going through narrow
and faint ejecta. The results discussed in this article support the
idea that a continuum of events may exist between standard col-
limated jets and CMEs. Furthermore, our study is the ﬁrst clear
conﬁrmation that magnetic topologies containing BPs can also
produce jets leading the ejected plasma into the open ﬁeld. In
our view, these results should motivate the development of jet
models including broader topologies than the classical one based
on the presence of magnetic null points.
