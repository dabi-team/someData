Merging real and virtual worlds: An analysis of the state of
the art and practical evaluation of Microsoft Hololens

by Adrien COPPENS

Achieving a symbiotic blending between reality and virtuality is a dream
that has been lying in the minds of many people for a long time. Advances
in various domains constantly bring us closer to making that dream come
true. Augmented reality as well as virtual reality are in fact trending terms
and are expected to further progress in the years to come.

This master’s thesis aims to explore these areas and starts by deﬁning
necessary terms such as augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). Usual
taxonomies to classify and compare the corresponding experiences are then
discussed.

In order to enable those applications, many technical challenges need to
be tackled, such as accurate motion tracking with 6 degrees of freedom (po-
sitional and rotational), that is necessary for compelling experiences and to
prevent user sickness. Additionally, augmented reality experiences typically
rely on image processing to position the superimposed content. To do so,
“paper” markers or features extracted from the environment are often em-
ployed. Both sets of techniques are explored and common solutions and al-
gorithms are presented.

After investigating those technical aspects, I carry out an objective com-
parison of the existing state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in those do-
mains, and I discuss present and potential applications in these areas. As a
practical validation, I present the results of an application that I have devel-
oped using Microsoft HoloLens, one of the more advanced affordable tech-
nologies for augmented reality that is available today. Based on the experi-
ence and lessons learned during this development, I discuss the limitations
of current technologies and present some avenues of future research.

Keywords: augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, Microsoft Hololens,
human-computer interaction, computer vision

Chapter 1

Introduction

Merging real and virtual worlds has been in many people’s minds for decades
but, as the hardware evolved (in terms of computing power and display qual-
ity) and because of advances in computer vision, such experiences are more
believable every day.

While science ﬁction cinematographic works have helped us envision
what the future could be, with futuristic virtual interfaces in movies such as
Minority Report (2002) and Iron Man (2008), the aforementioned improve-
ments make them realistic.

The huge success of Pokémon Go1 as well as ﬁnancial forecasts [35, 121]
make us believe in the potential of augmented and virtual reality in many
domains of human endeavor. The exact meaning of those terms will be
explained in chapter 2 and potential applications will be discussed in later
chapters.

This master’s thesis will ﬁrst deﬁne, classify and compare categories of
reality/virtuality experiences. Then, chapter 3 will discuss several of those
with regards to the techniques and technologies that are required to enable
the corresponding experiences. Each classiﬁcation will be illustrated with
concrete applications (in chapters 4 and 5). Chapter 6 will then present a
project created as part of this master’s thesis and that runs on Microsoft
Hololens.

Finally, based on the experience acquired and the state of the art, chapter
7 will dicuss current limitations as well as future prospects and research in
those areas.

Chapter 2

Deﬁnitions and taxonomy

Lots of papers, studies, blog articles and other resources can be found about
different ways of merging reality and virtuality. Most people have heard
about several terms such as augmented reality and virtual reality but what
do they really mean? How do they compare/differ? This ﬁrst chapter will
deﬁne those terms and discuss taxonomies to understand how they relate.

2.1 Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented Reality (which will from now on be referred to as AR) describes
the blending of the real world with a virtual one. It can basically be seen
as "adding virtual things on top of the real world’s perception". A typical
example of an AR device is Google Glass [58] whereas the game Pokémon
Go [111] helped popularize AR with its integration of Pokémon on top of the
live camera feed as if they were there in the real world (as shown on ﬁgure
2.1).

FIGURE 2.1: AR feature in Pokémon Go1

In order to enable AR experiences, different kinds of displays can be used.
The following sections will introduce a few of those categories and provide
concrete examples.

Monitor-based AR displays

This is the simplest type of AR displays available. It refers to non-immersive
experiences where the augmentation happens on a "distant" screen, such as
a TV or a smartphone (even though in that particular case, the more spe-
ciﬁc "handheld AR" is often used). The display is treated as a window to
the augmented world (hence the alternative name "Window-on-the-World"
given by Milgram et al. [104]) created from live or stored video images. Due
to its accessibility (from the user’s point of view) it is the most prominent
form of AR experiences, with lots of applications in sports broadcasting (ex-
amples shown in ﬁgures 2.2a and 2.2b). The previously mentioned feature
in Pokémon Go also is an example of monitor-based AR as it takes place on
smartphone screens.

See-through AR displays

A second class of displays used for AR experiences allows the user to see the
augmented world "directly" in the sense that he sees the real world from his
own perspective (as opposed to monitor-based displays that show images
from a "distant" camera). Figure 2.3 pictures some possibilities to make the
augmentation happen and highlight differences in where the observer is lo-
cated in relation to the real object as well as what type of image is generated
(i.e. planar or curved).

Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are often linked to Virtual Reality but
are also extensively used in AR. In the context of a video see-through HMD,
the user sees the real world through a camera system attached to the de-
vice that aims to reproduce the effective viewpoint of the user’s eyes. It is
also possible to project virtual elements on a transparent surface in front of
the observer. In that case, the display is referred to as optical see-through.
Depending on where that surface is located in relation to the user, different
names are given: spatial see-through display if it is separated from the user’s

head; or simply optical see-through HMD if it is attached to it. A current ex-
ample of a device falling into the latter category is Microsoft Hololens. Even
though that device will be further discussed in chapter 6, ﬁgure 2.4 shows
the idea behind it: anchoring holograms into the real world.

FIGURE 2.4: Microsoft Hololens use case: Designing operating
rooms with holograms integrated into the real world4

It is worth mentioning that different issues arise depending on the type
of see-through being used, as pointed out by Fuchs and Ackerman [46]. An
optical see-through HMD will provide an unmatched direct view of the real
world but will require more advanced technologies (e.g.
to accommodate
changes in head position/orientation rapidly enough, to deal with light in-
tensity and to properly handle occlusion). On the other hand, a video see-
through HMD will have to make sure the ﬁeld of view (FOV, the extent of
the scene that can be seen, generally measured in degrees) is acceptable and,

more importantly, that the video itself has a high and stable framerate. In-
deed, whereas a video see-through display can make sure the real world and
its augmentations are synchronized, it might introduce a delay between the
movements of the user’s head and what he sees. This has to be handled
with caution as, otherwise, users might suffer from nausea. Another element
worth pointing out is the perhaps surprising "age" of see-through displays.
In fact, it appears that HMD systems were developed as early as in the late
1960s, by Sutherland [155] and, at the same time, by Furness [49] for the US
Air Force with projects that then lead to the "Super Cockpit" program [50,
157] in 1986.

The last kinds of see-through displays that will be discussed here are reti-
nal displays (sometimes named RPDs for Retinal Projection Displays, RSDs
for Retinal Scanning Displays or even VRDs for Virtual Retinal Displays). As
shown on the top-left corner of ﬁgure 2.3, it is possible to generate AR images
closer to the eye. In fact, retinal displays are drawing those images directly
onto the eye’s retina using low-power laser beams. While the principle could
frighten readers at ﬁrst glance, it should be mentioned that the eyes of the
wearer remain safe, even after being exposed for several hours [74]. Even
better, the technology doesn’t tire the eyes as much as a conventional HMD
[94]. Several prototypes (e.g. by Schowengerdt et al. from the University
of Washington [144]) and even actual products (e.g. Laser EyeWear (LEW)
[74] from Fujitsu, QD Laser and the University of Tokyo) exist but are not
available as of yet. Despite the fact that it is not directly related to AR, it is
interesting to note that such a technology can also be used to help people
with low vision that "standard" glasses cannot correct [37].

Spatial AR

Sometimes referred to as projection or projective AR, spatial AR (SAR) is
about augmenting reality by projecting images directly onto real objects. Al-
though ﬁgure 2.3 already mentioned "spatial" and "projector", SAR did not
really belong in the see-through category as there is no actual display other
than the real world objects themselves. First introduced by Raskar et al. [122],
SAR can therefore "naturally" provide multi-user experiences. As of now,
most applications of those techniques are related to a cultural context where
images are projected onto surfaces such as the facade of a building. Some-
times referred to as monumental projections [72] and video or 3D mapping,
those techniques can also provide 360°experiences [107] as well as user’s in-
teraction [69].

Other types of AR

So far only visual AR categories have been presented. It should however be
mentioned that other kinds of AR exist that are using different senses: audio,
haptic, olfactory and gustatory AR. Haptic (touch) interfaces will brieﬂy be
discussed in chapter 7 but audio, olfactory and gustatory AR go beyond the
scope of this work.

2.2 Augmented Virtuality (AV)

While AR was about augmenting the real world with virtual objects, aug-
mented virtuality (AV) is about adding real world elements into a virtual
world. Most AV applications can be subsumed as "chroma key experiences".
Examples include weather forecast broadcasts and video conferences into
virtual environments [125] (as shown in ﬁgure 2.5). Even closer to virtual
reality (discussed in section 2.3), applications where the user’s hands are in-
tegrated into a virtual world (e.g. a "virtual studio for architectural explo-
ration" by Bruder et al. [19]) are also examples of AV.

FIGURE 2.5:

cAR/PE!: AV videoconferencing system by Re-

genbrecht et al. [125]

As of now, AV is nowhere near as popular as AR or VR. In fact, it is highly
unlikely that this situation will change in the future for two reasons. Firstly,
because the boundaries between those categories can be "blurred" and people
will naturally use terms they know. Secondly, because technologies will keep
on improving and it will become harder and harder to distinguish what is
physically real from what was virtually added.

2.3 Virtual Reality (VR)

Virtual Reality (VR) describes experiences where the user is entirely immersed
into a three-dimensional virtual world and interacts with it. While the pater-
nity of the concept is unclear, VR as a term is generally attributed to Lanier
who worked actively [31, 87] in the domain in the late 1980’s. The usual
equipment used for VR experiences involves a HMD and some kind of con-
troller (in early products from Lanier: a glove). Figure 2.6 shows one of the
ﬁrst VR commercial products by VPL Research (Lanier’s company) in 1989.

FIGURE 2.6: The EyePhone: one of the very ﬁrst VR HMDs
available for purchase5

It should however be mentioned that VR is not limited to HMDs. In the
early 1990’s, Cruz-Neira et al. at the University of Illinois developed CAVE
(Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) [33], a VR setup in a cubic room, with
images projected on the walls. This alternative to HMDs provides great im-
mersive experiences with a wide ﬁeld-of-view (see ﬁgure 2.7) but requires
extra room and isn’t as affordable.

FIGURE 2.7: A recent setup of a CAVE-like setup at Teesside
University6

2.4 The Reality-Virtuality continuum

Now that some terms have been deﬁned, it is time to introduce the most
frequently used taxonomy: the Reality Virtuality continuum by Milgram et
al. [105]. In 1994, AR was already a popular term in the literature but different
deﬁnitions where given. Therefore, Milgram et al. wanted to clarify what
that term meant and how it related to VR. In order to do so, they created a
continuum (shown in ﬁgure 2.8) that is still considered as the main reference
to classify experiences mixing real and virtual elements.

2.4. The Reality-Virtuality continuum

9

FIGURE 2.8: The original RV continuum by Milgram et al. [105]

The idea behind this one-dimensional taxonomy is that there is a broad
range of applications between an entirely real world and a solely virtual en-
vironment. They can be placed on that axis depending on whether they are
primarily using reality or the virtual world.

In that ﬁgure, the term Mixed Reality (MR) is introduced but we (pur-
posely) did not deﬁne it yet. In fact, it has been misused in recent years to
describe "spatial aware" AR devices and experiences (further discussion on
that in chapter 6). Milgram et al. deﬁnes a MR environment as “one in which
real world and virtual world objects are presented together within a single
display, that is, anywhere between the extrema of the RV continuum”. There-
fore, MR is a subset containing AR, AV and even VR experiences as they are
not entirely virtual because section 2.3 stated that, in order to be considered
as a VR experience, an application needs to include user interactions.

In his PhD thesis about spatial AR, Ridel [129] proposed an extended ver-
sion of Milgram et al.’s RV continuum to differentiate SAR from see-through
AR. As SAR directly projects the images on a real world surface, he chose to
put it further the left. Figure 2.9 shows that version of the continuum.

FIGURE 2.9: The extended RV continuum by Ridel [129]

In order to clarify where VR experiences should be placed on that contin-
uum, we slightly modiﬁed Ridel’s version. The resulting further extended
RV continuum is shown in ﬁgure 2.10.

Even though some terms mentioned previously are not included in it (e.g.
we could also differentiate between different kinds of see-through AR), we
believe this version is sufﬁciently complete to clarify everything that has been
mentioned so far.

including VR

2.5 Other taxonomies

As a one-dimensional continuum is not sufﬁcient to highlight the differences
between a plethora of mixed reality experiences, other taxonomies are needed.
In fact, in the same paper [104], Milgram et al. summarize the main points of
a three-dimensional taxonomy for mixed reality systems, that is further dis-
cussed in another paper [103]. The paper describes 3 axes: Extent of World
Knowledge (EWK: how much do we know about the - real or virtual - world
in which the experience happens?), Reproduction Fidelity (RF: is the aug-
mented content realistic?) and Extent of Presence Metaphor (EPM: is the
user immersed in the experience or does he look at a monitor?). The result-
ing three-dimensional "hyperspace" is depicted in ﬁgure 2.11.

FIGURE 2.11: Milgram et al.’s three-dimensional taxonomy for
classifying mixed reality displays [104]

Another classiﬁcation worth mentioning is Fuchs’ VR taxonomy [48] based
on what he describes as its inherent functions: the ability for the user to pull
himself out of his own real environment (1) and/or his present time (2) in
order to interact (3) in a virtual world.

(1) leads to states where the user is:






L→ in a distant or non-human scale environment
L∪
L0

in a virtual world with other users
in the same place or the location is irrelevant to the application

2.5. Other taxonomies

11

(2) leads to states where the user is:

(3) leads to states where the user is:






in present time

T0
T− in the past
T+ in the future






IAr
IAi
IA0

in a world that simulates reality
in an imaginary/symbolic world
in the real world

Experiences can then be classiﬁed by combining those characteristics (14
resulting categories because multiple users (L∪) can only interact in the present
moment (L0)). Virtual tours are therefore in (IAr, T0, L→) and a VR sci-ﬁ game
would be in (IAi, T+, (L0 + L→)), with the + sign meaning "and/or".

Many other taxonomies have been proposed. A few more examples are
classiﬁcations based on what is being augmented [99, 66] (user, objects or en-
vironment), by purpose [38], or based on whether the action is determined
by the system or the user [127]. However, Milgram et al.’s RV continuum
remains the standard reference in the domain and will therefore be used
throughout this thesis.

Chapter 3

Motion tracking and related
computer vision techniques

VR and AR have shared requirements in terms of motion and positional
tracking, common techniques to meet those needs will therefore be presented.
Additionally, AR applications often have to recognize landmarks in the en-
vironment and get a sense of the user’s surroundings, the corresponding
problems and speciﬁc computer vision techniques to tackle them will also
be discussed in this chapter.

3.1 Motion tracking

In order to enable compelling VR applications, a way to track the user’s head
(and optionally some kind of controller) is needed. This section will present
a few techniques that can be used for that matter but ﬁrst, let us clarify what
we need exactly.

We want to be able to track movements in 3D space, which means we
need to know the tracked object’s position as well as its rotation. That kind of
tracking is usually labeled as 6 DoF (degrees of freedom) because the object
effectively has 6 separate ways to modify its position (3 axes: x, y, z) and
rotations (yaw, pitch, roll) as seen in ﬁgure 3.1, where each color represents
one of those degrees of freedom.

FIGURE 3.1: 6 degrees of freedom (DoF)1

14

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

An ideal tracking system would need to meet the following characteris-

tics:

• High accuracy: user motions should be accurately tracked

• High precision:

jitter should be negligible and imperceptible by the
user, no movement should be registered when the tracking target is not
moving

• Low latency and high update rate: the delay between a motion and the
system’s awareness of that motion should be very low as failing to do
so leads to user sickness

• Wide range: users should not be restricted to a small area of interaction

around the sensor(s)

• High mobility: users should be able to move freely (wireless and au-
tonomous trackers are therefore preferred) in their environment which
also implies the tracking system has to be as small and light as possible

• Environmental robustness: disruptive elements from the environment
sunlight, temperature or magnetic ﬁelds) should not alter the

(e.g.
tracking system’s quality

3.1.1 Mechanical tracking

Mechanical tracking probably is simpler than other methods, at least con-
ceptually. In fact, the tracked object is typically directly linked to the system
via several mechanical "arms" (made up of articulated pieces). The object’s
position and rotation is then determined using the angles of the arms’ joints
(with sensors placed on those joints). The same principle (calculating the
angles of speciﬁc joints) has also been used for full body tracking with com-
plete suits (that are very expensive but typically wireless) such as Inition’s
MotionShadow2 pictured in ﬁgure 3.2.

The issue with that solution therefore is either the cost (for body suits)
or the restricted movements provided by mechanical structures the user is
attached to.

3.1.2 Magnetic tracking

Magnetic tracking uses a base station that generates current and therefore
a magnetic ﬁeld. Sensors are placed on the tracked device and are able to
measure the magnitude of that magnetic ﬁeld (it varies depending on the
distance) as well as its direction (an example of a magnetic ﬁeld can be seen
in ﬁgure 3.3).

3.1. Motion tracking

15

FIGURE 3.2: MotionShadow, a full body tracking system3

Using that data, both the position and the rotation of the device can be
determined. Example of commercial products using that technology include
Razer Hydra controllers4 (now classiﬁed as "legacy") and Polhemus trackers5.

FIGURE 3.3: Example of magnetic ﬁeld lines6

That solution means that the base station does not need to be in sight
(with regards to the sensors) but other devices (electrical appliances, com-
puters, etc) can cause disturbances.

3.1.3 Acoustic tracking

Another possibility to track those 6 DoF uses ultrasonic (> 20000 Hz) signals
emitted by several sources. Receivers are placed on the tracked object and

16

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

Time of Flight (ToF) measurements determine the distance from the emitter
to each receiver. As the sensors’ geometry on the tracked object is known, the
position and rotation can be computed. Even though it isn’t the most popu-
lar method in VR, a few commercial products exist such as some InterSense
trackers7.

That solution is cheap but isn’t very resistant to environmental interfer-

ence (e.g. pressure or temperature changes)

3.1.4

Inertial tracking

Using accelerometers and gyroscopes (inertial sensors as they are based on
the principle of inertia i.e. F = ma = m dv
dt ), one can also get a 6-DoF track-
ing solution. An accelerometer measures the difference between the object’s
acceleration projected on the sensitive axis and gravity (9.81 m/s² upwards),
thus enabling one-dimensional position tracking, whereas gyroscopes mea-
sures rotation around a single axis. Resulting measurements (from 3 ac-
celerometers and 3 gyroscopes) can then be used to provide both the posi-
tion and the rotation of an object, in what is generally called an IMU (inertial
measurement unit).

That solution is very widely available as smartphones contain those sen-
sors, most people therefore have a 6 DoF tracking system in their pocket (al-
though only rotation data is relatively reliable, because of the drifting prob-
lem described below). Other products using those principles include Nin-
tendo’s Wiimote (that also uses optical tracking, discussed in section 3.1.5)
pictured in ﬁgure 3.4 as well as Microsoft Hololens (see section 6.1).

FIGURE 3.4: Nintendo’s controller, the Wiimote8

The biggest advantage of using inertial tracking is that it doesn’t require
any base station or emitter but one should note that it also is immune to

environmental interference. However, they are either very expensive (com-
pared to other solutions) or less accurate. They are often coupled with an-
other method because accelerometers cannot be used for long-term tracking
on their own (as demonstrated in [83]). They in fact drift and because ac-
celerometers measure acceleration, from which a relative position is derived,
offset errors are accumulated quadratically.

3.1.5 Optical tracking

Optical solutions are probably the most diverse and widely used tracking
systems. The general principle is that some kind of sensor (typically some
kind of camera) will either track features/patterns in the environment or ac-
tive/passive markers and use them to determine the object’s position and ro-
tation. The camera(s) can either be "external" to the tracked object (outside-in
tracking) or attached to it (inside-out tracking).

Active and passive markers

Solutions using active markers rely on light-emitting sources such as LEDs or
simple light bulbs that are placed on the tracked object. Those lights are often
invisible to humans (infrared lights that are only visible to infrared sensors)
but need a power source. Depending on how and what one needs to track,
the need for batteries can be an issue.

FIGURE 3.5: Active markers on the Oculus Rift DK29

Passive markers are not luminescent themselves but often reﬂect light
emitted by a source. The light emitted and its reﬂection typically are invisi-
ble to the human eye as well. "Paper" markers can be used as well and are
classiﬁed as passive markers.

As previously mentioned, it is also possible to dispose of markers entirely

e.g. using features from the environment or a projected pattern.

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

Invisible light

Using light sources typically leads to better results but it is generally desir-
able not to distract the user with them. Infrared lights are "too red" for the
human eye to see them and are therefore often used as "invisible" lights. It
should however be mentioned that using several infrared sensors can be a
problem (e.g. overlapping projected patterns confusing the sensors) and that
there still are drawbacks (e.g. sunlight interferences and issues with certain
types of surfaces). A few examples of techniques using infrared lights are
given below.

The ﬁrst version of Microsoft’s Kinect camera uses a technique called
"structured light", which essentially projects infrared patterns to get depth in-
formation. With that data, it can compute a 3D representation of the scene it
sees. Figure 3.6 shows the principle behind the method: the projected pattern
will be distorted according to its distance from the source. A more detailed
explanation using animations can be found in [158].

FIGURE 3.6: The structured light principle used in Kinect v110

Released in late 2013, the second generation, “Kinect for Xbox One” also
known as Kinect v2, employs a lightly different technology to get depth data:
the time of ﬂight (ToF) measurements we talked about in section 3.1.3. The
light emitted by the sensor is reﬂected on many kinds of surfaces and the
time it takes to return to the sensor is measured. As light speed is a well
known and constant value, the distance from the sensor can be computed.
The principle is shown in ﬁgure 3.7, where one can see that time is in fact
measured using phase shifts.

Another popular example of an optical tracking system is Valve’s Light-
house with its base station(s), often paired with HTC Vive’s headset and con-
trollers. A high-level view of how the optical tracking works can be found in
[164] and Kreylos’s article [82] provides a lot more details as well as precision
and accuracy evaluations.

Each base station uses two lasers to project lines of light (one laser hor-
izontally; the other one vertically, with regards to the station’s coordinate
system). As only one laser can emit light at any time, the base stations are

synchronized using ﬂashing LEDs. The same ﬂashing LEDs are used to syn-
chronize tracked devices.

The idea (pictured in ﬁgure 3.8) is that when it receives a synchroniza-
tion pulse, a receptor starts counting. When a laser beam hits a sensor, the
counting stops and the object’s position is updated (on a single axis as lines of
lights are either horizontal or vertical). In between those "optical updates", an
IMU is used to estimate the object’s position (one of Lighthouse’s purposes
is therefore to correct the IMU’s inevitable drifting).

FIGURE 3.8: Valve’s Lighthouse illustrated with an HTC Vive
headset and controllers12

3.1.6 Hybrid solutions

As Welch and Foxlin imply in their paper’s title (“Motion tracking: no sil-
ver bullet, but a respectable arsenal” [160]) and as seen in previous sections,
every method has its drawbacks. For that reason, lots of trackers are com-
bining different technologies in hybrid solutions. The term "sensor fusion" is
often coined to refer to combining sensory data. In order to blend that data,
several algorithms can come to help. A very frequent choice is Kalman ﬁlter-
ing (originally described in 1960 [76]) that relies on a mathematical model to
ﬁlter signals with an acceptable amount of statistical noise and inaccuracies.

20

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

One should be aware that, sometimes, hybrid trackers are described as
n-DoF solutions, with n > 6. As there only exist 6 degrees of freedom for
rigid bodies, this is simply a marketing trick to indicate that different sen-
sors are tracking the same degrees of freedom. For example, IMUs are fre-
quently equipped with magnetometers in addition to the accelerometers and
gyroscopes. Those magnetometers can be used as compasses to "reset" gyro-
scopes’ drift. As each type of sensor (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope
and 3-axis magnetometer) measures 3 degrees of freedom, the device is oc-
casionally labeled as a 9-DoF tracking system (when in fact gyroscopes and
magnetometers are measuring the same degrees of freedom).

3.2 Vision-based tracking

The set of techniques discussed in section 3.1 and their combination are sufﬁ-
cient for VR and motion capture. However, AR applications typically rely on
image processing and often use "paper" markers (they can be used for motion
tracking but other techniques are generally preferred) or features detected in
the environment. While vision-based tracking is a form of optical tracking
and could therefore be placed in section 3.1.5, the variety of techniques in
use and their predominance in AR deserve a speciﬁc section.

3.2.1 Template markers

Traditional vision-based tracking uses template markers, generally square
patterns as they are believed to be the best choice to position augmented con-
tent, with regards to the criteria chosen in [115] by Owen, Xiao, and Middlin.
A few examples of well-known square markers are shown in ﬁgure 3.9.

FIGURE 3.9: Some well-known square patterns [77]

ARToolkit13 probably is the most popular open-source AR tool. Figure

3.10 helps explaining how the system works.

It ﬁrst searches for black square shapes. Once one has been found, its
inner content is analyzed.
If that embedded content matches an expected
pattern (the exact marker has thus been identiﬁed), the corresponding con-
tent is superimposed on it (with proper scale, position and orientation by
using the marker’s corners).

FIGURE 3.10: ARToolkit’s work-ﬂow to superimpose aug-
mented content on traditional template square markers14

Different kinds of markers have been utilized with interesting properties
for some use cases. For example, a QR Code can easily be identiﬁed and
contains encoded data, which means resulting AR applications could read
the code to get a URL pointing to a remote model to be downloaded (and
then superimposed on the video feed). This approach has been discussed
and tested in [77].

Circular markers have also been explored and [29] in fact describes a long-
range solution using target-like markers, whose components are shown in
ﬁgure 3.11.

FIGURE 3.11: Circular markers proposed by Christen et al. [29]

3.2.2 Natural features

Image feature detectors and descriptors can be used in a wide range of appli-
cations, such as image classiﬁcation or object recognition, but are an essential

22

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

part of many AR applications. They also are vital for solving the simultane-
ous localization and mapping problem that will be discussed in section 3.3.

Depending on the speciﬁc task, different feature detectors and descrip-
tors can be appropriate, this section will discuss some of the most popular
methods.

Feature detectors

Feature detectors aim to ﬁnd interesting key points in an image. Those lo-
cal features should be invariant to position, rotation and scale changes. They
should also be robust to occlusion, noise, illumination change and sufﬁciently
distinct from each other.

Feature detectors are generally classiﬁed into 3 categories: single-scale

detectors, multi-scale detectors and afﬁne-invariant detectors [60].

Single-scale detectors
The ﬁrst group, single-scale detectors, can deal with positional and rotational
changes of the image. They can also handle noise and illumination changes
but they are not designed to cope with scaling issues. They can therefore be
helpful for "standard" AR applications that simply need a marker but cannot
be used when the same scene has to be recognized from different viewpoints
that cause scaling changes.

A typical example is Harris detector [59] that detects corners and edges
by looking at image gradients (that measure changes in the image’s intensity
or color). The general intuition behind it is pictured in ﬁgure 3.12.

FIGURE 3.12: Interesting points in an image: effect of translat-
ing a windows [152]

From the source image, a value that depends on the gradient is assigned
to each pixel (results are displayed in the second picture of ﬁgure 3.13, where
high values are shown in red). Using a threshold, only interesting points are
kept (the white dots from the third picture of the same ﬁgure). Finally, only
local maxima are kept (the highest values from the "local neighborhood"),
those are the key points returned as output, as shown on another example in
ﬁgure 3.14.

FIGURE 3.13: The workﬂow of Harris feature detector [152]

FIGURE 3.14: Output of Harris detector on an image, with red
dots representing detected features15

Other methods and adapted versions of the same general idea have been
proposed, such as SUSAN [154] that detects corners with lower-level pro-
cessing (using a circular mask centered on each pixel of the image to then
compare that center pixel’s intensity to the rest of the circular area). FAST
(Features from Accelerated Segment Test) [133, 134] is a well-known corner
detector, that also looks for features by using a circle around a candidate
point. This time though, the point p is considered a valid feature if a set
of contiguous pixels on the circle are brighter than the candidate (see ﬁgure
3.15). To enhance performance, some invalid points can be quickly ﬁltered
by only checking a few of those points, e.g. 1, 5, 9 and 13 on the same ﬁgure.

FIGURE 3.15: A candidate pixel p and the corresponding circle
around it using FAST [134]

24

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

Multi-scale detectors
Harris detector can easily be adapted to deal with scale changes if the exact
deformation is known. Unfortunately, in real world scenarios, scale change
is unknown and we need to ﬁnd ways to detect interesting points at varying
scales.

By identifying regions of the image that have properties (e.g. brightness
or color) that are different from their surroundings, we form blobs. To ﬁnd
them, a ﬁrst way is to use Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) ﬁlters that start by
smoothing the image with a Gaussian ﬁlter (essentially blurring it) then use a
Laplacian ﬁlter (very noise sensitive, hence the prior smoothing operation) to
get those blobs. LoG can therefore be applied for ﬁnding a location-speciﬁc
scale for a region of an image, which means it is possible to automatically
select the right scale for that region. Lindeberg proposed a multi-scale ap-
proach that does exactly that [95].

As LoG is computationally expensive, Lowe proposed a more efﬁcient so-
lution that is based on a difference of gaussians (DoG) at different scales [97].
The input image is successively smoother by a Gaussian ﬁlter and resam-
pled. LoG is then essentially approximated by subtracting two successive
smoothed images.

Afﬁne-invariant detectors

Single-scale detectors discussed previously exhibit invariance to transla-
tions and rotations. For their part, multi-scale detectors can also handle uni-
form scaling and, to some extent, afﬁne invariance (ability to handle shear
mapping and non-uniform scaling in addition to previous operations; with
shear essentially referring to the possibility of viewing the scene from a dif-
ferent perspective while preserving parallelism, as seen on ﬁgure 3.16).

FIGURE 3.16: Shear mapping and its preservation of paral-
lelism (and therefore perpendicularity)16

Afﬁne-invariant detectors go one step further: they are able to handle sig-
niﬁcant afﬁne transformations. Several existing feature detectors have been
extended to handle those perspective issues and methods have been devel-
oped, such as the one by Mikolajczyk and Schmid [102], proposed in 2004.

3.2. Vision-based tracking

The idea of that method is to extract the characteristic shape (as opposed to
the characteristic scale discussed before) of the detected feature. The circles
are in fact replaced by ellipses with axis lengths that depend on the same
gradient-dependent value used in Harris detector [59] we discussed before.

FIGURE 3.17: Mikolajczyk and Schmid’s proposal key concept:
characteristic shape, with ellipses of different sizes [101]

Feature descriptors

Now that feature detectors have been introduced, meaning key points can
be detected, it is time to "describe" them so that they can be recognized (and
matched). For that purpose, feature descriptors (sometimes referred to as
feature extractors), are used. They work by analyzing the feature’s surround-
ings (the pixels around it) and often use techniques described in the previous
section.

In 2004, Lowe presented SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) [98], a

detector and descriptor that uses 4 major steps:

• Scale-space extrema detection: use DoG to detect interesting points

• Keypoint localization: Determine location and scale, then select key-

points based on their stability

• Orientation assignment: Using gradient directions, assign orientations
to the keypoints (this step ensures the method is invariant to orienta-
tion, scale and location)

• Keypoint descriptor: Measure gradients in the region around each key-
point, transform them so that they are more robust to distortion and
illumination changes, then store them

In 2006, Bay, Tuytelaars, and Van Gool presented SURF (Speeded Up Ro-

bust Features) [9], designed as a more efﬁcient version of SIFT.

SIFT and SURF are both patented and use gradients (relatively computationally-

expensive and heavy on storage) as descriptors. For these reasons, binary
image descriptors have been developed with low power mobile devices in
mind. They essentially replace gradient-based encoding by a compact binary
string. A few examples of algorithms using them are given below.

Chapter 3. Motion tracking and related computer vision techniques

BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) [24] was intro-
duced in 2010 by Calonder et al. and is the ﬁrst technique that uses binary
descriptors. The idea is that, within the local region of a feature, pixels are
compared by pairs (chosen using different methods). Depending on how
their intensity relates, a binary value is assigned and by concatenating those
bits, we get the binary string used as descriptor.

Other well-known examples of binary image descriptors (therefore based
on Calonder et al.’s work) include BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable
Keypoints) [91], ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) [137] and FREAK
(Fast Retina Keypoints) [2].

A lot of comparisons between the aforementioned algorithms and their
combination (i.e. one of them used for feature detection, another for feature
description) have been published. Some are meant to compare these algo-
rithms based on their application to 3D object matching [108], pedestrian
detection [141] or visual tracking [56] (particularly useful for AR and SLAM,
that will be discussed in section 3.3). Other focus their analysis on binary
descriptors [62] or speciﬁc evaluation criteria, such as repeatability rate (how
stable the features are under different transformations) and information con-
tent (how features differ) [143].

Feature matching

Once features have been found and described, the next task is to match them
in different images. Various possibilities are being used for that purpose, re-
lying on nearest-neighbor approaches or randomized kd-tree forests like the
"fast library for approximate nearest neighbors" (FLANN) [109]. However,
those methods are not suitable for binary descriptors, which are typically
compared using the Hamming distance (essentially counting the number of
mismatching bits between the binary strings a and b, that show as 1’s after
computing a ⊕ b (XOR operation)).

3.3 SLAM

The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem describes the
mapping of an unknown environment by a mobile robot. Without any previ-
ous knowledge of its surroundings, the robot therefore has two problems to
solve at once: localize itself and map the environment.

SLAM is heavily tied with AR, especially spatial-aware AR, as devices
need to get a sense of their environment to successfully integrate the aug-
mented content in their surroundings. This section therefore introduces the
basics of the problem.

Even though several researchers were already working on mapping and
localization at the time, the structure of the SLAM problem and the coining
of the acronym was ﬁrst presented in [40] by Durrant-Whyte, Rye, and Nebot
in 1996.

In [39], Durrant-Whyte and Bailey give a formal deﬁnition of that prob-
lem as pictured in ﬁgure 3.18 and described below. A mobile robot freely

moves in an environment while using its sensor to observe unknown land-
marks that are assumed to be stationary.

the vector describing the position of the ith stationary landmark
the observation, taken from the robot, of the ith landmark at time k

FIGURE 3.18: The SLAM problem, as described in [39]

Motion tracking and natural feature extraction techniques described in
previous sections are the usual base tools for solving the SLAM problem,
as the landmarks mentioned in the formal deﬁnition typically are natural
features extracted with algorithms such as those discussed in section 3.2.2.
The position of the camera and the observed landmarks are then inferred but,
as noise and inaccuracies are unavoidable, methods have to be developed to
cope with them. A very widely-used option is the extended Kalman [76]
ﬁlter (EKF), sometimes with specially trained neural networks [61, 68].

Researchers have been very active trying to solve the problem in the last
decades and many approaches have in fact been explored. Some involve
multiple robots building the map together while others focus on solving the
same problem for hand-held or hand-worn devices (such as PTAM [80]).

Recent years have seen compelling commercial products start to appear,
with Google Tango17 or Microsoft Hololens (further discussed in 6.1) both
providing spatial mapping capabilities.

Chapter 4

Virtual Reality and its use cases

VR can be used in a very wide range of domains.
It is in fact impossible
to name all of those ﬁelds of applications but a number of examples of use
cases and ongoing researches will be discussed in this chapter. Even though
entertainment currently is the main driver for VR, we will focus on more
"serious" applications.

4.1 Healthcare

VR users can experience a sense of presence [145] and that is key to various
treatments for mental conditions (e.g. anxiety and speciﬁc phobias). In fact,
a term has even been coined: virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). That
kind of treatment has been applied to ﬂying phobia [15], fear of heights [136,
84] or spiders [25, 54], but also to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with
applications to World Trade Center victims [34] or individuals suffering from
combat-related PTSD [130] like US Vietnam [135] or Iraq [57] veterans.

But VR applications to medicine are not limited to psychiatric and behav-
ioral healthcare, it has also been used in neuropsychology, for the assessment
and rehabilitation of disabilities that result from brain injury, memory im-
pairments or attention deﬁcits [132], while others have focused on stroke re-
habilitation [70, 88, 139]. VR can also be used for pain distraction (e.g. during
painful interventions) and even chronic pain [117, 151].

4.2 Computer-aided design

Computer-aided design (CAD) describes the use of computers to create, an-
alyze and optimize designs. It can be applied to many domains, including
mechanical, electronic or even orthopedic design activities as well as the ar-
chitecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. In the context of ar-
chitectural design, the term "Computer-aided architectural design" (CAAD)
is often used to describe softwares that accommodate the speciﬁc needs of
the ﬁeld. Those systems can often beneﬁt from computer-generated envi-
ronments, the term "Virtual engineering" has even been coined and is now
widely used in the automotive industry [73]. Even though they are not al-
ways combined with VR, those systems can really beneﬁt from that technol-
ogy as a strong sense of presence has also been assessed in that context [63].

30

Chapter 4. Virtual Reality and its use cases

For example, in the aerospace industry or more speciﬁcally in cockpit de-
sign, VR can greatly help in evaluating the ergonomics of complex interfaces.
A pilot can visualize how the product would look and perform usual actions
on it, as pictured in ﬁgure 4.1. The way he interacts with it can be analyzed
and engineers can then validate their virtual prototype.

FIGURE 4.1: Usual actions performed by a pilot in the "after
landing" procedure [128]

The technology has also been used for assembly [71, 149] and manufac-
turing [110] simulations, as well as scientiﬁc visualization (as part of a prod-
uct’s design phase). The latter category includes ﬂuid simulations such as
the airﬂow visualization tool [21, 22] developed by NASA.

But VR is not limited to single-user experiences and it is in fact a great tool

for participatory design [20, 23, 119] where all stakeholders are involved.

4.3 Education and training

The ability to visualize 3D models and environments as if you were part of
it can prove very useful in an educational and training contexts, especially
when coupled with haptic feedback. Learning by doing is not really different
from what one can do through a ﬁrst-person virtual experience, which means
similar learning beneﬁts should be observed.

For instance, surgical education typically involves animal cadavers or
plastic mock-ups but using VR training in that context [8] was proven to
be successful [150] with signiﬁcant improvements on the trainees’ part. Sim-
ilarly, interesting results were achieved by using the technology for teach-
ing in various domains such as anatomy [112], foreign languages or supply
chain. The "fun" aspect of VR probably also helps in keeping users’ attention
high, which positively affects their performance.

Being able to simulate extreme conditions that would be costly or even
risky for users is also a big advantage of virtual reality training, with exam-
ples dedicated to ﬁreﬁghters and ﬁre victims [163] or even astronauts [42,
6].

4.4. Culture and tourism

4.4 Culture and tourism

While VR experiences cannot really be a substitute for real travel, the ability
to be transported into places that no longer exist, even if it is only virtual, is
attractive.

In fact, VR was already being used for cultural heritage [52, 118] prior to

the democratization of HMDs for the general public.

More recent examples include applications that allows virtual visitors to
see ancient Rome1 or Jerusalem2 (a capture from within the application is
shown in ﬁgure 4.2).

Chapter 5

Exploring Augmented Reality
applications

As with VR, AR can be used in very different applications. This chapter will
discuss a few domains where AR proved helpful. Some examples will vol-
untarily look similar to what was presented in the previous chapter because,
in fact, there is an overlap between AR and VR’s ﬁelds of application.

5.1 Entertainment

The entertainment industry provides a major ﬁeld of application for AR. It
is once again impossible not to mention the game Pokémon Go as it truly
brought AR to the masses (at a very basic level but it did help popularize the
concept). Another common use of AR is in sports broadcasting, as already
mentioned in section 2.1.

Nevertheless, AR entertainment is not limited to smartphones and TVs.
Skemmi1, a Belgian company, fully understands that as they are specialized
in mass-interactive experiences generally involving AR. A signiﬁcant part of
their work involves cinema events, where everyone in the public can play an
AR game broadcasted on the giant screen, using gestural interaction (e.g. by
slicing virtual fruits with an arm movement).

For the launch of Disney’s Vaiana, they even enhanced the experience by
turning the usual intra-cinema competition to a cinema battle. Two different
rooms were in fact competing against each other, trying to paddle as fast as
possible so that a pirogue could reach its goal2.

But that kind of experience is not only intended at entertaining people,
as psychology studies [116] have shown that collective experiences have a
positive impact on several aspects and can be used to strengthen collective
identity or self-esteem for example in the context of teambuilding activities.
Other somewhat popular applications of AR in the entertainment indus-
try are card [86, 90] and board [4, 67, 106] games. Commercial examples of
the former include Genesis3 and Drakerz4, pictured in ﬁgure 5.1.

Chapter 5. Exploring Augmented Reality applications

FIGURE 5.1: Drakerz, an AR collectible card game5

Augmenting those "physical" games with animated characters and other
elements can enable very interesting and immersive experiences, by combin-
ing the tangible aspect of traditional games with the aesthetics and anima-
tions of computer games.

5.2 Retail industry, with a practical example

As part of an entrepreneurial project and together with 4 other students, we
developed an AR catalog application. The idea is that potential purchases
such as furnitures can sometimes look good but, once bought, they do not
always ﬁt in their ﬁnal environment (wrong dimensions, colors or "style").

In order to avoid that problem, we propose CatARlog, a mobile applica-
tion that uses AR to let end customers visualize how objects will look like in
their own interior (proof-of-concept shown in ﬁgure 5.2). Users simply have
to download the store-speciﬁc application and place a ﬂyer on the ﬂoor that
is used as an AR marker. Then, the application lets them choose from a set of
models from that store.

Similar applications have been developed, for large companies such as
IKEA, Lego or Converse. With CatARlog, we are also targeting SMBs (small
and medium size businesses) that generally do not have the same kind of
budget.

Figure 5.3 shows that most people are interested in that kind of applica-
tion (the data comes from a survey we conducted with 50 "random" persons).
Additionally, a study from Retail Perceptions6 that questioned more than a
thousand US citizens about AR shows, among other things, that 71% of shop-
pers would shop at a retailer more often if they offered such a service. That
interest shown by end users is encouraging for the future of AR in retail and
a few companies do believe in its potential in that context, such as Augment7
and DigitalBridge8.

5.3 Healthcare

As with VR, the sense of presence (here enhanced by the fact that the user
can actually see his own hands and the real world) can help in exposure ther-
apies for several types of psychological problems, such as spider and cock-
roach phobias [14, 75]. Figure 5.4 pictures different steps of an AR exposure
therapy. More recent work that also includes environmental awareness and
does not require markers can be seen at [114].

Other applications include an AR treatment for phantom limb pain [26],

overlays for surgeries [47, 140] and post-stroke hand rehabilitation [65].

Chapter 5. Exploring Augmented Reality applications

FIGURE 5.4: Augmented reality exposure therapy for spider
and cockroach phobias [75]

5.4 Education and training

In education, AR has been used to teach anatomy [13], maths and geometry
[78], engineering [92] or even astronomy [44]. Figure 5.5a shows one of these
examples in a collaborative teaching context, with a superimposed model of
a cone being worked on.

AR has also been employed to train individuals for assembly tasks [161,
126], including motherboard installation as shown in ﬁgure 5.5b, and mili-
tary operations, such as room-clearing scenarios [18] and in the context of
urban terrains [96].

5.5 Architecture, engineering and construction

As with VR, applications in the AEC industry are numerous, with informa-
tion overlaid onto buildings using a mobile application [7] or students’ cre-
ations superimposed in the middle of a square (see ﬁgure 5.6) to evaluate
their design [124] .

When maintaining roads or constructing buildings and if the correspond-
ing data/application are available, AR can help visualize underground pipes
and subsurface data, as discussed in [89, 131, 142]. Companies like Bentley9
have also shown interest in using that kind of subsurface visualization.

5.6 Culture and tourism

Binoculars are widely used in speciﬁc touristic locations, allowing visitors to
see and zoom in the surroundings for a few minutes by putting a coin in.
Those experiences can be augmented [45] by integrating elements on top of
the view: some information or pointers and even buildings or structures. As
most people (or at least families) now own a smartphone, similar experiences
can be offered via mobile devices [81, 165].

Similarly, cultural heritage sites can beneﬁt from the technology, by su-
perimposing monuments that have since disappeared or virtual inhabitants
of the corresponding period [113, 159]. Another use of AR in that context has
been described in [28], where hard-to-observe animal engravings are high-
lighted in real time on a smartphone. Similarly, SAR can be used to colorize
archaeological artifacts [129], as seen in ﬁgure 5.7. Those artifacts can also
be felt if an haptic interface is being coupled with AR, as in [36], where the
technology was used in museums to create the illusion of feeling objects that
are otherwise impossible to touch.

temporary exposition in Rome [129]

5.7

Industrial maintenance and complex tasks

For the highly demanding technical work that is often required in industrial
maintenance, AR can come to help, for instance by providing additional in-
formation superimposed on an object or by displaying a 3D model of the
piece being maintained [146]. It has been used for helping welders in the au-
tomotive industry [41] as well as the personnel responsible for maintaining a
pump [55].

As operators sometimes need the help of a remote engineer, collaborative
AR systems can be a better way of indicating speciﬁc pieces than describing
them orally. Such remote assistance AR systems were developed in [16] and
[10].

Complex assembly tasks typically require the use of manuals containing
instructions. Those manuals can be (partly) replaced by AR systems display-
ing the same instructions and adding world-anchored indications. Those
kinds of applications have been developed for domains such as the aerospace
[148] or food [123] industries. Figure 5.8 shows usual augmented elements
used in the latter context.

FIGURE 5.8: Usual virtual objects that are used in an AR main-
tenance application for the food industry [123]

Chapter 6

Spatial-aware augmented reality

This chapter will present what we chose to call spatial-aware augmented re-
ality (spatial-mapped AR or surroundings-aware AR would have been valid
names too). This subset of AR has a better understanding of the environment
than traditional AR, it does not simply add augmented content "blindly", nei-
ther does it rely on (ﬁducial) markers to place that content.

6.1 Microsoft Hololens

An example of a device enabling spatial-aware experiences is Microsoft Hololens.
The real innovation with this headset is that it combines several advanced
technologies into a single, autonomous and portable device (shown in ﬁgure
6.1).

FIGURE 6.1: Microsoft Hololens, a spatial-aware AR HMD1

6.1.1 The hardware

The Hololens uses see-through lenses and 2 light engines to project the aug-
mented content. It automatically calibrates pupillary distance, has a "holo-
graphic resolution" of 2.3M total light points and a "holographic density" of
more than 2.5k light points per radian. In order to scan the environment,
it uses 4 dedicated cameras, in addition to the depth camera and the 2MP
photo/video camera (see ﬁgure 6.2). It also has an IMU (inertial measure-
ment unit, to track head movements), 4 microphones, an ambient light sensor
and a spatial sound system. More information can be found at [27, 30]. As
discussed in section 3.1.4, an IMU alone is not sufﬁcient to track something
continuously. Unfortunately, Microsoft did not reveal the method they used
to remove unavoidable drifts but they did explain [1] that spatial mapping

40

Chapter 6. Spatial-aware augmented reality

was using natural feature extraction (see section 3.2.2) so it is very likely that
positional tracking is corrected that way.

FIGURE 6.2: Microsoft Hololens cameras and sensors2

To process sensors data and camera feeds, Microsoft created a custom
chip called the Holographic Processing Unit (HPU). More information on
that particular component of the device can be found in [17].

6.1.2

"Mixed reality" experiences

Microsoft and lots of websites describe the Hololens as a mixed reality de-
vice. While this is not fundamentally false, it leads to confusion as MR is thus
often misunderstood as "AR with real world understanding and anchoring".
As explained in chapter 2, MR is a superset of AR, therefore neither a subset
nor something different from AR. In fact, the Hololens is an AR device and
Hololens applications are AR experiences.

That being said, spatial-aware AR has many current and potential appli-
cations. Just like VR, entertainment and more speciﬁcally video games have
embraced the technology. But there are also lots of industrial applications,
most of whom are yet to be explored.

For example, the AEC (architecture, engineering and construction) indus-
try could beneﬁt from such a technology. They already transitioned from 2D
hand drawings to 2D digital plans, then to 3D models. But current 3D models
are currently stuck behind a 2D screen. What if they could be integrated into
the real world (say on a table) and designers could collaborate on it in real
time (potentially even remotely)? Figure 6.3 shows Sketchup for Hololens,
an example of a commercial AEC application from Trimble [3].

The technology can also be used in maintenance (or more generally when
expertise is needed) where lengthy manuals can be replaced by an applica-
tion that directly integrates instructions and indicators onto the correspond-
ing parts of the object that is being worked on. Combined with things like
voice recognition, it is also possible to achieve a quick and hands-free expe-
rience that improves productivity.

FIGURE 6.3: Sketchup, real-time collaboration for the AEC in-
dustry3

An example of such an application (that also includes remote collabora-
tion) for "pipe maintenance" can be seen in [11]. Lots of other scenarios in
the retail industry or in education beneﬁting from the Hololens and similar
devices can be imagined but will not be discussed here.

6.2 Other devices

In this section, we will talk about competitors to the Hololens, with a few
devices able to deliver similar experiences (or believed to be).

6.2.1 Direct competitors

Meta

Meta4 is an American company that developed Meta 1 and, since December
2016, Meta 2. They both are see-through AR HMDs equipped with a 3D
camera, capable of recognizing gestures and superimposing holograms into
the real world. While Meta 1 was somewhat limited (e.g. with a 23-degree
ﬁeld of view), Meta 2 is aiming at competing with the Hololens. Its main
characteristics are:

• 90-degree ﬁeld of view (much better than the Hololens’ speculated 30

degrees5)

• 2560x1440 display resolution

• 720p front-facing camera

• hand tracking capabilities

• tethered (requires a Windows 8+ PC)

• can be preordered for $949

Chapter 6. Spatial-aware augmented reality

Magic Leap

Magic Leap is a very secretive American startup that was able to raise $1.4
billion from investors including major companies such as Google, Qualcomm
or Alibaba Group. Since then, the company has been working in "stealth
mode" and whether their product achieves what can be seen in their con-
cept video6 is currently unknown (so are the hardware speciﬁcations and the
price). We only know they want to create a standalone device with a very
wide ﬁeld of view.

DAQRI

DAQRI is another American company selling AR headsets. It should also
be mentioned that in 2015 they acquired ARToolWorks, the company that
initially released ARToolKit. They ﬁrst started with an AR helmet (to meet
the safety requirements in speciﬁc industries) with special components such
as thermal sensors but are now also selling "standard" AR glasses for $4995.
Both of those devices are using a RealSense 3D camera (from Intel, based on
technologies from the Belgian company SoftKinetic) and are offering a 44-
degree ﬁeld of view.

Others

Other devices worth mentioning are castAR and ODG’s R-8 and R-9. Those
see-through glasses are yet to be released but promise very high ﬁeld of view.

6.2.2 Other versions of the Hololens

A "Hololens v2" was meant to be released (an improved and consumer-ready
version) but the project has been sidelined. Instead, the focus will be on a
"Hololens v3" planned for 2019, that will most likely introduce major im-
In addition to that, Microsoft revealed they partnered with

several companies (Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo) to create tethered VR
headsets with cameras. As of now, it hasn’t been clariﬁed whether those
cameras will enable video see-through AR or "simply" provide real world in-
formation. Those headsets should be available for sale later this year (2017)
for $300.

6.3 A practical example: HoloEscape

As an illustration of what spatial-aware AR can achieve and in order to vali-
date the practical usability of such applications, a game has been developed
as part of the present master’s thesis. HoloEscape runs on the Hololens, in-
volves spatial mapping and basic understanding as well as gestural interac-
tion and gaze input.

6https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPMHcanq0xM

6.3. A practical example: HoloEscape

43

It has been presented during the "Printemps des Sciences" on March 25-
26, 2017 (a public event in Mons, Belgium). As end-user (informal) feed-
back was intended to be gathered during that event and given that the public
mainly consisted of families with children, developing a game seemed like
an obvious choice and was in fact conﬁrmed by the constant line of people
wanting to try it.

The device (Microsoft Hololens) was chosen because it is so innovative:
being able to see the real world through autonomous glasses capable of su-
perimposing holograms anchored in the environment (occluding the mod-
els if necessary thanks to the spatial mapping capabilities) had never been
achieved before. In addition to that, as the device was fairly new (it was not
even purchasable in Belgium when this master’s thesis started), the ability to
develop software for it was a unique chance that could not be missed.

6.3.1 Game description

The game itself is a "reversed tower defense" where the player controls a
virtual ball using gaze input. His goal is to make it reach the end of a holo-
graphic road (displayed on the ﬂoor) without touching electric walls. Hostile
turrets can be added by positioning printed images (which means spectators
can effectively take part in the game). Once in position, those turrets will
constantly shoot at the player that needs to dodge the resulting laser beams.
When the ball touches a wall or is hit by a laser beam, the player looses
one life (out of 3). To enhance spectators’ experience, a few mobile mini-
games were developed and allowed players to affect the Hololens gameplay.
For instance, getting bad scores on a Flappy Bird clone led to a bigger ball
(harder to control) and faster beams whereas winning on a Breakout clone
could lead to an "unbreakable" ball and slower beams.

Figure 6.4 helps clarifying the concept (a video is also available at [32]).

FIGURE 6.4: HoloEscape: Game concept

6.3.2 Technologies

The main technologies the project is built on will be introduced in this sec-
tion. Potential alternatives will be discussed and choices will be explained.
That includes the game engine as well as features such as spatial mapping

44

Chapter 6. Spatial-aware augmented reality

and gaze input. Finally, the tool used to recognize printed images will be
presented and evaluated.

Unity

Unity7 is a leading game engine, used by millions of people every day (ac-
cording to their website). It can produce games for many desktop, mobile
and console platforms and is recommended by Microsoft for building 3D
Hololens applications. Other alternatives include UrhoSharp8 (.NET bind-
ings of Urho3D9) and even direct DirectX projects.

Because it is recommended and widely used, Unity has been chosen. It
should however be mentioned that the process for building Hololens appli-
cations is a bit unusual. Whereas "standard" platforms can be targeted via a
simple compilation in Unity’s editor, building for Hololens requires an ad-
ditional step as Unity is only able to create an intermediary Visual Studio10
solution. That solution can then be compiled to the actual application (inside
Visual Studio). The need to rely on two different compilers leads to issues
that will be further discussed in section 6.3.3.

Spatial Mapping

Using the hardware described in section 6.1.1, the Hololens is able to recon-
struct triangle meshes representing its understanding of the environment (ex-
ample shown in ﬁgure 6.5).

6.3. A practical example: HoloEscape

45

In the "Holographic Academy"12 (containing a few tutorials explaining
how to use the device with Unity) and in the "HoloToolkit for Unity"13 (a
GitHub repository gathering lots of scripts and components related to Hololens
development), Microsoft shows how to access and process that spatial map-
ping data.

The components they provide come with a few parameters to address the
needs of the developers (mesh "resolution", "scanning zone", delay between
spatial mapping updates, etc).

In the context of HoloEscape, the only thing we need to extract from that
mesh is the ﬂoor (to place holographic roads and the ball). To achieve that
goal, a possibility is to use HoloToolkit’s SurfaceMeshesToPlanes14 that will
"convert" the meshes to planes. In our case, we are only interested in hori-
zontal planes as they are good candidates for the ﬂoor. It has been chosen to
then select the lowest of those candidates that is close enough to the user. In
most cases, this will correctly pick the plane that corresponds to the ﬂoor of
the room the user is in. The only issue I encountered is when the user looks at
a contiguous room through a glass during the scanning process. If that other
room is lower than the room the user is in, the wrong plane will be picked.
As those condition are quite far-fetched and easily avoidable by not looking
at that other room, no speciﬁc logic was implemented to prevent the issue
from happening.

Another possibility would have been to use Spatial Understanding scripts15.

Those components go beyond a simple "meshes to planes" conversion, they
provide a better and higher-level understanding of the environment (exam-
ple shown on ﬁgure 6.6).

These scripts were initially developed by Asobo Studios17, a video game
development company based in Bordeaux, France. They had to develop
those features for their games18 but then decided to share the corresponding
code. Their work is available through a DLL (compiled from their codebase
in C++) exposed to Unity in the HoloToolkit.

One should note that it is also possible (using the device portal available
through a local website) to obtain a complete mesh for an entire "mixed real-
ity capture", as seen in ﬁgure 6.7.

FIGURE 6.7: A mesh obtained from a mixed reality capture that

Gaze input

As explained in section 6.3.1, gaze input is used to control the virtual ball
in our game. We already know that the IMU (see section 6.1.1) is tracking
head movements but we have yet to explain how that data can be used by
developers. That part is in fact very simple: the main camera of the Unity
scene is "mapped" to head movements, its forward vector therefore indicates
where the user is looking. It is then fast forward to search for an intersection
between a target surface and the semi-straight line produced by that vector
(see ﬁgure 6.8).

As with any kind of sensor, there is noise in the raw data received from
the IMU which can cause jitter when displaying the cursor. Once again, the
HoloToolkit proves to be useful as it contains a GazeStabilizer script that can
be used to smooth that data (different smoothing ﬁlters can of course be ap-
plied if needed).

Image recognition and tracking

In order to add turrets, one has to place printed images on the ﬂoor and
"show" them to the camera. A very well-known, open-source and widely
used possibility is ARToolkit21. Unfortunately, it does not currently support
Hololens even though Qian et al. announced they successfully integrated
ARToolkit 5 with it [120].

Vuforia22 ofﬁcially supports Hololens and has therefore been chosen. It is
capable of recognizing and tracking 3D objects (to some extent) but also im-
age targets (using natural feature extraction, see section 3.2.2). The process’
principle is shown in ﬁgure 6.9 (many AR solutions are based on the same
principle). The quality of the tracking in fact highly depends on the features
(sharp, spiked, chiseled details in the image) that Vuforia was able to extract
from the original image. Advices on how to choose and improve those target
images can be found in [93]. The chosen image that contains the university’s
logo is not perfect but is still rated with 5 stars out of 5 by Vuforia’s target
manager, because as seen in the central picture of ﬁgure 6.9, enough features
were found in the background image (mostly on persons) and around the
letters.

FIGURE 6.9: Vuforia’s image tracking principle

With the aim of validating the image recognition solution, a test was un-
dertaken (by the author) and is explained below. The user places a printed
image on the ﬂoor, then moves a few meters back. With the Hololens (run-
ning an application developed for that purpose) on his head, the user slowly
walks towards the image. In the process, he makes sure to keep it in sight
(a cursor is displayed, much like the yellow circle on ﬁgure 6.8, and always
stays on the printed picture). The situation is pictured on ﬁgure 6.10.

FIGURE 6.10: The testing procedure to validate Vuforia’s image
recognition feature

When the user comes close enough to the image, the camera recognizes
it. The distance between the device and the paper is measured (the length of
−→
d on the ﬁgure).

That procedure was tested with a photograph that is classiﬁed as an excel-
lent tracking candidate by Vuforia’s target manager (5 stars out of 5, indicat-
ing that many features have been detected and are spread across the image).
The picture was printed in 5 different sizes (labeled with their approximate
ISO paper format equivalent) to observe the effect of changing the target’s
size on the "recognition distance". The corresponding results are displayed
in table 6.1 and ﬁgure 6.11. Note that A7 is so small it requires the user to
bend a little.

Effect of a varying image size on Vuforia (for

Hololens) "recognition distance" - results

As shown by those results and as expected, increasing the size of the
image helps making it easier to recognize, but that recognizability doesn’t
increase linearly. Another surprising fact is that the standard deviation is
relatively low (less than 2% for all sizes) which means the results were par-
ticularly stable.

6.3.3 Issues and validation

Rather than using a virtual ball, the initial goal was to integrate Sphero23, a
robotic ball controlled via Bluetooth, into the game. The technical difﬁculties
that prevented that from happening will be discussed here.

Connecting Hololens to Sphero directly

Several factors are causing issues when trying to make Hololens and Sphero
communicate:

• Hololens runs on Windows 10, thus able to run "Windows 10 applica-
tions" (technically UWP for Universal Windows Platform). Older APIs
are therefore not available on the device

• The Sphero SDK for Unity only works on Android and iOS which means
the Windows SDK has to be used. That SDK hasn’t been updated in
years (last commit was made in 2013 and it does not work on recent
versions of Windows 10 that are required for the Hololens)

• Unity uses a modiﬁed version of Mono24 that roughly corresponds to
.NET 3.5 ( 10 years old). Newer APIs are therefore not available in Unity
(and some obsolete APIs used in Unity’s Mono cannot be used on the
Hololens)

Even though the Hololens is capable of Bluetooth connectivity, those is-
sues mean that connecting the device with Sphero is not as simple as it should
be. Several forks of the ofﬁcial Sphero SDK for Windows do exist, some of
them are relatively up-to-date and, in a blog post [156], Taulty even managed
to make it work on the Hololens (using SoftPlay’s reworked version25 of the
Sphero SDK).

Unfortunately, that experiment as well as the aforementioned forks are
not targeting 3D Unity applications but "only" standard UWP. What Taulty
did is not replicable and building the corresponding library (RobotKit.dll
from SoftPlay’s GitHub) did not work as exceptions were thrown when try-
ing to retrieve the Bluetooth RFCOMM service that correspond to the Sphero.
At the time of writing, no solution to that problem has been found, neither
by myself nor by Taulty.

Chapter 6. Spatial-aware augmented reality

Using a relay

As a direct connection did not seem possible, another approach was tried:
an Android application acting as a relay. In fact, the Sphero SDK for An-
droid works ﬁne so the ball could be controlled by an Android application
that communicates with the Hololens using WebSockets (corresponding di-
agram shown in ﬁgure 6.12). The exchanged messages use FlatBuffers26 to
format the data in binary buffers (different message types are declared, such
as STATUS_REQUEST or DIRECTIVE, and corresponding data structures are
deﬁned) to be as efﬁcient as possible.

FIGURE 6.12: Android application as a relay using WebSockets

However, using WebSockets appeared to be a bit slow for real-time con-
trol and tracking of the ball (trusting Sphero’s own tracking), as shown by the
tests that were carried out. The corresponding procedure is explained below.
As we are interested in bidirectional communication and because it would
be very difﬁcult to synchronize the Hololens with the Android application,
we measured the round-trip time (RTT) i.e. the total time needed for a mes-
sage sent from the Hololens to return to it.

To be more precise, the Hololens application starts counting when it sends
a message to the phone. As the Android application receives that message,
it replies with a predeﬁned response instantly. When the Hololens receives
that reply, it stops the counter and stores the result. It then waits for a second
and the process can start again (117 complete "trips"). In order to limit inter-
ferences, the Wi-Fi used for that communication is created on a laptop, with
no other devices connected to it. As only one person at a time can wear the
Hololens, the setup has also been tested with live streaming enabled. The
corresponding results are given in table 6.2 and ﬁgure 6.13. Note that the
testing procedure does not take the bluetooth transmission (from the phone
to the ball) into account, but it is considered negligible.

As there was a signiﬁcant amount of outliers, two metrics were added:
the median RTT and the number of RTT above 0.4s (that are not shown on
the plot for readability). Those results show that without streaming, the solu-
tion could be viable but would need some extra precautions to handle "silent
periods" as some messages took way too long. A potential solution could be
to run a timer on the Android application that tells the ball to stop moving

when no directive has been received for a certain delay. On the other hand,
we can see the effect of having streaming enabled: the number of RTTs above
0.4s increases (to reach a bit more than 16% of all samples) and that is hardly
acceptable, even though the median value is reasonable.

Tracking the ball

Despite those mixed results, coupling a somewhat slow WebSockets relay
with an effective tracking system could still yield interesting results. Un-
fortunately, there is currently no way of accessing the raw depth data the
Hololens processes, which means that tracking dynamic objects is difﬁcult
and less accurate than it could be with that data. Consequently, the only
option to track the ball is the front RGB camera (red-green-blue, a standard
color camera). Vuforia is capable of tracking some 3D objects but Sphero is
a rolling sphere, almost entirely white (that can only be lit by a solid color)

52

Chapter 6. Spatial-aware augmented reality

so it is not suitable in itself as there is no interest point to track. To overcome
that issue, a cube with bearing balls has been 3D printed (see ﬁgure 6.14).

FIGURE 6.14: Wireframe model of a 3D printed box for the
Sphero ball

The idea was to put it around the Sphero ball (made with a translucent
material so that the ball’s color is reﬂected) with "trackable" images on some
of its sides. That solution would provide a relatively unstable tracking (issues
when the user would move his head and stop gazing at the ball/cube) and, as
the size of the tracked images would be comparable to the "A7" image from
table 6.1, similar tracking distances would be observed (the user would have
to stay close to the ball). More importantly, it would not allow streaming as
only one process can have access to the Hololens’ front (and only accessible)
camera at any time27. As this project was to be presented in public events,
such a limitation was inappropriate and the virtual ball was the only viable
solution.

Chapter 7

Current limitations and foreseeable
prospects

VR enables a wide range of applications and can deeply change a set of hu-
man endeavors, as seen in chapter 4, through short-term experiences. The
necessary equipment is relatively mature, whereas AR’s potential (in par-
ticular through head-worn displays) currently is more restrained by the un-
derlying technological needs. However, once these problems will be solved,
AR could be integrated in our daily lives. This chapter will discuss current
limitations and future prospects, for both ﬁelds.

7.1 Displays

In their famous and previously cited paper [104], Milgram et al. identiﬁed
the needs for optical see-through displays: “accurate and precise, low latency
body and head tracking, accurate and precise calibration and viewpoint matching,
adequate ﬁeld of view, [...] a snug (no-slip) but comfortable and preferably untethered
head-mount”.

While the Hololens’ head tracking and viewpoint matching are already
compelling, inside an untethered (autonomous and wireless) device, the ﬁeld
of view still is a major issue. As previously discussed (section 6.2.1), competi-
tors announced much wider ﬁeld of views but whether their promises will
be delivered remains to be seen.

As already mentioned in section 2.1, retinal displays could very well be
the future as they could potentially combine more portability, a very wide
ﬁeld of view and less eye-tiredness. The VR industry could beneﬁt from it
but it would truly be a game changer for AR as small ﬁeld of views and
unsuitability for outdoor use are the usual issues for see-through devices.
Reducing eye-tiredness is also key to long term (maybe even permanent) use.
Many people wear glasses constantly so size and weight should not really
be an issue but if tinier displays are desired, contact lenses are also a possi-
bility. In fact, in 2014, Samsung patented [79] such AR lenses in South Korea.
The patent application describes the lenses as equipped with a camera, an
antenna and several sensors (according to a brief translation from [51]).

The patent shows that it might be a work in progress but lenses are so
small that compelling experiences look out of reach in the near future. Even
though simple overlays could potentially be superimposed at some point,

54

Chapter 7. Current limitations and foreseeable prospects

with the computing part handled by a smartphone, latency would probably
be a problem. Another issue to solve is power supply, how would lenses get
enough energy to run the hardware?

7.2 Computing resources and sensors

As the hardware gets shorter, more powerful and more efﬁcient, head-mounted
devices will continue to evolve, with more capabilities in "more wearable"
devices.

In terms of pure computing power, it is highly likely that we will see more
ASICs (application-speciﬁc integrated circuits) inside those devices, that will
be better suited for particular purposes such as computer vision (e.g. DSP
for digital signal processor and VPU for vision processing unit).

Conventional silicon chips have already been pushed to their limits in
terms of speed (or will soon be). In fact, recent years have focused on par-
allelizing several processors to try and compensate for the lack of speed in-
crease. That being said, graphene processors are the future and will be much
faster and smaller while requiring much less power [147]. Those properties
could obviously be helpful for wearable devices.

Similarly, computer vision and the SLAM problem will keep being active
research domains. As algorithms get better, be it in terms of accuracy, robust-
ness or complexity, spatial-aware AR experiences will improve.

All those elements will probably lead to more broadly-available and af-
fordable head-worn devices capable of enabling compelling AR/VR expe-
riences but the upcoming addition of depth cameras to mobile phones will
most likely play an even more important role in the democratization of spatial-
aware AR. In fact, devices equipped with such depth sensors start to appear,
e.g. with the ZenFone AR1, a high-end smartphone oriented towards con-
sumers and that should be released in summer 2017.

7.3

Interaction

Wearing an HMD enabling immersive or world anchored 3D experiences
also requires special considerations with regards to how users can interact
with it.

Firstly, new kinds of UIs (user interfaces) need to be designed. In standard
computer 3D applications such as games, information is often overlaid onto
the virtual camera’s view (e.g. to display a health bar). The same concept
cannot be applied to optical see-through devices such as the Hololens, as
the rendering’s proximity to the user’s eyes would be uncomfortable. The
usual solution is to use a 3D UI integrated into the environment (possibly
positioned depending on the user’s gaze direction) instead of being attached
to the camera. An example of such a UI is shown in ﬁgure 7.1.

7.3. Interaction

55

FIGURE 7.1: Example of a UI anchored in the environment,
with buttons to interact with a 3D model2

In order to interact with those UIs and other models, it is also necessary to
provide some kind of gestural interaction as traditional input devices such as
mouses and keyboards are generally not desirable (they are not adapted for
that purpose). Speech recognition could also be an important part of those
new interfaces but it still is a difﬁcult problem, especially in noisy environ-
ments.

On a more personal note, I do believe that the usual approach of trying
to "map" traditional input to a new kind of input (e.g. replacing a mouse
click with a click gesture) might be the best approach for short term goals
but is not advisable for the long run. New kinds of interactive environments
should go along with new paradigms, even though technology is not ready
yet for the futuristic AR interfaces (picture shown in ﬁgure 7.2) seen in the
previously mentioned Iron Man movie3.

Chapter 7. Current limitations and foreseeable prospects

Another way to get user input is by using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
The idea is to analyze neural activity and map it to some kind of basic action.
Different types of techniques can be used to monitor neural activity, inva-
sive (implanted directly into the grey matter) and non-invasive (external de-
vices) methods exist, with measurements typically taken by EEGs (electroen-
cephalograms, analyzing the brain’s activity) or EMGs (electromyogramsn
analyzing muscular activity). Figure 7.3 pictures a non-intrusive system used
in the context of neurorehabilitation in stroke.

FIGURE 7.3: A EEG-based BCI example with robotic feedback
[5]

Interesting results have been achieved, with promising applications, espe-
cially for individuals with muscular handicaps [53, 64, 85] but also for certain
types of autism, with BCI sometimes coupled with VR [153].

However, current state-of-the-art methods are limited to a set of prede-
ﬁned simple actions and requires a signiﬁcant amount of preliminary user
training, mainly in research settings. Understanding complex intent (e.g. "go
back to main menu") is completely out of reach as of now.

So far, this section only talked about what the user sees and how to get
input from him but another important contribution will most likely come
from haptic feedback. While VR enables immersive experiences, it is gener-
ally limited to viewing and listening to virtual content, which means only 2
out of 5 traditional senses can be used by the computer to send information
to the user. In those experiences, the users sometimes manipulate virtual ob-
jects but they usually cannot physically touch them. Haptic interfaces can be
used to make users feel those virtual objects, by applying appropriate forces
where needed.

A popular haptic interface is PHANTOM [100], developed by Massie, Sal-
isbury, et al. in 1994. Since then, the impact of such a technology has then
been analyzed [138], so was its complementarity with VR [43]. Commercial
products also start to appear with (among many others) haptic gloves from

ManusVR5 and even lots of complete body suits being in development such
as the Teslasuit6 or Hardlight’s suit7.

7.4 Social acceptance

Judging by the criticism around Google Glass8 when it was released, mainly
related to privacy issues, it looks like the general public is not ready to ac-
cept other people wearing cameras most of the time. While the HMDs dis-
cussed in chapter 6 dodged the issue by focusing on industrial applications,
the problem remains for ordinary individuals.

On top of that, AR/VR wearables usually look futuristic but cannot really
be considered good-looking by most people. While this is not crucial for their
ability to deliver functional experiences, it might be important for the general
public to embrace them.

Those concerns need to be addressed if we ever want to see AR wearables
integrated into our daily lives, and the miniaturization of those devices will
certainly help with that.

Conclusion

I certainly learned a lot by completing this master’s thesis, in terms of tech-
nologies and potential applications for AR and VR, two ﬁelds I am very in-
terested in. I truly believe both AR and VR will be very beneﬁcial to various
industries in a relatively short term but exploring the possibilities also raised
my expectations for our future daily lives.

Receiving the chance to work with a device as innovative as the Hololens
was really attractive and the trouble related to the issues encountered while
developing the game are no match to the joy of presenting it and seeing
smiles on the players’ face. I cannot thank the Microsoft Innovation Center
enough for that opportunity.

I wish (and in fact plan on) extending the game’s capabilities as real world
geometry and objects could potentially be used to decide where the level’s
roads should be placed, using some kind of spatial-aware procedural level
generation.

As said before, AR and VR will keep growing and it is deﬁnitely excit-
ing, provided that the necessary evolutions in human-computer interactions
follow the same path. Work remains to be done on several aspects of those
domains and I do hope researchers will achieve signiﬁcant progress to allow
ubiquitous computing (every time, everywhere) and a seamless blending be-
tween reality and virtuality. Maybe even by developing wearable devices
capable of switching back and forth between AR and VR modes with adap-
tive transparency?
