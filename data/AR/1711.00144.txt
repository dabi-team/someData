Using Andreev reﬂection (AR) as an experimental gauge of the superconducting proximity eﬀect
(PE), we assess the topological purity of the superconductivity that is induced by the c-axis PE
between an s-wave superconductor and the topological insulators Bi2X3 (X=Se,Te). Point-contact
AR spectroscopy is performed with Nb tips on Bi2X3 single crystals at 4.2 K. Scanning tunneling
spectroscopy is also used, to locate the Fermi level EF relative to the Dirac point in the crystals. The
AR data is analyzed with Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk theory, taking into account tip-induced spin-
orbit coupling, Fermi-surface mismatch, and the co-presence of bulk band and topological surface
states at EF . Our results indicate that the superconductivity that can be proximity-induced into
Bi2X3 is predominantly non-topological.

Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) are a
novel class of materials where strong spin-orbit coupling
causes bulk band inversion, creating surface states with a
Dirac dispersion as well as helical spin polarization that
protects them against back-scattering [1–3]. Ideally, TIs
are bulk insulators with high surface mobility from these
topological surface states (TSS). Realistically, intrinsic
doping from antisite and vacancy defects [3] tends to
shift the Fermi level out of the bulk band gap, allow-
ing non-topological bulk band states (BBS) with ﬁnite
ˆkz-dispersion to also carry current. For the bismuth-
chalcogenide TIs, such non-ideal behavior is widely seen
in single crystals and thin ﬁlms of Bi2X3 (X = Se,Te).

It was theoretically proposed that the TSS on an ideal
TI can, through the proximity eﬀect (PE) with a spin-
singlet superconductor (SC), be used to generate topo-
logical superconductivity and thereby Majorana fermion
states [4, 5]. Following this proposal, there have been nu-
merous experimental studies of the superconducting PE
on Bi2X3 samples, most of which show non-ideal TI be-
havior [6–18]. These experiments are primarily based on
s-wave pairing in two types of heterostructures (see Fig-
ure S1 in supplement): TI/SC, where the PE is primarily
along the c-axis; and SC/TI/SC, where the PE is in the
a-b plane.
In this work, we focus on the c-axis PE in
the TI/SC geometry [19] and ask the central question:
When BBS and TSS are both present at the Fermi level
of a non-ideal TI such as Bi2X3, how topological is the
superconductivity that can be proximity-induced across
the TI’s c-axis interface?

At a metal/SC interface, Andreev reﬂection (AR) is
the process that converts electrons into Cooper pairs
through retro-reﬂection of holes, and is considered to be
the underlying mechanism for the PE [20, 21]. For con-
ventional metals, AR has been extensively studied and
is quite well understood [22–25]. For ferromagnetic met-
als, AR between spin-polarized electrons and spin-singlet
pairs is suppressed, and thus the PE between them is also

suppressed [25–33]. The special attributes of TIs may
also aﬀect AR and thus the PE, since a Dirac dispersion
can modify AR by favoring specular- over retro-reﬂection
[34, 35], and Rashba spin-orbit coupling can weaken AR
also by upsetting retro-reﬂection [36–39]. A more im-
portant issue involves the suppression of AR by Fermi-
surface mismatch across the TI/SC interface [23, 40, 41].
Namely, since the TSS have no ˆkz-dispersion, how well
can they actually sustain AR and thus proximity-couple
with a SC across the TI’s c-axis interface?

To address these questions, we perform point-contact
spectroscopy (PCS) at 4.2 K using Nb tips on c-axis
faces of Bi2X3 single crystals. Scanning tunneling spec-
troscopy (STS) is also used, to determine the location
of the Fermi level in the crystals relative to the Dirac
point. The PCS data show robust AR characteristics
and are analyzed with the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk
(BTK) theory, taking into account tip-induced spin-orbit
coupling, Fermi-surface mismatch, and the co-presence of
BBS and TSS at the Fermi level. Spectral analysis based
on realistic band structures indicates that the c-axis AR
is dominated by the BBS over the TSS, implying that
the superconductivity that can be proximity-induced into
Bi2X3 is predominantly non-topological.

PCS is a well-established technique for studying AR
[25]. It has the advantage of inherently small junctions
that are amenable to BTK modeling and can be checked
for data reproducibility at diﬀerent points on the sam-
ple. Our PCS measurements were made at 4.2 K using
a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Nb tips were
used because Nb is a well-studied superconductor and
devoid of multigap pairing eﬀects that may complicate
data analysis. The STM technique enabled the tip ap-
proach to be gentle, and the junction impedance to be
varied by piezos after tip-sample contact is made. STS
measurements were also made, using either Nb tips at
4.2 K to characterize the SC tip, or Pt-Ir tips down to
300 mK to characterize the TI crystals. The Bi2X3 sin-

varying junction impedances and cleaving environments. To
facilitate comparison, each dI/dV spectrum is divided by its
above-gap value at -15 mV and staggered vertically. All spec-
tra show a double-hump AR structure. (a) and (b) show data
taken on N2- and air-cleaved crystals, respectively. (c) shows
data for a N2-cleaved crystal, taken at higher impedances than
in (a).
In (a), the zero-bias conductance (ZBC) increases
monotonically as junction impedance increases, contrary to
generic spectral dependence on interfacial barrier strength Z
predicted by the BTK model [22] in (d).

Bi2Se3 crystal at 4.2 K. To facilitate comparison, each dI/dV
spectrum is divided by its above-gap value at -25 mV and
staggered vertically. A single- to double-hump evolution
is observed as junction impedance decreases from 85 to 5
Ω, with the ZBC evolving non-monotonically.
(b) Spec-
tral simulations using a BTK model that includes interfa-
cial Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) [37], where Z0 is a
ﬁxed interfacial barrier strength and Z1 is a variable interfa-
cial RSOC strength. As Z1 increases from 0 to 3, the ZBC
non-monotonically increases then decreases, similar to (a). A
ﬁxed broadening parameter Γ of 1.4 meV was used in (b).

gle crystals were n-doped as a result of natural defects
that commonly occur in bismuth chalcogenides [3], and
were cleaved before cooldown and measurement. Details
of our crystal growth, surface preparation, and measure-
ment technique are given in the supplement.

Figure 1 plots PCS data taken with Nb tips on Bi2Te3
crystals at 4.2 K. To compare all data in each plot on
the same scale, each diﬀerential conductance dI/dV spec-
trum is divided by its above-gap value at −15 mV, and
staggered vertically for clarity. Panels (a) and (b) show
data taken on N2- and air-cleaved crystals, respectively.
Panel (c) shows data for a N2-cleaved crystal, taken at
higher impedances than in (a). All spectra have a double-
hump structure, characteristic of subgap enhancement
due to AR, as well as a background asymmetry favoring
positive voltage. The humps are separated by ∼ 3.5 - 5
mV, comparable to the gap-edge separation seen by our
STS data using Nb tips on Ag ﬁlms (Figure S2). The sub-
gap enhancement is generally stronger in (a) and (c) than
in (b), consistent with the crystal surface being cleaner
for N2-cleaving than air-cleaving. The stronger subgap
enhancement of (a) relative to (c) implies stronger AR for
lower junction impedance, consistent with the BTK the-
ory. However, it is notable that the zero-bias conductance
(ZBC) in (a) decreases with lower junction impedance,
contrary to generic spectral behavior predicted by the
BTK model in panel (d). Estimates of the junction size
using the Wexler formula show all junctions to be ballis-
tic [42], indicating that diﬀusive eﬀects are not the source
of this non-BTK behavior at low impedance.

Figure 2(a) shows PCS data taken with a Nb tip on

an air-cleaved Bi2Se3 crystal at 4.2 K. To facilitate com-
parison, each dI/dV spectrum is divided by its above-
gap value at −25 mV and staggered vertically. Here,
a single- to double-hump evolution is observed as the
junction impedance decreases, with the ZBC evolving
non-monotonically. This spectral behavior tends to be
seen for lower junction impedances, and is very similar
to the low-impedance Bi2Te3 data in Figure 1(a), where
the ZBC also evolves in a non-BTK manner.

The non-BTK behavior

low junction
impedance in Figures 1(a) and 2(a) can be explained in
terms of interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC),
which is known to aﬀect AR at low energies [36–39].
For Bi2Se3, RSOC has been observed on crystal surfaces
and attributed to adsorbate-induced band bending that
produces a local electric ﬁeld [43]. In our point-contact
junctions, band bending can likewise be induced by tip-
sample contact due to the large Fermi-energy diﬀerence
between metallic Nb and semimetallic Bi2Se3. Since
band bending is enhanced by junction transparency,
the tip-induced RSOC would increase as the junction
impedance decreases. This RSOC-impedance relation-
ship is consistent with spectral simulations made with a
BTK model that includes interfacial RSOC [37], shown
in Figure 2(b). Here, as the RSOC strength Z1 increases
from 0 to 3, the ZBC non-monotonically increases then
decreases, similar to our data in Figure 2(a).

We note that a broadening parameter Γ of 1.4 meV
was needed in Figure 2(b) to produce ZBC heights sim-
ilar to what we observe in Figure 2(a). We can qualita-

tively explain this non-ideal behavior in terms of spectral
broadening from inelastic scattering at the tip-sample in-
terface, which is generally higher in Nb compared to other
elemental superconductors, and is known to increase with
increasing junction impedance [44, 45]. Additionally,
large spectral broadening has also been observed in re-
cent high-impedance PCS measurements using Nb tips on
bulk-insulating (Bi1−xSbx)2Te3 ﬁlms [46]. Further the-
oretical study is needed to better explain this non-BTK
behavior seen at high junction impedance. Regardless,
the subgap conductance enhancements observed in all of
our PCS data on Bi2X3 are robust signatures of AR.

To determine the location of the Fermi level EF rela-
tive to the Dirac point ED in the Bi2X3 crystals, we ex-
amine cryogenic STS data taken with Pt-Ir tips. Figures
3 and 4 show dI/dV spectra taken on atomically-smooth
Bi2X3 surfaces, which are imaged by STM as shown in
the insets. First, it is worth noting that the spectral
asymmetry of the PCS data is also seen in the STS data,
within the voltage range shown by the red box in each
ﬁgure. Next, a comparison of our STS data for Bi2Se3
(Figure 3) with data taken by angle-resolved photoemis-
sion spectroscopy (ARPES) on similar crystals [47] indi-
cates that our crystals’ EF lies in the BCB, ∼ 350 meV
above ED. For Bi2Te3 however, ARPES has shown [48]
that bulk bands cross ED, meaning the minimum in the
STS spectrum does not coincide with ED as in the case
of Bi2Se3. Nevertheless, using similar spectral analysis
as Ref. [48], we infer that EF in our Bi2Te3 crystals also
lies in the BCB, ∼ 330 meV above ED.

The fact that EF crosses the BCB in our Bi2X3 crystals
indicates that, in addition to TSS, BBS can also take part
in AR with the Nb tip. This raises a natural question:
to what extent do our observed AR characteristics in-
volve TSS versus BBS? We can qualitatively address this

question with the BTK theory by considering the geome-
try of our TI/SC junction. In the standard BTK model,
b + (1 − rv)2/4rv,
Z 2
junction opacity is given by Z =
where Zb represents interfacial barrier strength and rv
= vN
is the ratio of longitudinal Fermi velocities
across the N/SC interface. For the TSS, vanishing ˆkz-
dispersion implies severe vF -mismatch (rv ≪ 1) with Nb
along the c-axis, thus suppressing AR (Z ≫ 1) even for a
perfectly metallic interface (Zb = 0). Such a large Z is in-
consistent with our measured subgap enhancement. The
BBS, however, have substantial ˆkz-dispersion, so their
vF -matching with Nb is signiﬁcantly better, allowing AR
to occur. Comparing the Z values estimated with this
model for the TSS/Nb and BBS/Nb scenarios [49] shows
that our AR data is better explained by the latter.

The above analysis can be reﬁned by using extensions
of the BTK model [40, 50, 51] that account for the de-
pendence of junction transmission on injection angle θ,
as detailed in the supplement. Essentially, conservation
of momentum transverse to the junction normal intro-
duces a Fermi wavevector-matching term kN
and
an angle-dependent barrier term Zb/ cos θ that both en-
ter into Z. Spectral simulations based on the model
[51] are plotted in Figure 5(a) to compare
from Ref.
the TSS/Nb and BBS/Nb scenarios. The TSS/Nb spec-
trum appears gapped,
indicating suppression of AR,
while the BBS/Nb spectrum shows a double-hump AR
structure similar to our background-normalized data (see
supplement for details). We note that subgap suppres-
sion similar to the TSS curve in Figure 5(a) was re-
cently observed in high-impedance PC junctions on bulk-
insulating (Bi1−xSbx)2Te3 ﬁlms [46], and was attributed
to the helical spin-polarization of the TSS.

To visualize why c-axis AR is suppressed for TSS but
robust for BBS, we examine the Fermi-surface projec-

tions between Bi2X3 and Nb along ˆkz. As illustrated in
Figure 6, the BBS Fermi sphere projects as two domes
onto the Nb Fermi sphere, whereas the TSS Fermi sur-
face is a circle that projects as two circles onto the Nb
Fermi sphere. Three key facts are worth noting. First,
since these projections correspond to allowed interfacial
scattering processes and thus include states that allow
AR, the phase space for AR is clearly larger for BBS
than for TSS. Second, although TSS and BBS are simi-
larly kF -matched with Nb, the vF -matching for TSS/Nb
is invariably poor because TSS have vanishing dispersion
along ˆkz, and thus Z ≫ 1. Third, since TSS/Nb trans-
mission corresponds to θ = π/2, it is suppressed by the
Zb/ cos θ term for any non-zero Zb. All three facts indi-
cate that TSS contribute negligibly to c-axis AR when
BBS are also present.

One possible way that TSS can contribute to AR is if
the junction has regions that are not normal to the c-
axis of Bi2X3. Since the TSS has ﬁnite dispersion in the
ˆkx-ˆky plane, these non-normal regions may allow bet-
ter vF -matching with Nb and thus small enough Z for
AR to occur. To consider this possibility, we assume
that a Bi2X3/Nb point-contact has both c-axis and in-
plane interfaces with area πa2 and circumference 2πa
respectively, where a is the contact radius. Applying
the BTK model from Figure 5(a) to both interfaces, we
ﬁnd that AR can now occur for TSS/Nb channels via
the in-plane interface, but much more weakly than the
BBS/Nb channels via the c-axis interface. For this multi-
interface model, Figure 5(b) plots the dI/dV spectra in
units of e2/h, where the spectral weighting is determined
by the corresponding number of Landauer channels for

FIG. 6. Schematic Fermi-surface projections between Bi2X3
and Nb, corresponding to conservation of Fermi wavevector
transverse to the junction normal (ˆkz). The BBS Fermi sur-
face (left sphere) projects as two domes onto the Nb Fermi
surface (right sphere), whereas the TSS Fermi surface (left
circle) projects as two circles onto the Nb Fermi surface. The
phase space of states available for AR is clearly larger for BBS
than for TSS.

each interface (see supplement), showing double-hump
AR characteristics for both the TSS/Nb and BBS/Nb
cases. Once again, the larger AR phase space for the
BBS/Nb channels gives them stronger spectral weight
compared to the TSS/Nb channels.

Finally, the inherently larger AR phase space for BBS
versus TSS has an important implication for the super-
conducting PE in Bi2X3/Nb junctions. Since AR is the
underlying mechanism for the PE, this phase-space dis-
parity again favors BBS over TSS. On the reasonable as-
sumption that the PE induces topological superconduc-
tivity on TSS but non-topological superconductivity on
BBS, the greater spectral weighting of BBS over TSS in
our observed AR implies that the superconductivity that
can be proximitized by Nb across the c-axis interface of
Bi2X3 has a greater non-topological component than a
topological one. In order to suppress the non-topological
component, one would need to suppress BBS by shifting
the EF of Bi2X3 to within the bulk band gap, for ex-
ample by compensation doping, electrostatic gating, or
photo-illumination [3, 52–54]. Recent PE and PCS ex-
periments that use bulk-insulating samples [15, 46, 55]
and study dependence on bulk-conduction [14, 17, 56–
58] have made signiﬁcant progress in this regard. How-
ever, as EF moves close enough to ED, specular AR may
become dominant enough to degrade conventional AR
[34, 35] and thereby the PE [59]. More studies are nec-
essary to elucidate this complex phenomenon, in order
to generate predominantly topological superconductivity
via c-axis proximity coupling between an s-wave super-
conductor and a topological insulator.

where R is point-contact impedance, h is the Planck con-

our crystals and kF ≈ 0.5 nm

S1. GEOMETRIES USED IN TI/SC PE EXPERIMENTS

Experimental studies of the PE on Bi2X3 samples have primarily been based on s-wave pairing in two types of
heterostructures (Figure S1): TI/SC, where the PE is primarily along the c-axis; and SC/TI/SC, where the PE is in
the a-b plane.

FIG. S1. Two types of heterostructures used in proximity-eﬀect experiments between Bi2X3 TIs and s-wave SCs.

S2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

For PCS measurements, dI/dV vs. bias voltage was measured using a four-terminal geometry with an AC resistance
bridge. For STS measurements, standard two-point AC lock-in technique was used. For PCS, the STM approach
method was used to gently bring the tip and sample into contact without crashes. Namely, a piezo stepper motor
with a ∼ 10 nm step size was used to move the tip into tunneling range of the sample. The STM feedback was then
disengaged, the four-terminal wiring engaged, and the tip gently brought into contact with the sample using the STM
piezo. Nb tips of 99.9% purity were cut, then cleaned in situ through high-voltage ﬁeld emission on a Ag ﬁlm. A
typical dI/dV spectrum taken by STS with these tips is shown in Figure S2. Although the superconducting gap of
Nb is ∼ 1.5 meV at 0 K, spectral broadening due to ﬁnite quasiparticle lifetime and broadening of the Fermi-Dirac
function at 4.2 K causes the coherence peaks in STS data to shift to ∼ ± 2.5 mV.

The Bi2X3 single crystals were grown with the self-ﬂux method [1], using excess Se melt for Bi2Se3 and excess Te
melt for Bi2Te3. The crystals were cleaved either in air or in a N2-ﬁlled glovebox. Immediately after cleaving, contacts
were made on the freshly exposed c-axis surface of the crystals using Ag paint, shortly before being loaded into the
STM. Typical atomically-resolved STM topographs of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 crystals are shown in the insets of Figures
3 and 4 in the main text, respectively.

S3. CURRENT FLOW THROUGH BBS

Figure S3 shows a schematic of the contact geometry used in our experiment. It is important to note that in this
geometry, a signiﬁcant amount of current ﬂows via BBS along the c-axis of the crystal. This predominance of BBS is
due to the large diﬀerence in resistance between TSS and BBS, as detailed below.

The sheet resistance corresponding to the TSS in our crystals (see Figure S3) can be estimated as R(cid:3) = 3.69 kΩ
from Ref.
[2], which used electrostatic gating and Ca doping of Bi2Se3 crystals to shift the Fermi level into the
bulk band gap. For non-ideal Bi2Se3 crystals that have dopings similar to ours, the ab-plane and c-axis resistivities
corresponding to the BBS are ρBBS

ab = 0.25 mΩcm [3] and ρBBS

c = 1.1 mΩcm [4].

Using the above values, we ﬁnd that the resistance corresponding to our crystals’ BBS is 6 orders of magnitude
smaller than that of the TSS: the dimensions of our crystals are ∼ 1 x 5 x 5 mm, so the ab-plane and c-axis
ab = (0.25 mΩcm × 0.25 cm) /(0.1 cm × 0.5 cm) = 1.25 mΩ, and
BBS resistances for Bi2Se3 can be estimated as RBBS
RBBS

c = (1.1 mΩcm × 0.1 cm × 2) /(0.1 cm × 0.1 cm) = 22 mΩ. Thus, the BBS shunt much of the current.

FIG. S3. Schematic of our experimental geometry. The BBS shunt much of the current, as indicated by the white arrow.

S4. BACKGROUND CONDUCTANCE NORMALIZATION

Our PCS data can be normalized by dividing out the background conductance, after interpolating the latter from
outside ∼ ± 10 mV using a polynomial ﬁt. An example of this procedure is shown in Figure S4, using Bi2Te3 PCS
data from Figure 1 in the main text. The normalization largely removes the spectral asymmetry, as shown in panel
(b).

background above ± 10 mV. (b) Normalized data, obtained by dividing the dI/dV data by the polynomial ﬁt.

is the Fermi wavevector matching term mentioned in the
main text. This model was used to generate Figure 5(a) in the main text. In our simulation, the rv and rk values
were ﬁxed by the c-axis vF and ab-plane kF values in Table S1, respectively. The other parameters in the model—Zb,
the superconducting energy gap ∆, and a ﬁnite quasiparticle lifetime term Γ—were used as ﬁtting parameters, while
T was ﬁxed at 4.2 K. The values for these ﬁtting parameters were 0.3, 1.5 meV, and 1.1 meV, respectively. As stated
in the main text, this BTK model indicates that TSS contribute negligibly to c-axis AR, when BBS are also present.

q

For our multi-interface BTK model, we assume that a Bi2X3/Nb junction has both c-axis and in-plane interfaces,
as shown in Figure S5. First, we apply the single-interface BTK model to each interface, again using the kF and vF
values from Table S1, but this time using the ab-plane vF for the TSS. Zb, ∆, and Γ were used as ﬁtting parameters
to resemble the data in Figure 2(a), and had values of 0.35, 1.5 meV, and 1.35 meV, respectively. T was again ﬁxed
at 4.2 K.

Next, to weight the BBS’ and TSS’ contributions to the total conductance spectrum, we estimate the number of
/ (4π) =

Landauer conduction channels Nc for each interface. For the BBS’ c-axis interface of area πa2, Nc =
(kF a)2 /4. For the TSS’ in-plane interface of circumference 2πa, Nc = (kF 2πa) /π = 2kF a.

F πa2

Finally, we apply these weightings to the BTK spectra for each interface. While we ﬁnd double-hump AR char-
acteristics for both the BBS/Nb and TSS/Nb channels, once again, the BBS predominate over the TSS. Namely,
