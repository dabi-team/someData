Abstract: We propose a procedure to decide between the null hypothesis of (strict) stationarity

and the alternative of non-stationarity, in the context of a Random Coeﬃcient AutoRegression

(RCAR). The procedure is based on randomising a diagnostic which diverges to positive inﬁnity

under the null, and drifts to zero under the alternative. Thence, we propose a randomised test

which can be used directly and - building on it - a decision rule to discern between the null

and the alternative. The procedure can be applied under very general circumstances: albeit

developed for an RCAR model, it can be used in the case of a standard AR(1) model, without

requiring any modiﬁcations or prior knowledge. Also, the test works (again with no modiﬁcation

or prior knowledge being required) in the presence of inﬁnite variance, and in general requires

minimal assumptions on the existence of moments.

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

2

In this paper, we propose a procedure to decide in favour of, or against, the strict stationarity of a

series generated by a Random Coeﬃcient AutoRegressive (RCAR) model:

Xt = (ϕ + bt) Xt−1 + et,

t <

1

≤

, where X0 is an initial value.

(1.1)

Model (1.1) has been paid considerable attention by the literature, mainly due to its ﬂexibility and

analytical tractability - see Nicholls and Quinn (2012) and the references in Aue and Horv´ath (2011),

and also the article by Diaconis and Freedman (1999) where several examples are discussed. Equation

(1.1) has also become increasingly popular in econometrics. Indeed, it is immediate to see that (1.1)

nests the AR(1) model as a special case, with the advantage that it can be viewed as a competitor for a

model with an abrupt break in the autoregressive root (see, especially, a related paper by Giraitis et al.,

2014). Further, a closely related speciﬁcation is the so-called Double AutoRegressive (DAR) model

Xt = ϕXt−1 + vt with vt =

a + bX 2

t−1ǫt and ǫt is an i.i.d. process; this model, in turn, nests the

popular ARCH speciﬁcation (see Theorem 1 in Tsay, 1987). Finally, (1.1) has been employed as a

q

more general alternative to deterministic unit root processes, with ϕ = 1 and bt not identically zero

- this is known in the literature as the Stochastic Unit Root (STUR) process, and we refer to the

contributions by Granger and Swanson (1997), McCabe and Tremayne (1995) and Leybourne et al.

(1996), among others, for an overview.

Various aspects of the inference on (1.1) are well developed. The estimation of ϕ, in particular,

has been studied in numerous contributions, for both the stationary case (Aue et al., 2006) and the

nonstationary case (Berkes et al., 2009); Aue and Horv´ath (2011) suggest using the Quasi-Maximum

Likelihood (QML) estimator, showing that the estimator of ϕ is always consistent and asymptoti-

cally normal, irrespective of the stationarity (or lack thereof) of Xt, as long as bt is not equal zero

almost surely. The same result has also been shown for several other estimators, like the Weighted

Least Squares (WLS) estimator (see Horv´ath and Trapani, 2016) and the Empirical Likelihood (EL)

estimator, with Hill and Peng (2014) and Hill et al. (2016) showing that standard normal inference

holds for all possible cases.

Conversely, other parts of the inference on (1.1) are not fully established. In particular, only few results

are available as far as testing for the stationarity/ergodicity of Xt is concerned. Most contributions

focus on restricted versions of (1.1), e.g. testing whether Xt is a genuine unit root process versus the

alternative of a STUR process - see McCabe and Tremayne (1995), Leybourne et al. (1996), Distaso

(2008) and Nagakura (2009). Indeed, such approaches are not fully clear about Xt being stationary

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

or not, since a STUR process may well be strictly stationary (we refer to Yoon, 2006 for an insightful

discussion). The case of a stochastic unit root is of great interest, since it is a marked departure from

the usual deterministic unit root case. Indeed, whilst the unit root hypothesis may often hold for

several series, nonstationarity itself may not; in this respect, the literature has explored, especially in

the context of ﬁnancial data, the notion of “volatility induced stationarity”, where a series may have

a unit root, but its variance grows to inﬁnity so as to compensate the deviations from the mean (see

Nielsen and Rahbek, 2014 and Kanaya, 2011). There are several reasons why it would be useful to

ﬁnd out whether Xt is stationary and ergodic or not: estimating the variance of the error term et is

possible only under stationarity; further, in order to recover standard normal inference when Xt is

nonstationary through e.g. the QML estimator discussed in Aue and Horv´ath (2011), it is required

that bt is not equal to zero almost surely, otherwise the standard OLS estimator has a faster rate

of convergence (Wang and Yu, 2015). Although there is a plethora of tests for a unit root in the

AR(1) case, to the best of our knowledge there are no contributions which have a suﬃcient amount

of generality to be applicable to the context of AR(1) and RCAR(1) models. In addition to this, even

in the AR(1) case, testing procedures usually require the existence of at least the ﬁrst two moments;

tests for a unit root in presence of inﬁnite variance have been studied (Phillips, 1990), but their

implementation usually requires using a diﬀerent limiting distribution (and, consequently, diﬀerent

critical values) - note however that, in a related contribution, Cavaliere et al. (2016) provide a solution

by using the bootstrap, but their results do not cover the RCAR case and it is not immediately clear

how to generalise the bootstrap to the RCAR model under general conditions (see Fink and Kreiss,

2013).

Such a lack of procedures to check for the (strict) stationarity of an RCAR model is undesirable, in

the light of the empirical potential of this family of models. Indeed, the literature has developed a

fair amount of tests for stationarity (either as the null, or, perhaps more frequently, the alternative

hypothesis) in various contexts. There are, as is well-known, many contributions for the unit root

problem in the case of a linear model (such as the AR(1), which as noted above is nested in the

RCAR set-up), but there are also quite a few contributions for more general frameworks. For example,

Kapetanios (2007), Lima and Neri (2013) and Busetti and Harvey (2010) propose tests for the null of

stationarity by using quantile-based techniques, thus not needing to specify a model for the data. In

addition, there are also several tests that deal with speciﬁc nonlinear models, such as TAR (Tsay, 1997,

Caner and Hansen, 2001), STAR (Kapetanios et al., 2003) and ESTAR (Kılı¸c, 2011). In particular,

building on the notion of top Lyapunov exponent, Guo et al. (2016) propose a test for the null of

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

4

strict stationarity in the context of a DAR model; see also Shintani and Linton (2004), and Ling

(2004) and Francq and Zako¨ıan (2012). However, all the contributions cited above have, in common,

the assumption that some moments of the distribution of the data (typically, the variance) need to

exist.

This paper extends the literature in at least three directions. Firstly, as mentioned above, contribu-

tions on testing for the stationarity of the RCAR model are rare; furthermore, the existing exceptions

(e.g. Zhao and Wang, 2012) typically require moment restrictions such as having ﬁnite variance. Fur-

thermore, our test, which is constructed for the null of (strict) stationarity in the RCAR framework,

can also be applied to the case of an AR(1) model with no modiﬁcations and no need to test for

genuine randomness in (1.1). Indeed, even though in the main part of the paper we consider the con-

struction of a test for stationarity without having any deterministics in (1.1), as is typical in the case

of inﬁnite variance, we also consider extensions to include these: our test can be applied without any

pre-treatment of the data in the presence of bounded deterministics (including constant and piecewise

constant functions) and, subject to detrending, to the case of trends. We also propose, as a by-product,

a test for the null of non-stationarity with the same level of generality as discussed above. Finally,

our test can be applied in the presence of inﬁnite variance and even inﬁnite mean (indeed, all that is

required is the existence of some moments, i.e. E

again, the test does not require any prior knowledge as to the existence of moments, and it can be

applied directly with no modiﬁcations (even in this case, irrespective of having an RCAR or an AR(1)

model). Having a test which can be readily applied in the presence of heavy tails with no need to

estimate nuisance parameters is arguably useful in empirical applications: data with inﬁnite variance

(or even inﬁnite mean) could occur in applications to ﬁnance and also to other disciplines - we refer

to the textbook by Embrechts et al. (2013) for details and discussed examples. An important feature

of several inferential procedures is that they rely on the estimation of the so-called “tail index”, which

characterizes the largest existing moment of a random variable: this parameter is however notoriously

diﬃcult to estimate (see Embrechts et al., 2013). Note also that, since we allow for E

2 =

Xt|

|

, our

∞

focus is on strict, as opposed to weak, stationarity.

From a technical point of view, we construct a scale-invariant statistic which diverges to positive

inﬁnity under the null of stationarity, and drifts to zero at a polynomial rate under the alternative

hypothesis, in all possible circumstances. In the context of a non-linear model like the RCAR (also

with the possibility of having inﬁnite variance or even inﬁnite mean) it is not easy to construct a

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

5

statistic which converges to a unique and “easy” limiting distribution: hence, we do not derive any

distributional limit for our test statistic, only rates of convergence/divergence. Given that our proposed

statistic does not have a usable limiting distribution, we propose to randomise it, in a similar spirit

to Corradi and Swanson (2006) and Bandi and Corradi (2014). The test can then be employed as is;

however, given that it is a randomised test whose outcome depends on the auxiliary randomisation,

we complement our methodology by also proposing a strong decision rule which is independent of the

randomisation, thereby giving the same outcome to diﬀerent users.

The paper is organised as follows. The main assumptions, the test statistic, and the asymptotics, are

all in Section 2. In Section 3 we report extensions to: including deterministics, testing for the null

of non-stationarity, and developing a family of related statistics. Monte Carlo evidence is reported in

Section 4, where we also carry out an empirical application to illustrate the use of our procedure and

in particular of the proposed strong decision rule. Section 5 concludes. Technical results and all proofs

are in Appendix.

NOTATION We use “

C0, C1,... denote positive and ﬁnite constants that do not depend on the sample size (unless otherwise

stated), and whose value may change from line to line; IA (x) is the indicator function of a set A;

strictly positive, arbitrarily small constants are denoted as ǫ - again, the value of ǫ may change from

line to line. Finally, since all results in the paper hold almost surely, orders of magnitude for an a.s.

convergent sequence (say sT ) are denoted as O (T ς) and o (T ς) when, for some ǫ > 0 and ˜T <

This section contains all the relevant theory. In Section 2.1 we spell out the necessary and suﬃcient

conditions required for strict stationarity, and discuss under which circumstances the second moment

of Xt is ﬁnite. Assumptions are in Section 2.2, and the test statistic is reported in Section 2.3.

It is well known that, under minimal assumptions such as the existence of logarithmic moments for e0

and ϕ + b0, three separate regimes can hold for the solutions of (1.1), depending on the value taken

by E ln

(2.1)

Note that, when Eb2

0 > 0, E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

can be negative even when ϕ = 1: thus, the STUR process can

converge to a strictly stationary solution, although in such a case ¯Xt has an inﬁnite second moment
(see Hwang and Basawa, 2005). More generally, the variance of ¯Xt needs not be ﬁnite under strict

stationarity; a necessary and suﬃcient condition for this is Eb2

0 + ϕ2 < 1 (Quinn, 1982).

(ii) If E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

> 0, then Xt is nonstationary and it exhibits an explosive behaviour. This case has

also been studied in depth by the literature: Berkes et al. (2009) show that

Xt| → ∞

fast.

Xt|

= 0, Xt is nonstationary (see also the comments after As-

diverges, but at a slower rate than exponential. This case has been

paid comparatively less attention in the literature.

Clearly, this classiﬁcation also holds for the basic AR(1) model, i.e. for the case b0 = 0 a.s.

On the grounds of the classiﬁcation above, we propose a procedure to decide between

HA : Xt is nonstationary

2.2. Assumptions

We now introduce and discuss the main assumptions. The ﬁrst assumption must be satisﬁed by Xt

irrespective of the regime it belongs to, and it can be compared to the assumptions in Aue et al.

(2006).

Assumption 1. It holds that: (i)

Assumption 1 contains minimal requirements as far as the existence of moments is concerned, and, in

this respect, it is very general. Note that by part (iv) of the assumption, we require that, when the

mean of et and bt exists, this is zero. As far as the i.i.d. requirement for et and bt is concerned, it is

typical in this literature (see Aue et al., 2006), and it is imposed only in order for the main arguments

in the proofs not to be overshadowed by technical details. Indeed, relaxing the assumption of indepen-

dence is possible: the conditions for stationarity mentioned above hold as long as

et, bt}
{

is strictly

stationary and ergodic (see Theorem 4.1 in Douc et al., 2014) as well as having logarithmic moments.

Also, the technical arguments used in the paper (essentially, the ergodic theorem, the SLLN, and the

almost sure Invariance Principle) can all be extended to the case of weakly dependent data. A major

advantage of our approach, in this case, is that our test statistic is based only on rates and therefore,

even in the presence of dependence, our test statistic would not require any modiﬁcations such as, for

example, the estimation of long run variance matrices.

Stationary units must also satisfy the following assumption.

Assumption 2. If E ln

ϕ + b0|

< 0, it holds that (i) P

¯X0|

= 0

< 1; (ii) P (
|

e0|

= 0) < 1.

|
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Assumption 2 is also quite standard in the literature. Part (i) is, in essence, a non degeneracy re-

quirement; as far as part (ii) is concerned, its most immediate consequence is that, under the other

assumptions in this paper, the condition E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

< 0 is necessary and suﬃcient for strict station-

arity - see Aue et al. (2006).

When Xt is non-stationary, we need the following assumptions in addition to Assumption 1.

Assumption 3. If E ln

ϕ + b0| ≥

0, it holds that: (i) e0 has bounded density; (ii) when P (b0 = 0) < 1,

Assumption 3 is relatively common in this literature (see e.g. Berkes et al., 2009). The main part of

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

8

the assumption is part (ii), which poses a moment restriction on ln

: asymptotics is based on

|
; note that this is not, therefore, a requirement on the existence of

ϕ + b0|

this quantity rather than on

ϕ + b0|

|

e.g. the second moment of b0. Assumption 4 deals with the standard unit root case, where ϕ = 1 and

b0 = 0 a.s.; all other cases are covered by Assumption 3. Part (ii) of the assumption, in particular,

allows for inﬁnite variance, and indeed only requires minimal moment existence conditions - all that

is needed is that the tail index, γ, be strictly positive, so that the variance, and even the ﬁrst absolute

moment, need not be ﬁnite. Note that we do not need to estimate γ at any stage of the proposed testing

procedure. The requirements on the tail behaviour of the distribution function are rather standard in

the literature (Berkes et al., 1986; Berkes and Dehling, 1989). Some of the technical results derived

under this assumption are of general interest, such as the anti-concentration bound in Lemma 8.

2.3. Detecting strict stationarity

We start by discussing the rationale underpinning the construction of the test statistic. In the light

of the comments above,

Xt| → ∞

|

or not according as Xt is non-stationary or stationary: this holds

under quite general circumstances, e.g. whether bt = 0 or not, or whether E

2 <

Xt|

|

∞

or not. Thus, it

could be possible to exploit this fact to decide between H0 and HA. Heuristically, a possible indicator

could be based on

ϕXt−1 and It−1 is the information set available up to t

1 - (2.3) represents the (condi-

−

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

rate of variances has already been considered (see e.g. Cai and Shintani, 2006, Bandi and Corradi,

2014, Corradi, 1999). Albeit natural, this approach suﬀers from several drawbacks: Eb2

0 and/or Ee2
0

may not exist (thus limiting the applicability of the test); or Eb2

0 could be zero, which would prevent

the test from being applied to genuine AR (1) speciﬁcations; ﬁnally, approaches based on (2.3) may re-

quire estimates of Eb2

0 and Ee2

0, with the latter not being always consistent (see Horv´ath and Trapani,

2017). In order to overcome all these diﬃculties, one could instead think of using the transformation

Yt =

a
a + X 2
t

,

where 0 < a <

∞

is chosen so as to ensure scale invariance. Heuristically, since a > 0, Yt should not

be equal to 0 when Xt is stationary; conversely, since a <

, when Xt is nonstationary, Yt should

∞

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

9

drift to 0. The variable Yt is not aﬀected by Xt having inﬁnite variance or inﬁnite mean, since all

moments of Yt exist by construction. Also, in the deﬁnition of Yt there is no dependence on Eb2

0: thus,

Yt uses the full force of Xt when this diverges, even in the presence of a genuine AR (1) speciﬁcation

for which bt = 0. Finally, upon choosing a in a suitable way, no estimation of Eb2

0 or Ee2

0 is required,

making the problem much more tractable. We build on these considerations in order to propose a test

for the strict stationarity of Xt, based on the following scale-invariant transformation

DT =

1

−

p

T

T

t=p+1
X

vp
vp + X 2
t

,

(2.4)

where vp = p−1

p
t=1 X 2

t can be viewed as a sample second moment (or, if using demeaned data, a

sample variance). We point out that, as shown in the remainder of the paper, vp can still be used even

P

when the second moment of Xt is not ﬁnite. Based on the heuristic considerations above, DT should

converge to a strictly positive number under stationarity, and to zero otherwise. As a ﬁnal, ancillary

comment, we note that a related quantity to DT is used in the context of the estimation of ϕ - see

Janeˇckov´a and Pr´aˇskov´a (2004).

The computation of vp should satisfy the following assumption:

Assumption 5. It holds that p = p (T ) with: (i) limT →∞ p (T ) =

The rates of convergence are summarised in the following theorem.

- in the latter case, C0 = 1. However, for the purpose of the

implementation of the test, it suﬃces to have C0 > 0. The result in (2.6) means that, under nonsta-

tionarity, DT drifts to zero. We do not know anything about the value of ǫ in general; however, on

account of (2.6), DT converges a.s. to zero at a polynomial rate.

Based on Theorem 1, we can propose a test for H0. Consider a sequence ψ (T ) such that, as T

Thus, ψ (T ) DT diverges to positive inﬁnity under the null, whereas it drifts to zero under the alterna-

tive. Equations (2.8)-(2.9) suggest that ψ (T ) DT can be a suitable diagnostic to discriminate between

and consequently we can assume that limT →∞ lT =

account of (2.7), ψ (T ) may not be allowed to diverge too fast; ψ (T ) = (ln T )β, for some β > 0, is a

possible choice. However, depending on the choice of the function g (

to diverge arbitrarily fast.

Our test is based on a randomised version of lT . We propose a “classical” randomisation scheme, which

has been employed in the literature - we refer to Corradi and Swanson (2006) and Bandi and Corradi

(2014) inter alia. Of course, other schemes are also possible.

Theorem 2 provides the limiting behaviour of the test statistic ΘR,T under the null and under the

alternative. The results are derived conditional on the sample, and they hold for all possible realisa-

tions, apart from a set of measure zero. Considering (2.16), note that the drift term is maximised for

G (0) = F (0) = 1

The theorem illustrates how the choice of R impacts on the behaviour of ΘR,T . On the one hand,

one should choose R as large as possible, in order to maximise the rate of divergence of ΘR,T under

the alternative - this is evident from (2.16). On the other hand, the test statistic has a non-centrality

parameter which grows with R, under the null: this is illustrated by (2.14). Consequently, R should

not be too large, in order to avoid size distortion.

2.3.1. Deciding between H0 and HA

Testing using ΘR,T is, in essence, based on checking a rate of convergence, and it is therefore very

similar to the idea in Bandi and Corradi (2014) - we also refer to a contribution by Kanaya (2011)

for a discussion. In principle (although, possibly, with some interpretational diﬃculties related to

having a null hypothesis spelt out in terms of a rate of divergence), the test can be employed as it

is, and its main properties (size and power) are reported in (2.17) and (2.18). Based on the latter

equation, the test rejects the null with probability one when false, thus being consistent. Conversely,

the meaning of (2.17) is non-standard. The randomness in ΘR,T is added by the researcher, and indeed

it is the only randomness present in the statistic: such randomness does not vanish asymptotically.

Thus, diﬀerent researchers using the same dataset will obtain diﬀerent p-values; indeed, if an inﬁnite

number of researchers apply the test to the same data (and the null holds), the resulting p-values will

be uniformly distributed on [0, 1].

This is a well-known feature of randomised tests, and it may be viewed as an undesirable issue,

which may explain their relative infrequent use - see the discussion and the solutions proposed in

the contribution by Geyer and Meeden (2005). We build on the notion of “randomised conﬁdence

function”, proposed by Song (2016), in order to propose a strong rule to decide between H0 and

HA, whose outcome is the same for all researchers using the same dataset. In order to remove the

randomness from the test statistic, each researcher, instead of computing ΘR,T just once, will compute

the test statistic S times using, at each iteration s, an independent sequence

and 1

in our context, Q (α) is the randomised conﬁdence function proposed by Song (2016), computed under

the null. Intuitively, based on Theorem 2, Q (α) should converge to 1

α under H0, and to 0 under

−

HA. This dichotomous behaviour is not subject to the randomness added by the researcher (which is

washed away as S

), and it could be employed to construct a decision rule based on the Law of

The rule in (2.20) is similar to the rule proposed by Corradi (1999), who proposes a bound to discern

between I (0) and I (1) - related contributions, where criteria are proposed in the context of choosing

between I (0) and I (1), have also been developed by Stock (1994), Phillips and Ploberger (1994) and

Phillips and Ploberger (1996). A typical advantage of this approach is that, at least asymptotically, it

yields a probability zero of having both a Type I error and a Type II error, as (2.22) and (2.23) show.

In addition to this, as far as our context is concerned, we note that, based on Corollary 1, under H0

each researcher will make the same decision (“accept”), with no discrepancies among researchers and

probability one of being correct, and similarly under HA.

3. Discussion and extensions

In this section, we discuss possible extensions and generalisations of the basic test statistic. We consider

three possible generalisations: (a) the case of deterministics being present in (1.1); (b) the construction

of a test for the null of non-stationarity; and ﬁnally, (c) the construction of diﬀerent, but related test

statistics. All results are shown in appendix when necessary; the proofs of some results however follow

readily from the existing proofs, and thus, when possible, we omit the details.

3.1. Employing the test in the presence of deterministics

So far, we have assumed no deterministics in (1.1). This is common in this literature, when heavy tails

are considered, and we also refer to the comments in Cavaliere et al. (2016). In this section, we show

that it is possible to consider an extension to incorporate deterministics in (1.1). We assume that the

observed data - say X ∗

t - are generated as

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

X ∗

t = dt + Xt,

14

(3.1)

where Xt is deﬁned as in (1.1). There are two types of deterministic processes dt. In the case of square

integrable dt, viz.

lim
T →∞

1

T

t=1
X

2 <

dt|

|

,
∞

(3.2)

we show that the test can be used with no modiﬁcations. Condition (3.2) includes several possible

cases: dt can be constant; it can be piecewise constant, thus allowing for shifts in the mean; or it could

be a weighted average of sines and cosines, which could be useful to model seasonalities and, in general,

smooth, bounded processes (see Enders and Lee, 2012). In all these cases, and indeed whenever (3.2)

is satisﬁed, the test can be applied directly, with no modiﬁcations or prior knowledge of the nature of

dt.

It is also possible to apply the test in the presence of trends, and in general when (3.2) does not hold.

In this case, it is necessary to detrend the data ﬁrst, by estimating dt via, say,

dt. The test statistic

DT is modiﬁed as

it essentially requires that

dt be a consistent estimator of the (trend) function dt. Although several

choices are possible, we refer to the contribution by Peng and Yao (2004) on the estimation of trend

functions in the presence of heavy tails, where MSE consistency is still ensured; note that we do not

need ǫ1 to be any special value, as long as the MSE drifts to zero at a polynomial rate. Part (ii)

strengthens Assumption 2, and it is again a non-degeneracy condition.

It holds that

Theorem 3. Under Assumptions 1-5 and 7, equations (2.5) and (2.6) hold.

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

15

Theorem 3 entails that D∗

T can be used in the same way as DT , obtaining the same results for the

corresponding test (under the same assumptions), and it can be generalised as we do with DT in the

next sections.

3.2. Testing for the null of non-stationarity

In the spirit of the KPSS test (see Kwiatkowski et al., 1992; see also the contribution by Giraitis et al.,

2006), and of other constributions in the context of nonlinear models (see e.g. Kapetanios, 2007), all

the results developed so far are based on the hypothesis testing framework set out in (2.2), where H0 :

Xt is strictly stationary.

However, a test for

H ∗

0 : Xt is nonstationary




H ∗

A : Xt is strictly stationary

(3.3)

can be readily derived from the theory developed above.



Our testing approach requires having a test statistic which diverges under the null, whilst being

bounded under the alternative. On account of (2.8) and (2.9), one could use

1
ψ (T ) DT (cid:19)
where ψ (T ) is deﬁned in (2.7); by continuity, it follows that

from which a test, based on a randomised version of l∗

as proposed above, we would obtain a test statistic denoted by Θ∗

As for ΘR,T , (3.5) provides a selection rule for R. If, as suggested in the next section, one were to
1 - and ψ (T ) = (ln T )β, as recommended above - then setting R = T would

choose g (x) = exp (x)

−

satisfy (3.5). Finally, note that instead of Xt the same arguments could be applied to Yt.

3.3. Modiﬁcations of the test statistic

Heuristically, our test statistic is based on studying the variance of ut = et + btXt−1 in

Xt = ϕXt−1 + ut.

The main intuition is that under stationarity E

It−1

u2
t |

should be bounded as t elapses, whereas it

grows as t

→ ∞

when Xt is nonstationary. Owing to the reasons discussed at the beginning of Section

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

2.3, the testing procedure uses a modiﬁed statistic, rather than E

u2
t |

It−1

directly.

In a similar vein, one use diﬀerent moments of the error term ut, say E (

(cid:0)

ς

(cid:1)
ut|

|

|

It−1) for some ς > 0: it

can be expected that the stationarity/nonstationarity of Xt will still entail the convergence/divergence

It−1). From a technical point of view, our arguments and our proofs diﬀer depending on

or not, and therefore it can be envisaged that, if relying upon E (

or not - but apart from this, the ﬁnal results will be the

ς . The following result is reported without proof.

Theorem 5. Under Assumptions 1-5, equations (2.5) and (2.6) hold.

P

Theorem 5 entails that DT (ς) has the same properties as DT , and it can therefore be used, and

generalised, in the same way. Indeed, upon making sure that the artiﬁcial samples used in the various

randomisations are generated independently, it would even be possible to run a meta-test by trying

several values of ς and combining the outcomes e.g. according to Fisher’s method. As before, the same

ideas could be applied to Yt. Although this extension is theoretically possible, unreported simulations

show that ς = 2 aﬀords the best results; choosing ς < 2 makes tests very conservative (e.g. when ς = 1

the power is cut by two thirds), whereas ς > 2 results in the opposite problem.

4. Simulations and empirical illustration

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

17

This section contains two separate contributions. In Section 4.1 we report some evidence from synthetic

data on the empirical rejection frequencies of our test in order to assess size and power; we analyse the

performance of decision rules based on Dα,S; and we discuss possible guidelines for the implementation

of the test statistic. In Section 4.2, we illustrate our approach, and in particular the use of Dα,S,

through an application to several US macro aggregates.

4.1. Monte Carlo evidence

The design of the reported experiments is as follows.

We use (1.1) as a DGP; bt is generated as i.i.d. N

0, σ2
b

, with σ2

0, 0.1, 0.25

b ∈ {

in order to consider

}

(cid:0)
the genuine AR case as well as cases with random coeﬃcients. According to the theory, it would also

(cid:1)

be possible to consider a heavy tailed distribution for bt; we noticed through few trials that doing

this does not change results in a decisive way. We report results for three diﬀerent speciﬁcations of

et: i.i.d. N

0, σ2
e

, i.i.d. t2 and i.i.d. t1, where tk denotes a Student t distribution with k degrees of

freedom, so as to consider the cases of inﬁnite variance and inﬁnite mean. In the Gaussian case, we

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

have used σ2

e = 1; we note however that the test is completely insensitive to the value of σ2

e , which

suggests that the use of vp is very eﬀective at ensuring scale invariance.

We have used ϕ

; larger values of ϕ, for the nonstationary cases, could also
0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 1, 1.05
}

∈ {

be considered but in those cases - as can be expected - the test has unit power even for very small

samples.

The various combinations

ϕ, σ2
b

deserve attention. All cases where ϕ

0.95 entail that Xt is

≤

stationary: the corresponding empirical rejection frequencies represent the size of the test. Also, upon

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

computing the value of E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

, it can be noted that the two cases

ϕ, σ2
b

1, 0.1

=

{

}

and

ϕ, σ2
b

=

1, 0.25
{

}

correspond to a stationary STUR; even in these cases the empirical rejection

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

(cid:8)
frequencies represent the size, and it should be noted that, when Xt is a (stationary) STUR process,

(cid:9)

it has inﬁnite variance irrespective of the distributions of bt and et. Finally, again upon computing

E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

, it turns out that the case

ϕ, σ2
b

1.05, 0.25

=

{

}

again with inﬁnite variance.

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

is also an instance of Xt being stationary,

Thus, the nonstationary cases considered in our experiment are a pure explosive case corresponding

to

ϕ, σ2
b

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

=

{

1.05, 0

, and the pure unit root case
}

ϕ, σ2
b

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

=

1, 0
{

. In the latter case, clearly
}

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

18

E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

= 0 and therefore Xt is on the cusp between explosive and strictly stationary behaviour -

note that we are considering, by virtue of the several possible distributions of et, also cases of random

walk with inﬁnite variance and mean, in a similar spirit to Cavaliere et al. (2016). However, in our

case the null is stationarity, not unit root, and therefore the empirical rejection frequencies represent

the power of our test. Finally, we point out that the case

ϕ, σ2
b

1.05, 0.1

=

{

}

is of particular interest

because E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

= 3.3

×

10−3 - that is, it is positive (and, therefore, Xt is nonstationary) but

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

very small. Finally, in a separate experiment (the outcomes are in Tables 2 and 4), we have considered

several combinations of

ϕ, σ2
b

for which E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

in those cases.

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

= 0, so as to evaluate the behaviour of the test

We now turn to describing the speciﬁcations of the test; as a general note, their impact vanishes for

large samples. Our reported experiments are based on the following choices, which delivered the best

results and are thus recommended as guidelines to the applied user. We choose:

ψ (T ) = (ln T )5/4 ,

g (x) = exp (exp (x)

1)

1;

−

−

(4.1)

(4.2)

the choices in (4.1) and (4.2) are designed in order to ensure that g (ψ (T ) DT )

exp (T ) under H0,

≍

and that g (ψ (T ) DT ) drifts to zero as T

→ ∞

under HA. Thus, the double exponential in (4.2)

serves the purpose of “divaricating” as much as possible the case where ψ (T ) DT diverges from the

case where it does not; other choices would also be possible, but (4.1) and (4.2) work well in all

cases considered. Based on (2.14), we set R = T . Finally, by Assumption 5, in the computation of

vp (which we carry out with demeaned data), we need to choose p = C0 ln ln T for some C0, which

implies that p does not vary too much as T increases. We have used C0 = 2, rounding C0 ln ln T to

the nearest, largest integer; varying p around this number does not aﬀect the results anyway. Finally,

we have implemented the decision rule based on Dα,S using S = 1000; we note that increasing this

number results in better outcomes, at the (obvious) cost of a higher computational burden. Under

each scenario, we compute the percentage of times that the decision rule is in favour of H0, using this

as a measure of performance.

We generate

T

case, the results are broadly similar for diﬀerent distributions of et. As a conclusion, the test seems to

test is also powerful in the purely explosive case

As mentioned above, we have also considered a broader set of cases where Xt is nonstationary, in which

E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

= 0. The power of our test versus these alternatives is in Table 2; the test has very good

power in all cases considered, the only possible exception being the case with normally distributed

errors and T = 250, but even in that case the power picks up for larger T . Note the major increase in

power when the error term et has a Student t distribution; this does not seem to be sensitive to the

degrees of freedom of the distribution. Note also the excellent performance of Dα,S for large T .

We have also considered, based on the discussion in Section 3.2, testing for H0 : Xt is nonstationary.

For brevity, we did not experiment with Dα,S; otherwise, the design of the simulations, and the

speciﬁcation of the test statistic, are carried out exactly as in the previous case. As suggested in

Section 3.2, we use

The test has the correct size in all cases considered. The power versus stationarity is strong when Xt

is “very stationary” - i.e. when ϕ = 0 or 0.5, and it is anyway above 50% in the “less stationary” case

of having ϕ = 0.95 when T

500. Similarly, Table 4 shows that the test has the correct size even

in the nonstationary, but boundary, case E ln

= 0. We note that, in all cases considered, the

distribution of et does not seem to play a role on the ﬁnal results.

4.2. Empirical illustration

The purpose of this section is primarily to illustrate the use of Q (α) and of the decision rule based on

Dα,S. We apply our procedure to several US macroeconomic aggregates (similarly to Hill and Peng,

2014). We consider the logs of: real GDP, M2 (as a measure of the aggregate money supply), CPI

(and we also consider inﬂation, deﬁned as the log-diﬀerence of CPI), and the Industrial Production

index. We also apply our methodology to the (untransformed) rate of unemployment. Finally, we also

consider the 3-months T-bill, inspired by the contribution by Nielsen and Rahbek (2014).

The decision rule (2.20) is applied in order to choose between

H0 : Xt is strictly stationary




HA : Xt is nonstationary

As a further illustration, we apply the test to ﬁrst-diﬀerenced data, in the cases where a series is found



to be nonstationary. Finally, we also use (2.20) to decide between

H0 : Xt is nonstationary




again considering data in levels and (if need be) in ﬁrst diﬀerence. As far as the implementation is



concerned, a note on deterministics is in order. We know from Section 3.1 that our test can, in general,

be applied to non-zero mean data; the test can also be applied in the presence of trends (albeit only

after detrending), which should make our procedure particularly suitable for macroeconomic aggre-

gates. There has been much debate on the presence (or absence) of a linear trend in macroeconomic

aggregates, and, in general, as to whether macroeconomic series are better characterised as having a

linear trend or a unit root (the so-called “uncertain unit root”). Starting at least from the seminal

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

21

paper by Nelson and Plosser (1982), various contributions have questioned whether such series ought

to be modelled as having a unit root or a linear trend. GDP is a prime example of this debate, and it

has been the subject of several studies: we refer to the classical paper by Rudebusch (1993), and also

to Murray and Nelson (2000) and the extensive literature review therein. Similarly, some studies seem

to suggest that trends may be present in the CPI (see Beechey and ¨Osterholm, 2008), and that money

aggregates also may have trends (Brand, Gerdesmeier, and Roﬃa, Brand et al.). Whilst the empirical

exercise in this paper is not aimed at addressing the “uncertain unit root” debate in a comprehensive

way, we have taken this literature into account by detrending all the series using the GLS detrending

scheme proposed in Elliot et al. (1996).

[Insert Table 5 somewhere here]

In the computation of (2.20), we have used Q (0.05), setting S = 5000. We have used the same

speciﬁcations as described in the previous section, namely: R = T ; p = 5; ψ (T ) = (ln T )5/4; g (x) =

1)

exp (exp (x)

1; and we compute vp using demeaned data. In Table 6, we also report the estimated

−
values of ϕ and σ2
b computed using the WLS estimator studied in Horv´ath and Trapani (2017). Based

−

on (2.20), and on the fact that α = 0.05 and S = 5000, the decision rule is based on not rejecting H0

whenever

Q (0.05)

rejecting otherwise. Results are reported in Table 6, where we have also reported, for illustration pur-

poses, the outcomes of the unit root test by Elliot et al. (1996) and of the KPSS test (see Kwiatkowski et al.,

1992), which we have carried out for those series which do not have a random autoregressive root.

[Insert Table 6 somewhere here]

As a preliminary comment, based on the test for no randomness (H0 : σ2

b = 0) developed by

Horv´ath and Trapani (2017), two series (Industrial Production and unemployment) are found to have

a random autoregressive root, whereas the others do not. We have (very) heuristically checked these

two series, by calculating the value of E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

, using

ϕ as face value and assuming that b0 is

Gaussian; in both cases, E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

turns out to be very close to zero. As far as testing for stationar-

b

ity is concerned, results are quite clear-cut: all series are found to be nonstationary. This is perfectly

L. Trapani/Testing for stationarity

22

in line with the ﬁndings from applying the other unit root tests reported in the table - although of

course these can only be applied to the series with a deterministic autoregressive root. Interestingly,

all series become stationary after ﬁrst diﬀerencing: this cannot be taken for granted, since some series

have a random autoregressive coeﬃcient and therefore there is no guarantee that ﬁrst diﬀerencing

may induce stationarity - see Leybourne et al. (1996). Exactly the same pattern of results is found

when swapping the null and the alternative hypotheses.

Finally, we note that, as a robustness check, we have experimented with diﬀerent speciﬁcations for

our procedure - e.g. varying R from T /2 to 2T ; increasing p to 4 ln ln T ; and trying S = 1000 and

S = 10000. In all these cases, we noted that results were entirely unchanged compared to the ones

in Table 6, suggesting that the strong rule based on (2.20) is quite robust to diﬀerent choices of

user-deﬁned parameters.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we have developed a test for the null of strict stationarity applied to a RCAR(1) model.

Our testing approach can be applied to a wide variety of situations, without requiring any modiﬁcation

or any prior knowledge. Chieﬂy, the test is still usable if the autoregressive root is not random, i.e. in

the case of an AR(1) speciﬁcation. Also, the test does not require (neither as assumptions, nor for the

purpose of the actual implementation) the existence of the variance of Xt, or of virtually any moment.

Finally, the test can be applied in the presence of deterministics: even in this case (with the exception

of having trends), the implementation of the test does not require any prior analysis. To the best of

our knowledge, no existing test has such a level of generality.

Technically, the test is based on the (almost sure) limiting behaviour of a statistic which either diverges

to positive inﬁnity or drifts to zero without having any randomness, we propose to use it as part of

a randomisation procedure. Numerical evidence shows that the test performs very well, also showing

very promising results in the cases where Xt is borderline between being stationary and non-stationary

- that is, in cases where E ln

ϕ + b0|

|

is either positive or negative, but “small”.

6. Technical Lemmas

The ﬁrst few lemmas are for the case E ln

ϕ + b0|

< 0. The ﬁrst lemma is an immediate consequence

of Assumption 2, and we therefore report it without proof.

Using Lemmas 7 and 8, the desired result follows.

Proof of Theorem 2. The proof, and in particular condition (2.14), are a reﬁnement of similar results

in related papers, such as Bandi and Corradi (2014) and Horv´ath and Trapani (2017). We begin by

considering equation (2.15); in this case, (2.5) entails lT = g (C0ψ (T )) a.s., so that, by (2.10), we can

assume from now on that limT →∞ lT =

Table 6. Outcomes of estimation and testing for the null of strict stationarity. We have also reported the WLS estimators

of ϕ and of σ2

b (

ϕ and

b ), as studied in Horv´ath and Trapani (2017); the symbol “(∗)” next to the values of
σ2

σ2
b denotes

rejection of the null of no coeﬃcient randomness expressed as H0 : σ2

b = 0 (we refer to ? for the theory of estimation and

b

b

b

the test). As mentioned in the paper, we have computed two popular unit root tests: the Elliot-Rothenberg-Stock test

(reported in the column ERS) and the KPSS test. The former has been carried out under the hypothesis of a constant

and a trend, using the Bartlett kernel to estimate the spectral density and choosing the related bandwidth via the criteria

discussed in Andrews (1991). The same speciﬁcations were used for the KPSS test. In the last four columns, we have

reported the values of Q (α) (for α = 0.05) for the data in levels and ﬁrst diﬀerences, considering both testing for the

null of stationarity and the null of nonstationarity. In all tests considered, the symbol “(∗)” indicates rejection of the null

hypothesis.
