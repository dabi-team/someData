Abstract: 

The Carrington event is considered to be one of the most extreme space weather events 

in observational history within a series of magnetic storms caused by extreme 

interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from a large and complex active region 

(AR) emerged on the solar disk. In this article, we study the temporal and spatial 

evolutions of the source sunspot active region and visual aurorae, and compare this 

storm with other extreme space weather events on the basis of their spatial evolution. 

Sunspot drawings by Schwabe, Secchi, and Carrington describe the position and 

morphology of the source AR at that time. Visual auroral reports from the Russian 

Empire, Iberia, Ireland, Oceania, and Japan fill the spatial gap of auroral visibility and 

revise the time series of auroral visibility in mid to low magnetic latitudes (MLATs). 

The reconstructed time series is compared with magnetic measurements and shows the 

correspondence between low to mid latitude aurorae and the phase of magnetic storms. 

The spatial evolution of the auroral oval is compared with those of other extreme space 

weather events in 1872, 1909, 1921, and 1989 as well as their storm intensity, and 

contextualizes the Carrington event, as one of the most extreme space weather events, 

but likely not unique.

evolution. We have compared the available sunspot drawings to reconstruct the 

morphology and evolution of sunspot groups at that time. We have surveyed visual 

auroral reports in the Russian Empire, Ireland, Iberian Peninsula, Oceania, and Japan, 

and fill the spatial gap of auroral visibility and revised its time series. We have 

compared this time series with magnetic measurements and shown the correspondence 

between low to mid latitude aurorae and the phase of magnetic storms. We have 

compared the spatial evolution of the auroral oval with those of other extreme space 

weather events in 1872, 1909, 1921, and 1989 as well as their storm intensity, and 

concluded that the Carrington event is one of the most extreme space weather events, 

but is likely not unique.  

Key Points 

1) Original sunspot drawings during the 1859 storms are revealed and analyzed 

2) New auroral reports from Eurasia and Oceania fill the spatial and temporal gaps of 

the auroral visibility during the 1859 storms 

3) The 1859 storms are compared and contextualized with the other extreme space 

weather events 

1. Introduction: 

After the earliest datable observation of a white-light flare in a large sunspot group by 

Carrington (1859) and Hodgson (1859) on 1859 September 1, humanity experienced 

one of the most extreme magnetic storms in observational history (Tsurutani et al., 2003; 

Cliver and Dietrich, 2013). The reported white-light solar flare was followed by a 

sudden ionospheric disturbance, namely a large magnetic crochet ≈ 110 nT (Stewart, 

1861; Boteler, 2006), which suggests the flare intensity as ≈ X45 – one of the largest in 

observational history and comparable to the largest modern flare on 2003 November 4 

(Boteler, 2006; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013; Curto et al., 2016; c.f., Thomson et al., 2004).  

   The Carrington event has been thus considered a benchmark of extreme space weather 

events in terms of its sudden ionospheric disturbance, solar energetic particle (SEP), 

solar wind velocity, magnetic disturbance, and equatorward boundary of auroral display 

(Cliver and Svalgaard, 2004). We note that recent discussions on the ice core data (e.g., 

Wolff et al., 2012; Usoskin and Kovaltsov, 2012; Schrijver et al., 2012; Mekhaldi et al., 

2018) made the existing estimate of its SEP fluence (e.g., McCracken et al., 2001; Shea 

3

Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

et al., 2006; Smart et al., 2006) rather controversial (Cliver and Dietrich, 2013; Usoskin, 

2017). 

   This great magnetic storm is characterized by an extreme negative magnetic excursion. 

For example, a value of ≈ −1600 nT was measured at Bombay (N18°56′, E072°50′) 

(Tsurutani et al., 2003). The anomalously short duration of the negative magnetic 

excursion has attracted much attention with regard to its cause in relation to the 

equatorward boundary of auroral visibility, ≈ 23° (Tsurutani et al., 2003) vs ≈ 18° 

(Green and Boardsen, 2006) in magnetic latitude (MLAT). The current source of the 

large-amplitude magnetic disturbance is also a matter of controversy. One possible 

source is the enhanced ring current (Tsurutani et al., 2003; Li et al., 2006; Keika et al., 

2015; c.f., Daglis et al., 1999), one is the auroral electrojet (Akasofu and Kamide, 2005; 

Green and Boardsen, 2006; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013), and another is field aligned 

current (Cid et al., 2015).  

   Another characteristic of this event was the great auroral displays down to mid- to 

low-magnetic latitudes (e.g., Green and Boardsen, 2006; Ribeiro et al., 2011; Hayakawa 

et al., 2018b; 2018c). The temporal and spatial evolution of auroral visibility was 

compared with the location of the magnetic record at Bombay by Green and Boardsen 

(2006). Their auroral records were concentrated in the western hemisphere. The 

equatorward boundary of the auroral oval reconstructed from the contemporary 

observational reports was as low as ≈ 28.5°/30.8° invariant latitude (ILAT) (Hayakawa 

et al., 2018b). Note that ILAT signifies a parameter for the magnetic field line, along 

which electron moves and cause auroral brightening (O’Brien et al., 1962; Hayakawa et 

al., 2018b). 

The auroral visibility around the Eurasian Continent remains largely unexamined, 

except for the records in Western Europe and East Asia (Green and Boardsen, 2006; 

Hayakawa et al., 2018b). Since the magnetic disturbances depend on magnetic local 

time, the simultaneous observations of the magnetic disturbances and the auroral 

visibilities provide a better understanding of the Carrington event. Thus, it is of 

significant interest to revise the temporal and spatial evolution of the auroral oval during 

the stormy interval around the Carrington event, on the basis of the uncovered 

contemporary observational reports around the Eurasian Continent, and compare them 

with the magnetic observations at the time.

Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

The survey on spatial evolution of auroral oval benefits comparison of intensity of 

extreme space weather events, due to the empirical correlation between equatorward 

boundary of auroral oval and storm intensity in Dst index (Yokoyama et al., 1998). 

While the Carrington event is certainly a benchmark, several space weather events such 

as those in 1872, 1909, and 1921, have been suggested as comparable in terms of 

equatorward boundary of auroral visibility (Chapman, 1957; Silverman and Cliver, 

2001; Silverman, 2006, 2008). Estimating the equatorward boundary of auroral ovals 

for these storms supports a feasible comparison of the Carrington event with other 

extreme space weather events. 

   Therefore, we first review the evolution of the source active region (AR) on the 

solar disk at the time. Note that throughout this report we use the terms ‘sunspot group’ 

and ‘active region’ as synonyms. We also recover and examine the contemporary 

auroral reports in the Russian and Japanese archival material, revise the temporal and 

spatial evolution of the auroral visibility using known auroral reports (Kimball, 1960; 

Green and Boardsen, 2006; Humble, 2006; Farrona et al., 2011; Moreno-Cárdenas et al., 

2016; Hayakawa et al., 2016, 2018b; González-Esparza and Cuevas-Cardona 2018), and 

compare them with available magnetograms (Nevanlinna, 2006, 2008; Kumar et al., 

2016). With this combined information, we contextualize the results in conjunction with 

those of the other extreme magnetic storms in observational history (see Chapman, 

1957). 

2. Method: 

In this article, we review the contemporary observations of the solar surface and 

reconstruct the time series of auroral visibility during the stormy interval around the 

Carrington event. For the observations of the solar surface, we consulted the 

observational logs by Carrington (1863) and his unpublished manuscripts (RAS MS 

Carrington 1.3 and 3.2), Schwabe’s unpublished observational logs (RAS MS Schwabe 

31), and Secchi’s reports of his solar observations (OAR MS B13; Secchi, 1859, 1860).  

   For the auroral visibility, we consulted the observational reports in the yearbook of the 

Russian Central Observatory (Kupffer, 1860) and Armagh Observatory (see Butler and 

Hoskin, 1987), newspapers in Portugal, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil, and 

further Japanese diaries and Mexican newspapers (see Supplementary Texts 2.1 – 2.5 in 

Supporting Information). We then compare them with the known records reviewed in 

5 

 
 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

Hayakawa et al. (2018b): reports in contemporary scientific journals (American Journal 

of Science and Wochenschrift für Astronomie, Meteorologie und Geographie); ship logs 

(see Green and Boardsen, 2006; Green et al., 2006); Australian records (see Neumeyer, 

1864; Humble, 2006); newspapers in Spain and Mexico (see Farrona et al., 2011; 

González-Esperza and Cuevas-Cardona, 2018), and East Asian historical documents 

(see Hayakawa et al., 2016, 2018b). We compute magnetic latitude (MLAT) of the 

observing sites in the reports, based on the archaeomagnetic field model GUFM1 model 

covering the position of magnetic dipoles from 1590 to 2000 (Jackson et al., 2000). 

Note that the canonical archaeomagnetic field model IGRF12 covers the transition of 

MLATs only after 1900. 

   We compare recovered records around the Eurasian Continent with the known auroral 

reports, with magnetic disturbances recorded in the magnetometer in Colaba (Kumar et 

al., 2016), and those in the Russian Empire at that time (Nevanlinna, 2006, 2008), and 

also update Figures 3 and 4 of Hayakawa et al. (2018b). 

3. The Solar Surface: 

The storms around the Carrington event occur almost in the maximum of Solar Cycle 

10. Figure 1 shows the monthly mean value of the total sunspot number (SSN) (Clette et 

al., 2014; Clette and Lefèvre, 2016), with two peaks in 1859 October (SSN: 218) and 

1860 July (SSN: 222). Likewise, the monthly mean value of the smoothed sunspot area 

(Carrasco et al., 2016) shows two peaks in 1859 September (2300 msh = millionth of 

solar hemisphere) and 1860 July (2270 msh). Frequently the sunspot number has two 

peaks for each cycle, mostly due to the two separated activity maxima of the northern 

and southern hemispheres (Gnevyshev, 1963; Storini et al., 2002). We contextualize the 

1859 storms slightly before the first peak in the SSN and exactly at the first peak in the 

smoothed sunspot area.

Figure 1:  The extreme storms around the Carrington event in 1859 (gray bar) in 

comparison with the double peak of the monthly mean value of the total sunspot 

number provided from Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO; 

Clette et al., 2014; Clette and Lefèvre, 2016) in the lower panel and the monthly mean 

value of the smoothed sunspot area (Carrasco et al., 2016) in the upper panel. 

   During this enhanced phase near the first peak in Solar Cycle 10, a significantly large 

and complex sunspot group appeared on the solar disk, which was visible even without 

a telescope (The Photographic News, 1859, p. 68; c.f., Vaquero and Vázquez, 2009, pp. 

57–102; Hayakawa et al., 2017, 2019b). This large sunspot group was monitored by a 

number of contemporary astronomers such as Secchi, Carrington, and Schwabe. Among 

them, Father Angelo Secchi was the director of Collegio Romano and a prominent 

scientist and sunspot observer at that time. He mentioned this group’s association with 

the great auroral display: “It is extremely remarkable that these great perturbations 

should have coincided with a maximum of solar spots, and should have happened 

precisely at a moment when an immense spot was visible on the disc of the Sun, even 

without the aid of the telescope” (The Photographic News, 1859, p. 68). 

   Within this large sunspot group, Carrington (1859) and Hodgson (1859) witnessed the 

earliest white-light flare in observational history on September 1. This flare was 

7 

 
 
 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

recorded at 11:18-11:23 UT on September 1, and followed with a synchronized 

magnetic crochet ≈ 110 nT in the horizontal force at the Earth (Carrington, 1859; 

Hodgson, 1859; Stewart, 1861; Cliver and Svalgaard, 2004). Note that the source flare 

for the August storm had not been captured by other contemporary observers (e.g., 

Neidig and Cliver, 1983; Vaquero et al., 2017). This is not surprising, as the time span 

of the flare itself in white light is not long and contemporary observers had no concept 

of flare watch before this discovery.   

The exact position and morphology of the sunspot group responsible for these events 

can be reconstructed from the sunspot drawings and associated observational logs by 

contemporary observers. In particular, the sunspot group associated with the Carrington 

flare was recorded not only in Carrington’s sunspot drawings but in those by Schwabe 

and Father Secchi as well. Figure 2 shows Carrington’s drawings of a whole solar disk 

and of the sunspot group that generated an intense flare on September 1. Figure 3 shows 

Schwabe’s sunspot drawings on 1859 August 27 and September 1. Figure 4 displays 

Father Secchi’s solar observations on 1859 August 28 and 31. 

    Comparison between Figures 2 – 3 shows different viewing aspects in Carrington 

drawing than in the whole sun drawing by Schwabe. Carrington used a 4.5-inch 

refractor,	which had a focal length of 52 inches, with an equatorial mount and applied 

a projection method to obtain the solar disk with a diameter of 11 inches for his sunspot 

observations (Carrington, 1863; Cliver and Keer, 2012). Because of a projected image 

on a screen, the Sun’s north and west are found in the upper and left sides of his original 

sunspot drawing, respectively. On the other hand, Schwabe used two Keplerian 

telescopes in which one had a reduced aperture of 1.75 inches and a focal length of 3.5 

feet and the other had a reduced aperture of 2.5 inches and a focal length of six feet and 

dimming glasses to observe sunspots with a direct viewing method (Johnson, 1857; Arlt, 

2011). Therefore, his sunspot drawings show a solar image that is reversed in the north-

south and east-west directions. The orientation of Schwabe’s drawing is in the celestial 

coordinate system with north pointing down (Arlt et al., 2013).  

    Secchi’s observations were conducted with a Cauchoix achromatic telescope, which 

had an aperture of 16.9 cm and a focal length of 238 cm, with projection of solar image 

of diameter equal to 246 mm (Secchi, 1859; OAR MS B13; see also Altamore et al., 

2018). In order to make the comparison feasible, we recast the original solar disk 

drawings in Figures 2 – 4, as seen in the sky on the basis of each observational method. 

8 

 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

Comparison between Figures 2 – 4 show that the locations of sunspots in the Schwabe 

and Secchi’s whole disk drawings are consistent with those in the Carrington’s 

drawings. 

   The sunspot group associated with the Carrington flare is Group 520 in Carrington 

(1863, p.167), whereas Schwabe (RAS MS Schwabe 31; Figure 3) separated this group 

to Groups 143 and 142. Note that Schwabe’s close-up drawing of Group 143 and 

Carrington’s drawing of Group 520 have been reversed in Figures 2 (Carrington) and 3 

(Schwabe). Thus, Schwabe’s drawing resembles Carrington’s drawing in a general view 

of the sunspot group. The entire sunspot group may be identified as an Fki-type group 

in the McIntosh classification (McIntosh, 1990), but the depictions of umbrae are 

different from each other. This sunspot group is also captured in heliograms at Kew 

Observatory (RGO 67/266; Figure 5 of Cliver and Keer, 2012) and Secchi’s projected 

sunspot drawings (Group 219 with a smaller group 218 in Figure 4). The sunspot groups 

recorded in these sources show significantly similar sunspot morphology to those in 

Carrington’s sunspot drawings. Therefore, it is conceivable that the differences in the 

depiction of umbrae between Carrington and Schwabe stem from difference of their 

observational methodologies. 

   These sunspot drawings and heliograms show significantly complex topology of this 

source AR and indicate strongly mixed magnetic polarity. In theory, the white light 

(WL) brightenings, which are the footpoints of strong electron beaming from the 

reconnection site, should be located on both sides of the polarity inversion line. If this is 

the case, the polarity inversion line crosses the middle of this spot group, indicating a 

delta-configuration, the most flare-productive category of the sunspots (see Zirin and 

Liggett, 1987; Toriumi et al., 2017; Toriumi and Wang, 2019). 

  Schwabe associated the Group 143 with other sunspot groups in early August (127) 

and early July (112). If this is indeed the case, this group had been extant and recurrent 

at least for three solar rotations, as is frequently the case with large sunspot groups 

(Henwood et al., 2010; Namekata et al., 2019). Interestingly, the aurora was reported in 

China on 1859 August 4 (see Willis et al., 2007) and a negative excursion was recorded 

in Russia in late September (see Veselovsky et al., 2009), which may support the 

recurrence of this large sunspot group. Further surveys are required to document the 

entire lifespan of this AR.

Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

   The original sunspot drawings show that this sunspot group appeared in the eastern 

limb on 1859 August 25, came across the central meridian around 1859 August 31 and 

September 1, and went beyond the western limb by 1859 September 7 (Carrington, 

1863; Arlt et al., 2013). On September 1, the sunspot was situated at N27.5° – N12.4° in 

latitude, W28.7° – W6.6° in longitude at ≈ 11.2 h UT (Carrington, 1863, p. 83) and 

N20.5° – N16.8° in latitude, W24.3° – W8.8° in longitude at ≈ 9.2 h UT (RAS MS 

Schwabe 31; Arlt et al., 2013), being geo-effectively favourable (e.g., Gopalswamy et 

al., 2005, 2012; Schrijver et al., 2012).  

   The Carrington flare on September 1 was probably preceded by a flare event 

associated with the August storm. While its onset is not recorded, we may expect it to 

have occurred somewhere around August 27, assuming a CME transit time of ≥ one day 

(e.g., Gopalswamy et al., 2005; Lefèvre et al., 2016). The disk center was mostly 

without sunspots, except for a tiny group (141), situated at N20.9° – N20.7° in latitude, 

W6.0° – W3.3° in longitude (RAS MS Schwabe 31; Arlt et al., 2013). The only large 

group (143), which was separated from a small group (142), was situated far eastward 

then, roughly at E57°, N13° at ≈ 9.2 h UT (RAS MS Schwabe 31; Arlt et al., 2013). It is 

quite notable that this sunspot group managed to cause a geo-effective ICME even with 

this unfavourable location (c.f., Gopalswamy et al., 2005; Lefèvre et al., 2016). Cliver 

(2006) considered the ICME hit the earth “only a glancing below” and was even larger 

than that of the September storm, assuming the calculated longitude of E55°-E60°.  

   Subsequently, another great aurora was reported even down to Athens (Heis, 1861, p. 

115; N37°58′, E23°44′, 37.2° MLAT) with a simultaneous extreme magnetic 

disturbance at Bombay magnetogram (ΔH ≈ 984 nT) on 1859 Oct. 12 (see Kumar et al., 

2016; Lakhina and Tsurutani, 2017), while the latter seems associated with another 

sunspot group.

4. Auroral Evolutions and Magnetic Disturbances: 

The large sunspot group (Group 520 in Carrington, Group 143 in Schwabe, and Group 

219 in Secchi) caused a series of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and a 

subsequent series of magnetic storms and auroral displays between 1859 August 28 and 

September 4 (Kimball, 1960; Green and Boardsen, 2006; Lakhina et al., 2013; Lakhina 

and Tsurutani, 2017; Hayakawa et al., 2018b).  

   Table S1 (see Supporting Information) shows the visual auroral reports around the 

Eurasian Continent during this time interval, recovered in this article. The Russian 

yearbook reports auroral displays on August 28/29 at St. Petersburg (56.9° MLAT) and 

Sitka (59.3° MLAT). The September auroral displays in Russia were seen more widely 

on September 1/2 – 4/5, throughout the Siberian stations down to Nertschinsk (40.0° 

MLAT) and Barnaoul (43.2° MLAT). Japanese diaries enable us to add five more 

auroral reports on September 1/2 that show moderate auroral visibility on the northern 

coast of Japan. The aurorae were visible down to Hakata (22.6° MLAT), slightly more 

equatorward than previously known (~23.1° MLAT; Hayakawa et al., 2016).  

   From Western Europe, auroral records have been recovered in the meteorological 

records (MS 117) in the Armagh Observatory (see Butler and Hoskin, 1987) and 

Portuguese and Spanish newspapers. The Armagh records show relatively long auroral 

visibility during the nights of August 28 and 29 and September 2, 3, and 4. The 

Portuguese and Spanish newspapers show intensive auroral displays on Aug. 28, which 

extended even beyond the zenith at Portuguese cities and formed corona aurorae at 

Lisbon (Pt1: 44.3° MLAT).  

   From Oceania, we found a series of newspapers in New Zealand and Western 

Australia. The newspapers in New Zealand reported aurorae mostly on August 29, 

whereas those in Western Australia reported them on September 2. We also surveyed 

Mexican and Brazilian newspapers. Consequently, we located two more auroral reports 

in Mexico. We found no newspapers mentioning auroral observations in Brazil in the 

database of the National Digital Library of Brazil (http://bndigital.bn.gov.br), while two 

Brazilian newspapers mentioned auroral visibility at Lisbon (O Cearense, 1859-11-11) 

and Montreal and New England (Correio da Tarde, 1859-12-10).

   We have integrated these recovered auroral reports from Russian, Irish, Portuguese, 

Oceanian, Mexican, and Japanese documents with the previously known auroral reports 

(see Kimball, 1960; Green and Boardsen, 2006; Hayakawa et al., 2018b). Note that the 

Russian Empire ruled Alaska at that time and had preserved a report at Sitka in Alaska. 

We have plotted their spatial and temporal extents in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows 

the spatial extent of the auroral visibilities on 1859 August 28/29 and September 1/2 – 

2/3 on the basis of visual auroral reports from known datasets and new archival records 

around the Eurasian Continent. This figure shows explicitly that the new data fill the 

existing gap of observations around the Eurasian Continent, especially in the Eastern 

Hemisphere (e.g., Kimball, 1960; Green and Boardsen, 2006). These auroral 

observational sites are partially overlapping with the locations of magnetograms in 

Russia (Nevanlinna, 2008).

between 1859 August 28/29 and September 4/5. The auroral displays were

intermittently visible from August 28/29 to September 4/5, with two remarkable bands 

on August 28/29 down to ≈ 20.2° MLAT and September 1/2 – 2/3 down to ≈ 20.5°/21.8° 

MLAT, assuming an auroral elevation up to 400 km (Silverman, 1998; Ebihara et al., 

2017). This figure shows the data with a clear start and end of auroral visibility. There 

are additional reports (not shown) with auroral visibility between these two bands, 

without a clear description of their start and end. Therefore, some observational records 

in this interval such as those at Armagh are not plotted in this figure, as they do not have 

clear description for the start and end of their visibility. 

   The onset of the first storm is confirmed as a sudden commencement (SC) at 7.5 h UT 

on August 28 with a relatively large amplitude in the declination of ≈ 30′ with a greater 

disturbance after 21 h UT (Jones, 1955, p.104). The onset of the auroral visibility is 

reported roughly after 20.5 h UT on August 28. This is probably because the auroral 

oval extended more actively in Western Europe and North America and started to be 

visible after dark there.  

   The second outburst of auroral displays is almost synchronized with the onset of the 

sharp negative excursion at Bombay around 4.3 h – 6.7 h UT on September 2. Because 

this negative excursion falls in the daytime in the Eastern Hemisphere (9.2 h – 11.6 h 

LMT at Bombay), the auroral displays were mainly reported not in the Eastern 

Hemisphere but in the Western Hemisphere, such as in the cities along the Caribbean 

Coast (down to ≈ 22.8° MLAT) and Chile (≈ −21.8° MLAT), with the equatorward 

boundary of auroral oval around ≈ 30.8° ILAT.  

   Indeed, aurorae were visible in most equatorward stations immediately after the onset 

of the magnetic negative excursion (4.3 h – 6.7 h UT). The auroral visibility at Sabine 

(RG24-2: N11°32′, W083°49′, 23.1° MLAT), St. Mary’s (RG24-3: N12°30′, W088°25′, 

23.0° MLAT), at a ship in the Atlantic Ocean (WA1: N14°28′, W024°20′, 22.8° MLAT), 

and Santiago (S33°28′, W070°40′, - 22.1° MLAT) were reported from 6.1 h UT, 5.9 h 

UT, 6.1 h UT, and 6.2 h UT, respectively (see Table 1 of Hayakawa et al., 2018b). 

Moreover, if we date the report at Honolulu (20.5° MLAT in visibility and 28.5° ILAT 

in magnetic footprint) on September 1/2 as in Kimball (1960), the onset of its auroral 

visibility is 22 h on September 1 in LMT (local mean time) and calculated 8.5 h on 

September 2 in UT, which is slightly after this negative excursion at Bombay. 

   This timing may explain why the number of auroral reports from Southern Europe 

during the August storm is larger than that during the September storm. This negative 

17 

 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

excursion (4.3 h – 6.7 h UT) falls almost at the end of night in the European sector. 

Taking Lisbon (N38°43′, W009°08′), one of the westernmost cities in the European 

sector and hence with one of the sites with the latest sunrise in this sector, as reference, 

the duration of this negative excursion (4.3 h – 6.7 h UT) was probably affected by 

twilight and even daylight, as the local sunrise and the local onset of astronomical 

twilight are calculated as 06:06 UT and 04:33 UT. The Portuguese newspaper at Horta 

(N38°32′, W028°38′, 47.2° MLAT) confirms this hypothesis describing the auroral 

visibility from 5.9 UT on Sep. 2 (28 LMT on Sep. 1 in Table S1) “until the dawn light 

dimmed it” (Pt6).  

   Nevertheless, the auroral displays remained visible through the recovery phase of the 

storm and enabled observers in the Russian Empire and East Asia (down to ≈ 22.6° 

MLAT), and even in Mid Europe, to see these displays into the next night wherever the 

actual equatorward boundary of auroral oval was at that time.  

   The magnetogram at Bombay (N18°56′, E072°50′; 10.3° MLAT, E140.5° MLON), 

whose relative position against the auroral oval was discussed in the context of the 

possible contribution of ionospheric currents (Green and Boardsen, 2006; Cliver and 

Dietrich, 2013), is situated in the Eastern Hemisphere and neighbored by the 

observational sites in the Russian Empire and East Asia (Figure 7). While the visual 

auroral reports from these sites do not provide records with an elevation angle, we can 

combine these reports to make conservative estimates for the equatorward extension of 

the auroral ovals during this stormy interval. The magnetic coordinates of the Siberian 

station at Nertschinsk (N51°19', E119°36') on September 2 is computed as 40.0° MLAT 

and W175.5° MLON. This station is situated in a similar magnetic longitude to the 

auroral observational sites in East Asia such as Inami (HJ2, 23.2° MLAT, W160.4° 

MLON; N33°49', E135°59'; see Hayakawa et al., 2018b).  

   In order for aurorae to be visible at Inami up to 10° in elevation angle (see e.g., 

Shiokawa et al., 1998), the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval needs to be down 

to, at least, 37.6° ILAT for an auroral height of 400 km. This means the equatorward 

boundary of the auroral oval was at least extending beyond the zenith of Nertschinsk 

(40.0° MLAT) during the period of auroral visibility in China and Japan. According to 

the record at Inami (HJ2), the aurora started to be visible from ≈ 16 LT (≈ 07 UT), 

which is before sunset. Conservatively, we assume that the aurora actually started to be 

visible from nautical twilight, that is, ≈ 10.3 UT on September 2.  

18 

 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

   As shown in Figures 6 and 7, a positive excursion of the H-component magnetic field 

at Nertschinsk had ended by the time the aurora started to be visible at Inami. Since 

Nertschinsk was located in the noon-dusk sector, this positive excursion is probably due 

to the eastward Hall current flowing in the ionosphere, which is a part of the DP2 

current system (Nishida, 1968). It is plausible that the enhancement of the DP2 current 

system, namely the convection, had just ended by this moment. If so, the enhancement 

of the convection could have transported cold or warm electrons (Ebihara et al., 2017) 

deep into the inner magnetosphere to become seed electrons of the aurora. The electrons 

transported earthward by the convection would remain for a while after the weakening 

of the convection. The remnant of the electrons is thought to result in the aurora that 

was visible at HJ2 and HJ8 until ~17 UT on September 2. The bipolar variations of the 

D-component of the magnetic field at Nertschinsk and STP (≈ 05 – 10 UT) are difficult 

to understand, and will be studied further in the future.

indicate the auroral visibility at E072°50′ ± 90° geographic longitude (i.e., in the 

longitudinal sector centered on Bombay).  

5. Comparison of the Spatial Evolution of the Auroral Ovals for Extreme Events:  

Having presented an updated view of the temporal evolution of the auroral ovals during 

the stormy interval around the Carrington event, we can categorize the Carrington event 

not as an exceptionally outstanding event but as one of the most extreme events by 

comparison with the spatial evolution of the auroral oval for other extreme magnetic 

storms. Note that the spatial extent of the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval has 

20 

 
 
 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

a good empirical correlation with the storm intensity as indicated by the Dst index 

(Yokoyama et al., 1998).  

   During the stormy interval around the Carrington event, the absolute value of the 

auroral visibility was reported down to ≈ 20.2° MLAT on August 28/29 and ≈ 20.5° 

MLAT or ≈ 21.8° MLAT on September 1/2. In concert, the equatorward boundary of 

auroral oval was reconstructed as ≈ 36.5° ILAT on August 28/29 and ≈ 28.5° ILAT or ≈ 

30.8° ILAT on September 1/2 (see also Hayakawa et al., 2018b).  

   The Dst value of the Carrington event is still under discussion (e.g., Tsurutani et al., 

2003; Siscoe et al., 2006; Gonzalez et al., 2011; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013). Here, we 

need to note that, by definition, the Dst value is reconstructed from hourly averages of 

the horizontal force at four mid-latitude stations. (e.g., Sugiura, 1960; Sugiura and 

Kamei, 1991). In this sense, the estimates of Dst ≈ −900 (+50, −150) nT on the basis of 

hourly average of the horizontal force at Bombay better represents the Dst value, 

although this a single station measurement we still need three more stations for a more 

standard representation (Siscoe et al., 2006; Gonzalez et al., 2011; Cliver and Dietrich, 

2013). 

   These values are contextualized by comparison with other extreme storms with 

“outstanding auroras” in 1872 February, 1909 September, and 1921 May (see Chapman, 

1957). The equatorward boundary of the auroral oval for the extreme storm on 1872 

February 4 is reconstructed as ≈ 24.2° ILAT, based on the reports of overhead aurora up 

to the zenith at Shanghai (19.9° MLAT) and Jacobabad (19.9° MLAT) (Hayakawa et al., 

2018a). The auroral displays themselves are reported down to Shàoxīng (18.7° MLAT; 

Hayakawa et al., 2018a) and arguably down to Bombay (10.0° MLAT; Chapman, 1957; 

Silverman, 2008). The magnetogram at Bombay showed the Dst value to be probably < 

− 830 nT, consistent with a preliminary value from a single station.  

   Likewise, regarding the extreme magnetic storm on 1909 September 25, the 

equatorward boundary of the auroral oval is reconstructed as 31.6° ILAT, on the basis 

of the report from Matsuyama (23.1° MLAT) with an elevation angle of 30° (Hayakawa 

et al., 2019a). The aurora was also reported from Singapore (−10.0° MLAT), although 

Silverman (1995) casts doubt on its reliability due to possible contamination from 

reports of telegraph disturbance. Its Dst value was reconstructed as −595 nT, based on 

the magnetic observations at Apia, Mauritius, San Fernando, and Vieques (Love et al., 

2019a). 

21 

 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

   Regarding the extreme magnetic storm on 1921 May 14/15 (Silverman and Cliver, 

2001; Hapgood, 2019), the aurora was reported down to Apia with a significant 

magnetic disturbance (Angenheister and Westland, 1921, p.202). The Dst value is 

computed to be ≈ −907 ± 132 nT, on the basis of magnetograms at Apia, Vassouras, San 

Fernando, and Watheroo (Love et al., 2019b). The MLAT of Apia is computed as −16.2° 

MLAT based on the authorized IGRF dipole model (see Thébault et al., 2015). The 

auroral display was “reaching to an altitude of 22° determined from star positions noted” 

(Angenheister and Westland, 1921, p.202). Accordingly, we reconstruct the 

equatorward boundary of the auroral oval as 27.1° ILAT. 

   These values are comparable to those of the Hydro-Quebec event on 1989 March 

13/14, with the most extreme Dst value within the coverage of the official Dst dataset 

(WDC for Geomagnetism Kyoto, 2015). During this storm, the aurora was visible down 

to 29° MLAT (Silverman, 2006) and auroral particle precipitation and the auroral 

electric field were confirmed down to ≈ 40.1° MLAT and ≈ 35° MLAT in the satellite 

imagery (Rich and Denig, 1992), although that relationship with the visual auroral oval 

is not completely clear. 

Table 1: Comparison of the equatorward boundary (EB) of the auroral oval in absolute 

value and the Dst values of the outstanding auroras with the Hydro-Quebec Event on 

1989 March 13/14, based on RD92 (Rich and Denig, 1992), S+06 (Siscoe et al., 2006), 

H+18a (Hayakawa et al., 2018a), H+18b (Hayakawa et al., 2018b), H+19a (Hayakawa 

et al., 2019a), L+19a (Love et al., 2019a), and L+19b (Love et al., 2019b). Note that the 

Dst value with asterisk (*) indicates a preliminary value using single-station data, due to 

the availability of complete magnetogram in mid to low latitude (see e.g., Hayakawa et 

al., 2019a; Love et al., 2019a). The equatorward boundary of auroral oval for the 

Hydro-Quebec Event is based on auroral particle precipitation and the auroral electric 

field.

   As shown in Table 1, the spatial extent of the Carrington event is comparable to that 

of other outstanding auroras. As far as currently known, the spatial extent of the 

equatorward boundary of the auroral oval is most extreme in the 1872 February event (≈ 

24.2° ILAT), immediately followed by that of the 1921 May event (≈ 27.1° ILAT) and 

then the Carrington event (28.5°/30.8° ILAT), while the spatial extent of the Carrington 

event varies depending on the dating uncertainty in the report from Honolulu (see 

Hayakawa et al., 2018b). 

   Given the empirical correlation between the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval 

and the storm intensity in Dst value (Yokoyama et al., 1998), it seems the Dst value of 

the Carrington event (September storm) is more likely to be ≈ −900 (+50, −150) nT as 

an hourly average (Siscoe et al., 2006; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013), comparable to that of 

the 1921 May storm (see Love et al., 2019b). This comparison tells us that the 

Carrington event was not the exceptional extreme event, but one of the most extreme 

events.  

   Regarding the 1859 August storm, the minimum ΔH is estimated to be, at least, −484 

nT, as the Colaba magnetogram failed to record its main phase on Sunday (Hayakawa et 

al., 2018b). Colaba was situated on the evening side where the contribution from the 

ring current is large (Cahill, 1966). Therefore, it is conservatively speculated that 

minimum Dst was comparable to, or slightly larger than −484 nT. 

   While the current space weather community expects this kind of event to happen once 

a century with a potential catastrophe for the modern society (Daglis, 2001; Baker et al., 

2008; Hapgood, 2011; Schrijver et al., 2012; Riley, 2012; Riley and Love, 2017; Riley 

et al., 2018; Dyer et al., 2018), the historical evidence indicates that we need to be 

slightly more careful about the meaning of ‘extreme space weather events’. We were 

quite fortunate to have the extreme ICME in 2012 July miss the Earth. Some estimates 

of its potential Dst value appear to be even more extreme than that of the Carrington 

event (Baker et al., 2013; Ngwira et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014, 2019). The extremely 

fast ICME on 1972 August 4 hit the earth with its IMF dominantly northward 

(Tsurutani et al., 2003; Knipp et al., 2018) causing short-term and local magnetic 

enhancements that do not appear as part of the Dst record. This storm was very 

23 

 
 
Temporal and Spatial Evolution of the 1859 Storm 
Hayakawa et al. 2019, Space Weather, DOI: 10.1029/2019SW002269  

geoeffective even in the absence of a deeply negative Dst value (Knipp et al., 2018). 

These episodes in the history of space weather indicate that the Carrington event is 

certainly one of the most extreme events, but is not the single exceptional extreme event. 

6. Conclusion: 

In this article, we have revised the temporal and spatial evolutions of the auroral 

displays during the stormy interval around the Carrington event. The contemporary 

sunspot drawings by Richard Carrington, Heinrich Schwabe, and Father Angelo Secchi 

showed a large and complex source AR between August 25 and September 7. Schwabe 

and Secchi’s sunspot drawings let us confirm the sunspot topology detailed in 

Carrington’s sunspot drawings (Carrington, 1859; Hayakawa et al., 2018b) with their 

resemblance, even though Schwabe’s methodology is different from Carrington’s for 

the solar observation. This resemblance is important because the scientific discussions 

of the Carrington event have been based on his drawing, and now they are strengthened 

by these additional contemporary observations. This AR probably caused a significant 

ICME on August 27 resulting in the first magnetic storm on August 28/29, despite the 

AR’s unfavourable location in the eastern side of the solar disk. The source AR rotated 

to the disk center on August 31 to September 1 and caused the white-light flare on 

September 1, associated with the second extreme magnetic storm with low latitude 

aurorae. 

   The visual auroral reports from the Russian Empire and Japan enable us to fill the 

apparent gap of auroral observations in the Eastern Hemisphere, and complimentarily 

show a long and intermittent auroral visibility through the stormy period from August 

28/29 to September 4/5, when compared with the known visual auroral reports. These 

reports make it possible to estimate that the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval in 

the Eastern Hemisphere extended at least beyond the overhead positions of the Russian 

stations (≈ 37° MLAT), even during the recovery phase of the Carrington storms, after 

the extreme negative excursion recorded at Bombay. The conservative estimate of the 

equatorward boundary of auroral oval in the Eastern Hemisphere provides further 

insights on the cause of this magnetic negative excursion in the context of potential 

auroral contributions. 

   Revising the spatial evolution of the auroral oval around the Carrington event, we 

compared the equatorward boundary of auroral oval and Dst value of the Carrington 

24

storms with those of the other extreme magnetic storms in 1872 February, 1909 

September, 1921 May, and 1989 March. The initial comparison reveals that the 

Carrington event is probably not the exceptional extreme storm, but one of the most 

extreme magnetic storms. While this event has been considered to be a once-in-a-

century catastrophe, the historical observations warn us that this may be something that 

occurs more frequently and hence might be a more imminent threat to modern 

civilization.
