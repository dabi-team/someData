Abstract. β-Ga2O3 has drawn significant attention for power electronics and deep 
ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors owing to its wide bandgap of ~ 4.4 - 4.9 eV and 
high electric breakdown strength ~7-8 MV/cm. Growth of β-Ga2O3 epitaxial thin 
films with high growth rate has been recently reported using low pressure chemical 
vapor deposition (LPCVD) technique. In this work, we have investigated the effect 
of  growth  temperature  on  β-Ga2O3  films  grown  on  c-plane  sapphire  substrates 
using LPCVD. We performed growths by varying temperatures from 800 °C to 950 
°C  while  keeping  all  other  growth  parameters  (Ar/O2  gas  flow  rates,  growth 
pressure, and Gallium precursor to substrate distance) constant. Optical, structural, 
and  surface  characterizations  are  performed  to  determine  the  bandgap,  phase 
purity,  crystal  orientation,  and  crystalline  quality  of  the  grown  thin  films. 
Amorphous islands of Ga2O3 are observed at growth temperature of 800 °C while 
continuous  and  crystalline  (-201)  oriented  β-Ga2O3  thin  films  are  achieved  for 
growth  temperatures  of  850  oC  to  950  oC.  Crystallinity  of  the  films  is  found  to 
improve with increase in growth temperature with a minimum rocking full width 
at half maximum of 1.52º in sample grown at 925 oC. For all the samples grown at 
and  above  875  oC,  transmittance  measurements  revealed  an  optical  bandgap  of 
~4.77-4.80 eV with high growth rate of ~6 μm/hr.   

Keywords:  β-Ga2O3,  low  pressure  chemical  vapor  deposition  (LPCVD),  wide

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Gallium Oxide (Ga2O3) crystallizes in five polymorphic forms: α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ [1]. Amo[ng 
these  polymorphs,  β-Ga2O3  is  the  most  thermodynamically  stable  polymorph  at  room 
temperature [1]. β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic crystal structure with a wide energy band gap 
of ~ 4.4 - 4.9 eV and high electrical breakdown (Ebr) strength of ~ 7-8 MV/cm [2-4]. This 
theoretical  estimation of Ebr is ~3 times larger than other wide bandgap semiconductors 
such as GaN and SiC [5]. High Ebr results in higher Baliga’s and Johnson’s figure of merit 
for  β-Ga2O3  indicating  its  potential  for  highly  efficient  power  devices  with  reduced 
conduction  losses  [6].  In  the  last  few  years,  β-Ga2O3  Schottky  barrier  diodes  with  fast 
switching and high breakdown voltage [6-7], and β-Ga2O3 field-effect transistors (FETs) 
with lateral/vertical device structure [8-10], have been demonstrated with high power figure 
of  merit  and  large  breakdown  voltage.  Due  to  its  wide  bandgap,  β-Ga2O3  has  found 
applications  as  high  performance  solar-blind  ultra-violet  (UV)-photodetectors  as  well 
[11,12]. Properties of β-Ga2O3 are also suitable to realize gas sensors for harsh environment 
applications [13,14]. Because of its high laser damage threshold and high optical power 
tolerance, β-Ga2O3 is also a promising candidate for realizing dielectric laser accelerators 
and  low  loss  plasmonics  [15].  Besides  its  basic  material  advantages  for  various 

applications,  β-Ga2O3  also  has  an  economical  advantage  over  other  wide-bandgap 
semiconductors because of the availability of high quality, large area single crystalline β-
Ga2O3 substrates produced using low cost melt growth methods [16].  

In order to realize various applications of β-Ga2O3, high quality epitaxial thin films of β-
Ga2O3 with  controlled  doping  are  needed.  Power  electronics  applications  specially  need 
thick  vertical  epilayers  with  low  doping  [17].  Epitaxial  growth  of  β-Ga2O3  has  been 
investigated using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [18-19], metal organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) [20,21], mist-CVD [22], halide vapor phase epitaxy [23], pulse laser 
deposition [24], atomic layer deposition [25], and low pressure chemical vapor deposition 
(LPCVD) [26-29] among other techniques. LPCVD is an epitaxial growth method which 
has demonstrated fast β-Ga2O3 growth rates of up to 30 µm/hr, under specific conditions, 
with controlled doping [30].  LPCVD is therefore quite promising for realization of high-
power semiconductor devices with high breakdown voltage, as these devices need thick 
epilayers with low-doping concentrations.  

The growth temperature plays a crucial role in deciding film quality during epitaxial growth 
as it provides surface migration energy to adatoms to reach the active growth sites [31]. Its 
role is even more important in β-Ga2O3 LPCVD as the growth temperature also decides the 
Ga flux. Thus, a detailed investigation of the material quality of β-Ga2O3 thin films as a 
function of growth temperature is required using LPCVD. In this work, on a customised 
in-house build LPCVD system, we have investigated the effect of varying the Ga source 
and substrate temperature  on  grown β-Ga2O3  thin films  over c-plane sapphire (c-Al2O3) 
substrates while keeping the other growth parameters constant. The grown films have been 
characterized using optical, structural and surface characterization techniques to investigate 
the  effect  of  growth  temperature  on  material  quality.  The  details  of  the  experiment  and 
characterizations are presented in the following sections.  

2.  EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 

For performing growths of β-Ga2O3 thin films, we used a customized single zone horizontal 
LPCVD reactor whose schematic is shown in Fig. 1(a). High purity Gallium metal (UMC, 
99.99999% purity) and O2 (99.9% purity) gas were used as source precursors and Argon 
(99.999% purity) was used as a carrier gas. The films were grown by keeping both the Ga 
source material and the c-plane Sapphire substrate in the center of a quartz tube (100 cm 
length and 2.7 cm inner diameter) with ~5 cm separation. The typical furnace temperature, 
Ar and O2 flow rate profiles used for growth are shown in Fig. 1(b). The growth is started 
by pumping down the entire system to base pressure. After 5 minutes of pumping, Ar flow 
of 100 sccm is started which remains on during the rest of the growth and subsequent cool 
down. Furnace temperature is then ramped to reach the desired growth temperature with a 
ramp  rate of  ~4  °C  /min. Once desired temperature is  reached  and stabilized, growth is 
started by flowing O2 at a rate of 5 sccm. The tube pressure during the growth is maintained 
at  ~  100  Pa.  After  a  growth  period  of  30  minutes,  the  oxygen  flow  is  stopped,  and  the 
furnace is switched off and left to cool naturally under Ar flow. The deposited thin film 
was taken out at room temperature for further characterization. Before every growth, the c-
plane Sapphire substrates were cleaned using acetone, isopropanol and de-ionized water 
for 10 minutes in ultrasonicator bath and dried with nitrogen flow. To study the effect of 

 
 
 
growth temperature on the Ga2O3 thin film quality, six samples were grown with varying 
growth temperatures, Tg = 800 °C, 850 °C, 875 oC, 900 oC, 925 oC, and 950 oC. 

The  deposited  β-Ga2O3  thin  films  were  characterized  for  optical  properties,  thickness, 
surface  morphology,  phase  purity,  and  crystal  orientation.  Cary  7000  Universal 
measurement  spectrophotometer  (Agilent  technologies)  was  used  to  take  transmission 
spectrum in UV and Visible range (200 nm – 800 nm). To extract the thickness of β-Ga2O3 
thin films on sapphire, reflectance measurement was performed on Filmetrics, F20-EXR 
thin film analyzer. To obtain surface roughness of the samples, atomic force microscopy 
(AFM)  was  performed  using  Asylum  research  MFP-3D  infinity  system.  To  get  surface 
topographical  information,  high  resolution  field  emission  scanning  electron  microscope 
(FESEM) imaging  was  done on  Carl Zeiss Nova nanoSEM-450 and  JEOL  JSM-7100F, 
microscope. Raman spectroscopy was carried out on Princeton Instruments Acton Spectra 
Pro 2500i system with 532 nm solid state laser diode excitation. In-plane 2θ and rocking 
scans were performed on a PANanlytical empyrean X-ray diffractometer with copper Kα 
radiation  to  determine  film  crystal  orientation  and  quality.  All  the  characterization 
measurements were done at room temperature. 

3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1 Optical Characterization 

External optical transmission spectra as a function of wavelength (200 nm to 800 nm) of 
all the grown thin films are shown in Fig. 2(a). For thin films grown at Tg = 850 °C and 
above,  absorption  edge  is  observed  in  the  UVC  region  around  wavelength  of  260  nm, 
suggesting growth of β- phase of Ga2O3. All the films show high optical transmission of 
~60-80%  in  near  UV  and  visible  wavelength  region.  The  transmittance  increases  with 
deposition  temperature  from  ~65%  at  850  °C  to  ~80%  at  900  °C  and  then  decreases  to 
~60% at 925 °C and 950 °C. The sharpness of the absorption edges also indicates crystalline 
nature of the β-Ga2O3 suggesting high quality thin films. The increase in transmittance is 
due  to  the  improvement  in  crystallinity  quality  of  β-Ga2O3  thin  films  with  growth 
temperature and the decrease in the transmittance to ~60% at 925 °C and 950 °C, is possibly 
because of increase in O-vacancies in the films due to Ga-rich (O-poor) conditions at higher 
temperature which results in increase in absorption [32]. As β-Ga2O3 is close to a direct 
bandgap  semiconductor  [33],  the  power  law  dependence  of  absorption  coefficient  𝛼  is 
given by, (𝛼ℎ𝜈)2 ∝ (ℎ𝜈 − 𝐸𝑔)0.5 , where ℎ𝜈 is the energy of the incident photon, and 𝐸𝑔 
is the band gap. Tauc plots to extract the optical bandgap of the grown thin films are shown 
in Fig. 2(b).  We find extracted optical bandgap of ~4.77-4.88 eV which agrees well with 
the bandgap of β-Ga2O3 [2,3,33]. Optical bandgap dependence on Tg is shown in Fig. 2(c).  

To  measure  the  thickness  of  the  films,  we  performed  reflectance  measurements.  The 
thickness was extracted by modeling the reflectance data assuming reported values of β-
Ga2O3 refractive index [34]. The extracted thickness as a function of Tg is shown in Fig. 2 
(c). Tg = 850 °C sample was ~ 0.41 µm thick while all samples with Tg ≥ 875 °C had a 
thickness close to ~3 µm.  The smaller thickness of Tg = 850 °C sample can be due to low 
Ga flux at this temperature. For all samples with Tg ≥ 875 °C, we found that the starting ~1 
g  Ga  precursor  was  completely  consumed  by  the  end  of  the  growth.  This  might  be  the 
reason for same thickness in all of these samples resulting from complete consumption of 

 
 
 
 
 
the Ga precursor. The observed growth rate of ~ 6 µm/hr for these samples is actually a 
lower bound on the real growth rate as the specific growth time when the Ga precursor is 
exhausted is not known. The actual growth rate is expected to be higher than ~ 6 µm/hr for 
all samples with Tg ≥ 875 °C. The observed growth rate is comparable to reported β-Ga2O3 
growth rates using LPCVD [30]. 

The film grown at Tg = 800 °C shows weak absorption for wavelengths less than ~300 nm 
with  more  than  ~60%  transparency  at  200  nm.  This  observation  suggests  growth  of 
defective Ga2O3 which has either incomplete coverage on c-plane (0001) sapphire substrate 
and/or its thickness is extremely thin allowing only partial absorption. To investigate on 
the substrate coverage of the film, we performed AFM of the sample. The AFM (Fig. 2(d)) 
shows small islands (height ~ 0-100 nm) which do not coalesce to form a complete film. 
Similar  observation  can  be  made  from  Fig.  2(e)  and  Fig  2(f),  showing  surface  FESEM 
image and EDS spectra of the sample grown at Tg = 800 °C. Small islands of width ~50 – 
70 nm are clearly visible in FESEM. EDS composition analysis of surface shows O, Al and 
Ga atoms with atomic weight 53.39%, 44.02% and 2.59%, respectively. The presence of 
high  concentration  of  Al  confirms  incomplete  coverage  of  thin  film  over  the  entire 
substrate. The scattered and isolated islands of Ga2O3 are the reason for finite transmission 
even in deep UV for sample grown at 800 °C. This morphology is possibly because of low 
Ga flux and low adatom energies at temperature of 800 ℃ which leads to island growth.  

3.2 Raman Characterization 

Fig. 3 shows measured Raman spectra of grown thin films excited using a 532 nm laser. 
Raman  peak  positions  of  the  phonon  modes,  as  observed  in  samples  grown  at  different 
temperatures, are listed in table 1.  Raman active modes are divided into three groups: high 
frequency  (~770-500  cm-1)  due  to  stretching  and  bending  of  GaO4  tetrahedra,  mid 
frequency (~480 – 310 cm-1) assigned to deformation of Ga2O6 and low frequency modes 
(below 200 cm-1) are attributed to tetrahedra-octahedra chains [35]. As clear from Table 1, 
the obtained Raman modes are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical values 
reported in the literature [36]. No Raman peaks are obtained for Ga2O3 islands obtained at 
Tg = 800 °C suggesting that the islands are amorphous. For sample grown at 850 °C, only 
few Raman modes are activated suggesting that the thin film is  of lower crystallinity as 
compared  to  other  samples.  For  higher  Tg  (≥  875  °C),  all  β-Ga2O3  phonon  modes  are 
observed in the measured Raman spectra which clearly indicates growth of phase pure β-
Ga2O3 thin films.  

3.3 XRD Characterization 

XRD patterns of as-grown Ga2O3 thin films at different substrate temperatures are shown 
in  Fig.  4.  For  Tg  =  800  °C,  no  film  diffraction  peak  is  observed  suggesting  growth  of 
amorphous Ga2O3. This observation is consistent with the Raman measurements discussed 
in previous subsection.  For thin films grown at Tg ≥ 850 °C, three XRD diffraction peaks 
are observed at ~18.9°, ~38.3° and ~58.9° respectively for all the samples. This indicates 
that the deposited Ga2O3 thin films are of (-201) orientation associated with the β-phase of 
Ga2O3. The (-201) oriented family of planes is energetically more favorable over c-plane 
sapphire, because atomic configuration of  the (-201) plane matches with  that  of  c-plane 
sapphire [37]. For Tg = 875 °C, a small diffraction peak is also observed at 48.7°, which 

 
 
 
 
 
corresponds  to  (510)  peak  of  β-Ga2O3.  This  peak  vanishes  in  samples  grown  at  higher 
growth temperatures.    

From the above discussion, we can conclude that all the samples with Tg ≥ 850 °C show 
single phase (-201) oriented β-Ga2O3 thin films. However, the ratio of the intensity of (-
201) and (-402) diffraction peaks (I(-201) /I(-402))  and  the ratio of the intensity of (-603) and 
(-402) diffraction peaks (I(-603) /I(-402)) shows variation as Tg increases from 850 °C to 950 
°C as shown in Fig. 5(a). Since there are no  film diffraction peaks observed for sample 
grown at 800 °C, its intensity ratios are not shown in Fig. 5(a). The ideal values for these 
intensity  ratios  for  β-Ga2O3  are  also  marked  in  the  figure  [38].  With  increasing  growth 
temperature,  we  observe  that  the  measured  XRD  intensity  ratios  approach  ideal  values 
suggesting an improvement in the crystalline quality of the thin films. Similar conclusions 
can be drawn from Fig. 5(b), which shows decrease in full width half maximum (FWHM) 
of (-201), (-402) and (-603) diffraction peaks with increasing Tg. FWHM is calculated by 
fitting  a  gaussian  function  to  each  XRD  peak.  FWHM  values  decrease  with  increase  in 
growth  temperature,  suggesting  improvement  in  crystallinity  of  β-Ga2O3  thin  films. 
Crystallite size is calculated using Scherrer (Eq. 1) [39] and Williamson-Hall (W-H) (Eq. 
2)  [39]  formula  where  𝑘  is  Scherrer’s  constant  =  0.94,  𝜆  is  wavelength  of  the  X-ray 
radiation = 0.154060 nm, θ is the Bragg’s angle, η is strain in the material, 𝐵𝑟 is the FWHM 
of the diffraction peak, and 𝐷𝑆 and 𝐷𝑊𝐻 are calculated crystallite size using Scherrer’s and 
W-H method, respectively. Lower angle diffraction peak, (-201) reflection is considered 
for  𝐷𝑆 calculation [39].  𝐷𝑊𝐻  and strain is calculated from the intercept and the slope, 
respectively, by plotting 𝐵𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 vs 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 from Eq. 2 and fitting the data linearly.  

𝐷𝑆 =  

𝑘 𝜆
𝐵𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃

𝐵𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 =  

𝑘 𝜆
𝐷𝑊𝐻

+ 𝜂𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 

Eq. 1 

Eq. 2 

A plot comparing 𝐷𝑆 and 𝐷𝑊𝐻 as a function of growth temperature is shown in Fig. 5(c). 
𝐷𝑆 increases from ~25 nm at Tg = 850 °C to ~27 nm for Tg  ≥ 875 °C. In comparison, 𝐷𝑊𝐻 
is  constant  at  ~28  nm  and  does  not  change  with  Tg;  the  films  are  however  found  to  be 
slightly  strained  with  the  strain  decreasing  with  increasing  growth  temperature.  This 
suggests  that  the  β-Ga2O3  thin  films  deposited  at  higher  temperature  are  much  more 
relaxed. These results are consistent with previous β-Ga2O3 growth reports using different 
epitaxial methods [40-42]. 

Fig. 5(d) shows the XRD rocking scan of (-402) family of planes for β-Ga2O3 films grown 
at 850 °C and above. The rocking FWHM values of the films grown at 850 °C, 875 °C, 900 
°C, 925 °C and 950 °C are 1.61°, 2.12°, 1.91°, 1.5°, and 1.64°, respectively, as shown in 
Fig.  5(e).  Among  the  samples  of  similar  thickness  (Tg  =  875  °C  -  950  °C),  the  rocking 
FWHM value is highest for β-Ga2O3 film grown at 875 °C and lowest for film grown at 
925 °C. This decrease in FWHM value of the diffraction peak suggests improvement in the 
crystal quality with growth temperature till Tg = 925 °C. To explore the nature of epitaxial 
relationship between β-Ga2O3 thin film and c-plane sapphire substrate, we performed off-
axis ϕ scan for diffraction plane (111) for Tg = 925 °C sample (Fig. 5(f)). In-plane 6-fold 
rotational symmetry is visible from presence of six peaks separated by 60°.  Since, β-Ga2O3 
has a 2-fold in-plane symmetry which is grown on a c-plane sapphire substrate with 3-fold 
rotational symmetry, the presence of 6 peaks in the ϕ scan suggests presence of rotational 
domains in the thin film [43].  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.4 Surface Characterization 

Fig. 6 shows top surface AFM scan for the scan area of 5 μm x 5 μm for samples deposited 
at different temperatures. The dependence of surface morphology, and crystallinity on the 
growth temperature is clearly visible in images. β-Ga2O3 islands formed at 800 °C (Fig. 
2(d)) gets coalesced into a continuous thin film at higher growth temperature. As deposition 
temperature  is  increased  (≥  850  °C)  the  crystallinity  is  improved  and  change  in  surface 
morphology is also observed. As shown in Fig. 6 graph, variation in mean RMS roughness 
is seen as growth temperature is increased from 850 °C to 900 °C and stays almost constant 
for  higher  growth  temperatures.  The  smoothest  thin  films  are  obtained  at  Tg  =  850  °C, 
which is also confirmed by interference fringes in transmittance spectra as shown in Fig. 
2(a). 

To analyse the top surface morphology and elemental composition, FESEM and EDS was 
performed.  Top  view  FESEM  image  of  Tg  =  950  °C  sample  is  shown  in  Fig.  7(a). 
Hexagonal crystal edges at the surface are clearly visible which matches with the 6-fold 
symmetry of the substrate and the (-201) β-Ga2O3. EDS spectra of the sample was done to 
determine the chemical composition. EDS spectra result is shown in Fig. 7(b). The atomic 
weight  percentage  of  Ga  and  O  was  found  to  be  ~77.9%  and  ~22.1%,  respectively, 
suggesting that the grown films have the correct stoichiometric composition.  

4.  CONCLUSIONS 

β-Ga2O3 thin  films  were  synthesized  on  c-plane  sapphire  substrate  using  LPCVD.    The 
effect of varying the growth temperature (from 800 °C to 950 °C) on the optical and the 
structural  properties  of  the  β-Ga2O3  films  was  studied.  Amorphous  Ga2O3  islands  were 
obtained for the growth temperature of 800 °C, while continuous and crystalline (-201) β-
Ga2O3 films were obtained for the growth temperature of 850 °C - 950 °C. Films grow with 
a high growth rate of ~6 μm/hr for Tg of 875 °C - 950 °C. Crystallinity of the films was 
found to significantly improve with the increase in growth temperature with the best quality 
films obtained for Tg = 900 °C - 950 °C.  LPCVD growth of β-Ga2O3 thin films with good 
crystalline quality at high growth rates will help enable the applications of this material in 
high power transistors, deep UV photodetectors, and harsh environment sensors.
