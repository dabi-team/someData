Abstract 

Background:

 Patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can avoid 

vision loss via certain therapy. However, methods to predict the progression to neovascular 

age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) are lacking. 

Purpose:

 To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm to predict 1-year progression 

of eyes with no, early, or intermediate AMD to nvAMD, using color fundus photographs (CFP). 

Design:

 Development and validation of a DL algorithm. 

Methods:

We trained a DL algorithm to predict 1-year progression to nvAMD, and used 10-fold 

cross-validation to evaluate this approach on two groups of eyes in the 

Age-Related Eye 

Disease Study

 (AREDS): none/early/intermediate AMD, and intermediate AMD (iAMD) only. 

We 

compared the DL algorithm to the manually graded 4-category and 9-step scales in the AREDS 

dataset. 

Main outcome measures:

 Performance of the DL algorithm was evaluated using 

the sensitivity 

at 80% specificity

 for progression to nvAMD. 

Results

: The DL algorithm’s sensitivity for predicting progression to nvAMD from 

 was higher than manual grades from the 9-step scale (67
)
none/early/iAMD (78±6%

±8%) or the 

4-category scale (48±3%

). For predicting progression specifically from iAMD, the DL algorithm’s 

sensitivity (

57±6%)

 was also higher 

compared to the 9-step grades (36

±8%) and the 4-category 

20±0%
(
grades 

). 

Conclusions

: Our DL algorithm performed better in predicting progression to nvAMD than 

manual grades. Future investigations are required to test the application of this DL algorithm in 

a real-world clinical setting.

substantially. It is estimated that 187 million people worldwide currently suffer from AMD, a 

statistic projected to reach 196 million in 2020, and 288 million in 2040.

of progression to advanced AMD within 5 years. Application of these classification systems in a 

clinic setting, in particular the detailed 9-step scale for disease progression, requires manual 

grading of fundoscopic changes of AMD by trained medical specialists or highly skilled graders, 

a task that is subjective, tedious and time consuming. 

A potential solution to reduce workload and improve consistency of risk stratification is 

deep learning (DL).

​ DL has been applied to produce highly accurate algorithms that can detect 

10

eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), AMD and glaucoma with accuracy 

comparable to human experts.

​ The use of deep learning based algorithms have been further 

11–16

shown to assist eye care providers with DR screening efforts.

17
However, most recent work on 
​ 

applying DL to AMD focuses on algorithms for image grading, such as assigning an AMD grade 

for a given CFP

​ or spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images,

18

19

​ rather 

than prognosis: predicting progression to nvAMD. 

In this study, we developed and validated a DL algorithm using CFP from the AREDS 

database to identify patients at high risk of progressing to nvAMD within 1-year. We focused on 

two groups: the first group consisted of eyes with either no, early, or iAMD (none/early/iAMD 

group), and the second group consisted only of eyes with iAMD (iAMD group).

Grades  

We used grades from two AMD grading scales: the 4-category classification scale and 

the 9-step severity scale. The 9-step scale represents changes seen in early to iAMD, and an 

additional three steps capture late-AMD: CGA (step 10), nvAMD (step 11) and CGA with nvAMD 

(step 12). Since the 4-category scale considers both CGA and nvAMD as advanced AMD, we 

split the 4

​ category into two subcategories: CGA only, and nvAMD (with or without CGA). 

th

Distribution of grades across all stereo-pairs are shown in 

Table 1

.  

Grades reversals 

Since CFP from different visits for the same patient were graded independently in the 

AREDS protocol, there were some cases where an eye was graded as having advanced AMD 

in one visit and less than advanced AMD in subsequent visits. However, since such reversals 

are merely an artifact of the graders not having access to prior diagnoses, we excluded the CFP 

where these reversals were observed, as well as subsequent CFP, when developing and 

evaluating our algorithms. 

Data pre-processing 

We used an automated text detection system to discard images that contain text, to 

ensure that the images were completely de-identified. We also discarded images for which we 

were unable to automatically detect the circular boundary (approximately 2% of the images). 

The remaining images were resized to be 587 pixels in each dimension. 

Table 1

 contains the 

statistics of the final dataset used in all experiments.

Algorithm development 

We developed a DL algorithm that takes stereo pairs of CFP of a single eye as input. We 

trained models in a supervised fashion, feeding a binary label corresponding to whether the eye 

progressed to nvAMD within 1-year after the CFP was captured. The architecture of the model 

was based on 

Inception-v3.

​ The original 

Inception-v3 architecture

​ takes a single red, green, 

21

21

blue (RGB) image as input. To adapt this architecture to take a stereo pair as input, we used a 

“late fusion” approach: the left and right stereo CFP were each fed into separate Inception-v3 

networks (with shared weights), and the outputs (post-softmax) were averaged. 

Since our 

network had a large number of parameters (22 million), early stopping

​ was used to terminate 

22

training before convergence. To speed up training, the network was initialized using parameters 

from a network pre-trained to classify objects in the ImageNet dataset.

​ The model was trained 

23

using TensorFlow,

​ following a procedure similar to that previously described by Krause et al.

24

Algorithm evaluation 

We used 10-fold cross validation to evaluate our DL algorithm and compare it with the 

4-category and 9-step manual grades’ performance in predicting progression to nvAMD within 

1-year. Specifically, we split the entire AREDS dataset randomly into 10 approximately 

equal-sized partitions that were mutually exclusive with respect to patients. We then used a 

standard 10-fold cross-validation approach: developing a model on 9 of the folds, and 

evaluating the models on the single held-out fold, repeating 10 times such that each of the folds 

was used for evaluation once. In each iteration, within the 9 folds used for development, we 

used one fold for tuning the model (e.g. determining early stopping criteria), and the other 8 for 

training. 

We computed the following metrics: the sensitivity at 80% specificity, receiver operating 

characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The 80% specificity

operating point was selected using the respective tuning fold, and the specificity and sensitivity 

on the held out “testing” folds was computed. 

Both eyes of each patient were included in the dataset and treated as independent data 

points. However, we observed that eyes that did not progress had, on average, more visits in 

the dataset than eyes that did progress. Hence, treating the 

as independent data points 
visits 
​

may introduce a bias. To avoid such bias we employed the following strategy: we sampled one 

visit per eye 100 times, computed metrics for each sample and then computed an average to 

produce metrics for each testing fold. Finally, we computed the averages and standard 

deviations of metrics across the 10 folds. 

We computed the metrics on eyes with none/early/iAMD in the test set and also just on 

eyes with iAMD, and evaluated 4-category and 9-step grades on the same 10 folds for purposes 

of comparison, computing all the same metrics as described above (

Figure 1

). 

Results 

Among the none/early/iAMD group, the DL algorithm had a sensitivity of 78±6%, and 

the 

manual grades from the 4-category scale and 9-step scale had sensitivities of 48±3% and 

67±8%, respectively. For the iAMD only group, the DL algorithm had a sensitivity of 57±6%, 

and 

the 4-category grades and 9-step grades had sensitivities of 20±0% and 36±8%, respectively 

Table 3 and Figure 2
(

).  

To further illustrate how the DL model stratifies eyes by their risk of progression, we split 

the data points of each test fold into quartiles by their corresponding DL algorithm prediction and 

computed the actual progression rate in each quartile, and finally averaged these rates across 

the 10 folds. This visualization is shown in

none/early/iAMD eyes (compared to a baseline rate of 3.7%), and 17.2% progression rate 

among iAMD eyes (baseline of 7.2%). By contrast, the eyes in the lowest quartile had actual 

progression rates below 1%. 

Discussion 

In this study we compared the performance of a DL algorithm with manual grades in 

predicting 1-year progression to nvAMD among two groups: eyes with none, early, or iAMD and 

eyes with iAMD. Our DL algorithm performed better than manual grades in predicting 1-year 

progression.   

Performance of the algorithm 

On the task of predicting progression of None/Early/iAMD eyes to nvAMD within 1-year, 

we observe that our DL algorithm was more sensitive than manual grades from both grading 

scales, and that the 9-step grades outperform the 4-category grades. The latter observation was 

not surprising because the 9-step scale was explicitly developed to predict disease progression

algorithm could be due to two factors: the potential inconsistency in manual grading, and the 

ability of the DL algorithm to detect novel features that are not captured in existing grading 

scales. We conducted additional experiments to help dissect these two factors, finding that the 

superior performance is due to both factors, but the former is likely more significant (more 

details in the Appendix). 

On the iAMD group we observe that the DL algorithm was again more sensitive. Note 

that in this group, all the 4-category grades are identical, so the ROC curve is a diagonal line 

corresponding to random performance, and the sensitivity at 80% specificity is 20%. Although 

 
 
​
 
the DL algorithm outperforms the 9-step grades, we observe that the absolute performance 

numbers of both approaches are lower on the iAMD group than the none/early/iAMD group. 

This is likely because the none/early/iAMD group is a heterogeneous cohort including a number 

of low risk eyes (e.g. no AMD), and the ability to correctly identify these easier cases improves 

the algorithm’s performance. By contrast, the iAMD group is a comparatively more homogenous 

cohort that is more difficult to risk stratify. 

Related work 

Several studies have reported the use of DL algorithms to detect AMD using CFP. 

Burlina et al.

​ compared the performance of humans and DL algorithm in grading CFP to detect 

25

AMD. Peng et al.

​ and Grassmann et al.

​ developed DL algorithms for automated classification

of AMD. Recently, Burlina et al.

​ t

rained a DL algorithm to predict the 9-step grades and also 

27

the associated known 5-year progression rates to advanced AMD from CFP. By contrast, our 

study aims to directly predict whether an eye will progress to nvAMD within 1-year via binary 

classification. Our approach has the advantage of allowing the DL algorithm to learn any 

features in the CFP that are predictive of progression, instead of restricting it to recapitulate the 

features associated with the 9-step grade. A recent study by Banerjee et al.

​ used a binary 

28

classification approach similar to our work, reporting an AUC of 0.68 in predicting fellow-eye 

progression to nvAMD using SD-OCT scans from two visits using a recurrent neural network. Of 

interest, SD-OCT has been reported to be highly sensitive in detecting nvAMD, though it may 

not fully replace CFP or fluorescein angiography (FA) in detecting various lesions in AMD.

29 

Future investigations are required to build a DL algorithm using data captured from multimodal 

imaging wherein CFP, SD-OCT, or FA may complement each other in identifying different 

lesions or types of AMD missed by one or the other imaging technique.

Limitations 

Our study is not without limitations. AREDS grades were based on assessment of CFP 

alone without the use of FA to validate the ground truth, in particular the nvAMD grades. The 

current model was developed using stereoscopic CFP and may not be applicable to 

two-dimensional images captured in screening programs. In addition, the AREDS cohort lacks 

ethnic diversity and consists mostly of Caucasian participants. Nevertheless, 

our DL algorithm 

could have potential implications in clinical practice for an automated diagnosis of AMD and 

tracking of progression to nvAMD.  

Conclusion 

In conclusion, our study predicted the 1-year progression to nvAMD for two groups of 

eyes in the AREDS dataset, those with either no, early, or iAMD, and those with iAMD. 

Predicting short term progression could help eye care providers identify patients who require a 

closer follow-up in order to detect nvAMD earlier, initiate treatment earlier, and potentially 

achieve better visual acuity outcomes. DL algorithms could also help enrich clinical trials or 

study cohorts with patients who eventually progress, thus aiding future investigations aimed at 

slowing or treating early or iAMD.

Appendix 

In this appendix, we explore several hypotheses for why the DL algorithm presented in 

the main text outperforms manual grading along the two grading scales: Is the algorithm picking 

up novel features that the grading scales do not take into account? Is the algorithm using the 

same features as the grading scales, but doing so more consistently than manual grading and 

thus more accurately predicting progression? Or is it simply more accurate because it is not 

constrained to one of a small number of discrete grades? 

To help answer these questions, we explored “two-phase” DL algorithms (

Figure A1

). 

We shall refer to the DL algorithm presented in the main text as “end-to-end” DL algorithm. In 

the two-phase setup, a DL model predicts the AMD grade of the original CFP stereo pair taken 

in the current visit (i.e. the "current" AMD grade), and then uses the 

 grade to predict 
predicted
​

whether the eye will progress to nvAMD in 1-year. We explored this type of approach for both 

4-category and 9-step grading scales. Furthermore, because a DL algorithm trained to predict 

the current AMD grade outputs a “likelihood” 

over the steps in the respective grading 
distribution 
​

scales, we also explored a two-phase approach where the predicted distribution over the 

respective grading scale are fed into a logistic regression (LR) model that is trained to predict 

whether the eye will progress to nvAMD within 1-year. We will refer to these two-phase 

algorithms as “two-phase (mode)” that predicts a single grade (i.e., the most likely grade, or 

“mode”), and “two-phase (LR)” that predicts both a distribution over the grading scale as well the 

final progression prediction. 

The performances of two-phase algorithms, end-to-end DL algorithm and manual grades 

from the two grading scales among both none/early/iAMD and iAMD groups are shown in 

Figure A2

 and 

Table A1

, and progression rates are shown for the algorithms that output 

 
 
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
 
continuous scores in 

Figure A3. 

For the 4-category two-phase models we observed that on 

both none/early/iAMD and iAMD groups, the LR version achieved higher sensitivities than the 

mode version (74±6% and 50±6% vs 54±5% and 31±5%, respectively). Similarly, for the 9-step 

two-phase models, we observed that the LR version achieved higher sensitivities as well 

(76±5% and 46±8% vs 76±6% and 40±7%), but the difference is much smaller compared to 

what we see for the 4-category two-phase models. This suggests that the coarseness of the 

grading scale affects its utility to accurately predict progression; the 9-step scale is fine-grained, 

such that even a single, discrete grade carries enough information to predict progression 

reasonably well. Furthermore, we observe that the two-phase LR algorithms for both the 

4-category and 9-step grading scales achieved similar performance. That is, despite having a 

different granularity, the algorithm-captured likelihood distribution of the two grading scales 

seem to capture similar information regarding progression. 

We also observed that the two-phase (mode) models for both grading scales perform 

better than their corresponding manual grades. For example, the 9-step two-phase (mode) 

model achieved a sensitivity of 40±7% for the iAMD group, while the 9-step manual grades 

achieved a sensitivity of 

36±8%

. This may be due to the model being more consistent than 

human graders, which then enables better progression prediction. 

Finally, we observed that the LR versions of both two-phase models produce results that 

are slightly below that of the end-to-end DL algorithm on both groups, suggesting that an 

end-to-end DL algorithm may be picking up on some features or signals that neither grading 

scale captures.
