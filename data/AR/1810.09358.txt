ABSTRACT

Context. In a recent statistical study of sunspots in 79 active regions, the vertical magnetic ﬁeld component Bver averaged along the
umbral boundary is found to be independent of sunspot size. The authors of that study conclude that the absolute value of Bver at the
umbral boundary is the same for all spots.
Aims. We investigate the temporal evolution of Bver averaged along the umbral boundary of one long-lived sunspot during its stable
phase.
Methods. We analysed data from the HMI instrument on-board SDO. Contours of continuum intensity at Ic = 0.5Iqs, whereby Iqs
refers to the average over the quiet sun areas, are used to extract the magnetic ﬁeld along the umbral boundary. Projection eﬀects due
to diﬀerent formation heights of the Fe i 617.3 nm line and continuum are taken into account. To avoid limb artefacts, the spot is only
analysed for heliocentric angles smaller than 60◦.
Results. During the ﬁrst disc passage, NOAA AR 11591, Bver remains constant at 1693 G with a root-mean-square deviation of 15 G,
whereas the magnetic ﬁeld strength varies substantially (mean 2171 G, rms of 48 G) and shows a long term variation. Compensating
for formation height has little inﬂuence on the mean value along each contour, but reduces the variations along the contour when away
from disc centre, yielding a better match between the contours of Bver = 1693 G and Ic = 0.5Iqs.
Conclusions. During the disc passage of a stable sunspot, its umbral boundary can equivalently be deﬁned by using the continuum
intensity Ic or the vertical magnetic ﬁeld component Bver. Contours of ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld strength fail to outline the umbral boundary.

1. Introduction

The boundary between umbra and penumbra of sunspots has
long been deﬁned in terms of the continuum intensity Ic.
This brightness diﬀerence is the consequence of the diﬀerent
magneto-convective processes running in umbrae and penum-
brae. We have evaluated magnetic quantities to identify which
of them may cause the diﬀerent behaviour on the two sides of
the umbral boundary.

Jurˇcák (2011) investigated the properties of the magnetic
ﬁeld at umbral boundaries and noted that the vertical magnetic
ﬁeld component |Bver| changes little along the boundaries of the
ten sunspots he analysed and could neither verify nor falsify a
dependence of the median value along the boundary on the area
of the sunspot. The ten-spot average of the median along the
boundary was 1860 G, whereas the mean of the standard devia-
tions along the boundary was given as 190 G for Hinode/SP data.
Jurˇcák et al. (2015) extended the analysis by investigating
a 4.5h time series of a forming sunspot using GFPI/VTT data
and noting an increase of |Bver| at the migrating umbral bound-
ary during penumbra formation and stabilization of this value
after completion of the formation. Shortly thereafter, that part of
the umbral boundary was observed with Hinode/SP and a |Bver|
value of 1810 G measured. They propose that the umbral mode
of magneto-convection prevails in areas with |Bver| > Bstable
,
whereas outside, the penumbral mode takes over.

(cid:63) videos associated with Fig. 3 are available at http://www.aanda.org

Following this line of investigation, Jurˇcák et al. (2017) stud-
ied a pore whose |Bver| remained below this critical value. They
found that a developing penumbra completely cannibalized the
pore, thus supporting the assertion that in umbral areas with
|Bver| < Bstable
, the penumbral mode of magneto-convection takes
ver
over the umbral mode.

Jurˇcák et al. (2018) extends the analysis of 2011 to 88 scans
of 79 diﬀerent active regions again using Hinode/SP and showed
that the Ic = 0.5Iqs contours match mostly the |Bver| = 1867 G
contours. A Bayesian linear regression showed that a model with
constant |Bver| is more likely to explain the data than a ﬁrst or sec-
ond order polynomial with log area as independent variable.
Furthermore the most likely |Bver| = 1867 G, with a 99% prob-
ability for 1849 G ≤ |Bver| ≤ 1885 G. A dependence on the solar
cycle could not be veriﬁed.

These ﬁndings have led to the Jurˇcák criterion, an empiri-
cal law stating that the umbral boundary of stable sunspots can
be equivalently deﬁned by a continuum intensity Ic or a ver-
tical magnetic ﬁeld component |Bver|. In other words, in areas
with |Bver| > Bstable
, only the umbral mode of convection ex-
ists, hindering other modes of magneto-convection. A conjec-
ture can also be stated from these ﬁndings: umbral areas with
|Bver| < Bstable
are unstable against more vigorous modes of con-
vection, that is, they are prone to vanish.

ﬁrst disc passage. This allows us to verify whether (cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ (t) re-
mains constant over ≈10 days, which would provide support to
the Jurˇcák criterion. Hereby (cid:104)·(cid:105)ψ stands for average along the Ic
contour.

2. Data and analysis

The used data are retrieved after processing by the Solar
Dynamics Observatory’s (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) Vector Magnetic Field Pipeline (Hoeksema
et al. 2014) cutout service for NOAA AR 11591. Using this
NOAA AR number on http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ajax/
exportdata.html in the im_patch processing option auto-
matically gives the reference coordinates listed in the ﬁnal three
columns of Table 1. t<E and t>W are the ﬁrst and last time steps
processed, where t<E is before the sunspot rotates over the east
limb onto the sun and t>W is after the sunspot rotates oﬀ the west
limb. A cutout size of 500 × 500 pixel was chosen. The data se-
ries used are hmi.Ic_noLimbDark_720s & hmi.B_720s. For
the full disc passage, there are 1599 time steps.

The heliographic Stonyhurst

For the 180◦-disambiguation the potential acute solution pro-
vided by the pipeline was adopted. This can be done using
hmi_disambig with method=0. We note that for all pixels 180◦
must be added because the azimuth is deﬁned relative to the
positive y-axis of the maps in CCD-frame and exportdata’s
im_patch option rotates the maps 180◦ so that solar north is up.

sswidl’s wcs routines fitshead2wcs, wcs_get_coord,
wcs_convert_from_coord and those they call (see Thompson
2006). The canonical value for HMI of R(cid:12) = 696Mm is used.
The transformation of the magnetic ﬁeld vector into the local
reference frame was performed with a code modiﬁed from and
tested against Xudong Sun’s sswidl routine hmi_b2ptr (see
Gary & Hagyard 1990; Thompson 2006; Sun 2013).

Quiet sun intensity. The limb darkening correction in the HMI
pipeline was based on Pierce & Slaughter (1977, Eq. 9), which
does not consider all orbital artefacts introduced into the con-
tinuum intensity Ic of SDO/HMI data. Even after limb darken-
ing removal and normalization there is a change over the day in
Ic of the order of 1% towards the limb with opposite signs on
the western and eastern hemisphere. To compensate for this, the
quiet sun intensity Iqs for each time step was chosen such that
Iqs is the mean of all the quiet sun pixels within the 500 × 500
cutout, where quiet sun is deﬁned as having Ic > 0.9Iqs.

Contours were taken at Ic = 0.4 & 0.5 Iqs, and the positions
of the contours are used to interpolate the values of the vertical
magnetic ﬁeld component Bver, the magnetic ﬁeld strength |B|
and the inclination to the surface normal γlrf. Vertical is to be
understood in the local reference frame, in other words, it is the
direction of the surface normal.

Due to diﬀerent formation heights of Ic and the Fe i 617.3 nm
line, as well as the Wilson depression (Wilson 1774) and diﬀer-
ential line-of-sight opacity eﬀects (see e.g. Rimmele 1995; Wes-
tendorp Plaza et al. 2001a, and 2001b), the magnetic contours
are projected towards the limb (i.e. outwards) relative to the in-
tensity contours. To compensate for these shifts and get a better
match between Ic and Bver contours, we transformed the coordi-
nates obtained from Ic contours, (x, y), using

(x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) =

before retrieving the magnetic ﬁeld values at coordinates (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)).
(x, y), (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) are helio-projective coordinates in arc-seconds
from disc centre and ∆h is the formation height diﬀerence. Later
on, when the contours from magnetic ﬁeld maps are plotted onto
the Ic map (cf. Sect. 3.2 and Figs. 3 and 5), the inverse of Eq. 1 is
applied, meaning that the magnetic contours are shifted inward.
The value of ∆h = 465 km results from a minimization proce-
dure, which is explained on page 4. The eﬀect of neglecting this
compensation is discussed in Sect. 3.3.

The limits of the time series we analyse are given as tstart
and tend in Table 1. A total of 1063 time steps in this time range
are available. This time range was chosen to select data sets, for
which the heliocentric angle1 of the centroid of the umbra was
smaller than 60◦.

Time series ﬁt. For every time step and magnetic quantity, an
average was computed along the contours, thereby creating time
(cid:111)
series of the form X(t) ∈
. Sim-
ilarly, standard deviations along the contours σψ(t) were calcu-
lated. These time series (c.f Sect. 3 and Figs. 1 and 2) show a
daily variation of an approximately sinusoidal shape. We believe
them to be an artefact of SDO’s geosynchronous orbital motion.
For the ranges from tstart to tend given in Table 1, these time series
are least square ﬁtted against functions of the form

whereby t is in days and t ∈ N is at noon. X0 is the value we
are interested in and will be henceforth called oﬀset. It is used
instead of a time average (cid:104)X(t)(cid:105)t because it correctly accounts
for missing data (most importantly the gap in the afternoon of
Oct 17) and that tstart & tend have a diﬀerent time of day. Here
we have |(cid:104)X(t)(cid:105)t − X0| < 0.5 G for all X(t) in G and < 0.01◦
for X(t) = (cid:104)γlrf(cid:105)ψ (t). While X1 & X2 are used internally during
the ﬁtting process to guarantee numeric stability, the results are
presented with parameters X0, X3, and X4 in Table 2. X3 and X4
are the amplitude and phase of the orbital artefacts. Also listed
are the standard deviations of the residuals σt = σ (X(t) − Xﬁt(t))
and the means of the standard deviations along the contours over
the same range in time (cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t.

Levels of magnetic contours. The oﬀsets X0 from the ﬁts
to (cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ (t), (cid:104)|B|(cid:105)ψ (t), and (cid:104)γlrf(cid:105)ψ (t) for the 0.5 (0.4) Iqs con-
tours are then used as contour level on the Bver, |B| and γlrf
maps, respectively. They are discussed in Sect. 3.2 and plotted
in Figs. 3 and 5 and the videos.

Distance between contours. To quantify how well two con-
tours match we calculated the average distance between them
(cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ, which we deﬁne as the area of symmetric diﬀerence di-
vided by the length of the intensity contour, (cid:96)(t). The area of

1 We note the subtle diﬀerence between the heliocentric angle and the
angle between the LOS and the local vertical. The heliocentric angle,
θ, is the angle between the centre of the umbra and the observer as
measured from the centre of the sun. The angle, α, between the LOS and
the local vertical at the umbral centre is given by: α = θ + r, whereby
r = (cid:112)
x2 + y2. For any position on the solar disc, r is smaller than r(cid:12) ≈
0.27◦. The angle, α, is used to transform between the LOS and LRF
coordinate systems.

The fact that the value for ∆h is larger may be explained with
the Wilson depression of the umbra, which typically amounts to
800 km. The latter causes the τ = 1 surface to be strongly in-
clined relative to horizontal. Minimizing the standard deviation
of Bver along the Ic = 0.5Iqs contour ((cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t column in Table 2)
instead would give an optimal ∆h = 520 km.

These average distances between contours are listed in Table 2 in
pixel. For (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ (cid:28) 1pixel only the total ordering should be relied
upon due to griding and other computational eﬀects.

3. Results

Fit along each contour. For every point along a contour, a ref-
erence angle ψ = (cid:93)(PCD) is calculated, whereby P is the point
on the contour, C is the centroid of the Ic = 0.5Iqs contour in
the CCD frame and D is the centre of the solar disc as observed
by SDO. The angles are calculated on the sphere. For every time
step and every contour, Y(ψ) ∈ {Bver(ψ), |B|(ψ), γlrf(ψ)} is least
square ﬁtted against functions of the form

Those ﬁts are plotted in the right panels of the videos (cf.
Sect. 3.2 and bottom panels of Figs. 3 and 5). Furthermore the
time averages of the ﬁt amplitudes (cid:104)Y3(t)(cid:105)t are listed in Table 2.

Optimal height difference. ∆h = 465 km was chosen because
it minimizes the average distance (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t between the Ic = 0.5Iqs
contours after transformation with Eq. 1 and the Bver contours,
whereby the contour level X0 on the Bver map has been derived
with the ﬁt to (cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ(t) as described above (Eq. 2). An optimal
height diﬀerence of ∆h = 465 km means that the intensity con-
tour at the limb is shifted outwards by 465 km · r(cid:12)/R(cid:12) ≈ 0.65(cid:48)(cid:48) ≈
1.3 pixel. The diﬀerence of the formation heights for continuum
and Fe i 617.3 nm line core amounts to ≈250 km for a typical
umbral model atmosphere (see e.g. Norton et al. 2006, Table 1).

Based on the time series of approximately ten days, in which
the spot of NOAA AR 11591 has heliocentric angles smaller
than 60◦, we determine the magnetic properties for two distinct
contour levels of the continuum intensity. As intensity levels we
use Ic = 0.5 (0.4) Iqs. Along each contour, the azimuthal average
of Bver, |B| and γlrf are calculated. The respective values of those
averages for Bver (in blue) and |B| (in black) as well as sinusoidal
ﬁt of the orbital variation are displayed in the upper panels of
Fig. 1 for Ic = 0.5 Iqs and of Fig. 2 for Ic = 0.4 Iqs. The lower
panels show the residuals after subtracting the ﬁt.

3.1. Temporal evolution
The parameters of the sinusoidal ﬁts, oﬀset X0, amplitude X3,
and the rms of the corresponding residuals, σt, are given in Table
2 for all considered cases. In addition, they are printed into the
plots of Figs. 1 and 2. For the contours at Ic = 0.5 Iqs, we ﬁnd for
(cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ (t) that σt = 15 G is smaller than the orbital amplitude
X3 = 18 G, with an oﬀset of X0 = 1693 G. For the contours
of Ic = 0.4 Iqs, σt = 19 G is also smaller than X3 = 20 G with
an X0 = 1850 G. For the residuals of Bver no long-term trend is
noticeable.

In contrast, the residuals of (cid:104)|B|(cid:105)ψ (t) amount to σt = 48 G
which is larger than the amplitudes of the sinusoidal ﬁt (16 G),
and it shows a long-term variation. Since γlrf is dependent on
Bver and |B|, it has a long-term variation which compensates
for that of |B| (not shown). The oﬀsets X0 for (cid:104)|B|(cid:105)ψ (t) and
(cid:104)γlrf(cid:105)ψ (t) are 2171 G and 141.4◦ respectively at the contours
with Ic = 0.5 Iqs.

−1693 G coincides nicely with the intensity contour at 0.5Iqs.
This animation also demonstrates that contours of |B| and γlrf do
not coincide.

To quantify the match or mismatch of two contours, we have
introduced the average distance between two sets of contours,
(cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t (cf. Eq. 3). It is given in the last column of Table 2.(cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t
is smallest for the Bver contours with ∆h = 465 km (see the ﬁrst
and ﬁnal row of Table 2).

In Fig. 4 the average distance is plotted for intensities chang-
ing from 0.30 to 0.65. The corresponding contour levels for Bver
are calculated as described in Sect. 2 (ﬁt to Eq. 2). The best
match, (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t = 0.44, is found for I = 0.53Iqs with −Bver =
1639 G (X3 = 17 G, σt = 15 G, and (cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t = 82 G). Distances
for |B| and γlrf are in all cases larger and not plotted. Hence,
by minimizing the distance, −Bver = 1639 G results as the value
that deﬁnes the umbral boundary at I = 0.53Iqs. This is addi-
tional proof that our chosen value of I = 0.5Iqs is very close to
the optimum value.

3.3. Effect of neglecting formation heights compensations

For the results presented so far, we corrected for the projection
eﬀects due to diﬀerent formation heights of continuum and line.
As discussed in the end Sect. 2 we assume a height diﬀerence of
∆h = 465 km. Table 2 also gives the results for the case in which
these projection eﬀects are not considered, i.e. ∆h = 0 km. As a
general trend, it is seen that the values for X0, X3, and σt change
only marginally. A plot like in Fig. 1 with ∆h = 0 km looks
almost identical (not shown).

However, (cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t and (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t increase signiﬁcantly. For exam-
ple, for Bver at I = 0.5Iqs, (cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t and (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t increase by more than
30% from 81 to 113 G, and from 0.45 to 0.59 pixel, respectively.
This is illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows the same snapshot as in
the left column of Fig. 3, with the only diﬀerence that ∆h = 0 km.
In this case, the heliocentric angle is 60◦. It is seen that the mag-
netic contours are shifted relative to the intensity, which results
in an increase of (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t, and the variation of Bver along the con-
tour (bottom panels) are larger for ∆h = 0 km. This can also be
seen in the corresponding video of the disc passage of the spot,
which is available at http://www.aanda.org

4. Conclusion

Investigating the physical properties along the umbra-penumbral
boundary of a stable sunspot for a time span of approximately
ten, we ﬁnd three main results:

1. Bver averaged along the I = 0.5Iqs contour is nearly constant

in time.

2. Contours of intensity and of Bver match at the umbral bound-
ary. The best match is obtained for I = 0.53Iqs and |Bver| =
1639 G.

3. Projection eﬀects due to diﬀerent formations height of the
spectral line and continuum need to be considered. If not,
variation of Bver along the contour increases signiﬁcantly.

These results are obtained by analysing 1063 consecutive
SDO/HMI data sets (with a time step of 12 min) of the ﬁrst disc
passage of NOAA AR 11591.

Using Ic = 0.5 Iqs to deﬁne the umbral boundary, we obtain
|Bver| = 1693 G ± 15 (1 σt-error). Jurˇcák et al. (2018) used Hin-
ode/SP data to ﬁnd |Bver| = 1867+18
−16G (99%-error) at Ic = 0.5 Iqs.
The values for |Bver| diﬀer by some 175 G. In general, a dif-
ference is expected due to diﬀerences in the experimental setup

Fig. 4. Average distance, (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t, between contours of varying intensity
and Bver. The contour level of Bver is determined by ﬁtting Eq. (2). (cid:104)d(cid:105)ψ,t
has a minimum for Ic = 0.53Iqs corresponding to −Bver = 1639 G.

The fact that the residuals σt((cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ (t)) are smaller than
σt((cid:104)|B|(cid:105)ψ (t)) is remarkable, but is even more remarkable if one
considers that the gradient of Bver perpendicular to the contour
is larger than that of |B|. This can be inferred from Table 2: The
diﬀerence of the (cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ (t) oﬀset, X0, between the two diﬀerent
intensities amounts to 157 G while that of (cid:104)|B|(cid:105)ψ (t) is only 94 G.
Hence, a small shift of the contour implies a larger deviation in
Bver than in |B|. Therefore, our result of a smaller deviation in
Bver relative to |B| gives further evidence that (cid:104)Bver(cid:105)ψ (t) can be
considered constant in time.

3.2. Contours

Using the oﬀsets X0 from the ﬁts in Table 2 with Ic = 0.5Iqs and
∆h = 465 km, the upper panels of Fig. 3 overplot the contours of
intensity Ic = 0.5Iqs (red), |B| = 2171 G (green), −Bver = 1693 G
(blue), and γlrf = 141.4◦ (yellow). The background images con-
sist of 100x100 pixel cutouts of grey-scale intensity maps with
a minimum (maximum) of Ic = 0.1 (1.2) Iqs. A close inspection
of the ﬁgure shows that the Bver contour matches best with the
intensity contour. The cyan arrow originates in the centroid of
the umbra and points towards disc centre. The centroid is de-
termined by the Ic = 0.5Iqs contour and is derived using CCD
coordinates.

The three bottom rows of panels of Fig. 3 show the mag-
netic ﬁeld quantities along the Ic = 0.5Iqs contour as well as
their sinusoidal ﬁts in black. The azimuth is determined relative
to the centroid and the direction towards disc centre, which cor-
responds to ψ = 0◦ and runs counter-clockwise.

To quantify the azimuthal variation of the magnetic param-
eters, Table 2 gives the time average of the standard deviations
along the contours, (cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t. Again (cid:104)σψ(cid:105)t is smaller for Bver (81 G)
than for |B| (111 G). As before, the small value for Bver is remark-
able, since its gradient perpendicular to the contour is larger than
for |B|. The lower panels demonstrate that the azimuthal varia-
tions are smallest for Bver. Again, we note that this is remarkable
considering the fact that the gradient of Bver perpendicular to the
contour is larger than the gradient of |B|.

A video of the temporal evolution of those contours during
the disc passage of the spot is available at http://www.aanda.org.
This animation demonstrates that an iso-contour of Bver =

and analysis methods. Sainz Dalda (2017) investigates the diﬀer-
ences between HMI and SP vector magnetograms and obtained
comparable diﬀerences. He concludes that the ﬁlling factor fol-
lowed by spatial and spectral resolution are the main source. At
the umbral boundary the ﬁlling factor is 1, and causes therefore
no diﬀerences. The other eﬀects are particularly strong at the
sharp boundary between umbra and penumbra, where the inten-
sity gradient is large.

Hence, these investigations provide evidence that |Bver| is
constant for a statistical sample of sunspots as well as during
the evolution of one stable spot, thereby supporting the Jurˇcák
criterion.
