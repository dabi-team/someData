Abstract. We proposed in Ref.
[arXiv:1812.09285v2] a way to improve energy density
functionals in the density functional theory based on the combination of the inverse Kohn-
Sham method and the density functional perturbation theory. In this proceeding, we mainly
focus on the results for the Ar and Kr atoms.

1. Introduction
The density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most successful approaches to the calculation
of the ground-state properties of the quantum many-body problems including nuclear systems
[1, 2, 3, 4]. In principle, the DFT gives the exact ground-state density ρgs and energy Egs:

Egs = T0 [ρgs] +

Z

Vext (r) ρgs (r) dr + EH [ρgs] + Exc [ρgs] ,

(1)

where T0 is the Kohn-Sham (KS) kinetic energy, Vext is the external ﬁeld, and EH [ρ] and Exc [ρ]
are the Hartree and exchange-correlation energy density functionals (EDFs), respectively [1, 2].
However, in practice, the accuracy of the DFT calculation depends on that of the approximations
for Exc [ρ], as it is unknown. Hence, the derivation or construction of accurate EDFs is one of
the primary goals in DFT for both electron and nuclear systems. In Ref. [5], we proposed a novel
way to improve EDFs based on the combination of the inverse Kohn-Sham (IKS) method [6, 7]
and the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [8, 9, 10, 11], the so-called IKS-DFPT
In this method, the ﬁrst-order DFPT, also called the Hellmann-Feynman theorem
method.
[12], is used, and the known functional is improved by using the IKS-DFPT. As benchmark
calculations, we verify this method by reproducing the exchange functional in the local density
approximation (LDA) [13]. In this proceeding, we mainly focus on the results for the Ar and
Kr atoms.

2. Theoretical Framework
In the DFT, ρgs (r) and Egs of an N -particle system are obtained by solving the KS equations,

where m is the mass of particles, ψi (r) and εi are the single-particle orbitals and energies,
respectively, VKS (r) is the KS eﬀective potential, and ρgs (r) =

i=1 |ψi (r)|2.

The IKS provides VKS for each system from the ground-state density ρgs, which can be
determined from experiments or high-accuracy calculations, such as the coupled cluster and the
conﬁguration interaction methods for atoms and light molecules and several ab initio methods
for light nuclei. As mentioned in Ref. [14], the KS potential VKS (r) is unique concerning the
system. Furthermore, improvement of the EDFs by using the IKS is promising since the EDF
is, in principle, unique for all the electron systems, In our novel method IKS-DFPT [5], the
conventional Hartree-exchange-correlation functional ˜EHxc will be improved by using the IKS.

If the diﬀerence is not small enough to be treated as the perturbation, the ﬁnal results would
be unreasonable.

The right-hand side of this equation can be calculated from the known quantities and its value
and the known functional ˜EHxc. Thus,

hereafter the right-hand side of the equation is shown as C [ρ].

Finally, solving Eq. (7), the Hartree-exchange-correlation functional in the IKS-DFPT in the

ﬁrst-order, i.e., the IKS-DFPT1, is derived as

EHxc [ρ] = ˜EHxc [ρ] + λE(1)

Hxc [ρ] .

Because Eq. (8) is a functional equation, it is diﬃcult to be solved directly. In this work, we

To determine A and α, two systems, Systems 1 and 2, are required. Here, ρ1 and ρ2 are the
exact ground-state densities, and ˜ρ1 and ˜ρ2 are the ground-state densities of Systems 1 and 2
calculated from ˜EHxc [ρ], respectively. Substituting ρi and ˜ρi (i = 1, 2) for Eq. (7), it leads to
the two equations for λA and α. In such a way, λA and α can be determined. Note that in
principle the Hartree-exchange-correlation EDF is system independent, and thus any system can
be used as Systems 1 and 2.

It is found that α and λA are obtained

calculated in all the pairs and their errors with respect to the target valued are shown. Among

all the pairs, α is obtained within more or less 1.0 % errors. In contrast, λ is obtained with
around 5 % errors. Both coeﬃcients calculated from the heavier atoms are more accurate. This
comes from the fact that the density of heavier atom ranges wider than that of lighter atom.

x

The calculated exchange energy density εx (rs) and the ratios

to the target one
εx (rs) /εtarget
(rs) are shown as a function of rs in Fig. 1 for the pairs of He-Ne, Ar-Kr, and
Xe-Rn with the dashed, dot-dashed, and dotted lines, respectively, while the target one is shown
with the solid line. Here, the energy density εx (ρ) and the Wigner-Seitz radius rs are deﬁned
εx (ρ) ρ (r) dr and rs = [3/ (4πρ)]1/3, respectively. The pair of Xe-Rn reproduces
as Ex [ρ] =
the target functional within a few percents in the range of 0.01 a.u. ≤ rs ≤ 100 a.u., which is
generally better than the pair of He-Ne. As comparing He-Ne, Ar-Kr, and Xe-Rn cases, better
reproduction in the high-density region leads to better reproduction of the coeﬃcients, since the
polynomial form of the functional in Eq. (9) is more sensitive to the high-density region.

R

The Wigner-Seitz radii rs calculated in the functional before and after the IKS-DFPT and
the target one rtarget
for Kr are shown as a functions of r in Fig. 2 with the dot-dashed, dashed,
and solid lines, respectively. The ratios of calculated Wigner-Seitz radius to the target one,
rs/rtarget
, are also shown in the insert of Fig. 2. It is found that the ground-state density is also

4. Conclusion and Perspectives
In summary, the way to improve conventional EDFs based on the combination of the IKS and
the DFPT was proposed in Ref. [5]. As benchmark calculations, we test whether the LDA
exchange functional can be reproduced in this novel scheme IKS-DFPT1. By improving the
exchange functional, the accuracy of the ground-state energies is improved by two to three
orders of magnitude, and the accuracy of the ground-state densities is also improved one to
two orders of magnitude. Therefore, the IKS-DFPT is promising to improve the conventional
functionals. Application of this IKS-DFPT to the nuclear DFT is promising.
