ABSTRACT
Current observational facilities have yet to conclusively detect 103 − 104M(cid:12) intermediate mass black
holes (IMBHs) that ﬁll in the evolutionary gap between early universe seed black holes and z ∼ 0
supermassive black holes. Dwarf galaxies present an opportunity to reveal active IMBHs amidst
persistent star formation. We introduce photoionization simulations tailored to address key physical
uncertainties: coincident vs. non-coincident mixing of IMBH and starlight excitation, open vs. closed
surrounding gas cloud geometries, and diﬀerent AGN SED shapes. We examine possible AGN emission
line diagnostics in the optical and mid-IR, and ﬁnd that the diagnostics are often degenerate with
respect to the investigated physical uncertainties. In spite of these setbacks, and in contrast to recent
work, we are able to show that [O III]/Hβ typically remains bright for dwarf AGN powered by IMBHs
down to 103M(cid:12). Dwarf AGN are predicted to have inconsistent star-forming and Seyfert/LINER
classiﬁcations using the most common optical diagnostics. In the mid-IR, [O IV] 25.9µm and [Ar II]
6.98µm are less sensitive to physical uncertainties than are optical diagnostics. Based on these emission
lines, we provide several mid-IR emission line diagnostic diagrams with demarcations for separating
starbursts and AGN with varying levels of activity. The diagrams are valid over a wide range of

of local dwarf AGN in the search for IMBHs. We make our photoionization simulation suite freely

1. INTRODUCTION

The occupation fraction of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) in massive galaxies is near unity (Magorrian
et al. 1998). While LIGO has detected stellar mass black
holes (≤ 102M(cid:12)) resulting from compact object merg-
ers, intermediate black holes (IMBHs) remain elusive in
the 102M(cid:12) - 105M(cid:12) range (Greene et al. 2020). De-
tecting black holes at the low end of this range would
provide a crucial link between early universe black hole
seeds and local SMBHs.

Dwarf galaxies show promise in the search for IMBHs
based on the M∗ − MBH relation (Reines & Volonteri
2015). However, the properties of dwarf AGN hosts
are diﬀerent from those of massive galaxy AGN hosts,
which can complicate detecting AGN signatures. For
example, most dwarfs are gas-rich (Kannappan 2004),
strongly star-forming (Geha et al. 2012), and metal-poor
(Tremonti et al. 2004). Supernova feedback preferen-
tially expels metal-rich gas (Mac Low & Ferrara 1999),
while accretion of low metallicity, intergalactic medium
gas drives star formation (Dekel & Birnboim 2006).

Unlike in the uniﬁed AGN model, IMBHs in dwarfs
often wander within 1 kpc of the center due to the
dwarfs’ weak gravitational potential (Reines et al. 2020,
Bellovary et al. 2021). Therefore, it is unclear whether
the AGN and stellar radiation ﬁelds strike the same gas
clouds, or spatially separated gas clouds, as the IMBH
relocates or settles down in a particular location. This
uncertainty calls into question applying the centralized
geometric model for massive AGN to dwarf AGN.

Another issue for dwarf AGN, unlike massive AGN,
is that X-ray observations that could provide valuable
constraints on the AGN spectral energy distribution
(SED) remain rare for MBH ≈ 105M(cid:12), and absent
for MBH ≈ 103M(cid:12) (Desroches et al. 2009). The few
sources luminous enough to observe are likely outliers
having fortuitous conditions to enable their detection
(e.g. Godet et al. 2012). This situation introduces
doubts about whether physical quantities controlling the
shape of the SED scale down to the lowest black hole
masses (Arcodia et al. 2020).

Photoionization models can provide the missing in-
gredient for IMBH detection by systematically account-
ing for uncertainties pertaining to the gaseous geometry
and properties of low-mass AGN. The left panels of Fig-
ure 1 illustrate open, or plane-parallel geometries, where

the covering factor is small, as typically assumed when
modeling AGN (Elvis 2000; Feltre et al. 2016) and star-
forming regions like the Orion blister (Ferland 2001).
The right panels of Figure 1 illustrate closed, or spherical
geometries, where the covering factor is close to unity,
as typically assumed when modeling obscured AGN like
ULIRGs (Abel et al. 2009) and star-forming regions like
30 Doradus (Pellegrini et al. 2011).

Similarly, photoionization models have used two meth-
ods to take into account simultaneous AGN and stel-
lar excitation, but rarely with justiﬁcation. Figure 1,
illustrates one approach where an AGN
top panels,
and starlight strike the same cloud and thus the SEDs
from each source are mixed a priori (e.g. Abel et al.
2009, Satyapal et al. 2018), which we label as coincident
mixing. The bottom panels of Figure 1 show another
approach where the excitation sources illuminate spa-
tially separated clouds and thus the models are mixed
a posteriori (e.g. Kewley et al. 2013, Mel´endez et al.
2014, Richardson et al. 2014), which we label as non-
coincident mixing. Since dwarfs hosting IMBHs display
a variety of morphologies (Kimbrell et al. 2021), it is
unclear whether a particular gas geometry or mixing
methodology would generically apply. Therefore, assess-
ing all possibilities in Figure 1 is paramount.

Optical spectroscopy enables the categorization of
emission line galaxies as AGN, star-forming, or a mix-
ture of the two using [O III] λ5007/Hβ against [N II]
λ6584/Hα (i.e., the BPT diagram), [S II] λ6720/Hα,
and [O I] λ6300/Hα to form diagnostic diagrams (Bald-
win et al. 1981, Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987). Previous
photoionization modeling including AGN suggests that
optical lines might grow too faint for detection for black
holes outside 106 − 109M(cid:12), thus skewing MBH distribu-
tions (Cann et al. 2019, Bhat et al. 2020); however, none
of this modeling accounts for the multiple geometrical
conﬁgurations indicated in Figure 1, for the presence of
stellar excitation, or for the uncertainty in the shape of
the IMBH SED.

Indeed, optical observations may contradict the theo-
retical impossibility of detection of IMBH AGN. Broad-
line selected dwarf AGN with MBH ≈ 105M(cid:12) can be
sometimes optically classiﬁed as AGN using the BPT
diagram (Barth et al. 2004), indicating high [O III]/Hβ.
Reines et al. (2020) used radio interferometry to iden-
tify dwarf AGN with optical star-forming galaxies clas-

siﬁcations, and used the M∗ − MBH relation to deduce
MBH ∼ 104.1 − 105.8M(cid:12), albeit this relation shows up
to 1.0 dex scatter for M∗ < 109M(cid:12) (Greene et al. 2020).
Optically classiﬁed star-forming galaxies might contain
a treasure trove of additional hidden IMBHs that evade
detection on account of the BPT diagram preferentially
identifying high metallicity AGN (Polimera et al., sub-
mitted; hereafter P21). However, active black holes in
the 103 M(cid:12) regime still remain undetected.

IR spectroscopy oﬀers a better opportunity to reliably
detect IMBHs as it possesses a wealth of high ionization
lines insensitive to gas metallicity and dust extinction.
The Spitzer era revealed the potential of the mid-IR
to separate starbursts from AGN, leading to the devel-
opment of several diagnostic diagrams involving [Ne V]
and [O IV] emission lines and polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbon (PAH) features (Dale et al. 2006). The James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spanning 0.6−28.3 µm,
has the potential to revolutionize the search for black
holes at the low-mass end of the IMBH distribution. In-
deed, recent work has shown the spectral range of JWST

can uncover AGN eluding detection from optical spec-
troscopy (Satyapal et al. 2020), although the uncertain-
ties stemming the from IMBH SED and the conﬁgura-
tions presented in Figure 1 remain unexplored.

In this paper, we ﬁll in the gap in photoionization
modeling to account for the uncertainty in gaseous ge-
ometry, mixed excitation, and AGN SED shape. We
make emission line predictions that will be valuable for
searching for 103 − 105M(cid:12) black holes with optical spec-
troscopy and future JWST observations, while freely
providing our simulation suite to the community1.

2.1. Incident Radiation Field

Figure 2 displays the three diﬀerent models for the
AGN SED that we have explored, assuming MBH =
103 − 105M(cid:12): “disk-plaw,” “Cloudy,” and “qsosed.”
The “disk-plaw” SED combines the diskbb accretion

where we assume ˙m/ ˙mEdd = 0.1 and R = 3RS. The
result is a piecewise, physically motivated SED for pho-
toionization modeling (Cann et al. 2019, Bhat et al.
2020), but lacks physical self-consistency, such as the
accretion disk radiation generating seed photons for the
hard X-ray component.

The “Cloudy” SED is the Cloudy (Ferland et al. 2017)
default AGN SED, which is an empirical model that
assumes the observed SED is the same as the continuum
seen by nebular clouds. The functional form of the SED
is given by,

where Tpeak = 0.77 Tin (Mitsuda et al. 1984), αUV is
the low energy slope in the UV, αX is X-ray slope, and
a is a constant adjusted to satisfy αox. All of the spec-
tral indices are taken from the median of the extinction
corrected BLS1s sample in Grupe et al. (2010).

The “qsosed” uses the agnsed model (Kubota &
Done 2018), while ﬁxing most parameters to their “typ-

ical” values and assuming ˙m/ ˙mEdd = 0.1, a∗ = 0, and
i = 45◦. This is a physically self-consistent SED for pho-
toionization modeling (Panda et al. 2019, Vasiliev et al.
2020, Sarkar et al. 2021) appropriate for sub-Eddington
accretion in IMBHs.

Figure 2 shows profound diﬀerences between the three
SED models. In part, the diﬀerences are due to the self-
consistent physics in the qsosed that is not featured
in the other two models. The qsosed selects the inner
accretion disk radius needed to power the X-ray emis-
sion and then truncates the disk at that point, rather
than arbitrarily selecting Rin = 6GM/c2. This results
in the qsosed SED for MBH = 103 M(cid:12) having approx-
imately the same peak energy as the other two SEDs
for MBH = 105 M(cid:12), and also a more appreciable hard
X-ray component. Throughout the remainder of the pa-
per, we only use the two SEDs that represent extremes:
disk-plaw and qsosed.

To model the starburst continuum, we use the bi-
nary stellar population synthesis (SPS) code BPASS
v2.0 (Stanway et al. 2016) to predict the spectrum emit-
ted from stars subject to binary evolution.
Including
binaries is essential for a realistic treatment of the Wolf-
Rayet (WR) phase, which can result from mergers and
envelope removal (D’Agostino et al. 2019). As out-
lined in Richardson et al. (2019), we adopt a Kroupa
IMF with exponents 1.3 and 2.35 over the mass ranges
0.1M(cid:12) < M < 0.5M(cid:12) and 0.5M(cid:12) < M < 300M(cid:12)
with one of three star formation histories (SFHs): an in-
stantaneous burst SFH at age 20 Myr, an instantaneous
burst SFH at age 250 Myr, or a continuous SFH at age
250 Myr. For a single stellar population (SSP), 20 Myr
corresponds to the age where [O III]/Hβ reaches a max-
imum (Xiao et al. 2018), while 250 Myr corresponds

to the age where the ionizing continuum ﬂux for He+
and O++ (>54 eV) reaches a maximum. After continu-
ous star formation for 250 Myr, the ionizing continuum
ceases to evolve and this provides a “general” use stel-
lar SED for photoionization modeling. We include 11
diﬀerent metallicities calibrated to Z(cid:12) = 0.02 spanning
0.05 Z(cid:12) – 2.0 Z(cid:12) for all SFHs. Figure 3 displays stellar
SEDs for each of the three SFHs at 0.4 Z(cid:12).

To mix the AGN and stellar SEDs, we use both
coincident and non-coincident mixing (Figure 1) with
AGN fractions (fAGN) = 0.0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32,
0.5, 0.64, and 1.0, where fAGN represents the fraction
of the total ionizing continuum attributed to the AGN
SED. Additionally, the cosmic ray background value
ξ = 2.0 × 10−16 s−1 (Indriolo et al. 2007) is added to
satisfy the chemistry network.

2.2. Gaseous Cloud

Following Richardson et al. (2019), we select a hydro-
gen density of log nH = 2.0 [cm−3] at the illuminated
face. After selecting nH, the ionization parameter is
then given by,

U =

φH
nHc

(4)

where φH is the hydrogen ionizing ﬂux. While most
emission line galaxies indicate log U = -3.5 – -2.0, an
even lower limit is needed to explain the lowest ioniza-
tion dwarf galaxies and log U > -1.5 is needed to explain
local blue compact dwarf galaxies (Stasi´nska et al. 2015).
Accordingly, we run simulations with ionization param-
eters from log U = -4.0 to log U = -0.5 in increments
of ∆(log U ) = 0.25. We follow Abel et al. (2008) em-
ploying a magnetic ﬁeld and constant pressure equation
of state until all simulations stop at ne/nH = 0.01. We
include a small amount of turbulence (v = 2 km/s) to
reduce line trapping. We consider both open and closed
geometries as given in Figure 1.

We use the methodology in Nicholls et al. (2017) for
our abundances and scaling. The solar values for Galac-
tic Concordance abundances are largely based oﬀ of
Nieva & Przybilla (2012), Grevesse et al. (2015), and
Scott et al. (2015a,b), which we list in Table 1. The
scaling of abundances with metallicity includes a de-
tailed prescription for accounting for speciﬁc elemental
variations due to diﬀerences in nucleosynthesis. Unfor-
tunately, the abundance of oxygen relative to solar has
become synonymous with metallicity. While metallicity
is strictly deﬁned as the mass fraction of metals, and
oxygen makes the greatest contribution to metallicity,
the two are not equivalent. To avoid this ambiguity,
we refer to the scaling parameter ζO as the metallicity
(see Nicholls et al. 2017) where the solar metallicity is
12+log(O/H) = 8.76, corresponding to ζO = 1.

We assume Orion grains and PAHs throughout the
cloud as implemented in Baldwin et al. (1991) and Abel
et al. (2008), respectively. The dust abundance is typi-
cally assumed to not depend on metallicity, while the gas
(hydrogen) to dust ratio (G/D) varies as G/D ∝ Z −1
(Dwek 1998). Here, we adopt a more sophisticated bro-
ken power law,

log G/D =

0.96 − 3.10 log Zgas

Zgas < 0.25Z(cid:12)

(5)
which shows that low metallicity dwarfs deviate from
a single power law relation (R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2014).

Richardson et al.

The Orion grain abundances and PAH abundances are
scaled from their default abundances by the same factor
to satisfy this relationship at a given Z.

Most photoionization modeling assumes a “standard”
set of gas phase depletion factors derived from a va-
In reality, however, depletion factors
riety of sources.
δX depend on the undepleted reference abundance set
being used and the strength of the depletion F∗. We fol-
low a self-consistent approach where we use our unique
reference abundances with the methodology outlined in
Jenkins (2009). The strength of the depletion is selected
so that the depletion factor for iron is δF e = −1.5 dex
as in Thomas et al. (2018). This results in δO = −0.11
dex, which is less than the commonly assumed Cloudy
default of δO = −0.22 dex, but assists in matching op-
tical emission line diagnostics (Gutkin et al. 2016) and
matches the depletion derived from analyzing dust grain
composition (Peimbert & Peimbert 2010), X-ray spec-
troscopy (Pinto et al. 2013), and α-element enhancement
(Amayo et al. 2021). In reality, depletion factors should
change with G/D at a ﬁxed metallicity and as a func-
tion of metallicity (Peimbert & Peimbert 2010, De Cia
et al. 2016); however, this is rarely taken into account in
photoionization modeling and beyond the scope of this
work. The complete set of adopted depletion factors are
listed in Table 1 and we elaborate on our methodology in
Appendix A. Our ﬁnal gas phase abundances diﬀer from
the BPASS stellar abundances, the eﬀects of which have
been investigated in Grasha et al. (2021), but are be-
yond the scope of this work. All in all, our model suite
consists of > 6.33 × 104 simulations.

3. LINE RATIO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

We seek to assess the sensitivity of emission line ra-
tios to fAGN, AGN SED shape, mixing methodology,
and geometry.
In particular, we select emission line
diagnostics that are detectable in purely star forming
galaxies, enabling investigation of the connection be-
tween star formation and AGN in dwarfs, which is not
possible for all emission lines. For example, the pres-
ence of [Ne V] 14.3µm or [Ne VI] 7.65 µm alone signals
AGN activity, but our simulations show that [Ne V] is
unlikely to be detectable in most local dwarfs where U
and fAGN are small, thus making it an unreliable tracer
of AGN fraction for all galaxy masses.

Similarly, coronal lines from highly ionized states (e.g.,
Si VI, Fe XIII) have been used to identify AGN (Cann
et al. 2018, Bohn et al. 2021, Kimbro et al. 2021). How-
ever, several limitations exist to this approach: (1) only
about half of AGN actually show coronal line(s), regard-
less of instrumental line sensitivity (Riﬀel et al. 2006);
(2) highly ionized states depend on physical conditions

with high U ∼ −2.0 and high fAGN > 0.64, which
are not characteristic of typical dwarfs; (3) if present,
the coronal line region lies between the BLR and NLR,
which implies dust sublimation is important, a process
that presents a problem for self-consistent photoioniza-
tion modeling (Mazzalay et al. 2010, Adhikari et al.
2016); (4) coronal line emission typically originates from
metals that become heavily depleted in forming dust
grains (e.g., Si, Ca, Fe), and therefore small changes to
F∗ yield large diﬀerences in these abundances (De Cia
et al. 2016). All together, these limitations suggest that
using coronal lines will be subject to strong selection
bias, and therefore alone cannot provide a complete pic-
ture of IMBH activity in dwarf AGN.

With these caveats in mind, we have determined three
diﬀerent mass ranges to evaluate the AGN emission line
diagnostics within the wavelength ranges of SDSS and
JWST: lower mass dwarfs, intermediate mass dwarfs,
and massive galaxies.

• For lower mass dwarfs, we use the U −Z correlation
presented in Kashino & Inoue (2019), which leads
to values of log U ≈ −2.0, Z/Z(cid:12) ≈ 0.15.

• For intermediate mass dwarfs, we analyzed SDSS
strong emission line measurements
(Tremonti
et al. 2004) as processed by P21 for the z∼0
dwarf dominated RESOLVE Survey (Kannappan
& Wei 2008) with the Bayesian analysis code
NebulaBayes (Thomas et al. 2018), but using our
simulation suite. We determine median values of
log U ≈ −3.25, Z/Z(cid:12) ≈ 0.4 for intermediate mass
dwarfs (P21), which can be thought of as a ‘ﬁdu-
cial’ set of parameters for dwarf galaxies.

• For massive galaxies, we adopt log U ≈ −2.0,
Z/Z(cid:12) ≈ 1.0 following the parameters used in
(Abel et al. 2009) to model AGN in massive galax-
ies such as ULIRGs.

For the rest of §3, we use the stellar SED resulting
from continuous SFH at 250 Myr as it represents a “gen-
eral purpose” ionizing continuum not purposefully con-
structed for maximizing any particular emission line ra-
tio.

to diﬀerences in assuming a spherical or plane parallel
geometry, while the color indicates the AGN SED and
mixing methodology being used. Other diagnostics are
presented in Appendix B, such as the metallicity sensi-
tive [N II]/Hα ratio.

A few major trends are apparent in Figures 4 and 5.
First, the eﬀect that physical uncertainties have on emis-
sion line ratios is exacerbated for lower MBH. Second,
the greatest variation in emission line ratios due to fAGN
occurs in the range 0.0 ≤ fAGN ≤ 0.32. The diagnostics
[O III]/Hβ and [S II]/Hα are generally poorer tracers
of fAGN. Lastly, in the dwarf galaxy mass regimes, di-
agnostics show less dependence on geometry, in stark
contrast to massive galaxies where the diagnostics can
show up to ∼1.0 dex variation for MBH = 103M(cid:12).

The photoionization cross section of hydrogen quickly
decreases as photon energy increases (Osterbrock & Fer-
land 2006). As a result, X-rays due to an AGN penetrate
into neutral gas, which causes collisions that excite neu-
tral species. Since [O I] λ6300 partially originates from

neutral gas, [O I]/Hα traces fAGN rather well in dwarf
galaxy mass regimes in contrast to the other optical di-
agnostics. This makes it a reliable choice for detecting
AGN activity in dwarfs and constraining fAGN. Non-
ionizing photons can also pump electrons into high en-
ergy excited states, which can cause [O I] λ6300 emission
when the electrons cascade to lower energy levels. This
continuum ﬂuorescence process is rather ineﬃcient for
O I (Bautista 1999), leaving collision excitation as the
dominant process, and thus preserving the utility of [O I]
λ6300 as an AGN diagnostic.

The AGN SED and mixing methodology can create
substantial variation in all diagnostics, although this is
mitigated for emission line ratios created under certain
physical conditions. For example, the middle rows of
Figures 4 and 5 show that considering fAGN ≥ 0.32, the
emission line ratios converge upon [O III]/Hβ ≈ −0.3
to 0.7 and [O I]/Hα ≈ −1.2 to −0.2, generally resulting
in a LINER classiﬁcation (Kewley et al. 2006). This re-
sult, combined with a star-forming galaxy classiﬁcation

from the metallicity sensitive BPT diagram, corrobo-
rates that dwarf AGN have inconsistent optical classiﬁ-
cations (Reines et al. 2020, P21) for black hole masses
in the range 103 − 105 M(cid:12).

Our results also stand in contrast to other work (Cann
et al. 2019), suggesting that AGN host galaxies with
∼ 103M(cid:12) BHs have such low [O III]/Hβ ≈ −1.5 that
[O III] emission might be undetectable 2. Figure 4
clearly shows that [O III]/Hβ is highly dependent on
the physical uncertainties presented in Figure 1 and the
galaxy mass regime of interest. RESOLVE dwarf galax-
ies are ubiquitously star-forming with fAGN < 0.6 and
are the most likely hosts for IMBHs. For the intermedi-
ate mass dwarf galaxy regime, we see in the majority of
cases that [O III]/Hβ ≥ 0.0, i.e. [O III] as strong as Hβ.

2 Private communication with Jenna Cann, Shobita Satyapal, and
Nick Abel suggests that possible physical explanations could in-
clude diﬀerences in assumed AGN SED shape, in choice of ele-
mental abundances, or in geometry and mixing, as diagrammed
in Figure 1.

3.2. Mid-IR

The most valuable AGN diagnostics for JWST come
from the MIRI instrument (4.9 - 28.3 µm), as opposed
to NIRspec (0.6 - 5.3 µm), based on the availability of
either emission lines originating from the same element
with diﬀerent ionization potentials, or high ionization
lines along with a recombination line for comparison.
Although we are focused on detecting active IMBHs in
relatively local galaxies, it is worth noting that galaxies
at z > 0.3 will have optical diagnostics that fall within
NIRspec, thereby providing additional constraints. The
following lines show diagnostic value for AGN activity
and are detectable until z ∼ 0.1 assuming the MIRI
line sensitivity of 3.3 × 10−17 erg/s/cm−2: Pfα, [Ne II]
12.8µm, [Ne III] 15.6µm, [Ar II] 6.98µm, [Ar III] 8.99µm,
[Ar V] 13.1µm, [S III] 18.7µm, [S IV] 10.5µm, and [O IV]
25.9µm. This result is independent of geometry, mixing
methodology, or AGN SED shape.

become less pronounced as AGN fraction increases; in
contrast to the optical, IR line ratios generally show less
sensitivity to geometry. Weaver et al. (2010) suggests
that [Ne III]/[Ne II] and [O IV]/[Ne III] have the ability
to eﬀectively separate excitation mechanisms. The ﬁrst
column in both ﬁgures indicates that [Ne III]/[Ne II]
remains constant with AGN fraction for intermediate
mass dwarfs (second row) and massive galaxies (third
row). Therefore, [Ne III]/[Ne II] is not a robust indicator
of AGN activity. It does, however, remain an eﬀective
fAGN diagnostic for the low-mass dwarf galaxies, with
minor sensitivity to the mixing methodology and SED
selection. The second column shows that [Ar II]/Pfα has
strong diagnostic potential for all galaxy masses, espe-
cially for MBH = 105M(cid:12) (Figure 7). As MBH decreases,
the [Ar II]/Pfα still eﬀectively traces fAGN, but the un-
certainty of the AGN SED and mixing methodology in-
troduces greater spread in the emission line predictions.
The last column in Figures 6 and 7 shows that
[O IV]/Pfα is also an eﬀective fAGN diagnostic. At
MBH = 105M(cid:12),
[O IV]/Pfα traces fAGN quite well,
while remaining relatively insensitive to the shape of

the AGN SED and the uncertainties given in Figure 1.
[O IV]/Pfα remains well-behaved for MBH = 103M(cid:12) ex-
cept for intermediate mass dwarfs where the disk-plaw,
non-coincident mixing case creates a ∼1.0 dex spread in
values relative to the other cases. This spread is due to
the combined eﬀect of a low U and harder accretion disk
reducing the number O++ ionizing photons.

In general, line ratios featuring [O IV] and [Ar II]
show less sensitivity to geometry than optical diagnos-
tics, display more variation with AGN fraction than
other mid-IR line ratios, and retain their diagnostic po-
tential over a wider range of galaxy masses and BH
masses. The mid-IR diagnostics provide greater con-
straints on fAGN for lower levels of AGN activity ex-
pected for dwarf AGN with IMBHs, compared to opti-
cal diagnostics which are more sensitive to higher levels
of AGN activity. These results highlight the beneﬁt of
using multiple line ratios to constrain fAGN with diag-
nostic diagrams.

able for detecting AGN excitation, and ideally measur-
ing fAGN, for a given galaxy. To compare our models
to galaxies with spectroscopic observations, we select a
subset of models (−3.5 ≤ log U ≤ −1.5) with an instan-
taneous SFH, since the harder stellar continua provide
a limiting case for AGN activity.

4.1. Optical

We use a 20 Myr SSP for the optical diagnostics
since this SFH maximizes the [O III]/Hβ line ratio used
in many diagnostic diagrams that separate AGN and
star forming galaxies. For the observational sample,
we choose dwarf galaxies in the MPA-JHU sample from
P21. Following P21, we classify dwarf AGN as any dwarf
galaxies not classiﬁed as deﬁnitely star forming (e.g.,
traditional AGN, LINERs, etc.) The three diagrams
from Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987) are by far the most
commonly used optical diagnostics for separating AGN
and star forming galaxies, so we focus our analysis on
them.

Figure 8 displays these diagrams for MBH = 103M(cid:12)
(left column) and MBH = 105M(cid:12) (right column). The
models for fAGN = 0.04, 0.08, and ≥0.16 approximately

span the area of the three hatched shapes (tan, purple,
and green, respectively). For models with fAGN ≥ 0.16
and a 103M(cid:12) black hole, there is a wide range of possi-
ble values for [O III]/Hβ, highly dependent on conﬁgu-
rations present in Figure 1. This large spread in values
relates to the current diﬃculty of detecting IMBHs at
this mass, but also provides promise that optical detec-
tion is indeed possible.

Figure 8 shows that models in the range 0 ≤ fAGN ≤
0.16 occupy similar regions of each diagram.
In par-
ticular, the BPT diagram (top row) registers observed
dwarf AGN as consistent with pure star formation. Con-
versely, theoretical models with pure star formation can
cross over into the AGN region of the diagram. De-
spite the diﬀerences in photoionization modeling, this is
also seen in Xiao et al. (2018) on account of using the
BPASS SEDs that feature substantially harder continua
than many other SPS codes.

The [S II]/Hα diagram indicates that pure star for-
mation can reproduce the line ratios of all the dwarf
AGN shown, but unlike for the BPT diagram, for the
[S II]/Hα diagram this result only occurs with the par-

WR stars and thereby sets a lower limit for AGN activity. Pure starburst models (0% AGN) are displayed as blue stars. The
models for a given fAGN approximately span the area of each hatched shape. The demarcations in each diagram are taken from
Kewley et al. (2001), Kauﬀmann et al. (2003), and Kewley et al. (2006). The majority of observed dwarf AGN lie in the star
forming wing of the BPT diagram (top panels), which models with and without AGN can reproduce.

ticularly hard stellar SED that we have selected. Thus,
knowing the SFHs for a given sample of dwarfs could
provide justiﬁcation for using [S II]/Hα to identify AGN.
In contrast, the BPT diagram is more generally a poor
diagnostic for identifying dwarf AGN, regardless of SFH,
as discussed in more detail in P21.

The last optical diagnostic diagram shows that some
dwarf AGN require models with an AGN component to
reproduce the observed [O I]/Hα, making this diagram
more reliable in separating star formation and AGN in
dwarfs (Reines et al. 2020, P21).
It is worth noting
that more dwarf AGN likely require an AGN component
than shown here, on account of the hard stellar SED
used in this analysis. Additionally, for [O I]/Hα there is
some modest separation between models with diﬀerent
fAGN, especially with MBH = 103M(cid:12), enabling a better
assessment of AGN activity as also shown in Figure 4.

4.2. Mid-IR

For our observational sample, we choose dwarf SF
(Cormier et al. 2015) and dwarf AGN (Hood et al.
2017) observations requiring that the AGN satisfy
[Ne V]/[Ne II]>0.1 (Inami et al. 2013). It is important
to note that Pfα, featured in Figure 6, is not available in
statistical samples due to the low sensitivity and resolu-
tion of Spitzer and ISO. Similarly, since [Ar II] 6.98µm
is unavailable for samples including dwarfs, we use mas-
sive AGN (Sturm et al. 2002) for diagnostic diagrams
with this line.

We have tested all possible emission line ratio combi-
nations from the emission lines listed in §3.1.2. Figure 9
shows the results of this analysis in three diagnostic di-
agrams featuring emission line ratios also presented in
Weaver et al. (2010), Inami et al. (2013), and Hao et al.
(2009).

Our new demarcations separate three distinct regions:
the SF region contains only pure starburst galaxies; the
SF and/or AGN region contains a mixture of pure star-
bursts and AGN; the AGN region contains only AGN.
The divisions between SF and SF and/or AGN regions
are given by,

log [Ne III]/[Ne II] = 0.3 log [O IV]/[Ne III] − 0.9 (6)

log[O IV]/[Ne III] = 1.25 log [S IV]/[Ne II] - 0.125 (7)

log [O IV]/[S III] = 1.2 (log [S IV]/[Ar II]+1.4) 1

2 - 3.0 (8)

while the AGN region is formed by [O IV]/[Ne III] = −1
and [O IV]/[S III] = −0.8.

The ﬁrst diagram (top panels) has frequently been
used to separate starbursts and AGN into quadrants ac-
cording to [O IV]/[Ne III] = 0 (Weaver et al. 2010), but
this cutoﬀ excludes dwarf AGN with [O IV]/[Ne III] >
−1, which our new demarcations recover. Our mod-
els indicate that the observed dwarf AGN in this re-
gion have at least a 4-16% AGN contribution. The sec-
ond diagram (center panels) replaces the abscissa with
[S IV]/[Ne II] (Inami et al. 2013), resulting in a cleaner
separation of starbursts and AGN at low ionization. The
last diagram (bottom panels) uses [O IV]/[S III] in the
ordinate (Hao et al. 2009) and [S IV]/[Ar II] in the ab-
scissa, which creates even more separation between star-
bursts and AGN, and also between fAGN values. As
mentioned above, the [Ar II] observations are poor since
Spitzer was only capable of detecting wavelengths <10
microns in low resolution mode (R ∼ 130). In contrast,
MIRI features the highest resolution (R ∼ 3100) and
line sensitivity available at these wavelengths. Thus,
the right panels in Figure 9 present a promising new
diagnostic for JWST observations to constrain AGN ac-
tivity.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have explored several key uncertain-
ties that will be critical to assess in the upcoming era of
detecting IMBHs: the shape of the AGN SED, the sur-
rounding gas cloud geometry, and the manner of mixing
radiation from AGN and stars. The diversity of models
for the AGN SED in Figure 2 emphasizes the impor-
tance of next generation X-ray facilities such as Lynx
and Athena that will enable proper constraints on low
luminosity sources. We show that all of the listed un-
certainties have profound eﬀects on emission line diag-
nostics in the optical and mid-IR. This has implications
for statistical samples of galaxies that are analyzed with
photoionization models that implicitly assume a partic-
ular geometrical conﬁguration or mixing methodology in
Figure 1. Such assumptions can lead to powerful selec-
tion eﬀects (Ferguson et al. 1997, Meskhidze & Richard-
son 2017). These assumptions could limit the applicabil-
ity of simple relationships that scale physical properties
(e.g., fAGN, MBH) with emission lines ratios for large
samples of galaxies.

Even though degeneracies abound in the optical, we
ﬁnd AGN diagnostics remain detectable in most situa-
tions across a range of galaxy masses. This result of-
fers promise that surveys like SDSS have already picked
up signatures of AGN with MBH = 103 M(cid:12). Unfortu-
nately, the gold standard for optical AGN classiﬁcation,
the BPT diagram, poorly traces AGN activity in dwarf
galaxies. As we argue in P21, this is due to [N II]/Hα

Pure starburst models (0% AGN) are displayed as blue stars. The models for a given fAGN approximately span the area of each
hatched shape. The SF, SF and/or AGN, and AGN regions represent pure starburst galaxies, a mix of pure starburst galaxies
and AGN, and only AGN, respectively (eqns 6, 7, 8). JWST will enable emission lines normally missing from Spitzer spectra
to serve as additional constraints, like [Ar II] 6.99 µm (left panels).

although soft X-ray and hard X-ray emission is typically
detected in these galaxies.

Current SPS models are unable to produce enough
photons >54 eV to account for this crossover. High
mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) can generate the hard
photons needed to create AGN-like emission line ratios
assuming a model with high U , high LX /SFR, and a suf-
ﬁciently hard SED (Simmonds et al. 2021). It is unlikely
that HMXBs can uniformly account for dwarfs exhibit-
ing emission line ratios characteristic of AGN given that
the shape of the HMXB SED remains highly uncertain
and most dwarf AGN do not present these extreme con-
ditions (P21). Additionally, a more generic treatment
of the HMXB SED has shown that HMXBs are an in-
eﬃcient means of producing photons >54 eV (Senchyna
et al. 2020). Therefore, unless more realistic treatment
of the WR phase alters the result of our predictions in
the future, our current simulations suggest these galax-
ies have active AGN. The SF and/or AGN region in each
diagram can contain optically classiﬁed starbursts (see
Figure 9), and this result is reproduced by a photoion-
ization model with multiple gas clouds (Mel´endez et al.
2014, Richardson et al. 2016). IFU observations should
help clarify whether such a model needs to be invoked.
To fully address modeling degeneracies in both the
optical and mid-IR, Bayesian analysis will be a valu-
able tool for extracting meaningful properties over a
range of conditions in future studies. Our simulation
suite incorporates a ﬁner spacing of metallicities, ideal
for accurate Bayesian analysis at < 0.4 Z(cid:12) (Richardson
et al. 2019), than other SPS models (e.g., Starburst99),
while robustly accounting for D/G and elemental de-
pletion. In addition, the mixing methodologies and ge-
ometries unique to our models could be used in a multi-
component ISM analysis, similar to work on the multi-
phase ISM in dwarfs (Cormier et al. 2019). Together
with the AGN diagnostics and excitation diagrams pre-
sented in this paper, such future applications of our
models will prove useful for addressing more complex
topologies associated with mixed AGN/SF excitation in
dwarfs in the era of JWST.

being metallicity sensitive and fAGN insensitive. It also
reﬂects the sensitivity of [O III]/Hβ to the uncertainties
explored in this paper. Actually, as seen in Reines et al.
2020 and P21, the often forgotten [O I]/Hα diagnostic
is a stronger metric for an active AGN in dwarfs given
its sensitivity to fAGN and relative insensitivity to phys-
ical uncertainties. It therefore serves as the best optical
emission line ratio for ﬁnding dwarf AGN, but the rela-
tive weakness of the [O I] line does limit the sample that
can be tested (P21).

Relatively high-mass dwarfs (M∗ (cid:46) 109.3−9.5M(cid:12))
classiﬁed as LINERs present an opportunity to ﬁnd the
coveted 103 M(cid:12) black holes, which would ﬁll in a major
gap in IMBH empirical relationships and help constrain
the occupation fraction in dwarfs. If AGN in this BH
mass regime are conﬁrmed by other methods (e.g., vari-
ability, line broadening, X-rays), but still fail to show
any optical signatures, this non-detection would suggest
that the column density of obscuring gas and the cov-
ering factor around the source could be factors in the
elusive nature of these AGN. The column densities and
covering factors of dwarf AGN remain relatively unex-
plored. Purely star forming dwarf galaxies show a de-
crease in covering factor as metallicity decreases, albeit
with a large scatter in the relation (Cormier et al. 2019).
Conversely, massive galaxies show a decrease in obscured
AGN (large covering factor) with increasing luminosity
(Sazonov et al. 2015, Georgakakis et al. 2017), and there-
fore increasing metallicity (Lamareille et al. 2004). It is
possible that dwarf AGN could provide the missing link
between these two opposing trends if low mass IMBHs
continue to remain elusive in the optical.

In the mid-IR, we have shown that [Ar II] 6.98µm /
Pfα and [O IV] 25.9µm/Pfα together have the poten-
tial to constrain AGN activity over a range of galaxy
masses while minimizing sensitivity to physical uncer-
tainties (Figure 6). We have revised the demarcations
[O IV]/[Ne III] diagnostic
on the [Ne III]/[Ne II] vs.
diagram to include dwarf AGN and presented two new
diagnostic diagrams based on the [O IV] and [Ar II]
emission lines (Figure 9). These new diagrams are ca-
pable of separating starburst activity from AGN activity
down to a 4% AGN fraction in dwarfs, which are ubiq-
uitously star forming. Unlike the BPT diagram, these
proposed diagrams maintain their diagnostic value over
a wide range of ionization and metallicity.

We emphasize that the provided demarcations serve
as theoretical boundaries for classifying the excitation
mechanism in dwarf galaxies. Observations of optically
classiﬁed starbursts can occasionally cross over into the
AGN region of these diagrams due to strong mid-IR
[O IV] emission (e.g., IZw18, Lebouteiller et al. 2017),

APPENDIX

A. DEPLETION FACTORS DUE TO GRAINS

We use the methodology presented in Jenkins (2009) (hereafter J09) to develop a set of depletion factors that account
for gas phase elements condensing to form dust grains. This depletion depends on comparing a reference abundance
set to abundances derived from observations along a particular line of sight. The diﬀerence provides the depletion
factor, δX ,

δX = log

(cid:18) X
H

− log

obs
Despite the dependence on a reference set of abundances, most photoionization modeling does not properly take this
factor into account as shown below. Diﬀerent lines of sight yield diﬀerent depletion factors for a given element, allowing
one to deﬁne a depletion strength, F∗, that accounts for this variation. A linear ﬁt to the logarithm of the depletion
factor gives the following form,

ref

δX = BX + AX (F∗ − zX )

(A2)

where AX is the slope, BX is the vertical oﬀset, and zX accounts for the errors in the observations. We assume that
the non-refractory elements He, Ne, S, and Ar do not become depleted in the ISM. However, sulphur depletion remains
a subject of debate (Gry & Jenkins 2017, Laas & Caselli 2019, Goicoechea & Cuadrado 2021, Hily-Blant et al. 2021).
We use the ﬁts for the Galaxy provided in J09 for C, N, O, Mg, Si, P, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn. We make
this choice for two reasons. First, J09 provides the most complete sample, while extragalactic ﬁts are mostly limited
to heavier elements that have less impact on emission line predictions. Second, the number of observations included
in the J09 analysis makes the ﬁt more reliable.

While we assume that depletion occurs as observed in the Milky Way, deviations in the depletion patterns for heavy
elements are known to be present for other galaxies. For example, Mg, Ti, and Mn show noticeable deviations in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (Jenkins & Wallerstein 2017), and while the depletion pattern is mostly Galactic in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (Tchernyshyov et al. 2015), Si does show a noticeable deviation (Roman-Duval et al. 2019).

For the rest of the elements, we have compiled a list of depletion factors towards the highly depleted star ζ Oph
to serve as the value at F∗ = 1.0 in accordance with the method used by J09. Fluorine is the only exception where
we use the most depleted source in Snow et al. (2007), since the value towards ζ Oph is unavailable. To determine
the parameters AX and BX for these elements, we rely on the general trend that elements with larger condensation
temperatures show greater depletions and steeper slopes. The following elements have similar depletion trends to their
J09 counterparts: Li ⇔ Cr; Be ⇔ Mg; B ⇔ Zn, F ⇔ Cl; Na, K ⇔ Cu, Zn; Al, Ca, V ⇔ Ti; Sc ⇔ P, Cu; Co ⇔ Ni.
From these analogies, we can assume that all of the elements in J09 have δX = 0 at F∗ ≈ −0.5 except for δFluorine,
which reaches zero at F∗ = 0.2.

Table 2 lists the depletion factors for all elements for F∗ = 1.0, the linear ﬁt parameters need to recreate the depletion
pattern, and the reference for each depletion factor given. Note that depletion factors have been rescaled according
to our reference abundances instead of using the abundance assumed in each cited source. Displaying the depletion
factors for F∗ = 1.0 makes it clear which elements are weakly depleted in the ISM as opposed to not depleted at all.
However, for our photoionization modeling, we adjusted F∗ so that δFe = −1.5 (see Table 1), which we justiﬁed in
§2.2.

The methodology we have used here is similar to what resulted in the depletion factor sets included with the
photoionization code Mappings V (Sutherland & Dopita 2017) with two major diﬀerences. First, unlike the values
included with Mappings, our depletion factors are self-consistently scaled with our reference abundances. Second, we
do not deplete nitrogen for any value of F∗ given the lack of evidence that nitrogen gets locked up in grains. This is
particularly important for any analysis that strongly relies upon nitrogen emission lines for inferring metallicity values.
The depletion factors we use represent a small step toward accounting for the diﬀerent depletion patterns in gas
phase abundances, much in the same way Nicholls et al. (2017) accounts for nucleosynthesis patterns for elements as a
function of metallicity. However, obvious limitations exist since galaxies can show more negative F∗ than we account
for here (Jenkins & Wallerstein 2017).

B. ADDITIONAL LINE RATIO SENSITIVITY DIAGRAMS

In this section, we present the line ratio sensitivity for additional AGN diagnostics. Figures 10 and 11 display
diagnostics in the optical for MBH = 103 M(cid:12) and MBH = 105 M(cid:12), respectively, and similarly in the mid-IR for
Figures 12 and 13. The columns of each ﬁgure represent a given galaxy mass, while the rows represent a given line
ratio. As with the diagnostics presented in the main body of the paper, the uncertainty introduced from the AGN
SED shape, cloud geometry, and mixing methodology, decreases at higher black hole mass.

In the optical, most of the emission line ratios poorly trace fAGN. It is noteworthy that [N II]/Hα remains relatively
insensitive to AGN activity in most conditions, which combined with the line ratio’s metallicity sensitivity makes
it an overall poor diagnostic for dwarf AGN. In contrast, He II/Hβ and [O I]/[O III] are promising diagnostics for
dwarf AGN. However, the wind from WR stars can contaminate He II (Brinchmann et al. 2008), therefore line ratios
involving [O I] are more reliable.

In the mid-IR, one also needs to be judicious in selecting AGN sensitive diagnostics. For a 103 M(cid:12) black hole,
[Ar V]/Pfα, [Ar V]/[Ar III], and [O IV]/[Ne II] suﬀer from large amounts of uncertainty for most galaxy masses
regimes.
In contrast, [O IV]/[S III] and [Ar II]/[Ar III] provide suitable backups for [O IV]/Pfα and [Ar II]/Pfα
(Figures 6 and 7) across the black hole masses and galaxy masses we have considered.
