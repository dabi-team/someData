Abstract 

We report the growth of thickness-controlled rotationally faulted multilayer graphene (rf-MLG) 

on Ni foils by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and their characterization by micro-Raman 

spectroscopy.  The  surface  morphology  and  thickness  were  investigated  by  scanning  electron 

microscope, X-ray diffraction, and transmittance measurements. These results have revealed that 

the thickness of rf-MLG can be effectively controlled by the thickness of the Ni foil rather than 

the flow rate of CH4, H2, Ar. In the Raman spectroscopy measurements, we observed most Raman 

peaks of the graphitic materials. Raman spectra can be categorized into four patterns and show 
systematic behaviors. Especially, the in-plane (ÔÅæ1880 cm-1, ÔÅæ2035 cm-1) and out-of-plane (ÔÅæ1750 
cm-1) modes are successfully analyzed to explain the dimensionality of rf-MLG as in the twisted 
(or rotated) bilayer graphene. In addition, it is found that the two peaks at ÔÅæ1230 cm-1 and ÔÅæ2220 
cm-1 well reflect the properties of the in-plane mode. The peak intensities of the above four in-

plane modes are proportional to that of 2D band, indicating that they share the common Raman 

resonance process.

1. Introduction 

Graphene  has  been  much  attracted  in  both  fundamental  science  and  application  due  to 

outstanding  electrical  and  optical  properties,  which  come  from  the  typical  electronic  band 

structure, the so-called Dirac-cone [1, 2, 3]. In graphene, electrons behave like massless particles 

with  charge  and  spin  owing  to  the  linearly  dispersive  electric  band  near  the  Fermi  level  [4]. 

Particularly,  its  high  carrier  mobility  and  absorption  coefficient  have  been  expected  to  make 

graphene the substitution for silicon in the opto-electronic devices [5]. However, to this end, there 

are some problems we have to resolve. When two single-layer graphenes (SLGs) are stacked and 

form bilayer graphene (BLG), the above outstanding properties are reduced by the deformation 

of  the  Dirac-cone.  As  the  layer  number  increases,  the  three-dimensional  properties  become 

stronger, and graphene eventually changes into graphite. In general, it has been accepted that the 

Bernal  (AB-)  stacking  more  than  ÔÅæ10  graphene  layers  gives  rise  to  the  graphitization  [6]. 

Fortunately, it has been recently reported that the rotational stacking can dramatically improve 

the  physical  properties  of  graphene  [7,  8].  These  have  been  intensively  studied  by  Raman 

spectroscopy, which is one of the most powerful methods to prove both the vibration and electric 

band structure [9, 10, 11]. Kim et al., reported that the twisted (or rotated) BLG (tBLG), stacked 

rotationally  by  larger  than  14  ÔÇ∞,  shows  the  SLG-like  Raman  spectra  [8].  In  addition,  such 

phenomena have observed in rotationally faulted (rf-) multi-layer graphene (MLG) [12, 13, 14]. 

In order to facilitate these excellent properties, it is important to fabricate the thickness-controlled 

rf-MLG in high-quality and to establish the reliable characterization methods. In this paper, we 

present the growth of the thickness-controlled rf-MLG on the Ni foil by chemical vapor deposition 

(CVD) and its characterization by micro-Raman spectroscopy. 

2. Experimental 

rf-MLGs were grown on Ni foils by the low-pressure CVD. In order to control the thickness of 

rf-MLG, we used two different sets of the flow rates (50, 10, 100 sccm and 400, 10, 160 sccm for 

CH4, H2, Ar) and two different thicknesses of Ni foil (10, 50 ÔÅ≠m) as in table 1. And the sample 

number is denoted by the growth conditions. The mixed gas was introduced into the CVD quartz 
chamber for 7 minutes in the vacuum of ÔÅæ10-1 Torr, following the annealing of the Ni substrate at 
1000 ¬∞C for 1 hour in the vacuum of ÔÅæ10-6 Torr without gas flow. The sample was cooled down 

to room temperature by full-open of the furnace, retaining Ar flowing. Surface morphology of rf-

MLG was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images acquired by JSM-7000F 

(JEOL Ltd.). Thickness of rf-MLG was estimated by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) 

and  transmittance  measurements  by  using  Miniflex600  (Rigaku  Ltd.)  and  home-built  optical 

instruments equipped with CS260 monochromator (Oriel Ltd.), respectively. For transmittance 

measurements,  rf-MLGs  were  transferred  onto  the glass  substrate  by  the  conventional  process 

2 

 
 
with assistance of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The rf-MLGs, grown on the Ni foil, 

were  characterized  by  confocal  micro-Raman  spectrometer  (NRS-5100,  Japan  optics  Ltd.) 

equipped with the 532 nm laser whose spot size is under 1 ÔÅ≠m and the spectrograph with the focal 

length of 300 mm. We used  the grating of 600  lines/mm to obtain Raman spectra in the wide 

range, simultaneously. 

3. Results and Discussion 

Figure  1(a)  and  1(b)  are  the  SEM  images  of  rf-MLGs  (No.1ÔÄ≠No.4)  at  800ÔÇ¥  and  10000ÔÇ¥ 

magnifications,  respectively. We  can  recognize  that  grains  and  white  wrinkles  are  of  different 

sizes in each sample. In the left images of rf-MLGs (No.1, No.3) grown on the Ni foil of 10 ÔÅ≠m 

(Ni10ÔÅ≠m), the grains are as large as several tens ÔÅ≠m and distinct, while the wrinkles are very thin 

and cannot be seen well at 800ÔÇ¥ magnification (Fig. 1(a)). The right images of rf-MLGs (No.2, 

No.4) on the Ni foil of 50 ÔÅ≠m (Ni50ÔÅ≠m) show that grains are several times larger than those of rf-

MLG on Ni10ÔÅ≠m, and the wrinkles are relatively thicker and are clearly observed over the grains. 

On the other hand, the upper (No.1, No.2) and the lower (No.3, No.4) images correspond to the 

surface of the rf-MLGs fabricated with the CH4 of 50 sccm and 400 sccm, respectively (see the 

table 1). The wrinkle is clearer in No.4 than in No.2 in spite of the similar morphology. In Fig. 

1(b), we can also observe the wrinkles on the surface of rf-MLG on Ni10ÔÅ≠m (No.1, No.3) at 10000ÔÇ¥ 

magnification. In addition, there are white spots in No.1 and No.3. Such spots have often been 

observed  in  a  graphene  grown  by  CVD  and  are  usually  considered  to  be  impurities  from  the 

substrate of metal catalyst. This implies that the sample surfaces of rf-MLG on Ni10ÔÅ≠m are thinner 

than those of rf-MLG on Ni50ÔÅ≠m. The area surrounded by the wrinkle is larger and flatter in No.2 

and  No.4  than  in  No.1  and  No.3.  From  the  above  results,  the  surface  becomes  flatter  and  the 

wrinkle is clearer as rf-MLG is getting thicker, that is, the layer number increases. 

In  order  to  investigate  the  crystallinity  and  the  thickness  of  rf-MLG,  the  XRD  and  optical 

transmittance measurements were carried out. Figure 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of rf-MLGs 

(No.1ÔÄ≠No.4). We observe a dramatic change of the peak intensity caused by the thickness of rf-

MLG. There are typical graphite (002) peak at ~26.4 ÔÇ∞ and Ni (200) peak at ~51.7 ÔÇ∞ with strong 

intensity, and graphite (004) peak at ~54.5 ÔÇ∞ and Ni (111) peak at ~44.4 ÔÇ∞ with weak intensity. The 

existence of the graphite peaks indicates that the rf-MLG grown on Ni foil have been well stacked 

along the perpendicular direction to the surface plane. In No.1 and No.3, the intensity of graphite 

(002) peak is very weak compared to that of the Ni (200) peak. On the other hand, the graphite 

(002)  peak  is  much  larger  than  the  Ni  (200)  peak  in  No.2  and  No.4.  These  indicate  that  the 

thickness of rf-MLG on Ni10ÔÅ≠m is much thinner than that of rf-MLG on Ni50ÔÅ≠m. Figure 2(b) shows 

the  optical  transmittance  spectra  of  rf-MLGs  (No.1ÔÄ≠No.4)  at  normal  incidence.  All  spectra 

3 

 
 
 
increase with the wavelength of the incident light, showing the typical transmittance of MLG [5, 

16]. Due to the stacking of a large number of graphene layers, transmittance is very low, compared 

to that of SLG. At 550 nm, the transmittances are ~13.6 % (No.1), ~2.2 % (No.2), ~13.5 % (No.3), 

and ~1.2 % (No.4). It is well known that SLG exhibits the optical absorption of ~2.3 % which is 

determined by the fine-structure constant due to interactions between the Dirac electron and the 

photon  [16].  Moreover,  the  absorption  of  a  few-layer  graphene  (FLG)  is  proportional  to  the 

number  of  graphene  layers  due  to  the  weak  bonding  (van  der  Waals  interaction)  between  the 

graphene  layers.  The  optical  transmittance  of  MLG  has  demonstrated  by  considering  the 

interlayer hopping and different stacking order. It has been reported that the optical transmittance 

is  not  dependent  on  the  stacking  orders  (AB-  and ABC-stacking)  and  show  good  agreement 

between the numerical simulation and the experimental data [15]. Therefore, we employed the 

above method to estimate the thickness of rf-MLG by considering the independent stacking order 

and the weak van der Waals interaction of rf-MLG. The inset is the plot of the relation between 

layers  and 

the  number  of 
the  equation  T =
(1 + 1.13ùúãùõºùëÅ 2‚ÅÑ )‚àí2  (N is the number of graphene layer, and 1.13 is a correction coefficient for 
the deviation from the universal optical conductance (e2 4‚Ñè‚ÅÑ

)) [15]. The number of layers of No.1 

transmittance  at  550  nm,  using 

the 

and No.4 are estimated to be 132 and 634, respectively, which correspond to the thickness of ~44 

nm  and  ~212  nm,  respectively.  From  the  above  results  of  the  SEM,  XRD  and  transmittance 

measurements, we can conclude that the thickness of rf-MLG can be controlled effectively by the 

thickness of the Ni foil catalyst rather than the flow rate of CH4, H2, Ar. 

Next, let us characterize the Raman spectra of the fabricated rf-MLGs. Figure 3(a) shows the 

representative Raman spectrum of rf-MLG on Ni foil (No.1, Pattern I in Fig. 4(a)). We observe 
two typical G and 2D Raman bands at ~1580 and ~2700 cm-1, respectively. The G band has been 

assigned to the degeneracy of the in-plane transverse optic (TO) and the longitudinal optic (LO) 

phonon  modes  around  the  Œì-point  (E2g  symmetry).  The  2D  band  has  been  considered  to  be 

associated with the second-order Raman scattering involving the TO phonon mode around the K-

point (breathing vibration). It has been well known that the 2D band is largely enhanced by the 

double-resonance process in SLG compared to other graphitic materials. Therefore, the intensity 

ratio of the G and 2D bands (I2D/IG) has facilitated the estimation of the number of graphene layers. 

In  general,  I2D/IG  larger  than  2  has  been  considered  as  an  indication  of  SLG.  In  Fig.  3(a),  the 

observed  Raman  spectrum  reveals  I2D/IG  ~  3.7,  showing  the  SLG-like  behavior.  However,  the 

fabricated rf-MLG has the thickness of ~44 nm and the number of layers is about 132 as shown 

in  Fig.  2.  Such  behaviors  have  been  reported  in  rf-MLG,  and  a  possible  mechanism  has  been 

suggested: the rotational stacking of the graphene layers causes the weakness of the van der Waals 

bonding between the graphene layers, and then the 2-dimensional  properties become stronger, 

4 

 
 
showing the SLG-like behavior [25, 26]. Beyond the above two main peaks, we observe the small 
D band around 1350 cm-1, which originates from defects. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands 

(ID/IG) is ~0.04, indicating that the fabricated rf-MLG is of high quality. In the enlarged plot (Fig. 
3(b)),  we  can  observe  most  of  the  overtone  and  combination  modes  allowed  in  sp2-carbon 

materials as listed in table 2 [9, 10]. Here, we will confine our interest to the specific peaks to 
discuss the obtained Raman spectra. The P4 (1500 cm-1) and P6 (1680  cm-1) peaks are located 
around the G band. From the previous reports, P4 consists of the R (TO) mode around 1430 cm-1 
[7] and the LO-ZO‚Ä≤ mode around 1520 cm-1 [17, 18]. And, the P6 peak includes the three modes; 
the D‚Ä≤ peak (LO) around 1620 cm-1, the R‚Ä≤ (LO) peak around 1625 cm-1, the LO+ZO‚Ä≤ mode around 
1720  cm-1  [17,  18].  Recently,  in  twisted  graphene  heterostructures,  the  R  and  R‚Ä≤  peaks  were 

identified as Te (TO mode of inter-layer Raman scattering) and La (LO mode of intra-layer Raman 

scattering), respectively [27]. Contribution of the D‚Ä≤ peak to the P6 peak is very small because of 

the high-quality of the fabricated rf-MLG (very small intensity of D peak). In particular, the R 

and R‚Ä≤ peaks are related to the rotational stacking of the graphene layers in tBLG [7, 12, 13, 28]. 

The observed R and R‚Ä≤ peaks in rf-MLG are not clear comparing to those of tBLG, which may 

come from a large number of stacking with the different angles. We will discuss more about the 
R peak in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The P7 peak at ~1750 cm-1 is the overtone of ZO mode (2ZO) and 

usually  assigned  by  the  M  band,  which  have  information  about  the  interaction  between  the 

graphene layers along the direction of the out-of-plane [20]. Here, it should be also noted that the 

M band is the infrared (IR) active and not shown in both SLG and tBLG [21]. In rf-MLG, the 

observation of the IR active peak indicates that the stacking along the out-of-plane is different 

from the usual AB- and ABC-stacking. Cong et al. have reported the M band can be Raman active 
by loosing the selection rule due to the rotational stacking [21]. The P8 (~1880 cm-1) and P9 (~2035 
cm-1)  peaks  are  combination  of  the  in-plane  modes,  and  are  assigned  to  LO+TA  and  LO+LA, 

respectively  [19,  21,  22,  23].  These  peaks  have  been  considered  to  come  from  the  double 

resonance Raman process and used as indications of the two-dimensionality of the graphene. 

Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra of No.1 in the range of 1170ÔÄ≠2270 cm-1, which are normalized 

to IG after the background subtraction of a constant value. They can be categorized by the four 

patterns as follows: (Pattern I) I2D/IG is greater than two; (Pattern II) I2D/IG is slightly greater than 

one and less than two; (Pattern III) I2D/IG is slightly less than one; (Pattern IV) I2D/IG is much less 

than one. In the inset, the Raman spectra of the 2D band were plotted using the y-axis of I2D/IG. 

As the pattern changes from I to IV, I2D/IG decreases accompanying the variation of peak structure. 
In the pattern I, the 2D band is a single intense peak at ~2700 cm-1. On the other hand, the 2D 
band exhibits the multi-peak structure with two main intensities at ~2700 cm-1 and ~2720 cm-1 in 

the patterns IIÔÄ≠IV. As the pattern changes from II to IV, the spectral weight shifts from the low 

5 

 
 
frequency  (~2700  cm-1)  to  the  high  frequency  mode  (~2720  cm-1).  These  behaviors  are  very 

similar to the variation of the Raman spectra as the number of the graphene layer increases from 

monolayer  to  multilayer  in  the  Bernal  (AB-)  stacking  [6].  Moreover,  we  clearly  observe  the 

systematic variation of the out-of-plane (P7) and in-plane (P8, P9) modes. With increasing I2D/IG, 

the in-plane peaks increase but the out-of-plane peak decreases oppositely. This is consistent with 

the previous reports on the tBLG and rf-MLG where the comparison of I2D and IG has successfully 

accounted  for  the  dimensionality  of  the  electronic  properties  [13,  21,  23].  In  addition,  we  can 
recognize  that  the  P2  (~1230  cm-1)  and  P10  (~2220  cm-1)  peaks  are  also  getting  intensive  with 

increasing I2D/IG, showing the similar behavior with the in-plane peaks (P8, P9). This means that 

the P2 and P10 peaks can be assigned to the in-plane modes. Actually, P10 has been considered to 

be the combination mode of TO+TA in tBLG [22, 23]. It should be also noted that the observed 

behavior of the P10 peak is different from the few-layer graphene of the Bernal (AB-) stacking, 

where the P10 peak little varies [23]. When we consider the phonon dispersion of graphene [29, 
30], the most possible mode, which corresponds to the peak frequency of P2 (~1230 cm-1), is the 

TO mode near K-point. Therefore, we tentatively assign P2 to TO. Further studies are needed to 

clarify its Raman process. 

Here, we should discuss about the relation between I2D/IG and the rotational angle, too. It is well 

known  that  I2D/IG  depends  on  the  rotational  angle  between  the  inter-layers  of  the  graphene  in 

tBLG: I2D/IG is close to that of SLG as the rotational angle is larger than ~14 ¬∞ [8]. However, in 

rf-MLG, it is difficult to determine the rotational angle from I2D/IG, because of the large number 

of layers. From the similarity behaviors of the in- and out-of-planes between rf-MLG and tBLG, 

we can infer that the graphene layers are stacked by the weak van der Waals interaction, and the 

rotations of the top layers play an important role to determine the variation of I2D/IG. 

Figure 5 shows the Raman spectra of No.1ÔÄ≠No.4 by pattern, i.e. (a)(b) pattern I, (c)(d) pattern 

II, (e)(f) pattern III, and (g)(h) pattern IV. The left and right sides of Fig. 5 are the Raman spectra 

in the normal and enlarged scales, respectively. The Raman spectra of pattern I for all types of the 

sample (No.1ÔÄ≠No.4) are displayed in Fig. 5(a). Their I2D/IGs are about 2.3ÔÄ≠9.8, showing the SLG-
like behavior. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 2D band is from ~26 to ~38 cm-1, 

which are comparable to those of SLG. In this scale, ID is very small and is not clearly seen in all 

samples, indicating little defects. Figure 5(b) shows the enlarged Raman spectra of the pattern I 
in the range of 1170ÔÄ≠2270 cm-1. It is found that the D bands of No.1ÔÄ≠No.4 at ~1350 cm-1 are of 
the similar intensity, indicating the similar sample quality. There is the small P2 at ~1230 cm-1, 

which is slightly larger in the No.2 and No.3 samples than in No.1 and No.4. This seems to be 

correlated with the fact that the I2D/IG values are also larger in No.2 and No.3 than in No.1 and 

No.4. As mentioned in Fig. 4, the R peak near the G band reveals the rotational stacking of the 

6 

 
 
adjacent graphene layers to each other. The R peak at ~1453 cm-1 in No.4 is especially sharper 

comparing with that of the other samples. The R peak of No.2 is also clear but is located at the 
higher frequency (~1470 cm-1) than that of No.4. It has been reported that the R peak is shifted to 

the lower frequency as the rotation angle increases [7, 28]. Therefore, it is expected that graphene 

layers near the top in No.4 are stacked by larger angle than those in No.2. In No.1 and No.3, the 
R modes appear as the shoulder at ~1470 cm-1. Moreover, the small out-of-plane mode (P7) and 

the large in-plane modes (P8, P9) indicate strong interactions in the in-plane of rf-MLG, i.e. the 

good two-dimensionality. 

Figure 5(c) and 5(d) show the Raman spectra of the pattern II. It is found that the average FWHM 
of the 2D band is ~47 cm-1 and is a little larger than that in the pattern I, indicating the increase 

of the band width of the Dirac-cone. Comparing with the pattern I, the prominent different point 

is the increase of the out-of-plane mode and the decrease of the in-plane modes, indicating the 

increase of the hybridization between the graphene layers. In addition, in Fig. 5(e), 5(f), 5(h) and 

5(i),  we  find  that,  in  the  pattern  III  and  IV,  the  in-plane  peaks  decrease  and  the  out-of-plane 

increases, more and more. From the above results, we can safely conclude that the comparison of 

the in-plane and out-of-plane modes still plays an important role to estimate the two-dimensional 

properties in rf-MLGs of the different thickness. This means that the thickness does not affect the 

two-dimensional  properties  in  rf-MLG.  The  D  band  also  shows  systematic  variations. As  the 

pattern  changes  from  I  to  II  and  III,  the  intensity  of  the  D  band  decreases  and,  eventually 

disappears in the pattern IV. This implies that the rotational stacking of graphene layers causes 

deformations of the honeycomb crystal structure of graphene. 

Figure 6 shows the variation of the in-plane (P2, P8, P9, P10), out-of-plane (P7) modes, and the 

2D band (P13) in the pattern I for No.1ÔÄ≠No.4. In Fig. 6(a), the left y-axis is the peak intensity of 

the in-plane and out-of-plane modes (IIN,OUT), and the right y-axis is that of the 2D band. All peaks 

were normalized to the intensity of the G band. As discussed in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the four in-plane 

modes show a similar tendency with the 2D band, while the out-of-plane mode shows the opposite 

behavior to the in-plane and 2D peaks. In Fig. 6(b), the intensities of the peaks (y-axis) are plotted 

as a function of the intensity of the 2D band (x-axis). All peaks are proportional to the 2D band 

by the different slopes. In order to investigate the relation between the above peaks and the 2D 

band, we normalized all peaks to the own largest value. This clearly reveals that the intensities of 

the  in-plane  modes  are  scaled  to  that  of  the  2D  band,  indicating  they  share  the  common 

mechanism, i.e. the double resonance Raman process [9, 19].   

Finally, it is valuable to mention the distribution of each pattern in each sample. We measured 

the Raman  spectra over the sample as evenly as possible. While the over half  of the obtained 

spectra are pattern I or II in No.1, the less than 25 % of the spectra are pattern I or II in No.4.

4. Conclusions 

We  have  fabricated  rf-MLGs  on  Ni  foils  in  the  different  thickness  by  the  CVD  method,  and 

characterized them in detail by the Raman spectroscopy measurements. The surface morphology 

and  thickness  were  investigated  by  the  SEM,  XRD,  and  transmittance  measurements.  The 

obtained data showed that the thickness of rf-MLG can be effectively controlled by the thickness 

of  the  Ni  foil.  In  the  Raman  spectroscopy  measurements,  we  successfully  accounted  for  the 
dimensionality of rf-MLG by the analysis of the in-plane (P8, ~1880 cm-1; P9, ~2035 cm-1) and 
out-of-plane (P7, ~1750 cm-1) modes as in tBLG, in spite of many graphene layers and the different 
thickness. Here, we also attribute P2 (~1230 cm-1) and P10 (~2220 cm-1) to the in-plane modes due 

to the similar behavior of the typical in-plane modes (P8, P9). In addition, it is found that the peak 

intensities of the above four in-plane modes (P2, P8, P9, P10) are proportional to that of 2D band. 

This indicates that they share the common Raman resonance process. We believe that our growth 

method  of  the  thickness  controlled  rf-MLG  and  the  analysis  of  Raman  spectra  would  provide 

useful information for both the understanding of fundamental properties and applications.
