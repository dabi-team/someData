Abstract.  Recent  preliminary  results  on  multiplicity  fluctuations  in  p+p,  Be+Be  and  Ar+Sc 
collisions from the NA61/SHINE collaboration are presented. The scaled variance of charged 
hadron  multiplicity  changes  little  when  going  from  p+p  to  Be+Be  collisions  and  drops 
dramatically  from  Be+Be  to  Ar+Sc  interactions.  The  centrality  selection  procedure  and  the 
influence of volume fluctuations are discussed. Comparisons with the EPOS event generator are 
shown. 

1. Introduction  
This paper presents preliminary results on event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations in inelastic p+p and 
the most central Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions. The data were recorded by the NA61/SHINE experiment 
at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) as a part of the energy and system size scan program. 
This program aims to study the phase transition between hadron gas and quark gluon plasma in heavy 
ion collisions and to find the critical point. The expected signal of a critical point is a non-monotonic 
behavior of different fluctuation measures including multiplicity fluctuations [1]. 
The paper is organized as follows. In sec.2 two measures of multiplicity fluctuations are introduced: the 
scaled variance and the strongly intensive quantity Ω [2]. The event and centrality selection procedure 
is discussed in sec.3. The NA61/SHINE acceptance, track selection, uncertainties and corrections are 
described in sec.4 and sec.5. Results are presented in sec.6 and discussed in sec.7.  

2. Multiplicity and forward energy fluctuations 
The  most  common  way  to  measure  multiplicity  fluctuations  is  to  use  a  scaled  variance  ω  of  the 
distribution:  

ω N =

%& ’ % &
%

(1) 

where N is the multiplicity of charged particles in an event, and 
 denotes the averaging over events. 
The scaled variance is an intensive quantity which does not depend on the volume of the system within 
the grand canonical ensemble (GCE) of statistical mechanics or on the number of sources within models 
of independent sources like the wounded nucleon model (WNM). The scaled variance has the value zero 
if there are no multiplicity fluctuations and unity for a Poisson multiplicity distribution.  
Unfortunately, the volume of the system created in heavy ion collisions cannot be fixed and fluctuates 
a lot event by event. As the scaled variance depends on the fluctuations of the volume [3] the problem 
of reducing this effect becomes very important in fluctuation studies. Two different approaches were 
implemented to minimize the effect:  

	
	
	
	
	
	
 
 
 
• constrain  fluctuations  of  the  number  of  participating  nucleons  by  selecting  narrow  centrality 

classes. This will be discussed in the next section. 

• use strongly intensive quantities in the analysis, which by definition do not depend on volume 

fluctuations (in GCE and WNM) [2-3].   

The current analysis uses the strongly intensive quantity Ω A, B : 

Ω A, B = ω A −

,- ’ , -

It was shown in Ref. [2] that if A and B are uncorrelated from the fixed volume of the GCE or a single 
source in the WNM then Ω A, B  is equal to the scaled variance of the quantity A from the fixed volume 
(GCE) or a single source (WNM). To obey this condition A is selected as the multiplicity of produced 
particles and B as the projectile participant energy E/ = E0123 − E456, where Ebeam is the total beam 
energy and EPSD is the energy measured by the PSD, the NA61/SHINE hadron calorimeter positioned 
exactly on the beam line [4]. 

3. Event selection and centrality determination 
The crucial part of any fluctuation analysis is the centrality selection procedure. NA61/SHINE has a 
unique possibility as a fixed-target experiment to measure the total energy of non-interacting projectile 
nucleons as there is no need for a beam hole. In order to achieve this the hadron calorimeter PSD was 
placed on the beam line downstream of the Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). More information about 
NA61/SHINE detector systems can be found in Ref. [4]. The PSD detector consists of 44 independent 
modules. Selection of different sets of modules for each colliding system and energy allows to minimize 
the  impact  of  produced  particles  on  the  calorimeter  signal  and  maximize  the  contribution  from  non-
interacting projectile nucleon spectators.  
In order to reduce autocorrelation between multiplicity of charged particles used for fluctuation analysis 
and signals utilized for the centrality determination in the NA61/SHINE experiment, only the energy 
deposited in the PSD calorimeter is used for event selection. Event-by-event multiplicity measured by 
the TPCs does not take part in the procedure. 
The exact way of experimental centrality determination has a large effect on the multiplicity fluctuation 
measurement. Therefore, for a proper comparison between models and data, theoreticians have to repeat 
the experimental procedures as closely as possible, because quantities obtained with centrality selection 
based  on  multiplicity,  impact  parameter  or  forward  energy  may  differ  a  lot,  especially  for  light  and 
intermediate size nuclei such as Be and Ar. The NA61/SHINE centrality selection procedure is fully 
based on forward energy. To calculate this energy in a Monte-Carlo event generator the PSD acceptance 
maps  [5]  should  be  used.  Then  the  5%  of  the  events  with  the  lowest  energy  in  the  acceptance  will 
correspond to the NA61/SHINE results for 5% centrality selection. 

4. Track selection and acceptance  
Track selection criteria were chosen in a way to select only primary charged hadrons as well as to reduce 
the contamination from secondary interactions, weak decays and pile-up events. 
The multiplicity fluctuations strongly depend on the acceptance in which they are measured. Therefore, 
it  is  highly  important  for  any  model  comparison  to  use  the  same  acceptance.  The  NA61/SHINE 
acceptance maps can be found in Ref. [6]. Moreover, in the current paper only particles with transverse 
momenta p8 < 1.5	GeV/c and rapidity with pion mass assumption 0 < 𝑦E < y0123 were analysed.  

5. Statistical and systematic uncertainties, corrections 
Statistical  uncertainties  were  calculated  using  the  sub-sample  method.  Analysis  of  systematic 
uncertainties is not finished yet but they are expected to be smaller than 5%.  
Results for Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions presented below are not corrected for experimental biases. To 
minimize such biases only results for negatively charged hadrons are shown. Nevertheless, to estimate 

	
	
	
	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
the magnitudes of detector biases, an analysis of events generated by the EPOS event generator was 
performed  at  two  levels:  before  and  after  detector  response  simulated  with  the  GEANT  based 
NA61/SHINE program chain. A comparison of the results is shown in Fig. 1. The differences between 
results are much smaller than 5% except at the top energy where they are on the level of 5%. 
The p+p data is fully corrected for detector effects and off-target interactions. The procedure is described 
in detail in Ref. [7].

6. Results  
The  preliminary  results  shown  in  this  section  refer  to  accepted  primary  negatively  charged  hadrons 
produced in centrality selected Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions and in inelastic p+p interactions. 
The first observation is that the strongly intensive quantity Ω h’, E4  does not depend on the width of 
the centrality interval as expected, contrary to the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution (see 
Fig. 2). Both quantities converge to the same common limit for the most central collisions.

7. Conclusions 
New  measurements  of  multiplicity  fluctuations  were  performed  by  the  NA61/SHINE  experiment  at 
CERN SPS energies using the intensive quantity ω and the strongly intensive quantity Ω h’, E4 . These 
two measures converge to common limit for the most central collisions as expected. While ω increases 
with the size of the centrality interval, Ω h’, E4  does not change. Thus the strongly intensive quantity 
Ω better characterizes features of individual sources in heavy ion collisions.  
The suppression of multiplicity fluctuations in the most central Pb+Pb collisions compared to inelastic 
p+p reactions was previously noted in Ref. [7]. New results from Ar+Sc collisions confirm this effect 
for intermediate mass nuclei: the Ar+Sc result is much below that from p+p collisions.  
Unexpectedly,  the  light  nuclei  system  (Be+Be)  shows  behavior  very  similar  to  that  of  p+p,  while 
multiplicity fluctuations in Ar+Sc are suppressed. If this effect is due to different properties of particle 
sources in p+p and Be+Be versus Ar+Sc, it may be an indication of some type of transition in heavy ion 
collisions, namely, rapid change of hadron production properties when moving from the Be+Be to the 
Ar+Sc colliding system. The effect can be interpreted as the beginning of creation of large clusters of 
strongly  interacting  matter  and  may  be  explained  by  percolation  models  [8-12]  or  AdS/CFT 
correspondence [13]. This experimental phenomenon was referred to as the onset of fireball (by Edward 
Shuryak at the CPOD 2017 conference).
