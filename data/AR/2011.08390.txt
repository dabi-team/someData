Abstract 

Germanene, a two-dimensional honeycomb germanium crystal, is grown at graphene/Ag(111) 

and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/Ag(111) interfaces by segregating germanium atoms. A 

simple annealing process in N2 or H2/Ar at ambient pressure leads to the formation of 

germanene, indicating that an ultrahigh-vacuum condition is not necessary. The grown 

germanene is stable in air and uniform over the entire area covered with a van der Waals 

(vdW) material. As an important finding, it is necessary to use a vdW material as a cap layer 

for the present germanene growth method since the use of an Al2O3 cap layer resulted in no 

germanene formation. The present study also proved that Raman spectroscopy in air is a 

powerful tool for characterizing germanene at the interfaces, which is concluded by multiple 

analyses including first-principles density functional theory calculations. The direct growth of 

h-BN-capped germanene on Ag(111), which is demonstrated in the present study, is 

considered to be a promising technique for the fabrication of  future germanene-based 

electronic devices. 

1. Introduction 

Two-dimensional honeycomb lattices of group IV (group 14) elements, such as silicene,[1] 

germanene,[1c, 2] stanene,[3] and plumbene,[4] are known as Xenes[5]. On the basis of theoretical 

predictions, Xenes have electronic properties similar to those of graphene such as a Dirac cone 

with  linear  band  dispersion,  leading  to  an  extremely  high  carrier  mobility.[6]  In  contrast  to 

graphene,  the  crystal  structure of  Xenes  has  been  suggested  to  be  not  flat  but  buckled.  The 

buckled Xenes are expected to have a bandgap that can be tuned by applying a vertical electric 

field,[6]  which  can  overcome  the  problem  of  gapless  graphene  for  future  electronic  device 

applications. Thus, the utilization of Xenes in electronics is highly desirable. 

Xenes  have  been  grown  on  various  crystal  surfaces.  Germanene  has  been  grown  on 

Ag(111),[7]  Au(111),[2,  8]  Cu(111),[9]  Al(111),[10]  Pt(111),[11]  graphite,[12]  and  MoS2,[13]  and 

2 

 
 
 
 
silicene has been grown on Ag(111),[1a, 1b] Ag(110),[14] Al(111),[15] Ir(111),[16] ZrB2(0001),[17] 

and ZrC(111).[18] A limited number of reports of stanene growth on Ag(111)[3b] and Cu(111),[3a] 

as  well  as  one  report  of  plumbene  growth  on  a  Pd1−xPbx(111) alloy  film  on  Pd(111),[4a]  are 

available.  Although  the  growth  of  Xenes  has  been  widely  reported,  Xenes-based  electronic 

devices have not been reported, except for one silicene field-effect transistor (FET).[19] One of 

the  reasons  for  this  is  the  chemical  instability  of  Xenes,  in  contrast  to  the  stability  of 

graphene.[20] Although high-quality Xenes can be grown in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), they are 

expected to be immediately oxidized when removed from the UHV chamber.[21] Hence, for the 

realization of Xenes-based applications, we have to overcome this problem. 

As one approach, we conceived the direct growth of Xenes at interfaces. The oxidation of a 

Xene should be prevented by placing it at an interface that provides a spatial separation between 

Xenes  and  oxidizing  substances  in  air.  A  material  with  excellent  gas  barrier  properties  is 

required  to  form  such  an  interface.  In  this  paper,  we  report  a  novel  method  of  growing 

germanene  at  interfaces  between  van  der  Waals  (vdW)  materials  and  Ag(111).  Since  vdW 

materials,  such  as  graphene  and  hexagonal  boron  nitride  (h-BN),  have  excellent  gas  barrier 

properties,[22] they were used as a cap layer to form an interface for germanene growth. The 

proposed method of growing germanene is schematically drawn in Figure 1. First, graphene or 

h-BN was transferred onto a Ag(111) thin film formed on Ge(111). To induce Ge segregation 

at  the  vdW  material/Ag(111)  interface,  the  sample  was  annealed  in  N2  or  H2/Ar  (H2 

concentration ~ 3%)  ambient at atmospheric pressure. To  characterize the  germanene at the 

interface, Raman spectroscopy in air and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and 

density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations were performed, and the two Raman 

peaks observed at ~155 and ~255 cm-1 were assigned as out-of-plane and in-plane vibration 

modes  of  germanene,  respectively.  As  a  result,  it  was  revealed  that  germanene  was  grown 

uniformly under the vdW material and was stable in air as expected. One of our key findings is 

that the germanene growth method requires a vdW material as a cap layer since the use of an 

3 

 
 
 
Al2O3 cap layer resulted in the absence of germanene formation. To the best of our knowledge, 

this is the first report of the growth of a Xene at ambient pressure, which is beneficial from the 

viewpoint of reducing the cost of mass-producing future electronic devices based on germanene, 

as an alternative to conventional UHV growth.

characterization by Raman spectroscopy in air. 

2. Results and Discussion 

Figure  2  shows  Raman  spectra  of  graphene/Ag(111)/Ge(111)  after  annealing  at  room 

temperature (RT), 550, and 700 ºC, and the Raman spectrum of Ag(111)/Ge(111) without top 

graphene after annealing at 550 ºC. The top graphene was placed on the Ag surface by the wet 

transfer  of  chemical  vapor  deposition  (CVD)  graphene.  It  was  found  that  two  new  peaks 

appeared around 155 and 255 cm-1 after heating at 550 ºC (Figure 2b) as well as after heating 

at 450, 500, and 600 ºC (Figure S1). The two peaks did not appear in the case without the top 

graphene (Figure 2c). On the other hand, a sharp peak at 300 cm-1, which corresponds to the 

Ge-Ge vibration mode of bulk Ge, was observed in the sample heated to 700 ºC (Figure 2d). 

This was caused by the surface exposure of Ge(111) due to the disappearance of the Ag layer.[23] 

The disappearance of the Ag layer was due to its phase transition to a liquid and, as a result, 

most  of the  Ag  diffused  into  the bulk  Ge.  This  is  reasonable because 700  ºC  is  sufficiently 

higher than the eutectic melting point of the Ag-Ge system (~ 650 ºC).[24] Note that the Raman 

peaks observed around 155 and 255 cm-1 are different from the Ge-Ge vibration mode observed 

in bulk Ge.

and (d) 700 ºC, and (c) Raman spectrum of Ag(111)/Ge(111) without graphene after annealing 

at  550  ºC.  The  top  graphene  was  placed  onto  the  Ag  surface  by  the  wet  transfer  of  CVD 

graphene. The inset shows the areas where the spectra were obtained. 

The graphene/Ag(111)/Ge(111) sample annealed at 550 ºC with two new Raman peaks was 

characterized  by  angle-resolved  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  to  reveal  the 

distribution  of  elements  in  the  vicinity  of  its  surface.  Figure  3a  shows  the  XPS  spectrum 

obtained at  a photoelectron detection  angle of 45º. Carbon, sulfur, oxygen, germanium,  and 

silver were detected. Figure 3b shows the atomic concentration of each element as a function 

of  the  photoelectron  detection  angle.  The  concentrations  of  carbon,  sulfur,  and  oxygen 

increased  and  that  of  silver  decreased  with  increasing  detection  angle.  The  maximum 

concentration  of  Ge  was  observed  at  45º.  Since  XPS  with  a  larger  detection  angle  is  more 

sensitive  to  the  surface,  the  mountain-like  behavior  of  the  Ge  atomic  concentration  graph 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
(Figure 3b) indicates that Ge atoms were located at the interface between graphene and Ag(111). 

The  detected  sulfur  was  thought  to  be  mainly  derived  from  impurities  adsorbed  on  the  Ag 

surface before the transfer of graphene. Figure 3c shows the Ge 3d peak obtained at 45º with 

high energy resolution. Elemental Ge is the main component (29. 6 eV) and the minor peak 

originates from oxides of Ge (32.6 eV). This oxide formation may have been due to oxidation 

in the region uncovered with graphene (where bare Ge surface was exposed) and the diffusion 

of oxygen from graphene edges or defects. These results suggest that a crystal composed of 

elemental Ge that exhibits the newly observed Raman peaks can exist at the interface between 

graphene and Ag(111).

concentration  of  each  element  as  a  function  of  the  photoelectron  detection  angle.  The  inset 

shows the definition of the detection angle. (c) Ge 3d peak obtained at 45º with high energy 

resolution. The annealed sample was kept in air for more than 42 days before introducing it into 

the XPS chamber. 

To  assign  the  new  Raman  peaks  at  155  and  255  cm-1  (Figure  2b),  first-principles  DFPT 

calculations were performed. We only focused on monolayer germanene since cross-sectional 

scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observation indicated that the segregated 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Ge at the interface is likely to be monolayer not multilayer (Figure S2). Figure 4a and Figure 

4b show the calculated phonon dispersions of bulk Ge and freestanding germanene, respectively, 

and Figure 4c shows an illustration of the Raman active vibration modes in germanene obtained 

by vibration analysis. Raman active phonons are basically located at the gamma point, except 

in special Raman processes such as double resonance Raman scattering in graphene.[25] Thus, 

bulk Ge and germanene have one and two Raman active phonons, respectively, which has also 

been reported elsewhere.[26] This feature explains the experimental Raman spectra in Figure 2. 

Bulk Ge has only one peak at 300 cm-1 (Figure 2d), while germanene has two peaks at 155 and 

255 cm-1 for out-of-plane and in-plane vibration modes, respectively. 

The  experimentally  observed  phonon  for  the in-plane  mode  of  germanene  was  ~  45  cm-1 

lower than  that  of  bulk  Ge.  It  seems  that  the experimentally  observed  germanene  peaks  are 

redshifted from the freestanding germanene peaks since the calculated phonon energies of bulk 

Ge and the in-plane mode in freestanding germanene are almost the same (Figure 4a and Figure 

4b). The energy shift of the phonon is caused by the change in bond length, which is generally 

induced  by  strain  and  charge  transfer  to  the  lattice.  In  the  present  case,  rather  than  the  top 

graphene, Ag(111) is considered to contribute to phonon energy shifts since the naked Ag(111) 

surface is chemically reactive. 

To consider the redshift, we first examined the effect of strain on freestanding germanene. 

Figure 4d shows the phonon energies of the in-plane and out-of-plane modes and the Ge-Ge 

bond length in freestanding germanene as a function of in-plane biaxial strain. It is clear that 

tensile strain reduces the phonon energies for both modes and increases the Ge-Ge bond length. 

Subsequently,  we calculated  a  possible  lattice  structure of  germanene  on  a  Ag(111)  (7  ×  7) 

surface. The DFT calculations yield buckled hexagonal germanene on a Ag(111) (7 × 7) surface 

as shown in the top and side views in Figure 4e and Figure 4f, respectively. By extracting the 

coordinates  of  Ge  atoms,  the  average  Ge-Ge  bond  length  was  obtained  as  ~  2.49  Å.  which 

corresponds to slightly tensile freestanding germanene (~ 3%). Since the corresponding phonon 

7 

 
 
 
energies are ~165 and ~ 260 cm-1 for the out-of-plane and in-plane modes, respectively, the 

strain  induced  by  the  Ag(111)  surface  is  mainly  responsible  for  the  redshift.  Although  we 

cannot yet give a complete quantitative discussion, the above explanation may provide helpful 

ideas for explaining the observed Raman peaks of germanene at the graphene/Ag(111) interface.

layer Ag(111). Structural optimization was carried out with movable Ge and Ag atoms in the 

first surface layer and fixed Ag bulk positional atoms in the second to fourth surface layers. The 

average Ge-Ge bond length in germanene on Ag(111) was ~ 2.49 Å. 

To double-check that the observed Raman peaks were really derived from germanene, we 

grew germanene in a UHV chamber using the well-known surface segregation method reported 

by Yuhara et al.[7a] The phonon energies of germanene were measured by in situ high-resolution 

electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and ex situ Raman spectroscopy as illustrated in 

Figure 5a. First, Ge was cleaned by Kr+ sputtering and annealing at 700 ºC, resulting in a c(2 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
× 8) reconstructed surface.[27] Ag was deposited at RT on the cleaned Ge by vacuum evaporation 

to form a Ag(111) epitaxial layer. Germanene surface segregation was induced by heating at 

450 ºC for 10 min. The HREELS of germanene was performed in UHV to exclude the effects 

of impurities, such as oxygen, sulfur, and carbon. Subsequently, an amorphous boron (a-B) thin 

film was deposited at RT to protect the germanene from oxidation in air. Noted that the a-B 

deposition is our original idea, which has not been included in Ref. 12. The thickness of the a-

B film was estimated to be about 2 nm from the signal decay of Ag and Ge observed by Auger 

electron spectroscopy (AES) upon a-B deposition. After that, the sample was removed from the 

UHV chamber and examined by Raman spectroscopy in air. The Raman spectra were recorded 

within 3 h of removing the sample from the UHV chamber. 

Figure 5b shows the AES spectrum after the segregation growth of germanene. Only Ag and 

Ge were detected on the surface, indicating an impurity-free surface. Figure 5c and Figure 5d 

show  reflection  high-energy  electron  diffraction  (RHEED)  patterns  of  Ag(111)  and 

germanene/Ag(111),  respectively,  with  the [112(cid:3364)0] azimuth.  Two  types  of  streaks  (inner  and 

outer) appeared in the RHEED pattern of germanene (Figure 5d), in addition to the fundamental 

streaks of Ag(111) (Figure 5c). The inner streak (indicated by the white arrows in Figure 5d) 

corresponds to germanene with a lattice constant of ~ 3.89 Å at the rotation angle of 30º, which 

is in good agreement with that reported for germanene on Ag(111).[7a] The outer faint streak is 

caused by multiple diffractions by the Ag(111) lattice and germanene.  

Figure 5e shows the Raman spectrum of the boron-coated germanene on Ag(111) recorded 

in air. Two peaks similar to those for germanene at the graphene/Ag(111) interface (Figure 2b) 

were observed, and these peaks were slightly blueshifted. These results provide further evidence 

that the Raman peaks in Figure 2b are derived from germanene. Note that we did not obtain any 

Raman peaks of germanene without the a-B layer in air. 

To  consider  the  aforementioned  blueshift,  we  compared  the  Raman  results  with  the  off-

specular HREEL spectrum of germanene on Ag(111) as shown in Figure 5f. Black (B) and red

(G) dotted lines in Figure 5f show the phonon energies of germanene at the graphene/Ag(111) 

and boron/Ag(111) interfaces, respectively, which were obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The 

positions of the red dotted lines (G) match the peak at ~32.5 meV (262 cm-1) and the shoulder 

peak at ~19.5 meV (157 cm-1) in the HREELS spectrum, indicating that the phonon energies of 

surface  germanene  are  almost  the  same  as  those  of  germanene  at  the  graphene/Ag(111) 

interface rather than boron-coated germanene. This implies that the graphene layer does not 

disturb  the  structure  of  germanene  on  Ag(111).  The  a-B  layer  slightly  interacted  with 

germanene,  resulting  in  the blueshift  in  Figure  5e.  The  limited  interaction  of  graphene  with 

germanene enabled the segregation growth by the simple heating of graphene/Ag(111)/Ge(111) 

samples at atmospheric pressure.

We  analyzed  the  uniformity  of  germanene  at  the  graphene/Ag(111)  interface  by  Raman 

mapping.  Figure  6a  shows  an  optical  microscopy  image  of  the  sample,  and  Figure  6b  and 

Figure 6c show its Raman maps of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the G’ peak 

(graphene) and the peak intensity at 255 cm-1 (germanene), respectively. The germanene peaks 

were observed throughout the graphene-covered region, as schematically shown in Figure 6d, 

indicating that a large area of germanene with high uniformity can be grown by the present 

method.

To verify the possibility of using other types of cap layers, we tested multilayer exfoliated h-

BN (~ 30 nm thickness), exfoliated graphene (monolayer) stacked with h-BN, and sputtered 

Al2O3  (~20  nm  thickness)  for  the  segregation  growth  of  germanene from  Ag(111)/Ge(111). 

Figure 7 shows Raman spectra of the samples with the different cap layers after annealing at 

550 ºC in N2. Raman peaks of germanene were observed in the samples with all the graphene 

and h-BN cap layers, which are vdW materials, while no peaks were observed for the Al2O3 

cap layer. This indicates that germanene were not formed at the interface between Al2O3 and 

Ag(111).  For  the  formation  of  germanene,  it  is  required  for  Ge  atoms  to  segregate  at  the 

interface  and  two-dimensionally  crystallize  as  germanene.  Kurosawa  et  al.  reported  that  Ge 

segregated at the  Al2O3/Ag(111) interface and the segregated Ge formed  Ge-O bonds when 

Al2O3/Ag(111)/Ge(111)  was  heated  in  N2.[28]  This  indicates  that  the  oxide  interface  is  too 

reactive with germanene and thus prevents germanene formation at the interface. In contrast, 

the vdW interfaces, such as graphene and h-BN, are significantly less reactive with germanene, 

providing suitable conditions for growing germanene using the present method. 

In addition, an h-BN cap layer is beneficial for the fabrication of germanene-based devices. 

As Tao et al. reported for the fabrication of silicene FETs,[19] germanene can also be transferred 

onto an insulating substrate. In this case, the h-BN cap layer becomes the top protective layer 

of germanene FETs. Since h-BN is the most suitable substrate for graphene FETs in terms of 

its low carrier scattering by impurities,[29] h-BN-capped germanene has great potential in terms 

of  electronic  properties,  such  as  the  tuning  of  its  bandgap  by  an  E-field  and  a  high  carrier 

mobility comparable to that of graphene.[30]

BN (~ 30 nm thickness), exfoliated graphene (monolayer) stacked with h-BN, CVD graphene 

(monolayer), and sputtered Al2O3 (~20 nm thickness) were deposited on Ag(111)/Ge(111). The 

annealing conditions were 550 ºC under N2 ambient. 

The  stability  of  germanene  at  the  h-BN/Ag(111)  interface  was  also  examined.  Figure  8a 

shows Raman spectra of germanene at the interface after keeping the sample in air for 4, 39, 

and 55 days. The peak shape was preserved after 55 days in air. Figure 8b and Figure 8c show 

the  extracted  peak  positions  and  FWHM  of  the  out-of-plane  and  in-plane  vibration  modes, 

respectively.  There  are  no  significant  changes  in  the  features  of  the  peaks,  indicating  that 

germanene at a vdW interface is stable in air.

3. Conclusion 

We have uniformly grown large-area germanene at a vdW material/Ag(111) interface by the 

segregation  growth  of  germanane.  A  simple  annealing  process  in  N2  or  H2/Ar  at  ambient 

pressure led to the formation of germanene, indicating that a UHV condition is not necessary. 

Owing to the chemical protection by the top vdW material, the grown germanene at the interface 

is stable in air. We found that it is necessary to use a vdW material as a cap layer for the present 

germanene  growth  method  since  the  use  of  an  Al2O3  cap  layer  resulted  in  the  absence  of 

germanene formation. We also proved that Raman spectroscopy in air is a powerful tool for 

characterizing  germanene  at  an  interface.  The  direct  growth  of  h-BN-capped  germanene  is 

considered to be a promising technique for the fabrication of  future germanene-based FETs. 

4. Experimental Section/Methods 

Ag deposition: A Ge(111) surface was chemically cleaned by dipping in diluted HF for 1 ~ 

3 min, then rinsed in deionized water, and dried by blowing N2. Subsequently, a Ag thin film 

of 70 nm thickness was deposited at RT by an e-beam evaporator (RDEC Co., with the Ltd., 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
RDEB-1206K). The deposition rate was 0.4 Å s-1. The deposited Ag film was aligned with the 

(111) crystal direction by solid-phase epitaxy on Ge(111).[7a] 

Transfer of CVD graphene: CVD graphene was grown on a commercial Cu sheet (100 μm 

thickness,  Nilaco)  in  a  laboratory-made  CVD  system  in  the  National  Institute  for  Materials 

Science. The growth of polycrystalline monolayer graphene with high coverage was targeted. 

The typical growth process was as follows: (i) increasing the temperature from RT to 1000 ºC 

in Ar; (ii) H2 annealing at 1000 ºC for 100 min; (iii) graphene growth at 1000 ºC by introducing 

methane with H2 and Ar for 90 min; (iv) cooling to RT in H2/Ar. Details of the growth can be 

found elsewhere.[31] The grown graphene was transferred onto a Ag surface by a standard wet 

transfer  using  spin-coated  poly(methyl  methacrylate)  (PMMA)  as  a  mechanical  support, 

(NH4)2S2O8 as the etchant for Cu, and acetone to remove the PMMA layer.[20b, 32] 

Transfer of exfoliated graphene/h-BN and h-BN: Graphene and h-BN flakes were placed on 

SiO2/Si substrates by mechanical exfoliation using adhesive tapes. A dry transfer onto a Ag 

surface was conducted using laboratory-built transfer equipment and a viscoelastic polymer. 

Details are given elsewhere.[33] 

Al2O3  cap  layer:  An  Al2O3  thin  film  was  directly  deposited  on  a  Ag  surface  by  radio 

frequency  sputtering  (Shibaura  Mechatronics  Corporation,  CFS-4EP-LL)  under  Ar  and  O2 

flows (both at 10 standard cubic centimeters: sccm) at a pressure of 0.3 Pa. The deposition rate 

was 0.14 Å s-1. 

Growth of germanene at the vdW material/Ag(111) interface: Germanane was grown at the 

vdW  material/Ag(111)  interface  by  annealing  using  a  commercial  rapid  annealing  furnace 

(Ulvac, RTA-6) under N2 or H2/Ar flow. The typical annealing sequence used was as follows: 

(i) increasing the temperature from RT to 250 ºC in 2 min; (ii) annealing at 250 ºC for 10 min; 

(iii) increasing the temperature from 250 to 550 ºC in 2 min; (iv) annealing at 550 ºC for 10 

min; (v) natural cooling to RT. The role of the annealing in (ii) is to promote the crystallization 

15 

 
 
 
of Ag(111). Since the segregation of Ge by heating at 250 ºC was negligible (Figure S3), the 

annealing in (ii) was carried out at 250 ºC. 

Characterization: A commercial Raman microscope (Horiba, LabRam HR Evolution) with 

an excitation wavelength of 458 nm in a backscattering geometry was used for obtaining Raman 

spectra  in  air.  Angle-resolved  XPS  (ULVAC-PHI,  Quantera  SXM)  was  used  for  surface 

elemental analyses. Charge correction was performed by shifting all peaks to the position of C 

1s at 285.0 eV. 

In  situ  growth  and  measurement  of  germanene/Ag(111):  We  used  UHV  surface  analysis 

system consisting of two chambers. One chamber was equipped with evaporators of silver and 

boron,  a  sample  heater,  and  AES  and  RHEED  equipment.  The  other  chamber  contained 

HREELS  equipment  and  was  connected  to  the  first  chamber  with  a  load-lock  system.  The 

sample temperature was monitored using an optical pyrometer without calibration. 

Computational calculations: We adopted QUANTUM ESPRESSO 6.5 code,[34] the Perdew–

Burke–Ernzerhof functional[35] for the exchange correlation, and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials 

(Ge.pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF  and  Ag.pbe-n-rrkjus_psl.1.0.0.UPF)  constructed  by  Dal 

Corso.[36] Basic computational parameters for each model, such as the cutoff energies of the 

plane wave and charge (Ecut and Ecut

), the amounts of Brillouin zone sampling for the electrons 

and phonons (k point and q point), and the threshold for residual forces for atoms were set after 

evaluating  the  convergence,  precision,  and  calculation  efficiency.  Tables  1  and  2  show  the 

parameters used for structural optimization and phonon calculations, respectively. 

The surface germanene was modeled with a Ag(111) (7 × 7)-unit four-layer slab supercell 

divided by an approximately 2-nm-thick vacuum layer. Ag atoms in the first layer, which were 

in contact with germanene, were movable, while the other Ag atoms were fixed at bulk positions.

Direct growth method of germanene at interfaces between vdW materials and Ag(111) is 
proposed and developed. The grown germanene is stable in air, which enables its handling in 
air. A vdW interface provides a nanoscale platform for growing germanene similarly to that in 
vacuum, which cannot be achieved with a typical oxide interface such as Al2O3.

Figure  S1a  and  Figure  S1b  are,  respectively,  magnified  and  whole  Raman  spectra  of 

annealed CVD graphene/Ag(111)/Ge(111) in H2/Ar. Germanene peaks (155 and 255 cm-1) were 

observed from 450 to 600 ºC. High temperature annealing resulted in increasing D peak which 

indicates creation of defects in graphene.

S2. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microcopy (STEM) 

To  examine  the  layer  number  of  germanene,  we  performed  cross-sectional  high-angle 

annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM for the annealed graphene/Ag(111)/Ge(111) sample at 550 

ºC.  Figure  S2a  shows  a  cross-sectional  Z-contrast  image  of  the  sample  around  the 

graphene/Ag(111) interface. In Z-contrast images, the contrast is proportional to the square of 

the  atomic  number.  The  rectangel  lattice,  which  composed  of  bright  atoms  in  Figure  S2a, 

corresponds to Ag (111). 

To  detect  germanene,  we  perormed  HAADF-STEM  and  energy  dispersive  X-ray 

spectroscopy (EDS) analysis with the limited scanning area in the green rectangle in Figure S2a. 

The layer number was named as 1 ~ 10 from the interface side to Ag (111) bulk side of the 

sample.  Figure  S2b-d  show  the  Z-contrast  and  the  EDS  singnals  of  Ag  and  Ge.  Figure  S2e 

shows the overlapped EDS signals of Figure S2c and FigureS2d. Figure S2f shows the plots of 

the  normalized  average  signals  of  the  Z-constrast,  the  EDS  Ag,  and  the  EDS  Ge.  Periodic 

signals of Z-contrast and EDS Ag were observed for 3 ~ 10 layers, corresponding to Ag (111) 

crystal planes. The EDS Ge singnals were slightly higher at the 1st layer than the other. This 

indicates that germanene layer is probabely monolayer not multilayer.

S3. Segregation of Ge from Ag(111)/Ge(111) 

Figure  S3  shows  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  surface  atomic  ratio  of  Ge/Ag  of 

Ag(111)/Ge(111) substrate. The Ge/Ag ratios were calculated from the peak area of Ge 3d and 

Ag 3d, which are obtained by XPS, with taking into account the photoionization cross-section 

for each element. Blue and red dots show same data but in different scale of Ge/Ag. Segregation 

of Ge was started from 300 °C. Ge/Ag was increased until 350 °C and remained nearly constant 

at 0.3 until 650 °C (see blue dots). Further heating led the drastic increase of Ge segregation 

and the Ge/Ag ratio reached ~ 12 (see red dots). The drastic increase of Ge/Ag is due to the 

disappearance of the Ag layer by its phase transition to liquid since 700 °C is sufficiently higher 

than the eutectic melting point of Ag-Ge system (~ 650 °C).
