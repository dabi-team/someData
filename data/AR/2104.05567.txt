Electronic excitations near the surface of water ice lead to the desorption of adsorbed molecules,
through a so far debated mechanism. A systematic study of photon-induced indirect desorption,
revealed by the spectral dependence of the desorption (7-13 eV), is conducted for Ar, Kr, N2
and CO adsorbed on H2O or D2O amorphous ices. The mass and isotopic dependence and the
increase of intrinsic desorption eﬃciency with photon energy all point to a mechanism of desorption
induced by collisions between adsorbates and energetic H/D atoms, produced by photodissociation
of water. This constitutes a direct and unambiguous experimental demonstration of the mechanism
of indirect desorption of weakly adsorbed species on water ice, and sheds new light on the possibility
of this mechanism in other systems. It also has implications for the description of photon-induced
desorption in astrochemical models.

Water ice is ubiquitous on Earth and in space, and of-
ten plays the role, among others, of an environment onto
which less abundant molecules adsorb, desorb and react
[1–5]. Energetic irradiation of such environments will
result in energy deposition mostly in the form of elec-
tronic excitations of the water matrix, which can subse-
quently aﬀect molecules adsorbed on the ice through
energy transfer or reaction with radicals. Adsorbate
desorption is one of the possible outcomes. Photodes-
orption by vacuum-UV (VUV) photons is, for instance,
an important process taking place at the surface of inter-
stellar dust grains, which are covered by an icy mantle
mainly composed of water, along with smaller amounts
of molecules such as CO, CO2, N2 or CH4 [6]. It aﬀects
the gas and ice molecular abundances in the interstellar
medium, and explains how some molecules (such as wa-
ter) are observed in the gas at temperatures where their
thermal desorption from grains is not possible [7, 8].

A molecular-scale description of the mechanism by
which an electronic excitation eventually causes desorp-
tion has so far been achieved only for a handful of molec-
ular or atomic solids, such as rare-gas solids [9, 10]. This
is despite a considerable amount of experimental mea-
surements on photodesorption focusing on model ”pure”
molecular ices [11–14], including water ice, as detailed
below. On the other hand, there is currently a lack
of detailed understanding of the desorption properties
- both the desorption mechanism and an estimate of
the yield of the process - of more realistic ”mixed” sys-
tems. In such systems, indirect desorption processes -
where an excited matrix species transfers energy to a
diﬀerent species which desorbs - play an important role.
Indirect photodesorption has been studied for the astro-
physically relevant CO-ice environment [15–19] but the
exact mechanism remains elusive. Water ice is a more
complex but very important system for which indirect
desorption has been little explored.

What has been the object of many studies is the fate

of electronic excitations at the pure water ice surface
[14, 20–25], and how they may lead to desorption of
intact water [26–36]. The dominant underlying mecha-
nism for this latter process remains nonetheless debated.
Theoretical works [26, 27] suggested the co-existence
of two diﬀerent mechanisms, initiated by water pho-
todissociation: one where an energetic H atom issued
from the dissociation transfers momentum to another
molecule and ”kicks” it out into vacuum, and another
where a dissociated water molecule immediately recom-
bines (geminate recombination) with the exothermic en-
ergy of recombination leading to desorption. Experi-
mental measures of the rotational and kinetic energies
of desorbing H2O (v=0) were shown to be compatible
with these mechanisms [28]. However, other experimen-
tal and theoretical investigations [29, 30], in principle
very similar, favoured instead a more direct mechanism,
without dissociation but involving exciton localization
at the surface and an electronic repulsion of the ex-
cited water molecule relative to its surroundings, caus-
ing its desorption, in line with the classic MGR (Menzel-
Gomer-Redhead) model [37].
In addition, we showed
in a recent study [31] that the observed isotopic and
temperature eﬀects in the desorption from water ice re-
quired consideration of additional mechanisms, such as
desorption channels linked with photochemistry. From
the available experimental evidence, it is therefore not
possible to conclude deﬁnitively on the existence of any
of these mechanisms and whether they can be extrapo-
lated to other closely related systems. The desorption
of other molecules adsorbed on water ice, for instance,
remains largely unexplored, despite its importance for
a more realistic description of electronic desorption on
actual icy surfaces.

In this letter we report a study of indirect VUV
photon-induced desorption of molecules weakly ad-
sorbed (Eb < 130 meV) on amorphous water. We sys-
tematically measured indirect photodesorption yields

 
 
 
 
 
 
for four adsorbates (Ar, Kr, CO, N2) on either H2O
or D2O ices. Our results reveal unambiguously that the
energetic H atom collision mechanism dominates indi-
rect desorption for the systems investigated here. It is
therefore now clear that there are systems where this
mechanism does operate and even dominates, although
it is not the case for water desorption from the pure ice
[30, 31].

The experiments were performed in an ultra-high vac-
uum chamber coupled to the DESIRS undulator beam-
line [38] of the SOLEIL synchrotron which provides
monochromatic photons in the VUV range (7-13 eV).
Ices are grown on a polycrystalline copper substrate
cooled down to 15-100 K by exposition to a partial pres-
sure of gas using a dosing tube. First a 100 MLeq (mono-
layer equivalent) water ice is grown at 100 K, yielding
compact amorphous solid water [39] (c-ASW). 1 MLeq
of the adsorbate is then deposited on top at a tempera-
ture of 15 K. The thickness of the deposited molecular
ice is controlled and calibrated using the temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) technique [40]. Pho-
todesorption induced by irradiation of the ice is moni-
tored in the gas phase by quadrupole mass spectrometry
(QMS). We have only monitored desorption of the ad-
sorbates, as intact water, OH or H fragments cannot
be detected under these experimental conditions. The
QMS is calibrated to derive absolute photodesorption
yields, in molecules/incident photon. More experimen-
tal details are described in previous papers [17, 41] and
in the Supplemental Material, which includes ref. [42–
47].

The photodesorption spectrum of Ar

from the
Ar/H2O system is presented on ﬁg. 1. Also shown for
comparison are the photodesorption spectrum of Ar for
a pure 20 ML Ar ice, and the absorption spectrum of
amorphous water ice taken from Lu et al. [48]. Spectral
information provides here a direct evidence of indirect
desorption. The pure Ar photodesorption spectrum is
very diﬀerent from the spectrum of Ar desorbing from
Ar/H2O: the threshold for Ar absorption, and desorp-
tion from the pure ice, is 11.55 eV. Desorption of Ar
below that photon energy in the Ar/H2O spectrum is
therefore due to water ice excitation, as is seen from the
resemblance between that part of the desorption spec-
trum and the absorption spectrum of water ice. We
will focus here in particular on the ﬁrst electronic ex-
cited state of condensed water, which is dissociative in
the gas phase (where it corresponds to the 4a1 ← 1b1
transition) and in condensed phase [24]. An apparent
shift of the maximum of this state, observed at 8.65 eV
in water ice absorption and at 8.95 eV in the Ar from
Ar/H2O desorption spectrum, can be observed.

This apparent shift actually corresponds to a defor-
mation of the spectrum caused by an increase of des-
orption eﬃciency throughout the ﬁrst electronic state
of H2O ice. This is visible in the lower panel of ﬁg.

by the H2O absorption spectrum, yielding the intrin-
sic desorption eﬃciency. The eﬃciency increases almost
linearly from 8 to 9 eV, then remains constant at higher
photon energy.

Similar experiments performed on 1 MLeq Kr, N2 and
CO adsorbed on compact amorphous H2O are displayed
in ﬁg.
2. The absolute photodesorption yields dif-
fer but the spectral shape for Kr and N2, whose ﬁrst
dipole-allowed electronic state are respectively at 9.9
eV and 12.4 eV in the condensed phase, is similar to
Ar/H2O. For both these adsorbates, as for Ar,
it is
therefore straightforward to measure indirect desorp-
tion through the spectral signature of the ﬁrst water
ice excited state around 9 eV. This state appears again
blue-shifted compared to the absorption spectrum in the
desorption spectra. The excitation threshold of CO on
the other hand is at 7.9 eV, and its ﬁrst excited state
overlaps with the water ice excited state. Still, the struc-
ture due to the vibronic bands of that CO excited state
makes it so that one can still easily see the presence,
and estimate the quantitative contribution, of indirect

of indirect desorption.

Indirect desorption on water ice has been demon-
strated before in the case of adsorbed benzene, using
electron-stimulated desorption [23, 49]. In that case the
authors concluded that an electronic excitation trans-
fer occurred between water and benzene. In our case,
we can exclude any mechanism of that kind, i.e. that
would involve energy transfer to the internal modes of
the adsorbates. We observe indirect desorption occur-
ring in the case of Ar and Kr below their excitation
threshold: an electronic energy transfer is energetically
impossible for these two adsorbates, and there is no no-
tion of transfer to other modes (vibrational, librational)
for these atoms as there could be for molecules. Let us
now turn to the mechanisms that have been proposed for
intact water desorption from the pure ice. Interestingly,
these mechanisms predict diﬀerent isotopic eﬀects. The
mechanisms of excited state repulsion and geminate re-
combination mentioned earlier predict no or close to no
isotopic eﬀect, while the H/D atom collision mechanism
implies a higher eﬃciency of desorption for D2O than
for H2O, because D atoms transfer momentum to heav-
ier species more eﬃciently than H atoms. In the most
recent experiments on pure water ice [31], we observed
for intact water desorption a higher desorption yield for
H2O than for D2O, in contradiction with several of these
mechanisms. However the reverse isotopic eﬀect is ob-
served here: indirect desorption is more eﬃcient on D2O
ices, implying a diﬀerent dominant mechanism than for
intact water desorption. The most ﬁtting mechanism
for indirect desorption is therefore energetic H/D atom
collision, also called kick-out mechanism.

In the present case, where our adsorbates are atoms or
diatomic molecules, this mechanism can be modelled as
a pure kinetic energy transfer in a simple hard sphere
collision. The fraction of transferred energy therefore
simply depends on the masses of the colliding atom (H
or D) and the adsorbate. It can be written as:

water-induced desorption to the overall CO desorption
spectrum.

The experiments were repeated for the same adsor-
bates on D2O ice (grown under the same conditions)
for comparison. The results are shown in ﬁg. S2 and
are quite similar to those obtained for H2O (including
the increase of desorption eﬃciency throughout the ﬁrst
water ice electronic state), to the exception of the abso-
lute photodesorption yield which is diﬀerent.

The experimental results are summarized in table I,
indicating the indirect desorption yields (as measured
at the maximum of the ﬁrst electronic state of water
in the desorption spectrum, around 9 eV) for all inves-
tigated systems as well as the binding energy of each
adsorbate to water ice and their mass. First we can ob-
serve that the indirect desorption yield goes in the order
CO > N2 > Ar > Kr, and second that for a given ad-
sorbate, the indirect desorption yield is systematically
higher on D2O ice than on H2O ice. These facts, along
with the observed linear increase of desorption eﬃciency
through the ﬁrst water ice electronic state in the desorp-
tion spectra, allow us to discuss the possible mechanisms

the adsorbate upon collision, Ekin,H/D the initial ki-
netic energy of the H/D atom, and mH/D and mads the
respective masses of the H/D atom and the adsorbate.
Let us now estimate the kinetic energy of the H/D atom
upon water dissociation. At a photon energy of 9 eV,
considering a dissociation energy of 5.4 eV for H2O and
∼ 0.7 eV going into OH translational and internal en-
ergy [51], the H atom ends up with approximately 2.9
eV of kinetic energy. A D atom would have slightly less.
We can calculate that the absolute amount of kinetic
energy transferred to the adsorbate therefore varies be-
tween 100 and 600 meV for our systems.

Fig. 3 shows the indirect desorption yields of all inves-
tigated systems plotted against the estimated amount of
kinetic energy that would be transferred to the adsor-
bate in a collision with an H/D atom (Ekin,transf ). This
ﬁgure shows a clear positive correlation. To conﬁrm fur-
ther the hypothesis of the collision mechanism, we need
to know how the desorption probability of the adsorbate
relates to the amount of transferred kinetic energy. This
has been explored by Fredon et al. [52, 53] in molecular
dynamics simulations. In these works the authors look
at the desorption and energy dissipation of molecules at
the surface of water ice which have been given transla-
tional energy. They derive an empirical function for the
desorption probability as a function of initially imparted
translational energy:

Pdes(Ekin) = 1 − exp

with Pdes the desorption probability, Ekin the kinetic
energy imparted initially to the adsorbate, Ebind the
binding energy of the adsorbate, and ω a factor set to
0.3 which ﬁts best their simulation results.

The desorption probability calculated from equation
2, is plotted on ﬁg. 3 for Ebind = 70, 100 and 130 meV
and ω = 0.3. A good agreement with the experimental
results is obtained, especially considering the error bars,
relative calibration uncertainties and the fact that each
species have slightly diﬀerent binding energies. Some
of the observed diﬀerences - e.g. the fact that the rare
gases points tend to be closer to the lower curve and
the diatomic points to the upper one, contrary to what
would be expected from their binding energy diﬀerences
- could indicate diﬀerences in the behaviour of atoms
and molecules, as discussed below. The various sources
of uncertainty however preclude ﬁrm conclusions.

The H/D collision mechanism also explains the lin-
ear increase of desorption eﬃciency observed between 8
and 9 eV (bottom panel of ﬁg. 1). As photon energy
increases throughout the ﬁrst state, the amount of ex-
cess energy available increases as well and therefore the
kinetic energy of the H/D atoms increases. This can (i)
increase the amount of kinetic energy imparted by H/D

Indirect desorption yields for each system as a
function of the fraction of kinetic energy transferred in the
collision of an H/D atom with the adsorbate (see text for
the formula). The indirect desorption yield is measured as
the photodesorption yield at 9 eV at the maximum of the
ﬁrst electronic state of water ice. Error bars only reﬂect
the signal to noise ratio of the desorption spectra, not errors
in the relative calibration of the signals and coverage of the
diﬀerent species (see Supplemental Material). The green line
is the desorption probability model from Fredon et al.

atoms to the adsorbates, and (ii) increase the contribu-
tion of deeper layers of the ice to indirect desorption,
as H/D atoms originating from deeper layers acquire
suﬃcient kinetic energy to reach the surface and kick
adsorbates. Both eﬀects will lead to an increased des-
orption probability with photon energy. The changes in
the desorption probabilities depend in principle on the
diﬀerent parameters in equation 2 and should therefore
vary for the diﬀerent adsorbates, leading to diﬀerent
spectrum deformations. The desorption eﬃciencies are
shown in the Supplemental Material. While the changes
are indeed not exactly similar, they remain too small to
analyse further.

Above 9 eV the increase in desorption eﬃciency is
no longer observed, which can be explained by the loss
of energy to other channels such as vibrational or elec-
tronic excitation of the fragments [26]. Higher electronic
states of water ice can be excited that also have a disso-
ciative character [54], and therefore they can also lead
to production of energetic H atoms and collision desorp-
tion.

One possibility that needs to be discussed before con-
cluding deﬁnitively in favor of the H/D collision, is a
mechanism that would involve collisions with OH/OD
fragments. The more favourable mass ratio with the ad-
sorbates means that even though OH/OD fragments ac-
quire much less kinetic energy than H/D fragments upon
dissociation, they would still transfer enough kinetic en-

The isotopic eﬀect observed
would then come not from the collision with the adsor-
bate, but from the photodissociation event, where OD
fragments acquire almost twice more energy than OH
fragment due to momentum conservation. Such a mech-
anism has however not been observed in the molecular
dynamics simulations that observed the H/D collision
mechanism. Furthermore, OH/OD fragments have a
much lower mobility in ice [35], and from momentum
conservation estimations [51] would transfer twice less
energy to adsorbates than in the equivalent H/D colli-
sion. We therefore consider this mechanism as possible
but non-dominant.

The full elucidation of the indirect desorption mech-
anism means that our results can be extrapolated to
other systems. All weakly adsorbed atoms and diatomic
molecules, at least, should follow a behaviour similar to
what we observed. For these species the photodesorp-
tion yields can be derived from the desorption model
of equations 1 and 2, scaled to the experimentally mea-
sured absolute values. As pointed out above, there could
be slight diﬀerences in the behaviour of atoms and di-
atomic molecules considering that for the latter exci-
tation of internal degrees of freedom are possible. We
would for sure expect deviations for even more sizeable
molecules, for which a hard sphere collision model will
not be appropriate any more, and for cases where a reac-
tive collision can compete. Already for the case of H2O
desorption itself by the H collision mechanism, the the-
oretical calculations [26] point to the importance of the
collision happening at the center of mass of the molecule
(on the O atom) for the eﬃciency of the process. For ad-
sorbates that form hydrogen bonds with water we may
expect also diﬀerent processes coming into play, such as
electronic energy transfer as in the case of benzene on
water ice [49]. Nonetheless, the present results could
serve as a ﬁrst basis for the modelling of indirect water-
induced desorption in e.g. astrochemical models.

As we outlined previously, the so-called ”kick-out”
mechanism, which was among the ﬁrst mechanisms sug-
gested to explain desorption from pure water ice [26],
had not received a completely unambiguous experimen-
tal demonstration of its existence so far, due to the com-
plexity of disentangling the diﬀerent possible mecha-
nisms from the available data for pure water ice [30, 31].
We now provide such a demonstration in a slightly dif-
ferent system, weakly adsorbed molecules on water ice,
for which all experimental facts converge. We thus shed
light on a way indirect desorption can proceed. This
is an important step towards a better comprehension
of (indirect) desorption processes induced by electronic
transitions and the fate of excitations at the water ice
surface. This mechanism also deserves interest for any
surface from which energetic H atoms could be produced
(other hydride molecular ices, hydrogenated carbon sur-
faces...).
