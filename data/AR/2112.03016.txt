Persistence for a class of order-one
autoregressive processes and
Mallows-Riordan polynomials

Gerold Alsmeyer, Alin Bostan, Kilian Raschel and Thomas Simon

Abstract We establish exact formulae for the persistence probabilities of
an AR(1) sequence with symmetric uniform innovations in terms of certain
families of polynomials, most notably a family introduced by Mallows and
Riordan as enumerators of ﬁnite labeled trees when ordered by inversions. The
connection of these polynomials with the volumes of certain polytopes is also
discussed. Two further results provide factorizations of general AR(1) models,
one for negative drifts with continuous innovations, and one for positive drifts
with continuous and symmetric innovations. The second factorization extends
a classical universal formula of Sparre Andersen for symmetric random walks.
Our results also lead to explicit asymptotic estimates for the persistence
probabilities.

1 Introduction and main results

Let X be a real Gaussian random variable with mean µ and variance σ2.
Then Y = eX has a log-normal distribution with integer moments E[Y n] =

where θ = eσ2
and z = teµ+σ2/2. However, being divergent except for the
degenerate case σ2 = 0, the above series are considered as formal power
series only, and the notation
is used here and throughout to express identity
between two such series.

It was observed by Mallows and Riordan in [23] that the right-hand side
of (1) is the exponential generating function of a family of polynomials with
integer coeﬃcients. More precisely, Eq. (2) in [23] asserts that

The main result of [23] is that, for each n > 1, Jn(θ) equals the enumerator
of trees with n labeled points by number of inversions, when inversions are
counted on each branch and ordered away from the root, which receives label

by Cauchy’s product, integration and identifying coeﬃcients, see Formula (5)
in [23]. Mallows-Riordan polynomials, sometimes also called inversion polyno-
mials in the literature, appear in many other counting problems, see [11] and
the references therein. For example, it was shown in [14] that θn−1Jn(θ + 1)
is the enumerator of connected labeled n-vertex graphs by number of edges,
thus Jn(2) is the total number of these graphs. Mallows-Riordan polynomi-
als are also an instance of Tutte’s bivariate dichromatic polynomials in [33]
with one variable ﬁxed, a topic we will discuss in some more detail in Para-
graph 5.1. Let us ﬁnally mention that several conjectures on further combina-
torial aspects of Mallows-Riordan polynomials are stated by Sokal in [27, 28].

The main purpose of this paper is to provide a probabilistic interpretation
of Mallows-Riordan polynomials that is not only quite diﬀerent from the
above connection with the log-normal distribution, but in fact also rather
unexpected. To be more speciﬁc, consider a real autoregressive sequence of
order one, deﬁned by

The present work aims at providing some exact formulae for certain such
order 1 autoregressive persistence probabilities, which then also lead to more
explicit asymptotics. Our ﬁrst main result establishes the announced unex-
pected relationship with Mallows-Riordan polynomials and considers the case
when the innovation law is uniform on [
1, 1]. For this case, we stipulate that

this quantity and pU

2 ) may appear even more surprising.
We present three proofs of Theorem 1, all to be found in Subsection 2.1.
The ﬁrst one relies on a linear recurrence relation between the pn(θ) that
leads to a closed-form expression of their generating function as a ratio, see
Proposition 1, which in turn is of the same kind as a combinatorial formula
for Mallows-Riordan polynomials stated in [12, Eq. (14.6)]. The other two
proofs are variations, the ﬁrst one via multivariate changes of variable and
1)nJn+1(θ)/n! can be viewed as the algebraic
the second one by using that (θ
volume of a certain polytope, see Proposition 2. This volume interpretation
is further discussed in Paragraph 5.1 in the framework of Tutte polytopes.
Thanks to the exact character of Theorem 1, we are able in Subsection 2.2 to
derive some precise asymptotics for pU
n (θ) and even a complete asymptotic

outside this interval the situation changes because the domain of integration
of the integral deﬁning pU
n (θ) undergoes truncations that make it behave
diﬀerently as a function of θ. Therefore, we will show by two further theorems,
assuming θ < 0 and θ > 0, respectively, that a relation between the family

then be utilized to derive identites for pn(θ) in terms of two new families of
polynomials with integer coeﬃcients, denoted
Jn(θ), respectively,
and still related to the Mallows-Riordan polynomials Jn(θ) through identities
in terms of their generating functions, see Corollaries 1 and 2.

The proof of this result, to be found in Subsection 3.1, relies on a linear
recurrence similar to the one derived in our ﬁrst proof of Theorem 1. It further
hinges on the fact that the pn(θ) can be expressed in terms of the ﬁnite dual
perpetuities
1/θ. This is where the involution
comes into play and our argument only requires the absence of non-negative
atoms, a condition which also seems to be necessary by Remark 3.1 below.

n (θ)
for n > k + 1 as a function of 1/θ. Namely, if θ > 2, then these coeﬃcients
are independent of n as asserted by Proposition 4.3. This in turn will lead
to an explicit formula, see (47) in Subsection 4.3, for the all-time persistence

more general case of continuous, symmetric innovations and for any θ > 1,
we show in Proposition 4.5 that the all-time persistence probability is also
positive in the positive recurrent case.

be seen as a variation of the one in the preceding subsection, because it has
been ﬁnalized by a use of Proposition 2. Let us also note that, when deﬁning

passing that one can easily check the assertion of Theorem 2 for the persis-
tence probabilities in this case. We will return to biexponential innovations
in the more complicated case θ > 0 in Remark 4.1(a).

3.3 Proof of Corollary 1 and properties of the

The proof of Corollary 1 essentially amounts to a derivation of the stated
Jn(θ) deﬁned by (11), which is done by Proposition 3.6
properties of the
below. We also collect a number of further relevant aspects of the
Jn(θ) in
this subsection, though without claiming to be exhaustive. Eq. (10), where
these polynomials appear, can easily be deduced from Theorems 1 and 2 via
an induction, and we omit giving details.

C1(0) = 1. Moreover, it has leading coeﬃcient 1 as one can deduce from

the polynomials Cn exhibit some similarities with Touchard’s polynomials,
see [32, p. 24], but their full combinatorics have apparently not yet been dis-
cussed in the literature.

Remark 4.1 (a) In the case when X1 has a biexponential law and θ
(0, 1),
the generating function of the persistence probabilities can be computed from
the results of [22] in terms of q-series. More precisely, it follows from Formula
(31) in [22] that

These formulae for pn(θ) if θ > 0 are signiﬁcantly more complicated than for
θ < 0, see Remark 3.5. On the other hand, they exhibit some interesting sim-
ilarities with those in the case of uniform innovations, due to the q-binomial
theorem. Skipping details, formula (40) can indeed be rewritten

4.3 Asymptotic behaviour

The next result is a further consequence of Theorem 3 and provides an un-
expected extension of a well-known result for dual pairs of ladder epochs of
ordinary random walks (which occurs here if θ = 1) to general AR(1) pro-
cesses with drift θ > 1 and symmetric, continuous innovation law. To see the
connection with ladder epochs, we point out the obvious facts that

|

If θ = 1, then (Yn)n>0 is an ordinary random walk with continuous and
symmetric increment law. Denoting by T ∗
its ﬁrst weakly
descending ladder epoch, it follows from the famous Spitzer-Baxter identities,
see e.g. [8, Sect. 8.4], that (T1, T ∗

1 ) form a dual pair satisfying

(46)

But under the given additional assumptions on the increment law, it follows
immediately that T1 and T ∗
1 are identically distributed, so that (45) can
indeed be viewed as an extension of (46) of the aforementioned kind. Finally,
we should note that all quantities in (46) are 0 because the random walk is
symmetric and thus particularly oscillating.

Proof (of Proposition 4.5). We already pointed out in the Introduction that
an AR(1) process (Yn)n>0 deﬁned by (5) is positive recurrent if and only if

The following corollary follows directly from Proposition 2 and (51) above.

Corollary 5.1 For all n > 1 and t > 0, one has

vol Tn(0, t) = tn TKn+1(1, 1 + t)/n!.

The result particularly provides that the volume of the Cayley polytope

Cn = vol Tn(0, 1) =

with n + 1 vertices. This fact was conjectured in [5] and proved in [18], as a
consequence of the more general formula

for any n > 1, q
(0, 1] and t > 0, see Theorem 1.3 therein. The limiting
case q = 0 follows directly from Proposition 2, the proof of which is more
elementary than the arguments developed in [18]. See also Theorem 3 in [19]
for another elementary proof of Corollary 5.1 in the case t = 1 using partitions
of integers. The natural question arises whether the general identity (52)
admits a simple proof as well.

Before we ﬁnish this subsection by pointing out a curious connection be-
tween the Tutte polynomial Tn(x, θ) and a certain Poisson process on N for

5.2 Inﬁnite divisibility

This subsection is devoted to aspects of inﬁnite divisibility (ID) in connection
with the persistence probabilities pn(θ), and it begins with a discussion of
1, related to the pn(θ) by
the shifted ﬁrst passage time below zero

P[

Tθ = n] = pn(θ)

−

Tθ = Tθ −
pn+1(θ)
e

for all n > 0.

Unlike Tθ, it qualiﬁes at all to have a discrete ID law by taking values in N0
e
rather than N only.

For a downward skip-free Markov chain on Z, it is easy to see by right
continuity that its shifted passage time below zero is indeed always ID, but
already replacing the state space with the whole real line makes the problem
less immediate because of the jumps. Back to the model (5) studied in this
work and assuming θ = 0 (white-noise case), the random variable
T0 is geo-
metric and hence ID regardless of the innovation law, see e.g. Example II.2.6
in [31]. If θ = 1 (random walk case) and the innovation law is symmetric and
continuous, then the Sparre Andersen formula (13) provides

and since νθ is a positive measure on (0, 1), we arrive at the desired conclusion
(cid:3)
as in the case θ = 1.

Remark 5.5 (a) The moment sequence representation argument to show
log-convexity does no longer work if θ =

coeﬃcients. But even the assertion that the polynomial

of cos(πx/2b)~1[0,b](x). In all other cases, the eigenvectors are the solutions to
certain delayed ODE’s and of unknown explicit form. Finally, it would also
be interesting to know if the largest eigenvalue of this truncated Volterra
operator is computable in the case θ = (a/(a + b), 1).
