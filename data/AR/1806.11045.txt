ABSTRACT

Context. Magnetic energy is required to heat the corona, the outer atmosphere of the Sun, to millions of degrees.
Aims. We study the nature of the magnetic energy source that is probably responsible for the brightening of coronal loops driven by
nanoﬂares in the cores of solar active regions.
Methods. We consider observations of two active regions (ARs), 11890 and 12234, in which nanoﬂares have been detected. To this
end, we use ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for coronal loop diagnostics. These images are combined with the co-temporal line-of-sight magnetic
ﬁeld maps from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO to investigate the connection between coronal loops and
their magnetic roots in the photosphere.
Results. The core of these ARs exhibit loop brightening in multiple EUV channels of AIA, particularly in its 9.4 nm ﬁlter. The
HMI magnetic ﬁeld maps reveal the presence of a complex mixed polarity magnetic ﬁeld distribution at the base of these loops.
We detect the cancellation of photospheric magnetic ﬂux at these locations at a rate of about 1015 Mx s−1. The associated compact
coronal brightenings directly above the cancelling magnetic features are indicative of plasma heating due to chromospheric magnetic
reconnection.
Conclusions. We suggest that the complex magnetic topology and the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld, such as ﬂux cancellation in the
photosphere and the resulting chromospheric reconnection, can play an important role in energizing active region coronal loops
driven by nanoﬂares. Our estimate of magnetic energy release during ﬂux cancellation in the quiet Sun suggests that chromospheric
reconnection can also power the quiet corona.

Key words. Sun: atmosphere – Sun: chromosphere – Sun: corona – Sun: magnetic ﬁelds — Sun: photosphere

1. Introduction

The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and the thermal X-ray emission
from the corona of the Sun is radiated by plasma at temperatures
in excess of 1 MK, which is much hotter than the Sun’s surface
temperature of about 6,000 K. Spatially resolved solar observa-
tions reveal that, at EUV and X-ray wavelengths, the corona is
particularly bright in active regions (ARs) hosting strong mag-
netic ﬁeld concentrations including sunspots. The cores of these
ARs have an emission component from hot plasma at tempera-
tures of about 5 MK (Testa & Reale 2012) conﬁned by the mag-
netic ﬁeld structured in the form of compact loops. The origin of
such high-temperature plasma and, more generally, the nature of
the energy source responsible for coronal heating remain poorly
understood. Any heating process has to explain not only the
high temperature, but also the observed spatial structuring and
temporal intermittency in the corona (e.g. Webb & Zirin 1981;
Shimizu et al. 1992; Falconer et al. 1997; Ugarte-Urra & Warren
2014).

During the emergence of an AR, when new sunspots form,
the energy released from the rapid reconﬁguration of surface
magnetic ﬁelds, including emergence and cancellation of mag-
netic ﬂux, can heat the plasma to several million Kelvin (e.g.
Engell et al. 2011). However, the active corona persists for sev-
eral days or even weeks, well after the emergence of large-

scale magnetic ﬁeld has ceased (e.g. Ugarte-Urra & Warren
2014). Therefore, current scenarios of coronal heating rely on
either the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves
(e.g. Hollweg 1981; Asgari-Targhi et al. 2015; Karampelas et al.
2017), or Ohmic dissipation of current sheets in nanoﬂares, in-
duced by slowly moving the footpoints of coronal loops and
braiding the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Parker 1988; Priest et al. 2002;
Klimchuk 2006). MHD waves are observed to be ubiquitous in
the solar atmosphere (Tomczyk et al. 2007) and they can heat
the quiet corona, i.e. the corona outside ARs (McIntosh et al.
2011), but in general the observed wave power is two-orders-of-
magnitude too weak to power the AR corona (Withbroe & Noyes
1977). Although coronal loops may develop ubiquitous mag-
netic braids due to continual motion of their footpoints at the
surface, direct observations of magnetic braiding, which would
indicate the release of energy through unwinding of those braids,
are sparse (Cirtain et al. 2013). Moreover, questions were raised
on the kind of footpoint motions that would generate such highly
braided structures (van Ballegooijen et al. 2014). Furthermore,
Tiwari et al. (2014) observed that the coronal brightenings at
these braids were not triggered internally, but were initiated ex-
ternally by photospheric ﬂux cancellation along a polarity inver-
sion line over which the braided structure had formed.

Recent studies that connect the evolution of coronal bright-
enings to the evolution of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in ARs

ﬁnd that some of the bright coronal loops are rooted in regions
of mixed magnetic polarities (i.e. regions where a dominant
magnetic polarity and minor opposite magnetic polarity patches
are present; Chitta et al. 2017a; Tiwari et al. 2017; Huang et al.
2018). Interactions of such mixed-polarity magnetic ﬁelds lead-
ing to the cancellation of surface magnetic ﬂux followed by
disturbances in the solar atmosphere that are widely associ-
ated with magnetic reconnection (e.g. plasma jets and compact
brightenings) are also observed at the footpoints of coronal loops
(Chitta et al. 2017a,b; Huang et al. 2018).

Based on the above observations, we ﬁnd it necessary to in-
vestigate the nature of the magnetic energy source that is likely
responsible for powering the coronal loops, in particular loops
in the cores of ARs hosting hot plasma at several million Kelvin.
In the present work, we consider brightenings in such loops that
are associated with nanoﬂares. We ﬁnd that these loops are ap-
parently rooted in photospheric regions with a complex magnetic
landscape containing mixed magnetic polarities. We notice that
intermittent brightenings in the solar atmosphere follow surface
magnetic ﬂux cancellation at these locations. Our ﬁndings hint
at the possibility of reconnection driven by the cancellation of
surface magnetic ﬂux as the energy source, at least in some of
the coronal loop brightenings.

2. Observations

To investigate the origin of coronal loop brightenings in AR
cores, we consider observations of AR 11890 and AR 12234 ob-
tained with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012). We use time series of images recorded in the ultravi-
olet (UV) at a cadence of 24 s and the EUV at a cadence of
12 s by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) onboard SDO to detect brightenings through the solar at-
mosphere. To trace the magnetic roots of these coronal loops
at the solar surface, we analyse co-temporal, photospheric line-
of-sight magnetic ﬁeld maps of these ARs, recorded every 45 s
by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.
2012) onboard SDO.

As described at the end of Sect. 1, these ARs are chosen sim-
ply because the loop brightenings in their cores are attributed to
nanoﬂares. For instance, Testa et al. (2014) presented imaging
and spectroscopic observations of AR 11890, where they detect
footpoint brightenings at the base of a coronal loop that is visible
in the AIA 9.4 nm ﬁlter. These footpoint brightenings are asso-
ciated with modest upﬂows with velocities of 15 km s−1 in the
transition-region Si iv observations obtained from the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph. Based on numerical modelling of
impulsively heated loops, the authors argued that the footpoint
brightening and the upﬂows in the transition region are due to
the interaction of the lower atmosphere with non-thermal elec-
trons accelerated in coronal nanoﬂares. Similarly, Ishikawa et al.
(2017) presented observations from the Focusing Optics X-ray
Solar Imager, with a detection of faint emission in hard X-rays
(above 3 keV) in AR 12234 that they ascribed to plasma heated
above 10 MK in nanoﬂares.

3. Brightening in AR 11890

Here we describe the case of a coronal loop brightening in AR
11890 observed on 9 November 2013 (Fig. 1); Testa et al. (2014)
presented observations covering western footpoints of this loop
(including the region roughly covered by the magenta box in
Fig. 1) during the same period. This loop brightening is clearly

distinguishable in the 9.4 nm ﬁlter of AIA for about 40 minutes.
This ﬁlter can detect plasma at temperatures of about 7 MK, but
is also sensitive to cooler plasma at temperatures of about 1 MK.
During the phase when the main section of the loop is bright
in the 9.4 nm ﬁlter (Fig. 1(a)), it was invisible (or indistinguish-
able) to the other ﬁlters of AIA at 17.1 nm, 19.3 nm, or 21.1 nm,
that are more sensitive to plasma at ∼1 MK (Boerner et al. 2012),
which suggests that most of the brightening in the 9.4 nm image
is due to hot plasma. This is demonstrated using the 17.1 nm ﬁl-
ter image displayed in Fig. 1(c).

The loop brightening presented some interesting characteris-
tics. Once the hot core loop is fully developed (Fig. 1(a)), it con-
nects the main positive (white/west) and negative (black/east)
magnetic polarities at both ends. The AIA 9.4 nm emission light
curves of hot plasma near these regions show a similar evo-
lution and both feet brighten almost simultaneously. This ap-
plies in particular to the initial, smaller brightenings visible in
the light curves (see short vertical lines in panel (b)), which are
clearly seen as transient bright dots in the accompanying online
movie (distinguishable at the western footpoint from 11:50 UT
onward). The bulk of the loop shows similar evolution to the
footpoints. The light curve from the AIA 17.1 nm ﬁlter show-
ing the evolution of cooler plasma (panel (d)) also displays high
variability, but only near the eastern footpoint. Similar, high vari-
ability in the emission, although only at the eastern footpoint,
is also apparent in the AIA 19.3 nm and 21.1 nm ﬁlter images.
These intensity ﬂuctuations near the eastern footpoint originate
from a bright compact feature in the corona (see panel (c) and
the movie).

When these coronal emission maps are examined in conjunc-
tion with the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld maps, we ﬁnd that the
bright compact coronal feature near the eastern footpoint lies
directly above the region where the surface magnetic ﬁeld is
mixed with the presence of opposite magnetic polarities (see ar-
row in panel (e); magnetic ﬁeld contours in panels (a) and (c)).
Moreover, the surface magnetic ﬁeld in the region of interest
(black box in panel (e)) is evolving, in that we observe a mono-
tonic decrease of the magnetic ﬂux in the area at a rate of about
1015 Mx s−1 (panel (f)). We note that this decrease is due to the
local disappearance of the magnetic ﬂux and is not due to the
advection of the ﬂux out of the rectangular box considered.

To examine the evolution of the lower atmosphere during the
loop brightening, we adopt the ratio of AIA UV ﬁlters at 160 nm
and 170 nm. The 160 nm ﬁlter samples photospheric continuum
and also has a contribution from the C iv doublet forming at
a characteristic transition region temperature of ∼0.1 MK. The
170 nm ﬁlter records photospheric continuum only (Lemen et al.
2012). The intensity ratio of 160 nm and 170 nm ﬁlters can pro-
vide information on the C iv emission, if present, by normaliz-
ing out continuum from both the ﬁlters. Therefore, we expect
that the ratio of these light curves will be (i) close to constant if
the C iv doublet contribution to the 160 nm ﬁlter is steady, and
(ii) smaller compared to regions with higher densities of C iv
(meaning less plasma at 0.1 MK assuming equilibrium condi-
tions). In Fig. 2 we plot such ratios from the eastern and western
loop footpoints (black and magenta), and from a quiet-Sun re-
gion for reference (green). Unlike the almost time-independent
(steady) and smaller (less plasma at 0.1 MK) ﬁlter ratio from the
quiet-Sun region, the ratios from the footpoint regions are akin to
their coronal counterparts (particularly the 17.1 nm light curves).
The ratio from the eastern footpoint is similar to the intensity
ﬂuctuations observed in prolonged UV bursts, which are thought
to result from magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere (e.g.
Chitta et al. 2017b).

footpoint as a function of time (see arrow). The vertical dashed line in the right panels marks the time-stamp of the corresponding spatial maps

Based on the presence of mixed polarities and the decrease in
the magnetic ﬂux at the surface, which coincides with the over-
lying brightenings near the eastern footpoint, we infer that this
cancellation of magnetic ﬂux is associated with magnetic recon-
nection. Here the magnetic energy released during the reconnec-
tion is likely responsible for the compact brightening, and the
decrease in the surface magnetic ﬂux is a consequence of the
submergence of the reconnected ﬁeld. We note that these mixed
polarity magnetic concentrations are present only near the east-
ern footpoint but not at the western one (Fig. 1(e)). We cannot,
however, rule out the presence of smaller and weaker patches of
opposite polarity magnetic elements at the western footpoint due
to the moderate spatial resolution of the HMI (e.g. Chitta et al.
2017a, cf. Barthol et al. 2011; Solanki et al. 2017).

The similarities in the AIA 9.4 nm light curves from both the
footpoints suggest that they are causally connected. Moreover,

the compact bright region near the eastern footpoint is directly
overlying a source, where the magnetic energy is likely released
during the reconnection process. This indicates that the magnetic
reconnection at the eastern footpoint is probably also responsible
for the disturbances seen at the western footpoint.

4. Brightening in AR 12234

On 11 December 2014, during its second suborbital rocket ﬂight,
the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2) detected
a nanoﬂare in AR 12234, with faint emission in hard X-rays
(above 3 keV), from plasma heated to temperatures above 10 MK
(Ishikawa et al. 2017). The AR exhibited coronal brightenings
recorded by AIA that are co-temporal to the inferred nanoﬂare
in the same region. Unlike the AR-scale brightening displayed in
Fig. 1, the AR 12234 brightening is a small-scale event extend-

2017b; Tian et al. 2018). The location of the reconnection site
can also be understood in terms of the horizontal separation at
the solar surface between opposite-polarity magnetic concentra-
tions while cancelling. Therefore, if the chromospheric recon-
nection is also responsible for the observed loop brightenings,
then, clearly, the exact energy input into the loops depends on
the location of the reconnection, meaning that we can only pro-
vide an order-of-magnitude estimation.

We use the loop brightening presented in Fig. 1 as an ex-
ample to estimate the energy content in the coronal section of
the loop. The thermal energy density for a parcel of a mono-
atomic gas at temperature, T , and particle density, n, is given by
ether = 3
2 nkBT , where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Here, we
consider a typical coronal electron number density of 109 cm−3,
and a plasma temperature of 7 MK, such that the loop is clearly
visible in the AIA 9.4 nm ﬁlter. The thermal energy of the loop
is then etherV, where V is the volume of the loop. From Fig. 1(a),
the loop is roughly 10 Mm wide and 100 Mm long.2 With these
values, and the additional assumption that it has a circular cross-
section, we estimate the thermal energy content of the loop to be
8 × 1027 erg. Next, we estimate the upper limit for the kinetic en-
ergy to be of the same order of magnitude as the thermal energy,
because one can safely assume that the ﬂows within the loop are
subsonic (i.e. below about 400 km s−1). The energy required for
the ionization of gas is negligible in comparison. Consequently,
the total energy content of the loop is approximately 1028 erg.

Motivated by the close association of the ﬂux cancellation
with the loop brightening, we propose that the energy required
for this loop brightening can be extracted from chromospheric
reconnection at heights of around 500 km. Staying with the ex-
ample from Fig. 1, we ﬁnd that the cancelled ﬂux amounts to
about Φ = 2.25 × 1019 Mx. To estimate the converted energy
in the ﬂux cancellation, we use the (cancelled) magnetic en-
ergy Emag = 1
8π B2V in the volume V = A H where the en-
ergy is released. We estimated the height range of energy re-
lease to be H = 500 km above,3 and we estimate the area to be
A = 3 Mm × 3 Mm through the extent of the brightening near
the eastern footpoint in Fig. 1(c). The cancelled ﬂux Φ = BA
corresponds to the (cancelled) magnetic ﬁeld B integrated over
the area A, meaning that we ﬁnd the estimation for the mag-
netic energy converted during the ﬂux cancellation to be given
through Emag = 1
8π Φ2H/A. With the above values, we ﬁnd
Emag = 1028 erg, which is comparable to the estimate for the
energy content of the heated loop. We note that this estimate
for Emag might be a lower limit, because the reconnection re-
gion is most probably smaller, meaning that A becomes smaller,
and the ratio H/A grows, resulting in a larger Emag. In principle,
the magnetic energy released from chromospheric reconnection
during ﬂux cancellation is suﬃcient to explain the heating of the
system of loops displayed in Fig. 1.

6. Discussion

Most of the magnetic energy from the ﬂux cancellation events
may already be dissipated low in the atmosphere, heating the
chromosphere, where the energy requirements are even higher

2 We estimate the loop length based on the lateral separation of foot-
points and assuming it to be a semi-circle.
3 This estimate of H is also consistent with three-dimensional MHD
simulations of AR models, which yield a heating scale height below
the corona of about 500 km, i.e. in the chromosphere where the recon-
nection could be triggered (i.e. the heating rate drops every 500 km by
about a factor of 2.71; e.g. Bingert & Peter 2011).

ﬁlters. The green curve representing a quiet Sun region adjacent to the

ing about 15′′ (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, it shares similarities with
the ﬁrst example.

The AR 12234 nanoﬂare is observed as a brightening in all
the AIA EUV ﬁlters including the UV 160 nm ﬁlter. In Fig. 3(a)
we show the 9.4 nm ﬁlter emission map during the reported
nanoﬂare. The light curves from two diﬀerent (east and west)
regions covering the nanoﬂare exhibit large ﬂuctuations (panel
(b)). Clear, almost simultaneous peaks from both the regions at
19:14 UT in the AIA 9.4 nm ﬁlter are co-temporal with the hard
X-ray emission detected by FOXSI1 (Ishikawa et al. 2017). For
comparison, we show the AIA 17.1 nm ﬁlter emission map and
light curves that reveal similar characteristics to the 9.4 nm ﬁlter
(panels (c) and (d)).

The surface magnetic ﬁeld underlying this nanoﬂare (panel
(e)) is qualitatively similar to that near the east footpoint in
Fig. 1. Here we also observe cancellation of the surface mag-
netic ﬂux at a rate of about 1015 Mx s−1 (panel (f)). Therefore,
also in the case of this FOXSI nanoﬂare the coronal brightening
is causally associated with the dynamic evolution of the mag-
netic ﬁeld in the form of ﬂux cancellation at the surface.

5. Energetics of coronal brightenings and ﬂux

cancellation events

Energy released in the process of magnetic reconnection dur-
ing surface magnetic ﬂux cancellation is generally consid-
ered to drive transient coronal brightenings, explosive events,
and plasma jets in the upper solar atmosphere (e.g. Dere et al.
1991; Innes et al. 1997; Chifor et al. 2008; Morita et al. 2010;
Kano et al. 2010; Peter et al. 2014; Tiwari et al. 2014). In both
the cases discussed in Sections 3 and 4, atmospheric bright-
enings associated with the loops are directly overlying regions
of surface magnetic ﬂux cancellation. Recent studies that em-
ploy magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations locate the site of magnetic re-
connection in the chromosphere (at heights of about 500 km–
1000 km) in such ﬂux cancellation events (e.g. Chitta et al.

1 We note that being on a suborbital rocket ﬂight, FOXSI-2 recorded
data for about 6 minutes only and therefore the other peaks we display in
Fig. 3 occurred outside the window of time that FOXSI could observe.

than in the corona (Withbroe & Noyes 1977). However, if the
observed coronal brightenings are indeed inﬂuenced by chromo-
spheric (footpoint) reconnection during the ﬂux cancellation (cf.
Sect. 5), it is expected that some of the released magnetic en-
ergy reaches coronal heights. In this case, the issue of energy
partition between the chromosphere and the corona needs to be
addressed. Alternatively, the observed ﬂux cancellation and foot-
point reconnection can facilitate the release of the stored mag-
netic energy in coronal braids, leading to loop brightening.

Flux cancellation and associated reconnection can shed light
on the spatial structuring (meaning only at speciﬁc locations
in ARs) and temporal intermittency (meaning only at speciﬁc
times) of hot loops observed in ARs (e.g. Webb & Zirin 1981;
Shimizu et al. 1992; Falconer et al. 1997; Ugarte-Urra & Warren
2014). This is because such ﬂux cancellation events, due to their
sparsity, are discrete in space and time, at least on a scale vis-
ible to HMI. We note that the cancellation may in some cases
be associated with previous small-scale ﬂux emergence. Nev-
ertheless, we emphasise that many ﬂux cancellation events (and
related reconnection) need not be associated with coronal bright-
enings due to the inherent lack of magnetic coupling to coronal
heights at the locations of such events. For instance, some of
the low-lying brightenings, such as UV bursts, which also occur

over ﬂux cancellation sites, do not show any coronal counter-
parts (e.g. Peter et al. 2014).

Another interesting aspect to be considered is the near-
simultaneous brightening of two footpoints (which are later-
ally separated by about 100′′) observed in the AIA 9.4 nm ﬁl-
ter (Fig. 1). Using the same observations, Testa et al. (2014) sug-
gested that the brightening in the western footpoints and gentle
upﬂows in the transition region are due to the acceleration of
non-thermal particles in coronal nanoﬂares. Here we reveal on-
going magnetic reconnection at the eastern footpoint, presum-
ably at low heights, that could accelerate non-thermal particles
from the site of chromospheric reconnection. Further observa-
tional analysis is required to build statistics on the presence (or
lack) of these near-simultaneous footpoint brightenings in asso-
ciation with brightenings of hot coronal loops (e.g. Gupta et al.
2018). In addition, it would be interesting to conduct numer-
ical experiments to investigate the role of footpoint reconnec-
tion and the local energy deposition in the generation of a near-
simultaneous signal at both footpoints. This is worthwhile be-
cause any energy transport mechanism (e.g. heat conduction or
non-thermal particles) that is fast enough may eﬃciently trans-
port the energy to the other footpoint within the AIA cadence of
12 s, giving rise to an apparent near-simultaneous signal.

In this study we focus on a scenario of coronal brightenings
in AR cores and their likely association with chromospheric re-
connection during surface magnetic ﬂux cancellation. In princi-
ple, such a scenario might also be applied to the diﬀuse solar
corona in quiet Sun regions. The rate of energy loss from the en-
tire quiet solar corona has been estimated to be about 1028 erg s−1
(Withbroe & Noyes 1977). Parker (1988) proposed nanoﬂares as
a way to energize the quiet corona. With each nanoﬂare provid-
ing on average an energy of 1024 erg, there would have to be
about 104 nanoﬂares at any given time distributed on the Sun to
sustain the quiet corona.

In contrast to the nanoﬂares produced by reconnection dis-
tributed in the corona following energy build-up by braiding,
one could also speculate that the quiet Sun is heated by small
reconnection events at the coronal base associated with ﬂux can-
cellation in the photosphere, similar to our proposal for the AR
cores. In a recent study, Smitha et al. (2017) used high-resolution
magnetic ﬁeld maps and analysed the rate of ﬂux emergence
and cancellation in the quiet Sun from the balloon-borne Sun-
rise telescope (Solanki et al. 2010; Barthol et al. 2011). For the
magnetic features with a ﬂux content in the range of 1015 Mx
to 1018 Mx, they obtain a ﬂux-loss rate (due to ﬂux cancella-
tion) per unit area of about 1150 Mx cm−2 day−1 at the photo-
sphere. This amounts to a ﬂux-loss rate of ˙Φ = 8 × 1020 Mx s−1,
over the entire solar surface. This is a lower limit, as, using an-
other technique, Zhou et al. (2013) obtain a ﬂux-loss rate more
than ﬁve times higher. We now consider that this ﬂux loss leads
to magnetic energy release through reconnection over a height
range of H = 500 km above the photosphere, which corre-
sponds to the temperature minimum level in traditional solar
atmosphere models. Reconnection is most likely at these low
levels as most of the small-scale loops in the quiet Sun do not
reach much higher (Wiegelmann et al. 2010), where the average
magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, is assumed to be in the range of 10 G
– 100 G (e.g. Trujillo Bueno et al. 2004; Danilovic et al. 2016;
Lagg et al. 2016). The rate of magnetic energy release due to
4π B ˙ΦH. The above val-
ﬂux cancellation can be written as ˙E = 1
ues for B, ˙Φ, and H give a lower limit4 for the rate of magnetic
energy release of approximately 1028 − 1029 erg s−1. Comparing
this with the energy requirement of the quiet corona mentioned
above shows that reconnection during small-scale ﬂux cancella-
tion would be suﬃcient to power the quiet corona. These order-
of-magnitude estimates are consistent with previously reported
values in the literature (e.g. Zhou et al. 2010). If and how these
small-scale reconnection events might be related to nanoﬂares is
currently diﬃcult to say due to the limitations in the detectability
of an individual nanoﬂare.

7. Conclusions

We present two examples of recently reported nanoﬂares with
an aim to understand their origin. To this end, we combined the
diagnostics of atmospheric emission during the brightening of
loops driven by nanoﬂares with the evolution of surface mag-
netic ﬁeld. In both the cases we found that the surface magnetic
ﬁeld underlying the brightenings is dynamically evolving with
clear signatures of a monotonic decrease in the magnetic ﬂux (at
a rate of about 1015 Mx s−1), suggesting the release of magnetic
energy through reconnection at one of the apparent footpoints
of the loops hosting the nanoﬂares. The surface evolution of the

4 We note that here we include the contribution of magnetic features
with ﬂuxes in the range of 1015 Mx – 1018 Mx only. Therefore, our en-
ergy estimate should be considered as a lower limit.

magnetic ﬁeld connecting the coronal brightenings highlights a
complex and dynamic magnetic coupling through the solar at-
mosphere that probably governs the energetics of these coronal
structures and, as we speculate, those of many others. We sug-
gest that the energy released in chromospheric reconnection is a
viable source to power AR coronal loops driven by nanoﬂares. A
similar process of chromospheric reconnection during ﬂux can-
cellation would be suﬃcient to power the quiet solar corona.
