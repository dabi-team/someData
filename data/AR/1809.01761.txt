Finite-size particles modulate wall-bounded turbulence, leading for the case of spherical
particles to increased drag also owing to the formation of a particle wall layer. Here, we
study the eﬀect of particle shape on the turbulence in suspensions of spheroidal particles
at volume fraction φ = 10% and show how the near-wall particle dynamics deeply changes
with the particle aspect ratio and how this aﬀects the global suspension behavior. Direct
numerical simulations are performed using a direct-forcing immersed boundary method
to account for the dispersed phase, combined with a soft-sphere collision model and
lubrication corrections for short-range particle-particle and particle-wall interactions.
The turbulence reduces with the aspect ratio of oblate particles, leading to drag reduction
with respect to the single phase ﬂow for particles with aspect ratio AR (cid:54) 1/3, when
the signiﬁcant reduction in Reynolds shear stress is more than the compensation by
the additional stresses, induced by the solid phase. Oblate particles are found to avoid
the region close to the wall, travelling parallel to it with small angular velocities, while
preferentially sampling high-speed ﬂuid in the wall region. Prolate particles, also tend
to orient parallel to the wall and avoid its vicinity. Their reluctancy to rotate around
spanwise axis reduce the wall-normal velocity ﬂuctuation of the ﬂow and therefore the
turbulence Reynolds stress similar to oblates; however, they undergo rotations in wall-
parallel planes which increases the additional solid stresses due to their relatively larger
angular velocities compared to the oblates. These larger additional stresses compensates
for the reduction in turbulence activity and leads to a wall-drag similar to that of single-
phase ﬂows. Spheres on the other hand, form a layer close to the wall with large angular
velocities in spanwise direction, which increases the turbulence activity in addition to
exerting the largest solid stresses on the suspension, in comparison to the other studied
shapes. Spherical particles therefore increase the wall-drag with respect to the single-
phase ﬂow.

1. Introduction

The presence of solid rigid particles in a suspension alters the global transport and
rheological properties of the mixture in complex, and often unpredictable, ways. These
suspensions are relevant as found in many environmental and industrial processes such as
sediment transport in estuaries (Mehta 2014), blood ﬂow in the human body, pyroclastic
ﬂows and pulp ﬁbers in paper making industry (Lundell et al. 2011).

When the Reynolds number is suﬃciently high, the ﬂow becomes turbulent, with
chaotic and multi-scale dynamics. In this regime, any solid object larger than the
smallest scales of the ﬂow can alter the turbulent structures at or below its size (Naso
& Prosperetti 2010), leading to turbulence modulation at large enough volume fractions
(Lucci et al. 2010; Tanaka & Teramoto 2015). Particulate wall-bounded turbulent ﬂows
in the inertial regime have been investigated in recent years mainly for spherical particles
(Matas et al. 2003; Loisel et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2016; Lashgari et al. 2014; Wang et al.
2016). Picano et al. (2015) investigated dense suspensions in turbulent channel ﬂow up
to volume fraction of 20%. Their study revealed that the overall drag increase is due
to the enhancement of the turbulence activity up to a certain volume fraction and to
the particle-induced stresses at higher concentrations. Costa et al. (2016) explained that
the turbulent drag of sphere suspensions is always higher than what predicted by only
accounting for the eﬀective suspension viscosity. They attributed this increase to the
formation of a particle wall layer, a layer of spheres forming near the wall in turbulent
suspensions. Based on the thickness of the particle wall layer, they proposed a relation
able to predict the friction Reynolds number as function of the bulk Reynolds number.
The dynamics of suspension in the presence of ﬁnite-size rigid non-spherical particles
are less understood (Prosperetti 2015), with just a few studies in recent years (Do-Quang
et al. 2014; Ardekani et al. 2017; Eshghinejadfard et al. 2017). In our previous study
(Ardekani et al. 2017), we performed simulations of turbulent channel ﬂow with oblate
spheroids of aspect ratio (polar over equatorial radius), AR = 1/3, up to volume fraction
φ = 15%. We demonstrated that oblate particles induce an overall drag reduction as the
volume fraction φ increases within the investigated range. Turbulence attenuation was
also observed, as opposed to suspensions of spherical particles whose presence increases
the turbulence activity for volume fractions below φ = 20%. Two main mechanisms are
found responsible for drag reduction: i) the absence of a particle wall layer, found to be
responsible for the increased dissipation in suspensions of spheres; ii) the tendency of
oblate particles to remain with their major axes parallel to the wall in its vicinity, thus
shielding the near-wall region from the bulk ﬂow.

Wang (2017) studied spheroidal particles in a turbulent plane Couette ﬂow with aspect
ratios ranging form 0.5 to 2 at 5% volume fraction, revealing that the particle distribution
of spheroids in the ﬂow is not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by their shapes. Eshghinejadfard
et al. (2017) performed simulations of prolate particles up to 1.5% volume fraction in a
turbulent channel ﬂow, showing the disappearance of the particle wall-layer, previously
observed for spheres (Picano et al. 2015) and also slight turbulence attenuation with
respect to the single-phase ﬂow. Finite-size rigid ﬁbers are studied in the work of (Do-
Quang et al. 2014) at low volume fractions around 0.1%. These authors report particle
sampling of high speed regions close to the wall and also turbulence attenuation with
increasing ﬁber length.

Given the importance of particle dynamics on near-wall turbulence, we further inves-
tigate the shape eﬀect by simulating spheroids of diﬀerent aspect ratios AR at φ = 10%,
comparing prolates (AR > 1), spheres (AR = 1) and oblates (AR < 1 ).

2. Methodology

2.1. Governing equations

In this work we employ the numerical model in Ardekani et al. (2016, 2017) to
study dense suspensions of spheroidal particles. This approach is based on the immersed

Turbulence modulation by ﬁnite-size spheroidal particles

boundary method (IBM) initially proposed by Uhlmann (2005); Breugem (2012) for
spherical particles, extended to spheroids as described in Ardekani et al. (2016), including
lubrication, friction and collision models for the short-range particle interactions. In this
scheme, the ﬂow ﬁeld is resolved on a uniform (∆x = ∆y = ∆z), staggered, Cartesian
grid while particles are represented by a set of Lagrangian points, uniformly distributed
on the surface of each particle.
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the ﬂow ﬁeld in the Eulerian phase:

ρf (

∂u
∂t

+ u · ∇u) = −∇p − ∇pe + µf ∇2u + ρf f ,

∇ · u = 0 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

where u is the ﬂuid velocity, ∇pe is the external pressure gradient that drives the ﬂow
with a constant bulk velocity (Ub) of the combined phase, p is the modiﬁed pressure
(the total pressure minus pe) and ρf and µf are the density and dynamic viscosity of
the ﬂuid. The additional term f on the right hand side of equation (2.1) is the IBM
force ﬁeld, active in the immediate vicinity of a particle surface to enforce no-slip and
no-penetration boundary conditions.
The point force Fl is calculated ﬁrst at each Lagrangian point using the diﬀerence between
the particle surface velocity and the interpolated ﬁrst prediction velocity at the same
point. The ﬁrst prediction velocity is obtained by advancing equation (2.1) in time,
using an explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta method, without considering the force ﬁeld f.
The forces, Fl, are then integrated to the force ﬁeld f using the regularized Dirac delta
function δd of Roma et al. (1999) and added to the ﬁrst prediction velocity followed by
the pressure-correction scheme used in Breugem (2012) to project the velocity ﬁeld in
the divergence-free space.
Taking into account the inertia of the ﬁctitious ﬂuid phase, trapped inside the particle vol-
umes, the motion of rigid spheroidal particles are described by Newton-Euler Lagrangian
equations:

with Up and ΩΩΩp the translational and the angular velocity of the particle. ρp, Vp and Ip
are the particle mass density, volume and moment-of-inertia tensor and g is the gravity
vector. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of equations above describes the IBM force
as the summation of all the point forces Fl on the surface of the particle, the second term
accounts for the inertia of the ﬁctitious ﬂuid phase, trapped inside the particle and Fc
and Tc are the force and the torque, acting on the particles, due to the particle-particle
(particle-wall) collisions.
When the distance between particles (or a particle and a wall) are smaller than one
Eulerian grid size, the lubrication force is under-predicted by the IBM. To compensate for
this inaccuracy and to avoid computationally expensive grid reﬁnements, a lubrication
model based on the asymptotic analytical expression for the normal lubrication force
between unequal spheres (Jeﬀrey 1982) is used; here we approximate the two spheroidal
particles with two spheres with same mass and radius corresponding to the local curvature
at the points of contact. Using these approximating spheres, a soft-sphere collision model

found in Ardekani et al. (2016); Costa et al. (2015).

2.2. Flow geometry

We perform direct numerical simulations of pressure-driven, particulate turbulent
channel ﬂow in a computational domain of size Lx = 6h, Ly = 2h and Lz = 3h
in the streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise directions, where h is half the channel
height. The bulk velocity Ub is ﬁxed to guarantee a constant bulk Reynolds number
Reb ≡ 2hUb/ν = 5600, corresponding to an average friction Reynolds number of
Reτ ≡ uτ h/ν ≈ 180 for the single-phase ﬂow (Kim et al. 1987) with ν, the kinematic
viscosity of the ﬂuid phase and uτ , the friction velocity. Diﬀerent aspect ratios AR = 3,
1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5 are simulated at volume fraction φ = 10% and compared to
the single-phase ﬂow at same Reb. We consider non-Brownian neutrally-buoyant rigid
particles of diﬀerent shape and same volume, with equivalent diameter Deq = h/9, (i.e.
the diameter of a sphere of same volume). This corresponds to 5000 particles inside the
computational domain at φ = 10%. The volume fraction is kept constant as it was shown
before that excluded volume eﬀects have the largest role on the turbulence modulation
(Fornari et al. 2016).

The simulations are performed with a resolution of 32 grid points per Deq for the
single-phase ﬂow and the cases with AR = 1, 1/2 & 1/3, whereas a resolution of 48
points per Deq is found necessary to capture the thin boundary layer around the highly
curved particles with AR = 3, 1/4 & 1/5. The number of Lagrangian points NL on the
surface of each particle is NL = 8122, 3219, 3406, 3720, 9120 and 9880 for the cases with
AR = 3, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5. A summary to the simulated cases is given in table 1.
The simulations start from the laminar Poiseuille ﬂow with random distribution of the
particle position and orientation. The noise introduced by the presence of the particles
triggers rapidly the transition to a fully turbulent state, after which the statistics are
collected for about 16 large-eddy turnover times h/uτ . A CFL number of 0.5 is used for
time-stepping to guarantee the numerical stability of the method.

3. Results

In this section we ﬁrst investigate the eﬀect of particles on the drag by computing the
momentum budget, followed by the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget to explain
how particles contribute to the production, transfer and dissipation of TKE, key for
future modelling. Next, the turbulence modulation is documented by focusing on the
ﬂuid phase statistics and, ﬁnally, explained in relation to the particle dynamics.

3.1. Momentum and TKE budget analysis

In particulate turbulent ﬂows, the particle-induced stress also contributes to the mean
momentum transfer in the wall-normal direction, in addition to the viscous and Reynolds
shear stresses. Based on the formulation proposed by Zhang & Prosperetti (2010); Picano
et al. (2015), we can write the mean momentum balance in the channel as:

f v(cid:48)

f (cid:105)(cid:3) + Φ(cid:104)σp

xy(cid:105) ,

(3.1)

where the ﬁrst term on the right hand side is the viscous shear stress, denoted τV , the
second and the third terms are the turbulent Reynolds shear stress of the combined
phase, τT , sum of the separate contributions from the two phases, and the fourth term
the particle-induced stress τP . σp
xy in the equation above indicates the general stress in
the particle phase, normal to streamwise plane and pointing in wall-normal direction,
Φ the mean local solid volume fraction as a function of wall-normal distance y, ρf the
density of the ﬂuid, Uf the mean ﬂuid velocity and u(cid:48) and v(cid:48) are the velocity ﬂuctuations
in the streamwise and wall-normal directions with the subscripts f and p denoting ﬂuid
and particle phases. Note that in the absence of particles (Φ = 0), this equation reduces
to the classic momentum balance for single-phase turbulent channel ﬂow (Pope 2001).
Integrating equation (3.1) from 0 to h and substituting ρf u2
τ with the drag at the wall,
τw, leads to the contribution of each stress to τw, which can be written in discrete form
as:

τw =

2
h

[ΣτV + ΣτT + ΣτP ] .

(3.2)

Each contribution times 2/h, normalized by the drag of the single-phase ﬂow, τwφ=0% ,
is given in ﬁgure 1(a) for the diﬀerent particle aspect ratios considered. An overall
drag reduction is observed for the cases with AR (cid:54) 1/3, increasing up to 10% for the
smallest AR = 1/5. The largest increase with respect to the unladen case is obtained
for spheres, whereas a small drag increase is still observed for AR = 1/2. Finally, the
drag for the case with prolate particles is almost the same as for the single-phase ﬂow.
Considering the diﬀerent contributions, we note the non-monotonic behaviour of the
particle-induced stress with decreasing AR as it reaches a minimum for AR = 1/3
before slightly increasing when further decreasing the aspect ratio. The contribution of
the viscous shear stress to the total drag is slightly varying among the diﬀerent aspect
ratio cases, while being smaller than the single phase ﬂow due to the presence of 1−Φ in τV
of particulate cases. In addition, we see turbulence attenuation for all non-spherical cases,
an eﬀect increasing as the aspect ratio departs from sphericity. The level of turbulence
activity is quantiﬁed by the turbulence Reynolds number ReT ≡ uT h/ν, with uT the
turbulent friction velocity, calculated as the square root of the wall-normal derivative
of the Reynolds stress proﬁle for the combined phase, (cid:104)u(cid:48)
c(cid:105), at the centreline of the
channel:

ReT , normalized by that of the single-phase ﬂow, Re0

T ≈ 174, is depicted in ﬁgure 1(b)
for diﬀerent AR, together with the ratio Reτ /Re0
τ = Reτ /180. The results indicate
that the turbulence activity is decreasing faster than the friction Reynolds number when
decreasing the aspect ratio of oblate particles. This is due to the almost unchanged
contribution of viscous shear stress (ΣτV ) and slight increase of particle-induced stress
when decreasing the aspect ratio below AR = 1/3, meaning that a stronger turbulence
attenuation is required in order to further reduce the drag.

We next consider the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget to quantify the solid-
phase contribution to production and dissipation of TKE of the ﬂuid phase. Considering
the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with the IBM force (f ), employed to impose no-slip
at the particle surface, the TKE budget can be written for a fully developed turbulent
channel ﬂow as:

where the ﬁrst three terms in equation 3.4 are respectively responsible for the spatial
redistribution, viscous dissipation and production of TKE (0.5 (cid:104)u(cid:48)
i(cid:105)) (Mansour et al.
1988), while the fourth term is the interphase energy injection, I = (cid:104)u(cid:48)
jfj(cid:105) (Tanaka &
Teramoto 2015).
The last three terms in equation 3.4 are calculated for the ﬂuid phase, considering only
the points located outside of the volume occupied by the particles (phase-ensemble
average), and depicted for diﬀerent aspect ratios in ﬁgure 1(c). The data indicate a
strong reduction of P in the near-wall region with decreasing AR for oblate particles.
A signiﬁcant reduction is also observed for prolate particles, while a slight increase with
respect to the single-phase ﬂow is seen for spheres. The dissipation term (cid:15) is almost the
same as in the single-phase ﬂow for non-spherical particles, except at the wall where its
value reduces with AR. For spherical particles, however, the dissipation is considerably
larger throughout the channel. The energy injected by the ﬂuid-solid interactions, i.e.
the interphase energy injection at the particle surface, interestingly follows the same
trend as the contribution of particle-induced stresses in the momentum balance (τP in
ﬁgure 1a): it reaches a minimum at AR = 1/3, before increasing again for lower aspect
ratios. The energy injected by the particles ﬁrst decreases when decreasing AR, owing
to the reduced rotation rate discussed below; however, it increases again for the smallest
aspect ratio considered (AR = 1/5) as the particle surface area increases. This can be
explained by the fact that a large value of f indicates a force that acts on the ﬂuid and
also on the surface of the particle, meaning that in the absence of particle’s rigidity,
a large deformation of particle surface would have been expected. Indeed the particle’s
rigidity opposes this deformation and instead increases the particle-induced stress.

3.2. Turbulence modulation

Fluid velocity ﬂuctuations of the ﬂuid phase are depicted in ﬁgure 2(a) for the
diﬀerent particle aspect ratios under investigations. The velocity ﬂuctuations are reduced
compared to the single-phase ﬂow for non-spherical particles in the crossﬂow directions.
The eﬀect is observed to increase as the aspect ratio of oblate particles decreases.
Spherical particles, on the other hand, increase the crossﬂow velocity ﬂuctuations. The
strongest reduction of u(cid:48) is observed for prolates, followed by spheres despite the slight
increase in the core region. Interestingly, u(cid:48) is observed to increase with reducing AR in
the oblate cases. The same behaviour is observed in the literature for other drag reducing
ﬂows, e.g. polymeric ﬂows, when reduced spanwise and wall-normal velocity ﬂuctuations
are observed (Dubief et al. 2004). Figure 2(b) shows the Reynolds shear stress of the
ﬂuid phase for all studied cases. A signiﬁcant turbulence attenuation is observed for non-
spherical particles, as opposed to the turbulence enhancement for spherical particles.
The Reynolds shear stress −u(cid:48)
f v(cid:48)
f decreases monotonically with decreasing AR in the
oblate cases. Interestingly, the −u(cid:48)
f v(cid:48)
f pertaining prolates with AR = 3 is approximately
matching the case of oblates with AR = 1/3.

f > 0, v(cid:48)

The Reynolds shear stresses are then conditionally averaged over each quadrant of the
u(cid:48) −v(cid:48) plane, with Q1 to Q4 referring to the four quadrants. Q2 (ejections: u(cid:48)
f > 0)
and Q4 (sweeps: u(cid:48)
f < 0) events result in turbulence production, while Q1 and
Q3 are responsible for damping. The results of this analysis are depicted in ﬁgure 3(a),
where it is observed that the presence of oblate particles reduces the value of u(cid:48)v(cid:48) over all
four quadrants, with a far more pronounced dampening of the ejection events. Spherical
particles, on the other hand, increase the strength of sweeps close to the wall and reduce
the contribution of Q3 events, without altering the others noticeably. Prolate particles
exhibit an eﬀect similar to oblates, but with lower dampening of the ejections. Similar
analysis is performed, using only the ﬂuid inside the spheroidal shells, 5% larger than
the particles. Q2 and Q4 events, conditionally averaged over these shells are depicted

in ﬁgure 3(b) and 3(c) (dashed lines), respectively and compared against the obtained
results in ﬁgure 3(a). Figure 3(b) shows that the ejection events are strongly attenuated
in the vicinity of the particles compared to the single-phase ﬂow and also compared to
the results in ﬁgure 3(a). The attenuation is observed to be stronger for non-spherical
particles. Interestingly, the results in ﬁgure 3(c) indicate a region near the wall where the
sweeps are strong close to the particles before decreasing below the results of ﬁgure 3(a)
in the middle of the channel. The peak is stronger for spherical and prolate particles and
it decreases with aspect ratio of oblates.

To gain a better understanding of the turbulence structures in the wall region, two-
point spatial correlation of the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations as a function of the
spanwise spacing is computed for diﬀerent wall-normal distances:

Ruu(y, ∆z) =

(cid:104)u(cid:48)(x, y, z, t) u(cid:48)(x, y, z + ∆z, t)(cid:105)
u(cid:48)2

.

(3.8)

Contours of the one-dimensional autocorrelation of the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations
as a function of the spanwise spacing are given in ﬁgure 3 for diﬀerent aspect ratios.
It is well known that the autocorrelations of the streamwise velocity along the spanwise
direction in a single-phase turbulent ﬂow (3(a)), indicate a negative local minimum value
in the near wall region around ∆z+ ≈ 60 (Pope 2001). This value indicates half of
the spacing between the near-wall streamwise low-speed streaks, characteristic of wall-
bounded turbulence. Results in ﬁgure 3 indicate a clear increase in the spacing of these
structures for the oblate particles with AR = 1/5 (3(c)), a characteristic observed in
drag-reducing ﬂows (Dubief et al. 2004); however the low-speed streaks are observed to

spherical ones (3(b)).

3.3. Particle dynamics

Preferential sampling, particle rotation and orientation, especially close to the wall,
can lead to a strong modulation of the turbulence. Here we discuss the link between the
solid-phase averaged data and the drag modiﬁcations and turbulence activity reported
in the previous sections.

The mean local volume fraction, Φ, is depicted versus the wall-normal distance y/h
in ﬁgure 5(a). Interestingly, a peak close to the wall is only observed for the spherical
particles. This peak corresponds to a layer of particles that form due to the wall-particle
interactions (Picano et al. 2015) and is partially responsible for the increase of drag in this
case (Costa et al. 2016). Non spherical-particles are observed to avoid the wall; the local
volume fraction proﬁles for disc-like particles seem to converge for AR (cid:54) 1/3. To better
understand this, we report in ﬁgure 5(b) the average particle orientation throughout the
channel. The orientation is measured as the cosine of the inclination angle θ, which is
the smallest angle between the spheroid axis of symmetry and the normal to the wall.
The data clearly show the strong tendency for oblate and prolate particles to have their
largest semi-axis parallel to the wall. The alignment of prolate particles with the wall in
its vicinity is also observed in the studies of Eshghinejadfard et al. (2017); Wang (2017),
similar to rigid ﬁbres in the work of Do-Quang et al. (2014). An arbitrary symmetry axis
is chosen for spheres to demonstrate the sphere random orientation. The magnitude of
the angular velocity vector ΩΩΩp, normalized by Ub/h, is depicted for the diﬀerent aspect
ratios in ﬁgure 5(c): the angular velocities drastically decrease for oblate particles. Prolate
particles, similarly to spheres, display a non-negligible angular velocity; this large value
is mainly due to the wall-normal component of the angular velocity Ω(cid:48)y
p, depicted in
ﬁgure 5(f ) for diﬀerent aspect ratios. Prolate particles are observed to have the largest
wall-normal angular velocity in the vicinity of the wall, while this value is signiﬁcantly
smaller for oblate particles and decreasing with their aspect ratio. Spherical particles also
experience noticeably smaller wall-normal angular velocity close to the wall, however they
have the largest in the middle of the channel. Conversely, in the case of spherical particles,
the major contribution to the angular velocity is due to the mean spanwise component
Ωz
p, as a direct consequence of the mean shear. The mean spanwise angular velocities
for diﬀerent aspect ratios are given in ﬁgure 5(e). Larger angular velocities result in a
larger particle-induced stress as the rotation of particles larger than the smallest scale of
the ﬂow opposes stretch and deformation. To better distinguish the eﬀect of mean ﬂow
and ﬂuctuations on the dynamics of particles, we have simulated the behavior of single
particles kept at a ﬁxed distance from the wall (y/h = 0.1) in the laminar ﬂow deﬁned
by the turbulent proﬁle. These additional runs (not shown in the ﬁgure) show that a
sphere tends to a constant angular velocity in the spanwise direction, oblate particle with
AR = 1/2 exhibits a periodic spanwise angular velocity, with the majority of time spent
parallel to the wall, and, more interestingly, the motion of particles with AR = 1/3, 1/4,
1/5 and 3 converges to zero angular velocity with the broad side approximately parallel
to the wall (slightly tilted). The tendency of non-spherical particles to remain parallel to
the wall is therefore a mean ﬂow eﬀect and quenches eﬀectively the velocity ﬂuctuations,
resulting in turbulence attenuation. This mechanism is more eﬀective when the particles
are larger than the turbulence structures. The role of the particle size can be deduced
from the results in ﬁgure 5: local volume fraction, particle rotation and orientation attain
similar values for oblates with AR (cid:54) 1/3, however the turbulence attenuation increases
for broader oblates. This can also be concluded from ﬁgure 5(d), where the magnitude of
the particle velocity ﬂuctuations, normalized by Ub is shown to decrease with AR. The
local velocity of the solid phase are computed, taking into account the rigid body motion
of the particles, up + ΩΩΩp × (x − xc), with x and xc denoting an arbitrary point inside
the particle and the particle center respectively.

Finally, we examine the probability density function (PDF) of the streamwise ﬂuid
velocity ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of the particles and in a region close to the wall
(0.1 < y/h < 0.2), see ﬁgure 6(a). The ﬂuid velocity ﬂuctuations relative to each particle
are the average on the spheroidal shell 5% larger than the particle itself. The data

indicate a clear tendency for particles to sample high-speed regions close to the wall.
This observed preferential sampling is weakest for spheres, followed by prolates and more
and more evident when decreasing the aspect ratio of oblate particles. Figure 6(b) shows
the diﬀerence in the mean particle Up and ﬂuid Uf velocity: the diﬀerence in the region
y/h < 0.2 is consistent with the PDF reported in ﬁgure 6(a). It should be noted that the
larger mean velocity of the particles, compared to the ﬂuid phase does not necessarily
indicate a large slip velocity as particles are shown to have a tendency to sample the high
speed regions close to the wall. The larger mean velocity of the particles close to the wall
is consistent with the results of Picano et al. (2015) for spherical particles and Do-Quang
et al. (2014); Ardekani et al. (2017); Eshghinejadfard et al. (2017) for non-spherical ones.

4. Final remarks

We have reported results from the simulations of turbulent channel ﬂow of suspensions
of ﬁnite-size spheroidal particles with diﬀerent aspect ratios AR = 3, 1, 1/2, 1/3,
1/4 and 1/5 at volume fraction φ = 10%. By computing the contribution of the
viscous, Reynolds and particle-induced shear stresses to the momentum transfer we show
turbulence attenuation (with respect to the single-phase ﬂow) for all the studied cases,
except for spheres where an increase in the turbulence activity is observed. The turbulent
Reynolds stresses reduce with the aspect ratio of oblate particles, i.e. for ﬂatter disc-like
particles. Overall drag reduction with respect to the single phase ﬂow is observed for
the oblate particles with AR (cid:54) 1/3, once the turbulence attenuation is large enough
to compensate the particle-induced stresses; in the cases with AR = 1/2 and 3, on the
contrary, the reduction in the turbulence activity (Reynolds shear stress) is lower than
the additional stress induced by the particles. Particle-induced stress is found to be a
function of particle rotation, since rotation comes as a consequence of opposing stretch
and deformation, and therefore increasing the additional stress induced by the solid
phase. In particular, the drag is shown to increase signiﬁcantly for spherical particles
and slightly for oblates with AR = 1/2, while no relevant drag modiﬁcation is reported
for the case of prolate particles. Diﬀerent mechanisms are found in this study to explain
how the dynamics of spherical, oblate and prolate particles modulate the turbulence close
to the wall.

Spheres form a layer close to the wall, rotating with high spanwise angular velocity.
Their rotation brings high momentum ﬂow towards the wall, increasing the strength of

sweep events (ﬁgure 3a) and therefore increasing the turbulence activity. Flow ﬁled in
the vicinity of the particles is shown in ﬁgure 3c to generate strong sweep events close to
the wall. The presence of a particle-layer close to the wall also results in noisier low and
high-speed streaks (ﬁgure 4b).

Prolate particles are oriented with their major axis parallel to the wall, experiencing a
signiﬁcant wall-normal angular velocity due to the velocity ﬂuctuations. Their rotation
creates momentum mixing in the streamwise-spanwise plane, which results in the disrup-
tion of the near-wall low-speed streaks, see ﬁgure 4d. In this way, prolate particles reduce
the peak of streamwise and spanwise velocity ﬂuctuations and reduce the wall-normal
ﬂuctuations as they resist rotations in the spanwise direction.

Oblate particles tend to be parallel to the wall, while also avoiding its vicinity and
experiencing signiﬁcantly smaller angular velocities with respect to the other shapes
considered. They sample high-speed regions close to the wall, increasing the spacing
between the low-speed streaks (ﬁgure 4c). These particles create a strong shield that
decreases the turbulent activity by resisting rotation and therefore dampen the velocity
ﬂuctuations. Preferential sampling, rotation and orientation of oblate particles converge
to similar values for oblates with AR (cid:54) 1/3, however the turbulence attenuation
continues to increase due to their larger major-axis.
