ABSTRACT

X-ray lines of helium-like calcium (Ca XIX) between 3.17 Å and 3.21 Å and

associated Ca XVIII dielectronic satellites have previously been observed in solar

ﬂare spectra, and their excitation mechanisms are well established. Dielectronic

satellites of lower ionization stages (Ca XVII – Ca XV) are not as well character-

ized. Several spectra during a large solar ﬂare in 2001 by the DIOGENESS X-ray

spectrometer on the CORONAS-F spacecraft show the Ca XVII and Ca XVI

satellites as well as lines of ionized argon (Ar XVII, Ar XVI) including dielec-

tronic satellites. The DIOGENESS spectra are compared with spectra from a

synthesis code developed here based on an isothermal assumption with various

atomic sources including dielectronic satellite data from the Cowan Hartree–Fock

code. Best-ﬁt comparisons are made by varying the temperature as the code’s in-

put (Ar/Ca abundance ratio ﬁxed at 0.33); close agreement is achieved although

with adjustments to some ion fractions. The derived temperature is close to that

derived from the two GOES X-ray channels, TGOES. Some lines are identiﬁed for

the ﬁrst time. Similar spectra from the P78-1 spacecraft and the Alcator C-Mod

tokamak have also been analyzed and similar agreement obtained. The impor-

tance of blends of calcium and argon lines is emphasized, aﬀecting line ratios used

for temperature diagnostics. This analysis will be applied to the Solar Maximum

Mission Bent Crystal Spectrometer archive and to X-ray spectra expected from

the ChemiX instrument on the Sun-orbiting Interhelioprobe spacecraft, while the

relevance to X-ray spectra from non-solar sources is indicated.

INTRODUCTION

Highly ionized calcium X-ray spectra have been observed by several instruments on solar

spacecraft, particularly those dedicated to the study of high-temperature ﬂare-produced

plasmas. Lines due to helium-like Ca (Ca XIX) in the wavelength range 3.17 – 3.21 Å occur

in ﬂares with GOES classiﬁcations C1 and higher, and with temperatures of up to ∼ 20 MK.

Ca XIX spectra were recorded by SOLFLEX (Solar Flare X-rays) on P78-1 (operating

1979 – 1981), the Bent Crystal Spectrometer on Solar Maximum Mission (1980 and

1984 – 1989), and the Bragg Crystal Spectrometer on Yohkoh (1991 – 2001), time periods

coinciding with the high-activity maxima of Solar Cycles 21 and 22, when unlike much of

the most recent cycle (24) GOES class M and X ﬂares were commonplace. The Ca XIX lines

include the resonance line (line w, 3.17735 Å: notation of Gabriel (1972)), intercombination

lines (x, 3.18941 Å; y, 3.19291 Å), and forbidden line (z, 3.21095 Å) (quoted wavelengths are

from SOLFLEX measurements: Seely & Doschek (1989)). Prominent dielectronic satellites

emitted by Li-like Ca (Ca XVIII) occur near the Ca XIX lines, with wavelengths mostly

between lines w and z. Other dielectronic satellites, emitted by Li-like Ca (Ca XVII), have

been observed in solar ﬂare spectra by SOLFLEX as well as from high-temperature plasmas

in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak device (Rice et al. 2014, 2015, 2017).

Here we discuss a very large (GOES class X5.3) ﬂare on 2001 August 25 observed by

the DIOGENESS scanning crystal spectrometer on the CORONAS-F spacecraft. Scans

were made over the complete duration of the ﬂare with two of the four channels covering the

wavelength region of the Ca XIX lines and Ca XVIII satellites. The spectra were averaged

over ﬁve time periods each with similar temperature, deﬁned by TGOES derived from the

emission ratio of the two channels of GOES ; details are described in Section 2. During

the ﬂare decay stage, when the temperature was lower, lines of lower ionization stages are

also evident as are lines of H-like and He-like argon (Ar XVIII, Ar XVII) and associated

– 4 –

dielectronic satellites. We compare the observed spectra with isothermal synthetic spectra

over the 3.05 – 3.35 Å range generated by a purpose-written code, developed for this work

and described in Section 3, based on various published sources and new calculations of

calcium and argon satellite lines made with the Cowan Hartree–Fock atomic code (Cowan

1981). A grid of spectra with a large range of input electron temperatures Te allowed this

comparison to be made. The averaged DIOGENESS spectra over the ﬁve temperature

intervals were compared with the synthetic spectra calculated for temperature equal to

TGOES (Section 4). Most of the spectral features are reproduced with high accuracy although

the lower-temperature Ca XVII lines were found to be more intense than calculated. This

is attributed to uncertainties in the very small Ca+16 ion fractions at these temperatures;

increasing these then gives much improved agreement. Justiﬁcation for this adjustment is

provided by trial calculations in which the eﬀect of 10% uncertainties in the ionization and

recombination rates on the ion fractions are examined (paper in preparation).

A number of spectral line features – dielectronic satellites of Ca and Ar ions – not

previously noted are observed and identiﬁed in the DIOGENESS spectra. The synthetic

spectra are also compared with published spectra from SOLFLEX during solar ﬂares and

with highly ionized calcium spectra obtained from the Alcator C-Mod tokamak device.

The present analysis will be applied to solar ﬂare spectra in the SMM data archive and to

spectra expected from the crystal spectrometer ChemiX (Siarkowski et al. 2016), which is

part of the payload of the Sun-orbiting Interhelioprobe spacecraft, to be launched in 2025

or 2026.

2. DIOGENESS SPECTRA

2.1. DIOGENESS Instrument and Calibration

The CORONAS-F spacecraft was operational between 2001 and 2006, and had a

near-polar orbit with period 94.9 minutes, with up to 35-minute spacecraft night periods

and occasional interruptions due to passages through enhanced particle radiation associated

with the South Atlantic Anomaly and auroral oval regions near each pole. The bent crystal

spectrometer RESIK (REntgenovsky Spektrometr s Izognutymi Kristalami) built by the

Space Research Centre (SRC) group obtained solar ﬂare spectra in the 3.36 – 6.05 Å

range which have been extensively used for element abundance determinations and

other investigations (see Sylwester et al. (2005, 2012) and references therein). The SRC

companion DIOGENESS instrument operated for only a few weeks at the beginning of the

spacecraft mission, 2001 August 16 to September 17, but in its short lifetime it observed

several large ﬂares (for ﬂare list and instrumental details, see Sylwester et al. (2015b))

including an X5.3 ﬂare on 2001 August 25 (SOL2001-08-25T16:45), one of the largest

in Solar Cycle 23. DIOGENESS consisted of four quartz crystals mounted on a single

rotatable shaft that were rocked back and forth during the observations. Thus, X-rays from

a solar ﬂare were incident at various angles θ, giving diﬀraction at wavelengths λ according

to Bragg’s law λ = 2d sin θ for ﬁrst-order diﬀraction (d is the crystal lattice spacing and

is equal to 6.6855 Å for the quartz crystals used). The diﬀracted radiation was detected

by double proportional counters, with calibration sources illuminating the rear section of

each detector. This type of double proportional counter arrangement was previously used

for X-ray detection in solar instruments aboard the Prognoz and Interball-tail satellites

constructed by the SRC group. Channels 2 and 3 of DIOGENESS covered narrow

wavelength bands around the resonance lines of S XV (5.04 Å) and Si XIII (6.65 Å)

respectively. The August 25 ﬂare spectra discussed here were obtained by channels 1 and

– 6 –

4, including lines of He-like Ca (Ca XIX) with nearby Ca XVIII dielectronic satellite lines

(3.17 – 3.21 Å); the wavelength ranges were 3.12 – 3.32 Å (channel 1) and 3.04 – 3.24 Å

(channel 4), so the overlapping region (3.12 – 3.24 Å) included the Ca XIX lines. In some

spectra, an Fe XXV emission line in second order diﬀraction, at 3.1463 Å, is apparent.

Channels 1 and 4 were arranged in a “Dopplerometer” mode, i.e., with the two crystals (of

quartz 10¯11) facing each other such that spatial displacements of the ﬂare emitting region

could be distinguished from spectral shifts due to Doppler motions.

An absolute intensity calibration was ﬁrst established, with the instrument’s eﬀective

area Aeﬀ (cm2) given by

Aeﬀ = Awindow × κwindow × Edet × Rint ,

(1)

where Awindow is the detector window area, κwindow and Edet are the absorption coeﬃcients

of the beryllium window and detector gas respectively, and Rint the integrated reﬂectivity

of the crystal. Although no pre-launch measurements were made of the detectors, data are

available from measurements made on identical ﬂight spares, giving for the Ca XIX line w

wavelength (3.176 Å) κwindow = 0.78, Awindow = 0.2854 ± 0.006 cm2, and Edet = 0.57. An

on-line X-ray optics toolkit (XOP: Sanchez del Rio & Dejus (2004)) was used to evaluate

Rint, which was found to be 3.4 × 10−5 at 3.17 Å for quartz 10¯11 crystal (a re-measured

value of a ﬂight spare crystal gave 4.0 × 10−5). The resulting value of Aeﬀ at 3.17 Å was

determined to be 4.31 × 10−6 cm2, with an estimated uncertainty of 20%. The rotational

scanning speed was 56 arcmin s−1 and data gathering interval 0.40125 s.

2.2. DIOGENESS Spectra

Figure 1 (top panel) shows the time variations in the photon count rate of DIOGENESS

channels 1 and channel 4, and the GOES 1 − 8 Å irradiance (black curve) during the

August 25 ﬂare over the period 16:09 – 17:50 UT. A small precursor apparent in both the

DIOGENESS and GOES data occurred at 16:17 UT, followed by a sharp rise (16:26 –

16:34 UT) to maximum which occurred at about 16:45 UT. The impulsive stage during this

sharp rise is marked by hard X-ray (53 − 93 keV) emission observed by the Yohkoh Hard

X-ray Telescope. The ﬂare decay, with a short minor burst at 17:35 UT, was observed by

DIOGENESS until 17:50 UT. A gap in the DIOGENESS data at 16:42 – 16:48 UT is due

to a brief loss of telemetry. The DIOGENESS data points show peaks corresponding to

the Ca XIX spectral line group as the spectrometer drive scanned back and forth over its

range in a period of ∼ 140 s. Some 64 channel 1 and 4 spectra were obtained. The lower

panel of this ﬁgure shows the temperature TGOES derived from the ratio of emission in the

two GOES channels averaged over short time intervals (indicated by horizontal error bars)

with standard deviations (vertical error bars). Yohkoh HXT and Soft X-ray Telescope

(SXT) images of the ﬂare, which was located in the south–east part of the solar disk (S17

E34), were shown by Sylwester et al. (2015b). The fast-changing morphology of the sources

during the initial phase of this ﬂare is discussed by Siarkowski & Falewicz (2004).

As some of the 64 DIOGENESS spectra have low or medium statistical signiﬁcance,

channel 1 and 4 spectra were combined and averaged over time periods that correspond

to ﬁve intervals when the derived TGOES (in MK) was in the ranges 12–13, 13–14, 14–16,

16–18, and 18–21, with average values (MK) of 12.8, 13.4, 14.8, 16.8, and 20.7. They are

shown as logarithmic plots in Figure 2 in spectral irradiance units (photon cm−2 s−1 Å−1)

using the calibration data of Section 2.1 (spectra for TGOES > 12.8 MK are increased by 0.5

in the logarithm for clarity); the spectral irradiances were divided by the emission measure

– 8 –

EMGOES derived from TGOES. The ﬁve intervals exclude the initial ﬂare rise since the

plasma conditions could be non-stationary and non-equilibrium. The background in each of

the spectra shown is due to ﬂuorescence and secondary emissions related to magnetospheric

high-energy particles; analysis of the spectra included this background to preserve as far

as possible the integrity of low-intensity spectral features discussed further in this work.

The spectral range of channel 1 includes not only the Ca XIX lines and Ca XVIII satellites

but also satellites due to lower ionization stages on the long-wavelength side of Ca XIX

line z. The short-wavelength part of the channel 4 range includes Ar XVII (1s2 − 1snp,

n = 5, 6, 7, 8: called here w5, w6, w7, and w8) and Ar XVIII (Lyβ) lines. Dielectronic

satellites associated with these lines are also evident, as we shall discuss later.

3. SYNTHETIC SPECTRA

3.1. Calculation

The chianti (v. 8) atomic database and code (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2006) allow

the calculation of Ca XIX spectra and Ca XVIII dielectronic satellites, although reﬁnements

to the Ca XIX line intensities and also satellites from Ca XVII and lower ionization stages

are not included. These satellites are important in the August 25 ﬂare spectra, so for the

purpose of this study we chose to synthesize spectra using a specially written program in

Interactive Data Language (IDL), incorporating atomic data from various sources. The

calculated spectra include the principal Ca XIX lines, which dominate the spectrum, and

dielectronic satellites of Ca XVIII, Ca XVII, Ca XVI, and Ca XV. These satellites are mostly

due to 1s − 2p transitions in the presence of spectator (non-participating) electrons. Lines

of He-like Ar (Ar XVII) lines (w4, w5, w6, and w7) and the Ar XVIII 1s − 3p (Lyβ) line

were included, as were associated Ar XVI and Ar XVII dielectronic satellites.

– 11 –

A grid of synthetic spectra in the range 3.00 – 3.35 Å based on calculated line and

continuum intensities was constructed for temperatures log Te = 6.48−8.0 (Te = 3−100 MK)

in 0.02 dex steps and further interpolated in steps of 0.1 MK. Spectra in this grid were

compared with observed spectra during the August 25 ﬂare for deducing temperatures on

an isothermal assumption. A value of emission measure, N 2

e V (Ne = electron density,

V = emitting volume), was derived from the factor that the synthetic spectrum in spectral

irradiance units is multiplied by in order to agree with the observed spectrum. An

isothermal assumption is valid for the observed spectra shown in Figure 2, which exclude

those in the initial sharp rise in emission. Ionization equilibrium was assumed as is justiﬁed

for ﬂare plasma densities except when the temperature is rapidly changing. Ion fractions as

a function of temperature were taken from chianti v. 8 (Del Zanna et al. 2015) (these are

very close to those of Bryans et al. (2009)). From observations with the SMM Bent Crystal

Spectrometer (Sylwester et al. 1998), the Ca abundance is known to vary from ﬂare to ﬂare;

the average value, A(Ca) = 6.76 (log scale with A(H) = 12), was taken for the calculated

spectra and for the observed August 25 spectra. For the argon abundance, we took

A(Ar) = 6.45 based on an extensive analysis of RESIK ﬂare observations (Sylwester et al.

2010a). Thus the Ar/Ca abundance ratio is 0.33, which is less than the photospheric ratio

(0.87: Asplund et al. (2009)), but is accounted for by an expected factor-of-three or more

enhancement of elements with low (. 10 eV) ﬁrst ionization potentials (FIPs) including

calcium but not argon (see Phillips et al. (2008), chapter 11).

3.2. Ca XIX Lines

The principal lines of He-like Ca (Ca XIX) are w (1s2 1S0 − 1s2p 1P1), x (1s2 1S0 −

1s2p 3P2), y (1s2 1S0 − 1s2p 3P1), and z (1s2 1S0 − 1s2p 3S1). The excitation of these lines

is principally by electron collisions; here we used excitation rates from the distorted wave

– 12 –

calculations of Bely-Dubau et al. (1982). These include excitation by recombination from

H-like Ca, important at relatively high temperatures (e.g., ∼ 21% contribution to line z

at 20 MK), and ionization of Li-like Ca, important at the few per cent level for line z at

relatively low (. 5 MK) temperatures. We used the wavelengths of Ca XIX lines from

Seely & Doschek (1989), measured from SOLFLEX spectra.

Since the Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) work on Ca XIX collision strength calculations,

more detailed close-coupling collision strengths have become available, so comparison with

these should be made. The close-coupling calculations of Whiteford et al. (2001) are those

used in the chianti software package for the Ca XIX lines, and include radiation damping

of the auto-ionizing resonances that are more important for the excitation of Ca XIX lines x,

y, and z. The more recent work of Aggarwal & Keenan (2012) shows some diﬀerences from

Whiteford et al. (2001) although these are only important for ultraviolet transitions. A

comparison of the Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) collision strengths for energies between 400 Ry

and 800 Ry and those of Aggarwal & Keenan (2012) shows diﬀerences that are extremely

small, of order 1%, for excitation to the upper level of line w, and only a few percent for

other transitions. The largest diﬀerence (up to 6%) is for excitation to the upper level of

line y. Thus, use of the Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) collision strength data rather than the

close-coupling data should result in negligible diﬀerences to calculated spectra.

3.3. Ca XVIII – Ca XV Dielectronic Satellites

The theory of the formation of dielectronic satellite lines is given by Gabriel (1972)

and applied to Ca XVIII satellites by Bely-Dubau et al. (1982), so we give only brief details

here. A Ca XVIII satellite line is formed by the dielectronic capture of a free electron by the

He-like ion Ca+18 resulting in a doubly excited state of the Li-like ion Ca+17:

– 13 –

Ca+18(1s2) + e− ⇆ Ca+17(1s 2p nl) → Ca+17(1s2 nl).

(2)

The doubly excited state may de-excite either radiatively or by auto-ionization to Ca+18 and

a free electron (hence the double arrow in Equation 2). If there is radiative de-excitation,

satellite lines in the transition array 1s2 nl − 1s 2p nl result. The principal n = 2 − 4

dielectronic lines cover the wavelength range 3.175 – 3.269 Å; for increasing n, the satellites

converge on the Ca XIX lines.

Following Gabriel (1972), the satellite line irradiance at the distance of the Earth (Is:

photon cm−2 s−1) is

Is =

Ne N(Ca+18) V
4π (au)2

2.06 × 10−16 Fs exp (−Es/kB Te)
3/2
g1T
e

[photons cm

(3)

where Es is the excitation energy of the line’s upper state above the ground state of the

He-like ion and g1 the statistical weight of the ground level (1s2 1S0) of Ca+18 (so g1 = 1).
kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and N(Ca+19) is the number density of He-like Ca ions. The

satellite intensity factor Fs is given by

Fs =

gsAr Aa
Aa + ΣAr ,

(4)

where Ar and Aa are transition probabilities from the satellite’s upper state by radiation

and autoionization respectively and gs the statistical weight of the upper level of the

satellite line transition. The summation is of radiative transition probabilities from the

upper state to all possible lower states.

Values of Fs and wavelengths for the Ca XVIII satellites are available from

Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) and a number of other works (e.g., Vainshtein & Safronova

– 14 –

(1978)). Here, for consistency with calculations of satellites of lower ionization stages,

apart from a few exceptions we used the Cowan Hartree–Fock atomic code (Cowan 1981)

to calculate the necessary data. This code was run previously in studies we made of X-ray

dielectronic satellites of Li-like K and Cl seen with the RESIK instrument (Sylwester et al.

2010b, 2011). The code1, outlined in Cowan (1981) (Chapters 8 and 16) and described in

more detail by Merts et al. (1976), calculates energy levels and radiative and autoionization

probabilities using Slater–Condon theory with pseudo-relativistic corrections. It has been

adapted for personal computers (A. Kramida, private communication, 2014) which was

how the code was run for this work. The code accepts input for a given satellite line array

with scale factors for Slater parameters, speciﬁed in recent updates to the program; the

output includes values for excitation energies, wavelengths, oscillator strengths, transition

probabilities, and Fs for optically allowed transitions. This restriction excludes the Ca XVIII

satellites o and p (3.2688 Å, 3.2636 Å) for which the transitions are optically forbidden;

for these we used the data of Bely-Dubau et al. (1982). The Cowan calculations were

carried out for Ca XVIII satellite arrays 1s2 nl − 1s2p nl with n up to 6 and all possible

l values. The absolute wavelengths are stated by Merts et al. (1976) to be accurate to

about 0.2% for transitions considered here, i.e., about 6 mÅ. Our calculations of absolute

wavelengths indicate a higher precision is achieved; the Cowan wavelengths are generally

less than both those of Seely & Doschek (1989) measured from P78-1 SOLFLEX spectra

and those of Rice et al. (2014) measured from Alcator C-Mod tokamak spectra by an

amount ∆λ between 2 mÅ and 4 mÅ, with an average value of ∆λ = 3.2 mÅ. This

amount was added to the Cowan wavelengths in the synthesis code. It was checked with

runs of the Cowan code for satellites with very high n which converge on the Ca XIX

– 15 –

lines w, x, and y, giving ∆λ ≈ 3 mÅ. An exception is the medium-importance satellite

m for which the Cowan wavelength (3.1926 Å) is more than the calculated wavelengths

of Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) (3.1880 Å) and Vainshtein & Safronova (1978) (3.1890 Å) by

about 4 mÅ. Laser plasma X-ray wavelength measurements by Feldman et al. (1974) for

various He-like ion spectra show that the wavelength is near that of Bely-Dubau et al.

(1982), and accordingly this wavelength was adopted here. Note that in all solar and

Alcator spectra, the highest-intensity satellite j is indistinguishable from Ca XIX line z.

Satellites of Ca XVII, Ca XVI, and Ca XV were similarly calculated with the Cowan

code. These satellites occur to the long-wavelength side of Ca XIX line z (& 3.21 Å). Their

intensities are given by Equations (3) and (4) with g1 = 2 for Ca XVII satellites (excitation

from the ground level 1s2 2s 2S1/2 of Ca+17 with statistical weight 2), 1 for Ca XVI

(excitation from 1s2 2s2 1S0 of Ca+16), and 2 for Ca XV (excitation from 1s2 2s2 2p 2P1/2

of Ca+15). Several Ca XVII satellites are particularly prominent in the DIOGENESS solar

spectra as well as in the ﬂare spectra of Seely & Doschek (1989) and the Alcator spectra of

Rice et al. (2014); we took the measured wavelengths of these from Seely & Doschek (1989).

(Lines with identical transitions are also seen in solar ﬂare Fe XXIII spectra: Lemen et al.

(1984).) The Cowan wavelengths for the same lines are smaller by ∼ 3 mÅ, i.e., a similar

amount to that of the Ca XVIII satellites, so for the remaining satellites, 3.2 mÅ was added

to the Cowan wavelengths.

Table 1 gives data for important lines of calcium ions included in the spectral synthesis

program, including line notation and transitions, wavelengths adopted and measured

(Seely & Doschek (1989); Rice et al. (2014)). The line notation is from Gabriel (1972) for

the Ca XIX and Ca XVIII lines, and from Seely & Doschek (1989) for the Ca XVII satellite

features seen in SOLFLEX spectra. Table 1 also gives, for the dielectronic satellites, values of

Fs from the Cowan program and for comparison values from either Vainshtein & Safronova

– 16 –

(1978) or Safronova & Lisina (1979). Approximately 2000 other weaker satellites of calcium

ions are included in the program. There is ∼ 10% agreement between the Cowan Fs

values and those of Vainshtein & Safronova (1978) or Safronova & Lisina (1979) for the

more intense satellites (Fs & 1014 s−1); for weaker satellites, a factor-of-two agreement

is more typical. Such errors should not aﬀect the general appearance of the spectrum.

Note that neither this table, nor our calculations, includes the Fe XXV line (transition

1s2 1S0 − 1s3p 1P1) with wavelength 1.5731 Å (observed in second diﬀraction order at

3.1463 Å) which is apparent in high-temperature DIOGENESS spectra.

Inner-shell excitation is signiﬁcant for several Ca XVIII satellites, notably o − v. For

these satellites, we used the collisional excitation rates calculated by Bely-Dubau et al.

(1982). The excitation of the Ca XVII β line (transition 1s2 2s2 1S0 − 1s 2s2 2p 1P1) is also

signiﬁcant, but no published data for the collision excitation rates currently exist. However,

temperature-averaged collision strengths for this and the 1s2 2s2 1S0 − 1s 2s2 2p 3P1

transition have been calculated by Mann (1983) for Fe XXIII, the equivalent Fe ion.

Z-scaling laws (Z = atomic number) given by Burgess & Tully (1992) were used to

calculate temperature-averaged collision strengths for Ca XVII line β, from which excitation

rates were derived. For a broad temperature range, the dielectronic and inner-shell

contributions to this line are comparable. Although the Fs value used here diﬀers from that

of Safronova & Lisina (1979) (Table 1), there is little eﬀect on the total intensity of this

line. Inner-shell contributions to some other Ca XVI and Ca XV lines are possible but are

much smaller and have been neglected.

The convergence of the high-n satellites calculated here is illustrated by Figure 3,

showing the summed contribution of satellites with n = 3, 4, 5, and 6 near Ca XIX line

w calculated for T = 13.8 MK. For this temperature, we estimate that the total emission

within 1.15 mÅ of the central wavelength of Ca XIX line w, 8.6% is due to unresolved

– 17 –

n = 3 satellites, 1.4% to n = 4 satellites, 2.3% to n = 5 satellites, and 2.1% to n = 6

satellites. Using the data of Bely-Dubau et al. (1982), the contribution of n > 7 satellites is

approximately 1.6%.

3.4. Ar XVII and Ar XVIII lines and satellites

The Ar XVIII Lyβ and the Ar XVII w4, w5, w6, w7, and (very weakly) w8 lines are

evident in the higher-temperature DIOGENESS spectra and are included in Table 1. We

used chianti v. 8 for the intensities of the w4 and w5 lines and Rice et al. (2017) from

Alcator C-Mod tokamak spectra measurements and theory for the line wavelengths. Ar XVI

dielectronic satellites associated with the Ar XVII w4 – w8 lines, although relatively weak,

are relevant for analysis of DIOGENESS spectra as some blend with the Ca XIX line group.

The Ar XVI satellites have transitions 1s2nl − 1snln′l′ where nl are quantum numbers for

the spectator electron and with n′ (the principal quantum number of the jumping electron)

equal to 4 to 8. They have been observed and analyzed in Alcator C-Mod tokamak plasma

spectra (Rice et al. 2014, 2015), with calculations of wavelengths and intensity factors Fs

given by Rice et al. (2017). Generally, two of the most intense Ar XVI satellite transitions,
with transitions 1s2 2p 2P1/2 − 1s 2p n′p 2D3/2 and 1s2 2p 2P3/2 − 1s 2p n′p 2D5/2, dominate,

making up what is essentially a single line feature (called by Rice et al. (2017) A4, A5, A6,
A7, A8 for n′ = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: this notation is used in Table 1). Here, wavelengths and Fs
values were calculated for these and other satellites with n′ up to 12 using the Cowan code,

with 3.2 mÅ added to the Cowan wavelengths as with the calcium satellites. As can be seen

from Table 1, there is good agreement for both the wavelengths and Fs factors between

the Cowan values and those of Rice et al. (2017) for the A4 to A8 satellites. Additional

Ar XVI satellite data were calculated with the Cowan code for satellites having transitions

1s22l − 1s 2l nl with nl up to 12p. Wavelengths and Fs values of the Ar XVII dielectronic
satellites (transitions 1s2s − 2s3p, 1s2p − 2p3p) associated with the Ar XVIII Lyβ were

similarly calculated with the Cowan code and included in the synthetic spectra. Even the

most intense of these satellites were found to make a very small contribution to the total

spectrum.

– 23 –

Among the blends of argon lines or dielectronic satellites with the calcium lines,

the most signiﬁcant is that of the Ar XVII w4 line (3.200 Å) which is blended with

Ca XVIII satellite q (as was noted in P78-1 spectra: Doschek & Feldman (1981)); for the

assumed Ar/Ca abundance ratio of 0.33, the lines are comparable in intensity over a wide

temperature range. The Ar XVI A5 satellite line feature is blended with Ca XVIII satellite

k, although it makes a less than ∼ 2% contribution to line k. Both Ca XVIII satellites q and

k have been extensively used as diagnostics of electron and ion temperature in SMM BCS

spectral analyses, so the blend of Ca XVIII satellite q and the Ar XVII w4 line should be

taken into account. The Ar XVI A6 feature is on the short-wavelength wing of the Ca XIX

w line; the presence of a line at this wavelength was noticed in some SMM BCS spectra but

was not then previously identiﬁed.

3.5. Continuum

The continuum, made up of free–free, free–bound, and two-photon radiation, was

calculated from chianti routines and added to the line spectra, although in the analysis of

the DIOGENESS spectra we compared only the line spectra as the DIOGENESS spectra

have a continuous background which is mostly instrumental in origin. The continuum

calculation used element abundances of Feldman (1992) and ion fractions from the chianti

ionization equilibrium. Typically, free-bound emission is comparable to free–free emission

over the 3.00 – 3.35 Å range, but two-photon emission is over two orders of magnitude

lower.

3.6. Synthetic Spectra Displayed

Figure 4 shows a color-coded representation of synthetic 3.00–3.30 Å spectra for

temperatures in the range 4 − 30 MK, with chief lines identiﬁed in the spectrum at the

top, calculated for 13.8 MK. In these spectra, the line proﬁle was taken to be Gaussian

with width equal to the thermal Doppler broadening (FWHM = 2.15 × 10−7 T

1/2
e Å for

for calcium spectra in this wavelength range) convolved with the DIOGENESS rocking

curve and a turbulent velocity of 100 km s−1 to take account of non-thermal broadening.

For the lower temperatures (nearest the bottom of the ﬁgure), the Ca XVI and Ca XV

satellites at longer wavelengths predominate, but rapidly fade with increasing temperature.

Correspondingly, the Ca XIX line intensities increase with temperature until ∼ 16 MK when

the ion fraction of He-like Ca maximizes. The principal Ca XVIII satellites q, r + a, k and

d13 + d15 are also prominent at lower temperatures; for the dielectronically formed lines,

their intensities decrease with an approximately T −1

e dependence relative to Ca XIX line w.

There is a similar decrease in the intensities of the Ca XVII satellites on the long-wavelength

side of Ca XIX line z, reﬂecting the decreasing proportion of the associated ion fractions

with temperature.

4. DIOGENESS AND THEORETICAL SPECTRA COMPARED

4.1. DIOGENESS Solar Flare Spectra

We compared the DIOGENESS spectra in Figure 2 with synthetic spectra calculated

for temperatures equal to the appropriate value of TGOES. In the spectrum with the lowest

temperature (TGOES = 12.8 MK), the low-temperature Ca XVII satellite lines are most

evident while the higher-temperature Ar XVII and Ar XVIII are weak or non-existent.

Fitting with theoretical spectra for this temperature should therefore best illustrate the

– 25 –

reliability of the Cowan calculations of the calcium satellites. Figure 5 (left panel) shows the

DIOGENESS spectrum with the best-ﬁt theoretical spectrum; the background “pedestal” in

the observed spectrum is ﬁtted with an arbitrary background in the theoretical spectrum,

and only the theoretical line spectrum without the continuum has been ﬁtted to those in

the observed spectrum. It is clear that the Ca XVII lines in the 3.21 – 3.24 Å, particularly

Ca XVII line β (3.2217Å), have intensities that are underestimated in the theoretical

spectrum, and the weak emission in the 3.24 – 3.25Å in the observed spectrum is not

matched by the Ca XVI line emission in the theoretical spectrum. The reduced χ2 for this

ﬁt is 0.79, and the residuals in the form log (O/C) (O = observed, C = calculated), which

are plotted beneath the spectrum, are larger for the wavelength range of the Ca XVII lines.

The Ca XVII line β is partly formed by inner-shell excitation from the Ca+16 ion, the

remaining Ca XVII line emission by dielectronic recombination of Ca+17 ions. Similarly,

the weak Ca XVI line emission is formed by dielectronic recombination of Ca+16 ions. At

a temperature of 12.8 MK, according to the chianti ionization equilibrium calculations

used here, the ion fractions of Ca+17 and Ca+16 are 0.13 and 0.02 respectively, decreasing

sharply with temperature. In a separate work in preparation, we examine the likelihood

of considerable errors in the ion fractions when small as a result of uncertainties in the

ionization and recombination rates. These are generally based on theory with very few

benchmark laboratory measurements. Bryans et al. (2006) in an extensive discussion of

ionization equilibria ﬁnds that the agreement of calculated and measured dielectronic

recombination rates is 35% or better, which is probably the typical agreement for other

ionization or recombination rates. Our work indicates that an uncertainty of as small

as 10% in these rates leads to uncertainties in some ion fractions that are considerable,

especially (as in the case of Ca+17 and Ca+16 at Te & 12.8 MK when the ion fractions are

very small. In view of this, it seemed to us quite possible that the Ca+16 and Ca+17 ion

fractions should be increased. The factors we used, equal to 1.3 and 2.0 respectively, were

– 26 –

assumed to apply for the whole temperature range of the DIOGENESS spectra considered

here (12.8 – 20.7 MK). This arbitrary assumption is not exact since it ignores the fact that

the Ca+18 ion fractions should be correspondingly adjusted, although since these fractions

are nearly unity (between 0.82 and 0.72), the amount is slight. It is found that, with these

adjusted ion fractions, the agreement between the DIOGENESS and theoretical spectra is

much improved, as is shown by the ﬁts to the Ca XVII lines in Figure 5 (right panel). In

addition, the weak emission at 3.24 – 3.25Å in the observed spectrum can now be identiﬁed

with the Ca XVI dielectronic lines. (Table 1 gives the two most intense lines.) We found,

however, that the reduced χ2 in this ﬁt (0.79) is almost identical to the ﬁt in Figure 5 (left

panel).

It is clear from Figure 5 that the Ar XVII lines make a substantial contribution (blue

line in ﬁgure). At 12.8 MK, only the Ar XVII w5 is prominent on the short-wavelength

side of the Ca XIX line w, where there is agreement of the theoretical spectrum with the

observed. The w4 line is not evident because of the blend with the Ca XVIII satellite q

(3.2005 Å), but its intensity calculated on the assumption of an Ar/Ca abundance of 0.33

is 25% of the total intensity of this blended feature. At wavelengths longer than Ca XIX

line z (3.211 Å), the Ar XVI satellites seen in Alcator C-Mod tokamak spectra, including

the A4 line feature, are visible, as are the Ca XVIII o and p satellites. This is the ﬁrst time

these lines as well as the Ca XVI satellites have been noted in astrophysical spectra.

With the adjustments in Ca XVII and Ca XVI ion fractions from the ﬁts at a

temperature of 12.8 MK, we ﬁtted the spectra for the remaining temperatures (13.4 MK,

14.8 MK, 16.8 MK, 20.7 MK), obtaining satisfactory ﬁts for the ﬁrst two with values of

reduced χ2 of 1.06 and 1.13. Figure 6 shows these four spectra, which have the same

color code as Figure 5. For the two higher temperatures, reduced χ2 was 1.97 and 3.33,

the slightly worse ﬁt apparently arising from the noisier background which may be due to

enhanced ﬂuorescence. At the higher temperatures, the argon lines are more prominent,

particularly the Ar XVIII Ly-β line at 3.151 Å, which are well ﬁtted so verifying the

chianti atomic data on which the line intensities are based. The measured wavelengths of

Rice et al. (2014) agree with the DIOGENESS wavelengths, which therefore validates the

DIOGENESS wavelength scale.

When narrower (3.17 – 3.25 Å) wavelength ranges are chosen, the slightly discrepant

intensities of the Ca XIX line y and to a smaller extent line x, in which the observed

intensities are greater than the theoretical, are more apparent (Figure 7). This has been

recognized in the past (e.g. Figure 5 of Bely-Dubau et al. (1982)) and also in ﬁts to the

equivalent Fe XXV lines (Lemen et al. 1984). High-n Ca XVIII satellites which converge

on to these lines could possibly account for this, but in the synthetic spectral program

this has been taken account of using the procedure of Bely-Dubau et al. (1979) in which

the total intensity of each satellite group is proportional to n−3 and the peak wavelength

is displaced from either x or y by an amount ∆λ which is proportional to n−3. We used

the Cowan calculations for the n = 6 satellites, calculated speciﬁcally, for the intensity

and ∆λ for satellites with n = 7 to n = 16, as in Bely-Dubau et al. (1979). However,

the amount of emission added was extremely small and did not account for the observed

discrepancy. Unless it can be attributed to the Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) calculated collision

strengths rather than more accurate close coupling data (see Section 3.2), the reason for the

discrepancy remains unknown. In Figure 7, the Ca XVII line group is displayed to better

advantage. Most of the satellite structure is accounted for by the present calculations, which

give similar results to those of Seely & Doschek (1989). At higher temperatures, Ca XVIII

satellite u becomes more prominent relative to the Ca XVII satellites, as is indicated in the

DIOGENESS spectrum for 20.7 MK.

– 31 –

4.2. Solar Flare Spectra from P78-1 SOLFLEX

The computer program generating synthetic spectra in the region of the Ca XIX X-ray

lines was written primarily to match the DIOGENESS spectra obtained in the large ﬂare

of 2001 August 25, but other spectra in which the Ca XIX lines and lower-ionization

satellites are visible can be examined with the same program. These include high-resolution

SOLFLEX spectra of the calcium lines from the P78-1 spacecraft discussed by Doschek et al.

(1979) and Seely & Doschek (1989). Four of these spectra were digitised and analyzed with

the synthetic spectrum program including the same adjustments to the Ca+16 and Ca+17

ion fractions as discussed in Section 4.1. Figure 8 shows examples of four spectra from three

large ﬂares, with temperatures estimated from the intensity ratio of Ca XVIII satellite k

to Ca XIX w. The line widths were broadened by a turbulent velocity of 60 km s−1 in all

cases. With these isothermal ﬁts, almost all the principal line features are reproduced in the

synthetic spectra, including the main lines within the Ca XVII line group at 3.21 – 3.24 Å,

given in Table 1. Argon lines are apparent, particularly the Ar XVIII Ly-β line at 3.151 Å

and the weak Ar XVI A6 satellite feature (3.170 Å) on the short-wavelength side of Ca XIX

line w. The intensities of these lines in the theoretical spectra are very similar to the

observed, so the Ar/Ca abundance ratio of 0.33 appears to apply to these spectra also.

However, the mismatch of the Ca XIX lines x and y, as in the DIOGENESS spectra, occurs

here, so indicating a problem in the calculation of the excitation of these lines and not the

observations.

4.3. Alcator C-Mod Tokamak Spectra

High-resolution spectra of the calcium lines discussed here were obtained from an

X-ray spectrometer viewing plasma produced in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. They have

been analyzed by Rice et al. (2014) and Rice et al. (2017). The measured electron density,

∼ 1014 cm−3, at the center of the plasma is about a factor of 100 higher than those

commonly measured in solar ﬂare plasmas but the ionization and excitation conditions are

similar. Two spectra shown in ﬁgures by Rice et al. (2014) were digitized and compared

with synthetic spectra using only the calcium line spectra without the argon lines; they are

shown in Figure 9. The top panel shows the spectrum viewed by the spectrometer through a

central chord; the central temperature of the plasma was measured to be 3.5 keV (41 MK),

much higher than any of the DIOGENESS or P78-1 SOLFLEX solar ﬂare spectra, though

the presence of Ca XVIII satellites q, r/a, and k and even Ca XVII lines at wavelengths

3.22 – 3.23 Å suggests that lower-temperature plasma is present also, presumably along the

line of sight of the spectrometer, either side of the plasma center. The observed line widths

appear to be smaller than the thermal Doppler broadened values, which may indicate that

the ion temperature is smaller than the electron temperature. A synthetic spectrum with

a temperature of 25 MK approximately matches the observed, but Ca XVII satellite q is

observed to be more intense than calculated, as are the Ca XVII satellites; this may be due

to the assumption of a single temperature whereas lower-temperature plasma is also being

viewed. In Figure 9 (lower panel), the spectrum was obtained by viewing the plasma at a

distance of 0.5 times the distance from the plasma center to its edge and therefore shows a

much lower temperature. We found an approximate ﬁt with the synthetic spectrum having

a temperature of 10.7 MK. The mismatches (e.g. in the Ca XVIII satellite q which is largely

formed by inner-shell excitation rather than dielectronic recombination) may arise from

lower-temperature plasma in the line of sight as in the higher-temperature spectrum.

5. RELATION OF Ca XIX AND GOES TEMPERATURES

spectra has shown that this is a good approximation for describing K XIX and Ar XVII

line emission including satellites (seen in RESIK channels 1 and 2) during ﬂare decays

(Sylwester et al. 2010b,a). An isothermal assumption was found to be less satisfactory

during rapidly rising phases of ﬂares. This agrees with an analysis of the late, nearly

isothermal, stages of long-duration ﬂares seen with the Yohkoh Bragg Crystal Spectrometer

(Phillips et al. 2005). However, RESIK ﬂare observations of the lower-temperature S XV,

S XVI, and Si XIV line emission indicated a less satisfactory ﬁt on an isothermal assumption

(Sylwester et al. 2013), and instead a diﬀerential emission measure procedure was used to

derive S and Si abundances (Sylwester et al. 2015a); TGOES was found to be near the higher

temperature range of the diﬀerential emission measure. A dependence on atomic number

is thus suggested, an isothermal assumption with temperature equal to TGOES adequately

describing helium-like Ar (Z = 18) and K (Z = 19) line spectra during ﬂare decays but

not spectra from helium-like Si (Z = 14), S (Z = 16), and lower-Z elements for which

lower-temperature plasma contributes to the line emission.

Here we examine the validity of an isothermal assumption for DIOGENESS Ca XIX

spectra during the 2001 August 25 ﬂare. We derived Te from the temperature of the best

ﬁt (TFIT) synthetic spectrum to each of sixty DIOGENESS spectra starting from scan 5

(see Figure 1, near the ﬂare maximum and the maximum of the Yohkoh HXT signal). The

values of TFIT are plotted (black points) in Figure 10 (left panel) against time (UT), with

corresponding values of TGOES (red line). The precision of the later values of TFIT is reduced

as the ﬂare spectra become less intense. A near-exact equality of the two temperatures is

observed (Figure 10, right panel), the color code indicating temperature as well as time,

with the higher temperatures measured at the earlier times. This is despite the fact that

the earliest times include some non-thermal emission, as shown by HXT, which does not

appear to aﬀect the emission in either of the GOES channels. The use of TGOES therefore

appears to be justiﬁed by this analysis, which is consistent with our earlier work on K XIX

– 36 –

and Ar XVII line emission observed by RESIK.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have here described X-ray spectra in the range of channels 1 and 4 of the

DIOGENESS spectrometer on CORONAS-F during a powerful (X5) ﬂare on 2001

August 25. The wavelength range, approximately 3.05 – 3.35 Å, includes prominent lines

of Ca XIX and associated dielectronic satellites and ionized argon (Ar XVII, Ar XVIII)

lines including Ar XVI dielectronic satellites. The spectra were divided into ﬁve groups

according to the value of TGOES, the temperature obtained from the emission ratio of the

two channels of GOES, which ranged from 12.8 MK to 20.7 MK. A computer program was

used to synthesize the line spectrum based on atomic data of Bely-Dubau et al. (1982) for

the Ca XIX lines, the Cowan Hartree–Fock code for the wavelengths and intensity factors

for dielectronic satellites of Ca XVIII, Ca XVII, and Ca XVI, atomic data for the Ar XVII

and Ar XVIII lines from chianti, and the Cowan code for associated dielectronic satellites.

Table 1 lists the more intense lines included in the synthetic spectral calculation which

included over 2000 lines. Comparison with the DIOGENESS spectra averaged over the

ﬁve temperature intervals shows good agreement for the Ca XIX and Ca XVIII satellites,

but the Ca XVII and weaker Ca XVI satellites were found to be more intense in the

DIOGENESS spectra. The argon lines were generally well ﬁtted by the synthetic spectra.

By increasing the Ca+17 and Ca+16 ion fractions by factors of 1.3 and 2.0 respectively,

much improved agreement was achieved. This adjustment of the ion fractions is justiﬁed

by the fact that the Ca+17 and Ca+16 ion fractions are small at all relevant temperatures,

and a roughly 10% uncertainty in ionization and recombination rates would easily explain

such increases. Comparison of synthetic spectra with those from the P78-1 SOLFLEX

instrument (Figure 8) shows good agreement, although comparison with the calcium spectra

produced in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak are slightly less satisfactory, the explanation

probably being the multi-thermal and non-equilibrium or non-stationary nature of the

plasma.

From the synthetic spectra, we ﬁnd that the overlap of ionized calcium and argon

lines in the spectral range of interest is important in at least one case, the blend of the

Ca XVIII satellite q (3.2005 AA), commonly used to diagnose the non-equilibrium state

of ﬂare plasmas (Bely-Dubau et al. 1982), with the Ar XVII w4 line (3.1997 Å), as was

pointed out by Doschek & Feldman (1981). With an assumed Ar/Ca ratio of 0.33 (based

on measurements by Sylwester et al. (1998) and Sylwester et al. (2010a)), the contribution

made by the Ar XVII line is comparable to the q line. As pointed out by Sylwester et al.

(1998), the calcium abundance varies from ﬂare to ﬂare, so the blend may be more or

less serious according as the calcium abundance is less or more; an extreme case has been

pointed out by Doschek & Warren (2016) who ﬁnd from ultraviolet line emission near a

sunspot that the Ar/Ca abundance ratio may be more than photospheric, equal to around

1.4. On the other hand, a large enhancement of the calcium abundance might occur in

ﬂares on active dwarf M stars, if the FIP eﬀect is larger than that apparently operating

in the solar atmosphere; thus, the Ar/Ca abundance ratio may be less than our assumed

value, reducing the eﬀect of argon line blends. It should be noted also that line blends

occur in other X-ray spectral regions, e.g. with the S XV w6 line (3.998 Å) very near the

Ar XVII lines at 3.969 – 3.994 Å. These may be relevant to observations of stellar coronae

taken with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer.

Weaker Ar XVI satellites in DIOGENESS spectra make small contributions, e.g. the

A5 feature (3.2058 Å) makes a few percent contribution to Ca XVIII line k (3.2066 Å), and

the A6 feature (3.1704 Å) may appear on the short-wavelength side of the Ca XIX line w

(3.1774 AA). With the very high sensitivity and spectral resolution of DIOGENESS, the

– 39 –

weak Ar XVI satellite features A6 and A4 (3.273 Å) and the Ca XVIII p and o satellites

(3.2636 Å, 3.2688 Å) are evident, particularly in the spectrum with TGOES = 16.8 MK.

These lines have not been recorded in solar ﬂare spectra before.

We have also examined the assumption of isothermal plasma to describe the

DIOGENESS spectra, plotting the temperature (TFIT) of the best-ﬁt synthetic spectrum

to each DIOGENESS spectrum from scan 5 to the end of the observations against TGOES,

ﬁnding an almost exact equality. An isothermal description of Ca XIX emission is therefore

valid, with the temperature given by TGOES.

Although solar ﬂare X-ray spectra in the region of the Ca XIX lines have not recently

been observed, analysis of the extensive archive of SMM BCS spectra is now possible

with application of the synthetic spectral code described here. In particular, it will be

possible to re-analyze spectra used to derive the ﬂare calcium abundance and deduce more

exactly the relation of the variability of this abundance with ﬂare type; this analysis is now

proceeding. Future spacecraft instrumentation – the ChemiX spectrometer, due for launch

on Interhelioprobe in 2025 or 2026 – will beneﬁt from the synthetic spectral procedure

described here.
