ABSTRACT

Context. Various solar features can be seen in emission or absorption on maps of the Sun in the millimeter and submillimeter wave-
length range. The recently installed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is capable of observing the Sun in that
wavelength range with an unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. To interpret solar observations with ALMA the
ﬁrst important step is to compare solar ALMA maps with simultaneous images of the Sun recorded in other spectral ranges.
Aims. The ﬁrst aim of the present work is to identify diﬀerent structures in the solar atmosphere seen in the optical, infrared and EUV
parts of the spectrum (quiet Sun, active regions, prominences on the disc, magnetic inversion lines, coronal holes and coronal bright
points) in a full disc solar ALMA image. The second aim is to measure the intensities (brightness temperatures) of those structures
and to compare them with the corresponding quiet Sun level.
Methods. A full disc solar image at 1.21 mm obtained on December 18, 2015 during a CSV-EOC campaign with ALMA is calibrated
and compared with full disc solar images from the same day in Hα line, in He I 1083 nm line core, and with various SDO images
(AIA at 170 nm, 30.4 nm, 21.1 nm, 19.3 nm, and 17.1 nm and HMI magnetogram). The brightness temperatures of various structures
are determined by averaging over corresponding regions of interest in the calibrated ALMA image.
Results. Positions of the quiet Sun, active regions, prominences on the disc, magnetic inversion lines, coronal holes and coronal bright
points are identiﬁed in the ALMA image. At the wavelength of 1.21 mm active regions appear as bright areas (but sunspots are dark),
while prominences on the disc and coronal holes are not discernible from the quiet Sun background, although having slightly less
intensity than surrounding quiet Sun regions. Magnetic inversion lines appear as large, elongated dark structures and coronal bright
points correspond to ALMA bright points.
Conclusions. These observational results are in general agreement with sparse earlier measurements at similar wavelengths. The
identiﬁcation of coronal bright points represents the most important new result. By comparing ALMA and other maps, it was found
that the ALMA image was oriented properly and that the procedure of overlaying the ALMA image with other images is accurate at
the 5 arc sec level. The potential of ALMA for physics of the solar chromosphere is emphasized.

1. Introduction

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)1
2 is currently the world largest ground based astronomical facil-
ity, capable of observing almost all types of celestial objects in-
cluding the Sun. The main advantage of solar observations with
ALMA is mapping of the solar chromosphere with an unprece-

dented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution in the wave-
length range between 0.3 mm and 8.6 mm. Solar measurements
are currently limited to two observing bands at 1.3 mm and 3
mm.

An important characteristic of ALMA is its capability to
be used as an approximately linear thermometer of the gas in
the solar atmosphere (Wedemeyer et al. 2016). So, the mea-
sured brightness temperature is directly proportional to the gas
temperature of the observed structure or layer in the solar at-
mosphere. Therefore, it is very important to develop numerical

simulations of various solar atmosphere types as a priori and a
posteriori supporting tools for solar observations with ALMA
(Wedemeyer et al. 2015) and to compare results with available
measurements. It was clear from the initial phase that ALMA
can be pointed at the Sun and that it will become an important
tool if it could be made available for solar physics. Various ap-
plications were described by Bastian (2002), Wedemeyer-Böhm
et al. (2007), Loukitcheva et al. (2008), Karlický et al. (2011),
and Loukitcheva et al. (2015). An extensive review of solar sci-
entiﬁc topics to be addressed with ALMA, including quiet Sun,
active regions and prominences, was prepared by Wedemeyer
et al. (2016).

We brieﬂy describe some of the earlier solar measurements
in the ALMA wavelength range (from λ = 0.3 mm to λ = 10
mm). Brightness temperature measurements of the quiet Sun
were reviewed and compared with results of theoretical mod-
els by Gary (1996), by Loukitcheva et al. (2004, 2015), and by
Benz (2009). Further, the quiet Sun emission in the wavelength
range from λ = 0.85 mm to λ = 8 mm was measured by Bas-
tian et al. (1993b), White et al. (2006), Brajša et al. (2007a,b),
and Iwai et al. (2017). In the wavelength range 0.7 mm to 5 mm
various measurements give the quiet Sun brightness temperature
in the range from 5000 K to 8000 K, as summarized by White
et al. (2017). In spite of scattered results and measurement uncer-
tainties, there is an average trend of the brightness temperature
increase with wavelength, as expected.

Solar active regions were observed in the wavelength range
from λ = 0.35 mm to λ = 9.5 mm by Kundu & McCullough
(1972), Pohjolainen et al. (1991), Bastian et al. (1993b), Lind-
sey & Kopp (1995), Silva et al. (2005), White et al. (2006), Iwai
& Shimojo (2015), Iwai et al. (2016), and Kallunki & Uunila
(2017). As expected, active regions at mm and sub-mm wave-
lengths generally appear as bright areas, although sunspot um-
brae, if resolved, have lower brightness temperatures than the
quiet Sun level at λ ≤ 3.5 mm (Lindsey & Kopp 1995; Louk-
itcheva et al. 2014; Iwai & Shimojo 2015) or have almost equal
brightness temperature as the quiet Sun at λ = 8.8 mm (Iwai
et al. 2016).

Solar prominences, observed as ﬁlaments on the disc, are
generally seen as structures of lower brightness temperature than
the quiet Sun at mm wavelengths. Such results were obtained
by measurements in the wavelength range from λ = 4 mm to
λ = 8 mm (Kundu et al. 1978; Schmahl et al. 1981; Vršnak et al.
1992). According to the list of radio observations of ﬁlaments
compiled and corrected by Raoult et al. (1979), the intensity con-
trast (lower brightness temperatures of ﬁlaments) with respect to
the quiet Sun decreases with frequency, being ≈5% at 3.5 mm.
Hiei et al. (1986) performed measurements of ﬁlaments on the
disc at λ = 8.3 mm and at λ = 3.1 mm and further improved
results of Raoult et al. (1979) taking into account observational
beam/convolution eﬀects. In this way larger brightness tempera-
ture diﬀerences between ﬁlaments and quiet Sun were measured.
At higher frequencies, Bastian et al. (1993a) found negligible
contrast (but still a lower brightness temperature than the quiet
Sun level) at and near the location of Hα ﬁlaments at λ = 0.85
mm.

At mm wavelengths coronal holes are mostly observed as
regions having brightness temperatures slightly below the quiet
Sun level, but local enhancements of radiation within their bor-
ders can also be seen. Measurements which support this general
result were performed in the wavelength range from λ = 3.0
mm to λ = 8.8 mm by Kundu & Liu (1976), Kosugi et al.
(1986), Pohjolainen & Urpo (1997), Gopalswamy et al. (1999),
Pohjolainen et al. (2000), White et al. (2006), and Brajša et al.

(2007a,b). Moreover, local enhancements of radio emission in
polar regions were measured by Urpo & Pohjolainen (1987),
Riehokainen et al. (1998), and Pohjolainen (2000) in the wave-
length range from λ = 3.5 mm to λ = 8 mm.

As we have seen, there is a relatively large number of previ-
ous solar studies at mm and to a lesser extent at sub-mm wave-
lengths. However, the main problem/deﬁciency of these works
are too low spatial resolution and poor calibration. With ALMA
it is now possible to substantially improve observations of the
Sun at mm and sub-mm wavelengths.

Thermal bremsstrahlung can be considered as the dominant
radiation mechanism of the quiet solar radio emission at mm
and sub-mm wavelengths (e.g. Tapping & Harvey 1994; Bas-
tian 1995; Benz et al. 1997). A strong magnetic ﬁeld would be
necessary (in the range 3300 Gauss − 6600 Gauss, for λ = 8 mm
and 28000 Gauss and more for λ = 1.21 mm), for thermal gy-
romagnetic (cyclotron) radiation (e.g. Brajša et al. 2009). Such a
large magnetic ﬁeld needed for the short-mm wavelength gyro-
magnetic emission is highly improbable.

Calculations of the brightness temperatures of the quiet Sun
and chromospheric network (e.g. Chiuderi Drago et al. 1983;
Loukitcheva et al. 2004, 2006) are usually based on the VAL
(Vernazza et al. 1981), FAL (Fontenla et al. 1993), and CS
(Carlsson & Stein 1992, 1995, 1997, 2002) models. Modeling of
ﬁlaments radio emission (or absorption) is not straightforward,
since the results are strongly frequency dependent, especially in
the mm and sub-mm wavelength range (Chiuderi Drago 1990;
Chiuderi & Chiuderi Drago 1991; Chuideri Drago et al. 1992;
Engvold 1994; Tandberg-Hanssen 1995). Moreover, many sub-
tle eﬀects should be taken into account, e.g., the inﬂuence of the
prominence-corona transition region, or the visibility of ﬁlament
channels and coronal condensations. Coronal condensations are
structures lying over magnetic inversion lines which could be
discernible at mm wavelengths, but remain invisible in the Hα
ﬁltergrams (Kundu et al. 1978; Vršnak et al. 1992).

Our analysis is divided in two parts: the observational part
(present work, Paper I) and the modeling part (subsequent pa-
per, Paper II). In present paper we ﬁrst describe measurements
and methods of data reduction (Sect. 2), then present the results
of the observational analysis of the ALMA image and compare
them with other data (Sect. 3) and ﬁnally discuss the most im-
portant results and summarize conclusions (Sect. 4).

2. Measurements and data reduction

In the period 2011 – 2015 Commissioning and Science Veri-
ﬁcation (CSV) phase of solar observations with ALMA took
place (Bastian et al. 2015; Kobelski & ALMA Solar Develop-
ment Team 2016). In this frame several solar campaigns were
performed, lasting typically between one day and one week. Test
observational material, both single dish and interferometric, was
collected and analyzed from which solar images were compiled.
A ﬁrst part of the CSV data was recently released to the scientiﬁc
community3.

An image of the whole solar disc from the December 2015
CSV campaign is used in current analysis. In Fig. 1 we present
the December 18th, 2015 ALMA image taken with a single dish
antenna together with the Cerro Tololo4 Hα and several SDO5
full-disc solar images obtained at the same time. Besides the
SDO/AIA composite image, the SDO/AIA 170 nm ﬁltergram,

the SDO/AIA 30.4 nm ﬁltergram and the SDO/HMI magne-
togram are presented.

The full disc solar map was obtained by scanning the solar
disc with a 12 m single dish total power ALMA antenna (PM03)
at a frequency of 248 GHz corresponding to λ = 1.21 mm in
a double circle pattern (Phillips et al. 2015). The measurement
frequency/wavelength belongs to Band 6, which is one of the ten
ALMA observing bands. We restricted our analysis to Band 6,
because on December 18th, 2015 no full disc image in the other
observing band (Band 3) was available. The observing day De-
cember 18, 2015 was chosen because of availability of images
in other wavelength ranges, especially He I 1083 nm, which was
not accessible for the other observing days. The measurement
started at 20:12:21 UT on December 18, 2015 and lasted for
about 13 minutes. The beam size amounts to 26 arcsec.

A two-load method was used to calibrate the data where
measurements of the known ambient and hot load are used to
determine the source brightness temperature, together with mea-
surements of zero reference and received power on and oﬀ the
source. Also, a correction (multiplication) factor C was applied
to account for the antenna eﬃciency: C = 1.16 for Band 6
(White et al. 2017). Data reduction was performed using the
Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package6.
The ﬁnal uncertainty in the brightness temperature is about 5 %
(White et al. 2017).

More information about the measurements, calibration and
imaging of the solar observations with ALMA for the single
dish/total power mode can be found in the paper by White et al.
(2017).

In present work we compare the full disc solar image at 1.21
mm obtained on December 18, 2015 with ALMA with full disc
solar images from the same day in Hα line (Cerro Tololo Ob-
servatory, NISP), in He I 1083 nm line core (NSO SOLIS)7, and
with various SDO images (a composite AIA image at 30.4 nm,
21.1 nm, and 17.1 nm; AIA ﬁltergrams at 170 nm, at 30.4 nm,
and at 19.3 nm; and a HMI magnetogram).

3. An analysis of the ALMA image and comparison

with other data

A comparison of full-disc solar images taken at diﬀerent wave-
lengths (Fig. 1) reveals many interesting characteristics. Active
regions, which appear bright in Hα and in EUV, appear also
bright at 1.21 mm. Filaments on the disc, clearly seen in Hα can
not easily be identiﬁed at 1.21 mm; their brightness temperature
is obviously rather close to the quiet Sun background. Finally,
coronal holes which are identiﬁed as dark regions in EUV have
no visible counterparts at 1.21 mm (no signiﬁcant change of the
brightness temperature compared to the quiet Sun background).
In the solar ALMA image (Fig. 1a) several regions of inter-
est are indicated. The brightness temperature levels, measured
for these regions of interest, are presented in Table 1. Brightness
temperatures of various structures are calculated as the mean val-
ues of all pixels within regions of interest denoted in Fig. 1a. The
quiet Sun levels are determined from circles centered at various
distances, r, from the solar disc center. At the solar disc center
radius of the circle is 5 pixels, while for all other quiet Sun mea-
surements it is 30 pixels. The size of a pixel is about 3 arc sec.
The coronal hole level is measured within the circle of a radius
of 30 pixels located within the CH1. The contours of active re-
gion are deﬁned using a numerical criterion: all pixels having

7 https://solis.nso.edu/0/index.html

Article number, page 4 of 9

brightness temperature Tb > 6900 K in the area of the AR1 are
included in the region of interest. With this criterion the bright
area associated with active region is included in the region of
interest and sunspots are automatically excluded from the ac-
tive region area. The sunspot is also deﬁned with the numerical
criterion: all pixels with Tb < 6400 K at the position denoted
with SS. We note that this selection criteria (for AR1 and SS)
are crude and to some extent arbitrary. The level of magnetic
inversion line is deﬁned as the mean value within the rectangle
within the inversion line area (IL), while the prominence level
was taken from the shape of the Hα image put over. The number
of pixels used in the averaging process depends on the size of a
structure and varies from n = 78 in the central quiet Sun region
to n = 3048 in the active region.

To quantitatively measure the brightness temperature of the
above mentioned structures the center-to-limb function should
be taken into account. As we can see from Table 1, there is a
clear limb brightening at 1.21 mm (compare the brightness tem-
peratures of the quiet Sun at diﬀerent radial distances from the
solar disc center). The brightness temperature values of various
solar structures are compared with the quiet Sun levels measured
at the same radial distances from the solar disc center as the re-
spective structures but along the solar equator in the east direc-
tion (Table 1). Finally, the relative brightness temperatures are
given in Table 1: a positive (negative) sign indicates that the fea-
ture is brighter (darker) than the surroundings.

3.1. Quiet Sun

It is not easy to deﬁne and observationally identify the quiet
Sun regions at mm wavelengths because of highly complex ﬁne
structure chromosphere seen (Fig. 1a). However, we have cho-
sen 6 regions of interest representing the quiet Sun areas at dif-
ferent radial distances from the solar disc center, see Table 1.
The quiet Sun brightness temperature increases steadily with in-
creasing radial distance from the disc center consistent with a
pronounced limb brightening. The amount of this limb brighten-
ing is in the order of 10 % in agreement with recent results of
Alissandrakis et al. (2017). The central brightness temperature
of the quiet Sun is measured as the average value of all intensi-
ties within the small circle located at the center of the solar disc
in Fig. 1a. This value is 6040 K (Table 1) fully consistent with
the central quiet Sun brightness temperature measured at 1.21
mm for the December 2015 data (White et al. 2017).

3.2. Active regions and sunspots

Active regions are clearly bright at the wavelength of 1.21 mm
(Fig. 1a). They are also bright in other images of the solar chro-
mosphere and corona: SDO AIA composite image (Fig. 1b), Hα
(Fig. 1c), SDO AIA 170 nm (Fig. 1d), and SDO AIA He I 30.4
nm (Fig. 1e). As it is well known they lie over strong magnetic
ﬁeld regions in the solar photosphere (Fig. 1f). We now ana-
lyze in more detail the most prominent active region, denoted as
AR1 in Fig. 1. This active region (AR1) has an average magnetic
ﬁeld strength of about 1000 Gauss (as measured in the magne-
togram, Fig. 1f) and the average measured brightness tempera-
ture (Fig. 1a) is given in Table 1. In deﬁning the contours of the
AR1 the sunspots are excluded, because the sunspot umbras have
a lower brightness temperature then the rest of the AR. When
compared with the average brightness temperature of a quiet Sun
region at the corresponding radial distance from the disc center

Notes. Structures refer to the regions of interest denoted in Fig. 1a: central quiet Sun (QS), sunspot (SS), active region (AR1), magnetic inversion
line (IL), prominence on the disc (PR/FIL1) and coronal hole (CH1). The mean values of brightness temperature of these structures, given here
together with their corresponding standard deviations, are compared with the ones of the quiet Sun regions at the same radial distances from the
center of the solar disc, r. The averaging was performed within selected regions of interest and the number of pixels within is denoted by n.

(Table 1), the AR1 has an average surplus emission of more than
1000 K.

ALMA structures are cospatial with dark structures visible in He
30.4 ﬁltergram (Fig. 1e).

Although active regions are bright at 1.21 mm, sunspots are
clearly dark, especially when compared with active region envi-
ronment (Fig. 1). We measured the average brightness tempera-
ture of the large sunspot in AR1 (Fig. 1a) and its intensity (6080
K) is lower not only than the intensity of the surrounding ac-
tive region, but also than the average brightness temperature of
the quiet Sun at the corresponding radial distance from the so-
lar disc center (Table 1). Finally we note that the large sunspot
SS (Fig. 1a) clearly corresponds to the area of a strong magnetic
ﬁeld (Fig. 1f) in the order of 1500 - 2500 Gauss.

3.3. Prominences on the solar disc

On the ALMA observing day, December 18, 2015, several
prominences on the solar disc were observed. They can be iden-
tiﬁed as dark ﬁlaments seen in the Hα ﬁltergram presented in
Fig. 1c. We now search for their counterparts in the ALMA map
(Fig. 1a) and ﬁnd that no distinctive structures are present at the
places of Hα ﬁlaments in the 1.21 mm map. To quantitatively an-
alyze the radiation intensity of ﬁlaments on the disc the bright-
ness temperature of a part of the ALMA map (Fig. 1a) at the
position of the ﬁlament FIL1 (Fig. 1c) was measured. The result
is presented in Table 1 together with the brightness temperature
of a quiet Sun regions measured at the same radial distance from
the solar disc center as the FIL1. At the wavelength of 1.21 mm
the prominence on the disc has a brightness temperature lower
than the quiet Sun level by slightly more than 100 K. The reli-
ability of this result depends on the overlying precision (in the
order of 5 arc sec) and the deviations from the measured mean
intensity value (Table 1).

3.4. Magnetic inversion lines

We now turn to the following question: In the 1.21 mm map,
what are the dark, large, elongated structures lying between ac-
tive regions (Fig. 1a)? By comparison with the SDO HMI mag-
netogram (Fig. 1f), it can be seen that all of these ALMA struc-
tures are cospatial with the inversion lines of the large scale mag-
netic ﬁeld on the Sun. For a quantitative analysis a part of the
magnetic inversion line was chosen (Fig. 1a) and its brightness
temperature was measured and compared with the corresponding
quiet Sun region (Table 1). The net deﬁcit of brightness temper-
ature of the measured portion of the magnetic inversion line is
− 170 K. Finally, it is also noteworthy that all these large dark

3.5. Coronal holes

Coronal holes can be most easily identiﬁed in the EUV images
of the Sun (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a). On the observing day, December
15, 2015, two large coronal holes were present on the Sun, de-
noted by CH1 and CH2. By comparing the EUV images with the
ALMA map (Fig. 1a) it is easily seen that coronal holes have no
distinctive counterparts at 1.21 mm. Indeed, the average bright-
ness temperature measured for a region of interest within the
coronal hole CH1 (Fig. 1a) is only 50 K below the adjacent quiet
Sun region identiﬁed at the same radial distance from the so-
lar disc center (Table 1). The CH1 is the most prominent solar
coronal hole on the observing day, so only it was measured as a
representative example.

3.6. Coronal bright points

Coronal bright points are small bright structures belonging to the
low corona which can be clearly identiﬁed in X-ray and EUV
images of the Sun. These structures have dimensions in the or-
der of 15 - 30 arc sec and are closely related to the underlying
small-scale magnetic elements and He I 1083 nm dark points
(Harvey-Angle 1993; Brajša et al. 2002). Their visual classiﬁca-
tion put them into one of the three classes: point-like structures,
small loops and small active regions (Brajša et al. 2002). Several
dozens of identiﬁed coronal bright points can be seen in Fig. 1 in
the paper by Sudar et al. (2015). Coronal bright points are most
easily observed outside active regions.

A solar ﬁltergram recorded with SDO/AIA at 19.3 nm is pre-
sented in Fig. 2a and 56 coronal bright points (only point-like
structures and small loops) are identiﬁed and denoted with blue
boxes. In Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c the He I 1083 nm ﬁltergram and the
ALMA 1.21 mm map are presented, respectively, with the above
mentioned 56 blue boxes placed in the same positions as in the
SDO/AIA image in Fig. 2a. By a careful and detailed compari-
son of the three images we can conclude: (i) the great majority
(75 %) of all coronal bright points from the EUV image cor-
responds to He I 1083 nm dark points, (ii) the great majority
(82 %) of all coronal bright points from the EUV image corre-
sponds to the ALMA 1.21 mm bright points, and (iii) the shape
and orientation of the structures is preserved and reproduced in
all three spectral ranges. These inferences have two important
implications: (a) coronal bright points have almost a one to one
correspondence with the ALMA 1.21 mm bright points and (b)

this is an important and conclusive proof that the precision of
ALMA can be best tested with coronal bright points and this
spatial precision is in the order of 5 arc sec.

Finally, to investigate in more detail coronal bright points,
which we can now also call ALMA bright points, we present a
zoomed in portion of the ALMA image together with a corre-
sponding magnetogram in Fig. 3. By comparing these two im-

ages following important conclusion can be made: (i) ALMA
bright points are clearly related to small-scale bipolar magnetic
regions (also one polarity is prevailing in some cases) and (ii)
following the shape of magnetic ﬁne structure the pattern is pre-
served and reproduced in the ALMA image: small bright struc-
tures identiﬁed in the ALMA image (Fig. 3a) are co-spatial with
small-scale magnetic features (Fig. 3b) and the mm brightness is

clearly proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength (for places on

4. Summary, discussion and conclusions

We now summarize observational results for the solar objects an-
alyzed in previous Sect., compare them with other existing stud-
ies and list the most important conclusions of the present study.
Quiet Sun. The deﬁnition and identiﬁcation of the quiet Sun
regions and the determination of the brightness temperature of
the quiet Sun level is not easy, which is primarily due to the
highly complex ﬁne structure of the solar chromosphere (Wede-
meyer et al. 2016) and a frequency dependent center to limb

intensity function with a pronounced limb brightening at mm
wavelengths (Bastian et al. 1993b; Brajša et al. 1994; White et al.
2017; Alissandrakis et al. 2017). In present analysis we have de-
termined the brightness temperature of the quiet Sun region at
the disc center to be 6040 K at 1.21 mm, which is fully consis-
tent with the central brightness temperature determined by White
et al. (2017) for the 2015 data (6040 ± 250 K). Also the estimated
limb brightening at 1.21 mm is up to 10 %, consistent with the
results of Alissandrakis et al. (2017).

Active regions and sunspots. At the wavelength of 1.21 mm
active regions are clearly bright, as expected and in accordance
with all previous studies for the mm wavelength range. The
strong excess emission measured in this work amounts to more

A&A proofs: manuscript no. alma_csv_obs_v1

than 1000 K for the analyzed active region. However, sunspots
are seen in absorption, as localized dark areas, in agreement with
some earlier studies for the wavelengths λ ≤ 3.5 mm (Lindsey &
Kopp 1995; Loukitcheva et al. 2014; Iwai & Shimojo 2015). As
present analysis shows, the analyzed sunspot has brightness tem-
perature lower by 90 K than a quiet Sun region at the same radial
distance from the solar disc center allowing us to conclude that
sunspots are darker not only in comparison with ambient active
regions, but also to the quiet Sun regions.

Prominences on the solar disc. As we have seen, promi-
nences on the solar disc can not be easily identiﬁed against the
surrounding quiet Sun background. However, the quantitative
analysis reveals that prominences have brightness temperatures
lower in the order of 100 K than the quiet Sun regions at the
same radial distances from the disc center at the observing wave-
length of 1.21 mm. This is in agreement with a previous study
(Bastian et al. 1993a) in which a negligible contrast, but still a
lower brightness temperature than the quiet Sun level, was mea-
sured for prominences on solar disc at the wavelength near 1
mm. The appearance (emission vs. absorption) of prominences
on the solar disc at mm and sub-mm wavelengths is rather fre-
quency dependent and further multifrequency ALMA observa-
tions are needed to bring more insight into this interesting topic.
Magnetic inversion lines. In the ALMA map taken at 1.21
mm the inversion lines of the large scale magnetic ﬁeld on the
Sun are clearly visible as large elongated dark structures. The
average brightness temperature of the measured part of the in-
version line has a brightness temperature 170 K below the quiet
Sun level. This is in agreement with earlier studies performed at
mm wavelengths. Brajša et al. (1992) and Vršnak et al. (1992)
performed an extensive statistical analysis of full disc solar maps
at the wavelength of 8 mm and concluded that 99% of all dark
structures lie over the inversion lines of the large scale magnetic
ﬁeld. Bastian et al. (1993a) analyzed full disc solar maps at the
wavelength near 1 mm and also found a lower brightness tem-
perature at the places of magnetic inversion lines. A clear associ-
ation between large scale dark structures and magnetic inversion
lines can also be found in the recently published solar ALMA
maps (White et al. 2017). This observationally found correlation
between regions of lower brightness temperature at mm wave-
lengths and magnetic inversion lines can be interpreted in terms
of reduced heating and a smaller density scale height in the chro-
mosphere along the inversion lines of the large scale magnetic
ﬁeld where the magnetic ﬁeld vector is horizontal (Vršnak et al.
1992; Bastian et al. 1993a; Brajša 1993).

Coronal holes. Similarly as prominences on the disc, coro-
nal holes have no discernible contrasts against the quiet Sun
background at the observing wavelength of 1.21 mm. The net in-
tensity depression measured in present work is only 50 K. This is
in general agreement with previous studies mentioned in Sect. 1,
but there is an obvious lack of other coronal holes observations
at the wavelength around 1 mm. So, further multifrequency ob-
servations with ALMA are desirable, taking into account that
coronal contribution, which is dominantly responsible for the ra-
diation of coronal holes, is becoming less and less important for
shorter wavelengths.

Coronal bright points. In this work we presented clear ob-
servational evidence that the great majority of all coronal bright
points from the EUV image corresponds to the He I 1083 nm
dark points (75 %) and to the ALMA 1.21 mm bright points
(82 %). Moreover, all ALMA 1.21 mm bright points show well-
deﬁned relationship with magnetic structures (100 % correspon-
dence), mostly with small scale bipolar magnetic regions and in
some cases with small unipolar magnetic regions. A correlation

in position of up to 50% between 20 cm bright points and coro-
nal bright points was found by Habbal & Harvey (1988) and by
Nitta et al. (1992). A similar result for the wavelength of 17.6
mm was reported by Kundu et al. (1994).These results are very
interesting, but we note that the observing wavelength of 20 cm
is two orders of magnitude and the observing wavelength of 17.6
mm is one order of magnitude larger than the one used here (1.21
mm). It is also important to note that the 20 cm emission comes
from the solar corona and the 1.21 mm radiation originates in the
solar chromosphere: these are two diﬀerent layers in the solar
atmosphere having rather diﬀerent temperatures. An attempt to
identify a coronal bright point in a 8 mm solar map failed due to
the poor spatial resolution (Brajša et al. 2007b). Coronal bright
points are magnetic structures associated with bipolar magnetic
elements: ephemeral (emerging) regions or cancelling magnetic
features (Brajša et al. 2004; Sudar et al. 2015). Best identiﬁca-
tion of coronal bright points is in EUV images of the Sun (e.g.
with the SDO) and, when the spatial resolution permits, it can be
seen that they consist of small loops in almost all cases. The ob-
served higher brightness temperatures of coronal bright points
in the ALMA map at 1.21 mm is due to the locally increased
temperature and density in these loops.

In present work we analyzed a full disc solar ALMA map
and performed a detailed comparison of this map with solar
images obtained in other relevant wavelength ranges. The de-
tectability of various solar features was checked in both direc-
tions (an identiﬁcation of solar structures known at other wave-
lengths in the ALMA image and an identiﬁcation of prominent
ALMA structures in images at other wavelengths). It was found
that the ALMA image was oriented correctly and that the proce-
dure of overlay and co-align the ALMA image with other images
was performed properly. In subsequent papers we compare the
observational results from this paper with the theoretical models
(Paper II) and later investigate chromospheric ﬁne structure in
more detail using ALMA interferometric measurements.
