We consider here one-parameter semigroups T = (T (t))t>0 of bounded
operators on a Banach space X which are weakly continuous in the sense of
Arveson. For such a semigroup T denote by MωT the convolution algebra
+∞
kT (t)kd|µ|(t) <
consisting in those measures µ on (0, +∞) such that R
0
+∞. The Pettis integral R +∞
T (t)dµ(t) deﬁnes for µ ∈ MωT a bounded
operator φT(µ) on X. Identifying the space L1
ωT of (classes of) measur-
able functions f satisfying R +∞
|f (t)kT (t)kdt < +∞ to a closed subspace
MωT in the usual way, we deﬁne the Arveson ideal IT of the semigroup
to be the closure in B(X) of φT(L1
ωT ). Using a variant of a procedure
introduced a long time ago by the author we introduce a dense ideal UT
of IT, which is a Banach algebra with respect to a suitable norm k.kUT ,
such that lim supt→0+ kT (t)kB(UT) < +∞. The normalized Arveson ideal
JT is the closure of IT in B(UT). The Banach algebra JT has a sequen-
tial approximate identity and is isometrically isomorphic to a closed ideal
of its multiplier algebra M(JT). The Banach algebras UT, IT and JT
are "similar", and the map Su/v → Sau/av deﬁnes when a generates a
dense principal ideal of UT a pseudobounded isomorphism from the alge-
bre QM(JT) of quasimultipliers on JT onto the quasimultipliers algebras
QM(UT) and QM(IT).

We deﬁne the generator AT of the semigroup T to be a quasimul-
tiplier on IT, or ,equivalently, on JT. Every character χ on IT has an
extension ˜χ to QM(IT). Let Resar(AT) be the complement of the set
{ ˜χ(AT)}χ∈
IT . The quasimultiplier A − µI has an inverse belonging to
d
JT for µ ∈ Resar(AT), which allows to consider this inverse as a "regu-
lar" quasimultiplier on the Arveson ideal IT. The usual resolvent formula
holds in this context for Re(µ) > limt→+∞

Set Π+

α := {z ∈ C | Re(z) > α}. We revisit the functional cal-
culus associated to the generator AT by deﬁning F (−AT) ∈ JT by a
Cauchy integral when F belongs to the Hardy space H 1(Π+
α ) for some
α < − limt→+∞
. We then deﬁne F (−AT) as a quasimultiplier on
JT and IT when F belongs to the Smirnov class on Π+
α , and F (−AT)
is a regular quasimultiplier on JT and IT if F is bounded on Π+
α . If
F (z) = e−zt for some t > 0, then F (−AT) = T (t), and if F (z) = −z, we
indeed have F (−AT) = AT.

1 Introduction

We study here the generator of a semigroup T = (T (t))t>0 of bounded operators
on a Banach space X which is weakly continuous with respect to a dual pair
(X, X∗) satisfying the conditions introduced by Arveson in 1974 in his sem-
inal paper [2] on group representations. Semigroups satisfying some weaker
properties have been considered in 1953 by Feller, who studied semigroups
T = (T (t))t>0 of bounded operators on a Banach space X such there exists
a nonzero continuous linear form l on X for which the map t →< T (t)x, l > is
measurable for every x ∈ X, and his work involves the subspace X∗ of the dual
space X ′ generated by the family (l ◦ T (t))t>0. Feller’s Pettis integrals allow to
construct operators taking values on some subspace ˜X of X∗, and he shows that
there exists a rather large closed subspace X1 of ˜X such that the map t → T (t)x
is continuous on (0, +∞) for x ∈ X1.

Arveson’s conditions are more restrictive, but his approach allows to deﬁne a
norm-decreasing homomorphism φT from the convolution Banach algebra MωT
into B(X),without enlarging the Banach space X. Here MωT denotes the algebra
of all Borel measures µ on (0, +∞) such that

|f (t)|kT (t)kdt < +∞, identiﬁed to a closed ideal
on the half-line satisfying
of MωT, and let AT (resp. IT) be the closure of φT(MωT ) (resp φT(L1
ωT))
in B(X) with respect to the operator norm. The ideal IT of AT is called the
Arveson ideal associated to the semigroup T, see sections 2 and 3.

In section 4 we introduce the inﬁnitesimal generator AT,op as a weakly
densely deﬁned operator on the space X1 := [∪t>0T (t)(X)]− , following Feller’s
approach in [?], and we also introduce the resolvent Rop(T, λ) = (AT,op − λI)−1
as a weakly densely deﬁned operator on X1. If lim supt→0+ kT (t)k < +∞, these
partially deﬁned operators are closed operators on X1. In the general case they
can be interpreted as closed operators on X0 := X1/ [∩t>0Ker(T (t)] , which of
course equals X1 if ∩t>0Ker(T (t) = {0}.

ωT contains a function g such that g ∗ L1

In section 5 we pave the way to a more intrinsic aopproach to the inﬁnitesimal
generator of a Arveson weakly continuous semigroup T. It follows from some
results of [11] that L1
ωT is dense in
L1
ωT, and so IT possesses dense principal ideals, and it follows from the weak∗
continuity of the semigroup that uAT 6= {0} for every u ∈ AT \ {0}. This
allows us to apply to IT the theory of quasimultipliers developped a long time
ago by the author in [12]. Recall that if U is a Banach algebra such that
uU 6= {0} for u ∈ U \ {0} and such that the set Ω(U) := {u ∈ U | [uU]− = U}
is nonempty, a quasimultiplier on U is a closed densely deﬁned operator on U
of the form S = Su/v, where u ∈ U, v ∈ Ω(U), and where the domain DS of

2

S is the set of all x ∈ U such that ux ∈ vU. If x ∈ D, then Sx is the unique
y ∈ U such that ux = vy. A subset ∆ of the algebra QM(U) is said to be
pseudobounded if ∩S∈∆Ds contains some u ∈ Ω(U) such that supS∈∆ kSuk <
+∞. A quasimultiplier S ∈ QM(U) is said to be regular if there exists λ > 0
such that the set {λnSn}n≥1 is pseudobounded, and the family QMr(U) of all
regular quasimultipliers on U is a pseudo-Banach algebra in the sense of [1].

In section 6, we associate in a natural way to a quasimultiplier S on IT a
weakly densely deﬁned operator ˜S on X1. If ∩t>0Ker(T (t)) = {0} then ˜S has an
extension ˜S to a subspace of X1 which is a closed operator. In the general case
the domain of ˜S can be considered as a subspace of X0 := X1/ ∩t>0 Ker(T (t))
and ˜S has an extension ˜S to a subspace of X0 which is a closed operator.

In section 7 we use a variant of a construction introduced in [?] to deﬁne the
"normalized Arveson ideal" JT. Set ρT := limt→+∞ kT (t)k1/t. If λ > log(ρT),
then the family {e−λtT (t)}t>0} is pseudobounded. Set kukλ = supt>0 ke−λtT (t)uk ∈
[0, +∞] for u ∈ IT, set LT := {u ∈ IT | kukλ < +∞}, and denote by
UT the closure of ∪t>0T (t)IT in (LT, k.kλ). Then (LT, k.k)λ is a Banach al-
gebra, and the deﬁnition of LT and UT and the norm topology on LT and
UT do not depend on the choice of λ > log(ρT). We can identify the usual
multiplier algebra M(UT), which is a Banach algebra with respect to the op-
erator norm kSkop,λ, to a subalgebra of QMr(IT). The closure JT of IT in
(M(UT), kSkop,λ) is called the normalized Arveson ideal of the semigroup T.
The sequence (φT(fn ∗δǫn))n≥1 is a sequential bounded approximate identity for
JT for every Dirac sequence (fn)n≥1 and every sequence (ǫn)n≥1 of positive real
numbers which converges to 0, and the map S → S|UT is an isometric isomor-
phism from (M(JT), k.kM(JT)) onto (M(UT), k.kλ,op). The algebras UT, IT and
JT are similar in the sense of [12], and an explicit pseudobounded isomorphism
between the quasimultiplier algebras QM(JT) and QM(UT) or QM(IT) (resp.
between the algebras QMr(JT) and QMr(UT) or QMr(IT) ) is given by the
map Su/v → Sau/av where a ∈ Ω(UT). We have Ω(JT) ∩ UT ⊂ Ω(UT), and the
fact that Ω(JT) ∩ UT 6= ∅ follows from a construction based on inverse Laplace
transforms of outer functions on half-planes given by P. Koosis and the author
in section 6 of [11].

In section 8 we consider the generator AT of the semigroup as a quasi-
multiplier on the algebra IT or JT. To deﬁne the inﬁnitesimal generator as a
quasimultiplier on IT we use the formula

AT,IT = S−φT(f ′

limt→0+ k T (t)u−u
− vk = 0 for some v ∈ IT, then u belongs to the domain of
AT,IT and AT,ITu = v. It is also possible to consider the inﬁnitesimal generator
of the semigroup as a quasimultiplier on the normalized Arveson ideal JT. Set
˜ωT(t) = kT (t)kM(JT), and deﬁne ˜φT = M˜ωT → M(JT) by using the formula

group bounded in norm near 0 : if u ∈ JT, then u belongs to the domain of
AT,JT if and only if there exists v ∈ JT such that limt→0+ k T (t)u−u

Identify the multiplier algebras QM(IT) and QM(JT), and set AT =
AT,IT = AT,JT . Every character χ on IT extends in a unique way to a charac-
ter ˜χ on QM(IT), and there exists a unique complex number aχ = ˜χ(AT) such
that χ(T (t)) = etaχ for t > 0. If the Arveson ideal IT is not a radical algebra,
then the family σar(S) := { ˜χ(S)}χ∈
IT wil be called the Arveson spectrum of
c
a quasimultiplier s ∈ QM(IT), and we will use the convention σar(AT) = ∅ if
the algebra IT is radical. If IT is not radical, the map χ → ˜χ(AT) deﬁnes a
homeomorphism from

IT onto σar(AT), and we have, for f ∈ MωT,

c

˜χ(φT(f )) = L(f )(− ˜χ(AT)).
Similarly, we have ˜χ( ˜φT(f )) = L(f )(− ˜χ(AT)) for f ∈ M˜ωT , see section 9.
In section 10 we introduce the Arveson resolvent set Resar(AT) := {C \
σar(AT)}, and observe that AT − µI has an inverse (AT − µI)−1 in QM(IT)
for µ ∈ Resar(AT). More precisely this quasimultiplier (AT − µI)−1) belongs to
JT ⊂ QMr(IT), and the map µ → (AT − µI)−1) is an holomorphic map from
Resar(AT) into JT. If Re(λ) > −log(ρT), then we have the usual resolvent

α ).
After observing in section 11 that G(−AT) ∈ Ω(JT) if G ∈ H 1(Π+
α ) is
outer (this can be deduced from Nyman’s characterization of dense ideals of the
convolution algebra L1(R+), but we propose a direct proof), we deﬁne F (−AT)
for F ∈ ∪α<log(ρT)H ∞(Π+

α ) by using the formula

F (−AT) = SF H(−AT)/H(−AT) ∈ QMr(JT) = QMr(IT),

where F ∈ H ∞(Π+

α ) is outer on

Again, this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of H. When F = L(f ),
with f ∈ ∪λ>log(ρT)L1(R+, eλt), then F (−AT) = ˜φT(f ) ∈ JT. If F (z) = e−tz,
with t > 0, then F (−AT) = T (t). A similar formula allows to deﬁne F (−AT) ∈
QM(IT) = QM(JT), if F ∈ ∪α<log(ρT)N +(Π+

I. Chalendar, J. Partington and the author obtained in [7] lower estimates
for small values of ǫ of the norm of operators of the form F (−ǫAT), where F is
the Laplace transform of a real-valued measure on [a, b], with 0 < a < b < +∞,
and where T = (T (t))t>0 is a norm-continuous semigroup, see also [15],[13], [3].
The motivation for this paper was to open the road to extensions of these lower
estimates to much more general situations.

The idea of considering the inﬁnitesimal generator of a semigroup as a quasi-
multipier on a suitable Banach algebra associated to the semigroup is due to
Galé and Miana, who used this approach in [19] for the inﬁnitesimal generator
of some one-parameter groups of regular quasimultipliers, see also [18]. Chal-
endar, Partington and the author also used this approach for the inﬁnitesimal
generator on analytic semigroups. We deal here with a more general situation,
and the author hopes that this approach centered on quasimultipliers and regu-
lar quasimultipliers on the Arveson ideal IT will be helpful to mathematicians
who use holomorphic functional calculus associated to semigroups.

2 Arveson weakly continuous one-parameter semi-

groups

Let X = (X, k.k) be a Banach space. We denote by B(X) the Banach algebra
of bounded linear operators R : X → X with composition, we denote by GL(X)
the group of invertible elements of B(X) and we denote by I = IX the identity
map on X. We also denote by k.k the operator norm on B(X) associated to the
given norm on X, and we denote by ρ(R) the spectral radius of R ∈ B(X). If
Y is a subspace of the dual space X ′ of X we will denote by σ(X, Y ) the weak
topology on X associated to Y.

We will use the following notion, introduced by Arveson in [2].

Deﬁnition 2.1 Let X be a Banach space, and let X∗ be a subspace of the
dual space X ′. We will say that (X, X∗) is a dual pairing if the two following
conditions are satisﬁed:

1. kxk = sup{|hx, li|

:

l ∈ X∗, klk ≤ 1} for every x ∈ X.

2. The σ(X, X∗)-closed convex hull of every σ(X, X∗)-compact subset of X

is σ(X, X∗)-compact.

For example, (X, X ′) is a dual pairing. Also if X = Y ′ for some Banach space
Y, and if we identify Y to a subspace of X ′ = (Y ′)′ in the obvious way, then
(X, Y ) is a dual pairing, see [2]. Notice that condition 1 means that if we set
˜x(l) = hx, li for x ∈ X, l ∈ X∗ then the map x 7→ ˜x is an isometry from X into
the dual space (X∗)′. This means that the spaces X and X∗ are reciprocal in
the sense of deﬁnition 2 of [16]. An operator T ∈ B(X) is said to be weakly
continuous with respect to a dual pairing (X, X∗) if l ◦ T ∈ X∗ for every l ∈ X∗.
Let S be a locally compact space, and let (X, X∗) be a dual pairing. A map
u : S → X is said to be weakly continuous with respect to (X, X∗) if the map
s 7→ hu(s), li is continuous on S for every l ∈ X∗, and we will often just say
that u is weakly continuous when no confusion may occur. In this situation it
follows from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem and from condition 1 of deﬁnition
2.1 that we have, for every compact subset K of S,

sup

are given in [14].

Proposition 2.2 Let S be a locally compact space, let (X, X∗) be a dual pairing,
and let u : S → X be a weakly continuous map. Set ωu(s) = ku(s)k for s ∈
S, and denote by Mωu(S) the set of all regular measures µ on S such that
∗
S ku(s)kd|µ|(s) < +∞. Then for every µ ∈ Mωu(S) there exists

Shu(s), lidµ(s) for l ∈ X∗ deﬁnes an element fµ ∈ (X∗)′, and we have
fµ(l) :=

Denote by Mc(S) the space of all regular measures on S supported by some com-
pact subset of S. It follows from (2) that Mc(S) ⊂ Mωu(S), and the fact that
property (2.2) holds for every µ ∈ Mc(S) follows directly from [2], proposition
2.1. Set ˜X := {˜x : x ∈ X}. It follows from condition 1 of deﬁnition 2.1 that ˜X is
closed in (X∗)′. Let µ ∈ Mωu(S). There exists a sequence (µn)n≥1 of elements
of Mc(S) such that limn→+∞ kµ − µnkωu = 0. Hence limn→+∞ kfµ − fµn k = 0,
and fµ ∈ ˜X.
(cid:3)

When the conditions of proposition 2.2 are satisﬁed, we will use the notation

where the integral is a Pettis integral, that is a Bochner integral computed with
respect to the σ(X, X∗) topology, which deﬁnes an element of X since (X, X∗)
is a dual pairing.

Notice that since ωu is lower semicontinuous, it follows from the theory
of integration on locally compact spaces, see [4], chapter 4, that Mωu(S) is
the space of regular measures µ such that ωu is integrable with respect to the
total variation |µ| of µ, and it follows from [4], proposition 1, that we have for
µ ∈ Mωu(S)

Let X be a Banach space. A map T : t → T (t) from (0, +∞) into B(X)
is called a (one-parameter) semigroup if T (s + t) = T (s)T (t) for s > 0, t > 0.
We will often write T = (T (t))t>0. A semigroup will be said to be normalized
if ∪t>0T (t)(X) is dense in X.

We now introduce the following deﬁnition, which is an obvious extension to
one-parameter semigroups of the notion of weakly continuous group represen-
tations associated to a dual pairing, due to Arveson [2].

7

Deﬁnition 2.3 Let (X, X∗) be a dual pairing, and let Bw(X) the the space of
weakly continuous elements of B(X). A semigroup T = (T (t))t>0 ⊂ Bw(X)
is said to be weakly continuous with respect to the dual pairing (X, X∗) if the
function t →< T (t)x, l > is continuous on (0, +∞) for every x ∈ X and every
l ∈ X∗.

Let (X, X∗) be a dual pairing, and let T = (T (t))t>0 ⊂ Bw(X) be a weakly

continuous semigroup. We have, for t > 0,

kT (t)k = sup{|hT (t)x, li| : x ∈ X, kxk ≤ 1, l ∈ X∗, klk ≤ 1}

1

and so the weight ωT : t 7→ kT (t)k is lower semicontinuous on (0, +∞). Let
K ⊂ (0, +∞) be compact. Since supt∈K kT (t)xk < +∞ for every x ∈ X, it
follows again from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem that supt∈K kT (t)k < +∞. A
1
standard argument shows then that limt→+∞kT (t)k
sn =
sn for every s > 0. In this situation we can deﬁne the weighted
infn≥1kT (sn)k
space MωT = MωT[(0, +∞)] consisting of all regular measures µ on (0, +∞)
kT (t)kd|µ|(t) is ﬁnite. Since ωT(t1 + t2) ≤
such that the upper integral
ωT(t1)ωT(t2) for t1 > 0, t2 > 0, we see that µ and ν are convolable for µ, ν ∈
MωT and that (MωT, k.kωT) is a Banach algebra with respect to convolution
which contains the convolution algebra Mc[(0, +∞)] of compactly supported
regular measures on (0, +∞) as a dense subalgebra.

Also denote by C∞
c [(0, +∞)] the space of all inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions

fn(t)dt = 1 and if
there exists a sequence (an)n≥1 of positive real numbers which converges to 0

The following result is an easy analog of [2], proposition 1.4.

Proposition 2.4 Let (X, X∗) be a dual pairing, and let T = (T (t)t>0 ⊂ Bw(X)
be a weakly continuous semigroup. The Pettis integral

deﬁnes for every x ∈ X and every µ ∈ MωT an element of X, φT(µ) ∈ B(X)
for every µ ∈ MωT, and φT : µ 7→ φT(µ) is a norm-decreasing unital algebra
homomorphism from the convolution algebra MωT into B(X).

Moreover if (fn)n≥1 is a Dirac sequence, then we have, for t > 0

(ii)limn→+∞hφT(fn ∗ δt)x − T (t)x, li = 0 ∀x ∈ X, ∀l ∈ X∗.

Proof: Since kT (t)xk ≤ kT (t)kkxk, the fact that formula 5 deﬁnes an element

of X for x ∈ X and µ ∈ MωT follows directly from proposition 2.2. We have

and so φT(µ) ∈ B(X) for µ ∈ MωT and kφT(µ)k ≤ kµkωT. As observed in [2],
a routine application of Fubini’s theorem shows that φT(µ ∗ ν) = φT(µ)φT(ν)
for µ, ν ∈ Mc((0, +∞)). Since Mc((0, +∞)) is dense in MωT, this shows that
φT is an algebra homomorphism.

The last assertions pertain to folklore, but we give the details for the sake
of completeness. Let n ≥ 1, and let (fn)n≥1 be a Dirac sequence. We can
assume without loss of generality that fn(t) = 0 a.e. on [1, +∞) for n ≥ 1. The
sequence (fn)n≥1 is a sequential bounded approximate identity for L1(R+). So
if f ∈ L1

In the following (X, X∗) will denote a dual pairing and T = (T (t))t>0 ⊂
Bw(X) will denote a semigroup of bounded weakly continuous operators on
X which is weakly continuous with respect to this dual pairing (X, X∗). The

3 The Arveson ideal

Denote by X1 = [∪t>0T (t)(X)]− the closure of the space ∪t>0T (t)(X) in
(X, k.k). Since Mc((0, +∞)) is dense in MT, we have φT(µ)x ∈ X1 for µ ∈
MωT, x ∈ X. So we may consider φT as an element of B(X1) for every µ ∈ MωT,
and kφT(µ)kB(X) ≥ kφT(µ)kB(X1) for every µ ∈ MT. The trivial example ob-
tained by setting T (t) = P for t > 0, where P : X → Im(P ) is a projection
satisfying kP kB(X) > 1, shows that equality does not hold in general.

Deﬁnition 3.1 We will denote by AT the closed subalgebra of B(X1) generated
by φT (MωT), and by IT the closed subalgebra of B(X1) generated by φT (L1
ωT ),
so that IT is a closed ideal of AT, called the Arveson ideal of the semigroup T.

The fact that IT is an ideal of AT follows from the fact that L1

ωT is an ideal

of the convolution algebra MωT, so that φT (L1

ωT) is an ideal of φT (MωT).

Proposition 3.2 (i) The map t → T (t)u is norm-continuous on (0, +∞) for
every u ∈ IT.

(ii) The ideal IT equals the whole algebra AT if and only if the semigroup

(T (t))t>0 is continuous with respect to the norm of B(X).

(iii) If the σ(X∗, X)-closed convex hull of every σ(X∗, X)-compact subset of
X is σ(X∗, X)-compact, then all elements of AT are weakly continuous with
respect to X∗.

Proof: The map t → δt ∗ f is continuous on (0, +∞) for every f ∈ L1
Hence the map t → T (t)φT(f ) is continuous on (0, +∞) for every f ∈ L1
Since supa≤t≤bkT (t)k < +∞ for 0 < a < b < +∞, this shows that (i) holds.

ωT.
ωT.

Now assume that the semigroup is continuous with respect to the norm
on B(X). A well-known argument, see for example proposition 6.1 in [11],
shows then that T (t) ∈ IT for every t > 0. Hence φT(µ) ∈ IT for every µ ∈
Mc((0, +∞)). Since Mc((0, +∞)) is dense in MωT, this shows that AT = IT.
Conversely it follows immediately from (i) that if IT = AT then the semi-

group (T (t))t>0 is continuous with respect to the norm of B( ˜X).

Now assume that the σ(X∗, X)-closed convex hull of every σ(X∗, X)-compact
subset of X is σ(X∗, X)-compact. Then (X∗, X) is a dual pairing, and we see as
in the proof of the second assertion of proposition 1.4 of [2] that l ◦ φT(µ) ∈ X∗
for µ ∈ MωT, l ∈ X∗. Hence l ◦ u ∈ X∗ for u ∈ AT, l ∈ X∗. (cid:3)

Proposition 3.3 Let u ∈ AT. If uv = 0 for every v ∈ IT, then u = 0.

10

Proof: Let (fn)n≥1 be a Dirac sequence, and let ǫn be a sequence of positive

real numbers such that limn→+∞ ǫn = 0. We have, for x ∈ X, l ∈ X∗, t > 0,

< uT (t)x, l >=< T (t)ux, l >= limn→+∞ < φT (fn ∗ δǫn ∗ δt)ux, l >=

= lim

n→+∞

< uφT(fn ∗ δǫn)T (t)x, l >= 0.

Hence uT (t)x = 0 for every x ∈ X, and so u = 0 since ∪t>0T (t)X is dense

in X1. (cid:3)

Recall that a sequence (en)n≥1 of elements of a commutative Banach algebra
A is said to be a sequential bounded approximate identity for A if supn≥1kenk <
+∞ and if limn→+∞kaen − ak = 0 for every a ∈ A.

Proposition 3.4 If limsupt→0+kT (t)k < +∞, then the sequence φT(fn)n≥1
is a bounded sequential approximate identity for IT for every Dirac sequence
(fn)n≥1.

Proof: Assume that limsupt→0+kT (t)k < +∞, and set M = sup0<t≤1kT (t)k.
Then kφT(fn)k ≤ M when n is suﬃciently large. Since (fn)n≥1 is a sequential
bounded approximate identity for L1(R+), and since supa≤t≤bkT (t)k < +∞
for 0 < a < b < +∞, we see that limn→+∞kfn ∗ f − f kL1
= 0, so that
limn→+∞kφT(fn) ∗ φT(f ) − φT(f )k = 0 for f ∈ Cc((0, +∞)). Since the se-
quence (φT(fn))n≥1 is bounded, this shows that limn→+∞kφT(fn) ∗ u − uk = 0
for u ∈ IT. (cid:3)

4 The generator as a weakly densely deﬁned op-

erator

We consider as above the operators (T (t))t>0 as operators on the Banach space
X1 := [∪t>0T (t)X]− . We set

˜X := {x ∈ X1 |

lim
t→0+
We will use the convention T (0) = IX1 , the identity map on X1.

< T (t)x − x, l >= 0 ∀l ∈ X∗}.

Clearly, ∪t>0T (t)(X) ⊂ ˜X, and [∩t>0Ker(T (t)]∩ ˜X = {0}. Notice that if x ∈
˜X, it follows from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem that lim supt→0+ kT (t)xk =lim
supt→0+ kT (t)xk(X∗)′ < +∞. Also if lim supt>0kT (t)k < +∞, then ˜X is closed,
so that ˜X = X1.

The following deﬁnition is a variant of a deﬁnition introduced by Feller in

[16] for semigroups satisfying some weak measurability conditions.

Deﬁnition 4.1 Denote by DT,op the space of all x ∈ X1 such that there exists
y ∈ ˜X satisfying

lim
t→0+

<

T (t)x − x
t

− y, l >= 0 ∀l ∈ X∗.

(8)

11

In this situation we set AT,opx = y.

Notice that if x ∈ DT,op, then AT,opx ∈ X1. Also l ◦ T (t) ∈ X∗ for every
t > 0 and every l ∈ X∗, and so when condition (8) is satisﬁed by x and y we
have limt→0+ < T (t+s)x−T (s)x

− y, l >= 0 for every l ∈ X∗ and every s > 0.

t

If x ∈ DT,op, and if y = AT,opx, then we have, for l ∈ X∗, t > 0,

< T (t)x − x, l >=

t

Z
0

< T (s)y, l > dt,

and so, according to the notations of formula (4), we have

T (t)x − x =

t

Z

0

T (s)yds.

(9)

Conversely, if y ∈ ˜X, and if T (t)x − x =

t
0 T (s)yds for t > 0, then x and y

obviuously satisfy (8) and so x ∈ DT,op, and y = AT,opx.

Proposition 4.2 Set ρT = limt+∞ kT (t)k

In other terms, according to the notations of formula (6), we have

Then Rop(T, λ)y ∈ DT,op for y ∈ ˜X, Rop(T, λ) : ˜X → DT,op is one-to-one

and onto, and we have

(λIX1 − AT,op) ◦ Rop(T, λ) = I ˜X ,

Rop(T, λ) ◦ (λIX1 − AT,op) = IDT,op .

Proof: The proof is standard, and we give the details for the sake of com-
pleteness. Let y ∈ ˜X. Since
e−Re(λ)skT (s)ykds < +∞, Rop(T, λ)y is
well-deﬁned. Set x = Rop(T, λ)y. Since l ∗ T (t) ∈ X∗ for every l ∈ X∗ and every

We obtain, for l ∈ X∗,

and so x ∈ DT,op, and AT,opx = λx − y, y = λx − AT,opx.

This shows that Rop(T, λ)( ˜X) ⊂ DT,op, and that (λIX1 − AT,op)◦Rop(T, λ) =

I ˜X , and so RT,op(λ) : ˜X → DT,op is one-to-one.

Conversely let x ∈ DT,op, set u = AT,opx, and set S(t) = e−λtT (t) for t > 0.
Then x ∈ DS,op, and if we set y = AS,opx we have y = u − λx. We have, for
t > 0,

S(t)x − x =

IDT,op . (cid:3)

Proposition 4.3 The domain DT,op of AT,op is weakly dense in X1.

Hence DT,op is weakly dense in ∪t>0T (t)(X), and so DT,op is weakly dense

in X1. (cid:3)

Recall that a partially deﬁned operator S : D → E on a Banach space E is
said to be closed if the graph {x, Sx : x ∈ D} of S is closed. Notice that if lim
supt→0+ kT (t)k < +∞, then ˜X = X1, and so R(T, λ) : ˜X → DT,op ⊂ ˜X is a
bounded operator. Hence its inverse λI ˜X − AT,op : DT,op → ˜X is closed, and
AT,op is also closed. Now assume that (X∗, X) is also a dual pair, which means
that the σ(X∗, X)-closed convex hull of every σ(X∗, X)-compact subset of X∗ is
σ(X∗, X)-compact. Set uλ(t) = e−λt for λ ∈ C, t ≥ 0. Then RT,op(λ) = φT(uλ)
for Re(λ) > ρT, and so it follows from proposition 3.2(iii) that RT,op(λ) is

13

weakly continuous with respect to X∗, which shows as above that AT,op is
weakly closed.

Check that the inﬁnitesimal generator is not closed if lim supt→0+ kT (t)k =

5 Quasimultipliers on the Arveson ideal

If U be a commutative Banach algebra, set Ω(U) := {u ∈ U | [uU]− = U}, and
set U ⊥ = {u ∈ U | uU = {0}}. We recall the deﬁnition of quasimultipliers, a
notion introduced by the author in [12].

Deﬁnition 5.1 [12] Assume that Ω(U) 6= ∅ and that U ⊥ = {0}. A quasimulti-
plier on U is a pair (Su/v, DSu/v ), where u ∈ U, v ∈ Ω(U), where DSu/v is the
ideal of U consisting of those x ∈ U such that ux ∈ vU, and where Su/vx is the
unique y ∈ U such that ux = vy for x ∈ DSu/v . The set of quasimultipliers on
U will be denoted by QM(U), and a set B ⊂ QM(U) will be said to be pseu-
dobounded if there exists x ∈ [∩S∈BDS] ∩ Ω(U) such that supS∈BkSxk < +∞.

The quasimultipliers on U form an algebra, which is isomorphic to the alge-
bra of fractions U/Ω(U). Notice that since Ω(U) is stable under products, the
product of two pseudobounded sets is pseudobounded, which gives QM(U) a
structure of "algèbre à bornés".

The algebra QM(U) is in some sense too large, since u in invertible in

QM(U) for every u ∈ Ω(U), so it is natural to consider the following class.

Deﬁnition 5.2 [12] A quasimultiplier R ∈ QM(U) is said to be regular if there
exists λ > 0 such that the family (λnRn)n≥1 is pseudobounded. The set of regular
quasimultipliers on U will be denoted by QMr(U), and a set B ⊂ QMr(U) will
be said to be multiplicatively pseudobounded if it is contained in some set of the
form λV , where λ > 0 and where V is a pseudobounded subset of QMr(U)
which is stable under products.

Recall that a multiplier on U is a bounded linear map S : U → U such
that (Su)v = S(uv) for (u, v) ∈ U. The set M(U) of multipliers on M(U) is a
closed subalgebra of B(U), and U can be identiﬁed to an ideal of M(U) in an
obvious way. We also have the obvious identiﬁcation M(U) := {S = Su/v ∈
QM(U) |DSu/v ) = U} ⊂ QMr(U).

Equipped with the family of all its multiplicatively pseudobounded subsets,
the set QMr(U) forms an algebra which is a pseudo-Banach algebra in the sense
of Allan, Dales and McClure [1]. In particular every maximal ideal of QMr(U)
is the kernel of a character of QMr(U), and QMr(U) is an inductive limit of
commutative Banach algebras.
In fact regular quasimultipliers on U can be
turned into multipliers in the usual sense by modifying the algebra U, as will be
seen later.

ω := L1

characterization of dense ideals of L1(R+), show that if ω is a positive, contin-
uous, nonincreasing submultiplicative weight on (0, +∞) the convolution alge-
ω(R+) contains an inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable convolution semigroup
bra L1
(a(t))t>0 such that a(t) ∗ L1
ω for every t > 0, [11], theorem 6.8.
This result uses the fact that if f is a continuous function on (0, +∞) such that
lim supt→∞ f (t) < +∞, then there exists a continuously diﬀerentiable function
h on (0, +∞) such that h(t) ≥ f (t) for t > 0, and the rather sophisticated
contruction, applied to the function f : t → e−λtω(t) for some suitable λ ∈ R,
consists in ﬁnding a convolution semigroup (a(t))t>0 of functions in L1(R+)
such that lim supt→0+ h(t)ka(t)k < +∞ and such that the convolution ideal
generated by a(t) is dense in L1(R+) for every t > 0 (which implies that the
Laplace tranform of a(t) is an outer function of the right-hand half-plane). The
fact that a(t) ∗ L1
ω follows from Cohen’s factorization theorem for
modules over commutative Banach algebras with bounded approximate identi-
ties, which implies that every f ∈ L1
ω can we written under the form f = g ∗ h,
where g ∈ L1(R+) and h ∈ L1
ω.

ω is dense in L1

Now assume that f is positive and lower semicontinuous on (0, +∞), so that
f is bounded on [a, b] for 0 < a < b < +∞, and that lim supt→+∞ f (t) <
t
+∞. Set f1(t) = sups≥tf (s), f2(t) = 2
t/2 f1(s)ds. Then f1 is nonincreasing,
t
R
f1(s/2) ≥ f2(s) ≥ f1(s) ≥ f (s), and applying the previous result to f2 we see
that there exists a continuously diﬀerentiable function h on (0, +∞) such that
h(t) ≥ f (t) for t > 0. This shows that the construction used in the proof of
theorem 6.8 of [11] extends to lower-semicontinuous weights on (0, +∞). Set
uλ(t) = eλt for t > 0. Since the map f → f u−λ is a norm-preserving homo-
ω(R+) onto the convolution algebra
morphism from the convolution algebra L1
uλω(R+) for λ ∈ R, we obtain the following result.

such that limn→+∞ kθT(fn) − vwnk = 0. It follows then from proposition 2.4
(ii) that we have, for x ∈ X, l ∈ X∗, t > 0,

limn→+∞ < vT (t)wnx − T (t)x, l >= 0.

Since vT (t)wnx = T (t)wnvx = 0, we have x ∈ ∩t>0Ker(T (t)). Since (∩t>0Ker(T (t))∩

˜X = {0}, this shows that v is one-to-one on ˜X. (cid:3).

Proposition 6.2 Let S = Su/v ∈ QM(IT). Set D ˜S := {x ∈ X | ux ∈ v( ˜X)},
and denote by ˜S(x) the unique y ∈ ˜X satisfying ux = vy. Then D ˜S is weakly
dense in X1. If lim supt→0+ kT (t)k < +∞, then ˜S is a closed partially deﬁned
operator on X1, and ˜S is weakly closed if, further, the σ(X∗, X)-closed convex
hull of every σ(X∗, X)-compact subset of X∗ is σ(X∗, X)-compact.

Proof: It follows from the lemma that ˜S is well-deﬁned on D ˜S. Since vIT is
dense in IT, we see as above there exists a sequence (wn)n≥1 of elements of IT
such that we have, for x ∈ X, l ∈ X∗, t > 0,

limn→+∞ < vT (t)wnx − T (t)x, l >= 0.

Since uvT (t)wn = vuT (t)wn ∈ v( ˜X), we have T (t)wnx ∈ D ˜S for t > 0, n ≥
1, x ∈ X, and we see that the closure of D ˜S in X1 with respect to the weak
topology σ(X, X∗) contains T (t)(X) for every t > 0, which shows that D ˜S is
weakly dense in X1.

If lim supt→0+ kT (t)k < +∞, then ˜X = X1, and D ˜S = {x ∈ X1 | ux ∈
v(X1)}. Let (x, y) ∈ X1 × X1, and assume that there exists a sequence (xn)n≥1
of elements of D ˜S such that limn→+∞kx − xnk =limn→+∞ky − ˜Sxnk = 0. Then
ux =limn→+∞uxn =limn→+∞vyn = vy. Hence x ∈ D ˜S and y = ˜Sx, which
shows that ˜S is a closed operator. Now if the σ(X∗, X)-closed convex hull of

16

every σ(X∗, X)-compact subset of X∗ is σ(X∗, X)-compact, then u and v are
weakly continuous, and a similar argument using generalized sequences shows
that ˜S is weakly closed. (cid:3)

Assume that ∩t>0Ker(T (t) = {0}. Then v is one-to-one on X1 for every

v ∈ Ω(IT). If S = Su/v ∈ QM(IT), then we can set

D ˜S

:= {x ∈ X1 |ux ∈ v(X1)},

,

and deﬁne ˜S : D ˜S

by the formula

v( ˜Sx) = ux (x ∈ D ˜S

).

(11)

(12)

Then ˜S is a closed extension of ˜S, and ˜S is also weakly closed if lim supt→0+ kT (t)k <

+∞.

To deal with the general case observe that if x ∈ X1, and if T (s)x ∈
∩t>0T (t)(X) for every s > 0, then T (t)(x) = T (t/2)(T (t/2)x) = 0 for every t >
0. So if we set X0 := X1/∩t>0 Ker(T (t)), and if we set ˜T (t)x+∩t>0Ker(T (t)) =
T (t)x + ∩t>0Ker(T (t)) for x ∈ X1, t > 0, then ∩t>0Ker( ˜T (t)) = {0}. Now if
u ∈ AT, then u(∩t>0Ker(T (t)) ⊂ (∩t>0Ker(T (t)), and we can deﬁne ˜u : X0 →
X0 by the formula

˜u(x + (∩t>0Ker(T (t))) = ux + (∩t>0Ker(T (t))) (x ∈ X1),

and the same argument as in the proof of lemma 6.1 shows that if v ∈ Ω(IT),
and if vx ∈ ∩t>0Ker(T (t)) for some x ∈ X1, then x ∈ ∩t>0Ker(T (t)), so that
˜v is one-to-one on X0.

This suggests the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 6.3 Let S = Su/v ∈ QM(IT). Set D ˜S
The operator ˜S : D ˜S

→ X0 is deﬁned by the formula

:= {y ∈ X0/ | ˜uy ∈ ˜v(X0)}.

˜v

˜Sy
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

= ˜uy,

(y ∈ D ˜S

).

We see that ˜S is a closed operator on X0, which may be considered as an

extension of ˜S since (∩t>0Ker(T (t))) ∩ ˜X = {0}.

7 The normalized Arveson ideal

It follows from theorem 5.3 and proposition 5.4 that the family (e−λtT (t))t>0
is pseudobounded in QM(IT) for λ > limt→+∞ kT (t)k
t .We now apply to the
Arveson ideal IT and to the family (T (t))t>0 a slight modiﬁcation of construc-
tion performed by the author in [12] to embed a pseudobounded subset U stable
under products of the quasimultiplier algebra QM(A) of a Banach algebra A
such that A⊥ = {0} and Ω(A) 6= ∅ into a bounded set of the multiplier alge-
bra of some Banach algebra B which is "similar" to A. In order to do this set

1

17

L := {u ∈ A | kukL := supb∈U kbuk < +∞}, choose b ∈ L ∩ Ω(A), and denote
by U the closure of bL in (L, k.kL); then b2 ∈ Ω(U). The algebra B introduced
in [12] is the closure of A in M(L), the map T u/v → Tb2u/b2v deﬁnes a pseu-
dobounded isomorphism from QM(B) onto QM(A) and QM(U), and the given
pseudobounded set U is contained in the unit ball of M(B). This construction
was inspired by Feller’s discussion [17] of the generator of strongly continuous
semigroups which are not bounded near the origin, and we slightly modify it
below by replacing the multiplier algebra M(L) by the multiplier algebra M(U)
in order to obtain a norm-preserving isomorphism between the multiplier alge-
bras M(U) and M(B) in the case where U = {e−λtT (t)} for some suﬃciently
large real number λ. We will use the convention T (0)u = u for u ∈ IT.

Theorem 7.1 Set LT := {u ∈ IT | lim supt→0+ kT (t)uk < +∞} ⊃ ∪t>0T (t)IT,
choose λ > log(ρT), set kukλ := sups≥0e−λskT (s)uk for u ∈ LT, denote by UT
the closure of ∪t>0T (t)IT in (LT, k.kλ), and set kRkλ,op := sup{kRukλ | u ∈
UT, kukλ ≤ 1} = kRkM(UT) for R ∈ M(UT).

Then (LT, k.kλ) is a Banach algebra, the norm topology on LT does not
depend on the choice of λ, UT = {u ∈ LT | limt→0+ kT (t)u − ukλ = 0}, UT is
a dense ideal of IT, and the following properties hold

(i) kT (t)ukλ ≤
(ii) kT (t)kλ,op ≤ eλt for every t > 0.
(iii) RLT ⊂ LT and R(UT) ⊂ UT for every R ∈ M(IT), and kRkλ,op ≤

supt≥0 e−λskT (t + s)k
(cid:0)

kuk for u ∈ IT, t > 0.

(cid:1)

kRkM(IT). In particular kukλ,op ≤ kuk for every u ∈ AT.

(iv) ab ∈ UT for a ∈ LT, b ∈ LT.
(v) Ω(IT) ∩ LT 6= ∅, aLT is dense in UT for every a ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ LT, and

ab ∈ Ω(UT) for a ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ LT, b ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ LT.

Now denote by JT the closure of IT, identiﬁed to a subset of M(UT), in
(M(UT), k.kλ,op). Then (UT) is a dense ideal of (JT, k.kλ,op) and the following
properties hold

(vi) (φT(fn∗δǫn))n≥1 is a bounded sequential approximate identity for JT for
evey Dirac sequence (fn)n≥1 and every sequence (ǫn)n≥1 such that limn→+∞ ǫn =
0, and lim supn→+∞ kφT(fn ∗ δǫn)kλ,op = 1.

(vii) Ru ∈ UT for every R ∈ M(JT) and every u ∈ UT, and the map

R → R|UT is a norm-preserving isomorphism from M(JT) onto M(UT).

(viii) If a ∈ Ω(UT) then the map Tu/v → Tau/av deﬁnes a pseudbounded
isomorphism from QM(JT) onto QM(IT) and from QM(JT) onto QM(UT).
The Banach algebra JT, which is a closed ideal of its multiplier agebra

M(JT), will be called the normalized Arveson ideal of the semigroup T.

Proof: Let λ > log(ρT), and ﬁx a > 0. Set k(a) = sups≥ae−λskT (s)k.

Property (i) follows from the deﬁnition of the norm k.kλ, and we have

kukλ ≤ max( sup
0≤s≤a

ke−λsT (s)uk, k(a)kuk) ≤ max(e|λ|a sup
0≤s≤a

kT (s)uk, k(a)kuk)

≤ max(e|λ|a, k(a)) sup
0≤s≤a

kT (s)uk,

sup
0≤s≤a

kT (s)uk ≤ e|λ|a sup
0≤s≤a

e−λskT (s)uk ≤ e|λ|akukλ,

which shows that all the norms k.kλ are equivalent to the norm u → sup0≤s≤a kT (s)uk.
The construction of LT is the ﬁrst part of the construction of theorem 7.11 of
[12] applied to the pseudobounded family stable under products {e−λtT (t)}t>0.
It follows then from theorem 7.11 of [12] that (LT, k.kλ) is a Banach algebra,
and (ii) follows from the fact that kT (t)ukλ ≤ eλtkukλ for u ∈ LT, t > 0. It
also follows from theorem 7.11 of [12] that LT is an ideal of M(IT) ⊃ AT and
that we have the obvious inequality kRkop,λ ≤ kRkM(IT) for every R ∈ M(IT),
which implies that LT is an ideal of AT and that kakop,λ ≤ kak for every
a ∈ AT. This implies that R(UT) ⊂ UT for every R ∈ M(IT), which completes
the proof of (iii).

Set q(u) = sup0≤s≤1 kT (s)uk for u ∈ LT, so that the norm q is equivalent to

the norm k.kλ on LT.

Let t > 0 and let u ∈ IT. Set k := supt/2≤s≤t/2+1kT (s)k. Then q(T (t+ r)u −
T (t)(u)) ≤ kkT (t/2+r)u−T (t/2)uk and so lim supr→0+ q(T (r)T (t)u−T (t)u) =
0.

It follows then from (ii) that ˜IT ⊂ {u ∈ LT | limt→0+ kT (t)u − ukλ = 0},
and in fact UT = {u ∈ LT | limt→0+ kT (t)u−ukλ = 0}, since the other inclusion
is trivial.

Let a ∈ LT, b ∈ LT. There exists a sequence (un)n≥1 of elements of

∪t>0T (t)IT such that limn→+∞ kb − unk = 0, and we have

lim sup

n→+∞

kab − aunkλ ≤ kakλ lim sup

n→+∞

kb − unk = 0.

Hence ab ∈ UT, which proves (iv).

Now let a ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ LT. Then aLT ⊂ UT. Let u ∈ IT, and let (un)n≥1
be a sequence of elements of IT such that limn→+∞ ku − aunk = 0. It follows
from (i) that limn→+∞ kT (t)u − T (t)aunkλ = 0, and so the closure of aLT in
(UT, k.k) contains ∪t>0T (t)IT, hence coincides with UT. An easy veriﬁcation
given in the proof of theorem 7.11 of [12] shows then that ab ∈ Ω(UT) for
a ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ LT, b ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ LT. Notice that the ideals LT and UT play with
respect to IT and the family (e−λtT (t) the role played by the ideals L and U
with respect to the Banach algebra A and the pseudobounded family U stable
under products in the construction of theorem 7.11 of [12].

Now identify IT to a subset of M(UT), and denote by JT the closure of IT
in (M(UT), k.kλ,op). By construction, UT is an ideal of JT which is dense in
JT since it contains ∪t>0T (t)IT. Then the Banach algebras UT, IT and JT are
similar in the sense of [12], deﬁnition 7.4 and the natural injection IT → JT
in a s-homomorphism in the sense of [12], deﬁnition 7.9, and it follows from
theorem 7.11 of [12] that (viii) holds.

Let (fn)n≥1 be a Dirac sequence and let (ǫn)n≥1 be a sequence of positive
real numbers such that limn→+∞ ǫn = 0. There exists a sequence (δn)n≥1 of

19

positive real numbers such that limn→+∞ δn = 0 and such that fn(t) = 0 a.e.
for t > δn. Set en = φT(fn ∗ δǫn). We have

kenkλ,op ≤

δn

Z
0

fn(t)kT (t + ǫn)kdt,

and it follows from (ii) that lim supn→+∞ kenkλ,op ≤ 1. Since limn→+∞ kenu−
uk = 0 for u ∈ ∪t>0T (t)IT, we have a fortiori limn→+∞ kenu − ukλ = 0 for
u ∈ ∪t>0T (t)IT, and a standard density argument shows that limn→+∞ kenu −
ukλ=0 for u ∈ JT. Hence (en)n≥1 is a sequential approximate identity for JT
and satisﬁes limn→+∞kenkop,λ = 1. This implies that kukM(JT) = kukλ,op for
u ∈ JT.

Let u ∈ JT, let S ∈ M(UT). Since UT is dense in (IT, k.k), UT is dense in
IT with respect to k.kλ,op, and there exists a sequence (un)n≥1 of elements of
UT such that limn→+∞ ku − unkλ,op = 0. Then limn→+∞ kSu − Sunkλ,op = 0,
which shows that Su ∈ JT. Hence S : UT → UT has an extension ˜S to JT, and
k ˜SkM(JT) = kSλ,opk.

Writing T (t)u = T (t/2)T (t/2)u for t > 0, u ∈ IT, we deduce from proposi-
tion 2.4 and (ii) that limn→+∞ kT (t)u − T (t)uenkλ = 0. A standard density
argument shows then that limn→+∞ kuen − ukλ = 0 for every u ∈ UT. It
follows then from Cohen’s factorization theorem [8] for Banach modules over
commutative Banach algebras with bounded approximate identities that for ev-
ery u ∈ UT there exists v ∈ JT and w ∈ UT such that u = vw, kvkλ,op = 1
and kwkλ ≤ kukλ+ǫ. Hence Ru = (Rv)w ∈ UT for R ∈ M(JT). Also kRukλ ≤
kRvkλ,opkkwkλ ≤ kRkM(JT)(kukλ+ǫ) for every ǫ > 0, kRukλ ≤ kRkM(UT)kukλ,
which shows that RUT : UT → UT is bounded. So the map R → R|UT is a norm-
preserving isomorphism from M(JT) onto M(UT). (cid:3)

8 The generator as a quasimultiplier on the Arve-

son ideal

When S = Su/v, with u ∈ A, v ∈ Ω(A) is a quasimultiplier on a commutative
Banach algebra A such that Ω(A) 6= ∅ and aA 6= {0} for a ∈ A \ {0}, we will
write S = u/v if there is no risk of confusion.

Deﬁnition 8.1 : The inﬁnitesimal generator AT,IT of a Arveson weakly con-
tinuous semigroup T is the quasimultiplier on IT deﬁned by the formula

and similarly φT(f ′

2)/φT(f2) = φT(f ′

1)/φT(f1), which shows that the deﬁ-

nition of AT,IT does not depend on the choice of f0.

ωλ ⊂ L1

Let λ > log(ρT), and set again uλ(t) = eλt and ωλ(t) = eλt sups≥t e−λskT (s)k
ωλ, and every Dirac sequence (en)n≥1 is a sequen-
uλ. It follows from Cohen’s factorization
ωλ can be written under the form f = g ∗ h, where

uλ ∗ L1
for t > 0. Then L1
tial bounded approximate identity for L1
theorem [8] that every f ∈ L1
g ∈ L1

ωλ, which implies that Ω(L1

uλ and h ∈ L1

It is well-known that the subalgebra of the convolution algebra L1(R+) gen-
erated by uα is dense in L1(R+), for α < 0, see for example [11], so that uα
in Ω(L1(R+)) (this follows also from Nyman’s theorem [21]). So the function
uα ∗ uα : t → teαt generates a dense ideal of L1(R+), and if log(ρT) ≤ µ ≤ λ
then the function vλ : t → te−λt generates a dense ideal of L1
uµ . Notice that
vλ ∈ C∞([0, +∞)), that v′
uµ and that vλ(0) = 0. Using proposition 5.4, we
obtain the following result.

Proposition 8.2 : Let µ > log(ρT), let g0 ∈ C1([0, +∞)) ∩ Ω

AT,IT = −φT(g′

0 ∗ h0)/φT(g0 ∗ h0).

For example we can take g0 = vλ for some λ > log(ρT), so that g0(t) = te−λt

and g′

0(t) = (1 − λt)e−λt for t ≥ 0.

We can also consider the inﬁnitesimal generator of the semigroup as a quasi-
multiplier on the normalized Arveson ideal JT. Set ˜ωT := kT (t)kM(JT), and for
µ ∈ M˜ωT, deﬁne φT(µ) ∈ M(JT) by the formula

˜φT(µ)u =

Z

T (t)udµ(t)

(u ∈ JT).

(13)

Clearly, ˜φT(µ)u = φT(µ)u for u ∈ IT, µ ∈ MωT , and so we can consider

˜φT : M˜ωT → M(JT) as an extension to M˜ωT of φT : MωT → M(IT).

Deﬁnition 8.3 : The normalized inﬁnitesimal generator AT,JT of a Arveson
weakly continuous semigroup T is the quasimultiplier on JT deﬁned by the for-

˜φT(g′

8.2, the inﬁnitesimal generator AT,IT is the quasimultiplier on IT associated to

continuous on (0, +∞) and so there exists λ ∈ C such that ˜χ(T (t)) = e−λt for

10 The resolvent

We now wish to discuss the Arveson resolvent of the generator of a semigroup
T = (T (t))t>0 which is weakly continuous in the sense of Arveson. We identify
JT, M(JT) and AT to subalgebras of the algebra QM r(IT) of regular quasi-
multipliers on the Arveson ideal IT. We also identify the algebras QM (IT)
and QM (JT), and the algebras QM r(IT) and QM r(JT) by using the pseu-
dobounded isomorphisms described in the previous sections. From now on we
will write AT = AT,IT = AT,JT , and we will denote as before by DAT,JT (resp.
DAT,IT, resp. DAT,UT) the domain of AT considered as a quasimultiplier on
JT (resp. on IT, resp. on UT).

Deﬁnition 10.1 The Arveson resolvent set of AT is deﬁned by the formula

Resar(AT) = C \ σar(AT),

with the convention σar(AT) = ∅ if IT is radical.

We will denote by I the unit element of QM (IT), so that JT ⊕ CI is a
closed subalgebra of the Banach algebra M(JT). We set as above uλ(t) = eλt
for λ ∈ C, t ≥ 0. We obtain the usual "resolvent formula".

Proposition 10.2 The quasimultiplier λI − AT ∈ QM (IT) admits an inverse
(λI − AT)−1 ∈ JT ⊂ QM r(IT) for λ ∈ Resar(AT), and the map λ → (λI −
AT)−1 is an holomorphic map from Resar(AT) into JT. Moreover we have, for
Re(λ) > log(ρT),

(λI − AT)−1 = ˜φ(T)(u−λ) =

e−λsT (s)ds ∈ JT,

and so av ∈ DAT,JT, and AT(av) = λav−v. This shows that aJT ⊂ DAT,JT ,
and that (λI − AT)av = v for every v ∈ JT. We have λI − AT = Su/v, where

25

u ∈ JT, v ∈ Ω(JT), and we see that ua = v. Hence u ∈ Ω(IT), λI − AT is
invertible in QM(JT), and (λI − AT)−1 = a = ˜φT(u−λ) =
e−λtT (t)dt ∈
JT, where the Bochner integral is computed with respect to the strong operator
topology on M(JT).

Set again a = ˜φT(u−λ) = (λI −AT)−1, where λ is a complex number satisfy-
ing Re(λ) > log(ρT). Let χ0 be the character on JT ⊕ CI such that Ker(χ0) =
JT. Every character on JT ⊕ CI distinct from χ0 has the form ˜χ|JT⊕CI for some
χ ∈

IT. It follows from formula (15) that ˜χ(a) = L(u−λ)(− ˜χ(AT)) =

λ− ˜χ(AT)

for χ ∈

IT, and we obtain, for µ ∈ C,

λ − ˜χ(AT) (cid:27)χ∈

c

.

So I + (µ − λ)a is invertible in JT ⊕ Ce for µ ∈ Resar(AT), and the map
µ → a(I + (µ − λ)a)−1 ∈ IT is holomorphic on Resar(AT). We have, for
µ ∈ Resar(AT),

(µI − AT)a(I + (µ − λ)a)−1 = ((µ − λ)I + (λ − AT))a(I + (µ − λ)a)−1

= (I + (µ − λ)a)(I + (µ − λ)a)−1 = I.

Hence (µI − AT) has an inverse (µI − AT)−1 ∈ JT for λ ∈ Resar(AT), and
the map µ → (µI − AT)−1 = a(I + (µ − λ)a)−1 is holomorphic on Resar(AT).
(cid:3)

(cid:0)

(µI − AT)−1v

If we consider AT as a quasimultiplier on JT, the fact that (µI −AT)−1 ∈ JT
is the inverse of µI − AT for µ ∈ Res(AT) means that (µI − AT)−1v ∈ DAT,JT
and that (µI − AT)
= v for every v ∈ JT, and that if w ∈
DAT,JT , then (µI − AT)−1 ((µI − AT)w) = w. The situation is slightly more
complicated if we consider AT as a quasimultiplier on IT when lim supt→0+ kT (t)k =
+∞. In this case the domain D(µI−AT)−1,IT of (µI − AT)−1 ∈ QM (IT) is
a proper subspace of IT containing UT ⊃ ∪t>0T (t)IT, and we have (µI −
(µI − AT)−1v
AT)−1v ∈ DAT,IT and (µI−AT)
Also if w ∈ DAT,IT , then (µI − AT)w ∈ D(µI−AT)−1,IT, and we have (µI −
AT)−1 ((µI − AT)w) = w.

= v for every v ∈ D(µI−AT)−1,IT.

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

In order to interpret (λI − AT)−1 as a partially deﬁned operator on IT for

Re(λ) > log(ρT), we can use the formula

(λI − AT)−1v =

+∞

Z
0

e−λtT (t)vdt

(v ∈ UT),

(16)

which deﬁnes a quasimultiplier on IT if we apply it to some v ∈ Ω(IT) ∩ UT.
The fact that this quasimultiplier is regular is not completely obvious but follows
from the previous discussion since (λI − AT)−1 ∈ JT ⊂ QM r(IT). Notice that
since ∪t>0T (t)IT is dense in (UT, k.kUT), (λI − AT)−1 is characterized by the
simpler formula

(λI − AT)−1T (s)v = eλs

(17)

Using the correspondence between quasimultipliers on IT and partially de-
ﬁned operators on X1 = [∪t>0T (t)X]− and X0 = X1/∩t>0Ker(T (t)), we obtain
a new approach to the resolvent formula and the other results of section 4.

Let F = G/H ∈ N +(Πα), where G ∈ H ∞(Πα) and H ∈ H ∞(Πα) is outer,
and let U ∈ H 1(Πα) ∩ H ∞(Πα) be outer (for example one can take U (z) =

HU ∈ H 1(Πα) ∩ H ∞(Πα) is outer. This observation allows to extend the

(iv) If F (z) = −z, then F (−AT) = AT.

of QM(JT) = QM(IT) if H ∈ H 1(Πα) is an outer function such that F H ∈

It follows from the proposition that we have

(F H)(−AT)H1(−AT) = (F HH1)(−AT) = (F H1)(−AT)H(−AT),

This shows that F (−AT) is a regular mutiplier on JT, and F (−AT) ∈

QMr(JT) = QMr(IT), which completes the proof of (i).

In particular if F (z) = e−tz for some t ≥ 0 we have F (−AT) = L(δt)(−AT) =

˜φT(δt) = T (t), which completes the proof of (iii).

Let again α < −log(ρT), and set f (t) = t2e(α−1)t for t ≥ 0. Then L(f )(z) =

Set F (z) = −z. We have −L(f ′) = F L(f ) ∈ H 1(Πα), and

F (−AT) = −L(f ′)(−AT)/L(f )(−AT) = − ˜φT(f ′)/ ˜φT(f ) = AT,

which proves the tautological assertion (iv). (cid:3)

Set again uα(t) = eαt and ωα(t) = eαtsups≥te−αskT (s)k. We can also

˜φT(f u−ǫ) = L(f u−ǫ)(−AT),

and L(f u−ǫ)(z) = L(f )(z + ǫ). The quasimultiplier L(f u−ǫ)(−AT) may be

then computed by using (21), with α = −ρT − ǫ.

When the semigroup is analytic on a sector, one can use Cauchy’s formula to
deﬁne F (−AT) for functions F belonging to the H 1 space of a suitable family
of sectors. We will not do it here.
