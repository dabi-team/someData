After the introduction of the ionization-injection scheme in Laser Wake Field Acceleration and
of related high-quality electron beam generation methods as two-color or the Resonant Multi Pulse
Ionization injection, the theory of thermal emittance by C. Schroeder et al. has been used to predict
the beam normalised emittance obtainable with those schemes. In this manuscript we recast and
extend such a theory, including both higher order terms in the polinomial laser ﬁeld expansion
and non polinomial corrections due to the onset of saturation eﬀects in a single cycle. Also, a
very accurate model for predicting the cycle-averaged 3D momentum distribution of the extracted
electrons, including saturation and multi-process events, is proposed and tested. We show that
our theory is very accurate for the selected processes of Kr8+→10+
, resulting in a
a maximum error below 1% even in deep saturation regime. This highly accurate prediction of
the beam phase-space can be implemented e.g.
in laser-envelope Particle in Cell (PIC) or hybrid
PIC-ﬂuid codes, to correctly mimic the cycle-averaged momentum distribution without the need of
resolving the intra-cycle dynamics. Finally, we introduce further spatial averaging with Gaussian
longitudinal and transverse laser proﬁles, obtaining expressions for the whole-beam emittance that
ﬁts with Monte Carlo simulations in a saturated regime, too.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the past decades, many injection schemes of elec-
tron beams in the accelerating wakeﬁeld excited by laser
pulses [1–4] have been proposed and tested. Among
them, injection by background density variation [5–12],
collinear colliding pulses injection [13–15] and multi-pulse
ionization injection schemes as Two Color ionization in-
jection [16, 17] and Resonant Multi-Pulse Ionization in-
jection (ReMPI) [18–20] are very promising in terms of
transverse beam quality, being capable of generating elec-
tron beams with normalized emittances as low as tens-
of-nm, as shown by analytical results and numerical sim-
ulations.

Accuracy of numerical simulations of ionization in-
jection processes can be extremely challenging when
schemes providing good-quality beams are investigated,
as those required to accelerate electron bunches suitable
to drive X-ray Free Electron Laser for the EuPRAXIA
project [21] or similar projects based on high gradient
plasma accelerator [22]. This is because the longitudi-
nal grid spacing should be small enough to eﬃciently
resolve the extraction process, occurring in a tiny frac-
tion (usually ≈ 1/5) of the ionization pulse wavelength.
The use of reduced envelope models in conjunction with
analytical models to correctly mimic the newborn elec-
trons phase-space (e.g. QFluid [18, 23], INF&RNO [24],
ALaDyn [25, 26] and Smilei [27, 28]) can therefore be
advantageous when long and large grid-size simulations
In this respect, highly accurate analytical
are needed.

predictions of the rms transverse momentum, or even
more accurate models for the phase-space distribution
of the extracted electrons are needed. In a seminal pa-
per of 2014, C. Schroeder et al. [29] set for the ﬁrst time
a comprehensive theory of ionization injection thermal
emittance with a single laser pulse. This theory is cur-
rently used in the codes cited above and constitutes the
state-of-the-art of the analytical results for single pulse
ionization injection schemes, to the authors’ knowledge.
In the following, we will suppose that the ionization
laser pulse of amplitude a0, with polarization axis x
and carrier wavelength λ0 is propagating along positive
z. Its amplitude is large enough to provide an electric
ﬁeld above the ionization threshold for the tunnel ﬁeld-
ionization process. Once electrons are extracted from the
ions, their dynamics follow the prescription for a generic
charged particle in an (almost) plane-wave laser pulse.
After averaging the momenta during the whole ﬁrst laser
pulse oscillation, we obtain the initial cycle-average nor-
malised 3D momentum (cid:126)u = (cid:126)p/mec (see [28] and refer-
ences therein)

where ξe is the ionization pulse phase at the extraction
time and a0,e is the local normalised pulse amplitude
at the extraction position. As the electrons slip-back
in the laser ﬁeld, their quivering decreases, while the
longitudinal ponderomotive force gradually also reduces
the cycle-averaged longitudinal momentum ¯uz. Finally,
as the pulse completely overpasses the particle, the 3D
residual momentum

can be evaluated by neglecting transverse ponderomo-
tive eﬀects and pulse evolution during the slippage. It is
worth to note here that, while the (initial) cycle-averaged
momentum in Eq. 1 is used in e.g. envelope ionisation
models, the residual momenta of Eq. 2 can be employed,
in conjunction with the transverse residual position esti-
mate, to evaluate the minimum normalised emittance of
the extracted bunch, as in [29]. In this paper, the eﬀect
of the plasma wakeﬁeld either for the particle trapping
(see [30] for a detailed study) or beam emittance growth
due to the (possible) presence of non linear transverse
forces are not taken into account.

Theory from C. Schroeder et al. [29] also shows that,
in the optimal conditions of unsaturated ionization, the
newborn electrons are extracted in tiny slabs centered at
the maxima of the electric ﬁeld strength E = | (cid:126)E((cid:126)x, t)|.
For a given position, and after having deﬁned the phase of
E = E0| cos(ξ)| so as ξ = 0 corresponds to a given max-
imum of E, the analytical theory shows that the local
particle extraction phase ξe shows a Gaussian distribu-
tion around ξe = nπ, with n integer, and variance σξ (cid:39) ∆

[29] the phase extraction variance is
named σψ), where

beams are needed, however, higher pulse amplitudes are
used so as to extract more charge, therefore exploring
partially or even fully saturate regimes. There, a grad-
ual increase of the global normalised emittance is found
by simulations, as already pointed out in [29]. Our ana-
lytical theory that includes global saturation eﬀects con-
ﬁrms the emittance increase and very accurately ﬁts the
simulation results (see Sec. IVb). Moving with increas-
ingly higher amplitudes, we explore the saturation limit
within a single laser cycle. The phase space of the elec-
trons extracted in a single-cycle saturated regime (see
Sect. IIIb) reveals ﬁne structures that may help the un-
derstanding of either experiments [31, 32] or PIC simu-
lations [33] results when high intensity, very short pulses
are used. Our model for the phase-space reveals to be

extremely accurate in this regime, too (see Sect.
and predicts a reduction of a transverse momentum once
the fully saturated regime is reached. Very large pulse
amplitudes, however, may lead to switch-on multiple ion-
isation stages. In this work we also propose an accurate
model for this double-ionisation process (see Sect. IIIc).

II. SETTING UP THE PULSE AMPLITUDE
FOR TUNNEL IONIZATION

Here E0 is the ionization pulse strength, Ea (cid:39) 0.51T V /m
is the atomic ﬁeld strength, UH,I are the ionization po-
tentials of hydrogen and of the atomic selected level to
be ionized, respectively. Consequently, the rms residual
particle momentum σux = (cid:112)(cid:104)(ux)2(cid:105) along the ionization
pulse polarization is approximately a0∆. High-quality
electron bunches are obtained by minimizing the trans-
verse rms momentum and this is accomplished by a min-
imization of σξ, which should assume the lowest possible
value compatible with the possibility of extracting the
electrons from the selected atomic level of the dopant
atoms. As an example, N5+→6+
and Kr8+→9+
transitions are usually employed in ReMPI or Two-Color
schemes. The optimal values of ∆ (cid:39) σξ for those pro-
cesses are of about 0.29, 0.24 and 0.22, respectively (see
below).

, Ar8+→9+

The possibility of using very accurate predictors of the
rms normalised emittance along the polarisation axis
for either particles extracted in a single cycle or by the
whole laser pulse is of paramount importance for High-
Quality beam production studies. Moreover, as standard
requests refer to both high-charge and high-quality for
the beam, working points in a saturated or partially sat-
urated regime are often selected. Motivated by the needs
reported above, we recast the theory in [29] for the lo-
cal and global bunch parameters, so as to include all the
relevant terms of order ∆2, and to include additional ∆4
terms. In this work, we addressed the need of high ac-
curacy rms, predictors in the unsaturated regime, with
errors between analytical results and numerical simula-
tions below 1% (see Sects. IIIa and IVa). As high-charge

where ne is the number of extracted particles and n0,i
is the initial number of available ions, C depends of the
atom species and ionization level (there are some diﬀerent
versions for C e.g. Eq. 6 in [18]). The exponent µ in (4)
is deﬁned as

µ = −2n∗ + |m| + 1 ,

being n∗ = Z(cid:112)UH /UI and m the eﬀective principal
quantum number of the ion with ﬁnal charge Ze and the
projection of the angular momentum, respectively. The
peak normalised amplitude ρ0 = a0/ac is related to the
∆ term in [29] as ρ0 = ∆2. The evaluation of the number
of extracted electrons and spatial averages of σux will be
strongly simpliﬁed by expressing the average ionization

rate over a single ionization pulse cycle (cid:104)W (ρ0)(cid:105) as:

The choice of the optimal value for the normalised
ﬁeld amplitude ρ0 = ∆2 depends on several parame-
ters, including the number of extracted electrons, the ﬁ-
nal needed beam quality, ion density, pulse peak electric
ﬁeld and size. If a large number of electrons has to be
extracted, an optimal working point could be set so as
the laser pulse is close to its saturation limit, i.e. a large
fraction of the ions in the vicinity of the pulse axis are
ionized after the pulse passage. The solution of Eq. 4 for
a ionization depth L is ne(L) = ni,0(1 − e−¯Γ(L)) with

¯Γ(L) =

(cid:90) L

dz(cid:104)W (cid:105)/c .

(7)

Setting ¯Γ = 1 we get a ionization percentage of ≈ 60%,
therefore ¯Γ(L) ≈ 1 can be used to deﬁne the threshold
of saturation eﬀects. It is worth to deﬁne the local aver-
age spatial rate (cid:104)W (cid:105)/c as (cid:104)W (cid:105)/c ≡ ¯kADKρµ+1/2

We are now able to ﬁnd the normalised ﬁeld bringing to
a (≈ 60%) saturation in a longitudinal length L. For the
selected processes of Kr8+→9+
(m = 0),
(m = 0), the ¯kADK parameters evaluated
and N5+→6+
with Eq. 2 in [29] are 1.8 · 105µm−1, 1.4 · 105µm−1, 0.24 ·
105µm−1, respectively. For each ionization process and
saturation length L, normalised ﬁeld ρ0 = a0/ac reaching
saturation can be obtained by numerical solution of the

pendix.

III. ACCURATE RESIDUAL MOMENTUM
THEORY FOR A SINGLE CYCLE LASTING
IONIZATION

In this section we recast the theory for σux and improve
its accuracy by i) including a O(∆2) term not taken into
account in [29], ii) extending the theory up to O(∆4)
terms and, ﬁnally, iii) including (exponential) correction
terms due to the onset of saturation eﬀects. We will start
with local properties of the emitted electrons by neglect-
ing saturation eﬀects. Afterwards, we include the onset

3

of saturation contribution for σux . The new analytical re-
sults can therefore be included in envelope codes aiming
at an accurate statistical reconstruction of the ionization
process even at ionization pulse intensities close to the
single cycle saturation threshold (see below).

ing an approximated result including O(∆4) (i.e. O(ρ2

corrections for the latter, but neglecting ionization satu-
ration eﬀects. Following [29], we consider a single half-
cycle of the ionization pulse Ex(ξ) = E0,x cos ξ, extract-
ing electrons with phases ξ = k0(z − ct) around the ﬁeld
maximum at ξ = 0. Expressing the ionization rate W (ξ)
in terms of the extraction phase, we get

The expansion of the exponential factor in Eq. 10 in

in our regimes. Here, terms containing ξ4/ρ0 are re-
tained as they are O(∆2) and this is related to the dif-
ference of our results from the equivalent terms in [29]
(see below). From now on, we will use W (ξ) in the

the pulse amplitude a0 for the local extraction of particles

is able to reproduce the Monte Carlo simulations results

B. Local, single channel, ionisation process
including saturation eﬀects

Local saturation eﬀects may be important when they
occur within a single pulse cycle (see Fig. 12). In this
case, due to the monotonic reduction of the available ions
as the pulse proceeds crossing each ﬁeld peak, an asym-
metry of the extraction average phase occurs, thus induc-
ing a deviation of the rms value for ux (see below) from
the unsaturated case and the occurrence of a nonzero
average momentum along the polarization axis. In this
subsection we explore the local ionisation process occur-
ring in a single channel, (e.g Ar8+→9+
), while multiple
ionisation processes activated by the very large electric
ﬁeld will be discussed in the next subsection.

The statistical local weight of Eq. 18 is now employed

number of extracted electrons in the ﬁrst half cycle as

distribution of the extraction phase can strongly deviate
from a Gaussian one once νs (cid:38) 1, as the extraction phase
can be modeled with a probability P (ξ) (cid:118) dn/dξ by us-
ing Eq. 18. To simplify the model, it is useful to work
with a randomly distributed variable x ∈ [−xmax, xmax]

(21)

where the sign of (cid:104)ξe(cid:105)single depends of the phase of the
ﬁeld peak. The second moment of the extraction phases
can be evaluated in a similar way, obtaining

(cid:104)ξ2

e (cid:105)single (cid:39) 2ρ0 × Ξ(2, ρ0) .

(22)

The moments Ξ(n, ρ0) for n = 1 − 4, as a function of
the saturation parameter νs and the ionisation process
Ar8+→9+
with λ0 = 0.4 µm are shown in Fig. 3. As a
ﬁnal result, in the case of partial or full saturation, the
single peak distribution of the extraction phases around
the local ﬁeld maximum follows a strongly non Gaussian
distribution of the shape as Eq. 19, with x = ξe/
2ρ0
and an ionisation fraction of (1 − e−νs). The resulting
ﬁrst and second order moments of the extraction phases
follow Eqs. 21 and 22.

√

Once the extraction phases have been statistically de-
scribed, the resulting distribution of the residual trans-
verse momenta is ﬁnally obtained (once again after ne-
glecting ponderomotive force eﬀects) by evaluating the
particle momenta as ue = −a0 sin(ξe). As the ﬁrst peak
ionises a fraction of the (1 − e−νs) available ions, the re-
maining e−νs(1 − e−νs ) are extracted by the second peak
of the cycle. There, as sin(ξe) changes its sign, a reversed

distribution of the momenta with respect to the ﬁrst peak

It is interesting to note that a slight asymmetry and
therefore a visible deviation from a Gaussian distribu-
tion occurs even at pulse amplitudes corresponding to
(or close to) working points used in High-Quality beam

accurately describes the process as it matches both the
Monte Carlo and PIC simulations, while the standard
Gaussian distribution partially deviates from the other
distributions. Moving into the deep-saturation territory,

FIG. 5. Deep saturation distribution of ue for the electrons

processes (a0 = 0.6,
λ0 = 0.4µm corresponding to νs = 9.52). Orange bars refer
to the distribution obtained with the model of Eq. 19 (ﬁrst
peak of the cycle where more than 99.99% of the available ions
have been ionised). The blue bars are perfectly superimposed
with the orange bars and show the distribution obtained by
a Monte-Carlo simulation. The green bars (not visible here
due to the very few particles extracted there) show the dis-
tribution of the electrons extracted by the second peak of the
cycle. The red line refers to the full-cycle electron distribu-
tion obtained by simulations without saturations eﬀects, for
reference.

very large deviations from the standard Gaussian distri-
bution are observed. Figure 5 compares the momenta
distribution of the extracted electrons extracted in the
case of deep saturation (νs = 9.52 (cid:29) 1) for the Ar8+→9+
process (a0 = 0.6, λ0 = 0.4µm). After the half pulse
passage, about 99.998% of the ions have been ionised

The analytical estimation of the cycle averaged mean
and rms momentum ux including saturation eﬀects pro-
ceeds by observing that the cycle averaged sinus of the ex-
traction phase can be evaluated averaging the contributes

The overall saturation correction slightly increases above
unity in the range 0 (cid:46) νs (cid:46) 1 (see the black line in
Fig. 3).
In this range, both the peaks in each pulse
contribute in extracting particles with opposite average
momenta, thus inducing an increase of the rms full cy-
cle transverse momentum. In the deep saturation regime
(νs (cid:38) 1) the second peak gives even more negligible con-
tribution while the single peak rms momenta decrease
due to the phase space cut induced by the strong satu-
ration, with the ﬁnal result of generating an overall rms
momentum well below the one expected without satura-
tion eﬀects on. The ﬁnal results for the cycle averaged
ﬁrst and second order moments of the residual momenta
in the case of the single process Ar8+→9+
are shown in
Fig. 6. As we clearly see in Fig. 6-b), if λ0 = 0.4 µm the
maximum rms momentum is achieved with a0 ≈ 0.53.
We stress that those results are obtained by activating
the single ionisation channel described above.

C. Single-cycle, multiple channel ionisation
processes

In the single-cycle intermediate and deep saturation
regimes, the pulse electric ﬁeld is usually large enough
to activate one (or more) ionisation channel(s) above the
starting, selected one. Referring to the usual Argon ex-
ample, when νs (cid:38) 1 a two-channels process related to the
(l = 1, m = 0) Ar8+→9+
, Ar9+→10+
occurs, with the next
process Ar10+→11+
(m = 1) having a statistical weight
signiﬁcantly lower than the others. The analysis reported
in the previous subsection can be applied on the single
channels, thus giving insight into the whole ionisation
process. To start with, we denote with the subscripts (0)
and (1) the base (selected) process and the subsequent
one, respectively, and with n(0)
their initial available
ions.

, respectively. Panel a)
depicts the residual transverse momentum distribution along
the polarisation axis x, while in panel b) the longitudinal
residual momentum uz is shown. Since ponderomotive forces
are not taken into account, the residual momentum along y
is zero (not shown here). As it is clear from the sum of the
(0, 1) channels (red line), the model is capable to well repro-
duce the single-cycle momenta distribution even in a multi-
channel regime.

Equations 27 very accurately predict the number of ex-
tracted electrons in any channel in a a single pulse peak,
being the maximum discrepancy between the inferred
number of extracted electrons and Monte Carlo simu-
lations outcomes below 1% ≈ ρ2

0 (see Fig. 8)

The distribution of the extracted electrons in the chan-
nel (0) follows the already discussed prescriptions from
Eq. 19. The distribution from process (1) takes origin
both from the ions initially available at level (1) and those
that are freed while the phase proceeds within the peak.

simulations, respectively.

In Fig.

momentum as predicted by the single Ar8+→9+

shows that the second ionisation step induces a sensible
reduction of the average momentum as a large ionisation
of the (0) level in the ﬁrst ﬁrst peak causes an increase of
the number of particles extracted in level (1) during the
second peak, where sin(ξe) has an opposite sign. Further-
more, in Fig. 9-b) we can also note that the additional
(1) level rules out the momentum drop oﬀ induced by
saturation in the single (0) process. As a matter of fact,

The two-levels model for the whole process occurring
in a single peak, including the estimates of the extracted
particles via Eq. 27 and extraction phase distributions
following the base level distribution Eq. 19 and 29, can
be combined so as to get the whole (0) + (1) process
(e.g. Ar8+→10+
) in a full pulse cycle. Figure 9 shows the
full-cycle scan of the average and rms momentum for
the two-levels process Ar8+→10+
with λ0 = 0.4 µm, as
a function of pulse amplitude a0. The model prediction
(blue diamonds) agree with Monte Carlo simulations (red

average momentum (box a) and for the rms momentum
(box b). The black line from the right axis in a) shows
the fraction of the second ionisation process (1) over the

ingly well with predictions by the theory of unsaturated
ionisation by the single (0) process (see also the blue line

IV. WHOLE BUNCH EMITTANCE THEORY

As the cycle pulse amplitude depends on both the lon-
gitudinal and transverse coordinate, we make the sub-
stitution a0 → f ((cid:126)x)a0, being f the laser pulse envelope
shape. As a result, for any position (cid:126)x the statistical av-
erage weight of the extracted electrons Eq. 6, as well as
their rms transverse momentum, depend on (cid:126)x trough f .
We move on by ﬁrstly neglecting saturation eﬀects (see
Fig. 12) and ponderomotive force eﬀects.

A. Theory with negligible saturation eﬀects

The description of the spatial dependence of σux . and
subsequent evaluation of the whole beam emittance, can
be simpliﬁed by introducing the generating functional of
the spatial moments:

G(m, n) ≡ (cid:104)e−mr2−n(z−ct)2

(cid:105)

=

(cid:82) d3xe−mr2−n(z−ct)2

dne/dt((cid:126)x)

(cid:82) d3xdne/dt((cid:126)x)

,

(31)

where dne/cdt = (cid:104)W (cid:105) has been used in absence of sat-
uration eﬀects (see Eq. 6) and ρ = ρ0f includes the
pulse envelope f eﬀects. If the pulse envelope gas a bi-

The longitudinal counterpart of Eq. 33, i.e. G(0, k) ≡
(cid:105), can be evaluate in a similar way. We

The diﬀerence with the equivalent result in [29] (see Eq.

the nitrogen) is usually large.
cal results of Eq. 38 (dashed lines) are compared with
simulations which exclude either saturation of the ioniza-
tion process and ponderomotive force eﬀects in the sub-
sequent electron dynamics inside the laser ﬁeld. In this
case, errors below 1% are expected when evaluating the
full bunch rms momentum along the laser polarisation
axis.

The functional generator of the moments G(m, n) can
be employed, of course, to evaluate the rms values of the
transverse and longitudinal bunch size, too. This can
be accomplished by observing that, for any slice at ﬁxed
z − ct, the rms extraction radius can be evaluated as

(cid:104)r2(cid:105) = −∂mG(m, 0)m=0 .

(39)

The gradient ∂mG(m, 0) can be obtained either in an ex-
act form by using the complete version of I(k, ρ0) as in

10

with simulations relative to low values of ρ0. Further-
more, we also note that the model ﬁts (with unsaturated
working points) with simulations including ponderomo-
tive force eﬀects, as those eﬀects don’t increase the beam
emittance (at least at the leading order) [29].

En. Here black points
represent simulation results of simulations including pon-
deromotive force eﬀects, while red points refer to simulations
withoutv ponderomotive force eﬀects on. Diamond and circle
points represent simulation results for krypton and argon, re-
spectively, which include saturation eﬀects during ionization
but exclude the ponderomotive force contribution in the sub-
sequent particles evolution. The dashed lines show, for the
same processes, the analytical results with excludes satura-
tion eﬀects. Thick lines show the analytical results with a full
description of the ionization process.

The onset of ionization saturation during the whole
pulse passage usually occurs at pulse amplitudes close to
those selected as working points, i.e.
lower than those
necessary to get saturation eﬀects within a single pulse
peak. A ﬁrst eﬀect is the reduction of the number of
particles extracted in the vicinity of the pulse axis, thus
enhancing the statistical weight of the regions with r (cid:119)
∆0w0 and therefore increasing the ﬁnal (cid:104)r2(cid:105)bunch. As
a result, the rms residual momentum is slightly smaller
than that expected without saturation eﬀects on. We will
see however that, as anticipated in [29] the ﬁnal eﬀect is
that of a whole-bunch emittance increase, being the ﬁnal
result dominated by the increase of the bunch radius,
indeed.

Although the results from Eq. 49 are strictly valid for
¯νs (cid:28) 1, they look very accurate also for ¯νs (cid:46) 2.5, where
a fraction of 1−e−¯νs (cid:39) 90% of the ions lying on the pulse
axis will be further ionised (see Fig. 11). Inspection of
the saturation corrections with larger saturation param-
eters could be operated either by using results from Eq.
32 or by using numerical integration of Eq. 46.

V. SUMMARY

We reported on a comprehensive analysis of the 3D
phase-space of the particles extracted via tunnelling ion-
isation by a single,
linearly polarised, Gaussian laser
pulse.
Results concerning a single-cycle averaging,
showed that the model distribution of Eq. 19 very ac-
curately described the distribution of the momenta for a
single ionisation process (e.g. Kr8+→9+
). We ﬁrstly re-
ported an estimate of the rms residual momentum for the
electrons extracted in a single pulse cycle. Such an esti-
mate, valid in the limit of unsaturated ionisation, had ac-
curacy O(ρ2
0), i.e. O(∆4) using notation of [29], is linked
to the presence of non-Gaussian terms in the extraction
phase ξe distribution (see the last raw in Eq. 10). As
the pulse amplitude increases approaching the saturation
limit, the analysis of such a momenta distribution reveals
the appearance of non-null average momentum along the
single pulse peaks and a decrease of the cycle rms mo-
mentum in the saturation regime. The extension of the
model up two ionisation processes (e.g. Kr8+→10+
, see
also Eq. 26 and subsequent equations in the subsection),
together with Eq. 1 gives us the possibility to predict
with unprecedented accuracy the whole ionisation pro-
cess occurring in a single pulse cycle. This oﬀers either a
new perspective to analyse and prepare experiments with
few-cycle pulses or a very accurate basis to simulate the
cycle-averaged phase space of the extracted particles in
fast codes using the envelope approximation.

As a second outcome, we obtained a very accurate
estimate of the whole bunch emittance, i.e.
the nor-
malised emittance along the polarisation axis of the elec-
tron bunch just after the pulse passage (see Eqs. 42 and
43 for the unsaturated case and Eqs. 48 and 49 for the
saturated case). Our results for the whole bunch con-
ﬁrmed the emittance increase in the saturation regime as
ﬁrstly reported in [29], improving the results shown there
by giving analytical estimates of the rms transverse size
increase and rms momentum slight decrease due to sat-
uration eﬀects.

The accuracy of the results reported in the manuscript
has been checked either via full-PIC simulations or with
ad-hoc Monte Carlo codes, showing a remarkable high
accuracy (with errors below 1%) of the analytical out-
comes in the fully-saturated regimes explored in the text.
Our results, however, do not include the eﬀect of the
plasma wakeﬁeld where the extracted particles would be
trapped. Also, transverse ponderomotive eﬀects have not
been taken into account in the analytical results concern-

ing the transverse momentum and position separately,
though their combination through the normalised emit-
tance is not aﬀected by the (leading term) radially linear
ponderomotive force, as conﬁrmed by our simulations.

APPENDIX

A. Optimal working point for the ionisation
process

FIG. 12. Scale-length in µm for ionization saturation as a
function of the normalised ﬁeld strength ρ0 = a0/ac and for
the Kr8+→9+
, (m = 0) (green line), Ar8+→9+
, (m = 0) (or-
ange line) and N5+→6+
, (m = 0) (light blue line) processes.
The horizontal lines show the saturation point in a single cy-
cle, while the black lines are related to long pulses of length
cT . The red markers show the working points bringing to
saturation with pulses having longitudinal size of about 5µm.

In the special case of a single or few cycle pulse
(see [32, 38] for recent applications to the ionization
injection [39]), a key parameter is the normalised ﬁeld
strength bringing to saturation into a single pulse cy-
cle.
in the usual
case of a long laser pulse (cT (cid:29) λ0), following Eq. 5
in [29], we expect a longitudinal ionization length of
L (cid:39) ∆cT = ρ1/2
0 cT . We can visualize solutions of Eq. 9
by means of Fig. 12, where the ionization scale-lengths

In this case L ≈ λ0. However,

K(ρ0) = [¯kADKρµ+1/2
e−1/ρ0]−1 and ionization lengths
L(ρ0) are shown as a function of the normalised ﬁeld
strength ρ0.

0

For each process, the working point is found as the
intersection of the K and L curves in Fig. 12. There we
show the working points realising saturation in a single
wavelength for the cases λ0 = 0.2 − 0.8 µm (horizontal
lines) or saturation for a long pulse having length in the
range 5−15 µm (black lines). Finally, the red marks show
the selected working points for pulses of length of about
cT = 5 µm. Inspection of Fig. 12 shows that the interval
of normalised ﬁeld strengths of interest is very tiny. For
krypton, the value of ρ0 = 0.052 is enough to fully ionise
the available ions within a single cycle with λ0 = 0.2 µm.
For a very long pulse with cT = 15 µm, however, ions are
close to saturation with ρ0 = 0.045. Similarly, the ﬁeld
amplitudes range for argon and nitrogen are 0.055−0.065
and 0.078 − 0.102, respectively.

Set-up for the PIC simulations of single-cycle
ionization

We report here the set-up of the PIC simulations with
the code Smilei [27, 40] used to obtain Figs. 6, 7 . For
these simulations the azimuthal decomposition technique
in cylindrical geometry has been used, with 2 azimuthal
modes [41–43]. The longitudinal and radial resolutions
are ∆z = 0.003125 µm and ∆r = 0.1 µm respectively,
the integration timestep ∆t = 0.99 ∆z/c. A laser pulse
with Gaussian envelope and temporal proﬁle propagating
in the z direction is initialized in the simulation domain
using the electromagnetic ﬁelds expressions in [44], mul-
tiplied by the appropriate gaussian temporal envelope.
The laser pulse, with carrier wavelength λ0 = 0.4 µm
and polarized in the x direction, has a waist w0 = 10
µm and FWHM duration in intensity TF W HM,d = 10 fs,
with a0 taking the values for the respective simulations
shown in the mentioned Figures. The cylindrical plasma
target, composed of already ionized Ar8+ and the neu-
tralizing electrons obtained through ionization of the ﬁrst
8 levels, has uniform atomic density of 1020 cm−3, length
Ltarget = 6∆z and radius Rtarget = 8∆r. Each species
(ions and neutralizing electrons) of the target is sampled
with nz ·nr ·nθ = 256 macro-particles per cell, distributed
regularly with [nz = 4, nr = 4, nθ = 16] particles along
the z,r directions and in the 2π azimuthal angle respec-
tively. The laser pulse is initialized with CEP phase π/2,
i.e. with a zero-value of the transverse electric ﬁeld in
the center of the laser pulse. At t = 0, the pulse peak is
positioned at the center of the target, to reproduce the
underlying assumptions of the derivations. The ioniza-
tion procedure implemented in the code uses the ADK
ionization rate formula as reported in [29]. The residual
parameters of the electrons obtained through ionization
are computed after the laser pulse has left the target.

Monte Carlo simulation

Monte Carlo simulations used the rate equations Eqs.4
to extract particles, where the local normalised ﬁeld
strength ρ = ρ0f included pulse envelope eﬀects through
a Gaussian proﬁle f (r, z − ct) = exp(−r2/w2
0 − (z −
ct)2/L2). As the particles have been extracted, the phase
extraction ξe was collected and the residual momentum
ux = −(a0f ) sin(ξe) determined along with the extrac-
tion transverse position x. The evaluation of the resid-
ual momentum along the polarisation axis and the par-

ticle transverse position doesn’t take into account the
transverse ponderomotive force and we referred in the
text those simulations as ”without ponderomotive force
eﬀects”. A Monte-Carlo including the full electron dy-
including pondero-
namics after particle extraction, i.e.
motive force eﬀects has also been used.
In both the
cases, very large temporal resolution has been employed
(c∆t = λ0/150) so as to accurately describe both the ion-
isation process and, in the second case, the subsequent
particle quivering.
