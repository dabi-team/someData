From superdeformation to extreme deformation and clusterization in the N ∼ Z nuclei
of the A ∼ 40 mass region.

(Dated: October 10, 2018)

A systematic search for extremely deformed structures in the N ∼ Z nuclei of the A ∼ 40
mass region has been performed for the ﬁrst time in the framework of covariant density functional
theory. At spin zero such structures are located at high excitation energies which prevents their
experimental observation. The rotation acts as a tool to bring these exotic shapes to the yrast line or
its vicinity so that their observation could become possible with future generation of γ−tracking (or
similar) detectors such as GRETA and AGATA. The major physical observables of such structures
(such as transition quadrupole moments as well as kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia),
the underlying single-particle structure and the spins at which they become yrast or near yrast
are deﬁned. The search for the ﬁngerprints of clusterization and molecular structures is performed
and the conﬁgurations with such features are discussed. The best candidates for observation of
extremely deformed structures are identiﬁed. For several nuclei in this study (such as 36Ar), the
addition of several spin units above currently measured maximum spin of 16~ will inevitably trigger
the transition to hyper- and megadeformed nuclear shapes.

INTRODUCTION

There is a considerable interest to the study of cluster
structures and extremely deformed shapes in light nuclei
[1–10]. Many of these structures are described in terms
of clusters, the simplest one being the α-particle [2, 3].
Providing a unique insight on the cluster dynamics inside
of nucleus, the initial assumptions about clusters repre-
sent a limitation of this type of models. Note also that
many shell model conﬁgurations are beyond the reach
It is also important to remem-
of the cluster models.
ber that the cluster description does not correspond to
clearly separated α-particles, but generates the mean-
ﬁeld states largely by antisymmetrization [3].
In addi-
tion, the studies of molecular structures, which appear
in many extremely deformed conﬁgurations, have gained
considerable interest [2, 7, 11].

In recent years, the investigations of exotic cluster con-
ﬁgurations have been undertaken also in the density func-
tional theory (DFT). The advantage of the DFT frame-
work is the fact that it does not assume the existence of
cluster structures; the formation of cluster structures pro-
ceeds from microscopic single-nucleon degrees of freedom
via many-body correlations [6, 12]. As a result, the DFT
framework allows simultaneous treatment of cluster and
mean-ﬁeld-type states [5, 6, 12–14].
It is important to
mention that covariant (relativistic) energy density func-
tionals (CEDFs) show more pronounced clusterization of
the density distribution as compared with non-relativistic
ones because of deeper single-nucleon potentials [6].

Let us mention some recent studies of cluster and ex-
tremely deformed structures in the DFT framework. The
clustering phenomenon in light stable and exotic nuclei
was studied within the relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF) ap-
proach in Ref. [15] and within the Hartree-Fock (HF)
approach based on the Skyrme energy density function-

als (EDF) in Ref. [5]. Linear chain conﬁgurations of four
α-clusters in 16O and the relationship between the sta-
bility of such states and angular momentum were investi-
gated using Skyrme cranked HF method in Ref. [16] and
cranked RMF (further CRMF) in Ref. [14]. This is an
example of the “rod shaped” nucleus. Another case of
such structures is linear chain of three α clusters, sug-
gested about 60 years ago [17]; it was recently studied
in the CRMF theory in Ref. [8]. This exotic structure
(“Hoyle” state) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of
12C from three 4He nuclei in stars [18]. The stability
of rod-shaped structures in highly-excited states of 24Mg
was studied in Ref. [9] in cranked Skyrme HF calcula-
tions.

The diﬃculty in investigating cluster and extremely
deformed states is that they are generally unbound and
lie at high excitation energies at low spins [2, 10]. More-
over, they are either formed on the shoulder or in very
shallow minima of potential energy surfaces [12, 19]; thus,
they are inherently unstable at low spin. The high den-
sity of nucleonic conﬁgurations at these energies and pos-
sible mixing among them is another factor hindering their
observation with current and future generations of ex-
perimental facilities. Moreover, obtaining unambiguous
evidences for clustering (such as a transition strengths
between diﬀerent states and the structure of the wave-
function) is equally challenging and frequently ambigu-
In addition, the

mechanisms of the reactions used in experimental stud-
ies frequently favor the population of yrast or near-yrast
states [10].

The rotation of the nucleus could help to overcome
these problems in experimental observation of extremely
deformed structures. Two factors are contributing to
that. First, very large deformation conﬁgurations (such
as super- (SD), hyper- (HD) and megadeformed (MD)

energy versus spin plots, see Sec. 4.1 in Ref. [20] for details. Diﬀerent types of conﬁgurations are shown by diﬀerent types of

ones) are favored by rotation at high spins (see, for ex-
ample, the discussion in Refs. [19, 21]). Second, normal-
and highly-deformed conﬁgurations, which are forming
yrast or near-yrast structures at low and medium spins,
have limited angular momentum content. As a conse-
quence, only extreme deformation structures (SD, HD,
or MD) could be populated above some speciﬁc spin val-
ues in the nuclei of the interest.

Our systematic search for extremely deformed conﬁg-
urations is focused on the N = Z and N = Z + 2
even-even S (Z = 16), Ar (Z = 18), Ca (Z = 40), Ti
(Z = 42), Cr (Z = 44) (and also on N = Z + 4 44Ca)
and odd-odd N = Z = 21 42Sc nuclei. The selection
of the nuclei is motivated by several factors. First, the
40Ca nucleus is a centerpiece of this study because of its
highly unusual features. This is doubly magic spherical
nucleus (in the ground state) in which normal- and su-
perdeformed conﬁgurations based on the 4 particle - 4
hole (4p-4h) and 8 particle - 8 hole (8p-8h) excitations,
respectively, are observed at low excitation energies (Ref.
[22]). Two-dimensional alpha cluster model predicts very
exotic and highly-deformed conﬁgurations in this nucleus

[23]. Second, in this mass region the superdeformation
has already been observed in the 40Ca ([22, 24]), 36Ar
([25, 26]), 35Cl ([27]), 40Ar ([28]) and probably 28Si [29]
nuclei. Moreover, the SD bands have been seen up to
very high spin of I = 16~ in some of these nuclei. This
is quite important fact because according to the results
obtained in the present paper further modest increase
of the spin could lead to the population of extremely de-
formed structures in some of the nuclei. When populated
such structures could be observed with the next gener-
ation of the γ-tracking detectors such as GRETA and
AGATA. In addition, the resonance observed at I ∼ 36~
in the 24Mg+24Mg reaction strongly supports the HD
shape for a compound 48Cr nucleus formed in this reac-
tion [30]. Moreover, the analysis of light particle energy
spectra and angular correlations in the framework of the
statistical model indicates the onset of large deformations
at high spin in 44Ti [31]. Third, in experiment the high
spin structures in this mass region are better populated
in the N ∼ Z nuclei. Note also that at present high spin
studies are quite active in this mass region [30, 32–35].

There are theoretical studies of deformed structures

in these nuclei but they either focus on SD structures
at high spin or are limited to a shape coexistence at
low spin. For example, positive-parity states of 40Ca
were studied in Ref. [4] using antisymmetrized molecular
dynamics (AMD) and the generator coordinate method
(GCM); this is basically alpha-clustering model. The co-

existence of low-spin normal- and superdeformed states
in 32S, 36Ar, 38Ar and 40Ca has been studied in the GCM
based on the Skyrme SLy6 functional in Ref. [36]. The
SD and HD rotational bands in the N = Z S, Ar, Ca, Ti
and Cr nuclei have also been studied in cranked Hartree-
Fock (CHF) approach based on the Skyrme forces in
Refs. [37, 38]. A special attention has been paid to the
SD structures in 32S which were studied in detail in the
CHF frameworks based on Skyrme [37, 39] and Gogny
[40] forces and cranked relativistic mean ﬁeld (CRMF)
theory [41]. Exotic and highly-deformed α-cluster con-
ﬁgurations have been predicted long time ago in two-
dimensional α-cluster model in 4N nuclei from 12C to
44Ti in Ref. [23]. The investigation of superdeforma-
tion and clustering in these nuclei still remains an ac-
tive ﬁeld of research within the cluster models (see Refs.
[1, 3, 4, 7, 42]).

There are several goals behind this study. First, it
is imperative to understand at which spins extremely
deformed conﬁgurations are expected to become yrast
(or come close to the vicinity of the yrast line) and to
ﬁnd the best candidates for experimental studies of such
structures. This requires detailed knowledge of termi-
nating conﬁgurations up to their terminating states since
they form the yrast line at low and medium spins. How-
ever, the tracing of terminating conﬁgurations from low
spin up to their terminating states is non-trivial prob-
lem in density functional theories (see Sec. 8 in Ref. [43]
and Ref. [44]). To our knowledge, such calculations have
been done so far only in few nuclei: 20Ne (in the cranked
Skyrme HF [45] and CRMF [46, 47] frameworks), 48Cr
(in the HFB framework with Gogny forces [48]) and 109Sb
(in the CRMF framework [43]). Note also that in 109Sb
they fail to reach the terminating state. With appropri-
ate improvements in the CRMF computer code we are
able to perform such calculations for the majority of the
conﬁgurations forming the yrast line at low and medium
spins. Second, the basic properties (such as transition
quadrupole moments, dynamic and kinematic moments
of inertia) of the conﬁgurations of interest, which could
be compared in future with experimental data, are pre-
dicted. Third, we search for the ﬁngerprints of the clus-
terization and molecular structures via a detailed analy-
sis of the density distributions of the conﬁgurations under
study.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the details of the solutions of the cranked relativistic
mean ﬁeld equations. Detailed analysis of the structure of
rotational spectra of 40Ca and 42Sc is presented in Secs.
III and IV, respectively. A special attention is paid to
the dependence of density distributions on the conﬁgura-
tion. The general features of rotational spectra along the
yrast line are discussed in Sec. V. Section VI is devoted
to the discussion of the appearance of super-, hyper- and
megadeformed conﬁgurations along the yrast line of the
32,34S, 36,38Ar, 42,44Ca, 44,46Ti and 48,50Cr nuclei and
their properties. The conﬁgurations which reveal the

II. THE DETAILS OF THE THEORETICAL
CALCULATIONS

In the relativistic mean-ﬁeld (RMF) theory the nu-
cleus is described as a system of pointlike nucleons,
Dirac spinors, coupled to mesons and to the photons
[43, 49, 50]. The nucleons interact by the exchange of
several mesons, namely a scalar meson σ and three vec-
tor particles, ω, ρ and the photon. The CRMF theory
[46, 51, 52] is the extension of the RMF theory to the
rotating frame in one-dimensional cranking approxima-
tion.
It represents the realization of covariant density
functional theory (CDFT) for rotating nuclei with no
pairing correlations [43]. It has successfully been tested
in a systematic way on the properties of diﬀerent types
of rotational bands in the regime of weak pairing such
as normal-deformed [53], superdeformed [52, 54], as well
as smooth terminating bands [43] and the bands at the
extremes of angular momentum [55].

The formalism and the applications of the CRMF the-
ory to the description of rotating nuclei have recently
been reviewed in Ref. [56] (see also Refs. [43, 57]). A
clear advantage of the CRMF framework for the descrip-
tion of rotating nuclei is the treatment of time-odd mean
ﬁelds which are uniquely deﬁned via the Lorentz covari-
ance [58]; note that these ﬁelds substantially aﬀect the
properties of rotating nuclei [47, 59]. Because the details
of the CRMF framework could be found in earlier publi-
cations (Refs. [19, 46, 51, 52, 60]), we focus here on the
features typical for the present study.

The pairing correlations are neglected in the present
calculations. There are several reasons behind this
choice. First, it is well known that pairing correlations
are quenched by rotation (Coriolis anti-pairing eﬀect)
[61, 62]. The presence of substantial shell gaps also
leads to a quenching of pairing correlations [63]. An-
other mechanism of pairing quenching is blocking eﬀect
which is active in many nucleonic conﬁgurations [61]. In
a given conﬁguration, the pairing is also very weak at
the spins close to band termination [20]. Moreover, the
pairing drastically decreases after paired band crossings
in the proton and neutron subsystems [53]; at these spins
the results of the calculations with and without pairing
are very similar.

FIG. 5. (Color online) Calculated transition quadrupole mo-
ments Qt and γ-deformations of the yrast and excited SD and
HD conﬁgurations in 40Ca. The colors of the lines for diﬀer-
ent types of conﬁgurations roughly correspond to those used
in Fig. 1. Red and orange (black and dark brown) are used
for the SD (HD) conﬁgurations.

Second, the calculations for blocked conﬁgurations
within the
cranked Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov
(CRHB) framework [64] are frequently numerically un-
stable [57]. This is a common problem for self-consistent
Hartree-Bogoliubov or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calcu-
lations which appears both in relativistic and non-
relativistic frameworks [65]. On the contrary, these prob-
lems are much less frequent in unpaired CRMF calcula-
tions (see Ref. [19]). Even then it is not always possi-
ble to trace the conﬁguration in the desired spin range.
This typically takes place when (i) the local minimum
is not deep enough for the solution (unconstrained in
quadrupole moments) to stay in it during convergence
process and (ii) occupied and unoccupied single-particle
orbitals with the same quantum numbers come close in
energy and start to interact.

Based on previous experience in 40Ca (Ref. [22]), 48Cr
(Ref. [20]) and somewhat heavier N ∼ Z A = 58 − 80 nu-
clei (Refs. [53, 54]), we estimate that the pairing becomes

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quite small and thus not very important above I ∼ 10~
in the nuclei of interest. This is exactly the spin range on
which the current study is focused. Note also that the
comparison of the CRHB and CRMF results for a few
conﬁgurations in 40Ca presented at the end of Sect. III
supports this conclusion.

In the current study, we restrict ourselves to reﬂec-
tion symmetric shapes since previous calculations in the
cranked Hartree-Fock approach with Skyrme forces [38]
showed that odd-multipole (octupole, . . .) deformations
play a very limited role in extremely deformed conﬁgu-
rations of the mass region under study.

The CRMF equations are solved in the basis of
an anisotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in
Cartesian coordinates characterized by the deformation
parameters β0 and γ and oscillator frequency ~ω0 =
41A1/3 MeV, for details see Refs. [46, 52]. The trun-
cation of basis is performed in such a way that all states
belonging to the major shells up to NF = 14 fermionic
shells for the Dirac spinors and up to NB = 20 bosonic
shells for the meson ﬁelds are taken into account. This
truncation scheme provides suﬃcient numerical accuracy
(see Ref. [19] for details).

The CRMF calculations have been performed with
the NL3* functional [66] which is state-of-the-art func-
tional for nonlinear meson-nucleon coupling model [67].
It is globally tested for ground state observables in even-
even nuclei [67] and systematically tested for physical

5

observables related to excited states in heavy nuclei
[57, 68, 69]. The CRMF and CRHB calculations with
the NL3* CEDF provide a very successful description of
diﬀerent types of rotational bands [55, 57, 66] both at
low and high spins.

The quadrupole deformation β2 is deﬁned in self-
consistent calculations from calculated quadrupole mo-
ments using the simple relation [70–72]

neutron (X = N ) subsystem or represents total nuclear
system (X = A). However this expression neglects the
higher powers of β2 and higher multipolarity deforma-
tions β4, β6,...
[73], which have an important role at
very large deformations.

FIG. 7. (Color online) The same as Fig. 5 but for the MD
conﬁgurations in 40Ca.

Because the deﬁnition of the deformation is model de-
pendent [73] and deformation parameters are not exper-
imentally measurable quantities, we prefer to use transi-
tion quadrupole moment Qt for the description of defor-
mation properties of the SD, HD and MD bands. This
is an experimentally measurable quantity and thus in fu-
ture our predictions can be directly compared with the
experimental results. The deformation properties of the
yrast SD band in 40Ca [22] are used as a reference. The

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
t = 1.8+0.35

measured transition quadrupole moment of this band is
Qexp
−0.29 eb [22]. Note that the CRMF calcula-
tions with the NL3* functional come close to experiment
only slightly overestimating an experimental value (see
Fig. 5 below). Thus we use Qexp
t = 1.8 eb in 40Ca as a
reference point. Note that the SD band in 40Ca is the
most deformed SD band among observed SD bands in
this mass region.

Using this value we introduce the normalized transition

quadrupole moment Qnorm

t

(Z, A) in the (Z, A) system

(2)

This is similar to what has been done in Ref.
[19]
in the analysis of the HD conﬁgurations in medium
mass region.
This equation is based on the ratio
(Z, A)/Qt(40Ca) calculated using Eq. (1) under
Qnorm
t
the assumption that the β2 values in the (Z, A) system
and in 40Ca are the same.

t

The band will be described as HD if its calculated Qt
value exceeds Qnorm
(Z, A) by approximately 50%. This
deﬁnition of HD is similar to the one employed in Ref.
[19]. Following suggestion of Ref. [21], we describe even
more deformed bands as megadeformed. The band is
classiﬁed as MD when its calculated Qt value is approx-
imately twice of Qnorm

(Z, A) or higher.

t

Single-particle orbitals are labeled by Ω[N nzΛ](r =
±i). Ω[N nzΛ] are the asymptotic quantum numbers
(Nilsson quantum numbers) of the dominant component
of the wave function at Ωx = 0.0 MeV and r is the sig-
nature of the orbital.

Because the pairing correlations are neglected, the in-
trinsic structure of the conﬁgurations of interest can
be described by means of the dominant single-particle
components of the intruder/hyperintruder/megaintruder
states occupied. Thus, the calculated conﬁgurations will
be labeled by shorthand [n1(n2)(n3),p1(p2)(p3)] labels,
where n1, n2 and n3 are the number of neutrons in the
N = 3, 4 and 5 intruder/hyperintruder/megaintruder or-
bitals and p1, p2 and p3 are the number of protons in the
N = 3, 4 and 5 intruder/hyperintruder/megaintruder or-
bitals. The N = 5 megaintruder orbitals are not occu-
pied in the HD conﬁgurations. As a consequence, the
labels n3 and p3 will be omitted in the labeling of such
conﬁgurations. Moreover, the N = 4 and N = 5 or-
bitals are not occupied in the SD conﬁgurations. So,
in those conﬁgurations the n2, n3 and p2, p3 labels will
be omitted. An additional letter (a,b,c,
at the
end of the shorthand label is used to distinguish the
conﬁgurations which have the same occupation of the
intruder/hyperintruder/megaintruder orbitals (the same
[n1(n2)(n3),p1(p2)(p3)] label) but diﬀer in the occupation
of non-intruder orbitals.

III. THE 40CA NUCLEUS

40Ca is a doubly magic spherical nucleus with 20 neu-
trons and 20 protons. Three lowest shells with N = 0,
1 and 2 are occupied in its spherical ground state with
I = 0+. Higher spin states are formed by particle-hole
excitations from the N = 2 shell into f7/2(N = 3) sub-
shell across the respective Z = 20 and N = 20 spherical
shell gaps. This leads to a formation of complicated high-
spin level scheme which includes spherical states and de-
formed, terminating and superdeformed rotational struc-
tures [22, 24, 74]. In experiment, they extend up to spin
I = 16+.

The results of the CRMF calculations for deformed
conﬁgurations forming the yrast line are shown in Fig. 1.
Diﬀerent colors are used to indicate diﬀerent classes of
the bands. Note that low-spin spherical solutions are not

and near-spherical shape. Additional excitations of the
proton and neutron across the Z = 20 and N = 20
spherical gaps lead to a more deformed [2,2] conﬁgura-
tion which has β2 ∼ 0.32 and γ ∼ −30◦ at I = 10~. It
is expected to terminate at Imax = 20~ with the termi-
nating state built at high energy cost and located high
above the yrast line. However, we were not able to trace
this conﬁguration up to termination in the calculations.
Next excitations of proton and neutron across the Z = 20
and N = 20 spherical gaps lead to even more deformed
[3,3] conﬁgurations which are located close to each other
up to spin I = 16~ (see Fig. 1). The conﬁguration which
terminates at spin I = 18~ is located in positive γ mini-
mum of potential energy surfaces and has β2 ∼ 0.47 and
γ ∼ 21◦ at I = 12~. The structure of terminating state

is π(f7/2)3
1.5. Another [3,3]
conﬁguration is located in the negative γ minimum of
potential energy surfaces and is expected to terminate at

7.5(d3/2)

I = 24+. Similar to the [2,2] conﬁguration we were not
able to trace it up to terminating state which is expected
to be located high above the yrast line.

Subsequent particle-hole excitations lead to an increase
of the deformation of the conﬁgurations resulting in the
formation of superdeformed rotational bands. Note that
the bands with such deformation do not terminate in
the single-particle terminating states (see Sec. 2.5 of Ref.
[20]). The yrast SD conﬁguration [4,4] is characterized by
large SD shell gap at particle number 20 both in the pro-
ton and neutron subsystems (Fig. 2). All single-particle
states below these gaps are occupied in the [4,4] conﬁg-
uration. Note that apart of the Coulomb shift in energy
the proton routhian diagram is similar to the neutron
one shown in Fig. 2. The [4,4] conﬁguration is only yrast
at I = 22~; it is located above the yrast line at lower
spin in agreement with the experiment [22]. The accu-
racy of the description of the experimental data (dynamic
and kinematic moments of inertia, transition quadrupole
moments) is similar to the one obtained with the NL1
CEDF; the results obtained with this functional are com-
pared with experiment in Ref. [22].

Starting from the yrast SD conﬁguration [4,4] there are
two ways to build excited conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst one is
by exciting particles from the 3/2[321](r = ±i) orbitals
into the 1/2[200](r = ±i) orbitals; they are shown as the
S1−S4 excitations in Fig. 2. The combination of pro-

ton and neutron excitations of this type leads to the [3,3]
conﬁgurations. If the proton (neutron) excitations of this
type are combined with the neutron (proton) conﬁgura-
tion of the yrast SD band, the [3,4] and [4,3] conﬁgura-
tions are created. These conﬁgurations are excited with
respect to the yrast [4,4] SD conﬁguration; some of them
are shown by red lines in Fig. 1. Note that due to the
similarity of the proton and neutron routhian diagrams
some of these excited conﬁgurations are degenerated (or
nearly degenerated) in energy. In addition, we show only
some of highly excited SD conﬁgurations for the sake of
clarity. An important feature is quite large energy gap
between the yrast [4,4] and lowest excited [3,3]d SD con-
ﬁgurations. Such a situation favors the observation of the
yrast SD band since the feeding intensity is concentrated
on it (see discussion in Refs. [19, 75]).

Alternatively, one can excite the particle from either
the 5/2[202](r = −i) or 5/2[202](r = +i) orbital to the
lowest in energy hyperintruder 1/2[440](r = −i) orbital
emerging from hyperintruder N = 4 shell; the occupation
corresponding to such a conﬁguration is shown on left
side of Fig. 3. The combination of the proton and neu-
tron excitations of this kind leads to four-fold degener-
ate [41,41] HD conﬁgurations. This degeneracy is due to
very small signature splitting of the conﬁgurations built
on opposite signatures of the 5/2[202] orbitals and the
combination of proton and neutron conﬁgurations of this
kind.

At ﬁrst glance this statement is in contradiction with
Fig. 3 where there is a substantial energy splitting be-
tween the r = −i and r = +i branches of the 5/2[202]
orbital which are almost parallel in rotational frequency.
This feature is the consequence of non-pairwise occupa-

tion of the opposite signatures of some orbitals which
leads to the presence of nucleonic currents at rotational
frequency Ωx = 0.0 MeV (see Sec. IVA in Ref. [58]). The
occupied orbital is always more bound than its unoccu-
pied time-reversal counterpart. So the change of the sig-
nature of occupied 5/2[202] state (from r = −i in Fig. 3
to r = +i) will only inverse the relative positions of both
signatures of this orbital so that the total energy of the
conﬁgurations built on the holes in the 5/2[202](r = −i)
and 5/2[202](r = +i) orbitals will be almost the same.

The [41,41] conﬁgurations are the lowest in energy
among the HD conﬁgurations at spins above I = 24~
(Fig. 1). The excited HD conﬁgurations [31,31]a and
[31,31]b (Fig. 1) are formed as the combination of the
H1 and H2 excitations (shown in Fig. 3) in the proton
and neutron subsystems. The [31,41]a and [31,41]b con-
ﬁgurations are based on the H1 and H2 excitations in the
neutron subsystem and the proton conﬁguration of the
yrast [41,41] HD conﬁguration. The [41,31]a and [41,31]b
conﬁgurations (not shown in Fig. 1), based on the H1 and
H2 excitations in the proton subsystem and the neutron
conﬁguration of the yrast [41,41] HD conﬁguration, are
located at the energies which are similar to the ones of
the [31,41]a and [31,41]b conﬁgurations.

The HD conﬁgurations never become yrast in 40Ca.
However, such conﬁgurations compete with megade-
formed ones for yrast status in neigbouring nuclei (see,
for example, Secs. IV and VI A). That was a reason for
a quite detailed discussion of their structure.

The additional occupation of the N = 4 proton and
neutron orbitals leads to the [42,42] MD conﬁguration
which is yrast at spin above I = 23~ (Fig. 1).
It is
characterized by large (around 3 MeV) MD Z = 20 and
N = 20 shell gaps (Fig. 4). Thus, this conﬁguration can
be considered as doubly magic megadeformed conﬁgura-
tion. Indeed, excited MD conﬁgurations (such as [42,51],
[51,51], [51,42] etc) are located at excitation energy of
more than 2 MeV with respect to the yrast MD conﬁgu-
ration (Fig. 1). The fact that the yrast MD conﬁguration

[42,42] is separated from the excited conﬁgurations by a
such large energy gap should make its observation in ex-
periment easier. This is because of the concentration of
feeding intensity on the yrast MD conﬁguration in such
a situation (see discussion in Refs. [19, 75]).

Calculated transition quadrupole moments Qt and γ-
deformations of the normal- and highly-deformed triax-
ial, SD, HD and MD conﬁgurations are shown in Figs.
5, 6 and 7. The conﬁgurations which are yrast in lo-
cal deformation minimum, namely, SD [4,4], HD [41,41]
and MD [42,42] have the largest transition quadrupole
moment among the calculated SD, HD, and MD conﬁgu-
rations, respectively. This is because particle-hole excita-
tions leading to excited conﬁgurations reduce the number
of occupied deformation driving orbitals.

Note that most of the calculated SD conﬁgurations
have γ ∼ −12◦.
The only exception is the un-
usual [31,31]a conﬁguration which has large positive γ-

similarities with the HD conﬁgurations. First, it involves
the N = 4 proton and neutron. Second, its slope in the
E − ERLD plot is similar to the one of the HD conﬁgura-
tions (see Fig. 1). However, it has substantially smaller
Qt values as compared with the HD conﬁgurations.

While the calculated Qt and γ values cluster for the
SD conﬁgurations (Figs. 5a and c), they are scattered for
the HD conﬁgurations (Figs. 5b and d). This suggests
that the potential energy surfaces are much softer in the
HD minimum as compared with the SD one. Indeed, in
the HD minimum a single particle-hole excitation induces
much larger changes in the Qt and γ values than in the

9

SD one. On the contrary, the MD conﬁgurations show
the clusterization of the calculated Qt and γ values which
is similar to the one observed in the SD minimum (Fig.
7).

The most deformed HD conﬁguration ([41,41]) has Qt
values which are by roughly 40% larger than the ones for
most deformed SD conﬁguration ([4,4)]) (Fig. 5a and c).
Yrast MD conﬁguration [42,42] has the Qt values which
are larger by roughly 45% and 105% than the ones for
most deformed HD and SD conﬁgurations (compare Fig.
7a and Fig. 5a and c).

The self-consistent proton densities of the yrast SD,
HD and MD conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 8 at in-
dicated spin values. The stretching of nuclear shape is
deﬁnitely more pronounced in the HD [41,41] and espe-
cially in the MD [42,42] conﬁgurations. Indeed, the semi-
major to semi-minor axis ratio is 2.05, 2.27 and 2.9 for
the densities of the SD [4,4], HD [41,41] and MD [42,42]
conﬁgurations. Note that the changes in the semi-axis
ratio on going from one type of conﬁgurations to another
are substantially smaller than relevant changes in the Qt
values discussed above. The densities of the [41,41] HD
conﬁguration show some indications of the development
of neck and these indications become much more pro-
nounced in the MD [42,42] conﬁguration.

[64].

Fig. 9 compares the results of the calculations with
and without pairing for few selected conﬁgurations in
40Ca. The calculations with pairing are performed in the
cranked relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (CRHB) frame-
work of Ref.
In these calculations the Lipkin-
Nogami method is employed for an approximate parti-
cle number projection and the Gogny D1S force is used
in pairing channel. The presence of pairing correlations
leads to an additional binding. However, above I = 10~
this additional binding is rather modest (around 0.5 MeV
or less) and it is similar for diﬀerent calculated conﬁgura-
tions. As a result, the general structure of the calculated
conﬁgurations in the E − ERLD plot above this spin is
only weakly aﬀected by the presence of pairing. Simi-
lar eﬀect has already been seen in the case of 72Kr (Ref.
[76]).

Note that among large number of the conﬁgurations
obtained in unpaired calculations and presented in Fig.
1 only these three conﬁgurations (terminating [2,2]a, su-
perdeformed [4,4] and hyperdeformed [42,42]), in which
signature partner orbitals are pairwise occupied (see Figs.
2 and 4), can be calculated in the CRHB framework with-
out blocking procedure. Particle-hole excitations leading
to excited conﬁgurations remove pairwise occupation of
the signature partner orbitals. As a result, the blocking
procedure has to be employed for the calculation of such
conﬁgurations in the CRHB framework. For example,
the blocking of two particles is needed if the conﬁgu-
ration label contains at least one odd number in either
proton or neutron subsystem. If the conﬁguration label
contains odd number in both proton and neutron sub-
systems, then the blocking of four particles (two in pro-
ton subsystem and two in neutron subsystem) is needed.

Such calculations are inherently unstable [57, 77]. On
the other hand, the blocking leads to an additional re-
duction of the impact of pairing correlations on physical
observables (see Ref. [57]). As a result, even smaller ef-
fect of pairing (as compared with the one shown in Fig.
9) is expected on binding energies of the conﬁgurations
of Fig. 1 not shown in Fig. 9.

IV.

42SC NUCLEUS

42Sc nucleus is formed by an addition of one proton
and one neutron to 40Ca. This is only odd-odd nu-
cleus considered in the present paper. The conﬁgura-
tions forming the yrast line of 42Sc are shown in Fig. 10.
The [1,1] conﬁguration is built in valence space; it ter-
minates at I = 7+. The [2,2] conﬁguration is an analog
of the [1,1] conﬁguration in 40Ca but with an extra pro-
ton and extra neutron placed into the orbitals emerging
from the f7/2 spherical subshell. As a consequence, it
has substantially larger deformation and maximum spin
within the conﬁguration than the [1,1] conﬁguration in
40Ca. At spin I = 4~, the deformation of the [2,2] con-
ﬁguration is β2 ∼ 0.27 and γ ∼ −15◦.
It terminates
at I = 15+ in a terminating state with the structure

shape with β2 ∼ 0.05.

Additional excitations of the proton and neutron

across the Z = 20 and N = 20 spherical gaps lead to
a more deformed [3,3] conﬁguration which has β2 ∼ 0.37
and γ ∼ −31◦ at I = 10~. It is expected to terminate at
Imax = 23~ with the terminating state built at high en-
ergy cost and located above the yrast line. However, we
were able to trace this conﬁguration in the calculations
only up to I ≈ 22~ (one ~ short of termination).

The lowest four SD conﬁgurations [4,4] in 42Sc are
formed from the yrast SD conﬁguration [4,4] in 40Ca by
addition of the proton and neutron to the 1/2[200](r =
±i) orbitals located above the Z = 20 and N = 20 SD
shell gaps (see Fig. 2). Their deformation properties are
summarized in Fig. 11. Similar to the SD bands in 40Ca,
they are located in the γ ∼ −12◦ minimum of potential
energy surfaces. Note that the lowest [4,4] SD conﬁg-
uration undergoes unpaired band crossing (due to the
crossing of the 1/2[400](r = −i) and 1/2[200](r = −i)
orbitals seen in Fig. 2) which leads to the [41,41] HD
conﬁguration.

At spin above I = 22~, the HD conﬁguration [41,41]
becomes the lowest in energy. In this conﬁguration, all
single-particle states below the Z = 21 and N = 21 HD
shell gap (Fig. 3) are occupied. So contrary to the yrast
HD bands in 40Ca, which are degenerate in energy, the
yrast HD line in 42Sc is represented by a single strongly
decoupled branch of the [41,41] conﬁguration.

At even higher spin (above I = 30~), the yrast line
is formed by the megadeformed conﬁguration [421,421]

(Fig. 10). This conﬁguration contains the proton and
neutron in the lowest megaintruder N = 5 orbital above
the unpaired band crossing at Ωx ∼ 1.80 MeV (above
I = 31~). At lower spin the structure of this MD conﬁgu-
ration is [52,52]; this is a result of unpaired band crossing
emerging from the interaction of the lowest megaintruder
(N = 5)(r = +i) orbital with the 1/2[321](r = +i) or-
bital taking place at Ω ∼ 1.8 MeV (Fig. 4). Note that
this band crossing is blocked in the closely lying [52,52]
MD conﬁguration, shown by solid blue line in Fig. 10, in
which the 21th proton and 21th neutron are placed into
the 1/2[321](r = −i) orbital located above the Z = 20
and N = 20 MD shell gaps.

Proton density distributions for the HD conﬁguration
[41,41] and MD conﬁgurations [52,52] and [421,421] are
shown in Fig. 12. The major semi-axis ratio of the proton
density distribution increases only moderately (from 2.23
to 2.65 [see Table I]) on going from the [41,41] conﬁgura-
tion to the [52,52] one. However, this transition triggers
drastic change in transition quadrupole moment Qt; it is
increased from Qt ∼ 2.65 eb for the [41,41] conﬁguration
to Qt ∼ 4.5 eb for the [52,52] conﬁguration (see Fig. 11).
The occupation of the megaintruder proton and neutron
N = 5 orbitals leading to the MD [421,421] conﬁguration
creates both additional elongation of the proton density
and neck in this density distribution (see bottom pan-
els of Fig. 12). The [421,421] conﬁguration is the most
elongated structure studied in the present paper. Three-
dimensional representation of its density distribution is
shown in Fig. 1a of Supplemental Material (Ref. [79]).
This density distribution has large semi-axis ratio of 3.40
at I = 31 which is increasing with spin (Table I). In part,
this large value is a consequence of the development of
the neck which leads to small semi-axis in the direction
perpendicular to elongation. Note that despite large dif-
ference in the semi-axis ratio (3.40 for the [421,421] con-
ﬁguration and 2.65 for the [52,52] one), the Qt value of
the [421,421] conﬁguration (Qt ∼ 5.2 eb at I = 31~) is
only by 15% larger that the one for the [52,52] conﬁgura-
tion (see Fig. 11). These examples clearly indicate that
there is no simple relation between the semi-axis ratio of
the proton density distribution and transition quadrupole
moments.

V. THE GENERAL FEATURES OF HIGH-SPIN
SPECTRA

The discussion of low-spin spectra in Secs. III and IV
clearly shows the importance of particle-hole excitations
across the N = 20 and Z = 20 spherical shell gaps in
building angular momentum and deformation. The most
striking example is 40Ca in which only the ground state
could be built in the valence space. Here the valence
space is deﬁned as the conﬁguration space which does not
involve particle-hole excitations across either the N = 20
and Z = 20 spherical shell gaps or the N = 28 and
Z = 28 spherical shell gaps.

The maximum spin which could be built in the valence
space of nuclei is summarized in Table II. It is deﬁned
with respect of spherical 40Ca core by the occupation of
proton and neutron f7/2 orbitals in the Ca, Sc, Ti and Cr
nuclei and by the proton and neutron holes in the N = 2
d3/2, s1/2 and d5/2 orbitals in the Ar and S nuclei. One
can see that the maximum spin increases on approaching
the middle of the f7/2 subshell where it reaches the max-
imum value of Imax = 16~ in the π(f7/2)4
8.0 ⊗ ν(f7/2)4
8.0
conﬁguration of 48Cr. Note that the addition of two neu-
trons to this conﬁguration decreases the maximum spin
which could be built in the valence space of 50Cr (see
Table II).

Table II also illustrates how the maximum spin, which
could be built within the conﬁguration, changes when
particle-hole excitations across the spherical Z = 20 and
N = 20 spherical shell gaps are involved. Here 2p-2h
conﬁgurations are deﬁned as the conﬁgurations which
involve the excitations of one proton and one neutron
across the respective shell gaps. The excitations of two
protons and two neutrons across these gaps lead to the
4p-4h conﬁgurations. The impact of these excitations on
the maximum spin depend on how many occupied f7/2
orbitals in the Ca, Sc, Ti and Cr nuclei (or holes in the
N = 2 orbitals of the Ar and S nuclei) the nucleus has
in its valence space. One can see that these excitations
increase drastically the maximum spin within the conﬁg-
urations of 40Ca but have limited impact on maximum
spin in 48Cr (Table II).

The analysis of the 40Ca and 42Sc nuclei clearly in-
dicates that subsequent particle-hole excitations lead to
the yrast or near-yrast SD, HD and MD conﬁgurations at
the spins which are either similar to the maximum spins
which could be built within the 2p-2h and 4p-4h conﬁg-
urations or slightly above them. Note that the nuclei in
these 2p-2h and 4p-4h conﬁgurations could at most be
described as highly-deformed.

The importance of these 2p-2h and 4p-4h conﬁgura-
tions lies in the fact that at low and medium spins they
dominate the yrast line and thus are expected to be popu-
lated in experiment with high intensity. The observation
of the SD, HD and MD conﬁgurations requires that these
bands are either yrast or close to yrast at the spins where
the feeding of the bands takes place. This is especially
critical for the HD and MD bands since in most of the nu-

12

clei they have completely diﬀerent slope in the E − ERLD
plots as compared with the bands of smaller deformation.
As a result, their excitation energies with respect to the
yrast line grow up very rapidly with decreasing spin be-
low the spins where the HD and MD bands are yrast or
near yrast. This factor will limit the spin range in which
they can be observed in future experiments to the spin
range in which these bands are either yrast or close to
yrast and few states below this spin range.

Considering the limitations of experimental facilities to
observe high spin states in light nuclei, it is imperative
that expected candidates for the SD, HD and MD bands
become yrast (or close to yrast) at the spins which are not
far away from currently measured. Indeed, with current
generation of detectors the SD bands in 36Ar [25] and
40Ca [22] and ground state band in 48Cr [78] are observed
up to I = 16~ which represents the highest spin measured
in this mass region. The advent of γ-tracking detectors
such as GRETA and AGATA will increase the spin up
to which the measurements could be performed but this
increment in spin is not expected to be drastic.

Note that the results discussed in this section only il-
lustrate the general features of rotating nuclei and pro-
vide some crude estimates of the competition of termi-
nating and extremely deformed conﬁgurations. Indeed,
detailed calculations are needed to deﬁne the properties
of such bands and the spins at which extremely deformed
conﬁgurations become yrast. For the sake of simplicity,
we also do not discuss here possible excitations across the
spherical N = 28 and Z = 28 shell gaps. Terminating
conﬁgurations based on such excitations compete with
the SD, HD and MD conﬁgurations only in 46Ti and Cr
nuclei (see Secs. VI D, VI E and VI F below).

The examples of the 40Ca and 42Sc nuclei discussed
above once more conﬁrm that rotating nuclei are the
best laboratories to study the shape coexistence.
In-
deed, starting from either spherical or weakly deformed
ground states by means of subsequent particle-hole ex-
citations one can built any shape (prolate, oblate, triax-
ial, super-, hyper- and megadeformed as well as cluster
and/or molecular structures [see Sec. VII below for a dis-
cussion of latter structures/shapes]) in the same nucleus.

VI. OTHER NUCLEI IN THE
NEIGBOURHOOD OF 40CA

The results for other nuclei studied in this paper will be
presented in this section. In the calculations of terminat-
ing structures at low and medium spins we concentrate on
the conﬁgurations which deﬁne the general structure of
the yrast line and the spins at which the transition to ex-
tremely deformed conﬁgurations takes place. Apart from
few interesting cases, we do not discuss them in detail.
The main focus of this section is on the super-, hyper-
and megadeformed rotational conﬁgurations and, in par-
ticular, on the ones which potentially show the features
In order to
of clusterization and molecular structures.

provide the guidance for future experiments, we present
the (E − ERLD) plots and the ﬁgures with transition
quadrupole moments and γ-deformations for each nu-
cleus. In addition, the proton density plots are provided
for the yrast or near-yrast conﬁgurations which could be
measured in future experiments. The goals behind that
is to see the evolution of the density distribution with
conﬁguration and nucleus and to ﬁnd interesting candi-
dates for clusterization and molecular structures. Note
that some graphical results of the calculations are pro-
vided in the Supplemental Material with this article as
Ref. [79].

A.

42Ca nucleus

The energies of calculated conﬁgurations are shown in
Fig. 13. The calculated transition quadrupole moments
and γ-deformations of these conﬁgurations are displayed
in Fig. 14. Note that this nucleus has two extra neutrons
as compared with 40Ca which aﬀects the structure of the
conﬁgurations.

The SD conﬁgurations are represented by the [4,4]a,
[4,4]b, [4,4]c, [5,4]a and [5,4]b conﬁgurations (Fig. 13).
The yrast [4,4]a SD conﬁguration in 42Ca is formed by
an addition of two extra neutrons in the 1/2[200] orbitals
(located above the N = 20 SD shell gap [Fig. 2]) to the
yrast [4,4] SD conﬁguration of 40Ca. Note that similar
to 40Ca the SD conﬁgurations in 42Ca are triaxial with
γ ∼ −12◦.

At spin I ∼ 23~, the expected continuation of the
SD [4,4] conﬁguration is crossed by the HD [42,41] con-
ﬁguration which is formed from the yrast HD [41,41]
conﬁguration in 40Ca (Fig. 3) by adding one neutron
into the 1/2[440](r = +i) orbital and another into the
5/2[202](r = +i) orbital. The HD [42,41] conﬁguration
has near prolate shape with Qt value which exceed by
50% the Qt values which are typical for the SD bands
(Fig. 14).

Axially symmetric MD conﬁguration [62,42] becomes
yrast above I = 26~ (Fig. 13). At these spins, its tran-
sition quadrupole moment is by ∼ 50% larger than that
of the HD [42,41] conﬁguration (Fig. 14).

Proton density distributions of the yrast SD [4,4]a and
MD [62,42] conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 2a of sup-
plemental material (Ref. [79]) and Figs. 33c and d below,
respectively. The major semi-axis ratio is 2.17 and 2.79
for these conﬁgurations (Table I). However, the Qt values
of the latter conﬁguration are by a factor of more than 2
larger than those of the former one (Fig. 14).

B. The 44Ca nucleus

The SD conﬁgurations are represented by the [6,4]
and [51,4] conﬁgurations (Fig. 15). However, up to spin
I ∼ 22~ the total yrast line is formed by the normal-
and highly-deformed triaxial terminating conﬁgurations

Note that for some conﬁgurations several aligned (terminat-

discussed in Sec. 6.6 of Ref. [20].

and these SD conﬁgurations are located at high excita-
tion energy with respect to the total yrast line. Only
around I ∼ 24~, the [51,4] SD conﬁguration becomes
yrast. However, already at spin I = 26~ and above the
yrast line is formed by closely lying [62,41] HD and [62,42]
MD conﬁgurations.

The calculated values of the transition quadrupole mo-
ment Qt of these conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 3 of
supplemental material (Ref. [79]). Proton density dis-
tribution of the MD [62,42] conﬁguration is displayed in
Fig. 2b in the supplement to present paper (Ref. [79]).
The [62,51] conﬁguration, shown by dashed cyan line in
Fig. 15, is lying closely in energy to these two conﬁgu-
rations. Its calculated Qt values are in the between the
ones for the HD and MD conﬁgurations (see Fig. 3 in the
supplement).

The yrast line of 44Ca shows that with increasing neu-
tron number up to N = 24 (which leads to the place-
ment of the neutron Fermi level in the middle of deformed
single-particle states emerging from spherical 1f7/2 sub-
shell) it become energetically favorable to excite the neu-
tron across the spherical N = 28 shell gap. Such excita-
tion leads to the occupation of the lowest 1g9/2 neutron
orbital (which carries substantial single-particle angular
momentum) and, in the case of 44Ca, to the formation
of the [41,2] and [41,3] conﬁgurations which terminate at
spins I = 21, 22 and 24~ (Fig. 15). As a consequence,
the yrast line could be built by either normal- or highly-
deformed terminating conﬁgurations up to higher spins in
44Ca as compared with lighter Ca isotopes (compare Figs.
15, 13 and 1). As a result, the observation of the SD, HD
and MD conﬁgurations would be more diﬃcult in heavier
Ca isotopes as compared with 40Ca. Note that this mech-
anism of neutron excitations across the N = 28 spherical
shell gap aﬀects also the yrast line in 46Ti (conﬁgura-
tion [41,4], Fig. 18). Similar proton excitation across the

 
 
 
 
 
Z = 28 spherical shell gap become active in the Cr iso-
topes. Indeed the conﬁgurations of the type [*1,*1] built
on simultaneous neutron and proton excitations across
the N = 28 and Z = 28 spherical shell gaps are active in
the creation of the yrast line at medium spin in 48,50Cr
(see Figs. 20 and 21 below).

FIG. 17.

(Color online) The same as Fig. 5 but for 44Ti.

The SD conﬁgurations are represented by the [41,41]
and [51,51] conﬁgurations (see Figs. 16 and 17). These
conﬁgurations are either yrast or very close to yrast line
above I = 24~ after the crossing with expected contin-
uation of the [4,4] conﬁguration. The [4,4] and [4,4]a
conﬁgurations may also be considered as SD at low spin
since they are located at the borderline between the SD
and highly-deformed bands. The increase of the pro-
ton and neutron numbers to 22 leads to a decrease of
the impact of the hyperintruder N = 4 orbitals.
In-
deed, the [41,41] and [51,51] conﬁgurations have tran-
sition quadrupole moments Qt which are only slightly
above the one typical for the SD conﬁgurations (Fig. 17).

Only the occupation of additional proton and neutron
N = 4 hyperintruder orbitals leads to the conﬁguration
[42,42] (see Fig. 16) which is truly hyperdeformed (Fig.
17). However, the HD conﬁgurations are never yrast in
this nucleus. At spin I ∼ 29~, the MD [62,62] conﬁg-
uration becomes yrast. Proton density distribution of
this conﬁguration (see Figs. 33e and f below) could be
compared with the one for the SD [41,41] conﬁguration
(see Fig. 2c in the supplemental material (Ref. [79])).
Its three dimensional representation is shown in Fig. 1b
of the supplement to this manuscript. The Qt value of
the MD conﬁguration is larger than the one for the SD
conﬁguration by a factor of approximately 2.5 (Fig. 17).
On the other hand, the diﬀerence in the ratio of major
semi-axis of the density distribution of these two conﬁg-
urations is smaller (the major semi-axis ratio is 2.88 for
the [62,62] conﬁguration and 2.03 for the [42,42] conﬁg-
uration [Table I]).

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D. The 46Ti nucleus

As discussed in Sec. VI B, the increase of neutron num-
ber to N = 24 leads to a situation in which the particle-
hole excitations across the N = 28 spherical shell gap
create the conﬁgurations which contribute to the yrast
line at medium spin (the [4,4] conﬁguration terminating
at I = 25~, Fig. 18). At higher spin the SD [62,51]a
conﬁguration becomes yrast. The HD [62,42] conﬁgura-
tion is only slightly excited in energy with respect to this
conﬁguration. Proton density distributions of these two
conﬁgurations are shown in Figs. 2d and e of supplemen-
tal material (Ref. [79]). Note that the MD conﬁgurations
are not energetically favored in this nucleus and they do
not show up in the vicinity of the yrast line in the spin
range of interest. The calculated Qt and γ-deformation
values of the conﬁgurations displayed in Fig. 18 are sum-
marized in Fig. 19.

48Cr nucleus

The valence space terminating [4,4] conﬁguration is
forming the yrast line up to I = 16~ (Fig. 20). This
band has been observed in experiment up to its termi-
nation in Ref. [78]. Particle-hole excitations across the
Z = 20 and N = 20 spherical shell gaps lead to only
marginal increase of angular momentum content of the
conﬁgurations but cost a lot of energy (see, for example,
the conﬁgurations [4,5] and [5,5] in Fig. 20 and Table II).

15

Higher spin conﬁgurations are built at a reasonable en-
ergy cost by particle-hole excitations across the Z = 28
and N = 28 spherical shell gaps. Such excitations lead
both to terminating and SD/HD conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst
type of conﬁgurations is represented by the [41,41] one
which terminates at I = 30~. The SD [52,52] and HD
[62,62] conﬁgurations lying at similar energies become the
lowest conﬁgurations at spin I ≥ 30~ (Fig. 20). Note that
the resonance observed at I ∼ 36~ in the 24Mg+24Mg
reaction strongly supports a HD shape for a compound
48Cr nucleus formed in this reaction [30]. The evolution
of proton density distribution with spin in the [62,62] con-
ﬁguration is shown in Figs. 2f and g of the supplemental
material (Ref. [79]). The Qt and γ-deformation values
are summarized in Fig. 5 of the supplemental material.

50Cr nucleus

The calculated conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 21. Be-
low spin I = 14~, the yrast line is built from valence
space [6,4] conﬁguration. Higher spin terminating con-
ﬁgurations ([51,4], [51,31] and [51,41]) are build by means
of particle-hole excitations across the Z = 28 and N = 28
spherical shell gaps. They dominate the yrast line up to
I = 31~. At even higher spin closely lying HD [62,62] and
[72,62] conﬁgurations are either yrast or close to yrast.
Transition quadrupole moments Qt and γ-deformations
of the calculated conﬁgurations are summarized in Fig.
6 of the supplemental material (Ref. [79]). An example
of proton density distribution is shown in Fig. 2h of the
supplemental material for the HD [62,62] conﬁguration at
I = 31~. Note that neither superdeformed nor megade-
formed conﬁgurations show up in the vicinity of the yrast
line in this nucleus in the spin range of interest.

G.

36Ar nucleus

The maximum spin which could be built in the valence
space of this nucleus is quite limited, namely, 8~ in the
[0,0] conﬁguration (Fig. 22 and Table II). Particle-hole
excitations leading to the [1,1] conﬁgurations increase
this spin up to 16~ (conﬁguration [1,1]a in Fig. 22). Sub-
sequent particle-hole excitations generate the [2,2] con-
ﬁgurations the maximum spin within which is 20~ (see
Table II).

One of such conﬁgurations terminating at I = 16~ is
assigned to the SD band observed in Refs. [25, 26]. Its
properties have been studied earlier within the spheri-
cal shell model [80] and cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky ap-
proach [25, 26]. Based on the calculated deformation
properties, this conﬁguration could be considered as SD
only at low spin. This is because with increasing spin its
transition quadrupole moment Qt is decreasing rapidly
and γ-deformation is increasing up to γ = 60◦ (Fig. 23).
Terminating state of this conﬁguration/band is reached
at I = 16+ both in theory (Fig. 22) and in experiment
(Refs. [25, 26]). From our point of view, the classiﬁ-
cation of this band as highly-deformed triaxial is more
appropriate but we label it as SD in Fig. 1 following the
classiﬁcation established in the literature.

At spin above I = 16~, the yrast line is built from
the HD [4,4] and MD [31,31] conﬁgurations. It is easy
to understand the structure of these conﬁgurations from
the routhian plot for the [42,42] MD conﬁguration in 40Ca
(Fig. 4). The [4,4] conﬁguration in 36Ar is built by remov-
ing two protons and two neutrons in the N = 4 orbitals
from the MD [42,42] conﬁguration in 40Ca. The [31,31]
conﬁgurations in 36Ar are built by removing one proton
and one neutron in the N = 4 orbital from the [42,42]
conﬁguration in 40Ca and another proton and another
neutron from the 3/2[321] orbital of the same conﬁgura-
tion. Since opposite signature branches of the 3/2[321]
orbital are either degenerate in energy (as in Fig. 4) or

16

have very small energy splitting, four [31,31] conﬁgura-
tions are calculated at close energies. For simplicity, we
show only the lowest one in Fig. 22.

Note that in many calculations these extremely de-
formed structures do not form a stable minimum in the
potential energy surfaces at spin zero (see, for example,
Fig. 2 in Ref. [12]). Thus, the rotation helps to stabilize
this minimum. This is similar to the situation with the
stabilization of hyperdeformation at high spin in medium
mass nuclei (Ref. [19]).

The transition quadrupole moments Qt and γ-
deformations of the calculated conﬁgurations are sum-
marized in Fig. 23. One can see that the Qt values of
the [4,4] and [31,31] MD conﬁgurations are by approxi-
mately 66% and 100% larger than the normalized transi-
tion quadrupole moment Qnorm
for the SD shapes. Pro-
t
ton density distributions of the SD [2,2] (at low spin),
HD [4,4] and MD [31,31] and [41,41] conﬁgurations are
shown in Fig. 24 (see also Table I for the density semi-
axis ratios). Three-dimensional representation of the pro-
ton density distribution in the MD [31,31] conﬁguration
is shown in Fig. 1c of the supplemental material (Ref.
[79]). The SD shapes are characterized by more com-
pact (with higher average density in the interior of the
nucleus) density distribution as compared with the HD
and MD shapes (Fig. 24). The formation of the necking
degree of freedom is clearly seen in the MD [31,31] and
[41,41] conﬁgurations.

The results obtained in the cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky
(CNS) approach are very similar to the CRMF ones (see
Fig. 6 in Ref. [41]).
Indeed, the MD [31,31] conﬁgu-
rations are yrast above spin I = 18~ also in the CNS
calculations. Considering that both experimental data
in this nucleus extends up to I = 16+ and yrast or
near yrast higher spin conﬁgurations are formed from
HD and/or MD ones, the calculations in the CRMF and
CNS frameworks clearly indicate this nucleus as one of
the best candidates for the observation of the hyper- and
megadeformations. In simple words, if it will be possible
to bring higher (than 16~) angular momentum into this
system, the population of the HD and MD states is the
most likely outcome of this process.

H.

38Ar nucleus

Low-spin yrast line in this nucleus is built from termi-
nating conﬁgurations (Fig. 25). The lowest SD conﬁgu-
ration [3,2]a is close to the yrast line at medium spin and
it becomes yrast above I = 17~ (Fig. 25). Similar to the
observed SD band in 36Ar, it terminates in non-collective
state but at higher spin of I = 22~. Its proton density
distribution at the medium spin of I = 12~ is shown in
Fig. 3a of the supplemental material (Ref. [79]). The
yrast line above I = 22~ is built from the [42,31] MD sig-
nature partner conﬁgurations with small energy splitting
(Fig. 25). They diﬀer in the occupation by third pro-
ton of diﬀerent signatures of the 3/2[321] orbital; there

is almost no signature splitting between the diﬀerent sig-
natures of this orbital (see Fig. 4). An interesting feature
of this conﬁguration is substantial impact of rotation on
the density distribution leading to a larger elongation
and more pronounced necking with increasing spin from
I = 24~ to I = 32~ (see Figs. 33a and b below). This
however is not associated with the substantial change of
transition quadrupole moment Qt (Fig. 26).

I.

32S nucleus

17

The SD conﬁgurations were predicted in 32S long time
ago in Refs. [81, 82]. The SD bands built on such struc-
tures have been studied both in non-relativistic cranked
DFTs based on the Gogny [40, 83] and Skyrme [37, 39]
forces and in the CRMF calculations with the NL3 CEDF
in Ref. [41]. The detailed structure of the yrast spectra
of this nucleus has also been investigated in the cranked
Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) approach in Ref. [41]. Note
that contrary to more microscopic studies which are lim-
ited to collective structures, this CNS study considers
also terminating/aligned states along the yrast line which
is important for a proper description of the yrast line at
low and medium spins.

Fig. 27 shows the high-spin structures in 32S. The low-
est SD conﬁguration with the structure [2,2] is yrast
above spin I = 10~. The same result has also been
obtained in other models quoted above. Above spin
I = 24~, the occupation of the lowest N = 4 hyper-
intruder proton and neutron orbitals leads to the HD
[21,21] conﬁguration. Note that this induces an unpaired
band crossing the consequence of which is the impos-
sibility to trace in the calculations the SD band above
I ∼ 23~ and HD band below I ∼ 27~. This problem
could be avoided if diabatic orbitals would be built using
an approach of Ref. [20]; the expected diabatic continu-
ations of the SD [2,2] and HD conﬁgurations [21,21] are
shown by dotted lines in Fig. 27. Note that the CNS cal-
culations of Ref. [41] also suggest that the lowest HD con-
ﬁguration has the [21,21] structure and becomes yrast at
similar spins. The same HD conﬁguration has also been
obtained in cranked Skyrme HF calculations of Ref. [37];
it also become yrast around I ∼ 25~ in the calculations
with SIII and SkM* Skyrme forces.

t

At spin I = 0, the calculated Qt values for the [2,2] SD
conﬁguration are 50% larger than Qnorm
(Fig. 28). This
would even allow to describe this band as HD. However,
at this spin the [2,2] SD conﬁguration is located around
10 MeV above the ground state which prevents its obser-
vation. The rotation and the limited angular momentum
content in low deformation conﬁgurations brings this SD
conﬁguration to the yrast line. However, it also triggers
the decrease of the collectivity (as measured by Qt) so
this conﬁguration is more properly described as SD in
the spin range where it is yrast. The occupation of the
lowest N = 4 proton and neutron orbitals leading to the
[21,21] HD conﬁguration triggers substantial increase of
Qt; at spin I = 31~ it is by 60% larger than the Qnorm
.
Density distributions of the [2,2] and [21,21] conﬁgura-
tions at spins of interest are shown in Fig. 29. Note
that many [1,1] conﬁgurations are of transitional type;
they are SD only at very low spins (Fig. 28) and are only
highly-deformed at higher spins. Truly SD conﬁgurations
are obtained with additional occupation of the N = 3 or-
bital leading to either [2,1] or [1,2] conﬁgurations (Fig.
28).

yrast SD [2,2] conﬁguration and excited conﬁgurations
in the spin range I = 16 − 22~ (Fig. 27). Although this
would favor the population of this conﬁguration, all ex-
perimental attempts to observe this band undertaken in
the beginning of the last decade have failed.

The conﬁgurations in the 34S nucleus are formed from
the ones in 32S by adding two neutrons in respective or-
bitals. The [2,1] conﬁgurations in 34S are similar to the
[1,1] ones in 32S; they are SD at low spin but lose the
collectivity with increasing spin so that they are better
described as highly-deformed at the highest calculated
spins (Fig. 31).
Indeed, their density distributions at
medium and high spins are characterized by rather mod-
est semi-axis ratio; this is seen in Fig. 3b of the sup-
plemental material (Ref. [79]) on the example of the [2,1]
conﬁguration which has semi-axis ratio of 1.32 (see Table
I) at I = 14~. Similar to 32S truly SD shapes are formed
with the occupation of at least two N = 3 protons and
two N = 3 neutrons. They are represented by the [2,2]
SD conﬁguration (which is yrast above I = 16~ [see Fig.
30]) and by the excited [3,2] and [3,2]a SD conﬁgura-
tions. The occupation of the lowest N = 4 neutron and
proton orbitals leads to the HD conﬁgurations [31,21] and
[31,11]. The ﬁrst conﬁguration is yrast at spin I = 20~
and above (Fig. 30) and its proton density distribution
is shown in Fig. 32.

VII. CLUSTERIZATION AND MOLECULAR
STRUCTURES

One of the main goals of the present paper is the search
for possible candidates showing clusterization and molec-
ular structures in the near-yrast region of the nuclei un-
der study. Diﬀerent single-particle states have diﬀerent
spatial density distributions which are dictated by their

underlying nodal structure of their wavefunctions (see
Fig. 9 in Ref. [47]); the centers of the density distribu-
tion are found at the nodes and peaks of the oscillator
eigenfunctions. The total density distribution is built as
a sum of the single-particle density distributions of oc-
cupied single-particle states. Thus, for some speciﬁc oc-
cupations of the single-particle states at some deforma-
tions one may expect the eﬀects in the density distribu-
tions which could be interpreted in terms of clusterization
and molecular structures. Note that the structure of the
wavefunctions of the single-particle orbitals is aﬀected
by rotation (see discussion in Sec. V of Ref. [47]); this
could lead to a modiﬁcation of the single-particle den-
sity distributions (see Fig. 9 in Ref. [47]). For some of
the orbitals the eﬀect of rotation on single-particle den-
sity distributions is quite substantial, while it has very
little impact on the single-particle density distributions
for others. This could lead either to a destruction or the
emergence/enhancement of the clusterization and molec-
ular structures with rotation.

Well known case of molecular structure in this mass
region is the superdeformed conﬁguration [2,2] in 32S;
according to Refs. [3, 11] the wavefunction of this band
contains signiﬁcant admixture of the molecular 16O+16O
structure.
Indeed, the development of neck is seen in
its density distribution (Fig. 29a). Similar neck exists
also in the HD [21,21] conﬁguration of 32S (Fig. 29b) but
the presence of density depressions at z ∼ ±2 fm may
suggest more complicated structure than the pair of two
16O. In addition, the neck is also present in the density

distribution of the [31,21] conﬁguration in 34S but this
conﬁguration is characterized by an unusual density dis-
tribution with density depression in the highly elongated
central region which is surrounded by the region of maxi-
mum density (Fig. 32). Note that the SD conﬁgurations,
which have the structure of 16O+16O+two valence neu-
trons in molecular orbitals, have recently been predicted
in the AMD+GCM calculations of Ref. [7].

Present study reveals also a number of other interest-
ing molecular structures which are discussed below. We
were able to trace some of such conﬁgurations in an ex-
tended spin range starting from spin zero (or from very
low spin), at which they are located at 20 − 30 MeV ex-
citation energy above the ground state, up to very high
spin where they are either yrast or close to the yrast
line. These are the [42,31] and [42,22] MD conﬁgurations
in 38Ar (Fig. 25), the [31,31] and [41,41] MD conﬁgu-
rations in 36Ar (Fig. 22), the [42,42] MD conﬁguration
in 40Ca (Fig. 1), the [62,42] MD conﬁguration in 42Ca
(Fig. 13), the [62,62] MD conﬁgurations in 44Ti (Fig. 16)
and [52,52] and [421,421] MD conﬁgurations in 42Sc (Fig.
10). These examples allowed us to study the impact of

The molecular structures become well pronounced in
the [31,31] and [41,41] MD conﬁgurations of 36Ar (Fig.
24c and d) which are characterized by well established
neck. They are also seen in the [42,31] conﬁguration of
38Ar (Figs. 33a and b); note that in this case the rotation
increases the separation of the fragments and makes the
neck much more pronounced.

In 40Ca, the density distribution of the MD [42,42]
conﬁguration at spin zero shows a triple-humped struc-
ture (top panel of Fig. 34). Similar conﬁguration has
been analyzed in Ref. [3] and it was concluded that α-
cluster interpretation becomes quite fuzzy. Alternatively,

one may consider this conﬁguration as a 12C+16O+12C
chain built of distorted 16O and 12C nuclei. The va-
lidity of such interpretation should be veriﬁed in future
by comparison with the results of the cluster and/or an-
tisymmetrized molecular (AMD) calculations similar to
the ones presented in Ref. [3]. The comparison of the
density distributions for this conﬁgurations at I = 0~
and I = 25~ (see Fig. 34) shows that the rotation hin-
ders the tendency for clusterization. Indeed, the central
hump becomes less pronounced and the depressions in
the density distributions develop in central parts of the
left and right segments at I = 25~ (bottom panel of Fig.
34).

Similar eﬀects are also seen in the MD [42,22] conﬁg-
uration of 38Ar (see Fig. 7 in the supplemental material
(Ref. [79]) which could be considered as the MD [42,42]
conﬁguration of 40Ca with two proton holes in the N = 3
orbitals. The addition of two neutrons to the MD [42,42]
conﬁguration of 40Ca creates the MD [62,42] conﬁgura-
tion in 42Ca which has the features in the proton density
distribution (see Figs. 33c and d) similar to the ones seen
in Fig. 34.

These results show that in few conﬁgurations discussed
above the rotation tries to suppress the features of the
density distribution which could be attributed to the
clusterization. However, the density modiﬁcations in-
duced by rotation deﬁnitely depend on the nucleonic con-
ﬁguration. For example, the density distribution of the
[62,62] conﬁguration in 48Cr is modiﬁed only modestly by
rotation (see Figs. 2f and g in the supplemental material
(Ref. [79]). Note that this conﬁguration does not show
the features typical for clusterization. On the other hand,
with increasing spin the separation of the fragments be-
comes larger and the neck becomes more pronounced in
the [42,31] conﬁguration of 38Ar (Figs. 33a and b) and
the [421,421] conﬁguration of 42Sc (Fig. 12c and d).

Another interesting case of possible clusterization is
the [62,62] MD conﬁguration in 44Ti (Fig. 33e and f).
Three fragments are clearly seen in the density distribu-
tion at I = 0~ indicating possible 16O+12C+16O chain
of nuclei. Note that with rotation the central fragment

21

dissolves but two outer segments became slightly more
pronounced. It is interesting that similar three fragments
structure survives in the [52,52] MD conﬁguration up to
very high spins in 42Sc (Fig. 12b). This conﬁguration
could be considered as built from the [62,62] one in 44Ti
by creating proton and neutron holes in the N = 3 or-
bital.

Very interesting case of molecular structures is seen on
the example of the [421,421] MD conﬁguration in 42Sc
(Figs. 12c and d and and Fig. 1a in the supplemental
material (Ref. [79]). This system could probably be de-
scribed as a combination of two prolate deformed 20Ne
cores located in tip-to-tip arrangement with extra proton
and neutron.

It is necessary to understand that suggested interpre-
tations of molecular structures are based on the consider-
ation of only density distributions. Their validity should
be veriﬁed in future by the analysis of the wavefunctions
of the underlying conﬁgurations (and their overlaps with
mean ﬁeld solutions) obtained in the cluster and/or anti-
symmetrized molecular dynamics calculations similar to
the ones presented in Refs. [3, 11].

VIII. ROTATIONAL PROPERTIES OF
EXTREMELY DEFORMED CONFIGURATIONS

Most important physical observables characterizing
the SD, HD and MD structures are kinematic (J (1))
and dynamic (J (2)) moments of inertia and transition
quadrupole moments Qt. The latter provides a direct in-
formation on the deformation of the charge distributions
and that was a reason why the calculated Qt values were
presented earlier.
It is however necessary to recognize
that previous history of the experimental investigation
of the SD bands clearly shows that the Qt quantity is
measured in dedicated experiment and thus it is avail-
able only for small fraction of the SD bands.

Thus it is expected that in future experiments it will be
easier to obtain the information on rotational properties
of the bands which are described in terms of kinematic
and dynamic moments of inertia using the following ex-
pressions

J (1)(Ωx) = J

J (2)(Ωx) = J

the prescription given in Sec. 4.1 of Ref. [20]. Note that
the kinematic moment of inertia depends on the absolute
values of spins, while only the diﬀerences ∆I = 2 enter
the deﬁnition of dynamic moment of inertia.

The SD bands observed in the A ∼ 40 mass region are
exception from the general rule that the SD bands are
very seldom linked to the low-spin level scheme. Thus,
contrary to absolute majority of the SD bands in nuclear
chart their spins are known; it is quite likely that some
SD bands which will be observed in this mass region in
future will follow this pattern. On the contrary, it is
expected that the spins of the HD and MD bands will
be diﬃcult to deﬁne in future experiments. For such
bands, only dynamic moment of inertia will be available
for comparison with the results of calculations.

The kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia of the
(typically lowest in energy) SD, HD and MD bands are
presented in Fig. 35 for each nucleus under study. For
majority of the SD and HD bands one observes that the
following condition J (1) ≥ J (2) is satisﬁed at medium
and high frequencies. As discussed in Ref. [20] this con-
dition is valid for the rotational bands in unpaired regime.
This condition is not valid in the region of unpaired band
crossing with weak interaction where J (2) grows rapidly
with increasing rotational frequency. This takes place at
the highest calculated frequencies in the [2,2] SD conﬁg-
uration of 32S (Fig. 35a), [4,4] SD conﬁguration in 40Ca
(Fig. 35e), and [62,62] HD conﬁguration in 48Cr (Fig.
35k). Note also that such situation is seen at medium
spin in the [31,21] HD conﬁguration of 34S (Fig. 35b)

tional properties of above discussed MD bands are very
similar to the HD ones in the Z = 40 − 58 mass region
investigated in Ref. [19, 75]. On the other hand, the
[31,31] MD conﬁguration in 36Ar (Fig. 35c) and [42,31]
MD conﬁguration in 38Ar (Fig. 35d) show the relative
properties of the two moments similar to the ones seen
in the majority of the SD and HD bands shown in Fig.
35.

The examples shown in Fig. 35 clearly indicate strong
dependence of the calculated J (1) and J (2) values on the
nucleonic conﬁguration and frequency.
In most of the
cases, at medium and high rotational frequencies there
is a correlation between the moments of inertia and de-
formation so that the moments of inertia increase with
increasing deformation. However, there are exceptions
from this observation. For example, the dynamic mo-
ments of inertia of the [4,4] SD and [41,41] HD conﬁg-
urations in 42Sc are quite similar (see Fig. 35h) despite
substantial diﬀerence in the transition quadrupole mo-
ments (see Fig. 11a). Even more striking example is the
similarity of dynamic moments of inertia of the [3,3] SD
and [31,31] MD conﬁgurations in 36Ar (Fig. 35c). Such
similarities are also seen for the kinematic moments of
inertia as illustrated by the case of the [52,52] SD and
[62,62] HD bands in 48Cr (Fig. 35k). Thus, the decision
on the nature of the band (SD, HD or MD) observed in
experiment cannot be based solely on the measured val-
ues of dynamic or kinematic moments of inertia; only the
measurement of the transition quadrupole moment can
reveal the true nature of the band.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

and the [51,4] SD conﬁguration of 44Ca (Fig. 35g).

The moments of inertia of the MD bands show three
diﬀerent patterns of behavior. Some of the MD bands un-
dergo a centrifugal stretching that result in an increase
of the transition quadrupole moments Qt with increas-
ing rotational frequency. This process also reveals itself
in the moments of inertia: the kinematic moments of in-
ertia are either nearly constant or slightly increase with
increasing rotational frequency, whereas the dynamic mo-
ments of inertia show two patterns of behavior. In one of
them the dynamic moment of inertia is almost the same
as kinematic one at low to medium rotational frequencies
but then J (2) becomes bigger than J (1) and the diﬀer-
ence between them gradually increases with frequency.
These are the MD conﬁgurations shown in Figs. 35e, f, g
and i. The pattern of the behavior of the [421,421] MD
conﬁguration in 42Sc is very diﬀerent (Fig. 35h); both
moments increase with increasing rotational frequency
but J (2) ≥ J (1) at all calculated frequencies. Note that
this conﬁguration has most elongated density distribu-
tion among studied in the present paper with clear in-
dication of molecular structure (see Sec. III.) The rota-

A systematic search for extremely deformed structures
in the N ∼ Z A ∼ 40 nuclei has been performed for the
ﬁrst time in the framework of covariant density functional
theory. The aim of this study was to deﬁne at which spins
such structures become yrast, their properties and to ﬁnd
the conﬁgurations showing the ﬁngerprints of clusteriza-
tion and molecular structures. The main results can be
summarized as follows.

• Present investigation shows that extremely de-
formed structures inevitably become yrast with in-
creasing spin in the nuclei under study. This is be-
cause normal and highly-deformed conﬁgurations
forming the yrast line at low and medium spins
have limited angular momentum content. The key
question is at which spin the transition from termi-
nating to extremely deformed conﬁgurations takes
place. This is basically deﬁned by the maximum
spin which could be built in terminating conﬁgu-
rations with limited number of particle-hole exci-
tations across the respective spherical shell gaps.
This spin is quite limited for particle-hole excita-
tions across the proton Z = 20 and neutron N = 20
spherical shell gaps. As a result, the nuclei most

squares and blue triangles are used for the SD, HD and MD conﬁgurations, respectively.

favored for the observation of extremely deformed
structures are located in the vicinity of 36Ar and
40Ca. For example, present calculations suggest
that in 36Ar the increase of spin above measured
I = 16~ state is only possible by the population of
the hyperdeformed band. On the contrary, the con-
ﬁgurations built on particle-hole excitations across
the spherical N = 28 and N = 28 gaps, which bring
substantial amount of angular momentum, domi-
nate the yrast line at medium spin (up to I ∼ 30~)
in the Cr nuclei. As a result, only at higher spins
extremely deformed conﬁgurations become yrast.

• Similar to previous studies in the medium mass nu-
clei [19, 75], present calculations indicate that the
N = Z nuclei are better candidates for the observa-
tion of extremely deformed structures as compared

with the nuclei which have an excess of neutrons
over protons since the transition to extremely de-
formed structures takes place at lower spins.

• The above discussed consideration of the most fa-
vored candidates for experimental observation of
extremely deformed structures is based on the spins
at which they become yrast in model calculations.
However, it is expected that experimental observa-
tions will also depend on employed combination(s)
of the target(s) and projectile(s) and respective
cross-sections of the reactions. Taking this factor
and related uncertainties into account the N = Z
and N = Z + 2 S, Ar, Ca, and Ti isotopes should
be considered as good candidates for experimen-
tal observation of extremely deformed structures.
On the other hand, the experimental observation

 
 
 
of such structures in the 48,50Cr isotopes is clearly
disfavored by the present analysis as compared with
above mentioned N = Z and N = Z + 2 isotopes.

• The underlying single-particle structure of nucle-
onic conﬁgurations with speciﬁc nodal structure of
the single-particle density distribution leads to a
clusterization in the form of molecular structures.
The calculations suggest that in some nuclei such
structures are either yrast or close to yrast at high
spin. Thus, their observation with new genera-
tion of γ-tracking detectors such as GRETA and
AGATA may be possible in near future. The calcu-
lations with cluster or/and antisymmetrized molec-
ular dynamics models are deﬁnitely needed in or-
der to establish the weights of those clusters in the
structure of total wavefunction.

• The impact of rotation on the density distribu-
tion and clusterization (molecular nature) depends
sensitively on nucleonic conﬁguration. The den-
sity distributions of some conﬁgurations are only
weakly aﬀected by rotation. The features typical
for clusterization, which are present at zero spin,
are washed away by rotation in other conﬁgura-
tions. On the other hand, the clusterization is en-

25

hanced by rotation in some speciﬁc conﬁgurations;
with increasing spin the separation of the fragments
becomes larger and the neck becomes more pro-
nounced.

• There is a strong dependence of the calculated kine-
matic and dynamic moments of inertia on the con-
ﬁguration and frequency. In most of the cases the
moments of inertia increase with increasing defor-
mation at medium and high rotational frequencies.
However, there are exceptions from this observa-
tion. As a result, the decision on the nature of
the band (SD, HD or MD) observed in experi-
ment cannot be based solely on the measured val-
ues of dynamic or kinematic moments of inertia;
only the measurement of transition quadrupole mo-
ments will reveal the true nature of the band.
