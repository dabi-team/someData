Abstract

The honeycomb lattice iridate Na2IrO3 shows frustrated magnetism and can potentially display

Kitaev-like exchange interactions. Recently, it was shown that the electronic properties of the

surface of crystalline Na2IrO3 can be tuned by Ar plasma treatment in a controlled manner leading

to various phases of matter ranging from a fully gapped to a metallic surface, where the possibility

of a charge-density wave (CDW) like transition is also expected. Here, through direct imaging

with an atomic force microscope (AFM) in air, we show that the surface of crystalline Na2IrO3

evolves rapidly as elemental Na eﬀuses out of the interleave planes to the surface and undergoes

sublimation thereby disappearing from the surface gradually over time. Using conductive AFM

we recorded a series of topographs and surface current maps simultaneously and found that the

modiﬁcation of the surface leads to change in the electronic properties in a dynamic fashion until

the whole system reaches a dynamic equilibrium. These observations are important in the context

of the exotic electronic and magnetic properties that the surface of Na2IrO3 displays.

Na2IrO3 has been recognized as a promising playground for studying various strongly cor-

related phenomena1–3. Owing to its potential for showing novel ground states driven by the

interplay of spin orbit coupling and strong electron correlations4–7, it has drawn considerable

attention of the condensed matter community and inspired a great deal of theoretical and

experimental eﬀorts1,8–12. Na2IrO3 has a layered honeycomb structure where oxygen medi-
ated super-exchange between the Ir4+ moments is expected to result in practical realization

of a Kitaev model system2,5. Depending on the relative strength of the spin-orbit coupling

term in the Hamiltonian, it can show diﬀerent ground states including conventional Neel

order and quantum spin liquid behaviour with excitations comprising of the hitherto elusive

Majorana fermions2,3,10,13,14. Under certain conditions, Na2IrO3 has also been proposed to

be a topological insulator, a material with a bulk band gap and topologically protected

conducting surface states thereby becoming a possible candidate to show quantum spin Hall

(QSH) eﬀect at relatively higher temperatures15,16. As expected, the physical properties

of Na2IrO3 depend on variation of the crystal structure, especially the change in interlayer

distance and the nearest neighbour interaction strength17. First principle calculations based

on eﬀective tight binding model have shown that a small change in the interlayer distance

of Na2IrO3 or interaction strength can drive a regular band insulator phase of Na2IrO3 to a

topological insulating phase through a quantum phase transition18. On experimental side,

recently it has been reported that the electronic properties of the surface of Na2IrO3 sin-

gle crystals can be tuned by doping through Ar plasma treatment in a controlled manner

ranging from a fully gapped to a metallic surface, where the possibility of a charge-density

wave (CDW) like instability is also speculated19. Hence, it is of signiﬁcant importance to

study the surface properties20 of Na2IrO3 crystals in detail. In this paper, we report detailed

investigation of the physical, chemical and electronic properties of the surface of high quality

Na2IrO3 crystals using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in various modes.

High quality single crystals were used for the measurements presented in this paper. The

crystals were available in the form of ﬂakes with layers that can be easily cleaved mechan-

ically. The freshly cleaved samples were mounted on the sample stage of an atomic force

microscope (MFP 3D of Asylum Research) within 2-3 minutes of cleaving and the cleaved

surfaces were imaged in non-contact mode using Si cantilevers with Pt-Ir coating. The spring

constant of the cantilevers varied in a small range around 1.0 N/m. An AFM topograph

of a freshly cleaved sample surface is shown in Figure 1(a). The tiny granular structures

are blobs of metallic sodium (Na) that have diﬀused out from the layers underneath. The

average size of the grains is approximately 8 nm and they continuously grow in size. As

shown in Figure 1(b), the size of the blobs have almost doubled after 10 hours and the

average size of the grains are seen to be approximately 15 nm. Beyond 10 hours, some of the

blobs started coalescing with each other thereby giving rise to a distribution of particle size

over the same scan area. Several blobs with average height larger than 20 nm can be seen

to have grown after 20 hours of continuous scanning (Figure 1(c)). The size of the grains

keep growing and as shown in Figure 1(d) the average size of the blobs have become more

than 30 nm after 30 hours and the coalescing eﬀect is more prominently visible in images

captured after 40 hours (ﬁgure 1(e)) and 50 hours (ﬁgure 1(f)) of cleaving. Imaging of the

same area was continuously done for 70 hours and the gradual increase in blob size can be

clearly seen in the movie ﬁle provided as supplemental material. It can be seen that the

blob size does not change noticeably beyond 50 hours.

EDX analysis of the surface revealed that while in the clean area of the surface, ratio

compared to that of Na. Since EDX is a surface sensitive characterizing technique, it can be

inferred that the blobs are primarily composed of sodium and the absence of Iridium points

towards the fact that elemental sodium has eﬀused out from the layers underneath.

The eﬀusing Na clusters cover the entire surface suﬃciently long time after cleaving

and it is natural to expect that they will contribute to surface conductivity of the crystal.

In order to check whether the blobs on the top surface are electrically connected to the

bottom surface, we performed conductivity mapping of the top surface of crystal. For such

experiments, the bottom surface of the sample was grounded and a conducting tip, mounted

at the end of a soft cantilever, was brought in contact with the top surface. A voltage

bias of 10V was applied to the tip and local current variations along with topography were

recorded. A current map corresponding to a topography of 8µm x 8µm area (Figure 2(a))

is shown in Figure 2(e).

(d) show the topography of the same area and (e), (f), (g) and (h) show corresponding current

maps.

The bright regions in the current map correspond to the areas having more conductivity

as compared to the dark regions. This means, sites having blobs of elemental sodium show

higher conductivity in contrast to the background. Figure 2(b) and 2(c) are the topographs

contact mode, it modiﬁes the surface by dragging the sodium to the edges of the scan area,

thereby cleaning the area. Removal of sodium blobs from the area is clearly seen in the

current maps (Figure 2(f) and Figure 2(g)) where a sharp decrease in current is observed

compared to that seen during ﬁrst scan in contact mode. After four subsequent scans, most

of the eﬀused sodium was removed (Figure 2(d)) from the scan area and consequently current

dropped to zero (Figure 2(h)).

In order to further investigate the dynamics of the surface, we monitored the time

evolution of the topographic features in the area scanned during the previous conductivity

measurements (Figure 3(a)) from where Na blobs were removed by the tip. This was done

continuously for next 40 hours. After 10 hours of scanning, we observed the sodium blobs

emerging from the bottom left corner of the area under investigation (Figure 3(b)). The size

of the blobs gradually grew in the next 10 hours (Figure 3(c)).

(a), (b), (c) and (d) are observed at an interval of 10 hours each.

Fresh sodium blobs continued to emerge on the surface in other parts of the scan area

and spread over the entire surface as it can be seen in the image captured after 40 hours

(Figure 3(d)). This observation, as it is clear in the supplementary video-2, supports the

After around 50 hours, the growth of the blobs almost stopped possibly due to a dynamic

equilibrium established between eﬀusion and spontaneous sublimation of Na. After this

situation was achieved, we performed conductive AFM measurements again by applying a

voltage bias of 6V over the same area and obtained the current distribution as shown in Fig

4. In Fig 4(e), a current of 1-2pA is observed from the surface wherever sodium is present.

As the Na is removed from the area by the tip due to multiple scans, the current dropped

to zero again as shown in Fig 4(h).

the topographs while (e), (f), (g), (h) are the corresponding current maps of four successive scans.

The Na clusters formed on the area that was previously cleaned by the tip start dis-

appearing from the surface after some time due to continued sublimation and exhaustion of

eﬀusive Na and as a consequence the blob size start reducing (Figure 5). The images (a),

(b), (c), (d) in Fig 5 are the snapshots after 15 hours interval. The brighter grains visible in

Fig 5(a) turn faint in the Fig 5(b) and (c) and ﬁnally disappear into background (Fig 5(d)).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the surface of Na2IrO3 crystals become Na

rich due to eﬀusion of Na from the bulk. The eﬀusing sodium get accumulated in the

form of clusters on the crystal surface. Therefore, the observation of the exotic properties

that Na2IrO3 can potentially exhibit might be prohibited due to the eﬀusion of Na to the

surface. We have also shown that the Na clusters on the surface can be cleaned mechanically.

From scanning probe microscopy in diﬀerent modes we have shown that such clusters of

Na make the surface signiﬁcantly conductive.

If the crystals are cooled down right after

cleaning, the eﬀusion process can be minimized and its intrinsic properties can be retained

for investigation.
