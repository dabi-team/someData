ABSTRACT

Aims. In this paper, multiwavelength observations of remote coronal dimmings related to an M1.1 circular-ribbon ﬂare (CRF) in
active region (AR) 12434 are reported.
Methods. The conﬁned ﬂare without a CME was observed by AIA and HMI on board SDO on 2015 October 16. Global three-
dimensional (3D) magnetic ﬁelds before ﬂare were obtained using the potential ﬁeld source surface modeling.
Results. A few minutes before the ﬂare hard X-ray peak time (06:13:48 UT), small-scale, weak dimming appeared ∼240′′ away
from the ﬂare site, which can be observed by AIA only in 131 and 171 Å. Afterwards, long and narrow dimmings became evident
in all AIA EUV passbands except 304 Å, while localized core dimming was not clearly observed near the ﬂare site. The large-area
dimmings extended southeastward and the areas increased gradually. The total area of dimmings reaches (1.2±0.4)×104 Mm2 in 193
Å. The maximal relative intensity decreases in 171 and 193 Å reach 90% and 80%, respectively. Subsequently, the dimmings began
to replenish and the area decreased slowly, lasting for ≥3 hr. The remote dimmings and AR 12434 were connected by large-scale
coronal loops. The remote dimmings were associated with the southwest footpoints of coronal loops with weak negative polarities.
Possible origins of remote dimmings are discussed.

1. Introduction

Coronal dimmings are transient
regions of greatly re-
duced emission in extreme-ultravoilet (EUV) and soft X-
ray (SXR) wavelengths (Hudson et al. 1996; Thompson et al.
1998, 2000). They are tightly related to CMEs and/or so-
lar ﬂares (Reinard & Biesecker 2009; Krista & Reinard 2017;
Dissauer et al. 2018a,b, 2019; Veronig et al. 2019). When a
CME rises and erupts into the interplanetary space, the coro-
nal source region is impulsively evacuated and the plasma den-
sity is heavily depleted (Harrison & Lyons 2000; Harrison et al.
2003; Mason et al. 2014). The percentage of density depletion
could reach up to 50%−70% (Vanninathan et al. 2018). Persis-
tent upﬂows at speeds of hundreds of km s−1 have been observed
using the spectroscopic observations (Harra & Sterling 2001;
Harra et al. 2007; Attrill et al. 2010; Dolla & Zhukov 2011;
Tian et al. 2012; Veronig et al. 2019). The Doppler velocities de-
pend on the formation temperatures of ions (Jin et al. 2009), and
the most signiﬁcant dimmings can be observed at temperatures
of a few MK (Zhukov & Auchère 2004; Robbrecht & Wang
2010).

According to the location, coronal dimmings can be
classiﬁed into deep core dimmings near the ﬂare site and
widespread diﬀuse dimmings (Zarro et al. 1999; Mandrini et al.
2005; Attrill et al. 2007; Delannée et al. 2007). The deep core
dimmings or twin dimmings are related to the footpoints
of a ﬂux rope, while the secondary diﬀuse dimmings re-

sult from continuing ﬁeld line stretching during the erup-
tion (Mandrini et al. 2007; Miklenic et al. 2011; Dissauer et al.
2018b; Vanninathan et al. 2018). The widths of dimmings are
positively correlated with the CME widths (Reinard & Biesecker
2008). The velocity and mass of CMEs are found to be intimately
related to the slope and depth of the dark voids left behind CMEs
(Mason et al. 2016).

In most cases, coronal dimmings appear in the impul-
sive phase of a ﬂare that is consistent with the acceleration
phase of the corresponding CME (Cheng & Qiu 2016). The
typical evolution of dimming area is characterized by a sharp
rise followed by a slow recovery via magnetic reconnection
(Attrill et al. 2006; Reinard & Biesecker 2008). The total area
and unsigned magnetic ﬂux of dimmings are ∼1010 km2 and
∼1021 Mx (Dissauer et al. 2018b). The total lifetime of dim-
mings ranges from 3 to 12 hr with an average value of ∼8 hr
(Reinard & Biesecker 2008). Using the high-resolution and mul-
tiwavelength observations from the Atmospheric Imaging As-
sembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory (SDO), Zhang et al. (2017) discovered pre-ﬂare
coronal dimmings, which lasted for ∼96 minutes before the im-
pulsive phase of an eruptive ﬂare. It is proposed that pre-ﬂare
dimming serves as a precursor of twin dimmings. Additional
events about pre-eruption dimmings were investigated and re-
ported (Qiu & Cheng 2017; Wang et al. 2019).

lived circular-ribbon ﬂares (CRFs) were produced (Zhang et al.
2016a,b). Zhang et al. (2019) calculated the energy partition of
two M1.1 CRFs taking place on October 15 and 16, respectively.
In this paper, remote coronal dimmings related to the M1.1 ﬂare
on October 16 are investigated to explore the relationship be-
tween CRFs and coronal dimmings. Observations and data anal-
ysis are described in Sect. 2. Discussions and a brief summary
are shown in Sect. 3.

2. Observations and data analysis

The M1.1 ﬂare was observed by AIA (Zhang et al. 2019). AIA
takes full-disk images in 7 EUV wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193,
211, 304, and 335 Å) with a cadence of 12 s and in two UV
wavelengths (1600 and 1700 Å) with a cadence of 24 s. The pho-
tospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms are observed by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012)
on board SDO with a cadence of 45 s. The spatial resolutions of
AIA and HMI are 2′′. 4.

Figure 1 shows six snapshots of the AIA 304 Å images. It
is clear that the CRF was triggered by the eruption of a mini-
ﬁlament at ∼06:13 UT. During its eruption, the arc-shaped erup-
tive ﬁlament (EF) was heated and became bright in 304 Å. SXR
light curves of the ﬂare with a cadence of ∼2.05 s are plotted
in Fig. 2(a). The ﬂux in 1−8 Å increased rapidly from ∼06:11
UT to ∼06:16 UT, which was followed by a gradual decay phase
until ∼06:35 UT. The hard X-ray (HXR) ﬂux at 25−50 keV ob-
served by the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) is plotted in Fig. 2(b). The
peak time (06:13:48 UT) indicative of the highest energy release
rate is denoted by the black dashed line.

The conﬁned ﬂare was neither associated with a CME nor
with localized core dimming near the ﬂare site. Instead, it was
related to remote dimmings ∼240′′ away in the quiet region. To
better illustrate the coronal dimmings, the base-ratio technique
is applied by taking the EUV images at ∼06:00:00 UT as base
images (Dissauer et al. 2018a). Figure 3 shows 4 snapshots of
base-ratio images during 06:07−06:11 UT in 131 Å and 171
Å. It is surprising that small-scale, narrow dimming appeared
to the southwest of ﬂare a few minutes before the onset of ﬂare,
which is considered as pre-ﬂare dimming. The area increased
very slowly with the intensity decreasing. We have checked the
base-ratio images in other EUV wavelengths and found that pre-

able in the online edition.

ﬂare dimming was prominent only in 131 and 171 Å with for-
mation temperatures of log T ≈ 5.6 − 5.8 in the lower corona.

In Fig. 4, the 193 Å base-ratio images illustrate the evolu-
tion of large-area remote dimmings after the onset of ﬂare. Long
and narrow dimmings, which were cospatial with the pre-ﬂare
dimming, appeared shortly after ∼06:14 UT. As time went on,
the dimmings extended southeastward with the area increasing
rapidly. The dimmings were replenished and the area reduced
slowly after the maxima. The temporal and spatial relationships
between pre-ﬂare dimming and large-area dimmings suggest that
remote dimmings started from the pre-ﬂare dimming and devel-
oped into large-area dimmings. Hence, the pre-ﬂare dimming
may serve as a precursor of large-area dimmings.

In Fig. 4(e), ﬁve small boxes (“D1”-“D5”) within the dim-
mings are selected and investigated. Time evolutions of the av-
erage base-ratio intensities within the ﬁve boxes in 193 Å are
plotted in Fig. 2(c). The intensity evolution is characterized by a
sharp decrease followed by a gradual recovery. It is obvious that
the intensity depletion of D1 preceded that of D2. The deple-
tions of D3-D5 were further delayed, which is consistent with the
southeastward extension of large-area remote dimmings. More-
over, the relative intensity decrease of D1 reaches ∼80%, which
is considerably higher than that of D3 (∼45%). Owing to the
diﬀerent formation temperatures and heights of AIA EUV pass-
bands, the degrees of intensity depletion are diﬀerent accord-
ingly. In Table 1, the maximal relative intensity decreases of the
large-area dimmings are listed. It is revealed that the dimmings
can remarkably be detected in 171, 193, and 211 Å, and are less
remarkable in 94, 131, and 335 Å (Vanninathan et al. 2018).

In Fig. 4(e), the remote dimmings are encompassed by white
dashed lines. The total area of dimmings is deﬁned as the sum of
pixels whose intensities are less than 85% of the pre-ﬂare level

at 06:00 UT. Time evolutions of the dimming area in diﬀerent
wavelengths are plotted in Fig. 2(d). It is found that the area
increased quickly to the apex around 07:16 UT before declin-
ing tardily. The lifetime of dimmings exceeded 3 hr, with a rise
time of ∼1 hr and a recovery time of ≥2 hr. In Fig. 2(d), the
recovery rate (∼1800 Mm2 hr−1) of large-area dimmings is la-
beled. Assuming a constant recovery rate, the dimmings would
be totally recovered ∼4.8 hr after 09:00 UT. Therefore, an up-
per limit of the lifetime of dimmings is nearly 8 hr. The dim-
ming area reaches ∼1.2×104 Mm2 in 193 Å and amounts to only
6000−8000 Mm2 in 131 and 335 Å. In Table 1, the maximal total
areas of the remote dimmings in diﬀerent wavelengths are listed
when the intensity threshold changes from 75% to 95% of the
pre-ﬂare levels.

In Fig. 4(c), an artiﬁcial slice (S1) with a length of 300′′ is
selected, which starts from the ﬂare core and goes across the
large-area dimmings. Time-distance diagrams of S1 in diﬀerent
wavelengths are displayed in Fig. 5(a)-(f). It is obvious that lo-
calized core dimming near the ﬂare was not observed. As soon
as the ﬂare occurred, remote dimmings appeared about 240′′
away. The apparent speeds of expansion of dimmings along S1
are measured to be 8−15 km s−1, with a mean value of ∼11 km
s−1. In Fig. 4(f), a curved slice (S2) with a length of 338′′. 5 is
selected, which goes through the entire remote dimmings. Time-
distance diagrams of S2 in diﬀerent wavelengths are shown in
Fig. 5(g)-(i), indicating that the extraordinary large-area dim-
mings extended in the southeast direction.

In Fig. 6, the original AIA image in 171 Å before ﬂare is
displayed in panel (a). Two arrows point to the footpoints (FP1
and FP2) of imaginary large-scale coronal loops (CLs), which
are more distinct in 211 Å. In panel (b), the base-ratio image in
211 Å at 06:16:12 UT is shown. The oblique arrows indicate the
directions of quick expansion of the CLs. The apparent speeds

ated with strong positive polarity, while FP2 in the quiet region is
associated with weak negative polarities. In Fig. 6(f), the global
magnetic ﬁelds obtained from the potential ﬁeld source surface
(PFSS; Schrijver & De Rosa 2003) modeling at 06:04:00 UT is

Å at 07:30:00 UT, where the bright patch corresponds to large-
scale CLs and the dark dimmings correspond to the footpoints
(FP2) of CLs. Combining the EUV observations, LOS magne-
togram, and 3D magnetic conﬁguration, it is concluded that FP1
and FP2 are the footpoints of large-scale, overlying CLs.

3. Discussion and summary

As mentioned in Sect. 1, there are two types of coronal dimmings
in EUV wavelengths, core dimming and widespread diﬀuse dim-
mings that cover a large fraction of the solar surface (e.g.,
Thompson et al. 1998; Delannée et al. 2007; Dissauer et al.
2018b). They are mainly due to sudden density depletion
when CMEs and/or ﬂares take place (Harrison & Lyons 2000;
Harrison et al. 2003). After investigating three ﬂare-related EIT
waves, Delannée (2000) found multiple dimmings: a ﬁrst dim-
ming between the bright front and the ﬂare, a second dimming
between the bright front and a magnetic dipole, and a third dim-
ming in transequatorial loops connecting the ﬂare region with
another dipole. In this work, the primary dimming surround-
ing the ﬂare was not obvious. Only remote dimmings appeared
directly far from the ﬂare site in the quiet region. The pres-
ence of remote dimmings in all EUV wavelengths except 304
Å suggests that the dimmings are interpreted by density deple-
tion rather than temperature variation (Mason et al. 2014). The
degrees of intensity decrease are comparable to those of CME-
associated dimmings (Dissauer et al. 2018b). The evolution of
remote dimmings is characterized by a rapid increase followed
by a gradual decay, which is similar to typical CME-associated
dimmings (Reinard & Biesecker 2008). Both the rise and re-
covery times are close to those of CME-associated dimmings
(Reinard & Biesecker 2008). The total areas have the same order
of magnitude as the CME-associated dimmings and are close to
the median value (2.15×104 Mm2) (Dissauer et al. 2018b).

After studying two conﬁned ﬂares triggered by the ﬁlament
eruption, Yang & Zhang (2018) discovered that the erupting ﬁl-
aments are guided by large-scale ﬁeld lines and ﬁnally reach the
remote site (see their Fig. 3). In a follow-up work, Yang et al.
(2019) proposed a two-step evolution of a magnetic ﬂux rope, the
standard rising phase producing a pair of parallel ribbons and the
external reconnecting phase, during which the eruptive ﬂux rope
reconnects with the large-scale, overlying CLs (see their Fig. 7).
The external reconnection results in transfer and redistribution
of the magnetic helicity. Meanwhile, the large-scale loops are
heated and ﬁlled with hot plasma. A pair of newly formed rib-
bons are generated in the chromosphere.

In this study, the CRF was also triggered by an eruptive mini-
ﬁlament. During its initial rising phase, the ﬁlament pushed the
CLs aside and resulted in small-scale, pre-ﬂare dimming, which
could be observed only in 131 and 171 Å with formation tem-
peratures of log T ≈ 5.6 − 5.8 in the lower corona. After the
onset of CRF, the ﬁlament continued to ascend and dilate. How-
ever, the conﬁnement from the CLs was so strong that the ﬁl-
ament failed to evolve into a CME (Sun et al. 2015). Magnetic
reconnection between the EF and CLs may also heat the CLs to
high temperature observed in 94 Å. Meanwhile, the CLs were
continuously being pushed aside and underwent rapid expansion
in the southwest direction. Therefore, the large-area remote dim-
mings, which were associated with the negative footpoints (FP2)
of CLs, may result from density depletion of the CLs during their
expansion, which is consistent with the fact that large-area dim-
mings were observed in all EUV passbands except 304 Å.

In this work, we investigated the conﬁned M1.1 CRF trig-
gered by the eruption of a mini-ﬁlament without a CME on 2015
October 16. A few minutes before the ﬂare HXR peak time,
small-scale, weak dimming appeared ∼240′′ away from the ﬂare.
Such pre-ﬂare dimming was observed only in 131 and 171 Å. Af-
terwards, long and narrow dimmings became evident in all AIA
EUV wavelengths except 304 Å, while localized core dimming

was absent near the ﬂare site. The large-area dimmings extended
southeastward and the areas increased gradually. The total area
of remote dimmings reaches (1.2±0.4)×104 Mm2 in 193 Å. The
maximal relative intensity decreases in 171 and 193 Å reach 90%
and 80%, respectively. Subsequently, the dimmings began to re-
plenish and the area decreased slowly, lasting for ≥3 hr. The re-
mote dimmings and AR 12434 were connected by large-scale,
overlying CLs. The dimmings were associated with the south-
west footpoints of CLs with weak negative polarities. We pro-
pose that the remote coronal dimmings were probably created
by density depletion of the large-scale CLs.
