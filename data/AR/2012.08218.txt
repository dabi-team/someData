ABSTRACT

The visual STELLA ´echelle spectrograph (SES-VIS) is a new instrument for the STELLA-II telescope at the
Iza˜na observatory on Tenerife. Together with the original SES spectrograph - which will still be used in the
near IR - and a new H&K-optimized spectrograph, which is currently in the design phase, it will extend the
capabilities of STELLA with the follow up of planetary candidates from space missions (TESS, PLATO2).
SES-VIS is optimized for precise radial velocity determinations and long term stability. We have developed
a ZEMAX based software package to create simulated spectra, which are then extracted using our new data
reduction package developed for the PEPSI spectrograph. The focus in this paper has been put on calibration
spectra, and the full range of available calibration sources (ﬂat ﬁeld, Th-Ar, and Fabry-P´erot etalon), which
can be compared to actual commissioning data once they are available. Furthermore we tested for the eﬀect of
changes of the environmental parameters to the wavelength calibration precision.

1. INTRODUCTION

To measure precise radial velocities with a spectrograph essentially means to measure the position of the edges of
bright and dark features on the CCD. This is most obvious for calibration spectra, which are either line-spectra
from elements like Thorium, or artiﬁcial line spectra from a laser comb or a stabilized Fabry-P´erot etalon (FPE).
These edges can be determined approximately (depending on contrast) with an accuracy of 10% of the width of
a pixel, which is in case of a spectrograph with a resolving power of 5×104 approximately 100 m s−1. To reach
the goal of m s−1 accuracy, one needs many lines, in this case about 1×104. For calibration light sources, if
light sources like ThAr are not suﬃcient any more, laser combs or stabilized Fabry-P´erot etalons that can be
matched to the spectrograph parameters are the solution. For science observations, the only way to increase the
number of lines is the increase of the wavelength range, and to some extent for slowly rotating stars the increase
of spectral resolution. The actual factor deﬁning the radial velocity precision is the slope of the spectral lines.

Hatzes & Cochran1 used this fact to derive a formula for the expected radial velocity precision in terms of

spectral resolution, signal/noise ratio and wavelength coverage:

σ = 1.45 × 109(S/N )−1R−1B−1/2(m/s)

(1)

where S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, R the spectral resolution λ/∆λ, and B the spectral
coverage in ˚A. For the present case of SES-VIS with the parameters listed in Sect. 3, the expected precision from
this formula would only depend on S/N and would vary between 1 m/s for a S/N of 600 and 6 m/s for a S/N of
100.

A more stringent formula for the expected radial velocity precision has been derived by Bouchy et al. (2001),2
taking the spectral type and the broadening of the star into account in addition to S/N and spectral resolution.
A good recent summary of the various approaches has been written by Figueira (2018).3

2. FABRY-PEROT UNIT

Since a laser-comb calibration light source was out of reach when we started this project, we decided to build a
calibration source using a Fabry-P´erot etalon, similar to the one used in PEPSI. We used two oﬀ-axis parabolic
mirrors (OAPs), one to collimate the f/3 output of an optical ﬁber fed with halogen light, the other to re-focus
the beam onto a ﬁber which feeds the calibration light path of the spectrograph. For the ﬁrst OAP we used a
high-quality (λ/10) Zerodur mirror with broadband silver coating to make sure the etalon is well illuminated.
The second OAP was manufactured out of solid aluminum to match the properties of the ﬁrst OAP. The etalon
has a cavity size of 3.08 mm and a beam size of 25 mm, resulting in an eﬀective ﬁnesse (neglecting the aperture
ﬁnesse of the feed ﬁber) of 23 to 25 at our wavelength range of 470 nm to 690 nm.

The unit was built as a vacuum-compatible tube-structure (see Fig, 1 top), which will be put inside the
vacuum vessel of SES-VIS to keep the spectrum stable. A prototype was assembled at the AIP, aligned, and we

Unfortunately,
alignment problems of the laboratory spectrograph hindered us to make detailed analysis of the performance of
the etalon.

In total we will get about 175 FPE lines per order in all 42 orders of SES-VIS, resulting in about 7000 lines
in total. Assuming 100 m s−1accuracy per line, the calibration accuracy will achieve about 1 m s−1, matching the
best-case stellar radial velocity sensitivity derived above. In order to keep the wavelengths of the FPE-peaks
constant to better than 1 m s−1, the pressure stability inside the FPE must be better than 0.01 mbar.

3. THE SES-VIS SPECTROGRAPH

The new SES-VIS spectrograph was designed for the solar telescope GREGOR and known as GANS.4 It uses
a classical white pupil optical design. Its design goals were to measure precise radial velocities, it is therefore
contained inside a vacuum vessel for stability, which again is surrounded by an actively temperature-controlled
enclosure (Fig. 2). We use a R4-´echelle grating, with orders 89 - 130 for wavelengths from 468 nm to 691 nm.
In order to detect possible shifts between wavelength calibration exposures, a spectrum through a FPE is put
alongside all calibration and science exposures (Fig. 3). More details can be found in the presentation from SPIE
2018.5

500 mm, surrounded by two insulated enclosures. The volume between these two enclosures is actively kept at a constant
temperature. The whole unit is located in a commercially air-conditioned room.

4. SIMULATED SPECTRA

Using the optics design program Zemax we used the as-built optical design of SES-VIS to compute 2D-´echelle
spectra from standard one-dimensional spectra.6, 7 Recent versions of Zemax OpticStudio feature a well docu-
mented programming interface, which allows - among other things - to create standalone python programs that

use OpticStudio to trace rays. The python program reads in the model spectrum and the order list of GANS
specifying start and end wavelength for each spectral order that ﬁts on the detector surface. For each spec-
tral order, the ﬂux is divided into small wavelength chunks (matching the sampling of the spectrograph), and
each of these chunks is propagated through the spectrograph. The relative intensity is preserved by scaling the
propagated rays with the incoming intensity. The rays that end up at the detector surface are assigned to their
respective pixel, and the 2D-´echelle image is obtained after going through the complete order list. We use a fairly
high number of rays (10000) per sampling element (one pixel in dispersion direction), which are constructed by
uniformly distributing them across the ﬁeld (the optical ﬁbre diameter) and pupil of the spectrograph.

Our primary spectrum for all further analysis was a model spectrum of the sun. We used the solar atmosphere
model from MARCS,8 a line list from VALD39 and the Turbospectrum10 code to compute spectra the model
spectrum of the sun. After the model spectrum was broadened to account for rotation and macroturbulence, it
became our reference spectrum for further analysis.

To analyze the results we used our data reduction package SDS4PEPSI,11 extracting the spectral orders from
for both the science spectrum as well as the FPE-spectrum. For the purpose of data reduction we constructed ﬂat-
ﬁeld images from one model with a constant intensity, and wavelength reference images using a high-resolution
PEPSI11 ThAr spectrum (see Fig. 3).

During the analysis of our data it became clear that we need to add features to our data reduction package.
Currently it is not possible to supply a reference line list on the ﬂy, as would be necessary to use the positions
of the FPE-peaks to set the wavelengths of the FPE-spectrum. We overcame this limitations by using a ThAr-
Spectrum in place of the FPE reference spectrum. We will also measure this during commissioning of the
spectrograph, but during routine operations only light from the FPE-unit can be placed simultaneously onto the
detector. It is also not possible currently to use optimal extraction,12 since this fails on the FPE spectrum but
can not be turned oﬀ selectively for individual slices, and our simultaneous calibration spectrum is treated as an
extra slice. Solutions for these problems are under way and will be ready for lab-commissioning.

We created a set of simulated spectra to test the data analysis software, and to see up to what quality of the
vacuum the radial velocity can be derived at a nominal precision of about 1 m s−1, which is roughly our design
goal since at that resolution and wavelength range it is the best precision one can obtain from a well-behaved

stellar spectrum (see Sect. 1 above). Combinations are written as ThAR/FPE, meaning that ThAr-light was used
for the science orders, and FPE-light was used for the calibration orders. This set consisted of ﬂat ﬁeld spectra
in all combinations (Flat/zero, zero/Flat, Flat/Flat), ThAr-calibration spectra (ThAr/ThAr and Thar/FPE),
and s series of Sun/FPE spectra at pressure settings inside the vacuum vessel between 0.01 and 100 mbar.

We plan to run the vessel at a pressure of 10−4 mbar, but want to know at what level we would need to start
pumping in order to keep up our wavelength stability. The FPE is located in the same vacuum vessel, and a
calibration accuracy of 1 m s−1 demands a pressure stability of better than 0.01 mbar, otherwise changes in the
FPE-peak wavelengths would dictate the precision of the simultaneous calibration.

All spectra are extracted using standard extraction, the science and calibration spectra are treated as two
slices and are extracted together, and the wavelength solution is obtained using both spectra simultaneously also.
The spectra are then separated out into two sets of spectra, science spectra and calibration spectra, normalized
using per-order spline-ﬁts, and merged into single one-dimensional spectra. For simplicity we did not make
a global ﬁt to set the continuum, nor did we iterate the continuum to match the order-overlaps, thus small
continuum-errors are introduced during this procedure.

As our data reduction software is not yet capable of directly measuring the stability of the FPE-peaks’
positions, we independently derived the global shift of the solar spectrum using the extracted science spectra,
and of the FPE-spectrum using the extracted calibration spectra. We used the same spectra as cross-correlation

templates as we used as input for ray tracing. No additional noise was added to the images, the number of rays
traced corresponds to a S/N of about 100 per pixel.

Cross-correlation was carried out by a multi-purpose python script developed for merged STELLA and PEPSI
spectra. The template can optionally be spun up to an arbitrary rotational velocity, and macro-turbulence and
instrumental broadening can be folded in. Wavelength-regions of interest can be deﬁned that leave out regions
which are heavily aﬀected by telluric lines, or to leave out (or focus on) very strong lines like Balmer-lines or Na-D,
but here the whole spectral region was used. In a ﬁrst step both template and science spectrum are re-sampled to
a constant velocity step size and a regular correlation routine is used to obtain a ﬁrst approximation of the peak
position (top left of Fig. 4). In a second step, the natural sampling of the science spectrum is preserved, and the
template spectrum is evaluated at these sampling wavelengths. We then repeat this procedure for 5000 diﬀerent
velocity shifts, oﬀset each by 1 m s−1centered around the peak derived in the ﬁrst step, and derive the ﬁnal oﬀset
by a ﬁt to this function (top right of Fig. 4). In the bottom of Fig. 4 the science spectrum is shown along with the
shifted and broadened template spectrum. Naturally, since both are derived for the identical model spectrum,
they are very similar, but a small waviness in the continuum setting is visible as well as systematic diﬀerences
around strong lines.

Now, in the end, we ﬁnally get to compare the oﬀsets derived from both the science spectra as well as the
calibration spectra with respect to the vacuum-vessel’s pressure (Fig. 5). The oﬀsets stay constant up to 0.1 mbar,
and only an insigniﬁcant diﬀerence is visible at 1 mbar. From here onwards, the diﬀerences are much bigger than
the desired accuracy of the spectrograph, as was expected.

This experiment shows that we are on the safe side with our planned pressure level at 10−4 mbar. The
spectrograph itself tolerates two orders of magnitudes more than the FPE, which leaves some room for eﬀects
like residual temperature variations which are not covered here since we can not simulate them during lab-
commissioning due to the lack of space for the thermal enclosure. And the extra margin of two orders of
magnitude from our planned vacuum level of 10−4 mbar to a tolerable 0.01 mbar suggests that we can refrain
from pumping during the nights.
