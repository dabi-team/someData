It was recently pointed out that direct detection signals from at least three diﬀerent targets may
be used to determine whether the Dark Matter (DM) particle is diﬀerent from its antiparticle. In
this work, we examine in detail the feasibility of this test under diﬀerent conditions, motivated
by proposals for future detectors. Speciﬁcally, we perform likelihood ﬁts to mock data under the
hypotheses that the DM particle is identical to or diﬀerent from its antiparticle, and determine the
signiﬁcance with which the former can be rejected in favor of the latter. In our analysis, we consider
3 diﬀerent values of the DM mass (50 GeV, 300 GeV, 1 TeV) and 4 diﬀerent experimental ensembles,
each consisting of at least 3 diﬀerent targets – Xe and Ar plus one among the following: Si, Ge,
CaWO4, or Ge/CaWO4. For each of these experimental ensembles and each DM mass, the expected
discrimination signiﬁcance is calculated as a function of the DM-nucleon couplings. In the best case
scenario, the discrimination signiﬁcance can exceed O(3σ) for three of the four ensembles considered,
reaching O(5σ) at special values of the DM-nucleon couplings. For the ensemble including Si, O(5σ)
signiﬁcance can be achieved for a range of DM masses and over a much wider range of DM-nucleon
couplings, highlighting the need for a variety of experimental targets in order to determine the DM
properties. These results show that future direct detection signals could be used to exclude, at
a statistically signiﬁcant level, a Majorana or a real DM particle, giving a critical clue about the
identity of the Dark Matter.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of Dark Matter (DM) poses one of
the most challenging problems in cosmology, particle and
astroparticle physics [1]. Robust and generally accepted
solutions to the DM problem imply that a new parti-
cle provides the necessary energy density. The goal is
then to determine the fundamental properties of this new
particle, and to do so it must ﬁrst be detected by non-
gravitational means. A promising way to detect the dark
matter particle is to observe its scattering with a target
material in terrestrial detectors – dubbed direct detection
[2, 3].

In recent years, direct detection experiments have sig-
niﬁcantly improved the constraints on the DM-nucleon
scattering cross section [4–11], but no deﬁnitive signal
has yet been observed. This year a new generation of di-
rect detection experiments, with a target mass of order 1
ton, has entered into play and has already started prob-
ing new regions of the parameter space [12], opening the
possibility of observing a DM signal in the near future.

Once such signals are detected, it remains the task of
extracting from them, and possibly in combination with
signals from other experiments, the fundamental proper-
ties of the DM particle [13–17]. One of these properties,
which has not received much attention, is the nature of
the DM antiparticle. Is the DM its own antiparticle, as
is the case for a Majorana fermion and for a real scalar
or vector? Or is it a diﬀerent particle, as is the case for
a Dirac fermion and for a complex scalar or vector?

In a recent paper, a test that addresses precisely these
questions was proposed [18] (hereafter QRY17). This
test, which is based on direct detection data only, requires
the observation of spin-independent signals in three dif-
ferent targets and allows one to exclude a DM particle
that is self-conjugate (i.e. which is its own antiparticle).
The crucial observation is that, for self-conjugate DM,
the spin-independent scattering cross sections oﬀ nuclei
depend on just two couplings, which determine the DM
interaction with the proton and with the neutron. For
DM that is not self-conjugate, there are instead four fun-
damental couplings (or more precisely three measurable
parameters, as we will show), which determine the inter-
actions of the dark matter particle and of its antiparticle
with the proton and with the neutron. Thus, if signals
are observed in more than two experiments with diﬀer-
ent targets, one may ﬁnd that the interpretation with
just two coupling parameters is inconsistent, and conse-

 
 
 
 
 
 
quently that the DM particle can not be its own antipar-
ticle.

In this paper we will perform a much more sophisti-
cated analysis than that presented in QRY17, where only
rough estimates were made of the experimental precision
required to show the Dirac nature of DM. Here we in-
stead simulate direct detection data from diﬀerent targets
based on projections for several experiments which may
enter into operation in the near future. In addition, we
implement a likelihood analysis, which allows us to prop-
erly combine the data from diﬀerent experiments and to
determine the precise statistical signiﬁcance with which a
DM particle which is self-conjugate can be discriminated
from one which is not. We compute this discrimination
signiﬁcance for diﬀerent sets of possible experiments, for
several values of the DM mass and for diﬀerent under-
lying DM-nucleon couplings. This allows us to highlight
which experimental ensembles will be most eﬀective at
excluding self-conjugate DM and for which couplings this
is feasible.

In the next section, we review the test proposed in
QRY17, as it applies to a fermion DM particle, and intro-
duce the basic notation to be used throughout the paper.
The standard direct detection formalism is introduced in
Sec. III while the four diﬀerent sets (ensembles) of ex-
periments that are part of our analysis are presented in
Sec. IV. Section V explains in detail the statistical pro-
cedure that we use to study the feasibility of the test,
with the more technical details relegated to the appen-
dices. Our main results are described in Sec. VI, in which
we present the discrimination signiﬁcance obtained with
four diﬀerent experimental ensembles, for several values
of the DM mass. Finally, we discuss and summarize our
key ﬁndings in Sec. VII and Sec. VIII.

also take into account the translation of the fundamental
quark-level Lagrangian to the hadronic level [20–22]. The
subscript e (o) implies that the operator is even (odd) un-
der the interchange of χ and ¯χ. For Majorana particles,
the odd terms are absent, and the cross section2 for DM

by λN,e + λN,o ≡ 2λD
N . A Dirac antiparticle would again
have the same cross section, but with λN,e replaced by
λN,e − λN,o ≡ 2λD

contribute equally to the observed DM density, as ex-
pected in the standard freeze-out scenario [24], the total
cross section with nucleons is the average of the particle
and antiparticle cross sections:

Here we review the test proposed in QRY17 for de-
termining whether DM is its own antiparticle. This test
works in exactly the same way for scalar, fermion or vec-
tor DM. For deﬁniteness, then, we will consider fermion
DM throughout our analysis but it should be kept in
mind that our results do not rely on such an assumption.
Our starting point is then the most general Lagrangian

1 Spin-independent interactions which are higher order in the DM
velocity are of course possible. However, for DM speeds of v ∼
10−3, these will typically be subdominant. We brieﬂy discuss
this further in Sec. VII.

2 in the zero-momentum transfer limit

The three parameters (λp, λn, f ), with f ∈ [−1, 1] are all
that are needed to describe the Dirac DM-nucleus cross

section given in Eq. (3). There is therefore a degener-
acy between the DM-nucleon couplings (λD
n ),
which cannot be broken by direct detection experiments.
Without loss of generality, we set λD
p = 0 throughout this
work.

p , λD

n , λD

p , λD

A comparison of Eq. (2) and Eq. (7) makes manifestly
clear that the scattering cross sections for Dirac and Ma-
jorana DM can have diﬀerent dependences on the number
of protons and neutrons in the target nucleus. This is the
basis of the test proposed in QRY17; with positive signals
in at least three diﬀerent experimental targets, one can
determine whether this dependence is consistent with a
Majorana particle (as in Eq. (2)) or a Dirac particle (as
in Eq. (7)).

p = λp and λM

Notice that for f = ±1 the Dirac cross section in
SI ∝ [λpNp ± λnNn]2, which
Eq. (7) takes the form σD
is equivalent to the Majorana cross section (Eq. (2))
through the identiﬁcation λM
n = ±λn. The
Majorana cross section can thus be recovered as a spe-
cial case of the Dirac one with the implication that in this
case direct detection experiments could never determine,
even in principle, that the dark matter is a Majorana par-
ticle. For f (cid:54)= ±1, however, experiments could exclude
this possibility, establishing the DM as a Dirac particle.
Let us brieﬂy describe some special cases where f hap-
pens to be equal to ±1 and Dirac and Majorana DM
cannot be distinguished. The ﬁrst case occurs when
the DM fermion has only scalar or vector interactions,
i.e. λp,e = λn,e = 0 or λp,o = λn,o = 0; both types
of interactions should consequently be present to allow
any discrimination. The second case occurs when the
cross section of the particle or the antiparticle vanishes
(λp,e +λp,o = λn,e +λn,o = 0 or λp,e −λp,o = λn,e −λn,o =
0). The value f = ±1 is also obtained when the ra-
tio between the coupling to the proton and to the neu-
tron is the same for the DM particle and the antiparti-
cle: λD
p . A ﬁnal example is a DM par-
ticle that couples only to protons or only to neutrons,
λn,e = λn,o = 0 or λp,e = λp,o = 0, which leads to λn = 0
or λp = 0, respectively. Thus, over the multi-dimensional
parameter space of the DM couplings, which consists of
(λD
n ), there exists a number of special regions
where the test proposed in QRY17 is inconclusive from
a theoretical point of view and that independent of the
available experimental data. Outside those regions – that
is, over most of the parameter space – the test is in prin-
ciple feasible, but it may be limited by the targets that
can realistically be used in direct detection experiments
and by the precision that can be reached in such exper-
iments. These issues will be analyzed in detail in this
work.

A diﬃculty already observed in QRY17 is that the
three targets required to exclude a Majorana DM par-
ticle must diﬀer in their ratios Np/Nn (number of pro-
tons/number of neutrons). However, this quantity does
not vary much for stable nuclei. As a result, the dis-
crepancy between σM
SI tends to be small and can

often be accounted for by the uncertainties on the mea-
sured cross sections. As discussed in Appendix B, this is
not necessarily the case in regions of the parameter space
where there is a partial cancellation between the proton
and neutron contributions to the DM cross section oﬀ a
given target. It is in such regions where the discrimina-
tion sensitivity will be maximized. This partial cancella-
tion occurs, according to Eq. (7), when f is close to −1
and when λn/λp ≈ Np/Nn for one of the experimental
targets. In this work, we map out this parameter space
more precisely, by quantifying the statistical signiﬁcance
with which Dirac and Majorana DM can be discriminated
as a function of λp, λn and f .

III. DIRECT DETECTION EVENT RATE

In order to put the method of the previous section into
practice, we must ﬁrst set out the formalism for calculat-
ing the event rate in direct detection experiments, from
which the DM-nucleon couplings are to be estimated.
The expected rate of nuclear recoils R per unit nuclear
recoil energy ER is obtained by convolving the DM ﬂux
with the DM-nucleus diﬀerential cross section dσχA/dER
[25]

Here, we have allowed for the possibility that the detector
is composed of several diﬀerent nuclei with mass fractions
XA.

We ﬁx the local DM density to the canonical value of
ρχ = 0.3 GeV cm−3, though we note that observational
estimates are typically in the range 0.2–0.8 GeV cm−3
(for a review, see Ref. [26]). We assume that the local DM
population is well described by the Standard Halo Model
(SHM), leading to an isotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann speed
distribution f (v) (see for instance Eq. (18) of Ref. [27]).
We assume a speed dispersion σv = 156 km s−1 and take
the relative speed of the Earth with respect to the halo
as vEarth = 232 km s−1 [28–30], which we assume con-
stant. The speed distribution (in the Galactic frame) is
truncated at the local escape speed of the Milky Way
vesc ≈ 544 km s−1 [31, 32]. We integrate over all speeds
v > vmin, the minimum DM speed required to produce a
nuclear recoil with energy ER:

and σA is the DM-nucleus cross section at zero momen-
tum transfer. The exact form of σA is given in Eq. (2) for
Majorana DM and in Eq. (3) for Dirac DM (taking into
account the averaging over particles and antiparticles).

in the next section.

IV. MOCK EXPERIMENTS

In order to study the power of future experiments to
discriminate between Dirac and Majorana Dark Matter
we consider the ﬁve mock experiments detailed in Ta-
ble I. They are largely based on proposed experiments
which can be expected to be taking data and releasing
results during the period 2020-2025. Each mock experi-
ment is described by the range of recoil energies used for
the analysis ER ∈ [Emin, Emax] and the total exposure in
ton-years. We assume a constant (energy-independent)
signal eﬃciency of 70% for all experiments and zero back-
grounds. In some cases, this assumption is reasonable;
the Argon-based DarkSide-50 detector [6], for example,
has demonstrated background-free capabilities. In other
cases, this assumption will be overly optimistic, but al-
lows us to explore a ‘best-case’ scenario, without refer-
ence to the ﬁnal background properties of a given detec-
tor.

For the Xe detector, we take the exposure from the
XENONnT proposals [37] (∼ 6 ton × 3 yr). As with
all the experiments we consider, the energy threshold is
hard to predict as it will depend on the ﬁnal detector
performance once operational. We therefore estimate re-
alistic benchmark values for each experiment. For the Xe
detector, we choose a value intermediate between the LZ
conceptual design report [35] and the LUX 2015 anal-
ysis [9]. The DARWIN proposal [42] for an ‘ultimate

DM detector’ will provide an even larger exposure than
XENONnT. However, as we will show, the discrimina-
tion power is driven mostly by the variety of targets in
use, so we will not consider this larger Xenon exposure
here.

For the Ar detector, we take the exposure from DEAP-
50T [39] (50 ton × 3 yr) and the approximate threshold
from DarkSide-50 [6].

For Ge and CaWO4, we take the EURECA phase 2 [40]
proposals. In Tab. I, we assume that the full EURECA
target mass is accounted for by one or the other target.
In reality, the plan is for a 50:50 mass split, which is
accounted for in one of the experimental ensembles listed
below (ensemble D).

For the case of a Si experiment, we take the energy
thresholds from the CDMS-II Silicon detectors [41]. We
consider an exposure similar to that of EURECA phase
2 (1 ton × 3 yr), despite the fact that the EURECA
project does not include plans for a Si detector. The
reason we include in our analysis an experiment which
is not currently planned is that, as observed in QRY17,
Si seems to be ideal for our purposes given that its ra-
tio Np/Nn = 1 is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the other
targets, which are summarized in Tab. II. Note that for
numerical reasons (see Appendix A), we assume each tar-
get nucleus is composed of a single isotope. As we show
later, experiments with a relatively wide range of Np/Nn
are required to allow good discrimination, so we do not
expect small variations in A between diﬀerent isotopes
to have a large impact on our results. Indeed, we have
checked explicitly that this approximation leads only to
an O(10%) shift in the discrimination signiﬁcance.

Let us also note here that there are also proposals for
direct detection experiments based on nuclear emulsions
(see e.g. Ref. [43]). Among the target elements in that
case are C, O and H, which (to good precision) have
Np/Nn = 1 in their natural abundance, and would thus
also be good candidates to contribute to the test of DM
self-conjugacy studied here.

To discriminate Dirac from Majorana DM, data from
at least three diﬀerent targets is required. In our analy-
sis, we will examine 4 diﬀerent ensembles of mock exper-
iments:

Ensemble A: Xe + Ar + Si,

Ensemble B: Xe + Ar + Ge,

Ensemble C: Xe + Ar + CaWO4,

Ensemble D: Xe + Ar + 50% Ge + 50% CaWO4.

All ensembles include Xe and Ar because currently they
are the most promising large scale targets for the de-
tection of a DM signal. Let us emphasize that ensem-
ble D corresponds to the combination of the XENONnT,
DEAP-50T and EURECA phase 2 experiments3 and is
therefore closest to the current plans for future detectors.

V. STATISTICAL PROCEDURE

p , λD

p , λD

For a given experimental ensemble, we want to evalu-
ate the median (Dirac vs. Majorana) discrimination sig-
niﬁcance which can be achieved for a range of underlying
DM parameters, speciﬁed by (mχ, λD
n , λD
n ). In
fact, as discussed in Sec. II, we are free to set λD
p = 0
without loss of generality. We also ﬁx the overall normal-
ization of the couplings to lie just below the ﬁnal LUX
bounds [9]. In practice, we choose the couplings to give
a total DM-Xenon cross section which is equivalent to a
standard isospin conserving DM-proton cross section of
10−46 cm2 at a DM mass of 50 GeV. This ﬁxes the num-
ber of expected DM signal events in our mock Xenon
experiment (∼ 315 events, which we keep the same for
all DM masses) and thus ensures that the LUX bounds
are always respected4. We also verify that bounds from
Ar- and Ge-based experiments are not exceeded [6, 44].
At a given mass, each input parameter point can then
be speciﬁed by just two parameters: λn/λp and f . At
each parameter point, we generate a set of mock data for
the experimental ensemble under consideration. We then
calculate the maximum likelihood of obtaining the data
under two hypotheses:

HM : Majorana-like DM, with free parameters:
Θ = (mχ, λp, λn, f = ±1),

HD: Dirac-like DM, with free parameters:
Θ = (mχ, λp, λn, f ∈ [−1, 1]).

We use a background-free extended likelihood which

for experiment k is given by:

Lk(Θ) =

e−Ne(Θ)
No!

Ne(Θ)No

No(cid:89)

i=1

P (E(i)

R |Θ) ,

(12)

3 The ‘50%’ indicates that for Ge and CaWO4 we take 50% of the

nominal exposure given in Tab. I.

4 During the preparation of this work, the ﬁrst results of the
XENON1T experiment were released [12]. The benchmark
cross sections used in this work are still compatible with the
XENON1T bounds at approximately the 95% conﬁdence level.

where No is the number of observed events in experi-
ment k, with recoil energies {E(1)
R }. Given the
parameters Θ, Ne is the total number of expected events
in experiment k and P (ER, Θ) is the probability of mea-
suring an event of energy ER. The full likelihood is then
the product over all of the experiments considered:

R , ..., E(No)

L(Θ) =

Nexpt
(cid:89)

k

Lk(Θ) .

(13)

The maximum likelihood under each hypothesis was de-
termined by sampling the parameters (λp, λn, f ) on a
grid. The procedure is described in detail in Appendix A.
We note that the likelihood can be highly multimodal
with pronounced degeneracies, so calculation of the max-
imum likelihood is non-trivial. We have made the code
for calculating the maximum likelihood (and analysing
the results) available online [45].

Once obtained, we compare the maximum likelihood
under the two hypotheses, ˆLM and ˆLD, by constructing
the test statistic:

q = −2(log ˆLM − log ˆLD) .

(14)

Under the hypothesis HM , the test statistic q should be
asymptotically half chi-square distributed [46] with one
degree of freedom5. This allows us to calculate a p-value
for the observed value of q and hence determine the sig-
niﬁcance with which HM can be rejected in favour of
HD.

For each parameter point, we generate 100 mock data
sets and calculate the discrimination signiﬁcance for each
one. This accounts for the eﬀects of Poisson noise and
allows us to determine the median discrimination signiﬁ-
cance expected in future experiments (i.e. the signiﬁcance
we would expect to achieve in at least 50% of realisa-
tions).

As already discussed in Sec. II, discrimination between
Dirac and Majorana particles is expected to be max-
imised when there is some partial cancellation in the cross
section for DM scattering of one of the target nuclei. In
Appendix B, we estimate analytically which values of the
DM couplings will allow for signiﬁcant discrimination.
With this in mind, we restrict ourselves to the following
range of input parameter values: λn/λp ∈ [0.5, 1.0] and
f ∈ [−1.00, −0.94]. For a given mass and experimental
ensemble, we calculate the median discrimination signif-
icance over a grid in these input couplings.

VI. RESULTS

Let us now display our main results. Figures 1-4 show,
in the plane (f, λn/λp), the median expected discrimi-

sembles we consider and for dark matter masses of 50
GeV (left panel), 300 GeV (middle panel) and 1 TeV
(right panel). In each panel, the value of the discrimi-
nation signiﬁcance is color-coded: white regions have a
discrimination signiﬁcance of < 1σ, with darker colors
corresponding to larger signiﬁcance. The point with the
highest signiﬁcance is marked with a star. Labeled on the
upper x-axis are the values of |λD
n | corresponding to a
given value of f , assuming λD
p = 0. The dashed horizon-
tal lines correspond to the region where λn/λp = Np/Nn
for each nucleus (see Tab. II). At the point where those
lines intersect the line f = −1 (the left axis) the expected
signal is zero for that nucleus. As we will see, the regions
with high discrimination signiﬁcance are always close to
one of those points.

n /λD

In Fig. 1 we show results for ensemble A, which consists
of (Xe+Ar+Si). From the ﬁgures we can see that the
1σ regions span a limited region of the parameter space,
−1 < f < 0.94 and 0.65 < λn/λp < 0.95, with a very
mild dependence on the dark matter mass. Only within
such regions it is possible to exclude a Majorana (or self-
conjugate) DM particle. These results are in agreement
with the analytic estimates of Appendix B (see Fig. 7)
and we ﬁnd no other regions of the parameter space where
a signiﬁcant discrimination is possible.

For a dark matter mass of 50 GeV (left panel), the
maximum discrimination signiﬁcance is 4.8σ, which is
reached for f ≈ −0.995 and λn/λp ≈ −0.8. For
mχ = 300 GeV and mχ = 1 TeV, the maximum dis-
crimination signiﬁcance increases to 5.5σ and 5.7σ (most

likely due to the increasing number of Argon events rel-
ative to Xenon at higher masses) and the point where it
is reached remains close to the horizontal dashed line for
Argon (where cancellation of the cross section is expected
in the Argon detector).

Figure 2 displays the discrimination signiﬁcance for en-
semble B, which consists of (Xe+Ar+Ge). In this case,
the 1σ regions are signiﬁcantly smaller, hardly extending
to f > −0.99. The maximum discrimination signiﬁcance
is found to be 3.1σ, achieved for a dark matter mass of
300 GeV. At 1 TeV the result is similar (3.0σ) whereas
it is smaller for 50 GeV (2.6σ). For all three masses,
the maximum discrimination signiﬁcance is reached for f
very close to −1 and for λn/λp between 0.7 and 0.8. The
lower discrimination signiﬁcance for ensemble B (com-
pared to ensemble A) is as expected. From Tab. II, we
can see that the proton-to-neutron ratios in Germanium
and Argon are relatively similar, making discrimination
more diﬃcult.

(Xe + Ar + CaWO4) are displayed. In this case, the 1σ
regions are a bit wider, extending up to f ≈ −0.98. This
improvement compared to ensemble B is to be expected,
owing to the wider range of nuclei in the CaWO4 target.
The maximum discrimination signiﬁcance is 5.8σ and
it is reached for a dark matter mass of 300 GeV. For
1 TeV, the maximum discrimination signiﬁcance is
similar (5.5σ), whereas it is a little smaller for 50 GeV
(4.9σ). Notice from the ﬁgure that for all three masses
the maximum discrimination signiﬁcance is reached
very close to the xenon-phobic point: λn/λp = 0.7
and λ = −1. Because we ﬁx the normalisation of the

couplings to give a ﬁxed number of events (∼ 315)
in our Xenon mock detector, the xenon-phobic point
corresponds to large couplings and large numbers of
events in the other detectors of the ensemble. Close
to this point, the DM-nucleon couplings can therefore
be constrained with greater precision, allowing some
discrimination between Dirac and Majorana DM. As we
move away from this point, however, we see that typical
discrimination signiﬁcances are slightly lower,
in the
range 3–4σ.

Figure 4 shows our results for the last ensemble in our
analysis (D), which consists of (Xe + Ar + Ge/CaWO4))
and is perhaps the closest to current plans for future
experiments. The regions where 1σ discrimination is
possible are slightly smaller than in the previous en-

semble. Part of the CaWO4 target mass has now been
traded for Ge which, as discussed, has a similar proton-
to-neutron ratio as Argon and therefore makes discrimi-
nation harder. The maximum discrimination signiﬁcance
reaches 4.6σ for a dark matter mass of 1 TeV, and de-
creases to 4.5σ and 3.9σ for 300 GeV and 50 GeV respec-
tively. As in the case of ensemble C, however, we note
that such high signiﬁcance is only achieve very close to
the xenon-phobic point. The red squares in the left panel
of this ﬁgure correspond to the parameter space points
which we will examine further in Fig. 5.

ination signiﬁcance is presented in Tab. III. In it, one

a given DM mass. For completeness, we have included
in this table also a DM mass of 25 GeV, which was not
shown in the previous ﬁgures. Note that in each case
we have ‘maximised’ over the values of λn/λp and f . As
can be seen in that table, the discrimination signiﬁcance
tends to be higher for heavier dark matter particles. In-
terestingly, we ﬁnd that for ensemble B the maximum
signiﬁcance is of order 3σ if the dark matter mass is
greater than or equal to 300 GeV. For ensembles C and
D, with the addition of CaWO4, the results are more en-
couraging with maximum signiﬁcances greater than 4σ
for DM masses above 50 GeV. However, in these cases
the signiﬁcance drops very rapidly away from the maxi-
mum, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Instead, for ensemble A,
which includes an Si target, a signiﬁcance greater than
4σ can be achieved for all DM masses studied and indeed
over a greater range of the parameter space, as shown in
Fig. 1. As had been anticipated in QRY17, where a much
simpler analysis was used, the observation of signals in
Xe+Ar+Si oﬀers the best prospects for the exclusion of
a Majorana (or real) dark matter particle.

So far, we have considered the exposure of the diﬀer-
ent experiments to be ﬁxed according to Table I. It is
also interesting, however, to analyze how the discrimi-
nation signiﬁcance changes with the exposure at a spe-
ciﬁc parameter space point. In Fig. 5, we show results
for ensemble A (Xe+Ar+Si, Green) as a function of the
Si exposure and for ensemble D (Xe + Ar + 50% Ge
+ 50% CaWO4, Blue) as a function of the combined
Ge + CaWO4 exposure.
In both cases, we ﬁx the Xe
and Ar exposures to those given in Tab. I but leave the
other exposure free. We select parameter points where
both ensembles are expected to achieve some discrimina-
tion: λn/λp = 0.75, 0.80; f = −0.995, and mχ = 50 GeV
(the red squares in Fig. 4). The vertical dashed lines

correspond to an exposure of 3 ton-years, which is the
benchmark from Tab. I.

As expected, the discrimination signiﬁcance increases
with the exposure. Even at low exposures, discrimination
is much easier with the Si experiment. For the coupling
ratio λn/λp = 0.75 (left panel), the gap between the per-
formance of the two ensembles remains roughly constant.
Instead, for the coupling ratio λn/λp = 0.8 (right panel),
the gap widens, with the discrimination signiﬁcance us-
ing ensemble D growing more slowly with exposure. This
behaviour can be understood in the language of QRY17
[18], in which each experiment can be seen as providing
a measurement of the Majorana DM-nucleus cross sec-
tion (Eq. (2)). Each such measurement (with associated
uncertainties) can then be translated into a region of pa-
rameter space in (λM
n ). The data is compatible with
a Majorana-like DM particle if the regions obtained from
multiple experiments overlap in (λM
n ). By increas-
ing the exposure of a given experiment, we reduce the
size of the region in (λM
n ) which is compatible with

that experiment. At some point, the size of this region
becomes much smaller than the region compatible with
the remaining experiments. Further increasing the ex-
posure will not improve the discrimination substantially,
as the uncertainties are driven instead by the remaining
experiments (e.g. Xe and Ar).

In the case of ensemble D, when the ratio of couplings
λn/λp = 0.8 is close to the proton-to-neutron ratio of
both Ar and Ge (right panel). There is a partial cancella-
tion of the cross section in both Ar and Ge, meaning that

the consistent regions for both experiments in (λM
n )
will be roughly degenerate. After a certain point, increas-
ing the Ge exposure does little to break the degeneracy
with Ar. The increase in discrimination signiﬁcance then
slows, driven only by the increasing CaWO4 exposure.
However, we emphasize that this eﬀect does not set in
until very large exposures are reached.

More quantitatively, from Fig. 5 it can be seen that,
for Si, achieving a 5σ discrimination signiﬁcance would
require exposures of about 4 ton-years for both of the pa-
rameters points in the left and right panels. For the com-
bined Ge + CaWO4, a 3σ discrimination signiﬁcance is
reached after about 5 and 15 ton-years, for λn/λp = 0.75
and λn/λp = 0.8 respectively. These ﬁgures show that
with the right combination of targets, the discrimination
signiﬁcance can continue to grow rapidly with exposure.
This suggests that once signals are observed in direct
detection experiments, there is a scientiﬁc case to keep
them running beyond the 2 or 3 years that is currently
the standard.

VII. DISCUSSION

As we have seen, discriminating between Dirac and
Majorana dark matter is only feasible when the DM
couplings lead to partial cancellations between the neu-
tron and the proton contributions to the cross section
oﬀ a nucleus –that is, for isospin-violating dark matter.
Isospin-violating dark matter generically denotes a sce-
nario where the dark matter couples diﬀerently to pro-
tons and neutrons, but it is the possibility of cancella-
tions between their contributions that makes it partic-
ularly interesting [47–49]. These cancellations have, in
fact, received a lot of attention over the past several years
[49–52]. Some explicit models for isospin-violating dark
matter were studied in Refs. [53–56] while experimen-
tal constraints on these scenarios were reported (among
others) in Refs. [57–61]. Thus, the cancellations that are
required for the test to be practical have been studied
before in other contexts and explicit models have been
constructed where they take place.

The results derived in the previous section are, to a
large extent, model-independent and can, therefore, be
directly applied to any speciﬁc particle physics model of
dark matter.
In such a model, the parameters λp, λn
and f will not be fundamental but would be written in
terms of some characteristic couplings and mass scales.
To assess the prospects for excluding a Majorana dark
matter particle in a given model, the ﬁrst step would
then be to determine the allowed regions for λp, λn, and
f , and then to compare them with the favorable regions
we found in ﬁgures 1-4. The larger the overlap between
them, the better the prospects for exclusion.

In Fig. 6, we provide an illustration of how the pa-

antiparticles is the same. That is certainly what is ex-
pected in the standard freeze-out scenario, but it is not
diﬃcult to imagine alternatives, such as asymmetric dark
matter, where it does not hold. In the more general case,
one would need an additional parameter that determines
the fraction of the dark matter density that is accounted
for by DM antiparticles. We have also assumed that the
dark matter consists of a single ﬁeld with predominantly
spin-independent interactions. In scenarios with multi-
component dark matter (see for example Ref. [62] and
references therein) or non-standard interactions (see for
example Ref. [63] and references therein), a more compli-
cated analysis would be required. In such cases, we em-
phasize that an even greater variety of direct detection
targets would likely be required to disentangle particle
from antiparticle.

On the astrophysical side, we have not taken into ac-
count the uncertainties that aﬀect the number of ex-
pected events in a given detector. For simplicity, we con-
sidered a single ﬁxed DM speed distribution f (v), the
SHM, but in reality not only are the parameters of the
SHM subject to uncertainties [64] but there are also in-
dications that the true distribution may deviate from a
smooth Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The evidence
for such deviations from hydrodynamical simulations is
reviewed in Ref. [65]. A number of techniques for si-
multaneously ﬁtting particle physics parameters and the
local speed distribution have been developed (see, for ex-
ample, Refs. [66–69]). Incorporating such astrophysical
uncertainties into the present study, we would expect
the discrimination signiﬁcance to be reduced, owing to
a greater freedom to tune the number of events observed
in each detector. The present results should therefore be
taken as an optimistic case. However, we note that for
relatively light DM (mχ (cid:46) 100 GeV), using an ensemble
of experiments with a range of nuclear masses should al-
low the speed distribution (as well as the DM mass and
cross sections) to be well constrained [27]. In that case,
we expect our results to be rather realistic.

VIII. SUMMARY

In this work we investigated in detail the feasibil-
ity of distinguishing dark matter particles that are self-
conjugate (Majorana fermion and real scalar or vector)
from those that are not (Dirac fermion and complex
scalar or vector) using future signals from direct detection
experiments. To that end, we ﬁrst simulated data from
diﬀerent direct detection experiments that may enter into
operation in the near future. Then, we performed ﬁts to
such data under the hypotheses that the DM is identi-
cal to or diﬀerent from its antiparticle, and determine
the signiﬁcance with which the former can be rejected in
favor of the latter. This discrimination signiﬁcance was
calculated, as a function of the DM couplings, for diﬀer-
ent experimental ensembles and several values of the DM
mass. Our results are illustrated in Figs. 1-5 and sum-

FIG. 6. Relationship between Lagrangian couplings
and observable parameters f , λp and λn. Random
sample of points in the parameter space λp,e, λp,o, λn,e,
λn,o (see Eq. (1)) which satisfy f ∈ [−0.995, −0.985] and
λn/λp ∈ [0.7, 0.8] (see Eqs. (4)–(6)). The points shown here
therefore correspond to a region of parameter space where dis-
crimination between Dirac and Majorana DM is most promis-
ing. We ﬁx λn,o = 1 (which simply ﬁxes the overall normalisa-
tion of the couplings) and color each point by the value of λp,o.
The dashed diagonal line corresponds to λn,e/λp,e = 0.75.

rameters λp, λn, and f relate to the more fundamen-
tal couplings λN,e and λN,o which appear in the La-
grangian of Eq. (1). For parameters in the range f ∈
[−0.995, −0.985] and λn/λp ∈ [0.7, 0.8] (a region where
good discrimination is expected, see ﬁgures 1-4), we
plot the corresponding Lagrangian-level couplings (ﬁxing
λn,o = 1 in order to ﬁx the overall normalisation). These
points are aligned along two lines in the parameter space
(λp,e, λp,o, λn,e) whose slope is determined by the desired
ratio of couplings to protons and neutrons6 For given val-
ues of λn/λp and f , the couplings must be chosen to lie
on one of these lines. However, we note that this does not
require any hierarchy between the diﬀerent couplings. As
shown in Fig. 6, it should be possible to achieve a sig-
niﬁcant discrimination with all couplings of order unity
(up to some overall normalisation). This corresponds to
each of the spin-independent interactions in Eq. (1) con-
tributing roughly equally. This also means that we do
not expect the presence of subdominant (e.g. velocity
suppressed) interactions to aﬀect the results presented
here, unless their couplings are suﬃciently enhanced so
as to be comparable to the standard spin-independent
rate.

Let us now brieﬂy discuss some caveats to our conclu-
sions. On the theoretical side, our results rely on the
assumption that the density of dark matter particles and

are as follows:

• It is feasible to use signals from future direct de-
tection experiments to exclude, at a statistically
signiﬁcant level, a Majorana or a real DM particle.

• Discrimination between Dirac and Majorana DM
(or between real and complex DM) can be achieved
only in certain regions of the parameter space.
Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed as the most promising re-
gion that one where the DM couplings lead to a
partial cancellation in the DM-nucleus cross sec-
tion for one of the experimental targets. That is,
for f ≈ −1 and λn/λp ∈ (0.7, 0.8) (see Eq. 4-6 for
deﬁnitions).
In Figs. 1-4 we focused precisely on
such regions.

• According to current plans for future detectors (our
ensemble D), the maximum discrimination signiﬁ-
cance that could be achieved is around 4-5σ, and
depends only slightly on the dark matter mass.
However, this is possible only very close to the
xenon-phobic point in parameter space, dropping
to roughly 3σ away from this point.

• A Silicon target, which does not currently ﬁgure
among future detectors, could help achieve up to
5σ discrimination signiﬁcance over a wider range of
the parameter space, for an exposure similar to that
of EURECA phase 2. We therefore propose that
large-scale Silicon detectors should be considered as
part of plans for future detectors such as EURECA.

• The discrimination signiﬁcance does not ﬂatten
quickly as a function of the exposure. Conse-
quently, once direct detection signals are observed,
it may be worthwhile to keep the experiments run-
ning beyond the 2 or 3 years that are currently
planned.

Sec. V. In order to perform a large number of ﬁts (100
scans per parameter point, over a grid of 1024 input pa-
rameter values, for several experimental ensembles), it is
necessary to determine the maximum likelihood quickly
and with high accuracy. We have found that Markov
Chain Monte Carlo and Nested Sampling methods (with
a relatively small number of samples, as required for a
fast exploration of the parameter space) often fail to ﬁnd
the global maximum in the multi-modal likelihoods con-
sidered here. We instead sample the likelihood on a grid.
As demonstrated in Eq. (7), the spin-independent DM-
nucleus cross section for Dirac DM can be described
with 3 parameters: λp, λn and f . The parameters λp,n
may take any positive values, but (from its deﬁnition in
Eq. (6)) we require f ∈ [−1, 1]. Note that a Majorana-
like cross section is a special case of this with f = ±1.

For a given DM mass, the recoil energy spectrum for
scattering oﬀ a given nucleus is ﬁxed. In this case, the
log-likelihood is given by:

log L = −Ne + No log(Ne) +

No(cid:88)

i=1

log(P (E(i)

R )) ,

(A1)

where P (ER) does not depend on the couplings. In this
case, the log-likelihood can be calculated very quickly on
a dense grid over the couplings, which only aﬀect the
value of Ne.7 If an experiment consists of multiple tar-
gets, the likelihood is

where N k

and the sum is over all the nuclear targets in a given ex-
periment. This is slightly more complicated but still per-
mits a rapid calculation of the log-likelihood for a given
DM mass. The full log-likelihood is then obtained by
summing over experiments.

For a given mock data sample, we scan over 25 values
of the DM mass, to calculate the maximum likelihood in
each case (and therefore the overall maximum likelihood).
For each DM mass, we calculate the log-likelihood on a
grid of couplings, linearly spaced over the ranges:

log10(λp/GeV−2) ∈ [−10, −6] ,
log10(λn/GeV−2) ∈ [−10, −6] ,

f ∈ [−1, 1] .

In the case of Majorana-like DM, we use a grid of (200 ×
200) values of (λp, λn), each for f = 1 and f = −1. For

7 In order to be able to use Eq. (A1) to calculate the Xenon likeli-
hood, we approximate the detector as containing a single isotope
with (A, Z) = (131, 54). This has a negligible eﬀect on the direct
detection rate, but allows us to calculate the likelihood much
more quickly.

Dirac-like DM, we use a grid of (50 × 50 × 50) points in
(λp, λn, f ).

From this initial grid scan, we obtain an estimate of the
maximum likelihood points under the Dirac-like hypoth-
esis and the Majorana-like hypothesis. For each hypoth-
esis, we then perform 10 reﬁnement steps, recalculating
the likelihood on another grid, using the same number
of grid points, but each time over a smaller range of pa-
rameter values. The range of parameters for each reﬁne-
ment step is centred on the maximum-likelihood param-
eter value from the previous step.

We repeat this procedure (scanning and reﬁning over
couplings and masses to obtain the maximum likeli-
hoods for the Dirac-like and Majorana-like hypotheses)
for each mock dataset. By generating and ﬁtting 100
mock datasets, we estimate the median signiﬁcance which
can be obtained with a given ensemble of experiments.

We have veriﬁed that the method gives good conver-
gence, i.e. that increasing the number of grid points does
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results. The code used to per-
form the scans, along with code to analyse and plot the
resulting data is publicly available and can be down-
loaded at https://github.com/bradkav/AntiparticleDM
[45].

Appendix B: Analytic Estimates

The likelihood-based calculations described in App. A
are computationally expensive, so it is important to ob-
tain an initial estimate of which parts of parameter space
will maximise the discrimination signiﬁcance. We can
then focus on these regions for the full likelihood-based
calculations, rather than wasting computational time on
parameter points where the signiﬁcance is expected to be
low.

In order to obtain this estimate, we consider having
three experimental targets: X, Y and Z. If DM is a Dirac
particle, the DM-nucleus cross section for each target is
given by Eq. (3). We write these cross sections as σD
X ,
Y and σD
σD
Z .
We imagine that experiments X and Y measure their
respective DM-nucleus cross sections to be ˜σX and ˜σY
respectively. As described in detail in QRY17 [18], we
can use these two measurements to estimate the DM-
nucleon couplings (λM
n ), assuming that the DM is a
Majorana particle. That is, we solve:

p , λM

(cid:2)λM

p N X

p + λM

n N X
n

(cid:2)λM

p N Y

(B2)

There are two possible solutions for (λM
n ), up to an
overall sign degeneracy. With these, we can calculate the
DM-nucleus cross section σM
Z which we would expect in a
third target Z, assuming again a Majorana DM particle.

FIG. 7. Analytic cross section discrepancy between
Dirac and Majorana DM. Discrepancy ∆ (Eq. (B3)) be-
tween the DM-Xe cross section expected for a Majorana par-
ticle σM (estimated from the ‘measured’ DM-Si and DM-Ar
cross sections) and for a Dirac particle σD (using the ‘true’
coupling values).

We then compare σM

Z , the cross section expected in a Z
target under the assumption of a Majorana particle, and
σD
Z , the true DM-nucleus cross section we would measure,
given the Dirac nature of the particle. To do this, we
evaluate the fractional diﬀerence ∆ between the two cross
sections,

∆ =

(σD

Z )2

Z − σM
(σD
Z )2

,

(B3)

as a function of the input parameters f and λn/λp. Small
values of ∆ indicate that the data should be well de-
scribed by both Majorana and Dirac DM, while large
values imply that the cross sections in the Majorana
and Dirac scenarios should diﬀer substantially, suggest-
ing that signiﬁcance discrimination should be possible.

In Fig. 7, we plot the cross section discrepancy ∆ for
ensemble A. Here, we have used the Ar and Si experi-
ments to estimate the Majorana couplings and plot the
value of ∆ calculated for the Xe experiment. Due to
the large target mass and A2 coherent enhancement of
Xenon-based detectors, we expect the Xe experiment to
observe the largest number of events and therefore to ob-
tain the most precise estimate of the DM-nucleus cross
section. It is the discrepancy in Xenon which we there-
fore expect to drive the discrimination signiﬁcance.

From Fig. 7, we see that the largest discrepancies be-
tween the Majorana and Dirac cross sections are obtained
when there is a partial cancellation of the DM-Xe or DM-
Ar cross sections, in agreement with the discussion of
Sec. II. Instead, where there is no substantial cancella-
tion (far from f = −1 or where λn/λp does not match

smaller (< O(10%)). Such a diﬀerence is likely to fall
within the statistical errors of a cross section measure-
ment and so discrimination will be diﬃcult.

We have checked these analytic estimates for diﬀer-

ent ensembles and over much wider range of parame-
ter values. We ﬁnd in all cases that the cross section
discrepancy decreases rapidly away from the parameter
region depicted in Fig. 7. We therefore focus in this
work on the parameter ranges λn/λp ∈ [0.5, 1.0] and
f ∈ [−1.00, −0.94].
