Abstract

An arrangement of hyperplanes is a ﬁnite collection of hyperplanes in a real Euclidean
space. To such a collection one associates the characteristic polynomial that encodes the
combinatorics of intersections of the hyperplanes. Finding the characteristic polynomial of
the Shi threshold and the Catalan threshold arrangements was an open problem in Stanley’s
list of problems in [1]. Seunghyun Seo solved both the problems by clever arguments using
the ﬁnite ﬁeld method in [3, 4]. However, in his paper, he left open the problem of computing
the characteristic polynomial of a broader class of threshold arrangements, the so-called
“generalized threshold” arrangements whose deﬁning set of hyperplanes is given by xi +xj =
−l, −l + 1, ..., m − 1, m for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n where l, m ∈ N. In this paper, we present a method
for computing the characteristic polynomial of this family of arrangements.

Introduction

A set of hyperplane arrangements over a vector space V is a ﬁnite set of aﬃne hyperplanes in
V . In the literature, usually the underlying vector space is taken to be Rn for some n. To every
such hyperplane arrangement, one can associate a set of regions which are simply the connected
components of the complements of the hyperplanes in the given arrangement. Over the course
of their study, special interest has been given to computing the number of regions of speciﬁc
families of arrangements.

To every hyperplane arrangement one associates a polynomial called the characteristic poly-
nomial of the arrangement. This polynomial captures lots of useful information about the under-
lying arrangement. In his groundbreaking work [8], Zaslavsky proved that the number of regions
of a hyperplane arrangement can be obtained by evaluating the characteristic polynomial of the
arrangement at −1 and computing its absolute value. Hence one could calculate the number of
regions provided the characteristic polynomial of the arrangement can be computed easily.

However computing the characteristic polynomial by itself is not an easy task. In his seminal
paper [5], Athanasiadis came up with a very elegant yet powerful method for computing the
characteristic polynomial of any arrangement over the rationals, the so called ﬁnite ﬁeld method.
Ever since, the computation of characteristic polynomial for various arrangements have been
attained through the ﬁnite ﬁeld method. (See for example, [4, 3]).

In the present article, we compute the characteristic polynomial of the generalized threshold

arrangement which is given by the following set of hyperplanes over Rn:

xi + xj = −l, −l + 1, 1, 2, . . . , k

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

Here l, k are arbitrary non-negative integers. The case of l = 0 and k = 1, also called the
Shi threshold arrangement was an open problem mentioned by Stanley in [1]. In his paper, [3]

Seunghyun Seo had solved the characteristic polynomial for this arrangement. He also goes on
to solve the case of l = 1, k = 1, the so called Catalan threshold arrangement in [4]. Seo left open
the problem of computing the characteristic polynomial for the above mentioned generalized
threshold arrangements.

The main contributions of this article are Theorems 9 and 10 which present a method for
computing the characteristic polynomial of the generalized threshold arrangement. The result is
obtained by an extension of the method used to compute the characteristic polynomial for the
Shi and Catalan threshold arrangements by Seo.

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we recall some of the basic concepts of hyperplane arrangements. The interested
reader is referred to [9] for more information.

2.1 Characteristic polynomials and the ﬁnite ﬁeld method

Let n be a positive integer and K be a ﬁeld. A hyperplane arrangement (or an arrangement)
over K n is a ﬁnite set of hyperplanes A in K n, with each hyperplane having coeﬃcients from K.

Deﬁnition 1. Given an arrangement A, we let L(A) be the set of all possible intersections of
hyperplanes in A, including K n and the empty set. For any two intersections x, y deﬁne x ≤ y
iﬀ x ⊇ y. L(A) is called the intersection poset of A.

Clearly in this intersection poset, K n ≤ x for any element x. For any two elements x, y ∈
L(A), let the interval [x, y] be equal to the set {z : x ≤ z ≤ y}. Let Int(L(A)) denote the set of
all intervals of the intersection poset of A. For the intersection poset, one can deﬁne the Mobius
function µ : L(A) → Z as follows:

µ([x, x]) = 1

and

µ([x, y]) = −

µ(y)

Xx≤z<y

For any interval of the form [K n, x] we abuse notation and denote µ([K n, x]) by µ(x). Using

the Mobius function, we can deﬁne the characteristic polynomial of an arrangement A.

Deﬁnition 2. The characteristic polynomial χA(t) of an arrangement A is the polynomial given
by:

χA(t) :=

µ(x)tdim(x)

Xx∈L(A)
Here dim(x) refers to the dimension of the aﬃne subspace x in the vector space K n.
In the literature almost all hyperplanes are deﬁned and studied over the ﬁeld K = Rn. We
let A be a hyperplane arrangement over R. A region of A is a connected component of the
complement of the hyperplanes (i.e), any connected component of Rn −
H∈A H. Let r(A)
denote the number of regions of A.

S

The characteristic polynomial contains important information about the corresponding hy-
perplane arrangement, as evidenced by the following result. The celebrated theorem of Zaslavsky
in [8] states that,

2

Theorem 3. For an arrangement A, we have

r(A) = (−1)nχA(−1)

However the task of computing characteristic polynomials is a hard task by itself. But if A is
a hyperplane arrangement over the vector space Qn then there is a powerful method called the
ﬁnite ﬁeld method for computing the corresponding characteristic polynomial.
Given an arrangement A over Qn, we can get an arrangement over Fn

p for any prime q as

follows: Suppose H is a hyperplane in A of the form:

a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn = b

for some a1, a2, . . . , an, b ∈ Q. Let d denote the least common multiple of the denominators

of a1, a2, . . . , an, b. Multiplying the hyperplane with d on both sides, we get

1x1 + a′
a′

2x2 + · · · + a′

nxn = b′

where each a′

i = d · ai and b′ = d · b. Clearly a′

1, . . . , a′

n, b′ ∈ Z. Let a′′

i = a′

i mod p and

b′′ = b′ mod p and let Hp be the hyperplane:

a′′
1 x1 + a′′

2 x2 + · · · + a′′

nxn = b′′

For each H ∈ A, we get one such hyperplane Hp. Let the collection of all such Hp be the

arrangement Ap over the vector space Fn
Theorem 4. For all but ﬁnitely many primes p, L(A) ∼= L(Ap)
Theorem 5. [5, 6] If L(A) ∼= L(Ap) for some prime p, then

p . The following two theorems are well known:

χA(p) = pn − (cid:12)

method to compute the characteristic polynomial of the braid arrangement Bn given by

xi − xj = 0,

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

For a large enough prime p ≫ n, we count the number of elements (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ Fn
p
such that ai − aj 6= 0 for any i < j. The number of such tuples can be clearly seen to be
p(p − 1) . . . (p − n + 1). By the ﬁnite ﬁeld method we have that χBn (p) = p(p − 1) . . . (p − n + 1).
Since this is true for inﬁnitely many primes and since χBn is a polynomial in one variable, we
can conclude that

χBn (t) = t(t − 1) . . . (t − n + 1)

Applying Zaslavasky’s theorem one can now infer that r(Bn) = (−1)n · χBn(−1) = n!.

A few more examples relevant to our work are the Shi arrangement ([2]) Sn, given by the

following set of hyperplanes

xi − xj = 0, 1

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

and the Catalan arrangement Cn whose deﬁning hyperplanes are,

xi − xj = −1, 0, 1

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

3

The characteristic polynomials of Sn and Cn respectively are

χSn(t) = t(t − n)n−1

χCn (t) = t(t − n − 1)(t − n − 2) . . . (t − 2n + 1)

and hence the number of regions by Zaslavsky’s theorem is

r(Sn) = (n + 1)n−1

r(Cn) = n!Cn

where Cn = 1

The Shi threshold arrangement ST n is given by the following set of hyperplanes

xi + xj = 0, 1

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

and the Catalan threshold arrangement CT n by,

xi + xj = −1, 0, 1

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

Using the ﬁnite ﬁeld method, in [3] and [4], Seo proved that the characteristic polynomial of

ST n and CT n respectively is,

3 Generalized threshold arrangements

Deﬁnition 6. The generalized threshold arrangement Tn,k,l is the hyperplane arrangement given
by the following equations: For a ﬁxed k, l and n, it is given by:

xi + xj = −l, −l + 1, . . . , 0, 1, 2, . . . , k

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

Whenever l is ﬁxed to be zero we will denote the resulting set of arrangements to be ST n,k
(i.e), ST n,k := Tn,k,0 and whenever l = −1, we will denote the resulting arrangement by CT n,k
(i.e), CT n,k := Tn,k,1. In this section we show that to compute the characteristic polynomial of
Tn,k,l, it suﬃces to compute the characteristic polynomial of either ST n,k+l or CT n,k+l+1.

For a prime p, let Fp denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld consisting of p elements. By the ﬁnite ﬁeld
method there exists a number m such that if 2r + 1 > m and 2r + 1 is a prime then computing
the characteristic polynomial χTn,k,l at 2r + 1, is equivalent to computing the cardinality of the
following set:

U = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Fn

2r+1 : xi + xj 6= −l, −l + 1, . . . , 0, 1, 2, . . . , k for i < j}

Suppose l is even. Consider the hyperplane arrangement ST n,k+l. By the ﬁnite ﬁeld method
there exists a number m0 such that if 2r + 1 > m0 and 2r + 1 is a prime then computing the
characteristic polynomial χST n,k+l at 2r + 1, is equivalent to computing the cardinality of the
following set:

U0 = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Fn

2r+1 : xi + xj 6= 0, 1, 2, . . . , k + l for i < j}

Let 2r + 1 > max(m, m0). Consider the bijection A : Fn

2r+1 → Fn

2r+1 where

A(x1, x2, . . . , xn) =

x1 +

(cid:18)

l
2

, x2 +

l
2

, . . . , xn +

l
2 (cid:19)

It is clear that (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ U ⇐⇒ A(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U0. Therefore |U | = |U0|. Hence,
it follows that χTn,k,l(2r + 1) = χST n,k+l(2r + 1) for inﬁnitely many primes 2r + 1. So we can
conclude that χTn,k,l = χST n,k+l.

Suppose l is odd. Consider the hyperplane arrangement CT n,k+l+1. By the ﬁnite ﬁeld method
there exists a number m1 such that if 2r + 1 > m1 and 2r + 1 is a prime then computing the
characteristic polynomial χCT n,k+l+1 at 2r + 1 is equivalent to computing the cardinality of the
following set:

U1 = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Fn

2r+1 : xi + xj 6= 1, 2, . . . , k + l + 1 for i < j}

Let 2r + 1 > max(m, m1). Consider the bijection A′ : Fn

2r+1 → Fn

2r+1 where

A′(x1, x2, . . . , xn) =

x1 +

(cid:18)

, x2 +

l + 1

, . . . , xn +

l + 1

2 (cid:19)

It is clear that (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ U ⇐⇒ A′(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U1. Hence we can conclude that
χTn,k,l = χCT n,k+l+1.

Combining the previous two observations, we get

Lemma 7. χTn,k,l = χST n,k+l if l is even and χTn,k,l = χCT n,k+l+1 otherwise.

4 Characteristic polynomial of ST n,k

The arrangement ST n,k is given by,

xi + xj = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

As discussed before, for a large enough prime 2r + 1 computing the characteristic polynomial

χST k,n at 2r + 1 is equivalent to computing the cardinality of the set:

U = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Fn

2r+1 : xi + xj 6= 0, 1, 2, . . . , k, for i < j}

Here F2r+1 = {0, 1, 2, . . . , r, −1, −2, . . . , −r} denotes the ﬁnite ﬁeld with 2r + 1 elements.
Instead of computing this value directly, we go via a graph-theoretic approach. Intuitively, we
will form a graph with 2r + 1 vertices such that computation of the number of independent sets
of size atmost n in this graph will easily enable us to count the cardinality of U . For general
graphs, this computation is hard. However the graph that we construct will have some special
properties which we will exploit to compute the required number.

Construct a graph G = (V, E) where V = {0, 1, 2 . . . , r, −1, −2 . . . , −r} and (i, j) ∈ E iﬀ
i + j ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k}. (Here + refers to the addition operation in F2r+1). Figure 1 depicts the
graph G.

An independent set of the graph G is a set of vertices {i1, i2, . . . , iw} such that for every j
and l, (ij, il) /∈ E. Similarly, a clique of the graph G is a set of vertices {i1, i2, . . . , iw} such that
for every j and l, (ij, il) ∈ E. The size of an independent set (resp. clique) is the number of
vertices in it. Let In denote the set of all independent sets of size atmost n in graph G. It is
easy to notice that if (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ U then the set {x1, x2, . . . , xn} ∈ In.

Consider the case when k is even and r is suﬃciently large so that the sets C1 = {0, 1, 2, . . . , k/2}

and C2 = {−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k/2 − 1} are disjoint. It is easy to notice that both these sets
are cliques in G. With this observation it is obvious that if (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ U , then the
number of indices i such that xi can be in {0, 1, 2, . . . , k/2} is atmost one and similarly for
{−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k/2 − 1}. Hence if x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U , x can be belong to any of these
four cases:

1. There is no i such that xi ∈ C1 or xi ∈ C2.

2. There is a unique i such that xi ∈ C1 and there is no j such that xj ∈ C2.

3. There is no i such that xi ∈ C1 and there is exactly one j such that xj ∈ C2.

4. There is exactly one i such that xi ∈ C1 and there is exactly one xj such that xj ∈ C2.

In the remainder of this section we deal with the above cases.

4.1 No elements are picked from C1 or C2

In this case, we would like to count the number of elements in U such that they have no values
from either of the cliques, (i.e) we want to count the cardinality of the set U ′ where

U ′ = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ U, ∀i ∈ [n], xi /∈ C1 and xi /∈ C2}

Let G′ be the induced subgraph of G on the vertices V \(C1∪C2). We now show a fundamental

relation between the number of independent sets in G′ to the number of elements in U ′.

Figure 1: Graph G with the two cliques C1 and C2. There is an edge between i and j iﬀ
i + j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k}. The self-loops of each element in C1 and C2 are not present here.

Suppose I = {y1, y2, . . . , yq} is a q-sized independent set in G′. We claim that I contributes
to S(n, q) · q! number of elements to the set U ′ where S(n, q) denotes Stirling numbers of the
second kind.

More precisely, we want to count the number of elements in U ′ such that if (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈
U ′, then each xi = yj for some j and each yj = xl for some l. But this is precisely the number
of surjective functions from [n] to [q] which is equal to S(n, q) · q!.

Let the number of q sized independent sets in G′ be denoted by I(q). By the above observa-

tion, the number of elements in U ′ is

N := |U ′| =

I(q) · S(n, q) · q!

(1)

X1≤q≤n

Now for a given q, we derive a closed form formula for I(q).
Clearly G′ is a bipartite graph with partitions {k/2 + 1, . . . , r} and {−1, . . . , −r + k/2}.
Suppose we pick l elements from the ﬁrst partition, say, i1 < i2 < · · · < il. Now we have to pick
q − l elements from the second partition, say, j1 < j2 < · · · < jq−l such that the pair (ia, jb) is
not an edge for any ia, jb. In such a case, we will call the sets {i1, i2, . . . , il} and {j1, . . . , jq−l}
compatible. For a ﬁxed i1, i2, . . . , il, let f (i1, i2, . . . , il) be the number of such compatible sets
from the second partition. Hence,

I(q) =

f (i1, i2, . . . , il)

(2)

X0≤l≤q

Xk
2 +1≤i1<i2<···<il≤r

For a ﬁxed (i1, i2, . . . , il) with i1 < i2 < · · · < il, we will ﬁrst compute the number of
elements in the second partition such that none of the elements share an edge with any of the
ij. To calculate this number notice that

• If a ≥ −ij and (ij, a) /∈ E, then (ik, a) /∈ E for any k ≥ j and,

• If a < −ij, then (ij, a) /∈ E for any a.

Hence we can cut the partition {−1, . . . , −r + k/2} into l + 1 slices

{−1, . . . , max (−r + k/2, −i1)}, {−i1 − 1, . . . , max (−r + k/2, −i2)}, . . . ,

{−il−1 − 1, . . . , max (−il, −r + k/2)}, {−il − 1, . . . , −r + k/2} (3)

7

and for each ij compute the number of elements in the jth slice which do not share an edge with ij,
whose overall value will give us the number of elements which don’t share an edge with any of the
ij. (If any of the ij is such that −ij ≤ −r+k/2, then the set {−ij −1, . . . , max (−r+k/2, −ij+1)}
is taken to be empty).
More formally

Deﬁnition 8. Suppose x belongs to the jth slice of {−1, . . . , −r + k/2}, (i.e), x ∈ {−ij−1 −
1, . . . , max (−ij, −r + k/2)}. Then x is called independent if x does not share an edge with ij.

We have the following two cases:

• Suppose il < r − k/2. In this case, −il − 1 > −r + k/2. The number of elements in the ﬁrst
slice which are independent is clearly max (i1 − (k + 1), 0). It is also easy to see that the
number of elements in the jth slice which are independent is max (ij − ij−1 − (k + 1), 0).
Finally all the elements in {−il − 1, . . . , −r + k/2} don’t share an edge with any of the ij’s
and so the total number of elements in the second partition of G′ which don’t share an
edge with any of the ij’s is

max (i1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (i2 − i1 − (k + 1), 0) + . . .

+ max (il − il−1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (r − k/2 − il, 0)

• Suppose ∃ l′ s.t. i′

l ≥ r − k/2. In this case notice that for any l′′ ≥ l′, il′′ ≥ r − k/2. Similar
to the ﬁrst case, it is clear that for any j < l′, the number of independent elements in the
jth slice is max (ij − ij−1 − (k + 1), 0). Notice that for any j > l′, the jth slice is empty
and so they don’t contribute any elements. All it suﬃces now is to give the number of
independent elements in the l′th slice. This is easily seen to be {max(il−1 − il − (k + 1), 0)}.
Noticing that for any j > l′, the expression max(ij − ij−1 − (k + 1), 0) always gives 0 as
the answer, the number of independent elements in this case as well is

max (i1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (i2 − i1 − (k + 1), 0) + . . .

+ max (il − il−1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (r − k/2 − il, 0)

Hence the total number of independent elements is

max (i1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (i2 − i1 − (k + 1), 0) + . . .

+ max (il − il−1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (r − k/2 − il, 0)

(4)

We will denote this value by g(i1, . . . , il). It is then easily seen that f (i1, . . . , il) =

g(i1,...,il)

4.2 Exactly one element is picked from either C1 or C2

We consider two diﬀerent cases.

Let 0 ≤ p ≤ k/2 be the chosen element from the ﬁrst clique. In this case, we would like to
count the number of elements in U s.t. it contains p in some position and contains no elements
from the second clique. Let U ′
p ⊆ U be such that all elements in U ′
p contain p in some position
and contain no elements from the second clique, (i.e),

U ′

p = {(x1, . . . , xn) : (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U, ∃i such that xi = p, and ∀j xj /∈ C2}

8

Let F = {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − p} ∪ {−1, −2, . . . , −p} ∪ {−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k/2 − 1} and let G′
p be
the induced subgraph of G on the vertex set V \ F . Once again, we can relate the independent
sets in G′

p to the elements in U ′

p as follows:

Suppose I = {y1, . . . , yq} is a q-sized independent set in G′

it is clear that I contributes to S(n − 1, q) · q! number of elements to the set U ′
of q sized independent sets in G′

p be denoted by Ip(q). Hence, the number of elements in U ′

p. By a similar argument as above,
p. Let the number
p is

Np := |U ′

p| = n 

Ip(q) · S(n − 1, q) · q!

The graph G′

p is a bipartite graph with partitions {k−p+1, . . . , r} and {−p−1, . . . , −r+k/2}.

of the graph G′

{−p − 1, . . . , −i1, }, {−i1 − 1, . . . , −i2}, . . . , {−il−1 − 1, . . . , −il}, {−il − 1, . . . , −r + k/2}

which we will denote by g(i1, . . . , il). It can once again be shown that the number of independent
elements is

max (i1 − p − (k + 1), 0) + max (i2 − i1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (i3 − i2 − (k + 1), 0) + . . .

+ max (il − il−1 − (k + 1), 0) + max (r − k/2 − il, 0)

We can do a similar computation for the case when p is chosen from the second clique.

4.3 Exactly one element is picked from both C1 and C2

Let 0 ≤ p1 ≤ k/2 and 0 ≤ p2 ≤ k/2 − 1 be such that p1, −r + p2 are the two chosen elements
from each of the cliques. Let U ′
p1,p2 contains
both p1 and −r + p2 in some positions. Let F = {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − p1} ∪ {r − p2, r − p2 + 1, . . . , r} ∪
{−1, −2, . . . , −p1} ∪ {−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k − (p2 + 1)}. Let G′
p1,p2 be the induced subgraph of G
on the vertices V \ F . Once again, we can relate the independent sets in G′
p1,p2 to the elements
in U ′

p1,p2 be the subset of U such that each element in U ′

p1,p2 as before and compute Np1,p2 , where

Np1,p2 := |U ′

p1,p2| = n(n − 1) 

where the function Ip1,p2 (q) is the number of independent sets of size q in G′

be computed as before.

5 Characteristic polynomial of CT n,k

The arrangement CT n,k is given by,

xi + xj = 1, 2, . . . , k

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n

For a large enough prime 2r + 1, computing the characteristic polynomial χST k,n at 2r + 1 is

equivalent to computing the cardinality of the set:

U ′ = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ Fn

2r+1 : xi + xj 6= 1, 2, . . . , k, for i < j}

As before we construct a graph G′ = (V ′, E′) where V ′ = F2r+1 and (i, j) ∈ E′ iﬀ i +
1 =
1 and
1 and
2. Further we also have that 0 is adjacent to every element

j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. Consider the case when k is even and r is suﬃciently large so that C′
{1, 2, . . . , k/2} and C′
2 = {−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k/2 − 1} are disjoint. It is easy to see that C′
C′
2 are cliques and so if (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U ′ there exists atmost one index i such that xi ∈ C′
atmost one index j such that xj ∈ C′
in C′

1, but not to itself. Therefore the computation naturally splits into six cases:

1. There is no i such that xi ∈ C′

1 or xi ∈ C′

2 or xi = 0.

2. There is no i such that xi ∈ C′

1 or xi ∈ C′

2 and there is atleast one j such that xj = 0.

10

3. There is a unique i such that xi ∈ C′

1 and there is no j such that xj ∈ C′

2 and there is no

k such that xk = 0.

4. There is no i such that xi ∈ C′

1 and there is exactly one j such that xj ∈ C′

2 and there is

no k such that xk = 0.

5. There is no i such that xi ∈ C′
atleast one k such that xk = 0.

1 and there is exactly one j such that xj ∈ C′

2 and there is

6. There is exactly one i such that xi ∈ C′

1 and there is exactly one xj such that xj ∈ C′

2 and

there is no k such that xk = 0.

The ﬁrst and second cases

We show how to compute the number of elements satisfying case 1. Let
U ′′ = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ U ′, ∀i ∈ [n], xi /∈ C′
Let G′′ be the induced subgraph on V \ (C′

independent sets of size q in G′′. Similar to section 4.1, we have

1 and xi /∈ C′

2 and xi 6= 0}

1 ∪ C′

2 ∪ {0}) and let I ′(q) denote the number of

|U ′′| =

I ′(q) · S(n, q) · q!

X1≤q≤n

If we deﬁne f ′(i1, i2, . . . , il) to be the number of compatible sets for {i1, . . . , il} in the second
partition of G′′, then we get

I ′(q) =

f ′(i1, i2, . . . , il)

(8)

X0≤l≤q

Xk
2 +1≤i1<i2<···<il≤r

By a similar reasoning as before, we can easily conclude that, f ′(i1, . . . , il) =

where g′(i1, . . . , il) is

g′

(i1,...,il)
q−l

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

max ((i1 − 1) − (k + 1), 0) + max ((i2 − i1 − 1) − (k + 1), 0) + . . .

+ max ((il − il−1 − 1) − (k + 1), 0) + max (r − k/2 − il + 1, 0)

11

We will now show how to compute the number of elements satisfying case 2. We want to

compute the cardinality of the set U ′′ ⊆ U ′ given by:

U ′′ = {(x1, . . . , xn) : (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U ′, ∀i xi /∈ C′

1, xi /∈ C′

2, ∃j xj = 0}

To do this we ﬁx a number l such that 1 ≤ l ≤ n and let h(l) denote the set of all elements in
U ′′ such that there exists positions i1 < i2 < · · · < il such that xj = 0 ⇐⇒ j ∈ {i1, i2, . . . , il}.
Therefore we have

|U ′′| =

X1≤l≤n

n
l (cid:19)

(cid:18)

h(l)

Hence it suﬃces to compute the number h(l) for each l. Consider the induced subgraph G′′
2 ∪ {0}). Letting I ′(q) be the number of independent sets of size q

on the vertex set V \ (C′
in G′′, we can easily conclude that

1 ∪ C′

h(l) =

I ′(q) · S(n − l, q) · q!

X1≤q≤n−l

By equation 8 we already know how to compute I ′(q) and so we are done.

The third and fourth cases

Consider the set of elements which satisfy the third case. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ k/2 be the element chosen
from the ﬁrst clique. Deﬁne

U ′′

p = {(x1, . . . , xn) : (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U ′, ∃i such that xi = p, and ∀j xj /∈ C′

2, xj 6= 0}

Let F = {0, 1, . . . , k − p} ∪ ∪{−1, −2, . . . , −p + 1} ∪ {−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k/2 − 1} and let
p(q) denote the number of independent

p be the induced subgraph of G′ on V ′ \ F . Letting I ′

G′′
sets of size q in G′′

p we get that

|U ′′

p | = n 

I ′
p(q) · S(n − 1, q) · q!


Similar to section 4.2, we can write

X1≤q≤n−1



I ′
p(q) =

f ′(i1, i2, . . . , il)

X0≤l≤q

X
k−p+1≤i1<i2<···<il≤r

where f ′(i1, . . . , il) is the number of compatible sets for (i1, i2, . . . , il) in the second partition

of the graph G′′

p . Letting g′(i1, . . . , il) equal to

max ((i1 −p−1)−(k +1), 0)+max ((i2 −i1 −1)−(k +1), 0)+max ((i3 −i2 −1)−(k +1), 0)+. . .

+ max ((il − il−1 − 1) − (k + 1), 0) + max (r − k/2 − il + 1, 0)

we get that f ′(i1, . . . , il) =

g′

(i1,...,il)
q−l

A similar computation can be done when the fourth case is satisﬁed (i.e) p is picked from the

(cid:0)
second clique and is of the form −r ≤ p ≤ −r + k/2 − 1.

(cid:1)

12

The ﬁfth and the sixth cases

Let 0 ≤ p ≤ k/2 − 1 such that −r + p is the chosen element from the second clique. Deﬁne

U ′′

p,0 = {(x1, . . . , xn) : (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ U ′, ∃i such that xi = −r + p, and ∀j xj /∈ C′
1,

and ∃k such that xk = 0}

Similar to the second case, we ﬁx a number l such that 1 ≤ l ≤ n − 1 and let h(l) denote
p,0 such that there exists positions i1 < i2 < · · · < il such that

the set of all elements in U ′′
xj = 0 ⇐⇒ j ∈ {i1, i2, . . . , il}. Therefore we have

|U ′′

p,0| = n 

X1≤l≤n−1



n
l (cid:19)

(cid:18)

h(l)



Let F = {r − p + 1, . . . , r} ∪ {−r, −r + 1, . . . , −r + k − (p + 1)} ∪ {0, 1, . . . , k} and consider

the induced subgraph G′ on V ′ \ F . It can then be seen that,

h(l) =

I ′
p(q) · S(n − l − 1, q) · q!

X1≤q≤n−l−1

where I ′

p(q) is the number of independent sets of size q in G′′

p , which we know how to compute.

For the sixth case, for every p1, p2 such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ k/2, 0 ≤ p2 ≤ k/2 − 1, we can once
p1,p2 (q) similar to the one deﬁned in section 4.3, using which we can

again deﬁne a function I ′
compute the number of required elements.

6 Some computations

In this subsection, we present the characteristic polynomials for ST k,n for some values of k, n.
In particular, our computation agrees with the polynomials presented in [3]. Further there was
an error in the computation in [3] for the characteristic polynomial of ST 1,2(t), which we have
corrected here.

χST 1,2 (t) = t2 − 2t − 2
χST 1,3 (t) = t3 − 6t2 + 12t − 8
χST 1,4 (t) = t4 − 12t3 + 60t2 − 142t + 130
χST 1,5 (t) = t5 − 20t4 + 180t3 − 870t2 + 2190t − 2252
χST 2,3 (t) = t3 − 3t2 − 3t − 36
χST 2,4 (t) = t4 − 6t3 + 27t2 − 663t + 3583
χST 2,5 (t) = t5 − 10t4 + 125t3 − 4125t2 + 49410t − 188578
χST 3,4 (t) = t4 − 204t2 + 1240t + 740
χST 3,5 (t) = t5 − 420t3 + 2730t2 + 44860t − 425199

Applying Zaslavsky’s theorem, we get that the sequence r(ST 1,n)n≥2 is,

The sequence r(ST 2,n)n≥3 is,
