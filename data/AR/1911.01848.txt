ABSTRACT

Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) are widely used as ampliﬁcation stages in gaseous detectors exposed
to high rates. The GEM consists of a polyimide foil which is coated by two thin copper layers.
Charges collected into the holes or created during the ampliﬁcation process may adhere to the
polyimide part inside the holes. This is often accompanied by a change of the effective gain. The
effect is commonly known as the “charging-up effect”.
This work presents a systematic investigation of the effect under well-controlled and monitored
conditions for a single standard GEM foil in Ar/CO2 (90/10) gas for varying rates of X-ray interactions
in the detector and for different gains of the foil. In order to cover a wide range of different rates,
we apply two different methods. The ﬁrst one is based on a current measurement while the second
one relies on the analysis of 55Fe spectra over time. Both methods give consistent results, showing
an initial increase of the effective gain with time and an asymptotic saturation, which can be well
described by a single-exponential function. We ﬁnd that the characteristic time constants extracted
from our measurements scale inversely proportional to the rate of incoming electrons for a given
GEM voltage. Introducing characteristic quantities, which describe either the number of incoming
electrons per hole or the total number of electrons in a hole per characteristic time, we ﬁnd consistent
numbers for measurements taken at the same GEM voltages. For measurements taken at different
GEM voltages, however, also the characteristic total number of electrons inside the hole, which is
supposed to take into account the different effective gains, is found to be higher by a factor of about
108). This hints at a

Introduction

Detectors based on the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [1] are widely used in particle physics experiments that require
high position resolution over large areas in high-rate environments (e.g. COMPASS [2, 3], LHCb [4], TOTEM [5, 6],
JLab Hall A [7] as well as ALICE [8, 9] and CMS [10, 11] after their upgrades). The GEM consists of a 50 µm thick
polyimide foil which is coated on both sides with 5 µm thick copper layers. In a photolithographic process, holes are
etched into this foil in a hexagonal pattern. Standard GEM foils have an inner diameter of approximately 50 µm, an
outer diameter of approximately 70 µm and a pitch between two neighbouring holes of 140 µm. If a suitable voltage
is applied between both copper layers, strong non-uniform electric ﬁelds are created inside the holes (of the order
of 50 kV/cm), sufﬁcient for incoming electrons to start an avalanche of further ionizations. During this multiplication
process, electrons and ions may diffuse to the polyimide part of the GEM and be adsorbed there as shown in ﬁgure 1.
Due to the high resistivity of the material, the charges remain there for a rather long time. These new charges accumulate

particles end up on the polyimide. For this sim-
ulation, a single electron was placed 100 µm
above the GEM. A drift ﬁeld of 400 V/cm lets
the electron drift towards the GEM hole. The
potential difference over the GEM was cho-
sen to be 300 V. To extract electrons, a ﬁeld
of 2000 V/cm was applied below the GEM. The
gas was set to a mixture of argon and carbon-
dioxide (90:10).

over time and dynamically change the electric ﬁeld inside the hole. This is known as the “charging-up effect”. Many
publications suggest that the charging-up effect is responsible for a change of the effective gain which is time-dependent
and reaches asymptotically a constant value (e.g. in measurements with GEMs [3, 12, 13, 14, 15], in measurements with
different micropattern gaseous detectors [16, 17], as well as in simulations [19, 20, 21]). A quantitative understanding
of the various effects reported (which e.g. include both an increase [3] and a decrease [15] of the effective gain),
however, has not been reached in our opinion. In addition, as we had to experience ourselves, there are many other
external effects which may mimic a genuine charging-up effect. Examples are changes in external conditions like
temperature and pressure, initial instabilities of X-ray generators or time constants intrinsic to the high-voltage power
supply system (see also section 2). Especially for applications that require the gain to remain very stable over time, e.g.
in Time Projection Chambers for dE/dx measurements [8, 22] or in photon detectors [23], a quantitative understanding
of the effect is indispensable.

This work presents a systematic investigation of the charging-up effect under well-controlled and monitored conditions.
By using two different methods, we are able to investigate the time-constant over a wide range of rates of X-ray
interactions. The ﬁrst method makes use of a conventional X-ray tube where the ampliﬁed ionization currents are
sufﬁciently large to be measured with a picoamperemeter. For the second method, the peak position of the Kα line in an
55Fe spectrum is observed over time. Both types of measurement were conducted using a single GEM as ampliﬁcation
stage [24].

2 Setup

In order to measure the charging-up effect, a dedicated detector was set up with a single GEM foil as ampliﬁcation stage.
A sketch of the used detector is shown in ﬁgure 2. It consists of an aluminum vessel with a 100 µm thick Kapton®
400FN0222 window on the top side to irradiate the detector with X-rays. The detector was constantly ﬂushed with
Ar/CO2 (90/10) with a ﬂow of 3 L/h. The total gas volume is approximately 4 L. It consists of a 25.7 mm long drift
volume, in which photons of an X-ray source can convert. The drift ﬁeld Edrift is created by a 50 µm thick polyimide
foil, cladded on both sides with 5 µm copper3. It was set to 400 V/cm in all measurements. The used GEM foil
10 cm2 was produced at CERN with the so-called “double-mask-technique”. With this
with an active area of 10
technique, a double-conical shape of the holes is achieved where the diameter of the holes in the polyimide (called inner
diameter) is slightly smaller than the diameter of the copper holes (called outer diameter). Since earlier measurements
report a strong inﬂuence of the hole shape on the characteristics of the charging-up effect [26], the outer and inner

measured distribution, and the superscripts “top” and “bot” refer to the top side (facing the drift electrode) and the
bottom side (facing the readout electrode), respectively. The voltage across the GEM was set to be either 350 V or 400 V.
An induction ﬁeld Eind of 2000 V/cm extracts the electrons from the GEM and guides them to a pad plane, segmented
1 cm2 size. The induced signals can then be read out for example with a picoamperemeter or can get
in 100 pads of 1
ampliﬁed with a charge-sensitive ampliﬁer, in order to analyze the pulse-height spectrum. The high voltage for each
channel was supplied by a ISEG®EHS 8060n module. Each channel has a 1 GΩ resistor to ground in order to set the
ground reference for the system correctly, as the used high-voltage power supply can not sink currents.
As an X-ray source, either a conventional X-ray tube (Mini-X by Amptek®) or an 55Fe source (with an activity of
11.5 MBq) were used. The X-ray beam was collimated (see ﬁgure 2), with different collimators being used for the
≈
measurements at different GEM voltages. We took great care to ensure that the collimator was oriented perpendicular
to the GEM surface. In addition, we used collimators with a very small aspect ratio (diameter/length) to suppress the
inﬂuence of the penumbra that arises around the central beam spot. In the region of the penumbra, the rate of X-rays
and therefore also the rate of initial electrons is gradually decreasing, leading to a superposition of many different time
constants for the charging-up effect, which would be impossible to disentangle. A negligibly small penumbra is hence
necessary for a proper investigation of the charging-up effect. With the collimators used, the divergence of the X-ray
beam and the penumbra are negligible, such that the irradiated area corresponds to the opening area of the collimator.
This was veriﬁed by illuminating Polaroid ﬁlms with the collimated X-ray sources.

With this setup, it is possible to investigate the charging-up effect especially with a focus on the characteristic time
constant of the gain variations with respect to the rate of ionization electrons entering the GEM (determined by the rate
of X-ray interactions in the conversion volume). Since the used 55Fe source creates a rather small rate of ionization
electrons compared to the Mini-X, a huge bandwidth (from a few fA up to pA) can be covered.

In order to assure that the measured gain variations are caused by the charging-up effect, several disruptive effects were
carefully considered and ruled out. All measurements were conducted in a Faraday cage in order to reduce the inﬂuence
of external noise sources on the signals. The voltage across the GEM was applied at least 24 h before a measurement
was conducted. Additionally, successive measurements were performed at different positions of the foil in order to
ensure that the results were not biased due to partial or full charging-up of foils at a particular irradiation position.
Indeed, performing two successive measurements at the same spot, we did not observe charging-up effects during the
second measurement, proving that the measured change of the effective gain is a local effect. As was shown in [3], the
charging-down time is of the order of several hours, which would require very long waiting times for measurements at
the same spot. Our measurements conﬁrm this behaviour (see also Sec. 5). Temperature, pressure, humidity and oxygen
content of the gas were constantly monitored. All these environmental parameters were measured in the gas system,
directly after the detector. Another important issue is a constant rate of X-ray interactions in the detector. Since the
Mini-X needs some operational time until it delivers a constant rate, a shutter blocked the X-ray beam from entering the
detector for all measurements with the Mini-X, until the rate of X-rays was stable (after approx. 60 min).

3 Measurement Methods

3.1 Measurement method I – Current measurement

The ﬁrst measurement method makes use of a picoamperemeter (originally developed at TU München and further
improved at Bonn University [27]) which was connected to the pad plane of the detector. In its most sensitive mode, the
picoamperemeter has a digital resolution of 0.5 pA and an absolute accuracy of 2 pA, given by a known temperature
dependence and possible calibration uncertainties. Over a time interval of approximately 10 s, it measures 128 values
and sends out the average value as well as the standard deviation (which yields the uncertainty of the average value
when divided by √128, assuming that the ﬂuctuations are purely statistical). A known residual temperature-dependent
behaviour of the picoamperemeter did not affect single measurements, since the temperature variations were always
smaller than 0.5 ◦C. For measurements performed at different times, possible shifts of the order of a few pA due to
different ambient temperatures are taken into account in the systematic uncertainty.

In order to create measurable currents, the Mini-X was used as irradiation source. Here, the GEM voltage was either
set to 350 V or 400 V. The effective gain Geff of the GEM is deﬁned as the ratio between the current measured on the
readout anode Ireadout(t) and the ionization current Iionization induced by X-ray interactions in the drift volume:

Geff(t) =

Ireadout(t)
Iionization

.

(1)

The ionization current can be measured on the top side of the GEM with the GEM voltage and the induction ﬁeld set
to zero. For the charging-up measurements, however, the ionization currents were too small to be measured directly.
Instead, we measured the effective gain separately using higher ionization currents by increasing the current of the
Mini-X signiﬁcantly.

The range of possible X-ray interaction rates is mainly limited by the accuracy of the picoamperemeter. If the current of
the Mini-X is too small, the readout current Ireadout is also small and can not be measured reliably by the picoamperemeter.
If the Mini-X current is too high, the time-constant of the charging-up effect is too small to be measured since the used
picoamperemeter measures only one value each ten seconds. Hence, in the next section, a different method is presented
that makes use of smaller X-ray interaction rates.

3.2 Measurement method II – Pulse-height spectrum analysis

The second measurement method is based on measuring the pulse-height spectrum from an 55Fe source. Since the
effective gain of a single GEM at 350 V in Ar/CO2 (90/10) is not sufﬁcient to observe a clean spectrum, this measurement
method could only be used at a GEM voltage of 400 V. A single-channel charge-sensitive pre-ampliﬁer (Ortec 142 [28])
was connected to the pad plane, with the signals from the four innermost pads summed up (the area of the four pads
is 4 cm2). Afterwards, the signal was fed to the main ampliﬁer (Ortec 671 [29]) where it was shaped (shaping time
3 µs) and ampliﬁed (course gain 300, ﬁne gain 1.5). The shaped and ampliﬁed signal was then fed into a multi-channel
analyzer (MCA-8000A [30]) which was connected to a computer. The spectrum was then analyzed in order to extract
the position of the Kα peak; more details will be given in section 4.2.

If the charging-up effect inﬂuences the gain of the GEM, the peak position of the Kα line will vary over time. Therefore,
many spectra were recorded over a time period of several hours. Each spectrum had a measurement time of either one or
ﬁve minutes. Since the rate of initial ionization electrons is small, the complete measurement took approximately 12 h.
On this timescale, temperature and pressure variations may inﬂuence the gain behaviour signiﬁcantly. Hence, the
peak-position of the Kα line has to be corrected for these effects. In order to do this, many spectra were recorded after
the gain had saturated. Making use of recorded variations of pressure p and temperature T in the detector, a correlation
between the peak position of the Kα line and T /p was derived. A linear ﬁt was applied to these data points and was
then be used to correct for temperature and pressure variations.

The results from measurement method I are depicted in ﬁgures 3 and 4, which show the currents measured at the
readout anode as a function of time for different currents of the X-ray tube and for two different GEM voltages (400 V
in ﬁgure 3 and 350 V in ﬁgure 4). All measured currents exhibit an initial increase with time and a saturation after

On ﬁrst sight, it can be seen from ﬁgures 3 and 4 that an increased rate of ionization electrons (due to a higher current
of the X-ray tube IX-ray) leads to a faster gain increase. Since the effective gain is different for different GEM voltages,
the two measurements will ﬁrst be analyzed separately.

For UGEM = 400 V, two measurements were conducted where the rate of ionization electrons differed by a factor
of approximately two (since the current of the X-ray tube IX-ray was decreased from 70 µA to 35 µA). To be more
precise, the ratio of the saturation currents Isat can be used as a measure for the ratio of the ionization currents,
since Iionization = Isat/Gsat

A possible change of the saturated effective gain (e.g. by a position dependence or by changing environmental
parameters like temperature or pressure) is included in the systematic uncertainty, which is estimated conservatively by
dividing the maximum possible value (I 35 µA

A similar estimation of the systematic uncertainty is also done for other quantities presented in this work. The statistical
uncertainty is much smaller than the quoted systematic uncertainty and hence neglected.

Although the difference is slightly larger than one sigma, the agreement can still be considered fair.

In order to compare measurements performed at different ionization rates (X-ray currents), a new quantity is introduced
following [16, 20] to describe the characteristics of the charging-up process in terms of charges rather than time: the
number of incoming electrons per hole ninc, which is the number of ionization electrons that arrive at a given hole
during the time span of one time constant τ . It can be calculated from the measured quantities by

Isat scales linearly with the ionization current (or rate of X-ray interactions), ninc is expected to be independent

can be calculated by geometric considerations to be 58.91 mm−2. As explained in Sec. 2, the irradiated area Airr

The effective gain was determined by measuring the ionization current on the top side of the GEM, while the voltage

With this information, the number of incoming electrons per hole ninc can be calculated for each measurement. The
values are given in table 1. It can be seen that the values for UGEM = 400 V as well as the ones for UGEM = 350 V
agree within uncertainties. For the two measurement series at different GEM voltages, 400 V and 350 V, however, they
differ by about one order of magnitude. This indicates that the time constant of the charging-up effect depends on
the total number of electrons rather than the initial number of electrons in a hole, as also discussed for thick GEMs

It uses a superposition of four Gaussian-functions (Kα, Kβ and their respective escape peaks) and in addition an
error-function to describe the incomplete collection of charges. The peak centers were ﬁxed relative to each other, as
well as the widths of the Gaussian peaks. This can be done, since the energy of the lines and the energy dependence of
the energy resolution4 are known. From the spectra, the centers µKα of the Kα line can be extracted. Afterwards, the
data points were corrected for changes in temperature and pressure (see section 3.2). For measurement (a) (depicted in

T /p is given in units of K/hPa and the result is in units of MCA channels. The T /p-corrected results are depicted
in ﬁgure 6, where the measurement time for one spectrum was set to one minute for ﬁgure 6a and to ﬁve minutes for
ﬁgure 6b. Due to a small change of the settings of the ampliﬁer, the curves do not saturate at the same value.

Also with this method we observe a clear increase of the effective gain with time that can be ﬁtted with a single
exponential function in accordance with equation 2. Since the rate of initial ionization electrons is smaller compared
to the values from measurement method I, the time constant is much longer. Furthermore, the second measurement
(ﬁgure 6b) was conducted approximately 100 days after the ﬁrst measurement (ﬁgure 6a). Since the activity of the 55Fe
source decreased over time, it also reasonable that a longer time constant is determined.

5 Discussion of the Results

In the presented measurements, the charging-up effect of a single GEM foil was examined at different X-ray rates
and at different GEM voltages. All measurements show an effective gain which initially increases with time and
asymptotically reaches a saturation value. Each single measurement can be described by an exponential function, see
equation 2. This implies that the net accumulation of charges on the polyimide decreases proportionally to the distance
from the saturation value, as it is also discussed e.g. in [20]. Since the direction of electrons after scattering off gas
atoms is almost completely randomized and their mean free path is of the order of a few µm [34] and hence of similar
magnitude as the typical distance to the polyimide, it is to be expected that electrons produced in the vicinity of the
insulator inside a GEM hole still may end up at the polyimide also after saturation. This implies that the condition
reached after saturation is a dynamical equilibrium rather than a static one, with electrons and ions ending up on the
insulator surface at the same rate, instead of being fully repelled by the additional electric ﬁeld due to the charges on the
insulator, as is often conjectured. The result is a constant net charge and a constant electric ﬁeld. This is also supported
by simulations, as will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

Our measurements show that, for a given GEM voltage, the measured time constants of the charging-up effect are
inversely proportional to the rate of incoming electrons. In order to directly compare measurements performed at
different rates, we switch to the characteristic quantity ninc, representing the number of incoming electrons per hole
within one time constant τ . For UGEM = 400 V, four measurements at different rates of incoming electrons were
perfomed. The measured time constants vary by more than two orders of magnitude, from 58 s to 8200 s. When
translated to the number of incoming electrons per hole, all measurements agree with each other within uncertainties
(see tables 1 and 2. From this agreement, one can also conclude that the charging-down time (the characteristic time for
removal of the charges on the polyimide) is signiﬁcantly longer than even the longest observed charging-up time. A
similar conclusion was drawn in [3].

For UGEM = 350 V, the number of incoming electrons per hole is approximately a factor of ten larger than for
400 V (see table 1). This suggests that the total number of electrons in the hole in the characteristic time τ might
be the more appropriate quantity to consider. The characteristic total number of electrons in the hole ntot can be
calculated by multiplying the number of incoming electrons per hole by the effective gain and dividing by the extraction
efﬁciency. Using ntot as a characteristic quantity reduces the discrepancy between measurements performed at different
voltages/gains to a factor of approximately 3.5, but cannot fully reconcile the numbers. According to our measurements,
there seems to be a residual dependence of the characteristic charge on the voltage. Possible reasons for this may be the
movement of charges on the insulator surfaces and through the material bulk which may depend on the applied GEM
voltage, but also on gas properties like the water content, etc.. Further measurements will be conducted to understand
this residual voltage dependence in more detail.

6 Conclusion and Outlook

In this work, the charging-up effect of single standard GEM foils was investigated experimentally under well-controlled
conditions. In order to study the rate dependence of the effect over a wide range of X-ray interactions in the conversion
volume above the GEM foil, we made use of two different measurement methods. For the ﬁrst method, a conventional
X-ray tube was used which provided a high rate of ionization electrons, allowing for the measurement of currents on
the readout anode. The second method relied on an 55Fe source that created a comparatively small rate of ionization
electrons and on the analysis of 55Fe spectra taken in short time intervals.

Our measurements consistently show an initial increase of the effective gain of the GEM foil from the point where
the irradiation is started, approaching a saturation value after some characteristic time. Fitting an exponential function
to the data, we extracted characteristic time constants and found that they scale inversely proportional to the rate of
incoming electrons for a given GEM voltage or gain. For a GEM voltage of 400 V, both methods described above could
be applied to verify the behavior over a wide range of rates, with characteristic times varying by more than two orders
of magnitude. For a lower voltage of 350 V, only the X-ray tube could be used as a clean 55Fe spectrum could not be
observed.

In order to compare measurements performed at different X-ray interaction rates and also at different GEM gains, we
switch to characteristic quantities describing either the number of incoming electrons per hole or the total number of
electrons inside the hole, both within a time span of one time constant. While both characteristic quantities are found to
agree within uncertainties for the two groups of measurements at 350 V and 400 V, we observe signiﬁcant differences
when comparing measurements at different voltages/gains. Assuming that the different gains at different GEM voltages
would be taken into account by considering the characteristic total number of electrons inside the GEM hole, we ﬁnd

In the future, we plan to investigate the inﬂuence of the GEM voltage on the time constant of the charging-up effect
in more detail, also taking into account external parameters like water content. We will also address the question
whether the external ﬁelds — drift ﬁeld and induction ﬁeld — also inﬂuence the charging-up behaviour. As previous
publications have claimed to observe different signatures for different hole shapes (e.g. single-conical holes), it is
interesting to investigate the charging-up effect for these foils as well. In addition, we are currently performing detailed
simulations in order to better understand the microscopic details of the charging-up effect.
