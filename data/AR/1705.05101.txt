Abstract: The study of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase argon is relevant in the ﬁeld
of noble-gas liquid detectors for dark matter search and low-energy neutrino experiments. In this
work, we continued to study proportional electroluminescence (EL) in two-phase argon doped with
a minor (9 ppm) admixture of nitrogen, in the VUV, UV and visible spectral ranges. We conﬁrmed
the eﬀect of enhancement of the EL yield, as well as the presence of non-VUV component in
addition to that of VUV, in proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar. On the other hand,
the contribution of non-VUV component determined here within the model of N2 emission in the
UV, turned out to be insuﬃcient to explain the EL yield enhancement eﬀect. Accordingly, the
problem of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar remains unresolved.

The study of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase argon is relevant in the ﬁeld of two-
phase detectors for dark matter search [1] and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering [2, 3] experi-
ments. In two-phase detectors, the S2 signal (induced by the primary ionization in the noble-gas
liquid), is detected through the eﬀect of proportional electroluminescence (or secondary scintil-
In
lation) in electroluminescence (EL) gap located directly above the liquid-gas interface [4].
proportional electroluminescence the energy provided to the electrons by the electric ﬁeld is almost
fully expended in atomic excitations producing Ar∗(3p54s1) states. These are followed by the pho-
ton emission in the Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV), around 128 nm, due to excimer (Ar∗
2) productions
in three-body collisions and their subsequent decays (see [5] and references therein).

In the presence of nitrogen admixture to gaseous argon the electroluminescence mechanism
might be modiﬁed. Namely, the excimer production (and hence the VUV emission) can be taken
over by that of excited N2 molecules (due to excitation transfer from Ar to N2 species), followed
by their de-excitations in the near Ultraviolet (UV) through the emission of the so-called Second
Positive System (2PS), at 310-430 nm [5]. Such a VUV-to-UV conversion, taking place directly in
the detector medium, would substantially enhance the photon collection eﬃciency for the S2 signal
due to avoiding problems with re-emission and total reﬂection losses in the Wavelength Shifter
(WLS) ﬁlm, which would be used otherwise.

It is known that in gaseous argon at room temperature such a VUV-to-UV conversion of
electroluminescence can be eﬀectively performed by doping with nitrogen at a relatively large
content, of 0.2-2% [6–8]. Recently proportional electroluminescence of gaseous Ar in the VUV
has for the ﬁrst time been studied at cryogenic temperatures, in the two-phase mode [9, 10]: the
EL yield was measured in Ar, with a minor (≤50 ppm) admixture of N2 that might be typical for
large-scale liquid Ar experiments. The EL yield was found to be substantially enhanced, by a factor
of 2.7 [9], compared to that measured at room temperature [11] and to that expected from the theory
[12]. This enhancement was explained by a hypothesis that 50% of emitted photons were due to N2
2PS emission in the near UV: a fraction of such an emission was assumed to be recorded directly,
i.e. escaping re-emission in the WLS ﬁlm and thus to have a considerably higher photon collection
eﬃciency.

This hypothesis implies that the excitation transfer from Ar to N2 species is substantially
enhanced at 87 K compared to room temperature. On the other hand, the comprehensive analysis
of energy levels, photon emission bands and reaction rate constants in two-phase Ar doped with N2,
performed recently in [5], tends us to believe that such hypothesis can hardly be true at such a small
N2 content, leading to the conclusion that the experimental data of [9] were incorrectly interpreted.
In this paper, we will attempt to identify the problem, in particular we will try to reproduce the
experimental results of [9] and to understand what the mystery of proportional electroluminescence
in two-phase Ar is.

The present study was performed in the course of the development of two-phase Cryogenic

Avalanche Detectors (CRADs) of ultimate sensitivity for rare-event experiments [13–19].

2 Experimental setup and measurement procedures

The experimental setup of the present work was used in the measurement session of 2016; it was
similar to that used in our previous measurements in 2015 [9, 10]: see ﬁgure 1. The setup included
a 9 l cryogenic chamber ﬁlled with 2.5 liters of liquid Ar with a minor (9 ppm) admixture of N2. The
detector was operated in a two-phase mode in the equilibrium state, at a saturated vapor pressure of
1.000±0.003 atm and at a temperature of 87.3 K. During each cooling procedure Ar was puriﬁed
from electronegative impurities by Oxisorb ﬁlter, providing electron life-time in the liquid >100 µs
[10].

Figure 1. Schematic view of the experimental setup (not to scale). The resistors of the voltage divider have
the following values: R1, R2, R3 and R4 is 80, 40, 4 and 600 MΩ respectively.

The cryogenic chamber comprised a cathode electrode, two ﬁeld-shaping electrodes and a
thick GEM (THGEM0), immersed in a 55 mm thick liquid Ar layer. These four elements were
biased through a resistive high-voltage divider placed within the liquid, forming a drift region in
liquid Ar, 48 mm long. A 4 mm thick liquid Ar layer above the THGEM0 acted as an electron

A double-THGEM was placed in the gas phase above the liquid. The EL gap (the
EL region), 18 mm thick, was formed by the liquid surface and the THGEM1 plate; the latter was
grounded through a resistor acting as an anode of the gap. All electrodes had the same active area,
of 10×10 cm2. The voltage applied to the divider varied from 11 to 22 kV, producing the electric
drift ﬁeld in liquid Ar of 0.34-0.68 kV/cm, electric emission ﬁeld of 2.6-5.1 kV/cm and electric ﬁeld
in the EL gap of 4.0-8.0 kV/cm. The average drift time of the electrons across the drift, emission
and EL regions varied from about 25 to 35 µs, depending on the applied electric ﬁelds.

The EL gap was viewed by four compact 2-inch PMTs R6041-506MOD [17, 19], located on
the perimeter of the gap. To prevent discharges and ﬁeld penetration from the high-voltage region
of the EL gap, the PMTs were electrically insulated from the gap by a grounded mesh and an acrylic
protective box. To make the PMT sensitive to the VUV emission of pure Ar, four WLS ﬁlms based
on TPB (tetraphenyl-butadiene) in polystyrene matrix [22, 23] were deposited on the inner box
surface facing the EL gap in front of each PMT. In addition, the EL gap was viewed by a multi-pixel
photon counter (MPPC or SiPM) through an acrylic plate and double-THGEM assembly (the latter
acting as a shadow mask), with an overall spectral sensitivity ranging from the near UV (360 nm)
to the near IR (1000 nm): see ﬁgure 2.

with N2 (0.2%) in the near UV and visible range measured at room temperature and high (∼1 atm) pressure
[7] and that of the WLS [23].

To verify the reproducibility of the results, we have made two important modiﬁcations of the
setup as compared to that of [9, 10]: we replaced those setup elements, which might most strongly
aﬀect the accuracy of the EL yield measurements. Firstly, we completely replaced the PMT system,
including all the PMTs and the acrylic box with the WLS ﬁlms. Secondly, we replaced the MPPC
of [9, 10] with that of 13360-6050PE type [20], having a 4-fold larger active area (6x6 mm2) and
better characteristics at cryogenic temperatures, in particular a higher gain and smaller cross-talk.

namely the emission-spectrum-measurement technique using the gas analyzer "SVET" [25], in
contrast to [9, 10] where the Residual-Gas-Analyzer (RGA) technique was used. Similarly to
[9, 10], the N2 content was measured in the gas contained in the stainless steel bottle from which the
gas was liqueﬁed into the cryogenic chamber and collected back (by cooling the bottle with liquid
nitrogen), respectively before and after the cryogenic measurement. The N2 content measured this
way amounted to 9±3 ppm, corresponding to the content in the two-phase mode of about 9 and 24
ppm in the liquid and gas phase respectively (according to Raoult’s law).

Figure 3. Typical signals from the EL gap, induced by pulsed X-rays, at an electric ﬁeld of 6.84 kV/cm in
the EL gap and 0.59 kV/cm in the drift region. These are shown on the left: the summed optical signal from
the four PMTs, the charge signal from the gap anode (THGEM1) and the optical signal from the MPPC. The
distributions of the PMT and THGEM1 amplitudes (pulse time-integral or pulse area) and that of the MPPC
(pulse double time-integral) are shown on the right, together with the electronics noise spectra.

The detector was irradiated from outside through a collimator and two aluminium windows
(each 1 mm thick) by X-rays from a pulsed X-ray tube with Mo anode operated at a voltage of
40 kV (at a rate of 240 Hz) [18]. The X-ray pulse was strong enough, to provide a measurable
ionization charge in the EL gap (tens of thousands electrons), and suﬃciently fast (0.5 µs), to
provide a reasonable time resolution.

Three types of signals were recorded from the EL gap: the optical signal from the PMTs, the

– 4 –

 charge signal from the THGEM1 acting as an anode of the EL gap and the optical signal from the
MPPC (see ﬁgure 3). The optical signals from the four PMTs were linearly summed using CAEN
N625 unit; they were ampliﬁed with a linear ampliﬁer with a shaping time of 200 ns. The THGEM1
charge signals were recorded using charge-sensitive and shaping ampliﬁers with an overall time
constant of 1 µs. The MPPC optical signals were recorded using a fast ampliﬁer with a shaping
time of 40 ns.

The amplitude of the PMT signal was expressed in the numbers of photoelectrons (p.e.) by
measuring the area (single time-integral) of the pulse in its selected part, positive and free from
electrical pickups (PMT pulse zoom in ﬁgure 3), divided by the area of the appropriate part of the
single-electron pulse. The latter was determined in special measurements using PMT noise signals
(ﬁgure 4, left) and PMT gain dependence on voltage (ﬁgure 4, right).

The amplitude of the THGEM1 signal was expressed in the numbers of electrons by measuring
the area of the pulse in its selected part, positive and free from electrical pickups (THGEM1 pulse
zoom in ﬁgure 3), using ampliﬁer circuit calibration, the latter procedure including the charge
injection with the help of a pulse generator and a precise capacitance.

Figure 4. Left: Single-photoelectron pulse-amplitude (pulse-area) distribution of the noise signals of one
of the PMTs; electronics noise spectrum is also shown. Right: PMT gain averaged over the four PMTs, in
terms of the averaged PMT single p.e. amplitude, as a function of the voltage applied to the PMT divider.

The MPPC signal was essentially bipolar, reﬂecting the characteristic response of the fast
ampliﬁer. Accordingly, we had to apply the double time-integration to correctly determine the
signal amplitude, since the single time-integral tended to zero at given time scales (5 µs/div): see
ﬁgure 3. Similarly to [26], this technique permitted assessing the total amplitudes of long MPPC
signals, consisting of multiple short single-p.e. pulses separated in time; a typical example of such
signal is shown in ﬁgure 3. On the other hand, in this method the expression of the MPPC amplitude
in the p.e. number turned out to be diﬃcult, since the single p.e. amplitude at such a large time
scale was not easy to determine: due ﬂuctuations of the zero-level at large time scales, the single
p.e. peaks were eroded so that they became indistinguishable. To overcome this problem, we had to
measure the single p.e. amplitude at shorter times and extrapolate it to larger time scales. However
this procedure was not that accurate. In this work we applied a new improved procedure to associate

counted the number of p.e. peaks in the pulse waveforms on a limited data set and related it to the
measured amplitude.

It should be remarked that the MPPC single p.e. amplitude in our previous work [9] was
measured at much shorter integration times than those used in the EL yield measurements, and thus
was essentially underestimated. This resulted in the overestimated MPPC amplitude, which in turn
lead to the overestimated contribution of the N2 2PS emission component to the overall EL yield,
as will be discussed in the next section.

The sensitivity of the two-phase detector with EL gap is characterized by the EL gap yield. In
our case it can be deﬁned as the number of photoelectrons recorded by the PMTs or MPPC (Npe),
per drifting electron in the EL gap: Ygap = Npe/Ne. Here Ne is the charge expressed in the number
of electrons, drifting in the EL gap and producing proportional electroluminescence.

Figure 2 presents optical spectra of the PMT Quantum Eﬃciency (QE) [20, 21], MPPC Photon
Detection Eﬃciency (PDE) [16, 20], acrylic plate transmittance (measured by us) and WLS (TPB in
polystyrene) hemispherical transmittance [22]. In addition, the EL emission spectrum of Ar doped
with N2, namely the 2PS spectrum [7], and the emission spectrum of the WLS (TPB in polystyrene)
[23] are presented. These data were used to determine the absolute EL yield.

The absolute EL yield is deﬁned as the number of emitted photons (Nph) normalized to the

number of drifting electrons producing electroluminescence and to the electron drift path (d):

YE L = Nph/Ne/d .

The number of photons recorded by the PMTs or MPPC is deﬁned as

Nph = Npe/PCE .

Here PCE is the photon-to-photoelectron conversion eﬃciency. For PMTs, it is equal to PCE =
ε < CE >< QE > for the VUV and UV (N2 2PS) components re-emitted by the WLS and PCE =
ε < QE > for the UV component recorded directly. For MPPC, it is equal to PCE = ε < PDE >.
Here ε is the photon collection eﬃciency, < CE > the WLS conversion eﬃciency averaged over
the VUV (pure Ar) or UV (N2 2PS) emission spectrum, < QE > and < PDE > the PMT QE and
MPPC PDE averaged over the WLS or N2 2PS emission spectrum and appropriately convoluted with
the WLS hemispherical or acrylic plate transmittance spectrum (ﬁgure 2). In particular, PMT QE
averaged over the WLS emission spectrum is < QE >= 26.6%, PMT QE averaged over the N2 2PS
emission spectrum and convoluted with the WLS hemispherical transmittance is < QE >= 5.1%
and MPPC PDE averaged over the N2 2PS emission spectrum and convoluted with the acrylic plate
transmittance is < PDE >= 18.1%. Also, we used CE = 0.58 around 128 nm [23], CE = 0.40 at
300-400 nm [22–24] and CE = 0 above 400 nm.

The photon collection eﬃciencies were calculated using several Monte-Carlo simulation pro-
cedures. The ﬁrst and the second ones simulated the emission of the photons in the EL gap of either
the VUV (128 nm) or the UV (N2 2PS) component absorbed in the WLS. The latter amounted to
85% of the N2 2PS, at 300-400 nm, obtained from convolution of the N2 2PS emission and WLS
hemispherical transmittance spectra of ﬁgure 2. The propagation of photons to the WLS ﬁlm, their
conversion there to the visible light photons and their further propagation to the PMT photocathodes
were simulated.

The third procedure simulated the emission of the photons of the UV (N2 2PS) component
escaping absorption in the WLS (amounting to 15% of the N2 2PS, at 400-450 nm) and thus directly
propagating to the PMTs. The photon-to-photoelectron conversion eﬃciency for this component
turned out to be considerably higher than that of the light re-emitted by the WLS, by about a factor
of 20, due to the absence of re-emission and total internal reﬂection losses.

The fourth procedure simulated the emission of the photons of the UV (N2 2PS) component
and their propagation to the MPPC through the double-THGEM, protective grid and acrylic plate
(amounting to 31% of the N2 SPS, at 360-450 nm).

Because of the critical dependence of the absolute photon yield on given simulation procedures,
the latter were carried out in two ways using diﬀerent program codes: that of developed ourselves
and that using photon tracing facility of Geant4 software package. The two ways were consistent
with an uncertainty of 20%, which was ﬁnally included in systematic error.

The results of these simulation procedures are presented in table 1 showing the values of ε,

<QE>, <PDE> and PCE for appropriate emission components.

Other details of the experimental setup and measurement procedures were described elsewhere

[9, 10].

3 Experimental results

In the previous paper [9], it was two observations that prompted us to propose a hypothesis about
the enhancement of the N2 2PS emission in two-phase Ar. The ﬁrst observation is related to the
excess of the EL yield compared to that expected from the theory, by a factor of 2.7, within the
"pure Ar" approach, i.e. when the photon emission is fully attributed to that of Ar∗
2 excimers in the
VUV. The second observation is related to the presence of the MPPC signal, directly indicating on
the existence of emission component in the non-VUV (see ﬁgure 2 for spectra reference).

Figure 5. Reduced EL yield in the VUV as a function of the reduced electric ﬁeld, obtained in two-phase
Ar within the "pure Ar" approach. Shown are the data of the present work obtained in 2016 in Ar+N2 (9
ppm), those of our previous work obtained in 2015 in Ar+N2 (≤49 ppm) (Bondar et al. [9]) and the data
point deduced from the work of Sangiorgio et al. [27] obtained in pure Ar. For comparison, the yields in
gaseous Ar in the VUV obtained experimentally at 293 K (Monteiro et al. [11]) and theoretically (Oliveira
et al. [12]) are presented.

The ﬁrst observation, i.e. the "pure Ar" approach, is illustrated in ﬁgure 5, showing the reduced
EL yield (YE L/N) as a function of the reduced electric ﬁeld (E/N). On the one hand, one can see
that the data of the present work strongly support the result of our previous work that the EL yield in
two-phase Ar is substantially enhanced (by a factor of 2-3) compared to that predicted by the theory
and to that measured at room temperature. On the other hand, there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in N2
content between the present data (of 2016) and the previous data (of 2015): 9 ppm versus 49 ppm.
This fact indicates that the enhancement eﬀect might not be related to N2 dopant, in contrast to that
assumed in [9]. These conclusions are also supported by the data point of another group obtained
for pure Ar, deduced by us from the work [27] and shown in ﬁgure 5.

The second observation is illustrated in ﬁgure 6, showing the EL gap yield measured using
PMT and MPPC signals. On the one hand, we conﬁrm here the presence of MPPC signal observed
in our previous work [9], consequently conﬁrming the existence of non-VUV emission. To move
forward, we have to adopt a certain model for this non-VUV component. An exhaustive description
of sources of non-VUV emission in two-phase Ar doped with N2 and Xe can be found elsewhere
[5], presenting comprehensive analysis of energy levels, photon emission bands and reaction rate
constants. In the PMT sensitivity region, all such sources are related to N2 emission, namely to
that of 2PS or 1PS (ﬁrst positive system) due to N∗
2(B) excited states respectively, the
ﬁrst source being preferred according to reaction kinetic analysis. Also, emission in the NIR (near
infrared) can not be related to this non-VUV component, since NIR electroluminescence starts at
much higher ﬁelds [14]. Given no other rational assumptions, we adopt here the hypothesis of N2
2PS origin of non-VUV emission, similarly to [9].

in the UV within the "Ar+N2" approach (i.e. due to N2 2PS emission) to the PMT signal, deduced from the
EL yield using MPPC signal.

On the other hand, when we estimated the contribution of this UV (N2 2PS) component to the
PMT signal, it turned out to be a factor of 6 smaller than that reported in [9]: see ﬁgure 6. We
think that this discrepancy is due to the fact that the MPPC single p.e. amplitude in our previous
work [9] was essentially underestimated, leading to overestimated MPPC amplitude, as discussed
in the previous section. Accordingly, the UV contribution amounts to 14% only, the rest of the
PMT signal being attributed to VUV component.

Figure 7 shows the reduced EL yield in two-phase Ar, obtained within this "Ar+N2" approach,
i.e. in the VUV and UV assuming that the latter component (recorded via MPPC) is due to N2 2PS
emission. In this approach, the discrepancy with the theory for the VUV emission still remains
quite signiﬁcant, of a factor of 2.

The linear dependence of the EL yield in the VUV (Ar∗

2 excimer emission) and in the UV

2(C) 2PS emission) on the electric ﬁeld (ﬁgure 7) is described by the following equations:

(N∗

YE L/N = 0.231E/N − 1.024 ,

YE L/N = 0.008E/N − 0.026 .

The slope of the line deﬁnes the ampliﬁcation parameter of proportional electroluminescence. It
amounts to 231±13 and 8±1 photons per kV in the VUV and UV respectively.

We may conclude, that the contribution of UV component is insuﬃcient to explain the en-
hancement eﬀect of the PMT signal, in contrast to [9] and in accordance with theoretical analysis
of [5]. As a result, the situation with interpretation of data becomes even more confusing than it
was in the previous work [9]. We still remain with the following two questions for proportional
electroluminescence in two-phase Ar which we cannot explain at the moment:
the eﬀect of EL
yield enhancement in the VUV and the origin of non-VUV emission.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we continued to study the problem of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase
Ar doped with N2, with the intention of verifying the data of our previous work [9]. On the
one hand, the results of present work conﬁrm the eﬀect of EL yield enhancement in two-phase
Ar observed in [9]. We also conﬁrm the presence of non-VUV component in addition to that of
VUV, in proportional electroluminescence. On the other hand, the contribution of UV component
determined here within the model of N2 2PS emission, turned out to be insuﬃcient to explain the
enhancement eﬀect, in contrast to [9] and in accordance with theoretical analysis of [5].

Finally, the present study helped us to identify the problem: at the moment we cannot explain
the mystery of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar; it is to be resolved in future
studies.
