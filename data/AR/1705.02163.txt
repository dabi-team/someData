CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES AND
COHEN-MACAULAY-FINITE ALGEBRAS

HARUHISA ENOMOTO

Abstract. We give a classiﬁcation of all exact structures on a given idempotent complete ad-
ditive category. Using this, we investigate the structure of an exact category with ﬁnitely many
indecomposables. We show that the relation of the Grothendieck group of such a category is
generated by AR conﬂations. Moreover, we obtain an explicit classiﬁcation of (1) Gorenstein-
projective-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras, (2) Cohen-Macaulay-ﬁnite orders, and more gen-
erally, (3) cotilting modules U with ⊥U of ﬁnite type.
In the appendix, we develop the AR
theory of exact categories over a noetherian complete local ring, and relate the existence of AR
conﬂations to the AR duality and dualizing varieties.

1. Introduction

In the representation theory of ﬁnite-dimensional algebras, one of the most important subjects
is to classify certain categories of ﬁnite type. Here we say that an additive k-category over a ﬁeld
k is of ﬁnite type if it has only ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects up to isomorphism. The aim
of this paper is to give a classiﬁcation of exact categories of ﬁnite type, and thereby provide an
explicit classiﬁcation of all GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras. Let us explain the motivation
for this.

H. ENOMOTO

First we recall how categories of ﬁnite type have been studied in the representation theory.
It is well-known that an abelian Hom-ﬁnite k-category of ﬁnite type is nothing but the category
mod Λ of ﬁnitely generated Λ-modules over some representation-ﬁnite k-algebra Λ (see [Ga2, 8.2]
or Proposition 3.14 below). A classiﬁcation of such algebras is one of the main problems in
the representation theory of algebras, and has been studied widely by a number of papers, e.g.
[Ga1, Ri, BGRS, GR]. For the case of representation-ﬁnite R-orders over a noetherian local ring
R, we refer the reader to [Ar, DK, HN, LW, RVdB2, Yo]. Besides abelian categories, triangulated
in [Am]. Such triangulated categories
categories of ﬁnite type also has been investigated, e.g.
naturally arise in the representation of algebras and in the categoriﬁcation of cluster algebras.

Among other things, the observation by Auslander [Au2] is of particular importance to us when
we deal with categories of ﬁnite type. Let E be a Hom-ﬁnite k-category of ﬁnite type and consider
the algebra Γ := EndE (M ), where M is a direct sum of all non-isomorphic indecomposables in E.
This Γ is called an Auslander algebra of E, and categorical properties of E should be related to
homological properties of Γ. For example, the condition E being abelian is equivalent to a certain
homological condition of Γ, that is, gl.dim Γ ≤ 2 ≤ dom.dim Γ. This is called the Auslander
correspondence, and is now the basic and important viewpoint in the representation theory.

However, most of the algebras are representation-wild, and it is hopeless to understand the
whole structure of the module category. Thus nice subcategories of module categories has attracted
much attention. For example, in the representation theory of a commutative noetherian local ring
R, the category CM R of Cohen-Macaulay modules has played a central role. For an Iwanaga-
Gorenstein ring (two-sided noetherian ring satisfying id(ΛΛ) = id(ΛΛ) < ∞), we have the natural
notion of Cohen-Macaulay Λ-modules (which we call Gorenstein-projective Λ-modules to avoid
any confusion). In the spirit of Auslander’s observation, it is natural to ask whether there exists
an Auslander-type correspondence for GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras (algebras Λ such
that GP Λ is of ﬁnite type). In this paper, we give an answer to this problem.

It is known that an algebra Γ is the GP-Auslander-algebra of some Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra if
and only if the global dimension of Γ is ﬁnite (see e.g. Proposition 4.6 below or [Ka, Proposition 4]).
In fact, if Γ has ﬁnite global dimension, then Γ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein and satisﬁes GP Γ = proj Γ.
Thus Γ is GP-ﬁnite and Γ is its own GP-Auslander algebra. However, there may exist another
GP-ﬁnite algebra Λ which satisﬁes GP Λ ≃ GP Γ (consider for example a representation-ﬁnite
selﬁnjective algebra Λ and its usual Auslander algebra Γ). Therefore, the GP-Auslander-algebra
alone is not enough to classify GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras.

In Theorem A, we classify GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras by algebras with ﬁnite global

dimension together with their modules satisfying a certain condition, given as follows.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let Γ be a two-sided noetherian ring and S a simple right Γ-module. We say
that S satisﬁes the 2-regular condition if the following conditions are satisﬁed.

(1) pd SΓ = 2.
(2) Exti
(3) Ext2

Γ(S, Γ) = 0 for i = 0, 1.
Γ(S, Γ) is a simple left Γ-module.

This condition is satisﬁed by the simple modules over commutative regular local rings of di-
mension 2, and their non-commutative analogues, e.g. Artin-Schelter regular algebras, Calabi-Yau
algebras, non-singular orders of dimension 2.

For a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra Γ, we interpret the 2-regular condition in terms of the trans-
lation quiver Q(Γ). This is the usual quiver of Γ together with dotted arrows corresponding to
the simple Γ-modules with the 2-regular condition (Deﬁnition 3.9). Using these concepts, we
obtain the following classiﬁcation, where a Γ-module is called basic if its indecomposable direct
summands are pairwise non-isomorphic.

Theorem A (= Corollary 4.9). There exists a bijection between the following for a ﬁeld k.

(1) Morita equivalence classes of GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebras

Λ.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES

(2) Equivalence classes of pairs (Γ, M ), where Γ is a ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra with ﬁnite
global dimension and M is a basic semisimple Γ-module such that every simple summand of
M satisﬁes the 2-regular condition and Homk(M, k) ∼= Ext2
Γ(M, Γ) holds as left Γ-modules.
(3) Equivalence classes of pairs (Γ, X), where Γ is a ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra with ﬁnite

global dimension and X is a union of stable τ -orbits in Q(Γ).

For a pair (Γ, X) in (3), the corresponding algebra Λ in (1) is given by the endomorphism ring of
the direct sum of the indecomposable projective Γ-modules which does not belong to τ -orbits in X.

As Example 1.2 illustrates, it provides a systematic method to construct a family of GP-ﬁnite

Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras.

To prove Theorem A, we need the notion of exact categories, which was introduced by Quillen
[Qu] as a generalization of abelian categories. It provides an appropriate framework for a relative
homological algebra and has a number of applications in many branches of mathematics, such as
representation theory, algebraic topology and functional analysis. Let us explain why the use of
exact structures is essential in our classiﬁcation. In the classical situation, we can recover Λ (up to
Morita equivalence) only from the additive structure of mod Λ, while this fails to be true for GP Λ
as mentioned above. Even in this case, Λ can be recovered from the exact structure of GP Λ, as
the endomorphism ring of the progenerator of it. In Theorem A, the algebra Γ gives the additive
structure of GP Λ, while the module M or the set X gives the exact structure on it. In this setting,
the quiver Q(Γ) with dotted arrow X is nothing but the Auslander-Reiten quiver of GP Λ.

Example 1.2. Let Γ be the algebra given by the quiver in Figure 1, where we identify two
vertical arrows, with commutativity and zero relations indicated by dotted lines. Then Γ has
ﬁnite global dimension and the translation quiver Q(Γ) is the same as Figure 1. It has two stable
τ -orbits A and B, hence we obtain four GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras, corresponding to
the endomorphism rings of vertices which does not belong to X. Table 1 is an explicit calculation
of all GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras Λ such that GP Λ is equivalent to proj Γ.

Figure 1. The quiver of Γ (or equivalently, proj Γ).

To deal with exact structures, we mainly work with idempotent complete additive categories
instead of categories of ﬁnite type. For such a category E, we classify all exact structures on E
in terms of its functor category mod E. The precise statement is the following, where C2(E) is the
category of E-modules whose projective dimension and grade are equal to 2.

Theorem B (= Theorem 2.7). Let E be an idempotent complete additive category. Then there
exists a bijection between the following two classes.

(1) Exact structures on E.
(2) Subcategories D of C2(E) satisfying the following conditions.

(a) D is a Serre subcategory of mod E.
(b) Ext2

E(D, E) is a Serre subcategory of mod E op.

It is surprising to us that such a general description of all exact structures is available. For
example, the existence theorem of the largest exact structure due to [Ru2] easily follows from
Theorem B in the case of idempotent complete categories.

We apply Theorem B to exact categories of ﬁnite type, which is our motivating object. When
E is a Hom-ﬁnite idempotent complete k-category of ﬁnite type, we show that exact structures on
E bijectively correspond to sets of simple Γ-modules satisfying the 2-regular condition, and sets of
dotted arrows of Q(Γ), where Γ is the Auslander algebra of E (Theorem 3.7 and Corollary 3.10).

We apply this result to obtain Theorem A, and more generally, an Auslander correspondence
for cotilting modules U such that ⊥U is of ﬁnite type (Theorem 4.8). As another application, we
obtain the following Auslander correspondence for representation-ﬁnite R-orders in case dim R ≥ 2.
This improves [Iy3, Theorem 4.2.3] for the case n = 1, because our result gives a bijection for
representation-ﬁnite orders and some assumptions on Γ in [Iy3, Theorem 4.2.3] are dropped.

Theorem C (= Corollary 4.11). Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring with dim R =
d ≥ 2. Then there exists a bijection between the following.

(1) Morita equivalence classes of R-orders Λ such that CM Λ is of ﬁnite type.
(2) Equivalence classes of pairs (Γ, e), where Γ is a noetherian R-algebra and e is an idempo-

tent of Γ such that the following conditions are satisﬁed.
(a) gl.dim Γ = d.
(b) Γe is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module.
(c) Γ := Γ/ΓeΓ is of ﬁnite length over R.
(d) Γ/(rad Γ) is a direct sum of simple Γ-modules satisfying the 2-regular condition.

Also, we investigate the Grothendieck group K0(E) of an exact category E of ﬁnite type, and
show that the relation of K0(E) is generated by AR conﬂations under some mild conditions (Corol-
lary 3.18). This uniﬁes several known results by [AR2, But, Yo].

The appendix contains a brief discussion of the Auslander-Reiten theory for exact categories
which are Hom-noetherian over a noetherian complete local ring R. We show that the existence
of AR conﬂations is closely related to the AR duality and dualizing R-varieties (Theorem A.9).
These observations shed new light on the result on isolated singularities by Auslander [Au4], see
Remark A.10.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we state and prove our main classiﬁcation.
In Section 3, we investigate exact categories of ﬁnite type. In Section 4, we apply our previous
results to the study of the representation theory of algebras.

1.1. Conventions. Throughout this paper, we assume that all categories are skeletally small, that
is, the isomorphism classes of objects form a set. In addition, all subcategories are assumed to be
full and closed under isomorphisms. By a module we always mean right modules unless otherwise
stated. As for exact categories, we use the terminologies inﬂations, deﬂations and conﬂations. We
refer the reader to [B¨u] for the basics of exact categories.

2. Classifying exact structures via Serre subcategories

In this section, we give a bijection between exact structures on an idempotent complete additive
category E and subcategories of mod E satisfying certain “2-regular condition.” Throughout this
section, we always assume that E is an additive category.

Recall that an additive category E is idempotent complete if every morphism e : X → X in E
satisfying e2 = e has a kernel, or equivalently, a cokernel. For example, every subcategory of an
abelian category which is closed under direct sums and direct summands are idempotent complete.

2.1. Preliminaries on functor categories. Our strategy to investigate exact structures on E
is to study the module category Mod E over E. Let us recall related deﬁnitions.

For an additive category E, a right E-module M is a contravariant additive functor M : E op →
Ab from E to the category of abelian groups Ab. We denote by Mod E the category of right
E-modules, and morphisms in Mod E are natural transformations between them. This category
Mod E is an abelian category with enough projectives, and projective objects are precisely direct
summands of (possibly inﬁnite) direct sums of representable functors. For simplicity, we put PX :=
E(−, X) ∈ Mod E and P X := E(X, −) ∈ Mod E op for any X in E. Note that P(−) : E → Mod E
gives the Yoneda embedding.

We say that a E-module M is ﬁnitely generated if there exists an epimorphism PX ։ M for
some X in E. Throughout this paper, we often use the fact that E is idempotent complete if
and only if the essential image of the Yoneda embedding P(−) : E → Mod E consists of all ﬁnitely
generated projective E-modules. We denote by mod E the category of ﬁnitely generated E-modules.
We also denote by mod1 E the category of ﬁnitely presented E-modules, that is, the modules M
such that there exists an exact sequence PX → PY → M → 0 for some X, Y in E.

We deﬁne a contravariant functor HomE (−, E) : Mod E → Mod E op by the following way: For M
in Mod E, the left E-module HomE (M, E) : E → Ab is the composition of the Yoneda embedding
E → Mod E and (Mod E)(M, −) : Mod E → Ab. Note that HomE (−, E) is a left exact functor
satisfying HomE (P(−), E) ≃ P (−). We denote by Exti
E (−, E) : Mod E → Mod E op the i-th right
derived functor of HomE (−, E).

Using these concepts, we can interpret kernel-cokernel pairs in terms of modules over E. Here
g
−→ Z in E is a kernel-cokernel pair if f is a kernel of g and g is a

f
−→ Y

we say that a complex X
cokernel of f .

Proposition 2.1. Let X
following hold.

f
−→ Y

g
−→ Z be a complex in E. Put M := Coker(Pg) ∈ Mod E. Then the

(1) g is an epimorphism in E if and only if HomE (M, E) = 0.

(2) X

f
−→ Y

g
−→ Z is a kernel-cokernel pair if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed.

(a) 0 → PX
(b) Exti

E(M, E) = 0 for i = 0, 1.

Pf−−→ PY

Pg−−→ PZ → M → 0 is exact.

Proof. (1) We have an exact sequence 0 → HomE(M, E) → P Z P g
if and only if P g is a monomorphism if and only if HomE (M, E) = 0.

−−→ P Y . Thus g is an epimorphism

(2) The condition (a) is equivalent to that f is a kernel of g. Under (a), the condition (b) is
−−→ P X is exact, which holds precisely when g is a cokernel
(cid:3)

equivalent to that 0 → P Z P g
of f .

−−→ P Y P f

We need the following technical lemma later.

Lemma 2.2. Suppose that E is idempotent complete and there exists an exact sequence

0 → PX → PY → PZ → M → 0
in Mod E. For any morphism h : B → C with Coker(Ph) ∼= M , there exists an object A in E such
that Ker Ph ∼= PA.
Proof. Schanuel’s lemma shows that Ker Ph ⊕ PY ⊕ PC ∼= PX ⊕ PB ⊕ PZ, which clearly implies that
(cid:3)
Ker Ph is ﬁnitely generated projective. Since E is idempotent complete, the assertion holds.

2.2. Construction of maps. First we ﬁx some notations which we need to describe our main
theorem. The following observation follows immediately from Proposition 2.1.

Lemma 2.3. For an object M in Mod E, the following are equivalent.

(1) There exists a kernel-cokernel pair X → Y

g
−→ Z in E such that M is isomorphic to

Coker(Pg).

(2) There exists an exact sequence 0 → PX → PY → PZ → M → 0 in Mod E and Exti

E (M, E) =

0 for i = 0, 1.

We denote by C2(E) the subcategory of Mod E consisting of E-modules satisfying the above

equivalent conditions. This class of modules play an indispensable role throughout this paper.

Lemma 2.4. The category C2(E) is closed under direct summands in Mod E.

Proof. We denote by mod2 E the subcategory of Mod E consisting of all objects M such that there
exists an exact sequence

P2 → P1 → P0 → M → 0

in Mod E, where each Pi is ﬁnitely generated projective.

In [Ki, Lemma 2.5(a)], it was shown that mod2 E is closed under summands in Mod E. Note

that C2(E) is equal to the intersection of two subcategories of mod2 E:

(1) the subcategory consisting of all objects whose projective dimensions are at most 2 and
(2) the subcategory consisting of all objects M such that Exti

E (M, E) = 0 for i = 0, 1.

Since these subcategories are closed under direct summands in Mod E, so is C2(E).
Lemma 2.5. The functor Ext2

E(−, E) induces a duality of exact categories C2(E) → C2(E op).

Proof. The same proof as in [Iy1, 6.2(1)] applies here.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

By deﬁnition, the category C2(E) is closely related to kernel-cokernel pairs of E. Indeed, we

have two maps between them, as we shall construct below.

Suppose that F is a class of kernel-cokernel pairs in E. We say that a complex X

g
−→ Z is
an F -exact if it belongs to F . In this case, we say that f is an F -monomorphism and that g is an
F -epimorphism.

f
−→ Y

Deﬁnition 2.6. (1) Let D be a subcategory of C2(E). We denote by F (D) the class of all com-

plexes X

f
−→ Y

g
−→ Z which satisfy the following condition:

There exists an exact sequence 0 → PX
belongs to D.

Pf−−→ PY

Pg−−→ PZ → M → 0 in Mod E such that M

(2) Let F be a class of kernel-cokernel pairs in E. We denote by D(F ) the subcategory of Mod E

consisting of all objects M which satisfy the following condition:
There exists an F -exact complex X

g
−→ Z satisfying M ∼= Coker(Pg).

f
−→ Y

The category D(F ) can be seen as the category of contravariant defects of F -exact sequences,

in the sense of Auslander (see [ARS, IV.4]). Note that by Lemma 2.3, the following hold.

• Every complex X
• Every object M in D(F ) is in C2(E).

f
−→ Y

g
−→ Z in F (D) is a kernel-cokernel pair.

2.3. Main theorem. In this subsection, we will state our main theorem and give a proof. Recall
that a Serre subcategory of an exact category E is an additive subcategory D of E such that for
all conﬂations L ֌ M ։ N in E, the object M belongs to D if and only if both L and N belong
to D.

Theorem 2.7. Let E be an idempotent complete additive category. Then there exist mutually
inverse bijections between the following two classes.

(1) Exact structures F on E.
(2) Subcategories D of C2(E) satisfying the following conditions.

(a) D is a Serre subcategory of mod E.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES

7

(b) Ext2

E(D, E) is a Serre subcategory of mod E op.

The map from (1) to (2) is given by F 7→ D(F ) and from (2) to (1) by D 7→ F (D) (see Deﬁnition
2.6).

To prove this, we ﬁrst show that the maps in Deﬁnition 2.6 induces a one-to-one correspondence

between wider classes than in Theorem 2.7.

Proposition 2.8. Let E be an additive category. Then the maps in Deﬁnition 2.6 induce mutually
inverse bijections between the following two classes.

(1) Classes of kernel-cokernel pairs F in E satisfying the following conditions.

(a) F is closed under homotopy equivalences of complexes.
(b) F is closed under direct sums of complexes.
(c) F is closed under direct summands of complexes.
(d) F is not empty.

(2) Subcategories D of C2(E) satisfying the following condition.

(a) D is closed under direct sums.
(b) D is closed under direct summands.
(c) D is not empty.

Proof. First we see that the maps in Deﬁnition 2.6 induces well-deﬁned maps between (1) and (2).
(1) → (2): Suppose that F is a class of kernel-cokernel pairs in E satisfying the conditions of
(1). We will see that D(F ) satisﬁes the conditions of (2). Clearly D(F ) satisﬁes (a) and (c) by the
conditions (1)(b) and (1)(d) respectively. Hence it suﬃces to show that D is closed under direct
summands.

Suppose that M1 ⊕ M2 is in D(F ). Then M1 ⊕ M2 is an object of C2(E), which is closed under

summands by Lemma 2.4. Therefore both M1 and M2 are in C2(E). This gives exact sequences

0 → PXi

Pfi−−→ PYi

Pgi−−→ PZi → Mi → 0

for some kernel-cokernel pairs Xi
these two complexes, we obtain a kernel-cokernel pair

fi−→ Yi

gi−→ Zi in E with i = 1, 2. By taking the direct sum of

X1 ⊕ X2

f1⊕f2
−−−−→ Y1 ⊕ Y2

g1⊕g2
−−−−→ Z1 ⊕ Z2.

Thereby we obtain the following exact sequence.

0 → PX1⊕X2

Pf1 ⊕Pf2
−−−−−−→ PY1⊕Y2

Pg1 ⊕Pg2
−−−−−−→ PZ1⊕Z2 → M1 ⊕ M2 → 0

On the other hand, since M1 ⊕ M2 is in D(F ), there exists an F -exact complex

f

g
−→ Z

X

(2.1)

(2.2)

in E such that

0 → PX

Pf−−→ PY

Pg−−→ PZ → M1 ⊕ M2 → 0

is exact. It is standard that two projective resolutions are homotopy equivalent to each other.
Thus the Yoneda lemma implies that (2.1) and (2.2) are homotopy equivalent to each other as
three-term complexes in E. Because F is closed under homotopy equivalences, (2.1) is F -exact.
By the condition (1)(c), we conclude that each gi is an F -epimorphism, which shows that M1 and
M2 are in D(F ).

(2) → (1): This is immediate and we leave the details to the reader.
Now we will show that the maps in Deﬁnition 2.6 are in fact inverse to each other. It is easy
to see that D = D(F (D)) in general. (Note that subcategories are always assumed to be closed
under isomorphisms.)

Suppose F is a class of kernel-cokernel pairs in E satisfying the conditions of (1). Put D := D(F ).

Then clearly we have F (D) ⊃ F . We will prove F (D) ⊂ F .

Suppose that we have an F (D)-exact sequence

is exact. Since the Yoneda embedding of (2.3) also yields a projective resolution for M , it follows
that (2.3) and (2.4) are homotopy equivalent to each other. Therefore (2.3) is an F -exact sequence,
(cid:3)
since F is closed under homotopy equivalences.

Now we are in the position to prove Theorem 2.7. First we recall the axiom of exact categories
following [B¨u, Deﬁnition 2.1]. Let F be a class of kernel-cokernel pairs in E which is closed under
isomorphisms. Consider the following conditions.
(Ex0) For all objects X ∈ E, the complex 0 → X = X is F -exact.
(Ex1) The class of F -epimorphisms are closed under compositions.
(Ex2) The pullback of an F -epimorphisms along an arbitrary morphism exists and yields an

F -epimorphism.

We say that (E, F ) is an exact category if F satisﬁes (Ex0)-(Ex2) and (Ex0)op-(Ex2)op. In this
case, F is called an exact structure on E, and we just call E an exact category if F is clear from
context. In an exact category (E, F ), we use the terminologies conﬂations, deﬂations and inﬂations
instead of F -exact sequences, F -epimorphisms and F -monomorphisms respectively.

Lemma 2.9. Let (E, F ) be an exact category. Then F satisﬁes all the conditions of Proposition
2.8(1).

Proof. The condition (1)(d) is satisﬁed by deﬁnition. The condition (1)(a) can be proved by the
Gabriel-Quillen embedding. We refer the reader to [B¨u, Proposition 2.9] and [B¨u, Corollary 2.18]
(cid:3)
for the conditions (1)(b) and (1)(c) respectively.

The following proposition is a technical part of the proof of Theorem 2.7.

Proposition 2.10. Suppose that E is idempotent complete and a class F satisﬁes the conditions

(1) F is an exact structure on E.

Thus we can apply 3 × 3 lemma in exact categories, see [B¨u, Corollary 3.6]. Thus the middle row

Proof of Theorem 2.7. It is immediate from Proposition 2.10 and Lemma 2.9.

The following description of projective objects in E in terms of D is needed later.

11

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.11. Let E be an idempotent complete exact category and D the corresponding
Serre subcategory of mod E given in Theorem 2.7. Then for an object Z in E, the following are
equivalent.

(1) W is projective in E.
(2) M (W ) = 0 for all object M ∈ D.

Proof. The category D consists of all functors M such that PY
some deﬂation g : Y ։ Z, so (2) is equivalent to that PY (W )
every deﬂation g. This occurs if and only if W is a projective object in E.

(cid:3)

Next let us consider the particular case when the simpler classiﬁcation is available. This includes

the case when E is abelian, or more generally, quasi-abelian (see [Ru1] for the detail).

Lemma 2.12. Let E be an idempotent complete category. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) C2(E) and C2(E op) are Serre subcategories of mod E and mod E op respectively.
(2) The class of all kernel-cokernel pairs in E deﬁnes an exact structure of E.

In this case, there exists a bijection between the following two classes.

(1) Exact structures on E.
(2) Serre subcategories of C2(E).

Proof. Let F be the class of all kernel-cokernel pairs in E. Then D(F ) = C2(E) holds, thus
(cid:3)
Proposition 2.10 applies. The latter part is clear from Theorem 2.7.

Now we will show that a more familiar description for D is available if E has enough projectives.
First we recall the notation of the projectively stable category of an exact category. Let E be an
exact category with enough projective objects. Denote by [P](X, Y ) the set of all morphisms from
X to Y which factor through projective objects in E. Then [P] is a two-sided ideal of E and we
denote by E := E/[P], which we call the projectively stable category.

Lemma 2.13. Let E be an exact category with enough projectives and D the subcategory of mod E
corresponding to all conﬂations (see Deﬁnition 2.6). Then D ≃ mod1 E holds.
Proof. We have an embedding mod1 E → mod E and denote its essential image by D′. We show
that the following conditions are equivalent for an object M in mod E.

(1) M ∈ D.
(2) There exist a deﬂation g : Y → Z in E and an exact sequence

E(−, Y )

(−)◦g
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → M → 0.

(2.7)

(3) M ∈ D′.
(1) ⇔ (2): This is easily shown by diagram chasing.
(2) ⇒ (3): Clear.
(3) ⇒ (2): Suppose that M is in D′. Since M is ﬁnitely presented E-module, we have an exact
sequence of the form (2.7) for some g : Y → Z. By assumption, there exists a deﬂation ϕ : P ։ Z
for some projective object P . Using this, we may replace g by [g, ϕ] : Y ⊕ P → Z, which is a
(cid:3)
deﬂation. This proves the claim.

Combining Lemma 2.12 and 2.13, we immediately obtain the following conclusion, which gives
a generalization of Buan’s result [Bua, Proposition 3.3.2], where E was assumed to be mod Λ for
some artin algebra Λ.

Corollary 2.14. Let E be an idempotent complete additive category such that the class of all
kernel-cokernel pairs deﬁnes an exact structure with enough projectives (e.g. abelian category with
enough projectives). Denote by E the projectively stable category in this exact structure. Then
there exists a bijection between the following two classes.

12

H. ENOMOTO

(1) Exact structures on E.
(2) Serre subcategories of mod1 E.

3. Exact categories of finite type

We use our previous results to classify idempotent complete exact categories of ﬁnite type. For
an additive category E, an object M is called an additive generator of E if add M = E holds, where
add M is the subcategory of E consisting of all direct summands of ﬁnite direct sums of M . We
call that an additive category E is of ﬁnite type if it has an additive generator.

We say that an additive category E is a Krull-Schmidt category if every object in E is a ﬁnite
direct sum of indecomposable objects whose endomorphism rings are local. For the basics of
Krull-Schmidt categories, we refer the reader to [Kr]. An additive category E is Krull-Schmidt
if and only if E is idempotent complete and EndE (X) is semiperfect for every X ∈ E.
If E is
Krull-Schmidt, then E is of ﬁnite type precisely when E has ﬁnitely many indecomposables up to
isomorphism.

Let M be an additive generator of E and Γ := EndE (M ). Then we have a fully faithful functor
E(M, −) : E → Mod Γ to the category of right Γ-modules. Its essential image coincides with the
category proj Γ of ﬁnitely generated projective Γ-modules precisely when E is idempotent complete.
Thus, when we deal with an idempotent complete additive category of ﬁnite type, we may assume
that E = proj Γ for some ring Γ. To avoid technical complications, we restrict our attention to the
case when Γ is a noetherian ring. Note that proj Γ is Krull-Schmidt if and only if Γ is semiperfect.

3.1. Basic properties. We start with reformulating our result in Section 3 in terms of the ring
Γ, where we use the same notation C2(Γ):

C2(Γ) := {M ∈ mod Γ | pd MΓ ≤ 2 and Exti

Γ(M, Γ) = 0 for i = 0, 1}.

Note that every non-zero module M in C2(Γ) satisﬁes pd MΓ = 2.

Theorem 3.1. Let Γ be a noetherian ring and put E := proj Γ. Then there exists a bijection
between the following two classes.
(1) Exact structures F on E.
(2) Subcategories D of C2(Γ) satisfying the following condition.

(a) D is a Serre subcategory of mod Γ.
(b) Ext2

Γ(D, Γ) is a Serre subcategory of mod Γop.

The correspondence is given as follows.

• For a given D, a complex X

−→ Z in E is in F if and only if 0 → X

M → 0 is an exact sequence in mod Γ with some M in D.

• For a given F , a Γ-module M ∈ mod Γ is in D if and only if there exists a deﬂation g in

E with M ∼= Coker g.

When we deal with exact structures on proj Γ, the 2-regular condition for simple modules (see
Deﬁnition 1.1) are quite essential. For the set S of simple Γ-modules, we denote by Filt S the
subcategory of mod Γ consisting of all modules M such that M has ﬁnite length and all composition
factors of M are contained in S. The following observation is useful.

Lemma 3.2. Let Γ be a noetherian ring and S a set of simple Γ-modules. Then the following are
equivalent.

(1) Every module in S satisﬁes the 2-regular condition.
(2) D := Filt S is contained in C2(Γ) and satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 3.1(2).
(3) There exists a subcategory D of C2(Γ) containing S such that D satisﬁes the conditions of

Theorem 3.1(2).

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Clearly S ∈ C2(Γ) holds for every S ∈ S. Since C2(Γ) is closed under exten-
sions in mod Γ, we have that Filt S is a Serre subcategory of mod Γ contained in C2(Γ). Since

Γ(S, Γ) is simple for every S ∈ S, we

Every additive category admits a trivial exact structure whose conﬂations are split exact se-
quences. We have the following criterion on the existence of non-trivial exact structures on proj Γ.

Proposition 3.3. Let Γ be a noetherian ring. Then proj Γ admits a non-trivial exact structure if
and only if there exists a simple Γ-module satisfying the 2-regular condition.

Proof. Suppose that there exists a simple Γ-module S satisfying the 2-regular condition. Then
Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.1 imply the existence of a non-trivial exact structure on proj Γ.

Conversely, suppose that proj Γ has a non-trivial exact structure. By Theorem 3.1, we have a
non-zero Serre subcategory D of mod Γ. Since any non-zero Γ-module in mod Γ has a surjection
onto simple Γ-module, D contains at least one simple Γ-module S. Then Lemma 3.2 implies that
(cid:3)
S satisﬁes the 2-regular condition.

Example 3.4. Let R be a commutative noetherian local ring. Then Proposition 3.3 implies
that there exists a non-trivial exact structure on proj R if and only if R is a regular local ring
of dimension 2. In this case, proj R has exactly one non-trivial exact structures. In this exact

−→ P1

3.2. Admissible exact structures. We introduce a nice class of exact categories which is com-
pletely controlled by the simple modules satisfying the 2-regular condition. For a ring Γ, we denote
by f.l. Γ the subcategory of mod Γ consisting of Γ-modules of ﬁnite length. Similarly, we denote
by f.l. E the category consisting of E-modules of ﬁnite length.

Deﬁnition 3.5. Let (E, F ) be an exact category and D the subcategory of mod E corresponding
to F under Theorem 2.7. We say that F is admissible if D ⊂ f.l. E holds.

Let (proj Γ, F ) be an exact category for a noetherian ring Γ and D the subcategory of mod Γ
corresponding to F under Theorem 3.1. Then it is clear that F is admissible if and only if D ⊂ f.l. Γ
holds. Therefore, for an artinian ring Γ, every exact structure on proj Γ is admissible.
We show that the admissibility is left-right symmetric under some assumptions.

Proposition 3.6. Let (proj Γ, F ) be an exact category for a noetherian ring Γ. Then it is admis-
sible if and only if (proj Γop, F op) is admissible.

Proof. Let D be the subcategory of mod Γ corresponding to F under Theorem 3.1. Then Ext2
Γ(D, Γ)
is the subcategory corresponding to F op. Since F is admissible, every object in D has ﬁnite length
as a Γ-module. Thus D is an abelian category in which every object has ﬁnite length. Be-
cause Ext2
E (D, E) has ﬁnite length in the abelian category

Γ(D, Γ) is dual to D, every object in Ext2

Γ(D, Γ). Since Ext2

Using this notion, we can classify all admissible exact structures on proj Γ.

Theorem 3.7. Let Γ be a noetherian ring. For E := proj Γ, there exists a bijection between the
following two classes.

(1) Admissible exact structures F on E.
(2) Sets S of isomorphism classes of simple Γ-modules satisfying the 2-regular condition.

The correspondence is given as follows.

• For a given F , a simple Γ-module S is in S if and only if there exists a deﬂation g : Y → Z

Proof. By Theorem 3.1, there exists a bijection between (1) and

(3) Subcategories D of C2(Γ) satisfying the following condition.
(a) D is a Serre subcategory of mod Γ satisfying D ⊂ f.l. Γ.
(b) Ext2
Γ(D, Γ) is a Serre subcategory of mod Γop.

We have mutually inverse bijections between (2) and (3) as follows; For a given S in (2), we
put D := Filt S, and for a given D in (3), we denote by S the set of simple modules contained
in D. By Lemma 3.2, these maps are well-deﬁned. These are mutually inverse to each other by
(cid:3)
deﬁnition.

Next we will focus on the case over the ground ring R. In the rest of this subsection, we ﬁx a
commutative noetherian complete local ring R. For an additive R-category E for a commutative
noetherian ring R, we say that E is Hom-noetherian (resp. Hom-ﬁnite) if the R-module E(X, Y )
is ﬁnitely generated (resp. of ﬁnite length) for every X, Y ∈ E. Every Hom-noetherian idempotent
complete R-category is Krull-Schmidt. For an exact R-category E, we say that E is Ext-noetherian
(resp. Ext-ﬁnite) if for every object X and Y , the R-module Ext1
E (X, Y ) is ﬁnitely generated (resp.
of ﬁnite length).

The following ﬁgure illustrates the relationship between these concepts. We will prove these
implication in Proposition 3.8 and Corollary 3.15. We refer the reader to Appendix A.2 for the
results and notions we need in the proof.

Figure 2. Some implications on admissibility

Proposition 3.8. Let E be a Hom-noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category. Then the
following hold.

(1) If E has either enough projectives or enough injectives, then E is Ext-noetherian.
(2) If E is Ext-noetherian and E is of ﬁnite type, then E is Ext-ﬁnite.
(3) If E is Ext-ﬁnite and E is of ﬁnite type, then E is admissible. Conversely, if E is admissible

and has enough injectives, then E is Ext-ﬁnite.

Proof. (1) This is clear since extension groups can be computed by projective resolutions or injec-
tive coresolutions.

(2) If E is of ﬁnite type, then E has AR conﬂations by Corollary A.4. Since E is Ext-noetherian,

Proposition A.5 implies that E is Ext-ﬁnite.

(3) Suppose that E is Ext-ﬁnite and of ﬁnite type. Take W to be an additive generator of E

and Γ := EndE W . For any conﬂation X

E is admissible.

Next we interpret Theorem 3.7 in terms of the quiver of Γ. Recall that for a noetherian R-

algebra Γ, the valued quiver Q(Γ) is deﬁned as follows, where J denotes the radical of proj Γ.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES

15

(1) The set of vertices is ind(proj Γ), that is, the isomorphism classes of all indecomposable

projective right Γ-modules.

(2) We draw an arrow from P to Q if J (P, Q)/J 2(P, Q) 6= 0 with a valuation (dP,Q, d′

P,Q),
where dP,Q (resp. d′
P,Q) is the dimension of J (P, Q)/J 2(P, Q) as a kP -vector space (resp.
kQ-vector space). Here kP := EndE (P )/ rad EndE (P ) and kQ := EndE (Q)/ rad EndE (Q).

We introduce a translation on this quiver Q(Γ).

Deﬁnition 3.9. Let Γ be a noetherian R-algebra. The translation τ of P ∈ Q(Γ) is deﬁned when
P/ rad P satisﬁes the 2-regular condition. In this case, τ P is the projective module Q such that
HomΓ(Q, Γ) is a projective cover of the simple left Γ-module Ext2
Γ(P/ rad P, Γ). We draw a dotted
arrow from P to τ P whenever τ P is deﬁned.

This construction yields a valued translation quiver (see [ARS]). Since we will not use valued

arrows, we omit the proof.

Now admissible exact structures on proj Γ can be visually classiﬁed by the dotted arrows.

Corollary 3.10. Let Γ be a noetherian R-algebra over a noetherian complete local ring R. Then
there exists a bijection between the following two classes.

(1) Admissible exact structures on proj Γ.
(2) Sets of dotted arrows in Q(Γ).

Moreover, the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the exact category E is given by the quiver Q(Γ) with
the dotted arrows chosen in (2).
Proof. Note that each dotted arrow τ P L99 P in Q(Γ) bijectively corresponds to the simple Γ-
module P/ rad P satisfying the 2-regular condition by the deﬁnition. Thus Theorem 3.7 implies
(cid:3)
the assertion.

In the situation of Corollary 3.10, let X be a set of dotted arrows in Q(Γ) and F be the
corresponding exact structures on E := proj Γ. For the convenience of the reader, we give several
relations between X and F .

• X is empty if and only if F is the split exact structure on E, that is, the smallest exact
structure in which only split exact sequences are conﬂations. This is nothing but the
“usual” exact structure on proj Γ, which is induced from the embedding proj Γ ⊂ mod Γ.
• X is the set of all dotted arrows if and only if F is the unique maximal exact structures
among admissible ones on E. In particular, if R is artinian, then this holds precisely when
F is the unique maximal exact structure, because all the exact structures are admissible
(see Figure 2).

• Let W be an indecomposable object in E. Then W is a projective (resp. injective) object
in (E, F ) if and only if W is not the source (resp. not the target) of a dotted arrow in X.
This follows from the description of projective objects given in the proof of Proposition
3.14(1) below.

We end this subsection by giving examples of Corollary 3.10.

Example 3.11. Let Γ be the algebra deﬁned in Example 1.2 the introduction. Then Q(Γ)
coincides with Figure 1 (all valuations are trivial, i.e. (1, 1) and all dotted lines are interpreted as
arrows from right to left). It has seven dotted arrows, thus proj Γ has 27 = 128 exact structures.
Actually, this example is due to [En, Example 5.7], and in that paper it is shown that the category
proj Γ is a strict τ -category, introduced by Iyama (see e.g. [Iy2]). For such a class of categories, we
have a nice correspondence between translation quivers and their mesh algebras: the quiver Q(Γ)
of the mesh algebra Γ coincides with the original translation quiver.

The following two examples concern with the category CM Λ of Cohen-Macaulay Λ-modules
over an order Λ. We refer the reader to Section 4 for the details on orders. The usual exact
structure on the category CM Λ is admissible if CM Λ is of ﬁnite type, since CM Λ has enough
projectives (Proposition 3.8). Therefore, the usual exact structure on CM Λ corresponds to the
set of dotted arrows of the usual Auslander-Reiten quiver of CM Λ.

Note that Γ is the Auslander order for an R-order

hence there is an equivalence proj Γ ≃ CM Λ, and the above translation quiver gives the Auslander-
Reiten quiver of CM Λ. Corollary 3.10 shows that proj Γ has 2n−1 admissible exact structures, and
the usual exact structure on CM Λ corresponds to the set of all dotted arrows. In general, for an
Cohen-Macaulay-ﬁnite R-order Λ over a complete discrete valuation ring R, the quiver Q(Γ) of
its Auslander order Γ coincides with the usual Auslander-Reiten quiver of CM Λ.

Here the double arrows are interpreted as the single arrows with valuation (2, 2). Note that
add(TR) = CM R holds, thus proj Γ ≃ CM R (see [Yo, Chapter 10] for the detail). Therefore
Corollary 3.10 implies that CM R has 2n admissible exact structures. The usual exact structure
on CM R corresponds to the set of all but one arrows above, which is the usual Auslander-Reiten
quiver of CM R. On the other hand, the exact structure on proj Γ corresponding to all dotted arrows
arises from the embedding proj Γ → mod Γ ։ mod Γ/ f.l. Γ, where mod Γ/ f.l. Γ is the localization
of mod Γ by the Serre subcategory f.l. Γ (we omit the details here).

3.3. Enough projectivity and admissibility. We collect some properties about the relation
between enough projectivity and admissibility of exact R-categories. Throughout this subsection,
we ﬁx a commutative noetherian complete local ring R.

By Proposition 3.8(3), If E is a Hom-noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category of ﬁnite
type which has enough projectives, then E is admissible. The following gives a criterion when the
converse holds.

Proposition 3.14. Let E := (proj Γ, F ) be an admissible exact category for a semiperfect noether-
ian ring Γ. Take an idempotent e ∈ Γ such that eΓ is an additive generator of projective objects
in E. Then the following hold.

(1) D = f.l.(Γ/ΓeΓ) holds, where D is the subcategory of mod Γ corresponding to F under

Theorem 3.1.

(2) E has enough projectives if and only if Γ/ΓeΓ is in f.l. Γ.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES

Proof. (1) Since Γ is semiperfect, E is a Krull-Schmidt exact category. By Proposition 2.11, an
object P in E is projective if and only if HomΓ(P, D) = 0. Thus an indecomposable object in E is
projective in E if and only if it is the projective cover of a simple Γ-module which is not contained
in D. Therefore, a simple Γ-module S is contained in D if and only if HomE (eΓ, S) = 0, that is,
Se = 0. Thus, for a Γ-module M ∈ mod Γ, it follows that M ∈ D holds if and only if M e = 0 and
M ∈ f.l. Γ, which implies the assertion.

(2) Recall that a morphism g : P → X in E is a deﬂation if and only if Coker(g) in mod Γ
is in D, and every projective resolution of M ∈ D yields a conﬂation in E. Thus E has enough
projectives if and only if there exists an exact sequence

g
−→ Γ → M → 0

P

(3.1)

in mod Γ for some objects P ∈ add(eΓ) and M ∈ D. Suppose that this holds. Then Im(g) ⊂ ΓeΓ
holds, so we have a surjection M ։ Γ/ΓeΓ. Since M is in D, it follows that M is of ﬁnite length,
thus so is Γ/ΓeΓ. Conversely, suppose that Γ/ΓeΓ has ﬁnite length. Then Γ/ΓeΓ is contained in
D = f.l.(Γ/ΓeΓ). Since Γ is noetherian, ΓeΓ is a ﬁnitely generated as a right Γ-module. Therefore
(cid:3)
there exists an exact sequence of the form (3.1) with M = Γ/ΓeΓ.

Consequently, we have the following interesting consequences.

It is remarkable that we use

purely module-theoretical argument to show non-trivial properties of exact categories.

Corollary 3.15. Let E be a Hom-noetherian idempotent complete admissible exact R-category of
ﬁnite type. Then the following holds.

(1) If R is artinian, then E has enough projectives and injectives.
(2) E has enough projectives if and only if E has enough injectives.

Proof. (1) Immediate from Proposition 3.14(2).

(2) It suﬃces to show the “only if” part. We may assume E = (proj Γ, F ) for a noetherian
R-algebra Γ. Denote by D = Filt S the Serre subcategory of mod Γ which corresponds to F under
Theorem 3.7, and take idempotents e and f in Γ such that eΓ (resp. f Γ) is an additive generator
of projective objects (resp. injective objects) in E. Put Γ := Γ/ΓeΓ and Γ := Γ/Γf Γ. We know
from Proposition 3.14(2) that Γ is of ﬁnite length, and it suﬃces to show that Γ is of ﬁnite length.

Since the kernel of Γ/ radi Γ ։ Γ/ radi−1 Γ is contained in rad Γ/ radi Γ, it follows that fi is
(cid:3)
surjective for each i, which contradicts the fact that P k has ﬁnite length.

Remark 3.16. If R is not artinian, E does not necessarily has enough projectives. For example,
consider Example 3.13. Then proj Γ has the exact structure corresponding to all the dotted arrows.
In this exact structure, there exists no non-zero projective object.

3.4. AR conﬂations and the Grothendieck group. In this subsection, we investigate the
Grothendieck group of exact categories. Several papers showed that the relation of the Grothendieck
group K0(E) is generated by AR sequences when E is a particular exact category of ﬁnite type,
e.g. [AR2, But, Yo]. Our aim in this subsection is to unify these results.

Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category. First we recall the following basic concepts in the AR
theory. A morphism g : Y → Z in E is called right almost split if g is not a retraction and any
non-retraction h : W → Z factors through g. Dually we deﬁne left almost split. We say that a

18

H. ENOMOTO

f
−→ Y

g
conﬂation X
−→ Z in E is an AR conﬂation if f is left almost split and g is right almost
split. We say that E has AR conﬂations if for every indecomposable non-projective object Z there
exists an AR conﬂation ending at Z, and for every indecomposable non-injective object X there
exists an AR conﬂation starting at X. For further properties of AR conﬂations, we refer the
reader to Appendix A.1. In Corollary A.4, we will prove that Krull-Schmidt exact category E has
AR conﬂations if E is of ﬁnite type and the endomorphism ring of an additive generator of E is
noetherian.

Next we introduce some notation concerning the Grothendieck group. For a Krull-Schmidt
Z · [X] generated by the set ind E
exact category E, let G(E) be the free abelian group
of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in E. We denote by Ex(E) the subgroup of G(E)
generated by

[X]∈ind E

L

{[X] − [Y ] + [Z] | there exists a conﬂation X ֌ Y ։ Z in E}.

We call the quotient group K0(E) := G(E)/ Ex(E) the Grothendieck group of E. We denote by
AR(E) the subgroup of Ex(E) generated by

{[X] − [Y ] + [Z] | there exists an AR conﬂation X ֌ Y ։ Z in E}.

Now we prove the main result about the relation of the Grothendieck groups.

Theorem 3.17. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt exact category of ﬁnite type such that the endomorphism
ring of an additive generator of E is noetherian. If the exact structure on E is admissible, then
Ex(E) = AR(E) holds.

Proof. Since AR(E) ⊂ Ex(E) always holds, we will check Ex(E) ⊂ AR(E). Let Γ be the endomor-
phism ring of an additive generator of E. Then E ≃ proj Γ holds, so we may assume that E = proj Γ
for a semiperfect noetherian ring Γ. Denote by S the set of simple Γ-modules corresponding to
the exact structure on E = proj Γ under Theorem 3.7.

Let X1

f1
−→ Y1

g1
−→ Z1 be a conﬂation in E and M := Coker(g1) in mod Γ. Then M is in Filt S by
Theorem 3.7. We show [X1] − [Y1] + [Z1] ∈ AR(E). Suppose that there exists another conﬂation
g2
−→ Z2 in E such that M ∼= Coker(g2). Then we have the exact sequences
X2

f2

in mod Γ for each i = 1, 2. Thus Schanuel’s lemma shows that X1 ⊕ Y2 ⊕ Z1 ∼= X2 ⊕ Y1 ⊕ Z2, which
implies that [X1] − [Y1] + [Z1] = [X2] − [Y2] + [Z2] in G(E). Thus it suﬃces to show the following
claim to prove our theorem.

Claim: For any M ∈ Filt S, there exists at least one exact sequence in mod Γ

with X, Y, Z ∈ proj Γ and [X] − [Y ] + [Z] ∈ AR(E).

We will show this claim by induction on l(M ), the length of M as a Γ-module. Suppose that

0 → X → Y → Z → M → 0

l(M ) = 1, that is, M ∈ S. Take the minimal projective resolution 0 → X
of M with X, Y, Z ∈ proj Γ = E. By the proof of Proposition A.3, we have that X
indeed an AR-conﬂation in E. Thus [X] − [Y ] + [Z] ∈ AR(E).

Now suppose that l(M ) > 1. Take a simple Γ-module M1 ∈ S which is a submodule of M .
Then we have an exact sequence 0 → M1 → M → M2 → 0, where M1 and M2 are in Filt S. Since
gi−→ Zi →
l(M1), l(M2) < l(M ), we have the corresponding projective resolutions 0 → Xi

Corollary 3.18. Let R be a noetherian complete local ring and E a Hom-noetherian idempotent
complete exact R-category of ﬁnite type. Suppose either R is artinian or E has enough projectives.
Then Ex(E) = AR(E) holds.

Proof. In both cases, E is an admissible exact category by Proposition 3.8. Thus Theorem 3.17
(cid:3)

4. Classifications of CM-finite algebras

In this section, we apply our previous results to the representation theory of Iwanaga-Gorenstein
algebras and orders. More generally, we study the left perpendicular category ⊥U for a cotilting
module U . Throughout this section, we ﬁx a commutative noetherian complete local ring R.

4.1. Cotilting modules. First, we introduce the notion of cotilting module following [AR3]. Let
Λ be a noetherian ring and U ∈ mod Λ a Λ-module. We denote by ⊥U the subcategory of
mod Λ consisting of all modules X satisfying Ext>0
Λ (X, U ) = 0. Since ⊥U is an extension-closed
subcategory of mod Λ, we always regard ⊥U as an exact category.

Deﬁnition 4.1. We say that U is a cotilting module if it satisﬁes the following conditions.

Λ (U, U ) = 0.

(C1) id UΛ is ﬁnite.
(C2) Ext>0
(C3) ⊥U has enough injectives add U , that is, for every X in ⊥U , there exists an exact sequence
0 → X → U 0 → Y → 0

in mod Λ with Y ∈ ⊥U and U 0 ∈ add U .

We shall see in Proposition 4.4 that if we restrict to R-orders, then our deﬁnition of cotilting
modules coincides with the usual one, e.g. in [Iy3]. From our deﬁnition, the following property is
immediate. Here we say that an object X in an exact category E is a projective generator (resp.
injective cogenerator ) if E has enough projectives add X (resp. enough injectives add X).

Proposition 4.2. Let Λ be a noetherian ring and U ∈ mod Λ a cotilting Λ-module. Then ⊥U is
an exact category with a projective generator Λ and an injective cogenerator U .

Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring admitting a canonical module ω, for example, complete
Cohen-Macaulay local ring. For a noetherian R-algebra Λ, we denote by CM Λ the subcategory
of mod Λ consisting of modules which are maximal Cohen-Macaulay as R-modules. A noetherian
R-algebra Λ is called an R-order if Λ ∈ CM Λ holds. For an R-order Λ, there exists a duality Dd :=
HomR(−, ω) : CM Λ ≃ CM Λop. It is immediate that CM Λ is an extension-closed subcategory of
mod Λ with a projective generator Λ and an injective cogenerator DdΛ.

We prepare the following well-known properties of R-orders.

Lemma 4.3. Let R be a d-dimensional complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring, Λ an R-order and
M ∈ CM Λ. Then the following holds.

(1) CM Λ = ⊥(DdΛ) holds, and id(DdΛ)Λ = d.
(2) id MΛ ≥ d holds, and id MΛ ≤ m if and only if Ext>m−d

Λ

(X, M ) = 0 for all X ∈ CM Λ.

Proof. Both follow from [GN1, Proposition 1.1].

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.4. Let R be a d-dimensional complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring, Λ a noetherian
R-algebra and U a ﬁnitely generated Λ-module.

(1) Suppose that Λ is an R-order and U ∈ CM Λ. Then U is a cotilting module if and only if

U satisﬁes the condition (C1), (C2) in Deﬁnition 4.1 and the following.

(C3′) There exists an exact sequence

0 → Un → · · · → U1 → U0 → DdΛ → 0

in mod Λ for some n such that Ui ∈ add U for each i.

In particular, U is a cotilting module with id UΛ ≤ d if and only if add U = add DdΛ.

20

H. ENOMOTO

(2) Suppose that U is a cotilting Λ-module. Then ⊥U ⊂ CM Λ holds if and only if Λ is an

R-order and U ∈ CM Λ holds.

Proof. (1) Suppose that U satisﬁes (C1), (C2) and (C3′). Then the same proof as in [AR3,
Theorem 5.4] implies that (C3) holds (see [Iy3, Proposition 3.2.2] for the order case).

Conversely, suppose that U ∈ CM Λ satisﬁes (C1)-(C3). First we show ⊥U ⊂ CM Λ. Let X be
in ⊥U . Then by (C3), we have an exact sequence 0 → X → U 0 → U 1 → · · · → U d−1 with U i in
add U for each i. Since each U i is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module, it follows from the
depth lemma [BH, Proposition 1.2.9] that X is in CM Λ.

Next we will see that (C3′) holds. Put X := ⊥U and denote by

U the subcategory of mod Λ

consisting of modules Y such that there exists an exact sequence

b

0 → Un → · · · → U1 → U0 → Y → 0
in mod Λ for some n with Ui ∈ add U for each i. Then the Auslander-Buchweitz theory implies
that Y ∈
Λ (X , Y ) = 0 (see [AB, Proposition 3.6] or [En, Corollary A.3] for the detail).
Since X ⊂ CM Λ and Ext>0

Λ (CM Λ, DdΛ) = 0, we obtain DdΛ ∈

U , which implies (C3′).

U if Ext>0

It follows from Lemma 4.3(2) that id UΛ ≤ d if and only if U is an injective object in CM Λ.

b

Thus the remaining assertion easily follows from the deﬁnition and (C3′).

(2) If we have ⊥U ⊂ CM Λ, then in particular Λ and U are in CM Λ, which in particular implies
that Λ is an R-order. Thus the “only if” part follows. The the “if” part has already shown in the
(cid:3)
proof of (1).

b

A noetherian ring Λ is called Iwanaga-Gorenstein if both id(ΛΛ) and id(ΛΛ) are ﬁnite. By [Za,
Lemma A], we have id(ΛΛ) = id(ΛΛ) in this case. For an Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring Λ, a Λ-module
X ∈ mod Λ is called Gorenstein-projective if X is in GP Λ := ⊥Λ. Then GP Λ is a Frobenius exact
category with a projective generator Λ. An Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring Λ is GP-ﬁnite if GP Λ is
of ﬁnite type. These concepts are special cases of cotilting modules, as the following proposition
shows. If Λ is an R-order, then this can be easily proved by using Proposition 4.4.

Proposition 4.5. Let Λ be a noetherian ring.

(1) Λ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein if and only if ΛΛ is a cotilting Λ-module.
(2) Let U ∈ mod Λ be a cotilting Λ-module. Then ⊥U is Frobenius if and only if Λ is Iwanaga-

Gorenstein and add U = proj Λ holds.

Proof. (1) First we show the “only if” part. Suppose that Λ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein. Then ΛΛ
clearly satisﬁes (C1) and (C2). Moreover (C3) follows from the fact that ⊥Λ = GP Λ is the
Frobenius category with an injective cogenerator Λ.

To show the “if” part, we use the main result of [HH]. We refer the reader to [HH] and references
therein for the unexplained concepts. In [HH], it was shown that Λ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein if every
module in mod Λ has a ﬁnite Gorenstein-projective dimension. Thus it suﬃces to see that this is
the case if ΛΛ is cotilting, which follows from [En, Proposition 4.2].

(2) Clear from (1) and Proposition 4.2.

(cid:3)

In the paper [En], it was characterized when a given exact category is exact equivalent to the
exact category of the form ⊥U for a cotilting module U over a noetherian ring. For an integer
n ≥ 1, we say that E has n-kernels if for every morphism f : X → Y in E, there exists a complex

fn−→ · · ·
in E such that the following diagram is exact.

Proposition 4.6 ([En, Corollary 4.12]). Suppose that E := (proj Γ, F ) is an exact category for a
noetherian ring Γ and n ≥ 2 is an integer.
(1) The following are equivalent.

(a) There exist a noetherian ring Λ and a cotilting Λ-module U with id UΛ ≤ n such that

⊥U is exact equivalent to E.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES

21

(b) E has projective generators and injective cogenerators, and gl.dim Γ ≤ n holds.
(c) E has projective generators, injective cogenerators, and (n − 1)-kernels.

(2) Suppose that the condition in (1) holds. Take a projective generator P and an injective
cogenerator I, and put Λ := EndE (P ) and U := E(P, I) ∈ mod Λ. Then Λ and U satisﬁes
(1) and E(P, −) gives an exact equivalence E ≃ ⊥U .

Proof. Note that the endomorphism ring of every object in E is noetherian, see e.g. [Sa, Proposition
(cid:3)
2.3]. Thus [En, Theorem 4.11] applies.

4.2. Classiﬁcations for noetherian R-algebras. To state our classiﬁcations, it is convenient
to introduce the following terminology.

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let R be a noetherian complete local ring.

(1) We say that a pair (Λ, U ) is an n-cotilting pair if Λ is a noetherian R-algebra and U ∈
mod Λ is a cotilting Λ-module with id UΛ ≤ n. Cotilting pairs (Λ1, U1) and (Λ2, U2) are
said to be equivalent if there exists an equivalence mod Λ1 → mod Λ2 which induces an
equivalence add U1 → add U2.

(2) We say that a pair (Γ, X) is an algebra with dotted arrows if Γ is a noetherian R-algebra
and X is a set of dotted arrows of Q(Γ) (see Deﬁnition 3.9). Two such pairs (Γ1, X1) and
(Γ2, X2) are said to be equivalent if there exists an equivalence proj Γ1 → proj Γ2 such that
X1 corresponds to X2 under the isomorphism Q(Γ1) → Q(Γ2). For an algebra with dotted
arrows (Γ, X), let PX be the direct sum of indecomposable projective Γ-modules which are
not sources of dotted arrows in X. We ﬁx an idempotent eX ∈ Γ satisfying eXΓ = PX.

The following main theorem classiﬁes an n-cotilting pair of ﬁnite type by algebras with ﬁnite

global dimension and set of dotted arrows.

Theorem 4.8. Let R be a noetherian complete local ring. There exists a bijection between the
following for n ≥ 2.

(1) Equivalence classes of n-cotilting pairs (Λ, U ) such that ⊥U is of ﬁnite type.
(2) Equivalence classes of algebras with dotted arrows (Γ, X) such that gl.dim Γ ≤ n and

Γ/ΓeXΓ is of ﬁnite length over R.

(3) Exact equivalence classes of Hom-noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category E of
ﬁnite type such that E has enough projectives, enough injectives and (n − 1)-kernels.

Proof. By Corollary 3.10, we have the bijection between (2) and the following.

(4) Exact equivalence classes of (proj Γ, F ), where Γ is a noetherian R-algebra with gl.dim Γ ≤

n and F is an exact structure on proj Γ with enough projectives and injectives.

In fact, Proposition 3.8 shows that F in (4) is admissible, and Proposition 3.14 and Corollary 3.15
implies that F has enough projectives and injectives if and only if Γ/ΓeXΓ is of ﬁnite length.

By Proposition 4.6, we have the bijections between (2), (3) and (4). Finally, we have maps
between (1) and (3) as follows. For an n-cotilting pair (Λ, U ) in (1), we put E := ⊥U . For an
exact category E in (3), there exists an n-cotilting pair (Λ, U ) such that ⊥U is exact equivalent
to E by Proposition 4.6, which satisﬁes the condition of (1). The straightforward argument shows
(cid:3)
that these maps are mutually inverse to each other.

Next we shall apply Theorem 4.8 to GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras. For a translation
quiver Q, we consider a τ -orbit (that is, a connected component of the graph Q′ consisting of the
same vertices as Q and all the dotted translation arrows of Q). We say that a τ -orbit is stable if
every vertex on it is both a source and a target of dotted arrows.

Corollary 4.9. Let R be a noetherian complete local ring. There exists a bijection between the
following for n ≥ 2.

(1) Morita equivalence classes of GP-ﬁnite Iwanaga-Gorenstein noetherian R-algebras Λ with

id Λ ≤ n.

(2) Equivalence classes of algebras with dotted arrows (Γ, X) satisfying the following.

(a) gl.dim Γ ≤ n.

22

H. ENOMOTO

(b) Γ/ΓeXΓ is of ﬁnite length over R.
(c) X is a union of stable τ -orbits in Q(Γ).

Proof. By Proposition 4.5, it suﬃces to show that the pair (Γ, F ) in Theorem 4.8(2) gives the
Frobenius exact structure on proj Γ if and only if X in Theorem 4.8(2) is a union of stable τ -orbits.
Since the exact category proj Γ has enough projectives and injectives by Proposition 3.14(2) and
Corollary 3.15, the exact structure F is Frobenius if and only if the class of projectives and that
of injectives coincide. For a set of dotted arrows X, an indecomposable object M in proj Γ is not
projective (resp. not injective) in F if and only if there exists a dotted arrow in X starting at
(resp. ending at) M . Therefore the class of indecomposable non-projective objects and that of
indecomposable non-injective objects coincide if and only if X is a union of some stable τ -orbits,
(cid:3)
which clearly implies the assertion.

We refer the reader to Example 1.2 in Section 1 for the detailed example of this classiﬁcation.

4.3. Classiﬁcations for R-orders. Restricting Theorem 4.8 to the case of R-orders, we obtain
the corresponding result as follows.

Corollary 4.10. Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring. Then there exists a bijection
between the following for n ≥ 2.

(1) Equivalence classes of n-cotilting pairs (Λ, U ) such that Λ is an R-order, U is in CM Λ

and ⊥U is of ﬁnite type.

(2) Equivalence classes of algebras with dotted arrows (Γ, X) satisfying the following.

(a) gl.dim Γ ≤ n.
(b) Γ/ΓeXΓ is of ﬁnite length over R.
(c) ΓeX is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module.

Proof. We check that the bijections in Theorem 4.8 restricts to this case. By Proposition 4.4(2),
we may replace the equivalence class (1) with

(1′) Equivalence classes of n-cotilting pairs (Λ, U ) such that ⊥U is of ﬁnite type and ⊥U ⊂ CM Λ

holds.

Suppose that (Λ, U ) and (Γ, X) correspond to each other under Theorem 4.8.

It suﬃces to
show that ⊥U ⊂ CM Λ if and only if ΓeX is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module. Notice
that add eXΓ is the category of all projective objects in the exact category (proj Γ, F ), thus eXΓ
is a projective generator of it. Hence we may assume that Λ = EndΓ(eXΓ) = eXΓeX.
In this
situation, we have an embedding HomΓ(eXΓ, −) : proj Γ → mod Λ whose essential image is ⊥U . It
follows that ⊥U = add HomΓ(eXΓ, Γ) = add ΓeX. Therefore ΓeX is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as
(cid:3)
an R-module if and only if ⊥U ⊂ CM Λ holds.

This gives the following Auslander-type correspondence for Cohen-Macaulay-ﬁnite R-orders
with dim R ≥ 2. It largely improves [Iy3, Theorem 4.2.3] for the case n = 1, because our result
gives a bijection for Cohen-Macaulay-ﬁnite orders and some assumptions on Γ in [Iy3, Theorem
4.2.3] are dropped.

Corollary 4.11. Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring with dim R = d ≥ 2. Then there
exists a bijection between the following.

(1) Morita equivalence classes of R-orders Λ such that CM Λ is of ﬁnite type.
(2) Equivalence classes of algebras with dotted arrows (Γ, X) satisfying the following.

(a) gl.dim Γ = d.
(b) Γ/ΓeXΓ is of ﬁnite length over R.
(c) ΓeX is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module.

Proof. Let us apply Corollary 4.10 to the case n = d. By Proposition 4.4, it suﬃces to show
that for a noetherian R-algebra Γ satisfying the conditions of (2)(c), we have gl.dim Γ ≥ d. Every
noetherian R-algebra Γ satisﬁes dimR Γ ≤ gl.dim Γ , see e.g. [GN2, Corollary 3.5(4)]. Since ΓeX is
a direct summand of Γ and ΓeX is maximal Cohen-Macaulay, we have d = dimR ΓeX ≤ dimR Γ ≤
(cid:3)
gl.dim Γ.

Appendix A. The AR theory for exact categories over a noetherian ring

In this appendix, we study the Auslander-Reiten theory for exact categories over a noetherian
complete local ring. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the existence of AR
conﬂations, the AR duality and the notion of dualizing R-varieties.

A.1. Existence of AR conﬂations. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category. We denote by J the
Jacobson radical of E. We need later the following easy lemma about kernel-cokernel pairs in
Krull-Schmidt categories.

Lemma A.1. Suppose that X → Y → Z is a kernel-cokernel pair in E. Then this complex is
isomorphic to the direct sum of kernel-cokernel pairs of the following forms.

(1) A = A → 0 for some A in E.
(2) 0 → B = B for some B in E.
(3) X ′ → Y ′ → Z ′ with all morphisms in J .

Let E be a Krull-Schmidt exact category. Recall that a conﬂation X

g
−→ Z in E is an
AR conﬂation if f is left almost split and g is right almost split. It immediately follows from the

f
−→ Y

g
deﬁnition that if X
−→ Z is an AR conﬂation, then f is left minimal, that is, any ϕ : Y → Y
satisfying ϕf = f is an automorphism. Dually g is right minimal in this case. Also one can prove
the uniqueness of the AR conﬂation as in the classical case.

f
−→ Y

The following classical observation is useful for us. For an object X in E, we put SX :=

PX /J (−, X) ∈ Mod E and SX := P X /J (X, −) ∈ Mod E op.

Proposition A.2. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category. Then the following hold.

(1) The map X 7→ SX gives a bijection between ind E and the set of isomorphism classes of

simple object in Mod E.

(2) A morphism Y

g
−→ Z is right almost split if and only if Z is indecomposable and PY

Pg−−→

PZ → SZ → 0 is exact.

(3) There exists a right almost split morphism ending at Z if and only if SZ is ﬁnitely pre-

sented.

Proof. It is well-known, see [Au3] for example.

(cid:3)

The following proposition says that the existence of the right almost split map ensures the

existence of the AR conﬂation.

Proposition A.3. Let Z be an indecomposable non-projective object in E. Then the following are
equivalent.

(1) There exists a right almost split morphism to Z.
(2) There exists an AR conﬂation X ֌ Y ։ Z in E ending at Z.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Since Z is not projective, there exists some object M in D such that M (Z) 6= 0
by Proposition 2.11. This means that there exists some non-zero morphism a : PZ → M by the
Yoneda lemma. Since Im a is ﬁnitely generated and D is a Serre subcategory of mod E, we have
that Im a is also in D. Since PZ has a unique maximal subobject J (−, Z), it is easy to see that the
cokernel of the composition J (−, Z) → PZ → Im a is isomorphic to SZ. Since J (−, Z) is ﬁnitely
g
−→ Z such that g is
generated by (1), we have SZ ∈ D. Therefore, we obtain a conﬂation X
right almost split. Now we may assume that f is in J by Lemma A.1. This clearly implies that
g is right minimal and the classical argument shows that f is left almost split.

f
−→ Y

(2) ⇒ (1): Obvious from the deﬁnition.

(cid:3)

We say that E has AR conﬂations if for every indecomposable non-projective object Z there
exists an AR conﬂation ending at Z, and for every indecomposable non-injective object X there
exists an AR conﬂation starting at X.

Corollary A.4. Suppose that E := proj Λ is an exact category for a semiperfect noetherian ring
Λ. Then E has AR conﬂations.

24

H. ENOMOTO

Proof. We have Mod E ≃ Mod Λ, so every simple object in this category is ﬁnitely presented
(cid:3)
because Λ is noetherian. Thus the assertion holds by Propositions A.2 and A.3.

A.2. AR conﬂations, the AR duality and dualizing varieties. Next we investigate the
relationship between AR conﬂations and the AR duality in the general setting. In what follows,
we denote by R a commutative noetherian complete local ring.

We denote by I the injective envelope of the simple R-module R/ rad R, and by D : Mod R →
Mod R the Matlis dual D = HomR(−, I).
It is well-known that this induces a duality D :
noeth R ↔ art R and D : f.l. R ↔ f.l. R, where noeth R, art R and f.l. R denotes the subcategory of
Mod R consisting of R-modules which are noetherian, artinian and of ﬁnite length respectively.

E (Z, X) → Ext1

From now on, we assume that E is a Hom-noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category.
Recall that a morphism f : W → Z in E is projectively trivial if for each object X, the induced
map Ext1
E (W, X) is zero. It is easy to see that f is projectively trivial if and only
if f factors through every deﬂation Y ։ Z. If E has enough projectives, then f is projectively
trivial if and only if f factors through some projective object. Denote by P(X, Y ) the set of
all projectively trivial morphisms from X to Y . Then P is a two-sided ideal of E and we put
E := E/P, which we call the projectively stable category. Dually we deﬁne the notion of injectively
trivial morphisms and the injectively stable category E := E/I.

The following theorem is an exact category version of [RVdB1, Proposition I.2.3], and it gener-
alizes [LNP, Theorem 3.6] and [Ji, Proposition 2.4]. Also see [LNP, INP] for related work. Note
that we do not assume that R is artinian or E is Hom-ﬁnite. This enables us to give another proof
of the one implication of Auslander’s theorem about isolated singularities, see Remark A.10

Proposition A.5. Suppose that E is Hom-noetherian Krull-Schmidt exact R-category such that
either (i) E is Ext-noetherian or (ii) E is Hom-ﬁnite. Let Z be an indecomposable non-projective
object in E. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) There exists a right almost split morphism to Z.
(2) There exists an AR conﬂation X ֌ Y ։ Z ending at Z.
(3) The functor D Ext1
E(Z, −) : E → Mod R is representable.

Moreover, if X ֌ Y ։ Z is an AR conﬂation, then D Ext1
Ext1

E(Z, W ) and E(W, X) are of ﬁnite length over R for every W ∈ E.

E (Z, −) ≃ E(−, X) holds, and thus

Proof. (1) ⇔ (2): This is Proposition A.3.

(2) ⇒ (3): Suppose that η : X ֌ Y ։ Z is an AR conﬂation. We regard 0 6= η ∈ Ext1

Since I is a cogenerator of Mod R, there exists a non-zero morphism γ : Ext1
such that γ(η) 6= 0. Then we have a morphism
h−, −iW : E(W, X) ⊗R Ext1

E(Z, W ) → I,

(h, µ) 7→ γ(hµ)

E (Z, X).
E (Z, X) → I in Mod R

in Mod R, where hµ is the image of µ by the induced morphism Ext1
E (Z, W ) →
Ext1
E(Z, X). Then the same proof as in [Ji, Lemma 2.1] applies here to show that h−, −iW is
non-degenerate in both variables. Therefore, we have two injections E(W, X) ֒→ D Ext1
E (Z, W )
and Ext1
E (Z, W ) ֒→ DE(W, X) in Mod R. They are obviously isomorphisms if (ii) E is Hom-ﬁnite.
Suppose that (i) E is Ext-noetherian. Then D Ext1
E (Z, W ) is artinian, thus E(W, X) is of ﬁnite
length. Therefore two injections are isomorphisms and both of E(W, X) and Ext1
E (Z, W ) are of
ﬁnite length over R. The naturality in W is clear from a direct calculation, so we obtain an
isomorphism of functors D Ext1

E (Z, f ) : Ext1

E (Z, −) ≃ E(−, X).

(3) ⇒ (2): The proof of [Ji, Lemma 2.2] applies here.

(cid:3)

In the rest of the appendix, we show that the existence of AR conﬂations are closely related to

the notion of dualizing R-varieties, introduced in [AR1] and [AR4].

Deﬁnition A.6. Let C be a Hom-ﬁnite idempotent complete R-category. We say that C is a
dualizing R-variety if it satisﬁes both of the following.

(1) For any ﬁnitely presented R-functor F : Cop → f.l. R, the composition functor DF : Cop →

f.l. R → f.l. R is ﬁnitely presented.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF EXACT STRUCTURES

25

(2) For any ﬁnitely presented R-functor G : C → f.l. R, the composition functor DF : C →

f.l. R → f.l. R is ﬁnitely presented.

The following properties are immediate, which we state without proofs.

Lemma A.7. Let C be a dualizing R-variety. Then the following hold.

(1) The category of ﬁnitely presented functors mod1 C and mod1 Cop are abelian categories.
(2) D induces a duality D : mod1 C ↔ mod1 Cop.

The following technical lemma is elementary.

Lemma A.8. Let E be an exact category with enough projectives and injectives. Then mod1 E is
an abelian category with enough projectives and injectives. The functor E → mod1 E deﬁned by
X 7→ E(−, X) gives the equivalence between E and the category of projective objects in mod1 E,
and the functor E → mod1 E deﬁned by X 7→ Ext1
E (−, X) gives the equivalence between E and the
category of injective objects in mod1 E.

Proof. To show that mod1 E is abelian, it suﬃces to show that E has weak kernels, see [Au1]. Let
g : Y → Z be any morphism in E. Since E has enough projectives, we have the following pullback
diagram with P being projective.

Z ′

Z ′

/ E a /
b(cid:15)
/ P

c

Y
g(cid:15)
/ Z

It is straightforward to check that a gives the weak kernel of g ∈ E(Y, Z).

The remaining assertion follows from the same argument as in [Iy3, Theorem 2.2.2(1)].

(A.1)

(cid:3)

Now we are in position to prove our main results in this appendix, which is an exact category

version of [AR4, Proposition 2.2].

Theorem A.9. Let E be a Hom-noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category with enough
projectives and injectives. The following are equivalent.

(1) The category E has AR conﬂations.
(2) E is a dualizing R-variety.
(3) E is a dualizing R-variety.
(4) There exist mutually inverse equivalences τ : E ⇄ E : τ − such that we have natural

isomorphisms DE(τ −X, Z) ∼= Ext1

E (Z, X) ∼= DE(X, τ Z).

In this case, E is Ext-ﬁnite and E and E are Hom-ﬁnite.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): First note that E is Hom-ﬁnite by Proposition A.5. Let F ∈ mod1 E be a ﬁnitely
presented functor. We have an exact sequence E(−, Y ) → E(−, Z) → F → 0 in Mod E, which is
induced from g : Y → Z in E by the Yoneda lemma. Consider the diagram (A.1). It is standard
t[b,−a]
−−−−→ P ⊕ Y

that the right square gives a conﬂation E

[c,g]
−−→ Z (see e.g.

[B¨u, Proposition

2.12]). Hence by replacing g by [c, g], we may assume that X

f
−→ Y

g
−→ Z is a conﬂation with

E(−, Y )

(−)◦g
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → F → 0 being exact.

By the long exact sequence of Ext,

E(−, Y )

(−)◦g
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → Ext1

E (−, X)

E (−,f )
Ext

E (−, Y )

Since D : Mod E → Mod E op is a contravariant exact functor, we obtain an exact sequence

E (−, X) are representable, which

Next suppose that G ∈ mod1 E op is a ﬁnitely presented functor. We have an exact sequence
E(B, −) → E(A, −) → G → 0 in Mod E op. Applying D, we obtain an exact sequence 0 → DG →
DE(A, −) → DE(B, −) in Mod E. We will show that DE(A, −) ≃ Ext1
E (−, τ A) for some τ A in E.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that A has no non-zero projective summands. Then
we have a direct sum of AR conﬂations τ A ֌ E ։ A in E. By Proposition A.5, DE(A, −) ≃
Ext1

E(−, τ A) holds. Thus we obtain the following exact sequence in Mod E.

0 → DG → Ext1

E (−, τ A) → Ext1

E (−, τ B)

Since E has weak kernels by Lemma A.8, the subcategory mod1 E is closed under kernels in Mod E
(see [Au1]). Also Lemma A.8 shows that Ext1
E (−, τ A) is ﬁnitely presented. Thus DG is also
ﬁnitely presented.

(2) ⇒ (4): Since E is a dualizing R-variety, we have a duality D : mod1 E op ≃ mod1 E between
abelian categories. It induces a duality D : P ≃ I, where P (resp. I) denotes the category of
injective objects in mod1 E op). By Lemma A.8, we have a
projective objects in mod1 E (resp.
equivalence I ≃ E and the contravariant Yoneda embedding E ≃ P. Deﬁne the equivalence τ by
the composition E ≃ P ≃ I ≃ E and denote by τ − its quasi-inverse. Then it follows from Lemma
A.8 that (4) holds.

(4) ⇒ (1): Obvious from Proposition A.5.
By duality, (3) is also equivalent to all the other conditions.

(cid:3)

This theorem gives an application about the relation between AR conﬂations and isolated
singularities shown in [Au4]. For a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring R, we say that an R-
order Λ has at most an isolated singularity if gl.dim Λ ⊗R Rp = ht p holds for every non-maximal
prime ideal p of R. It is well-known that an R-order Λ has at most an isolated singularity if and
only if CM Λ is Hom-ﬁnite.

Remark A.10. Suppose that CM Λ has AR conﬂations. Then CM Λ is a dualizing R-variety by
Theorem A.9, hence in particular CM Λ is Hom-ﬁnite, and therefore Λ has at most an isolated
singularity. This gives a simple conceptual proof of the “only if” part of the main theorem of
[Au4]; CM Λ has AR conﬂations if and only if Λ has at most an isolated singularity.
