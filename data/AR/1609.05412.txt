ABSTRACT
With the high-resolution data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, we detect a light wall
above a sunspot light bridge in the NOAA active region (AR) 12403. In the 1330 ˚A slit-jaw images,
the light wall is brighter than the ambient areas while the wall top and base are much brighter than
the wall body, and it keeps oscillating above the light bridge. A C8.0 ﬂare caused by a ﬁlament
activation occurred in this AR with the peak at 02:52 UT on 2015 August 28, and the ﬂare’s one
ribbon overlapped the light bridge which was the observational base of the light wall. Consequently, the
oscillation of the light wall was evidently disturbed. The mean projective oscillation amplitude of the
light wall increased from 0.5 Mm to 1.6 Mm before the ﬂare, and decreased to 0.6 Mm after the ﬂare.
We suggest that the light wall shares a group of magnetic ﬁeld lines with the ﬂare loops, which undergo
a magnetic reconnection process, and they constitute a coupled system. When the magnetic ﬁeld lines
are pushed upwards at the pre-ﬂare stage, the light wall turns to the vertical direction, resulting in
the increase of the light wall’s projective oscillation amplitude. After the magnetic reconnection takes
place, a group of new ﬁeld lines with smaller scales are formed underneath the reconnection site and
the light wall inclines. Thus, the projective amplitude decreases remarkably at the post-ﬂare stage.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are energetic phenomena in the solar atmosphere, releasing dramatic electromagnetic energy spanning the
range from X-ray to radio wavelengths. In the standard two-dimensional (2D) ﬂare model (CSHKP models; Carmichael
1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), a ﬁlament rises above the neutral line and then initially
drives the ﬂare process. The rising ﬁlament pushes the overlying magnetc ﬁeld lines upwards, and the resulting losses
of pressure below form an inward magnetic force towards the neutral sheet. This force drives antiparallel magnetic ﬁled
lines to converge, leading to the formation of a current sheet, and magnetic reconnection begins to take place. Thus
the released energy heats the coronal plasma and also accelerates particles. The accelerated particles ﬂow downwards
from the reconnection site along the newly formed magnetic ﬁeld lines, and in the lower solar atmosphere, the ﬂare
ribbons are generated (Priest & Forbes 2002). The ﬂare ribbons observed in Hα and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths
are the conspicuous characteristics of solar ﬂares and are usually located on either sides of the polarity inversion line.
The ﬂare ribbons move apart during the reconnection process and the separation generally stops at the edge of the
sunspots. However, Li & Zhang (2009) reported that ﬂare ribbons sometimes sweep across the whole sunspots.

Sunspots are concentrations of magnetic ﬁelds and the overturning motion of the plasma is hindered by the strong
magnetic ﬁeld in the sunspot umbra (Gough & Tayler 1966). Bright structures within the umbra are signatures of not
completely suppressed convection, and light bridges are the best known representatives of these structures (Sobotka et
al. 1993; Borrero & Ichimoto 2011). The magnetic ﬁeld of light bridges is generally weaker and more inclined than the
local strong and vertical ﬁeld (Lites et al. 1991; Rueedi et al. 1995; Leka 1997; Jurˇc´ak et al. 2006). Recent simulations
and observations have shown that a light bridge’s magnetic ﬁeld is twisted and related to emerging magnetic ﬁelds
(Louis et al. 2015; Toriumi et al. 2015a,b; Yuan & Walsh 2016). Above the light bridges, some chromospheric activities
have been observed in the forms of jets and surges (Asai et al. 2001; Shimizu et al. 2009; Louis et al. 2014). Recently,
Yang et al. (2015) reported an oscillating light wall above a sunspot light bridge. The light wall is brighter than
the ambient areas while the wall top is much brighter than the wall body in 1330 ˚A. Hou et al. (2016) revealed that

Hou et al.

some light walls are multilayer and multithermal structures which occur along magnetic neutral lines in active regions
(ARs), not just above the light bridge. However, the work about the magnetic topology of the light wall is rare.

In this Letter, we report that a light wall (oscillating above a sunspot light bridge) is disturbed by a C8.0 ﬂare while
one ribbon of this ﬂare intrudes into the sunspot and overlaps the light bridge. The mean projective amplitude of light
wall’s oscillation increases at the pre-ﬂare stage, and decreases after the ﬂare. Using the coordinated observations from
the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014) and the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO ;
Pesnell et al. 2012), we investigate this event in detail for understanding the magnetic conﬁguration of the light wall.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

On 2015 August 28, a C8.0 ﬂare took place in NOAA AR 12403 with one ribbon intruding into the main sunspot
of the AR. Moreover, the ﬂare ribbon overlapped a light bridge inside the sunspot and disturbed the oscillation of
the light wall above this light bridge. From 23:09:50 UT on 2015 August 27 to 03:48:25 UT on August 28 , the IRIS
was pointed at AR 12403, and clearly observed the light wall, ﬂare and light bridge. We hence obtain a series of IRIS
slit-jaw 1330 ˚A images (SJIs) with a cadence of 18 s, a pixel scale of 0.′′333, and a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 120′′ ×
119′′. The 1330 ˚A channel contains emission from the strong C II 1334/1335 ˚A lines that are formed in the upper
chromosphere and transition region. To check the coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with this C8.0 ﬂare, we
also employ the images of the solar corona, taken by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on
board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO ; Brueckner et al. 1995).

Moreover, the observations of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard the SDO are used as well. The AIA takes full-disk images
in ten (E)UV channels with a cadence of 12 s and spatial sampling of 0.′′6 pixel−1. We adopt the observations of
AIA 131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 1600 ˚A, and 304 ˚A on 2015 August 28 to investigate the coupled
system consisting of the light wall, ﬂare, and light bridge. The full-disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms and the
intensitygrams from the HMI with a cadence of 45 s and a sampling of 0.′′5 pixel−1 are also applied.

3. RESULTS

The event of interest took place around the main sunspot of NOAA AR 12403 (see Figure 1 and movie1.mp4). On
2015 August 28, the AR approached the solar south-western limb and its overview is shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b).
Figures 1(c)-1(f) expand part of this region (see the green square in panel (a)) and display the light wall, ﬂare ribbons,
and light bridge in diﬀerent wavelengths, as well as a photospheric magnetogram. Combining the 1330 ˚A SJIs and
HMI intensitygrams, we detect a light wall (see the white arrow in panel (c)) above the sunspot light bridge (see the
red arrow in panel (e)). Checking the IRIS and the SDO observations, we notice that this light wall oscillated above
the light bridge from 2016 August 26 to August 29 until this region rotated to the farside of the Sun. On August 28, a
C8.0 two-ribbon ﬂare took place near the main sunspot around 02:42 UT. We delineate the two ribbons of the ﬂare by
blue and red dashed curves in 1600 ˚A image of panel (d) and duplicate them in panels (c), (e), and (f). The western
ﬂare ribbon (see the red dashed lines in panels (c)-(e)) overlapped the light bridge which was the observational base
of the light wall. The HMI LOS magnetogram in panel (f) shows that the overlapping ﬂare ribbon is located in strong
positive magnetic ﬁelds of the sunspot while the eastern ribbon in plage region with negative magnetic ﬁelds (see the
blue dashed lines in panels (d) and (f)).

To investigate the evolution of this C8.0 ﬂare, we check the SDO /AIA observations from 02:28 UT to 03:48 UT on
2015 August 28. In AIA 304 ˚A channel, a quiescent ﬁlament lay above the magnetic neutral line before the ﬂare’s
onset. Around 02:41 UT, this ﬁlament was partly activated (see Figure 2(a)). The C8.0 ﬂare started at 02:42 UT
and immediately at the onset of the ﬂare, the ﬂare loops exhibited apparent slipping motions. This phenomenon
is similar to the observations of Dud´ık et al.
(2014, 2016) and Li & Zhang (2015), implying the
occurrence of slipping magnetic reconnection. The brightening of the eastern footpoints of the ﬂare loops
gradually propagated towards the southeast, which developed into the eastern ﬂare ribbon. Meanwhile, the brightening
of the ﬂare loops’ western footpoints moved to the northwest (see the green arrows in panel (b)), forming the western
ﬂare ribbon. At 02:52 UT, the ﬂare increased to its maximum and the two ﬂare ribbons appeared on either side of
the neutral line (see panel (b)). During the next ten minutes, a dark ﬁlament material ﬂow from the northwest to
the southeast was detected between the two ﬂare ribbons (see the black line and arrow in panel (b)). Thus, we
consider the activation (or eruption) of the ﬁlament as the cause of this ﬂare. The hot ﬂare loops were observed well in
AIA 94 ˚A passband. We delineate these loops with black solid, dashed and dotted lines in panel (d) and duplicate them
to panel (c). Using the diﬀerential emission measure analysis method which is based on the “xrt dem iterative2.pro”
in the Solar Software package (Cheng et at. 2012), we obtain the temperature map as displayed in panel (e). The

light wall, flare and light bridge

3

temperature of the ﬂaring region increased signiﬁcantly and the outlines of hot loops are also obvious in panel (e). At
the top of the ﬂare loops (see the black square in panel (e)), the temperature reaches the maximum of about 9.0 MK.
Moreover, the LASCO C2 observations show that a CME is associated with the ﬁlament activation and this ﬂare. The
CME ejected with an average speed of 253 km s−1 and a width angle of 21◦ (see the LASCO C2 diﬀerence image in
panel (f)). The white plus symbol in panel (f) roughly marks the ﬂare’s location in the solar surface.

When the ﬂare occurred, its one ribbon intruded into the sunspot and overlapped the light bridge which was the
observational base of the oscillating light wall. To study the ﬂare’s disturbance to this light wall, temporal evolution
of the light wall is examined. We cut out a smaller FOV in IRIS 1330 ˚A SJIs (see the white square in Figure 1(c)) and
rotate it 130◦ anticlockwise, which are shown in Figures 3(a)-3(f). The panels (a)-(c) exhibit the light wall’s oscillation
before the onset of ﬂare. In the 1330 ˚A channel, the light wall is brighter than the ambient areas while its top and
base are brighter than the wall body. One of the ﬂare’s ribbons brightened successively, and approached the light wall
around 02:46 UT (see panel (c)). Then this ﬂare ribbon overlapped the light bridge and light wall completely between
02:47 UT and 02:51 UT. After that, the light wall kept oscillating above the light bridge (see panels (d)-(f)). But the
light wall’s oscillation was disturbed (see movie2.mp4). For more details about the disturbance, we make a space-time
plot along the slice “A-B” marked in panels (a)-(f) and display it in panel (g). The blue solid curve outlines the position
evolution of the light wall top, and the blue dashed line marks the light wall base. The mean period of the oscillation
is about 4.0 minutes. It is shown that after the T1 (02:13 UT) in panel (g), that is 30 minutes before the ﬂare ribbon’s
appearance, the oscillation amplitude of the light wall increased evidently and maintained at a high level until the ﬂare
ribbon approached the light wall at T2 (02:46 UT). Then the light wall oscillated with a smaller amplitude. These two
time points (T1 and T2) divide the whole process into three phases and we estimate an average projective maximum
height and oscillation amplitude of the light wall for each phase. The distance between the wall base and the wall
top is calculated as the height of the light wall. And we calculate the mean projective maximum height according
to the formula: Hmax = P
max is the projective height of wall top oscillation peak i in one cycle.
Moreover, the mean projective amplitude of the light wall’s oscillation is AM P = P
max
and H i
min are the projective heights of wall top oscillation peak i and valley i in one cycle. The calculated average
projective maximum heights of the light wall in the three phases are 2.7 Mm, 5.2 Mm, and 3.0 Mm, respectively. The
mean projective amplitudes of the light wall’s oscillation in three phases are separately 0.5 Mm, 1.6 Mm, and 0.6 Mm.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

With the high tempo-spatial IRIS and SDO observations, we detect a light wall oscillating with a mean period of
4.0 minutes above a sunspot light bridge in NOAA AR 12403. The light wall is brighter than the ambient regions
while the top and base of the light wall are much brighter than the wall body in 1330 ˚A channel. On 2015 August 28,
a C8.0 ﬂare caused by a ﬁlament’s activation occurred in this AR with the peak at 02:52 UT. We ﬁrst observe that one
of the ﬂare ribbons intruded into the sunspot and then overlapped the light bridge which was the observational base
of the light wall. As a result, the oscillation of light wall was obviously disturbed by the ribbon. The mean projective
oscillation amplitude of the light wall increased from 0.5 Mm to 1.6 Mm before the ﬂare, and decreased to 0.6 Mm
after the ﬂare. In addition, the images of the LASCO C2 on board the SOHO are adopted to study the CME related
to the C8.0 ﬂare. This ﬂare is an eruptive ﬂare which results in a CME with an average speed of 253 km s−1 and a
width angle of 21◦.

The light wall has been reported in several works. Yang et al.

(2015) reported an oscillating light wall above
a sunspot light bridge and interpreted the oscillations of the light wall as the leakage of p-modes from below the
photosphere. Hou et al.
(2016) revealed that some light walls are multilayer and multithermal structures which
occur along magnetic neutral lines in active regions. As a newfound structure, the light wall’s driving mechanism and
magnetic topology have not been well understood. The present work reports a C8.0 ﬂare disturbing a light wall above
a sunspot light bridge, which may contribute to the understanding of the light wall’s magnetic conﬁguration. Louis
et al. (2014) proposed that the dynamic chromospheric jets above the light bridge seem to be guided by the magnetic
ﬁeld lines. Tian et al.(2014) reported sub-arcsecond bright dots in the transition region above sunspots and suggested
that some of these bright dots appear to be located at the bases of magnetic loops. In this event, we suggest that the
light wall shares a group of magnetic ﬁeld lines with the ﬂare loops involved in magnetic reconnection process, and is
located at the bases of these magnetic loops. They constitute a coupled system (see Figure 4(a)). When the activated
ﬁlament begins to rise, the overlying ﬁeld lines, which connect the positive light bridge ﬁelds and the negative plage
ﬁelds, are pushed upwards before the ﬂare’s onset (between T1 and T2 in Figure 3(g)). Then the light wall turns to
close to the vertical direction (see Figure 4(b)). Due to the projection eﬀect, the observations along the LOS show

4

Hou et al.

the light wall’s mean projective maximum height increases from 2.7 Mm to 5.2 Mm. Around the T2 in Figure 3(g),
magnetic reconnection takes place (see Figure 4(c)). Underneath the reconnection site, the magnetic ﬁled lines with
smaller scales are newly formed and the ﬂare ribbons appear. As a result, the light wall turns to away from the vertical
direction (see Figure 4(d)). Thus, the average projective maximum height of light wall decreases remarkably to 3.0
Mm after the ﬂare (after the T2 in Figure 3(g)).

Checking the AIA 304 ˚A observations during the ﬂare’s evolution, we detect a quiescent ﬁlament lying above the
neutral line. When the ﬂare occurred, the dark material ﬂow was observed between the two ﬂare ribbons. Therefore,
we consider that this ﬁlament was partly activated and subsequently rose, leading to the C8.0 ﬂare. For eruptive ﬂares,
the vertical magnetic ﬁelds on both sides of the current sheet correspond to the legs of CME-related expanding ﬁeld
lines (Forbes et al. 2006; Aulanier et al. 2010). Here, we detect a CME associated with this ﬂare by LASCO C2 data,
which is consistent with the illustration in Figure 4.

give average projective maximum heights (H1, H2, and H3) and oscillation amplitudes (AM P 1, AM P 2, and AM P 3) of the
light wall for all the three phases. (An animation (movie2.mp4) of this ﬁgure is available.)

Figure 4. Schematic diagrams illustrating this study event. The black straight lines mark the locations of the ﬂare ribbons,
while the plus (+) and minus (-) symbols denote the polarities of the underneath magnetic ﬁelds. The black curves delineate
the magnetic ﬁeld lines, which connect the two ﬂare ribbons. The orange regions outline the light wall above the light bridge.
The red star symbols in panel (c) mark the reconnection sites. In panel (d), we compare the mean projective maximum heights
of the light wall at diﬀerent stages. “Ha” represents the mean projective maximum height of the light wall before the ﬂare’s
start. It increases to “Hb” when the magnetic ﬁeld lines are pushed upwards. After the magnetic reconnection takes place, the
mean projective maximum height of the light wall decreases from “Hb” to “Hd”.
