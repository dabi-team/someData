The Compact Spectrometer for Heavy Ion Experiment (CSHINE) is under construction for the study of
isospin chronology via the Hanbury Brown−Twiss (HBT) particle correlation function and the nuclear equation
of state of asymmetrical nuclear matter. The CSHINE consists of silicon strip detector (SSD) telescopes and
large-area parallel plate avalanche counters, which measure the light charged particles and ﬁssion fragments, re-
spectively. In phase I, two SSD telescopes were used to observe 30 MeV/u 40Ar +197Au reactions. The results
presented here demonstrate that hydrogen and helium were observed with high isotopic resolution, and the HBT
correlation functions of light charged particles could be constructed from the obtained data.

INTRODUCTION

The two-particle small-angle correlation function at small
relative momenta, originally developed by Hanbury Brown
and Twiss (HBT) [1], is a useful method for studying the
space-time characteristics of the nuclear reaction zone and
the emission order of particles in heavy ion reactions at in-
termediate beam energies [2–5]. In recent decades, the HBT
correlations of intermediate mass fragments and light parti-
cles have been widely measured [6–8], revealing many inter-
esting space-time features of heavy ion reactions. As demon-
strated in many experimental studies in nuclear physics over
a wide energy range, the application of silicon strip detectors
(SSDs) greatly improves the detector granularity and momen-
tum resolution and has enabled the output of numerous novel
and intriguing physical results [9–16]. Similarly, more pre-
cise measurement of the HBT correlation function using this
technique can be expected.

In addition, the isospin dynamics has attracted attention be-
cause it carries considerable information about the nuclear
symmetry energy [17–22], which is important not only in
heavy ion reactions but also in processes involving dense stel-
lar objects, including neutron star merging [23, 24]. To de-
termine the isospin migration rate, which reﬂects the effect
of the symmetry energy, it is necessary to measure the emis-
sion rate as a function of time of light charged particles with
different N /Z values from the reactions. This measurement
reveals the isospin chronology and requires high-resolution
determination of both the position and energy to reconstruct
the HBT correlation function, which must be done before the
isospin-dependent emission time constant can be derived. For
this purpose, position-sensitive detectors with high granular-
ity and particle identiﬁcation, for example, SSDs, are desired.
To experimentally measure the isospin chronology, we
built the Compact Spectrometer for Heavy Ion Experiments
(CSHINE). This paper discusses mainly the construction

and performance of the SSD telescopes in CSHINE. Af-
ter a brief introduction to the phase-I setup of CSHINE in
Sect. II, the performance of the SSD telescopes in the source
test and beam experiment are presented in Sect. III. Sec-
tion IV presents the α − α correlation function obtained in
the beam experiment and possible future applications. Sec-
tion V presents a summary.

II. CSHINE DETECTION SYSTEM AND BEAM
EXPERIMENT SETUP

In phase I, two main types of detectors are installed on
CSHINE: SSD telescopes for charged particle measurements
and parallel plate avalanche counters (PPACs) for ﬁssion frag-
ment measurements, which deliver the reaction geometry by
folding angle reconstruction. In addition, three Au(Si) sur-
face barrier telescopes are installed at large angles to measure
the evaporated particles. Each SSD telescope is a three-layer
detector with a single-sided SSD (SSSD) to measure ∆E1
(layer 1), a double-sided SSD (DSSD) to measure ∆E2 (layer
2), and a 3×3 CsI(Tl) array for residual energy measurements
(layer 3). Both the SSSD and DSSD are the BB7 type (2 mm
strip width, 32 strips per side) from MICRON Company. The
nominal thicknesses of these two layers of the SSD are 65
and 1500 µm, respectively. Owing to the 2 mm strip width,
the angular resolution in the beam experiment, which is a key
parameter for the measurement of the small-angle correlation
function, is better than 1◦.

Each CsI(Tl) crystal is a square pyramid with dimensions
of 23 × 23 mm2 on the front side and 27 × 27 mm2 on the
rear side and a height of 50 mm. The well-polished CsI(Tl)
crystals are wrapped with Teﬂon for good light reﬂection.
The entrance face is covered by 2-µm-thick single coat of
aluminized Mylar foil, and the other sides are packed with
black tape for tight light shielding. At the rear end of each
CsI(Tl) crystal, there is no wrapping material, and the crystal
is directly coupled to a S3204 photodiode (Hamamatsu) by
BC-630 optical grease (Saint-Gobain). Each SSD telescope
is mounted in an aluminum frame. The structural framework
of each SSD telescope is shown in Fig. 1.

Each SSD has an energy resolution of approximately 1%

Beam Line I in Lanzhou (RIBLL1) at the Heavy Ion Re-
search Facility in Lanzhou, China. A 197Au target with an
areal density of 1 mg/cm2 was bombarded with a 30 MeV/u
40Ar beam. Although the entire CSHINE detection system
contains six SSD telescopes and three PPACs, in phase I, two
SSD telescopes and three PPACs were mounted for the beam
experiment. The SSD telescopes were installed at forward
angles to detect light particles at mid-rapidity in coincidence
with the ﬁssion fragments measured by the three PPACs. A
graph illustrating the CSHINE detection system geometry in
the ﬁrst experiment is shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 lists the dis-
tance d from the center of each detector to the target, the polar
angle θ, the azimuthal angle φ, and the sensitive area S of the
two SSD telescopes and three PPACs in the experiment.

Each SSD telescope consists of one SSSD, one DSSD, and
one CsI(Tl) hodoscope containing 3 × 3 CsI(Tl) crystal units.
The SSSD has 32 readout strips on the front side, whereas
the DSSD has 32 readout strips on two sides perpendicular
to each other. A total of 96 individual silicon strips and 9
CsI(Tl) crystals require readout electronics. In a simple read-
out scheme, a compact pre-ampliﬁer (MPR-16, Mesytec) and
main ampliﬁer (MSCF-16, Mesytec) were used. The pulse
height of the signals carrying the energy information was dig-
itized by a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) (V785,
CAEN), and the timing information was digitized by a 12-bit
time-to-digital converter (V775, CAEN). Finally, all the digi-
tal signals were recorded on a hard disk event-by-event using
a data acquisition system based on the VME standard. Fig. 3
presents the data ﬂow of the SSD telescopes.

The CSHINE trigger system was designed for both the
beam experiment and calibration. Fig. 4 presents a diagram
of the trigger circuit. The timing signals of the PPACs were
discriminated by a CF8000 module and logically calculated
by a CO4020 module to generate the PPAC inclusive signals
and PPAC two-body coincidence signals. The logic hit sig-
nals of the SSD telescopes were obtained by the front side of
the DSSD (∆E2) and discriminated by the MSCF-16 mod-
ule, which generated an analog Multi-Trig signal proportional
to the number of ﬁred strips in this module (16 channels) and
sent it to the output on the rear panel. The Multi-Trig sig-
nals from all the MSCF-16 modules then proceeded to an
analog fan-in module (N625, CAEN) to form a summation
signal, the height of which represents the total multiplicity of
the ﬁred strips in the SSD telescopes. Then, both inclusive
and exclusive logic signals were generated by the discrimina-
tor (CF8000 module) at different threshold settings. The logic
hit signals of the Au(Si) telescopes were generated from the
Au(Si) surface barrier detector in layer 2 and logically added
by an LF4000 module to create the inclusive signal of the
Au(Si) telescopes. After the width and time delay of every
logic signal were adjusted, the trigger signal for the experi-
ment was constructed. The trigger signal contains the coinci-
dence of the PPAC two-body and SSD light charged particle
inclusive events and the SSD two-body events for data acqui-
sition in the beam experiment. In addition, the inclusive trig-
ger for each detector was also constructed and was optionally
turned on for detector calibration before or after beam data
acquisition.

cles, and the CsI(Tl) detector has an energy resolution of ap-
proximately 20% (FWHM) for this α source. The other type
of detector, the PPAC, is a gas detector with a large sensitive
area (240 × 280 mm2), a two-dimensional position resolu-
tion of approximately 1.35 mm, and a time resolution of less
than 300 ps. These PPAC detectors were described in detail
in Ref. [25].

III. PERFORMANCE OF SSD TELESCOPES AND
PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION

A. Energy resolution of SSDs and CsI(Tl) in α source test

Figure 5 presents the structure of the DSSD and its per-
formance during a test using a 5.15 MeV α source for SSD
telescope 1. Figure 5 (a) presents a photograph of the tele-
scope during assembly. Fig. 5 (b) shows the energy spectrum
of the α source for a single strip. Because the energy loss
of light charged particles in the DSSD will be much larger in
the beam experiment than that of 5.15 MeV α particles, low
ampliﬁcation was used so that the α peak appeared in low
channels. The two peaks at 5.15 and 5.49 MeV (239Pu and

241Am, respectively) can be separated clearly. Figure 5 (c)
shows the position of the main peak of the α source for all the
strips in this telescope. The energy responses are distributed
in a range corresponding to 120–180 ADC channels and show
signiﬁcant variation. Although the variation in the peak po-
sition is quite large, the energy resolution of all the strips re-
mains uniform at approximately 1% (FWHM), as shown in
Fig. 5 (d). The performance of this DSSD, which is installed
at a large angle, remains stable before and after the beam ex-
periment. Note, however, that the performance of the other
DSSD, which is located near the beam axis and receives more
irradiation, gradually deteriorated, as reﬂected by the increas-
ing leakage current. To solve this problem, our experience
with a recent experiment indicates that it is necessary to cool
the detector using an alcohol refrigerator so that both the leak-

beam experiment.

B. Signal sharing in SSD

4

Signal sharing is not negligible when the SSDs are used
because the interstrip distance is only 0.1 mm. When an inci-
dent particle strikes one strip in the detector, the neighboring
strips are likely to deliver a signal including a certain portion
of the total charge produced by ionization. The proportion of
signal sharing events affects the efﬁciency of particle identi-
ﬁcation. Taking the 65 µm SSSD as an example, Figure 7
(a) shows the energy correlation spectrum in two neighboring
strips in the α source test. Most events are recorded by one
strip; the amplitude of the signal is located at the full energy
position, and the signal of the neighboring strip is located in
the pedestal, as indicated by the two rectangles in the plot. In
addition, some events are located in the center of the coinci-
dent plot connecting the two main peaks, where the sum of
the energy of the two strips has a constant value correspond-
ing to the full energy of the incident α particle. Figure 7 (b)
presents the distribution of only signal-sharing events.

Fig. 7.
(Color online) Energy correlation spectrum between two
neighboring strips of the 65 µm SSSD for all (a) and only signal-
sharing (b) events.

Figure 8 (a) presents the multiplicity of the ﬁring strips in
the α test after a pedestal cut, Mstr, is applied. Most of the
events satisfy Mstr = 1 or 2, and the latter are contributed
mainly by signal sharing in neighboring strips. By counting
the events above the pedestal cut in the individual strips and
the signal-sharing events of neighboring strips, the ratio of
signal-sharing events on each strip is found to be less than 1%,
as shown in Fig. 8 (b). This ratio is used as a reference value
in the data analyses of the particle identiﬁcation efﬁciency.

C. Particle identiﬁcation

Figure 9 shows the scattering plot of the energy loss ∆E
in the DSSD transmission detector in layer 2 versus the en-
ergy E deposited in the CsI(Tl) crystal in the 30 MeV/u 40Ar
+197Au reaction. In the beam experiment, we focused on the
measurement of light charged particles; therefore, the energy

Figure 6 presents the same results, but for the 3 × 3 CsI(Tl)
array and the 5.15 MeV α source during ofﬂine calibration.
The energy resolution is only approximately 20% (FWHM)
[Fig. 6 (d)]. One possible reason for the low energy resolu-
tion of the CsI(Tl) array is that the α particle is stopped at
a depth of 27 µm in the CsI(Tl) material (as calculated by
LISE++ [26]), which is much less than the total length of the
CsI(Tl) crystal (50 mm). The light response is signiﬁcantly
suppressed, and the light transport efﬁciency is low. During
the beam experiment, the energy resolution for particles with
a larger stopping depth will be much higher (see text below).

stopping depth of the 5.15 MeV α particles is very small at
the surface. Because the data points are located around the
trend curve, as shown in Fig. 9, the bandwidth is attributed
to the ﬁnite energy resolution of the SSDs and CsI(Tl) array.
To extract the energy resolution of the CsI(Tl) array and the
DSSD, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted. By varying
the energy resolution of both units [∆E for the DSSD and E
for CsI(Tl)], different broadening of the mass spectrum can be
simulated, and the mass resolution can be derived. This pro-
cedure can be performed in a divided range on the ∆E − E
plot. Fig. 11 presents the experimental mass spectrum (a) and
∆E − E plot (b), which are compared to the MC simulations
in (c) and (d), respectively. The σ value from the Gaussian ﬁt
of the α mass distribution is used to estimate the energy res-
olution. By comparing the width of the simulated mass peak
with the experimental results, one can estimate the energy res-
olutions of both units, which are found to be correlated.

in layer 1 is very small and is not presented here. The spec-
trum shows that the isotopes of Z = 1 and 2 elements are
clearly separated in the entire measuring energy range. The
mass resolution was obtained using the linearization method.
Brieﬂy, the band of each isotope can be described by a trend
curve obtained by ﬁtting manually chosen marker points with
a 14-parameter function. Each curve represents the mass of
the corresponding isotope. Then, during data sorting, for each
particle with a given (∆E - E) value, the vertical distances
between the point (∆E - E) and the two neighboring curves
deﬁne the experimental mass number. Figure 10 presents the
mass number spectra for Z = 1 (a) and Z = 2 (b) isotopes.
By ﬁtting each peak with a Gaussian function, the mass reso-
lution can be derived. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), a mass resolu-
tion of ∆M = 0.1 can be obtained for α particles. The acqui-
sition of a full scattering plot with high efﬁciency requires a
sophisticated pattern recognition algorithm. The entire proce-
dure for determining the tracks using the event-by-event logic
for events with a total multiplicity of M = 1 and 2 will be re-
ported elsewhere.

From the mass resolution, one can deduce the energy res-
olution of the CsI(Tl) detector, which is expected to be better
in the beam experiment than in the α source test because the

a function of the resolution ∆E of the DSSD and E of the
CsI(Tl) array in three E ranges. As both parameters increase,
the variation in the mass distribution increases. The slopes
of the contour curves are different because of the bending
of the ∆E − E band, as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, the en-

and E for CsI(Tl) in three E ranges (in units of ADC channels) of

near the curve is the total mass resolution obtained in the simulation.
The dashed curves correspond to the mass resolution obtained from
the experimental data in each interval.

ergy resolutions of the DSSD and CsI(Tl) contribute different
weights to the total mass resolution in each range. The dashed
curves in the plot represent the approximate total experimen-
tal mass resolution in the selected E range. A comparison
of Figs. 12 (a), (b), and (c) reveals that the experimental en-
ergy resolution of the DSSD, including the intrinsic energy
resolution and hit pattern recognition error, is approximately
σ∆E = 1.1% (1 σ), which is consistent with the result of
the α source test, whereas the energy resolution of CsI(Tl)
in the beam experiment is approximately σE = 2% (1σ), as
indicated by the green bands. These results for the energy
resolution of the SSD and CsI(Tl) are essential for physical
analyses of the HBT correlation function.

D. CsI(Tl) energy calibration

The calibration of the CsI(Tl) unit is an important issue in
the application of SSD telescopes [27]. The energy response
of the SSD is linear and independent of the particle species,
and it can be calibrated using an α source and a precision
pulse generator. However, the signal response of the CsI(Tl)
scintillators is nonlinear and depends on the particle charge
and mass. Ideally, the absolute energy calibration of CsI(Tl)
detectors requires various particle species with well-deﬁned
charges, masses, and energies, which can be obtained using
the primary beam delivered by an accelerator.

However, because accelerator time is costly, we use a sim-
pler method that is widely employed. The CsI(Tl) signal re-
sponses are calibrated with the deposited particle energies us-
ing the ∆E − E plot. Because the SSD is well-calibrated,
from the plot one can read multiple points on the curve fol-
lowing each isotope, where ∆E is calibrated in MeV and E
is calibrated using the raw ADC channel number. Given the
nominal value of the thickness of the DSSD from the manu-
facturer and ∆E (MeV), the total energies and residual ener-

gies E (MeV) in the CsI(Tl) can be computed for all points
using the LISE++ code [26]. The relationship between the
ADC channel number and the energy deposited (MeV) in
CsI(Tl) can be established. Figure 13 presents the energy cal-
ibration of Z = 1 isotopes (a) and Z = 2 isotopes (b) for
CsI(Tl). The response of CsI(Tl) is nonlinear and moderately
dependent on the charge and mass of the light charged par-
ticles. Moreover, a change in the nominal thickness of the
DSSD by a few percent has a very insigniﬁcant effect on the
CsI(Tl) calibration.

IV. APPLICATION OF SSD TELESCOPES AND FUTURE
USES OF CSHINE

SSD telescopes have been used mainly to measure the HBT
correlation functions of light charged particles in the reaction
30 MeV/u 40Ar + 197Au. The α − α correlation function can
be used to check the performance and calibration of the de-
tector. There are three peaks in the relative momentum spec-
trum of α pairs, which originate mainly from the decay of
the resonant states of 8Be and 9Be. The malfunctioning of
the telescope would result in an incorrect α − α correlation
function.

Figure 14 shows the α − α correlation function obtained
by the two SSD telescopes. Various peaks are expected to
appear in the correlation function. The peaks at 20 and 100
MeV/c correspond to the decay of the unstable ground state
and 3.04 MeV excited state of 8Be, respectively, whereas the
peak at 50 MeV/c corresponds to the decay of the 2.43 MeV
excited state of 9Be [28]. The positions of the three peaks are
in agreement with the theoretical predictions, suggesting that
the performance of the SSD telescopes is acceptable.

Isospin dynamics are very important for understanding the
effect of nuclear symmetry energy in nuclear collisions. By
using the SSD telescopes in CSHINE, the correlation func-
tions of different particle pairs can be measured to extract the
emission time constant and emission hierarchy of the species.
In addition, the isotope-resolved particles in coincidence with
the ﬁssion fragments measured using the PPACs in CSHINE
also carry information on the reaction dynamics. Thus, the
CSHINE detection system is a useful tool for research on
the reaction dynamics and thermodynamics of nuclear matter
produced in heavy ion collisions in the Fermi energy regime.

were used to construct the HBT correlation functions for light
charged particles. The performance was evaluated using the
α − α correlation function, and the three resonant states of
8Be and 9Be were correctly identiﬁed. CSHINE can be ex-
pected to offer opportunities for experimental studies of the
collision dynamics and nuclear equation of state in heavy ion
reactions at Fermi energies.

V. SUMMARY

In summary, phase I of the CSHINE detection system,
which consists of two SSD telescopes, three PPACs, and
three Au(Si) telescopes, was mounted and operated in the 30
MeV/u 40Ar + 197Au reaction. The data analysis focusing on
the SSD telescopes demonstrated that hydrogen and helium
isotopes were clearly identiﬁed using the ∆E − E method.
The interstrip signal sharing in the SSSD is below 1%. The
energy resolutions of the DSSD and CsI(Tl) are found to be
approximately 1% and 2%, respectively. The SSD telescopes
