ABSTRACT

CK Vul or Nova 1670 is an enigmatic eruptive object which underwent a stellar-merger event recorded by seventeenth-century ob-
servers. Its remnant was recently recovered at submillimeter wavelengths, revealing gas of an extraordinary isotopic composition
indicative of past processing in the CNO cycles and partial He burning. Here, we present long-slit optical spectra of the remnant
acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope at an unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage. The spectra cover fea-
tures of key elements – including H, He, C, N, and O – at ionization degrees I–III. A classical analysis of the spectra allows us to
identify several spatio-kinematic components in the probed part of the nebula at electron temperatures of 10–15 kK and densities of
200–600 cm−3. We ﬁnd that the nebula is most likely excited by shocks rather than by direct radiation of the stellar remnant. We
provide a detailed analysis of the elemental abundances in the remnant and ﬁnd that helium is twice more abundant than in the Sun.
Nitrogen is also overabundant with a N/O ratio ten times larger than the solar one. These anomalous abundances strongly indicate
that the observed gas was processed in CNO cycles of H burning, consistent with the submillimeter studies. Additionally, sub-solar
abundances of heavier elements, such as Ne, S, and Ar, suggest that the progenitor of CK Vul was formed from material poorer in
metals than the Sun and was therefore an old stellar system before the 1670 eruption.

1. Introduction

CK Vulpeculae (CK Vul) is a remnant of a naked-eye stellar
eruption observed in 1670–72 (Hevelius 1671; Shara et al. 1985).
For a long time it was considered a classical nova (that is, a ther-
monuclear explosion on an accreting white dwarf), despite its
unusual light curve that displayed three peaks over a time span
of nearly three years. The stellar remnant is not seen in the opti-
cal but a faint hourglass nebula is visible around the presumable
position of the 1670 nova (Shara & Moﬀat 1982; Shara et al.
1985; Hajduk et al. 2007). The stellar object is however rela-
tively bright in the far infrared (Evans et al. 2002; Kami´nski et
al. 2015a). This implies that the stellar remnant is obscured by
an opaque dusty envelope whose sole presence is yet another
argument against the classical nova scenario. Provoked by the
enigma, Kami´nski et al. (2015a) launched a pioneering spectro-
scopic study of CK Vul at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths
using the APEX telescope and the Submillimeter Array (SMA).
The observations revealed that it is a strong and rich source of
molecular emission. Kami´nski et al. concluded that the 1670
eruption was that of a red nova rather than a classical nova –
a hypothesis already discussed in the past (Kato 2003; Tylenda
et al. 2013).

It was the 2002 eruption of V838 Monocerotis (e.g., Munari
et al. 2002) which raised a wide interest and allowed astrophysi-
cists to deﬁne a new class of stellar eruptions named red novae
or red transients. An increasingly red color implying a decreas-
ing eﬀective temperature is the primary characteristic of red no-
vae. After the eruption, lasting a month up to a few years in the
optical, the transients decline as very late M-type supergiants al-
though they remain bright in the infrared for decades (or longer).
Following a discussion of diﬀerent mechanisms responsible for

(cid:63) Submillimeter Array Fellow

red-nova eruptions, Soker & Tylenda (2003) and next Tylenda
& Soker (2006) proposed a binary merger as the scenario that
best explains the observations of red novae. A 2008 eruption of
V1309 Scorpii (Mason et al. 2010) was crucial for solving the
red nova enigma. Using archival photometry of the object se-
cured by the OGLE project (Udalski 2003) and available for six
years prior to the 2008 eruption, Tylenda et al. (2011) showed
that before the eruption V1309 Scorpii was a contact binary with
a rapidly decreasing orbital period.

Submillimeter spectroscopy revealed a very rich molecular
enviroment of CK Vul’s remant (Kami´nski et al. 2015a, 2017).
Kami´nski et al. (2017) identiﬁed over 320 unique spectral fea-
tures belonging to 27 molecules and their isotopologues. It has
since been established that molecular emission at submm wave-
lengths is a common feature of Galactic red-nova remnants
(Kami´nski et al. 2018a). The great advantage of measuring rota-
tional molecular lines at submm wavelengths is that they allow
to determine the isotopic composition of the observed molecu-
lar matter. Kami´nski et al. (2017) derived isotopic ratios of ﬁve
elements in CK Vul: C, N, O, Si, and S. The isotopes of C, N,
and O are of a particular importance as their isotopic ratios can
reveal what nuclear burning processes occurred in the progenitor
and, perhaps, during the merger. Kami´nski et al. concluded that
the gas currently seen in the remnant was processed in the CNO
cycles of H-burning and underwent partial He burning.

Recently, very sensitive spectroscopy of CK Vul, acquired
with mm-wave interferometers ALMA and NOEMA, led to a
discovery of the rare isotopologue of aluminum ﬂuoride that
contains the radioactive isotope of aluminum, 26AlF (Kami´nski
et al. 2018b). This was the ﬁrst astronomical observation of a
radioactive isotopologue in a stellar object, demonstrating once
again the extraordinary properties of the CK Vul remnant. The
observation yields a very low 27Al/26Al ratio of about 7 which

indicates that the gas in the remnant had to be recently processed
in the hot Mg–Al cycles of H-burning. Most probably, the unsta-
ble isotope of Al comes from the outer layers of a He-core of a
red giant disrupted in the merger that was witnessed in 1670–72.
Eyres et al. (2018) questioned this interpretation and, based on
a current low luminosity (1–10 L(cid:12)) and potential overabundance
of Li in the remnant (Hajduk et al. 2013), proposed instead that
Nova 1670 was a merger of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf.

Unfortunately, the submm spectroscopy alone cannot pro-
vide us with a quntitative measure of elemental abundances,
which would be very useful for constraining the nature of the
CK Vul’s progenitor. Judging from a particularly high strength of
lines of N-bearing molecules, Kami´nski et al. (2017) suggested
however that nitrogen is overabundant in the remnant (see also
Shara et al. 1985); similarly, the C/O ratio could be close to or
slightly above one (see also Evans et al. 2016).

The optical nebula of CK Vul oﬀers a possibility of deriving
stringent constraints on the elemental abundances in the rem-
nant. The abundances can be derived from nebular line intensi-
ties using well-established analysis methods commonly applied
to planetary nebulae, H ii regions, and active galactic nuclei (e.g.
Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). However, the nebular regions of
CK Vul are very weak and spectra of CK Vul obtained thus far
(Shara et al. 1985; Hajduk et al. 2007, 2013) are of modest qual-
ity so that only a few strongest lines have been measured. This
has hampered any advanced study of elemental abundances in
this peculiar object. Here we present (Sects. 2–3) and analyze
(Sects. 3–4) an optical spectrum of CK Vul nebula obtained at
an unprecedented sensitivity. With this spectrum, we are able
to derive the elemental abundances for the brightest part of the
CK Vul nebula (Sect. 5) and discuss their origin (Sect. 6).

2. Observations

CK Vul was observed with X-shooter (Vernet et al. 2011) at the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 29 Jul, and 15, 17, 18, and 27
Aug 2017. X-shooter records spectra simultaneously in three
spectroscopic arms: UVB (300–560 nm), VIS (550–1020 nm),
and NIR (1020–2480 nm). The atmospheric dispersion corrector
(ADC) was correcting the observations for the diﬀerential at-
mospheric refraction. This correction is particularly relevant for
our observations as they took place at airmass 1.6–1.8. The vi-
sual seeing had a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 7–
1(cid:48)(cid:48). 3. The slit has a length of 11(cid:48)(cid:48). We set slit widths to 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 3
for the UVB arm and to 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 2 for the VIS and NIR arms. This
resulted in spectral resolutions, λ/∆λ, of 4100, 6500, 4300 in
the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms, respectively. The stare observ-
ing mode was used to increase the observing eﬃciency for the
UVB and VIS arms but it compromised the quality of the NIR
part of the spectra. With the large extent of the nebula of CK Vul
of 71(cid:48)(cid:48) (Hajduk et al. 2013), it would be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd
a nearby nodding position resulting in optimal sky extraction
along the entire slit and therefore stare mode was a reasonable
choice. The UVB and VIS detectors were used in their slow-
readout mode with high gain and 1×2 binning. The exposure
times per observing block were 3030 and 3060 s for UVB and
VIS arms, respectively, adding to about 6 h of on-source obser-
vations. Telluric standards, Hip095400, Hip095340, Hip090637,
Hip107734, Hip101716, and Hip098609, and spectrophotomet-
ric standards, Feige 110 and EG 274, were observed with the
same instrumental setup.

The observations were intended to secure a deep spectrum
along the brightest part of the optical nebula. The nebula itself
is too faint for direct pointing of the telescope. For this reason,

the observations were executed with the so-called blind-oﬀset
procedure in which the demanded position of the slit is given
with respect to a brighter ﬁeld star. This ﬁeld source is ﬁrst
used for ﬁne positioning of the telescope after which the tele-
scope is slewed to the main target with the implemented oﬀ-
sets. The resulting slit positions are overlaid in Fig. 1 on an aver-
age X-shooter acquisition image in the R-band ﬁlter and on the
Gemini/GMOS image from Hajduk et al. (2013) in the Hα ﬁl-
ter from 2010. Point sources were subtracted in the latter image
to enhance the nebular emission. X-shooter acquisition images
are taken immediately before each spectroscopic exposure. We
corrected the images for bias and ﬂat-ﬁeld and combined them
with swarp (Bertin et al. 2002). We oriented the slit at a posi-
tion angle (PA) of 13◦.0 which is aligned with the northern jet
of the atomic emission (cf. Kami´nski et al. 2015a). The southern
edge of the slit partially overlaps with two background stars. The
brighter one Hajduk et al. (2013) recognized as a variable source
(their "variable 1"). The slit is close but does not overlap with
the expected location of the stellar remnant of CK Vul. The pre-
dicted location of the star CK Vul, marked with a cross in Fig. 1,
is based on observations of its submm continuum (Kami´nski et
al. 2018b). The full extent of the slit corresponds to distances
of 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 4–8(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 to North-East and 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 4–3(cid:48)(cid:48). 0 to South-West from that
position.

The spectroscopic data were processed with the ESO X-
shooter pipeline (Modigliani et al. 2010) version v3.1.0 with
standard procedures resulting in two-dimensional spectra cali-
brated in wavelength and ﬂux. The wavelength calibration has
typical uncertainties of about 0.02, 0.03 nm in VIS and UVB
spectra, respectively. Background sky correction turned out to
be a very sensitive aspect of the data reduction because the neb-
ula and ﬁeld stars ﬁll almost fully the slit and the oﬀ-source sky
signal could not be adequately sampled. This problem particu-
larly aﬀected the removal of airglow emission lines. The VIS
data were further corrected for telluric absorption with Molecﬁt
version 1.4.0 (Kausch et al. 2015; Smette et al. 2015) using the
telluric standards. This correction was imperfect, as well, and
left residuals in the regions of the strongest telluric absorption.
The wavelength scale of all spectra was then shifted to the he-
liocentric rest frame and spectra were combined. Some obvious
instrumental artifacts were blanked in the spectra by hand. The
two-dimensional spectra have a typical rms noise of 1.6×10−19
erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1 and the highest recorded signal-to-noise is of
665 at the default pipeline pixel binning of 0.2 Å×0(cid:48)(cid:48). 16.

3. The spectrum and its spatial characteristics

Figure 2 presents a global spectrum obtained by summing the
ﬂux over the entire extent of the source along the slit. The upper
panel shows the UBV spectrum while the middle and bottom
panels present the VIS spectrum. We omit the spectrum between
740 and 850 nm as it lacks any spectral features. The identiﬁca-
tion of the most relevant features is shown with red markers. The
identiﬁed lines are also listed in Tables 1–3. Note that at wave-
lengths longer than about 870 nm the spectrum is often contami-
nated by residua of the imperfect telluric correction (see Sect. 2).
Over 40 spectral features belonging to eleven elements (H, He,
C, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, Fe, Ni, and Ca) at three ionization states (I–
III) were identiﬁed. The presence of some lines, such as the D
doublet of Na i, is doubtful owing to interstellar contamination.
Most lines typically observed in planetary nebulae can be
found in the spectrum of CK Vul. However, lines of neutral
species – i.e., [O i], [N i], and [C i] – are signiﬁcantly stronger

in CK Vul than in a typical planetary nebula (e.g. Górny 2014).
Also, emission of singly ionized metals – i.e., [Fe ii], [Ni ii], and
[Ca ii] – which are absent in the spectra of planetary nebulae,
can easily be identiﬁed in Fig. 2. These diﬀerences may signify
that the excitation mechanism of the CK Vul’s nebular emission
is diﬀerent from that in planetary nebulae, i.e. is diﬀerent than
direct ionization by the radiation of the central star. We return to
this point in Sect. 6.1.

The quality of our spectrum warrants reliable estimates of
the physical conditions in the probed part of the nebula, includ-
ing the electron temperature, Te, and electron density, Ne. The
ﬂuxes of lines [O iii] 438.3, [N ii] 575.5, and [S iii] 631.2,1 which
are necessary to determine Te, can be reliably measured. Even
the [C i] 872.7 transition, although very weak, can be measured
in one kinematical component, enabling another estimate of Te.
The electron density can be derived from the line ratios of [O ii]
372.6/372.9, [S ii] 671.6/673.1, and [N i] 519.8/520.0. The lines
of [O ii] and [N i] are partially blended in our spectrum but are
suﬃciently well resolved to derive their ratios. Having deter-
mined Te and Ne, one can derive the ion abundances and then
estimate the abundances of individual elements. For details of
the nebular spectrum analysis, see e.g. Chapter 4 and 5 in Oster-
brock & Ferland (2006).

Proﬁles of the emission lines in CK Vul show a complex
kinematical sub-structure, distinct for diﬀerent species and ion-
ization levels. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows two-
dimensional distributions of emission in Hβ, [O iii] 500.7, and
[N ii] 658.3 along the slit as a function of velocity (or wave-
length). The emission covers a wide range of radial velocities,
generally from ∼–350 to ∼+300 km s−1, but the velocity range
depends on the line and the position along the slit. The main
emission concentrates in two ‘wings’ forming a structure with
a shape of the letter ‘V’ (Fig. 3). Hereafter, we refer to the left
(negative-velocity) ‘wing’ as component A and the right one as
component B. At a velocity of about –300 km s−1 and a position
−2(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 along the slit, there is also a weaker emission feature which
we identify as component C. The three components are roughly
indicated in the bottom right panel of Fig. 3.

1 All lines in this paper are identiﬁed by their laboratory air wavelength
in nm.

As can be seen in Fig. 3, the emission in Hβ comes from all
three components. This is obviously also the case for the other
identiﬁed H i lines. Emission of He i is observed in components
A and B but is almost absent in component C. Instead, the [N ii]
emission is concentrated in components A and C. This is also
true for all lines of singly ionized and neutral species, i.e. [O i],
[O ii], [N i], [S ii], etc. Component B dominates the emission in
the [O iii] lines and the lines from other doubly ionized species
([Ne iii], [S iii], and [Ar iii]). The components readily diﬀer in
excitation conditions. Speciﬁcally, the excitation of plasma in
component B is signiﬁcantly higher than in components A and
C.

Because of these excitation diﬀerences, we did not analyze
the global spectrum presented in Fig. 2, but rather disentangled
the spectra of individual spatio-kinematic components and ana-
lyzed them separately. However, A and B are partially blended
and the degree of blending depends on the range of pixels chosen
for summing along the slit. After several attempts to optimize
this separation, we took three spatial cuts shown in the bottom
right panel of Fig. 3 with dashed lines. Spectrum 1 was obtained
by summing emission in pixels located within a region between
l=–0(cid:48)(cid:48). 64 to 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 30 with respect to the slit center (with negative
values representing the direction towards South-West). This cen-
tral spectrum extraction includes the maximum emission of the
strongest lines. Spectrum 2 was extracted by adding ﬂuxes for
1(cid:48)(cid:48). 75≤ l ≤ 4(cid:48)(cid:48). 14. In this spectrum, components A and B are bet-
ter separable than in spectrum 1 but the line emission is weaker,
especially in component B. A third spectrum was produced by
summing the ﬂux in –2(cid:48)(cid:48). 60≤ l ≤ –2(cid:48)(cid:48). 25, meant to study compo-
nent C.

4. Line intensities and extinction

Figure 4 displays typical line proﬁles in spectrum 1, representing
the central extraction. The Hβ emission displays two clear peaks
corresponding to components A and B. The [O iii] line shows
a single component arising from region B. Contrary to this, the
[N ii] line arises mainly in component A.

As is best seen in the Hβ proﬁle in Fig. 4, the emission of
components A and B is partially blended. We disentangled them
by ﬁtting two Gaussian proﬁles to the observed features. The

individual Gaussian proﬁles are plotted with dotted curves and
their sum is shown with a dashed curve. We adopted the integral
over the ﬁtted Gaussian as the ﬂux of the corresponding compo-
nent. To have consistent measurements, the procedure of ﬁtting
a Gaussian proﬁle was also applied to lines showing a single
component, e.g to the [O iii] line in Fig. 4.

The results of the Gaussian ﬁts to the emission line proﬁles
of spectrum 1 are presented in Table 1. They include measure-
ments of the ﬂux (within the deﬁned extraction aperture which
was diﬀerent for the three spectra), relative ﬂux (scaled so that
Hβ has a value of 100), central radial velocity (Vr), FWHM, and
an estimate of ﬂux uncertainties (column headed "Note").

The radial velocity of component A in spectrum 1, calcu-
lated as the mean radial velocity of lines with good Gaussian
ﬁts, is (cid:104)Vr(cid:105)=–116 km s−1. The mean FWHM, calculated in the
same way is (cid:104)θ(cid:105)=112 km s−1. This value includes the instru-
mental broadening. FWHM of the instrumental proﬁle, as es-
timated from airglow lines, is (cid:39) 35 km s−1. Thus, FWHM of
component A in spectrum 1 corrected for instrumental broad-
ening is (cid:104)θc(cid:105)=106 km s−1. The same ﬁgures for component B are
13 km s−1 and 100 km s−1 ((cid:104)θc(cid:105)=94 km s−1), respectively.

Figure 5 is analogues to Fig. 4 and displays line proﬁles and
Gaussian ﬁts for spectrum 2 extracted in the East-North part of
the slit. In this region, components A and B are easier to separate
than in spectrum 1. Component B is much weaker than compo-
nent A. The proﬁle of [N ii] 658.3 in component A is not well
reproduced by the Gaussian. It is narrower and shifted to more
negative velocities than the proﬁle of Hβ. Readily, component A
has a somewhat more complex structure in spectrum 2 than in
1. The derived line parameters are summarized in Table 2. The
meaning of the columns is the same as in Table 1.

In spectrum 2, the mean radial velocity and the mean FWHM
for component A are (cid:104)Vr(cid:105)=–141 km s−1 and (cid:104)θ(cid:105)=136 km s−1
((cid:104)θc(cid:105)=131 km s−1), while for component B these ﬁgures are
(cid:104)Vr(cid:105)=143 km s−1 and (cid:104)θ(cid:105)=132 km s−1 ((cid:104)θc(cid:105)=127 km s−1). The
separation of the components in spectrum 2 is greater than in
spectrum 1 and the line proﬁles in spectrum 1 are somewhat
wider. The latter is partially due to the larger range of pixels
included in extraction of spectrum 2 compared to spectrum 1.

Spectrum 3 was obtained solely to study component C (see
Fig. 3). There is a component produced by blending A and B in
this spectrum but it is well separated from C and does not aﬀect

radial velocity of component C is (cid:104)Vr(cid:105)=–285 km s−1, while the
mean FWHM of the lines is (cid:104)θ(cid:105)=84 km s−1((cid:104)θc(cid:105)=76 km s−1).

The spectra are heavily reddened. We corrected the spec-

reproduce the right ratio of Hα to Hβ as it is most sensitive to
the value of extinction. Other Balmer lines are rather faint in the
observed spectrum so their measured ﬂuxes are subject to larger
errors. Table 4 presents the extinction-corrected ﬂuxes normal-
ized to Hβ and multiplied by 100. The ﬁrst row names the spec-

5. Derivation of Te, Ne, and abundances

Determination of the elemental abundances in CK Vul is the pri-
mary goal of the present study. The theory of line emission pro-
cesses in nebular conditions is well understood (e.g. Ch. 4 and
5 in Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). There are two kinds of line-
excitation mechanisms relevant for ionized nebulae. The lines of
H i, He i, and He ii are emitted mainly due to recombination of
the H and He ions. The lines of heavier elements, mostly for-
bidden ones, are produced by collisional excitation of the lowest
levels of neutral atoms and ions with free electrons.

We performed the analysis of collisionally excited (forbid-
den) lines in CK Vul by solving the statistical-equilibrium equa-
tion for a given electron temperature and density and in a ﬁve-
level model of a given ion (atom).3 The necessary radiative prob-

3 As we argue later on in this paper, the matter in the investigated nebu-
lar region of CK Vul can be out of the ionization and thermal equilibria.
One may think that in that case the assumption of statistical equilib-
rium is not satisﬁed as well, aﬀecting the ionic level populations. How-
ever, the processes governing the level populations are much faster than
those governing the ionization state. In our case (Ne (cid:39) 500 cm−3 and
Te (cid:39) 104 K), the collisional excitation and de-excitation of low-lying
levels of atoms and ions proceeds on a time scale of hours, while the re-
combination of ionized hydrogen takes hundreds of years. The physical
conditions (Ne and Te) in the nebular region of CK Vul certainly do not
vary on a time scale of hours or days (this region has been observed for

Notes. The ﬁrst two columns identify the lines. The four subsequent
columns present results of Gaussian ﬁts to component C. Notation as in
Table 2.

[C i], [N ii], [O iii], and [S iii]. The same was performed for the
(2D3/2 −4S )/(2D5/2 −4S ) line ratio of [N i], [O ii], and [S ii] which
yields estimates of the electron density, Ne.

The results are given in Table 5. The ﬁrst part of the table
gives our estimates of Te. They rely on the quality of the (1S −1D)
lines, which are often faint in our spectra. Hence the accuracy of
the Te determinations, included in Table 5, corresponds to the
quality of measurements of this transition. For further analy-
sis, we adopt the most reliable values of Te, that is we take a
mean value of Te([O iii]) and Te([S iii]) to represent region B1
and Te([N ii]) in regions A1 and A2. In region B2 we have no re-
liable estimate of Te. Since the spectrum of this region shows a
similar degree of excitation as that of region B1, we adopted for
region B2 the same Te as for region B1, i.e. Te=15000 K. Region
C, where we cannot reliably estimate Te, exhibits similar excita-
tion as regions A1 and A2. Therefore, we adopted Te=10000 K
for region C.

The second part of Table 5 presents our estimates of Ne. For
further analysis of regions A1, A2, and C, we adopted mean val-
ues of Ne derived from the line ratios of [O ii] and [S ii]. In the
case of regions B1 and B2, no measurements of line ratios sen-
sitive to Ne are available. Instead, we estimated Ne from com-
paring the surface brightness of Hβ in regions A and B. Note
that the emissivity in Hβ is proportional to N2
e . As can be seen
in Fig. 4, Hβ is slightly stronger in region B1 than in region A1.
Therefore, we adopted Ne=600 cm−3 for region B1. Similarly,
comparing the Hβ ﬂux in region B2 to that in A2 (see Fig. 5), we
adopted Ne=200 cm−3 for B2. Note that the ion abundances are
rather insensitive to the actual value of Ne in the range relevant
for our spectra, i.e., for Ne (cid:46) 104 cm−3 (see also below).

As can be seen in Table 5, the [N ii] ratio in region B1
yields Te=26500 K. This is much higher than the temperature

The electron temperature, Te, was derived by adjusting the
model (1S −1 D)/(1D −3 P) line ratio to the observed values of

decades). Thus, the statistical equilibrium can be safely adopted when
calculating the populations of low-lying levels of atoms and ions.

derived from the line ratio of [O iii] or [S iii]. The discrepancy
may suggest that the density in region B1 is actually higher
than the adopted value of 600 cm−3. Indeed, Te derived from
the [N ii] ratio is more sensitive to Ne than in cases of [O iii]
and [S iii], especially at higher Ne. Our calculations show that
at Ne=4 × 104 cm−3 the three line ratios would indicate similar
temperatures of about 13800 K. At this high density, however,
the emissivity of Hβ in region B1 would be almost 104 times

higher than that in region A1, whereas the measured ﬂuxes of
Hβ in regions A1 and B1 are comparable (Table 1). This implies
that the volume occupied by nebular matter in region B1 is ∼ 104
times smaller than in region A1. Yet, the extent along the slit
and in the range of radial velocities of component B are simi-
lar to that of component A (Fig. 3). The only way to reconcile
these contradictions is to propose a two-phase structure of re-
gion B1. Namely that the bulk of the emission comes from a thin

(Ne ≈ 600 cm3) medium of high excitation (doubly ionized O,
Ne, S, and Ar), in which there are small but dense inclusions of
low ionization that give rise to the [N ii] emission.

Having determined Te and Ne, we calculated the emissivity
of Hβ and of the forbidden lines, see e.g. Ch. 5.11 in Osterbrock
& Ferland (2006). Comparing the emissivity in a given line nor-
malized to Hβ with the corresponding measured intensities, we
obtained the ion abundances relative to ionized hydrogen. The
results are given in Table 5.

We next discuss uncertainties in the derived abundances. The
accuracy of ionic abundances depend mainly on the precision of
measurements of the line intensities. When calculating the ionic
abundances, we used the strongest lines of a given ion, i.e. the
lines whose ﬂuxes were most accurately measured. For example,
the abundance of O++ was obtained from the sum of the ﬂux of
[O iii] 495.9 and 500.7. Thus, at this stage, the derived values are
accurate to a few percent. However, the line emissivities depend
not only on the ion abundances but also on the electron density
and temperature, Ne and Te. The derivation of these parameters
were often based on weaker lines, and this can be a source of
larger uncertainties in the ﬁnal abundances.

Ne was mainly estimated from the line ratios of [O ii] and
[S ii]. These intensities were usually quite precisely measured
(quality ﬂag a in Tables 1–3). Our calculations show that a 10%
uncertainty in these line ratios results in a 30–40% uncertainty
in Ne. Although, the error is quite large, it has a negligible eﬀect
on the ﬁnal ionic abundances, as the resulting uncertainty in the
abundances never exceeds 4%.

Te was calculated from the line ratios of [N ii], [O iii], and
[S iii]. These ratios involve the emission from the (1S −1 D) tran-
sition, which is usually quite faint (quality ﬂag b, at best). Cal-
culations show that a 20% uncertainty in the involved line ratios
results in a 7 – 10% uncertainty in Te. However, this small error

Article number, page 10 of 14

in Te causes much larger errors in the abundances since the line
emissivities depend exponentially on Te. Because of this expo-
nential dependence the error of ionic abundances also depends
on the excitation energy of the transition, in other words, on the
wavelength of the line used to derive the abundance. The shorter
the wavelength, the larger the error. In our case, the ﬁnal uncer-
tainties in the ionic abundances range from 16% for S++, ∼20%
for S+, N+ and Ar++, 28% for O++, up to ∼35% for Ne++ and
O+.

Not every ion of a given element is observable in the wave-
length range covered by our observations. This has to be taken
into account when deriving the abundances of the elements.
The standard way is to apply the so-called ionization correc-
tion factors, usually calculated from steady-state photoionization
models (e.g. Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014). However, it would
be somewhat risky in our case, as it is not clear what the pri-
mary ionization mechanism is operating in the nebular regions
in CK Vul. In Sect. 6.1, we argue that these are shocks rather
than photoionization by the central star. In the case of shocks
the optical emission lines are mainly produced in ambient mat-
ter photoionized by radiation emitted in the hot post-shock re-
gion and/or in matter recombining from the hot, highly ionized
post-shock conditions. Finally, at the observed densities (Ne ≈
500 cm−3) the recombination time is long (∼250 years for H+).
Therefore we can also deal with matter that was ionized in the
past and is now recombining. The state of the latter can be far
from ionization equilibrium conditions. Therefore, we follow a
more general reasoning that allows us to get reliable estimates
of the total elemental abundances, independent of the actual ion-
ization mechanism and history.

The low ﬂux of the He ii 468.6 line assures that the abun-
dance of He++ is negligible in all the investigated regions. In-
deed, our measurements of this line (see Table 4) yield a ratio

Tylenda, Kami´nski, & Mehner: Elemental abundances in CK Vul

He++/H+ (cid:46) 0.005. We thus neglect the He ii 468.6 line while
determining the He abundance. Consequently, the abundance of
helium was derived from the intensities of the He i lines only. We
used He i emissivities of Benjamin et al. (1999). Their formu-
las, besides the recombination cascades, take into account colli-
sional eﬀects. The lines He i 388.9 and 706.5 can be subject to
radiative-transfer eﬀects (see e.g. Ch. 4.6 in Osterbrock & Fer-
land 2006), so we excluded them from our abundance calcula-
tions. The ﬁnal He abundance was obtained as a weighted mean
of values derived from each individual line. The weights were
assigned according to the precision of the original ﬂux measure-
ment. The results are given in Table 5. Uncertainties of the listed
He abundances do not exceed 15%.

The negligible abundance of He++ allows us to assume that
all ions with an ionization potential ≥54.4 eV are practically ab-
sent. This concerns the following (or higher) ions of interest:
N4+, O3+, Ne3+, S5+, and Ar4+. All these ions have recombina-
tion coeﬃcients much larger than that of He++ and very fast rates
of charge transfer with H0 (Kingdon & Ferland 1996). Therefore
if the ionization processes cannot maintain a substantial abun-
dance of He++, they have even more diﬃculties with making the
above ions abundant.

Thus, in the case of oxygen, all the presumably abundant

ions, i.e. O+ and O++, are observed and we assume

O/H = (O+/H+) + (O++/H+).

In the case of nitrogen, only N+ is observed, while N++ and
N3+ can be potentially abundant. In component B, the latter ions
are probably dominant. Therefore we cannot reliably estimate
the N abundance in region B. In component A (and C), the [N ii]
lines are very strong. This suggests that N+ is the dominant ion
of N. This conviction is strengthened by the weakness of [O iii]
lines and consequently the very low abundance of O++ in com-
ponent A. We adopted the following formula

N/H = (N+/H+)(O+/H+)/(O/H)

when determining the N abundance. This is a standard ioniza-
tion correction formula used in the case of photoionized nebu-
lae. In our case of component A, it practically assumes that the
N abundance is equal to the observed abundance of N+. If N++ is
substantially abundant, then we underestimate the N abundance.
Sulfur is the second element, after oxygen, whose two ion-
ization states, i.e. S+ and S++, are observed in CK Vul. However,
contrary to O, we cannot simply assume that these are the only
ions of S that are abundant, as the presence of S3+, or even S4+,
cannot be excluded. This is particularly relevant for component
B where the [S iii] lines are strong and those of [S ii] are not ob-
served. Nevertheless, we adopt

S/H = (S+/H+) + (S++/H+)

as nothing better can be done at this time. We expect this is a
good approximation in component A (and C), as S++ is there at
least an order of magnitude less abundant than S+ and therefore
the abundances of S3+ and S4+ should be negligible. The latter
is not expected in component B and thus our procedure yields
an underestimated abundance of S in region B. This systematic
error has a conﬁrmation in our ﬁnal results for all the regions in
Table 5 where S/H in component B is systematically lower than
that in component A and C. Such discrepancy is not expected
if the relative elemental abundances are constant throughout the
small part of the nebula probed with the X-shooter slit.

Neon and argon are observed only in component B and only
in the form of doubly ionized species. In the case of neon, Ne++

is most probably the dominant ion in component B. Ne+ should
be negligible, because O+ is not observed. Admittedly, Ne+ has a
higher ionization potential than O+ but a very low rate of charge
transfer between Ne++ and H0, compared to that between O++
and H0 (Kingdon & Ferland 1996), should compensate for the
eﬀect caused by the diﬀerence in ionization potentials. There-
fore, we simply assume

Ne/H = Ne++/H+.

In the case of argon, Ar3+ cannot be excluded as an important
ion in component B. Therefore, a determination of Ar abundance
solely from the measured abundance of Ar++, i.e.

Ar/H = Ar++/H+,

leads to an underestimated abundance of this element.

With the elemental abundances obtained for individual re-
gions in Table 5, we derived the mean abundances representing
all the regions. When averaging, the results from regions B2 and
C were weighted twice lower than those from the other regions.
The spectra from these two regions are signiﬁcantly fainter and,
consequently, the measurements of line intensities were less pre-
cise than those in the other regions. As a result, we were unable
to derive reliable estimates of the electron temperature, which
introduced an additional uncertainty in the abundances for these
two regions. When calculating the mean abundance of sulfur,
we omitted the results obtained for component B, because they
probably underestimate the S/H value (see above). The upper
part of Table 6 lists the mean number abundances and their esti-
mated errors. The bottom part of Table 6 presents the same abun-
dances but in mass fractions. For comparison, we also listed the
abundances of the Sun from Asplund et al. (2009).

6. Discussion

6.1. The excitation mechanism of the nebula

There are two possible mechanisms producing nebular line emis-
sion: direct ionization by stellar radiation and excitation by
shock fronts. It is not straightforward to distinguish between
these two mechanisms from observations of line intensities
alone. This is because in the case of shocks, the nebular lines,
especially in the optical, are excited mostly through ionization
by radiation generated in the shock. Both mechanisms are es-
sentially incarnations of photoionization. In the case of CK Vul,

Article number, page 11 of 14

A&A proofs: manuscript no. CKVul_paper_shock

there are however several arguments favoring shocks instead of
photoionization by a hot central star.

signiﬁcant because it appears in all the regions and is correlated
with the excitation and ionization state of the components.

First, we do observe gas moving at high velocities. As can
be seen in Fig. 3, the observed radial velocities range from ∼–
300 to ∼+350 km s−1. The de-projected gas velocities are proba-
bly much higher. Indeed, the large-scale hourglass optical nebula
studied by Hajduk et al. (2013) appears to have a large inclina-
tion of about 65◦ at which the gas moves mainly perpendicular
to the line of sight and the tips of that nebula are estimated to
move as fast as 900 km s−1. Dissipation in shocks with velocities
of a few hundreds of km s−1 can result in gas temperatures above
106 K and produce intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation capa-
ble of photoionizing large volumes of the surrounding medium
(Dopita & Sutherland 1996).

Second, the emission lines of neutral CNO elements (that is,
[C i], [N i], and [O i]) and singly ionized metals ([Fe ii], [Ni ii],
and [Ca ii]) are particularly strong in the spectrum of CK Vul.
This is generally considered as a signature of shock-excited
emission regions (e.g. Dopita & Sutherland 1995). Shocks, con-
trary to photoionizantion by a star, produce extended recombi-
nation regions of a low ionization degree, where hydrogen and
elements having similar ionization potential as hydrogen – such
as N and O – remain largely neutral, while elements of low-
ionization potentials – including, Fe, Ni, and Ca – are predomi-
nantly singly ionized (e.g. Dopita & Sutherland 1996).

Third, we do not observe any signiﬁcant variation of the ion-
ization and excitation conditions with the radial distance from
the position of the presumable central object. Regions A2 and B2
are signiﬁcantly farther away from the location of the central star
than regions A1 and B1, respectively. Yet, comparing regions A1
with A2 and B1 with B2, their spectra (Table 4) as well as the
ionization degrees and temperatures (Table 5) are very similar.
We do, however, observe that the regions at the same (projected)
distance from the central star but at diﬀerent radial velocities, i.e.
A1 and B1 or A2 and B2, have drastically diﬀerent spectra and
ionization states. In the case of photoionization by a star, this
would imply that the star emits drastically diﬀerent spectra in
diﬀerent directions, which is unlikely. The diﬀerences between
components A and B can, however, be easily understood, if they
are powered by shocks. The lower ionization and excitation de-
gree of component A may imply that the matter at negative ra-
dial velocities was shock-excited some time before the matter of
component B (at positive radial velocities). Component A had
thus more time to recombine and cool oﬀ than component B. We
note that at the derived electron densities (∼500 cm−3) the re-
combination time of ionized hydrogen is ∼250 years. Ions, like
O++ and Ne++, recombine much faster than H+.

Another way of explaining the diﬀerences between compo-
nent A and B in terms of shocks is to assume that component
B was excited by a stronger shock than component A. In the
case of low-velocity shocks ((cid:51)s (cid:46) 150 km s−1), the Balmer decre-
ment is steeper than that of the recombination case B (Dopita &
Sutherland 2017). This is because collisional excitation of Hα is
important in an extended region of partial ionization generated
by slow shocks. This seems to be observed in CK Vul, particu-
larly in components A and C. When constraining the excitation
conditions in Sect. 4, we paid attention to reproduce the case B
ratio of Hα to Hβ as this ratio is best determined observationally
and is most sensitive to extinction. The results in Table 4 were
obtained under this assumption. However, for all components in
this table, the Hγ relative line intensity is greater than the value
of ∼47 corresponding to pure recombination. The excess ranges
from ∼6% in component B to ∼20% in component C. Formally,
its magnitude is within the measurement errors but it may be

We therefore made an exercise and derived the extinction
value from Hγ/Hβ. This ratio is supposed to be much less af-
fected by collisional excitation than Hα/Hβ. We obtained C(Hβ)
equal to 0.75 for component C, 1.00–1.08 for component A, and
1.22–1.25 for component B. These values can be compared to
those in Table 4. After correcting the observations using these
new values of extinction, we obtained the relative Hα intensity
ranging from ∼317 for component B, 353–389 for component
A, and 437 for component C. According to Dopita & Suther-
land (2017), these values would correspond to shock velocities
of ∼35 km s−1 for component C, ∼60 km s−1 for component A,
and ∼100 km s−1 for component B. A detailed comparison of
the models of Dopita & Sutherland (2017) with our spectra is
beyond the scope of the present paper. In fact, it would not be
straightforward because of signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the elemen-
tal abundances. Moreover, our measurements probe only a nar-
row cut through the nebular region of CK Vul and probably en-
compass only a part of a shock-excited region. We are unable
to state which particular parts of the shock-excited region were
observed (e.g. a precursor or postshock ﬂow as in Sutherland &
Dopita) whereas such a distinction would be crucial for compar-
ing our line intensities with the models. Nevertheless, the above
estimates on (cid:51)s increase with the increasing excitation of the ob-
served spectra, as expected from the models. For instance, the
models predict signiﬁcant emission in the [O iii] lines only for
(cid:51)s (cid:38) 80 km s−1; that is consistent with the observation of [O iii]
in component B only.

It should, however, be emphasized that the above arguments
in favor of shock excitation are not fully conclusive. Any infor-
mation on the eﬀective temperature or spectral type of the cen-
tral object would be more decisive in this matter. Unfortunately
nothing of this kind can be derived from the observational data
currently available for CK Vul.

6.2. The abundances and nature of CK Vul

The elemental abundances in the nebular region of CK Vul pre-
sented in Table 6 are the primary result of this study. They are
based on the spectra corrected for the extinction derived in a
standard way, i.e. assuming that the true Balmer decrement is
that of the recombination case B. In Sect. 6.1, we discussed
the possibility of excitation by slow shocks, which produce the
Hα/Hβ ratio well above the classical recombination value. Shock
excitation results in extinction values that are signiﬁcantly lower
than those derived assuming the pure recombination decrement.
In order to derive abundances in the framework of slow shocks,
the line intensities should be recalculated with the relevant ex-
tinction.

We therefore repeated the abundance determination using the
extinction values derived from the observed ratio of Hγ/Hβ (see
Sect. 6.1). For component B, the resultant abundances are close
to those in Table 5. Larger diﬀerences are noticeable for compo-
nents A and C. The new abundances are more consistent with
each other than those in Table 5. As a result, the uncertainties of
the ﬁnal averaged abundances, presented in Table 7, are smaller
than those in Table 6.

In Fig. 6, we compare the elemental abundances derived for
classical case B (from Table 6) and in the presence of shocks
(from Table 7). The diﬀerences are insigniﬁcant. Note, however,
that the N/O ratio increases from ∼1.2 in Table 6 (extinction de-
rived from Hα/Hβ) to ∼1.9 in Table 7 (extinction from Hγ/Hβ).

In any case, the abundances we obtained for CK Vul are sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent from the solar values. Helium is overabun-
dant by a factor of two, which implies that ∼25% of hydrogen
in the observed matter has been converted to helium. As a result,
the mass abundance of helium is comparable to that of hydrogen.
Unfortunately, we were not able to derive the carbon abundance,
but the obtained abundances of nitrogen and oxygen show that a
signiﬁcant part of the CNO elements were converted to nitrogen.
This is apparent when comparing the N/O ratio, which is ∼1.2–
1.9 in CK Vul, with the much lower solar value of 0.12. The latter
result conﬁrms the suggestion of Kami´nski et al. (2015a, 2017),
based on submm spectral analysis, that the remnant of CK Vul is
rich in nitrogen. Overall, the current study strongly reinforces the
conclusion drawn from the isotopic study of molecular lines that
the remnant’s material has been processed in H-burning in CNO
cycles. Possible scenarios for this processing were discussed in
Kami´nski et al. (2017) (see also Kami´nski et al. 2018b).

Table 6 also shows that neon, sulfur, and argon are under-
abundant in CK Vul compared to the Sun. The abundances of
these elements are not aﬀected in the CNO cycles. As can also
be seen in Table 6, the summary abundance of oxygen and ni-
trogen in CK Vul is three times lower than in the Sun. The CNO

cycles do not alter the summary abundance of the CNO elements
but mainly convert carbon and oxygen to nitrogen. Therefore,
we may conclude that elements heavier than helium were less
abundant in the matter from which the progenitor of CK Vul was
formed than in the Sun. Using the ζ-scaling of elemental abun-
dances with metallicity of Nicholls et al. (2017)5, for Ne, S and
Ar we ﬁnd [Fe/H]=–0.53±0.07. This low-metallicity chemical
composition strongly suggests that the progenitor of CK Vul was
older than the Sun.

6.3. Extinction

The observed spectrum of CK Vul is signiﬁcantly reddened. This
is mainly due to interstellar extinction but a contribution from
internal dust in CK Vul is not excluded. The observed nebular
region ("jet") is situated inside the northern lobe seen in the sub-
millimeter dust-emission (Kami´nski et al. 2018b; Eyres et al.
2018). Therefore it is likely that part of the observed reddening
is due to local dust situated outside the observed nebular region
but crossed by the line of sight. High interstellar extinction to-
wards CK Vul is expected based on its low Galactic latitude of
1◦ and on observations of interstellar CO lines (Kami´nski et al.
2017).

The values of extinction listed in Table 4 are practically the
same for all the investigated regions, i.e. C(Hβ) (cid:39) 1.36 (EB−V (cid:39)
0.91). This could suggest that there is no signiﬁcant reddening
inside the nebular region itself. However, adopting the hypothe-
sis of slow shocks and determining the extinction from the ob-
served Hγ/Hβ ratio instead of Hα/Hβ (see Sect. 6.1), we derived
extinction values which are lower and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for
diﬀerent regions: that is, C(Hβ) (cid:39) 0.75 for component C, ∼1.04
for component A, and ∼1.24 for component B. We note that
the derived C values correlate with the mean radial velocities of
the regions (see Sect. 4), i.e. –285 km s−1 for component C, ∼–
130 km s−1 for component A, and ∼+75 km s−1 for component B.
The regions of negative radial velocities are expected to be closer
to us than the one moving with the positive velocity. Therefore,
in this case, we would have to conclude that the extinction within
the nebular region is signiﬁcant and that the extinction obtained
for component C, C(Hβ) (cid:39) 0.75, is an upper limit to the inter-
stellar extinction.

7. Summary

We obtained an optical spectrum of the brightest nebular region
of CK Vul, a remnant of an ancient stellar explosions observed in
1670–72. The spectrum was recorded with the X-shooter spec-
trograph at the VLT and reveals a plethora of ionic emission lines
typical for spectra of planetary nebulae. An analysis of the spec-
trum indicates the presence of several spatio-kinematical regions
located ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48). 3–8(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 from the presumed position of the star. From
the measured line intensities, we estimated the electron tempera-
tures, typically of 10–15 kK, and densities of 200–600 cm−3 pre-
vailing in the individual regions. This allows us to derive abun-
dances of the ions emitting the observed lines and also the abun-
dances of several key elements, including H, He, O, and N. De-
spite the diﬀerent excitation conditions within the nebula, the el-
emental abundances derived for individual regions are very sim-
ilar. We found that helium is overabundant by a factor of two
compared to the Sun. Also, nitrogen is overabundant. This is
particularly well seen in the N/O ratio which is ten times higher
than the solar one. These ﬁndings clearly show that the matter

in the remnant of CK Vul has been processed in the CNO cycles
of H-burning. Other elements, such as neon, sulfur, and argon,
are underabundant compared to the Sun. We have found that the
overall abundance of the CNO elements in CK Vul is also lower
than in matter of solar (cosmic) composition. Clearly, the pro-
genitor of CK Vul was an old system, much older than the Sun.
The derived abundances together with other recent observational
results will be discussed in a separate paper devoted entirely to
revealing the nature of CK Vul and its progenitor. Finally, we
argue that the nebular regions in CK Vul are excited by shocks
rather than being directly photoionized by a central star.
