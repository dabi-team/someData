ABSTRACT
We conducted radio-interferometric observations of the well known binary cataclysmic system
AM Herculis. This particular system is formed by the magnetic white dwarf (primary) and
the red dwarf (secondary), and is the prototype of so-called polars. Our observations were
conducted with the European VLBI Network (EVN) in the e-EVN mode at 5 GHz. We
obtained six astrometric measurements spanning one year, which make it possible to update
the annual parallax for this system with the best precision to date (π = 11.29 ± 0.08 mas),
equivalent to the distance of 88.6 ± 0.6 pc. The system was observed mostly in the quiescent
phase (visual magnitude mv ∼ 15.3), when the radio emission was at the level of about 300 µJy.
Our analysis suggests that the radio ﬂux of AM Herculis is modulated with the orbital motion.
Such speciﬁc properties of the radiation can be explained using the emission mechanism
similar to the scenario proposed for V471 Tau and, in general, for RS CVn type stars. In this
scenario the radio emission arises near the surface of the red dwarf, where the global magnetic
ﬁeld strength may reach a few kG. We argue that the quiescent radio emission distinguishes
AM Herculis together with AR Ursae Majoris (the second known persistent radio polar) from
other polars, as the systems with a magnetized secondary star.

INTRODUCTION

Cataclysmic variable stars are a broad class of binary systems that
consist a white dwarf (primary object) and mass transferring sec-
ondary star. The secondary component ﬁlls the Roche sphere and
losses matter via L1 point. Among these objects we may distin-
guish a subclass of magnetic cataclysmic binary systems – called
polars. In polars very strong magnetic ﬁeld of the primary star (10 –
230 MG) prevents from the creation of accretion disks. The matter
transferred from the secondary component must follow along mag-
netic ﬁeld lines, and at the end falls into the magnetic pole/poles of
the primary star. Such mass transfer leads to the formation of strong
shocks nearby the surface of the white dwarf. As a result, the strong
radiation is produced mainly by the bremsstrahlung and the elec-
tron cyclotron maser processes (Melrose & Dulk 1982; Dulk et al.
1983). An irregular variability in polars’ luminosity on timescales
from days to months is one of their main characteristics. As polars
have no accretion disc, the changes in luminosity reﬂect variations
in the mass transfer rate. The origin of the mass transfer rate insta-
bility is probably connected with the local magnetic activity of the
secondary component. When active region on the secondary star

is episodically drifting in the front of the inner Lagrangian point,
the mass transfer is ceased due to the magnetic pressure of a large
star-spot (Livio & Pringle 1994; Kafka & Honeycutt 2005). Alter-
natively, changes in the mass transfer rate could reﬂect variations
in the size of active chromosphere, when the secondary star is not
fulﬁlling the Roche lobe (Howell et al. 2000).

AM Herculis (hereafter AM Her) is one of the most intensively
studied and intriguing magnetic cataclysmic binary system and the
prototype of polars which are also named AM Herculis type stars.
The irregular changes in AM Her brightness of ∆mv (cid:39) 2–3 mag
(high and low states) are observed on timescales from weeks to
months. Tapia (1977) suggested that AM Her contains a compact
star with magnetic ﬁeld of about 200 MG. After this AM Her be-
came a frequent target in many observational campaigns, conducted
at diﬀerent wavelengths (e.g. Szkody 1978; Bunner 1978; Fabbiano
et al. 1981), including also the radio bands (Melrose & Dulk 1982;
Dulk et al. 1983; Bastian et al. 1985). Bailey et al. (1991) using in-
frared cyclotron features, estimated the white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld
strength to be B (cid:39) 14.5 MG, what was in a good agreement with
previous results based on the Zeeman shifts of the photospheric
absorption lines (e.g. Wickramasinghe & Martin 1985). The incli-
nation of the system orbit i (cid:39) 50◦ (Wickramasinghe et al. 1991;

15 GHz (0.24 mJy and 1.14 mJy, respectively). In addition, these
authors also discovered the radio outburst at 4.9 GHz with the max-
imum ﬂux density of 9.7 ± 2.3 mJy, which was 100% RH circularly
polarized. Dulk et al. (1983) also attributed the quiescent emission
to gyrosynchrotron process, caused by mildly relativistic electrons
with energies ∼500 keV, trapped in the magnetosphere of the white
dwarf. The electron-cyclotron maser located nearby the red dwarf,
was proposed as a likely source of the radio outbursts. The same
origin of radio ﬂares was suggested by Melrose & Dulk (1982).

from AAVSO). The epochs of the e-EVN observations presented in this
paper are indicated by arrows.

& Smith 1996; Kafka et al. 2005) were also derived. The white
dwarf mass estimations are in the range between 0.35 – 1.0 M(cid:12)
(e.g. Mouchet 1993; Gänsicke et al. 1998) with preferred value
of Mwd = 0.6 – 0.7 M(cid:12) (Wu et al. 1995; Gänsicke et al. 1995).
The secondary component is believed to be a M4+–M5+ type star
(e.g. Gänsicke et al. 1995; Southwell et al. 1995) with the mass
Ms = 0.20 – 0.26 M(cid:12) (Southwell et al. 1995).

The ﬁrst detection the AM Her radio emission was achieved
using the Very Large Array (VLA) at 4.9 GHz (Chanmugam & Dulk
1982). The measured ﬂux density of AM Her was 0.67 ± 0.05 mJy,
with no evidence of the circular polarization. Dulk et al. (1983) con-
ﬁrmed this detection, obtaining the ﬂux density of 0.55±0.05 mJy
and also specifying the upper limits to the ﬂux density at 1.4 and

Young & Schneider (1979) derived the ﬁrst distance estima-
tion to AM Her d(cid:39)75 pc. Their ﬁnding was based on the analysis of
various M-dwarf features in the optical spectrum. These authors ad-
ditionally suggested, that secondary component in the system must
be a M-dwarf with the spectral type between M4 and M5. In the
next paper Young & Schneider (1981) presented another AM Her
distance estimation (d = 71 ± 18 pc), using the near-infrared CCD
spectra and TiO bands analysis, which also revealed the presence of
M4+ companion. However, there is an indication that the red dwarf
is illuminated by the white dwarf and the spectral type of the sec-
ondary component may be modulated with the orbital phase (Davey
& Smith 1992). Dahn et al. (1982) determined the trigonometric
parallax to 97 stellar systems, including AM Her (d = 108+41
pc).

Gänsicke et al. (1995) used the so-called K-band surface-brightness
method (Bailey 1981; Ramseyer 1994) and calculated the distance
to AM Herculis as 91+18
pc. The most recent distance estimation to

the system of AM Her was made by Thorstensen (2003) with the use

This new value may be crucial for further modelling of physical
processes in this system. The paper is structured as follows. In § 2
we describe observations and the data reduction. In § 3 we present
a new astrometric model of AM Her. In § 4 we discuss observed
AM Her radio properties and the orbital phase dependence of the
radio emission. Finally, in § 5 we summarize our conclusions.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The interferometric observations of AM Her at the 5 GHz band
were carried out in 5 epochs, spread over 12 months from 2012
December 5 to 2013 December 3, using the EVN in the e-VLBI
mode of observations, with use of the phase-referencing technique.
The stations from Eﬀelsberg, Jodrell Bank (MkII), Medicina, Noto,
Onsala, Toruń, Yebes and Westerbork (phased array) participated in
our observations (proposal code EG069). The data were recorded
at the rate 1 Gb/s providing a total bandwidth of 128 MHz, divided
into 8 base-band channels with a bandwidth of 16 MHz each. The
fourth epoch was separated into two parts due to time allocation and
both segments were treated during the reduction of data as separated
epochs. The observation details of the all epochs are summarized
in Tab.1.

Each observational epoch spanned ∼3 hours covering scans
on: AM Her, a bright bandpass calibrator, the phase-reference
source (J1818+5017) and the secondary calibrator (J1809+5007).
During the astrometric calculations we used J1818+5017 posi-
tion taken from Radio Fundamental Catalog2, version rfc 2016d
(RA=18h18m30s.519224, DEC=50◦17(cid:48)19(cid:48)(cid:48).74353, J2000.0).
It
means that we corrected the original position measurements based
on radio maps by -0.13 mas in RA and -0.14 mas in DEC, respec-
tively. These shifts compensate the diﬀerence between J1818+5017
positions in catalogs rfc 2016d and rfc 2012b (rfc 2012b was used
during our observations and the correlation process).

J1809+5007 is a compact radio source selected from the
Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey3 (e.g. Myers et al. 2003) placed
in the proximity of AM Her (GB6J180913+500748, F8.4 GHz =
25.2 mJy). J1809+5007 was observed to examine the phase-
referencing success. The three observed sources are separated on
the sky plane as follows: AM Her & J1818+5017 by 0°.6, AM Her
& J1809+5007 by 1°.2 and J1818+5017 & J1809+5007 by 1°.5 .
The observations were made in 5 minute long cycles, 3.5 minutes
for AM Her or J1809+5007, and 1.5 minute for the phase calibrator.
The main loop of the observations contains ﬁve such cycles. The ﬁrst
cycle dedicated to J1809+5007 was followed by four cycles, which
included integrations on AM Her. It should be mentioned that the
ﬁrst two epochs of the observations overlap with a decrease of the
optical luminosity (blocks A & B). The rest of the measurements
were recorded at the optical low-state of AM Her (blocks D, E &
F). We show the AM Her optical light-curve during the campaign
and the moments of our observations in Fig.1. The visual optical
observations are taken from American Association of Variable Star
Observers4 database.

The whole data reduction process was carried out using stan-
dard NRAO package aips5 procedures (e.g. Greisen 2003). The
maps of the phase calibrator J1818+5017 were created with the

self-calibration in the phase and the amplitude, and used as a model
for ﬁnal fringe-ﬁtting. We applied the imagr task to produce the ﬁnal
total intensity images of all observed sources. During the mapping
process the natural weighting was used. AM Her appears point-like
at the radio maps, but for J1818+5017 we have detected a weak jet,
pointed into east direction on all epochs. J1809+5007 also seems to
be resolved at our maps with a hint of the jet suggestively directed
into north-east.

A sample of radio maps obtained during our observations is
showed on Fig.2. The radio ﬂuxes and astrometric positions of all
observed targets were then measured by ﬁtting Gaussian models, us-
ing the aips task jmfit. In the case of J1809+5007 and J1818+5017,
we estimated only ﬂuxes of the core, since the detailed modelling of
these two sources is beyond the scope of this work. Moreover, these
core ﬂuxes completely dominate over the resolved structures. The
ﬂux variability was tracked using the task dftpl with an averaging
interval equal to the length of scans. Before application of the dftpl
task, we searched the area within the radius of 3(cid:48)(cid:48) around target’s
position for background sources and none was found. In a case of
the background object detection, its model should be removed from
uv-data, before radio ﬂux estimation with dftpl.

In order to expand the time span of the observations and to
improve the proper motion estimation, we added two archival VLA
observations at 8.4 GHz, made in BnA conﬁguration (1988 Jan 10
and 2003 Oct 17, observational codes AC206 and AM783). The
VLA observations were reduced with the aips package. Sources
J1808+4542 and J1800+7828 were used as phase calibrators dur-
ing AM783 and AC206, respectively. All positions collected in this
paper are presented in Tab.2. The used VLA observations where
short scans and the distant phase calibrators were used. Under the
typical conditions of VLA observations, the astrometry accuracy of
∼10 % of the restoring beam could be achieved (∼0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 for AC206
and AM783). In the archival observations, the conditions are worse
than during the standard observation, hence we made a crude esti-
mation of the systematic error 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)12 for VLA astrometry. It should
be noted that VLA calibrators positions used during observations
are taken from the diﬀerent catalogs. This results in additional sys-
tematic eﬀects in astrometry, which in general should be taken into
account during calculations as calibrators position are relevant to
the diﬀerent global astrometric solutions. However, this eﬀect is at
the level of ∼ 1 mas (the typical discrepancy between a given source
position in diﬀerent catalogs are sub-mas), and hence negligible in
comparison to assumed by us systematic errors for VLA position
measurements.

3 ASTROMETRIC MODEL AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE

ABSOLUTE PARALLAX

Given the e-EVN measurements in the geocentric frame, we deter-
mine the parallax and the components of the proper motion through
a canonical 5-element model for the ICRS astrometric place of an
isolated target:

(1)

(cid:174)r(ti) = (cid:174)r(t0) + (cid:174)m(ti − t0) − π (cid:174)EB(ti),
where (cid:174)r(ti) is the geocentric position of the target at epoch ti, relative
to the position vector (cid:174)r(t0) in a reference epoch t0, (cid:174)m is the space
motion vector, (cid:174)EB(ti) is the barycentric position of the Earth at the
observational epoch and π is the parallax of the radiation source. We
note that due to a proximity of the phase-calibrators and the target,
we skip local, diﬀerential perturbations, for instance due to the light
deﬂection. We compute components of the vector mean motion

collected during the third epoch of the observations (EG069D). The successive contours show an increase of the ﬂux density by a factor of 2, where the ﬁrst

The vector model in Eq. 1 may be parametrized through the
target’s ICRF coordinates (α0, δ0) at the initial epoch t0, components
(µα, µδ) of the proper motion at the epoch t0, and the parallax
factors (πα, πδ) projected onto the ICRF coordinates axes. To avoid
correlations between the zero-epoch position and the proper motion

components, we calculate the reference epoch t0

ephemeris JPL DE405 (Folkner et al. 2014).

We optimized the astrometric model with the same approach
as presented in Gawroński et al. (2017). Uncertainties of the model
parameters ξξξ = (α0, δ0, µα, µδ, π) depend on complex way on the
residual phase in phase-referencing, sub-mas changes of the phase
calibrator radio structures and the atmospheric zenith delay residu-
als. To account for such factors, the formal uncertainties are rescaled
in quadrature, σ2
, where σf is the so called error ﬂoor
added as an additional free parameter to be optimized. To do so,
we deﬁne the maximum likelihood function L. For normally dis-
tributed uncertainties σi, we account for the error ﬂoor σf , deﬁning
L as follows

where M is the total number of α(ti) and δ(ti) measurements. It
makes it possible to determine the error ﬂoor σf in a self-consisted
manner.

We analyse the log L function in terms of the Bayesian in-
ference. We sample the posterior probability distribution P(ξξξ |D)
of astrometric model parameters ξξξ in Eq. 1. Given the data set D
of astrometric observations data-set (understood as αi and δi com-
ponents): P(ξξξ |D) ∝ P(ξξξ) P(D |ξξξ), where P(ξξξ) is the prior, and
the sampling data distribution P(D|ξξξ) ≡ log L(ξξξ, D). For all pa-
rameters, we deﬁne noninformative priors by constraining the model
parameters, i.e., α0 > 0 hr, δ0 > 0 deg, µ∗
α, µδ ∈ [−1000, 1000] mas
yr−1, π > 0 mas and σf > 0 mas.

We used the emcee package developed by Foreman-Mackey
et al. (2013) to perform the posterior sampling with the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. In all experiments, we
increased the MCMC chain lengths to up to 72,000 samples and
2240 random “walkers” selected initially in a small radius hyperball
around a preliminary astrometric solution found with the simplex
algorithm. The MCMC acceptance ratio was near 0.5 in all cases.
We performed a few ﬁtting experiments for three sets of mea-
surements (see Table 2). The ﬁrst set comprises of all six EVN
detections. The second set contains all EVN and VLA epochs. The
third set comprises of a minimal number of four EVN epochs that
make it possible to determine the absolute parallax. We optimized
the 5-element model with and without the error ﬂoor. For the EVN
data, we computed the astrometric parameters at the GAIA DR1
epoch JD 2457023.5, to have a direct link to the forthcoming GAIA
catalogue (Lindegren et al. 2016).

The derived astrometric parameters for diﬀerent data sets and
epochs are displayed in Table 3. Since the MCMC posteriors look
similar for all datasets, we illustrate only the astrometric model
for six EVN epochs (see Tab. 2 and the left column in Table 3).
The results are illustrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 as one– and two–
dimensional projections of the posterior probability distributions
for astrometric model with and without accounting for the error
ﬂoor correction, respectively. It may be compared with the posterior
derived for a model with the error ﬂoor included (Fig. 4). The error
ﬂoor parameter is in fact redundant for the AM Her e-EVN data,
since its posterior probability has a maximum at σf = 0 mas, it is
small and almost “ﬂat” elsewhere with a median around 0.15 mas.
Indeed, the 5-parameter astrometric model yields χ2 ∼ 1, and
including the additional parameter does not improve the astrometric
ﬁt.

Astrometric campaign of AM Her with e-EVN

5

In the best-ﬁtting solution for all e-EVN data in Table 2, the
AM Her parallax π = 11.29 ± 0.08 mas, which is equivalent to the
distance of d = 88.6 ± 0.6 pc. This is formally the most accurate
and absolute determination of the AM Her distance, as compared to
previous estimates in (e.g. Gänsicke et al. 1995; Thorstensen 2003).
This new estimate roughly agrees with the most recent determina-
tion based on the optical observations (d = 79+8
pc; Thorstensen
−6
2003), yet our uncertainty is one order of magnitude smaller.

The top panel of Fig. 5 illustrates the synthetic paralactic mo-
tion of the target over-plotted with the original measurements as blue
(grey-white) ﬁlled circles. In this scale the error-bars are smaller
than the circle diameter. To best ﬁtting model (red/dark grey curve)
is over-plotted on 100 randomly sampled models from the posterior
data (Fig. 3) for the time interval ±465 days w.r.t the ﬁrst and last
data epochs, respectively.

We also compared the inferred model positions with AM Her
radio maps from our campaign, and in all cases they agree well.
The residuals to the ﬁnal astrometric model based on the EVN
observations in Tab. 2 are illustrated in Fig. 6. Curiously, there is
some systematic trend of the residuals apparent, however a sparse
sampling makes it hardly possible to interpret the pattern of the
residuals. Given the small error ﬂoor parameter, it has unlikely
systematic meaning.

Given that the EVN observations are very expensive in terms
of the human power and telescope time, we did also a simple ex-
periment for estimating a minimal number of observations required
to reliably determine the parallax of relatively distant, AM Her-like
targets. We assume that observations with sub-mas level uncertain-
ties are scheduled to cover the whole year time-window. We found
that three observations are not suﬃcient to determine the parallax.
With six (α, δ) datums, the astrometric model in Eq. 1 is closed, but
we could not ﬁnd any reliable solution using the MCMC optimiza-
tion procedure. With four observations, the results are very similar
to the parameters obtained for the whole EVN data set, both in terms
of the numerical values (Table 3) and the posterior distribution.

Finally, we extended our e-EVN measurements with two
archival VLA observations from the NRAO database6. The VLA
data, back to 1988 and 2003, could improve the determination of
the proper motion. For the same reason, we could use optical mea-
surements in Thorstensen (2003), however, they are not available
in source form and the reference paper reports large uncertain-
ties ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). We also found an infra-red position from the 2MASS
catalogue (Skrutskie et al. 2006), which has similarly substantial
uncertainty of ∼ 80 mas.

We added the VLA measurements aiming to improve the mean
motion parameters, since the EVN data cover only one year. Unfor-
tunately, the uncertainties are much larger for this set than for the
e-EVN data, and the VLA measurements stand out from the model
(the bottom panel in Fig. 5). Yet the spread of models randomly
selected from the posterior, is quite limited for almost three decades
interval. We found that the posterior distribution looks like the same
as for the EVN data. We did not ﬁnd any improvement of the mean
motion parameters too, see Table 3.

in units of 1011 cm and ν is the frequency of the observations in units
of GHz. We calculated the maximum size of the emitting region r11,
using estimated minimum resolvable size θm of an interferometer

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2018)

AM Her appears unresolved on all our maps with SNR detections in
the range ∼ 7 – 20. This implies that the minimum resolvable size is
equal to the upper size of the emission region, and hence the lower
limit of Tb could be estimated. Our observations give r11=21.7 –
36.4 (0.15 – 0.25 au), what translates to Tb (cid:38) 0.4 –2.4 ×106 K. A
VLBI detection with a brightness temperature above 106 K is usu-
ally interpreted as a signature of non-thermal radiation, however
value ∼ 106 K do not exclude the thermal emission. Therefore, this
particular estimation is ambiguous. On the other hand, the ther-
mal radiation may come only from relatively large emission zone
(cid:38) 30 rorb (Tb (cid:46) 106 K), where rorb (cid:39) 0.005 au is the radius of the
AM Her orbit. This radius was calculated under assumptions that the
mass of the primary component is MWD (cid:39) 0.7 M(cid:12), the secondary
star mass is MRD (cid:39) 0.3 M(cid:12), and the orbital period is Porb = 3.1 hr.
The values of the parameters listed above agree with the literature
data (e.g. Gänsicke et al. 2006). Such a large emission region could
be considered in the case of the thermal bremsstrahlung in a stel-
lar wind. However, using the wind analysis of Wright & Barlow

1982). The high value for VLA measurement during the low optical
state (15 min integration f8.4 GHz (cid:39) 0.63 mJy, mV (cid:39) 15.1, Mason
& Gray 2007) is most likely due to radio ﬂare, as during the next 15
min integration, the detected ﬂux was f8.4 GHz (cid:39) 0.37 mJy. To test a
signiﬁcance of a possible correlation we calculated the Pearson cor-
relation coeﬃcient for available data. We removed the probable ﬂare
presented in Mason & Gray (2007) from our sample and took only
detections into account. The derived correlation coeﬃcient σ = 0.62
represents moderate correlation, where p-value = 0.03 is a strong in-
dication that the relationship is real. When the non-detections from
Bastian et al. (1985) are added with the upper limits, we obtained
σ = 0.45 and p-value = 0.11. The p-value indicates that we cannot
reject the hypothesis that both discussed AM Her physical proper-
ties are unrelated. However, this is a small sample statistic and more
data is required to make any decisive statements on this issue.

The noted diﬀerence between the archival data and the new
EVN measurements of the quiescent emission can be explained
in two ways. First, we consider the extended, diﬀused component
of the AM Her radio emission, that could be resolved on VLBI
scales. However, it is diﬃcult to point out its origin. This may be a
strong stellar wind from the system, but this hypothesis again needs
very high mass loss rate. It also could be due to a slow expanding
and decelerating shell, after the nova outburst (e.g. RS Oph, Eyres
et al. 2009), although it requires quite a recent (∼ 1– 10 years ago)
thermonuclear runaway event in AM Her. It is clearly not the case,
since from the distance about of ∼ 88 pc and with a typical absolute
magnitude of − 8m during the maximum (della Valle & Livio 1995),
the visual optical brightness of the AM Her nova at the maximum
should be m max∼ −3m. This would be hardly possible to overlook
nowadays.

Alternative scenario assumes that there is a correlation between
the quiescent radio luminosity and the activity level of AM Her.
Dulk et al. (1983) proposed, that the quiescent emission emerges
through the gyrosynchrotron process caused by mildly relativistic
(E∼ 500 keV) electrons, which are located in the magnetosphere
of the primary star. Such a correlation implies that the accretion
stream provides at least partially electrons responsible for the gy-
rosynchrotron emission, even during very low rates of the accretion.
The relationship may not be a strong one, as other eﬀects (e.g. local
magnetic activity of the secondary star) also could have impact on
the quiescent emission. We prefer this scheme from two presented,
because the ﬁrst one generates additional problems.

Due to the quality of the e-EVN observations we were able
to track evolution of the AM Her radio ﬂux from short (∼ 5 min)
to long (∼ months) timescales. In order to check the reliability of
AM Her ﬂux measurements we obtained ﬂuxes for the phase cali-
brator J1818+5017 and the secondary calibrator J1809+5007. The
ﬂuxes for AM Her and J1809+5007 are presented on Fig.8. The
scatter of J1809+5007 ﬂux from individual scans is within ∼ 10 %
around the mean value, and in case of J1818+5017 in ∼ 5 % around
the mean with a few rare outliers. We also compared ﬂuxes based
on the upper and the lower half of the frequency band and these
agree within the error with a few points with noticeable deviation.
It gives us the conﬁdence that measured AM Her ﬂuxes are valid.

We did not detect any short-time radio outbursts, which were
previously reported by Dulk et al. (1983). We observed only ﬂux
variations around an average value, which may reﬂect short-time
changes of AM Her radio luminosity. We also checked if the radio
emission is modulated with the orbital period. The phase-resolved
light curve is showed on Fig.9. We used AM Her orbital ephemerids
taken from Kafka et al. (2005) for the calculations. Two minima are
visible in the phased radio ﬂux, a sharp one around φ ∼ 0.1, and a

posterior, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Note that in all cases the synthetic curves

respectively.

(1975), we estimate that the observed ﬂux values could be achieved
only for unrealistically high mass loss rates, i.e. for a slow wind
(cid:219)M ∼ 3 × 10−8 M(cid:12),
(cid:51)w = 400 km/s, required mass loss rate is
and for a fast wind (cid:51)w = 1500 km/s, required mass loss rate is
(cid:219)M ∼ 1 × 10−7 M(cid:12). Therefore, it is unlikely that observed AM Her
radio emission has thermal origin, what is in agreement with previ-
ous conclusions (e.g. Dulk et al. 1983; Mason & Gray 2007).

Curiously, the radio ﬂuxes measured during our campaign
(180 − 370 µJy) appear to be lower than those reported in the litera-
ture (so far). Moreover, our all observational epochs took place dur-
ing the decreasing and the low state of the AM Her optical activity.
This observational result suggests that the AM Her radio luminosity
may be correlated with the mass transfer rate, which reﬂects in high
and low states of the optical and the X-ray activity (e.g. de Martino
et al. 2002). In order to study a possible correlation between the
optical and the radio activity of AM Her, we collected all ﬂux mea-
surements at 5 & 8 GHz available in the literature, and compared
them with the optical observations from AAVSO archive (Fig.7).
We selected these particular radio bands, because the AM Her radio
spectrum appears ﬂat at these frequencies (Chanmugam & Dulk

than the physical size of the binary. The new e-EVN data suggest
that there is a correlation between the observed radio ﬂux and the
AM Her orbital phase. Moreover, the radio light curve is similar to
observed in V471 Tau (Nicholls & Storey 1999), a pre-CV eclips-
ing binary with orbital period 12.51 hr . Nicholls & Storey (1999)
proposed that the emission mechanism similar to RS CVn binary
systems could explain observed radio properties of V471 Tau, where
the gyrosynchrotron emission originates from ∼ 400 keV electrons
near the surface of the secondary component. This model assumes
that electrons are accelerated to mildly relativistic energies, in the
region where the magnetic ﬁelds of both stars are reconnecting. The
accelerated electrons trapped in the K dwarf’s magnetosphere are re-
sponsible for the radio emission. This interaction of ﬁelds is caused
by a diﬀerential rotation of both components in V471 Tau. The radio
emission arises in a wedge-like magnetic structures, which connects
the acceleration region with the photosphere of the secondary com-
ponent (see for details Nicholls & Storey 1999). It should be noted
that the observed V471 Tau ﬂux variations are much more promi-
nent in comparison to AM Her. This could be just a pure geometrical
eﬀect, as in V471 Tau there is an eclipse of the radio emitting re-
gion by the K1V secondary photosphere. As the AM Her orbital
inclination is relatively high (i (cid:39) 50◦, e.g. Davey & Smith 1996)
the probable dependency between radio ﬂux and the orbital phase
likely arises only due to diﬀerent orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld
structures in AM Her and the line of sight. If this model is valid
in the case of AM Her, one important condition should be met, the
secondary red dwarf should have strong (∼ kG) large scale magnetic
ﬁeld.

Recently, Williams et al. (2015) showed that the well-studied
M9 type dwarf TVLM 513âĂŞ46546 hosts a stable, dipole magnetic
ﬁeld of about 3 kG at the surface. Therefore, it is plausible to assume
that other low-mass red dwarfs are also able to create such strong
magnetic ﬁelds. The ﬂaring and the spectroscopic activity of the
red dwarf observed during the low states of AM Her (Kafka et al.
2005, 2006) supports the idea of the strong magnetic ﬁelds on the
red dwarf surface, because the ﬂaring is a sign post of the magnetic
and star-spot activity. Kafka et al. (2006) also concluded that the
observed spectroscopic variations in Hα proﬁles are consistent with
motions in large loop magnetic coronal structures on the secondary
star.

wider one with the local minimum at φ ∼ 0.6. We checked reliability
of the phased radio light curve and repeated measurements for the
upper and the lower half of the used radio band. In all cases the
both mentioned minima were visible and located at the same orbital
phase. This is a strong indication that the noted dependency between
the orbital phase and the quiescent radio luminosity is real, however
new more sensitive observations are needed to support this ﬁnding.
We also investigated if presented pattern in the phase-resolved light
curve could arise from a sample of random data. We calculated
reduced χ2 for the binned data relative to the mean based on all
individual measurements, which gives χ2 (cid:39) 2.6. Next we derived
χ2 for 10000 iterations for binned data with randomized time for
each single measurement. We found that a random set of data may
give χ2 > 2.5, with the probability that is less than 1%. We conclude
it is unlikely that the observed light curve could be a result of
accidental measurements.

This observational result contradicts the proposed by Dulk
et al. (1983) explanation of AM Her quiescent radio emission. The
model assumes that the emission region is comparable or larger

observations (• represents J1809+5007 and represents AM Her, respectively) . The error bars are of length ±1σ.

However, the synchronous rotation of AM Her components
causes problems for V471 Tau model and the process of electron
acceleration should be diﬀerent in AM Her. We postulate that the
acceleration may originate from the interaction between red dwarf
local magnetic ﬁelds frozen into transferred plasma and the white
dwarf magnetosphere. The magnetic reconnection takes place near
the L1 point, where the plasma accumulates during the accretion. As
the local magnetic activity is very variable in the case of active red
dwarfs, it may naturally explain observed variations in the quiescent
radio ﬂux in short and long timescales. This is also in agreement
with the observed probable correlation between the radio luminosity
and the high and low states of AM Her activity, when during the
increased mass-transfer rate the electron reservoir is simply much
larger (∼ 3 × 10−11 M(cid:12) yr−1 during high state and at least one
order of magnitude lower during low state, de Martino et al. 1998).
Observed variations in the quiescent radio ﬂux on timescales of
minutes/hours may be also interpret as changes in the mass transfer
rate. Such rapid changes in the accretion are observed in the optical

and X-ray domain (e.g. de Martino et al. 1998; Bonnet-Bidaud et al.
2000)

Mason & Gray (2007) discovered a second persisted radio
polar AR Ursae Majoris (AR UMa), which has diﬀerent physical
properties than AM Her. AR UMa is a binary system with the orbital
period 1.93 hr (Remillard et al. 1994). The primary white dwarf
in this system has the magnetic ﬁeld strength of about 230 MG
(Schmidt et al. 1996), and its mass is in the range 0.91 − 1.24 M(cid:12)
(Bai et al. 2016). Harrison et al. (2005) using infrared spectroscopy,
estimated the spectral type of the AR UMa secondary red dwarf
(M5.5 V). Mason & Gray (2007) also noted that AR UMa phased
radio light curve at 8.4 GHz suggests a minimum near the orbital
phase φ ∼ 0. If we assume that the source of the quiescent radio
emission is the same in both polars, it leads to a conclusion that the
emission does not depend on the physical properties of the primary
white dwarf. Our ﬁndings support Mason & Gray (2007) statement,
where the authors postulate that the quiescent radio emission is
a sign-post of a magnetized secondary star and this distinguish
AM Her and AR UMa from other polars, where no such emission

light on this puzzle.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We report our results from the recently conducted e-EVN astro-
metric campaign at 6 cm of AM Her. These observations were
conducted in years 2012 – 2013. AM Her was detected on all six
scheduled observational epochs with the quiescent radio ﬂux in the
range 0.18 – 0.37 mJy. We calculated a new AM Her astrometric
model, and we determined an improved annual, absolute parallax
of π = 11.29 ± 0.08 mas with the uncertainty one order of magni-
tude less than in the literature. It places the AM Her almost 10 pc
≡ 10% farther than predicts the most recent estimate by Thorstensen
(2003). The sub-mas accuracy of the derived astrometric positions
may be similar to the outcome expected from the GAIA mission,
and our results could be used as an independent technique for the
GAIA measurements. We demonstrated that the e-EVN makes it
possible to measure the AM Her parallax with only four epochs
during one year interval, still providing very low uncertainty.

We found observational evidence that the AM Her radio ﬂux is
likely modulated with the orbital phase and its behavior resembles
the radio light curve noticed in V471 Tau. This behavior could be
explained when the origin of AM Her radio emission is similar to
proposed for V471 Tau and generally for RS CVn. We also postulate
that the quiescent radio emission distinguish AM Her and AR UMa
from other polars, as systems with magnetized red dwarfs. We also
proposed that the correlation between the quiescent radio luminos-
ity and the mass transfer rates (high and low states of activity) could
explain noted diﬀerence between the AM Her ﬂux based on our new
EVN observations and the archival data. This may indicate that the
accretion stream provides electrons, which are further accelerated
and produce photons in the gyrosynchrotron process, but new sen-
sitive radio observations of AM Her during high state and AR UMa
in both activity states are needed to validate this hypothesis.
