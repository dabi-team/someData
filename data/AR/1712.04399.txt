The concept of the LAr TPC technology that is an excellent tracking - calorimeter detector will be used 
for the next generations of neutrino experiments. In this class of detectors both the scintillation light emitted and 
the charge produced by the ionization are used to detect and identify the characteristics of the primary particle. 
The reduction of the radioactive background, the knowledge of the sources and mechanisms of its production as 
well as the characteristics of the signals have as consequence the increase of the sensitivity of huge detectors and 
the  capability  to  discriminate  between  various  particles  interacting  with  the  detector.  Cosmogenic  sources  of 
background or activation of different materials become more important in this context. The radioactivity induced 
by cosmogenic reactions in Ar is discussed by considering muon capture and reactions induced by neutrons as 
sources  of  background.  The  simulated  cross  sections  for  the  considered  nuclear  reactions  are  obtained  using 
TALYS  and  EMPIRE  codes,  highlighting  the  similarities  and  differences  between  the  results  of  these  nuclear 
codes and the level of concordance with the few existing experimental data. 

Key words: cosmogenic radioactivity, Ar, negative muon capture, neutron reactions. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

The  good  knowledge  of  the  radioactive  background  and  the  search  for  materials  that  produce 
lower  values  for  it  is  an  important  requirement  for  rare  event  experiments.  Cosmogenic  sources  of 
background or activation of different materials in a detector system become more important with the 
increase of sensitivity of experiments and thus a good knowledge of unwanted processes is necessary. 
The  main  sources  of  background  are:  i)  environmental  radioactivity  including  geo-radioactivity, 
cosmic rays and their secondaries; ii) intrinsic radioactivity as radio impurities in the components of 
the  detector  and  radio  impurities  in  the  shield  materials;  iii)  activation  of  detector  materials  during 
exposure to radiation ‚Äì in this class (Œ±, n) reactions, neutrons from fission, as well as reactions induced 
by muons and neutrons.  

Some  comments  about  these  sources  of  background  must  be  done.  The  flux  of  high-energy 
muons induced by cosmic ray interactions decreases as depth increases while the angular dependence 
is  due  to  the  surface  profile.  Cosmic-ray  muons  themselves  can  be  easily  detected  and  vetoed,  but 
muon  induced  spallation  backgrounds,  especially  fast  neutrons  and  long  lifetime  isotopes,  are 
extremely  dangerous  for  low  background  counting  experiments.  At  low  energies,  neutrons  are 
generated by Œ± particles and fission processes of Uranium and Thorium in the rocks - this component 
depends  on  the  site  but  is  independent  on  depth.  The  muons  could  penetrate  deep  rocks  and  could 
produce  capture  reactions  and  this  contribution  is  related  to  the  site  depth.  Radioactive  radon 
concentration in the air depends on local geology, but increases in closed halls. This can only be tuned 
by  proper  ventilation.  Cosmogenic  processes,  the  detector  itself,  concrete  around  the  detector, 
supports, shielding, electrical connections, etc. may produce radioactive nuclides and thus contribute 
to the radioactive background. 

In  the  last  period  both  signals  produced  in  the  bulk  of  Ar  detector,  i.e.  the  scintillation  light

emitted in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and the charge produced by the ionization are separately or 
simultaneously  used  to  detect  and  identify  the  characteristics  of  the  primary  particle.  Huge  Ar 
detectors  must  have  high  sensitivity  and  the  capability  to  discriminate  between  various  particles 
interacting with the detector for efficient background reduction. 

One of the next generations of  neutrino experiments is based on the concept of the LAr Time 
Projection  Chamber  technology  that  is  an  excellent  tracking  -  calorimeter  detector.  The  pioneering 
work started with the successive prototypes for ICARUS (single phase technology): 0.003, 0.05, 3, 10 
and  478  tons  (T600)  on  surface  and  eventually  to  its  underground  commissioning.  The  alternative 
technology  ‚Äì  the  double phase  Large  Electron  Multiplier (LEM)  readout  with charge  extraction  and 
amplification coupled to a very long drift path is in progress, small demonstrator is now operational, 
the  prototype  is  in  construction  (with  a  volume  ‚âà  530  m3  liquid  argon  and  ‚âà  70  m3  gas)  and  final 
GLACIER design (20-100 kt) is technically feasible to be built [1].  

Although external background from cosmic rays, i.e. hadronic components, is suppressed in the 
conditions of operating underground at high depth, muons with low and very low energies can survive 
the shielding of rocks and escape the trigger systems, or are generated by neutrinos and represent the 
ideal  particles  for  capture  processes  in  different  materials,  in  particular  in  Ar.  Also,  the  very  high 
energy component of the flux of muons penetrating the shielding of rocks up to underground induces 
spallation reactions and thus activation of elements can be produced. 

The neutrons  existing  in  underground laboratories  are  those  from  astrophysical  sources,  those 
produced by reactions induced by atmospheric or solar neutrinos or those generated by cosmic muons 
that  have  penetrated  so  far.  Neutrons  and  muons  as  well  as  atmospheric  or  solar  neutrinos,  geo-
neutrinos, neutrinos from reactors are the major sources of external radioactive background, depending 
on the experimental configurations and materials used in walls, shielding, but also on the composition 
of the huge underground detector. Accidentally neutrinos from supernovae or other sources could be 
important. 

In its turn, the scintillation  signal is influenced by the  radioactive background. As an incident 
particle will produce both singlets and triplet dimers, the scintillation is a product of the two radiative 
decays.  The  singlet  decays  quickly,  being  responsible  for  most  of  the  prompt  light  seen  in  the 
scintillation  spectrum,  whereas  the  triplet  decays  with  a  longer  lifetime.  The  time  constant  of  the 
singlet and triplet decays have been measured in all phases. For the present case the singlet lifetime 
and  the  triplet  lifetime,  both  in  ns  are:  7.0  ¬±  1.0  and  1600  ¬±  100  respectively  [2].  The  results  of  a 
spectroscopic study on liquid and gasous Ar [3] put in evidence the differences in the emission spectra 
as well as those due to the contributions of different impurities [4]. The LAr spectrum is dominated by 
an emission feature (126.8 nm) analogue to the 2nd excimer continuum in the gas phase, confirming 
the previous results of Doke [5]. Weak-emission features in the wavelength range from 145 to 300 nm 
can be observed. The structure at 155 nm in the gas phase has only a very weak analogue in the liquid 
phase. The structure at longer wavelengths up to 320 nm is addressed as the 3rd continuum emission 
in the gas phase. The scintillation yield of Ar for electron excitation is 40000 photons/MeV [6]. The 
presence of radioactive isotopes in  Ar or other radioactive isotopes increases the number of photons 
emitted by scintillations. In addition, the impurities present in Ar (intrinsic or produced by cosmogenic 
processes)  present  particular  emission  features  at  specific  wavelengths  and  must  be  investigated  to 
improve particle discrimination capabilities of LAr detectors [3]. Usually wavelength shifters normally 
convert  the  VUV  scintillation  photons  into  ultraviolet  (UV)  or  visible  light  where  comparatively 
inexpensive photomultipliers can be used for light detection. All the spectral information which may 
be very important for particle identification is lost with this technique.  

In  this  short  contribution,  details  of  the  muon  capture  in  40Ar  are  discussed  and  the  cross 
sections  for  possible  production  of  radioactive  isotopes  by  neutron  activation  are  simulated  using 
nuclear codes TALYS and EMPIRE.  

2. Negative muon capture in 40Ar 

Usually the energy loss of muons is parameterised in the form [7]:

The critical energy is defined as Œµ¬µ = Œ±/Œ≤. Here the thickness of the crossed material is measured 
in g/cm2. For standard rock, the typical values for the factors Œ± and Œ≤ are Œ± ÔÅÄ 2 MeV g-1cm2 and Œ≤ ÔÅÄ 
4x10‚Äì6 g‚Äì1cm2. If the muon with initial energy 
 penetrates a depth h, the average energy of a beam 
of muons is: 

and the minimum energy of a muon at the surface, necessary to penetrate the depth h and obtaining the 
= ùúÄùúá((ùúÄùúá)ùõΩ‚Ñé ‚àí 1).  In  fact,  this  condition  favours  the  nuclear

Analytical  equations  for  the  stopping  rate  of  negative  muons  as  well  as  production  rate  of 
radionuclides  in  capture  processes  can  be  found  in  Ref.  [8].  For  Ar  the  total  capture rate  is  (1.20 ¬± 
0.08)  x  106  s‚Äì  1  [9].  In  this  particular  case,  the  primary  product  is  an  excited  state  of  either  Cl  or  S 
nuclei, with energy from zero up to about 100 MeV [10]. If the excitation energy is below 6 MeV, this 
state de-excites electromagnetically, otherwise by nucleon emission. The results for nucleon emission 
are presented in Table 1.

With a yield more than 67.31% per stopped muon, free neutrons are produced in the bulk of 

Ar and could initiate new reactions. 

From the analysis of reaction products from different channels, it is clear that the  39Ar isotope 
appears with the highest direct yield from  39Cl disintegration and from subsequent disintegrations of 
39S (49.23¬±1.62 yield/stopped muon). With a half life of T1/2 =269 y and maximum beta decay energy 
of  0.565 MeV, the isotope  39Ar induce unwanted  permanent background in  scintillation  and charge 
signals.  Usually  atmospheric  Ar  contains  the  radioactive  39Ar  with  a  measured  ratio  39Ar/40Ar  ÔÅÄÔÄ†

ratio. The isotope 

can be extracted from 40Ar by isotopic separation.  

3. Cosmogenic reactions induced by neutrons in 40Ar 

For  the  neutron  spectrum,  some  parameterizations  exist  at  sea  level  [13,  14].  For  the 
underground  case,  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  the  transmitted  flux,  but  also  the  component  due  to  the 
process (¬µ,n) following the prescriptions of different authors or by simulating the interactions in the 
materials penetrated by muons. The production of fast neutrons from cosmic-ray muons was predicted 
by different authors, for example by Wang et al. [15] or Boehm et al. [16].  Malgin and co-workers 
investigated  in  a  series  of  publications,  see  [17,  18,  19],  the  phenomenology  of  the  muon  induced 
neutron yield and thus neutron induced rate, obtaining an universal but empiric parameterization. In 
the general case, for a muon with the an energy ùê∏ùúá, the neutron yield in a material with mass number A 
is:  

ùëåùúá(ùê¥, ùê∏ùúá) =

ùëÅùê¥
ùê¥

‚å©ùúéùúáùê¥ùõøùëõ‚å™  

where ùëÅùê¥ is Avogadro‚Äôs number, ‚å©ùúéùúáùê¥ùõøùëõ‚å™ is a mean value of the product of a ¬µA-interaction cross-
section and neutron multiplicity, ùõøùëõ. In this equation, neutron yield is measured in (n/¬µ/(g/cm2)). For 
the  muon  energy  range  between  about  40  GeV  up  to  ‚àº  400  GeV,  authors  obtained  an  universal 
empirical formula for the muon induced neutron yield: 

ùëåùëõ=ùõæùê∏ùúá[GeV]ùúÄ1ùê¥ùúÄ2  

Here the constants have the following values:  Œ≥= 4.4√ó10‚àí7 cm2/g, ùúÄ1= 0.78, ùúÄ2= 0.95. 

Another approach is represented by the Monte Carlo MUSIC and MUSUN simulation codes 
for muon transport through matter [20, 21] and this code is an usual instrument to estimate the rate to 
neutron production from muons in the underground. 

Atmospheric neutrinos represent another source of background because they can interact with 
the detector producing muons and hadrons. Rein and Sehgal [22] describe the probable reactions with 
a single pion in the final state, muon and strange particles, in the resonance region up to W = 2 GeV  

ùúêùúá + ùëù ‚Üí ùúá‚àí + ùúã+ + ùëù 
ùúêùúá + ùëù ‚Üí ùúá‚àí + ùêæ+ + ùëù 
ùúêùúá + ùëõ ‚Üí ùúá‚àí + ùêæ+ + Œõ 
ùúêùúá + ùëõ ‚Üí ùúá‚àí + ùêæ+ + Œõ + ùúã0 

What is important to mention in this case is that these processes cannot be completly eliminated 
using trigger systems because the interactions could be produced in the bulk of the detector. Most of 
the  background  events  in  these  channels  are  rejected  because  of  the  presence  of  other  particles  and 
kinematical configurations. 

Radioactive  isotopes  produced  in  the  activation  reactions  represent  a  different  direction  of 

investigation. 

The isotopes of Ar:  35Ar,  37Ar,  39Ar,  41Ar,  42Ar and  43Ar are all radioactive. From all,  41Ar and 
42Ar could be produced by neutron absorption, directly and as successive processes. Because the half-
life of 41Ar is only 109.34 min, the production of 42Ar assumes high fluxes of neutrons.  

The  existence  of  a  very  small  number  of  experimental  data  in  Ar  is  a  major  problem  in  the 
analysis or estimation of the background. In this case we used the simulation of the nuclear reactions 
using TALYS and EMPIRE 3.2 codes to estimate the cross sections.

TALYS [23] is a software package for the simulation of nuclear reactions in the 1 keV  - 200 
MeV  incident  energy  range  for target  mass  numbers  between  12  and  339  and considering  neutrons, 
protons,  deuterons,  tritons,  alphas,  photons  and  hadrons  as  projectiles  and  produced  particles.  The 
code  incorporates  modern  version  of  the  nuclear  models  for  elastic  processes,  direct  reactions,  pre-
equilibrium reactions, compound reactions, fission reactions and a large nuclear structure database. As 
output  information,  the  code  calculates  total  and  partial  cross  sections,  energy  spectrum,  angular 
distributions,  double-differential  spectra, residual  production  cross  sections  and recoils. This  code is 
frequently used by the scientific community for estimations of cross sections of interest in this field.  

EMPIRE 3.2 is an alternative code for the simulation of nuclear reactions [24]. It is designed for 
calculations over a broad range of energies and incident particles. This code covers the same types of 
projectiles as TALYS and the energy range extends from the beginning of the unresolved resonance 
region  for  neutron-induced  reactions  (‚àΩ  keV)  and  goes  up  to  several  hundred  MeV  for  heavy-ion 
induced reactions. As in the case of TALYS, the major nuclear reaction mechanisms accounts. Details 
of  the  models  implemented  can  be  found  in  different  papers,  for  example  in  [25].  This  package 
contains  the  full  EXFOR  (CSISRS)  library  of  experimental  reaction  data  that  are  automatically 
retrieved  during  the  calculations.  In  both  cases  only  predefined  parameters  of  the  codes  were  used. 
These codes were chosen since they contain a wide spectrum of nuclear reaction models that provides 
the quantitative calculations. EMPIRE and TALYS are the only widespread all-in-one codes (meaning 
that  all  required  reaction  mechanisms  are  implemented  in  one  software  package)  [26].  The  results 
obtained using these codes allow a comparative analysis of the predicted cross sections, highlighting 
discrepancies between their results and the comparison with experimental data if available. 

The  elastic  cross  section  (Figure  1)  shows  significant  resonance  behaviour  at  low  energies 
below 650 keV. In the resonance energy region, the availability of measured data is essential for the 
correct understanding of the neutron - argon interaction.

For  energies  above  the resonances,  both  simulation  codes  produce  similar results  and  suggest 
lower cross sections for isotopes  38Ar and  36Ar. The differential cross section for elastic scattering of 
neutrons  from  Ar  at  6.0  MeV  was  measured  by  Mac  Mullin  and  co-workers  [27].  Optical-model 
parameters for the elastic scattering reactions were determined from the best fit to these data and for 
total elastic scattering cross section and was found to differ by 8 % compared to a local optical-model 
for  40Ar,  suggesting  that  new  data  are  necessary  for  improving  parameters  used  in  the  Monte  Carlo 
models for simulations. Very good concordance between the two simulation codes was also obtained 
for n - Ar total cross sections. The results are presents in Figure 2.

  which  has  an 
energy threshold of about 1 MeV [28]. Also, 39Ar can be produced cosmogenically, by negative muon 
capture as discussed, or as capture on  39K, but this aspect is not of interest for the present discussion. 
We  used  both  codes  in  order  to  calculate  the  specific  energy  dependence  of  the  cross  sections  of 
interest in the production of the isotope 39Ar. The results are presented in Figure 3.

The two codes give relatively similar results, with a maximum cross-section at the energy of 18 
MeV when the calculations are made using TALYS and 17 MeV using EMPIRE.  At the maximum, 
the EMPIRE results are about 100 mb values higher than those obtained using TALYS. For energies 
above  30  MeV  the  situation  is  reversed,  and  EMPIRE  generates  values  higher  with  up  to  50  mb. 
Unfortunately, there are no experimental data available.  

Isotope 

.The  half-life  of  this  isotope  is  32.9  years  and  the  beta  decay  of  its  daughter 

isotope, 42K, has the maximum electron energy of 3.52 MeV [29]. Recently, the concentration of 

 and thus 

atoms  per  atom  of  40Ar 
in the  Earth‚Äôs atmosphere was  estimated to  be in the  ratio  of 
[30].  A  possible  way  to  produce  this  isotope  is  a  two  steps  neutron  capture  reaction  in  usual  Ar:

The successive processes induced by neutrons were simulated using TALYS and EMPIRE. The 
results are presented in Figure 4. The experimental data for  ùê¥ùëü(ùëõ, ùõæ) ùê¥ùëü
 reaction are from EXFOR 
library.  The  results  for  TALYS  give  relative  confidence  with  experimental  data  while  the  EMPIRE 
code overestimates the data with a factor of around (5√∑7). For the second reaction, experimental data 
do not exist.

Experimental data from EXFOR, from [31; 32, 33] are also shown. 

The alternative process induced by alpha particles was previously investigated [34, 35] and the 
maximum in the cross section is around 10 mb. This process was not considered in this contribution 
because it is improbable to produce alpha particles in the bulk of argon. 

Isotope 37S can be produced as (n, Œ±) reaction. The energy of the emitted Œ≤-particle equals 4.86 
MeV. Its half-life is ~5.05 min. In this case, the cross-section calculated with EMPIRE fits better the 
available experimental data than the one obtained using TALYS ‚Äì see Figure 5. 

Discrepancies up to a factor of 2 between these two codes were obtained. For energies above 22 

MeV the codes predict similar cross sections.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

Ar is one of the most important materials used in neutrino experiments, being used as target and 
detector.  One  important  direction  of  study  is  the  investigation  of  the  sources  of  production  of 
radioactive  isotopes  inside  Ar  bulk.  It  is  crucial  to  understand  the  associated  radioactive 
contamination,  especially  the  production  of  muons,  neutrons  and  radioactive  isotopes.  In  this 
contribution, negative muon capture in Ar as well as production of radioactive Ar are discussed. Even 
if the production rates calculated with these cross-sections are small, considering the large amount of 
liquid argon used as detector we can say that this kind of study is very important in avoiding the false 
signals that may appear in the detection system. These investigations are in progress.
