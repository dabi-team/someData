Abstract

The solar-neutrino detectors GALLEX [1–3] and SAGE [4] were calibrated by electron-neutrino

ﬂux from the 37Ar and 51Cr calibration sources. A deﬁcit in the measured neutrino ﬂux was recorded

by counting the number of neutrino-induced conversions of the 71Ga nuclei to 71Ge nuclei. This

deﬁcit was coined “gallium anomaly” and it has lead to speculations about beyond-the-standard-

model physics in the form of eV-mass sterile neutrinos. Notably, this anomaly has already deﬁed

ﬁnal solution for more than 20 years. Here we reassess the statistical signiﬁcance of this anomaly

and improve the related statistical approaches by treating the neutrino experiments as repeated

Bernoulli trials taking into account the fact that the number of the detected 71Ge nuclei is quite

small, thus calling for a Bayesian statistical approach.

In addition, we take into account the

systematic errors of the experiments, their correlations, theoretical uncertainties and the number of

background solar-neutrino events as a Poisson-distributed random variable. To compare with the

previously reported statistical signiﬁcances of the anomaly we convert the posterior intervals of our

Bayesian approach to standard deviations σ of the frequentist approach. We ﬁnd that our approach

reduces the statistical signiﬁcance of the anomaly by 0.8 σ for all the adopted theoretical approaches.

This renders the gallium anomaly a statistically weakly supported concept. Furthermore, the

implications of our approach go far beyond the gallium anomaly since the results of many rare-

events experiments should be reassessed for their limited number of recorded events.

MAIN

The Gallium-based solar-neutrino detectors of the GALLEX [1–3] and SAGE [4] experi-

ments have been subjected to detection-eﬃciency testing with strong 37Ar and 51Cr neutrino

sources. The neutrinos emitted by these sources have discrete energies below 1 MeV. The

detection is based on the charged-current neutrino-nucleus scattering reaction

νe + 71Ga(3/2−

g.s.) → 71Ge(J π) + e−,

(1)

leading to low-lying states of multipolarity J π in 71Ge, mainly to the ground state and the

excited states at 175 keV and 500 keV.

The neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section for the scattering to the ground state can be

deduced from the half-life of 71Ge and is thus well known [5]. However, the total cross section

contains also the scatterings to the excited states as well. Being short-lived states, the cross

section for these states cannot be determined via β-decay half-life measurements, and so

other methods must be employed. Two ways for dealing with this have been proposed: Use

either charge-exchange reactions to probe the Gamow-Teller strength for transitions from the

ground state of 71Ga to the states in 71Ge [6] or use a microscopic nuclear model, such as the

nuclear shell model [7, 8], to directly compute the cross sections for the scattering transitions

to the 71Ge ﬁnal states. With both of these approaches the theoretical estimates have been

systematically larger than the values reported by GALLEX and SAGE, the experimental

values being for example 0.87 ± 0.05 times the cross sections based on the theory estimates

by Bahcall [5]. The origins of these discrepancies have been previously discussed in [7, 9, 10].

The mismatch between the measured and theoretical cross sections constitutes the so-called

“gallium anomaly”.

One of the suggested explanations for the anomaly is the oscillation of the electron neu-

trino to an eV mass-scale sterile neutrino [9, 10], which could potentially also explain the

so-called “reactor-antineutrino anomaly” [11–13]. However, it should be remarked here that

there is no accepted sterile-neutrino model which could explain the experimental anomalies

consistently. Less exotic solutions to the reactor-antineutrino anomaly, like the proper inclu-

sion of ﬁrst-forbidden β-decay branches in the construction of the cumulative antineutrino

spectra, have also been suggested [14, 15].

The GALLEX and SAGE experiments (gallium experiments for short) can be thought of

as repeated Bernoulli trials with a single 71Ga atom in a small area (measured in cm2) with

2

a projectile neutrino hitting the square in a uniformly distributed random spot. The result

of one of these trials can be either a “success” (i.e. neutrino-nucleus scattering happens) or

a “failure” (no scattering). The cross section (in cm2) is the probability of the scattering to

occur. The experiments record the number of germanium atoms produced (from which one

can deduce the number of events), the neutrino ﬂux, and the number of target atoms to some

ﬁnite accuracy, reporting the cross section as a (possibly asymmetric) normal distribution.

In the papers [1–4] the statistical errors are related to the number of Bernoulli trials (neutrino

ﬂux, number of target nuclei) and successes (number of 71Ge atoms produced). While the

normal-distribution approximation is asymptotically valid for large number of trials (and

events), this condition is not well satisﬁed in the gallium experiments (or in any rare-events

experiment with a small number of recorded events), since the number of observed events is

small.

The small number of events recorded in the gallium experiments produces a major source

of uncertainty in their reported results. The number of events in the experiments varied

between approximately 360 and 520 [1–4, 16]. Basic probability theory tells us that given the

number of successes s and attempts n in a repeated Bernoulli trial the success probability

p has a likelihood function Beta(s, n − s). The relative error (the ratio of the standard

deviation to the expected value) for small success probabilities follows the law 1/

√

s, and is

thus valid for the neutrino experiments. This uncertainty is then 4.2–5.2 % in the gallium

experiments. Moreover, the cross-section distribution is highly asymmetric for such small

success probabilities. Since the relative uncertainty is not proportional to the number of

trials but only depends on the number of successes, we can take the small area which the

neutron hits to be 1 cm2, since then the numerical value of the cross section is the probability

of success in a single trial. Note that we could have equivalently picked an area e.g. 0.25

cm2 with the number of trials being reduced to fourth and the parameter here being four

times the cross section and the results would remain unchanged.

In the analysis of the GALLEX and SAGE experiments the production rate of 71Ge,

that is, how many neutrinos interacted with the detector in a day, was assessed for the

individual runs (3–28 days) separately. The analysis was based on a maximum likelihood ﬁt

with constant solar neutrino background. The ﬁnal result was derived by taking an average

weighted by the inverse variances of the individual runs. However, there is a much more

simple way to deal with the solar-neutrino background and to combine the individual runs.

FIG. 1: Posterior distributions for the experiment-to-theory ratio R. The normal distributions

are those used in the previous analyses of the gallium experiments.

Since we assume that the neutrino interactions are independent we can see that the events

are exchangeable [17]. This means that we do not get any more information by knowing the

number of events in the individual runs. The total number of events is a suﬃcient statistic

(see e.g. [18]) meaning that all the relevant information regarding the probability of success

(cross section) is included in this number. Thus a more straight-forward way would be to

measure the total number of events (including the background) and subtract the number of

background events as a Poisson distributed variable. The resulting distribution can then by

calculated by simulation.

In this paper we revisit the statistical signiﬁcance of the gallium anomaly by reassessing

the ratio R between the cross sections of the GALLEX and SAGE experiments and those of

the theory using a Bayesian approach. In this spirit we construct posterior distributions for

R and our simulation-based approach allows us to take into account properly such details

as the correlations between the systematic errors of the two GALLEX experiments as well

as between the two SAGE experiments.

The diﬀerence between the simple normal distributions used in the recent survey [8]

and the properly constructed posterior distributions for the ratio R are shown in Fig. 1

for the estimates of Bahcall [5], the shell-model results of Kostensalo et al.

[8] and the

charge-exchange results of Frekers et al. [6]. As clearly visible from the ﬁgures, the posterior

distributions are wider than the previously adopted normal distributions and they are shifted

slightly to the right. In addition, the skewness of these distributions shifts probability to

the right of R = 1 relative to the normal distributions. Since the uncertainty related to

TABLE I: Magnitude of the gallium anomaly in diﬀerent theoretical frameworks. The column

“Posterior ETI” gives the width of the smallest equivalently-tailed posterior interval in which the

experiment to theory ratio 1 is included. Column “Signiﬁcance” gives the corresponding

signiﬁcance for a normal distribution in standard deviations σ. The last column gives the

previously reported standard deviations, all distributions being assumed to be normal and the

systematic errors independent, even for the same detectors. The second and ﬁfth rows include a

30% tensor correction for the excited states. The “Combined theory” in the last row includes the

tensor-corrected Bachall, Kostensalo et al., and the tensor-corrected Frekers el al. results weighted

by their inverse variances.

estimating the success probability p of a binomial distribution is proportional to the inverse

square root of the number of successes, this error is larger in the experiments with lower

number of successes. This means that for the normal distributions the experiments with a

low number of events are overweighted relative to the rest of the experiments, making the

anomaly appear larger than it actually is.

The statistical signiﬁcances of the results are given in Table I. The results are reported

as equivalent-tailed posterior intervals (ETI), that is, the null-hypothesis (no anomaly) is

included, for example, in the 93.6% posterior interval of the uncorrected Bahcall results. To

allow a simple comparison with the previously reported results, this is also expressed in a

frequentistic way as sigmas of a normal-distribution (the column “Signiﬁcance”). The drop

in the corresponding frequentistic signiﬁcance is about 0.8 σ for all the theoretical models.

The most recent theoretical estimate by Kostensalo et al. gives no evidence in favor of the

gallium anomaly. Furthermore, the combined theoretical results also includes R = 1 in the

95% ETI. Without any tensor corrections the Frekers et al. results still noticeably deviate

5

from the GALLEX and SAGE results but only at 2.22 σ instead of the previously reported

3.0 σ. Tensor contributions of the magnitude proposed in [8] seem to be able to explain

away most of the remaining discrepancies.

In this Letter the statistical signiﬁcance of the so-called “gallium anomaly” was reassessed

using a Bayesian approach, in which we constructed posterior probability distributions for

the ratio R of the experimental and theoretical cross sections.

It was pointed out that

a neutrino-detection experiment can be formulated as a repeated Bernoulli trial with the

reported cross section being the probability of “success” i.e. a detected event. This means,

that even with perfect knowledge of the number of detected events, neutrinos hitting the

target, and number of target nuclei, one would end up with a beta distribution for the cross

section. This conclusion goes even beyond the present context and embraces all rear-events

experiments with a limited number of detected events.

The size of the gallium anomaly was assessed by a simulation taking into account the

systematic and statistical errors in the GALLEX and SAGE experiments, theoretical un-

certainties, correlations in systematic errors, the number of the background solar-neutrino

events as a Poisson distributed random variable, as well as the relatively small number of

neutrinos observed. The recent shell-model results of Kostensalo et al. were shown to agree

with the GALLEX and SAGE results within the 95 % posterior interval.

In a previous

frequentistic analysis [9], this signiﬁcance was reported as 2.3 σ. Taking into account all the

theoretical estimates with proper corrections for tensor contributions, the theoretical and

experimental results are shown to agree within the 95 % posterior interval. This means that

there is little evidence of the gallium anomaly relating to new physics.

METHODS

We adopt a Bayesian approach [17] to reassess the signiﬁcance of the discrepancies be-

tween the theoretical cross sections and the results from GALLEX and SAGE gallium exper-

iments. We construct posterior distributions for the 51Cr and 37Ar cross sections from which

we obtain a posterior distribution for the theory-to-experiment ratio R. The approach is

motivated by a multitude of reasons: First, we can easily incorporate various heterogeneous

sources of uncertainty in the statistical model, including the correlated systematic errors of

the two GALLEX experiments, without having to resort to approximations. Second, while

TABLE II: The number of events (neutrino-nucleus interactions) and the number of Bernoulli

trials in each gallium experiment based on all the available information. A single trial consists of

one neutrino hitting a 1 cm2 square with a single gallium atom in a uniformly distributed random

spot. To avoid underestimating the thickness of the tails we avoid approximating e.g. the product

of normal distributions as a normal distribution. The reports of SAGE included more details in

regard to the experimental set-up, which is why the expression for the number of trials diﬀers

from GALLEX. While the normal approximation would work ﬁne here we want to stress that this

is not true in general.

the models for the true number of unobserved events, the total number of neutrinos and the

cross sections are fairly simple, the hierarchical structure quickly becomes more complicated

when we connect the actual measured quantities to the true underlying latent variables,

making a graphical model suitable for the task. Third, powerful computational methods are

readily available for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.

Let index i ∈ {G1, G2, S1, S2} denote the experiment. The neutrino source used in each
experiment is indexed by j(i) such that j(G1) = j(G2) = j(S1) = 51Cr and j(S2) = 37Ar.

The unobserved theoretical cross sections to be estimated are σj(i), which are then compared

to the theoretical cross sections σth,j(i) in order to access the experiment-to-theory ratio R.

The true number of observed events in the experiments is yi and the true total number of

trials is ni. The numbers used in this work are given in Table II. The number of trials

includes a small correction, between 0.3 and 1.7 %, in order to reproduce the best estimate

for the experimental rates. This is due to round-oﬀ errors and the limited accuracy of the

reported run times.

We construct a hierarchical model for the experiments as follows. The repeated indepen-

dent Bernoulli trials result in a binomial likelihood

yi|ni, σj(i) ∼ Bin(ni, σj(i))

7

for all i ∈ {G1, G2, S1, S2}. We select highly uninformative prior distributions for the unob-

served cross sections σj(i) by taking

σ51Cr ∼ Beta(1/2, 1)

σ37Ar ∼ Beta(1/2, 1).

The distribution Beta(1/2, 1) has most of its probability mass centered near 0, reﬂecting

our a priori understanding that the unknown cross sections are more likely to be small than

large while residing somewhere on the interval (0, 1). In essence, we do not make any strong

subjective claims about the cross sections and choose to rely on the information obtained

from the experiments.

Due to the conjugacy of the beta and binomial distributions, we obtain the posteriors

directly as beta distributions with updated parameters

If the required quantities ni and yi were known exactly, we could simply generate values

from the posterior distributions of the cross sections σj(i) and from the reported distributions

for the theoretical cross sections σth,j(i) to obtain a posterior distribution for R. However,

there is additional uncertainty associated with the measurements in each experiment which

we take into account in our model.

We simulate the posterior distributions of the cross sections via MCMC using JAGS

(Just Another Gibbs Sampler, [19]) in the statistical software R [20]. In order to estimate

8

the experiment-to-theory ratio R, we also simulate values for the theoretical cross sections

σth,j(i) from distributions given in the literature. For every theory of table I, the simulation is

carried out using 10 chains with diﬀerent initial values. One million samples are drawn from

each chain with a warm-up period of 100 000 samples, while only including every 10th draw in

the ﬁnal posterior sample, totaling one million draws from the posterior for each theoretical

estimate. Convergence of the MCMC chains was monitored using the adjusted potential

scale reduction factor [21, 22], which is a suitable criterion in this case since the posterior

of R is approximately Gaussian. This particular simulation is not very computationally

demanding and can be easily performed with a modern laptop.
