ABSTRACT
We investigate a global extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave associated with a coronal
mass ejection (CME)-driven shock on 2017 September 10. The EUV wave is transmitted
by north- and south-polar coronal holes (CHs), which is observed by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory A (STEREO-A) from
opposite sides of the Sun. We obtain key ﬁndings on how the EUV wave interacts
with multiple coronal structures, and on its connection with the CME-driven shock:
(1) the transmitted EUV wave is still connected with the shock that is incurvated to
the Sun, after the shock has reached the opposite side of the eruption; (2) the south
CH transmitted EUV wave is accelerated inside an on-disk, low-density region with
closed magnetic ﬁelds, which implies that an EUV wave can be accelerated in both
open and closed magnetic ﬁeld regions; (3) part of the primary EUV wavefront turns
around a bright point (BP) with a bipolar magnetic structure when it approaches a
dim, low-density ﬁlament channel near the BP; (4) the primary EUV wave is diﬀused
and apparently halted near the boundaries of remote active regions (ARs) that are far
from the eruption, and no obvious AR related secondary waves are detected; (5) the
EUV wave extends to an unprecedented scale of ∼360◦ in latitudes, which is attributed
to the polar CH transmission. These results provide insights into the eﬀects of coronal
density and magnetic ﬁeld distributions on the evolution of an EUV wave, and into the
connection between the EUV wave and the associated CME-driven shock.

1. INTRODUCTION

A solar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave is a
large-scale intensity disturbance propagating in
the corona, which was proposed to be the coro-
nal counterpart (e.g., Thompson et al. 1999;
Warmuth et al. 2004a; Muhr et al. 2010; Asai
et al. 2012) of the “Moreton wave” (More-

ton 1960). Observations and simulations sug-
gest that large-scale EUV waves associated with
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are fast-mode
magnetohydrodynamic waves/shocks driven by
the expanding CMEs (e.g., Zhukov & Auch`ere
2004; Cohen et al. 2009; Patsourakos & Vourl-
idas 2009; Liu et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2012;

Liu et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013). An EUV
wave will probably decouple from the driving
CME after the expansion ceases in the corona,
which is supposed to be the low-corona footprint
of an expanding fast-mode shock at the initial
stage (e.g., Cheng et al. 2012; Patsourakos &
Vourlidas 2012; Kwon et al. 2014). Observa-
tions reveal that part of a CME-driven shock
can propagate in the opposite direction of the
CME propagation and reach the side of the Sun
opposite to its associated eruption (e.g., Kwon
et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017). However, the con-
nection between an EUV wave and the accom-
panied shock after the latter has propagated to
the opposite side is not well investigated yet.

Coronal magnetic structures, e.g., coronal
holes (CHs) and active regions (ARs), can aﬀect
the propagation of an EUV wave. Gopalswamy
et al. (2009) reported an EUV wave reﬂected
from a CH. Both reﬂection from and trans-
mission through a CH have been observed by
Olmedo et al. (2012). Shen et al. (2013) re-
ported the diﬀraction, refraction, and reﬂection
of an EUV wave interacting with remote ARs.
Obvious secondary waves have been observed
on the far side of remote ARs that are near the
eruption site in previous studies (e.g., Li et al.
2012; Shen et al. 2013). In this paper, we will
see that the secondary wave beyond a remote
AR can hardly be detected if the AR is too
far from the eruption site. Elevation of EUV
wave speed inside a dim coronal cavity of low
density on the solar limb has been reported by
Liu et al. (2012). We will investigate the eﬀect
of a low-density closed magnetic ﬁeld structure
on the propagation of an EUV wave, when the
structure is on the solar disk. We also ﬁnd
that a bright point (BP) with a small bipolar
magnetic structure inﬂuences the wavefront of
an EUV wave in combination with a ﬁlament
channel. Large-scale EUV waves propagate to
distances statistically in the range of 350–850
Mm (Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2012). However,

it is still unclear how large and persistent an
EUV wave could be and what contributes to its
globalization and persistence.

In this paper we report a persistent, global
EUV wave with a very large scale that interacts
with multiple low-density regions with closed
magnetic ﬁelds, ARs, and CHs. The global
EUV wave was accompanied by an X8.2 ﬂare
and a violent CME driving a shock on the west
limb of the Sun on 2017 September 10, which
was observed by spacecraft on the opposite sides
of the Sun. The related coronal and interplan-
etary properties have been studied in several
works (e.g., Seaton & Darnel 2018; Li et al.
2018; Yan et al. 2018; Goryaev et al. 2018; Luh-
mann et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018; Cheng et al.
2018; Liu et al. 2019).
In this paper we ana-
lyze the observations of Solar Terrestrial Rela-
tions Observatory A (STEREO-A), Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO), Geostationary Op-
erational Environmental Satellite 16 (GOES-
16 ), and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) from nearly opposite sides of the Sun.
The time frame of this work was coincident
with that of Liu et al. (2018), which is based
on single-spacecraft observations. We perform
further analysis using observations from multi-
ple spacecraft, which covers almost 360◦ of the
Sun. This paper focuses on the connection with
the accompanied CME-driven shock at a later
stage; the alterations of the speed and wave-
front caused by low-density regions, a BP, ARs,
and CHs; and the long persistence of the EUV
wave. The global properties of the EUV wave
and its connection with the CME-driven shock
observed from two sides of the Sun are investi-
gated in Section 2. The interactions with coro-
nal structures and the global scale of the EUV
wave are studied in Section 3. We conclude and
discuss the results in Section 4. Our results im-
prove the knowledge of the connection with the
CME-driven shock and highlight the eﬀects of
coronal density and magnetic ﬁeld distributions

on the propagation and globalization of an EUV
wave.

2. GLOBAL PROPERTIES AND

ASSOCIATED SHOCK

The global EUV wave is associated with an
energetic CME driving a shock and an X8.2
ﬂare from AR 12673 (S08◦W88◦) that peaked
at 16:06 UT on 2017 September 10. The Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO
(Lemen et al. 2012) and the Extreme Ultravio-
let Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO (Kaiser
et al. 2008) are advantageous when observing
the Sun in EUV bands from multiple viewpoints
(e.g., Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2009; Liu et al.
2011, 2014; Olmedo et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2017;
Zhu et al. 2018). Figure 1 shows the EUV ob-
servations of SDO/AIA 211 ˚A near the Earth
and STEREO-A/EUVI (EUVI-A) 195 ˚A from
∼128◦ east of the Earth. The dark regions in the
AIA 211 ˚A (Figure 1a) and EUVI-A 195 ˚A (Fig-
ure 1b) images illustrate three CHs in the north-
and south-polar regions as well as a northern
midlatitude area. The open magnetic ﬁeld lines
(green and red lines in Figure 1a-b) derived from
a potential-ﬁeld source-surface (PFSS) model
also demonstrate the CHs. “BP” marks a BP
that has a bipolar magnetic structure. Arrows
“1” and “2” in Figure 1(a) denote two dim re-
gions where the coronal density and possibly
also the temperature are relatively low. The
running-diﬀerence (RD) image of AIA 211 ˚A
(Figure 1c) shows that the EUV wave was prop-
agating on the western solar disk away from the
ﬂare site (indicated by arrow “A”) at 16:11 UT.
The EUV wave was interacting with the polar
CHs near 60◦ north and south latitudes on the
west limb, as indicated by arrows “B” and “C”.
RD images of AIA 211, 193, and 171 ˚A are syn-
thesized to red-green-blue color images and then
join the RD images of EUVI-A 195 ˚A (similar
to Figure 1d) to make an animation for Figure
1(c-d). The animation illustrates that the EUV
wave is reﬂected and also transmitted by both

3

the north- and south-polar CHs, which is also
reported by Liu et al. (2018). Two antipoleward
transmitted waves emanate along the bound-
aries of the two polar CHs, which are indicated
by the cyan arrows in Figure 1(c-d). Further-
more, the north transmitted wave is transmit-
ted once again by the midlatitude CH (marked
with “CH” in Figure 1c) and produces a sec-
ondary wave along the southern boundary of the
CH, which is visible in the animation of Figure
1. The wavefronts of the transmitted waves on
the limb (denoted with arrows “D” and “E”)
are forwardly inclined, which are also observed
on the east limb by AIA in the animation of
Figure 1. Note that there is no driving CME
structure following the transmitted EUV wave,
which is diﬀerent from the explanation with the
downward expansion of a CME structure in Liu
et al. (2012). This suggests that the wave speed
increases with the altitude in the low corona,
which is consistent with the model of Uchida
(1968). The CME structure and the primary
EUV wavefront are obvious in the EUVI-A im-
ages from 15:55 to 15:58 UT in the animation
of Figure 1, which agrees with a primary EUV
wave being a fast-mode wave/shock driven by
the associated CME (e.g., Patsourakos & Vourl-
idas 2009; Liu et al. 2011; Cheng et al. 2012;
Downs et al. 2012). As a shock signature (e.g.,
Warmuth et al. 2004b; Liu et al. 2009; Nitta
et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2018), a
type II radio burst associated with our case is
also detected by ground-based radio spectrom-
eters (Gopalswamy et al. 2018).

A large CME-driven shock is observed by
coronagraphs on board STEREO-A and SOHO,
which propagates to the opposite side of the
eruption. Liu et al. (2019) present a study
of the geometry and kinematics of the CME-
driven shock in relation to its heliospheric im-
pacts combining remote-sensing and in situ ob-
servations. Here we focus on the connection
with the EUV wave and the morphology of the

panels (c-d) is available, which begins at 15:40 UT and ends at 17:26 UT. In the left panel of the animation,

CME-driven shock on the opposite side of the
eruption, which have not been fully understood
yet. A three-dimensional (3D) modeled struc-
ture of the shock based on imaging observations
from STEREO-A, SOHO, and GOES-16 is il-
lustrated in Figure 2 (also see Liu et al. 2019).
The 3D model
is developed by Kwon et al.
(2014) using an ellipsoid structure to represent
a CME-driven shock, which can determine the
3D outermost structure of the shock by ﬁtting
multiple-viewpoint imaging observations (e.g.,
Kwon & Vourlidas 2017; Zhu et al. 2018; Liu
et al. 2019). The ellipsoid model has seven free
parameters: the height, longitude, and latitude
of the center of the ellipsoid; the lengths of the
three semiprincipal axes; and the rotation angle
of the ellipsoid. In our ﬁtting, the two semiprin-
cipal axes perpendicular to the radial direction
are set to equal, which reduces two free parame-
ters (one semiprincipal axis and the rotation an-
gle). We ﬁt the parameters by visually matching
the ellipsoid structure and the shock feature in
the RD images from two viewpoints as shown
in Figure 2. Images of GOES-16 Solar Ultravi-
olet Imager (SUVI) with a larger ﬁeld of view
(FOV) instead of those of SDO/AIA are used
in the ﬁtting. At 16:00 UT, the lateral bound-
ary of the ellipsoid is determined by both the
EUV (panels a-b of Figure 2) and coronagraph
images (panels c-d), and the radial boundary
is restricted by the coronagraph images. As
shown in Figure 2(a), the intersection (the solid
cyan curve on the disk) of the ellipsoid and the
Sun surface is consistent with the primary EUV
wavefront, which agrees with a primary EUV
wave being the footprint of a CME-driven shock
at the initial stage (e.g., Li et al. 2012; Kwon
In Figure 2(b), the dashed cyan
et al. 2014).
ellipse illustrates that the intersection is on the
side opposite to STEREO-A, which is consistent
with that no on-disk EUV wave was detected by
EUVI-A around 16:00 UT. Veronig et al. (2018)
suggest that the EUV wave observed by SUVI

is connected with the shock detected by C2 and
detaches from the CME structure in the ini-
tial stage. The shock is caused by the impul-
sive expansion of the CME structure (Veronig
et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019). Therefore, it is still
appropriate to call the shock a “CME-driven”
shock despite the early detachment of the shock
from the CME structure. In this paper we ﬁt
only the CME-driven shock using the 3D ellip-
soid model. Investigation of the CME geometry
can be seen in, e.g., Gopalswamy et al. (2018),
Veronig et al. (2018), and Liu et al. (2019).
Figure 2(e-f) present the modeled shock struc-
ture at ∼16:11 UT, and show that the shock
has almost propagated backward to the oppo-
site side of the eruption. However, on that time
the primary EUV wave was still in the western
hemisphere of the Sun (see Figure 1c). The pri-
mary EUV wave lasted about 40 minutes from
∼15:50 UT to ∼16:30 UT, and the transmitted
waves started around 16:06 UT and faded out
after 17:00 UT. It is surprising that the EUV
waves can persist for ∼50 minutes even after
the CME-driven shock has propagated to the
opposite side of the eruption.

Figure 3 depicts the connection with the EUV
wave and the morphology of the backward prop-
agating shock. As indicated by the two hori-
zontal arrows in panel (a), the RD image of
STEREO-A/COR2 clearly displays that the
northern and southern parts of the shock on the
opposite side of the eruption are “incurvated”
to the Sun and form a “funnel-like” structure.
The incurvated southern part of the shock ob-
served by COR2 around 16:24 UT is cospatial
with the lateral shock observed by COR1 as
marked by the two vertical arrows in panel (a).
The RD COR1 image overlaid with a RD EUVI
image in panel (b) (which is enlarged in panel c)
obviously shows that the southern lateral shock
in the COR1 image also spatially corresponds to
the aforementioned south-polar CH transmitted
EUV wave. It is indicated that the incurvated

shock observed by the coronagraphs on board
STEREO-A is still connected with the trans-
mitted EUV wave on the opposite side of the
eruption. The incurvation can also be seen in
the RD SOHO/C2 image in panel (d), although
the shock feature is relatively faint. The spatial
correspondence between the transmitted EUV
wave and the lateral shock is not deﬁnitely ob-
served as shown in Figure 3(f). However, the
transmitted EUV wave on the limb is approx-
imately radially aligned with the shock, which
also suggests that they are connected. A corre-

sponding northern lateral shock is not visible in
the RD COR1 image, which is probably because
it is relatively weak. However, the animation of
Figure 3 of RD SOHO/C2 images shows a lat-
eral collision between two coronal structures on
the opposite side of the eruption around 18:11
UT, which is also marked by the arrow in Figure
3(e). The two colliding structures are probably
streamers pushed by the southern and northern
lateral parts of the shock. (Streamers on the op-
posite side of the eruption are indeed observed
in C2 images that are not presented here.) The

is incurvated to the Sun and still connected with

wave along “S1”. We employ a three-point La-
grangian interpolation to obtain the speed of
the EUV wave and use the approximate values,
which is adequate to analyze the general speed
variation in this paper, although the interpo-
lation may not be suﬃciently accurate as sug-
gested by Byrne et al. (2013). The transmitted
wave was traveling inside the south-polar region
with a high local characteristic wave speed be-
fore ∼16:10 UT. The wave speed dropped from
∼1500 km s−1 to below 500 km s−1 after the
transmitted wave left the south-polar region.
However, the wave was unexpectedly acceler-

The acceleration is associated with an AIA 211
˚A dim region (Dim Region 1, indicated by arrow
“1” in Figure 1a) that is also dimmer than its
neighboring areas in the 171 and 193 ˚A bands.
The lower EUV intensity suggests that the den-
sity and possibly the temperature are lower in
the dim region. A low density can cause a
high characteristic wave speed by increasing the
Alfv´en speed. However, the possible low tem-
perature can hardly decrease the speed in the
low corona with plasma beta β < 1. The accel-
eration around 16:27 UT as shown in Figure 4
is consistent with the high characteristic speed
inside the dim region. The acceleration inside
the dim region is not similar to that caused by
a bright AR (e.g., Li et al. 2012). As shown by
the PFSS modeling results in Figure 1(a), the
dim region is with closed magnetic ﬁelds and is
also diﬀerent from a CH. No ﬁlament associated
with Dim Region 1 is observed in GONG Hα
images. As displayed in Figure 5, we enhance
the contrast of the oﬀ-limb corona in AIA 211
and 193 ˚A images at the beginning of Septem-
ber 7 (when Dim Region 1 was traversing the
east limb). With no obvious prominence signa-
ture, a plausible cavity (indicated by the ver-
tical arrow) was above the corresponding site
of the dim region (indicated by the horizontal
arrow). This implies that Dim Region 1 with
closed magnetic ﬁelds is the on-disk signature of
a cavity in the corona, assuming that the coro-
nal structure did not change much in the past
three days. Liu et al. (2012) note that an oﬀ-
limb coronal cavity could elevate the EUV wave
speed. Acceleration associated with an on-disk
dim region with closed magnetic ﬁelds similar
to our case has not been reported previously.
In our case, the acceleration may be caused by
the on-disk low-density cavity with closed mag-
netic ﬁelds, although the cavity is not a typical
one embedding a ﬁlament (e.g., Liu et al. 2012;
Forland et al. 2013).

Figure 6 presents the EUV and Hα imaging
observations of an area speciﬁed by the dashed
square in Figure 1(c). The diamond represents
the BP that has a bipolar magnetic structure
resembling a small AR as displayed in the inset
overlaid in panel (b). In the inset the green and
red closed curves indicate the positive and neg-
ative polarities of the magnetic ﬁeld, which are
linked by bright loops. The BP emerged around
23:00 UT on September 8 and started to fade on
September 13. The white closed curve in Figure
6 delineates another dim region (Dim Region 2,
denoted with arrow “2” in Figure 1a). A ﬁla-
ment associated with Dim Region 2 is observed
in the GONG Hα and AIA 304 ˚A images (indi-
cated by the arrows in Figure 6d-e). The AIA
193 ˚A image in panel (f) illustrates that Dim
Region 2 corresponds to the ﬁlament channel.
The low EUV intensity indicates that Dim Re-
gion 2 is also of low density and has a high
characteristic wave speed like Dim Region 1.
The dashed line in Figure 6(a-c) represents the
approximate primary EUV wavefront, which is
visually identiﬁed from the enhanced intensity
in the AIA 211 ˚A RD images. The wavefront
turns ∼50◦ around the BP from 16:08 to 16:20
UT. The EUV wave inside the low-density ﬁl-
ament channel propagates faster than outside,
whereas the wave interacting with the BP (a
bipolar magnetic structure) is halted. These
cause diﬀerent speeds for diﬀerent parts of the
wavefront and eventually make the wavefront
direction turn around the BP.

Figure 7 displays the distance-time proﬁles of
the primary EUV wave along slits “S2-5” from
the observations of AIA 211 ˚A (panels a-b) and
EUVI-A 195 ˚A (panels c-d). As shown in panel

the boundary of AR 12672 at ∼1300 Mm along
“S4”, but propagates as far as 1700 Mm along
“S5” without ARs on its path. The average
speeds along “S2-5” are 600–700 km s−1. No
obvious transmitted secondary wave is observed
on the far side of the ARs, which is diﬀerent
from the cases in Li et al. (2012) and Shen et al.
(2013) with remote ARs within 400 Mm from
the eruptions. However, the animation of Fig-
ure 1 shows that the primary EUV wave contin-
ues propagating after it passes AR 12674. AR
12674 is close to the ﬂare site with a distance
of ∼300 Mm, where the expanding CME is ex-
pected to be still driving the EUV wave. This

may be the reason that the EUV wave travels
beyond AR 12674.

Figure 8 shows three synoptic maps made by
combining the RD images of AIA 211 ˚A and
EUVI-A 195 ˚A, which illustrates the evolution
of the EUV wave on the entire solar disk (de-
spite the unobservable area) viewed from two
opposite sides of the Sun. Panel (a) shows that
the primary EUV wave (indicated by the cyan
arrows) was observed by AIA and was just en-
tering the FOV of EUVI-A around 16:05 UT.
The GONG synoptic plot marks the CHs cov-
ering the polar regions above ∼60◦ north and
south latitude. The EUV wave is transmitted
and also refracted by the CHs, which changes

the propagation direction to equatorward. The
south transmitted wave (indicated by the verti-
cal arrows in Figure 8b) emanates roughly along
the boundary of the south-polar CH. The trans-
mitted waves are traveling antipoleward along
all meridians from the polar CHs and are ob-
served simultaneously by SDO and STEREO-
A, as displayed in Figure 8(c). The red arrow
indicates a collision between the primary and
transmitted waves, which is also visible in the
animation of Figure 8. Corresponding parts of
the primary wavefront are diﬀused when inter-
acting with the remote ARs (marked with cir-
cles in Figure 8), and no obvious EUV wave

is detected beyond the ARs (except AR 12674
that is close to the ﬂare site). The primary EUV
wave extends to a scale of ∼180◦ (∼30◦–∼210◦)
in the longitudinal direction before it becomes
too faint to be detected. The transmitted waves
travel away from the polar CHs and reach the
equator on the opposite side of the ﬂare. The
EUV wave is reﬂected and transmitted by both
the north- and south-polar CHs, and propagates
through the 360◦ solar disk, as simultaneously
observed by SDO and STEREO-A from two al-
most opposite sides of the Sun, which is an un-
precedented event.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

We have investigated the sustained, global
EUV wave and its connection with the accom-
panied CME-driven shock associated with the
2017 September 10 eruption, using the obser-
vations from SDO, STEREO-A, GOES-16 and
SOHO. The EUV wave is reﬂected and also
transmitted by both the north- and south-polar
CHs. Two transmitted waves emanate respec-
tively from the two polar CHs and then prop-
agate through the entire solar disk, which is
unprecedentedly observed from two nearly op-
posite sides of the Sun. The reﬂection and
transmission, which have also been observed
by Liu et al. (2018) using single-spacecraft ob-
servations, are consistent with the fast-mode
wave/shock interpretation for an EUV wave.
We have examined the connection with the ac-
companied CME-driven shock and the interac-
tions with multiple coronal structures of the
EUV wave. Below we conclude the results and
discuss the signiﬁcant eﬀects of coronal density
and magnetic ﬁeld distributions on the global-
ization of the EUV wave and how the global
EUV wave is connected with the CME-driven
shock.

1. After the CME-driven shock has propa-
gated to the opposite side of the eruption,
the shock is incurvated to the Sun and still
connected with the CH transmitted EUV
wave. The 3D ellipsoid model reveals that
the primary EUV wave is the footprint
of the CME-driven shock at the initial
stage. After the shock has reached the
opposite side, the incurvated shock forms
a “funnel-like” structure and is still con-
nected with the transmitted EUV wave
(see Figure 3), although the northern part
of the shock is not clearly observed by
STEREO-A/COR1. The primary EUV
wave is still on the western hemisphere
even after the shock has already propa-
gated to the opposite side of the erup-

13

tion. The transmitted EUV waves in
the polar regions propagate much faster
than the primary EUV wave in low- and
midlatitudes (see the animation of Fig-
If the primary EUV wave is
ure 1).
also connected with the shock on the op-
posite side, the part of the shock cou-
pled with the transmitted wave may also
propagate faster than its counterpart con-
nected with the primary wave. How-
ever, the connection between the shock
and the primary EUV wave in our case
cannot be identiﬁed by imaging observa-
tions from within the ecliptic plane, which
may be determined by numerical simula-
tions in the future. Additionally, a lat-
eral collision between two streamers is ob-
served (see Figure 3 and its animation),
which suggests that the lateral parts of
the shock probably also collide on the op-
posite side. These results signiﬁcantly im-
prove the understanding of the connection
between an EUV wave and the associated
CME-driven shock on the opposite side of
an eruption.

2. The transmitted EUV wave from the
south-polar CH is accelerated inside
an on-disk low-density dim region with
closed magnetic ﬁelds, besides being ac-
celerated inside the CH. A plausible
coronal cavity without a ﬁlament signa-
ture above the dim region was observed
by SDO/AIA when the dim region was
traversing the east limb. This kind of ac-
celeration inside an on-disk, dim, closed
ﬁeld region has not been reported before
In both
to the best of our knowledge.
the closed ﬁeld region and the CH, the
coronal density is relatively low and the
local characteristic wave speed is high, al-
though the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations
are diﬀerent. This implies that the accel-
eration of an EUV wave can be produced

14

in both open and closed ﬁeld regions as
long as their density is low enough.

3. Part of the primary EUV wavefront turns
around a BP when the wavefront ap-
proaches a ﬁlament channel near the BP.
The BP has a bipolar magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture similar to a small AR, which halts
part of the primary wave that interacts
with the BP. The EUV wave, inside the
low-density ﬁlament channel with a high
characteristic wave speed, is accelerated.
The combination of the halt and the accel-
eration caused by the BP and the ﬁlament
channel eventually changes the direction
of the primary wavefront. Speed eleva-
tion in a coronal cavity hosting a ﬁlament
on the limb has been observed (Liu et al.
2012). Our case demonstrates the eﬀect
of an on-disk ﬁlament channel and a small
bipolar magnetic structure on the propa-
gation of an EUV wave.

4. The primary EUV wavefront is diﬀused
and apparently halted near the bound-
aries of remote ARs located 800 Mm away
from the ﬂare site, and no obvious AR
transmitted secondary waves are observed
beyond the ARs. Chen et al. (2016)
indicate that a fast-mode wave could
be converted to a slow-mode wave and
then be trapped when it passes through
a magnetic quasi-separatrix layer. Of-
man & Thompson (2002) demonstrate
that transportation or dissipation of the
wave energy can be a reason for a faint
AR transmitted wave. The absence of
obvious transmitted secondary waves in
our case is diﬀerent from previous cases
with remote ARs within 400 Mm from the
eruptions (e.g., Li et al. 2012; Shen et al.
2013). This suggests that the intensity of
an AR transmitted secondary wave prob-
ably decreases with the distance of the

probably because the energy intensity of
the EUV wave decreases with distance
due to spread of the wave and/or energy
dissipation.

5. The EUV wave extends to an unprece-
dented scale of ∼360◦ in latitudes, which
is mainly contributed by the polar CH
transmission. The primary EUV wave
persists for about 40 minutes and extends
to ∼180◦ in longitudes before it fades,
even though it is probably restrained by
the ARs on the eastern and western sides
(see Figure 8). The CH transmitted EUV
waves appear ∼15 minutes later than the
primary wave and persist for over 50 min-
utes. The transmitted waves travel along
all meridians and arrive at the opposite
side of the eruption on the Sun (see the
animations of Figures 1 and 8), which is
the major contributor to the unusually
large extent and persistence of the EUV
wave.
If the EUV wave had not been
transmitted by the two polar CHs, the
wave would not have been so persistent
and globalized to a 360◦ scale.
