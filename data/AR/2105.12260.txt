ABSTRACT
We conducted a long-slit spectrophotometry analysis to obtain the chemical abundances of
seven metal-poor H II regions in three galaxies: UM 160, UM 420, and TOL 0513−393.
The data have been taken with the Focal Reducer Low Dispersion Spectrograph 1 (FORS1)
at the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope. We derived the physical conditions and the chemical
abundances of N, O, Ne, S, Ar and Cl. We also performed a detailed analysis that involves
abundance determinations using the 𝑡2 formalism. Based on He I recombination line intensity
ratios, together with the Helio14 code, we derived the abundance of He. In addition, for
a value Δ𝑌 /Δ𝑍𝑂 = 3.3 ± 0.7, we have estimated that the primordial helium abundance by
mass is 𝑌P = 0.2448 ± 0.0033. This value agrees with values derived from Standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis and with other recent determinations of 𝑌P.
Key words: galaxies: abundances — galaxies: individual: UM 160, UM 420, TOL 0513−393

INTRODUCTION

The knowledge of the chemical composition of H II regions is crit-
ical to our current understanding of the chemical composition of
the Universe; precise determinations are of great importance, since
they provide observational restrictions to galactic chemical mod-
els. Examples of these are: the determination of radial abundance
gradients in spiral galaxies; together with other physical properties,
such as mass-luminosity relation, we can study the mass-metallicity
ratio for spiral galaxies, or, with stellar evolution models, we can
study the chemical evolution of galaxies (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004;
Pérez-Montero et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2008; Peimbert & Peimbert
2011; Izotov et al. 2015; Pilyugin et al. 2017; Carigi et al. 2019).
Spectra obtained from H II regions contain emission lines of diﬀer-
ent ions, which belong to elements present in the ionized gas. H and
He are studied by means of recombination lines (RLs), while most
of the heavy elements are studied through collisionally excited lines
(CELs). Typically, CELs have been used to derive heavy element
abundances in H II regions, because they are brighter and easier
to detect than RLs; however, abundances obtained through RLs for
heavy elements are less sensitive to temperature and density, than
abundances obtained from CELs (Tsamis et al. 2003; Esteban et al.
2009).

A known and unresolved problem in the astrophysics of ionized
nebulae relates to the discrepancy between abundances derived from
RLs and those derived from CELs (while assuming constant temper-
ature); the ratio between these abundances is called the abundance
discrepancy factor (ADF García-Rojas & Esteban 2007; García-

Rojas et al. 2013), where abundances determined from RLs are
always higher than those determined from CELs. For H II regions
the ADF is usually between 1.5 and 3 (e.g. García-Rojas & Esteban
2007; Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2017). Several authors have tried
to explain this discrepancy through diﬀerent hypotheses (e.g., Pe-
imbert & Costero 1969; Tsamis & Péquignot 2005; Nicholls et al.
2012; Peimbert et al. 2017), but the debate is still open.

Peimbert (1967) and Peimbert & Costero (1969) ﬁrst developed
the formalism of temperature inhomogeneities (𝑡2), to determine
chemical abundances. This formalism refers to the possibility of in-
cluding thermal inhomogeneities in studies of photoionized regions.
The thermal inhomogeneities usually have a standard deviation of
approximately 20% of the electron temperature (𝜎𝑇 ≈ 20%𝑇𝑒), but
the 𝑡2 value is diﬀerent for each object, however this seemingly small
variation can lead us to underestimate the chemical abundances de-
rived from CELs by a factor of approximately 2 (e.g. García-Rojas
& Esteban 2007; Esteban et al. 2018). Unfortunately it is not pos-
sible to determine a 𝑡2 for all objects (for example, H II galaxies
with high redshift or low intrinsic brightness), and in these cases it
is possible to use an average (cid:10)𝑡2(cid:11) value, obtained from those H II
regions where it is possible to determine 𝑡2 (Peimbert et al. 2012).
Studies of abundances in extragalactic H II regions ﬁnd heavy
element abundances that range from 0.02 Z(cid:12) (e.g., Izotov et al.
2007; Izotov & Thuan 2011; Peimbert et al. 2002, 2012) all the
way up to several times the solar abundance (Toribio San Cipriano
et al. 2017; Esteban et al. 2020). To ﬁnd low metallicity H II re-
gions we need to look at the outer parts of spiral arms of late-type
galaxies, or better yet at irregular-type galaxies; in these regions, the
process of enrichment in heavy elements by stellar nucleosynthesis
has been limited and this provides an opportunity for the study of

the primordial chemical composition (Izotov et al. 2007; Peimbert
et al. 2002, 2012). Furthermore, these regions have undergone little
evolution in their helium abundance, this has the consequence that
the He/H abundance should be close to the primordial value and
therefore help provide restrictions for cosmological theories (Porter
et al. 2009; Izotov et al. 2014; Peimbert et al. 2016). The study of
metal-poor H II regions allows us to understand some astrophysical
processes that occur in the early Universe, which would otherwise
be inaccessible for observation (e.g., Kunth & Östlin 2000; Kni-
azev et al. 2003; Pustilnik & Martin 2007; Brown et al. 2008). We
are interested in objects that have an oxygen abundance smaller or
similar to ∼ 0.1 Z(cid:12) solar, equivalent to 12 + log(O/H) (cid:46) 7.65.

Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert (1974) were the ﬁrst to use ob-
servations of metal-poor H II regions to determine the primordial
helium abundance (𝑌P). Many other studies have been done since,
improving on this ﬁrst determination and showing the diﬃculties
in having an accurate measurement (e.g., Olive & Skillman 2001,
2004; Izotov et al. 2007; Peimbert et al. 2007). A historical re-
view on the determination of the primordial helium abundance was
presented by Peimbert (2008). We currently have the desire to ob-
tain determinations with accuracy better than 1%, since a highly
accurate determination plays an important role to understand the
Universe. In particular, it is desirable to be able to restrict: the Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis models, the physics of elementary particles,
and the study of galactic chemical evolution.

Other recent determinations of the primordial helium abun-
dances using H II regions have been done by Izotov et al. (2014);
Aver et al. (2015); Peimbert et al. (2016); Valerdi et al. (2019); Fer-
nández et al. (2019); Aver et al. (2020); Hsyu et al. (2020); Kurichin
et al. (2021).

In Section 2 we present the observations, as well as a descrip-
tion of the reduction procedure. In Section 3 we show the line in-
tensity corrections due to extinction and underlying absorption. The
determination of physical conditions and of chemical abundances,
ionic and total, are shown in Sections 4 and 5. Finally in Sections 6
and 7 we present the primordial abundance determination and the
conclusions.

2 OBSERVATIONS

Long-slit spectra were obtained with the Focal Reducer Low Dis-
persion Spectrograph 1, FORS1 at the Very Large Telescope Fa-
cility (VLT) in Chile. The slit is 410(cid:48)(cid:48) long and was set to be
0.51(cid:48)(cid:48) wide, for a spectral resolution of ∼1500. We used three grism
settings: GRIS-600B+12, GRIS-600R+14 with ﬁlter GG435, and
GRIS-300V with ﬁlter GG375. Regardless of the air mass value,
the linear atmospheric dispersion corrector was used to keep the
same observed region within the slit. Table 1 shows the resolutions
and wavelength coverage for the emission lines observed with each
grism.

We observed 7 metal-poor H II regions in 3 galaxies: UM 160,

UM 420, and TOL 0513−393.

For galaxy UM 160 (𝛼 = 03ℎ24𝑚23𝑠.1, 𝛿 = −00◦06(cid:48)29(cid:48)(cid:48))

the slit was placed at −106◦.5 with respect to North (see Figure
1). In it, 3 ionized regions are clearly visible (i.e. 3 H II regions).
Each of the H II regions was analyzed independently: it is obvious
that each region will have, its own degree of ionization, its own
ionization zone, potentially diﬀerent chemical compositions, and
diﬀerent temperatures. Region A is 18 pixels (∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48).6) long, region
B is 62 pixels ESE of region A and has a length of 21 pixels (∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48).2),
and region C is 52 pixels ESE of region B and has a length of 13
pixels (∼ 2(cid:48)(cid:48).6).

For galaxy UM 420 (𝛼 = 02ℎ20𝑚54𝑠.5, 𝛿 = 00◦33(cid:48)24(cid:48)(cid:48)) the
slit was placed at −45◦.0 with respect to North. Figure 2 shows
the direct image, it appears to be a single H II region. The lower
right image shows a position velocity diagram that includins H𝛼,
𝜆6548[N II], and 𝜆6583[N II], where it is clear that there are 3
components with diﬀerent velocities. Using the same reasoning,
that we used to divide the photons of UM 160 into 3 regions,
again we decided to divide the photons of UM 420 into 3 regions;
fortunately the diﬀerent velocity components are also separated in
space (mostly). We deﬁned region A to be 14 pixels (∼ 2(cid:48)(cid:48).8) long
and is NE of the center of the galaxy, we deﬁned region B to be
15 pixels (∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48).0) and corresponds to the center of the galaxy, and
region C to be 15 pixels (∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48).0) long and is SW of the center of
the galaxy; all 3 regions directly adjacent to one another.

Finally for galaxy TOL 0513−393 (𝛼 = 05ℎ15𝑚19𝑠.8, 𝛿 =
−39◦17(cid:48)41(cid:48)(cid:48)) the slit was placed at −90◦.0 with respect to North
(see Figure 3). In this galaxy, there is no evidence to suggest multiple
H II regions (and no useful way to separate the observed photons)
so we assumed it is a single 9 pixels (∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48).8) long H II region.

The spectra were reduced using IRAF1, following the standard
procedure: bias subtraction, aperture extraction, ﬂat ﬁeld, and wave-
length calibration. We also corrected eﬀects caused by the medium
between the observer and the object: redshift, underlying absorption
and reddening. For the ﬂux calibration we have used the following
standard stars: LTT 2415, LTT 7389, LTT 7987, and EG 21 (Hamuy
et al. 1992, 1994). We obtained three spectra for each analyzed re-
gion; blue spectra, red spectra, and low-resolution spectra see Table
1. Each spectrum was taken in 3 integrations in order to eliminate
cosmic rays; the total integration time for blue spectra was 36 min-
utes, for red spectra, was 30 minutes, and for low dispersion, it had
a total time of only 6 minutes: we used the low-resolution spectra
to connect the calibration between the red and blue spectra.

3 LINE INTENSITIES AND REDDENING CORRECTION

To measure the emission line ﬂuxes, we used the SPLOT routine
of the IRAF package. We have measured the ﬂux in the line by
integrating all the ﬂux between two given limits and ﬁtted local
continuum which was estimated by eye. When two or more lines
are blended, for example [O II] 𝜆𝜆3726 + 29, we deblended them by
ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles with the same widths and thus estimated
the individual ﬂuxes.

To correct the ﬂuxes for reddening we used the extinction law
of Seaton (1979), with the reddening coeﬃcient 𝑐(H𝛽), which is
obtained by ﬁtting the ﬂux ratios of the brightest Balmer lines as
compared with the theoretical values from the data by Storey &

tronomy, under cooperative agreement with the National Science Founda-
tion.

where 𝐹 (𝜆) is the the absolute ﬂux for each line, 𝐸𝑊 (𝜆) is the
equivalent width observed in 𝜆, 𝐸𝑊abs (𝜆) is the theoretical equiv-
alent width with respect to 𝐸𝑊abs (H𝛽), and 𝜂 is a value very close
to 100.00 and represents a small correction to 𝐼 (H𝛽). There are two
things to note here, the ﬁrst one, related to the theoretical values
of the 𝐼(H I), is that there are small variations on the theoretical
values with temperature and density, however we can not determine
a proper 𝑇𝑒 and 𝑛𝑒 without knowing the line intensities; to be sure
to use the correct values, from an initial value of 𝑇𝑒 and 𝑛𝑒 we deter-
mine the line intensities, and with these we determine 𝑇𝑒 and 𝑛𝑒; we
iterate this procedure until it converges, this is standard procedure.
The second, related to the overall normalization, is not a standard
procedure, instead of normalizing all the lines to 𝐼 (H𝛽) = 100.0; we
decided to normalize the reddening-corrected ﬂuxes to the Balmer
decrement as a whole; this often results in having H𝛽 intensities
slightly diﬀerent than 100.0 (but within 1𝜎), in this case 𝜂. The
decision to present a value of 𝐼 (H𝛽) diﬀerent from 100.0, comes
from the desire to have the best possible determination of the abun-
dances; for example, when we measure the N+ we use 𝐼 (6548) and
𝐼 (6584) simultaneously to include all the available [N II] photons;
for the same reason we do the same for the H I photons. In this
work 𝐼 (H𝛽) = 100.0 represents the best guess at the real value of
𝐼 (H𝛽), based on 8 Balmer lines, and not only on the observed value
of 𝐼 (H𝛽).

Hummer (1995). In addition, we performed an underlying absorp-
tion correction by assuming that 𝐸𝑊abs (𝜆) = 𝐸𝑊abs (H𝛽) × 𝑔(𝜆),
where we used the 𝑔(𝜆) values presented in Peña-Guerrero et al.
(2012); this correction allows us to eliminate the contribution of
dust-scattered starlight; this correction is only necessary for H and
He lines. The reddening and the underlying absorption were ﬁtted
simultaneously using the following equation:

Valerdi, M. et al.

for 𝑛[Fe III]) using the package PyNeb (version 1.1.13) developed
by Luridiana et al. (2015).

For the temperature we used two zone models. We estimated
the temperature of the low-excitation zone, 𝑇low, using: 𝑇[N II]
(𝜆6548+𝜆6383)/𝜆5755, 𝑇[O II] (𝜆3726+𝜆3729)/(𝜆7320+𝜆7330),
and 𝑇[S II] (𝜆6717 + 𝜆6731)/(𝜆4069 + 𝜆4076), and the tempera-
ture of the high-excitation zones, 𝑇high, using: 𝑇[O III] (𝜆4959 +
𝜆5007)/𝜆4363 only. The exception to this is UM 420 A, where no
low excitation temperature was measured; for this object we take
advantage of the correlation between 𝑇[O II] and 𝑇[O III] (see,
for example Izotov et al. 1994; Pérez-Montero & Contini 2009);
these correlation suggests that at 12, 500 K the temperatures are
very similar, and thus we assume 𝑇low = 𝑇[O III]. Overall the tem-
peratures of 7 regions lie in the 9, 500 < 𝑇low < 14, 200 K and
11, 600 < 𝑇high < 15, 400 K ranges; all moderately high temper-
atures, seeking to avoid the complications inherent to the hottest
regions ( 15, 000 (cid:46) 𝑇high (cid:46) 20, 000 K, extremely low metallicity)
as well as the complications produced for larger chemical evolution
corrections (associated with intermediate to high metallicity and
with lower temperatures: 𝑙𝑜𝑔(O/H) + 12 (cid:46) 8.3, 𝑇high (cid:46) 12, 000 K.
All the densities were in the low density limit, frequently with
error bars larger than the determinations themselves, therefore we
determined a single density to represent both zones. We were able
to determine 𝑛[O II] 𝜆3726/𝜆3729 and the 𝑛[S II] 𝜆6717/𝜆6731.
With such low densities it was meaningless to try to determine the
[Cl III] and [Ar IV] densities; their error bars are at least an order
of magnitude larger than the expected density. The other density
at our disposal is the 𝑛[Fe III] 𝐼 (𝜆4986)/𝐼 (𝜆4658) density, from
the computations by Keenan et al. (2001). This ratio is strongly
dependent on density, going from 𝐼 (4986)/𝐼 (4658) ≈ 1.0 at 𝑛𝑒 =
100 cm−3 to 𝐼 (4986)/𝐼 (4658) ≈ 0.05 at 𝑛𝑒 = 3000 cm−3.

4.2 Temperature Fluctuations

We obtain the ionic abundance using two diﬀerent methods: a) the
direct method, and b) the 𝑡2 formalism (Peimbert 1967). The 𝑡2
formalism supposes the temperature in the H II region is inhomo-
geneous in the observed volume (e.g., Peimbert 1967; Peimbert &
Costero 1969; Peimbert et al. 2012).

Temperature inhomogeneities (or the ADF) aﬀect strongly the
abundance determinations for heavy elements, this in turn will aﬀect
the Δ𝑌 /Δ𝑍𝑂 correction to determine 𝑌P. This should not be a very
big correction for two reasons: ﬁrst at higher temperatures the eﬀect
of thermal inhomogeneities tends to be smaller; second for very
low metallicities, even a correction of a factor of two, will be small.
The bigger problem for the 𝑌P determination is a diﬀerence on the
temperature: RLs are brighter on cooler regions, while CELs are
brighter on warmer regions; the diagnostics we obtained on section
§ 4.1 are all from CELs and therefore reﬂect the temperatures present
on the warmer regions, while the H and He RLs represent slightly
cooler regions (regions approximately 1500K cooler than what was
used in section § 4.1); this temperature diﬀerence can result on
over-estimations of 𝑌 and 𝑌P of up to 2% (e.g. Peimbert et al. 2000,
2007).

Unfortunately there is no direct determination of a RLs tem-
perature, or of any ADF for this set of objects. To select the 𝑡2 value,
required for both the ADF correction and the 𝑇CEL −𝑇RL correction,
we used the value recommended by Peimbert et al. (2012). The 𝑡2
value depends on the speciﬁc characteristics of each object, accord-
ing to the degree of ionization of the objects in our sample, we use
the value of 𝑡2 = 0.029 ± 0.004, which corresponds to zone IIa of
ﬁgure 4 of Peimbert et al. (2012).

5 CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES

5.1 Heavy element ionic abundances

We used PyNeb (Luridiana et al. 2015) to estimate the chemical
abundances through the direct method. We adopted two-zone mod-
els characterized by the degree of ionization: low-ionization, where
𝑇low is the mean of 𝑇𝑒([N II]) and 𝑇𝑒([O II]) for singly ionized
heavy elements, and high-ionization, where 𝑇high is 𝑇𝑒([O III]) for
multiple ionized elements.

In addition, we estimated the ionic abundances considering
thermal inhomogeneities with 𝑡2 = 0.029 ± 0.004; these were ob-
tained using the correction to the direct method abundances esti-
mated by the 𝑡2 formalism (Peimbert 1967; Peimbert & Costero
1969):

where 𝛼 = −0.89 is the temperature dependence of H𝛽, Δ𝐸𝑛 is
the diﬀerence of energy between the excited level of the CEL and
the ground level, and 𝑇 (𝜆𝑛𝑚) and 𝑇 (H𝛽) are line temperatures, as
described by Peimbert (1967).

5.2 Helium ionic abundances

To compute the He+ abundance, we use the Helio14 code, which
is described in Peimbert et al. (2012). The code determines the
most likely values for He+/H+, 𝑛𝑒(He I), 𝜏(23𝑆), and 𝑡2(He I);
it uses as input a set of He I/H𝛽 line intensity ratios along with
their uncertainties. Finally, it compares the theoretical ratios to the
observed ones minimizing 𝜒2. The nature of the code requires line
intensities that represent the gaseous phase; similarly to what we did
for the underlying stellar absorption for H I lines, it is important to
consider the correction of the underlying stellar absorption for He I
lines; this absorption is overall about 5 to 20 times smaller for the
He I lines, but since these lines are about 10 times fainter than the
H I lines it is approximately as important; unlike for the H I lines,
the correction is quite diﬀerent for each He I line; we use the results
by González Delgado et al. (1999) to correct lines with 𝜆 < 5000Å
and the results by Peimbert et al. (2005) to correct lines redder than
5876Å. The He+/H+ abundances are presented in Table 5.

To determine the He++ abundance, we use the recombination
He II 𝜆4686 line and the recombination coeﬃcients given by Storey
& Hummer (1995). Table 5 shows the He++/H+ abundance in each
H II region.

5.3 Heavy element total abundances

In general, we can not observe all ionization stages for the elements
present in our objects. To obtain the total abundances, we adopt
commonly used ionization correction factors, ICFs, from the litera-
ture (i.e. Peimbert & Costero 1969; Stasińska 1978; Pérez-Montero
et al. 2007; Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014).

We have obtained the total abundances using ionic abundances
derived from both methods: the direct method and the 𝑡2 formalism.
Table 6 shows both sets of results (for 𝑡2 = 0.00 and for 𝑡2 =
0.029 ± 0.004).

5.4 Total Helium abundance

The main problem to compute the He abundance, is the possible
presence of neutral helium within the H II region; therefore, in
principle, it is necessary to use an ICF(He++He++). In the gen-
eral case, there is not a good way to estimate the ICF(He++He++).
For objects with a low or medium ionization degree, the presence
of neutral helium is important and the ICF(He+ + He++) > 1.00;
for objects with high ionization degree the presence of neutral he-
lium within the nebula can be small and the ICF can be close to
unity (and in the extreme case of very high ionization degree, the
ICF(He+ + He++) (cid:46) 1.00).

Our sample includes only objects with high ionization degree,
and we expect all ICF(He+ + He++) to be within 0.5% of unity and
we will assume ICF(He+ + He++) = 1.00. Table 6 shows the results
for each total abundance in each H II region.

6 PRIMORDIAL HELIUM ABUNDANCE

To determine 𝑌P, we must ﬁrst determine the fraction of helium
by mass. We consider the normalization by unit mass given by
𝑋 + 𝑌 + 𝑍 = 1; where 𝑋 represents hydrogen, 𝑌 represents helium,
and 𝑍 represents the rest of the elements by mass. While we do
know the He/H ratio, we do not know the 𝑌 (nor the 𝑍) value.
However, 𝑍/𝑋 is directly correlated with the fraction of oxygen by
mass, which is in turn correlated with the O/H ratio; we will assume
that the oxygen by mass amounts to 55% ± 10% of the 𝑍 value
(Peimbert et al. 2007).

We use the helium and oxygen abundances (by number) pre-
sented in Table 6 to compute 𝑌 and 𝑍 (by mass). To derive 𝑌𝑃 from
𝑌 , we have to estimate the fraction of helium present in these objects
due to galactic chemical evolution. We use the following equation:

𝑌P = 𝑌 − 𝑍𝑂

Δ𝑌
Δ𝑍𝑂

,

(9)

where 𝑍𝑂 is the fraction of 𝑍 contributed by oxygen (the oxy-
gen abundance by mass), and Δ𝑌 /Δ𝑍𝑂 represents the ratio of the
contributions of helium and oxygen to the ISM from stellar nucle-
osynthesis. We adopted Δ𝑌 /Δ𝑍𝑂 = 3.3 ± 0.7 from Peimbert et al.

(2016), this is very close to the 3.4±1.1 value measured by Kurichin
et al. (2021).

In Table 7, we show the values obtained for each individual
H II region, as well as their errors; we have separated the errors,
presenting ﬁrst the sum of all the statistical errors, and then each
individual systematic errors listed in Peimbert et al. (2007). We
isolate each systematic error in an eﬀort to show the current limit
of this technique and to show that an addition of a large sample
of objects cannot decrease these errors, and in fact poorly chosen
objects, could potentially increase the overall error bars. Also, in
the last rows of Table 7, we present the average of the sample,
ﬁrst separating each individual systematic error, then with all the
systematic errors added together, and ﬁnally with a single total error
bar.

Overall the errors in our measurements will become part of
our statistical errors (line intensities, temperatures, etc.), while the
errors of our astronomical “tools" will be part of our systematic
errors (our reddening function, our chemical evolution correction,
etc.). The reason why systematic errors are not uniform is because
the systematic errors produced by reddening correction, chemical
evolution, and collisional H excitation for any object (or set of
objects) are not uniform; i.e. the eﬀect of a given imperfection on our
tool can give us errors of variable magnitude on our determinations
(e.g. an error in the reddening function could make us over estimate
He/H in all objects, but would have more impact in objects where
the reddening correction is larger).

In Table 8, we compare our 𝑌P determination with recent
H II region 𝑌P determinations in the literature. As comparison,
the result by the Planck Collaboration et al. (2020), corresponds to
𝑌P = 0.24714 ± 0.00050. It is clear that the 𝑌P values derived by
diﬀerent groups provide an important constraint to the Big Bang the-
ory. Most determinations are dominated by systematic errors rather
than statistical ones (of course, it is relatively easy to decrease the
statistical errors increasing the number of objects), on the other hand
there is a lower limit to the systematic error of the best objects of
about ±0.0018 (this value can be slightly larger for very hot objects,
for objects with high metallicity, or for heavily reddened objects).
Our error bar of ±0.0033 is relatively close to this systematic limit.
Following the discussion of section 8 by Valerdi et al. (2019)
the number of neutrino families from this new determination is
2.91±0.22 alternatively the expected neutron mean lifetime amounts
to 872±17 s. Our result of the number of neutrino families, is consis-
tent with previous works (e.g Aver et al. 2015, 2020; Peimbert et al.
2016; Fernández et al. 2019; Valerdi et al. 2019; Hsyu et al. 2020;
Kurichin et al. 2021), and agree with the presence of three neutrino
families, which is consistent with laboratory determinations (e.g.
ALEPH Collaboration et al. 2006; Pattie et al. 2018).

Moreover, our result of the neutron mean lifetime, together
with the results obtained from previous works (e.g Aver et al. 2015,
2020; Peimbert et al. 2016; Fernández et al. 2019; Valerdi et al.
2019; Hsyu et al. 2020; Kurichin et al. 2021), are within 1𝜎 from
the value 𝜏𝑛 = 879.4 ± 0.6 s presented by the Particle Data Group
et al. (2020) from laboratory determinations.

In Figure 4, we show the determinations of the primordial he-
lium abundance using H II regions from 2014 to the present. The 𝑌P
values derived by diﬀerent groups provide an important constraint
to the Big Bang theory. The main source of error is due to systematic
uncertainties. In addition, we include the result derived by Planck
Collaboration et al. (2020) from: the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data, dark energy + cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological
models, and standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) models.

We can see that, other than the work by Izotov (that could be

an overestimation of the primordial helium abundance; Kurichin
et al. 2021), all other 𝑌P determinations derived from H II regions
fall a little bit under the Planck Collaboration determination. This
likely means that the diﬀerences are not statistical. Although these
∼ 0.0020 diﬀerences are consistent with nominal systematic errors,
some of the systematic errors raised since Peimbert et al. (2007)
are associated with individual samples and not the ﬁeld in general
(i.e. each author used diﬀerent characteristics in the determination
of 𝑌P such as: diﬀerent extinction law, collisional contribution to
the H lines, Δ𝑌 /Δ𝑍𝑂 value, etc). Thus, while this diﬀerence can
be explained by a systematic eﬀect in the ﬁeld of H II regions,
the possibility that it comes from the determinations of the SBBN
(implying that the Big Bang is not standard and that there are small

discrepancies in our understanding of physical constants or there is
an ingredient missing in the BBN calculations) cannot be ruled out.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We studied a sample of 7 extragalactic H II regions in three metal-
poor galaxies. We follow the standard analysis to determine physical
conditions and chemical abundances; we also include an analysis
using the 𝑡2 formalism. We focused our work on the helium abun-
dance, to obtain such abundance we use a code dedicated to helium
in a reliable way (Helio14 code).

Once the helium abundance is obtained, we correct by
Δ𝑌 /Δ𝑍𝑂 and estimate the primordial helium abundance, 𝑌P. We

ﬁrst obtained 𝑌P for each of the objects, separating the statistical and
systematic errors, and then we averaged all these determinations to
obtain a single determination of 𝑌P, minimizing the ﬁnal error. Our
ﬁnal primordial helium abundance is 𝑌P = 0.2448 ± 0.0033, which
is consistent with most of the previous estimates obtained using low
metallicity H II regions, as well as with the determination using the
CMB, in Planck Collaboration et al. (2020).

Our 𝑌P determination allows us to estimate the number of neu-
trino families, 𝑁𝜈 = 2.91 ± 0.22 and the neutron half-life value
𝜏𝑛 = 872 ± 17s. Both results are consistent with laboratory de-
terminations (e.g., ALEPH Collaboration et al. 2006; Pattie et al.
2018).

When comparing 𝑌P values determined from H II regions with
those derived from the CMB we ﬁnd a systematic diﬀerence be-
tween both sets of determinations; while the diﬀerence is within the
error bars for each determination, the fact that the last 7 published
determinations of 𝑌P from H II regions fall bellow the CMB deter-
mination suggests these diﬀerences arise from the systematic errors
associated with H II region 𝑌P determinations, but without ruling
out the possibility that it comes from the BBN 𝑌P determinations.
As a ﬁnal note: we want to improve the accuracy of the 𝑌P
determinations. This will require more and better spectra, it will
require to look for objects with smaller than average contribution
to the systematic errors; but, at this point, it also requires better
determinations of the atomic emission of He0 and even a newer
study on the extinction law. If we can achieve all these, it will
increase the reliability of determining the physical parameters of
H II regions as well as of 𝑌P.
