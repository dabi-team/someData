ABSTRACT

Jets often occur repeatedly from almost the same location.

In this paper,

a complex solar jet was observed with two phases to the west of NOAA AR

11513 on July 2nd, 2012. If it had been observed at only moderate resolution,

the two phases and their points of origin would have been regarded as identical.

However, at high resolution we ﬁnd the two phases merge into one another and

the accompanying footpoint brightenings occur at diﬀerent locations. The phases

originate from diﬀerent magnetic patches rather than being one phase originating

from the same patch. Photospheric line of sight (LOS) magnetograms show

that the bases of the two phases lie in two diﬀerent patches of magnetic ﬂux

which decrease in size during the occurrence of the two phases. Based on these

observations, we suggest the driving mechanism of the two successive phases

is magnetic cancellation of two separate magnetic fragments with an opposite

polarity fragment between them.

Introduction

Jets are transient impulsive phenomena with plasma motions along particular directions

(Shibata et al. 1992, 1994; Canﬁeld et al. 1996; Moore et al. 2010; Sterling et al. 2015).

They are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere and occur in active regions, the quiet Sun,

and polar regions (Cirtain et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2014, 2016; Shen et al. 2012; Liu et al.

2014; Hong et al. 2016; Raouaﬁ et al. 2016). The typical length of jets is 10 - 400 Mm, the

width is 5 -100 Mm, and the apparent velocity is 10 - 1000 km s−1 with an average value of

200 km s−1 (Shimojo et al. 1996, 1998).

It is generally believed that solar jets are caused by magnetic reconnection. However,

the jet characteristics largely depend on the magnetic environment at the jet source.

Heyvaerts et al. (1977), Forbes and Priest (1984), Shibata et al. (1992), Moore et al.

(2013) presented a standard model for the formation of a jet. The essential idea of this

model is that at the base of a jet during the emergence of a magnetic arch into an ambient

unipolar ﬁeld, a current sheet forms between the ambient ﬁeld and one leg of the arch with

opposite polarity. During the emergence, the current sheet becomes larger and thinner,

until magnetic reconnection is initiated. Interchange reconnection between closed ﬁeld and

open ﬁeld occurrs at the current sheet. The hot plasma on the open ﬁeld lines escapes

out to become the spire of the jet and the hot plasma on the closed ﬁeld lines is seen as a

bright point at the jet base. This model has been developed further using 2D numerical

experiments by Yokoyama and Shibata (1995, 1996), Nishizuka et al. (2008), Jiang et

al. (2012), and more recently 3D experiments by Moreno-Insertis and Galsgaard (2013),

N´obrega-Siverio et al (2016), Archontis and Hood (2013), Syntelis et al (2015), Raouaﬁ et

al (2016).

Jets are associated with both ﬂux emergence and cancellation (Chae et al. 1999;

Brooks et al. 2007). After new ﬂux has emerged, one or other ﬂux element often cancels

– 4 –

with a nearby one of opposite polarity. Most of them occur in mixed polarity regions

(Shimojo et al. 1996). Jets are commonly associated with magnetic cancellation (Muglach

2008, Young and Muglach 2014a, b, Liu et al. 2011). Jets tend to occur repeatedly (Chifor

at al. 2008; Chen et al. 2015, Liu, et al. 2016) with a period ranging from tens of minutes

to hours. It is normally thought that repeated jets occur at the same location with almost

the same conﬁguration (Guo et al. 2013; Schmieder et al. 2013).

In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, we show that at high resolution a jet can have two

diﬀerent phases involving reconnection of diﬀerent magnetic regions and we propose a

model for such a jet.

Instruments

The observations used in this paper are taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al.

2012) on board the SDO satellite. Full-disk EUV images supplied by the AIA instrument

have a cadence of 12 s and a spatial resolution of 0.6′′. Full solar disk line of sight (LOS)

magnetograms in the photosphere obtained by HMI have a cadence of 45 s and a spatial

resolution of 0.5′′. The aia prep.pro is used to process AIA level 1.5 data and HMI LOS

data. After the reduction of this routine, the data of AIA and HMI will have the same

spatial resolution and the full-disk images will be co-aligned. It is not safe to reach

conclusions about alignment to within 1′′ - 2′′ purely from the default SSW software alone

because of thermal eﬀects that can cause changes in alignment between two diﬀerent

telescopes (Orange et al. 2014). However, in the present study we align HMI and AIA

1600 images over a broader ﬁeld of view (about 100′′ × 100′′), in order to include the region

around the sunspot. This plage does indeed align well with the default SSW alignment,

and so we are conﬁdent about our AIA 171 alignment.

3. Observations and Results

A series of jets was observed on the west edge of AR 11513 on 2012 July 2 (Chen et

al. 2015). A jet with two phases occurring around 22:30 UT is studied. The peak of Phase

1 was around 22:28 UT. Phase 2 followed Phase 1 quickly and the peak was around 22:32

UT. The conﬁgurations of Phase 1 and Phase 2 are shown in Figures 1a and 1d with the

Phase 2-spire being almost parallel to Phase-1 spire. However, the images demonstrate

clearly that the roots of Phase 1 and Phase 2 are located in diﬀerent places. The root of the

Phase 1-spire originates from the southwest of the jet-base, which is marked by R1, while

the root of Phase 2-spire originates from the northeast of the jet-base, which is marked by

R2. The distance between R1 and R2 is around 2.8 Mm. The two spires also appear in

diﬀerent locations: the spire of Phase 2 is to the northeast of Phase 1-spire about 2.8 Mm.

The evolution process from Phase 1 to Phase 2 is shown in the animation. Originally,

there is a bright patch at the jet-base which is located between the negative magnetic

fragment ‘n0’ and the positive fragment ‘p1’ (Figs. 1b and 1g). Then the spire of Phase 1

becomes longer and longer, and also has a lateral motion to the northeast. Around 22:28:11

UT, we can see clearly the jet-spire (Fig. 1c) and the bright patch becomes smaller and

weaker. Around 22:29:23 UT, the root of the jet varies from southwest to northeast. From

this time, Phase 1 changes to Phase 2 and during Phase 2 the jet continually moves to the

northeast laterally. At 22:31:23 UT, there is a bright patch between ‘n0’ and ‘p2’ to the

northeast of the jet-base (Figs. 1e and 1g). At 22:32:11 UT, the whole spire of Phase 2 can

be seen with its root located in the northeast (Figs. 1d and 1f).

At the jet-base, there are mixed magnetic polarity regions. In the middle, there is

a negative magnetic polarity region which is marked by ‘n0’ in Fig. 1g. To the right of

‘n0’, there is a positive magnetic polarity region marked by ‘p1’; to the left of ‘n0’, there

is another positive magnetic polarity region marked by ‘p2’. n0 and p1 had existed for

– 6 –

a long time, but during the occurrence of the jet p1 and n1 decreased, while p2 and n2

ﬂowed out from the penumbra and then moved toward n0. The evolution of the LOS

magnetograms is shown in the animation. The magnetic fragments n0, p1 and p2 are

moving magnetic features. Below the jet the magnetic ﬁeld is continually changing. From

HMI LOS magnetograms in Figs. 1g, 1h and 1i, we can see the way the regions n0, p1 and

p2 are reducing. Combining images from AIA and HMI, we ﬁnd that Phase 1 originates

from a region between the negative polarity region n0 and the positive polarity region p1

while Phase 2 originates from the region between n0 and p2.

In Figure 1, the jet and the bright patches of the footpoints of the two phases are

appear in AIA 171 ˚A. Actually, the jet and the bright patches are seen in six wavelengths:

171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 335 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 131 ˚A. The conﬁgurations of the two phases in AIA 131

˚A are shown in Figure 2; their conﬁgurations are similar to that in 171 ˚A. The normalized

intensity variations of the bright patch (red box in the image 131 ˚A Fig. 2a) in Phase 1

in six wavelengths are shown in Figure 2a. From 22:24 UT to 22:30 UT, there are three

obvious peaks in the six wavelengths. This implies that the bright patch becomes brighter

three times during the growth of Phase 1, and the bright patch has a wide temperature

range as shown in the six wavelengths of AIA. The normalized intensity variation of the

Phase 2 bright patch (red box in the image 131 ˚A, Fig. 2b) in six wavelengths is shown

in Figure 2b. From 22:30 UT to 22:34 UT, the trends of intensity variation are same, and

there is an obvious peak in the diﬀerent wavelengths. The peak time of this bright patch is

the same as Phase 2 of the jet.

In order to know whether there is magnetic cancellation or not, the variation of

magnetic ﬂux is calculated. Figure 3 shows the variation of the magnetic ﬂux in the

rectangular regions including p1 and p2. From Fig. 3a, we can see that the magnetic ﬂux of

p1 decreases from 22:15 UT to 22:24 UT. At 22:26 UT, there is an obvious brightening at

– 7 –

the base of Jet 1. Magnetic cancellation between regions n0 and p1 appears to drive Phase

1. The net increase of magnetic ﬂux of p1 from 22:24 UT to 22:45 UT despite the continued

cancellation is due to two small positive polarity patches (highlighted with two green circles

in Fig. 3b) moving into the p1 region. The variation of magnetic ﬂux in region p2 is shown

in Fig. 2b: it decreases from 22:15 to 22:30. At 22:31 UT, there is a brightening at the base

of the jet, suggesting that ﬂux cancellation between the regions n0 and p2 drives Phase 2.

The motions and magnetic evolution of p1 and p2 are shown in Figure 4. We take a

slit between n0 and p1 (Fig. 4a) and plot a time-distance image (Fig. 4c). Figure 4c shows

there is magnetic cancellation between p1 and n0. The magnetic ﬂux of p1 decreases from

22:00 UT to 23:00 UT. Another slit between p2 and n0 is also taken which is marked by a

green line in Figure 4b. The time-distance image is given in Figure 4d, and shows that p2

moves towards n0 from 22:00 UT to 22:30 UT.

Interpretation and Discussion

The formation and evolution of two successive phases of a jet have been observed here

at high spatial resolution. The two phases overlap in time, with a time between their peaks

of only 4 minutes. The distance between the peaks of Phase 1 and Phase 2 is only 2.8 Mm.

The two patches p1 and p2 are very close, if the spatial resolution were low, they would

not easily be separated from each other. At high resolution we ﬁnd Phases 1 and 2 have

diﬀerent conﬁgurations: the root of Phase 1 is in the southwest, the root of Phase 2 is

in the northeast. The locations of brightening of the feet of two phases are diﬀerent: the

location of the brightening of the footpoint of Phase 1 is between p1 and n0; the location

of brightening of the footpoint of Phase 2 is between p2 and n0. The two phases and the

brightening of their footpoints appear over a wide temperature range. We suggest that the

two phases are driven by magnetic ﬂux cancellation but they originate from diﬀerent nearby

locations rather than originating from the same place.

The jets occurred to the west of NOAA AR 11513 in a moat region surrounding a

sunspot of negative polarity and containing mixed polarity moving magnetic features. Thus

the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is predominantly open and directed away from the sunspot.

Within this ﬁeld, small positive magnetic fragments such as p1 and p2 tend to form closed

ﬂux that is connected to nearby negative fragments. As they move around and come closer

to other negative fragments, cancellation and reconnection naturally occur to form new

connections, jets and heating. Thus, when diﬀerent positive fragments cancel with the

same negative ﬂux they tend to produce jets with successive phases that have similar paths

due to the nature of the ambient ﬁeld. There is also a big coronal hole to the west edge of

NOAA AR 11513 with open negative magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 1 of Chen et al. 2015).

Based on our observation and analysis, we interpret the physical mechanism for the

two successive phases with a two-dimensional sketch (Figure 5). Figure 5a depicts the

magnetic conﬁguration before the jet. It is dominated by an open magnetic ﬁeld with

negative polarity, which is rooted partly in the region n0 in our observation and partly in

n1 and n2. To the right of n0, there is a closed magnetic ﬁeld, with its positive footpoint

p1 linked to part of another nearby negative fragment. On the left side, there is another

closed magnetic structure symmetrically placed with its positive footpoint p2 linking to

part of another nearby negative fragment. During the ﬁrst process of magnetic cancellation

(Figures 5b and 5c), the footpoint motion of p1 and n0 drives magnetic reconnection.

Such magnetic reconnection between open and closed magnetic ﬁeld is called interchange

magnetic reconnection (Moore at al. 2013). The result of the reconnection is to create

new closed magnetic ﬂux between n0 and p1, and new open magnetic ﬂux in the faraway

negative polarity region n1. The hot plasma trapped in the new closed ﬁeld region creates

a bright patch between n0 and p1, and hot plasma escapes out along the new open ﬁeld to

– 9 –

become the spire of Phase 1. The spire is collimated by the dominant strong open magnetic

ﬂux. Heat from the reconnection is magnetically conﬁned to a small volume in the closed

ﬁeld below the reconnection location and so shows up as a brightening, but in the open ﬁeld

above the reconnection site it is spread over a much larger volume and so does not lead

to a brightening in region n1. The continuous magnetic cancellation makes the jet move

sideways. It can be seen, by comparing Fig. 5b and 5c, that the location of the open ﬁeld

line that has just reconnected (and therefore the spire) moves to the left as reconnection

proceeds. This transverse motion can be faster than the photospheric cancellation speed,

since the transverse motion of photospheric sources can lead to a build up of a current sheet

which subsequently reconnects. Phase 2 is driven by the subsequent cancellation between

n0 and p2 (Figure 5d), and produces a spire and a brightening in the same manner as in

Phase 1. It is possible that the two phases are independent of one another, but this is

unlikely since they occur so close in time and space and the spire has a more-or-less smooth

motion, which suggests that the ﬁrst phase helped trigger the second phase or that the

fragments p1 and p2 are not independent but are linked somehow by a common convection

pattern in the moat below the photosphere.

The formation and evolution process of the jet is a process in which magnetic energy

is converted to kinetic energy and thermal energy via magnetic reconnection. From our

observations, we estimate the magnetic energy, kinetic energy and thermal energy. For

Phase 1 during magnetic cancellation from 22:15 UT to 22:24 UT, the magnetic ﬂux

decreases by 1.5(±0.2) × 1018 Mx in about 9 minutes (Fig. 3a), resulting in a mean magnetic

cancellation rate of (2.8 ± 0.3) × 1015 Mx s−1. The length of region p1 is around 6.0 × 108

cm. We calculate the mean magnetic energy release rate during the time of magnetic

cancellation to be (2.8 ± 0.1) × 1027 erg s−1, which is similar to the change of magnetic

energy in a reconnection event described by Li et al. (2016). Following the calculation of

the plasma density and temperature by Liu et al. (2016), the average electron number

– 10 –

density is about 109 cm−3 and the mean temperature is 1.5 MK for the jet. For the bright

patch at the footpoint of the jet, the density is about 2.5 × 109 cm−3 and the temperature

is 4 MK. For the jet, the velocity is about 200 km s−1, the width is about 4 Mm and the

length is about 30 Mm, and we estimate the mass of jet to be 3.7 × 1011 g. The change of

kinetic energy is 7.5 × 1025 erg s−1. Likewise, we estimate the change of thermal energy

of the jet spire, to be 7.8 × 1025 erg s−1. For the bright patch at the footpoint of the jet,

the length is about 8 × 108 cm and the thermal energy 7.1 × 1026 erg s−1. About 30% of

the magnetic energy is converted to kinetic and thermal energy, so the magnetic energy is

suﬃcient to provide the thermal energy and kinetic energy of the jet (more details of the

calculation can be found in the Appendix).

A. Appendix - Energy Estimation

Here, we describe the estimates of magnetic energy, kinetic energy and thermal energy

for Phase 1 of the jet.

The magnetic ﬂux Φ decreases by 1.5(±0.2) × 1018 Mx in about 9 minutes from 22:15

UT to 22:24 UT (Fig. 3a). The magnetic ﬂux density B can be expressed as

B =

Φ
S

,

(A1)

– 11 –

where Φ is the variation of magnetic ﬂux and S the area of magnetic cancellation. The

length of the region p1 (L) is around 6.0 × 108 cm, and we assume the width is one percent

of the length (namely, 6.0 × 106 cm). The variation of magnetic ﬂux density B is around

420 G during the period of magnetic cancellation.

The mean magnetic energy release rate Em during the time of magnetic cancellation

(t) can be written as

Em =

B2
8π × t

V,

(A2)

The length of the region p1 is around 6.0 × 108 cm (L), so the volume V is L3 and Em is
(2.8 ± 0.1) × 1027 erg s−1.

The change of kinetic energy is

Ek =

mv2,

1
2

(A3)

where m is the mass of the accelerated plasma in Phase 1. Here m is set to be

µm0neπL(d/2)2, where µ is the mean molecular weight 0.58 for fully ionized coronal plasma,
m0 is the mass of protons, the width d is about 4 × 108 cm, the length L is about 3 × 109

cm, and ne is the estimated average electron number density of Phase 1. The plasma
density ne for Phase 1 is about 109 cm−3, and the velocity v is about 200 km s−1. Using
these parameters, we obtain the the mass of accelerated plasma in Phase 1 as 3.7 × 1011 g

and the change of kinetic energy as 7.5 × 1025 erg s−1.

The thermal energy of the jet is

Eth = NκpT,

(A4)

where κp is the Boltzmann constant, N = neV is the number of electrons involved in Phase

1, and V is the volume. T is the average temperature, which we take to be 1.5 Mk. The

thermal energy of the jet spire is 7.8 × 1025 erg s−1. For the bright patch at the footpoint

– 12 –

of the jet, the density is about 2.5 × 109 cm−3, the temperature is 4 Mk, and the length is

about 8 × 108 cm, so the thermal energy is 7.1 × 1026 erg.

The mean magnetic energy release rate is 2.8 × 1027 erg s−1, while the sum of the

kinetic energy and thermal energy of the jet spire is 1.5 × 1026 erg, and the thermal energy

of the bright patch at the footpoint is 7.1 × 1026 erg. Thus, about 30% of the magnetic

energy is converted to kinetic and thermal energy.

Note that for the Phase 1 of the jet, the average electron number density 109 cm−3 and

the mean temperature 1.5 MK. For the bright patch at the footpoint of the jet, the density

2.5 × 109 cm−3, and temperature 4 MK are taken from Liu et al. (2016).

Fig. 5.— Schematic of the topology and magnetic reconnection in the two successive phases

of a complex jet showing a few representative ﬁeld lines marked by light-headed arrows

before and after bursts of reconnections. (a) Before reconnection n0 and the outer parts of

n1 and n2 are open magnetic ﬁelds with negative polarity. On the both sides of n0, there

are closed magnetic ﬁelds with positive polarities p1 and p2 linking to the inner parts of the

negative polarities n1 and n2, as shown. Arrows mark the direction of magnetic ﬁeld lines.

(b) Phase 1 of the reconnection process driven by magnetic cancellation between n0 and

p1. Reconnection takes place at the X-point, with plasma velocities shown by solid-headed

arrows. The upwards-moving outﬂow jet from the reconnection site is channeled upwards by

the open ﬁeld lines as a spire. The separatrices and the ﬁeld lines which have reconnected

(a new open ﬁeld line and a new closed ﬁeld line) are marked in red. The location of a

chromospheric brightening is also indicated below the reconnection location and straddling

n0 and p1. (c) Phase 1 continues with more reconnection at the X-point and so creates a

lateral motion of the spire. (d) Phase 2 repeats the same process, but at the X-point on the

left side of n0, driven by magnetic cancellation as p2 approaches n0. The separatrices and

the newly reconnected ﬁeld lines are shown in red.
