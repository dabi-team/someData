Understanding the self-organized ion beam nanopatterning of elemental semiconductors, particularly
silicon, is of intrinsic scientiﬁc and technological interest. This is the second component of a two-
part coherent x-ray scattering and X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) investigation of
the kinetics and ﬂuctuation dynamics of nanoscale ripple development on silicon during 1 keV Ar+
(Part I [18]) and Kr+ bombardment at 65 ◦ polar angle. Here, it’s found that the ion-enhanced
viscous ﬂow relaxation is essentially equal for Kr+-induced patterning as previously found for Ar+
patterning despite the diﬀerence in ion masses. However, the magnitude of the surface curvature-
dependent roughening rate in the early-stage kinetics is larger for Kr+ than for Ar+, consistent with
expectations that the heavier ion gives an increased mass redistributive contribution to the initial
surface instability. As with the Ar+ case, ﬂuctuation dynamics in the late stage show a peak in
correlation times at the length scale corresponding to the dominant structural feature on the surface
- the ripples. Finally, it’s shown that speckle motion during the surface evolution can be analyzed to
determine spatial inhomogeneities in erosion rate and ripple velocity. This allows the direction and
speed of ripple motion to be measured in a real time experiment. In the present case, ripple motion
is found to be into the projected direction of the ion source, in contrast to expectations from an
existing sputter erosion driven model with parameters derived from binary collision approximation
simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Broad beam low energy ion bombardment of surfaces
can lead to the self-organized formation of a remarkable
range of patterns including nanodots [1], nanoscale rip-
ples [2] and nanoscale pits/holes [3], as well as to ul-
trasmoothening [4]. Understanding the nanopatterning
of elemental semiconductors, particularly silicon, is both
foundational for the broader ﬁeld and of intrinsic sci-
entiﬁc and technological interest itself.
In the case of
elemental semiconductors patterned at room tempera-
ture, the surface is amorphized by the ions and oﬀ-axis
bombardment can produce ripple patterns. Competing
theories of self-organized ion beam nanopatterning advo-

believed to play important roles,
including curvature-
dependent sputtering [5–7], lateral mass redistribution
[8], surface diﬀusion [7], ion-enhanced viscous ﬂow [9]
and stress-induced ﬂow [10–14]. Despite extensive study,
there is still not agreement on which processes are dom-
inating surface evolution in a given situation.

This is the second component of a two-part inves-
tigation using X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy
(XPCS) to examine the evolution of average surface
kinetics and surface ﬂuctuation dynamics during room
temperature nanopatterning of silicon by the two most
widely used inert gas ions: Ar+ (Part I) and Kr+ (the
present work). In this Part, we compare observed kinet-
ics and dynamics to that reported for Ar+ ion nanopat-
terning in Part I in order to investigate the eﬀect of
mass within a consistent experimental framework capa-
ble of measuring the coeﬃcients entering linear theory
formalisms. As noted in Part I, the application of XPCS
studies to surface processes is still relatively rare and an

in a custom UHV chamber with mica X-ray windows and
10−7 Torr. Samples were kept at
a base pressure of 5
room temperature and bombarded with a broad beam of
1 keV Kr+ ions generated by a 3-cm graphite-grid ion
source from Veeco Instruments Inc., placed at 65◦ ion
incidence angle (θ), as indicated in Fig. 1. This ion
incidence angle was chosen because it is known to cause
self-organized rippling on the silicon surface [15]. The ion

Real-time coherent Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-
ray Scattering (GISAXS) experiments were performed
at the Coherent Hard X-ray (CHX) beamline at the
National Synchrotron Light Source-II
(NSLS-II) of
Brookhaven National Laboratory. The photon energy of
9.65 keV (wavelength λ = 0.1258 nm) was selected with
1011 photon s−1 and beam
a ﬂux of approximately 5
10 µm2. Experiments used an Eiger-
dimensions 10
X 4M detector (Dectris) with 75 µm pixel size, which
was located 10.3 m from the sample. The incident X-ray
angle αi was 0.3◦, which is slightly above the critical an-
gle of total external reﬂection for silicon of αc = 0.186◦.
The projected incident X-ray beam direction on the sam-
ple was perpendicular to the projected ion beam direc-
tion. This allowed scattering in the GISAXS geometry
to probe the dominant direction of ripple formation for
the chosen ion bombardment angle (
y-direction in the
coordinate system of Fig. 1). The diﬀuse scattering was
recorded as a function of the exit angles αf and ψ using
the 2D detector. The change in X-ray wavevector q can
be calculated from those angles:

Since qx is small, the horizontal component q|| (parallel
to the surface) can be approximated as simply qy and
the vertical component as qz (perpendicular to the sur-
face).
In the analysis of this paper, we will primarily
be interested in the scattering along the Yoneda wing,
which is particularly sensitive to surface structure [16].
For simplicity, we use the term “GISAXS pattern” for
the one-dimensional intensity curve I(q||, t) obtained by
averaging speckles along the Yoneda wing.

It is important to note that the coordinate system con-
vention of Fig. 1 follows that often used for GISAXS
experiments and is therefore rotated 90◦ with respect to
the coordinate system typically used in the ion bombard-
ment literature. Thus, in these experiments ”parallel-
mode” ripples form with their wavevector pointing in
the y-direction rather than in the x-direction, as would
conventionally be the situation in studies of ion beam
nanopatterning.

FIG. 1.
Schematic diagram of the GISAXS experiment.
The ion source is placed at the polar angle θ, which causes
self-organized rippling on the silicon surface. The sample is
positioned so that the X-ray incident angle αi is slightly above
the critical angle of total external reﬂection. The scattering
is recorded as a function of the exit angles αf and ψ using a
2D detector.

important goal of this work is also to explore the capabili-
ties of the technique. In this Part we implement an XPCS
approach which allows us to measure in real time the di-
rection and speed of propagation of the self-organized rip-
ples on the surface, driven by continued bombardment.
The ripple velocity is a fundamental parameter predicted
by competing theories, but its measurement has previ-
ously been challenging.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In Sect. II below
we describe the methods used in the experiments and
simulations. Section III provides a broad brush overview
of the basic behavior observed in the speckle-averaged
x-ray intensity evolution during nano-ripple formation.
The early stages of the patterning process are analyzed
in Sect.
IV to determine the linear theory coeﬃcients
which are compared with theoretical predictions and with
results from Ar+ nanopatterning. Section V examines
the late-stage coarsening kinetics in both experiment and
simulation while the evolution of ﬂuctuation dynamics is
examined in Sect. VI. Section VII presents the mea-
surement of ripple velocity while the results and their
implications are discussed in Sect. VIII.

As in Part I of this study, experiments utilized 640
1 cm2
µm thick p-doped (B) Si(100) wafers cut into 1
pieces and cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and
methanol. Samples were ﬁrmly aﬃxed to a stage by In-
dium bonding. To prevent sputtering of impurities onto
the surface, the sample stage geometry was designed to
ensure that nothing was above the sample surface. The

AFM topographs were made of the sample; these show
the development of nanoscale ripples (Fig. 2). In order
to quantitatively compare the topographs with the X-
ray experiments, the predicted GISAXS scattering pat-
terns from the topographs were calculated based on an
equation of Sinha et al. [17], as described in the present
work’s companion paper (Part I [18]). This approach

In Sect.

In the experiments, ion bombardment started at t =
0 s (after 100 s of static scan), and a clear correlation
peak can be seen growing around t = 200 s due to the
formation of correlated ripples on the surface. The ini-

tial peak wavenumber is at q0
initial ripple wavelength is approximately 2π/0.26 nm−1

lyze this behavior using linear theory of nanopatterning.
A typical detector pattern and GISAXS intensity pat-
terns at particular times in the evolution are shown in
Fig. 3. After the initial ripple formation, coarsening oc-
curs with the correlation peak position

smaller wave number. The coarsening proceeds at an ever
decreasing rate and, by the end of the experiment, the
average GISAXS pattern changes only slowly; the ﬁnal

position was approximately 2π/0.23 nm−1

IV. SPECKLE-AVERAGED EARLY-TIME
KINETICS

As discussed in Part I, at early stages of nanopattern-
ing, when surface slopes are small, a linear stability anal-
ysis can be applied to determine some of the coeﬃcients
in theories attempting to describe the process. This lin-
ear theory applied to surface evolution during ion bom-
bardment takes the form [7]:

∂˜h (q, t)
∂t

= R (q) ˜h (q, t) + ˜η (q, t)

(2)

where ˜h (q, t) is the Fourier transform of the surface
height h (r, t), R (q) is the ampliﬁcation factor, and
˜η (q, t) is the Fourier transform of a stochastic noise. The
ampliﬁcation factor can be determined experimentally by
measuring the speckle-averaged height-height structure
factor evolution [19, 20]:

Comparisons between the ﬁt parameter results found

suggesting that the deposited energy is more impor-
tant in determining viscous ﬂow than is the momentum.
Moreover, as discussed in Part I, this magnitude of ion-
enhanced viscous ﬂow is consistent with previous mea-
surements and with expectations if the eﬀective viscosity
is inversely proportional to ion ﬂux, as discussed in Norris
et al. [20].

V. SPECKLE-AVERAGED LATE-TIME
KINETICS AND POST FACTO AFM

With time, the ripple correlation peaks shift inward
with an ever decreasing rate, showing that the spatial
structure coarsens. Beyond t = 1000 s, the GISAXS pat-
tern changes very little - the peak moves only a few pix-
els as shown in Fig. 5. While the range of time scales
available is too limited to make a deﬁnitive statement
about the nature of the relaxation, the peak motion can
be ﬁt as a weak power law evolution. At late times,
it’s well known that the ripples begin to form asymmet-
ric sawtooth structures. As a result, the scattering pat-
tern becomes asymmetric [26, 27]. Here it’s observed in
Fig. 3 that the correlation peak at +q0 grows slightly
q0. More insight comes from the
higher than the one at
post facto AFM topograph, which shows the asymmetric
structure, as evidenced by the cut through the topograph
and the slope analysis shown inthe slope analysis shown
in Fig. 2. The slope analysis also shows that the positive
slopes are more uniform in angle distribution than are
the negative slopes.

−

Simple calculations of the scattering expected from a
sawtooth structure show that, if the positive terrace slope
is larger in magnitude than the negative terrace slope on
the structure, the positive q|| peak should be higher, as
observed. In this case, the negative terrace slope is facing
the incoming ion beam. Such calculations also show that
2q0, with the peak at
harmonic peaks should exist at
2q0 higher than the one at +2q0. While the harmonic
−
peaks are oﬀ the detector, the increase in intensity on
each side of the detector is leading up to them, with the
increase higher on the negative side as expected from the
calculations.

VI. SPECKLE CORRELATION STUDY OF
FLUCTUATION DYNAMICS

Although the speckle-averaged GISAXS pattern shows
the average kinetics, the strength of coherent experiments
lies in their ability to measure temporal correlations of
the detailed speckle pattern, illuminating the underlying
ﬂuctuation dynamics. The two-time correlation function
(TTCF) measures how the structure on a given length
scale changes between time t1 and time t2 as the sample
evolves:

C(q||, t1, t2) =

(cid:10)I(q||, t1)I(q||, t2)(cid:11)
(cid:10)I(q||, t1)(cid:11) (cid:10)I(q||, t2)(cid:11)

(5)

where the angular brackets denote an average over equiv-
alent q|| values and the denominator values can be con-
sidered as speckle-averaged intensities one would have
obtained using non-coherent scattering.

TTCF’s are shown in Fig. 6 for a wavenumber q|| near
the scattering peak. The central diagonal ridge of corre-
lation going from the bottom left to top right indicates

for Kr+ and Ar+ shows that the diﬀering curvature coef-
ﬁcient Sy between the two ions is the factor determining
the diﬀerence in initial ripple length scales. In particu-
lar, the magnitude of the (negative) curvature coeﬃcient
increases on going from Ar+ to Kr+.

For theoretical comparison with the measured Sy, we
examine the erosive formalism of Bradley and Harper
[7] and the redistributive formulism of Carter and Vish-
nyakov [8], while acknowledging that stress-driven the-
ories oﬀer competing views [10–14]. The erosive and
redistributive contributions to Sy can be estimated fol-
lowing the general approaches of Bobes et al.
[21] and
Hofs¨ass [22] using SDTrimSP [23] binary collision approx-
imation simulations. These give an erosive contribution

worthy, that these theoretical values of Sy show the
same trend as the experiment in going from the Ar+
projectile (discussed in Part I of this work) to Kr+.
The calculations suggest that the key diﬀerence in the

apparent contrast approaches its limiting value. Finally,
to improve statistics for the ﬁts to Eq. 6, results from
±
10 s around the central mean growth time T were chosen
for averaging.

Figure 7 shows the evolution of τ (q||) and n(q||) for
selected wavenumbers. Near the peak wavenumber q0,
τ (q||) increases continuously. The exponent n(q||) rapidly
increases from approximately one, indicative of simple
exponential decay, to a value of 1.6-1.8, showing com-
pressed exponential behavior. Away from q0, the τ (q||)
values initially increase but then seem to relax to a steady
state.

Figure 8 complements Fig. 7 by showing the behavior
of τ (q||) for selected times. It’s seen that the τ (q||) values
near the scattering peaks
q0 grow strongly to become
±
much larger than the relaxation times at other wavenum-
bers. Starting at T = 852 s, it is observed that τ (q||) is
asymmetric, being higher at +q0 than at

q0.

More detail can be obtained from averaging over larger

the high correlation expected for t1
t2. One way to un-
derstand how a surface changes on a given length scale is
by observing the width of the central correlation ridge,
which is a measure of correlation time on the surface. As
seen in Fig. 6, near q0, the width increases continuously
during the experiment. However, as discussed below, at
wavenumbers away from q0, the TTCF width initially in-
creases rapidly but gradually approaches an approximate

Quantitative measurement of the evolving dynamics is
made by taking diagonal cuts through the central ridge at
a constant average bombardment time T = (t1 + t2)/2 as
a function of ∆t =

where τ (q||) is the ﬁt correlation time, and n(q||) is a ﬁt
exponent which shows whether the relaxation is a simple
(n = 1), stretched (0 < n < 1), or compressed (n > 1)
exponential. b is the baseline, which was set as 1 or al-
lowed to vary between 0.9 - 1.1. β(q||) describes the con-
trast, which depends on experimental factors including
the eﬀective resolution of the experiment. The magni-
tude of the central diagonal ridge of correlations in Fig.
6 increases with time, indicating an increasing contrast.
This is probably because background incoherent scatter-
ing (e.g. from slits or windows) causes the apparent con-
trast to decrease at early times when the scattering from
the sample is relatively small. As ripples form on the
sample, the scattering from the sample increases and the

pliﬁed. Now it is more evident that the correlation time
τ (q||) is asymmetric. The asymmetry is in the the oppo-
site direction of the relative peak intensities. In addition,
from the upturn in τ (q||) near the detector edges, it ap-
pears that there is also a peak in τ (q||) at the harmonic
2q0. Near the primary peaks, n(q||) > 1, so that

the relaxation is compressed exponential, as noted be-
fore. At higher values of q||, n(q||) decreases to below
one, indicative of stretched exponential behavior. All of
these behaviors are similar to those observed in Part I of
this work for Ar+ nanopatterning of Si.

VII. RIPPLE VELOCITY ANALYSIS

Following their self-organized growth, ripples can move
across the surface, driven by the continued ion bombard-
ment [29]. For uniform motion of waves or a uniform ﬂow
pattern, homodyne X-ray scattering cannot detect the
motion except perhaps due to small edge eﬀects. How-
ever, following the work of Lhermitte et al. with ﬂuid ﬂow
[30], we have shown in Mokhtarzadeh et al. [31] that the
ripple ﬂow can be measured as systematic speckle motion
on the detector if the ripple velocity ﬁeld is inhomoge-
neous.

For self-organized silicon nanopatterning at room tem-
perature, surface evolution is driven by the ion beam, so

FIG. 7. KWW equation ﬁt results for diagonal slices through the TTCF’s during nanopatterning. During the time period
shown, the peak position decreases from q0 ≈ 0.25 nm=−1 to q0 ≈ 0.22 nm−1. Left: Evolution of correlation time τ (q||).
Right: Evolution of exponent n(q||) at wavenumber q0 = 0.21 nm−1. Diﬀerent adjacent time averaging was performed here to
highlight the quick transition of n(q||) from 1 to a value of 1.6-1.8.

FIG. 8. Plots of τ (q||) at diﬀerent bombardment times T obtained from the KWW ﬁts of TTCF diagonal cuts. Near the
origin, the correlation times can be unreliable due to overlap between the scattered signal and the tail of the specular reﬂection.
The ﬁt value of τ at the origin is quite high, perhaps as a result of this.

the local ripple velocity is expected to be proportional
to the local ion ﬂux. The contribution to the velocity of
ripples due to angle-dependent sputter erosion is [7, 29]:

vy(θ) =

F Ω

(cid:21)

Y (θ) sin θ

(8)

where Y (θ) is the angle-dependent sputter yield, F is the
ion ﬂux and Ω is the atomic volume. The accuracy of Eq.
8 has been the subject of some controversy. Given typical
shapes of the sputter yield Y (θ), Eq. 8 predicts that
there is a cross-over bombardment angle θc, below which
ripples move into the projected direction of the ion beam,
and above which they move away from the ion beam.
The exact value of θc depends sensitively on the detailed
form of Y (θ). A number of FIB/SEM studies using Ga+
ions have found ripple motion in the opposite direction to

what is expected from the equation [29, 32–35]. However,
Hofs¨ass et al. [36] measured the ripple velocity during 10
keV Xe+ irradiation of Si using fabricated marker grooves
with ex situ SEM and found the predicted transition from
ripple movement into the beam to the opposite direction
with increasing bombardment angle.

If the ion ﬂux F is inhomogeneous, then Eq. 8 shows
that the ripple velocity is as well. For the present studies,
a highly focused 10 x 10 µm2 X-ray beam was used. How-
ever, in the coordinate system of Fig. 1, the X-ray foot-
print on the sample is elongated by a factor of 200 in the
x-direction by the grazing incidence geometry. There-
fore, given the small size of the x-ray beam, only the
variation in ion intensity along the x-direction is impor-
tant. In earlier work [31] we had examined the case in
which the ion beam is centered within the x-ray footprint.

FIG. 9. Fit values of correlation time τ (q||) (left) and exponent n(q||) (right) for selected bombardment times T with larger
time averaging and use of the autocorrelation function in Eq. 7. For comparison, the GISAXS pattern is shown on a logarithmic
intensity scale.

That presented complexities however, which limited our
ability to deﬁnitively analyze the results. In the present
experiment, the center of the x-ray beam is outside the
x-ray footprint and we can successfully analyze the re-
sulting data assuming a simple uniform gradient of ion
ﬂux in the x-direction, and thus a uniform gradient in
ripple velocity vy(x) in the ﬂow pattern sampled by the
x-ray footprint. A second eﬀect of a gradient in ion ﬂux
is an x-gradient in the erosion rate of the material vz(x).
Note that, in the coordinate system of Fig. 1, the erosion
velocity is negative. It is related to the sputter yield by
vz(x) =

F (x)ΩY (θ) cos θ.

In general, a uniform gradient in velocity can be writ-

dependent) x-gradient in the ripple velocity and Γz(t) =
∆vz(x, t)/∆x is the (time-dependent) gradient in (nega-
tive) erosion velocity.

On the detector, speckle motion in the x-direction
shows as vertical movement.
Indeed, as discussed be-
low, this behavior is observed in the data and supports
the supposition that there is a simple unidirectional gra-
dient of ion ﬂux across the footprint of the X-ray beam in
the x-direction. This is also an important diﬀerence from
our earlier work of Ref. [31] in which a highly focused ion
beam was used so that the X-ray beam straddled both
sides of the ion beam distribution. As shown below, the
present experimental arrangement allows us to determine
both the direction and speed of the surface ripples.

In order to track speckle motion with time, cross cor-
relations within a region of interest on the detector at

As shown in the bottom of Fig. 10, speckles move
vertically upward on the right side of the detector (i.e.
for positive q||) and vertically downward on the left side
(i.e. for negative q||). There is no horizontal movement.
To determine the Γy and Γz parameters, the observed
speckle motions were used to calculate dqx/dt. Since the
x-component of the photon wavevector, kx, is conserved
across the material surface, calculation of qx using Eq.
1 simply uses the geometric scattering angles without
refraction eﬀects. Figure 11 shows that the magnitude

The negative sign of Γy shows that the negative gra-

increasing x-coordinate. As shown in Fig. 13, this is
only possible if the ion ﬂux causes the ripples to move in
the positive y-direction, i.e. in the direction heading into
the oncoming ion beam. Thus the the ion bombardment
angle θ = 65◦ is found to be below the transition angle

VIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Comparison of the present results from Kr+ nanopat-
terning of Si with those from Ar+ nanopatterning pre-
sented in Part I is instructive. As noted in Sect. IV, the
ion enhanced viscous ﬂow relaxation in the two cases is
essentially equal. Thus the change in ion mass at con-
stant energy does not seem to eﬀect the activation of
such relaxation mechanisms. The curvature-dependent
term, however, increases in magnitude in going from Ar+
to Kr+ in a manner consistent with expectations for in-
creased lateral mass redistributive processes for the heav-
ier ion with its larger momentum.

As found also for Ar+ nanopatterning in Part I of this
work, there are strong relationships between the corre-
lation time τ (q) and the surface structure as measured
by the scattering pattern. Figure 9 shows that, near the
q0, the scattering intensity initially
peak wavenumbers
grows much more rapidly than does the correlation time
τ , but that at later times the intensity grows only slowly
while τ continues to grow signiﬁcantly.

±

Beyond the initial ripple growth process, the relaxation
of ﬂuctuations is found to be compressed exponential
near the peak wavenumber q0 and stretched exponential
at higher wavenumbers
. As discussed Ref. [38] and
in Part I of the study, compressed exponential behavior
at short times ∆t in both soft materials [39] and metal-
lic glasses [40] has been attributed to collective ballistic
ﬂow of local structures due to internal stress relaxation.

FIG. 13. Explanation of the determination of ripple velocity
direction. Red vectors are ripple velocities with negative Γy =
∆vy/∆x. The measured positive Γz value means that ion ﬂux
F decreases with increasing x-coordinate as shown with the
gradient in grey scale. Since ﬂux F ∝ |vy|, only Option 1 is
possible.

To gain further insight, we take advantage of the struc-
ture of Eq. 11 to isolate the eﬀects of the two diﬀerent
parameters Γy(t) and Γz(t) by adding and subtracting
motion dqx/dt at pairs of detector points having equal qz
but opposite q||:

Figure 12 shows that the magnitude of the diﬀerence in
dqx/dt between the two sides decreases steadily during
the experiment, clearly indicating that the magnitude of
the gradient velocity Γy(t) = ∆vy(x, t)/∆x is decreas-
ing with time. The summed dqx/dt is noisier, but its
magnitude is also decreasing throughout the experiment,
suggesting that Γz(t) = ∆vz(x, t)/∆x is also decreasing.
As seen in Eq. 8, the ripple velocity is proportional to
the ion ﬂux so the most prosaic explanation for these ob-
servations is that the ion ﬂux proﬁle F (x) is changing
slightly over time, becoming more uniform. This expla-

laxation as a driving force [10–14]. These might provide
a direct connection between the compressed exponential
behavior of ion beam nanopatterning observed here and
that observed in glasses.

A signiﬁcant step forward in the present work has been
the demonstration of using speckle motion to reveal de-
tailed information about the sputter erosion rate and rip-
ple velocity. The approach developed here is a real-time
measurement applicable to surfaces with even short rip-
ple wavelengths, and oﬀers the possibility of wide ap-
plicability. Higher accuracy could likely be achieved by
using a larger ﬂux gradient.

For the particular case of self-organized Si rippling by 1
keV Kr+ bombardment, this study ﬁnds that the ion in-
cidence angle of 65◦ is below the transition angle of ripple
velocity θc. Calculation of Eq. 8 using Y (θ) values from
58◦,
SDTrimSP gives a predicted transition angle θc
in conﬂict with the measurement. In addition, for angles
below θc, use of SDTrimSP Y (θ) values in Eq. 8 gives a
maximum ripple velocity that is approximately an order
of magnitude smaller than the velocity measured here.
In light of these results it is noteworthy that the ripple
motion measurements of Hofs¨ass et al.
[36] for 10 keV
Xe+ patterning of Si, found that the experimental θc was
also slightly higher than predicted by Eq. 8 and found
a speed at θ = 62◦ that was larger than the maximum
predicted for θ < θc.

≈

In some theories, stress eﬀects play a signiﬁcant role in
determining the ripple velocity [41]. It may be possible
that their inclusion would produce better agreement with
experiment, though the relevant example calculations of
[41] would seem to decrease, rather than increase,
Ref.

11

the transition angle θc. It would be quite interesting to
investigate this further with measurements at multiple
ion incidence angles. In addition, it’s believed that the
ripple velocity may change, and possibly reverse sign,
as sawtooth patterns evolve at later bombardment times
than those examined in this study [42]. The real-time
nature of the speckle motion technique developed here
would be ideal to investigate the existence and nature of
such behavior.
