Characterizing quasibound states from coupled-channel scattering calculations can be a laborious
task, involving extensive manual iteration and ﬁtting. We present an automated procedure, based on
the phase shift or S-matrix eigenphase sum, that reliably converges on a quasibound state (or scat-
tering resonance) from some distance away. It may be used for both single-channel and multichannel
scattering. It produces the energy and width of the state and the phase shift of the background
scattering, and hence the lifetime of the state. It also allows extraction of partial widths for decay to
individual open channels. We demonstrate the method on a very narrow state in the Van der Waals
complex Ar–H2, which decays only by vibrational predissociation, and on near-threshold states of
85Rb2, whose lifetime varies over 4 orders of magnitude as a function of magnetic ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Scattering resonances are important in many areas of
physics and chemistry. These include nuclear physics [1],
electron scattering from atoms [2] and molecules [3], the
spectroscopy of Van der Waals complexes [4] and chem-
ical reaction dynamics [5]. They have manifestations in
both spectroscopy and collisions, and describe both the
decay properties of a quasibound state and the resonant
scattering that occurs at energies close to the state.

Zero-energy Feshbach resonances are particularly im-
portant in ultracold atomic and molecular physics [6]. It
is often possible to tune a near-threshold state across a
scattering threshold with an external (usually magnetic)
ﬁeld. In this case the resonance properties are usually ob-
served as a function of ﬁeld at essentially constant near-
zero energy. Magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances
have been used both to control atomic interactions via
the scattering length and to create diatomic molecules
by magnetoassociation [7].

When there is a single open channel, the scatter-
ing phase shift δ(E) increases by π across a resonance.
Around an isolated narrow resonance it follows the Breit-
Wigner form as a function of energy,

δ(E) = δbg − arctan

(cid:18) Γ/2

E − Eres

(cid:19)

,

(1)

where Eres is the resonance energy, Γ is its width, and δbg
is the background phase shift. The lifetime of the corre-
sponding quasibound state is τ = ¯h/Γ. In multichannel
scattering, the same behavior is shown by the eigenphase
sum [4], which is the sum of the phases of the eigenvalues
of the scattering S matrix, which all have magnitude 1.
Individual S-matrix elements, however, show more com-
plicated behavior.

Scattering resonances are laborious to locate and char-
acterize in scattering calculations.
It is usually neces-
sary to carry out calculations on a grid of energies across
the resonance and ﬁt the resulting phase shifts or eigen-
phase sums to Eq. (1) [4]. The width of the resonance
is not usually evident until quite late in the process, so

many manual iterations are often needed.
In addition,
the phase shift can usually be calculated only modulo
π, and it is easy to miss a narrow resonance entirely if
the grid used is too coarse. As an extreme example of
this, some vibrational predissociation resonances in the
Van der Waals complexes Ar–H2 and Ar–D2 are less than
10−9 cm−1 wide [8], and occur at energies thousands of
cm−1 above some of their dissociation channels. Locat-
ing such resonances in order to characterize them can be
very challenging.

The purpose of this paper is to describe an automated
procedure for converging on and characterizing reso-
nances, using coupled-channel calculations of the phase
shift or S matrix. Once the location is approximately
known, the procedure can often characterize the reso-
nance position, width and background phase shift with
calculations at fewer than 10 energies, without the need
for manual intervention. We will describe our method
in terms of the phase shift, but it applies equally to the
eigenphase sum.

II. THEORY

The Breit-Wigner functional form, Eq. (1), has three
unknowns, and thus we need the value of δ(E) at a mini-
mum of three energies to characterise the resonance. We
ﬁrst deﬁne the dimensionless quantity (cid:101)a(E) = tan δ(E).
This has a pole near the resonance position and Eq. (1)
can be rewritten as

(cid:101)a(E) = tan δbg −

The quantities (cid:101)abg, (cid:101)∆, and (cid:101)Eres do not have immediate
physical meaning, but they put Eq. (1) into a form (2)
that is more convenient for numerical solution.

Our numerical procedure is to evaluate the phase shift
(or eigenphase sum) δ(E) from coupled-channel scatter-
ing calculations at three energies E1, E2 and E3 to obtain
the corresponding values (cid:101)a1, (cid:101)a2 and (cid:101)a3. Solving 3 simul-
taneous equations allows us to extract (cid:101)abg, (cid:101)∆, and (cid:101)Eres.

Eqs. (4) to (7) and (3) allow us to estimate the position,
width and background phase shift of the resonance from
three points in its vicinity. However, the estimates be-

verge on the resonance simply by generating a sequence
of points that approach closer and closer to Eres. Instead
we aim to generate a ﬁnal set of three points, one near
Eres and two others at distances away from it comparable
to the resonance width. In the present paper, we converge
the central point upon Eres. One of the outer points is
placed about Γtlo from Eres (with tolerance ±ξΓtlo), and
the other is about Γthi from it (with tolerance ±ξΓthi).
The three points can be regarded as allowing characteri-
zation of Eres, Γ, and δbg, respectively. The logic we use
to select which point to discard and where to place the
next point is shown in Fig. 1. We terminate the itera-
tion when the estimated value of Eres is within a small
amount (cid:15) of the closest of the 3 points and the other two
points satisfy the criteria above.

The algorithm shown in Fig. 1 is similar to the one
we presented previously for converging on a zero-energy
Feshbach resonance in the scattering length as a function
of external ﬁeld [9]. However, it allows better control
of the placement of the ﬁnal points and improves the
sequence of points close to convergence. It is beneﬁcial
in combination with the procedures of ref. [9] as well as
for the present purpose.

The spacings tlo and thi are signed, with |tlo| ≤ |thi|.
The values tlo = −0.1, thi = 1.0 and ξ = 0.25 are usually
appropriate for characterization of isolated resonances,
and are used in the present work. However, for special
purposes, it may be necessary to use diﬀerent choices of
the points. Larger values of tlo and thi are sometimes

2

needed for very narrow resonances, to reduce the eﬀects
of numerical noise, and smaller values may be needed for
very wide resonances, to reduce variation in δbg across the
range. For overlapping resonances, it may be desirable
to place both outer points on the same side of Eres.

We need three energies in the vicinity of the reso-
nance to start the procedure. We choose to use equally
spaced points separated by a small amount δE, based on
a physical estimate of the resonance width. The initial
estimate of the resonance position could come from var-
ious sources, including approximate calculations or ex-
perimental measurements; we usually use the program
bound [10, 11], which solves the coupled-channel prob-
lem subject to bound-state boundary conditions.

The algorithms described here make the approxima-
tion that δbg(E) is constant across the range of points.
This approximation improves as the convergence pro-
ceeds and the range of points becomes smaller. Neverthe-
less, it is the limiting factor that determines the distance
from which convergence can be achieved. At least one of
the initial points must give a phase shift that is aﬀected
by the resonance by more than the variation of δbg(E)
across the range of the points. For very narrow reso-
nances, computational noise in the phase shift can also
aﬀect convergence.

III. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

A. Vibrational predissociation of Ar–H2

The ﬁrst example we use to demonstrate this method is
vibrational predissociation of the Van der Waals complex
Ar–H2. The state with H2 vibrational quantum number
v = 1, rotation j = 0 and total angular momentum J = 0
lies about 4100 cm−1 above the ground state and can
predissociate to form H2, v = 0, j ≤ 8. We use the inter-
action potential of Le Roy and Carley [12], and perform
close-coupled scattering calculations using the molscat
package [11, 13] to evaluate the S matrix and its eigen-
phase sum as a function of energy. We use a space-ﬁxed
basis set that includes all functions with j ≤ 10 for v = 0
and with j ≤ 8 for v = 1 and solve the coupled equa-
tions using the symplectic log-derivative propagator of
Manolopoulos and Gray [14] with the six-step ﬁfth-order
symplectic integrator of McLachlan and Atela [15].

This

state has previously been characterized in
coupled-channel calculations [8], but the purpose of this
example is to show the eﬃciency of the present method.
We locate the resonance that describes this state at
E = 4139.075 cm−1 with respect to the threshold with
v = 0, j = 0. We ﬁnd a width Γ = 2.02 × 10−8 cm−1, in
agreement with the result reported in Ref. [8]. The de-
cay is very slow because the interaction potential includes
only low-order anisotropy and the nearest open channel,
with j = 8, is only indirectly coupled to the bound state.
Open channels with lower j are more directly coupled to
the bound state, but decay to them releases more kinetic

Table I shows the sequence of points En generated by
our procedure and how the successive estimates converge
on the resonance parameters. Further details of the logic
used at each step are given in the program output in

Supplemental Material [16]. To demonstrate the power
of the method, we have purposefully picked an initial es-
timate that is further from the resonance than the best
estimates from bound-state calculations. Our method

104 widths away and characterizes it using a total of only
11 calculations.
In this case, as is usual, each point is
based on the three immediately preceding points. Most
of the calculations are used to converge on the resonance
position Eres. Only calculations 9 and 10 are placed away
from the predicted resonance energy before the ﬁnal cal-
culation is placed very close the resonance energy.

We have also characterized the same state using the
improved interaction potential of Le Roy and Hutson
[17]. In this case we ﬁnd the resonance at E = 4138.884
cm−1, with width Γ = 9.4 × 10−10 cm−1, which is a fac-
tor of about 20 narrower than for the potential of Le
Roy and Carley [12]. The potential coupling terms re-
sponsible for vibrational predissociation are anisotropic
terms oﬀ-diagonal in the H2 vibrational quantum num-
ber, and these are dominated by the coeﬃcient Vλk(R)
with λ = 2 and k = 1 in the potential expansion of Refs.
[12] and [17]. Figure 3 of Ref. [17] shows that this coeﬃ-
cient is signiﬁcantly weaker for the potential of Ref. [17]
than for that of Ref. [12], and this is responsible for the
decreased width.

B. Lifetimes of 85Rb2 Feshbach molecules

The second example is for 85Rb2 molecules produced
by magnetoassociation at the (f, mf ) = (2, −2) + (2, −2)
threshold [18]. This is not the lowest threshold for 85Rb
atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld, so the molecules can decay to
lower thresholds in which one or both of the atoms has
mf > −2. The Feshbach resonance used for magnetoas-
sociation at a magnetic ﬁeld near 155 G is caused by a
state that has a lifetime around 82 µs at energies well
below the (2, −2) + (2, −2) threshold. As it approaches
threshold, the bound state acquires a large fraction of
threshold character. The amplitude of its wavefunction

at short range decreases in both the closed channel and
the threshold channel. This reduces its width Γ and in-
creases its lifetime τ = ¯h/Γ close to threshold.

We use the interaction potential of Strauss et al. [19],
without retardation corrections. We perform coupled-
channel calculations using the molscat [11, 13] and
bound [10, 11] packages. The methods used are as de-
scribed in Ref. [20]. The Hamiltonian includes atomic
hyperﬁne coupling, electron and nuclear Zeeman terms,
and coupling due to the singlet and triplet interaction
potentials. The state decays through a combination of
dipolar spin-spin and second-order spin-orbit interactions
[21]. The wave function is expanded in a fully uncoupled
basis set that contains all allowed spin functions for each
value of the end-over-end angular momentum L of the
colliding pair.

We ﬁrst perform calculations using a restricted basis
set that includes only functions with L = 0. This re-
moves channels with MF = mf ,a + mf ,b > −4, including
the open channels, so that the quasibound states of in-
terest become truly bound. We locate these bound states
using the bound package, and use the results as initial
estimates of the resonance positions. We then switch to
a full basis set, including functions with L = 0 and 2,
and carry out scattering calculations using the molscat
package.

Table II shows the convergence on the bound state be-
low the (2, −2) + (2, −2) threshold at a magnetic ﬁeld of
B = 155 G, where it is bound by only 140 × h Hz and
is less than 1 × h Hz wide. Under these conditions, the
initial estimate of the binding energy from bound-state
calculations is inaccurate by over 1900 times the width,
which is about 13.5 times the binding energy. Nonethe-
less, our method converges with calculations at only 9
energies. Remarkably, even the estimate of the width
from the ﬁrst 3 points is within 20% of the converged
value.

We repeat this convergence procedure for a range of
magnetic ﬁelds and obtain the lifetimes shown in Fig.

5

C. Energy dependence of background scattering

At each step, the procedure described here obtains es-
timates of the resonance position and width.
In their
simplest form, these estimates neglect the energy depen-
dence of the background phase shift or eigenphase sum
δbg(E). They are in error if δbg(E) varies signiﬁcantly
across the current range of points. A background energy
dependence may prevent identiﬁcation of the resonance
from far away and, in drastic cases, may prevent con-
vergence on the resonance even from points near to it.
However, in many cases it is possible to obtain an es-
timate of δbg(E). It is then straightforward to redeﬁne
(cid:101)a(E) = tan(δ(E) − δbg(E)) and use the rest of the pro-
cedure exactly as before.

The estimate of δbg(E) may come from a variety of
sources.
It may be as simple as estimating the back-
ground gradient from a plot of δ(E), or it might include
the eﬀects of other resonances whose properties are al-
ready known. More sophisticated estimates may also be
envisaged, based for example on semiclassical phase inte-
grals for non-resonant open channels. In any case it is not
necessary for the estimate to include the constant part of
δbg(E), which is accounted for by the 3-point approach,
but only its energy dependence.

In the presence of uncorrected background variation
in δbg(E), the resonance parameters obtained depend on
the positions of the outer two points within the range
permitted by the tolerance ξ. Diﬀerent convergence se-
quences may result in diﬀerently positioned points and
produce small apparently random variations in the pa-
rameters. Such variations may be unacceptable in some
applications, such as calculating numerical derivatives of
resonance parameters when performing least-squares ﬁts
of potential parameters to experimental data. They may
be reduced or eliminated by choosing a small value of the
tolerance ξ.

IV. PARTIAL WIDTHS

The product state distribution from decay of a quasi-
bound state is characterized by a set of partial widths
Γi for each open channel i. For an isolated narrow res-
onance, the partial widths sum to the total width Γ.
Across a resonance, each S-matrix element describes a
circle in the complex plane [23, 24]

Sii(cid:48)(E) = Sbg,ii(cid:48) −

igigi(cid:48)
E − Eres + iΓ/2

.

(8)

The partial widths are deﬁned as real quantities, Γi =
|gi|2, and the circles in the complex plane have radii
√
ΓiΓi(cid:48)/Γ; the complex coeﬃcients gi also have phases
φi, which determine the orientations of the circles in the
complex plane.

For each S-matrix element, Eq. (8) contains 6 indepen-
dent parameters. We can determine the magnitude and

using the present method and the red dashed line shows the
result of Eq. (9) of K¨ohler et al. [22].

2. At ﬁelds below 155 G, where the quasibound state is
extremely narrow, the initial estimate of the energy from
bound-state calculations is inadequate.
In this region
we obtain the initial estimate from linear extrapolation
based on previous energies.

K¨ohler et al. [22] developed a model for the decay of
this bound state. They obtained an analytic expression
for the lifetime at magnetic ﬁelds just above the reso-
nance, where the bound state is dominated by the open-
channel component. Figure 2 includes the result of Eq.
(9) of Ref. [22]; we use values for the real and imaginary
parts of the scattering length from our coupled-channel
calculations. The analytic expression of Ref. [22] is accu-
rate close to the resonance, but breaks down far from it.
The coupled-channel results correctly approach the life-
time of the underlying quasibound state, but the analytic
expression for the lifetime drops unphysically to zero, be-
cause it is based on an expression for the closed-channel
amplitude that is valid only close to resonance.

K¨ohler et al. performed coupled-channel scattering cal-
culations at 9 speciﬁc values of the magnetic ﬁeld. The
calculations were too laborious for them to show the re-
sults as a curve rather than isolated points. It should be
noted that they used an earlier interaction potential than
the present work, which produced a signiﬁcantly shorter
lifetime (32 µs) for the underlying state. We have in-
vestigated the dependence of this lifetime on the dipolar
spin-spin and second-order spin-orbit interactions, which
have opposite sign for the interaction potential of Ref.
[19]. We ﬁnd that the lifetime is strongly dependent on
the degree of cancelation between the two.

phase of the product gigi(cid:48), but not gi and gi(cid:48) individually.
As each element has real and imaginary parts, we need
calculations at 3 points to determine these 6 parameters.
However, the position Eres and total width Γ are common
to the behavior of all S-matrix elements. Our usual pro-
cedure is therefore to keep these two parameters ﬁxed at
the values determined from ﬁtting to the eigenphase sum,
as described in Section II, and use calculations at only
2 points in order to characterize the real and imaginary
parts of Sbg,ii(cid:48) and gigi(cid:48).

Equation (8) may be written

S(E) = Sbg +

iD
x + i

,

(9)

where x = 2(E −Eres)/Γ and D is a matrix with elements
Dii(cid:48) = −2gigi(cid:48)/Γ. We insert calculated S matrices S1 and
S2 at two energies E1 and E2, and solve the resulting
simultaneous equations to give

Sbg =

(x1 + i)S1 − (x2 + i)S2
x1 − x2

;

D = (1 − ix1)(S1 − Sbg).

(10)

(11)

The partial widths are obtained from the diagonal ele-
ments, Γi = |Dii|Γ/2.

We evaluate the partial widths after convergence on
Eres and Γ as described in Section II. We use S matrices
at two of the three energies used in the ﬁnal iteration
of the convergence procedure; these S matrices have al-
ready been calculated during the convergence, so we need
no additional coupled-channel calculations. For narrow
resonances (including the examples covered in this pa-
per), where convergence is limited by numerical noise, it
is best to use the points closest to and furthest from the
resonance position. For wide resonances, where conver-
gence is limited by a non-constant background, it is best
to use the two points closest to the resonance position.

We have applied this procedure to the Ar–H2 example
described above, and the results are shown in Table III.
It may be seen that they are in excellent agreement with
those of ref. [8], which were obtained by a much more
laborious ﬁtting procedure.

It is also possible to use a 3-point approach based on
the resonant circle in a single S-matrix element. This is

analogous to the “fully complex” procedure of Ref. [9]
and allows convergence on Eres and Γ as well as Sbg,ii(cid:48)
and Dii(cid:48). In multichannel scattering, we have sometimes
found that this procedure converges successfully, even
for resonances where uncorrected energy dependence in
the background prevents convergence based on the eigen-
phase sum. This occurs because the eigenphase sum con-
tains background contributions from all open channels,
whereas a diagonal S-matrix element contains a back-
ground contribution from only a single open channel.
Nevertheless, it is usually more convenient to locate reso-
nances initially in the eigenphase sum, using an estimated
background energy dependence if necessary.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed an automated procedure to con-
verge on a scattering resonance and characterize it in
terms of the resonance energy and width and the phase
shift (or S-matrix eigenphase sum) of the background
scattering. The procedure may be used for both single-
channel and multichannel scattering.
It eliminates the
extensive manual iteration and ﬁtting inherent in previ-
ous approaches.

The procedure requires an initial set of three energies
in the vicinity of the resonance, one of which must be
close enough to the resonance that its phase shift is af-
fected by the resonance by more than the variation of the
background phase across the range of the points. The
strategy employed aims to generate a set of three points,
one very close to the center of the resonance and two oth-
ers at varying distances on either side. The three points
allow characterization of the resonance position, width
and background phase. Subsequent processing of the S-
matrix elements allows extraction of partial widths for
decay to individual open channels.

We have demonstrated the method on two very diﬀer-
ent test cases. One is a very narrow state in the Van der
Waals complex Ar–H2, which lies far from any thresh-
old and decays only by vibrational predissociation. The
other is a near-threshold state of 85Rb2, whose lifetime
varies from ∼80 µs to over 1 s as a function of magnetic
ﬁeld.

An important use of the procedure will be in least-
squares ﬁtting to determine interaction potentials from
experimental results [25–29]. Such ﬁts require numerical
derivatives of calculated properties with respect to poten-
tial parameters, and the calculation of these derivatives
is not feasible if manual intervention is required.

We have implemented the procedure in version 2020.0
the general-purpose quantum scattering package

of
molscat [11].
