ABSTRACT 
Wave theories of heating the chromosphere, corona, and solar wind due to photospheric fluctuations are 
strengthened  by  the  existence  of  observed  wave  coherency  up  to  the  transition  region  (TR).  The 
coherency of solar spicules' intensity oscillations was explored using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) 
on the Hinode spacecraft with a height increase above the solar limb in active region (AR). We used 
time sequences near the southeast region from the Hinode/SOT in Ca II H line obtained on April 3, 2015 
and  applied  the  de-convolution  procedure  to  the  spicule  in  order  to  illustrate  how  effectively  our 
restoration method  works  on  fine  structures  such  as  spicules.  Moreover,  the  intensity  oscillations  at 
different heights above the solar limb were analysed through wavelet transforms. Afterwards, the phase 
difference was measured among oscillations at two certain heights  in search of evidence for coherent 
oscillations. The results of wavelet transformations revealed dominant period peaks in 2, 4, 5.5, and 6.5 
min at four separate heights. The dominant frequencies for coherency level higher than 75 percent was 
found to be around 5.5 and 8.5 mHz. Mean phase speeds of 155-360 km s-1 were measured. We found 
that the mean phase speeds increased with height.  The results suggest that the energy flux carried by 
coherent waves into the corona and heliosphere may be several times larger than previous estimates that 
were  based  solely  on  constant  velocities.  We  provide  compelling  evidence  for  the  existence  of 
upwardly propagating coherent waves.

1 INTRODUCTION 

The  interface  between  the  lower  solar  atmosphere,  where 
energy  is  generated  by  subsurface  convection  and  the  corona, 
comprises  the  chromosphere  which  is  dominated  by  jet-like, 
dynamic structures. These are called mottles when found in quiet 
regions, ﬁbrils when initiated in active regions, and spicules when 
observed  at  a  solar  limb.  Space  observations  with  Hinode  have 
two  different  types  of  spicules,  namely  type-I  and  type-II,  each 
having different properties (De Pontieu et al. 2007; Tsiropoula et 
al. 2012).  

Pereira, De Pontieu, and Carlsson (2012) found clear evidence 
for  the  existence  of  two  types  of  spicules.  Type-I  spicules 
revealed a rise and fall and had typical lifetimes of 150-400 s and 
maximum  ascending  velocities  of  15-40  km  s-1,  while  type-II 
spicules  enjoyed  shorter  lifetimes  of  50-150  s,  much  faster 
velocities of 30-110 km s-1, and were not seen to fall down in the 
Ca II H ﬁlter. Rather, they tend to fade at around their maximum 
length.  Type-II  spicules  are  found  to  be  the  most  common  and 
were  seen  in  quiet  sun  and  coronal  holes.  Type-I  spicules  have 
been  mostly  spotted  in  active  regions.  The  fading  of  type-II 
spicules had reinforced the idea that they were rapidly heated to 
higher temperatures, not  visible in the  Ca  II H  ﬁlter, and  might 
deposit  mass  and  energy  at  coronal  heights  (De  Pontieu  et  al. 
2007, 2009). 

Madjarska, Vanninathan, and Doyle (2011) analysed three large 
spicules  and  found  that  they  comprised  numerous  thin  spicules 
which  rose,  rotated,  and  descended  simultaneously  forming  a 
bush-like  feature.  Their  rotation  resembled  the  untwisting  of  a 
large ﬂux rope. They showed velocities ranging from 50-250 km 
s-1.

(2012) used a time dependent magneto-hydrodynamic model. He

Lorentz  force  under  chromospheric  conditions,  and  maximum 
vertical flow could reach a speed of 150-460 km s-1. 

Gupta et al. (2013) detected period bands of 2-4 min, 4-6 min, 
6-15  min,  and  long–period  oscillations  with  periods  between  15 
and  30  min in bright  magnetic  points  from  the  chromosphere to 
the transition region. He et al. (2009) reported that spicules were 
modulated  by  relatively  high  frequency  (>0.02  Hz)  transverse 
fluctuations  that propagated upward along with the spicules  with 
phase speed ranges from 50-150 km s-1. Some of these modulated 
spicules  displayed  clear  wave-like  shapes  with  wavelengths 
shorter than 8 Mm.  

Using  images  with  high  temporal  and  spatial  resolutions 
obtained  from  Hinode/SOT,  De  Pontieu  et al.  (2007)  discovered 
that  the  chromosphere (i.e., the region  between the  solar  surface 
and the corona) are permeated by Alfvén waves with amplitudes 
on the order of 10 to 25  km s-1 and periods of 100 to 500 s. The 
energy fluxes carried by these waves are estimated to be energetic 
enough to accelerate the solar wind and possibly to heat the quiet 
corona. 

Tavabi  (2014)  investigated  off-limb  and  on-disk  spicules  to 
detect  a  counterpart  of  the  limb  spicule  on the  disk  and  found a 
deﬁnite  signature  with  strong  power  in  3  min  (5.5  mHz)  and  5 
min (3.5 mHz), a full range of oscillations, and a high frequency 
of  intensity  ﬂuctuation (greater than 10  mHz  or  less than 100  s) 
corresponding to the occurrence of type-II spicules. 

Using spectral imaging data in the Ca  II 854.2 nm and Hα lines 
with Crisp Imaging Spectro Polarimeter (CRISP) at the Swedish 
Solar Telescope (SST) in La Palma,  Rouppe van der Voort et al. 
(2009)  reported  the  discovery  of  disk  counterparts  for  type-II 
spicule.  They  showed  that  the  attributes  of  these  rapid  blue 
excursions on the disk are very similar to those of type-II spicules 
at the limb. A detailed study of the spectral line profiles in these 
events suggests that plasma is accelerated along  with the jet and 
is heated throughout the short lifetime of the event.

Tian  et  al.  (2014)  reported  that  high-speed-up  flows  appear  at 
speeds of 80-250 km s-1. 

De Pontieu et al. (2009, 2011) came to this finding that type-II 
spicules  represented  an  impulsively  accelerated  chromospheric 
material  that  is  continuously  heated  while  rising.  The  causes  of 
the  heating  and acceleration  are  unknown.  However,  a  magnetic 
process such as reconnection is likely to be important.  

De  Pontieu  et  al.  (2012)  used  high-quality  observations  with 
SST  to  establish  that  type-II  spicules  are  characterized  by  three 
different types of motion, namely field-aligned flows of order 50-
100 km s-1, swaying motions of order 15-20 km s-1, and torsional 
motions  of  order  25-30  km  s-1.  Their  analysis  yielded  strong 
evidence  that  most,  if  not  all,  type-II  spicules  undergo  large 
torsional  modulations.  In  addition,  these  motions,  like  spicule 
swaying,  represent  Alfvenic  waves  propagating  outward  at 
several hundred km s-1. Moreover, they found that large torsional 
motion was an ingredient in the production of type-II spicules and 
spicules  played  an  important  role  in  the  transfer  of  helicity 
through the solar atmosphere. 

Through  making  coordinated  observations  with  IRIS  and  SST, 
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2015) found spectral signatures for 
rapid blue- and red-shifted excursions in C II 1335 Å and 1336 Å 
and Si IV 1394 Å and 1403 Å spectral lines. They interpreted this 
as  a  clue  that  type-II  spicules  are  heated  to  at  least  TR 
temperatures. 

Tavabi  et  al.  (2015b)  found  that  surge-like  behavior  of  solar

supported

region 
interpretation  of  spicules  exhibiting  helical 
componential 
dynamics. They analysed the proper transverse motions of mature 
and  tall  polar  region  spicules  at  different  heights  in  detail. 
Assuming that there might  exist Helical-Kink waves or Alfvenic 
waves  propagating  inside  their  multi-componential  substructure, 
they  interpreted  the  quasi-coherent  behavior  of  all  visible 
components  presumably  conﬁned  by  a  surrounding  magnetic 
envelope.  In  addition,  they  concentrated  their  analysis  on  the 
taller Ca II spicules which is more pertinent to coronal heights and 
easy to measure. 

The  observed  contrast  of  small  scale  features  like  spicules  is 
influenced  by  the  point  spread  function  (PSF).  In  particular,  the 
scattered  light  strongly  reduces  the  contrast.  Spicules,  which  are 
small  structures,  are  strongly  affected  (Mathew,  Zakharov,  & 
Solanki, 2009). Optical devices such as telescopes could not work 
as  effectively  as  their  diffraction  limited  quality  due  to  optical 
aberration  arising  from  imperfections,  thermal  changes  and 
impurities.  They  diverge  from  optimum  adjustment  owing  to  the 
passage  of  time.  Even a  small  dust  or  scratch  may  produce  a 
significantly  scattered  light.  Scattered  light  is  mathematically 
described by  using  the  extended  wings  of  the  PSF,  which  causes 
an  image  of  the  point  source  of  light  to  be  largely  spread 
(Richardson, 1972; Lucy, 1974).  

In  the  present  study,  we  used  time  sequences  taken  by  the 
Hinode/SOT in Ca II H (396.8 nm) line. We studied the frequency 
of spicules’ oscillations and their coherency at different heights. 

2 OBSERVATIONS 

We  used  time  sequences  of  AR  data  taken  near  the  southeast 
region  of  solar  limb  observed  in  the  Ca  II  H  line  with  the 
Hinode/SOT (the wavelength pass-band was centred at 396.8 nm 
with a  FWHM  of 0.3 nm).  The  characteristics  of the  observation 
series are summarized in Table 1.

The  standard  SOT  subroutines  (WV_DENOISE,  FG_SHIFT_PIX,

data,  correct  the  CCD  readout  anomalies,  bad  pixels,  and  ﬂat-
ﬁelds, and subtract the dark pedestal.  

3 DATA ANALYSIS 

In  order  to  reduce  scattered  and/or  stray  light  in  the  extended 
wings of the PSF (Mathew, Zakarov, & Solanki 2009), the Max-
likelihood  routine  was  applied  to  all  images.  Due  to  the  use  of 
IDL Max-likelihood program, Root Mean Square (RMS) contrast 
of the images went up. The normalized RMS contrasts are factors 
of 1.61 higher than those obtained before PSF de-convolution. 

Then,  Mad-max  operator  was  applied  to  improve  the  visibility 
of  fine  features  and  to  clarify  the  images  (see  Fig.  1d).  The 
operator  considerably  reduced  background  noise  (Koutchmy  & 
Koutchmy,  1989;  November  &  Koutchmy,  1996;  Tavabi, 
Koutchmy, & Ajabshirizadeh, 2013; Tavabi 2014).  

Spicules  displayed  radial  outflow,  suggesting  Alfvenic  wave 
propagation at about 300 km s−1 outward along with the spicules 
(De Pontieu et al. 2007b, 2012). The continuation of  these waves 
into the transition region and corona indicates that they can help to 
drive away the solar wind (McIntosh et al. 2011). 

Most  spicules  oriented  approximately  perpendicular  to  the 
surface of the Sun in the radial direction (see Fig. 1d). Therefore, 
the fluctuations were analysed at different heights above the solar 
limb in X and Y axes, simultaneously. We measured phase speeds 
in radial direction. The sum of  the two phase speeds along the X 
and Y axes was approximately equal to the phase speed along the 
spicules. To this end, diagrams of time-slices were prepared using 
the  highly  processed  images  to  look  for  spatial  variations  of  the 
spicules with temporal changes. 

An  algorithm  for  the  time-X/Y  cut  diagram  puts  together  a 
specific  row/column  of  all  processed images  from  top to  bottom 
and  from  left  to  right.  We  analysed  all  pixels  in  the  X  and  Y 
directions. Fig. 2 depicts only one example for Y =  −517 arcsec, 
and Fig. 3 shows for X= -854 arcsec (Tavabi 2014). 

The wavelet results obtained in four separate heights are marked 
by 1, 2, 3, and 4 red color lines in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The heights 
start from clinging to the solar limb to out of  the limb equivalent 
to  4200  km  (at  a  distance  of  1400  km  from  each  other, 
respectively). The wavelet results showed dominant periods about 
2, 4, 5.5, and 6.5 min (see Fig. 4 for time-X cut series and Fig. 5 
for time-Y cut series).  

Detailed  wavelet  analysis  which  supply  information  on  the 
temporal  variation  of  a  signal  are  described  in  Torrence  and 
Compo  (1998).  The  Morlet  function  was  used  in  line  with  the 
definition  given 
(1998)  and 
Ajabshirizadeh,  Tavabi  and  Koutchmy  (2008)  for  convolution 
with time series in wavelet transformation. 

in  Torrence  and  Compo 

Similar oscillations in all time sequences at four separate heights 
were identified  by  comparing the  results  of wavelet  analysis  for 
time-X cut, and time-Y cut series. 

We  used  cross-spectrum  phase,  coherence  estimates, and  the 
cross-wavelet  transform  software  package  (Torrence  &  Compo, 
1998)  between  two  heights  and  calculated  the  coherency,  phase 
differences, and cross-wavelet oscillations (Fig. 6, and Fig. 7, for 
time-X  cut  and 
time-Y  cut  series,  respectively;  see  2D 
representation in Tavabi et al. 2015a; 2D and 3D representation in 
Zeighami  et  al.  2016). The  findings  of  the  coherent  oscillations 
between  two  different  heights  showed  coherency  in  periods  of 
about 2 and 3 min. 

Measurements  of  the  phase  difference  between  two  intensity 
profiles obtained at the two heights yielded information about the 
phase  delay  between  oscillations  as  a  function  of  frequency 
(Trauth, 2007; Oppenheim & Verghese, 2010). These calculations 
were made for maximum coherency higher than 75 %. The results 
of the phase difference analysis revealed coherency at frequencies 
similar to those of the cross-wavelet results (Fig. 8 panels a, and b, 
for time-X cut and time-Y cut series, respectively). 
Using  the  equation  for  phase  difference  as  a  function  of 
frequency, 
where f is the frequency (in Hz) and T is 
the  time  difference  (in  seconds),  we  obtained  the  time  delay 
between two adjacent layers. Afterwards, we calculated the phase 
, where 
speed between these heights using the equation

Coherent Spicule Oscillations

H is the distance between the two heights. We computed the phase 
difference and phase speed for maximum coherency from all the 
coherency  plots.  Through  this  procedure,  we  took  all  the  time-
slice results into consideration. The mean phase speeds between 

two heights were 85, 140, and 195 km s-1 for time-X cut series and 
130, 220, and 305 km s-1  correspondingly for time-Y cut  series, 
respectively. We found that the mean phase speed increased with 
height.

drift had an average speed of lower than 0.064''/min.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  

The  findings  revealed  that  the  use  of  the  IDL  Max-likelihood 
program  led  to  an  increase  in  the  RMS  contrast  of  the  images. 
The  normalized  RMS  contrasts  are  factors  of  1.61  higher  than 
those obtained before PSF de-convolution.  

Figure 4. (a)-(d) represent the 3-D wavelet results obtained from intensity 
profiles for time-X cut series corresponding to the four heights  which are 
displayed by four red color lines in Fig. 2 (for Y= - 517 arcsec). The solid 
white curve in the plot at each panel indicates the cone of influence region 
(COI)  where  the  wavelet  power  spectra  are  distorted  because  of  the 
influence of the end points of finite length signals. 

Figure 5. (a)-(d) represent an example of the 3-D wavelet results obtained 
from  intensity  profiles  for  time-Y  cut  series  corresponding  to  the  four 
heights that are marked by four red color lines in Fig. 3 (corresponding to 
X=  - 854 arcsec). The  white  curve in the  plot  at each  panel  has a  similar 
meaning as in Fig. 4.

coherency  between  two  heights  for  time-X  cut  series.  (a)-(c)  show  the 
wavelet  coherency  spectrum  between  two  heights,  i.e.,  1st  and  2nd,  2nd  and 
3rd, 3rd and 4th heights,  respectively (for Y= -  517 arcsec). The white  curve 
in the plot at each panel has a similar meaning  as in Figs. 4 and 5.

and  3rd,  3rd  and  4th  heights,  respectively  (for  X=  -  854  arcsec).  The  white 
curve in the plot at each panel has a similar meaning  as in Figs. 4, 5, and 6.

waves  propagated  between  different  heights.  Panel's  a  plot  for  time-X  cut 
series,  and  panel's  b  plot  for  time-Y  cut  series.  Dashed  lines  are  for 
coherency  between  1st  and  2nd  heights,  dotted  dash  lines  for  coherency 
between 2nd and 3rd  heights, and dotted lines  for coherency between 3rd  and 
4th heights.   

  The wavelet results indicated dominant periods of about 2 min, 
4  min,  5.5  min,  and  6.5  min,  corresponding  to  the  findings  of 
Zaqarashvili and  Erdélyi  (2009),  Gupta  et al.  (2013),  Hansteen, 
Betta and Carlsson, (2000), and Tavabi (2014). As expected, the 
results of coherency at two certain heights represented periods at 
about  2,  and  3  min  oscillations.  The  dominant  frequency  for 
coherency  level  exceeding  75  percent  showed  frequencies  of 
about 5.5, and 8.5 mHz. The mean phase speeds between the two 
heights were 85, 140, and 195  km s-1, for time-X cut series  and 
130, 220, and 305 km s-1 for time-Y cut series, respectively. The 
findings  emanating  from  these  two-speed  components  provided 
mean  phase  speeds  of  155-360 km  s-1  for AR  (McIntosh  et  al. 
2011; Okamoto & De Pontieu 2011).  

Tavabi  et  al.  (2015a)  used  three-time  sequences  for  the  quiet 
Sun (22,  November,  2006), active  Sun  (15, January,  2014),  and 
active  region  (26,  January,  2007)  from  the  equator  of  the  solar 
limb  observed  in  Ca  II H  line  by  Hinode/SOT.  The  mean  phase 
speeds measured by Tavabi et al. (2015a) for the quiet Sun were 
found to be 50-450 km s-1, 50-650 km s-1 for the active region, and 
50-550 km s-1 for the active Sun. Zeighami et al. (2016) used time 
sequences  of  AR  data  (26,  January,  2007)  taken  at  the  solar 
equatorial limb observed in the Ca II H line with the Hinode/SOT. 
They reported mean phase speeds within the range of 250-425 km 
s-1 for AR data. 

Furthermore, we clearly observe that the phase speed increases 
with  height.  This  could  be  caused  by  two  parameters.  For  one 
thing,  for  greater  heights,  the  Alfven  speed  is  higher  since  the 
plasma density is low. Considering that the magnetic ﬁeld strength 
is expected to decrease with height, the range of phase speeds at 
heights below 4200 km seems reasonable. 

Similar  results  were  obtained  by  Okamoto  and  De  Pontieu 
(2011) for individual packets of transverse waves by analysing the 
horizontal  displacement  of  the  medial  axes  of  the  spicules  as  a 
function of  time  and  height.  However,  as  described  in  Okamoto 
and  De  Pontieu  (2011),  the  phase  speeds  at  heights  above  15 
arcsec (6000 km) appear to be too high to be explained in terms of 
the change in Alfven speed. Another reason is that the upward and 
downward  propagating  waves  are  more  often  superposed  at 
greater heights. This would arise naturally in a scenario in which 
numerous waves are excited at lower heights, reﬂected at the TR 
at the top of spicules, thereby resulting in downward propagating 
waves  at  greater  heights  (just  below  the  top).  Okamoto  and  De 
Pontieu (2011) observed a combination of upward and downward 
propagating  waves  near  the  top  of  spicules.  Regarding  the  high 
reflection coefficient of the  TR (Hollweg, Jackson, &  Galloway; 
1982), it is expected that the downward and upward propagating 
waves have roughly equal amplitudes. However, since some of the 
wave energy leaks into the corona, the amplitudes are not  equal.

Coherent Spicule Oscillations

Superposition  of  the  counter  propagating  waves  could  lead  to 
partially standing waves with very high phase speeds. To our best 
knowledge, the reﬂected waves have not been found to reach back 
down to the bottom of the spicules.  The increase in Alfven speed 
and  the  reﬂection  of  the  top  of  the  spicule  provide  a  good 
justification for the upsurge in phase speed in parallel with height. 
A  comparison  of  the  findings  obtained  from  this  study  with 
those of Tavabi et al. 2015a, Zeighami et al. 2016  indicated that 
dominant frequencies and mean phase speeds might be dependent 
on the location of spicules in the limb of the sun, solar cycle, and 
active region.
