Abstract 

The weak infrared spectrum of CO2-Ar corresponding to the (0111)  (0110) hot band of 

CO2 is detected in the region of the carbon dioxide 3 fundamental vibration (2340 cm-1), using 

a tunable OPO laser source to probe a pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion. While this method 

was previously thought to cool clusters to the lowest rotational states of the ground vibrational 

state, here we show that under suitable jet expansion conditions, sufficient population remains in 

the first excited bending mode of CO2 (1-2%) to enable observation of vibrationally hot CO2-Ar, 

and thus to investigate the symmetry breaking of the intramolecular bending mode of CO2 in the 

presence of Ar. The bending mode of CO2 monomer splits into an in-plane and an out-of-plane 

mode, strongly linked by a Coriolis interaction.  Analysis of the spectrum yields a direct 

measurement of the in-plane / out-of-plane splitting measured to be 0.8770 cm-1. Calculations 

were carried to determine if key features of our results, i.e., the sign and magnitude of the shift in 

the energy for the two intramolecular bending modes, are consistent with a quantum chemical 

potential energy surface. This aspect of intramolecular interactions has received little previous 

experimental and theoretical consideration. Therefore, we provide an additional avenue by which 

 
 
 
 
to study the intramolecular dynamics of this simplest dimer in its bending modes. Similar results 

should be possible for other weakly-bound complexes.

1.  Introduction 

High resolution spectroscopy of weakly-bound van der Waals complexes gives direct 

information on intermolecular forces and dynamics. Resolved rotational transitions give 

structural information which helps to determine minima in the intermolecular potentials. 

Intermolecular vibrational intervals give complementary information on the potential energy 

surface. Intramolecular vibrations exhibit shifts (usually relatively small) which show how the 

monomer dynamics are affected by the presence of a weakly-bound partner. Most current 

information on such vibrational shifts relates to stretching vibrations; there is very little data for 

monomer bends, in particular for the bending modes of simple linear molecules like CO2, N2O, 

C2H2, HCN, etc. This shortage of data is probably due in part to a lack of good tunable laser 

sources in the far-infrared region (say below 1000 cm-1) where these bending fundamentals 

usually lie. One notable exception to this data shortage is a 1993 study of the C2H2-Ar dimer by 

Ohshima et al.1 They studied the spectrum in the region of the C2H2 5 bending vibration (730 

cm-1), and found that the presence of the nearby argon atom induces an overall blue shift of 

+0.393 cm-1 and a modest splitting of 0.138 cm-1.  

In the present paper, we study the 2 bending mode of CO2, (v1, v2

l2, v3) = (0110), in the 

CO2-Ar dimer. Rather than directly observing the CO2 2 fundamental in the 667 cm-1 region, we 

detect the (0111)  (0110) hot band in the 3 fundamental region near 2337 cm-1. This 

serendipitous observation is due to the inefficiency in vibrational cooling in the supersonic jet 

which leaves 1-2% of the vibrationally hot CO2-Ar in the first excited bending mode of CO2. We 

therefore face the difficulty of a small population in our (0110) initial state. But this is 

compensated by the advantages of an excellent tunable mid-infrared source, the use of quantum-

correlated twin beams for detection2 and a large transition strength for the 3 mode.  

 
  4 

Spectra of CO2-Ar were first studied in the microwave region by Steed et al.,3 who 

established a T-shaped structure with an intermolecular separation of about 3.5 Å. Since then, 

there has been further microwave work,4,5 as well as infrared studies in the CO2 3 

6-10 and 3 + 

1/22 4,11 regions. The CO2-Ar2 trimer has also been detected.12,13 There have been many 

theoretical investigations of CO2-Ar interactions,11-19 including two relatively recent ab initio 

studies of the complete potential surface which explicitly include its dependence on the CO2 3 

mode.20,21 But as far as we know, there are no theoretical predictions of the shift or splitting of 

the CO2 2 mode in CO2-Ar.   

2.  Background theory 

The CO2-Ar structure is T-shaped, with the a-inertial axis connecting Ar and C, the b-axis 

parallel to the O-C-O axis, and the c-axis perpendicular to the CO2-Ar plane. This corresponds to 

a C2v point group, whose fundamental vibrational modes can have A1 symmetry (intramolecular 

1 symmetric stretch, in-plane component of the intramolecular 2 bend, intermolecular van der 

Waals stretch), B2 symmetry (intramolecular 3 stretch, intermolecular bend), or B1 symmetry 

(out-of-plane component of the intramolecular 2 bend). In addition, A2 symmetry can occur for 

combination modes involving B1  B2. Nuclear spin statistics for 16O mean that only even-Ka 

levels are possible for A1 and A2 modes (including the ground state), and only odd-Ka for B1 and 

B2 modes. In this paper, K stands for Ka unless otherwise indicated. 

In the present case, we are interested in the in-plane (i-p) and out-of-plane (o-p) CO2-Ar 

vibrations corresponding to the CO2 (0110) and (0111) modes. As already mentioned, the lower 

states, the (0110) i-p and o-p modes, have A1 and B1 symmetry, respectively. For the upper states, 

the (0111) i-p and o-p modes, we multiply by B2 and obtain B2 and A2 symmetry, respectively. 

  5 

The CO2 3 stretch generates a transition moment parallel to the CO2-Ar b-axis, so we expect 

spectra with b-type selection rules (Ka = 1, Kc = 1, 3). The i-p component will be B2  A1 

with only Ka = odd  even subbands, and the o-p component will be A2  B1 with only Ka = 

even  odd subbands. We also expect strong Coriolis mixing between the i-p and o-p modes 

within the lower and upper states, just as observed by Ohshima et al.1 for C2H2-Ar. In our case 

this is a b-type interaction, characterized by a matrix element 

i-p, J, k  H o-p, J, k  1 = ½ b  [J(J + 1) – k(k  1)]½, 

where k is signed Ka, and b is the Coriolis interaction parameter (notation used for consistency 

with Ref. 1). The parameterb is connected to the usual dimensionless Coriolis zeta parameter by 

the relation b = 2B, where B is the B rotational constant and  can take values between zero (no 

coupling) and unity (complete Coriolis coupling). 

3.  Results 

3.1. Experimental spectrum analysis 

Spectra were recorded at the University of Calgary as described previously,22-24 using a 

pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion probed by a rapid-scan optical parametric oscillator source 

and the use of quantum-correlated twin beams (idler and signal) for cancellation of the power 

fluctuations.2 The gas expansion mixture contained about 0.04% carbon dioxide plus 0.8% argon 

in helium carrier gas with a backing pressure of about 13 atmospheres. Spectra were also 

recorded with a mixture containing only CO2 and He to help verify which spectral features 

required Ar. Wavenumber calibration was carried out by simultaneously recording signals from a 

fixed etalon and a reference gas cell containing room temperature CO2. Spectral simulation and 

fitting were made using the PGOPHER software.25 

 
  6 

The observed spectrum is shown in the top trace of Fig. 1, where known transitions of 

CO2 monomer have been ‘clipped out’ in order to show only features requiring the presence of 

Ar. The central K = 1  0 subband of the i-p component is quite prominent in Fig. 1, with its 

strong Q-branch (2336.35 - 2336.50 cm-1) and R-branch (2336.6 - 2337.3 cm-1). But the correct 

assignment of this subband (and the rest of the spectrum) was not immediately evident. Our 

assignment strategy was to fix all rotational constants at their known ground state values,3,6 and 

to assume complete Coriolis mixing in both the lower and upper states (that is, assume  = 1, 

meaning that b = 2B = 0.132 cm-1). This reduced the search for a good PGOPHER simulation to 

one unknown parameter, namely the separation of the i-p and o-p modes, assumed to be equal in 

the lower and upper states. When the correct solution was found, it turned out that the K = 1  0 

Q-branch is shaded such that higher J-values go to lower wavenumbers, opposite to the normal 

expectation for a b-type band. This effect of the Coriolis interaction helps to explain why the 

correct assignment was not obvious at first. 

Ultimately, we fitted 178 transitions with values of J ranging up to 11, and values of K 

from 0 to 3 in both the upper and lower states. The resulting parameters are shown in Table 1. 

This Table includes known6 ground state CO2-Ar parameters for comparison. The quality of the 

fit is very good, with an average rms deviation (obs – calc) of about 0.0002 cm-1, similar to the 

experimental uncertainty. In addition to the normally expected transitions within the i-p or o-p 

stacks of rotational levels, we also observed many transitions between the stacks. Such 

transitions are made possible by the Coriolis mixing, and follow selection rules Ka = 0, 2, Kc 

= 0, 2. They of course ensure that the splittings between i-p and o-p level stacks are very 

accurately determined. The division of our simulated spectra (Fig. 1) into in-plane and out-of-

plane components, as given by the PGOPHER fit, is somewhat arbitrary because the Coriolis 

  7 

mixing is so strong.  

3.2. Discussion 

In order to illustrate the Coriolis interaction in CO2-Ar, Fig. 2 shows lower and upper 

state calculated energy levels with and without the interaction. These are “reduced” energy levels 

from which the basic rotational dependence, ½(B + C)  J(J + 1), has been subtracted for clearer 

presentation. An important point is that, because the o-p mode is shifted up relative to the i-p 

mode, the o-p K = 1 levels in the lower state lie very close to the i-p K = 2 levels. This greatly 

enhances the effect of the Coriolis interaction, leading to almost complete mixing of K = 1 and 2 

as J increases. Levels with K = 0 encounter smaller, but still significant shifts, while K = 3 levels 

are only slightly perturbed. The level pattern is quite different in the CO2 (0111) upper 

vibrational state, even though its parameters such as splitting are very similar, since now the i-p 

mode has odd K-values and the o-p mode has even K. 

For the bending mode of an isolated linear molecule such as CO2, it is most useful to 

characterize vibrational dynamics in terms of vibrational angular momentum, equivalent to a 

Coriolis interaction with an implicit -value of exactly unity. Since the differential perturbation 

introduced by Ar in the CO2 2 vibration is very small (namely 0.88 in 667 cm-1), or in other 

words, the degeneracy of the bending vibration is only slightly lifted. Thus it is not surprising 

that we observe a -value close to 1.0 for CO2-Ar. In fact, the b parameters from Table 1 result 

in values of about 1.01 for , depending slightly on exactly which value is used for B. A value 

greater than unity is not normally possible within the harmonic approximation, but we can 

ascribe the slightly larger value found here to the floppy nature of CO2-Ar. In the case of C2H2-

Ar, Ohshima et al.1 determined a more anomalous -value of about 1.52, and also found that 

  8 

their fit required relatively large second order and centrifugal distortion corrections to . Such 

corrections were not required here. These differences between CO2-Ar and C2H2-Ar are 

consistent with the fact that C2H2-Ar is considerably less rigid, as manifested shown for example 

by its much lower energy intermolecular bending mode (6.2 cm-1)26 compared to CO2-Ar (27.8 

cm-1).8 

We estimate the strongest lines in the observed CO2-Ar (0111)  (0110) hot band to be 

about 0.022 times the strength of those in the (001)  (000) fundamental band, though this is 

rather uncertain due to possible changes in laser output power and supersonic jet conditions. The 

jet nozzle is at room temperature, where the population in each of the degenerate (0110) modes 

of CO2 is about 0.038 times that of the (000) ground state, for a total of 0.076. Following the 

supersonic expansion and formation of CO2-Ar, the effective rotational temperature is about 1.8 

K, and some of the population of the o-p mode has relaxed into the lower energy i-p mode, so 

that the i-p component of the spectrum is stronger, as seen in Fig. 1. Putting these observations 

together, we can say that the observed strength of the CO2-Ar (0111)  (0110) hot band is about 

half (very roughly!) of the maximum value that would be observed if all the original (0110) state 

population of CO2 survived the supersonic expansion without any relaxation. Thus it seems that 

the vibrational relaxation of the (0110) mode is relatively inefficient. This is probably due to the 

fact that our expansion gas mixture is mostly (>99%) helium, and that He – CO2 collisions are 

relatively inefficient at removing the 667 cm-1 energy of the CO2 2 vibration. 

The key parameter in our results is the splitting between i-p and o-p modes, which is 

determined to be 0.8773(1) cm-1 in the lower (0110) state and 0.8764(1) cm-1 in the upper (0111) 

state, with i-p lying below o-p. This rather basic aspect of intermolecular interactions in weakly-

bound complexes containing linear molecules has received little or no theoretical consideration 

  9 

in the past, especially considering the many theoretical studies of CO2-Ar. The only similar 

experimental result,1 for 5 of C2H2-Ar, involved the same ordering (i-p below o-p), but with a 

smaller splitting of just 0.138 cm-1. Because of the nature of our spectrum, we only determine the 

splittings, not the overall shift of the CO2 2 mode in CO2-Ar (this overall shift is contained in 

the unknown parameter X in Table 1). But we do determine the shift of the (0111)  (0110) hot 

band origin relative to the free CO2 monomer,27 which is -0.464 cm-1. This shift is virtually the 

same for the i-p and o-p modes, and is very similar to that of the (001)  (000) fundamental 

band, -0.470 cm-1, as determined by Randall et al.6 This similarity and the similarity of the 

splitting in the lower and upper states indicate that the coupling of the 2 and 3 modes in CO2 

remains almost unaffected in CO2-Ar. 

How can we understand the sign and magnitude of the symmetry breaking splitting? 

Compared to the o-p mode, the i-p mode seemingly involves moving the C atom to “crash into” 

the Ar atom once every vibration. So, one might think that the relatively steep repulsive wall of 

the intermolecular potential would tend to increase the i-p frequency relative to the o-p, contrary 

to our observation. We undertook some straightforward ab initio calculations to investigate this 

question. Using Gaussian 16 at the MP2/cc-pvtz level, we obtained values of 654.8 and 655.7 

cm-1 for the i-p and o-p modes, respectively. Moving to higher levels of theory, we obtained 

659.6 and 660.3 cm-1 using fc-CCSD(T)/ccpVTZ, and 662.3 and 663.8 cm-1 using fc-

CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ. All the calculations gave values close to 1.0 for the Coriolis zeta 

parameter as we expected. In addition, all these calculations agreed with experiment in sign (o-p 

above i-p) and (approximately) magnitude (values from 0.7 to 1.5 cm-1), showing that theory at 

the harmonic level does capture the essential result. But the calculation at the highest level 

(CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ) was actually the worst, showing that there is at least some accidental 

  10 

cancellation of errors going on. The problem, of course, is that we are dealing with a floppy, 

weakly-bound, van der Waals complex. So even though the intramolecular CO2 bending motion 

is reasonably harmonic, the intermolecular CO2-Ar stretching and (especially) bending modes 

are not. A full calculation will first require reliable ab initio calculation of the CO2-Ar 

intermolecular potential as a function of the intermolecular distance and angle, and then a 

detailed dynamical calculation, essentially integration of the CO2 2 mode splitting over these 

two intermolecular motions. 

3.3. Conclusions 

Since we now have parameters for CO2-Ar in the CO2 (0110) state which are complete 

except for X, it is possible to predict the CO2-Ar spectrum in the region of the CO2 2 

fundamental band, as shown in Fig. 3. Here, we assume a rotational temperature of 1.8 K and 

also assume equal transition moments for the i-p and o-p components, which have a- and c-type 

selection rules, respectively. As we know the two components are highly mixed, so the spectrum 

is distorted from a normal appearance and many individual transitions have a contribution from 

both components. The most prominent features are the P- and R-branches of the i-p K = 0  0 

subband, the Q- branch of the o-p K = 1  0 subband, and the R-branch of the o-p K = 3  2 

subband. In this simulation, we assume that X, the overall vibrational shift of the i-p 2 mode in 

CO2-Ar, is zero. So the real spectrum, when it is observed, will be moved up or down by X cm-1 

compared to that in Fig. 3. 

The present results show that, under suitable jet expansion conditions, sufficient 

population remains in the first excited bending state of CO2 (0110) to enable observation of the 

(0111)  (0110) hot band of CO2-Ar, and thus to determine the splitting of the degenerate 

bending mode into in-plane and out-of-plane components. Similar results should be possible for 

other weakly-bound complexes containing CO2, and perhaps for complexes containing related 

linear triatomic molecules such as N2O, OCS, and CS2. This opens up an aspect of 

intermolecular interactions for which there has been little or no previous theoretical 

  11 

consideration.

shift which is unlikely to be more than a few cm-1.

Fig. 1.  Observed and simulated spectra of CO2-Ar in the region of the CO2 (0111)  (0110) hot 

band. Gaps in the observed spectrum correspond to regions of CO2 monomer absorption. 

Arrows indicate the first line(s) of the R-branch (for K = +1 subbands) or P-branch (for 

K = -1 subbands). Division of the spectrum into in-plane and out-of-plane components is 

somewhat arbitrary because of the large Coriolis mixing of these modes. 

Fig. 2.  Rotational energy levels of CO2-Ar in the CO2 (0110) (left) and (0111) (right) vibrational 

states, illustrating the large Coriolis interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane modes. 

These are “reduced” energies levels with the basic rotational dependence, ½(B + C)  J(J 

+ 1), subtracted for clarity (with ½(B + C) = 0.061078 cm-1). The in-plane mode is shown 

in black (Coriolis interaction on) and blue (Coriolis interaction off). The out-of-plane 

mode is shown in red (Coriolis interaction on) and green (Coriolis interaction off). The 

energy zeros are the in-plane mode origins from Table 1, equal to X cm-1 for the (0110) 

state or (2336.1692 + X) cm-1 for the (0111) state. In the lower (0110) state, the K = 1 and 

2 levels lie close together and experience particularly large Coriolis mixing. In the upper 

(0110) state, the interaction between K = 0 and 1, and between K = 2 and 3, become more 

important. 

Fig. 3  Predicted spectrum of CO2-Ar in the region of the CO2 2 fundamental band at a 

temperature of 1.8 K. Here it is assumed that the unknown shift (X in Table 1) of the in-

plane mode relative to the free CO2 molecule is zero. So the actual spectrum, which is not 

yet observed, may be shifted up or down by one or two cm-1 from this simulation.
