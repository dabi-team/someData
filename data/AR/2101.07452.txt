ABSTRACT
Major ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) tend to originate from the compact polarity inver-
sion lines (PILs) in the solar active regions (ARs). Recently, a scenario named as “collisional shearing”
is proposed by Chintzoglou et al. (2019) to explain the phenomenon, which suggests that the collision
between diﬀerent emerging bipoles is able to form the compact PIL, driving the shearing and ﬂux
cancellation that are responsible to the subsequent large activities. In this work, through tracking the
evolution of 19 emerging ARs from their birth until they produce the ﬁrst major ﬂares or CMEs, we in-
vestigated the source PILs of the activities, i.e., the active PILs, to explore the generality of “collisional
shearing”. We ﬁnd that none of the active PILs is the self PIL (sPIL) of a single bipole. We further
ﬁnd that 11 eruptions originate from the collisional PILs (cPILs) formed due to the collision between
diﬀerent bipoles, 6 from the conjoined systems of sPIL and cPIL, and 2 from the conjoined systems of
sPIL and ePIL (external PIL between the AR and the nearby preexisting polarities). Collision accom-
panied by shearing and ﬂux cancellation is found developing at all PILs prior to the eruptions, with
84% (16/19) cases having collisional length longer than 18 Mm. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the magnitude
of the ﬂares is positively correlated with the collisional length of the active PILs, indicating that the
intenser activities tend to originate from the PILs with severer collision. The results suggest that the
“collisional shearing”, i.e., bipole-bipole interaction during the ﬂux emergence is a common process in
driving the major activities in emerging ARs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are
among the most violent activities in the solar atmo-
sphere. Their main producers are known to be the solar
active regions (ARs). It is generally accepted that the
ARs are formed by the magnetic ﬂux emerging from the
solar interior. The emergence of a single Ω-shaped ﬂux
tube can form the simplest bipolar region, the two po-
larities of which are the intersections between the tube
axial ﬁeld and the photosphere (Schmieder et al. 2014,
and reference therein). During the emergence, the two
main polarities move apart, with typical signatures such
as small moving dipoles (small opposite-sign polarity
pairs) appearing between them (e.g., Strous & Zwaan
1999, Bernasconi et al. 2002, Centeno 2012). Diﬀerent
bipoles can interact to form complex conﬁguration, such
as quadrupolar conﬁguration.

Observationally, not all ARs are able to generate large
ﬂares or CMEs. It is found that the eruption-producing
ARs tend to be larger, containing larger amount of mag-
netic free energy, hosting more complex conﬁguration
than a single bipole (e.g., Falconer et al. 2002, Leka et al.
2003, Falconer et al. 2006, Leka & Barnes 2007, Geor-
goulis & Rust 2007, Falconer et al. 2008, Chen et al.
2011, Liu et al. 2016). Enough free energy is only a nec-
essary condition for the AR to produce major ﬂares or
CMEs. The trigger of the activities may involve more
complex process such as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
instabilities (e.g., T¨or¨ok et al. 2004, Kliem & T¨or¨ok
2006) and magnetic reconnection (e.g., Antiochos et al.
1999, Moore et al. 2001). Considering the evolution of
the ARs, their ability to produce eruptions increases
as the ﬂux emergence proceeds (van Driel-Gesztelyi &
Green 2015, and reference therein). Although the de-
caying ARs can also produce eruptions mainly due to
ﬂux cancellation (magnetic reconnection near the pho-
tosphere), the most violent activities tend to originate
from the still emerging and evolving ARs (Schrijver
2009).

The lines where the polarities change signs are called
polarity inversion lines (PILs). It is found that within
the eruption-producing ARs, compact PILs,
i.e., the
PILs with high spatial gradient, are usually the sources
of major ﬂares and CMEs (Schrijver 2007). Shearing
motions and sunspot rotations can always be found near
the compact PILs. Those motions are suggested to be
able to shear or twist the ﬁeld lines so that to inject
the free energy and magnetic helicity into the AR (e.g.,
Fan 2009, Yan et al. 2015), being closely related to the
eruptions. Converging motions and ﬂux cancellation are
also frequently observed (e.g., Green et al. 2011, Cheng
et al. 2014). In the classical ﬂux cancellation model of
the single bipolar region (van Ballegooijen & Martens
1989), converging motions can bring the opposite-sign
footpoints of diﬀerent loops of the sheared arcade to-
gether, leading to ﬂux cancellation which forms the ﬂux
rope (a set of helical ﬁeld lines winding around a com-
mon axis). The subsequent eruption of the ﬂux rope may
form the CME, and generate the ﬂare through magnetic
reconnection (e.g., Shibata et al. 1995).

Combining the shearing motion, converging motion
and ﬂux cancellation in the emerging ARs, Chintzoglou
et al. (2019) proposed a new scenario to explain the com-
pact PIL formation and the origin of the major solar
activities. Through tracking the evolution of two ﬂare-
and CME-productive ARs from the very beginning of
their emergence, the authors found that the clusters of
the eruptions correlated well with the onset of a pro-
cess named as “collisional shearing”. During the “col-
lisional shearing”, diﬀerent bipoles appear on the pho-
tosphere due to the emergence of diﬀerent ﬂux tubes.
For each bipole, the two main polarities move apart as
the two legs of the ﬂux tube separate during the emer-
gence. The separation results in converging motions,
thus collision, between the nonconjugated opposite-sign
polarities, forming the compact PIL. The continuous col-
lision further drives shearing and ﬂux cancellation, lead-
ing to the magnetic reconnection and the formation of
ﬂux ropes, followed by a series of large activities. This
kind of compact PIL formed due to collision between
non-conjugated polarities is deﬁned as collisional PIL
(cPIL), diﬀerentiating from the self PIL (sPIL) formed
between the conjugated polarities (all deﬁned in Chint-
zoglou et al. 2019). The authors pointed out that the
overall PIL in the AR was naturally an integral system
of sPIL and cPIL. They further identiﬁed two types of
collisional shearing patterns, case A and case B. In case
A, the two bipoles emerge simultaneously, driving the
collision by self-separation. In case B, the two bipoles
emerge sequentially, followed by the collision. On the
contrast to the eruption models considering the bipolar
ARs (e.g., van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989, Fan 2001),
the bipole-bipole interaction plays the major role in the
collisional shearing scenario.

Liu et al. (2019) also reported that during the early
emergence phase of NOAA AR 12673, a magnetic ﬂux

rope above the AR’s central PIL was formed through
ﬂux cancellation and shearing during the “collisional
shearing”. They further suggested that the subsequent
recurrent eruptions and ﬂux ropes reformation were
driven by the same process. Both works indicate that
the “collisional shearing” may be important in driving
large solar activities in emerging ARs. However, no sta-
tistical study on this phenomenon has been done accord-
ing to our best knowledge. In this work, we perform a
statistical research on the evolution of 19 ARs from their
birth until they produce the ﬁrst major activity, i.e., a
large ﬂare (≥M1.0 class) or a CME, to explore the gen-
erality of the “collisional shearing”. We mainly focus
on the properties of the source PILs of those activities,
which are named as active PILs in the following.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we de-
scribe the event sample, the data and the method we use.
The statistical result and typical examples are presented
in Section 3. We give the discussions and conclusions in
Section 4.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA ANALYSIS

The 19 ARs we studied are selected from the list pre-
sented in Kutsenko et al. (2019), which contains 423
emerging ARs observed by the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board So-
lar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).
Our ARs fulﬁll the following criteria: the AR should
emerge and generate at least one major ﬂare (≥M1.0
class, either conﬁned or not) or CME within the re-
gion between Stonyhurst longitudes 60◦E and 60◦W
(roughly having disk-centered angle Θ ≤ 60◦). The
criteria ensure a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio of
the HMI data, as the data taken near the solar limb
are subjected to severe uncertainties and projection ef-
fect. We check the ﬂares in the soft X-ray (SXR)
ﬂare catalog of the Geostationary Operational Environ-
mental Satellite (GOES)1. The CMEs are examined in
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Large
Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) CME
catalog maintained at the Coordinated Data Analysis
Workshop (CDAW) data center2 (Gopalswamy et al.
2009), and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory
(STEREO)/Sun–Earth Connection Coronal and Helio-
spheric Investigation (SECCHI) COR2 CME catalog
that is recorded by the Solar Eruptive Event Detection
System (SEEDS) maintained by the George Mason Uni-
versity3 (Olmedo et al. 2008). The basic properties of
the ARs and their ﬁrst major activities are given in Ta-
ble 1.

We use a data product from the SDO/HMI called
Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs;
Hoeksema et al. 2014, Bobra et al. 2014) to track the
evolution of the ARs. The SHARP data series pro-
duces cutout maps of the automatically tracked ARs for
their entire transit, providing the photospheric vector
magnetic ﬁeld as well as the line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms with a spatial resolution of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 and a time
cadence of 12 minutes. A speciﬁc version of the SHARP
data, which is remapped from the CCD coordinates to
the heliographic Cylindrical Equal-Area (CEA) projec-
tion coordinates, is used. To locate the exact source
PILs of the ﬁrst major activities, we inspect the ex-
treme ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) images
provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) on board SDO. The images have a
spatial resolution of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 and a time cadence up to 12 sec-
onds. We mainly use the hot passband 131 ˚A (∼10 MK)
and the cool passband 304 ˚A (∼50000K) to show the
eruption details. If the eruption signatures are not clear
enough in the two passbands, the 211 ˚A passband (∼2.0
MK) is further used to show the possible coronal dim-
mings associated with the CMEs.

We follow the methods employed in (Chintzoglou
et al. 2019) to quantify the “collisional shearing” pro-
cess. Speciﬁcally, we calculate the magnetic ﬂux of the
AR, track all polarities involved, and identify the col-
lisional portions of the active PILs using the SHARP
data. The radial component of the vector ﬁeld, Br, is
a natural choice to do the analysis. However, the noise
level of the vector ﬁeld is as high as 100 G (Hoeksema
et al. 2014), and is severe in the regions beyond 30◦
from the disk center. The other choice is to use the low
noise (as low as 10 G) radialized LOS magnetic ﬁeld
data, i.e, the LOS data corrected by dividing the cosine
of the angle between LOS and local normal of the disk
(BLOS = Braw
LOS is the raw LOS
data).
In the following, the mentioned Blos indicates
the data after correction. Nevertheless, the correction
assumes that the horizontal component of the magnetic
ﬁeld (Bh) contributes much less to Blos than the vertical
component (Br), which may not hold when the AR is
not near the disk center. The uncertainty introduced by
the correction is hard to be estimated without low noise
Bh. Overall, the two datasets (Br and Blos) are safe to
be used in the region having disk-centered angle ≤ 30◦,
but have diﬀerent ﬂaws out of the region. We thus re-
peat the analysis on both datasets for comparison.

LOS/ cos θ, in which Braw

The ﬂux-weighted centroid for each polarity is calcu-
lated within a radius of 5 Mm (about 14 pixels) around
its peak intensity (used in Chintzoglou et al. 2019). Note
that, some like-signed polarities from diﬀerent bipoles
may be extremely close to each other, having insepara-
ble boundaries, thus are called as a group (deﬁned in
Chintzoglou et al. 2019). Based on the time-series cen-
troids, we plot the trajectory of each centroid and the
evolution of distances between diﬀerent centroids.

We further quantify the collision strength and the non-
potential shear of the active PILs. The collision strength
is characterized by the length of the collisional, i.e., com-
pact, high spatial gradient part of the PIL that is ob-
tained by the method described in Schrijver (2007) and
Chintzoglou et al. (2019). For the polarities forming the
active PIL, the strong ﬁeld regions (kernels) are ﬁrstly
isolated with various thresholds, then dilated by the ker-
nel with a size of 5 pixels (the size used in Chintzoglou
et al. 2019). The region where the positive and neg-
ative polarities intersect is taken as the primary colli-
sional PIL part, same as in Chintzoglou et al. (2019). A
thinning operation is further performed until the part is
one-pixel wide (see details in Chintzoglou et al. 2019),
which is taken as the ﬁnal collisional PIL part. All pixels
of the collisional part are summed up to get its length,
LcP IL. Here various thresholds are used to avoid the
bias, which are 100 G, 125 G, 150 G and 175 G for Br,
and are 50 G, 75 G, 100 G, 125 G, 150 G and 175 G
for Blos. As the collision is detected through the di-
lation of strong ﬁeld kernel, the threshold lower than
50 Gauss may not ﬁt the deﬁnition of strong ﬁeld, and
larger than 175 Gauss may unnecessarily reduce the col-
lisional length. The reason for not using 50 G and 75 G
for Br is that they are lower than the noise level of Br.
It is found that all thresholds yield the similar results
(see Section 3.4). We thus present the results of Br at
100 Gauss (threshold used in Chintzoglou et al. 2019)
for simplicity when showing the examples.

The non-potential shear is characterized by the mean
shear angle S of the ﬁeld at the collisional PIL part.
To calculate the mean shear angle, we ﬁrstly com-
pute the potential ﬁeld with the frourier transformation
method (Alissandrakis 1981) using photospheric Br as
the input, then calculate the mean shear angle S by the

equation S =

N

Σarccos(

BObs · Bpot
|BObs||BP ot|

) (Bobra et al.

2014), in which N is the number of the pixels of the
collisional part of the PIL, BObs is the observed vector
magnetic ﬁeld, and Bpot is the extrapolated potential
ﬁeld. For the LOS ﬁeld dataset, S is calculated in the
same way using the collisional pixels identiﬁed on Blos
maps.

We further inspect the diﬀerence between the param-
eters obtained on Br and Blos datasets. For two values
calculated on diﬀerent datasets at the same time, their

percentage diﬀerence is measured as r =

plos − pr
pr

×

100%, in which plos and pr indicate LcP IL or S obtained
on Blos and Br, respective. The overall diﬀerence is
then calculated as the mean value of the percentage dif-

ferences of all data by
Σr, in which N is the number
of data points from the ﬂux emergence start to the ﬂare
onset.

3. RESULTS

We track the ARs and locate the active PILs where the
ﬁrst major activities originate. For an AR, except the
sPIL and cPIL (deﬁned in Chintzoglou et al. 2019), there
may be another type of PIL formed between the AR and
the nearby preexisting polarities, deﬁned as the exter-
nal PIL (ePIL, Mackay et al. 2008, Chintzoglou et al.
2019). We ﬁnd that the active PILs in our sample could
be classiﬁed into three types: cPIL, of which the PILs
are complete collisional PILs; the conjoined sPIL/cPIL,
in which the PILs are the combination of the self PILs
and collisional PILs; the conjoined sPIL/ePIL, in which
the PILs are the integral systems of the self PILs and
external PILs. Finally, we get 11 cPILs, 6 conjoined
sPIL/cPIL and 2 conjoined sPIL/ePIL. Their informa-
tion is shown in Table 1. Eight typical examples are
given in the following.

3.1. Examples of cPILs

THE CPIL IN NOAA AR 11162

NOAA AR 11162 is composed of two bipoles emerging
sequentially. Its collisional shearing case is case B. From
the the ﬂux emergence start to the ﬂare onset, the AR
transits from Stonyhurst longitude 10◦E to 0◦E, with its
disk centered angle changing from 28.1◦ to 26.3◦. The
evolution of the AR is shown in Figure 1, in which the
Br magnetograms, the polarities centroids and their dis-
tances obtained on Br, and the length and shear angle
of the collisional PIL parts detected at 100 G on both
Br and Blos datasets are displayed. We determine the
conjugated polarities of a bipole according to three cri-
teria: ﬁrstly, the two polarities emerge at the same time;
secondly, they move apart from each other; thirdly, typ-
ical signatures such as moving dipoles appear between
them.

The ﬁrst bipole, named as bipole A, starts to emerge
at around 2011-02-17T15:34. Four hours later, the other
bipole, bipole B emerges at the west of bipole A, with its
positive polarity (PB in Figure 1) locating close to the
negative polarity of bipole A (NA in Figure 1). As emer-
gence goes on, the conjugated polarities of each bipole
separate, rendering the nonconjugated NA and PB to
approach each other. The PIL between NA and PB is
the active PIL (cyan line in Figure 1). On the PIL, col-
lisional signature appears and grows gradually (red line
part in Figure 1). Clear disappearance of the negative
polarities is observed near the PIL (enclosed in magenta
circle in Figure 1), indicating the ﬂux cancellation. We
further track the motion of the ﬂux-weighted centroids of
all polarities and show their trajectories in Figure 1(g).
The centroid of NA moves northwestward, while that
of PA ﬁrstly moves southwestward then northeastward.
Meanwhile, the centroid of NB moves westward, while
that of PB moves eastward. NA and PB slightly ap-
proach and shear against each other. Since the active
PIL is formed by the collision of nonconjugated polari-
ties, we classify it as a cPIL.

The evolution of the distances between the polari-
ties further proves the “separation and collision” pro-
cess (Figure 1(h)). From the ﬂux emergence start to
the ﬂare onset, both the distances between the conju-
gated polarities of biople A and bipole B increase. The
former increases from 19.8 Mm to 31.1 Mm, while the
latter grows from 18.7 Mm to 31.0 Mm. The distance
between NA and PB slightly decreases from 20.5 Mm
to 18.3 Mm. When the ﬁrst major activity occurs, the
AR grows into a medium sized region with the unsigned
magnetic ﬂux of 8.0 × 1021 Mx (Figure 1(i)). The length
of the collisional PIL part (LcP IL) obtained on Br se-
ries has increased from 27.8 Mm to 91.0 Mm, whilst the
mean shear angle (S) increases from 64.1◦ to 77.3◦. The
LcP IL and S obtained on Blos series show the similar
trend. The former increase from 18.5 Mm to 88.3 Mm,
and the latter increases from 54.4◦ to 72.2◦. The overall
diﬀerence between LcP IL on the two datasets is −24.5%,
and that for S is −10.0%, indicating both parameters
obtained on Blos are overall smaller than those obtained
on Br at the same threshold in this event.

The ﬁrst major eruption from the AR is an M1.0 class
ﬂare accompanied by the failed eruption of a ﬁlament
which launches at 2011-02-18T10:23 (Figure 2). In both
the hot and cool AIA channels, 131 ˚A and 304 ˚A pass-
bands, the eruption of the ﬁlament is observed occur-
ring above the cPIL between NA and PB (blue lines in
Figure 2). The brightenings at the PIL, and the ﬂar-
ing ribbons occurring at both sides of the cPIL in the
1600 ˚A passband (black contours in Figure 2) conﬁrm
that the cPIL is the source of the eruption.

THE CPIL IN NOAA AR 11891

NOAA AR 11891 starts to emerge from around 2013-
11-05T12:48. It transits from the Stonyhurst longitude
09◦E to 31◦W until the ﬁrst major activity, with the
disk centered angle changing from 24.5◦ to 36.8◦. The
evolution of the AR is shown in Figure 3. Two bipoles,
named as bipole A and bipole B, appear on the photo-
sphere simultaneously. Its collisional shearing case be-
longs to case A. The conjugated polarities of each bipole
move apart from each other, while the positive polarity
of bipole A (PA) and the negative polarity of bipole B
(NB) approach each other (see Figure 3(a)-(f) and the
associated movie). The PIL between the two noncon-
jugated polarities is the active PIL (cyan lines in Fig-
ure 3(a)-(f)). Collisional signatures gradually appear on
the PIL (red line parts in Figure 3(a)-(f)).
It is thus
classiﬁed as a cPIL. During the collision, the conjugated
polarities of the two bipoles keep separating, so that
the nonconjugated polarities PA and NB shear against
each other. Shrinkage of the negative polarities is ob-
served near the PIL (enclosed in magenta circles in Fig-
ure 3), indicating the ﬂux cancellation. The trajectories
of the ﬂux-weighted centroids of the polarities conﬁrm
the above process (Figure 3(g)). PA moves northwest-
ward while NA moves northeastward. PB moves west-

ward while NB moves southeastward. The nonconju-
gated PA and NB ﬁrstly approach and then slide away
from each other. The slight discontinuity of the trajec-
tories is resulted from the jump change of the positions
of the centroids.

Until the ﬂare, the distance between PA and NA in-
creases from 15.1 Mm to 36.5 Mm, and that between
PB and NB increases from 23.3 Mm to 44.2 Mm, con-
ﬁrming the separation of the conjugated polarities (Fig-
ure 3(h)). The distance between PA and NB ﬁrstly
decreases from 13.5 Mm to 6.1 Mm, then increases to
16.0 Mm, consistent with their collision and shearing
away motion. The unsigned magnetic ﬂux of the AR in-
creases to 7.7 × 1021 Mx (Figure 3(i)). The length of the
collisional PIL part obtained on Br series increases from
10.9 Mm to 43.0 Mm and the mean shear angle increases
from 60.2◦ to 68.1◦. The LcP IL obtained on Blos also
increases from 12.8 Mm to 52.0 Mm, while S slightly
decreases from 60.0◦ to 52.8◦. The overall diﬀerence of
LcP IL from the two datasets is 25.3%, while that of S
is −10.9%, indicating that in this case, compared to the
values obtained from Br, the LcP IL obtained from Blos
is larger whilst S is smaller.

The ﬁrst major eruption from this AR is an M2.3 class
ﬂare which starts from 2013-11-08T09:22. It is accom-
panied by a CME propagating away with a velocity of
around 207 km s−1 (see also Table 1). Brightenings at
the cPIL between PA and NB are observed in both the
131 ˚A passband and 304 ˚A passband, revealing that the
eruption initiates from here (Figure 4). Moreover, mass
eruption is seen in the 304 ˚A passband (Figure 4(g)).
Post-ﬂare loops appear across the PIL in the 131 ˚A pass-
band after the ﬂare (Figure 4(e)). The ﬂaring ribbons
appear at both sides of the cPIL in the 1600 ˚A passband
(black contours in Figure 4), conﬁrming that the cPIL
is the eruption source.

THE CPIL IN NOAA AR 12089

NOAA AR 12089 is composed of two bipoles, bipole A
and bipole B, which start to emerge from around 2014-
06-10T20:22 simultaneously. Its collisional shearing case
belongs to case A. Until the ﬂare, the AR crosses the re-
gion between Stonyhurst longitude 31◦E to 28◦E, with
the disk-centered angle changing from 35.2◦ to 33.6◦.
The nonconjugated polarities NA and PB stays quite
close (Figure 5(a)-(f)), so that the PIL between them
is classiﬁed as a cPIL. The ﬁrst major activity occurs
only 4 hours after the emergence onset, thus the conju-
gated polarities do not separate too much as shown by
their ﬂux-weighted centroids trajectories (Figure 5(g)).
The PA slightly moves to the northeast while NA moves
northwestward. In the meantime, PB moves southward
whilst NB moves westward. The distance between PA
and NA slightly increases from 12.1 Mm to 13.5 Mm,
and that between PB and NB remains around 11.8 Mm
(Figure 5(h)). NA and PB also has a distance remain-
ing around 6.0 Mm, supporting that the two polarities

5

are quite close from their emergence. Until the ﬂare,
the AR is still small, having unsigned magnetic ﬂux of
1.2 × 1021 Mx (Figure 5 (i)). The length of the cPIL
between NA and PB (obtained on Br) increases from
1.1 Mm to 9.8 Mm, and the mean shear angle ﬂuctu-
ates slightly around 55.0◦. For LcP IL and S obtained
on Blos, the former increases from 1.5 Mm to 12.9 Mm,
and the latter also ﬂuctuates slightly around 55◦. The
overall diﬀerence of the two sets of LcP IL is −5.8%, while
that of S is 4.1%, which are all relatively small.

The ﬁrst major activity from the AR is a CME prop-
agating with a velocity of around 343 km s−1, accom-
panied by a C2.1 class ﬂare which starts from 2014-
In the AIA 131 ˚A passband,
06-10T23:46 (Figure 6).
brightenings are observed occurring at the cPIL between
NA and PB. Clear dimmings are observed near the cPIL
in the AIA 211 ˚A passband, which indicates the mass de-
pletion during the CME. The ﬂaring ribbons occurring
along both sides of the cPIL in the 1600 ˚A passband
conﬁrms that it is the source PIL.

THE CONJOINED SPIL/CPIL IN NOAA AR 11081

NOAA AR 11081 presents a multi-polar conﬁguration,
which is composed of more than three bipoles emerg-
ing sequentially. We focus on the two lately emerged
bipoles which are named as bipole A and bipole B.
From the emergence until the ﬂare, the AR transits from
the Stonyhurst longitude 38◦W to 49◦W, with the disk-
centered angle changing from 43.4◦ to 51.9◦. Bipole A
starts to emerge from around 2010-06-11T06:22 (see Fig-
ure 7(a)-(f)). About 9 hours later, bipole B starts to
emerge at the west of bipole A, with both its polari-
ties (PB and NB) located close to the negative polarity
of bipole A (NA). As emergence goes on, NA gradually
intrudes in between PB and NB. A PIL can be drawn
between PB and the group of NB and NA (cyan line
in Figure 7), which is the active PIL of the AR. Col-
lisional signatures appear on it (red line parts in Fig-
ure 7). Shrinkage of the positive polarities is also ob-
served (enclosed in magenta circles in Figure 7), indi-
cating the ﬂux cancellation. Since the PIL is an integral
system of the sPIL between PB and NB and the cPIL
between PB and NA (ﬁrstly identiﬁed in Chintzoglou
et al. 2019), it is classiﬁed as a conjoined sPIL/cPIL. The
trajectories of the ﬂux-weighted centroids exhibit that
PA moves northeastward while NA moves southwest-
ward. PB ﬁrstly moves to the northwest then reverses
toward the southwest, while NB moves southwestward
(Figure 7(g)).

Until the ﬂare, the distance between PA and NA in-
creases from 25.4 Mm to 52.4 Mm, and that between NB
and PB increases from 13.4 Mm to 24.0 Mm, support-
ing the separation of conjugated polarities (Figure 7(h)).
The distance between NA and PB remains relatively in-
variant around 10 Mm, which indicates that the collision

6

starts with the emergence of bipole B. The collisional
shearing case thus is case B. The unsigned magnetic
ﬂux of the AR grows to 8.5 × 1021 Mx (Figure 7(i)).
The length of the collisional PIL part obtained on Br
increases from 25.1 Mm to 70.8 Mm, and the mean
shear angle slightly increases from 54.9◦ to 62.1◦. LcP IL
and S obtained on Blos show the similar trend. The
former increases from 11.1 Mm to 66.8 Mm, and the
latter increases from 37.6◦ to 52.0◦. The diﬀerence of
LcP IL from the two datasets is −16.3%, and that of S is
−27.1%, indicating that the values from Blos are smaller
compared to the ones from Br in this event.

The ﬁrst major activity of the AR is an M2.0 class
ﬂare starts from 2010-06-12T00:30, accompanied by a
CME propagating away with a velocity of 486 km s−1
(Figure 8). In both the AIA 131 ˚A and 304 ˚A passbands,
brightenings and mass eruption are observed near the
active PIL. The ﬂaring ribbons in the 1600 ˚A passband
appear at both sides of the PIL, conﬁrming it is the
eruption source.

THE CONJOINED SPIL/CPIL IN NOAA AR 11440

NOAA AR 11440 transits from the Stonyhurst longi-
tude 00◦E to 19◦W until the ﬂare, with its disk-centered
angle changing from 18.1◦ to 24.9◦. It exhibits a multi-
polar conﬁguration, which can be roughly divided into
three bipoles (Figure 9(a)-(f)). We focus on the two
bipoles which emerge from around 2012-03-21T02:58,
named as bipole A and bipole B. They emerge simulta-
neously. The collisional shearing case is case A. Bipole B
is located at the west of bipole A, being closer to PA. As
emergence goes on, PA moves in between PB and NB,
forming a PIL between NB and the group of PA and
PB (cyan line in Figure 9). Collision signatures are ob-
served on the PIL from the early stage of the emergence
(red line part in Figure 9). Disappearance of small po-
larities patches, which indicates the ﬂux cancellation, is
observed at the PIL (see the movie associated with Fig-
ure 9). Since the PIL is an integral system of sPIL and
cPIL, we classify it as a conjoined sPIL/cPIL. The tra-
jectories of the ﬂux-weighted centroids of the polarities
show that (Figure 9(g)), PA moves westward while NA
moves southeastward; PB moves northwestward while
NB moves eastward.

Until the ﬂare, the distance between PA and NA in-
creases from 13.1 Mm to 28.1 Mm (Figure 9(h)), and
that between PB and NB increases from 16.2 Mm to
27.1 Mm. The distance between PA and NB remains al-
most unchanged around 10 Mm. The results prove the
separation between the conjugated polarities, and quite
close distance between PA and NB from the emergence
onset. The AR grows into a medium sized region with
the unsigned magnetic ﬂux of 3.4×1021 Mx (Figure 9(i)).
The length of the collisional PIL parts obtained on Br
increases from 2.9 Mm to 25.6 Mm, and the mean shear
angle remains almost invariant around 60◦. For Blos
dataset, LcP IL also increases from 6.8 Mm to 29.8 Mm,

while S remains around 60◦. The diﬀerence of LcP IL
and S on the two datasets are 10.6% and −7.9%, re-
spective, indicating the increase of LcP IL and decrease
of S when changing the dataset from Br to Blos in this
event.

The ﬁrst major activity from the AR is a slow CME
with a velocity of 387 km s−1, associated with a C2.9
class ﬂare starting from 2012-03-21T12:38 (Figure 10).
In both AIA 131 ˚A and 304 ˚A passbands, mass eruption
is observed at the source PIL. Flaring ribbons along both
sides of the PIL are observed in the AIA 1600 ˚A pass-
band (black contours in Figure 10), conﬁrming it is the
eruption source.

THE CONJOINED SPIL/CPIL IN NOAA AR 11776

NOAA AR 11776 transits from the Stonyhurst longi-
tude 11◦E to 03◦E until the ﬂare, with its disk-centered
angle changing from 14.4◦ to 10.0◦. It is composed of
two bipoles, bipole A and bipole B, which starts to
emerge from around 2013-06-18T07:12 (Figure 11) si-
multaneously. The collisional shearing case is case A.
The negative polarities of the two bipoles reside close to
each other. As emergence goes on, the conjugated polar-
ities of each bipole separate, the two negative polarities
collide and coalesce with each other. Consequently, no
distinguished boundary between them could be drawn
on the magnetograms. The PIL formed between PB
and the group of NA and NB is the active PIL of the
AR. On the PIL, collisional signatures appear and grow
gradually. It is thus classiﬁed as a conjoined sPIL/cPIL.
Disappearance of the positive polarities is observed (en-
closed in magenta circles in Figure 11), indicating the
ﬂux cancellation. From the trajectories of the ﬂux-
weighted centroids of the polarities (Figure 11(g)) one
can see, PA ﬁrstly moves westward and then turns to
the northeast. PB moves eastward. Both NA and NB
roughly move toward the west, with NB slightly inclin-
ing to the north and NA slightly inclining to the south.
Until the ﬂare, the distance between PA and NA in-
creases from 12.3 Mm to 24.6 Mm, and that of PB
and NB increases from 10.7 Mm to 19.6 Mm (Fig-
ure 11(h)). The distance between NA and PB changes
a little, slightly decreasing from 16.9 Mm to 12.7 Mm,
then increasing to 17.2 Mm again. The results conﬁrm
the separation between the conjugated polarities, and
the collision between PB and the group of NA and NB.
The AR is still small with the unsigned magnetic ﬂux
of 2.0 × 1021 Mx (Figure 11(i)). The length of the colli-
sional PIL part obtained on Br increases from 4.7 Mm
to 19.5 Mm, and the mean shear angle increases from
41.3◦ to 71.2◦. For the Blos dataset, LcP IL also increases
from 3.6 Mm to 18.4 Mm, while S increases from 47.4◦
to 71.6◦. The diﬀerence of LcP IL on the two datasets
is −4.4%, and that for S is 4.8%, which both are quite
small.

The ﬁrst major activity from AR 11776 is a CME ac-
companied by a C2.3 class ﬂare (Figure 12). The CME

runs out with a velocity of around 287 km s−1, with the
associated ﬂare starting from around 2013-06-19T00:50
(see Table 1). During the ﬂare, brightenings are ob-
served at the PIL between PB and the group of NA
and NB in both the AIA 131 ˚A and the 211 ˚A pass-
bands. Moreover, post-ﬂare loops appear along the PIL
(Figure 12(d)). Dimmings are observed in the AIA
211 ˚A passband, verifying the depletion of the mass dur-
ing the CME. The ﬂaring ribbons in the 1600 ˚A pass-
band (black contours in Figure 12) are observed along
the PIL, conﬁrming that it is the eruption source.

3.3. Examples of the conjoined sPIL/ePIL

THE CONJOINED SPIL/EPIL IN NOAA AR 11422

NOAA AR 11422 is a bipolar region which starts to
emerge from around 2012-02-18T09:58 (Figure 13(a)-
(f)). It transits from the Stonyhurst longitude 24◦E to
11◦E until the ﬂare, with the disk-centered angle chang-
ing from 33.2◦ to 25.5◦. An external negative polarity
patch (NE) is preexisting at the north of the bipole.
The PIL formed between the positive polarity PA and
the negative polarities NA and NE is the active PIL
of the AR. Collisional signatures are also observed at
the PIL. The collisional PIL part detected on Br series
at 100 G (red line parts in Figure 13) seems not that
signiﬁcant compared to the entire, longer, PIL (cyan
lines in Figure 13). Note that the strength of the mag-
netic ﬁeld near the two conjoined sPIL/ePIL is lower
compared to the others, therefore the large thresholds
may underestimate their collision. We thus also display
the collisional PIL parts detected at 50 G on Blos for
the sPIL/ePIL case for comparison. It is seen that the
collision detected at lower threshold (purple line parts
in Figure 13(a)-(f)) is apparently longer than the one
detected at higher thresholds (red line parts), mostly
occurring between PA and the external NE. Since the
active PIL contains self part between PA and NA and
external part between PA and NE, it is classiﬁed as a
conjoined sPIL/ePIL.

The trajectories of the ﬂux-weighted centroids of the
polarities show that PA moves northeastward while NA
moves northwestward, separating from each other (Fig-
ure 13(g)), which is conﬁrmed by the evolution of the
distance between them (Figure 13(h)). From the start of
the ﬂux emergence until the ﬂare, the distance between
the polarities increases from 28.6 Mm to 43.8 Mm. The
unsigned magnetic ﬂux of the AR grows to 3.5×1021 Mx
(Figure 13(i)). The length and the mean shear angle of
the collisional PIL part obtained at 100 G on Br re-
main relatively small. The former increases from 3.3 to
10.5 Mm, and the latter slightly increases from 43.2◦ to
49.4◦. The parameters obtained on Blos at 100 G show
the similar trend, with LcP IL increasing from 1.1 Mm to
8.2 Mm, and S increasing from 13.8◦ to 59.7◦. The dif-
ference of LcP IL on the two datasets is −8.7%, and that
of S is −9.0%. When changing the detection threshold

7

to 50 G, the LcP IL is signiﬁcantly longer (Figure 13(i)),
increasing from 3.3 Mm to 34.5 Mm. The shear an-
gle also increases from 37.2◦ to 45.7◦. The results in-
dicate that the collision in the conjoined sPIL/ePIL in
AR 11422 is not trivial.

The ﬁrst major activity from the AR is a slow CME
propagating with a velocity of around 238 km s−1, ac-
companied by a C1.0 class ﬂare which starts from around
2012-02-19T08:41 (See Table 1). The images at both
the AIA 131 ˚A and 211 ˚A passbands clear show that
the eruption generates brightenings along the active PIL
(Figure 14). Post-ﬂare loops across the PIL are also ob-
served (Figure 14(e)). Furthermore, regions of dimming
appear in the 211 ˚A passband, indicating the mass de-
pletion associated with the CME. Flaring ribbons in the
AIA 1600 ˚A passband also appear along the PIL (black
contours in Figure 14), conﬁrming that it is the eruption
source.

THE CONJOINED SPIL/EPIL IN NOAA AR 11870

NOAA AR 11870 transits from the Stonyhurst longi-
tude 14◦E to 28◦W until the ﬂare, with the disk-centered
angle changing from 24.1◦ to 32.5◦. It is a bipolar region
which starts to emerge from around 2013-10-13T06:10
(Figure 15(a)-(f)). A patch of dispersive negative po-
larity is preexisting at its south (NE). The PIL between
PA and the group of NA and NE is the active PIL of the
AR (cyan line in Figure 15(a)-(f)), which is obvious a
conjoined sPIL/ePIL. Collisional signatures also appear
on the PIL. The one detected at higher thresholds of
100 G (on Br, red line parts in Figure 15(a)-(f)) is quite
short compared to the entire PIL. The one detected at
lower thresholds of 50 G (on Blos, purple line parts)
is longer. It is seen that in the early emergence stage
(Figure 15(a)-(c)), quite a part of the collision occurs
between the conjugated PA and NA, while near to the
ﬂare (Figure 15(d)-(f), the most of the collision occurs
between PA and the external NE.

As emergence goes on, the two conjugated polarities
separate (Figure 15(g)). The ﬂux-weighted centroids of
In the rough, PA

moves southwestward, while NA moves to the north at
ﬁrst then turns to southeast. Until the ﬂare, the dis-
tance between PA and NA increases from 25.0 Mm to
53.4 Mm (Figure 13(h)). The unsigned magnetic ﬂux of
the AR grows to 5.1 × 1021 Mx (Figure 15(i)). The
length of the collisional PIL part obtained on Br at
100 G evolves dramatically, increasing from 0.7 Mm to
28.0 Mm, then decreasing to 3.9 Mm. The mean shear
angle increases from 63.0◦ to 84.5◦. The parameters ob-
tained on Blos at 100 G show the similar evolution trend.
The LcP IL ﬁrstly increases from 0.7 Mm to 22.8 Mm,
then decreases to 2.5 Mm until the ﬂare. The S increases
from 53.8◦ to 99.7◦. The diﬀerence of LcP IL on the two
datasets is −12.3%, and that of S is −1.5%. For the
collisional PIL part detected at 50 G on Blos, the LcP IL
also evolves dramatically, increasing from 2.2 Mm to as

8

high as 61.5 Mm, then decreasing to 9.5 Mm until the
ﬂare, similar as the one obtained at the higher thresh-
old. The S increases from around 60.0◦ to 82.5◦. This
indicates that the collision at this sPIL/ePIL is severe
in the early emergence phase, but becomes mild right
before the ﬂare.

The ﬁrst major activity from the AR is a CME with a
velocity of 514 km s−1, accompanied by a C1.8 class ﬂare
starting from 2013-10-16T15:03 (Figure 16).
In both
the AIA 131 ˚A and the 211 ˚A passbands, brightenings
occur along the PIL. After the ﬂare, post-ﬂare loops
across the PIL are observed (Figure 16(e)). Dimming
regions appear in the 211 ˚A passband, which indicate the
mass depletion during the CME. The ﬂaring ribbons in
the 1600 ˚A passband occur along both sides of the PIL,
conﬁrming that it is the eruption source.

3.4. Correlation between the intensity of the activities

and LcP IL and S

We further inspect the properties of all active PILs
and their correlation to the intensity of the activities.
Speciﬁcally, we check the correlation between GOES 1-
8 ˚A peak ﬂux (F) and the mean length (LcP IL) and
mean shear angle (S) of the collisional PIL, which are av-
eraged in a given duration prior to the activities. Three
durations, 1 hours, 3 hours, and 5 hours are used to
do the average. The analysis is performed at various
thresholds on the two datasets to avoid the bias (see
also Section 2).

Figure 17 displays the scatter diagrams between F and
LcP IL obtained on Br series. It is seen that in general,
the LcP IL of the collisional parts of the PILs detected
at lower threshold are longer than the ones detected at
higher threshold. The values calculated from 100 G and
125 G are close, with the former being around 4 Mm
longer than the latter. The ones calculated from 150 G
are around 7 Mm shorter than the ones from 125 G, but
are close (around 2 Mm higher) to the ones from 175 G.
For a ﬁxed threshold, the LcP IL computed over diﬀer-
ent durations shows no signiﬁcant diﬀerence, although
the value slightly decreases as the duration increases.
Overall, there is a relatively nontrivial correlation be-
tween the magnitude of the ﬂares and the length of the
collisional parts of the PILs, being established for all
thresholds and durations. The Pearson correlation co-
eﬃcients are not small, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 with
the conﬁdence levels all greater than 99%. This indi-
cates that intenser activities tend to originate from the
longer collisional PILs.

We choose the values calculated at the threshold of
100 G and duration of 3 hours for interpretation (Fig-
ure 17(b)). A linear ﬁtting to the scatter plot gives a
relation of Log(F ) = 0.013×LcP IL−5.63 (the black solid
line). The LcP IL of diﬀerent ARs are rather scattered.
The collisional parts of the 2 conjoined sPIL/ePIL are
the shortest, measured as 4.3 Mm and 11.7 Mm. Those
of the 6 conjoined sPIL/cPIL are overall larger, ranging

from 20.0 Mm to 61.0 Mm. The LcP IL of the 11 cPILs
are relatively largest, ranging from 12.9 Mm to 87.5 Mm.
In general, the average of all LcP IL is 41.8 Mm (the ver-
tical dashed line in Figure 17(b)), and 68% (13/19) of
the LcP IL fall in the range of 18 Mm to 65.6 Mm (the
shaded region in Figure 17(b)), which are one standard
deviation (σ) below and over the average. Considering
that F is positively correlated to LcP IL, taking the av-
eraged lower cutoﬀ value for LcP IL (18 Mm here) as a
reference value may be useful to assess the signiﬁcance
of the collision, thus to evaluate the productivity of the
AR. It is seen that except the two conjoined sPIL/ePIL
and one cPIL in AR 12089, the 84% (16/19) of the LcP IL
are above the reference value.

Note that all of the activities occur within the region
of Θ ≤ 60◦ (see Table 1), with 9 cases close to the disk
center (having Θ ≤ 30◦, marked by “+” symbol in circle
in Figure 17). As discussed in Section 2, the criterion of
Θ ≤ 60◦ could ensure relatively high signal-to-noise ra-
tio of the data, but is still less strict than Θ ≤ 30◦ since
either dateset suﬀer from the least uncertainties near the
center. We thus further perform a correlation analysis
on the 9 near center cases particularly (shown in olive
color in Figure 17). It is seen that there is still relatively
nontrivial correlation between F and LcP IL. The corre-
lation coeﬃcients range from 0.62 to 0.85, being very
close to the ones obtained from the full sample at the
thresholds of 100 G and 150 G, and slightly higher at
the thresholds of 125 G and 175 G. The conﬁdence lev-
els of the correlations are lower than the ones from the
full sample, ranging from 92.3% to 99.6%, which may
be resulted from the smaller sample size of 9 cases. In a
word, the trend that intenser activities tend to originate
from the PILs with longer collision still exists when only
considering the cases having lower noise data.

One may also question that the relatively nontrivial
correlations may be largely determined by the two con-
joined sPIL/ePIL cases, since they have the shortest
LcP IL as well as the smallest ﬂare.
In order to check
this possibility, we further analyze the correlation on a
sample excluding the two cases (shown in purple color
in Figure 17). It is seen that the Pearson correlation co-
eﬃcients are smaller than the ones from the full sample,
decreasing by around 0.1, but are still relatively non-
trivial, ranging from 0.5 to 0.67. The decrease of the
coeﬃcients suggests that the two sPIL/ePIL cases do
bias the correlation. Moreover, since there are only two
sPIL/ePIL cases, we are not able to make precise con-
clusion about how much this kind of case can aﬀect the
correlation. We can only see that the correlation coeﬃ-
cients are not small even after excluding the two cases,
still indicating the trend that intenser activities tend to
originate from PILs with longer collisional length.

The LcP IL obtained on Blos dataset show the similar
distribution (Figure 18). In general, LcP IL decreases as
the detection threshold increases, with about 7 Mm per
25 G averagely. For a ﬁxed threshold, the LcP IL calcu-

lated from higher durations are slightly lower. Taking
the values obtained at the threshold of 100 G and dura-
tion of 3 hours as an example (Figure 18(h)), the mean
value of the LcP IL is 42.8 Mm. The 84% (16/19) of the
LcP IL are longer than 18.8 Mm (1 σ below the average)
excepting the two conjoined sPIL/ePIL and a cPIL in
AR 12089. The two lower cutoﬀ values obtained on both
Br and Blos datasets are quite close, we thus take 18 Mm
as a reference value when assessing the intensity of the
collision. Relatively nontrivial correlation still exists be-
tween F and LcP IL for all thresholds and durations on
Blos. The correlation coeﬃcients range from 0.56 to
0.82 with a conﬁdence level higher than 98%. When
only considering the 9 cases near the disk center, there
is also relatively nontrivial correlation. The correlation
coeﬃcients are slightly lower than on the full sample
at the smaller threshold (50 G to 100 G), and slightly
higher at the larger threshold (125 G to 175 G), ranging
from 0.51 to 0.91. The conﬁdence levels are lower, rang-
ing from 83.8% to 99.9%, which may be because that
the sample size of 9 cases is smaller. When excluding
the two sPIL/ePIL cases, the correlation coeﬃcients also
decrease (by around 0.02 to 0.1), but are still nontriv-
ial, ranging from 0.54 to 0.77. This also indicates that
the two sPIL/ePIL cases do bias the correlation, but do
not seem to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the trend indicated by
the correlation that intenser activities tend to originate
from PILs with longer collisional length.

Overall, the results obtained at larger thresholds
(≥100 G, Figure 18(g)-(r)) on Blos correlate well with
those from Br dataset. For the ones obtained from lower
thresholds (50 G and 75 G, Figure 18(a)-(f)), the cor-
relation, with coeﬃcients ranging from 0.56 to 0.71, be-
comes weaker but is still non-ignorable. The other diﬀer-
ence is that the LcP IL of one conjoined sPIL/ePIL from
AR 11422 becomes signiﬁcantly larger, e.g., increasing
from 10.0 Mm to 48.0 Mm when the threshold changes
from 100 G to 50 G at an averaging duration of 3 hours
(see also in Section 3.3). The increase of the LcP IL again
indicates that lower threshold may be more appropriate
for the sPIL/ePIL cases when detecting their collision.
The correlation obtained on Blos dataset also supports
that there is a trend that intenser activities tend to orig-
inate from the PILs with longer collisional length.

The correlations between F and the mean shear angle
S calculated from both datasets at all thresholds and
durations show no essential diﬀerence. We thus show
the scatter diagram between F and S detected at 100 G
and averaged over 3 hours in Figure 19. For the Br
dataset, the average of S is around 62◦. About 78.9% of
S fall into the range of 50.8◦ to 72.7◦ (1σ below and over
the average). Taking the lower cutoﬀ value (50◦, around
1 σ below the average) as a reference, it is found that
except one conjoined sPIL/cPIL in NOAA AR 11762,
the S of which is 36.1◦, the rest of the PILs all have S
very close to or larger than that. For the Blos dataset,
the mean S is around 57◦, close to the one from Br.

9

However, the lower cutoﬀ value (around 43◦) is lower.
This may be because that S for Blos is also calculated
using the vector ﬁeld but on the collisional PIL part
detected on Blos series, which may slightly deviate from
the PIL detected on Br. Except the one S of AR 11899,
which is 32◦, the rest are all very near to or signiﬁcantly
larger than the lower cutoﬀ value. The result suggests
that signiﬁcant shear has been built up at the collisional
parts of almost all active PILs prior to the eruptions.
The ﬂares magnitude exhibits no correlation to S. We
also ﬁnd no clear correlation between the CME velocities
and LcP IL and S, so that the results are not shown here.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this work, through tracking 19 ARs from the be-
ginning of their emergence until they produce the ﬁrst
major activities, we investigate the formation and prop-
erties of the active PILs, i.e., the source PILs of the
eruptions. We ﬁnd that none of the active PILs is sim-
ply formed by a individual bipole. On the contrast, all
of them contain non-self PIL parts. We further ﬁnd that
the PILs can be classiﬁed into three types, including 11
cPILs formed due to collision between diﬀerent bipoles,
6 conjoined sPIL/cPIL which contain the self PIL parts
and collisional PIL parts, and 2 conjoined sPIL/ePIL
which are composed of the self PIL parts and external
PIL parts. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the ﬂares magnitude
is positively correlated with the length of the collisional
parts of the active PILs, which holds on both Br and
Blos datasets at all thresholds and averaging durations
we investigated.

For the 11 cPILs, collision between nonconjugated
opposite-sign polarities develops at all of the PILs prior
to the ﬁrst major activities of the ARs. Observations
reveal that the collision accompanied by shearing and
ﬂux cancellation is driven by the self-separation of dif-
ferent bipoles when they emerge, consistent well with the
“collisional shearing” scenario proposed by Chintzoglou
et al. (2019). The length of the collisional parts clearly
show a trend of increase from the emergence start to the
activity onset, while the non-potential shear angles also
show a trend of increase although not that dramatic, fur-
ther supporting the ongoing collisional shearing. Taking
the collisional lengths detected on Br series at 100 G and
averaged in 3 hours (prior to the ﬂare) as the example,
10 of them are longer than the reference value of signif-
icant collision (18 Mm).

For the 6 conjoined sPIL/cPIL, collision also develops
and grows at part of the PILs prior to the activities,
with shearing and ﬂux cancellation observed. All of the
averaged collisional lengths are longer than 18 Mm. In
the ARs containing this type of PILs, collision may not
only occur between nonconjugated opposite-sign polari-
ties, but also occur between same-sign polarities of dif-
ferent bipoles. This kind of collision may further shear
the ﬁeld lines through moving the footpoints of the ﬁeld
lines. For example, in the sPIL/cPIL case of AR 11776,

10

the negative polarity NA pushes another negative po-
larity NB to the west, which makes NB deviate from its
original northward direction, and apparently can shear
the ﬁeld lines connecting NB and PB. This indeed also
is a kind of photospheric motions (see also in Section 1)
driven by the collision.

For the 2 conjoined sPIL/ePIL, collision signatures
are also observed. The collisional length is short at the
threshold of 100 G. Considering that the magnetic ﬁeld
of the two ARs is not as strong as others, it might be
more appropriate to use lower thresholds (e.g., 50 G)
on low noise Blos when detecting their collision. When
lowering the threshold to 50 G, the collision length of
AR 11422 becomes signiﬁcantly longer until the ﬂare.
That of AR 11870 evolves dramatically, being longer
at the early emergence phase and shorter near to the
ﬂare. As there are only two sPIL/ePIL cases, we can-
not draw general conclusion on the collision feature of
this type of PILs. We have strictly followed the criteria
(see Section 2) when selecting the cases from the list of
423 emerging ARs in Kutsenko et al. (2019). As also
mentioned in Chintzoglou et al. (2019), the criteria of
“emerging and producing major eruptions on the visi-
ble disk” are strict thus have screened out most of the
cases. The few sPIL/ePIL cases here is more likely to
be an indicator of how often such cases occur.

Overall, at all active PILs we studied, collisional signa-
tures are found developing prior to the ﬁrst major activ-
ities of the ARs, with 16 of them having averaged colli-
sional length longer than 18 Mm. Here we deﬁne 18 Mm
(detected at 100 G) as a reference value when assess-
ing the signiﬁcance of the collision, while that in Chint-
zoglou et al. (2019) is deﬁned as 40 Mm. Nevertheless,
the latter is obtained based on two large, productive
ARs, whilst 18 Mm here is calculated as 1 σ below the
averaged collisional length of all active PILs, which are
got from 19 ARs owning various sizes. Thus the two
values may not be conﬂicting, and the value of 18 Mm
may be more general.

Note that 18 Mm is just a reference from a statistical
perspective. For the three cases owning LcP IL shorter
than 18 Mm, the small collision at the cPIL one in AR
12089 is more likely resulted from the small size of the
AR (around 1.2 × 1021 Mx) since the ﬁrst major activity
occurs only 4 hours after the emergence onset. The col-
lision is relatively signiﬁcant for the small AR, playing
an important role in driving the eruption. For the con-
joined sPIL/ePIL one in AR 11422, the collision before
the ﬂare, which also mainly occurs between the noncon-
jugated polarities, increases to as long as 48 Mm when
lower the detection threshold to 50 G, indicating that
the collision is rather signiﬁcant. For the other one, i.e.,
the conjoined sPIL/ePIL in AR 11870, the collisional
length before the ﬂare is short (below 10 Mm) even at

the lower threshold, but is rather signiﬁcant (with LcP IL
as high as 60 Mm) in the early emergence phase. Diﬀer-
ent from the other ARs, quite a part of the early colli-
sion in AR 11870 occurs between the conjugated polari-
ties (e.g., Figure 15(b)), which may be resulted from the
small moving dipoles (the conjugated polarities of which
are very close) during the emergence. The early colli-
sion may have transferred the emerging ﬁeld higher into
the corona, which may interact with other higher, pre-
existing magnetic ﬁeld, playing a role in producing the
eruptions. A similar scenario is discussed in Schmieder
et al. (2014, and references therein).

The positive correlation between the ﬂares magnitude
and the length of the collisional parts of the PILs sug-
gests that the intenser activities tend to originate from
the longer collisional PILs, further suggesting that the
collision plays the important role in generating the large
activities. Considering that the ﬁeld at almost all colli-
sional PILs is signiﬁcantly sheared before the eruptions,
the longer collisional PILs indicate that more sheared
magnetic ﬂux is involved into the cancellation, thus a
larger amount of magnetic free energy may be available
to consume during the eruptions.

As the ﬂares and CMEs are suggested to be closely
related to the eruptions of the magnetic ﬂux ropes (e.g.,
Shibata et al. 1995), their source locations may give hint
to the origin of the coronal ﬂux ropes. For the two
generally accepted scenarios of coronal ﬂux rope forma-
tion (Cheng et al. 2017, and reference therein), the bod-
ily emergence from the solar interior should produce a
bipolar region on the photosphere (e.g., Fan & Gibson
2004), while formation in the solar atmosphere usually
doesn’t support simple bipole conﬁguration. In the two
productive ARs in Chintzoglou et al. (2019), none of the
eruptions originated from the self PIL of a single bipole.
The authors thus suggested that no ﬂux rope formed or
emerged above the sPIL, and the bodily emergence of
the ﬂux rope may be rare. In our sample, lack of the ac-
tivities originated from the single sPIL also supports this
point. It is also consistent with other reported observa-
tions, in which the ﬁlament (a proxy of the ﬂux rope)
formed above the self PIL is found to be rare (Mackay
et al. 2008).

To summarize, in all of the emerging ARs we studied,
the collision develops at the active PILs prior to the ﬁrst
major activities from the ARs, and in at least 84% (16 of
19) of them, the collisional shearing is quite signiﬁcant.
Furthermore, the magnitude of the ﬂares is positively
correlated with the length of the collisional parts of the
PILs. From the statistical perspective, the results con-
solidate that the bipole-bipole interactions during the
ﬂux emergence play the important role in driving the
major solar activities. Moreover, the length of the colli-
sional PIL may be a promising indicator in forecasting
the major solar activities.

Figure 1. Evolution of NOAA AR 11162. (a)-(f) Evolution of the photospheric Br. White (black) patches are the positive
(negative) polarities, saturating at ±2000 Gauss. PA and NA indicate the positive and negative polarities of bipole A, while
PB and NB are for bipole B. The cyan lines mark the source PIL of the ﬁrst major activity, which are obtained by the direct
contours at Br = 0. The red lines indicate the collisional components of the PILs. The collisional parts are obtained by the
method described in Section 2. The yellow circles mark the ﬂux-weighted centroids of the polarities, with those of the conjugated
polarities connected by the yellow lines. The magenta circles in panels (d) and (e) mark the location where a patch of negative
polarity disappears. An animation of the magnetograms lasting from 2011-02-17T14:10 to 2011-02-18T12:58 is available online.
(g) The trajectories of the ﬂux-weighted centroids of all polarities tracked on Br dataset. As time elapses, the color of the dots
changes from blue to red. (h) Evolution of the distances between each pair of conjugated polarities and between the colliding,
nonconjugated polarities. (i) Evolution of the magnetic ﬂux (Φ), the length (LcP IL) and mean shear angle (S) of the collisional
part of the PIL obtained on both Br and radialized Blos datasets at the threshold of 100 G. Errors for the LcP IL from Br are
further shown, accounting for 15% of the values of LcP IL. The percentage is estimated by Chintzoglou et al. (2019) using the
same cPIL detection method. The errors for S are the standard deviations of the shear angles of the collisional parts of the
PILs. Vertical lines in (h) and (i) mark the onset instant of the ﬂare. The locations at the top of panel (i) are disk-centered
angles of the AR at the relevant timings.

Figure 13. The evolution of NOAA AR 11422. Similar layout as Figure 1. NE denotes the external negative polarity. The
collisional PIL part detected at the threshold of 50 G on Blos dataset is overplotted on the Br magnetograms for comparison
(in purple color). Its LcP IL and S is also shown in panel (i). There is slight inconsistency between the spatial locations of the
purple line and the cyan line (or red line), which may result from the diﬀerence between the corrected Blos and the Br. An
animation of the magnetograms lasting from 2012-02-18T09:58 to 2012-02-19T11:22 is available online.

Figure 17. The scatter plots of the mean length of the collisional part of the PIL (LcP IL) obtained from Br dataset on
various thresholds and averaging durations vs. the GOES 1-8 ˚A ﬂux (F). For each AR, LcP IL is averaged in the given durations
prior to its ﬁrst major activity. The term “Thre” indicates the threshold of the cPIL detection. “Dur” indicates the duration
prior to the activities within which to do the average. The red circles show the parameters of the cPILs. The green ones are for
the conjoined sPIL/cPIL and the blue ones are for the conjoined sPIL/ePIL, respective. The cases having Θ ≤ 30◦ are further
marked by the “+” sign in circles. The black solid lines show the result of a linear ﬁtting between LcP IL and the logarithmic
GOES ﬂux for all cases, with the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient CC and corresponding conﬁdence level, and the slope k shown
at the bottom right. The purple dash-dotted lines show the linear ﬁtting results on the sample excluding the two conjoined
sPIL/ePIL cases. The olive dash-dotted lines show the linear ﬁtting results on the cases with Θ ≤ 30◦. The vertical dashed line
in (a) indicates the average of all LcP IL, with shaded region covering between one standard deviation (of all LcP IL) below and
over the average. The value of the average and the range of the shaded region are shown at the upper axis. The vertical dashed
lines and the shaded regions in the other panels have the same meaning.

Figure 19. The scatter plots of the mean shear angle (S) vs. the GOES 1-8 ˚A ﬂux. The S of each AR is averaged in three
hours prior to the ﬁrst major activity based on the collisional PIL part detected at the threshold of 100 G on Br dataset in
panel (a), and at 100 G on Blos dataset in panel (b). The vertical lines, shaded regions and labels have similar meaning as the
ones in Figure 17.
