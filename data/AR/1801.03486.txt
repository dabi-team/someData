ABSTRACT

The evolution of photospheric ﬂow and magnetic ﬁelds before and after ﬂares can
provide important information regarding the ﬂare triggering and back reaction pro-
cesses. However, such studies on the ﬂow ﬁeld are rare due to the paucity of high-
resolution observations covering the entire ﬂaring period. Here we study the structural
evolution of penumbra and shear ﬂows associated with the 2015 June 22 M6.5 ﬂare in
NOAA AR 12371, using high-resolution imaging observation in the TiO band taken
by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory, with the aid of
the diﬀerential aﬃne velocity estimator method for ﬂow tracking. The accompanied
photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld changes are also analyzed using data from the He-
lioseismic and Magnetic Imager. As a result, we found, for a penumbral segment in
the negative ﬁeld adjacent to the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), an enhance-
ment of penumbral ﬂows (up to an unusually high value of ∼2 km s−1) and extension
of penumbral ﬁbrils after the ﬁrst peak of the ﬂare hard X-ray (HXR) emission. We
also found an area at the PIL, which is co-spatial with a precursor brightening kernel,
exhibits a gradual increase of shear ﬂow velocity (up to ∼0.9 km s−1) after the ﬂare.
The enhancing penumbral and shear ﬂow regions are also accompanied by an increase
of horizontal ﬁeld and decrease of magnetic inclination angle(measured from the solar
surface). These results are discussed in the context of the theory of back reaction of
coronal restructuring on the photosphere as a result of ﬂare energy release.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is generally believed that solar ﬂares are powered by free magnetic energy stored
in the corona (Priest & Forbes 2002), and that the energy released via magnetic re-
connection causes plasma heating and particle acceleration (Shibata & Magara 2011),
producing various ﬂaring signatures at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. Al-
though tremendous eﬀorts have been devoted to ﬂare studies, many fundamental
physical problems are still not well understood, such as the energy build-up and
triggering of ﬂares, and the consequent back reaction into the low atmosphere as
a result of the sudden coronal restructuring (see Wang & Liu 2015, for a review).
Since coronal magnetic ﬁelds are anchored to the dense photosphere, insights into
these problems can be obtained by studying the structural evolution of photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld and the closely coupled plasma ﬂow ﬁeld leading to and from ﬂare
events. In general, the ﬁrst problem above is often related to relatively long-term (in
hours to days) evolution of magnetic and ﬂow ﬁelds (e.g., emerging ﬂuxes, shear and
converging ﬂows), while the second problem above deals with short-term (in tens of
minutes) ﬂare-induced changes of magnetic/ﬂow ﬁelds down to the photosphere of
solar eruption.

It is particularly noticeable that back reaction is traditionally considered to be small
because of the large inertia of the photosphere. The reconﬁguration of coronal ﬁeld is
the focus of almost all models of ﬂares and the often associated coronal mass ejections
(CMEs), which generally do not consider the restructuring of magnetic and ﬂow ﬁelds
in the photosphere due to the assumed line-tying eﬀect. Based on the principles of
energy and momentum conservation, Hudson et al. (2008) and Fisher et al. (2012)
quantitatively investigated the back reaction on the solar surface and interior as a
result of the coronal ﬁeld evolution (speciﬁcally, implosion) after energy release, and
pointed out that ﬂares/CMEs would make the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld become
more horizontal at the ﬂare-related magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs). The
authors formulated the resulted changes of the integrated vertical (downward) and
horizontal Lorentz force exerted on the photosphere from the corona, and suggested
that the former may energize seismic waves and the latter may cause plasma bulk mo-
tions. Thus far, these predictions of the back reaction theory have been substantiated
by many aspects of observational results of ﬂare-related photospheric magnetic/ﬂow
ﬁeld changes, including the rapid and permanent step-like increase of horizontal ﬁeld
at ﬂaring PILs (e.g., Wang 1992; Liu et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2009; Wang & Liu 2010;
Liu et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2012; Petrie 2012; Sun et al. 2017), possible linkage to
the excitation of seismic waves (e.g., Alvarado-Gómez et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014),
and sunspot displacement and rotations (e.g., Anwar et al. 1993; Wang et al. 2014;
Liu et al. 2016). The downward collapse of coronal current systems presumably due
to coronal implosion following ﬂares/CMEs is also corroborated by time sequence of
nonlinear force-free ﬁeld models (e.g., Sun et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014) and is reﬂected
in MHD simulations (e.g., Fan 2005, 2010).

Besides magnetic ﬁeld variations, changes of sunspot structure in white light have
also been found to be consistent with the back reaction scenario. Notably, sunspot
penumbrae are a direct indication of horizontal photospheric ﬁeld, with their ﬁbrils
following the direction of magnetic azimuth (Solanki 2003). The outward plasma
ﬂows along ﬁbrils (known as Evershed ﬂows) can have a velocity up to ∼4 km s−1 in
photosphere from spectroscopic observations (e.g., Solanki et al. 1994), and can reach
up to ∼8 km s−1 in chromosphere (Balthasar et al. 2014), while optical penumbral
ﬂows measured by ﬂow tracking methods based on imaging observations generally
result in a velocity on the order of ∼1 km s−1 (e.g., Tan et al. 2009; Verma & Denker
2012). The penumbral structure and its carried ﬂows are governed by the magnetic
ﬁeld strength and especially the ﬁeld inclination, as revealed by previous observa-
tions (e.g., Ichimoto 2010; Deng et al. 2011) and MHD simulations (Rempel et al.
2009; Kitiashvili et al. 2009). Thus, the expected more horizontal photospheric ﬁeld
conﬁguration in response to the coronal restructuring as described above is strongly
evidenced by observations of ﬂare-related darkening and/or formation of penumbral
structure, together with strengthened horizontal ﬁeld and decreased inclination an-
gle, near central ﬂaring PILs (Liu et al. 2005; Deng et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2007;
Li et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2016). It can be noted that these papers
studied the structural evolution of penumbra mainly based on the overall intensity
of penumbral segments, without examining in detail the associated penumbral ﬂows.
Understandably, studying the ﬂare-related ﬂow ﬁeld evolution requires high-quality,
high-resolution observations that cover the entire ﬂare interval, which are, however,
relatively rarely available. Using high-resolution (0.′′2) G-band images from Hinode,
Tan et al. (2009) observed enhancement of the central penumbral region of the δ spot
in NOAA AR 10930 associated with the December 13 X3.4 ﬂare. By employing the
local correlation tracking (LCT) technique, the authors were able to detect shear ﬂows
(i.e., opposite-directed ﬂows at the two sides of the PIL) in the penumbral region,
which exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease associated with the ﬂare, probably due to the
magnetic restructuring and energy release. Importantly, shear ﬂows can contribute to
the build up of magnetic nonpotentiality in ﬂaring regions (Harvey & Harvey 1976;
Amari et al. 2000; Welsch et al. 2009) and thus ﬂare triggering, as in high resolu-
tion they show a close spatial proximity to the initial ﬂare kernels (Yang et al. 2004;
Deng et al. 2006). It is obvious that more studies of both the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld
evolution in penumbrae can help to shed further light on our understanding of the
photosphere-corona coupling related to ﬂaring activities.

In this paper, we take advantage of the unprecedented resolution of the recently
commissioned 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (NST; Goode et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2010;
Goode & Cao 2012; Varsik et al. 2014) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to
investigate the photospheric ﬂow ﬁeld associated with the 2015 June 22 M6.5 ﬂare,
and also study the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld using data from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory

(SDO). We concentrate on the structural evolution of penumbra near the ﬂaring PIL,
and make quantitative characterizations of the ﬂare-related changes of the ﬂow and
magnetic properties. We compare our results with previous studies and discuss their
implications in the context of the back reaction theory. The structure of this paper
is as follows. We introduce the observations and data analysis methods in Section 2,
and describe the observational results in Section 3. Major ﬁndings are summarized
and discussed in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING

With excellent seeing condition, BBSO/GST achieved diﬀraction-limited imaging
on 2015 June 22 during ∼16:25–22:50 UT, thanks to the high-order AO-308 system
(with 308 sub-apertures) and speckle image reconstruction. The obtained multiwave-
length observations have revealed many interesting properties of the fully covered
M6.5 ﬂare, including ﬂare precursors, sunspot rotation, and various ﬁne structures
(Wang et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2016; Jing et al. 2016). The essential data used in this
study for tracking the photospheric ﬂows are the images taken by the GST’s Broad-
Band Filter Imager at the TiO band (7057 Å, 10 Å bandpass), a proxy for the contin-
uum photosphere, using a 2048 × 2048 pixels CCD camera with a ∼70′′ ﬁeld of view
(FOV). The spatial resolution (at diﬀraction limit θ = λ/D) of TiO images is 0.′′09,
and the temporal cadence is 15 s. As for magnetic ﬁeld, we used 135 second cadence
vector magnetograms from HMI’s full-disk vector ﬁeld data product (Hoeksema et al.
2014; Sun et al. 2017), which is provided by the Joint Science Operations Center. The
pixel scale of HMI data is 0.′′5. The TiO images and magnetograms are aligned based
on sunspot and plage features, with an alignment accuracy within ∼0.′′3, which is
the best accuracy by using interpolation. Also used are the 25–50 keV hard X-ray
(HXR) time proﬁle from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM; Meegan et al.
2009) for studying the timing of ﬂare energy release, and 1700 Å continuum (5000 K)
images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board
SDO for disclosing the ﬂare precursor brightenings in the low atmosphere.

To derive the ﬂow ﬁeld on photosphere based on the TiO observation, we aligned
TiO images to sub-pixel precision, normalized the intensity to that of a quiet-Sun area,
and applied a 2 × 2 image binning to increase the S/N ratio; we then applied the
diﬀerential aﬃne velocity estimator (DAVE; Schuck 2006), which is a demonstrated
technique for ﬂow detection and tracking. Here we set the tracking window to 25
pixels, trying to include enough structure information and at the mean time achieving
a good resolution. We estimate quantitative uncertainty by analyzing data with
tracking window range from 20 to 30 pixels, which results in a maximum relative
standard deviation (RSD) as 5%. For a validity check, we repeated the ﬂow tracking
using the LCT method (November & Simon 1988), which produced similar results.

oscillation, a ﬁve minute running average was further made to the derived DAVE
velocity vectors.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

The ﬂare-productive NOAA AR 12731 appears in the βγδ conﬁguration on 2015
June 22. The M6.5 ﬂare of interest occurred in this region starts at 17:39 UT in
GOES 1–8 Å soft X-ray ﬂux, and shows three main peaks in Fermi 25–50 keV HXR
ﬂux at 17:52:31, 17:58:37, and 18:12:25 UT (Liu et al. 2016). The separating two
ribbons of the ﬂare originate from penumbral regions very close to the PIL, and
subsequently sweep across the main sunspot umbrae of opposite magnetic polarity
(Wang et al. 2017; Jing et al. 2016). In this work we focus on the evolution of the
central penumbral region of this δ conﬁguration from the pre- to post-ﬂare states.
Dynamic details can be seen in the accompanying TiO animation in the online journal.
Similar to previous studies, stepwise changes of physical properties are observed and
are quantiﬁed by ﬁtting to a step function (Sudol & Harvey 2005)

tan−1[n(t − t0)]} ,

where a and b describe the strength and evolution of the background, t is time, c
represents half amplitude of the step, n controls the slope of the step, and t0 is the
middle point of the step.
In this equation the time of the start of the change is
t0 − 0.5πn−1.

3.1. Evolution of Growing Penumbra Region

By observing the time-lapse TiO movie, one can easily identify the most prominent
ﬂare-related penumbral evolution, that is, one segment of the central penumbra lying
in the negative ﬁeld becomes much enhanced (in terms of ﬂow dynamics) and extends
to the north, with a close temporal relationship with the ﬂare. This can be readily
seen by comparing the pre- (17:34 UT) and post-ﬂare (19:22 UT) TiO images as shown
in Figures 1(a) and (b), respectively. The diﬀerence image in Figure 1(c) (post-ﬂare
minus pre-ﬂare state) displays a main darkened region R (encompassed by the red
contour), which corresponds to the newly formed portion of the penumbra that was
occupied by photospheric granulations. In Figure 2, we show the maps of ﬂow vectors
and azimuth derived with DAVE in the pre- and post-ﬂare states. It is evident that
after the ﬂare, the ﬂow vectors strengthen vastly, not only in the northern newly
formed penumbral region R but also in the previously existing, common penumbral
area; moreover, the azimuth of ﬂows become more uniform, predominantly toward
the north direction. An accompanying gradual increase of penumbral ﬂow speed is
shown in time-lapse ﬂow movie. A similar overall enhancement of horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld across the existing and newly formed penumbra regions is also observed (cf.
Figures 1(d) and (e)).

To better depict the temporal evolution of the penumbral structure, in Figure 3(a)
we construct the space-time slice image for a slit (marked as the red line in Fig-

ﬁrst HXR peak (∼17:52 UT), with its northern end of ﬁbrils extending for a distance
of 2.′′6(±.′′3) in about 20 minutes (from which we found that the north end of ﬁbrils
extends at an average speed of 1.5(±0.05) km s−1); later on, it continues to slowly ex-
tend northward for about two hours (at an average speed of 0.17(±0.01) km s−1). We

Figure 3. Space-time slice image based on BBSO/GST TiO intensity images (a) and the
derived time sequence of DAVE velocity ﬁeld (b). The slit is marked as the red vertical
line in Figures 1(a)–(c). The vertical dashed line denotes the time of the ﬁrst HXR peak at
17:52:31 UT, the horizontal solid line denotes intersections of slit with region R in Figure 2(a)
(b). The overplotted red lines in (a) trace several prominent evolving penumbral ﬁbril
features, and are used to estimate the ﬂow velocity based on their slope.

also trace several prominent evolving ﬁbril features of the main penumbral body using
red lines in Figure 3(a), which exhibit that after the ﬁrst HXR peak, the penumbral
ﬂows become more conspicuous, with a velocity reaching up to 2.3(±0.12) km s−1
(estimated based on the slope of red lines). The evolution of ﬂow velocity is also
directly manifested in Figure 3(b), which is the space-time slice image for the same
slit but built upon the time sequence of the velocity ﬁeld derived with DAVE. The
penumbral ﬂows strengthens from an average velocity of 0.8(±0.04) km s−1 at 30
minutes before the ﬁrst HXR peak to 2.2(±0.11) km s−1 at 90 minutes afterwards
within the region R edges, which is comparable with the velocity estimation using
the time slices. It is pertinent to point out that this velocity (2.2(±0.11) km s−1) of
penumbral ﬂows is about twice as large as that measured based on Hinode G-band
images (Tan et al. 2009), presumably due to (1)the higher resolution of the TiO data
used in the present analysis, and (2) intrinsic property of this speciﬁc active region
we studied.

In Figure 4, we further plot time proﬁles of mean TiO intensity, ﬂow velocity, hori-
zontal ﬁeld strength, and magnetic inclination angle (deﬁned as the angle of magnetic
ﬁeld vector with respect to solar surface) of the newly developed penumbral region
R, and compare their timings with the HXR emission. The results show that after
about the ﬁrst HXR peak, the region R begins to show an increase of penumbral ﬂow
velocity together with a penumbral darkening, an increase of horizontal magnetic ﬁeld
strength, and a decrease of ﬁeld inclination angle. Speciﬁcally, according to the step

(the elliptical region in Figure 2d). (a) TiO intensity. (b) Shear ﬂow velocity. (c) Horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld strength. (d) Magnetic inclination angle. In (c) and (d), data are ﬁt to a

By examining the time sequence of TiO ﬂow maps, we also ﬁnd pronounced shear
ﬂows along the PIL in this ﬂaring region. As can be seen in Figure 2(a), around
region P the ﬂows in the eastern side of the PIL pointing toward southwest while
those in the western side of the PIL pointing toward northeast, constituting a clear
shear ﬂow pattern.
In the azimuth map computed using the derived ﬂow vectors
(Figure 2(c)), the shear ﬂow pattern can be recognized as a green-magenta feature
with the central dividing line running along the PIL. We note that (1) this shear ﬂow
region is co-spatial with a “magnetic channel” structure (with multiple polarity inver-

sions) that can be identiﬁed using high-resolution magnetic ﬁeld observations for this
region (Wang et al. 2017), and is also adjacent to a low-atmospheric, ﬂare precursor
brightening kernel K (cf. Figures 1(f) and 2(a)(c)). Such a spatial correlation be-
tween shear ﬂows and initial ﬂare kernels was also found before using high-resolution
observations (Yang et al. 2004; Deng et al. 2006), suggesting that the shear ﬂow may
contribute to the ﬂare triggering process. (2) Most intriguingly, the shear ﬂow en-
hances and its region expands substantially after the ﬂare (cf. Figures 2(a)(c) and
(b)(d)). For a quantitative analysis, we deﬁne the magnitude of shear ﬂow velocity
as vshear = vpos − vneg, where vpos (vneg) is the ﬂow velocity in the positive (negative)
ﬁeld region, in the direction parallel to the PIL. For the results in this paper, positive
value of vshear represents counterclock-wise direction of shear. In Figure 5(b), we plot
the time proﬁle of the shear ﬂow velocity averaged over the region P (in Figure 2(d)).
A gradual increase of shear ﬂow is seen from the ﬁrst HXR peak, and later reaches
0.9(±0.05) km s−1 at 19:30 UT. This magnitude of shear ﬂows is 50(±5)% larger than
that of the maximum shear ﬂows in the event of Tan et al. (2009).

The shear ﬂow region P has an insigniﬁcant intensity variation (within 5%) asso-
ciated with the ﬂare (Figure 5(a)). Nevertheless, it still shows appreciable, stepwise
changes of magnetic properties. Fittings using a step function indicate that starting
from 17:50 UT (co-temporal with the ﬁrst HXR peak), the horizontal ﬁeld strength
increases 220(±20) G from 17:50 UT to 18:20 UT (Figure 5(c)), while the ﬁeld incli-
nation angle decreases 5(±0.5)◦ from 17:50 UT to 18:20 UT (Figure 5(d)). Compared
to the growing penumbral region R, the transition time of horizontal ﬁeld changes in
shear region P is longer and followed by a ﬂater gradual increase.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

We have presented a detailed study of the structural evolution of photospheric
ﬂow and magnetic ﬁelds associated with the 2015 June 22 M6.5 ﬂare, concentrating
on the central penumbrae of the δ region around the ﬂaring PIL. We tracked the
penumbral ﬂow ﬁeld with the DAVE method using high-resolution TiO images from
BBSO/GST, and also analyzed the associated magnetic ﬁeld using SDO/HMI vector
magnetograms. The main results are summarized as follows.

1. Beginning from the ﬁrst HXR peak, one segment of penumbra lying in the nega-
tive ﬁeld experiences a distinct grow, extending northward at 1.5(±0.05) km s−1
for a distance of 2.′′6(±.′′3); meanwhile, the ﬂow velocity within the entire penum-
bral region becomes more pronounced, gaining a 115(±10) % increase reaching
up to 2.2(±0.11) km s−1 at ∼90 minutes after ﬁrst ﬂare peak. These structure
and ﬂow ﬁeld evolutions are accompanied by a step-like increase of horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld by 150(±15) G and decrease of inclination angle by 5(±0.5)◦ in
18 minutes from 17:50 UT to 18:08 UT.

2. A region of shear ﬂow at the ﬂaring PIL is found next to the location of a
ﬂare precursor brightening, and expands signiﬁcantly after the ﬂare. From the

12

Wang et al.

ﬁrst HXR peak, the shear ﬂow velocity increases gradually by 0.4(±0.1) km s−1
from 0.5(±0.05) km s−1 at 17:30 UT to 0.9(±0.05) km s−1 at 19:30 UT. As for
magnetic ﬁeld properties in the shear ﬂow region, the horizontal ﬁeld strength
increases 220(±20) G while the inclination angle decreases 5(±0.5)◦ from 17:50
UT to 18:20 UT, both following a stepwise fashion. In comparison with the
extending penumbral segment, the transition time of step-like magnetic ﬁeld
changes in the shear ﬂow region is ∼10 minutes longer.

Our results of the strengthening of penumbral structure at the center of δ region,
the associated increase (decrease) of horizontal ﬁeld (inclination angle), and their
close timing relationship to the ﬂare energy release strongly favor the back reaction
of coronal ﬁelds as the underlying cause, which results in a more horizontal conﬁgu-
ration of photospheric ﬁeld. While most other work only deals with the ﬂare-related
overall intensity change of penumbral structure, we are able to study the evolution
of penumbral ﬂow ﬁeld owing to the high-resolution BBSO/GST data. We show
that although noticeable intensity darkening is only observed in the newly formed
penumbral portion, the strengthening of penumbra is predominantly manifested as
the enhancement of penumbral ﬂow velocity and enlargement of penumbral area. The
inconsistency of our results with the claim of darkening of central penumbral feature
in some previous studies may due to the limitation of the used low-resolution images
(e.g., Liu et al. 2005) and also the complexity of the central penumbral area near PIL
(Wang et al. 2017).

The also revealed spatial correlation between the shear ﬂow and ﬂare precursor
brightening kernel corroborates the importance of photospheric ﬂow ﬁeld in trigger-
ing ﬂares. In this event, the precursor brightenings are caused by the reconnection
between emerging ﬂuxes in the magnetic channel with ambient large-scale sheared
loops (Wang et al. 2017). The produced lower-lying ﬁelds near the PIL could be
readily subject to the downward collapse of coronal ﬁelds (Liu et al. 2012), which
may explain the observed more rapid magnetic ﬁeld changes in the shear ﬂow region.
We also remark that the change of shear ﬂows associated with ﬂares is an obser-
vational fact of particular interest but its study has been lacking. Like penumbral
enhancement, we also tend to attribute the observed increase of shear ﬂow after the
present ﬂare to the more horizontal photospheric ﬁelds due to back reaction. An
increase of shear ﬂows near the PIL was also found by Deng et al. (2006) associated
with an X10 ﬂare in NOAA AR 10486, although the shear ﬂows are not located in the
central penumbra with accompanied magnetic ﬁeld changes. To our knowledge, the
study most closely related to our work was conducted by Tan et al. (2009) on an X3.4
ﬂare in NOAA AR 10930. Contrarily, the authors saw a rapid decrease of shear ﬂow
in the central penumbral region, and explained it as a signature of magnetic energy re-
laxation between the two major magnetic polarities of the δ spot, one of which shows
a continuous rotation before the ﬂare. Such a relaxation could be viewed in line with
the ﬁnding of sudden release of magnetic shear in the horizontal direction along the

High-resolution Study of Flow and Magnetic Field Evolution 13

PIL of δ spots, as reported by Wang (2006). We speculate that the evolution of shear
ﬂows, due to their special locations along the ﬂaring PILs, could be aﬀected by both
the back reaction from the above corona and the response of photospheric magnetic
polarities to the energy release. The back reaction creates sheared ﬂux system near
the surface (Wang et al. 1994) that may be reﬂected as increased shear ﬂow, while
relaxation of large scale system may reduce shear ﬂow.

In summary, high-resolution observations of photospheric ﬂow ﬁeld evolution from
pre- to post-ﬂare stages, together with the analysis of magnetic ﬁeld changes, will
be valuable in advancing our understanding of ﬂare triggering and back reaction
processes. Further studies in this direction are highly desired and would certainly
contribute to the science preparation in high-resolution ﬂare studies for the upcoming
4 m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope.
