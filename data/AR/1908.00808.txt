We present accurate optical spectra of semiconductors and insulators within a pure Kohn-Sham
time-dependent density-functional approach. In particular, we show that the onset of the absorption
is well reproduced when comparing to experiment. No empirical information nor a theory beyond
Kohn-Sham density-functional theory, such as GW , is invoked to correct the Kohn-Sham gap.
Our approach relies on the link between the exchange-correlation kernel of time-dependent density
functional theory and the derivative discontinuity of ground-state density-functional theory. We
show explicitly how to relate these two quantities. We illustrate the accuracy and simplicity of our
approach by applying it to various semiconductors (Si, GaP, GaAs) and wide-gap insulators (C,
LiF, Ar).

Time-dependent-density

theory
(TDDFT) [1] has become, over the years, one of
the few well-established ﬁrst-principles’ approaches to
describe time-dependent phenomena for a large variety
of systems, both in the linear-response regime and
beyond (see, e.g., Refs [2, 3] and references therein).
In the last two decades TDDFT has been increasingly
applied to solids, and in particular to the calculation of
the optical absorption spectra. Optical experiments in
general are very useful tools to investigate and charac-
terize condensed-matter systems; it is hence desirable to
develop eﬃcient and reliable theoretical approaches to
complement experiment.

Within TDDFT the description of optical spectra de-
pends crucially on the exchange-correlation (xc) kernel
fxc which relates the response of the Kohn-Sham system
to a small perturbation to the response of the true sys-
tem. Thanks to the numerical eﬃciency of TDDFT, it is
desirable that a simple but accurate xc kernel is available
for the calculation of optical spectra.
It is well-known
that traditional xc kernels, such as the random-phase
approximation (RPA), i.e., fxc = 0, and the adiabatic
local-density approximation (ALDA) [4], fail to describe
two important features of optical spectra: 1) excitonic
eﬀects and 2) the absorption onset. While excitonic ef-
fects can nowadays be described accurately for various
systems with a several xc kernels [5–10], the correct de-
scription of the absorption onset within TDDFT remains
an unsolved problem.

The starting point for a TDDFT calculation is the
Kohn-Sham band structure. As is well known, the Kohn-
in general, estimated to be much
Sham band gap is,
smaller than the fundamental gap,
i.e., the diﬀerence
between the ionization potential and the electron aﬃn-
ity. [11–13]. Therefore, since TDDFT should give the
exact absorption spectra, the TDDFT xc kernel has the
diﬃcult task to ensure that there is no absorption below
the optical gap even though transitions between Kohn-

Sham valence and conduction bands are available.
In-
deed, optical spectra obtained with all currently avail-
able xc kernels show absorption at energies close to the
Kohn-Sham band gap, thereby severely underestimating
the absorption onset.

The standard approach to circumvent this problem is
to add a scissors operator [14] to the Kohn-Sham Hamil-
tonian. The shift parameter is either obtained from ex-
periment or from a method that goes beyond KS-DFT,
such as GW [15–19], or generalised KS-DFT with a
hybrid functional, such as those based on a screened
Coulomb interaction [20–23]. The former approach is
unsatisfactory because it is empirical while the latter ap-
proach is unsatisfactory both conceptually and numeri-
cally because i) one has to go to a theory outside of the
KS-DFT framework, i.e., GW (or a hybrid functional),
in order to obtain spectra that are comparable with those
observed in experiment, and ii) a GW (or a hybrid func-
tional) calculation is much more expensive than a pure
KS-DFT calculation. Eliminating the intermediate GW
step yields a fully coherent theory. Moreover, it leads to a
large speed up of calculations, making the optical spectra
of larger systems accessible. We note that one could use
an ad hoc meta-GGA functional speciﬁcally constructed
to obtain a KS gap similar to the fundamental gap. How-
ever, this is not in agreement with fundamental DFT the-
ory because the KS gap is not equal to the fundamental
gap, the diﬀerence between the two being the derivative
discontinuity.

The TDDFT xc kernel fxc can be written exactly as

where χKS and χ0 =

dependent quasiparticle polarizability, respectively, and
G(1, 2) and Σ(1, 2) are the one-body Green function
and the self-energy, respectively. The collective index
(1) = (x, t) = (r, s, t) contains the space, spin and time
coordinates. The xc kernel written in Eq. (1) clearly ex-
hibits two distinct parts. The ﬁrst part f (1)

only involves independent (quasi-)particles, and, there-
fore, is responsible for the shift of the Kohn-Sham band
gap to the fundamental gap, while the second part, f (2)
xc ,
which includes the electron-hole interaction, accounts for
the excitonic eﬀects. In general, both terms are required
to guarantee a correct onset of the absorption, unless
the exciton binding energy is small, in which case f (1)
xc
is suﬃcient. Although Eq. (1) clearly distinguishes these
two parts it is not useful in practical applications since it
would require the calculation of G. From the above dis-
cussion one would expect a link between f (1)
xc and the
derivative discontinuity of ground-state DFT [25, 26],
which is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the fundamen-
tal gap and the Kohn-Sham gap. One of the goals of this
work is to make this link explicit.

In order to obtain this formal link we ﬁrst generalize

the two-point KS polarizability to four points: [27]

the χKS(ω) matrix representation has two blocks, one
representing the resonant part (excitation energies) and
the other one the antiresonant part (de-excitation ener-
gies). In particular, the lowest KS excitation energy is
ǫVBM, with ǫCBM and ǫVBM the
given by ω1 = ǫCBM −
KS energy of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and
the KS energy of the valence band maximum (VBM),
respectively.

We now assume that also χ0 is diagonal in the Kohn-
Sham basis. This is an approximation, but it is in accor-
dance with various practical calculations, in particular
those based on the GW method, in which χ0 is built
with KS orbitals [17, 29]. We can thus write

respectively), and η is a positive inﬁnitesimal that en-
sures causality. For the solids we study here i and a are
multi-indices composed of a band index (comprising the
spin) and a Bloch vector, k and k′, respectively. We note
that, although the ﬁnal goal is the description of optical

equal to minus the KS energy at the VBM, i.e., I =
ǫVBM [30–32]. Since an equivalent relation holds for
−
the N + 1 system, i.e., the system with one additional
electron, and the fact that A should be equal to the ﬁrst
ionization potential of the N + 1 system, one can deduce
that A =

Eq. (8) as

VBM −
Although Eq. (9) seems a simple expression, it is not
easy to calculate in practice. The problem arises from the
fact that ǫN +1
VBM is diﬃcult to evaluate in solids since they
are usually described within the thermodynamic limit,
which implies an inﬁnite number of electrons from the
outset. However, ǫN +1
ǫCBM is equal to ∆, the diﬀer-
ence between the fundamental gap Eg and the KS gap
EKS [26, 32, 33]. This diﬀerence is also known as the
derivative discontinuity [25, 26]. Therefore we arrive at
the following relation,

VBM −

4f (1)

xc,00 = ∆.

(10)

This is one of the main results of this work.

Assuming a rigid shift of the conduction bands, 4f (1)
xc
can thus be approximated by 4f (1)
xc = ∆ 4I, where 4I is the
four-point identity matrix in transition space. In prac-
tice, however, we prefer to use two-point quantities for
numerical eﬃciency. Therefore, it might be tempting to
rotate 4f (1)
xc to a two-point kernel. However, this would
lead to a very complicated frequency-dependent quantity
and would hence be very diﬃcult to apply in practice
[34]. We will avoid this problem by including the eﬀect
of 4f (1)
xc on the four-point response function in transition
space and only afterwards rotating the latter to its two-
point real-space representation.

We thus introduce a modiﬁed four-point Kohn-Sham

where the superscript (1) indicates that χ(1)

Eq. (4), and taking the diagonal part of the resulting ex-
pression we obtain the following expression for the mod-
iﬁed two-point KS polarizability,

readily obtain the inverse dielectric function ε−
1 + vcχ(ω). The optical spectra are obtained from the
imaginary part of ǫM (ω), the macroscopic part of ǫ(ω):

εM (ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω).

(14)

In order to apply our approach in practice we have
to use an approximation for ∆. As ﬁrst proposed by
Kuisma et al.
[35] and further discussed by Baerends
[32], ∆ can be approximated in terms of simple ground-
state KS-DFT quantities according to

The expression in Eq. (15) can be obtained from the
GLLB (Gritsenko-van Leeuwen-van Lenthe-Baerends)
approximation to the ground-state xc potential derived
in Ref.
[36]. The GLLB functional is an approximation
to the response part of the exact exchange optimized ef-
fective potential. A detailed derivation of Eq. (15) is
given by Baerends [32]. The constant Kx can be ob-
tained from the uniform electron gas, where the GLLB
exchange response potential becomes exact. [62] Funda-
mental gaps calculated using the derivative discontinuity
in Eq. (15) have been reported for a large number of
solids. [32, 35, 37–39]. In general, the results are excel-
lent. We note, however, that for gapped materials for
which the KS band gap is zero, the correction in Eq. (15)
is zero as well. One ﬁnds the same problem when calcu-
lating a G0W0 band gap on top of a KS metallic band
structure.

In practice, we use a slight generalization of TDDFT,
namely TD-current-DFT (TDCDFT) [40–43]. The prac-
tical details of how we solve the KS equations within
TDCDFT can be found elsewhere [44–49]. In particular
our method works in real space with two-point quantities
and we calculate the macroscopic polarization induced by
a macroscopic electric ﬁeld in terms of the macroscopic
current. This allows us to have optical spectra with the
correct optical gap and excitonic eﬀects at the cost of
an RPA calculation, i.e., O(N 3) scaling instead of the
O(N 6) for methods working in transition space. We ap-
proximate f (2)
xc with the polarization functional (PF) of
Ref. [8] which accurately describes the excitonic eﬀects
in various systems. We will refer to the full kernel, i.e.,
f (1,GLLB)
, as the Pure kernel to highlight the
xc
fact that it is based on pure Kohn-Sham theory. We
implemented our approach in a modiﬁed version of the
Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) code [53–55]. We

illustrate our approach by applying it to the calculation of
the optical spectra of two very diﬀerent classes of solids,
standard semiconductors (Si, GaP, GaAs) and wide-gap
insulators (C, Ar, LiF). We use the following lattice pa-
rameters: 5.43 ˚A for Si, 5.42 ˚A for GaP, 5.654 ˚A for GaAs,
3.534 ˚A for diamond, 4.026 ˚A for LiF, and 5.26 ˚A for solid
argon. Moreover, we use the TZ2P (triple-ζ + 2 polariza-
tion functions) and QZ4P (quadruple-ζ + 4 polarization
functions) basis sets provided by ADF for bulk silicon
and LiF and for GaP, GaAs, diamond, and solid argon,
respectively. The k-space integrals are done analytically
using a Lehmann-Taut tetrahedron scheme [56]. The
ground-state calculations are done within the GLLB-SC
xc potential
[32, 35, 36], which is based on the PBEsol
[57] correlation potential and uses the GLLB approx-
imation to the exchange optimized eﬀective potential.
For GaP and GaAs we also include scalar relativistic ef-
fects. The GLLB-SC values we obtained for ∆ and the
fundamental gap are reported in Table I. We note that
the approximation f (2,P F )
induces a gap renormalization
[24, 58]; this is clear from the example of solid argon for
which we have an optical gap of about 11.6 eV, which is
about 3 eV smaller than the (direct) fundamental gap.

In Figs. 1, 2, and 3 we report the dielectric function
of bulk Si, GaP, and GaAs, respectively, calculated with
the Pure functional at 0 Kelvin and compare it to the
RPA spectrum as well as to the experimental spectrum
obtained at 30 Kelvin for Si, 15 Kelvin for GaP, and 22
Kelvin for GaAs.

The Pure kernel yields an absorption spectrum that is
in good agreement with the experimental measurements
for the three systems. In particular, the peak positions
and the excitonic eﬀects are well reproduced. Also, the
real part of the dielectric function obtained with the
Pure kernel compares well to the experiment.
Instead,
the RPA spectrum exhibits the well-known shortcomings
mentioned before, i.e., the underestimation of the absorp-
tion onset and the absence of excitonic eﬀects. In case of
GaAs the RPA spectra are already in overall good agree-
ment with experiment, and the Pure kernel only slightly
improves the exciton position and intensity. Note that
the splitting of the ﬁrst peak in the experimental spec-
trum of GaAs is not reproduced in the calculated spec-
trum, because it is due to spin-orbit coupling, which is

neglected in our calculations. We note that the theo-
retical spectra have more structure than the experimen-
tal spectrum because it is calculated at 0 Kelvin and no
broadening parameter is used to simulate temperature ef-
fects. In Figs. 4, 5, and 6 we show the dielectric function
of diamond, LiF, and solid argon, respectively, calculated
with the Pure kernel at 0 Kelvin and compare it to the
RPA spectrum as well as to the experimental spectrum
obtained at room temperature. We see that the onset of
the absorption is well-reproduced as is the full spectrum,
except for an overestimation of the intensity of the bound
exciton in LiF and solid Ar. We note that this overesti-
mation is common to similar kernels derived to describe
excitonic eﬀetcs [5, 7]. Unfortunately, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no experimental data of ǫ1(ω) of solid
Ar.

In conclusion, we have made explicit the link between
the derivative discontinuity of ground-state DFT and the
xc kernel of TDDFT. Using this link we proposed the
Pure kernel, which combines the derivative discontinuity
and the polarization functional, to describe optical spec-
tra. We showed that it yields optical spectra in good
agreement with experiment for typical examples of stan-
dard semiconductors and wide-gap insulators. The cen-
tral issue here is that these results were obtained within a
pure KS approach without resorting to empirical data or
approaches that go beyond TDDFT. Finally we note that
the kernel we propose in this work is an approximation to
the TDDFT kernel fxc, it hence can in principle be used
