ABSTRACT

Coronal magnetic ﬁelds are responsible for the onset of solar ﬂares and so-

lar eruptions. However, the type of magnetic ﬁeld parameters that can be used

to measure the critical condition for a solar eruption is still unclear. As an ef-

fort to understand the possible condition for a solar ﬂare, we have examined the

non-dimensional parameter κ introduced by Ishiguro & Kusano (2017), which

contains information about magnetic twist distribution and magnetic ﬂux in an

active region (AR). We introduce a new parameter κ∗, as a proxy for κ, and

we have analyzed the evolution of κ∗ during the ﬂaring period of an AR us-

ing the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolated from the photospheric

vector magnetic ﬁeld data. Using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory

(SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have calculated κ∗ for the

AR NOAA 11158 during its three-day ﬂaring period. We found that κ∗ increased

to a certain level before two large ﬂares and decreased signiﬁcantly after their

onset. The results suggest that κ∗ may be used as an indicator of the necessary

condition for the onset of a solar eruption in the AR. Based on this result, we

propose a new method to assess the possibility of a large solar eruption from an

AR by combining the parameter κ∗ and information about the magnetic energy

of the AR.

Introduction

Large solar ﬂares are generated from regions in the photosphere near the magnetic

polarity inversion lines (PILs), which contain highly sheared magnetic ﬁelds, with the

horizontal ﬁelds nearly parallel to the PIL. Since the magnetic helicity must be well

conserved, the shearing motion and the emerging of sheared magnetic ﬁeld in the

photosphere can carry the helicity to the chromosphere and corona to form high-twist

ﬁeld lines or ﬂux rope (Hagyard et al. 1984; Berger 1998; Priest et al. 2016). Previous

studies showed that the twist as a component of magnetic helicity can be important

since a highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld can be subject to the helical kink instability

(Hood & Priest 1979; Einaudi & van Hoven 1983). An active region (AR) that contains

a highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld tends to produce a ﬂare when the twist reaches a critical

instability state. The threshold for the kink instability may vary depending on the

conﬁguration of the magnetic structure. Theoretical studies have shown that in the

ideal line-tying condition, the critical threshold for the twist of a ﬂux rope is ∼1.25

turns or ∼2.5π radians (Hood & Priest 1979). Previous studies, using simulation of the

Titov & Demoulin’s (1999) equilibrium, found that the twist of a helical kink unstable

coronal conﬁguration must exceed a certain threshold (Fan & Gibson 2004). T¨or¨ok et al.

(2004) found this threshold to be ∼3.5π radians. However, extracting twist information

from observations is very challenging. Several authors have tried to determine the twist via

various techniques. For example, Rust & Kumar (1996) used the ratio of length to width,

Leka et al. (2005); Malanushenko et al. (2011) employed the best-ﬁt of linear force-free ﬁelds

to the observations, and Leka & Barnes (2007) examined moments of a twist parameter.

Bobra et al. (2016) used the mean value of force-free parameter (alpha) as a proxy for the

twist in their prediction method, but they found that it was not a signiﬁcant predictor

for coronal mass ejection (CME). Leamon et al. (2003) argued that the pre-ﬂare coronal

ﬁelds in ARs rarely have suﬃcient twist for the kink instability. However, from their study

– 4 –

of many sigmoids, Rust & LaBonte (2005) showed observational evidence for the kink

instability in solar ﬁlament eruptions.

Recent studies have attempted to calculate the twist of the ﬁeld lines from a nonlinear

force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model based on the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data (Inoue et al.

2011, 2013, 2016; Guo et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2016). With a NLFFF model, one can calculate

the twist of each ﬁeld line to determine the distribution of twist for the whole AR. However,

it is still debatable how to deﬁne the twist of a ﬂux rope that consists of many ﬁeld lines

(Liu et al. 2016). Pevstov et al. (2014) suggested that a proper deﬁnition of magnetic

twist for an AR should be normalized by the magnetic ﬂux, since the number of ﬁeld lines

is inﬁnite. Liu et al. (2016) showed that an NLFFF model can reconstruct a high-twist

magnetic ﬂux rope that exceeds the kink instability threshold before a ﬂare. They suggested

that the twist of the ﬂux rope axis can be used as a parameter in forecasting solar eruption.

Several studies based on the NLFFF models for diﬀerent ARs have shown that the pre-ﬂare

coronal ﬁelds are weakly twisted (Bobra et al. 2008; Inoue et al. 2014b, 2015). Inoue et al.

(2015) pointed out that a triggering mechanism associated with magnetic reconnection

may make it possible for a magnetic structure with a twist less than the kink instability

threshold to produce a ﬂare. Therefore, it may not be necessary for a magnetic structure in

an AR to have a twist greater than 1.25 turns in order to produce a ﬂare, even if the kink

instability works as the driver for the main phase of the ﬂare.

Other theories have been developed to explain the mechanism of solar ﬂare. When two

magnetic arcades are close to each other, tether-cutting reconnection near the footpoints

of the loops can cause an eruption (Moore et al. 2001). The creation of magnetic ﬂux

rope in the corona can happen through this tether-cutting mechanism or ﬂux cancellation

in the photosphere (Schmieder et al. 2015). According to the magnetic break out model,

reconnection can also happen in the null points when magnetic loops interact with an

– 5 –

overlying ﬁeld that will eventually lead to an eruption (Antiochos et al. 1999; Wyper et al.

2017). A solar eruption can also be caused by torus instability (TI) when the current

inside the ﬂux tube is strong enough to generate hoop force that is larger than the

strapping force from the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the ﬂux tube (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006;

Demoulin & Aulanier 2010). In this kind of instability, how fast the external magnetic ﬁeld

change with height, which is deﬁned by the decay index (n), is important to determine the

critical condition of the eruption. Demoulin & Aulanier (2010) conﬁrmed previous studies

by Bateman (1978) and Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006) that the TI will grow when n >1.5. The

constraint of the decay index can prevent the eruption (CME) although the magnetic twist

of the ﬂux rope exceeds the critical limit for kink instability (Amari et al. 2018). Recently,

Ishiguro & Kusano (2017) studied the stability of a double-arc current carrying loop that

can be formed by a tether-cutting reconnection between two loops and introduced the

double-arc instability (DAI). Since the driving force of the DAI is the hoop force acting on

the loop as same as the TI, these two instabilities can be categorized into the same group,

which can be called the “hoop-force-driven” instability. However, the magnetic structure for

the DAI is more complex than a simple torus. Therefore, the critical parameter of the DAI

is not same as that of the TI. The critical condition of the DAI is given by a new parameter

κ, whereas the critical condition of the TI is determined by the decay index n. Because of

that, the magnetic structure is able to be unstable to the DAI even though the external

ﬁeld is not decayed and the DAI can grow in a portion lower than the critical height of the

TI as shown by Ishiguro & Kusano (2017). On the other hand, although the DAI can drive

the initial phase of ﬂare, the TI may play a crucial role to make a full eruption and CME,

because the DAI can explain only the process in which the double-arc loop formed by the

tether-cutting reconnection expands to a simple torus.

Several studies of ﬂare trigger mechanisms have shown that both highly sheared

ﬁeld and reconnection among some ﬁeld lines are required in order to produce a ﬂare

– 6 –

(Kusano et al. 2012; Muhamad et al. 2017). These studies used MHD simulations to

show that both the conﬁguration of the pre-existing magnetic ﬁeld near the PIL and the

orientation of small-scale magnetic disturbances on the PIL are important for triggering

a ﬂare. Therefore, having a large free energy accumulated in a strongly sheared magnetic

ﬁeld is necessary, but not suﬃcient for producing a ﬂare. This result is consistent with the

theory of the DAI. From numerical analyses of the stability of a double-arc electric current

loop, Ishiguro & Kusano (2017) suggested that the magnetic twist and the reconnected ﬂux

may play complementary roles in triggering a ﬂare. If a double-arc loop can be formed by a

reconnection between two sheared ﬁeld lines, as in the tether-cutting scenario (Moore et al.

2001), the κ parameter deﬁned as

κ = Tw

φrec
φtot

,

(1)

can be used to measure the critical condition of the DAI, where Tw is the twist of a magnetic

loop and φrec/φtot is the fraction of the reconnected ﬂux over the total ﬂux crossing over the

considered PIL.

In their study, Ishiguro & Kusano (2017) found that when the value of κ exceeds a

threshold κ0, a double-arc electric current loop becomes unstable. The threshold κ0 varies

from approximately 0.08 to 0.175, depending on the external magnetic ﬁeld enveloping the

double-arc structure. This suggests that the magnetic twist and tether-cutting reconnection

are important in destabilizing sheared magnetic ﬁeld (Ishiguro & Kusano 2017). However,

calculating the value of κ for an AR is not trivial, because the observational data lack

information about the magnetic twist and the reconnected ﬂux. Although one can determine

the force-free alpha parameter from magnetogram data, those data contain no information

about the length of magnetic loops that can be used to derive the twist. Moreover, the

reconnected ﬂux, which is required to calculate κ, is hardly known from observations.

Therefore, it is important to develop a way to calculate κ in an AR to understand the

characteristics pattern of its evolution before and after a large ﬂare happens.

– 7 –

We have employed DAI analysis to study ﬂares in the AR NOAA 11158. The evolution

of the magnetic ﬁeld in this AR have been extensively studied, e.g. regarding the magnetic

structure (Sun et al. 2012; Toriumi et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2014; Malanushenko et al. 2014),

magnetic helicity (Jing et al. 2012; Dalmasse et al. 2013; Tziotziou et al. 2013; Zhang et al.

2016), photospheric ﬁeld (Liu et al. 2012; Petrie 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Petrie 2013),

magnetic energy (Sun et al. 2012; Aschwanden et al. 2014; Malanushenko et al. 2014),

magnetic twist (Liu et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2012; Inoue et al. 2011, 2014b; Zhao et al. 2014;

Malanushenko et al. 2014), and others. Observational studies suggested that tether-cutting

reconnection happened in the AR during the M6.6 (Liu et al. 2012) and X2.2 (Wang et al.

2012; Liu et al. 2013) ﬂares. This suggests that double-arc current structure occurred in

the AR, and thus DAI analysis can be applied to explain the occurrences of these ﬂares.

Our goal is to ﬁnd a parameter that can be used to study the capability to produce a

solar ﬂare by implementing such a DAI analysis for a real AR. First, we study the spatial

and temporal evolution of the twist distribution of the AR based on the NLFFF model.

Next, we calculate a parameter to enable us to extract information about the twist and

to determine the reconnected ﬂux. Finally, we show how our proposed parameter can be

used as a possible forewarning for the likelihood of ﬂare occurrence in an AR. This paper is

organized as follows: Data for the AR and the method we used in our study, are described

in Section 2. Section 3 presents the results of the NLFFF extrapolations and describes the

evolution of the twist and other parameters. There, we also use our results to discuss some

issues related to the necessary condition of the AR for a ﬂare. Finally, we summarize and

conclude our paper in Section 4.

2. DATA AND METHOD

2.1. Observed Data and the NLFFF Model

We have used Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager

(HMI) observations of the vector magnetic ﬁeld from the Spaceweather HMI Active

Region Patch (SHARP) (Bobra et al. 2014). SHARP data have a 12-minute cadence of

observations, in which the magnetic ﬂux has been remapped to a Lambert Cylindrical

Equal-Area (CEA) projection1. These data contain the three components of the vector

magnetic ﬁeld (Br, Bφ, Bθ) obtained from a very fast inversion of the Stokes vector

using Milne-Eddington model for the solar atmosphere (Borrero et al. 2011). The 180-deg

ambiguity is resolved by using the minimum-energy method (Leka et al. 2009). We used

a three-hour cadence of the SHARP data for AR 11158, extending from 00:00 UT on

2011-Feb-13 to 21:00 UT on 2011-Feb-15 with 744×377 pixels covering about 268×134

Mm2. For detailed analyses of two large ﬂares that occurred during this period, we used the

12-minute cadence of the SHARP data from 15:00−18:00 UT 2011-Feb-13, when M6.6 ﬂare

happened, and 00:00−03:00 UT 2011-Feb-15, when X2.2 ﬂare occurred.

We reduced the original vector magnetogram data by using IDL CONGRID function

with the nearest-neighbour interpolation to 256×128 pixels, which we used as bottom

boundaries for extrapolating the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. We employed the NLFFF

extrapolation technique to reconstruct the coronal magnetic ﬁeld by applying the

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) relaxation method (Inoue et al. 2014a) in a computational

box of 256×128×128 grids. First, we calculated the potential ﬁeld for the AR from

the normal component (Br) of the given boundary condition using the Fourier method

1The HMI SHARP (CEA) data (hmi.sharp cea 720s) is available on the Joint Science

Operation Center (JSOC), Stanford University (http://jsoc.stanford.edu/).

– 9 –

(Alissandrakis 1981). The tangential components (Bφ, Bθ) then incrementally changed at

the bottom boundary to match the observational tangential components. Next, we calculate

a set of MHD-like equations until the solution approaches the force-free ﬁeld (for the details

of MHD relaxation method see Inoue et al. (2014a)). All the physical variables at all the

boundaries are ﬁxed during the iteration. The method and parameters used here are similar

to the NLFFF calculations in our previous work (Muhamad et al. 2017).

2.2. Calculating κ∗-Parameter

To derive information similar to that embodied in the parameter κ from the

observational data, we propose the alternative parameter namely κ∗ that is deﬁned as

follows:

with dφ = |Br|dS.

κ∗
Tc = R

|Tw| dφ

Tw
Tc

>1

φtot

,

(2)

In this formula, instead of using the reconnected ﬂux, which is not measurable, we

integrate the magnetic twist only over the high-twist area as a function of magnetic ﬂux

(φ). The threshold for the integrated magnetic twist is given by Tc. The concept of

replacing the reconnected ﬂux with the high-twist ﬂux is based on the assumption that

internal reconnection between high-twist ﬁeld lines in the pre-ﬂare phase is more eﬀective

in enhancing the creation of higher twist ﬂux ropes, which can be expected to drive a ﬂare

(Demoulin & Aulanier 2010). This assumption is supported by the fact that ﬂares usually

come from the core of an AR, which contains highly twisted ﬁeld lines, and which stores a

large free energy. In fact, the NLFFFs of several ARs showed that the shapes and locations

of ﬂare ribbons are very well matched with the footpoint locations of the highly twisted

ﬁeld lines (Inoue et al. 2013, 2016; Liu et al. 2016). Therefore, it is likely that a ﬂare is

– 10 –

triggered by the reconnection of high-twist ﬁeld.

The deﬁnition of κ∗

Tc requires a proper threshold (Tc) to determine the high-twist

area, since this can aﬀect the overall estimation of κ∗

Tc. Inoue et al. (2014b) found that

the maximum twist value of the AR 11158 was less than unity before the ﬂare. A few of

ﬁeld lines had twist more than 0.5, although most of the ﬁeld lines had smaller values.

Inoue et al. (2011, 2016) showed that ARs 10930 and 12192 also had similar magnetic twist

properties. Based on those results (Inoue et al. (2011, 2014b, 2016)) we have employed 0.5

as a benchmark for the high-twist threshold and have surveyed the dependence of κ∗

Tc on

Tc around this value (0.5). Another possible way to determine Tc is by analyzing the twist

distribution after a ﬂare occurs. This distribution can be expected to change, because the

ﬂare relaxes the magnetic twist. Magnetic ﬁeld will thus tend to have lower twist values

after a ﬂare. Magnetic ﬂux that loses twist can be considered to be reconnected ﬂux.

Therefore, the maximum twist value of the ﬁeld remaining after a ﬂare, denoted by Tm, can

be used as a minimum threshold for determining the high-twist ﬁeld before the ﬂare. Here,

we ﬁrst try to calculate κ∗

0.5, and we then compare it with κ∗

Tm, which we compute using

coronal magnetic ﬁeld reconstructed from NLFFF extrapolation. The twist of a ﬁeld line is

calculated from the following deﬁnition of magnetic twist (Berger & Prior 2006):

Here, alpha is the force-free parameter

Tw =

1
4π Z

α dl.

α =

∇ × B · B
|B|2

,

(3)

(4)

which is calculated for each point in a computational box along a ﬁeld line, where l is the

length coordinate along the ﬁeld line. The magnetic twist is thus deﬁned as a function

of each ﬁeld line. This deﬁnition was also used by Inoue et al. (2015, 2016) to calculate

the twist. We then evaluate equation (2) for several diﬀerent values of Tc at each diﬀerent

epoch.

– 11 –

In the weak ﬁeld region, there are big numerical errors in the calculation of α, and the

evaluation of the magnetic twist is less reliable. Therefore, we exclude the magnetic ﬁeld

lines coming from weak ﬁeld regions by using a minimum ﬁeld threshold in the calculation.

In this work, we only consider magnetic ﬂux density larger than 140 G in calculating κ∗

Tc.

The total ﬂux (φtot) in equation (2) is deﬁned as the total unsigned ﬂux, which is the closed

ﬁeld within the core of the AR. This excludes ﬂuxes for which the ﬁeld lines are open or

their connectivity is beyond the area within the core of the AR, where the center of the

ﬂare ribbons was observed during the ﬂares.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. NLFF Results

AR 11158 initially occurred as two simple bipoles before growing to become complex

quadrupole systems. Rotational and translational motions of the spots were observed

within the AR (Jiang et al. 2012); these caused the magnetic ﬁeld near the PIL to become

sheared and elongated (Toriumi et al. 2014). Figures 1(a), (b), and (c) show the coronal

magnetic ﬁeld of AR 11158 observed by AIA 171 ˚A at three diﬀerent times. AR 11158

produced many ﬂares and CMEs during its passage across the solar disk. In this paper, we

focus on the M6.6 ﬂare, which occurred on 2011 February 13 at 17:28 UT, and on the X2.2

ﬂare, which happened on 2011 February 15 at 01:44 UT. These ﬂares occurred in the core

of the AR, which is marked by the orange rectangle in Figure 1(g).

NLFFF extrapolation provides the reconstructed coronal magnetic ﬁeld for AR 11158

from 2011 February 13 − 2011 February 15 (Figures 1(d), (e), and (f)). The ﬁeld lines

(yellow lines) within the core of the AR have arcade-like structure with a relatively

strong twist mainly near the PIL. These ﬁgures show that the magnetic ﬁeld evolved

– 12 –

during this period. Although we did not quantitatively compare the ﬁeld lines with the

observation, in general, the reconstructed coronal ﬁelds morphologies match with the

observations in Figures 1(a), (b) and (c). The general morphologies and the locations of the

high-twist ﬁelds also in agreement with many previous studies (Jing et al. 2012; Sun et al.

2012; Dalmasse et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013; Inoue et al. 2013, 2014b;

Aschwanden et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2014; Malanushenko et al. 2014). Unlike Zhao et al.

(2014) who could identify the twisted ﬂux rope from the topology of the reconstructed

coronal ﬁeld, we could not ﬁnd obvious topological signature of ﬂux rope existing in our

NLFFF during our analysis time window. It might be due to the fact that there were

few magnetic ﬂux with twist higher than one-turn in our NLFFF and it is diﬃcult to be

topologically deﬁned as a ﬂux rope. However, our result is consistent with other NLFFF

results (Jing et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013; Inoue et al.

2014b; Malanushenko et al. 2014). The high twist region in our result also in agreement

with the region with high helicity ﬂux (Dalmasse et al. 2013) and the location of the ﬂare

ribbons (Bamba et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2013), as well as the high current density region

(Janvier et al. 2014). Figures 1 (g), (h), and (i) show the evolution of the twist distribution

map, with the magnetic twist of the ﬁeld lines plotted at the footpoints of ﬁeld lines

according to a color scale. This shows that the high-twist (strongly right-handed twist

corresponding to Tw > 0.5) areas are concentrated in only a limited part of the AR. The

high-twist area grew and became even more twisted just before the X2.2 ﬂare (Figure 1(i)).

Most parts of the AR have twist values less than 0.25, but near the PIL the twist can

reach more than 0.5, even up to about a full turn. This is consistent with the results of

Sun et al. (2012) and Inoue et al. (2014b). A high-twist (strong negative/left-handed twist)

area also developed in the eastern part of the AR, which did not exist initially on February

13. Both of these high-twist areas produced several ﬂares. However, here we focus on the

ﬂares resulted from the high-twist core region near the center of the AR, where the M6.6

– 13 –

and X2.2 ﬂares occurred.

3.2. Twist Distribution and Evolution

3.2.1. 2011 February 13 (M6.6 Flare Event)

In order to examine the evolution of twist before and after M6.6 ﬂare, we plotted the

distribution of magnetic twist in the core of AR 11158 from 15:00−18:00 UT on 2011 Feb 13

with a 12-minute cadence. Note that M6.6 ﬂare started at around 17:28 UT. We obtained

the twist distribution by binning the absolute value of twist with increments of 0.05 and

then summing the magnetic ﬂux of the Br component, which corresponds to the footpoints

of the ﬁeld lines for which we calculated the twist within the area in Figure 1. We excluded

ﬁeld from areas with weak magnetic ﬁeld (less than 280 G) in order to eliminate noise. The

plot of the amount of magnetic ﬂux as a function of its corresponding twist, normalized by

7.72 × 1021 Mx, is presented in each panel of Figure 2, which shows the evolution of the

twist distribution of AR 11158 before and after M6.6 ﬂare. In general, most ﬁeld lines had

only small amount of twist, with values less than 0.2 turn. However, several ﬁeld lines had

a twist exceeding 0.5 or even 0.8 turn before the ﬂare occurred. After the ﬂare, almost all

twists of the high-twist magnetic ﬁeld gradually reduced to less than 0.6 turn. This result

is consistent with the result of Liu et al. (2012).

The selected spatial evolution of the magnetic twist distribution in AR 11158 during

the three-hour period from 15:00−18:00 UT on February 13 is presented in Figure 3.

This ﬁgure shows how the high-twist (larger than 0.5 turn) ﬁeld area (enclosed by the

green contour) intensiﬁed, with the magnetic ﬂux was 1.6 × 1021 Mx, just before the ﬂare

(17:12 UT) and then shrank signiﬁcantly to 3.6 × 1020 Mx after the ﬂare (18:00 UT). This

suggested that magnetic helicity might have been transferred from the core of the AR to the

– 14 –

upper region where the magnetic ﬁeld erupted during the ﬂare to the interplanetary space.

The results of the twist distribution and evolution before and after the ﬂare are consistent

with the result of Inoue et al. (2013).

3.2.2. 2011 February 15 (X2.2 Flare Event)

X2.2 ﬂare started around 01:44 UT on February 15. To study the evolution of magnetic

twist in AR 11158 before and after the ﬂare, we plotted the twist distribution in the AR

from 00:00−03:00 UT on February 15 with a 12-minute cadence. Selected plots of the twist

distribution are shown in Figure 4. Over this time period, the trend was similar to the

development of the twist distribution for the M6.6 ﬂare. However, before the X2.2 ﬂare,

more ﬁeld existed with twist higher than 0.5, or even larger than 0.8 turn. This shows

that, during this period, the magnetic ﬁeld of AR 11158 had stronger shear than before

the previous event. Field with twist higher than 0.8 turn mostly disappeared after the

ﬂare. This is also similar to the previous event, although the AR retained more ﬂux with

magnetic twist higher than 0.5 even one hour after the peak of the ﬂare.

We also plotted contours for magnetic ﬁeld with twist higher than 0.5 over the Br

component of the magnetogram data for the period 00:00−03:00 UT on February 15 with a

12-minute cadence. Selected plots of these images are shown in Figure 5. The region with

magnetic twist higher than 0.5 did not exhibit signiﬁcant changes before the ﬂare (2 × 1021

Mx at 01:36 UT), but it gradually reduced in size just after the ﬂare (1.9 × 1021 Mx at 02:12

UT). However, high-twist region with Tw > 0.6 decreased from 1.45 × 1021 Mx before the
ﬂare (01:36 UT) to 7 × 1020 Mx after the ﬂare (02:12 UT). Unlike M6.6 ﬂare, high-twist ﬂux

still remained in relatively large area, instead of signiﬁcantly disappearing. This implies

that AR 11158 still retained a signiﬁcant amount of free energy. These results of the twist

distribution and evolution before and after the ﬂare are also consistent with the result of

Inoue et al. (2013).

3.3. Evolution of κ∗

After we calculated and analyzed the twist, we calculated κ∗

Tc using equation (2) with

diﬀerent thresholds (Tc). We used the ﬁrst threshold, 0.5, as a benchmark to explore the
general trend of the evolution. The evolution of the GOES X-ray ﬂux, κ∗

0.5, and the total

magnetic energy are shown in Figures 6 (a), (b), and (c), respectively. The three-hour

cadence data are used to make the evolutionary plot of κ∗

0.5 and the total magnetic energy.

We used the 12-minute cadence data around the time when the two big ﬂares occurred

in the core of the AR, on February 13, from 15:00−18:00 UT and on February 15, from

00:00−03:00 UT. Note that κ∗

0.5 increased before the ﬂares and decreased abruptly just after

the ﬂares.

For a more detailed analysis, we have plotted in Figures 7 (a) and (b) the evolution of

the GOES X-ray ﬂux during M6.6 and X2.2 ﬂare, respectively. We also plotted in Figures 7

(c) and (e) the evolution of κ∗

Tc and free energy, each with a 12-minute cadence, just before

and just after the M6.6 ﬂare, respectively. We used three diﬀerent values for the threshold

(Tc) for the high-twist ﬂux for this event (shown as diﬀerent colored lines in Figure 7 (c)).

The ﬁrst threshold (Tc = 0.5; red line) is the benchmark. We obtained the second threshold

(Tc = 0.6; green line) from the highest value of the magnetic twist after the ﬂare (Tm), as

can be seen from the last panel in Figure 2. The third threshold (Tc = 0.55; blue line) is

just the mean value between the ﬁrst and second, which we used for comparison. Figure

7(c) shows that κ∗

Tc increased for each value of Tc before the ﬂare and then signiﬁcantly

decreased just after the ﬂare started. The trend is similar for all three thresholds, although
Tc becomes smaller for higher Tc. It is interesting that the maximum κ∗
κ∗

Tm is slightly greater

than 0.1. This is consistent with the theoretical threshold for κ in DAI analysis done by

– 16 –

Ishiguro & Kusano (2017). Note that the free magnetic energy decreased slightly after the

ﬂare, which shows that some energy was released during the ﬂare.

In Figures 7(d) and (f), we plotted the same parameters as in Figures 7(c) and (e),

but for X2.2 ﬂare. We also used three diﬀerent thresholds (Tc) for the high-twist ﬂux

(shown as diﬀerent lines in Figure 7 (d). The ﬁrst threshold (Tc = 0.5; red line) is again the

benchmark threshold. The second (Tc = 0.75; green line) is the highest twist of the ﬁeld

after the ﬂare (Tm) (see the last panel in Figure 4). The third threshold (Tc = 0.625; blue

line) is the mean between the ﬁrst and second, which we have again used for comparison.

Note that κ∗

Tc increased long before the X2.2 ﬂare occurred. Figure 6(b) shows that this

increase began on February 14 around 00:00 UT and exceeded 0.2 around 04:00 UT, which

corresponded to the phase when the AR resumed the ﬂare activity producing the C8.3

ﬂare at 04:29 UT on February 14. However, after the X2.2 ﬂare happened, κ∗

Tc decreased
signiﬁcantly, just as it did following the M6.6 ﬂare event. Note also in Figure 7(d) that κ∗
Tm

(green line) has a maximum value slightly below 0.1. This value is again consistent with the

critical threshold for the DAI introduced by Ishiguro & Kusano (2017). Figure 7(f) shows

that the free energy was at the higher level before the X2.2 ﬂare than before the M6.6 ﬂare.

It increased during the ﬂare, and ﬁnally decreased after the X2.2 ﬂare.

3.4. Determination of Tc

We have found that the twist of magnetic ﬁeld in the AR evolved signiﬁcantly during

our three-day analysis time window. In general, the magnetic ﬁeld of the AR tended to

relax to a lower state after the ﬂares occurred. Because the coronal plasma just above the

core of the AR erupted, it carried some of the high-twist ﬁeld from the lower corona to

the higher corona or out into interplanetary space. Subsequently, the high-twist magnetic

ﬁeld in the core of the AR relaxed and the magnetic twists decreased. However, some of

– 17 –

the high-twist magnetic ﬁeld still remained there even after the ﬂares. This result that

magnetic twist decreased after the ﬂares is consistent with previous studies by Inoue et al.

(2013) and Liu et al. (2016).

Previous studies of ﬂare ribbons using footpoint displacement analyses in MHD

simulations (Toriumi et al. 2013; Inoue et al. 2015; Muhamad et al. 2017) and quasi

separatrix layers (QSL) in NLFFF models (Aulanier et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2013;

Janvier et al. 2014; Savcheva et al. 2016) have shown that the shapes and locations of ﬂare

ribbons usually correspond to the shapes and locations of the footpoints of the reconnected

ﬂux. Here, we have found that the contours and locations of the high-twist ﬁelds in Figures

3 and 5 correspond to the shapes and locations of the observed ﬂare ribbons for both ﬂares

in Figures 8 (b) and (d). During the ﬂares, reconnection thus tends to involve high-twist

ﬁelds. This result is consistent with the study by Inoue et al. (2015). It also supports

the idea that the reconnected ﬂux in equation (1) can be replaced by some part of the

high-twist ﬂux in equation (2), although they are not completely identical. Moreover,

the ﬂare ribbon marks the reconnected ﬂux during the ﬂare, while the reconnected ﬂux

in equation (1) only includes internal reconnection among the ﬁeld lines before the ﬂare.

Therefore, the high-twist ﬂux always overestimates the reconnected ﬂux in the pre-ﬂare

state. Consequently, κ∗

Tc generally has a higher value than the initial deﬁnition of κ.

The evolution of κ∗

Tc in Figures 7(c) and (d) suggests that the AR tended to have

relatively large value of κ∗

Tc before a ﬂare and it quickly decreased after the ﬂare. These

results suggest that we may be able to use κ∗

Tc as a useful parameter as a forewarning of a

ﬂare. However, it is still not clear how we can choose the threshold (Tc) for the magnetic

twist to use it as a ﬂare predictor. For both of the ﬂares we studied, when Tc = Tm,
the values of κ∗

Tc just prior to the eruption were around 0.1, which is consistent with the

critical value derived by Ishiguro & Kusano (2017). They found that the critical κ for the

– 18 –

DAI were 0.08 and 0.125, respectively, for a point source and for the external ﬁeld that

decay exponentially with altitude. We suggest that the maximum value of the remaining

high-twist ﬁeld (Tm), has more physical meaning than other values of twist as a proper

value of Tc for the high-twist ﬂux. Using this threshold reduces the possibility of including
non-reconnected ﬂux in calculating κ∗

Tc, which makes it more consistent with the theoretical

deﬁnition of κ.

3.5.

Importance of Trigger Structure

Our results show that κ∗

Tc increased about one day before the X2.2 ﬂare, while it

increased only about 6 hours before the M6.6 ﬂare. In order to understand the diﬀerent

features of these two ﬂares, we have investigated their trigger mechanisms by analyzing the

magnetogram data taken by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT). Figure 8 shows the

evolution of the core of the AR before and after the M6.6 and X2.2 ﬂares.

Bamba et al. (2013, 2014) found that M6.6 ﬂare was triggered by a relatively large

magnetic “peninsula”, in which a region with positive polarity intruded into the one with

negative polarity (the yellow circle in Figure 8(a)). The trigger structure (peninsula) was

formed since around Feb 13 13:00 UT by inﬂow of small positive magnetic patches from

the northern positive region (Toriumi et al. 2013). This caused the azimuth angle of the

magnetic ﬁeld on the west (the right side) boundary of the peninsula to be reversed from

that of the main sheared ﬁeld in the PIL, enabling reconnection on that boundary to

occur by means of the tether-cutting mechanism. This kind of trigger structure has been

deﬁned as a “reversed-shear” (RS) structure by Kusano et al. (2012). This suggests that

in the M6.6 ﬂare, the magnetic structure of the core of the AR was strongly perturbed by

the presence of the large peninsula structure before the ﬂare just after the κ∗

Tc increased

signiﬁcantly. Such a large peninsula structure can easily trigger a ﬂare if the magnetic twist

– 19 –

grows high enough, and this provides a possible explanation for the prompt onset of M6.6

ﬂare immediately after the value of κ∗

Tc exceeded the threshold.

On the other hand, X2.2 ﬂare was triggered by a small RS-structure near the PIL (the

yellow circle in Figure 8(c)). This small structure could hardly trigger a ﬂare, since it could

only perturb a small portion of the lower coronal ﬁeld (Bamba et al. 2013). In addition,

we found that the formation of the trigger structure (peninsula) for the X2.2 ﬂare just

started from around Feb 14 21:00 UT, which was about one day after the κ∗

Tc increased

signiﬁcantly. Hence, although helicity was continuously injected into the core of the AR,

the ﬁeld structure was able to maintain its high κ∗

Tc value for a relatively long period before

the structure of the small RS ﬁeld met the condition for instability. For that reason, more

free energy and magnetic helicity were stored before the onset of the ﬂare, and ﬁnally a

bigger ﬂare erupted than the previous one. This suggests that the structure of the trigger

ﬁeld is also important to complement the information provided by κ∗

Tc for estimating the

probability of the occurrence of a ﬂare.

3.6. Magnetic Energy

Analysis of the magnetic energy of the core region shows that the total energy increased

continuously during the three-day period covered by the data we used, as can be seen in

Figure 6 (c). Although from Figure 6(c) we see that the magnetic energy accumulating in

the AR increased continously during the three days of observation, the κ∗

0.5 proﬁle shows

dramatic changes before and after the ﬂares. This suggests that κ∗

0.5 can serve as a proxy

for the degree of DAI necessary for an AR to produce a ﬂare. On the other hand, the

total magnetic energy did not show signiﬁcant changes even during the ﬂares, and instead

increased almost monotonically. Ultimately, substantial amount of energy about 1.2 × 1032

erg was stored before the X2.2 ﬂare after the M6.6 ﬂare. This implies that the amount

– 20 –

of magnetic energy stored in the AR does not represent the critical condition for a ﬂare

to occur, but it may be related to the size of the event once a ﬂare does occur. Figures

7 (e) and (f) show that the free energy for M6.6 and X2.2 ﬂares, respectively, were also

at diﬀerent levels and that the free energy for the latter was almost twice that of the

former. Thus, signiﬁcant energy accumulated in the core of the AR from day to day. When

M6.6 ﬂare happened, the free energy decreased (≈8 %), showing that some of the energy

had been released by the ﬂare. A similar thing happened in the X2.2 ﬂare: some of the

energy was released and the free energy decreased. This energy evolution is consistent with

previous results by Sun et al. (2012); Aschwanden et al. (2014) and Malanushenko et al.

(2014), although we obtained a smaller energy level than they found because we calculated

the energy only for the core region. However, the general trend of the free energy was still

increasing even after the ﬂare happened, showing that using just the free energy proﬁle

to predict the occurrence of a ﬂare is somewhat problematic. This is because we cannot

diﬀerentiate the critical state required to trigger a ﬂare during the continuous accumulation

of energy in an AR, although the stored energy and helicity are related to the size and class

of a ﬂare once it occurs. Our result conﬁrmed that non-potential energy does not directly

provides necessary criterion for an eruption as it has been known in previous studies,

e.g. in Schrijver et al. (2005) and Jing et al. (2009). This is also consistent with previous

simulation study by Pariat et al. (2017). In this sense, analyzing the κ∗

Tc proﬁle can be more

helpful for monitoring the condition necessary to trigger a ﬂare and for evaluating how

likely it is that an AR may erupt. Information about the free energy is useful for estimating

the maximum size (class) of a ﬂare that can be produced in an AR.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have analyzed the evolution of magnetic twist, κ∗

Tc, and free energy for AR 11158.
During the three days of its ﬂare-active period, we found that the magnetic twist and κ∗
Tc

increased before M6.6 and X2.2 ﬂares, and then decreased just after the ﬂares. High-twist

magnetic ﬁeld accumulated in the core of the AR near the PIL before both the ﬂares. We

also found that the locations and shapes of the high-twist regions corresponded to the ﬂare

ribbons for both the ﬂares, which shows that reconnection during the ﬂares mostly involved

high-twist ﬁelds in the AR. We found that more high-twist ﬁeld remained after X2.2 ﬂare

in the AR than after M6.6 ﬂare. Accordingly, we suggest that the magnetic ﬁeld in the AR

relaxed considerably after M6.6 ﬂare, but it retained its strong shear after X2.2 ﬂare.

We have examined the values of κ∗

Tc as a proxy for the parameter κ in order to explore

the possibility of using this parameter to analyze the condition required for solar eruptions.

We found that the value of κ∗

Tc appeared to reach a certain level before a ﬂare happened.

This value of κ∗

Tc decreased signiﬁcantly after both the ﬂares, and to almost comparable

levels. This shows that κ∗

Tc provides a consistent behavior, so that it may be used to

analyze the condition necessary for the occurrence of a solar ﬂare. We suggest that the κ∗
Tc

value is related to the stability condition represented by the κ parameter introduced by

Ishiguro & Kusano (2017). We showed that the ratio of the high-twist ﬂux compared to the

total ﬂux in the AR can be important to assess the possibility of a solar ﬂare occurrence. It

is noted that recently Pariat et al. (2017) found the importance of the ratio of the current

helicity to the total helicity as a possible ﬂare trigger from their parametric simulations.

They speculated that this ratio may be related to the instability criterion of the torus

instability. Although we investigated high-twist ﬂux instead of helicity, since the helicity

and the twist are related, some characteristics between their parameter and κ may also be

related. We suggest that during the eruption process, a double-arc structure can develop

– 22 –

into a simple torus-like structure in the later phase. When it happens, it is possible that

the torus instability will work and the TI threshold will determine the eruption.

Moreover, we found that κ∗

Tc is very sensitive to the threshold (Tc) chosen to deﬁne the

high-twist ﬂux. Our analysis shows that the κ∗

Tc value is more consistent if the threshold

Tc is chosen as the maximum twist of the ﬂux remaining after a ﬂare. However, we found

that the Tm value is not the same for diﬀerent ﬂares. Figures 2 and 4 show that the

X2.2 ﬂare had a larger value of Tm than the M6.6 ﬂare. It is still an open issue how to
determine the threshold (Tm) before the onset of a ﬂare in order to use κ∗

Tm to predict a

ﬂare. One possibility is that Tm may be related to the ﬂare triggering process in which

some disturbance of the magnetic ﬁeld may play a role. It is likely that the value of Tm

should be higher (lower) if a smaller (larger) disturbance causes the triggering reconnection

of less (more) ﬂux. Further analysis of the evolution of κ∗

Tm for many more ﬂares and for

non-ﬂaring ARs is required to determine the proper value of Tm. However, the result of our

study suggests that DAI analysis can be applied to a real AR in the Sun as long as we can

obtain reliable values for the parameters required to calculate the κ.

We also found that the magnetic energy decreased slightly before the ﬂares, although

it increased almost continuously during three days ﬂare-active period. The free energy level

in the AR was diﬀerent for the two ﬂares we studied. The AR had a higher free energy

level before the X2.2 ﬂare than before the M6.6 ﬂare. However, we found that merely using

the free energy in an AR is not suﬃcient to predict the onset of a ﬂare, because it does not

contain information about the stability of the magnetic system in the AR. The free energy

level can indicate how large class of a ﬂare can be produced by an AR, while κ∗

Tm may be

useful as a parameter to indicate an impending eruption in an AR. We believe that further

studies based on the DAI analysis and its proxy parameter κ∗

Tm can be helpful in achieving

better understanding of the conditions necessary for a ﬂare.
