ABSTRACT

Context. Obtaining the magnetic ﬁeld vector accurately in the solar atmosphere is essential for studying changes in ﬁeld topology
during ﬂares and to reliably model space weather.
Aims. We tackle this problem by applying various inversion methods to a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare that occurred in NOAA AR 12673 on
September 6, 2017, and comparing the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld vector with those from two numerical models
of this event.
Methods. We obtain the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld from Milne-Eddington and (non-)local thermal equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions
of Hinode SOT/SP Fe i 6301.5 Å and 6302.5 Å. The chromospheric ﬁeld is obtained from a spatially-regularised weak ﬁeld approxi-
mation (WFA) and non-LTE inversions of Ca ii 8542 Å observed with CRISP at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We investigate the
ﬁeld strengths and photosphere-to-chromosphere shear in ﬁeld vector.
Results. The LTE- and non-LTE-inferred photospheric magnetic ﬁeld components are strongly correlated across several optical depths
in the atmosphere, with a tendency for stronger ﬁeld and higher temperatures in the non-LTE inversions. For the chromospheric ﬁeld,
the non-LTE inversions correlate well with the spatially-regularised WFA, especially in line-of-sight ﬁeld strength and ﬁeld vector
orientation. The photosphere exhibits coherent strong-ﬁeld patches of over 4.5 kG, co-located with similar concentrations exceeding
3 kG in the chromosphere. The obtained ﬁeld strengths are up to 2–3 times higher than in the numerical models and the photosphere-
to-chromosphere shear close to the polarity inversion line is more concentrated and structured.
Conclusions. In the photosphere, the assumption of LTE for Fe i line formation does not yield signiﬁcantly diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld
results compared to non-LTE, while Milne-Eddington inversions fail to reproduce the magnetic ﬁeld vector orientation where Fe i
is in emission. In the chromosphere, the non-LTE-inferred ﬁeld is excellently approximated by the spatially-regularised WFA. Our
inversions conﬁrm the locations of ﬂux rope footpoints that are predicted by numerical models. However, pre-processing and lower
spatial resolution lead to weaker and smoother ﬁeld in the models than what the data indicate. This emphasises the need for higher
spatial resolution in the models to better constrain pre-eruptive ﬂux ropes.

1. Introduction

Flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the source of the
most violent heliospheric disruptions and understanding what
triggers them is an essential piece in the space weather puz-
zle. To reliably predict either is, however, not straightforward.
Current forecasting eﬀorts build on the round-the-clock cover-
age of the Earth-facing side of the Sun by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) that provides a view
from the photosphere to the corona in the (extreme) ultravio-
let, as well as photospheric magnetic ﬁeld information from the
Fe i 6173 Å line. Such data allow for parametrisation of the pho-
tospheric ﬁeld over large regions, using properties of e.g. the
polarity inversion line (Schrijver 2007), connectivity across it
(Georgoulis & Rust 2007) and measures of the magnetic shear
or helicity (e.g. Kusano et al. 2012, Pariat et al. 2017, Zuccarello
et al. 2018) that are known to be indicators of an active region’s
eruptive potential. These have been exploited by themselves or
combined with SDO’s upper-atmosphere diagnostics to arrive at
a prediction through either statistical models or machine learning

techniques that have become increasingly popular over the past
few years (e.g. Leka & Barnes 2003, 2007, Bobra & Couvidat
2015, McCloskey et al. 2016, Florios et al. 2018, Jonas et al.
2018, Nishizuka et al. 2018, Panos & Kleint 2020).

However, this means that usually only the lower magnetic
(and/or the derived electric) ﬁeld boundary conditions are taken
into account, while the chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld vector
could signiﬁcantly aid data-driven modelling (e.g. De Rosa et al.
2009, Toriumi et al. 2020) of, for instance, the magnetic ﬁeld
structure of CMEs (Kilpua et al. 2019), which in turn is im-
portant for space weather forecasts. An important obstacle is,
however, that the necessary spectropolarimetric observations
are neither widely nor commonly acquired, and when they are
the ﬁeld-of-view is typically limited. Consequently, ﬂare stud-
ies that include chromospheric polarimetry—and do so at high
spatial resolution—are sparse (e.g. Sasso et al. 2014, Kuckein
et al. 2015, Judge et al. 2015, Kleint 2017, Kuridze et al. 2018,
Libbrecht et al. 2019, Kuridze et al. 2019).

Towards the end of the last Solar Cycle 24 NOAA active re-
gion (AR) 12673 evolved from a lonely symmetric sunspot as

it appeared when rotating into view to an active and complex
sunspot group by the time it crossed the central meridian. The
ﬂaring activity of this active region has been studied extensively
over the past two years, given that over the span of a week it pro-
duced four X-class ﬂares—including the two largest ﬂares of that
cycle (X9.3 on September 6 11:53 UT and X8.2 on September
10 15:35 UT)—over two dozen M-class ﬂares and many more
smaller ones. Moreover, the X9.3 ﬂare was preceded by a con-
ﬁned X2.2 ﬂare a mere 3 h earlier. The active region developed
as ﬂux that emerged over the course of three days next to an
α-class sunspot coalesced and led to a complex δ-spot conﬁgu-
ration, where strong shearing ﬂows along the polarity inversion
line (PIL) between the positive-polarity spot and parasitic nega-
tive polarity were the likely main agent in setting up the active
region for ﬂaring (Yang et al. 2017, Romano et al. 2018, Wang
et al. 2018b, Verma 2018).

With near-continuous coverage by the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012, Schou et al. 2012)
aboard SDO and availability of its derived data products such
as Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs; Bobra
et al. 2014), this is also an attractive target to study the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration and evolution during emergence and ﬂaring.
For instance, Hou et al. (2018) focussed on the two largest ﬂares
that the active region brought forth (i.e. the X9.3 and X8.2 ﬂares)
and used a time sequence of non-linear force free ﬁeld (NLFFF)
extrapolations to investigate the ﬁeld evolution during the ﬂares.
For both ﬂares they found a multi-ﬂux-rope conﬁguration over
the PIL wherein the ﬂux ropes were destabilised by the shearing
and rotating motions of the δ-sunspot, setting oﬀ the upper ﬂux
rope and leading to destabilisation of adjacent ﬂux ropes that
ended up erupting shortly after. Following a similar approach,
Liu et al. (2018b) used a time series of NLFFF and potential ﬁeld
models to study the conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare that preceded the X9.3
one and they also identiﬁed a multiple-branch or double-decker
magnetic ﬂux rope conﬁguration. During the conﬁned ﬂare the
magnetic helicity was found to increase by over 250% from pre-
ﬂare values and again signiﬁcantly reduced during the subse-
quent X9.3 ﬂare, implying a scenario in which the conﬁned ﬂare
set the stage for the eruptive one. Zou et al. (2019), analysing
a series of NLFFF extrapolations obtained using a magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) relaxation method, suggested a two-step
reconnection process in which reconnection ﬁrst occured in a
null point outside the magnetic ﬂux rope system and at around
4000 km height, while the associated disturbance then triggered
the second, tether-cutting reconnection. However, as the over-
lying ﬁeld was suﬃciently strong, the ﬂare remained conﬁned.
Romano et al. (2019) performed NLFFF extrapolations as well
and identiﬁed null points for the X2.2 and X9.3 ﬂares at 5000
and 3000 km above the photospheric boundary, respectively.

More elaborate modelling was performed by Inoue et al.
(2018), Jiang et al. (2018), and Price et al. (2019). The ﬁrst per-
formed a MHD simulation for which the initial magnetic con-
ﬁguration was set by a NLFFF extrapolation from a SHARP
about 20 min prior to the X2.2 ﬂare. Their results suggest that the
X2.2 ﬂare may have been associated with the rise of a small ﬂux
rope, triggered by reconnection underneath it and that the X9.3
ﬂare was likely to be the eruption of a large-scale magnetic ﬂux
rope that had been formed through reconnection between several
smaller ones in the hours leading up to the large ﬂare. Similarly,
Jiang et al. (2018), analysed a NLFFF extrapolation-initialised
MHD simulation of the X9.3 ﬂare and identiﬁed tether-cutting
reconnection as the likely trigger of the ﬂux rope eruption. On
the other hand, Price et al. (2019) performed time-dependent
magnetofrictional modelling to investigate the emergence and

2

evolution that led up the X9.3 ﬂare and associated eruption and
coronal mass ejection. As such, their simulation covers also the
preceding conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare. Feeding the model with a time
series of electric ﬁeld inversions based on the SDO/HMI vector
magnetic ﬁeld, with the magnetic ﬁeld initialised from a poten-
tial ﬁeld extrapolation, the authors report an increase in helicity
during the X2.2 ﬂare consistent with the ﬁndings of Liu et al.
(2018b) and while the magnetic ﬂux rope did not erupt out of
the simulation’s numerical domain during the X9.3 ﬂare, in con-
trast to the results by Inoue et al. (2018), both studies produce a
similar large-scale ﬁeld conﬁguration and evolution, as well as
structure of the erupting ﬂux rope.

However, a limitation of all above ﬁeld extrapolation and
modelling eﬀorts remains the lack of chromospheric magnetic
ﬁeld input. Including chromospheric ﬁeld information has been
shown to aid the NLFFF extrapolation in recovering the chro-
mospheric and coronal magnetic ﬁeld structure (Fleishman et al.
2019). Similarly, Toriumi et al. (2020) compared several data-
driven model results based on a ﬂux emergence simulation and
found that the largest errors were due to strong Lorentz forces at
the photospheric boundary inducing spurious ﬂows that altered
the magnetic ﬁeld (via the induction equation), whereas inclu-
sion of the ﬁeld at a higher, and much more force-free, layer
resulted in better agreement with the input simulation. While the
(non-magnetic) Hα response to the X9.3 ﬂare has been studied
in detail in Quinn et al. (2019), the chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld
of neither of the September 6 ﬂares has previously been investi-
gated from observations.

We take on part of that challenge in the present study and
focus on the conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare in NOAA AR 12673 for which
high-resolution observations of both photospheric and chromo-
spheric spectropolarimetry are available. Section 2 introduces
the observations and post-processing to prepare the data for in-
versions. Section 3 describes diﬀerent approaches we employed
in inferring the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld
vectors, with Section 4 presenting our results. We also compare
those against two numerical models in Section 5. We discuss our
ﬁndings in Section 6 and present our conclusions in Section 7.

2. Observations and reduction

We analyse a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare in NOAA AR 12673 on
September 6, 2017, that lasted from 08:57–09:17 UT, peaking
at 09:10 UT. Part of its rise and decay phase was observed by
the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) Stokes
Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) aboard Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007),
as well as the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP;
Scharmer et al. 2008) at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST;
Scharmer et al. 2003). Figure 1 presents an overview of these ob-
servations, along with context line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld from
a SDO/HMI-derived SHARP two minutes after the ﬂare peak.

Imaging spectropolarimetry in the Ca ii 8542 Å line was ob-
tained at the SST between 09:04:30–09:54:24 UT, sampling 11
wavelength positions out to ±0.7 Å from line centre (at 0.1 Å
spacing between ±0.3 Å and at 0.2 Å in the wings) at an overall
cadence of 15 s per scan. The pixel scale is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)058 pix−1. The data
were reduced with the CRISPRED (de la Cruz Rodr´ıguez et al.
2015) pipeline, including image restoration using Multi-Object
Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MOMFBD; van Noort et al.
2005), removal of remaining small-scale seeing-induced defor-
mations (Henriques 2012) and destretching to correct for rubber-
sheet seeing eﬀects (Shine et al. 1994).

Additional treatment of the data was necessary to increase
the signal-to-noise in Ca ii 8542 Å Stokes Q and U, and we ap-
plied the denoising neural network of D´ıaz Baso et al. (2019),
followed by Fourier-ﬁltering to suppress the strongest remain-
ing high-frequency fringe patterns (similar to the method de-
scribed in Pietrow et al. (2020)). As the seeing conditions were
variable at La Palma, we selected a single line scan snapshot at
09:09:00 UT for further study, based on best contrast throughout
the line scan and fortuitously close in time to the ﬂare peak.

Hinode SOT/SP performed a fast map of 164(cid:48)(cid:48)×164(cid:48)(cid:48) full
spectropolarimetry in Fe i 6301.5 Å and 6302.5 Å at 3.2 s inte-
gration time per slit position between 09:03:40–09:27:53 UT,
resulting in a mid raster-scan time of 09:15:47 UT. The raster
pixel size is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)32 × 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)30. For the sub-ﬁeld cutout marked by the
dashed box in Fig. 1, the mid-scan time is 09:09:14 UT, close
to the selected best-contrast frame of the SST data set and the
ﬂare peak. We did not attempt simultaneous inversion of the
Hinode and SST data, as SOT/SP required nearly 11 min to scan
the sub-ﬁeld, leading to increasingly inconsistent Fe i and Ca ii
proﬁles towards the vertical edges of the overlapping ﬁeld-of-
view. However, the SOT/SP sampling of the polarity inversion
line vicinity—which is what we are primarily interested in—
falls within 3 min of the Ca ii line scan snapshot.

2.1. Data alignment

We aligned the SST data to Hinode through cross-correlation,
using the Hinode continuum image (Fig. 1, middle panel) as an-
chor to which the Ca ii 8542 Å wide-band image was aligned.
This includes downsampling the SST data to Hinode resolution
(about a factor 5 in both x and y) as part of the alignment process.
As we are primarily interested in comparing the photospheric
and chromospheric ﬁeld in the same pixels, this is a reason-
able compromise to make and it has the added beneﬁt of saving
computational time, as well as improving the signal-to-noise ra-
tio of the polarimetric data. CRISPEX (Vissers & Rouppe van
der Voort 2012, L¨ofdahl et al. 2018) was used to verify inter-
instrument alignment and for data browsing.

product readily delivers these results and contains (among other
quantities) the ﬁeld strength value, its inclination and azimuth,
where the latter still has an unresolved 180◦-ambiguity. We dis-
cuss our disambiguation approach for this and the other inferred
azimuths in Section 3.4.

3.2. Spatially-regularised weak-ﬁeld approximation

An estimate of the chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld can be
obtained using the weak-ﬁeld approximation (WFA, Landi
Degl’Innocenti 1992, 2004), which assumes that the Zeeman
splitting is smaller than the Doppler broadening of the line in
question. This method does not bear the cost of solving the full
non-LTE radiative transfer problem and lends itself therefore
well for fast estimation of the magnetic ﬁeld over a larger ﬁeld-
of-view, but suﬀers from several simpliﬁcations and a limited
range of validity that need be borne in mind (Centeno 2018).
The WFA has found its use for targets like sunspots (de la Cruz
Rodr´ıguez et al. 2013), plage (Pietarila et al. 2007), as well as in
ﬂares (Harvey 2012, Kleint 2017).

Here we use a spatially-regularised WFA (Morosin et al.
2020)—an extension of the commonly used pixel-by-pixel
one—to infer the approximate chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration over the full SST ﬁeld-of-view. The spatially-
regularised approach departs from the idea that, when the ob-
servations are properly sampled near the diﬀraction limit of the
telescope, the derived magnetic ﬁeld should be spatially smooth
in its variation. The implementation we use employs Tikhonov
(cid:96)-2 regularisation and to impose the smoothness the values of the
four nearest-neighbours (±1 pixel in both the x- and y-direction)
are taken into account when minimising χ2. The power of this
method is that with well-chosen parameters the eﬀects of noise
can be drastically mitigated. For further details we refer the
reader to Morosin et al. (2020).

Finally, we note that the weak-ﬁeld approximation results
(including azimuth disambiguation) were obtained before down-
sampling to Hinode resolution was performed as part of the data
alignment process.

3. Methods for magnetic ﬁeld vector inference

3.3. Non-LTE inversions

Several methods exist to infer or derive the magnetic ﬁeld vector
from observations, varying in degree of complexity and com-
putational expense. In this section we discuss the three meth-
ods used in this study, with on one end Milne-Eddington inver-
sions and a spatially-regularised weak-ﬁeld approximation that
provide a ﬁeld estimate under simplifying assumptions and on
the other end (non-)LTE inversions that yield a depth-stratiﬁed
model atmosphere with temperature, velocities and magnetic
ﬁeld, albeit at higher computational cost.

3.1. Milne-Eddington inversions

As approximation of the photospheric ﬁeld we use the pixel-by-
pixel (i.e. each pixel is treated independently) Milne-Eddington
(ME) inversion results obtained with the Milne-Eddington gRid
Linear Inversion Network (MERLIN) code. These inversions are
performed assuming a source function that is linear with optical
depth, but where quantities like the magnetic ﬁeld vector and
line-of-sight velocity are otherwise constant throughout the at-
mosphere. We also note that in the routine application of the
MERLIN code a saturation limit of 5 kG is imposed on the line-
of-sight and horizontal ﬁeld strengths. The SOT/SP level-2 data

We use the STockholm Inversion Code (STiC; de la Cruz
Rodr´ıguez et al. 2016, de la Cruz Rodr´ıguez et al. 2019) to in-
fer the atmospheric stratiﬁcation of temperature, velocities and
magnetic ﬁeld from the Hinode Fe i and SST Ca ii data. STiC
is an MPI-parallel non-LTE inversion code built around a modi-
ﬁed version of RH (Uitenbroek 2001) to solve the atom popula-
tion densities assuming statistical equilibrium and plane-parallel
geometry, using an equation of state extracted from the SME
code (Piskunov & Valenti 2017). We assumed complete fre-
quency redistribution (CRD) in our inversions. The radiative
transport equation is solved using cubic Bezier solvers (de la
Cruz Rodr´ıguez & Piskunov 2013). As the Hinode SOT/SP scan-
ning time was too long to obtain consistent Fe i and Ca ii proﬁles
for the overlapping part of the ﬁeld-of-view, we decided to per-
form the inversions for both lines separately and could therefore
not take advantage of the multi-resolution inversion technique
recently proposed by de la Cruz Rodr´ıguez (2019).

The Ca ii inversions were performed in non-LTE using a 6-
level calcium model atom and assuming CRD. For Fe i we per-
formed both LTE and non-LTE inversions, spurred in part by the
recent study by Smitha et al. (2020). They report on LTE inver-
sions of Fe i 6301 Å and 6302 Å that were synthesised assuming

ﬁrst two panels outlines the cut-out of Fig. 2. The cyan contours in the middle panel indicate locations where the Fe i lines are in

either LTE or non-LTE and that indicate that LTE inversions of
non-LTE Fe i may result in discrepancies with the input model in
terms of temperature (of order 10%) and line-of-sight velocities
and magnetic ﬁeld (both up to 50%), while the ﬁeld inclination
could exhibit errors of up to 45◦. For both the LTE and non-LTE
Fe i inversions we used the same extended 23-level Fe i atom that
has been used in several studies on the non-LTE radiative trans-
fer eﬀects in the Fe i lines over the past decade (Holzreuter &
Solanki 2013, 2015, Smitha et al. 2020).

As initial input atmosphere we used a FAL-C model inter-
polated to a ∆log τ500 = 0.2 grid between log τ500 = −8.5 and
0.1, but truncated at log τ500 = −5 (i.e. excluding the upper at-
mosphere) for Fe i given the lack of sensitivity of the line to con-
ditions much above the temperature minimum. Both the Fe i and
Ca ii inversions were performed in two cycles with spatial and
depth smoothing of the model atmosphere between the ﬁrst and
second cycle, as well as an increased number of nodes in tem-
perature, velocity and magnetic ﬁeld component in the second
cycle (see Table 1). In addition, as the ﬂaring emission proﬁles
in both Fe i and Ca ii proved a challenge for the ﬁrst cycle in-
versions, we replaced the atmospheres of the worst ﬁtted pixels
(as expressed by their χ2-value) with the average atmosphere of
nearby well-ﬁtted pixels with same-sign line-of-sight ﬁeld prior
to smoothing for the second cycle input. The results of these in-
versions are presented in Section 4.

3.4. Azimuth disambigution

The photospheric and chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld azimuth
ϕ recovered from both the Milne-Eddington inversions, the
weak-ﬁeld approximation and STiC inversions contain a 180◦-
ambiguity that needs to be resolved for proper interpretation of
the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld component. Several schemes exist
for this disambiguation (Metcalf et al. 2006); here we use the
implementation by Leka et al. (2014) of the minimum energy
method (MEM) proposed by Metcalf (1994), that simultane-
ously minimises the divergence of the ﬁeld and the current den-
sity. This method works well for photospheric lines, where the
linear polarisation signal is suﬃciently strong, but the method
typically struggles for Ca ii 8542 Å where the Stokes Q and U
proﬁles are noisier. Above the sunspot and during the ﬂare, how-
ever, the linear polarisation signal is suﬃciently strong that the
azimuth can be reliably recovered in the chromosphere. In order
to check what areas of the FOV are uncertain for the ambigu-
ity resolution, we ran the MEM code with twenty diﬀerent ran-
dom number seeds. Regions where the azimuth result changed
by more than 45◦ between runs were considered to be unstable
for disambiguation and for those pixels we set the azimuth by
majority vote of the results from the twenty realisations.

4.1. LTE versus non-LTE inversions of Fe i

Figures 2–4 compare the results from the STiC LTE and non-
LTE inversions of the Fe i 6301.5 Å and 6302.5 Å spectra.
Figure 2 shows the photospheric line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld
with arrows indicating the magnetic ﬁeld azimuth where their
hue reﬂects the horizontal ﬁeld strength (i.e. darker blue be-
ing stronger). Qualitatively, the LTE and non-LTE inversions
of Fe i yield very similar magnetic ﬁeld distributions, espe-
cially at log τ500 = −0.5 and −1.1. Also the ﬁeld azimuth
shows largely the same pattern, as does to a certain extent
the strong horizontal ﬁeld distribution (bright green contours
for Bhor > 5 kG). Where the ﬁeld is weak (both line-of-sight
and horizontal, e.g. in the top left part of the ﬁeld-of-view)

with both line-of-sight and horizontal ﬁeld strengths clipped to the the range wherein 98% of the pixels fall. Bright green contours
indicate where the horizontal ﬁeld is in excess of 5 kG, while the cyan contours in the ﬁrst column highlight where the Fe i lines are
in emission. The coloured plus signs mark the locations for which (non-)LTE proﬁle ﬁts are shown in Fig. 4.

the azimuth displays apparently random orientations, contrast-
ing with the more ordered pattern in the strong-ﬁeld sunspot
umbra and penumbra, even though the distinct ‘whirlpool’-like
pattern in the ‘head’ of the inverse-S shaped polarity inversion
line (i.e. around (X, Y) = (510(cid:48)(cid:48), −235(cid:48)(cid:48))) is only recovered with
the non-LTE inversions. Regardless of LTE or non-LTE, the az-

imuth is essentially parallel to the PIL in its vicinity, except in
the positive-polarity umbra around (X, Y) = (515(cid:48)(cid:48), −245(cid:48)(cid:48)). The
largest diﬀerences are primarily found at and close to the lo-
cations where the Fe i lines go into emission, highlighted by
the cyan contours in the ﬁrst column. While both inversions
yield negative polarity in the cyan-outlined ‘head’ of the inverse-

sists at all three shown log τ500-depths for the LTE inversion
(albeit no longer as smoothly at log τ500 = −2.1), while for
the non-LTE inversion opposite polarity starts appearing around
(X, Y) = (515(cid:48)(cid:48), −255(cid:48)(cid:48)) at log τ500 = −1.1 and −2.1.

Figure 3 quantiﬁes this behaviour through two-dimensional
histograms of the line-of-sight and horizontal ﬁeld, as well as the
temperatures for pixels where Fe i is in emission. As the mag-
netic ﬁeld scatter plots (top two rows) show, the correlation is
overall positive for Blos and Bhor and relatively tight for the for-
mer, especially around log τ500 = −1.1, even though there is a
cloud of points at negative Blos,NLTE and positive Blos,LTE at all
three log τ500-depths. Upon closer inspection, these turn out to
be scattered pixels in the emission patches around Y = −250(cid:48)(cid:48)
for which negative Blos was inferred in non-LTE. These panels
also evidence that, while in general neither Blos nor Bhor ex-
ceed 3 kG by much (cf. also the colour bars in Fig. 2, clipped
to the range wherein 98% of the pixels fall), there are pix-
els where values of 4–6 kG are reached for either ﬁeld compo-
nent. Many pixels are also inverted with somewhat lower line-

of-sight ﬁeld strength in LTE than in non-LTE (cf. the scatter
clouds above the diagonal line at negative Blos,NLTE and below
at positive Blos,NLTE for log τ500 = −0.5 and −1.1). The oppo-
site appears true at log τ500 = −2.1 (top right panel). The me-
dian fractional diﬀerence (Blos,NLTE − Blos,LTE)/Blos,LTE reaches
up to 6.7% at log τ500 = −0.5, but decreases to −2.1% at
log τ500 = −2.1, while for the full ﬁeld-of-view it peaks to 9.1%
at log τ500 = −1.1. On the other hand, for the horizontal ﬁeld the
LTE-inferred Bhor is typically stronger than in the non-LTE in-
version, in particular at low and middle log τ500-depths (median
fractional diﬀerence of around −7%), while at log τ500 = −2.1
pixels can be found above 4 kG in non-LTE that barely reach that
value in the LTE inversion.

The discrepancies are even larger for temperature (bottom
row of Fig. 3), with strong correlation between LTE and non-
LTE-inferred temperatures at log τ500 = −0.5, but an increas-
ingly loose scatter higher in the atmosphere at log τ500 = −1.5
and especially −2.1. At those heights fewer and fewer pixels
lie on the diagonal and there is a clear tendency for higher
temperatures in non-LTE, inferring some 7–8 kK versus 4–5 kK

in LTE. The median non-LTE-to-LTE fractional diﬀerence in-
creases from 1.5% at log τ500 = −0.5 to nearly 25% at log τ500 =
−2.1 for the ﬂaring pixels. For the full ﬁeld-of-view that diﬀer-
ence reaches 5.6% at the same height.

Finally, Fig. 4 presents several examples of observed proﬁles
and LTE and non-LTE ﬁts to those, one from a magnetic con-
centration outside the sunspot and four from the (vicinity of the)
ﬂare. Striking for some of the latter is the evident Zeeman split-
ting in Fe i 6302.5 Å Stokes I, suggesting strong magnetic ﬁelds.
As these panels show, we ﬁnd only very minor diﬀerences be-
tween the LTE and non-LTE ﬁts, regardless of the proﬁle shape.
In the “quiet Sun” sampling (ﬁrst column) the 6301.5 Å Stokes
Q is better ﬁtted in LTE, while the non-LTE ﬁt to 6302.5 Å gets
closer to the observations. The PIL-sampling (second column)
is similarly ﬁtted in either approach, but it is in fact possible to
ﬁt the ﬂaring emission proﬁles (last three columns) even in LTE,
with little diﬀerence compared to non-LTE. Especially Stokes V
is well-ﬁtted in these cases and both LTE and non-LTE some-
times struggle in reaching the extrema (e.g. 6302.5 Å Stokes U
in the middle sampling (orange) or 6301.5 Å Stokes Q in the last
(blue) one). Either way, the outer wings of the Fe i lines in Stokes
I generally prove to be challenging to ﬁt simultaneously with the
emission peaks, where the LTE ﬁt is marginally closer (yet still
not close) to the observations.

4.2. Milne-Eddington and weak-ﬁeld approximation versus

non-LTE inversions

Photospheric ﬁeld Figure 5 compares the Milne-Eddington
photospheric and weak-ﬁeld approximation chromospheric
ﬁelds (left panels (a) and (d)) with their equivalents from non-
LTE inversions (middle panels (b) and (e)). Let us ﬁrst consider
the photospheric ﬁeld (bottom panels (d) and (e)). A limitation
inherent to the Milne-Eddington inversions is that a linear source
function cannot simultaneously explain absorption and emis-

sion features. Considering that where the Fe i cores are in emis-
sion the wings generally exhibit absorption dips (cf. Fig. 4), the
Milne-Eddington inversion will likely ﬁt the wings under the as-
sumption that the polarity reversal in Stokes V is due to a change
in the sign of the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld, rather than a
change in slope of the source function. This explains the evident
discrepancy in line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld where the Fe i lines
are in emission (black contours). While the Milne-Eddington in-
version returns an embedded opposite polarity in those areas,
the non-LTE inversion yields same-sign line-of-sight ﬁeld that
corresponds to the dominant polarity in either umbra of the δ-
spot. Similarly, this likely explains the discrepancy in azimuth
direction for those pixels. Finally, the previously noted MERLIN
saturation limit of 5 kG means that the strong line-of-sight and
horizontal ﬁeld that were inferred in both the LTE and non-LTE
inversions (see Figs. 2 and 3) cannot be reproduced with the
Milne-Eddington approach, where the line-of-sight ﬁeld ranges
from −3.6 kG to saturation at +5 kG, also reaching saturation for
the horizontal ﬁeld.

Chromospheric ﬁeld As the non-LTE inversions yield a depth-
stratiﬁed atmosphere, we investigate the response of the Ca ii
Stokes proﬁles to magnetic ﬁeld changes and ﬁnd that this re-
sponse peaks somewhere between log τ500 = −2.7 and −4.3 de-
pending on the pixel in question. We therefore decide to average
the magnetic ﬁeld components over seven depth points centered
at log τ500 = −3.5, eﬀectively covering log τ500 = [−2.9, −4.1].
The chromospheric line-of-sight ﬁeld maps from the weak-
ﬁeld approximation (Fig. 5a) and non-LTE inversions (Fig. 5b)
are largely the same, both in the distribution of opposite polari-
ties and in the strengths that they reach. The evident exception is
a band of positive polarity around (X, Y) = (500(cid:48)(cid:48), −250(cid:48)(cid:48)) in the
non-LTE results, where the solution may have converged to a lo-
cal minimum and failed to ﬁt all four Stokes parameters as well
as outside this band. In addition, the non-LTE inversion exhibits

stronger ﬁeld both below and above the ‘head’ of the inverse-S
polarity inversion line, compared to the WFA map. The latter is
naturally smoother given the spatial regularisation that couples
the solution from neighbouring pixels.

Considering then the horizontal ﬁeld (green arrows) from
the spatially-regularised weak-ﬁeld approximation (Fig. 5a) and
non-LTE-inferred results (Fig. 5b), and comparing with that in
the photosphere, we ﬁnd that in both cases for most of the pos-

itive polarity (right of X = 510(cid:48)(cid:48)) and part of the negative po-
larity (between X = 510(cid:48)(cid:48) and 515(cid:48)(cid:48)) the photospheric and chro-
mospheric ﬁeld azimuth point in nearly the same direction. The
discrepancies are larger in the top left of the SST ﬁeld-of-view
(black box in the lower panels)—unsurprisingly, as the ﬁeld is
weaker there—but also close to the polarity inversion line for the
ME–WFA comparison, while the non-LTE-inferred azimuths are
in closer agreement between photosphere and chromosphere.

and Bhor averaged over log τ500 = [−2.9, −4.1].

Comparing the chromospheric ﬁeld from the WFA and non-
LTE inversions we also see that in both the horizontal component
has a similar orientation in the vicinity of the polarity inversion
line and in strong line-of-sight ﬁeld areas in general. This simi-
larity holds also for the three-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld vector,
as visualised in Fig. 5c, mapping the angle diﬀerence θ between
the non-LTE-inferred and WFA-derived magnetic ﬁeld vectors.
This angle θ is obtained simply as

θ(B1, B2) = arccos



B1 · B2
|B1||B2|



where in this case B1 = BWFA and B2 = BSTiC. Over the full
ﬁeld-of-view more than 75% of the pixels have an angle of 55◦
or less, but this statistic is in part driven by the large angle diﬀer-
ences that are found in weak-ﬁeld regions (top left corner) where
derivation of the azimuth is not as reliable. In the strong-ﬁeld
parts of the ﬁeld-of-view θ < 15◦ in general, with the exception
of the band of large θ around (X, Y) = (500(cid:48)(cid:48), −250(cid:48)(cid:48)), where the
non-LTE inversion (erroneously) returns a positive Blos value.

Figure 6 quantiﬁes the degree of similarity ﬁeld further and
presents two-dimensional histograms for the line-of-sight and
horizontal ﬁeld compontens, as well as the distributions of the
angle θ between the two three-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld vec-
tors and the ﬁeld inclination as derived with either method. In all
three panels results are shown for those pixels for which the total
WFA magnetic ﬁeld strength (|BWFA|) exceeds 2 kG (white con-
tours in Fig. 5c). From the left-hand and middle panels we see
that the WFA line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld strength is strongly
correlated with that from the non-LTE inversions, but that the
horizontal ﬁeld strength presents a wide scatter cloud. About
45% of the selected pixels have a stronger line-of-sight com-
ponent in the non-LTE inversions than in the WFA, but slightly
more than half have a higher horizontal ﬁeld (53%) and total
ﬁeld (54%) strength when inferred with STiC. The median non-
LTE-to-WFA fractional diﬀerence is only a few percent for ei-
ther component: 1.2% for Blos, 3.0% for Bhor and 2.0% for Btot.
In addition, a few features stand out. First, the line-of-sight panel
indicates a higher density on the diagonal at roughly ±2 kG, but
these disappear when taking all pixels into account and they

are therefore a visualisation artefact from excluding pixels with
|BWFA| < 2 kG. Second, the roughly horizontal scatter around
Blos,WFA = −2 kG and extending over all positive Blos,STiC values
is due to pixels that have erroneously been inferred with posi-
tive line-of-sight ﬁeld strengths in the latter (cf. Fig. 5b and the
aforementioned band of large θ around (X, Y) = (500(cid:48)(cid:48), −250(cid:48)(cid:48))
in Fig. 5c).

The right-hand panel shows that the distribution of angles θ
between the three-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld vectors (solid blue
line) is skewed to smaller angles. The distribution has a median
of 8◦ and over 91% of the pixels have an angle between the WFA
and non-LTE-inferred magnetic ﬁeld vectors of 25◦ or less. Only
4% of the pixels has an angle larger than 50◦ (i.e. outside the
panel’s range). The absolute diﬀerence between the WFA- and
non-LTE-inferred ﬁeld inclinations (|γWFA − γSTiC|, dashed red
line) is equally skewed, with a median of 5◦ and over 90% of the
pixels with an inclination diﬀerence of less than 15◦. Hence, al-
though the horizontal ﬁeld strengths are not as tightly correlated,
the per-pixel magnetic ﬁeld orientiation is very similar between
WFA and non-LTE inversion.

Finally, Fig. 7 presents a selection of Ca ii 8542 Å proﬁle ﬁts
for the coloured markers in Fig. 5b. The ﬁrst column samples
a pixel in the positive-polarity umbra, while the other four are
of pixels in the Ca ii ﬂare ribbons, where the last two are for the
same red and blue pixels as in Fig. 4. The complex umbral proﬁle
(cyan) is well-ﬁtted in all four Stokes components, except for a
spurious local maximum in Stokes Q. Overall, the ﬁts to Stokes
I and V follow the observations closely regardless of the intensi-
ties and proﬁle shapes, while Stokes Q and U sometimes prove
more diﬃcult (e.g. purple and blue samplings, in particular the
blue Stokes U), despite the high signal-to-noise ratio. Systematic
errors (e.g. calibration errors due to remaining fringes or variable
seeing) in combination with a typically weaker signal compared
to Stokes V are likely culprits for such occasionally poorer ﬁts
to Stokes Q and/or U. The stronger horizontal chromospheric
ﬁelds are in general only inferred when Stokes Q and U are both
well-recovered (e.g. orange and red samplings). In some cases
(e.g. blue) the strong line-of-sight ﬁeld leads to visibly Zeeman-
splitted Stokes V lobes.

Magnetic ﬁeld strengths While most of the ﬁeld-of-view is in-
ferred with relatively common ﬁeld strengths of up 2–3 kG in
both photosphere and slightly lower in the chromosphere (cf. the
colour bars in Figs. 2 and 5), certain pixels are inferred with val-
ues well in excess of that. These are typically found for ﬂaring
proﬁles in Fe i and Ca ii and some examples are given in Fig. 4
(last three columns) where |Btot| (cid:39) 5.5 − 6 kG in the photosphere.
However, the contours in the middle panels of Fig. 5—outlining
places where the photospheric ﬁeld exceeds 4.5 kG and the chro-
mospheric ﬁeld 3 kG in Blos (cyan) and the same thresholds in
Bhor (green)—show that these are typically not isolated pixels.
Moreover, while these are somewhat arbitrary thresholds, chang-
ing their values does not change that this strong ﬁeld is gener-
ally clustered in coherent patches that persist from photosphere
to chromosphere.

5. Comparison with numerical models

We compare our magnetic ﬁeld inference results with those from
two numerical simulations, namely the magnetofrictional (MF)
model from Price et al. (2019) (see also details in Pomoell et al.
2019) that was driven time-dependently with the inferred electric
ﬁeld (Lumme et al. 2017) from HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld data,

10

and the magnetohydrodynamic model by Inoue et al. (2018) that
was initialised on a NLFFF extrapolation of the HMI photo-
spheric ﬁeld at 08:36 UT. For the former we consider the model
snapshot at 09:24 UT, which is the one closest in time to the
X2.2 ﬂare peak, while for the latter we take the model snapshot
at t = 0.28 h, equivalent to 08:52:48 UT (just four minutes be-
fore the X2.2 ﬂare). This choice is constrained by the cadence of
the respective simulations and our aim to compare with the ob-
servationally inferred ﬁeld. We furthermore note that selecting a
diﬀerent snapshot from the magnetofrictional model would not
signiﬁcantly alter our comparison or conclusions, given the tem-
poral smoothing applied in its pre-processing (see discussion in
Section 6.4).

For both we take the photospheric ﬁeld from the z = 0 Mm
height, while we consider the average Ca ii 8542 Å formation
height in our ﬁeld-of-view to be between 1–2 Mm (cf. e.g.
Bjørgen et al. 2019) and select the only height index that falls in
that range in both simulations, resulting in z = 1.75 Mm for the
MF model and z = 1.44 Mm for the MHD model. This choice is
again a limitation imposed by the model properties, but we note
that taking the chromospheric ﬁeld as coming from one height
index higher does not signiﬁcantly change the presented maps
and that our choice also minimises the height diﬀerence between
the respective model slices. Furthermore, the MHD model is not
data-driven and does not aim to exactly reproduce the temporal
evolution of the observed events. We therefore selected an al-
ready analysed snapshot (cf. Inoue et al. 2018) where the ﬂux
ropes still sit low in the atmosphere, as our observations also
suggest.

5.1. Inferred versus modelled magnetic ﬁeld

Figure 8 presents a comparison of the non-LTE-inferred photo-
spheric and chromospheric ﬁeld vector with that from the two
numerical models. The top row shows ﬁeld vector maps, while
the bottom row shows maps of the angle θ (cf. Eq. (1)) be-
tween the three-dimensional photospheric and chromospheric
ﬁeld vectors for the same three cut-outs.

The top middle and right-hand panels (i.e. models) are rela-
tively similar between each other, yet diﬀer considerably in sev-
eral aspects from the left-hand panel (i.e. inferred ﬁeld). The
overall distribution of positive and negative line-of-sight polari-
ties is similar between all three panels, but where the non-LTE
inference of the magnetic ﬁeld yields absolute line-of-sight ﬁeld
strengths in excess of 4 kG in both photosphere and chromo-
sphere in certain places, the simulations do not reach beyond
2.4 kG in the photosphere and 1.3 kG in the chromosphere any-
where. Similarly for the horizontal ﬁeld, the inferred values of
up to 5 kG in the photosphere and 4.6 kG in the chromosphere
are 2–3 times larger than the maxima in the simulations. This
is likely a combined eﬀect of the pixel size diﬀerence between
HMI and Hinode data, as well as the fact that the Hinode data
sample two spectral lines with diﬀerent Land´e factors at high
spectral resolution, leading to weaker ﬁeld from HMI and con-
sequently lower values in the models that are based on that.

While more than half an hour apart, the two modelling re-
sults generally exhibit the same line-of-sight ﬁeld distribution
reaching also similar strengths (both between about ±2 kG in the
photosphere and ±1.3 kG in the chromosphere, though slightly
stronger in the MF model). The MF model also has more ex-
tended strong-ﬁeld concentrations than the MHD model. Even
larger diﬀerences are found in the horizontal ﬁeld strengths and
especially in the azimuth pattern. Discrepancies in the latter are

G. J. M. Vissers et. al.: Non-LTE inversions of a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare: I. Vector magnetic ﬁeld

evident close to the polarity inversion line, where the ﬁeld in
the MF model (middle panel) is oriented at a larger angle to
the polarity inversion line, while that of the MHD model (right
panel) follows the inverse-S shape more closely. Also, the ap-
parent source point of diverging positive ﬁeld in the MF model
(at (x, y) = (−12 Mm, 0 Mm) in the middle panel) lies some 6–
7 Mm towards the North-West (i.e. upper right) in the MHD
model (at (x, y) = (100 Mm, 74 Mm) in the right panel), while
the ‘whirlpool’-like convergence to negative line-of-sight ﬁeld
in the head of the inverse-S is similar in both, though stronger in
the MHD results.

In strong line-of-sight ﬁeld regions the photospheric and
chromospheric azimuths are similar between the non-LTE infer-
ence and the models, whereas in weaker-ﬁeld areas the inferred
azimuth appears more random. For all three panels, the photo-
spheric and chromospheric azimuths are often similar, but the
inferred azimuths show typically the largest angles between the
photosphere and chromosphere—in particular in and close to the
strong ﬁeld regions in the vicinity of the inverse-S shaped polar-
ity inversion line. Overall, and considering the strong-ﬁeld part
of the ﬁeld-of-view in particular, the inferred azimuths are best
approached by those from the MHD model.

5.2. Photosphere-to-chromosphere ﬁeld vector variation

The smoothness in change of the ﬁeld vector orientation from
photosphere to chromosphere in the models compared to the
inversions is further emphasised in the bottom row of Fig. 8,
showing maps of the angle θ(Bphot, Bchro) between the 3D pho-
tospheric and chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld vectors. For most of
the strong-ﬁeld regions of the ﬁeld-of-view the angle between
the inferred ﬁeld vectors is relatively small (below 50◦), while
strong deviations are found outside the sunspot penumbra (above
the upper polarity inversion line, marked by the dashed white
line). Here the total ﬁeld strength in both photosphere and chro-
mosphere is small and the azimuth consequently diﬃcult to dis-
ambiguate, resulting in θ displaying a confetti-coloured random-
ness. In the models most of the ﬁeld-of-view has relatively shal-
low angles between the photospheric and chromospheric ﬁeld.
Apart from the resolution and timing diﬀerence, both models
tend to have the enhancements in θ in similar places, although at
often larger magnitude in the MHD model (e.g. the large patch
of θ (cid:39) 50 − 100◦ around (x, y) = (94 Mm, 104 Mm)) and some-
times lacking a clear counterpart in the MF model (e.g. the band
of θ (cid:39) 40 − 50◦ around (x, y) = (80 Mm, 75 Mm)). What stands
out in all three panels is the arched head of the inverse-S shape,
which shows angle diﬀerences between photosphere and chro-
mosphere of at least about 50–65◦ in the models and of 50–140◦
from the observations. In the inferred ﬁeld these enhanced an-
gle diﬀerences are found along most of the spine of the inverse-
S (right of the dashed white line), where the MF model ex-
hibits only a haze of 20–30◦ and the MHD model shows only
a few localised enhancements of 30–50◦. Also, while the ob-
servations have the entire inverse-S head light up in enhanced
angles, the MF model is enhanced mostly in the eastern half (i.e.
towards the left), while the MHD model has enhancements both
at about (x, y) = (88 Mm, 92 Mm) and (x, y) = (97 Mm, 93 Mm),
with smaller angles in between.

6. Discussion

6.1. Magnetic ﬁeld approximations

Both the Milne-Eddington and spatially-regularised weak-ﬁeld
approximation oﬀer a computationally inexpensive way of ob-
taining the magnetic ﬁeld vector from observations, compared
to full-blown non-LTE inversions. At the same time, they come
with limitations, as we also see in this study. In particular the
Fe i Milne-Eddington inversion suﬀers from issues in locations
where the Fe i lines are in emission, recovering the wrong sign
for the line-of-sight polarity (cf. Fig. 2) due to the linear source
function assumed in the model. Unsurprisingly, these locations
correspond well with those areas where white light ﬂare emis-
sion in the HMI pseudocontinuum (obtained in the vicinity of
Fe i 6173 Å) has been reported in previous studies (e.g. Fig. 5 in
Romano et al. 2019 or Fig. 2 in Verma 2018). Furthermore, com-
parison with (non-)LTE inversions reveals that the default 5 kG
saturation limit imposed on the MERLIN Milne-Eddington line-
of-sight and horizontal ﬁeld may be too stringent here—a limita-
tion previously noted also in non-ﬂaring sunspots (e.g. Okamoto
& Sakurai 2018)—and this could play a role in general in ﬂares
that occur in similarly complex conﬁgurations.

On the other hand, and despite the relatively coarse sampling
of the Ca ii 8542 Å line, the spatially-regularised weak-ﬁeld ap-
proximation does a good job at recovering a magnetic ﬁeld vec-
tor that is very similar to that obtained from non-LTE inversions
(cf. Fig. 6). Over 90% of the pixels have the non-LTE and WFA
inclinations within 15◦ and their 3D ﬁeld vectors within 25◦ of
each other. The line-of-sight component in particular is close to
the non-LTE-inferred value in strong-ﬁeld areas, while the trans-
verse ﬁeld exhibits a much larger scatter. This gets worse outside
the sunspot, where the line-of-sight ﬁeld is weak and the ﬁeld
vector more horizontal, complicating retrieval of the transverse
component (as Centeno (2018) already points out), even though
the spatial constraint strongly mitigates the adverse eﬀects of
noise (Morosin et al. 2020). More than half of the strong-ﬁeld
pixels have a stronger horizontal and total ﬁeld strength in the
non-LTE inversions, while slightly less than half do so for the
line-of-sight ﬁeld.

6.2. Do we need non-LTE inversions of Fe i?

Several studies over the past 50 years have investigated the
eﬀects of assuming LTE versus non-LTE in the formation of
the Fe i lines (e.g. Athay & Lites 1972, Lites 1973, Rutten &
Kostik 1982, Rutten 1988, Shchukina & Trujillo Bueno 2001,
Holzreuter & Solanki 2012, 2013, 2015). Of particular interest
for the present study are the eﬀects on magnetic ﬁeld strength
and inclination that are reported by Smitha et al. (2020) when
inverting in LTE either LTE or non-LTE synthesised Fe i pro-
ﬁles. Hence, a natural course was to explore such eﬀects for the
data that we analysed.

Qualitatively the diﬀerences in the inferred magnetic ﬁeld
components are minor when considering our LTE and non-LTE
Fe i inversion results (cf. Fig. 2). Although there are obvious per-
pixel diﬀerences, a similar map of positive and negative line-of-
sight polarities is found for both and the locations of stronger
horizontal ﬁeld coincide well between the two inversion ap-
proaches. The latter is supported quantitatively by the typically
tighter correlation between LTE and non-LTE results for hori-
zontal ﬁeld strengths above ∼4.5 kG compared to those below
(Fig. 3, second row). The largest diﬀerences are found in the
inferred temperatures (Fig. 3, last row) and ﬁeld azimuth, with

typically higher temperatures by 500–1500 K in the non-LTE re-
sults and a spatially smoother counter-clockwise azimuth pattern
in the negative Blos polarity (i.e. the ‘head’ of the inverse-S) com-
pared to the LTE inversions. One reason for this could be that
the temperature increase required to ﬁt the Fe i emission lines is
larger in non-LTE than in LTE and if the placement of such tem-
perature gradient is limited by the node description, this could

lead to a discrepancy in the magnetic ﬁeld as a result of a diﬀer-
ence in the shape of the source function.

Nonetheless, as far as the magnetic ﬁeld is concerned there is
no strong indication that would favour non-LTE over LTE inver-
sions of Fe i, while for temperatures the diﬀerences can be sig-
niﬁcant, in particular at optical depths log τ500 = −1 and higher
up in the atmosphere. Whether this is worth a factor ∼2 increase

in computational cost to perform non-LTE inversions will thus
depend on the particular scientiﬁc objective.

6.3. Photospheric and chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld

Field strengths In certain parts of the ﬁeld-of-view the (non-
)LTE inversions with STiC yield stronger ﬁeld than the Milne-
Eddington inversion and weak-ﬁeld approximation, with values
that are on the high end of (and for the chromospheric ﬁeld
much larger than) what has generally been reported, even for
sunspots. For instance, the survey study by Livingston et al.
(2006), analysing nearly 90 years worth of sunspot observations,
emphasises this by ﬁnding a mere 0.2% of the sunspot group
sample containing sunspots with photospheric ﬁeld strengths in
excess 4 kG, only one case of which at 6.1 kG. At the same time,
several recent studies have reported strong ﬁelds in sunspots.
Okamoto & Sakurai (2018), using a Milne-Eddington inver-
sion, ﬁnd ﬁeld strengths of over 5–6 kG between two opposite-
polarity umbrae, with the 6302.5 Å Stokes I proﬁle exhibit-
ing clear Zeeman splitting. Field strengths of over 7 kG have
been inferred by van Noort et al. (2013) and Siu-Tapia et al.
(2019) from Fe i 6302 Å observations of sunspot penumbrae at
locations that are associated with strong downﬂows and where
the consequent evacuation may explain the large ﬁeld strengths
as probing sub-log τ500 = 0 heights. Castellanos Dur´an et al.
(2020), employing a similar inversion approach on a sunspot
lightbridge, ﬁnd ﬁeld in excess of 5 kG at all inversion nodes
and even up to 8.25 kG at log τ500 = 0.

In ﬂares, most photospheric ﬁeld strengths have typically
been derived from SDO/HMI data. For instance, Sun et al.
(2012) and Wang et al. (2012) investigated the same X2.2 ﬂare
and reported Bhor and Blos with values of 1.5 kG to over 2 kG,
while Sadykov et al. (2016) studied an M1.0 ﬂare with underly-
ing absolute line-of-sight ﬁeld strengths of up to 3 kG. A C4.1
ﬂare analysed by Guglielmino et al. (2016) occurred in a δ-spot
with line-of-sight ﬁeld up to about 1.5–2.0 kG, derived from
both HMI and SST/CRISP Fe i 6301.5 Å data. Similar values
have been reported from ground-based observations, e.g. based
on LTE inversions of Si i 10827 Å Kuckein et al. (2015) found
total ﬁeld strengths of order 1–2 kG in an M3.2 ﬂare, while
G¨om¨ory et al. (2017) performed LTE inversion of Fe i 10783 Å
and Si i 10786 Å, yielding Blos and Bhor of the order of 1.0–
1.5 kG during an M1.8 ﬂare in a δ-spot conﬁguration. Liu et al.
(2018a) reported Bhor of 0.2–1.0 kG and —Blos— of 1.5–2.5 kG
in an M6.5 ﬂare observed in Fe i 15648 Å. On the other hand,
chromospheric ﬁeld inferences in ﬂares or ﬁlament eruptions are
scarce and typically report values of a 0.3–2 kG and rarely more,
e.g. Sasso et al. (2014) with a few hundred Gauss in a activated
ﬁlament during a ﬂare observed in He i 10830 Å, Kleint (2017)
and Kuridze et al. (2018) with ∼1.5 kG from Ca ii 8542 Å obser-
vations of an X1 and M1.9 ﬂare, respectively, Libbrecht et al.
(2019) with ∼2.5 kG from He i D3 observations of a C3.6 ﬂare,
or Kuckein et al. (2020) with up to 60 G line-of-sight and up
to 250 G horizontal ﬁeld from He i 10830 Å observations of an
erupting ﬁlament.

For the particular active region under scrutiny here, Jurˇc´ak
et al. (2018) report ﬁeld strengths of order 2.5 kG from LTE
inversions both during and after the X9.3 ﬂare that followed
the X2.2 ﬂare, while Wang et al. (2018a) ﬁnd transverse pho-
tospheric ﬁeld of over 5.5 kG at the PIL from direct measure-
ment of the Zeeman splitting in Fe i 15648 Å GST spectra, a few
hours after the X9.3 ﬂare. In addition, Anﬁnogentov et al. (2019)

report exceptionally strong, kilogauss-order coronal magnetic
ﬁelds about 5.5 h prior to the X2.2 ﬂare based on a NLFFF re-
construction that is able to reproduce the gyroresonant emission
observed with the Nobeyama Radio Heliograph. Noteworthy is
that their results support the ∼5.5 kG ﬁeld strengths reported by
Wang et al. (2018a) and indicate ﬁeld strenghts of order 3.5–
3.0 kG at 1–3 Mm heights. In this context it is therefore perhaps
not surprising that we ﬁnd places where the horizontal and line-
of-sight ﬁeld strengths reach order 5–6 kG in the photosphere
and 3–4 kG in the chromosphere.

Given the exceptionally strong ﬁeld that our inversions
recovered, we also considered a potential degeneracy be-
tween ﬁeld strength and micro-turbulence. Fitting a turbulence-
broadened proﬁle might cause the inversion code to settle on a
high magnetic ﬁeld with low micro-turbulence, while observa-
tions in the ultraviolet have been found consistent with the pres-
ence of micro-turbulence in the chromosphere during (the onset
of) ﬂares at sites of both chromospheric evaporation and conden-
sation (e.g. Milligan 2011, Harra et al. 2013, Jeﬀrey et al. 2018,
Graham et al. 2020). However, where these strongest ﬁeld values
are inferred in the photosphere, the Zeeman splitting is often ev-
ident even in Stokes I (Fig. 4) and the individual components are
narrow, arguing against non-resolved motions. Moreover, these
pixels are largely found in coherent patches that are co-located
with similarly coherent strong-ﬁeld patches in the chromosphere
(Fig. 5b and e) and we therefore trust the values inferred for both
photosphere and chromosphere.

Height-dependent ﬁeld vector The non-LTE inversions of Fe i
and Ca ii provide photospheric and chromospheric ﬁeld vectors
and allow, for the ﬁrst time, to track from observations the ori-
entation of the magnetic ﬁeld vector with height in an X-class
ﬂare. In particular the chromospheric ﬁeld azimuth, which de-
rives from Stokes Q and U that are often plagued by noise in
the chromosphere, is notoriously challenging to obtain even in
ﬂares and consequently few have tried (Libbrecht et al. 2019).
In the case of AR 12673 we beneﬁt from the strong signal in
these Stokes components as a result of the underlying sunspot,
which enables us to conﬁdently infer and disambiguate the chro-
mospheric azimuth (Fig. 5).

The angle between the three-dimensional photospheric and
chromospheric ﬁeld vectors is small for most of the strong-ﬁeld
part of the ﬁeld-of-view, while there is an evident enhancement
of some 40◦–140◦ tracing the inverse-S polarity inversion line
and coinciding remarkably well with the ﬂare ribbon emission
in Ca ii 8542 Å (Fig. 8, left column panels). While the magnetic
ﬂux rope system that has been proposed in various studies (e.g.
Liu et al. 2018b, Inoue et al. 2018, Romano et al. 2019, Price
et al. 2019, Bamba et al. 2020) cannot be identiﬁed entirely in
the inferred maps, it is nevertheless worth noting that the two
patches of enhanced θ in the lower right panel of Fig. 8 ap-
pear to coincide with the footpoints of ﬂux ropes FR1 and FR4
in Inoue et al. (2018). In addition, the concentrations of strong
photospheric and chromospheric ﬁeld (Fig. 5b and e) seem to
be located at—or in the vicinity of—the ﬂux rope footpoints F1
and F2 in Bamba et al. (2020). We therefore speculate that the
observed angle enhancements in the inverse-S head (lower left
panel) and the strong-ﬁeld concentrations in the head and lower
down along the spine may similarly be sampling ﬂux rope foot-
points and that our inferred chromospheric ﬁeld is thus able to
pick up at least part of the ﬂux rope system.

6.4. Discrepancies with the numerical models

The most striking diﬀerence between the numerical models and
inversions is in the amplitudes of both the line-of-sight and trans-
verse magnetic ﬁeld. This can be partly attributed to the diﬀer-
ence in spatial and spectral resolution of the HMI and Hinode
SOT/SP instruments, but the pre-processing for both simulations
plays an equally—if not more important—role. The latter is also
evident when comparing the original HMI ﬁeld vector with the
ﬁeld from both numerical models at z = 0 Mm. Inoue et al.
(2018) use the pre-processing procedure by Wiegelmann et al.
(2006), which modiﬁes the observed magnetic ﬁeld vector to ﬁt
the assumption of a force-free ﬁeld. As a result, the transverse
ﬁeld can get signiﬁcantly reduced, in this case by up to a factor
2 in some places. For the magnetofrictional model Price et al.
(2019) apply spatial and temporal smoothing to ensure numeri-
cal stability of the simulations. In addition, the vector magnetic
ﬁeld maps are rebinned spatially in both approaches, by a fac-
tor 2 and 4 in the MHD and MF model, respectively. Combined,
these eﬀects result in a factor 2–3 in ﬁeld strength amplitude
diﬀerence between the models and the inversions. We note here
that we did not take the instrumental point spread function into
account and that use of spatially-coupled inversions (van Noort
2012; Asensio Ramos & de la Cruz Rodr´ıguez 2015) would fur-
ther increase the diﬀerence.

Obtaining the magnetic ﬁeld vector accurately is ex-
tremely important in space weather modelling and prediction.
Underestimating the ﬁeld strength at the source has a direct im-
pact on the estimate for the ﬂux carried by a pre-eruptive ﬂux
rope and would result in a wrong estimate of its location and
diameter, which in turn would produce a mismatch between the
models and the ﬁeld measured at Earth (T¨or¨ok et al. 2018). It is a
well-recognized problem that an underestimate of the magnetic
ﬂux in observationally retrieved maps can lead to an underes-
timate of the interplanetary magnetic ﬂux (Linker et al. 2017).
This is especially true for the quiet Sun, where most of the ﬂux
remains invisible to current instruments (Danilovic et al. 2016).
However, our results indicate that this may even be the case in
active regions, despite that the ﬁeld there is strong and ﬁlls the
whole surface area covered by a pixel.

The second noticeable diﬀerence between the models and
inversions is the strong enhancement of some 40◦–140◦ in the
angle between the three-dimensional photospheric and chromo-
spheric ﬁeld along the inverse-S polarity inversion line. This
band is conspicuously absent in the MHD model snapshot of
Inoue et al. (2018) which is from approximately 10 min be-
fore our inversions (Fig. 8, right column panels). Pre-processing
could again be the culprit of this discrepancy, but it is con-
ceivable that the increase in photosphere-to-chromosphere shear
may be due to the ﬁeld reconﬁguration during the ﬂare. The lat-
ter ﬁts with the tether-cutting reconnection scenario proposed by
Zou et al. (2019) in their two-step reconnection process, given
that the soft X-ray ﬂux lightcurve goes through a steep increase
between 09:08–09:10 UT, where our Ca ii snapshot lies in the
dead middle of. On the other hand, in their NLFFF extrapolation
the reconnection that precedes and triggers the tether-cutting re-
connection occurs in a null point outside the magnetic ﬂux rope
system, which unfortunately falls also outside our SST ﬁeld-
of-view. The increase in retrieved photosphere-to-chromosphere
shear is also in agreement with the post-ﬂare conﬁguration pro-
posed by Bamba et al. (2020).

Finally, an examination of the original HMI maps indi-
cates that the position of the diverging positive polarity of the
inverse-S did not signiﬁcantly change in the time span of 09:12–

14

09:24 UT. This suggests that the mismatch in footpoint location
between observations and the MF model is likely due to the spa-
tial smearing applied to the original ﬁeld maps as part of the
pre-processing for the latter.

7. Conclusions

We have presented a comparison of the inferred photospheric
and chromospheric magnetic ﬁelds during the conﬁned X2.2
ﬂare in NOAA AR 12673 on September 6, 2017, allowing for
the ﬁrst time to track the variation in magnetic ﬁeld vector ori-
entation from the photosphere to the chromosphere in an X-
class ﬂare. Our results suggest that in the ﬂare LTE forma-
tion of Fe i is not a bad assumption per se, but that non-LTE
inversions may yield stronger line-of-sight ﬁeld in the lower
layers (with median diﬀerences of up to 7–9%, depending on
whether the full ﬁeld or only ﬂaring pixels are considered) and
higher temperatures throughout (up to 25% for ﬂaring pixels at
log τ500 = −2.1). Also, the disambiguated non-LTE ﬁeld az-
imuth presents a smoother map in the strongest-ﬁeld areas than
the LTE results. Without knowledge of the true solution, how-
ever, we cannot rule in favour of one or the other and perform-
ing a similar investigation of a ﬂare simulation would thus be
worthwile.

On the other hand, we see that for this case Milne-Eddington
inversions are an oversimpliﬁcation that suﬀer in the presence
of Fe i emission proﬁles, resulting in erroneous line-of-sight po-
larities. Allowing for depth-dependence is ultimately necessary
for a proper inference of the magnetic ﬁeld vector in this (and
likely most) ﬂaring region(s). In the chromosphere, the spatially-
constrainted weak-ﬁeld approximation oﬀers an excellent esti-
mate of the non-LTE-inferred magnetic ﬁeld vector, where the
ﬁeld strengths may be underestimated by a only few percent
compared to actual inversions.

While the chromospheric ﬁeld points in approximately the
same direction as the photospheric ﬁeld over most of the um-
brae, there is a marked band of enhanced angles (40◦–140◦) in
the three-dimensional photosphere-to-chromosphere ﬁeld vector
that closely traces the inverse-S polarity inversion line. It coin-
cides almost entirely with the location of the ﬂare ribbons ob-
served in Ca ii 8542 Å and is therefore likely due to the ﬂare-
induced ﬁeld reconﬁguration. During the ﬂare there are coher-
ent patches of strong line-of-sight and horizontal ﬁeld that per-
sist from the photosphere (at > 4.5 kG) to the chromosphere
(at > 3 kG) and we ﬁnd some pixels with either ﬁeld compo-
nent in excess of even 5 kG in both photospheric and chromo-
spheric ﬁeld maps. Both these strong-ﬁeld concentrations and
the enhanced photosphere-to-chromosphere shear in the inverse-
S head are found in close proximity to ﬂux rope footpoints
proposed from modelling and our inversions thus conﬁrm such
ﬂux rope system conﬁguration. However, compared to the mod-
els, the amplitudes of the inferred ﬁeld strengths are larger by
up to a factor 2–3 and the photosphere-to-chromosphere shear
is also stronger, more concentrated and ﬁnely structured. Both
pre-processing for and lower spatial resolution of the numerical
models are likely culprits of these discrepancies.

Hence, while full-blown (non-)LTE inversions remain neces-
sary to obtain a depth-stratiﬁed atmospheric model, the spatially-
regularised WFA represents a powerful tool to quickly obtain the
chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld vector with over a large ﬁeld-of-
view. In turn, this can be used as an additional boundary con-
straint in (ﬂaring) active region numerical modelling or help in
improving existing models. Validating or assessing these mod-
els remains very diﬃcult, as one usually only has photospheric

G. J. M. Vissers et. al.: Non-LTE inversions of a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare: I. Vector magnetic ﬁeld

observations and the coronal EUV emission, which the (non-
thermodynamic) models do not directly provide. Additional con-
straints in the form of chromospheric ﬁeld maps are therefore
valuable.

The discrepancies in ﬁeld strength and smoothness between
the models and inversions further emphasise the need for higher
spatial resolution in the models to better constrain pre-eruptive
ﬂux ropes, as underestimating the magnetic ﬂux therein will im-
pact the accuracy of CME evolution modelling in space weather
applications.
