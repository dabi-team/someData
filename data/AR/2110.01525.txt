ABSTRACT

Context. The planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) is a standard candle that comprises a key rung on the extragalactic distance
ladder. The method is based on the empirical evidence that the luminosity function of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the [O iii] λ5007
nebular emission line reaches a maximum value that is approximately invariant with population age, metallicity, or host galaxy type.
However, the presence of bright PNe in old stellar populations is not easily explained by single-star evolutionary models.
Aims. To gain information about the progenitors of PNe at the tip of the PNLF, we obtained the deepest existing spectra of a sample
of PNe in the galaxy M31 to determine their physico-chemical properties and infer the post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) masses
of their central stars (CSs). Precise chemical abundances allow us to confront the theoretical yields for AGB stellar masses and
metallicities expected at the bright end of the PNLF. Central star masses of the sampled PNe provide direct information on the
controversial origin of the universal cutoﬀ of the PNLF.
Methods. Using the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), optical spectra of nine bright M31 PNe were
obtained: four of them at the tip of the PNLF, and the other ﬁve some 0.5 magnitudes fainter. A control sample of 21 PNe with
previous GTC spectra from the literature is also included. We analyze their physical properties and chemical abundances (He, N, O,
Ar, Ne, and S), searching for relevant diﬀerences between bright PNe and the control samples. The CS masses are estimated with
Cloudy modeling using the most recent evolutionary tracks.
Results. The studied PNe show a remarkable uniformity in all their nebular properties, and the brightest PNe show relatively large
electron densities. Stellar characteristics also span a narrow range: < L∗/L(cid:12) > = 4 300 ± 310, < Teﬀ> = 122 000 ± 10 600 K for the
CSs of the four brightest PNe, and < L∗/L(cid:12) > = 3 300 ± 370, < Teﬀ> = 135 000 ± 26 000 K for those in the control set. This groups
all the brightest PNe at the location of maximum temperature in the post-AGB tracks for stars with initial masses Mi = 1.5 M(cid:12).
Conclusions. These ﬁgures provide robust observational constraints for the stellar progenitors that produce the PNLF cutoﬀ in a
star-forming galaxy such as M31, where a large range of initial masses is in principle available. Inconsistency is found, however, in
the computed N/O abundance ratios of ﬁve nebulae, which are 1.5 to 3 times larger than predicted by the existing nucleosynthesis
models for stars of these masses.

1. Introduction

The [O iii] λ5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF;
Jacoby 1980) is the number density of planetary nebulae (PNe)
in a stellar system as a function of their luminosity in that spe-
ciﬁc emission line. It has been measured in more than 50 galax-
ies, proving to be an important standard secondary candle on
the extragalactic distance ladder out to ∼20 Mpc (see Ciardullo
2013, and references therein), and it is planned to be extended
out to ∼50 Mpc (Chase et al. 2021) using novel detection and
analysis techniques with the VLT Multi Unit Spectroscopic Ex-
plorer (MUSE) and similar instruments (Spriggs et al. 2020;
Roth et al. 2021)

The method is based on the empirical evidence that the lu-
minosity of a statistical set of PNe in the [O iii] λ5007 nebular
emission line reaches a maximum value that is invariant with
galaxy type and only has a mild dependence on metallicity (e.g.,
Dopita et al. 1992; Ciardullo 2010). This emission includes up to
80% of the entire light emitted by a PN (typically L ∼ 104 L(cid:12)),
which, for the brightest objects, means ∼600 L(cid:12) emitted in just
a single line (Schönberner et al. 2007).

The bright end of the PNLF in Local Group galaxies was ﬁrst

modeled as an exponential by Ciardullo et al. (1989) as:

N(m) ∝ e0.307m[1 − e3(M∗−m)],

where N is the number of PNe in any given [O iii] λ5007 magni-
tude bin, M∗ is the bright cutoﬀ magnitude, and m is the observed

[O iii] λ5007 magnitude of each PN, computed as

m = −2.5 · log(F5007) − 13.74,

where F5007 is the absolute ﬂux of the nebula in [O iii] λ5007
at a distance of 10 pc (Jacoby 1989). The current estimated
value of the PNLF cutoﬀ is M∗ = −4.54 ± 0.05 (Ciardullo 2013).

Internal tests within galaxy clusters, and comparison with
distances from Cepheids and surface brightness ﬂuctuations,
yield distance values that consistently agree within 10% (Cia-
rdullo 2010). Furthermore, as PNe descend from progenitors
present in any galactic subsystem, the PNLF method is equally
eﬀective for both spiral and elliptical galaxies, providing a
crucial link between the Population I and Population II dis-
tance scales up to 20 Mpc. However, despite the PNLF-distance
method being well tested empirically, it does not rely on a con-
clusive theoretical foundation (Ciardullo 2013): According to
standard stellar evolution, the bright cutoﬀ (M*) should not be
constant within galaxy types, and the brightest PNe should not
be found in old populations.

Theoretical modeling (Schönberner et al. 2007; Méndez
et al. 2008b) predicted that PNe with central star (CS) masses
of ∼0.6 M(cid:12) can attain the observed M* if accompanied by a
suﬃciently delayed optically thick-to-thin transition of the nebu-
lar gas. Adopting the empirical initial-to-ﬁnal mass relationships
(IFMRs) of Kalirai et al. (2008), such a relatively high core mass
would imply progenitors with an initial mass of ∼2 M(cid:12). But, ac-
cording to the evolution and visibility times of a PN, such rel-
atively high-mass stars are too scarce (or completely absent) in
old stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies or haloes to pro-
duce the number of observed bright PNe.

Although evidence points to a constant cutoﬀ, contradictory
conclusions have been reached over the years in trying to ex-
plain why M* should be constant (Ciardullo et al. 1989; Ja-
coby 1989; Dopita et al. 1992; Méndez et al. 1993; Marigo
et al. 2004). It is expected that the cutoﬀ is sensitive to popula-
tion age, but this fading is not observed. Paradigmatic examples
are the galaxies NGC 4697 (Hubble type E6) and NGC 5128
(interacting S0p), both of which contain extremely luminous
PNe, with maximum absolute magnitudes of −5.6 and −5.7, re-
spectively (Méndez et al. 2008a; Peng et al. 2004). The mas-
sive CSs needed to generate these PNe, with lifetimes < 700
Ma, are not expected to be found in these old red populations.
However, Gesicki et al. (2018) showed recently that less mas-
sive stars, Mi ∼ 1.1 − 2.0 M(cid:12), can indeed produce bright PNe
through the accelerated-evolution post-asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) star models from Miller Bertolami (2016). Their model
predicts bright PNe able to explain the PNLF and its bright cut-
oﬀ at smaller CS masses and therefore larger lifetimes, ∼ 1 − 7
Ga.

Davis et al. (2018) tested the Gesicki et al. (2018) results in
the M31 bulge, showing that lifetimes of stars with masses able
to reproduce the observed PN peak luminosities are about 1.5
Ga, too short to be present: More than ten bright PNe are found,
but only ∼2 are predicted. Moreover, those authors showed that,
when a proper extinction correction is accounted for, there are
not only bright PNe where they are not expected, but they are
substantially brighter than previously believed. Therefore, the
question remains open regarding the role of progenitors with
Mi ∼ 1 − 2 M(cid:12) in old systems such as the M31 bulge.

Alternatives to explain the formation of bright PNe and the
PNLF invariance have been proposed, such as binary evolution
(e.g., blue stragglers; Ciardullo et al. 2005), misidentiﬁcation

with other type of objects, or mass accretion in interacting bi-
nary stars (symbiotic stars; Soker 2006). Whether these alterna-
tive evolutionary channels are able to provide the observed num-
ber of M* PNe is, however, not clear.

M31 is the nearest large spiral; it has a fascinating assembly
history and harbors the largest collection of PNe found in any
galaxy, including the Milky Way. M31 PNe represent an opti-
mum laboratory for studying the PNLF and its still incomplete
theoretical foundations (D’Souza & Bell 2018), attracting ob-
servers’ attention in recent years (cf. Kwitter et al. 2012; Balick
et al. 2013; Corradi et al. 2015; Henry et al. 2018; Fang et al.
2015, 2018; Davis et al. 2018). In a pioneering paper, Merrett
et al. (2006) cataloged 2615 likely PNe, enabling the determi-
nation of the PNLF down to ∼ 3.5 mag from the cutoﬀ. More
recently, Bhattacharya et al. (2021) carried out an imaging sur-
vey of M31 over a huge area of 54 sq. deg. that included two
disk regions and six inner halo substructures. Bhattacharya et al.
(2021) increased the number of PN candidates to 5265 (only a
small fraction of them being conﬁrmed with spectroscopy) and
extended the PNLF up to m5007 > 26 mag, enabling the deter-
mination of individual PN luminosity functions for each sub-
structure. Given the large metallicity range covered by the sub-
structures, diﬀerent values for the PNLF cutoﬀ, M*, are expected
and indeed measured by Bhattacharya et al. (2021), albeit with a
slope steeper than theoretically predicted in the low metallicity
regime (Dopita et al. 1992).

Given the above uncertainties, it is necessary to gain further
insight into the nature of PNe at the PNLF tip in diﬀerent stellar
systems. As Davis et al. (2018) highlight, this problem can also
lead to an incorrect estimation of a galaxy’s stellar mass, star
formation rate, chemical history, and the initial mass function.
Even though extragalactic PNe beyond the Magellanic Clouds
are spatially unresolved, precluding knowledge of their mor-
phology and the spatial distribution of physico-chemical prop-
erties, large telescopes provide the opportunity to obtain deep
integrated spectra of the brightest PNe and to determine nebular
and stellar parameters with good accuracy. With this goal, we
present in this paper a detailed study of a sample of the bright-
est PNe in the disk of the galaxy M31. In Sect. 2 the sample
and the observations are presented. Section 3 covers the phys-
ical conditions of the observed PNe and Sect. 4 the analysis of
their chemical properties. Section 5 presents the derivation of the
CS parameters of each object using the results from Cloudy and
post-AGB evolutionary models. Finally, we present a discussion
and the conclusions derived from the study in Sects. 6 and 7.

2. Observations and data reduction

The nine target PNe were selected from Merrett et al. (2006).
They are listed in Table 1. Their m5007 values range between 20.2
and 20.9. Four of the PNe in our sample (those marked with an
asterisk in Table 1) are located on the bright tip of the PNLF.
The ﬁve remaining objects, which are all within 0.5 mag of the
bright tip and therefore still representative of the very bright PNe
that are typically observed in external galaxies, are taken in this
study as a control sample together with other objects from the
literature.

Spectroscopy of these PNe was secured on diﬀerent nights
in September 2015 in service queue mode at the 10.4m Gran
Telescopio Canarias (GTC) telescope on the island of La Palma,
Spain. The Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-
Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph
(Cepa et al. 2000, 2003) was used in its long-slit mode, along
with the R1000B grism and a slit width of 0.8(cid:48)(cid:48), resulting in spec-

ing the observations, the seeing ranged from 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) to 0.9(cid:48)(cid:48), and
the data were obtained under photometric conditions and grey
moon. The total exposure time per target is indicated in Table 1.
The GTC calibration plan provided the G191-B2B (Oke 1990)
spectrophotometric standard star for each observing night. To
minimize the eﬀects of atmospheric diﬀerential refraction, the
long slit was oriented along the parallactic angle for all the PNe
and standard stars.

In Table 2 the basic parameters adopted for M31 and the ob-
served PNe are listed as follows: Col. (2), m5007 as determined
by Merrett et al. (2006) with quoted typical uncertainty of ∼0.07
mag; Cols. (3) and (4), RA (ξ) and Dec. (η) oﬀsets relative to
the center of M31; Cols. (5) and (6), total apparent angular dis-
tance from the center, dapp, in deg and kpc, respectively; Col.
(7), de-projected distance in the plane of the disk, ddisk; Col. (8),
radial velocities adopted from Merrett et al. (2006) with a typi-
cal uncertainty of ∼14 km s−1; Col. (9), expected radial velocity
according to the kinematic model of the extended disk of Ibata
et al. (2005); and Col. (10), diﬀerences between the measured
(Col. 8) and expected (Col. 9) velocities.

Small velocity diﬀerences in Col. (10) of Table 2 give fur-
ther conﬁdence that the observed PNe belong to the disk of M31,
large ones (≥100 km s−1 such as for PNe M2538* and M1074)
may indicate that these PNe are associated with other M31 sub-
structures, also considering their large de-projected galactocen-
tric distances. Positions on the sky of the target PNe are shown
in Fig. 1.

The GTC spectroscopic data were reduced following the
standard procedure using IRAF1. Spectra were bias-subtracted,
ﬂat-ﬁelded, and wavelength-calibrated in 2D. Cosmic rays were
removed using the lacos script (van Dokkum 2001), and then
the sky background was subtracted. Finally, the spectra were ﬂux
calibrated and 1D spectra were extracted using twodspec through
the traces of the spectrophotometric standards, given that, at the
M31 distance, PNe are spatially unresolved. As an example, two
fully calibrated 1D spectra are shown in Fig. 2.

3.1. Emission line ﬂuxes and reddening measurements

The emission line ﬂuxes and the corresponding statistical errors
were measured from the extracted 1D spectra by multi-Gaussian
ﬁt using the splot task in IRAF. The ﬂuxes need to be corrected
for interstellar extinction, which is one of the primary sources of
uncertainty linked to the PNLF. Extinction comes from diﬀerent
contributions, which cannot always be determined empirically.
In general, the interstellar extinction all along the line-of-sight
up to each M31 PN CS is composed of both galactic and local
contributions due to i) dust in our own Galaxy that may change
signiﬁcantly with the position on M31, ii) dust in M31 itself, all
along the path up to the PN, iii) circumnebular dust (mainly from
mass ejected during the early AGB phase), iv) intranebular dust,
mixed with the ionized gas inside the PN shell, and v) circum-
stellar dust (i.e., that located around and close to the CS). By
measuring the extinction from the logarithmic extinction param-
eter, c(Hβ), contributions i) to iv) are accounted for, providing
the extinction to each PN.

The c(Hβ) value was derived for each PN by comparing the
observed and theoretical Hα/Hβ ratio (Storey & Hummer 1995)
adopting the intrinsic ratio I(Hα)/I(Hβ) of 2.86 corresponding
to Te = 10 000 K and ne = 1 000 cm−3. We used the extinction
curve from Cardelli et al. (1989) with Rv = 3.1. The observed
ﬂux ratio, extinction coeﬃcient c(Hβ), de-reddened magnitude
(m5007), and corresponding absolute magnitude (M5007) for each
PN in the sample, are presented in Table 3. The mean value
found, <c(Hβ)>=0.13, and its range, 0.00-0.23 mag, are similar
to those of PNe located at the outer disk and external regions of
M31 by Kwitter et al. (2012, <c(Hβ)>=0.15; range from 0.01 to
0.36), and Corradi et al. (2015, <c(Hβ)>=0.16; range from 0.06
to 0.29), indicating a dominant interstellar, not local, origin.

In the cases where line ﬂuxes are contaminated by almost
coincident He i, He ii or H i lines, and these contaminants ac-

count for less than 2% of the ﬂux, they are considered negligi-
ble. However, in some cases, for example, the [Ar iv] λ4711 line,
blended with the He i 4713 line, or [Ne iii] 3968, blended with
He i λ3965 and H i λ3970 lines, the ﬂux contribution of the con-
taminant lines can reach more than 30% for some of the PNe.
The contribution of H i and He i lines to the blends was therefore
computed from theoretical ratios with well isolated H i and He i
lines, using the eﬀective recombination coeﬃcients shown in Ta-
ble 4 by adopting a ﬁrst estimation of the electron temperature
and density of each PN.

Total errors were determined from the quadratic propaga-
tion of the measured statistical errors of the spectra, which in
general decrease from blue toward red, plus an estimated addi-
tional 3% of the measured ﬂux in order to account for systematic
errors, which include continuum determination, ﬂux calibration
and, although less important, wavelength calibration uncertain-
ties. The error introduced by the extinction correction is also
propagated. Possible errors coming from the decontamination of
blended lines are not included. Measured and de-reddened line
ﬂuxes normalized to Hβ = 100 with their corresponding uncer-
tainties are presented in the appendix (Table A.1). The [O iii]
λ5007 line is saturated in the four brightest objects. The adopted
ﬂuxes included in that Table have been obtained from the theo-
retical relation between the [O iii] λ5007 and λ4959 lines (2.98,
according to Storey & Zeippen 2000).

3.2. Physical conditions

Electron temperature and density, Te and ne, can be determined
in all nebulae from collisionally excited lines (CELs) for both
high and low-excitation regions of the nebulae. Physical condi-
tions were computed with PyNeb (Luridiana et al. 2015), version
1.1.7. Diagnostic errors are computed via Monte Carlo simula-
tions with 1500 random values generated for each line ﬂux us-
ing a Gaussian distribution centered in the observed intensity.
The selected number of random values was established when the
errors converged.

Given the available diagnostic lines, two ionization zones,
with diﬀerent temperatures and densities (see, e.g., García-
Rojas et al. 2018) are assumed: a low-ionization region char-

acterized by an ionization potential IP≤ 17 eV, and a high-
ionization region with IP> 17 eV. We consider Te derived
from the [O iii] λ4363/λ4959 ratio, Te([O iii]), representative
of the high-ionization zone, while Te determined using the [N ii]
λ5755/λ6548 ratio, Te([N ii]), would be representative of the
low-ionization region. In the case of the electron density, ne ob-
tained from the [S ii] 6716/6731 lines corresponds to the low-
ionization zone, while for the high-ionization region the avail-
able diagnostic ratio is [Ar iv] 4711/4740. The resulting temper-
atures and densities are shown in Table 5. Diagnostic Te versus
ne diagrams are shown in Figs. A.1 and A.2 in the appendix.

While the Te([O iii]) determination is accurate in all PNe,
Te([N ii]) has in some cases signiﬁcant errors. An extensive em-
pirical study of the temperature structure in PNe made by Kaler
(1986) showed that Te measured for low-ionization species in
an homogeneous nebula were similar or lower than the temper-
ature for the high-ionization zone. However, this is not always
obtained in practice, as it occurs in some of our PNe in Table 5,
where Te([N ii]) > Te([O iii]). Previous works (e.g., Corradi et al.
2015; Fang et al. 2018) obviate this issue by adopting a constant
Te([N ii]) of 10300 K (cf. Kaler 1986; Magrini et al. 2009) when
He ii λ4686 line is detected (as is true for all our sample). In a re-
cent review, Morisset (2017) showed that high density clumps in
PNe can lead to a possible overestimation of the [N ii] tempera-
ture due to an incorrect treatment of the collisional de-excitation
of the upper level where the auroral [N ii] λ5755 line arises. In
our work the Te([O iii]) has been assumed to be the representa-
tive of the electron temperature for the whole nebula if uncer-
tainties in Te([N ii]) are higher than ∼2000 K (that is the case
for M1687* and M1074). In all other objects, both Te([O iii])
and Te([N ii]) have been used for the temperatures of the corre-
sponding zones, even if Te([N ii]) > Te([O iii]).

In the case of the density, a two-zone scheme was also
adopted as the more realistic situation, and both ne from [Ar iv]
and [S ii] line ratios have been used in all the cases except in
PNe M2068 and M1675, where the [S ii] density diagnostic is
saturated and hence, ne from [Ar iv] diagnostic is adopted.

Although density estimations using [Cl iii] 5518/5538 ratio
were also obtained for three objects, we opted for not using them
given their large uncertainties (see Table 5). We emphasize that
only PNe M1074 and M2860 seem to show well-diﬀerentiated
density zones, while for the remaining PNe, both density diag-
nostics show similar values within the uncertainties.

3.3. Ionic and total abundances

Ionic and total abundances were computed using PyNeb from the
ﬂuxes reported in Table A.1 of the appendix and the adopted Te
and ne in Table 5. We used the combination of atomic data sets
shown in Table 6 for CELs and Table 4 for recombination lines.
Errors in line ﬂuxes and physical conditions have been propa-
gated via Monte Carlo simulations using 1500 random values.

Ionic abundances for diﬀerent ions of O, He, N, S, Ne, Ar and
Cl are listed in Table A.2 in the appendix. According to the two-
zone scheme described in the previous section, ionic abundances
of O+, N+ and S+ were computed for the low-ionization zone,
and abundances of He+, He2+, O2+, Ne2+, Ar2+, Ar3+, Ar4+,
S2+, and Cl2+ were computed adopting the measured physical
conditions for the high-ionization zone. Table A.2 presents the
adopted ionic abundances considered as the most reliable mea-
sure of the ionic abundances. They avoid auroral lines, as well as
lines possibly aﬀected by telluric absorption, He or H contami-
nation, or cases with larger errors.

To compute total elemental abundances, the undetected ion-
ization stages of the diﬀerent elements are corrected by adopt-
ing the usual scheme of the ionization correction factors (ICFs).
Those proposed by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) are used for
all the elements with the exception of N, for which the classi-
cal relation N/O = N+/O+ is applied (Peimbert & Costero 1969;
Kingsburgh & Barlow 1994), following the recommendations
of Delgado-Inglada et al. (2015). Given the importance of this
particular ICF(N) we made the exercise of computing it using
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) recipe and found that diﬀerences
were below 22% in all the objects except for M2860 and M1675,
which are very uncertain since their high O2+/O ratio fall out-
side the validity range for this ICF. Moreover, using Machine
Learning techniques (C. Morisset, private communication) we
estimated the ICFs using the same set of photoionization models
as Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) and considering as an additional
constraint the ratio Ar2+/Ar3+. In this case, the diﬀerences with
the classical ICF(N) scheme stay below ∼25% except, again, in
M2860 and M1675, where diﬀerences are much larger, and are

also discrepant with the values derived using Delgado-Inglada
et al. (2014) prescription. Unfortunately, at this moment there
is no alternative way to determine a reliable ICF(N) for objects
with very large O2+/O, and we decided to retain the same ICF(N)
from the classical relation N/O = N+/O+ for all objects.

The computed ICFs are presented in Table 7, and elemental
abundances are shown in Table 8. We also include, for compari-
son, present Solar System abundances from Lodders (2021).

3.4. Comparison with previous results

One PN from our bright sample (M2538*) was observed by Cor-
radi et al. (2015) using the 3.5m APO-ARC telescope, whereas
four PNe in the control sample (M1596, M2471, M2860, and
M1074) were observed with the 3.5m APO-ARC and 8.1m
Gemini-N telescopes by Kwitter et al. (2012). The latter corre-
spond to their PN10, PN6, PN15, and PN16, respectively (we
note that M1596 was misidentiﬁed with M1583: they inter-
changed PN9 and PN10 IDs). The quality of our spectra super-

sedes those obtained in previous references, giving more precise
physical conditions and chemical abundances. In general, dif-
ferences in the de-reddened ﬂuxes for the same object in bright
and isolated nebular lines as the [O iii]λ4959 are no bigger than
3%, but in the case of the faint auroral line [O iii] λ4363 the dif-
ferences can amount up to 15 − 30%. The diﬀerences in the de-
termined physical conditions mainly aﬀect chemical abundances
that use ICFs with a strong dependence on the determined ion-
ization degree; this is the case of, for example, N/H, and this is
discussed in more detail in Sect. 4.3.

only used the results from the present work. PN M2507 from
Corradi et al. (2015) and PN14 from Fang et al. (2018) are
the same object, and we adopted the abundances by Fang et al.
(2018) owing to the fact that the extinction law applied by these
authors is the same as ours. PN6 from Fang et al. (2015) and
M31-372 from Corradi et al. (2015) are excluded due to the lack
of diagnostic sulfur lines. Finally, PN5 from Fang et al. (2018)
was excluded due to the lack of detection of the [O ii] λ7320 and
λ7330 lines, which precludes proper determination of the nitro-
gen ICF.

4. Chemical abundances in an extended sample of
PNe in M31: Correlations among abundance
ratios

To increase the signiﬁcance of the comparison between PNe at
the PNLF tip with less bright PNe (the control sample), an ex-
tended sample of PNe in M31 from previous studies is also in-
cluded. Data for 21 PNe with high-quality GTC spectra are taken
from Balick et al. (2013), Corradi et al. (2015), Fang et al. (2015)
and Fang et al. (2018)2. Extinction, electron density and temper-
ature, and chemical abundances of helium, oxygen, and nitrogen
have been recalculated from the published line ﬂuxes, in order
to have a complete set of homogeneous chemical abundances of
those key elements. Abundances for the rest of the elements have
been taken straight from the original papers, when available. We
used for all the objects the Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law,
the density ne([S ii]), and the ICF for nitrogen given by the re-
lation N/O=N+/O+. When available, Te[O iii] and Te[N ii] are
adopted for the high- and low-ionization species, respectively.
Otherwise, Te[O iii] has been used for the whole nebula.

We note that diﬀerent subsamples were used when analyzing
the elemental abundances. In the case of duplicated objects, we

2 Spectra from Kwitter et al. (2012) lack the [S ii] doublet in 15 of their
16 M31 PNe (they just observed those lines in one PN, which is in fact
one of our control sample PNe, M1596). Therefore, the density of these
nebulae could not be empirically measured, and the whole sample from
Kwitter et al. (2012) has been excluded from the abundance analysis.

4.1. Alpha elements

All three PN samples show a strong positive correlation of neon,
argon and sulfur abundances with oxygen, as shown in Fig. 3 and
Table 9. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found among the bright,
control, or extended samples, except for a slightly larger disper-
sion for argon in the extended sample – but we note that the
argon ICF was reported by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) as the
most uncertain of their ICFs. A tight correlation is expected for
these four α-elements because they should vary in lockstep after
being produced by the same nucleosynthesis processes in mas-
sive stars.

The relation between sulfur and oxygen deserves further
comment. Figure 3 (c) shows that correlation, including also a
sample of M31 H ii regions from Zurita & Bresolin (2012).

As with Ne and Ar, neither S nor O are expected to be sig-
niﬁcantly produced or destroyed during the evolution of low-
mass PN progenitors, at least not at the high metallicities of the
M31 disk (cf. Shingles & Karakas 2013), but the available data
compiled along the years have shown inconclusive results3. Fig-
ure 3 (c) shows clearly for the ﬁrst time the predicted strong
S versus O abundance correlation for any PN sample (correla-
tion coeﬃcient r = 0.8; Table 9). Comparison can be made,
for example, with Fig. 8 from Shaw et al. (2010), Fig. 1 from

3 Delgado-Inglada et al. (2015) and García-Hernández et al. (2016)
report moderate O production, increasing up to 0.3 dex, in carbon-rich,
low metallicity Galactic PNe.

Henry et al. (2012), Fig. 6 from Maciel et al. (2017), or Fig. 10
from Fang et al. (2018), where a rough tendency of increasing
S versus increasing O abundances for the Milky Way and M31
PNe is apparent, but not quantiﬁed. This result gives us conﬁ-
dence on the quality of the observations and the analysis done.
On the other hand, the whole sample of PNe is located in Fig. 3
(c) just below the area occupied by the H ii regions of Zurita &
Bresolin (2012). We recover here the so-called sulfur anomaly,
that is, sulfur abundances in PNe are systematically lower, for
a given oxygen abundance, than those found in other probes of
interstellar abundances. Henry et al. (2012) suggested that this
“anomaly” could be caused by an incorrect computation of the
contribution of ionization stages higher than S2+ by commonly
used ICF schemes. However, new ICF schemes making use of a
large database of photoionization models cannot solve this prob-
lem (Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014; Delgado-Inglada 2017).

4.2. Nitrogen, helium, and oxygen

Nitrogen and helium, as well as carbon and s-elements, are sub-
stantially synthesized during the evolution of PN progenitors,
whereas oxygen, as mentioned earlier, is not. Comparison of N,
He, and O relative abundances has been carried out along the
years to test nucleosynthesis models and study the progenitors’
evolution. Nitrogen, in particular, is a key element in that anal-
ysis, but its complex nucleosynthesis makes interpretation intri-
cate.

The relations among N, He, and O abundances for the bright,
control, and extended samples are plotted in Fig. 4. A remarkable
result is that, while the nine PNe of the bright and control sam-
ples are strongly correlated in the three diagrams, (a), (b), and
(c), the extended sample of 21 PNe from literature is not. Bright
and control PNe appear intertwined in the diagrams and both
samples have virtually the same ﬁtting slopes and dispersion.

A mild correlation between N and O was reported early by
Pottasch (1983) for Galactic PNe, but only for low (12+log(N/H)
< 7.8) N abundances. Henry (1990) also ﬁnds a positive corre-
lation (r = 0.61) for his non-Type I Galactic PN sample. Kings-
burgh & Barlow (1994), however, did not ﬁnd any correlation,
and conclude that no signiﬁcant production of O via the ON cy-
cle occurs during the second dredge-up, even for Type I PNe.
More recently, Maciel et al. (2017) claimed a positive correla-
tion between N and O for a large heterogeneous compilation of
PNe in the Milky Way and other galaxies, although the corre-
lation is indeed weak (their Fig. 12) and not quantiﬁed. On the
theoretical side, it is expected that, for low-intermediate mass
progenitors with near solar abundances, the secondary produc-
tion of N comes at the expenses of C via the carbon-nitrogen-
oxygen cycle. An increase in N abundance with metallicity is
therefore expected (cf. Magrini et al. 2018). Figure 4 (a) shows
a strong correlation for our PN sample but a mild one for the ex-
tended sample, the latter with a Pearson r coeﬃcient similar to
that found by Henry (1990).

Identical behavior is shown for He and N in Fig. 4 (b): a
strong correlation for the bright and main PN control samples,
but a much weaker one, if any, for the extended sample (Table 9).
As both N and He are produced by the same nucleosynthesis
processes, the observed correlation in our data is expected (while
the lack of it for the extended sample is striking).

Data in Fig. 4 (c) are even more extreme, showing disparate
correlation coeﬃcients r =0.8 and 0.2 for our nine-PN set and for
the extended sample PNe, respectively (Table 9). Neither Henry
(1990) nor Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994) found any correlation
of He versus O in their Galactic PN samples. In the most recent

analysis, Henry et al. (2018) compare the observed He and O
abundances with the MONASH (Karakas & Lugaro 2016) and
LPCODE (Miller Bertolami 2016) models, which indeed pre-
dict a modest enhancement of He with metallicity. Henry et al.
(2018) argue that observational uncertainties of He/H likely ob-
scure this theoretically predicted trend. Our 12+log(He/H) error
bars are typically ±0.02 dex (Table 8), or ±0.005 in He/H, just
at the level suggested by Henry et al. (2018) to allow meaning-
ful comparison of models with observational data. Although the
range in He and metallicity of our PNe in M31 is certainly lim-
ited, and the slope for the ﬁtting line in Fig. 4 (c) is somewhat
larger than model results, they do show for the ﬁrst time the pos-
itive He versus O correlation predicted by the models.

4.3. The nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio
The N/O ratio has been extensively used to confront models
with observations since it minimizes (together with the C/O
ratio) possible eﬀects due to diﬀerent initial composition of
the progenitor stars (cf. Henry et al. 2018; García-Rojas et al.
2018). Furthermore, N and O are synthesized by progenitors
with very diﬀerent mass ranges that evolve with diﬀerent enrich-
ment timescales (see Vincenzo et al. 2016; Esteban et al. 2020).
For this reason, interpreting N/O data has always been a chal-
lenge.

Data for log(N/O) versus 12+log(N/H), 12+log(He/H), and
12+log(O/H) relations are plotted in Figs. 5 (a), (b), and (c), re-
spectively. We emphasize that having adopted the ICF(N) from
the relation N/O = N+/O+, the derived N/O ratios for all PNe
are insensitive to the particular ICF(N) values (Table 7). This
is shown in Fig. 5 (a) where ICF(N) values are labeled for the
bright and control sets. As expected, a tight correlation between
log(N/O) and 12+log(N/H) is observed in Fig. 5 (a) for all PN
samples, indicating that the variation in N/O is mainly due to
variations in nitrogen.

In Fig. 5 (b), which displays log(N/O) versus 12+log(He/H),
we note that there is no object located in the region of type I PNe
following the original deﬁnition by Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert
(1983) (He/H > 0.125 and log(N/O)> −0.3). One of the control
sample PNe, M1675, is located at the N/O≥ 0.8 modiﬁed Type I
zone deﬁned by Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994), but its relatively
low He/H abundance casts doubts about being a true Type I neb-
ula. Figure 5 (b) provides a ﬁrst indication about the masses of
the progenitor stars: The brightest PNe in M31 are not Type I
objects, that is, according to current single-star nucleosynthesis
models, they do not come from massive (Mi >∼2.5 M(cid:12)) progeni-
tor stars (cf. Phillips 2001).

A strong positive correlation for the bright and control sam-
ples (r = 0.8) is apparent in Fig. 5 (b). Such a correlation is
expected since N and O are synthesized independently, while
N and He are enhanced during the evolution of all progenitors
by the same nucleosynthesis processes. Rough correlations be-
tween N/O and He in samples of PNe from the Galaxy, M31 and
the Magellanic Clouds were also found by Kaler (1979), Jacoby
& Ciardullo (1999), Shaw et al. (2010), Maciel et al. (2017), and
Henry et al. (2018) (but not by Kingsburgh & Barlow 1994).

Figure 5 (c) shows a strong positive correlation (r ∼ 0.8)
between N/O and O for the bright and control samples. However,
as in the previous case, it vanishes in the extended sample.

In the case of H ii regions and H ii galaxies, the pri-
mary/secondary production of N is reﬂected in the observed be-
havior of N/O versus O: A plateau is generally found at low
metallicity followed by a linear rise beyond certain metallicity
(Henry et al. 2000; Magrini et al. 2018). However, in the Milky

Way and M31 only a scattered plateau of H ii regions is appar-
ent up to the highest measured metallicity (Esteban et al. 2020;
Arellano-Córdova et al. 2021). For PNe, the situation is even less
clear: a poor, if any, correlation between N/O and O has been re-
ported. Data from Henry (1990), Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994),
and Henry et al. (2018) show a large dispersion with, at best, a
rough increase (or decrease: cf. Jacoby & Ciardullo 1999; Ma-
ciel et al. 2009; Milingo et al. 2010) of N/O with increasing O
abundance.

In PNe with solar-like metallicity and low-mass progenitors,
the correlation between N/O and O abundance seen in Fig. 5 (c)
for the bright and control samples is expected since N is mostly
synthesized at the expense of the O and C already present in
the star. Furthermore, a slope of N/O versus O steeper for PNe
than for H ii regions is also expected since, in a simple closed-
box model, the latter depends only on the secular N and O en-
richment of the interstellar medium up to the present time. In
contrast, the slope for PNe depends on i) the secular N and O en-
richment only up to the epoch of the formation of the progenitors
(the O abundance, in the abscissa), plus ii) the extra production
of N during the evolution of the progenitors (increasing the N/O
ratio in the ordinate). Our data indicate a slope around 70◦ for
the bright and control PN samples, larger than typical values of
around 45◦ from extragalactic H ii regions at similar O/H abun-
dances (Henry et al. 2018).

Finally, we compare in Fig. 6 the observed He/O and
N/O ratios with model results from Karakas & Lugaro (2016)
(MONASH) and Ventura et al. (2018) (ATON). Metallicities
suitable for M31 (i.e., embracing the solar value Z=0.014; Saglia
et al. 2018) have been chosen. Once more, the PNe of the
bright and control samples appear arranged in a clear anticor-
relation, r = −0.65, while the extended control sample does not.
MONASH results for Z=0.007 and Z=0.014 adequately encom-
pass the observed values of He/O for our nine bright PNe and
most of the extended sample, although seven PNe from the latter
lie in the zone of lower metallicity, with log(He/O)>2.6. None
of those PNe are He overabundant Type-I objects, so their posi-
tions reﬂect their lowest O abundance, which is consistent with
the fact that ﬁve out of those seven outliers are located in areas
belonging to the M31 diﬀuse halo and outer structures. More in-
teresting is the behavior of the N/O ratio. As will be discussed
in the next section, the estimated progenitor masses for our nine
PNe are restricted to a very narrow range, 1.1 → 1.8 M(cid:12), and
neither MONASH nor ATON models reach the high values of
log(N/O)>∼ −0.4 observed in ﬁve of our PNe for that range of
masses. A similar discrepancy has been reported by, among oth-
ers, Henry et al. (2018) and points to either a serious limita-
tion of the models (with rotation, magnetic ﬁeld or extra-mixing
not adequately taken into account) or to a wrong determina-
tion of the initial/ﬁnal masses via evolutionary models and the
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram.

MONASH (Karakas & Lugaro 2016) and ATON (Ventura et al. 2018)
models, labeled with the initial mass of the progenitor. Symbols are the
same as in Fig. 3.

In summary, a key characteristic of our data in Figs. 4 (a), (b),
(c), 5 (b), (c), and 6 is the higher degree of correlation of various
elemental abundances for the bright and control samples with re-
spect to the extended sample. Apart from the smaller uncertain-
ties, our bright and control samples represent an homogeneous
population of disk PNe of M31, whereas the extended sample
includes a broader range of populations, with distances ranging
from ddisk ∼ 5 to more than 100 kpc and belonging to the halo
or to its complex outer substructures, which span a wide range
in metallicity covering roughly one order of magnitude (Bhat-
tacharya et al. 2021). The location of PNe in these diagrams, and
even the PNLF of each population (Bhattacharya et al. 2021), is
sensitive to the initial chemical composition, star formation his-
tory, and subsequent interaction of each substructure with M31,
and that would explain the observed dispersion of the extended
sample in the ﬁgures.

5. PN central stars and their progenitors

5.1. Cloudy models
The eﬀective temperature, Teﬀ, and luminosity, L∗, of the PN
central star (CSPN) locate it in the HR diagram and measure,

Galera-Rosillo et al.: On the most luminous planetary nebulae of M31

through the available post-AGB tracks, the ﬁnal mass Mf of the
progenitor star. Then, an initial mass Mi can be derived using
available semiempirical IFMRs.

A grid of models was run for each PN using the pyCloudy
package (Morisset 2013) based on the 1D photoionization code
Cloudy 17.01 version (Ferland et al. 2017). As starting val-
ues for Teﬀ and L∗, we adopted the values estimated with the
method outlined in Dopita & Meatheringham (1991), using the
PN excitation class (EC) and its Hβ absolute ﬂux. The lat-
ter was derived by multiplying the de-reddened spectroscopic
I(Hβ)/I(λ5007) ﬂux ratios in Table A.1 by the I(λ5007)M ab-
solute ﬂuxes from Merrett et al. (2006). For the four brightest
PNe, whose λ5007 line is saturated, I(λ5007) was calculated to
be 2.98 × I(λ4959) (Storey & Zeippen 2000). Excitation class
values were obtained for the nine bright and control sample PNe
from the I(λ4686)/I(Hβ) line ratio (Dopita & Meatheringham
1991). They show a remarkably narrow range of intermediate
ECs, between 4.5 and 6.3.

The aim of the Cloudy modeling is to match a selection of
observed nebular line ratios with those predicted by the model
through a given ionization source and a number of assumptions
necessitated by the lack of information (see, e.g., Jacoby & Cia-
rdullo 1999; Magrini et al. 2004; Kwitter et al. 2012). Cloudy
also requires as an input the energy distribution of the CSPN.
We used the latest Rauch H-Ni atmospheres with log g = 6.5 or,
alternatively, Rauch H-Ca when an eﬀective temperature higher
than 190 000 K is required (Rauch 2003). Chemical abundances
in Table 8 are adopted, and all PNe have been assumed to be
optically thick. The nebular geometry is assumed to be spher-
ical with an inner radius of 1017 cm, and the density is set as
constant. Even so, the eﬀect of diﬀerent density distributions has
been explored, in particular for cases such as M1687* or M1074
where diﬀerent values for the density when using low- or high-
excitation ions have been obtained.

The model selection procedure is based mainly on a positive
correlation of the He ii 4686 and He i 5876 ﬂuxes with the stel-
lar eﬀective temperature, Teﬀ, whereas the absolute ﬂuxes of Hβ
and [O iii] λ5007 constrain the stellar luminosity, L∗. Additional
line ratios, similar to those investigated in Kwitter et al. (2012),
are also taken into consideration, and further nebular parameters,
such as output radii and nebular masses, were always checked to
be kept physically reasonable.

We note that the abundance of carbon, a major nebular
coolant, is actually unknown for the PNe in our sample, and this
may represent an important source of uncertainty in the model-
ing. For this reason, values for the carbon abundance correspond-
ing to C/O ratios of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 have been tested. How-
ever, changes in C abundance result in only small variations in
the He ii 4686, He i 5876, [O iii] 5007, and Hβ diagnostic ﬂuxes,
and we ﬁnally set a C/O ratio equal to 1.0. In short, although
there is no information on the C abundance for our objects, the
main emission-line strengths predicted by the models are in good
agreement with those observed, and we can be conﬁdent of the
robustness of the procedure and the resulting stellar parameters.
The Teﬀ and L∗ from Cloudy modeling are listed in Ta-
ble 10. The most remarkable result is the very narrow ranges
exhibited by both stellar parameters: log(L∗/L(cid:12)) = 3.57 ± 0.07,
logTeﬀ = 5.11 ± 0.07. All nine CSPNe seem to be caught in a
very similar post-AGB evolutionary stage and be produced by
similar progenitor stars. Also, as expected, the luminosities L∗
of the bright PNe are larger (∼ 30% on average) than those for
the control sample, whereas temperatures Teﬀ do not show any
obvious diﬀerence.

5.2. Location in the HR diagram, progenitor masses, and

post-AGB model predictions

The positions in the HR diagram of our nine CSPNe are shown in
Fig. 7, together with post-AGB evolutionary tracks from Miller
Bertolami (2016) for Z=0.02. Diﬀerences between these tracks
and the classical tracks of Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) – basically,
somewhat smaller ﬁnal masses and substantially shorter, accel-
erated evolutionary times for the former – have been discussed in
recent papers (cf. Miller Bertolami 2016; Fang et al. 2018; Henry
et al. 2018). Interpolation of the evolutionary tracks allows us to
estimate Mf for each CSPN, and derive tentative masses Mi of
their progenitors. The uncertainty associated with the interpola-
tion is expected to be ∼ 10 − 15% for accurately derived CSPN
parameters (Serenelli et al. 2021).

The resulting range of CSPN masses for the four bright-
est PNe in M31 (Table 10) is remarkably narrow, Mf=0.568 to
0.578 M(cid:12), with a mean value of < Mf > =0.574± 0.004 M(cid:12).
That is in excellent agreement with the maximum ﬁnal mass de-
rived by Valenzuela et al. (2019) from their PNLF simulations,
Mf =0.58 M(cid:12). The ﬁve PNe from the control sample show, in
turn, a slightly broader range, Mf=0.545 to 0.578 M(cid:12) with a
mean value of < Mf >=0.566±0.016M(cid:12).

This analysis shows that all nine PNe, including the bright-
est ones, originate from low-intermediate mass stars with
Mi < 2M(cid:12). The four brightest PNe (and also, to some extent, the
less-bright control PNe) appear in Fig. 7 tightly clustered around
the turning point of the tracks, close to the “knee" where Teﬀ and
L∗ values simultaneously reach their maxima4.

6. Discussion

Understanding the [O iii] λ5007 emission from the nebular shell
as the CSPN quickly evolves across the HR diagram and, there-
fore, the origin of the observed PNLF is not trivial. The line
emission strength strongly depends on the density, ionization,
and chemical properties of the nebula, combined with the evo-
lution of the post-AGB CS (Schönberner et al. 2007). In this
section we analyze the properties of our targets trying to under-
stand the nature of the brightest PNe as compared to the control
sample, and to the predictions of PNLF theoretical models.

4 It is remarkable that the 12 PNe from Kwitter et al. (2012) not in
common with the current sample are also clustered near the same region
of the HR diagram.

depth (thin or thick) to Lyman continuum photons for the bright-
est PNe is paramount to understand the PNLF, since the eﬃ-
ciency for transforming stellar UV photons into nebular ones
is governed by the changes in optical depth during the coupled
CS and PN evolution. All nine of our PNe show relatively high
electron densities and CS eﬀective temperatures, together with
moderate values of the excitation parameter EC<∼ 6, pointing to
optically thick PN shells. This is also supported by the presence
of the [O i] λ6300 line in all objects. Although the morphologies
of our PNe are actually unknown, any departure from sphericity
would also help to maintain the PNe opaque for longer during
their evolution. Three-dimensional modeling of PNe comprising
dense equatorial tori and thin lobes is found to reproduce well
the observed line emissivities including those of [O iii] (Gesicki
et al. 2016).

Recently, Gesicki et al. (2018) reevaluated the PNLF using
the Miller Bertolami (2016) evolutionary tracks. Seven CSPNe
tracks with Mi = 1.0 − 3.0 M(cid:12) (Mf = 0.532 − 0.706 M(cid:12)), and
the Torun photoionization code for the PN nebular emission
were assumed. They showed that, for the ﬁve models with
Mi = 1.1 − 2.5 M(cid:12), the [O iii] emission reaches values of m5007
near the PNLF cutoﬀ M* during hundreds to thousands of years,
while the nebulae remain opaque. Assuming a Salpeter initial
mass function and four star formation histories representative of
diﬀerent types of galaxies, synthetic PNLFs were built where
the observed bright cutoﬀ is shown to be populated by progeni-
tors with moderate post-AGB stellar luminosities log(L∗/L(cid:12)) =
3.75 ± 0.13. This value is in agreement with, although slightly
larger than, log(L∗/L(cid:12)) = 3.63 ± 0.03 found for the four bright-
est sources in our sample (Table 10). Concerning the CSPN pro-
genitor masses at the bright PNLF end, Gesicki et al. (2018)
estimate a range Mi = 1.1 − 2.0 M(cid:12), which is similar to that of
our full sample, Mi = 1.1 − 1.8 M(cid:12). But we note that our four
brightest PNe display an even narrower range of masses, with
a mean value < Mi >= 1.45 ± 0.09 M(cid:12). According to Gesicki
et al. (2018), such stars would remain above the bright-end cutoﬀ
M* for approximately one thousand years.

In summary, while the Marigo et al. (2004) and Schönberner
et al. (2007) models predict CS masses substantially larger than
what we estimated, the modeling by Gesicki et al. (2018) using
post-AGB tracks from Miller Bertolami (2016) agrees with our
derived values for both luminosities and progenitor masses.

For completion, it should be mentioned that Davis et al.
(2018) studied 23 PNe in the bulge of M31 within 1 mag of the
PNLF cutoﬀ, ﬁnding substantial levels of extinction, c(Hβ)∼0.6,
most of which of circumstellar origin. This implies the presence
of intrinsically overluminous objects, one-half to one magnitude
brighter than the brightest PNe in our M31 disk sample. They
would require, even using the evolutionary tracks from Miller
Bertolami (2016), CSPN masses >0.66 M(cid:12), that is, progenitors
>2.5 M(cid:12), which are not expected to be found in a suﬃcient num-
ber in M31’s bulge. Davis et al. (2018) suggest that objects pop-
ulating the bright end of the PNLF in the bulge of M31 might not
be PNe at all, but nebulae around symbiotic stars, as previously
proposed by Soker (2006). Even if this limitation in the number
of stars with >2.5 M(cid:12) would not apply in the disk of M31, the
present study does not ﬁnd any indication of such a high level of
extinction for the target PNe. The c(Hβ) values range from 0 to
0.23 with, at most, ∼0.1 of circumstellar origin, resulting in the
low CSPN masses calculated. We can also rule out in our sam-
ple indications of a symbiotic nature: all PNe are located well
inside the PN area of the Gutierrez-Moreno et al. (1995) [O iii]
diagnostic diagram, and they show no signs of having bright and

tracks. The ﬁnal and corresponding initial masses are indicated on the

6.1. Physical properties of the most luminous PNe and their

central stars

Summarizing our observational results, we ﬁnd that the nebu-
lar electron temperatures for the bright and control samples do
not show signiﬁcant diﬀerences, whereas electron densities ap-
pear larger for the former (Table 5). The ne weighted average of
the bright sample is ∼40% and ∼18% higher than in the control
sample when measured from high- and low-ionization diagnos-
tic lines, respectively.

No signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found for the masses and ef-
fective temperatures of the progenitor stars in the bright and
control samples. They are in the range Mi = 1.1 to 1.8 M(cid:12), and
Teﬀ = 106 000 to 166 000 K. All four bright PNe are located be-
fore the theoretical isochrone for 5000 a, while two PNe of the
control sample appear slightly older, between 5000 and 10 000
a.

Marigo et al. (2004) studied the evolution of CSPNe by mod-
eling the observed PNLF and its bright cutoﬀ. In their models,
the most luminous PNe are those originated from intermedi-
ate mass stars with ﬁnal masses Mf = 0.7 → 0.75 M(cid:12), setting
a lower limit for the inital mass Mi > 2.5 M(cid:12). They also claimed
that the maximum [O iii] λ5007 emission would be attained by
nebulae at the thick/thin transition during the CSPN post-AGB
evolution.

On the other hand, Schönberner et al. (2007) presented a 1-
D, spherically symmetric, radiative-hydrodynamics modeling of
CSPNe with masses from Mf=0.565 to 0.696 M(cid:12). They con-
cluded that, at odds with Marigo et al. (2004), the conversion of
stellar UV radiation into line emission occurs most eﬃciently
only for optically thick shells, attaining the observed PNLF
[O iii] λ5007 cutoﬀ at M*= −4.5 mag for a stellar mass of
0.62 M(cid:12), provided the PN remains optically thick.

As discussed in Schönberner et al. (2007), and more recently
in Valenzuela et al. (2019), the question of the actual optical

red CSs nor the high-excitation [O vi] line emission at 6825Å
typical of symbiotic stars (cf. Mikołajewska et al. 2017).

6.2. Large N/O ratios found in PNe with low-mass

progenitors.

An intriguing question remains to be answered, namely, if pro-
genitors of the brightest PNe are indeed Mi ∼ 1.5 M(cid:12) stars, how
can they produce the N overabundance found for at least ﬁve
PNe in our sample (those with log(N/O)>∼ −0.4 in Fig. 6), as
well as for many PNe in previous studies (cf. Henry et al. 2018;
Fang et al. 2018). Our ﬁve sources show N/O values signiﬁcantly
larger than expected for their progenitor masses, predicted for
Mi ∼ 3 − 3.5 M(cid:12) stars according to models. Furthermore, data
on our nine bright and control PNe in Fig. 6 suggest a smooth
progression toward larger N/O values as He/O decreases, in con-
trast with the abrupt increase in N/O at Mi ∼ 3.5 − 4 M(cid:12) pre-
dicted by the models.

The issue is related to the low-end mass limit for stars experi-
encing hot bottom burning (HBB) during the AGB. Some mod-
els set the enrichment threshold at Mi >∼ 4 M(cid:12) (Karakas & Lu-
garo 2016; Cristallo et al. 2015; Marigo et al. 2017) while other
models that include overshooting at the boundary core (Miller
Bertolami 2016; Ventura et al. 2018), decrease it to Mi ∼ 3 M(cid:12).
The limit has been continuously pushed down by the observa-
tions: Davis et al. (2019) found a 3.4 M(cid:12) CS of a Type I PN
in an open cluster in M31 where indeed HBB has taken place,
whereas samples of PNe from the Milky Way (Henry et al. 2018)
and M31 (Fang et al. 2018) suggest the limit could be as low as
Mi ∼ 2 M(cid:12). Our data indicate even lower masses, Mi <∼ 1.8 M(cid:12),
for PNe with the larger values of N/O in our sample, and no ex-
tant model is able, to our knowledge, to reach near that value.

A possible way to circumvent this conundrum is to reeval-
uate the IFMR of low-intermediate mass stars, and a recent
paper from Marigo et al. (2020) might represent an important
step forward in that direction. They carefully determine initial
and ﬁnal masses for a sample of white dwarfs (WDs) in old
Galactic open clusters, and ﬁnd a kink at Mi = 1.65 − 2.10 M(cid:12)
in the IFMR, whose peak at Mi ∼ 1.8 − 1.9 M(cid:12) corresponds
to measured WD masses of Mf = 0.70 − 0.75 M(cid:12). It is impor-
tant to emphasize that those semiempirical data strongly dis-
agree with current models of AGB evolution: CSPN with masses
of Mf = 0.70 − 0.75 M(cid:12) would originate from main sequence
stars with much larger masses Mi >∼ 3 − 3.5 M(cid:12) according to the
Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) or Miller Bertolami (2016) mod-
els. Moreover, stars with masses around Mi ∼ 1.5 M(cid:12), located
at the lower-mass side of the IFMR kink, would evolve into
relatively high-mass, Mf ∼ 0.6 M(cid:12), WDs according to Marigo
et al. (2020). That is larger than Miller Bertolami (2016) model
tracks predict (a Mf ∼ 0.6 M(cid:12) star would originate from a
Mi ∼ 2.3 M(cid:12) star according to his modeling), although we note
that Mi = 1.5 M(cid:12) progenitors do end as Mf ∼ 0.6 M(cid:12) dwarfs in
Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) tracks.

Determining accurate masses from WD stars and their pro-
genitors is a diﬃcult task, and the Mi ∼ 1.5 M(cid:12) region of the
IFMR from Marigo et al. (2020) is really based on data from
a single open cluster, M67 (their Fig. 1). A recent reevaluation
of seven WD masses belonging to that cluster by Canton et al.
(2021) conﬁrm the mean value of Mf = 0.60 ± 0.01 M(cid:12) for the
WDs, and Mi = 1.52 ± 0.04 M(cid:12) for their progenitors (quoted un-
certainties are formal errors of the mean, not dispersion of the
sample).

Assuming that Mi ∼ 1.5 M(cid:12) stars, like the proposed progeni-
tors of our four brightest PNe, would end as Mf ∼ 0.6 M(cid:12) CSPN,

we wish to determine what eﬀects this would have on the nu-
cleosynthesis and the yields of elements such as He, C, N, and
possibly O. We also want to know if the discrepancy between
predicted and observed N/O ratios will be solved or alleviated,
given the now more massive stellar cores of the AGB stars.

In the mass regime Mi ∼ 1.5 − 2.0 M(cid:12) a process takes place
that is key to understanding the AGB and post-AGB evolution:
stars with solar metallicity and masses up to Mi ∼ 1.8 − 1.9 M(cid:12)
experience a core He ﬂash at the beginning of their core He-
burning phase, while those with Mi = 2.0 M(cid:12) and larger do
not. That deﬁnes the fundamental frontier between low- and
intermediate-mass stars, and changes not only the evolution-
ary timescales, but also the strength of the 3rd dredge-up
and the chemistry. As mentioned earlier, that mass limit at
Mi ∼ 1.8 − 1.9 M(cid:12) also coincides with the observed kink in
the IFMR, making CSPN and WD stars that are more mas-
sive than previously thought (Marigo et al. 2020). On the other
hand, according to Miller Bertolami (2016) modeling, it is just
at Mi = 1.5 M(cid:12) where the largest carbon enrichment is ex-
pected, almost double that of a Mi = 2.0 M(cid:12) star (his Fig. 6).
If such an Mi = 1.5 M(cid:12) star were to end as an Mf = 0.60 M(cid:12)
CSPN its properties would be quite diﬀerent from one with
Mf = 0.576 − 0.580 M(cid:12) in terms of 3rd dredge-up eﬃciency, ini-
tial H envelope, and H-burning rate, and it would have higher
luminosity (Miller Bertolami 2016). However, in terms of the N
surface enrichment, only at masses Mi > 3.0 M(cid:12) does there ap-
pear a signiﬁcant jump upward according to all extant models,
and therefore the origin of the disagreement between modeled
and observed N/O ratios remains unexplained.

Further eﬀorts to improve low-mass star models, including
extra-mixing processes beyond overshooting, such as rotation
(meridional circulation and diﬀusion by shear turbulence), mag-
netic ﬁeld, or thermohaline mixing, have been encouraged by
better and better observational data in recent years (Delgado-
Inglada et al. 2015; Henry et al. 2018; Fang et al. 2018). The
substantial N overabundance measured in several of the most lu-
minous PNe in M31 provides motivation for these continuing
eﬀorts.

7. Conclusions

The PNLF is an astrophysical observable that appears to have a
universal bright cutoﬀ. This is thought to be caused by an un-
expected constancy in the combined results from the complex
physics of stellar interiors, stellar evolution all along the HR di-
agram, nucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes, the physics of
envelope ejection, ionization, and the dynamical evolution of the
PNe. In addition to having a mild dependence on metallicity, all
these processes seem to “conspire" to yield an extremely simple
result: All the brightest PNe in old and younger stellar systems
have a unique cutoﬀ magnitude at M∗ = −4.54 ± 0.05.

While the building of the PNLF itself has been recently ex-
plained using updated stellar evolutionary tracks (Gesicki et al.
2018; but see Davis et al. 2018), the detailed nature of the PNe
populating the bright end of the PNLF is still largely unknown
due to distance uncertainties for Galactic PNe and the inherent
faintness of PNe in external galaxies.

The goal of this work has been to analyze in detail a repre-
sentative sample of bright PNe in the galaxy M31, our closest
Milky Way-like neighbor, which hosts the largest collection of
PNe known in any galaxy. We carefully selected and observed
two samples of “bright PNe" (four objects inside the bright cutoﬀ
bin) and “control PNe" (ﬁve objects typically 0.5 mag fainter).
We supplemented them with an “extended sample" of another 21

PNe from previous works observed with the same telescope and
instrument and reanalyzed here to ensure homogeneity. Relevant
conclusions from this work are:

– 10.4m GTC spectra obtained under excellent observing con-
ditions allow us to reach the unprecedented depth of a 3σ
rms signal at ∼0.2% of I(Hβ) in the blue, even in the faintest
nebulae.

– These spectra are carefully and homogeneously analyzed
using updated physics and the most recent ICFs for abun-
dance calculations, minimizing the uncertainties in the de-
rived physico-chemical properties.

– The four brightest and the ﬁve control PNe show a remark-
able uniformity in nebular characteristics: Electron temper-
atures range between Te([O iii])=10 100 and 12 700 K. All
nebulae show large electron densities, ne([Ar IV]) = 5000 −
32000 cm−3, those of the brightest nebulae being, on average,
∼ 40% larger than those of the control sample. The nebular
ECs also span a narrow range of EC=4.5-5.6 for the bright
and control nebulae.

– Derived abundances for He, Ne, N, O, Ar, and S agree neatly
with their predicted qualitative interrelations, and this is the
ﬁrst time such global agreement is observed in any PN sam-
ple, including those in the Milky Way. Namely, i) three ob-
served alpha-elements, Ne, Ar, and S, behave, as theoreti-
cally expected, in lockstep with respect to O, and the ex-
pected tight S/H versus O/H correlation is measured for the
ﬁrst time (while the sulfur anomaly persists). ii) He and N
appear strongly correlated with each other and with O, fol-
lowing their expected dependence on metallicity but, signif-
icantly, only for the bright and control, not the extended,
samples. iii) The expected He versus O, N/O versus He, and
N/O versus O correlations are observed clearly for the ﬁrst
time, again only for the bright and control samples. iv) The
diagram N/O versus He/O is introduced and shows a tight
anticorrelation (once more, only for the bright and control
samples), allowing comparison with two families of mod-
els, MONASH (Karakas & Lugaro 2016) and ATON (Ven-
tura et al. 2018). Whereas He/O ratios are consistent with
model results, measured N/O values are 1.5-3 times larger
than model predictions for the range of progenitor masses
derived for ﬁve of our PNe. This, adding to previous cases
from the literature, indicates an important limitation in the
models. v) The contrasting behavior of the bright and control
samples, on the one hand, and the extended sample, on the
other, is thought to be caused by the fact that the extended
sample is an inhomogeneous collection of PNe that belong
to diﬀerent M31 components (the extended halo or its outer
substructures, the Warp, G1 Clump, Northern Spur, and Gi-
ant Stream), with diﬀerent chemical compositions and star
formation histories.

– A primary goal of this work was to determine the CS masses
(and progenitor initial masses via an IFMR) of these bright
PNe. Cloudy modeling indicates a remarkably homogeneous
set of luminosities and eﬀective temperatures, with average
values and a 1σ dispersion of < L∗/L(cid:12) > = 4 300 ± 310,
Teﬀ = 122 000 ± 10 600 K for the CS of the bright sample,
and < L∗/L(cid:12) > = 3 300 ± 370, Teﬀ = 135 000 ± 26 000 K for
those in the control sample.

– The CS of the four brightest PNe appear closely grouped
at the “knee" of the Mi = 1.5 M(cid:12) evolutionary track from
Miller Bertolami (2016), whereas those of the ﬁve con-
trol PNe span a slightly broader range of initial masses,
Mi = 1.1 → 1.8 M(cid:12)

Our overall conclusion is that the brightest PNe in the (ex-
tended) disk of M31 are normal, moderately dense nebulae, with
low-mass, Mi ∼ 1.5 M(cid:12), progenitors, that, according to the mod-
eling by Gesicki et al. (2018), are able to populate the bright end
of the PNLF for ∼1 000 years. We note that the stellar mass dis-
tribution in a star-forming environment such as the disk of M31
spans a large range, including stars with higher masses that reach
larger luminosities in their post-AGB evolution. We plan to ex-
tend this work to stellar systems with diﬀerent star formation his-
tories or metallicities, starting from the Large Magellanic Cloud,
to gain more comprehensive observational constraints about PNe
at the tip of the PNLF.
