Abstract. The spectral shape of the electrons from the two ﬁrst-forbidden unique
β− decays of 39Ar and 42Ar were calculated for the ﬁrst time to the next-to-leading
order. Especially the spectral shape of the 39Ar decay can be used to characterise this
background component for dark matter searches based on argon. Alternatively, due to
the low thresholds of these experiments, the spectral shape can be investigated over a
wide energy range with high statistics and thus allow a sensitive comparison with the
theoretical predictions. This might lead to interesting results for the ratio of the weak
vector and axial-vector constants in nuclei.

Spectral shapes of forbidden argon β decays as background component for rare-event searches2

1. Introduction

Liquid Argon (LAr) as a detection material is widely used in nuclear and particle physics
with new applications coming in. The range covers calorimetry in high-energy-physics
experiments at LHC all the way to large-scale low-background experiments for rare-
event searches, especially dark matter. In addition, a 40 kiloton scale LArTPC detector
is envisaged for the DUNE [1] long-baseline neutrino program. The GERDA experiment
[2], searching for neutrino-less double beta decay using Ge-semiconductor detectors, is
cooling its detectors with LAr.

The focus of this paper is on the low-background section of the potential
experiments, especially dark matter experiments, of which two ongoing LAr experiments
are DEAP-3600 [3] and DarkSide-50 [4]. The question arises whether there are additional
background contributions from the Ar itself. Indeed, Ar has three long-living nuclides,
37Ar, 39Ar and 42Ar, which deserve some attention. First, there is the well-known 37Ar
with a half-life of 35 days, which was the signal of the Homestake experiment for the
radiochemical detection of solar neutrinos using a 37Cl detector [5]. This isotope decays
via electron capture (EC) without emission of gamma rays, but it will produce X-ray
lines below 10 keV. The isotope 37Ar might be produced by thermal neutron captures on
36Ar, but this nuclide has only a small abundance of 0.337 %. More severe contaminants
are the long-living nuclides 39Ar and 42Ar, which we will discuss now in a bit more in
detail.

The decay of both isotopes into the ground state of the corresponding daughter
−) for 39Ar and
nucleus is characterised as ﬁrst-forbidden unique β−-decay: ( 7

(0+ → 2−) for 42Ar. The β-decay endpoints are given by 565 ± 5 keV (39Ar) and 599
± 6 keV (42Ar), respectively [7]. The measured half-lives for 39Ar are 265 ±30 years
[8] and 269± 3 years [9]. Its content is on the level of 10 mBq/m3 [11] and the speciﬁc
activity was measured by the WARP experiment to be 1.01 ± 0.02 ± 0.08 Bq per kg of
natural Ar [10]. The current accepted half-life for 42Ar is 32.9 ±1.1 years [9]. In none
of the publications a β-spectrum of the corresponding Ar beta decay is shown.

In this paper we study the β-decay spectral shapes of the two isotopes 39Ar and
42Ar. We calculate the shapes using up to date nuclear models. In this way we plan to
predict the expected β-spectrum shape for the Ar-based dark-matter experiments and,
on the other hand, encourage the experimentalists to provide a spectrum which can be
compared with theory.

2. Calculation of the spectral shape of 39Ar and 42Ar

In order to simplify the nuclear β−-decay theory enough to allow us to do practical
calculations we use the so-called impulse approximation in which at the exact moment
of decay the decaying nucleon only feels the weak interaction [12]. The strong interaction
with the remaining A − 1 nucleons is ignored, and thus the pion exchange and other
many-body eﬀects are neglected. In the impulse approximation a neutron decays into

Spectral shapes of forbidden argon β decays as background component for rare-event searches3

a proton via emission of a massive W − vector boson which in turn decays into an
electron and an anti-neutrino. Due to the large mass of the W − boson in comparison
to the energy scale of the nuclear beta decay, the W − boson couplings to the baryon
and lepton vertices, with weak-interaction coupling strength gW, can be approximated
as a single eﬀective interaction vertex with eﬀective coupling strength GF, the Fermi
constant. When the decay process is described with the eﬀective point-like interaction
vertex, the probability of the electron being emitted with kinetic energy between We
and We + dWe is

P (We)dWe =

1
2π3(cid:126) C(We)

GF
((cid:126)c)6
× pecWe(W0 − We)2F0(Z, We)dWe ,

(1)

where pe is the momentum of the electron, Z is the proton number, F0(Z, We) is the
Fermi function, and W0 is the end-point energy of the β spectrum. The nuclear-structure
information is in the shape factor C(we). Integrating Eq. (1) over the possible electron
energies gives the total transition probability, and thus the half-life of the β− decay.

The half-life of a β decay can be written as

where ˜C is the integrated shape factor and the constant κ has the value [13]

θC being the Cabibbo angle. In order to simplify the formalism it is usual to introduce
unitless kinematic quantities we = We/mec2, w0 = W0/mec2, and p = pec/(mec2) =

e − 1. With the unitless quantities the integrated shape factor can be expressed as

The characteristics of the electron spectrum are encoded in the shape factor C(we),
which can be expressed as [14]

with minimal angular-momentum transfer, so in the case of the unique forbidden
decays studied in this work, we only consider the sum that satisﬁes the condition
ke + kν = K + 2. The quantities MK(ke, kν) and mK(ke, kν) have lengthy expressions
involving kinematic and nuclear form factors. The explicit expressions can be found
from [14] (the expressions were also given in the recent article [15]). The form factors
appearing in these expressions can be expanded as power series of qR/(cid:126) as

where q = |pe + pν| and R is the nuclear radius.
In practical calculations the
quantities MK(ke, kν) and mK(ke, kν) are expanded as a power series of the quantities
η1,2,3,4,5 = αZ, peR/(cid:126), qR/(cid:126), mecR/(cid:126), and WeR/(cid:126)c. MK(ke, kν) and mK(ke, kν) consist
of terms proportional to (cid:81)
In the case of the
unique decays the often used leading-order approximation takes into account only the
(peR/(cid:126))ke−1(qR/(cid:126))kν−1 term, while the here adopted next-to-leading-order treatment
[15] takes into account also the (peR/(cid:126))ke−1(qR/(cid:126))kν−1ηj terms. The leading-order and
next-to-leading-order expressions of the β-decay shape factor are discussed in detail in
[15] for a more general framework including also the (more involved) non-unique

In the impulse approximation the nuclear form factors can be replaced by nuclear
matrix elements (NMEs) [14]. In the leading-order approximation there is only one NME
contributing to the shape factor for the unique decays. Therefore, the spectrum-shape
and the half-life are proportional to g−2
A , where gA is the weak axial-vector coupling
constant. When the next-to-leading-order terms are taken into account, the number
of contributing NMEs increases to ﬁve, with each NME carrying a prefactor gA or gV
(weak vector coupling constant). As a result, the shape factor can be expressed as a
decomposition

C(we) = g2

VCV(we) + g2

ACA(we) + gVgACVA(we) .

(7)

In the here adopted next-to-leading-order theory the dependence on the weak coupling
constants of the spectrum shape for the studied decays of Argon isotopes is, at least
theoretically, non-trivial.

The choice of a nuclear model enters the picture when calculating the one-body
transition densities (OBTDs) needed for the evaluation of the NMEs related to the
transition. In this work the wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal states were calculated
using the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model (MQPM) [17, 18] and the nuclear
shell model. The MQPM is a fully microscopic model which can be used to describe
spherical odd-A nuclei, in the case of this work 39Ar and 39K. In the MQPM the states
of the odd-A nucleus are built from BCS quasiparticles and their couplings to QRPA
phonons. The quasiparticles and phonons emerge from the calculations done on the
neighboring even-even reference nucleus (here 38Ar). The MQPM has previously been
used in the calculations of forbidden beta-decay spectrum shapes in Refs. [15, 19, 20].

shell model. The experimental excitation spectrum is from [16].

The practical application of the MQPM model follows the same basic steps as in the
earlier studies (see Refs. [15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]) including the use of the Bonn one-boson-
exchange potential with G-matrix techniques [18]. The single-particle energies, used to
solve the BCS equations, were calculated using the Coulomb-corrected Woods-Saxon
potential with the Bohr-Mottelson parametrization [23]. The valence space spanned the
orbitals 0s0p1s0d0f 1p0g9/2. The BCS one-quasiparticle spectra were tuned by adjusting
manually some of the key single-particle energies to get a closer match between the low-
lying one-quasiparticle states and the corresponding experimental ones. The empirical
pairing gaps, computed using the data from [6], were adjusted to ﬁt the computed
ones by tuning the pairing strength parameters gp

separately. In the MQPM calculations an extended cutoﬀ energy of 6.0 MeV was used
for the QRPA phonons instead of the 3.0-MeV cutoﬀ energy used in Refs. [19, 20].

The shell-model OBTDs were calculated using the shell-model code NuShellX@MSU
[24] with the eﬀective interaction sdpfnow [25], tuned for the 1s0d0f 1p valence space.
Since performing a shell-model calculation in the entire half-ﬁlled 1s0d0f 1p valence
space would be impossible due to the extremely large dimensions of the shell-model
Hamiltonian matrix, some controlled truncations were made. We limited the protons to
the sd-shell, leaving the f p-shell empty, and forced a complete ﬁlling of the sd-shell for
neutrons, leaving the entire f p-shell as the neutron valence space. These truncations

are reasonable since we are only interested in the ground-state wave functions, to which
conﬁgurations opening the neutron sd-shell and proton conﬁgurations with protons in
the f p-shell have very small contributions due to the considerable energy gap between
the two shells. The adopted shell-model Hamiltonian predicts correctly the spin-parities
of the low-lying states in the studied nuclei. As an example, the energy spectra of 39Ar,
predicted by the MQPM and shell model, are compared with the experimental spectrum
[16] in Fig. 1. In the shell-model spectrum the positive-parity states are missing, since
the odd neutron is restricted to the f p-shell.

The electron spectrum of the 39Ar decay is presented in Fig. 2. Here the next-to-
leading-order terms are taken into account and the values gV = gA = 1 were adopted for

the weak coupling constants. The spectra were calculated also using the gA/gV ratios
0.8−1.2 but the spectra coincided perfectly, meaning that the possible dependence of the
spectrum shape on the weak coupling constants is very weak. The spectra calculated
using the shell model and the MQPM agree also extremely well, suggesting that the
uncertainty related to the wave functions of the initial and ﬁnal states is tiny. The
diﬀerence between the two spectra is largest at the low-energy end, while at the high-
energy end the spectra coincide perfectly. In Fig. 3 a zoom-in of the low-energy part
of the spectrum is presented, with the next-to-leading-order terms of the shape factor
either included or neglected. The diﬀerence in the intensities predicted by the two
models, with the next-to-leading-order terms included, is at most 0.5% of the intensity.
When the next-to-leading-order-terms are taken into account, the dependence of the
shape-factor on the ratio gA/gV becomes non-trivial for the unique forbidden decays.

Figure 6. Electron spectrum of the ground-state-to-ground-state decay of 42Ar
calculated using the shell model with the eﬀective interaction sdpfnow [25]. The
experimental spectrum is from NNDC [16].

The diﬀerence between the 39Ar spectra calculated using diﬀerent values of gA/gV is
largest at the low-energy end. The magniﬁed low-energy shell-model electron spectrum
is presented in Fig. 4. With larger quenching of gA, the intensity of the low-energy
electrons increase slightly, but the diﬀerence is negligible within the accuracy of practical
measurements.

The ﬁnal source of uncertainty of the spectrum shape is the uncertainty related
to the Q-value. The current experimental Q-value of the 39Ar decay is 565 ± 5 keV.
The shell-model spectra with Q-values 560, 565, and 570 keV are plotted in Fig. 5.
Here a small diﬀerence between the spectra can be seen without further magniﬁcation.
The uncertainty related to the Q-value seems to be by far the largest contributor to
the uncertainty in the theoretical spectrum-shape. The change in Q-value stretches the
spectrum, but the overall shape does not change.

For the 42Ar ground-state-to-ground-state decay the MQPM cannot be applied.
The uncertainties related to the wave functions were negligible in the case of 39Ar, as
well as in the several other ﬁrst-forbidden unique decays studied in Ref. [20], so the
application of only one nuclear model should be suﬃcient. The electron spectrum is
presented in Fig. 6. Again, there is no signiﬁcant dependence on the values of gA and
gV. For the decay of the 42Ar isotope the experimental uncertainty of the Q-value is at 6
keV, similar to that of the 39Ar isotope, and thus the uncertainty of the spectrum-shape
is also of a similar magnitude.

3. Summary and conclusions

In this paper the β spectra of ﬁrst-forbidden unique decays of 39Ar and 42Ar were
calculated for the ﬁrst time using a next-to-leading-order weak theory. The involved
nuclear wave functions were computed by using the nuclear shell model and the
microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model. The major uncertainty in studies of the

Spectral shapes of forbidden argon β decays as background component for rare-event searches9

speactral shapes is related to the uncertainty of the Q-value. Among the diﬀerent
calculations only very tiny diﬀerences could be observed at low energy of the β
spectrum, which can be studied in detail with running or future LAr dark-matter
detectors, as they are sensitive in this energy range. This high sensitivity might allow
to explore the gA/gV ratio of the weak coupling constants. The higher-energy part of
the β spectrum of 39Ar can already be seen in the released spectra of the GERDA
experiment, but the lower-energy part might be disturbed due to dead-layer eﬀects of
the Ge detectors. To summarise, the calculated β spectra can help to characterise the
background contribution of the two studied isotopes for dark-matter searches based on
LAr dark-matter detectors. On the other hand, these experiments can investigate the
presently predicted spectral shape in detail as the expected decay rate, especially for
39Ar, is reasonably high in these detectors.
