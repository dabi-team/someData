We present study of the complex event consisting of several solar wind tran-
sients detected by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) on 4 – 7 August
2011, that caused a geomagnetic storm with Dst= −110 nT. The supposed
coronal sources – three ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) occurred on
2 – 4 August 2011 in the active region (AR) 11261. To investigate the solar
origin and formation of these transients we studied kinematic and thermody-
namic properties of the expanding coronal structures using the Solar Dynamics
Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) EUV images and the
diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) diagnostics. The Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI) magnetic ﬁeld maps were used as the input data for the 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to describe the ﬂux rope ejection (Pagano,
Mackay, and Poedts, 2013b). We characterize the early phase of the ﬂux rope
ejection in the corona, where the usual three-component CME structure formed.
The ﬂux rope ejected with a speed of about 200 km s−1 to the height of 0.25 R⊙.
The kinematics of the modeled CME front agrees well with the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO) EUV measurements. Using the results of the
plasma diagnostics and MHD modeling, we calculated the ion charge ratios of
carbon and oxygen as well as the mean charge state of iron ions of the 2 August
2011 CME, taking into account the processes of heating, cooling, expansion,
ionization, and recombination of the moving plasma in the corona up to the
frozen-in region. We estimated a probable heating rate of the CME plasma in
the low corona by matching the calculated ion composition parameters of the
CME with those measured in situ for the solar wind transients. We also consider
the similarities and discrepancies between the results of the MHD simulation and
the observations.

1. Introduction

The key problem of space weather forecasting is the prediction of geoeﬀective
transient solar wind streams that are capable of causing geomagnetic storms. One
of the most geoeﬀective solar wind (SW) transients are interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICMEs). They are considered as interplanetary manifestations
of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with solar activity eruptive pro-
cesses. Observational criteria and properties of ICMEs and their speciﬁc types,
as magnetic clouds at 1 AU, can be found in many publications (e.g. Gosling,
1990; Bothmer and Schwenn, 1998; Zurbuchen and Richardson, 2006; Webb and
Howard, 2012, and references therein).

For the earliest prediction of ICME arrival to Earth one needs to understand
the key factors which determine the formation of the transient plasma ﬂows in the
corona and their propagation in the heliosphere. From an observational point of
view, a typical ICME develops in the corona in four main stages: (1) eruption of
plasma with the formation and expansion of a ﬂux rope in the corona observable
by EUV telescopes up to the distance of 1.3 – 1.7 R⊙ from the solar centre, (2)
appearance of a CME in the ﬁeld of view of white light coronagraphs above the

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 2

Solar origins of transients

limb at the distances > 2 R⊙, (3) propagation of the CME in the heliosphere
visible with wide-ﬁeld coronagraphs or heliospheric imagers, (4) appearance in
situ of the solar wind transient with signatures of ICME – signiﬁcant deviations
of the main parameters (Vp, np, Tp, and B, which are the proton velocity, density,
and temperature, and the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively) from the ambient values
(Richardson and Cane, 2004, 2010). The tracking of a CME from the low corona
to Earth using a qualitative morphological analysis of the pre-eruption structure
and the subsequent events was presented by DeForest, Howard, and McComas
(2013).

CMEs are the clearest evidence of ICME initiations. The source regions of
CMEs in the solar corona can be identiﬁed and localized by their characteristic
signatures: solar ﬂares, ﬂows, magnetic reconﬁguration, EUV waves, jets, coronal
dimmings or brightenings, ﬁlament eruptions, post-ﬂare loop arcades revealed by
continuous monitoring of the solar corona by EUV imaging using well-developed
methods of data processing. Cremades and Bothmer (2004) have studied 276
CMEs in the period 1997–2002 and concluded that the topology of these CMEs
and their orientation were deﬁned by the location and magnetic conﬁguration of
the sources, in particular, the position of the neutral line between two opposite
magnetic polarities. This characteristic has been recognized in the solar event of
2 August 2011, which is considered below.

Prediction of ICME arrival to Earth environment depends on the CME kine-
matics in the heliosphere. Solar wind models describe this propagation. The
simplest one, the Archimedean spiral (or ballistic) model (ASM), is based on
the assumption that the solar wind streams have constant velocity during the
whole passage from the Sun to Earth (Nolte and Roelof, 1973; McNeice, Elliot,
and Acebal, 2011). The ASM model does not take into consideration the evolu-
tion of the CME velocity in the heliosphere, so it can be used only to have an
approximate determination of the arrival time interval with an uncertainty of
half a day. The improved drag-based model (DBM) assumes that the dynamics
of CMEs is dominated by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) aerodynamic drag
(Cargill et al., 1996; Vrˇsnak, 2001; Owens and Cargill, 2004; Cargill, 2004; Vrˇsnak
et al., 2004, 2010; Vrˇsnak and ˇZic, 2007; Vrˇsnak, Vrbanec, and ˇCalogovi´c, 2008;
Borgazzi et al., 2009; Lara and Borgazzi, 2009), i.e. that above a distance of
20 R⊙ CMEs faster than the ambient solar wind are decelerated, whereas those
slower – are accelerated by the ambient ﬂow (Gopalswamy et al., 2000). A
validation analysis shows that the mean uncertainty in predicting the arrival
time of ICMEs by the DBM goes from 12.9 hours, when the deviation of CMEs
from the Sun – Earth line is larger than their half-width, to 6.8 hours when such
deviation is smaller (Vrˇsnak et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2015). Prediction of the
arrival time by the kinematical models is based on the knowledge of the initial
CME velocity at the distance of ∼ 20 R⊙, which is subject to projection eﬀect
depending on the angle between the CME propagation direction and the Sun –
Earth line. Colaninno and Vourlidas (2009) proposed a method to derive the
propagation direction by comparing masses of the CME structure determined
from the Thomson scattering intensities observed by two Solar Terrestrial Rela-
tions Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft located in diﬀerent angular positions.
They found that the direction ambiguity becomes reasonably small (≤ 200) for

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 3

D.Rodkin et al.

angular separations between spacecraft > 500. However, this method does not
take into consideration the CME size and distribution of masses in the 3D CME
structure, so it gives the center-of-mass velocity rather than the velocity of the
leading edge commonly used in prediction.

The aforementioned estimations concern the propagation of single CMEs. In
some cases, two or more successive CMEs propagate in direction to Earth. As
a result of interaction, these CMEs change their kinematic parameters. Temmer
et al. (2012) described the case of 1 August 2010, when interaction of two CMEs
resulted in strong deceleration of the overtaking second CME followed by their
merging and further propagation as a single structure. The authors succeeded
to simulate the kinematical evolution of the second CME using the drag-based
model (Vrˇsnak et al., 2013) varying the drag parameter Γ value and the ambient
solar wind speed from the region of interaction (∼ 35 R⊙) to Earth. Other cases
of interaction between CMEs and analysis of their kinematics by multipoint
observations were described in M¨ostl et al. (2012), Lugaz et al. (2012), Colaninno
and Vourlidas (2015), and in references therein.

Currently several sophisticated physics-based models exist for solar wind
forecasting near Earth and beyond with the use of the MHD approach: the Wang-
Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-Enlil model, MHD-Around-a-Sphere (MAS)-Enlil model,
Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), and their combinations (Jian
et al., 2015). These models structurally consist of two main parts: the solar
coronal and heliospheric components. The coronal part of the WSA, MAS, and
SWMF models approximates the outﬂow at the inner boundary of the helio-
sphere based on synoptic magnetograms constructed from daily full-disk pho-
tospheric magnetograms (Arge and Pizzo, 2000) using a semi-empirical model
based on the potential magnetic ﬁeld approximation. Then, the boundary out-
ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld distributions are used as the initial data in MHD sim-
ulations, which describe the radial expansion and evolution of the solar wind
plasma in the heliosphere.

The Enlil model is a 3D time-dependent heliospheric model based on ideal
MHD equations (Odstrˇcil, 1994; Odstrˇcil, Dryer, and Smith, 1996; Odstrˇcil and
Pizzo, 1999). The inner boundary of the Enlil model is placed at 21.5 or 30 R⊙
beyond the outermost critical point and the outer boundary is taken from 2
to 5 or 10 AU. To predict the propagation of CMEs, the WSA-Enlil cone
model additionally uses white-light images from Large Angle and Spectromet-
ric Coronagraph (LASCO: Brueckner et al. (1995)) and coronagraphs onboard
STEREO (Howard et al., 2008). Such a model characterizes the basic properties
of the CME, including velocity and size (Pizzo et al., 2011; Mays et al., 2015).
This model focuses mainly on the prediction of the arrival time of the CME
without localization of its coronal origin. Mays et al. (2015) in their statistical
analysis of 35 CMEs between January 2013 and July 2014 concluded that the
mean estimated error of the CME arrival by the Enlil model was 12.3 hours.
Inaccuracy of current models to a considerable degree arises from insuﬃcient
knowledge of the interaction of the CME plasma with the ambient solar wind
and other wind components in the heliosphere. Information about these processes
can be obtained from the fast progressing heliospheric tomography based on the
interplanetary scintillation (IPS) in radio waves (Manoharan, 2010).

Solar origins of transients

Among other parameters of solar wind transients, the ion charge composition
of the plasma is one of the important identiﬁers of their origin, whereas it de-
pends on the parameters of the source and remains practically unchanged during
the solar wind propagation in the heliosphere. Analysis of the ion charge state
and mass composition of the solar wind plasma helps to separate its diﬀerent
components and to determine its source (Fisk, Schwadron, and Zurbuchen, 1998;
Zhao, Zurbuchen, and Fisk, 2009; Zhao et al., 2014; Kilpua et al., 2014; Wang,
2012).

It is believed that the ion charge state of the solar wind, registered at Earth′s
orbit, approximately corresponds to its state in the corona at the altitude where
it is ”frozen-in” (a transition to the limiting case, where the ionization and
recombination times of the plasma in the corona are of the order or larger that
the time of the solar wind propagation in the heliosphere (Hundhausen, Gilbert,
and Bame, 1968)). The frozen-in condition is valid at distances between 1.5 to
4 R⊙, which depends on the type of ion and the level of activity (Feldman, Landi,
and Schwadron, 2005).

The main factors that determine the ion composition of the CME plasma and
its evolution in the corona are temperature, density, and mass velocity, which
depend on the level of solar activity. At higher activity, plasma temperature and
density in the source and average CME speed increase. During the expansion
of the CME plasma from the origin to the frozen-in region, its ion composition
evolves, due to various processes, such as heating by an energy release from
the ﬂare site and cooling by heat conduction, radiation losses and adiabatic
expansion. From in situ measurements it was established that the faster CME
and ICMEs, as a rule, have higher ion charge states in comparison to the slower
ones (Gopalswamy et al., 2013).

Gruesbeck et al. (2011) presented a procedure for deriving the ion composition
of CMEs in the corona. To achieve this, they used in situ measurements of the
ion charge states of C, O, Si, and Fe and interpreted them in the context of a
model for the early evolution of the CME plasma. They obtained, in particular,
a best ﬁt for the data provided by an initial heating of the plasma, followed
by cooling expansion. Lepri et al. (2012) presented an analysis and comparison
of the heavy ion composition, observed during the passage of an ICME at the
Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Ulysses. They compared the ion
composition, obtained across the two diﬀerent observation cuts through the
ICME, with predictions for heating during the eruption, based on models of
the time-dependent ionization balance throughout the event. The authors of
both papers based their considerations only on assumptions about conditions in
the coronal sources without comparing them with measurements.

Lynch et al. (2011) and Reinard, Lynch, and Mulligan (2012) used large
scale non-ideal 2.5D MHD simulations of the solar wind and investigated the
ion charge state composition during the CME propagation. They found only
a qualitative matching between the observation and model in the charge state
enhancements in the ﬂux rope material and in its front, because a 2.5D model
is not suitable for the proper quantitative description of the ionization state of
plasma elements. The 3D MHD model presented in this article (Pagano, Mackay,
and Poedts, 2013b) certainly addresses these improvements, however the very

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 5

D.Rodkin et al.

diﬀerent spatial domains of the two studies make diﬃcult a direct comparison.
Pagano et al. (2008) had already sucessfully derived the ion composition from
the post-processing of MHD simulations. They explained several observational
features of shocks connected to CMEs by reconstructing the out-of-equilibirium
ionization state of O vi and Si xii, when an MHD shock undertakes the plasma.
In this article, we present a complex method to predict the ion composition of
the solar wind transients using both numerical simulations and direct observa-
tions of the CME initiation in the corona. Such approach enables us to establish
relations between parameters of the CME source in the corona and the resulting
in situ parameters of the solar wind transients. We consider a case of three solar
events – X-ray ﬂares and CMEs that occurred on 2 – 4 August 2011, which led to
signiﬁcant disturbances of the solar wind near Earth on 4 – 7 August 2011 and
produced a strong geomagnetic storm with a minimum value of Dst= −110 nT
(Yi˘git et al., 2016). In our work, we focus on the investigation of the solar part
of this complex event under favorable conditions, when the associated coronal
phenomena had arisen near the solar disk center and the resulting CMEs were
observed in quadrature by the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric
Investigation (SECCHI: Howard et al., 2008) instruments onboard STEREO-A
and B spacecraft and LASCO C2 coronagraph onboard SOHO.

The paper consists of eight sections. Introduction gives a review of methods
for identiﬁcation of ICMEs and their solar sources. In Section 2, we present
a general description of three eruptions on 4 – 7 August 2011. Sections 3 – 6
contain a detailed analysis of the ﬁrst event of 2 August 2011: the observational
data, diagnostics of the CME plasma, description of the 3D MHD model of
the ﬂux rope ejection, comparison of the results of numerical simulations with
observations, and analysis of the plasma ion composition in the solar source and
its evolution in the corona. The ﬁnal sections summarize the results of our study.
A detailed study of the second and third events of 3 and 4 August, when two
CMEs interacted in the heliosphere, will be presented in a next article.

In the analysis, we used the data from the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO):
the solar EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly telescope (AIA:
Lemen et al., 2012) and the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld maps from the Helio-
spheric and Magnetic Imager instrument (HMI: Schou et al., 2012). Diagnostics
of ﬂares in the coronal sources were fulﬁlled using the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite system (GOES) X-ray data, temperature and density of
the outﬂow plasma were deﬁned by the diﬀerential emission measure (DEM)
method using the AIA multi-wavelength EUV images. The solar wind data
including the ICME parameters and charge states of C, O and Fe ions were
extracted from the ACE data (Stone et al., 1998).

(ISEST)1 related databases. The ICME and CME lists of George Mason Uni-
versity (GMU)2 and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)3
describe only one ICME of 6 August 2011 classiﬁed as the EJ+CIR+SH (ejecta
+ corrotating interaction region + shock) event (GMU list) or SH+EJ (shock
+ ejecta) event (USTC list), which led to the geomagnetic storm of 6 August,
12:00 UT, with Dst= −110 nT. The GMU list associates ICME with the M9
ﬂare and halo CME that occurred on 4 August 2011. The Richardson and Cane
ICME list (hereafter RC list)4 mentions two shocks and two ICMEs, indicated in
Table 1 and marked in Figure 1. The shock times in the RC list correspond to the
geomagnetic storms sudden commencements that accompany the shocks reach-
ing the Earth′s magnetosphere (Richardson and Cane, 2010). The ﬁrst ICME
showed small enhancements of magnetic ﬁeld, proton density, and speed above
the background level. The temperature-related ion ratios, C6+/C5+, O7+/O6+,
and the mean charge of iron ions, QFe, slightly exceeded the background. Only
the structure-related Fe/O ratio showed a noticeable increase to the value of 0.55,
which corresponds to a ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP) bias of ∼ 3 and evidences
a presence of plasma from closed magnetic structures in the source region. The
second ICME displayed a jump of the proton speed to 610 km s−1 with moderate
enhancements of the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude and proton density. Thus, the typ-
ical ICME signatures (Zurbuchen and Richardson, 2006; Richardson and Cane,
2004), except the decreased proton temperature and the ion composition, were
slightly shown by both ICMEs. However, identiﬁcation of the second ICME in the
RC list is rather ambiguous because other signatures such as enhanced magnetic
ﬁeld and ion charge state did not appear. The negative values of the z component,
Bz, of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) (−5 and −17 nT in the geocentric
solar magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system) were registered in the sheaths
that followed the shocks, being the most likely cause of the geomagnetic storm
of 6 August 2011. The development of this storm was considered in detail by
Yi˘git et al. (2016).

An application of the ballistic propagation model (assuming that the ICME
speed between the Sun and Earth is equal to its in situ value taken from the
RC list) gives a preliminary time period for the solar events that probably
produced these ICMEs from 31 July 2011, 18:00 UT to 4 August 2011, 13:00 UT.
During this period, three ﬂares and three CMEs, directed to Earth, occurred in
active region (AR) 11261 (Table 2). In order to identify the solar sources of the
solar wind transients, we used simulations of two heliospheric CME propagation
models: the Advanced Drag Model(ADM) (Vrˇsnak et al., 2013) and the WSA-
Enlil Model (Pizzo et al., 2011). For the three CMEs, listed in Table 2, taking
an asymptotic solar wind speed of 350 km s−1 the ADM gives transit times of
74.28, 84.48, and 51.08 hours with a mean uncertainty of ∼ 10 hours (Shi et al.,
2015). These transit times correspond to the time slots of the ICME arrival time

2011, 16:30 UT – 7 August 2011, 12:30 UT, and 5 August 2011, 21:20 UT – 6
August 2011, 17:20 UT (Figure 2). The slots associated with CME1 and CME2
agree well in time with the ICMEs in the RC list and enhancements in the ion
charge state composition derived from ACE data. The slot associated with the
fast CME3 coincides with the noticeable enhancements in the ion charge state
and magnetic ﬁeld magnitude, but was not identiﬁed as an ICME. It should be
noted that the ADM time slots coincide with the ion charge state transients with
a mean discrepancy of 5.6 hours. The minimum, maximum and mean values of
the ion composition parameters for these transients are given in Table 3.

To understand the nature of the third transient, we consider the results of
the simulation of this complex event by the WSA-Enlil model, presented in the
Enlil solar wind prediction helioweather database5. It was found that CME3
(started on 4 August 2011), due to its higher speed, it overran CME2, which
started on 3 August 2011, at the distance of ∼ 0.6 AU, when CME1 had already
reached Earth. In Figure 3 we present the map of the normalized plasma density
in the ecliptic plane for 5 August 2011, 00:00 UT, and the J-map for the three
solar wind transients from the helioweather database. As a result of interaction
between the second and third CMEs, the merged cloud reached the Earth on 6
– 8 August 2011, producing the observed variation of the ion composition.

In Section 3 we consider in general the complex solar wind event of 4 – 7
August 2011, its coronal sources, and in detail the formation of CME1 that
originated on 2 August 2011. The features of the second and third CMEs and
their relations with the solar origins will be studied in a following publication.

processing level 1 to level 1.5 data we produced running-diﬀerence images to
identify the moving coronal structures associated with a CME. These structures
are seen as expanding loops, but in fact they represent projections of the ex-
panding erupting shells integrated over their legs along the line-of-sight (LOS).
In the studied events the largest contrast was seen in the 211˚A channel images.
Figure 4a represents a group of expanding loop-like features in the 211˚A
running-diﬀerence image at 05:58:02 UT, 2 August 2011, in the initial stage of
CME1 formation (Table 1). These structures apparently represent projections of
the eruption shell on the disk plane. Nevertheless, they disappeared at ∼ 06:00
UT, probably, due to the CME take-oﬀ or because of heating, as it will be shown
in the Section 4. The distance-time graphs in Figure 4c show the height variation
of the CME in the low corona, seen in EUV AIA images (channel 211˚A), and
above the limb, seen by STEREO-A/EUVI in 171˚A (Figure 4b) and in the ﬁeld
of view of the LASCO C2 coronagraph. We associated the transverse distances
from the LASCO data with height, assuming the self-similar expansion of the

CME, when the vertical, dr, and horizontal, dh, displacements are in the same
relation as the radial speed of the CME, vr, measured by STEREO-A/COR2,
and the transverse speed, vh, measured by LASCO: dr/dh ≃ vr/vh = 1.09. The
acceleration phase of the CME corresponds to the second peak of the ﬂare ﬂux
proﬁle (bottom in Figure 4c).

Figure 4d shows the dependence of the CME speed on height, calculated
from the data of diﬀerent instruments.Projection eﬀects are not important in
our case. The WSA-ENLIL 3D simulations show that the leading edge of the
CME structure in the ecliptic plane deviates from the Sun – Earth line westward
no more than on 100, whereas the position angle of STEREO-A at that time was
100.50. Thus, the data in Figure 4d, obtained from observations by COR2 on
STEREO-A, represent the real radial velocity of the CME. During the expansion,
the CME speed increased from 26 km s−1 at hr ≃ 0.06 R⊙ to ∼ 800 km s−1 at
5 R⊙.

3.2. Plasma Diagnostics

To derive the plasma parameters from the observed image data on 2 August
2011, we applied a plasma diagnostics methods for the ﬂare region and the mov-
ing coronal structure associated with the CME at ﬁve diﬀerent times. We used
the diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) analysis to evaluate averaged electron
temperatures and densities of the plasma structures under consideration. The
DEM analysis was carried out, using intensities in six SDO/AIA EUV channels:
94 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, and 335 ˚A. In all ﬁve positions along the

structure on 2 August 2011 in the range 0.1 – 0.15 R⊙ from the solar surface are
presented in Figure 5. It is worth noting that the temperatures in the moving
plasma structure are noticeably lower than in the corresponding ﬂare.

4. Numerical Simulation of the Flux Rope Ejection

To model this speciﬁc ﬂux rope ejection in the solar corona, we use an ideal 3D
MHD simulation, coupled with a continuous time series evolution of the magnetic
ﬁeld through a series of quasi-static non-linear force-free (NLFF) ﬁelds . The
latter technique is used to produce a non-potential initial condition that is used
in the ideal MHD simulation. This approach is a combination of the models,

presented in Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2013b) and Gibb et al. (2014), that
has been speciﬁcally tuned for the present simulation.

The key idea is to describe the ﬂux rope formation and the conditions prior
to the onset of the ejection with the time series of NLFF ﬁelds, suited for a
slow, quasi-static, and magnetically dominated evolution, and to adopt a full
MHD description for when the evolution of the system becomes fast, out of
equilibrium and in a multi-β regime, where β is the rate of the plasma pressure
to the magnetic pressure.

4.1. NLFF Time Series

In order to describe the slow evolution of the region of interest, a continuous
time series of NLFF ﬁelds are generated from the corresponding time series of
magnetograms (Mackay, Green, and van Ballegooijen, 2011; Gibb et al., 2014).
In the present application we use 50 magnetograms from 31 July 2011 at 05:00:41
UT to 2 August 2011 at 06:00:41 UT sampled every 60 minutes. The procedure
and set of equations solved is the same as in Mackay, Green, and van Ballegooijen
(2011).

The time series of NLFF ﬁelds is constructed assuming four closed boundaries
at the sides for the 3D box. The bottom boundary, representing the solar surface,
is forced to have magnetic ﬂux balance and the top boundary is set to be open.
In Figure 6a–b we show the initial magnetograms on 31 July 2011 at 05:00:41
UT and the ﬁnal magnetogram on 2 August 2011 at 06:00:41 UT with the
ﬁnal 3D magnetic conﬁguration, shown by the green lines. The initial magnetic
conﬁguration is assumed to be potential, while the ﬁnal stage is highly non-
potential with a magnetic ﬂux rope formed. Over the time series of NLFF
ﬁelds a magnetic ﬂux rope forms as a consequence of the continuous motion
and evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld at the lower boundary. The ﬂux rope forms
along the polarity inversion line (PIL) and is about 0.03 R⊙ long; its central
point is located at the coordinates x = 0.0078 R⊙ and y = 0.018 R⊙, which
in the MHD simulation domain correspond to the heliographic coordinates x =
181′′, y = 205′′ on 2 August 2011 at 06:00:41 UT. The ﬂux rope covers only part

of the PIL, whereas sheared magnetic ﬁeld lines are present along the whole PIL,
marking the non potentiality of the ﬁnal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration.

Figure 6c shows a running diﬀerence of AIA 211 ˚A pass band image at the
same time of the last magnetogram where we apply the sobel ﬁlter to highlight
the coronal structures probably associated with the expanding ﬂux rope. We ﬁnd
that the general topology of the loops is reproduced where the magnetic ﬁeld
lines match the loop structures at the left-lower corner of the image, the system
of loops depart in diﬀerent directions from the enhanced emission region, and
many of the loops around the magnetic ﬂux rope.

It is also crucial to point out that due to a slow variation of the magnetic ﬁeld,
the ﬁnal magnetic conﬁguration is not sensitive to time intervals of some minutes
in comparison to the 60 minutes sampling time of the HMI magnetograms. This
means that the ﬁnal conﬁguration could represent any time within some minutes
around the exact magnetogram used.

4.2. MHD Model

The ﬁnal 3D magnetic conﬁguration from the NLFF time series is then used
as input for an ideal MHD simulation. This approach is an extension of the
technique successfully adopted in Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2013a) and then
further developed in Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2013b) and Pagano, Mackay,
and Poedts (2014), where the magnetic conﬁguration, obtained from a magneto-
frictional non-linear force-free model, is input as initial condition in an ideal
MHD simulation.

In order to do so, we import the three components of the magnetic ﬁeld from
the NLFF time series grid to the grid of our 3D MHD model. Speciﬁcally in
Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2013a) and Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2013b)
there are a number of thorough tests to show that this is possible so that we
preserve the stability or instability of the conﬁguration.

4.2.1. Interpolation of the Magnetic Conﬁguration

In the present article we have simpliﬁed the way in which the 3D interpolation
is performed and have adopted a cartesian grid. In cartesian coordinates, let
B(x, y, z) be the value that we want to compute in the position (x, y, z) that we
know lies in the cell, deﬁned by the indexes [i : i + 1, j : j + 1, k : k + 1], where
the quantity b is deﬁned. We compute

i+1,j+1,k+1

B(x, y, z) =

b(i, j, k)V (i, j, k)/V

(3)

Xi,j,k

where V (i, j, k) is the volume, deﬁned by the point (x, y, z) and the cell
corner opposite to the position (i, j, k), and V is the sum of these volumes.
This approach guarantees the continuity of the solution and its smoothness
independently of the spatial resolution of the grid where B(x, y, z) is deﬁned.

4.2.2. Plasma Distribution

As the time series of NLFF ﬁelds provides only the magnetic conﬁguration, we
need to adopt an initial distribution of plasma density, speed, and temperature in
order to close a complete set of MHD variables. We aim at a realistic and general
representation of the solar corona, so we seek to produce a distribution of plasma
that takes into account the heterogeneity of the coronal plasma. In particular,
we intend to describe the initial ﬂux rope plasma as colder and denser than the
plasma outside of the ﬂux rope. Magnetic ﬂux ropes are structures where the
magnetic ﬁeld is usually more intense than in their surroundings and where the
magnetic ﬁeld presents twist. Therefore, we deﬁne the following proxy function
to link the plasma temperature and density to the magnetic ﬁeld:

where

ω =

ω2

x + ω2

y + ω2
z

q

ωx =

|B × ∇Bx|

ωy =

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where B = (Bx, By, Bz) is the magnetic ﬁeld, the cartesian coordinates x
and y are tangent to the solar surface and z is perpendicular to the surface.
The function ω is positive deﬁnite and peaks where the magnetic ﬁeld presents
more twist and is more intense, e.g. near the centre of the magnetic ﬂux rope
axis. As an example, at the ﬂux rope axis ∇Bz is parallel to the solar surface

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 16

Solar origins of transients

along the direction connecting two opposite polarities and perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬁeld that is mostly parallel to the x – y plane. In this conﬁguration ωz
is relatively high. Additionally, the value of ω is proportional to the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity, which results in it being higher near the solar surface and lower
at further radial distances from the solar surface.

In order to eﬀectively use ω to model the solar atmosphere we deﬁne the

function:

Ω = arctan

ω − ω⋆
∆ω

/π + 0.5

(8)

where ω⋆ and ∆ω are two simulation parameters. Ω is then bound between 0
and 1 and the temperature is deﬁned by:

T = Ω(Tf luxrope − Tcorona) + Tcorona

(9)

where Tﬂuxrope and Tcorona are two simulation parameters that respectively rep-
resent the temperature in the ﬂux rope and in the external corona. The thermal
pressure is independently speciﬁed by the exponential solution for hydrostatic
equilibrium with constant gravity with a uniform temperature set equal to
Tcorona:

p =

(10)

where p is the thermal pressure, ρ0 is a simulation parameter that sets the density
at the solar surface, µ =1.31 is the average particle mass, mp is the proton mass,
kB is the Boltzmann constant and g is the solar gravitational acceleratation at
the solar surface. The density ρ is given by the equation of state:

ρ =

where ρ is the density, T is the temperature.

4.2.3. MHD Simulation

Based on the approach described in Section 4.2.2, and using the ﬁnal 3D mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration, obtained from the NLFF time series as described in
Section 4.1, we construct the initial condition for the MHD simulation. Table 5
shows the values used in our model for the relevant parameters.

We use the MPI-parallelized Adaptive-Mesh Reﬁnement Versatile-Advection
Code (MPI-AMRVAC) software (Porth et al., 2014), to solve the MHD equations,

The computational domain is composed of 256×256×248 cells, distributed on
a uniform grid. The simulation domain is similar to the one used in the time series
of NLFF ﬁelds and it extends over 0.267 R⊙ in the x and y direction and over
0.266 R⊙ in the z direction, starting from z = 0.0027 R⊙ above the photosphere.
The boundary conditions are treated with a system of ghost cells. Two layers
of cells between z = 0 and z = 0.0021 R⊙ are used as ﬁxed lower boundary
conditions during the ideal MHD simulation. Open boundary conditions are
imposed at the outer boundary and ﬁnally reﬂective boundary conditions are
set at the x and y boundaries of the simulation box.

Figure 7 shows the values of the radial component of the Lorentz force at
the lower boundary, the function ω, derived from the magnetic conﬁguration,
and the resulting distribution of electron density ne and temperature T . The
Lorentz force is maximum at the location of the ﬂux rope. The map of ω follows
the pattern we have prescribed, being higher around the region of the PIL and
peaking where the ﬂux rope is located. Consequently, the maps of ne and T
show the regions with a higher twisted magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, the position
where the magnetic ﬂux rope sits (compare with Figure 6) presents a density
∼ 10 times higher than its surroundings and a temperature value ∼ 10 times
lower. It is also to be noted that in our model the location, where the ﬂux rope
is relatively cold, is consistent with the observations of AIA in the 211 ˚A band
(Figure 6c) as the location where the ﬂux rope is not visible, since the ﬁlter is
tuned to observe plasma at higher temperatures.

The present initial conditions are clearly out of equilibrium for a number
of reasons. In our simulation the initial plasma β ranges between the two ex-

trema of β ∼ 10−3 (at the ﬂux ropes) and β ∼ 103 (in very conﬁned regions
where the magnetic ﬁeld is less intense). Elsewhere it lies between 10−2 and
10−1. Therefore, the strongest unbalanced force in the initial condition is the
Lorentz force in the magnetic ﬂux rope, which is upwards. At the same time,
the radial proﬁles of density and pressure do not prescribe the balance between
the thermal pressure gradient and the gravity force. However, as addressed in
detail in Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2013a), such unbalance shows eﬀects over
timescales longer than the dynamics triggered by the Lorentz force and therefore
these can be neglected.

5. Results of the MHD Simulation and Comparison with

Observations

We run the MHD simulation starting from the ﬁnal magnetic conﬁguration,
obtained from the time series of NLFF ﬁelds, when the magnetic ﬂux rope is fully
formed, in order to describe the evolution of the ejection of the magnetic ﬂux
rope. The pre-eruptive initial magnetic conﬁguration described in Section 4.1
is obtained from a long term sequence of magnetograms with 1 hour cadence
and thus it cannot indicate the exact magnetic ﬂux rope ejection start time.
Therefore we present the MHD evolution in terms of the time elapsed from the
initial condition and we impose the time of the MHD simulation initial condition
to match the observed CME initiation time. For this speciﬁc simulation, in Table
2 we report the onset of the eruption, i.e. the time of the intial conidition, at

In the upper row some magnetic ﬁeld lines (green lines) and ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines (blue lines)

magnetic ﬂux rope and the red star is the position of the centre of the ﬂux rope at each time.

05:54:40 UT. The initial condition of the MHD simulation is out of equilibrium
and several plasma ﬂows occur at the beginning.

However, the dominant evolution occurs where the ﬂux rope plasma is pushed
upwards by the unbalanced Lorentz force and the ﬂux rope starts erupting. In
order to follow the evolution of the ﬂux rope, we display the simulation from
a line of sight parallel to the y axis. In Figure 8 we show the electron density,
integrated along this line of sight, together with the temperature and velocity
in the z direction, integrated along the line of sight and weighted over ne. We
use as characteristic stages in the evolution the times of t = 0 min, t = 6.04
min, and t = 14.51 min from the eruption onset. Additionally, by considering
the evolution of vz and ω, we manually track the directions of propagation of
the magnetic ﬂux rope and the position of its centre along this direction at each
snapshot of the simulation. This is possible, because the cuts of both vz and ω
along the direction of propagation of the ﬂux rope show a local peak at the ﬂux
rope centre. This direction is represented by the red line and the position of the
red star in Figure 8.

Solar origins of transients

The particle density maps show an expansion and an upwards propagation
of the structures that are initially lying low in the domain. The same motion is
highlighted by the visible change in the magnetic ﬁeld lines. In particular, the
ﬂux rope magnetic ﬁeld lines (represented by the blue lines) show a distinctive
motion, where the magnetic ﬁeld lines are increasingly longer and less twisted
over the evolution.

The evolution of vz describes well this behaviour, where we see a region of
the upward directed velocity that is composed of an elongated region where the
plasma speed is higher and a bow-shaped region ahead that represents the front
of the ejecta. In particular, the elongated region extends along the direction of
propagation of the ﬂux rope and dominates over other motions present in the
domain. The maximum of vz reaches values greater than 500 km s−1 at t =
11.5 min in the MHD simulation. It should be noted that some boundary eﬀects
are visible at the external boundary, where some moderate inﬂow develops over
the course of the simulation. However, the low density of the inﬂowing plasma
makes this eﬀect negligible for the dynamics of the ejection. It is interesting to
notice that no shocks are formed ahead of the ﬂux rope ejection. If we take into
consideration the MHD simulation snapshot at 06:06:43 UT, we ﬁnd that the
plasma speed at the front of the ejection is ∼ 130 km s−1, where the sound speed
is ∼ 300 km s−1. Only behind the propagation of the ﬂux rope, we ﬁnd regions
with supersonic or superalfvenic velocities, where the Mach number is 1.5 or the
Alfv´enic Mach number is ∼ 3.

The evolution of the temperature is signiﬁcantly complex due to the energetics
of the ﬂux rope ejection. As already shown in similar simulations (Pagano,
Mackay, and Poedts, 2014), the numerical resistivity plays a crucial role in
heating the plasma, while expansion and decompression can lead to the cooling of
the plasma in certain regions. As soon as the simulation starts, magnetic energy
is converted into thermal energy and this leads to an overall increase of the
temperature. At the same time, this is not happening everywhere, but only where
the magnetic ﬁeld is initially more twisted, e.g. near the PIL. Subsequently, the
temperature decreases in some regions, but overall stays above the initial one.

Although the detailed comparison between the ﬁnal state of the MHD sim-
ulation and the corresponding state in the region under study poses major
challenges, it is still interesting to carry out a qualitative comparison to have
a global understanding of the weaknesses and strengths of the model. Figure
9a shows a map of the temperature averaged for the electron density along the
line of sight from the top view at t = 14.51 min in the MHD simulation. Figure
9b shows a diﬀerence image between the AIA 211 ˚A pass band at 06:09:00.62
and 05:55:00.62 UT. The latter time is the closest AIA image to the assumed
ﬂux rope ejection time at 05:54:40 UT, the former time is 14.3 minutes after,
which is approximately the duration of the MHD simulation. We ﬁnd that the
region in the center of the ﬁeld of view, where the emission in the AIA 211 ˚A
pass band is enhanced, roughly corresponds to a region in the MHD simulation
where the plasma is heated up on average (to about 4 MK) and that a nearby
location where the emission diminishes corresponds to a relatively cold location
in the MHD simulation. In general, the MHD simulation shows an increase in
temperature, which is consistent with the generally enhanced emission in the

211 ˚A pass band. Also the magnetic ﬁeld lines displayed in Figure 9a describe a
topology with many similarities to the one suggested by the structures in Figure
9b. Examples include the system of loops in the left bottom corner of the ﬁeld
of view and the expanding structures on the top right from the centre of the
image. They roughly correspond to the ﬂux rope location at this time in the
MHD simulation.

Additionally, we have carried out a simple visual comparison of the kinematics
of the ﬂux rope ejection with STEREO observations taken over a time span after
the observed start of the ﬂux rope ejection (at 05:54:40 UT), corresponding to
the duration of the MHD simulation. The visual tracking of the CME in the
STEREO images lets us follow the apex of the expanding loops that initiate the
CME motion (cross points in Figure 10a). In Figure 10a, these radial distances
are compared with the tracked radial distance of the centre of the ﬂux rope
and the front that propagates from its ejection in the MHD simulation. We
ﬁnd a very good agreement of the locations identiﬁed in STEREO observations
with the position of the ﬂux rope front showing that probably the apex of the
loops represents their motion as a consequence of being pushed by the ongoing
ejection and represent the CME front. The same good agreement is found in
Figure 10b, where we compare the speeds of propagation of the ﬂux rope and
the CME front with the speed inferred from STEREO observations. In the MHD
simulation, the CME front accelerates from 100 km s−1 to about 200 km s−1,
while the ﬂux rope moves at 200 km s−1 until the end of the simulation, where
it slows down to 100 km s−1. The points, tracked in STEREO images, always
lie between 150 – 350 km s−1. As we cannot consider this analysis further than a
qualitative comparison, it is interesting to show that the speed of the structure,
predicted by the MHD simulation, is comparable to the speed at which the
structures move in the STEREO observations. At the same time, it seems that
the model underestimates the observed velocity for at least a fraction of the time
of evolution around t = 200 s. There, the observed speed is ∼ 1.5 higher than the
speed of the ﬂux rope centre and the front of the ejecta in the MHD model. This

diﬀerence would be enough to make the plasma ﬂow overcome the sound speed,
thus leading to a shock in the MHD model matching the observation. This may
be a consequence of the diﬀerences between the real atmospheric proﬁle of ρ, T
compared to the inferred and simulated ones used here.

6. Ion Charge State Evolution of CMEs

The ion charge state of the CME plasma, as well as its evolution in the corona,
depends mainly on the following factors: (i) the chemical element to which
the considered ions belong, (ii) the plasma conditions (such as temperatures
and electron densities), and (iii) the bulk velocities of plasma in the corona.
In the previous sections we derived parameters of the erupting plasma and
of the emerging ﬂux rope at distances up to 0.25 R⊙ from both direct EUV
measurements and numerical simulations with the MHD model. In this section,
we investigate the ion charge state evolution of the plasma structures under
study by considering the ratios of carbon, C6+/C5+, and oxygen, O7+/O6+,

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 23

D.Rodkin et al.

and the average charge of iron ions, QFe, which were measured in situ by ACE.
For this purpose it is necessary to analyze how these parameters evolve during
the plasma propagation in the corona at larger distances of several solar radii.
We assume that in the whole space between the solar surface and the frozen-
in region the expanding plasma is in a quasi-stationary state, i.e. the plasma
ionization and recombination time scales are less than the expansion time scale
of the plasma.

Evolution of the ion charge states in the corona can be described by the
following system of continuity equations for a set of ions from the atomic species
of interest in the rest frame of the expanding plasma structure (see, e.g. Ko
et al., 1997):

∂yi
∂t

= Ne (yi−1Ci−1(Te) − yi (Ci(Te) + Ri−1(Te)) + yi+1Ri(Te)) ,

(17)

P

Z
i=0 ni is the relative fraction of the ion with the number density
where yi = ni/
ni in the charge state i, Ne is the electron density, Te is the electron temperature,
Ci is the ionization coeﬃcient rate for the transition from charge state i to i + 1,
and Ri is the total recombination rate (including both radiative and dielectronic
recombination) from the charge state i + 1 to i. For integrating the system of
Equations (17) we used the recombination and ionization rate coeﬃcients Ri and
Ci from the CHIANTI database (an atomic database for emission lines) (Dere,
2007; Dere et al., 2009), where these data are given on the assumption that the
electron speed distribution is Maxwellian.

In order to solve the system of equations, one needs to know the time evolution
of the electron density and temperature, Te(t), Ne(t), in the plasma structure
under study as well as its bulk velocity, v(t). As the plasma parameters, obtained
from the EUV imaging and MHD modeling, are known only in the low corona up
to the distance r0 ≈ 0.25 (in units of R⊙) from the solar surface, we model the
evolution of plasma conditions at larger distances r > r0 analytically, by taking
into account the processes of cooling, heating, and expansion of the plasma, and
solve the system of equations (Equations (17)) for the chosen ion species. As
the initial conditions, we used the plasma parameters derived from the MHD
simulation. In our analysis we separate two speciﬁc regions: the hot ﬂux rope
structure (hereafter referred to as ﬂux rope) and the colder CME leading edge or
compression front (hereafter referred to as CME LE, see Figure 5, Cheng et al.,
2011) surrounding the ﬂux rope. The evolving proﬁles of electron temperatures
and densities for the ﬂux rope and the CME LE plasmas during the acceleration
phase are presented in Figure 11.

As seen in Figure 11, the temperature of the ﬂux rope rises up to 6–9 MK at
the beginning of expansion and then drops down as it moves away, whereas the
CME LE temperature evolution has the reverse trend. This result is consistent
with the recent studies where hot ﬂux rope structures were observed before and
during the eruptive ﬂare and CME events using SDO/AIA data (see Cheng et al.,
2011, 2012; Zhang, Cheng, and Ding, 2012; Cheng et al., 2013). In the work by
Nindos et al. (2015) almost half of the investigated eruptive events contained a
hot ﬂux rope conﬁguration. The high ﬂux rope temperatures in Figure 11 are

plasmas derived from the MHD simulations.

inconsistent with those of the moving CME structure in Figure 5, because the
latter corresponds to the colder outer shell of the CME (see Figures 4a, 4b).
At the same time, the hot ﬂux rope is not visible in Figure 4a due to the fact
that the ﬂare is brighter than its emission. This is in good agreement with the
schematic model of the multi-temperature structure of the CME demonstrated
by Cheng et al. (2011) in their Figure 5.

The electron density at distances r > r0 is taken to have a power law form

consistent with the ﬂux rope evolution for expansion both in length and radius
(see, e.g. Kumar and Rust (1996); Lee et al. (2009)). For the temperature proﬁle
we have used a form similar to the adiabatic relation

Te(r) = Te(r0)

α

Ne(r)
Ne(r0) (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(19)

where the power index α is chosen to be consistent with the in situ measured
values of ion composition parameters. In the case of the adiabatic expansion the
factor α = γ − 1, where γ = 5/3, is the adiabatic index. This simple form of the
temperature proﬁle was used to account for possible heating, which the ejected
plasma usually undergoes long after the eruption (see, e.g. Akmal et al., 2001;
Ciaravella et al., 2001). Smaller values of the index γ are often used in coronal
models to take phenomenologically into account heating mechanisms without
knowledge of heating rates (see also Kumar and Rust, 1996; Lee et al., 2009).

Using Equations (17), we have carried out calculations of ion charge state
evolution of C, O, and Fe ions for the event on 2 August, 2011. A relationship
between cooling rates of plasma by diﬀerent mechanisms, such as the adia-
batic expansion, thermal conductive cooling, and radiative losses, depend on the
plasma parameters and conﬁguration of the erupting structure and varies during
the expansion in the corona. We analyzed and estimated the cooling eﬀectiveness
of these three terms separately for our plasma conditions by considering the

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 25

D.Rodkin et al.

temperature evolution of the ﬂux rope and the CME LE material. It was found
that the most eﬀective cooling factor is the adiabatic expansion. For instance,
at the distance r = 0.5 the fall of temperature for the adiabatic regime prevails
over those of the radiative and conductive cooling by 3–5 times, and at r = 1 it
is up to one order of magnitude and more. Thus, it was shown that at distances
r > 0.25 the adiabatic expansion is the noticeably prevalent the cooling process.
Assuming that the cooling is provided elsewhere only by the adiabatic expan-
sion, we obtained the following frozen-in ion composition parameters: C6+/C5+ =
0.56, O7+/O6+ = 0.017, QFe = 7.4 for the CME LE plasma, and C6+/C5+ =
0.071, O7+/O6+ = 1.46·10−4, QFe = 7.4 for the ﬂux rope structure. These
values are too low in comparison with the in situ observations (see Table 3).
If we then introduce a heating process in the region where the Fe ion state is
frozen-in by decreasing the index α from the adiabatic value 2/3 to 0.1, the
derived value of QFe increases to ∼ 10–11, which is in agreement with in situ
observations. However, in this case the frozen-in ratios C6+/C5+ and O7+/O6+
become noticeably larger by 2–3 times in comparison with the measurements.

In order to explain and to overcome this issue, we assumed that the heating
power depends on the height in the corona. First, our numerical analysis showed
that the ion charge states of C and O ions reach the frozen-in conditions at
distances of about 1–2 R⊙, whereas the frozen-in region of Fe ions begins at
distances of ≈ 4-5 R⊙. The reason is that the recombination time scales of carbon
and oxygen ions, τr = 1/(NeRi), prevail over those of the iron ions. Second, we
considered separately two spatial intervals: the ﬁrst one is from r0 to rh = 1.5
where the frozen-in conditions begin to play a role only for C and O ions, and
the second is from 1.5 R⊙ to the Fe frozen-in region. We then calculated the
evolution of the ion charge states of C and O ions by matching the parameter
α so that to agree with the observational data in the ﬁrst spatial interval. For
the CME LE plasma we adopted the value α =0.35 and found frozen-in values
C6+/C5+ = 2.2 and O7+/O6+ = 0.32. For the ﬂux rope structure α = 0.2, and
C6+/C5+ = 1.77 and O7+/O6+ = 0.14. At the same time, at 1.5 R⊙ we obtained
QFe ≈ 7–8, which is noticeably lower than the measured in situ value.

Using the functional temperature diﬀerence between the proper adiabatic
expansion and the ﬁtted values of the index α for the CME LE plasma and
ﬂux rope, we also estimated the heating power from the coronal source, which
maintains this diﬀerence. It was found that this source acted from r0 to r ≈0.5
and its intensity sharply decreased with distance. The average heating power
for both plasma structures are QCME ≈ 5 · 10−3 erg cm−3 s−1 for the CME LE
plasma and QFR ≈ 6 · 10−3 erg cm−3 s−1 for the ﬂux rope.

In order to match the value QFe with the in situ measurements, we assumed
that in the second interval r > 1.5 R⊙ the parameter QFe increased due to an
additional heating power from the coronal source. We have assumed a tempera-
ture evolution at distances rh ≥1.5 as Te(r) = Th(r/rh)β. Taking the index β =
0.75, we obtained QFe ≈10 for the CME LE plasma and QFe ≈11 for the ﬂux
rope, which is compatible with the in situ observations. Our estimation of the
heating power at the point rh = 1.5 gives Qh ∼ (1 − 2) · 10−5 erg cm−3 s−1.

7. Discussion

In our study, we propose a method to predict the ion charge state of the ICME,
produced by the ﬂare and CME solar event on 2 August 2011, using the SDO/AIA
EUV observations, MHD numerical simulation of the ﬂux rope formation, and
the analytical description of the plasma ion charge state evolution in the corona
up to the frozen-in region. We assume that the ion composition of the ICMEs
does not vary during their propagation in the heliosphere due to the very large
ionization and recombination relaxation times at low plasma density in com-
parison with the travel time. In order to obtain the values of the ion charge
state ratios C6+/C5+ and O7+/O6+ and the average charge QFe close to those
measured in situ, we introduced a heating process, which had diﬀerent rates at
the distances 0.25–1.5 R⊙ and 1.5–5 R⊙.

The results of plasma diagnostics (see Section 3.2) and MHD simulations
suggest that the erupting plasma is heated far from the ﬂare region. Figure
5 shows the temperature dropping to ≈ 1.5 MK at the base of the ejected
structure under consideration, whereas the MHD calculations exhibit noticeably
higher temperatures for the hot ﬂux rope and the colder CME LE plasmas. The
assumption of a heating source above the ﬂare region is of course debatable, but
there is a number of works where the authors performed MHD simulations and
discussed various heating mechanisms in the CME plasma (see, e.g. Lee et al.,
2009; Lynch et al., 2011). At the same time, the work of Zhang, Cheng, and
Ding (2012) shows that in some cases the heating of the ﬂux rope can start
simultaneously with the ejection, as they observe the appearance of hot channel
signatures at the earliest stage of the slow rise of the ejection of a magnetic ﬂux
rope.

Reinard, Lynch, and Mulligan (2012) carried out a numerical simulation of ion
composition for two ICMEs (magnetic clouds), detected by STEREO and ACE
on 21–23 May 2007, using the Magnetohydrodynamics-on-A-Sphere (MAS) and
ARC7 ideal 2.5D MHD models, described earlier by Lynch et al. (2011). Both
models took into account ﬁeld-aligned thermal conduction, radiative losses, and
coronal heating from the ﬂare site during the initiation and expansion of a ﬂux
rope in the corona up to distances of more than 10 R⊙. As it follows from their
results, the key question in the prediction of the ICME ion composition by the
numerical MHD modeling is a correct deﬁnition of the ratio between heating
and cooling processes acting on the erupting plasma in the corona. In both
models, described by Lynch et al. (2011), heating is introduced as the dominating
factor not depending on real conditions in the source. Thus, they obtained that
the slower CMEs became hotter than the faster ones, which contradicts the
observations. On the contrary, we use a 3D MHD model to determine the plasma
parameters of the ejecta on the initial stage of the ﬂux rope ejection and ﬁt the
results with the EUV measurements by selecting the initial parameters of the
simulation.

Our consideration refers to the case when the ICME parameters correspond to
the apex of the CME. Though, in some cases the presence of the nearby coronal
holes (CHs) producing high-speed streams can seriously inﬂuence the appearance
and parameters of the ICME near Earth (Gopalswamy et al., 2009a,b; Mohamed

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 27

D.Rodkin et al.

et al., 2012; M¨akel¨a et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2012; Gopalswamy et al., 2013). An
interaction of the CME with a high-speed stream from the nearby coronal hole
can deﬂect the CME from its initial direction, which results in the shifting of the
arrival time ahead or behind the time, predicted by the kinematic models, and
can change other solar wind parameters. We suppose that the ion composition
parameters in the collisionless heliosphere are not inﬂuenced by such interaction
and can be used for the source identiﬁcation, but these cases are worth to be
specially studied.

It should be noted, that our model is rather simplistic and idealized, as it does
not reproduce some important details of the CME formation, such as laminar and
turbulent features of the evolution visible in observations. Energy dissipation via
electric resistivity, heat conduction, viscosity, and radiation should be especially
taken into consideration during the early phase of the evolution in the dense
corona. The used ideal one ﬂuid MHD approach has a limited applicability in
the case of the observed small scale and fast variations. Moreover, the numerical
ideal MHD modelling, we have conducted in this work, does not take into account
the terms in the energy equation that play a role in the coronal dynamics.
Thermal conduction can be responsible of diﬀusing heat in the domain, even if
Pagano et al. (2007) and Pagano, Mackay, and Poedts (2014) showed that it is
largely inhibited inside the ﬂux rope during the CME propagation. Dimension-
less scaling and the relative importance of corresponding terms in the energy
balance equations is not quite clear and needs more investigation for better
understanding of the overall situation. Finally, a more accurate treatment for
the eﬀect of magnetic resistivity on the amount of magnetic energy converted
into heating would require a much higher spatial resolution.

8. Summary and Conclusion

We presented a complex study of a series solar wind transients registered by
ACE on 4 – 7 August 2011 and their solar sources, ﬂares and CMEs, which
occurred on 2, 3 and 4 August 2011 in AR 11261. These events produced two
shocks with sheaths and two ICMEs of the MC type, as identiﬁed by the RC list.
The analysis of the ion charge state of the solar wind revealed three transients
with enhanced temperature-dependent ratios C6+/C5+ , O7+/O6+ and a mean
charge of iron ions QFe, which can be associated with hot plasma released in
the coronal sources. The ﬁrst transient, determined from the ion composition,
coincided with the ﬁrst ICME (Table 1), whereas the two others preceded the
second ICME. The shift in time between transients 2, 3, and the second ICME
may be probably caused by interaction between CME 2 and 3. Simulations with
the WSA-Enlil cone model showed that the third CME of 4 August surpassed
the second CME of 3 August at a distance from the Sun of about 0.6 AU.

We studied in detail the formation of the ﬁrst CME of 2 August, using the
SDO/AIA images in 211˚A and numerical simulations using NLFF and MHD
modeling. The images of the eruptive structures in diﬀerent SDO/AIA spectral
channels were used for diagnostics of the outﬂow plasma by means of the DEM
analysis. From the observational data it was found that in the event of 2 August

SOLA: Rodkin_Tansients_arXiV2.tex; 20 November 2021; 16:59; p. 28

Solar origins of transients

the temperature of the plasma during its visible expansion from 0.1 to 0.13 R⊙
decreased from 2.7 to 1.7 MK and the density from 1 · 109 to 5 · 108 cm−3. These
values are lower than those obtained by modeling for the apex, and correspond
to the legs of the eruption shell. This conﬁrms that heating is more eﬀective in
the upper part of the expanding structure.

The initiation of the CME of 2 August 2011 was simulated numerically, using
a combination of the NLFF magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation model with a 3D MHD
model of the expanding ﬂux rope, specially suited for the given case. The results
of the simulation and comparison with the EUV measurements demonstrate that
the general topology of the magnetic ﬁeld matched the visible loop structure,
whereas the ﬂux rope was formed along the polarity inversion line and was
pushed upwards by the unbalanced Lorentz force. The maximal speed was below
the sound speed of 300 km s−1, thus, the model did not predict creation of a
shock wave ahead of the ﬂux rope ejection that was seen in the observations.
The MHD simulation showed a temperature of ∼ 4 MK in the CME apex, which
coincides with an enhancement of radiation in the 211˚A channel. In the relative
time scale starting at the moment of the ﬂux rope raise-up, the simulated height
time dependence of the CME structure up to the heights of 0.25 R⊙ agrees well
with the observations of STEREO in 171˚A at the limb, the diﬀerence in speed
is within the measurement errors ± 65 km s−1.

Based on the results of the observations and numerical simulation, the ion
composition of CME1 in the frozen-in region in the event of 2 August 2011
was calculated with some assumptions about heating and cooling processes. The
calculated values of the temperature-dependent ion ratios and the mean charge of
iron agree with those measured in situ, under the assumption that the expanding
plasma was heated by an additional source. The average heating power decreased
with height from ∼ (5 − 6) · 10−3 erg cm−3 s−1 at rh ≈ 0.5 − 1.5 to ∼ (1 − 2) ·
10−5 [erg cm−3 s−1] at rh ≈ 1.5 − 5.

In conclusion, our analysis of the ion composition of CMEs enables to disclose
a relationship between parameters of solar wind transients and properties of
their solar sources, which opens new possibilities to validate and improve the
solar wind forecasting models.
