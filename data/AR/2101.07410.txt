ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the phenomenon of support and resistance levels (SR levels)
in ﬁnancial time series, which act as temporary price barriers that reverses price
trends. We develop a heuristic discovery algorithm for this purpose, to discover and
evaluate SR levels for intraday price series. Our simple approach discovers SR levels
which are able to reverse price trends statistically signiﬁcantly. Asset price entering
SR levels with higher number of price bounces before are more likely to bounce
on such SR levels again. We also show that the decay aspect of the discovered SR
levels as decreasing probability of price bounce over time. We conclude SR levels
are features in ﬁnancial time series are not explained simply by AR(1) processes,
stationary or otherwise; and that they contribute to the temporary predictability
and stationarity of the investigated price series.

1.

Introduction

Support and resistance levels (SR levels) are prices in a ﬁnancial time series where it
is believed that price trends are likely to stop and reverse (Osler 2000). SR levels are
well known and frequently used within the retail trading circle as a form of technical
analysis to inform trading decisions (Taylor and Allen 1992). Technical analysis is a class
of methods which involves the analysis of historical data to inform trading decisions in
the present. Traditionally it incorporates data such as price trends and trading activities,
but modern advancements in data collection has opened potentially useful data sources
such as twitter and news feed (Bharathi, Geetha, and Sathiynarayanan 2017). Unlike
fundamental analysis in which the intrinsic value of a ﬁnancial asset is evaluated in
terms of economics and/or politics, technical analysis focuses solely on exploitable price
patterns in the past.

The use of technical analysis for trading decisions can be dated as far back to the mid-
19th century (Lef`evre 1923), when it was better known as tape reading. Ticker tapes
were once in use to display current stock prices and volume, and tape reading refers to
the analysis of the information on a ticker tape. Fast forward to the modern-day, retail
traders (individual investors investing in retail platforms) mainly understand technical

analysis to be the analysis of historic price series to predict future price movements.
A common way of applying technical analysis is to perform calculations on a rolling
window of historic prices to produce a numerical indicator (Leigh, Purvis, and Ragusa
2002) (Lebaron 2000). This indicator can then be used to inform trading decisions, for
example if the trader should invest in a particular ﬁnancial asset.

Technical analysis by nature go against the well established eﬃcient market hypothesis
(EMH) (Melkiel 1989). The EMH states that asset prices fully reﬂect all available infor-
mation, and that as a direct consequence it is impossible to generate returns in excess of
risk free returns on a consistent basis by analysing asset prices only. There is currently
no consensus on this conundrum in the academic community, as both opposing sides
have equally numerous and convincing academic evidence to support their claims. For
example, a recent review (Park and Irwin 2007) on studies of technical analysis has
found overwhelmingly positive results on its proﬁtability. On the other hand, a paper
(Melkiel 2003) defends the EMH by invalidating its critics and concludes that the stock
markets are not as predictable as they claim.

The most important philosophical foundation as to why technical analysis can be prof-
itable is that retail traders believe history repeats itself, in the form of market ineﬃ-
ciencies which can be repeatedly exploited. The prevalence of high frequency trading
in the past decades (Menkveld 2013), which is mostly dependent on analysing order
book information, is a testament to the eﬃcacy of technical analysis. For this paper, we
maintain a neutral stance on this subject and use methods from both sides to validate
our ﬁndings.

Veriﬁcation of and optimization of the proﬁt of technical indicators is in continuous re-
search. An example of such an indicator is the Bollinger bands (Bollinger 1992), in which
there were substantial research eﬀorts (Lento, Gradojevic, and Wright 2007; Leung and
Chong 2003; Kabasinskas and Macys 2010; Williams 2006) since its publication. Despite
interests in understanding technical indicators in general, research on SR levels are few
and far between. We postulate that the diﬃculty of establishing a universal technical
indicator due to its subjective nature could be the main reason for this. Although re-
search on market micro-structure related to SR levels such as price barriers (Bourghelle
and Cellier 2009) and price clustering (Chiao and Wang 2009) can be found, the earliest
account that veriﬁes the predictive capability of SR levels is documented by Osler in
2000 (Osler 2000), who have stated that “the speciﬁc conclusion that exchange rates
tend to stop trending at support and resistance levels has no precedent in the academic
literature”.

From a market micro-structure perspective, the root cause of SR levels can be attributed
to a large volume of limit orders stacked at certain price levels. Indeed, economists have
concluded the existence of SR levels is due to stacked limit orders at certain price levels
(Chiao and Wang 2009). Limit orders are buy/sell orders of a ﬁnancial asset which are
executed only if pre-determined prices are met; whereas market orders are orders which
are executed immediately at the current price. SR levels are results of an imbalance
order ﬂow at certain price levels (Osler 2001). This order ﬂow is an intricate interplay
between limit orders and market orders.

Osler concluded that published SR levels by ﬁnancial ﬁrms between 1996 to 1998 has
statistically signiﬁcant ability to predict trend interruptions (Osler 2000); and that their
predictive abilities can last up to 5 business days after publishing. Garzarelli et al. (2014)
have also investigated the bounce probability of SR levels discovered in the tick data

2

for 9 stocks in the London Stock Exchange in 2002, and concluded that prices tend
to re-bounce than cross price values which are determined to be SR levels. Our work
centres around the evaluation framework of Garzarelli et al. (2014), and contributes to
the literature by proposing a heuristic sequential algorithm for SR level detection in
Section 2, investigates the temporal eﬀect of the detected SR levels in Section 4 and
if our ﬁndings occur naturally in a theoretical eﬃcient market in Section 5. Section 6
concludes this paper and discusses future work.

2. Methodology

2.1. Deﬁnitions

At the time of writing, no clear mathematical deﬁnition for SR levels can be found in
the literature. Qualitative description of SR levels on the other hand are well established
in technical analysis manuals and there are little diﬀerences in their deﬁnitions (Osler
2000). For example a standard technical analysis reference states that “Support levels
indicate the price where the majority of investors believe that prices will move higher,
and resistance levels indicate the price at which a majority of investors feel prices will
move lower.” (Achelis 2001). Garzarelli et al. (2014) evaluates the eﬃcacy of SR levels
using a probabilistic approach but also have a qualitative deﬁnition. As far as a general
approach is concerned, recent minima and maxima are as good approximates of SR
levels as any (Osler 2000).

These deﬁnitions, though form the basis of our discovery algorithm in the later sections,
are unsatisfying mathematically and are not concrete enough to work with. To carry
out our investigations in the subsequent sections, we propose the following deﬁnitions
for support and resistance level in a discrete time framework:

Deﬁnition 2.1. Support Level is an interval ra, bs P R such that if xt P ra, bs, then
ppxt`δ ą bq ą ppxt`δ ă aq for all δ P t1, . . . , ωu.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Resistance Level an interval ra, bs P R such that if xt P ra, bs, then
ppxt`δ ą bq ă ppxt`δ ă aq for all δ P t1, . . . , ωu.

Our proposed deﬁnitions acknowledge the varying width of an SR level with an arbitrary
interval ra, bs, as well as its temporary nature by specifying an arbitrary value ω for the
length of its existence. The choice to specify an interval for an SR level is twofold:
relaxation of strict price levels such as using SR zones instead of SR levels are popular
among technical traders, and such relaxation allows more price bounces to be observed
for any interval which helps in detecting SR levels. In section 2.2, we argue that the
optimal choice of interval width for our discovery algorithm is determined by the average
price increment, which is in turn related to the resolution of the price series. For very
high frequency price series, or in a theoretical continuous context, choosing the interval
width to be 0 may be suitable. However, our deﬁnitions do not directly address the
supply and demand imbalance in the order book which is one of the root causes of SR
levels (Osler 2001), but is suﬃcient for our subsequent analysis where only the asset
price series is concerned.

Next, we deﬁne the bounce and penetration event for an SR level. A bounce on a support

3

(resistance) level is deﬁned as the price entering the level’s interval from its upper (lower)
boundary and then exiting it through the upper (lower) boundary, without going below
the lower (upper) boundary. We deﬁne penetration of a support (resistance) level as the
price entering its region from the upper (lower) boundary and then exiting through the
lower (upper) boundary. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 display support levels with a price bounce
and a price penetration respectively, with the dotted lines denoting the upper and lower
boundary of the support level.

Figure 2.1. Support level with a single bounce

Figure 2.2. Support level with penetration

In order to evaluate the strength of an SR level following our proposed deﬁnitions, we
deﬁne the probability of bouncing, which for a support level is

ppbq “

ppxt`δ ą bq
ppxt`δ ă aq ` ppxt`δ ą bq

,

and for a resistance level is

ppbq “

ppxt`δ ă aq
ppxt`δ ă aq ` ppxt`δ ą bq

,

where xt P ra, bs and δ P t1, . . . , ωu. This probability of bouncing is conditional on price
exiting the SR level, and is essential for our investigation in the subsequent sections.
Note that the bounce probability deﬁned here holds true for the particular price level

within this time interval. We also refer the strength of an SR level to be its ppbq value;
i.e. the higher the ppbq value for an SR level, the stronger it is, therefore the better its
ability to reverse price trends.

2.2. Discovery & Evaluation Algorithm

At the time of writing, no existing discovery algorithm of SR levels is documented in the
academic literature. Osler evaluated SR levels published by ﬁnancial institutions (Osler
2000), and Garzarelli et al. (2014) has not explicitly stated how their evaluated SR levels
are discovered. The algorithm proposed in this section follows a rolling window approach
commonly used in technical analysis (Chang et al. 2018), and simply identiﬁes local
minima and local maxima as support and resistance levels respectively. We acknowledge
that there are many methods for discovering SR levels in the trading circle and that
therefore the discovery algorithm proposed here is one of all possible discovery methods.

A rolling window approach entails that a pre-speciﬁed period of immediate historic price
series being analysed by the algorithm at every time point. Given a rolling window with
prices series Xt “ xτ :τ Ptt´i,t´i`1,...,tu, where τ is the time index and i the rolling window
length. We also refer to rolling windows with length i minutes to be an i minute lag
window for the remainder of this paper. Following our deﬁnitions of an SR level earlier,
we choose for a rolling window, a support level to be min Xt ˘ γ and a resistance level
to be max Xt ˘ γ, where γ is the level width parameter. We follow the approach of
Garzarelli et al. (Garzarelli et al. 2014), which accommodates diﬀerent resolution of
price series, by choosing γ to be the average price increment of the entire price series
deﬁned as

∆pxtq “

T ´ 1

Tÿ

t“2

|xt ´ xt´1|,

(1)

where T is the last time index of the price series. We ﬁnd that using this approach yields
ppbq “ 0.5 consistently for random walk simulations which serves as a good benchmark,
and that a higher γ would inﬂate ppbq while a lower γ would deﬂate ppbq.

With the SR levels of a rolling window identiﬁed, we can then count the number of
bounces there are for this pair of SR levels. In the case of a support level, its number of
bounces Sb can be determined by the number of crosses on the upper boundary of the
support level ¯S “ min Xt ` γ of each price movement divided by 2; or in mathematical
terms, the number of times ¯S is between xτ ´1 and xτ for τ P tt ´ i, t ´ i ` 1, . . . , tu
divided by 2, where i denote the rolling window length. Thus, the number of support
bounces

They can be calculated at each time step t from the price series rolling window. The
parameter γ denotes the level width parameter.

This way of discovering SR levels is a heuristic approach and has some overly simplifying
assumptions. It assumes SR levels do not last longer than the length of the rolling
window, and therefore older price series does not contribute to the discovery of SR
levels. We know this to be false as SR levels only become obsolete once the limit orders
stacked at the price level are either executed or cancelled. It also assume there are only
one pair of SR levels at any given time. This is also likely untrue as limit orders can
be stacked with varying quantity at diﬀerent price levels, leading to multiple SR levels
with diﬀerent strengths. Another caveat of this approach is that it strictly chooses SR
levels to be the window maximum and minimum, eﬀectively ignoring newly formed SR
levels which are neither the maximum nor the minimum within the rolling window.

For the purpose of observing ppb|bprevq described in the next section, the discovery
procedure ceases to operate temporarily when price enters an SR level. This ensures
that the discovered SR levels remain static, as the price could achieve a new minimum
or maximum of the rolling window without penetrating the SR level. If the discovery
procedure continues operating, a new minimum (maximum) would create a new lower
(upper) boundary for the support (resistance) level, and thus erroneously reducing the
probability of penetration. Once a bounce or penetration is determined, this is recorded
along with the number of previous price bounces there has been on the SR level (bprev),
and the discovery procedure resumes process normally.

2.3. Bounce Probability Bayesian Framework

Retail traders believe that multiple price trend reversals on the same SR level indicate
its strength. A framework to evaluate the conditional probability of a bounce ppb|bprevq
on an SR level given bprev previous bounces on the same SR level was developed for this
purpose (Garzarelli et al. 2014). In this framework, b denotes the binary variable where
b “ 1 represents a bounce event and b “ 0 represents a penetration event, after asset
price enters a predetermined SR level; and we impose no time limit for this SR level
exit event to occur. This probability is also a method that measures the memory eﬀect
of ﬁnancial time series (Sewell 2011). To measure whether SR levels tend to interrupt
price trends, we observe price behaviour within the SR levels.

The framework (Garzarelli et al. 2014) to estimate ppb|bprevq continues as follows. As-
suming the discovered SR levels are statistically identical and independent, and denoting

‚ bprev as the number of previous bounces of an SR level,

‚ nbprev as the total number of price bounce events given bprev,

‚ kbprev as the total number of price penetration events given bprev,

‚ and Nbprev “ nbprev ` kbprev as the total number of times price exits given bprev.

6

Then ppb|bprevq can be modelled using the method of Bayesian inference. Assuming
that nbprev follows a Bernoulli process, as there are only two outcomes when the price
enters an SR level - bounce or penetration, we can deﬁne the probability of success
corresponding to a price bounce given the number of previous bounces of an SR level,
as

π “ ppb|bprevq.

By assuming an uninformative uniform prior for π such that

and modelling of observed nbprev and Nbprev with a binomial likelihood

The uniform prior is in fact a special case of the Beta distribution and can therefore be
treated as a conjugate prior to a Beta posterior with respect to a binomial likelihood.
As the posterior of π can be written as

3. Statistical Evidence

This section investigates the extend at which the hypothesised SR levels inﬂuence future
price, which manifests as a memory eﬀect. In particular, we investigate the relationship
of the strength of an SR level and the number of previous price bounces it has. The result
of a positively correlated relationship from analysing price series in 2018 in the foreign
exchange market, London Stock Exchange and the commodity market, is consistent
with the analysis by Garzarelli et al. (2014) on high frequency price series on 9 selected
stocks in the London Stock Exchange in 2002. In addition, we obtain evidence for the
temporal decay in this bounce probability and also show that simulated time series from
AR1 processes are unable to reproduce similar results.

The minute intraday price series in 2018 for 3 ﬁnancial assets are analysed: 1) the Euro-
US dollar conversion rate (EURUSD) in the foreign exchange market, 2) the Lloyds
Banking Group PLC (LLOY) equity in London Stock Exchange, and 3) the Brent Crude
Oil (BRENT) commodity in the global commodity market. These ﬁnancial assets are
the most traded assets (Hasbrouck and Levich 2017) from their respective ﬁnancial

7

markets, with 372,607, 127,606 and 307,678 entries respectively after removing entries
without trading activities. Note that stocks are only traded for 8 hours during trading
days, and contributes to the vastly lower number of the LLOY price entries. The minute
intraday price series required for analysis can be obtained for free from the following

3.1. Estimated Bounce Probability

The estimated ppb|bprevq values evaluated by applying the discovery and evaluation
algorithms described in Section 2.2 are presented here. In essence, we determine local
minima and maxima to be local support and resistance levels, then count the number
of bounces these levels have in the recent past, and ﬁnally observe if prices in the future
bounce or penetrate these levels. This procedure is carried out throughout the entire
price series and results are then aggregated using the Bayesian estimation framework
described in Section 2.3.

Estimated ppb|bprevq values represents the probability of price bouncing oﬀ an SR level
again given the number of previous bounces, and estimated values other than 0.5 sug-
gests predictability in the price series. The higher this estimate is, the more likely price
is going to bounce again on the discovered SR level. Since we are investigating the
ability of SR level to reverse price trends, we expect the estimated ppb|bprevq values to
be higher than the baseline 0.5. To demonstrate this price reversal ability as a memory
eﬀect in the price series, we also estimate ppb|bprevq for a shuﬄed returns price series
for comparison. The conﬁdence intervals in this section are constructed using a width
of 1 standard deviation on each side which only represents a 68% conﬁdence interval.
This is done to improve the readability of the charts due to some large standard devia-
tions estimations. Doubling the width of the conﬁdence intervals in the produced charts
gives 95% conﬁdence intervals and may serve as a better comparison of the estimated
ppb|bprevq values between the original price series and the shuﬄed return price series.

Figure 3.1 displays the estimated ppb|bprevq, in which the results for the shuﬄed returns
series is superimposed with the results for the original prices for comparison. Directing
our attention to the estimated ppb|bprevq for the original series, it is seen that bprev
is positively correlated with ppb|bprevq. This result coincides with the stylised fact of
multiple price trend reversals of an SR level conﬁrms its strength; and provides evidence
for the self-reinforcement hypothesis in the behavioural ﬁnance perspective (Menkhoﬀ
1997) where traders collectively bet on price trend reversals at SR levels with a high
number of previous bounces. Furthermore, the estimated ppb|bprevq is higher for the
original price series than that of the shuﬄed returns series. There is also no visually
discernible diﬀerence in price behaviour between support and resistance levels. This
comparison with the shuﬄed returns series provides evidence for a memory eﬀect in
the price series, at least in the short term. Lastly, having bprev “ 8 in the shuﬄed
returns series is an occurrence so rare that there are only 16 recorded such SR level
entry events. This small sample size has also aﬀected the ppb|bprevq estimation and its
standard deviation. Due to this, it might become diﬃcult to determine statistically if
ppb|bprev “ 8q is indeed higher in the original price series, but it is logical to assume
ppb|bprev “ 8q converges to 0.5 for a perfect random walk which has no memory.

Figure 3.1. Estimated ppb|bprevq for EURUSD (60-minute lag window). The conﬁdence intervals are
constructed using a width of 1 standard deviation on each side.

We perform the same procedure on a longer lag window to demonstrate SR levels
exist also on other timeframes. Figure 3.2 displays the results for the EURUSD 2018
price series but applying the discovery and evaluation algorithms using a lag window
of 240 minutes. The results in general are similar to the results in the previous section
for a lag window of 60 minutes: higher number of previous bounces predicts a higher
probability of bouncing again. There is however, a decrease in the estimated ppb|bprevq,
which conﬁrms the temporary nature of SR levels, i.e. the strength of SR levels decreases
with time. There is also a decrease in the number of events recorded, up to half as many
as the 60-minute lag window results; and is more prominent for lower bprev values. This
is a consequence of using a large lag window and that SR levels identiﬁed in a longer
time frame simply has more opportunities for price bounces to occur, leading to less SR
levels with a small number of previous bounces.

are constructed using a width of 1 standard deviation on each side.

Results for LLOY using a 60 and 240 minute lag window are displayed in Figure 3.3 and
3.4 respectively; the results for BRENT using a 60 and 240 minute lag window are dis-
played in Figure 3.5 and 3.6 respectively. The observed bounce behaviour is also similar
for the LLOY and BRENT price series, and provides evidence for the universal exis-
tence of SR levels across asset classes. We again observe a positive correlation between
an SR level’s bounce probability and its number of previous bounces. As a side note, the
LLOY price series has a length of approximately a third of the length of the EURUSD
and BRENT series due to its market opening hours, therefore the estimated ppb|bprevq

of recorded bounce events.

higher bprev values. This unexpected deviation however can be explained by a smaller

sample size, as is also indicated by a larger standard deviation. A close to 0.5 ppb|bprevq
is theoretically in agreement with martingale models, and suggests that this class of
models may not be adequate for capturing this eﬀect in the actual price series.

3.2. Statistical Testing

Garzarelli et al. (2014) have proposed the use of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show
that the estimated ppb|bprevq for the original and the shuﬄed returns price series are
from diﬀerent distributions (Garzarelli et al. 2014). They have also conducted a chi-
squared test of independence for the estimated ppb|bprevq for bprev P t1, 2, 3, 4u, and
concluded that ppb|bprevq is statistically dependent on bprev for the original price series.
For the purpose of showing the price series is predictable, which essentially contradicts
the eﬃcient market hypothesis, statistically signiﬁcant results of deviation from the
baseline of ppb|bprevq “ 0.5 is suﬃcient. To this end, we would like to show that the
estimated ppb|bprevq is higher for the original price series than the shuﬄed returns price
series. A modiﬁed permutation test is used to estimate the expected probability of a
higher bounce probability in the original than the shuﬄed returns series. We deﬁne this
expectation to be Λ and it can be written as

,

(2)

where popb|bprevq and pspb|bprevq refer to the probability of bouncing in the original and
the shuﬄed returns price series respectively. This expectation can be numerically esti-
mated using Monte Carlo simulations by making the popb|bprevq ą pspb|bprevq compari-
son using a large number of price series with diﬀerently shuﬄed return. The procedures
can be repeated for other lag window lengths, assets and support/resistance/combined
levels.

A down side of this approach is that it is computationally expensive to apply the
discovery and evaluation algorithms in Section 2.2 to a large number of price series.
Therefore it is of interest to use as few shuﬄed returns series as possible, as long as it
is justiﬁed to do so. From the previous section we see that the number of recorded SR
entry events for bprev “ 8 can be very low for a shuﬄed returns series. Therefore perhaps
the main concern of only using a small number of shuﬄed returns series is the instability
of the estimation of pspb|bprev “ 8q. The worst case for our investigation would be the

This is because the price series is the shortest, and leads to a very low number of
events for estimation when coupled this with a long lag window. However, we ﬁnd that
the median of the estimated pspb|bprev “ 8q for LLOY stabilises after aggregating the
results of 30 or more shuﬄed returns series. The median also converges to approximately
0.5, which is an expected result and conﬁrms our random walk assumption. Figure 3.7
shows the evolution of this median over the number of shuﬄed returns series used for
LLOY with a lag window of 240 minutes. In addition, since we would also like suﬃcient
precision for signiﬁcance level testing, we decide to evaluate 1000 shuﬄed returns series.

Figure 3.7. Aggregated Median of Estimated pspb|bprev “ 8q for LLOY

Table 3.1 displays the estimated Λ (Equation 2) for support, resistance and combined
level, for bprev P t1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8u. The large majority of the estimated Λ are larger
than 0.95, providing statistical evidence that the price series do have higher probability
of bouncing on an SR level than their shuﬄed returns counterparts; the implication of
this conclusion is that there is indeed a memory eﬀect in the price series. However, due
to LLOY having a shorter price series, a comparatively smaller number of SR level entry
events with a high value of bprev is discovered from its shuﬄed returns series. This leads
to very small Λ estimates for the LLOY price series with 0.226 being the smallest. We
are therefore apprehensive about making the same conclusion for the SR levels in LLOY
for bprev values of 6, 7 and 8. Given the statistical evidence, we conclude SR levels have
a higher probability of SR level bouncing in the LLOY price series than in the shuﬄed
returns series up to and including bprev “ 5.

4. Temporal Decay of SR Levels

Results in the previous section show a smaller bounce probability when applying the
discovery algorithm using a 240 minute lag window, instead of a 60 minute lag window
for the original series. So far our analysis which corroborate the work of Garzarreli et
al. (Garzarelli et al. 2014), have not investigated the temporary nature of SR levels
(though Osler (Osler 2000) has concluded that SR levels can last up to at least 5
business days). In this section, we extend the knowledge of SR levels in the literature
by considering the temporal aspect of SR levels on an intraday basis. The duration of
which individual SR levels exist are non-deterministic and have varying lengths. We
therefore investigates if and how the memory eﬀect decays over time by aggregating
results over all discovered SR levels. We obtain evidence for the decay in memory eﬀect

in terms of bounce probability in the macro scale by varying lag window lengths, and in
the micro scale by measuring time from last bounce. The decay behaviour seems to be
unique depending on the particular asset, which we attribute to the general price trend
of the asset in 2018 and to the unique characteristic of the asset.

4.1. Macro Decay

We refer the macro decay in the SR level memory eﬀect as the negative correlation
observed for SR level bounce probabilities and the lag window length used for the
discovery of the SR levels. To observe this decay directly, we compare the estimated
ppb|bprevq for lag windows from 30 minutes to 1440 minutes (1 day) in 30 minutes
increments. It is anticipated that the use of a large lag window such as 1440 minutes
gives a small number of discovered SR levels with a higher number of previous bounces,
which in turn leads to inaccurate estimations. To overcome this, we focus our attention
only on SR levels with 1 to 4 previous bounces. Figure 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 display estimated
ppb|bprevq over diﬀerent lag window lengths and overlay bprev values from 1 to 4 for
comparison.

As expected a general downward trend for the estimated ppb|bprevq against lag window
length is observed in Figure 4.1. This shows that previous bounces of an SR level over
a longer time frame become less eﬀective at predicting future bounces. For EURUSD,
previous bounces of an SR level predicts future bounces most eﬀectively with short lag
windows, but we also observe that SR levels with a higher number of previous bounces
decay in predictive ability the slowest. For example, the estimated bounce probability
for SR levels with 1 previous bounce decays to 0.5 at approximately a 350 minute lag
window length, whereas SR levels with 4 previous decays to the same level at a much
longer 900 minute lag window length. The comparatively quicker decay of support levels
to a bounce probability of less than 0.5 can be attributed to a general bear market in
2018 for EURUSD.

The decay behaviour of the LLOY asset is very diﬀerent than that of EURUSD. Figure
4.2 shows that most bounce probabilities do not decay to 0.5 or below. This suggests

13

Figure 4.1. EURUSD Lag Window Length Analysis.

the memory eﬀect of SR levels are more persistent in the stock markets. In fact, it
is diﬃcult to determine, from inspecting Figure 4.2 alone, if the memory eﬀect of SR
levels decays at all for the LLOY asset. Again, a somewhat observable decay in bounce
probability for the support level compared to the resistance level can be attributed to
the general bear market for LLOY in 2018. A general decay in bounce probability for
longer lag window lengths is observed for BRENT in Figure 4.3, which is similar to that
of EURUSD. However, it would seem the memory eﬀect for the SR levels with only
1 previous bounce decays very rapidly to 0.5 at lag window lengths of no longer than
300 minutes; it also decays to lower than 0.5 which suggests not only does 1 previous
bounce not predict future bounces, it actually predicts penetrations. This could be a
characteristic of the BRENT asset, but can also be attributed to an extreme bear market
in the ﬁnal quarter of 2018 for the BRENT asset, as this feature is more prominent for
support levels than it is for resistance levels.

4.2. Micro Decay

Next we investigate the decay in bounce probability as time increases from the previous
bounce of an SR level, referred as micro decay in this section. To this end, we measure
the time from previous bounce of an SR level for every SR level entry event and construct
logistic regression models to describe the relationship between price bounces and time
from previous bounce. This is done separately for bprev values from 1 to 8, and for a

BRENT Lag Window Length Analysis.

lag window length of 600 minutes. We have picked this particular length of lag window
(600 minutes) because most estimated bounce probability manages to decay to 0.5 in
the macro scale in the 600 minute lag window as described in the previous section,
and therefore allows us to study the micro decay. On the contrary, if we have picked
a 60 minute lag window length, no micro decay can be observed as we have already
shown there is minimal macro decay within a 60 minute time frame. The logistic model
assumes the following form:

¯

´

log

Y
1 ´ Y

“ a ` bX,

where Y represents the binary variable for price exiting SR level events (1 for bounce
events, 0 for penetration events), X the time from previous bounce and a, b the model
parameters. The inclusion of the intercept parameter a serves as a baseline bounce prob-
ability, but we are most interested in the b parameter which indicates the relationship
between bounce probability and time from previous bounce of an SR level. Non-linear
transformations of X have also been modelled but they do not improve model ﬁt.

The estimated regression parameters for the EURUSD price series are displayed in Table
4.1. It can be observed that not all estimated paramters are statistically signiﬁcant.
However, the signs of the estimated parameters are consistent with previous results and
our expectations. The estimated values for a are positive, implying a baseline bounce
probability of higher than 0.5; this number increases with bprev which is consistent
with our previous conclusion of multiple SR level bounces conﬁrms its strength. The
estimated b values are negative, implying a negative correlation with bounce probability
and time from previous bounce; conﬁrming our suspicion of a micro decay in bounce
probability. Despite both of these observations, the inference of the existence of a micro
decay is only supported by models for bprev “ 4, 5 in which both estimated parameters
are statistically signiﬁcant. The comparatively smaller sample size for bprev “ 6, 7, 8
regression models contributes to the lack of statistically signiﬁcant parameter estimates,
and this also holds true for the LLOY and BRENT price series.

The estimated regression parameters for the LLOY price series are displayed in Table
4.2. Similar to the result for the EURUSD price series, all estimated a values are posi-
tive and all estimated b values are negative, which are consistent with previous results
and within our expectations. Although the macro decay in bounce probability is con-
servatively speaking inconclusive as seen in Figure 4.2, the negative estimated b values

However, the model for bprev “ 4 has both estimated parameters to be statistically

of a micro decay.

5. SR Levels in AR(1) Processes

A simpliﬁed interpretation of the eﬃcient market hypothesis is that ﬁnancial time series
should follow a random walk (or Brownian motion in continuous time) like pattern. This
feature implies future prices cannot be predicted using historical data. Auto-regressive
processes with unit roots simulate this feature, and thus studying SR levels in simulated
auto-regressive processes allows us to determine if SR levels naturally exist in eﬃcient
markets. We investigate this line of argument in this section by modelling the price series
with auto-regressive processes with 1 lag term (AR1 processes), and then applying the
discovery and evaluation algorithms in Section 2.2 on the simulated time series with
various extend of stationarity to determine if results obtained from the previous section
can be replicated with simple mean reverting time series. Simulated time series has the
following form:

Xt “ ρXt´1 ` (cid:15)t,

where (cid:15)t „ N p0, 1q. The parameter ρ in this model determines the strength of stationar-
ity of the time series. We simulate time series for diﬀerent values of ρ, each with a length
of 1,000,000; and then apply the discovery and evaluation algorithms in Section 2.2 with
a 60 time unit lag window. Figure 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 displays the estimated ppb|bprevq for
AR1 processes with ρ “ 1, ρ “ 0.95 and ρ “ 0.9 respectively.

Estimated ppb|bprevq for AR1 Process with ρ “ 0.9. The conﬁdence intervals are constructed
using a width of 1 standard deviation on each side.

For simulated AR1 series with ρ “ 1, there is no visually discernible diﬀerence for the
estimated ppb|bprevq between the original series and shuﬄed returns series. This means
that if the time series is a random walk, there is no memory in the time series and
that the probability of bouncing again of a discovered SR level is not dependent on the
number of previous bounces. This also shows that a time series with shuﬄed returns can
be interpreted as a random walk for our purposes. However, if we simulate stationary
AR1 series, such as that of ρ “ 0.95 and ρ “ 0.9, we can see that smaller ρ increases the
values of the estimated ppb|bprevq. This is within our expectation as we would expect
stronger stationarity, in terms of the parameter ρ, to increase the probability of mean
reversion, regardless of the existence of SR levels.

The results displayed here diﬀers from the EURUSD, LLOY and BRENT price series in
that bprev values seem to have a negative correlation with the probability of bouncing.
An explanation for this would be that it is statistically less likely to have higher bounces
on a recent maximum/minimum, if a genuine SR level does not exist. Independence of
previous bounces means that the probability of bouncing can be interpreted as inde-
pendent Bernoulli events with ppbq, and that decreasing the value of ρ simply increases
the value of ppbq; therefore having multiple bounces on the same level in a lag window,
is akin to having a bounce event happening multiple times, which yields a smaller prob-
ability according to the multiplicative rule of probability, assuming ppbq ă 1. We can
therefore conclude that the results we obtain from the ﬁnancial price series cannot be
replicated from simple stationary AR1 processes; and some that other features, which
very well could be SR levels, are in play to create price trend reversals at recent price
maximum/minimum.

6. Conclusion & Future Work

In this paper, the existence of SR levels and the tendency of price trends reversing at
these levels are investigated. Stacking of limit orders and trader psychology are two
possible, though not mutually exclusive, reasons for the existence of SR levels. Though
qualitative knowledge of SR levels has been accumulating for at least 3 decades in
the retail trading circle, no formal quantitative deﬁnition has been established. We
therefore propose a general deﬁnition of SR levels suitable for the evaluation framework
used throughout this paper.

levels to reverse price trends by the probability of price bouncing on SR levels within a
short intraday time frame. Using a heuristic method of discovering SR levels, we gath-
ered empirical evidence that price have a higher probability of bouncing on discovered
SR levels. We also ﬁnd that the number of previous bounces of an SR level positively
correlates with price bouncing on it again. This result is statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent from the same price series with shuﬄed returns, exhibits temporal decay which is
dependent on the particular asset and cannot be replicated simply by simulated AR(1)
processes, stationary or otherwise.

Moving forward, we would like to analyse limit order book and trade data in order to
improve the current SR level discovery methodology in relation to the market micro-
structure. Using the discoveries from this analysis, we can then attempt to model SR
levels with agent based models to simulate behaviour and consequences of market par-
ticipants. Finally we would like to explore methods to incorporate SR levels into algo-
rithmic trading strategies such as optimal liquidation/acquisition in continuous ﬁnance.
