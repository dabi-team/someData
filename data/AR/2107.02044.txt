Almost radial gauge

Andrzej Herdegen

Abstract. An almost radial gauge Aar of the electromagnetic potential
is constructed for which x¨Aarpxq vanishes arbitrarily fast in timelike di-
rections. This potential is in the class introduced by Dirac with the pur-
pose of forming gauge-invariant quantities in quantum electrodynamics.
In the quantum case, the construction of smeared operators AarpKq is
enabled by a natural extension of the free electromagnetic ﬁeld algebra
introduced earlier (represented in a Hilbert space). The space of pos-
sible smearing functions K includes vector ﬁelds with the asymptotic
spacetime behavior typical for scattered currents (the conservation con-
dition in the whole spacetime need not be assumed). This construction
is motivated by a possible application to the infrared problem in QED.

1. Introduction

The long-range nature of interaction entails the so called infrared problems
in electrodynamics, both classical and quantum [17]. Some of the quantum
problems in this area are speciﬁc for this realm, but other reveal themselves
already on the classical level. The identiﬁcation of asymptotic charged ﬁelds
and the scattering theory belong to the latter class.

The present author has long followed the idea that an appropriate choice
of the electromagnetic gauge may relieve the scattering infrared problems.
After preliminary results [11], it was shown recently that indeed the classical
asymptotic problem for scattering of the Dirac ﬁeld in electromagnetic time-
dependent ﬁeld, typical for the complete theory, disappears in certain gauges.
The main constituent feature of this class is suﬃciently fast vanishing of the
product x ¨ Apxq for x tending to timelike inﬁnity (with an arbitrarily ﬁxed
origin x “ 0 in Minkowski space) [15]. The choice of a speciﬁc potential in
this class has a large freedom in this classical context. However, we plan to

extend our analysis to quantum electrodynamics, and in that case a judicious
choice of our gauge is of fundamental importance.

The ﬁrst gauge which probably comes to mind is the radial gauge
x ¨ Argpxq “ 0, going also in literature by the names Fock-Schwinger or rel-
ativistic Poincaré gauge ( [9, 24], see also [16]). In classical electrodynamics
this gauge is well deﬁned and may be obtained by integration of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. In quantum theory the latter property would be
an advantage, as no indeﬁnite metric space would be needed. However, we
shall indicate in the following that the quantum version of this gauge is sin-
gular, which explains the need for a posteriori regularization in attempts to
construct perturbative calculus with the use of this gauge [19].

It is the purpose of the present article to construct an ‘almost radial
gauge,’ which may also be obtained from the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor
alone, and for which x ¨ Aarpxq vanishes fast in timelike directions, but which
at the same time admits quantization. Almost radial gauge turns out to
be in the Dirac family of ‘gauge-invariant gauges’, which in the standard
formulation of QED may be constructed only after initial regularization and
the use of the indeﬁnite Gupta-Bleuler metric (see the discussion of this
problem in [25], p. 191). We choose a diﬀerent approach. For the construction
of the quantum ﬁeld we use a natural extension of the algebra of the free ﬁeld
proposed earlier [12], which enables representation of infrared-singular ﬁelds.
This extension admits the construction of the almost radial gauge, and allows
moreover its well-deﬁned smearing with vector functions typically appearing
in scattering.

As we shall see, the construction of the almost radial gauge involves
integration of the electromagnetic ﬁeld along radial R-axes. This bears some
similarity to the integration of the ﬁeld along spacelike semi-axes, which is
the principle of the construction of string-localized potentials introduced by
Mund, Schroer and Yngvason [21]. We shall discuss similarities and diﬀerences
of the two constructions.

The plan of the article is as follows. In Section 2 we summarize our
notation and mathematical tools to be used in the article. Section 3 contains
a brief summary of the quantization of the standard free ﬁeld algebra, and
its extension mentioned above. The classical radial gauge, and its singularity
in quantum case, are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 contains our main
results: construction and evaluation of properties of the almost radial gauge,
both classical and quantum, along the lines announced above. In Section 6
we compare our construction with the string-localized potentials. Section 7
contains some ﬁnal remarks. Proofs of some technical points are shifted to
Appendix.

2. Preliminaries

We list here our notation, conventions and preliminary formulas. More ex-
tensive summary of these questions may be found in [14].

We consider the ﬂat spacetime with a ﬁxed origin, thus described by
the Minkowski vector space M with the scalar product x ¨ y with signature
p`, ´, ´, ´q. We choose physical units for which ~, c and an arbitrarily chosen
length scale are all equal to 1. Then, in particular, x P M may be treated as
dimensionless. We ﬁx a unit timelike, future-pointing vector t and for a Min-
kowski vector x we write x0 “ x ¨ t and x “ x ´ px ¨ tqt. The 3-dimensional
norm of x is denoted |x|, and we also write |x| “ p|x0|2 ` |x|2q
2 . The tensor
indices, which are often suppressed, are denoted by a, b etc. The Minkowski
volume measure element is denoted dx. Our results do not depend on the
choice of vector t.

where Λ is a Lorentz transformation of the Minkowski space. The derivative
Bf {Bla can only be given a unique meaning if one determines a particular C1-
extension of f to a neighborhood of C

diﬀer by a term l2gplq, with a C1-function gplq in a neighborhood of C

`
the derivatives Bf plq obtained from these two extensions diﬀer

`

in any chosen reference frame, then Baf plq is uniquely deﬁned as an equiv-
alence class with respect to the addition of terms proportional to la. If the
deﬁnition of f plq is the restriction of a function naturally deﬁned in some
neighborhood of C

, then this function may also serve to deﬁne Baf plq.

Another closely related identity is the following. Let V aplq be a C1-vector
, such that l ¨ V plq “ 0. Suppose V plq is extended to a neigh-
function on C

each Minkowski frame one has

lity)-independent. Moreover, if in addition V plq is homogeneous of degree ´1,
then

B ¨ V plq d2l “ 0 .

If f plq is a scalar C1-function, homogeneous of degree 0, then the last identity
and the earlier remarks on Baf plq imply the ‘integration by parts’ identity

2.4. Free electromagnetic ﬁeld
A Lorenz potential A of a free electromagnetic ﬁeld F has the representa-
tion (4), where 9V ps, lq is a vector function satisfying the condition

l ¨ 9V ps, lq “ 0 .

(10)

We assume that the condition (5) with N ě 1 is satisﬁed, so ∆V plq exists,
and satisﬁes l ¨ ∆V plq “ 0. Moreover, we demand in addition that

homogeneous of degree 0 function Φplq, such that

Fields with ∆V plq ‰ 0 are usually termed as infrared singular; their spacelike
tail falls oﬀ as that of the Coulomb ﬁeld of the electric charge.
For future use we note the following representation

follows immediately from the relation

by the use of identity (1).

Finally, it is important for what comes to relate representation (4) to
the construction of the radiation potential of a conserved vector current Jpxq,

B ¨ Jpxq “ 0 .

Almost radial gauge

Let Jpxq be such current, for which 9V ps, lq, with

satisﬁes conditions (5). Then the radiation potential of this current has two

Quantization of the local free electromagnetic ﬁeld may be described in terms
of the algebra of electromagnetic potential elements ApJq satisfying the rela-
tions

ż

J1pxqDpx ´ yqJ2pyq dx dy “ itJ1, J2u ,

(19)

where Ji are smooth, compactly supported conserved test currents (as dis-
cussed in [12] and [13]). After exponentiation to the Weyl form, this deﬁnes
a net of C˚-algebras satisfying Einstein causality in the form of commu-
tation for spacelike separated supports of Ji.3 This formulation is close to
the discussion given in [23]. In more standard formulation one treats the
free electromagnetic ﬁeld as an operator-valued distribution on the space
of antisymmetric, smooth, compactly supported functions ϕabpxq. Then the
elements

F pϕq “ ApJq , where J a “ 2Bbϕab ,
generate the standard net of electromagnetic ﬁeld, where now F pϕq is con-
sidered as an element of the local algebra of any open set containing supp ϕ.
However, as each conserved, compactly supported current J a has a represen-
tation (20) with a compactly supported4 ϕab, the nets have the same ele-
ments, with some diﬀerences in the assignment to spacetime sets. Moreover,
two important properties bind the two nets:

(20)

3More recently, description in terms of ‘intrinsic potential’ ApJq has been used for an axio-
matic construction of a general local electromagnetic algebra in [6]. In that case, according
to this analysis, the commutators for spacelike separated, but topologically nontrivial re-
gions need not vanish, but are in the center of the algebra.
4This more speciﬁc Poincaré lemma for compact supports follows from its standard form
and the properties of cohomology of spheres, see e.g. [18], Lemma 17.27. Also, the proof in
that reference easily implies that for supp J contained in an open, star-shaped set, there
exists ϕ with support contained in the same set. See also [6].

8

(i) the nets are local with respect to each other, i.e.,

rF pϕq, ApJqs “ 0

for spacelike separated supports of ϕ and J;

(ii) for each open star-shaped set the two local algebras assigned to this set

are equal.

The ﬁrst property is obvious from (19) and (20), and for the second see
footnote 4.

The symplectic form on the rhs of (19) may be expressed in terms of
functions V ps, lq deﬁned by (16). Substituting in this form representation (9),
one obtains5

The quantization condition (19) takes now the form

This condition is now extended to the space of all smooth, compactly sup-
ported functions V ps, lq, satisfying orthogonality6

l ¨ V ps, lq “ 0 ,

(24)

which for V ps, lq obtained from J reﬂects the fact that the current is charge-
less. The form (21) is nondegenerate on the space of equivalence classes of
such functions with respect to gauge transformations (13). This may be also
interpreted as follows: the symplectic structure is deﬁned and nondegenerate
on the space of infrared regular classical ﬁelds (12). This leads to the unique
Weyl algebra satisfying the corresponding exponentiated condition on this
space (see [4], Section 5.2.2.2). Consider the scalar product on the space of
equivalence classes

and the Hilbert space H obtained by completion. The standard construction
leads to the representation of the algebra on the Fock space based on H.
When restricted to the exponentiated elements F pϕq, this is the standard
irreducible vacuum representation of the local net.

In interacting theory one needs to form elements ApKq, where the vector
function K need not be conserved, and secondly, need not be compactly

5By a slight abuse of notation, we use here the same symbol as in (19).
6This formulation of the quantization is in the spirit of ‘asymptotic quantization’ discussed
by Bramson [3] and later by Ashtekar [1]).

supported. The ﬁrst problem (non-conservation of K) is dealt by choosing
A in some special gauge, and in local formulation of QED this leads to the
Gupta-Bleuler indeﬁnite metric. The second problem (non-compactness) is
avoided in usual formulations by the introduction of a switching function
gpxq and the subsequent performance of the ‘adiabatic limit’ g Ñ 1. This
programme of the solution of infrared problems is far from complete.7 Here
we want to propose a construction avoiding both problems, with the use of
a natural extension of the above algebra to the free infrared singular ﬁelds,
put forward in [12]. We brieﬂy sketch the construction of this extension.

The symplectic structure (21) has a natural extension to a wider space.
It is easy to see that the form remains well deﬁned (absolutely integrable) and
gauge invariant for general functions Vi subject to conditions (5) with N “ 8,
(11) and (24). However, for this structure to be again consistently formulated
on the space of all classical ﬁelds (12) (now also those infrared-singular when
∆Viplq ‰ 0), we have to make the choice of V ps, lq for given 9V ps, lq unique. We
make this choice guided by the following physical motivation (as discussed in
[13]). Free ﬁelds appear in realistic physical theories as incoming or outgoing
ﬁelds in scattering setting. We want to admit the possibility of testing these
ﬁelds with currents inﬁnitely extended in timelike directions.8 Formula (16)
tells us that for V p`8, lq (V p´8, lq) to be diﬀerent from zero, the test current
3 type) decay in the future
J must have a suﬃciently slow (in fact, of |x|´
(past), respectively. Therefore, it seems reasonable to adopt the rule that

V p`8, lq “ 0
V p´8, lq “ 0

for ‘in’ case ,

for ‘out’ case ,

(26)

consistently with the spacetime regions where the ﬁelds are tested: ‘in’ in
the past, and ‘out’ in the future; the same rule is adopted for the quantum
variables V qps, lq. Let us mention that all such extended currents are charge-
free (see (18)), and that the symplectic form tV1, V2u for such currents may
be represented in the form

tJ1, J2u “ 1

ArJ1s ¨ J2 ´ ArJ2s ¨ J1

(27)

2 żM `

pxq dx ,
˘

where ArJispxq are radiation ﬁelds (17). For compactly supported Ji this
agrees with the deﬁnition in (19); however, the latter is not absolutely inte-
grable in general.

Relations (23), considered on the space of functions V ps, lq satisfying (5)
with N “ 8, (11), (24) and (26), deﬁne (after exponentiation) a C˚-algebra,
an extension of the standard local algebra. Algebras for ‘in’ and ‘out’ cases are
canonically isomorphic. For Ji with supports spacelike separated the usual
commutation rule is fulﬁlled. Also, the form (27) shows that the timelike
commutativity characteristic for massless ﬁelds extends as well: if supp J1 is
timelike separated from supp J2, then the two ﬁelds commute, irrespective of
the size of the supports.

7But see a recent contribution to this programme [8].
8Extensive discussion of such test currents may be found in [13]; see also what follows.

The Poincaré group transformations pz, Λq are represented by the auto-

morphisms αz,Λ acting on the algebra by

Translationally covariant, positive energy, irreducible representations of
the extended algebra have been constructed in [12] and [13]. Also, there exist
among them those for which rotations are implemented, although not Lorentz
boosts. In these representations there are vector states with arbitrarily small
energy content, but no vacuum vector state exists.

The integral in the Fourier-transformed version of the symplectic form

(21) is now in the principal value sense. Note also that
Therefore, elements tV1, V qu with ∆V1plq ‰ 0, describing infrared-singular
ﬁelds, have no representation in the vacuum representation of the local al-
gebra, which is based on the scalar product (25). We shall see in Section 5
below, that our larger arena enables the construction of elements AarpKq
for appropriately extended functions K and almost radial gauge Aar to be
deﬁned there.

The rhs has the correct homogeneity and is independent of the choice of the
vector t. The metric tensor on the rhs could suggest indeﬁnite metric, but
this is not the case: this relation is smeared with (equivalence classes with
respect to (13) of) functions Vips, lq orthogonal to l. In local formulation of
interacting theory one needs to smear Apxq with non-conserved test vector
ﬁelds, and then the usual Gupta-Bleuler formulation is needed.

Finally, let us note for future use that if both Vips, lq satisfy one and

the same of the conditions (26), then

4. Radial gauge

As announced in Introduction, we are now looking for a suitable quantum
gauge, in which x ¨ Apxq vanishes (suﬃciently fast) in timelike directions. We
start by testing the radial gauge for that purpose, for a classical ﬁeld ﬁrst.

addition to Arg

the origin, if it is not constant.

The lhs of (33) shows immediately that for F —a free Maxwell ﬁeld, the
radial gauge is a Lorenz gauge. Let Apxq be a Lorenz gauge as speciﬁed in

For a classical ﬁeld, with suﬃciently regular V ps, lq, the radial gauge
ş
function (36) is regular and the representation (35) is well deﬁned (e.g.,
for a smooth V ps, lq both V rgps, lq and Argpxq are smooth), although with

12

marked diﬀerences as compared to A. In contrast to 9V ps, lq, which satis-
1 for large |s|. This has two consequences:
ﬁes (5),
ﬁrst, there is no null asymptotics of the form (6) for Argpxq; and second, the
estimate (8) is replaced by a slower decay

9V rgps, lq decays only as s´

which is easily obtained with the use of estimate (82).

However, for the quantum version it follows immediately from the jux-
taposition of formulas (36) and (30) that V rgps, lq, and consequently also
Argpxq, are not properly deﬁned, due to the appearance of a distributional
quantity at a point: B ¨ V p0, lq. This, in our view, is the fundamental reason
for the reported diﬃculties and a need for a posteriori regularization in at-
tempts to establish Feynman rules in the radial gauge (see [19] and references
therein).

5. Almost radial gauge

The source of trouble in the radial gauge is the term B ¨ V p0, lq in the function
9V rgps, lq. Our plan is to modify the deﬁnition (33) so as to eliminate this
term. This will only be possible with some smearing of the central, reference
point. The result of this programme is the construction of an almost radial
gauge potential Aar

b pxq in formulas (49), (50), (51) and (72) below.

The starting point for the construction is the following variant of the

identity (32)

5.1. Potential of fast decay
We start discussion with the case of Abpxq a C1-function of fast decay, to-
gether with its derivative. For such function one could think of integrating
identity (37) with respect to ξ on r0, 8q, which would correspond to the λ-
integration of (32) on r1, 8q. However, for F –a free electromagnetic ﬁeld,
which will be our object of study later, this would not be convergent for
ax. In that case, one has to exploit the oddness (in the spacetime)
spacelike
of its spacelike tail (and evenness of the tail of A, see (14)) and deﬁne integrals

Ĺ

Almost radial gauge

as appropriate limits. Anticipating this, we multiply (37) by p´ 1

Formulas (42), (44) and (45) together show that our almost radial gauge is in
the class of generalized ‘gauge-invariant gauges’ ﬁrst postulated by Dirac [7]
in an attempt to obtain ‘physical,’ out of local potentials (see also [25]).
The generalization consists in nontrivial dependence of rapx, x ´ yq on the

14

Andrzej Herdegen

ﬁrst argument. Potential Aarpxq is a continuous function, decaying as |x|´
for large |x|, thus

1

|Aarpxq| ď

const
1 ` |x|

.

To estimate the radial component of Aar assume for simplicity that the sup-
axaxbFab “
port of ρpaq is contained in a small ball |a| ď δ, and note that
axaabFab . Then the contraction of (43) with x gives

Ĺ

Ĺ

|x ¨ Aarpxq| ď δ

const
1 ` |x|

.

In the present case of a fast decaying function A, the ‘almost radial’ property
has only a global aspect, appearance of δ on the rhs. It is the case of free
ﬁeld discussed below, where this term has a fuller justiﬁcation.

We note that a strict Dirac gauge with rp0, x ´ yq replacing rpx, x ´ yq

in (45) is also possible, but it does not have the almost radial property.

5.2. Free classical ﬁeld
We now assume that Fabpxq is a free classical ﬁeld obtained from the poten-
tial (4), where 9V ps, lq satisﬁes all restrictions formulated there. The deﬁni-
tion (45) may not be directly applied in this case, but we shall ﬁnd that an
extension of this deﬁnition may be obtained as a limit of a regularized ex-
pression. We admit infrared singular ﬁelds, thus ∆V plq may be diﬀerent from
zero. For the sake of the construction of almost radial gauge at the classical
level, it will prove convenient to use the convention ¯V ps, lq (7). The choice
(26) will be restored at the stage of quantization.

The following auxiliary functions will be needed:

(we assume σps, lq is deﬁned by the above formula also in a neighborhood
of the light cone, so Bσps, lq is also unique in this case). Properties of these
functions are discussed in Appendix C. Let χpxq be a Schwartz function, such
that

the second form (51) obtained with the use of identity (84). Our almost
radial gauge is a functional of the smearing function ρ (40), which serves
to deﬁne functions ζ and η (46). Note that putting formally ρpaq “ δpaq
1, ηps, lq “ 0 and (51)
(which, precisely, is not allowed), one has ζps, lq “ s´
reproduces formula (36) with the term pB ¨ V qp0, lq omitted (which, again,
would result in a singularity).

The almost radial gauge is again a Lorenz gauge satisfying the wave

equation. It is also gauge invariant with respect to gauge transformations

which correspond to the replacement ¯Vbps, lq Ñ ¯Vbps, lq ` lb ¯αps, lq. This re-
placement leaves 9V ar
b ps, lq unchanged. To show this we put l ¯αps, lq in place of
¯V ps, lq in (51). Recall that to calculate B ¨ rl ¯αps, lqs one has to extend l ¯αps, lq
to the neighborhood of the light cone respecting orthogonality to l, e.g., by

la ¯αps, lq Ñ rla ¯αps, lqsext “ rla ´ pl0q´

as ¯αps, lq ,

and then on the light cone B ¨ rl ¯αps, lqsext “ pl ¨ B ` 2q¯αps, lq. In this way the
change in (51) becomes

where we used identity (85) and the homogeneity of degree ´2 of ¯αps, lq.

Similarly as in the radial gauge case,

9V arps, lq decays only as 1{s for

the last equality by the homogeneity of l ¨ W ps, lq. Equality (59) is immediate
from the second form of 9VK in (57).

We note that the function ¯VKps, lq satisﬁes all demands (5) with N “ 8,
(11) and (24) on a test function in the extended symplectic form (21), but in
general—for non-conserved K—is outside the original test functions space.

5.4. More general smearing
Now we want to extend the smearing AarpKq to C1-vector functions Kpxq,
with the spacetime asymptotic behavior characteristic for currents of scat-
tered free particles or ﬁelds. We shall show that with appropriately speciﬁc
conditions on K, the function W ps, lq (55) is of class C1 and satisﬁes the
bounds

Therefore, the integrals in (56), with the deﬁnitions (57), are absolutely con-
vergent for this extension. Moreover, ¯VKps, lq thus formed satisﬁes conditions
(5) with N “ 0, (11) and (24). In addition, let gpxq be a Schwartz function,
with gp0q “ 1 and denote Kδpxq “ gpδxqKpxq. Then we shall ﬁnd that irre-
spective of the shape of g the following extension of the identity (56) holds

To specify the class for which the above results hold, it is convenient to
characterize such class by splitting the function K into three C1-contribu-
tions: K “ K1 ` K2 ` K3, with the following properties:

K1pxq “ x κpxq ,

|BK3pxq| ď

(64)

Condition (62) characterizes the dominant asymptotic behavior of particles,
and the non-oscillatory part of asymptotic behavior of ﬁelds. The oscillatory
contribution in the case of ﬁelds is represented by K2, bounded by (63), and
we shall characterize it more precisely below. The rest is represented by K3,
conditions (64) characterizing the next to leading behaviour inside the light
cone, and decay of K outside.9

We prove our claims separately for each contribution Ki, except for

property (11), which will be discussed at the end.

We ﬁrst note that all Wips, lq, deﬁned by (55) with K replaced by Ki,

|W3ps, lq| , |LabW3ps, lq| ď

are absolutely convergent and bounded. Moreover, in case i “ 3 one has
const
p1 ` |s|qε ,
all these statements are proved as in Lemma 20 and Theorem 21 in ref. [15].
Therefore, bounds (60) are satisﬁed for W3. Next, we observe that both

const
p1 ` |s|q1

| 9W3ps, lq| ď

ε ;

`

Aarpxq ¨ K3pxq

and Aarpxq ¨ K1pxq “ x ¨ Aarpxq κpxq

are absolutely integrable (see (52) and (54)), so the δ-regularization in (61)
is not needed for these contributions. Thus, in case i “ 3 we obtain

9V arpx ¨ l, lq d2l K3pxq dx

9V arps, lq ¨ W3ps, lq ds d2l ,

so the thesis for this contribution follows.

9Suppose, for deﬁniteness, that K asymptotically behaves as the current of a free classical
Dirac ﬁeld. Then by standard stationary phase methods (e.g. [22]) the rest, beside the
leading order in K, represented by K3, is rather safely estimated by (64). The leading
order in the asymptotic ﬁeld, by this method, has the form of a homogeneous function
of degree ´3{2, with the support inside the light cone, multiplied by an oscillating term.
In the hermitian form of the current, the oscillations cancel for terms with same energy
sign, and add up for terms with opposite energy sign. Proportionality of the homogeneous
term to x is related to the fact, that the current asymptotically is interpreted as particles
escaping in timelike directions (see e.g. [11]). Matrix elements of the current will have
similar structure in the quantum case.

Moreover, we note that the interior of the light cone (past and future) may
be parametrized by x “ λv, λ P R and v on the future hyperboloid v2 “ 1,
v0 ě 0, and then dx “ |λ|3dλ dµpvq, where dµpvq “ d3v{v0. It follows then

as in case W3:

5.5. Quantum ﬁeld
We have shown in the classical case that AarpKq “ t ¯VK, ¯V u. However, recall
the identity (31), which holds in each of the cases (26), that is both for ‘in’
and for ‘out’ algebra. Thus, on the algebraic level, in each of these two cases
we propose to deﬁne the quantum almost radial gauge of the potential
by10

AarpKq “ tVK , V qu ,

(72)

whenever VKps, lq deﬁned by (57) and (26) falls in our extended symplectic
space deﬁned after (27). This condition demands stronger regularity prop-
erties of K than those assumed in Section 5.4, leading to classical version
of (72). One can show that a class of such functions may be obtained by a
modiﬁcation of the currents J considered in [13], where the modiﬁcation con-
sists in demanding the continuity equation to be satisﬁed only asymptotically
in time (in the form of an appropriately regular analogue of (62)). On the
other hand, in concrete representations the scope of admitted test functions
is wider, and the deﬁnition of the almost radial gauge may be also appropri-
ately extended at the level of representation. We do not go into details here
and leave the question to be decided in applications.

The almost radial gauge is a Lorenz gauge. For Kpxq “ BF pxq one ﬁnds

that VKps, lq “ W ps, lq9 l, which is in the zero equivalence class. Thus

AarpBF q “ 0 .

Moreover, for Kpxq “ lGpxq we have W ps, lq “ 0, so

AarplGq “ 0 .

For test functions Kpxq in the class of conserved currents admitted
in ApKq in one of the cases ‘in’ or ‘out’ one has l ¨ W ps, lq “ 0, so that
9VKps, lq “ 9W ps, lq and VK ps, lq “ W ps, lq. Therefore, in this case

AarpKq “ ApKq ,

which reproduces the extended free algebra.

Finally, let us note the following important corollary. If K is a conserved,
non-radiating current, such as the current of a free, charged classical particle,
or of the free (classical or quantum) Dirac ﬁeld, then W ps, lq “ W plq is
constant in s and l ¨ W plq “ Q, the charge of the current (see ref. [11],
discussion starting with Eq. (2.70)). Therefore, for such currents VK “ 0 and

AarpKq “ 0 .

10Our extended ﬁeld algebra of Section 3 is deﬁned directly in terms of test functions
V ps, lq, and in that sense the deﬁnition (72) is fully compatible with its classical proto-
type. We do not consider here the question of convergence of the quantum version of the
limit (61).

5.6. Transformation and commutation properties

We recall that almost radial gauge is a functional of the function ρ serving
to smear the point a from which the radial line to x is drawn. Let us make
this dependence explicit by writing AarpK; ρq. With Poincaré transformations
of the extended algebra deﬁned in (28), these elements have the covariance
property given by

αz,Λ

AarpK; ρq
‰
“

“ Aar

Tz,ΛK; Tz,Λρ
`

˘

.

(73)

In this sense, ApK; ρq may be regarded algebraically covariant, with unitarily
implementable translations. For the proof of the covariance relation one notes
that

W rTz,ΛKsps, lq “ ΛW rKsps ´ z ¨ l, Λ´
1lq ,

ζrTz,Λρsps, lq “ ζrρsps ´ z ¨ l, Λ´

1lq ,

ηrTz,Λρsps, lq “ Ληrρsps ´ z ¨ l, Λ´

1lq ` zζrρsps ´ z ¨ l, Λ´

1lq .

Setting these relations into the formula (57) for VK , and then using the result
in (29), one arrives at the thesis.

Elements AarpK; ρq do not have compact localization even if the sup-
port of K is compact. However, the following remnant timelike locality with
respect to A holds. Let the support of an admissible test vector function K
and the support of a conserved test current J be timelike separated, and let
V ps, lq for current J (16) have ∆V plq “ 0 (in particular, this is always true
for compactly supported J). Then

rAarpK; ρq, ApJqs “ 0 ,

(74)

irrespective of the choice of ρ. To show this, we ﬁrst note that it is suﬃcient
to show this when the two supports are placed inside the future and the
past parts of the same light cone, with any vertex point b. Next, we apply
to the commutator translation automorphism α
b,1. The commutator, with-
out changing its value (being proportional to identity), takes now the form
rAarpK 1; ρ1q, ApJ 1qs, where K 1 and J 1 are similarly separated as K and J, but
with the vertex of the light cone in the origin. In consequence, the functions
W 1ps, lq for K 1 (55), and V 1ps, lq for J 1 (16), are supported in s P p0, `8q or
s P p´8, 0q, each in a diﬀerent of the two sets. Now, it follows from (57) that
the support of 9VK 1 ps, lq is not larger than the support of W 1ps, lq, so the same
conclusion is valid for the pair 9VK 1ps, lq and V 1ps, lq. But from ∆V 1plq “ 0,
together with (26), it follows that

´

6. Almost radial gauge and string-localized ﬁelds:

comparative remarks

Deﬁnition of the almost radial gauge was motivated by integration, on the
classical level, of the electromagnetic potential along straight axes (43). An-
other construction based on integration along inﬁnitely extended straight
lines is the formalism of string-localized ﬁelds (potentials) developed by Mund,
Schroer and Yngvason [21] (based on earlier works, as explained in this refer-
ence) and worked out later in many articles.11 The two constructions result
from quite diﬀerent motivations and aims; nevertheless, it seems interesting
to make some comparison. For that purpose we brieﬂy recall and formulate in
our language the latter in the case of electrodynamics.12 All electromagnetic
ﬁelds are assumed to satisfy the homogeneous Maxwell equations.

The string-localized potentials in electrodynamics are distributions in

position vectors x and spacelike unit vectors e deﬁned by13

Asl

b px, eq “

żR`

Fbapx ` λeqea dλ .

To obtain a vector potential as an x-distribution, one needs a scalar test
function hpeq on the hyperboloid e2 “ ´1, such that

hpeq dνpeq “ 1 ,

ż

(75)

where the integration is over the hyperboloid with the Lorentz invariant mea-
sure dνpeq. Then

Asl

b px; hq “

(76)

is an h-dependent potential, commuting with the ﬁeld Fabpyq at points y in
spacelike position to the set of points x`λe, λ P R
, e P supp h. In particular,
if supp h is contained in some double-cone spacelike separated from 0, then
Aslpx; hq is localized in a spacelike cone.

`

This potential is in the Lorenz class, and using the representation (12)

we show in Appendix F that on the classical level

11See e.g. a recent discussion of an application to QED problems [20].
12Our perspective is diﬀerent from the discussion of string-localized ﬁelds in [21], which
starts from the unitary representations of the Poincaré group and engages the notion of
modular localization [2]. Here we want to avoid the a priori assumption on the action of
a representation of the Lorentz group.
13There exists a version of this construction with lightlike e, see [10].

24

Andrzej Herdegen

where the integrals in (78) and in nplq are in the principal value sense, and
not to burden notation we do not indicate the dependence on h explicitly.
For a vector Schwartz test function Kpxq we then ﬁnd in analogy to (56)
AslpK; hq “ tV sl

(79)

K , V u ,

where in place of (57), and keeping notation (55), we have

V sl
K ps, lq “ W ps, lq ´ nplq l ¨ W ps, lq ` zplq

ż
In contrast to W ps, lq, which is of fast decrease, V sl
K ps, lq vanishes in general
1, see the last term in (80). Therefore, the (exponentiated) formula
only as s´
(79) cannot give, upon quantization, an element in the local algebra, even if
K is local. However, we have

which is suﬃcient for elements (79) to be represented in the standard vacuum
representation of the ﬁeld F , in contrast to the almost radial gauge, which
needs the extended algebra including infrared singular ﬁelds.

The formulation of a gauge theory in terms of string-localized poten-
tials puts stress on their Poincaré covariance. In vacuum representation the
action of the Poincaré automorphisms αz,Λ of the observable algebra given
by (28) is implemented by a unitary representation U pz, Λq. Then, in this
representation, one also has
AslpK; hq

˘
At the algebraic level our transformation law (73) is analogous to (81). How-
ever, as mentioned before, in our case not all Lorentz transformations are
implemented.

(81)

Let us now return again to the question of localization and commutation.
String-localized ﬁelds located on spacelike separated strings commute (which
remains true for slightly smeared strings); this is an important property in
the formalism of these ﬁelds. Whether almost radial gauge may be localized
in spacelike extended regions in some special cases and special points x is
a subtle question, which we do not want to consider here; anyway, this cannot
be a generic property of this gauge. On the other hand, it has a timelike
commutation property (74). We have seen that this property depended on
the fact that the support of 9VK ps, lq was not greater than that of W ps, lq. The
latter property does not hold for V sl
K ps, lq because of the last term in (80).
Therefore, for string-localized ﬁelds timelike commutativity does not hold, in
general.

It is interesting to note that the function zplq vanishes for even func-
tions h, hp´eq “ hpeq, which are admitted by the condition (75). For such
functions the last term in (80) is absent and the elements AslpK; hq acquire
the timelike locality as formulated above for AarpK; ρq. As here the algebra is
the standard local electromagnetic algebra of the free ﬁeld, this leads in fact
to the following implication in the vacuum representation. If the support of

Almost radial gauge

25

2 ą x0

the smearing function K is contained in an open double-cone with vertices
x1 and x2, x0
1, then AslpKq belongs to the intersection of the von Neu-
mann algebras connected with the following two regions: the interior of the
future light cone with the vertex in x1, and the interior of the past light cone
with the vertex in x2. This follows from the timelike duality for the vacuum
representation of massless ﬁelds, see [5]. Condition of evenness of h may be
equivalently formulated as string integration along whole real axes, instead
of semi-axes; the spacelike localization and commutation properties are then
retained (with obvious modiﬁcations).14

One could also observe that the last term in (80) seems to worsen the
infrared/adiabatic limit behavior: for K becoming inﬁnitely extended so that
W ps, lq does not vanish in inﬁnity, this term becomes meaningless. On the
other hand, if the term is absent, then the algebra of elements (79) may be
also built in the extended algebra of electromagnetic ﬁeld described earlier.

7. Outlook

The results of the analysis in [11, 15] suggest that, for the classical Maxwell-
Dirac system in an appropriate radial-like gauge, the asymptotic Dirac and
radiation ﬁelds may be largely separated, with the Dirac ﬁeld carrying its
own Coulomb ﬁeld. Motivated by this, we proposed in [12, 13] an asymptotic
algebra incorporating these ideas on the quantum level. The free electromag-
netic part of this algebra is the extended algebra described in Section 3. In
order to turn on full interaction in this setting, one needs an appropriate
potential. The present construction is a further step in our program.

One should stress that our almost radial gauge could not be constructed
within the limits of the standard local theory: see remarks at the end of Sec-
tion 5.3 and the deﬁnition of the quantum almost radial gauge in Section 5.5.
Our construction engages nonlocal quantum variables of the extended alge-
bra, which do not appear in the local theory (either in its C˚-structure, or
in its irreducible representations). Therefore, these nonlocal aspects are not
a consequence, but a prerequisite of the present construction. The long-range
structure of the representations of our asymptotic algebra, quite diﬀerent
from the structure in local quantum electrodynamics, was partly considered
in [13, 14]. Further investigation of these questions, not being directly re-
lated to the construction of the almost radial gauge, is left for a discussion
elsewhere.

14The relation with the notion of modular localization, as used in the string-localized
formalism of [21], is then lost, or at least becomes indirect.

Let K2pxq be of the form (cf. [11])

K2pxq “ eiµ?x2

where kpxq is a C2-vector function, supported inside the light cone and van-

F. String-localized potential

We prove here formula (77) with (78). First, we note the following simple
limiting formula. Let f and g be C0-functions on R, C1 in a neighborhood
of 0, such that f is bounded, and gpuq{u is absolutely integrable on |u| ě 1.
Then

all integrals in the principal value sense. The ﬁrst equality is by the change
of integration variable τ “ εu, εΛ “ 1. The second formula is obviously true
for integration restricted to |u| ě 1. For |u| ď 1 the principal value integral
in the middle may be written as

The ﬁrst term gives the value on the rhs of (93), and the second term vanishes
in the limit.

Next, we note that formula (76) may be written as

Asl

where for simplicity let hpeq be compactly supported. For e in a compact
subset of the hyperboloid one has |BbAapx`λeq| ď const{p1`λq2 (the constant
depending on x and the support in e, use e.g. Theorem 18 in [15]), so the
integrand of the iterated integral above is absolutely integrable, and we can
change the order of integration. Let us denote

This may be separated into the diﬀerence of two integrals, with 1{τ treated
in the principal value sense. Taking the limit Λ Ñ 8 with the use of formula
(93), setting (94) and integrating with respect to τ , we obtain
