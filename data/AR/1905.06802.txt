Abstract—  The  effect  of  decreasing  Drain-Induced  Barrier 
Lowering (DIBL) is one of the non-desirable short-channel effects 
in the MOSFETs family, which causes the threshold voltage of the 
transistor to be reduced by increasing the voltage of the drain. This 
effect makes it impossible for circuit designers to consider VT as a 
constant  value,  and  hence,  it  is  necessary  to  calculate  VT  as  a 
function of the drain voltage. Therefore, to consider the effect of 
DIBL  in the  design  of  integrated circuits,  a  large  computational 
burden is imposed on the system, which slows down the simulation 
process  in  circuit-level  simulators,  particularly  when  a  large 
number  of  transistors  are  to  be  simulated.  Accordingly,  in  this 
input  single  output  (MISO)  Nonlinear 
paper,  a  multiple

the  Gram-Schmidt 
orthogonalization  approach  is  proposed,  that  calculates  the 
threshold  voltage  of  the  new  generation  of  MOSFETs,  i.e., 
Junctionless Double-Gate MOSFETs (JL-DG-MOSFETs), with a 
high  precision  and  a  significant  speed-up  in  the  computational 
procedure of the model. It is shown that, on average, the proposed 
numerical  method  is  313  times  faster  than  the  state-of-the-art 
analytical model. The calculated percentage of normalized mean 
square  error  between  the  proposed  model  and  analytical  one  is 
0.435% on average, showing that the proposed approach can be a 
fast and accurate candidate for replacing the analytical modeling.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

D 

rain-Induced  Barrier  Lowering  (DIBL)  is  one  of  the 
short channel effects in MOSFETs, which causes the 
threshold  voltage  of  the  transistor  to  be  reduced  by 
increasing  the  drain  voltage  of  the  transistor.  Hence,  the 
threshold  voltage  cannot  be  considered  as  a  constant  value. 
Researchers  have  proposed  double-gate  MOSFETs  (DG-
MOSFETs) to reduce this effect, as well as to reduce other short 
channel  effects.  Other  advantages  of  DG-MOSFETs 
include  higher  transconductance  and  better  control  of  charge 
carriers  in  the  channel  [1,  2].  Recently,  a  new  type  of  DG-
MOSFETs  have  been  introduced  that do  not have  a  junction, 
and they are referred to as Junctionless DG-MOSFETs (JL-DG-
MOSFET) [3-5]. JL-DG-MOSFETs have the same structure of 
double  gate  MOSFETs,  but  the  transistor's  body  is  doped 
through a channel between source and drain, as shown in Fig. 
1.  This  doped  structure  has  special  advantages  from  the

In a recent work, the effect of non-uniform doping on the 
characteristics  of  symmetric  JL-DG-MOSFETs  has  been 
investigated by employing an empirical modeling approach [8]. 
Various  works  have  focused  on  the  modeling  of  JL-DG-
transistors  based  on  analytical  formulation.  Authors  in    [9] 
investigate the characteristics of an inverter made by  JL-DG-
transistors using a mixed-mode simulation. Moreover, in [10], 
the effect of temperature on the DC and AC performances of 
JL-DG-transistors  is  investigated.  In  [11],  a  charge-based 
compact  model  for  JL-DG-transistors 
to 
investigate  the  DC  and  the  quasi-static  characteristics  of  the 
transistor  technology.  Researchers  in  [12]  studies  electron 
transport  in  Si  JL-DG-transistors  using  multisubband  Monte 
Carlo method, which shows that these transistors can decrease 
the mobility reduction due to surface roughness scattering and 
enhance capability of the current driving. 

is  developed 

Moreover,  other  features  of  short  channel  symmetric  and 

 
 
  
 
to  be  used 

asymmetric  JL-DG-transistors 
in  different 
applications are exploited in [13-18]. For example, to find the 
junctionless 
I-V  specifications  of  cylindrical  nanowire 
MOSFETs,  an  analytical  quantum-mechanical  model 
is 
developed in [13] using the Landauer formalism. The work in 
[13] considers the relevant quantum effects resulting from the 
cylindrical carried confinement, and it handles equations for the 
device features.  In [17], using an analytical model approach, 
authors propose the idea of the Gaussian-like doping inside the 
channel  of  JL-DG-transistors.  This  work  employs 
the 
approximation  by  replacing 
the  nonanalytical  Gaussian 
function  with  the  Gaussian-like  function  for  traditional  DG-
MOSFET. 

In  spite  of  overall  better  performance,  JL-DG-transistors 
still  have  the  disadvantage  of  the  Hot  Carrier  Effect  (HCE). 
Various analytical models have been developed to calculate the 
threshold voltage, which partly considers the problem of the hot 
carrier's effect [19, 20].  For example, the aim of authors in [6] 
is  to  present  an  analytical  model  for  calculating  threshold 
voltages  of  a  JL-DG-MOSFET  [6].  To  explore  the  effect  of 
localized  interface  charges  on  depletion  width  in  these 
MOSFETs, the following 2-D Poisson’s equation is used: 

           (1)

physical  and  mathematical  efforts,  a  well-defined  equation  is 
obtained for the threshold voltage (

analytical models with a desirable accuracy and a much higher 
speed. This method can significantly increase the efficiency and 
speed of the simulation of the circuits. The proposed Multiple 
Input Single Output (MISO) Nonlinear Autoregressive (N-AR) 
model is based on parameters of the analytical model of [6]. In 
the  proposed  model,  the  Gram-Schmidt  orthogonalization 
method has been used to make a large and significant speed-up 
in 
the  computational  procedure  of  model.  It  will  be 
demonstrated  that  the  proposed  model  approximates  the 
analytical model in [6] at a much shorter time with the desired 
accuracy.  

The rest of paper is organized as follows. The Proposed   N-
AR model is described in Section II.  In  Section 
the 
method of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is presented. The

II.  THE PROPOSED N-AR MODEL 

In this paper, the proposed model is a truncated version of 
the  Nonlinear  Auto-Regressive  with  eXogenous 
inputs 
(NARX) model. This model is truncated since it does not have 
exogenous  inputs,  and  hence,  here,  it  is  named  Nonlinear 
Autoregressive (N-AR) model. A wide range of the nonlinear 
dynamic  system  can  be  described  with  the  input  u  and  the 
output y in the NARX structure using the following equation

models, including [6], is that the DIBL effect is still present in 
them, and therefore, the threshold voltage must be calculated as 
a  function  of  the  drain  voltage,  frequently  at  each  time.  This 
issue results in increasing the computational time overhead and 
reducing the design efficiency, especially in integrated circuits 
with a large number of transistors. Therefore, in this paper, a 
model  is  proposed  that  approximates  the  performance  of  the

nonlinear  function  such  as 
  to  determine  the  relationship 
between the inputs, their lags and the output. In this paper, we 
want to model the static behavior of threshold voltage of a JL-
DG-MOSFET, and hence, we don't need to capture the memory 
of the system, and we can remove all of the lag terms from the 
regressor  vector, 
.  Generally,  a  NARX  structure  can 
capture the memory of the system in the dynamic models, but 
also it is summarizable to a static model by removing the lag 
terms  in  its  regressor  vector.  Here  for  JL-DG-MOSFET  let's 
assume N-AR model as a MISO system that has m inputs and 
, 
one  output,  where  the  system’s  inputs  are 

  to 

and the output is 

. Accordingly: 

To rewrite equation (6) based on the polynomial function, the 

following equation is used:

Each of the summation terms in (7) can be considered as a 

linear regression equation [26] and can be rewritten as:

including  the  neural  networks,  fuzzy  neural  systems,  wavelet 
transform,  spline  functions,  and  polynomial  functions,  etc. 
Here, one of the simplest types of the function 
 has been 
selected,  which  is  the  polynomial  function  [26].  In  order  to 
model JL-DG-MOSFET, the proposed N-AR model creates a 
nonlinear mapping between input parameters including channel 
length (L), damaged channel length (Ld), silicon thickness (tsi) , 
the  thickness  of  the  oxide  (tox),  the  central  voltage  (VC),  the 
drain  voltage  (VD),  to  generate  the  output  parameter,  the 
threshold voltage (VT), which will be described in Section IV in 
details. 

and 

 is the vector of unknown parameters of the model. Also, 

M is equal to all k combinations of the set m without repetition 
such that m is the number of inputs and k = 1, 2,  ..., m. Here, M 
can be obtained as: 

 Let's consider (8) in the matrix form: 

(9) 

(10) 

where  based  on  the  polynomial  function  of  (7),  the  matrix 

will be defined as (11). 

(11) 

The  goal  in  here  is  to  find  the  vector  of  unknown 
. Since there is always some error 
parameters, i.e., the vector 
cannot  be 
associated  with  any  modeling,  the  vector 
determined. Due to the error of the model, the values inside the 
vector  also  have  a  negligible  amount  of  error.  Hence,  the 

resulting vector is called approximated 

, or 

. To estimate 

the vector 

, the expression 

 should be minimized. 

According to the least mean squares (LMS) method, to solve 
this,  the  conditions  of  the  normal  equation  (12)  must  be 
satisfied. 

Accordingly, the vector 

is calculated as 

 (12) 

         (13) 

So far, the usual calculation process for finding the vector 

 is described. However, here, the matrix 

is very large, 

and  this  issue  increases  the  computational  load  of  the  model 

greatly,  especially  in  the  case  of  matrix  inverting.  In  the 
following,  an  algebraic  method  is  proposed  to  reduce  the 
computational complexity of the utilized model. 

III.  THE METHOD OF GRAM-SCHMIDT ORTHOGONALIZATION 

TO ESTIMATE VECTOR 

In  this  section,  we  start  by  dividing  the  matrix  P  into  the 

product of two matrixes, as: 

where  A  is  a 

upper-triangular  matrix  and  W  is  an

 matrix whose columns are orthogonal. Hence, 

constructs a diagonal matrix called D.

The  decomposition  of  the  Gram-Schmidt  orthogonalization 
method  eliminates  the  inverting  process  of  matrix  P,  and  the 
model should only deal with the simple process of inverting the 
matrix  A.  Consequently,  the  computational  burden  is  greatly 
reduced.  This  simplicity  is  due  to  the  lattice  structure  of  the 
matrix A. For example, it can be shown that the inverse of an 
upper-triangular matrix is an upper-triangular matrix, and the 
determinant of an upper-triangular matrix is obtained only by 
calculating the multiplication of its diagonal elements. Also, the 
diagonal elements of the inverse of the matrix A are the inverse 
of its diagonal elements  [27].

As  mentioned  before,  according  to  the  analytical  model 
presented in [6], it is needed to use the parameters L, Ld, tsi, tox, 
VC and VD to calculate the threshold voltage, VT.  By using (6) 
to solve the threshold voltage estimation, the following relation 
is resulted:

routine 

Typically,  there  are  three  basic  stages  in  a  system 
identification 
including  data  creation,  model 
determination,  and  validation  [28,  29].  Model  determination 
stage  was  explained  in  the  previous  sections.  In  this  section, 
based on simulated data obtained from the analytical method of 
[6], the validation stage is investigated. Based on Eq (23) the 
proposed  model  has  6  inputs,  and  if  we  want  to  involve  all 
values of all inputs in training procedure we need to burden a 
very high computational load and it is not acceptable for our 
model,  hence  to  solve  this  problem  the  proposed  model  is 
trained by a discrete sequence of the random numbers sampled 
from the proper range of inputs. Testing results will show that 
this  training  approach  using  sampled  random  numbers  is  a 
proper  solution.  For  model  validation,  the  trained  model  has 
been  tested  by  the  discrete  sampled  sequence  of  chirp, 
sinusoidal  and  quasi-triangular  (Q-Triangular)  datasets  (Figs. 
 the 
3-8).  Here  the  main  inputs  are 

,  and 

calculated VT (in Volt) using the method of [6] is output. The 
constant values (tox, tsi, L, and Ld) have also been swept to cover 
more variability  in  the  model  validation  and  making  sure  the 
proposed model can work under the verity of variations. In this 
study tox, tsi, L, and Ld have been swept in the /ranges of [1, 4]nm,

For quantitative evaluation of the precision of the proposed 
method, a numerical criterion is used. The first criterion is the 
percentage of Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE%). The 
calculated NMSE% between the proposed model and analytical 
one is 0.435% on average, which indicates that the error of the 
proposed model is negligible and it can be a proper alternative 
for  the  method  of  [6]  (Woo’s  model).  The  next  argument  in 
evaluating the proposed model is the speed of the algorithm, as 
compared to that of [6]. Thus, both methods are simulated on 
an ASUS laptop with an Intel Corei5 processor with 4 GB of 
RAM  using  MATLAB  software,  and  the  runtimes  of  the 
algorithms are measured. Table 1 compares the runtime of the 
method of [6] (RTWoo) with the runtime of the proposed model 
(RTP) for different datasets, including the chirp, sinusoidal and 
quasi-triangular  signal  (Q-Triangular)  signals,  as  well  as  the 
mean result. In order to compare the methods, merit called the 
Speed-Up Ratio (SUR) is defined, as 

(25) 

As shown in Table 1, the mean value of SUR over different 
tests  is  313.  Hence,  on  average,  the  proposed  method  is  313 
times  faster  than  the  method  of  [6],  which  shows  the 
effectiveness of the proposed technique.

V.  CONCLUSION 

A  method  for  calculation  of  the  threshold  voltage  of 
Junctionless Double-Gate MOSFETs has been proposed using 
a MISO Nonlinear Autoregressive (N-AR) model. This method 
is equipped to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization approach, and 
it can reduce the high computational load, due to considering 
the  effect  of  DIBL  in  analytical  methods.  Therefore,  the 
proposed  method  can  effectively  increase  the  speed  of 
integrated  circuits  simulation  tools.  Numerically,  it  is  shown 
that, on average, the proposed method is almost 313 times faster 
than  the  similar  analytical  model,  with  a  good  accuracy.  The 
proposed  method  is  not  only  limited  to  the  JL-DG-MOSFET 
modeling, and it can be used to model other devices.
