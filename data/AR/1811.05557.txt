A Two-Sided-Loop X-Ray Solar Coronal Jet Driven by a
Miniﬁlament Eruption

Alphonse C. Sterling1, Louise K. Harra2, Ronald L. Moore1,3, & David A. Falconer1,3

ABSTRACT

Most of the commonly discussed solar coronal jets are of the type consisting
of a single spire extending approximately vertically from near the solar surface
into the corona. Recent research supports that eruption of a miniature ﬁlament
(miniﬁlament) drives many such single-spire jets, and concurrently generates a
miniﬂare at the eruption site. A diﬀerent type of coronal jet, identiﬁed in X-
ray images during the Yohkoh era, are two-sided-loop jets, which extend from a
central excitation location in opposite directions, along low-lying coronal loops
more-or-less horizontal to the surface. We observe such a two-sided-loop jet from
the edge of active region (AR) 12473, using data from Hinode XRT and EIS,
and SDO AIA and HMI. Similar to single-spire jets, this two-sided-loop jet
results from eruption of a miniﬁlament, which accelerates to over 140 km s−1
before abruptly stopping after striking overlying nearly-horizontal loop ﬁeld at
∼30,000 km altitude and producing the two-sided-loop jet. Analysis of EIS raster
scans show that a hot brightening, consistent with a small ﬂare, develops in the
aftermath of the eruption, and that Doppler motions (∼40 km s−1) occur near the
jet-formation region. As with many single-spire jets, the magnetic trigger here is
apparently ﬂux cancelation, which occurs at a rate of ∼4×1018 Mx/hr, compa-
rable to the rate observed in some single-spire AR jets. An apparent increase in
the (line-of-sight) ﬂux occurs within minutes of onset of the miniﬁlament erup-
tion, consistent with the apparent increase being due to a rapid reconﬁguration
of low-lying ﬁeld during and soon after miniﬁlament-eruption onset.

Introduction

Coronal jets are transient collimated ejections of solar material, typically of length
<
∼105 km and width ∼104 km. They were ﬁrst observed in detail in X-rays with the Yohkoh
Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) (Shibata et al. 1992; Shimojo et al. 1996). Later they were stud-
ied with the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Hinode (Cirtain et al. 2007; Savcheva et al. 2007).
More recently they have been studied in EUV with the STEREO spacecraft (e.g. Nistic`o
2009), and with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) (e.g. Moore et al. 2013; Sterling et al. 2015). There are many additional jet studies
with a variety of instruments (Raouaﬁ et al. 2016).

Typical jets consist of a bright base near the solar surface, with a single spire extending
progressively outward from near the solar surface into the corona. (Shibata et al. 1994 called
these “anemone jets”; here we will refer to them as “single-spire jets.”) It was ﬁrst suggested
that such jets result according to an “emerging-ﬂux model,” whereby a magnetic bipole
emerges from below the solar surface into the corona and undergoes magnetic reconnection
with surrounding open (or far-reaching) nearly vertical ﬁeld, with the jet spire forming along
that open ﬁeld (e.g., Shibata et al. 1992; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995). Later however, im-
proved resolution and wavelength coverage with AIA showed that many (if not most) jets in-
stead result from eruption of a miniature ﬁlament, or “miniﬁlament,” of size scale ∼10,000 km
(Sterling et al. 2015; also see, e.g., Shen et al. 2012a, Adams et al. 2014, Panesar et al. 2016),
accompanied by a “miniﬂare” brightening at the edge of the jet base (this brightening
is sometimes called a jet(-base) bright point, or JBP; e.g. Sterling et al. 2015). Mean-
improved magnetic ﬁeld coverage with SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
while,
(HMI) showed that often jets coincide with magnetic ﬂux cancelation (e.g., Huang et al.
2012; Young & Muglach 2014; Adams et al. 2014); in some cases where ﬂux emergence co-
incides with the jets, the jets still originate from locations where one pole of the emerging
bipole is canceling with surrounding ﬁeld (e.g. Shen et al. 2012a; Li et al. 2015). From
the “miniﬁlament-eruption-model” standpoint, the ﬂux cancelation builds the miniﬁlament-
holding magnetic ﬁeld (Panesar et al. 2017), and triggers it to erupt (Panesar et al. 2016,
2018) to form the jet.

In addition to single-spire jets, there are also two-sided-loop coronal jets (Shibata et al.

– 3 –

1994), whereby two spires develop roughly symmetrically and horizontally to the surface from
a central bright region. These two-sided-loop jets were ﬁrst seen in coronal X-ray images,
and are also seen in EUV images (e.g. Alexander & Fletcher 1999; Jiang et al. 2013). The
emerging-ﬂux model was also invoked to explain these jets theoretically, with the emerging
ﬂux reconnecting with overlying horizontally directed ﬁeld, and numerical simulations of this
showed results similar to the Yohkoh/SXT X-ray observations (Yokoyama & Shibata 1995,
1996). Published examples of SDO-era observations, with high-resolution and high-cadence
multi-wavelength images and magnetograms, of these two-sided-loop jets are sparse (see
however §4 for recent references). Here we present Hinode and SDO observations showing
strong evidence that a two-sided-loop jet resulted from an erupting miniﬁlament, similar to
that in single-spire jets.

2.

Instrumentation and Data

Our observed two-sided-loop jet occurred on 2015 December 30 near 22:41 UT, southeast
of a set of sunspots in NOAA active region (AR) 12473 that was located at heliocentric
latitude and longitude of about -20, +45, producing a C-level enhancement in the GOES
X-ray ﬂux.

We use imaging data from both XRT and AIA. We conﬁrm that it is an “X-ray jet”
with XRT, assuring that we are studying a two-sided-loop jet similar to those identiﬁed by
Shibata et al. (1994) in X-rays with SXT. XRT has spatial pixel resolution of 1′′.02, with
variable time cadence and ﬁeld of view (FOV) (Golub et al. 2007). AIA produces full-Sun
images in seven EUV bands at 12 s cadence with 0′′.6 pixels (Lemen et al. 2012); for this
study we examined all EUV channels, and the 1600 ˚A UV channel. For our purposes here,
we ﬁnd it adequate to present 304 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, and 94 ˚A images (and their 12-s-cadence
movies), which respectively have peak contributions at 5 × 104, 1.6 × 106, 2.0 × 106 K, and
6.3 × 106 K. We also use raster-image data from the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer
(EIS, Culhane et al. 2007) in the He ii 304 ˚A, Fe xii 195 ˚A, and Fe xv 284 ˚A lines. Each scan
required ∼3.5 min to cover an E-W extent of ∼50′′, with a N-S slit extent of ∼120′′. There
was a fortuitous overlap with the jet event in the southwest quadrant of EIS’s limited FOV.
We also use magnetograms from HMI (Scherrer et al. 2012), which has maximum cadence
45 s and 0′′.5 pixels.

3. Observational Results

3.1. X-Ray and EUV Evolution

Figures 1(a—b) show the two-sided-loop jet in XRT images with classic morphology
(Shibata et al. 1994; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995, 1996) in X-rays, with a strong brightening
in-between the two loop-conﬁned arms (spires) of the jet; the accompanying video shows the
jet’s evolution. These Hinode/XRT images are very close in appearance to the snapshot from
Yohkoh/SXT in Yokoyama & Shibata (1995) (see Fig. 3(b) of that paper; the ﬁgure is also in
Shibata et al. 1994). Both the Yokoyama & Shibata (1995) jet and our jet have one side that
is smaller and brighter (to the south in the Yokoyama & Shibata 1995 jet, and to the north-
east in ours), and one side that is larger and dimmer (north in Yokoyama & Shibata 1995,
and southeast in ours). Viewing the movie accompanying our Figure 1(a—b), the frame at
22:46:10 UT comes closest in appearance to the snapshot in the Yokoyama & Shibata (1995)
ﬁgure (we choose to show diﬀerent frames in our Fig. 1(a,b) because of the strong saturation
of the ﬂaring location in that 22:46:10 UT frame). As with the original observations with
Yohkoh however, the X-ray images alone yield little direct information on the cause of the
jet. We look to additional data for more insight.

Figures 1(d—f) show the jet with AIA 94 ˚A images, with an initial brightening in
Figure 1(d) (also visible in X-rays in Fig. 1(a)) the two-sided-loop jet structure in Figure 1(e),
and a closeup in 1(f). Arrows in 1(e) point to oppositely directed ﬂows along two strands of
the two jet-guiding lobes. Figures 1(g—h) show the event in AIA 193 ˚A, with arrows in 1(g)
showing the elevated ﬁeld that later becomes one of the jet-guiding lobes. Figure 1(i) shows
a closeup of the region that brightens at the earliest sign of jet activity, with a ﬁlament-like
absorbing feature (arrows) that the accompanying video shows to be erupting. The erupting
segment (black arrow) has length of >
∼15′′ (≈11,000 km). This is similar to the size (8000 km)
Sterling et al. (2015) found for erupting miniﬁlaments when they were at about the same
relative distance above the surface as the in Figure 1(i). This is smaller than the sizes of
typical ﬁlaments (∼30,000—110,000 km; Parenti 2014). Thus, just as with the more typical
“single-spire” jets, this two-sided-loop jet apparently results from an erupting miniﬁlament.
From the accompanying videos, the jet forms when this erupting miniﬁlament collides with
pre-existing overlying ﬁeld shown by arrows in Figure 1(g).

Figure 2 shows AIA 94 ˚A images with a larger FOV than Figure 1, thereby revealing
more clearly the overall jet structure. After an initial brightening (red arrow in Figs. 2(a,c)),
the jetting into the two lobes eventually extends out asymmetrically from that brightening,
longer toward the southeast and shorter toward the northwest (Fig. 2(c)). We see the
southeast lobe develop in time in a similar fashion in several AIA wavelengths; in these 94 ˚A

– 5 –

images the jet-spire brightening in the lobe indicated by the white arrow in Figure 2(b)
extends away from the initiation site at ∼550±100 km s−1. In contrast, the northeast lobe
appears to brighten mostly in place, and therefore seems to be mostly a result of material
entering into the passband of sensitivity for the 94 ˚A wavelength channel as it heats or cools,
rather than arising from a front propagating along the ﬁeld to ﬁll the loop. Because of the
diﬀerences in temperature response in the 94 ˚A EUV of AIA (Lemen et al. 2012) and the
broad-band X-rays of XRT (Golub et al. 2007), jets can appear diﬀerently in the diﬀerent
wavelength regimes (cf. Sterling et al. 2015). This is the case here, with for example the
northwestern lobe of the jet clearly visible from the earliest XRT images (22:44:09 UT), while
it does not appear until substantially later in 94 ˚A (orange arrow in Fig. 2(c)). Evolution of
the southwest lobe is similar in X-rays to that in 94 ˚A, with ﬂows along the lobe ﬁeld from
the central region visible over 22:44—22:48 UT, approximately coinciding with the ﬂows
visible in the 94 ˚A images.

Two-sided-loop jets (and single-spire jets too, for that matter) were originally deﬁned
from X-ray images, and thus the images expected to match most closely those in the sketches
of Shibata et al. (1994) and Yokoyama & Shibata (1995, 1996) are those of Figure 1(a)
and 1(b), although unfortunately this appearance is compromised somewhat by the lim-
ited FOV of our XRT images in Figure 1.

Figure 3 shows a zoomed-in view of the erupting miniﬁlament, this time in AIA 304 ˚A
images. Over some time the miniﬁlament becomes visible near the surface (Fig. 3(a)).
Figure 3(b) shows a brightening beneath the miniﬁlament as it has just started to rise;
this brightening is visible in all AIA channels, and so includes hot emissions. A short time
later (Fig. 3(c)), the brightenings have become much more pronounced. Moreover, the
miniﬁlament itself now shows a contorted, serpentine-like shape – likely due to writhing –
as it erupts away from the surface (Fig. 3(d)). At the time of Figure 3(e), the erupting and
expanding miniﬁlament reaches the pre-existing overlying ﬁeld shown by the white arrows in
Figure 1(g), and by light blue arrows here in Figures 3(d—f). From the corresponding movie,
upon pushing into the overlying ﬁeld, the miniﬁlament appears to show untwisting motions
over approximately 22:44—22:48 UT. Along with and continuing after this unwinding, ﬂows
toward the northwest occur from the erupting miniﬁlament (green arrow in Figs. 3(e—
f)). Also, the overlying feature (light-blue arrows) shows distinct ﬂows southeastward from
approximately the time it is impacted by the erupting miniﬁlament ﬁeld, at about 22:45 UT,
and continuing until about 22:51 UT in the movie. These features are also visible in the
other AIA EUV channels; see the videos accompanying Figure 1.

Figure 4 shows the trajectory of the erupting miniﬁlament as a function of time, where
we have visually estimated the top of the miniﬁlament as it moves upward in 211 ˚A images

– 6 –

(Fig. 1(i)). We perform each length measurement three independent times to estimate the
random uncertainty in the measured value. Upward movement of the central part of the
ﬁlament commences near 22:34 UT, indicated by the upward-pointing arrow. This is the
time of the initial brightening at the base of the miniﬁlament indicated by the green arrow
in Figure 3(b); it is also visible in other AIA videos accompanying Figure 1, for example in
94 ˚A video of Figure 1(f) from 22:34:24, and especially at 22:35:24 UT. In Figure 4 the green
curve represents the AIA 94 ˚A ﬂux integrated over the region of the box in Figure 1(d), but
the 22:34:24 UT ﬂux increase visible in the video is too weak, relative to the background
intensity, to stand out in the green light curve. (The enhanced background intensity in 94 ˚A
images, visible as a hump in the green curve of Fig. 4 that peaks near 22:30 UT, is caused by
other dynamical processes that we do not investigate here.) From about 22:40 UT there is a
sharp increase in the rise trajectory of the miniﬁlament, and this corresponds to an increase
in the 94 ˚A integrated intensity (down-pointing arrow in Fig. 4, visible over 22:39—22:41 UT
in the video accompanying Fig. 1(f)), and then a further acceleration of the miniﬁlament
near 22:42 UT, indicated by the velocity plot (orange) in Figure 4, which is also accompanied
by a sharp increase in the integrated 94 ˚A intensity. This latter-most sharp increase in the
94 ˚A intensity can be considered to be the growth of a small ﬂare arcade accompanying the
accelerated rise of the miniﬁlament.

This behavior of the miniﬁlament’s rise, with slow-rise phases prior to the most-accelerated

rise, EUV brightening enhancements accompanying accelerations in the rise trajectory, and
onset of strongest ﬂaring accompanying the strongest miniﬁlament upward acceleration, all
closely mimic behavior of larger-scale erupting ﬁlaments and their accompanying ﬂares (e.g.,
Sterling & Moore 2005; Sterling, Harra, & Moore 2007; Sterling et al. 2014; Imada, Bamba, & Kusano
2014; McCauley et al. 2015; Harra et al. 2017; Green et al. 2018).

From Figure 4, the miniﬁlament erupts outward until it reaches a height (displacement)
of about 23,000 km, when it abruptly stops, apparently arrested by overlying ﬁeld that
is visible even prior to the jet (arrows in Fig. 1(g)). Due to the projection angle, the
true height might be ∼30% larger than these plane-of-sky-projected values, as the event
occurred at an angle of ∼45◦ with the Earth-Sun line-of-sight; so the height is ∼30,000 km.
Comparison with previous studies of ejective eruptions (e.g., Sterling et al. 2014) suggest
that the miniﬁlament’s rise is relatively unimpeded until the abrupt velocity decrease near
22:44 UT, when videos accompanying Figure 1 indicate that it pushes into overlying magnetic
ﬁeld.

3.2. EIS Rasters

Figure 5 shows an EIS raster intensity image in He ii (Fig. 5(a)), and a ratio of Fe xv-to-
Fe xii intensity images (Fig. 5(b)). These ratio images provide a qualitative measure of hotter
(brighter) and cooler (darker) locations in the region (Doschek et al. 2007). Figure 5(c) shows
contours from Figure 5(b) on an AIA 193 image. The rectangle in Figure 1(i) shows that
the EIS FOV covers only a small portion of the jet’s base region.

Figure 5(a) shows a dark feature (light-blue arrow) and a bright feature (black arrow),
which correspond to cooler and hotter locations in Figure 5(b). Comparing these features
with the AIA features in the zoomed-in videos corresponding to Figures 1(f), 1(i), and 3
suggests that the dark feature could be a void; see for example the Figure 3 304 ˚A video
between 22:42 and 22:45 UT, where there seems to be a region comparatively free of emitting
material between the erupting miniﬁlament and the photosphere at the location of the EIS
dark feature. For the bright feature (black arrow in Fig. 5(a)), comparison with the same
videos shows convincingly that this region corresponds to ﬂare loops that develop below the
erupting miniﬁlament; see for example the 211 ˚A movie corresponding to Figure 1(f) from
about 22:50 UT, when the features at this location take on the distinct appearance of post-
ﬂare loops. Unfortunately however, the EIS scans did not capture the erupting miniﬁlament
at a time when it was most clearly visible in the AIA images, such as in Figure 1(i). There is
only one EIS scan coinciding with times where AIA shows the miniﬁlament very clearly in the
EIS FOV; that at 22:42:18 UT. But that scan has a data dropout near the jet region, and so
we are not conﬁdent in that scan. At the time of the prior raster (22:38:44 UT), the miniﬁl-
ament has not yet started lifting oﬀ, and by the time of the next scan (22:45:52 UT), hotter
material envelopes the miniﬁlament, apparent in the AIA videos accompanying Figure 1.
So what we can say with certainty from the EIS rasters is that they show: (a) brightening
beneath the erupting miniﬁlament, (b) temperature-ratio maps showing hotter plasma at the
expected small-ﬂare location, and (c) Doppler velocities from single-Gaussian ﬁts in several
rasters show redshifts, and one raster (beginning at 22:45:52) shows a strongly blueshifted
feature too (both red- and blueshifts have maximums of ∼40 km s−1); we consider these line
shifts further in §4.

3.3. Magnetic Evolution

Figure 1(c) shows an HMI magnetogram of the region, and Figure 1(h) shows it overlaid
onto an AIA 193 ˚A image. From the latter panel and accompanying video, the miniﬁlament
eruption clearly occurs on a magnetic neutral line.

– 8 –

Figure 6 shows the positive-polarity ﬂux summed over the box in Figure 1(c) for the 36
hrs beginning at 0 UT on December 30. There is a general ﬂux decrease over that time period
of ∼4×1018 Mx/hr, in agreement for ﬂux-cancelation rates found in (single-spire) AR jets (see
Table 1 of Sterling et al. 2018). There is however a prominent jump of about 4×1019 Mx over
∼15 min, beginning nearly exactly with the onset of the miniﬁlament’s eruption. This does
not have the appearance of ﬂux emergence; if it were emergence, the emergence rate during
the jump would be at or above ∼1×1020 Mx/hr, which is the approximate maximum rate of
AR growth (Zwaan 1987); the magnetograms show no indication of such large emergence.
Instead we suspect that we are seeing an increase in the line-of-sight component of the ﬁeld
as the ﬁeld vector at the surface changes its direction as the miniﬁlament erupts; the positive-
polarity roots of that ﬁeld were oriented such that in response to the eruption, the direction
of the ﬁeld turned toward our observation direction, perhaps a natural consequence of the our
perspective of viewing the region near the west limb (see discussion of Fig. 7 below). Similar
magnetic rapid reconﬁgurations have been seen in ﬂares (e.g., Moore et al. 1984; Wang et al.
1994). Also supportive of this hypothesis is the continuation of ﬂux decrease with time for
more than 12 hrs following the jet (Fig. 6). Hence, the evidence is that ﬂux cancelation
triggered the miniﬁlament’s eruption that drove the two-sided-loop jet, consistent with ﬂux
cancelation triggering many or most single-sided jets (e.g., Panesar et al. 2016, 2017, 2018;
Sterling et al. 2016, 2017).

4. Summary and Discussion

We ﬁnd a two-sided-loop jet to result from eruption of a miniature ﬁlament. This is
consistent with earlier observations that miniﬁlament eruptions cause single-spire jets. In
this case, the erupting miniﬁlament reached a velocity of ∼140 km s−1 prior to impacting and
reconnecting with an overlying, roughly horizontal portion of a sigmoid coronal-loop ﬁeld at
a height of ∼30,000 km. Reconnection between the erupting miniﬁlament (more speciﬁcally:
the erupting-miniﬁlament ﬂux-rope ﬁeld that holds the cool miniﬁlament material) and that
horizontal-loop ﬁeld resulted in heating at the reconnection location, and expulsion of X-
ray/EUV jets in both directions along the loop, producing the two-sided-loop jet. EIS raster
scans conﬁrm accentuated heating at the suspected small-ﬂare location, and line-of-sight
magnetogram observations are consistent with ﬂux cancelation being the trigger for onset of
the miniﬁlament’s eruption.

Figure 7 shows a schematic of our miniﬁlament-eruption scenario for producing this
two-sided-loop jet. The miniﬁlament ﬂux rope writhes as it erupts, allowing reconnection at
the elevated location (Fig. 7(b)). This schematic is topologically the same as that drawn for

– 9 –

single-spire jets in Sterling et al. (2015), but with the “open” ﬁeld now the long horizontal
loop, running from right-to-left in the ﬁgure (northwest-to-southeast in the observed jet in
Fig. 1).

Figure 7 also illustrates, with the purple arrows, our idea for the positive-ﬂux jump at
and soon after the time of miniﬁlament-eruption onset. These arrows represent the direction
of the positive component of the photospheric ﬁeld inside the footpoint of the miniﬁlament
loop (in the ﬁgures, for clarity we draw the arrows just outside of the miniﬁlament loop).
Prior to the eruption of the miniﬁlament, the direction of the ﬁeld vector in the miniﬁlament’s
positive-polarity ﬂux patch is approximately vertical to the surface. Within a few minutes
following the miniﬁlament-eruption’s onset however, the foot of the positive-polarity ﬁeld
that undergoes the ﬂare-arcade-building reconnection points more toward the upper left of
the schematic: In other words, after the eruption’s onset, the purple arrow in Figure 7(b) is
no longer vertical, as it was in Figure 7(a); rather, it is now leaning slightly couter-clockwise
to the normal to the surface, pointing to the southeast (in the plane of the ﬁgure). This
is a result of the reconnecting ﬁeld beneath the erupting miniﬁlament collapsing in upon
itself.
(We speculate that this photospheric-ﬁeld-direction change could be a byproduct
of the so-called “Hudson eﬀect,” from the work of Hudson 2000; e.g. Janse & Low 2007,
Shen et al. 2012b, Panesar et al. 2013, Wheatland et al. 2018.) To an observer viewing from
the upper left of the schematic, the measured intensity of the line-of-sight component of
the foot of that positive-polarity ﬁeld would increase between the times of Figures 7(a) and
7(b). Because the left side of the schematic represents southeast in the solar images of this
paper, and because the region appears near the solar west limb viewed from HMI, the purple
arrow pointing more toward the upper left in ﬁgure 7(b) compared to 7(a) is qualitatively
consistent with the observed positive-ﬂux increase during the time of miniﬁlament eruption.
This same process would aﬀect the negative-ﬂux values also, but as mentioned earlier, we do
not measure the negative ﬂux here because it is diﬃcult to isolate. While further investigation
of this idea is beyond the scope of the current paper, this scenario plausibly explains how
there could be the observed increase in the line-of-sight positive ﬂux starting at the time of
the jet onset shown in Figure 6.

Overall, we observe persistent ﬂux cancelation over the time leading up to the jet. Thus
our ﬁndings are fully consistent with other recent studies showing that miniﬁlaments that
erupt to form jets are frequently built by ﬂux cancelation, and that continued cancelation
triggers them to erupt; see Panesar et al. (2016, 2017, 2018) for schematic illustrations on
how this build up and triggering might occur. And see e.g., Sterling et al. (2015, 2017) for
schematic illustrations on how the erupting miniﬁlament would form the jet.

EIS’s ﬁeld-of-view (Fig. 5(d); also see the white box in Fig. 1(i)) covers the location

– 10 –

just to the east of the interaction location of the erupting miniﬁlament and overlying ﬁeld.
In Figure 5(d), the lineshifts labeled R2 are located near the AIA-ﬂare-loop tops, so if they
were due to downﬂows from the tops of those loops, we would expect a mixture of red-
shifts and blueshifts; but we see only redshifts here.
Instead, the R2 redshifts are more
consistent with material trapped in contracting reconnected closed ﬁeld, producing “supra-
arcade downﬂows,” (e.g., McKenzie 2000; Savage & McKenzie 2011; Warren et al. 2011;
Savage et al. 2012), which have minimum velocities near ﬂare loop tops close to those ob-
served here (∼40 km s−1). Hence we expect the source of these redshifts to be diﬀerent from
those seen by EIS in AR loops (e.g., Del Zanna 2008; Doschek 2012).

For the R1/B1-labeled red/blue pair of Doppler shifts in Figure 5(d), which also reach
∼40 km s−1, Figure 3(e—f) and the accompanying video (and also other AIA videos from
Fig. 1 showing the miniﬁlament-eruption region close up) show that complex dynamics en-
sue when the miniﬁlament pushes into the overlying horizontal ﬁeld. As mentioned in the
discussion of Figure 3 in §3.1 above, the erupting miniﬁlament shows what appears to be
untwisting motions (this would correspond to the miniﬁlament ﬂux rope with blue shading
in Fig. 7(b)), along with northwestward-directed motions (green arrow in Figs. 3(e—f), and
also southeastward-directed motions along the overlying horizontal ﬁeld (light-blue arrows in
Figs. 3(d—f). Of course “northwestward” and “southeastward” only describe plane-of-sky
motions, but we could expect corresponding components either into or out of the plane of
sky also. EIS is apparently observing Doppler shifts from these opposite-directed motions;
thus the shifts could be from some combination between the possible untwisting motions
(as reported in, e.g., Williams et al. 2009) and the observed counterstreaming. Due to the
limited FOV coverage and the limited number of scans however, we are not able to specify
more exactly what is the cause of the Doppler shifts (including for example, whether EIS is
able to resolve the red and blueshifts due to the untwisting motion alone). Observations of
similar events with improved spectral coverage should clarify what occurs in situations such
as these.

Recent models of the miniﬁlament jet-producing mechanism (Wyper et al. 2017,
Wyper, DeVore, & Antiochos 2018) argue that “breakout reconnection” at a coronal mag-
netic null point between the pre-eruption ﬁeld enveloping the miniﬁlament and an ambient
(nearly vertical) coronal ﬁeld is essential for initiating miniﬁlament eruptions that produce
single-spire jets. While this may hold for the single-spire jets they modeled, initial break-
out reconnection appears not to be essential in the two-sided-loop jet presented here; the
miniﬁlament ﬂux-rope eruption undergoes clear acceleration before the overlying ﬁeld (where
“breakout” reconnection eventually occurred at the interface) abruptly stops its motion
(Fig. 5). Thus the possibility remains that tether-cutting (e.g. Moore & LaBonte 1980), or
an ideal MHD instability (e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005), prior to breakout might be the primary

– 11 –

initiation mechanism for this miniﬁlament eruption.

In summary, our view for this two-sided-loop jet is that (a) magnetic ﬂux cancelation
built the miniﬁlament ﬁeld and triggered it to erupt, (b) the erupting miniﬁlament ﬁeld
pushed up into largely horizontally oriented pre-existing magnetic ﬁeld, (c) the two-sided-
loop jet spires developed due to reconnection between the erupting miniﬁlament ﬁeld and
the overlying ﬁeld.

Additionally, the central brightening in our event corresponds to the JBP of single-spire
jets, and is a miniature ﬂare that accompanied the erupting miniﬁlament; it is analogous to
large-scale ﬂares accompanying typical-sized ﬁlament eruptions according to the standard
ﬂare model (e.g., Hirayama 1974; Shibata et al. 1995; Moore et al. 2001). Brightening of the
horizontal jet loops would be due to a combination of heating of material at the reconnection
location, density increase from evaporation from the near and far ends of the reconnected
far-reaching loops, and density increase from leakage onto the horizontal segments of material
in the erupting miniﬁlament ﬁeld (including miniﬁlament material itself).

While there are now numerous examples of miniﬁlament eruptions driving (single-spire)
coronal jets (e.g., Shen et al. 2012a; Liu et al. 2015; Moore et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2016;
Zhang et al. 2016; Sterling et al. 2015; Panesar et al. 2016), it is necessary to study more
than this single example of a two-sided-loop jet before we might conclude that two-sided-loop
jets in general are also driven by miniﬁlament eruptions, as other recent observation do not
discuss erupting miniﬁlaments in two-sided-loop jet formation (Tian et al. 2017; Zheng et al.
2018). Therefore more studies are needed to determine the most common cause of two-sided-
loop jets.

Fig. 2.— AIA 94 ˚A images showing larger-ﬁeld-of-view perspective of the two-sided-loop jet of
Fig. 1. (a) After the initial brightening from the jet-initiation region (red arrow), a lobe of the jet
starts to appear (white arrow). (b) The lobe to the west continues to evolve toward the southeast
(white arrow). (c) The full structure of the two-sided-loop jet. One lobe extends to the southeast,
in this case along multiple ﬁeld lines, with the white and yellow arrows pointing to two such groups
of ﬁeld lines. A second lobe extends to the northwest (orange arrow); this lobe was prominent from
an earlier time in the jet’s development in the X-ray images (Fig. 1a, 1b), but is just now becoming
apparent in 94 ˚A. Jets such as these are called two-sided-loop jets due to their roughly symmetric
structure about the bright point at the initiation location (red arrow). Video 1d 1e shows this
sequence.

Fig. 3.— Smaller FOV of the event of Fig 1, showing in AIA 304 ˚A images the miniﬁlament
eruption leading to the two-sided-loop jet.
(a) Prior to the eruption the miniﬁlament becomes
visible very close to the surface (white arrows). (b) A brightening (green arrow) becomes visible
as the miniﬁlament starts to lift oﬀ at the incipient stage of its eruption. (c) As the eruption con-
tinues, the miniﬁlament takes on a serpentine shape, indicative of writhing. Brightenings continue
to increase and also to spread along the length of the miniﬁlament. (d, e) As the miniﬁlament
eruption continues, it impacts into overlying (presumably magnetic) structures that are oriented
approximately horizontal to the surface (light-blue arrows). (f) Upon striking the overlying struc-
ture, the miniﬁlament plasma is expelled in the northeast-southwest direction (green arrows in (e)
and (f)); in addition, ﬂows occur along the northwest-southeast-oriented ﬁeld that is horizontal to
the surface (light-blue arrows). These motions are apparent in the accompanying video.

Fig. 4.— Characteristics as functions of time of the miniﬁlament that erupts and drives the
two-sided-loop jet. (Black line). Height of top of miniﬁlament segment along the path of the black
ﬁducial line in Fig. 1(i). Error bars are 1σ uncertainties from three independent measurements. (Or-
ange) Velocities derived from the height trajectory (smoothed over four timesteps=48 s). (Green)
Intensity from AIA 94 ˚A channel, integrated over the region of the orange box in Fig. 1(d). The
arrow on the left shows the start of a pre-eruption rise in the miniﬁlament’s height. The arrow on
the right shows a minor peak in 94 ˚A intensity, which coincides with onset of a faster rise; the 94 ˚A
video accompanying Fig. 1 indicates a corresponding intensity brightening at the time for the left
arrow also, but that peak in not visible in the green curve due to enhanced background emission.

(a) Raster image in He ii 304 ˚A from the region of the
white box in Fig. 1(i), where the light-blue arrow shows a suspected void. (b) Image of the ratio
of Fe xv-to-Fe xii intensity rasters, providing an indication of relative temperatures, with bright
(brown contours) and dark (green contours) locations respectively representing hotter and cooler
(d) AIA 193 ˚A image with EIS
regions.
Fe xii Doppler contours at 10, 20, 30, and 40 km s−1, with red/blue representing red/blue shifts.
(Contours due to suspected noise have been removed from b–d.)

Fig. 6.— Positive magnetic ﬂux, measured over the box of Fig. 1(c). The orange line is at
22:40:08 UT, near the miniﬁlament-eruption-onset time. The insert plot is a closeup showing that
the jump in ﬂux value occurs very close to the time of the jet.

Fig. 7.— Schematic showing inferred production of the two-sided-loop jet. (a) Setup prior to jet
initiation, with the yellow curve representing the solar surface, black lines representing magnetic
ﬁeld lines, and the blue feature representing a cool miniﬁlament suspended low inside of a twisted
magnetic loop. Southeast is to the left and northwest to the right, in comparing with the obser-
vations in Figs. 1 and 5. (b) Upon erupting, the miniﬁlament ﬁeld writhes enough to reconnect
with the overlying ﬁeld. Red lines indicate reconnected ﬁeld and red X-es represent reconnection
locations. Reconnection also occurs between the legs of the writhing ﬁeld, producing the red-semi-
circular loop at the base; this is the brightening boxed in Fig. 1(d), and corresponds to the JBP
in the miniﬁlament-eruption picture of Sterling et al. (2015). The green arrows represent ﬂows in
both directions along the two-sided-loop jet. The purple arrows show the orientation of the positive
ﬁeld direction at the surface and inside of the erupting miniﬁlament loop, with the arrow drawn
outside of that loop for clarity. If, for example, the eruption is observed from the upper-left corner
with a line-of-sight magnetograph, this positive component of the ﬁeld will appear to be larger in
(b) than in (a), due to the ﬁeld direction changing during the eruption; this change might explain
the jump in measured positive magnetic ﬂux at the time of the miniﬁlament eruption displayed in
Fig. 6.
