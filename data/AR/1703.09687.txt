ON MULTICOLOR RAMSEY NUMBERS
FOR LOOSE k-PATHS OF LENGTH THREE

TOMASZ  LUCZAK, JOANNA POLCYN, AND ANDRZEJ RUCI ´NSKI

Abstract. We show that there exists an absolute constant A such
that for each k
2 and every coloring of the edges of the complete
k-uniform hypergraph on Ar vertices with r colors, one of the color
classes contains a loose path of length three.

The degree degH(v) of a vertex v in H equals the number of edges of
H which contain v. A star is a k-graph S with a vertex v contained
in all the edges of S. A star is full if it consists of all sets in
containing v, that is, in which degS(v) =

Let P (k) denote a loose k-uniform path (shortly, a k-path) of length
three, that is, the only connected k-graph on 3k
2 vertices with
three edges and no vertex of degree three. In this paper we study the
multicolor Ramsey number R(P (k); r) for P (k) deﬁned as the smallest
number n such that each coloring of the edges of the complete k-graph
K (k)
n with r colors leads to a monochromatic copy of P (k). In the graph
case, i.e. when k = 2, it is easy to see that the value of R(P ; r) is equal
and depends on the divisibility of r by
to 2r + cr, where cr ∈ {

So far, it has been veriﬁed only for k = 3 and r = 2, 3, . . . , 10 ([2, 3,

determined for paths of all lengths [7].

A general upper bound on R(P (k); r), k

application of Tur´an numbers. Indeed, it was proved by F¨uredi, Jiang,
n0(k) the unique largest P (k)-free k-graph on
and Seiver [1] that for n
n vertices is a full star which contains at most
edges. From this
it follows that for r large enough R(P (k); r)

main goal of this paper is to show that for r large enough R(P (k); r)/r

2. Proof of Theorem 1

In view of (2), we may restrict ourselves to k

two results on Tur´an numbers for loose k-paths of length two and three.

We begin by stating two elementary facts the short proofs of which

are provided for completeness.

Fact 5. Every hypergraph H contains a sub-hypergraph G with mini-
mum degree greater than |E(H)|
|V (H)| .

Proof. Deﬁne G as a subhypergraph of H which maximizes the ratio
|E(G)|

|V (G)| and has the smallest number of vertices. If for some v

deal with the case when F is small (Claim 11 below). Then there are
many vertices v with large links. Consequently, it is enough to ﬁnd in

are all Si’s; in fact each of them covers a majority of the vertices of H.
Thus, one can ﬁnd a (k

The sets W1, W2, W3 generate a corresponding partition of the proper
sets f into ‘colors’ Ci =
v∈Wi Fv. In order to complete the proof of
Proposition 10, it suﬃces to show that such a 3-coloring contains a
(k
1)-path of length three whose edges are colored with diﬀerent
colors. Such a path can be extended to a copy of P (k) in H, yielding a
contradiction.

Howeover, all sets Wi are so dense that the existence of such a path
is an easy consequence of Fact 5. Indeed, recall that in each color there
n−1
are at least 0.96k/(48k)
edges. Therefore, by Fact 5, in each color
