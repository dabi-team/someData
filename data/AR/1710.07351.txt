Nuclear reactions induced by muon neutrino with energies in the range from 0.2 to 1.5 GeV in Monte Carlo
calculations framework in the intra-nuclear cascade model are studied. This study was done by comparison
between the available experimental data and theoretical values of total cross section, and the energy distribution
of emitted lepton energy in the reaction muon neutrino-nucleus, using the targets: 12C, 16O, 27Al, 40Ar, 56Fe
and 208Pb. A phenomenological toy model of primary neutrino-nucleon interaction gives a good agreement
of our theoretical inclusive neutrino nucleus cross in comparison with the available experimental data. Some
interesting results on the behavior of the cross section as function of 1p-1n and higher contributions are also
sketched. The previous results on the percentage of fake events related in available experiments in 12C were
expanded for the set studied nuclei. With the increase of mass target, the nuclear effects in the cross sections
were observed along with the importance to take into account fake events in the reactions.

INTRODUCTION

The investigation of neutrino-nucleus interaction is a ﬁeld
that gained an increasing relevance in recent years allowing
studies on neutrino oscillation and the neutrino massiveness
[1]. Moreover, neutrino-nucleus interaction plays a key role
in Astrophysics issues such as supernova dynamics [2].

From the experimental side, a special difﬁculty faced in the
study of neutrino interactions is the fact that the neutrino en-
ergy is unknown, being described by broad energy distribu-
tions. This problem prevents the extraction of information
concerning to essential characteristics of neutrinos [1], which
requires their reconstruction ﬂuxes from ﬁnal states measure-
ments. Furthermore, ﬁnal states are strongly dependent on
nuclear properties and nuclear effects.

Within the treatment of weak interaction in the nuclear
medium appear complex processes due to the effects of nu-
clear structure and interactions between the various nucle-
ons. There are several theoretical models in the description of
neutrino-nucleus/nucleon cross sections. A few of them have
been implemented in computer numerical codes to simulate
the interactions in several neutrino experiments in progress.
Many of the used formalisms do not have a speciﬁc name,
and here we will distinguish them with the name of the nu-
merical code such as GENIE [3], NUANCE [4], between
others. Further, there is another, not yet implemented theoret-
ical formalism called Consistent Isobar Model-CIM [5, 6].

Many of these codes are using Monte Carlo (MC) proce-
dures to simulate the reactions in the nuclear cascade. Some

important notes are claimed by Ref. [1]: (i) presently avail-
able generators all rely on free-particle MC cascade simula-
tions that are applicable at very high energies with limited
applicability in the description of relatively low energy with
Final States Interactions (FSI) inside the target nuclei; (ii) it
is neglected the binding in nuclei and; (iii) some generators
are working with outdated nuclear physics and there is not an
internal consistency between the different reaction channels.

Another important task that the simulation program and
event generator should take into account is the elimination of
those so-called fake events, from secondary interactions that
introduce noise in the main channel. These secondary inter-
actions are into a more fundamental level of neutrino-nucleon
interaction theory, requiring a deep understanding of this in-
teraction. In many neutrino experiments are emitted neutrinos
by secondary decays of pions and kaons, usually produced in
high energy proton-nucleon/nucleus collisions. For example,
in the K2K (Kamioka to Kamioka) [7, 8] experiment a pro-
ton beam of 12.9 GeV collides against Al. In the MiniBooNE
experiment (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment) [10, 11], a
proton beam of 8.9 GeV collides against Be, forming the so-
called long-range beam Long Base Line (LBL). The beams
produced in LBL range, from hundreds of MeV to several
GeV, are detected hundreds of kilometers away. In this en-
ergy range, the dominant contribution to the neutrino-nucleus
cross section comes from reactions with charged current (CC)
in the channels: quasi-elastic (CCqe) and resonance (CCres)
production. There are currently several LBL type experiments
in progress, designed to determine the differences between the
masses of different kinds of neutrinos and oscillation param-
eters. In this work we do not analyze the effect on neutral
current on the target nuclei here studied, due that the CCqe
scattering is the dominant neutrino interaction process for νµ

 
 
 
 
 
 
and ¯νµ colliding with a nuclear target when the neutrino en-
ergies are on the order 1 GeV [13], On the other hand, Eric-
son et. al [14] have called the attention in the sense that νµ
neutral current could be necessary to solve the MiniBooNE
low-energy anomaly.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

The study of nuclear reactions must consider all relevant
effects due to the nuclear medium. In this paper, we used the
CRISP model for the calculation of nuclear reactions. The
CRISP code was developed to describe the most relevant nu-
clear processes realistically. In the following, are presented
the most important aspects regarding the nuclear medium.

neutrino-nucleon
(antineutrino-nucleon) interaction, where the weak charged
current induces a transition of neutrino (antineutrino) into
its corresponding lepton charged l− (l+), that results in the
signal of an event. The FSI may lead to more than one ejected
nucleon , plus a lepton , and resonances produced by absorp
tion of emitted pions can also lead to more ejected nucleons.
These last
the reconstruction of
energy and production of quasi-elastic fake events. Many
experiments try to reduce these uncertainties using a near
detector and implementing some correlation with the far main
detector. Nevertheless, there are no previous studies on how
the event generator manages these fake events other than the
works of Lalakulich and Mosel [15, 16] and alternatively,
Ericson et. al [14] in the quasi-elastic reaction of νµ−12C.

two contributions affect

In the present paper, we show recent developments on
the inclusion of neutrino-nuclear interaction in the CRISP
(Collaboration Rio-Ilh´eus-S˜ao Paulo) model [17]. CRISP is
a nuclear reaction model based on Quantum Dynamics (QD)
and Monte Carlo (MC) methods and has being developed for
the last two decades [17–21, 23]. CRISP provides reliable
descriptions of many-body interactions for photons and elec-
trons, for protons and neutrons, and has being applied to study
reactions in nuclei from 12C to 240Am. The incident parti-
cles can have energies from 50 MeV up to tens of GeV, and
many aspects of nuclear reaction can be investigated, such as
speciﬁc cross sections, particle multiplicity, and particle spec-
tra, between others. Additionally, the CRISP model has been
employed for the investigation of electron scattering [24],
meson production in nuclei [21], ultra-peripheral collisions
at LHC energies [23], and Λ non-mesonic decay in the nu-
clear medium [25, 26] using the smallest numbers of possible
free parameters. CRISP has not been used before to study
neutrino-nucleus interaction, then this work is the ﬁrst study
to this issue.

Further, it is a useful tool to study nuclear effects on dif-
ferent nuclear reactions, which is not the usual case for codes
built as event generators, where many parameters must be ad-
justed for speciﬁc reactions. In this paper, we focus on the
nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus reaction. For this purpose,
we ﬁrst include a simple toy model of the primary neutrino-
nucleon interaction in the CRISP code, and then analyze how
the nuclear effect modiﬁes the different observables.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II we describe
brieﬂy the CRISP model and introduce a simple toy model for
the neutrino-nucleon interaction that was coupled to CRISP
code. In section III, the results are presented and discussed.
Finally, in section IV we show our conclusions and ﬁnal re-
marks.

A. CRISP

QD method and MC method [17] are used in the CRISP
model to describe the nuclear processes that take place during
a nuclear reaction. In CRISP code, the target is constructed
as a Fermi gas where the Fermi energies for protons and neu-
trons, respectively, are

the momentum space is always generated, including the de-
grees of freedom related to spin. The respective Fermi mo-
menta for protons and neutrons are given by

The momentum space is divided into cells of width ∆p cal-

culated as

(4)

where Nl represents the number of levels in the Fermi gas. All
nucleons are evenly distributed inside the nuclear volume.

The nuclear reaction in the CRISP model is considered as
a two-step calculation process. The ﬁrst one is the intranu-
clear cascade, described by the Monte Carlo MultiCollisional
(MCMC) model [27]. The second step is the evaporation-
ﬁssion competition, described by Monte Carlo Evaporation-
Fission (MCEF) model [28, 29]. The emphasis of this work is
on the intranuclear cascade step since the particles of interest
(muon, muon neutrinos, and pions) are emitted only during
this step. For the sake of completeness, it must be mentioned
that in the evaporation-ﬁssion part the Weisskopf’s model is
used to describe the nuclear de-excitation process by succes-
sive evaporation of nucleons or by nuclear ﬁssion [20, 29–31].
In the case of ﬁssion, the fragments are generated following
the Random Neck Rupture Model (RNRM) [32] with sym-
metric, asymmetric and super-asymmetric channels [33, 34]
for the fragments formation. Besides, we include the evapo-
ration of hot ﬁssion fragments.

In the intranuclear cascade step, binary interactions only
can occur. The multicollisional approach implies that all nu-
cleons move simultaneously [27]. Such an approach makes
it natural to check dynamical aspects such as changes in the
nuclear density and the evolution of the occupancy levels of
the Fermi gas [17, 35]. The Fermi motion of nucleons, also
a result of this approach, modiﬁes the nuclear cross sections,
especially near the threshold of the interaction. The ordered
sequence of collisions considers the probability of interaction
with all particles, based on their respective cross sections.

The intranuclear cascade starts with the primary collision
when the incident particle interacts on the surface a nucleon
of the system or more internally in the nucleus. As a result,
secondary particles are produced which have relatively high
energy compared to the energy of the others nucleons in the
nuclear medium. These particles are called cascade particles.
The secondary particles propagate inside the nucleus and can
interact with other particles, or they can be emitted when reach
the nuclear surface just as their kinetic energy is higher than
the nuclear potential or, be reﬂected continuing their propaga-
tion in the nucleus. The nuclear potential is a square well such
that

V0 = EF + B,

(5)

where B is the binding energy, ∼ 8 MeV. The CRISP model
also considers the effect of tunneling of charged particles
through the Coulomb barrier.

The cascade is completed when there is no resonance yet to
decay or hadrons with kinetic energy greater than the nuclear
potential. After this condition is satisﬁed, the remaining ex-
citation energy is evenly distributed between the nucleons in
a process known as thermalization. The main characteristics
of the nucleus does not change at this stage, so that its atomic
number, mass number, and excitation energy remain the same
ones until the end of the process [17, 35].

Another fundamental characteristic of CRISP is the strict
veriﬁcation of the Pauli exclusion principle [17], possible
thanks, both to the application of the Fermi gas model and
the multicollisional approach which to be known enables the
4-vectors of all nucleons at each step of intranuclear cascade.

Implementation of the muon neutrino channel as an event

generator of the intranuclear cascade

1. Primary interaction

The energy range of the muonic neutrino in this paper is 0, 2
- 1, 5 GeV. The most important channels in this energy range
are the quasi-elastic scattering and the resonance production.
The formation of the ∆ (1232) dominates the resonance pro-
duction, which subsequently decays into a pion and a nucleon.
The ﬁrst step to study the nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus
interaction is to incorporate the primary neutrino-nucleon in-
teraction in the CRISP model. In this way we are consider-
ing the neutrino-nucleus interaction as an incoherent sum of
the contributions from all nucleons inside the nucleus. Be-
sides, CRISP calculates many nuclear effects as those due to

3

the Fermi motion and to the antisymmetrization of the nuclear
wave-functions, as described in subsection II A, as well as all
the possible particle-hole states formed due to ﬁnal state inter-
actions (labeled as npnh events). In the present work, we will
not be considered a possible coherent contributions.

Here, the primary neutrino-nucleon interaction is formu-
lated through a toy model where are exactly considered kine-
matic and isospin aspects of the interaction.

Due to the limitations of the CRISP model, where the nu-
clear states are described as a Fermi gas, the angular momen-
tum is not a conserved quantity. For these reasons, all our
calculations are averaged on the spin states, and an important
consequence is the fact that we will not be able to describe an-
gular distributions correctly. In the following, the model for
the primary interaction is referred as Kinematic Model (KM).
In our model, the neutrino is supposed to interact with a
single nucleon, and since our goal is to analyze the interaction
near the threshold region, we consider two interaction chan-
nels, namely, the quasi-elastic and the ∆−resonance forma-
tion, described below.

2. Quasi-elastic channel

The CCqe channel corresponds to a quasi-elastic interac-
tion between neutrino and nucleon where the charged current
induces isospin modiﬁcation of the nucleon. In the process,
the neutrino is absorbed and a muon is produced. This pro-
cess is indicated in Table I.

The empirical formula that gives the CCqe cross section per

nucleon is

We implemented in the code the Equation (6), being the best
ﬁt polynomial of order 4th for experimental deuteron experi-
mental data in the range of interest. The coefﬁcients An are
shown in Table I.

3. Resonant channel

In the initial state, we have a nucleon N with momentum
pN a nd a neutrino ν with momentum pν. This state is repre-
sented by |N, νis,τ , where s, τ are the total spin and isospin of
the system neutrino-nucleon. Let be gs

stant for the neutrino-nucleon vertex, and s′, τ ′ the spin and

rough and obeys to simplicity in the present KM. A consistent
formalism of the ∆-nucleon interaction from the effective La-

the neutrino that are different from the states formed by the
neutrino-nucleon primary interaction, and if they are detected
could be confused with another event. This effect is a conse-
quence of the ﬁnal state interaction in the nucleus. Moreover,
could to come, for instance, from the nucleon-nucleon interac-
tion where is exchanged the energy of protons and neutrons in
the binary collisions of the intranuclear cascade or, in the case
where the expected nucleon in the ﬁnal state remains bound
to the nucleus. The output result is that the original state pro-
duced is counted in the primary interaction as a different state.
We will refer to this effect as crossed channels or fake events,
as they are usually called in the literature.

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

A. Free parameters adjustment

neutrino-deuterium cross section on deuterium measured at
Brokkhaven National Laboratory (BNL) [36] and Argone Na-
tional Laboratory (ANL)[37] were used. This information
is the same experimental data employed previously by O.
Lalakulich and U. Mosel in their studies on pion produc-
tion in the MiniBooNE experiment [16]. Here, we disregard
the small nuclear effects present in the interaction with deu-
terium and consider the cross section as representative of the

ﬁtted result for our model to the available experimental data.
In Table I the corresponding values for all the parameters are
displayed. One observes a nice ﬁt of our calculation to the
experimental data. In the case of the channel in Figure 1(b)
(channel B of Table I) one can notice that the calculation
slightly underestimates data above Eν ∼ 1.5 GeV. This re-
sult can be attributed to the lack of resonances heavier than
∆(1232) in the present version of our model.

With the inclusion of the KM described in the last section
into the CRISP model, we can evaluate the nuclear effects
on the neutrino-nucleus interaction and calculate the inclusive
neutrino-nucleus cross section up to Eν ∼ 1.5 GeV.

B. Reaction cross section

The neutrino-nucleus cross sections are determined em-
ploying the CRISP code by calculating the frequency of ap-
pearance of a previously obtained channel from a number N0
of total events. So then, the cross section reads

σev = σg

Nev
N0

,

(16)

where Nev is the number of events that ended within the con-
crete channel under analysis, and σg = πr2
0A2/3, is the nu-
cleus geometric cross section, with A being the mass number
and r0 = 1.2 fm.

We consider as an event, to anything of the ﬁnal conﬁgura-
tion listed in Table I. The calculations are performed for the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two kinds of events, namely true-type and like-type events. A
true-type event is when the ﬁnal conﬁguration is exactly as
those listed above, while a like-type event is when the conﬁg-
uration exists amid other particles.

The total cross sections for each channel are shown in Fig-

ure 2 for all nuclei studied in the present work.

In Figure 3 the calculated CCqe cross section are compared
with the available experimental data on 12C. We observe an
overall agreement between calculation and experimental data
in the like-type events, while on the true-type events the theo-
retical calculations underestimate the data. The diminishing in
the nuclear cross section in the last case is mainly attributable
to events where the proton in the ﬁnal state remains bond in
the nucleus.

In the CRISP model, the nucleus is described as a Fermi gas
in a square-well potential, which is a fair description for heav-
ier nuclei, but is not adequate for 12C. Unfortunately, there are
not any experimental data for other nuclei or channels, but one
can expect that this nuclear structure effect is less important
for heavier nuclei.

One can notice in Figure 2 that there is an overall decreas-
ing in the cross sections when the nuclear mass increases.
Although the nuclear level structure here considered, corre-
sponding to a square-well potential, it has some noticeable
effects on the relative cross sections. To better visualizes this
effect, in Figure 4 we present the calculated cross section (σX )
normalized to the 12C cross section (σ12C ) for six different nu-
clei: X = {16O,27 Al,40 Ar,56 Fe,208 Pb}, for both true-type
and like-type events. Two general aspects are observed: (i)
there is a fast increase in R = σX /σ12C for all nuclei at low
neutrino energy and, (ii) there is an explicit dependence on the
nuclear mass.

The diminishing in the cross section is due to nuclear ef-
fects, since it depends on the nuclear mass.
In fact, as the
nucleon produced in the ﬁnal state after the neutrino-nucleon
interaction propagates inside the nuclear matter, it can trans-
fer its energy to other nucleons, so in many cases, the particles
emitted from the nucleus are not exactly those formed in the
neutrino-nucleon interaction.

Since the average length of the distance traveled by a nu-
cleon increases with the nuclear mass, also the probability of
crossed channels increases. This effect reduces, therefore, the
observed cross section, as can be noticed in Figure 4.

The rise in the ratio of low energies, R, is related to the
escape of the nucleon produced in the primary interaction of
the nucleus. At low energy, most of the neutrino energy goes
to the muon production, leaving the nucleon with low energy,
so it can not overcome the nuclear barrier. The result is that
one has a crossed channel event. Over of the region of fast
increase of R, appears a plateau that it remains approximately
constant for all nuclei and channels. In this region, the pro-
duced nucleon has enough energy to escape from the nucleus.
However, in its way out the nucleon will interact with oth-
ers nucleons and eventually, a charge-exchange collision will
produce a crossed channel. Then, as larger is the nucleus as
higher is the probability of crossed channel events, and for the
CCqe case, we have checked that this probability is roughly
proportional to A1/3.

6

The same reasoning applies qualitatively to the resonant
channel. However, in these cases, the reaction mechanism
is more complicated because the resonance propagates inside
the nucleus exchanging energy with other nucleons, which
will produce other effects that superpose to the ones described
above. For example in Ref. [38], the authors have presented
detailed calculations performed in 12C showing that the two-
particle two-hole is the mainly contribution of multinucleon
excitations. Many of these effects are related by the inﬂuence
of short range correlations (SRCs) on the one-nucleon (1N)
and two-nucleon (2N) knockout channels, and to two-body
currents arising from meson-exchange currents. For the chan-
nel of the like-type, the results for R are very similar to the
true-type.

Another real nuclear effect on the neutrino-nucleus interac-
tion can be observed in the calculated cross sections for nu-
clei, as shown in Figure 3 , as compared to the interaction on
nucleon, as shown in Figure 2. In fact, one can observe that
the interaction threshold is around 0.45 GeV in the nucleon
case, while the threshold is below that energy for nuclear in-
teractions. This subthreshold interaction is due to the Fermi
motion of bound nucleons, and it is a natural consequence of
our calculations using the CRISP model. In fact, these kinds
of phenomena can also be observed for other processes [21].
Goldhaber and Shrock [22] relating by ﬁrst time the possible
subthreshold reactions involving nuclear ﬁssion such as: (i)
photo-ﬁssion with pion-production and, (ii) charged-current
neutrino-nucleus reactions that lead to ﬁssion and/or to the
formation of a Coulomb bound state of a µ− with the nucleus
of a ﬁssion fragment, that is a very similar to the reactions
studied in this work.

In Figure 4 we analyze the like-type events as compared
to the true-type ones. The like-type cross sections are always
higher since these counts the true-type events and also more
complex conﬁgurations. With the CRISP model, it is possible
to disentangle the various contribution to the like-type cross
section, as shown in the Figure 5 for some of the more simple
conﬁgurations. In such ﬁgure, we showed the partial contri-
butions from some ﬁnal state conﬁguration to the like-type
cross section for 56Fe and 12C in the CCqe channel and the
CCres channel like-type. The addition of like-type, 1p+1n,
2p+1n, 1p+2n, 2p+2n in (dashed lines), and the true-type in
(solid line) are also shown for comparison. In both nuclei in
consideration, the sequence of contributions is similar: main
contribution from 1p+1n, in second place 2p+1n plus 1p+2n,
and ﬁnally the 2p+2n, more closed to the true-type in the last
reactions. For the CCqe reactions the true-type and like-type
are broadening in ∼ 0.3 GeV, whereas for CCres this ”thresh-
old” is in ∼ 0.4 GeV due the nuclear delta liberty grade.

As one allows more and more complex conﬁgurations, the
cross section rises from the true-type cross section to the like-
type cross section, where are considered all possible conﬁg-
urations.
It is also possible to observe that increasing the
neutrino energy, the complexity of like-type events increases,
while at low energy true-type and like-type almost coincides.
Comparing the CCqe and the resonant channels, we note that
the several trends and relative contribution of a different chan-
nel are similar.

(ﬁlled squares) [9] , and like-type (hole squares) [11] are shown for
comparison.

In general, one can see that real nuclear effects are of great
importance to understand the neutrino-nucleus interaction.
These results are relevant since some cross section (208Pb for
instance) can be reduced to about 20% of the 12C one due to
these effects.

The interaction with the nucleus of the particles produced

in the primary interaction is responsible for the more intense
effects, reducing the cross section per nucleon as the nuclear
mass increases. At low energy, however, the binding energy is
more important, and probably nuclear structure will be neces-
sary to completely understand the process for neutrino energy
up to ∼ 0.5 GeV. In this direction, a recent work within the
Continuum Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) has calcu-
lated the (νµ/¯νµ)−12C cross section in kinematics conditions
for MiniBooNE and T2K. The cross sections have shown to
be comparable with the experimental data, but underestimat-
ing the MiniBooNE data for backward muon scattering an-
gles, where the missing strength can be associated with the
contribution from multinucleon knockout and single-pion pro-
duction processes. Among other microscopical models that
can be useful in this region is the Relativistic Quasiparticle
RPA [39], that studied the evolution of the conﬁguration space
number below 0.3 GeV. In this energy interval, the cross sec-
tions converge for sufﬁciently large conﬁguration space and
ﬁnal-state spin and could be joined smoothly with the Rel-
ativistic Fermi Gas including at least 1N and 2N knockout
reaction in the same way as in Ref. [38].

also, the fraction of crossed channels events is

Rc(i) =

Nc(i)
Np(i)

.

(18)

In Figure 6 are shown the percentage of false events, Rc(i)
according to Eq. (18), as a function of neutrino energy for
CCqe channels for the studied target nuclei: 12C, 16O, 27Al,
40Ar, 56Fe and 208Pb. We note that the ratio is initializing
in 250 MeV with the higher value (≈ 80%) and then it goes
to an averaged constant value. The behavior is similar to all
the target nuclei except for 12C, mainly due that the Fermi
gas model is not a good description for light nuclei as carbon.
We can intuit that the saturation effect of Rc(i) is because
the neutrino has reached the maximum of interactions within
the space of possible conﬁgurations of type xp − xn created
inside the nucleus over 0.5 GeV. This fact must be revised
when we will include in our simulation more channels coming
from resonances higher than ∆(1232).

In Table II we present the results of fake events obtained
with CRISP using KM and CIM formalism for the CCqe and
CCres channels in 12C, 16O, 27Al, 40Ar, 56Fe and 208Pb. The
CIM model cross sections as a function of the neutrino en-
ergy
[5] were ﬁtted to a fourth degree polynomial to in-
clude in CRISP. In the ﬁrst column of Table II, we shown the

D. Energy distribution of the emitted pions and muons

The pion spectrum in the CRISP model is calculated as

dσ
dTπ

= σg

Nev(Tπ)
N0∆Tπ

,

The employment of different formalisms like KM and CIM
for the neutrino cross section of primary interaction has almost
any effect on the percentage of false events because they are
a direct consequence of the intranuclear cascade and not of
primary exchanges.

awhere Nev(Tπ) is the number of events for a speciﬁc chan-
nel producing a pion with a given isospin with energy between
Tπ and Tπ +∆Eπ. The MiniBooNE experiment measured the
positive pion spectrum for Eν ∼ 1 GeV on 12C [10, 11]. In
the left panel of Figure 7, we show our calculation averaged
over the published MiniBooNE ﬂux for π+ [12] in compari-
son with the experimental data. We observe that both calcu-
lation and data show a similar shape with the peak around 80
MeV and a large tail at high energies. Quantitatively there is a
good agreement between calculation and experiment, notably
in the peak region. At energies above 250 MeV, the calcu-

lation underestimates the experimental data. It is likely that
this effect is related to that we were not included higher mass
resonances in the present calculations.

Similarly, the ejected muon distribution is calculated as a

function of the kinetic muon energy as

dσ
dTµ

= σg

Nev(Tµ)

.

The right panel of Figure 7 shows the muon distribution cal-
culation as a function of the kinetic muon energy, averaged
over the published MiniBonNE ﬂux for π+ [12], in com-
parison with the experimental MiniBooNE data for Eν ∼ 1
GeV. Here, we note that our theoretical calculation is slightly
lower than the experimental results, but the behavior and the
peak position are in a well agreement with data. Relative to
these calculations: (i) we do not adjust the pion mass reso-
nances to reproduce the experimental spectra as it was done
by Lalakulich and Mosel et al. in [16]; (ii) we are taken into
account only the contribution of the delta resonance, for this
reason, we do not implement other reaction channels in the
neutrino generator with other resonances, presented in the in-
tranuclear cascade in these calculations and; (iii) our formal-
ism is not including an angular distribution for the ejected
particle. Then, our model will not be in completely agree-
ment with some experimental data, in comparison with an-
other model performed by such issue. Also, it is important
to remember that we use a Fermi gas model, which is not the
best choice, especially for 12C, so that structure does not have
any physical signiﬁcance.

Some ﬁnal words are devoted to the comparison with an-
other theoretical model, as such that performed in Ref. [16].
The analysis performed here is in many aspects similar to the
one presented in Ref. [16], where medium’s effects on neu-
trino nucleus interaction were studied. The most relevant dif-
ferences between the approach used here and that in Ref. [16]
are related to the modeling of the bound nucleon dynamics. A

summary of these differences is the following:

1. In the CRISP model the nucleus is described as a global
Fermi gas, while in Ref. [16] is used a local Thomas-
Fermi approach.

2. As a consequence of the ﬁrst difference, in CRISP
model the Pauli blocking mechanism is accounted for
strictly, while in Ref. [16] it is considered statistically.
Careful analysis of the advantages of a strict Pauli
blocking mechanism are presented in Refs. [17, 35].

3. With the inclusion of Fermi motion and rigorous Pauli
blocking, some nuclear effects emerge naturally in the
calculations with the CRISP model, such as shadow-
ing effect, that is present in photoabsorption and in me-
son production, for example in Refs. [26, 40]. Also,
medium’s effects on resonance propagation are natu-
rally accounted in the CRISP model.

These differences are relatively more important for energies
near the reaction threshold, and should practically disappear
as the incoming particle energy increases. At ﬁrst sight, the
aspects mentioned above could explain why the CRISP model
gives better results as compared to experimental data than the
calculations in Ref. [16], however the disagreement between
the both calculations seems to be too large to be attributed
only to those different methods used in each model.

The medium’s modiﬁcations in ∆ resonance, for instance,
were ﬁrst observed in photoabsorption measurements and
were mainly attributed to Fermi motion and Pauli blocking
effects [41–43], although some effects from the coherent sum
of resonant and direct channels could be observed [44]. In
Ref. [16] the authors inform to have included the ∆ resonance
broadening through the Salcedo and Oset model [45], but in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their spectral function are also encompassed for the bound nu-
cleon, both Fermi motion and Pauli blocking effects. It is pos-
sible, then, that the ∆ resonance broadening is taken into ac-
count twice: one time in the modeling of the resonance, and
the another time by the nuclear effects already considered in
their nuclear model. This way of counting could explain why
their calculation underestimates the cross section in the res-
onance peak energy, since the broadening of the resonance
width results in a reduction of the cross section at the peak.
Also, it can explain the shift of the peak energy to lower ener-
gies, since the combination of Fermi motion and Pauli block-
ing produces such effect.

IV. CONCLUSION

In the present work we report an extensive analysis of nu-
clear effects in neutrino-nucleus interaction. For this purpose,
a simple model of neutrino-nucleon, which was called Kinetic
Model, is used together with the CRISP model to take into ac-
count the nuclear effects. This simple model has three free
parameters for all channels analyzed in this study. We deter-
mined these parameters by ﬁttings to the speciﬁc channels to
neutrino-deuterium experimental data.

The calculations were performed for neutrino energies from
0.2 to 1.5 GeV for 12C, 16O, 27Al, 40Ar, 56Fe and 208Pb. We
calculated the cross section for all nuclei in the whole energy
range using CCqe and CCres channels. Where data is avail-
able, a comparison between calculation and experiment was
provided. The pion and muon spectra are also calculated and
compared to the experimental data showing a fair agreement.
For the set of target nuclei employed, we performed an ex-
ploratory study of the fake events generated in several reac-
tions. This study has shown that the percentage of CCqe fake
events for 12C, important for MiniBooNE, are in the same or-
der of ≈ 30 % of previous works [14, 16]. Whereas than for

12

other nuclei the percentage of fake events increases as well the
nuclei masses increases due to the structure effect and mult-
inucleon excitations in the nucleus. Using two different for-
malisms of neutrino-nucleon cross sections was shown than
the percentage of fake events are almost independent of the
primary interactions because they are a direct consequence of
intranuclear cascade. In a future work, we will improve the
simple Kinetical Model used for the primary interaction using
the Consistent Isobar Model-CIM [5, 6].

Our conclusions are that nuclear effects are decisive for
understanding the neutrino-nucleus interaction, and the most
substantial effect is the interaction of the produced parti-
cles with the nucleus. Another important effect that appears
mainly for neutrino energies below ∼ 0.5 GeV are the nu-
clear binding energy, Fermi motion and Pauli blocking. For
all studied channels, we observed the subthreshold reaction.
Finally, we predict that nuclear structure plays a relevant role
in this energy range.
