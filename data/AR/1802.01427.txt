Abstract

We report the measurement of the longitudinal diﬀusion constant in liquid argon with the DarkSide-50 dual-

phase time projection chamber. The measurement is performed at drift electric ﬁelds of 100 V/cm, 150 V/cm,

and 200 V/cm using high statistics 39Ar decays from atmospheric argon. We derive an expression to describe

the pulse shape of the electroluminescence signal (S2) in dual-phase TPCs. The derived S2 pulse shape is

ﬁt to events from the uppermost portion of the TPC in order to characterize the radial dependence of the

signal. The results are provided as inputs to the measurement of the longitudinal diﬀusion constant DL,

which we ﬁnd to be (4.12 ± 0.09) cm2/s for a selection of 140 keV electron recoil events in 200 V/cm drift

ﬁeld and 2.8 kV/cm extraction ﬁeld. To study the systematics of our measurement we examine datasets of

varying event energy, ﬁeld strength, and detector volume yielding a weighted average value for the diﬀusion

constant of (4.09 ± 0.12) cm2/s. The measured longitudinal diﬀusion constant is observed to have an energy

dependence, and within the studied energy range the result is systematically lower than other results in the

literature.

Keywords: Electron diﬀusion constant Liquid argon Time projection chamber

1. Introduction

DarkSide-50 is the current phase of the DarkSide dark matter search program, operating underground at

the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The detector is a dual-phase (liquid-gas) argon Time Pro-

jection Chamber (TPC), designed for the direct detection of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs),

and housed within a veto system of liquid scintillator and water Cherenkov detectors. DarkSide-50 has

2

produced WIMP search results using both atmospheric argon (AAr) [1] and underground argon (UAr) [2],

which is substantially reduced in 39Ar activity.

The TPC is ﬁlled with liquid argon (LAr) with a thin layer of gaseous argon (GAr) at the top. Ionizing

radiation in the active volume of the LAr TPC deposits energy in the form of excitation and ionization.

This process leads to the formation of excited dimers Ar∗

2 whose de-excitation produces prompt scintillation

light called S1. The liquid volume is subjected to a uniform drift electric ﬁeld, causing ionization electrons

that escape recombination to drift to the surface of the LAr. The drifted electrons are extracted into and

drifted across the GAr by a stronger extraction ﬁeld, producing electroluminescence light called S2. The S2

signal provides 3D position information: longitudinal position is given by the drift time of the electrons and

transverse position is given by the light distribution over the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Pulse shape

discrimination on S1 and the ratio S2/S1 allows discrimination between nuclear recoils and electron recoils

in the LAr.

The active volume of the LAr TPC is deﬁned by a 35.6 cm diameter by 35.6 cm height cylinder. The wall

is a monolithic piece of PTFE, the bottom surface is deﬁned by a fused silica window, and the top is deﬁned

by a stainless steel grid, as shown in Fig. 1. To be precise, the grid is positioned just below the liquid-gas

interface. All inner PTFE and fused silica surfaces are coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) to shift the

128 nm scintillation light of LAr to 420 nm visible light. The S1 and S2 signals are detected by two arrays

of 19 PMTs at the top and bottom of the TPC with waveform readout at 250 MHz sampling rate. The

data acquisition is triggered on S1 and records waveforms for 20 µs before the trigger and several hundred

microseconds after the trigger, long enough to capture the maximum electron drift time in the TPC, which

is drift ﬁeld-dependent. More information on the DarkSide-50 detector and its performance can be found in

references [3–8].

In this work, we analyze the time spectrum of the S2 pulse to investigate the longitudinal diﬀusion of

ionization electrons as a function of drift time in the LAr. The majority of the data used in this analysis were

taken as part of the dark matter search campaign using AAr [1], which is dominated by 1 Bq/kg of 39Ar

activity [9, 10]. The dark matter search data were taken with 200 V/cm drift electric ﬁeld and 2.8 kV/cm

extraction electric ﬁeld, corresponding to a 4.2 kV/cm electroluminescence ﬁeld in the gas region. The drift

speed of electrons in the LAr for this ﬁeld conﬁguration is (0.93 ± 0.01) mm/µs [1], with a maximum drift

time of 376 µs. Data taken with 150 V/cm and 100 V/cm drift ﬁelds and 2.3 kV/cm extraction ﬁeld are used

to study the systematic uncertainties of the longitudinal diﬀusion measurement.

As a cloud of ionization electrons drifts through the liquid the random walk of the thermalized, or

nearly thermalized, electrons will cause the cloud to diﬀuse over time. The diﬀusion in the longitudinal

and transverse directions, relative to the drift direction, need not be the same.

In DarkSide-50, we are

sensitive to the longitudinal diﬀusion, which manifests as a smearing of the S2 pulse shape in time. Previous

measurements of electron diﬀusion in liquid argon have been performed in single phase TPCs [11, 12] where

the charge is read out directly. This work represents the ﬁrst measurement of electron diﬀusion using a

grid is 35.6 cm at room temperature. The LAr surface is slightly above the grid.

We assume that the initial size σ(cid:48)

0 of a cloud of ionization electrons is of the same order as the recoiled
electron track (about 30 µm root mean square (RMS) based on a G4DS simulation [6] of 140 keV electron

recoils in LAr), which is small compared to the eventual size due to diﬀusion. Then, if the electrons follow

a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation, σ(cid:48)

0, centered at a point (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) at time t = 0,

their distribution after drifting a time td is given by [13]

n(ρ, z, td) =

where n0 is the number of initial ionization electrons, vd is the drift velocity in the liquid, DT is the
transverse diﬀusion coeﬃcient, DL is the longitudinal diﬀusion coeﬃcient, ρ2 = x2 + y2, and z is deﬁned

parallel to the drift direction.

In DarkSide-50, the electron drift lifetime is >5 ms [1], corresponding to

exceptionally low impurity levels. We therefore neglect the loss of free electrons to negative impurities, so

that the integral of n(ρ, z, td) over space returns the constant n0 for every td.

From Eqn. 1, we see that the longitudinal proﬁle of the electron cloud is a Gaussian wave which broadens

over time:

σ2
L = 2DLtd + σ(cid:48)2
0

(2)

where σL is the width of the wave. When the width of the wave grows slowly compared to the drift velocity

in the liquid, the diﬀusion of the electron cloud manifests as a simple Gaussian smearing of the S2 pulse

shape. The goal of this analysis is to measure DL, which we achieve by evaluating the smearing σL as a

function of drift time td for many events. The smearing is extracted by ﬁtting the S2 pulse shape and the

drift time comes directly from the reconstruction. In Sec. 2 we derive an analytic form of the S2 pulse shape.

In Sec. 3 we apply the ﬁtting procedure to various data sets to perform the measurement of electron diﬀusion

in liquid argon.

2. S2 pulse shape measurement

The analytic expression for the S2 pulse shape is derived from the following model for the production of

light in the gas pocket of the TPC. We assume that ionization electrons drift with constant velocity across

the gas pocket, producing Ar excimers uniformly along their drift path. The excimers de-excite and produce

light according to a two-component exponential [14], similar to the light production in the liquid.

If all

electrons are extracted from the liquid at precisely the same time, then these two eﬀects deﬁne the S2 pulse

shape. In reality, electrons of a given ionization cloud are extracted from the liquid with a distribution of

times, which we model by introducing a Gaussian smearing term σ, related to the longitudinal σL in Eqn. 2,

as described in Sec. 2.2.

2.1. Basic shape

What we will refer to as the basic, or idealized, form of the S2 pulse shape assumes that all electrons are

extracted out of the liquid at the same time. It is described by a time proﬁle y(t) given by the convolution

5

of a uniform distribution with a two-component exponential:

yideal(t; τ1, τ2, p, T ) = p · y(cid:48)

ideal(t; τ1, T ) + (1 − p) · y(cid:48)

ideal(t; τ2, T )

where

(3)

(4)

Here, τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow component lifetimes respectively, p is the fast component fraction, and

T is the drift time of the electrons across the gas pocket. We assume that all electrons are extracted out of

the liquid at t = 0. The two decay constants are expected to diﬀer from those of the liquid, the fast and slow

components in gas being 11 ns and 3.2 µs respectively [14]. An example pulse shape is shown in Fig. 2a in

black. Notice that T governs the time to the peak of the pulse. The “kinks” in the rising and falling edges

are due to the drastically diﬀerent decay times τ1 and τ2, their vertical positions are set by p, while their

horizontal positions are set by the total drift time in the gas.

2.2. Gaussian smearing

There are many reasons that electrons may not be extracted out of the liquid simultaneously. The

primary reason considered in this analysis is that the cloud of electrons is diﬀuse, with diﬀusion arising

from drift through the liquid. Minor reasons include the initial size of the cloud of ionization electrons and

ﬂuctuations in the time for individual electrons to pass through the grid and the surface of the liquid. To

model the diﬀusion, we incorporate a smearing term into the S2 pulse shape by convolving Eqn. 3 with a

Gaussian centered at 0 with width σ:

y(t; τ1, τ2, p, T, σ) = yideal ∗ gaus(0, σ) = p · y(cid:48)(t; τ1, T, σ) + (1 − p) · y(cid:48)(t; τ2, T, σ)

where

vd is the drift velocity of electrons in LAr and σ0 is a drift-time-independent constant accounting for all the

minor smearing eﬀects (initial ionization electron cloud size, additional smearing of the S2 pulse shape in

the electroluminescence region, and smearing during electron extraction from the liquid surface). This form

has a simple intuitive interpretation: It is the ideal shape of Eqn. 3 with the sharp features smoothed out,

as shown in Fig. 2a in gray.

6

To describe an arbitrary S2 pulse we include three additional parameters in the ﬁt function: a time oﬀset

t0, a vertical oﬀset y0, and an overall scale factor A. The ﬁnal ﬁt function is of the form:

yﬁt(t; τ1, τ2, p, T, σ, A, t0, y0) = y0 + A · y(t − t0; τ1, τ2, p, T, σ)

(9)

where σ is the quantity of interest.

2.3. Fitting S2 pulse shape

We perform event-by-event maximum likelihood ﬁts to the S2 signals. The ﬁts are performed on the

summed waveform of all 38 PMT channels of the TPC. Before building the sum waveform, the individ-

ual channels are ﬁrst baseline-subtracted to remove the DC oﬀset in the digitizers, scaled by the single

photoelectron (PE) mean, and inverted. The sum waveform is down-sampled, combining every 8 samples

together to give 32 ns sampling. Single PEs have a FWHM of ∼10 ns, so down-sampling is performed to

reduce bin-to-bin correlations and allow the down-sampled waveform to be interpreted as a histogram of

PE arrival times. In the absence of down-sampling, the 250 MHz waveform resolution is higher than the

single PE width, and the histogram bins are highly correlated. With the down-sampling, though the bins

are not integer valued, the bin-to-bin correlations are suﬃciently reduced that they approximately follow

Poisson statistics. Our interpretation of waveforms as histograms has been validated by checking that the

bin contents at the same time index of the down-sampled waveforms of events with the same S2 pulse height

follow Poisson distributions.

2.4. Goodness-of-ﬁt

To evaluate goodness-of-ﬁt of the S2 pulse shape on the waveforms, we evaluate a χ2 statistic. However,

many of the bins have low (fewer than 5) counts, even after 8 sample re-binning, invalidating a direct χ2

evaluation. To resolve this issue, we re-bin the waveform again, this time using unequal bin widths. We

choose the bin edges so that, for the S2 pulse with moderate smearing (σ = 0.3 us) shown in Fig. 2a, each

bin has equal counts (Fig. 2b).

The binning is conﬁgured so that the minimum bin width is 32 ns, and the bin edges are truncated to land

on 4 ns intervals. For simplicity, we use the same re-binning to evaluate the χ2 of all events. As the pulse

shape varies, the re-binned waveforms will not populate the bins with equal counts, as shown in Fig. 2b.

However, their shapes will be similar enough and, as we constrained our study to S2 >104 PE, the bins do

not fall below 5 counts. Example waveforms before and after re-binning are shown in Fig. 2c and 2d.

The χ2 statistic that we use is the one prescribed by Baker and Cousins [15], reproduced here:

(For interpretation of the
references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

2.5. Degeneracy of parameters

The form of the S2 pulse shape given in Eqn. 9 has an approximate degeneracy: the same shape can be

produced using diﬀerent combinations of T , t0, and σ. The degeneracy can be seen visually in Fig. 3, where

ﬁve nearly identical pulse shapes are shown using diﬀerent parameter values.

This degeneracy can result in incorrect parameter estimation if the parameters are all left free in the

ﬁt.

In order to make a precise estimation of the S2 diﬀusion parameter σ, we ﬁx the gas pocket drift

time T . T is related to gas pocked thickness and electroluminescence ﬁeld strength, which both exhibit

rotational symmetry. T is approximately azimuthally symmetric, and it is suﬃcient to ﬁx T based on its

radial dependence, ﬁtting events with very little diﬀusion to extract T (r). The relationship between T and

r is consistent with a non-uniform electroluminescence ﬁeld that is strongest at the center of the TPC and

gradually weakens towards the edge. There are several possible explanations, including a sagging anode

window or a deﬂecting grid, but we have insuﬃcient information from these results to discriminate between

these explanations.

2.5.1. Zero diﬀusion event selection

We search for zero-diﬀusion events in a subset of the high statistics 39Ar data from the AAr dark matter

search dataset. The data used here are at higher energies than those used in the dark matter search analysis,

S2 = (1 − 5) × 104 PE, because we require high PE statistics to ensure the quality of the S2 pulse shape

ﬁts to individual events. To examine zero diﬀusion events we select single scatter events from the top of

the TPC passing our basic quality cuts requiring that all channels are present in the readout, and that the

waveform baselines were found successfully. More precisely, we look for events with S1, S2, and td less than
5 µs. We ﬁt Eqn. 9 to each event, using the maximum likelihood method described in Sec. 2.3.

The 3-parameter degeneracy described in Sec. 2.5 is not relevant in zero-diﬀusion events, however, it is

broken nonetheless by ﬁxing σ to a very small non-zero value to avoid division issues. The slow component

term τ2 can be “pre-ﬁt” using the tail of each waveform, where the fast component contribution to the

electroluminescence signal is negligible. This is done prior to re-binning, when the ﬁt has more sensitivity
to τ2. We ﬁt a simple exponential decay in the range of 9 µs to 20 µs of each event, to avoid smearing from

the fast decay component and baseline noise, see Fig. 2c for reference. This range guarantees that we ﬁt to

the tail of the S2 pulse even in events with the highest diﬀusion, where the peak is farthest from the pulse

start. In the full ﬁt we initialize τ2 to the value from the pre-ﬁt, but leave it free to vary. This improved

ﬁtter performance but does not aﬀect the overall results compared to using a global ﬁxed value of τ2. The

amplitude A is initialized to the total area of the waveform. We have now turned an 8 parameter ﬁt into

eﬀectively a 5 parameter ﬁt. The remaining parameters are given sensible initial values, as shown in Tab. 1.

Reasonable variation of these initial values did not change the outcome of the ﬁts and ﬁt results remained

within deﬁned parameter limits.

2.5.2. Results

We ﬁt the S2 pulse shape to 3.47 × 104 zero-diﬀusion events. The goodness-of-ﬁt is evaluated for each

event using the procedure described in Sec. 2.4. Because we use the same binning and ﬁt function for each ﬁt,

the NDF is the same throughout (NDF = 133). The distribution of the reduced χ2 statistic (χ2

red = χ2/NDF)
red > 1.5. The
zero diﬀusion events exhibit a spectrum of separations between S1 and S2 and there are some events where

red < 6. About 10 % of events have very poor ﬁts with χ2

is shown in Fig. 4, zoomed to χ2

the signals are so close to each other that they are essentially indistinguishable. To avoid these suboptimal
events we require t0 > −0.1 µs and χ2

red < 1.5. After these additional cuts are applied, we plot T from each

ﬁt as a function of radial position, as shown in Fig. 5a.

The mean of the T vs. r2 distribution is well ﬁt by a linear function. We take the function T (r) to be of

the form:

Fitting Eqn. 11 to the mean of the T vs.

r2 distribution, we ﬁnd AT = (910.8 ± 0.8) ns and BT =

(376 ± 1) cm2. Uncertainties are statistical.

Figure 4: Reduced χ2 of S2 pulse shape ﬁts to 1.6 × 104 zero-diﬀusion events.

The ﬁts to the zero-diﬀusion events can also give us information about the fast component fraction p in

the gas and the slow component lifetime τ2. The distribution of p vs. radial position is shown in Fig. 5b. We

expect p to depend on the extraction ﬁeld, as the ﬁeld strength will aﬀect recombination and therefore the

ratio of triplet to singlet states [16, 17]. Since the electroluminescence ﬁeld varies radially in DarkSide-50,

so does p.

The relationship between p and r is well ﬁt by a function of the form

p(r) = Ap(1 +

(12)

Fitting Eqn. 12 to the mean of the p vs. r2 distribution we ﬁnd Ap = (7.47 ± 0.02) × 10−2 and Bp =
(488 ± 6) cm2. Uncertainties are statistical.

Because of the 32 ns binning of the waveforms, we do not have the resolution required to estimate the

fast component lifetime τ1, instead it is ﬁxed to a reasonable, small number in the ﬁts. The distribution
of τ2 is shown in Fig. 6. The average slow component lifetime is τ2 = 3.43 µs, which agrees well with the
previously measured value τ2 = (3.2 ± 0.3) µs [18].

3. Electron diﬀusion measurement

3.1. Event selection

The principle data used for this analysis are the abundant 39Ar decays from AAr data at standard

200 V/cm drift ﬁeld and 2.8 kV/cm extraction ﬁeld, the same data set used in Sec. 2.5. We use additional

sets of data to perform cross-checks and systematic uncertainty measurements of the diﬀusion, including

data at diﬀerent drift and extraction ﬁelds.

To perform the measurement of the longitudinal diﬀusion constant, we use well-reconstructed single

scatter 39Ar events. We select events that pass basic quality cuts as discussed in Sec. 2.5.1. We select single

scatter events by requiring that the reconstruction software identiﬁes one S1 and one S2 pulse, and that the

S1 start time is at the expected trigger time within the acquisition window. To reduce possible systematics

due to variations of T (r) at diﬀerent r, we select events in a narrow r slice: 9 cm to 12 cm. Finally, we select

events with maximum possible PE statistics before the S2 saturates the digitizers: (4 − 5) × 104 PE. The

selected events have a mean S1 of 1000 PE with RMS 150 PE. The measured S1 light yield in DarkSide-50 is

(7.0 ± 0.3) PE/keV [1], corresponding to a selection of (140 ± 20) keV electron recoils. We repeat the analysis

on diﬀerent r and S2 slices to estimate the systematics.

3.2. Fitting procedure

We perform a ﬁt of the S2 pulse shape on every event that passes the event selection. As in the case of

the S2 pulse shape analysis, there are 8 parameters in the ﬁt (Eqn. 9). Here we describe the choice of initial

values for each of those parameters.

• As shown in Fig. 5, T varies with transverse position. We ﬁx T on an event-by-event basis, evaluating

T (r) as given by Eqn. 11.

• For each event we pre-determine the value of the baseline oﬀset y0 by ﬁtting a ﬂat line to the pre-signal

region of −5 µs to −1 µs. The baseline value in the full ﬁt is ﬁxed to the value determined here.

• The fast component lifetime should be independent of td. However, τ1 cannot be well-constrained due

to the resolution of our waveforms. Because the fast component gets washed out with any non-negligible

amount of smearing, we ﬁx τ1 = 0.01 µs, close to the value from [14].

• The slow component lifetime should also be independent of td, but since it is the principle shape

parameter in the long tail of S2, we do not ﬁx it globally. As in the analysis of the zero-diﬀusion

events, we determine τ2 prior to the full S2 ﬁt by ﬁtting an exponential to the tail of the S2 pulse
in the region 9 µs to 20 µs after the pulse start. The ﬁt function is y = Ae−t/τ2 . The value of τ2 is

initialized to the value from the pre-ﬁt, but left free to vary in the full ﬁt.

• We do not expect the fast component fraction, p, to vary with respect to td, but it varies with electro-

luminescence ﬁeld, and therefore varies with respect to radial position in DarkSide-50. Like T , we ﬁx

p on an event-by-event basis, evaluating p(r) as given by Eqn. 12.

• The initial value of σ is given by the value of diﬀusion measured in ICARUS, σinit =

L = 4.8 cm2/s [11].

• The amplitude parameter A is initialized to the total area of the S2 pulse.

• The time oﬀset parameter t0 is expected to vary with each event: for events with more diﬀusion, the

pulse ﬁnding algorithm of the reconstruction will ﬁnd the pulse start relatively earlier with respect to

the pulse peak. We empirically ﬁnd that t0 varies linearly with σ: t0 = −0.25 + 3.06σ, which we use

to set the initial value of the time oﬀset: t0,init = t0(σinit).

The initial values of all the ﬁt parameters are summarized in Tab. 2. Of the original 8 parameters, 4

of them are ﬁxed in the ﬁnal ﬁt of the S2 pulse shape. The remaining free parameters are σ, τ2, A, and

t0. For each event, we re-deﬁne the x-axis such that t = 0 is at the S2 pulse start time as determined by
pulse ﬁnding program, and truncate the waveform leaving the −5 µs to 20 µs region about the newly deﬁned

t = 0. The truncated waveform is down-sampled as discussed in Sec. 2.3, and ﬁt by the maximum likelihood

method.

3.3. Drift velocity

The electron drift velocity vd and mobility µ in LAr under diﬀerent drift ﬁelds are calculated from the

maximum drift time, as shown in Fig. 7, and the height of the TPC drift region. The drift time td is

deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the start times identiﬁed by the reconstruction algorithm for S2 and S1,

14

position to the right of each plateau. Precise values are obtained from a sigmoidal ﬁt utilizing a complementary error function,
shown as curves on the right edge of each histogram. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the

plus the parameter t0 from the ﬁt. The addition of the time oﬀset parameter corrects for the fact that

diﬀusion of the S2 pulse will cause the reconstruction algorithm to identify the S2 start time relatively

earlier than for a pulse with zero diﬀusion.

In fact, t0 is generally negative. The height of the TPC

region is measured to be (35.56 ± 0.05) cm at room temperature. The PTFE will contract (2.0 ± 0.5) % at

the operating temperature of (89.2 ± 0.1) K. This contraction, determined through measurements of the

DarkSide-50 TPC, is in agreement with [19]. 200/150/100 V/cm are named referring to the warm Teﬂon

height, but the appropriate height is used in our actual calculations, resulting in slightly higher ﬁeld values.

Uncertainty from ﬁeld non-uniformity near the grid and the time electrons drift in LAr above the grid are

also considered. Field non-uniformity contributes uncertainty to the ﬁeld strength and therefore the mobility,

as we can only measure the voltage on the electrodes. The values shown in Tab. 3 agree with [11] and [12].

3.4. Results

There are 8.95 × 104 events that pass our selection cuts. We ﬁt the S2 pulse shape to each one. Fig. 8

shows examples of some of the ﬁts. 94.5 % of the events have a reduced χ2 smaller than 1.5, as shown in

Fig. 9. To study the diﬀusion of the ionization electron cloud, we extract the smearing parameter σ for

each event. First, we convert the smearing parameter from a time to a length scale, ignoring the drift-time-

independent smearing (σ0). The physical length σL of the electron cloud just below the grid is related to the

ﬁt parameter σ via Eqn. 6. From Eqn. 2 we expect that σ2

then easily evaluated by ﬁtting a line to the mean of the σ2

L should be linear to td. The diﬀusion constant is
L vs. td distribution:

L = σ2

0 + 2DLtd

(13)

Recall from Sec. 2.1 that theσ0 term accounts for any systematic smearing independent of drift time,

including the initial spread of the electron cloud. In DarkSide-50, σ0 is small relative to σL.

However, as evident in Fig. 10, diﬀusion (σ2

L) is nonlinear with respect to drift time, particularly in
the region with td < 150 µs. The grid mesh used in the DarkSide-50 TPC has 2 mm pitch hexagonal cells.

A COMSOL electric ﬁeld simulation has shown that as electrons travel past the grid the cloud suﬀers

a distortion that adds to the longitudinal spread of the cloud. This eﬀect contributes to the observed

nonlinearity, as smaller electron clouds suﬀer less distortion than larger clouds spread across multiple mesh

cells. The distortion eﬀect saturates for clouds larger than σT = 0.4 mm. Performing a linear ﬁt in the drift
time range of 150 µs to 350 µs avoids the nonuniform ﬁeld eﬀect, as it restricts us to the region in which all

clouds suﬀer the same amount of distortion. An extra ±0.08 cm2/s is assigned as systematic uncertainty to

account for the nonlinearity. This uncertainty is evaluated on simulation results by changing the ﬁt range

within 150 µs to 350 µs.

The value of the diﬀusion constant is sensitive to the range of td used in the linear ﬁt, because of the

observed nonlinearity. Earlier windows tend to give a larger diﬀusion constant. This is also in accordance with

the additional spread of the electron cloud caused by Coulomb repulsion (discussed in Sec. 3.6). Coulomb

repulsion is stronger when the electron cloud has not yet diﬀused, producing a larger eﬀect in the beginning

of the drift and decreasing over time.

Using various ﬁt windows within the td range of 50 µs to 350 µs, we ﬁnd that the diﬀusion constant

varies by ±5 %. Fitting to the td region of 150 µs to 350 µs, in which the relationship between σ2
0 and td is
more approximately linear, the diﬀusion constant is found to be DL = (4.12 ± 0.09) cm2/s. The uncertainty

from the ﬁt is negligible due to the high statistics, the main contribution is from the uncertainty of the

nonlinearity and electron drift velocity. The total uncertainty on DL is systematics dominated and is
discussed in the following section. We quote the results from ﬁtting Eqn. 13 in the range of 150 µs to 350 µs

without subtraction of the Coulomb repulsion eﬀect to remain consistent with the literature.

3.5. Systematics

We estimate the systematic uncertainty on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a few diﬀerent ways. As discussed,

we evaluate the uncertainty arising from the nonlinear relationship between diﬀusion and drift time by

varying the ﬁt range applied to simulation results. We also repeat the full analysis on various data sets. We

use diﬀerent r and S2 slices from the same set of runs used to produce the results of the previous section, as

well as data taken at diﬀerent extraction ﬁelds.

3.5.1. Vary r and S2 slices

Ideally, DL should be independent of r and S2 size. The analysis chain is applied identically to the same

runs using the same cuts, but selecting events in diﬀerent r and S2 slices. We choose 8 additional slices:

18

020406080100120050100150200250300350400s]m [dt00.10.20.30.40.50.6]2 [mm2Ls• r in the ranges [0,3), [3,6), [6,9), [12,15) cm all with S2 in the range [4, 5] ×104PE.

• S2 in the ranges [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4) ×104PE all with r in the range [9,12) cm.

The event-by-event S2 ﬁt procedure is identical to Sec. 3.2, and the results are shown in Fig. 11. Only events

with reduced χ2<1.5 (94.5 % of all events) are selected for all slices. The extracted diﬀusion constants agree

to within 3 % for the various r slices and 5 % for the various S2 slices. There is a systematic bias towards

larger DL for larger r and S2.

The bias might be explained by Coulomb repulsion. Stronger repulsion drives the ﬁtting result of DL

to larger values. Events with larger S2 have a higher electron spatial density and therefore stronger self-

repulsion during drift. Since the S2 light yield is lower towards the edge of the TPC [6], events with the

same number of S2 photoelectrons at larger r have a larger electron population than is observed, and are

therefore subject to a stronger repulsion. This assumption is examined by simulation in Sec. 3.6.

3.5.2. Vary extraction ﬁeld

Similarly, DL should be independent of the extraction ﬁeld. Due to operational constraints, high statistics

data were taken at only one other extraction ﬁeld, 2.3 kV/cm. We repeat the analysis chain applied to

standard extraction ﬁeld data, but must regenerate the T (r) and p(r) functions since the electron drift time

across the gas pocket and the fast component fraction depend on the electroluminescence ﬁeld. We repeat

the analysis of Sec. 2.5 with no modiﬁcations. The T and p distributions change but remain consistent
with the forms of Eqn. 11 and 12. The relevant parameters now have the values AT = (1.135 ± 0.001) µs,
BT = (488 ± 2) cm2 and Ap = (8.52 ± 0.02) × 10−2, Bp = (275 ± 1) cm2, as shown in Fig. 12.

Using the new T (r) and p(r) functions, we repeat the analysis chain of Sec. 3.1 and 3.2 and extract the

σ2
L vs. td distribution. Due to the lower statistics relative to standard ﬁeld data, we extend the r and S2
slices to include 0 cm to 18 cm and (1 − 5) × 104 PE, respectively. With the reduced electroluminescence

ﬁeld, we are probing a higher range of event energies. The mean of the resulting σ2 vs. td distribution is

shown in Fig. 13. We see that there is an overall shift in the distribution, which is expected since, with the

lower electroluminescence ﬁeld, the electrons are more slowly extracted from the LAr surface and drifted in

the gas. The slope, and therefore also DL, is consistent with the results of other data sets.

3.5.3. Summary of systematics

The values of the longitudinal diﬀusion constant extracted from the various data sets are summarized

in Tab. 4. The given uncertainties on DL are dominated by the uncertainty in the drift velocity. The

uncertainty on σ0 is attributable to statistical uncertainties and the systematics introduced by ﬁxing the

ﬁtting parameters T (r) and p(r). We obtain an average value of the diﬀusion constant by weighting the

measured DL from diﬀerent r slices with the number of events in each slice, giving equal weight per unit S2
energy, and ﬁnally giving equal weight to the two extraction ﬁelds. The result is DL = (4.09 ± 0.12) cm2/s,

where the uncertainty is dominated by systematics arising from variations in S2 size, radius (R), extraction

ﬁeld, and the uncertainty from nonlinearity.

Coulomb repulsion

In Tab. 4 and Fig. 10, we observe that the longitudinal diﬀusion constant is systematically growing

with S2 and σ2

L is not strictly linear with td as expected from Eqn. 13. These observations can be at least
partially explained by the eﬀect of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons during drift. Adopting a similar

approach as [20], we simulate the distribution of electrons undergoing both diﬀusion and Coulomb repulsion

to examine this eﬀect.

After the primary ionization and recombination process, we assume that the electron cloud that separated

from positive ions has a Gaussian spatial distribution with an appropriate initial spread (30 µm), which is

estimated based on simulation results from G4DS [6]. During drift, the electric ﬁeld at each electron is

dominated by the drifting ﬁeld, so the repulsive movement of an electron relative to the center of the

electron cloud is

vr = (E − Ed)µ = Erµ

(14)

where Ed is the drift ﬁeld and Er is the repulsive ﬁeld generated by the other electrons in the cloud according

to Coulomb’s law, and µ is the electron mobility, which is assumed to be constant as Er (cid:28) Ed. In each
0.5 µs time interval, ignoring the diﬀerence between DL and DT in Eqn. 1, electrons take a random walk

according to the diﬀusion constant DL and a repulse given by Er at that point.

∆r = ∆tvr + ∆rd

(15)

where ∆rd is a random vector following a 3D Gaussian distribution with isotropic variance σ2 = 2DL∆t.

That is to say, for simplicity we assume the diﬀusion is isotropic. The distribution of the electron cloud will

be distorted slightly away from a Gaussian by the Coulomb force, so we use the RMS of electron positions

along the z direction in place of the standard deviation, σL, in Eqn. 13. As the electron number in each

cloud is on the order of 103 , random ﬂuctuations are large after many time intervals. The ﬁnal result is

averaged over an ensemble of 2 × 105 simulated events.

Since the TPC does not measure charge directly, we take the S2 PE yield per drifting electron as a tuning

parameter while assuming that the yield is constant within the energy range (1 − 5) × 104 PE. Finally, we

tune the simulation to the 4 data distributions shown in Fig. 11b using 3 parameters: the longitudinal

diﬀusion constant DL, the S2 PE yield (YS2, deﬁned as the detected number of PE per electron drifted to

gas pocket), and a constant to account for any other systematic drift time-independent smearing (σ0). The

results are shown in Fig. 14.

Diﬀusion curves at diﬀerent S2 energy and r slices can be ﬁt well with the same DL and σ0 while only
tuning YS2. After decoupling the systematic inﬂuence of radius on S2 yield, we get DL = (3.88 ± 0.05) cm2/s.

The uncertainty comes from the statistics of the simulation results. This number is systematically smaller

than the results in Tab. 5, which is to be expected as Coulomb repulsion contributes to the spread of electrons

in a drifting electron cloud. The paper published by the ICARUS collaboration also pointed out this bias [11].

YS2 decreases with increasing radius in the simulation results, in agreement with the other studies of S2 yield

22

in DarkSide-50 [6]. Unfortunately, in order to match the energy dependence observed in the data we require

an S2 yield that is ∼2 times lower than has been measured through independent calibration analyses (not

published). Restricting our S2 yield to the measured value cannot replicate the S2-dependence that we see

in the data. The simulation was also replicated with initial electron distributions exhibiting some spread in

either the longitudinal or transverse direction, but the results were not suﬃcient to resolve the discrepancy

in YS2. Due to this discrepancy, we do not include the Coulomb repulsion eﬀect when reporting our ﬁnal

result.

3.7. Comparison to literature

In order to make a reasonable comparison of the measured longitudinal diﬀusion constant to literature,

we deﬁne the eﬀective electron energy, (cid:15)L [21]. At low drift electric ﬁelds as in this study, the electrons are

thermal (i.e. have nearly no extra energy from the ﬁeld. Previous studies have shown that electrons start

heating above 200 V/cm in LAr [21–23]). It is interesting to note that the relationship between electron

temperature and electric ﬁeld strength in liquid xenon is much stronger. As seen in Ref. [24], the electron

temperature rises dramatically with ﬁeld, even at ﬁeld strengths lower than considered here (< 100 V/cm).

At the drift ﬁelds considered in this analysis for liquid argon, diﬀusion of the electron cloud should follow

the Einstein-Smoluchowski diﬀusion equation

DL =

kT
e

µ

(16)

where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the medium, and e is the charge of the electron.

In higher drift ﬁelds, drifting electrons are no longer thermal. The eﬀective electron energy associated with

longitudinal diﬀusion can then be deﬁned as

(cid:15)L =

DL
µ

(17)

At low drift ﬁeld (cid:15)L should be approximately kT /e. In this study T = 89.2 K and kT = 7.68 meV

We repeat our analysis on atmospheric argon background data taken at two diﬀerent drift ﬁelds, 100 V/cm

and 150 V/cm, to compare to the nominal 200 V/cm drift ﬁeld data. All data are taken with 2.8 kV/cm

extraction ﬁeld. The event selection criteria are nearly identical to those used in the main analysis. However,

due to reduced statistics in lower drift ﬁeld data set, we take a wider slice in the r vs. S2 plane: for all 3

drift ﬁelds, we use r in the range 0 cm to 15 cm, and S2 in the range (1 − 5) × 104 PE. The event-by-event

ﬁt procedure is identical to that of the standard drift ﬁeld data. In particular, since the electroluminescence

ﬁeld is unchanged, we use the same T (r) and p(r) functions given by Eqn. 11 and 12, respectively. The

results are shown in Fig. 15. Results of the linear ﬁt of Eqn. 13 to the points in Fig. 15 are shown in Tab. 5.

Error estimation is the same as for the previous analysis. Besides the uncertainties in the table, we assign

the same total systematic error to the values, which are shown in Fig 16

We evaluate (cid:15)L separately for each drift ﬁeld using the appropriate mobility value from Tab. 3 and the

measured DL without subtraction of the Coulomb repulsion eﬀect. Results are shown in Fig. 16, along

introducing Coulomb repulsion and a r-dependent S2 yield. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend,

with results from other experiments and models. All data points representing experimental measurements

are normalized to 87 K assuming a linear T dependence of (cid:15)L at very low drift ﬁeld. The curve represents

the model of Atrazhev and Timoshkin [21], which is calculated based on a variable phase method near the

argon triple point (83.8 K). The data from Li et al [12] was taken using electrons generated from an Au

photocathode excited by a picosecond laser with a beam size of 1 mm at 87 K, while the ICARUS [11] data

was taken with cosmic muon tracks with a minimum ionizing particle density of (4 − 5.5) × 103 e/mm at 92 K.

The uncertainty of ICARUS data is calculated by the same method as described by Li et al. The electron

density reported by Li et al is even lower than ICARUS. Neither work implements a correction based on the

Coulomb repulsion eﬀect.

The results from literature are systematically higher than the results from this work, but our measurement

is closer to the thermal energy. We should note here that the data in [12] were taken over drift lengths between

2 cm and 6 cm, which corresponds to the 0 − 60µs region in our Fig. 11 or 13 where the non-linearity is most

signiﬁcant. As both setups consist of a ﬁeld cage with shaping rings and a grid electrode to apply an

extraction ﬁeld (named collection ﬁeld in [12]), it is reasonable to expect a higher diﬀusion constant from a

energy might come from electron heating caused by the drift ﬁeld. The increase in (cid:15)L with drift ﬁeld is

discernible with the given uncertainty, indicating that the drifting electrons in the 100 V/cm to 200 V/cm

drift ﬁeld range is not completely thermal.

4. Summary

We have performed a precise measurement of the longitudinal electron diﬀusion constant in liquid argon

using the DarkSide-50 dual-phase TPC. Radial variation of the electroluminescence ﬁeld induces a strong

radial dependence in the S2 pulse shape, particularly the time to the peak of the pulse, T , and the fast

component fraction, p. This radial variation is accounted for by determining T (r) and p(r) using events

from the uppermost layer of the liquid where diﬀusion is negligible.

The measured longitudinal diﬀusion constant is (4.12 ± 0.09) cm2/s for a selection of 140 keV electron

recoil events subject to a 200 V/cm drift ﬁeld at 89.2 K. To study the systematics of our measurement we

examined datasets of varying event energy, ﬁeld strength, and detector volume yielding a weighted average

value for the diﬀusion constant of (4.09 ± 0.12) cm2/s, where the uncertainty is systematics dominated.

Results at all examined drift ﬁelds are systematically lower than other measured values in literature, but closer

to the prediction of the Einstein-Smoluchowski diﬀusion equation, assuming thermalized electrons. Coulomb

repulsion within the drifting electron cloud might contribute to a larger diﬀusion constant. However, from

simulation results we conclude that the Coulomb repulsion eﬀect might not fully account for the increase in

the diﬀusion constant with S2 energy (i.e. more drifting electrons). Further study is needed to explain the

energy dependence of σ2
0.
