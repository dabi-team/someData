Abstract. The nuclear potential and resulting shell structure are well established for the valley
of stability, however, dramatic modiﬁcations to the familiar ordering of single-particle orbitals in
rare isotopes with a large imbalance of proton and neutron numbers have been found: new shell
gaps emerge and conventional magic numbers are no longer valid. This article outlines some of
the recent in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy measurements at NSCL aimed at shedding light on the
evolution of nuclear structure around neutron number N = 28 in neutron-rich Ar and S isotopes.

(Received April 2, 2018)

1. Introduction
Experiments on neutron-rich Si, S, and Ar isotopes continue to revolutionize our understanding
of the changes in nuclear structure encountered at the extremes of isospin [1, 2, 3, 4], starting
with the observation that the N = 28 shell closure may not persist for neutron-rich nuclei more
than 20 years ago [5, 6] and continuing today with the discovery of shape [7] and conﬁguration
coexistence [8, 9, 10, 11] in 44S, for example.

Recent experiments at the NSCL [12] used in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy with fast beams of
rare isotopes [13] to explore, for key isotopes or isotopic chains, the single-particle structure
from direct reactions or the detailed level structure as populated in fragmentation reactions,
respectively. Figure 1 highlights, on the nuclear chart, the nuclei for which the results are
reviewed in the present article.

One way of probing nuclear structure in a quantitative way is through the use of direct
nuclear reactions that selectively probe speciﬁc degrees of freedom, e.g. the proton and neutron
single-particle degrees of freedom.
Intriguing possibilities arise when the single-particle and
single-hole structure of a nucleus can be probed for protons and neutrons, using, for example,
fast-beam one-nucleon pickup [14, 15, 16] and one-nucleon-knockout [17] reactions with γ-ray
detection to deduce the partial cross sections for the population of individual ﬁnal states. Other
less selective reactions, as for example secondary fragmentation of fast projectiles, populate the
low-lying excited states of nuclei and can provide a ﬁrst glimpse at the excitation level schemes
of exotic nuclei [13].

At NSCL, for the measurements described in the following, the γ-ray spectroscopy was
performed with either GRETINA [18] or SeGA [19] in coincidence with the detection of the
projectile-like reaction residues in the S800 spectrograph [20]. The γ rays emitted by the

 
 
 
 
 
 
projectiles in ﬂight (v/c ≈ 0.3) are detected with large Doppler shifts in the laboratory frame and
the segmentation or position sensitivity of the γ-ray spectroscopy arrays is needed to event-by-
event Doppler reconstruct the γ-ray transitions into the reference frame of the reaction residue.
All reaction residues are identiﬁed and characterized using the particle’s time of ﬂight and energy
loss as measured with beam line timing scintillators and the S800 focal-plane detection system.

The following sections brieﬂy summarize recent experiments performed at NSCL: The study
of 47Ar in the one-neutron pickup reaction from 46Ar and the one-proton knockout from 48K [27],
the ﬁrst observation of excited states in 45S, and the detailed study of excited-state level schemes
of neutron-rich S isotopes approaching N = 28 from secondary fragmentation.

2. Learning from N = 29 – A complementary approach
The role of the Ar isotopes around N = 28 is of great interest. They are, with element number
Z = 18, located between doubly-magic 48Ca and the already collective S isotopes [6] (Z = 16)
on the path toward 42Si [21], which has the lowest-lying 2+
1 state along the N = 28 isotonic
chain.

The nucleus 46Ar has challenged existing shell model calculations which overpredict the B(E2)
excitation strength to the ﬁrst 2+ state [5, 22, 23, 24], while describing well other observables,
most recently related to masses of the Ar isotopes around N = 28, for example [25]. This is not
without experimental controversy, where an excited-state lifetime measurement yields higher
collectivity in agreement with shell model calculations [26], but disagrees with several Coulomb
excitation measurements that consistently yield a lower B(E2) value [5, 22, 24].

Reminded in the following is the study of 47Ar using two complementary intermediate-energy
nuclear reactions, 12C(46Ar,47Ar+γ)X , and 9Be(48K,47Ar+γ)X and the ﬁrst spectroscopy of 45S
accomplished with a one-proton removal reaction from 46Cl projectiles [27].

2.1. Single-neutron particle and single-proton hole strength
We have presented a comprehensive spectroscopy of 47Ar performed using two complementary
direct reactions, one-neutron pickup onto 46Ar projectiles and one-proton removal from the 1−
ground state of 48K. Both of the state-of-the-art SDPF-U and SDPF-MU shell-model eﬀective
interactions provided a good description of the data, with (a) SDPF-U in better agreement with
the 47Ar excitation energies and the location of the neutron spectroscopic strength, and (b)
SDPF-MU describing better the 47Ar yield from proton removal from the 2s1/2 orbital in the
48K ground state [27]. Figure 2 summarizes the results.

2.2. Reaching the furthest in the chain of S isotopes
From the 9Be(46Cl,45S+γ)X one-proton removal reaction,
the ﬁrst observation of γ-ray
transitions in 45S was accomplished. This makes 45S the most neutron-rich odd-A sulfur isotope
with spectroscopic information available, while 46S is still the heaviest S isotope successfully
accessed with γ-ray spectroscopy [28] to date. From comparisons with shell model calculations,
and arguments based on intensities and energy sums, a ﬁrst tentative level scheme for 45S was
proposed. The 45S γ-ray spectrum is broadly consistent with expectations when assuming a 1−
46Cl ground-state spin and the the corresponding proton spectroscopic factors from the SDPF-
U interaction. Opportunities to advance our understanding of the N = 29 nucleus 45S will
emerge once the ground-state spin of 46Cl is known, after which a more quantitative analysis,
as done for 47Ar, can be performed for the one-proton removal data [27]. Figure 3 shows the

3. Approaching N = 28 in the chain of S isotopes
We have performed in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy on neutron-rich sulfur isotopes populated by
fragmentation of intermediate-energy 48Ca and 46Ar projectile beams. New transitions were
identiﬁed in 39−42S and new level schemes for 40−42S were proposed from γγ coincidence
information, energy sums and comparison to shell model. Shell-model calculations with the
SDPF-MU Hamiltonian provideed remarkable agreement and consistency with the proposed level
schemes. For the odd-mass 41S, a level scheme is presented that appears complete below 2.2 MeV
and consistent with the predictions by SDPF-MU shell-model Hamiltonian (see Figure 4); this
is a remarkable benchmark given the rapid shell and shape evolution prevalent in this textbook
isotopic chain as the diminished N = 28 shell gap is approached.

As detailed in Ref. [29], for the even-mass S isotopes, the evolution of the yrast sequence was
discussed in terms of E(6+)/E(2+) and E(4+)/E(2+) energy ratios. For 42S, a candidate for the
2+
2 state could be proposed that displays a unique decay branching as compared to the lighter
38,40S. This was shown to be rooted in its neutron single-particle structure and conﬁrmed by
the SDPF-MU shell-model calculations.

As to the population of excited states in fragmentation reactions, a consistent picture
emerged. Transitions from yrast states were most prominent, evident even at low statistics.
For the higher statistics cases, e.g. 40,41,42S, the presence of many weaker transitions became
apparent that most certainly feed the low-lying level schemes. While this may always have been
the assumption behind the population of excited states in fragmentation reactions, evidence
was presented for the many feeding transitions that have remained unobserved in previous work
discussing fragmentation reactions speciﬁcally for S isotopes [30]. In the case of 41S(42S), all
calculated negative(positive) parity states below 2.2 MeV(3.5 MeV) were matched to states of
the proposed level schemes, including oﬀ-yrast states. A number of weaker transitions remained
unplaced.

4. Summary
Neutron-rich Ar and S nuclei continue to provide important benchmarks for nuclear theory in
the quest to unravel the driving forces of shell and shape evolution. The results from recent in-
beam γ-ray spectroscopy studies on 47Ar, 45S, and 38−42S were reviewed. In general, very good
agreement between measured results and large-scale shell model calculations was demonstrated.
