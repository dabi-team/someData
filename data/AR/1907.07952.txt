Abstract Magnetic ﬁeld data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory were utilized to explore the
changes in the magnetic energy of four active regions (ARs) during their emer-
gence. We found that at the very early stage of the magnetic ﬂux emergence, an
abrupt steepening of the magnetic power spectrum takes place leading to rapid
increase of the absolute value of the negative spectra power index α in E(k) ∼
kα. As the emergence proceeds, the energy increases at all scales simultaneously
implying that elements of all sizes do appear in the photosphere. Meanwhile,
the energy gain at scales larger than ≈10 Mm prevails as compared to that at
smaller scales. Both direct (i.e., fragmentation of large structures into smaller
ones) and inverse (i.e., merging of small magnetic features into larger elements)
cascades are readily observed during the emergence. However, in the case of
inverse cascade, the total energy gained at large scales exceeds the energy loss at
smaller scales assuming simultaneous appearance of large-scale magnetic entities
from beneath the photosphere. We conclude that most of the time the energy
may grow at all scales. We also cannot support the point of view regarding
the dominant role of the inverse cascade in the formation of an AR. Although
the coalescence of small magnetic elements into larger pores and sunspots is
observed, our analysis shows that the prevailed energy contribution to an AR
comes from emergence of large-scale structures.

1. Introduction

Last decades a considerable attention was paid to both theoretical and ob-
servational study of magnetic ﬂux emergence on the Sun. The observational
picture of emergence can be described as follows. First visible imprints of an
emerging active region (AR) are small magnetic features of diﬀerent polarities
that appear at the surface and move apart from the emergence site. A strong
transverse magnetic ﬁeld of hundreds or thousands of gauss is observed between
the features (Brants, 1985; Zwaan, 1985; Lites, Skumanich, and Martinez Pillet,
1998). Magnetic elements of opposite polarities migrate to diﬀerent sides of the
emergence site and coalesce to form pores. When the future footpoints of an AR
become separated far enough, small magnetic dipoles start to appear throughout
the emergence site and move toward the footpoints (Centeno, 2012). These mag-
netic dipoles, labeled by Bernasconi et al. (2002) as magnetic dipolar features
(MDF), are presumably series of undulatory Ω- and U -loops of almost horizontal
magnetic ﬂux ropes that connect the AR footpoints. The ropes are seen as
elongated darkenings in the photospheric continuum intensity (e.g., Strous and
Zwaan, 1999). MDF are stitches where the magnetic ﬂux is still tied to the upper
photosphere (Bernasconi et al., 2002). Gradually the reconnections of elementary
U -loops occur. The magnetic ﬂux tubes lose excessive mass and the arc ﬁlament
system rises up above the surface. Pores of the same polarity could merge to
sunspots. More detailed reviews on magnetic ﬂux emergence and AR formation
can be found elsewhere (e.g., van Driel-Gesztelyi and Green, 2015; Cheung et
al., 2017).

The above description of the AR formation might suggest that the magnetic
ﬂux emerges predominantly by small portions rather than as a monolithic struc-
ture. Recent numerical simulations support this qualitative suggestion. For a
review of theoretical aspects of ﬂux emergence see, e.g., Fan (2009); Cheung and
Isobe (2014). Here we mostly focus on recent results reported by Chen, Rempel,
and Fan (2017) since they performed the most realistic comprehensive numerical
3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of magnetic ﬂux emergence so far.

Chen, Rempel, and Fan (2017) considered the emergence of magnetic ﬂux
bundle from the uppermost layers of the convection zone to the corona. Magnetic
and ﬂow ﬁelds, as extracted from a spherical global dynamo simulation by Fan
and Fang (2014), were coupled to the lower boundary of their computational
domain. The simulated magnetic ﬁeld and continuum intensity images at the
solar surface are quite similar to magnetograms and continuum intensity maps
observed by high-resolution instruments. Authors further argue that a magnetic
ﬂux bundle rises as a coherent structure through the convection zone before
reaching the uppermost several Mm below the photosphere. At these depths, the
ﬂux bundle fragments into magnetic tubes that emerge individually. During the
ﬁrst stages of magnetic ﬂux emergence, only small-scale granular-size magnetic
elements appear at the solar surface. They gradually coalesce to form larger
magnetic ﬂux concentrations that appear as pores in the intensity map. As the
emergence proceeds, pores seem to merge to sunspots.

Both theoretical and observational results mentioned above suggest that co-
alescence of small-scale magnetic features with formation of larger structures

SOLA: ms1_final.tex; 19 July 2019; 0:50; p. 2

Magnetic Power Spectra of Emerging ARs

is dominant during the magnetic ﬂux emergence. This process is referred to as
inverse turbulent cascade (e.g., Biskamp, 1993), when the energy from small
scales transfers to larger scales. The preliminary observational evidence of the
inverse cascade was reported, for the ﬁrst time, by Hewett et al. (2008) basing
on low-resolution magnetograms of a peculiar, fast-emerging strong AR NOAA
10488. The authors used full-disk magnetograms obtained by the Michelson
Doppler Imager on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI,
Scherrer et al., 1995). At the same time, since emergence occurs in a highly
turbulent medium of solar plasma, an opposite process – the direct cascade, i.e.,
fragmentation of large magnetic structures into smaller ones – should take place
as well. Using modern magnetographic data for a set of ARs, we aim to explore
the interplay between magnetic energy loss and gain at diﬀerent spatial scales
and to ﬁnd out whether the inverse cascade is a common property of emergence.
The magnetic energy spectrum is a very useful technique to estimate the
amount of magnetic energy stored at diﬀerent spatial scales, as well as the energy
transfer along scales. In this study, we use a method for the 1D power spectrum
acquisition (Abramenko et al., 2001; Abramenko, 2005). The method is based
on the Fast Fourier Transform of 2D-magnetograms.

Uninterruptible high-cadence and high-spatial-resolution magnetic ﬁeld data
provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO/HMI, Scherrer et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2012) allowed us to
explore in details the changes in the magnetic energy spectrum during the AR
emergence. We focus on time changes of the power index (the slope of the spec-
trum), as well on signatures of energy decrease at large scales with simultaneous
increase at smaller scales, i.e, direct cascade, and on opposite process, i.e., inverse
cascade.

2. Data Reduction and Power Spectra Calculation

We employed line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld measurements provided by SDO/HMI.
The instrument is a full-disk ﬁltergraph that routinely acquires narrow-band
ﬁltergrams of the full disk of the Sun by two CCDs (“front” and “side” cameras,
Schou et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). The spatial resolution of 4096×4096 pixels
ﬁltergrams is 1” with a 0.5” pixel size. The side camera is aimed at vector mag-
netic ﬁeld measurements. It performs ﬁltergrams acquisition in six polarization
states at six wavelengths positions within the photospheric spectral line Fe i 6173
˚A(Norton et al., 2006). It takes 135 s to acquire a full set of 36 ﬁltergrams. In
order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the Stokes parameters are computed
every 720 s from ﬁltegrams averaged over 1350 s of data (Couvidat et al., 2012b).
LOS observables are produced from ﬁltergrams acquired in right-circular
(RCP) and left-circular polarization (LCP) states (12 of 36 ﬁltergrams). To
derive full-disk LOS magnetograms used in this work, the so-called MDI-like
algorithm is applied (Couvidat et al., 2012a). Brieﬂy, the magnetic ﬁeld is
proportional to the diﬀerence of Doppler velocities obtained from the observed
spectral line in RCP and LCP. Look-up tables are used to correct the derived
Doppler velocities for the ﬁnite width of the ﬁlter proﬁles, orbital velocity of

SOLA: ms1_final.tex; 19 July 2019; 0:50; p. 3

O.K Kutsenko et al.

the satellite, asymmetry of the spectral line, etc. The ﬁlling factor in SDO/HMI
magnetic ﬁeld measurements is assumed equal to unity. Consequently, the values
in magnetogram pixels are magnetic ﬂux densities over the pixel area rather than
magnetic ﬁeld strength. The noise in the full-disk 720-s LOS magnetograms
varies between 4.8 Mx cm-2 at the disk center and 7.9 Mx cm-2 near the solar
limb (Liu et al., 2012).

SDO/HMI LOS magnetic ﬁeld become saturated every 12 hours if the mag-
netic ﬂux density in a pixel exceeds 3200 Mx cm-2 (Liu et al., 2012). The reason
for this saturation is the spectral line shift beyond a well-calibrated part of the
calibration curve due to combined action of large Zeeman and Doppler shifts.
The latter is determined by the velocity of the geostationary satellite relative to
the Sun. The 12- and 24-hour periodicities might also contribute to weaker LOS
magnetic ﬁelds (Kutsenko and Abramenko, 2016). However, we did not reveal
the existence of these periodicities in our analysis.

Full set of acquired Stokes parameters is also inverted (Borrero et al., 2011)
and disambiguated (Metcalf, 1994; Leka et al., 2009) to retrieve the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld. The data are available in the form of full-disk vector magnetograms
or vector magnetic ﬁeld patches of ARs (Bobra et al., 2014; Hoeksema et al.,
2014). The noise in vector magnetic ﬁeld data is about two orders of magnitude
higher than that in LOS observables (values of magnetic ﬂux density below 220
Mx cm-2 in the vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements should be assumed as noise
according to Bobra et al., 2014). This is the reason that motivated us to use
LOS magnetograms instead of vector magnetic ﬁeld data in this work.

For each analyzed AR, we compiled a series of LOS magnetic ﬁeld patches
extracted from full-disk magnetograms. Emerging ARs, as well as the quiet-Sun
areas where they appeared, were tracked as long as the centers of the patches
were located within ±30 heliographic degrees from the central meridian. To
further minimize the projection errors, the µ-correction for each pixel in the
patches was performed (e.g., Leka, Barnes, and Wagner, 2017) before calculation
of power spectra. The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, Φ, was also computed as
a sum of absolute magnetic ﬂux densities in pixels multiplied by the corrected
area of a pixel. The summation was performed only over those pixels where the
absolute magnetic ﬂux density value exceeded 18 Mx cm-2 – the triple standard
deviation noise level (Liu et al., 2012).

To calculate the magnetic power spectra of ARs, we use an approach de-
veloped in Abramenko et al. (2001); Abramenko (2005). Brieﬂy, the 2D power
spectrum of a LOS magnetogram acquired at time t was calculated as a squared
Fast Fourier Transform of the magnetogram. Then 1D power spectrum E(k, t)
was then retrieved. Here k = 2π/r is the wavenumber and r is the spatial scale
(in Megameters, Mm). E(k, t) was calculated by summing the 2D-spectrum over
a thin ring in the 2D-space of wavenumbers (see Abramenko, 2005, for details).
Usually, the inertial range is well visible in each spectrum as a linear interval
in a double-logarithmic plot, so that E(k, t) ∝ kα with the power index α(t).
We computed α(t) from the best linear approximation to the data points inside
a range ∆r=2.7–10 Mm. The choice of the range is based on results reported
in (Abramenko et al., 2001; Abramenko, 2005): for SOHO/MDI high resolution
data, at scales lower than approximately 3 Mm the power index calculation is

SOLA: ms1_final.tex; 19 July 2019; 0:50; p. 4

Magnetic Power Spectra of Emerging ARs

marginally aﬀected by the inﬂuence of noise and insuﬃcient resolution of the
telescope. We found that in the case of SDO/HMI data, the lower limit can
be extended to 2.7-2.4 Mm. We further use the value of 2.7 Mm as the most
reliable high-frequency limit of the inertial range. Mandage and McAteer (2016)
argued that the large-scale limit of the inertial range depends on the AR being
analyzed and could be extended above 10 Mm. The extension of the inertial
range is obviously caused by presence of large-scale magnetic structures such
as sunspots. However, since we intend to obtain homogeneous estimates of the
power index α for both quiet, pre-emergence photosphere and AR areas, we
adopted the large-scale limit of the inertial range r=10 Mm where the inﬂuence
of large sunspots on the spectrum is negligible.

To analyze time variations of the energy transfer along the spectrum, we
calculated the partial time derivative of the power spectrum, ∂E(k, t)/∂t: for
each k the derivative along the time axis was computed. Five-point stencil
was used to perform numerical diﬀerentiation. Using the customary notation
in turbulence theory (e.g., Biskamp, 1993), we will refer to this function as
nonlinear energy transfer function.

3. Results

Four emerging NOAA ARs under study are listed in Table 1. Second column
shows the beginning and the end of analyzed time interval. The total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux at the maximum of AR development is presented in the last col-
umn. All ARs developed into moderate bipolar magnetic structures obeying Hale
polarity law and Joy’s law. Only one of them, the largest AR 11726, revealed
a peculiarity: the following-polarity spot was a dominating feature between
other sunspots in the group. The time interval of our analysis covered the pre-
emergence phase as well when no signatures of emerging magnetic structures
appeared at the photosphere.

3.1. Evolution of the Power Index α(t)

Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate how the magnetic power spectrum evolves as the
magnetic structure emerges. The spectra are separated by the 24-hour interval
starting from the lightest grey curve in each panel. As an AR emerges, the power
spectrum becomes steeper, and positive energy increment over a day is visible
at all scales. The linear range of 2.7–10 Mm, where the power index α was cal-
culated, is enclosed between dotted vertical segments. During the pre-emergence
phase, all ARs demonstrate the spectrum with α close to -1, which is expected
for the magnetic power spectrum in the quiet-sun photosphere (Abramenko et
al., 2001). As the AR emerges, the spectrum becomes steeper and value of α
reaches the Kolmogorov’s -5/3 and even more (see, e.g., Abramenko, 2005).

Time variations of the power index α, along with the total unsigned ﬂux, are
shown in Figure 3. The pre-emergence magnitude of α ≈ −1 abruptly changes to
lower magnitudes (higher absolute values) at the time of the very beginning of the
ﬂux growth. As the emergence progresses, the magnitude of α does not change

drop of α only the ﬁrst small magnetic features of the future AR are visible
on the photosphere. Such a drop can serve as an indicator of the near-future
appearance of a (at least) moderate active region.

3.2. Evolution of the Nonlinear Transfer Function ∂E(k, t)/∂t

Since the nonlinear energy transfer function ∂E(k, t)/∂t is a time derivative of
the magnetic energy spectrum, it allows us to better reveal how energy changes at
diﬀerent scales or wavenumbers k from one consecutive magnetogram to another.
Negative values of the nonlinear energy transfer function at certain scales imply
energy loss while positive values are observed if the energy gain took place. The

visual representation of ∂E(k, t)/∂t allows one to see the temporal interplay
(say, simultaneous energy increase at larger scales and energy decrease at smaller
scales) of energy cascades between diﬀerent spatial scales. An example for NOAA
AR 11763 is shown in Figure 4. Shades of red show the energy growth at a given
scale on a given time, whereas blue stripes indicate the energy losses. Some
individual ∂E(k, t)/∂t functions are presented in Figure 5. When we observe
the energy gain at small scales with simultaneous energy loss at large scales,
this is a moment of well pronounced direct cascade, when energy might be
transferred from large to smaller scales. In other words, large-scale entities might
be fragmented. Examples of this situation are visible in Figure 4 (a yellow strip
on small scales is observed simultaneously with blue stripes at large scales; one
of them is marked by DC-arrow), and in Figure 5 (middle row). The opposite
process – inverse cascade – is illustrated in Figure 4 by the IC-arrow and in
Figure 5 (bottom row). On the whole, blue and red-yellow stripes in the k–
t plot constantly alternate each other along the time axis, which means very
inhomogeneous regime of emergence: energy gain can be replaced by energy loss
(and vice versa).

Short intervals when inverse and direct cascades are dominant and well visible
on the k–t plot are rather rare. The regular emergence (RE) regime (Figure 4,
RE-arrow) is the energy gain along the entire spectrum, especially at scales
above 3 Mm (approximately k < 2, Figure 5, top row). Of cause, both cas-
cades are continuously present in turbulent medium, and they are competing
for the spectrum formation. Anyway, we do not observe any prevalence of the
inverse cascade (formation of large magnetic concentrations predominantly due
to convergence of small ones) during the emergence phase. As for the right-end
boundary of about 3 Mm, this might be related to the inﬂuence of noise and
insuﬃcient resolution on the power spectrum calculations (Abramenko et al.,
2001).

Cadence of analyzed data is 12 minutes, so that consecutive spectra in Figure 4
are separated by the 12-minute intervals. This interval might be not suﬃcient to
properly reveal reorganizations accompanying the dominant turbulent cascade
action. We thus performed the following experiment to visualize the existence of
the inverse cascade on longer time interval.

Figure 6 shows SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms of AR NOAA 11781 acquired
on 2013 June 29. Small-scale elongated magnetic features are clearly seen on
the magnetogram acquired at t0 = 17:24 UT (top-left panel). By the time t1 =
20:00 UT (bottom-left panel), these magnetic features merged with the leading
negative polarity spot, i.e. the inverse cascade is clearly distinguished by visual
means.

We calculated the total energy injection at diﬀerent spatial scales during the
t1
aforementioned interval as R
t0 ∂E(k, t)/∂tdt. The resulting curve is shown in the
right panel of Figure 6. Indeed, the energy decrease at small scales, as well as co-
temporary energy increase at large scales, is observed. However, the total energy
injected at large scales (which can be evaluated as an area above the positive
section of the curve in the right panel of Figure 6) is almost twice higher than
that removed from the small scales. Obviously, along with the inverse cascade,
simultaneous appearance of large-scale magnetic entities does take place.

4. Conclusions and Discussion

We used SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms for four emerging ARs to explore the
inter-scale magnetic energy transfer on the basis of the magnetic power spectrum
technique. Analyzing power spectra and their variations in time, we found the
following:

• At the very early stage of the magnetic ﬂux emergence, when only tiny
magnetic features are visible in the photosphere, an abrupt steepening of
the magnetic power spectrum occurs, which is well pronounced in increasing
of the absolute value of the negative power index α in E(k) ∼ kα. The result
can be useful for early diagnostics of emerging active regions.

• Most of the time the energy increases at all scales simultaneously, implying
that elements of all sizes do appear in the photosphere after the emergence
onset. The energy gain at larger scales prevails as compared to that at
smaller scales.

Figure 5. The slices of the ∂E(k, t)/∂t function at certain moments illustrating three regimes
(regular emergence (upper row), direct cascade (middle row), and inverse cascade (bottom
row)) for ARs NOAA 11726 (left column), 11076 (middle column), and 12275 (right column).
The slices of the ∂E(k, t)/∂t function for AR NOAA 11726 are shown at the moments indicated
by blue arrows in Figure 3.

• Evidences of the direct cascade (when energy from large scales can be
transferred to small scales, i.e., fragmentation), as well as signatures of the
opposite inverse cascade, were revealed. However, in the case of the inverse
cascade, the total energy gained at large scales exceeds the energy loss at
smaller scales, so that along with coalescence of small features, simultaneous
appearance of large-scale magnetic entities does take place.

• The process of emergence displays highly intermittent in time nature: short
periods of energy gain in some scale interval can be quickly replaced by
energy losses, and vice versa, i.e., the trade interactions between scales are
always going on.

We thus observe that during the emergence the magnetic energy grows at all
scales simultaneously, so that the prevailing cascade direction cannot be revealed.

Figure 6.
Illustration of the inverse cascade from 2.5-hour observations. Left – SDO/HMI
LOS magnetograms of AR NOAA 11781, acquired on 2013 June 29 at 17:24 UT (t0, top) and at
20:00 UT (t1, bottom). The size of the ﬁeld-of-view is 150 by 75 arcsec. The magnetograms are
scaled from -500 Mx cm-2 (black) to 500 Mx cm-2 (white). Right – The total energy injection
at diﬀerent wavenumbers accumulated from t0 to t1 and calculated as R

t1
t0 ∂E(k, t)/∂tdt.

Both direct and inverse cascades can be well pronounced during the emergence.
However, we cannot support the point of view regarding the dominant role of the
inverse cascade (merging of small features into the larger ones) in the formation
of an AR. Although the coalescence of small magnetic elements into larger pores
and sunspots is observed, the prevailed energy contribution to the AR comes
from emergence of large-scale structures.

According to turbulence theory (see, e.g., Biskamp, 1993), the energy input
at some scale interval is followed by redistribution of energy along the spectrum
in both directions: as toward smaller scales (direct cascade), so to larger scales
(inverse cascade). Energy redistribution along the spectrum requires some ﬁnite
time. This can be a reason why in our study a signature of inverse cascade is
better visible when data accumulation is applied (see Figure 6). At the same
time, highly intermittent nature of the nonlinear transfer function ∂E(k, t)/∂t
(see Figure 4) does not allow us to go in data accumulation very deeply. We
presume that the HMI cadence of 12 min is a suitable time interval to reveal
the cascade direction. Our visual analysis of magnetograms (not shown) as well
as high-resolution observations of Bernasconi et al. (2002) suggested that small
magnetic elements ﬂowing around during the AR emergence have lifetimes from
tens of minutes to hours and a linear size of order of 1 Mm, so we can catch
majority of them.

To conclude, our results suggest that emergence of an AR is an intermittent
rather than a monotonous process. Short-term intervals of energy increase are
followed by intervals of energy decrease at diﬀerent scales that can be explained
by the turbulent nature of photospheric plasma interacting with emerging mag-
netic ﬂux. A direct and inverse cascades operate simultaneously and, for the
majority of time, they contribute to the energy gain at all scales.
