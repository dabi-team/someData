ABSTRACT

We study the clustering properties of fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that occurred during
solar cycles 23 and 24. We apply two methods: the Max spectrum method can detect the predom-
inant clusters and the de-clustering threshold time method provides details on the typical clustering
properties and time scales. Our analysis shows that during the diﬀerent phases of solar cycles 23 and
24, CMEs with speed ≥ 1000 km/s preferentially occur as isolated events and in clusters with on
average two members. However, clusters with more members appear particularly during the maximum
phases of the solar cycles. Over the total period and in the maximum phases of solar cycles 23 and
24, about 50% are isolated events, 18% (12%) occur in clusters with 2 (3) members, and another 20%
in larger clusters ≥ 4, whereas in solar minimum fast CMEs tend to occur more frequently as isolated
events (62%). During diﬀerent solar cycle phases, the typical de-clustering time scales of fast CMEs
are τc = 28 − 32 hrs, irrespective of the very diﬀerent occurrence frequencies of CMEs during solar
minimum and maximum. These ﬁndings suggest that τc for extreme events may reﬂect the charac-
teristic energy build-up time for large ﬂare and CME-proliﬁc active ARs. Associating statistically the
clustering properties of fast CMEs with the Disturbance storm index Dst at Earth suggests that fast
CMEs occuring in clusters tend to produce larger geomagnetic storms than isolated fast CMEs. This
may be related to CME-CME interaction producing a more complex and stronger interaction with the
Earth magnetosphere.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a manifestation of solar variability and the main source of major space weather
events. CMEs eject substantial amounts of mass and magnetic ﬂux from the Sun to the Heliosphere and cause
disturbances in the interplanetary medium (Gopalswamy et al. 2009). The CME initiation and impulsive acceleration
occur on time scales of a few minutes to several hours with a kinetic energy that may exceed 1032 ergs (Bein et al.
2011; Hudson et al. 2006; Vourlidas et al. 2000; Schwenn 1996; Hundhausen et al. 1984). CME speeds range from
< 100 km/s to > 2000 km/s, occasionally reaching up to 3500 km/s (Webb & Howard 2012; Chen 2011; Gopalswamy
et al. 2009; Yashiro et al. 2004). During their propagation, the interplanetary manifestations of the CMEs (ICME) may
interact with the Earth (and other planets), producing space weather impacts on their environment and technology
(Riley et al. 2018; Baker et al. 2013; Schwenn 2006).

The characteristics of extreme solar phenomena and extreme space weather events help us to better understand the
dynamics and variability of the Sun as well as the physical mechanisms behind these events (Koskinen et al. 2017;

Green et al. 2018). In this article, we will characterize extreme events in the form of fast CMEs. Large ﬂares and
fast CMEs predominantly originate from complex active regions that contain large amounts of magnetic ﬂux (Toriumi
& Wang 2019; Murray et al. 2018; Tschernitz et al. 2018; Sammis et al. 2000). Observations have shown that active
regions tend to occur in clusters. This behavior is related to the magnetic ﬂux emergence of new active regions, which
preferably emerge in the vicinity of old ones (Ruzmaikin et al. 2011; Ruzmaikin 1998; Gaizauskas et al. 1983; Harvey
& Zwaan 1993).

Multiple CMEs launched from complex active regions are not rare. Ruzmaikin et al. (2011) showed that fast CMEs
in particular tend to occur in clusters. This clustering may lead to interactions of successive CMEs, either already
close to the Sun or in interplanetary space. Solar observations reveal that CME-CME interaction occurs in particular
for CMEs that are launched in sequence from the same active region. During their propagation from the Sun to Earth,
the CME-CME interaction can be related to enhanced particle acceleration and can generate more intense geomagnetic
storms than isolated CMEs when arriving at Earth (Lugaz et al. 2017; Vennerstrom et al. 2016; Dumbovi´c et al. 2015;
Farrugia & Berdichevsky 2004).

Here we study the temporal distribution of fast CMEs, with main focus on the statistical interpretation of the
occurrence and clustering properties of CMEs, how these changes for diﬀerent solar cycle phases, and also how the
clustering properties may aﬀect the CME’s geo-eﬀectivity. To this aim, we apply two diﬀerent approaches, the Max
Spectrum method and the de-clustering threshold time (Stoev et al. 2006; Ruzmaikin et al. 2011; Ferro & Segers
2003). The Max Spectrum method provides two exponents: the power tail exponent (α) describing the probability
distribution of the speeds of fast CMEs and the extremal index (θ) that separates individual clusters and also provides
an estimate of the predominant cluster size. The de-clustering threshold time is used to identify clusters in time series
of CMEs with speeds larger than 1000 km/s. This method provides information about the cluster size, the mean
cluster duration and the mean time between successive fast CMEs.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the CME data set. In section 3, we explain the Max
Spectrum method and the concept of de-clustering threshold time. In Section 4, the main results of our study on the
clustering of fast CMEs that occurred during solar cycles 23 and 24 are presented. In addition, the same analysis is
performed separately for diﬀerent phases of the solar cycles. In Section 5 we present a statistical approach to relate
the CME clustering properties to their potential geo-eﬀectivity. In Section 6, we summarize our main ﬁndings and
discuss their implications.

2. DATA SET
We use data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph1 (LASCO; Brueckner et al. (1995)) onboard the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. This catalog contains all the CMEs detected by the LASCO
coronagraphs C2 and C3, which cover a combined ﬁeld of view from 2.1 to 32 R(cid:12). The catalog provides several
attributes to characterize the CMEs: date and time of ﬁrst appearance in the coronagraph ﬁeld of view, angular
width, speed from the linear ﬁt to the height-time measurements, speed from the quadratic ﬁt at the last height of
measurement, speed from quadratic ﬁt at 20 R(cid:12) (Gopalswamy et al. 2009; Yashiro et al. 2004). We use the speed
from the quadratic ﬁt at the time/distance of the ﬁrst data point, which gives the speed closer to the initiation of the
CME eruption in the low corona before other interactions occur.

We follow the approach outlined in Ruzmaikin et al. (2011) and build the time series from the hourly spaced time
series of CME speeds. The hours with no CME occurrence are assigned a zero speed. In the few cases where more
than one CME occurred within one hour, the highest CME speed is chosen. We use the entire LASCO data available
from January 1996 to March 2018 (resulting in a total set of 25895 CMEs) covering almost completely the last two
solar cycles. We note that our data also include the recently occurring strongest events of cycle 24, namely the X9.3
and X8.2 ﬂare/CME events from 2017 September 6 and 10 (e.g. Yang et al. (2017); Mitra et al. (2018); Guo et al.
(2018); Seaton & Darnel (2018); Veronig et al. (2018); Liu et al. (2018); Romano et al. (2019)).

mean sunspot number was obtained from WDC-SILSO, Royal Observatory of Belgium (top panel). The second and
third panel show the CME speed and the monthly means of the daily number of CMEs from the CDAW LASCO
Catalog. The monthly mean of the daily number of CMEs with speeds v ≥ 1000 km/s are plotted in the bottom

properties also separately.

dotted lines mark the sub-intervals selected for separate analysis.

Figure 2 shows the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) for the solar cycles 23 and 24 and a close-up of the
distribution for speeds v ≥ 1000 km/s. These PDFs of the CME speeds reveal a non-Gaussian heavy-tailed distribution
(Ruzmaikin et al. 2011; Yurchyshyn et al. 2005). This means that fast CMEs occur with a much higher probability
than expected from a normal or exponential distribution. The distribution of CMEs speeds shown on top has the
mode at 195 km/s, the mean speed is 357 ± 282 km/s. 899 CMEs (3.5% of the overall sample) have speeds exceeding
1000 km/s. 2847 CMEs (11%) have speeds > 700 km/s, and 63 CMEs (0.2%) achieves speeds > 2000 km/s.

The dominant interplanetary phenomena causing intense magnetic storms (Dst < −100 nT ) are the interplanetary
manifestations of fast coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The statistical dependence of Dst minima during storms were

widely explored (Podladchikova et al. 2018; Podladchikova & Petrukovich 2012; Echer et al. 2013, 2008; Kane & Echer
2007). The main properties that determine the geo-eﬀectivity of an ICME impacting the Earth magnetosphere are its
arrival speed and the strength of the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (Borovsky & Denton 2006;
Gonzalez et al. 1999; Gosling et al. 1991). While currently we still have no proper handle to derive estimates of Bz
from solar observations (e.g. Vourlidas et al. (2019); Green et al. (2018)), the ICME speed impacting at Earth (though
evolving in interplanetary space due to the drag force exerted by the ambient solar wind) is related to the CME speed
that we can derive from the coronagraph observations near the Sun (e.g. Vrˇsnak et al. (2013)). Thus, in order to
characterize extreme events, we focus our analysis here in particular on fast CMEs, deﬁned with speeds v > 1000 km/s,
which comprise about 3.5% of the overall sample.

3. METHODS

Here we describe two statistical methods to study and characterize the clustering properties of the fast CMEs. These

are the Max Spectrum and the de-clustering threshold time method.

3.1. Max Spectrum method

The Max Spectrum method is based on the block maxima technique (Stoev et al. 2006). In general a real valued
random variable X with a cumulative distribution function F (x) = P {X ≤ x}, x ∈ R is said to have a right heavy
tail if,

P {X > x} = 1 − F (x) = L(x)x−α, as x → ∞

for some α > 0, where L(x) > 0 is a slowly varying function. The tail exponent α > 0 controls the rate of decay of F
and hence characterizes its tail behavior. If we consider the case where the slowly varying function L is trivial, when

P {X > x} = 1 − F (x) ∼ σα

0 x−α, as x → ∞

(1)

with σ0 and where ∼ means that the ratio of the left-hand side to the right-hand side in Eq.1 tends to 1, as x → ∞.
We assume that the X(i)(cid:48)s are almost surely positive (F (0) = 0) (Stoev et al. 2006).

In the application of this method, we use the hourly times series of CME speeds created, without using a CME
speed threshold. In our case the variable X(i) corresponds to the CMEs speed v(i). This method starts with taking
averages of data maxima in time intervals (blocks) with a ﬁxed size. The block size is then progressively increased.
Here we consider the time series of total length N for the CME speed v(i), where 1 ≤ i ≤ N and j introduce the time
interval scale index j = 1, 2, 3, . . . log2(N ). To form non-overlapping time blocks of length 2j, at each ﬁxed scale j we
calculate the maximum CME speed within each block

D(j, k) = max

time axis.

The blocks of scale j are naturally contained in the blocks of scale (j + 1). Now, we average the binary logarithms

of the block maxima D(j, k) over all blocks at a ﬁxed scale j, i.e.

Y (j) =

bj
(cid:88)

k=1

log2D(j, k)

(3)

The function Y (j) is called the Max Spectrum of the data. Stoev et al. (2006) established an important result: The
Max Spectrum for time series with suﬃciently large j scales can be expressed as

Y (j) (cid:39)

j
α

+ C

(4)

where C is a constant and α > 0. The tail of the data distribution follows a power law with exponent -α. The
exponent α is called the power tail exponent, which allows us to characterize what kind of distribution is related to the
time series. In general, under the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) theory, some distributions are obtained depending
on location and a scale parameter. One of them is called the Fr´echet distribution. In general, this distribution shows
a right-side tail that decays like a power law (McNeil et al. 2005; McNeil et al. 1997; Hsing 1988; Leadbetter et al.
1983). Ruzmaikin et al. (2011) have shown that fast solar CMEs can be described as a Fr´echet distribution. In this
paper, we are interested in the Fr´echet distribution and parameters describing the clustering of the fast CMEs that
occurred during solar cycles 23 and 24.

Eq. 4 is valid for statistically independent events. If we have dependent data with the same distribution function

(Stoev et al. 2006), then, Eq. 4 can be transformed into

Y (j) (cid:39)

j
α

+ C + log2 (θ) /α

(5)

where C is a constant, θ is called “the extremal index”which takes values in the interval [0, 1] (Leadbetter et al.
1983). Values of θ close to 0 indicate a strong dependence and the possibility to form clusters, while values close to 1
show weak dependence indicating individual independent events. Note, this index characterizes only the dependence
of the extremes in the time series data (Hamidieh et al. 2010).

Eqs. 4 and 5 suggest a method of estimating α and θ (Hamidieh et al. 2010; Stoev et al. 2006). The power tail
exponent α is obtained on the self-similar range of the Max Spectrum Y (j). This range can be related to the self-similar
cascade process in turbulence (Ruzmaikin et al. 2011; Frisch 1995). Similarly, here we check the self-similar interval
to obtain the slope of the line ﬁtted and obtain the power tail exponent α. The inverse exponent 1/α is obtained as a
slope of the line ﬁtted to the Max Spectrum of the data in the self-similar range (Ruzmaikin et al. 2011; Stoev et al.
2006). The process to select the self-similar range is fundamental to obtain the power tail exponent and it inﬂuences
the extremal index θ and the cluster number. In general, diﬀerent intervals were checked on the self-similar range to
obtain the slope and the power tail exponent (α). The best line ﬁtted and their corresponding correlation coeﬃcient
guides the choice of this interval. The Max Spectrum Y (j) and the power tail exponent α are key parameters in the
estimation of the extremal index θ.

The extremal index (θ) deﬁnes the number of independent clusters and provides an estimate of the cluster size given
as (1/θ) (Leadbetter et al. 1983). To calculate the extremal index θ, the original data is ﬁrst randomly permuted.
The new data series (v∗
i ) is obtained in the interval 1 ≤ i ≤ N , and has the same distribution function as the original
data. The randomization destroys the dependence structure of the data, resulting in an approximately independent
sample (Hamidieh et al. 2010). The new Max Spectrum Y (j)∗ is related to the data series randomly permuted, and
satisﬁes Eq. 4, which means the tail of the new data distribution follows a power law with exponent -α. Since the Max
Spectrum of the original data Y (j) satisﬁes Eq. 5 with the same constant C, the diﬀerence between the two spectra
yields an estimate of the extremal index

θ = 2−α(Y (j)∗−Y (j))

(6)

where α is the ﬁtting parameter in the power tail exponent obtained from the Max Spectrum Y (j). Then, we calculate
the diﬀerences of Y (j)∗ − Y (j) and compute the mean for positive diﬀerences to obtain an estimate of the extremal
index θ at each scale j. This procedure is repeated 100 times and 100 θ(j) values are calculated to produce a sequence

6

Rodr´ıguez G´omez et al.

of θ(j) boxplots for each scale j. We obtain an empirical 95% conﬁdence interval, based on 0.025th and 0.975th
empirical quantiles of θ(j) from the histogram of θ values. In practice, Hamidieh et al. (2010) recommend selecting
the middle range of scales for θ estimation. At large scales j (larger block sizes) the bias is lower and the number of
block-maxima is reduced. At lower scales j (smaller block sizes) the bias grows.

We developed a code to calculate the Max Spectrum and extremal index θ. The performance of these esti-
mations is examined carefully. We compared our results with the code2 of Stoev et al. (2006) and the results
presented in Ruzmaikin et al. (2011) for the years 1999 to 2006. Additionally, we examined our code using the
Max-AutoRegressive model of order one (Max-AR(1)) to obtain the extremal index θ. We use the Max-AR(1) series
as [y] = max ar(b, a, iter, N ), with the length of time series N = 215, number of iteration iter = 1, and the parameters
a = 0.7, b = 1.5. Our results are in agreement with the results based on the Stoev’s code.

3.2. De-clustering threshold time τc

In addition, to derive a more detailed characterization of the cluster properties and how they change over diﬀerent
phases of a solar cycle, we use the de-clustering threshold time method. The main idea is to identify clusters in the
time series of CME with speed v ≥ 1000 km/s. The mean time interval between CMEs within a cluster depends on
the speed threshold (v). In our case, we choose CME speeds v ≥ 1000 km/s to characterize extreme events. The
extremal index provides an estimate of the number of clusters (m × θ), where m is the number of extreme events within
a given time interval, e.g. m CMEs with speeds exceeding a threshold v occur during this interval. These CMEs are
on average grouped into a cluster. The de-clustering threshold time τc concept is useful to group CMEs into clusters.
Consider the time intervals τi between consecutive fast CMEs. If the time interval between two fast CMEs is less than
τc, then these CMEs can be grouped into a cluster (Ruzmaikin et al. 2011; Beirlant et al. 2004; Ferro & Segers 2003;
Smith 1989).

To determine the de-clustering threshold time τc, we use the Probability Density Function (PDF) of time intervals
τi between consecutive fast CMEs and the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. τc was deﬁned as the
maximum (σ) value of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution of time intervals (τi) between consecutive
fast CMEs. Figure 3 shows the Probability Density Function (PDF) of time intervals τi between consecutive fast
CMEs (v ≥ 1000 km/s) and the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution (red line) at each period of the solar
cycle. The de-clustering threshold time during the whole interval (solar cycles 23 and 24) is τc ≤ 28.0 ± 1.4 hrs (Figure
3, panel (a)). Applying the method separately to the diﬀerent phase of the solar cycle, we ﬁnd τc ≤ 28.2 ± 2.0 hrs for
the maximum of cycle 23, τc ≤ 32.0 ± 3.6 hrs for the maximum of cycle 24, and τc ≤ 32.5 ± 17.5 hrs for the minimum
phase between cycles 23 and 24 (Figure 3, panels b-d).

4. CLUSTERING OF THE OBSERVED FAST CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS

Here we apply the methodology described in Section 3 to fast CMEs listed in the LASCO CDAW catalog. The Max
Spectrum Y (j) within the self-similar range is used to obtain the power tail exponent (α). In the Max Spectrum plots,
the log2 units along the y-axis are converted to km/s, using 2Y (j) and the scales j on the x-axis are converted into
time units using 2j. See the top panel in ﬁgures 4 - 7, which show the results for diﬀerent periods during solar cycles
23 and 24. We obtained a set of boxplots with θ values (middle panel ﬁgures 4 - 7). The central mark in boxplots is
the median, the box edges are the 10th and 90th percentiles and whiskers extend to the most extreme data points.
Additionally, we built a histogram with the θ values and we calculate an empirical 95% conﬁdence interval, based on
0.025th and 0.975th empirical quantiles in each histogram (vertical dotted lines in the bottom panel Figures 4 - 7).
This procedure allows us to obtain an interval of the extremal index θ values as well as to obtain an estimate of the
predominant cluster size (1/θ).

In Sect. 4.1 we present the analysis applied to the whole time period under study, i.e. from January 1996 to March
2018. However, the CME occurrence rate and speeds vary over the solar cycle (see Figure 1). To take this variability
into account, in Sects. 4.2 - 4.4, we apply the same method for diﬀerent sub-periods to study the variations of the CME
clustering over diﬀerent solar cycle phases. In particular, we select three periods each covering 4-years, representative
of the maximum phase of cycles 23 and 24 as well as the minimum between cycles 23 and 24, as marked in the Figure
1.

4.1. Full period 1996 - 2018

The full interval covers the time range from January 1996 to March 2018, i.e.

it covers almost entirely cycles 23
and 24. During this period the length of the hourly CME speed time series is N = 193944 and the number of scales is
j = log2(N ). Thus, we have j = 17 available scales to apply the Max Spectrum method. Our best ﬁt to the slope gives
evidence that the cumulative distribution function of the CMEs speeds has a Fr´echet type power law tail, with a power
law exponent α = 3.5 (Figure 4 (top)). Boxplots of the extremal index (θ) in the scales related to the self-similar range
are from 644 km/s to 1753 km/s (Figure 4 (middle)). The 0.025th and 0.975th empirical quantiles of the histogram
of the θ boxplots (Figure 4, bottom) allow us to obtain an estimate of the extremal index θ, which shows values from
0.36 to 0.66 within the 95% conﬁdence interval, with a mean of θ = 0.43. The corresponding cluster size is 1/θ ≈ 2 to
3, which means that in the whole time period CMEs with speeds higher than 644 km/s occur preferentially in groups
of two or three.

When selecting CMEs with speeds v ≥ 1000 km/s we obtain m = 913 extreme events, with θ ≈ 0.36 to 0.66 and the
estimated number of clusters is θ × m ≈ 328 to 603, with a de-clustering threshold time τc = 28.0 hrs as derived from
the maximum of the GEV ﬁt (Figure 3). Table 1 summarizes the derived information on the cluster size, mean cluster
duration, mean time between successive CMEs and an estimate of the probabilities that a cluster of the corresponding
size is recorded, using the de-clustering threshold time (τc) method. The cluster duration was calculated as the time
diﬀerence ∆t between the end and the start of the cluster, with the start time of the cluster being deﬁned as the ﬁrst

appearance of the ﬁrst CME of the cluster in the LASCO C2 FOV, and the end time deﬁned as the ﬁrst appearance of
the last CME in the cluster in the LASCO C2 FOV. In general, we ﬁnd that about half of the events (49.2%) occur as
individual events, but CMEs in clusters with two and three members are also prominent, with a percentage of 18.4%
and 12.5% respectively. However, also CMEs that occur in clusters with 4, 5, 6 and 7 members exist on a signiﬁcant
percentage, between about 3 and 7%. The probability of recording a cluster consisting of one (isolated) fast CME is
0.742. The probability of recording a cluster with 2 or 3 fast CMEs within the de-clustering threshold time τc ≤ 28 hrs
is 0.140 and 0.063. These probabilities describe the occurrence of a fast CME followed by one or two more fast CMEs.
Finally, clusters with ≥4 members show a probability smaller than 0.055, see Table 1.

In the following, we apply the same type of analysis separately to three sub-intervals, each of lengths 4 years, that

characterize the maximum of cycles 23 and 24 and the minimum between then two cycles.

4.2. Maximum of solar cycle 23

To study the cluster behavior during the solar maximum of solar cycle 23, we select the data for the time range
from February 1999 to February 2003. The length of this time series is 35736 and j = 15 scales are available in this
interval. We ﬁnd the Max Spectrum is self-similar in a range from 802 km/s to 1484 km/s and the power tail exponent
α = 2.8 (Figure 5 (top)). The extremal index θ ranges from 0.49 to 0.91, within the empirical 95% conﬁdence interval
(middle and bottom panels ﬁgure 5) with a mean value of 0.73, corresponding to a cluster size of 1/θ ≈ 1 to 2. In this
period, we have m = 377 extreme events with v ≥ 1000 km/s. Using the extremal index values θ ≈ 0.49 to 0.91, we
obtain an estimated for the number of clusters θ × m ≈ 185 to 343. For the de-clustering threshold time, we obtain
τc ≤ 28.2 ± 2.0 hrs (Figure 3 panel (b)).

Table 2 summarizes the CME clustering during the maximum of solar cycle 23, using the de-clustering threshold
time description. 47.2% of CMEs occur as individual events. However, there are also signiﬁcant numbers of events that
occur in clusters of two (18.6%), three (15.1%) and four (8.5%) members. The probability of recording an isolated fast

To characterize the clustering properties of fast CMEs, during the maximum phase of cycle 24, we select the data
set from June 2011 to June 2015. The length of the time series is 35688 and j = 15 scales are available in this interval.
The Max Spectrum is self-similar in a range from 974 km/s and 1467 km/s and the power tail exponent is α = 2.8
(Figure 6). The extremal index θ show values from 0.64 to 0.96, with a mean value of 0.77. The predominant cluster
sizes have values from 1 to 2. We obtain m = 225 extreme events in this time interval. Using the extremal index
values, the estimated cluster number θ × m ≈ 144 to 216. The de-clustering threshold time is τc ≤ 32.0 ± 3.6 hrs
(Figure 3 panel (c)).

and four (9.0%) members show a considerable percentage during the maximum of solar cycle 24. The probability
of recording an isolated fast CME is 0.742. The probability of recording a cluster of 2 or 3 fast CMEs within the
de-clustering threshold time τc ≤ 32 hrs is 0.158 and 0.063, respectively. The probability of larger clusters with ≥ 4
members is 0.037.

4.4. Solar minimum

We selected the interval from March 2006 to March 2010 to investigate the cluster behavior during a solar minimum.
The length of this time series is 35712, i.e. there are j = 15 scales in this time period. The Max Spectrum method
shows a self-similar range from 519 km/s to 880 km/s and a power tail exponent α = 2.7 (Figure 7 a). The extremal
index θ show values from about 0.56 to 0.79 (Figure 7 b-c) with a mean value of 0.71 and the cluster size is 1/θ ≈ 1
to 2. In this period, we ﬁnd m = 21 extreme events with CME speed v ≥ 1000 km/s. Using the extremal index
values, we estimate the number of clusters as θ × m ≈ 10 to 16. In this interval, the de-clustering threshold time
is τc ≤ 32.5 ± 17.5 hrs (Figure 3 panel d). During this minimum period, fast CMEs occur preferentially as isolated
events (61.9%). In this phase, only two CME clusters occurred, one with 2 members and interestingly also a large one
with 6 members. The probability of recording an isolated fast CME is 0.866. The probability of recording a cluster of
2 or more fast CMEs within the de-clustering threshold time τc ≤ 32 hrs is 0.067.

4.5. Summary of CME cluster behavior and illustrative examples

Figure 8 shows the distribution of cluster sizes, the number of CMEs in clusters and the cluster duration of fast
CMEs (v ≥ 1000 km/s) for the diﬀerent periods studied (Tables 1 - 4). A summary of the main cluster properties of
the diﬀerent periods is given in Table 5. In all periods, we ﬁnd that the predominant occurrence is as isolated events.
The fraction of isolated events is about 50% during the overall period as well as during the maximum phases of the
solar cycles, whereas it is as high as 62% during solar minimum. During the full period and the maximum phases also
a signiﬁcant fraction of clusters with 2 and 3 members occur, with a percentage of 22% and 15%, respectively. Clusters
with ≥ 4 members cover in total 20%. In contrast, in solar minimum, only two clusters occur, all other CMEs are
isolated events. This is in agreement with the results from the Max Spectrum method. However, also larger clusters
with more than 4 members (up to 10) exist, and include in total about 20% of all CMEs. The mean durations of the
clusters during whole period are 13.5 hrs for clusters consisting of 2 CMEs, 28.4 hrs for clusters of size 3, 39.2 hrs for
clusters of size 4, and may be as long as 133.7 hrs for the largest cluster consisting of 10 CMEs.

For the de-clustering times derived from the maximum of the GEV ﬁt to the distributions of the time diﬀerences
between successive fast CMEs, we ﬁnd values in the range τc = 28 − 32 hrs for the diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle.
This is an interesting result. Although the occurrence of CMEs is much less during solar minimum periods than in
solar maximum, this does not aﬀect the basic clustering time scales. The CME de-clustering times are very similar
during the diﬀerent phase of the solar cycle.

In the following we show for illustration some examples of the clusters we identiﬁed, using white-light coronagraph
images from LASCO C2. Figure 9 shows a cluster with two members and a time diﬀerence between the successive
CMEs τi = 16.8 hrs that occurred on 2017-09-09 at 23:12:12 and 2017-09-10 at 16:00:07 (Figure 9). During 2017-09-09
to 2017-09-10, AR 12673 produced a cluster with 2 fast CMEs, the ﬁrst one has a speed of v = 1148 km/s and is
followed after about 17 hrs by another very fast CME with v = 3703 km/s. Note that AR 12673 was the source of
the two largest ﬂare/CME events of solar cycle 24, i.e. the X9.3 ﬂare on 2017 September 6 and the X8.2 ﬂare on 2017
September 10, which is associated with the second CME of the cluster described here (e.g. Veronig et al. (2018)). The

CME-CME interaction of the two fast CMEs of this cluster and their space weather eﬀects is studied in detail in Guo
et al. (2018).

and mean time diﬀerence between the successive CMEs of τi = 18.7 hrs. Figure 11 shows one widely studied case of
homologous CMEs that occurred in the time period 23 to 25 November 2000 (Nitta & Hudson 2001; Lugaz et al. 2017),
which is related to a cluster detected with six members. This cluster starts on 2000-11-23 at 21:30:08 to 2000-11-25 at
01:31:58 with the speeds of the CME in the cluster ranging from 1002 to 2528 km/s and mean time between successive
CMEs τi = 5.6 hrs.

5. GEO-EFFECTIVENESS OF CME CLUSTERS

Clustering CMEs

15

In this section, we study the relationship between clusters of fast CMEs and their potential geo-eﬀectiveness by
evaluating the geomagnetic Disturbance storm time (Dst) index using the available data of the World Data Center for
Geomagnetism, Kyoto3, from April 1998 to December 2014. The main idea is to check statistically whether fast CMEs
that occur in clusters are more geo-eﬀective than fast CMEs that occur isolated. For CMEs with speed of 1000 km/s
in the SOHO/LASCO FOV (∼ 2 − 30R(cid:12)) a large spread of travel times to 1 AU from ∼ 20 to ∼ 80 hrs was found
in observations and in drag-based modeling (Vrˇsnak et al. 2013; Schwenn et al. 2005). Geomagnetic-storms depend
on the arriving ICME speed as well as on the strength and structure of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (Gonzalez
& Tsurutani 1987; Wilson 1987; Russell 2000). In IP space, the magnetic driving forces are usually assumed to have
ceased, and the MHD drag force due to the interaction between the solar wind and ICME to be important, which
would tend to accelerate slow CMEs (i.e. slower than the ambient solar wind) and to decelerate fast CMEs (Temmer
& Nitta 2015; Vrˇsnak et al. 2013; Temmer et al. 2011; Cargill 2004). However, there are also other eﬀects in IP space
that are relevant to consider, in particular preceding and interacting CMEs/ICMEs, that also have a strong eﬀect on
the propagation behavior (Scolini et al. 2020; Temmer & Nitta 2015; Farrugia et al. 2011; Farrugia & Berdichevsky
2004; Burlaga 1995). Further, there exist also cases of very fast CMEs, which showed only a little deceleration in
IP space (Winslow et al. 2015; Russell et al. 2013; Temmer et al. 2011; Vandas et al. 2009; Berdichevsky et al. 2002;
Zastenker et al. 1976). During the maximum of solar cycle 24, it was better appreciated that fast CMEs can occur
in quick succession (Liu et al. 2014a,b; Temmer et al. 2014; Gopalswamy et al. 2013; M¨ostl et al. 2012; Lugaz et al.
2012). This close succession is described through the de-clustering threshold time τc. As a result, the possibility of
ICMEs interacting in the inner heliosphere signiﬁcantly increases. ICME-ICME interactions are important because
they aﬀect their interplanetary propagation and evolution (Luhmann et al. (2020) and references therein). Therefore,
we used a statistical description of the clustering of fast CMEs to evaluate their potential geo-eﬀectiveness.

Based on these ﬁndings, we deﬁned the corresponding potential geo-eﬀective period as CMEs start + 1 day to cluster
end + 4 days (e.g. assuming Sun-Earth travel times of fast ICMEs from 1 to 4 days). For isolated events, we deﬁned
the potential geo-eﬀective period as the start time of the cluster + 1 day to the start time of the CME + 4 days. We
calculate for each of these periods the total sum of the hourly Dst values normalized by cluster size as well as the
negative Dst peak (Dst minimum).

bottom: individual events, clusters with 2 and ≥ 3 members. The ﬁrst column corresponds to values of the total hourly sum of
Dst per cluster size and the second column corresponds to the minimum value of Dst.

Rodr´ıguez G´omez et al.

We note that this is a rough and statistical approach. Obviously, not for all fast CMEs, we are studying here, the
corresponding interplanetary manifestations ICMEs will be reaching the Earth (the sample also includes back-sided
events). Also, it is clear that at times where we have a high occurrence rate of fast CMEs, there will on average be
a higher geomagnetic activity as, e.g., evidenced by the Dst index. Thus we look at two speciﬁc quantities, with the
following hypothesis behind. We calculate the total hourly Dst summed over the time interval where the corresponding
fast CMEs of a cluster might be reaching Earth, but divide it by the number of CMEs in the cluster. This gives us
a statistical description of the geo-eﬀectivity per CME, and to check whether this is diﬀerent for isolated events than
for CMEs occurring in clusters. Second, we also check the minimum Dst value in the given potential ”geo-eﬀective
interval”. Assuming that CMEs that occur in clusters might be merging in interplanetary space, they can arrive as
one merged CME that causes one bigger storm (e.g. review by Lugaz et al. (2017)).

Figure 12 shows the potential geo-eﬀectivity for isolated CMEs and for CMEs in clusters of size 2 and ≥ 3 during
the time range April 1998 to December 2014. The ﬁrst column shows the distribution of the total hourly sum of
Dst/cluster size and the second column the minimum values of Dst index in the geo-eﬀectivity period. For the total
Dst/cluster size, we ﬁnd some change in the bulk of the distribution toward higher values from isolated CMEs to
clusters of size 2. However, the largest numbers are associated with isolated events. This is diﬀerent when we look into
the distribution of the minimum Dst values, which show a change to larger negative peak values for CMEs in clusters
than in isolated events. This is also reﬂected in a change of the mean values of the distribution (−51.7 nT for isolated
events, −67.3 nT for clusters of 2 members, and −88.7 nT for clusters ≥ 3). Additionally, we calculate the fraction of
minimum values of Dst ≤ −100 nT for isolated events, clusters with two and ≥ 3 members. For isolated events the
fraction correspond to 10%, clusters with two members is 18% and clusters with more members correspond to 26%.
These ﬁndings provide indications that the geo-eﬀectivity per CME is higher in CMEs that occur in clusters than in
isolated CMEs.

6. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Two methods were applied to obtain a statistical description of the occurrence and clustering properties of fast CMEs
(v ≥ 1000 km/s) during the solar cycles 23 and 24. These are the Max Spectrum and the de-clustering threshold
time method. The analysis was performed for the whole interval 1996-2018 that covers almost two full solar cycles, as
well as separately for 4-year subperiods centered at the maximum of cycles 23 and 24 as well as on the minimum in
between. The main results we found are the following.

• In all phases of the solar cycle, we ﬁnd that isolated events make the largest fraction of the temporal distribution
of fast CMEs. However, there are distinct diﬀerences between the maximum and minimum solar cycle phases.
In the maximum phases of solar cycles 23 (24), about 47% (52%) are isolated events, whereas it is 62% in the
minimum period between cycles 23 and 24. During the total period studied, about 50% of CMEs occur as isolated
events, 18% (12%) occur in clusters of size 2 (3), and another 20% in larger clusters ≥ 4.

• From the Max Spectrum, we ﬁnd in all cases that the speeds of fast CMEs show have a Fr´echet type distribution,
following a power law with a power tail exponent α ≈ 3.0. During the maximum of solar cycles 23 and 24, the
power tail exponent α has values from 2.7 to 2.8. However, when we checked the whole period, we obtain a value
α = 3.5. This diﬀerence is most probably related to the decreasing and rising phases of each solar cycle.

• The Max Spectrum method provides an estimate of the extremal index (θ), which gives information about the
cluster size. During the whole period covering solar cycles 23 and 24, the extremal index θ has values from 0.3 to
0.6. This suggests an average cluster size from 2 to 3. These ﬁndings are in agreement with the results obtained
in Ruzmaikin et al. (2011) for the period from January 1999 to December 2006.

• The de-clustering threshold time method depends on the speed threshold and is purely empirical. Using the
time series of fast CMEs, we deﬁne a threshold v ≥ 1000 km/s to characterize extreme events. The de-clustering
threshold time method conﬁrms the results obtained from the Max Spectrum method, i.e. that fast CMEs show
a tendency to occur in clusters. However, while the Max Spectrum method has the capability to detect the
predominant clusters, the de-clustering threshold time method allows us to obtain more detailed information on
the clustering properties, i.e. how the CMEs are distributed over clusters of diﬀerent sizes and what are the
typical time scales of the clustering.

Clustering CMEs

17

• Through the de-clustering threshold time method, we obtained an estimate of the typical time scales (τc) between
successive fast CMEs. For the entire period and during the maximum of solar cycle 23 the time between successive
fast CMEs is τc ≤ 28 hrs, while for the maximum of solar cycle 24 and the solar minimum τc ≤ 32 hrs. It
is interesting to note that the de-clustering times obtained are very similar in all phases with τc in the range
28 − 32 hrs, although the occurrence rate of fast CMEs is very diﬀerent in diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle.
These ﬁndings suggest that the τc values obtained for fast CMEs may be representative of the characteristic
energy build-up time of ARs between the release of successive large events.

• The mean duration of clusters with two members is 13 hrs, for clusters with three members it is between
22 − 30 hrs and for clusters with four members it is between 31 − 39 hrs. The largest clusters identiﬁed, i.e with
10 members reach durations up to 134 hrs.

• During the full interval studied as well as during the maximum phases of solar cycle 23 and 24, the probabilities
that a cluster of the corresponding size is recorded can give us clues about the clustering properties of fast CMEs
and their impact in the space weather context. For the overall period studied, we ﬁnd that the probability of
recording a cluster of one (isolated) fast CME is 0.742. The probability of recording a cluster consisting of 2,
3 or ≥4 fast CMEs within the de-clustering threshold time τc ≤ 28 hrs is 0.140, 0.063 and 0.055, respectively.
These probabilities describe the occurrence of a fast CME followed by one, two or more fast CMEs within the
de-clustering time.

• The potential geo-eﬀectivity in isolated events and clusters statistically quantiﬁed by the total hourly sum of Dst
normalized by cluster size shows some change in the bulk of the distribution toward higher values from isolated
CMEs to clusters of size 2. However, the largest values are associated with isolated events. On the other hand,
the distribution of the Dst minima values show a distinct change (the mean values change from −51.7 nT for
isolated events, −67.3 nT for clusters of 2 members, and −88.7 nT for clusters ≥ 3). Also, we ﬁnd that the
fraction of associated large geomagnetic storms as quantiﬁed by minimum values of Dst < −100 nT is increasing
with cluster size: it is 10% for isolated events, 18% for clusters of size 2, and 26% for clusters of size ≥ 3. These
ﬁndings indicate that clustering of fast CMEs is not necessarily making the overall geo-eﬀectivity higher during
the given period compared to the same number of CMEs occurring isolated, but that statistically fast CMEs
that occur in close successions in clusters have a tendency to produce larger storms than isolated events. This
could be due to the interaction of the CMEs in interplanetary space and their arrival as one complex entity at
Earth that causes larger geo-eﬀectivity Lugaz et al. (2017).

Our results of typical de-clustering time scales of fast CMEs (v ≥ 1000 km/s) in the range of τc = 28 − 32 hrs
are in basic agreement with the deﬁnition of quasi-homologous CMEs as successive CMEs originating from the same
AR with a separation by ∼ 15 − 18 hrs (Lugaz et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2013). The relevant time scales in fast CME
occurrence is described by τc. These values are relevant for CME interaction, for magnetosphere preconditioning as
well as for comparison with relaxation time scales/duration of geomagnetic storms. The interactions in the heliosphere
play an important role in Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) production and strong geomagnetic eﬀects, e.g. statistical
studies showed that the presence of a previous fast CMEs within 12 hrs increases the probability that this second
fast CME contributes to SEP production (Lugaz et al. 2017; Farrugia et al. 2006; Yashiro et al. 2004; Berdichevsky
et al. 2003; Gopalswamy et al. 2002). These ﬁndings emphasize the crucial importance of ICME-ICME interactions
for space weather (Liu et al. 2015, 2014b).

The fact that the geo-eﬀectivity per CME is higher when the fast CMEs occur in clusters than when they occur as

isolated events, may be related to diﬀerent aspects:

a) That CMEs in clusters have a higher probability to interact, and that interacting CMEs have a tendency to be

more geo-eﬀective (Riley & Love 2017; Liu et al. 2014b).

b) That the occurrence of multiple CMEs along with the Sun-Earth line preconditions interplanetary space, e.g.
reducing the interplanetary density along the paths of a following fast CME, which reduces the drag force exerted
on it, (e.g. Temmer & Nitta (2015); Liu et al. (2014b)).

c) That the subsequent disturbance of the Earth magnetosphere within short times may lead to diﬀerently strong
eﬀects, in the form of preconditioning of the magnetosphere under repeated strong energy input by the arrival

18

of fast CMEs. These large perturbations induced by consecutive CMEs (clusters) in the coupled magnetosphere-
ionosphere system causes a higher geo-eﬀectiveness. The strongly varying ﬁeld and plasma density in the sheath
region preceding the ICME, the fast solar wind speed, as well as the interplanetary shock itself are all eﬀective
drivers of geomagnetic activity (Vennerstrom et al. 2012; Pulkkinen 2007; Farrugia et al. 1997).

An extreme space weather event caused by preconditioning of the upstream solar wind by an earlier CME, in-transit
interaction between subsequent fast CMEs in close succession as well as their typical time scales, can give clues what
are the main ingredients for the most extreme space weather events and how to obtain a better forecast of these
combined conditions.
