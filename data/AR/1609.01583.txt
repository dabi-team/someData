Pairwise additive potentials for multielectronic atoms interacting with a LiF(001) surface are
revisited by including an improved description of the electron density associated with the diﬀerent
lattice sites, as well as non-local electron density contributions. Within this model, the electron
distribution around each ionic site of the crystal is described by means of an onion approach that
accounts for the inﬂuence of the Madelung potential. From such densities, binary interatomic
potentials are then derived by using well-known non-local functionals for the kinetic, exchange
and correlation terms. Rumpling and long-range contributions due to projectile polarization and
van der Waals forces are also included in an analogous fashion. We apply this pairwise additive
approximation to evaluate the interaction potential between closed-shell - He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe
- and open-shell
- N, S, and Cl - atoms and the LiF surface, analyzing the relative importance of
the diﬀerent contributions. The performance of the proposed potentials is assessed by contrasting
angular positions of rainbow and supernumerary rainbow maxima produced by fast grazing incidence
with available experimental data. The good agreement found for normal energies in the eV- range
represents a meaningful evidence of the quality of the present description.

INTRODUCTION

In the ﬁeld of particle-surface interactions, one of
the most remarkable experimental advances of the last
decade corresponds to the observation of grazing inci-
dence fast atom diﬀraction (GIFAD or FAD) [1, 2], which
has emerged as a powerful surface analysis technique [3–
6]. It allows one to inspect the electronic and morpholog-
ical characteristics of crystal surfaces with an exceptional
sensitivity, becoming a useful tool for investigating a wide
variety of materials [7–10].

The accuracy of the surface information provided by
the FAD method crucially relies on the theoretical model
used to describe the surface potential.
In previous ar-
ticles [11–13] we investigated the FAD process for dif-
ferent atoms impinging on LiF(001) by using a pairwise
additive approach to represent the surface interaction.
Pairwise additive potentials are built as a sum of binary
interatomic potentials that describe the interaction of the
atomic projectile with individual ionic centers of the crys-
tal. For insulator materials, like LiF, where the electron
density is highly localized around the atomic nuclei, this
simple potential model has shown to represent a reliable
alternative to more complex self-consistent ab-initio cal-
culations [12–16]. However, in most works the binary
potentials are derived by using the Local Density Ap-
proximation (LDA) to evaluate the kinetic and exchange
terms [17]. But the LDA does not include contributions
due to non-local electron density terms, which might play
an important role, especially for open-shell projectiles,
with partially occupied outer shells.

In Ref. [18] an attempt to include the proper asymp-
totic limit of the binary interatomic potentials was done
for the case of multielectronic atoms grazingly scattered

oﬀ a LiF(001) surface. In this article we revisit such pair-
wise additive model by incorporating non-local contribu-
tions of the electron density, together with the improve-
ment of the description of the electron density associated
with each ionic center of the insulator.

The interaction between rare gases (closed-shell atoms)
- He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe - with fully occupied valence
shells, as well as open-shell atoms - N, S, and Cl - with
vacancies in the outer level, and a LiF(001) surface is
studied. In all the cases, the kinetic, exchange and corre-
lation terms of the binary potentials are evaluated from
well established non-local functionals, which depend on
ﬁrst- and second- order derivatives of the electron den-
sity. The electron density corresponding to each ionic
center of the LiF crystal is obtained from an onion model
that takes into account the inﬂuence of the whole crys-
tal lattice, i.e., the Madelung potential [19]. Long-range
contributions associated with polarization and van der
Waals (vdW) forces, produced by the rearrangement of
the atom and surface densities as a result of the mutual
interaction, are determined within a similar pairwise ad-
ditive scheme. Furthermore, a surface rumpling with a
displacement distance extracted from ab-initio calcula-
tions [20] is considered.

With the aim of testing the proposed potential model,
we use it to evaluate angular distributions of fast atoms
grazingly scattered from the LiF surface along low-
indexed crystallographic channels. The elastic collision
process is described within the surface initial-value repre-
sentation (SIVR) approximation [21–23], which is a semi-
quantum method that oﬀers a very good representation
of the diﬀraction spectra, without requiring the use of
convolutions to smooth the theoretical curves [24]. The
validity of the surface potential model is examined by

 
 
 
 
 
 
comparing the angular positions of rainbow and super-
numerary rainbow maxima with available experimental
data. The rainbow peak corresponds to the outermost
maximum of the projectile distribution, which has a clas-
sical origin, while supernumerary rainbows are associated
with FAD, being produced by quantum interference in-
side the channel. These deﬂection angles are extremely
sensitive to the corrugation of the surface potential across
the incidence direction, resulting a useful magnitude to
probe surface interactions.

The article is organized as follows. The constituent
parts of the binary interatomic potentials are summa-
rized in Sec. II. In this section we also show the short-
range binary potentials for the diﬀerent atomic projec-
tiles - He, N, Ne, S, Ar, Cl, Kr and Xe - interacting with
LiF(001), examining their asymptotic limits. In Sec. III
we derive the corresponding total atom-surface poten-
tials, including projectile polarization and vdW contri-
IV, angular positions of rainbow and
butions.
supernumerary rainbow maxima produced by projectile
incidence along the (cid:104)110(cid:105) and (cid:104)100(cid:105) channels of the LiF
crystal are compared with experimental data in order to
illustrate the soundness of the potential model. In such
a comparison, normal energies, associated with the pro-
jectile motion perpendicular to the axial channel, in the
range from 0.2 to 80 eV are considered. In Sec. V we
outline our conclusions. Atomic units (e2 = (cid:126) = me = 1)
are used unless otherwise stated.

In Sec.

II. BINARY INTERACTION MODEL

Within a pairwise additive scheme, the interaction be-
tween an impinging atom and an ionic crystal surface,
like LiF(001), is described as a sum of binary interatomic
potentials which depend on the electron densities corre-
sponding to the atom and individual ionic centers of the
crystal. In this section we will summarize all steps re-
quired to build our binary interatomic potentials, analyz-
ing separately the asymptotic limits of each contribution.

A.

Ionic centers of the crystal: Onions

With the purpose of determining the electron density
corresponding to each ionic center of the LiF crystal, let
us consider a perfect cubic piece of crystal centered on an
active ﬂuor ion. For this F− anion, immersed in the LiF
crystal, the corresponding multielectronic wave function
ΨF can be obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger equation
associated with the Hamiltonian

the active F− ion. In Eqs. (6) and (11) of Ref. [19] V +

was approximated by a radial onion potential produced
by a series of charged shells. But these discrete charged
layers introduce structures in the potential, which are
diﬃcult to handle. Therefore, in this work we ﬁt the pre-
vious grid potential [19] by means of a smooth potential,
here named Madelung potential, deﬁned as

λ is chosen to verify that the spacial integral of V +
M (r)
in the range (0, +∞) coincides with the one of the grid
potential of Ref. [19], ﬁnding λ (cid:39) 0.3 a/2 , with a = 7.60

M (r) is plotted along with the grid potential of Ref.
[19]. Notice that V +
M (r) yields the correct asymptotic
limit at long distances, i.e., V +
M (r) → −1/r as r → +∞,
reproducing the Coulomb potential originated by an uni-
tary charge which renders the Coulomb hole that the
electron leaves behind when it is removed.

In a similar way, the two-electron wave function ΨLi
corresponding to an active Li+ cation, immersed in the
LiF crystal, can be derived within an onion treatment
from the approximate Hamiltonian

For convenience, we call onions to these dressed an-
ion and cation, denoting them as F −
@, respec-
tively. The unperturbed electron density associated with
each individual onion - F −
@ - is obtained from
the square modulus of the corresponding wave function,
ΨF or ΨLi, respectively. To evaluate the electronic wave
functions ΨF and ΨLi we carried out full Hartree-Fock
(HF) calculations from the Hamiltonians of Eqs.
(1)
(with V +
G ) and (3), respectively, using
the code NRHF by Johnson [26]. The original code was
adapted to incorporate the central potential V ±
M (r) and
a grid of about 103 points was used in the numerical cal-
culation.

Binding energies and mean radii derived from the elec-
tronic wave functions ΨF and ΨLi are tabulated in Table
I. From this table, the binding energy of the F −
@ (2p)
is about −15 eV (−0.553 a.u.), agreeing fairly well with
the experimental ﬁnding of (−13 ±0.3) eV for the cen-
ter of the surface valence band, measured with respect

to the vacuum level [27] . Also the ionization energies of
F −
@ (2s) and Li+
@(1s) are near to the experimental values
[28], while the ionization energy of the inner state F −
@ (1s)
is very close to the value obtained as the energy of the
isolated F−(1s) [29] minus VM 0.

B. Binary interatomic potentials

@ or O = Li+

Making use of the electron densities derived within the
onion model (Sec. II A), in this subsection we calculate
the binary interatomic potential between an onion O of
the crystal surface, with O = F −
@, and the
impinging atom A, as a function of the internuclear sep-
aration R. This binary potential is here split into two
terms: one named short-range that describes the static
interaction between the atomic projectile and the ionic
center O by considering their respective electron distribu-
tions as frozen, and the other, called long-range, which
takes into account the rearrangement of their electron
densities as a result of the mutual interaction, but in a
perturbative way.

1. The short-range binary potential

The short-range potential that represents the static
interaction of a neutral atom A, of nuclear charge ZA
and electron density nA = nA(r) [29], with an onion O,
= 3) and
of nuclear charge ZO (ZF −
electron density nO = nO(r), can be approximated as a
sum of four terms [30, 31]:

= 9 and ZLi+

(4)

where R is the internuclear vector and Ve, Vk, Vx, and
Vc are the electrostatic, kinetic, exchange and correlation
potentials, respectively. Due to the spherical symmetry
of the interacting partners, these partial potentials de-
pend only on R = |R|.

As explained in Sec. II A, the electron densities nA and
nO are here obtained from full HF calculations. Then,
our task is to use them to build the partial potentials
involved in Eq. (4). The ﬁrst term of Eq. (4) represents
the well-known electrostatic interaction, which reads

Ve(R) =

while the remaining terms - Vk, Vx, and Vc - can be de-
rived as [31]:

Vj(R) = Ej [ntot(R)]−Ej [nO]−Ej [nA] ,

for j = k, x, c,
(6)
by assuming that the total electron density of the atom-
onion system at a given internuclear separation R is

3

given by [31]

ntot(R) = nO(r) + nA (r − R) .

(7)

In Eq. (6), the functionals Ej [n] for j = k, x, c represent
the kinetic, exchange and correlation energies, respec-
tively, depending not only on the local electron density
n(r), but also on non-local magnitudes, like the gradient
and the Laplacian of the electron density.

In previous articles [12, 13] we used the spin-restricted
LDA to evaluate Ek and Ex (Ec was neglected). In this
article we do a quality leap by introducing non-local ap-
proximations in terms of ∇n and ∇2n, which allows us
to obtain more accurate values, but without losing the
simplicity of Eq. (6). For the exchange energy, j = x,
we use the well established spin-dependent Becke (B) ap-
proximation given by Eq. (8) of Ref. [32]:

E(B)

(9)

g(r) = |∇rn(r)| /n(r)4/3,

(10)

and cx, β and γ are constants [32]. Accordingly, for the
kinetic term, j = k, we use the Lee-Lee-Parr (LLP) ap-
proach given by Eq.
[33], which can be
(7) of Ref.
considered in a level equivalent to the B exchange ex-
pression since in terms of the Density Functional Theory
it is called ”conjointness”:

For both onions, the kinetic and exchange energies de-
rived with the functionals of Eqs. (11) and (8), respec-
tively, are in better agreement with the corresponding
HF values than the ones obtained from the LDA. Also
the total energies obtained including the correlation term
E(LY P )
are close to the total HF values. In this regard,
it is important to remind that the Virial theorem does
not hold for this case because we are not dealing with a
central Coulomb potential.

Results of our LLPB3LYP approximation for the
short-range binary potentials corresponding to F −

Li+
@ interacting with closed-shell atoms - He, Ne, Ar, Kr,
Xe- are displayed in Fig. 2. In turn, in Fig. 3 we focus on
projectiles having open outer shells - N(4S), S(3P ) and
Cl(2P ) - which are ferromagnetic atoms corresponding
to the so-called unrestricted spin cases. For these latter
projectiles, as well as for He, Ne and Kr, there are exper-
imental data of rainbow and/or FAD maxima available
In Figs. 2 and 3, in order
in the literature [13, 18].

which makes evident the behavior at short and long dis-
tances. At the origin F (short)
(0) = ZAZO, indicating
that the internuclear atom-onion interaction, given by
(5), provides the main contribu-
the ﬁrst term of Eq.
tion to the binary potential V (short)
for small R val-
ues. At large distances, instead, F (short)
(R) tends as
V (short)
(R)2R4, which competes directly with the polar-
AO
izability of the impinging atom αA (see Eqs. (13) and
(14) below). Besides, as in these ﬁgures we are plot-
ting the absolute value of F (short)
(R), its sign must be
indicated: at short distances V (short)
is always positive
due to the static and kinetic contributions, while at large
distances V (short)
is negative as a consequence of the pre-
ponderance of the exchange and correlation energies.

2. The long-range binary potential

By long-range binary potential we mean the poten-
tial produced by the rearrangement of the electron den-
sities of the interacting partners, also known as disper-
sive force, which dominates the long-distance behavior
of the atom-onion interaction. Within a perturbative
treatment, the long- range binary potential for the sys-
tem composed by a target onion O, with O = F −
@ or O =
Li+
@, and an incident neutral atom A can be expanded as
a power series of R, reading [36, 37]:

where R is again the internuclear distance. The coeﬃ-
cient of ﬁrst term of Eq. (13) is expressed as

C (4)

AO =

αA
2

,

(14)

where αA is the static polarizability of the atom A. This
term is associated with the dipole momentum induced on
the projectile by the target onion O, reﬂecting the contri-
bution of the projectile polarization. In Table III we list
the values of the static polarizabilities for the considered
projectiles, as extracted from the bibliography [38, 39].
Furthermore, to compare the contribution of this term
with the asymptotic limit of V (short)
, the αAvalues are
also displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 considering the range
R = 8 − 10 a.u. where the dipolar term results relevant.
It is also interesting to investigate the following term
of the expansion of Eq. (13), which is governed by the
coeﬃcient C (6)
AO related to vdW forces. The value of C (6)
AO
can be estimated by using the formula of Slater-Kirkwood
[40] as

AO =

αAαO
(cid:16)(cid:112)αA/NA + (cid:112)αO/NO

(cid:17) ,

(15)

where αA and αO are the static polarizabilities of the
atom and the onion, respectively, and NA and NO are
the numbers of the corresponding active electrons (i.e.,
the external ones). Both magnitudes are well known for
atomic projectiles: The atomic polarizabilities αA are
given in Table III, while the NA values can be calculated
from the homonuclear coeﬃcients C (6)
AA [39] in the usual
[41]). But for onions the val-
way (see Eq. (2) of Ref.
ues of αO and NO must be speciﬁcally determined as
explained in the Appendix A.

Using the onion values given by Eqs.

(A1) and
(A2), together with the recommended atomic parame-
ters [38, 39], listed in Table III, we obtain the C (6)
AO values
also tabulated in the same table for the diﬀerent atom-
onion systems. For He atoms, our C (6)
AO coeﬃcients are
very close to the ones by Celli et al. [42], obtained by
ﬁtting experiments of helium atoms bound to a LiF sur-
face. Moreover, from the C (6)
AO values of Table III we can
evaluate the vdW contribution to the function

AO (R) = V (long)
F (long)

AO

(R)2R4,

(16)

which reads C (6)
AO2R−2, also shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for
R ≥ 10 a.u. By comparing this contribution with F (short)
and with the projectile polarizability, we are able to esti-
mate that vdW forces aﬀect binary interatomic potentials
only at very long distances, larger than 10 a.u.

AO

Finally, before tackling the evaluation of the total
atom-surface potential, it is interesting to use the same
potential model to address the study of the inter-onion
F −
@ − F −
@ potentials, shown in
Fig. 4 (a). From these potentials we evaluate the total

@ and Li+

@ − Li+

@ − Li+

@ , F −

energy per onion-pair at the bulk [43], which is displayed
in Fig. 4 (b) as a function of the nearest-neighbor onion
distance so. We can see that the curve of Fig. 4 (b)
presents a minimum around so = 3.8 a.u., which is in
very good agreement with the nearest-neighbor distance
corresponding to the real crystal, i.e. so = a/2.

III. TOTAL ATOM-SURFACE POTENTIAL

By using the short- and long- range binary potentials
introduced in Sec. II, we proceed to build the total atom-
surface potential W (RA) for an atom A interacting with
a LiF(001) surface. It reads:

W (RA) = W (short)(RA) + W (long)(RA),

(17)

where RA denotes the position of A with respect to ori-
gin of the frame of reference, placed on a given ionic
center of the topmost atomic layer (in our case, an F −
@ -
site) and W (short) (W (long)) represents the short- (long-)
range contribution to the total atom-surface potential.

The term W (short)(RA) is expressed as the sum of the

binary short-range potentials given by Eq. (4) as:

W (short)(RA) =

(cid:88)

eiV (short)
AOi

(ρi),

(18)

i
where ρi = RA − Ri, with Ri being the position vec-
tor of the onion labeled with index i (Oi), and the fac-
tor ei describes the Evjen caging, that is, ei = 1 except
for onions placed at the limiting surface (ei = 1/2), at
the arista (ei = 1/4) or at the vertex (ei = 1/8) of
the crystal sample. This caging warranties the Coulomb
neutrality of the considered portion of crystal. In all our
calculations, the sum on i includes 11 × 11 × 4 = 484
crystal sites. In addition, we considered a surface rum-
pling with an outward (inward) shift of the positions of
the topmost F −
@) onions, relative to the unre-
constructed surface, of 0.046 a.u., as extracted from the
ab-initio calculation of Ref.
[20]. In Fig. 5 we plot the
short-range potential W (short) for the atoms investigated
in this work, as a function of the normal distance to the
surface, considering a position on top of an F − site.

@ ( Li+

In contrast with the short-range contribution, the long-
range interaction W (long)(RA) cannot be obtained by
simply adding the corresponding binary potentials. The
total long-range potential is here split in two terms:
W (long)(RA) = U (dip)(RA) + U (vdW )(RA),

(19)

where U (dip) and U (vdW ) correspond to the dipole and
vdW contributions, which are associated with the ﬁrst
and second term of Eq. (13), respectively. We stress
that each of these contributions is not pairwise additive.
The dipole potential U (dip)(RA) depends on the total
electric ﬁeld produced by the diﬀerent ionic centers of the
crystal, evaluated at the position of the atom A. It reads

U (dip)(RA) = −

the divergence of this electric ﬁeld at the origin. In this
work the function fi was evaluated taking into account
information about the physics of adatoms, as explained
in the Appendix B. Noteworthily, the projectile polariza-
tion term given by Eq. (20) strongly aﬀects FAD spectra
for incidence along the (cid:104)110(cid:105) channel [11, 13]. But for in-
cidence along the (cid:104)100(cid:105) direction, the alternation of the
opposite eﬀective Coulomb charges of the F −
@ and Li+
@
onions along the channel makes the polarization eﬀect
negligible [11, 13].

In the case of the vdW contribution U (vdW )(RA), for
the sake of simplicity we evaluate it at a position on top
of an F− site; that is, at RA = zA (cid:98)z, where the ver-
sor (cid:98)z is oriented normal to the surface, aiming towards
the vacuum region. In the most simple model, far from
the surface U (vdW )(zA (cid:98)z) can be derived as the super-
position of the binary vdW contributions (second term
of Eq. (13)) produced by a continuous distribution of
onions, reading

(vdW )

In relation to Eq. (22), we must mention that it does
not take into account the fact that the diﬀerent dipoles
induced in the crystal by the projectile interaction screen
values derived
each other [42]. For this reason, D
from Eq.
(23) should be considered as an upper limit
because they are expected to be higher than those ob-
tained from the approach by Lifshitz et al. [44, 45], which
includes the proper screening. Remarkably, we observe
that the z−3
A dependence given by Eq. (22) , which gave
rise to the famous potential V9−3 [45], starts to dominate
at distances farther than 10 a.u. This fact makes the
inﬂuence of U (vdW ) negligible for normal energies higher

than 0.2 eV, like the ones considered in this article, where
closest distances smaller than 5.3 a.u. are reached by the
impinging atoms.

Concerning the importance of the vdW contribution,
we should draw the attention to H projectiles, for which
a completely diﬀerent situation is observed.
In the
case of FAD for H on LiF(001), a non-negligible role of
vdW interactions was recently reported in the low-to-
intermediate normal energy regime [46]. Such a notice-
able vdW eﬀect is compatible with the relatively high

corresponding short-range potentials, obtained within

IV. COMPARISON WITH GRAZING
INCIDENCE EXPERIMENTS

With the goal of checking the quality of the proposed
surface potential we use the potential model within the
framework of the SIVR approximation in order to eval-
uate ﬁnal projectile distributions for swift atoms graz-
ingly impinging on LiF(001) along low-indexed crystallo-
graphic channels. The SIVR approach [21, 22] is a semi-
quantum method that provides a clear representation of
the main physical mechanisms involved in FAD processes,
describing them in terms of classical trajectories through
the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum me-
chanics [47]. It incorporates an adequate description of
classically forbidden transitions on the dark side of the
rainbow angle, providing reliable FAD patterns along the
whole angular range [21, 22].

f + θ2

f ≈ θ2

Under axial incidence conditions [4], like the ones con-
sidered here, the angular distribution of scattered projec-
tiles lays on an annulus given by ϕ2
i , where θf
(θi) is the ﬁnal (initial) polar angle, measured with re-
spect to the surface, and ϕf
is the azimuthal exit angle
measured with respect to the incidence direction in the
surface plane, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The typi-
cal FAD distribution displayed in such an inset presents
maxima symmetrically placed with respect to ϕf = 0,
which are associated with rainbow and supernumerary
rainbow peaks. The outermost maxima of the spectrum
are produced by rainbow scattering, having a classical
explanation, while the inner peaks are related to super-
numerary rainbows, being originated by quantum inter-
ference among trajectories with starting positions placed
inside one reduced unit cell of the crystal surface. Fur-
thermore, for LiF surfaces when the ﬁnal projectile dis-
tribution is plotted as a function of the deﬂection angle
Θ, deﬁned as Θ = arctan(ϕf /θf ), both the position
and intensity of the peaks become completely governed
by the normal energy E⊥ = E sin2 θi, which is related
to the motion in the plane perpendicular to the incident
channel, with E being the impact energy. The angular
positions of the peaks are strongly aﬀected by the cor-
rugation of the atom-surface potential across the axial

6

direction, making possible to probe the potential model
for diﬀerent distances to the surface by varying the E⊥
value. Notice that for low normal energies, both rainbow
and supernumerary rainbow peaks are present in FAD
spectra, but when E⊥ increases supernumerary rainbows
start to blur out, and for large energies only rainbow
structures are observed in the projectile distributions.

To show an overall picture of performance of the pro-
posed potential model, in Fig. 6 we plot the deﬂection
angle corresponding to the rainbow maximum, Θrb, as a
function of E⊥, for closed- shell (Ne and Kr) and open-
shell (S and Cl) atoms grazingly colliding with LiF(001)
along two diﬀerent channels: (cid:104)110(cid:105) and (cid:104)100(cid:105). In the ﬁg-
ure, Θrb values obtained from the proposed pairwise po-
tential model are compared with available experimental
data [13, 18] considering a wide normal energy range that
covers from 0.2 to 80 eV. Note that for high normal en-
ergies, the angular positions of rainbow maxima derived
from the SIVR method agree with those obtained from
classical simulations due to the classical origin of rainbow
scattering.
In the SIVR calculations, the atom-surface
potential was evaluated as the sum of a short-range con-
tribution, derived from the LLPB3LYP approach, and a
long-range contribution accounting for projectile polar-
ization through the dipolar term given by Eq. (20). The
vdW contribution was not included in the simulations
because it was estimated as negligible, as explained in
Sec. III.

From Fig. 6 we observe that for closed-shell projec-
tiles, our potential model yields rainbow angles in very
good accord with the experimental data in the whole
E⊥-range. But for S and Cl projectiles, both open-shell
atoms, the theoretical Θrb values agree with the exper-
imental ones for E⊥ up to 60 and 30 eV, respectively,
running slightly below the experiments at higher normal
energies. This underestimation of rainbow deﬂection an-
gles in the high normal-energy region is associated with
a less corrugated potential energy surface, which aﬀects
projectiles that reach closer distances to the surface, with
maximum approach distances lower than 2.0 a.u. In Fig.
6 we also investigate the inﬂuence of the correlation term,
usually left out in pairwise potential models, by plotting
Θrb values obtained by neglecting the correlation contri-
bution Ec, that is, by using the LLPB approximation, in-
stead of the LLPB3LYP one, to represent the short-range
binary interactions. In all the spectra we found that rain-
bow deﬂection angles derived from the LLPB approach
are very close to those obtained with LLPB3LYP, indi-
cating a weak eﬀect of the correlation term on rainbow
scattering.

Additionally, in the low energy region it is possible to
make a more exhaustive analysis of the surface potential
by using FAD patterns. In Fig. 7 angular positions of
rainbow and supernumerary rainbow maxima, obtained
from SIVR simulations for Ne (closed-shell) and N (open-
shell) atoms impinging on LiF(001) along the (cid:104)110(cid:105) direc-
tion, are compared with experimental FAD data [13, 48],
as a function of E⊥. These FAD maxima represent a

sensitive test of the corrugation of the potential across
the channel.
In this regard, we have chosen the (cid:104)110(cid:105)
channel, instead of the (cid:104)100(cid:105) one, because the former
presents a higher corrugation of the potential across it,
producing consequently richer diﬀraction patterns, with
a larger number of supernumeraries. Notice that the en-
ergy range where supernumerary maxima can be exper-
imentally resolved depends on the projectile mass [13],
being smaller for Ne than for N impact. For Ne projec-
tiles, the SIVR approximation, using the proposed pair-
wise additive potential, reproduces well the experimental
positions of rainbow and supernumerary rainbow maxima
over the whole energy range. But the experimental data
are slightly underestimated when the correlation term is
neglected in the binary potentials. On the contrary, for
N projectiles the inclusion of the correlation term gives
rise to an increase of the deﬂection angles corresponding
to rainbow and supernumerary rainbow peaks, overesti-
mating slightly the experimental values, which are better
reproduced when the LLPB model, without correlation,
is used in the calculations. Similar behavior was also
observed in FAD spectra for He projectiles, case investi-
gated with the present pairwise potential model in Refs.
[21, 22].

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived a pairwise additive potential for neu-
tral atoms interacting with a LiF(001) surface by using
state-of-the-art methods to describe binary potentials in
terms of the electron density. The model incorporates
not only non-local contributions of the electron density,
but also the eﬀect of the ionic crystal lattice on the elec-
tron density around individual ionic sites of the material,
here named onions. For closed-shell (He, Ne, Ar, Kr,
and Xe) and open-shell (N, S, and Cl) atoms, the short-
range and long- range contributions to the corresponding
atom-onion potentials were analyzed as a function of the
internuclear distance, comparing the relative importance
of each term.

The degree of accuracy of the proposed atom-surface
potential model was illustrated by contrasting theoretical
angular positions of rainbow maxima with experimental
data for axial grazing scattering with normal energies
from 0.2 to 80 eV. In this energy range the vdW con-
tribution to the surface potential was estimated as neg-
ligible and consequently, it was not included in the cal-
culations. For two diﬀerent incidence directions - (cid:104)110(cid:105)
and (cid:104)100(cid:105) - and closed-shell projectiles, the rainbow an-
gles derived from the proposed potential were found in
excellent agreement with the experiments in the whole
E⊥- range. For open-shell atoms, instead, an analogous
accord was observed up to intermediate E⊥ values, but
in the high normal energy region our theoretical results
slightly underestimate the experiment. In addition, the
low E⊥- region of the surface potential was deeply probed
by comparing theoretical and experimental angular po-

7

sitions of rainbow and supernumerary rainbow maxima,
which are produced by very sensitive FAD processes. Ex-
perimental data for closed-shell Ne atoms as well as for
open-shell N atoms were fairly well reproduced by our
surface potential. Furthermore, in all the cases the cor-
relation term was found to play a minor role, its eﬀect
being appreciable for low E⊥- values only. Therefore, we
conclude that our pairwise additive potential model can
be used with conﬁdence for closed-shell atoms in the 0.2
-80 eV normal energy range and for open-shell atoms up
to intermediate energies. It is important to point out that
such a potential model presents the advantage of allow-
ing one to extract straightforwardly information about
the diﬀerent interaction mechanisms.

Atom-surface potentials calculated from Eq.

(17)
should support adatoms in front of the LiF surface, that
is, atoms weakly bound to the surface [45]. In the case of
physical absorption from a surface, the binding potential
is characterized by the depth of the attractive well Vb,
the ground-state binding energy Eb, and the equilibrium
distance db from the surface, so that around this posi-
tion the potential behaves as a harmonic oscillator. To
compare with adatom values, we introduce an averaged
potential, without corrugation (planar), valid at a large
distance d from the surface, as

where RA = RF = (0, 0, d) is the position upon the F −
@
onion, RLi = (0, a/2, d) is the one upon Li+
@, and
Rhole = (a/4, a/4, d) is the position upon the center of
the reduced unit cell (hole).

For He projectiles, using η = 0.7 and neglecting any
vdW contribution, we found that Vb = 8.0 meV and
db = 2.99 ˚A, in close agreement with the reported ex-
perimental data 8.5 meV and 2.98 ˚A , respectively [45].
The so-obtained potential W (RA) can be ﬁtted with a
Morse potential to give a binding energy Eb = 5 meV
that compares quite well with the best estimate value
5.9 meV [45]. Similarly, for Ne, using η = 0.72, we found
Vb = 12.7 meV and Eb = 10.9 meV, while the reported
data are 13.5 and 11.7 meV, respectively [45]. For the re-
maining rare gases: Ar, Kr, and Xe we use η = 0.67, 0.64,
and 0.62, producing Vb = 69, 93, and 157 meV, com-
parable with the reported values 70 ± 10, 94.2, and 153
meV, respectively [45]. Therefore, the η value seems
to be rather universal and situates around 0.7, in accor-
dance with our previous ﬁndings [13, 18, 21]. In this work
we used such a value for our SIVR simulations.
