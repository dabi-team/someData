NONLINEAR DAMPED WAVE EQUATIONS FOR THE
SUB-LAPLACIAN ON THE HEISENBERG GROUP AND FOR
ROCKLAND OPERATORS ON GRADED LIE GROUPS

MICHAEL RUZHANSKY AND NIYAZ TOKMAGAMBETOV

Abstract. In this paper we study the Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped
wave equation for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. In the case of the
positive mass, we show the global in time well-posedness for small data for power like
nonlinearities. We also obtain similar well-posedness results for the wave equations
for Rockland operators on general graded Lie groups. In particular, this includes
higher order operators on Rn and on the Heisenberg group, such as powers of
the Laplacian or of the sub-Laplacian. In addition, we establish a new family of
Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities on graded Lie groups that play a crucial role in
the proof, but which are also of interest on their own: if G is a graded Lie group of
homogeneous dimension Q and a > 0, 1 < r < Q

1. Introduction

In this paper we investigate the global in time well-posedness for the damped wave
equation for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. Strichartz estimates for the
wave equation for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group have been analysed by
Bahouri, G´erard and Xu in [BGX00] where a weak decay rate in dispersive estimates
was established. Recently, such results were extended to step 2 stratiﬁed Lie groups
by Bahouri, Fermanian-Kammerer and Gallagher [BFKG16] where it was shown that
the decay rate of solution may depend on the dimension of the centre of the group.
Wave equations for the full Laplacian on the Heisenberg group have been investigated
in [FMV07], [LS14] where better decay rates have been obtained.

One purpose of this paper is to investigate the global in time well-posedness of the

Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped wave equation

with the damping term determined by b > 0 and with the mass m > 0, where Hn

similar results for a more general setting, namely, when the Heisenberg group Hn is
replaced by a general graded Lie group G, and the sub-Laplacian
is replaced by
an arbitrary Rockland operator
, i.e. by an arbitrary left-invariant homogeneous
hypoelliptic diﬀerential operator.

Following Folland and Stein [FS82], we recall that G is a graded Lie group if there

is a gradation on its Lie algebra g, i.e. a vector space decomposition

will all but ﬁnitely many of Vj being zero, see Section 4.1 for a precise deﬁnition.
This leads to a family of dilations on it with rational weights, compatible with the
group structure. If V1 generates g as an algebra, the group is said to be stratiﬁed
and the sum of squares of a basis of vector ﬁelds in V1 yields a sub-Laplacian on
G. However, non-stratiﬁed graded G may not have a homogeneous sub-Laplacian
or Laplacian but they always have so-called Rockland operators. Such operators
appeared in the hypoellipticity considerations by Rockland [Roc78] deﬁned by the
condition that their inﬁnitesimal representations are injective on smooth vectors.
Suitable partial reformulations of this conditions were further proposed by Rockland
[Roc78] and Beals [Bea77], until the resolution in [HN79] by Helﬀer and Nourrigat of
what has become known as the Rockland conjecture, and what we can adopt as the
deﬁnition here:

Rockland operators are left-invariant homogeneous hypoelliptic diﬀerential opera-

tors on G.

In fact, the existence of such operators on nilpotent Lie groups singles out the
class of graded groups, see [Mil80], [tER97]. In the realm of homogeneous Lie groups,
the graded groups can be also characterised by dilations having rational weights, see
[FR16, Section 4.1.1].

Thus, in our extension of the obtained result from the Heisenberg group to graded
. To give some examples,

In the setting of a general graded Lie group G of homogeneous dimension Q, which

Moreover, on stratiﬁed groups, i.e. with ν = 2, this gives the class of semilinear
equations in Theorem 4.6.

However, to simplify the exposition, we give a detailed proof in the case of the sub-
Laplacian on the Heisenberg group, and then indicate the necessary modiﬁcations for
the case of general positive Rockland operators on general graded Lie groups.

In both cases of Hn and more general graded Lie groups G, our proof relies on
the group Fourier analysis on G to obtain the exponential time decay for solutions
to the linear problem. This is possible due to the inclusion of positive mass term
m > 0 leading to the separation of the spectrum of
and of its inﬁnitesimal repre-
sentations from zero. Consequently, the nonlinear analysis relies on the application
of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality on G. While such inequality is well-known
on the Heisenberg group Hn, the known graded group versions in [BFKG12b] or on
[FR16] are not suitable for our analysis. Thus, in Theorem 4.2 we derive the neces-
sary version of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality based on the graded group version
of Sobolev inequality established in [FR16]. More generally, we show that if G is a
graded Lie group of homogeneous dimension Q and

The similar strategy of obtaining L2-estimates for solutions of linear problems has
been used in [GR15] in the analysis of weakly hyperbolic wave equations for the
sub-Laplacians on compact Lie groups. Some techniques of similar type also appear
in the analysis of general operators with discrete spectrum and with time-dependent
coeﬃcients in [RT16] and [RT17]. Estimates in Lp for solution of the wave equation for
the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group were considered in [MS99], and on groups
of Heisenberg type in [MS15]. The potential theory and functional estimates in the
setting of stratiﬁed groups have been recently analysed in [RS17a, RS17b, RS16].

Throughout this paper we will often use the notation . instead of

to avoid
repeating the constants which are not dependent on the main parameters, especially,
on functions appearing in the estimates.

that Γ is a contraction mapping on Z. The Banach ﬁxed point theorem then implies
that Γ has a unique ﬁxed point in Z.
It means that there exists a unique global
solution u of the equation

which also gives the solution to (3.1). So, we now concentrate on proving (3.8) and
(3.9).

4. Nonlinear damped wave equations on graded Lie groups

In this section for a positive Rockland operator

we will derive the well-posedness
results for the semilinear and then for nonlinear wave equation for small Cauchy data.
At ﬁrst, we start by recalling some deﬁnitions and notations following Folland and
Stein [FS82] or [FR16, Section 3.1]. We also establish a new family of Gagliardo-
Nirenberg inequalities on graded Lie groups.

is endowed with a vector space decomposition

g =

Vj such that [Vi, Vj]

⊂

M

and where all but ﬁnitely many of Vj’s are zero. Consequently, a connected simply
connected Lie group G is called graded if its Lie algebra g is graded. A special case
of stratiﬁed G arises when the ﬁrst stratum V1 generates g as an algebra.

Graded Lie groups are necessarily nilpotent. Moreover, they are also homogeneous
Lie groups with a canonical choice of dilations. Namely, let us deﬁne the operator A
by setting AX = jX for X

Vj. Then the dilations on g are deﬁned by

∈

Dr := Exp(A ln r), r > 0.

The homogeneous dimension Q of G is deﬁned by

Q := ν1 + . . . + νn = Tr A.
From now on let G be a graded Lie group. Rockland operators have been originally
deﬁned in [Roc78] through the representation theoretic language. Following [FR16,
