Abstract 

Bulk rhenium trioxide (ReO3) has an unusually high electrical conductivity and, being nanosized, 

has promising catalytic properties. However, the production of pure ReO3 thin films is challenging 

due to the difficulty to stabilize rhenium in a 6+ oxidation state. Here we present a novel approach 

for the deposition of ReOx (x ≈ 1.6–2.9) thin films using reactive high power impulse magnetron 

sputtering (r-HiPIMS) from a metallic rhenium target in a mixed Ar/O2 atmosphere. The thin films 

were  deposited  in  the  gas-sustained  self-sputtering  regime,  observed  during  r-HiPIMS  process 

according to current waveforms. The influence of the substrate temperature, the oxygen-to-argon 

flow ratio and post-annealing at 250 °C in the air for 3 h on the properties of the films were studied. 

The  as-deposited  films  have  an  X-ray  amorphous  structure  (a-ReOx)  when  deposited  at  room 

temperature while a nano-crystalline β-ReO2 phase when deposited at elevated temperatures (150 

or  250  °C).  The  amorphous  a-ReOx  can  be  converted  into  the  crystalline  ReO3  with  a  lattice 

parameter  of  3.75  Å  upon  annealing  in  the  air.  The  surface  morphology  of  the  films  is  dense 

without  detectable  voids  when  elevated  substrate  temperatures  are  used.  Various  Re  oxidation 

states  are  observed  on  the  surface  of  the  films  in  different  ratios  depending  on  the  deposition 

 
parameters.  All  samples  exhibit  electrical  resistivity  on  the  order  of  10-3  Ωcm  and  optical 

properties typical for thin metallic films. 

1.Introduction 

This  study  is  dedicated  to  the  deposition  of  rhenium  oxide  thin  films  by  high  power  impulse 

magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), and the possibility to change the oxidation state of rhenium ions 

upon thermal annealing in air. The chemistry of rhenium (Re) is characterised by a large number 

of oxidation states [1]. Rhenium oxides can contain cations with the oxidation states 4+, 6+, and 

7+ with the corresponding crystalline phases Re2O7, ReO3, and ReO2, respectively. Re7+ and Re4+ 

are the most stable among them. Re oxides are also promising catalytic materials [2-5]. The most 

famous rhenium oxide is ReO3 which is also called a “covalent metal”. ReO3 is a red solid with an 

electrical  conductivity  comparable  to  metals  due  to  the  delocalised  5d  electrons.  It  is  also  a 

negative thermal expansion material [6]. In addition, ReO3 appears to be a suitable precursor to 

achieve nanosheets of ReS2 on carbon fibres [7].   The oxide decomposes into ReO2 and Re2O7 

above 400 °C without melting. ReO3 has perovskite-type structure (ABX3) (space group Pm-3m) 

in which the larger cation (A) site in the centre of the cubic unit cell is empty [8, 9]. The structure 

consists  of  regular  corner-sharing  ReO6  octahedra  with  the  Re−O−Re  angles  equal  to  180°. 

Materials  with  the  BX3  (ReO3-type)  structure  have  many  attractive  properties  due  to  the 

connectivity and openness of the structure, for example, a negative thermal expansion coefficient 

[10],  photocatalysis  [11],  thermoelectricity  [12],  and  superconductivity  [13].  There  are  several 

techniques  for  the  synthesis  of  ReO3  nanoparticles,  which  are  summarized  in  Ref.  [14]. 

Nanocrystalline ReO3 thin films can be prepared by the annealing of amorphous ReOx films at 

approximately  250  °C  in  the  air  under  an  inert  capping  material  [14]. Similarly,  layered  WO3/ 

 
ReO3  and  ReO3/WO3  thin  films  have  recently  been  prepared  [15].  ReO2  is  a  brown  to  black 

material that has two possible structural phases. A monoclinic α-ReO2 (P21/c) structure is similar 

to MoO2 and WO2 and forms below 300 °C. Orthorhombic β-ReO2 (Pbcn) consisting of the corner 

and edge-sharing ReO6 octahedra forms above 300 °C. In both phases, the distance between Re 

atoms is small, indicating a direct metal-metal interaction with the consequential high electrical 

conductivity.  Re2O7 is yellowish, electrically insulating solid that melts at around 300 °C. The 

crystal  structure  (P212121)  consists  of  an  equal  number  of  almost  regular  ReO4  tetrahedra  and 

strongly distorted ReO6 octahedra. The tetrahedra and the octahedra share corners through oxygen 

bridges and form a sheet-type structure with van der Waals bonds between the sheets. Re2O7 is 

volatile  and  easily  converts  into  perrhenic  acid  (HReO4)  when  it  interacts  with  moisture  [16]. 

Nonstoichiometric ReO3 can be obtained by heating the complex of HReO4 and dioxanes [17]. 

The physical properties of thin films are strongly influenced by the ion bombardment during the 

film growth in plasma-based deposition processes [18]. HiPIMS is the technique that provides the 

high ionised density fraction of sputtered species [19]. During the pulse, the plasma density grows 

up to approximately 1020 m-3, which ensures high ionisation. However, the ionised flux fraction 

towards the substrate is almost always lower because the substrate is usually located outside the 

ionisation region and some of the ions in this region  are attracted back to the target due to the 

negative potentials [20]. In addition, this effect also reduces the deposition rate (30–85% of direct 

current  magnetron  sputtering)  [21].  There  are  several  strategies  to  address  these  issues  – 

modification of the magnetic field strength and topology [22], reduction of the sputtering pulse 

[23], use of chopped HiPIMS [24], or introduction of an additional ionisation zone further away 

from the target [25]. Nevertheless, the ionised flux can be controlled by an electric and magnetic 

field to adjust the properties of the growing film.  

HiPIMS has been shown to provide dense and smooth films with good adhesion [21, 26], good 

control of the film’s microstructure [27], improvements in mechanical [28] and other properties at 

low  deposition  temperatures  [29,  30],  and  uniform  coverage  on  non-flat  substrates  [31].  As 

HiPIMS  is  already  a  well-established  coating  technology  in  the  field  of  hard  coatings,  it  can 

become more relevant in the fields of catalytic or optoelectronic film deposition in the future.  

In  this  study,  HiPIMS  technology  is  used  to  search  for  technological  benefits  in  the  field  of 

rhenium oxide synthesis. We study the HiPIMS of a Re target by varying the pulsing frequency 

and  the  oxygen  content  in  the  discharge  atmosphere.  At  every  given  sputtering  condition,  the 

current-voltage-time (C-V-t) characteristics, as well as the plasma optical emission spectra (OES), 

were recorded. At certain conditions, the rhenium oxide films were deposited and characterised by 

X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM), UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and conductivity measurements. The composition ReOx highly 

depends on the synthesis conditions, and x ranges from 1.6 to 2.9. The deposition temperatures 

mainly determines the oxidation state of rhenium ions and the corresponding structure. In addition, 

the composition may be affected by the amount of oxygen used during sputtering. The annealing 

in air promotes further oxidation of rhenium oxide thin films. To the best of our knowledge, this 

is the first study of rhenium oxides thin films deposition by HiPIMS. 

2. Experimental details 

The  experiments  were  performed  using  the  R&D  vacuum  coater  SAF25/50  (Sidrabe  Vacuum, 

Ltd.). A two-inch circular, balanced magnetron (Gencoa, Ltd) was used. The power was supplied 

by a MP2-AS 200 pulse power supply unit (Magpuls GmbH) operating in the unipolar negative 

regime at a constant average power of 100 W. The constant power regime was selected to prevent 

 
target damage. The negative voltage was supplied to the magnetron cathode against a grounded 

anode. The discharge voltage and current were measured by a Magpuls GmbH measuring system 

and recorded by a RIGOL DS1054 digital oscilloscope. 

The plasma optical emission spectra (OES) from the discharge were collected by an optical fibre 

probe located in the chamber overlooking the discharge parallel 1.5 cm above the target surface. 

The time-average OES were measured by a PLASUS EMICON MC spectrometer (200–1100 nm). 

A  metallic  Re  target  (99.99%  purity,  50  mm  diameter,  and  3  mm  thickness)  was  sputtered  in 

metallic (Ar) and reactive (Ar+O2) atmospheres. The C-V-t characteristics and OES were studied 

as a function of the pulsing frequency (110 Hz–952 Hz and DC) by changing the time between 50 

µs  long  pulses  and  the  oxygen  gas  flow  rate  (0–10  sccm).  In  all  cases,  the  pulse  voltage  was 

constant for the entire pulse length. The arc-detect threshold value was set to 50 A in the HiPIMS 

mode. Before the investigation of the sputtering process and the ReOx film deposition, the chamber 

(≈ 0.1 m3) was pumped down to a base pressure below 9.5 × 10-6 mbar by a turbo-molecular pump 

backed with a rotary pump. The Ar (99.99% purity) flow rate of 20 sccm was kept constant in both 

the  metallic  and  reactive  modes.  The  pumping  speed  was  altered  by  a  throttle  valve  to  set  the 

working pressure of approximately 7.3 × 10-3 mbar during the sputtering. 

The film thickness was determined by a CART Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer. The structure of 

the samples was examined by a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. 

The morphology of the ReOx films was characterized by a Thermo Scientific Helios 5 UX high-

resolution dual-beam microscope. 

X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  analyses  were  carried  out  using  a  ThermoFisher 

ESCALAB Xi+ instrument using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The instrument binding 

energy scale was calibrated to give binding energy at 932.6 eV for the Cu 2p3/2 line of a freshly 

etched metallic copper. The charge compensation system was used. The surface of each sample 

was irradiated with a flood of electrons to produce a nearly neutral surface charge. The spectra 

were recorded using an X-ray beam size of 900 × 10 μm with a pass energy of 20 eV, and a step 

size of 0.1 eV. Data from all materials  were referenced using the main signal of the carbon 1s 

spectrum  occurring  at  284.8  eV.  The  carbon  1s  spectrum  was  collected  using  high-energy-

resolution settings. No cleaning of the surface (etching) was used before measuring the survey and 

high-resolution  spectra,  as  higher-order  rhenium–oxygen  compounds  are  easily  reduced  during 

sputtering. Mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peak shapes were used to fit the Re 4f XPS high-resolution 

spectra by the XPSPEAK41 software. The spacing between the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 components for all 

peaks was  fixed to  correspond to the spin-orbit splitting of 2.5  (+0.2/-0.1) eV. To improve the 

reliability of the peak fitting, the intensity ratio of 4f5/2:4f7/2 peaks was set to 0.787. 

The  electrical  resistivity  was  measured  in  the  Van  der  Pauw  configuration  using  a  Hall  effect 

system, HMS5000. The film’s transmittance and reflectance in the range of 330–2500 nm were 

determined by an Agilent Cary 7000 spectrophotometer. The sample was placed at an angle of 6° 

against the incident beam, and the detector was placed at 180° behind the sample to measure the 

transmittance and at 12° in front of the sample to measure the specular reflectance. 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. Discharge waveforms 

The HiPIMS process of a Re target was investigated in both metallic and reactive modes before 

the rhenium oxide film deposition. In the beginning, the Re target sputtering in an Ar atmosphere 

was gradually changed from a DC to a low-frequency pulsed regime (110 Hz) by increasing the 

 
off-time (toff) between pulses (up to 9 ms) to study the influence of the pulsing frequency on the 

magnetron discharge. The average power of 100 W and the pulse duration time of 50 μs were kept 

constant. 

The peak  current  and the voltage  grow when the frequency is  reduced to  maintain the average 

power (Fig. 1(a)). The sputtering regime reaches the HiPIMS level of 0.5 kW/cm2 (defined in [32]) 

in the toff range between 3 and 6 ms. There is a time lag with respect to the applied voltage  of 

approximately 10 μs before the current starts to rise. The delay time is associated with the discharge 

ignition phase where the current is very small and the plasma is negligible. It seems that the delay 

time with toff does not change much. This is understandable because a time lag should decrease 

with voltage; on the other hand, it should increase if fewer charged particles are available at the 

beginning of a pulse, which is the case when the pulse repetition rate is reduced [33]. After the 

time lag, the current increases sharply because the production of electrons is faster compared to 

the  recombination  and  disappearance  [34].  The  increase  in  the  energetic  electrons,  which  are 

trapped  in  the  magnetic  field  close  to  the  target  surface,  strongly  enhances  the  working  gas 

ionisation. The plasma impedance decreases as the concentration of the charge carriers grow. The 

initial  phase  of  the  current  rise  is  dominated  by  gas  ions  [35],  and  electrons  gain  energy  from 

sheath acceleration and Ohmic heating [36, 37]. Also, working gas rarefaction sets in at this point 

in time. The rarefaction is a localised depletion of the working gas in front of a target due to gas 

heating, which is  caused by  the discharge itself,  the hot  target  surface, the momentum transfer 

between sputtered atoms (also  reflected sputtering  gas atoms) and gas, and the electron impact 

ionisation [38, 39]. 

Fig. 1. C-V-t characteristics as a function of frequency during the Re target sputtering in an Ar 

atmosphere at a constant average power mode (100 W) and pulse length (50 µs). 

The current reaches the peak value of 4 A (the peak current density of 0.24 A/cm2) in the middle 

of the pulse (at 25 μs) and remains constant for the remaining pulse time when using a toff of 1 ms. 

When toff is increased above 1 ms, the shape of the current profile changes qualitatively. After the 

peak current in the middle of a pulse, the current starts to decrease. The depletion of working gas 

atoms  in  the  ionisation  region  gets  stronger  and  faster  when  the  discharge  current  rises. 

Consequently, the source of ions that carry the discharge current is highly reduced when the current 

reaches  the peak,  resulting in  a rapid  decrease in the current  after the peak [40]. The temporal 

evolution of the discharge current reaches a stable plateau value of 8 A (0.48 A/cm2) at the end of 

a pulse when using a toff of 3 ms. It is reasonable to assume that a stable plateau current would also 

be observed at a longer toff (6 and 9 ms in Fig. 1) if longer pulses are used. The highest peak current 

of 17 A (1.02 A/cm2) is measured when using a toff of 9 ms. In this case, the peak value is reached 

later into the pulse at 31 µs compared to the shorter toff values.

The critical current density  Jcrit (defined in [41]) is approximately 0.15 A/cm2 in our case. This 

value defines the maximum possible ion current if all incoming gas atoms from the surrounding 

volume are singly ionised and accelerated towards the target, taking into account the thermal refill 

rate of the working gas. A higher current density than Jcrit cannot be obtained without either an 

additional working gas or sputtered target material ion recycling (Igas-recycle and ISS, respectively) 

or a mixture of both processes. This means that already at a toff of 1 ms, a significant fraction of 

the discharge current (ID) carrying ions is recycled. In general, the fractions Igas-recycle/ID and ISS/ID 

are determined by the self-sputter yield YSS [42]. For high-YSS target materials, ISS/ID dominates 

over Igas-recycle/ID.  For example, a HiPIMS discharge of  an Al target  with  YSS = 1.1 at  600 V is 

strongly dominated by the self-sputtering recycling where a large amount of sputtered atoms is 

ionised (ionisation energy of neutral Al is around 6 eV) and drawn back to the target, creating a 

high discharge current [36]. Since YSS of Re is close to that of Al, approximately 1.1 at an even 

lower voltage of 480 V (value of the voltage at 1 ms toff in this study) [43], it can be argued that 

the self-sputtering dominates over working gas ion recycling also in the case of Re. Although the 

ionisation energy of neutral Re (7.8 eV) is higher than that of Al, it is still well below the ionisation 

energy of neutral Ar (15.8 eV). Since the Ar ion contribution is small and singly ionised Re cannot 

generate secondary electrons, Ohmic heating is the main source for electron energisation [44]. The 

above-described  analysis  of  the  temporal  evolution  of  a  discharge  current  during  the  Re  target 

sputtering confirms the gas-sustained self-sputtering regime where the current is dominated by Re 

ion  recycling.  At  the  same  time,  an  ionized  Ar  gas  is  required  and  provides  an  important 

contribution to the discharge. In addition, the discharge current at the end of the pulse gradually 

increases  with  the  voltage  without  a  sudden  large  jump  (Fig.  1).  This  also  indicates  the  gas-

sustained  self-sputtering  since  the  self-sputter  yield  is  a  smooth  function  of  the  energy  of  the 

bombarding ions. 

The evolution of the discharge current during reactive (r-) HiPIMS is shown in Fig. 2. The shape 

of  a  current  waveform  changes  and  the  peak  value  reduces  significantly  immediately  after  the 

addition of oxygen gas to the background gas. In general, the peak current tends to increase when 

a compound layer starts to form on the target surface in r-HiPIMS [29, 45]. This is due to a reduced 

sputter  yield  with  a  consequential  increase  in  the  working-gas  recycling  to  compensate  for  the 

reduced self-sputtering. As a result, the secondary electron contribution fraction into the electron 

energisation also increases, and the current can reach very high values [46]. However, this is not 

the case in our study. The current waveforms in r-HiPIMS of Re indicate that the discharge is still 

in the self-sputter recycling mode, but with a lower peak current compared to the pure metal mode. 

This  indicates  a  lower  ionization  efficiency  of  Ar  gas  and  sputtered  Re  atoms.  This  might  be 

explained by lower secondary electron emission. The work function of 5.1 eV for a pure Re surface 

substantially increases to approximately 7.1 eV after oxidation [47]. A higher work function leads 

to lower secondary emission according to the empirical formula for the emission determined by 

the potential energy of the arriving ion projectiles [48]. The increase from 10 A to 12 A observed 

in  the  peak  current  with  the  oxygen  flow  (Fig.  2)  indicates  an  increase  in  the  gas-recycling 

contribution.

and O2 atmosphere at a constant average power mode (100 W) and pulse length (50 µs). 

3.2. Plasma OES 

The plasma composition was investigated using OES recorded approximately 1.5 cm above the 

Re target surface. The spectra as a function of toff and oxygen gas flow are shown in Fig. 3. The 

plasma emission is dominated by neutral Ar (Ar I) emission lines with relatively less intense lines 

of neutral Re (Re I) at the DC discharge. Low intense ionized Ar (Ar II) lines can also be observed. 

The intensity of the Ar I and Ar II lines rapidly decreases, whereas the intensity of Re I increases 

sharply when the discharge is switched to the pulsed regime with a toff of 1 ms. This is the result 

of the already described Ar gas rarefaction. A further increase in toff reduces the intensity of the Ar 

I, Ar II, and Re I lines (Fig 4(a-c)), whereas the intensity of the Re II lines grows (Fig 4(d)), which 

is in line with the evolvement of self-sputter recycling. However, the intensity of the Re II lines is 

still significantly lower compared to the Re I lines. At the low frequency discharge (110 Hz, toff of 

9 ms), the plasma emission spectrum mainly consists of the Re I emission lines.

The ionised flux fraction (the ratio of the ion flux to the total particle flux arriving at the substrate 

or detector [20]) in the case of Al and Ti is ≥ 50% for typical HiPIMS conditions – a peak current 

density of approximately 1 A/cm2 and a sputtering pressure in the range from 0.5 to 2.0 Pa [45]. It 

can be predicted that the ionisation fraction in the case of Re could have a similar value because, 

although Re has a higher ionisation energy (7.8 eV) compared to Al (6.0 eV) and Ti (6.8 eV), it 

has a larger collision cross-section of electron impact ionisation [49].

3.3. Prepared ReOx samples 

ReOx (x ≈ 1.6–2.9) thin films were deposited on fused quartz substrates by reactive high power 

impulse  magnetron  sputtering  (r-HiPIMS)  in  a  mixed  Ar/O2  atmosphere.  The  substrates  were 

ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and 2-isopropanol for 15 min each, rinsed with distilled water, 

and  then  dried  under  blown  N2  gas.  Samples  were  produced  at  three  different  substrate 

temperatures:  36  °C  (without  intentional  heating),  150  °C,  and  250  °C;  and  at  two  different

oxygen-to-argon flow ratios: 0.4 and 0.5 (see Table 1). The substrates were located approximately 

13 cm away from the target surface (a substrate facing the target axis) on the grounded substrate 

holder. The angle between the target and the substrate was fixed at ≈ 45. After the depositions, 

the  samples  were  directly  transferred  (without  breaking  the  vacuum)  and  stored  in  an  Ar 

atmosphere  glove-box  connected  to  the  vacuum  system  to  protect  the  films  from  possible 

degradation (see Fig. S1 in the supplementary material) under ambient conditions. The average 

thickness of the films is approximately 150 nm. During the annealing of the films at 250 °C in the 

air for 3 h, a clean piece of quartz was placed on the sample surface to avoid the evaporation of 

rhenium oxide. The resistivity of the films is on the order of 10-3 Ωcm and summarised in Table 1. 

No clear correlation was observed between the resistivity and the deposition parameters or post-

treatment.  The  measurements  of  the  as-deposited  and  annealed  films  were  performed  for  two 

separate pieces of the same sample. There may be slight differences between the pieces, which 

may cause inconsistency.

3.4. Structural analysis using XRD 

X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited ReOx films on fused quartz substrates (recorded over 

a  2θ-range  of  10°–80°)  are  shown  in  Fig.  5  depending  on  the  deposition  temperature  and  the 

oxygen-to-argon flow ratio. The broad peak at 2=21.2° is due to the substrate. X-ray patterns of 

the films grown on non-heated substrates (samples a and b) do not show Bragg peaks associated 

with any of the pure rhenium  oxides suggesting that the films are X-ray amorphous. A peak at 

around  16.6°  with  low  intensity  corresponds  to  crystalline  perrhenic  acid  monohydrate 

(HReO4·H2O) [16]. Interestingly, this phase was not observed in rhenium oxide films, which were 

deposited at RT by reactive pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering in our earlier study [14]. However, 

it  formed  after  the  same  annealing  procedure  was  used  in  this  study.  Two  XRD  peaks  with 

relatively low intensity at 37.3 and 53.9° appear when the deposition temperature increases up to 

150 °C or 250 °C (samples c, d, and e). These peaks correspond to the orthorhombic β-ReO2 lattice 

planes (200) and (221) according to the powder diffraction card ICDD 00-009-0274. Note that the 

signal from HReO4·H2O disappears at elevated substrate temperatures. The size of the crystallites 

according to the Scherrer equation is about 7 nm. The only difference observed between 150 °C 

or 250 °C deposition temperatures for the same oxygen-to-argon ratio is the intensity ratio between 

 
the two XRD peaks. The oxygen-to-argon ratio, which ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 in this study, did not 

affect  the  structure  of  the  as-deposited  films  according  to  the  XRD  measurements.  In  the 

framework of this study, it was not possible to obtain a crystalline ReO3 film during the deposition 

process.

substrate temperatures and oxygen-to-argon flow ratios. The deposition parameters of samples a-

e can be found in Table 1. The angles of the Bragg peaks for the orthorhombic β-ReO2 [50] and 

tetragonal HReO4 [16] phases are shown by vertical black and purple dashed lines, respectively. 

The  as-deposited  films  were  annealed  as  described  in  the  experimental  details.  The  X-ray 

diffraction  patterns  in  Fig.  6  reveal  the  formation  of  a  crystalline  ReO3  phase  in  the  X-ray 

amorphous films (samples  a and  b) after the  annealing. Diffraction maximums  at  23.8°, 33.9°, 

41.8°, 48.6°, 54.8°, 60.5°, and 76.4° correspond to the (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), and 

(300) planes of the cubic ReO3. Rietveld analysis of the XRD data gives the lattice parameter of

3.75 Å, which is in excellent agreement with the ICDD card 04-004-8088. The conversion process 

from  the amorphous to  the crystalline phase takes a longer time (at  least  2 h) compared to  the 

pulsed-DC deposited films (30 min) in Ref. [14]. This might be since films grown by HiPIMS 

compared to  DC magnetron sputtering are, in  general, denser, which hinders the crystallisation 

process. In addition, the crystallite size of 50 nm according to the Scherrer equation is also smaller 

compared  to  the  pulsed-DC  deposited  films  (100–500  nm).  After  the  annealing,  the  crystalline 

ReO3 phase was also observed in the film deposited at 150 °C with an oxygen-to-argon ratio of 

0.4 but not in the film with an oxygen-to-argon ratio of 0.5. Since the resistivity (Table 1) of the 

films  containing  the  crystalline  ReO3  phase  is  about  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than 

theoretically  and  experimentally  obtainable  (0.9  ×  10-6  Ωcm  [51,  52]),  it  seems  that  the  whole 

structure is not converted to crystalline ReO3 and contains structural defects, thus the mobility and 

concentration of the charge carriers are reduced. No changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the 

film deposited at 250 °C were observed after the annealing procedure.

3.5. Surface morphology – SEM images 

The surface of the films before and after the annealing was imaged by SEM (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). 

The as-deposited films at RT (samples a and b) have a defect-rich surface. The film deposited at 

an  oxygen-to-argon  ratio  of  0.4  contains  large  open  cavities  with  a  size  of  a  few  hundred 

nanometres  (Fig.  7(a)),  which  are  most  likely  formed  after  exposure  to  air.  When  the  ratio  is 

increased to 0.5, the morphology of the surface differs, but it is still porous with a large number of 

submicron voids (Fig. 7(b)). The surface gets significantly smoother and is featureless when the 

substrate temperature is increased (Fig. 7(c–e)). The films deposited at 150 °C (samples c and d) 

have a dense surface with nano-sized open cavities. The surface becomes even denser with a fine-

grained structure for the film deposited at 250 °C (sample e). 

 
Fig. 7. SEM images of the as-deposited rhenium oxide films deposited by r-HiPIMS at RT and 

O2/Ar = 0.4 (a), RT and O2/Ar = 0.5 (b), 150 °C and O2/Ar = 0.4 (c), 150 °C and O2/Ar = 0.5 (d), 

250 °C and O2/Ar = 0.5 (e). 

After the annealing, the films deposited at RT contain crystallites of different sizes (on average ≈ 

50 nm) and orientations (Fig. 8(a–b)). The crystallisation is in line with our XRD measurements 

that show a crystalline ReO3 phase. The surface structure is not closely packed, most likely due to 

the partial sublimation of ReO3 during the annealing [53]. 

Crystallites of sub-micrometre size are observed on the surface of the films deposited at 150 °C 

after the annealing (Fig. 8(c–d)). The crystallites are most likely of the insulating solid perrhenic 

acid  monohydrate  HReO4·H2O  phase  and  form  on  the  surface  over  time  after  exposure  to  air 

 
 
 
 
  
 
moisture [3, 14]. It has been shown that the rhenium-to-oxygen concentration ratio on the surface 

of rhenium oxide deposited films decreases over time [54]. The X-ray diffraction patterns do not 

show  any  narrow  peaks  corresponding  to  the  single  crystals,  most  likely  because  the  SEM 

measurements were performed later than the XRD. After half a year, the X-ray diffraction pattern 

of the annealed sample c shows only the HReO4·H2O phase, and all the peaks due to ReO3 have 

disappeared (Fig. S2 in the supplementary material). It also  clearly shows the instability of the 

ReO3 phase under ambient conditions. The surface of the crystalline ReO3 phase revealed by XRD 

(Fig. 6) is, again, not densely packed for the film deposited at 150 °C with an oxygen-to-argon 

ratio of 0.4 (Fig. 8(c)). For an Ar/O2 ratio of 0.5, the surface is densely packed, and the partly 

immersed crystallites on the surface have a tetragonal dipyramidal shape with sharp edges, which 

corresponds to the I41/a space group of HReO4·H2O. The surface of the sample deposited at 250 

°C still has a dense fine-grained structure without significant changes after the annealing.

and O2/Ar = 0.5 (d), 250 °C and O2/Ar = 0.5 (e).  

3.6. Surface composition analysis – XPS measurements 

The composition  and chemical  state of the  rhenium  oxide film  surfaces were  studied by X-ray 

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The measurements were performed after brief exposure of the 

samples to air. The survey spectra contain well-defined signals from Re and O elements (Fig. S3 

in  the  supplementary  material).  The  ratio  of  the  atomic  concentration  between  Re  and  O  as  a 

function of the deposition temperature and the oxygen-to-argon flow ratio in both as-deposited and 

annealed films is shown in Fig. 9. The Re/O ratio of the films deposited at RT (samples a and b) 

is about 0.46 before the annealing. Interestingly, the composition of the film deposited at RT and 

O2/Ar = 0.5 changes significantly after the annealing and is close to ReO3. This ratio grows and is 

in the range between 0.58 and 0.61 when the elevated deposition temperatures (150 or 250 °C) are 

used during the deposition (samples c, d, and e). The sub-stoichiometric oxide composition may 

explain the growth of Re2O7 and the consequential HReO4·H2O crystallites on the surface (Fig. 

8(c,d)),  as  it  has  been  shown  that  Re2O7  forms  on  the  surface  of  the  Re  metal  in  an  oxidizing 

environment [3]. The Re/O ratio decreases for all annealed films due to the elevated oxidation in 

air. In addition, the oxygen content in the films is slightly larger if a higher oxygen-to-argon flow 

ratio is used, which was already expected. 

 
Fig.  9.  Re  to  O  atomic  concentration  ratio  as  a  function  of  the  deposition  temperature  and  the 

oxygen-to-argon flow ratio in both as-deposited and annealed films. 

The high-resolution XPS spectra of Re 4f transitions for the samples deposited at RT and 250 °C 

(samples b and e) are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. The influence of the deposition temperature 

on the shape of the spectra is visible. The spectra are complex and difficult to analyse because they 

consist of overlapping signals from several possible Re oxidation states (e.g. 4+, 6+, 7+ [1]) and 

plasmon satellites [55] within a relatively narrow energy range. There is still inconsistency in the 

literature about the exact binding energies for different Re oxidation states which are required to 

correctly identify them. This is most likely due to the different oxidation states of rhenium when 

it forms oxides. Some of the oxides are unstable and can easily transform into one another, which 

may lead to incorrect interpretations. The intense peak around 43.4 eV in Fig. 11(c) was assigned 

to  the Re6+  4f7/2 and served as a  reference point for other oxidation  state energies because this 

sample clearly showed the ReO3 phase according to the XRD results and the binding energy is 

rather close to the value of 43.1 eV found in the literature [3].

The average  binding  energies  for three oxidation states of rhenium are summarised in Table 2. 

Note that in the case of the crystalline ReO3 phase, broad plasmon energy-loss satellites provide 

an additional contribution to the spectra [56]. These features are shifted by 2.1 eV (plasma edge) 

from the Re6+ peaks and coincide with the positions of the Re7+ peaks. 

Fig. 10. Re 4f high-resolution XPS spectra of the rhenium oxide films deposited by r-HiPIMS at 

RT and 250 °C (O2/Ar = 0.5 in both cases). 

The Re 4f spectrum (Fig. 11(a)) of the as-deposited film at RT (sample b) shows that the surface 

mainly contains Re7+ and Re6+ species (68% Re7+, 29% Re6+, 3% Re4+). The Re4+ peaks disappear 

completely, and both Re7+and Re6+ peaks become narrower after the annealing, which correlates 

with  the  formation  of  crystalline  ReO3  (Fig.  11(c)).  A  significant  contribution  of  the  plasmon 

energy-loss satellites is expected here. Rhenium oxides, on the other hand, tend to form a layer of 

Re2O7 when exposed to air [3]. This layer then adsorbs water and forms hydroxides. As a result, 

the peaks towards the high-binding-energy end of the spectra (marked as 7+ here) are extremely 

broad and hard to resolve into individual components.

The surface of the sample deposited at 250 °C shows almost identical Re 4f spectra before and 

after the annealing (Fig. 11(b,d)). The spectra contain well-resolved Re4+ peaks, which correlate 

with the formation of the nano-crystalline ReO2 phase according to XRD. Again, after the exposure 

to  air,  the  presence  of  Re6+  and  Re7+  on  the  surface  of  the  ReO2  powder  has  already  been 

demonstrated [3]. In our case, the surface contains 42% Re7+, 33% Re6+, and 25% Re4+ before the 

annealing and 36% Re7+, 33% Re6+, and 31% Re4+ after. 

The high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s for the annealed sample a is shown in Fig. S4 in the 

supplementary material. One can see that it contains several components at 529.8 eV, 531.1 eV, 

and 532.8 eV. The smallest energy component corresponds to metal oxide while the other one is 

due to organic C-O, C=O contaminants on the surface of the sample.

3.7. UV-Vis-NIR transmittance and reflectance 

Figure 12 shows the transmittance and specular reflectance of the rhenium oxide films deposited 

on fused quartz measured in the range from 330 to 2500 nm. All the films absorb highly (65–95%) 

in the visible light range (Fig. S5 in the supplementary material). The as-deposited films exhibit a 

metallic dark grey colour. After annealing of the films deposited at RT (samples a and b) and the 

film  deposited  at  150  °C,  O2/Ar  =  0.4  (sample  c),  the  colour  changes  from  grey  to  red  in  the 

reflected light, indicating the formation of a crystalline ReO3 phase. The spectra of these samples 

show  a  transmittance  window  from  400  to  650  nm,  where  the  transmittance  increases  to 

approximately 27.5% for samples b and c (Fig. 12(c)). Within this range, the reflectance reaches a 

minimum value of approximately 1% at the plasma edge of 530 nm (2.3 eV), which is responsible 

for  the  red  colour  (Fig.  12(d)).  The  absorption  below  400  nm  is  associated  with  interband 

transitions, and the absorption above 650 nm is due to the free electrons.

rhenium oxide films, respectively, on fused quartz substrates in the range of 330–2500 nm. The 

deposition parameters of samples a-e can be found in Table 1. 

Analyzing XRD (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) and XPS data (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11), we can conclude, that ReOx 

film deposited at 250°C consist  mainly of the nanocrystalline ReO2 phase. That is  why neither 

XRD nor XPS does not show any changes in the crystal phase or rhenium oxidation state after 

annealing. It is known, that ReO3 sublimates at a temperature above 400 °C (however, we observed 

ReO3 sublimation already at 200 °C), and upon heating in a vacuum disproportionate to Re2O7 and 

ReO2 [58].  The sublimation temperature of Re2O7 is 360 °C, while the melting point of ReO2 is 

above 1000 °C [58]. Optical measurements (Fig. 12) confirm this conclusion: rhenium oxide film 

as-prepared  at  250  °C  shows  no  transparency  window  around  500  nm  (Fig.  12(a)  -  e),  and  no 

transparency  window  is  present  also  after  annealing  (Fig.  12(c)  -  e).  A  transparency  window 

around  500  nm  is  associated  with  the  ReO3  phase  [14].  The  situation  is  the  opposite  with  RT 

deposited  rhenium  oxide  thin  films.  Films  as-deposited  at  RT  are  X-ray  amorphous  (showing 

Re2O7 crystals only), while after annealing at 250 °C clear ReO3 phase appears (Fig. 5(a,b) and

Fig.  6(a,b)).  XPS  measurements  of  both  as-deposited  and  annealed  RT  thin  films  show  the 

presence of Re 6+ and Re 7+ (associated with ReO3 and Re2O7, respectively). Optical measurements 

agree well with XRD and XPS data. As-prepared RT thin films have a clearly visible transparency 

window around 500 nm (Fig.12(a) - a, b), which becomes much more pronounced after annealing 

(Fig.  12(c)  a,b).  Thus,  by  properly  combining  deposition  temperature  and  post-annealing,  it  is 

possible to get either ReO3 or ReO2 thin-film coatings.  

4. Conclusions 

This study reports on the novel approach for the deposition of ReOx (x ≈ 1.6–2.9) thin films using 

reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (r-HiPIMS) from a metallic rhenium target in a 

mixed  Ar/O2  atmosphere.  The  influence  of  the  following  annealing  in  air  on  the  properties  of 

rhenium  oxide  films  is  also  shown.  The  deposited  thin  films  were  characterized  by  X-ray 

diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrical resistivity, 

and optical measurements. 

The Re HiPMS discharge current waveforms in a pure Ar atmosphere confirm the gas-sustained 

self-sputtering regime when operating above the critical current density of 0.15 A/cm2. The peak 

current decreases significantly when oxygen gas is introduced into the chamber.  

The as-deposited at room temperature ReOx (x ≈ 2.2) films are X-ray amorphous, and their surface 

contains a large number of open cavities and voids. When these films are annealed under a capping 

quartz slide at 250 °C in air, the structural transformation into the nano-crystalline phase of ReO3 

occurs. The chemical composition of the annealed film deposited at RT and O2/Ar = 0.5 is ReO2.9. 

When elevated substrate temperatures of 150 or 250 °C are used during the deposition, a relatively 

 
dense structure of the nano-crystalline β-ReO2 phase grows on the substrate. The produced films 

have low electrical resistivity and optical properties typical for thin metallic films.
