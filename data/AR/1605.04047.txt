ABSTRACT
We investigate the footpoints of four erupted magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs) that appear as sigmoidal
hot channels prior to the eruptions in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly high temperaure passbands.
The simultaneous Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager observations disclose that one footpoint of the
MFRs originates in the penumbra or penumbra edge with a stronger magnetic ﬁeld, while the other
in the moss region with a weaker magnetic ﬁeld. The signiﬁcant deviation of the axis of the MFRs
from the main polarity inversion lines and associated ﬁlaments suggests that the MFRs have ascended
to a high altitude, thus being distinguishable from the source sigmoidal ARs. The more interesting
thing is that, with the eruption of the MFRs, the average inclination angle and direct current at the
footpoints with stronger magnetic ﬁeld tend to decrease, which is suggestive of a straightening and
untwisting of the magnetic ﬁeld in the MFR legs. Moreover, the associated ﬂare ribbons also display
an interesting evolution. They initially appear as sporadical brightenings at the two footpoints of
and in the regions below the MFRs and then quickly extend to two slender sheared J-shaped ribbons
with the two hooks corresponding to the two ends of the MFRs. Finally, the straight parts of the
two ribbons separate from each other, evolving into two widened parallel ones. These features mostly
conforms to and supports the recently proposed three-dimensional standard CME/ﬂare model, i.e.,
the twisted MFR eruption stretches and leads to the reconnection of the overlying ﬁeld that transits
from a strong to weak shear with the increasing height.

INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and ﬂares are among
the most spectacular explosive phenomena in our solar
system. They are able to release various relativistic par-
ticles and eject a large quantity of plasma and magnetic
ﬂux with a velocity of hundreds of km s−1, even up to
3000 km s−1 (Yashiro et al. 2004), into the interplan-
etary space. When arriving at the Earth, these ener-
getic particles and high-speed magnetized plasma may
interact with the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and se-
riously aﬀect the safety of human high-tech activities in
the outer space such as disrupting communications, over-
loading power grids, presenting a hazard to astronauts,
and so on (Webb et al. 1994; Liu et al. 2014).

In the past decades, theoretical solar physicists pro-
posed that a magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR), a coherent mag-
netic structure with the ﬁeld lines wrapping around the
central axis more than once, is the fundamental struc-
ture in the CME/ﬂare dynamical process (e.g., Shibata
et al. 1995; Chen 1996; Titov & D´emoulin 1999; Chen
2011; Vourlidas et al. 2013). Forbes & Isenberg (1991)
studied a cylindrical MFR and found that such helical
structure can suddenly loss its equilibrium and rapidly
erupt upward. Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006) considered a freely
expanded current torus. With a detailed analysis, they
concluded that the MFR can experience a nonlinear ex-
pansion if the background magnetic ﬁeld that constrains
the MFR declines fast enough. Such an expansion insta-
bility is also named as torus instability. Following the

work of Kliem & T¨or¨ok (2006), Olmedo & Zhang (2010)
further studied a more realistic situation, in which two
footpoints of the MFR are line-tied to the photosphere,
well resembling the pre-eruption state of the MFR. They
pointed out that the threshold of torus instability not
only depends on the decline of the background ﬁeld but
also on the geometrical circularity of the MFR: a ra-
tio of the MFR arc length above the photosphere to its
circumference. Besides torus instability, kink instabil-
ity can also initiate an eruption. When the twist of the
MFR exceeds a critical value, the axis of the MFR will
rapidly deform, transforming part of the twist into writhe
(T¨or¨ok et al. 2004; Fan & Gibson 2007). Meanwhile, the
height of the MFR quickly ascends, triggering the MFR
eruption (e.g., Ji et al. 2003; Guo et al. 2010a; Srivastava
et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2014a; Yan et al. 2014).

In addition to ideal MHD instabilities, reconnection-
associated mechanisms such as tether-cutting (Moore
et al. 2001) and breakout reconnection (Antiochos et al.
1999; Chen & Shibata 2000; Karpen et al. 2012) are also
proposed to interpret the initiation of the MFR. By con-
trast, these two models do not require that the MFR
has to exist prior to the eruption. In the tether-cutting
model, the erupted magnetic ﬁeld initially is comprised
of two groups of sheared arcades. The reconnection be-
tween the sheared arcades will form a helical magnetic
ﬁeld, i.e., the nascent MFR (e.g., Liu et al. 2013; Chen
et al. 2014b). An upward Lorentz force is simultane-
ously generated to initiate the MFR. On the contrary,
the breakout model consists of a quadrupole ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration with a null point situated at between the cen-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

tral arcade and the overlying large-scale ﬁeld. Once the
reconnection near the null point commences, the overly-
ing ﬁeld will be opened, leading to the reduction of the
downward tension and thus the rise of the central arcade
(e.g., Zuccarello et al. 2008; Shen et al. 2012; Lynch &
Edmondson 2013).

No matter which model applies, the ﬂare reconnec-
tion below the erupted conﬁguration can be switched on,
which rapidly produces the poloidal ﬂux to accelerate
the eruption of the MFR. At the same time, the fast re-
connection generates energetic electrons, which stream
down along newly reconnected ﬁeld lines and heat the
chromosphere, mapping two elongated ribbon-like struc-
tures and casuing the ﬂare emission in various electro-
magnetic passbands (Priest & Forbes 2002). Diﬀerent
from those ideal MHD mechanisms that suppose a pre-
existing MFR, the tether-cutting reconnection forms the
nascent MFR in the slow rise phase, which further grows
up in the acceleration phase, while the breakout recon-
nection does not build up the MFR until in the acceler-
ation phase.

Owing to the important role of the MFR in the
CME/ﬂare dynamics, the solar community has been
searching for the observational evidence of the MFR. In
solar active regions (ARs), forward or reversed sigmoidal
emission pattern in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft
X-ray (SXR) passbands is often seen as a progenitor of
the CME (e.g., Rust & Kumar 1996; Canﬁeld et al. 1999;
Sterling et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2007; McKenzie & Canﬁeld
2008; Liu et al. 2010; Savcheva et al. 2012b), thus be-
ing considered as evidence of the MFR preexisting in the
corona. On the other hand, ﬁlaments correspond to a col-
lection of relatively dense and cool plasma suspended at
dips of a helical structure; thus, ﬁlaments also serve as an
indicator of the MFR (Mackay et al. 2010). If there are
no ﬁlament materials, the helical MFR structure proba-
bly appears as dark ﬁlament channels along the polarity
inversion line (PIL) as been visible in the EUV pass-
bands (van Ballegooijen et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2014c).
When rotating to the solar limb, the cross section of ﬁl-
ament channels will manifest as dark cavities. The fre-
quently observed spinning motions (Low & Hundhausen
1995; Gibson et al. 2004; Wang & Stenborg 2010; Li et al.
2012), bright ring (Dove et al. 2011), and “lagomorphic”
structure of linear polarization (Bak-St¸e´slicka et al. 2013)
in the cavities, are even thought to be direct evidence of
the existence of helical magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, the
descending motion of ﬁlament materials along a helical
trajectory is also argued to be strong evidence of a heli-
cal structure (e.g., Li & Zhang 2013b; Cheng et al. 2014c;
Yang et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015). The intrinsic rela-
tionship between ﬁlaments and MFRs has further been
supported by various case studies, in which the dips of
the twisted ﬁeld lines reproduced by the non-linear force
free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation basically conform with
the ﬁlament locations (e.g., Guo et al. 2010b; Savcheva
et al. 2012b; Su & van Ballegooijen 2012; Cheng et al.
2013b; Inoue et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2014a,b, 2016; Yan
et al. 2015).

Recently, Cheng et al. (2011) presented unambiguous
evidence of an MFR being formed in the lower corona
(also see; Song et al. 2014a,b). It manifests as an EUV
blob in the high temperature passbands of the Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012). In

the other low temperature passbands, however, it ap-
pears as a dark cavity. Subsequently, Zhang et al. (2012)
and Cheng et al. (2013a) unveiled that, if seen oﬀ the
solar limb, the MFR will take on a coherent channel-
like hot structure that exists prior to the eruption (also
see; Patsourakos et al. 2013; Li & Zhang 2013a,c; Tri-
pathi et al. 2013; Chintzoglou et al. 2015; Joshi et al.
2015; Cheng et al. 2015). Once the hot channel takes oﬀ,
it gradually evolves to a semicircular loop-like structure
in the early rise phase. Afterwards, the loop-like struc-
ture quickly drives the formation of the CME and gives
rise to the ﬂare emission simultaneously. Furthermore,
through a detailed case study, Cheng et al. (2014c) iden-
tiﬁed that the hot channel can evolve smoothly from the
inner into the outer corona by retaining its coherence,
whose morphology coincides with the CME cavity in the
white-light images. Moreover, Cheng et al. (2014a) and
Chen et al. (2014a) documented that the hot channel is
initially cospatial with but later on separates from the
associated prominence. At the later time, the promi-
nence only occupies the lower part of the hot channel
spatially. Nindos et al. (2015) further made a statistical
study on the appearance frequency of the hot structures
and found that almost half of major eruptive ﬂares con-
tain a hot blob or channel-like conﬁguration. All of these
studies support the arguement that the EUV hot blobs
and channels are actually the helical MFRs that exist
prior to the eruption.

Therefore, it can be said that the EUV hot channels
can now be regarded as the most promising evidence
of the MFRs. However, previous studies on the MFRs
are mostly restricted to their morphology or kinematics,
while no attention is paid to the properties of their foot-
points. This is mainly due to that it is extremely diﬃcult
to ﬁnd out appropriate hot channels events, in which the
footpoints can be identiﬁed unambiguously. In the cur-
rent study, by inspecting tens of solar eruption events,
we ﬁnd out four hot channels events which are well ob-
served and have the discernable footpoints. Furthermore,
we detailedly investigate various characteristics at the
footpoints of the MFRs, as well as their relation to the
ﬂare ribbons. On the other hand, Aulanier et al. (2012)
and Janvier et al. (2013) recently extended the two-
dimensional (2D) standard CME/ﬂare model (CSHKP;
Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp
& Pneuman 1976) to 3D, which predicts the vertical
straightening of the inner legs of the CME and the trans-
fer of the magnetic shear from strong to weak after the
eruption. Thus, the revealed observational characteris-
tics can also be used to compare and validate the 3D
CME/ﬂare model.
In Section 2, we introduce the ob-
serving instruments, followed by the event selection in
Section 3. In Section 4, we display the results. Finally,
we give a summary and discussions in Section 5.

INSTRUMENTS

The data sets used in this study are primarily from
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).
The AIA on board SDO provides images of the solar
corona that are acquired almost simultaneously at tem-
peratures ranging from 0.06 MK to 20 MK through 9
passbands (7 EUV and 2 UV passbands) with a temporal
cadence of 12 s or 24 s and spatial resolution of 1.2(cid:48)(cid:48). The
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al.

2012) also on board SDO observes the photosphere at
6173 ˚A and provide light-of-sight magnetograms of the
full disk with a temporal cadence of 45 s and spatial reso-
lution of 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48). The vector magnetograms are provided by
HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs; Bobra et al. 2014)
product, in which the 180◦ ambiguity in the transverse
component has been removed. Moreover, we take advan-
tage of the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph
(LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board Solar and He-
liospheric Observatory (SOHO) and GOES to inspect
CMEs and monitor the soft X-ray (SXR) 1–8 ˚A ﬂux of
the associated ﬂares, respectively.

3. EVENT SELECTION
In order to investigate the footpoints of MFRs, we
search for appropriate events from the ISEST Event
List1. The selection criteria are:
(1) A hot channel-
like structure, which is believed to be the proxy of the
MFR (Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2013a), can be
clearly seen prior to the eruption in the AIA 131 and 94
˚A passbands; (2) The source regions of hot channels are
near the disk center so as to avoid the projection eﬀect
of magnetic ﬁeld measurement; (3) The corresponding
interplanetary CMEs have clear magnetic cloud struc-
tures when arriving at the Earth and produce geomag-
netic storms; and (4) The magnitude of the associated
ﬂares is ≥M1.0, which ensures that the footpoints of the
MFRs have enough intensity so that their locations can
be tracked precisely.

Four events are found to ﬁt the above criteria as shown
in Table 1. One can see that the four ﬂares have a long
rise time (>20 minutes) and a large magnitude (>M6.0),
and that the four CMEs are full halo ones with velocities
of >800 km s−1. Figure 1 shows the long-term evolu-
tion of the positive and negative magnetic ﬂuxes in their
source ARs. We ﬁnd that all eruptions appear in the
decay phase of the ARs but at their early stage. Note
that, for the SOL2013-04-11T event, the increase of the
positive and negative ﬂuxes is due to the emergence of a
second bipolar that appears in the northwest of the main
bipolar. Moreover, we can see that in a long period, at
least one day, before and after the eruption, there is no
other big event taking place, which shows that the mag-
netic environment of the four eruptions is not inﬂuenced
by other major eruptions.

4. RESULTS
4.1. Morphology of the MFRs
We ﬁnd that prior to the eruption, the most apparent
feature appearing in the four ARs is a curved cylinder
or writhed channel-like structure as seen in the AIA 131
˚A and 94 ˚A images. From Figure 2–9, one can see that
all of the channels take on a forward (SOL2012-07-12T
and SOL2014-04-18T events) or reversed (SOL2013-04-
11T and SOL2014-09-10T events) sigmoidal shape when
approaching the eruption, at least in its early phase.
Whereas in the AIA 171 ˚A passband, the ARs mainly
display the overlying loops that straddle over and are al-
most perpendicular to the channels. The channels most
likely contain plasmas of high temperatures since they
only appear in the AIA high temperature passbands and

are almost invisible in other low temperature passbands.
Actually, the detailed diﬀerential emission measure anal-
yses, which have been applied to the SOL2012-07-12T
and SOL2013-04-11T events by Cheng et al. (2014b) and
Vemareddy & Zhang (2014), respectively, proved that
the channels do have a high temperature of ≥8 MK.
Because of the high temperature property, Zhang et al.
(2012) and Cheng et al. (2013a) named the curved cylin-
der or writhed channel structures as EUV hot channels.
It is worth noting that, although the ARs often take on
a sigmoidal shape in the EUV and/or soft X-ray images,
it does not mean that the magnetic ﬁeld lines there must
be continuously sigmoidal threads (Titov & D´emoulin
1999; Kliem et al. 2004; Valori et al. 2010; Schmieder
et al. 2015; Jiang & Feng 2016). Alternatively, there
could be two groups of sheared arcades, making up a
sigmoidal shape as a whole (e.g., Rust & Kumar 1996;
Canﬁeld et al. 1999; McKenzie & Canﬁeld 2008; Liu et al.
2010). However, the latter explanation is not appropriate
for the four hot channels studied here, because they are
mostly comprised of continuously sigmoidal threads for
the reasons stated in detail below.

As for the SOL2012-07-12T case, Cheng et al. (2014b)
studied the formation of the hot channel-like MFR in de-
tail and found that the twisted ﬁeld lines have been well
built up a half day before the eruption. Furthermore,
they found that, two hours before the eruption, the whole
sigmoid actually is a double-decker MFR structure; the
low-lying one is manifested by the ﬁlament and the high-
lying one is evidenced by the strongly writhed channel-
like structure (Figure 2). With the ﬂare beginning, it
is clearly seen that the high-lying channel detach from
the sigmoidal AR with the middle part moving toward
the south. The high-lying hot channel being an MFR is
also proved by Dud´ık et al. (2014) with the MHD simula-
tion, in which they showed that the high-lying sigmoidal
threads and their evolution are well reproduced by an
unstable MFR and its eruption process.

Figure 3 presents the early evolution of the SOL2013-
04-11T sigmoid (also see the attached online movie of
Figure 7). One can see that a reversed sigmoid ﬁrst ap-
pears in the core ﬁeld of the source AR. From ∼06:45
UT, part of the S-shaped ﬁeld lines start to detach from
the sigmoid and then slowly rise up with the middle part
having the fastest speed. After ten minutes, the S-shaped
ﬁeld lines show an M-shape, which quickly evolves into
a semicircular shape. This similar evolution behavior
to the SOL2011-03-08T event analyzed by Zhang et al.
(2012) and Cheng et al. (2013a) strongly suggests that
the erupted S-shaped threads are actually the MFR (also
see, Vemareddy & Zhang 2014).

For the SOL2014-04-18T event, the forward sigmoidal
channel appears as early as one hour before the erup-
tion. Thanks to the high resolution of the AIA, we can
see that the channel structure mainly consists of a group
of coherently sigmoidal threads (Figure 4). Through an-
alyzing the IRIS spectral lines formed in the transition
region and the chromosphere and the HMI magnetic ﬁeld
in the photosphere, Cheng et al. (2015) concluded that
the formation of the continuously sigmoidal threads in
the hot channel is mainly via tether-cutting reconnec-
tion in the chromosphere, which gradually transforms
the sheared arcades into twisted ﬁeld lines prior to the
eruption. Joshi et al. (2015) also studied this event but

4

mostly focused on the ﬂare. They found that the be-
ginning of the ﬂare is triggered by the eruption of the
pre-existing sigmoidal hot channel, which is also identi-
ﬁed as the MFR (see their Figure 3).

The SOL2014-09-10T hot channel is slightly diﬀerent
from the above three ones. The sigmoidal emission pat-
tern of the source AR is mostly a result of two groups
of sheared arcades, which manifest a sigmoid as a whole
(Figure 5). However, through further checking the prop-
erty of the magnetic ﬁeld at the sigmoid center in the
period of ﬁve hours before the eruption, Cheng et al.
(2015) found that magnetic reconnection has been play-
ing a role in transforming part of sheared arcades into
longer threads. Recently, using Grad-Rubin method,
Zhao et al. (2016) extrapolated the 3D NLFFF ﬁeld of
the AR two hours before the eruption and also found
that some twisted ﬁeld lines are comparable with the sig-
moidal loops with, though, a small twist number (∼1.5).
Actually, in the early phase of the eruption, we do see
a set of continuously sigmoidal threads that detach from
the source sigmoidal AR and then erupt outward.

By carefully inspecting the orientation of the four hot
channels, we also ﬁnd that it has some deviation from
that of the main PILs of the ARs (red dashed lines in Fig-
ure 6f–9f). It indicates that the hot channels are most
likely located in the corona with a large separation in
altitude from the PILs of the source ARs in the photo-
sphere. Owing to the projection eﬀect, the SOL2013-04-
11T (SOL2014-04-18T) hot channel in the ARs located
at N07E13 (S20W34) deviates from the PIL toward the
east (west). Moreover, in the events except the SOL2014-
04-18T one, the ﬁlaments appear to lie nicely along the
main PILs as seen in the AIA 304 ˚A images. Interest-
ingly, during the CME eruptions, the ﬁlaments do not
erupt. It shows again that the erupted hot channels are
magnetic structures diﬀerent from the source sigmoids
and ﬁlaments.

To sum up, we can say that, although the four sigmoids
seen in the EUV images may be comprised of two groups
of sheared arcades, the hot channels should be the MFRs
since they have ascended to a certain height in the corona
and thus separated from the sigmoids, at least in the slow
rise phase. Taking advantage of the AIA 131 ˚A and 94
˚A images, we identify and depict the boundaries of the
four hot channel-like MFRs, as shown (yellow lines) in
Figures 6–9.

From Figure 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, and Table 2, we ﬁnd that
all of hot channels have a similar footpoint separation
distance. We introduce a parameter R, the ratio of the
projected length of the hot channels to the footpoint sep-
aration, to roughly estimate the writhe of the axis of the
hot channels. The projected lengths of the four channels,
which actually are the lower limit of the real lengths,
range from 183 to 312 Mm. They are much larger than
the separation distances (67–80 Mm) of the two foot-
points. It indicates that the hot channels not only detach
from the PILs but also have a signiﬁcant writhe. One can
see that the SOL2012-07-12T and SOL2013-04-11T hot
channels have a very large R, indicating a strong writhe,
in addition to the twist in the threads of the hot channels
(Figures 6 and 7). By contrast, the SOL2014-04-18T and
SOL2014-09-10T hot channels have a relatively small R,
which is consistent with a weak writhe in the correspond-
ing threads (Figures 8 and 9).

4.2. Overall Properties of Source Regions of the MFRs
We ﬁrst study the magnetic properties of the ARs that
host the hot channels. Here we use the HARP cylindrical
equal-area vector ﬁeld data (Figures 11a, 13a, 15a, and
17a), in which the magnetic ﬁeld, B, has been remapped
to a lambert cylindrical equal-area projection, i.e., the
Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic Cartesian coordinate system,
and includes projection correction and geometric mod-
iﬁcation (Sun 2013). Based on the Amp`ere’s law, the
vertical current density can be calculated through jz =
(∇ × B)z/µ0, where µ0=4π×10−3 G m A−1. Note that,
in order to avoid the eﬀect of noise in the weak ﬁelds,
the calculation is only done for Bz >50 G. Moreover, as-
suming that the uncertainty in the transverse ﬁeld Bt is
∼100 G, following the formula δjz = δBt/(µ0δx) (Gary
& Demoulin 1995), the error of jz is estimated to be of
the order of 0.02 A m−2. We also compare the values
of jz calculated from the HARP data with that calcu-
lated from the vector data that are reverted with the
UNNOFIT code (Janvier et al. 2014), which are shown
to be almost the same.

Figures 11b, 13b, 15b, and 17b show the distribution of
the vertical current density in the ARs. We ﬁnd that the
strongest current density always appears near the PILs,
in particular for the SOL2012-07-12T and SOL2014-09-
10T events. This is consistent with previous studies,
which stated that magnetic free energy is mainly stored
there (e.g., Sun et al. 2012). Moreover, the strong cur-
rent density at the PILs also indicates that magnetic
reconnection probably occurs there, which converts the
sheared arcades into the twist ﬁeld so as to form the
MFRs (e.g., Cheng et al. 2014b; Vemareddy & Zhang
2014). However, it should be noticed that those currents
seem not to be related to the erupted hot channels. For
example, in the SOL2012-07-12T, SOL2013-04-11T, and
SOL2014-04-18T events, the ﬁlaments, which usually de-
note the locations with strong currents along the PILs,
do not erupt following the eruption of the hot channels.
Figures 11c, 13c, 15c, and 17c show the distribution of
the inclination angle in the ARs. One can see that the in-
clination angle increases from the sunspot center to out-
ward and reaches its maximum in the penumbra. This
conforms with the canopy-type conﬁguration of ARs.
Moreover, along the PILs, the inclination angle is also
large, which is, however, due to the shear of the mag-
netic ﬁeld, as shown in Figures 11a, 13a, 15a, and 17a.
Due to the oppositely directed movements of magnetic
footpoints (see attached online movies), the original po-
tential ﬁeld become more and more sheared, thus causing
the large inclination angle.

Previous studies found that, in well-isolated ARs, the
net current In (the sum of direct current Id and return
current Ir) over the positive polarity is qual to that over
the negative one, i.e., the total current over the whole
ARs is close to zero (Wheatland et al. 2000; Georgoulis
et al. 2012). However, whether the net current over one
polarity is also close to zero is debated. Here, we also
tentatively calculate the net current over one polarity in
the four ARs. Note that, for the forward sigmoidal ARs,
which usually have a right-handed twist, the direct (re-
turn) current is parallel (antiparallel) with the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld; while for the reversed sigmoidal
ARs that usually have a left-handed twist, the direct (re-

turn) current is antiparallel (parallel) with the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld (Rust & Kumar 1996; Green et al.
2007; T¨or¨ok et al. 2014). The results are shown in Table
2, from which one can see that for the SOL2012-07-12T
and SOL2014-09-10T cases, the net current signiﬁcantly
deviates from zero. While for the SOL2013-04-11T and
SOL2014-04-18T cases, the net current almost vanishes.

4.3. Magnetic Properties of Footpoints of the MFRs
We consider the two ends of the hot channels as the
footpoints of the MFRs (From Figures 6f, 7f, 8f, and
9f). We ﬁnd that the two footpoints do not overlap the
two ends of the main PILs. The fact is that, for all of
hot channels, one footpoint comes from the moss region
near the following sunspot, while the other one stems
from the penumbra (SOL2014-04-18T) or penumbra edge
(SOL2012-07-12T, SOL2013-04-11T, and SOL2014-09-
10T) of the preceding sunspot.
In the moss region,
the magnetic ﬁeld is weaker and the inclination angle
is smaller; while in the penumbra and penumbra edge,
the magnetic ﬁeld is stronger and the inclination angle
is larger.

It is noticed that the strong currents appear not only
near the PILs, but also at the footpoints of the hot chan-
nels with the relatively strong magnetic ﬁeld (Figures
11b, 13b, 15b, and 17b), the latter of which may be re-
lated to the currents of the MFRs. For the SOL2012-07-
12T, SOL2014-04-18T, and SOL2014-09-10T (SOL2013-
04-11T) events, at the positive (negative) footpoints,
there always appears a dominated direct current. More-
over, we ﬁnd that the distribution of the direct cur-
rent takes on a curled shape on a large scale, which
is surrounded by some sporadic return current, in par-
ticular for the SOL2012-07-12T (Figure 11b and 11h),
SOL2013-04-11T (Figure 13b and 13h), and SOL2014-
09-10T events (Figure 17b and 17h) (also see, Janvier
et al. 2014).

In order to calculate the average magnetic ﬁeld
strength, average inclination angle, direct currents, and
return currents at the footpoints, we choose two square
regions with their centers determined from the ends of
the hot channels but slightly shifted so as to cover most
of the brightenings at the ends of the hot channels in the
early rise phase as seen in the AIA 304 ˚A and 1600 ˚A
passbands. The size of the square is set to be 30(cid:48)(cid:48)×30(cid:48)(cid:48)(22
Mm×22 Mm), which is big enough to contain all of the
footpoints of the hot channels. On the other hand, such
a size is also small enough for the sake of avoiding the in-
ﬂuence of the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld. Furthermore,
we also compare the selected regions with the synthe-
sized ﬂare ribbons, which are derived through summing
up all ﬂare ribbons in the period of the early phase of
the ﬂares. We ﬁnd that for each event, the two selected
regions basically cover the hooks of the two J-shaped
ﬂare ribbons, in particular, the ribbons with stronger
magnetic ﬁelds (Figure 10). Finally, it is needed to de-
termine the locations of the footpoints in the coordinate
system of the HARPs data. Here, this is done by means
of co-aligning the same magnetic features of the foot-
points in the light-of-sight magentograms with that in the
vertical component of the HARPs vector magnetograms.
It is worth noticing that the real size (30(cid:48)(cid:48)×30(cid:48)(cid:48)) of the
two square regions in the light-of-sight magnetograms
is slightly larger than the size (22 Mm×22 Mm) of the

5

corresponding two square regions in the HARPs vector
magnetograms because the former has a projection eﬀect.
However, we vary the center and/or size of the region by
within ±5 Mm as a test and do not ﬁnd that our re-
sults are inﬂuenced qualitatively although the values of
magnetic parameters are changed slightly. Note that, for
the SOL2012-07-12T and SOL2014-09-10 events, there
appears a secondary ribbon (Zhang et al. 2014) that ex-
tends from the tip of the hook (arrows in Figure 10).
With the development of the ﬂare, it further propagates
toward a particular direction, forming a long and slender
ribbon-like structure (see the attached online movies of
Figure 6 and 9).

Table 2 shows the magnetic properties at the two re-
gions where the hot channels root in. We ﬁnd that at
the footpoints with stronger magnetic ﬁelds, the aver-
age inclination angle tends to be larger with the maxi-
mal (minimal) value being 45◦ (23◦). The direct current
there is calculated to be of the order of 1012 A. While
at the footpoints with weaker magnetic ﬁelds, the aver-
age inclination angle tends to be smaller with the max-
imal (minimal) value being 34◦ (18◦). The direct and
return current is distributed nearly uniformly without
obvious concentrations in some speciﬁc regions. Only for
the SOL2012-07-12T event, the direct current there is
comparable in quantity to that at the footpoints with
stronger magnetic ﬁelds. One may expect that, the di-
rect current ﬂowing into the MFRs from one footpoint
should ﬂow out from the other, or that the direct cur-
rent at the footpoints with weaker magnetic ﬁelds should
be roughly equal to that at the footpoints with stronger
magnetic ﬁelds. However, the real situation is compli-
cated. Some potential reasons that cause the direct cur-
rent at the footpoints with weaker magnetic ﬁelds signif-
icantly deviating from that at the other ones probably
include: (1) the measurement of the vector ﬁeld is not
precise enough in the weak ﬁeld region, which leads to
a relatively large uncertainty in the current calculation
there, and (2) the magnetic ﬁeld strength is diﬀerent at
two diﬀerent polarities, which requires that the sizes of
regions for integrating the direct currents are also dif-
ferent to ensure the magnetic ﬂux balance. However,
observationally, the real sizes of the regions that contain
the entire footpoints of MFRs can hardly be determined
accurately.

We also study the evolution of the average magnetic
ﬁeld strength, average inclination angle, and direct cur-
rent at the two footpoints during the eruptions of the
hot channels (Figures 12, 14, 16, and 18). The average
magnetic ﬁeld strength has no signiﬁcant change with
the eruptions, as a consequence of no obvious ﬂux emer-
gence or magnetic cancellation appearing. However, we
ﬁnd that the average inclination angle at most of the foot-
points tends to decrease. For example, at the two foot-
points of the SOL2013-04-11T and SOL2014-04-18T hot
channels, the inclination angle signiﬁcantly decreases.
While the inclination angle only slightly decreases at
the footpoints of the SOL2014-09-10T hot channel and
it even increases at the footpoint of the SOL2012-07-12T
hot channel with positive magnetic polarity. We suspect
that such an increase is the result of the rapid rotation
of the preceding sunspot (see Figure 7 of Cheng et al.
2014b), which compensates for the decrease of the incli-
nation angle caused by the eruption of the hot channel.

6

Moreover, we also ﬁnd that the direct current at all of
the footpoints with stronger magnetic ﬁelds experiences
an obvious decrease (Figures 12c, 14c, 16c, and 18c).
These features indicate that the magnetic ﬁeld emanat-
ing from the footpoints tends to become more straight
and less twisted after the eruptions. This is reasonable
because the legs of the hot channel-like MFRs are gradu-
ally stretched and straightened. At the same time, such
a stretching causes an increase of the length of the hot
channels. However, due to the conservation of the total
twist, the twist per unit length just decreases, leading to
the reduction of the direct current.

4.4. Evolution of Footpoints of the MFR Eruptions
The detailed kinematical studies suggest that the
MFRs play an important role in forming the CMEs and
producing the ﬂare emission (Cheng et al. 2013a,b; Sun
et al. 2015). However, during the MFR eruption, the
detailed evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in the MFR and
its relation to the ambient ﬁeld are still unknown.
In
this Section, we pay our attention to the chromospheric
brightenings caused by the four erupted hot channels, in
particular studying their evolution and relation to ﬂare
ribbons.

During the eruptions, the overall evolution of the chro-
mospheric brightenings can be divided into three stages.
The ﬁrst stage occurs in the slow rise phase. The bright-
enings sporadically appear at the footpoints and in the
regions below the two elbows of the hot channels (panels
a, d, and g of Figure 19–22). It indicates that some pre-
heating probably has started, most likely taking place
within the threads of the hot channels or between the
hot channels and the ambient sheared arcades.

The second stage of chromospheric brightenings starts
with the beginning of the impulsive acceleration of the
hot channels, also the early rise phase of the ﬂare (pan-
els b, e, and h of Figure 19–22). The brightenings at the
two footpoints ﬁrst extend outward, forming a hook-like
shape. At the same time, the brightenings also propa-
gate along the main PILs with opposite orientations at
two diﬀerent polarities. Quickly, two slender ribbon-like
brightenings come into being, taking on sheared double-
J shape, the straight parts of which are adjacent to each
other on either side of the PILs and the two hooks face on
each other at the opposite ends. Such characters are es-
pecially apparent for the SOL2013-04-11T and SOL2014-
04-18T events. For the SOL2012-07-12T and SOL2014-
09-10T events, the J ribbon in the negative polarity is
much larger than that in the positive polarity, which is
primarily due to that the magnetic ﬁeld is very strong
there and thus the brightenings only propagate with a
relatively short distance.

The third stage happens in the later rise and decay
phase of the ﬂare (panels c, f, and i of Figure 19–22).
The primary characteristics are the separation of the two
slender ribbons and the gradual disappearance of the two
hooks. From the attached online movies of Figures 6–9,
one can clearly see that the two straight parts of the J
ribbons expand outward with opposite directions but al-
most perpendicular to the PILs. Based on the CSHKP
model, such a separation is mainly caused by the sys-
tematic ascending of the reconnection site in the corona.
Moreover, from the second to third stage, we ﬁnd that
the two straight parts of the double J structure evolve

from greatly sheared to almost parallelized (less sheared).
This is most likely the consequence of the ﬂare reconnec-
tion that proceeds from the strongly sheared overlying
ﬁeld at a low site to a nearly potential one at a high site
(Aulanier et al. 2012; Janvier et al. 2013).

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we investigate the magnetic properties
of four erupted hot channel-like MFRs that initially ap-
pear as forward or reversed sigmoidal structures prior
to the eruption as seen in the AIA 131 and 94 ˚A pass-
bands. Thanks to the high resolution of the AIA, the
continuously sigmoidal threads that comprise the coher-
ent and sigmoidal channels can be seen to detach from
the source sigmoidal ARs and then erupt to become the
CMEs. The ratio of the projected length of the hot chan-
nels to their footpoint separation distance ranges from
2.3 to 4.0, showing that the magnetic ﬁelds in the hot
channels have a strong writhe.

The axis of the hot channels signiﬁcantly deviates from
the main PILs and associated ﬁlaments prior to the erup-
tion. It shows that the channels have ascended to a high
altitude in the corona and been likely separated from that
of the ﬁlaments when approaching the eruptions. Us-
ing the optimization algorithm (Wheatland et al. 2000;
Wiegelmann 2004), we also extrapolate the 3D NLFFF
structures in the four ARs. Unfortunately, we could not
reproduce the ﬁeld lines that ﬁt spatially with the hot
channels. The reasons could be the insuﬃcient resolution
of magnetic ﬁeld measurement, in particular at the foot-
points of the hot channels (Cheng et al. 2014b), or the
preprocessing over-smoothes the vector ﬁeld before doing
the extrapolation. Moreover, the observed vector magne-
tograms often contain signiﬁcant Lorentz and buoyancy
forces, which actually do not satisfy the NLFFF assump-
tion (De Rosa et al. 2009), thus challenging the reliabil-
ity of extrapolated structures. At present, the potential
method that is likely able to reproduce the magnetic ﬁeld
resembling the hot channels is the MFR insertion method
developed by van Ballegooijen (2004), which inserts an
MFR into the potential ﬁeld and then perform a relax-
ation to ﬁt the observations (e.g., Su & van Ballegooijen
2012; Su et al. 2015; Savcheva et al. 2012b,a, 2015). In a
follow up work, we plan to utilize this method to model
the structures of the four ARs and then compare the
results with observations. We will also try the promis-
ing Grad-Rubin method, which has been applied to the
SOL2014-09-10 event by Zhao et al. (2016) and repro-
duced twisted ﬁeld lines that are comparable with the
sigmoidal threads of the hot channel.

Through comparing the AIA 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A images
and HMI light-of-sight magnetograms, we ﬁnd that one
footpoint of the hot channels originates in the penumbra
or penumbra edge while the other one is from the moss
region. Such an observational fact can be compared with
various numerical models. In the simulations of a pre-
existing MFR emerging into the potential magnetic ar-
cades (e.g., Fan & Gibson 2004; Fan 2010; Leake et al.
2013), the two footpoints of the MFR are exactly located
at the centers of two diﬀerent polarities. The situation is
somewhat diﬀerent in the simulations by Aulanier et al.
(2010) and Amari et al. (2010), in which an initially po-
tential and asymmetric bipolar ﬁeld evolves by means of
the shearing motions along the main PIL. The ﬂux can-

cellation in a bald-patch and/or the reconnection in a
quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) transform the sheared ar-
cades into continuously sigmoidal ﬁeld, ﬁnally forming
an MFR. The footpoints of the MFRs are located at the
outer boundaries of the two polarities while the axis of
the MFRs is basically parallel to the main PIL. Recently,
Amari et al. (2014) performed a cutting-edge data-driven
simulation and completely reproduce that one footpoint
of the MFR is located at the edge of the positive polar-
ity and the other one stems from the moss region nearby
the negative polarity. Unfortunately, for the event they
modeled, there are no AIA observations; thus it is dif-
ﬁcult to compare the magnetic ﬁeld lines with the hot
channels.

We ﬁnd that the net currents in SOL2012-07-12T and
SOL2014-09-10T ARs signiﬁcantly deviate from zero,
but in the SOL2013-04-11T and SOL2014-04-18T ARs
they almost vanish. Nevertheless, at the footpoints of
the four hot channels, we always see a dominated di-
rect current. It indicates that the direct currents in the
MFRs are always larger than the return currents irre-
spective of whether the currents in their source ARs are
neutralized or not. In the ARs with signiﬁcant non-zero
net currents, the MFRs may be directly originated from
the net currents; while in ARs with almost neutralized
net currents, some opposite currents possibly exist else-
where and can counteract the currents of the MFRs when
integrating the net currents over the entire polarity. In
fact, in many CME/ﬂare initiation models (e.g., Titov &
D´emoulin 1999; van Ballegooijen 2004; T¨or¨ok & Kliem
2005; Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Savcheva et al. 2012b), the
existence of the MFR-associated current is required; one
can see a current that comes out from one footpoint of
the MFR and returns to the other one. However, it is
worth noting that the direct currents at the footpoints
with weaker magnetic ﬁeld are almost one order of mag-
nitude smaller than that at the footpoints with stronger
magnetic ﬁeld. This is somewhat diﬀerent from the result
of Janvier et al. (2014), in which both of the footpoints
of the erupted MFR originate in the regions with very
strong magnetic ﬁeld and exhibit comparative direct cur-
rents. Such a distinction may be due to the fact that, in
our cases, the measurement of the vector magnetic ﬁeld
at the footpoints where the magnetic ﬁeld is weak seems
not to be accurate enough, which may lead to a relatively
large uncertainty in the current calculation.

We study the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld at the
footpoints of the hot channels. The average magnetic
ﬁeld strength does not change apparently with the erup-
tions going on. However, the average inclination angle
at most of the footpoints has a decrease. The direct
current at all of the footpoints with stronger magnetic
ﬁeld also experiences a decrease. At ﬁrst glance, these
results seem to conﬂict with the previous results that
the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld near the PIL becomes
more horizontal (Wang & Liu 2010, 2015; Wang et al.
2012; Liu et al. 2012), implying an increase of the inclina-
tion angle there, and the direct current tends to increase
slightly after the eruptions (Janvier et al. 2014). We ar-
gue that the diﬀerent results may refer to the diﬀerent
physical processes that occur at diﬀerent locations. With
the MFR erupting upward, the magnetic ﬁeld rooted in
the two ends should be stretched to be more and more
vertical. Meanwhile, due to the total twist conservation,

7

the twist per unit length decreases. This results in a
decrease of both the inclination angle and the direct cur-
rent. By contrast, the magnetic ﬁeld near the PIL is
ﬁrst stretched upward and then reconnects. Afterwards,
the reconnected ﬁeld lines shrink toward the photosphere
due to magnetic tension, thus leading to an increase in
the inclination angle. However, as for the increase of the
direct current near the main PIL, it is possibly a result
of magnetic reconnection or due to some other unknown
mechanisms.

We also investigate the chromospheric brightenings at
the footpoints of the hot channel-like MFRs, as well as
their evolution and relation to ﬂare ribbons. The overall
evolution of the chromospheric brightenings is comprised
of three stages. The brightenings in the ﬁrst stage ap-
pear in the slow rise phase and is located at the two foot-
points, as well as in the regions below the two elbows of
the hot channels. The brightenings at the second stage
take on a double J shape with the two hooks at the oppo-
site ends corresponding to the extended footpoints. Once
entering the third stage, the two straight parts of dou-
ble J-ribbons start to separate from each other, evolving
from two sheared slender ribbons into parallel widened
ones.

The evolution of the chromospheric brightenings pro-
vides a perspective on the 3D evolution of the MFR,
which is illustrated by a schematic drawing as shown
in Figure 23.
In the slow rise stage, the reconnection
may take place inside the MFR or between the MFR
and its ambient strongly sheared ﬁeld. As a result, the
footpoints of the MFR and the strongly sheared ﬁeld
are heated, manifesting themselves as some sporadical
brightenings (Figure 23a). At the same time, the recon-
nection also produces an upward Lorentz force to lift the
MFR. Once the MFR ascends to a height where the de-
cline of the background ﬁeld is fast enough, kink and/or
torus instability will be set in (e.g., T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005;
Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Olmedo & Zhang 2010; Savcheva
et al. 2012a; Cheng et al. 2013b; Zuccarello et al. 2015;
Su et al. 2015). Then, the MFR accelerates upward non-
linearly. In the early acceleration stage (Figure 23b), the
overlying ﬁeld that straddles over the MFR is strongly
sheared. When these ﬁelds are stretched by the MFR
upward motion, their legs approach each other and then
reconnect, resulting in two sheared J-shaped brightenings
in the chromosphere. This result is consistent with previ-
ous ﬁndings that hard X-ray footpoint sources and post-
ﬂare loops sometimes display a strong shear in the initial
phase of the ﬂare (e.g., Su et al. 2007; Ji et al. 2008; Liu
et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2012). Actually, the two strongly
sheared J-shaped brightenings may represent the foot-
prints of the curved QSLs in the chormosphere as ex-
pected by the 3D standard CME/ﬂare model (Aulanier
et al. 2012; Janvier et al. 2013, 2014; Dudik et al. 2016).
Very recently, through calculating the QSLs in several
sigmoidal ARs, Savcheva et al. (2015) and Zhao et al.
(2016) conﬁrmed that the straight segments of the two
sheared J-ribbons are basically matched by the MFR-
related QSLs, thus approving the interpretation of the
reconnection between strongly sheared overlying ﬁeld in
the early phase of the eruption.

In the later acceleration stage (Figure 23c), the most
apparent evolution is the separation of two ﬂare rib-
bons. Since the MFR has risen to a relatively high al-

8

titude, the overlying ﬁeld is almost potential. When a
row of such overlying ﬁeld lines is stretched and then
reconnects, the heated footpoints will form two paral-
lel ribbon-like brightenings. With the MFR continu-
ously rising, the overlying ﬁeld being reconnected be-
comes higher and higher; correspondingly, the separa-
tion of their footpoints becomes larger and larger. As a
consequence, the increase in the reconnection height is
mapped as the separation of two ﬂare ribbons.

Note: F+ (F−) denotes magnetic ﬂux in the positive (negative) polarity of ARs. RF refers to the imbalance of magnetic ﬂuxes deﬁned
as (F++F−)/(F+–F−). sign[B] indicates the sign of the magnetic polarity where we calculate direct currents Id, return current Ir, and
net current In=Id+Ir. RI is the ratio of the net current to total unsigned current and deﬁned as In/(Id–Ir). The quantities l and d are
the projected length and footpoint separation of the hot channels, respectively, and R=l/d. ¯B− ( ¯B+), f− (f+ ), Id− (Id+), Ir− (Ir+),
In− (In+), and ¯θ− (¯θ+) represent average magnetic ﬁeld strength, magnetic ﬂux, direct current, return current, net current, and average
inclination angle at the negative (positive) footpoints of the four hot channels, respectively.

Fig. 1.— Temporal evolution of the positive ﬂux (blue), negative ﬂux (red), and total unsigned ﬂux (black) in the four MFR-hosting
ARs. The gray curves show the GOES SXR 1–8 ˚A ﬂuxes, in which the maximum peak in each panel corresponds to the ﬂare caused by
the erupted hot channels.

Fig. 23.— Schematic drawing of the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld involved in the MFR eruption (yellow). The overlying ﬁeld
(blue) straddling over the MFR transits from being strongly to weakly sheared with the increasing height. The brightenings (red) in the
chromosphere appear at the two footpoints of the MFR in the slow rise stage (a), then evolve into the sheared double J shape in the early
acceleration stage (b), and ﬁnally form two parallel ribbons in the later acceleration stage (c). The gray (black) patches display the positive
(negative) polarity of the AR with the small patches showing the moss region nearby.
