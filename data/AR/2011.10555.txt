RESUMEN

ABSTRACT
Within the scope of extended matter research, we present new spectral anal-
ysis results of an active binary system AR Lac. The low and high resolution
spectra of this system were taken during the period 2013-2016. The eval-
uation of low dispersion spectra together with the B, V, Rc, Ic and WISE
photometric data showed that AR Lac has an excess radiation in W2 band.
In addition, the spectral energy distribution and the minima depth ratios of
the light curves of this active binary system were studied to examine the ﬂux
contributions of the components of the system depending on wavelengths and
on orbital phase. Furthermore, high resolution spectral analysis showed ev-
idence of prominence-like structures and a possible extended matter around
the cooler component of AR Lac binary system.

1. INTRODUCTION

AR Lac (HD 210334, Vmax = 6.09, P = 1.98 days) is one of the bright and
totally eclipsing binary system of chromospherically active binaries (CABs).
This RS CVn type binary system has components of spectral type G2 IV
+ K0 IV. Lu et al. (2012) summarized the previous studies that had been
presented by numerous investigators, including photometric and spectroscopic
observations of AR Lac. This active binary system is well known to have
orbital period change, magnetic and spot activity which are aﬀecting the
cooler component together with strong emission features in Ca II H and K
lines (see Lu et al. 2012). A long-term secular period decrease was estimated
at a rate of dP/dt = −(2.128 ± 0.060) × 10−9d/d by Lu et al. (2012), which
may be caused by the magnetic activity of this active binary system. Based on
this result, they also gave an estimation on the mass-loss rate for this binary
system as dM/dt = −2.8 × 10−10M⊙yr−1.

The spectral Hα and Ca II H and K emission lines are very important in-
dicators of chromospheric or magnetic activity of the component(s) of CABs

(see Rodono 1980). Thus, the activity level of a star can also be inferred
by determining the presence of spectral Hα emission line or by determina-
tion of Hα with a core which was ﬁlled-in some absorption features (see
Fernandez-Figueroa et al. 1994; Barden 1985; Fekel et al. 1986; Bopp et al.
1988; Strassmeier et al. 1990).

In the studies of some CABs, it was found that there were some evidences
which indicate that the extended/circumstellar matter in that binary system
may exist (see Scaltriti et al. 1993).
In these studies the measurements of
the excess radiation, especially in the spectral region of long wavelengths of
active binary systems, were used with the respect to excess radiation, may
be caused by mass loss due to stellar winds, and which may related to ex-
tended/circumstellar matter.

Assessments of some important observational data of disk structure around
chromospherically active binary stars began with the infrared astronomical
satellite (IRAS) in 1983. IRAS was the ﬁrst mission to put a telescope in
space to survey the All Sky Survey at 12, 25, 60, and 100 micron bands
(Scaltriti et al. 1993). Based on IRAS observations, Busso et al. (1988) found
that IR excess is deﬁnitely present in CF Tuc, while the spectral distributions
of the λ And, UX Ari and AR Lac can be accounted for IR excess by combina-
tions of normal stellar components. They also concluded that the excess is not
correlated with the activity level nor with the evolutionary status but may be
correlated with the mass loss phenomena near the Main Sequence. Possible
interpretation of the excess emission based on the evolutionary status of the
binary components are also discussed by Busso et al. (1990). They discuss
possible explanations in terms of mass loss phenomena(triggered by the bi-
nary nature) during the evolution of the sources near the Main Sequence. The
behaviour of excess Ca II H and K and Hǫ emission in a sample of 73 (CABs),
including AR Lac, was examined by Montes et al. (1996), and they found that
there was a good correlation between excess Ca II K and Hǫ chromospheric
emission ﬂuxes.

In the Hα line study of the system Frasca et al. (2000) found that there
are chromospheric emissions from both components in most spectra and the
rotational modulation of Hα line emission is not obvious. They gave an in-
terpretation on the excess absorption observed in 1997 during and near the
primary minima as a comment for the eﬀect of a prominence like structure
anchored between the leading and trailing hemisphere of the cool component.
This interpretation was fully compatible with the radial velocities of Hα peaks
in extracted spectra. Zboril et al.
(2004) reported that the central depth of
Hα proﬁles of AR Lac at eclipses (at 0.041P and 0.043P) were deeper than
synthetic proﬁles and close to the proﬁles of stars with the same spectral
types(e.g. δ Eri).

Lanza et al. (1998) gave a detailed analysis of the long-term and seasonal
light curves of AR Lac. Based on their main results concerning the magnetic
activity of AR Lac binary system, they concluded that the large active region
around the substellar point on the secondary showed itself not only at pho-

tospheric levels but also in the chromosphere and corona, with an extended
structure which might well be an interconnecting loop between the two stars.

The results of Very Large Array (VLA) observations during optical eclipses

in 1977 of AR Lac were reported by Owen & Spangler (1977). They found
a small increase in radio ﬂux density during 0.5P, although the radio source
had variation on time scales ≥ a few hours, but they did not detect a strong
eclipse-like feature that occurs near 0.0P or 0.5P orbital phases. Together
with their spectral evaluations by taking into account the synchrotron self-
absorption, they suggested that the radiation is likely to be produced in a
volume much larger than the stars in the system due to the lack of clearly
deﬁned eclipse in the AR Lac binary system.

Simultaneous observations of AR Lac at radio and ultraviolet wavelengths
during two consecutive secondary eclipses, made in 1979 May, were reported
by Brown et al. (1979). During one of the eclipses they saw a quiescent radio
source without an evidence of an eclipse at radio wavelengths. On the second
one, they found the radio source was brighter by a factor of 3 together with an
evident radio eclipse. And, in the latter case, the radio source was circularly
polarized by 5-10% during eclipse. They also gave the following with the same
statements as follows:

- the sense of circular polarization change abruptly at ﬁrst contact, and

- the radio eclipse was twice as deep in one sense of circular polarization

as it was in the other.

They also identiﬁed the following features from their simultaneous ultraviolet
observations: The ultraviolet coronal lines also showed the eclipse. But, the
eclipse on the day in which the radio source was quiescent became much more
prominent than the eclipse on the day in which the radio source was active.
In other words, the eﬀect of eclipse on coronal ultraviolet lines increases while
the radio source is in quiescent state, but while the radio source is in an active
state the eﬀect of eclipse decreases and the eclipse becomes more uncertain.
Thus, this result is evident that coronal activity in the radio region increases
the brightness and this increase will not only be caused by stellar activity
because the brightness eﬀect of the radiation in ultraviolet region has not
been seen at the same time.

By using the Einstein Imaging Proportional Counter (IPC) observations
of the X-ray eclipse together with the cotemporal International Ultraviolet
Explorer (IUE) and radio observations, Walter et al. (1983) found an ex-
tended corona with a scale of about 1R∗ to be associated with the K0 IV
component of AR Lac binary system. They have obtained X-ray, radio, and
ultraviolet observations of the system over one orbital cycle. The primary
minimum of the X-ray light curve they obtained for AR Lac was deep and
the secondary minimum was broad and shallow. They found that quiescent
corona of the G2 IV component is small and asymmetric which extends to
some 0.02R∗ above the photosphere to be related with stellar spots. On

the other hand, the K0 IV component was found to have two coronal com-
ponents: 1- An outer, extended coronal component which is presumably a
hotter component that extends to 1R∗ above the photosphere and exhibits a
bright hemisphere, 2- An inner coronal component which is small relative to
the stellar radius.

Using their VLA observations at 1.5 and 4.9 GHz frequencies on 13 and
15 October 1982, Doiron & Mutel (1984) have not detected a clear eclipse
signature in the light curve of AR Lac. On both observing days, a signiﬁcant
circular polarization of 2%-8% was observed with a helicity reversal between
1.5 and 4.9 GHz, and they attributed this result to a gyro-synchrotron mech-
anism.

Using the IUE LWR and SWP spectra of AR Lac, obtained on 3-5 Octo-
ber 1983, and their VLA observation on 4-5 October 1983 at 2, 6, and 20 cm,
Walter et al. (1987) determined the atmospheric structure within the plage re-
gions together with the properties of the extended coronal component around
K0 IV star. They identiﬁed three discrete regions of emissions in the outer
atmosphere of the K0 IV star in which there are two ”plages” and a chromo-
spheric brightening that was related to a radio ﬂare.

Based on their results of the multifrequency VLA and Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA) observations, made in 1997, Trigilio et al. (2001) inferred the
conclusions as follows:

”- the spectral and spatial information of the corona of AR Lac indicate a
structured morphology, which can be modeled with a core-halo source;

- the physical parameters, as derived from the ﬁt of the observed spectra
with the core-halo model, are consistent with the hypothesis of a co-
spatial X-ray and radio source;

- the observed radio emission cannot be attributed to the same thermal

electron population responsible for the observed X-ray emission.”

Koch (2007) detected a variable polarization in the AR Lac. He reported
that the seat of the polarization could provisionally be located in the assorted
active clouds that populate the outer envelope of K0 IV component. Also, he
reported that the plasma must be low in metals compared to the Sun and
not have a simple polarization spectrum.
In this regard, he also gave the
following explanation: ”Since Z is about 0.6Z⊙, there is a possibility that the
metal depletion is only apparent and not real because the grain condensation
in the cool envelope and that grains alone are the seats of the polarization.”
Recently, a research on the extended/circumstellar matter in CABs has
been presented by Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020). Based on their photometric
CCD data of 13 CABs, including AR Lac and together with the 2MASS and
WISE data, they found that the AR Lac had some ﬂuctuations in colour ex-
cess (CE) values at around primary minimum. And, they also found that
the system showed some characteristic variations in CE values towards longer
wavelengths, at both around secondary minimum and outside eclipse but with

lower and some detectable CE values in all bands at outside eclipses. They
concluded that the main source of excess radiation in the AR Lac is stellar
activity. This stellar activity is expected to contribute to the formation of
an extended/circumstellar matter in the AR Lac, but a signiﬁcant evidence
on how much it contributes could not be presented by Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci
(2020), based solely on their results of photometric CE measurements.

In this study, the spectra of AR Lac taken during the observing period
2013-2016 at diﬀerent orbital phases by using the Coud´e Echelle and TFOSC
(Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) instruments were analysed to
investigate and to reveal the relationship between its stellar activity and a
possible extended/circumstellar matter of the system. In addition, together
with the results of this spectral analysis of the AR Lac system, an evaluation
was made by including the results given by Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020) based
on their photometric CCD, 2MASS and WISE data taken during minima and
outside eclipses. Within the scope of this evaluation, the B, V, Rc, Ic, and
W1, W2, W3, W4 of WISE band light curves of AR Lac were also taken into
consideration.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTIONS

Spectral observations of AR Lac were carried out at times to cover the
external and internal contact parts of the light curve of the system in the
eclipses together with descending and ascending parts. The choice of these
observation times corresponding to these orbital phases was made to see the
relationship of the system’s activity events with the characteristics of the com-
ponent stars on the disc edges and a possible extended/circumstellar matter.
For this purpose, both low and high resolution spectral data were used to
investigate the presence of a possible extended/circumstellar matter together
with the properties and evolutionary states of components of AR Lac.

For all low and high resolution spectra of this study, Image Reduction
and Analysis Facility (IRAF)2 was used to reduce the combined data with
standard procedures, including the corrections for ﬂat and bias, and determi-
nation of aperture, wavelength calibration, velocity correction, and interstellar
extinction/cosmic radiation. But, the atmospheric and interstellar extinction

eﬀects have only been corrected for low resolution spectra. The standard
stars selected and observed within the conditions of observability for ﬂux cal-
ibration are as follows: Vega (HR 7001, A0 V, V = 0.03) and HR 8634 (B8
V, V = 3.41). Standard ﬂux values for the stars are taken from the website
”https://snfactory.lbl.gov/snf/spstds/” and the references therein. In addi-
tion, the TFOSC spectra of the HR 5510 (M1 III, V = 6.28) reference star
were taken to see and evaluate the eﬀect of Telluric line absorptions on the
spectra of the AR Lac binary system. For Hα proﬁle analysis, the high res-
olution spectra of two reference stars which are of the same spectral type of
both components of the AR Lac binary system, were also taken. These two
stars are: HD 195405 (G2 IV) and HR 6256 (K0 IV).

In addition, photometric data, from Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020), of AR
Lac in Johnson-Cousins BVRcIc and medium WISE bands were used to make a
comparison with our spectroscopic results. In all these bands, the photometric
light curves of the AR Lac were also constructed and evaluated by using
the photometric colour excess measurements of Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020).
Some details about these photometric observational data are presented below
in Section 2.3.

2.1. Low Dispersion Spectra

The optical low resolution spectral observations of AR Lac, a reference
star(HR5510) and two standard stars(Vega and HR 8634) took place during
the observing period 2015-2016, by using the TUG (T ¨UB˙ITAK National Obser-
vatory) Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (TFOSC) mounted on the 1.5
m Russian Turkish Telescope RTT1503 in Antalya, Turkey. The log of TFOSC
observations are given in Table 1. Grism 15 was used with a 100 micron slit.
The wavelength range in this conﬁguration is 3230 − 9120˚A, and the resolving

power (R)∼749. Ar, Ne, He and Halogen lamp spectra taken in the same
night with the star were used for wavelength calibration and ﬂat-ﬁelding. A
total of 65 slit spectra were obtained: 30 of spectra were taken for AR Lac,
and the rest were spectra of other standard stars (see Table 1).

As can be seen from Figure 1, the low resolution TFOSC spectra have the
eﬀect of Telluric lines caused by water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide
molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere in the spectral range 6000 − 9000˚A, on
the continuum level. This eﬀect is larger in cold stars, especially in the pho-
tometric "Ic" band spectral region than in hotter stars.

In order to compare the obtained TFOSC spectra with a synthetic spec-
trum, the synthetic spectra were constructed by using the appropriate tem-
perature, surface acceleration and metal abundance values, taken from website
”http://svo2.cab.intacsic.es/theory/newov2/index.php”. Theoretical spectra
were obtained by using the ATLAS9 Kurucz ODFNEW/NOVER (Castelli et al.
1997) data in model with zero metal abundance. In constructing a model spec-
trum of AR Lac binary system, by using the ATLAS9 Kurucz ODFNEW/NOVER
model atmosphere, the related parameters were taken as:
For the G0 IV component; T (K) = 5750, logg = 4.0, and Z = 0,
For the K0 IV component; T (K) = 5000, logg = 3.5, and Z = 0.
The ﬂux contributions from both components of AR Lac binary system were
computed by using the physical parameters (masses; M1,2, radii; R1,2, Planck
functions; B1,2, fractional projected area depending on orbital phase; A1,2(φ),
orbital inclination; i) as done by S¸enavcı et al. (2018) for SV Cam.

In Figure 2, the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeled for 0.0P orbital
phase of AR Lac (i.e. the stellar conﬁguration in which the hotter component
of the system is totally eclipsed by cooler component) was compared with SED
modeled for HD 56168, reference star, of the same spectral type with the cooler
component of AR Lac. In this Figure 2, the SED of a Black Body radiation with
the temperature of the same temperature of the cooler component of AR Lac

(K0 IV, 5100 K) was also included. As shown in Figure 2, the ﬂux values of
SED obtained from photometric CCD data are well compatible with the spectral
model results. However, this compatibility appears to be seen in the B, V,
Rc bands for TFOSC spectral data, while there is a signiﬁcant decrease in the
continuum level of TFOSC spectrum due to Telluric line absorption eﬀect in
the Ic band spectral range (see Figure 3).

2.2. High Dispersion Spectra

In order to determine the activity level of a star depending on spectral
Hα proﬁle, the photospheric eﬀect must be removed from the Hα line pro-
ﬁle. In the case of binary system, the ﬂux contributions to photospheric Hα
absorption from both components were also taken into consideration in this
method of determination of the activity level. This method, which eliminates
the photospheric absorption eﬀect from Hα line proﬁle, is called ”Spectral
Extraction Method”. In this study, we tried to analyse the behaviour of Hα
excess emission in chromospherically active binary system AR Lac, by using
this Spectral Extraction Method. For this purpose, high resolution spectra of
AR Lac, at diﬀerent orbital phases, in the wavelength range of 6500 − 6700˚A
with resolution power R ∼ 40000 were taken on July 13-14, 2013 by using
Coude Echelle Spectrograph equipped with RTT150 telescope of TUG. The log
of high resolution spectral observations are given in Tables 2 and 3.

The chromospheric contribution to Hα line proﬁle has been determined
using the spectral subtraction technique. This technique was applied to high
resolution spectra of AR Lac binary system with the following steps:

i) The high resolution spectra of reference stars (HD 195405 and HR 6256)
taken at TUG were compared with the high resolution ELODIE spectra4

of HD 12235 (G2 V) and HD 23249 (K0 IV) stars (which were selected
from the catalogue of Montes et al. 1997). This comparison showed
that the Hα proﬁles of TUG and ELODIE spectra were compatible (see
Figure 4).

ii) From the catalogue of Montes et al. (1997), the rotational equatorial ve-
locities were obtained as ¡ 15 kms−1 and 2 kms−1 for HD 12235 (G2 IV)
and HD 23249 (K0 IV), respectively. Based on our compatible results,
in accordance with their spectral type, we attributed these velocities to
our reference stars (HD 195405 and HR 6256).

iii) Rotational velocities for the components of AR Lac binary system(G2
IV + K0 IV), were found by Frasca et al. (2001) as 46 kms−1 and 73
kms−1, respectively (see Table 4). Depending on the orbital phase, the
observed Hα line proﬁles of double-lined spectroscopic and active binary
system, AR Lac, are shown in the left panel of Figure 6. Taking into
account the rotational velocities of Frasca et al. (2001), given above,
the following rotational velocities were applied to the observed spectra
of reference stars in modelling the synthetic spectrum of AR Lac bi-
nary system by using STARMOD program (see Barden 1985; Montes et al.
2000):
V(rot) ∼ 30 kms−1 (= 46 − 15), for HD 195405 (G2 IV)
V(rot) ∼ 70 kms−1 (= 73 − 2), for HR 6256 (K0 IV)
The input parameters for the STARMOD program were derived by using
the parameters of the AR Lac as given in Table 4. The obtained syn-
thetic spectra are shown in Figures 5 and 6 for reference stars and AR
Lac, respectively.

Since most of the high resolution spectra were taken during minima times
within the scope of this study, Hα proﬁles of the components of AR Lac binary
system were too close to each other (see Figure 7). Therefore, the Hα proﬁles
of the components could not be separated from each other. In addition, the
number of spectral Hα proﬁles of the components that can be distinguished
is very few, so the equivalent width measurements for these Hα proﬁles were
not made.

2.3. Photometric CCD and Infrared Observations

In order to evaluate the spectral results, within the scope of extended
matter research, of this study together with the results of photometric CCD
and Infrared observations, we constructed the B, V, Rc, Ic, W1, W2, W3 and
W4 (WISE)5 (see Wright et al. 2010) band light curves and some characteris-
tics of AR Lac active binary system based on related observational data of
Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020). These BVRcIc observational data were obtained
during the period 2012-2013, while WISE data were obtained in 2010. Light

curves obtained in normalized luminosity for each band are shown in Figures 9
and 10. And, the results of colour excess (CE) measurements for diﬀerent pho-
tometric bands are also shown in Figure 11.

By taking the advantage of geometric conﬁguration of the components of
an active and total eclipsing binary system, the presence of an excess radia-
tion of active component can easily be detected during the primary minimum
at which the occultation of hotter component by cooler and active one (e.g.
Hall & Ramsey 1994; Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci 2020). This conﬁguration dur-
ing primary minimum of a total eclipsing and active binary system could also
give an advantage to search for the interaction between the activity/spots phe-
nomena and the extended/circumstellar matter which may exist in the system.
Therefore, it is important and useful to examine the structural changes of pho-
tospheric/chromospheric spectral line proﬁles and to reveal the structure in
spectral energy distribution (SED), during primary minimum. In this context,
active and eclipsing binaries are important in extended/circumstellar matter’s
studies.

As can be seen from Figures 9 and 10, in the light curves of AR Lac, the
depths of primary and secondary minima vary depending on colour (i.e the
photometric band). Using the correlation below for the ratio of the minima
depth of a light curve (see Kopal & Demircan 1978), in the case of sin i = 1,
we can estimate the ﬂux ratio of the component stars as:

FK0IV
FG2IV

=

Depth of Min. I
Depth of Min. II

,

(1)

Using all these light curves, the results of ﬂux ratios are given in Table 6.
As can be seen from these observational results, the observed ﬂux ratios
decrease gradually by about 10% towards the longer wavelength (W1), and in
the infrared wavelengths of WISE the ﬂux of components are approximately
equal except W3 and W4 bands (see Table 6). This decrease in ﬂux ratios
towards the longer wavelengths and the equality of ﬂuxes in W1 and W2 bands
suggest that possible extended/circumstellar matter may exist in the AR Lac
active binary system.

3. RESULTS

The ﬂux values of SED obtained from photometric CCD data are well com-
patible with the spectral model results of AR Lac binary system (see Figure 2).
From a comparative analysis of the data in Figure 2, it was found that during
primary minimum of AR Lac, there was an excess radiation of ≃ 0.143 ± 0.043
in the W2 band compared to the HD 56168 reference star. It is clear that this
excess radiation at primary minimum can be attributed to the cooler compo-
nent (K0 IV) of AR Lac binary system.

As can be seen from Table 1, the low resolution TFOSC spectra of AR Lac
were obtained on Oct. 12, 2015 and June 5, 2016 (at times corresponding
to minima times), and on Sept. 5, 2016 at times corresponding to outside

eclipses. The times which correspond to minima and outside eclipses are de-
termined within the scope of this study. The analysis results of our TFOSC
observations were found as given in Figure 3, along with the synthetic spec-
trum comparison. In addition, visual and infrared photometric results were
added to the evaluation of these low resolution spectral results in Figure 3.

From the patterns given in Figure 3, it is seen that the results of low
resolution spectra of AR Lac, taken in both minima and outside eclipse phases,
are compatible with the results of synthetic spectra. In addition, photometric
ﬂux measurements are also observed to be compatible except for the W2 band
(λ = 46028 ˚A, ∆λ = 10423 ˚A). The photometric ﬂux measurements in W2
band clearly show that there is an excess radiation in this band in the AR
Lac. Excess radiation rates in f(W2)/f(V) have been found as follows:
At 0.995P the excess radiation rate is about 0.227 ± 0.047,
At 0.496P the excess radiation rate is about 0.176 ± 0.031,
At 0.894P the excess radiation rate is about 0.136 ± 0.028.

Based on the model spectral solutions of high resolution Hα line proﬁles
(see Figure 6) of the system, the variation of Hα and their residual proﬁles
depending on orbital phases were obtained as given in Figure 7.

Using our synthetic model spectrum solutions, the radial velocities ob-
tained from residual Hα proﬁles of AR Lac are given in Table 5. These radial
velocity measurements were also compared with the radial velocity curve by
Frasca et al. (2000), as given in Figure 8. The discussion of these results is
given in the following Section 4.

From our analysis of the minimum depth ratios of the light curves of AR
Lac (see Table 6 and Figures 9 and 10), obtained in this study, it was seen
that the ﬂux values of the components of this active binary system were going
to be equal, towards the longer wavelengths. These results are also discussed

18

KARAKUS¸ & EKMEKC¸ I

in Section 4 in the context of existence of an extended/circumstellar matter
in the system.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Although recently, an observational evidence of the presence of extended

/circumstellar matter has not been found, except in W2 band, by Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci
(2020) in the AR Lac active binary system based on their IR excess measure-
ment results, this issue has been re-evaluated with the results of the spec-
tral analyses of this study. Our spectral analysis results of the low and
high resolution spectra of AR Lac were evaluated within the scope of ex-
tended/circumstellar matter researched together with our previous photomet-
ric results. A discussion on these results can be summarized as follows:

i) During the 0.0P orbital phase of the AR Lac binary system, the hotter
component (G2 IV) is totally eclipsed and therefore only the radiation
from the cooler component (K0 IV) of the system can be observed.
In Figure 2, the SED (Spectral Energy Distributon) measurement
results during 0.0P orbital phase of the AR Lac and the results of the
HD 56168 ((B − V )◦=0.90 ± 0.01; as a reference and inactive star) were
compared with SED of a black body radiation of an eﬀective temperature
of 5100 K. From this comparison, it was seen that the AR Lac has an
excess radiation in the W2 band. We were unable to compare our SED
measurement results with those of Busso et al. (1988) for AR Lac due to
their evaluations did not depend on orbital phase and the components
of AR Lac were taken into consideration as G5 V+G8 IV (see their Table
5b and Figure 4). However, roughly, our SED results for outside eclipse
phases (see the bottom pattern of Figure 3 of this study) appear to be
consistent with their results.

ii) In addition to our SED evaluations made at the primary minimum for
AR Lac binary system in Figure 2, our SED results, together with our
TFOSC spectral data, in the secondary minimum and outside eclipse
phases were obtained as given in Figure 3. From all patterns given
in Figure 3, it clearly appears that AR Lac has a signiﬁcant excess ra-
diation in the W2 band at all orbital phases. The relative value of this
excess radiation in the W2 band was at highest level at primary min-
imum and at the lowest level at around outside eclipse phases, with
an average value of ∼ 0.18 ± 0.03. This result is also compatible with
the results of photometric colour excess (CE) measurements obtained
by Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020) for the AR Lac (see Figure 11). There-
fore, these characteristics of excess radiation depending on orbital phase
show that the source of excess radiation in the AR Lac is mainly due
to the cooler component (K0 IV) of the system. Using the Spitzer
Space Telescope data, obtained during the observing period Novem-
ber 2005-January 2007, Matranga et al. (2010) reported that there was

NEW SPECTRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS OF AR LAC

no signiﬁcant warm dust in the AR Lac binary system, but it was found
they gave photometric IR measurements that were partially compatible
with our ﬁndings. Unfortunately, our survey of data sources found no
information about which element or molecule is emitting/absorbing a
radiation in the region 4.6 microns, and related atomic terms.

iii) Within the scope of this study, the high resolution Hα proﬁle obser-
vations of AR Lac were made especially at/near minima times. The
Spectral Extraction Method was used in modelling spectral Hα proﬁles.
The residual Hα proﬁles of AR Lac binary system have been obtained
in the form of emission and absorption proﬁles which are compatible
with radial velocities of the components of the system (see Figures 6
and 7). These residual Hα proﬁles are clearly seen as emissions for both
components, especially at 0.013P, 0.028P, 0.514P, 0.546P, 0.565P, and
0.581P orbital phases. However, the central depths of Hα absorption
proﬁles of AR Lac at 0.048P, 0.065P, 0.081P, and 0.098P orbital phases
were less deeper than of the depths of synthetic proﬁles (see Figure 6).
The absorption feature in the residual Hα proﬁles of AR Lac could
be seen at these orbital phases. This excess absorption structure in
the residual Hα proﬁles of AR Lac observed at/near primary minimum
phases is compatible with the ﬁnding results of Zboril et al. (2004) and
Frasca et al. (2000). These residual Hα proﬁles (see Figure 7) provide
information about the level and the variation of stellar activity in the
AR Lac binary system. In addition, the residual Hα proﬁles of the cooler
component of AR Lac binary system appear to be wider and intensive
than the proﬁles of the hotter component. That is, from these residual
Hα proﬁles, given in Figure 7, we see that the stellar activity in AR
Lac binary system comes mainly from the secondary/cooler component
and this cooler component rotates faster than primary/hotter compo-
nent. These are the characteristics related to the expected results of
chromospheric active stars.

iv) Using synthetic spectra constructed for high resolution Coude Echelle
spectra of AR Lac binary system, the radial velocity measurements
of the component stars were made from the residual Hα proﬁles. All
these radial velocity measurement results are shown in Figure 8 together
with the radial velocity curves drawn based on the radial velocity mea-
surement results obtained by Frasca et al. (2000) for the AR Lac bi-
nary system. As can be seen from Figure 8, the diﬀerences between
these radial velocities (RVs) and the photospheric RVs give us obser-
vational evidence about the RVs which correspond to active regions
in the chromosphere, which are at higher layers of the stellar atmo-
sphere. Frasca et al. (2000), based on their study on Hα spectroscopy
of AR Lac, had reported an extra absorption during primary eclipse (at
0.99P) which extends in blue side producing an asymmetric emission of
the cool star with a center position shifted to red by 68 kms−1 (i.e. equal
to the v sin i of the K0 IV component). A similar result of this extra
absorption was determined by using the residual Hα absorption struc-
ture with the RVs of about -47.5 kms−1 and -59.8 kms−1, at 0.081P
and 0.098P, respectively (see Table 5 and green squares in Figure 8).
It seems that this extra absorption is most likely due to the promi-
nence on the K0 IV component of AR Lac binary system. In summary,

NEW SPECTRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS OF AR LAC

21

based on this observational evidence, it appears that a prominence-like
extended/circumstellar matter most likely exist around the cooler com-
ponent of AR Lac active binary system. Therefore, it can be suggested
that such a low-density extended/circumstellar matter causes a colour
excess or a residual emission/absorption in the AR Lac binary system.

v) Our evaluations on the ﬂux ratios of the component stars of AR Lac
from the minima depth ratios of the light curves of the system (see Ta-
ble 6 and Figures 9 and 10), show that the ﬂuxes of the component
stars are to be equal or almost equal to each other in W1, W2, and W3
band light curves. As can be seen from Table 6, the ﬂux ratio or the
component of AR Lac in W2 band is smaller than 1. This is because the
depth of primary minimum(Min.
I) of the light curve is less than of
secondary minimum (Min. II), that is, when the hotter component(G2
IV) is behind the cooler component(K0 IV). In other words,in W2 band
the system is brighter during primary minimum than in its secondary
minimum phases. On the other hand, it was found that W2 band is addi-
tionally sensitive to hot dust(see Cluver et al. 2014). Therefore, the fact
that the W2 ﬂux ratio for the components of AR Lac binary system is
smaller than 1, suggests that the extended/circumstellar matter around
K0 IV component could likely be heated by the hotter component dur-
ing the orbital phase 0.0P. In addition, the equality in ﬂuxes, for the
remaining bands, could be the result of an extended/circumstellar mat-
ter/material that can be detected in the wavelengths of these bands in
the AR Lac. The colour excess(CE) measurement results in these bands
by Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci (2020) also support this suggestion: CE values
in these bands were obtained as CE(V − W1) ≃ CE(V − W3) ≃ 0.1 and
CE(V − W2) ≃ 0.4 (see Figure 11).

The results of radio and polarization observations of AR Lac binary sys-
tem, published in the period 1977-2007 (see Owen & Spangler 1977; Brown et al.
1979; Walter et al. 1983; Doiron & Mutel 1984; Walter et al. 1987; Trigilio et al.
2001; Koch 2007), are in agreement with the results of this study. Based on
all these spectroscopic and photometric ﬁndings obtained in this study, it can
be concluded that in the AR Lac, there are not only evidences/contributions
of excess radiation caused by stellar activity, but also caused by the presence
of an extended/circumstellar matter. In other words, the results obtained in
this study, together with the radio and polarization observation results of AR
Lac binary system, were evaluated as follows: We made an investigation to
ﬁnd an evidence as to whether the eﬀect of the extended/circumstellar mat-
ter(thought to exists) or the extended corona of the K0 IV component of the
system contributes more to emergence of these observational ﬁndings.

It can be clearly seen that these results are in agreement with the conclu-
sion of this study that an extended/circumstellar matter could, most likely,
exist in the AR Lac active binary system.

However, it should also be noted that although the mass-loss rate obtained

during minima and outside eclipses (0.0P are indicated as red colour, 0.5P as
blue, and the outside phases as green points). CE values are in magnitudes (from
Karaku¸s & Ekmek¸ci 2020).

by using the long-term secular period decreasing due to stellar magnetic ac-
tivity of AR Lac binary system is very small (see Lu et al. 2012), we see that
the stellar activity of this binary system is suﬃcient to aﬀect the coronal
structure (see Walter et al. 1983) and the minima depth ratios of the light
curves (see Table 6, Figures 9 and 10; which suggest the presence of common
envelope such as β Lyr or W UMa type binary systems) and the residual
Hα emissions (see Figure 7) gave some important observational evidences for
extended/circumstellar matter. Therefore, it is useful to have some more
sensitive observational studies and continue these researches.
