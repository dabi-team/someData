ABSTRACT

In this paper we introduce novel Virtual Reality (VR) and Aug-
mented Reality (AR) treatments to improve the psychological well
being of patients in palliative care, based on interviews with a clin-
ical psychologist who has successfully implemented VR assisted
interventions on palliative care patients in the Hong Kong hospital
system. Our VR and AR assisted interventions are adaptations of
traditional palliative care therapies which simultaneously facilitate
patients communication with family and friends while isolated in
hospital due to physical weakness and COVID-19 related restrictions.
The ﬁrst system we propose is a networked, metaverse platform for
palliative care patients to create customized virtual environments
with therapists, family and friends which function as immersive and
collaborative versions of ‘life review’ and ‘reminiscence therapy’.
The second proposed system will investigate the use of Mixed Real-
ity telepresence and haptic touch in an AR environment, which will
allow palliative care patients to physically feel friends and family
in a virtual space, adding to the sense of presence and immersion in
that environment.

centered computing—Virtual reality

1 INTRODUCTION

In the current Hong Kong hospital system palliative care patients are
often socially isolated from family and friends in their ﬁnal weeks
and months of life as a result of weakness and physical deterioration,
a situation which has been exacerbated by strict COVID-19 social
distancing measures. These circumstances often leave patients in
states of psychological, emotional and spiritual distress before death,
which also increases their experience of physical pain. According
to a recent systematic review on the unmet supportive care needs of
advanced cancer patients and their caregivers [36], the most com-
monly reported domain was lack of psychological support, with the
absence of family and friends (9.9–96.5%) and emotional assistance
(10.1–84.4%) accounting for the largest share of unmet needs, with
an additional frequently collected response being patients inability
to communicate with the outside world (7.7–87.9%). Since unmet
needs have a detrimental effect on well-being [18, 27], an innova-
tive intervention that is able to address all of these psychological
problems while overcoming the constraints of physical isolation is
of pressing demand. Palliative care plays an essential role in these
circumstances, providing holistic care which aims to manage phys-
ical symptoms while addressing the psychological and emotional
needs of the patient using various therapeutic methods to help them
‘prepare for death and afﬁrm the patient as a human with a unique

life.’ [20]. One novel and effective technique used by clinical psy-
chologists is ‘life review’ and ’reminiscence’ therapy [2, 37, 38],
which involves the systematic examination of various life experi-
ences with the aim of resolving conﬂict and completion of life tasks
in order to help the patient come to terms with death. Examples of
the therapeutic outcomes of ’life review’ and ’reminiscence’ therapy
are the writing of texts in collaboration with a therapist and the
production of picture books, audio recordings or cookbooks as a
’legacy’ gift for family members after the patients death. A con-
straint of this therapy is that it consists entirely of spoken, textual or
2D visual communication and generally does not directly involve
friends and family members who were participants in the patient’s
life experiences.

In this respect, we propose that metaverse and VR/AR technolo-
gies offer novel and unprecedented opportunities for the fulﬁllment
of palliative care patients unmet psychological and physical needs.
We suggest that these platforms and systems can improve the psy-
chological efﬁcacy of ’life review’ and ’reminiscence’ therapy tech-
niques at the same time as facilitating remote communication with
family and friends with a greater sense of presence and immersion.
This research project involves the development of a VR and an
AR system designed to assist with the psychological interventions
currently being implemented on palliative care patients in the Hong
Kong hospital system. The ﬁrst system is a virtual reality, metaverse
platform for palliative care patients to communicate with friends and
family using custom 3D generated environments based on emotion-
ally signiﬁcant spaces for the patient that also incorporate photos
and videos from their social media accounts. These virtual social
spaces will have a positive therapeutic function as embodied and net-
worked versions of ‘life review’ and ‘reminiscence’ therapy which
also allow patients to communicate and collaborate with family and
friends in creating positive spaces for memory and reﬂection on
their lives. The second proposed system will involve the integration
of haptic touch into VR and AR telepresence systems which will
allow patients to not only personally communicate, but physically
interact with family and friends through the use of AR holograms
and haptic sensors, in which patients can meet virtual visitors in
any environment or even teleport to their former home. We propose
that an AR telepresence application can use haptic technologies to
facilitate co-presence and enable affective communication by being
able to convey a wealth of socio-emotional information and elicit
many positive emotions similar to those of natural touch [15]. This
research project explores the unique potential for VR and AR tech-
nologies to provide palliative care patients with platforms for social
interaction with the outside world which will ultimately beneﬁt their
psychological wellbeing. It will also examine dimensions for social
interaction that traverse not only space through remote communi-
cation, but also time, by creating customized virtual environments
that will serve as posthumous archives of patients’ experiences and
memories in the metaverse before and even after death.

Based on the related work and an interview with a pallitiave care
expert [3] we want to address the following three research questions
in our future work: RQ 1: Can interactive virtual platforms for
palliative care patients assist traditional life review/reminiscence

 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy techniques used by clinical psychologists to improve quality
of life (QOL)? RQ 2: Is there increased co-presence in a networked
3D environment presented in virtual reality for immersive com-
munication between palliative care patients and family members
compared with remote communication using 2D interfaces such as
phones and laptops? RQ 3: Can haptic interaction in a networked
3D virtual environment improve the social presence and affective
communication between palliative care patients with family and
friends?

To address these research questions, we are proposing and outlin-
ing the development of Virtual Reality system speciﬁcally designed
for palliative care patients. Additionally, we interviewed a clini-
cal psychologist who is already using Virtual Reality therapies for
palliative care.

2 RELATED WORK

A recent review conducted by Blomstrom et al. [5] of innovative
interventions used by clinical psychologists in palliative care ther-
apy included virtual reality alongside psychotherapeutic techniques,
mindfulness and psychedelics as promising new areas for research.
A number of these studies have examined the use of virtual reality
to overcome fear of death and dying, using near-death-experiences
(NDE) which harness the full body illusions possible in VR and
AR to induce out-of-body experiences which have demonstrated
decreased fear-of-death outcomes for participants [6, 8].

There is a small but growing body of research on the the use
and effectiveness of virtual reality in palliative care, with a system-
atic meta-analysis conducted by Mo et al. [24] having examined
all eight studies produced so far concluding that while the tech-
nique is feasible and acceptable, the quality of the extant studies
was graded as very low. Several of the papers analyzed involve
patients experiencing guided walks in nature based virtual reality
environments [16], [4], [14], two feature personalized experiences
and virtual travel [28], [31] and another two include music therapy
and viewing of still images [9], [19]. From the review, two out of
the eight studies reported lower pain scores amongst patients after a
guided VR experience [16], [31] while in six of the studies patients
reported positive attitudes to using virtual reality [16], [4], [9], [13]
and four reported difﬁculties in operating the software and hard-
ware [4], [9], [14], [19].

The interchangeably used ’life review’ and ’reminiscence’ therapy
techniques have been increasingly utilized by clinical psychologists
and studies have revealed its signiﬁcant positive impact on the quality
of life of palliative care patients. In the systematic review conducted
by Keall et al. [21] they described the diverse variety of life review
therapies used by psychologist which variously include; One week
short term life review that features the creation of a picture book
of life events, good and bad memories accompanied with text [2].
Dignity therapy involving the writing of a book about the patients life
which becomes a legacy gift to family [11], [12]. Legacy Activities
in which patients work with a carer to produce legacy activities to
be enjoyed by family members after death, e.g., audiotape of family
stories, scrapbook, cookbook [1].

A signiﬁcant study for our research included in the systematic
review was the The Meaning of Life Intervention conducted by Mok
et al. [25] which involved semi-structured recorded interviews with
patients asking the questions ’What do you think about your life?’,
’How have you faced adversity in your life?’ and ’What do you
do to love yourself and others? What brings you joy? What do
you appreciate in your life?’ The process of conducting these inter-
views and asking basic questions about life and mortality produced
demonstrable improvements in quality of life for patients. The only
study so far to incorporate virtual reality into life review therapy was
conducted by Dang et al. [13] which developed a virtual avatar to
lead a life review therapy session with palliative care patients, which
bears similarity to research conducted by Tominari et al. [35] which

developed a virtual reminiscence therapy for dementia sufferers us-
ing 360 videos presented on touchscreen pads. In contrast to these
examples, our research instead focuses on the creation of a platform
for collaborative exchange between the patient, family and friends
and the therapist to generate a virtual space of collective memory
analogous to the legacy outcomes which result from traditional life
review and reminiscence therapy interventions. VR/AR telepresence
applications can also make an important contribution to palliative
care by using haptic technologies to facilitate co-presence and enable
affective communication by providing the opportunity for patients to
touch their loved ones. Even relatively simple tactile actuators can
be used to convey a wealth of socio-emotional information and elicit
many positive emotions similar to those of natural touch [15]. For
example, virtual touch has been shown to reduce anxiety triggered
by watching a sad video [10] and increase shared conversation while
watching a comedy clip with other users [22]. In addition to affective
modulation, receiving virbrotactile signals from other users has been
shown to promote co-presence and interpersonal connectedness [26]
and elicit helpful behavior and generosity in social decision-making
paradigms [17].

3 INTERVIEW WITH A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST USING VIR-
TUAL REALITY IN PALLIATIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS
Currently, there are no quantitative and qualitative data on the feasi-
bility of using virtual reality in palliative care in Hong Kong. There-
fore, we conducted a semi-structured interview with Ms. Olive Woo,
one of the ﬁrst clinical psychologists currently using virtual reality
in her therapeutic interventions with palliative care patients in the
Hong Kong public hospital system. Our questions were organized
into three themes:

1. Motivations for using virtual reality with palliative care pa-

tients.

2. Feasibility for the use of virtual reality with palliative care

patients.

3. The results of using virtual reality based palliative care inter-

ventions.

Motivations for using virtual reality with palliative patients
The wish of many terminally ill patients is to meet and say goodbye
to their family and friends. However, during the COVID-19 pan-
demic and due to geographical restrictions, this is often not possible.
For example, palliative care patients in Hong Kong currently only
allows limited visitations, and Hong Kong still has strict border re-
strictions. Virtual and augmented reality can allow patients to meet
family and friends in any virtual environment or even teleport into
their own homes. Ms. Woo stated her motivations for using the
technology:

There has been unmet needs among palliative care pa-
tients, despite the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and
psychological interventions. For example, some patients
wish to come back home during their last days of life,
but they are not allowed to given their physical condi-
tion, some patients wish to travel to new places, but it is
impossible.

In addition, the use of VR by Ms. Woo also responded to patients
stated desires for experiences beyond their physical conﬁnement as
well as spiritually motivated desires related to their own mortality,
which customized VR and AR experiences could possibly provide
access to. As Ms. Woo suggests;

Due to their speciﬁc needs, some contents are [not] yet
available. For example, they would like to see some
images related to heaven for relaxation.

Feasibility of using virtual reality with palliative care patients
The use of VR and AR proves advantageous in palliative care. A
feasibility study by Appel and colleagues [3] demonstrated that
older adults with reduced sensory, mobility, and/or impaired cog-
nition could beneﬁt from VR experiences. In the multi-site non-
randomized interventional study, all sixty-six participants with mild
to severe cognitive and/or physical impairments were able to com-
plete 3 to 20 minutes of 360°VR experience. Furthermore, the results
concluded that older adults had tolerated the VR experience well,
with most participants exhibiting positive emotions and reﬂecting
positive feedback, verifying VR as a practical medium to deliver an
embodied experience for communication.

However, while VR and AR offer enormous potential for remote
communication with greater feelings of presence and immersion,
there are some side effects and dangers of the technologies which
need to be considered and avoided, especially for use with the par-
ticularly vulnerable populations of palliative care patients. Common
side-effects of VR and AR include cybersickness (nausea, dizzi-
ness, headache, sweating, eye strain) [23] while users, especially
elderly ones, often have difﬁculty navigating the hardware and soft-
ware [4], [9], [14], [19]. Ms. Woo used different methodological
strategies to mitigate possible negative side effects which included
extensive screening of patients so that unsuitable ones were excluded
from the interventions to avoid unnecessary harm.

Some of them wish to use VR but their physical condi-
tion does not allow. For example, tetraplegic patients
or patients with cord compression may not be able to
sit but lay on bed, which renders the use of VR difﬁcult
(as they can only view the upper visual ﬁeld). Some of
them cannot move their head, which limits the use of VR.
Some of them may have motion sickness.

The results of using virtual reality based palliative care inter-
ventions
As the literature review above demonstrates, the use of virtual re-
ality in palliative care is acceptable and feasible, with some data
showing its effectiveness in reducing pain while two early studies
have provided evidence that VR can assist with traditional palliative
care therapies such as life review and reminiscence therapy. Ms.
Woo reported positive results for her VR interventions, and based on
informally administered outcome measures, patients have shown;

Positive change in mood and physical symptoms includ-
ing fatigue, pain, drowsiness, appetite.

While Ms. Woo also expressed her positive opinion for the efﬁcacy
of virtual reality as a palliative care therapy as it provides;

An easily-accessible alternative to meet their unmet
needs which have yet to be addressed by traditional treat-
ment approaches.

4 FUTURE WORK
Based on the related work and the interview with the clinical psy-
chologist, we propose a research methodology to answer our three
research questions:

Construction of Replica Hospital Room
In the experiments conducted using VR to induce out-of-body expe-
riences for participants to overcome fear-of-death done by Bourdin
et al. [6], [7], their studies participants were healthy rather than
dying patients. Following this model, we will conduct a pilot study
using the systems we develop on healthy participants to rigorously
test that they are safe to use before proceeding with a ﬁeld study with
palliative care patients. We will build a full-size replica of a normal
hospital room for palliative patients at the City University of Hong

Kong. This room will be equipped with a patient bed and a chair and
couch for visitors. Since some palliative patients are often bedridden
and too weak to sit, a replica room with a patient bed is crucial
to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and user experience of our
proposed systems before embarking on ﬁeld studies. Therefore, we
will conduct two of our pilot studies in this room on students and
healthy elderly people.

Hardware and Software Development

We will develop two software and one hardware project to answer
our three proposed research questions.

A crucial aspect for both systems is accessibility for bedridden,
weak patients. For this, we will additionally develop interaction
methods using eye-gaze and common VR controllers. Since some
patients are too weak to even move their head and therefore unable
to change their view in the virtual environment, we will develop
methods to change the view without triggering motion sickness.
These interaction methods will ﬁrst be tested on healthy students as
part of our pilot study.

For RQ 1, we will develop a VR Unity application for the Meta
Quest 2 that will have two modes: An authoring mode that allows
psychologists, caregivers, and family members to place images and
videos of a palliative care patient’s life in an immersive virtual en-
vironment. They will be able to choose from a variety of virtual
environments, the ﬁrst offers a selection of locations based on so-
cially and culturally signiﬁcant sites for the patient in Hong Kong
which will provide familiar and nostalgic spaces for the patient to
feel comfortable in. The second is a menu interface which allows
the patient to customize their own space, using a modular selection
of architecture, decor and furniture. The third provides a selection
of neutral relaxation spaces based on nature sites in Hong Kong.

In the therapy mode, the application allows the interaction with
the palliative care patient to walk through the environment and see
images from the patient’s life.
In these spaces, the patient can
communicate and collaborate in real-time using avatars with their
therapist, family and friends to create legacy rooms ﬁlled with photos
and videos from the patients and families social media that function
as virtual and embodied versions of life review and reminiscence
therapy.

For RQ2 and RQ3 we will develop two Augmented Reality telep-
resence systems: The ﬁrst system will be built for the Meta Quest 2
that allow patients and visitors to see and talk to each other via a live
stream (video, audio) from 360° cameras (Ricoh Theta Z1, Ricoh
Company, Ltd., Japan). Each camera transmits the live feed via a
connected computer to an RTMP server in the City University of
Hong Kong. The headsets receive the RTMP stream from the other
end.

The second approach is based on holoportation [29]. We will
build a holoportation system in Unity for a Video See-Through
Head-Mounted Display such as the Varjo XR-3 (Varjo Technologies
Oy, Helsinki, Finland) or the Lynx R1 (Lynx Mixed Reality, Paris,
France). We will use Azure Kinects (Microsoft Corporation, United
States) as depth cameras, that allow high-quality body segmentation,
which allows each end to see, hear as well as touch the other end.

To implement haptic sensations when patients touch the hologram,
we will develop a haptic glove that we will equip with multiple linear
resonance actuators (LRA) that will generate haptic sensations on
each ﬁnger and on the palm. The LRAs of the haptic glove will be
controlled by an ESP32 micro controller that can communicate to
the Meta Quest 2 over Bluetooth.

Pilot Study on Healthy Participants

The pilot study consists of two parts. In the ﬁrst part, we will recruit
10 healthy participants from the student population to test the relia-
bility and user experience of our systems as well to collect feedback

ence and affective communication between palliative care patients
with family and friends will be measured using an adaption of the
questionnaire using a bipolar seven-point Likert scale from Salln¨as’
thesis [32]. The questionnaire is to be translated into Cantonese.
Similar to the above questionnaires, the translated questionnaire
will ﬁrst be standardized using students before its adoption for the
palliative care participants and their family members.

5 CONCLUSION

Palliative patients suffer from a number of unmet needs, such as
the inability to communicate with the outside world, the inability
to remain at home during the last days of life, and the inability
to travel with loved ones. Based on an interview with a clinical
psychologist in Hong Kong who uses VR in palliative care and a
literature review of the current state of virtual reality therapies for
palliative care we propose that VR and AR offer easily-accessible
alternative therapies to meet the needs of patients which have yet
to be addressed by traditional treatment approaches. We propose
three systems to improve the interventions currently in use alongside
detailed methodologies for conducting a pilot and ﬁeld study using
these systems on healthy and palliative care patients in Hong Kong.

on our software and hardware platform. Participants will be compen-
sated with 200 Hong Kong dollars. After making adjustments to our
platform, we will recruit 10 healthy older participants through social
media ads as well as university channels to collect preliminary data
for our research questions.

Field Study - Palliative Care

Following the pilot study and the approval of an ethical application,
medical experts from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority will collect
data on patients in palliative care using our systems. Based on
our pilot study, we will conduct a power analysis to determine the
minimum sample size to ﬁnd signiﬁcant treatment effects.

Instruments

The outcomes of RQ1 which examines whether co-presence in a
networked, virtual version of life review/reminiscence therapy can
improve quality of life will be measured using the Quality-of-Life
Concerns in the End-of-Life (QOLC-E) questionnaire which was
adapted by Pang et al. [30] to record the QOL of Chinese patients
with advanced-stage cancer.

The outcomes of RQ2 which investigate whether co-presence in a
networked 3D environment presented in virtual reality for immersive
communication between palliative care patients and family members
compared with remote communication using 2D interfaces will
be measured using a Cantonese adaptation and translation of the
Presence Questionnaire (PD) developed by Slater et al. [34], [33]
to ﬁrst measure the sense of personal presence experienced by the
participants during the VR experience. A creation of Presence
in Virtual Reality Environments (CVEs) questionnaire will then
be developed in Cantonese to measure the co-presence felt by the
participants during the experiment. Upon translating and creating
the questionnaires, a pilot study using students will be conducted to
measure its validity and reliability before its adoption for palliative
care patients and their family members.

Lastly, the outcomes of RQ3 to inspect whether haptic interaction
in a networked 3D virtual environment improves the social pres-
