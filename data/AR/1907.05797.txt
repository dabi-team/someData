RESUMEN

Estudiamos los gradientes de metalicidad de O, Ne y Ar, derivados de neb-
ulosas planetarias (PNe), en comparaci´on con los de regiones H ii en las galaxias
M 31, M 33, NGC 300 y la V´ıa L´actea. Radios galactoc´entricos y abundancias fueron
recopilados de la literatura, seleccionando con cuidado una muestra homog´enea de
objetos en cada galaxia. Los gradientes de las PNe son m´as planos que los de las
regiones H ii en todos los casos. El caso m´as extremo es el de M 31, donde las
abundancias de las PNe no est´an relacionadas con la distancia galactoc´entrica y los
gradientes son consistentes con cero. Calculamos gradientes para PNe del Tipo I
y no-Tipo I de Peimbert, encontrando que los gradientes del Tipo I son m´as emp-
inados y m´as similares a los de las regiones H ii, lo que indicar´ıa que los gradientes
de metalicidad se empinan con el tiempo. Alternativamente los gradientes planos
de las viejas PNe indican que la migraci´on radial juega un importante papel en las
galaxias.

ABSTRACT

Metallicity gradients derived from planetary nebulae (PNe) using O, Ne, and
Ar abundances are studied and compared to those from H ii regions in the galax-
ies M 31, M 33, NGC 300 and the Milky Way. Galactocentric radii and chemical
abundances were collected from the literature, carefully selecting a homogeneous
sample for each galaxy. Metallicity gradients shown by PNe are ﬂatter than those
of H ii regions in all cases. The extreme case is M 31 where PN abundances are
not related to galactocentric distances and the gradients are consistent with zero.
To analyze the evolution of gradients with time we build gradients for Peimbert
Type I and non-Type I PNe ﬁnding that Type I PNe show steeper gradients than
non-Type I PNe and more similar to the ones of H ii regions indicating that the
chemical gradients might steepen with time. Alternatively, the ﬂat gradients for
old PNe show that radial migration could have an important role in the evolution
of galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Metallicity gradients in disk galaxies, provided by the analysis of the chemistry of H ii regions at diﬀerent
galactocentric distances, have been studied since long ago (Aller 1942; Searle 1971, and many others), as such
an analysis gives information on the chemical history of the host galaxy. The history of star formation and
the processes of accretion and mass loss in a galaxy can be determined by using chemical evolution models
that reproduce the present chemical abundances of the interstellar medium (ISM) using the abundances of H ii
regions as constraint. See e.g., Carigi & Peimbert (2011).

It has been found that metallicity gradients obtained from H ii regions and other indicators are always
negative, that is, chemical abundances are lower at larger galactocentric distances. Many galaxies have been

analyzed showing the same result. Recently S´anchez et al. (2014) analyzed the O abundance in a large number
of H ii regions in more than 300 galaxies observed by the CALIFA survey, reporting that in many galaxies with
H ii regions detected beyond two disk eﬀective radii, the slope presents a ﬂattening at large distances and in
some cases a drop or truncation of the O abundance occurs in the inner regions.

Since some time ago the abundances determined for PNe are being also used to analyze the chemical gradi-
ents in galaxies. Among the oldest studies of PNe in the Milky Way we ﬁnd that by D’Odorico, Peimbert, & Sabbadin
(1976) and Kaler (1980). As PNe are objects with ages between 1 and 10 Gyr, they provide information of the
past ISM abundances, helping then in the determination of the evolution of the chemical abundances in a galaxy,
and providing additional constraints for the chemical evolution models of a galaxy (Hern´andez-Mart´ınez et al.
2011).

Oxygen is the most used element to determine the chemistry of H ii regions because its abundance in these
photoionized nebulae is well determined by just adding the ionic abundances of O+ and O++, whose lines are
observed in the visual range of wavelengths. The determination of ionic abundances requires the determination
of physical conditions in the plasma, in particular the electron temperature which can be derived also in the
visual range by detecting the faint auroral lines [Oiii] λ4363 and [Nii] λ5755, in order to use the so called
direct-method to determine abundances.

Gradients based on oxygen abundances have been also calculated from PN data although for the case of
highly ionized objects a correction due to the presence of O+3 is required. However, it has been shown that O in
PNe may be enriched (or depleted) due to stellar nucleosynthesis, particularly in low-metallicity environments
(Pe˜na, Stasi´nska, & Richer 2007; Flores-Dur´an, Pe˜na, & Ruiz 2017) and also in Galactic PNe with carbon-rich
dust (Delgado-Inglada et al. 2015). Therefore metallicity gradients derived from O abundances in PNe could be
perturbed by stellar nucleosynthesis and thus this element could be not adequate to analyze the chemical gradi-
ents and the evolution of galaxies. Apparently Ne abundances are also modiﬁed by stellar nucleosynthesis in low-
metallicity environments (Karakas 2010; Milingo et al. 2010; Flores-Dur´an, Pe˜na, & Ruiz 2017). On the other
hand, Ar and S abundances in PNe are not expected to be modiﬁed in such processes during the PN progenitor
lifetime, although their abundance determinations have large uncertainties due to large uncertainties in the ion-
ization correction factors when only one ion (Ar++ or S+) is observed (Delgado-Inglada, Morisset, & Stasi´nska
2014). Especially S abundance presents several problems, like ’the Sulphur anomaly’. See e.g., Henry et al.
(2010).

Considering the above, in this work we propose to use Ar/H, together with O/H and Ne/H abundance
ratios, to trace the PN metallicity gradients in the galaxies of the local universe M 31, M 33, NGC 300, and
the Milky Way (MW). Gradients of PNe will be discussed in comparison with those of H ii regions. In §2 we
present the data used for the diﬀerent galaxies. In §3 the abundance gradients are calculated for each galaxy.
In §4 our results are presented and discussed, and our conclusions are indicated in §5.

2. DATA ACQUISITION

Data used in this work consist of abundances and galactocentric distances of PNe and H ii regions of
the spiral galaxies M 31, M 33, NGC 300, and the Milky Way. Most data were obtained from the literature
trying to include only abundances calculated with the direct-method (electron temperature determined), in
a homogeneous way by one group of authors. However in some cases data from diﬀerent sources have been
included in order to obtain a larger sample of objects for statistical studies, covering as much galactic radius as
possible. This introduced some degree of inhomogeneity that has been minimized by adopting only objects with
electron temperature determined and by using recent ionization correction factors. We have selected samples
where O, Ne, and Ar abundances are available.

We intend to build gradients based only on data from genuine PNe and H ii regions, therefore for all the
galaxies, we carefully selected as genuine PNe those objects where [Oiii] λ5007 intensity, relative to Hβ is
larger than 3, because a lower value could correspond to a compact H ii region and not to a bona-ﬁde PN. This
criterium has been used for instance by Ciardullo et al. (2002) to select PNe to build the PNLF in external
galaxies. On the other hand, H ii regions showing [Oiii] λ5007intensity larger than 3 times Hβ were eliminated
from the sample because these objects could correspond to nebulae around WR stars or SN remnants, whose
abundances can be contaminated by the processes in the central stars and would not correspond to abundances
of authentic pre-star nebulae.

In Table 1 we present several characteristics of the studied galaxies such as their Hubble type, mass, distance

to the Milky Way and the optical radius R25 (the 25 mag arcsec−2 isophotal radius).

The well known M 31 is the most massive spiral galaxy in the Local Group. It is at a distance of 785 kpc

2.1. M 31

from the Milky Way (McConnachie et al. 2005).

Chemical gradients calculated from the abundances of H ii regions have been studied by several authors,
most of the times based on abundances derived by using strong-line methods because due to the high metallicity
in this galaxy, the auroral lines indicative of electron temperature, such as [Oiii]λ4363 and [Nii]λ5755, are faint
and diﬃcult to detect. The biggest sample analyzed in this way is the one by Sanders et al. (2012), which
included 192 H ii regions. They reported an O abundance gradient of about −0.0195 ± 0.0055 dex kpc−1, but
found that the slope depends on the choice of the strong-line method used.

Zurita & Bresolin (2012) obtained abundances based on the direct-method for 31 H ii regions concentrated
at two galactocentric distances of 3.9 and 16.1 kpc. These authors discussed the O/H abundance gradient
ﬁnding a robust negative slope of ∆O/H / ∆R = −0.023 dex kpc−1 based on both, the direct-method and the
strong-line method. This value is similar to the values reported by other authors, based on strong-line methods
(Zaritsky, Kennicutt, & Huchra 1994; Sanders et al. 2012).

Interestingly, Zurita & Bresolin (2012) found that O abundances, determined with the direct-method in
their H ii regions, are lower, by about 0.3 dex, than the values determined with the strong-line methods and
the values derived for supergiant stars, at any galactocentric distance. The authors attribute this discrepancy
to a bias in their sample which would be not representative of the mean H ii region population (because
only high-temperature regions, and thus of low metallicity, could be detected in their search), and to the
probable depletion of O in dust grains. Abundance data for H ii regions, used in this work, are taken from
Zurita & Bresolin (2012).

Data for PNe were collected from the articles by Kwitter et al. (2012); Sanders et al. (2012); Balick et al.
(2013); and Fang et al. (2013, 2015). The use of data from diﬀerent authors can introduce undesirable in-
homogeneities, therefore, in order to analyze chemical abundances on a more homogeneous system, physical
conditions and ionic abundances of PNe were recalculated by us from the extinction-corrected line intensities
published by the cited authors. The IRAF 2.16 ﬁve level nebular modelling package ”stsdas.analysis.nebular”,
with the tasks temden and ionic, were employed to determine physical conditions and ionic abundances. For
all the sample the [O III] temperature was derived and occasionally the [N II] temperature was available, but
all the ionic abundances were calculated with the [O III] temperature (one-temperature zone model). To-
tal abundances were derived from the ionic abundances by using the ionization correction factors (ICFs) by
Delgado-Inglada, Morisset, & Stasi´nska (2014) to correct for the not seen ions. The results, although not too
diﬀerent from the ones published by the cited authors, are now in a homogeneous system.

The PN distribution in this galaxy extends up to R/R25 ∼ 5 (R ≥ 100 kpc) while data for the H ii regions

cover only up to R/R25 ∼ 1 (R ∼ 20 kpc).

The galactocentric distances used in the diagrams for the gradients were collected from the same references

used for the abundance ratios.

2.2. M 33

M 33 is the third spiral galaxy in the Local Group. Its Hubble type is very late, SA(s)cd, and its mass is
much lower than the masses of the Milky Way and M 31, by factors of 16 and 30 respectively. It is located
at 849 kpc from the Milky Way and appears almost face-on. The central metallicity in M 33 as given by H ii
regions, 12+log O/H= 8.5, is lower than in the bigger spirals, and it is even lower than in NGC 300 (see Table
2).

Gradients from PN abundances are found in Magrini, Stanghellini, & Villaver (2009) and Bresolin et al.

(2010) who found that the slopes are equal to the ones of H ii regions or ﬂatter, respectively.

For this galaxy, PN data were collected from Bresolin et al. (2010) and Magrini et al. (2010), and H ii region
data are from Magrini et al. (2010). The distributions of H ii regions and PNe extend up to R/R25 ≃ 1 (R∼
9 kpc). As said in the Introduction, in the sample of PNe we excluded those objects showing [Oiii]λ5007/Hβ
intensity ratio lower than 3 and consistently, for the H ii regions we excluded the objects showing this ratio larger
than 3. This is to avoid contamination by compact H ii regions in the PN sample and to avoid contamination
by supernova remnants, W-R nebulae and other highly excited objects in the H ii region sample. Our diagrams
then contain only genuine PNe and H ii regions.

The galactocentric distances employed to build the gradient diagrams were calculated by us, according to

the procedure described by Cioni (2009).

2.3. NGC 300

The almost face-on spiral NGC 300 is the less massive galaxy of the all sample studied here and the only
one out of the Local Group. Also it is the latest in terms of the Hubble type, SA(s)d. It is similar to M 33
in several aspects. Analysis of the H ii regions have been made by several authors. Bresolin et al. (2009) were
the ﬁrst to determine the oxygen abundance gradient based on direct-method abundance determinations, they
found ∆O/∆R = −0.077 dex kpc−1 with a central abundance of 12+log O/H ≃ 8.57.

Stasi´nska et al. (2013) analyzed the chemical gradients provided by H ii region and PN abundances ﬁnding

that gradients for PNe appear ﬂatter than those of H ii regions.

In this work we have re-analyzed the PN data presented by Stasi´nska et al. (2013), to make a comparison
of the case of NGC 300 with the other galaxies of the sample. Abundances presented by Stasi´nska et al. (2013)
were derived by adopting the ICFs proposed by Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994), and in this work we have used
the more recent ICFs presented by Delgado-Inglada, Morisset, & Stasi´nska (2014). With these new ICFs we
found that our O/H values are equal to the Stasi´nska et al. (2013) ones with diﬀerences lower than 0.03 dex,
Ne/H values show diﬀerences, in average, lower than 0.05 dex, while our Ar/H values are diﬀerent from those
by Stasi´nska et al. (2013) by 0.07 dex in average. Data for H ii regions are from Bresolin et al. (2009).

In this galaxy PNe and H ii regions have been found up to R/R25 ≃ 1 (R∼ 5 kpc). Galactocentric distances

were collected from the same authors as in the abundances.

2.4. Milky Way

Metallicity gradients have been widely studied in the MW by means of H ii regions, PNe, Cepheid stars, stel-
lar clusters and other objects. See e.g., Deharveng et al. (2000); Maciel, Costa, & Ushida (2003); Henry et al.
(2010); Stanghellini & Haywood (2018, 2010); Esteban et al. (2017); the compilation by Moll´a et al. (2019),
etc. The reported results for PNe have been contradictory. It has been claimed that the PN gradients coincide
with those of H ii regions or that the PN gradients are shallower, that gradients have ﬂattened (or steepened)
with time, or that the gradient changes of slope at certain distance from the galactic center. One of the main
problem in these determinations is the large uncertainties in the distances to PNe.

Determining the distance to galactic PNe is a diﬃcult task. The trigonometric parallax method is available
only for a handful of nearby objects. Even the parallaxes measured by GAIA are limited to distances of a few
kpc around the solar system, and in GAIA Data Release 2 less than a hundred PNe have conﬁdent measured
parallaxes (Kimeswenger & Barr´ıa 2018). Therefore, the distances for a large sample of PNe are based on model-
dependent statistical methods which in occasions lead to diﬀerent results. To the present the most used distance
scales are those proposed by Stanghellini & Haywood (2010), hereafter S10, and by Frew, Parker, & Boji˘ci´c

METALLICITY GRADIENTS

(2016), hereafter F16. The latter authors established a robust optical statistical distance indicator, the Hα
surface brightness vs. radius (SHα-r) indicator, where the intrinsic radius is calculated by using the angular
size, the integrated Hα ﬂux, and the reddening to the PNe. This radius, combined with the angular size, yields
directly the distance. On the other hand, S10 determine statistical distances based on apparent diameters and
5 Ghz ﬂuxes of PNe. A comparison of both distance scales are presented further below.

In this work we used PN chemical abundances reported by Henry, Kwitter, & Balick (2004), Milingo et al.
(2010), and Henry et al. (2010). These authors belong to the same group therefore all physical conditions
were calculated with the same systematical method and total chemical abundances were obtained using the
ICFs described in Kwitter & Henry (2001). The Galactic sample consists of 156 PNe covering galactocentric
distances in the range 0.21 kpc ≤ R ≤ 22.73 kpc (0.02 ≤ R/R25 ≤ 1.97). More than 40 of these PNe lie at
distances larger than the solar galactocentric distance and are crucial for the gradient determination.

In the case of H ii regions, oxygen abundances were taken from Esteban et al. (2017), while neon and ar-
gon abundances were collected from Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2004), Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2005), Garc´ıa-Rojas et al.
(2006), Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. (2007), Esteban et al. (2004), Esteban et al. (2013), and Fern´andez-Mart´ın et al.
(2017). As said above, the use of data processed by diﬀerent authors can introduce some inhomonogeneities
and uncertainties in the Ne and Ar gradients of H ii regions, that should be considered carefully.

In Fig. 6 we present the comparison of the metallicity gradients of oxygen, argon and neon for the Galactic
H ii regions and the PN sample. This ﬁgure will be discussed in detail in §3.4, here we want to show that
for the case of PNe we are using the distances by F16 and S10 for a comparison. As seen in this ﬁgure the
oxygen, neon, and argon abundances present a very large dispersion at all galactocentric distances, but the
linear regressions for PNe are similar for both distance indicators. Therefore in the following F16 distances will
be used as an independent way to compare with other works.

3. ABUNDANCE GRADIENTS

Abundance gradients of the diﬀerent elements for the diﬀerent galaxies were calculated by ﬁtting a straight
line to the abundances versus the fractional galactocentric distance R/R25 and also versus the distance R (kpc).
For each elemental abundance we computed one ﬁt for PNe and one for H ii regions. Gradients are shown in
the respective ﬁgures. In Table 2 a compendium of the abundance gradients versus galactocentric distance R
(kpc) is listed. For each ﬁt the table gives the values at the intercept, X0, and the slope, calculated in the
equation:

Y = X0 + ∆X/∆R × R (kpc).

Errors have been calculated at 1 sigma. The errors in the gradients of Ne and Ar are much larger than in O,
due to the large dispersion in the abundances at any galactocentric distance and due to the uncertainties in
the abundance determination because large ICFs are used for these elements.

3.1. M 31

In Fig. 1 the radial gradients for O/H , Ne/H and Ar/H , for PN and H ii region abundances are presented

vs. R/R25. The gradients vs. R (kpc) are presented in Table 2.

A linear ﬁt to the gradients is included in each case. The abundances of elements in PNe present a large
dispersion at any given galactocentric distance, but in particular in the central zone. It is worth to notice that
there are some PNe in the central region with very low O/H abundance, which do not have Ne/H or Ar/H
abundance determinations. H ii regions also present a large dispersion in the elemental abundances at any
galactocentric distance (Zurita & Bresolin 2012; Sanders et al. 2012).
For the case of O in H ii regions, it is obtained:

12+log(O)H) = (8.76±0.10) − (0.679 ± 0.153) R/R25

or equivalently

12+log(O/H) = (8.76±0.10) − (0.030±0.007) R (kpc).

The O gradient found is equal within uncertainties to one derived by Zurita & Bresolin (2012).
For Ne, we ﬁnd 12+log(Ne/H) = (7.99±0.23) − (0.036±0.016) R (kpc), and for Ar, we ﬁnd 12+log(Ar/H) =
(6.38±0.018) − (0.021±0.013) R (kpc)
In all the cases, the errors correspond to 1 sigma

6

PE ˜NA, & FLORES-DUR ´AN

PN abundances seem not related to the galactocentric distance and the PN gradients are really ﬂat, showing
slopes of −0.001 ± 0.001 dex kpc−1 for O, −0.002 ± 0.001 dex kpc−1 for Ne, and −0.002 ± 0.001 dex kpc−1 for
Ar, which considering the errors, are consistent with 0. This indicates that at large galactocentric distances
PNe present in average the same O/H abundances that in the central zones and the same is true for Ar and
Ne.

The O/H value at the intercept for H ii regions, 12+log O/H = 8.76±0.10, seems slightly larger than the
value for PNe, 12+log O/H = 8.46±0.03, while Ne/H and Ar/H central values are similar for H ii regions and
PNe, within uncertainties. However, due to the negative gradients for H ii regions, at large distances (R ≤
R25,) O/H, Ne/H and Ar/H abundances in PNe are always larger than abundances in H ii regions.

The larger value of O at the intercept for H ii regions seems an artifact due to the limited sample by
Zurita & Bresolin (2012) which moreover present large uncertainties. In addition, there are a large number of
PNe with low O abundances in the central zone, with no Ne and Ar measurement, that could be contributing
to the low O/H central value for PNe. In this zone a very large dispersion is observed.

In the central zone the value at R=0 of log Ne/O = −0.77 in H ii regions is about solar and discards the
possibility indicated by Zurita & Bresolin (2012) of a large O depletion in dust grains. On the other hand, Ne
in H ii regions is similar to Ne in PNe in the central zone. Relative to Ar, log Ar/O (H ii) = −2.38 and log
Ar/O (PNe) = −2.24 which correspond well with the solar or Orion values.

In Fig. 2 we show the abundance gradients for PNe separated in Peimbert types. Peimbert (1978) called
Type I those PNe with N/O abundance ratio larger than 0.5 and He/H abundance ratio larger than 0.14. This
group includes the PNe with central stars with initial mass larger than about 3.0 M⊙ and therefore they are
the youngest objects among PNe. They have enriched their nitrogen abundances in nucleosynthesis processes
such as CNO and hot-bottom-burning (HBB) and the newly formed N has been transported to the surface in
diﬀerent dredge-up events. In the Galaxy, Type I PNe belong to the thin disk and their ages are about 1 Gyr.
Non-Type I PNe include the Peimbert Types II and III PNe which are classiﬁed based on their radial velocity,
smaller or larger than 60 km s−1, and are located in the thick disk. They correspond to older objects with
initial masses lower than 2 M⊙, where no such a large N-enrichment is appreciated. Their ages are between 2
to 8 Gyr.

Thus our Fig. 2 represents an eﬀort to determine the behavior of the abundance gradient with time. It
is evident that although the gradients are very ﬂat and the uncertainties are large, Type I PNe show slightly
steeper gradients for the three elements: O, Ne and Ar. Additionally, Type I PNe seem to be O-poorer than
non-Type I, possible showing the eﬀect of CNO and HBB processes which operates in these massive stars. This
phenomenon will be discuss with more detail in §4.1.

It should be mentioned here that the value for N/O abundance ratio, to deﬁne a Peimbert Type I PN is
slightly dependent on the metallicity. The N/O ratio deﬁned by Peimbert (1978) applies to the metallicities
of the Milky Way and M 31, and should be slightly lower for M 33 and NGC 300, but the diﬀerence is not
important for this work and the results are not much aﬀected.

We will discuss the results for M 31 in sections ahead, together with the results for the other galaxies.

3.2. M 33

Metallicity gradients for H ii regions and PNe in M 33 are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. In the latter one,
PNe are separated in Peimbert Type I and non-Type I objects. Diﬀerently to what happens in M 31, in this
galaxy O, Ne and Ar abundances of PNe and H ii regions are similar within uncertainties, at any galactocentric
distance.

For PNe the straight-line ﬁt of the gradients gives 12+log O/H = (8.34±0.07) −(0.038 ± 0.016) R (kpc) and
for H ii regions, 12+log O/H= (8.48±0.03)−(0.047±0.008) R (kpc). That is, the slope for PNe seems shallower
than the slope in H ii regions, by about 30% for O and larger factors for Ne and Ar, but the uncertainties are
large making these results not conclusive. However we consider indicative that PN gradients are shallower.

In Fig. 4, the gradients of PNe with diﬀerent Peimbert Types are shown. There are only a few Type I PNe
in the sample (about 20%) and the uncertainties are very large, however the central values can be considered
equal within errors, for both PN types. Despite the uncertainties, slightly steeper gradients are apparent for
Type I PNe, while the gradients for non-Type I PNe are ﬂatter. The slopes shown by Type I PNe are more
similar to the ones presented by H ii regions. The huge uncertainties in these results make them not conclusive,

METALLICITY GRADIENTS

but only indicative. We consider them conﬁdent because M 33 would be showing similar results to M 31 and
NGC 300.

3.3. NGC 300

PN data in this galaxy were analyzed by Stasi´nska et al. (2013) where O, Ne, S and Ar abundance gradients
were presented. These authors found that the formal O/H, NeH and Ar/H abundance slopes for PNe are
shallower than those of H ii regions and attributed this to a steepening of the metallicity gradients during the
last Gyr. The O/H central value in PNe is smaller by 0.15 dex than the central value of H ii regions. Ne/H
and Ar/H on the other hand present the same central abundances in PNe and H ii regions, and almost ﬂat
gradients, although aﬀected by large dispersion at any galactocentric distance. According to Stasi´nska et al.
(2013), due to the diﬀerence in the O/H value at R=0, O abundances in PNe could have been aﬀected by
nucleosynthesis of their central stars.

Our analysis of these data, calculated with the ICFs by Delgado-Inglada, Morisset, & Stasi´nska (2014)
shows similar results that are presented in Fig. 5. O, Ne and Ar metallicity gradients for PNe in NGC 300 are
ﬂatter than the values of H ii regions. Their ∆X/∆R values are about half the values found for H II regions, in
very good agreement with the results by Stasi´nska et al. (2013). At the central zone, H ii regions show 12+log
O/H = 8.57±0.03, log Ne/O = −0.86±0.008 and log Ar/O= −2.20±0.07, these abundance ratios are similar
to solar or Orion values, while PNe present values 12+log O/H= 8.37±0.03, log Ne/O =−0.73±0.06, and log
Ar/O = −2.06±0.05, ratios also similar to the solar and Orion values but showing an apparent O decrease by
0.2 dex, relative to the O in H ii regions, as it was already indicated by Stasi´nska et al. (2013). This will be
discussed in §4. The central values of Ne/H and Ar/H are similar for PNe and H ii regions.

In this case, an analysis discriminating between the Peimbert Type PNe is not possible, because there are

very few Type I PNe in the sample.

3.4. The Milky Way

As said above metallicity gradients have been widely studied in the MW by means of many kind of objects.

See references in §2.4.

Henry et al. (2010), using distances by Cahn, Kaler, & Stanghellini (1992) derived an O gradient for PNe of
−0.058±0.006 dex kpc−1, which changes to −0.042±0.004 dex kpc−1 if the distances by Stanghellini, Shaw, & Villaver
(2015) are used. Henry et al. (2010) suggested that the gradient steepens beyond a galactocentric distance of
10 kpc. In a recent work, Stanghellini & Haywood (2018), using distances given by S10, reported that out to
R/R25 ≃ 2.4 (R ∼ 28 kpc) the radial gradient of oxygen for PNe is shallow, with slope ∼ −0.02 dex kpc−1 and
a central abundance of 12+log(O/H)≃ 8.68. These authors suggest that the gradient changes with R in the
sense that the signiﬁcant slope is limited to R between 10 and 13.5 kpc and outside this range the gradient is
almost ﬂat.

We analyzed the gradients derived from the data for PNe and H ii regions mentioned in §2.4. PN abundances
were calculated by us in a homogeneous way. The results are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. In the latter ﬁgure
the data have been binned in distance taking bins of 1 kpc, for clarity. The distances by F16 are used for PNe.
Clearly, PN gradients are ﬂatter that those of H ii regions. ∆X/∆R is about twice larger for H ii regions
(see Fig. 7 and Table 2). The binning of data with distances have introduced an artifact in Fig. 7 in the sense
that O and Ne abundances for PNe seem larger than the values for H ii regions, at R=0. But this does not
occur in Fig. 6 where the original data, not binned, were used. In these graphs it is observed that the O and
Ne values at the central zones coincide for PNe and H ii regions, within uncertainties, while Ar/H abundance
is lower in PNe by 0.7 dex. However due to the shallower gradients for PNe, at galactocentric distances larger
than a few kpc, the average abundances in PNe are larger than in H ii regions, similarly to what happens in
M 31 and NGC 300. By the way, this can explain part of the results by Rodr´ıguez & Delgado-Inglada (2011)
who found that in the solar vicinity, PNe appear richer than H ii regions.

The gradients derived for PNe of diﬀerent Peimbert types are shown in Fig. 8. In this case, gradients of
Type I and non-Type I PNe are equal within uncertainties. A possible change in the slope, at R∼ 14 kpc, is
appreciated that will be discussed in the next section.

We used the known GAIA distances of PNe to analyze the gradient for PNe. Using the same set of
abundances of the MW, we searched for those PNe that have calculated parallaxes on GAIA Data Release 2

8

PE ˜NA, & FLORES-DUR ´AN

(GAIA DR2). We did not take into account those objects with negative parallax and error in parallax (dp/p)
bigger than 0.4. We found 22 PNe meeting these requirements. No gradient is found in this interval for the
three analyzed elements, because GAIA galactocentric distances are limited from 6 to 10 kpc, and this interval
is too short to show any gradient, due to the large dispersion in abundances.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The radial gradients of the elements O, Ne and Ar are analyzed for homogeneous samples of PNe and H ii
regions in four disk galaxies of diﬀerent Hubble type, diﬀerent masses and diﬀerent metallicities, M 31, M 33,
NGC 300 and the Milky Way. A compendium of our results, with all the linear ﬁts and slopes ∆X/∆R in dex
kpc−1, is presented in Table 2. In the following we discuss the results.

4.1. M 31

Our work extends the PN sample, including objects from 2 kpc up to a distance larger than 100 kpc (0.2 –
5 R25). In this interval the abundance gradients for PNe are ﬂat, consistent with a slope of zero. The average
abundances of PNe are the same at all galactocentric distances, showing a very large dispersion.

On the other hand the gradients for H ii regions are always negative, with values −0.030 ± 0.010 dex kpc−1
for O, −0.036 ± 0.016 dex kpc−1 for Ne and −0.021 ± 0.013 dex kpc−1 for Ar. These slopes are much shallower
than the slopes in the other three galaxies. The very ﬂat gradients found in M 31 could indicate, according
to S´anchez et al. (2014), that M 31 has been perturbed by interactions or merging.
It is clear that these
phenomena have had an important role in the formation and growth of M 31, a galaxy that shows numerous
stellar substructures in its outskirts (McConnachie et al. 2009, and references therein).

At the central position PNe appear to have an average O/H abundance slightly lower than the average in
H ii regions, but similar Ne/H and Ar/H abundances. This could be due to the presence of several PNe with
very low O abundance (and not known Ne and Ar) in the central region, as it was explained in §3.1

The same as it is found in our work, Sanders et al. (2012) and Magrini et al. (2016) reported that the
O/H gradient from PN abundances is ﬂat in M 31. Sanders et al. (2012) in particular, from the analysis of O
abundances in 52 PNe, derived with the direct-method, located at galactocentric distance from 5 to 25 kpc (0.2
to 1.2 R25), mentioned that there is no relation between PN abundances and their galactocentric distances.
This same PN sample was re-analyzed by Magrini et al. (2016) who reported that radial migration plays an
important role in PNe of M 31, which possibly explains the extreme ﬂatness of PNe gradients, since PNe may
have migrated far from their place of origin.

When the sample is divided in Peimbert Type I PNe (young objects) and non-Type I PNe (older objects),
it is found that the young objects show a steeper gradient, although still very ﬂat (Fig. 2 ). Due to their youth
(ages lower than about 1 Gyr), Type I PNe have had less time to migrate from their birth places, then they
might be showing the gradient at about 1 Gyr ago, but considering that these gradients are very ﬂat compared
to the ones of H ii regions, migration should have had an important role for these young PNe too.

It is important to mention that the results found for M 31 corroborate models of galactic chemical evolution,
which besides including the star formation rate, gas infall rate accross the disk, inﬂows and outﬂows of gas,
stellar evolution and yields, among other processes, also include radial redistribution of stars (stellar migration).
Models by Ruiz-Lara et al. (2017) predict that radial redistribution and accretion increase the metallicity
dispersion, and ﬂatten the age and metallicity proﬁles of galaxies; the greater the eﬃciency of the redistribution,
the larger the ﬂattening eﬀect and, as a consequence, steeper metallicity gradient should be expected at birth
of the objects. Being Type I PNe closer to their birth places, they show steeper gradients.

Peimbert Type I PNe present slightly lower O abundances than non-Type I’s, while Ne and Ar abundances
are similar. This can be due to nucleosynthesis because CNO and HBB processes are expected to occur in these
more massive central stars modifying their initial O abundance. Such an O decrease is predicted by recent
sophisticated evolutionary stellar models for low-intermediate mass stars of the MW, computed at diﬀerent
metallicities, by Ventura et al. (2017). Using the sequence of models with z ∼ 0.014 (solar metallicity) it is
found that stars with masses larger than 3 M⊙ diminish their O/H abundance by up to 0.2 dex at the end of
their evolution, while stars of lower masses do not modify their original O/H. This is the eﬀect we are ﬁnding
in the comparison of Type I and non-Type I PNe in M 31.

4.2. M 33

In the case of M 33, a late Hubble-type galaxy, the results are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. In this case O,
Ne and Ar in PNe show similar central values to the values of H ii regions therefore there is not important
enrichment of the ISM since the time of formation of these PNe. Similarly, the O abundance gradients of PNe
and H ii regions are equal, within uncertainties, but the Ne and Ar abundance slopes in PNe seem signiﬁcantly
ﬂatter, although the large dispersion and large uncertainties make these results doubtful.

Due to the similarity of metallicity gradients and the large dispersion, Magrini, Stanghellini, & Villaver
(2009) claimed that gradients are equal for PNe and H ii regions. In a recent paper, Magrini et al. (2016) ana-
lyzed the possible eﬀects of radial migration in M 33 and concluded that it is not important. Also Bresolin et al.
(2010) declared that PNe and H ii regions have equal gradients within uncertainties, but an analysis of their
Table 8 shows that the slopes for PNe are systematically ﬂatter than the slopes of H ii regions, even when the
uncertainties are large.

It is interesting to notice that PNe in M 33 do not show O reduction compared to H ii regions, as occurs in
NGC 300 (see next section), despite the similar low metallicity in both galaxies. It seems that the initial masses
of the central stars in this galaxy are not as large as in NGC 300, thus they are not aﬀected by nucleosynthesis
in the same way as in NGC 300. According to Ventura et al. (2016) models, the initial masses should have
been not much larger than 2 M⊙.

Although the uncertainties are huge due to the low number of objects, Type I PNe in M 33 seem to present
slopes steeper than non-Type I PNe, and more similar to the ones of H ii regions. Again these results are very
uncertain, but we consider them indicative of the similar phenomenon ocurring in M 31.

4.3. NGC 300

For NGC 300, the latest Hubble-type galaxy, with metallicity similar to M 33, the abundance gradients of
PNe are about twice smaller than the gradients of H ii regions (see Fig. 5). The gradients presented by H ii
regions are the largest (∆O / ∆R = -0.077±0.008 dex kpc−1) in the whole galaxy sample.

The average O/H central abundance of PNe is lower than the value in H ii regions by 0.2 dex, while Ne and
Ar have the same central values. Such an O decrease, which does not occur in Ne and Ar, could be the result
of stellar nucleosynthesis and dregde-up events. Stellar evolution models performed by Ventura et al. (2016)
for PNe in the SMC (which has a metallicity similar to the NGC 300 one) predict a decreasing of the initial
O occurring in stars with masses larger than 3 M⊙, due to HBB, simultaneously a large N-enrichment occurs.
Such N-enrichment is observed in the PNe of NGC 300 (Stasi´nska et al. 2013). Therefore we conclude that the
central stars of PNe analyzed in this galaxy had in general large initial masses and are younger than 1–2 Gyr.
This is certainly due to a bias in the sample because only the brightest objects were observed at the NGC 300
distance (Pe˜na et al. 2012).

The central values of Ne/H and Ar/H are similar for PNe and H ii regions. Once again this indicates that

PNe are young objects which had initial abundances similar to the present ISM.

An interesting fact is that at R/R25 larger than 0.6, Ar/H abundances of PNe are deﬁnitely larger than the
values of H ii regions, independent of the large dispersion. This is also found for Ne, but less marked. Since Ar
it is not expected to have been modiﬁed by stellar nucleosynthesis of central stars, this is indicating that radial
migration should have been important in PNe (despite their youth) and that PNe have changed their initial
galactocentric distances, being churned in the galaxy, although not at the level of migration found in M 31.

4.4. The Milky Way

The results for the MW are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. The latter ﬁgure shows PNe data with a bin of 1
kpc in distance. The PN sample covers a galactocentric distance interval 0.21 kpc ≤ R ≤ 22.73 kpc (0.02≤
R/R25 ≤1.97). The gradient obtained for O in PNe is −0.024 dex kpc−1, similar to the ones derived for Ne
and Ar. As occurs in M 31, and NGC 300, PN gradients are ﬂatter, by about a factor of 2, than the gradients
of H ii regions.

The gradients for Type I and non-Type I PNe are shown in Fig. 8. In this ﬁgure the slopes of both kind of
nebulae seem indistinguishable. Our result is diﬀerent from what it was reported by Stanghellini & Haywood
(2010) and Stanghellini & Haywood (2018) for their young and old PN samples, using the distances by S10.

10

PE ˜NA, & FLORES-DUR ´AN

They claim that young PNe deﬁnitely present a steeper gradient of −0.027 dex kpc−1 versus −0.015 dex kpc−1
for old PNe. We are not sure if our diﬀerent result is due to the diﬀerent PN samples (a much larger sample
from the literature, not homogenized, was used by Stanghellini & Haywood (2018)) or the diﬀerent distance
In any case we coincide with them in that PN gradients are ﬂatter than those of H ii regions,
scale used.
therefore it appears than PNe have moved from their birth places due to radial migration and are showing
ﬂatter gradients. Alternatively it is possible that the abundance gradients were ﬂatter several Gyr ago.

Although a linear ﬁt to these gradients produces acceptable results, it should be noticed that at distances
larger than about 14 kpc, the observed abundances (in particular O/H and Ar/H) decrease to a value below
the linear ﬁt and continue ﬂat outwards, marking a step. Unfortunately in our sample there are few PNe out
of these distances and this result is not conclusive. The same step at a distance R∼13.5 kpc, was reported
by Stanghellini & Haywood (2018) from the same sample of outer PNe. Following Halle et al. (2015) they
attributed this behavior to the eﬀect of the galactic bar whose outer Lindblad resonance would be located at
about this distance according to N-body simulations for the galaxy. It is crucial to observe a larger number of
PNe in the outskirts of the Galaxy to verify this behavior.

It is interesting to compare the gradients of H ii regions (−0.040 dex kpc−1) and PNe (−0.024 dex kpc−1)
with others provided by well measured indicators of diﬀerent ages. Moll´a et al. (2019) have prepared a compila-
tion of gradients for diﬀerent objects of diﬀerent ages, computed by diﬀerent authors, in order to compare them
with results from their chemical evolution models. From this compilation we select the gradients calculated by
Moll´a et al. for Cepheid stars which are young objects with ages of about 0.1 Gyr, showing an O/H gradient
of −0.049 dex kpc−1, and open clusters (OC) which span ages from 2 to more than 8 Gyr. The O/H gradient
for OC with ages younger than 2 Gyr is −0.030 dex kpc−1, and for ages between 2 and more than 8 Gyr,
the slope is −0.027 dex kpc−1. It is clear that the gradient of H ii regions and Cepheid stars are equal within
uncertainties indicating that in the Galaxy the chemical gradients have not changed signiﬁcantly in at least the
last 0.1 Gyr, while gradients of PNe (Type I’s and non-Type I’s) are equal to that of OC with ages older than
2 Gyr. Therefore for objects of 2–8 Gyr the gradient is ﬂatter (−0.027 dex kpc−1) than those of Cepheids and
H ii regions (−0.049 and −0.040 dex kpc−1). PNe and OC certainly could have been aﬀected by migration, but
not in an as extreme way as in M 31. Alternatively, PN and OC gradients could represent the true gradients
at several Gyr ago.

In Moll´a et al. (2019) it is discussed the possible eﬀects of migration in the MW. By analyzing models by
diﬀerent authors, their conclusion is that radial migration seems to be not important for stars younger than 4
Gyr. Only for objects older than 8 Gyr, radial migration may be important. Models by Moll´a et al. of time
evolution of chemical gradients in the Milky Way (without considering migration, bar or spiral arms) predict
a very smooth evolution of the radial gradient within the optical disk. Some model show a steepening of the
gradient, from −0.02 to −0.04 dex kpc−1 from time equal to 10 Gyr until the present. Therefore the gradients
presented by PNe and OC could be the gradients at the time of formation of these objects, not aﬀected by
migration.

5. CONCLUSIONS

From the analysis of abundance gradients of O, Ne, and Ar in PNe and H ii regions in the four galaxies,
it is found that in NGC 300 (a late Hubble-type spiral of low metallicity) and the Milky Way, the abundance
gradients for PNe are ﬂatter than those of H ii regions, by factors of 2. This result is less conclusive in the case
of M 33, but also slightly ﬂatter gradients are found for PNe than for H ii regions.

M 31 represents an extreme case where PN abundances are not related to the galactocentric distances and
present the same values at any distance from the center up to more than a 100 kpc. Merging, interactions with
other galaxies and important radial migration of PNe are causing this phenomenon in M 31. It is worth to
notice that considering the H ii regions, M 31 presents the shallower gradients of the four galaxies, which again
is a possible consequence of merging and interactions.

In the four galaxies analyzed here, there is a large dispersion on abundances at any galactocentric distance
which is larger for PNe than for H ii regions. This possibly is caused by migration. PNe could have been
churned in the galactic disk far from their birth places thus their abundances do not correspond to the place
where they presently are. In trying to understand this it is important to analyze the abundances of elements
that have been not modiﬁed by stellar nucleosynthesis, like Ar, as O and Ne can be modiﬁed depending on the

metallicity and the stellar mass. However Ar abundance determinations have large uncertainties, therefore the
results based on Ar only should be taken carefully.

When considering the PNe separated by Peimbert types, M 31 shows a clear case where the gradients
seem to be steepening with time since Type I PNe, which correspond to the youngest objects among the PN
population, with ages lower than 1 Gyr, present steeper slopes than non-Type I PNe, with ages between 2 to 9
Gyr. Type I PN gradients are more similar to, but still much ﬂatter than H ii region slopes. The gradients for
non-Type I PN are most probably altered by radial migration that have moved the old PNe from their initial
galactocentric position in the galaxy. Type I PNe, due to their youth, have had less time to migrate from their
place of birth, although the ﬂatness of their gradients also indicate perturbations due to migration.

In the Milky Way, H ii region and PNe gradients can be compared to the gradients of objects of similar
ages as Cepheid stars (age younger than 0.1 Gyr) and Open Clusters (ages between 2 and more than 8 Gyr).
H ii regions and Cepheid stars present the same O/H gradients, which indicates that the chemical enrichment
in the Galaxy has not increased in the last few hundreds of Myr. On the other hand PNe and Open Clusters
(OC) present similar gradients, ﬂatter than those of Cepheids and H ii regions. This could indicate that the
gradients steepen slowly with time (from −0.02 to −0.04 dex kpc−1 in several Gyr). Alternatively it could
indicate that radial migration could have perturbed the slopes presented by these relatively old disk objects.
Chemical evolution models for the Galaxy by Moll´a et al. (2019) seem to favor the ﬁrst option.

In the Milky Way a sort of step in the PN gradient seems to exist in the sense that inside R ∼ 14 kpc,
there is a measurable gradient of about −0.024 dex kpc−1 in the three elements. Outside this galactocentric
distance, PNe show a ﬂat slope. Stanghellini & Haywood (2018) reported the same phenomenon, based on the
same data for PNe in the outskirts. However there are only a handful of objects detected in this zone, and a
larger sample should be analyzed to conﬁrm this step in abundances.

In general, the central abundances of O, Ne and Ar of PNe are similar to the central abundances of H ii
regions (the diﬀerences could be of about 0.2 dex), indicating that the central enrichment has not been important
since the time of birth of PNe, and dust depletion of O in H ii regions is not large. Although, due to the ﬂat
gradients of PNe, at galactocentric distance larger than about 0.5 R/R25, the average abundances in PNe are

larger than the average abundances in H ii regions.

It is found that in PNe formed in low metallicity environment (Z ≤ 0.004, like in NGC 300), with initial
masses of about 3 M⊙ or larger, the oxygen could have been modiﬁed by stellar nucleosynthesis and its value
in the nebula does not represent the initial value at the time of stellar formation. This is not the case in
larger metallicity environments or in stars with lower initial masses. In the former case we suggest to use Ar
as an element showing the initial abundance in the nebula, in spite of Ar abundance determination has large
uncertainties.

Our results are very useful for the computation of chemical evolution models in these galaxies, as the present
ISM represented by H ii regions and the older component represented by PNe can be used for constraining the
models. Non-Type I PNe are very useful to analyze the eﬀect of radial migration in disk galaxies.
