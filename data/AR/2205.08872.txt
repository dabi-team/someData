Abstract

As a generalization of tilting pair, which was introduced by Miyashita in [16], the notion
of silting pair is introduced in this paper. The authors extends a characterization of tilting
modules given by Bazzoni [7, Theorem 3.11] to silting pairs, and proves that there is an one-
to-one correspondence between equivalent classes of silting pairs and certain subcategories
which satisfy some conditions. Furthermore, the authors also gives a bijection between
equivalent class of silting pairs and bounded above co-t-structure.

Introduction and Preliminaries

The tilting theory is well known and plays an important role in the representation theory of
Artin algebra. Beginning with Miyashita [15] and in turn Colby and Fuller [11], etc., ﬁnitely
generated tilting modules over arbitrary rings were studied. In the study of tilting modules over
Artin algebra, Miyashita introduced the notion of tilting pair in [16], i.e., if A is an Artin algebra
and C, T P A-mod (that is, the category of all ﬁnitely generated left A-modules), then the pair
pC, T q is tilting if both C and T are selforthogonal such that T P

As a generation of tilting theory, silting theory is a hot topic recently. Silting complexes (i.e.,
semi-tilting complexes in [21]) were ﬁrst introduced by Keller and Vossieck [13] in order to study
t-structures in the bounded derived category of representations of Dynkin quivers. In [3], the
authors introduced the notion of silting module and they proved that there is a bijection between
silting complexes and certain t-structure and co-t-structure in the derived module category. For
articles on the silting theory, interested readers can refer to [1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 14, 17, 19, 20, 25] etc.
The authors (Zhang and Wei) introduced three notions of cosilting complexes, cosilting modules
(simultaneously and independently with [8]) and AIR-cotilting modules, and it is proved that
they are the same in [24].

In this paper the authors introduces the new notion of silting pairs, gives a characterization
of silting pairs, proves that there is an one-to-one correspondence between equivalent classes of
silting pairs and certain subcategories which satisﬁes some conditions, and obtains a bijection
between silting pair and bounded above co-t-structure.

Let R be an ring. We denote by R-Mod the category of all left R-modules. We denote by
ProjR the class of all projective R-modules. The notation K bpProjRq denotes the homotopy cat-
egory of bounded complexes of projective modules. Denote by DpRq (resp. DbpRq) the category
of the unbounded (resp. bounded) derived category of complexes in R-Mod. Throughout this
paper we consider a triangulated category D with [1] the shift functor. Assume that B is a full
subcategory of D. Recall that B is closed under extensions if for any triangle X Ñ Y Ñ Z Ñ
in D with X, Z P B, we have Y P B. The subcategory B is suspended (resp. cosuspended)
r´1s). An object M P D
if it is closed under extensions and under the functor r1s (resp.
has a B-resolution (resp., B-coresolution) with the length at most m (m ě 0), if there are
triangles Mi`1 Ñ Xi Ñ Mi Ñ (resp., Mi Ñ Xi Ñ Mi`1 Ñ) with 0 ď i ď m such that
M0 “ M , Mm`1 “ 0 and each Xi P B. In this case, we denoted by B-res.dimpM q ď m (resp.,
B-cores.dimpM q ď m).

Next, given a subcategory B of D, we give the following notations which are widely used in

the tilting theory, where n ě 0 and m is an integer.

BK"0 “ tN P D | N P BKąm for some mu.

Moreover, for an object M P D, we deﬁne the class AddM “ tN P D| there exists L such that
N ‘ L “ M pXq for some set X u.
If the category B “ AddM , then we simply replace the
notation BKąm with M Kąm (the other situations are similar). Also, we need the following two
notions.

XM “ tN P Ką0M | there are triangles Ni Ñ Mi Ñ Ni`1 Ñ such that N0 “ N ,

Ni P Ką0M and Mi P AddM for all i ě 0u.

M X “ tN P M Ką0 | there are triangles Ni`1 Ñ Mi Ñ Ni Ñ such that N0 “ N ,

Ni P M Ką0 and Mi P AddM for all i ě 0u.

2 Silting pairs

Recall that an object M is said to be semi-selforthogonal if AddM Ď M Ką0. Firstly, we collect
some important results about semi-selforthogonal objects from the second section of [21] in the
following lemma.

Lemma 2.1 Let M be semi-selforthogonal in D. Then the following results hold.

p1q XM is closed under extensions, direct summands and r´1s;
p11q M X is closed under extensions, direct summands and r1s;
AddM , M Ką0ri ą 0sq “ 0;

Ką0M “

AddM Ş
{
We also need the following results.

AddM Ş M Ką0
­

AddM are closed under extensions and direct summands.
{

Lemma 2.2 Let M be semi-selforthogonal in D. Given any triangle X ÝÑ Y ÝÑ Z ÝÑ, then
the following results hold.

p1q If Y, Z P M X and HomDpM, Xr1sq “ 0, then X P M X ;
p2q If X, Y P XM and HomDpZ, M r1sq “ 0, then Z P XM .

Proof. (1) Since Z P M X , there is a triangle Z 1 ÝÑ M 1 ÝÑ Z ÝÑ with M 1 P AddM and Z 1 P
M X . Thus we have the following triangles commutative diagram:

Z 1

Z 1

X

X

/ U

/ Y

M 1

Z

By the lemma 2.1 (1’), we have that U P M X from the second column in diagram above. Since
HomDpM, Xr1sq “ 0, the second row is split. It follows from the lemma 2.1 (1’) that X P M X .
l

(2) The proof is dual to (1).

Let W Ď D be a subcategory closed under ﬁnite direct sums and summands. We say
that M is a relative generator of W, if M P W and for any W P W, there is a triangle
W 1 ÝÑ MW ÝÑ W ÝÑ with MW P AddM and W 1 P W. Dually, we can deﬁne the relative
cogenerator. For example, if M is semi-selforthogonal, then M X and
AddM (respectively, XM
{
and

AddM ) both have a relative generator (respectively, cogenerator) M .
­

The following lemma comes from the idea in [23, Lemma 2.2].

Lemma 2.3 Let W be a subcategory of D. Assume that W contains a semi-selforthogonal
relative generator M and is closed under extensions, ﬁnite direct sums and direct summands. If
there are triangles Xi`1 ÝÑ Yi ÝÑ Xi ÝÑ with each Yi P W for any 1 ď i ď n, then there exist
Un and Vn`1 satisfying the following two conditions:

p1q there is a triangle Un ÝÑ Vn`1 ÝÑ Xn`1 ÝÑ with Un P W;
p2q there are triangles Vi`1 ÝÑ Zi ÝÑ Vi ÝÑ with Zi P AddM for any 1 ď i ď n and

V1 “ X1.

Moreover, if X1 P W, then there is a triangle Un ÝÑ Vn`1 ÝÑ Xn`1 ÝÑ with Un P W and

Vn`1 P p

AddM qn.

Proof. By induction on n. When n “ 1, we have a triangle X2 ÝÑ Y1 ÝÑ X1 ÝÑ with Y1 P W.
Thus there is a triangle U1 ÝÑ Z1 ÝÑ Y1 ÝÑ with Z1 P AddM and U1 P W. So we have the
following triangles commutative diagram:

U1

V2

U1

Z1

X1

X2

Y1

X1

It is easy to see that the left column and the middle row are just the desired triangles.

Assume that the result holds for n ´ 1. Then there exist Un´1 and Vn such that there is a
triangle Un´1 ÝÑ Vn ÝÑ Xn ÝÑ with Un´1 P W and Vi`1 ÝÑ Zi ÝÑ Vi ÝÑ with Zi P AddM
for any 1 ď i ď n ´ 1 and V1 “ X1. Consequently, we can obtain the following triangles
commutative diagram:

Un´1

Un´1

Xn`1

/ A

Xn`1

/ Yn

Vn

Xn

It follows, since W is closed under extensions, that A is in W. So we have a triangle Un ÝÑ
Zn ÝÑ A ÝÑ with Zn P AddM and Un P W. Then we can construct the following triangles
commutative diagram:

Un

Vn`1

Xn`1

Un

Zn

A

Vn

Vn

So we complete this proof.

Moreover, if X1 P W, then there is a triangle X 1

1 ÝÑ M 1 ÝÑ X1 ÝÑ with M 1 P AddM and

X 1

1 P W. We have the following triangles commutative diagram:

It follows, since W is closed under extensions, that B P W. Replace the triangle X2 ÝÑ Y1 ÝÑ
X1 ÝÑ with the triangle X2 ÝÑ B ÝÑ M 1 ÝÑ, we can obtain the conclusion from (1) and (2).

Lemma 2.4 Assume that M is a semi-selforthogonal object in D. If there are triangles Xi´1 ÝÑ
AddM qn, for any 1 ď i ď n, then there exist Un and Vn satisfying
Yi ÝÑ Xi ÝÑ with each Yi P p
­
the following two conditions:

p1q there is a triangle Xn ÝÑ Vn ÝÑ Un ÝÑ with Un P p
p2q there are triangles Vi´1 ÝÑ Zi ÝÑ Vi ÝÑ with Zi P AddM for any 1 ď i ď n and

Proof. The proof is dual to Lemma 2.3.

Proposition 2.5 Let M be a semi-selforthogonal object in D. Then

Proof. By Lemma 2.1 (2) in [22] and Lemma 2.1 (1’).

Next, we give the deﬁnition of silting pair and some useful properties.

Deﬁnition 2.6 A pair pC, Sq is silting if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

p1q C is semi-selforthogonal;
p2q S is semi-selforthogonal;
p3q C P
p4q S P

AddS;
­
AddC.
{

Let R be a ring and DbpRq be its bounded derived category. We say that a complex T is said
to be small silting [21, Deﬁnition 3.1] if it satisﬁes the following conditions: piq T P KbpprojRq,
piiq T is semi-selforthogonal, and piiiq KbpprojRq “ xaddT y, i.e., KbpprojRq coincides with the
smallest triangulated subcategory containing addT , where addT “ tM P D| there exists N such
that N ‘ M “ T pXq for some ﬁnite set X u. From the deﬁnition of silting pair, the following
are obvious:

p1q If C is semi-selforthogonal, then pC, Cq is a silting pair;
p2q If T P Dď0 (the complexes whose homologies are concentrated on non-positive terms) is
a small silting complex, then pR, T q is a silting pair by the small version of Theorem 3.5 in [21];

p3q If T is a tilting complex, then pR, T q is a silting pair;
p4q If M is a tilting R-module, then pR, M q is a silting pair by the small version of Corollary

3.7 in [21].

In DbpAq, we take C “ 110 ‘ 100, S “ 100 ‘ 010r1s, it is easy to see that both C and S are
semi-selforthogonal, and there is a triangle 110 ÝÑ 100 ÝÑ 010r1s ÝÑ. So the pair pC, Sq is
silting.

From the following the lemma, we will give the deﬁnition of n-silting pair.

Lemma 2.8 Let the pair pC, Sq be silting and m be a positive integer. Then C P p

Proof. pðùq: Assume that C P p
AddSqn and n ą m. Thus there are triangles Ci ÝÑ Si ÝÑ
­
Ci`1 ÝÑ with Si P AddS for any 0 ď i ď n ´ 1, where C0 “ C and Cn “ Sn. Using the
functor HomDpCn, ´q to these triangles, we have that HomDpCn, Cn´1r1sq – HomDpCn, C0rnsq
by dimension shifting. By the lemma 2.1 (4) and (3), we have that HomDpCn, Cn´1r1sq –
HomDpCn, C0rnsq “ 0. Thus the triangle Cn´1 ÝÑ Sn´1 ÝÑ Cn ÝÑ is split. It follows that
C P p

AddSqn´1. Repeating this process, we ﬁnally obtain that C P p

p1q the pair pC, Sq is silting;

Proof. (1) Easily.

(2) Taking T P SX , there are triangles Ti`1 ÝÑ Si ÝÑ Ti ÝÑ with Si P AddS for any i ě 0,
where T0 “ T and Tj P SX for any j ą 0. Since CX is closed under extensions, Si P CX for
any i ě 1. Note that CX is closed under ﬁnite direct sums by Lemma 3.11 from [21]. By the
lemma 2.3, thus we can obtain a triangle U0 ÝÑ V1 ÝÑ T1 ÝÑ with U0 P CX such that there
is a triangle V1 ÝÑ C0 ÝÑ T0 ÝÑ with C0 P AddC. Thus, we have the following triangles

Since Si and U0 are in CX , Y P CX from the second in above diagram. Then there is a triangle

commutative diagram:

Now, we have obtained two triangles V1 ÝÑ C0 ÝÑ T0 ÝÑ and V2 ÝÑ C1 ÝÑ V1 ÝÑ.
Repeating the process for the triangle U1 ÝÑ V2 ÝÑ T2 ÝÑ, we can get a triangle V3 ÝÑ
l
C2 ÝÑ V2 ÝÑ. Keep repeating, we can know that T P CX . i.e., SX Ď C X .

In order to give a characterization of n-silting pairs, we need to introduce the following
subcategory. Let B and C be two subcategories of D and let n be a positive integer. We denote
by

Presn

C pBq := tX P D| there exist triangles Xi ÝÑ Ti´1 ÝÑ Xi´1 ÝÑ with Ti P B for
any 1 ď i ď n, where X0 “ X and Xn P Cu.

If the category B “ AddT , then we simply replace the notation Presn

C pBq with Presn

C pT q.

Proposition 2.11 Assume that the pair pC, Sq is n-silting and T P D. Then the following
statements are equivalent.

Lemma 2.2. So T1 P SKą0

Proof. (1) By the lemma 2.12, we only need to prove that Presn

Taking any T P Presn

3 Relative AR-correspondence and co-t-structure

Auslander and Reiten showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism
classes of basic cotilting modules and certain contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategories [6].
Extending this result, Buan [10] showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
basic cotilting complexes and certain contravariantly ﬁnite subcategories of the bounded derived
category of an artin algebra. In [24], the authors extended such a result to cosilting complexes.
In this section, the author’s mainly proof consists in that there is also an AR-correspondence
with respect to the silting pair. Furthermore, the authors gives a bijection between silting pair
and bounded above co-t-structure.

Firstly, we give the following notions. Let A Ď B be two subcategories of D. A is said to
be covariantly ﬁnite in B, if for any B P B, there is a homomorphism f : B Ñ A for some
A P A such that HomDpf, A1q is surjective for any A1 P A. Moreover, A is said to be specially
covariantly ﬁnite in B, if for any B P B, there is a triangle B Ñ A Ñ C Ñ with some A P A
such that HomDpC, A1r1sq “ 0 for any A1 P A. Note that in the latter case, one has that C P
Ką0A if A is closed under r1s.

Recall that X ˚ Y denotes the class of objects Z P D for which there is a triangle X ÝÑ
Z ÝÑ Y ÝÑ with X P X and Y P Y. A pair pA, Bq of subcategories in D is said to be a
co-t-structure on D (see [18]) if the following statements hold: (1) A is closed under [-1] and B
is closed under [1]; (2) HomDpAr´1s, Bq “ 0; (3) D “ Ar´1s ˚ B. Moreover, the co-t-structure
pA, Bq on D is said to be bounded above (see [12]) if ŤiPZ Bris “ D.

The following lemma is the dual of Corollary 2.3 in [24]. For the reader’s convenience, we

give a proof here.

Lemma 3.1 Assume that S is semi-selforthogonal. For any L P

X ÝÑ Y ÝÑ L ÝÑ with X P SX , Y P p
AddSqn by Lemma 2.7 in [21]. And then there is a
­
triangle Y ÝÑ B0 ÝÑ V ÝÑ with V P p
AddSqn´1 and B0 P AddS. We have the following

Note that X P SX Ď SKą0 and B0 P SKą0. So the ﬁrst row and the third column are just the

Proposition 3.2 If the pair pC, Sq is silting, then we have the following three conclusions:

C Ką0 by Lemma 2.10. Applying the functor HomDpC, ´q to these triangles, we have that
0 “ HomDpC, Xnr1sq – HomDpC, Mnr1sq – ¨ ¨ ¨ – HomDpC, M rn ` 1sq by dimension shifting,
and then M P C K"0. i.e.,

For the reverse inclusion, if N P C K"0, then we have that L “ N rts P C Ką0 for some t ą 0.
We claim that there exists some s ą 0 such that Lrss P SKą0. Indeed, since S P
AddC, there
{
exist some triangles Si ÝÑ Ci´1 ÝÑ Si´1 ÝÑ with Ci P AddC for any 1 ď i ď s ` 1, where
S0 “ S and Ss`1 “ 0. Applying the functor HomDp´, Lq to these triangles, we have that
0 “ HomDpCs, Lr1sq – HomDpSs, Lr1sq – ¨ ¨ ¨ – HomDpS, Lrs ` 1sq by dimension shifting, and
then L P SKąs. i.e., Lrss P SKą0 for some s ą 0. So N rs ` ts P SKą0. Since
SKą0 is closed under

not diﬃcult to verify that HomDpV, SKą0r1sq “ 0 by dimension shifting. Consequently, SKą0 is
specially covariantly ﬁnite in C K"0.

For any X P C K"0, there is a triangle Ar´1s ÝÑ X ÝÑ B ÝÑ A with B P SKą0 and
HomDpA, SKą0r1sq “ 0 by (2), then A P K0pSKą0qr1s Ş C K"0. So C K"0 “ K0pSKą0qr1s Ş C K"0 ˚
SKą0, i.e., pK0pSKą0qr1s Ş C K"0, SKą0q is a co-t-structure on C K"0.

It is not diﬃcult to verify that SKą0 is suspended. By Lemma 2.1 in [22], we have

Thus, it is bounded above.

Since Mn`1 P Ką0Y and M P pKą0YqKąn, HomDpMn`1, Mnr1sq “ 0. i.e., the triangle Mn ÝÑ

Thus S P CX . If S P KątpC Ką0q for some t, then S P

Corollary 3.5 Assume that C is semi-selforthogonal and the subcategory Y Ď C Ką0 is closed
under direct sums. If pX , Yq is a bounded above co-t-structure on C K"0, then there is a silting
pair pC, Sq such that Y “ SKą0.

Proof. For any A P C K"0, there is a triangle Xr´1s ÝÑ A ÝÑ Y ÝÑ X with X P X and
Y P Y. Obviously, HomDpX, Y 1r1sq “ 0 for all Y 1 P Y. Thus Y is specially covariantly ﬁnite in
C K"0. It follows from Proposition 2.1 in [18] that Y is suspended. By the lemma 2.1 in [22] and
the assumption, we have

Yris “ C K"0.

Y “ ď

iPZ

Consequently, Y satisﬁes the conditions of Proposition 3.4, and then there is a silting pair pC, Sq
such that Y “ SKą0.
l

Lemma 3.6 If the pair pC, Sq is an n-silting pair, then SKą0 “ Presn

CKą0 pSq.

Proof. By the lemma 3.11 from [21] and Proposition 2.11.

l

Two n-silting pairs pC, Sq and pC, T q are said to be equivalent if AddS “ AddT . By
Proposition 3.2 and Proposition 3.4, we can obtain the AR-correspondence with respect to
silting pair as follows.

Theorem 3.7 If C is semi-selforthogonal, then there is an one-to-one correspondence between
equivalent class of n-silting pairs pC, Sq and subcategories Y Ď C Ką0 which is specially covari-
antly ﬁnite in C K"0, suspended and closed under direct sums such that
Y “ C K"0, given by F :
q
pC, Sq ÝÑ SKą0.

Proof. It follows from Proposition 3.2, Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.6 that the correspondence
is well-deﬁned. Indeed, if the two n-silting pairs pC, Sq and pC, T q are equivalent, by Lemma
3.6, we have that SKą0 “ Presn
CKą0 pT q “ T Ką0. Moreover, F is surjective by
Proposition 3.4. If both pC, Sq and pC, T q are n-silting pairs with SKą0 “ T Ką0, it is easy to
verify that pC, S ‘ T q is also n-silting pair by the deﬁnition. So we have that AddS “ AddT
l
by Lemma 3.3, i.e., pC, Sq and pC, T q are equivalent. Hence, F is bijective.

CKą0 pSq “ Presn

In [12], the authors give a bijective correspondence between bounded co-t-structure and a
silting class (i.e., semi-selforthogonal class), see Theorem 5.10. From the Proposition 3.2 (3),
Lemma 3.6 and Corollary 3.5, we can obtain the following result.
It is regrettable that the
co-t-structure in the following result is bounded above.

Theorem 3.8 If C is semi-selforthogonal, then there is a bijection between equivalent class of
silting pairs pC, Sq and bounded above co-t-structure pX , Yq on C K"0 with Y Ď C Ką0 closed
under direct sums.

Proof. This proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.7.
