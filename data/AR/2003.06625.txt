ABSTRACT 

Pressure  significantly  modifies  the  microscopic  interactions  in  condense  phase,  leading  to  new 

patterns  of  bonding  and  unconventional  chemistry.  Both  argon  and  xenon  possess  closed-shell 

electronic  structures,  which  renders  them  chemically  unreactive.  Using  unbiased  structure 

searching  techniques  combined with  first-principles  calculations, we  demonstrate  the  reaction  of 

argon  with  xenon  at  a  pressure  as  low  as  1.1  GPa,  producing  a  novel  van  der  Waals  compound 

XeAr2, which crystallizes in the MgCu2-type Laves phase structure. Due to the pressure-induced 

delocalization of the electrons in outermost shells, the covalent Xe-Xe and Xe-Ar bonds have been 

detected  which  lead  XeAr2  to  be  unexpectedly  stable  without  any  phase  transition  or 

decomposition at least up to 500 GPa.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Due to the stable closed-shell electronic configuration, noble gas (NG) elements (e.g. He, Ne, 

Ar,  Kr  and  Xe)  were  historically  believed  to  be  chemically  unreactive.  However,  Pauling1 

predicted that Xe and Kr may bond to electronegative atoms, which was proved experimentally by 

Bartlett2  with  the  synthesis  of  first  NG  compound  XePtF6.  This  seminal  discovery  leaded  to  a 

recognized renaissance in NG chemistry in the past few decades3-5.     

Under ambient conditions, the heavier NG element Xe, and to some extent, Kr and Ar, have 

been  known  to  be  oxidized  by  halogen  and  oxygen,  forming  halide  and  oxide  compounds6-8. 

Under high pressures, the reactivity of NGs was drastically altered.   

On  one  hand,  application  of  high  pressure  makes  NGs  easier  to  be  oxidized;  for  example, 

NGs  can  be  oxidized  not  only  by  fluorine9-12  and  oxygen13-16,  but  also  nitrogen17  and  sulphur18, 

and even metal elements such as iron and nickel19. Theoretical predictions revealed that Xe reacts 

with S and N at 146 GPa17 and 191 GPa18, respectively. Direct reactions of Xe with Fe/Ni were 

predicted  to  occur  under  the  pressures  of  Earth’s  inner  core19.  A  subsequent  experimental  study 

reported the synthesis of Xe-Ni compound at a pressure round 150 GPa20. Of special attention, the 

Fe/Ni  atoms in  the Xe-Fe/Ni  compounds play  a  role  of anions instead  of  cations that  behave as 

usual metals. In addition, Xe has also been observed to react with water ice at pressures above 50 

GPa21. In these NG compounds, Xe bonds to other elements chemically by sharing its closed shell 

electrons. On the contrary, NG elements can also become oxidants and gain electrons from alkali 

and alkaline earth metals such as Li22, Cs23 and Mg24.   

On the other hand, NGs also form van der Waals  (vdW) compounds under lower pressures 

wherein the NG atoms do not lose or gain electrons. For instance, the Laves phases compounds 

NeHe2

25, ArHe2

26, Ar(H2)2

27, Xe(N2)2

28,29 and Xe(O2)2

30 can be synthesized at pressures of a few 

gigapascals.  The  stabilities  of  such  compounds  can  be  explained  in  terms  of  packing  rules 

analogous  to  binary  crystals  of  hard  spherelike  particles  for  intermetallic  compounds.  Other 

classes of vdW compounds have also been discovered. (N2)6Ne7

31, the structure can be viewed as a 

clathrate  with  the  centers  of  the  N2  molecules  forming  distorted  dodecahedron  cages,  each 

enclosing 14 Ne atoms. XeHe2

32 stabilizes at 12 GPa, adopting a hexagonal AlB2-type structure. 

Some other stoichiometries such as the Xe-H2

33-35, Xe-H2O36 and He-H2O37  38 systems have also 

been observed. The origin of the stability for these compounds was not well understood.   

ACS Omega 2019, 4, 13640−13644. DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b00638 

In  a  few  cases,  unexpected  chemistry  in  Xe-F  compounds  stabilized  by  covalent  Xe-Xe 

bonding9 and in Na2He compound stabilized by long-range Coulomb interactions39 have also been 

reported. It is obvious that the bonding of NGs in compounds under high pressures exhibits strong 

uncertainty, which provides a very broad scenario waiting for further investigation. 

In  this  paper,  we  theoretically  explore  the  phase  diagram  and  bonding  of  Xe-Ar  binary 

system under high pressures. Our results demonstrate the existence of a Xe-Ar compound with the 

stoichiometry  of  XeAr2.  Due  to  the  fact  that  both  of  Ar  and  Xe  have  filled  valence  shells,  this 

compound  is  bound  by  vdW  forces  under  low  pressures.  However,  high  pressures  modified 

substantially  the  atomic  interactions  in  this  compound  and  strong  covalent  bonds  have  been 

detected.   

2. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS 

We  perform  a  systematic  structural  search  for  the  Xe-Ar  binary  system  based  on  a  particle 

swarm  optimization  methodology  as  implemented  in  the  CALYPSO  code40,41,  which  has  been 

successfully employed in predicting a large variety of crystal structures9,17-19,42-44. The underlying 

total energy calculations and structural relaxations are carried out within the framework of density 

functional  theory  using  the  projector-augmented-wave  (PAW)  method45  as  implemented  in  the 

VASP  code46.  We  adopt  the  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh  of  generalized  gradient  approximation47  to 

describe  the  exchange−correlation  functional.  The  electron-ion  interaction  is  described  by 

pseudopotentials with 5s25p6 and 3s23p6 as valence electrons for Xe and Ar, respectively. The use 

of a cutoff energy of 650 eV and dense enough k-point sampling grids give excellent convergence 

of  the  calculated  enthalpy  (<1  meV/atom).  The  dynamical  stability  of  predicted  structures  is 

determined by phonon calculations using the finite displacement approach as implemented in the 

Phonopy code48. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In order to obtain the most energetically favorable structures for the Xe-Ar binary system, the 

stoichiometries of XeArn (n = 1-8) containing up to 4 formula units (f.u.) per simulation cell are 

systematically  searched  under  pressures  of  0,  100,  200  and  500  GPa.  The  calculated  formation 

enthalpies (Hf) of each stoichiometry at different pressures are shown in the form of convex hulls 

as depicted in Figure 1. From this figure, the thermodynamic stability of XeArn can be determined. 

The results indicate that each stoichiometry of XeArn has a small positive Hf at 0 GPa. As pressure 

ACS Omega 2019, 4, 13640−13644. DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b00638 

increase to 100, 200 or 500 GPa, the convex hulls are dominated by a well-developed minimum at 

XeAr2  stoichiometry,  indicating  that  only  XeAr2  is  stable  against  decomposition  in  to  elemental 

Xe  and  Ar.  The  other  stoichiometries  are  thermodynamically  unstable  due  to  the  fact  that  the 

increase of pressure would promote their formation enthalpies to be more positive. 

The  stable  XeAr2  compound  is  predicted  to  crystallize  in  the  MgCu2-type  Lave  phase 

structure  (Figure  2a),  wherein  the  Xe  atoms  occupy  the  Mg  (8a)  sites,  forming  a  diamond-type 

sublattice, and the Ar atoms reside in the voids of the Xe framework, occupying the Cu (16d) sites. 

By  representing  its  constituents  as  hard  spheres,  the  stability  of  AB2-type  Lave  phase  can  be 

understand by  packing  rule,  i.e.,  a  hard-sphere  radius  ratio  RA/RB  close  to  1.25  will  achieve  the 

maximum packing efficiency (0.71%) when crystalize in Lave phase49. The ratio RA/RB of XeAr2 

is 1.13, which is close to the ideal value of a Laves phase. Our structural search simulations reveal 

that  the  increase  of  pressure  will  further  stabilize  the  Laves  phase  XeAr2,  instead  of  any  phase 

transition  or  decomposition,  which  is  in  sharp  distinction  with  other  NG  compounds  such  as 

XeHe2

32, NeHe2 26 and ArHe2

26. 

The  inset  of  Figure  1  shows  the  pressure-dependent  formation  enthalpy  of  MgCu2-type 

XeAr2 wherein it is shown that XeAr2 becomes stable at 1.1 GPa. The effect of vdW interactions 

on  the stability  of  XeAr2  is  also calculated by  using  the  PBE-D2  method50.  The results indicate 

that the stable pressure shift to 2.6 GPa with the inclusion of vdW corrections. To determine the 

dynamical stability of MgCu2-type XeAr2, the phonon dispersion spectra are calculated based on 

the quasi-harmonic model, and the selected results are shown in Figure 3. It is found that XeAr2 is 

dynamically stable without showing any imaginary phonon frequency in the pressure range from 5 

GPa to 500 GPa. 

It is known that the Gibbs free energy (G = H - TS) reduces to enthalpy (H = U + pV) when 

temperature is 0 K. The formation enthalpy of a compound is determined by the relative internal 

energy ∆U and p∆V term with respect to elemental solids. The calculated pressure dependence of 

∆U and p∆V of XeAr2 are shown in Figure 4. It is obvious that the p∆V term has negative values 

over  the  pressure  range  considered.  The  large  gain  in  p∆V  term  effectively  tunes  the  formation 

enthalpy  to  be  negative  though  the  relative  internal  energies  ∆U  are  positive  at  0~150  GPa, 

leading to the reaction of Xe with Ar above 1.1 GPa. The negative p∆V of XeAr2 is attributed to 

the smaller volume compared to the mixing volume of elemental Xe and Ar. For comparison, we 

ACS Omega 2019, 4, 13640−13644. DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b00638 

also  calculated  the  pressure  dependent  p∆V  for  MgCu2-type  XeS2

18  and  AlB2-type  XeHe2

32.  As 

shown in Figure 4, the p ~ p∆V curve of XeS2 is similar to that of XeAr2, being negative in the 

whole pressure region considered. While the results of XeHe2 is negative under low pressures but 

becomes to be positive under high pressures. In other worlds, the pressure induced close-packed 

MgCu2-type  XeS2 and  XeAr2 make  themselves  energetically  more  favorable  than  the  elemental 

solids  in  the  whole  pressure  region  considered,  whereas  the  AlB2-type  XeHe2  which  adopts  a 

layered structure would stabilizes at low pressures but decompose at high pressures32. 

To get further insight into the stabilized mechanism, we calculated the electronic properties 

and atomic interactions of XeAr2 under high pressures. 

Figure 5 shows the calculated projected density of states (PDOS) at different pressures. It is 

clear that XeAr2 is a wide-gap insulator under low pressures. At 10 GPa, the band gap is 8.0 eV 

(Figure  5a).  The  Ar  3s and Xe 5s electrons occupy  the  lowest  states  of  valence band  located  at 

-17.5  eV  and  -12.5  eV,  respectively.  The  states  range  from  -5.5  eV  to  0  eV  are  predominantly 

composed of Ar 3p and Xe 5p components mixed with a small contribution from Ar 3p and Xe 5p. 

All of these states are highly localized, which suggest a weak interaction between Xe and Ar. As 

pressure increases, the band gap decreases slowly, and the metallization occurs at about 500 GPa 

(Figure  2b).  Under  high  pressure,  as  can  be  seen  from  the  PDOS  plotted  in  Figure  5b,  the 

electronic  states  are  wildly  broadened,  indicating  the  relevant  valence  electrons  become  more 

delocalized. Moreover, the PDOS shows a significant overlap between the 5p states of Xe and the 

3p states of Ar. Visible overlaps also exit between other states, such as the Ar 3s and Xe 5p, and 

the Xe 5s and Ar 3p states. Additionally, Bader analysis51 reveals a charge transfer of 0.43 e/atom 

from  Xe  to  Ar  at  500  GPa  (Figure  2C).  These  features  of  electronic  properties  indicate  strong 

chemical interactions in the XeAr2 compound.   

Given the fact that NG atoms have filled valence shells, two NG atoms always do not engage 

in  chemical  bonding.  However,  the  pressure  induced  formation  of  Xe−Xe  covalent  bond  is 

predicted  in  a  Xe2F  compound,  which  is  the  first  example  of  NG-NG  bond.  For  XeAr2  that 

composed  by  two  NG  elements,  the  nearest  Xe-Xe,  Xe-Ar  and  Ar-Ar  distances  at  500  GPa  are 

2.56 Å, 2.45 Å and 2.09 Å, respectively. These atomic distances are close enough for them to form 

covalent  bonds  compared  with  the  proposed  covalent  radius  of  Xe  (1.40  Å)  and  Ar  (1.06  Å) 

atoms52.  To  detect  the  covalent  bonding  in  XeAr2,  we  calculate  the  Crystalline  Orbital 

ACS Omega 2019, 4, 13640−13644. DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.9b00638 

Hamiltonian Population (COHP) for nearest-neighboring Xe-Xe, Xe-Ar and Ar-Ar pairs. As can 

be  seen  form  Figure  5c,  the  contributions  from  bonding  states  are  larger  than  that  from 

antibonding in the occupied states of Xe-Xe pair. As a result, the integrated COHP (ICOHP) up to 

the  Fermi  level  is  -1.20  eV/pair  for  bonded  Xe-Xe,  indicating  a  strong  covalent  bonding. 

Furthermore,  we  also  calculate  the  electron  localization  function  (ELF)53  of  XeAr2  at  500  GPa 

(Figure 2d). The observed large ELF basins (~0.5) confirm the presence of covalent Xe-Xe bonds. 

The COHP plots of Xe-Ar and Ar-Ar pairs show that the visible overlaps of the Ar 3s, Ar 3p, Xe 

5s and Xe 5p states range from -35 to -15 eV are also related to the covalent bonding. However, 

because of the large occupation of the antibonding states, the ICOHP of Xe-Ar is -0.36, indicating 

a  weaker  covalent  bonding.  The  obtained  smaller  ELF  values  (0.32)  between  the  neighboring 

Xe-Ar atoms and the ELF distributions of Ar atoms depart from sphericity also confirm this. The 

bonding of neighboring Ar-Ar atoms is much weaker since the ICOHP is only -0.07.   

4. CONCLUSIONS 

In  summary,  we  have  theoretically  explored  the  stability  of  XeArn  (n  =  1-8)  under  high 

pressures up to 500 GPa using the effective CALYPSO structure searching method combined with 

first-principles calculations. The results shown that Xe reacts with Ar at a pressure as low as 1.1 

GPa,  producing  a  MgCu2-type  Lave  phase  XeAr2  compound.  This  compound  is  a  wide-gap 

insulator  which  would  metallizes  at  about  500  GPa.  Analysis  of  the  electronic  structures  and 

atomic interactions indicates the vdW XeAr2 compound under low pressures would change to an 

extended solid wherein atoms are bonded by network of covalent bonds under high pressures. Our 

results shed light on the chemical bonding between NG elements and enrich NG chemistry.
