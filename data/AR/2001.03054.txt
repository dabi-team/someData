We present the results on excimer laser modification and patterning of amorphous vanadium pentoxide films. Wet  positive resist-type 
and Ar ion-beam negative resist-type etching techniques were employed to develop UV-modified films. V2O5 films were found to pos-
sess  sufficient  resistivity  compared  to  standard  electronic  materials  thus  to  be  promising  masks  for  sub-micron  lithography
. 

1 Introduction  Nowadays  advances  in  synthesis  and 
characterization  of  transition  metal  oxide  semiconductors 
enable appearance of a new  field of  oxide electronics [1]. 
Vanadium  pentoxide  is  one  of  these  promising  materials 
for  microelectronic,  electrochemical  and  optoelectronic 
devices  [2-8].  Some  promising  applications  of  V2O5  have 
been  discussed  in  our  previous  paper  [9].    Furthermore, 
vanadium  pentoxide  can  be  reduced  to  lower  oxides  [2], 
such  as,  e.g.,  VO2,  and  vanadium  dioxide  has  various  po-
tential applications in electronics due to the metal-insulator 
transition [10]. As was noted in [9], development of lithog-
raphy methods for V2O5 remains a topical problem, and in 
this paper we evolve and extend the results obtained there.  
In principle, inorganic resists should have higher limit-
ing  resolution  than  polymer  resists  due  to  smaller  funda-
mental  structural  units  and  stronger  bonds  in  the  former.  
[11,  12].  However,  compositional  and/or  structural  inho-
mogeneities  may  limit  their  ultimate  resolution,  while  or-
ganic  hybrid  resists  with  incorporated  inorganic  particles 
can result in sub-100 nm resolution [13]. Other merit of in-
organic resists is their high plasma-stability as compared to 
an organic resist.  

Regarding the activation mechanisms, inorganic resists 
can  be  generally  categorized  into  two  groups:  inorganic 
photo-  and  thermoresists.  AgI,  chalcogenides  GeSey  and 
As2S3 present the group of inorganic photoresists. With the 
addition  of  silver,  Ag-chalcogenide  inorganic  resists  (e.g. 
Ag2Te/As2S3  and  Ag2Se/GeSe2)  possess  very  high  expo-
sure sensitivity: 3 – 10 mJ/cm2 at 248 nm [14]. Instead of 
being photochemically sensitive to light, inorganic thermo-
resists  are  activated  by  heat  from  a  light,  by  electrons      
(e-beam), ions (ion-beam) or X-ray absorbed by the resist 
film.  Since  the  conversion  process  requires  simply  a  tem-
perature  change,  thermoresists  appear  to  be  more  wave-
length  invariant  than  organic  or  inorganic  photoresists. 

Group  of  inorganic  thermoresists  is  presented  by  Fe/O, 
Al/O, and bimetallic resists as Bi/In and  Sn/In. 

A resist made of a material, which can be used for fab-
rication  of  opto-electronic  devices,  is  of  special  interest 
[15-17]. One of such materials is just the amorphous V2O5  
studied in this work.  

Due  to  the  unfilled  d-shells,  transition  metals  exhibit 
multiple  oxidation  states  and  form,  as  a  rule,  a  number  of 
oxides  which  can  undergo  various  structural  and  phase 
transformations under the influence of different external ac-
tions,  such  as  heat  treatment,  electron  and  ion  bombard-
ment, laser radiation, etc.  Amorphous vanadium pentoxide 
has  also  been  reported  to  undergo  such  transformations 
known  as  thermo-  [5]  photo-    [4,  5,  20-22],    and  electro-
chromism  [23,  24],  electron-  and  ion-beam-induced  modi-
fication  [18,  19],  and  AFM  patterning  [25].  Recently,  we 
have  shown  the  possibility  to  perform  laser  UV  (405  nm 
wavelength) micro-patterning of amorphous vanadium pen-
toxide  films      [9],  100  nm-scale  resolution  patterning  of 
amorphous  V2O5  and  VO2,  prepared  by  anodic  oxidation, 
using  laser  and  e-beam  modification  [26],  and  memory 
switching  with  the  N-type  negative  differential  resistance,

tures [27].

  Amorphous V2O5 films obtained by anodic oxidation 
are  the  most  sensitive  to  the  external  perturbations  [26], 
but the main drawback of the anodic films is the residuary 
metallic  sublayer.  Therefore,  amorphous  V2O5  films  ob-
tained by vacuum deposition seem to be  more perspective 
for 
the  processes  of  selective  etching,  micro-  and 
nanostructure  fabrication  [9].  In  addition,  high  plasma  re-
sistivity of oxides allows usage of V2O5 as an inorganic re-
sistive mask for plasma etching.

Most  previous  researches  were  focused  on  electro-
chromic and photochromic coloration of vanadium pentox-
ide [4, 5, 20-24], in which transparent amorphous or crys-
talline thin films can be colored reversibly to a blue state. 
This  effect  is  usually  described  in  terms  of  the  double-
charge injection model. In the photochromism, water is de-
composed into H and highly reactive O atoms upon irradia-
tion of UV light and HxV2O5 forms. (если эти рассужде-
ния  нужны,  то  можно  оставить  как  есть  –  пусть  не-
большой  повтор  из  9  останется  –  ничего  страшного) 
Present or adsorbed water plays an important role. The en-
hancement  of  photochromism  in  V2O5  thin  films  by  ad-
sorption of dimethylformamide (DMFA) molecules on the 
oxide  film surface  was reported in [28]. Short (20 ns) ex-
cimer laser pulses create vacant oxygen sites thus result in 
thermochromic modification of V2O5 surface [20].   

Unlike  our  previous  work  [9],  where  the  modification 
under the action of the low power (~20mW/cm2) UV radi-
ation has been studied, in this work we study the effect of 
the  intence  UV  excimer laser irradiation, which has a dif-
ferent physical nature of the influence. The powerful radia-
tion is supposed to produce stronger structure modification 
all  over  the  film  thickness,  higher  selectivity  of  chemical 
etching and the surface morphology change. In addition, in 
this  paper  we  present  the  results  of  ion  beam  etching  and 
the etching rate measurements. 

2 Experimental 
V2O5 films of 100 to 300 nm thick  were fabricated by 
pulsed  laser  deposition  (PLD)  from  stoichiometric  V2O5 
target at room temperature onto glass, Si and SiO2/Si sub-
strates, as described in [9].  KrF (=248 nm) excimer laser 
(Lambda Physik 300) was used with a pulse duration of 20 
ns.  The  vacuum  system  ensured  the  residual  gas  pressure 
lower than 10-6 Torr. The laser radiation energy and pulse 
repetition frequency were 200 mJ and 10 Hz, respectively. 
Laser energy density on the surface of the V2O5 target was 
approximately 2-4 J·cm-2. The distance between the target 
and substrate  was 95 mm, and the oxygen partial pressure 
during the deposition was 70 mTorr. 

All the films prepared at room temperature have a good 

adhesion and withstand standard test with a scotch tape. 

UV-laser modification was performed by KrF excimer 
laser  (COMPEX-102),  λ  =  248  nm,  by  two  pulses  (20  ns 
duration) with a total dose of 150 mJ·cm-2. Laser spot size 
was  about  200  mm2.  Exposure  was  performed  through  a 
special network mask with a step of 11 m (Fig. 1).  

Ion-beam  etching  (IBE)  was  employed  using  a  stand-
ard  Kaufman  type  ion  source  (Veeco  Microetch)  with  ar-
gon pressure in the discharge and sample chambers of 10-4 
and  2·10-6  Torr,  respectively.  Etching  depth  and  films 
thicknesses were measured by a profilometer (Tencor P10). 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force 
microscopy  (AFM)  images  were  obtained  using  Zeiss 
DSM-942 and SMM-2000 microscopes, respectively. 

3. Results  and discussion  AFM and SEM studies 
showed that the as-fabricated V2O5 films were homogene-
ous  without  pin-holes  and  foreign  inclusions.  The  surface 
roughness before UV modification was ~ 3 nm (Fig.1, a, b), 
which  was  more  than  six  times  lower  than  that  for  the 
modified  oxide  (~  20  nm).    X-ray  structural  analysis 
showed  that  the  before  and  after  UV  modification  V2O5 
films  were  amorphous  –  their  X-ray  2scansdid  not 
contain  any  diffraction  peaks.  The  bandgap  of  2.3  eV 
measured from the optical absorption edge corresponds to 
vanadium pentoxide [9].

Recently [30], we have shown that UV laser modifica-
tion  of  an  initial  vanadium  pentoxide  film  lead  to  a  de-
crease of the short order range sizes from 2.4 nm to 1.2 nm.

films is a strongly distorted oxygen octahedron. The char-
acter of tetragonal pyramid distortions in initial and modi-
fied  films  is  different,  and  it  also  differs  from  the  V2O5 
crystalline  phase.  Also,  the  small  part  of  pyramids  in  the 
studied  films  of  amorphous  vanadium  pentoxide  is  not 
completed (there is no one of tops).  

Development of the  modified films  was accomplished 
in  the  formic  acid-acetone-formalin  (15:10:1)  solution. 
This process is similar to the development of a positive re-
sist, the virgin-to-modified selectivity of etching was found 
to  be  ~10.  Figure  1  demonstrates  the  SEM  image  of  the 
surface  of  V2O5 film  subjected  to  2  pulses  of  248  nm  ex-
cimer  laser  with  the  total  dose  of  150  mJ·cm-2 and  selec-
tively etched in the formic acid-acetone-formalin solution.  
Amorphous V2O5 resist can be easily removed in, e.g., 
1% aqueous HCl, and crystallized V2O5 resist – in the solu-
tion NaOH-H2O2-H2O (1:1:100); note that similar compo-
sitions  are  usually  used  for  developing  of  standard  photo-
resists without damage of Si substrates. 

fied-to-virgin  selectivity  of  V2O5  films  etching  was  found 
to  be  2.5−3.0  (see  Fig.2,  b).  The  selectivity  achieved  in 
IBE developing of vanadium pentoxide resist appears to be 
lower than that for the wet etching, but in some cases it can 
be used with sufficient efficiency. 

Table 1 demonstrates the rates of Ar-IBE for exposed, 
initial V2O5 (authors data) and some other materials [31] at 
ion-beam power density w = 0.5 W/cm2, vertical incidence 
of  ions  with  energy  450  eV,  and  residual  pressure  in  a 
chamber less than 10-4 Pa.  

It  becomes  evident  that  the  rate  of  etching  for  the  ex-
posed V2O5 oxide is 3 - 4 times lower than that for most of 
the materials applied in microelectronic industry. Especial-
ly  high  selectivity  appears  in  comparison  with  such  semi-
conductors as GaAs, InAs, and InSb widely applied in op-
toelectronic devices [32].

Also,  one  can  see  from  Table  1  that  V2O5  possesses 
higher  resistivity to  ion-beam  etching  (6-7 times)  as com-
pared to PMMA. 

4. Conclusions 
In  summary,  we  demonstrate  the  possibility  to  use 
V2O5 films as UV resist. Modification of amorphous layers 
of  V2O5  was  made  by  248  nm  excimer  laser  source.  Two 
methods of development of UV modified V2O5 films were 
employed: positive resist-type wet etching in the formic ac-
id-acetone-formalin  solution  and  negative  resist-type  Ar 
ion-beam etching. Sufficient resistivity of amorphous V2O5 
films  compared  to  standard  electronic  materials  makes 
them perspective for sub-micron fabrication.
