Acknowledgements

First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Gold, he has been really kind and patient to

me. In the early year of my graduate school, I am struggling with accommodating dif-

ferent culture and environment which took my focus away from the school. However,

Prof. Gold never gave upon me, and gave me a lot of space to work on my issues.

Throughout the time in my graduate school, he always be there for me and gives me

freedom to do whatever I want to do but in the same time gives the guidance on my

research topic. I am grateful to have him as my advisor. Franco, who is the postdoc

at the time also provide me a lot of advise on experimental skills. I learned a lot from

him and have a really good time to work with him. I also want to thank miles who

is the undergraduate student at the time, he poses a excellent skill on experimental

stuﬀ, and help me to build up many tests. During the writing of this manuscript,

Guy helps me to correct and polish my english, I am also appreciated for his help.

I also would like to thanks my friends in MiniCLEAN collaboration. When I

station at SNOLab, Kimberly Palladino, Steve Linden and Thomas Caldwell taught

me many skills on operation in underground lab. Kim is the on-site manager at the

time and she organize everything well, Steve who became on-site manager after Kim’s

departure also done a good job on operation of detector. I learned from them and

also received lots advise from them. Tom taught me lots things of data analysis,

which enable me to do the data analysis in the later time. Chris Benson share his

experiences on the subsystem of MiniCLEAN, allows me to relate the data to the

hardware even I was not on site. Chris Jackson help me on doing simulation and he

also organize the analysis tasks well such that I just need to follow his plan. Josh

takes over the spokesperson when MiniCLEAN collaboration in its darkest time, save

the project and allows me to have a chance to ﬁnish my thesis. I am grateful for all

they have done for the collaboration and myself.

My friends in Albuquerque also helps me to go through some down time in my

graduate school. Chih-feng and hung hung out with me from time to time to relief

my stress in the period of time when I am not sure if I can keep going with my

research. My friends in Taiwan also constantly encourage me, gave me energy to keep

moving toward the goal. One of my best friends G.Y. Chen who now is the associate

professor in prestigious university in Taiwan always listen to my complain and push

me to pursue my dream. Finally, I would like to thanks my parents, they never told

me what to do, just always supported me unconditionally. I could not have done this

without their supports. They are the best parents to me in this world.

ABSTRACT

Particle Dark Matter is a hypothesis accounting for a number of observed as-

trophysical phenomena such as the anomalous galactic rotation curves. From these

astronomical observation, about 23 % of the Universe is made by dark matter. Among

the possible candidates of dark matter, Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMPs)

seems to be most promising candidates. The hypothetical particle provides a mech-

anism of producing the dark matter and is in consistent with the results inferred by

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), reproduce the correct relic density of dark

matter.

In particle physics, understanding dark matter may leads to new physics

beyond standard model.

The MiniCLEAN dark matter experiment will exploit a single-phase liquid-argon

detector instrumented with 92 photomultiplier tubes placed in the cryogen temper-

ature with 4-π coverage of a 500 kg (150 kg) target (ﬁducial) mass. The detector

design strategy emphasizes scalability to target masses of order 10 tons or more.

The detector is designed also for a liquid neon target that allows for an independent

veriﬁcation of signal and background and a test of the expected dependence of the

WIMP-nucleus interaction rate.

For MiniCLEAN, PMT stability and calibration are essential. The In-situ optical

calibration will be able monitor the PMT stability and maintain the calibration.

In MiniCLEAN, we use a Light-Emitting Diode(LED)- based light injection system

to provide single photons for calibration, the calibration can be performed in near

vi

real-time, providing a continuous monitor at the condition of the detector. The

intrinsic 39Ar beta emitter provides another way to calibrate the detector thanks to

well deﬁned properties and uniformly distributed inside the detector volume. The

energy scale can be determined by ﬁtting the energy spectrum of experimental 39Ar

data. Moreover, the preliminary results from cold gas run shows the best measurement

on triplet lifetime (∼ 3.5 µ s). The results conﬁrms the high purity of argon is

attained by MiniCLEAN’s puriﬁcation system. The long triplet lifetime in gaseous

argon can be exploit to obtain better performance of pulse shape discrimination (PSD)

for future dark matter detector, also the low density of gaseous argon reduced the

multi-scattering neutron backgrounds. On the other hand, by injecting 39Ar spike,

the electronic recoil events due to 39Ar beta decay can be used to test the limit of PSD

in liquid argon. The results will be informative for future multi-tonne LAr detector.

Introduction and Detection of Dark

Matter

1.1 Overview

Dark Matter is a long standing mystery of our universe. The energy of our universe

today is a fossil of the progresses that took place as its early stages. About 5% of our

universe consists of visible matter , while 23% consists of dark matter(DM). The relic

abundance of either of these components requires physics beyond what has currently

been established.

The standard model of particle physics gives an excellent description of physical

processes at energies thus far probed by experiments. Unitarity of electroweak interac-

tion, however, breaks down at energy scales (cid:46) O(Tev) in the absence of a mechanism

to account for electroweak-symmetry breaking. This imply that a new framework

will be required at reduced Plank scale Mp = (8πGN ewton)−1/2 = 2.4 × 1018 GeV,

where the quantum gravitational eﬀect becomes important. Moreover, the fact that

Mp/MW is so huge which gives a strong indication that must be new physics beyond

the Standard Model, and also because of the infamous "hierarchy problem".[1] Su-

persymmetry theory provides a diﬀerent approach to help physicist to resolve the

problem. it can render a theory stable to the radiative corrections which would oth-

erwise force a ﬁne tuning of high-energy parameters. In the following sections, the

evidences from astrophysical observation are present. The possible candidates of dark

matter will also be discussed. Finally, the eﬀorts to dark matter direct detection will

be described by the end of this chapter.

1.2 Astronomical Evidence of Dark Matter

1.2.1 Coma Cluster

The discrepancy between the mass and the light produced by astronomical objects

was found by Fritz Zwicky[2]. Zwicky studied the coma cluster which is about 99 Mpc

from Earth, and observing doppler shifts in galactic spectra. With the observation,

the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma cluster can be computed. Zwicky then

used the virial theorem to calculate the cluster’s mass.

(cid:104)T (cid:105) = −

1
2

(cid:104)U (cid:105),

(1.1)

where (cid:104)T (cid:105) is average kinetic energy which can be obtained from the velocity disper-

sion, and (cid:104)U (cid:105) is average potential energy. Once the (cid:104)T (cid:105) is found, using virial theorem

can calculate the total mass of the whole system. It was found by Zwicky that the

total mass of the cluster was Mc (cid:39) 4.5 × 1013M(cid:12). However, the mass of the cluster

estimated from the standard M/L ratios just approximately 2% of this value. There-

fore the results from Zwicky imply that there are huge masses in the cluster which is

“missing” for some reason or “non-luminous”. Although Zwicky was not able to give

a full explanation of the problem, his results inspired many researchers to continue

probing the problem.

1.2.2 Rotation Curve

Observing the luminous object in the galaxy can gives a ﬁrst order of estimation of

the mass of the galaxy. Some interstellar gas, however, also contribute to the mass

distribution of the galaxy. It was found that these gases also emit the electromagnetic

wave and can be detected by the radio telescope. Most of the interstellar gas has

hydrogen atom which ﬁrst studied by van de Hulst et al.[3]. The hydrogen emits

radio waves in 21 cm, which can be used to detect the interstellar gas and measure

the velocity. From Newton’s gravitational law, if the galaxy has mass m(r) within

the radius r, then the velocity as a function of radius r should be :

(cid:114)

v(r) =

G ·

m(r)
r

,

(1.2)

where G is the gravitational constant. This imply the velocity should decreased when

the radius increased i.e. v(r) ∝ 1/

√

r. This is generally referred to as “Keplerian”

behavior. However, the experimental results on the rotation curve of spiral galaxy

deviates the “Keplerian” behavior as shown in Fig. 1.1. The ﬂat rotation curve was

found in many galaxies indicating some huge mass is unaccounted for at large radius.

With the technique to detector the velocity of interstellar gas, the contribution from

dark matter can be estimated using the rotation curve as shown in Fig. 1.2. The

“dark matter halo” envelope the galactic disc and give rises the local matter density.

The experimental data of rotation curve shows the clear proof of existence of dark

matter.

1.2.3 CMB

Cosmic microwave background is the electromagnetic radiation from early universe.

The photons scattering oﬀ last scattering surface (LSS) and redshifted due to the

expansion of universe were observed in CMB. There are many cosmological parameters

can be determined or constraint by CMB observations. The comprehensive review

of CMB theory can be found in [6]. It is ﬁrst discovered by Penzias and Wilson[7]

in 1964 and the ﬁrst map of CMB of universe is made by the Diﬀerential Microwave

Radiometer (DMR) aboard NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)[8]. The

ﬁrst result from COBE has 7 degree of angular resolution, gives the snap shot of

universe about 380,000 years after the big bang which is approximately 14 billion

years ago from now. After years eﬀort, the image released by Wilkinson Microwave

Anisotropy (WMAP) with fraction-of-a-degree resolution as shown in FIg. 1.3 shows

that the temperature ﬂuctuations of no more than 10−5 and the spectrum follow

precisely of a black body radiation with temperature T = 2.726 K.

The ﬂuctuations of temperature observed by experiments can be expressed as

(1.4)

Assuming the temperature ﬂuctuation is Gaussian, the power spectrum of CMB con-

tains all the information. Figure 1.4 shows the power spectrum from WMAP’s data.

The abundance of baryon (Ωbh2) and matter (Ωmh2) in the universe can be calcu-

lated using the information extracted from CMB data and with ﬁxed 6 parameters

in cosmological model[9].

Ωbh2 = 0.02264 ± 0.00050 Ωmh2 = 0.01364 ± 0.00440,

Various experiments[10, 11] dedicated to measure the power spectrum of CMB, and

astronomical measurements of the power spectrum from large scale structure[12],

gives the constraint of the abundance of baryon density in the universe :

0.018 < Ωbh2 < 0.023

(1.6)

which is in consistent with the predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis[13]. These

astronomical evidences all point to a large and opaque massive object in our universe

which is another strong evidence of dark matter.

1.2.4 Dark Matter Candidates

The solid proof of existence of dark matter has been established in the previous

sections. From the cosmological constraint, the dark matter should be non-baryonic.

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

7

Therefore, the candidates of dark matter should satisfy several requirements.

• Dark matter should have no or extremely weak interactions with photons, such

that it is “dark”.

• Self-interactions of dark matter should be small. If the interaction is not small,

the dark matter halo should shrinks with time past due to the self-interactions.

The observation of Bullet Cluster provides a astronomical evidence(see Fig.

1.5). The Bullet cluster was created by merger of two galaxy cluster. When

the two cluster collides with each other, the two dark matter halos (Blue bulk

in Fig. 1.5) passed through. However, the baryonic gas (Red bulk in Fig. 1.5)

has shocked and is located between two halos.

• The interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter should also be weak.

If not, the baryon-dark matter disk would be form which is in contradiction with

the observed diﬀuse and extended dark matter halos.

• Dark matter can not be made up of Standard Model (SM) particles. The only

suitable particles in SM is neutrino. However, a simple calculation shows the

neutrinos can not responsible for all the dark matter in the universe. The relic

density of neutrino is given by

Ωνh2 =

3
(cid:88)

i=1

mi
93 eV

(1.7)

where mi is the mass of i-th neutrino. The current upper limit on sum of

neutrino mass from cosmological observation is mν < 0.13 eV[14] with 95%

C.L. . This gives the upper bound on the total relic density of neutrino is

Ωνh2 (cid:46) 0.0014

(1.8)

This means the neutrinos are simply not abundant enough to be responsible

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

8

for all the dark matter in the universe. However, even if neutrino has much

larger mass , they still can not responsible for the whole dark matter if they

are traveling relativistically. They can free-stream and wash out the ﬂuctuation

which creates the large scale structure[15]. In the neutrino dominated universe,

the galaxies only can form at the time z < 2[16], which is in contrast to what

has been observed.

Some of the candidates which meet the requirement of above properties is summarized

here.

• Axions : Axions were introduced to attempt to solve the CP violation problem.

The mass of axions are extremely small ((cid:46) 0.01 eV) which inferred from stellar

cooling and the dynamics of supernova 1987A. Moreover, they have extremely

weak interactions with ordinary matter which implies that they were not in

thermal equilibrium in the early universe. The relic density of axions depends on

the assumptions of the production mechanism, thus is uncertain. However, an

acceptable range could be found for axions to satisfy all present day constraints,

thus become a possible candidates of dark matter[17].

• Sterile neutrinos : The hypothetical particles ﬁrst proposed as a dark matter

candidates in 1993 by Dodelson and Widrow[18]. They are similar to the SM

neutrino but without weak interactions. The results from WMAP reionization

optical depth implies the massive stars were form prior to redshift z > 20 while

the dark matter structures were in place. Thus, it is not possible for dark matter

particle mass is smaller than ∼ 10 keV[19]. The sterile neutrino provides a

alternative explanation for the WMAP optical depth is reionization by decaying

sterile neutrinos[20].

• Standard Model neutrino : The neutrinos in SM could also be a dark matter

candidates but as mentioned previously, they can not responsible for all the

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

9

dark matter in the universe.

• Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) : They are most promising can-

didates to explain the dark matter. They were introduced by new physics at

electroweak scale (i.e. supersymmetry ) as a new stable, weakly-interacting par-

ticles, with mass of order Mχ ∼100 GeV. In supersymmetric theory (SUSY),

the WIMP is the neutralino

˜χ = ξγ ˜γ + ξZ

˜Z 0 + ξh1

˜h0
1 + ξh2

˜h0
2,

(1.9)

is a linear combination of the SUSY partners of the photon, Z 0 boson, and

neutral Higgs bosons. WIMPs are stable and particle theory models suggest

masses Mχ ∼ 10 -103 GeV.

The WIMPs are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at temperature T (cid:38) Mχ in the

early universe. Using Boltzmann equation, the WIMP number density as a function

of time t is :

dnχ
dt

= −3Hnχ − (cid:104)σann · v(cid:105)(n2

eq).

(1.10)

where neq is the desity of equilibrium, the Hubble constant in the early universe is

H 2 = ρrad/3M 2

p , and (cid:104)σann · v(cid:105) is the e thermally averaged WIMP annihilation cross

section times WIMP relative velocity. At the temperature cooled to Tf r – the freeze-

out point, the annihilation rate of WIMPs overtaken by the expansion rate. Thus the

WIMPs freeze-out and the number density in a co-moving volume becomes constant.

Therefore, the present-day WIMP relic density can be approximated as :

an annihilation cross section of weak strength of order ∼ 10−36 cm2 and WIMP

freeze-out velocity give a correct present day relic density of dark matter, so-called

“WIMP-miracle” (see Fig. 1.6). Therefore, most of direct search for dark matter

experiments assumes the dark halo is made of WIMPs.

In the following sections,

WIMPs are considered as only candidates of dark matter.

1.3 Direct Dark Matter Detection

Assuming WIMPs make up the halo of the Milky Way, they will have a local spa-

tial density nχ ∼ 0.004 (Mχ/100GeV)−1cm−3. The velocity of WIMPs follows the

Maxwellian velocity distribution with most probable velocities v ∼ 200 km sec−1[23].

WIMPs can interact with itself or baryonic matter with very small cross-section.

The cross section between annihilation χχ → q ¯q and the elastic scattering χq → χq

process are more or less the same (Fig. 1.7 ∼ 10−36 cm2). Therefore, indirectly obser-

vation can be made through detecting the product of annihilation (γ rays, electrons,

positrons) or directly observation through the interaction of WIMPs-target nucleus

in low-background detector. MiniCLEAN is designed base on direct detection, thus

I will focus on the technique required to directly detect WIMPs and compare the

results between diﬀerent experiments in the following sections.

1.3.1 Basic Principle

Due to extremely small cross-section between WIMPs and ordinary matter, when

WIMPs incident on target atom, small energy will be deposited (1-100 keV). Moreover,

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

12

the multiple scattering between WIMPs and target atom can be negligible for the

same reason. A nuclear recoil is expected for interaction between WIMPs and target

atom[24]. The diﬀerential spectrum of dark matter interactions can be expressed as

[25] :

dR
dE

(E, t) =

ρ0
mχ · mA

(cid:90)

·

v · f (v, t) ·

dσ
dE

(E, v)d3v,

(1.13)

where dσ

dE (E, v) is the diﬀerential cross-section of WIMPs and nucleus interaction and

mχ is the mass of dark matter. The WIMP cross-section σ and mχ can be measured

experimentally. The velocity of dark matter is deﬁned as the velocity in the rest frame

of the detector and mA is the nucleus mass. The local dark matter density ρ0 and

velocity distribution f (v, t) are the astrophysical parameters. Moreover, the velocity

distribution will change with time due to the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.

In general, the energy produced by WIMPs-nucleus recoil is easier to be determined

than the directional information. The Eq. 1.13 can be approximated by

dR

(1.14)

where (cid:0) dR

dE

(cid:1)
0 is the event rate at zero momentum transfer and Ec is a constant param-

eterizing a characteristic energy scale which depends on the dark matter mass and

target nucleus[25]. F 2(E) is the nuclear form factor which accounts for when the par-

ticle wavelength is not large compare to the nuclear radius, the cross-section decreases

with increasing momentum transfer: σ ∝ σ0 · F 2, where σ0 is the zero-momentum

transfer cross-section. Therefore, at low recoil energy, the signal is dominated by

exponential function.

Another signature of dark matter signal is “annual modulation”. Due to relative

motion between Earth and dark matter halo in the Milky Way, the velocity of dark

matter particle reaches maximum around June 2 and has minimum in December.

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

13

This results in the events that produced by WIMP-nucleus recoil exceed detector’s

threshold also have maximum in June[26]. For experiment which can observe multiple

events in a year, the amplitude of the variation in event rates at diﬀerent time of a

year can be observed. The diﬀerential event rate for the modulation can be written

as [27]

dR
dE

(E, t) ≈ S0(E) + Sm(E) · cos

(cid:18) 2π(t − t0)
T

(cid:19)

,

(1.15)

where T is the period of one year and t0 is the phase which is expected at about 150

days. The modulation amplitude is given by Sm while the time averaged events rate

is S0. The signature signal from modulation can help to discriminate the back ground

signal and conﬁrm the dark matter detection as well.

Additionally, the directionality is another desired capability of the detector for

dark matter detection. As indicated in [28], the direction of WIMP-nucleus recoil

has a strong angular dependance. The angle θ can be deﬁned as the direction of the

nuclear recoil relative to the mean direction of the solar motion, thus the diﬀerential

rate equation gives :

dR
dE d cos θ

∝ exp

(cid:20)−[(vE + v(cid:12)) cos θ − vmin]2
v2
c

(cid:21)

.

(1.16)

where vE is the Earth’s motion, v(cid:12) is the velocity of the Sun around the galactic

centre, vmin represents the minimum WIMP velocity that can produce a WIMP-

nucleus recoil of energy E and vc is the circular velocity of the dark matter halo
(vc = (cid:112)3/2v(cid:12)). The integrated rate from Eq. 1.16 shows that the event rates for

forward scattering is a order of magnitude more than the backward scattering[28].

The detector which can provide the directional information would be powerful to

discriminate the background signal and also conﬁrm the measurement of dark matter

particles[29].

CHAPTER 1.

The WIMP-nucleus cross-section in Eq. 1.13 can be written as the sum of a

(1.18)

where f p,n denotes the contributions of protons and neutrons to the total coupling

strength, respectively, and µp is the WIMP-nucleon reduced mass. A, Z are mass

number and atomic number of target atom, respectively.

In general, f p = F n is

assumed such that the cross-section is scaled according to A2. Figure 1.8 shows

the event rate as a function of recoil energy and taking into account of form factor

correction for diﬀerent target material. For heavier elements will get higher events

rates but also suﬀer from larger nucleus causing loss of coherence. On the other hand,

the cross-section for spin-dependent can be determined from nuclear shell model[30,

31] :

eﬀective proton (neutron) coupling, (cid:104)Sp,n(cid:105) is the expectation value of the nuclear spin

content due to proton and neutron respectively. The chiral eﬀective-ﬁeld theory is

used to carry out the couplings of WIMPs to nucleons[32, 33]. These calculations

yield results in good agreement with the experimental data.

1.3.2 Detector Technologies

Various detector materials can be exploit to produce dark matter signal in terms of

phonon, charge or light signal. Phonon signal comes from the incident particle induce

the lattice vibrations. Typically, only few meV is needed to create a photon in the

solid target. For charged particles passing through a medium and ionize its atoms

and produced charges which can be collected by applying an electric ﬁeld. In semi-

conductor detector, few meV is required to create an electron-hole pair. While in

the liquid noble gas scintillator, the photons are emitted by the relaxation of excited

atom and the ionization energy is usually around 10-20 eV[35, 36]. For dark matter

direct detection, several goals need to be achieved to successfully detect signals :

• Large detector mass : More detector mass will increase the probability to ob-

serve signal of WIMP-nucleus recoil.

• Low energy threshold of detector : Low threshold allows the detector to observe

low energy deposit in the detector.

• Low background : Some background will mimic the WIMP’ signal while at

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

16

low energy the electronic recoil will also resemble the WIMP’s signal. Thus to

eliminate the background will improve the signal signiﬁcance.

• Stability : The detector need to be able to perform measurement continuously

for several years to accumulate good statistics due to very low event rate. Thus

a reliable and stable detector is needed.

1.3.3 Scintillator Crystal

Scintillators are frequently used in particle physics. When particle pass through the

crystal, the target atom will be excited and the subsequently de-excitation process

will emit scintillation lights. NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) are mostly commonly used in the

dark matter experiments. The scintillation lights are typically collected by Photo-

multiplier tube (PMT) provides the estimation of energy deposited by the incident

particle. They have advantages with the high density (3.7 and 4.5 g/cm3 for NaI

and CsI) which gives larger probability for incident particle to deposit its energy

in the detector target.

In addition, they have good energy resolution (8% for 1

MeV energy deposition) and lower energy threshold than other scintillator. However,

no particle discrimination is possible, only the rejection of multiple hits in diﬀerent

crystal can be achieved. Therefore, the low background environment with active

shielding are needed for crystal scintillator. The DAMA experiment at the LNGS

underground laboratory using ultra low-radioactive NaI(Tl) crystal [37]. With its

successor DAMA/LIBRA, the combined 1.33 ton/year exposure shows the annual

modulation signature of WIMPs-nucleus recoil[38]. Figure 1.9 shows the modulation

signal measured by DAMA. The maximum is agree with theoretical results at June

2nd within 2 σ. Moreover, the signiﬁcance of dark matter signal reaches 9.3 σ over a

measurement of 14 annual cycles[39]. DAMA experiment has demonstrated a stable

long-term operation of dark matter direct detection.

(maximum on June 2 nd). The ﬁgure covers the period between 1996 to 2007. Figure
from [40].

1.3.4 Semi-conductor Detector

Among semi-conductor detectors, the germanium detector is frequently choose to be

used for direct detection. The germanium has a high radio-purity target material and

a very low threshold (∼ 0.5 keVee) allowing to search for WIMPs down to masses

of a few GeV/c2. With such low threshold, the germanium detector usually operate

under the liquid nitrogen temperature to reduce the noise level. Moreover, the noise

level scales up with increasing crystal size due to increased capacitance, thus the

optimization of the detector is needed[41]. Germanium detector exhibit a excellent

energy resolution (0.15% at 1.3 MeV) which gives a ability to identify the background

sources and can be used to reduce the background. Although for discriminating

electronic recoil from nuclear recoil is not possible, the rise-time of the signal can

be used to discriminate surface backgrounds. CoGeNT experiment[42] utilizing p-

type point contact germanium detectors to do direct detection of dark matter. The

total mass of 443 g and has energy threshold at 500 eVee which has acquired 3.4

years of data in the Soudan Underground Laboratory. The annual modulation of

dark matter signal has been reported by the group[42], with a phase corresponding

to the expectation for WIMPs at a level of 2.2 σ. However, from several independent

CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF DARK MATTER

18

analysis using diﬀerent background model, no signiﬁcant signal was found[43, 44].

The results from CoGeNT is shown in Fig. 1.10.

1.3.5 Cryogenic Liquid noble gas detector

Liquid noble gas detector provides high light yield and advantage of building large

and homogenous detector. Currently, most experiments choose liquid argon (LAr)

or liquid xenon (LXe) for building detector for direct dark matter detection. Two

common design are used : single and dual phase. For single phase detector, the

scintillation light from particle interact with atoms is the only signal will be observed.

LAr is a good candidate for detector material due to the very diﬀerent lifetime for

two components in scintillation lights(see Chapter 2). This feature allows the LAr

to perform the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) and can be used to discriminate

electronic recoil from nuclear recoil. On the other hand, LXe is not suitable for

constructing single phase detector due to small diﬀerence of lifetime between two

components. However, with design of dual phase LXe detector, the ionization signal

can be used to do the PSD. In LXe dual phase detector, the ﬁrst signal comes from

liquid phase. The scintillation light in liquid phase will produce light signal (S1),

subsequently the electrons escape from ionization process will drift to the gaseous

phase at the top of detector due to the external applied electric ﬁeld (∼ 10 kV/cm).

When these electrons accelerated by external electric ﬁeld reaches the gaseous phase

will produce the scintillation light through electroluminescence and collect by the

PMTs (S2). Using the ratio of S1/S2, the discrimination of electronic recoil against

nuclear recoil can be achieved. Figure 1.11 shows the basic design schematic of both

single and dual phase liquid noble gas detector. Table 1.1 summarize current dark

matter experiments based on direct detection technique.

Thus far, no WIMPs signal has been conﬁrmed. Therefore, the exclusion plot of

WIMPs-nucleus cross-section is the results from each experiment at the moment. For

diﬀerent type of detector will have diﬀerent sensitive region on the exclusion plot.

where the Ethr represents the energy threshold of the detector and µA is the reduced

tor, usually have large mass but higher energy threshold, is most sensitive to larger

WIMP mass region. Conversely, the semi-conductor based detector has lower energy

threshold, thus can probe to lower recoil energy and sensitive to lower WIMP mass

region. However, they suﬀer from low mass of detector target, thus the probability

of observing the WIMP-nucleus recoil is smaller, results in reduction of overall sen-

sitivity. With improved discrimination also improves the overall sensitivity as shown

in right panel of Fig. 1.12. Figure 1.13 shows the latest experimental results on

exclusion plot. The results from each experiments is represent by color curve, and

the parameter space above the curve is excluded. Nowadays, experiments are focus

on speciﬁc region of parameter space to fully exploit the advantage of diﬀerent type

of detector.

Scintillation Process in Noble Liquid

and Gas

The scintillation light is the most important thing in single phase liquid noble gas

detector. Especially in liquid argon, the very diﬀerent decay time between fast and

slow component provides excellent pulse shape discrimination, table 2.1 summarize

the basic properties of liquid noble gas. It is necessary to understand the scintillation

process. Unfortunately, there has not yet a comprehensive theory to describe the

energy loss in liquid noble gas. However, many people have developed a working

theoretical frame work that allow people to put in simulation and get reasonable

results when compare to experimental data. To understand the process not only help

to optimize detector setup but also crucial for detector response function, which will

be useful when determine the energy scale of detector.

2.1 Particle energy transfer to liquid

The dominant scintillation process in liquid noble gas due to the impinged particle

is the scintillation light emitted by the lowest two vibrational states(1Σu, 3Σu)[58] :

the bound excited 1Σu molecular state (from 3P1 +1 S0 atomic state) and of the 3Σu

(from 3P2 +1 S0) to the repulsive ground state (see Fig. 2.1). The higher vibration

states will also emit the scintillation light at range of 110 nm, however, is suppressed

in the liquid(see Chapter2.2). Although the transition directly from 3Σu is forbidden,

through the spin-orbital coupling[59], there’s a small chance to transit to the ground

state and emit a photon. This results in rather long lifetime for LAr (∼ 1.5 µ s).

However, as the coupling becomes stronger for molecules with higher atomic number,

the triplet lifetime is signiﬁcantly shorter for LXe (∼ 27 ns).

These excited vibrational states are crated by either direct excitation from the

ground state or radiative cascades from higher excited atomic states (or ionic states

after recombination). The excitation process can be expressed :

e− + R → R∗ + e−

R∗ + 2R → R∗

2 + R

R∗

2 → 2R + γ

where R is noble element, R∗

2 is the excited states and γ is the VUV photon.

In

addition, the VUV photon can be emitted through the ionization and recombine with

electrons :

e− + R → R+ + 2e−

R+ + 2R → R∗

2 + R

CHAPTER 2. SCINTILLATION PROCESS IN NOBLE LIQUID AND GAS

25

R+

2 + e− → R∗∗ + R

R∗ ∗ +2R → R∗

2 + R

R∗

2 → 2R + γ

Note that the last step in recombination process is the same as the last step of exci-

tation process, the “dimer” state is formed and emit the VUV photon. The electrons

were ejected from atoms and undergo thermalization. The high-kinetic energy of the

electrons is transfer to the surrounding medium and become non-thermal. After that,

under the coulomb ﬁled of the parent atom (now positive ion), the electrons perform a

diﬀusive motion and may recombine with the positive ion or escape and becomes free

electrons. For those free electrons, further recombination is possible. With external

applied electric ﬁled, these electrons may be collected to provide the ionization signal

in dual phase detector (see Chapter 1.3.5)

For diﬀerent type of incident particles, the diﬀerent degree of energy will transfer

during the reaction and results in diﬀerent ratio of the excitation/ionization process.

For the electron recoil, assuming energy E0 is transferred by incident particle, three

processes will share the energy :

ionization, excitation and non-radiative process

(heat). The E0 can be written as:

E0 = NiEi + NexEex + Niη,

(2.1)

where Ei and Eex are the mean energy to create ionization and excitation; Ni and Nex

are the mean number of ionized and excited atoms, respectively. η is the mean energy

of secondary electrons which is generated in the ﬁrst ionization and subsequently

excite or ionize other atoms. Below such energy, the electrons will just participate

the elastic scattering and raises the temperature of the medium. It is found that the

band structure of electronic states in solid noble gas also present in the liquiﬁed noble

(2.2)

The band gap was found to be Eg = 14.2 eV for argon and 9.28 eV for xenon [61].

pair. Eq. 2.2 can be further rewritten as :

(2.3)

The experimental W-value for argon is 23.6 ± 0.3 eV[35] and 15.6 ±0.3 for xenon[36].

In addition, theoretical calculation[36] of the ratio of Nex/Ni for argon (0.21) is in

good agreement with experimental results (0.19[62]). However, for liquid xenon, the

discrepancy between experimental data (0.20) and calculation(0.06[36]) is shown.

CHAPTER 2. SCINTILLATION PROCESS IN NOBLE LIQUID AND GAS

The photon yield (Wph) can be expressed in terms of the W-value and the ratio

of number of excitations to the ionizations.

Wph =

.

(2.4)

The diﬀerent incident particle will transfer diﬀerent amount of energy which results

in diﬀerent ratio of the excitations to the ionization, ultimately depends on the linear

energy transfer (LET). The relative light yield as a function of LET is shown in Fig.

2.2. The ﬂat top response corresponds to the region where each of the excited and

ionized species created by incident particle gives a photon. Notice that at low LET

region the light yield decreases. This can be explained by Onsager theory[64], in the

ionization process, an electrons is slowed down to thermal energy within the Onsager

radius from the parent ion. These electrons can not escape from the parent ion and

the electron-ion pair recombination take place. The electron thermalization length in

liquid argon is around 1500-1800 nm[65] and for xenon is around 4000-5000 nm[66].

These value are larger than Onsager radius (127 nm for liquid argon and 49 nm for

liquid xenon). For high LET value created by nuclear recoil, a highly excited and

ionized track is created by incident particle. Therefore, for electrons escape from the

parent ion, there is a high probability that they will recombine with other ions in the

track. However, for low LET, when these electrons escape from the parent ion, their

lifetime in the liquid could be > ms even without the external electric ﬁeld applied,

results in losing of light yield.

In the high LET region, the process suﬀered from

“biexcitonic quenching”[67].

R∗ + R∗ → R + R+ + e−,

The two excitons collide with each other and results in non-radiative reaction. The

excessive energy is carried away by the electrons which close to one excitation energy.

These electrons will consume its energy before the further recombination. Conversely

the R+ can undergo the recombination with other electrons to produce a new excited

state. This process will emit on photon, however, at the cost of two photons from

original two excitons. This “biexcitonic quenching” eﬀects mainly responsible for the

reduction of light yield.

In the nuclear recoil, not all the energy goes into producing excitation and ioniza-

tion of the atoms. The nuclear stopping power deﬁned as the amount of energy per

unit length due to that transfer to recoiled atom in the form of kinetic energy. The

energy reduction factor (fn) from Lindhard et al.[69] can be written :

fn =

kg((cid:15))
1 + kg((cid:15))

,

(2.5)

For nucleus has atomic number A and Z protons, (cid:15) = 11.5ER(keV )Z −7/3, k =

0.133Z 2/3A−1/2 and g((cid:15)) = 3(cid:15)0.15 + 0.7(cid:15)0.6 + (cid:15). The reduction factor as a function

of recoil energy for diﬀerent liquid noble element is shown in Fig. 2.3. In addition,

the biexcitonic quenching introduce a extra quenching factor which can be deﬁned

CHAPTER 2. SCINTILLATION PROCESS IN NOBLE LIQUID AND GAS

29

using Birk’s saturation[70]:

fl =

1
1 + kB dEe
dx

.

(2.6)

where dEe/dx represents the electronic stopping power, k is the collision probability at

the core of the track, and A, kB are determined experimentally. The total scintillation

eﬃciency(qf ) can be obtained by

qf = fn × fl.

(2.7)

The results from [70] predicts the total scintillation eﬃciency for diﬀerent liquid noble

elements is shown in Fig. 2.4. The scintillation eﬃciency of nuclear recoil relative to

the electronic recoil can then be deﬁned as :

Lef f =

Eer · nγ,nr
nγ,er · Enr

,

(2.8)

where the Enr and Eer are the recoil energy of nuclear recoil and electronic recoil;

nγ,nr and nγ,er are the number of photons detected in nuclear and electronic recoil

respectively. In the recent experimental study, the experimental measured Lef f seems

disagree with the theoretical calculation using Lindhard theory and Birk’s law as

shown in Fig. 2.5. Note that at low recoil energy, the theory predicts a down turn

which means the light yield decreased, and is in agreement with earlier experimental

results[71]. NEST [72] developed a theoretical prediction to explain this phenomenon

in liquid xenon[73]. However, in the liquid argon, the experimental results from

MicroCLEAN [74] and W. Creus et al.[75] shows a up turn experimental data points,

suggesting in low recoil energy, the light yield increased. No comprehensive theory

has developed yet to explain the exact behavior in all energy region. According to

W. Creus et al.[75], this phenomenon could due to increasing ratio of exciton-ion in

elements. Plot is taken from [70].

low recoil energy region. In that case, the light yield will increase since the exciton

required less energy to emit the photons.

2.2 Scintillation Process in Gaseous Argon

The gaseous argon has been widely investigated throughout the literature. The com-

mon application includes high pressure argon gas for UV laser, scintillation counter

and dark matter detection etc. The scintillation light emit from gaseous argon by im-

pinging charged particle, heavy ions or neutral particles is a well known phenomenon.

When the particles pass through the gas, it creates so-called "excimer" states along the

particle track. These "excimer" states are either in the form of singlet excimer state

(1Σ+

u ) or triplet excimer state (3Σ+

u ). Subsequently through the direct de-excitation

or recombination the scintillation light are emitted in the process. The lifetime for

singlet and triplet state are 6 ns and 3.2 µs respectively. The triplet lifetime has been

measured by various groups(Table 9.1), the main reason for the diﬀerences of mea-

sured lifetime is from impurity eﬀect.[76] When the impurities present in the gaseous

CHAPTER 2. SCINTILLATION PROCESS IN NOBLE LIQUID AND GAS

32

argon (O2, N2, H2O, etc.) , there’s a chance that argon excimer collide with impurities

and going through a non-radiative collisional reaction. Thus this quenching process is

in competition with the de-excitation process leading to VUV light emission. The sin-

glet states are not aﬀected by this process due to its very fast decay time. Therefore,

the impurity eﬀect mainly involved with triplet states, subsequently reduce the triplet

lifetime. Thus the measured triplet lifetime is a good indicator for understanding the

impurity level in GAr.

Traditionally, the scintillation light emitted from gaseous argon is considered from

the de-excitation process of two lowest vibration state (1Σ+

u , 3Σ+

u ) to the ground state

(1Σ+

g ) with characteristic wavelength peak at 128 nm. To detect the VUV scintilla-

tion light, the detector usually equipped with wavelength shifter (e.g. TPB) which

can convert the VUV light to visible region where the PMT has highest detecting

eﬃciency. The wavelength shifter will integrate all the scintillation light in VUV/UV

region and convert them to visible photons. The emitted scintillation light from 128

nm is dominant at typical operation pressure of detector (> 1bar), however,there

are actually some scintillation light from some other wavelength contribute to the

total scintillation light. Fig 2.6a and 2.6b show the spectral of scintillation light in

VUV/UV region.

In atomic physics, these spectral line are referred to three continua. The ﬁrst con-

tinuum ranges from 104 nm - 110 nm, second continuum peak at 128 nm and the third

continuum ranges from 180 nm - 230 nm. The origin of the second continuum is men-

tioned above, from the two lowest lying vibrational states of (3P1 and 3P2) as shown

in Fig 2.7.[76] The ﬁrst continuum share the same origin with second continuum but

from higher vibrational states.[77][78] The origin of third continuum still under de-

bate, several author have been trying to explain the kinetics behind it.[79][80][81][82].

From most recent research, it seems at least four diﬀerent states are involved in the

process and possibly from three body collision of Ar++ (Ar+∗) with ground state argon

CHAPTER 2. SCINTILLATION PROCESS IN NOBLE LIQUID AND GAS

33

atom. This process lead to the creation of Ar++

2

(Ar+∗) and then decay radiatively. In

general, these three continua are pressure dependent. In ﬁg.2.6a, the intensity of ﬁrst

continuum decreased with pressure increased. On the other hand, at low pressure

the second continuum is not obvious, it becomes dominant when the pressure reaches

600 Torr while the ﬁrst continuum is negligible.[78][77] In the very low pressure (<10

mTorr), the lifetime of ﬁrst continuum is around 160 ns[83], however with increased

pressure it suﬀered from radiation trapping or imprisonment.[84][85] The simpli-

ﬁed explanation is following : at low pressure the density of argon is also low (consider

ﬁxed T), so when the excited argon decay to the ground state, the released photons

can easily escape from the gas without being absorbed. Conversely, when the pres-

sure increased (density increased), the released photons can go through re-absorb and

re-emit process many times such that we observer these photons late in the time. In

the other words, the lifetime of these higher vibrational states are unchanged (natural

lifetime) but the observed lifetime increased (apparent lifetime). The apparent life-

time for ﬁrst continuum can be as long as 8 µs[85]. From the semiclassical calculation,

the ratio of intensity from second continua and ﬁrst continua(I2/I1) increases with

pressure increased(Fig. 2.8a). For the second continuum, the formation of two low-

est lying excited states are from three-body collision, so at low density(low pressure)

the eﬃciency for forming these two states is low compare to the high density(high

pressure). The diﬀerence of lifetime between singlet and triplet states is due to the

forbidden transition from triplet to ground state. However, at short internuclear dis-

tance, spin-orbit coupling splits the triplet states, giving a slight oscillator strength

to the ground state.

It is also interesting to consider the timing analysis of these three continuum. The

following discussion will be constraint to the pressure larger than 1 bar, since the ﬁrst

continua is suppressed under this pressure region, I will focus on the second and third

continuum. In the early time, the scintillation light is dominant by third continuum

CHAPTER 2. SCINTILLATION PROCESS IN NOBLE LIQUID AND GAS

34

and 155 nm peak, while the second continuum shows up later in the time[86]. In the

early stage of excitation and ionization process, there are several scintillation process

competing with each other and results in the slowing down the production of Ar∗
2.

The rate constant of diﬀerent kinetic reactions can be found in [87]. Fig.2.9 shows

a decomposed of the diﬀerent components of scintillation light. This shows that the

long time constant is mainly from the decay of the triplet states of Ar∗

2 (The ﬁrst

continuum has been suppressed under pressure > 1 bar).

The impurities in gaseous argon will lead to the quenching of the light yield and

the decreased triplet lifetime through the Jesse eﬀect[88]. In the MiniCLEAN cold

gas run, the detector is operating at 1.5 bar and 120 K, the dominant impurities

are from N2 and O2. When the impurities exist in the argon gas, the precursor of

excimer states might have chance to collide with the impurities and then go through

non-radiative collisional reaction.

Where R = O,N. These processes has been widely investigated in the following

literature[89][76][90][91], and the rate constant and cross-section for speciﬁc impu-

rity can be found in [79]. The detail study using MninCLEAN’s cold gas data will be

present in Chapter 9.

MiniCLEAN Detector

The detail description of MiniCLEAN detector is provided in this chapter.

3.1 Detector overview

The Cryogenic Low Energy Astrophysics with Noble Liquids (CLEAN) program

utilize the liquid argon as the detector target. The detector is designed as a monolithic

detector with maximum coverage of photomultiplier tubes viewing the active target.

The liquid argon is held in a stainless steel Inner Vessel (IV) and surrounded by 92

optical cassettes (Fig. 3.1). The scintillation light in VUV range emitted from LAr

is collected by 92 PMTs. The Hamamatsu R5912-02MOD photomultipliers has 8

inches diameters with borosilicate glass, the spectral response is shown in Fig. 3.2.

The VUV scintillation light from argon is shifted to visible by Tetraphenyl butadiene

(TPB) wavelength shifter (Fig. 3.3). Each PMT is installed in a optical cassette as

shown in Fig. 3.1. A 10 cm in thickness acrylic plug with TPB coated surface which

is in contact of active volume is installed on the other end of cassette. In addition, the

acrylic plug can moderate the neutron ﬂux from the residual impurities in PMT glass

which generated through U,Th (α,n) decay chain. In order to improve the reﬂectivity

of inside the optical cassette, the surface of light guide are lined with VikuitiT M

37

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

38

ESR foil by 3M. The light guides has diﬀerent shape to maximize the coverage of the

active volume. There are regular pentagon (12 ports), regular hexagon (20 ports) and

irregular hexagon (60 ports) and is installed in diﬀerent location of the port on IV

sphere. The gaps between the optical cassettes are covered by ESR foil to minimize

the photon leakage. The IV is held through three hangers inside the Outer Vessel

(OV) which is pumped down to vacuum to serve as thermal insulation of IV. The OV

is sitting on a stand via a set of springs which dampen relative moment between the

Cube Hall ﬂoor and the deck. The OV is inside an 18 ft diameter by 26 ft tall water

tank (Fig. 3.4) which provides shielding from external radiation to the detector. The

water tank is located in the Cube Hall which is 6800 ft (6000 mwe) below surface in

SNOLAB, sudbury, Canada.

3.2 Data Acquisition System

The DAQ system is build around 12 CAEN V1720 WFDs and each of WFD pick

PMT pulses oﬀ of their HV lines, assembling pulses into events and saving to the

disk. Both the PMT signals and high voltage are transmit along a single cable (Gore

30 AWG in the OV vacuum and RG-68 in air). A custom VME crete is housing the

WFDs and fed signal from the PMTs via the HV-Block modules and are triggered

by the VENTOR triggering system. Each WFD has 8 channel with 12-bit resolution

over 2 V peak-to-peak input and 250 MHz sampling rate. The default length of

the digitized waveform is set to 16 µs, which is approximately ten times of the slow

scintillation time constant for LAr. The input signal from PMTs is digitized and

output a signal if the number of channels above a programmable threshold. The

hit sum (NHit) deﬁned as ﬁve or more channels have crossed threshold within 16 ns

coincidence window. The external triggers are allowed to trigger DAQ for calibration

purposes. The diagram of the DAQ system is shown in Fig. 3.5. The digitizer

provides diﬀerent waveform reduction to save the disk space. During the warm gas

runs, the trigger rate is around 400 Hz, thus to store full waveform data for every

events is impractical due to heavy traﬃc on data transferring. Therefore, the zero

suppressed data (Zero Length Encoding) is stored. In ZLE mode, the region where

the no samples cross the threshold will be discard. In addition, where the samples

has crossed threshold, the programmable length pre- and post-sample regions are also

stored in each ZLE block. Upon the trigger, the event summary was send to a PC

which, in real time, determines wether the event could be of interest based on the

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

41

amount of charge (prompt and late), and charge centroid. The event is categorized

depending on the event summary information, the DAQ system records them as either

full ZLE waveform, summary information for each ZLE block, or summary data on

channel level. The detail description can be found in Appendix C.

Figure 3.5: The diagram of DAQ system.

3.3 Puriﬁcation and Cryogenic System

The purpose of puriﬁcation system is to further purify the argon and remove the

radon particles in the argon. The purity of argon aﬀects both triplet lifetime and

the light yield. With high impurity level of argon (>10 ppb), the triplet lifetime

is decreased which worsen the pulse shape discrimination and the energy resolution

(See Chapter 9). Therefore to obtain pure argon is a key for successful measurement.

The liquid argon purchased from AirLique has purity level as 99.999%. For each

dewar before connect to the puriﬁcation system, is checked by Residual Gas Analyzer

(RGA) to conﬁrmed the required impurity level is met. The boil-oﬀ argon from argon

dewar is further puriﬁed by a SAES PS4-MT3-R-1 zirconium puriﬁer. The SAES

getter requires 99.999% inlet argon gas.

In addition, the freezing point of radon

(202 K) is well above the temperature of LAr, thus boil-oﬀ gas from LAr contains

signiﬁcant less radon than the output of gas cylinders. However, when the dewar

begins to empty, the radon and other contaminants are readily boiled, thus the argon

quality needs to be constantly monitor by RGA. The getter reduces most impurities

(H2,H2O,CO,CO2,CH4,N2,O2, etc.) to below ppb concentration at ﬂow rates of 5-20

SLPM. For higher ﬂow rates (20-50 SLPM), the getter with lower electronegativity

only reduces the impurities to below 10 ppb concentrations. Radon is not readily

removed by the getter which requires additional puriﬁcation through cryo-adsorption

within an activated charcoal trap. The charcoal trap is cooled down to below radon

freezing point such that with its large surface area, radon cryo-absorbs while allowing

the puriﬁed argon to exit the trap. The schematic of argon ﬂow is shown in Fig. 3.6

and the puriﬁcation system is shown in 3.7

Figure 3.6: The schematic of puriﬁcation system.

In the original design, the cryogenic system consists of a Giﬀord-McMahon cry-

ocooler mounted on the OV-D ﬂange with 24 ﬂexible OFHC copper braids extending

to OFHC copper cold ﬁngers mounted on two of the IV’s 3 inches diameter ports

as shown in Fig. 3.8. The cooling power is from a pair of high pressure, vacuum

jacketed helium lines which created a closed loop between cryocooler and the helium

compressor. The calculated heat load of IV during normal operation is in Table 3.1.

The Multilayer insulation (MLI) installed on OV surface greatly reduced the thermal

radiation. The cooling power of cryocooler is shown in Fig. 3.9. The helium temper-

ature at 40-50 K has suﬃcient cooling power to liquefy and maintain the LAr target.

The IV temperature is monitored by 5 silicon diode temperature sensors mounted on

the diﬀerent locations of IV sphere. The temperature controller is linked to a set of

four DC power supplies which are connected in parallel to a pair of 500 W Omegalux

cartridge heaters which used to control the temperature of cold ﬁnger to maintain at

suitable temperature and prevent the argon condensed on the cold ﬁnger such that

reduces the cooling power.

3.4 39Ar Spike

The primary goal of MiniCLEAN detector is to test the PSD background rejection

ability. The intrinsic 39Ar beta decay produces the electronic recoil which could leak

into the region of nuclear recoil. With larger mass of LAr, the 39Ar background limit

energy threshold for single phase detector. To test the PSD background rejection

ability, 39Ar spike is injected into the LAr to increase the concentration of 39Ar back-

ground. A concentrated sample of 39Ar will be mixed with natural argon and injected

into the detector through the gas process system. The 39Ar spike samples has been

produced at LANL by irradiating a potassium target with neutrons above 2 MeV and

the 39Ar is produced through the 39K(n,p)39Ar reaction. This allows the MiniCLEAN

detector to test the ultimate PSD achievable in a single phase LAr detector as a func-

tion of energy. Moreover, the results can be informative for future detector design

for the size and energy threshold needed. In addition, with increased concentration

of 39Ar, the pileup of electronic recoils with potential WIMP nuclear recoils induces

an eﬀective pileup dead time. In typical data taking with the 39 spike injected, PSD

techniques assumes in the event window (16 µ s) only the recoil of interest happened.

However, with increasing 39Ar rate. the process becomes non-trival, and the resulting

“dead time” eﬀectively reduces the mass of the detector as shown in Fig. 3.10. To

test the 39Ar concentration in tens of tonnes detector with MiniCLEAN detector (0.5

tonnes), at least a 200 times spike would be required according to the Fig. 3.10.

3.5 Simulation and Analysis Software

The data analysis and the simulation are done by analysis package RAT. RAT in-

corporate the analysis software ROOT , simulation package GEANT4 and integrate

with the DAQ system, originally developed by the Braidwood collaboration[95]. The

aim of RAT is to provide a tool for photomultiplier-based detectors with scintillation

targets. The particle propagation of the electromagnetic, hadronic physics process

and the detector geometry implementation are done by GEANT4. In addition, the

add-on package (GLG4 scintillation) handles the scintillation and ﬂuoresces process

and generates photons according to the type and amount of energy deposited in the

desired material. For both data taking and simulation, the ROOT framework handles

the data processing and storage. RAT simulates the following detector eﬀects :

• GEANT4 handles the propagation of primary and secondary particles, including

the electrons, gamma rays, nuclear recoils and neutrons through the detector

materials.

• The UV(VUV) scintillation light produced by charged particles in the liquid

argon.

• The propagation of individual VUV photons and the optical properties of de-

tector material including the wavelength shifted photons.

• PMT simulation including the realistic pulses shape, timing and charge, as well

as the pre-pulsing, late-pulsing, double-pulsing and after-pulsing.

• Simulates the detector triggering, the digitized waveform, the waveform reduc-

tion of zero-suppressed mode.

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

47

The simulation events and physical events from detector trigger are treated in the

same way in RAT. For every iteration of events, a series of self-contained “processor”

performed diﬀerent task on the events such as extract raw data, calibration, pulse

ﬁnding, event reconstruction, etc. User can deﬁned their own processor to perform

desired function on the events.

3.5.1 Discriminant Parameters

Several basic parameters are deﬁned to preserve the data quality. For the scintillation

light produced by diﬀerent particle incident on LAr target which described in detail

in Chapter 2 can be used to deﬁned a discriminant parameters. The electronic recoil

tend to produce more fraction of late light (triplet) than nuclear recoil. Thus the

prompt-fraction, Fp (Fprompt ) is deﬁned as :

fp =

(cid:82) η
Ti
(cid:82) Tf
Ti

V (t)dt

V (t)dt

(3.1)

where V (t) is the voltage waveform, Ti is some time before the maximum of the

prompt peak which has been calibrated as time zero, Tf is the end of acquisition

window and η is depending on the timing characteristic of the scintillator. In Mini-

CLEAN, the time window to acquire prompt charge has been optimized through

simulation. The start time Ti is 28 ns before the maximum of the prompt peak and

η is 80 ns after the maximum of the prompt peak. The example of using Fprompt as

discriminant parameter to separate electronic and nuclear recoil in LAr is shown in

Fig. 3.11.

The charge ratio (QR) can be used to determine the preliminary charge distribu-

tion within 92 PMTs. It is deﬁned as the ratio of maximum charge in the PMTs to the

total charge in the given event. In data, it is useful to discriminate against non-argon

scintillation events. The example of the QR-Fp distribution is shown in Fig. 3.12. In

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

48

this ﬁgure, the group of events in the low QR comes from electronic recoil induced by

intrinsic 39Ar beta decay. The events in high QR comes from instrument eﬀects and

Cherenkov light in the acrylic (see Ch. 8).

3.5.2 Event Reconstruction

The charge centroid is used to reconstruct the event position, it is deﬁned as :

(cid:126)R =

(cid:80)
i

(cid:126)ri · Q2
i

(cid:80)
i

Q2
i

(3.2)

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

49

where (cid:126)ri is the position of the i’th PMT and Qi is the total charge in that PMT.

However, the charge centroid reconstruction is biased inward. The collaboration

developed more sophisticated reconstruction method “Shellﬁt” to reconstruct energy

and the position with better position resolution. The Shellﬁt is based on the maximum

likelihood ﬁt and incorporate with the optical properties of TPB. The four assumption

about the detector conﬁguration in the likelihood function :

1. The detector is approximately spherically symmetric with respect to waveguide

placement and the conﬁguration.

2. Scintillation light is isotropically emitted from the event vertex.

3. TPB is applied to a spherical shell or ﬁxed radius.

4. TPB absorption and reemission is isotropic, with no directional information

from the incoming UV photon passing to the reemitted visible photon(s).

With these assumptions, the charge likelihood function for the events is

L(NU V , (cid:126)rev) =

M
(cid:89)

i=1

P (qi| (cid:126)C((cid:126)ri, NU V , (cid:126)rev)),

(3.3)

where qi is the charge in the i’th PMT, (cid:126)ri is the position of i(cid:48)th PMT, (cid:126)C((cid:126)ri, NU V , (cid:126)rev)

is the mean number of photoelectrons detected by a PMT t position (cid:126)ri, given an

event at (cid:126)rev which produces NU V scintillation photons. With observed charge qi in
each PMT, the probability density P (qi|C) gives the mean charges (cid:126)C according to
the Poisson distribution. The expected mean number of photoelectrons (cid:126)C at PMT i

can be computed by smapling the detector response at N points, (cid:126)pi distributed over

the TPB surface uniform in solid angle relative o the event position (cid:126)rev Therefore,

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

the expected number of photoelectrons can be calculated by

(cid:126)C((cid:126)ri, NU V , (cid:126)rev) = NU V

(3.4)

where the θij is the angle in radians between the PMT position vector (cid:126)ri and the

TPB sample point (cid:126)pj. The E(θij) is the detector response function which gives the

number of detected photoelectrons at PMT i given that the probability of a UV

photon absorbed at (cid:126)pj. To convert the mean photoelectrons to a charge distribution,

the single photoelectron distribution is used. The results from charge centroid ﬁt,

Shellﬁt using integral charge and shellﬁt using SPE distribution is shown in Fig.

3.13. The results shows a dramatic improvement on the resolution of reconstructed

radius. However, the shellﬁt required a scintillation target , and deﬁnite timing p.d.f.

of scintillation timing proﬁle. Therefore, the analysis in vacuum and gas run will use

the charge centroid ﬁt to perform the event reconstruction.

3.5.3 Pulse Finding

A sliding integration window of 12 ns (3 samples) is used to scan the calibrated wave-

forms to identify the pulse. The pulse is extracted whenever the integral exceeds

5 times the RMS of noise samples times the square root of the number of samples

in the window. The boundaries of the pulse region is deﬁned when the sliding win-

dow integral drops o below the RMS divided by the square root of the number of

samples. Figure 3.14 shows a example pulse found by the pulse ﬁnding. A new al-

gorithm developed by MiniCLEAN[98] utilizing the Baye’s theorem to improve the

estimation of single photoelectron arrival time. Using the bayesian technique and the

characteristic scintillation timing proﬁle for diﬀerent type of recoil to estimate the

single photoelectron arrival time. In addition, the energy reconstructed by Shellﬁt

can provide more accurate information on photoelectron statistics, then as a prior to

the Baye’s theorem to get better results. The example using Bayesian technique to

estimated the single photoelectron arrival time is shown in Fig. 3.15.

Figure 3.14: A typical voltage waveform from a single PMT in MiniCLEAN Monte
Carlo simulation. The top panel shows the waveform normalized by 5 times the RMS
of the electronics noise proﬁle (black, solid) compared to the sliding integral value
normalized by the corresponding threshold (blue, dashed)[94].

3.5.4 Particle Identiﬁcation Using Likelihood Method

The Fprompt parameters is useful for identify the electronic recoil from nuclear recoil.

However, in low energy region, the Fprompt value for electronic recoil leaks into the

nuclear recoil region. The MiniCLEAN collaboration developed new parameters to

improve the discrimination power. With the single photoelectron time estimated

by Bayesian technique (Chapter 3.5.3) for an event ζ, a discrimination variable Lr

can be deﬁned as a normalized log-likelihood diﬀerence, comparing the nuclear recoil

hypothesis with the electronic recoil hypothesis :

Lr =

1
m

(cid:88)

(logPn(t|E) − logPe(t|E)),

t∈ζ

(3.5)

where m is the number of photoelectrons in the event, Pn (Pe)is the time probability

density function for the nuclear recoil (electronic recoil) hypothesis given the energy

E. Positive value of Lr indicates the event is more nuclear recoil-like, and negative are

more electronic recoil-like. Comparing Lr to Fprompt and a simple statistic rp which

is a discrete version of fp using the single photon arrival time estimated by Bayesian

technique :

rp =

|{t|t ∈ ζ ∧ Ti < t < (cid:15)}|
|{t|t ∈ ζ ∧ Ti < t < Tf }|

,

where (cid:15) deﬁned the prompt window (same as fp), Ti and Tf is the start time and

the end time for counting window respectively. Figure 3.16 shows the comparison

between these discriminant parameters.

calibration events in DEAP-1 with 30 PE. The vertical dashed line indicates 50%
nuclear recoil acceptance at 6.7 keVee. The Lr values have been linearly transformed
such that the median values for the electron and nuclear recoil distributions match
those for fp[98].

3.6 Background

The summary of backgrounds of MiniCLEAN detector is described in the following

sections.

3.6.1 External Backgrounds

The MiniCLEAN detector locate at 6800 ft underground in SNOLAB. The muon ﬂux

is signiﬁcant reduced in the underground laboratory. The muon ﬂux as a function of

depth is shown in Fig. 3.17. The muon ﬂux at SNOLAB underground laboratory is

less than 0.27 µ/m2/day[99]. The gamma ray ﬂux from the rock is measured by SNO

experiment and is tabulated in Table 3.2. The actual rate for MiniCLEAN detector

will be lower due to the shielding of the water tank.The fast neutron ﬂux from the

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

54

rock is estimated to be 400 neutrons/m2/day. The simulation shows the ﬂux of fast

neutron is reduced to much less than unity by the water shielding.

3.6.2

Internal Backgrounds

The potential internal background source of MiniCLEAN are :

• intrinsic 39Ar beta decay.

• Gamma from PMTs and IV/OV steel.

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

55

• fast neutrons from (α,n) processes in the PMT bulb and IV/OV steel.

• Alpha decays from radon daughter.

The aim of MiniCLEAN is to eliminate these background in the ﬁducial volume (∼

150 kg) and an energy region of interest corresponding to 75-150 photoelectrons. The

radioactive isotope 39Ar has radioactivity of 1Bq/kg. It will produce the electrons

through the beta decay with half-life 269 years and end point energy 565 keV. In

order to obtain a background free ﬁducial argon volume over one year, the required

PSD rejection ability needs to be better than parts per billion. However, it can be

used as a calibration source to monitor the detector health and reconstruction bias.

The detail description is in Chapter 10.

The gamma ray can be produced by the relaxation of alpha-emitters in the 238U

and 232Th decay chains. The estimated rates is 808 mBq from 238U and 421 for

232Th. These gammas may produce the Compton electrons both in LAr and acrylic

plug to create the Cherenkov light in the acrylic or electronic recoil in the liquid. The

simulation of 238U and 232Th decay chain in OV/IV steel, PMT glass, and light guide

steel/acrylic shows no events survived after all cuts. The results is summarized in

Table 3.3.

The primary source of fast neutrons come from the (α,n) interactions due to the

238U and 232Th both in the borosilicate glass of the PMTs and steel. Fast neutron

will scatter elastically and inelastically from the target nuclei and produce a signal

that is indistinguishable from a WIMP signal. Table 3.4 summarize the intrinsic

radioactivity of the major components of the MiniCLEAN detector. The calculation

from Mei et al [100] predicts the neutrons from 66 kg of PMT glass are 42000 neutrons

per year. A similar calculation for the steel IV and OV predicts a neutron yield of

1800 per year. Figure 3.18 shows the energy spectrum for PMT neutrons. The PMT

neutrons can be moderated by a 10-cm acrylic plug in the light guides. In addition,

20 cm LAr self-shielding also contribute to moderate the neutron from PMT or steel

CHAPTER 3. MINICLEAN DETECTOR

56

to get into the ﬁducial volume. The alpha decays of radon daughters deposit on

the TPB will induces the alpha-TPB scintillation. In addition, the nucleus in the

alpha decay will be injected into the LAr volume and create a signal in the region of

interest. The detail description on identifying and discriminating against these events

is in Chapter 7.

Construction and Cooling of

MiniCLEAN detector

The construction and cooling of MiniCLEAN detector is described in this chapter.

The author maintained a full-time presence on-site at SNOLAB from February 2014

to May 2015, from the middle of detector assembly to the start of the detector cool

down.

4.1 Inner Vessel Assembly

The MiniCLEAN inner and outer vessels arrived on-site in Sudbury in Fall 2012. The

construction of IV starts in early 2013. The PMTs and the DAQ system are tested

in Boston University and shipped to SNOLAB in summer 2013. The author made

several trips to SNOLAB in 2013 to install the LED pulser system and assist the

PMT installation. The base and neck of each PMT are conformal coated to prevent

the extra impedance through the Gas/Liquid as shown in Fig. 4.3. However, during

the conformal coating, some material drip along the glass bulb which might ﬂake oﬀ

inside the IV during the cooling. Therefore, a thorough examination of PMT was

performed to remove these substance.

57

CHAPTER 4. CONSTRUCTION AND COOLING OF MINICLEAN DETECTOR 58

The assembly of IV was performed in the softwall cleanroom (SWCR Fig. 4.1)

modiﬁed to maintain a low radon atmosphere with provided compressed air. The

radon level indie the SWCR is monitored with a RAD 7 radon monitor as shown

in Fig. 4.2. After the assembly, each time the IV is open to the cleanroom space,

the boil-of nitrogen gas is used to purge the cleanroom atmosphere to minimize the

chance to leak radon into the IV. The optical cassettes house the PMT, and the top

hat provides electrical feedthrough for connect the PMT HV/signal cable to the OV.

The VikuitiT M ESR foil lined the inner surface of the optical cassettes. When the

ESR foil shipped to the SNOLAB, a thin layer of plastic to prevent the foil from

scratch is removed outside the SWCR. However, when removing the plastic foil, the

electrostatic force attract the radon particles to deposit onto the foil. This create

excessive events in ESR foil scintillation which described in detail in Chapter 7.3.

After completion of IV assembly, the IV is ﬁlled with the argon gas. The DAQ

system and the puriﬁcation system (without charcoal trap) is then tested. The IV

has been tested throughly with DAQ and puriﬁcation system by the summer of 2014.

Subsequently, the preparation of moving IV into OV start while IV sit in the vacuum

with continuously data taking to ensure the stability.

the introduction of mine air into the clean room by a portable air conditioner which
was being tested. During assembly, radon levels in the clean room were typically 1-2
pCi/L while underground air typically contains 4-5 pCi/L of radon[94].

CHAPTER 4. CONSTRUCTION AND COOLING OF MINICLEAN DETECTOR 60

4.2 Outer Vessel Assembly

The Outer vessel are assembled on the Cube Hall ﬂoor, and leak checked after assem-

bly. The stand which support the OV was constructed inside the water tank. The

seismic analysis indicates that the OV on a relatively rigid stand would not support

the weight of IV in SNOLAB’s design seismic event. Later , a spring support system

was designed to mitigate the seismic hazard. Which reduce the movement of the OV

and IV to approximately 1.5 mm in the 4.3 magnitude (on Nuttli scale) design seismic

event. Figure 4.4 shows the spring support system.

When IV is contained in the OV vacuum space, the dominant heat transfer comes

from the thermal radiation form the OV. The multi-layer insulation (MLI) is often

used in the cryogenic system. It is consisting of alternating layers of poor thermal

conductivity and high IR-reﬂectivity which can reduce the heat load on the cryogenic

body. After the calculation which taking into account of the heat load of MiniCLEAN

detector (Fig. 4.5), a 10 layers multi-layer insulation is applied to the inner surface

of OV. The MLI layers are cut and prepared in the Cryo-pit, the krypton type was

used to attached the MLI layers on to the inner surface of OV as shown in Fig. 4.6.

Each MLI layer is 400 angstroms thick with a thermal emissivity of 0.03.

The IV was moved into OV on November 17, 2014, as mentioned in last section,

IV is prepared in the Cryo-pit and transported to the Cube Hall. During the trans-

portation, the IV is ﬁlled with argon gas and kept the positive pressure in case a leak

is created during the transportation. Figure 4.7 (a) shows the IV is on the move to

the Cube Hall, and Fig. 4.7 (b) shows the ﬁnal examination of the IV before lifting.

Subsequently, the IV was hoisted into the OV and suspended with three supporting

arms as shown in Fig. 4.8. A scaﬀolding was build around the OV for easy to access

diﬀerent elevation of OV to perform the ﬁnal assembly. The copper components visi-

ble near the top of the IV make the connection to the cryogenic refrigerator which is

mounted on the top dome of the OV.

CHAPTER 4. CONSTRUCTION AND COOLING OF MINICLEAN DETECTOR 61

Figure 4.4: The spring support system for the OV.

A series of instrument cabling from IV to OV were carefully arranged in the

following months. After the completion of connection of cable, the top dome of the

OV was lowered to its position. The cables of the air-side of the PMTs and instrument

are housed in the water-proof hoses and extend to the deck to connect to the DAQ

system and the corresponding equipment. The cooling lines are installed which extend

to the top of water tank. The cryogenic and puriﬁcation system connects to the OV

from the deck and ﬂow the gaseous argon into the IV to maintain the overpressure of

the IV.

4.3 MiniCLEAN Detector in Cooling Phase

The construction of MiniCLEAN completed in June 2015 and the detector start

cooling down in early August. The cooling rate was initially 6K per day but this rate

gradually decreased. Below 140 K, the cooling rate decreased to less than 1 K per day.

We speculate that cooling rate deceased due to the decreased thermal conductivity of

argon gas at low temperature. We experienced a leak incident in April 2016 resulting

from over-bending the OV exhaust bellows while ﬁlling the water tank. Adjusting

the bellows required the opening of the OV vacuum. We expected that this operation

would warm up the temperature of IV by 20 K, but in fact the temperature rose by

over 100 K due due to an additional OV leak. In order to improve the cooling rate

we added an external condenser to our cryogenic system to drip liquid argon into

the IV in addition to cooling the gas. We were thereby able to obtain a much larger

cooling rate and the temperature of bottom of the IV reached liquefaction point of

Argon (∼ 87K) on the 3rd of December 2016. Figure 4.9 shows the changes in the

cooling curve before and after the condenser was added. A condenser is a supplement

cooling power designed to work with puriﬁcation system. The condenser consists of

two concentric cylinders of 3/8" steel with 1/2" plates closing both ends. The outer

cylinder vacuum space provides insulation of inner cylinder which holds the liquid

nitrogen. The puriﬁed argon gas enters the condenser and subsequently condensed

inside the inner cylinder then ﬂow into the IV through 1/2" stainless steel pipe. The

condenser is shown in Fig. 4.10

The condenser speed up the cooling process, however, it rely on the shipment of

LN2 dewar every week at SNOLAB. Therefore, the condenser running can not be

operated continuously. In the ﬁrst 6 hours, due to the long hose connect to the IV,

only cold gas reaches the IV. When the long hose cold enough, the liquid ﬂow into the

IV which increase the rate of cooling. Failing to continuously ﬁlling from condenser

causing the cooling process stalled.

A series of leak was found after the bottom of the IV reached liquefaction points.

The ﬁrst leak was found in the exhaust vent line causing the reduction of triplet

lifetime. In order to restore the purity of argon, a series of pump and purge cycle is

performed to pump out the impurity eﬃciently. Later, various leak is identiﬁed in the

condenser and the charcoal trap. Due to the pump and purge cycle and constantly

checking the leak, the time to operate condenser is limited. Thus the temperature of

denser (blue). The condenser only running for short period of time between 200 hr
and 350 hr, which eﬀective expedite the cooling process.

IV is kept at around 130 -140 K. As of August 1st, 2017, the average temperature

of IV is around 130 K. The comprehensive leak checking has performed on the all

sub-system of MiniCLEAN. No source of leak is found, the MiniCLEAN detector will

continue its cooling. In order to solve the problem of LN2 supply for condenser. A

plan to purchase a cryocooler with 500 W cooling power at LN2 temperature is made

to operate the condenser 24/7. This new equipment should improve the cooling and

ﬁlling rate. The estimated time to cool and ﬁll up the IV with LAr is around 52

days[103]. The detail description of the leak and the monitoring of triplet lifetime are

in Chapter 8 and 9

In-Situ Optical Calibration System

The MiniCLEAN detector utilizes 92 PMTs to collect liquid/gaseous argon scintilla-

tion light. Now a so-called Single PhotoElectron (SPE) calibration is important for

ensuring the PMTs’ stability, and in order to track PMT gain over time, an external,

stable source is required. Towards this, an LED light injection system was devel-

oped for this purpose. An LED is extremely stable over short time scale (∼minutes),

its intensity can be changed (through software), and it can reach a high repetition

rate (∼100 MHz). Therefore the LED serves as a stable, programable external light

source.

The system consist of 6 blue and 6 UV LEDs. Now at low intensity, the blue

LED can be used to determine the PMT gain; and, at high repetition rate, the PMT

stability gain be can tracked hourly. On the other hand, UV LEDs can not only help

check TPB stability, but also verify the integrity of the optical path of scintillation

light in the detector. The LED system will be described in this chapter and the In-

Situ optical calibration, in association with the preliminary LED data analysis, will

be described in the next chapter.

5.1 LEDs

The blue LEDs are of type ThorLabs LED 465E1. Their spectral intensity peaks at

465 nm as shown in Fig. 5.1. The VUV argon scintillation light is TPB shifted to the

blue end of visible spectrum, and as such the blue LED was a natural choice. The

PMTs used by MiniCLEAN are described in section 3, and the Fig. 3.2 shows the

spectral response characteristic indicating that the most sensitive region is indeed at

blue light range. This ensures that when performing the SPE calibration, the very

weak LED light will be detected with the highest possible collection eﬃciency.

The UV LEDs are from UVTOP 260 sensor electronic technology, inc., with peak

intensity at 260 nm as shown in Fig 5.2. The LEDs are mounted on the side of optical

cassettes and they are coupled to an optical ﬁber in order to inject the light into the

detector active volume, as shown in Fig. 5.3. Each LED is coupled to an optical ﬁber

with a standard SMA connector on one end and bare on the other. Both ﬁber ends

were polished to a ﬂat perpendicular surface by using the termination kit from Ocean

Optics. Fibers were tested to understand the characteristic, before making decision.

Figure 5.4 shows the angular distribution of each tested ﬁber.

Because of its large angular coverage, ﬁber was chosen. In the other words, the

LED photons can reach more PMTs, giving an advantage towards performing the

optical calibration. Ocean Optics SR 600 nm2 ﬁber was used with the UV LEDs,

because of its increased transmittance in the UV range. For the blue LEDs, ThorLabs

BFH48 600 nm3 was used because of its higher numerical aperture. Additionally, a

convex lens (ThorLabs LB11574) was placed between the ﬁber connection and the

blue LEDs in order to focus the light onto the face of the ﬁber at an angle larger than

the output angle of the LED.

5.2 Angular distribution of LEDs

In an attempt to increase the ﬁber emission light angular distribution, two modiﬁ-

cations were tested. The ﬁrst approach used an irregular ﬁber tip shape to increase

angular coverage, whereas the second directly coats the ﬁber tip with TPB in an

attempt to further diﬀuse light. Fig. 5.5 shows the experimental setup. PMT1 re-

ceived head-on photons from the ﬁber tip and was used to normalize the response

from PMT2. PMT2 was arranged such that diﬀerent angles (θ) could be attained.

Fibers No.1 had a smooth face, whereas No.2 had an irregular tip surface. After

one test, the two ﬁbers were then tip coated with TPB: No.1 coated with 100 mg, and

No.2 with 150 mg. Figure 5.6 shows the results from ﬁbers without TPB. The ﬁber

with an irregular tip (No.2) shape reaches 10% of intensity of PMT1 at around 17◦,

whereas the smooth-faced ﬁber (No. 1) has dropped to 2%. On the other hand, Fig.

5.7 shows the results with both ﬁbers TPB coated. With ﬁrst no TPB coating, both

ﬁbers reach the 10% level at the same angle. But with TPB coating a longer tail is

obtained. The results indicate a larger angular distribution, implying more PMTs

illuminated by LED photons, for the irregular ﬁber tip shape. Furthermore, with the

TPB-coated ﬁber tip, a longer tail after 20◦ is obtained; however, the contribution

from TPB is under 10%, which is not al large improvement. Figure 5.8, showing the

angular distribution of ﬁber No.2 (no TPB coating), indicates that TPB doesn’t make

a pronounced improvement before 20◦. It was noticed that TPB can ﬂake oﬀ the ﬁber

tip, therefore if the LED light yield is lower than normal then the ﬁber tip coating

integrity should be investigated. Because of these observations, the TPB coating idea

was discarded, but, because of the enhanced angular coverage, the irregular tips shape

was retained.

Figure 5.8: Results of ﬁber No. 2, red dot shows the result of ﬁber tip without TPB,
and green dot is the results of ﬁber tip with TPB(150 mg) coating.

Following these tests, a lens – for the blue LED – was added in order to improve

light collection eﬃciency to the ﬁber, and towards the same goal, a spacer was added

for the UV LED. The angular distribution of emitted light from optical ﬁber was

then measured for the LEDs. The emitted light was projected onto a thin screen

and a digital photograph was acquired. Light emitted from the ﬁber tip was then

projected onto a thin paper screen. For the UV LED, the thin paper screen worked as

a weak wavelength shifter, shifting invisible UV light into the blue end of the visible

spectrum. In order to minimize photon leakage, the whole operation was carried out

in a dark box. A 5 seconds default exposure time was used for the blue LED and the

brightness was carefully reduced to avoid saturation near the peak. The UV LED,

however, did not produce enough light to be visible to the naked eye, and so a longer

15 seconds exposure time was employed. A 10 seconds camera delay was used so that

CHAPTER 5.

IN-SITU OPTICAL CALIBRATION SYSTEM

74

after set up, the dark box could be closed without rush. Moreover, when the UV

LED was in place, the room light was turned oﬀ in order to further reduce leaking

photon into the dark box.

The 2848 x 2136 digital images were ﬁrst scaled to 1/2 their original pixel count, to

1424 X 1068. This resizing results in a local averaging that dampens extreme values,

thereby improving peak ﬁnding. Blue LED images were converted into gray-scale

whereas the UV LED images had their blue component, of the RGB valued image,

isolated and then converted to gray-scale. The peak ﬁnder locates the maximum

intensity and then checks values a few pixels around it. If these surrounding pixels

are less than 75% of the peak the point is considered extreme (unusable) and the

ﬁnder will then look for the next maximum value. The intensity is then sampled at

user-deﬁned distances from the peak location.

To examine procedure reproducibility, two data sets for the blue LEDs were ac-

quired. Figures 5.9 and 5.10 show example plots for blue- and UV-LED tests, respec-

tively. The upper left displays the image after gray-scale conversion. The red dot

represents the last peak found with the peak ﬁnder, and the green circle is the peak

location used in calculations. If the two did not over lay then the peak location was

inputted manually. The upper right is a 3D representation of the gray-scale image

(not normalized). The lower left plots each intensity sampled (normalized) as a func-

tion of distance, in pixels, from the peak. The lower right is the average intensity

(normalized) as a function of angular distance from the ﬁber axis, which is assumed

to coincide with the peak value. The data analysis was carried out using MatLab.

The ﬁnal results are summarized in Tab. 5.1.

The blue LED results show a crisp 3D representation, with the average intensity

error typically below 5%. Comparing the two sets of blue measurements in the above

table, it is clear that they are consistent with each other with diﬀerences typically

below 1 degree. The average angles for the intensities are consistent, suggesting

that the results are reproducible within the random error. Blue 22 shows a distinct

deformation near the peak, which is captured in both measurements sets. Blue 4, on

the other hand, shows a slight deformation at the peak that may be the remains of

the double peak that is seen without the use of a lens.

The UV results provide a general trend of the distribution but are subject to large

errors. The error in the UV results were typically 10-15%, with UV 1 and 3 having

larger errors – 15-20% and 20-30%, respectively – but UV 5 much less than 10-15%. In

an attempt to obtain clearer pictures and reduce the error UV 1 and 3 were repeated,

but the results were similar thus the previous measurements were retained. UV 5

is unusually crisp and narrow and was observed to be much brighter than the other

LEDs. Due to mechanical failures Blue spare and UV 6 were not installed in the ﬁnal

detector.

5.3 UNM LED pulser

The prompt component of argon scintillation light has very fast 6 ns decay time, thus

to best mimic this the LED pulses require a very high rate. The LED pulse driven by a

typical expensive, commercially-available pulser can achieve this goal. Alternatively,

Kapustinsky[104] oﬀer a low cost pulser consisting of two fast transistors. This pulser

is based on the fast discharge of a small capacitor via a complementary pair of RF

transistors. We modiﬁed the original circuit to better accommodate both Blue and

UV LEDs. The resulting UNM LED pulser consist of two parts, a ﬁeld-programmable

gate array (FPGA) and the driver circuit. The main circuit is shown in Fig. 5.11. The

FPGA sends a trigger pulse to the driver board through coaxial cables. The trigger

is a positive 3.5 V pulse that rides on the variable positive dc bias level, 0-24 V. The

dc component of the trigger charges a 100 pF capacitor. The complementary-pair

transistors are switched on by the trailing edge of the diﬀerentiated input pulse.

CHAPTER 5.

IN-SITU OPTICAL CALIBRATION SYSTEM

78

The subsequent circuit path to ground provide a low impedance path for the

capacitor to dump its charge through the LED. The 220 nH inductor in the circuit

develops charge in opposition to the discharging capacitor. This action reduces the

decay constant τ of the light pulse, which follows the time dependance e−t/τ . The 220

nH inductor shortens the time constant to approximately 6 ns. Figure 5.12 compares

the pulse shape driven by the UNM LED pulser and the normal pulser, and it is

clearly seen that the UNM LED pulser improve the pulse width by factor of 2-3 as

shown in Fig. 5.13. The output pulse width as a function of bias voltage (Vcc) is

also investigated, and no apparent relationship between these two – Fig. 5.14 – is

apparent.

5.4 LED LN2 dunk test

In order to understand the stability of the LEDs under cryogenic temperature, the

LN2 dunk test was performed. The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 5.15. Each

LED was assembled and coupled to optical ﬁber as described in previous sections.

The tip of the ﬁber coupled to the UV LED was coated with TPB to shift the UV

light to visible. In order to simulate the environment in the IV, a 20 cm cylindrical

acrylic was used to transmit the light to the PMT. Figure 5.16 shows the LED coupled

to the acrylic. An adaptor was installed on the bottom of the acrylic to couple to the

optical ﬁber. On the acrylic cylinder surface, a 1 cm groove was cut to accommodate

the twisted pair of LEDs due to the limit space of the dewar bottle neck. With this

design, the acrylic cylinder can fully insert into the dewar through the opening. A

3" PMT then couples to the top of acrylic cylinder in order to observe LED photons.

The whole system is positioned inside the dark box, and a black blanket was used to

cover the dewar to further improve the system.

A Tektronix TDS 3054C oscilloscope was used to record both the PMT signal

and the pulse driving the LED. Data was then extracted from the oscilloscope –

and converted to text format – using NI Express, after which ROOT analysis was

performed. Every LED was submerged in LN2 for an intended 24 hours (light yield is

collected by the PMT), but due to some accidental connection problems the immersion

times of collected data is somewhat variable. Nonetheless, each LED was continuously

pulsed for at least 7 hours, giving ample opportunity to determine LED stability.

The raw waveform of each event during the test was read and the ﬁrst 800 samples

determined the baseline. Subsequently, the baseline was subtracted from the raw

waveform and the integrated charge was calculated. The average integrated charge

was obtained hourly and then plotted as a function of time. The relative stability

was deﬁned as the standard deviation of integrated charge in a hour, divided by the

average integrated charge. This was used to track the hourly LED variation.

Figure 5.17 and 5.18 shows the average integrated charge as a function of time

for the blue- and UV-LED, respectively. Because every LED had a diﬀerent response

to the same voltage, the average integrated charge of each was in turn rather diﬀer-

ent. The current is proportional to the light yield but exponentially proportional to

the voltage, therefore a slight voltage change can cause a signiﬁcant current change.

CHAPTER 5.

IN-SITU OPTICAL CALIBRATION SYSTEM

82

However, the relative stability over the course of a test is of most interest, not the

light yield. Figure 5.19 shows the relative stability of blue- and UV-LED, respectively.

The measured intensity drift is under 3% for blue the LED and 10% for UV LED.

Drift causes include the LED power supply, PMT high voltage supply, PMT gain

variation, and so on. Moreover, the LN2 level in the dewar changed throughout the

test and the resulting temperature changes could aﬀect the optical properties inside

the dewar, which in turn aﬀected the collection eﬃciency of LED photons. As for

the UV LED test, any larger variation might be due to the additional TPB coating,

which may ﬂake oﬀ during the test. The detailed estimation of uncertainties can

not be obtained. The tests proved that both LED types were functioning well under

cryogenic temperature. For the In-Situ optical calibration, the LEDs were typically

turned on for just tens of minutes, and a huge response variation was not expected

in the daily calibration process.

5.5 Preliminary PMT Gain calibration

The Single Photo Electron (SPE) calibration runs with low intensity LED pulses and

1.7-2 kV PMT voltages, were performed at room temperature. The data acquisition

system was the same as the dunk test. The digital oscilloscope read the PMT voltages

at 0.2 ns intervals, each digitization giving a charge of qi. The baseline and the noise

σn were measured for each run, and a Gaussian ﬁt to the central noise peak in the

qi distribution was performed. A simple pulse ﬁnding algorithm was used to scan

each scope trigger for three sequential (baseline subtracted) voltages greater than

3σn, summing the pulse charge q = Σqi until qi falls below σn. The "noise" – taken as

an average over a random 200-ns long window normalized to the pulse length – was

subtracted on an event-by-event basis, shifting the charge gain by 11% at 1.7 kV.

The SPE charge distribution is ﬁtted to a exponential plus Polya distribution with

of the electron charge in pC. The exponential part of ﬁtting function is :

(5.3)

where bw is the histogram bin width, f is the signal fraction, and N is the total

number of events. Figure 5.20 shows the example of the ﬁt and Fig. 5.21 shows the

ﬁt results as a function of PMT operating voltage. The latter plot ﬁt well to the

power law (see ﬁgure) indicating the gain varies with HV voltage exponentially.

5.6 Installation of LED light injection system

In the SNOLAB underground laboratory, all parts – LEDs, ﬁbers, etc. – were ul-

trasonically cleaned, thoroughly. Subsequently, other components were hand cleaned

with methanol, whereas the LEDs and ﬁbers were cleaned with ultra pure water to

remove any residual containment. The LEDs were then assembled and mounted onto

the optical cassettes (Fig. 5.22). The LED pulser box output channel connected to

extend far back to couple to the LED. The operational scheme is shown in Fig. 5.24,

LED Data Analysis

The Single Photo Electron (SPE) calibration is important to the overall light detec-

tion experiment, the energy resolution of which depends on an understanding of the

PMT response to a single photon. The In-Situ optical calibration provided a way

to track the PMT gain hour by hour. Therefore the LED light injection system can

improve the energy resolution. In this chapter a detailed description of data analysis

from the In-Situ optical calibration and the detector properties investigated by LED

data, are presented.

6.1 Preliminary test

The LED light injection system was tested to conﬁrm its functionality. Before the

construction completion of the IV, the integration of the LED hardware was completed

and the MiniCLEAN DAQ system was tested. During regular operation, the slow

control system was responsible for remotely monitoring and controlling the hardware.

The interface of the slow control is shown in Fig. 6.1. The slow control system could

manipulate the LED system in two ways: trigger any one LED with a desired voltage,

or cycling the light injection.

For preliminary testing/debugging it would be convenient to pulse one LED at

the time, but for the In-Situ optical calibration, however, continuous pulsing through

every LED is desired.

Indeed the “LED_auto_trigger” in Fig. 6.1 provided this

functionality for a daily calibration. It ﬁred both LED types, blue for 15 minutes

then UV for 15 minutes alternatively. Through hard-coding, each individual bias

voltage pulsed each individual LED one by one, in order to obtain their optimal light

emission values. This gave good statistics towards tracking – hourly – the PMT or

TPB stability. The LED location map is shown in Fig. 6.2. Figure 6.3 shows the

properties such as total charge (Q), charge ratio (QR), Fprompt (Fp) and the centroid

reconstructed radius (R) are plotted as an aid towards helping check the integrity of

both the detector and the data analysis. Figure 6.4 shows the 2-D plots of various

parameters. With low intensity LED emission the total charge from the LED events

were usually lower than 50 PE, and the ﬂuctuation depends on the optical properties

in the detector such as ESR foil reﬂectivity and the UV-to-visible conversion eﬃciency

of the TPB coating. Light emitted from an LED should only be prompt light, making

Fprompt equal to unity. However, due to both after-pulsing (see section 6.4.1) in the

late light region and random electronic noise, the Fprompt distribution is broadened;

also, QR and the centroid reconstruction are aﬀected thereby causing some deviation

from expectations.

6.2 Single Photon Counting

For low intensity, the distribution of the number of photons emitted by an LED

follows the Poisson distribution, changing to the Gaussian distribution for higher

intensities, as implied by the central limit theorem. To check that the PMTs are,

to high likelihood, indeed seeing only single photons from a low intensity LED, the

Poisson Distribution was used to determine the speciﬁc probability of the photon

being received by each PMT. The Poisson distribution :

P (n; µ) =

µn · e−µ
n!

(6.1)

where µ is the mean number of photoelectrons observed by the PMT and P (n; µ) is

the probability that n photoelectrons are detected. That is, occupancy rate for each

PMT when the mean is µ. For the In-Situ optical calibration, the required probability

of observing multiple photons is set to <2.5%.

(6.2)

CHAPTER 6. LED DATA ANALYSIS

94

Eq. 6.2 prescribes the occupancy rate at 5 %, to meet the requirement. Note that the

dark hits – thermionic emission from photocathode – could contribute to the LED

charge distribution. Now the probability of getting no photons (dark hits) can be

expressed:

P (0) =

Nnoise
Ntrig

= e−µ

(6.3)

where Nnoise is the number of events in the pedestal – mostly from dark hits – and Ntrig

is the number of LED triggers. For PMTs operating at LAr cryogenic temperature

the dark hit rate is around 600 Hz, which is greatly reduced due to less thermionic

motion at photocathode. From [105], the random coincidence rates of LED can be

expressed :

frandom = fdark · ftrig · τwindow

(6.4)

where frandom is the random coincidence rate, fdark is the dark hits rate, and τwindow

is the acquisition window of LED events. Furthermore, for small µ the events rate is

(using Eq. 6.3)

fevents = (1 − P (0))ftrig (cid:39) µftrig

(6.5)

where the fevents is the event rate of LED events. Thus, for the random coincidences’

contribution at the level of 1%, it is necessary to keep

µ ≥

fdark · τwindow
0.01

(6.6)

For a 600 Hz dark hits rate and τwindow = 100 ns, Eq. 6.6 gives µ ≥ 0.006. Therefore,

for µ = 0.05 the LED charge distribution has both negligible contribution from dark

CHAPTER 6. LED DATA ANALYSIS

hits and multiple photoelectrons. Figure 6.5 shows the typical occupancy rate of each

PMT while doing the optical calibration. Most PMT received a single photon with

the probability less than 5% except three PMTs which are at direct opposite of LED.

The LED are mounted uniformly throughout the sphere, thus these PMTs received

more than 5% of single photon will have less than 5% while some other LEDs are

ﬁring. While occupancy rate ensure the PMT sees single photon, the timing of the

pulse from LED can further ensure the PMT are seeing the photon from LED instead

of random noise. Figure 6.6 shows the timing of pulse from LED in diﬀerent relative

position to the LED. For every trigger from LED, the timing of the pulse in diﬀerent

position are consistent with each other.

CLEAN collaboration[106] – exhibits multiple timing components each of which are

performed before the waveform was recorded. The ﬁtting procedure cycles through

the charge distribution of all 92 PMTs, thus the gain of each PMT channel can be

determined, as shown in Fig. 6.9. The PMT gains are determined approximately

every 5 minutes, depending on the charge distribution statistics. Therefore the PMT

gain relative stability can be deﬁned as the standard deviation of the gain in the given

period of time divided by the average gain in the given time. Figure 6.10 shows the

PMT gain relative stability for each PMT over the course of approximately a 7-hour

data acquisition period, indicating that the PMTs’ gain variation over 7 hours is less

than 2.5%.

The angular distribution of LED events can be helpful towards determining if

the LED worked as expect and allowing a check of the detector optics, from the UV

LED. Figure 6.11 shows the intensity of PMTs as a function of the angle between each

PMT and the ﬁring LED. For most LEDs, the highest intensity appears at 2.7 Rad

because the LEDs were in fact mounted on the side of the cassettes, and therefore

not aimed directly to the opposite PMT (∼3.14 Rad.). Notice that LED 61 (blue)

has highest intensity at a 0.3 Rad angle. This is because when the cassette of PMT

61 was adjusted the baﬄe became tilted by accident such that the ﬁber is blocked (by

the baﬄe) instead of poking through it. Therefore the photons emitted by LED 61

were mostly reﬂected to PMT 66 which is near PMT 61, thus resulting in the strange

angular distribution. Nonetheless, for the sake of doing SPE calibration, by increasing

the current through the LED, the rest of PMTs still be able to received enough

photons. Therefore no further adjustment was performed in order to minimized the

time of exposing the IV to the environment which is at risk to increase the radon

level of the IV. On the other hand, the UV LED 62 seems not emitting any photons.

After increasing the voltage to the maximum allowed voltage of LED pulser, very weak

intensity still observed. The phenomenon was seen for all LEDs that the LED required

more bias voltage to drive the LED at the same current with the test results obtained

at UNM. This is due to the fact that to reproduce the exact the same environment at

UNM is impossible, thus the full setup of IV could introduce unexpected impedance to

the LED pulser system. Nevertheless most LEDs still functioning well by increasing

the bias voltage by 1 or 2 V except the UV LED 62.

Before moving the IV into the OV (with full shielding from water tank), it was

sitting in the clean room without any further shielding. Gamma rays, which are

induced by the interaction between cosmic rays and underground rock, forms the

major background source. Such gamma photons passing through the acrylic creates

Cherenkov light, which is detected by the PMTs. This Cherenkov light – which is

blue and produces a very fast pulse in the PMT – is suitable in helping to determine

the PMT gain, or rather it is a method to help check the LED results.

In this

regard, Figure 6.12 shows a comparison of SPE charge distribution between LED and

Cherenkov light methods.

Notice that for Fig. 6.12(b) there is a diﬀerence in the low charge part of the

distribution, and several sources are reasons attributed to this diﬀerence. Although

each PMT uses the same model there are in reality some slightly diﬀerence in light

collection eﬃciency. The “shoulder” in the low charge might results from the under-

ampliﬁed photoelectrons. For Cherenkov light, the incident photons in a PMT could

have large angles and might skip the ﬁrst dynode, resulting in under-ampliﬁed pho-

toelectrons. Nonetheless, the PMT gain determined by the LED and Cherenkov

methods are in good agreement, as shown in Fig. 6.13.

The stability of the TPB coating can be determined by comparing the SPE cal-

ibrations (appropriately scaled) from blue and UV LEDs; for instance, Figure 6.14

shows gains determined from blue and UV LED where diﬀerences are attributed to

TPB eﬃciencies. The TPB relative stability can be determined by comparing two

measurements and is deﬁned as the diﬀerences between two measurements in the

given PMT, divided by the mean charge over the course of measurement determined

by the UV LED.

A typical result is shown in Fig. 6.15. The large change in relative stability

indicates that there might be some other factors aﬀecting the measurement. For

example, the behavior of blue photons bouncing oﬀ the TPB surface might be very

diﬀerent from the UV-to-visible TPB reemission photons. Moreover, the study from

[107] indicates that the UV photon can be shifted by the baﬄe (ESR foil, Fig. 6.16)

resulting in the systematic error on PMT gain measurement using UV LED.

from blue LED and red dot is from UV LEDs.

6.4 Pulse Timing Analysis

The LED is a stable external light source which can be used to understand the pulse

timing for diﬀerent pulse types: pre-pulsing, prompt-pulsing, double pulsing, late

pulsing and after pulsing. These pulse types could aﬀect the Fprompt and energy

CHAPTER 6. LED DATA ANALYSIS

104

resolution, thus a thorough study is needed in order to understand the fraction of

these pulses appearing in the data. The deﬁnition and explanation of each pulse type

follows :

• Pre-pulsing : The incident photon did not convert to a photoelectron at the

photocathode, but instead passes through the photocathode and hits the ﬁrst

dynode, create photoelectrons there. This type of pulse usually arrives earlier

than the prompt-pulsing (conversion to photoelectrons at photocathode). The

timing is around 30 ns earlier than prompt-pulsing which is equivalent to the

electron transit time of the PMT (Fig. 6.17(a)).

• Prompt-pulsing : The incident photon converts to a photoelectron at the

photocathode and follows the series of dynode multiplications. The trigger

time is deﬁned as timing of the peak of summed pulses (Fig. 6.17(a)).

• Double-pulsing : The incident photon converts to photoelectrons at the pho-

tocathode with subsequent inelastic scattering oﬀ the ﬁrst dynode. This causes

some photoelectrons to scatter backward and create the current at anode at

a later time. The charge of individual pulses is smaller than the pulse from

prompt-pulsing, but the total charge of the pulses is equal to the prompt-pulsing

(Fig. 6.17(b)).

• Late-pulsing : The incident photon converts to photoelectrons at the photo-

cathode and subsequently elastically scatters oﬀ the ﬁrst dynode. The charge

of the pulse is the same with the pulse from prompt-pulsing, but arrives later in

time. The timing diﬀerence between this type of pulse and the prompt-pulsing

is approximately twice the electron transit time of the PMT (Fig. 6.17(c)).

• After-pulsing : The photoelectron could have some possibility to ionize the

residual gases inside the PMT. The resulting positive ion drift back to the

CHAPTER 6. LED DATA ANALYSIS

105

photocathode, creating a cascade of photoelectrons going through the normal

dynode chain. The timing of this type of pulse depends on the type of ion (Fig.

6.17(d)).

Figure 6.18: Pulse timing for diﬀerent type of pulse.

Using the LED pulse as reference pulse (prompt-pulsing), the fraction of each type

of pulse can be determined. Figure 6.19 shows the rate of each type of pulse found

in the data for each PMT. Among these diﬀerent type of pulses, the pre-pulsing has

lowest rate due to high conversion rate at photocathode. The double-pulsing also

has low rate because if the photoelectron inelastic scattered from ﬁrst dynode not

far away depends on the kinetic energy it carried, therefore the pulse would be very

close with the prior pulse, the pulse ﬁnding algorithm may not be able to distinguish

it as double pulse. On the other hand, with elastic scattering, the photoelectrons

usually have larger kinetic energy which can travel in the opposite direction until

it lose the kinetic energy and drift back to the ﬁrst dynode. Therefore the timing

is approximately twice of the electron transit time of the PMT. These three type

of pulse, however, are well inside the prompt window and is coming from the real

scintillation events. Therefore it will not aﬀect the total charge and the Fprompt

analysis. Conversely, the after-pulsing is from the interaction of residual gas and the

photoelectrons, this additional pulse and charge will aﬀect the energy resolution and

the Fprompt analysis. Therefore more carefully treatment is needed to understand

the impact of the after-pulsing.

6.4.1 After-Pulsing

The timing of the after-pulsing depends on the type of ion and the supply voltage

of PMT ( the voltage between ﬁrst dynode and the photocathode). Figure 6.20

shows the dimensionality of R5912-02MOD. The radius (0.131 m) is taken to be

the distance between photocathode and the ﬁrst dynode. The supply voltage (320

V) is determined by average the high voltage of 92 PMTs and calculate the voltage

according to the voltage distribution ratio in the speciﬁcation of PMT. If assuming

the electric potential distribution between the ﬁrst dynode and the photocathode is

quadratic[108] :

V (s) = V0 · (1 −

)2

(6.10)

where s is the position inside the PMT, V(s) is the potential at s, V0 is the potential

of origin and L is the distance between the ﬁrst dynode and photocathode. Using the

Eq. 6.10, the delayed time of after-pulsing is :

Using the LED data taken with IV at room temperature, the peak from individual

noise as shown in Fig. 6.22. This one dimension plot is ﬁtted with three gaussian

distributions to identify the peak position and the σ of the peak. The 6 PE charge

cut is added after a abnormal background was found. A peak was found at pulse time

around 200 ns. However, according to the Eq. 6.11, no ion can have such fast delayed

time. After thorough study, it was found that this is due to the impedance mismatch

along the LED coaxial cable as shown in Fig. 6.23. LED pulser is connected to a 60

is 1.5 ns results in 180

ns delay time for reﬂection signal to trigger the LED again. In addition, three peak

are clear to be seen in the projection plot, the peak time is 1400 ns, 3157 ns and

7335 ns respectively. Compare this value to Table 6.1, the ﬁrst peak is from the H +,

second peak from the He+ and third peak is from the N +

2 . The calculated delayed

time is slightly larger than the ﬁtted time. Possible systematic error could include

the larger χ2 which indicates the ﬁt is less accurate. Moreover, the constructing

model of the voltage distribution in the PMT might be over simpliﬁed. In addition,

the peak at 600 ns was found to have negligible contribution. This peak may due

to the residual gas was ionized by photoelectron between the dynodes, thus faster

delayed time was observed. The MiniCLEAN PMT is designed to be operated under

cryogenic temperature. Therefore, the intensity of the peak and the rate of after-

pulsing is expected to be lower under the cryogenic temperature due to some residual

gas freezing onto the inner surface of PMT (e.g. CO2, O2, etc.).

It has been found that the TPB response function to scintillation light has more

complex structure with a delayed component(Segreto [109]). The functional form of

where N and A are constants depending on the nature of the scintillator, ta is a relax-

ation time that is linked to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of triplet states in the scintillator,

ηs is the ﬂuorescence yield.

In the LED data, the summed waveform of blue and UV LED exhibit diﬀerent

shapes as shown in Fig. 6.24. This shows that the UV LED has extra component after

the prompt peak. The UV photons are shifted by the TPB while it is transparent for

the blue photons. Therefore, using the UV LED, the characteristic timing structure

of TPB ﬂuorescence can be determined by UV LED. To exclude any electronic eﬀect,

the pulse-time distribution of blue LED is ﬁtted with gaussian distribution plus a

exponential as shown in Fig. 6.25. This shows no sign of extra components other

than the exponential decay which exclude the possibility that any decay components

in UV LED comes from electronic eﬀect. The pulse-time distribution of UV LED is

then ﬁtted to Eq. 6.12 with the prompt peak ﬁtted to a gaussian distribution as shown

in Fig. 6.26. The results shows the delayed light is about 5% of the peak light. The

surface alpha induced TPB scintillation(see 7.1 ) in the vacuum can be used to cross

check the results from UV LED. Figure 6.27 shows the ﬁtting results using Eq. 6.12 of

the summed waveform from UV LED and alpha-TPB scintillation. The ﬁtting results

seems agree with each other although the χ2/ndf seems too small which is because

the wrong error bar is assigned to each bins. The parameter A (0.225) is in agreement

with the results from Segreto(0.22), but the ta (11 ns) which is the relaxation time of

the triplet states in the scintillator is almost factor of 5 smaller than the results from

Segreto(50 ns). Moreover, the contribution of TPB-delayed light determined by UV

LED is about 5% which is also lower than Segreto’s result (40%). However, rather

than using quenched scintillation light which used by Segreto, the UV LED provide

more direct source to measure the TPB-delayed light and has less systematic errors.

6.5 LED in Cold Gas

The MiniCLEAN detector reaches 120 K in Oct. 2016. The preliminary data taking

was performed to check the status of each detector components. The detail description

of MiniCLEAN cold gas run will be described in Chapter 8. The LEDs were turned

on to test the functionality. Unfortunately, from the connectivity test, only three

LEDs has measured the reasonable impedance. All LEDs are still turned on to see

if the pulse is seen in the data. However, no LED pulse is seen in the data. Figure

6.28 shows the reconstruction position from centroid ﬁt in cold gas and compare with

the results from simulation. The reconstructed LED events should concentrate at the

opposite position of LED. Instead in the cold gas data, the reconstructed position

is deviated from where it should be. Moreover, Fig. 6.29 shows the normalized

counts as a function of reconstructed radius normalized to the TPB radius which is

the maximum radius of active volume and compare with the results from previous

vacuum data. The expected curve should concentrate at maximum radius of active

volume, in vacuum data, due to some photons bounce oﬀ TPB surface or the baﬄes,

CHAPTER 6. LED DATA ANALYSIS

115

broaden the peak. However, the results from cold gas seems more ﬂat throughout the

active volume, this indicates some sort of random noise was triggered over the LED

events.

Looking into the individual waveform, the triggered pulse is shown in Fig. 6.30.

This shows that no physical photons were seen by PMT at trigger time which con-

ﬁrmed the results from connectivity test. Plotting the events as function of the angle

between the LED and PMT, the ﬂat distribution were seen for LED events in cold

gas as shown in Fig. 6.31. For LED events in vacuum data, a clear peak was seen

at angle close to 0 degrees which indicates the direct opposite PMT received most of

the LED photons. Possible reason for losing the connection with LEDs may be due

to the incident which happened while cooling the detector. The incident causing the

detector warm up more than 120 K in couple hours and might results in the loosen

connector. The LED based In-situ optical calibration might not be available after

the commissioning of the detector, but the other method using the late scintillation

light can be used to determine the PMT gain on daily basis. The method will be

described in Chapter 8.

Vacuum Background Study

Minimizing the eﬀects from background events is important for WIMPs search and

demonstration of the PSD rejection ability. For background events which can fake the

WIMP’s signal the discrimination method is needed. Gamma and beta particles can

create the indistinguishable signal of electron recoil and aﬀect the energy resolution

determined by 39Ar energy spectrum ﬁtting. Therefore, it is important to understand

the origin of the background such that it can be either eliminate from the data or

quantiﬁed to be include in the data analysis. The detail of background events of

MiniCLEAN has been discussed in [102]. In this chapter, the strategy to eliminate

the background events in the MiniCLEAN’s preliminary vacuum data is discussed in

detail.

7.1 Surface alpha

The vacuum “Golden run” was taken after the ﬁne tuning of the system to test the

functionality of each system and before moving into OV. This data run was taken

while IV is under the vacuum. The major backgrounds are from the external gamma

which is the product of cosmic muons interact with the underground rock. In addition,

the radon daughter deposit on the TPB release the alpha particle in the process to

decay to more stable elements. Table 7.1 summarize the source and the estimated

surviving rate after the cuts in LAr of the γ/α particles.

The radon daughter plate out onto the TPB surface during TPB-deposition,

acrylic polishing or detector assembly creates alpha decay in the detector volume.

Depending on the location that the radon daughter plated out, will have diﬀerent

contribution to the background. Figure. 7.1 shows a cartoon describes the decay

route of alpha particle at diﬀerent locations. When alpha particle interact with the

TPB, the scintillation is emitted as the results of the α-TPB interaction[112]. Figure

7.2 shows the decay-chain of radon, the major source of the surface alpha comes from

210P o →206 P b + α(5.33M eV )

(7.1)

As indicated by Fig. 7.1, this process can either inject the alpha particle into the

acrylic and nucleus of polonium to the argon volume or vise versa. In vacuum data,

the only interaction can be observed is when alpha particle pass through the TPB

and producing the scintillation light. The surface alpha and the nucleus of polonium

interact with argon gas will be described in Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 7. VACUUM BACKGROUND STUDY

121

The alpha-TPB interaction takes place in front of the PMT, thus ideally one

PMT will get the major fraction of the charge of the event. However, the scintillation

light could be shifted further by TPB and re-emitted isotropically. Thus the charge

ratio is not expected to be high. Moreover, the characteristic decay time (∼ 280 ns

at room temperature and ∼ 800 ns at LAr temperature[113]) push the Fprompt to

lower region. Figure 7.4 shows the Fprompt-charge scatter plot, notice that the band

at around fp ∼ 0.4 extend to high energy is from the alpha-TPB scintillation.

Figure 7.3: Alpha-TPB scintillation events in CLEANViewer.

To determine the rate of alpha-TPB interaction a cut need to be made to select

the events. Projecting the Fig. 7.4 to Y(Fprompt) axis and ﬁtted with Gaussian, the

mean and σ is obtained. The cut is deﬁned as fp = mean ± 5σ and charge > 100 PE.

The expected rate of alpha-TPB interaction from Table 7.1 is 6.8 event/hour which

is consistent with the results from vacuum data (6.86 ± 2.80 events/hour with ∼ 55

hours of live data) . This indicates that the MiniCLEAN detector did not introduce

unexpected radon daughters into the IV.

is from alpha-TPB scintillation.

7.2 Cherenkov Light in Acrylic

When the charged particle travel in the medium with speed faster than the speed

of light in the medium, the electromagnetic waves might be created which is called

Cherenkov radiation.

In MiniCLEAN detector, when the gamma particle moving

through the acrylic the electrons will be produced through the Compton scattering.

The acrylic is polarized by the electromagnetic ﬁled of the moving electrons. The

Cherenkov light is emitted whenever the velocity of the moving electrons exceeds the

speed of light in the medium or :

β · n > 1

(7.2)

where n is the refractive index of acrylic (∼ 1.49) and β is the ratio of the velocity of

electrons to that of light in the vacuum. As indicated by Eq. 7.2, there is a minimum

required velocity of electrons to produce the Cherenkov light. In terms of energy of

CHAPTER 7. VACUUM BACKGROUND STUDY

(7.3)

where m0c2 is the electron rest-mass energy (0.511 MeV). Figure 7.5 (a) plots the

threshold energy of electron and the minimum energy of gamma which can produce

the Compton electrons as a function of refractive index. The time takes the electrons

to slow from its initial velocity to below the threshold velocity is very short, typically

of the order of picoseconds. Therefore the Fprompt of Cherenkov events should be

near 1 (some electric noise and after-pulsing increases the late charge) as shown in Fig.

7.6. The photon yield from Cherenkov radiation is low therefore in the MiniCLEAN

vacuum data, it can be used to do the SPE calibration (see 6.3). The calculated yield

of Cherenkov photons in the 300 to 600 nm wavelength region is shown in Fig.7.5

(b). Consider the detector eﬃciency, each PMT mostly received single photon from

Cherenkov events. Moreover, the scintillation light from LAr is emitted isotropically,

for Cherenkov photons, however, are emitted preferentially along the direction of the

electron velocity. Figure 7.7 shows the direction of Cherenkov photons relative to the

direction of moving electrons.

Several cut can be made to eliminate the Cherenkov events from the data. A

Monte Carlo simulation of WIMPs events (3 M) in the MiniCLEN detector is carried

out to understand the cut eﬃciency. The ﬁrst cut is the charge cut, from previous

discussion the light yield of Cherenkov events is low and the detector threshold is

75 PE assuming the target light yield (6 PE/keV) is achieved with MiniCLEAN

detector. The second cut is from the Fprompt parameters, the WIMPs-nuclear recoil

produce the Fprompt centered at 0.7, while for Cherenkov events the Fprompt is

near 1 due to the very fast light emission. The third cut is from the charge ratio, the

Cherenkov events usually produced inside the acrylic thus the PMT which just behind

the acrylic will received most of the photons. On the other hand, the scintillation

events are created inside the active volume and emitted light isotropically. Moreover,

the TPB re-emission is also isotropic in both forward and backward direction. Thus

no one PMT should get large fraction of the scintillation light. The fourth has been

deﬁned is the polarization of Cherenkov light. As mentioned in the last paragraph,

the Cherenkov light has preferential direction in contrast of scintillation light. The

concept from moment of inertia of classic dynamics can be used to calculate the

spreads of the light of the Cherenkov events. Assuming the position vector of PMT

is

ri = xii + yij + zik

(7.4)

The charge (Qi where i is the i-th PMT) of each PMT received in the Cherenkov

event is known, the moment of inertia can be written as

(7.8)

Solving the above equations, the moment of inertia for both Cherenkov events and

WIMPs-nuclei recoil events can be obtained with respect to x, y and z. Figure

7.8 shows the moment of inertia of x, y and z for both type of events. As can be

seen in this plot, the moment of inertia of WIMPs-nuclei recoil are around 0.6 to

0.8, which means the light is emitted isotropically and no preferential direction was

found. On the other hand, the moment of inertia of Cherenkov events exhibit the

expected behavior. For x and y direction, the moment of inertia is large but for z

direction, the moment of inertia is small. This shows the Cherenkov events emit the

photons in the preferential direction and the shape looks like the “pen” such that one

direction has smaller moment of inertia. The last cut is the ﬁducial radius cut. The

ﬁducial volume determined from Monte Carlo simulation indicates within radius of

295 mm, the volume is free of backgrounds. Figure 7.9 shows the plots of charge

distribution, Fprompt distribution and charge ratio distribution of both Cherenkov

events and WIMP-nuclei recoil events. The cut eﬃciency at various stage of the cut

process is summarized in Table 7.2

Prior to ﬁll water in water tank (full shielding), the background rate drops due

to the partial shielding. Table 7.3 summarize the background rejection eﬃciency at

diﬀerent stage of status of IV ( before and after PMT gain matching1, and IV moved

into OV). After IV moving into OV (partial shielding), the background rejection

eﬃciency rose due to the decreasing background from external gamma particles. The

estimated background rate after IV moved into OV is 2.36 events/hour.

In summary, the expected Cherenkov event rate of MiniCLEAN detector is 9.7 ±

0.6 events/hour in the vacuum data without any shielding. After the full shielding

of IV is in place, the event rate decreased from 400 Hz to 17 Hz. While IV under

vacuum without any shielding, the main source that produce the Cherenkov events is

from rock gamma and internal gamma emitter. With full shielding the only dominant

source of gamma is from the internal gamma emitter. Thus the expected Cherenkov

rate should decrease by the factor of 110 (39Ar is a beta emitter which account for 2

Hz of trigger rate, see Chapter 8). Therefore the expected Cherenkov event rate with

full shielding is 0.364 ± 0.023 events/hour.

7.3 Foil scintillation

In the vacuum data, a type of unexpected events was found. There are excessive

events near the edge of the detector in the reconstructed radius distribution as shown

in Fig. 7.10. In the vacuum data, these events can be seen by plotting the charge

ratio as a function of reconstructed radius and project to the radius axis as shown

in Fig. 7.11. Noticed that if apply a charge cut (QR < 0.8) and compare to the

result without any cut, a clear peak at near the TPB radius is shown in the ﬁgure.

This peak in the data conﬁrmed that the results from simulation in Fig. 7.10. The

origin of these ESR foil scintillation could be from high energy events (alpha, beta

and gamma) bombard on the ESR foil and create the scintillation[115]. The ESR

foil which mentioned in Chapter 3 was used to be the liner of the optical cassettes to

increase the reﬂectivity inside it and to cover the gap between the optical cassettes

as well. Therefore the gamma ray from the detector material, the alpha particle from

the decay chain of radon daughter and the external high energy gamma ray are the

major sources of the ESR foil scintillation.

Figure 7.10: The reconstructed radius distribution. The black curve is from the MC
simulation and the blue color ﬁlled region is from the ESR foil scintillation[102].

In order to eliminate the foil scintillation events from the data, the detail properties

of the events needs to be understood. Figure 7.12 shows the scatter plot of charge and

Fprompt distribution in the vacuum data. It is clear to see there are four diﬀerent

group of events in this plot. The group of events at high Fprompt and high charge

ratio region is mainly from the Cherenkov events which has been carefully treated in

the last section. The group of events at low Fprompt and low charge ratio is from

the surface alpha-TPB scintillation which is described in detail in section 7.1. The

events around the low Fprompt and low charge ratio is from the instrument eﬀect

which will be described in detail in the next section. The events around high Fprompt

and low charge ratio is possibly from the ESR foil scintillation. A study from DEAP

collaboration[116] found that the scintillation has four characteristic decay time as

shown in Fig. 7.13. The 241AM source which can emit the alpha particle at energy ∼

5.4 MeV is placed before the ESR foil to induce the scintillation light. This conﬁrmed

what has been seen in the Fig. 7.12, due to the longer decay component , the Fprompt

is pushed to the lower Fprompt region.

7.12, the scintillation timing structure can be ﬁtted with three exponential functions

convoluted with Gaussian response function :

F (t) = A · e− t

where the A, B are the fraction of the components and τi, µi, σi are the decay time

, mean, σ of the Gaussian distribution for i-th component. The ﬁtting results is

summarized in the Table 7.4 along with the results from DEAP collaboration. The

ﬁtting example is shown in Fig. 7.14. The ﬁrst two time constants are roughly agree

with DEAP’s result, due to the constrain on data acquisition window in MiniCLEAN

(16 µs), the fourth time constant can not be measured. Therefore, the third time

constant measured by MiniCELAN could be the combination of the third and fourth

time constant, results in deviation from DEAP’s result.

events. The result is shown in Fig. 7.16. For events passed the ﬁducial volume cut

7.4 Miscellaneous events

In Fig. 7.12, the group of events at high charge ratio and low Fprompt are produced

from instrument eﬀects. Moreover, a “arm” structure can be seen in the charge-

Fprompt scatter plot as shown in Fig. 7.18. After the thorough study, PMT 41

seems to have signiﬁcant amount of events in that area and responsible for the “arm”

structure. Figure 7.19 shows the diﬀerent charg-Fprompt scatter plot with diﬀerent

events are removed. Figure 7.19 (a) shows the result with no cut, Fig. 7.19(b) shows

the result with ESR-foil events are removed, Fig. 7.19 (c) shows the results excluded

the PMT 41 and the results from PMT 41 is shown in Fig. 7.19 (d). It is clear to see

CHAPTER 7. VACUUM BACKGROUND STUDY

134

that the arm stucture is mainly from PMT 41. In vacuum data, the events of high

energy and low Fprompt is mostly from alpha-TPB scintillation, thus these events

from PMT 41 can not be physical events unless some unknown source is contributing

only to PMT 41.

It becomes more clear by seeing the maximum charge of the pulses as a function

of total charge of the event as shown in Fig. 7.20. Typically, the maximum charge

is linearly corresponds to the total charge. However, for PMT 41, the distribution is

relatively ﬂat compare to the rest of events. This indicates some artiﬁcial eﬀects are

responsible for this behavior. Moreover, Fig. 7.21 shows the maximum charge of the

pulses vs time. It was found that for PMT 41, a signiﬁcant portion of the maximum

charge comes in later in time (∼ 600 ns). At ﬁrst glance, these pulses seems from the

after-pulsing. However, from the discussion in Chapter 6.4.1, there are no source for

the after-pulsing to be happened in such short delayed time. In addition, these pulses

are not seen by the rest of PMTs, thus the origin of the pulses might not be from any

physical events of IV. Another piece of evidence shows that the PMT 41 is behaving

very diﬀerent from the rest of PMTs is from the proﬁle plot of Fig. 7.18 as shown in

Fig. 7.22. The proﬁle plot shows the mean value and associated error for charge (Y)

and Fprompt (X). The behavior of all PMTs except PMT 41 has relative ﬂat curve,

this is expected in the vacuum data since the Cherenkov events has low energy and

no events with low Fprompt except noise events. PMT 41 shows the strange behavior

in low Fprompt region, this also conﬁrmed the observation from previous plot. The

exact origin of the events in PMT 41 is unknown. These events are probably due to

some electrical malfunction such that the timing of the photoelectrons has a oﬀset

relative to the rest of the PMTs.2

The other events fall into low Fprompt and high charge ratio is the cross talk

induced by large pulse. Fro each WFD, there are 8 PMTs plugged into it. If any

2The timing mis-alignment is rejected for two reason : There are 8 PMTs plugging into the same

WFD board and the channel has been conﬁrmed with no issue.

one of the PMT received a large pulse for some reason, it will induce a small bipolar

pulse in the vicinity channels as shown in Fig. 7.23. These events happen more

frequently to some PMTs than others (Fig. 7.24) due to the fact that the NHit

trigger of MiniCLEAN requires 5 PMTs triggered in the same time. Therefore, for

the PMTs which plugged into the middle channel will have larger chance to pass the

NHit trigger. The more careful treatment and the cut will be described in Chapter

8.

MiniCLEAN Gas Run

Before the ﬁnal construction of MiniCLEAN is complete, the IV was ﬁlled with gas

at room temperature to take data for testing the system. The MiniCLEAN detector

start cooling on Aug. 2015 and the data taking of the cold gas run started on Oct.

2016. The cold gas data taking is continuous throughout the cooling and ﬁlling phase

of the MiniCLEAN detector. The main purpose of cold gas run is to monitor the

detector health using the triplet lifetime.

8.1 Warm Gas run

Warm gas data taking starts with IV ﬁlled with argon gas under the room temperature

and without any shielding. Using the RGA to monitor the gas quality as shown in Fig.

8.1, which indicates the main source of the impurity of the IV is from the outgassing

of acrylic (250 mtorr/l/min). The water vapor is known to heavily quenched the

triplet state of scintillation light. Figure 8.2 shows the triplet lifetime as a function

of time in the ﬁrst hour of ﬁlling. It shows that the triplet lifetime drops nearly 15

% in just one hour of the data. The quenching eﬀect can also be seen in the charge

ratio-Fprompt distribution of surface alpha particle as shown in Fig. 8.3

The tagged 22Na calibration run is performed after initial runs. A radioactive

22Na emits a positron which annihilate to two back-to-back 511 keV gammas with ra-

dioactivity of 30 kBq. The source is in a NaI scintillator crystal and optically coupled

to a PMT. The whole thing is placed on the top of IV. When the gamma scintillates

in the crystal, the PMT attached to the scintillator ﬁred. This assured the other

gamma is emitted in the direction of IV. Therefore the back-to-back 511 keV gamma

can be tagged in the data. In addition, a 1.275 MeV gamma is produced upon prompt

relaxation. Figure 8.4 shows the Fprompt-charge distribution in warm gas run with

(without) the 22Na presented. Figure 8.5 shows the Fprompt distribution between

tag 22Na and no tag data. These two distribution are very similar indicating there

is a problem with tagging. Later the problem was found that the NIM coincidence

board was failed to record the tagging PMT with the DAQ properly. The surface

alpha rate is measured in the warm gas run. As mentioned in the previous Chapter,

the surface alpha can be ejected into the Ar volume through the radon daughter de-

cay chain. Figure 8.6 shows the alpha induced argon scintillation. Compare to the

alpha-TPB scintillation in the vacuum, the alpha events in gaseous argon has larger

energy. This is due to the scintillation eﬃciency for alpha-TPB scintillation (∼ 880

photons/MeV[112]) is smaller than in the gaseous argon (13000 photons/MeV). The

measured surface alpha rate in the gaseous argon is 44.6 ± 0.7 events/hr[102].

8.2 Cold gas run

8.2.1 Overview

The data taking of cold gas run started from Oct. 2016. The motivation is to check the

detector health and the functionality of each component. During the data taking, the

temperature of IV is well under 140 K with pressure ∼ 1.5 bar. The cooling process

still going on with lower cooling rate due to the extra heat load from operating PMTs.

In the beginning of data taking, 18 PMTs initially deactivated. For 11 of these 18

deactivated PMTs we measured open circuits. We speculate that the connections

became loose during the incident of rapid temperature rise described in Chapter 6.5.

The 7 other PMTs (less electrically insulating) were intentionally deactivated due to

observed high voltage tripping while when operating in warm gas. In the ﬁrst two

runs, we observe some PMTs with low gain and we increased the HV for these by 50

V. However, for 10 PMTs the gain was not improved. Seven more PMTs that were

turned oﬀ during the early pump and purge runs due to observing excessive “ﬂasher"

events.1 These PMTs are turned back on approximately 124 hours since beginning of

pump and purge. In addition, PMT 41 is known to be noisy and PMT 35 was found

to have large background during the data taking. Therefore in the following analysis,

we will exclude these 30 (37 for early pump and purge run) PMTs which bring the

number of total well-functioned PMTs to 62 (55 for early pump and purge run). A

summary of PMT status by angular distribution is shown in Figure 8.7.

The main scintillation events are from the intrinsic 39Ar beta decay with full

shielding of IV. There are some scintillation events are from the internal gamma

particle induced electronic recoil. However, due to the low density of argon gas, only

low energy gamma can produce the electronic recoil. Figure 8.8 shows the attenuation

coeﬃcient as a function of density of argon. With the diameter of active volume of

1These events have very large fast pulses due primarily to electrical discharge.

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

144

IV, the energy of gamma particle under 40 keV can leave the trace inside the IV.

Figure 8.9 (a) shows the scatter plot of Fprompt and charge distribution. A band of

electronic recoil can be seen at Fprompt ∼ 0.2. In the scatter plot of charge ratio

and Fprompt as shown in Fig. 8.9 (b), a group of events at low Fprompt and low

charge ratio can be seen. These events are corresponds to the band of events in the

Fprompt-charge scatter plot. The Fprompt value of the electronic recoil is lower than

the value in the 22Na warm gas run (∼ 0.3) due to the better purity level of the argon

and thus longer triplet lifetime is attained.

Figure 8.7: Red : PMTs are oﬀ (no connection). Green : PMTs without conformal
coating (oﬀ in the gas run). Yellow : PMTs with very low gain except PMT 35 which
has excessive background and PMT 41 is known as noisy PMT, these two PMTs are
removed from analysis.

8.2.2 Triplet lifetime monitoring

As mentioned in the previous section, the detector health can be monitored by ob-

serving the triplet lifetime.

In the beginning of cold gas data taking, the triplet

lifetime is stable at around 3.5 µs until the temperature of the bottom of IV reaches

the liquefaction point of argon as shown in Fig. 8.10. At ﬁrst, this behavior was

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

146

explained due to some liquid build up in the bottom of IV such that when ﬁtting the

pulse time distribution from all PMTs, the average triplet lifetime is reduced due to

the fact that triplet lifetime in the liquid is smaller (∼ 1.6 µs). However, ﬁtting the

triplet lifetime for each active PMTs, no signiﬁcant variations is observed as shown

in Fig. 8.11. After thorough examination of the detector, a leak was found to be

responsible foe the reduction of triplet lifetime.

bottom of IV.

Figure 8.11: Triplet lifetime for each PMT. The red dashed line indicates the weighted
mean of triplet lifetime of all PMTs.

Figure 8.12 shows the triplet lifetime as a function of time. The triplet lifetime

starts decreasing after the bottom temperature sensor reaches the liquefaction point

of argon. While the exact timing of degradation of triplet lifetime is unknown, leaks

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

147

appear to have been developed sometime around mid-December 2016. The source of

leak was found later in the exhaust from the IV pump. Shown in Fig. 8.13, the source

was likely back-ﬂow of an argon/air mixture in the vent line through two check valves

placed in series (opposite the allowed ﬂow direction V4506 and PSV4507) leading to

the IV, indicated by the red arrows[117]. Subsequently, the impurities were pump

out of IV through a series pump and purge cycle(Detail description is in Chapter 9).

The triplet lifetime is successfully restore to the values before the leak after nearly

200 hours pump and purge cycle as shown in Fig. 9.6. This shows the eﬀectiveness of

monitoring the triplet lifetime. The triplet lifetime is kept tracking whenever there’s

ﬂow into IV to ensure the gas quality and detector health as well.

Figure 8.12: Triplet lifetime monitoring showing the period of time around the leak.

8.3 Trigger rate

Trigger rate is another important indicator to understand the functionality of the

whole system. The types of event can be roughly categorized as follows :

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

148

Figure 8.13: A cartoon schematic showing the cause of the air leak.

• Raw trigger rate : Total tigger rate calculated from events pass NHit trigger

(at least 5 PMTs has hit in the coincident window).

• Pass all cuts trigger rate : Trigger rate of events passed all cuts (baseline,

trigger time, saturation, trigger pileup).

• Cherenkov trigger rate : Events with charge ratio > 0.5 and Fprompt > 0.5.

• Instrument event trigger rate : Events with charge ratio >0.5 and Fprompt

< 0.5.

• ESR trigger rate : Events with charge ratio < 0.5 and Fprompt > 0.5.

• 39Ar trigger rate : Events with charge ratio < 0.5 and Fprompt <0.5.

The naming convention inherits from the vacuum data, the name indicates roughly

the type of events appears in the vacuum data except 39Ar events which just appears

in the gas runs. The trigger rate from each category are plotted against run number

for clarity as shown in Fig. 8.14.

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

149

Figure 8.14: Trigger rates for diﬀerent type of data in the cold gas runs. The rede
dashed line around run 820 indicates the HV of PMTs increased by 50V. The dashed
line around run 890 indicates the temperature of bottom of IV reaches liquefaction
point. The red dashed line around run 930 indicates the beginning of pump and purge
cycle.

The trigger rate starts oﬀ 15 Hz in the beginning of cold gas data taking. In the

ﬁrst two runs, the PMT gains were low, thus 50 V of HV was added to each PMT.

After gain adjustment, the raw trigger rate rises to near 30 Hz. The drops around

run 850 due to observed very low gain of extra PMTs (1,3,12,26,41,44,63,75,80,89).

This bring down the raw trigger rate to around 25 Hz. The raw trigger rate (charge

per trigger) for selected PMTs is plotted against the run number and zoom in to the

vicinity runs as shown in Fig. 8.15 (Fig. 8.16). The PMTs plotted here except PMT

2,5,73, are having very low gain. Noticed that there’s drop near the middle of the

plot. The exact reason for this drop is unknown due to no data taking during that

period of time. However, these malfunctioned PMTs has way lower noise rate (∼ 60

Hz) than the rest of PMTs (∼ 400 Hz), indicating either they still have very low gain

or some other unforeseeable reasons.

The PMT gain seems decreasing before the leak. This may be due to the fact

that temperature of the IV is getting colder and colder, thus the eﬃciency of the

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

150

Figure 8.15: Trigger rates for selected PMTs (see text) vs run number. The blue circle
is from PMT 5 (well functioned) serve as a reference. The red dashed line indicates
the timing of rising PMT gain. PMT 2 and 73 are well functioned PMTs.

multiplication through the dynode chain decreased. Therefore, the observed trigger

rate decreased gradually according to the PMT gains. On the other hand, the trigger

rate for diﬀerent type of event are stable before the leak. The average temperature

of IV is varying between 140 to 100 K and the average pressure is around 1500 mbar.

The density of argon can be calculate according to the ideal gas law :

ρ =

P
RsT

(8.1)

where P is the pressure of IV and Rs is the speciﬁc gas constant (for argon : 0.208

kJ/(kg · K)), and T is the temperature of the IV. The beta decay rate of 39Ar is

1 bq/kg and IV is roughly sphere with 90 cm diameter. The expected trigger rate

can be estimated from 1.985 to 2.748 Hz depends on the actual temperature and

pressure of IV. The observed trigger rate for 39Ar is at reasonable range considering

the detector eﬃciency.

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

151

Figure 8.16: Charge pr trigger for selected PMTs (see text) vs run number. The
blue circle is from PMT 5 (well functioned) serve as a reference. The red dashed line
indicates the timing of rising PMT gain. PMT 2 and 73 are well functioned PMTs.

After the leak, the trigger rate of all types of event decreased. It is reasonable that

the 39Ar event rate decreased to zero since the impurity quenching the triplet states

results in no or very little late light. The same for the instrument event rate which

mostly come from the PMT discharging events. While the late light of scintillation

events is gone, there is no source of event with low Fprompt to produce the PMT

discharging. Therefore the discharging events are only exist in high Fprompt region.

However, the raw trigger rate after the leak is less than third of the rate before the

leak. This might be due to the decreasing PMT gain. Figure 8.17 shows the PMT

charge per trigger for selected PMTs, noticed that since the beginning of leak, the

PMT gain is decreasing gradually. Unlike the previous case, the temperature of IV is

not decreasing and instead it is increasing due to the extra heat load from operating

PMT continuously. Therefore, the reason that the PMT gain is decreasing gradually

might due to operating the PMT continuously for more than 400 hours during the

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

152

pump and purge runs. This is conﬁrmed by comparing the SPE value before and

after the leak as shown in Fig. 8.18. Almost all PMT gain decreased by as much as

factor of two.

Figure 8.17: Charge pr trigger for selected PMTs (see text) vs run number. The blue
dashed line separate the runs by the approximate timing of the leak.

8.4 Instrument eﬀect

8.4.1 WFD single ﬁred

As mentioned in Chapter 7.4, the huge pulse will induce the cross-talk within the

same WFD board. These events also appears in the gas data and needed to be

removed in order to improve the data quality. The event rate for single WFD ﬁred

events is increasing as the raw trigger rate increased. Figure 8.19 shows the event

rate for WFD single ﬁred events before and after the leak. The cut is deﬁned as in

given events, if only the PMTs in the same WFD are ﬁred, then the cut is true. Due

to the PMTs relative position, the PMTs in the same WFD are on the same side

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

153

Figure 8.18: SPE value for runs before and after the leak. Figure from [118].

of IV. Therefore, scintillation events in active volume can not trigger just one side

of the IV due to the homogenous re-emission of TPB. This ensure that the events

triggered just one WFD will highly unlikely from scintillation events. In addition, for

the suspicious events, the maximum charge of the pulse in the prompt window (-20 to

80 ns) divided by total charge in the prompt window can further reduce the chance to

cut on the scintillation events. Figure 8.20 shows the scatter plot of above mentioned

parameters. These two cuts can identify the single WFD ﬁred events eﬃciently and

preserved data quality.

The fraction of single WFD ﬁred events before and after the leak is very similar.

Figure 8.21 shows the scatter plot of charge-Fprompt distribution before and after the

cut for events before and after the leak. The charge-Fprompt distribution for events

removed by this cut is shown in 8.22. This shows most single WFD ﬁred events are

with small charge. The Fprompt of these events are aﬀect by random noise, after-

pulsing and some strange events with unknown source mostly in PMT 41 as shown

in Fig. 8.23. Table 8.1 summarize the number of events removed from the data and

the fraction in each data sets.

8.4.2 Pulse-cut algorithm

When operating PMT in the gaseous argon, the PMT discharging through GAr is

observed[119]. The GAr provided a preferential route for the current at anode of PMT

to discharge due to the low dielectric strength of GAr. This results in continuously

register pulses throughout the trigger window and subsequently fake the long triplet

lifetime. Figure 8.24. shows the example events with one PMT channel is discharging

through the GAr. These events usually has PMT discharging in one channel and

with excessive charge such that bias the centroid reconstructed radius toward the

given PMT. Therefore the radius cut is needed to remove these events from ﬁtting

the triplet lifetime. The pulse-cut is developed to identify these discharging event.

Plotting the ratio of pulse height and pulse area against pulse area as shown in Fig.

8.25. Projecting these peak onto Y axis, we can see there’s three distinct peaks. The

pulse shape of ﬁrst peak (0 -0.05 in 8.25(b)) usually has wide base line and small

amplitude as shown in Fig. 8.26. These pulse shapes could results from baseline shift

to produce the ringing. Second peak (0.05 -0.1 in 8.25(b)) includes the events has

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

157

huge double pulse as shown in Fig. 8.27, these might results from the scintillation

events discharging through GAr. The third peak (0.15 -0.25 in 8.25(b)) contains pulse

which has sharp pulse shape as shown in Fig. 8.28, these pulse might results from

the events with fast pulse discharging through GAr.

The pulse cut is deﬁned as following

• peak1 : Events fall in peak 1 region.

• peak2 : Events fall in peak 2 region and hits > 2

• peak3 : Events fall in peak 3 region with maximum charge of the pulse > 100

pC.

A MC simulation of 39Ar is performed to estimate the cut eﬃciency. Figure 8.29

(a) shows the maximum charge in the PMTs plotted against the total charge of the

event from MC simulation. Comparing to the same plot from the data as shown in

Fig. 8.29 (b), there’s a band of events which is not seen in the MC simulation. This

shows the abnormal huge pulse results from the PMT discharging. After applied the

some huge pulse still remain in the data, but this shows the pulse cut removed most

unwanted events and preserved good eﬃciency on the scintillation events. Table 8.2

8.4.3 Baseline Sag

In the study of the pulse cut, 99% of the PMT discharging events has maximum

charge of the event in the PMT discharging channel as shown in 8.31. The rest of

the events come from PMT baseline sag or multiple PMT discharging. When PMT

gets larger amount of photons the photocathode is heavily depleted. During the time

that photocathode restoring back to original potential, the low frequency baseline

oscillation is presented. The digitizer’s dynamic range is set to accept negtive voltage

This cause the charge integral value for channel has baseline sag artiﬁcially high as

shown in Fig. 8.32.

8.4.4 Switching noise

The DAQ system is continuously taking data after the leak was found. A type of

noise event was found in the data. These pulses constantly present in some PMTs at

around 2600 ns after the trigger time. Figure 8.33 shows the pulse-time distribution

from all PMTs, in the Run 918 no excessive pulses at around 2600 ns, but it emerged

in Run 919. It was found these events are very similar to the high voltage switching

noise which is studied previously[120]. These bimodal pulses (Fig. 8.34) origin from

the power supply and picks up by the pulse ﬁnding algorithm. These events were

found in the data and appear randomly in all PMTs. However, after the leak, these

pulses are found just appear to some of the PMTs (PMT 26,35,41,42,43,44,45,46).

Nonetheless, these can be easily removed from the data[121].

8.5 Relative light yield

The PMTs are calibrated using single photoelectrons (SPE) from late scintillation

light which is low intensity and therefore dominated by single photons (see Figure

8.35). Using the timing p.d.f. from Figure 9.2, we can calculate the pile-up proba-

bility and identify the region dominated by single photons and get the SPE charge

distribution for each PMT. The SPE charge distribution contains two components,

the contribution from real single photons and background (dark hits, electronic noise

etc.). The background component is included in the ﬁt procedure. The background

model is obtained using a random, periodic trigger. The SPE distribution is ﬁtted

using double-gamma function[106] as shown in Figure 8.36.

The average charge of argon scintillation (Fp<0.5 and QR<0.6) events for each

run can be calculated with calibrated charge distribution. Figure 8.37 shows the

charge distribution from diﬀerent run at diﬀerent stage of detector. For the run

before the leak (Run 852), more events with higher charge in the charge distribution.

When the triplet component quenched by impurity (Run 889), the high energy event

disappeared. For runs in the pump and purge cycle, with recovering of triplet lifetime

which means the recovery of triplet component, the high energy events are increased.

Noticed that the Run 852 and 955 both has triplet lifetime at around 3500 ns, but

Run 955 has less high energy events. This can be seen in the plot of average charge

as a function of run number as shown in Fig. 8.38. Around run 820, the HV of PMTs

were rose by 50 V, results in increased average charge. When the triplet state started

quenched by impurity, the average charge decreased. With high impurity of the gas,

huge fraction of light yield is suppressed and the detector starts to recover the light

yield and triplet lifetime during the pump and purge. Noticed that even when the

triplet lifetime is recovered to the previous value (∼ 3500 ns), the light yield just

barely back to the half as much as previous value. This diﬀerence might be explained

by the diﬀerence of trigger rate. From previous section, the trigger rate before and

after the leak is very diﬀerent. The total raw trigger rate dropped from 25 Hz (before

the leak) to 7 Hz indicating the contribution from some events is missing.

triplet lifetime at 3500 ns. Run 889 : Last run before triplet component disappeared

After the a thorough study, there’s a events from 39Ar but not fall in the cut region

are unaccounted for the charge distribution. Figure 8.39 shows the charge ratio and

Fprompt distribution for runs in the pump and purge cycle. Figure 8.39 (a) is from

the earlier pump and purge run and (d) is the latter pump and purge run. Noticed

that the events in low QR and high Fprompt in (a) is the 39Ar events with quenched

late component. With the impurity pumped out of IV, 39Ar events recovering its

late component and move gradually to the low Fprompt region throughout the course

of pump and purge cycle. Finally when the triplet lifetime restore to the previous

value, the group of events from 39Ar scintillation settles at low Fprompt region. A

interesting phenomenon is observed, when the group of events in low QR moving

toward the low Fprompt, another group of events with high QR and almost the same

Fprompt move along with the 39Ar events toward the low Fprompt region. It is latter

found that these events are mostly from 39Ar scintillation with one PMT channel

with discharging such that it pushes the events to high QR due to the fact that the

discharging channel have artiﬁcially high charge. This also happens to the data before

the leak but less frequent. Figure 8.40 (a) shows the raw waveform of all PMTs from

the discharging events. It is clear to see one channel has continuous pulses throughout

the 16 µs window. Figure 8.40 (b) shows the pulse-time distribution from discharging

events with simple exponential ﬁt. The ﬁt result shows it is compatible with the

lifetime acquired from 39Ar events and proved its origin.

Plotting the charge distribution for events with Frpompt >0.5 (<0.5) as shown

in Fig. 8.41 (a) (Fig 8.41 (b)), the diﬀerence become much smaller for events with

Fprompt < 0.5. For events with Fprompt > 0.5, mostly contains fast events (e.g.

Cherenkov light), they agree in low energy and runs before the leak has more relative

high energy events. Noticed a “bump” shows up in high energy (2000 -3500 PE) for

runs after the leak with Fprompt < 0.5. These events are due to the artiﬁcial high

charge of PMT discharging events. Using the pulse cut to identify the channel with

the “bump” disappeared as shown in Fig. 8.42. The two distribution have similar end

point and the runs before the leak has more high energy events. This may attribute

to the decreased PMT gain for runs after the leak such that the trigger rate decreased

and the contribution from higher energy events decreased.

8.6 Post pump and purge run

The cooling of MiniCLEAN detector continue after the triplet lifetime is restored.

Another reduction was found around 420 hours after the beginning of the pump and

purge cycle.

In order to understand the source of the leak, a series of excise are

performed to identify the source. Figure 8.43 shows the triplet lifetime as a function

of time. Noticed that in the zoom-in plot, several excises are performed to test the

hypothesis. First, just before the time that the reduction of triplet lifetime happened.

The condenser is running to ﬂow LAr into IV. In the same time a unexpected power

outage shuts the system oﬀ, thus the cryocooler was shut oﬀ for 10 hours. This

makes the cold ﬁnger warm up to over 140 K which might release the oxygen which

condensed on the cold ﬁnger after the leak into the IV and causing the reduction

of triplet lifetime. The other hypothesis is that during the condenser running, the

pressure of the condenser soar to unusual high pressure. This may loosen some ﬁtting

inside the nitrogen space of the condenser and results in leaking nitrogen or possibly

some other impurity into the IV. The results shows the triplet lifetime decreased

further when the cold ﬁnger warmed up, and stable for the rest of the test. This

indicates that the impurity condensed on the cold ﬁnger might responsible for the

reduction of the triplet lifetime.

warm up. b : condenser pressurized. c : condenser depressurized. d : condenser
running.

CHAPTER 8. MINICLEAN GAS RUN

171

Furthermore, to rule out the possible temperature/pressure eﬀect , the pressure,

temperature and density of the argon gas is plotted against time as shown in Fig.

8.44. Figure 8.45 shows the same quantities for the time zoomed in at right before

the cold ﬁnger warm up (second dashed line to the right in Fig. 8.44). In theory, with

higher density the triplet lifetime is decreased and vis versa. From the plot, although

in Fig. 8.45 the triplet lifetime seems correlated with the increased density. However,

in Fig. 8.44, the longer triplet lifetime is attained even with higher density. Thus the

density eﬀect should not be the main reason for reduction of triplet lifetime.

Figure 8.44: From the top to bottom panel. triplet lifetime,pressure,temperature and
density.

A simple model can be used to estimate how much impurity has been released

into the IV. The cold ﬁnger is well-aboved boiling point of oxygen for 10 hours which

according to the relationship between triplet lifetime and impurity level (Fig. 9.11)

introduced 0.12 ppm of the additional impurity. In terms of atoms, 3.36 ×1017 atoms

is released from cold ﬁnger over 10 hours. The rate is 0.336 × 1017 atoms/s. For the

cold ﬁnger warm up excise, the cold ﬁnger is warm for 2 hours and the impurity level

increased by 0.02 ppm. The calculated rate is 0.285 × 1017 which in agreement with

previous result. Considering the impurity level after the leak is 300 ppm, with the

density. Zoom in at right before the second red dashed line to the right.

surface area of cold ﬁnger is around 700 cm2, it takes more than 20 hours to purge

the impurity out of IV.

Subsequently, the second pump and purge cycle is performed. During the cycle,

the same excise to warm up the cold ﬁnger is test again to ensure this is main reason

for the reduction of triplet lifetime. Figure 8.46 shows that right after the cryocooler

warms up, the triplet lifetime drops and recovered after the cryocooler is turned back

on. This indicates the impurity condensed on cold ﬁnger is the main reason for the

reduction of the triplet lifetime.

Figure 8.46: Triplet lifetime as a function of time. Notice that when the cryocooler
is oﬀ, the triplet lifetime drops and increased when cryocooler is turned back on.

Chapter 9

Triplet lifetime measurement in Cold

Gas

Understanding of the relationship between triplet lifetime and impurity level of the

gas is important. The limit of RGA sensitivity is around sub-ppm level. However,

the required purity of argon is < 100 ppb. Therefore if the relationship of triplet

lifetime and impurity level is known, the triplet lifetime can be an indicator to reveal

the current impurity level of the gas. Using it to monitor the detector health has

been described in detail in Chapter 8. In this chapter, the detail analysis of ﬁnding

the relationship of triplet lifetime and impurity level is presented.

9.1 Triplet lifetime

9.1.1 Analysis summary

During diﬀerent data taking period, diﬀerent numbers of PMTs are turned on. Nor-

mally, 62 PMTs are on except from the beginning of pump and purge (Run 931) until

the middle of pump and purge (Run 951), 55 PMTs are activated. The position of

PMTs is shown in Fig. 8.7, numbers in color indicates the PMT is oﬀ, the explana-

tion of color index is described in the caption. In the cold gas run, many PMTs are

removed from analysis for diﬀerent reasons :

• PMT Channel Number : 7,15,18,19,24,43,66,68,76,88,91, total 11 PMTs with

no connection (deactivated).

• PMT Channel Number : 14,17,53,54,55,70,72, total 7 PMTs without conformal

coating (deactivated).

• PMT Channel Number : 1,3,6,12,26,44,63,75,80,89, total 10 PMTs has very low

gain.

• PMT Channel Number : 35, with high background.

• PMT Channel Number : 41, known as noisy PMT.

• PMT Channel Number : 0,2,4,9,10,11,13, total 7 PMTs found to be noisy,

turned oﬀ during early pump and purging runs (Run 931 - 951). They are

included in the later runs (Run 953 - 978).

The existing of PMT discharging events in one channel will bias the centroid recon-

structed radius toward the edge of the detector which results in the excessive events

near the edge of IV (Figure 9.36). Therefore, the additional radius cut is applied to

the data and deﬁne as (R/RT P B)3 < 0.7. Where R is the centroid reconstructed ra-

dius, RT P B is the radius of the TPB (wavelength shifter) which deﬁne the maximum

radius of active volume. The cut eﬃciency determined by MC simulation decreased

to 88.30%. The data passed cut are ﬁtted with simple exponential function plus

constant background:

SPE arrival time using Bayesian techniques developed by MiniCLEAN collaboration

is used[98].

9.1.2 First cold gas runs : Oct. 2016 to Feb. 2017

The IV continues to be to cooled while data taking. During this period the ﬁtted

triplet lifetime is used to monitor the detector health as well as the dependance of

triplet lifetime on pressure/temperature. Throughout the cooling we must continu-

ously ﬂow argon through the puriﬁcation system, condenser and into the IV. Potential

contamination could arise from a leak between ﬁttings or from material outgassing.

Data is taken every week to ensure the purity of the argon gas and the stability of

triplet lifetime indicates the IV is free from contamination. Figure 9.5 shows the

stability of triplet lifetime as a function of time that ﬂowing was temporarily stopped

(static mode). Figure 8.12 shows the triplet lifetime over a time period in which a

leak was discovered. The triplet lifetime began decreasing after the bottom temper-

ature sensor reached the liquefaction point of argon. While the exact timing of the

gas contamination is unknown, the leak appears to have been developed sometime

around mid-December 2016. The source of leak was determined to be exhaust from

the IV pump (see Figure 8.13).

CHAPTER 9. TRIPLET LIFETIME MEASUREMENT IN COLD GAS

179

9.1.3 Pump and purge runs

As soon as the leak is identiﬁed and ﬁxed, we begin the pump and purge cycle to purge

the impurities from the IV. In the beginning, we are pumping the gas out of IV and

purge with pure argon (impurity < 1 ppb). However, it seems this approach didn’t

pump out the impurity eﬃciently, probably due to the complicated geometry of the

IV leaving trapped gas. We then decided to increase the pressure while purging and

lower the pressure when pumping on IV. This method quickly increase the purity of

the gas inside the IV. From the point of view of data taking, this procedure starts from

Run 931 (3/30/2017) and end in Run 970 (4/13/2017), with total pump and purge of

around 434 hours, we successfully restored the triplet lifetime to the good value prior

to the leak. Figure 9.6, shows the changes in triplet lifetime as a function of pump and

purge time. In the early pump and purge runs, the triplet tail has very few events,

so diﬀerent ﬁtting range is used to get a reasonable χ2/NDF and lifetime. Figure 9.7

shows the example of ﬁtting in Run 931, noticed that the electronic switching noise is

presented around 2600 ns which results in larger χ2/NDF (∼ 2.83) value. The overall

χ2/NDF for each hour is shown in Fig. 9.8.

The IV leak gave us the opportunity to investigate the relationship between

triplet lifetime and the associated impurity level. Unfortunately the RGA is not

sensitive to the impurity level below 1 ppm, thus a model to describe the impurity

level decreased with pump and purge cycle is needed. The initial impurity level is

well above 10 ppm thus it can be attained directly from measurement of RGA. In

the early pump and purge cycle, RGA samples the IV outlet gas approximately every

40 minutes. After RGA background subtraction, the total initial impurity level is

estimated as 40.86 ± 2.63 ppm. The pressure during the pump and purge cycle can

be extracted from slow control system1as shown in Fig. 9.9. With this information,

1Slow Control System is builded base on MySQL database system, which record the detector

parameter in real time and store in MySQL database[122].

CHAPTER 9. TRIPLET LIFETIME MEASUREMENT IN COLD GAS

180

the fraction of gas pump out from IV can be estimated for each cycle. Therefore the

behavior of degradation of impurity level can be approximated by this equation

dI(t)
dt

= −

(cid:15)f
T

· I0

(9.3)

where I(t) is the impurity level as a function of time, T is the pump and purging

period, I0 is the initial impurity level, f is the fraction of gas pumped out in each

cycle and (cid:15) is the purge eﬃciency. For each cycle the temperature changes is very

small ((cid:28) 1K), so we will ignore the eﬀect from the temperature variations. In this

analysis, we assume the purge eﬃciency is 1, and use the recursive form (Eq. 9.1.3)

to estimate the impurity level at the end of each cycle

Ii+1 = Ii · (1 − fi)

(9.4)

However, due to the low trigger rate(∼ 8 Hz), we need more time to accumulate

events in order to ﬁt for the triplet lifetime. Therefore, two diﬀerent approaches are

used to map triplet lifetime to the impurity level.

Firstly, the impurity level is changing during the pump and purge cycle, using

Eq. 9.1.3 and integrated over the period of cycle, one can get the average impurity

level across the pump and purge cycle.

IAvg = Ii ·

1 − e−fi+1
fi+1

(9.5)

This gives the average impurity level (IAvg) for (i + 1)-th cycle. Using the taylor

expansion Eq. 9.1.3 can be approximated as Ii · (1 − fi+1/2). With average fraction

of pump out gas is 6.6%, the average impurity for each cycle is ≈ Ii · (0.97)i+1 for

(i+1)-th cycle. The pulse time of scintillation events are populated into histogram

during the period of time T for each cycle and map to the average impurity level in

CHAPTER 9. TRIPLET LIFETIME MEASUREMENT IN COLD GAS

181

the same period of time.

Another way to map the impurity level and lifetime is to use the impurity level

at the end of pumping, then populate the pulse time of scintillation events in the

following time until the beginning of next pump and purge cycle. In this period of

time T’, the IV is approximately at static, so the impurity level should not change

signiﬁcantly. Therefore we can map the lifetime measured in this period of time to

the impurity level which estimated just right before the beginning of IV at static.

The cartoon describe both methods is shown in Fig. 9.10.

Figure 9.6: Triplet lifetime vs the time since the beginning of pump and purge, the
blue dashed line indicate the time pumping is stopped, IV at static after that.

where τm is the measured triplet lifetime, τN is a ﬁt parameter representing the natural

triplet lifetime with zero impurity present in gaseous argon, η is the total impurity

level in ppm and k is the ﬁtting constant. The result is conﬁrmed by using the other

method of measuring the impurity as described in previous section, the ﬁtting results

is consistent with the results from using the average impurity as shown in 9.13. We

will adopt the average impurity for following analysis.

Alternatively, we can convert the lifetime to the decay rate and use the inverse

function of Eq. 9.6 to ﬁt a line

Rm = RN · (1 + k · η)

(9.7)

where Rm and RN are the inverse lifetimes (decay rates). Figure 9.13 shows the decay

rate as a function of impurity level. The product of RN and k is the reaction rate per

ppm between argon and the impurity molecule. The reaction rate between argon and

impurity molecule has been measured by various group[123][124][79]. The dominant

impurity species in MinCLEAN detector are oxygen and nitrogen at the operating

temperature (<140 K). The quenching eﬀect from nitrogen diminished with impurity

level less than 1 ppm[125], therefore we assume the quenched light yield is mainly due

oxygen when impurity level is below 1 ppm. Thus the reaction rate obtained from the

ﬁt represent the reaction rate between triplet state of argon and oxygen. The result

is 11.7 × 10−10cm3/s, which is in rough agreement with the results from the literature

2.6 × 10−10cm3/s[123] and the results from K. Mavrokoridis (35 × 10−10cm3/s)[125].

We note that the χ2 of both ﬁts are large, due to a discrepancy in the high

impurity level region. This implies either the functional form of does not describe

the behavior in high impurity level (> 1ppm) or some additional systematic error

occurs in that region. We do not know of any such systematic error in our data. We

speculate that the functional form is altered at large impurity due to nitrogen which

CHAPTER 9. TRIPLET LIFETIME MEASUREMENT IN COLD GAS

185

is known to strongly quench the triplet state for concentration above 1 ppm[125]. As

a cross check we reﬁt the data averaging the lifetime and impurity every four hours

and obtained very similar results with satisfactory χ2(Figure 9.14). This conﬁrms

that the ﬁtting results presents here is reliable.

In the literature, P. Moutard [76] collect the measurement from diﬀerent exper-

iments and acquired a equation to describe the behavior of triplet decay rate as a

function of number density. Figure 9.15 shows P. Moutard’s function in the green

dashed line, the black points are older experimental results (prior 2000), the blue

points is newer results (after 2000) and the red points are the results from this anal-

ysis. This plot shows our results is in agreement with previous experimental results.

9.2 LY and Late/Prompt Ratio

To determine the light yield (LY), we use the same cut to select 39Ar events.

In

gaseous argon (GAr), the scintillation light is produced in three continuous wavelength

bands. In principle, the prompt light is mainly from longest wavelength band (third

continuum, 180 - 210 nm) and the intermediate component is from singlet state

of the second continuum (128 nm)[86]. The triplet state of second continuum is

three component can be determined. Figure 9.16 shows the example of ﬁtting.

Light yield (LY) for each component. We choose the prompt component using

the mean ± 3σ region to populate the charge of each events into a histogram and

determine the mean of the distribution. The starting point to accumulate events for

the late component is from 80 ns to the end of data acquisition window. Lastly,

the time window for intermediate component is from the end of prompt window

until the beginning of the late window. The mean light yield for each components is

determined from the charge distribution and plotted against triplet lifetime as shown

in Figure 9.18. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the prompt and intermediate component

is relatively ﬂat compared to the late component. It is conﬁrmed that the singlet state

of second continuum (intermediate component) is not aﬀected by the impurities while

triplet state of second continuum (slow component) is strongly quenched. Moreover,

the prompt states which comes from mostly the third continuum are not aﬀect by

impurities either.

The late/prompt ratio is obtained by directly integrating the summed waveform

according to the diﬀerent windows mentioned in last paragraph. The ratio is deter-

mined from summed waveform hourly and calculate the mean and standard deviation

in each run. In the cold gas runs, the electronic switching noise from unknown sources

present at around 2600 ns makes the mean of the late integrated charge artiﬁcially

large especially for runs with low triplet lifetime. The additional PMTs are removed

from determining the late/prompt ratio to suppress the switching noise. This brings

the total number of PMTs down to 56 (49) for pump and purge runs (early pump and

purge runs). In addition, for each run, the ﬂat background is identiﬁed by the ﬁtter

and subtracted from the data. The ﬁnal results as a function of the average triplet

lifetime run by run as shown in Figure 9.19. The late/prompt ratio determined by this

method is 6.215 ± 0.007. The discrepancy between our results and the results from

[130] is mainly from the diﬀerent ionizing particle. The value 5.5 ± 0.6 is obtained

using alpha particles known to produces more prompt light than electronic recoils.

Therefore our value extracted from electronic recoil is in the reasonable range and

consistent with the their result.

• Variations between PMTs

• Radius eﬀect

• Systematic error on determining the impurity level

The 1-σ region or the RMS of distribution will be used to quote the systematic error

in the following analysis.

9.3.1 Density eﬀect

Throughout the pump and purging cycle, the temperature of IV is slowly increased

and the pressure is changing. We can use average pressure and temperature in each

hour to ﬁnd out the variation of density during the pump and purge cycle. Using

the equation from P. Moutard’s [76] (green dashed line in Fig. 9.15) to ﬁnd out

the systematic errors causing by density variation. Figure 9.21 shows the number

of density for each hour in pump and purging cycle populated into histogram. The

histogram is ﬁtted to a Gaussian distribution, and using the mean and 1-σ variation,

after mapping to the Fig. 9.15, we estimate the systematic error from the density

eﬀect is 0.07%.

9.3.2 PMT gain variation

In the pump and purge runs, we utilized the late light of scintillation events to de-

termine the SPE value for each PMTs. The SPE value is determined on run to run

basis, thus in order to estimate the gain variation hourly, we use the prompt light of

scintillation events to estimate the PMT gain variation. The variation could aﬀect the

eﬃciency on pulse ﬁnding and results in systematic errors on determining the triplet

lifetime. Figure 9.22 shows the relative gain variation during Run 962 (> 33 hr), this

run is used to estimate the systematic errors due to the PMT gain variations. The

relative gain variation is deﬁned as RMS of gain variation in 33 hr divided by mean

gain in the 33 hr. Using the relative gain variation in Fig. 9.22, modify the PMT

gain in the pulse ﬁnding algorithm. Then ﬁt the modiﬁed pulse-time distribution

and compare it with unmodiﬁed result as shown in Fig. 9.23(a). We can estimate

the systematic error from the histogram of diﬀerence between two results divided by

unmodiﬁed result as shown in 9.23(b). The estimated systematic error from the RMS

of the distribution is ± 0.26%.

9.3.3 Pulse ﬁnding algorithm

By comparing the ﬁtting results between pulse-time distribution and summed wave-

form, we can estimate the systematic error results from pulse ﬁnding algorithm. Fig-

ure 9.24 shows the ﬁtted triplet lifetime from pulse-time distribution and overlap

with results from summed waveform and Fig. 9.25 shows the weighted mean for two

diﬀerent methods. The example of ﬁtting for pulse-time distribution and summed

waveform is shown in Fig. 9.26. Due to the larger error bar of the bins in the

summed waveform, the ﬁtted result has larger error bar for each hour of the data.

The systematic error is estimated from comparing the results of the ﬁt, this gives the

estimated systematic error to be 0.39% as shown in Fig. 9.27.

form (blue) overlap in the plot.

9.3.4 Pumping on the IV

us the eﬀect on triplet lifetime from pumping the IV. Figure 9.28 shows the triplet

9.3.5 Variation between PMTs

In the earlier results, the variation of triplet lifetime is large. Figure 9.30 shows the

triplet lifetime of PMTs with cut : Qratio <0.6 and Fprompt <0.5 using χ2 ﬁt. It

is clear to see that the PMT 35 has larger background than the rest of PMTs, so

we decided to remove this PMT from analysis.

In this section, the data used to

estimate the triplet lifetime variation between PMTs are after the lifetime reaches

stable states (see Fig. 9.6). Using the same ﬁtting function (eq. (1)) to ﬁt the pulse-

time distribution PMT by PMT. The result is shown in Fig. 9.31. The possible reason

of the variations may due to the fact that the top and bottom PMTs has higher event

rates than the others and aﬀects the ﬁnal ﬁtting results. The estimated systematic

error from PMTs variation is 0.96% as shown in Fig. 9.32.

9.3.6 Radius

In the earlier results, the triplet lifetime increased with increasing radius as shown in

Fig. 9.33. The triplet lifetime seems correlated not only with radius but also with the

background fraction as shown in Fig. 9.34. In order to understand the radius eﬀect,

we decouple the background dependance of the triplet lifetime. We perform a pseudo-

experiment to investigate the eﬀect of background on the triplet lifetime. First, using

the pulse-cut algorithm (described in 8.4.2) we can identify the background events,

which mostly from PMT discharging as shown in Fig. 9.35. These PMT discharging

background will fake long lifetime and pull the centroid reconstructed radius toward

the edge of IV. In Fig. 9.36, it is clear to see that the peaks close to the edge of IV,

therefore the radius cut is added ((R/RT P B)3 < 0.7, approximately R (cid:39) 386 mm. see

section 9.1) to reduce the eﬀect from the PMT discharging events. After applied the

radius cut, the residual background events looks fairly ﬂat as shown in Fig. 9.37. We

then deﬁne a pseudo-experiment to investigate the radius eﬀect. If we assume the

true lifetime is some number, then we pick a random number according to the Fig.

9.36, we can ﬁnd the corresponding background fraction in Fig. 9.38 which is ﬁtted to

4-th oder of polynomial function. Using the ﬁtting function (eq. (1)) to produce the

random number, ﬁx the triplet lifetime and vary the background component. We then

use the same function to ﬁt the pseudo data and compare with the ﬁtting results from

the data. In each hour of data, the scintillation events comes from diﬀerent positions

inside the IV, the pseudo-experiment takes this eﬀect into account. The diﬀerence

reveals the radius eﬀect on the triplet lifetime. The results is shown in Fig. 9.39.

The bias of the histogram is due to the fact that true lifetime is inaccessible. The

estimate systematic error from radius eﬀect is ± 1.31%.

9.4.2 PMT variation

Due to the inhomogeneity of gas distribution in the IV, the collection eﬃciency would

be diﬀerent for each PMTs. We can use the late/prompt ratio of each PMT to observe

the LY variations between PMTs. The mean late/prompt ratio is shown in Fig.

9.43. Populating the ratio from each PMTs into histogram and ﬁt with Gaussian

distribution, the systematic error can be determined. The results is ± 12.38% as

shown in Fig. 9.44.

9.5 Summary

Triplet lifetime is important for doing pulse shape discrimination in gaseous/liquid

argon detector. The residual impurities in argon will lead to the degradation of both

triplet lifetime and light yield. Subsequently aﬀects the PSD and the energy resolu-

tion of the detector. We investigate the detail correlation between triplet lifetime and

impurity level which helps to monitor the detector health before and after the com-

mission of the detector. Moreover, with better PMT coverage, we found the triplet

lifetime with zero impurity is 3.470 ± 0.001 µs which is the longest lifetime has been

measured at 1.5 bar and temperature less than 140 K, to our knowledge.

Furthermore, we present the results of relative light yield and the late/prompt

ratio. The relative light yield reveals the origin of the quenching eﬀects of impurity

molecule. They mainly interact with the triplet state of second continuum and results

in loss of light yield. The detail analysis on light yield from each component suggest

that the impurity molecule did not aﬀect the prompt (third continuum) and singlet

state (second continuum) except at very high impurity level (>100 ppm). This is

probably due to the relative fast lifetime of these two components and low reaction

rate when impurity level is low. The late/prompt ratio gives a quantitative deﬁnition

of the scintillation timing structure. The best value of the late/prompt ratio has been

measured as 6.215 ± 0.007 which has better precision than previously measured[130]

due to the high purity of our argon as evidenced by our long triplet lifetime. The

measured long triplet lifetime in gaseous argon can in principle improve the PSD re-

jection ability with no extra cost. Also, the low density of gaseous argon reduced the

chance of multi-scattering of neutron which is the main background in the region of

WIPMs searching. Despite the low event rate in the gaseous argon, the above prop-

erties provides better background rejection and could be a new approach of designing

the detector for future dark matter experiment.

Energy scale calibration

39Ar beta decay in the LAr is the major background for LAr detector. However, it

is uniformly distribute throughout the volume and with deﬁnite energy spectrum. It

can be used to calibrate the detector and monitoring the detector health on daily

basis.

10.1 39Ar beta decay

39Ar is a radioactive nulclide exists in the atmosphere with radioactivity of 1Bq/kg.

Argon is produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air which contains the 39Ar

as well. The radioactive 39Ar decay to 39K through ﬁrst forbidden beta decay

39Ar −→39 K + e− + ¯νe

(10.1)

The parent nucleus and the recoil daughter nucleus are assumed at static before and

after the reaction. Which means that the electron and the neutrino carries most of

the energy.1. Unlike the alpha decay which the end product (alpha) has a distinct

energy, the beta decay has a continuous energy distribution due to the momentum

1Even in the worst possible case(free neutron decay), the largest possible energy carried by proton

is about 0.4 keV whcih is just 0.05% of the reaction Q-value.

211

CHAPTER 10. ENERGY SCALE CALIBRATION

212

conservation. The energy of beta depends on the energy that carried away by the

“invisible” neutrino.

The total spin (Sβ) of beta and neutrino can be either 1 or 0 (Fig. 10.1), both of

these can combine with S=1/2 of the neutron for a resultant vector of 1/2. The two

diﬀerent type of beta decay can be deﬁned as Fermi beta decay (Sβ = 0) and Gamow-

Teller(GT) beta decay (Sβ = 1) which are named after the people who ﬁrst described

the mode. The Q-value of the reaction can be calculated and the β-endpoint which is

the maximum energy carried by the electron (i.e. the energy of neutrino approaches

zero) can be determined. In the beta decay, the decay rate depends on the overlap of

the wave functions of the ground state of the parent and the state of the daughter.

The decay rate can be calculated using the Fermi’s Golden Rule :

λ =

2π
(cid:126) | (cid:104)Ψf inal|V |Ψinitial(cid:105) |2 ρ,

(10.2)

where V is a potential that causes the transition from the initial quantum state

Ψinitial(parent) to a ﬁnal quantum state Ψf inal, that include the wavefunctions of

the daughter nucleus, the electron and the neutrino and ρ is the density of the ﬁnal

state. The interaction found by Fermi between the electron and neutrino is called

weak interaction with a constant g (0.88× 10−4 MeV/fm3) to represent its strength.

This is approximately 10−3 of the electromagnetic force constant. To calculate the

transition probability from Fermi’s golden rule for 39Ar is diﬃcult, several assumptions

are made to simplify the calculation. First, the mass of neutrino is assumed to be

zero and the nucleus are treated as a point charge. In the large Z atom, the electron

screen correction need to be taken into account. When the negative beta particle

escape from the parent nucleus, it will be attracted and slowed down. This eﬀect

results in more low energy electrons are produced. In addition, the size of nucleus

is ﬁnite which aﬀects the statistical shape of the ﬁnal spectrum. These eﬀects are

CHAPTER 10. ENERGY SCALE CALIBRATION

213

incorporate by Fermi by using coulomb-distorted wave functions and are contained

in a spectrum distortion expression called the Fermi function. Moreover, for decays

that have a diﬀerence in spin between the parent and daughter nucleus of larger than

one angular momentum, the lepton must carry away the access angular momentum.

Assuming a decay occurs at the nuclear surface at r = 5 fm, with angular momentum

L of 1(cid:126), the energy can be written

L = rp =⇒ p =

(10.4)

This shows that the leptons are emitted preferentially with no orbital angular mo-

mentum. The lepton can still emitted with the angular momentum larger than 1.

However, the energy available to the leptons is constraint by the Q-value of the reac-

tion. It is possible that the leptons are emitted at large radii, however, the probability

of large radius emission is suppressed. As such, the largest beta decay rate happened

with L=0, the higher angular momentum emission is possible at the cost of small

probability or long lifetime. The conservation of angular momentum impose the fol-

lowing condition on the parity of the initial and the ﬁnal state

10.2 Simulation

To study the ﬁtting of 39Ar energy spectrum and extract the energy scale and res-

olution, 2 million 39Ar simulation events are produced using RAT. The trigger eﬃ-

ciency determined by simulation is 98%, the untriggered event mostly are produced

resolution. The true deposited energy is taken from MC and the detected energy

is from the sum of total PMT reconstructed charge multiplied by the PMT gain

(nominally 5 pC/mV) and divided by a nominal photon yield (YN ). The nominal

photon yield is calculated using theoretical value and multiply the detector eﬃciency

list in Table 10.2.

Figure 10.5 shows the schematic of procedure of the simulation. If the ﬁnal res-

olution is Gaussian and the process are independent of each other the total resolution

is quadruple sum of the resolution from each process. The energy resolution function

is derived from taken to be a Gaussian with mean

Where EM = 220 is the mean of the true energy spectrum and ﬁtted light yield is Y in

energy cancels. The parameters p0 and p1 have dimensions of keVee. The resolution

function is integrated over the theoretical spectrum, normalized to the number of

events (“norm”) to get the ﬁtting function. The energy spectrum from simulation is

then ﬁt to the four parameters ﬁtting function : normalization, bias, resolution σ and

yield. The ﬁtting results is shown in Fig. 10.6, the associated parameters is list in

Table 10.3.

In order to understand the ﬁtting, each process has been studied thoroughly

(Fig. 10.5). In the ﬁrst process, RAT assuming all the energy deposited by the inter-

action convert to the energy of corresponding photons. The VUV photons emission

is following the Poisson distribution with mean value of 40 photons/keV. To under-

stand the behavior in each energy bins, the bias and the energy resolution is plotted

as a function of energy. The bias is ﬁtted to ﬁrst order of polynomial function and

the resolution is ﬁtted to Eq. 10.10. The resolution plot seems to ﬁt well to the

Eq. 10.10 while the bias seems to behave non-linearly. This may due to the fact

that the process follows the Poisson distribution and approaches to Gaussian when

the statistics is high as shown in Fig. 10.8. The next process is the re-emission of

TPB as shown in the Fig. 10.9. The Gaussian ﬁt to each energy bin is shown in

Fig. 10.10. The events from long tail in Fig. 10.10 came from the events produced

near the baﬄes. Extracting the events which in the long tail and plot their true

position in the simulation. These events clearly from the position near the baﬄe as

shown in Fig. 10.11. Figure 10.12 shows the plot of the reconstructed radius versus

the MC true radius. These plot shows the events near the edge of baﬄe tend to be

mis-reconstructed. The Shellﬁt is based on the scintillation proﬁle of LAr, for events

are too close to the baﬄe, the reconstruction algorithm will have diﬃculty to handle

the reﬂection process correctly. Moreover, some photons may be absorbed in the baf-

ﬂe or escape from the active volume, results in mis-reconstructed radius and energy.

Figure. 10.13 shows the radius and angular distribution of events originate outside

The process of converting MC charge to reconstructed charge is done by simu-

of the simulated DAQ system. The last step is to convert the reconstructed charge

reconstructed near some PMTs which has large PMT gain as shown in Fig. 10.18.

For example PMT 74 has gain of 14 pC compare to the nominal gain of 5 pC. This

create the excessive energy compare to the input reconstructed energy.

The low energy part of spectrum of Fig. 10.6 has slightly excessive events. This

may be explained by above discussion. The baﬄe events tend to be under-estimate,

create a excessive events in low energy region of the spectrum. However, the χ2/NDF

bias and resolution as a function of reconstructed radius can be investigated. Figure

correctly and has under-estimated energy. Nevertheless, with real data from LAr,

made to ﬁt the 39Ar energy spectrum in cold gas. However, it is diﬃcult to get a

good ﬁt due to the following reasons.

1. The density of cold gas is around 0.006 g/cm2 which is nearly three order of

magnitude less than liquid (1.394 g/cm2). The observed events decreased cor-

respondingly.

2. Due to the low density, the electron emitted by 39Ar beta decay close to the edge

will escape from of active volume results in non-detected events. This distort

the energy spectrum.

3. There are 28 PMTs are deactivated, which reduces the PMT coverage.

4. The contribution from internal β/γ background to the electronic recoil is indis-

tinguishable. This will not be a problem in liquid due to high 39Ar beta decay

rates and increased density.

The ﬁrst point can be simply calculated using the density of gas/liquid argon. In

the gaseous argon, the total mass of gas is 2.29 kg which gives the rate of 39Ar beta

decay of 2.29 Hz. However, with the liquid, the rate is around 500 Hz even without

the 39 spike injection. The statistics of the 39Ar energy spectrum in the cold gas

is way smaller than in the liquid, which gives large error on ﬁtting results. As for

point two, it can be seen in the simulation that the electron originated near the edge

will have large probability to escape without been detected. Figure 10.21 shows the

energy of electron as a function of radius ratio cubed. In the liquid, the triggered

events should be uniformly distributed according to the radius cubed, however, in the

gas there are very few high energy events are detected. Moreover, the excessive low

energy events are caught at the edge indicating the high energy events which originate

closer to the center of the detector just deposit partial energy in the detector. The

maximum distance which electrons can travel in the gaseous argon is deﬁned by CSDA

(continuous-slowing-down-approzimation) and gives 58 cm. The diameter of the IV

active volume is 90 cm, thus agree with the simulation. Figure 10.22 shows cutting

the events which close to the edge results in eliminating the low energy events with

high energy events stay the same. Moreover, the reducing PMT coverage cost some

by simulation. However, the pressure and the temperature of the IV is changing while

taking data. This creates the inhomogeneity in the IV which is hard to be model

correctly in the simulation. Figure 10.23 shows the angular distribution for both cold

gas data and simulation. In the data, a group of events are reconstructed near the top

and bottom while in the simulation, the pattern is not seen. Finally the background

from the internal β/γ which originate from the radioactive impurities of detector

material will create the same electronic recoil. With reduction of PMT coverage, the

shellﬁt can not reconstructed these events correctly. These indistinguishable events

will further distort the energy spectrum of 39Ar beta decay. However, due to the

self shielding in the liquid argon, the ﬁtting of energy spectrum can be done with a

proper radius cut. Figure 10.24 shows the simulated beta-deay energy spectrum in

liquid and cold gas which displays the distorted energy spectrum of the gas compare

to the normal spectrum in the liquid. Figure 10.25 shows the comparison of charge

distribution between real data and the simulation.

In the data, more low energy

event presented, this may due to the inhomogeneity of the gas such that high energy

electron deposit less energy than expected in the simulation. Moreover, low energy

gamma (< 40 keV) can also contribute to the charge distribution. The attenuation

length for gamma particle with energy of 30 keV is 62 cm, which could only deposit

its partial energy in the gaseous argon.

Conclusion

Currently MiniCLEAN detector is in the cooling phase (Aug. 2017) and we expect

to start ﬁlling the detector with LAr within a month. The preliminary operation in

cold gas revealed several dysfunctional PMTs which are summarized in Chapter 9.1.1.

Nonetheless, some PMTs with low gain could be recovered after oﬃcial commissioning

and the PMTs without conformal coating should also perform normally in LAr. For

the In-situ optical calibration system, several LEDs are not functioning normaly, only

three blue LEDs with measurable impedance. We suspect these are the results when

the detector warming unexpectedly fast during the incident described in Chapter 4.3.

We infer that the cable were loosened or the electrical connection broken. We perform

a MC simulation to evaluate the reduced detector performance compare to the full

performance[134]. Ten thousand of 39Ar events were produced to conﬁrm the light

yield and the position reconstruction performance under the reduced PMT coverage.

Figure 11.1 shows the reduction of the photoelectrons with only 82 PMTs coverage.

The MC simulation indicates the 11.5% reduction on light yield and 14% reduction in

resolution of position reconstruction as shown in Fig. 11.2. After the commissioning,

the full performance can be estimate by extrapolate the results from MC simulation.

The minimum cross-section limit from MiniCLEAN is estimated to be 9×10−45

cm2 at a 94 GeV WIMP mass.

It is about 2 order of magnitude larger than the

current best results. However, the 39Ar spike runs allow us to study the limit of PSD

and the light yield ﬁtting from 39Ar energy spectrum. Figure 11.3 shows the leakage

probability of electronic recoil (PSD capability) as a function of energy threshold.

This plot shows that with 150 kg LAr in ﬁducial volume and expected light yield of

6 p.e./keV, and if the PSD rejection ability reaches 10−10 level , the MiniCLEAN will

have demonstrated what could be achieved in a 1-ton detector. This extraordinary

PSD background rejection ability suggests that a single phase LAr detector would be

competitive for with other techniques for a dark matter WIMP search.

Magnetic Compensation Sensors

A.1 Description of device

The magnetic sensor is designed to measure the magnetic ﬁeld strength inside the

water tank and the results is used to determine the nominal current in magnetic com-

pensation coils. The other important application of sensors is PMT gain calibration.

The PMT gain is aﬀected by the magnetic ﬁeld. In order to optimize the PMT per-

formance, we need to know the ﬁeld strength around the PMT and adjust the gain

accordingly.

The sensor boards were custom made at UNM(Fig. A.1). These are based on the

HMC1001(1D) and HMC1002 (2D) magnetoresistive sensor ICs. For each channel,

1 magnetoresistive Wheatstone bridge made of ferromagnetic resistors and a coil to

set the initial magnetization of the sensitive elements. The sensor board is contained

in a PVC case made of an asymmetric T for plumbing, with the 2 wider extremities

closed by caps, and a PVC tube connected to the third by way of spigot. The PVC

tube is designed to be water tight and has been tested in the water. The wire bundle

from the board is a 3M 10 wire ribbon, which exists the case through the spigot, and

runs in a transparent and ﬂexible PVC tube up to water surface.

Test Studying Mitigation of Oxygen

Deﬁciency Hazards

B.1 introduction

MiniCLEAN detector holds ∼ 500 kg liquid argon located at Cube Hall in the SNO-

Lab. If there’s any unexpected situation e.g. overpressure or seismic events happened

such that the insulation system failed. Huge amount of liquid argon will boil-oﬀ in

very short time, these argon gases are heavier than oxygen, so that at the bottom of

Cube Hall the oxygen will be repel and create oxygen deﬁciency hazards. A series of

tests were perform to understand if the mitigation of oxygen-deﬁciency hazards in the

Cube Hall was suﬃcient to handle the situation of upset conditions in MiniCLEAN.

B.2 Oxygen Sensors

During the tests, the oxygen sensors used to monitoring the oxygen level in cube

hall are from the SNOLab ﬁxed oxygen sensors and a pair of portable logging sensor.

The ﬁxed sensors located in the Cube Hall are constantly monitoring the oxygen

concentration, the value of sensors are read out by the SNOLAB Building Automation

241

APPENDIX B. TEST STUDYING MITIGATION OF OXYGEN DEFICIENCY HAZARDS242

System (BAS). All the BAS and data are achived to the SNOLAB PI server which

is read-only copy of the BAS Historian database. Before the test, we go through

every sensors and check its functionality. A bag with pure nitrogen or argon covers

the sensor until the sensor read less than 1% oxygen. Subsequently, the bag and gas

supply are removed quickly. The rate of decreasing oxygen level were then determined.

Based on the order in which the sensors were read out the wiring and addressing was

double checked to ensure data integrity. The readout of the ﬁxed sensors is done

using a 4-20 mA circuit analog output from the sensors. The time stamps of the

measurement are from the BAS system.

A long-life zirconium oxide cell was used in the sensor with a range of 0 to

25%. The device is sensitive to the airﬂow and be cooled by it results in inaccuracy.

The ventilation system in SNOLAB changes the readout value by 0.1%. The BAS

database only readout the value when oxygen level changes, this is inconvenient for

doing the data analysis. Therefore it was changed to readout the value every 10

seconds after the ﬁrst tests. On the other hand, the portable sensors log data every

10 seconds. The readout software is from Dr¨ager hardware and software. However,

there’s no a priori guarantee of clock synchronization between the PAC7000 units and

the ﬁxed sensors.

B.3 Sensor Comparisons

In oder to compare the sensors properly they need to be exposed to the same at-

mosphere with a various bumps to the oxygen level. The sensors were placed in a

rectangular bucket of approximately 50-L volume and the top was covered except for

a small feed through on the opposite side as shown in Fig. B.1. The rectangular

box was covered with a ﬂexible plastic bag and sealed carefully on all sides with alu-

minum tape. Nitrogen gas was introduced through a long 1/4" tube with a vale and

APPENDIX B. TEST STUDYING MITIGATION OF OXYGEN DEFICIENCY HAZARDS243

the digital display of the sensors were monitored throughout the test.

During the ﬁrst comparison (Fig. B.2)the nitrogen gas was introduced quickly

into the volume and then the room air allowed to mix back in slowly through the

opening (occationally with fanning or tapping the cover). The oxygen concentration

decreasing curve follows a near-perfect exponential curve indicating the mixing in the

volume.However, the portable sensors retuened to 20.9% in a jump from 20.6% or

20.7%. Note that the ﬁxed sensor remained at a slightly diminished value of 20.7%.

This diminished value is more credible given how the end of the test was carried out.

A similar behavior was seen in the second test, the nitrogen gas was introduced at low

concentrations. This time the nitrogen being added slowly and the portable sensors

do not show a value below 20.9% until they have reached 20.3%. The portable sensors

jump from 20.4% on the recovery side of the test (Fig. B.3).

To understand the eﬀects comes from the time delay or purely a response function

to charges in concentration, the experiment was repeated. This time we add the

nitrogen more slowly than previous tests. Figure B.4 shows the oxygen concentration

as a function of time. Note that the small initial burst was introduced intentionally

to synchronize clocks between sensors. The same behavior was observed, the portable

sensor do not show a value below 30.9% until they have reached 20.3%. Although the

time scale for this test is much longer than the previous test, the jump in portable

sensors still occurred at the same concentration.

In summary, several characteristic of the sensors response were observed :

• The reading from portable PAC7000 and PureAire ﬁxed sensors agree with each

other for oxygen concentration belows 20.5%.

• The clocks in the PAC7000 units are not guaranteed to be synced with the

ﬁxed units. Thus absolute time between the two PAC7000 units or between a

PAC7000 unit and ﬁxed sensor is not to be trusted unless the calibrated during

that particular test.

APPENDIX B. TEST STUDYING MITIGATION OF OXYGEN DEFICIENCY HAZARDS244

• If the reading from portabl PAC700 reads 20.9%, it should be interpreted as

reporting between 20.3% and 20.9%.

B.4 Test in Cube Hall – Overview

A series of tests carried out in the diﬀerent location in Cube Hall to understand the

impact of oxygen deﬁciency hazards. Figure B.5 shows the ventilation route and the

volume of each area in the Cube Hall. First two tests were performed at the staging

area which is at the top of cube hall. The third test was carried out on the deck which

is on top of MiniCLEAN water tank. The rest of tests were carried out in various

location at ﬂoor level. Table B.1 summarize the tests and Fig. B.6 shows some of the

location described above. These area will be deﬁned as Oxygen Deﬁciency Hazards

Area (ODHA) if the oxygen level is less than 19.5%. However, SNOLab is 6,800

ft underground, the measured atmosphere pressure in SNOLAB is 17.3 psia (1.18

atm or 895 Torr). Thus under such pressure, if the oxygen level drops below 13.5%,

should people starts to have symptoms due to lack of oxygen. During the spill test,

all personnel retreat to outside of Cube Hall for safety, and control the test through

online system. The primary ventilation is from air handler 7 (at 14,000 cfm ∼ 6.608

m3/s). Two additional fans (670 cfm) in staging area and three fans (5700 cfm) on

the ﬂoor level were installed to improve the air ﬂow. The staging area is a open space

that connects to the top of the Cube Hall. No barrier between the staging area and

the Cube Hall, therefore the air can mix with Nitrogen/Argon gas freely. A 1000 cfm

fan was installed in the staging area to help the air mixing. The Main Hall Access

Drift (MHAD) connects the rest of SNOLAB to the staging/CubeHall. The air space

are separated by ﬁre doors and the MHAD is at lower pressure than the Cube Hall,

forcing the air through the unsealed door during the normal operation. This design

is to prevent the contamination get into the Cube Hall from the outside environment.

The Bottom Access Drift (BAD) connects to both the bottom of the Cube Hall and

Cryopit. It is at lower pressure than Cube Hall and Cryopit as well thus the air from

the Cube Hall/Cryopit moves through the ﬁre doors into the BAD.

B.5 First and Second Test in Cube Hall : With Cube

Hall Recirculation On

The ﬁrst test was performed on Sep. 15 2014. For the ﬁrst test a spill was eﬀected in

the Cube hall staging area. The SNOLAB ventilation was on circulating air within

the Cube Hall (drawing from the staging area and distributing along the east wall)

at a rate of approximately 14000 cfm. The fresh-air intake into the Cube Hall was

turned oﬀ for the test. The DEAP clean tent had its ventilation left on for the test.

Thus pulled air from the ﬂoor of the cube hall behind the tanks near the argon dewar

into the clean tent and out the door of the clean tent. The fans were all at ﬂoor level.

The total amount of nitrogen dispensed from the dewar was approximately

154kg. Of that approximately 50 kg accumulated in the catch basin and did not

produce vapour during the test. (The amount that did not produce vapour is impre-

cise because the catch basin contained both liquid nitrogen and water ice. The total

volume was estimated with a dip stick but the ice fraction was visually estimated

APPENDIX B. TEST STUDYING MITIGATION OF OXYGEN DEFICIENCY HAZARDS249

to be 25% of the material in the catch basin.) Thus the total boil oﬀ was approxi-

mately 105 kg. At STP this corresponds to 84 m3. The total volume of the Cube

Hall (including the volume of the shielding tanks is approximately 5700 m3. Thus

approximately 1.47% of the air is displaced with pure nitrogen. Given that air is

20.9% oxygen we expect the oxygen concentration to drop by 0.3% on average.

The second test was carried out on Sep. 16 2014. The same procedure with ﬁrst

test was performed but with slight larger spill rate and the ventilation was oﬀ to test

extreme situation.

The spill test was carried out near the downstream side of sensor 3. Figure B.7

shows the average spill rate was 57 g/s. The portable sensors are brought close to the

test site. One was approximately 30 cm oﬀ the ﬂoor and 2 meters high for the other.

Both sensors shows 20.9% of oxygen level which implies the true level of oxygen is at

or above 20.4%. Figure B.8 shows the reading from ﬁxed oxygen sensors, note that the

sensor 3 is the nearest sensor to the test site. The height of sensor 3 is approximately

chest height and the spill was below that level. During the ﬁrst test, the SNOLAB

ventilation work as expected and average out the ODH throughout the Cube Hall.

Each sensors just dropped between 0.25% and 0.3 % and is closed to expectations.

The oxygen concentration at any place in the Cube Hall is always above 20% except

within 1 meter from the spill site.

In second test, the locations of sensors are the same with the ﬁrst test. The

oxygen concentration in Cube Hall except the staging area reads very similar readings

with ﬁrst test. However, for sensors located at staging area as shown in Fig. B.9

dropped below 20%. This conﬁrmed that the ventilation system help to push nitrogen

to ﬂow to some other space in Cube Hall and mixed with air. Without the ventilation

on, the air takes longer time to mix with nitrogen in staging area and nitrogen did

not fully mix with the air in the Cube Hall. Nevertheless, the oxygen level still far

from the dangerous level (13.8%), indicating that the personnel still would be safe to

APPENDIX B. TEST STUDYING MITIGATION OF OXYGEN DEFICIENCY HAZARDS250

work in the area.

Figure B.7: The mass of the liquid-nitrogen dewar. The sloped shows a dispensing
rate of 57 g/s. the eﬀective vapor generation rate was lower as some liquid accumu-
lated in the spill container as discussed in the text. The average vapor generation
rate was approximately 40 g/s.

B.6 Third Test in Cube Hall : With Cube Hall Re-

circulation On

The third test was carried out on the MinCLEAN side of the Cube Hall deck. The

SNOLAB ventilation system was oﬀ but ODH fans were on except the fan near the

MiniCLEAN which is uninstalled at the moment. The liquid nitrogen was decanted

from a 230 L dewar as quickly as possible. The portable oxygen sensors were installed

in two locations : one approximately 5 feet above the deck and 1 foot above the deck

for the other. Both sensors were placed near the spill site with approximately 1.5

meters from it. Soon after the test starts, one irregularity was found. Through the

camera which installed for monitoring the test, found that some liquid nitrogen was

missing the spill container. The test was halted for a few minutes and a block was put

in place to direct the spill into the bucket. To add heat to the nitrogen a peristaltic

pump dripped water at a 240 mL/minute onto the stream of nitrogen from the hose.

There was no accumulation of nitrogen in the spill bucket.

The spill rate is about 70 g/s as shown in Fig. B.10. Figure B.11 shows the

sensors which has large changes. Note that the sensor 5 is the nearest sensor to the

spill site but has only a alight reaction to the test. Instead, the ﬁrst response is from

sensor 7 which is located on a post supporting the deck approximately 4 feet above

the ﬂoor at the corner below the spill site. This may due to the air ﬂow forcing by

the ODH fans. During the test, no sensors has dropped below 20 %.

was a genuine short pause to ﬁx a problem. The spill rate shown does not include

B.7 Fourth Test in Cube Hall : With Cube Hall Re-

circulation Oﬀ

In this test, more rapid spill rate was test on the ﬂoor level of Cube Hall. The 106

kg of liquid nitrogen was decanted into an open container. A volume of water was

placed in a nearby container and pumped into the nitrogen at > 2 liter/s causing the

nitrogen to boil-oﬀ in less than a minutes. During the test, the SNOLAB ventilation

was oﬀ. Two of the three large Cube Hall ODH fans were on as were one ODH fan

on deck, one at the argon dewar and one at the staging area. Figure B.12 shows the

setup of the test.

The three sensors on the Cube Hall ﬂoor are 6, 7, and 8. Note that 8 is closest

to the spill and shows a large eﬀect. Note that in fact sensor 6 showed a signal before

sensor 7 despite the general sense of the air ﬂow suggesting 7 would see the event

ﬁrst. However, the clean tent provided an almost straight-line path for gas to go from

the spill site to sensor 6. (The door of the clean tent on the spill side is open and at

the back of the clean tent there is a large area of fans with HEPA ﬁlters.) The plot

of these sensors are shown in Fig B.13. After approximately 10 minutes, all sensors

went back to above 20% of oxygen concentration.

B.8 Fifth and Sixth Test in Cube Hall : With Cube

Hall Recirculation Oﬀ

The ﬁfth test was carried out on Sep 25. 2014. Th location of the test is on ﬂoor level

and right behind the DEAP water tank as shown in Fig. B.14. The procedure is the

same as fourth test. The LN2 spill rate is at 68 g/s. More ODH fans were installed

on ﬂoor level of Cube Hall to help the air mixing. The oxygen level of sensors are

well above 20.5% throughout the test except the portable sensors just next to the

Figure B.12: The ﬂoor of the Cube Hall at the time of the test. Note that the steel
shell impeded air ﬂow on the ﬂoor. Each of the three fans behind the steel shell on
the wall are rated to 5700 cfm. Two were on for this test. The liquid nitrogen was
displaced into an insulated bucket behind the liquid-nitrogen dewar. The portable
air sensors are mounted on the tripod, one about 1 foot oﬀ the ﬂoor and the other
about 5 feet oﬀ the ﬂoor.

spill site. The readings of ﬁxed sensors is shown in Fig. B.15.

The sixth test is the same with ﬁfth, only this time we were using LAr and spill

with faster rate (∼ 204 g/s). The test was carried out on Oct. 2 2014. No sensors

dropped below 13.8 %. However, with faster spill rate, the mixing of the air is slower

than previous test. Figure B.16 shows the reading from various sensors. Note that

the vertical mixing didn’t take place until the ventilation came back on. Nonetheless,

the oxygen level still well above 18 %.

B.9 Seventh Test in Cube Hall : With Cube Hall

Recirculation Oﬀ

The seventh test take place on the ﬂoor level and right on front of MiniCLEAN water

tank as shown in Fig. B.17. This test is to simulate the worst case scenario when huge

amount of LAr boil-oﬀ very rapidly (∼ 2185 g/s). Note that the diﬀerence between

test the the worst case of scenario is that the area and volume of the Cube Hall is

larger in the test because the water tank is open. Moreover, the gas was produced at

the ﬂoor level instead of just below the deck. The sensors on the ﬂoor level shows that

the initial fast mixing on less than one minute time scale. However, the stratiﬁcation

of argon prevents complete mixing in the Cube Hall thus the hazardous condition will

develop over time. The readings of the sensor as a function of time are shown in Fig.

B.18.

B.10 Conclusion

After a series of tests, it reveal the time of mixing with air needs to be improved.

The ODH fans (5000 cfm) were added in the Cube Hall to help the vertical mixing

and mitigate the oxygen deﬁciency hazards. Therefore in any scenario, the estimated

fatalities per hour is less than 10−7 with the current setup of Cube Hall. The work

Waveform Reduction in RAT

C.1 Overview

In light of dedicated Ar39 spike runs, the data reduction level is crucial for DAQ

system to handle the event trigger rate over 500 Hz. The two basic data reduction

level set by hardware (WFD) are : zero-supressed waveform and full waveform which

can just be set on run by run basis. Then the DAQ pass theses events along to

data reduction PC for further reduction on event by event basis. In DCDAQ, the

DecisionMaker may call a piece of code in RAT called Software Trigger to assign

reduction level based on three criteria.

1. Total ADC counts in the event

2. (An estimate of) fprompt

3. Maximum charge seen in a single PMT

Threshold for each of these quantities can be set in either DAQ.ratdb or during the

run conﬁguration in the macro. It is also possible to conﬁgure a run with all events

set to the same reduction level. In the end of process, each event will has a "data

type" integer that identiﬁes its reduction level. Each data reduction level is brieﬂy

261

described below.

1. Zero-supressed waveform :

• Reduction Level : : CHAN_ZLE_WAVEFORM = 2.

• Saves full ADC counts within each ’"ZLE window".

• Data consists of Waveform Blocks (one for each ZLE window).

• Each Waveform Block contains :

– Start time ( uint32_t)

– End time (uint32_t)

– ADC values (uint16_t)

– Example waveform : Fig. C.1 (a)

2. ZLE Integral Reduction Level

• Reduction Level : : CHAN_ZLE_INTEGRAL = 3.

• Saves full ADC integral for each ’"ZLE window".

• Data consists of Integral Blocks.

• Each Integral Block contains :

– Start time ( uint16_t)

– Width (uint8_t)

– Integral (ﬂoat)

– Example waveform : C.1 (b)

3. Prompt/Total Reduction Level

• Reduction Level : : CHAN_PROMPT_TOTAL = 4.

• Saves ADC integral for prompt region and whole event window.

APPENDIX C. WAVEFORM REDUCTION IN RAT

263

• Data consists of PromptTotal Blocks.

• Each PromptTotal Block contains :

– Prompt integral (ﬂoat)

– Total integral (ﬂoat)

– Example waveform : Fig. C.1 (c)

4. Full Waveforms

• This is not a reduction level; it is a WFD setting.

• Not done on an event by event basis – A whole run must be zero-supressed

or not.

• Data consists of PromptTotal Blocks.

• The whole event window will be treated as one big ZLE window by DC-

DAQ.

• Example Waveform : Fig. C.1 (d)

C.2 Bitwise operation

The software trigger using bitwise operation to assign the correct reduction level to

each event base on the predeﬁned criteria in DAQ.ratdb.

In the beginning of the

process, all events are assumed as ZLE_PromptTotal waveform. Then the processor

will use the preliminary values on adc counts, fprompt and maxQ to test if this event

pass the criteria. This process is implemented using bitwise operation. We use the

" trigger " word as our test bit and initialized it to 3. The pass bit is set to power

of 2 to avoid possible conﬂiction. For every 100 events we force the processor to

assign Zero-supressed waveform to the given event. The same is true for every 100

events passed charge cut , prompt Q cut and maxQ cut. The threshold value of each

discrimination parameters are in DAQ.ratdb, user can change values as they see ﬁt.

Currently the criteria for Sofware tigger to assign reduction level are following :

1. CHAN_ZLE_WAVEFORM

(a) PassPromptQ is true

(b) PassIntQ is true

(c) PassDSRcuts is true

2. CHAN_ZLE_INTEGRAL

(a) Either one of PassPromptQ and PassIntQ is false

3. CHAN_ZLE_INTEGRAL

(a) Both of PassPromptQ and PassIntQ are false

C.3 Decision Maker

As described in previous section, the software trigger processor will sort events into

these reduction level base on the parameters. For events which has been identiﬁed as

ZLE_PROMPT_TOTAL or ZLE_INTEGRAL, the samples in the blocks will be discarded and

just keep the information on total charge and the start and end time of the block. The

issue happened when the events identiﬁed as ZLE_INTEGRAL waveform1, the FPrompt

processor will gives unreasonable value on fprompt (Fig. C.2). This happens because

for the blocks came in at boundary of start and end of prompt window, the charge

inside the prompt window are miscalculated results in bizarre fprompt value. To ﬁx

this, one can get the charge in each bins in the block, and deduce the portion of

the bin that came in inside the prompt window to get prompt charge (Fig. C.3).

However, since we throw the samples away, we don’t have any means to get exact

1Reduction Level and waveform sometimes are interchangeable.

calibrated time, also the pulse is not evenly distribute throughout the block which

results in artiﬁcially larger late charge(Fig. C.4).

User should aware of this issue but should not worry about it. The threshold value

for each parameters to decide the reductional level can be modiﬁed in DAQ.ratdb

table. This way when doing the data analysis, user can optimal the threshold value

of the parameter to dump unwanted events.
