Abstract

We demonstrate the extensive study on how ﬁlm density and crystallinity of molybdenum carbide

(M oCx) can be tailored during plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) by controlling either the plasma

exposure time or the ion energy. We investigated M oCx ﬁlms grown using M o(tBuN )2(N M e2)2

as the precursor and H2/Ar plasma as the co-reactant at temperatures between 150◦C and 300◦C.

We discover a threshold for graphitic layer formation at high mean ion energies during the PEALD

cycle. The supplied high energy dose allows for hybridised sp2 carbon bonds formation, similar to

high temperature annealing. The graphitisation of the M oCx surface takes place at temperature

of 300◦C. The graphitic ﬁlm show a (101) plane diﬀraction peak with dominant intensity in XRD,

and a typical sp2 C1s peak along with carbidic metal in XPS measurements. Surface roughness

of the ﬁlm lowers signiﬁcantly at the graphitisation regime of deposition. This low temperature

graphitisation by high energy plasma ions during PEALD shows a great promise to advancing

graphene and graphite composites at low temperature by PEALD for future applications.

INTRODUCTION

Graphene and graphitic based composites are of great interest in research of next gener-

ation electronics, protective layer coatings, and ﬂexible electronics [1, 2]. Transition metal

of group IV-VI have shown to be highly suitable for the high temperature CVD graphene

growth process due to its thermal stability, and low thermal coeﬃcient matching Si sub-

strates [3] These characteristics result in lower graphene ﬁlm stress, as the mismatch between

graphene and underlying catalytic substrate is signiﬁcantly reduced. molybdenum carbide

(M oCx) is a refractory metal carbide compound that combines the physical properties of ce-

ramics and the electrical properties of metals, with hardness and mechanical strength (300 -

535 GPa), high thermal stability, chemical inertness and a metallic like electrical conductiv-

ity [4, 5]. The atomic radii ratio of carbon to molybdenum of 0.556 makes it highly suitable

to form interstitial carbides with a mixture of covalent, ionic and metallic bonds between

the metal and the carbon atoms which are responsible for its unique set of properties [4].

These characteristics are of great interest for diﬀusion barriers in ICs, superconductors and

various MEMS applications. Furthermore, molybdenum carbide has made a new addition

to the 2D material family named MXenes [6]. As an IC diﬀusion barrier M oCx is ideally

amorphous and dense, while for superconductivity the cubic δ − M oC0.75 shows the highest

transition temperature (14.3 K) [7] for M oCx ﬁlms.

In order to accommodate the broad spectrum of usage, the ability to separately control

the crystallinity and density of M oCx would be an asset for tailoring ﬁlm properties to the

speciﬁc application needs. Thus far, various techniques have been implemented to synthesize

cubic M oCx, such as high energy ion bombardment of amorphous MoC, CVD, PVD and

ultra high pressure synthesis, at high temperatures [8–10]. While some techniques were

successful in the synthesis, the high temperatures required make it unsuitable for integration

in temperature sensitive devices.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) oﬀers a cyclic soft deposition technique with a broad and

low temperature window, submonolayer thickness control due to its self limiting nature,

along with high uniformity and conformality. These merits allow for deposition on temper-

ature sensitive applications as well as for deposition of layers sensitive for the kinetic ion

impact during sputtering.

While substantial work has been done on various molybdenum compounds such as molyb-

2

denum oxide [11] and nitride , so far, very little work has been done on ALD of M oCx.
Recently, a PEALD process using M o(tBuN )2(N M e2)2 precursor with a H2/N2 plasma as

co-reactant was developed with the aim of achieving low resistivity ﬁlms [12]. Bertuch et al.

demonstrated the deposition of a range of M oCx − M oCxNy compounds depending on the

H2/N2 ratios used. A predominantly molybdenum carbide material with nitrogen impuri-
ties was produced with pure H2 plasma at 150 ◦C, which showed the lowest (170 µΩ − cm)

resistivity. Here, we present the ﬁrst extensive study on how ﬁlm density and crystallinity

of M oCx can be tailored independently during plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) by control-

ling either the plasma exposure time or the ion energy [13–15]. We investigated M oCx ﬁlms
grown using (tBuN )2(N M e2)2M o as the precursor and H2/Ar plasma as the co-reactant
at temperatures between 150◦C and 300◦C. Additionally, we present the eﬀects of enhanc-

ing the impinging ion energy on the physical and chemical properties of M oCx thin ﬁlms,

controlled via RF biasing of the substrate table during the plasma step of the PEALD.

We discover a threshold for graphitic layer formation at high mean ion energies during the

PEALD cycle. While plasma assisted graphene fabrication has attracted signiﬁcant interest

due to the low temperature synthesis [16], to the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report

of nano graphitic layers formation at low temperature using PEALD.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

M oCx thin ﬁlms have been deposited by plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition

(PEALD) at various temperatures and plasma conditions.

In this part the deposition

process is explained and the analysis techniques described.

A. Film depositions

Plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition was performed on 100 mm Si (100) wafers

coated with 450 nm of thermally grown SiO2. The depositions were performed in an Oxford

instruments FlexAL2 ALD reactor, which is equipped with an inductively coupled remote

RF plasma (ICP) source (13.56 MHz) with alumina dielectric tube. The reactor was pumped

down to a base pressure of 1 · 10−6T orr with a turbomolecular pump. The samples were

loaded and unloaded from a low pressure loadlock chamber, allowing for a cooldown after

deposition in vacuum conditions. The reactor’s deposition table was set to temperatures

between 150◦C and 300◦C, and the wall temperature to 150◦C.

One ALD cycle consists of subsequently a precursor dose step, a purge step, a plasma

exposure step and again a purge step. The (M o(tBuN )2(N M e2)2 precursor (98%, Strem
Chemicals) was stored in a stainless steel container, which was kept at 50 ◦C. The precursor

container was bubbled by an argon ﬂow of 50 sccm during the precursor dose step, while

ﬂowing argon at the same rate from the ICP chamber to avoid deposition in the ICP tube.

The total pressure in the reactor during the 6 seconds long precursor injection was set to 200

mTorr. During the plasma exposure step, the ICP RF power was set to 100W. H2/Ar with

4:1 ratio and total ﬂow rate of 50 sccm was fed from the top ICP tube and the plasma was

ignited for the desired exposure time, typically 20 to 80 seconds. Automatic pressure control

(APC) valves were fully opened during plasma exposure to reduce the pressure to 7 mTorr.

Purge steps (4 to 5 seconds) were set after precursor and plasma half cycles to evacuate

residual precursor gas, reaction byproducts and plasma species with 100 sccm argon ﬂow

and open APC valves, at pressure 25 mTorr.

B. Film analyses

Film thickness and optical properties of the deposited ﬁlms have been studied with a

J.A. Woollam UV-spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE) using a model comprising one Drude and

two Tauc-Lorenz oscillators. Data was obtained within the range of 190 nm – 990 nm,

and refractive index (n) and extinction coeﬃcient (k) were determined. Growth per cycle

(GPC) was calculated using in-situ J.A. Woollam IR-SE every 10 deposition cycles. Optical

resistivity was derived from the ﬁrst term of the Drude oscillator, corresponding to the

imaginary part (cid:15)2.

Sheet resistance values of the M oCx ﬁlms deposited on 450 nm SiO2/Si were determined

using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter and a Signatron probe. Film thickness was evaluated

using ex-situ UV-SE, to calculate the electrical resistivity at room temperature.

The ﬁlm composition was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with

a Thermo Scientiﬁc KA1066 spectrometer, using monochromatic Al Kα x-rays with an

energy of 1486.6 eV. The ﬁlms have been sputtered with Ar+ ion gun prior to scans, in

order to remove surface oxide and adventitious carbon. A continuous electron ﬂood gun

was employed during measurements to compensate for charging. XPS studies have been

performed to evaluate the ﬁlm composition as function of plasma conditions. Three main

components were evaluated by their corresponding peaks, namely molybdenum by the mo3d

peak, oxygen by the O1s peak and carbon by the C1s peak. The ratio between each peak area

4

Preprint

Preprint

to the sum of all peaks area gave the partial atomic percentage of the element. The precursor

molecule used for deposition contains 4 nitrogen atoms bonded to the molybdenum atom,

therefore nitrogen is expected to be found in the ﬁlm. However, due to overlapping N1s and

Mo3p peaks, deconvolution of the N1s peak is not reliable for low N1s peak intensity.

Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and elastic recoil detection (ERD) were

performed by AccTec BV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, using a Singletron with a 2 MeV

He+ beam to determine the chemical composition of the ﬁlms. ERD was performed with the

detector at a recoil angle of 30◦. RBS is performed at scattering angles of 150◦ and 105◦. The

mass density was calculated using the measured mass density as obtained from RBS/ERD

measurements and the ﬁlm thickness as obtained from SE. RBS measurement complement

the XPS estimation of ﬁlm composition, and speciﬁcally provide further information on

nitrogen content in the ﬁlm.

Film crystallinity and preferred crystal orientation was studied by Gonio x-ray diﬀraction.

Experiments were conducted with PanAnlytical X’pert PROMRD diﬀractometer operated

using CuKα(λ = 1.54A). A JEOL ARM 200 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at

200 kV was used to analyse the microstructure of ﬁlms deposited on planar TEM windows.

These windows consisted of ∼ 15 nm Si3N4 membranes coated with 5 nm of SiO2 grown

using ALD. This ensured a SiO2 starting surface while maintaining transparency to the

electron beam. High-angle-annular-dark-ﬁeld TEM (HAADF-TEM) modes was employed

to characterise the samples.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Atomic layer ﬁlm deposition has been performed with M o(tBuN )2(N M e2)2 precursor

and 40/10 sccm of H2/Ar plasma. The growth per cycle (GPC) was measured with an

in-situ SE by measuring the ﬁlm’s thickness every 10 cycles. Precursor saturation occurs

after 6 seconds of dosing, and plasma time saturation after 20 seconds of exposure. The

saturation curve for the precursor and the plasma time performed at 300◦C is presented in
ﬁgure 1. Typical saturated GPC value is 0.365˚A. The eﬀect of temperature on the GPC in

saturated conditions has been studied as well for 150◦C and 250◦C yielding values of about
0.25˚A(see ﬁgure 2). The signiﬁcant increase in GPC at 300◦C has been explained elsewhere

[11] as precursor decomposition. However, we see no evidence to that eﬀect, as the precursor

5

saturation curve conﬁrms no increase in GPC after 6 seconds dosing. Furthermore, ﬁlm

thickness as measured across a wafer with ex-situ SE, show high uniformity typical for ALD.

Additionally, previous work in our group using the same precursor for M oOx deposition

showed no decomposition at the same table temperature [12].The characterisation of the

M oCx properties with varying temperature provides an insight to observed rise in GPC.

A. Plasma Time and Temperature eﬀects on Films

M oCx depositions at 150◦C with 20 seconds plasma have produced ﬁlms with C/Mo ratio

of 0.7 as estimated by XPS (see table I). The oxygen content was estimated to be 12.4% at

150◦C with 20 seconds plasma. Increasing the plasma exposure time to 80 seconds shows a

slight decrease in C/Mo ratio to 0.68 with a sharp decrease of oxygen content to 5.7%, as

demonstrated in ﬁgure 3. The growth per cycle (GPC) for both cases remains unchanged at
0.25˚A. All ﬁlms deposited at 150◦C show no diﬀraction peaks in XRD measurements and are

deemed to be completely amorphous. Deposition at 250◦C with 20 seconds plasma produced

a ﬁlm with 5% hydrogen, 5% nitrogen and C/Mo ratio of 0.63, however no [O] was detected

in the bulk. Hydrogen content could originate both from the plasma coreactant gas, and

the [H] rich precursor molecule, while nitrogen content originates solely from the precursor

molecule, C12H30N4M o, that contributes 4 [N] atoms. Each of the [N] atoms is directly

bonded to the [Mo], and to CH ligands. The H2/Ar plasma is able to break most N-Mo

bonds with 20s plasma, explaining the relatively low rate of [N] in the ﬁlm. The high content

of [C] in the ﬁlm on the other hand, suggests that the removed ligands are redeposited during

the plasma step, ultimately producing a M oCx ﬁlm. RBS measurements reveal a ﬁlm mass

density of 8.9 g/cm3, and [Mo] GPC of 1.33

nm2×cycle. The XRD
pattern show diﬀraction peaks corresponding to the (111) and (220) lattice planes of the

nm2×cycle and [C] of 0.83

atom

atom

delta-cubic M oCx. The (111) peak width appears broad and distorted, along with several

sharper smaller peaks between 28-33◦ 2θ. With 80 seconds plasma at 250◦C the C/Mo ratio

reduced from 0.63 to 0.56 and the nitrogen and hydrogen content from 5% to below detection

limits (±1% and ±5% respectively), as table II shows. The removal of [N] content supports

the role of the H2/Ar plasma in removal of N-Mo bonds, and redeposition of [C] from the

ligands, allbeit [C] removal eﬀects are revealed with the prolonged plasma exposure. As no

[O] was present in the bulk, XPS shows no signiﬁcant change in O1s peak (see ﬁgure 3) with

6

prolonged plasma, as oppose to ﬁlm deposited at 150◦C. Moreover, the ﬁlm’s mass density

has increased with the longer plasma exposure from 8.9 to 9.2 g/cm3. Film deposition at

250◦C and 80 seconds plasma exhibits a single diﬀraction peak of the (111) lattice plane,

while other diﬀraction peaks are completely suppressed (see ﬁgure 4). The broad peak

width indicates small order crystalline domains, embedded in mostly amorphous domains.
GPC for both conditions at 250◦C is at 0.25˚A, similar to deposition at 150◦C within error

margins. The growth of atoms per nm2cycle show a relatively unchanged growth in Mo

atoms (1.33 and 1.35 for 20s and 80s respectively), while the growth of C was reduced from

atom

atom

0.83

nm2×cycle to 0.76

nm2×cycle which correlates to the slight increase in density. The removal
of [C] content indicates more eﬃcient removal of ligands during deposition with prolonged

plasma time. Film deposition at 300◦C with 20 seconds plasma shows a signiﬁcant increase
in GPC from 0.25˚A for lower temperatures to 0.37˚A. RBS proﬁling reveal an increase in

growth per cycle a slight increase in Mo (1.35

impurities content reﬂected on the mass density, which sharply declined from 8.9 g/cm3 to

7.0 g/cm3 with the increase in temperature. Prolonging the plasma exposure time to 80

seconds results in decreased C/Mo from 0.92 to 0.78, a sharper decrease than that observed

at 250◦C. Correspondently, [Mo] atoms deposition rate increases from 1.45 to 1.63

and [C] decreases from 1.34 to 1.28

higher at 300◦C than for the same plasma time at 250◦C (∆[M o]250 = 0.02 at./nm2cycle and
∆[M o]300 = 0.2 at./nm2cycle). Additionally, [N] and [H] content decreased below detection
level for 80 seconds plasma. The lower C/Mo ratio and removal of additional impurities

atom

reﬂected in a higher mass density of 8.0 g/cm3. The ﬁlm deposited with 80 seconds plasma

show the dominant diﬀraction peak at 36.6◦ 2θ of the (111) plane. Comparison of ﬁlm

deposited with 80 seconds plasma exposure at diﬀerent temperatures, shows C/Mo ratio of

0.7 at 150◦C which is reduced to 0.56 at 250◦C and then increased to 0.78 at 300◦C. By

prolonging the plasma exposure time, the total ion energy dose to the deposition substrate is

increased linearly with time (eVion/s×P lasmaseconds). The increased energy dose resulted in

higher mass density and correspondently lower C/Mo ratio and mitigation of ﬁlm impurities

below detection levels. This reﬂected on the lowered ﬁlm resistivity, with two fold decrease

from 272 µΩ − cm to 143 µΩ − cm at 300◦C for 20s and 80s plasma respectively. However,

the eﬀect on ﬁlm crystallinity is not signiﬁcant.

Generally, the ﬁlms deposited at 300◦C show higher peak intensities and narrower peak

widths than ﬁlms at 250◦C which are mostly amorphous. Hence, more crystalline material

is present with larger crystal grains at higher temperature, whose eﬀect on crystallinity is

more signiﬁcant than plasma exposure time.

B. Biased Substrate eﬀects on ALD Films

The total energy dose to the deposition substrate can be alternatively altered by increas-

ing the ion energy. By applying radio-frequency (RF) bias voltage to the substrate we can

control the energy of ions impinging on the surface. An RF bias with time average voltage

(Vbias) between -100V to -200V was applied to study the eﬀects on the ﬁlm properties.

For these experiments we use 20 seconds of total plasma time, for a comparison with the

saturated non biased plasma time. The plasma during biased ALD is comprised of 10s non

biased followed by 10s biased plasma.

The mean energy of

the ion energy is calculated from the following equation:

Eion = e · Vsheath = e · (Vplasma − Vsurf ace)

Where Vplasma is the ion energy for 0V bias, measured to be 25eV for 100W plasma power

at 7mTorr pressure, and Vsurf ace is the time averaged bias voltage. Thus for an applied time

averaged Vbias ( < Vbias >) of -100V, the total mean ion energy is 125 eV. All bias experi-

ments performed were done at 300◦C, as the largest ﬂuctuation in ﬁlm density and content

occurs at this temperature. Figure 5 shows the eﬀect of applied bias on the GPC. When
−100Vbias was applied the GPC declined sharply from 0.37˚A at 300◦C with < 0Vbias > to
0.22˚A. RBS measurements reveal the cause for this signiﬁcant decline in a lowered [Mo] and

with over 60% decline from 1.34 to 0.81

[C] GPC upon applying bias voltage. [Mo] GPC declined from 1.45 to 1.02

nm2×cycle and [C]
nm2×cycle. The corresponding C/Mo ratio reduced
from 0.92 for the non biased case to 0.79 with −100Vbias. An eﬀect of M oCx densiﬁcation
is noted, with mass density measured at 8.2 g/cm3 for −100Vbias compared to a 7.0 g/cm3

atom

atom

for < 0Vbias >.

Physical alterations are also ﬁrst seen with the application of surface bias voltage, giving

the typical cubic δ − M oC0.75 structure with diﬀraction peaks at 35.75◦ and 41.42◦ 2θ (see

8

Preprint

Preprint

Preprint

ﬁgure 7). The dominant peak is the (111) plane, as the (200) plane peak almost completely

suppressed. The peak intensity increased by 2 orders of magnitude upon applying −100Vbias,
and peak FWHM decreased by half (0Vbias = 1.03 ◦2θ and −100Vbias = 0.49 ◦2θ). Crystallite

size has been calculated by ﬁtting the (111) and analysing the peak broadening using Scherrer

equation:

τ = K · λ/(β · cos θ)

The XRD data points to a highly crystalline material with crystallite size doubling in

comparison for non biased deposition. Crystallite size for 20s pl without bias is calculated to

be 9.0 nm while extending the plasma time yields a crystallite size of 7.6 nm, however this

slight decrease could be attributed to increased strain in the denser ﬁlm with 80s pl. When

−100Vbias bias is applied, crystallite doubles in size to 19.4 nm. As can be seen in ﬁgure 8,

the plan view high angle annular dark-ﬁeld (HAADF) TEM images support these ﬁndings.

The size of the visible structured material is signiﬁcantly increased and voids previously seen

for non biased deposition not detectable with −100Vbias.

C. Graphitisation during PEALD

With increased Vbias, further physical alterations and formation of graphitic nano layers

are revealed in the M oCx ﬁlm. With < −135Vbias > applied, the (111) lattice peak of the

cubic δ − M oC0.75 is diminished, and new diﬀraction peak appears corresponding to crys-

talline graphite. The emerging peak at 44.5 2θ◦ match the (101) graphite lattice plane and

is the dominating peak intensity, indicating strong graphitization with higher ion energies

(Eion = 155eV ). The observed emerging phase is consistent with increasing ion energy fur-

ther (−187Vbias, Eion = 212eV ), however the (101) peak intensity is somewhat diminished

in comparison to the previous bias step at −130Vbias. The GPC drops continuesly with in-
creasing Vbias, from 0.22˚A for -100V to 0.15˚A and 0.14˚A for -135V and -187V respectively.

While C/Mo ratio dropped with the application of −100Vbias from 0.92 for non biased ALD

to 0.79, this ratio has stagnated for higher applied Vbias, and the C/Mo ratio remained at

∼0.80.

D. Plasma Time and Bias Eﬀects on Film Resistivity

The eﬀect of plasma time on M oCx ﬁlm resistivity has been studied using four-point

probe (4PP) measurements. Film of comparable thickness of 30 nm have been deposited at

300◦C with plasma time ranging from 20 seconds (begin of saturation) up to 80 seconds.

Diﬀerence in ﬁlm thickness is within SE error margin. As shown in ﬁgure 10, a signiﬁcant

decrease in resistivity was measured with increase of plasma time. For 20 seconds plasma

resistivity was 272 µΩ − cm and a decrease to 242 µΩ − cm is seen with double the plasma

time (40 seconds). Further increase of plasma time to 60 seconds decreased resistivity to

181 µΩ − cm, and at the ﬁnal plasma time of 80 seconds 143 µΩ − cm was measured. By

increasing plasma time from 20 s to 40 s, XPS measurements revealed a reduction of C/Mo

ratio from 0.96 to 0.85. With a total 80 s plasma time, the C/Mo ratio decreased further

to 0.79. As was demonstrated above, the reduction in C/Mo ratio increased mass density

of the M oCx ﬁlm, and the higher ratio of [Mo] to [C] improves its electrical conductivity.

RF bias of the substrate table of average −100Vbias has been applied for the duration of

10 seconds, after 10 seconds of non-biased plasma exposure. Film resistivity was measured

for ﬁlms of comparable thickness of 30 nm. We correlate the change in resistivity to GPC

and density rates to gain further indications of chemical and physical eﬀects to the ﬁlm.

Figure 5 depicts GPC for biased ALD, and ﬁgure 12 the resistivity for the corresponding

bias voltages. With −100Vbias, ﬁlm resistivity was decreased to 144 and GPC ratio was

decreased from 0.36 (for 0Vbias)) to 0.22.

and 146 µΩ − cm respectively. The GPC ratio was decreased from 0.22 ˚A for -100V to
0.16˚A for -135V < Vbias >. As shown above, the C/Mo reduced upon application of bias

voltage from 0.92 to ∼ 0.8, which reﬂected in higher mass density. The produced denser and

more metallic ﬁlm translated to better electrical conductivity. Increasing the bias voltage

to -187V gives a slight rise in resistivity to 156 µΩ − cm and further decrease in GPC to
0.15˚A. At -210V < Vbias > a signiﬁcant increase to 200 µΩ − cm is shown with 0.14˚A GPC.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We presented here the ability to tailor M oCx ﬁlm by controlling the ion energy and

the total energy dose during PEALD. Additionally, we discover graphitic layer formation

during the PEALD cycle with mean ion energies between 150eV to 220eV. sp2 hybridised

carbon bonds appear to form during the high energy dose to the ﬁlm surface with average

bias voltage is increased to -135Vbias. Furthermore, the eﬀects of plasma time exposure,

and the ion energy in the plasma during PEALD modiﬁcation of the M oCx ﬁlm electrical,

chemical and physical properties were investigated. Both prolonged plasma and biasing are

successful in mitigating [N] impurities in the ﬁlm, and reducing C/Mo ratio. Consequently, a

signiﬁcantly lowered ﬁlm resistivity was attained of 143 µΩ − cm. Increasing the total energy

dose, which is a product of the mean Ei and the total plasma exposure time. With grounded

substrate table (< 0Vbias >) we can increase the total energy dose by prolonging the plasma

time, with mean ion energy ﬁxed at 25eV. By increasing the total plasma time from 20s to

80s, we increased ﬁlm density from 7 to 8, while retaining the ﬁlm physical properties. With

a ﬁxed plasma exposure time of 20 seconds, we increased the mean ion energy by substrate

biasing, thus increasing the total energy dose as well. We demonstrated an increase in mass

density with increased total energy dose, while no signiﬁcant change to crystallinity for the

same Ei. With substrate bias we elevated the impinging ion energies, and demonstrated

physical eﬀects to the ﬁlm. With mean ion energy of 125eV, a highly crystalline and dense

ﬁlm was fabricated corresponding the cubic δ − M oC0.79. We can achieve the same high

density, low resistivity ﬁlm in 20s plasma exposure time by biasing, as with long plasma

exposure time of 80s without biasing. However, by increasing the mean ion energy, we see

physical alterations similar to annealing eﬀects on ﬁlm, substituting the thermal energy

with plasma ion energy. With mean ion energy of ∼ 200eV we see the most crystalline

graphitic layer formation, indicating an optimal energy region for graphene formation. The

diminishing graphite crystallinity beyond mean ion energy of 200 eV indicates deterioration

of the graphite top layer by high energy ArH + ions. The increase in resistivity with further

decrease in GPC for < Vbias > beyond -135V suggest microstructural changes to the ﬁlm,

more so for the higher -210V. These changes could be in form of voids due to increased

ion energy bombardment. The bi-modal distribution of ion energy shows that part of the

incident ion have energies higher than -210 eV. The diminished intensity and increased

resistivity suggest that these high energy ions at the higher end of the spectrum, could

have a sputtering eﬀect on the graphitic top layer when impinging on the surface. Further

work needs to be done in optimising the graphene layer by exploring ideal RF bias plasma

exposure time, and mean ion energy, as the two determine the total energy dose to the ﬁlm

surface and quality of graphitisation. We postulate, that the high energy ions are able to

break Mo-C bonds and achieve a dominantly graphitic ﬁlm in the [C] rich atmosphere. A

trade-oﬀ between ion energy and the plasma exposure time needs to be explored, to ﬁne

tune the graphitisation.

The applied RF bias voltage eﬀect on ﬁlm crystallinity and composition is shown to

be critical. By controlling the mean ion energy of the impinging ions on the surface of the

deposited ﬁlm, we gain a powerful mean of inﬂuence on crystallinity and density alike. These

coupled physical and chemical eﬀects are derived from the composition of the coreactant

H2/Ar gas in the plasma.

[H] interaction with the surface is mainly chemical in nature,

while the heavier Ar atoms contribute to the physical eﬀects with their kinetic energy. The

produced ArH + ions in the plasma combine both these features, hence the coupled chemical

and physical eﬀects. By varying the ion energy, we alter predominantly the kinetic impact

eﬀect on ﬁlm, therefore the sharp changes to the M oCx crystallinity.

In conclusion, we demonstrated the control of mass density independent from ﬁlm crys-

tallinity, and a method to control both features by PEALD, without post deposition thermal

annealing treatments, or high temperature deposition. Furthermore, this work paves the way

to fabrication of graphene layers with PEALD, crucial for the production of stacked layers,

with atomic precision and high ﬁlm purity. Moreover, the fabrication can be performed in

temperatures as low as 300◦C. This eﬀect could play a signiﬁcant role in various applications

that require low thermal budget. The ability of control in PEALD of M oCx opens a window

for the integration of tailor-made thin M oCx, as well as low temperature graphene ﬁlms in

a wide range of applications previously unavailable.
