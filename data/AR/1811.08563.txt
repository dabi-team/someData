ABSTRACT

Employing Solar Dynamic Observatory/Atmosphertic Imaging Assembly (AIA)
multi-wavelength images, we study an eruption of two crossing ﬁlaments, and ﬁrstly
report the current sheets (CSs) connecting the lower ﬂare ribbons and the upper erupt-
ing ﬁlaments. On July 8, 2014, two crossing ﬁlaments are observed in the NOAA ac-
tive region (AR) 12113. The lower-lying ﬁlament rises ﬁrst, and then meets the higher-
lying one. Thereafter, both of them erupt together. The ﬁlament eruption draws the
overlying magnetic ﬁeld lines upward, leading to the approach of two legs, with oppo-
site magnetic polarities, of the overlying ﬁeld lines. Two sets of bright CSs form at the
interface of these two legs, and magnetic reconnection takes place in the CSs produc-
ing the underneath ﬂare ribbons and post-ﬂare loops. Several bright plasmoids appear
in the CSs, and propagate along the CSs bi-directionally. The CSs and plasmoids are
observed in AIA multi-wavelength channels, indicating that both of them have been
heated during the reconnection process, with hot and warm components. Employing
the differential emission measure (EM) analysis, we ﬁnd that both the temperature and
EM of the CSs decrease from the ﬂare arcades outward to the erupting ﬁlaments, and
those of the plasmoids are signiﬁcantly larger than the regions where no plasmoid is
detected.

Introduction

Solar ﬁlaments (prominences) are chromospheric and coronal structures that contain relatively
cool and dense plasma suspended along the magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs) (Gaizauskas et al.
1997; Jiang & Wang 2001). They are observed as dark “ﬁlaments” on the solar disk, and bright
“prominences” above the solar limb in multi-wavelength images (Mackay et al. 2010). Accord-
ing to their locations, the ﬁlaments are usually divided into three types: (1) active region (AR)
ﬁlaments, (2) intermediate ﬁlaments, and (3) quiescent ﬁlaments (Yan et al. 2015). Among them,
the AR ﬁlaments are usually active and sometimes erupt (Chen et al. 2009; Shen et al. 2012;
Schmieder et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). The successful ﬁlament eruptions are closely associ-
ated with the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and ﬂares (Zhou et al. 2003; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005;
Chen 2011; Song et al. 2018).

The erupting ﬁlament stretches its overlying magnetic ﬁeld lines upward, makes their legs
with opposite polarities converge (Shibata 1999; Lin & Forbes 2000). The current sheets (CSs)
then form at the interface, connecting the bottom of the upper erupting ﬁlament and the tip of the
lower ﬂare arcades (Li et al. 2016a; Yan et al. 2018). Magnetic reconnection takes place in the
CSs, converting magnetic energy to other forms, e.g. thermal, kinetic, and particle (Reeves & Golub
2011; Li et al. 2016b). Following the CME leading edge, the white light (WL) ray-like structures
are detected in coronagraph images, and presented as observational evidence of CSs (Webb et al.
2003). Employing Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) observations, CSs are identiﬁed
as narrow hot features of plasma between the ﬂare arcades and CME cores (Ciaravella et al. 2002;
Ko et al. 2003; Bemporad et al. 2006; Ciaravella & Raymond 2008; Schettino et al. 2010). Using
Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) observations, CSs are proposed
as hot gas with large line widths above the post-ﬂare loops (Innes et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2007).
Utilizing multi-viewpoint observations, Patsourakos & Vourlidas (2011) analyze a post-CME ray,
and suggest that it is indeed related to a post-CME CS. Employing the Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) multi-
wavelength images, the CSs are detected as very high temperature plasma (Reeves & Golub 2011;
Savage et al. 2012; Li et al. 2016a). Recently, various properties of CSs, including the tempera-
ture, width, and density, have also been investigated (Ciaravella & Raymond 2008; Su et al. 2013;
Ciaravella et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016a).

Crossing ﬁlaments, reﬂecting the complex magnetic ﬁeld topology nearby, are rarely observed
and investigated. How are the magnetic ﬁelds distributed near the crossing ﬁlaments? How do the
surrounding magnetic ﬁelds evolve during eruptions of the crossing ﬁlaments? These are still
open questions. On July 8, 2014, an eruption of two crossing ﬁlaments in NOAA AR 12113 was
recorded by SDO/AIA. In this Letter, we study the evolution of the ﬁlament eruption, and report
the CSs connecting the lower ﬂare ribbons and the upper erupting ﬁlaments for the ﬁrst time. The

– 3 –

observations and results are separately presented in Sections 2 and 3. The summary and discussion
are presented in Section 4.

2. Data and observations

SDO/AIA is a set of normal incidence imaging telescopes, acquiring solar atmospheric images
in ten wavelength channels. Different AIA channels show plasma at different temperatures. In
this study, we employ AIA multi-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) and extreme UV (EUV) images,
with spatial sampling and time cadence of 0.6′′ pixel−1 and 12 s, respectively, to investigate the
evolution of the ﬁlament eruption and its following CSs. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI,
Schou et al. 2012) line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms, with spatial sampling and time cadence
of 0.5′′ pixel−1 and 45 s, respectively, are also used to analyze the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of
the ﬁlament eruption source region. In addition, we employ the WL coronagraph images from
LASCO/C2 to study the evolution of the associated CME.

3. Results

Two S-shaped ﬁlaments, F1 and F2, with lengths of ∼37 Mm and ∼62 Mm, respectively, are
observed in AIA multi-wavelength channels, denoted by green and blue dotted lines in Figure 1(a).
By investigating the structures and evolutions of these two ﬁlaments and also the associated photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁelds in the source region, we note that they are located upon the complex PILs
of the NOAA AR 12113, see Figure 1(b). Successive ﬂows along the ﬁlament F2 are identiﬁed,
and the ﬁlament F2 becomes bright, underneath the ﬁlament F1 (see the online animated version
of Figure 1(d)). Two ﬁlaments F1 and F2 thus cross each other at almost the middle positions,
see Figure 1(c), and separately connect the southern positive and northern negative polarity mag-
netic ﬁelds of the AR, see Figure 1(b). Since ∼15:50 UT, the lower-lying ﬁlament F2 slowly rose,
see Figure 1(c). It met the higher-lying crossing ﬁlament F1 at ∼16:05 UT. Both of them then
erupt together outward to the northeast (see the online animated version of Figure 1(d)). Along
the erupting direction, denoted by a blue line AB in Figure 1(d), we make a time-slice of AIA 304
˚A images, and show it in Figure 1(e). It indicates that the ﬁlaments ﬁrst rise slowly with a mean
speed of ∼20 km s−1, and then erupt quickly with a larger mean speed of ∼660 km s−1 and a mean
acceleration of ∼1 km s−2. Since 16:36 UT, an associated CME, with a mean speed of ∼400 km
s−1, was detected in the FOV of LASCO/C2, see Figures 1((f)-(g)).

An associated M6.5 class ﬂare took place since ∼16:08 UT (see the online animated version
of Figure 2). The initial brightenings of two ﬂare ribbons (FRs) are separately enclosed by the

– 4 –

blue and red ellipses in Figure 2(a). Thereafter, they elongate bi-directionally along the PILs of
the AR, see the green and pink contours in Figure 2(b). Along the elongating directions, denoted
by a black line CD in Figure 2(b), we make a time-slice of AIA 1600 ˚A images, and display it in
Figure 2(c). Evident elongations of the FRs are detected at mean speeds of ∼40 km s−1 northward
and 30 km s−1 southward, respectively. Furthermore, complex ﬂare ribbons are detected under the
crossing parts of two ﬁlaments, see Figure 2(b). The post-ﬂare loops appeared since ∼16:15 UT,
marked by two black dotted lines in Figure 2(d). We overlay the initial brightenings of FRs on
Figure 2(d) as blue and red ellipses, and notice that the initial post-ﬂare loops connect the initial
FRs. Consistent with the FRs, the brightening of post-ﬂare loops also propagates along the PILs
of the AR, see the green and pink contours in Figure 2(e), bi-directionally. Along the propagating
direction, denoted by a black line EF in Figure 2(e), we make a time-slice of AIA 171 ˚A images,
and show it in Figure 2(f). The post-ﬂare loops propagate clearly at a mean speed of ∼20 km s−1.
Below the crossing parts of two ﬁlaments, similar to the ﬂare ribbons, complex post-ﬂare loops are
identiﬁed, see Figure 2(e). These observations indicate that the magnetic reconnection in the wake
of the erupting ﬁlaments occurs in the middle position, and then takes place successively along the
AR PILs bi-directionally.

Above the FRs, two sets of bright structures, connecting the lower FRs and the upper erupting
ﬁlaments, were observed in AIA multi-wavelength channels from 16:12 UT to 16:22 UT (see
the online animated version of Figure 3). We overlay the initial FRs displayed in Figure 2(a) on
Figures 3(a) and (d) as blue and red ellipses. The eastern (western) bright structures root in the
eastern (western) initial FRs, rather than the footpoints of the erupting ﬁlaments. In the bright
structures, several elliptical brighter, i.e., 20% more intensities than those of the adjacent parts
along the bright structure, plasmoids appear and propagate upward and downward along the bright
structures. Similar bright ray-like structures are identiﬁed in LASCO/C2 coronagraph images in
the wake of the erupting ﬁlaments, see Figures 1((f)-(g)). All these observations support that these
bright structures represent the post-eruption CSs connecting the lower FRs and the upper erupting
ﬁlaments.

Figure 3(a) shows one CS (CS1) in AIA 94 ˚A channel at 16:13:37 UT with a width, the
full width at half maximum of the intensity proﬁle of the AIA 94 ˚A channel centering around,
perpendicular to the CS, of ∼2.8 Mm. Here, the intensity proﬁle of the AIA 94 ˚A channel is revised
by subtracting the nearby background. By tracing the plasmoids, with similar shape and without
sudden change, in the animation frame by frame, we follow the evolution of plasmoids. The
triangles in Figures 3((a)-(c)) mark a plasmoid, P1, in the CS at different times. They indicate that
the plasmoid moves upward along the CS. By ﬁtting the temporal evolution of the displacements of
plasmoid centroid linearly, we measure the mean moving speed of the plasmoid, and obtain a mean
value of 360 km s−1, see the green arrow in Figure 3(b). From 16:14:25 UT, another plasmoid, P2,
marked by a square in Figure 3(c), appeared in the CS1, and moved downward to the solar surface

– 5 –

with a mean speed of ∼320 km s−1, see the green arrow in Figure 3(d). The CS1 disappeared after
∼16:17 UT. The red dashed line in Figure 3(d) outlines another set of CS (CS2) at 16:14:49 UT,
with the width of ∼3.5 Mm. Several ﬁne structures, i.e., threads, of CS2 are detected clearly in AIA
multi-wavelength channels, e.g. 335, 193, 171, 131, and 304 ˚A, with a mean width of ∼1.5 Mm
(see the online animated version of Figure 1(d)). Moreover, the CS width in coronagraph images is
also calculated with a mean value of ∼40 Mm. The circles in Figures 3((d)-(f)) mark a plasmoid,
P3, in the CS2. It moves upward with a speed of ∼350 km s−1. In this event, most of the plasmoids
move outward along the CSs. Due to the ﬁlament eruption, the CS2 moves laterally, see the colored
dashed lines in Figure 3(f). The CSs become invisible in AIA wavelength channels after ∼16:22
UT, lasting for ∼10 min.

The temperature and EM maps are obtained using the DEM analysis method (Cheng et al.
2012), where six AIA channels, including 131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 171 ˚A, are em-
ployed. Figures 4(a) and (b) separately show the temperature and the EM maps at 16:44 UT, when
the CS2 were well-developed and the plasmoids were clearly detected. Along the CS2, the spatial
distributions of the mean temperature and EM within the white rectangles in Figures 4(a) and (b)
are investigated, and showed in Figure 4(c) as black and blue curves, respectively. The temper-
ature drops from ∼8 MK to ∼5 MK in ∼30′′, while the EM decreases from 2.8×1028 cm−5 to
1.5×1028 cm−5, along the CS2 outward. Assuming that the LOS depth, d, of the CS equals its
width (3.5 Mm), and is constant along the length, we estimate the density, n, along the CS from
the EM by using n=(EM d−1)0.5, and obtain a range of (6.5-8.9)×109 cm−3. Several peaks of the
temperature and EM curves are detected, corresponding to the plasmoids formed in the CS2. They
show larger values than other CS part where no plasmoid is detected. A plasmoid, marked by
the blue rectangles in Figures 4((a)-(b)), is investigated in detail. Its DEM curve is displayed in
Figure 4(d). Here, 100 Monte Carlo realizations of the data are computed. The upper and lower
ends of the colored rectangles in Figure 4(d) can be regarded as estimates of the uncertainties in the
best-ﬁt solution, the black solid curve in Figure 4(d), indicating how well the DEM is determined
at a given temperature bin. The fairly broad curve, with mean temperature and EM of 7.8 MK and
9.8×1028 cm−5, respectively, indicates that the plasmoid shows a multi-temperature structure, con-
sistent with the observation that the CSs and plasmoids are both observed in AIA multi-wavelength
channels.

4. Summary and discussion

On July 8, 2014, two crossing ﬁlaments, located upon the complex PILs of NOAA AR 12113,
are observed. The lower-lying ﬁlament rises slowly and meets the higher-lying one. Both of them
then erupt together, resulting in a CME and an M 6.5 ﬂare. The FRs and post-ﬂare loops ﬁrst

– 6 –

appear in the middle, and then successively propagate bi-directionally along the AR PILs. Two
sets of CSs, connecting the lower initial FRs and the upper erupting ﬁlaments, are identiﬁed in
AIA multi-wavelength images and LASCO/C2 WL coronagraph images. Bright plasmoids appear
in the CSs, and move along the CSs upward and downward. They also appear in AIA multi-
wavelength channels, showing multi-temperature plasma structures. The temperature and EM of
CSs both decrease along the CS outward away from the solar surface.

Based on the AIA multi-wavelength observations, schematic diagrams are provided in Fig-
ure 5 to explain the evolution of the ﬁlament eruption and its underlying CSs. Because of the
eruption of two crossing ﬁlaments, see Figure 5(a), the overlying magnetic ﬁled lines are drawn
upward. The legs of the overlying ﬁeld lines, with opposite magnetic polarities, converge and in-
teract. The CSs then form at the interacting region, see Figure 5(b). Magnetic reconnection, taking
place in the CSs, produces the underlying FRs and post-ﬂare loops, see Figure 5(c).

Crossing ﬁlaments are rarely studied, which represent the complex topology of the photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld (Filippov & Srivastava 2011), see Figure 1(b). No magnetic reconnection
signature, e.g. brightening, is detected between these two crossing ﬁlaments when they meet. It in-
dicates that these two ﬁlaments have same polarity axial ﬁeld lines, consistent with the connections
between the ﬁlaments and the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds, see Figure 1(b).

The evolution of the FRs and post-ﬂare loops hints essential information of three dimensional
(3D) magnetic reconnection during the ﬁlament eruption. Both the FRs and post-ﬂare loops ap-
pear in the middle, and then propagate along the PILs of the AR. This shows that the magnetic
reconnection between two legs of the overlying ﬁeld lines of the ﬁlament eruption takes place ﬁrst
in the middle, and then successively happens along the AR PILs bi-directionally. This evolution of
the magnetic reconnection is caused by the nature of the ﬁlament eruption, that starts to rise from
the middle part (Li & Zhang 2009). Furthermore, both the complex ﬂare ribbons and the complex
post-ﬂare loops are detected under the crossing parts of two ﬁlaments, representing the complex
magnetic ﬁelds distributed near the crossing ﬁlaments.

The post-eruption CSs are observed on the solar disk, while those post-eruption CSs pre-
viously studied are mostly detected above the solar limb (Ciaravella et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2010,
2013; Li et al. 2016a). For the observations, e.g. WL coronagraph images, away from the solar
surface, the ﬁlament erupts perpendicular to the LOS in the limb events, and goes out of the FOV
of the instruments, e.g. LASCO/C2, quickly. Therefore, only ray-like structures are identiﬁed
(Ciaravella et al. 2002; Webb et al. 2003; Ciaravella & Raymond 2008). However, the ﬁlaments in
this event erupt radially, and stay a longer time in the FOV of LASCO/C2. Thus the post-eruption
CSs connecting the upper erupting ﬁlaments, rather than only ray-like structures, are clearly iden-
tiﬁed, see Figures 1((f)-(g)). For the observations, e.g. EUV images, near the solar surfance, the
CSs well above the cusp-shaped ﬂare loops have been reported for the limb events (Liu et al. 2010,

– 7 –

2013; Li et al. 2016a). Different from previous studies, the CSs in this study root in the lower
FRs, see Figures 3(a) and (d). This is not reported before. The CSs may include the lower part of
the legs of the overlying ﬁeld lines below the reconnecting region, which constitute the post-ﬂare
loops after the magnetic reconnection, see Figure 5(b).

The observable structures of CSs are detected depending on the nature, e.g. density and tem-
perature, of plasma in and surrounding the CSs (Reeves et al. 2010). This may be why only two
sets of CSs are observed in this event, see Figure 5(b). The width of CSs ranges from 1.5-3.5 Mm
in EUV images, consistent with Li et al. (2016a), but smaller than those of Savage et al. (2010),
Liu et al. (2010), and Ling et al. (2014). It is 40 Mm in WL coronagraph images, identical to those
of Ciaravella et al. (2002), Ciaravella & Raymond (2008), and Li et al. (2016a). For different in-
struments, the CS widths are different may be caused by three reasons: (1) the nature of emissions
and wavelength bandpasses; (2) the spatial samplings of different instruments; and (3) the physical
mechanisms, e.g. turbance (Bemporad 2008; Li et al. 2016a).

The appearance of plasmoids in the CSs indicates the presence of plasmoid instabilities during
the reconnection process (Bhattacharjee et al. 2009; Takasao et al. 2012; Li et al. 2016b). Both
the plasmoids and CSs are observed in AIA multi-wavelength channels, showing that they are
heated with multi-temperature plasma. This is consistent with Li et al. (2016b), but different from
Hanneman & Reeves (2014) and Li et al. (2016a) as they show only hot CSs. Furthermore, the
temperature, EM, and density of the CSs decrease outward from the solar surface along the CSs
(Sun et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016a).
