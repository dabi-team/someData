ABSTRACT

Context. Active regions (ARs) play an important role in the magnetic dynamics of the Sun. Solar surface ﬂux transport models
(SFTMs) are used to describe the evolution of the radial magnetic ﬁeld at the solar surface. The models are kinematic in the sense
that the radial component of the magnetic ﬁeld behaves like passively advected corks. There is however uncertainty about using these
models in the early stage of active region evolution, where dynamic eﬀects might be important.
Aims. We aim to test the applicability of SFTMs in the ﬁrst days after the emergence of active regions by comparing them with
observations. The models we employ range from passive evolution to models where the inﬂows around active regions are included.
Methods. We simulate the evolution of the surface magnetic ﬁeld of 17 emerging active regions using a local surface ﬂux transport
simulation. The regions are selected such that they do not form fully-ﬂedged sunspots that exhibit moat ﬂows. The simulation includes
diﬀusion and advection by a velocity ﬁeld, for which we test diﬀerent models. For the ﬂow ﬁelds, we use observed ﬂows from local
correlation tracking of solar granulation, as well as parametrizations of the inﬂows around active regions based on the gradient of
the magnetic ﬁeld. To evaluate our simulations, we measure the cross correlation between the observed and the simulated magnetic
ﬁeld, as well as the total unsigned ﬂux of the ARs, over time. We also test the validity of our simulations by varying the starting time
relative to the emergence of ﬂux.
Results. We ﬁnd that the simulations using observed surface ﬂows can reproduce the evolution of the observed magnetic ﬂux. The
eﬀect of buﬀeting of the ﬁeld by supergranulation can be described as a diﬀusion process. The SFTM is applicable after 90 % of the
peak total unsigned ﬂux of the active region has emerged. Diﬀusivities in the range between D = 250 to 720 km2 s−1 are consistent
with the evolution of the AR ﬂux in the ﬁrst ﬁve days after this time. We ﬁnd that the converging ﬂows around emerging active regions
are not important for the evolution of the total ﬂux of the AR in these ﬁrst ﬁve days; their eﬀect of increasing ﬂux cancellation is
balanced by the decrease of ﬂux transport away from the AR.

1. Introduction

Active regions (hereafter ARs) are the surface signature of mag-
netic ﬂux rising from the interior of the Sun. They are the site
of eruptive events such as jets and ﬂares, and play an important
role in the solar dynamo.

During the emergence of active regions, their magnetic po-
larities move apart, and develop a tilt angle, with the leading po-
larity closer to the equator than the trailing polarity (e.g. Schun-
ker et al. 2020, for a review see van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green
2015). This is consistent with the footpoints of the ﬂux being
connected to the subsurface ﬁeld, and separating due to the ac-
tion of magnetic tension and drag force (Chen et al. 2017; Schun-
ker et al. 2019). Schunker et al. (2019) calculated separation
speeds of AR polarities and suggested that during emergence,
the magnetic tension and drag force play a stronger role in trans-
porting the magnetic ﬁeld than diﬀusion. They also found that
the scatter in polarity positions increases with time consistently
with buﬀeting by supergranulation.

Studying the surface magnetic ﬁeld of active regions helps
to understand their evolution, and the buildup of poloidal ﬁeld in
the solar cycle. In addition to the systematic motions from e.g.
magnetic tension, the processes on the solar surface that displace
magnetic ﬂux are the random motions of convective granula-

tion and supergranulation on smaller scales as well as systematic
ﬂows on larger scales, such as diﬀerential rotation, the merid-
ional ﬂow, and inﬂows around active regions. The random con-
vective motions can be treated as a diﬀusion process (Leighton
1964), which can be implemented in surface ﬂux transport mod-
els (SFTMs) as a random walk. Estimates of the diﬀusion rate
D from observations typically indicate D = 250 km2 s−1 (Ja-
farzadeh et al. 2014), but higher values up to D = 500 km2 s−1
have also been reported (Wang et al. 2002; Yeates 2020).

Inﬂows on various spatial and temporal scales around
evolved active regions have been measured by e.g. Gizon et al.
(2001); Haber et al. (2004); Komm et al. (2012); Löptien et al.
(2017); Braun (2019). They span approximately 10° from the ac-
tive region, and have velocities of about 50 m s−1. It is thought
that the inﬂows may be driven by increased cooling in ARs
(Spruit 2003). Cameron & Schüssler (2012) proposed these in-
ﬂows as a possible mechanism for a non-linearity that regu-
lates the solar cycle strengths in the solar dynamo. Recently,
Gottschling et al. (2021) measured the evolution of the ﬂows
around emerging active regions from before to up to seven days
after emergence, ﬁnding that the time between the AR emer-
gence and the time at which inﬂows set in after the emergence
increases with the total magnetic ﬁeld of the AR. These inﬂows

have velocities of about 50 m s−1 as well, but appear to be smaller
in extent than the inﬂows around evolved ARs. Gottschling et al.
(2021) found no strong dependence of the amplitude of these
inﬂows on the ﬁeld strength of the active regions. The nature
of these observed inﬂows in the ﬁrst days after emergence is
not clear, and their driving mechanism could be diﬀerent from
that of the inﬂows around evolved active regions. They could
be the result of a passive emergence, in which the rising ﬂux
is aﬀected by the supergranulation pattern (Birch et al. 2019).
Another scenario is that they are driven by the magnetic tension
that moves the polarities apart in the ﬁrst days after emergence,
see Cameron et al. (2010), Schunker et al. (2019). In a three-
dimensional MHD simulation of a rising ﬂux tube in a rotat-
ing convection zone, Abbett et al. (2001) also found converging
ﬂows.

Several studies have incorporated inﬂows around active re-
gions in surface ﬂux transport models (De Rosa & Schrijver
2006; Jiang et al. 2010; Cameron & Schüssler 2012; Yeates
2014; Martin-Belda & Cameron 2016, 2017). Martin-Belda &
Cameron (2016) found that the inﬂows enhance ﬂux cancella-
tion, and can in conjunction with diﬀerential rotation produce a
net tilt angle. This tilt is however too small compared with ob-
served tilt angles. Martin-Belda & Cameron (2017) investigated
the eﬀect on the large-scale ﬁeld and found that the inﬂows can
lead to a reduction of the axial dipole moment by 30 %. Inclu-
sion of the inﬂows into global SFTMs improve the match to the
global dipole for the solar cycles 13 to 21 (Cameron & Schüssler
2012), and can account for the excess strength of the polar ﬁeld
at activity minimum in simulations, by eﬀectively reducing the
tilt angle of active regions (Cameron et al. 2010; Yeates 2014).
However, recently Yeates (2020) argued that this excess strength
can be a result of the bipolar approximation of the active regions.
On the other hand, Yeates (2014) found that the incorporation of
the inﬂows (in form of a perturbation of the meridional ﬂow) de-
lays the dipole reversal times for solar cycle 23 with respect to
the observed cycle.

The above studies used simple mathematical descriptions as
parametrizations of the inﬂows. They were included either as
a perturbation of the meridional ﬂow at active latitudes (Jiang
et al. 2010; Cameron & Schüssler 2012; Yeates 2014), or as the
gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld (De Rosa & Schrijver 2006), with
a normalization such that the extent and the amplitude of the
inﬂows are similar to the observed values. The latter however
raised the problem that ﬂux of an isolated AR got ’trapped’ by
the inﬂow ﬁeld due to the inward-directed ﬂows from all sides,
such that ﬂux cannot escape the active region. The ﬂux is pushed
into small, long-lived clumps, which are not observed. Part of
this eﬀect might however be caused by the ﬂux-dependent diﬀu-
sion that was used (Martin-Belda & Cameron 2016).

In this work, we use a local surface ﬂux transport model to
simulate the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld of ARs, and com-
pare it to the observed evolution. For this, we consider a sample
of emerging active regions that take several days to cross the
visible disk after the bulk of ﬂux has emerged. The simulations
include transport by diﬀusion and by advection due to surface
ﬂows. We test diﬀerent models for both. For the advection, we
use observed ﬂow maps from correlation tracking of solar gran-
ules as well as ﬂow parametrizations from the literature, moti-
vated by the resemblance of the observed ﬂows in the ﬁrst days
after emergence with the inﬂows around active regions.

This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the
sample of active regions on which we carry out the ﬂux transport
simulation. In Sect. 3, we describe the SFTM simulation that
we use, as well as the diﬀerent models of the ﬂow ﬁeld and the

(Sect. 5).

2. Active region sample

We identify active regions that emerge into the quiet Sun and re-
main on the visible disk for multiple days after their emergence
using the Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic Emerging
Active Regions (SDO/HEAR) survey (Schunker et al. 2016).
The survey consists of 182 emerging active regions that are ob-
served between up to seven days before and after the time of
emergence t0, at which the region reaches 10 % of the maximum
total unsigned ﬂux within the ﬁrst 36 h after ﬁrst appearance in
the NOAA record.

From the 182 active regions in the HEAR survey, we selected
those regions that do not develop a fully-ﬂedged sunspot with a
clear penumbra over the disk passage. Fully-ﬂedged spots show
moat ﬂow signatures (Sheeley 1972). At the grid scale that we
use in our simulation, which is limited by the observed ﬂows
(see Sect. 3.1), the moat ﬂow spatially overlaps with the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the spots. In the simulation, this would lead to a
disruption of the spots into ring-like structures, which is incon-
sistent with observations. The sunspot identiﬁcation is done with
the sunspot quality number from Gottschling et al. (2021), where
a sunspot quality of 0 indicates a spot with a clear penumbra. Af-
ter excluding these regions, 92 ARs are left in the sample.

For a comparison of the observed and the simulated magnetic
ﬁeld, the ARs have to remain on the visible disk for several days
after the simulations are initialized. To select suitable ARs, we
created data cubes of the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld observed
by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO/HMI, Schou et al. 2012), projected to
Plate Carree projection and corrected for the viewing angle µ.
The cubes have a ﬁeld of view of 60° × 60° and a grid spacing
of 0.4° in both longitude and latitude, centered on the active re-
gion centres as deﬁned in the HEAR survey. The grid spacing
is the same as that of the observed ﬂow maps (Sect. 3.1). On
the temporal axis, the cubes span up to seven days before and
after the time of emergence, in non-overlapping twelve-hour av-

erages. We measured the total unsigned ﬂux of each active region
as the total unsigned ﬂux in a disk of 5° radius around the cen-
ter of the AR. From this, we determined the time t90% at which
90 % of the maximum total unsigned ﬂux of the active region has
emerged, in the period covered by the HEAR survey. This is in
analogy to the deﬁnition of the emergence time t0.

The observed ﬂows have data coverage out to only 60° from
disk center, which limits the last last time step tlast that can be
used in the simulation. We identify tlast as the last time step where
more than half of the ﬁeld of view of the observed ﬂow ﬁeld is
within a distance of 60° to the disk center.

For the sample selection, we require that the time between
t90% and tlast is at least 5.5 days. This leaves 17 ARs. Appendix A
lists all ARs in this sample. Because of the selection criteria (the
exclusion of ARs that form fully-ﬂedged sunspots, and the re-
quirement of several days of observations after most of the ﬂux
has emerged), the selected ARs are relatively weak and short-
lived, and are well into their decaying phase at the end of the
observations.

Fig. 1 shows a few examples of the evolution of the twelve-
hour averaged total unsigned ﬂux over time, relative to t90%. In
most cases, the peak ﬂux occurs at the time t90% + 0.5 days. The
average total unsigned ﬂux over the sample of ARs at that time
is 1.65 × 1021 Mx, with a standard deviation of 0.66 × 1021 Mx.

3. Cork simulation for local surface ﬂux transport

For the local ﬂux transport simulation, we adapt the cork sim-
ulation of Langfellner et al. (2018). The simulation treats the
magnetic ﬁeld from an initial input magnetogram as individual,
passive ﬂux elements (’corks’) in x, y coordinates correspond-
ing to the longitudinal and latitudinal axes of the projected input
magnetic ﬁeld map. At each simulation time step ∆t, each cork
moves a certain distance from its former position. There are two
contributions to this motion: A diﬀusive part, which is realized
as a random walk, and an advective part, which is realized as a
ﬂow ﬁeld that moves each cork according to the velocity vector
at its position.

Langfellner et al. (2018) considered only unsigned magnetic
ﬁeld, and included spawning of randomly distributed new ﬁeld
as well as random removal of existing ﬁeld. We do not include
the random spawning and removal, as we are studying the AR
polarities, for which the magnetic ﬁeld is dominated by the emer-
gence. We expand the simulation by considering positive and
negative ﬁeld and incorporating ﬂux cancellation between the
two. Corks of opposite polarity that move within 1 Mm of each
other are removed from the simulation. The distance threshold is
the same as that used by Martin-Belda & Cameron (2016).

We initialize the simulations with individual time steps from
the magnetogram cubes described in Sect. 2, recentered to the
center of the active region at time t90%. A magnetic ﬂux den-
sity of 1 Gauss in the observations corresponds to one cork in
the simulation. The output of the simulations are magnetic ﬁeld
maps for each simulation time step ∆t. The (signed) magnetic
ﬂux density at each grid element in these maps is the diﬀerence
between the number of positive and negative corks that have x, y
coordinates within that grid element.

We run the simulations with a simulation time step ∆t of
30 minutes. We average the simulation output to the same
twelve-hour averages as the observations, for direct compari-
son between simulations and observations. For each AR, we run
20 realizations of each simulation model and average over them,
to decrease the realization noise from the random-walk diﬀusion
models. The number of realizations is limited by computation

age at four days after t90%. The ﬂow maps are smoothed with a Gaussian

at +(−)15 Gauss.

(no ﬂows, u = 0; observed ﬂows, uobs; parameterized inﬂows around
active regions, u∇B; or modiﬁed parameterized inﬂows, u (cid:102)∇B), and a dif-
fusion model (no diﬀusion, D = 0; constant diﬀusivity, Dc; or ﬂux-
dependent diﬀusivity, Df). Fig. 3 shows snapshots from each simulation
for AR 11137.

time. The results do however not diﬀer from those with less (e.g.
ﬁve) realizations.

3.1. Flow models
We use four diﬀerent ﬂow models in our simulations: no ﬂow
ﬁeld (u = 0), ﬂows from observations (u = uobs), and two pa-
rameterized, gradient-based models (u = u∇B and u = u (cid:102)∇B). We
run each of these models with two diﬀerent random-walk diﬀu-
sion models. In an additional case, we add no diﬀusion. Thus,
we have nine diﬀerent simulation setups (see Table 1).

No ﬂows (u = 0): Here, we include no ﬂow ﬁeld in the sim-

ulation. Thus, only diﬀusion displaces the corks.

Observed ﬂows (u = uobs): In this model, we use the ﬂow
maps from Gottschling et al. (2021) for the ARs in the sample.
The ﬂows stem from local correlation tracking (LCT, Novem-
ber & Simon 1988) of solar continuum intensity images, and

are based on the data processing by Löptien et al. (2017), who
used the Fourier local correlation tracking code (Welsch et al.
2004; Fisher & Welsch 2008) on full-disk continuum intensity
images from SDO/HMI. Several changes in the data process-
ing were made by Gottschling et al. (2021) in order to correct
for additional systematic eﬀects in the data from Löptien et al.
(2017). Gottschling et al. (2021) describe these changes in detail.
The ﬂow maps are in Plate Carree projection with a grid spacing
of 0.4°, with the same centering and twelve-hour time steps as
the magnetograms (see Sect. 2). In the SFTM, these are Fourier-
interpolated to the 30 min simulation time step ∆t. Fig. 2 shows
the average magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂows over the sample of ARs, at
four days after t90%. Converging ﬂows towards the center of the
AR are visible, with velocities on the order of 50 m s−1. Inﬂows
are more pronounced along the latitudinal axis than along the
longitudinal axis.

(u = u∇B): We adopt

the
parametrization of the inﬂows around active regions by De Rosa
& Schrijver (2006), who used it on the simulation by Schrijver
(2001) to study the evolution of the ﬁeld on large timescales,
i.e. multiple rotations. Here, we apply it to the ﬁrst few days af-
ter emergence, motivated by the resemblance of the observed
ﬂows to the inﬂows around active regions (see Fig. 2). The
parametrization is
(cid:16)
U = α∇
(1)
where U is the ﬂow ﬁeld (ulon, ulat), ˜B is the magnetic ﬁeld,
smoothed with a Gaussian with a full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of 15°, and α and β are free parameters. Martin-Belda
& Cameron (2017) used Eq. 1 with β = 1 and normalized it
such that the peak inﬂow velocity around an active region of 10°
is 50 m s−1, with α = 1.8 × 108 m2 Gauss−1 s−1. We adopt these
choices for our model. The choice of β is further motivated by the
observed ﬂux density corresponding to the product of the ﬁeld
strength and the ﬁlling factor. If the inﬂows are driven by excess
cooling, as suggested by Spruit (2003), they are proportional to
the ﬁlling factor, and thus β = 1. Because we investigate active
regions shortly after their emergence, their extent is consider-
ably smaller than 10°. Therefore, the inﬂows in this model will
have too large extents and amplitudes well below 50 m s−1. In
previous studies, these parameterized inﬂows led to ﬂux clump-
ing. In Appendix B, we therefore compare the inﬂows from this
parametrization to the ﬂow ﬁeld that would balance the diﬀusion
of a ﬂux concentration. If the inﬂows were stronger than this ﬂow
ﬁeld, they would lead to ﬂux clumping. We ﬁnd that the inﬂows
from this parametrization are too weak to cause ﬂux clumping,
as was also motivated above.

Modiﬁed parameterized inﬂows (u = u (cid:102)∇B): With this
model, we aim for a parametrization of the inﬂows that more
closely resembles the observed ﬂows on our sample of compar-
atively small (and young) active regions, rather than the evolved
large active regions on which the parameters of the above model
(u∇B) are based. In order to capture both the spatial extent of the
ﬂows as well as their amplitude, we compared the extent of the
magnetic ﬁeld, smoothed with diﬀerent levels of spatial smooth-
ing, to the observed ﬂow ﬁeld. We found that the magnetic ﬁeld
smoothed with a Gaussian of σ = 2° has a similar extent as the
observed ﬂows. The observed average inﬂow velocities increase
from about 10 m s−1 at t90% to 40 to 50 m s−1 at t90% + 5 days. To
capture this evolution, we ﬁt a line between the observed ﬂow
velocities and the gradient of the smoothed magnetic ﬁeld at the
same location, for each twelve-hour time step. The ﬁt considers
the area of 20° × 20° around the center of the AR. We further se-
lected only those pixels that lie within 2° of an absolute magnetic

ﬁeld density above 20 Gauss. We then ﬁt a line to the relation be-
tween the ﬂow velocity and the gradient against time. We use the
slope and intercept of this ﬁt to calculate the normalization α in
Eq. 1 for each time step.

3.2. Diffusion models
We consider the cases where diﬀusion is the same for all ﬂux
elements (Dc), where it is ﬂux-dependent (Df), and without dif-
fusion (D = 0).

Constant diﬀusivity (Dc): In this model, the step length of
the random walk of each cork along each axis is drawn from
a normal distribution, with a standard deviation correspond-
ing to a diﬀusion rate D that is constant for all corks. We run
simulations with diﬀusivities in the range between D = 250
and 722.5 km2 s−1.

Flux-dependent diﬀusivity (Df): This model is based on De
Rosa & Schrijver (2006). In their simulation, they treated the
magnetic ﬁeld as ﬂux concentrations that can contain a vary-
ing amount of ﬂux and that can merge and break up. The ran-
dom walk step length ∆r of a ﬂux concentration depends on the
amount of ﬂux in the concentration as

∆r = C(|Φ|)

where |Φ| is the absolute ﬂux within a ﬂux concentration and D
is the diﬀusion rate (Schrijver 2001). This treatment of the mag-
netic ﬁeld is diﬀerent from our simulation, where we consider
individual corks that have a constant amount of ﬂux and perform
individual random walks. To implement a ﬂux-dependent diﬀu-
sion rate in our simulation comparable to De Rosa & Schrijver
(2006), at each simulation time step we calculate the cork den-
sity on a grid in longitude and latitude with grid spacing 0.4°,
oversample it 4x4 pixels and smooth it by 0.1°. For each cork,
we then calculate the width ∆r of the normal distribution from
which the random walk step length is drawn using the cork den-
sity at the corks’ position, with Eqs. 2 and 3. As reference diﬀu-
sivity D in Eq. 2, we use D = 250 km2 s−1.

No diﬀusion (D = 0): For one simulation using the observed
ﬂows, we add no diﬀusion. In this case, only the ﬂow ﬁeld dis-
places the magnetic ﬁeld.

4. Evaluation of the models
We run simulations using the four diﬀerent
inﬂow models
(Sect. 3.1) and the three diﬀerent diﬀusion models (Sect. 3.2),
on the sample of 17 active regions (Sect. 2). To evaluate the dif-
ferent simulations in comparison to the observations, we mea-
sure for each time step the total unsigned ﬂux within a disk of
the central 5°, as well as the cross correlation between the obser-
vations and the simulations. We then study diﬀerent simulation
start times.

4.1. Active region ﬂux as a function of time

In this section, we initialize the simulations of each AR with
the observed magnetic ﬁeld at the time tstart = t90% + 0.5 days.
In the simulations that use the observed ﬂow ﬁeld (uobs), stag-
nation points at which the velocities are zero have an inﬁnitely
small width. Magnetic ﬁeld therefore tends to accumulate in very
conﬁned spaces. To reduce the emphasis on these small-scale
features, we smooth the simulated magnetic ﬁeld maps with a

arrows are given in the lower left corners of each panel. Red (blue) indicates positive (negative) radial magnetic ﬁeld. All maps have the same
saturation, at ± the rounded maximum absolute ﬁeld strength in the central 10° from all simulation time steps. The green (black) contours indicate

step individually.

steps for four of the simulations along with the observations. In

the observations, the leading polarity moves in the prograde di-
rection and towards the equator over time. The trailing polarity
is deformed. Its ﬁeld disperses, and clumps of ﬂux leave the ﬂux
concentration. Both polarities loose ﬂux, due to ﬂux cancella-
tion between the two polarities as well as advection away from

sample), which is similar to the observed inﬂows (cf. Fig. 2).
Fig. D.1 shows the averaged magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂows from all
AR simulations and observations.

The ﬂux-dependent diﬀusivity Df (cf. Eq. 3) increases the
random walk step lengths of the magnetic ﬂux elements (corks)
in concentrations of weaker ﬁeld, and decreases it for corks
in concentrations of stronger ﬁeld. The active regions consid-
ered here have relatively low magnetic ﬁeld strengths (typically
below 100 Gauss). Therefore, the ﬂux-dependent diﬀusivity in-
creases the diﬀusivity for most of the ﬂux elements in the simu-
lation, and decreases it only for a small amount of ﬂux at the cen-
ter of some AR polarities. For comparison, we run simulations
with a range of constant diﬀusivities, from Dc250 = 250 km2 s−1
which corresponds to the reference value of Df, to Dc722.5 =
722.5 km2 s−1, in increments of 50 km2 s−1. Dc722.5 corresponds
to each cork experiencing no surrounding magnetic ﬂux in the
ﬂux-dependent model Df.

To evaluate how well the simulations reproduce the evolu-
tion of AR ﬂux in the observations, we calculate for each time
step the total unsigned ﬂux within a disk of the central 5°, in
the simulations and in the observations. The left panel of Fig. 4
shows the average total unsigned ﬂux of some of the simulations
as well as the observations as a function of time, calculated from
all regions in the sample, for Dc450 = 450 km2 s−1. Appendix E
shows the cases of Dc250 and Dc722.5. The results for (u∇B, Df),
(u (cid:102)∇B, Df), (u∇B, Dc450), and (u (cid:102)∇B, Dc450) are very similar to the
corresponding cases of (u = 0, Df) and (u = 0, Dc450), and are
therefore not shown in the left panel of Fig. 4.

Flux loss in active regions is the result of cancellation of op-
posite polarity ﬂux as well as advection of ﬂux away from the
region. With our simulation, we can measure how much ﬂux is
lost in each of these processes separately. The change in total
unsigned ﬂux within an area from one time step to the next can
be written as:
Φ(t + ∆t) = Φ(t) + Φa_in − Φa_out − Φc,

Fig. 5. Evolution of the average cross correlation between the observed
ﬁeld and the simulations. The error bars indicate the standard error over
the sample. The data point at t90% + 0.5 days is the initial condition of
the simulations.

In the simulations using the observed ﬂows, the motions of
the polarities resemble those in the observations (cf. the green
and black contours in ﬁrst and second row in Fig. 3, and second
row from top in Fig. C.1). This indicates that the supergranula-
tion, which is the dominant signal in the ﬂow maps, is eﬀective
in buﬀeting the magnetic ﬁeld polarities. Fig. 3 also shows the
diﬀerences in the ﬂow ﬁelds of the diﬀerent models: The pa-
rameterized inﬂow model, u∇B, yields extended ﬂows with low
velocities on the order of 5 m s−1 (up to about 10 m s−1 for larger
ARs in the sample). The modiﬁed parameterized inﬂow model,
u (cid:102)∇B, yields more conﬁned ﬂows with higher velocities on the
order of 20 m s−1 (up to about 40 m s−1 for larger ARs in the

where Φ(t) is the total unsigned ﬂux in the area at time t, ∆t is the
simulation time step of 30 min, Φa_in is the ﬂux advected into the
area, Φa_out is the ﬂux advected out of it, and Φc is the ﬂux lost
due to cancellation of opposite-polarity ﬁeld. In our simulation,
this corresponds to counting all corks that move into or out of
the AR area or cancel with an opposite-polarity cork. As the AR
area, we use the central disk with radius 5°.

The right panel of Fig. 4 shows the total amount of ﬂux lost
between the starting time tstart = t90% + 0.5 days and ﬁve days
later, for all nine simulations. The black line indicates the ﬂux
loss in the observations over the same period. Appendix E shows
the simulations with Dc250 and Dc722.5, which are within the error
consistent with the observations as well. The diﬀusivities that are
consistent with the observed ﬂux loss therefore range from about
250 to 720 km2 s−1. In Appendix F, we derive an analytical so-
lution of the ﬂux loss due to cancellation between two diﬀusing
Gaussian distributions, in the case of no ﬂow ﬁeld and constant
diﬀusion. This is in good agreement with the ﬂux loss due to can-
cellation in the corresponding simulation. With this small sample
of ARs, and a time period of only 5 days, we cannot constrain
the diﬀusivity further.

Fig. 4 also shows that the total amount of ﬂux loss is very
similar for all models that use the same diﬀusion model (Df or
Dc). Increasing the strength of the inﬂows (no inﬂows u = 0,
weak inﬂows u∇B, stronger inﬂows u (cid:102)∇B) leads to both more ﬂux
loss due to ﬂux cancellation and less ﬂux loss due to advection,
for both diﬀusion models. These two eﬀects partially cancel out,
such that the net eﬀect of the parameterized inﬂow models on
the evolution of AR ﬂux is small. In conclusion, the inﬂows are
not important in the evolution of the ﬂux budget of the AR in
the ﬁrst ﬁve days, but might play a role in the distribution of the
surrounding ﬁeld.

In all three simulations that use the observed ﬂows, the mag-
netic ﬂux loss is consistent with that in the observations. The
two models that include additional diﬀusion (blue triangles and
ﬁlled circles) loose more ﬂux than the simulation that uses the
observed ﬂow ﬁeld and no additional diﬀusion (blue circles).
This is because the additional random walk diﬀusion adds to the
diﬀusion from the supergranulation and therefore enhances can-
cellation. We conclude that the bulk transport from supergranu-
lation provides a means by which ﬂux is carried away from the
active region, which is consistent with a diﬀusion process.

4.2. Cross correlation as a function of time

As a second evaluation of the simulations, we calculate the cross
correlation between the observed and the simulated magnetic
ﬁeld, in a window of 10° × 10° around the center of each map
for each of the 17 ARs. The window size is chosen to exclude
other active regions in the ﬁeld of view, which emerge at a later
time or are signiﬁcantly larger than the target active region, such
that they exhibit moat ﬂows (see for example the lower right
corner in the top left panel of Fig. 3) As in Sect. 4.1, we use the
simulations that are initialized at t90% + 0.5 days.

Fig. 5 shows the average cross correlation of the simulations
with the observations as a function of time. The cross correlation
decreases monotonically for all simulations that use no or pa-
rameterized ﬂows. The diﬀerences between the simulations with
the same diﬀusion model and diﬀerent ﬂow models indicate that
the small-scale distribution of the ﬁeld is diﬀerent. Comparing
the simulations with the same ﬂow model and diﬀerent diﬀusion
models, the cases with ﬂux-dependent diﬀusivity Df have higher
cross correlations to the observations than the Dc450 cases. This
is within the error bars, however. The simulation using the ob-

case of constant diﬀusivity is 250 km2 s−1.

served ﬂow ﬁeld and no additional diﬀusion (uobs, D = 0) has a
lower correlation to the observations than the other models for
most of the four days of simulation time, whereas the two simu-
lations using the observed ﬂow ﬁeld and additional diﬀusion re-
main at a constant cross correlation (within errors) from 2-3 days
onward. In the last few time steps, the cross correlation of these
is larger than for cases with no or parameterized ﬂows. The low
cross correlation in the uobs, D = 0 case is a result of ﬂux be-
ing dragged by the ﬂow into a diﬀerent supergranular downﬂow
lane in the simulation than in the observation. The additional dif-
fusion in the cases of (uobs, Dc450) and (uobs, Df) mitigates this,
which therefore have a higher cross correlation.

4.3. Changing the simulation start time
In Sects. 4.1 and 4.2, we studied simulations initialized at t90% +
0.5 days. Here, we examine the dependence on the initial con-
dition of the simulation, by initializing the simulation with the
magnetic ﬁeld at times t90% − 1 day, t90% − 0.5 days, t90%, and
t90% + 1 day.

Fig. 6 shows the total unsigned ﬂux for the simulations
initialized at the ﬁve diﬀerent starting times, at 4.5 days af-
ter the initial condition of each simulation (that is, the same
time has elapsed for all simulations). The simulations starting
at t90% + 0.5 days yield the highest ﬂuxes, because this time most
often coincides with the time of peak ﬂux of the active regions.
Starting at later and earlier times decreases the AR ﬂux in the
simulations. In the two cases starting before t90%, the simulated
ﬁelds diﬀer largely from the observations, as most of the ﬂux has
not yet emerged onto the surface.

5. Discussion

In this work, we compared the observed evolution of 17 emerg-
ing active regions with surface ﬂux transport simulations of these
regions. We considered nine types of simulations with diﬀer-
ent models for diﬀusion and surface ﬂows. We used models
where the diﬀusion is zero, where it is the same for all ﬂux ele-
ments, and where it is ﬂux-dependent. For the surface ﬂows, we
used observations from local correlation tracking, parameterized
models of the inﬂows around active regions, as well as no ﬂows.

We compared the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in the obser-
vations and the simulations by calculating the cross correlation
as well as the total unsigned ﬂux of the ARs for all time steps.
In addition, we tested the validity of the transport simulation for
the study of young ARs by varying the starting time of the sim-
ulations relative to the time when the bulk of the AR ﬂux has
emerged.

We ﬁnd that simulations using the observed ﬂows can de-
scribe the evolution of the total unsigned ﬂux of the ARs starting
from the time when 90 % of the AR ﬂux has emerged. The su-
pergranular motions act as a random walk process in buﬀeting
the magnetic ﬁeld polarities. This ﬁnding from our simulation
complements the observations by Schunker et al. (2019), who
measured the standard deviation of the positions of AR polari-
ties and draw the same conclusion. However, from our simula-
tion we cannot make a statement whether the buﬀeting is ﬂux-
dependent or not. Additional diﬀusion improves the small-scale
structure (measured as the cross correlation). Our ﬁndings al-
low for diﬀusion rates from the supergranular motions between
250 to 720 km2 s−1. The large range is due to the small sample
of active regions which was suited for this study, as well as the
limitation to about ﬁve days for the simulations.

The converging ﬂows around emerging active regions, which
we included as parameterized models, increase ﬂux cancellation
in the AR in the ﬁrst ﬁve days after 90 % of the AR peak total
unsigned ﬂux have emerged. The resulting decrease in total un-
signed ﬂux is balanced by the decreased advection away from
the AR, such that the evolution of the total ﬂux associated with
the AR is similar in the diﬀerent models.

Appendix B: Flow ﬁeld balancing diffusion

We want to analyze the inﬂuence of the model inﬂows on the
evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld. For this, we calculated the ﬂow
ﬁeld that compensates the diﬀusion of a ﬂux distribution, and
compared it with the model inﬂows. For the magnetic ﬁeld, we
considered a 2D Gaussian distribution:

(B.2)

where B is the radial magnetic ﬁeld, u is the ﬂow ﬁeld, and D
is the diﬀusivity. In the situation where the advection and the

diﬀusion balance each other, such that ∂B

to

∇ · (uB) = D∇2B.

Fig. B.1 shows a latitudinal cut through the center of a 2D Gaus-
sian with a full width at half maximum of 2.4° and a peak ﬁeld
strength of about 100 Gauss, along with the corresponding pa-
rameterized inﬂow models (green and purple lines) and the ﬂow
ﬁeld which balances the eﬀect of diﬀusion, from Eq. B.7. The
ﬁgure shows that the u∇B inﬂow model has velocities that are
too low to compensate the diﬀusion. The u (cid:102)∇B model is similar
to the diﬀusion within ±2° of the center of the ﬁeld distribution,
and in fact can overcome the diﬀusion, leading to ﬂux clumping.

Appendix D: Average simulation

Diﬀusion broadens the Gaussian distribution over time as

Fig. D.1 shows two time steps of the average over the 17 ARs,
for each simulation.

Appendix E: Changing the diffusivity

Figs. E.1 and E.2 show the total unsigned ﬂux over the cen-
tral disk with radius 5° for constant diﬀusivities of 250 and
722.5 km2 s−1, respectively. The case Dc250 corresponds to the
diﬀusivity which serves as reference for the ﬂux-dependent dif-
fusivity Df. The case Dc722.5 corresponds to the ﬂux-dependent
model Df in the case that all corks experience no surrounding
magnetic ﬂux.

Appendix F: Analytical solution for constant

diffusion and no ﬂows

We derive an analytical description of the evolution of the ﬂux
loss. For this, we consider the simplest case, with no ﬂow ﬁeld
acting on the magnetic ﬁeld (u = 0), and with constant dif-
fusivity (Dc). Because diﬀusion acts independently per dimen-
sion, we can use a 1D setup. For the magnetic ﬁeld, we consider
two Gaussian distributions of opposite sign, centered at positions
±∆x from the origin:

B±(x, σ) =

For small ∆x, the diﬀerence between B+ and B− can be written
as

The total ﬂux loss over time can thus be written as

with suitable initial condition tin = ∆x2

To compare this to the simulation results, we consider an
average ∆x = 1.8° (compare in Fig. D.1 the distance of the
polarities from the center in the x-direction) and a time of
5 days. With a total unsigned ﬂux of 1.65 × 1021 Mx at the start
time tin = t90% + 0.5 days, Eq. F.7 gives for the three cases
of Dc250 = 250 km2 s−1, Dc450 = 450 km2 s−1, and Dc722.5 =
722.5 km2 s−1 ﬂux losses of 0.39 × 1021 Mx, 0.56 × 1021 Mx and
0.71 × 1021 Mx, respectively. This is in good agreement with the
ﬂux losses due to diﬀusion (solid bars) in the simulations with
the corresponding model of (u = 0), (Dc), as shown in Fig. E.1,
Fig. 4, and Fig. E.2, respectively. The total ﬂux loss in the obser-
vations over this time is 0.66 × 1021 Mx.

From Eq. F.7, we calculate the minimum and maximum dif-
fusivities Dmin, Dmax that are consistent with the observed ﬂux
loss after 5 days to a 2-σ level. These are Dmin = 280 km2 s−1
and Dmax = 1350 km2 s−1, respectively. We note that this does
not include ﬂux loss due to transport away from the AR, which
explains why Dmin is larger than Dc250.

Fig. D.1. Two example time steps of the observations and the simulations, averaged over the individual ARs. The two columns on the left show
the ﬁrst time step after simulation start, that is, 0.5 days after tstart = t90% + 0.5 days. The two columns on the right show the time step at the end of
the simulations, at t90% + 5.5 days. The times are indicated in the upper right corner of the top left panels. At each of the two time steps, the top
row shows the observed magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂows (left) and the simulation using observed ﬂows and no additional diﬀusion (right). For all other
rows, the left (right) panels show simulations with constant (ﬂux-dependent) diﬀusivity Dc (Df). From second row to bottom: observed ﬂows,
ﬂows according to the parameterized inﬂow model, ﬂows according to the modiﬁed parameterized inﬂow model, and no ﬂows. The diﬀusion in
the cases of constant diﬀusivity is 250 km2 s−1. The arrows indicate the observed and the parameterized ﬂows, for the respective observations and
simulations. Reference arrows are given in the lower left corners of each panel. Red (blue) indicates positive (negative) radial magnetic ﬁeld. All
maps have the same saturation, at ± the rounded maximum absolute ﬁeld strength in the central 10° from all simulation time steps. The green
(black) contours indicate levels of half and quarter of the minimum and maximum magnetic ﬁeld in the central 10° of the observation (of each
simulation), for each time step individually.

Fig. E.1. Left: Evolution of the total unsigned ﬂux over the central disk with radius 5°, averaged over the sample of active regions, for the
observations and some of the simulations. The error bars indicate the standard error over the sample. Only every sixth error bar is plotted, for
readability. The data point at t90% + 0.5 days is the initial condition of the simulations. The diﬀusion in the simulation with constant diﬀusivity and
no ﬂows is 250 km2 s−1. Right: The amount of ﬂux loss between the last time step of the simulations, at t90% + 5.5 days, and the time when the
simulations are initialized, at t90% + 0.5 days. The black line indicates the ﬂux loss in the observations over the same period, the gray shaded area
indicates the standard error. The solid and contoured bars indicate ﬂux loss due to cancellation and advection, respectively.

Fig. E.2. Same as Fig. E.1, with a diﬀusion in the cases of constant diﬀusivity for the parameterized ﬂow models at 722.5 km2 s−1.
