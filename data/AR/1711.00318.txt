News on mean pion multiplicity from NA61/SHINE

Michał Naskr ˛et1(cid:63) for the NA61/SHINE Collaboration

1Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Wroclaw

Abstract. NA61/SHINE is a large acceptance ﬁxed target experiment at the CERN SPS
which studies ﬁnal hadronic states in interactions between various particles and nuclei [1].
The main topic of this contribution are preliminary results for mean negatively charged
pion multiplicities (cid:104)π−(cid:105) from central Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions. The data were taken
recently by the NA61/SHINE collaboration for a wide range of beam momenta. Mea-
sured rapidity distributions dn
dy were extrapolated to unmeasured regions to obtain total
multiplicities (cid:104)π−(cid:105). A new scheme to calculate the mean number of wounded nucleons
(cid:104)W(cid:105) utilizing the EPOS MC model is described. Using data from other experiments, a
comparison of (cid:104)π(cid:105)
(cid:104)W(cid:105) for diﬀerent collisions and beam momenta is discussed.

1 π− rapidity distributions

The starting point of the analysis described herein are double diﬀerential spectra d2n
of negatively
dyd pT
charged hadrons, where y and pT are rapidity and transverse momentum of partcles, respectively.
Centrality was determined by selecting the 5% of collisions with the smallest forward going energy
as measured by the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) [1].

The spectra were obtained from reconstructed tracks applying a series of quality cuts. In order to
correct for trigger and reconstruction ineﬃciencies, one needs to apply a Monte Carlo correction. To
this end, the EPOS MC [2] is used in NA61/SHINE. A large statistics of ion collisions is generated and
particles are accumulated in bins ni, j
gen in transverse momentum pT versus rapidity y. The generated
data undergo the regular reconstruction procedure. Selecting negatively charged pions results in the
distribution ni, j
sel. The correction factor ci, j is then calculated as the ratio of the two Monte-Carlo
generated spectra ci, j = ni, j

sel. The ﬁnal experimental spectra are obtained as ni, j = ni, j

In order to estimate the mean π− multiplicity in the full acceptance, one needs to extrapolate
the experimental data to unmeasured regions. The extrapolation process consisted of two steps -
extrapolation in transverse momentum pT for each bin of rapidity y and extrapolation of dn/dy in
rapidity. For the latter a sum of two Gaussian functions was ﬁtted, g(y) = gT(y) + gP(y), where

In order to calculate the mean negatively charged pion multiplicity (cid:104)π−(cid:105), the following formula

was utilized:

Thus the ﬁnal result is the sum over measured values of dn/dy in the acceptance region and
the integral over the Gaussian ﬁts outside. Statistical uncertainties were calculated and systematic
uncertainties were assumed to be 5% based on the previous NA61 analysis of p+p collisions [3].

2 The mean number of wounded nucleons

The number of wounded nucleons can not be measured experimentally in NA61/SHINE. It has to be
calculated using Monte Carlo models. Two models were used to perform calculations - Glissando
2.73 [4] based on the Glauber model and EPOS 1.99 (version CRMC 1.5.3) [2] using a parton ladder
model. Glissando provides values that are consistent with previous measurements and applicable to
the wounded nucleon model [5]. EPOS, on the other hand, allows for more detailed centrality analysis
and event selection. It is possible to reproduce Glauber-based (cid:104)W(cid:105) values in EPOS and they are in good
agreement with Glissando as shown in Fig. 1, where both - statistical and systematic uncertainties are
calculated and combined. Therefore, Glauber-based EPOS values are used in later considerations.

3 Results

Preliminary π− rapidity spectra for Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions are presented in Fig. 2

Preliminary results on (cid:104)π−(cid:105) and (cid:104)W(cid:105) were calculated according to procedures described in sec-

tions 1 and 2. These are presented in Table 1 for Ar+Sc and Be+Be collisions.

In order to compare results obtained for diﬀerent systems, an isospin correction should be taken

into account. To this end phenomenological formulas are used

The correction is only applied to measurements where its eﬀect is the strongest. This assumption
is based on the compilation of the world data presented in [6] and the model presented therein. Where
needed, the data is corrected for slight diﬀerences in beam momentum. Applying this correction one

onset of deconﬁnement is predicted by the SMES [7] model due to the larger number of eﬀective
degrees of freedom in comparison to the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model.

As for the NA61 Ar+Sc, Be+Be and p+p data only the value of (cid:104)π−(cid:105) was obtained, the multiplici-
ties of (cid:104)π+(cid:105) and (cid:104)π0(cid:105) are approximated by multiplying the previously isospin asymmetry corrected π−
multiplicities by a factor 3: (cid:104)π(cid:105) = 3(cid:104)π−(cid:105). This approach is motivated by the fact that the NA61/SHINE
acceptance is the largest for π−. The energy dependence of the (cid:104)π(cid:105)/(cid:104)W(cid:105) ratio is presented in Fig. 4.
The Be+Be results follow p+p whereas the Ar+Sc measurements follow Pb+Pb. No simple system-
atics are observed at low SPS energies. This might be caused by diﬀerent physics processes and/or
systematic bias in the estimate of (cid:104)W(cid:105). Full simulation of the fragmentation process and PSD response
is needed in order to reduce the latter uncertainty.

4 Conclusions

Preliminary results on π− rapidity spectra and multiplicities in central Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions
at the CERN SPS are presented. Total multiplicities as function of collision energy and ratios with
the average number of wounded nucleons were obtained. These new results are compared to previous
measurements on nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus interactions. Results from Be+Be are similar
to those from nucleon-nucleon collisions whereas results from Ar+Sc follow those obtained in Pb+Pb
reactions at higher SPS energies.
