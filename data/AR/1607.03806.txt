ABSTRACT
We studied the developing conditions of sigmoid structure under the inﬂuence of magnetic non-potential
characteristics of a rotating sunspot in the active region (AR) 12158. Vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements from
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and coronal EUV observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveal
that the erupting inverse-S sigmoid had roots in the location of the rotating sunspot. Sunspot rotates at a
rate of 0-5deg/h with increasing trend in the ﬁrst half followed by a decrease. Time evolution of many non-
potential parameters had a well correspondence with the sunspot rotation. The evolution of the AR magnetic
structure is approximated by a time series of force free equilibria. The NLFFF magnetic structure around the
sunspot manifests the observed sigmoid structure. Field lines from the sunspot periphery constitute the body
of the sigmoid and those from interior overly the sigmoid similar to a ﬂuxrope structure. While the sunspot
is being rotating, two major CME eruptions occurred in the AR. During the ﬁrst (second) event, the coronal
current concentrations enhanced (degraded) consistent with the photospheric net vertical current, however the
magnetic energy is released during both the cases. The analysis results suggest that the magnetic connections
of the sigmoid are driven by slow motion of sunspot rotation, which transforms to a highly twisted ﬂux rope
structure in a dynamical scenario. An exceeding critical twist in the ﬂux rope probably leads to the loss of
equilibrium and thus triggering the onset of two eruptions.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is generally believed that major solar eruptions includ-
ing ﬂares and coronal mass ejections are powered by the free
energy stored in the stressed magnetic ﬁelds in the so called
active regions (ARs). These stressed ﬁelds transport magnetic
energy and helicity during the evolution of ARs primarily by
the mechanisms of ﬂux emergence from sub-photosphere and
the foot point shearing motions at the photosphere. Of the
many important features, sunspot rotations are a form of un-
commonly observed motions, lasting for even days, during the
evolution of the ARs (Evershed 1910; Bhatnagar 1967; McIn-
tosh 1981; Brown et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2007), which are
suggested to be efﬁcient mechanisms to inject helicity and en-
ergy (e.g., Stenﬂo 1969; Barnes & Sturrock 1972; Amari et al.
1996; Tokman & Bellan 2002; Török & Kliem 2003).

With the increase of observational capabilities both in sen-
sitivity and resolution, sunspot rotation had drawn a consid-
erable attention in an attempt to explain its characteristics in
association with the transient activity. A majority of the stud-
ies based on observations examined the relationship between
the sunspot rotation and coronal consequences (Brown et al.
2003; Tian & Alexander 2006; Tian et al. 2008), ﬂare pro-
ductivity (Yan et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2008; Suryanarayana
2010), the association of ﬂares with abnormal rotation rates
(Hiremath & Suryanarayana 2003; Jiang et al. 2012b), non-
potential parameters (Zhang et al. 2007; Kazachenko et al.
2009; Vemareddy et al. 2012a), helicity injection (Vemareddy
et al. 2012b) etc.

Numerical MHD investigations also helped greatly in un-
derstanding the relationship between sunspot rotation and the
eruptive activity by studying the formation and evolution of
ﬂux ropes by twisting line-tied potential ﬁelds (Mikic et al.

vemareddy@iiap.res.in

1990; Amari et al. 1996; Galsgaard & Nordlund 1997; Ger-
rard et al. 2002). The underlying idea of these simulations is
to show that the photospheric vortex motions can twist the
core magnetic ﬁeld in an active region upto a point where
equilibrium can no longer be maintained and thus the twisted
core ﬁeld i.e., ﬂux rope, erupts (Tokman & Bellan 2002;
Török & Kliem 2003; Aulanier et al. 2010; Amari et al. 2010).
At the instance of reaching exceeding critical twist, the ﬂux
rope is subjected to helical kink instability (Török & Kliem
2005). Depending on the decay rate of restoring force by
overlying ﬁeld, the progressive injection of the twist in the
underlying ﬂuxrope is shown to erupt as a conﬁned ﬂare or a
CME. As a secondary possibility, twisting motions could also
weaken the stabilizing overlying ﬁeld of ﬂux rope. Recent
numerical model by Török et al. (2013) demonstrates the ro-
tating sunspot as a trigger by inﬂating the ﬁeld passing over a
pre-existing ﬂuxrope resulting to weaken the downward ten-
sion force of the overlying ﬁeld. In retrospect however, the
twisting motions can twist both, the overlying ﬁeld and the
ﬂuxrope, because there is no pure current free ﬁeld to sta-
bilise the entire ﬂux rope system. Recent observational anal-
ysis (e.g., Vemareddy & Zhang 2014) indicates that the kink-
instability could be the onset of eruption bringing the ﬂuxrope
to a height range of inﬂating ﬁeld, from where the eruption is
further driven by torus-instability.

Although the above proof-of-concept simulations strikingly
explains and reproduce the many observed features of erup-
tions, not many observational studies exists to reconcile the
developing/formation scenario of ﬂux rope in the host active
region of rotating sunspot.
In the present paper, we study
the developing conditions of sigmoid structure under the in-
ﬂuence of non-potential characteristics of rotating sunspot in
an active region. Using uninterrupted, high cadence mag-
netic ﬁeld observations of AR 11158 at the photosphere, Ve-

mareddy et al. (2012a) reported an unambiguous correspon-
dence of sunspot rotation with many non-potential parame-
ters including energy and helicity deposition rates.
In that
AR, occurrence of the major ﬂares and CMEs are shown to
co-temporal with the peak rotation rates of sunspots (Jiang
et al. 2012b; Vemareddy et al. 2015).
Importantly, the ob-
served characteristics of those non-potential parameters could
have origins of sub-photospheric twist because the AR 11158
was emerging. So for the cause-effect relation, it would be of
great interest to investigate a case of sunspot rotation in post
phase of AR emergence, which is the subject of this article.
Motivated by these studies, we model the AR magnetic struc-
ture by non-linear force-free approximations and examined
the coronal ﬁeld topology and current distribution in favour
of ﬂuxrope. Observations are outlined in section 2, results, in-
cluding measurement of sunspot rotation, non-potential char-
acteristics, and force-free extrapolation are described in sec-
tion 3. Summary of the results with a discussion is presented

in section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS
The major source of observational data for our study is
from Solar Dynamic Observatory. Heliosesmic Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) captures full disc line-of-sight
magnetic ﬁeld measurements at a cadence of 45 s and vec-
tor magnetic ﬁelds at a cadence of 135s. For the sunspot
rotation study, we use continuum intensity observations at
45s cadence.
In order to quantify non-potentiality due to
the effect of sunspot rotation on the magnetic ﬁeld, we ob-
tained vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements at a cadence of
12 minutes provided after a pipelined procedures of inver-
sion and disambiguation (Bobra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al.
2014). The corresponding coronal activity is studied by multi-
thermal EUV images taken by Atmospheric Imaging Assem-
bly (AIA;Lemen et al. 2012) at a cadence of 12s.

refer to the sunspot anti-clock rotation. Dashed curves represent angular motion of some prominent features. Also note that the sunspot features encounter
slow/stop down during ﬁrst half of September 9. Vertical black strips correspond to data gaps and turquoise lines indicate the times of two eruptions.

The active region of interest was NOAA 12158 that ap-
peared on the solar disk during 5-14, September, 2014.
It
was located on the northern hemisphere at 15o latitude. It is
a pre-emerged active region with approximately bipolar mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration. During its disk passage, complex-
ity of magnetic conﬁguration ranges from simple α to αβγ.
Apart from small scale activity, two major CME eruptions
harboured, which are associated with M and X class ﬂares
from this AR. The coronal observations captured in multi-
wavelengths show a large scale sigmoidal structure. One of its
legs have roots from major sunspot of positive polarity. Dur-
ing the time interval of September 7-11, 2014, the compos-
ite images prepared from multi-layered observations present
multi-thermal plasma loops. During few sigmoid eruptions,
these images clearly identiﬁes the presence of hot sigmoid
channel surrounded by cool plasma loops (Figure 1 ﬁrst col-
umn panels). This sigmoid is regarded as a magnetic ﬂux rope
(Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2013; Vemareddy & Zhang
2014) to connect the theories of ﬂux rope based models to
explain the CME eruptions.

Vector magnetic ﬁelds taken by HMI show a main sunspot
of positive polarity surrounded by plague type distributed neg-
ative polarity. The overall chirality of the transverse vectors
aligns in left handed sense. This sense of chirality explains

the coronal geometry of magnetic loops which manifests a
reverse S-sigmoid (middle column panels of Figure 1). In-
terestingly, the motion images of these vector magnetograms
reveal rotation of this main sunspot in anti-clock while the
AR evolves persisting to this global sigmoidal structure. To
identify the photospheric magnetic connections of the coro-
nal plasma structures, we overlaid contours of magnetic con-
centrations. They unambiguously show that the sigmoid has
roots in that sunspot, indicating that the sunspot rotation has
a direct role in progressively building this sigmoidal struc-
ture. We used these magnetic ﬁeld observations to follow
the ﬂux motions due to sunspot rotation. By employing the
differential afﬁne velocity estimator for vector magnetograms
(DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008), we derived velocity ﬁeld of the
ﬂux motions. In Figure 1 (last column panels), the horizontal
velocity ﬁeld is overlaid on HMI continuum intensity maps.
The orientation of these velocity vectors conspicuously indi-
cate the swirling motion of ﬂuxes owing to sunspot rotation
in anti-clockwise direction. Especially, the ﬂuxes from West
part of penumbral region exhibits more of this apparent rota-
tion.

rate. Dotted vertical lines refer to timings of ﬂares associated with the two eruptions.

Qualitative measurements of the rotating sunspots are done
by preparing the stack plots of a radial section in the penum-
bra (Brown et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2008; Vemareddy et al.
2012a)). The idea essentially is to track the motion of any
penumbral feature in time while sunspot rotates about its um-
bral center (Figure 2(a)). For this, the penumbral region is un-
stretched (anti-clock direction from west) by remapping onto
radius-theta plane. We used continuum intensity images from
HMI at a cadence of 12 minutes. A snapshot of such an un-
stretched penumbra in Figure 2(a) of our sunspot of interest

is shown in Figure 2(b). The stack plots (space-time) are then
made by assembling slits taken at a radial position sequen-
tially in time. In panels (c) and (d) of Figure 2, the stack plots
prepared from two different radial positions (5 and 10 pixels
from umbra and penumbra boundary) are shown. Since this
sunspot rotates in anti-clock direction, we can see the fea-
ture motion in increasing angle. The inclination, in time, of
penumbral ﬁbrils also delineates a similar physical motion.
From these stack plots, we have followed prominently ob-
served feature (dashed yellow curves) motion to derive infor-

mation about the rate of rotation. Note the feature like white
curve is an artifact due to missing data in a row (viz. Fig-
ure 1(last column)) of intensity image frames.

From the curves, different features have varying rotation
rates in time. Most of the features disappear (or fall into um-
bra) in a short period of time. Hence it is difﬁcult to track
the rotation uniquely with the same feature. On September
7, feature motion is steep followed by slowing motion on
September 8. In the ﬁrst quarter of September 9, the features
stagnated in time. This suggests the slowdown of sunspot
rotation as also found in the case of AR 11158 (Vemareddy
et al. 2012a, 2015). The magnetic tension in the ﬁeld lines
connecting the sunspot and the opposite negative polarity is
suggested to play predominant role in the slowdown of the
sunspot rotation. As sunspot rotates slowly, the magnetic
stress in the ﬁeld lines from the sunspot increasingly builds.
After a critical point, the tension in these ﬁeld lines oppose
any further rotation. This critical state can also be regarded
as non-potential due to stored energy. At this point, any kind
of instability may trigger the release of energy. Not surpris-
ingly, a CME eruption is launched at 23:00UT on September
8, followed by M4.6 ﬂare at 23:12UT. In AR11158 also, at the
time (18:00UT on February 14, 2011) of slowdown of sunspot
rotation, a major CME eruption triggered followed by M2.2
ﬂare. This observation is a direct consequence of often ob-
served sunspot rotation in horboring the powerful CMEs. The
cause of sunspot rotation is likely related to sub-photospheric
dynamics, which cannot be probed by photospheric observa-
tions.

Once the tension in the connected ﬁeld lines released by
an eruption, the sunspot rotation may continue depending
on the driving force beneath the photosphere. Here in our
case, after ﬁrst eruption, the sunspot rotates till September 11.
The feature motion is ambiguous to infer any further cessa-
tion of rotation, however another powerful eruption launched
at 17:15UT on September 10, followed by an X1.6 ﬂare at
17:21UT. From these observational cases, we suggest that the
slowdown of the sunspot rotation is an indicator of a trigger-
ing major powerful eruptions.

From the time proﬁles of the rotation, we derived rotation
rates (dθ/dt) of different features. We found them to rotate
at varying rates. A feature that retains long time have dθ/dt
of 0-4 deg/h. However, there are short lived features (6-8h,
in 0-100deg section) that rotate even fast upto 8deg/h. In all,
sunspot rotation is neither uniform in around it nor constant
over the time.

3.2. Evolution of magnetic non-potential parameters
Under the presence of unusual rotating sunspot in the active
region, it is imperative to study the evolution of magnetic non-
potentiality. It is quantiﬁed by many parameters, but few of
them that can be estimated with the photospheric vector mag-
netograms (B) are net vertical current,αav, helicity injection,
and poynting ﬂux etc. Vertical current distribution is calcu-
lated by

(Hagino & Sakurai 2004). The sign of this parameter gener-
ally gives the handedness or chirality of the magnetic ﬁeld.

ing DAVE4VM technique. Similarly, the magnetic energy

Procedures involving the estimation of these parameters are
widely described in many recent studies (e.g., Vemareddy
et al. 2012a,b; Liu & Schuck 2012; Vemareddy 2015) in dif-
ferent contexts. On following similar procedures, we calcu-
lated these parameters in this AR and plotted their time evo-
lution in Figure 3. The net ﬂux from north and south polarity
shows monotonous decrease from the start of the observation
interval.
Imbalance of the ﬂux content in the AR is in the
range of 7-11%. Net vertical current in the north (IN) polarity
1012A. On
is negative and varies from −3
the other hand, it is positive in the south polarity (IS) varying
1012A. As the sunspot keep rotates, the
from 3
shear in horizontal vectors keep increases, which in turn con-
tributes to the net vertical currents in the form of horizontal
ﬁeld gradients. As both of these currents have reached their
maximum values by the time of cessation of the sunspot rota-
tion. As per these current proﬁles, αav also shows ﬁrst increas-
10−8m−1 till the time of the ﬁrst eruption
ing trend upto −4.7
and then decreases followed by major eruption at 17:30UT on
September 10.

Moreover, the time proﬁle of dH/dt also exhibits a sim-
ilar trend as the net current and αav. The order of the esti-
mated values of dH/dt and ∆H are consistent with the ear-
lier studies (e.g., (Vemareddy et al. 2012b,a)).
It is worth-
while to point that the dominant net negative (positive) ver-
tical current in north (south) polarity signiﬁes a negative or
left handed nature of AR magnetic structure consistent also
with the helicity injection rate. All these proﬁles suggest that
the non-potentiality is a direct consequence of organized ﬂux
motions generated by the sunspot rotation. Energy ﬂux in-
jection is positive and is on the orders of 27 ergs per second.
The accumulated energy over the time interval before the oc-
currence of the eruption and the associated ﬂare is of the or-
ders of 32 ergs, that is sufﬁce to generate a ﬂare of magnitude
upto GOES class X. A similar observational results follows
from the study of sunspot rotation in AR 11158 (Vemareddy
et al. 2012b,a), where peak phase (in magnitude) of different
non-potential parameters coincides with the occurrence of the
major eruptions and associated ﬂares. This demonstrates that
the successive accumulation of non-potentiality is mainly due
to the surface motion (shear/twist) on the photosphere but not
the ﬂux emergence.

3.3. Non-Linear Force-Free modelling
In order to realise the effect of sunspot rotation on the ge-
ometry of the AR magnetic structure, we performed non-
linear force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation (Wiegelmann
2004; Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010) of the observed pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld-of-view of the boundary
ﬁeld covers full AR such that ﬂux is nearly balanced during
the entire time interval. To satisfy the force-free conditions,
the magnetic components are subject to the pre-processing
procedure (Wiegelmann et al. 2006). To facilitate tracing
ﬁeld lines in a large extent of volume, the observed bound-
ary is inserted in an extended ﬁeld-of-view and computa-
tions are performed on a uniformly spaced computational grid
256 representing a physical dimensions of
of 400
×
280 Mm3. Before this, we rebinned the obser-
292
vations to 1 arcsec/pixel. The NLFFF code is initiated with
linear force-free ﬁeld constructed from normal ﬁeld compo-
nent and a small value of force-free parameter.

With the extrapolated ﬁeld in the coronal volume above the
AR, we traced ﬁeld lines roughly according to the total cur-
rent (|J|) and total ﬁeld strength (|B|). This modelled struc-
ture is plotted in Figure 4 with Bz (panels a-c) and coronal
EUV observations (panels d-f) as the bottom boundary. Field
lines from the lower periphery of the sunspot correspond to
the middle section (body) of the sigmoid whereas those from
central part serve as overlying ﬂux system. Right J-section of
the sigmoid is highly curved due to more twisted ﬁeld lines
from the top periphery of the sunspot, where the modelled

structure differs signiﬁcantly. However, the ﬁeld lines closely
resemble the global magnetic structure of plasma loops of the
sigmoid and surrounding loops as the earlier modeling stud-
ies (Savcheva & van Ballegooijen 2009; Sun et al. 2012). As
sunspot rotates in anti-clockwise direction, the ﬁeld lines tend
to retain their connectivity, and appear as swirled in clockwise
direction. As a fact of high current density, the ﬂux system be-
tween the sunspot and its counterpart appears as hot channel
when observed in coronal AIA 131, 94Å wavelengths.

Now the entire magnetic system is evolving quasi statically,
because the driving boundary motion ( 1km/s) is far less than
the Alfven time scale of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore,
our static modelling cannot capture the features of rapid evo-
lution during sigmoid eruption. However, the gradual build
up, like ﬂux rope current channel, topology which are the
basic building blocks of eruption models (Török & Kliem
2005; Aulanier et al. 2010), can approximately be captured.
A close view of the magnetic structure around the sunspot re-
veals the effect of sunspot rotation as described in the earlier
sections (panel (c)). Due to this twisting motion especially at
the sunspot periphery, the ﬁeld lines rooted therein had a fan-
shaped structure (deviating from radial ones), the ﬁeld lines
rooted near to the center overly the earlier. The two J-sections
of the sigmoid are compact and curved which the NLFFF code
fails to reproduce exactly.

For a view of quasi-static evolution, in Figure 5(columns
1 and 2), we plotted the magnetic structure in the sigmoid at
different epochs of sunspot rotation. To capture the sheared

ﬁeld lines around the sunspot, ﬁeld lines are rendered accord-
ing to higher current density criteria. Highly sheared ﬁeld
lines originate from the lower periphery of the sunspot and
they lie mostly below 10Mm in height. The two J-sections
of the sigmoid are compact and curved which the NLFFF
code fails to reproduce exactly. In such a ﬂux system being
slowly driven by constant rotational motion, the formation of
the ﬂuxrope under the dynamic scenario is inevitable. More-
over, it appears that continuous sunspot rotation helps sustain
the ﬂuxrope structure throughout the evolution.

The current density characterises the non-potentiality of the
ﬁeld. The patterns of strong current concentrations serve as
a proxy to non-potential structure in the corona. Moreover,
current structures are regions where reconnection can occur to
convert magnetic energy to thermal and kinetic energy. Dense
distribution of current persists mostly around lower portion of
the sunspot upto a height of 10Mm. This immense coronal
current distribution is due to increasingly developing sheared
arcade interfacing the rotating sunspot and the surrounding
negative polarity at the lower half portion. We compute the

As J2 term is proportional to the Joule heating term, it thus
roughly represents the hot emission. This is indeed true in
our case. The strong current concentration around the sunspot
spatially coincides with the high intensity of EUV emission
in 304 Å images, especially south circular portion due to the
highly stressed magnetic ﬁeld.

To measure the magnetic ﬁeld line linkage, we also com-
pute the quashing factor QF (Titov et al. 2002). Higher value
of QF locates the quasi-separatrix layers which are the sources
of high current concentrations. The contours of QF on AIA
304Å observations are shown in Figure 5 (fourth column pan-
els). The traces of high QF-values roughly outline the sig-
moid in all the time shots. The difﬁculty of reproducing
curved, compact J-sections is well acknowledged due to not-
well enough observational sensitivity of HMI (Nindos et al.
2012; Sun et al. 2012; Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014). Ow-
ing to this difﬁculty, reproducing a ﬂux rope structure with
the extrapolation technique deemed to be a challenge and dif-

ferent treatments to the boundary observations (e.g., Jiang
et al. 2012a, 2014; Zhao et al. 2016) are being employed in
different extrapolation codes. The optimization code relies
on observed horizontal ﬁeld components and globally relaxes
toward force-free equilibrium. Without any treatment, the
model remarkably shows many similarities of the ﬂux rope
structure around the rotating sunspot. In the following, we ex-
plored the evolution of the magnetic structure around sunspot
over the time of two observed major eruptions.

3.4. Eruption event of September 8, 2014
A moderate eruption occurred in this AR at 23:50UT when
the AR is at disc location of E30N15. It generates a major
disturbance in the corona as a CME and M4.6 ﬂare. Figure 6
illustrates the dynamical scenario of this eruption event from
high cadence multichannel AIA observations. For a simulta-
neous view, two combinations of composites are considered in
this study. Composites prepared by AIA 94/335/193 channels
(middle row panels) clearly present a well-developed struc-
ture of sigmoid just before the main eruption. On the other

hand, the composites prepared by AIA 131/171/304Å (top
row panels) shows a rising continuous ﬂux thread (as a main
body of ﬂux rope) in the middle of the sigmoid channel.
This is also clear from difference images of 131Å where very
hot ﬂux rope channel essentially captured (bottom row pan-
els). This is consistent with recently settled debate on time-
instance of formation and appearance of the ﬂux rope (Zhang
et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2013; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014)
in the solar source regions. Here, the sigmoid structure (re-
garded as ﬂux rope) preformed preferably by the continuous
action of sunspot rotation, and we see its existence as a con-
tinuous ﬂux bundle (embedded in sheared arcade) only during
initiation (around 23:00UT, top row panels) of its slow rise
motion in hot channels.

Since the ﬂux rope is having magnetic connections with the
rotating part of the sunspot, kink-instability is likely to involve
in the onset of the ﬂux rope eruption by constantly injecting
twist into the ﬂux system constituting the main body of the
sigmoid. This can be checked by relating αav to twist number
in the coronal loop constituting the sigmoid (Leamon et al.
2003). Total twist T of the coronal magnetic loop, assuming
as a semicircle of length l with its footpoint separation dis-

tance d is given by

moid length is about 190Mm, the above expression implies
total twist of more than one turn (6.65 radians=1.05 turns,
note a 2π factor with turns). Note that high resolution and
high cadence observations may improve the calculations in
which case the α value, on average, may indicate kink-nature
of ﬁeld lines constituting the ﬂux rope. Reconnection with the
overlying ﬁeld lines (Antiochos et al. 1999) in a later phase
triggers the eventual eruption of this FR at 23:50UT, which
follows the commencement of M4.6 ﬂare. Unlike usual cases,
the progressive reconnection during post-ﬂare phase lasts for
10hours. Even after this long duration ﬂare event, the pre-
cursor sigmoid structure retains its geometry, indicating the
eruption as a partial one (Gilbert et al. 2007). The associated
CME was captured in LASCO/C3 ﬁeld-of-view and found to

which tells the height dependent energy content (e.g.,
Mackay et al. 2011). Using this expression, we compute po-
tential ﬁeld energy (Ep), total non-potential energy (E), and
free magnetic energy (E f ree = E − Ep) before and after the en-
hancement of the total current (.i.e., eruption event) in the AR
magnetic structure. They are plotted in Figure 8 with respect
to height from photosphere into the corona. We can see from
these height proﬁles that E and Ep are predominantly located
below 20Mm. Although they minutely differ from one an-
other, the E f curves well distinguished. E f is mainly situated
in the height range of 2Mm to 40Mm with a maximum at
about 6Mm.

From these proﬁles, we can calculate the global energy

sufﬁcient to power the observed ﬂare, the quantity is still
small for an eruption. The reason lies in the fact that the ob-
served ﬁeld components showed increased net vertical current
around this event, however snapshots just before and after this
event detects available free energy. Moreover, the required
energy for this M-class ﬂare releases from a localised region
by ﬁeld reconﬁguration and the averaging over entire volume
may not detect it over globally building scenario. Since the
eruption is associated with low speed CME, it is likely that
the released energy is small.

3.5. Eruption event of September 10, 2014
A second major eruption from AR 12158 occurred on
September 10, 2014 at 17:25UT. Since the AR is at disc lo-
cation of E5N15, the CME eruption is face-on to the Earth
and a halo CME at a linear speed of 1071km/s is registered
in LASCO white-light CME observations. Unlike the ear-
lier one, this event is a full successful eruption distinguished
by the speed of the CME and the nature of speed of recon-
nection associated with ﬂare which is X1.6. In Figure 9, we
displayed the snapshots of the coronal imaging observations
during the onset of the eruption. The eruption commences
from 16:45UT, since then the visibility of continuous trace
of ﬂux rope becomes apparent in the composite images of
131/171/304 Å. Increasingly enhanced emission all along the
sigmoid is likely be a consequence of reconnection in a thin-
ning current sheet that would form below the ﬂux rope (Gib-
son et al. 2006, second row panels of 94/335/193 compos-
ites). Like the earlier event, this event is also suggested to be
a consequence of helical kink instability triggered under the
continuous slow driven motion by the sunspot rotation. The
evidence comes from the analysis of localized distribution of
α as described for the previous event.

The ﬁeld structure seen in the snapshots around this event
also suggest a ﬂux rope (Figure 10). The core part is not as

have a linear speed of 230km/s1.

Visualization of the ﬁeld lines from rotating portion in the
sunspot suggests the development of the ﬂuxrope structure.
In Figure 7, we plotted those ﬁeld lines for the snapshots
around this eruption event. The lower ﬁeld lines are pro-
gressively sheared by the sunspot rotation and become twisted
core of the overlying less sheared ﬁeld lines. We then com-
pute the current density in a vertical cross-section plane (slice
SL) of this ﬂuxrope structure and plotted in the correspond-
ing panels of third column. Distribution of Bz in the same
slice planes is also computed and over plotted its contours

(
±
ﬁeld lines all along the polarity inversion line of the sunspot
and the negative polarity, the current distribution appears ex-
actly in a arcade shape and strong current concentration is
co-spatial with the polarity inversion line. With the develop-
ment of the twisted core structure, the current concentration
above the negative polarity enhanced (22:00UT panel). This
is obvious even from the time proﬁle of the net vertical cur-
rent (Figure 3), where surface integral of vertical current den-
sity increases rapidly (over a span of 5h) during this eruption
event. We emphasize the difﬁculty of capturing the twisted
or helical structures at the sigmoid sites due to lack of sufﬁ-
cient instrumental sensitivity for horizontal polarisation signal
(Hoeksema et al. 2014) and the model of boundary dependent
extrapolation as well. This issue deserves a separate study
with a different treatment of data driven simulation (e.g., Wu
et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2014) and would be our future investi-
gation.

strongly twisted as the earlier case but overlaid by sheared
arcade. Strong current concentrations due to sheared arcade
system of sigmoid are distributed upto the height of 15Mm
well before this eruption. These current concentrations are
located along and above the PIL owing to the stressed ﬁeld
between the sunspot and its surrounding opposite polarity.
Moreover, the appearance of ﬂuxrope in EUV channels is only
during the onset time, which is too highly dynamic to be fol-
lowed by the static models based on observed static photo-
spheric frames. Despite this known difﬁculty, the current dis-
tribution in the slice ’SL’ during pre-to-post eruption (from
top to bottom) phase, we note the degrading current concen-
trations, reﬂecting the indications of the ﬁeld transition from
non-potential sheared arcade to potential ﬁeld. Owing to this
fact, the energy estimations, as for the earlier event, also im-
plies a similar result of lowering free-energy.

In the top panel of Figure 11, we plot the horizontally inte-
grated total magnetic energy and potential energy as a func-
tion of height, before (06:00UT on September 10 2014) and
after (20:00UT on September 10 2014) the eruption. Because
the extrapolation problem is a boundary dependent, the cho-
sen times for this energy calculation are according to the time

proﬁle of the net vertical current (Figure 3, even αav) where
a drastic decrease of net vertical current in both polarity re-
gions is observed. Consistent with the current distribution, the
free-energy dominantly lies within 40Mm, peaking at around
6 Mm. The free-energy curve after eruption is well below to
that before eruption as a fact that the ﬁeld is relaxed and less
non-potential. During this static ﬁeld evolution at the back-
ground of the observed dynamic eruption, the energy release
1032erg, which is sufﬁcient to power
is estimated as 1.05
GOES class X1.6 magnitude ﬂare.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this work, we investigated the relation of sunspot rotation
with the major eruptions occurred in the vicinity of it. Vortex
like motions are modelled to be potential triggers of eruptions
in the ARs (Amari et al. 1996; Török & Kliem 2003; Török
et al. 2013) by progressively twisting the line-tied foot points.
Particularly, they involve in the formation or development of
twisted ﬂux ropes, and sigmoids by injecting twist and energy
in the AR magnetic structure (e.g., Ruan et al. 2014). We
found that the location of the sunspot rotation had the mag-
netic roots of the erupting sigmoid (associated to two CME

eruptions) that existed along the PIL between the sunspot and
the surrounding opposite polarity in the AR 12158 (Cheng
et al. 2015). Like the earlier reports (Vemareddy et al. 2012a),
the correspondence of sunspot rotation motion is obviously
reﬂected in the many non-potential parameters (Figure 3) dur-
ing the evolution of the AR. Unlike the earlier cases, this
AR is in the post-emerged phase with decreasing ﬂux con-
tent, which reveals a direct role of observed sunspot rotation,
a purely surface phenomenon of sub-photospheric origin, in
the two major sigmoid eruptions.

Since the driven motion by sunspot rotation is slow (of the
order of 1km/s), the evolution of the magnetic structure is said
to be quasi-static and therefore the evolution is approximated
by a time series of force-free equilibria (e.g., Sun et al. 2013;
Vemareddy & Wiegelmann 2014). Under this scenario, uti-
lizing HMI 12 minute cadence vector magnetic ﬁeld obser-
vations, the AR magnetic structure is reconstructed by NLFF
model, which reproduces the global structure in resemblance
with the coronal EUV plasma structure. The modeled mag-
netic structure around the rotating sunspot appears as a fan-
like sheared arcade, manifesting the observed sigmoid. Ac-
knowledging the difﬁculty in working with the noisy observa-
tions (Hoeksema et al. 2014), and also tracing the same struc-
ture in all time snapshots, the modeled ﬁeld indicates signa-
tures of accumulating strong coronal current concentrations
and a building sigmoid at different time instances.

While sunspot being observed to be rotating, a moderate
CME eruption occurred at 23:00UT on September 8, 2014.

During the onset of eruption, the AIA multi-thermal observa-
tions conspicuously present a continuous trace of hot ﬂux rope
embedded in the middle of ambient less hot sheared structure
(Zhang et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 2015; Vemareddy & Zhang
2014). The eruption is a partial one, where ﬂare reconnection
takes place slowly and accordingly a low speed CME asso-
ciated with a long duration M4.6 ﬂare is observed. Consis-
tent with the photospheric measurement of net vertical cur-
rent during pre-to-post eruption, an increased coronal current
concentration is being observed across the sigmoid as a fact
of twisting by sunspot rotation. As per these notices, the es-
timated free energy during the eruption is small, which we
believe to be averaging effect because energy releases locally
during ﬁeld reconﬁguration.

A second CME eruption launched at 17:30UT on Septem-
ber 10, 2014 in the AR. The CME is a halo heading toward
Earth at a high speed (1014km/s) and follows an X1.6 ﬂare.
Appearance of continuous ﬂux rope is evident amid the sig-
moid during the onset of the eruption. As per net vertical cur-
rent during this eruption event, the coronal current concentra-
tions degraded across the sigmoid and the free energy estima-
1031erg, which is sufﬁcient
tion indicates a release of 1.44
for an X-class ﬂare. These analysis results suggest that the
magnetic connections of the sigmoid are driven by slow mo-
tion of sunspot rotation, which developed to a highly twisted
ﬂux rope structure in a dynamical scenario. An exceeding
critical twist in the ﬂux rope explains the loss of equilib-
rium triggering the onset of the observed eruptions. Although

the NLFFF extrapolation worked best in reproducing highly
twisted structure around the sunspot, given the limitations of
both the observations and the model, a realization of a clear
ﬂux rope structure which is dynamic in nature, seem to be
difﬁcult task. Data driven MHD based models (e.g., Wu et al.
2006; Jiang et al. 2012a, 2014) would help in better explain-
ing the observed features in the eruptions under the inﬂuence
of sunspot rotation, which would be the subject of our future
investigations.

SDO is a mission of NASA’s Living With a Star Program.
This work used the DAVE4VM code, written and developed
by P. W. Schuck at the Naval Research Laboratory. 3D ren-
dering is due to VAPOR (www.vapor.ucar.edu) soft-
ware. The authors sincerely thank Dr. T. Wiegelmann for
providing NLFFF code. We acknowledge an extensive usage
of the multi-node, multi-processor high performance comput-
ing facility at IIA. P.V. is supported by an INSPIRE grant of
AORC scheme under the Department of Science and Technol-
ogy. X.C. is supported by NSFC under grants 11303016. We
thank the referee for constructive comments and suggestions
that helped improving the manuscript greatly.
