ABSTRACT

We present the analysis of the hot-Jupiter KELT-7 b using transmission and emission spectroscopy from the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST), both taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Our study uncovers a rich transmission
spectrum which is consistent with a cloud-free atmosphere and suggests the presence of H2O and H-. In contrast, the
extracted emission spectrum does not contain strong absorption features and, although it is not consistent with a simple
blackbody, it can be explained by a varying temperature-pressure proﬁle, collision induced absorption (CIA) and H-.
KELT-7 b had also been studied with other space-based instruments and we explore the eﬀects of introducing these
additional datasets. Further observations with Hubble, or the next generation of space-based telescopes, are needed
to allow for the optical opacity source in transmission to be conﬁrmed and for molecular features to be disentangled
in emission.

1. INTRODUCTION

With thousands of planets detected during the pre-
vious two decades, the study of atmospheres is at the
forefront of exoplanet research and spectroscopic obser-
vations now probe these worlds in search of molecular

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

features. Such studies are crucial in the pursuit of under-
standing the diverse nature of exoplanet chemical com-
positions, atmospheric processes, internal structures and
the conditions required for planetary formation.

In recent years, there has been a surge in tran-
sit spectroscopy observations using both space-borne
and ground-based facilities, resulting in signiﬁcant ad-
vancements in our understanding of exoplanet atmo-
spheres. This technique has been used for the detection
of multiple molecular absorption features, including wa-
ter (H2O, Tinetti et al. (2007); Tsiaras et al. (2019)),
methane (CH4, Swain et al. (2008)) and ammonia (Mac-
Donald & Madhusudhan 2017), becoming a cornerstone
technique in the pursuit of exoplanet characterisation.
In particular, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has
been widely used allowing us to characterise the atmo-
spheres of several hot Jupiters (e.g. Wakeford et al. 2013;
Deming et al. 2013; Haynes et al. 2015; Kreidberg et al.
2018; Mikal-Evans et al. 2019) and has begun to observe
enough planets for population studies to be undertaken
(e.g. Sing et al. 2016; Tsiaras et al. 2018).

For hotter planets, HST transmission spectroscopy
has provided evidence for absorption at shorter wave-
lengths. These are generally attributed to the pres-
ence of optical absorbers such as Titanium Oxide (TiO),
Vanadium Oxide (VO) or Iron Hydride (FeH). These
planets include WASP-121b (Mikal-Evans et al. 2019)
and WASP-127 b (Skaf et al. 2020). Additionally, high-
resolution ground-based observations have detected the
presence of a variety of heavy metals in the atmosphere
of KELT-9 b (Hoeijmakers et al. 2019) while lower res-
olution data were used to claim the presence of Alu-
minium Oxide (AlO) in WASP-33 b (von Essen et al.
2019). Thermal emission spectra can also be used to
characterise the day side of exoplanets.
In particular,
hot-Jupiters which emit signiﬁcant and detectable in-
frared radiation are the ideal candidates for this ap-
proach. As thermal emission is sensitive to the tem-
perature pressure proﬁle (Madhusudhan et al. 2014), it
is possible to probe this structure and demonstrate how
it can be driven by the presence of TiO in the atmo-
sphere such as in the cases of WASP-33 b (Haynes et al.
2015) and WASP-76 b (Edwards et al. 2020a).

The presence of these optical absorbers are an impor-
tant component in current exoplanet atmospheric mod-
els, and are predicted to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
overall physics and chemistry of highly irradiated close-
in giant planet atmospheres. Work by Fortney et al.
(2008) suggests the day side atmospheres of such planets
can be divided into two separate classes. The ﬁrst class
represents atmospheres which are modelled to have sig-
niﬁcant opacity due to the presence of TiO and VO gases

and thus results in, for example, atmospheric tempera-
ture inversions (with hot stratospheres). In the second
case, atmospheres which do not possess opacity due TiO
and VO, are modelled to redistribute absorbed energy
more readily resulting in cooler day-sides and warmer
night-sides.

WASP-103 b, a similar planet of KELT-7 b, has been
studied in both emission and transmission by HST, sug-
gesting a thermal inversion on the dayside but with
a featureless transmission spectrum (Kreidberg et al.
2018). On the other hand, HST data for WASP-76 b,
another ultra-hot Jupiter, also showed a dayside ther-
mal inversion due to the presence of TiO but a larger
water feature and no evidence for optical absorbers in
the transmission spectrum (Edwards et al. 2020a).

−0.18MJ , radius 1.533+0.046

KELT-7 b is a transiting hot-Jupiter, with mass
of 1.28+0.18
−0.047RJ , orbital period
2.7347749 ± 0.0000039 days and equilibrium tempera-
ture ∼2048 K (Bieryla et al. 2015) (see Table 2). KELT-
7 b, with relatively low surface gravity, high equilibrium
temperature, and a bright host star, is an excellent can-
didate for thorough atmospheric characterisation. It has
previously been studied in both transmission and emis-
sion using the Spitzer Space Telescope’s InfraRed Array
Camera (IRAC) (Garhart et al. 2020) and a ground-
based eclipse was measured by Martioli et al. (2018).
Here we present an analysis of this exoplanet using
transmission and emission spectroscopy from the Hub-
ble Space Telescope’s WFC3. These HST observations
allow for two complementary insights into the nature of
this planet. We also explore the eﬀects of combining the
HST dataset with those from Spitzer IRAC and TESS.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. Observational Data - HST

We obtained the raw spectroscopic observation data
from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes1. Both
observations of KELT-7 b were undertaken in 2017 as
part of Hubble proposal 14767 led by David Sing. These
images are the result of a two visits of the target, each
containing ﬁve HST orbits, using the infrared detector,
the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism, and a
scan rate of 0.9 s−1. Each image consists of ﬁve non-
destructive reads with an aperture size of 266 × 266
pixels in the SPARS10 mode, resulting in a total expo-
sure time of 22.317s, a maximum signal level of 33,000
e− per pixel, and a total scan length of about 25.605
arcsec.

2.2. Reduction and Extraction - Iraclis

1 https://archive.stsci.edu/

The data reduction and calibration was performed
using the open-source software Iraclis (Tsiaras et al.
2016b). Our Iraclis analysis starts with the raw spatially
scanned spectroscopic images. The data reduction and
correction steps are performed in the following order:
zero-read subtraction; reference pixel correction; non-
linearity correction; dark current subtraction; gain con-
version; sky background subtraction; calibration; ﬂat-
ﬁeld correction; bad pixels and cosmic ray correction.
Detailed description of the data reduction process could
be found in Section 2 of Tsiaras et al. (2016b).

Following the reduction process, the ﬂux was ex-
tracted from the spatially scanned spectroscopic images
to create the ﬁnal transit light-curves per wavelength
band. We considered one broadband (white) light-curve
covering the whole wavelength range in which the G141
grism is sensitive (1.088-1.68µm) and spectral
light-
curves with a resolving power of 70 at 1.4µm. The
bands of the spectral light-curves are selected such that
the SNR is approximately uniform across the planetary
spectrum. We extracted our ﬁnal light-curves from the
diﬀerential, non-destructive reads. Prior to light curve
ﬁtting, we choose to discard the ﬁrst HST orbit of each
visit, as these exhibit much stronger hooks than subse-
quent orbits (Deming et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2017).

Our white and spectral light-curves were ﬁt using the
literature values from Table 2, with only two free pa-
rameters: the planet-to-star radius ratio and the mid-
transit time. This is motivated by the Earth obscura-
tion gaps, which often means the ingress and egress of
the transit are missed, limiting our ability to reﬁne the
semi-major axis to star radius ratio, the inclination and
the eccentricity. The limb-darkening coeﬃcients were se-
lected from the quadratic formula by Claret (2000), and
using the stellar parameters in Table 2 and the ATLAS
stellar models (Kurucz 1970; Espinoza & Jord´an 2015;
Morello et al. 2020). Figure 1 shows the raw white light-
curve, the detrended white light-curve, and the ﬁtting
residuals for both observations while Figure 2 shows the
ﬁts of spectral light-curves for each wavelength.

2.3. Atmospheric characterisation - TauREx3

The reduced spectra obtained using Iraclis were there-
after ﬁtted using TauREx3 (Al-Refaie et al. 2019), a
publicly available2 Bayesian retrieval framework. For
the star parameters and the planet mass, we used the
values from Bieryla et al. (2015) listed in Table 2. In
our runs we assumed that KELT-7 b possesses a pri-
mary atmosphere with a ratio H2/He = 0.17. For the
opacity sources, we used the line lists from the ExoMol

project (Tennyson et al. 2016), along with those from
HITRAN and HITEMP (Rothman et al. 1987; Roth-
man et al. 2010). In this publication, we considered six
trace gases: H2O (Polyansky et al. 2018), CO(Li et al.
2015), TiO (McKemmish et al. 2019), VO (McKemmish
et al. 2016), FeH (Dulick et al. 2003; Wende et al. 2010)
and H- (John 1988; Edwards et al. 2020a). For H-, the
absorption depends only on the mixing ratios of neu-
tral hydrogen atoms and free elections. As this is a
degenerate problem, we ﬁxed the neutral hydrogen vol-
ume mixing ratio and imposed a proﬁle inspired from

Parmentier et al. (2018) using the two-layer model from
Changeat et al. (2019). The only remaining free param-
eter is log(e-). Clouds are modelled assuming a fully
opaque grey opacity model.

In this study we use the plane-parallel approximation
to model the atmospheres, with pressures ranging from
10−2 to 106 Pa, uniformly sampled in log-space with 100
atmospheric layers. We included the Rayleigh scatter-
ing and the collision induced absorption (CIA) of H2–
H2 and H2–He (Abel et al. 2011; Fletcher et al. 2018;
Abel et al. 2012). Constant molecular abundance pro-
ﬁles were used, and allowed to vary freely between 10−12
and 10−1 in volume mixing ratio. For the transit spec-
tra, the planetary radius, which here corresponds to the
radius at 10 bar, was allowed to vary between ±50% of
the literature value. In emission, we set the planet ra-
dius to the best-ﬁt value from our transmission retrieval.

The cloud top pressure prior ranged from 10−2 to
106 Pa, in log-uniform scale. For the day side, we do
not consider clouds in the model. In transmission, the
temperature-pressure proﬁle was assumed to be isother-
mal while in emission a 3-point proﬁle was used.

Finally, we use Multinest (Feroz & Hobson 2008; Feroz
et al. 2009a, 2013) with 1500 live points and an evidence
tolerance of 0.5 in order to explore the likelihood space
of atmospheric parameters.

2.4. Modelling Equilibrium Chemistry - petitCODE

To help contextualize our free retrieval results, we
computed a self-consistent forward model with petit-
CODE, a 1D pressure-temperature iterator solving for
radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium (Molli`ere
et al. 2015, 2017). The code includes opacities for H2,
H−, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, HCN, H2S, NH3, OH, C2H2,
PH3, SiO, FeH, Na, K, Fe, Fe+, Mg, Mg+, TiO and

VO, as well as radiative scattering and collision induced
absorption by H2–H2 and H2–He. The atmosphere com-
puted with petitCODE is assumed to be cloud-free, but
the possibility of condensing refractory species is in-
cluded in the equilibrium chemistry. Our petitCODE
model for KELT-7 b was computed using the stellar
and planetary parameters determined by Bieryla et al.
(2015). Here, the surface gravity was computed using
the planetary mass and radius. Furthermore, an in-
trinsic temperature of 600K was adopted, in accordance
with its high equilibrium temperature (Thorngren et al.
2019). Finally, a global planetary averaged redistribu-
tion of the irradiation was assumed.

2.5. Ephemeris Reﬁnement

Accurate knowledge of exoplanet transit times is fun-
damental for atmospheric studies. To ensure the KELT-
7 b can be observed in the future, we used our HST
white light curve mid time, along with data from TESS
(Ricker et al. 2014), to update the ephemeris of the
planet. TESS data is publicly available through the
MAST archive and we use the pipeline from Edwards
et al. (2020b) to download, clean and ﬁt the 2 minute
cadence data. KELT-7 b had been studied in Sector 19
and after excluding bad data, we recovered 9 transits.
These were ﬁtted individually with the planet-to-star
radius ratio (Rp/Rs) and transit mid time (Tmid) as
free parameters. We note that the ephemeris of KELT-
7 b was also recently reﬁned by Garhart et al. (2020)
and we also used the mid times derived in that study.

3. RESULTS

5

Our analysis uncovers a rich transmission spectrum
which is consistent with a cloud-free atmosphere and
suggests the presence of water and dissociated hydro-
gen, as shown by the posterior distributions in Figure
3. We calculate the Atmospheric Detectability Index
(ADI) Tsiaras et al. (2018) to be 16.8 for the trans-
mission spectrum, indicating strong evidence of atmo-
spheric features. The retrieved temperature of around
1400 K for the terminator region is consistent with the
expected value given the equilibrium temperature. How-
ever, as we are in temperature regime (Teq (cid:39) 2000 K)
where 3D eﬀects across the limb could occur, we may
be biased on the abundances and temperature retrieved
(Pluriel et al. 2020).

In contrast, the extracted emission spectrum does
not contain strong absorption or emission features. Al-
though the data is not consistent with a simple black-
body, as shown in Figure 4, it can be explained by a
varying temperature-pressure proﬁle and H-. We cal-
culate the ADI against a simple blackbody to be 19.6,
highlighting the poorness of the blackbody ﬁt and indi-
cating the presence of a detectable atmosphere. How-
ever, it could also indicate that 2D eﬀects, such as those
suggested by (Wilkins et al. 2014), are aﬀecting the ob-
served spectrum. In their study of CoRoT-2 b they ob-
served an emission spectrum similar to that of KELT-
7 b (i.e. one that is poorly ﬁt by a blackbody but which
can be better ﬁt using 2 blackbodies). Such inhomo-
geneities will certainly be important in the analysis of
emission data from future missions (Taylor et al. 2020).
Our best ﬁt favours a thermal inversion in the strato-
sphere of KELT-7 b. Although the lower part of the at-
mosphere has large temperature uncertainties (between
1000 K and 3000 K), the middle and top temperature-
pressure points are well-constrained enough to indicate a
thermal inversion with a temperature at the top between
2900 K and 3700 K as shown in Figure 5. Both trans-
mission and emission spectra, along with their best-ﬁt
solutions are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

The retrieved emission temperature-pressure proﬁle
closely agrees with the petitCODE simulations, both
showing a temperature inversion as shown in Figure 5.
The retrieved water abundance in transmission is consis-
tent with the predictions although the 1σ upper bound
in emission is below what is expected. For TiO, VO
and FeH, the upper bound place on their abundances
is signiﬁcantly above the amount expected from our pe-
titCODE simulations, suggesting the HST WFC3 data
is no sensitive enough for us to conclude on their pres-
ence/absence.

The transits of KELT-7 b from HST and TESS were
seen to arrive early compared to the predictions from

conﬁdence in blue while the HST WFC3 data is represented by the black data points.

Bieryla et al. (2015). As the observation did not in-
clude ingress or egress, the HST transit ﬁtting is not
as precise, and potentially not as accurate, as the
TESS data which captured the whole event. Using
this new data, we determined the ephemeris of KELT-
7 b to be P = 2.73476541±0.00000036 days and T0
= 2458384.425577±0.000099 BJDT DB where P is the
planet’s period, T0 is the reference mid-time of the tran-
sit and BJDT DB is the barycentric Julian date in the
barycentric dynamical. Our derived period is 0.84 s
and 0.063 s shorter than the periods from Bieryla et al.

(2015) and Garhart et al. (2020) respectively. The ∼10
minute residual of the TESS transits from the ephemeris
of Bieryla et al. (2015) show the necessity to regularly
follow-up transiting planets and for programmes such
as ExoClock3 to which our observations have been up-
loaded. By the launch of Ariel in late 2028, around
1400 orbits of KELT-7 b will have occurred since the T0
derived here and the diﬀerence in the predicted transit

times between the ephemeris from this work and from
Garhart et al. (2020) would be around 5 minutes. The
observed minus calculated residuals, along with the ﬁt-
ted TESS light-curves are shown in Figure 6 while the
ﬁtted mid times can be found in Table 3.

4. DISCUSSION
In transmission, H2O and H−, (log(H2O) = −4.34+1.41
−4.45
and log(H−) = −4.26+1.41
−2.42) are well deﬁned. As shown
in the posterior distributions in Figure 3, correlations

exist between the abundances of the molecules, particu-
larly between H2O and H−. We could expect to also ﬁnd
CO in such a hot atmosphere (Teq (cid:39) 2000K), evidence
for which has been seen for other hot Jupiters: WASP-
121b (Evans et al. 2017; Parmentier et al. 2018) and
WASP-33b (Haynes et al. 2015). However our retrieval
analysis on HST data only provides no evidence for the
presence of these molecules. We also explored the ad-

of the temperature-pressure proﬁles. The petitCODE model (black) features a thermal inversion at 1 mbar, because of absorption
by TiO and VO, and closely matches the retrieved proﬁle. Top right: Molecular abundances for the petitCODE simulation.
The equilibrium fractions of most molecules remain approximately constant for pressures higher than 1 mbar, but drop quickly
at lower atmospheric pressures due to thermal dissociation. Bottom left: Comparison of constrained molecular abundances in
transmission (dotted lines) to those from the petitCODE simulation (solid lines). The water abundance is seen to be within 1σ
of that which is predicted. Bottom right: Comparison of upper bounds placed on molecular abundances in emission to those
from the petitCODE simulation. The 1-σ upper bound on the water abundance is signiﬁcantly lower than the petitCODE
simulations.
In both transmission and emission, the 1-σ upper bounds on TiO, VO and FeH are well above the predicted
abundances, suggesting the data is not suﬃcient to comment on their presence/absence.

dition of Spitzer/IRAC and TESS data, see Section 4.1
for more details.

The non-detection of TiO and VO in the termina-
tor region agreed with predictions from Spiegel et al.
(2009). Their work suggests that in highly irradiated
atmospheres, similar to KELT-7 b, TiO and VO would
be likely to rain out in cold traps and disappear from
the visible atmosphere. Observational evidence for these
processes was reported in emission spectrum of Kepler-
13Ab Beatty et al. (2017). To overcome these eﬀects,
large advective mixing and higher temperatures (higher
than 1800K) would be required, leading to large abun-

dance of VO in the day side of the planet. However,
in our analysis, we do not ﬁnd evidence for VO or TiO
on the day side of KELT-7 b, which could be unravelled
with higher signal-to-noise in future observations such
as Ariel or JWST. Also, our analysis potentially ﬁnds
a large diﬀerence in the day/night temperatures with
thermal inversion on the dayside, which would indicate
that day and night side of the planet are poorly coupled
by large scale dynamical processes, thus preventing VO
and TiO from reaching the cold night side and conden-
sating. Fortney et al. (2008) postulated that the pres-
ence of optical absorbers would lead, and require, large

that TiO and VO are present but simply beyond the

4.1. Addition of Spitzer data

KELT-7 b has also been studied, in both transmission
and emission, by the Spitzer Space Telescope using the
each of the 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm channels of the InfraRed

Figure 6. Top: TESS observations of KELT-7 b presented
in this work. Left: detrended data and best-ﬁt model. Right:
residuals from ﬁtting. Bottom: Observed minus calculated
(O-C) mid-transit times for KELT-7 b. Transit mid time
measurements from this work are shown in gold (HST) and
blue (TESS), while the literature T0 value is in red. The
black line denotes the new ephemeris of this work with the
dashed lines showing the associated 1σ uncertainties and the
black plot data point indicating the updated T0. For com-
parison, the previous literature ephemeris and their 1σ un-
certainties are given in red. The inset ﬁgure shows a zoomed
plot which highlights the precision of the TESS mid time ﬁts.

Array Camera (IRAC). Combining data from multiple
instruments or observatories has become the standard
within the ﬁeld as a way of increasing the spectral cov-
erage, seeking to break the degeneracies that occur when
ﬁtting data over a narrow wavelength range (e.g. Sing
et al. 2016). However, such a procedure is fraught with
risk due to potential incompatibilities between datasets.
Firstly, it has been shown using diﬀerent orbital param-
eters (a/Rs and i) in the ﬁtting of the data can lead to
oﬀsets between the datasets (Yip et al. 2019). Secondly,
the choice of limb darkening coeﬃcients can cause verti-
cal shifts in the spectrum (Tsiaras et al. 2018). Thirdly,

10

stellar variability, activity or spots can also induce oﬀ-
sets in the recovered spectra (e.g. Bruno et al. 2020).
Finally,
imperfect correction of instrument systemat-
ics can alter the ﬁtted white light curve depth, again
generating shifts between datasets, making the derived
transit/eclipse depths incompatible (e.g. Stevenson et al.
2014b,a; Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014). Each of these ef-
fects can of course aﬀect HST data alone but, in this
case, the oﬀset would likely only lead to slight changes
in the retrieved temperature or radius. When combining
datasets, for instance HST WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC, oﬀ-
sets in one of these, or diﬀering oﬀsets in both, could lead
to wrongly recovered abundances. In transmission and
emission, Spitzer observations are sensitive to CH4 in
the 3.6µm band and CO or CO2 in the 4.5µm band while
WFC3 data cannot constrain these molecules. Thus the
detection, or non-detection, would be based entirely oﬀ
the two Spitzer bands relative to the WFC3 data. An
oﬀset in either one of these would instigate the incor-
rect recovery of the CH4, CO and CO2 abundances. In
emission, these Spitzer points have been used as evi-
dence for the presence of, or lack of, a thermal inver-
sion. Diﬀerences in the correction of systematics have
led to discrepant results (e.g. HD 209458 b: Knutson
et al. (2008); Diamond-Lowe et al. (2014)).

Here, we tentatively add the Spitzer data for KELT-
7 b, taken from the study by Garhart et al. (2020) of
36 hot Jupiters. For the ﬁtting of the Spitzer eclipses,
Garhart et al. (2020) froze the orbital parameters to
those from Bieryla et al. (2015), overcoming the ﬁrst
hurdle about combining datasets. The transit observa-
tions were also ﬁtted with ﬁxed orbital parameters and
limb darkening coeﬃcients from Claret (2000), again
showing consistency with our data. The latter two is-
sues, of stellar variability or activity and the detrend-
ing of instrument systematics, cannot be easily deter-
mined without an overlap in spectral coverage. There-
fore, we caution the reader that the compatibility of the
datasets cannot be guaranteed. Additionally, we cau-
tiously added the TESS data which was again ﬁtted with
same orbital parameters and limb darkening laws.

The best-ﬁt retrieved spectra, both with and with-
out the Spitzer data, is shown in Figure 7. Little dif-
ference is seen between the ﬁts, particularly in trans-
mission where the best-ﬁts are almost constantly within
1σ of each other. The recovered temperature pressure
proﬁles are also practically identical. While this may
suggest the data is compatible, it also shows that the
information content of adding Spitzer, in this case, is rel-
atively low. Therefore this begs the question of whether
risking data incompatibility is worthwhile when there
is little to gain. Figure 8 and 9 show posteriors from

the ﬁttings with and without Spitzer, again highlight-
ing the similarity between the ﬁts. In transmission the
only noticeable diﬀerence is in the recovered CO abun-
dance, which is not constrained in the case of HST alone
but the addition of Spitzer suggests an abundance of
log(CO) = −4.56+1.72
−4.69. The second change is in the
water abundance recovered in emission, with HST and
Spitzer converging to log(H2O) = −5.11+1.37
−4.03 while no
constraint can be made in the HST only case.

On the other hand, the addition of the TESS trans-
mission data drastically changes the solution, remov-
ing the detection of dissociated hydrogen, instead pre-
ferring FeH to explain the absorption at the shorter
wavelengths within the G141 grism due to the shallow
TESS transit depth. We also explored the retrieved at-
mospheric abundances in transmission without the H-
opacity, again ﬁnding that there is little diﬀerence when
adding Spitzer data as shown in Figure 10. In this case,
all data combinations readily agree on the abundances
of H2O, FeH and CO. However, diﬀerences in seen in
the evidence for TiO and VO, the presence of which
the addition TESS data of rules out for log(TiO,VO) >
-10, and in the recovered radius and terminator temper-
ature, with the TESS dataset preferring a lower radius
and higher temperature. We suggest it is imperative to,
at the very least, study multi-instrument data sets sep-
arately, as well as combined, when doing model ﬁtting,
as we have done in this study.

4.2. Future Characterisation

The most eﬀective solution to understanding the
source of the absorption seen in transmission between
1.1-1.3 µm would be to take more data, namely with
the G102 grism of WFC3 which covers 0.8-1.1 µm. As
there is also archival STIS transmission data for KELT-
7 b, with the G430L and G750L grisms, this would
provide continuous coverage from 0.3-1.6 µm, allowing
for better constraints on the abundances of these opti-
cal absorbers. We would also advocate for additional
eclipse observations with WFC3, with either grism, to
increase the spectral coverage and/or increase the sig-
nal to noise, which may allow for spectral features to be
uncovered.

Additionally, future space telescopes JWST (Greene
et al. 2016), Twinkle (Edwards et al. 2018) and Ariel
(Tinetti et al. 2018) will provide a far wider wavelength
range and these missions will deﬁnitively move the ex-
oplanet ﬁeld from an era of detection into one of char-
acterisation, allowing for the identiﬁcation of the molec-
ular species present and their chemical proﬁle, insights
into the atmospheric temperature proﬁle and the detec-
tion and characterisation of clouds. Ariel, the ESA M4

mission due for launch in 2028, will conduct a survey
of ∼1000 planets to answer the question: how chemi-
cally diverse are the atmospheres of exoplanets? KELT-
7 b has been identiﬁed as an excellent target for study
with Ariel (Edwards et al. 2019), through both trans-
mission and emission spectroscopy, and simulated error
bars from Mugnai et al. (2020) have been added to the
best-ﬁt spectra to showcase this. Figure 11 shows sim-
ulated Ariel and JWST observations and highlights the
wavelength coverage performed by those future missions.
Additionally ExoWebb (Edwards et al. 2020) has been
used to showcase the capability of JWST for studying
this planet.

5. CONCLUSION

We present spectroscopic transmission and emission
observations of KELT-7 b taken with Hubble WFC3.
While the transit spectra demonstrates strong absorp-
tion features indicative of H2O and H−, the emission
spectrum lacks features and can be ﬁtted with CIA
alone. We also explore adding data from Spitzer IRAC,
with the results being very similar in both transmission
and emission. Finally, we ﬁnd that adding TESS data
in our analysis strongly modiﬁes our results. As these
instruments do not provide spectral overlap, more data
is needed to fully understand the source of the optical
absorption seen in transmission. Further observations
with Hubble, or with the next generation of observato-
ries, will undoubtedly allow for an enhanced probing of
the atmosphere of this intriguing planet. The analysis of

12

archival Hubble data is an essential preparatory step in
enriching our comprehension of exoplanet atmospheres,
allowing us to begin to appreciate their true diversity
and understand the optimal observation strategy for
upcoming facilities.

TauREx3 employs Bayesian statistics as the cornerstone for the retrieval analysis (Waldmann et al. 2015a,b). Bayes’

theorem states that:

APPENDIX

P (θ | x, M) =

P (x | θ, M) P (θ, M)
P (x | M)

where P (θ, M) is the Bayesian prior, M is the forward model. P (θ | x, M) is the posterior probability of the model
parameters θ given the data, x assuming the forward model M. Bayesian analysis is implemented in TauREx3 via
nested sampling (NS).

TauREx3 includes the implementation of NS Bayesian statistics via Multinest (Feroz & Hobson 2008; Feroz et al.
2009a, 2013). NS employs Monte Carlo approach which constrains via ellipsoids encompassing the parameter space of
the highest likelihood. NS determines the Bayesian evidence which is given by:
