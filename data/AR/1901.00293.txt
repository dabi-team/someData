A holomorphic functional calculus for ﬁnite
families of commuting semigroups

Jean Esterle

January 3, 2019

Abstract

Let A be a commutative Banach algebra such that uA 6= {0} for u ∈
A \ {0} which possesses dense principal ideals. The purpose of the paper
is to give a general framework to deﬁne F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ) where
F belongs to a natural class of holomorphic functions deﬁned on suitable
open subsets of Ck containing the "Arveson spectrum" of (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ),
where ∆T1 , . . . , ∆Tk are the inﬁnitesimal generators of commuting one-
parameter semigroups of multipliers on A belonging to one of the following
classes

(1) The class of strongly continous semigroups T = (T (teia)t>0 such

that ∪t>0T (teia)A is dense in A, where a ∈ R.

(2) The class of semigroups T = (T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b holomorphic on an open
sector Sa,b such that T (ζ)A is dense in A for some, or equivalently for all
ζ ∈ Sa,b.

We use the notion of quasimultiplier, introduced in 1981 by the author
at the Long Beach Conference on Banach algebras: the generators of the
semigroups under consideration will be deﬁned as quasimultipliers on A,
and for ζ in the Arveson resolvent set σar(∆T ) the resolvent (∆T − ζI)−1
will be deﬁned as a regular quasimultiplier on A, i.e. a quasimultiplier
S on A such that supn≥1 λnkSnuk < +∞ for some λ > 0 and some u
generating a dense ideal of A and belonging to the intersection of the
domains of Sn, n ≥ 1.

The ﬁrst step consists in "normalizing" the Banach algebra A, i.e.
continuously embedding A in a Banach algebra B having the same quasi-
multiplier algebra as A but for which lim supt→0+ kT (teia)kM(B) < +∞
kT (ζ)k < +∞
if T belongs to the class (1), and for which lim sup ζ→0
ζ∈Sα,β

for all pairs (α, β) such that a < α < β < b if T belongs to the class
(2). Iterating this procedure this allows to consider (λj∆Tj + ζI)−1 as an
element of M(B) for ζ ∈ Resar(−λj∆Tj ), the "Arveson resolvent set " of
−λj∆Tj , and to use the standard integral ’resolvent formula’ even if the
given semigroups are not bounded near the origin.

A ﬁrst approach to the functional calculus involves the dual Ga,b of
an algebra of fast decreasing functions, described in Appendix 2. Let
a = (a1, . . . , ak), b = (b1, . . . , bk), with aj ≤ bj ≤ aj + π, and de-
note by Ma,b the set of families (α, β) = (α1, β1), . . . , (αk, βk) such that

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
αj = βj = aj if aj = bj and such that aj < αj ≤ βj < bj if aj < bj . Let
Uα,β denote the class of all functions f : ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζk) → f (ζ) continu-
ous on the product space Sα,β = Πj≤kSαj ,βj and converging to 0 at inﬁn-
ity such that the function σ → f (ζ1, . . . , ζj−1, η, ζj+1, . . . , ζk) is holomor-
phic on Sαj ,βj whenever αj < βj . Elements of the dual U ′
α,β admit a "rep-
resenting measure", and we describe in appendix 1 some certainly well-
known ways to implement the duality between Uα,β and U ′
α,β and extend
the action of elements of U ′
α,β to vector-valued analogs spaces Uα,β(X)
and their "bounded" counterparts Vα,β(X) via representing measures and
Cauchy and Fourier-Borel transforms. In appendix 2 we introduce a nat-
ural algebra of fast decreasing functions, which is the intersection for
(α, β) ∈ Ma,b and z ∈ Ck of all e−zUα,β, where ez(ζ) = ez1ζ1+...+zkζk .
The dual Ga,b of this algebra is an algebra with respect to convolution,
this dual space is the union for z ∈ Ck and (α, β) ∈ Ma,b of the dual
spaces (e−zUα,β)′, and elements of these dual spaces act on the vector-
valued spaces e−zUα,β(X). This action can also be implemented via rep-
resenting measures, Cauchy transforms and Fourier Borel transforms as
indicated in appendix 2. If λj Sαj ,βj is contained in the domain of def-
inition of Tj for j ≤ k, this allows to deﬁne the action of φ ∈ Ga,b on
T(λ) = (T1(λ1.), . . . , Tk(λk.) by using the formula

< T(λ), φ > u =< T1(λ1ζ1) . . . Tk(λkζk)u, φζ1,...,ζk > (u ∈ B),

where B denotes a normalization of the given commutative Banach
algebra A with respect to T = (T1, . . . , Tk), when φ ∈ (e−zUα,β)′ and
when supζ∈Sα,β

open sets stable under ﬁnite intersection and an algebra homomorphism
F → F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ) from ∪U ∈WT ,λ H (1)(U ) into the multiplier
algebra M(B) ⊂ QMr(A). This homomorphism extends in a natural

exists a sequence (Fn)n≥1 of invertible elements of H ∞(U ) such that
|F (ζ)| ≤ |Fn(ζ)| and limn→+∞ F (ζ)F −1
n (ζ) = 1 for ζ ∈ U. Every bounded
outer function on the open unit disc D is strongly outer, but the class of
strongly outer functions on Dk is smaller than the usual class of bounded
outer functions on Dk if k ≥ 2. We then deﬁne the Smirnov class S(U ) to
be the class of those holomorphic functions F on U such that F G ∈
H ∞(U ) for some strongly outer function G ∈ H ∞(U ). The bounded
algebra homomorphism F → F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ) from ∪U ∈WT ,λ
into QMr(B) = QMr(A) extends to a bounded homomorphism from
∪U ∈WT ,λ S(U ) into QM(B) = QM(A). If F : ζ → ζj is the j-th coordi-
nate projection, then of course F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ) = λj∆Tj .

1 Introduction

The author observed in [14] that if a Banach algebra A does not possess any
kx2 − xk ≥ 1/4. If x is quasinilpotent, and
nonzero idempotent then inf x∈A

kxk≥1/2

if kxk ≥ 1/2, then kxk > 1/4. Concerning (nonzero) strongly continuous semi-
groups T = (T (t))t>0 of bounded operators on a Banach space X, these elemen-
tary considerations lead to the following results, obtained in 1987 by Mokhtari
[24]

1. If lim supt→0+ kT (t) − T (2t)k < 1/4, then the generator of the semigroup

is bounded, and so lim sup kT (t) − T (2t)k = 0.

2. If the semigroup is quasinilpotent, then kT (t) − T (2t)k > 1/4 when t is

suﬃciently small.

If the semigroup is norm continuous, and if there exists a sequence (tn)n≥1
of positive real numbers such that limn→+∞ tn = 0 and kT (tn) − T (2tn)k < 1/4,
then the closed subalgebra AT of B(X) generated by the semigroup possesses
an exhaustive sequence of idempotents, i.e. there exists a sequence (Pn)n≥1 of
idempotents of AT such that for every compact set K ⊂
AT there exists nK > 0
satisfying χ(Pn) = 1 for χ ∈ K, n ≥ nK.

More sophisticated arguments allowed A. Mokhtari and the author to obtain

in 2002 in [18] more general results valid for every integer p ≥ 1.

These results led the author to consider in [15] the behavior of the distance

kT (s) − T (t)k for s > t near 0. The following results were obtained in [15]

1. If there exist for some δ > 0 two continuous functions r → t(r) and
r → s(r) on [0, δ], such that s(0) = 0 and such that 0 < t(r) < s(r)

and kT (t(r)) − T (s(r))k < (s(r) − t(r)) s(r)
t(r)

s(r)
s(r)−t(r)

t(r)
s(r)−t(r)

for r ∈ (0, δ], then

the generator of the semigroup is bounded, and so kT (t) − T (s)k → 0 as
0 < t < s, s → 0+.

2. If the semigroup is quasinilpotent, there exists δ > 0 such that kT (t) −

T (s)k > (s − t) s
t

for 0 < t < s ≤ δ.

3. If the semigroup is norm continuous, and if there exists two sequences of
positive real numbers such that 0 < tn < sn, limn→+∞ sn = 0, and such

that kT (tn) − T (sn)k < (sn − tn) s

of B(X) generated by the semigroup possesses an exhaustive sequence of

The quantities appearing in these statements are not mysterious: consider
the Hilbert space L2([0, 1], and for t > 0 deﬁne T0(t) : L2([0, 1] → L2([0, 1] by the
formula T0(t)(f )(x) = xtf (x) (0 < x ≤ 1). Then kT0(t) − T0(s)k = (s − t) s
.

This remark also shows that assertions (1) and (3) in these statements are sharp,
and examples show that assertion (2) is also sharp.

One can consider T (t) as deﬁned by the formula

T (x)dδt(x), where
δt denotes the Dirac measure at t. Heuristically, T (t) = et∆T , where ∆T de-
notes the generator of the semigroup, and since the Laplace transform of δt

e−zxdδt(x) = e−zt, it is natural to

write L(δt)(−∆T ) = T (t). More generally, if an entire function F has the form

F = L(µ), where µ is a measure supported by [a, b], with 0 < a < b < +∞, we
can set

and consider the behavior of the semigroup near 0 in this context.
I. Chalendar, J.R. Partington and the author used this point of view in [8].
Denote by Mc(0, +∞) the set of all measures µ supported by some interval
[a, b], where 0 < a < b < +∞. For the sake of simplicity we restrict attention to
statements analogous to assertion 2. The following result is proved in [8]
Theorem: Let µ ∈ Mc(0, +∞) be a nontrivial real measure such that

0 and let T = (T (t))t>0 be a quasinilpotent semigroup of bounded operators.Then

there exists δ > 0 such that kF (−s∆T )k > maxx≥0 |F (x)| for 0 < s ≤ δ.

When µ = δ1 − δ2 this gives assertion 3 of Mokhtari’s result, and when
µ = δ1 − δp+1 this gives assertion 3 of the extension of Mokhtari’s result given
in [18] (but several variables extensions of this functional calculus would be
needed in order to obtain extensions of the results of [15]).

This theory applies, for example, to quantities of the form kT (t) − 2T (2t) +

T (3t)k, or Bochner integrals k

R
holomorphic in a sector were obtained by I. Chalendar, J.R. Partington and the
author in [9].

More generally it would be interesting to obtain lower estimates as (λ1, . . . , λk) →

(0, . . . , 0) for quantities of the form F (−λ1∆T , . . . , −λk∆T ) when the generator
∆T of the semigroup is unbounded, and when F is an analytic function of several
complex variables deﬁned and satisfying natural growth conditions on a suitable
neighbourhood of σar(∆T ), where σar(∆T ) denotes the "Arveson spectrum" of
the inﬁnitesimal generator ∆T of T. The purpose of the present paper is to pave
the way to such a program by deﬁning more generally F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk )
when F belongs to a suitable class of holomorphic functions on some element of
a family WT1,...,Tk,λ of open sets, and where (T1, . . . , Tk) denotes a ﬁnite family
of commuting semigroups.

More precisely consider a = (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ Rk, b = (b1, . . . , bk) ∈ Rk) satis-
fying aj ≤ bj ≤ aj + π for j ≤ k, and consider a commutative Banach algebra
A such that uA is dense in A for some u ∈ A and such that uA 6= {0} for
u ∈ A \ {0}. This allows to consider the algebra QM(A) of all quasimultipliers
on A and the algebra QMr(A) of all regular quasimultipliers on A introduced
by the author in [14], see section 2, and the usual algebra M(A) of all multipli-
ers on A can be identiﬁed to the algebra of all quasimultipliers on A of domain
equal to the whole of A. We will be interested here in ﬁnite families (T1, . . . , Tk)
of commuting semigroups of multipliers on A satisfying the following conditions

• the semigroup Tj is strongly continuous on eiaj .(0, +∞), and ∪t>0Tj(eiaj t)A

is dense in A if aj = bj,

• the semigroup Tj is holomorphic on the open sector Saj ,bj := {z ∈ C \
{0} | aj < arg(z) < bj} and Tj(ζ)A is dense in A for some (or, equivalently,
for all) ζ ∈ Saj ,bj if aj < bj.

The ﬁrst step of the construction consists in obtaining a "normalization" AT
of the Banach algebra A with respect to a strongly continuous one-parameter
semigroup (T (t))t>0 of multipliers on A. The idea behind this normalization pro-
cess goes back to Feller [20], and we use for this the notion of "QM-homomorphism"
between commutative Banach algebras introduced in section 2, which seems
more appropriate than the related notion of "s-homomorphism" introduced by
the author in [14]. Set ωT = kT (t)k for t > 0. A slight improvement of a
result proved by P. Koosis and the author in section 6 of [13] shows that the
weighted convolution algebra L1(R+, ωT ) possesses dense principal ideals, which
allows to construct in section 3 a commutative Banach algebra AT ⊂ QMr(A)

5

which contains A as a dense subalgebra and has dense principal ideals such
that the injection ˜j : QM(A) → QM(AT ) associated to the norm-decreasing
inclusion map j : A → AT is onto and such that ˜j(M(A)) ⊂ M(AT ) for
which lim supt→0+ kT (t)kM(AT) < +∞. Set φT (f ) =
f (t)T (t)dt for f ∈
L1(R+, ωT ), where the Bochner integral is computed with respect to the strong
operator topology on M(A), and denote by IT the closed subalgebra of M(A)
generated by φT (L1(R+, ωT )). In section 5 we give an interpretation of the gener-
ator ∆T of the semigroup T as a quasimultiplier on IT , and we deﬁne the "Arve-
, where ˜χ denotes the unique
son spectrum" σar(∆T ) to be the set { ˜χ(∆T )}χ∈
extension to QM(IT ) of a character χ on IT , with the convention σar(∆T ) = ∅
if the "Arveson ideal" IT is radical. The quasimultiplier ∆T − λI is invertible
in QMr(IT ) and (∆T − λI)−1 ∈ M(AT ) ⊂ QMr(A) if λ ∈ C \ σar(∆T ), and
we observe in section 6 that we have, for ζ > lim supt→+∞

groups not necessarily bounded near the origin.

In section 4 we construct a more sophisticated normalization of the Banach
algebra A with respect to a semigroup T = (T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b which is holomorphic
on an open sector Sa,b, where a < b ≤ a + π. In this case the normalization AT
of A with respect to the semigroup T satisﬁes two more conditions

• T (ζ)uAT is dense in AT for ζ ∈ Sa,b if uA is dense in A,

• lim sup

ζ→0
α≤arg(ζ)≤β

kT (ζ)kM(AT ) < +∞ for a < α < β < b.

The generator of the holomorphic semigroup T is interpreted as in [7] as
a quasimultiplier on the closed subalgebra of A generated by the semigroup,
which is equal to the Arveson ideal IT0 where T0 denotes the restriction of T to
the half-line (0, ei a+b
2 .∞), and the resolvent ζ → (∆T − ζI)−1, which is deﬁned
and holomorphic outside a closed sector of the form z + S−ieia,ieib is studied in
section 7.

Consider again a = (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ Rk, b = (b1, . . . , bk) ∈ Rk) satisfying aj ≤
bj ≤ aj + π for j ≤ k and a ﬁnite family T = (T1, . . . , Tk) of commuting semi-
groups of multipliers on A satisfying the conditions given above. By iterating the
normalization process of A with respect to T1, . . . , Tk given in sections 3 and 4,
we obtain a "normalization" of A with respect to the family T, see deﬁnition 8.1,
which is a commutative Banach algebra B ⊂ QMr(A) for which the injection
j : A → B is norm-decreasing, has dense range and extends to a norm-decreasing
homomorphism from M(A) into M(B), for which the natural embedding ˜j :
QM(A) → QM(B) is onto, and for which lim supt→0+ kT (teiaj kM(B) < +∞ if
aj = bj, and for which lim sup

Denote by Ma,b the set of all pairs (α, β) ∈ Rk × Rk such that αj = βj = aj
if aj = bj and such that aj < αj ≤ βj < bj if aj < bj. Let Wa,b be the
algebra of continuous functions f on ∪(α,β)∈Ma,bSα,β := Πj≤kSαj ,βj such that
ez(ζ)f (ζ) → 0 as |ζ| → 0 in Πj≤kSαj ,βj for every z = (z1, . . . , zk) ∈ Ck and
every (α, β) ∈ Ma,b, and such that the maps ζ → f (ζ1, ζj−1, ζ, ζj+1, . . . ζk)
are holomorphic on Saj ,bj if aj < bj. For every element φ of the dual space
a,b there exists (α, β) ∈ Ma,b, z ∈ Ck and a measure ν of bounded

variation on Sα,β := Πj≤kSαj ,βj such that

< f, φ >=

and this formula allows to extend the action of φ to e−zVα,β(X) ⊃ e−zUα,β(X),

where X denotes a separable Banach space and where Uα,β(X) (resp. Vα,β(X))
denotes the algebra of continous functions f : Sα,β → X which converge to 0 as
ζ → ∞ (resp. bounded continuous functions f : Sα,β → X) such that the maps
ζ → f (ζ1, ζj−1, ζ, ζj+1, . . . , ζ) are holomorphic on Sαj ,βj when αj < βj.

Set Uα,β := Uα,β(C). We describe in appendix 1 some certainly well-known
ways to implement the action of U ′
α,β on Vα,β(X) when (α, β) ∈ Ma,b by us-
ing Cauchy transforms and Fourier-Borel transforms, and these formulae are
extended to the action of elements of (e−zUα,β)′ to spaces e−zVα,β(X) in ap-
pendix 2.

If φ ∈ (∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β)′, deﬁne the domain Dom(F B(φ)) of the Fourier-
Borel transform F B(φ) of φ to be the set of all z ∈ Ck such that φ ∈ (e−zUα,β)′,
and set F B(φ)(z) =< e−z, φ > for z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)). One can also deﬁne
in a natural way the Fourier-Borel transform of f ∈ e−zVα,β(X). Let λ ∈
∪(γ,δ)∈Ma−α,b−β Sγ,δ, and set T(λ)(ζ) = T (λ1ζ1, . . . , λkζk) for ζ ∈ Sα,β.

The convolution product of two elements of (e−zUα,β)′ may be deﬁned in a

natural way, and if λ, φ1, φ2 satisﬁes the conditions above we have

< T(λ), φ1 ∗ φ2 >=< T(λ), φ1 >< T(λ), φ2 >,

α,β and that U + ǫ ⊂ Resar(−λ∆T ) for some ǫ ∈ S

In section 9 of the paper we introduce a class U of "admissible open sets" U ,
with piecewise C1-boundary, of the form (z + S∗

where (α, β) ∈ Ma,b. These open sets U have the property that U + ǫ ⊂ U for

The results of appendix 3 allow when an open set U ⊂ Ck admissible with
respect to (α, β) ∈ Ma,b satisﬁes some more suitable admissibility conditions
with respect to T = (T1, . . . , Tk) and λ ∈ Sγ,δ for some (γ, δ) ∈ Ma−α,b−β to

Given T and λ ∈ ∪(α,β)∈Ma,b Sa−α,b−β, denote by WT,λ the family of all
open sets U ⊂ Ck satsisfying these admissibility conditions with respect T and
λ. Then WT,λ is stable under ﬁnite intersections, ∪U∈WT ,λ H (1)(U ) is stable
under products and we have

(F1F2)(−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ) = F1(−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk )F2(−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ).

This homomorphism extends in a natural way to a bounded algebra homo-
morphism from ∪U∈WT ,λH ∞(U ) into QMr(B) = QMr(A), and we have, if

the domain of deﬁnition of Tj.

A function F ∈ H ∞(U ) will be said to be strongly outer if there exists a
sequence (Fn)n≥1 of invertible elements of H (∞)(U ) such that |F (ζ)| ≤ |Fn(ζ)|
and limn→+∞ F (ζ)F −1
n (ζ) = 1 for ζ ∈ U. If U is admissible with respect to
some (α, β) ∈ Ma,b then there is a conformal map θ from Dk onto U and the
map F → F ◦ θ is a bijection from the set of strongly outer bounded functions
on U onto the set of strongly outer bounded functions on Dk. Every bounded
outer function on the open unit disc D is strongly outer, but the class of strongly
outer bounded functions on Dk is smaller than the usual class of bounded outer
functions on Dk if k ≥ 2. We then deﬁne the Smirnov class S(U ) to be the
class of those holomorphic functions F on U such that F G ∈ H ∞(U ) for some
strongly outer function G ∈ H ∞(U ). The bounded algebra homomorphism F →
F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ) from ∪U∈WT ,λ into QMr(B) = QMr(A) extends to
a bounded homomorphism from ∪U∈WT ,λ S(U ) into QM(B) = QM(A). If F :

2 Quasimultipliers on weakly cancellative com-
mutative Banach algebras with dense principal
ideals

We will say that a Banach algebra A is weakly cancellative if uA 6= {0} for
every u ∈ A \ {0}. In the whole paper we will consider weakly cancellative com-
mutative Banach algebras with dense principal ideals, i.e. weakly cancellative
commutative Banach algebras such that the set Ω(A) := {u ∈ A | [uA]− = A}
is not empty.

A quasimultiplier on such an algebra A 6= {0} is a closed operator S =
Su/v : DS → A, where u ∈ A, v ∈ Ω(A), where DS := {x ∈ A | ux ∈ vA},
and where Sx is the unique y ∈ A such that vy = ux for x ∈ DS. Let QM(A)
be the algebra of all quasimultipliers on A. A set U ⊂ QM(A) is said to be
pseudobounded if supS∈U kSuk < +∞ for some u ∈ Ω(A) ∩ (∩S∈U D(S)), and
a quasimultiplier S ∈ QM(A) is said to be regular if the family {λnSn}n≥1 is
pseudobounded for some λ > 0. The algebra of all regular quasimultipliers on
A will be denoted by QMr(A). A multiplier on A is a bounded linear operator
S on A such that S(uv) = (Su)v for u ∈ A, v ∈ A, and the multiplier algebra
M(A) of all multipliers on A, which is a closed subalgebra of B(A), is also the
algebra of all quasimultipliers on A such that DS = A, and M(A) ⊂ QMr(A).
Also if S = Su/v ∈ QM(A), w ∈ D(S), R ∈ M(A), then u(Rw) = R(v(Sw)) =
v(R(Sw)), so Rw ∈ D(S), and we have

R(Sw) = S(Rw).

(1)

If A is unital then Ω(A) = G(A), where G(A) denotes the group of invertible

elements of A, and QM(A) = M(A).

The following notion if slightly more ﬂexible than the notion of s-homomorphism

introduced by the author in [14].

Deﬁnition 2.1 : Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
with dense principal ideals, and let B be a weakly cancellative Banach algebra. A
homomorphism Φ : A → B is said to be a QM-homomorphism if the following
conditions are satisﬁed

(i) Φ is one-to-one, and Φ(A) is dense in B.
(ii) Φ(u)B ⊂ Φ(A) for some u ∈ Ω(A).

If the conditions of deﬁnition 2.1 are satisﬁed, we will say that Φ is a QM-
homomorphism with respect to u. Notice that Φ(u) ∈ Ω(B), and so the existence
of such an homomorphism implies that B is a weakly cancellative commutative
Banach algebra with dense principal ideals. Notice also that condition (ii) shows
that B may be identiﬁed to a subalgebra of QM(Φ(A)) ≈ QM(A).

Proposition 2.2 Let Φ : A → B be a homomorphism between weakly cancella-
tive commutative Banach algebras with dense principal ideals, and assume that
Φ is a QM-homomorphism with respect to some u0 ∈ Ω(A).

10

(i) There exists M > 0 such that kΦ−1(Φ(u0)v)k ≤ M kvk for v ∈ B.
(ii) Φ−1(Φ(u0)v) ∈ Ω(A) for v ∈ Ω(B).
(iii) Set ˜Φ(Su/v) = SΦ(u)/Φ(v) for Su/v ∈ QM(A). Then ˜Φ : QM(A) →
QM(B) is a pseudobounded isomorphism, and ˜Φ−1(Su/v) = SΦ−1(Φ(u0)u)/Φ−1(Φ(u0)v)
for Su/v ∈ QM(B).

Proof: (i) Set Ψ(v) = Φ−1(Φ(u0)v) for v ∈ B. If limn→+∞ vn = v ∈ B, and
if limn→+∞ ψ(vn) = w ∈ A, then Φ(u0)v = Φ(w), so that w = Ψ(v) and (i)
follows from the closed graph theorem.

(ii) Let v ∈ Ω(B), and let (wn)n≥1 be a sequence of elements of A such that
0 ∈ Ω(A), and

limn→+∞ vΦ(wn) = Φ(u0). Then limn→+∞ Φ−1(Φ(u0)v)wn = u2
so Φ−1(Φ(u0)v) ∈ Ω(A).

(iii) Let U ⊂ QM(A) be a pseudobounded set, and let w ∈ Ω(A)∩(∩S∈U D(S))
be such that supS∈U kSwk < +∞. Then Φ(w) ∈ Ω(B), and Φ(w) ∈ ∩S∈U D( ˜φ(S)).
Since supS∈U k ˜Φ(S)Φ(w)k ≤ kΦk supS∈U kSwk < +∞, this shows that ˜Φ :
QM(A) → QM(B) is pseudobounded.

Now set θ(Su/v) = SΦ−1(Φ(u0)u)/Φ−1(Φ(u0)v) = SΨ(u)/Ψ(v) for Su/v ∈ QM(B).
It follows from (ii) that θ : QM(B) → QM(A) is well-deﬁned. Let U ⊂ QM(B)
be pseudobounded, and let w ∈ Ω(B)∩(∩S∈U D(S)) be such that supS∈U kSwk <
+∞. We have, for S = Su/v ∈ U,

u(Su/vw) = vw, uΦ(u0)(Su/vwΦ(u0)) = vΦ(u0)wΦ(u0),

Φ−1(uΦ(u0))

Φ−1(Su/vwΦ(u0)

= Φ−1(vΦ(u0))Φ−1(wΦ(u0)).

So Φ−1(wφ(u0)) ∈ D(θ(S)), and θ(S)Φ−1(wΦ(u0)) = φ−1
. Since
(cid:1)
supS∈U k (SwΦ(u0)) k ≤ M supS∈U kSwk < +∞, this shows that θ : QM(B) →
QM(A) is pseudobounded. We have, for S = Su/v ∈ QM(A),

Su/vwΦ(u0)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:0)

(θ ◦ ˜Φ)(S) = SΦ−1(Φ(u)Φ(u0))/Φ−1(Φ(v)Φ(u0)) = Suu0/vu0 = Su/v = S.

We also have, for S = Su/v ∈ QM(A),

( ˜Φ ◦ θ)(Su/v) = SΦ(Φ−1(uΦ(u0))/Φ(Φ−1(vΦ(u0)) = SuΦ(u0)/vΦ(u0) = Su/v = S.

Hence ˜Φ = QM(A) → QM(B) is bijective, and ˜Φ−1 = θ : QM(B) →

QM(A) is pseudobounded. (cid:3)

The following result is a simpliﬁed version of theorem 7.11 of [14], which will

be used in the next two sections.

Proposition 2.3 Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
with dense principal ideals, and let U ⊂ QM(A) be a pesudobounded set stable
under products. Set L := {u ∈ ∩S∈U D(S) | supS∈U kSuk < +∞}, and set
kukL := supS∈U∪{I} kSuk for u ∈ L. Then (L, k.kL) is a Banach algebra, Ru ∈
L and kRukL ≤ kRkM(A)kukL for R ∈ M(A), u ∈ L, and if we denote by B
the closure of A in (M(L), k.kM(L)), then the following properties hold

11

(i) B is a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra, and the inclusion

map j : A → B is a QM-homomorphism with respect to w for w ∈ (A) ∩ L.

(ii) ˜j(M(A)) ⊂ M(B), and k˜j(R)kM(B) ≤ kM(A) for R ∈ M(A), where
˜j : QM(A) → QM(B) is the pseudobounded isomorphism associated to j in
proposition 2.2(iii).

(iii) S ∈ M(B), and kSkM(B) ≤ kSkM(L) ≤ 1 for every S ∈ U.

Proof: The fact that (L, k.kL) is a Banach space follows from a standard
argument given in the proof of theorem 7.11 of [14]. Clearly, L is an ideal of A,
and it follows from the deﬁnition of k.kL that kuk ≤ kukL for u ∈ L. We have,
for u ∈ L, v ∈ L,

kuvkL ≤ kukLkvk ≤ kukLkvkL,

and so (L, k.kL) is a Banach algebra. If R ∈ M(A), u ∈ L, then it follows

from (i) that Ru ∈ ∩S∈U D(S), and that we have

sup
S∈U∪{I}

kS(Ru)k = sup

S∈U∪{I}

kR(Su)k ≤ kRkM(A)kukL.

Hence Ru ∈ L, and kRukL ≤ kRkM(A)kukL.
Now denote by B the closure of A in (M(L), k.kM(L)), and let w ∈ Ω(A)∩L.
Since L ⊂ B, B is weakly cancellative, and B is commutative and has dense
principal ideals since j(A) is dense in B. Since wB ⊂ L ⊂ A, we see that the
inclusion map j : A → B is a QM-homomorphism with respect to w, which
proves (i).

Let R ∈ M(A), and denote by R1 the restriction of R to L. Then R1 ∈
M(L), and kR1kM(L) ≤ kRkM(A). Set R2u = R1u for u ∈ B. Then R2u ∈
B, and kR2ukM(B) ≤ kR1kM(L)kukM(L) ≤ kRkM(A)kkukM(L). Hence R2 ∈
M(B), and kR2kM(B) ≤ kRkM(A).

Now let S0 ∈ U. we have, for u ∈ L, since U is stable under products,

kS0ukL = sup
S∈U

kS0Suk ≤ sup
S∈U

kSuk = kukL,

and so S0u ∈ L, and kS0kM(L) ≤ 1. This implies that S0(B) ⊂ B, so that

S0 ∈ M(B), and kSkM(B) ≤ kS0kM(L) ≤ 1, which proves (iii). (cid:3)

We have the following very easy observation.

Proposition 2.4 : Let A0, A1 and A2 be weakly cancellative commutative Ba-
nach algebras, and assume that Φ0 : A0 → A1 is a QM-homomorphism with
respect to u0 ∈ Ω(A0) and that Φ1 : A1 → A2 is a QM-homomorphism with
respect to u1 ∈ Ω(A1). Then Φ1 ◦ Φ0 : A0 → A2 is a QM-homomorphism with
respect to Φ−1

0 (Φ0(u0)u1).

Proof: The homomorphism Φ1 ◦ Φ0 is one-to-one and has dense range, and
it follows from proposition 2.2 (ii) that Φ−1
0 (Φ0(u0)u1) ∈ Ω(A0). Let u ∈ A2,
let v ∈ A2 be such that Φ1(v) = Φ1(u1)u, and let w ∈ A0 be such that
Φ0(w) = Φ0(u0)v. Then (Φ1 ◦ Φ0)
u = (Φ1 ◦ Φ0)(u0)Φ1(u1)u =

0 (Φ0(u0)u1)

Φ−1

(cid:0)

12

(cid:1)

Φ1(Φ0(u0)v) = (Φ1 ◦ Φ0)(w) ⊂ (Φ1 ◦ Φ0)(A0), and so Φ1 ◦ Φ0 is a QM-
homomorphism with respect to Φ−1

0 (Φ0(u0)u1). (cid:3)

We will denote by

A the space of all characters on a commutative Banach
algebra A, equipped with the Gelfand topology. Recall that A is said to be
radical when

A = ∅.

Deﬁnition 2.5 : Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
A, S = Su/v ∈ QM(A), set ˜χ(S) = χ(u)
with dense principal ideals. For χ ∈

A, with the convention σA(S) = ∅
and for S ∈ QM(A), set σA(S) := { ˜χ(S)}χ∈
if A is radical.

Clearly, ˜χ is a character on QM(A) for χ ∈

A for S ∈ QM(A).

We will use the following result in the study of the resolvent of semigroups.

Proposition 2.6 Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
with dense principal ideals, and let S ∈ QM(A). If λ0 − S has an inverse
(λ0I − S)−1 in QM(A) which belongs to A for some λ0 ∈ C, where I denotes
the unit element of M(A), then σA(S) is closed, λI−S has an inverse (λI−S)−1
in QM(A) which belongs to A for every λ ∈ C \ σA(S), and the A-valued map
λ → (λI − S)−1 is holomorphic on C \ σA(S).

Proof: If A is unital, then QM(A) = A, and there is nothing to prove. So
A,

assume that A is not unital, and set ˜A := A ⊕ CI. Then
where χ0(a + λI) = λ for a ∈ A, λ ∈ C.

˜A = {χ0} ∪ { ˜χ| ˜A}χ∈

Set a = (λ0I − S)−1 ∈ A. Then χ(a) = ˜χ(a) =

b
λ0− ˜χ(S) , so that ˜χ(S) =
A. Since σA(a) ∪ {0} = σ ˜A is a compact subset of C, this

χ(a) for χ ∈

λ0 − 1
shows that σA(S) is closed. We have, for λ ∈ C,

b

λ − ˜χ(S)
λ0 − ˜χ(S)

(cid:26)

.

(cid:27)χ∈

A

So I + (λ − λ0)a is invertible in ˜A for λ ∈ C \ σA(S), and the map λ →
a(I + (λ− λ0)a)−1 ∈ A is holomorphic on C\ σA(S). We have, for λ ∈ C\ σA(S),

b

(λI − S)a(I + (λ − λ0)a)−1 = ((λ − λ0)I + (λ0 − S))a(I + (λ − λ0)a)−1

= (I + (λ − λ0)a)(I + (λ − λ0)a)−1 = I.

Hence λI − S has an inverse (λI − S)−1 ∈ A for λ ∈ C − σA(S), and the

map λ → (λI − S)−1 = a(I + (λ − λ0)a)−1 is holomorphic on C \ σA(S). (cid:3)

3 Normalization of a commutative Banach alge-
bra with respect to a strongly continuous semi-
group of multipliers

1

A semigroup T = (T (t))t>0 of multipliers on a commutative Banach algebra A
is said to be strongly continuous if the map t → T (t)u is continuous on (0, +∞)
for every u ∈ A. This implies that supα≤t≤β kT (t)k < +∞ for 0 < α ≤ β < +∞,
n . In
and so kT (t)k
the remainder of the section T = (T (t))t>0 will denote a strongly continuous
group of multipliers on a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra A
such that ∪t>0T (t)A is dense in A. Hence if u ∈ ∩t>0Ker(T (t)), then uv = 0
for every v ∈ ∪t>0T (t)A, so uA = {0} and u = 0.

t has a limit ρT as t → +∞, and ρT = limn→+∞ kT (n)k

Notice that in this situation if A has a unit element 1 then if we set ˜T (t) =
T (t).1 then ˜T := ( ˜T (t))t>0 is a norm-continuous semigroup of elements of A.
Since ∪t>0T (t)A is dense in A, T (t0).1 is invertible in A for some t0 > 0, and
so limt→0+ kT (t).1 − 1k = 0, which implies that the generator of ˜T is bounded.
So there exist R ∈ M(A) ≈ A such that T (t) = etR for t > 0 if A is unital.

Let ω be a positive measurable weight on (0, +∞). Recall that if ω(s + t) ≤
ω(R+) of all (classes of) measurable
ω(s)ω(t) for s > 0, t > 0, then the space L1
+∞
kf (t)|ω(t)dt < +∞, equipped with
functions on [0, +∞) satisfying kf kω :=

Denote by IT the closure of ΦT (L1

Dirac sequence, i.e. a sequence (fn) of nonnegative integrable functions on
R+ such that
fn(t)dt = 1 and such that fn(t) = 0 a.e. on (αn, +∞) with
limn→+∞ αn = 0. Since the semigroup T is strongly continuous on A, a standard
argument shows that limn→+∞ kΦT (fn ∗ δt)u − T (t)uk = 0 for every t > 0 and
every u ∈ A. This shows that if v ∈ Ω(IT ), and if w ∈ Ω(A), then vw ∈ Ω(A).
The following result is then a consequence of theorem 6.8 of [13] and of

ωλ(R+)) 6= ∅. It follows also from proposition 5.4 of [16] that

Proposition 3.2 Let T := (T (t))t>0 be a strongly continuous of multipliers on
a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra A with dense principal ideals
such that ∪t>0T (t)A is dense in A. Let LT := {u ∈ A | lim supt→0+ kT (t)uk <
+∞} ⊃ ∪t>0T (t)A, choose λ > log(ρT ), set kukλ := sups≥0e−λskT (s)uk for
u ∈ LT , with the convention T (0) = I, and set kRkλ,op := sup{kRukλ | u ∈
LT , kukλ ≤ 1} = kRkM(LT ) for R ∈ M(LT ). Denote by AT the closure of A in
(M(LT ), k.kλ,op).

Then (LT , k.kλ) is a Banach algebra, the norm topology on LT does not

depend on the choice of λ, and the following properties hold

(i) The inclusion map j : A → AT is a QM-homomorphism with respect
to w for every ω ∈ Ω(A) ∩ LT , the tautological map ˜j : Su/v → Su/v is a
pseudobounded isomorphism from QM(A) onto QM(AT ) and if w ∈ Ω(A)∩LT ,
then ˜j−1(S) = Suw/vw for S = Su/v ∈ QM(AT ).

(ii) ˜j(M(A)) ⊂ M(AT ), and kRkM(AT ) ≤ kRkM(A) for R ∈ M(A).
(iii) kT (t)kM(AT ≤ kT (t)kλ,op ≤ eλt for t > 0, and lim supt→0+ kT (t)u −

ukλ,op = 0 for every u ∈ AT .

Proof:

It follows from lemma 3.1 that the family U = {e−λtT (t)}t>0 is
pseudobounded for λ > log(ρT ). The fact that (LT , k.kλ) is a Banach algebra,
and assertions (i) and (ii) follow from proposition 2.2 and proposition 2.3 applied
to U , and an elementary argument given in the proof of theorem 7.1 of [16] shows
that there exists k > 0 and K > 0 such that kkukλ ≤ sup0≤t≤1 kT (t)uk ≤
Kkukλ for u ∈ LT , which shows that the norm topology on LT does not depend
on the choice of λ.

It follows also from proposition 2.3 applied to U that kT (t)kM(AT ≤ kT (t)kλ,op ≤

eλt for t > 0, and limt→0+ kT (t)u − ukλ,op = 0 for every u ∈ ∪t>0T (t)A.
Since ∪t>0T (t)AT is dense in AT , a standard density argument shows that
limt→0+ kT (t)u − ukλ,op = 0 for every u ∈ AT . (cid:3)

This suggests the following deﬁnition

Deﬁnition 3.3 Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
with dense principal ideals, let T = ((T (t))t>0 be a strongly continuous semi-
group of multipliers on A such that T (t)A is dense in A for t > 0. A normal-
ization B of A with respect to T is a subalgebra B of QM(A) which is a Banach
algebra with respect to a norm k.kB and satisﬁes the following conditions

(i) The inclusion map j : A → B is a QM-homomorphism, and kj(u)kB ≤

kukA for u ∈ A.

(ii) ˜j(R) ⊂ M(B), and k˜j(R)kM(B) ≤ kRkM(A) for R ∈ M(A), where
˜j : QM(A) → QM(B) is the pseudobounded isomorphism associated to j intro-
duced in proposition 2.2 (ii).

(iii) lim supt→0+ k˜j(T (t))kM(B) < +∞.

For example the algebra AT constructed in proposition 3.2 is a normalization
of the given Banach algebra A with respect to the semigroup T. Notice that if B
is a normalization of A with respect to T, the same density argument as above
shows that limt→0+ kT (t)u − ukB = 0 for every u ∈ B.

4 Normalization of a commutative Banach alge-
bra with respect to a holomorphic semigroup
of multipliers

For a < b ≤ a+ π, denote by Sa,b the open sector {z ∈ C\ {0} | a < arg(z) < b},
with the convention Sa,a = {reia | r ≥ 0}. In this section we consider again a
weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra A with dense principal ideals
and we consider a semigroup T = (T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b of multipliers on A such that
∪t∈Sa,bT (t)A is dense in A which is holomorphic on Sa,b, which implies that
T (ζ)A is dense in A for every ζ ∈ Sa,b. So T (ζ)u ∈ Ω(A) for every ζ ∈ Sa,b and
every u ∈ Ω(A). We state as a lemma the following easy observations.

Lemma 4.1 Let u ∈ M(A) such that lim sup ζ→0

We now use a construction proposed by I. Chalendar, J.R. Partington and
the author in proposition 3.6 of [7] to associate to construct a QM- homomor-
phism from A into a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra B such
that supt∈Sα,β

kT (t)k < +∞ for every α, β satisfying a < α ≤ β < b.

The following result is more general than proposition 3.6 of [7].

Proposition 4.2 Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
with dense principal ideals, and let T = ((T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b be a holomorphic semi-
group of multipliers on A such that T (ζ)A is dense in A for ζ ∈ Sa,b. Set
αn = a + b−a

For n ≥ 1 set Vn := {e−µnζe−i

and set W = ∪n≥1Wn, so that W is stable under products. Set Lµ := {u ∈
AT0 | supw∈W kwukµ0,op < +∞, and set kukµ = supw∈W ∪{I} kwukµ0,op for
u ∈ Lµ. Denote by by Aµ,T the closure of AT0 in M(Lµ).Then T (ζ)u ∈ Lµ for
ζ ∈ Sa,b, u ∈ AT0 , (Lµ, k.kµ) is a Banach algebra, the inclusion map j : A →
Aµ,T is a QM homomorphism with respect to T (ζ)w2 for w ∈ Ω(A), and we
have the following properties

(i) The tautological map ˜j : Su/v → Su/v is a pseudobounded isomorphism
from QM(A) onto QM(Aµ,T ) and if ζ ∈ Sa,b then ˜j−1(S) = ST (ζ)w2u/T (ζ)w2v
for S = Su/v ∈ QM(Aµ,T ), w ∈ Ω(A).

(ii) ˜j(M(A)) ⊂ M(Aµ,T ) and kRkM(Aµ,T ) ≤ kRkM(A) for R ∈ M(A).
(iii)kT (ζ)kM(Aµ,T ) ≤ kT (ζ)kM(Lµ) ≤ eµnRe(ζe−i a+b
(iv) If a < α < β < b, then we have, for v ∈ Aµ,T ,

ζ→0
ζ∈Sα,β

kT (ζ)v − vkM(Aµ,T ) ≤ lim sup
ζ→0
ζ∈Sα,β

kT (ζ)v − vkM(Lµ) = 0.

Proof: Since kT0(2−n)kop,µ0 ≤ e2−nµ0 , the existence of a sequence (µn)n≥1

satisfying the required conditions follows from the lemma.

Let t > 0, let n0 ≥ 2 be such that 2−n0+1 < t, and let v ∈ W. Since
1 ∈ Vn for n ≥ 1, we can assume that v = v1 . . . vn, where n ≥ n0 and where

17

vj ∈ Vj for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Then kT0(2−j)vj kop,µ0 ≤ e2−j(µ0+1) for j ≥ n0, and so
kT0(2−n0+1 − 2−n)vn0 . . . vnkop,µ0 ≤ e(2−n0 −2−n)(µ0+1). We obtain

kT0(2−n0+1)vn0 . . . vnkop,µ0
≤ kT0(2−n)kop,µ0kT ((2−n0+1 − 2−n))vn0 . . . vnkop,µ0

≤ e2−n0+1(µ0+1)−2−n

≤ e2−n0+1(µ0+1).

Set r = t−2−n0+1

n0

. It follows from lemma 4.1(i) that for every j ≤ n0 − 1

there exists kj > 0 such that supv∈Vj kT (r)vkop,µ0 ≤ kj. This gives

kT0(t)vkop,µ0 ≤ kT0(r)v1kop,µ0 . . . kT0(r)vn0−1kop,µ0 kT0(2−n0+1)vn0 . . . vnkop,µ0

≤ k1 . . . kn0−1e2−n0+1(µ0+1),

and so T0(t)AT0 ⊂ Lµ. Now let ζ ∈ Sa,b. Then ζ − tei a+b

2 ∈ Sa,b for some

t > 0, and so T (ζ)AT0 = T (ζ − tei (α+β)

2

)T0(t)AT0 ⊂ T (ζ − tei (α+β)

2

)Lµ ⊂ Lµ.

Since W is stable under products, the fact that Lµ is a Banach algebra follows
from proposition 2.3, which also implies (ii) and (iii). Let ζ0 ∈ Sa,b. Since (iv)
holds for u ∈ T (ζ0)Aµ,T , and since T (ζ0)Aµ,T ) is dense in (Aµ,T , k.kLµ) (iv)
follows from (iii) by a standard density argument.

Let ζ ∈ Sa,b, and let w ∈ Ω(A) ⊂ Ω(AT0 ). Since T (ζ/2)w ∈ Ω(A), and
since lim supt→0+ kT0(t)T (ζ)wk < +∞, it follows from proposition 2.3 that
the inclusion map j0 : A → AT0 is a QM-homomorphism with respect to
T (ζ/2)w. Since T (ζ/2)w ⊂ Mµ ∩ Ω(AT0 ), it follows also from proposition
2.3 that the inclusion map j1 : AT0 → Aµ,T is a QM-homomorphism with
respect to T (ζ/2)w, and it follows then from proposition 2.4 that the inclu-
sion map j = j1 ◦ j0 : A → Aµ,T is a QM homomorphism with respect
to T (ζ/2)wT (ζ/2)w = T (ζ)w2. It follows then from proposition 2.2 that the
tautological map ˜j : Su/v → Su/v is a pseudobounded homomorphism from
QM(A) onto QM(Aµ,T ) and that ˜j−1(Su/v) = ST (ζ)uw2/T (ζ)vw2 for S = Su/v ∈
QM(Aµ,T ). Since T (ζ)Aµ,T ⊂ T (ζ/2) [T (ζ/2)Aµ,T ] ⊂ T (ζ/2)AT0 ⊂ A, and
since T (ζ)vA contains T (ζ)vw2A which is dense in A for v ∈ Ω(Aµ,T ), we have
T (ζ)v ∈ Ω(A) for ζ ∈ Sa,b, v ∈ Ω(Aµ,T ), and so ˜j−1(S) = ST (ζ)uw2/T (ζ)vw2 for
S = Su/v ∈ QM(Aµ,T ). (cid:3)

We will use the following notion.

Deﬁnition 4.3 Let A be a weakly commutative Banach algebra with dense prin-
cipal ideals, and let T := (T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b be an analytic semigroup of multipliers on
A such that T (ζ)A is dense in A for ζ ∈ Sa,b. A normalization of the algebra A
with respect to the semigroup T is a subalgebra B of QM(A) which is a Banach
algebra with respect to a norm k.kB and satisﬁes the following conditions

(i) There exists u ∈ Ω(A) such that the inclusion map j : A → B is a QM-
homomorphism with respect to T (ζ)u for every ζ ∈ Sa,b, and kj(u)kB ≤ kukA
for u ∈ A.

18

(ii) ˜j(R) ⊂ M(B), and k˜j(R)kM(B) ≤ kRkM(A) for R ∈ M(A), where
˜j : QM(A) → QM(B) is the pseudobounded isomorphism associated to j intro-
duced in proposition 2.2 (ii).

(iii) lim sup t→0
ζ∈Sα,β

k˜j(T (t))kM(B) < +∞ for a < α < β < b.

If B is a normalization of A with respect to the holomorphic semigroup
T = (T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b , a standard density argument shows that if a < α < β < b
then lim sup ζ→0

kT (ζ)u − ukB = 0 for every u ∈ B

ζinSα,β

Notice that the algebra A0,T = Aµ0,T and its norm topology associated to
the norm k.kµ0,op discussed above do not depend on the choice of µ0. This is
no longer the case for the Banach algebra Aµ,T and its norm topology, which
may depend on the choice of the sequence µ. In order to get a more intrin-
sic renormalization one could consider the Fréchet algebra L := ∩n≥1{u ∈
kT (ζ)ukµ0,op < +∞}, then consider the closed subalgebra U
AT | sup ζ∈Sαn ,βn
kukµ0,op ≤1
of L generated by the semigroup and introduce an intrinsic normalization of AT
to be the closure of U in M(U) with respect to the Mackey-convergence asso-
ciated to a suitable notion of boundedness on subsets of M(U), but it seems
more convenient to adopt the point of view used in proposition 4.2.

5 Generator of a strongly continuous semigroup

of multipliers and Arveson spectrum

In this section we consider again a weakly cancellative commutative Banach
algebra A with dense principal ideals and a strongly continuous semigroup T =
(T (t))t>0 of multipliers on A such that ∪t>0T (t)A is dense in A. We set again
ωT (t) = kT (t)k for t > 0. Denote by MωT the space of all measures ν on (0, +∞)
+∞
ωT (t)d|ν|(t) < +∞, and for ν ∈ MωT deﬁne a ΦT : MωT →
such that

The Bochner integral is well-deﬁned since the semigroup is strongly contin-
uous, MωT is a Banach algebra with respect to convolution of measures on the
half-line, and we will identify again the space L1
ωT of (classes of) measurable
functions on [0, +∞) satisfying
|f (t)|kT (t)kdt < +∞ to the ideal of all
ν ∈ MωT which are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.
Denote by BT the closure of φT (Mω) in M(A), and denote again by IT the
closure of ΦT (L1
ωT ) in M(A), so that the "Arveson ideal" IT is a closed ideal
of BT.

The idea of considering the generator of a semigroup as a quasimultiplier on
some suitable Banach algebra goes back to [21] and [22] for groups of bounded

19

operators and, more generally, for groups of regular quasimultipliers. An ob-
vious such interpretation was given by I. Chalendar, J. R. Partington and the
author in [7] for analytic semigroups, and the author interpreted in section 8 of
[16] the generator of a semigroup of bounded operators which is weakly continu-
ous in the sense of Arveson [2] as a quasimultiplier on the corresponding Arveson
⊂ Ω(IT ) and uv ∈ Ω(A) for
ideal IT . Since in the present context ΦT
u ∈ Ω(IT ), v ∈ Ω(A), the map jT : Su/v → Suw/vw is a pseudobounded homo-
morphism from QM(IT ) into QM(A) for every w ∈ Ω(A), and the deﬁnition
of jT does not depend on the choice of w.

The generator ∆T,IT of T considered as a strongly continuous semigroup of

multipliers on IT has been deﬁned in [16], def. 8.1 by the formula

∆T,IT = S−ΦT (f ′

0)/ΦT (f0),
satisﬁes f0 = 0, f ′

where f0 ∈ C1([0, +∞)) ∩ Ω
and an easy veriﬁcation given in [16] shows that this deﬁnition does not

Proposition 5.2 Let T1 and T2 be two semigroups satisfying the conditions
of deﬁnition 5.1with respect to A. If T1(t)T2(t) = T2(t)T1(t) for t > 0, then
∆T1T2,A = ∆T1,A + ∆T2,A.

Proof: Let f1 and f2 be two functions on [0, +∞) satisfying the conditions
of deﬁnition 5.1 with respect to T1 and T2. Since ωT1T 2(t) ≤ ωT1 (t)ωT1 (t) for
t > 0, f1f2 satisﬁes the conditions of deﬁnition 5.1 with respect to T1T2, and it
follows from Leibnitz rule and Fubini’s theorem that we have

ΦT1T2 (f1f2) = ΦT1 (f1)ΦT2 (f2), ΦT1T2 ((f1f2)′) = ΦT1(f ′

6 The resolvent

c

We now wish to discuss the resolvent of the generator of a strongly continuous
semigroup T = (T (t))t>0 of multipliers on A, where A is a weakly cancellative
commutative Banach algebra with dense principal ideals, and where ∪t>0T (t)A
is dense in A. From now on we will write ∆T = ∆T,A and we will denote by
D∆T ,A the domain of ∆T considered as a quasimultiplier on A. The Arveson
ideal IT is as above the closed subalgebra of M(A) generated by ΦT(L1

The Arveson resolvent set is deﬁned by the formula Resar(∆T,IT ) = C \
σar(∆T,IT ), with the convention σar(∆T,IT ) = ∅ if IT is radical. The usual
"resolvent formula," interpreted in terms of quasimultipliers, shows that λI −
∆T,IT ∈ QM(IT ) is invertible in QM(IT ) and that its inverse (λI − ∆T,IT )−1
belongs to the Banach algebra IT,B ⊂ QMr(IT ) obtained by applying theorem
2.2 to IT with respect to the semigroup T, and that we have, for Re(λ) >

where the Bochner integral is computed with respect to the strong oper-
ator topology on M(IT,B). Also the IT,B-valued map λ → (λI − ∆T,IT )−1
is holomorphic on Resar(T, IT ). The details of the adaptation to the context
of quasimultipliers of this classical part of semigroup theory are given in [16],
proposition 10.2.

We now give a slightly more general version of this result, which applies in
particular to the case where B is the normalization AT of A with respect to the
semigroup T introduced in proposition 2.2.

In the following we will identify the algebras QM(A) and QM(B) using the
isomorphism ˜j intoduced in proposition 2.2 (iii) if B is a normalization of A
with respect to T. We set ΦT,B(ν)u =
T (t)udν(t) for u ∈ B, ν ∈ MωT ,B ,
where ωT,B(t) = kT (t)kM(B) for t > 0, and we denote by IT,B the closure of

Proposition 6.1 Let A be a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
with dense principal ideals, let T = ((T (t))t>0 be a strongly continuous semi-
group of multipliers on A such that T (t)A is dense in A for t > 0, and let B
be a normalization of A with respect to T. Set Resar(∆T ) = Resar(∆T,IT ) =
C \ σar(∆T,IT ).

The quasimultiplier λI − ∆T ∈ QM (A) admits an inverse (λI − ∆T )−1 ∈
IT,B ⊂ M(B) ⊂ QM r(A) for λ ∈ Resar(∆T ), and the map λ → (λI − ∆T )−1 is
an holomorphic map from Resar(∆T ) into IT,B. Moreover we have, for Re(λ) >

jT (∆T,IT ,B ) = ∆T,B. Identifying IT,B to a subset of QM(IT,B) as above in

(λI − ∆T)−1 ∈ M(B) ⊂ QM r(A). Notice that since ∪t>0T (t)A is dense in

7 The generator of a holomorphic semigroup and

its resolvent

Let a < b ≤ a + π. In this section we consider a holomorphic semigroup T =
(T (ζ))ζ∈Sa,b of multipliers on a weakly cancellative commutative Banach algebra
A having dense principal ideals such that T (ζ)A is dense in A for some, or,
equivalently, for every ζ ∈ Sa,b.

Denote by IT the closed span of {T (ζ)}ζ∈Sa,b, which is equal to the closed
span of {Tζ(t)}t>0 for ζ ∈ Sa,b. For ζ ∈ Sa,b, set Tζ = (T (tζ))t>0, let ΦTζ :

26

Sa,b

→ M(A) be the homomorphism deﬁned by (2). Set ωT (ζ) = kT (ζ)k for
MωTζ
ζ ∈ Sa,b, denote by MωT (Sa,b) the space of all measures µ on Sa,b such that
ωT (ζ)d|µ|(ζ) < +∞, which is a Banach algebra with respect to
kµkωT :=
convolution. The convolution algebra L1
ωT (Sa,b) is deﬁned in a similar way and
will be identiﬁed to the closed ideal of MωT consisting of measures which are
absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Deﬁne ΦT : MωT →
IT ⊂ M(A) by the formula

R

ΦT (µ) =

T (ζ)dµ(ζ),

ZSa,b

which is well-deﬁned since the map ζ → T (ζ) is continuous with respect to

the norm topology on M(A) and since IT is separable.

Let ζ ∈ Sa,b. Since the semigroup Tζ is continuous with respect to the norm
topology on M(A), a standard argument shows that we have, for every Dirac
sequence (fn)n≥1,

ωT (Sa,b)) and the closure of ΦTζ (L1

and so T (sζ) ∈ ITζ for every s > 0, which implies that ITζ = IT , and a similar
argument shows that IT is the closure in (M(A), k.kM(A)) of ΦT (MωT (Sa,b)), as
well as the closure of ΦT (L1
and the notation IT is consistent with the notation used to denote the Arve-
son ideal associated to a strongly continuous semigroup of multipliers on the
half-line.

ωTζ

The following interpretation of the generator of a holomorphic semigroup
as a quasimultiplier follows the interpretation given in [7] in the case where
A = IT .

Proposition 7.1 Set

∆T,A := ST ′(ζ0)u0/T (ζ0)u0 ∈ QM(A),

where ζ0 ∈ Sa,b, u0 ∈ Ω(A).
Then this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of ζ0 and u0, and we have,

for ζ ∈ Sa,b,

∆Tζ ,A = ζ∆T,A,

(11)

where the generator ∆Tζ ,A of the semigroup Tζ is the quasimultiplier on A

introduced in deﬁnition 4.1.

Moreover If T1 = (T1(ζ))ζ∈Sa,b and T2 = (T2(ζ))ζ∈Sa,b are two holomorphic
semigroups of multipliers on A such that T1(ζ)A and T2(ζ)A are dense in A
and such that T1(ζ)T2(ζ) = T2(ζ)T1(ζ) for ζ ∈ Sα,β, then we have

∆T1T2,A = ∆T1,A + ∆T2,A.

27

Proof: We have, for ζ ∈ Sa,b,

T ′(ζ0)T (ζ) = T ′(ζ0 + ζ) = T ′(ζ)T (ζ0),

and so the deﬁnition of ∆T,A does not depend on the choice of ζ0, and an
easy argument given in the comments following deﬁnition 4.1 shows that this
deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of u0 ∈ Ω(A) either.

Now let ζ0 ∈ Sa,b, and le f ∈ C1([0, +∞))∩Ω(L1

In the remaining of the section we will denote by B a normalization of A
with respect to the semigroup T, see deﬁnition 4.3. Since QM(A) is isomorphic
to QM(B), we can consider the generator ∆T,A as a quasimultiplier on B, and
it follows immediately from deﬁnition 7.1 that this quasimultiplier on B is the
generator of the semigroup T considered as a semigroup of multipliers on B.
From now on we will thus set ∆T = ∆T,A = ∆T,B. Applying corollary 7.2 to T

(a) (B, k.kB) is a Banach algebra with respect to a norm k.kB satisfying
kukB ≤ kukA for u ∈ A, and there exists a family (w1, . . . , wk) of elements
of Ω(A) such that the inclusion map j : A → B is a QM-homomorphism
with respect to T1(ζ1) . . . Tk(ζk)w1 . . . wk for every family (ζ1, . . . , ζk) of complex
numbers such that ζj ∈ Saj ,bj if aj < bj and such that ζj = 0, if aj = bj.

(b) ˜j(M(A)) ⊂ M(B)), and k˜j(R)kM(B) ≤ kRkM(A) for every R ∈ M(A),
where ˜j : QM(A) → QM(B) is the pseudobounded isomorphism associated to
j in proposition 2.2 (ii).
(c) lim sup ζ→0
ζ∈Sγ,δ

kT (ζ)kM(B) < +∞ for aj < γ < δ < bj if aj < bj, and

lim supt→0+ kT (teiaj )kM(B) < +∞ if aj = bj.

It follows from proposition 3.2 and proposition 4.2 that there exists a nor-
malization B1 of A with respect to T1. Also if Bm is a normalization of A with
respect to (T1, . . . , Tm) and if Bm+1 is a normalization of Bm with respect to
Tm+1, it follows from proposition 2.4 and deﬁnitions 3.3 and 4.3 that Bm+1 is
a normalization of A with respect to (T1, . . . , Tm+1). It is thus immediate to
construct a normalization of A with respect to T by a ﬁnite induction. Notice
that if B is a normalization of A with respect to T, then B is a normalization
of A with respect to Tσ := (T (tσ))t>0 for every σ ∈ ∪(α,β)∈Ma,bSα,β.

30

Since ∪t>0T (teiaj )B is dense in B, when aj = bj, and since T (ζ)A is dense in
A for ζ ∈ Saj ,bj if aj < bj, it follows from condition (c) of deﬁnition 10.1 that the
map ζ → T (ζ)u1 . . . uk is continuous on Sα,β for (α, β) ∈ Ma,b, u1, . . . , uk ∈ B.
Since u1 . . . uk ∈ Ω(B) for u1, . . . , uk ∈ Ω(B), it follows again from condition (c)
of deﬁnition 10.1 that the map ζ → T (ζ)u is continuous on Sα,β for (α, β) ∈ Ma,b
for every u ∈ B. Let (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and assume that aj < bj. Since the semi-
group Tj is holomorphic on Saj ,bj the map η → T (ζ1, ζ2, . . . , ζj−1, η, ζj+1, ζk)u
is holomorphic on Sαj ,βj for every (ζ1, . . . , ζj−1, ζj+1, ζk) ∈ Π1≤s≤k

Sαs,βs.

s6=j

Notice that if u ∈ B, where B is a normalization of A with respect to T, then
the closed subspace BT,u spanned by the set {T (ζ)u | ζ ∈ Sa,b} is separable,
and so the function ζ → T (ζ)u takes its values in a closed separable subspace
of B.

With the convention Tj(0) = I for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, we see that if (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and
if λ ∈ ∪(γ,δ)∈Ma−α,b−β Sγ,δ then T(λ) : ζ → T (λζ) = (T1(λ1ζ1), . . . , Tk(λkζk)) is
well-deﬁned for ζ ∈ Sα,β.

Proposition 8.2 Let (α, β) ∈ Ma,b. For λ ∈ ∪(γ,δ)∈Ma−α,b−β Sγ,δ, denote by
N (T, λ, α, β) the set of all z ∈ Ck such that

lim

|etzj eiω

|kTj(tλj eiω)k = 0 for αj ≤ ω ≤ βj, 1 ≤ j ≤ k.

Then z ∈ N (T, λ, α, β) if and only if lim supt→+∞ |etzj eiαj |kTj(tλjeiαj )k <

Recall that Fα,β = (∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β)′ = ∪z∈Ck (e−zUα,β)′. If φ ∈ Fα,β, then
Dom(F B(φ)) is the set of all z ∈ Ck such that φ ∈ (e−zUα,β)′. In the following
deﬁnition the action of φ ∈ Fα,β on an element f of e−zVα,β(B) taking values in

If φ1 ∈ Fα(1),β(1), and if φ1 ∈ Fα(2),β(2), where (α(1), β(1)) ∈ Ma,b, (α(2), β(2)) ∈

Dom(φ1) 6= ∅ and N (T, λ, α(2), β(2)) ∩ Dom(φ2) 6= ∅ does not seem to imply
that N (T, λ, inf(α(1), α(2)), sup(β(1), β(2))) ∩ Dom(φ1 ∗ φ2) 6= ∅, which prevents

(cid:1)

Conditions (i) and (ii) mean that U is admissible with respect to (α, β) in the
sense of deﬁnition 12.1 and that some, hence all elements z ∈ Ck with respect to
which U satisﬁes condition (ii) of deﬁnition 12.1 belong to N0(T, α, β, λ). Hence
Uj is a open half-plane if αj = βj, and the geometric considerations about ∂Uj
made in section 12 when αj < βj apply.

For α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Rk, β = (β1, . . . , βk) ∈ Rk, we will use as in appendix

3 the obvious conventions

inf(α, β) = (inf(α1, β1), . . . , inf(αk, βk)), sup(α, β) = (sup(α1, β1), . . . , sup(αk, βk)).

Proposition 9.2 If U (1) is admissible with respect to (T, λ, α(1), β(1)) and if
U (2) is admissible with respect to (T, λ, α(2), β(2)), then U (1) ∩ U (2) is admissible
with respect to (T, λ, inf(α(1), α(2)), sup(β(1), β(2))).

Proof: Set α(3) = inf(α(1), α(2)), β(3) = sup(β(1), β(2)), and set U (3) = U (1) ∩

∩

a−α(1) ,b−β(1) Sγ,δ

∪(γ,δ)∈M

U (2). Then
so it makes sense to check whether U (1) ∩ U (2) is admissible with respect to
h
(T, λ, α(3), β(3)). The fact that U (3) satisﬁes (i) and (ii) follows from proposition
12.2, and the fact that U (3) satisﬁes (iii) is obvious. (cid:3)

versely assume that λ ∈ Sa−α,b−β for some (α, β) ∈ Ma,b. If aj = bj then
aj = αj = βj = bj, and so λj is a nonnegative real number. In this situation
set α′
j = aj, γj = δj = 0. If aj < bj, then aj < αj ≤ βj < bj, and
aj − αj ≤ arg(λj ) ≤ bj − βj if λj 6= 0. In this situation set α′

Corollary 9.3 For λ ∈ ∪(α,β)∈Ma,b Sa−α,b−β = ∪α,β∈Ma,b
∪(γ,δ)∈Ma−α,b−β Sγ,δ
denote by Nλ the set of all (α, β) ∈ Ma,b such that λ ∈ ∪(γ,δ)∈Ma−α,b−β Sγ,δ, and
(cid:1)
denote by WT,λ the set of all open sets U ⊂ Ck which are admissible with respect
to (T, λ, α, β) for some (α, β) ∈ Nλ.

(cid:0)

Then WT,λ is stable under ﬁnite intersections, and ∪U∈WT ,λH (1)(U ) is stable

,

under products.

Proof: The ﬁrst assertion follows from the proposition and the second as-
sertion follows from the fact that the restriction of F ∈ H (1)(U ) is bounded
on U + ǫ if U is admissible with respect to (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and if ǫ ∈ S∗
α,β, see
corollary 12.4. (cid:3)

A set E ⊂ ∪U∈WT ,λ H (1)(U ) will be said to be bounded if there exists
U ∈ WT,λ such that E ⊂ H (1)(U ) and such that supF ∈E kF kH(1)(U) < +∞,
and bounded subsets of ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ) are deﬁned in a similar way. A homo-
morphism φ : ∪U∈WT ,λH (1)(U ) → M(B) will be said to be bounded if φ(E) is

38

bounded for every bounded subset E of ∪U∈WT ,λH (1)(U ), and a homomorphism
φ : ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ) → QMr(B) = QMr(A) will be said to be bounded if φ(E)
is pseudobounded for every bounded subset E of ∪U∈WT ,λH ∞(U ).

Similarly let S(U ) be the Smirnov class on U ∈ WT,λ introduced in deﬁnition
12.6. A set E ⊂ ∪U∈WT ,λS(U ) will be said to be bounded if there exists U ∈
WT,λ such that E ⊂ S(U ) and such that supF ∈E kF GkH∞(U) < +∞ for some
strongly outer function G ∈ H ∞(U ), and a homomorphism φ : ∪U∈WT ,λS(U ) →
QM(B) = QM(A) will be said to be bounded if φ(E) is pseudobounded for
every bounded subset E of ∪U∈WT ,λS(U ).

Let U = Πj≤kUj ∈ WT,λ, and let (α, β) ∈ Nλ such that U is admissible with
respect to (T, λ, α, β). Let ∂Uj be oriented from e− π

The deﬁnition of RF does not depend on the choice of U, and if we set F (−λ1T1, . . . , −λkTk) =

Now consider again U ∈ WT,λ, and let F ∈ H ∞(U ). Let G0 ∈ H (1)(U ) be

Let U ′ ∈ WT,λ, and let G ∈ H (1)(U ′). We have

and so RF G(−λ∆T ) = (F G)(−λ∆T ), which shows that the deﬁnition of RF
does not depend on the choice of U. The map F → RF is clearly linear. Now let
F1 ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ), let F2 ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λH ∞(U ), and let G ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ H (1)(U )

RF1F2G2(−λ∆T ) = (F1F2G2)(−λ∆T ) = (F1G)(−λ∆T )(F2G)(−λ∆T )

Now let E be a bounded family of elements of ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ). There exists
U ∈ WT,λ and M > 0 such that F ∈ H (∞)(U ) and kF kH∞(U) ≤ M for every

family {F G}F ∈E is bounded in H (1)(U ), and it follows from (i) that there exists
u ∈ Ω(B) such that supF ∈E k(F G)(−λ∆T )ukB < +∞.

We obtain

sup
F ∈E

kRF G(−λ∆T )ukB = sup
F ∈E

k(F G)(−λ∆T )ukB < +∞,

and so the family {RF }F ∈E is pseudobounded in QM(B) = QM(A) since
G(−λ∆T )u ∈ Ω(B). Since the family {λ−nF n}n≥1 is bounded in H ∞(U ) for
F ∈ H ∞(U ), λ > (1+kF kH∞(U))−1, this shows that RF ∈ QMr(B) = QMr(A)
for F ∈ ∪U∈F H ∞(U ), and that the map F → RF is a bounded algebra homo-
morphism from ∪U∈F H ∞(U ) into QMr(B) = QMr(A), which concludes the
proof of (ii).

(iii) Let (α, β) ∈ Nλ, let φ ∈ Fα,β, assume that N0(T, λ, α, β)∩Dom(F B(φ)) 6=
∅, and let z ∈ N0(T, λ, α, β) ∩ Dom(F B(φ)). Then z + S∗
α,β is admissible with
respect to (T, λ, α, β). As in the proof of (ii) we can construct φ1 ∈ Fα,β having
the following properties

• z ∈ N0(T, λ, α, β) ∩ Dom(F B(φ1)),

• G := F B(φ1) ∈ H (1)(z + S∗

Let ǫ ∈ S∗

α,β be such that z+ǫ+S∗

α,β is admissible with respect to (T, λ, α, β).
It follows from assertions (v) and (vi) of theorem 8.6 and from (i) and (ii) that
we have

< T(λ), φ > F B(φ1)(−λ∆T ) =< Tλ), φ >< T(λ), φ1 >=< T(λ), φ ∗ φ1 >

and so < T(λ), φ >= F B(φ)(−λ∆T ) since F B(φ1)(−λ∆T )(B) is dense in B.
Now let ν ∈ C such that νλj ∈ ∪(γj ,δj )∈Maj ,bj

Sγj ,δj , and let νj = (νj,1, . . . , νj,k)

be the k-tuple deﬁned by the conditions νj,s = 0 if s 6= j, νj,j = ν. There exists
(γj, δj) ∈ Nλj such that ν ∈ Sγj ,δj , and there exists (α, β) ∈ Nλ such that
αj = γj and βj = δj. Set F (ζ) = e−νζj for ζ ∈ Ck, and set < f, φ >= f (νj) for
f ∈ ∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β. Then Dom(F B(φ)) = Ck, and we have, for ζ ∈ Ck,

F B(φ)(ζ) =< e−ζ, φ >= e−νj ζ = e−νζj ,

and so F = F B(φ). Let z ∈ N0(T, λ, α, β) = N0(T, λ, α, β) ∩ Dom(F B(φ)).
Let δνj be the Dirac measure at νj. Since e−zδνj is a representing measure for
φe−z we have

F (−λ∆T ) =< T(λ), φ >= Tj(νλj ),

which concludes the proof of (iii).
(iv) Let (α, β) ∈ Nλ, let φ ∈ Fα,β, and assume that N (T, λ, α, β)∩Dom(F B(φ)) 6=

∅. Set e−ǫT = (e−ǫ1T1, . . . , e−ǫk Tk). Then N (T, λ, α, β) ⊂ N0(e−ǫT, λ, α, β) for
ǫ ∈ S∗

(v) Let U ∈ Wt,λ, let F ∈ H ∞(U ) be strongly outer, and let (Fn)n≥1 be a
sequence of invertible elements of H ∞(U ) satisfying the conditions of deﬁnition
12.6 with respect to F. It follows from (ii) that there exists G ∈ H (1)(U )∩H ∞(U )
such that G(−λ∆T )(B) is dense in B. Let (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and z ∈ N0(T, λ, α, β)

kF (−λ∆T )F −1

n (−λ∆T )G2(−λ∆T ) − G2(−λ∆T )kM(B) = 0.

Let u ∈ Ω(B). Then G(−λ∆T )u ∈ Dom(F (−λ∆T )) ∩ Ω(B). Set un =

F −1

n (−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T )u ∈ B. We have

G(−λ∆T )2u2 = lim

n→+∞

F (−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T )uun.

Since G(−λ∆)2u2 ∈ Ω(B), this shows that F (−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T )u ∈ Ω(B), which
proves (v).

(vi) Let U ∈ WT,λ, let F ∈ S(U ), let G0 ∈ H ∞(U ) be a strongly outer
function such that F G0 ∈ H ∞(U ), and let u ∈ Dom(G0(−λ∆T )) such that
G0(−λ∆T )u ∈ Ω(B). Let v ∈ Ω(B) ∩ Dom(F G0(−λ∆T )). There exists a unique
RF ∈ QM(B) = QM(A) satisfying the equation

(F G0)(−λ∆T )uv = RF G0(−λ∆T )uv,

and we have

(F G0)(−λ∆T ) = RF G0(−λ∆T ),

so that RF = F (−λ∆T ) if F ∈ H ∞(U ).
Let G ∈ ∪V ∈WT ,λH ∞(V ) such that F G ∈ H ∞(W ) for some W ∈ WT,λ, and

let w ∈ Ω(B) ∩ Dom(G(−λ∆T )). We have

((F G)(−λ∆T )vw)G0(−λ∆T )u = (F G0)(−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T )uvw

= RF G0(−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T )uvw = (RF G(−λ∆T )vw)G0(−λ∆T )u.

Since vw (G0(−λ∆T )u) ∈ Ω(B), this shows that (F G)(−λ∆T ) = RF G(−λ∆T ).

So if we set F (−λ∆T ) = RF , we obtain F (−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T ) = (F G)(−λ∆T )
for every F ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λS(U ) and for every G ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ) such that
F G ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ). The map F → F (−λ∆T ) is clearly linear. Now let F1 ∈
∪U∈WT ,λS(U ), F2 ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ S(U ), and let G1 ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U ) and G2 ∈
∪U∈WT ,λH ∞(U ) be strongly outer functions such that F1G1 ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λ H ∞(U )
and F2G2 ∈ ∪U∈WT ,λH ∞(U ). We have

(F1F2)(−λ∆T )G1(−λ∆T )G2(−λ∆T ) = (F1F2G1G2)(−λ∆T )

= (F1G1)(−λ∆T )(F2G2)(−λ∆T ) = F1(−λ∆T )F2(−λ∆T )G1(−λ∆T )G2(−λ∆T ),

and so (F1F2)(−λ∆T ) = F1(−λ∆T )F2(−λ∆T ) since Dom(G1(−λ∆T )) ∩
Ω(B) 6= ∅ and Dom(G2(−λ∆T )) ∩ Ω(B) 6= ∅, and the map F → F (−λ∆T ) is an
algebra homomorphism from ∪U∈WT ,λ S(U ) into QM(B) = QM(A).

Now let E be a bounded family of elements of ∪U∈WT ,λ S(U ). There ex-
ists U ∈ WT,λ and a strongly outer function G ∈ H ∞(U ) such that F G ∈

46

H ∞(U ) for every F ∈ E and such that supF ∈E kF GkH∞(U) < +∞. So the fam-
ily {(F G)(−λ∆T )}F ∈E is a pseudobounded family of elements of QMr(B) =
QMr(A), and there exists u ∈ Ω(B) ∩ (∩F ∈E Dom((F G)(−λ∆T ))) such that
supF ∈E k(F G)(−λ∆T )ukB < +∞. Let v ∈ Dom(G(−λ∆T )) ∩ Ω(B), and set
w = G(−λ∆T )uv. Then w ∈ Ω(B) ∩ (∩F ∈E Dom(F (−λ∆T )) and

kF (−λ∆T )wkB = sup
F ∈E

k(F (−λ∆T )G(−λ∆T )uvkB

k(F G)(−λ∆T )ukBkvkB < +∞,

and so the family {F (−λ∆T }F ∈E is pseudobounded in QM(B) = QM(A), and
the map F → F (−λ∆T ) is a bounded algebra homomorphism from ∪U∈WT ,λS(U )
into QMB) = QM(A), which concludes the proof of (vi).

Now assume that A is not radical, let χ ∈

A, and let ˜χ be the unique

character on QM(A) such that ˜χ(u) = χ(u) for every u ∈ A.

Let F ∈ H (1)(U ), where U ∈ WT,λ, let (α, β) be the element of Ma,b asso-
b
ciated to U, and let ǫ ∈ S∗
α,β be such that U + ǫ is admissible with respect to
(T, λ, α, β). Since Bochner integrals commute with linear functionals, we have

˜χ (F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk ))

F (ζ1, . . . , ζk)(λ1 ˜χ(∆T1 )+ζ1I)−1 . . . (λ1 ˜χ(∆Tk )+ζkI)−1dζ1 . . . dζk.

Since U +ǫ is admissible with respect to (T, λ, α, β), (−λ1 ˜χ(∆T1 ), . . . , −λk ˜χ(∆Tk )) ∈

U + ǫ, and it follows from theorem 12.5 that we have

˜χ (F (−λ1∆T1 , . . . , −λk∆Tk )) = F (−λ1 ˜χ(∆T1 ), . . . , −λk ˜χ(∆Tk )).

Now let F ∈ H ∞(U ), where U ∈ WT,λ, and let G ∈ H (1)(U ) such that

G(−λ∆T )(B) is dense in B. Then ˜χ(G(−λ∆T )) 6= 0, and we have

˜χ(F (−λ∆T )) =

˜χ((F G)(−λ∆T ))
˜χ(G(−λ∆T ))

=

(F G)(−λ ˜χ(∆T ))
G(−λ ˜χ(∆T ))

= F (−λ ˜χ(∆T )).

Finally let F ∈ S(U ), where U ∈ WT,λ, and let G ∈ H ∞(U ) be a strongly
outer function such that F G ∈ H ∞(U ). It follows from (v) that G(−λ∆T )u ∈
Ω(B) for some u ∈ B, and so ˜χ(G(−λ∆T )) 6= 0. The same argument as above
shows then that ˜χ(F (−λ∆T )) = F (−λ ˜χ(∆T )), which concludes the proof of
(vi).

(vii) Set F (ζ1, . . . , ζk) = −ζj, choose ν0 > ν1 > limt→+∞

, and
set again vν0 (t) = te−ν0t. It follows from proposition 12.8(ii) that F ∈ S(U ) for
every U ∈ WT,λ, and it follows from proposition 5.5(i) that we have

(i) For f ∈ Vα,β(X), λ ∈ Sα,β, set fλ(ζ) = f (ζ + λ). Then fλ ∈ Vα,β(X) for
f ∈ Vα,β(X), fλ ∈ Uα,β(X) and the map λ → fλ belongs to Uα,β(Uα,β(X)) for
f ∈ Uα,β(X). Moreover if we set, for φ ∈ U ′

α,β,

fφ(λ) =< fλ, φ >,

then fφ ∈ Vα,β(X) for f ∈ Vα,β(X), and fφ ∈ Uα,β(X) for f ∈ Uα,β(X).
(ii) For φ1 ∈ U ′

α,β, φ2 ∈ U ′

α,β, set

< f, φ1 ∗ φ2 >=< fφ1, φ2 > (f ∈ Uα,β).

Then φ1 ∗ φ2 ∈ U ′

α,β, ν1 ∗ ν2 is a representing measure for φ1 ∗ φ2 if ν1 is a
representing measure for φ1 and if ν2 is a representing measure for φ2, and we
have

< f, φ1 ∗ φ2 >=< fφ1, φ2 > (f ∈ Vα,β(X)),

F B(φ1 ∗ φ2) = F B(φ1)F B(φ2).

Proof: These results follow from standard easy veriﬁcations which are left
to the reader. We will just prove the last formula. Let φ1 ∈ U ′
α,β.

We have, for z = (z1, . . . , zk) ∈ S
α,β, λ = (λ1, . . . , λk) ∈ Sα,β, ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζk) ∈
Sα,β,

α,β, φ2 ∈ U ′

(e−z)λ(ζ) = e−z1(λ1+ζ1)...−zk(λk+ζk) = e−z(λ)e−z(ζ),

and so (e−z)λ = e−z(λ)e−z, (e−z)φ1 (λ) =< (e−z)λ, φ1 >= e−z(λ)F B(φ1)(z),

(e−z)φ1 = F B(φ1)(z)e−z, and

F B(φ1∗φ2)(z) =< (e−z)φ1 , φ2 >= F B(φ1)(z) < e−z, φ2 >= F B(φ1)(z)F B(φ2)(z).

(cid:3)

For η ∈ Sα,β, denote by δη the Dirac measure at η. We identify δη to the
linear functional f → f (η) on Uα,β. With the above notations, we have, for
f ∈ Vα,β(X), φ ∈ U ′

α,β,

fδη = fη, < f, φ ∗ δη >=< fη, φ > .

If f ∈ Uα,β(X), we have lim ǫ→0

Now let f ∈ Vα,β(X), let φ ∈ U ′

In the following we will denote by ˜∂Sα,β = Π1≤j≤k∂Sαj ,βj the distinguished
boundary of Sα,β, where ∂Sαj ,βj = (eiαj .∞, 0] ∪ [0, eiβj .∞) is oriented from
eiαj .∞ towards eiβj .∞.

The following standard computations allow to compute in some cases <

Formula (26) follows from this equality applied to e−ǫf. Taking the limit as

dominated convergence theorem. (cid:3)

The following result is indeed standard, but we give a proof for the conve-

nience of the reader.

Proposition 10.7 The linear span of the set Eα,β := {f = e−σ : σ ∈ Πj≤k(0, e−i
is dense in Uα,β, and the Fourier-Borel transform is one-to-one on U ′

α,β.

Proof: Set J1 = {j ∈ {1, . . . , k} | αj = βj}, set J2 := {j ∈ {1, . . . , k} | αj <
βj}, denote by U1 the space of continuous functions on S1 = Πj∈J1 Sαj ,βj vanish-
ing at inﬁnity, set S2 := Πj∈J2 Sαj ,βj , and denote by U2 the space of continuous
functions on S2 vanishing at inﬁnity which satisfy the same analyticity condi-
tion as in deﬁnition 10.1 with respect to S2. Also set E1 := {f = e−σ : σ ∈
Πj∈J1 (0, e−i

.∞)}, and set E2 := {f = e−σ : σ ∈ Πj∈J2 (0, e−i
Assume that J1 6= ∅. Then the complex algebra span(E1) is self-adjoint and
separates the point on U1, and it follows from the Stone-Weierstrass theorem
applied to the one-point compactiﬁcation of S1 that span(E1) ⊕ C.1 is dense in
U1 ⊕ C.1, which implies that span(E1) is dense in U1 since U1 is the kernel of a
character on U1 ⊕ C.1.

Now assume that J2 6= ∅, set S∗

αj ,βj which vanishes on (0, e−i

2, and deﬁne
2 = Πj∈J2 S− π
the Cauchy transform and the Fourier-Borel transform of φ as in deﬁnition 10.3.
Assume that < f, φ >= 0 for φ ∈ E2. If j ∈ J2, then g = 0 for every holomorphic
function g on S∗
.∞). An immediate ﬁnite
induction shows then that F B(φ) = 0 since F B(φ) is holomorphic on S∗
2 . It
follows then from proposition 10.4 that C(φ) = 0, and it follows from (23) and
(26) that < f, φ >= 0 for every f ∈ U2. Hence φ = 0, which shows that span(E2)
is dense in U2. This shows that span(Eα,β) is dense in Uα,β if J1 = ∅ or if J2 = ∅.
Now assume that J1 6= ∅ and J2 6= ∅, and denote by E ⊂ Uα,β the set
of products f = gh, where g ∈ U1 and h ∈ U2. The space U1 = C0(S1) is a
closed subsbace of codimension one of C(S1 ∪ {∞}). Since the space C(K) has a
Schauder basis for every compact space K, [3],[30], the space U1 has a Schauder
basis.
Identifying the dual space of U1 to the space of measures of bounded
variation on S1, this means that there exists a sequence (gn)n≥1 of elements of
U1 and a sequence (νn)n≥1 of measures of bounded variation on S
such that
we have

every g ∈ U1. It follows then from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem that there
exists M > 0 such that kPmkB(U1) ≤ M for m ≥ 1, a standard property of
Schauder bases in Banach spaces.

Now let φ ∈ U ′

α,β such that < f, φ >= 0 for f ∈ E, let ν be a repe-
senting measure for φ, and let f ∈ Uα,β. The function fζ = η → f (η, ζ)
belongs to U1 for ζ ∈ S2, and a routine veriﬁcation shows that the function
f (ζ, η)dνn(η) belongs to U2 for n ≥ 1. Since
hn : ζ →
the evaluation map g → g(η) is continuous on U1 for η ∈ S1, we obtain, for
η ∈ S1, ζ ∈ S2,

This shows that span(E) is dense in Uα,β. Since span(E1) is dense in U1 and
span(E2) is dense in U2, span(Eα,β) is dense in span(E), and so span(Eα,β) is
dense in Uα,β.

Now let φ ∈ U ′

α,β. If F B(φ) = 0, then < f, φ >= 0 for every f ∈ Eα,β, and
so φ = 0 since span(Eα,β) is dense in Uα,β, which shows that the Fourier-Borel
transform is one-to-one on Uα,β.

and so ez”f ∈ Uα,β since Uα,β is a closed subalgebra of Vα,β. This concludes the
proof of (iv) when m = 2. The general case follows by an immediate induction,
since sup(ζ, z(l)) = sup1≤j≤l z(j)) for every ζ ∈ sup1≤j≤l−1 z(j) if (z1), . . . , z(l))

Notice that assertions (ii) and (iii) of the proposition do not extend to the
case where βj = αj + π for some j ≤ k. It suﬃces to consider the case where
αj = − π
2 . Set λj(t) = (λs,t)1≤s≤k, where λs,t = 0 for s 6= j and
λj,t = t. Then the map f → e−λj (t)f is an isometry on Uα,β for every t ≥ 0 and
∩t>0uλj (t)Uα,β = {0} since the zero function is the only bounded holomorphic
function f on the right-hand open half-plane satisfying limr→+∞ |etrf (r)| = 0
for every t > 0.

Let iζ : f → f be the inclusion map from ∩z∈Ce−zUα,β into e−ζUα,β. Since
iζ has dense range, the map i∗
is a one-to-one map from
ζ : φ → φ|∩z∈Ce−z Uα,β
(e−ζUα,β)′ into ∩z∈Ce−zUα,β)′, which allows to identify (e−ζUα,β)′ to a subset
of (∩z∈Ce−zUα,β)′, so that we have

Deﬁnition 11.3 Set Fα,β := (∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β)′. Let φ ∈ Fα,β, and let X be a
separable Banach space.

(i) The domain of the Fourier-Borel transform of φ is deﬁned by the formula

Dom(F B(φ)) := {z ∈ Ck | φ ∈ (e−zUα,β)′}.

(ii) For z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)) the functional φe−z ∈ U ′

α,β is deﬁned by the

formula

< f, φe−z >=< e−zf, φ > (f ∈ Uα,β),

62

and < g, φ > is deﬁned for g ∈ e−zVα,β(X) by the formula

< g, φ >=< ezg, φe−z > .

(iii) The Fourier-Borel transform of φ is deﬁned for z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)) by

the formula

F B(φ)(z) =< e−z, φ > .

(iv) The z-Cauchy transform of φ is deﬁned on Ck\−S

∗
α,β for z ∈ Dom(F B(φ))

by the formula

Cz(φ) = C(φe−z).

(v) If z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)) a measure ν of bounded variation on Sα,β is said to

be a z-representing measure for φ if ν is a representing measure for φe−z.

Since the map ζ → e−ζ is holomorphic on S∗

α,β, the map z → e−z is a
holomorphic map from λ + S∗
α,β into e−λUα,β for every λ ∈ Dom(F B(φ)),
and so F B(φ) is holomorphic on the interior of Dom(F B(φ)) for φ ∈ Fα,β.
Also the z-Cauchy transform Cz(φ) is holomorphic on C \ Sα,β for every z ∈
∗
Dom(F B(φ)). Notice also that if φ ∈ U ′
α,β ⊂ Dom(F B(φ)) and
so the function F B(φ) deﬁned above is an extension to Dom(F B(φ)) of the
Fourier-Borel transform already introduced in deﬁnition 10.3 on S

α,β, then S

Now let z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)), z′ ∈ Dom(F B(φ)) and assume that g ∈ e−zVα,β(X)∩

e−z′Vα,β(X). Let z′′ ∈ sup(z, z′) ⊂ Dom(F B(φ)). Then g ∈ e−z”Vα,β(X). Let
ν be a z-representative measure for φ. We have, for h ∈ ∩λ∈Ck e−λUα,β, since
e−z = e−z′′ ez′′−z.

Since ez−z′′ν is a measure of bounded variation on Sα,β, ez−z”ν is a z′′-
representative measure for φ. Similarly if ν′ is a z′-representative measure for φ
then ez′−z′′ ν′ is a z′′-representative measure for φ, and we have

Then fλ ∈ ∩zk∈Ce−zUα,β, and we can compute < fλ, φ > . The map λ → fλ
is a continuous map from Sα,β into the Fréchet algebra ∩z∈Ce−zUα,β which is
holomorphic on Sα,β. We obtain

Lemma 11.5 Let φ ∈ Fα,β. Then the function fφ : λ →< fλ, φ > belongs
to ∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β for every f in ∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β, and the linear map f → fφ is
continuous on ∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β.

Proof: Let f ∈ ∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β, let z0 ∈ Dom(F B(φ)), let ν be a z0-representing

Proposition 11.6 For φ1 ∈ Fα,β, φ2 ∈ Fα,β, deﬁne the convolution product
φ1 ∗ φ2 ∈ Fα,β by the formula

< f, φ1 ∗ φ2 >=< fφ1, φ2 > (f ∈ ∩z∈Ck e−zUα,β).

Then sup(z1, z2) ⊂ Dom(F B(φ1∗φ2)) for z1 ∈ Dom(F B(φ1)), z2 ∈ Dom(F B(φ2)),

and we have, for z ∈ sup(z1, z2),

kφ1 ∗ φ2k(e−zUα,β )′ ≤ kφ1k(e−z1 Uα,β )′ kφ2k(e−z2 Uα,β )′.

More generally Dom(F B(φ1)) ∩ Dom(F B(φ2)) ⊂ Dom(F B(φ1 ∗ φ2)), and
if z ∈ Dom(F B(φ1)) ∩ Dom(F B(φ2)) then (φ1 ∗ φ2)e−z = (φ1e−z) ∗ (φ2e−z),
so that ν1 ∗ ν2 is a z-representative measure for φ1 ∗ φ2 if ν1 is a z-representing
measure for φ1 and if ν2 is a z-representing measure for ν2, and we have

F B(φ1 ∗ φ2)(z) = F B(φ1)(z)F B(φ2)(z)

(z ∈ Dom(F B(φ1)) ∩ Dom(F B(φ2)).

Proof: Let z1 ∈ Dom(F B(φ1)), let z2 ∈ Dom(F B(φ2)), and let z ∈ sup(z1, z2).

It follows from (32) that we have, for f ∈ ∩z∈Ck ezUα,β,

| < f, φ1 ∗ φ2 > | = | < fφ1, φ2 > | ≤ kez2fφ1k∞kφ2k(e−z2 Uα,β )′
≤ kezf k∞kφ1k(e−z1 Uα,β )′kφ2k(e−z2 Uα,β )′ .

Hence φ1∗φ2 ∈ Fα,β, sup(z1, z2) ⊂ Dom(F B(φ1∗φ2)), and kφ1∗φ2k(e−z Uα,β)′

≤ kφ1k(e−z1 Uα,β)′ kφ2k(e−z2 Uα,β )′ for z ∈ sup(z1, z2).

Let z ∈ Dom(F B(φ1)) ∩ F B(φ2)). Then z ∈ sup(z, z) ⊂ Dom(F B(φ1 ∗ φ2)).
Let ν1 be a z-representing measure for φ1 and let ν2 be a z-representing

measure for φ2. We have, for f ∈ ∩s∈Ck e−sUα,β,

< f, φ1 ∗ φ2 >=< fφ1, φ2 >=

and so ν1 ∗ ν2 is a representing measure for (φ1 ∗ φ2)e−z, which means that
ν1 ∗ ν2 is a z-representative measure for φ1 ∗ φ2. Since ν1 is a representative
measure for φ1e−z, and since φ2 is a representative measure for φ2e−z, it follows
from proposition 10.5 (ii) that (φ1 ∗ φ2)e−z = (φ1e−z) ∗ (φ2e−z).

It follows also from proposition 10.5(ii) that

F B(φ1 ∗ φ2)(z) = F B((φ1 ∗ φ2)e−z)(1) = F B((φ1e−z) ∗ (φ2e−z))(1)

Let X be a separable Banach space. For η ∈ Sα,β, z ∈ Ck, f ∈ e−zVα,β(X),

The following consequence of proposition 10.6 allow to compute in some cases
α,β, f ∈ Vα,β(X), z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)) by using the z-Cauchy

Proposition 11.8 Assume that αj < βj < αj + π for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, let φ ∈ Fα,β,
let z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)), and let X be a separable Banach space.

α′,β′. Since
Let z ∈ Dom(F B(φ)). Then F B(φ)(z + ζ) = 0 for every ζ ∈ S
Dom(F B(φ)) is connected, we have F B(φ) = 0. Hence φ = 0, since the Fourier-
Borel transform is one-to-one on Fα,β. (cid:3)

We can thus identify Fα,β to a subset of Fα′,β′ for α′

A standard application of the Mittag-Leﬄer theorem of projective limits of
complete metric spaces, see for example [13], theorem 2.14, shows that we have
the following result, where as before Ma,b = {(α, β) ∈ Rk × Rk | aj < αj ≤ βj <
bj if aj < bj, αj = βj = aj if aj = bj}.
Proposition 11.11 Let a = (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ Rk, b = (b1, . . . , bk) ∈ Rk such that
aj ≤ bj ≤ aj +π for j ≤ k. Then ∩(α′,β′)∈Ma,b,λ∈Ck e−λUα′,β′ is dense in e−zUα,β
for every z ∈ C and every (α, β) ∈ Ma,b.
Let (a, b) ∈ Rk ×Rk be as above, and denote by ∆a,b the set of all triples (α, β, z)
where (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and z ∈ Ck. Denote by (cid:22) the product partial order on Rk
associated to the usual order on R. If (α, β, z) ∈ ∆a,b, (α′, β′, z′) ∈ ∆a,b, set

so that sup1≤l≤m z(j), is the set introduced in deﬁnition 9.1(ii) when α =

(inf 1≤l≤m α(l))j < (sup1≤l≤m β(l))j for 1 ≤ j ≤ k.

It follows from the proposition that we can identify the dual of the projective
limit ∩(α,β,z)∈∆a,be−zUα,β to the inductive limit ∪(α,β,z)∈∆a,b(e−zUα,β)′. This
suggests the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 11.12 Let a = (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ Rk, b = (b1, . . . , bk) ∈ Rk such that
aj ≤ bj ≤ aj + π for j ≤ k. Set

Ga,b = (∩(α,β,z)∈∆a,be−zUα,β)′ = ∪(α,β,z)∈∆a,b(e−zUα,β)′.
For φ ∈ Ga,b, set dom(φ) = {(α, β, z) ∈ ∆α,β | φ ∈ (e−zUα,β)′}.

We thus see that the inductive limit Ga,b = ∪(α,β)∈Ma,b Fα,β is an associative
unital pseudo-Banach algebra with respect to the convolution product intro-
duced above on the spaces Fα,β. A subset V of Ga,b is bounded if and only
if there exists (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and z ∈ Ck such that V is a bounded subset of
(e−zUα,β)′.

The proof of the following proposition is left to the reader.

Proposition 11.13 Let φ ∈ Ga,b, and let (α, β, z) ∈ dom(φ). Then (α′, β′, z′) ∈
dom(φ) if (α, β, z) (cid:22) (α′, β′, z′). In particular if (φj )1≤j≤m is a ﬁnite family
of elements of Ga,b, and if (α(j), β(j), z(j)) ∈ dom(φj ) for 1 ≤ j ≤ m, then
sup1≤j≤m(α(j), β(j), z(j)) ⊂ ∩1≤j≤mdom(φj ) ⊂ dom(φ1 ∗ . . . ∗ φm).

For α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Rk, β = (β1, . . . , βk) ∈ Rk, we will use the obvious

conventions

inf(α, β) = (inf(α1, β1), . . . , inf(αk, βk)), sup(α, β) = (sup(α1, β1), . . . , sup(αk, βk)).

Clearly, (inf(α(1), α(2)), sup(β(1), β(2)) ∈ Ma,b if (α(1), β(1)) ∈ Ma,b and (α(2), β(2)) ∈
Ma,b.

Proposition 12.2 If U (1) is admissible with respect to (α(1), β(1)) ∈ Ma,b and

If αj = βj for j ≤ k, then every (α, β) admissible open set U is a product of
open half-planes and the space H (1)(U ) is the usual Hardy space H 1(U ). The
standard conformal mappings of the open unit disc D onto half planes induce
an isometry from the Hardy space H 1(Dk) onto H 1(U ). It follows then from
standard results about H 1(Dk), see theorems 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 of [28], that F
admits a.e. a nontangential limit F ∗ on ˜∂U, and that limǫ→0 |

Recall that the Smirnov class N +(P +) on the right-hand open half-plane P +

It follows from the positivity of the Poisson kernel on the real line that
|F (ζ)| ≤ |Fn(ζ)| and that limn→+∞ Fnζ) = F (ζ) for Re(ζ) > 0. Also the non-
tangential limit F ∗
n (iy)| =
sup(e−n, |F ∗(iy)|) a.e., which shows that supζ∈P + |Fn(ζ)| = supζ∈P + |F (ζ)|
when n is suﬃciently large. Hence limn→+∞ F (ζ)F −1

n (iy) of F at iy exists a.e. on the imaginary axis and |F ∗

n (ζ) = 1 for ζ ∈ P +.

This suggests the following notion;

Deﬁnition 12.6 Let U ⊂ Ck be a connected open set. A holomorphic function
F ∈ H ∞(U ) is said to be strongly outer on U if there exists a sequence (Fn)n≥1
of invertible elements of H ∞(U ) satisfying the following conditions

(i) |F (ζ)| ≤ |Fn(ζ)| (ζ ∈ U, n ≥ 1),
(ii) limn→+∞ F (ζ)F −1

n (ζ) = 1 (ζ ∈ U ).

76

The Smirnov class S(U ) consists of those holomorphic functions F on U

such that F G ∈ H ∞(U ) for some strongly outer function G ∈ H ∞(U ).

It follows from (ii) that F (ζ) 6= 0 for every ζ ∈ U if F is strongly outer on U,
and F|V is strongly outer on V if V ⊂ U. Similarly if F ∈ S(U ) then F|V ∈ S(V ).
Also it follows immediately from the deﬁnition that the set of bounded strongly
outer functions on U is stable under products, and that if there is a conformal
mapping θ from an open set V ⊂ Ck onto U then F ∈ H ∞(U ) is strongly outer
on U if and only if F ◦ θ is strongly outer on V , and if G is holomorphic on U
then G ∈ S(U ) if and only F ◦ θ ∈ S(V ).

Now let (α, β) ∈ Ma,b and let U = Πj≤kUj be an admissible open set with
respect to (α, β). Then each set Uj is conformally equivalent to the open unit
disc D, and so there exists a conformal mapping θ from Dk onto U , and the
study of the class of bounded strongly outer functions on U (resp. the Smirnov
class on U ) reduces to the study of the class bounded strongly outer functions
(resp. the Smirnov class) on Dk.

Let F ∈ H ∞(Dk) be strongly outer, and let (Fn)n≥1 be a sequence of invert-
ible elements of H ∞(Dk) satisfying the conditions of deﬁnition 12.6 with respect
to F. Denote by T = ∂D the unit circle. Then H ∞(Dk) can be identiﬁed to a w∗-
closed subspace of L∞(Tk) with respect to the w∗-topology σ(L1(Tk), L∞(Tk)).
Let L ∈ H ∞(Dk) be a w∗-cluster point of the sequence (F F −1
n )n≥1. Since
the map G → G(ζ) is w∗-continuous on H ∞(Dk) for ζ ∈ Dk, L = 1, and
so F H ∞(Dk) is w∗-dense in H ∞. When k = 1, this implies as well-known that
F is outer, and the argument used for the half-plane shows that, conversely,
every bounded outer function on D is strongly outer, and so S(D) = N +(D).

Recall that a function G ∈ H ∞(Dk) is said to be outer if log(|G(0, . . . , 0)|) =

Tk log|G∗(eit1 , . . . , eitk )|dt1 . . . dtk, where G∗(eit1 , . . . , eitk ) denotes a.e. the
(2π)k
nontangential limit of G at (eit1 , . . . , eitk ), see [28], deﬁnition 4.4.3, and G
is outer if and only if almost every slice function Gω is outer on D, where
Gω(ζ) = G(ωζ) for ω ∈ Tk, ζ ∈ D, see [28], lemma 4.4.4. If follows from deﬁ-
nition 12.6 that every slice function Fω is strongly outer on D if F ∈ H ∞(Dk)
is strongly outer on Dk, and so every strongly outer bounded function on Dk is
outer. It follows from an example from [28] that the converse is false if k ≥ 2.

Proposition 12.7 Let k ≥ 2, and set F (ζ1, . . . , ζk) = e

function ˜f : (ζ1, ζ2) → f ( ζ1+ζ2

and so F is outer on Dk.
Now set ω = (1, . . . , 1). Then Fω = f is not outer on D, and so F is not

strongly outer on Dk. (cid:3)

The fact that some bounded outer functions on D are not strongly outer is
not surprising: The Poisson intergal of a real valued integrable function on Tk
is the real part of some holomorphic function on Dk if an only if its Fourier
coeﬃcients vanish on Zk \ (Z+)k ∪ (Z−)k, see [28], theorem 2.4.1, and so the
construction of the sequence (Fn)n≥1 satisfying the conditions of deﬁnition 12.6
with respect to a bounded outer function F on Dk breaks down when k ≥ 2.
We conclude this appendix with the following trivial observations.

Proposition 12.8 Let U = Πj≤kUj ⊂ Ck be an admissible open set with respect
to some (α, β) ∈ Ma,b.

(i) Let θj : Uj → D be a conformal map and let πj : (ζ1, . . . , ζk) → ζj be the
j-th cooordinate projection. If f ∈ H ∞(D) is outer, then f ◦ θj ◦ πj is strongly
outer on U.

(ii) The Smirnov class S(U ) contains all holomorphic functions on U having

polynomial growth at inﬁnity.

Proof: (i) Since f is strongly outer on D, there exists a sequence (fn)n≥1 of
invertible elements of H ∞(D) satisfying the conditions of deﬁnition 12.6 with
respect to f. Then the sequence (fn ◦ θj ◦ πj)n≥1 satisﬁes the conditions of
deﬁnition 12.6 with respect to f ◦ θj ◦ πj, and so f ◦ θj ◦ πj is strongly outer on
U.

(ii) For j ≤ k there exists γj ∈ [−π, π) and mj ∈ R such that open set Uj
is contained in the open half plane Pj := {ζj ∈ C | Re(ζjeiγj ) ≥ mj}. The

Now assume that a function F holomorphic on U has polynomial growth at
j is bounded on U, and so

inﬁnity. Then there exists p ≥ 1 such that F Πj≤kF p
F ∈ S(U ). (cid:3)
