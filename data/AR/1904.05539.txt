ON THE POLARIZED NONTHERMAL EMISSION FROM AR SCORPII

ABSTRACT
We study linear polarization of optical emission from white dwarf (WD) binary system AR Scorpii.
The optical emission from this binary is modulating with the beat frequency of the system, and it is
highly polarized, with the degree of the polarization reaching
40%. The angle of the polarization
monotonically increases with the spin phase, and the total swing angle can reach 360◦ over one
spin phase.
It is also observed that the morphology of the pulse proﬁle and the degree of linear
polarization evolve with the orbital phase. These polarization properties can constrain the scenario
for nonthermal emission from AR Scorpii. In this paper, we study the polarization properties predicted
by the emission model, in which (i) the pulsed optical emission is produced by the synchrotron emission
from relativistic electrons trapped by magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD and (ii) the emission is mainly
produced at magnetic mirror points of the electron motion. We ﬁnd that this model can reproduce
the large swing of the polarization angle, provided that the distribution of the initial pitch angle
of the electrons that are leaving the M-type star is biased to a smaller angle rather than a uniform
distribution. The observed direction of the swing suggests that the Earth viewing angle is less than 90◦
measured from the WD spin axis. The current model prefers an Earth viewing angle of 50◦
60◦ and
a magnetic inclination angle of 50◦
130◦). We discuss that the diﬀerent contribution
−
of the emission from M-type star to total emission causes a large variation in the pulsed fraction and
the degree of the linear polarization along the orbital phase.

1. INTRODUCTION
AR Scorpii (hereafter AR Sco) is a binary system com-
posed of a white dwarf (WD) and an M-type main-
sequence star, which has a radius of R∗ ∼
0.3R⊙ and a
0.3M⊙ (Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley et al.
mass of M∗ ∼
2017). The WD of AR Sco shows fast spinning with
a period of PW D ∼
117s and an orbital period of
3.65hr. The distance to the system from Earth
Porb ∼
is estimated to be d
110pc. AR Sco is the ﬁrst WD
that shows a radio emission modulating with the spin
period of the WD. Marsh et al. (2016) measure a spin-
10−17Hz s−1 and
down rate of the WD of
108G for the surface magnetic ﬁeld of the
estimate Bs ∼
WD. Potter & Buckley (2018a), on the other hand, re-
port that new optical data are inconsistent with the pub-
lished spin-down rate but consistent with a constant spin
period. Later, Stiller et al. (2018) measure a spin-down
10−17Hz s−1. Although more obser-
rate of
vation would be required to determine the spin down
rate, the suggested values indicate that the radiation
from AR Sco is powered by dissipation of the high mag-
netic ﬁeld (> 108G) of the WD. AR Sco could eventually
evolve to a ’polar’, for which a suﬃciently large magnetic
ﬁeld locks the two stars into synchronous rotation with
an orbital period of
500minutes (Ferrario et al.
2015).

AR Sco is very unique WD binary system with a
pulsed emission from the radio to soft X-ray bands
(Marsh et al. 2016; Takata et al. 2018) and with a lin-
ear polarization of the optical emission (Buckley et al.

∼

2017; Potter & Buckley 2018b). Marsh et al. (2016) re-
port that the radio/optical/UV emission from AR Sco is
νo, where νs
modulating with a beat frequency (νb = νs −
and νo are the spin frequency of the WD and orbital fre-
quency, respectively), and the pulse proﬁle averaged over
the orbital phase shows a double-peak structure with
0.5 in the optical/UV bands
a phase separation of
and < 0.5 in the radio bands. Takata et al. (2018) ﬁnd
that the soft X-ray emission from AR Sco also modu-
lates with the beat frequency, and the positions of the
double peak are aligned with the optical/UV peak. This
multiwavelength observation suggests that the same pop-
ulation of electrons produces the observed pulsed emis-
sion from radio to soft X-ray band. The evolution of
the pulse proﬁle of optical/UV emission along the or-
bital phase is also observed (Potter & Buckley 2018b;
Takata et al. 2018). Based on the results of data taken by
the Optical/UV Monitor Telescope on XM M -Newton,
Takata et al. (2018) report that the pulse proﬁle in op-
tical/UV bands evolves with the orbital phase, and it
changes from the double-peak structure around inferior
conjunction of the M-type star’s orbit to a broader peak
with no clear double-peak structure at the superior con-
junction. Since no accretion feature has been discovered
in the X-ray emission (Marsh et al. 2016; Takata et al.
2018), the broadband emission likely originates from the
synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons.

It is observed that the WD heats up a half-hemisphere
of the M-type star. Besides the modulation of the
beat frequency, the radio, optical, and X-ray emis-
sions of AR Sco also show the orbital modulation
(Marsh et al. 2016; Takata et al. 2018; Stanway et al.
2018; Stiller et al. 2018). The intensity peak of the emis-
sion is observed at around the superior conjunction of
the M-type star’s orbit. The spectrum of the X-ray com-
ponent modulating with the orbit is well explained by

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

the emission from the optically thin thermal plasma with
It
several diﬀerent temperatures (Takata et al. 2018).
has been observed that the optical maximum is prior to
the superior conjunction and gradually shifts with time
(Littleﬁeld et al. 2017). Katz (2017) interprets this or-
bital shift as a consequence of either (1) major magnetic
dissipation at the leading surface of the M-type star or
(2) the precession of the WD’s spin axis. These ob-
served properties of the orbital modulation will be con-
sistent with the scenario that the spin of the M-type
star is synchronized with the orbital motion and the
half-hemisphere (day side) of the M-type star is heated
by the WD’s magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic dissipa-
tion/reconnection process on the M-type star surface will
heat up the plasma to a temperature of several keV and
also accelerate the electrons to a relativistic speed.

Another evidence of

the nonthermal emission of
AR Sco is the discovery of the linear polarization in the
optical bands (Buckley et al. 2017). The polarization of
the optical emission from AR Sco is characterized by a
large linear polarization and a large swing of the polar-
ization angle (P.A.) along the spin phase (φs) of the WD.
The polarization degree can reach
40% at pulse peak,
and the P.A. swings
360 degree in one spin phase. A
recent extensive study found that the pulse proﬁle of the
polarized emission is remarkably stable over time and
from orbit to orbit (Potter & Buckley 2018a,b). These
polarization features also support the hypothesis that
the pulsed emission originates from the synchrotron ra-
diation in the magnetosphere of the WD. Interestingly,
Potter & Buckley (2018b) measure a circular polariza-
tion, peaking at a value of
3%. Unlike the optical emis-
sion, the radio emission from AR Sco shows a weak linear
polarization (
10%), but a strong circular polarization
that can reach a the level of 30%. Stanway et al. (2018)
conclude that the radio emission of AR Sco is dominated
by cyclotron emission from nonrelativistic particles on
the M-type star.

≤

∼

×

After the discovery of the pulsed emission from the
AR Sco, several studies have discussed the emission sce-
nario. Geng et al. (2016) discuss that the M-type star
interacts with the WD’s open magnetic ﬁeld lines that
extend beyond the light cylinder (̟ = PW Dc/2π =
1011cm), and an electron/positron beam from the
5.6
WD’s polar cap sweeping the stellar wind. They argue
that a bow shock propagating into the stellar wind accel-
erates the electrons in the wind. In Takata et al. (2017),
we argue that the magnetic interaction on the M-type
star surface creates a population of the relativistic elec-
trons, and the closed magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD
trap the accelerated electrons by the magnetic mirror-
ing. We propose that the synchrotron emission from the
ﬁrst magnetic mirror point after the injection from the
M-type star dominates the observed emission, and the
double-peak proﬁle occurs as a result of the contribution
of the emission from both the north and south poles.
Potter & Buckley (2018a,b) also argued that an increase
in synchrotron emission toward each magnetic mirror
point would explain the beat modulation of the opti-
cal emission. They suggest that the double-peak struc-
ture can be understood as a result of the double-lobed
emission proﬁle of synchrotron beaming from the two
poles. Bednarek (2018) discusses the nonthermal emis-

→

sion of AR Sco with a hadronic model. The model argues
that the relativistic electrons and hadrons are acceler-
ated in a strongly magnetized turbulent region around
the M-type star and that the primary electrons and/or
secondary electron/positron pairs from decay of pions
(p + p

π0 + π±) produce nonthermal radiation.
Potter & Buckley (2018b) study the geometry of the
synchrotron emission in order to explain the polarization
characteristic. They ﬁnd that the emission site locked in
the WD rotating frame can reproduce detailed features
of the observed polarization, while the emission region
irradiation face of the
ﬁxed in the binary frame (e.g.
secondary star) could not. They argue that the emission
is around the magnetic mirror point and suggest that the
polarization modulation occurs as a result of an enhanced
injection of relativistic electrons into the magnetosphere
of the WD when the magnetic axis points toward the
secondary.

In this paper, we will apply our emission scenario
(Takata et al. 2017) to calculate the polarization char-
acteristic, since the polarization information provides an
additional constraint on it. In Potter & Buckley (2018b),
a geometrical model is explored to discuss the polar-
ization characteristic.
In the present paper, on the
other hand, we will calculate the polarization of the syn-
chrotron radiation by solving dynamics of the injected
electrons. We will discuss how the polarization charac-
teristic depends on the parameters, e.g. the initial pitch
angle, system inclination angle, etc. We constrain the
direction of the spin axis of the WD projected on the
sky and the Earth viewing angle from the observed po-
larization characteristics.

In section 2, we brieﬂy introduce our emission model
and also introduce our method to calculate the linear po-
larization of the synchrotron emission. In section 3, we
summarize our results and show how the angle and de-
gree of the linear polarization evolve with the spin phase.
We also discuss the dependency of the polarization char-
acteristics on the orbital phase and the viewing geometry.
In section 4, we summarize our results and discuss the
possible viewing geometry inferred from the polarization
characteristics. Finally, we argue the diﬀerence between
the optical emission processes of the AR Sco and a neu-
tron star pulsar, the Crab (PSR B0531+21).

2.1. Energy injection
Figure 1 illustrates the schematic view of the AR Sco
system explored in this paper. As depicted in Figure 1,
we deﬁne the zero orbital phase (Φo = 0) at the inferior
conjunction of the orbit of the M-type star. We assume
that a magnetic dissipation process eventually causes an
ablation of the matter (hadrons and electrons) from the
M-type star surface and an acceleration of the electrons
to the relativistic speed. We estimate the dissipation rate
from (Lai 2012; Buckley et al. 2017)

Lorentz factor, γ, and the perpendicular momentum of
an electron may be described by (Harding et al. 2005)

where B is the strength of the local dipole magnetic ﬁeld,

where θp,0 is the initial pitch angle.
In this paper, we
assume a pure magnetic dipole ﬁeld of the WD, for sim-
plicity.

For each magnetic ﬁeld line that sweeps across the
M-type star, the electrons are injected into both the
northern and souther hemispheres from the position of
the M-type star with a rate described by equation (2).
The injected electrons with an initial pitch angle of
θp,0 > (R/a)3/2 cannot reach the stellar surface owing
to the magnetic mirror eﬀect, and they are trapped be-
tween two mirror points connected by the magnetic ﬁeld
line. Such a trapped electron will be eventually absorbed
by the M-type star.

In the current model, the emission from the ﬁrst mag-
netic mirror points mainly contribute to the observed
emission, and the peak in the light curve is formed by
the emission from the electrons that are injected when
the magnetic pole points toward the companion (for de-
tails, see Takata et al. 2017). In Figure 1, for example,
the north pole points toward the secondary, and emis-
sion from the electron injected into the southern hemi-
sphere creates one peak. After 0.5 spin phase, the south
pole points toward the secondary, and emission from the
electron injected into the northern hemisphere creates
another peak.

2.3. Radiation process
The observed nonthermal spectrum extends from the
radio to the soft X-ray bands. To explain such a broad-
band spectrum, we assume that the acceleration process
on the M-type star surface forms a power-law distribu-
tion in the electron’s Lorentz factor:
f (γ) = K0γ−p, γmin ≤

2.4. Polarization
In this section, we describe our method to calculate
the polarization of the synchrotron radiation from the
trapped electrons. We apply the method developed by
Takata et al. (2007), where we calculate the polarization
characteristic of the synchrotron radiation from the elec-
trons/positrons in the magnetosphere of the Crab pulsar.
The unit vector of the velocity of the electron gyrating
around the magnetic ﬁeld line may be described by

~ne =

±

β0 cos θp~b|| + β0 sin θp~b⊥ + βco~eφ,

(9)

where the vectors ~b|| = ~B/B, ~b⊥, and ~eφ represent the
unit vectors along the magnetic ﬁeld line, perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld, and in the azimuthal (corotation
with the WD) direction, respectively. The plus sign and
minus sign in the ﬁrst term consider the motion parallel
and antiparallel to the magnetic ﬁeld line, respectively.
The second and third terms represent the gyration mo-
tion and the corotation motion with the WD’ spin, re-
spectively. Since the direction of the gyration motion of
the electron is counterclockwise as seen from the direc-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld, we may express the unit vector
~b⊥ as

~b⊥ = cos δφg~k + sin δφg~b

~k,

(10)

×

where ~k is any unit vector perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld line and δφg represents the phase of the gyration
motion (0
δφg < 2π). Since the electrons are relativis-
≤
tic, we calculate β0 at each position from the condition
that
= 1 and βco = ̟/̟lc, where ̟lc is the light
cylinder radius of the WD. We assume that the emission
direction of the relativistic electron coincides with the
direction of the motion given by the equation (9).

~ne|
|

We assume that after the electrons leave from the M-
type star surface, they do not gain energy and just loose
their energy via the synchrotron radiation. For the syn-
chrotron radiation, the polarization vector is parallel to
the direction of the centripetal acceleration for the gy-
ration motion, and it is perpendicular to the direction

of the local magnetic ﬁeld. From equation (10), the po-
larization direction of the synchrotron radiation may be
determined as

−

~k.

~np =

sin δφg~k + cos δφg~b
In the calculation, we deﬁne the z-axis as the spin axis
of the WD, which is assumed to be parallel to the axis of
the orbital motion (see Figure 1). The x-axis is chosen
so that the observer is located at the ﬁrst quadrant in
the (x, z) coordinate. With this coordinate system, the
direction of the observer is expressed as

(11)

×

~no = sin θo~ex + cos θo~ez,

(12)

where θo is the angle of the line of sight measured from
the spin axis ~ex and ~ez are the unit vectors.

For each emission point, we consider the emission from
all gyration phases, that is, 0
δφg < 2π, and pick up
the gyration phase that produces the synchrotron photon
propagating toward the Earth. Then, we calculate the
electric vector of the “observed” electromagnetic wave
from

≤

~Eem,i ∝

~np,i −

~np,i)~no,

(13)

where “i” denotes each radiation. The degree of the
linear polarization (hereafter P.D.) is estimated from

Πi(E) =

Fsyn(x)

,

(14)

where x = E/Esyn, Fsyn is given by the equation (8)
and Gsyn(x) = xK2/3(x), with K2/3 being the modiﬁed
Bessel function of order 2/3.

To calculate the Stokes parameters, Qi and Ui, for
each radiation, we deﬁne the polarization angle (here-
after P.A.) χi to be the angle between the polarization
vector (13) and the direction of the spin axis projected on
~ΩW D)~no (Figure 2),

For the conventional deﬁnition, the P.A. χi

Stokes parameters for each radiation are Qi(E) =
Πi(E)Ii(E) cos 2χi and Ui(E) = Πi(E)Ii(E) sin 2χi,
where Ii(E) is the intensity. By collecting the observed
radiation at each bin of the spin phase, I(φs) =

The current method cannot apply to estimate the cir-
cular polarization, since we consider only emission in the
direction of the particle motion (see equation (9)). The
synchrotron emission is in general elliptically polarized if
the viewing angle deviates from the direction of the par-
ticle motion. For a power-law distribution of electrons,

for example, the degree of the circular polarization of
the synchrotron emission from the electrons with Lorentz
factor γe is given by (Sazonov 1972; Nava et al. 2016)

where Plin is the degree of linear polarization, ψ is the
angle between the particle motion and the emission, and
Y (ψ) is the pitch-angle distribution. The ratio between
circular and linear polarization is of the order of 1/γe.
Potter & Buckley (2018b), on the other hand, measure
the circular polarization, peaking at a value of
3%.
Such a high level of the circular polarization could imply
a high level of pitch-angle anisotropy. A detailed calcu-
lation for the circular polarization is more complicated
than that for the linear polarization since we have to
take into account the emission in all directions relative
to the particle motion and the pitch-angle distribution.
We therefore focus on the linear polarization in this paper
and will discuss the circular polarization in a subsequent
study.

2.5. Pitch-angle distribution
Besides the energy distribution of the injected elec-
trons, we also consider the eﬀect of the distribution of the
pitch angle. Within the current framework of the emis-
sion model, we will see in section 3 that the pitch-angle
distribution sensitively aﬀects the polarization charac-
teristic. The distribution of the initial pitch angle of
the relativistic electrons leaving the M-type star may be
related to the acceleration process. For example, the
standard acceleration model of the neutron star pulsar
assumes that the electric ﬁeld along the magnetic ﬁeld
line produces a relativistic particle. This acceleration
process produces a population of the relativist particles
with a small pitch angle. For the shock acceleration
(e.g.
in the magnetic turbulent), on the other hand,
the accelerated particles would have various pitch an-
gles (Achterberg et al. 2001; Kartavykh et al. 2016).
In this study, we explore the pitch-angle distribution with

ligible compared to the size of the system (a
R⊙).
In the calculation, therefore, we inject the particles on
the magnetic dipole ﬁeld lines penetrating the day side
of the M-type star (a half-hemisphere), and assume that
the injection rate is the same for all magnetic ﬁeld lines.
In the calculation, we assume the inclination angle, α,

of the WD. We will present the results for Earth view-
ing angle ζ < 90◦, because the observed swing direc-
tion of the P.A. predicts it, as discussed in section 4.
The polarization characteristics predicted by α = α0 and
α = 180◦
α0 are identical from each other. In Figures 3,
4, and 6-8, the evolution of the P.A. (ﬁlled circles) along
the spin phase is presented with the pulse proﬁle (solid
histograms)

3.1. P.A. and initial pitch angle
First, we examine the pulse proﬁle and the swing of
the P.A. predicted by a speciﬁc initial pitch angle, θp,0.
Figure 3 summarizes the evolution of the P.A. (ﬁlled cir-
cles) along the spin phase of the WD for the initial pitch
angles of sin θp,0 = 0.1 (top left), 0.2 (top right), 0.4
(bottom left) and 0.8 (bottom right). The results are
for the initial Lorentz factor γ0 = 100, with which the
electrons mainly produce the optical emission with the
synchrotron radiation process.
In each panel, the pre-
dicted pulse proﬁle (solid histogram) is also plotted.

We ﬁnd in Figure 3 that the calculated P.A. shows a
large swing along the spin phase. For the pitch angle
sin θp,0 = 0.1, for example, the pulse proﬁle shows the
180◦ at
double-peak structure and the P.A. swings
each peak. The total swing of the P.A. over one spin

angle. For a larger initial pitch angle, the calculated
pulse proﬁle is more complicated, with more than two
peaks. This dependency of the pulse proﬁle and the po-
larization characteristic are related to the contribution of
the emission from the second and subsequent magnetic
mirror points and the emission from both hemispheres.
Equation (5) shows that the magnetic mirror occurs at
the inner magnetosphere for the smaller pitch angle. This
implies that a higher fraction of the initial energy of the
particles is lost by the synchrotron radiation at the ﬁrst
mirror point. For sin θp,0 = 0.1 in Figure 3, for exam-
ple, most of the initial particle energy is lost at the ﬁrst
mirror point, and the contribution of the emission from
the subsequent mirror points makes small broad bumps
between two main peaks. Since the photons detected at
each spin phase bin are contributed by a smaller region
in the magnetosphere, the angle of the linear polarization
shows a monotonic increment along the spin phase.

For a larger initial pitch angle, since the magnetic mir-
roring occurs at a smaller magnetic ﬁeld region (outer
magnetosphere), a smaller fraction of the initial energy
is released as the synchrotron radiation at the ﬁrst mir-
ror point. Hence, the emission from the subsequent mir-
ror points also creates noticeable peaks in the calculated
pulse proﬁle, as we can see in Figure 3. A wider region
in the magnetosphere contributes to the emission of each
spin phase, and therefore the resultant evolution of the
P.A. along the spin phase and the pulse proﬁle become
more complicated.

3.2. Pitch-angle distribution
Figure 4 summarizes the dependency of the polariza-
tion on the distribution of the initial pitch angle, by
assuming the inclination angle α = 60◦ and the Earth
viewing angle ζ = 60◦. The results are for the supe-
rior conjunction (Φo = 0.5).
In the ﬁgure we can see
that the predicted P.A. shows a large swing with the

consider only the Gaussian component and assume that
initial pitch angles concentrate at θ0 = 0.2 rad with a
width of σ0 = 0.2 rad.
In such a case, more injected
electrons lose their energy at the ﬁrst magnetic mirror
point, and the resultant polarization tends to increase
with the spin phase. We can expect that as we increase
the magnitude of σ0, the calculated P.A. and pulse proﬁle
shift to those of the panel (A).

By comparing the calculated pulse proﬁles (solid his-
tograms) in the panel (A) and panel (B), we ﬁnd that the
double-peak structure is more clearly shown in the pulse
proﬁle with the uniform distribution. In current model,
a strong peak is created by each hemisphere, and the
double peak structure is produced as a result of the con-
tribution of the emission from both hemisphere. When
the initial pitch angle concentrates to a smaller value, the
emission from a half hemisphere could be missed by the
observer, and the height of one peak is much lower than
other peak, as the panel (B) indicates. To explain the
observed double peak pulse proﬁles, therefore, a uniform
component may be necessary.

In panel (C) of Figure 4, we assume that the initial
pitch angle is described by the uniform component plus
the Gaussian-like component, and we present the result
with C1/C0 = 1, that is, we assume that the total parti-
cle number of the Gaussian component is equal to that
of the uniform component. For the Gaussian compo-
nent, we assume θ0 = 0.2 rad and σ0 = 0.2 rad. In the
ﬁgure, we can see that the pulse proﬁle and evolution

7

of the polarization angle are intermediate between those
in the panels of (A) and (B). For example, we can see
that the pulse height of the second peak (minor peak) is
the lower than that in panel (A), but it is higher than
that in panel (B). The evolution of the polarization an-
gle with the spin phase is not as smooth as panel (B).
We ﬁnd that with current parameters of α = 60◦ and
ζ = 60◦, 360◦ of the P.A. swing along the spin phase

can be reproduced with C1/C0 ≥
fore suggests that the particle acceleration on the M-type
star surface produces more relativistic electrons having
smaller pitch angle. As a conclusion of this section, the
two component model (panel C) of the initial pitch-angle
distribution explains better both observed double peak
structure and polarization characteristics.

The predicted anisotropy of the initial pitch an-
gle distribution might be consistent with the observed
circular polarization, peaking at a value of
3%
(Potter & Buckley 2018b). Such a high level of the circu-
lar polarization would require a high level of pitch-angle
anisotropy. The calculation of the circular polarization
based on the current model will be done in a subsequent
study.

the power-law distribution in the initial Lorentz factor
to explain the observed spectra of the pulsed emission in
optical/UV and soft X-ray bands. In this ﬁgure, we can
see that the predicted spectrum becomes harder if the
initial pitch-angle distribution is biased in the smaller
angle. This can be understood because the mirror point
for an electron with a smaller initial pitch angle is closer
to the stellar surface, and therefore the synchrotron emis-
sion at the mirror point is harder. As we can see in the
ﬁgure, the observed spectra cannot tightly constrain the
initial pitch-angle distribution.

3.3. Evolution with orbital phase
Figure 6 summarizes the dependency of the evolution
of the linear polarization (ﬁlled circles) and the pulse
proﬁles (histograms) on the orbital phase. For the pulse
proﬁle, we can see that the position of the peak shifts
with the orbital phase. In the current model, the pulse
peaks are mainly created by the emission of the electrons
injected when the magnetic axis of the WD points toward
the M-type star (Takata et al. 2017), and hence the pulse
peak shifts with the orbital motion of the M-type star.

We see in the ﬁgure that the polarization characteris-
tics and the pulse proﬁle depend on the orbital phase. At
the orbital phase Φo = 0.25 (descending node of the orbit
of the M-type star) and 0.5 (superior conjunction), for
example, the P.A. tends to increase with the spin phase,
while at Φo = 0 (inferior conjunction) and 0.75 (ascend-
ing node), the swing of the P.A. changes its direction at
spin phase 0.6
0.7. For Φo = 0, we ﬁnd a small second
peak in the calculated pulse proﬁle. Since the M-type
star is between Earth and the WD, the electrons leaving
from the M-type star move away from Earth. As a re-
sult, the strong emission from one hemisphere may not
point toward Earth.

−

We note that the predicted characteristics of the P.A.
and the pulse proﬁles at Φo = 0.25 and Φo = 0.75 are dif-
ferent from each other; nevertheless, the positions of the

 
 
8

M-type star are symmetric relatively to the axis made
by Earth and the WD. The diﬀerence originates from
the direction of the WD’s spin. In the current study, we
anticipate that the direction of the WD’s spin is parallel
to the axis of the orbital motion. At Φo = 0.25, since the
WD’s magnetic ﬁeld sweeps across the M-type star from
the Earth side to the backside, the trapped electrons ini-
tially move away from the Earth. This makes a pulse
proﬁle broader. At Φo = 0.75, the magnetic ﬁeld sweeps
across the M-type star from the backside to the Earth
side, and therefore the trapped electrons move initially
toward the Earth. The emitted photons and the emitting
electrons that continuously produce the photons may ini-
tially move in the same direction. This tends to shorten
the diﬀerence in the arrival times of the diﬀerent photons
and tends to make a sharper peak.

−

We mention that the current calculation has some dis-
crepancies from the observations. For example, the ob-
served optical/UV pulse proﬁle evolves with the orbital
phase. With OM data of the XM M -Newton telescope,
we (Takata et al. 2018) show that the shape of the pulse
proﬁle rapidly changes at around Φo = 0 and a small
second peak structure is found in the pulse proﬁle at
around Φo = 0.1. This feature is similar to the current
model. On the other hand, the observed pulse proﬁle
0.6 is described by a broad pulse proﬁle
at Φ0 = 0.5
with no clear second peak, while the current pulse proﬁle
shows a double-peak structure. For the optical polariza-
tion, Potter & Buckley (2018b) show that the total swing
of the P.A. over the spin phase is 360◦ and does not de-
pend on the orbital phase. As we can see in Figure 6,
the current calculation predicts that the total swing of
the P.A. at ΦO = 0 and 0.75 phases is less than 360◦.
A ﬁne-tuning for parameters (e.g. initial Lorentz factor
and pitch-angle distribution and system geometry) will
be required to obtain a total 360◦ swing for the whole
orbital phase. This diﬀerence between the model and
observation could also indicate that the realistic geome-
try and structure of the magnetosphere (e.g. magnetic
ﬁeld structure) are more complicated comparing to cur-
rent simple treatment. For example, the dipole ﬁeld ap-
proximation could be a very rough treatment owing to
the interaction with the companion star.

3.4. Dependency on the geometry
Within the current framework of the model, we ﬁnd
that the calculated polarization characteristic depends
on the viewing geometry. For example, Figures 7 and
8 summarize the dependency of the inclination angle of
the magnetic axis of the WD and the Earth viewing an-
gle, respectively. Using the orbital phase Φo = 0.5, the
Earth viewing angle ζ = 60◦, and C0 = C1, Figure 7
compares the results for α = 50◦ (left panel), 60◦ (mid-
dle panel), and 70◦ (right panel). In the ﬁgure, we can
see the tendency of an increase in the P.A. along the spin
phase for inclination angles α = 50◦ and 60◦, while we
see a complicated evolution for α = 70◦. For α = 70◦, we
can see many sharp peaks in the calculated pulse proﬁle.
This shows that with a speciﬁc Earth viewing angle, the
emission from the second and subsequent mirror points
also contributes to the observed emission and produces a
complicated evolution of the P.A. swing. We ﬁnd there-
fore that the current model prefers the magnetic incli-
60◦ to produce a 360◦ swing
nation angle of α = 50◦

−

of the P.A. along the spin phase. For a nearly aligned
rotator, on the other hand, the model does not predict
the double-peak structure, as discussed in Takata et al.
(2017).

In Figure 8, we summarize the dependency of the
viewing angle on the polarization characteristics with
α = 50◦, Φo = 0.5, and C0 = C1. With these parame-
ters, we can see in the ﬁgure that a smaller viewing angle
(ζ = 50◦ and ζ = 60◦) shows a monotonic increase in the
P.A. with the spin phase, and for a larger viewing an-
gle (right panel for ζ = 70◦), the P.A. changes its swing
direction at a spin phase. This dependency on the view-
ing angle also comes from the dependency of the contri-
bution from both hemispheres. From the pulse proﬁles
(histograms in the ﬁgure), we can see that the height
0.7 increases as the Earth
of the second peak at φs ∼
viewing angle increases. This is related to the fact that
when we look at the system from an angle closer to the
equator, the diﬀerence in the contribution of the emis-
sion from the two hemispheres decreases (for the observer
with ζ = 90◦, the contributions from two hemispheres are
even). This makes the evolution of the P.A. swing and
the pulse proﬁle more complicated. For viewing angle
0◦, on the other hand, we expect no or smaller mod-
ζ
ulation of the observed ﬂux with the spin/beat phase.
As a result, the current model prefers the Earth viewing
60◦, as well as the magnetic inclination
angle, ζ = 50◦
60◦.

3.5. Degree of linear polarization
The observed optical emission will be composed of two
components: (1) thermal emission from the M-type star
surface and (2) nonthermal emission from the relativis-
tic particles, as Figure 5 indicates. It has been observed
that the pulsed fraction, which is deﬁned by the equa-
fmin)/(fmax + fmin), with fmax and fmin
tion (fmax −
being the maximum and minimum counts in the pulse
proﬁle, depends on the photon energy bands and on the
orbital phase; it becomes maximum around the inferior
conjunction (hereafter INFC) of the M-type star’s orbit
and minimum around the superior conjunction (hereafter
SUPC). For example, the pulsed fraction of the UV emis-
sion is
40% at the
SUPC (Takata et al. 2018). Moreover, it has been ob-
served that the P.D. of the optical emission also depends
on the orbital phase and may be related to the pulsed
fraction. Buckley et al. (2017) report that the the P.D.
40% at the orbital phase
can reach at the level of

the M-type stellar surface is unpolarized. Then, we add
the unpolarized emission as a DC emission to reduce the
pulsed fraction to 10%. The calculated P.D. (red line in

4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
The swing direction of the observed linear polarization
will be able to constrain the viewing geometry. In the
previous section, we assumed that the viewing angle is
smaller than ζ < 90◦ measured from the WD’s spin axis.
This condition is necessary to explain the swing direc-
tion of the observed P.A. with the spin phase, that is,
counterclockwise. For the viewing angle with ζ > 90◦,
the expected direction is clockwise. The diﬀerence in
the swing directions for the two viewing angles mainly
comes from the diﬀerence in the directions of the mag-
netic ﬁeld line projected on the sky. We note that for a
speciﬁc viewing angle, the inclination angles α = α0 and
α = 180◦
α0 do not make any diﬀerence in the mor-
phology of the pulse proﬁle and the polarization charac-
teristics, since the directions of the magnetic ﬁeld lines
projected on the sky for the two inclination angles are
identical. Hence, the required condition that ζ < 90◦
does not depend on whether the magnetic inclination an-
gle is larger or smaller than 90◦.

−

In Figure 3 of Buckley et al. (2017), we can see the
spin phase where the swing angle of the observed P.A.

ﬁgure). In our results, a similar trend can be seen in the
calculated evolution of the P.A. In Figure 6, for example,
we ﬁnd a spin phase where the direction of the linear
90◦ for Φo = 0.5
polarization is almost constant at P.A.
0◦ (and 180◦) for Φo=0, 0.25, and 0.75.
and at P.A.
Figure 7 and 8 also suggest that the P.A. of the ﬂat region
does not depend on the inclination angle and viewing
angle. In our deﬁnition, the direction of the P.A.= 0◦
(or 90◦) is parallel (or perpendicular) to the direction of
the projected spin axis. Therefore, a detailed comparison
between the observed and calculated P.A. may enable us
to determine the direction of the spin axis of the WD
projected on the sky.

108cm for the Crab and 5.6

The double-peak structure of the pulse proﬁle, the
large P.D., and the large swing of the polarization angle
of the optical emission from AR Sco resemble those of the
Crab pulsar (Kanbach et al. 2005). Based on our emis-
sion model, however, we would like to say that although
the emission process is the synchrotron radiation for the
two cases, the particle acceleration/emission regions are
very diﬀerent from each other. It has usually been argued
that the nonthermal emission of the neutron star pul-
sar originates from the open ﬁeld line region, for which
the magnetic ﬁeld lines extend beyond the light cylin-
der that is deﬁned by the axial distance ̟lc = Psc/2π
1011cm for the
(
∼
WD in AR Sco), and the emission takes place around the
light cylinder. For the AR Sco, the M-type star orbits at
1010cm inside the light cylinder of the WD, and
a
hence the emission probably originates from the closed
magnetic ﬁeld line region, as we have discussed in this
paper. For the Crab pulsar, the pair-creation process of
the GeV gamma-rays creates the electrons and positrons
that emit the synchrotron photons. (Takata et al. 2007;
Takata & Chang 2007). These secondary pairs will have
0.1, and the emission from
a small pitch angle of sin θp ∼
them covers a part of the sky. A special relativistic ef-
fect (e.g. ﬂight time and aberration) makes a peak in
the observed pulse proﬁle of the Crab pulsar. In the cur-
rent model of the AR Sco, the mirror point of the closed
magnetic ﬁeld is the main emission region, and the spe-
cial relativistic eﬀect is less important to form a peak in
the pulse proﬁle.

In summary, we have studied the linear polarization of

 
 
 
the nonthermal optical emission from AR Sco with the
model developed by Takata et al. (2017). In the model,
the relativistic electrons trapped by the closed magnetic
ﬁeld line region produce the nonthermal emission with
the synchrotron process. We have found that the calcu-
lated linear polarization can have a large swing through
the spin phase, although the evolution of the P.A. with
the spin phase depends on various factors (e.g. orbital
phase, initial pitch-angle distribution, and viewing ge-
ometries). The total swing of the observed P.A. over the
spin period can be 360◦. To explain the large swing an-
gle and the double-peak structure of the pulse proﬁle, the
current model suggests (1) an isotropy of the initial pitch-
angle distribution, which is biased to a smaller value, and

sion from the relativistic electrons dominates the emis-
sion from the stellar surface. The diﬀerent contribution
of the emission from the M-type star on the observed op-
tical emission will explain the evolution of the observed
P.D. with the orbital phase. We have discussed that the
origin of the nonthermal emission of the AR Sco is dif-
ferent from the neutron-star-pulsar-like emission process.
However, AR Sco is only a sample of the pulsed nonther-
mal emission from the magnetic WD. More samples will
be necessary to understand the nonthermal nature of the
magnetic WDs and the similarity/dissimilarity with the
non-thermal emission from neutron star pulsars.
