Abstract 

New experimental data are collected for methyl-cyclohexane (MCH) autoignition in a heated rapid 

compression machine (RCM). Three mixtures of MCH/O2/N2/Ar at equivalence ratios of 𝜙=0.5, 1.0, and 

1.5 are studied and the ignition delays are measured at compressed pressure of 50 bar and for compressed 

temperatures in the range of 690–900 K. By keeping the fuel mole fraction in the mixture constant, the 

order of reactivity, in terms of inverse ignition delay, is measured to be 𝜙=0.5 > 𝜙=1.0 > 𝜙=1.5, 

demonstrating the dependence of the ignition delay on oxygen concentration. In addition, an existing 

model for the combustion of MCH is updated with new reaction rates and pathways, including substantial 

updates to the low-temperature chemistry. The new model shows good agreement with the overall 

ignition delays measured in this study, as well as the ignition delays measured previously in the literature 

using RCMs and shock tubes. This model therefore represents a strong improvement compared to the 

previous version, which uniformly over-predicted the ignition delays. Chemical kinetic analyses of the 

updated mechanism are also conducted to help understand the fuel decomposition pathways and the 

reactions controlling the ignition. Combined, these results and analyses suggest that further investigation 

of several of the low-temperature fuel decomposition pathways is required.

Introduction 

Cycloalkanes and alkyl-cycloalkanes (collectively known as naphthenes) are well known major 

components in several transportation fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels [1–4]. Since these 

transportation fuels have hundreds or thousands of individual chemical components, incorporation of all 

these components in a kinetic model would make the model very difficult to build and computationally 

expensive to use. To facilitate modeling such real fuels, it is necessary to formulate a surrogate mixture 

by selectively choosing a much smaller set of neat components that will reproduce the physical and 

chemical behavior of the target fuel. Methyl-cyclohexane (MCH) is frequently suggested as a candidate 

component in these formulations to represent the naphthene content of real fuels [5,6]. Furthermore, an 

understanding of MCH kinetics can provide the base from which to build models of the combustion of 

other naphthenes. 

Many studies have been conducted to examine the combustion behavior of naphthenes, and such an 

extensive literature review is beyond the scope of this work; we therefore limit our focus in the following 

to MCH and the conditions of particular interest to this study. The interested reader is directed to the 

review of Pitz and Mueller [7] for a comprehensive discussion of experimental and modeling work 

relevant to naphthenes. 

If chemical kinetic models are to be used in engine design, it is critical that they are able to reproduce 

the combustion behavior of fuels under the thermodynamic conditions prevalent in engines. Furthermore, 

they must be of an appropriate size to enable calculations on a reasonable time scale. So-called “reduced 

mechanisms” suitable for design calculations are typically validated by comparison to the detailed 

mechanisms from which they are derived. Thus, it is critical that the detailed mechanism first be able to 

reproduce the combustion properties of a given fuel under the desired conditions. 

New engines, using advanced concepts such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) 

and reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), incorporate Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) 

to help achieve the goals of improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions. However, a detailed 

understanding of LTC reaction pathways is often required to properly predict the combustion phasing, 

3 

 
heat release rates, and engine-out emissions of such engine concepts. In addition, since HCCI and RCCI 

engines operate at high pressures and their combustion performance is sensitive to fuel chemistry, the 

chemical kinetic models used in engine simulations need to be validated at these conditions. Therefore, 

experimental data acquired at engine-relevant conditions are of critical importance for validating chemical 

kinetic model performance. 

One of the most common global validation parameters for kinetic models is the ignition delay. The 

ignition delay is especially relevant to reciprocating engines, as it helps determine the combustion phasing 

and heat release rate of a fuel. Ignition delays of MCH have been measured in shock tubes [8–13] and 

rapid compression machines (RCMs) [14–16] by a number of researchers. These studies collectively 

cover the temperature-pressure space in the range of 700–2100 K and 1–70 atm. To complement this 

experimental work, a number of kinetic models for MCH combustion have been constructed, notably by 

Orme et al. [12] and Pitz et al. [15]. 

However, the existing models are not able to predict ignition delays at conditions for which they were 

not validated (i.e. the models are not truly predictive). For instance, previous work conducted in an RCM 

by Mittal and Sung [16] measured the ignition delays of MCH/O2/N2/Ar mixtures at pressures of 15.1 and 

25.5 bar, for three equivalence ratios of 𝜙=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, and over the temperature range of 680–840 

K. They compared their measured ignition delays to simulated ignition delays computed using the 

mechanism of Pitz et al. [15] and found that the model over-predicted both the first stage and overall 

ignition delay substantially [16]. 

In view of the above, the objectives of this work are twofold. The first objective is to collect new 

autoignition data in an RCM at a higher pressure of 50 bar and over a temperature range that includes the 

LTC range. The datasets include the pressure history that relates to the heat release rates in the RCM, the 

first stage ignition delay time that is characteristic of the low temperature combustion, and the total 

ignition delay time that corresponds to hot ignition in an engine. The second objective of this paper is to 

update the reaction pathways and rate constants of important reactions in the kinetic model of Pitz et al. 

[15] and use the previously and newly obtained RCM data to validate the updated model. By comparing 

4 

 
the experimental and simulated ignition delay results and conducting chemical kinetic analyses of the 

updated mechanism, the fuel decomposition pathways and the controlling reactions for autoignition are 

identified and discussed. 

2.  Methods 

2.1.  Quantum Chemical Calculations 

Since RO2 isomerization rate constants were available for cyclohexane but not for methylcyclohexane, ab 

initio calculations were performed at LLNL by the authors for a particularly important RO2 isomerization 

that involves an abstraction from the methyl group. Specifically, the isomerization is for the 2-

methylcyclohexyl-1-peroxy radical, in which the –OO group is attached at the beta position relative to the 

methyl group. This reaction was shown to potentially have a large rate constant because of its low 

activation energy, as calculated by Yang et al. [17]. Because we needed the pre-exponential factor that 

was not reported in the work by Yang et al. [17], we calculated the high-pressure rate constant using the 

CBS-QB3 composite method [18]. The reactant, product, and transition state geometries and frequencies 

were calculated using the Gaussian09 suite of programs [19]. The lowest energy conformations were 

obtained from relaxed scans around each rotor in 60° increments using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p). Reaction 

rates and Eckart tunneling factors were determined using ChemRate [20]. The transition state was 

confirmed by the presence of a single imaginary frequency that corresponds to the reaction pathway and 

IRC calculations using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p). The reaction rate was determined using a rigid rotor 

harmonic oscillator approximation with corrections for hindered rotors. Hindered rotors were accounted 

for using the Pitzer and Gwinn 1D hindered rotor method within ChemRate, with the rotational barriers 

being determined via relaxed scans in 10° increments using B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) [21]. The high-pressure 

rate-limited reaction rate was fit to a three-parameter Arrhenius rate expression over the temperature 

range of 300–2500 K.

2.2.  Experimental Methods 

The experimental facility consists of a rapid compression machine, a mixture preparation system, and 

diagnostics. For mixture preparation, the fuel and oxidizer pre-mixtures are prepared in a stainless steel 

mixing tank. The volume of the tank is approximately 17 L so that many experiments can be run from a 

single batch. The liquid fuel (methyl-cyclohexane, 99.0% purity) is massed to a precision of 0.01 g in a 

syringe before being injected into the mixing tank through a septum. The proportions of oxygen 

(99.9999% purity), nitrogen (99.9995% purity), and argon (99.9999% purity) are determined by 

specifying the oxidizer composition, the equivalence ratio, and the total mass of fuel. The gases are added 

to the mixing tank manometrically at room temperature.  

The mixing tank, reaction chamber, and all lines connecting them are equipped with heaters to 

prevent condensation of the fuel. The partial pressure of the fuel is kept below the saturation vapor 

pressure for all preheat temperatures and equivalence ratios studied. After filling the tank, the heaters are 

turned on and the system is allowed approximately 1.5 hours to equilibrate. The mixture is stirred 

continuously by a magnetic vane to ensure mixture homogeneity. This procedure has been validated in 

several previous studies [22–24]. In these studies, the concentrations of n-butanol, n-decane, and water 

were verified by GCMS, GC-FID, and GC-TCD, respectively, to be within 5% of the expected value. 

Three different mixtures of MCH/O2/N2/Ar are prepared in this study, as outlined in Table 1. These 

mixtures (denoted as Mix #1–3) match the mixtures prepared in our previous work with MCH in the 

RCM [16]. The equivalence ratios corresponding to Mix #1–3 are 𝜙=1.0, 0.5, and 1.5, respectively. As in 

the previous RCM experiments, the mole fraction of MCH is held constant and the mole fraction of O2 is 

varied to adjust the equivalence ratio. This experimental design allows these data to be used to validate 

chemical kinetic models for changes in O2 concentration, which is an important variable in internal 

combustion engines where exhaust gas recirculation is used to reduce the oxygen concentrations to avoid 

NOx formation. Few validation data for ignition are available for changing oxygen concentrations. In 

addition, the relative proportions of O2, N2, and Ar are adjusted so that the same specific heat ratio is 

maintained in the three mixtures. The utility of this experimental design will be discussed in due course.

The RCM used for these experiments is a pneumatically-driven/hydraulically-stopped single-piston 

arrangement and has been described in detail previously [25]. At the start of an experimental run, the 

piston rod is held in the retracted position by hydraulic pressure while the reaction chamber is vacuumed 

to less than one torr. Then, the reaction chamber is filled with the required initial pressure of test gas 

mixture from the mixing tank. The compression is triggered by releasing the hydraulic pressure. The 

piston assembly is driven forward to compress the test mixture by high-pressure nitrogen gas. The gases 

in the test section are brought to the compressed pressure (𝑃𝐶) and compressed temperature (𝑇𝐶) 

conditions in approximately 30 milliseconds. The piston in the reaction chamber is machined with a 

specifically designed crevice to ensure that the roll-up vortex effect is suppressed and homogeneous 

conditions in the reaction chamber are promoted. 

The homogenous conditions in the reaction chamber allow the assumption that the reactants are 

compressed nearly adiabatically [25]. Therefore, 𝑃𝐶 and 𝑇𝐶 are only a function of the temperature-

dependent specific heat ratio of the reactants, the compression ratio, and the initial conditions. In the 

present study design, the specific heat ratio of the reactants is held constant across the three equivalence 

ratios, as mentioned previously. Thus, for given 𝑃𝐶, compression ratio, and initial conditions, the 𝑇𝐶 will 

be the same for all the equivalence ratios. 

In the present operation procedure, 𝑃𝐶 and 𝑇𝐶 can be varied independently by adjusting the volumetric 

compression ratio and the initial temperature (𝑇0) and initial pressure (𝑃0) of the test charge. The pressure 

in the reaction chamber is monitored during and after compression by a rapid-response, thermal-shock 

resistant piezoelectric dynamic pressure transducer (Kistler 6125B). During the filling of the mixing tank 

and reaction chamber prior to compression, the pressure is monitored by a static pressure transducer. 

7 

 
 
Figure 1 shows a representative pressure trace from these experiments at 𝑃𝐶=50 bar, 𝑇𝐶=761 K, and 

𝜙=1.5 (Mix #3). The definitions of the end of compression (EOC) and the ignition delays are indicated on 

the figure. The end of compression time is defined as the time when the pressure reaches its maximum 

before first stage ignition occurs, or for cases where there is no first stage ignition, the maximum pressure 

before the overall ignition occurs. The first stage ignition delay is the time from the end of compression 

until the first peak in the time derivative of the pressure. The overall ignition delay is the time from the 

end of compression until the largest peak in the time derivative of the pressure. 

Figure 1 also shows a non-reactive pressure trace. Due to heat loss from the test mixture to the cold 

reactor walls, the pressure and temperature of the gas in the reaction chamber will decrease after the end 

of compression. A non-reactive pressure trace is measured that corresponds to each unique 𝑃𝐶 and 𝑇𝐶 

condition studied to quantify the effect of the heat loss on the ignition process and to verify that no heat 

release has occurred during the compression stroke. The non-reactive pressure trace is acquired by 

replacing the oxygen in the oxidizer with nitrogen, so that the specific heat ratio of the initial mixture is 

maintained, but the heat release due to exothermic oxidation reactions is eliminated. Maintaining a similar 

specific heat ratio ensures that the non-reactive experiment faithfully reproduces the conditions of the 

reactive experiment. A representative non-reactive pressure trace is shown in Fig. 1 corresponding to the 

experimental conditions in the figure. 

Each unique 𝑃𝐶 and 𝑇𝐶 condition is repeated at least 6 times to ensure repeatability of the experiments. 

The  experiment  closest  to  the  mean  of  the  runs  at  a  particular  condition  is  chosen  for  analysis  and 

presentation. The standard deviation of all of the runs at a condition is less than 10% of the mean in all 

cases. Furthermore, to ensure reproducibility, each new mixture preparation is checked against a previously 

run condition before new data is collected using that mixture.

2.3.  Numerical Methods 

In simulations, a volume history is used to account for the effects of the compression stroke and heat loss 

in the experiments. These volume histories are derived from the reactive and non-reactive pressure traces 

collected for each unique 𝑃𝐶 and 𝑇𝐶. This procedure uses the temperature-dependent specific heat ratio 

and assumes an isentropic process; the compression stroke is modeled as an isentropic compression and 

the heat loss after EOC is modeled as an isentropic volume expansion. Using the isentropic process 

relations, the volume as a function of time is calculated during and after the compression stroke. Two 

types of simulations are then conducted using the Closed Homogeneous Batch Reactor in CHEMKIN-Pro 

15131 [26]. The first type accounts for the effect of the compression stroke and post-compression heat 

loss by tabulating the reactor volume function of time using the volume trace computed by the isentropic 

relations discussed previously. The tabulated volume is referred to as the volume profile and is specified 

in the CHEMKIN-Pro input file with the VPRO keyword. Therefore, this type of simulation is referred to 

as a VPRO simulation hereafter. The second type is a constant volume, adiabatic simulation and is 

referred to as CONV hereafter, again named after the CHEMKIN-Pro input keyword used to specify this 

problem type. The CONV type simulations do not capture the effect of the compression stroke and post-

9 

 
 
 
compression heat loss; therefore, they allow direct analysis of the kinetic model with no influence of 

potentially confounding experimental effects. 

VPRO simulations are used to calculate the temperature at the end of compression, 𝑇𝐶. This 

temperature is used as the reference temperature for reporting the ignition delay. This approach requires 

the assumption of a homogeneous, adiabatic core of gases in the reaction chamber, which is facilitated on 

the present RCM by the creviced piston described previously. Simulations to determine 𝑇𝐶 are conducted 

with and without detailed reaction steps to determine if there is significant reactivity in the compression 

stroke. If there is no significant reactivity (and hence heat release), the pressure and temperature at EOC 

are the same whether or not reactions are included in the simulation. 

3.  Model Development 

The LLNL MCH chemical kinetic model has been updated to reflect new chemical kinetic information 

that has become available since the publication of our 2007 mechanism [15]. The following sub-models in 

the mechanism have been replaced: the C1-C4 base chemistry with the AramcoMech version 1.3 [27]; the 

aromatics base chemistry with the latest LLNL-NUIG model [28]; and the cyclohexane sub-model with a 

more recent version from Silke et al. [29]. In addition, there are several specific updates of the MCH 

mechanism. The abstraction reactions from MCH are replaced using recent experimentally measured 

values [30] and standardized using the latest LLNL reaction rate rules [31]. The previous 2007 MCH 

model [15] lumped many of unsaturated ring products of MCH, including methylcyclohexenes and 

methylcylcohexadienes. These species have now been expanded to include all the relevant isomers with 

their associated reaction paths and rate constants. The model now tracks the intermediate unsaturated 

methyl-cyclohexane species with much more fidelity and predicts their experimentally measured 

concentrations with much more accuracy [32]. 

Regarding the low temperature chemistry portion of the chemical kinetic mechanism, there have been 

many updates. For the R+O2 reactions involving the cyclohexane ring in MCH, the ab initio rate constants 

computed by Fernandes et al. [33] were used. They computed the rate constants from 1 to 50 bar over a 

10 

 
 
temperature range of 500–900 K. Since RO2 isomerization rate constants were available for cyclohexane 

but not for the case of a methyl substitution on the ring, ab initio calculations were performed at LLNL by 

the authors for the case of a six membered ring where the –OO group is attached at the beta position 

relative to the methyl group. These calculations are discussed in separate sections of this paper. Rate 

constants for R+O2 involving a tertiary site were not available from Fernandes et al. [33], so these rate 

constants were estimated based on the rate constants of their secondary site counterparts. The A-factors 

were adjusted for degeneracy since there is only one tertiary C-H and the activation energy was reduced 

by 2 kcal for a tertiary abstraction rather than a secondary abstraction. Since pressure dependent rate 

constants were not available for all the low temperature reactions for MCH (e.g. R+O2, RO2 

isomerization), we used the high-pressure rate constants for all of them for consistency. For the rate 

constants obtained from Fernandes et al. [33] where the high-pressure rate constant was not reported, we 

used the 50 bar rate constant. Villano and Dean [34] found that the use of the high-pressure limit for RO2 

isomerization rates worked well for n-butane when the pressure was 10 atm and above. Since the 

pressures of interest in this study are 15 bar and above, we expect this to be a good assumption here as 

well. We also consider this a good assumption for pressures encountered in internal combustion engines. 

Cyclic ether formation in cycloalkanes requires special considerations compare to acyclic alkanes. 4-

membered ring cyclic ethers are observed in the low temperature oxidation of acyclic alkanes and are 

formed from 𝛾-QOOH (the radical site is 𝛾 from the OOH group) though a 4-membered ring transition 

state. However, Gulati and Walker [35] theorized that the chair structure of cyclohexane is too rigid to 

allow the formation of the four-membered ring cyclic ether and the formation of hexenal is instead more 

energetically favored. This is supported by the experimentally observed absence of 4-membered ring 

cyclic ethers and the detection of alkenones in the oxidation of cycloalkanes. Specifically, Gulati and 

Walker [35] observed hexenal, but not 4-membered ring cyclic ether in the oxidation of cyclohexane. 

Husson et al. [36] similarly observed octenone in the oxidation of ethylcyclohexane in a jet stirred reactor 

and but not the corresponding 4-membered ring cyclic ether. In the present mechanism, the -QOOH 

forms heptenone using the rate constant computed by Fernandes et al. [33] at 50 bar for the 

11 

 
cyclohexyl+O2 system. Because of the lack of information on their oxidation, different isomers of 

heptenone have been lumped into one species in the mechanism. 

One of the changes to the mechanism was to increase the activation energy of the ketohydroperoxide 

decomposition from 39 kcal/mol (163.2 kJ/mol) (Reaction Class 28 in [31]) to 41.6 kcal/mol (174.1 

kJ/mol). 41.6 kcal/mol is the activation energy used for C4 ketohydroperoxide decomposition in the 

updated C1-C4 base chemistry from Metcalfe et al. [27]. This increase in activation energy was made to 

improve the agreement between the measured and simulated ignition delay times (as shown later), to be 

consistent with the base chemistry, and to move toward an activation energy that is closer to the O-O 

bond strength of the ketohydroperoxide (44.5 kcal based on group additivity estimates). The simulated 

ignition delay time is very sensitive to this decomposition rate constant, which is largely controlled by the 

bond strength.  Fundamental experiments and calculations are needed to obtain a more accurate estimate 

of this rate constant. 

For the thermodynamic parameters for species, we have adopted those in AramcoMech [27] for C1-C4 

species. For other new species in the mechanism such as the unsaturated cyclic species derived from 

MCH, THERM [37] was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters. 

The chemical kinetic mechanism and the thermodynamic database are available as supplemental data 

in CHEMKIN format. The reaction mechanism is fully annotated with details on the pedigree of rate 

constants not covered here. The current model contains 6498 reactions among 1540 species. 

4.  Results 

4.1.  Quantum Chemical Calculations 

In their work on the low temperature oxidation of cycloalkanes, Yang et al. [17] reported the effect of 

methyl substitution on the viability of 1,4 and 1,5 H-migration reactions. Of importance to the current 

study was their evaluation of the barrier heights of the 1,4 and 1,5 H-migration of the cis- and trans- 

forms of 2-methylcyclohexyl-1-peroxy radicals (c2McHP and t2McHP, respectively). Due to the 

preference of the equatorial arrangement of methylcyclohexane compared to the axial one, they only 

12 

 
 
reported the barrier heights involving the former. Yang et al. [17] reported barrier heights of 123.7, 120.5, 

and 92.5 kJ/mol for the 1,5 H-migrations in c2McHP for reactions involving the hydrogen on C5 and C3 

on the ring and the methyl group, respectively, while for t2McHP only the methyl site is available for a 

1,5 H-migration and has a barrier height of 96.2 kJ/mol. Unfortunately, for our purposes, Yang et al. [17] 

did not report full rate expressions. As a result, we repeated their calculations for their lowest energy 

pathway, the c2McHP 1,5 H-migration involving the migration of the methyl group hydrogen. While 

performing a conformational analysis, a lower energy structure was obtained for c2McHP (Fig. 2). By 

reducing the energy of the starting point, the barrier height increases by approximately 2.5 kJ/mol, since 

both pathways go through the same transition state. Taking into account the three-fold degeneracy of the 

hydrogens at the methyl site, a rate of 𝑘(𝑇) = 1.92106𝑇1.81𝑒–82.5/𝑅𝑇 s-1, where the activation energy is 

in kJ/mol and R is the universal gas constant, is obtained for the 1,5 H-migration, which is similar to, but 

slightly faster than, similar reactions in linear alkylperoxy radicals [38].

4.2.  Experimental Results 

The experimental ignition delays measured at the three equivalence ratios and compressed pressure of 50 

bar are shown in Fig. 3. The open symbols are the overall ignition delays and the filled symbols are the 

first stage ignition delays. The vertical error bars on the experimental data represent twice the standard 

deviation of all of the experiments at that condition. Detailed uncertainty analysis of the deduced 

compressed temperature was conducted previously by Weber et al. [22], who performed a detailed error 

propagation analysis considering the uncertainty in the initial pressure, initial temperature, initial mixture 

composition, and compressed pressure measurements. They found that the maximum uncertainty of the 

compressed temperature was approximately ±1% for their RCM experiments; since the same RCM is 

used in this study, we adopt the same temperature uncertainty. 

Figure 3: Experimentally measured ignition delays at 𝑷𝑪=50 bar for the mixture conditions in Table 1. 

The negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region is an important feature of low temperature 

ignition where the ignition delay time increases with increasing temperature. The NTC region of the 

overall ignition delay is evident in Fig. 3 for the 𝜙=1.5 case (Mix #3) and approximately includes the 

temperature range of 𝑇𝐶=775–840 K. For 𝜙=1.5, first stage ignition is evident for conditions in the range 

of 𝑇𝐶=740–800 K. 

14 

 
 
 
For 𝜙=1.0 (Mix #1), the NTC region of the overall ignition delay could not be completely resolved. 

Only three conditions in the low temperature region and three conditions in the high temperature region 

are shown in Fig. 3. The experimental pressure traces during the compression stroke for intermediate 

temperature conditions were seen to deviate from their non-reactive counterparts, demonstrating 

appreciable reactivity therein. Hence, those data are not included in Fig. 3. 

For the experiments at 𝜙=0.5 (Mix #2), only three data points in the low temperature region are 

reported and none of them exhibits two-stage ignition response. As the temperature is increased further, 

noticeable reactivity during the compression stroke is evident. 

As stated earlier, the mole fraction of MCH is held constant in this study, while the mole fraction of 

the oxidizer is changed to modify the equivalence ratio. Figure 3 demonstrates that the 𝜙=0.5 case is the 

most reactive (as judged by the inverse of the ignition delay) and the 𝜙=1.5 case is the least reactive. As 

has been shown for other fuels, including n-butanol [22] and Jet-A [39], decreasing the equivalence ratio 

by increasing the oxygen mole fraction but holding the fuel mole fraction constant increases the 

reactivity. 

4.3.  Comparison to Model 

A comparison of the experimentally measured first stage ignition delays (open symbols) and the first 

stage ignition delays computed using the updated model (lines) is shown in Figs. 4(a), 5(a), and 6(a) for 

Mix #1, #2, and #3, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the experimentally measured overall ignition 

delays (open symbols) and the overall ignition delay computed by the updated model (lines) is shown in 

Figs. 4(b), 5(b), and 6(b). The experiments include the new work being presented here at  𝑃𝐶=50 bar in 

addition to the previous RCM experiments at 𝑃𝐶=15.1 and 25.5 bar [16]. The simulations are the VPRO 

type of simulations. For some computational cases, substantial heat release during the compression stroke 

caused the computed pressure to depart from the non-reactive profile prior to EOC. Therefore, these cases 

are not shown in Figs. 4–6. For these conditions, the experimental pressure trace did not exhibit significant 

15 

 
 
heat  release  during  the  compression  stroke  and  the  experimental  pressure  at  EOC  for  the  reactive  case 

matched that of the non-reactive counterpart. The volume traces provided to the VPRO simulations are 

available  from  the  authors’  website  at  http://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu/database/rcm-database.  The 

ignition delays measured experimentally in this study are available in the Supplementary Material.  

At 15.1 and 25.5 bar for Mix #1 and #2, the overall ignition delay is very well predicted for temperatures 

above  approximately  715  K.  For  lower  temperatures  at  these  two  equivalence  ratios,  the  experimental 

ignition delays are under-predicted by the model, but the predictions are nevertheless within a factor of two 

of  the  data.  For  the  rich  case  (Mix  #3),  the  simulations  under-predict  the  ignition  delay  over  a  wider 

temperature range but the results improve as temperature increases. Again, the experimental ignition delays 

are predicted to within approximately a factor of two. At 50 bar, the ignition delays are under-predicted for 

all of the equivalence ratios studied here, but the agreement is within a factor of two. 

The first stage ignition delays for all of the pressure and equivalence ratios are under-predicted, but are 

within a factor of three of the experimental values. Furthermore, for all of the equivalence ratios tested at 

𝑃𝐶=50 bar, it is of interest to note that there are several cases where simulated ignition delays show two-

stage  response  where  the  experiment  shows  only  a  single  stage  ignition.  Nevertheless,  the  present 

mechanism is a marked improvement from the comparison performed by Mittal and Sung [16] who found 

that the ignition delays were strongly and uniformly over-predicted by the previous LLNL mechanism by 

Pitz et al. [15]. 

Figures 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c) show a comparison of selected simulated and experimentally measured 

pressure traces for Mix #1, #2, and #3, respectively, at 𝑃𝐶=50 bar. Also shown in Fig. 7 is the simulated 

non-reactive pressure trace corresponding to each experimental condition. Small differences in the heat 

loss profile for different temperatures are apparent in the non-reactive pressure traces. These differences 

arise from the changing surface area to volume ratio of the reaction chamber at the end of compression as 

the compression ratio is changed to vary the compressed temperature. This highlights the importance of 

using VPRO simulations to compare predictions of ignition delay with the experimental data.

For Mix #1, it is clear that the simulated reactive pressure trace in Fig. 7(a) at 𝑇𝐶=866 K (red dashed 

line) deviates from the non-reactive pressure trace (red dot-dot-dashed line) prior to the end of 

compression. The same is also true of the 797 K case shown for Mix #3 in Fig. 7(c). Remarkably, the 

simulated case for Mix #1 at 𝑇𝐶=866 K predicts the overall ignition delay quite well. However, due to the 

heat release prior to EOC, this simulated result is not plotted in Fig. 4. The simulated case for Mix #3 at 

𝑇𝐶=797 K is also not plotted on Fig. 6 due to the heat release prior to EOC; interestingly, this case under-

19 

 
 
 
predicts the first stage ignition delay but over-predicts the overall ignition delay. For the other simulated 

cases (black lines), the reactive pressure traces closely follow their non-reactive counterparts until the 

ignition event begins. The experimental ignition delays of these cases are under-predicted by the model. It 

is also seen in Fig. 7(c) for 𝑇𝐶=729 K that the model predicts two-stage ignition, although two-stage 

ignition is not observed experimentally. 

The current mechanism is also compared to shock tube ignition delays from the studies of Vasu et al. 

[9] and Vanderover and Oehlschlaeger [10]. Those studies considered the autoignition of stoichiometric 

mixtures of MCH with O2/N2 air. The comparison is shown in Fig. 8 for the near 50 atm data from those 

studies. Note that the experimental data shown are the raw data and are not scaled to a constant pressure, 

whereas the simulated ignition delays are at a constant initial pressure of 50 atm. It can be seen that the 

ignition  delays  are  over-predicted  over  the  nearly  entire  temperature  range  of  795–1160  K  studied. 

Nevertheless, the predicted ignition delays are within approximately a factor of 1.5 of the experiments, 

indicating good agreement overall and a substantial improvement from the previous version of the model. 

Furthermore,  the  simulations  shown  here  are  of  the  CONV  type  and  do  not  account  for  any  facility 

dependent effects present in the experiments. Although the experimentalists noted in [9,10] that the effect 

of such considerations is minimal in their studies, including facility dependent effects will tend to make the 

simulations ignite sooner and improve the agreement, especially for cases with ignition delays longer than 

approximately 1000 µs. 

As discussed in Section 3, one of the updates to the model was to increase the activation energy of 

Reaction Class 28, ketohydroperoxide decomposition, from Ea=39 kcal/mol (163.2 kJ/mol) to 41.6 

kcal/mol (174.1 kJ/mol). This update substantially improved the prediction of the low-temperature 

ignition delays, including the first stage and overall ignition delays. As mentioned by Curran et al. [40], 

“the high activation energy [of Reaction Class 28] ensures an induction period during which the 

ketohydroperoxide concentration builds up.” Furthermore, updating this activation energy does not affect 

the high-temperature ignition delays. A comparison of calculated ignition delays demonstrating the effect 

of this update is shown in Fig. 9.

5.  Discussion 

5.1.  Path Analysis 

The relatively good agreement of the updated model with the experimental data suggests that a more 

detailed analysis of the mechanism is a worthwhile exercise and such analysis may point the way to 

further improvements to the mechanism. We begin with a reaction path analysis. The present reaction 

path analysis is conducted using a CONV (adiabatic, constant-volume) type simulation for three initial 

temperatures (700 K, 800 K, and 900 K), at 25.5 bar and for Mix #1 (the stoichiometric case). For the 

other mixture conditions and pressures considered in this work, the absolute percentages for each channel 

change slightly. However, the analysis of the reaction pathways is the same for all of the equivalence 

ratios and pressures considered in the experiments presented previously. The three temperatures 

considered in this analysis correspond to the low-temperature, peak of the NTC, and high-temperature 

portions of the ignition delay curve illustrated in Fig. 9; their results are shown in Fig. 10 with plain text, 

bold text, and italic text, respectively. The path analysis presented in Fig. 10 is an integrated analysis 

where the rate of production (ROP) of each species by each reaction has been integrated with respect to 

time up to 20% fuel consumption. The integrated ROPs from each reaction are normalized by the total 

22 

 
 
 
production or destruction of that species up to 20% fuel decomposition, such that reactions that produce a 

species are normalized by the total production of the species and reactions that consume a species are 

normalized by the total consumption of that species. The percentages in Fig. 10 therefore represent the 

percent of the given reactant that is consumed to form the given product by all reactions that can form a 

particular product. Species such as hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (QOOH), alkyl hydroperoxides (ROOH), 

and methylcyclohexenes (MCH-ene) are shown as lumped on the path diagram; however, these species 

are un-lumped in the mechanism and presented as a lumped sum for simplicity in this diagram. Note that 

not all of the pathways present in the mechanism for each species are presented in Fig. 10, again for 

simplicity; the pathways that are shown in Fig. 10 typically account for more than 95% of the 

consumption of each species. 

The first step of fuel breakdown occurs by H-atom abstraction at these pressure and temperature 

conditions. None of the fuel is directly decomposed by unimolecular reactions. Each of the seven possible 

radicals are formed in comparable quantities; however, due to the symmetry of MCH, sites 2 and 3 are 

equivalent to sites 6 and 5, respectively, so mchr2 and mchr3 have close to double the production rate 

compared to the other radicals. It is interesting to note that the production of mchr2, mchr3, and mchr4 

increase as the initial temperature increases and the production of mchr1 and cychexch2 decrease to 

compensate. However, the change is small, no more than 2 percentage points for each radical. 

The most important second step is oxygen addition (i.e. formation of ROO) at all of the initial 

temperatures in this analysis. The importance of this reaction diminishes for each radical as the initial 

temperature increases due to the increasing importance of β-scission reactions. At 700 K, less than 0.05% 

of each of the fuel radicals is consumed via β-scission. Between 800 and 900 K, the percentages of 

mchr1, mchr2, mchr3, and mchr4 that are decomposed via β-scission increase by several thousand percent 

each; nevertheless, the absolute change is small and the consumption of these radicals still occurs mostly 

by oxygen addition. The mchr1, mchr3, and mchr4 radicals undergo scission of the cyclohexyl ring, 

whereas mchr2 primarily scissions at the methyl-cyclohexyl bond. This beta scission of mchr2 competes 

significantly with its consumption by O2 at 900 K. Furthermore, the increasing importance of the ring 

23 

 
opening reactions from 800 K to 900 K means that chain propagation pathways (instead of effective chain 

termination pathways forming methylcyclohexene and hydroperoxyl) are available, increasing the 

reactivity. Finally, even at the elevated initial temperature of 900 K, cychexch2 does not undergo 

significant ring opening. Instead, it will scission an H atom from site 1 or steal an oxygen atom from 

hydroperoxyl to form an alkoxy radical (RO) when it does not undergo oxygen addition (these pathways 

each only consume about 0.3% of cychexch2 and hence are not shown in Fig. 10). 

Figure 10: Path analysis of MCH combustion. Initial conditions are 25.5 bar and Mix #1 (ϕ=1.0) and 700 K (plain text), 
800 K (bold text), 900 K (italic text). Note that not all possible reaction pathways are shown for each species. 

24 

 
 
 
Returning to the low temperature pathways, there are four important classes of reactions that consume 

the ROO radicals in the current mechanism. These classes are: C1) internal H-atom transfer 

(isomerization) to form QOOH; C2) direct elimination of hydroperoxyl and methylcyclohexene; C3) H-

abstraction by ROO from either the fuel or hydroperoxyl to form ROOH; and, C4) reactions among the 

ROO radicals. Class C4 consumes less than ~5% of each of the ROO radicals at 700 K and less than 

~0.1% for the other temperatures and this class is therefore not shown on the path diagram in Fig. 10. Of 

the other three classes, C1 (formation of QOOH) is the predominant pathway in the low temperature 

ignition process. Nevertheless, the direct elimination of methylcyclohexene and hydroperoxyl and the 

formation of ROOH are important at low temperatures as well. 

For all of the temperatures considered here, a majority of the ROOH is formed by reactions of ROO 

with hydroperoxyl to give ROOH and an oxygen molecule. At the initial temperature of 700 K, 

approximately 15% of the fuel reacts to form ROOH, indicating its importance in low-temperature MCH 

combustion. The primary route of ROOH formation in this mechanism (H-abstraction from hydroperoxyl 

by ROO) has not been well studied at combustion relevant temperatures [41] and is therefore a good 

candidate for further investigation given its importance in the model for MCH combustion. 

As the temperature increases, the formation of ROOH becomes substantially less important while the 

direct HO2 elimination reaction becomes more important. The increase in production of 

methylcyclohexene and hydroperoxyl plays a role in the NTC region of ignition delay because this is 

effectively a chain terminating channel until the temperature increases enough that the sequence 

MCH+HO2=R+H2O2; H2O2(+M)=2OH(+M) becomes important and drives the overall ignition. 

Interestingly, for most of the ROO radicals, the change in the fraction of ROO consumed to form 

QOOH is non-monotonic as temperature increases. That is, for mch1oo, mch3oo, and mch4oo the 

production of QOOH increases in going from 700 K to 800 K, then decreases going from 800 K to 900 K 

due to the increasing importance of the HO2 elimination channel (due to nuances in the various reaction 

paths, mch2oo and chxch2oo do not follow this trend). Furthermore, the branching ratios in the 

decomposition of the QOOH species change as the temperature is increased (not shown in Fig. 10). At the 

25 

 
lowest temperature (700 K), the formation of hydroperoxyalkylperoxy radicals (OOQOOH) is favored, 

leading to low-temperature chain branching and the two-stage ignition phenomenon. However, at 800 K 

and 900 K, the QOOH tends to decompose into a heptenone and a hydroxyl radical, or one of three 

epoxide species. In the current model, both heptenone and the three epoxide species are represented by 

lumped heptenone and epoxide species; however, due to the apparent importance of these species in the 

intermediate temperature decomposition of MCH, further investigation of their pathways is warranted. 

5.2.  Sensitivity Analysis 

Our second type of analysis is a brute force, one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis. In this work, the sensitivity 

of the ignition delay to the reaction rates is considered. Due to the size of the mechanism, only the 

reactions of the fuel and the fuel radicals up to the OOQOOH species are considered. This approach is 

justified because many of the reactions of the C0-C4 base mechanism are known to be important to the 

ignition process (e.g., H2O2(+M)=2OH(+M)), but we are more interested in the effect of updates to the 

fuel specific sub-mechanism. The sensitivity index is defined in Eq. 1, 

𝑆𝑖 =

ln(𝜏𝑖,2/𝜏𝑖,1)
ln(𝑘𝑖,2/𝑘𝑖,1) 

Equation 1 

where 𝜏 is the ignition delay time, either first stage or overall, 𝑘 is the reaction rate, and subscript 𝑖 

indicates the reaction number. The numbered subscripts in Eq. 1 indicate the type of modification that has 

been made to the rate of reaction 𝑖 when computing the ignition delay, as discussed in the following. 

The reaction rates are modified by multiplying and dividing the pre-exponential constant by a factor 

𝑓. Thus, the forward and reverse rates are simultaneously modified. Special care is taken to properly 

modify reaction rates with pressure dependence and explicit reverse parameters. Each rate is modified 

sequentially and the ignition delay is computed; the pre-exponential constant is reset to its nominal value 

before modifying the next reaction. Finally, the nominal ignition delay with no rate modification is 

computed. Thus, each set of reactor input conditions requires 2𝑁 + 1 model evaluations, where 𝑁 is the 

26 

 
 
 
 
number of reactions considered in the sensitivity analysis and 𝑁 may be less than or equal to the total 

number of reactions. 

The 2𝑁 + 1 model evaluations result in 4𝑁 + 2 ignition delays if two-stage ignition is present and 

2𝑁 + 1 ignition delays otherwise. These ignition delays are used to compute the sensitivity indices 

according to Eq. 1. In the case of bidirectional sensitivity indices, the subscript 2 in Eq. 1 is associated 

with multiplication by 𝑓 and the subscript 1 is associated with division by 𝑓, resulting in 2𝑁 sensitivity 

indices if two-stage ignition is present and 𝑁 indices otherwise. In the case of unidirectional sensitivity 

indices, the subscript 2 is associated with either multiplication or division by 𝑓 and the subscript 1 is 

associated with the nominal ignition delay, 𝜏𝑖,1 = 𝜏1. For unidirectional sensitivity indices, 4𝑁 indices are 

obtained if two-stage ignition is present and 2𝑁 are obtained otherwise. 

In this work, the bidirectional sensitivity is used with 𝑓=10. For all of the reactions considered here, 

multiplying and dividing a given rate had opposite effects on the ignition delay. Thus, if the ignition delay 

increased (relative to the nominal case) when the rate of a certain reaction was multiplied, the ignition 

delay decreased (relative to the nominal case) when the rate of the same reaction was divided and vice 

versa. Since 𝑘𝑖,2 is greater than 𝑘𝑖,1 by definition, the sensitivity index 𝑆𝑖 will be positive if 𝜏𝑖,2 > 𝜏𝑖,1 (i.e. 

increasing the rate increases the ignition delay) and negative if 𝜏𝑖,2 < 𝜏𝑖,1 (i.e. increasing the rate 

decreases the ignition delay). The sensitivity analysis is run at the same conditions of the path analysis: 

CONV simulation, initial temperatures of 700 K, 800 K, and 900 K, initial pressure of 25.5 bar, and Mix 

#1. As with the path analysis, similar results are obtained for other pressures and mixtures.  

Figure 11 shows the sensitivity indices for the five reactions (among all the reactions considered in 

the present sensitivity analysis) to which the overall ignition delay is most sensitive for each temperature 

studied (700 K, 800 K, and 900 K). For the results at 700 K and 800 K, the bidirectional sensitivity of the 

first stage ignition delay to the same reactions is also shown, except for two reactions at 800 K for which 

the unidirectional sensitivity is plotted. The reasons for this will be discussed in due course. It should be 

noted that the sensitivity indices of the first stage ignition delay have a slightly different ranking than the 

27 

 
indices of the overall ignition delay. Therefore, the rank of the first stage sensitivity index of the reactions 

shown is given in parentheses next to the bar. At 700 K, the sensitivity of the overall ignition delay is in 

red and the sensitivity of the first stage ignition delay is in blue; at 800 K, the sensitivity of the overall 

ignition delay is in grey and the sensitivity of the first stage ignition delay is in green. The most sensitive 

reaction affecting the first stage ignition delay at 800 K is found to be MCH+OH=mchr3+H2O, although 

it is not listed in Fig. 11. At 900 K, there is no first stage ignition, and thus no sensitivity of the first stage 

ignition delay.  

Under the pressure/stoichiometry conditions of the present simulations, 800 K is approximately the 

highest initial temperature at which distinct two-stage ignition (i.e. two inflection points in the 

temperature or pressure trace) is found for MCH with the current mechanism. As such, several reactions 

affect the ignition strongly enough to eliminate the first inflection point. These reactions are given in 

Table 2 for either multiplication or division of the rate by the factor 𝑓=10. The naming convention of the 

species listed in Table 2 can be found in Fig. 10, Fig. 12, and the Supplementary Material. Two reactions 

shown in Table 2 also appear in Fig. 11, namely (𝑅1) mch2oo=mch2ene+ho2 and (𝑅2) 

mch2qx+o2=mch2qxqj. For these reactions at 800 K, the unidirectional sensitivity index is shown in Fig. 

11, where 𝜏𝑖,2 in Eq. 1 is found by division of the rate for 𝑖 = 𝑅1 and by multiplication of the rate for 𝑖 =

𝑅2. 

The role of the ROO=methylcyclohexene+HO2 reactions in the left column of Table 2 in eliminating 

the first stage of ignition is clear – this set of reactions diverts ROO radicals from entering the low-

temperature chain branching pathway via QOOH that leads to the two-stage ignition. Similarly, in the 

right column, decreasing the rate of the reaction of oxygen with QOOH to form OOQOOH reduces the 

rate of chain branching that leads to two-stage ignition. Concerning the reactions of the fuel with OH in 

the left column of Table 2, increasing these rates increases the formation of fuel radicals that are less 

reactive at low temperature than the cychexch2 and mchr2 radical. For example, the mchr2 radical adds to 

O2 and forms a peroxy radical (mch2oo) that has a fast RO2 isomerization path to QOOH involving the 

abstraction of an H atom from the methyl group. This RO2 isomerization is the path calculated and 

28 

 
discussed in Section 4.1. QOOH subsequently adds to O2 and leads to chain branching. The high 

reactivity of cychexch2 and mchr2 at low temperature is reflected by the high percentages at 800 K 

(>70%) leading to QOOH from cychexch2oo and mch2oo in Fig. 10.

(700 K, 800 K, and 900 K). At 700 K, the sensitivity of the overall ignition delay is in red and the sensitivity of the first 
stage ignition delay is in blue. At 800 K, the sensitivity of the overall ignition delay is in grey and the sensitivity of the first 
stage ignition delay is in green. At 900 K, the sensitivity of the overall ignition delay is in black. Numbers in parentheses 
represent the ranking of the first stage sensitivity indices.

mch + oh = mchr4 + h2o 
mch + oh = mchr3 + h2o 

In general, Fig. 11 shows that the ignition delay is sensitive to different sets of reactions at the three 

temperatures, although there is some overlap. The overlapping reactions confound simple 

recommendations for rate improvements. For instance, at 700 K, increasing the overall ignition delay will 

improve agreement with the experimental data, but at 800 K, the agreement is already quite good. 

Therefore, adjusting any of the rates to improve the agreement with the overall ignition delay at 700 K 

will probably make the agreement worse at 800 K. However, the first stage ignition delays at 700 K and 

800 K are both under-predicted; furthermore, two-stage ignition is predicted at temperatures for which the 

experimental ignition is single stage. It should therefore be possible to adjust several rate constants 

simultaneously to improve agreement with the first stage ignition delay and not deteriorate agreement 

with the overall ignition delay. To accomplish the simultaneous improvement of agreement of first stage 

and overall ignition delays, the rate constants of reactions that control the second stage ignition delay may 

also need to be adjusted (where second stage ignition delay is the difference between the overall ignition 

delay and the first stage ignition delay). 

Interestingly, the formation and destruction reactions of ROOH species do not appear in Fig. 11, 

despite their importance in the destruction of ROO radicals, particularly at 700 K (see Fig. 10). This may 

be due to the fact that formation of ROOH by reaction with HO2 followed by consumption of ROOH is a 

chain propagation path through the reactions ROO + HO2 = ROOH + O2; ROOH = RO + OH. In this 

sequence two radicals are formed (RO, OH) and two radicals are consumed (ROO, HO2). Thus, the 

formation of ROOH by reaction with HO2 and its subsequent destruction has a somewhat neutral effect on 

the radical pool. 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At 900 K, the overall ignition delay is particularly sensitive to reactions that form hydrogen peroxide, 

which decomposes to two hydroxyl radicals as the temperature increases during the induction period. 

Therefore, increasing the rate of formation of hydrogen peroxide will increase the formation of hydroxyl 

radical and decrease the overall ignition delay. At 900 K, the overall ignition delay is over-predicted, so to 

improve the results the overall ignition delay should be reduced (i.e. increasing the rates of reactions with 

negative sensitivity will improve the comparison). In addition, many of the reactions that are important at 

900 K are not important at 700 and 800 K, implying that changes made to the rates to improve the high-

temperature agreement will not significantly change the agreement at lower temperature. In particular, the 

MCH+HO2 rate constants have not been measured or calculated to our knowledge and are based on 

acyclic alkane rate constants [42]. They have uncertainties of at least a factor of 2 and as much as a factor 

of 10 based on the work of Aguilera-Iparraguirre et al. [42]. Increasing these rate constants would 

improve the agreement with the experimental ignition data at 900 K in the RCM and shock tube. 

Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations are needed for the fuel+HO2 reaction class to 

reduce this uncertainty in the rate constants. 

6.  Conclusion 

In this study, new experimental data are collected for methylcyclohexane autoignition in a heated rapid 

compression machine. Following the work of Mittal and Sung [16], three mixtures of MCH/O2/N2/Ar at 

equivalence ratios of 𝜙=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 are used and the ignition delays are measured at compressed 

pressure of 50 bar, for compressed temperatures in the range of 690–900 K. Two-stage ignition 

phenomena are reported for the stoichiometric and rich mixtures. However, substantial reactivity during 

the compression stroke limited the temperature range over which ignition delays could be reported, 

especially for the lean case. For these mixtures where the fuel concentration was kept constant, the order 

of reactivity, in terms of inverse overall ignition delay, is 𝜙=0.5> 𝜙=1.0> 𝜙=1.5. 

In addition, an existing model for the combustion of MCH developed by Pitz et al. [15] is updated 

with new reaction rates and pathways. The new model shows good agreement with the overall ignition 

31 

 
 
delays measured in this study, as well as the overall ignition delays measured in the studies of Mittal and 

Sung [16], Vasu et al. [9], and Vanderover and Oehlschlaeger [10]. However, the first stage ignition 

delays are uniformly under-predicted and in several cases, first stage ignition is predicted by the model 

where experimental ignition response shows no two-stage character. To help understand the fuel 

decomposition pathways and the reactions controlling the ignition, further analysis of the present 

mechanism is conducted. 

First, reaction path analysis is conducted for low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature ignition 

considered in this study. The results show that MCH primarily decomposes by H-abstraction reactions 

involving OH and HO2 radicals, followed by oxygen addition reactions. At low temperatures, the oxygen 

addition is followed by isomerization to QOOH species and second oxygen addition, leading to the low-

temperature chain branching characteristic of two-stage ignition. At intermediate temperatures, the 

elimination of methylcyclohexene and HO2 becomes competitive with the isomerization reaction, leading 

to the NTC region of the overall ignition delay. Finally, at high temperatures, HO2+MCH reactions form 

H2O2 and end the NTC region. 

Second, a brute force sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the reactions of the fuel and primary 

fuel radicals that control the ignition process. The overall and first stage ignition events at low and 

intermediate temperatures are primarily controlled by the initial reactions to form fuel radicals, especially 

H-abstraction by OH. At high temperatures, the controlling reactions are still the fuel radical formation 

reactions, but now the ignition process is controlled by H-abstraction by hydroperoxyl instead of 

hydroxyl. Combined, these analyses suggest that further investigation of several of the low-temperature 

fuel decomposition pathways is required and more accurate rate constants for fuel+HO2 reactions are 

needed.

Table 1. 

Figure 4: Comparison of experimental and simulated ignition delays for three pressures for Mix #1. 
The data at 15.1 and 25.5 bar are from the study of Mittal and Sung [16]. (a) First stage ignition 
delays (b) Overall ignition delays. 

Figure 5: Comparison of experimental and simulated ignition delays for three pressures for Mix #2. 
The data at 15.1 and 25.5 bar are from the study of Mittal and Sung [16]. (a) First stage ignition 
delays (b) Overall ignition delays. 

Figure 6: Comparison of experimental and simulated ignition delays for three pressures for Mix #3. 
The data at 15.1 and 25.5 bar are from the study of Mittal and Sung [16]. (a) First stage ignition 
delays (b) Overall ignition delays. 

Figure 7: Comparison of selected simulated and experimental pressure traces at 𝑷𝑪=50 bar for (a) 
Mix #1 (b) Mix #2 (c) Mix #3. Red lines indicate that the pressure profile of the reactive simulation 
deviates from the non-reactive case prior to EOC. Solid lines: experiment; dashed lines: reactive 
simulation; dot-dot-dashed lines: non-reactive simulation. 

Figure 8: Comparison of the present model with the experiments from Vasu et al. [9] and Vanderover 
and Oehlschlaeger [10] near 50 atm and for stoichiometric mixtures in O2/N2 air. 

Figure 9: Comparison of mechanism performance with the activation energy of Reaction Class 28, 
ketohydroperoxide decomposition, set at 41.6 kcal/mol (blue) and 39.0 kcal/mol (red). Experimental 
ignition delays are shown in green symbols. 

Figure 10: Path analysis of MCH combustion. Initial conditions are 25.5 bar and Mix #1 (ϕ=1.0) 
and 700 K (plain text), 800 K (bold text), 900 K (italic text). Note that not all possible reaction 
pathways are shown for each species. 

Figure 11: Sensitivity of the ignition delay to various reaction rates for Mix #1 (ϕ=1.0), 25.5 bar and 
three temperatures (700 K, 800 K, and 900 K). At 700 K, the sensitivity of the overall ignition delay 
is in red and the sensitivity of the first stage ignition delay is in blue. At 800 K, the sensitivity of the 
overall ignition delay is in grey and the sensitivity of the first stage ignition delay is in green. At 900 
K, the sensitivity of the overall ignition delay is in black. Numbers in parentheses represent the 
ranking of the first stage sensitivity indices.
