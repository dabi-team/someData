Abstract

We present analysis of the magnetic ﬁeld in seven solar ﬂare regions accom-
panied by the pulsations of hard X-ray (HXR) emission. These ﬂares were
studied by Kuznetsov et al. (2016) (Paper I), and chosen here because of
the availability of the vector magnetograms for their parent active regions
(ARs) obtained with the SDO/HMI data. In Paper I, based on the obser-
vations only, it was suggested that a magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) might play
an important role in the process of generation of the HXR pulsations. The
goal of the present paper is to test this hypothesis by using the extrapola-
tion of magnetic ﬁeld with the non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) method.
Having done this, we found that before each ﬂare indeed there was an MFR
elongated along and above a magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL) on the
photosphere. In two ﬂare regions the sources of the HXR pulsations were

located at the footpoints of diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld lines wrapping around
the central axis, and constituting an MFR by themselves. In ﬁve other ﬂares
the parent ﬁeld lines of the HXR pulsations were not a part of an MFR,
but surrounded it in the form of an arcade of magnetic loops. These results
show that, at least in the analyzed cases, the “single ﬂare loop” models do
not satisfy the observations and magnetic ﬁeld modeling, while are consistent
with the concept that the HXR pulsations are a consequence of successive
episodes of energy release and electron acceleration in diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux
tubes (loops) of a complex AR. An MFR could generate HXR pulsations by
triggering episodes of magnetic reconnection in diﬀerent loops in the course of
its non-uniform evolution along an MPIL. However, since three events stud-
ied here were conﬁned ﬂares, actual eruptions may not be required to trigger
sequential particle acceleration episodes in the magnetic systems containing
an MFR.

1. Introduction

The processes of energy release in solar ﬂares, especially in the impulsive
phase, usually are intermittent and non-stationary. This is well evidenced by
the presence of multiple peaks (bursts or pulsations) of diﬀerent amplitudes
and duration in the light curves of ﬂare electromagnetic radiation in a broad
range of wavelengths: from radio waves to hard X-rays (HXRs), and some-
times even up to gamma-rays (Dennis, 1988; Aschwanden, 2002; McAteer
et al., 2007; Kupriyanova et al., 2010; Nakariakov et al., 2010a; Sim˜oes et al.,
2015). Stellar ﬂares often show similar properties (e.g., see the discussion of
“complex” ﬂares in Davenport et al. (2014)).

Despite many years of studying of ﬂare quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP),
there is no full understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms yet
(Nakariakov et al., 2010b, 2016; Van Doorsselaere et al., 2016; McLaugh-
lin et al., 2018). In general, it is believed that the energy in solar ﬂares is
released by means of magnetic reconnection (Priest and Forbes, 2002; Shi-
bata and Magara, 2011). Most probably, ﬂare pulsations are also associated
someway to magnetic reconnection. There are two main groups of possible
models of long-period pulsations (P (cid:38) 1 s), which are the main subject of
the present work: (1) based on MHD waves and oscillations, including the
wave-driven reconnection; (2) based on the so-called “load/unload” mech-
anisms, i.e. spontaneous repetitive magnetic reconnection (Nakariakov and
Melnikov, 2009).

2

The ﬁrst group of models is more popular because of the direct link of the
observed quasi-periodicity with the periodicity of the wave processes, ubiq-
uity of MHD waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere, and their poten-
tial ability to inﬂuence all main aspects of the generation of electromagnetic
emission in ﬂare regions. In particular, MHD oscillations and waves can be
a quasi-periodic trigger/modulator of magnetic reconnection and can inﬂu-
ence dynamics of non-thermal particles and plasma in ﬂare loops. Moreover,
the MHD oscillations based models are attractive since they could help to
diagnose physical parameters of the ﬂaring site (such as plasma density and
magnetic ﬁeld), if there is conﬁdence in the correct choice of the model used
(e.g., Liu and Ofman, 2014; Nakariakov et al., 2016).

The “load/unload” mechanisms are mainly based on the possibility of the
repetitive regimes of energy release in the ﬂare sites through the “bursty”
magnetic reconnection (Kliem et al., 2000), associated with successive gen-
eration of multiple magnetic islands and their subsequent coalescence in an
extended quasi-vertical macroscopic current sheet generated in course of a
ﬂare development (Shibata and Tanuma, 2001; Drake et al., 2006a; Karlick´y
et al., 2010). There are also several other models belonging to this group and
based on diﬀerent ideas (see, Nakariakov and Melnikov (2009); Nakariakov
et al. (2016); Van Doorsselaere et al. (2016), as reviews on this issue).

Possibly, diﬀerent mechanisms can operate in diﬀerent ﬂares, due to the
wide variety of the physical processes included in the ﬂare physics, or diﬀerent
mechanisms can accompany one another in the same ﬂare region. Spatially-
resolved observations of sources of the ﬂare pulsations are important for
understanding their mechanisms, and for reliable identiﬁcation of the mod-
els used for their interpretation (e.g., Grigis and Benz, 2005; Zimovets and
Struminsky, 2009; Inglis and Dennis, 2012; Zimovets et al., 2013; Ning, 2014;
Li and Zhang, 2015; Dennis et al., 2017).

Recently, based on the systematic analysis of spatially-resolved obser-
vations made by RHESSI (Lin et al., 2002) it was shown that footpoint
(chromospheric) sources of HXR pulsations (with time diﬀerences between
successive HXR peaks within the range P ≈ 8 − 270 s) in all (29) ﬂares
studied are not stationary (anchored) in space — they demonstrate apparent
displacement in the parent active regions (ARs) from pulsation to pulsation
(Kuznetsov et al., 2016, hereafter referred to as Paper I). Based on these ob-
servations, it was concluded that the mechanism of ﬂare HXR pulsations (at
least with the characteristic time diﬀerences between the successive peaks
P in the considered range) is related to successive triggering of the ﬂare
energy release in diﬀerent magnetic loops of the parent ARs. The trigger-
ing mechanism was not directly identiﬁed in Paper I. Based on the fact that
more than 85% of the analyzed ﬂares were accompanied by coronal mass ejec-

3

tions (CMEs), i.e. were eruptive events, it was assumed that a non-uniformly
erupting magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) could act as a trigger of the ﬂare energy
release. Successive interaction of diﬀerent parts of the MFR with certain,
spatially separated loops of the parent active region could initiate episodes
of spatially-localized magnetic reconnection and acceleration of electrons,
and, as a result, could lead to apparent motion of the HXR sources and to a
series of the HXR pulsations. However, in Paper I the presence of an MFR
in the parent ARs before the ﬂares was just hypothesized, but it was not
conﬁrmed either by observations, or by extrapolation of the magnetic ﬁeld.
The goal of the present paper is to investigate the geometry (structure)
of the magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬂare regions studied in Paper I, based on the
reconstruction (extrapolation) of the magnetic ﬁeld in the non-linear force-
free ﬁeld (NLFFF) approximation (Wiegelmann and Sakurai, 2012). The ﬁrst
task is to verify whether MFRs were indeed presented in those ARs prior to
the ﬂare onset or not. It is known that an MFR can be present in an AR
before its eruption and the subsequent ﬂare, or an MFR can be formed from
a sheared arcade due to the magnetic reconnection (Priest and Forbes, 2002;
Schmieder et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017). We aim to check
which of these two possibilities were realized in the ARs studied. To the best
of our knowledge, such an analysis has not been performed systematically for
ﬂares with HXR pulsations. The second task is to analyze the spatial relation
of MFRs (if present) and the parent magnetic ﬁeld lines of the sources of the
HXR pulsations. This will help to corroborate the aforementioned hypothesis
on the important role of MFRs in generation of the ﬂare HXR pulsations.
Also, this will help to demonstrate explicitly that diﬀerent HXR pulsations
are emitted from diﬀerent parts of an MFR rather than from a “single”
oscillating loop as it is often assumed in some models of ﬂare pulsations
(e.g., Zaitsev and Stepanov, 2008; Kupriyanova et al., 2010; Chen et al.,
2016).

The paper is organized as follows. Selection and analysis (magnetic ﬁeld
extrapolation, visualization of the sources of HXR pulsations and magnetic
ﬁeld lines) of the ﬂare regions is described in Section 2. The main results
of the analysis are summarized and discussed in Section 3. Conclusions are
given in Section 4.

2. Data analysis

2.1. Selection of events

For the analysis we took the last seven solar ﬂares from the Paper I catalog
(No 23–29): SOL2011-02-15, SOL2011-06-07, SOL2011-09-06, SOL2014-04-
18, SOL2014-10-22, SOL2014-10-24, and SOL2014-11-09 (see Table 1). This

4

choice is determined by the fact that the parent ARs of these events were
observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.,
2012; Schou et al., 2012) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO), and the vector magnetograms are available for these ARs, which
is crucial for our study. We emphasize that this choice is determined only by
the availability of these data, and by the events selection criteria in Paper I.
No other additional (subjective) criteria are used. The light curves of solar
HXR emission detected by RHESSI during these ﬂares are shown in Figure 1.

2.2. Extrapolation of magnetic ﬁeld

For each of seven selected ARs we determined the pre-ﬂare coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld topology by adopting the non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF)
method developed by (Wheatland et al., 2000), and extended by (Wiegel-
mann, 2004) and (Wiegelmann and Inhester, 2010). A pre-processing pro-
cedure (Wiegelmann et al., 2006) was employed to remove most of the net
force and torque from the data, so that the boundary can be more consistent
with the force-free assumption. The NLFFF extrapolation used in our works
adopts the same free parameters as Case-E in (Wiegelmann et al., 2012).
As the boundary conditions, we used the Space-weather HMI Active Region
Patches (SHARPs) data product described by Bobra et al. (2014). This data
has a time step of 12 minutes, similar to the standard full-disk SDO/HMI
vector magnetograms. We chose the data for the instants of time before the
ﬂares, within 2 − 31 minutes prior to the ﬂare onset times according to the
GOES data (see Table 1 in Paper-I). It is known that the magnetic ﬁeld re-
constructed in the NLFF approximation usually does not change signiﬁcantly
on a time scale of a few tens of minutes (e.g., Guo et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
2016b; Guo et al., 2017). The selected regions have a rectangular shape in
the helioprojective-cartesian (HPC) coordinates (Thompson, 2006). Their
angular sizes range from 160 to 300 arcseconds along the X axis, and from
128 to 256 arcseconds along the Y axis, to include all the main sources of
the magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬂare area studied. For the extrapolation in six out
of all seven events, we binned the data to ≈ 1.0(cid:48)(cid:48) per pixel, except for the
SOL2014-11-09 event, for which we kept the original pixel size of the HMI
magnetograms of ≈ 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48). This was done to decrease computational time,
though without signiﬁcant loss of quality.

The calculations were performed in rectangular Cartesian coordinates,
neglecting the sphericity of the photosphere. The inaccuracies associated
with this approach are acceptable (see Gary and Hagyard, 1990), since the
regions of interest selected for the magnetic ﬁeld reconstruction were chosen
small enough. Moreover, we are only interested in the central sections of
the selected regions, where the studied ﬂares occurred. The magnetic ﬁeld

5

near the edges, where larger errors are accumulated, is not of interest for this
study. Almost all analyzed ARs are located near the center of the solar disk
(see Table 1 in Paper I). Only for the SOL2011-06-07 ﬂare that happened at
the helio-longitude of ≈ 50◦, the expected inaccuracies are quite high (≈ 4−6
grid points) and should be taken into account.

In Table 1 we show the parameters used in the estimation of the quality of
the non-linear force-free ﬁeld reconstruction for the investigated ﬂare regions.
The parameters L1 and L2 are the measures of force- and divergence-freeness,
respectively; the (j, B)-angle is the angle between electric current density and
magnetic ﬁeld vectors averaged over a studied region; and Enlf f /Epot is the
ratio of non-linear force-free and potential ﬁeld energies in a studied region
(Wiegelmann et al., 2012). The values of L1 and L2 are less than 2 for
all the ﬂares studied, indicating reasonable (relying on the experience of the
previous tests) force- and divergence-freeness of the reconstructed ﬁelds. This
is also conﬁrmed by the low values (< 10◦) of the (j, B)-angle. The values of
Enlf f /Epot are larger than 1 for all events that also indicates the adequacy
of the magnetic reconstruction done.

2.3. Visualization of the HXR sources and magnetic ﬁeld lines

To visualize the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld and to compare its structure
(geometry) with the location of the sources of the HXR pulsations in each
event we implemented the following procedure:

1. First, we converted the HPC coordinates of the HXR sources to the
Stonyhurst heliographic (HG) coordinates using the SolarSoft WCS
routines (Thompson, 2006).

2. Second, using the formula for the solar diﬀerential rotation derived by
Howard et al. (1990), we rotated the HXR sources to the times of the
used pre-ﬂare magnetograms to compensate for the time diﬀerences
between the diﬀerent data sets. The HXR sources were reconstructed
with the use of the RHESSI data and the CLEAN image synthesis
algorithm (Hurford et al., 2002) for almost the same time intervals,
i.e. for the same HXR (25 − 50 keV) pulsations, as in Paper I. For
most of the time intervals (corresponding to the HXR pulsations) we
used data of all nine RHESSI detectors and the image pixel size is 1(cid:48)(cid:48).
3. Third, suggesting that the synthesized HXR sources (25 − 50 keV) of
the HXR pulsations are located, as usual (Aschwanden et al., 2002),
in the chromospheric footpoints of the ﬂare magnetic ﬂux tubes (ﬁeld
lines), we found the pixels of the magnetograms (the coordinates of
which were also pre-transformed into the HG system) corresponding to
the brightest pixels of the HXR sources (i.e. its brightness maxima).

6

These pixels are used as the starting points for the reconstruction of
magnetic ﬁeld lines in the ﬂaring regions. They are shown by the small
colored circles in Figures 2–4. Diﬀerent colors of the circles (and the
ﬁeld lines started from them) correspond to diﬀerent time intervals,
i.e. diﬀerent HXR pulsations (see Figure 1; almost the same colors
were used in Paper I). The ﬁeld lines are started from the heights of
HHXR ≈ 0.7 − 2.2 Mm above the photosphere to satisfy our aforemen-
tioned assumption that the studied HXR sources are located in the
chromosphere.

4. The radial component of the magnetic ﬁeld on the photosphere, the
reconstructed magnetic ﬁeld lines and the corresponding HXR sources
of the HXR pulsations (their centers of maximum brightness) are rep-
resented in Figures 2–3 built using the ParaView application1. The
positions of the centers of the HXR sources are also shown in Fig-
ure 4 without the reconstructed ﬁeld lines for better clarity. Since
the HXR sources are located low in the chromosphere at a height
of only HHXR < 2.2 Mm, as indicated above, the projection eﬀect
(∆max < HHXR×tan 50◦ ≈ 2.6 Mm) of superimposing the HXR sources
on the photospheric magnetic maps can be neglected.

In addition to the magnetic ﬁeld lines started from the HXR sources, we

also constructed two other sets of ﬁeld lines:

(1) For all ARs studied, except the SOL2011-02-15 and SOL2014-10-24
events (see below), we tried to ﬁnd localized elongated bundles of heli-
cal ﬁeld lines twisted (more than once) around the common central axis.
Such bundles of ﬁeld lines can be considered as an approximation of an
MFR (Gibson et al., 2006; Filippov et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2017; Guo
et al., 2017). Looking ahead, we note here that we found such bundles
of ﬁeld lines in the central part of all seven considered ﬂare regions.
They are shown by the thick light gray ﬁeld lines (tubes) and also
marked by the thick arrows (white or red) in Figures 2–3. We did not
try specially to ﬁnd (and visualize) MFRs for the SOL2011-02-15 and
SOL2014-10-24 events, since the reconstructed ﬁeld lines started from
the HXR sources represent such elongated twisted magnetic structure
by themselves (see Figure 2(a) and Figure 3(c), where an MFR is indi-
cated also by the thick red arrow), i.e. they are diﬀerent components
(threads) of an MFR.

(2) We also reconstructed multiple magnetic ﬁeld lines started from the

main (strongest) magnetic sources (the sunspots’ umbras and penum-
bras) on the photosphere in the ARs studied. This is just to identify
better the general magnetic structure of the ARs. These ﬁeld lines are
shown by the thin black and white curves in Figures 2–3.

3. Summary of the results and discussion

Here we summarize and discuss the main results of the performed anal-
ysis of seven ﬂares studied. We remind that these ﬂares were taken from
Paper I (Kuznetsov et al., 2016) for the follow-up investigation. They were
accompanied by sequences of HXR bursts (pulsations). These ﬂares were se-
lected from Paper I because they all occurred in the “SDO’s epoch”, i.e. the
photospheric vector magnetograms are available for their parent ARs for the
times just before their onset. This allowed us to make extrapolation of mag-
netic ﬁeld in these ARs in the NLFFF approximation, and to investigate its
structure in relation to the sources of the HXR pulsations.

Based on the performed extrapolation, ﬁrst, we found that there is a
spatially localized bundle of magnetic ﬁeld lines twisted around their common
axis (some of them — slightly more than once), and elongated mainly along
an MPIL in the core of the parent AR before each ﬂare studied (see Figures 2–
3). Such bundles of the intertwined ﬁeld lines can be considered as a reliable
signature of the presence of an MFR (e.g., Schrijver, 2009; Schmieder et al.,
2013; Liu et al., 2016b; Cheng et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017, and references
therein) in these ARs. Second, it can be seen clearly in Figures 2–3 that
the sources of diﬀerent HXR pulsations are located in footpoints of diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁeld lines. Deﬁnitely, diﬀerent HXR pulsations are emitted from
diﬀerent ﬂux tubes (loops) rather than from a single ﬂare loop in those events.
Both these ﬁndings are consistent with conclusions made in Paper I (see also
Introduction).

3.1. Two cases of diﬀerent magnetic geometry

It is interesting to note that in two out of seven events (namely, SOL2011-
02-15 and SOL2014-10-24) the reconstructed magnetic ﬁeld lines initiated
from the sources of the HXR pulsations form a twisted MFR (shown by the
thick red arrow in Figures 2(a), 3(c)) by themselves. These ﬁeld lines are a
part of an MFR — they are some of its individual ﬁbers (or threads). We
will call this as case A.

However, in the remaining ﬁve events (SOL2011-06-07, SOL2011-09-06,
SOL2014-04-18, SOL2014-10-22 and SOL2014-11-09) the ﬁeld lines recon-
structed from the HXR sources are not directly a part of an MFR situated
in a parent AR (shown by the thick arrow in Figures 2(b,c), 3(a,b,d)). These

8

ﬁeld lines are located around an MFR in the form of an overlying arcade of
magnetic loops. We will call this situation as case B.

Here it should be noted that the conclusion about whether the ﬁeld lines
are part of an MFR or not is rather subjective. This is illustrated by the
SOL2014-11-09 event (Figure 3(d)), in which the parent ﬁeld lines of the
HXR pulsations entangle the MFR quite tightly, without a signiﬁcant gap,
as, say, in the SOL2014-04-18 (Figure 3(a)) and SOL2014-10-22 (Figure 3(b))
events. This may indicate that there is no fundamental diﬀerence between
the events of cases A and B, and the energy release processes may be similar
in both cases.

3.2. Interpretation of the eruptive events

Four of the studied events (SOL2011-02-15, SOL2011-06-07, SOL2011-
09-06, and SOL2014-04-18) were deﬁnitely accompanied by eruptions and
CMEs, i.e. they can be classiﬁed as the eruptive events. Studies of various
aspects of these eruptive events can be found in the multiple papers (e.g.,
Schrijver et al. (2011); Janvier et al. (2014) for SOL2011-02-15; Cheng et al.
(2012); Inglis and Gilbert (2013); Kuznetsov et al. (2017) for SOL2011-06-
07; Jiang et al. (2014); Janvier et al. (2016) for SOL2011-09-06; Cheng et al.
(2015); Brosius and Daw (2015); Carley et al. (2016) for SOL2014-04-18).

The “standard” 3D solar ﬂare model is applicable for their interpreta-
tion (Shibata and Magara, 2011; Janvier et al., 2015).
In this case, the
HXR pulsations can be a result of successive episodes of magnetic reconnec-
tion, acceleration of electrons and their precipitation along diﬀerent magnetic
ﬂux tubes (loops) of a magnetic arcade non-uniformly (along its longitudinal
axis or an MPIL) stretched by an erupting MFR (see, e.g., discussions in
Grigis and Benz, 2005; Liu et al., 2010).
In particular, the “zipping-like”
or “whipping-like” asymmetric MFR eruption (Liu et al., 2009) could ex-
plain the apparent motion of the HXR sources along the MPIL observed in
the impulsive phase of the ﬂares studied (see Table 4 in Paper I). In this
discussion we do not address the question of what determines the speed of
the HXR source progression along the solar surface in this scenario, which
should be a subject of a dedicated theoretical modeling. The absence of vis-
ible HXR sources in the footpoints of some overlying ﬁeld lines, surrounding
an erupting MFR, may be due to the lower eﬃciency of magnetic reconnec-
tion and electron acceleration in these ﬂux tubes, and insuﬃcient sensitivity
and dynamic range of RHESSI.

In
On the other hand, we cannot totally rule out other possibilities.
particular, it is not excluded that successive episodes of magnetic reconnec-
tion and particle acceleration (consequently, HXR pulsations) may occur in
the interaction regions of an MFR’s outer shells with diﬀerent surrounding

9

magnetic loops. From Figure 2(b,c) and Figure 3(a) it can be seen that the
orientation of the MFR’s ﬁeld lines (thick light gray) is diﬀerent from the
orientation of the surrounding ﬁeld lines hosting the sources of the HXR
pulsations (color). Such diﬀerent orientation of the interacting magnetic ﬂux
tubes is a favorable condition for the initiation of magnetic reconnection (e.g.,
Sakai and de Jager, 1996; Linton et al., 2001). Further observations and mod-
eling are required to conﬁrm or disprove this scenario (see also Netzel et al.,
2012; Hassanin and Kliem, 2016).

It should be noted that eruption of MFRs is a dynamical phenomenon,
and the magnetic structure of ARs changes during eruption and associated
ﬂares because of magnetic reconnection. However, we believe that the ex-
trapolated pre-ﬂare magnetic ﬁeld lines approximate the general magnetic
structure of the ARs studied quite realistically and reliably. The pre-eruptive
(pre-ﬂare) magnetic structure determines the general dynamics of the follow-
ing eruption, the energy release processes and the ﬂare emission sources (e.g.,
Guo et al., 2017; Amari et al., 2018). This has been demonstrated in numer-
ous previous works, including interpretation of the appearance and location
of ﬂare ribbons and HXR sources (see, e.g., Gorbachev et al., 1988; Demoulin
et al., 1994; Somov et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2010; Den and Zimovets, 2014;
Janvier et al., 2014; Inoue et al., 2016; Janvier et al., 2016). Apparently, the
spatial dynamics of the HXR sources in eruptive events is determined by the
development of an erupting MFR. However, the magnetostatic approach can
still be used for our study for the following reason. As we see from the ob-
servations, episodes of reconnection happened successively in diﬀerent loops
at diﬀerent times. This means that at each speciﬁc time (i.e. , during spe-
ciﬁc HXR peak), the magnetic ﬁeld changed its topology only locally, in the
vicinity of some speciﬁc ﬁeld lines, while no other drastic changes occurred
in other ﬁeld lines of the parent AR at that time. Our analysis only roughly
shows at which ﬁeld lines the energy release could occur during the ﬂares. In
this study, we do not attempt to explain in details the observed dynamical
behavior of the HXR sources, i.e. to explain the exact reason of appearance
of the HXR sources in the speciﬁc places in speciﬁc times, and the ordering
of this appearance. We only demonstrate that the sources of diﬀerent HXR
pulsations appeared at footpoints of diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld lines, which are
not a part of the same magnetic loop.

The discussed concept of generation of HXR (and other wavebands) pul-
sations does not, in general, require the presence of MHD waves and oscilla-
tions, as it is often assumed (see Introduction). In this concept, pulsations
are just a result of a triggering of energy release and acceleration of par-
ticles in certain diﬀerent magnetic elements (ﬂux tubes) that are somehow
diﬀerent from the neighboring magnetic ﬂux tubes, due to non-uniform, es-

10

sentially 3D, evolution of an MFR in highly inhomogeneous medium of par-
ent ARs, consisting of multitude of magnetoplasma elements with diﬀerent
physical parameters. Diﬀerent mechanisms can accelerate particles during
such eruption of an MFR (Aschwanden, 2002; Zharkova et al., 2011). One
of the most promising mechanisms is related to the multiple coalescence of
magnetic islands formed beneath an erupting MFR as a result of the fast
magnetic reconnection (Drake et al., 2006a; Guidoni et al., 2016). Numeri-
cal simulations show that such process can be “bursty” and “patchy” (e.g.,
Kliem et al., 2000; Drake et al., 2006b; B´arta et al., 2011). This may explain
why ﬂare pulsations sometimes have a rather random character than show
quasi-periodic behavior (e.g., Gruber et al. (2011); Inglis et al. (2015, 2016),
and Paper I).

3.3. Interpretation of the non-eruptive or conﬁned events

Three of the studied events (SOL2014-10-22, SOL2014-10-24, and SOL2014-

11-09) were not accompanied by perceptible eruptions and CMEs (see, e.g.,
Chen et al. (2015); Sun et al. (2015b); Thalmann et al. (2015); Liu et al.
(2016a) for SOL2014-10-22 and SOL2014-10-24; Paper I and Li et al. (2016)
for SOL2014-11-09). Thus, these ﬂares can be classiﬁed as the non-eruptive
events. Since these events were located near the center of the solar disk, the
possibility remains that the slight (non-detectable) rise of the MFR could
still occur at the initial stage of the development of these events, but due to
some reasons did not develop into a full eruption and CME (see Inoue et al.
(2016); Amari et al. (2018) for the modeling of the SOL2014-10-24 event and
discussions in the papers cited above). In this case, these events can be con-
sidered as the conﬁned ﬂares (such term is used, e.g., by Chen et al. (2015);
Thalmann et al. (2015)).

If a slight rise of the MFR indeed occurred in these events (in particular,
the onset of the kink instability of the MFR in the SOL2014-10-24 event
is shown by Amari et al. (2018)), it could be accompanied by formation
of a current sheet beneath the rising MFR (e.g., Forbes, 1990; Chen and
Shibata, 2000). In such case, the interpretation of the non-uniform energy
release processes along the MPIL can be almost the same as in the case of
the “standard” 3D eruptive ﬂares discussed in the previous sub-section. For
instance, the “zipping-like” asymmetric rise of the MFR is possible, which
could result in the propagation of the reconnection front along the current
sheet (i.e. , along the MPIL) and successive episodes of energy release in
diﬀerent ﬂux tubes. Similar eﬀect is also expected in frames of the models
considering some types of instabilities of a current sheet extended along the
MPIL (Artemyev and Zimovets, 2012; Ledentsov and Somov, 2016). Another
possibility is to trigger multiple episodes of magnetic reconnection in diﬀerent

11

parts of a current sheet by the propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves
as discussed by Nakariakov and Zimovets (2011).
It is worth mentioning
that a current sheet can be also created in the outer shells of a rising MFR
during its interaction with the overlying magnetic arcade (e.g., Hassanin and
Kliem, 2016). The aforementioned processes of initiation of the non-uniform
reconnection could be also happen in such helical current sheet, and this may
explain some of the case B events.

However, it is not excluded that there was no rise of the MFR at all in
these events. To interpret the observations in such a situation, it is possi-
ble to use the model of the 3D “zipper reconnection” developed recently by
Priest and Longcope (2017). This model is designed for two diﬀerent mag-
netic conﬁgurations: (1) with and (2) without a pre-existing MFR under a
sheared magnetic arcade. The pre-existence of an MFR is not necessary, it
can be formed during a ﬂare due to magnetic reconnection. Since we found
the MFRs in the ﬂare regions studied, they rather correspond to the model
magnetic conﬁguration (1). The eruption of an MFR is not necessary (al-
though it is possible in this model). It can be held by, e.g., the magnetic
tension of the overlying loops (Priest, 2014; Myers et al., 2015). The recon-
nection in this model occurs non-simultaneously along the entire arcade, but
successively between some pairs of nearby loops, in the sequence of multiple
individual reconnection episodes, called “simple zippets”. Starting at one
pair of loops, e.g. due to initial resistive instability, this process can spread
along the MPIL. If the pre-ﬂare magnetic ﬁeld is not uniformly distributed
along the MPIL (what we actually observe), the reconnection process will
be discrete and the observed ﬂare radiative emission will also be inhomoge-
neous in time and space. This is manifested, in particular, by the sequential
appearance of the HXR sources in diﬀerent places along the MPIL and by a
sequence of the observed HXR pulsations.

The energy release processes and formation of the X-shaped ﬂare ribbons
in the SOL2014-11-09 conﬁned ﬂare was discussed by Li et al. (2016) based on
the magnetic ﬁeld reconstruction and the concept of the 3D reconnection at
a separator. However, the HXR pulsations were not discussed in that paper.
The “zipping reconnection” concept could be incorporated in the proposed
model to interpret the dynamics of the HXR sources.

3.4. On the lack of connectivity of the HXR sources

One can see from Figures 2, 3 that there is an apparent lack of connectivity
of the HXR sources of the same colors, i.e. the footpoints of the ﬁeld lines
are mainly associated with only one HXR source, and not to the conjugated
source (of the same color) appeared at a given time. This may indicate that
the NLFFF extrapolations are not entirely reconstructing the real magnetic

12

ﬁeld or that one of the HXR sources at a given time is too weak compared
to the other. The RHESSIs dynamic range is about 10, and so it may have
missed the conjugated sources.

There is another possibility, how one can explain the lack of connectivity
of the HXR sources appeared on opposite sides of the MPIL at a given time.
The magnetic extrapolations were done based on the pre-ﬂare magnetograms.
During a ﬂare, the connectivity of magnetic ﬁeld lines could (and should)
change because of the magnetic reconnection (e.g., Sun et al., 2015a; Wang
et al., 2016; Xue et al., 2016; Hernandez-Perez et al., 2017). In this situation,
paired HXR sources appeared simultaneously could not be connected by
a ﬁeld line reconstructed from a pre-ﬂare magnetogram. Moreover, HXR
sources on diﬀerent sides of an MPIL do not have to be connected by the
same ﬁeld line at all, since electrons generating these HXR sources may be
accelerated and injected into diﬀerent ﬁeld lines, even in the case of a common
initial region of energy release and acceleration. Any real acceleration region
has a ﬁnite size, while a ﬁeld line is an abstraction having a zero radius of
cross-section.

3.5. Possible interpretation of the quasi-periodicity

Possible interpretation of the quasi-periodicity of the HXR pulsations
within the non-MHD-wave concept was given in Paper I. In the simplest
case, this requires the constancy of an MFR speed (v ≈ const) and the
presence of spatial inhomogeneity in the physical parameters of surrounding
magnetic arcades, with a characteristic spatial scale (l ≈ const) along the
direction of the MFR motion. In such case, the quasi-period of pulsations
can be determined simply as P ≈ (cid:104)P (cid:105) ≈ l/v ≈ const. However, this in-
terpretation has some shortcomings too. First, it is unclear why an MFR
should move at a constant speed along the MPIL. Second, the nature of the
spatial modulation of the inhomogeneous surrounding magnetic structures is
also not obvious. There is a possibility that a quasi-periodic modulation may
exist along an MFR itself, say, due to some oscillations/waves in it — similar
to prominence oscillations (e.g., Oliver and Ballester, 2002; Oliver, 2009).
This hypotheses, however, requires further study, and is beyond the scope
of the present work, which will be addressed elsewhere.
In addition, the
spatial quasi-periodicity could, in particular, result from some instabilities
of a reconnecting macroscopic current sheet (e.g., Artemyev and Zimovets,
2012; Ledentsov and Somov, 2016) created during an MFR rise, or from the
corrugation instability of a coronal arcade recently described by Klimushkin
et al. (2017).

In the non-eruptive ﬂares, when the MFR is at rest, in order to explain
the quasi-periodicity of the HXR pulsations in the frames of the 3D “zipper

13

reconnection” (Priest and Longcope, 2017), it is also necessary to suggest a
spatial inhomogeneity in the magnetic arcade and a constancy of the speed
of the reconnection trigger movement along the MPIL. What is a trigger
and why it should have approximately constant speed (usually below the
sound and Alfv´en speeds in the corona; see, e.g., Paper I) is not yet clear.
In addition, the detected variation of the HXR emission could be somehow
linked with the vertical oscillations of an emerging MFR detected by (Kim
et al., 2014), which would modulate the local inﬂow rate in the reconnection.
However, theoretical modeling of this eﬀect is still absent.

We would like to note also that the discussed concept does not reject
the possibility that other physical processes, in particular, related to MHD
waves and oscillations, may also act in ﬂare regions and cause quasi-periodic
component of pulsations in some cases. In any case, our ﬁndings indicate
an important role of a pre-ﬂare magnetic structure (in particular, an MFR),
which is more complex than a “single” loop, and the three-dimensional char-
acter of the development of energy release in such magnetic structure, in the
time variability of the ﬂaring emission. This is what we originally wanted to
show by this work.

3.6. Geometrical characteristics of the found MFRs

Geometrical characteristics of the found MFRs (the length of its central
axis, LMFR, and height of its top above the photosphere, HMFR) are sum-
marized in Table 2. These characteristics were estimated roughly by visual
analysis of the reconstructed magnetic ﬁeld lines using the ParaView applica-
tion. By an MFR we mean a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines bounded in space and
winding coherently on some imaginary axis stretched along the MPIL. We
realize the diﬃculty to determine an MFR’s boundaries just by visual inspec-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. However, there is no need for a more accurate
evaluation of these parameters in this study. In Table 2 we also present the
number (np) of signiﬁcant HXR (25 − 50 keV) pulsations together with the
average time diﬀerences ((cid:104)P (cid:105)) between the peaks of successive pulsations,
taken from Table 2 of Paper I. The linear Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (cc)
and p-value calculated for the pairs of the corresponding physical variables
are shown in the right bottom corners of each panel on Figure 5. All calcu-
lated p-values are not close to zero. This indicates that correlation between
the pairs of the physical variables cannot be considered as signiﬁcant. Due to
this reason, we refrain from discussing possible causes of weak correlations of
the physical characteristics of the MFRs and HXR pulsations. Data statis-
tics are insuﬃcient (and have to be extended in future works) to draw any
physical conclusions.

14

The last two columns of Table 2 contain information about the group
(see Paper I) and case (see sub-section 3.1) of each event. We recall here
that the group 1 ﬂares show systematic displacement of the HXR sources
from pulsation to pulsation with respect to a MPIL, which has a simple
extended trace on the photosphere, and the group 2 ﬂares show more chaotic
displacements of the HXR sources with respect to a MPIL having a more
complicated structure. One can see from Table 2 that there is no consistency
between these two diﬀerent classiﬁcations of the ﬂare regions studied. This
indicates that the magnetostatic approach used in this work, probably, is
not enough to describe all details of the spatio-temporal evolution of the
ﬂare energy release processes. This requires more advanced modeling taking
dynamics of a ﬂare region into account.

4. Conclusion

By means of magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation in the NLFFF approximation
we investigated the magnetic geometry and structure of seven solar ﬂare re-
gions accompanied by HXR pulsations. These ﬂares were chosen from the
catalog in Paper I on the basis of the availability of vector magnetograms for
their parent ARs, obtained with the SDO/HMI data. We found that there
is an MFR elongated along an MPIL in the core of each AR studied, before
each ﬂare.
In two ﬂare regions the sources of the HXR pulsations are lo-
cated at the footpoints of diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld lines which are constituent
parts of the MFR. In ﬁve remaining ﬂare regions the parent ﬁeld lines of the
HXR pulsations are not a part of the MFR, but surround it in the form of
an arcade of magnetic loops. These results support the concept discussed
in Paper I, namely that the HXR pulsations are a consequence of succes-
sive episodes of energy release in diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux tubes (threads) of
a complex AR, possibly triggered by non-uniform evolution (full or conﬁned
eruption) of an MFR. This concept is consistent with the “standard” 3D
model of solar ﬂares and does not require the presence of MHD waves and
oscillations in ﬂare regions for interpreting the HXR (as well as other wave-
bands) pulsations. In the absence of eruption, some other mechanisms, such
as the 3D “zipper reconnection” may lead to the non-uniform energy release
in a sheared magnetic arcade with an underlying MFR. However, details of
the time variability produced by these mechanisms that can be attributed
to the “magnetic dripping” class of QPP models (Nakariakov et al., 2010b),
require further investigation.

Figure 1: Normalized (to the maximum) four-second RHESSI corrected count rates in the
25 − 50 keV (solid curves) and 50 − 100 keV (dotted curves) energy channels, for seven
solar ﬂares studied. The color horizontal segments at the top mark the time intervals of
diﬀerent HXR pulsations for which the HXR images were synthesized and positions of the
HXR sources were found for the further analysis. These time intervals (and corresponding
colors) almost coincide with the time intervals (and corresponding colors) determined in
Paper I. Spatial positions of the centers of maximum brightness of these HXR sources are
used as the starting points in the chromosphere for the reconstruction of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines shown in Figures 2–3 by appropriate colors. These maximum brightness centers
of the HXR sources are also shown in Figure 4.

Figure 2: Reconstructed magnetic ﬁeld lines in the regions of the 15-Feb-2011 (a), 07-Jun-
2011 (b) and 06-Sep-2011 (c) solar ﬂares accompanied by the HXR (25–50 keV) pulsations
(see Figure 1). The top view is on the left, the side view is on the right. Colors of the ﬁeld
lines correspond to the colors of the sources of the HXR pulsations (see Figure 1; the spatial
locations of these HXR sources are also shown in Paper I). The HXR sources (i.e. the
positions of their brightness maxima) are shown here by small circles of the appropriate
colors (see also Figure 4). The twisted bundles of the thick light gray ﬁeld lines represent
a magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) found in the core of these ﬂare regions. The MFR is also
indicated by the thick white arrow. The red arrow indicates the MFR composed of the ﬁeld
lines (colored) reconstructed from the sources of the HXR pulsations. Thin gray ﬁeld lines
are background magnetic ﬁeld lines started from the strongest nearby magnetic sources.
The background images are the maps of the radial magnetic ﬁeld component (Br) on the
photosphere made with the pre-ﬂare SDO/HMI magnetograms (SHARPs). The colorbars
show values of Br for the corresponding colors. The thin white dashed quadrangles left
and right on the photosphere are shown just to indicate the regions of interest and to give
the reference helioprojective cartesian coordinates (HPC) of its corners (in arcseconds).
The same regions are also shown in Figure 1.

sources of the HXR pulsations in the regions of the 18-Apr-2014 (a), 22-Oct-2014 (b),
24-Oct-2014 (c) and 09-Nov-2014 (d) solar ﬂares accompanied by the HXR pulsations.
The same notations as in Figure 2. See also Figure 1 for the colors notation of the HXR
peaks.

tions overlaid on the maps of the radial magnetic ﬁeld component (Br) on the photosphere
made with the pre-ﬂare SDO/HMI magnetograms for the studied ﬂare regions. The re-
gions shown here correspond to the regions of interest shown by the thin white dashed
quadrangles in Figures 2 and 3. The centers of the HXR sources and their colors corre-
spond to those ones shown in Figures 2 and 3 (see also Figure 1 for the colors notation of
the corresponding HXR peaks).
