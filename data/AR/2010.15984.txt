Precision spectroscopy of atomic systems1 is an invaluable tool for the advancement of our 

understanding of fundamental interactions and symmetries2. Recently, highly charged ions (HCI) 

have been proposed for sensitive tests of physics beyond the Standard Model2‚Äì5 and as candidates for 

high-accuracy atomic clocks3,5. However, the implementation of these ideas has been hindered by the 

parts-per-million level spectroscopic accuracies achieved to date6‚Äì8. Here, we cool a trapped HCI to 

the lowest reported temperatures, and introduce coherent laser spectroscopy on HCI with an eight 

orders of magnitude leap in precision. We probe the forbidden optical transition in 40Ar13+ at 441 nm 

using quantum-logic spectroscopy9,10 and measure both its excited-state lifetime and g-factor. Our 

work ultimately unlocks the potential of HCI, a large, ubiquitous atomic class, for quantum 

information processing, novel frequency standards, and highly sensitive tests of fundamental physics, 

such as searching for dark matter candidates11 or violations of fundamental symmetries2. 

Alike a microscope aimed at the quantum world, laser spectroscopy pursues ever higher resolving power. 

Every increase in resolution enables deeper insights into the subtle effects that all known fundamental 

interactions have on the atomic wave function. Advances in optical frequency metrology have dramatically 

improved resolution in the last three decades1, and are making laser spectroscopy an extremely sensitive tool 

for studying open physics questions such as the nature of dark matter, the strength of parity violation, or a 

possible violation of Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity2. However, only a few atomic and ionic species are 

currently within the reach of cutting-edge optical frequency metrology. Expanding this field of exploration 

to systems with high sensitivity to such effects is therefore crucial. Due to their extreme properties, highly 

charged ions (HCI) are promising candidates for such fundamental tests. Contributions from special 

 
 
relativity, quantum electrodynamics (QED), and the nucleus to the binding energies of their outer electrons 

become several orders of magnitude larger than in neutral atoms. This renders them ideal systems for 

benchmarking the most advanced theories and calculations, which has been repeatedly demonstrated via 

optical fluorescence spectroscopy in electron beam ion traps (EBIT)6,7, x-ray spectroscopy in storage rings12 

and EBITs13‚Äì15, and ground-state g-factor studies in Penning traps16,17. The hyperfine spitting of the 1s state 

in heavy hydrogen-like ions can even shift into the optical range, providing laser-accessible transitions (see, 

e.g., 18‚Äì20) with nuclear size contributions on the order of several percent of the total transition energy. 

It was realised recently that a non-gravitational coupling of dark matter to ordinary matter would affect 

atomic energy levels11, and thus become observable in optical clock comparisons as an apparent drift or 

modulation of the fine-structure constant ÔÅ°. HCI offer narrow-linewidth optical transitions that are among 

the most sensitive to a possible variation of ÔÅ°4. In addition, their inherent insensitivity to external electric 

fields3 leads to significantly smaller systematic perturbations compared to neutral and singly charged atoms. 

This makes them potentially superior references for high-accuracy optical atomic clocks, with many 

proposed species reviewed in reference 5. However, so far, no experiment has been capable of performing 

laser spectroscopy at the required level of precision. The major limitation was set by the high temperature of 

a few million kelvins at which HCI are produced and typically stored. This induces Doppler broadenings 

with full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) linewidths of several tens of gigahertz, and corresponding line-

centre uncertainties of a few hundreds of megahertz in the best cases6‚Äì8. Since HCI generally do not offer 

suitable transitions for direct laser cooling, sympathetic cooling of multiple HCI by laser-cooled 9Be+ ions 

was implemented in a Penning trap at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory21, reaching an ion 

temperature of around 4 K. More recently, the Cryogenic Paul Trap Experiment (CryPTEx)22 demonstrated 

reliable Coulomb crystallization of single 40Ar13+ ions in a crystal of many 9Be+ ions. Sympathetic Doppler 

cooling down to the 10 mK level and two-ion crystal preparation23,24 paved the way for high-accuracy 

spectroscopy. Even so, spectroscopy of narrow transitions in single ions requires efficient state detection on 

a different, fast cycling transition1, typically also used for laser cooling. If such a transition is not available, 

quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) can be employed9,10. There, the ‚Äòspectroscopy ion‚Äô (in this case the HCI) 

is co-trapped with a so-called ‚Äòlogic ion‚Äô (9Be+) that provides sympathetic cooling, state preparation, and is 

used for state detection. These functions are enabled by means of the Coulomb interaction between both 

ions, allowing lasers to couple their internal electronic levels with their quantised joint motion in the trap. 

This technique and variations thereof have been successfully employed for optical atomic clocks based on 

Al+ ions25‚Äì27, for internal state detection and spectroscopy of molecular ions28,29, and for spectroscopy of 

broad transitions in atomic ions30,31. 

Here, we demonstrate for the first time QLS of an HCI, specifically of the electric dipole-forbidden 

transition between the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 fine-structure levels of 40Ar13+ at a wavelength of 441 nm, the most 

accurately known transition in any HCI. We achieve a FWHM well below 100 Hz, close to the natural 

linewidth of 17 Hz. Single line scans taken on a time scale of a few minutes determine the line centre with 

an uncertainty below 2 Hz. This corresponds to a fractional statistical uncertainty of 3√ó10-15 for the 

transition frequency of approximately 680 THz and compares favourably to previous measurements taken 

over hours or even days to achieve 2√ó10-7 relative uncertainties6‚Äì8. Quantum logic-assisted state preparation 

of the 40Ar13+ ion allows us to measure all six Zeeman components of the transition, which split up on a 

megahertz scale in the 160 ¬µT magnetic quantisation field. This allows us to determine the g-factor of the 

2P3/2 excited state with unprecedented accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate a quantum logic-assisted 

excited-state lifetime measurement. 

Preparation of a single highly charged ion 

A detailed description of the experimental setup is given in Methods (see also Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). 

In brief, argon HCI are produced by an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), PTB-EBIT32, and ejected from it in 

triggered bunches of ~200 ns duration with a mean kinetic energy of approximately 700 qV, where q is the 

ion charge. The HCI are guided to the spectroscopy trap through an ion-optical beamline. Based on their 

time-of-flight, we select the 40Ar13+ ions by rapidly switching a gate electrode. A pulsed gradient potential 

decelerates them electrodynamically33 to about 146 qV. Then, a single 40Ar13+ ion stochastically enters the 

cryogenic linear Paul trap34. The trap is globally biased to +138 V, thereby slowing the HCI down to 8 qV 

upon entry. After passing through the trapping region, the HCI is reflected back by an electrode at the end of 

the Paul trap. A mirror electrode in front of the trap is switched up to prevent the ion from escaping again, 

thereby capturing the HCI in an oscillatory axial motion. The repeated crossing through a pre-prepared laser-

cooled 9Be+ Coulomb crystal within the trap dissipates the HCI‚Äôs residual kinetic energy. After sufficient 

sympathetic cooling, the 40Ar13+ ion joins the Coulomb crystal. Excess 9Be+ ions are deliberately removed 

until a two-ion crystal has been prepared (see Fig. 1). The entire two-ion crystal preparation procedure takes 

only a few minutes. The Paul trap is refrigerated to below 5 K by a mechanically decoupled, closed-cycle 

cryostat to provide a vacuum below the 10-12 Pa level (corresponding to a particle density < 20000/cm3), 

thus suppressing charge-exchange collisions and achieving HCI storage times on the order of 45 minutes35.  

Ground-state cooling and quantum logic 

The implementation of QLS requires control and preparation of the motional and internal states of both ions 

using coherent laser pulses on carrier and sideband transitions. After the two-ion crystal preparation, the 

strong Coulomb coupling between the two ions results in joint motional modes within the trap. Sympathetic 

cooling, state preparation and QLS are performed by repeating the experimental sequence shown in Fig. 2. 

First, Doppler cooling and optical pumping on the 9Be+ 2S1/2-2P3/2 cycling transition (see Fig. 2a) are applied. 

The two axial normal modes of the Coulomb crystal with secular frequencies of about ÔÅÆIP = 1.37 MHz (in-

phase) and ÔÅÆOP = 1.86 MHz (out-of-phase) respectively, are then cooled to the quantum mechanical ground 

state of motion with final average occupation numbers of ùëõ = 0.05 (IP) and 0.02 (OP), corresponding to an 

effective temperature of less than 50 ¬µK for each mode. For this purpose, we use laser pulses which 

coherently couple the electronic degrees of freedom to the common motional modes (a technique referred to 

as resolved sideband cooling). To do this, stimulated Raman transitions are driven between the 9Be+ 

hyperfine qubit states |‚Üì‚ü©L|n‚ü©m ‚Üí |‚Üë‚ü©L|n ‚àí 1‚ü©m (where |n‚ü©m denotes the motional quantum state of the IP or OP 

modes) using two laser beams with a wavelength of 313 nm. In our low magnetic field, the states are 

separated by a frequency of approximately 1.25 GHz. A repumping laser couples the 9Be+ 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 

levels (not shown in Fig. 2a) for electronic state preparation and for depopulation of state |‚Üë‚ü©L 36. The Ar13+ 

Zeeman ground state is then deterministically prepared with clock laser sideband pulses (see Extended Data 

Fig. 3). After full state preparation, QLS9 is performed in four steps (see Fig. 2): A clock laser pulse of 

tuneable length and power is applied (1), which couples the ground and excited state in Ar13+ coherently. 

After a variable wait time for excited-state lifetime measurements, a clock laser red sideband ÔÅ∞-pulse maps 

the excitation from the electronic Ar13+ state onto the common axial OP mode (2) and another red sideband 

ÔÅ∞-pulse on the 9Be+ hyperfine qubit transition maps it onto the 9Be+ electronic state (3). Finally, the qubit 

state of 9Be+ [dark (|‚Üë‚ü©L) or bright (|‚Üì‚ü©L)] is detected with up to 98 % fidelity by counting the fluorescence 

photons it scatters from the Doppler cooling laser within 200 ¬µs (4). A threshold value discriminates 

between both states. The sequence is carried out multiple times (~100) within a few seconds with a fixed set 

of parameters to average the quantum projection noise and evaluate a mean excitation probability. To 

resolve linewidths approaching the natural linewidth of 17 Hz, a narrow-linewidth clock laser is required. 

Our home-built laser system is composed of a commercial extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) at 882 nm, 

prestabilised with a high locking bandwidth of 4 MHz to a passive external reference cavity using the ECDL 

pump current and grating piezo as actuators for the feedback. Thereby, we suppress laser high-frequency 

noise and obtain an instantaneous linewidth of about 2 kHz, limited by the relatively low cavity finesse (of 

about 1000) and lack of vibration-insensitive design. To suppress the residual noise, the laser is then further 

stabilised by phase-locking it to an ultra-stable laser operating at a wavelength of 1.5 ¬µm. The latter is itself 

stabilised to a cryogenic cavity made from crystalline silicon (referred to as Si2)37. It achieves at averaging 

times between 1 and 50 seconds a fractional frequency instability at the thermal noise limit of the cavity of 

4√ó10-17. Using a femtosecond optical frequency comb as a transfer oscillator, we generate a virtual beatnote 

between the two lasers38. By demodulating it, we register their relative frequency and phase fluctuations, 

which are dominated by the significantly higher noise level of the 882 nm prestabilisation cavity. The 

demodulated beatnote is used to generate a feedback signal for phase-locking the two lasers, which is 

applied to an acousto-optic modulator between the ECDL and the prestabilisation cavity. The significantly 

lower bandwidth of the second locking stage ensures that the two loops do not compete with one another, 

but drifts and noise on the prestabilisation cavity out to the kHz-level are suppressed at the ECDL output, 

from which the spectroscopy light is derived. This suppresses the residual noise of the 882 nm clock laser, 

narrows its linewidth, and reduces the daily drift to a ~10 Hz level, dictated by Si2. The laser is frequency 

doubled to 441 nm in an external enhancement cavity containing a periodically-poled potassium titanyl 

phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. Active power stabilisation on a pulse-by-pulse basis at the ion trap was 

implemented for the clock, Doppler cooling, and Raman lasers to achieve stable system parameters such as 

Rabi frequencies and ac Stark shifts. 

Coherent laser spectroscopy of 40Ar13+ 

Applying this technique, we carried out the first coherent laser spectroscopy of an HCI. Fig. 3a shows the 

excitation profile of the m1/2 = ‚àí1/2 to m3/2 = ‚àí3/2 Zeeman component of the 40Ar13+ 2P1/2-2P3/2 fine-structure 

transition.  The blue curve shows a fit to the line by a Rabi line shape as expected for the top-hat laser pulse 

of 12 ms duration. This pulse length results in a 65 Hz FWHM Fourier-limited linewidth. We do not observe 

any additional line broadenings on this first-order Zeeman sensitive transition at this level, which confirms 

our previous measurements of a magnetic field stability of better than 1 nT34 achieved via active stabilisation 

of the field in the vicinity of the vacuum chamber. Additionally, alternating external magnetic fields are 

shielded by the highly conductive cryogenic thermal shields made of high-purity copper with a low-pass 

corner frequency of ‚â§ 0.3 Hz and 30 to 40 dB suppression in the frequency range of 60 Hz to 1 kHz34. The 

maximum fringe contrast of about 0.4 at this probe duration was mostly limited by the excited-state lifetime, 

with contributions due to the approximately 90 % fidelity of the sideband operations on the two ions, 

imperfect state preparation and detection. Frequency scans with longer probe times can in principle resolve 

the natural linewidth, albeit at reduced excitation probability. Fig. 3b shows the on-resonance excitation 

probability as a function of the probe time for a higher intensity of the clock laser. Under continuous 

illumination, Rabi flopping between the two electronic states is observed (fitted by the red curve). The 

coherence decays with the known excited-state lifetime of 9.573(4) ms39, indicated by the red-shaded 

exponential envelope of the fit. This measurement confirms coherence beyond this timescale for both the 

clock laser and the magnetic field. We also performed a direct measurement of the excited-state lifetime. For 

this, a carrier ÔÅ∞-pulse (step (1) in Fig. 2) was applied with maximum laser intensity, which populated the 

40Ar13+ excited state in about 16 ¬µs. After a variable wait time, the full transfer sequence was performed, and 

the remaining 40Ar13+ excited-state fraction was mapped onto the 9Be+ qubit state (see also Methods). During 

the wait time, a series of ground-state-cooling pulses on both axial motional modes was applied every 

millisecond to keep the two-ion crystal in the motional ground state in the presence of anomalous heating of 

12 and 29 phonons per second for the OP and IP modes respectively. By incrementing the wait time in 1 ms 

steps, an axial mode temperature independent of the wait time is ensured. The observed exponential 

spontaneous decay of the excited state is shown in Fig. 3c and results in a lifetime of 9.97(26) ms. This is 

~1.5 standard deviations longer than the more accurate experimental result of 9.573(4)stat (

from an in-EBIT measurement39 and advanced calculations of 9.538(2) ms40 and 9.5354(20) ms41. The 

deviation from the previous measurement and calculations is consistent within the uncertainty. Further 

details are discussed in Methods. 

Measurement of the excited-state g-factor 

A magnetic field of about 160 ¬µT is applied at the location of the ions to define a quantisation axis and to 

deliberately split the Zeeman substates of 9Be+ and 40Ar13+ on a megahertz scale. With quantum logic-

assisted HCI state preparation (see Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3), all six Zeeman components of the 

40Ar13+ 2P1/2-2P3/2 transition can be coherently excited, as shown in Fig. 4a. The bottom x-axis represents the 

clock laser detuning from the degenerate line centre while the top x-axes represent the relative detunings 

from the centres of the individual Zeeman components. We can reconstruct the Zeeman shifts of the 2P3/2 

substates from this data (see Fig. 4b and c, as well as Methods), and derive the ratio of the g-factors of the 

excited and ground states from the measured frequencies. Within our current experimental precision of a few 

hertz over a splitting of several megahertz, we do not observe any quadratic contribution, which for instance 

could arise from electric field gradients coupling to the electric quadrupole moment of the 2P3/2 state, or 

from a quadratic Zeeman shift. A quadratic term added to the fit function of Fig. 4b is consistent with zero. 

Recently, the ground-state g-factor g1/2 of 40Ar13+ was measured in the Penning trap experiment 

ALPHATRAP by the continuous Stern-Gerlach method to parts-per-billion accuracy17. Using this value, we 

obtain a weighted average of g3/2 = 1.3322895(13)stat(56)syst from three individual measurements (see Fig. 5). 

This is an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over previous in-EBIT measurements7, 

revealing for the first time the contributions to an HCI excited-state g-factor which arise from special 

relativity, interelectronic interactions, and QED. It also settles a discrepancy between previous theoretical 

values42‚Äì46, confirming the configuration-interaction calculations of refs. 42,45,46 and very recent coupled-

cluster calculations47. 

Conclusions 

We have cooled HCI to the ground state of motion in a linear Paul trap, making them the coldest HCI ever 

prepared in a laboratory. This enabled us to perform the first coherent, optical-clock-like laser spectroscopy 

of an electric dipole-forbidden optical transition in an HCI using quantum logic, at a level of precision that is 

eight orders of magnitude higher than the previous state-of-the-art. This proves the feasibility of hertz-level 

optical spectroscopy of HCI and opens up this large class of atomic systems to the tools of cutting-edge 

frequency metrology and quantum information processing. 

The determination of the absolute frequency of the 40Ar13+ fine-structure transition with a fractional 

uncertainty of 3√ó10-15 and even higher levels of precision requires further evaluation of systematic shifts, 

such as the small time dilation shift from the residual motion of the ion48 or the electric quadrupole shift49, 

which is typically suppressed in HCI. By restricting measurements to the points of maximum frequency 

sensitivity of each line, frequency information can be obtained faster than when scanning the full line 

profiles as demonstrated here, further reducing the statistical uncertainty at a given averaging time50. At the 

same time, averaging over the Zeeman components on the second rather than minute timescale will suppress 

systematic uncertainties arising from drifting magnetic fields51. 

The presented techniques are not limited to our proof-of-principle HCI, 40Ar13+, but can be applied more 

generally to forbidden transitions in other HCI. Several of the candidate species have properties that are 

even better suited for optical clock experiments, including much longer excited-state lifetimes and 

suppressed systematic shifts. Certain HCI are particularly sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model 

such as a possible variation of the fine-structure constant4, or to effects arising from fundamental 

interactions. A wide field of applications is the systematic study along isoelectronic sequences of relativistic 

effects in bound electronic systems and bound-state QED at ultra-high precision5. 

Furthermore, the techniques we have demonstrated here are not limited to the optical domain ‚Äì this work 

also unlocks the new frontier of the vacuum ultraviolet and x-ray regimes for ultra-high precision 

spectroscopy, regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are incompatible with neutral and singly-charged 

atoms due to unavoidable photoionisation. This will enable novel high-accuracy atomic clocks based on HCI 

and unrivalled tests of fundamental physics. 

Note: During the revision of the manuscript a complementary work demonstrating incoherent laser 

spectroscopy of 40Ar13+ in a Penning trap was published52.

METHODS 

Highly charged ion production, transfer and recapture. We show a top view of the laboratory setup in 

Extended Data Fig. 1, and a simplified schematic of the potential landscape in Extended Data Fig. 2a. 

Highly charged ions (HCI) are produced by electron impact ionisation and stored by PTB-EBIT, a 

Heidelberg-type compact electron beam ion trap (EBIT)32. After extraction of ions in bunches, a beamline 

with multiple electrostatic elements is used to guide them towards the Paul trap and to manipulate their 

kinetic energy distribution. Five segmented einzel lenses53 and an electrostatic double-focusing 90¬∞ 

deflector54 are employed for focusing and steering. A pair of pulsed drift tubes (following the approach 

described in ref. 33) is used for deceleration and pre-cooling, reducing the phase-space volume of the 

bunches. Downstream, two microchannel plate (MCP) detectors can be moved into the ion beam in front of 

and behind the Paul trap to optimise ion yield and beam transmission. The first one also features a retarding 

 
 
field analyser used for determining the mean kinetic energy and the energy spread of the ion bunches. While 

the present method of HCI production, transfer, and recapture combining EBIT, beamline, and Paul trap can 

handle a large variety of elements and charge states, the following section refers specifically to the present 

case of optimised 40Ar13+ recapture.  

Highly charged argon ions are produced in a distribution of charge states by means of a 13 mA, 1 keV 

electron beam in an approximately 50-V-deep axial trapping potential of the EBIT. In each cycle, the central 

trap electrode is rapidly switched from about 450 V (for the aforementioned 50-V-deep trap) to a repulsive 

extraction potential of 700 V (200 V higher than the outer trap electrode potential) for a period of 200 ns at a 

rate of 4 Hz to eject the ions. The kinetic energy relative to the ground potential of the beamline (0 V) and 

thus the velocity of extracted ions depend on the total extraction potential of 700 V as well as on the ionic 

charge q, allowing a separation of the different charge states by their different time-of-flights (Extended 

Data Fig. 2a and b). 40Ar13+ is selected with the help of an electrode of the third segmented einzel lens just 

behind the 90¬∞ deflector. This electrode acts as a gate by rapidly switching it to a passing voltage at the 

40Ar13+ arrival time and back to a deflecting voltage after the ion passage. Thus, the trajectories of all other 

charge states are deflected away from the Paul trap. We measured a mean kinetic energy of 694 qV with 

respect to ground for the fast 40Ar13+ bunches by means of the retarding field analyser (Extended Data 

Fig. 2e). An associated axial energy spread of 32 qV was also determined. To decrease the mean kinetic 

energy and its spread to values more amenable for trapping and efficient cooling in the cryogenic Paul trap, 

we perform an electrodynamic deceleration step with the pair of pulsed drift tubes. By biasing them to 

approximately 510 V and 590 V respectively before the extraction, a linear axial potential gradient is 

generated on the beamline axis between the two electrodes. When the ion bunch arrives at that position 

about 9.7 ¬µs after ion ejection, it is thus exposed to a mean potential of 550 V. Then, both drift tube 

potentials are rapidly grounded using a fast high-voltage switch. This slows down the ion bunch to a kinetic 

energy of 146 qV and reduces the axial energy spread to 13 qV (Extended Data Fig. 2f). The deceleration 

step also significantly shortens the length of the ion bunches from about 5.2 cm to about 1.7 cm full-width-

at-half-maximum (FWHM), while their temporal width is only slightly reduced (Extended Data Fig. 2c and 

d). After passing through a final einzel lens and an unbiased mirror tube, the 40Ar13+ ions enter the Paul trap. 

Its voltages are commonly biased to 138 V to accomplish the final electrostatic deceleration step. This 

brings the ions to a residual kinetic energy of about 5 to 10 qV. 

The Paul trap is formed by a radially confining radio-frequency (rf) potential and an axially confining dc 

potential. Once inside the trap, the HCI repeatedly pass through a cigar-shaped Coulomb crystal of about 50 

to 100 9Be+ ions that has been previously loaded into the Paul trap by means of laser ablation combined with 

photoionisation34 (see also Fig. 1). This proceeds as follows. During injection into the Paul trap, owing to 

their relatively high kinetic energy, most HCI can overcome the weak axially confining potential of 

300 meV (above the biased ground of 138 V) applied to the electrostatic endcap at the entrance of the trap. 

After passing through the 9Be+ Coulomb crystal for the first time, the 40Ar13+ ions are reflected by the 

opposite electrostatic endcap potential of about 12 V (above the biased ground of 138 V). In the meantime 

(17.1 ¬µs after initial ion extraction from the EBIT), the mirror tube at the entrance of the Paul trap is rapidly 

switched up to a confining axial electrostatic potential to complete the capture of 40Ar13+. Then the trap 

remains closed for 1.9 s, during which the HCI can dissipate their residual kinetic energy by repeated 

interactions with the laser-cooled 9Be+ ions. If these steps are successful for an 40Ar13+ ion, it joins the 9Be+ 

Coulomb crystal (Fig. 1). Otherwise, the mirror-tube potential is lowered again to let the next HCI bunch 

enter the Paul trap. This whole recapture process is rather efficient and succeeds on average in less than 30 s. 

Excited-state lifetime measurement. The data for the lifetime measurement include 440 measurements, 

each of which with 100 experimental realisations, adding up to a total measurement time of about two hours. 

Eleven measurements were averaged for every single waiting time, with the error bars in Fig. 3c indicating 

the quantum projection noise of 1100 experimental implementations. In order to cancel the effects of 

parameter drifts on the observed signal, the waiting time was scanned in a pseudo-random sequence.  

Drifts of the atomic resonance frequencies could lead to systematic variations in the detected excitation 

probabilities. The shortest achievable ÔÅ∞-times of 16 ¬µs for the initial HCI excitation and 225 ¬µs for the HCI 

sideband transition lead to an interaction-broadening of the respective lines of 62 kHz and 4.4 kHz, 

respectively. Our typical short-term magnetic field fluctuations lead to line shifts on the < 10 Hz level, and 

thus affect the measured excited-state population on the order of 10-4. The axial trap frequency has 

fluctuations below 100 Hz over the course of a day. The distribution of data points for a given wait time is 

consistent with the expected quantum projection noise, thereby ruling out systematic drifts at the level of the 

statistical uncertainty. 

The clock laser pulses are generated by the first diffraction order of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). 

Despite the typical 100 dB level of extinction of the rf drive power provided by an active rf switch, the 

optical extinction ratio does not reach this level due to scattered light within the AOM crystal. However, this 

leaked light is unshifted by the AOM and therefore detuned from the ion resonance by the rf drive frequency 

of about 200 MHz, or 107 natural linewidths. This alone reduces the de-excitation probability by 

approximately 14 orders of magnitude. 

Spontaneous decay of the HCI on the red sideband is suppressed by the square of the Lamb-Dicke 

parameter, ÔÅ®2 ‚âà 0.01. However, residual decay on this sideband leads to heating of the motional mode and 

may thus appear as spurious excitation in the quantum logic detection. A few sideband cooling pulses 

applied just before the quantum logic transfer pulse suppress this effect by returning the crystal to its ground 

state. Off-resonant depumping of the excited state of 40Ar13+ by the 9Be+ lasers is negligible due to the 

narrow natural linewidth and the large detuning. Collisional de-shelving as discussed in refs. 55,56 is absent in 

this experiment due to the extreme high vacuum. Furthermore, collisions of an HCI with a neutral particle 

likely lead to charge exchange and total, but inconsequential ion loss. 

g-factor evaluation. The 40Ar13+ 2P3/2 excited-state g-factor, denoted as g3/2, is determined by a linear fit of 

the Zeeman substate energy shifts. We use the well-known ground-state g-factor of the clock transition from 

a recent high-accuracy measurement17 to operate a co-magnetometer and measure the magnetic field by an 

appropriate combination of the Zeeman components. 

The energy shifts ‚àÜùê∏3/2,ùëö3/2,ùëñ = ùëö3/2,ùëñ ùëî3/2ùúáùêµùêµ of the Zeeman substates of the excited 2P3/2 state due to an 

external magnetic field B are obtained from the measured Zeeman shifts fi (in units of frequency) of the six 

Zeeman components  (i ranging from 1 to 6 according to Fig. 4c) and analogously the shifts Œîùê∏1/2,ùëö1/2,ùëñ of 

the 2P1/2 Zeeman substates. h and ¬µB are the Planck constant and the Bohr magneton, respectively. The shifts 

are referenced with respect to the degenerate line/level centres. One then obtains:

B is eliminated from the above equation by using the four inner Zeeman components 2-5, which are less 

sensitive to magnetic field fluctuations than the two outer ones. Components f2, f3 share the common excited 

state m3/2 = ‚àí1/2 (see Fig. 4c), and therefore their difference directly yields the ground-state Zeeman 

splitting without relying on the excited-state g-factor. With the known ground-state g-factor, g1/2 from the 

work of Arapoglou et al.17, we obtain the magnetic field 

ùêµ1 =  

‚Ñé (ùëì3 ‚àí ùëì2)
ùëî1/2 ùúáùêµ

. 

(3) 

Similarly, components f4, f5 share the excited state with m3/2 = +1/2 and we acquire a second measurement of 

ùêµ2 =  

‚Ñé (ùëì5 ‚àí ùëì4)
ùëî1/2 ùúáùêµ

. 

(4) 

Introducing U = f5 ‚Äì f4 + f3 ‚àíf2 for simplicity, we average the magnetic field B from these two relations to 

reduce the uncertainty: 

ùêµ =

ùêµ1 + ùêµ2

On the right-hand side of the equal sign of this equation, the measured shifts of the excited Zeeman substates 

are given and fulfill a linear relation in m3/2,i (left-hand side of the equation). A linear fit (see black line in 

Fig. 4b) of the form

with offset b to account for a global frequency offset in the measured fi allows us to determine the excited-

state g-factor g3/2 from the slope a:

(8) 

The uncertainties ùúéùë¶ùëñ of the excited Zeeman substates are obtained from the right-hand side of Eq. (6) by 

expressing U again through U = f5 ‚Äì f4 + f3 ‚àíf2, followed by standard uncertainty propagation with the 

independently measured fi:

(9) 

The uncertainties ùúéùëìùëñ of the Zeeman components depend on the statistical uncertainty of the line centre from 

the fit, ùúéùëìùëñ,ùëìùëñùë° (fitting the lines by Rabi line shapes), and the relative systematic magnetic field uncertainty 

ÔÅ≥B/B. The latter is time-dependent and is estimated from the observed magnetic field stability previously 

measured by using the 9Be+ qubit transition frequency (see reference 28 for details) to be 4.1√ó10-6 

(measurement 1) and 3.2√ó10-6 (measurements 2 and 3) on relevant time scales. Accordingly, one has: 

ùúéùëìùëñ = ‚àöùúéùëìùëñ,ùëìùëñùë°

The linear fit shown in Fig. 4b is weighted with the ùúéùë¶ùëñ uncertainties, which are displayed in the lower panel. 

For completeness, we state the fit offsets of b = ‚àí17(3) Hz, ‚àí45(2) Hz, and ‚àí30(2) Hz for the three sets of 

measurements. The reduced ÔÅ£2 of the linear fits are 1.45, 0.57, and 0.21.  

To estimate the uncertainty of g3/2, we replace a and U in Eq. (8) by their analytical expressions. ùëé =

, obtained from the closed-form solution of a linear fit. The yi are given by the right-

hand side of Eq. (6), and U = f5 ‚Äì f4 + f3 ‚àíf2. We can neglect the parts-per-billion uncertainty of the 

experimental result g1/2 = 0.66364845532(93) from the very recent Penning trap measurement17, since it is 

more than three orders of magnitude smaller than our experimental uncertainties in the 25000 times weaker 

magnetic field. Finally, the only uncertainties are introduced by the independently measured fi. Thus, the 

uncertainty ùúéùëî3/2 is obtained from the common formula of uncertainty propagation 

ùúéùëî3/2 = ‚àö‚àë (

The evaluated g3/2 values are 1.3322989(19)stat(56)syst, 1.3322897(23)stat(43)syst, and 1.3322828(24)stat(43)syst 

from the three measurement sets obtained on two different days, where we have stated the statistical and 

systematic uncertainties separately. The results are shown in Fig. 5 together with recent calculations. The 

uncertainties of the individual measurements are the root of the sum of the squared statistical and systematic 

uncertainties. The measurements agree within their uncertainties, where the largest deviation between 

 
 
measurement 1 and the weighted average is 1.6 standard deviations. We obtain the weighted average g3/2 = 

1.3322895(13)stat(56)syst, where we have combined the statistical uncertainties and stated the largest 

systematic uncertainty of the individual measurements as a conservative estimate for the systematic 

uncertainty of the average.

drift tubes for deceleration, and six cylindrical electrodes arranged in line in front of and behind the Paul trap. Charge-

state separation is accomplished by the different time-of-flights through the beamline. One electrode of the third 

segmented einzel lens is used as a gate to select the desired charge state. A microchannel plate (MCP) detector in front 

of the Paul trap includes two fine stainless-steel meshes to apply a well-defined retarding field and allows a 

measurement of the kinetic energy distribution of the ion bunches (see also Extended Data Fig. 2e and f). A second 

MCP detector behind the Paul trap is used to optimize the ion beam transmission through the Paul trap. b, Magnified 

side view of the cryogenic Paul trap region. The trap (photograph) is shown with the two adjacent electrostatic tubes. 

The left one (mirror tube) at the entrance of the Paul trap is used to capture the HCI by rapidly switching it to a 

confining potential once the HCI have passed it. 

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Highly charged ion extraction and transfer. a, Simplified illustration of the electrostatic 

potential for the 40Ar13+ transfer from the electron beam ion trap (EBIT) to the Paul trap. The entire ion inventory 

stored in the EBIT, with its charge-state distribution displayed as gray-shaded, is ejected by switching the axial trap to 

a repulsive potential. The charge states separate due to their distinct initial kinetic energy. 40Ar13+ ions (red) are 

selected by an electrode used as a gate (not shown). The fast 40Ar13+ bunch is then slowed down upon entering the 

pulsed drift tubes. Having arrived there at the centre of a linear potential gradient, the electrode potentials are rapidly 

switched to ground, and a slower 40Ar13+ bunch leaves the pulsed drift tubes. At the Paul trap, the ions are further 

 
decelerated by an electrostatic potential and enter the trapping region with a reduced residual kinetic energy of 5 to 10 

qV. They then pass a Coulomb crystal of 9Be+ ions and are reflected by an electrostatic endcap electrode biased to a 

potential of about 12 V above the biased common ground. Meanwhile, an electrostatic mirror tube in front of the Paul 

trap has been switched up to a confining potential at which 40Ar13+ is unable to escape the Paul trap. This causes an 

oscillatory motion along the trap axis. Through the repeated interactions with the laser-cooled 9Be+ ions, 40Ar13+ 

dissipates its residual kinetic energy and joins the Coulomb crystal. b, Normalised ion yield as a function of the time-

of-flight after ion ejection from the EBIT, measured by the first microchannel plate (MCP) detector in front of the 

Paul trap. The black curve shows the entire charge state distribution, with Ar charge states from +7 through +15. 

Using the gate electrode, 40Ar13+ is chosen for passage, as shown by the red curve. c, Normalised fast 40Ar13+ bunch as 

a function of time (FWHM of about 250 ns) and position along the beamline axis (averaged over 16 shots) and, d, for 

a normalised slow 40Ar13+ bunch (FWHM of about 185 ns). e, Normalised kinetic energy distribution of the fast 40Ar13+ 

bunch along the beamline axis and, f, of the slow bunch after deceleration and phase-space cooling using the pulsed 

drift tubes. The red circles show the integrated ion yield of an averaged 40Ar13+ bunch (16 shots) for a given retardation 

potential, measured by the retarding-field analyser. A Gaussian error function (red line) was fitted to the data and 

differentiated to obtain the Gaussian energy distribution (blue line) to show the mean kinetic energy and longitudinal 

energy spread. 

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Quantum logic-assisted internal state preparation of Ar13+. The m1/2 = ‚àí1/2 state of the 

2P1/2 level is deterministically populated by a series of five clock laser sideband ÔÅ∞-pulses (1. through 5.), which excite 

the two-ion crystal from the motional ground state |0‚ü©m (solid lines) into the excited state |1‚ü©m (dashed lines). By means 

of Raman sideband cooling pulses acting on the 9Be+ ion, the crystal is returned to the motional ground state after each 

 
transfer pulse. This ensures unidirectional optical pumping9. To increase the state-preparation efficiency, this sequence 

is repeated four times. The other Zeeman ground state (P1/2, m1/2 = +1/2) is prepared in an analogous manner.
