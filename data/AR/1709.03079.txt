Abstract: 
Black phosphorus (BP) has emerged as a promising material candidate for next generation electronic 
and  optoelectronic  devices  due  to  its  high  mobility,  tunable  band  gap  and  highly  anisotropic 
properties.  In  this  work,  polarization  resolved  ultrafast  mid-infrared  transient  reflection 
spectroscopy measurements are performed to study the dynamical anisotropic optical properties of 
BP under magnetic fields up to 9 T. The relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carrier is found to be 
insensitive  to  the  applied  magnetic  field  due  to  the  broadening  of  the  Landau  levels  and  large 
effective mass of carriers. While the anisotropic optical response of BP decreases with increasing 
magnetic  field,  its  enhancement  due  to  the  excitation  of  hot  carriers  is  similar  to  that  without 
magnetic  field.  These  experimental  results  can  be  well  interpreted  by  the  magneto-optical 
conductivity of the Landau levels of BP thin film, based on an effective k∙p Hamiltonian and linear 
response  theory.  These  findings  suggest  attractive  possibilities  of  multi-dimensional  controls  of 
anisotropic response (AR) of BP with light, electric and magnetic field, which further introduces BP 
to the fantastic magnetic field sensitive applications.

As a two-dimensional (2D) tunable-gap semiconductor with high mobility1-7, black phosphorus (BP) 
promises  enormous  applications  in  high  speed  transistors  with  large  on-off  ratio7-13  and  mid-IR 
optoelectronic devices14-19 surpassing graphene and many other two-dimensional materials20-23. Its 
highly anisotropic response (AR) would lead to interesting transport and optical properties, such as 
anomalous  magneto-optical  response24,  highly  anisotropic  wave-functions  of  the  Landau  levels 
(LLs)25 , and quasi-one dimensional excitonic state with larger binding energy26, 27 , which enables 
an additional degree of freedom for high performance functional device applications, especially in 
the applications where angle sensitive operations are desired3, 5, 26, 28-31. Investigating the AR of BP 
under various circumstances such as high field/speed limit or magnetic field are crucial for BP based 
angle sensitive devices. The tuning with magnetic field is greatly facilitated by recent introduction 
of 2D Ferromagnetic materials32-34 and convenient integration of van der Waals heterostructures35. 
Under these prospectives, steady state and magneto transport, optical characterization26, 28, 31 and 
even  high  speed  transport  properties36  have  been  applied  on  BP  to  characterize  its  fundamental 
anisotropy related physical responses. However, despite its importance in fundamental physics and 
device  applications,  the  dynamical  anisotropic  optical  response  of  photoexcited  carriers  under 
magnetic field, which is vital for any magnetic field related applications, has not been investigated 
experimentally so far. 

In  this  work,  polarization  resolved  ultrafast  mid-infrared  transient  reflection  spectroscopy 
measurements are performed under magnetic fields up to 9 T to study the dynamical evolution of 
anisotropic optical properties of BP. The relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carrier, which can be 
directly correlated to the transient reflection measurements, are found to be insensitive to the applied 
magnetic  field  up  to  9 T  due  to  the  broadening  of  the  LLs  and  large  effective  mass  of  carriers. 
Through pump polarization dependent magneto-transient reflection measurements, the AR of BP at 
pump  photon  transition  can  be  deducted,  and  it  is  revealed  from  these  measurements  that  the 
anisotropic  optical  response  of  BP  decreases  with  increasing  magnetic  field.  By  performing  the 
calculation of the magneto-optical conductivity of the LLs of black phosphorus thin film, based on 
an effective k∙p Hamiltonian and linear response theory, the results indicate the degradation of the 
AR is an effect of the compression of electron wave-function by magnetic fields. On the other hand, 
the dynamical evolution of optical conductivity at probe photon transition due to the excitation of 
hot  carriers  can  be  resolved  in  probe  polarization  dependent  magneto-transient  reflection 
measurements. The results indicate the enhancement of the AR of BP due to the excitation of hot 
carriers persists under magnetic fields, which is similar to our previous work on the AR of BP under 
high field/speed operation limit but without magnetic field.36. Further analysis indicates the relative 
enhancement of the AR due to hot carrier excitations does not decrease with increasing magnetic 
field, thus the hot-carrier acceleration either with photoexcitation or high electric and applying a 
magnetic field can provide multiple dimensional control of BP’s anisotropic degree of freedom.   

The schematic diagram of transient magneto-optical measurements is shown in Figure 1a and more 
experimental details and basic BP sample characterizations are described in the methods section. 
The effect of magnetic field on the AR of BP is determined by transient measurements with two 
different configurations of pump/probe wavelengths: 800 nm/1940 nm and 1940 nm/4000 nm with 
the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the BP xy-plane. Figure 1b and 1c show the optical and 
atomic  force  microscopy  images  of  a  typical  BP  sample  that  is  mechanically  exfoliated  from

synthesized  bulk  BP  crystal.  The  x-  and  y-axes  are  along  the  armchair  and  zigzag  direction, 
respectively, which is identified by the polarization-resolved reflection spectroscopy described in 
reference36. Thickness of this BP sample measured by atomic force scanning along the white dotted 
line shown in Figure 1d is about 101 nm, from which we can deduce that the sample contains around 
190 layers, using a layer spacing of 0.53 nm. The synthesized BP crystal is found to be p-doped with 
bulk doping density of 4.2×1018 cm-3 by Hall measurement, which converts to 4.24×1013 cm-2 for 
101-nm thick BP flake. The typical pump fluence for 800-nm and 1940-nm excitation is 8.1×1014 
and 5.4×1015 photons/cm2 respectively, which converts to 3.27×1014 and 2.18×1015 cm-2 electron-
hole  pairs  after  the  excitation  assuming  a  0.4%/nm  linear  absorption  rate  at  both  wavelengths2. 
Figure 1e shows the band structure of bulk BP and the difference of dispersion relation along -X 
and -Y direction indicating that the effective masses are also anisotropic. The probe photon energy, 
either  1940  nm  or  4000  nm,  involves  the  transition  from  the  highest  valence  band  and  lowest 
conduction band only. To measure the dynamic evolution of the AR, polarization resolved 1.55 eV 

(0.8-m)  /0.64  eV  (1.94-m)  and  0.64  eV  (1.94-m)/0.31  eV  (4-m)  probe  photon  arriving  at 
various delay time (t) with respect to pump pulse is used and the pump induced probe reflection 
change is recorded.

Results 
Photoexcited carrier dynamics under magnetic field. 
Figure  1f  shows  typical  magneto-transient  reflection  kinetics  with  pump  polarization  set  along 
crystal x-axis and probe polarization either parallel or perpendicular to that of the pump. In either 

cases,  the  transient  reflection  signals DR/R  are  negative  at  timezero  and  then  the  signal  evolves 
differently with different probe polarizations, which has been discussed extensively in our previous 
work36. Interestingly, in the present study, it is observed that the perpendicular magnetic field does 
not have any influence on the dynamical evolution of DR/R of BP up to 9 T with either 800-nm/1940-
nm or 1940-nm/4000-nm pump probe configurations. Usually, the discrete LLs that are induced in 
high magnetic fields will increase the photoexcited carrier relaxation time compared to continuous 
band,  as  the  relaxation  between  discrete  energy  level  has  to  fulfill  more  rigorous  energy  and 
momentum scattering process37. However, the observed dependence of the dynamic evolution of 
DR/R on magnetic field (up to 9 T) indicates that the photoexcited carrier relaxation time of BP is 
not influenced by the magnetic field.   

Degradation of anisotropic response under magnetic field. 
Though  the  magnetic  field  does  not  influence  the  photoexcited  relaxation  time  of  BP,  it  has  a 
profound impact on the wave-function of BP and thus affects its AR. Effect of magnetic field on the 
AR  of  BP  can  be  determined  by  measuring  the  transient  reflection  amplitude  at  different  pump 
polarization as shown in Figure 2. It is clearly evident from Figure 2 that the amplitude of transient 

reflection DR/R varies with pump polarization, while the shape of their kinetics remains the same 
(Figure 2a). In our previous work, it has been shown that the amplitude of transient reflection at 

timezero (DR/R|t=0) has linear dependence on photoexcited carrier density based on the pump power 
dependent  measurement36  and  the  DR/R|t=0(1)  is  proportional  to  pump  polarization  angle  (1, 
respective to crystal x-axis as marked in Figure 1a) dependent absorption coefficient A(1). Based 
on this, we can simply fit DR/R|t=0(1) as function of  (see Supplementary Note 1 for derivation): 

∆𝑅/𝑅|𝑡=0(𝛼1)~𝐴(𝛼1)~

4√𝜀1(𝑅𝑒(𝑥𝑥)𝑐𝑜𝑠2𝛼1+𝑅𝑒(𝑦𝑦)𝑠𝑖𝑛2𝛼1)
𝜀0𝑐(√𝜀2+√𝜀1)2

where, 1  and 2  are  dielectric  constants  of  substrate  and  air,  respectively, 0  is  the  free-space 
permittivity,  c  is  the  speed  of  light,  xx   and  yy  are  non-zero  diagonal  component  of  optical 
conductivity tensor. According to equation (1), DR/R|t=0(1=0°)~Re(xx), DR/R|t=0(1=90°)~Re(yy),   

so a measurement of DR/R|t=0(1) as function of 1 directly provides the conductivity ellipse (1) 
of BP at optical transitions corresponding to pump photon energy. In order to identify the influence 

of magnetic field on Re(xx) and Re(yy), pump polarization dependences under different magnetic 
fields are investigated experimentally. Figure 2b shows the evolution of experimentally measured 

conductivity  ellipses  as  function  of  applied  magnetic  fields. We  note  although  both  Re(xx)  and 
Re(yy) increases with applied magnetic field, the relative increment  𝑅𝑒(𝜎(𝐵))/𝑅𝑒(𝜎(0))  is much 

larger in y-direction compared to that in x-direction (Figure 2c). The ratio

|1940  𝑛𝑚, which 

describes the AR of BP at 1940 nm transition, decreases from 4.1 at 0 T to 2.7 at 9 T (Figure 2d). 

Similar trends are also observed for the AR of BP at 800-nm pump; 

𝑅𝑒(𝑥𝑥)
𝑅𝑒(𝑦𝑦)

|800  𝑛𝑚  decreases from 

6.8 at 0 T to 2.7 at 9 T (see, Supplementary Fig. 3). These results clearly indicate that the AR of BP 
degrades significantly with increasing magnetic fields. This phenomenon can be understood from a 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
semi-classical point of view. Under a magnetic field, charged carriers will do cyclotron motions. 
During this process, the wave-functions with momentums along different directions will be mixed, 
and hence the optical AR of BP tends to become less anisotropic. More information can be found in 
the discussion part and the theoretic details are presented in Supplementary Note 8.

Magnetic field enhanced relative anisotropy increment with hot carriers. 
Furthermore, the hot carrier induced anisotropy change under magnetic field is also investigated 
from probe polarization dependent transient reflection measurements. In the absence of magnetic 
field, the photoexcited hot carriers can enhance the AR of BP, which has been systematically studied 
in our previous work36. Figure 3a shows the probe polarization dependence of transient reflection 
kinetics under 9 T magnetic field. The dynamical evolution of the transient reflection signal with 
different probe polarization angle is similar to the one in the absence of magnetic field. At fixed 

pump-probe  delay, DR/R  demonstrates  sinusoidal  oscillation  as  a  function  of  probe  polarization 
(Figure  3b).  Except  for  the  initial  non-equilibrium  state,  this  periodic  oscillation  is  robust  and 
persists during the whole decay process (Figure 3b). After the initial relaxation of highly excited 

states,  the  measured DR/R  can  be  converted  to  optical  conductivity  change DRe()  through  the 
following relation (see Supplementary Note 4 for derivation):

where 1 is probe polarization angle respective to crystal x-axis as marked in Figure 1a. As can be 
seen in Figure 3d, under high magnetic field at 9 T, the conductivity ellipse is stretched at pump-
probe delay around 5 ps and later on gradually recovers as the delay time between pump and probe 
increases. The stretch of conductivity ellipse is similar to that in the absence of magnetic field, which 
is a result of photoexcitation of hot carriers. This behavior persists over the subsequent relaxation 
process  and  completely  recovers  after  the  relaxation  and  recombination  of  the  photoexcited  hot 
carriers. We can conclude from these results that the enhancement of ARin presence of hot carrier 
is well preserved under high magnetic field.

that D increases as magnetic field increases at all fixed pump-probe delays. Although the effect is 
not unambiguous considering the larger synthetic error bar of D%, however, it is safe to conclude 
that the magnetic field effect obviously does not degrade the relative enhancement of AR due to the 
presence of hot carriers. 

Discussion 
The experimentally observed magnetic field effect on dynamic evolution of photoexcited carriers 
can be phenomenological described by calculating the LL splitting and density of states around the 
probe photon transitions. To account for the temperature and inhomogeneous broadening of LLs in 
the sample, an anisotropic two-band k∙p Hamiltonian of BP coupled with a perpendicular magnetic 

field B and a Gaussian broadening  of the LLs is incorporated into the calculation. The details of 
this calculation are described in the Supplementary Note 8. The LLs without the broadening which 
get involved into the 1940-nm and 4000-nm probe transition with kz=0 are shown in Figure 4(a). 
Due to the large effective mass, the LLs are quite dense, and it’s splitting at probe transition of 0.64 
eV (1940 nm) and 0.31 eV (4000 nm) are only 4.3 (3.4) meV and 3.8 (2.8) meV, respectively, for 
valence (conduction) band under 9 T magnetic field. These tiny splittings can be smeared out by 
temperature (T=78 K, kT~6.72 meV) and inhomogeneous broadening due to disorder effect caused 

by impurities and defects. Figure 4(c) shows the density of states taking different LL broadening . 
With meV the LL splittings are barely visible in 9 T magnetic field and the peaks of the density 
of states are completely quenched by LL broadening (meV, Figure 4d). Hence, the relaxation 
of  photoexcited  carriers  from  highly  excited  states  to  probe  photon  transition  experiences 
continuous state instead of discrete Landau levels even under 9 T magnetic field, because of which 
the dynamics of photoexcited carrier relaxation (as observed in Figure 1f) is not influenced by the 
applied magnetic field.   

The AR under magnetic field could be described approximately by magneto-optical conductivity 
(MOC) of BP.    From the k∙p Hamiltonian of BP coupled with a perpendicular magnetic field B and 
Kubo Formula24, we can evaluate the longitudinal optical conductivities and plot the wave-function 
as  functions  of  the  photon  energy  and  magnetic  field  (see,  Supplementary  Note  8  ). The  spatial 
distribution of the wave-function for the LLs in the valence band at the excitation photon transition 
of 0.64 eV at kz=0 are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. Comparing to the wave-function at weaker 
magnetic  field  (B=6  T),  the  wave-function  under  9  T  magnetic  field  is  less  anisotropic. 
Quantitatively, if we plot the  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)  as a function of magnetic field which is shown in 
Figure  4b,  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)   gradually  decreases  with  increasing  magnetic  field,  which  is 
consistent with experimental observation. However, there are two major discrepancies comparing 
with  experimental  results:  First,  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦) oscillates  with  magnetic  field  in  Figure  4b, 
which  is  not  observed  in  experiment.  Measurement  of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦) with  fine  tuning  of 
magnetic field does not show clear oscillatory behavior (Supplementary Fig. 6), this is due to the 
quenching of the Landau level splittings at transitions corresponding to the pump photon energy as 
shown in Figure 4a. Second, the absolute magnitude of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)is far larger than those 
observed in the experiment. Theoretically, the  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)highly depends on the temperature 

7 

 
 
 
and  doping  intensity  as  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  7. As  the  experiment  is  performed  with 
femtosecond pulse,  the  absorption  of  falling  edge  of  the  pulse  is  strongly  affected by  the highly 
excited unequilibrium state of BP that are excited by the rising edge of the pulse, thus experimentally 
observed  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)  is strongly modified because the excited carriers and the magnitude is 
significantly different from our theory which is based on quasi-equilibrium state.

respectively. The kinks in the density of states are arising from the crossing of the Landau levels 
from different sub-bands in z-direction.   

Although the magnetic field significantly degrades the AR of BP, the hot carrier enhancement effect 
on AR is preserved under magnetic field as verified in probe polarization dependent measurement. 
These  experimental  results  further  extend  the  tuning  capability  on AR  with  hot  carriers  under 
magnetic field. Thus, in addition to magnetic field, excitation of hot carriers provides another tuning 
knob of the AR of BP which stays robust under high magnetic field. The hot carriers excitation with 
light  or  high  electric  field  together  with  applying  magnetic  field  provide  multiple  dimensional 
control of AR for high performance device with BP. Though the magnetic field control is usually 
considered not as convenient as electric field, recent introduction of two dimensional ferromagnetic 
semiconductor  materials32,  33    and  the  easy  van  der  Waals  integration  with  other  layered  2D 
materials  could  greatly  facilitate  the  magnetic  field  tuning  of  BP.    Furthermore,  large  range 
bandgap tuning of few-layer BP by electrical gating has also been realized experimentally38-40, this

dynamic  tuning  of  bandgap  may  further  realize  electrically  tunable  topological  insulators  and 
semimetals  with  BP41-43.  Together  with  other  tuning  knobs,  such  as  strain,  pressure44,  45,  BP  is 
becoming a very versatile materials platform that can be easily tuned between different condensed 
matter phases. Based on the above, the AR is adding another controllable degree of freedom to BP, 
which can be used for applications when angle sensitive application is desired. The experimental 
verification of the multiple dimensional control of this degree of freedom with high electric field 
acceleration  of  hot  carriers  and  magnetic  field  will  further  pave  the  way  for  future  multiple 
functional high performance devices based on BP. 

Methods: 
Sample preparation. 
Bulk  black  phosphorus  was  grown  by  chemical  vapor  deposition  as  described  before46.  Red 
phosphorus  (500  mg,  99.999+%), AuSn  (364  mg)  and  SnI4  were  sealed  in  an  evacuated  quartz 
ampule of about 12-cm length and 1-cm diameter (pressures lower than 10-3 mbar). Then this ampule 
was placed horizontally at the center of a single zone tube furnace chamber. The ampule was slowly 
heated to 873  K  in  10  hours and  maintained  at  this temperature  for  24  hours.  In  a next  step  the 
temperature  was  reduced  to  773  K  applying  a  cooling  rate  of  40  K/hour  and  maintained  this 
temperature before switching off the oven. Using this method black phosphorus with crystal sizes 
larger than 1-cm can be obtained. The thin black phosphorus flake was mechanically exfoliated from

To perform transient reflection spectroscopy measurement, a 250 kHz Ti-sapphire amplifier (RegA) 
system47, an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and a homemade difference frequency generator 
(DFG) were used. Laser pulses at 800-nm (1.55 eV) wavelength with 60-fs pulse width generated 
by RegA were injected into the OPA to generate 1350-nm (signal) and 1940-nm (idler) pulses. The 
1940-nm pulse (~150 fs) was used as either pump in 1940-nm/4000-nm measurement or probe in 
800-nm/1940-nm measurement. The dispersion-compensated residual 800-nm of the OPA was used 

as the pump. The OPA signal and idler can also be injected into the DFG to generate 4-m pulse 
which  is  used  as  probe  in  1940-nm  pump  experiment.  The  pump  and  probe  are  both  linearly 
polarized  and  two  half-wave  plates  are  used  to  alter  their  polarization  angle,  respectively.  A 
40×tranmissive or reflective objective lens was used to focus the co-propagating pump and probe 
beams onto the sample that was placed in a liquid helium-cooled cryostat for temperature control. 
A liquid cryogen-free superconducting magnet system was used to generate a magnetic field up to 
9 T perpendicular to the sample. The reflected probe beam was collected by the same reflective lens 
and detected by an InGaAs detector. The detected signal was read by lock-in amplifier referenced 
to 1.4-kHz mechanically chopped pump. The probe spot size is about 4  μm for 1940 nm probe and 
8  μm for 4000 nm probe and the pump spot size is slightly larger.

Supplementary  Note  2.  Faraday  rotation  of  the  transmissive  objective  lens under  high 
magnetic field.   
Unlike reflective objective lens, the light passing through transmissive objective lens experience a 
Faraday  rotation  due  to  the  effect  of  transmissible  materials  present  in  the  lens.  Hence,  while 
measuring the effect of polarization using transmissive objective lens, one should take into account 
the rotation induced by Faraday effects.     

Supplementary  Figure  1.  a,  Schematic  diagram  of  the  optical  setup  used  to  measure  the 
magnetic field induced change in polarization, b, c. Polarization analysis of Faraday rotation 
of 800-nm and 1940-nm beams under different magnetic field. x-axis is the polarization angle 
of analytic polarizer and y-axis is the transmitted power (measured by power meter) through 
analytic polarizer. 

Faraday  rotation  of  light  is  determined  by  measuring  the  pump  (800-nm)  and  probe  (1940-nm) 
polarization rotation using the optical setup shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a. In these measurements, 
the  incident  beam  with  fixed  polarization  was  focused  on  to  a  gold  mirror  in  normal  incidence 
geometry by transmissive objective lens and the reflected beam was collected by the same objective 
lens. The reflected beam was then sampled by a partial reflector and its polarization was identified

by an analytic polarizer together with a power meter. Supplementary Fig. 1b & c show the reflected 
power as a function of polarization angle of analytic polarizer. As the magnetic field increases from 
0 to 9 T, polarization of pump beam rotates up to 50°, but the polarization of probe beam remains 
constant indicating that only 800-nm beam experiences significant Faraday rotation while passing 
through  the  objective  lens.  As  the  reflected  800-nm  beam  passes  through  the  objective  lens 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b) twice during the measurement, its single-pass Faraday rotation angle can 
be determined from the change in the polarization angle of pump beam under the applied magnetic 
field. The variation in the pump beam polarization angle with increasing magnetic field is shown as 
red  circles  in  Supplementary  Fig.  2b  and  the  Faraday  rotation  angle  can  be  fitted  with 
B=3.22·B(degree).   

The Faraday rotation of the pump polarization is further confirmed from the DR/R|t=0 signal recorded 
as a function of incident pump polarization with fixed probe polarization at 0°, which is shown in 

Supplementary Fig. 2a. It is clearly evident from this figure that the ellipse rotates with respect to 

applied magnetic field. The pump polarization dependent DR/R|t=0 signal is fitted with the following 
function:   
DR/R|t=0()=A1cos2(++B)+A2sin2(++B)  
                        (3) 
where  is the polarization angle of incident light,  (= -9.3°) is the angle between crystal x-axis 
and initially arbitrarily defined 0°  of pump polarization, and B(B) is the magnetic field dependent 
rotation angle of the ellipse. The fitting parameters A1 and A2 correspond to the long and short axes 
of  ellipse,  respectively  and  their  ratio  is  given  by  A1/A2=Re(𝜎𝑥𝑥 )/Re(𝜎𝑦𝑦 ),  where  Re(𝜎𝑥𝑥 )  and 
Re(𝜎𝑦𝑦) is the real part of optical conductivity of BP at 800 nm. The obtained rotation angle B has 
linear dependence on the applied magnetic field B (represented as black circles in Supplementary 

Fig. 2b) with slope = 2.78. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2b, considering the error bar, B matches 
with pump, determined from Supplementary Fig. 1b, confirming that the rotation of conductivity 
ellipse  is  solely  due  to  the  Faraday  rotation  of  pump  polarization  when  passing  through  the 
transmissive objective lens.  Furthermore, it should be taken into account that this rotation is not 
observed when a reflective objective lens is used.

Supplementary Note 3. 800-nm pump polarization dependent results 
Supplementary  Fig.  3  shows  the  800-nm  pump  polarization  dependent  measurements  under 
different  magnetic field up to 9 T. The full time scans of the carrier dynamics at different pump 
polarization and fixed probe polarization are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a. The dependence of 

transient  reflectionDR/R  amplitude  on  pump  polarization  is  observed  while  their  relaxation 
dynamics  remains  the  same.  Supplementary  Fig.  3b  shows  the  evolution  of  experimentally 
measured conductivity ellipses as function of applied magnetic field. An increase in the magnitude 
of  both  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)   and  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)   is  observed  with  increasing  magnetic  field,  but  the  relative 
increment of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎(𝐵))/𝑅𝑒(𝜎(0))  is much larger in y-direction compared to that in x-direction 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c), indicating the anisotropic response(AR) of BP degrades as magnetic field 
increases.  As  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  3d,  the  ratio  of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)|800  𝑛𝑚 ,  which 
describes the AR of BP at 800 nm, decreases from 6.8 to 2.7 when the magnetic field is increased 
from 0 to 9 T.

Supplementary Note 4. Pump induced conductivity changes 
When the probe polarization is rotated, the shape as well as the magnitude of the transient reflection 
spectra  changes  (Supplementary  Fig.  4a).  In  all  probe  polarization  dependent  measurements,  a 
reflective objective lens is used to avoid the Faraday  rotation. Under two band model and using 
similar approximations used in the reference1: Im2(0
c, Re0c, and Dwhich is 
valid at quasi-equilibrium states of photoexcited carriers after the initial thermalization and cooling 
from highly unequilibrium state, the DR/R can be expressed as a function of conductivity changes 
due to the pump excitation, DRe(xx) and DReyy)2:

Where 2 is the polarization angle of the probe with respect to x-axis of BP. The experimentally 
measured probe polarization dependence of DR/R signal at certain delay time can be fitted with: 

∆𝑅

𝑅

|𝑡 =A1cos2𝛼2+A2 sin2𝛼2 

(5) 

which  is  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  4b.  From  Supplementary  Equation  (4)  and  (5),  the 
conductivity  change DRe(𝜎𝑥𝑥)|t  and DRe(𝜎𝑦𝑦)|t  at  certain  delay  time (t)  can  be  directly  obtained 
from the fitting parameters A1/2 from the following relation: 

∆𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)|𝑡 =

According  to  Supplementary  Equation  (6),  ∆𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥,𝑦𝑦)|𝑡   can  be  retrieved  from  the  probe 
polarization dependent experiments. The same method also applies to  ∆𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥/𝑦𝑦)|𝑡(𝐵).

Re(xx)-Re(yy) from polarization dependent transient reflection measurement of BP under magnetic 
field.

where 0  is the free-space permittivity, 1 and 2 are the  dielectric  constants of  air  and substrate, 
respectively, in our sample geometry; c is the speed of light, and  is the light polarization angle 
with respect to crystal x-axis.

Supplementary  Fig.  5a  shows  the  schematic  diagram  of  the  setup  used  to  measure  polarization 
resolved reflection. The polarization direction of 1940-nm beam was controlled by a half-wave plate 
before it passes through the objective lens. Here, a reflective objective lens was used to focus the 
1940-nm beam onto the sample to avoid Faraday rotation. Due to the AR of polarization sensitive 
optical elements in the setup, such as beam splitter, photo detector et al., the direct measurement of 
the BP sample reflection is not accurate. In order to rule out these extrinsic effects, the power of 
reflective  beam  of  a  bare  substrate  Isub  was  measured  beforehand  to  calibrate  the  polarization 
dependent response of the system. Then the focal spot was moved onto the sample and the reflected 
power  IBP  from  BP  sample  was  measured  with  the  same  experimental  conditions,  as  shown  in 
Supplementary Fig. 5b.   

The reflection of BP sample then can be expressed as:

where, a=√𝜀2 + 𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)/𝜀0𝑐, with  √𝜀2 = 𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑏, 2 and nsub are defined as dielectric constant and 
refractive index of the substrate, respectively. b=𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)−𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)  and  is the polarization angle 
of 1940 nm.   
Here  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)/𝜀0𝑐 ~0.005<< √𝜀2 ,  so  it  is  not  reliable  to  get  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)   directly  from  fitting 
parameter  a,  because  a  small  deviation  in  A  can  introduce  a  large  error  on  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦) .  However, 
b= 𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)−𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)   can  be  reliably  obtained  from  the  fitting  of  𝑅(𝛼)   as  shown  in 
Supplementary Table 1. 

As the substrate of BP is 285 nm SiO2 on Si, it is helpful to deduct the effective refractive index 2 
of the substrate. Due to its isotropic lattice structure, the substrate has isotropic reflective response 
to  normal  incident  light,  and  hence  the  reflection  of  substrate  does  not  have  any  polarization 
dependence. Characteristic transfer matrix of SiO2 that is used in the reflection calculation is:

If we consider the whole substrate Si/SiO2 together, the 1940-nm light would see a substrate with 
equivalent reflective index of nsub=1.7847. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, the fitting results 
of  𝐴 = 𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑏 + 𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)/𝜀0𝑐  are within reasonable agreement with the equivalent reflective index 
of the substrate.

Supplementary Note 7. Measurement with fine tuning of magnetic field   

Supplementary Fig. 6 shows the evolution of AR of BP when magnetic field is tuned around 7 T 
with fine steps down to 0.01 T. The evolution of experimentally measured conductivity ellipses as 
function of magnetic fields are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6a, the ratio of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)  has 
small variation when the magnetic field increases from 7.0 to 7.3 T (Supplementary Fig. 6b). It is 
not  clear  from  these  measurements  whether  the  small  fluctuations  of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)   are 
oscillations due to LLs, predicted by theory shown in Fig. 4b, as these fluctuations are within the 
experimental uncertainty and it is impossible to  match the oscillation period with the theoretical 
predictions.

From the numerically obtained eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the value of magneto-conductivity is 
determined from Supplementary Equation (19). 
As shown in Supplementary Fig.7, the ratio of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)  is found to have temperature and 
doping dependence. However, the monotonic decrease of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦)  with magnetic field 
(B)  is  unaffected  by  the  doping  and  temperature.  Both  temperature  and  doping  only  affect  the 
absolute amplitude of  𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑥𝑥)/𝑅𝑒(𝜎𝑦𝑦).

Landau level Wavefunctions in symmetric gauge of BP 
To see the anisotropy of wavefunctions under magnetic field, we adopt the symmetric gaugeB =
(−By, Bx, 0)/2. Similarly, we choose the eigenstates of  ℎ𝑐  as a basis to obtain the Landau levels 
of the whole system. To diagonalize  ℎ𝑐, firstly, we should perform a coordinate transformation

One can easily verify that  [𝑢, 𝑝𝑢] = 𝑖ℏ,  [𝑣, 𝑝𝑣] = 𝑖ℏ. When a perpendicular magnetic field applied,
