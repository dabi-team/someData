Monoenergetic muon neutrinos at 236 MeV are readily produced in intense medium-energy proton
facilities ((cid:38)2-3 GeV) when a positive kaon decays at rest (KDAR; K + → µ+νµ). These neutrinos
provide a unique opportunity to both study the neutrino interaction and probe the nucleus with
a monoenergetic weak-interaction-only tool. We present cross section calculations for quasielastic
scattering of these 236 MeV neutrinos oﬀ 12C and 40Ar, paying special attention to low-energy
aspects of the scattering process. Our model takes the description of the nucleus in a mean-ﬁeld
(MF) approach as the starting point, where we solve Hartree-Fock (HF) equations using a Skyrme
type nucleon-nucleon interaction. Thereby, we introduce long-range nuclear correlations by means of
a continuum random phase approximation (CRPA) framework where we solve the CRPA equations
using a Green’s function method. The model successfully describes (e, e(cid:48)) data on 12C and 40Ca in
the kinematic region that overlaps with the KDAR νµ phase space. In addition to these results, we
present future prospects for precision KDAR cross section measurements and applications of our
calculations in current and future experiments that will utilize these neutrinos.

INTRODUCTION

In the wake of the worldwide eﬀort to disentangle the
neutrino-oscillation puzzle, neutrino-nucleus interactions
are now studied with unprecedented vigour and intensity.
The analysis of accelerator-based experiments requires
a detailed modeling of the underlying neutrino-nucleus
cross section [1]. As the neutrinos in these experiments
are usually produced via charged particle decay-in-ﬂight
and hence arrive at the detector with a broad range of
energies, a major stumbling block is the reconstruction of
the incident neutrino energy in a particular interaction.
In addition to issues associated with the uncertain recon-
struction of the impinging particle’s energy, determining
the precise underlying reaction mechanism that gives rise
to the experimental observables remains a cumbersome
issue.

KDAR neutrinos oﬀer a distinctive opportunity to
study neutrino-nucleus interactions without having to
deal with the complications raised by neutrinos origi-
nating from meson decay-in-ﬂight with resulting broad
energy-distributions. These monoenergetic 236 MeV νµ
present an excellent tool for a more unambiguous cali-
bration of cross sections and the determination of weak-
interaction parameters, and carry the key to a better un-
derstanding of the role of, among others, initial and ﬁnal-
state interactions, correlations in the nuclear medium
and multi-nucleon knockout. In general, KDAR νµ can
help to reduce experimental and theoretical uncertainties
and ambiguities in an unprecedented way.

KDAR neutrinos are also highly relevant for under-
standing astrophysical neutrinos. In contrast to the typ-

ical GeV-scale neutrino sources produced by particle ac-
celerators, especially from meson decay-in-ﬂight, astro-
physical neutrinos often have lower energies, usually in
the 0-100 MeV region. Still, their interactions with nu-
clei are, at best, just as poorly known as those of lab-
made neutrinos. Owing to their relatively small energy,
the 236 MeV KDAR νµ therefore oﬀers an important
opportunity to gain insight into the interactions of astro-
physical neutrinos. These are especially important in the
dynamics of type II supernovae and the nucleosynthesis
processes taking place in these events. KDAR νµ provide
120
cross sections with energy transfers up to Eν −
mµ ≈
MeV thereby covering a range of nuclear responses that
is in the realm of supernova neutrinos.
In particular,
forward scattering of 236 MeV νµ with low momentum
transfers should be able to provide precious information
about the low-energy excitations important in the inter-
actions of astrophysical neutrinos, complementing exper-
iments performed with neutrinos from muon decay-at-
rest at lower energy (0-53 MeV) [2–6].

In this work, we study the total and diﬀerential charged
current quasielastic (CCQE) cross sections of 236 MeV
KDAR neutrinos.
Importantly, the relevant energy
transfer for these interactions is situated at the low-
energy part of the genuine quasi-elastic region. The im-
pact of nuclear eﬀects and low-energy excitations can
therefore be expected to be relatively large, making a
detailed microscopic modeling of these neutrino reac-
tions, with a careful treatment of nuclear physics eﬀects,
In order to address these low-energy and
mandatory.
nuclear-structure aspects with all due care, we use the
continuum random phase approximation (CRPA) formal-
ism discussed in Refs. [7–16].

The CRPA formalism starts from a Hartree-Fock (HF)
model for the nuclear ground state. Wavefunctions for
the outgoing nucleon are determined as a solution of the
positive-energy Schr¨odinger equation fed with the same
nuclear potential used for the calculation of the ground

 
 
 
 
 
 
state. In this way, Fermi motion and binding are included
naturally, and the inﬂuence of Pauli-blocking and elastic
ﬁnal state interactions are taken into account in a consis-
tent way. While at high energy transfers the strong ﬁnal
state potential should be weaker than the HF potential of
the initial state [17], at the low momentum transfers con-
sidered here the present approach should be a reliable ap-
proximation. The CRPA incorporates long-range correla-
tions, indispensable for a proper description of the giant-
resonance region, through a Green’s function approach
that results in a natural description of the single-particle
continuum. The strength of the residual interaction is
constrained using a dipole form factor with a cut-oﬀ mass
ﬁtted in a comparison with electron data [14]. Relativis-
tic corrections are implemented following the procedure
outlined in Ref. [14, 18]. The Coulomb corrections for
the outgoing lepton in charged-current (CC) interactions
are taken into account using the approach proposed in
Ref. [19]. In order to take into account the ﬁnite width
of the single-particle excitations, the nuclear responses
are folded with a Lorentzian with a width of 3 MeV [14].
This folding procedure does not aﬀect integrated cross
sections, or the shape of the quasielastic peak. The eﬀects
of short-range correlations and meson-exchange currents,
which where implemented in the same HF framework in
Refs. [20, 21], are not included in the present results.

Experimentally, the KDAR neutrino has just begun to
be studied, although there are now a number of existing
and planned experiments that will be able to take advan-
tage of it. As one example, the NuMI beamline absorber
at Fermilab is a prominent KDAR νµ source. A number
of neutrino detectors in the vicinity of the NuMI beam
absorber are sensitive to these neutrinos. Recently, Mini-
BooNE, a Cherenkov- and scintillation-based mineral oil
detector located about 85 m from the NuMI beamline
absorber, has successfully isolated 236 MeV KDAR νµ
events using muon energy reconstruction and timing in-
formation [22]. Thereby, the MiniBooNE collaboration
reported the ﬁrst (and only so far) measurement of mo-
noenergetic KDAR νµ interactions on 12C [22]. This re-
sult is discussed in more detail and compared to various
generator- and model-based predictions below.

This paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we
establish and discuss the kinematic region probed by CC
scattering of a 236 MeV νµ in terms of energy and mo-
mentum transferred to the nucleus. Then, in Section III,
we compare the CRPA model to the electron scattering
data that overlaps with this kinematic region. Next, in
Section IV, the νµ-induced CC cross section is presented
and studied in detail, and in Section V, we present future
prospects for precise KDAR cross section measurements,
in particular on argon and carbon targets. Finally in
Section VI we provide some insight in how modeling and
measurements of the KDAR νµ cross section could prove
useful for neutrino oscillation and exotic-search experi-
ments, both from direct measurements and by constrain-
ing the cross section itself.

respectively. Here kl and El are the charged lepton’s en-
ergy and momentum, and θl is the scattering angle with
respect to the incoming neutrino direction. In terms of
these variables, the available phase space for the CC in-
teraction of a 236 MeV νµ is given by the purple shaded
region in Fig. 1. In principle, this region extends down
to ω = 0; the smallest energy transfer needed to excite a
bound nucleon to the continuum in the CRPA model for
12C is shown. The contributions of discrete excitations of
the nucleus are not considered in this work. Interactions
with ﬁxed lepton scattering angles cos θµ run along the
parabolae shown by the dotted lines. The dotted line de-
noting cos θµ = 0 is shown in orange; q values above and
below this line thus correspond to backward and forward
scattered muons respectively.

To appreciate the inﬂuence of low-energy nuclear ef-
fects on the scattering process it is instructive to contrast
the CRPA with the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model.
In the RFG model, the interaction proceeds with a Fermi
sea of non-interacting nucleons, occupying all momentum
states up to the Fermi momentum kF . For carbon, we
will use kF = 228 MeV [23]. Additionally, one introduces
a binding energy Es in the RFG as a shift in the energy
transfer by substituting ω
Es when computing
→
the response. We choose Es = 25 MeV, a value repre-
senting the average binding energy in the CRPA model
for carbon. The response in the RFG for certain values
of ω and q is proportional to the number of nucleons in
the Fermi sea that can contribute to the interaction. The
quasielastic peak is then the value for which this num-
ber is maximal. For a given energy transfer ω, the peak
position is given by

RFG both the bound and outgoing nucleons are de-
scribed by plane wave momentum eigenstates. Thus for a
speciﬁc outgoing nucleon momentum and values of ω and
q only a single initial nucleon state can contribute. This
leads to the fact that the RFG response is only non-zero
in between the dashed blue lines of Fig. 1, as outside this
region there are no nucleons available in the Fermi sea
for an interaction to occur.

In the CRPA model by contrast, both the initial and
ﬁnal state nucleons occupy single-particle states which
are energy eigenstates of a central potential. The ini-
tial state nucleons have energies below the free nucleon

FIG. 1. The phase space covered in 236 MeV νµ CC interactions is shown by the purple region. The dotted black lines denote
ﬁxed scattering angles, with the dotted orange line corresponding to cos θµ = 0. In principle, this region extends to ω = 0,
but as the lowest single-particle energy in carbon within the CRPA model is around 17 MeV, nucleons cannot be excited to
the continuum below this threshold. The region in which the RFG response is non-zero lies between the blue dashed lines.
The blue cross-shaded region shows the region that is aﬀected by Pauli-blocking in the RFG. The available inclusive electron
scattering data-points that overlap with the KDAR kinematic region are shown by the black dots. Finally, the full orange line
shows the position of the quasielastic peak.

mass.
In carbon only 2 neutron shells are populated,
leading to an average binding energy of around 25 MeV.
The threshold for a non-zero response to the continuum
is not this average binding energy but rather the small-
est single particle energy such that the available phase
space goes down to lower ω than in the RFG. The out-
going nucleon is also an energy eigenstate rather than a
momentum eigenstate. Speciﬁcally the outgoing nucleon
wavefunction behaves as an on-shell nucleon with ﬁxed
momentum for large distances from the nucleus, but is a
mixture of momentum states in the nuclear interior. This
means that there is no sharp cut-oﬀ at high ω for a spe-
ciﬁc q (or equivalently for high missing momentum) like
in the RFG. Instead, the response smoothly goes to zero
as determined by the high-momentum tail of the nuclear
wavefunctions.

An important remark concerning the kinematics of the
process involves the Pauli-blocked region. Again within
the simple RFG model, owing to the orthogonality of
the initial and ﬁnal state plane waves, Pauli-blocking oc-
curs if the outgoing nucleon’s momentum is below kF ,
in which case the interaction does not occur. The re-
gion in which this happens in the RFG is represented by
the blue shaded region in Fig 1. From these considera-
tions, it is clear that the KDAR phase space is situated
in the transition region between the low-energy and gen-
uine quasi-elastic regime, with large contributions from
the threshold and Pauli-blocked regions, especially for
forward lepton angles.

can provide constraints on the cross section modeling in
this low-Q2 region.

Finally, we point out that there is signiﬁcant overlap of
the phase space available for CC scattering of 236 MeV νµ
with a large body of inclusive electron scattering data.
The datapoints for carbon are shown in Fig. 1 as an ex-
ample. A combined analysis of this electron scattering
and future KDAR νµ data, with a model that treats the
vector and axial currents consistently, could be revealing
for the axial contribution to the nuclear current.

III. VALIDATION WITH ELECTRON
SCATTERING

With the kinematics of the process established in the
previous section, here we confront the CRPA model with
the available inclusive electron scattering data on 12C
and 40Ca that overlap with the same kinematic region
in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. We point out that in the
CRPA a dipole form factor is introduced in the residual
interaction to regularize the zero-range Skyrme force at
high values of Q2. The single parameter, a cut-oﬀ mass
of 455 MeV, is determined from a global ﬁt to (e, e(cid:48)) data
over a large kinematic range. As such, in this particular
kinematic region where q is comparable to the Fermi mo-
mentum, this suppression of CRPA eﬀects tends to be
too strong. We therefore also show the result without
the cut-oﬀ, and ﬁnd a 5-10% reduction at intermediate
q, illustrated by the blue band, which can be considered
as uncertainty.
In the rest of this paper we retain the
dipole form-factor in the residual interaction consistent
with Ref. [14]

It is clear that a large part of the phase space rele-
vant to the KDAR νµ is sensitive to nuclear structure
details, which are clearly shown in the CRPA cross sec-
tions. The agreement of the CRPA model with the elec-
tron scattering data is reassuring for two reasons. First,
the charge changing weak vector current operator has the
same structure as the electromagnetic current, as accord-
ing to the conserved vector current (CVC) relation they
are part of a conserved isotriplet, thereby directly relat-
ing the vector current of the weak interaction to those
measured in electron scattering [32]. This means that
the ability to describe the inclusive electron scattering
cross section data is a prerequisite for describing the vec-
tor current in neutrino interactions.

Second, a good agreement with the electron scattering
data lends conﬁdence in the nuclear model. Indeed, we
stress that the parameters of the CRPA model are not
tuned in order to reproduce scattering data, except for
the cut-oﬀ in the residual interaction. The model relies
on solving the Schr¨odinger equation for initial and ﬁnal
state nucleons in a nuclear potential. This potential is ob-
tained in a self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation with
an extended Skyrme force (SkE2), whose parameters are
ﬁt to reproduce static properties (charge radii, and ex-
citation energies) of a representative set of closed-shell

FIG. 3. Diﬀerential cross section for the CC scattering of νµ
on carbon with diﬀerent energies as a function of Q2.

In the CRPA, Pauli-blocking is naturally included as
all ﬁnal-state wavefunctions are built from energy states
that are obtained in the same mean-ﬁeld potential as is
used for the initial state. Therefore the wavefunctions
are orthogonal and thus satisfy the exclusion principle.
To show the inﬂuence of Pauli-blocking on the cross sec-
tion explicitly, the CRPA and RFG cross sections for
ﬁxed values of q are shown in Fig. 2. Here one clearly
sees that the Pauli-blocked and threshold region account
for a large part of the cross section strength, and that a
simpliﬁed non-interacting model does not provide a sat-
isfactory description.

It is also interesting to have a look at the Q2 region
covered in the interaction of a 236 MeV νµ CC scattering.
This is shown in Fig. 3, along with the cross section for
500 MeV νµ, an energy that lies close to the peak of the
MiniBooNE [24] and T2K [25] ﬂuxes. In recent years the
low (reconstructed) Q2 region has been the most chal-
lenging part of the phase-space to describe in MC gen-
erators. RPA calculations such as the ones of Nieves
et al. [26] have shown that including collective eﬀects
is paramount for describing the inclusive cross section
in this kinematic region. These calculations have found
their way to the most popular neutrino event genera-
tors, albeit usually through an inclusive response table,
while the hadronic side of the interaction is still taken
from RFG-like momentum distributions. With the ad-
vent of measurements of the hadronic ﬁnal state, it can
be expected that a consistent treatment of inclusive and
exclusive observables will become necessary, as evidenced
by recent measurements from the MicroBooNE collabo-
ration [27]. In any case, it is clear that KDAR νµ data

cross section where the dipole cut-oﬀ in the residual interaction is removed (see text) is shown in purple. The blue band

nuclei [33]. The agreement with electron scattering data
is thus essentially a prediction that does not rely on a
measurement of binding energies or momentum distribu-
tions. This excellent agreement, especially in the low ω
and q region where the position of the single-particle res-
onances is correctly reproduced, thereby lends conﬁdence
to the predictive power of the model for the neutrino cross
section in this kinematic region.

In confronting the model with both carbon and calcium
data we ﬁnd that the calcium data seem to be slightly
better described by the CRPA. On the one hand calcium
is a larger, and moreover doubly magic, nucleus for which
the mean-ﬁeld treatment should be expected to work bet-
ter. On the other hand the calcium data is mostly ob-
tained at backward scattering angles and at lower incom-
ing energies than for carbon. Thereby the data highlights

a diﬀerent weighting of the longitudinal and transverse
responses that enter the cross section, with the backward
scattering cross section having a larger contribution from
the transverse response.

The simultaneous description of the diﬀerent carbon
and calcium data in this kinematic region without the
modiﬁcation of any parameters lends conﬁdence to the
ability of the model to provide predictions for diﬀerent
nuclei.

fer and scattering angle. This section is organized as fol-

lows, ﬁrst in subsection IV A we compare the predictions
of the CRPA and several other models to the measure-
ment of the muon energy distribution in the CC interac-
tion of KDAR νµ from MiniBooNE [22]. Then in IV B
we compare the cross section predictions for argon and
carbon and explain how the A-dependence is handled in
the CRPA model. Next, in subsection IV C, the con-
tributions of the diﬀerent nuclear responses to the cross
section are presented and compared to the cross section
obtained at larger energies. Finally, in subsection IV D,
we show the contribution of diﬀerent multipole moments
to the cross section and illustrate that a consistent de-
scription of initial and ﬁnal state wavefunctions has large
eﬀects on the description of the forward scattering cross
section.

A. Shape comparison to KDAR data

The MiniBooNE collaboration has performed a mea-
surement of the shape-only distribution of muon energies
for νµ with Eν = 236 MeV on carbon [22]. The data is
available as an allowed region to which a shape-only com-
parison can be made with an online tool [34]. In Fig. 6 we
show the Tµ distributions for several models available on
the website. These include the results of the NuWro [35],
Nuance [36], and GENIE [37] event generators. Results
are also given for the models of Martini et al. [38] and
Singh et al. [39]. In addition to these, we show the results
obtained within the CRPA model described here and the
relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF) model of Ref. [40]. Table I
shows how well the MiniBooNE data matches a number
of predictions from various models and generators. The
value of χ2
prediction is obtained from a direct comparison
between the model in question and the MiniBooNE data,
as described in Ref. [22]. The program takes the shape-

a sharp fall-oﬀ around this threshold. The other models
have a lower threshold, and are rather similar in shape.
The data tends to prefer models with a larger threshold;
in reality, however, the CC cross section could extend
down to nearly zero energy transfer when discrete exci-
tations of the nucleus are taken into account.

The Martini and Singh models are similar in shape,
with the main diﬀerence between them that the Martini
model provides more strength in the low-Tµ tail, while
the Singh model places this strength in the high-Tµ re-
gion. Note, however, that the latter predicts a signif-
icantly smaller total cross section than the other mod-
els because of a strong quenching due to RPA correc-
tions [39]. The CRPA and RMF models place even more
strength in the high Tµ peak compared to the tail due
to single particle resonances that arise in the mean ﬁeld.
These eﬀects are more apparent for the CRPA results,
which include collective strength induced by long-range
eﬀects explicitly.

There are other approaches not included in this com-
parison which could provide a description of CC scat-
tering oﬀ carbon in this kinematic region. These in-
clude the aforementioned RPA model of Nieves et al. [26],
and several spectral function approaches that include
FSI [41–43]. Recently, electroweak responses of carbon
700 MeV were computed ab initio
for 100 MeV
using quantum Monte Carlo methods with a consistent
treatment of one- and two-body currents [44].

Although there are signiﬁcant micro- and macro-shape
diﬀerences between the various models in terms of Tµ/ω,
we note that the experimental ability to reconstruct

Due to the large uncertainty on the coarse MiniBooNE
measurement, the data do not provide signiﬁcant prefer-
ences among the diﬀerent approaches. Despite this, sev-
eral remarks can be made regarding the results. First,
the endpoint for Tµ is an important parameter in the
data, and diﬀerent given endpoints provide a diﬀerent
shape. This is because the location of the endpoint is
not held ﬁxed in the analysis, it is allowed to vary in the
ﬁt between 95-115 MeV, and the shape of the extracted
spectrum is then dependent on this endpoint. The high
Tµ limit for QE scattering is determined by the minimal
energy needed to eject a nucleon from the nucleus, which
is not necessarily equal to the average binding energy
of the nucleus as it is in e.g. a RFG approach. We see
that the Nuance and NuWro results are similar to the
RFG prediction with a binding energy of approximately
35 MeV. The GENIE result shown is similar in shape,
but with a lower threshold of around 25 MeV, and with

or less, for example, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the shape
of the RFG and CRPA cross sections are seen, and the
cross section becomes quite sensitive to the treatment of
Pauli-blocking and binding energy. However, even with
Tµ only and although the single-MeV-scale width nuclear
resonances predicted by CRPA and RMF are likely dif-
ﬁcult to resolve, the signiﬁcant diﬀerences between peak
position and binding energy, on the order of 20 MeV,
among the models should be readily resolvable by all the
experiments discussed in Sec. V, even those without the
ability to measure muon angle. Further, the ability to re-
construct the hadronic component of the interaction also
provides additional power for model comparisons as well.
Prospects for KDAR measurements in terms of a number
of experimental observables with various detector tech-
nologies are discussed below in Sec. V.

B. Coulomb eﬀects and A-dependence

First, we describe how the eﬀect of the Coulomb po-
tential of the nucleus on the charged lepton is taken into
account. In principle this problem can be solved by treat-
ing the outgoing lepton as an energy eigenstate in the
Coulomb potential of the nucleus. In general Coulomb
eﬀects are small for leptons with energies of a couple hun-
dred MeV and for nuclei lighter than iron. They can be
estimated quite adequately for integrated cross sections
by using the modiﬁed eﬀective momentum approxima-
tion (MEMA) [19].

In the MEMA approach the outgoing lepton plane

wave’s momentum and normalization is modiﬁed as

the momentum transfer entering the matrix element by

For small outgoing energies the correction from MEMA
becomes inappropriate and the eﬀect of the Coulomb dis-
tortion can be included by making use of the Fermi fac-
tor, which is the ratio of a plane wave and the Coulomb
wave function if only s-wave contributions are taken into
account [19]. In our calculations, we interpolate between
both approaches as detailed in Ref. [45], but for muon
cross sections in this work this procedure naturally leads
to the MEMA correction. The eﬀect of the MEMA for νµ
scattering is shown explicitly in Fig. 8 where results for
CC scattering oﬀ argon and carbon are computed with
and without the MEMA. The main increase stems from
larger energy transfers, i.e. smaller outgoing muon en-
ergies, as expected. We apply the appropriate Coulomb
corrections for all further results in this work unless men-
tioned otherwise.

Carbon, oxygen, and increasingly argon are the pre-
dominant targets in current and future neutrino scatter-
ing experiments. It is therefore important to study varia-
tions of the cross section across a range of nuclear masses.
Cross sections for neutrino interactions with diﬀerent nu-
clei computed within the CRPA approach were presented
previously in Ref. [16]. Here we restrict ourselves to in-
teractions with carbon and argon as these are the targets
used in experiments that aim at measuring KDAR cross
sections. In Fig. 8 we ﬁrst look at the single diﬀerential
cross sections in terms of energy transfer and scattering

nuclear responses

It is common and instructive to write the cross sec-
tion for leptonic scattering oﬀ nuclei in terms of speciﬁc
factors that arise from the lepton and hadron vertices.
In this way the dependence on the lepton kinematics
is made clear. The inclusive nuclear response functions
that arise in this separation then only depend on the
energy and momentum carried by the exchanged gauge
boson. We only give the expressions necessary to deﬁne
the results presented in the following sections; for a com-
plete derivation of these expressions we refer the reader
to Refs. [49, 50].

When the hadronic ﬁnal state remains completely un-
detected the only relevant direction for the nuclear sys-
tem is that of the momentum transfer (cid:126)q. This means that
no mixing of longitudinal and transverse terms relative
to the direction of the momentum transfer can occur and
the cross section is the sum of the longitudinal and trans-
verse parts shown in Eqs. 5 and 6 respectively. The last
term vanishes when averaged over the helicity h of the
incoming lepton, as is the case in unpolarized electron
scattering, but is always present for neutrino scattering.
We will denote it by σT (cid:48), while the ﬁrst term in Eq. 6 is
denoted as σT .

We stress that the nuclear responses only depend on
the energy and momentum transfer ω and q, and not
directly on the lepton kinematics. The dependencies of
the cross section on the lepton kinematics are completely
determined by the Vi factors which are easily evaluated

bon and argon. The dashed lines are CRPA predictions with
MEMA corrections.

angle. The cross sections for CC scattering of carbon
and argon are shown, normalized per neutron. The main
complication for calculations on argon lies in the fact
that the outerlying proton and neutron shells are not
fully occupied. We therefore compute the argon single
particle wavefunctions and mean-ﬁeld potential with the
same self-consistent Hartree-Fock procedure as for car-
bon and calcium, but with fractional occupation numbers
for these outerlying shells. This procedure yields good re-
sults for the charge-distribution and compares well with
RMF [46] and no-core shell-model [47] calculations for
the neutron distributions [48]. In Ref. [17] good agree-
ment was found between the RMF and HF/CRPA cross
sections for electron scattering oﬀ both argon and carbon.

An important diﬀerence with respect to the KDAR
measurements is the signiﬁcantly smaller threshold for
single nucleon knockout in argon compared to carbon.
The forward scattering region mostly overlaps with the
peak in the low-ω region at small q, which means that the
argon cross section becomes larger for forward scattering.
Also, we note that the increase of the cross section due
to the Coulomb potential is naturally larger in argon as
the nuclear charge is bigger.

The nuclear response functions will be further described
in Sec. IV D, where we consider the multipole decomposi-
tion. Here we will just add that all the diﬀerent terms in
the cross section of Eqs. 5 and 6 are sums of purely vector-
vector and axial-axial contributions, except for σT (cid:48) which
is a vector-axial interference term.

In Fig. 9 we show the cross section for CC scattering
separated into the longitudinal and both transverse con-
tributions. We show cross sections for Eν = 236 MeV for
both carbon and argon. Additionally the cross section
for Eν = 500 MeV, closer to the peak of the MiniBooNE

and T2K neutrino ﬂuxes, is shown in order to highlight
the diﬀerences. It is clear that the KDAR cross sections
are far more sensitive to the nuclear structure and asso-
ciated single-particle excitations than the 500 MeV cross
section whose main strength stems from higher energy
transfers. For 236 MeV νµ, the dominant contribution is
provided by the transverse response, especially at back-
ward scattering angles, while the forward peak seen for
the higher incoming neutrino energies disappears due to
Pauli-blocking.
In Fig. 10, the longitudinal and trans-
verse cross sections are shown separated into their vec-
tor and axial contributions. This shows that the lon-
gitudinal cross section is dominated by the vector cur-
rent, while the transverse cross section is mostly axial.
The small axial contribution in the longitudinal cross
section is forward peaked, and grows in relative impor-
tance for smaller incoming energies. If the lepton mass
can be neglected, the vector contribution to the longitu-
dinal current becomes exactly zero for completely back
and forward scattered leptons. If the lepton mass can-
not be neglected, the cross section for backward angles
is a mix between a small longitudinal and a larger trans-
verse contribution. From the diﬀerent panels, it becomes
clear that the relative weight of various contributions to
the total interaction strength can be quite diﬀerent for

D. Multipole decomposition

Here we take a closer look at the nuclear response func-
tions introduced in the previous section and show how a
multipole decomposition is performed. By separating the
responses in multipoles of total angular momentum of the
exchanged boson one gets additional insight into the dy-
namics of the problem. Diﬀerent multipole moments not
only correspond to a diﬀerent weighting of the scattered
lepton’s angle but also of the angular momentum of the
hadronic ﬁnal state.

Again we only give the essential expressions to illus-
trate the results presented in this section; for a com-
plete derivation we refer the reader to Refs. [50, 51]. The
expression for the nuclear current in terms of a general

where Ψi and Ψf are the wavefunctions describing the
initial and ﬁnal nuclear state, respectively. As we work
in a spherically symmetric potential, the initial state is
described by a Slater determinant of single particle an-
gular momentum eigenstates. The single particle wave
function is described by the product of a radial wave-
function and a spin-spherical harmonic

This is also the case for the ﬁnal-state wave functions. In
a central potential, the wave function for an outgoing nu-

sum of partial waves that are angular momentum eigen-
states. With the single particle wave functions written

As the matrix element is now written as a function of
irreducible tensor operators evaluated between good an-
gular momentum eigenstates the Wigner-Eckart theorem
can be used to write the expectation value of these oper-
ators as a product of a 3j-symbol and a reduced matrix
element involving only the radial wavefunctions [50]. If
we compute the square of this matrix element and sum
over the unobserved initial and ﬁnal state quantum num-
bers we can identify the nuclear responses in terms of
these reduced matrix elements

This result is general and does not depend on the tran-
sition operator. The only assumptions made are the
structure of the hadron current in Eq. (8), and that
the initial and ﬁnal states have good angular momen-
tum quantum numbers. For details on the operator used
in this work we refer the reader to Ref. [52].

In addition to allowing for an analytical evaluation of
the angular integral in the hadron current, the multipole
expansion supplies information about the dynamics of
the scattering problem. In Fig. 11 the relative contribu-
tions of the J
8 multipoles to the total cross section are
shown for diﬀerent incoming energies and nuclei. The J
in the expansion is the total angular momentum carried
by the gauge boson that instigates the nuclear response.
As the total initial nuclear angular momentum is 0, J
is also the angular momentum of the residual hadronic
system consisting of a “hole”-state with the angular mo-
mentum jh of the selected initial single particle state and
a continuum state with angular momentum jp. The an-
gular momentum of the hole state that can be created in

the interaction is limited by the maximal available angu-

a certain J the angular momentum of the outgoing nu-
cleon jp is hence limited to

jh −
|
for low J the relative weight of the lowest order partial
waves for the outgoing nucleon will become more impor-
tant and the process tends to be more strongly aﬀected
by the nuclear potential and long-range correlations. For
lower incoming energies only the smaller multipoles will
contribute considerably. Indeed, for interactions on car-
bon the multipoles up to J = 3 account for around 90
percent of the total cross section when the incoming en-
ergy is 180 MeV. For the KDAR νµ this is just below 80
percent and for the MiniBooNE peak energy this number
is reduced to a mere 40 percent.

Also the size of the nucleus plays a role, as a larger nu-
cleus will require more partial wave contributions for the
same momentum transfer. Wave functions that extend
to larger r, will overlap more strongly with higher order
spherical bessel functions jJ (qr) that enter the matrix
elements of Eqs. (10-13). Another way to see this is by
realizing that larger nuclei have more bound state wave
functions with larger jh that will extend to larger radii,
thereby allowing larger jp values for a given J. This can
be seen in the comparison of argon and carbon cross sec-
tions.

In Fig. 12 the diﬀerential cross sections in terms of
energy transfer and scattering angle are shown, where the
contributions from J
3 and J > 3 multipoles are shown
separately. In argon we see that higher order multipoles
still carry a lot of the strength at low excitation energies,
as the angular momentum of initial single particle states
can be higher.

≤

The lowest J mainly contribute to the forward scat-
tering cross section (lower q), while the higher multipole
contributions are suppressed for forward angles. This
shows that ﬁnal-state interactions and collective eﬀects
will be more important for the forward region. This
fact remains even for higher incoming energies. This is
most clear from the results shown in Fig. 13. Here the
same contributions to the cross section are shown, but
the HF model with ﬁnal state wavefunctions obtained in
the nuclear potential is compared to plane wave results
(HFPW). The operators and initial state wavefunctions
in these results are exactly the same. The only diﬀer-
ence is that the ﬁnal state wavefunctions in the HFPW
are not inﬂuenced by the nuclear potential. Indeed, in-
cluding ﬁnal-state distortion mainly aﬀects the lowest or-
der partial waves. This leads to the PW approximation
overestimating the cross section especially in the forward
scattering region. As explained in Refs. [40, 53] this is
mainly due to the lack of orthogonality between the ini-

For a consistent description of both the cross section in
terms of excitation energy and scattering angle, the con-
sistency of initial and ﬁnal state wavefunctions has to be
guaranteed, especially when the relative contribution of
the lowest order multipoles is large.

Summarizing, the multipole analysis makes clear that
KDAR neutrinos tend to be probing quite diﬀerent as-
pects of the nuclear dynamics as compared to higher
energy neutrinos. As a consequence, diﬀerences in re-
sponses and cross section distributions should hence not

SECTION MEASUREMENTS

In the near

There are a number of existing and planned experi-
ments that will be able to study the KDAR νµ-nucleus
interaction. We describe these prospects in this section.
the MicroBooNE [54] and
liquid argon time projection chamber

(LArTPC) detectors, located about 102 m and 114 m
from the NuMI beam absorber (discussed above), re-
spectively, may be able to use their imaging and recon-

struction capabilities to precisely isolate and measure the
ﬁrst monoenergetic νµ interactions on 40Ar. This will
likely require being able to reconstruct the few-10s-of-
MeV hadronic part of the KDAR interaction products
at some level, in addition to the muon kinematics, to-
wards a determination of the initial neutrino’s direction.
Direction reconstruction is important for these measure-
ments in order to point the KDAR νµ event candidates
back to the absorber, given the substantial decay-in-
ﬂight neutrino background which mainly originates from
the NuMI target station rather than the absorber [56].
However, the pointing requirements for this purpose are
very modest given the large angle between the target-
station-to-detector vector (decay-in-ﬂight background)
and absorber-to-detector vector (KDAR signal). This
angle is 110◦ for MicroBooNE, for example [56]. Assum-
ing production at the NuMI beam absorber at the level
of 0.05 KDAR νµ per proton-on-target (the NuMI target
is 2.5 interaction lengths and 80% of the power reaching
the absorber is due to primary protons [57], so we as-
sume 7% of all protons-on-target make it to the absorber
725 m downstream), corresponding to 0.7 KDAR νµ per
proton-on-absorber, and a KDAR νµ cross section of
39 cm2/neutron, consistent with the CRPA pre-

power for diﬀerentiating between the various neutrino-
nucleus interaction models discussed.

The J-PARC Materials and Life Science Facility’s
(MLF) Spallation Neutron Source is host to another in-
tense source of monoenergetic KDAR νµ. The 3 GeV
proton beam is currently providing experiments power
at the 610 kW level, with a planned upgrade to 1 MW
in the near future. Given the suﬃcient beam energy,
high power, and therefore expected large KDAR signal
and low decay-in-ﬂight background, owing to the tar-
get being surrounded by concrete and iron, the J-PARC
MLF is one of the leading facilities in the world to study
KDAR neutrinos. The recently constructed JSNS2 ex-
periment at J-PARC MLF, a 50 ton (17 ton ﬁducial
volume) gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator (LS) neu-
trino detector located 24 m from the target, plans to
make precise measurements of KDAR neutrinos using an
estimated 30,000-50,000 KDAR νµ CC events on car-
bon collected over a 3 year data taking run [2, 58].
Given the distinct double coincidence signature of these
events in the light-based JSNS2 detector [(1) prompt
muon and hadronic-component light signal, followed by
(2) the muon decay electron light signal a few-µs later],
5 beam
the low beam-based background, and the
duty factor, the signal-to-background ratio is expected
to be highly favorable for a number of KDAR diﬀeren-
tial cross section measurements [58]. In particular, the
gadolinium-loaded, LS-based detector provides the abil-
ity to precisely reconstruct visible energy, which is closely
related to and can be used to approximate Tµ + Tp, and
the number of neutrons created in KDAR νµ CC interac-
tions, although isolating the muon is more diﬃcult since
the directional Cerenkov light information is drowned out
by the isotropic scintillation light. The few percent preci-
sion in visible energy reconstruction possible with JSNS2
may be able to provide a unique view of the missing en-
ergy distribution in the weak interaction, which could be
quite useful for neutrino interaction modeling, for exam-
ple. While not competitive in terms of statistics with
measurements of (e, e(cid:48)p), the charged-current neutrino
interaction brings complications not present in electron
scattering as the ﬁnal state does not have the same Z. As
a consequence, neutrino interaction models tend to use
eﬀective binding energies to account for e.g. Coulomb ef-
fects and diﬀerences in proton-neutron potentials which
are usually ﬁt to inclusive data. Precision measurements
in terms of visible energy can be used to study the accu-
racy of this modeling in detail. At the time of writing, the
JSNS2 experiment has started collecting neutrino beam

data with the complete detector [59, 60].

In general, future decay-at-rest sources featuring pro-
ton beam energies in excess of (cid:38)2-3 GeV can also serve
KDAR-based physics measurements. Two prominent ex-
amples of future high-power facilities that satisfy the pro-
ton energy requirement include the planned European

Spallation Source (ESS; 5-10 MW, 2.0
and a planned multi-MW facility upgrade at Fermilab
with a dedicated decay-at-rest component [62].

VI. APPLICATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR
NEUTRINO EXPERIMENTS

Above, we have discussed the modeling of the KDAR
νµ cross section, the inﬂuence of relevant nuclear eﬀects,
and prospects for future cross-section-speciﬁc measure-
ments. In this section, we discuss several applications of
a KDAR νµ source in direct oscillation measurements and
exotic searches. We also discuss how the constraints that
a measurement of KDAR neutrinos will provide can help
the analyses of current and future neutrino experimental
data. As an example, below we discuss how a KDAR
measurement could inform the analysis of the few-100-
MeV electron-like excess found in MiniBooNE, speciﬁ-
cally the cross section modeling in the signal region, as
the relevant phase space overlaps signiﬁcantly with that
which is probed in KDAR νµ CC interactions.

A. Electron appearance from a KDAR source

In principle, a 236 MeV νµ KDAR source has the po-
tential to probe the anomalous LSND and MiniBooNE
νe)
signals in an electron appearance experiment (νµ →
as in Ref. [63].
In this section, we investigate the sig-
nal and background for such a setup with the CRPA
cross sections. The envisioned setup, dedicated to creat-
ing and detecting KDAR neutrinos, consists of a 2 kton
LArTPC detector at a distance of 160 m set in the op-
posite direction of the 8 GeV Booster Neutrino Beam at
Fermilab, with all protons directed onto a large copper-
based absorber. The main irreducible background that is
considered comes from νe that are produced in decays of
stopped kaons via K +
e+π0νe), which have an
energy distribution that extends to just below 236 MeV.
In Ref. [63], a LArTPC is proposed in order to measure
the outgoing electrons and protons in νe CCQE events
in order to reconstruct the incoming neutrino energy.
While a LArTPC in a monochromatic neutrino beam
shows great potential to study the exclusive ﬁnal state,
the reliance on using the outgoing nucleon to reconstruct
the energy leads to severe modeling complications in the
kinematic regime under consideration. For example, a
model has to be able to reliably describe the missing en-
ergy distribution of argon which is a hidden variable that
enters in the energy balance. It is also well established
that the plane wave impulse approximation breaks down

e3 (K +

in which the electron and proton have to be measured in
coincidence–one would perhaps expect that by introduc-
ing this additional complication, the magnitude of the
signal (and background) would drop considerably as the
proton can go undetected for many reasons.

B.

Informing electron appearance in MiniBooNE

The MiniBooNE experiment has reported an anoma-
lous excess of electron-like events, possibly indicative of
νe appearance, in a νµ beam in reconstructed energy bins
of 200
475 MeV [65, 66]. The analysis of the excess in
terms of constraining the ﬂux and interpreting the data
in any oscillation scenario relies on neutrino cross section
modeling, including the ratio of the νe and νµ cross sec-
tions in terms of real and reconstructed energies. The
reconstructed energy Eν is deﬁned as

where the νµ is from KDAR and the background νe is from

e3, given the assumptions of Ref. [63]. The rate for the
signal and background have both been computed using the
CRPA cross section.

in this kinematic regime where q < 300 MeV. There-
fore great care has to be taken in describing the nuclear
matrix element by using a suitable (complex) potential.
This description falls outside the scope of the present
work, but instead we look at how a similar measurement
could be performed by only considering the outgoing lep-
ton kinematics. In Fig. 14 we show the expected electron
energy distribution using the same assumptions made in
Ref. [63], although here no cuts are made in the phase
space. The results are very similar to what is expected by
using a reconstruction method based on a simultaneous
measurement of the outgoing proton, but with the ad-
vantage that the underlying missing energy distribution
and speciﬁc details of the interaction beyond the inclu-
sive cross section do not have to be known in great detail.
In such an experiment the measurement of the abundant
(νµ, µ−p) signal could be used to constrain the modeling
of these nuclear structure details. We have also checked
that the reconstructed neutrino energy, as employed in
accelerator-based experiments that can only measure the
outgoing lepton energy, provides no clear separation be-
tween the signal and background in this case as the distri-
bution of both the signal and background are spread out
too broadly. It should also be clear from these consider-
ations that an excellent energy resolution and knowledge
of the background signal is necessary for such a measure-
ment. Lastly, it is interesting to note that the number of
events of both the background and the signal obtained
here match to a great extent with the results in Ref. [63]

With Mp the proton and Mn the neutron mass, this cor-
responds to the energy of a neutrino that produces a
charged lepton of mass ml with energy El and scatter-
ing angle θl with respect to the neutrino direction on a
stationary nucleon. Here a correction for the binding en-
EB,
ergy of the nucleon is introduced in M (cid:48)n = Mn −
with EB a ﬁxed average binding energy. The cross sec-
tion, and the νµ to νe ratio, is model-dependent, espe-
cially for low-energy neutrinos where the treatment of
Pauli-blocking, binding energy, and long-range correla-
tions is crucial, and diﬀerent models give varying predic-
tions [53, 67–70].

To illustrate the energy region to which the Mini-
BooNE analysis is sensitive we take the reported best-ﬁt
two-neutrino oscillation parameters sin2 2θ = 0.918 and
∆m2 = 0.041 eV2 in order to characterize the ﬂux. Given
these parameters we then obtain the νe ﬂux as

Φνe (Eν) = sin2 2θ sin

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

∆m2 L
Eν

˜Φνµ (Eν) ,

(20)

where ˜Φνµ is the normalized νµ ﬂux [24] and for sim-
plicity, we assume a single baseline of L = 540 m. This
ﬂux thus represents the number of νe per νµ per unit of
energy. In Fig. 15 we show the ﬂux-averaged cross sec-
tions at low reconstructed energy given these oscillation
parameters. We also show the results for a reported al-
lowed point within 1σ of the best ﬁt, which is used as an
example in Ref. [65] (sin2 2θ = 0.01, ∆m2 = 0.4 eV2).
We focus on the region 200 MeV < Eν < 400 MeV as
the number of observed events in this kinematic region is
still signiﬁcantly larger than the best-ﬁt 3+1 oscillation
scenario. Notably, this excess resides in the most forward
scattering bin and for low visible energy [66]. Overall, the
CRPA and RFG results agree well for the total strength
for both ﬂuxes. This happens because the strength lost

FIG. 15. Flux-averaged cross sections in terms of reconstructed energies for the MiniBooNE νe ﬂux from νµ → νe oscillations.
The best-ﬁt oscillation scenario point (left) and an example point within 1σ of the best ﬁt (right) are shown. The contributions
from diﬀerent energy bins are shown separately, with the vertical line representing the analysis threshold of Eν = 200 MeV.
Here the binding energy used in the deﬁnition of the reconstructed energy is taken to be 34 MeV to match with the value used
in the MiniBooNE analysis [64]. The dashed lines correspond to a RFG model with a binding energy of 34 MeV while in the
dotted lines 25 MeV is used, i.e. the former consistent with the reconstructed energy and the latter using the average binding
energy of the CRPA model. All the CRPA and RFG calculations use the same value for the axial mass of MA = 1.05 GeV.

in the RFG at lower neutrino energy is recovered in the
next, adjacent energy bin(s).

In Fig. 15, one sees that the low incoming neutrino
energy regions, in particular 200-300 MeV (mainly char-
acterized by CCQE interactions), dominate the signal
in which the largest MiniBooNE data excess is found.
KDAR νµ cross section measurements (236 MeV) can
therefore provide important constraints on the νµ and νe
CCQE cross sections in this essential region of low true
and reconstructed energy. We ﬁrst consider the νµ cross
section that in the experimental analysis is constrained
by measurements of the CC νµ signal in the MiniBooNE
detector. The νµ ﬂux peaks around Eν = 600 MeV with
a signiﬁcant high-energy tail, and the measured cross sec-
tion is therefore mostly sensitive to the “genuine” quasi-
elastic process and multinucleon emission characteristic
of these energies. The description of the νµ event rate in
the MiniBooNE analysis is naturally most accurate in the
region where the event rate is the largest, namely for E
between 0.5 and 1.2 GeV. Analysis of the KDAR νµ cross
section could thus signiﬁcantly improve the modeling for
lower (reconstructed) energies to which the νe signal is
sensitive. For example, the KDAR νµ cross section can
provide insight in the treatment of Pauli blocking which
is empirically increased in the MiniBooNE analysis in or-
der to better ﬁt the data [64]. Moreover, purely CCQE

scattering in the low E bins can be examined without the
complicating contributions from multinucleon knockout
and other processes arising from higher energy νµ [71–
74].

For the νe cross section, there is a signiﬁcant over-
lap in the accessible phase space for KDAR νµ scatter-
ing, as shown in Fig. 16. As previously explained, the
cross section factorizes into terms that are products of,
in principle well-known, leptonic prefactors and the nu-
clear responses. The nuclear responses do not depend
on the mass of the ﬁnal state lepton but only on ω and
q, the energy and momentum transfer to the nucleus re-
spectively. Therefore a comparison of the νµ cross section
with KDAR data in terms of ω and q also provides impor-
tant insight into the νe cross section. A combined analy-
sis of KDAR νµ data and the available (e, e(cid:48)) data in this
kinematic region with a nuclear model that treats these
processes consistently would be able to more strongly
constrain the inclusive cross section in the relevant kine-
matic region and thus improve the understanding of the
MiniBooNE anomaly.

C. Other KDAR applications

In addition to the experiments poised to provide
KDAR cross section measurements, including JSNS2, Mi-
croBooNE, and ICARUS (discussed above), there are a
number of proposed oscillation and exotic search exper-
iments and measurements which will rely on KDAR νµ
νe oscillations) and the pre-
and KDAR νe (from νµ →
dicted kinematics of the events for separating signal and
background. These are presented brieﬂy below. As usual,
the sensitivity of these searches, the systematic uncer-
tainties in the actual analyses, and the optimized design
of such experiments/analyses, will be highly dependent
on robust predictions for the neutrino-nucleus scattering
and the resulting experimental observable signals. The
CRPA predictions outlined here, in particular in terms
of lepton kinematics (see Fig. 17) can be used to reliably
model and simulate KDAR events in all of these cases.
Along with the possibility of looking for KDAR νµ →
νe oscillations at short baseline (discussed above), there is
νe
also a proposal to search for long-baseline KDAR νµ →
oscillations in the context of “standard” 3-neutrino oscil-
lations [75]. This proposal considers the 3 GeV J-PARC
Spallation Neutron Source at the MLF (also utilized by
the JSNS2 experiment, discussed above) for KDAR pro-
duction and the future water-based Hyper-K [76] as the
detector, separated by 295 km. Although the δCP mea-
surement resolution with such a conﬁguration will not
be competitive with future long-baseline experiments,
given the low expected event rate from the isotropic neu-
trino source at long distance, the relevant L/E parameter
space (or rather “point”, since the single-E = 236 MeV
neutrinos will travel a known-L = 295 km) is as-yet-
unexplored. Indeed, a study of 3-ν oscillations at a sin-
gle, unambiguous L/E point will be unprecedented and
can help rule out a number of exotic scenarios such as
neutrino decay and non-standard interactions (NSI) as
explanations for any possible “expected” 3-ν oscillation
signal. In general, such a measurement would be highly
complementary to conventional long-baseline-based de-
terminations of the mass hierarchy and/or δCP .

In addition, there is a proposal to search for KDAR
νµ disappearance at short-baseline called “KPIPE” [77],
which will also rely on the 3 GeV J-PARC Spallation
Neutron Source for KDAR neutrinos as well. This ex-
periment will study the rate of KDAR νµ events as a
function of distance using a long pipe of liquid scintil-
lator (diameter=3 m and length=120 m, with the up-
stream end 32 m from the neutrino source), oriented ra-
dially outward from the source. A rate measurement that
deviates from the expected 1/r2 behavior would be an in-
dication of new physics, perhaps coming from oscillations
involving a sterile neutrino at high-∆m2. Predictions for
the kinematics of the signal KDAR νµ-on-carbon-induced
muons, which create a a double coincidence of light [(1)
from the initial muon and hadronic component ﬂash, and
(2) followed by the muon-decay-induced electron ﬂash a
few-µs later] in KDAR events will be essential for sepa-

cosmic ray muons expected in the surface-based detector
and fast neutrons originating from the beam itself.

Along with the proposed KDAR-based experiments
above, the DUNE far detector LArTPC [78] will be sen-
sitive to KDAR νµ events originating from dark annihi-
lation in the sun [79, 80]. The idea is that if dark mat-
ter annihilation in the Sun’s core produces light quarks
at substantial levels, a signiﬁcant ﬂux of stopped-pion
and kaon-induced neutrinos will be created. In this case,
νe)
dark-matter-induced KDAR νµ (and oscillated νµ →
may be present at Earth. In separating signal from back-
ground, which mainly comes from the broad spectrum
atmospheric neutrino interactions, in terms of both en-
ergy and direction, this technique is reliant on the abil-
ity to precisely reconstruct both the energy and direc-
tion of KDAR νµ events using the ultra-large DUNE
LArTPC. As discussed in the relevant references out-
lining this idea, robust kinematic predictions for KDAR
neutrino-on-argon interactions are essential for estimat-
ing the search sensitivity and building up the eventual
analysis.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Monoenergetic 236 MeV muon neutrinos from charged
kaon decay-at-rest (KDAR) provide a unique opportu-
nity to probe the neutrino-nucleus interaction with an
unprecedented rigor. In the near future, a number of ex-
isting and planned experiments, e.g. MicroBooNE and
ICARUS at FNAL and JSNS2 at J-PARC MLF, plan to
study known-energy KDAR neutrino scattering oﬀ nu-
clei. To this end, we presented a detailed account of the
cross section calculations of 236 MeV νµ scattering oﬀ
nuclei within a microscopic many-body theory approach.
Our approach starts from a Hartree-Fock picture of the
nuclear ground state where nucleons are bound in the
potential obtained self-consistently from a Skyrme in-
teraction. Thereby, we incorporate long-range nucleon-
nucleon correlations by means of a continuum random-
phase approximation (CRPA) framework, which is par-
ticularly important for the low energy part of the acces-
sible phase space.

First, we studied the phase-space in terms of energy
and momentum transferred to the nucleus probed by the
charged-current interactions of a 236 MeV νµ. A signiﬁ-
cant part of this phase space lies in the transition region
between low-energy nuclear excitations, sensitive to the
underlying nuclear structure, and the genuine quasielas-
tic region. We confronted our predictions with (e, e(cid:48))
cross section data on 12C and 40Ca in the kinematic re-

19

gion that overlaps with the one accessible in KDAR neu-
trino interactions. We demonstrated the capabilities of
the CRPA approach in describing the lower-energy (and
momentum) part of the phase space, sensitive to nuclear
structure details. A satisfactory description of (e, e(cid:48)) data
on both nuclei, for the kinematics of interest for this
work, validates our approach.

Cross section predictions for the 236 MeV νµ scatter-
ing oﬀ 12C and 40Ar, which are nuclear targets of interest
to a number of current and future experiments aiming
to utilize KDAR neutrinos are presented. We compared
CRPA predictions with the only available KDAR mea-
surement, a shape-only νµ-12C measurement performed
by the MiniBooNE collaboration, along with the predic-
tions of a number of theoretical models and generators.
We studied Coulomb corrections with the MEMA ap-
proach, which are non-negligible at the neutrino energy
of interest. Naturally, Coulomb corrections are larger in
argon than in carbon. We then presented the decompo-
sition of the diﬀerential cross sections into longitudinal
and transverse, and axial and vector components, ﬁnd-
ing that the backward cross section is dominated by the
axial current. We also presented a decomposition of the
cross section into multipoles. Higher order multipoles
constitute a signiﬁcantly larger relative contribution to
the argon cross section than in carbon.

Finally, we discussed future prospects of precision
KDAR cross section measurements and implications for
current and future experiments that will utilize KDAR,
including direct oscillation measurements and exotic
searches.
In particular, we discussed how precise mea-
surements of KDAR νµ-nucleus interactions could pro-
vide powerful constraints on cross section models in the
energy regime where MiniBooNE observes an excess of
electron-like events. Such measurements could also help
constrain the νe-to-νµ ratio at lower energies, where the
mass of the lepton in the ﬁnal state aﬀects the accessible
phase space considerably, and theoretical predictions are
found to be model-dependent.

The KDAR νµ-nucleus diﬀerential cross section predic-
tions presented in this work can serve as an input towards
providing a robust simulation of KDAR signal events for
a variety of experiments.
