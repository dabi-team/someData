Abstract: An in-situ calibration of a logarithmic periodic dipole antenna with a frequency cover-
age of 30 MHz to 80 MHz is performed. Such antennas are part of a radio station system used for
detection of cosmic ray induced air showers at the Engineering Radio Array of the Pierre Auger
Observatory, the so-called Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA). The directional and frequency
characteristics of the broadband antenna are investigated using a remotely piloted aircraft carrying
a small transmitting antenna. The antenna sensitivity is described by the vector eﬀective length
relating the measured voltage with the electric-ﬁeld components perpendicular to the incoming
signal direction. The horizontal and meridional components are determined with an overall uncer-
tainty of 7.4+0.9
−1.7 % respectively. The measurement is used to correct a simulated
response of the frequency and directional response of the antenna. In addition, the inﬂuence of the
ground conductivity and permittivity on the antenna response is simulated. Both have a negligible
inﬂuence given the ground conditions measured at the detector site. The overall uncertainties of
the vector eﬀective length components result in an uncertainty of 8.8+2.1
−1.3 % in the square root of the
energy ﬂuence for incoming signal directions with zenith angles smaller than 60◦.

Introduction

When ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) hit the Earth, they collide with air nuclei and create
a particle cascade of millions of secondary particles, a so-called air shower. The atmosphere acts
thereby as a giant calorimeter of ∼11 hadronic interaction lengths. Instrumentation of such a giant
detector volume is challenging in every respect, especially concerning readout, calibration and
monitoring. Well-established solutions are stochastic measurements of the remaining secondary
particles at ground level and direct detection of ﬂuorescence light emitted from air molecules excited
by the particle cascade. Both techniques are successfully applied in the Pierre Auger Observatory in
Argentina, covering 3000 km2 with 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors and 27 telescopes for detection
of ﬂuorescence light [1].
In recent years, measurement of radio emission from air showers in the megahertz (MHz) regime
has become a complementary detection technique [2–8]. For this, the Pierre Auger Observatory
was extended by 153 radio stations, the so-called Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA). These
antenna stations at ground level provide information on the radio signal and are used to reconstruct
the electric ﬁeld generated by an air shower.
Two mechanisms contribute to coherent radio emission from air showers, namely the geomagnetic
eﬀect induced by charged particle motion in the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld [2, 9–13] and the time
varying negative charge excess in the shower front. The charge excess is due to the knock-out of
electrons from air molecules and annihilation of positrons in the shower front [14–18]. The radio
emission can be calculated from ﬁrst principles using classical electrodynamics [19–22]. The emis-
sion primarily originates from the well-understood electromagnetic part of the air shower. Thus,
the theoretical aspect of radio measurements is on solid grounds [7].
As the atmosphere is transparent to radio waves, the radio technique has a high potential for preci-
sion measurements in cosmic-ray physics. Correlation of the strength of the radio signal with the
primary cosmic-ray energy has meanwhile been demonstrated by several observatories [23–27].
Furthermore, the radiation energy, i.e., the energy contained in the radio signal has been determined
[27]. It was shown that the radio energy resolution is competitive with the results of particle mea-
surements at ground level. Furthermore using above-mentioned ﬁrst-principle calculations, a novel
way of a stand-alone absolute energy calibration of the atmospheric calorimeter appears feasible
[26].
In all these considerations, the antenna to detect the electric ﬁeld and a thorough description of its
characteristics is of central importance. Precise knowledge of the directional antenna characteristics
is essential to reconstruct the electric ﬁeld and therefore enables high quality measurements of the
cosmic-ray properties. For a complete description of the antenna characteristics an absolute antenna
calibration needs to be performed. The uncertainties of the absolute calibration directly impact the
energy scale for air shower measurements from radio detectors. Therefore, a central challenge of
the absolute antenna calibration is to reduce the uncertainties of the antenna characteristics to the
level of 10 % which is a signiﬁcant improvement in comparison with the uncertainties obtained in
calibration campaigns at other radio detectors [28–30].
In this work, the reconstruction quality of the electric-ﬁeld signal from the measured voltage trace,
which includes the directional characteristics of the antenna and dispersion of the signal owing to
the antenna size, is investigated. All information are described with the vector eﬀective length (cid:174)H,

– 2 –

a complex measure that relates the measured voltage to the incoming electric ﬁeld. One antenna
of the subset of 24 radio stations equipped with logarithmic periodic dipole antennas (LPDAs) is
investigated here exemplarily. This antenna is representative of all the LPDAs which are mechani-
cally and electrically identical at the percent level [31]. While the low-noise ampliﬁer attached to
the antenna was included in the signal chain during the calibration, ampliﬁers and the subsequent
electronics of all radio stations have been characterized individually. The LPDA antennas have the
advantage of low sensitivity to radio waves reﬂecting from the ground which makes them largely
independent of potentially changing ground conditions.
The LPDA antennas have been studied before and a ﬁrst absolute calibration of one signal polariza-
tion was performed in 2012 giving an overall systematic uncertainty of 12.5 % [32]. In comparison
to the ﬁrst absolute calibration of AERA, in this paper a new absolute calibration is presented using
a new setup enabling a much more dense sampling of the arrival directions, more ﬁeld polarization
measurements, and an extended control of systematic eﬀects including the full repetition of calibra-
tion series. To ensure far-ﬁeld measurements, instead of the previously used balloon, a drone was
employed, carrying a separate signal generator and a calibrated transmitting antenna.
This work is structured as follows. Firstly, a calculation of the absolute value of the vector eﬀective
length | (cid:174)H| of the LPDA is presented. Then, the LPDA antenna and the calibration setup are spec-
iﬁed. In the next section the calibration strategy is presented using one example ﬂight where | (cid:174)H|
is measured on site at the Pierre Auger Observatory at one of the radio stations. The main section
contains detailed comparisons of all the measurements with the calculated vector eﬀective length
and the determination of the uncertainties in the current understanding of the antenna. Finally, the
inﬂuence of the calibration results are discussed in applications before presenting the conclusions.

2 Antenna Response Pattern

This section gives a theoretical overview of the antenna response pattern. The vector eﬀective length
(VEL) is introduced as a measure of the directional dependent antenna sensitivity. Furthermore, it
is explained how the VEL is obtained for an uncalibrated antenna. For more details refer to [32].

2.1 The Vector Eﬀective Length (VEL)

Electromagnetic ﬁelds induce a voltage at the antenna output. The antenna signal depends on
the incoming ﬁeld (cid:174)E(t), the contributing frequencies f , as well as on the incoming direction with
the azimuthal angle Φ and the zenith angle Θ to the antenna. The relation between the Fourier-
transformed electric ﬁeld (cid:174)E( f ) and the Fourier transformed observed voltage U for Φ, Θ, f
is
referred to as the antenna response pattern and is expressed in terms of the VEL (cid:174)H:

U(Φ, Θ, f ) = (cid:174)H(Φ, Θ, f ) · (cid:174)E( f )

(2.1)

The VEL (cid:174)H is oriented in the plane perpendicular to the arrival direction of the signal and can
be expressed as a superposition of a horizontal component Hφ and a component Hθ oriented
perpendicular to Hφ which is called meridional component:

(cid:174)H = Hφ (cid:174)eφ + Hθ (cid:174)eθ .

(2.2)

– 3 –

The VEL is a complex quantity Hk = |Hk |eiαk with k = φ, θ and accounts for the frequency-
dependent electrical losses within the antenna as well as reﬂection eﬀects which arise in the case of
diﬀerences between the antenna and read-out system impedances. Both eﬀects lead to dispersion
of the signal shape.
The antenna response pattern is often expressed in terms of the antenna gain based on the directional
dependence of the received power. With the quadratic relation between voltage and power, the
antenna gain and the absolute value of the VEL are related by:

|Hk(Φ, Θ, f )|2 = c2ZR
f 24πZ0

2.2 Calculating the Absolute Value of the VEL from a Transmission Measurement

The antenna characteristics of an uncalibrated antenna under test (AUT) is determined by measuring
the antenna response of the AUT in a transmission setup using a calibrated transmission antenna. The
relation between transmitted and received power is described by the Friis equation [33] considering
the free-space path loss in vacuum as well as the signal frequency:

2.3 Calculating the Absolute Value of the Antenna VEL with separate Ampliﬁer from a

Transmission Simulation

In this work, the NEC-2 [34] simulation code is used to simulate the response pattern of the passive
part of the AUT. With the passive part of the AUT the antenna without a then following low-noise
ampliﬁer stage is meant. These simulations provide information about the received voltage directly
at the antenna footpoint (AF) which is the location where the signals of all dipoles are collected
and converted to the then following 50 Ω system of the read-out system. In the case of an ampliﬁer
(AMP) connected to the AF, the voltage at the output of the AMP is the parameter of interest.
The AMP is connected to the AF using a transmission line (TL). Both, the AMP and the TL, then
constitute the active part of the AUT. In the simulation, mismatch and reﬂection eﬀects between the
AF, the TL and the AMP, which arise if the impedances Z j ( j = AF, TL, AMP) of two connected
components diﬀer from each other, have to be considered separately. Moreover, the attenuation of

– 4 –

the TL with a cable length lT L as well as the AMP itself described by the AMP S-parameters have to
be taken into account. The transformation of the received voltage at the AF to the received voltage
at the AMP output is described by the transfer function ρ:

3 Logarithmic Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA)

In this section, the Logarithmic Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA) which is used in a subset of
the radio stations of AERA is presented. An LPDA consists of several λ/2-dipoles of diﬀerent
lengths which are combined to one single antenna with the largest dipole located at the bottom and
the shortest dipole at the top of the LPDA. The sensitive frequency range is deﬁned by the length
of the smallest lmin and largest lmax dipole. The ratio of the distance between two dipoles and
their size is described by σ and the ratio of the dipole length between two neighboring dipoles is
denoted by τ. The four design parameters of the LPDAs used at AERA are τ = 0.875, σ = 0.038,
lmin = 1470 mm and lmax = 4250 mm. These values were chosen to cover the frequency range from
around 30 MHz to 80 MHz and to combine a high antenna sensitivity in a broad ﬁeld of view using
a limited number of dipoles and reasonable dimensions. They lead to a LPDA with nine separate
dipoles. For more details refer to [32]. A full drawing of the LPDA used at AERA including all sizes
is shown in Fig. 1. Each radio station at AERA consists of two perpendicular polarized antennas
which are aligned to magnetic north with a precision better than 1◦. The dipoles are connected to
a waveguide with the footpoint at the top of the antenna. The footpoint is connected by an RG58
[35] coaxial transmission line to a low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) which ampliﬁes the signal typically
by (18.1 ± 0.2) dB. The LNA of the radio station and used in the calibration setup ampliﬁes the
signal by 18.1 dB. The ampliﬁcation is nearly constant in the frequency range 30 MHz to 80 MHz
and variates at the level of 0.5 dB. For more technical details about the LNA refer to [36].

4 Calibration Setup

The antenna VEL of the LPDA is determined by transmitting a deﬁned signal from a calibrated
signal source from diﬀerent arrival directions and measuring the LPDA response. The signal source
consists of a signal generator, producing known signals, and a calibrating transmitting antenna with
known emission characteristics. The transmission measurement needs to be done in the far-ﬁeld
region, which is fulﬁlled to a reasonable approximation at a distance of R > 2λ = 20 m for the
LPDA frequency range of 30 MHz to 80 MHz.
In a ﬁrst calibration campaign [32] a large weather balloon was used to lift the transmitting antenna
and a cable to the signal source placed on ground. As a vector network analyzer was used to provide

– 5 –

Figure 1. Drawing of the Logarithmic Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA), units are millimeter.

the source and to measure the AUT output this transmission measurement allowed to determine
both, the VEL magnitude and phase. This setup has the disadvantages that it requires calm weather
conditions and the cost per ﬂight including the balloon and gas are high. Moreover, the cable
potentially impacts the measurements if not properly shielded. In this ﬁrst calibration campaign
only the horizontal VEL was investigated. A new calibration campaign was necessary and a new
setup was developed.
Now, a signal generator as well as a transmission antenna were both mounted beneath a ﬂying
drone, a so-called remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), to position the calibration source. Hence, the
cable from ground to the transmitting antenna is not needed anymore. Furthermore, the RPA is
much less dependent on wind, and thus it is easier to perform the measurement compared to the
balloon-based calibration. The new calibration is performed with a higher repetition rate and with
more positions per measurement.
During the measurement, the RPA ﬂies straight up to a height of more than 20 m and then towards
the AUT until it is directly above it. Finally, it ﬂies back and lands again at the starting position. A
sketch of the setup is shown at the top of Fig. 2.

The RPA used here was an octocopter obtained from the company MikroKopter [37]. Such an
octocopter also has been used for the ﬂuorescence detector [38] and CROME [39] calibrations.

radiated by a transmitting antenna. Both the signal generator and the transmitting antenna are attached
underneath a ﬂying drone, a so-called RPA, to realize far-ﬁeld conditions during the measurement. On arrival
of the signal at the LPDA, the antenna response is measured using a spectrum analyzer. The orientation of
the RPA is described by the yaw (twist of front measured from north in the mathematically negative direction),
and the tilt by the pitch and the roll angles. (bottom) Sketch of the expected (blue arrow) and measured (red
arrow) electric ﬁeld polarization at the LPDA emitted by the transmitting antenna from the nominal (blue)
and measured (red) position. The real transmitting antenna position is shifted from the nominal position,
e.g., due to GPS accuracy. This misplacement changes the electric-ﬁeld strength and polarization measured
at the LPDA and, therefore, inﬂuences the measurement.

– 7 –

The horizontal octocopter position is measured by GPS and a barometer provides information
about the height above ground. Both are autonomously recorded nearly each second which enables
measurements of the VEL with good resolution in zenith angle Θ. To obtain further improvements
of the octocopter position determination an optical method using two cameras taking pictures of
the ﬂight was developed. The cameras are placed on orthogonal axes with a distance of around
100 m to the AUT. Canon Ixus 132 cameras [40] with a resolution of 16 MegaPixel are utilized.
They are set to an autonomous mode where they take pictures every three seconds. From these
pictures the full ﬂight path of the octocopter can be reconstructed. The method is explained in detail
in [41, 42]. Beside the octocopter position, information about rotation angles (yaw, pitch, roll as
deﬁned in Fig. 2) are recorded during the ﬂight which are later used to determine the orientation of
the transmission antenna with respect to the AUT.
The position of the LPDA station was measured by a diﬀerential GPS (DGPS) (Hiper V system
[43]) and is therefore known with centimeter accuracy.
The reference spectrum generator, model RSG1000 produced by the company TESEQ [44], is used
as the signal generator. It continuously produces a frequency comb spectrum between 5 MHz and
1000 MHz with a spacing of 5 MHz. This signal is further ampliﬁed in order to accomplish power
well above background for the measurement using the LPDA. The output signal injected into the
transmission antenna has been measured twice in the lab using a FSH4 spectrum analyzer from the
company Rohde&Schwarz [45] and using an Agilent N9030A ESA spectrum analyzer [46] both
with a readout impedance of 50 Ω.
In an eﬀort to maintain the strict 2.5 kg octocopter payload limit, a small biconical antenna from
Schwarzbeck (model BBOC 9217 [47]) is mounted 0.7 m beneath the octocopter. This antenna
has been calibrated by the manufacturer in the frequency range from 30 MHz to 1000 MHz with an
accuracy of 0.5 dB. This response pattern and its uncertainty comprise all mismatch eﬀects when
connecting a 50 Ω signal source to such a transmitting antenna. The power received at the LPDA
during the calibration procedure is measured using the same FSH4 spectrum analyzer as above.
The diﬀerent VEL components mentioned in Eq. (2.2) are determined by performing multiple ﬂights
in which the orientation of the transmitting antenna is varied with respect to the AUT. Sketches of the
antenna orientations during the ﬂights are shown on the left side of Fig. 3. The horizontal component
|Hφ | of the LPDA is measured in the LPDA main axis perpendicular to the LPDA orientation. Then,
both antennas are aligned in parallel for the whole ﬂight. The meridional component |Hθ | is split into
two subcomponents: The other horizontally but perpendicular to (cid:174)eφ oriented component |Hθ,hor|
and the vertical component |Hθ,vert|. As the orientation of the transmission antennas is the main
diﬀerence between both measurements, the phase αk with k = (θ, hor), (θ, vert) is the same. Then,
these two subcomponents are combined to the meridional component |Hθ |:

|Hθ | = cos(Θ)|Hθ,hor| + sin(Θ)|Hθ,vert|.

(4.1)

Both meridional subcomponents are measured in the axis perpendicular to the LPDA main axis.
Therefore, the transmission antenna needs to be rotated by 90◦ and the ﬂight path needs to start at
the 90◦ rotated position in comparison to the measurement of |Hφ |. For the case of the |Hθ,vert|
measurement the transmitting antenna is vertically aligned.
As the receiving power is measured directly at the output of the LPDA ampliﬁer, all matching

– 8 –

eﬀects from connecting a transmission line to the LPDA footpoint and the LPDA LNA are taken
into account. The VEL is calculated using Eq. (2.5).

5 Calibration Strategy

To explain the LPDA calibration strategy a measurement of each of the three VEL components is
presented. Several ﬂights at diﬀerent days with diﬀerent environmental conditions were performed
and ﬁnally combined to give an average LPDA VEL. Here, one of the measurements of each VEL
component is presented to show the reconstruction procedure as well as the statistical precision of
the measurements. Furthermore, the corrections taking into account cable damping, background
measurements, misalignments of the transmitting antenna and shift of the octocopter position are
discussed in detail. Afterwards, an overview of the measurement uncertainties is given.

5.1 Example Measurement

In the right diagrams of Fig. 3 the measured VEL components |Hφ |, |Hθ,hor| and |Hθ,vert| at the
output of the LPDA LNA as a function of the zenith angle Θ at 55 MHz are shown. In the left
drawings the respective antenna orientations are visible. The antenna response pattern reveals the
following features. For the VEL component |Hφ |, the LPDA is most sensitive in the zenith direction.
The pattern shows a side lobe at around 65◦. For |Hθ,hor| the most sensitive direction is the zenith
while at larger zenith angles the sensitivity is strongly reduced. At the zenith the components |Hφ |
and |Hθ,hor| are equal which is expected as the antenna orientations are identical. The ﬂuctuations
in |Hθ,hor| are larger than those in |Hφ | due to the larger dependencies on the octocopter rotations.
When ﬂying towards the antenna, any acceleration causes a rotation around the pitch angle (Fig. 2)
which does not inﬂuence |Hφ |. However, for both meridional subcomponents the pitch angle already
changes the transmitting antenna orientation (Fig. 3). Therefore, it inﬂuences both measurements.
In comparison to the other components |Hθ,vert| is much smaller. Therefore, the LPDA is marginally
sensitive to such a signal polarization especially at vertical incoming directions. All these results
are frequency dependent.

5.2 Corrections

For the raw VEL determined according to Eq. (2.5) corrections for the experimental conditions
have to be applied. The VEL is averaged in zenith angle intervals of 5◦. This is motivated by the
observed variations in the repeated measurements which were recorded on diﬀerent days (see e.g.
below Fig. 8). All corrections to the VEL are expressed relative to the measured raw VEL at a
zenith angle of (42.5 ± 2.5)◦ and a frequency of 55 MHz and are listed in Tab. 1. The corrections are
partly zenith angle and/or frequency dependent. The following paragraphs describe the corrections
of the raw VEL at the LPDA LNA output from the measurement.

5.2.1 Background Noise

During the calibration background noise is also recorded. In a separate measurement the frequency
spectrum of the background has been determined and is then subtracted from the calibration signal
spectrum. Typically, the background noise is several orders of magnitude below the signal strength.

factor of 3 to make both antennas visible. For clarity, the LPDA and the transmitting antenna (assumed as a

This is even the case for the component |Hθ,vert| with lowest LPDA sensitivity. For large zenith
angles close to 90◦ and in the case of the component |Hθ,vert| also for small zenith angles directly
above the radio station, however, the background noise and the signal can be of the same order of
magnitude. In this case, the calibration signal spectrum constitutes an upper limit of the LPDA
sensitivity. If more than 50 % of the events in a zenith angle bin of 5◦ are aﬀected, no background
is subtracted but half of the measured total signal is used for calculating the VEL and a 100%
systematic uncertainty on the VEL is assigned.

5.2.2 Cable Attenuation

To avoid crosstalk in the LPDA read-out system, the read-out system was placed at a distance
of about 25 m from the LPDA. The RG58 coaxial cable [35], used to connect the LPDA to the
read-out system, has a frequency-dependent ohmic resistance that attenuates the receiving power
by a frequency-dependent factor δ. To obtain the VEL at the LNA output the cable attenuation is
corrected from lab measurements using the FSH4.

5.2.3 Octocopter Inﬂuence

During the LPDA VEL measurement the transmitting antenna is mounted underneath the octocopter
which contains conductive elements and is powered electrically. Therefore, the octocopter itself
may change the antenna response pattern of the transmitting antenna with respect to the zenith
angle. To ﬁnd a compromise between signal reﬂections at the octocopter and stability during take
oﬀ, ﬂight and landing, the distance between transmitting antenna and octocopter has been chosen
to be 0.7 m. The inﬂuence has been investigated by simulating the antenna response pattern of
the transmitting antenna with and without mounting underneath an octocopter. It is found that the
average gain of the transmission antenna changes by 0.05 dB [48]. At a zenith angle of (42.5 ± 2.5)◦
and a frequency of 55 MHz the octocopter inﬂuences the transmitting antenna VEL with 0.6 %.

5.2.4 Octocopter Misalignments and Misplacements

Misalignments and misplacements of the octocopter during the calibration ﬂight have a direct
impact on the transmitting antenna position and orientation changing the signal polarization at the
position of the AUT. For this investigation the orientation of the transmission antenna is assumed
to correspond to a dipole, which holds to a good approximation. The electric ﬁeld (cid:174)Et emitted from
a dipole antenna with orientation ˆAt in the direction ˆn in the far-ﬁeld region is proportional to
(cid:174)Et ∼ ( ˆn × ˆAt ) × ˆn, and the amplitude is given by | (cid:174)Et | = sin(α). Here, α describes the smallest angle
between the transmitting antenna alignment ˆAt and the direction from the transmitting antenna to
the AUT denoted as ˆn (see lower sketch of Fig. 2). The orientation of the transmitting antenna ˆAt is
calculated by an intrinsic rotation of the initial orientation of the transmitting antenna rotating ﬁrst by
the yaw angle G, then by the pitch angle P and ﬁnally, by the roll angle R. The AUT sensitivity η to
the emitted electric ﬁeld is then calculated by the absolute value of the scalar product of the electric
ﬁeld and the AUT orientation ˆAr : η = | (cid:174)Et · ˆAr | = sin(α) cos(β) with β describing the smallest
angle between (cid:174)Et and ˆAr (see lower sketch of Fig. 2). Finally, the correction factor (cid:15) of the power
measured at the AUT is determined by the square of the quotient of the nominal and the real value of
η. In case of the horizontal component |Hφ | the VEL is systematically shifted to larger values for all
zenith angles and frequencies due to the octocopter misalignment and misplacement. The correction
factor (cid:15) is used to determine the horizontal VEL |Hφ |. In both meridional subcomponents the VEL
becomes small at large zenith angles and strongly dependent on the antenna alignments. Therefore,
in the meridional subcomponents |Hθ,hor| and |Hθ,vert| the eﬀects of the octocopter misalignment
and misplacement are included in the systematic uncertainties.

5.2.5 Octocopter Flight Height

The octocopter ﬂight height is determined by a barometer measuring the change of air pressure ∆p
during the ﬂight. The octocopter software assumes a linear dependency of ∆p and the octocopter
ﬂight height over ground hr aw. Two corrections have been applied to the raw ﬂight height. Firstly, it
was observed that the ﬂight height diﬀers at take oﬀ and landing. Therefore, a linear time dependent
correction is applied which constrains the ﬂight height over ground at take oﬀ and landing to zero.
Secondly, AERA is located at a height of about 1550 m above sea level. Therefore, such a linear
relation between ∆p and hr aw used by the octocopter software is not precise enough. A more
realistic calculation considering an exponential model of the barometric formula [49] as well as the
height and latitude dependent gravitation is used to determine the more precise octocopter height
hocto. An inverse quadratic relation between gravitation and the height above sea level with a value
at sea level of g(0) = 9.797 m
s2 at the latitude of AERA is taken into account. The raw octocopter
height as well as the height after all corrections of the |Hφ | example ﬂight are shown on the left side
of Fig. 4 in comparison to the octocopter height determined with the optical method. Both methods
agree at the level of 1.1 % in the median. The quotient of the octocopter height measured by the
camera method and by the full corrected barometer method is shown in the histogram on the right
side of Fig. 4. The optical method is used to correct for the small diﬀerence.

5.2.6 Octocopter Position Shift from Optical Method Position Reconstruction

While the octocopter position measured by the built-in sensors (air pressure, GPS) is recorded
nearly each second, the cameras used in the optical method take pictures of the ﬂight every 3 s.

electronics. The octocopter height determined by the optical method is denoted by the red dots. All

corrected barometer height and measured height from the optical method.

Furthermore, it turned out that the ﬂuctuations of the built-in sensors are smaller in comparison to the
optical method. Nevertheless, the systematic uncertainties of the octocopter position reconstruction
using the optical method are still much smaller. The uncertainties are described in detail in the
following subsection. To combine both advantages of high statistics and small uncertainties, the
octocopter position measured by the built-in sensors is taken and then shifted towards the position
measured with the optical method. Therefore, the octocopter position in the XY-plane is shifted by
the median distance and the octocopter height measured by the barometer is shifted by the median
factor between both methods. For the |Hφ | example ﬂight the octocopter XY-position measured
by GPS is shifted by 0.83 m to the west and 3.22 m to the south. The full corrected ﬂight height
measured by the barometer is shifted by 1.1 %.

5.3 Uncertainties

In this subsection the statistical and systematic uncertainties are discussed using the |Hφ | example
ﬂight at a middle frequency of f = 55 MHz and a zenith angle bin of (Θ = 42.5±2.5) ◦ as mentioned
above. This zenith angle is chosen as most events at AERA are reconstructed coming from this
direction. While some systematic uncertainties are stable between ﬂights, e.g., measurement of
the power injected to the transmitting antenna or the transmitting antenna response pattern, others
are ﬂight dependent, e.g., the octocopter position and the measurement of the receiving power
at the AUT. The VEL relative uncertainties are listed in Tab. 2. These individual uncertainties
are described in detail in the following subsections. The constant systematic uncertainties add
quadratically to 6.3 % and the ﬂight dependent systematic uncertainty is 6.9 %.

the overall systematic uncertainty is the quadratic sum of each single systematic uncertainty, the overall
statistical uncertainty is described by the observed signal ﬂuctuation during the measurement. The statistical
uncertainty of each source of uncertainty describes the expected uncertainty, e.g., from the manufacturer’s
information.

5.3.1 Transmitting Antenna Position

The systematic uncertainty of the position reconstruction of the optical method was determined
by comparing the reconstructed octocopter position with the position measured by a DGPS which
gives an accurate position determination. The combined mass of the transmission antenna and the
additional DGPS exceeds the maximal payload capacity of the octocopter. Therefore, a separate
ﬂight with DGPS but without transmitting antenna and source generator was performed. The
octocopter positions measured with the optical method and the DGPS are compared in Fig. 5. The
systematic uncertainty of the octocopter position in the XY-plane is calculated using the quadratic
sum of both median values (red dashed lines) in the X and Y direction which is smaller than
1 m. Equally, the systematic uncertainty of the octocopter height is σh = 0.06 m. The inﬂuence
on the VEL is determined by shifting the reconstructed octocopter position by these uncertainties
and redoing the VEL calculation given in Eq. (2.5) of each zenith angle bin separately for the
XY-plane and the height. The VEL systematic uncertainty is given by half the diﬀerence of the
upper and lower shift of the VEL. The systematic uncertainty on the VEL at a zenith angle of
Θ = 42.5◦(2.5◦, 72.5◦) ± 2.5◦ due to the octocopter’s XY-position is 1.5 % (0.2 %, 2.9 %) and due

to the octocopter’s height is 0.1 % (0.2 %, < 0.1 %).
The statistical uncertainty of the octocopter’s built-in sensors is determined in the following way.
The ﬂight height measured by the barometer has to be corrected as described in section 5.2.5
which causes further uncertainties during the ﬂight. The statistical uncertainty of the octocopter
height measured with the barometer is then determined by comparing the measured height with
the height measured by the DGPS (lower right panel of Fig. 6). The statistical uncertainty are
found to be σ = 0.33 m which results in a 0.6 % uncertainty in the VEL. The horizontal position
uncertainties are determined in a measurement where the octocopter remains stationary on the

All these uncertainties are smaller than those of the optical method described by the widths of the
distributions shown in Fig. 5 where the octocopter positions measured with DGPS and the camera
method are compared.
The transmission antenna is mounted at a distance of sAnt = 0.7 m beneath the octocopter. Hence,
a tilt of the octocopter, described by the pitch and the roll angle, changes the position in the XY-plane
of the transmission antenna as well as its height over ground. In the case of the example ﬂight, the
average pitch (roll) angle of the octocopter is −0.6◦ (0.9◦) which lead to a systematic uncertainty
smaller than 0.1 % at 55 MHz and (42.5 ± 2.5) ◦.

The size of the LPDA in the z-direction is 1.7 m. The interaction point of the signal at each
frequency is set to the center of the LPDA. Therefore, there is a systematic uncertainty in the height
interval between transmitting antenna and AUT which is conservatively estimated to be 0.85 m. For
the example ﬂight, this systematic results in a VEL systematic uncertainty of 1.4 % at 55 MHz and
(42.5 ± 2.5) ◦.

5.3.3 Uniformity of Ground Height

The ground height above sea level at the octocopter starting position and at the LPDA is measured
by DGPS. The ground is not completely ﬂat but varies at the level of a few cm over a distance of
5 m which is incorporated as additional uncertainty on the height. The resulting inﬂuence on the
VEL is less than 0.1 %.

5.3.4 Emitted Signal towards the Antenna Under Test

The uncertainty of the emitted signal contains eﬀects from the power output of the RSG1000, the
injected power into the transmission antenna, the transmission response pattern, the inﬂuence of
the octocopter on the pattern as well as the misalignment and misplacement of the transmitting
antenna which changes the emitted power transmitted towards the AUT and lead to a twist of the
signal polarization at the AUT.
The manufacturer of the RSG1000 states a signal stability of 0.2 dB measured at a constant tem-
perature of 20 ◦ which results in a statistical uncertainty of 2.3 % in the VEL. The calibration
measurements were performed at temperatures between 15 ◦C and 25 ◦C. Here, the manufacturer
denotes a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 dB due to temperature shifts which results in 2.9 % in the
VEL.
The injected power from the RSG1000 to the transmission antenna is measured twice in the lab us-
ing the FSH4 spectrum analyzer averaged over 100 samples and a Agilent N9030A ESA spectrum
analyzer averaged over 1000 samples. The systematic uncertainty of the FSH4 measurement is
0.5 dB and the systematic uncertainty of the Agilent N9030A ESA measurement is 0.24 dB. Both
are combined yielding a total systematic uncertainty of 0.22 dB in the VEL. As there is a quadratic
relation between injected power and the VEL (refer to Eq. (2.5)) the systematic uncertainty on the
VEL is 2.5 %. The statistical uncertainties of these measurements are small due to the number of
samples and can be neglected.
The antenna manufacturer speciﬁes a systematic uncertainty of the transmitting antenna pattern of
0.5 dB which results in a systematic uncertainty on the VEL of 5.8 %. The inﬂuence of the octo-
copter on the transmission antenna pattern investigated with simulations is small [48] and, therefore,
a systematic uncertainty due to the octocopter inﬂuence on the transmission antenna pattern can be
neglected.
Misalignment and misplacement of the transmitting antenna lead to a twist of the signal polarization
and furthermore, altered the signal strength at the AUT. The AUT sensitivity to an electric ﬁeld
is given by η = sin(α) cos(β) with the angles α and β as described in section 5.2.4. Both angles,
and therefore η, depend on the octocopter rotation angles as well as on the octocopter position.
The angle β linearly depends on α and on the AUT orientation which is known with a precision

– 17 –

of 1◦. The uncertainty of all three octocopter rotation angles is estimated to be 1◦. In the case
of the horizontal VEL the uncertainty of α is described by the quadratic sum of two octocopter
rotation angles and the angle which arises from the octocopter position uncertainties as well as the
size of the AUT. For the example ﬂight, the resulting inﬂuence on the VEL is 0.4 % at 55 MHz and
(42.5 ± 2.5) ◦. In contrast, both meridional subcomponents are not corrected for the octocopter mis-
alignment and misplacement. Here, the octocopter misalignment and misplacement is completely
included in the systematic uncertainty. Therefore, the systematic uncertainty of the VEL due to an
octocopter misalignment and misplacement is larger for both meridional subcomponents than in
the case of the horizontal component. The systematic uncertainty on the VEL is calculated in the
same way but using the nominal values of α and β in each zenith angle bin of 5◦ instead. As β
linearly depends on α, only a further uncertainty on α given by the diﬀerence between the measured
median values and nominal values of α is needed, quadratically added and then propagated to the
systematic uncertainty on the VEL. In case of both meridional subcomponents, both angles α and
β depend on the zenith angle. Hence, this systematic uncertainty is strongly zenith angle dependent
for both meridional subcomponents.
The uncertainties of the injected power to the transmitting antenna and the transmitting antenna
In comparison to other calibration campaigns at
pattern limit the overall calibration accuracy.
LOFAR or Tunka-Rex, a RSG1000 were used as signal source as well but a diﬀerent transmitting
antenna. Both RSG1000 signal sources diﬀer on a percent level only. However, the manufac-
turer of the transmitting antenna used at LOFAR and Tunka-Rex states a systematic uncertainty
of the transmitting antenna pattern of 1.25 dB [50]. Hence, the AERA calibration has a signiﬁ-
cantly smaller systematic uncertainty due to the more precise calibration of the transmitting antenna.

5.3.5 Received Signal at the Antenna Under Test

Within the uncertainty of the received signal all uncertainty eﬀects of the received power at the
AUT including the full signal chain from the LPDA to the spectrum analyzer as well as the LNA
and cables are considered.
In the following a drift of the LPDA LNA gain due to temperature
ﬂuctuations, the uncertainty of the received power using the FSH4 and the inﬂuence of background
noise as well as the uncertainty of the cable attenuation measurements are discussed.
The LPDA LNA gain depends on the temperature. The gain temperature drift was measured in
the laboratory and was determined to 0.01 dB/K using the FSH4 in the vector network analyzer
mode [48]. The calibration measurements were performed at temperatures between 15 ◦C and
25 ◦C which results in a systematic uncertainty of 1 % in the VEL due to temperature drifts of the
LNA. The measurements of the LPDA LNA gain due to temperature ﬂuctuations using the FSH4
show ﬂuctuations of the LNA gain at the level of 0.1 dB which results in an expected statistical
uncertainty of 0.6 % in the VEL.
The event power is measured using the FSH4 spectrum analyzer. The manufacturer states a
systematic uncertainty of 0.5 dB. The systematic uncertainty in the VEL is then 5.8 %. Also
the background noise is measured using the FSH4 in spectrum analyzer mode. The systematic
0.5
uncertainty of the VEL considering event power (P) and background noise (B) is
2 dB. If
the background noise is of the same order of magnitude as the measured event power for more than

(cid:113) P2+B2
P2−B2

– 18 –

50 % of events in a 5◦ zenith angle bin, the systematic uncertainty for this zenith angle bin is set
to 100 %. For the example ﬂight, the systematic due to background noise results in an additional
VEL systematic uncertainty of 0.4 % at 55 MHz and (42.5 ± 2.5) ◦. A further background inﬂuence
on the measured signal at the LPDA due to the communication between the remote control and
the octocopter is not expected, as they communicate at 2.4 GHz and the LPDA is sensitive in the
frequency range from 30 MHz to 80 MHz.
The attenuation of the cable is measured with the FSH4 in network analyzer mode transmitting a
signal with a power of 0 dBm and averaged over 100 samples. Therefore, the statistical uncertainty
can be neglected. The manufacturer states a systematic uncertainty of 0.04 dB for transmission
measurements with a transmission higher than −20 dB which applies in case of the cables. This
results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.5 % in the VEL.

5.4 Simulation of the Experimental Setup

The calibration measurement is simulated using the NEC-2 simulation code. Here, the AUT, the
transmission antenna and realistic ground properties are taken into account. At standard ground
conditions the ground conductivity is set to be 0.0014 S/m which was measured at the AERA
site. Values of the conductivity of dry sand, which is the typical ground consistency at AERA, are
reported here [13, 51]. Measurements of the ground permittivity at the AERA site yield values
between 2 and 10 depending on the soil wetness [48]. The standard ground permittivity is set to
be 5.5 in the simulation. The distance between both antennas is set to be 30.3 m. The VEL is
calculated using Eq. (2.5) modiﬁed with Eq. (2.6) considering the manufacturer information for the
response pattern of the transmitting antenna as well as the transfer function from the AUT output
to the system consisting of the transmission line from the LPDA footpoint to the LNA and the LNA
itself. To investigate the simulation stability several simulations with varying antenna separations
and changing ground conditions were performed [48]. Antenna separations ranging from 25 m to
50 m were simulated and did not change the resulting VEL of the LPDA. Hence, the simulation
conﬁrms that the measurement is being done in the far-ﬁeld region. Furthermore, the inﬂuence
of diﬀerent ground conditions is investigated. Conductivity and permittivity impact the signal
reﬂections on ground. The LPDA VEL is simulated using ground conductivities ranging from
0.0005 S
m and using ground permittivities ranging from 2 to 10. Within the given ranges
the conductivity and permittivity independently inﬂuence the signal reﬂection properties of the
ground. In Fig. 7 the simulations of the horizontal and meridional VEL for these diﬀerent ground
conditions as function of the zenith angle at 55 MHz are shown. Diﬀerent ground conductivities do
not change the LPDA response pattern. In contrast the inﬂuence of the ground permittivity on the
antenna response is slightly higher. In the case of an applied ground permittivity of 2 and of 10,
the inﬂuence on the horizontal VEL is at the level of 1 % averaged over all frequencies and zenith
angles with a scatter of less than 6 %. The inﬂuence of the ground permittivity on the electric-ﬁeld
reconstruction is discussed in section 7.2.
Simulations of an electronic box beneath the LPDA show inﬂuences on the horizontal antenna VEL
smaller than 0.3 % which is negligible compared to the inﬂuence of the ground permittivity [48].

6 Measurement of the LPDA Vector Eﬀective Length

In this section, the reproducibility and the combination of all measurements performed on diﬀerent
days and under diﬀerent environmental conditions are discussed. Furthermore, the combined results
of the LPDA VEL are compared to the values obtained from the NEC-2 simulation.

6.1 Horizontal Vector Eﬀective Length

Here, the results of the measurements of the horizontal VEL |Hφ | are presented.
In total, ﬁve
independent measurements were performed to determine |Hφ | as a function of the zenith angle Θ.
The horizontal VEL |Hφ | in zenith angle intervals of 5◦ for three diﬀerent measurements at 35 MHz,
55 MHz and 75 MHz is shown on the left side of Fig. 8. The constant systematic uncertainties of
each ﬂight are denoted by the light colored band and the ﬂight dependent systematic uncertainties
are indicated by the dark colored band. Compared to the average VEL from 5 measurements the
median value of the ratio σ/VEL is 6 % which is well compatible with the estimated uncertainties

At the right side of Fig. 8 all performed measurements to determine |Hφ |
are combined in zenith angle intervals of 5◦, weighted by the quadratic sum of the systematic
and the statistical uncertainties of each ﬂight. The gray band describes the constant systematic
uncertainties whereas the statistical and ﬂight-dependent systematic uncertainties are combined
within the error bars. The constant systematic uncertainty of the combined horizontal VEL is 6.3 %
and the uncertainties considering ﬂight dependent systematic and statistical uncertainties for the
combined horizontal VEL result in 4.7 % at a zenith angle of (42.5 ± 2.5)◦ and a frequency of
55 MHz. The overall uncertainty of the determined LPDA VEL in the horizontal polarization adds
quadratically to 7.9 %. The overall uncertainty of all other arrival directions and frequencies are
shown on the left side of Fig. 9. On the right side of Fig. 9 a histogram of all overall uncertainties
for all frequencies and all zenith angles up to 85◦ is shown. For larger zenith angles the LPDA
loses sensitivity and the systematic uncertainty exceeds 20 %. Therefore, angles beyond 85◦ are not
considered in the following discussion. Taking all intervals of the frequencies and zenith angles
with equal weight the median overall uncertainty including statistical and systematic uncertainties
is 7.4+0.9
−0.3 %. The green curve in Fig. 8 marks the simulation of |Hφ |. The agreement between the
combined measurements and the simulation of |Hφ | is illustrated in the diagram of their ratio versus
zenith angle Θ and frequency f in the upper left panel of Fig. 10. In the upper right panel of Fig. 10
all ratios are ﬁlled into a histogram with entries weighted by sin(Θ) in consideration of the decrease
in ﬁeld of view at small zenith angles. The combined measurement and the simulation agree to
within 1 % in the median. The ﬂuctuation described by the 68 % quantile is at the level of 12 %.
The two lower panels of Fig. 10 show the median ratio as a function of the frequency (left) and as a
function of the zenith angle (right). In both cases, the red error bars mark the 68 % quantile of the
distributions.

6.2 Meridional Vector Eﬀective Length

In this subsection, the results of the meridional VEL |Hθ | are discussed. For both subcomponents
|Hθ,hor| and |Hθ,vert| three independent measurements were taken and averaged. The averaged
components are combined to determine |Hθ | as a function of the zenith angle Θ using Eq.(4.1). In
Fig. 11 all performed measurements of |Hθ | are combined in zenith angle intervals of 5◦, weighted
by the quadratic sum of the systematic and the statistical uncertainties of each ﬂight. The gray
band describes the constant systematic uncertainties whereas the statistical and ﬂight-dependent
systematic uncertainties are combined within the red error bars. The constant systematic uncertainty
of the combined VEL is 6.3 %. The uncertainties considering ﬂight dependent systematic and
statistical uncertainties of the combined VEL result in 11.2 % at a zenith angle of (42.5 ± 2.5)◦ and
a frequency of 55 MHz. The overall uncertainty of the determined LPDA VEL in the meridional
polarization adds quadratically to 12.9 %. The overall uncertainty of all other arrival directions and
frequencies are shown on the left side of Fig. 12. On the right side of Fig. 12, a histogram of all
overall uncertainties for all frequencies and all zenith angles up to 65◦ is shown. For larger zenith
angles the LPDA loses sensitivity and the systematic uncertainty exceeds 20 %. Therefore, these
angles are not considered in the following discussion. Taking all intervals of the frequencies and
zenith angles with equal weight the median overall uncertainty including statistical and systematic
uncertainties is 10.3+2.8
−1.7 %. This is larger than the uncertainty of the horizontal component |Hφ |.
The reasons are that ﬁrstly, the meridional component |Hθ | is a combination of two measurements of

of each ﬂight. The gray band in the right diagrams describes the constant systematic uncertainties whereas

smaller than in the case of |Hφ | and thirdly, the horizontal component is corrected for the octocopter
misplacement and misalignment in comparison to the meridional subcomponents where this eﬀect
is included in the systematic uncertainties. The green curve in Fig. 11 indicates the simulation of
|Hθ |. The agreement between the combination of all measurements and the simulations of |Hθ | is
illustrated by the diagram of their ratio versus zenith angle Θ and frequency f shown in the upper
left panel of Fig. 13. In the upper right panel all ratios for all zenith angles and frequencies are
ﬁlled into a histogram with entries weighted by sin(Θ) in consideration of the decrease in ﬁeld of

zenith angle (right). In both cases, the red error bars mark the 68 % quantile of the distributions.

6.3

Interpolation to all Arrival Directions and Frequencies

The horizontal and meridional VEL magnitudes are measured in the LPDA axis with highest
sensitivity to the respective VEL component (refer to section 4) and in frequency bins of 5 MHz. To
achieve an overall LPDA calibration for all incoming directions and frequencies the measurement
is combined with simulations. The LPDA VEL pattern is simulated using the NEC-2 simulation
code.
In contrast to the previous simulations presented in this work, only the LPDA with the
following ampliﬁer stage but without the transmitting antenna is taken into account. This original
simulation of the LPDA pattern is then combined with the results from the calibration campaign.
The calibrated LPDA VEL pattern is obtained by multiplying the full pattern of the simulated VEL
with the ratio of measured to simulated VEL magnitudes shown in Figs. 10 and 13. The ratios are
linearly interpolated between the measurements at each zenith angle and each frequency bin. The

method, the magnitude of the VEL is normalized to the calibration measurements, while the VEL
phase comes entirely from the original simulation.

Inﬂuence of Modiﬁed Pattern on one Example Event

To reconstruct the electric ﬁeld of a measured air shower induced radio signal the Auger software
framework Oﬀline [52] is used. To show the inﬂuence of the improved VEL, an air shower
measured in 9 stations at AERA with a zenith angle of 30◦ and an azimuth angle of 14◦ south
of east is presented as an example. The energy of the primary cosmic ray is reconstructed to
1.1 × 1018 eV using information from the surface detector. In Fig. 14 the electric ﬁeld reconstructed
at the station with highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is shown once using the simulated antenna
response with and once without the corrections owing to the measurements of the VEL magnitude
in both components. For clarity only one polarization component of the electric ﬁeld is shown.
The general shape of the electric-ﬁeld trace is the same for both reconstructions. The trace of the
modiﬁed LPDA pattern exhibits an up to 7 % larger amplitude. The measured energy ﬂuence that
scales with the amplitude squared in the east-west polarization at this station with highest SNR
changes from 100 eV
m2 . The total energy ﬂuence of all polarizations changes from 141 eV
m2
using the simulated antenna response pattern to 156 eV
m2 using the modiﬁed antenna response pattern
which is an eﬀect at the level of 9 %. The reconstructed radiation energy of the full event changes
from 7.96 MeV to 8.54 MeV. The ratio of these radiation energies is 0.93.

by one standard deviation of the overall uncertainty. The VEL phase remains unchanged. In the
case of the uncertainty due to diﬀerent ground permittivities the antenna pattern with a ground
permittivity of 2 and of 10 are used (see Fig. 7). The respective VEL is denoted as Hdown and
Hup. The antenna response is applied to a simulated electric-ﬁeld pulse using once Hup and once
Hdown, to obtain the corresponding voltage traces Uup and Udown according to Eq. (2.1). Then, the
original VEL is used to reconstruct the electric-ﬁeld pulse once from Uup and once from Udown.
From the diﬀerence of the two resulting electric-ﬁeld pulses, the systematic uncertainty of the
amplitude or the energy ﬂuence can be determined. Both uncertainties resulting from the antenna
VEL magnitude uncertainty and resulting from diﬀerent ground permittivities, are then combined

quadratically.
An additional uncertainty on the electric-ﬁeld trace can arise due to an uncertainty on the VEL
phase. An uncertainty in the VEL phase leads to a signal distortion of the radio pulse resulting
in an increased signal pulse width and a smaller electric-ﬁeld amplitude or vice versa. However,
the energy ﬂuence of the RD pulse which is given by the integral over the electric-ﬁeld trace
remains constant. Hence, a VEL phase uncertainty propagates to an additional uncertainty in the
electric-ﬁeld amplitude whereas the energy ﬂuence does not change due to a VEL phase uncertainty.
Therefore, the systematic uncertainty of the energy ﬂuence due to the VEL uncertainty is discussed
in the following.
The radio pulse is approximated with a bandpass-limited Dirac pulse and the polarization is adjusted
according to the dominant geomagnetic emission process. As the uncertainty of the VEL and the
polarization of the electric-ﬁeld pulse depend on the incoming signal direction, diﬀerent directions
in bins of 10◦ in the azimuth angle and in bins of 5◦ in the zenith angle are simulated. Due to

the changing polarization also the relative inﬂuences of the |Hφ | and |Hθ | components change with
direction. The resulting systematic uncertainty of the energy ﬂuence is presented in Fig. 15. The
square root of the energy ﬂuence is shown because the energy ﬂuence scales quadratically with
the electric-ﬁeld amplitude and the cosmic-ray energy. Hence, the systematic uncertainty of the
square root of the energy ﬂuence is the relevant uncertainty in most analyses. For most regions the
systematic uncertainty is at the level of 10 %. The uncertainty increases only at large zenith angles
(θ > 60◦) due to the increased uncertainty of |Hθ |. An azimuthal pattern appears at 90◦ and 270◦.
At these azimuth angles the uncertainty is smaller because the electric-ﬁeld pulse is polarized in
the (cid:174)eφ component and only the more precise |Hφ | component contributes. For incoming signal
directions with zenith angles smaller than 60◦ the systematic uncertainty of the square root of the
energy ﬂuence owing to the antenna calibration and diﬀerent ground permittivities is at most 14.2 %
with a median of 8.8+2.1

−1.3 %.

8 Conclusion

In this work, the results of an absolute antenna calibration are presented performed on a radio
station equipped with a logarithmic periodic dipole antenna (LPDA). The station belongs to the
AERA ﬁeld of radio stations at the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The calibrated LPDA
is representative of all the LPDAs which are mechanically and electrically identical at the percent
level.
The radio stations are used to reconstruct the electric ﬁeld emitted by cosmic particle induced air
showers which gives, e.g., a precise measure of the energy contained in the electromagnetic shower.

The accuracy of the reconstructed shower energy is limited by the uncertainty in the absolute
antenna calibration such that reduction of the uncertainties was most desirable.
The frequency and directional dependent sensitivity of the LPDA has been probed by an octocopter
carrying a calibrated radio source with dedicated polarization of the emitted radio signals. The
measured LPDA response has been quantiﬁed using the formalism of the vector eﬀective length
and decomposed in terms of a horizontal and a meridional component.
All experimental components involved in the calibration campaign were quantiﬁed with respect to
their uncertainties. Special emphasis was put on the precision in the position reconstruction of
the source which was supported by a newly developed optical system with two cameras used in
conjunction with on-board measurements of inclination, GPS, and barometric height. To ensure
reproducible results, all calibration measurements were repeated by several ﬂights on diﬀerent days
under diﬀerent environmental conditions.
The combination of all measurements gives an overall accuracy for the horizontal component of the
vector eﬀective length of 7.4+0.9
−1.7 %. Note that for
air showers with zenith angles below 60◦ the horizontal component gives the dominant contribution.
The obtained accuracy is to be compared with a previous balloon based measurement probing a
smaller phase space of the horizontal component with a systematic uncertainty of 12.5 %.
The measurements of the new calibration campaign enable thorough comparisons with simulations
of the calibration setup including ground condition dependencies using the NEC-2 program. The
measurements were used to correct the simulated pattern at multiple points in the phase space
described by arrival direction, frequency and polarization of the waves. While the median of all
correction factors are close to unity at standard ground conditions, corrections of the simulated
vector eﬀective length vary with an rms of 12 % for the horizontal component, and with rms of
26 % for the meridional component. The simulations have been further used to conﬁrm that the
measurements have been done in the far-ﬁeld region. Additionally, the LPDA sensitivity to diﬀerent
ground conditions has been investigated showing that the LPDA is insensitive to diﬀerent ground
conductivities and the sensitivity to diﬀerent permittivity is only at the level of 1 %.
The eﬀect of the correction factors on the simulated vector eﬀective length has been demonstrated
in the reconstruction of one example radio event measured with AERA.
Finally, the uncertainty of the two VEL components are propagated onto the square root of the
energy ﬂuence that is obtained by unfolding the antenna response from the measured voltage traces.
For incoming directions up to 60◦, the expected systematic uncertainty in the square root of the
energy ﬂuence due to the LPDA calibration is 8.8+2.1

−1.3 % in the median.
