ABSTRACT

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), especially the larger ones, emanate from active regions
(ARs). With the aim to understand the magnetic properties that govern such ﬂares and eruptions,
we systematically survey all ﬂare events with GOES levels of ≥ M5.0 within 45◦ from disk center
between May 2010 and April 2016. These criteria lead to a total of 51 ﬂares from 29 ARs, for which
we analyze the observational data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. More than 80%
of the 29 ARs are found to exhibit δ-sunspots and at least three ARs violate Hale’s polarity rule.
The ﬂare durations are approximately proportional to the distance between the two ﬂare ribbons,
to the total magnetic ﬂux inside the ribbons, and to the ribbon area. From our study, one of the
parameters that clearly determine whether a given ﬂare event is CME-eruptive or not is the ribbon
area normalized by the sunspot area, which may indicate that the structural relationship between
the ﬂaring region and the entire AR controls CME productivity. AR characterization show that even
X-class events do not require δ-sunspots or strong-ﬁeld, high-gradient polarity inversion lines. An
investigation of historical observational data suggests the possibility that the largest solar ARs, with
magnetic ﬂux of 2×1023 Mx, might be able to produce “superﬂares” with energies of order of 1034 erg.
The proportionality between the ﬂare durations and magnetic energies is consistent with stellar ﬂare
observations, suggesting a common physical background for solar and stellar ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are
the most catastrophic energy-conversion phenomena in
the present solar system. It is now widely accepted that
ﬂares are associated with magnetic reconnection, a phys-
ical process that rearranges the magnetic conﬁguration
and converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and
thermal energy, and with non-thermal particle acceler-
ation (Priest & Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara 2011).
Observations show that similar ﬂaring phenomena are
found in a wide variety of stars (Benz & G¨udel 2010).

Since their discovery by Carrington (1859) and
Hodgson (1859), solar ﬂares, especially the larger ones,
are known to appear in and around active regions (ARs)
including sunspots. Observationally, the complex ARs
called δ-sunspots, in which umbrae of positive and neg-
ative polarities share a common penumbra, tend to pro-
duce larger ﬂare eruptions (K¨unzel 1960; Zirin & Liggett

1987; Sammis et al. 2000). In the δ-spots, the neighbor-
ing polarities are likely to possess a strong-ﬁeld, high-
gradient, highly-sheared polarity inversion line (PIL),
which indicates the existence of intense currents that can
store free magnetic energy above in the corona (Schrijver
2007).

As the ﬂare evolves, the two ribbons extend around
the sheared PIL, which is observed in Hα and other
chromospheric lines (e.g., Dodson 1949; Bruzek 1964;
In the standard model for eruptive
Asai et al. 2004).
ﬂares, the CSHKP model (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock
1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman 1976), the ﬂare
ribbons are caused by magnetic reconnection through
the precipitation of high-energy electrons and the eﬀect
of thermal conduction, and thus they indicate the foot-
points of newly reconnected ﬁeld lines (post-ﬂare loops).
CMEs are often associated with ﬂares, particularly
with the more energetic ones (e.g., Webb & Hundhausen

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Toriumi et al.

1987; Andrews 2003; Yashiro et al. 2005; Hudson 2010).
The studies by, e.g., Wang & Zhang (2007), Cheng et al.
(2011), Kahler et al. (2015), Thalmann et al. (2015),
and Sun et al. (2015) suggest a trend that CME-eruptive
ﬂares occur at larger distances from the AR centers and
have larger “decay index” values (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006)
than the non-eruptive ones (also referred to as conﬁned
ﬂares or failed eruptions). Although a general picture
begins to emerge from these studies, each of them is
based on a small sample of selected ﬂares from diﬀerent
regions (some along with non-ﬂaring counterparts) or on
a small set of events from one target region. In a recent
analysis, Harra et al. (2016) used the set of X-class ﬂares
from the current solar cycle to show that there is no obvi-
ous diﬀerence in the ﬂare duration between the eruptive
and non-eruptive events and that the non-eruptive ones
tend to have larger spot area. In this study, we expand
the sample used by Harra et al. (2016) by lowering the
threshold to mid-M-class ﬂares and by expanding the
time interval (see Section 2.1). This also enables us to
test the ﬁndings from the studies referenced earlier in
this paragraph using a much larger sample in which the
only selection bias is that they do not occur too far from
disk center, so that their magnetic patterns are well ob-
served.

One of the ultimate goals of this paper is to ﬁnd the
physical parameters that dictate the peak magnitudes
and time scales of the GOES (Geostationary Orbiting
Environmental Satellites) soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux (GOES
parameters) and that determine whether a given ﬂare
becomes CME-eruptive or not, and in case of eruption,
the speed of the CME (CME parameters). For this pur-
pose, we carry out a systematic survey of observational
data of ﬂaring ARs obtained by the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). We especially eval-
uate the morphological properties of such ﬂaring ARs for
characterizing the magnetic environment of ﬂare erup-
tions (AR parameters) as well as those of the ﬂare rib-
bons as indicators of magnetic ﬁelds in ﬂare reconnec-
tion (ﬂare parameters), and investigate the statistical
relationships among the GOES parameters, CME pa-
rameters, AR parameters, and ﬂare parameters.

Another aim is to elucidate the formation process of
ﬂaring ARs. Since such large-scale ARs are created by
ﬂux emergence, the transportation of dynamo-generated
magnetic ﬂux in the deeper interior to the solar sur-
face (Parker 1955),
it is of necessity to conduct nu-
merical simulations and model the ﬂux emergence (Fan
2009; Cheung & Isobe 2014), which is, however, beyond
the scope of this paper. Instead, we here characterize
the ﬂaring ARs by focusing on the positional relation-
ship between the ﬂare-related ribbons (closely associated
with the PIL) and the entire AR, and examine the sta-
tistical tendencies.

To understand the diversity of ﬂare events, such as ex-
treme solar events in history, simply surveying the SDO
data set may not be suﬃcient. One possible way to ful-
ﬁll this desire is to learn from the past. Therefore, as
an example, we also introduce a great ﬂare event that
occurred in 1946 (SOL1946-07-25) and explore the pos-
sibilities of historical data analysis in combination with
our statistical results.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tions 2 and 3, we describe the data analysis and show
the statistical results, respectively. Then, Section 4 is
dedicated to characterizing the ﬂaring ARs and their
statistical trends, while in Section 5, we show the anal-
ysis on our historical ﬂare event. We discuss the results
in Section 6, and ﬁnally in Section 7, we conclude the
paper.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. Event Selection and Parameters

For the purpose of this study, we analyzed all ﬂare
events with GOES soft X-ray (SXR) magnitudes greater
than or equal to M5.0 within 45◦ from the disk center
in the period from May 2010 to April 2016, namely, six
years from the beginning to the declining phase of Solar
Cycle 24. These constraints led us to a total of 51 ﬂares
from 29 regions with distinct NOAA AR numbers. Table
1 summarizes the target 51 ﬂare events. For each event,
we obtained these GOES parameters from the GOES
SXR (1 – 8 ˚A channel) light curve:

• full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the light

curve, τFWHM,

• e-folding decay time, τdecay, and

• peak ﬂux, FSXR.

We give the method of estimation of the two time scales
in Section 2.2.

In order to identify the physical parameters that
may characterize the ﬂare events, we used the observa-
tional data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) and
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) aboard SDO. For each event, we made projection-
corrected tracked data cubes of the intensitygram, line-
of-sight (LOS) magnetogram, and 1600 ˚A images, us-
ing the mtrack module (Bogart et al. 2011). From the
intensitygram and 1600 ˚A data, center-to-limb varia-
tions were subtracted based on the method introduced
in Toriumi et al. (2014b). The data cubes have a ca-
dence of 180 s for magnetogram and intensitygram and
120 s for 1600 ˚A images, both having pixel size 1.′′0.
The sequence of each data cube is 2 or 3 hours starting
from before the GOES start time (typically 20 minutes

Magnetic Properties of Flaring Solar ARs

before), while the area of the ﬁeld of view (FOV) is
512′′ × 256′′ or 1024′′ × 512′′ centering the target AR.

From the ﬁrst frames of the intensitygram and mag-
netogram of each ﬂare event, which is well before the
ﬂare peak (typically 40 minutes before), we selected the
following AR parameters:

• sunspot area, Sspot, which is the total area of um-
brae and penumbrae of an AR, deﬁned in this
study as the de-projected area of the pixels with
intensity less than 85% of the mean quiet-Sun in-
tensity,

• total unsigned ﬂux, |Φ|AR =

|B| ds, where
SFOV (= 512′′ × 256′′ or 1024′′ × 512′′) is the FOV
area1, B is the LOS magnetic ﬂux density in each
pixel, and s (= 1′′ × 1′′) is the pixel area, and

SFOV

R

• normalized ﬁeld strength, which is the total AR
|B|AR =

ﬂux normalized by the spot area,
|Φ|AR/Sspot.

Here, the spot areas were measured in millionths of the
solar hemisphere (MSH), which is equivalent to 3.0 ×
106 km2.

For each event, we extracted the ﬂare ribbons from
1600 ˚A images by deﬁning them as the pixels with in-
tensity at any time during the ﬂare (until the last frame)
equal to or larger than 40σ (standard deviation) above
the mean of the quiet-Sun values, and made binary rib-
bon maps. After removing the saturated frames, we
stacked the binary ribbon maps over time and made a
binary ribbon composite. By plotting the ribbon com-
posite over the magnetogram (ﬁrst frame), we divide the
composite into two parts, the ribbon in the positive po-
larity and that in the negative polarity. Then, the ﬂare
parameters were deﬁned as:

• ribbon area, Sribbon, the total area of the ribbon

composite,

• ribbon distance, dribbon, the separation between
the two area-weighted (i.e., geometrical) centroids
of the ribbons in the positive and negative polari-
ties,

• total unsigned ﬂux inside the ribbon, |Φ|ribbon =

|B| ds, and

Sribbon

R

• normalized ﬁeld strength of the ribbon, |B|ribbon =

|Φ|ribbon/Sribbon.

1 Depending on the target AR, we used a FOV of 512′′ ×
1024′′ or 1024′′ × 2048′′ to cover it. However, in some cases,
the rectangular FOV contains the neighboring ﬂux concentrations
that may not be related to the target region. We masked such
ﬂux concentrations to obtain a better AR area (see Figure A1).

In addition, we determined whether each ﬂare event
was CME-eruptive or not (i.e., conﬁned) by reference
to the CME catalog2 of the Solar and Heliospheric Ob-
servatory (SOHO)/Large Angle Spectroscopic Corona-
graph (LASCO). For eruptive events,

• CME speed, VCME, the linear speed obtained by
ﬁtting a straight line to the height-time measure-
ments,

was also listed from the catalog as a CME parameter.
Note that because the current analysis is based only on
the ﬂare events within 45◦ from the disk center, there
is a potential to miss some CMEs: Yashiro et al. (2005)
suggests that roughly one in six CMEs are missed from
the on-disk M-class events (see Table 3 of their paper).
Furthermore, we followed the long-term evolution of
each AR by making HMI data cubes that covers the
AR’s whole disk passage.

2.2. Sample Event

Figure 1 shows an example of the analyzed data sets:
the X3.1-class event in NOAA AR 12192. From the
ﬁrst frames of the HMI intensitygram and magnetogram
(panels (a) and (b)), we measured the spot area Sspot,
total ﬂux |Φ|AR, and normalized ﬁeld strength |B|AR.
By temporally stacking the ﬂare ribbons extracted from
the AIA 1600 ˚A images (panel (c)), we made a rib-
bon composite (panel (d)), which provides our mea-
sure of the ribbon area Sribbon. Then, by overlaying
the ribbon composite on the magnetogram (panel (e)),
we measured the ribbon distance dribbon, the total ﬂux
|Φ|ribbon, and the mean ﬁeld strength |B|ribbon. Panel
(f) shows the GOES SXR (1 – 8 ˚A) light curve. For
measuring the FWHM time τFWHM, the background
level, which is the ﬂux at the GOES start time, is ﬁrst
subtracted from the light curve. The e-folding decay
time τdecay is calculated using the ﬂux FSXR(t) and its
time derivative dFSXR(t)/dt at the GOES end time as
τdecay = −FSXR(t)/(dFSXR(t)/dt).

Since the ﬂare ribbons expand as the ﬂare evolves
(Section 1), we need to take into account the eﬀect of
this expansion, especially the timing when the evolution
slows. Figure 2 compares the GOES light curve, the
evolution of the ribbon composite area Sribbon(t) (rib-
bon composite made from the AIA 1600 ˚A data sets until
each moment t), and the evolution of the ribbon distance
dribbon(t) (ribbon distance measured from Sribbon(t)).
The ﬁnal values of these parameters are used in the
analysis as Sribbon and dribbon. In the middle panel, we
measure the actual ribbon area at each moment t and
overplot it as S∗

ribbon(t).

Toriumi et al.

Although the most impulsive period is not seen due
to saturation in the 1600 ˚A images, S∗
ribbon(t) reaches
its maximum in the rising phase before the GOES peak
time. This is reasonable because the ribbons indicate the
heating of chromospheric plasma via thermal conduc-
tion and high-energy electrons driven by the reconnec-
tion, while the SXR loops are formed following chromo-
spheric evaporation (see, e.g., Shibata & Magara 2011).
This may be one manifestation of the so-called Neupert
eﬀect (Neupert 1968). As a result, images showing the
evolutions of Sribbon(t) and thus dribbon(t) become sat-
urated around the GOES peak.

In this study, the end times of the SDO data sets
are well after the GOES peak times, and thus we can
consider that the ribbon composite of each ﬂare event
suﬃciently reﬂects the expansion of bright ribbons.

3. STATISTICAL RESULTS

3.1. Properties of ARs and Flare Events

Table 1 shows the Mount Wilson sunspot classiﬁca-
tion. Here, 23 out of the 29 ARs (79%) show a δ-
structure at least for one ﬂare occurrence. However,
although AR 11158 was reported as non-δ, this region
actually shows a δ-conﬁguration when it produces the
ﬂares. Therefore, the actual fraction increases to 83%
for the ≥M5 events under study. This result is in line
with previous results that the δ-spots have higher ﬂare
productivity (e.g., Sammis et al. 2000).

There are three ARs (10%) that violate Hale’s polar-
ity rule for at least one ﬂare (ARs 11429, 11719, and
12158). If we also count AR 12242, which shows anti-
Hale structure until about one day before the ﬂare erup-
tion, this fraction becomes 14%. Although this number
is much larger than the typically reported value of 3 –
5% for all ARs (Richardson 1948; Wang & Sheeley 1989;
Khlystova & Sokoloﬀ 2009), the small sample number
does not allow any ﬁrm conclusion about this.

The analyzed 51 ﬂares are composed of 20 X- and
31 M-class events, ranging from M5.0 to X5.4. They
include several major ﬂares from well-studied ARs.
Among others, NOAA AR 11158 produced the ﬁrst X-
class (X2.2) ﬂare in Solar Cycle 24 (e.g., Schrijver et al.
2011), 11429 produced the largest (X5.4) ﬂare so far
in this cycle (e.g., Wang et al. 2014), 12017 produced
the “best-observed” X1.0-class ﬂare (e.g., Kleint et al.
2015), and 12192, the largest sunspot group so far in the
cycle, produced many (6 X- and 24 M-class) but CME-
poor events (e.g., Sun et al. 2015: 4 X- and 2 M-class
events are listed in Table 1). Almost all the events in this
table occurred at PILs within the AR’s magnetic struc-
ture itself. However, there are two exceptional cases:
events #29 (X1.2) and #34 (M5.1) occurred at the PIL
between two neighboring ARs.

3.2. Parameters that Dictate GOES Light Curves

In this study, from the SDO data set of each ﬂare
event, we measured various parameters: GOES parame-
ters (durations τFWHM and τdecay and GOES ﬂux FSXR),
AR parameters (spot area Sspot, total ﬂux |Φ|AR, and
ﬁeld strength |B|AR), and ﬂare parameters (ribbon area
Sribbon, distance dribbon, total ﬂux |Φ|ribbon, and ﬁeld
strength |B|ribbon). The values for all events and their
maximum, minimum, median, and standard deviation
values are shown in Table A1 of Appendix A. But here
we list the ranges and medians of these parameters:
τFWHM = 154 – 4790 s (median: 1198 s), τdecay = 32
– 1986 s (433 s), FSXR = (0.5 – 5.4) × 10−4 W m−2
(0.87 × 10−4 W m−2), Sspot = 126 – 2877 MSH (781
MSH), |Φ|AR = (1.1 – 16.6) × 1022 Mx (3.8 × 1022 Mx),
|B|AR = 568 – 810 G (685 G), Sribbon = 102 – 1639
MSH (431 MSH) dribbon = 4.1 – 105.1 Mm (26.9 Mm),
|Φ|ribbon = (0.9 – 16.1) × 1021 Mx (4.4 × 1021 Mx), and
|B|ribbon = 125 – 590 G (308 G).

In order

the measured data, namely,

to ﬁnd the physical parameters

that
dictate the GOES light curves, we made scatter
plots of
the scatter
plots of y = {τFWHM, τdecay, FSXR} versus x =
{Sspot, |Φ|AR, |B|AR, Sribbon, dribbon, |Φ|ribbon, |B|ribbon}.
For x, we also used the ratio of the two areas,
Sribbon/Sspot, ranging 9.0 – 328% (median:
56%),
and that of total ﬂuxes, |Φ|ribbon/|Φ|AR = 1.6 – 43%
(11%). Then, for obtaining the empirical relationship,
we evaluated for each diagram the power-law index
α by ﬁtting the data with a power-law function,
log y = α log x + const., or y ∝ xα. We also measured
the correlation coeﬃcient, CC(log x, log y), to estimate
the degree of dispersion of each plot. Note that we
assumed errors for y-coordinate only.

As a result, we obtained 27 scatter plots and thus
27 empirical relations, whose power-law indices α and
correlation coeﬃcients CC are summarized in Table 2.
Figure 3 displays the six least-scattered plots (strongest
correlations with |CC| ≥ 0.6: highlighted with bold face
in Table 2).

The best correlations are obtained from the scatter
plots of the FWHM duration of the ﬂares, τFWHM (Fig-
ures 3(a–c)). They are of the ﬂare parameters: the rib-
bon distance, dribbon,

log τFWHM = (0.96 ± 0.09) log dribbon + (1.67 ± 0.13),

(1)

the ribbon total ﬂux, |Φ|ribbon,

log τFWHM = (1.04 ± 0.12) log |Φ|ribbon + (−19.4 ± 2.51),
(2)

and the ribbon area, Sribbon,

log τFWHM = (1.10 ± 0.15) log Sribbon + (0.08 ± 0.40),

Magnetic Properties of Flaring Solar ARs

(3)

with correlation coeﬃcients of CC = 0.83, 0.79, and
0.72, respectively. Interestingly, all the above equations
show power-law indices of approximately unity, α ∼ 1.
The other parameters show a more scattered distribu-
tion: except for the AR ﬁeld strength, |B|AR, they have
positive relations (see Table 2).

The other three best relations are of the e-folding de-
cay time, τdecay (Figures 3(d–f)), and they are of the
same ﬂare parameters: the ribbon distance, dribbon,

log τdecay = (0.88 ± 0.12) log dribbon + (1.35 ± 0.18),

(4)

the ribbon total ﬂux, |Φ|ribbon,

log τdecay = (0.96 ± 0.15) log |Φ|ribbon + (−18.2 ± 3.21),
(5)

and the ribbon area, Sribbon,

log τdecay = (1.05 ± 0.18) log Sribbon + (−0.21 ± 0.47),

(6)

with CC = 0.71, 0.68, and 0.64, respectively. It is nat-
ural that τdecay also shows strong correlations with the
above three parameters, because τFWHM and τdecay are
highly correlated with each other (CC = 0.87). Al-
though the distributions for τdecay are a bit more scat-
tered and thus the correlations are slightly weaker than
those of τFWHM, the power-law indices still show α ∼ 1.
The other parameters also show similar trends to those
of τFWHM with similar power-law indices. However,
again, the correlations are on average weaker than those
of τFWHM.

On the other hand, no diagrams of the GOES peak
ﬂux, FSXR, have higher (|CC| ≥ 0.6) correlations. The
maximum correlation coeﬃcient here is just CC = 0.37
of the ribbon total ﬂux, |Φ|ribbon. They show generally
positive correlations, but |B|AR and Sribbon/Sspot show
negative relations.

In this data set, we only have a range of one order
of magnitude for the GOES peak ﬂux, FSXR = (0.5 –
5.4) × 10−4 W m−2, while the GOES durations span
more than one order, τFWHM = 154 – 4790 s and τdecay =
32 – 1986 s. This narrow range of FSXR may be one of
the factors that cause the weaker correlations.

3.3. Parameters that Determine CME Properties

In our data set of 51 ≥M5-class events, there are 32
CME eruptive and 19 non-eruptive events. In this sec-
tion, we search the parameters that determine CME
rich/poor and their speed.

Figure 4 displays the histograms for CME eruptive
and non-eruptive events. From the top row, one may

see that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in distribu-
tions of durations and magnitudes between the eruptive
and non-eruptive cases. The averages of the log val-
ues (indicated by vertical dashed lines) for the eruptive
and non-eruptive are τFWHM = 1068 and 826 s (dif-
ference = 26%3), τdecay = 386 and 314 s (20%), and
FSXR = 1.1 × 10−4 and 0.83 × 10−4 W m−2 (23%), re-
spectively. Thus, at least for the ≥M5-class events, the
longer-duration or larger-magnitude ﬂares are not nec-
essarily CME-eruptive.

One of the clear diﬀerences is seen in the spot area,
In the second row of Figure 4, distributions of
Sspot.
Sspot show a large discrepancy. Here, the non-eruptive
events have larger spot areas. The log averages are 526
MSH for eruptive and 1171 MSH for non-eruptive (dif-
ference = 76%), and the spot areas of the eruptive cases
are signiﬁcantly smaller than the non-eruptive at the
99.5% conﬁdence level (see Appendix B). As one might
expect, the latter value is to some extent inﬂuenced by
the six non-eruptive events from the cycle’s largest spot
group, AR 12192 (Figure 1). However, even without
these ﬂares, the log-mean spot area of the remaining
13 events is still 801 MSH (diﬀerence = 41%) and the
distribution diﬀerence is signiﬁcant at 95% conﬁdence.
On the other hand, the distributions and thus the mean
values of the ribbon area, Sribbon, are similar for the
eruptive and non-eruptive: the log means are 432 and
419 MSH, respectively (diﬀerence = 3.0%).

As a result of the diﬀerences in Sspot and Sribbon,
the area ratios, Sribbon/Sspot, also show a diﬀerence in
the distributions with log-mean values of 0.82 and 0.36
for eruptive and non-eruptive, respectively (diﬀerence
= 79%). The threshold dividing the two regimes is
about 0.5. This clear diﬀerence may indicate that what
determines the CME productivity is the relative struc-
tural relation between the magnetic ﬁelds of the ﬂaring
region (sheared PIL, ﬂare ribbons, ﬂare arcades, etc.)
and those of the entire AR.

Tendencies similar to those of the areas (Sspot and
Sribbon) are seen for the total magnetic ﬂux (bottom row
of Figure 4). The log-mean values of |Φ|AR for the erup-
tive and non-eruptive are 3.2 × 1022 and 6.0 × 1022 Mx
(diﬀerence = 59%; signiﬁcant at 99.5% conﬁdence), re-
spectively, while those of |Φ|ribbon are 3.8 × 1021 and
4.1 × 1021 Mx (6.5%), respectively. And thus the log

Previous ﬁndings of our earlier report, Harra et al.
(2016), and of event studies introduced in Section 1
are conﬁrmed by the present comprehensive survey: the
present work covers all on-disk ﬂare events over a six-
year period including the cycle maximum without selec-
tion bias and extends the on-disk sample of Harra et al.
(2016) with the GOES peak brightness reaching down
to M5 level, which is one virtue of this study4.

In order to ﬁnd the parameters that control the CME
speed, we made scatter plots of VCME, similar to those
in Section 3.2 but this time also of GOES parameters,
τFWHM, τdecay, and FSXR. The rightmost column of Ta-
ble 2 summarizes the power-law indices, α, and their cor-
relation coeﬃcients, CC. The largest value is CC = 0.5
for the ribbon area Sribbon, ribbon ﬂux |Φ|ribbon, and
GOES decay time τdecay, which are shown in Figure 5.
Note that for a sample number of 32, any correlation
over 0.45 is signiﬁcant at 99% conﬁdence. In this study,
we only selected the ﬂares that occurred within 45◦ from
disk center, which makes the VCME values rather uncer-
tain. Projection eﬀects due to non-radial motions may
also increase the scatter. However, even with such un-
certainties, the results show signiﬁcant higher correla-
tion.

4. MAGNETIC PATTERNS OF FLARE ZONES

In ﬂaring ARs, sheared magnetic structures responsi-
ble to the ﬂare productions, such as sheared PILs, are
probably created by the large-scale ﬂux emergence and
the (resultant) relative motions of the sunspots (e.g.,
Kurokawa 1989). Besides, the geometrical relationship
between the sheared PILs and the entire AR may deter-
mine the characteristics of the ﬂare events. Therefore,
in this section, we focus on the creation of sheared PILs
in the entire ARs and investigate the ﬂare production in
diﬀerent types of ARs. The details of this characteriza-
tion are summarized in Figure 6.

The ﬁrst characterization is the “spot-spot” group, in
which a large, long sheared PIL extends across the en-
tire AR between the two major polarities or between the
two clusters of sunspots of opposite polarities. Such ARs
may naturally harbor large ﬂare ribbons. Among the 11
ARs (21 events) that belong to this category (see bottom
of Figure 6), NOAA AR 11429 produced the strongest
(X5.4-class) ﬂare so far in this solar cycle. Based on the
numerical simulation of ﬂux emergence, Takasao et al.
(2015) suggested the possibility that AR 11429 was cre-
ated by an emergence of a tightly-twisted, kink-unstable

4 For example, 20 on-disk ﬂares from the whole 42 X-class events
were used in the plot for the ﬂare duration versus the spot area
in Harra et al. (2016, Figure 5). In the present work, the sample
number of the on-disk events is expanded to 51, i.e., by a factor
of 2.5, which contains the previous 20 ﬂares.

ﬂux tube (see also, e.g., Tanaka 1991; Linton et al. 1996;
Fan et al. 1998). The spot-spot may also be created by
many episodes of ﬂux emergence.

The second group is that of the “spot-satellite”. 25
events from 15 ARs belong to this category. Here, newly
emerging, often minor, magnetic ﬂux appears just next
to one of the pre-existing main polarities and creates a
compact PIL between the main and satellite spots. Such
a close emergence of satellite spots hints that the satel-
lite spots are connected to the main polarity below the
surface as a parasite tube, like illustrated in Figure 6.
Or perhaps the satellite spots are from an independent
minor ﬂux tube, which is ﬂoating in the convection zone
and trapped by the main tube that rises through the in-
terior. The “best-observed” X1.0-class ﬂare of AR 12017
(event #31: Kleint et al. 2015) falls into this category.
Then, the “quadrupole” group follows these two ma-
jorities (three events, two ARs). In this group, two op-
posite polarities from diﬀerent emerging bipoles collide
each other, show shear motion, and create a sheared PIL
in between. By comparing ﬂux emergence simulation
and observational data, Toriumi et al. (2014a) obtained
a suggestion that AR 11158 is created from a single
ﬂux tube that emerges at the two locations (Fang & Fan
2015).

The last group, “inter-AR”, is of the ﬂares produced
on the PIL formed between two apparently indepen-
dent ARs (two events from diﬀerent AR pairs). The
clearest example is the X1.2-class ﬂare (event #29:
M¨ostl et al. 2015), which occurred between AR 11944
and the decayed AR 11943. This category resembles
the quadrupole events. However, we here divide these
two groups by whether the ﬂare occurred between the
polarities that belong to a single NOAA-numbered AR,
or between the polarities of independent ARs with dif-
ferent NOAA numbers, since this categorization may
imply whether a mutual (subsurface) magnetic connec-

events have a δ-conﬁguration at the ﬂaring site. And
thus, this group reminds us of the eruption of a quiescent
ﬁlament, which is created in the quiet Sun between ex-
tended AR remnants, probably with the support of shear
ﬂows caused by the diﬀerential rotation (Mackay et al.
2010). Perhaps, the inter-AR events occupy an interme-
diate position between the ﬂares from ARs and those of
quiescent ﬁlament eruptions.

In reviewing these four patterns identiﬁed in ﬂaring
regions, we note that the spot-spot group may possess
larger ﬂare ribbons since the ﬂares of this group are
likely to occur above the extended sheared PILs across
the entire ARs. Conversely, the spot-satellite events are
expected to have smaller ribbons. The top row of Fig-
ure 7 clearly shows the above trends. Here, the spot-
spot events have larger ribbon distance, ribbon ﬂux, and

Magnetic Properties of Flaring Solar ARs

ribbon area, while the spot-satellite ﬂares have smaller
values. The log averages of the above parameters for
the spot-spot and spot-satellite are dribbon = 51.0 and
12.9 Mm (diﬀerence = 119%), |Φ|ribbon = 7.9 × 1021
and 2.3 × 1021 Mx (112%), Sribbon = 715 and 277 MSH
(88%). The quadrupole and inter-AR values generally
sit between the two major groups.

Then, through the statistical relations (1), (2), and
(3), the spot-spot events have longer GOES durations,
and the spot-satellite ones are shorter (middle row of
Figure 7). Again, the quadrupole and inter-AR events
are in the intermediate positions. As seen from the
bottom row of this ﬁgure, the spot-spot events have
the FWHM durations of & 1000 s, the spot-satellite
. 1000 s.

Similar trends are obtained for the e-folding decay
time through relations (4), (5), and (6). The criti-
cal value dividing the two regimes is τdecay ∼ 200 s.
However, the GOES peak ﬂux does not show a promi-
nent contrast between the distributions of the spot-spot
log mean values are 1.1 × 10−4 and
and spot-satellite:
0.86 × 10−4 W m−2, respectively (diﬀerence = 27%).

These results lead us to the conclusion that the struc-
tural diﬀerences of the ﬂaring ARs determine the size of
the sheared PILs and thus of the ﬂare ribbons, which dic-
tate the ﬂare durations. On the other hand, the GOES
ﬂux has much weaker relation with the structural diﬀer-
ences, which we hypothesize to reﬂect that other factors
than only geometry are involved in setting the total en-
ergy and intensity proﬁle of a ﬂare.

The fractions of the CME-eruptive events for the spot-
spot, spot-satellite, quadrupole, and inter-AR events are
57% (12 in 21 events), 64% (= 16/25), 67% (= 2/3),
and 100% (= 2/2), respectively. Therefore, the spot-
spot events are less likely to be CME-eruptive than the
spot-satellite events. This result is well in line with the
discussions in the previous sections that a strong over-
lying arcade, which is likely to exist in a spot-spot AR,
prohibits the CME eruption. However, because of the
small sample numbers, it is diﬃcult to make any ﬁrm
conclusion on the quadrupole and inter-AR events.

5. POSSIBILITIES OF HISTORICAL DATA

ANALYSIS

Figure 8 shows perhaps the largest-ever imaged
sunspot-related ﬂare ribbons. This sunspot group,
numbered 14585 by the Royal Greenwich Observatory
(RGO) and 8129 by the Mount Wilson Observatory, pro-
duced a great ﬂare on 1946 July 25 (ﬂare importance
3+: Ellison 1949); in modern usage SOL1946-07-25. In
the list of Sunspot Groups with Largest Areas main-

tained at NAOJ5, RGO 14585 ranks fourth. Accord-
ing to Dodson & Hedeman (1949) and RGO reports,
this region had a spot size of 4279 MSH that day with
βγ-conﬁguration. Ellison (1946) observed in Hα and
many other lines and reported that the great ﬂare con-
tinued for several hours. It started before 16:15 UT and
reached its maximum intensity around 16:30 UT. By
17:30 UT, a bright emission had increased to 2500 MSH
in area, accompanied by a ﬁlament of 550 Mm in length.
His observation continued at least until 18:10 UT. The
ﬂare caused a great geomagnetic storm 26.5 hours later,
and even triggered a ground level enhancement (GLE:
Forbush 1946; Neher & Roesch 1948). This region re-
peatedly produced ﬂare eruptions (Dodson & Hedeman
1949).

As is seen from Figure 8, this region is composed
of a number of spots, i.e., highly fragmented. On the
other hand, it exhibits a giant ﬂare ribbon that extends
over the entire region. In fact, our measurement of the
spot size in Ca II K1v, Sspot, and ribbon size in Hα,
Sribbon, are 4200 and 3570 MSH (projection corrected
values), respectively. Here, Sribbon might be underes-
timated because the ribbon possibly expanded more in
the later phase, and thus the area ratio, Sribbon/Sspot, is
at least 85%, which indicates that a considerable fraction
of RGO 14585 was involved in the ﬂare production.

We can place this region in the context of our present
sample through the relationship in Figure 9, which
shows the scatter plot of AR total ﬂux |Φ|AR versus
spot area Sspot for the 51 ≥M5-class events that we an-
alyzed in Section 3. Note that Sspot indicates the total
area of umbrae and penumbrae, i.e., the sunspot area,
rather than the area of the entire AR. The linear ﬁtting
to this log-log plot provides the relation of

log |Φ|AR = (0.74 ± 0.04) log Sspot + (20.5 ± 0.13).

(7)

Using this equation, the measured spot area of 4200
MSH on July 25 yields a ﬂux of 1.5 × 1023 Mx, which
is comparable to the maximum of our ≥M5 data set,
(1.4 – 1.7) × 1023 Mx of AR 12192. Although this re-
gion appeared before the δ classiﬁcation was introduced
by K¨unzel (1960), this region is likely to possess a δ-
conﬁguration since the long ﬂare ribbons lie in the mid-
dle of the spots that share common penumbrae. For
the same reason, we can categorize this region as “spot-
spot”.

In addition, from the Hα image, we estimated the
ribbon distance dribbon. We here took the two largest
ribbon groups and measured the distance between the

centroids: see Figure 8(d). Through equation (1), the
obtained value, dribbon = 62 Mm, which should also be
considered as a lower limit, yields the FWHM duration,
τFWHM, of 2400 s. The actual duration of the ﬂare event
is not clear but may be a few times of this value, say,
a few hours. In fact, the observations revealed that the
ﬂare continued at least for 110 minutes (Ellison 1946:
observed mainly in Hα).

Furthermore,

the large area ratio of this event,
Sribbon/Sspot ≥ 85%, implies the occurrence of a CME
(see, e.g., Figure 4).
In fact, the great ﬂare caused a
geomagnetic storm after 26.5 hours and even a GLE
(Forbush 1946), which suggests the existence of a severe
disturbance such as a fast CME.

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Interpretation of the Obtained Relations

In this study, we have conducted a statistical anal-
ysis of 51 solar ﬂares with GOES magnitude ≥M5
emanating from 29 ARs, and have obtained six high-
correlation (|CC| ≥ 0.64) empirical relations, (1) – (6).
They indicate that the durations of the GOES light
curves (FWHM duration τFWHM and e-folding decay
time τdecay) correlate linearly with the ﬂare parameters
(ribbon distance dribbon, ribbon total ﬂux |Φ|ribbon, and
ribbon area Sribbon). If we use τﬂare to simply denote
the ﬂare duration, they can be characterized by

τﬂare ∝ dribbon,

τﬂare ∝ |Φ|ribbon,

τﬂare ∝ Sribbon.

(8)

(9)

(10)

and

In this section, we discuss the physical interpretations
of these relations.

First, what do the ﬂare parameters, dribbon, |Φ|ribbon,
and Sribbon, mean? As we mentioned in Section 1, in the
standard (CSHKP) ﬂare model, the ﬂare ribbons are
caused by coronal magnetic energy released into high-
energy electrons and thermal conduction. Therefore,
we can assume that the ribbons are the footpoints of
newly reconnected post-ﬂare loops. Figure 10 shows
schematic illustrations of the standard model. As the
ﬁlament erupts, overlying coronal ﬁelds reconnect under
the ﬁlament, and the post-ﬂare loops and ﬂare ribbons
are created. From Figures 10(b) and (c), it is seen that
the distance between the two centroids of the ribbon
composite, dribbon, indicate the footpoint separation be-
tween the representative post-ﬂare loop. If the loop con-
ﬁguration does not diﬀer much for diﬀerent ﬂare events,
the loop half length, L, would be proportional to dribbon,

i.e., L ∝ dribbon. Meanwhile, |Φ|ribbon indicates the to-
tal magnetic ﬂux in the ribbon composites, identiﬁable
with the ﬂux involved in the ﬂare reconnection, whereas
Sribbon is the total area of the composite.

For explaining the ﬁrst relation, τﬂare ∝ dribbon, we
here simply assume that the duration of the ﬂares, es-
pecially the evolutionary phase when the ribbon expan-
sion occurs (see Section 2.2), is comparable to the re-
connection time scale, i.e., τﬂare ∼ τrec. This time scale
is roughly estimated as τrec ∼ L/Vin, where Vin is the
velocity of pre-reconnection magnetic ﬁelds ﬂowing into
the electric current sheet, and this relation is rewrit-
ten as τrec ∼ τA/MA, where τA ≡ L/VA is the Alfv´en
transit time over the loop, VA the Alfv´en velocity, and
MA = Vin/VA the Alfv´en Mach number. If we assume
from Figure 10(c) that L ∼ dribbon, we ﬁnd the propor-
tionality τﬂare ∼ dribbon/(VAMA).

It is seen for example from Figure 3(a) that VAMA =
20 – 30 km s−1, and applying MA = 0.01 – 0.1,
the typical values for the Petschek-type reconnection
model (Petschek 1964) obtained from resistive-MHD
simulations (e.g., Yokoyama & Shibata 1997, 1998), one
may ﬁnd that VA ranges from a few 100 to a few
1000 km s−1.
Such values can be consistent with
the Alfv´en speed inferred observationally for the solar
corona (e.g., Gopalswamy et al. 2001), though not the
core of an active region, indicating that the above esti-
mation is fairly plausible.

However, because the observed characteristics in this
study such as the ﬂare time scales are the result of
the superposition of elementary ﬂare loops, and because
each ﬂare loop experiences diﬀerent stages of thermal
processes after the reconnection (i.e., the chromospheric
evaporation, conductive cooling, and radiative cooling),
which may have diﬀerent time scales (Reale 2007), it is
of high importance to conduct MHD simulations of ﬂare
reconnection and post-ﬂare loops including thermody-
namic processes in order to explore the essential physics
involved in the loop.

Relation (9), τﬂare ∝ |Φ|ribbon, may be easier to un-
derstand: as more magnetic ﬂux is involved, the recon-

nection processes continue longer.
rate is comparable for various events, the ribbon area
also could have a linear proportion, i.e., relation (10),
τﬂare ∝ Sribbon.

In any case, the clear correlations between the ﬂare
duration and ﬂare parameters (ribbon distance, mag-
netic ﬂux, and area), especially those of τﬂare ∝ dribbon,
strongly point to the physical connections underly-
ing them. For example, recently it has been sug-
gested that the impulsive events with shorter ribbon
distance, dribbon, yield more intense white-light ﬂares
(Watanabe et al. 2016). This may imply that the loop
physics of compact coronal loops, with smaller L, cor-

responds to more intense energy release deeper in the
photosphere. We may utilize this relation in the op-
posite manner. The observation of ﬂare durations may
allow us to investigate the physical states of the recon-
nected loops, such as those of unresolved stellar ﬂares
(e.g., Mullan et al. 2006).

6.2. Emergence, Flares, and Superﬂares

One of the important lessons we have learned is that
major ﬂares are produced from various types of ARs. X-
class events are produced not only from the classical δ-
spots such as those classiﬁed by Zirin & Liggett (1987),
or “spot-spot”, “spot-satellite”, and “quadrupole” in
this study, but even from the PILs between separated,
independent ARs with no δ-conﬁgurations, i.e., “inter-
AR”, like the X1.2 event from ARs 11944 and 11943
(event #29).

Also, the fraction of the region that is involved in the
ﬂare reconnection in a single AR diﬀers substantially.
The area of the ribbon composite normalized by the
spot area, Sribbon/Sspot, ranges from 9.0 to 300% for
the analyzed ≥M5 ﬂares (except for the three inter-AR
events), while the ribbon ﬂux normalized by AR ﬂux,
|Φ|ribbon/|Φ|AR, ranges from 1.6 to 43%.

Therefore, we need a systematic survey using ﬂux
emergence simulations to model these types of ARs
(Toriumi et al. 2014a; Fang & Fan 2015; Takasao et al.
2015; Chatterjee et al. 2016) and investigate their for-
mation processes as well as the storage of magnetic

energy (amount, place, etc.).
that Sribbon/Sspot and |Φ|ribbon/|Φ|AR are larger for the
CME-eruptive events, which may indicate the impor-
tance of the relative magnetic structure of the ﬂaring
region and the entire AR. Thus, numerical experiments
on ﬂux emergence and ﬂare AR formation are necessary
also for the investigation on the CME productions.

From the statistical analysis of the stellar ﬂares ob-
tained by Kepler space telescope, Maehara et al. (2012)
suggested that superﬂares with energy of 1034 erg occur
once in 800 years on the Sun-like stars (slowly rotat-
ing G-type main sequence stars). Shibata et al. (2013)
showed through order-of-magnitude estimations that in
typical solar dynamo models, it may be possible to gen-
erate a large sunspot with a total ﬂux of 2 × 1023 Mx,
which accounts for the ﬂare of 1034 erg, within one solar
cycle period. On the other hand, Aulanier et al. (2013)
argued that superﬂares of 1034 erg are unrealistic for
observed solar conditions because of the fragmentation
of magnetic ﬂux in an AR: all large sunspot groups are
highly fragmented, i.e., composed of many ﬂux emer-
gence events, and thus magnetic shear tends to be lo-
calized. Therefore, only parts of the sunspots might
be involved in the ﬂare reconnection process (see also
Schrijver et al. 2012).

However, as we saw in Section 5, even one of the
largest, highly fragmented sunspot groups such as RGO
14585 could spout a ﬂare eruption leaving AR-sized, gi-
gantic ﬂare ribbons, which may point to the possibility
that even larger ARs could occur and cause a super-
ﬂare. The largest sunspot group since the 19th century,
RGO 14886, recorded a maximum spot area of 6132
MSH on 1947 April 8 (see Figure 3 of Aulanier et al.
2013). From equation (7), we estimate its total ﬂux to
be 2.0 × 1023 Mx. Therefore, considering the two fac-
tors that one of the largest ARs produced the AR-scale
eruption and an AR of 2 × 1023 Mx is likely to have ex-
isted, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that
an AR of 2 × 1023 Mx produces AR-scale eruptions. We
will then estimate the ﬂare energy in the next section.

where Vmag is the volume of magnetic ﬁelds involved in
the ﬂare reconnection. We assume here that Vmag ∼
2SribbonL, where L is the half length of the reconnected
loop (Figure 10), and that L ∼ dribbon. The parame-
ters used in this equation for deriving the typical value
are the means from the 51 analyzed events, and the
estimated magnetic energy ranges from 9.2 × 1030 to
4.4 × 1033 erg.

The magnetic energy (11) may provide better esti-
mates for the ﬂare energy, Eﬂare ∼ f Emag, where f is
the fraction of the magnetic energy that is released in
the ﬂare event, compared to another expression (e.g.,
Maehara et al. 2012; Shibata et al. 2013; Aulanier et al.

from equation (11) with |B|ribbon ∼ 384 G
07-25),
(mean of the spot-spot events), Sribbon ∼ 3570 MSH,
and dribbon ∼ 62 Mm, the energy estimate becomes
8 × 1033 erg. If we suppose the situation that the largest
sunspot group RGO 14886 (Sspot = 6132 MSH on 1947
April 8) causes a whole-AR-scale eruption like the 1946

event, which may not be very unrealistic, using the val-
ues of |B|ribbon ∼ 384 G, Sribbon ∼ 5210 MSH (assuming
the area ratio, Sribbon/Sspot, of 85%), and dribbon being,
say, 80 Mm, the estimated magnetic energy amounts to
1.5 × 1034 erg. Although what fraction is converted to
the ﬂare energy is not clear, the above results indicate
the possibility that the ﬂare energy of such gigantic ARs
may be up to of the order of 1034 erg.

Figure 11 compares the time scales of the ﬂare, τﬂare,

The scatter plots show the proportionalities of τFWHM ∝

(correlation coeﬃcient CC = 0.81) and
τdecay ∝ E0.41±0.06
(CC = 0.69), which is surprisingly
consistent with the results of the superﬂare analysis by
Maehara et al. (2015), τﬂare ∝ E0.39±0.03
, where τﬂare
and Eﬂare are the e-folding decay time and bolometric
energy, respectively. Note that their values are mea-
sured from Kepler’s photometric data that covers from
4200 to 9000 ˚A, i.e., the optical regime. Maehara et al.
(2015) explained this proportionality by combining the
two relations, τﬂare ∼ τA/MA ∼ L/VA/MA ∝ L (Sec-
tion 6.1) and Eﬂare ∼ f Emag ∼ f B2L3/(8π) ∝ L367
to give τﬂare ∝ E1/3
ﬂare. However, from equations (8),
(10), and (11), one can also derive the relation Emag ∝
Sribbondribbon ∝ τ 2
ﬂare, which may suggest that the time-
energy relation is τﬂare ∝ E1/2
Still, the consis-

tent proportionalities suggest the existence of the com-

7. CONCLUSION

In this study, we have examined all 51 ≥M5.0-class,
on-disk (≤45◦ from disk center) events, emanating from
29 ARs, in the period of May 2010 to April 2016, i.e.,
six years from the activity minimum of Solar Cycle 24.
Out of the 29 ARs, 24 regions (83%) showed δ-spot
conﬁgurations, while three regions violated Hale’s po-
larity rule at the instant of ﬂare occurrence. The 51
ﬂare events consist of 20 X- and 31 M-class events.

With the aim to ﬁnd the physical parameters that dic-
tate the GOES light curves, we systematically surveyed
the correlations between GOES parameters (time scales
and peak ﬂux) and AR and ﬂare parameters (spot size,
ribbon size, etc.) for the 51 events. The strongest corre-

6 In their order-of-magnitude estimate, Maehara et al. (2015)
make the ad-hoc assumption that the sunspot ﬁeld strength B
does not vary much for diﬀerent events and is typically of the
same order, 1000 G.

7 Many ﬂare analyses are based on the simple assumption that
the ﬂare energy Eﬂare scales with the peak SXR brightness FSXR.
However, the low correlations between the SXR brightness and
the ﬂare parameters in Table 2 (e.g., CC = 0.23 for FSXR versus
Sribbon) may indicate that the assumption is not necessarily the
case.

lations were obtained for τﬂare (i.e., τFWHM and τdecay)
versus dribbon, |Φ|ribbon, and Sribbon, and all these rela-
tions showed approximately linear correlations.

The ﬁrst relation, τﬂare ∝ dribbon, can be explained
by assuming that (1) the distance between the rib-
bon composites in the positive and negative polarities,
dribbon, represents the length of the reconnected (post-
ﬂare) loops, L, and (2) the ﬂare duration, τﬂare, is dom-
inated by the reconnection time, τrec, which should be
related to the Alfv´en transit time over the loop length,
τA ≡ L/VA. Then, we obtain the relation τﬂare ∼ τrec ∼
τA/MA ∼ L/VA/MA ∝ L ∝ dribbon. To further inves-
tigate this proportionality with considering the thermal
processes, however, we may need the help of loop simu-
lations including thermodynamics, because what we ob-
served is a superposition of elementary ﬂare loops and
each ﬂare loop undergoes several stages of thermal pro-
cesses.

The other two proportionalities, τﬂare ∝ |Φ|ribbon and
τﬂare ∝ Sribbon, may be easier to understand. The for-
mer simply shows that as more magnetic ﬂux is involved,
the reconnection processes continue longer. The latter
may also be accepted if we assume that the strength of
the ﬁeld lines are not so diﬀerent among the events.

The largest-magnitude, or longest-duration ﬂares do
not necessarily produce CMEs. Although this is obvi-
ous when considering the perfect example of AR 12192,
the statistical analysis clearly shows the general trend
that the non-eruptive events have smaller Sribbon/Sspot
and |Φ|ribbon/|Φ|AR, which may indicate that in the non-
eruptive regions, the existence of embedding ﬁeld in-
hibits CME eruption. Therefore, we can speculate that
the relative structural relation between the ﬂaring re-
gion and the entire AR is a key to determine whether
the ﬂare becomes eruptive or not.

Most of the 51 ﬂare events under study originated
from the interiors of active regions Only two events are
not from inside the ARs but from the boundaries be-
tween separated, independent ARs. The ﬁrst group can
be subdivided into three categories, “spot-spot,” “spot-
satellite,” and “quadrupole.” The latter, the “inter-AR”
group, shows us that high-M or even X-class events can
be produced without strong-ﬁeld, high-gradient PILs.
The representative event may be the X1.2 ﬂare from
between ARs 11944 and 11943. Several scenarios were
suggested in this paper to model the formation of the
above ARs. These should be examined through system-
atic survey using ﬂux emergence simulations, which we
shall leave for future research.

The historical record of a gigantic sunspot group,
RGO 14585, allows us to know that even the largest,
fragmented ARs can produce massive ﬂare eruptions
with AR-sized ﬂare ribbons. The estimation of dribbon
and Sribbon/Sspot suggests that the great ﬂare of RGO

14585 is a long-duration event with a CME eruption,
which is in line with the observational facts. Perhaps
this event points to the possibility of the eruption of
even larger ARs. Estimations suggest that an AR of
2 × 1023 Mx is likely to have existed and that if it is
ﬂaring, it could produce superﬂares with an energy of
order of 1034 erg.

Finally, we found the correlations of τﬂare ∝ E0.4
mag,
which is well in line with the stellar ﬂare (superﬂare)
observations. This clear consistency favors a common
physical background for solar and stellar ﬂares.

(intensity of ≥ 40σ above the mean) in this frame. (d) De-
tected ﬂare ribbons from some selected frames are overlaid
(black). The red contour outlining these ribbons indicates
the ribbon composite. (e) Composite ribbons in the positive
(orange) and negative (turquoise) polarities plotted over the
magnetogram (b). Red “+” signs show the area-weighted
centroids of the two ribbons. A red straight line connects the
two centroids, indicating the ribbon distance. (f) GOES SXR
1 – 8 ˚A ﬂux (solid curve). Three vertical dashed lines show
(from left to right) the GOES start (21:07 UT), peak (21:47
UT), and end (22:13 UT) times. The horizontal dashed line
indicates the background level, which is the ﬂux measured
at the GOES start time. After subtracting this background
level from the light curve, FWHM time is measured (red ar-
row), while the ﬂux and its time derivative at the GOES
end time (red diamond) are used for measuring the e-folding
decay time.

b Mount Wilson sunspot classification on the day of the flare occurrence provided by NOAA/USAF. β is
assigned to a sunspot group which has both positive and negative polarities. γ indicates that a sunspot group
has a complex region of multiple spots with intermixed polarity. δ indicates that at least one sunspot contains
opposite polarities inside a common penumbra separated by no more than 2◦ in heliographic distance.

Note—NOAA number with asterisk (∗) indicates inter-AR flare. Event #29 occurred between NOAA ARs

11944 and 11943, and #34 between ARs 12173 and 12172.

APPENDIX

A. TARGET FLARES AND MEASURED PARAMETERS

Figure A1 lists the 51 ﬂare events that we analyzed in this paper. Here we show the HMI magnetogram before the
ﬂare onset as a background overlaid by the composite ﬂare ribbons. Ribbon distance is shown by a red line connecting
the centroids of the ribbons in the positive and negative polarities. In some events, we separate the target AR from
neighboring ﬂux concentrations with thin lines.

Table A1 shows all measured parameters of the 51 ﬂare events: GOES parameters (durations τFWHM and τdecay
and GOES ﬂux FSXR), AR parameters (spot area Sspot, total ﬂux |Φ|AR, and ﬁeld strength |B|AR), ﬂare parameters
(ribbon area Sribbon, distance dribbon, total ﬂux |Φ|ribbon, and ﬁeld strength |B|ribbon), and a CME parameter (CME
speed VCME). The maximum, minimum, median, and standard deviation (σ) of each parameter are summarized at
the bottom of this table.

B. STATISTICAL TESTS ON THE CME-ERUPTIVE AND NON-ERUPTIVE DISTRIBUTIONS

First, we compare the spot areas Sspot for the CME-eruptive and non-eruptive cases. Here we use suﬃx 1 for eruptive

distribution and 2 for non-eruptive group. From Table A1, the two sample distributions are

and

Sspot,1 = [678, 391, 315, 288, 284, 220, 379, 1256, 1241, 960,

801, 682, 1369, 218, 437, 308, 979, 781, 602, 433,

1617, 126, 347, 492, 130, 372, 899, 1267, 382, 560,

1120, 697] MSH

Sspot,2 = [482, 859, 303, 1103, 881, 1008, 222, 1679, 1523, 2756,

2877, 2781, 2786, 2572, 2293, 670, 921, 1264, 1026] MSH

(B1)

(B2)

and the numbers of elements are n1 = 32 and n2 = 19. Using Student’s t-test (Welch’s t-test), we examine the null
hypothesis “µ1 = µ2” and the alternative hypothesis “µ1 < µ2” with the one-tailed test, where µ1 and µ2 are the
means of the parent populations.
The statistic t is deﬁned as

where X 1 and X 2 are the means of the two sample distributions, s2
X 2)2/(n2 − 1). From (B1) and (B2), we obtain t = −3.732.

and is calculated to be ν = 22.16, which is rounded to the nearest integer, ν∗ = 22.

The table relating the test statistics and degrees of freedom shows that t0.005(22) = 2.819 and t0.0005(22) = 3.792:

− t0.0005(22) < t < −t0.005(22).

(B5)

Therefore, the signiﬁcant probability is between 0.0005 and 0.005 and, at the 99.5% conﬁdence level, the null hypothesis
is rejected and we can conclude that the spot areas of the eruptive events are smaller than the non-eruptive events.

Next, we try the case without AR 12192, the largest spot group of the cycle. The spot areas without the six values

for AR 12192 is

Sspot,2 = [482, 859, 303, 1103, 881, 1008, 222, 1679, 1523, 670,

921, 1264, 1026] MSH

(B6)

and n2 = 13. Then, from (B1) and (B6), we obtain t = −1.967 and ν = 20.91 (ν∗ = 21). In this case, t0.05(21) = 1.721
and t0.025(21) = 2.080. Then, we ﬁnd that the probability falls in between 0.025 and 0.05 and that the null hypothesis
is rejected still at 95% conﬁdence.

The AR total ﬂux |Φ|AR for the eruptive and non-eruptive cases are

|Φ|AR,1 = [2.8, 2.8, 2.6, 2.9, 2.7, 2.5, 2.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8,
3.8, 3.2, 6.8, 1.5, 3.1, 2.4, 4.9, 5.0, 4.5, 3.0,

7.9, 1.1, 2.8, 3.3, 1.3, 4.3, 4.5, 5.3, 2.3, 2.7,
4.6, 3.8] × 1022 Mx

and

|Φ|AR,2 = [2.3, 3.4, 2.1, 5.2, 4.0, 4.4, 1.9, 7.6, 8.5, 14.0,

15.8, 16.6, 16.6, 15.8, 14.2, 2.9, 3.4, 5.3, 3.9] × 1022 Mx.

(B7)

(B8)

Magnetic Properties of Flaring Solar ARs

We obtain t = −3.229 and ν = 19.40 (ν∗ = 19). Since t0.005(19) = 2.861 and t0.0005(19) = 3.883, the probability is
between 0.005 and 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected at 99.5% conﬁdence, which is the same level as the test for
the spot areas including AR 12192.
