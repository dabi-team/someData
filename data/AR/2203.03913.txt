ABSTRACT

The decay index of solar magnetic ﬁelds is known as an important parameter in
regulating solar eruptions from the standpoint of the torus instability. In particu-
lar, a saddle-like proﬁle of decay index, which hosts a local torus-stable regime at
higher altitudes than where the decay index ﬁrst exceeds the instability threshold,
is found to be associated with some conﬁned or two-step eruptions. To understand
the occurrence of such a proﬁle, we employed dipoles to emulate diﬀerent kinds of
photospheric ﬂux distributions. Corroborated by observations of representative ac-
tive regions (ARs), our major results are: 1) in bipolar conﬁgurations the critical
height increases away from the AR center along the polarity inversion line (PIL) and
its average is roughly half of the centroid distance between opposite polarities; 2) in
quadrupolar conﬁgurations saddle-like proﬁles appear above the PIL when the two
dipoles oriented in the same direction are signiﬁcantly more separated in this direction
than in the perpendicular direction, and when the two dipoles are oriented diﬀerently
or have unequal ﬂuxes; 3) saddle-like proﬁles in quadrupolar conﬁgurations are as-
sociated with magnetic skeletons such as a null point or a hyperbolic ﬂux tube, and
the role of such proﬁles in eruptions is anticipated to be double-edged if magnetic
reconnection is involved.

Luo & Liu

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most energetic phenomena in
solar corona, which are considered as the diﬀerent manifestations of the same physical
process (Zhang et al. 2001, 2004; Priest & Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara 2011).
However, ﬂares that are associated with no CMEs are known as “conﬁned ﬂares” or
“failed eruptions” (e.g. Ji et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2019; Mrozek et al.
2020). Whether an eruption is successful or not is heavily dependent on the strapping
force exerted by the overlying magnetic ﬁeld on the eruptive structure (e.g., Török &
Kliem 2005; Guo et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2011; Zuccarello et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2015;
Myers et al. 2015; Amari et al. 2018), which is often a magnetic ﬂux rope (Vourlidas
et al. 2013; Liu 2020). A ﬂux rope undergoes the torus instability (Bateman 1978;
Kliem & Török 2006) when the magnitude of the overlying ﬁeld decreases with height
at a suﬃciently steep rate, quantiﬁed by the decay index n = −d ln B/d ln h (Bateman
1978) exceeding about 1.5; the corresponding height is referred to as the critical
height. Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that the theoretical critical value of
ncr = 1.5 adopted in many studies as well as in this study is derived from a thin,
toroidal current ring (Bateman 1978; Kliem & Török 2006). In practice, ncr typically
scatters around in a range as large as [0.8, 2] for diﬀerent theoretical considerations
(e.g., Démoulin & Aulanier 2010; Olmedo & Zhang 2010), observational studies (e.g.,
Jing et al. 2018; Duan et al. 2019), numerical simulations (e.g., Török & Kliem 2007;
Fan & Gibson 2007), and laboratory experiments (e.g., Myers et al. 2015; Alt et al.
2021). Obviously, ncr is a function of the ﬂux-rope parameters including the geometry
and internal current proﬁle, yet the discrepancy in diﬀerent studies is also aﬀected by
where the decay index is computed (Zuccarello et al. 2016; Alt et al. 2021).

The CME-productivity of some active regions (ARs) are found to be eﬀectively
regulated by the decay index: ARs that produce mostly conﬁned ﬂares (e.g., AR
12192; Liu et al. 2016a) have signiﬁcantly lower decay indices than those productive in
eruptive ﬂares (e.g., AR 11158; Sun et al. 2015). Based on the pre-ﬂare extrapolation
of the coronal ﬁeld, MFRs experiencing failed eruptions are found to stay within the
torus-stable regime during the entire eruptive process (e.g., Wang et al. 2015; Zou
et al. 2019). Wang et al. (2017) analyzed 60 two-ribbon ﬂares and found that the
critical heights for conﬁned ﬂares is higher than those for eruptive ones.

A saddle-like decay-index proﬁle is ﬁrst reported by Guo et al. (2010), often ex-
hibiting a local torus-stable regime sandwiched by two torus-unstable regimes. Wang
et al. (2017) noticed such a proﬁle for 16% (14%) of conﬁned (eruptive) ﬂares, with
n at the saddle bottom being signiﬁcantly smaller in conﬁned ﬂares than that in
eruptive ones. In another statistical study, Baumgartner et al. (2018) found saddle-
like n(h) proﬁles in 46% of their sample of 44 M5.0-and-above ﬂares. It is suggested
that there might be an additional conﬁning eﬀect if the saddle bottom is below the
critical value, which might be the case for some failed eruptions (Wang et al. 2017;
Liu et al. 2018a; Li et al. 2019; Mitra et al. 2021) or two-step eruptions, in which the

Saddle-like decay index

rising of the eruptive structure is temporarily slowed or even halted before developing
into a CME (e.g., Liu et al. 2007; Gosain et al. 2016; Chandra et al. 2017). However,
saddle-like proﬁles are also present in successful eruptions (e.g., Liu et al. 2015; Wang
et al. 2017; Baumgartner et al. 2018; Joshi et al. 2021). In the data-driven numerical
experiments by Inoue et al. (2018), an MFR loses equilibrium in an torus-unstable
regime but even further accelerate in the torus-stable regime of the saddle shape.

Saddle-like proﬁles tend to be present in complex, multipolar ARs (Wang et al.
2017). It is suggested that the associated magnetic conﬁguration may possess two
suﬃciently diﬀerent spatial scales (Filippov 2018; Kliem et al. 2021). Here, we focus
on the genesis of saddle-like decay-index proﬁles by idealized numeric experiments
with magnetic dipoles. In the sections that follow, we present our methodology of
using dipoles to emulate coronal background ﬁeld in Section 2; we then focus on
where saddle-like proﬁles are present in the background ﬁeld emulated by dipole and
quadrupole ﬁeld, respectively, and compare these results with the background ﬁeld of
a few representative active regions approximated by potential-ﬁeld extrapolations in
Section 3; we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss their implications in Section 4.

2. METHODOLOGY

In view of the torus instability, an expanding toroidal ﬂux ring can be constrained
by an external poloidal ﬁeld until its decay index n ≥ 1.5 (Kliem & Török 2006). In
the corona, this external ﬁeld is often approximated by a potential ﬁeld extrapolated
from the photospheric ﬁelds because, on one hand, it is diﬃcult to distinguish the
external ﬁeld from that produced by the electric current ﬂowing through a ﬂux rope,
and on the other hand, the potential ﬁeld is usually perpendicular to the magnetic
polarity inversion line (PIL, which separates magnetic ﬂuxes of opposite polarities)
along which a coronal ﬂux rope is often aligned (e.g., Török & Kliem 2007; Fan &
Gibson 2007; Liu 2008; Démoulin & Aulanier 2010). The magnetic ﬁeld produced by
a magnetic dipole satisﬁes ∇ × B = 0, which is strictly potential. We thus employ
dipoles to emulate the coronal background ﬁeld above ARs, and focus on the spatial
distribution of decay index.

We selected ﬁve ARs with either a bipolar or quadrupolar conﬁguration to compare
with the dipole or quadrupole results, respectively. Magnetograms monitoring these
ARs are obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Hoeksema et al.
2014) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), which was
launched on 2010 February 11. The potential ﬁeld to emulate the coronal background
ﬁeld above the ARs is extrapolated from the radial component of photospheric vector
magnetograms by a Fourier transformation method (Alissandrakis 1981).

Luo & Liu

A dipole ﬁeld can be written as

B(r) =

3(m · r)r
r5

−

m
r3 ,

(1)

where m is the dipole moment and r the displacement vector. The plane at a height
h0 above the dipole moment, where the bipolar ﬂux distribution (Fig. 1a) shares
similarities with a pair of sunspots with opposite polarities, is taken as a pseudo
photosphere. In other words, the horizontal dipole m = m ex is placed at (0, 0, −h0)
in the Cartesian coordinate system. Right above the PIL, which is along the y-axis,
the magnetic ﬁeld can be written as

BPIL(r) = −

(2)

where h is the height above the photosphere and D is the linear distance from a point
on the PIL to the origin. The decay index right above the PIL is then given as follows,

nPIL =

3h(h + h0)
D2 + (h + h0)2 .

(3)

The critical height hcr is deﬁned as the height where nPIL = 1.5. In a dipole ﬁeld,

hcr = (h2

0 + D2)

2 .

(4)

We deﬁne the centroid distance dc as the linear distance between the centroids
of opposite polarities in the pseudo photosphere. The ﬂux-weighted centroid of the
positive polarity, e.g., is (xc, yc) = ((cid:82) xBz dA/ (cid:82) Bz dA, (cid:82) yBz dA/ (cid:82) Bz dA), where
Bz > 0. We obtain dc in terms of the depth of the dipole h0, i.e.,

hcr can then be expressed in terms of dc to facilitate the comparison with observations,

dc = πh0.

hcr =

(cid:18) d2

(6)

Taking the average critical height ¯hcr over the PIL from D = −0.7dc to 0.7dc, we
found

¯hcr (cid:39) dc/2.

(7)

From Eq. 3 one can see that the decay index n increases monotonically with the
increasing height above the photosphere, which leaves no room for a saddle shaped
n(h) proﬁle. Hence, below we investigate the decay index in quadrupole ﬁelds.

3.2. Quadrupole ﬁelds

In quadrupole ﬁelds, it becomes diﬃcult to derive hcr analytically. Hence, similar to
Sun et al. (2013) and Liu et al. (2016b), we placed two horizontal dipoles at the same
depth below a Cartesian computation domain (−255.5 < x, y < 255.5, 0 < z < 511).
They yield together a potential ﬁeld above the z = 0 plane, which is again taken as
the photosphere. Note in the 2D model of Filippov (2018), two dipoles are placed
at diﬀerent depths to generate the background ﬁeld with two diﬀerent spatial scales
above the surface. Here for simplicity, m1’s ﬂux distribution at the z = 0 plane,
termed “BP1” hereafter, is maintained constant, and m1 is always oriented in the
x-direction. We adjust m2’s ﬂux distribution at the z = 0 plane, termed “BP2”
hereafter, to produce diﬀerent quadrupole conﬁgurations. The centroid distance dc
of each individual dipole is the same by Eq. 5 and taken as the unit length in the
following analysis.

Two types of saddle-like proﬁles nsdl(h) can be distinguished, based on whether the
local maximum value at the saddle top nt is above ncr and the local minimum value
at the saddle bottom nb is below ncr. Saddle-like proﬁles satisfying nb < ncr < nt
(e.g., Fig 1g) only occur above the inter-bipole PIL, i.e., the external PIL of each
individual bipole but internal PIL of the quadrupole. This type of saddle-like proﬁles
crosses the ncr = 1.5 line for at least three times, which is denoted by nm
sdl(h) hereafter.
Other saddle shapes satisfying either nb > ncr or nt < ncr (e.g., Fig. 1(h & i)) are
found above the intra-bipole PIL, mostly located close to the center of each individual
sdl(h) hereafter.
bipole. They cross the ncr = 1.5 line only once, which is denoted by ns

3.2.1. Parameters regulating the occurrence of nsdl(h)

In observation, saddle-like n(h) proﬁles are found exclusively in multipolar ARs
(Wang et al. 2017). We simulate ﬁve types of quadrupole ﬁeld conﬁgurations con-
sidering three parameters of BP2 relative to BP1, namely, position (Fig 1(b,c,e)),
direction (Fig 1f), and intensity (Fig 1d). The bipole direction, pointing from posi-
tive to negative polarity, is opposite to that of the corresponding dipole moment m.
The PIL segments above which the n(h) proﬁles become saddle shaped are denoted
by solid lines, while those above which n(h) increases monotonically with height are
denoted by dashed lines.

For simplicity we ﬁrst consider two dipoles that are not only placed at the same
depth but have the same orientation and strength. In comparison to a single dipole
(Figure 1a), the introduction of a second dipole aligned in the same direction pro-
duces saddle shaped n(h) proﬁles above the major segments of the PIL (Figure 1b).
Since this conﬁguration is similar to the breakout model (Antiochos et al. 1999), the
resultant n(h) breaks into two branches near the height where a coronal null point
is present (see the yellow curve in Fig. 1g; see also Fig.3 in Török & Kliem 2007),
which can be considered as a saddle shaped proﬁle in the extreme, as n is singular at

6

Luo & Liu

the null point. In contrast, saddle shaped n(h) are mostly absent above the PIL, i.e.,
n increases monotonically with height, if BP1 and BP2 are aligned in the direction
perpendicular to the bipole direction (Fig. 1e).

Next, we relax the constraint on the orientation and strength of BP2. It seems that
the broken of symmetry by either rotating (Fig. 1f) or weaken BP2 relative to BP1
(Fig. 1d) facilitates the production of saddle shaped n(h). In particular, such proﬁles
are preferentially found close to the weaker BP (Fig. 1d).

3.2.2. Occurrence rate of nsdl(h) above PIL

To quantify the probability of encountering saddle-like n(h) proﬁles above the PIL

in quadrupole ﬁelds, we deﬁne the “saddle occurrence rate” as follows,

Rsdl =

Lsdl
L

,

(8)

where L is the length of the PIL from the center of BP1 to that of BP2, and Lsdl
denotes the length of the PIL segments above which nsdl(h) appears. Similarly, we
may obtain the occurrence rate of nm

sdl(h) among saddle-shaped proﬁles, i.e.,

Rm

sdl =

Lm
sdl
Lsdl

.

(9)

We set the height of the computational domain by the displacement of m2 relative
to m1 in each individual quadrupole conﬁgurations. The result has been checked
against those obtained in larger computational domains, but we found no qualitative
diﬀerence.

First, two bipoles are set to be parallel to each other and have equal magnitude,
but m2 is displaced with respect to m1 by ∆x and ∆y in the X and Y direction,
in this ∆x–∆y space are indicated
respectively. The distributions of Rsdl and Rm
sdl
by colors (Fig 2 (a) & (b)). One can see that ∆y/∆x is an important parameter
in regulating the occurrence rate of saddle shaped n(h) above the PIL, i.e., Rsdl
becomes signiﬁcant (> 0.4) when ∆y/∆x < 1.1 and Rm
starts to appear (> 0.1)
sdl
when ∆y/∆x < 0.8.

Next, as mentioned above, the angle θ between m1 and m2 can inﬂuence the gen-
eration of saddle shaped n(h). We set up a quadrupole conﬁguration with an initial
∆x = 0 (e.g., Fig. 1e) to ensure the absence of nsdl(h), and then we change m2’s
orientation to provide diﬀerent θ. In Fig. 2c the saddle occurrence rate Rsdl increases
with θ, when θ exceeds a threshold value (∼ 90◦), but soon becomes saturated when
θ ∼ [130, 145]◦, and thence decrease gradually. At θ = 180◦, however, Rsdl suddenly
drops to nearly 0, because this symmetric conﬁguration possesses a single null point
above the center. Only through the null point does the decay-index proﬁle become ex-
tremely saddle-like (cf. the yellow curve in Fig. 1g). Apparently, the threshold value

Saddle-like decay index

sdl(h).

depends on other parameters of the quadrupole conﬁguration; e.g., the appearance of
sdl(h) requires a higher θ threshold than ns
nm
Finally, we keep m1 constant and weaken m2 continuously to emulate asymmetric
quadrupolar regions with unbalanced magnetic ﬂux between two pairs of sunspots
(Fig. 1d). We divide PIL into two segments; namely, PIL1, which is close to BP1,
and PIL2, which is close to BP2, based on the distance to the ﬂux-weighted center
of each pair of sunspots. The total saddle generation rate Rsdl above the entire PIL
(black), Rsdl,1 above PIL1 (blue), and Rsdl,2 above PIL2 (red) are shown in Fig 2 (d),
One can see that saddle-shaped n(h) tends to appear above the PIL belonging to the
weaker sunspot pair.

3.3. Background ﬁelds of ARs

Here we investigate a few selected active regions that have simple conﬁgurations,
typically composed of either one or two pairs of major sunspots with opposite polar-
ities, so that they can be emulated by either one or two dipoles. We further compare
the decay index of the AR background ﬁelds that are approximated by a potential
ﬁeld with those emulated by dipoles.

3.3.1. Bipolar active regions

Three ARs, NOAA 12192, 11166, and 11428, which have two major sunspots of
opposite polarities, are shown in Fig 3. The centroid distance dc is again given as
the linear distance between the ﬂux-weighted centroids of opposite polarities, and the
midpoint is taken as the AR center (yellow triangles in Fig. 3(a–c)). The color-coded
decay index n as a function of height above the PIL is plotted along the PIL (Fig. 3(d–
f)), whose origin is designated as the closest point to the AR center (yellow circles in
Fig. 3(a–c)). The decay index n increases monotonically with increasing height above
almost all segments of PIL. We took the average of hcr over the PIL points whose arc
length from the PIL origin along the PIL ranges from −0.7dc to 0.7dc (thick curves in
Fig. 3(a–c)), and found that this average value, ¯hcr, is approximately dc/2, consistent
with Eq. 7.

To further compare with the dipole model, we show hcr as a function of D, the
linear distance from a PIL point to the AR center (Fig. 3(g–i)). hcr obtained for
PIL segments to the north (south) of the PIL origin is denoted in blue (red) colors.
That hcr increases with the linear distance from the AR center suggests that magnetic
structures located on the outskirts of a bipolar AR generally experience a stronger
conﬁnement imposed by the background ﬁeld than those close to the AR center. An
overall consistency between hcr obtained from the potential-ﬁeld approximation and
those from the dipole ﬁeld is demonstrated by Fig. 3(g–i), in which the dashed curves
are given by Eq. 4, with h0 replaced by the critical height at the PIL origin obtained
in the potential ﬁeld.

3.3.2. Quadrupolar active regions

Here the coronal background ﬁelds of two exemplary ARs that consist of two major
pairs of sunspots are compared with those idealized by a quadrupole ﬁeld consisting
of a pair of dipoles.

AR 11158 (Fig. 4a) can be emulated by a pair of dipoles which diﬀer in both location
and orientation as well as slightly in intensity (Fig. 4b). The n(h) proﬁles plotted
along the PIL (similar to Fig. 3(d–f)) again demonstrate an overall similarity between
the background ﬁeld approximated by potential ﬁeld and that by a pair of dipoles. We
also plot n(h) proﬁles at three speciﬁc locations in Fig 4(g1–g3). Both n(h) proﬁles
sdl(h), which crosses the n = 1.5
at Location 1 and Location 3 can be categorized as ns
sdl(h), which crosses
line only once, but those at Location 2 can be categorized as nm
the n = 1.5 line at least three times. A reversal in the transverse ﬁeld component
Bt and a strongly enhanced squashing factor Q (Titov et al. 2002) are found above
Location 2 at similar heights in both the potential ﬁeld and the quadrupole ﬁeld (red
and blue curves, respectively, in Fig. 4(h2 & i2)), which will be discussed in §4.3.

Fig 5 shows a quadrupolar region composed of two bipolar ARs, NOAA 11504
and 11505. To emulate this quadrupolar ﬁeld, we adopted two dipoles which have
similar orientation but are relatively displaced only in the direction perpendicular
to the dipole orientation. The n(h) proﬁles show a similar trend, i.e., increasing
monotonically with height, over the major PIL.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The similarity in the distribution of n(h) both along and above the PIL between
the AR background ﬁelds approximated by potential-ﬁeld extrapolations and those
emulated by dipoles (§3.3) suggests that the qualitative results that we learn from
dipole and quadrupole ﬁelds (§3.1 & §3.2) can be applied to some simple ARs with
caution. Hence below we summarize the major results obtained from this investigation
using dipoles.

4.1. Critical height in dipole ﬁelds

In the dipole ﬁeld, we found that the critical height averaged over above the major
PIL in the core region [−0.7dc, 0.7dc] is approximately half of the centroid distance
dc (Eq. 7). This is consistent with the statistics of two-ribbon ﬂares by Wang et al.
(2017, their Eq. (1)). Similarly, Kliem et al. (2014) found that hcr is slightly below
the half distance between two magnetic charges serving as the external ﬁeld for a ﬂux
rope. These results generally imply that the bipolar ARs that have a large centroid
distance between opposite polarities also have a large critical height, therefore pro-
viding strong conﬁnement to underlying non-potential structures. This is reminiscent
of the extremely large AR 12192, which produced 32 M- and 6 X-class ﬂares but only

one CME (Liu et al. 2016a). Eq. 6 further implies that hcr increases with increasing
distance from the center of a bipolar region. However, this appears to contradict some
observations, in which conﬁned ﬂares are located closer to the ﬂux-weighted magnetic
center than eruptive ones in the same AR (e.g., Wang & Zhang 2007; Cheng et al.
2011; Baumgartner et al. 2018). We note that the ARs in these studies are often
far more complex than bipolar regions that we tried to emulate here with a dipole,
also the overlying ﬁeld of an eruptive structure located in the AR periphery must be
modulated by the magnetic ﬁeld of neighboring ARs (e.g., Figure 5), which is seldom
taken into account in previous studies.

4.2. Occurrence condition of nsdl(h) in quadrupole ﬁelds

Placing two dipoles at the same depth below a plane taken as the photosphere,
we found two types of saddle shaped n(h) proﬁles in quadrupole ﬁelds: those cross
the n = 1.5 line multiple times and those cross the same line only once. The former,
sdl(h), is found only above the inter-bipole PIL between two bipoles, while the latter,
nm
sdl(h), is close to and inside each bipole, i.e., mainly above the intra-bipole PIL.
ns
We investigated three parameters regulating the generation of saddle shaped n(h),

namely, the relative location, orientation, and magnitude of the two dipoles.

• For two parallel dipoles, the rate of nsdl(h) along the PIL becomes signiﬁcant
(Rsdl > 0.4) when their relative displacement along the dipole direction is larger
than that perpendicular to the dipole direction; nm
sdl(h) appears when the former
displacement is signiﬁcantly larger than the latter.

• nsdl(h) appears more frequently above the PIL with larger angle between the

two dipoles.

• nsdl(h) tends to appear above the PIL segments closer to the bipole that is

weaker in terms of unsigned ﬂux.

4.3. Can nsdl(h) provide additional constraint for eruptive structure?

The saddle shaped proﬁle nsdl(h), especially nm

sdl(h), provides a zone of stability
for an eruptive structure when it rises to the height corresponding to the bottom
of the saddle where n < ncr.
It appears to be the case in some conﬁned ﬂares
(e.g., Liu et al. 2018a) or two-step eruptions (e.g., Gosain et al. 2016). However,
it is also found that eruptions tend to occur at the “external PIL” of bipolar ARs
(Yardley et al. 2018), which suggests that remote active regions might also play a
role, or at the “collisional PIL” between two pairs of sunspots within quadrupolar ARs
(Chintzoglou et al. 2019). In both occasions, a saddle-like proﬁle is likely present,
from our experience of quadrupole ﬁelds (§3.2).

Further investigating the characteristics of magnetic ﬁeld, we found that in
quadrupole ﬁelds, the saddle-like decay-index proﬁle is associated with a strong varia-

10

tion of magnetic connectivity; it is hence also associated with a signiﬁcant rotation of
the transverse ﬁeld component Bt, whose magnitude Bt = (cid:112)B2
, with respect
to the photospheric PIL (see also Filippov 2020). In the example shown in Fig 6, two
dipoles are relatively displaced but have the same orientation, strength and depth
(Fig 6a). Two quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; Titov et al. 2002) can be seen as the
isosurfaces of logarithmic squashing factor, log10 Q = 3.5. Their footprints at the
pseudo photosphere are shown as the blue and red lines in the map of signed log10 Q
(Fig 6b). Such two QSLs intersecting each other are collectively known as a hyper-
bolic ﬂux tube (HFT), whose intersections continuously transform from one end to
the other (Titov et al. 2002), and in the center the intersection exhibits a typical X-
shaped morphology (Fig 6c). In the cross section above the inter-bipole PIL (marked
sdl(h) is present (Fig 6(d)), one can see
by the thick curve in Fig 6(a & b)) where nm
that with increasing height the decay index changes from over ncr = 1.5 (reddish) to
below it (blueish) near where the two QSLs intersect to give an X shape. Near the X
shape, magnetic ﬁeld lines are roughly parallel to the PIL (magenta); but below and
above, they become increasingly perpendicular to the PIL (yellowish and greenish,
respectively). Right above the center of the PIL (Fig 6(e–g)), one can see that the
peak of log10 Q corresponds to where n decreases most rapidly and to where the ﬁeld
lines rotate with respect to the PIL (shaded bar).

For the background ﬁeld of the representative AR 11158 as approximated by both
potential ﬁeld and two dipoles (Figure 4), we see similar height variation of various
parameters, i.e., a reversal of the angle ϕ between Bt and PIL is associated with
sdl(h) is
strongly enhanced Q, along the PIL segment between sunspot pairs, where nm
present (e.g., Location 2 in Figure 4 and panels (g2, h2, j2)). Along the PIL segments
within the sunspot pairs (e.g., Locations 3 in Figure 4), where only ns
sdl(h) is present,
ﬁeld lines rotate within a much smaller range without an orientation reversal with
respect to PIL, despite the enhanced Q. An exception is found at Location 1, where
n(h) is not exactly saddle-like in the potential-ﬁeld extrapolation, despite that the
sdl(h) proﬁle. Location 1 is located at the intra-
quadrupole ﬁeld gives an untypical ns
bipole PIL of the sunspot pair in the northwest of AR 11158. Compared with its
southeastern counterpart, this pair is quite sprawled and its opposite polarities are
highly sheared, which may contribute to the poor performance of the dipole in this
region. Overall, unlike the relatively gradual rotation of the ﬁeld lines, the drastic
changes in magnetic connectivity as measured by the mapping of ﬁeld-line footpoints,
i.e., the squashing factor Q, can obviously serve as a more sensitive indicator for the
presence of a saddle-shaped decay-index proﬁle.

Imagine that initially a low-lying MFR aligned along the PIL is strapped by the
downward Lorentz force between the axial current Ja of the MFR and the transverse
component Bt of the overlying ﬁeld, i.e., F = Ja Bt sin ϕ, where ϕ is the angle
between Ja and Bt and sin ϕ < 0 in the low atmosphere. One may argue that the

Saddle-like decay index

Lorentz force would turn upward, if the MFR somehow rose into the region where
the Bt orientation is reversed with respect to the PIL (Figure 6f). However, without
magnetic reconnection to open up the overlying ﬁeld, the rising MFR would just push
the overlying ﬁeld upward.

HFT is a preferential site for magnetic reconnection (Titov et al. 2002, 2003). When
a rising MFR impacts the overlying ﬁeld, the supposed reconnection between them
would reduce the overlying ﬂux and therefore weaken the constraining force, which
facilitates the MFR’s eruption, similar to the role of the null-point reconnection in
the breakout model (Antiochos et al. 1999). On the other hand, the reconnection
would shed magnetic twist from the MFR (e.g., Xue et al. 2016; Wyper et al. 2017;
Huang et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2019), causing a redistribution of magnetic helicity
over the larger system, and even the (partial) disintegration of the MFR (e.g., Liu
et al. 2018b; Yan et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2021), which hampers the MFR’s eruption.

To summarize, our study corroborates that the critical height is roughly half of the
centroid distance between opposite polarities in a dipole ﬁeld and clariﬁes where a
saddle-like decay-index proﬁle can be found in a quadrupole ﬁeld. With some caution,
these results can be applied to bipolar and quadupolar ARs, respectively. Our study
also reveals that saddle-like proﬁles may be associated with magnetic skeletons, such
as a null point (cf. Fig. 1(b & g)) or an HFT (Fig. 6), which is anticipated to serve
as a “double-edged sword” in eruptive processes in case magnetic reconnection with
the eruptive structure taking place at such skeletons: reconnection may open up the
overlying ﬁeld, facilitating the eruption, but at the same time shed the ﬂux of the
eruptive structure, causing its disintegration or even failed eruption. Thus, the zone of
stability at the saddle may indeed provide some constraint for the eruptive structure.
This may explain the mixing results obtained in observational studies, as mentioned
in the beginning of §4.3.
