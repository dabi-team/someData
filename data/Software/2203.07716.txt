Abstract—The upcoming sixth generation (6G) network is
envisioned to be more open and heterogeneous than earlier
generations. This challenges conventional security architectures,
which typically rely on the construction of a security perimeter
at network boundaries. In this article, we propose a software-
deﬁned zero trust architecture (ZTA) for 6G networks, which is
promising for establishing an elastic and scalable security regime.
This architecture achieves secure access control through adaptive
collaborations among the involved control domains, and can
effectively prevent malicious access behaviors such as distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware spread, and zero-day
exploits. We also introduce key design aspects of this architecture
and show the simulation results of a case study, which shows the
effectiveness and robustness of ZTA for 6G. Furthermore, we
discuss open issues to further promote this new architecture.

I. INTRODUCTION

Currently, the sixth-generation (6G) network is being ex-
tensively studied. One key challenge is on the security issue.
6G is envisioned to provide globally seamless connections to
trillions of humans, machines, and things [1]. Many types of
such devices have weak security capabilities, and can be easily
compromised to engage in malicious activities. Meanwhile, the
wide application of open-source software technologies also
introduces security risks caused by software vulnerabilities.
Worse yet, 6G is an open and space-air-ground integrated
network, existing perimeter-based security solutions such as
ﬁrewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs), may lead to
poor defense effects [2]. It becomes necessary to build more
elastic security architectures to satisfy the requirements of 6G.
To bridge this gap, a collaborative zero trust architecture
(ZTA) for 6G is developed in this article. This architecture
considers the network control domains as communities and
harmonizes them to implement sophisticated access control
their internal network entities. In particular, a
to protect
decentralized network access control regime is established
through adaptive collaborations among the involved control
domains. Considering the limitations of communities in terms
of available resources, blockchain-based third-party security
services are introduced to provide computing power and global
information support. By simulating the worm spreading pro-
cess in communities, this architecture can effectively defend
against the spread of computer viruses, distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits through dy-
namic access control of the cross-community access behaviors
of user equipment (UE). To facilitate the implementation of
this ZTA, we present open issues for future research, such as

II. CHALLENGES IN 6G SECURITY

A. Attack model

UEs and network entities in 6G networks are vulnerable
to many types of threats. The authentication mechanisms in
6G may fail to prevent legitimate but compromised UEs from
engaging in malicious activities [3]. We summarize malicious
behaviors in the network and transport layers, including DDoS
attacks, malware, and zero-day exploits.

• DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks are expected to be more
serious for 6G. Many insecure internet of things (IoT)
devices may provide attackers with large-scale malicious
trafﬁc. However, widely used edge servers have weaker
mitigation capabilities against DDoS attacks. UEs are also
vulnerable to DDoS attacks.

• Malware. Malware is a common software tool for a large
number of malicious behaviors. There are many types of
malware, such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses,
ransomware and rootkits. Malware is usually designed to
steal data and disrupt the operation of software systems,
thereby causing damage to 6G networks.

• Zero-day exploits. Zero-day exploits are another type of
software-based malicious behavior. Software vulnerability
is often difﬁcult to avoid. Because 6G networks widely
adopt open-source software to implement network entity
functions, attackers can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities to
adversely affect network functions.

B. Security challenges

We summarize new security challenges for 6G as follows.
• Ultra large scale. As an ultra-large-scale network, 6G
places an extremely high demand on the scalability of the
security architecture. High-Complexity architectures may
not be cost effective or even inapplicable at this scale.
• Heterogeneity. The heterogeneous networks in 6G will
probably be managed by multiple operators with different
management architectures and signaling systems. Col-
laboration among different control domains with various
management modes is essential for the security architec-
tures in 6G. A centralized architecture will probably fail
to meet these requirements.

• Diversity of UEs. The main UE types for 6G networks are
machines and devices. The resources and capabilities of
these UEs vary widely. The security architecture should
be lightweight. Resource-consuming operations, such as
end-to-end encryption, cannot be used as a secure basis
for security architectures.

C. ZTA and its limitations in 6G

ZTA was proposed to protect digital resources in local
networks in a dynamic way, the core idea of which is “never
trust and always verify." [4], [5] When traditional network
boundaries are blurred, it becomes quite suitable for dynamic
access control to avoid security problems. Several enterprises
have conducted relevant technical research and engineering
practices. Gartner proposed the adaptive security architecture
(ASA) in 2014 and gradually developed it into the zero trust
network access (ZTNA). Google has developed the Beyond-
Corp security model based on its own internal network security
governance requirements since 2014 [6]. A report surveyed
more than 400 cybersecurity decision makers and revealed that
72% of organizations plan to assess or implement zero trust
capabilities before 2021. Gartner predicted that 60% of these
enterprises will migrate to ZTNA by 2023 [7].

However, the existing ZTAs cannot overcome the security
challenges faced by 6G networks. First, current ZTAs im-
plement ﬁne-grained access control strategies to protect all
data resources and computing services [8]. This characteristic
cannot cope with the challenges introduced by the ultra large-
scale of 6G networks. Second, existing ZTAs are mainly
designed for a single network domain with a logically cen-
tralized controller. They cannot be applied to heterogeneous
6G networks with decentralized management architectures.
Third, end-to-end encryption is mandatory for existing ZTAs
[5]. Massive IoT terminals in 6G networks cannot meet this
requirement owing to resource limitations. Lastly, existing
ZTAs aim to prevent data breaches and limit internal lateral
movement. They cannot satisfy the security requirements of
6G, such as the prevention of ﬂooding attacks. Although the
newly emerged software-deﬁned perimeter (SDP) technology
[9] has extended the concept of ZTA to the network and
transport layers, there are still few considerations of other
challenges. The tailoring of ZTA for 6G large-scale network
security has become an important issue.

III. ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE FOR 6G

We introduce the key design aspects of ZTA for 6G, which
include the distributed security architecture, decentralized
identity management, and trust system.

A. Distributed security architecture

As 6G is an integrated network operated by many different
operators, the SDN-based control architecture should be dis-
tributed and adaptive. For example, in remote areas, distributed
control architectures are suitable for efﬁciency considerations,
whereas in urban areas, a hierarchical control architecture is
required for scalability [10]. To ensure its deployability, the
ZTA for 6G must be adapted to the hybrid control architecture.
As shown in Fig. 1, a community is a subnetwork managed
by a local SDN controller in 6G. The security function of
communities in ZTA is to perform access control at bor-
der switches to protect the internal equipment from external
threats. The access control framework for the communities
is shown in Fig. 2. The access control proxy on the data
plane submits visitors’ access requests to the control plane
for disposal, and then implements the returned access con-
trol decisions. The control plane includes three modules, an

and trust evaluation engine (TEE). The SPE completes the
formulation of access control strategies for speciﬁc access
requests with the support of TEE. The TEE evaluates the trust-
worthiness of visitors based on third-party security assessment
results. The identity management module is responsible for the
identity veriﬁcation and certiﬁcate approval of all UEs in the
community. In addition, there are two databases to store the
vulnerability ﬁxing logs and access logs of UEs, respectively.
To overcome the resource and information limitations of
the communities, we introduce third-party security services
(TPSSs) based on public blockchains, including the vulnera-
bility database (VDB), cybersecurity event ledger (CEL) and
anomalous behavior detector (ABD). The VDB provides risk
assessment services to the TEE of the accessed community by
analyzing recent vulnerability releases and vulnerability ﬁxing
logs related to the guest UE. The risk levels of vulnerable UEs
are determined by the type and harmfulness of unﬁxed vulner-
abilities. The CEL checks if the guest UE has communicated
with a virus-infected UE and if it has accessed the victims
during recent attack events by searching the records obtained
through victim reports and network forensics. ABD performs
behavior analysis using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques and
explores potential security risks based on the guest UE’s recent
access behaviors. The behavior analysis request is usually
initiated by the TEE of the accessed community, and the
guest UE’s home community provides historical access logs
on demand. In applications, the blockchain technology enables
data integrity and availability for the TPSSs.

When a UE initiates an access request, the home community
evaluates and blocks the request
if the UE is potentially
malicious. After self-evaluation, the UE’s digital identity and
related security certiﬁcations are submitted to the accessed
community for evaluation. In the accessed community, trust
evaluation is completed in collaboration with TPSSs. When
necessary, the SPE sends assessment requests to the TPSS after
accepting an access request from the data plane. The TPSS
assesses the security risk and returns the results to the TEE.
The TEE calculates the trust value based on the feedback from
the TPSS and relays the results to the SPE. The SPE makes
access control decisions according to the community’s security
control policies and trust value received from the TEE. This
community-based security architecture can effectively adapt to
the large scale and heterogeneity of 6G networks.

B. Decentralized identity management

Identity is the most important infrastructure in ZTAs. In
6G, it is very difﬁcult to establish and maintain a uniﬁed
identity system due to more diversiﬁed network equipment
suppliers, network operators and heterogeneous network struc-
tures. The dynamically allocated IP addresses cannot be used
including IPv6, because they can be easily
as identities,
spoofed. Therefore, identity management is one of the primary
challenges for ZTA in 6G. Traditional identity authentica-
tion schemes based on data certiﬁcates cannot satisfy the
requirements of access control in 6G. In centralized identity
management schemes, a uniﬁed certiﬁcation authority (CA)

3

issues certiﬁcates for all requesting UEs, which restricts the
scalability of the entire system. If multiple CAs are employed,
the problem of mutual trust cannot be resolved. In totally dis-
tributed identity management schemes, if the service provider
(e.g.,
the web servers) issues a digital certiﬁcate to each
potential visitor, a UE may retain too many digital certiﬁcates.

In fact, a unique identity across the entire network is not
only unnecessary but also leads to privacy issues. Digital
twin technologies have provided us with a distributed iden-
tity mechanism based on blockchain [11]. However, such a
uniﬁed identity system requires additional privacy protection
measures for user data. The complex calculations involved
may limit the efﬁciency and scalability of access control in
6G enabled IoTs. To this end, we propose a decentralized
identity management scheme based on digital certiﬁcates. In
this scheme, the certiﬁcate can be generated by either the
UE or the home communities. The local controller of each
community is the only CA responsible for the authentication of
digital certiﬁcates. The community-based identity management
scheme is illustrated in Fig. 3.

• Certiﬁcate generation. The digital certiﬁcate can be au-
tonomously generated by the UEs. The format of this
certiﬁcate can be customized by the community. The
certiﬁcate should specify the proof of identity, UE type,
operating system version, and other related information.
After generation, certiﬁcates should be packaged and
encrypted, and then submitted to the local controller for
review. The community only needs to ﬁle and manage au-
thorized certiﬁcates. This scheme can effectively alleviate
controller workload. Considering the resource limitations
of UEs, certiﬁcates can also be generated by the home
community.

• Certiﬁcate registration. The community controller de-
crypts the submitted certiﬁcate packets and veriﬁes rel-

information.

and self-evaluation. In addition, the TBSSs implement trust-
level assessments based on the CEL, vulnerability information,
and behavioral data extracted from the home community.

The information used for trust evaluation, including identity
and behavioral data, is dependent on the trustworthiness of
the home community. If the home community maliciously
it
provides false UE identity information or forges logs,
seriously undermines the validity of the trust evaluation results
and affects the security performance of the access control
framework. Therefore, to ensure security performance, the
trustworthiness evaluation of communities must be established
as the trust root of the whole ZTA.

We introduce TPSSs as supervisors to evaluate the trustwor-
thiness of communities. To this end, we consider the trust level
of the home community as an important reference element in
the trust evaluation of the guest UE. VDB can maintain a
community vulnerability risk index through random probing
to comprehensively evaluate the timeliness of vulnerability
patching in the community, and impose indicator penalties on
fraud and deception. CEL can employ techniques such as event
traceability and network forensics to collect statistics on the
distribution of attackers, virus sources, and bots to form a
threat level evaluation index of communities. Similarly, ABD
can perform statistical analysis on the frequency of abnormal
access behaviors and other characteristics to generate a com-
munity behavior abnormality index. By incorporating these
community trust-level indices as part of the trust assessment
results of the guest UE, the approval probability of their access
requests can be affected.

By introducing trust levels of communities as a reference
in access control, community controllers can be effectively
encouraged to focus on improving security performance to
ensure the access authority of their customer UEs. Even though
data fraud may not be completely eliminated, such behaviors
can be effectively punished, thereby signiﬁcantly reducing the
occurrence probability of dishonest communities. Therefore,
the foundation of the entire trust system can be consolidated
to adapt to the openness of 6G.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed ZTA for 6G, that
is, ZTA-6G, we compare it with two security architectures,
Trust Based Packet Filtering (TBPF) [12] and Transparency
for better Internet Security (TRIS) [13]. TBPF was developed
to enable collaboration among multiple IDSs based on the
trust evaluation of nodes and IP addresses. TRIS was proposed
based on profound insights into DDoS attack defense, which
can be applied to the security defense of the entire network.
We set four communities, namely A, B, C and D, with 1,000

UEs each. We set links between A-B, A-C, B-D, and C-D.

We adopt the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model
[14] to simulate the spread of worms in communities. Al-
though remotely manipulating bots across communities can be
prevented in ZTA-6G, bot-herders can still manipulate infected
UEs within the same community to launch attacks. Multiple
attackers can launch zero-day DDoS attacks through cross-
community coordination. Before the attack is launched, we

signed. After signing with the controller’s private key,
the certiﬁcate is returned to the applicant UE as a legal
identiﬁer. The registration information of certiﬁcates can
be stored centrally on the controller or distributed on the
community’s private blockchain according to the security
requirements.

• Certiﬁcate updating. If a UE needs to update its digital
certiﬁcate, it updates the relevant content of the certiﬁcate,
such as the public key, and performs the certiﬁcate
generation and registration process again. The controller
can use the original certiﬁcate ID. It sufﬁces to review,
resign and return it to its holder.

• Certiﬁcate revocation. When necessary, the digital iden-
tity can be revoked. During certiﬁcate revocations, the
controller cancels the certiﬁcate ID from the identity
database. The controller can also implement a certiﬁcate
revocation by setting a short validity period.

Based on this identity authentication scheme, UE identiﬁca-
tion can be achieved through hierarchical retrieval by introduc-
ing community identiﬁers (IDs). Speciﬁcally, an integrated UE
identity consists of three parts: an autonomous system number
(ASN), community ID, and certiﬁcate ID. The ASN is unique
within the entire 6G network. The community ID needs to be
unique within the AS to which it belongs, and the certiﬁcate
ID of a UE needs to be unique within the community in which
it resides. The ASN and community ID should be attached as
identiﬁcation elements in cross-domain access. This design not
only meets the access control requirements of diversiﬁed UEs
in 6G but also increases the elasticity and scalability of the
identity management scheme.

C. Trust system

Trust evaluation is the process of quantifying trust values
based on the attributes that affect trust. Trust in communi-
cation networks comes from the observation of the historical
behaviors and recommendations of trusted third parties. In the
proposed ZTA, the trust evaluation system works as shown in
Fig. 4. The trustworthiness of a guest UE is preliminarily guar-
anteed by its home community through identity authentication

simulate a normal communication process lasting for 100 s
with a cross-domain access probability of 0.1 at a rate of 5
packets per second (pps). The initial number of infected UEs
is 100 per community. The infection and ﬁxing rates of the
vulnerability are both set to 0.2. Each period lasts for 1 second
repeatedly until all vulnerable UEs are ﬁxed. Because our
framework is inherently resistant to IP spooﬁng, we evaluate
the effectiveness of defense against non-spooﬁng attacks. The
infected UEs in B and C ﬁrst attack a victim in A, and then
the infected UEs in A, B, and C jointly attack the victim in D.
The attack intensity is set at 10 pps. We set the threshold of the
trust value in TBPF to 0.75, as suggested by the authors [12].
For ZTA-6G, we adopt the same trust evaluation method as for
TBPF. We collect the received attack packets at the victim side
in community D to evaluate the defense performance of each
architecture. The average results of 100 random simulations
are shown in Fig. 5.

As shown in Fig. 5, as the simulation process proceeds, the

defense effects of the three architectures generally improved,
wherein ZTA-6G always performs the best. TRIS cannot
defend against the ﬁrst attack of malicious UEs, so its defense
effect is the worst at the very beginning. The performance
of TBPF is better. ZTA-6G ﬁlters out the packets from UEs
with malicious behaviors in the source community by self-
evaluation and re-evaluates the trustworthiness of vulnerable
UEs in the destination community. Thus, it maintains the
highest ﬁltering rate of attack packets. Therefore, the number
of missed attack packets is minimal (as shown in the subﬁgure
below).

To verify the robustness of the ZTA-6G, we set different
validity periods for the trust evaluation results instead of
evaluating the trustworthiness of every access request. For the
evaluation results of UEs within the validity period, ZTA-6G
directly approves their access requests. Some UEs become
bots owing to virus infection during this period, resulting
in the degradation of security performance in terms of the

accumulative ﬁltering rate in non-spooﬁng DDoS attacks. We
set the validity period to 1, 3, 5, and 7 s to verify the changes
in the accumulated ﬁltering rate of the attack packets and the
number of missed attack packets by ZTA-6G. The average
results of 100 random simulations are shown in Fig. 6.

As the validity period increases, the accumulative ﬁltering
the
rate of attack packets shows a downward trend, but
rate of decline slows down. Implementing trust evaluation
every second (𝑝 = 1) performs the best, and its time cost
is the highest. For 𝑝 > 1, the accumulative ﬁltering rate
curves are wavy. This is because, after each re-evaluation, the
effectiveness of the evaluation results declines over time. For
𝑝 = 3 and 𝑝 = 5, ZTA-6G performs much better than TRIS
and TBPF. The accumulated detection rates are both higher
than 90%. Even if we re-evaluate the UE’s trust value once
every 7 s, the ﬁltering rates of attack packets can still be much
better than TRIS and are almost as good as TBPF. These
results demonstrate the robustness of ZTA-6G. In addition,
this also shows that it is feasible to sacriﬁce a small part of
the security performance to obtain a signiﬁcant improvement
in time efﬁciency according to the safety requirements in
applications.

V. OPEN ISSUES

To facilitate the implementation of ZTA-6G,

there are
still some open issues, such as system efﬁciency, mobility
management, trust evaluation and residual security risks.

A. System efﬁciency

In ZTA-6G, the delay caused by the trust evaluation process
may limit its application in delay-sensitive services. To reduce
transmission latency, content distribution technologies can be
used to deploy TPSSs so that communities can access their
services nearby. The on-demand extraction of behavioral logs
can be replaced by periodic active synchronization of each
community, thereby reducing transmission delay. The behavior
analysis algorithm can focus only on the correlation analysis
of incremental data to improve processing speed. In addition,
for UEs that frequently initiate access requests, TPSSs can
set a validity period for the security assessment results by at-
taching a digital signature to the UE’s identity certiﬁcate. The
accessed community can verify the digital signature instead of
initiating a new security service request. This mechanism can
avoid repeated security assessments within the validity period,
thereby reducing the response time for access authorization.

have veriﬁed the predictability of human behavioral patterns
[15], and the regularity of the movement patterns of unmanned
equipment may be more signiﬁcant. Because data handovers
caused by UE movement will only occur between adjacent
communities, it sufﬁces to perform data synchronization or
predelivery for several communities that may be involved in
the UE movement.

C. Trust evaluation

Trust evaluation methods face two major problems when
applied to ZTA in 6G. In parameter determination, the weights
of trust elements from different sources when calculating the
trust value are usually determined by experience, such as the
trust level of the community and UE. Moreover, the threshold
of trust values often has difﬁculty balancing generalization
and accuracy. There is no objective or quantitative parameter
selection method. One possible solution is to develop data-
driven trust evaluation methods based on federated learning
techniques. Considering that it is difﬁcult to collect sufﬁcient
behavioral data to train the learning models in a single
community, the accuracy of models for the same type of UE
will vary signiﬁcantly in different communities. Establishing
new model integration methods based on cross-community
collaboration is required.

D. Residual security risks

Because trust evaluation requires time, attackers may manip-
ulate bots to initiate a large number of access requests to the
control plane of ZTA-6G in a speciﬁc community, resulting
to cross-
in DDoS attacks. Although ZTA-6G is resistant
community manipulation and reuse of bots, an attacker could
still control massive numbers of bots in the same community
to launch such attacks. To solve this problem, a prescreening
mechanism for access requests in the data plane of ZTA-6G
is necessary. For example, prioritizing requests from repetitive
visitors. Multiple existing studies on mitigating DDoS attacks
against the SDN control plane can be referenced. In addition,
ZTA-6G focuses mainly on cross-community security access
and does not involve security issues within the community.
Although the internal security problems of communities can
be solved using existing methods, their integration with ZTA-
6G requires further research.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

B. Mobility management

ZTA-6G stores and manages the identities, behavioral data
and vulnerability ﬁxing information of UEs based on commu-
nities. When a UE moves, its home community can change.
The movement of network entities, such as satellites and
drones, may also lead to changes in management domains. For
delay-sensitive services, the handover management problem
should be studied to ensure the timeliness of access control
in the ZTA. A potential solution may arise from UE mobile
pattern prediction-based artiﬁcial intelligence. Many studies

To satisfy the new security requirements of 6G, we have
designed a software-deﬁned ZTA to collaboratively defend
against network threats. In the new architecture, the commu-
nity can implement sophisticated access control to guest UEs
with the help of trust assessment from TPSSs. Distributed
identity management is achieved through a newly designed
digital certiﬁcate system. The trust system of this architecture
is established by employing TPSSs as supervisors to solidify
the trust roots. We have veriﬁed the effectiveness and robust-
ness of the proposed ZTA by simulating worm-spreading and
zero-day DDoS attacks.
