1 Introduction

DevOps and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) are interconnected with each other. Trivedi [1] proclaimed that DevOps is a
business-driven approach to providing software, and AI is the technology that can be used in the system to enhance its
functionality. So, DevOps teams can use AI to test, code, release, monitor, and improve the system. Through AI, the
automation process delivered by DevOps could be improved efﬁciently. Besides, Battina [2] articulated that AI and
DevOps are interdependent for the better performance of information systems. The author propounded that AI is sig-
niﬁcant for DevOps to perform better organizational functions. However, businesses lose focus on harnessing AI and
DevOps to develop organizational systems better. In addition, Columbus [3] discussed the ten ways AI can accelerate
DevOps. The ten ways include enhancing the productivity of DevOps in real-time, streamlining the requirement man-
agement system, providing an effective bug detection system, prioritizing the security testing and results, improving
software quality, providing adept troubleshooting, removing anomalies that can alter DevOps teams, enhancing supply
chain management, improving traceability, and creating integrated DevOps strategy [4, 5]. Moreover, [3] articulated
that it is paramount to discuss the transformation of DevOps through AI because it can help businesses realize its im-
portance before it becomes late for them. So, the research motivation is to achieve the aim of the study. The study aims
to assess whether AI can transform DevOps. The research can facilitate businesses and software developers to know
the signiﬁcance of AI in DevOps. They can use the study ﬁndings to elaborate on how AI transforms DevOps and how
businesses can adapt it for their success. Hence, AI and DevOps are interconnected and can provide comprehensive
beneﬁts to businesses. The research shed light on discussing how AI can transform DevOps as a primary motivation.

1.1 DevOps: A Brief Overview

DevOps is the ability of an organization to deliver applications and services at high velocity. Chapman [6] articu-
lated that DevOps combines engineering patterns and practices, culture, and tools that can enhance the organizational
capability to deliver services with increased quality. Different practices such as continuous integration, continuous
delivery, monitoring and logging and infrastructure as code have evolved during DevOps adaption. Jha and Khan
[7] propounded that the objectives of DevOps include building up a culture of coordinated efforts, quickening time
to advertise client input, keeping up with quality standards, considering experimentation, mechanizing conventional

operational improvement, and using stages to give turnkey scenarios. Initially, DevOps was considered helpful for
big businesses, but now every business is using DevOps to beneﬁt from automation. In addition, Akshaya et al. [8]
posited that ’Dev’ means all developers involved in the production stage and ’Ops’ means operation team, including
security professionals, administration, system engineers and others. So, DevOps is an activity where developers and
operational bodies collaborate in each DevOps cycle, starting from the development to the production stage. Hence,
DevOps combines engineering, cultural, and IT activities to automate business operations or product delivery. It
involves developers and operations together to enhance the quality of output [9, 10].

1.2 Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI): A Brief Overview

Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence demonstrated by machines rather than humans. Ertel [11] proclaimed
that AI, also known as machine intelligence, demonstrates learning and intelligence in solving problems.
In the
information technology ﬁeld, AI can be considered an intelligent agent who perceives the environment intelligently
and takes actions to maximize the chances of achieving goals. As per the author, AI has entered our daily lives and is
used by big organizations, for example, IBM, Uber, Google, Facebook, and others, to enhance the automated systems,
i.e., DevOps, through innovation and continuous improvement promises. In a similar context, Flasi´nski [12] elucidated
that artiﬁcial intelligence is a logic-based approach. The AI logic represents the knowledge of the world’s agent, its
goals, and situational analysis through logic. It informs the agent about the current scenario that help in effective
decision making. It reduces the human effort in making the decision. Hence, artiﬁcial intelligence is a logic-based
natural computational language that perceives the environment and solves problems with intelligence and learning.
It facilitates monitoring, assessing, and evaluation of systems and provide solution options to agents, which reduces
decision-making time drastically.

2 Literature Review

2.1 How do AI and DevOps work together?

Artiﬁcial intelligence and DevOps are interconnected with each other. Kinsbruner [13] articulated that DevOps is
about accelerating the software development process to deliver value. It enhances the collaboration between operation
and developers to deliver the enhanced quality service to the client. Traditional DevOps only allowed organizations
to implement CD/CI pipelines, but contemporary DevOps, in collaboration with AI, improved the operations and
automated the code reviews. AI/ML automated DevOps’ code reviews and analysis process and lessened the burden
on teams. It facilitates to get earlier detection results of code ﬂaws, security issues, and code-related defects that
can solve in time and enhances the end-user performance results. In a similar context, Matsui et al. [14] and Surya
[15] articulated that AI transforms DevOps by enhancing the application’s quality of development, deployment, and
monitoring. It adds value to the DevOps cycle through automated feedback and reviews. The tasks are completed
in less time, which lessens the delivery time of the application and increases the end-user satisfaction. Additionally,
Ciucu et al.
[16] propounded that AI integrated with TensorFlow (TF), Caffe, Apache, and Microsoft Cognitive
Toolkit in the past few years. Such DevOps deals with environment setup and database management. The integration
of AI enhanced the quality of DevOps processes quality. For example, in a container pipeline, the implication of AI
automates the monitoring of API-Calls, debugging information, and process states. Hence, AI and DevOps can work
together by transforming DevOps processing time and enhancing the quality.

2.2 DevOps and AI as new Standard of Businesses

It has been demonstrated that DevOps and AI can work together to enhance the efﬁciency of businesses. Battina [2]
articulated that AI and DevOps are changing every industry by bringing automation and enhanced problem-solving
solutions. The use of AI in mobile robots increases DevOps and AI to convert manual jobs to automated ones. They
become the new standard of businesses without which it is impossible to succeed in the market [17]. Moreover,
Columbus [3] discussed the ten ways AI can accelerate DevOps to enhance business efﬁciency. The ten ways include
enhancing the productivity of DevOps in real-time, streamlining the requirement management system, providing an
effective bug detection system, prioritizing the security testing and results, improving software quality, providing adept
troubleshooting, can remove anomalies that can alter DevOps teams, enhancing supply chain management, improve
traceability, and create integrated DevOps strategy. Hence, DevOps and AI are the future of businesses. AI is bringing
signiﬁcant changes in DevOps that can help businesses to achieve a competitive advantage in the market.

2.3 Beneﬁts and Challenges

Integrating AI and DevOps can create overwhelming beneﬁts and brings some challenges. The beneﬁts of AI include
facilitating the DevOps team in testing, coding, releasing, and enhancing the quality of programs. It converts the
manual coding and reviewing to an automated system that decreases application delivery time and enhances problem-
solving skills [2]. Additionally, 40% of businesses will use AI and DevOps by 2024 because AI beneﬁts businesses
through transforming DevOps (Gartner). The transformation includes alleviating operational complexities, streamlin-
ing communication, simplifying application monitoring, guiding the approach for effective application development,
fostering resolutions, and improving software testing. However, Hurst [18] articulated that AI can distract the engi-
neering team from end goals, bringing challenges in achieving the results. The narrow task intelligence or weak AI
can provide risks by limiting the decision-making to a narrow set of statistics. So, developers and operational teams
also need to use their understanding in decision-making. Hence, AI can transform DevOps to create overwhelming
beneﬁts for organizations. However, dependency on AI-driven statistics can bring challenges for organizations that
need human-driven intelligence to control during the DevOps cycle of application delivery.

3 Research Methodology

In consequence of the stated objective of the study, the following are the preferred research methods. A qualitative
method is applied for an in-depth and broader analysis of AI transforming DevOps. This method is useful in studies
that demand non-statistical analysis. However, the quantitative method, on the other hand, is not preferred as it largely
relies on using numerical, statistical and computational techniques [19], which do not correlate or are required for
the present study. In relation to the data sources and data collection process, secondary data sources are preferred,
which are easily available and accessible online, including books, articles, journals, websites, etc. However, the use
of primary data sources is not needed in this study as it focuses on retrieving information and data from a group of
people or ﬁrst-hand sources. Moreover, primary sources are lengthy, time-consuming and expensive, and it ﬁts well
usually with the quantitative method in which surveys as a design are used [19]. Therefore, relating to the present
study, secondary sources are signiﬁcant as they are not expensive, neither time-consuming nor difﬁcult to interpret.
Moreover, the information collected through secondary sources can be easily molded to suit the objectives of the
study, while in primary sources, this cannot happen as the researcher have less control over the data/information.
Hence, this secondary source for data collection is suitable to rely on online websites. In order to analyze the collected
data, review-based analysis is considered, which is appropriate for comprehensively reviewing literature related to the
topic and using it to support the key ﬁndings of the study [20]. In relevance to the qualitative method and secondary
sources, review-based analysis is well-match and therefore is signiﬁcant to accomplishing the key research objectives.

4 Results and Discussion

The ﬁndings of this study have focused on AI and DevOps integration, its link with business standards, and beneﬁts
and challenges. It is noted that both AI and DevOps are reliant as DevOps is a business-centric approach for delivering
software, and the technology of AI can be connected to the system to increase functionality. Using AI, it is noted
that DevOps can be tested, coded, released and can efﬁciently monitor software. AI is found useful in improving
automation, addressing issues by identifying them quickly, and improving collaboration [1]. The ﬁndings of Ertel [11]
correlate with the results arguing that AI is capable of solving problems and can be considered as an able instrument
through which timely actions can be taken to increase the prospects of accomplishing key objectives.

Moreover, the results also highlight that AI can have an important role in increasing the efﬁciency of DevOps, as it
can increase performance by allowing quick operation and development of cycles and giving a compelling experience
to customers. There are different ways through which AI can transform and work together with DevOps. Limited
unregulated access to data is identiﬁed to be one of the key challenges encountered by DevOps teams, and therefore in
this reference, integrating with AI can aid in free data from its company silos for data aggregation. In addition, AI is
found to collect data from different sources and categorize it for repeatable and consistent analysis [1]. Likewise, the
study of Kinsbruner [13] somewhat discussed similar that AI automated DevOps’ analysis process facilitates teams
and helps address issues and increase performance.

Similarly, the results showed that Machine learning (ML) models could be helpful in case of failure in areas/tools
in DevOps, which can slow down and weaken the process. ML can support predicting error using data, and AI can
predict signs and read patterns of failure, particularly when a fault is identiﬁed. In addition, AI is useful in seeing
indicators that cannot be perceived by humans, and early notiﬁcation and prediction can help teams to acknowledge
and ﬁx the problem prior to it can affect SDLC (software development life cycle) [1]. Ciucu et al. [16] support that
the integration of AI increases the quality of DevOps processes, and AI and DevOps can be integrated by transforming

3

AI and DevOps

the processing time of DevOps and increasing the quality. ML can enhance the performance of DevOps by reducing
inefﬁciencies in SDLC and automating recurrent tasks. In addition, by using AI, the teams of DevOps can check and
test software more efﬁciently and quickly.

With respect to the standard of business, the results showed that with the inclusion of ML and AI, the organiza-
tion/business could be transformed digitally. The integration of AI and ML with DevOps results in signiﬁcant shifts in
its development, as initially, its sets DevOps as key support for the digital transformation of the business. For the or-
ganizations relying on living data, using ML and AI with DevOps is proven to increase their value greatly in different
aspects, such as from efﬁcient workﬂow to the strengthening of security for the development of applications. Con-
sidering the involvement of ML and AI, the automation and manual conﬁguration of security aspects is ﬁxated upon
reducing the administration misconﬁguration and changes of faults. Improvisation can be made by reducing downtime,
and gaps can be done by assessing risks. Using ML and AI, data can be made efﬁcient, as well as decision-making
and analysis.

A previous study by Battina [2] also highlighted that AI, and DevOps’ collaboration and integration can increase
business efﬁciency, and these can signiﬁcantly affect the industry through automation and increase problem-solving
solutions. It has been found that AI can increase DevOps for enhancing the efﬁciency of the business as well as
its productivity by focusing on streamlining the essentialities of the management system, providing a bug detection
system, and prioritizing the result and security test. Moreover, AI is observed to bring considerable transformation in
DevOps that can support businesses in terms of their efﬁciency and competitiveness.

Regarding the beneﬁts and challenges, the results show that AI is beneﬁcial in DevOps in terms of increasing the
security of software. It does by raising the speed of security tests. Besides, it is observed that software developers are
confused and in a position of indecisiveness when choosing to work on time-consuming and necessary security tests.
However, by using AI, the software developers can easily run security tests and, at the same time, complete their work
on deadlines. This is possible because AI can signiﬁcantly lower the risk vector ID times, raising the efﬁciency of false-
positive identities. Moreover, it has an important role in terms of the management of ill-trained security professionals,
which is now a major problem for organizations.

Moreover, AI can make it done by assisting cybersecurity professionals and creating the demand for different types
of security data professionals that are able to work using AI technologies. The ﬁndings of Battina [2] also agree
that integrating AI can help to transform DevOps by reducing operational complexities, streamlining communication,
improving software testing, simplifying monitoring of applications, fostering resolutions, and alleviating operational
issues. On the contrary, there exist challenges as well, and it is found that a high level of complexity is linked to
monitoring and handling the DevOps environment. Besides, there is a challenge for DevOps teams to manage the
level in the contemporary distributed and dynamic application environment. The DevOps team has to manage data in
Exabyte, and hence it turns out to be complex for people to manage such large data and address customer concerns, as
it is a time-consuming and challenging task. Recent literature by Hurst [18] highlights the same and argues that it can
be challenging for humans to manage data. Moreover, it is noted that relying on AI-driven statistics can be complex
for companies that require human-driven intelligence to control the DevOps cycle of application delivery.

5 Recommendations

The following are the key recommendation in terms of AI transforming DevOps:

It is recommended to rely on AI for efﬁcient application progress as the use of AI with instruments such as Git can give
visibility to deal with irregularities in even resource handling, long build time, and code volume. Moreover, Ops teams
for early detection can take the help of ML and AI as it allows detection of issues through quick mitigation response
enabling business continuity. Moreover, AI can be signiﬁcant in business assessment as well and helpful for ensuring
business continuity for companies and facilitating business development. DevOps teams should use ML for emergency
addressing as it can help assess machine intelligence and has a signiﬁcant role in managing quick alerts by facilitating
the system to point out the anomaly, therefore, aiding in the ﬁltering process of unexpected alerts making it highly
effective. Moreover, ML can be used in the production cycle and is found useful in assessing resource utilization.

Likewise, AI can help transform DevOps through improved data access; therefore, it is recommended that it integrate
AI as it facilitates compiling data from different sources and organizing it simultaneously. Moreover, it can be helpful
in analyzing and providing an overview of trends. Moreover, AI can help in security as well; by using ML and AI,
security threats can not only be identiﬁed but also managed successfully. Besides, AI can be proven effective in terms
of bug detection; therefore, its application is recommended in this reference.

Columbus [3] discussed that bug detection instruments at Facebook predicted faults and recommended solutions that
proved to be 80% correct, with AI instruments adapting to automatically ﬁx the bugs. It is noted that Semmle Code QL

4

AI and DevOps

is found to be a prime AI-centric DevOps instrument, and the Ops team can rely on this tool for tracking risk in code
and identifying logical variants in the codebase. To add further, Microsoft has already used Code QL for identifying
risks and vulnerabilities. Experts of security in the Microsoft team used this instrument to search for variants of major
issues, enabling them to locate and respond to major code issues and avert further occurrences. Moreover, AI needs
to be used by DevOps teams to analyze the success of projects in terms of supply chain management. AI with ML
algorithms can ﬁnd the pattern and acquire insight about the data and, therefore, can signiﬁcantly aid DevOps teams.

6 Conclusion

The study aimed to explore how AI can transform DevOps. The research is useful in terms of facilitating software de-
velopers and businesses to assess the importance of AI in DevOps. The study has practical implications as it elaborates
on how AI transforms DevOps and in what way it can support businesses in their business. A plethora of literature
has been reviewed explaining AI and DevOps, its integration and its beneﬁts and challenges. The research adopted a
qualitative method, secondary data source and review-based analysis. It is noted that DevOps, in collaboration with
AI, is useful in improving operations and automating code reviews. Moreover, the automated code review and analysis
process are likely to reduce the burden on DevOps teams and support them in getting early detection outcomes of code
errors, security problems and code-associated defects.

It is found that AI is important in increasing DevOps efﬁciency through quick operation and development of cycle.
Incorporating both ML and AI with DevOps leads to considerable transformation in its development, and is increases
value and ensures an efﬁcient ﬂow of work. Moreover, AI can help software developers to run security tests and timely
complete work before deadlines. Nevertheless, the challenge related to AI is about managing data in Exabyte, which
is complex for software developers and DevOps to manage, as it is quite a challenging task. Besides, key recommenda-
tions are also offered to businesses and software developers that can help them transform DevOps, including efﬁcient
application, ensuring business continuity, managing quick alerts, improved data access, aid in security, effective in bug
detection, and Code QL.
