ABSTRACT
Magnetic Ô¨Åelds can drastically change predictions of evolutionary models of massive stars via
mass-loss quenching, magnetic braking, and eÔ¨Écient angular momentum transport, which we
aim to quantify in this work. We use the mesa software instrument to compute an extensive
main-sequence grid of stellar structure and evolution models, as well as isochrones, accounting
for the eÔ¨Äects attributed to a surface fossil magnetic Ô¨Åeld. The grid is densely populated in
initial mass (3-60 M(cid:12)), surface equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength (0-50 kG), and metallicity
(representative of the Solar neighbourhood and the Magellanic Clouds). We use two magnetic
braking and two chemical mixing schemes and compare the model predictions for slowly-
rotating, nitrogen-enriched ("Group 2") stars with observations in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
We quantify a range of initial Ô¨Åeld strengths that allow for producing Group 2 stars and Ô¨Ånd
that typical values (up to a few kG) lead to solutions. Between the subgrids, we Ô¨Ånd notable
departures in surface abundances and evolutionary paths. In our magnetic models, chemical
mixing is always less eÔ¨Écient compared to non-magnetic models due to the rapid spin-
down. We identify that quasi-chemically homogeneous main sequence evolution by eÔ¨Écient
mixing could be prevented by fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds. We recommend comparing this grid of
evolutionary models with spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic observations with the goals
of i) revisiting the derived stellar parameters of known magnetic stars, and ii) observationally
constraining the uncertain magnetic braking and chemical mixing schemes.

Magnetism is ubiquitously present in the Universe, from the scale
of sub-atomic particles up to the scale of galaxy clusters (e.g.,

role in regulating star formation as molecular clouds collapse (e.g.,
Commer√ßon et al. 2011; Mackey & Lim 2011; Crutcher 2012; Hen-
nebelle 2013; K√∂rtgen & Soler 2020; Seifried et al. 2020), and in
the formation and physics of neutron stars (e.g., Reisenegger 2009;
Beloborodov 2009; Takiwaki et al. 2009; Takiwaki & Kotake 2011;
M√∂sta et al. 2015; Kuroda et al. 2020; Aloy & Obergaulinger 2021;
Reboul-Salze et al. 2021; Masada et al. 2022). In the phase between
star formation and stellar end products, massive star evolution re-
mains uncertain in part due to the incomplete understanding of
stellar magnetic Ô¨Åelds.

Spectropolarimetric surveys revealed that a subset (about 10%)
of hot ((cid:38) 10 kK), massive (8 - 60 M(cid:12)) and intermediate-mass (2 -
8 M(cid:12)) stars in the Galaxy with spectral types O, B, and A host large-
scale, globally-organised surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds (Morel et al. 2015;
Fossati et al. 2016; Wade et al. 2016; Alecian et al. 2016; Grunhut
et al. 2017; Shultz et al. 2018; Sikora et al. 2019a; Petit et al. 2019).
Surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds are detected both in chemically peculiar
Bp/Ap stars, as well as in O, B, and A stars without observed chem-
ical peculiarities (e.g., Donati & Landstreet 2009; Henrichs et al.
2013; Neiner et al. 2015; Grunhut et al. 2017; Shultz et al. 2018;
Sikora et al. 2019a). In addition, all known Of?p stars (showing vari-
able emission in the Ciii ùúÜ4647-4650-4652 complex, of comparable
strength at its maximum to emission in the Niii ùúÜ4634-4640-4642
complex, Walborn 1972) in the Galaxy are observed to be mag-
netic1. Alongside spectropolarimetric observations, several proper-
ties may be used to identify magnetic candidates from photometric
and spectroscopic studies, including multi-wavelength diagnostics
(e.g., Babel & Montmerle 1997; Cohen et al. 2003; Marcolino et al.
2012; Rivinius et al. 2013; Naz√© et al. 2014; Oksala et al. 2015;
Buysschaert et al. 2018; Walborn et al. 2015; Leto et al. 2021).
Most recently, TESS photometric data is being used to identify can-
didate magnetic stars based on characteristic light-curve variations
and subsequently observe them via spectropolarimetry (David-Uraz
et al. 2019; Sikora et al. 2019b; Shultz et al. 2019c; David-Uraz et al.
2021b; Shultz et al. 2021a).

The observed surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds of hot, massive and
intermediate-mass stars do not show any apparent correlation with
stellar and rotational parameters unlike in lower-mass (<2 M(cid:12)), cool
stars (<10 kK), where magnetism due to surface convection and dif-
ferential rotation ubiquitously produce dynamo activity (Donati &
Landstreet 2009; Neiner et al. 2015). Consequently, the organised,
large-scale magnetic Ô¨Åelds of hot stars are expected to be of fos-
sil origin (Cowling 1945; Spitzer 1958; Mestel 1967, 2003; Moss
2003; Mestel & Moss 2010; Ferrario et al. 2015; Braithwaite &
Spruit 2004, 2017). The exact origin of observed magnetic Ô¨Åelds
remains debated. In about 10% of intermediate-mass Herbig Be/Ae
stars (which 10% is thought to be the precursors of main sequence
Bp/Ap stars), large-scale surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds are already ob-
served on the pre-main sequence (Ste¬∏pie≈Ñ 2000; Alecian et al. 2009,
2013; Villebrun et al. 2019; Lavail et al. 2020), which may be ac-
quired from the star-forming disk or generated via a dynamo action
inside the star during a fully convective pre-main sequence phase
(e.g. Moss 2003; Braithwaite 2012). In addition to magnetic Ô¨Åelds
possibly remaining from the star formation or pre-main sequence
phases, stellar mergers could also amplify seed magnetic Ô¨Åelds to a
strength suÔ¨Écient to be detectable (Ferrario et al. 2009; Wickramas-
inghe et al. 2014; Schneider et al. 2016, 2019, 2020), suggesting that
there may exist multiple channels to generate globally-organised,

2002; Petit et al. 2013, 2017; Grunhut et al. 2017).

large-scale fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds. Merger events of compact rem-
nants have also been proposed to explain strongly magnetised white
dwarfs and neutron stars (e.g., Tout et al. 2008; Giacomazzo et al.
2015; Ferrario et al. 2020; Caiazzo et al. 2021; Shultz et al. 2021b).
The nature of fossil Ô¨Åelds is fundamentally diÔ¨Äerent from con-
temporaneously generated dynamo Ô¨Åelds by a mechanical source
(such as convection or diÔ¨Äerential rotation). Fossil Ô¨Åeld evolution
is purely dissipative with no active Ô¨Åeld generation counteracting
its slow dissipation (Braithwaite & Spruit 2017). In stellar layers
where large-scale fossil Ô¨Åelds spread through, it is expected that
solid-body rotation will develop (e.g. Mestel 1999). In those stellar
layers2 the mechanical source of diÔ¨Äerential rotation is absent, and
consequently small-scale dynamo Ô¨Åelds in radiative stellar layers
cannot be induced (Spruit 2004). The Tayler instability (Tayler 1973;
Goldstein et al. 2019), for example, cannot develop if the radial ro-
tation proÔ¨Åle is completely Ô¨Çat, which means that the Tayler-Spruit
(or "Œ©-type") dynamo cannot be induced in the presence of a fossil
Ô¨Åeld (e.g., Spruit 2004). In fact, while this type of dynamo mecha-
nism in radiative stellar layers was proposed by Spruit (2002), there
remains ongoing debate about the necessary electromotive force
to operate the dynamo cycle (Fuller et al. 2019). The simulations
of Zahn et al. (2007) suggest that this dynamo cycle does not op-
erate. Despite the contradictory numerical results and the lack of
direct observational evidence, dynamos in radiative stellar layers
are commonly accounted for in evolutionary models (e.g., Spruit
2002; Maeder & Meynet 2003, 2004, 2005; Maeder 2009; Heger
et al. 2005; Yoon et al. 2006; Denissenkov & Pinsonneault 2007;
Potter et al. 2012b; Quentin & Tout 2018; Fuller et al. 2019; Fuller
& Ma 2019; Takahashi & Langer 2021). We emphasise that these
implementations are not suitable (at least directly) to model stars
that are known to host fossil Ô¨Åelds.

The time evolution of fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds also remains an
unresolved problem. Observed samples of magnetic A-type stars
and compact remnants are consistent with the magnetic Ô¨Çux being
conserved over time (e.g., Landstreet et al. 2007, 2008; Wickra-
masinghe & Ferrario 2005; Neiner et al. 2017; Martin et al. 2018;
Sikora et al. 2019a), whereas other observational evidence (includ-
ing that for OB stars) suggests magnetic Ô¨Çux decay (e.g., Fossati
et al. 2016; Shultz et al. 2019b). Fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds are expected
to evolve only by Ohmic dissipation (Wright 1969; Spruit 2004;
Duez & Mathis 2010; Braithwaite & Spruit 2017), which has a
longer timescale than the main sequence nuclear timescale (Cowling
1945; Spitzer 1958). However, Ohmic dissipation remains riddled
with uncertainties depending on the exact value of magnetic diÔ¨Äu-
sivity (e.g., Charbonneau & MacGregor 2001) and the geometry of
the magnetic Ô¨Åeld since more complex Ô¨Åelds dissipate faster.

Despite the uncertainties regarding the origin and evolution of
fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds, it is now well established that they lead to
various changes in stellar structure and evolution (e.g., Mestel 1989,
1999; Duez & Mathis 2010; MacDonald & Petit 2019; Jermyn &
Cantiello 2020). Two main surface eÔ¨Äects, mass-loss quenching
and magnetic braking (discussed in detail below), have been shown
to drastically modify evolutionary model predictions (e.g., Meynet
et al. 2011; Keszthelyi et al. 2017a, 2019, 2020, 2021). For instance,
heavy stellar-mass black holes and pair-instability supernovae could

2 However, dynamo-generated Ô¨Åelds and fossil Ô¨Åelds may co-exist in some
stellar layers, for example, at the core-envelope interface (Featherstone et al.
2009). Whether such an interaction could lead to a more rapid dissipation
of the fossil Ô¨Åeld remains an open question.

be formed from magnetic progenitors even at solar metallicity (Petit
et al. 2017; Georgy et al. 2017).

Thus far, surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds have only been detected
in Galactic stars. Currently, high-resolution spectropolarimeters
used for stellar magnetometry are employed on 4m-class tele-
scopes, which limits observations to bright nearby stars. Using low-
resolution spectropolarimetry, Bagnulo et al. (2017, 2020) searched
for strong magnetic Ô¨Åelds in the Magellanic Clouds through the
Zeeman eÔ¨Äect, which did not lead to deÔ¨Ånite detections in any
of the targets. While high-resolution spectropolarimetry remains
largely limited to a Galactic environment, very extensive spectro-
scopic campaigns in the Magellanic Clouds ‚Äì in addition to the
identiÔ¨Åed Of?p stars (e.g., Walborn et al. 2015; Munoz et al. 2020)
‚Äì suggest that the nature of some stars may be explained by invok-
ing surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds (Hunter et al. 2008; Brott et al. 2011a;
Rivero Gonz√°lez et al. 2012; Potter et al. 2012b; Grin et al. 2017;
Dufton et al. 2018, 2020; Ramachandran et al. 2021). Observations
of known magnetic stars in the Galaxy are often compared to evo-
lutionary models that do not include fossil Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects (e.g., those
of Brott et al. 2011a; Ekstr√∂m et al. 2012; ChieÔ¨É & Limongi 2013;
Choi et al. 2016; Costa et al. 2021; Grasha et al. 2021), possibly
making inferences of stellar parameters rather uncertain. In turn,
this can largely impact the derived ages of individual stars and bias
isochrone Ô¨Åtting of stellar clusters. Therefore, there is a need for
stellar evolution models (and model grids), which take into account
mass-loss quenching and magnetic braking (although see Potter
et al. 2012b for the latter), thereby aÔ¨Äecting detailed evolutionary
model predictions and population synthesis studies in both Galactic
and extragalactic environments.

The motivation of this study is to help to resolve these issues
by presenting and studying an extensive grid of stellar structure and
evolution models with metallicities typical of environments in the
Solar neighbourhood3, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that include the eÔ¨Äects of surface fossil
magnetic Ô¨Åelds. The model computations are open source and the
entire library of models is available to the community via Zenodo
at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7069766.

This paper is part of a series in which we aim to explore the
eÔ¨Äects of surface fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds on massive star evolution.
In the Ô¨Årst paper of the series (Keszthelyi et al. 2019, hereafter
Paper I), we used the Geneva stellar evolution code (Eggenberger
et al. 2008; Ekstr√∂m et al. 2012; Georgy et al. 2013; Groh et al.
2019; Murphy et al. 2021) and discussed the mutual impact of mag-
netic mass-loss quenching, magnetic braking, and Ô¨Åeld evolution
on a typical massive star of initially 15 M(cid:12) at solar metallicity.
We studied both solid-body and diÔ¨Äerentially-rotating models and
evaluated their key evolutionary characteristics, showing that strong
surface nitrogen enrichment is expected for magnetic models with
diÔ¨Äerential rotation. In the second paper (Keszthelyi et al. 2020,
hereafter Paper II), we elaborated on the implementation of mas-
sive star magnetic braking in the mesa software instrument (Paxton
et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019) and detailed the magnetic
and rotational evolution of the models by performing a parameter
test in initial mass, magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, and rotational velocity
space with 35 models. Then, 72 tailored models were compared
with a sample of observed magnetic B-type stars from Shultz et al.
(2018, 2019a,b). A key Ô¨Ånding of Paper II is that magnetic stars

billa et al. (2008, 2013), Nieva & Przybilla (2012) and Asplund et al. (2009),
we refer to this set of models as Solar and not Galactic.

our 1D models, instead they are used to constrain the corresponding scal-
ing relations. Colours indicate the logarithmic angular velocity; the rotation
axis is shown with dotted lines. Left: INT scheme, representative of a dipolar
Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration leading to internal magnetic braking, spinning down all
layers of the star. As a phenomenological picture, we assume that convec-
tive expulsion (see Appendix C) would not allow the Ô¨Åeld to relax in the
stellar core; however, we assume that the braking can propagate uniformly
(including the core). The angular rotation is uniform throughout the star,
enforced by a high diÔ¨Äusivity attributed to the dipole Ô¨Åeld. Right: SURF
scheme, representative of a more complex Ô¨Åeld geometry leading to surface
magnetic braking. The magnetic energy can be stored in higher-order spher-
ical harmonics, and twisted Ô¨Åeld lines only penetrate to some extent of the
envelope which we assume to be 20 per cent of the mass fraction. In those
layers eÔ¨Écient angular momentum transport is present but we assume that
core-envelope coupling is not achieved. Magnetic braking is only applied to
those upper layers (see Section 2.6.1). To be able to incorporate the eÔ¨Äects
of such Ô¨Åelds into 1D models, we assume that a quadrupole scaling may be
used for calculating the Alfv√©n radius.

could originate from ZAMS progenitors with a variety of parame-
ter combinations. In Paper III (Keszthelyi et al. 2021) we focused on
the scenario that some magnetic stars may originate from rapidly-
rotating progenitors at the ZAMS, and speciÔ¨Åcally applied it to the
case of the magnetic early B-type star ùúè Sco. We found that for this
star the simultaneous nitrogen enrichment and slow rotation poses
a signiÔ¨Åcant challenge for single-star evolution.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we detail the
assumptions and input physics used in the models. In Section 3,
we present and scrutinise the stellar structure and evolution models
from our computations. In Section 4, we discuss implications and
future work. Finally, we conclude our Ô¨Åndings in Section 5.

2 MODELLING ASSUMPTIONS AND SETUP

2.1 General strategy

In this work, we follow the general strategy of adopting suitable
parametric prescriptions to model the eÔ¨Äects of fossil magnetic
Ô¨Åelds, similar to the approaches presented in Paper I, Paper II,
Paper III and references therein. While one-dimensional magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) approaches are possible, they have mostly
been developed for dynamo models (e.g., Potter et al. 2012b; Fei-
den & Chaboyer 2012, 2013; Quentin & Tout 2018; Takahashi &

4

Z. Keszthelyi et al.

Langer 2021) and as such are not directly applicable to model fossil
Ô¨Åelds of intermediate-mass and massive stars. In particular, mag-
netic transport equations have been developed and used previously
in the context of dynamo-generated Ô¨Åelds (e.g., Spruit 2002; Maeder
& Meynet 2003, 2004, 2005; Heger et al. 2005; Yoon et al. 2006;
Potter et al. 2012b; Kissin & Thompson 2018; Quentin & Tout
2018; Fuller et al. 2019; Fuller & Ma 2019; Takahashi & Langer
2021). Although the characteristics (for example, the scale and time
evolution) of dynamo models are incompatible with those of fossil
Ô¨Åelds (see Section 1), the transport equations may follow similar
implementations. Here, we opt to artiÔ¨Åcially increase the diÔ¨Äusivity
instead of testing "magnetic" transport equations (Section 2.6.2).
Such equations would introduce more free parameters and further
assumptions regarding the geometry, structure, and radial depen-
dence of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld. Clearly, further research and observa-
tional veriÔ¨Åcation is required before an appropriate one-dimensional
magnetic transport process could be reliably incorporated to model
stellar evolution with fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds (however, see Duez &
Mathis 2010; Schneider et al. 2020). Duez & Mathis (2010) and
Duez et al. (2010) presented a comprehensive approach applicable
for fossil Ô¨Åelds, showing however that the impact on hydrodynamic
equilibrium and energy transport are modest even for strong mag-
netic Ô¨Åelds. To this extent, it is indeed appropriate to use parametric
prescriptions and focus on the major, measurable eÔ¨Äects4 that fossil
magnetic Ô¨Åelds have, namely changing the mass loss (Section 2.5)
and rotation (Section 2.6) of the star, aÔ¨Äecting chemical mixing and
angular momentum transport.

One of the major modelling challenges is that the geometry
and alignment of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in the
corresponding physical description. It has been demonstrated that
a seed magnetic Ô¨Åeld can relax into a stable axisymmetric (around
the magnetic axis) conÔ¨Åguration if the magnetic Ô¨Çux is centrally
concentrated, or into a non-axisymmetric (around the magnetic axis)
conÔ¨Åguration otherwise (Braithwaite & Spruit 2004; Braithwaite &
Nordlund 2006; Braithwaite 2008). In both cases, the latitudinal
averaging is inappropriate to model the magnetic Ô¨Åeld in 1D5.

For simplicity, we assume that the Ô¨Åeld is aligned with the ro-
tation axis of the star since appropriate scaling relations for oblique
Ô¨Åelds (tilted with respect to the rotation axis) are still in devel-
opment. However, the obliquity angles inferred from observations
appear to follow a random distribution, which suggests that, apart
from a few possible exceptions, massive stars generally possess
magnetic Ô¨Åelds that are inclined with respect to the rotation axis
(e.g., Khalack et al. 2003; Shultz et al. 2019a; Sikora et al. 2019a).
Recent work from ud-Doula (2020) suggests that oblique rotation
leads to decreasing the eÔ¨Éciency of magnetic braking. This eÔ¨Äect
could be incorporated in our models via a suitable scaling factor in
future studies. However, the eÔ¨Éciency of magnetic braking, in the
evolutionary context, is also largely dependent on magnetic Ô¨Åeld
evolution, which still needs to be better constrained (e.g., Paper III).

4 See e.g., Driessen et al. (2019a) for mass-loss quenching, and e.g.
Townsend et al. (2010); Oksala et al. (2012); Song et al. (2021) for magnetic
braking.
5 For example, in the case of an axisymmetric dipole geometry, both
poloidal and toroidal components must exist in the stellar interior (Braith-
waite & Spruit 2004). The poloidal Ô¨Åeld strength and orientation relative
to the normal to the surface varies over latitudes. The toroidal Ô¨Åeld, con-
Ô¨Åned by closed poloidal lines, has zero strength along the polar rotation axis
and reaches its maximum along the equatorial plane (see, e.g., Figure 4 of
Braithwaite 2008). A latitudinal averaging instead assigns a mean value to
the poloidal and toroidal Ô¨Åeld components along a radius.

In fact, magnetic Ô¨Åeld evolution is closely tied to the question
of the Ô¨Åeld geometry and, in this regard, new insights are gained
from extensive monitoring campaigns, which can reveal the surface
properties of magnetic Ô¨Åelds. Although a purely dipolar Ô¨Åeld ge-
ometry generally matches observations (Grunhut et al. 2017; Shultz
et al. 2018), modest deviations from pure dipolar geometries are
now identiÔ¨Åed (Leto et al. 2018; Das et al. 2020; David-Uraz et al.
2021a). In other cases, contributions from higher-order harmonics
are also identiÔ¨Åed (e.g., Shultz et al. 2018; Kochukhov et al. 2019);
however, the dipole is the strongest component, which consequently
drives the main physical eÔ¨Äects. In a few cases, observations have
also identiÔ¨Åed stars with uniquely complex magnetic Ô¨Åelds, which
cannot be described with a dominant dipole component (e.g., ùúè Sco,
Donati et al. 2006; Kochukhov & Wade 2016; Shultz et al. 2018).
In these cases, most of the magnetic energy is stored in higher-order
spherical harmonics, although a weak dipole contribution may still
be present.

Since the structure of large-scale magnetic Ô¨Åelds in stellar
interiors is still considerably uncertain, we aim to test two limiting
cases - illustrated in Figure 1 - to apply depth-dependent magnetic
braking (c.f. Paper II). In the models with internal magnetic braking
(INT, described in detail below), we assume that the magnetic Ô¨Åeld is
dipolar. We further assume that the Ô¨Åeld is present in the entire stellar
envelope and is able to achieve core-envelope coupling (however,
only as a phenomenological picture, we assume that it is excluded
from the stellar core). In nature, the stellar envelope must also have
a closed toroidal Ô¨Åeld for a stable conÔ¨Åguration (Wright 1969, 1973;
Braithwaite & Spruit 2004; Braithwaite & Nordlund 2006; Akg√ºn
et al. 2013), which we cannot directly take into account in our 1D
models. The magnetic Ô¨Åeld is curl-free above the stellar surface;
any toroidal Ô¨Åeld diÔ¨Äuses to a poloidal structure. We also introduce
a set of models with surface magnetic braking (SURF, see also
below) as a limiting scenario to contrast the INT models with. The
complex magnetic Ô¨Åeld geometries clearly cannot be translated to
our 1D models, therefore we make various simplifying assumptions
(discussed in detail throughout Section 2). We reiterate that the Ô¨Åeld
geometry cannot be directly included in our models, only via the
scaling relations. The limitations related to the 1D parametrisation
can likely only be resolved once 2D stellar evolution modelling
becomes feasible (Espinosa Lara & Rieutord 2011; Lovekin 2020;
Reese et al. 2021).

Angular momentum is always lost from the outermost layers of
the star. We use the INT/SURF schemes to control the propagation
of this loss to the stellar interiors along with eÔ¨Écient angular mo-
mentum transport. In the INT models, all stellar layers eÔ¨Éciently
transport and lose speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum. Motivated by the
simulations of Braithwaite (2008), we assume that in the SURF
models the magnetic-Ô¨Åeld driven angular momentum transport and
rotational braking only aÔ¨Äect the upper 20% of stellar mass. Al-
though even for complex surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds there may be weak
dipole contributions, we neglect here any possible magnetic angu-
lar momentum transport in the deep stellar interiors so that we are
able to test a limiting case in which radial diÔ¨Äerential rotation may
develop in regions of the star where the magnetic Ô¨Çux is assumed
to be negligible. Furthermore, to generalise from the range of pos-
sible Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Ågurations deduced from observations, we assume
that at least the Alfv√©n radius (see section 2.4) has to be smaller in
the SURF models than in the INT models for a given surface Ô¨Åeld
strength. For this reason, we use a quadrupole scaling in the SURF
models to obtain the Alfv√©n radius. This results in less eÔ¨Écient
magnetic braking for complex Ô¨Åelds compared to dipole-dominated
geometries. The Ô¨Åeld geometry deÔ¨Ånes the wind Ô¨Çow and mass Ô¨Çux

from the stellar surface. We evaluate in Appendix B how an ac-
tual quadrupole Ô¨Åeld geometry would aÔ¨Äect mass-loss quenching;
however, since this eÔ¨Äect only concerns the highest-mass models,
for simplicity we adopt a formalism where only the Alfv√©n radius
is changed in the SURF models compared to the INT models (see
Section 2.5).

We consider one initial rotation rate9 in all models by relaxing
an initial ratio of Œ©/Œ©crit = 0.5. In our models with solar metallic-
ity, this approximately corresponds to an initial equatorial surface
rotational velocity (surf_avg_vrot in mesa) of 300 to 370 km s‚àí1
in the initial stellar mass range from 3 to 60 M(cid:12). The critical angular
velocity is adopted as deÔ¨Åned in mesa star_utils.f90:

2.2 General model setup

We use the software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics mesa release 15140 (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015,
2018, 2019) and Software Development Kit (SDK) version 20.12.1
(Townsend 2020), and carry out our computations on the Dutch
supercomputers Cartesius6 and Snellius7. In this study, we con-
sider main sequence models with initial masses from 3 to 60 M(cid:12)
(Table 1). This choice is made since there are still considerable un-
certainties in stellar evolution, as well as in magnetic Ô¨Åeld evolution
on the post-main sequence. The computations begin by relaxing the
initial model and we consider the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS)
to begin at the time when the initial abundance of core hydrogen
has decreased by 0.3 percent. The endpoint of the models is the
Terminal Age Main Sequence (TAMS), which we consider at the
time when the core hydrogen mass fraction drops below 10‚àí5.

The mesa microphysics are summarised in Appendix A. To cal-
culate the nuclear reaction rates, we use mesa‚Äôs default "basic.net"
option. To model convective mixing, we assume a mixing length
parameter of ùõºMLT = 1.8 (e.g., Canuto & Mazzitelli 1992; Canuto
et al. 1996) and the Henyey formalism (Henyey et al. 1965) in mesa.
Common values of ùõºMLT range from 1.5 to 2.0, mostly based on
solar and solar-type star calibrations (e.g., Bonaca et al. 2012). For
simplicity, we assume the same value in all models, although some
studies predict mass dependence (e.g., Yƒ±ldƒ±z et al. 2006). Semicon-
vective and thermohaline mixing are not used8. Convective bound-
aries are determined via the Ledoux criterion. Core overshooting is
applied in the exponential scheme with parameters ùëìov = 0.015 and
ùëì0 = 0.005, which roughly corresponds to a step overshoot param-
eter ùõºov of 10 percent of the local pressure scale height (Ekstr√∂m
et al. 2012, see further discussion in Appendix C). ùõºov may be mass
dependent (Castro et al. 2014). Commonly used values of ùõºov range
from 0.1 to 0.335, (Schaller et al. 1992; Brott et al. 2011a). Expo-
nential overshooting at non-burning convective regions is adopted
with ùëìov = 0.0010 and ùëì0 = 0.0005. mesa‚Äôs MLT++ scheme is not
applied (see e.g., Poniatowski et al. 2021).

We employ high spatial and temporal resolution by setting
mesh_delta_coeff = 1. and time_delta_coeff = 1., in ad-
dition to setting varcontrol_target = 1.d-4. This results in an
average of 2000-3000 zones for our stellar structure models, and the
evolutionary models consist of a hundred to a few thousand structure
models (each corresponding to one time step), mostly depending on
the initial mass.

8 Neither of these mixing mechanisms is expected to signiÔ¨Åcantly change
main sequence models. It was shown by Charbonnel & Zahn (2007) that a
strong magnetic Ô¨Åeld could inhibit thermohaline mixing in descendants of
Ap stars (see also, e.g., Denissenkov et al. 2009). On the other hand, Har-
rington & Garaud (2019) Ô¨Ånds that thermohaline mixing could be enhanced
by an aligned magnetic Ô¨Åeld.

where the Eddington parameter is Œì = ùêørad/ùêøEdd, G is the grav-
itational constant, and ùëö and ùëü are the mass and radius taken at
the photosphere. This deÔ¨Ånition only plays a role in setting the ini-
tial rotational velocity10. The initial model relaxes from solid-body
rotation to a new conÔ¨Åguration constrained by angular momentum
distribution and transport.

In Paper II we found that a lower rotation rate (initially
Œ©/Œ©crit = 0.2) leads to smaller diÔ¨Äerences between models with
and without magnetic Ô¨Åelds. This is simply because magnetic brak-
ing is less eÔ¨Écient when the rotation is slow11. In Paper II, we
showed that at least a few magnetic stars were best matched with
models that had an initial rotation rate of Œ©/Œ©crit = 0.8. If the initial
rotation rate was higher than considered in this study, it would i)
alter the early evolution of the models on the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram (HRD, as shown in Figure 3 of Paper II), and ii) impact
the quantitative predictions regarding the surface chemical enrich-
ment. It is worth noting that the most rapidly rotating (presumably
young) magnetic stars have present-day surface rotational velocities
of about 300 km s‚àí1, which is close to 50% of the critical rota-
tion deÔ¨Åned in our Equation 1 (e.g., Oksala et al. 2010; Grunhut
et al. 2012; Shultz et al. 2019b; Song et al. 2021). Nevertheless it
remains unknown what initial rotation rates could characterise the
entire sample of magnetic massive stars.

Finally, given the supporting observational evidence by some

9 The actual initial rotation rate of stars in general remains an open question.
Spectroscopic studies have focused on large samples to obtain the distribu-
tion of projected rotational velocities in the Galaxy (Howarth et al. 1997;
Huang et al. 2010; Sim√≥n-D√≠az & Herrero 2014; Simon-Diaz et al. 2016;
Sim√≥n-D√≠az et al. 2017; Holgado et al. 2022) and in the Magellanic Clouds
(Martayan et al. 2006, 2007; Ram√≠rez-Agudelo et al. 2013, 2015; Dufton
et al. 2019, 2020). The Ô¨Åndings indicate a Gaussian distribution of ùë£ sin ùëñ,
with diÔ¨Äerent peak values depending on physical (spectral type, mass, etc.)
and observational characteristics (sample size, magnitude limit, etc.). The
typical peaks of the distributions are around 100 km s‚àí1. Considering that
this value needs to be corrected for the (usually unknown) inclination angles
and that it reÔ¨Çects on the current rotation after a given star or population have
evolved away from the ZAMS, it is generally assumed that the canonical
initial rotational velocities of massive stars are of the order of 300 km s‚àí1.
Although for Galactic O-stars the IACOB survey (Sim√≥n-D√≠az & Herrero
2014; Simon-Diaz et al. 2016; Sim√≥n-D√≠az et al. 2017; Holgado et al. 2022)
has shown somewhat lower values than previous studies (‚âà 100-200 km s‚àí1),
which could be consistent with lower initial rotational velocities. Our cho-
sen input parameter for the initial rotation rate of Œ©/Œ©crit = 0.5 reÔ¨Çects
closely on the canonical value around 300 km s‚àí1, identiÔ¨Åed in the sample
of Howarth et al. (1997).
10 In fact, in mesa the Eddington luminosity is calculated from the total
opacity. Since the precise deÔ¨Ånition of Œ©crit is signiÔ¨Åcantly more complex
(see Puls et al. 2008 for further discussion), we stress here that Œ©crit is only
used as an input option to set the rotational velocity.
11 In Paper I, we also demonstrated that for a typical non-rotating 15 M(cid:12)
model at solar metallicity, mass-loss quenching is modest. As shown by Petit
et al. (2017), who computed non-rotating solar metallicity models between
40 and 80 M(cid:12), the evolutionary impact of magnetic mass-loss quenching
becomes signiÔ¨Åcant at higher masses.

2005; Neiner et al. 2017; Martin et al. 2018; Sikora et al. 2019a),
we assume magnetic Ô¨Çux conservation (Alfv√©n‚Äôs theorem, Alfv√©n
1942) such that the surface magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is obtained from:

ùêµeq = ùêµeq,ini

(cid:19)2

(cid:18) ùëÖ‚òÖ,ini
ùëÖ‚òÖ

(2)

with ùêµeq,ini being the initial surface equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strength (which is assumed in the models at the ZAMS), while
ùëÖ‚òÖ,ini and ùëÖ‚òÖ are the initial and current stellar radii. For further dis-
cussions on magnetic Ô¨Åeld evolution, we refer the reader to Paper I,
Paper II, Paper III and references therein. We adopt a large range of
initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths (from 0 to 50 kG; Donati
& Landstreet e.g., 2009; Shultz et al. e.g., 2019b.)

The run_star_extras Ô¨Åle (available as part of a full re-
production package on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/
zenodo.7069766) is used to modify the wind, torque, angular mo-
mentum transport, and chemical element transport routines. The
parameters varied in the models are summarised in Tables 1, 2, and
3, and are discussed below.

2.3 Metallicity

We compute models for 3 diÔ¨Äerent metallicities (the key elements
are summarised in Table 2 ‚Äì the full list of abundances is available
via the model Ô¨Åles shared on Zenodo) that are representative of the
Solar neighbourhood, LMC, and SMC. For the Solar composition,
we assume the hydrogen and helium mass fractions along with a
metallicity of ùëç = 0.014 (Asplund et al. 2009). The metal fractions
are adopted following the works of Przybilla et al. (2008, 2013) and
Nieva & Przybilla (2012), which updated some elements compared
to the Asplund et al. (2005, 2009) abundances, considering B-type
stars in the solar neighbourhood. The baseline values for the Magel-
lanic Clouds are still subject to ongoing investigations (e.g., Dufton
et al. 2020; Bouret et al. 2021). For the helium and metal abundances
in the LMC and SMC, we adopt the mean values listed in Tables
5 and 6 of Dopita et al. (2019). These mean values are a result of
9 separate investigations using diÔ¨Äerent approaches, which include
atmospheric determinations of hot stars, supernova remnants, and
H ii regions. In all 3 metallicities, we use the Lodders (2003) iso-
topic ratios. The metallicity adopted for the chemical composition
is fully consistent with the metallicity used for the opacity tables.

2.4 Alfv√©n radius

The Alfv√©n radius characterises a critical distance at which the
magnetic energy density and the gas kinetic energy density are
equal. Alternatively, it can also be cast as the inverse square of
the Alfv√©nic Mach number. Its deÔ¨Ånition plays an important role
in both mass-loss quenching (Equations 7-8) and magnetic braking
(Equations 9-10). For a dipolar Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration, ud-Doula et al.
(2009) use a numerical Ô¨Åtting for a quartic equation to obtain:

ùëÖA
ùëÖ‚òÖ

‚âà 1 + (ùúÇ‚òÖ + 0.25)1/4 ‚àí (0.25)1/4 ,

(3)

with ùúÇ‚òÖ the equatorial magnetic conÔ¨Ånement parameter, deÔ¨Åned as:

with ùêµeq the equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, (cid:164)ùëÄùêµ=0 the mass-loss
rate in absence of a magnetic Ô¨Åeld, and ùë£‚àû the terminal velocity12
(ud-Doula et al. 2009). Observations typically reconstruct a polar
Ô¨Åeld strength ùêµp from the line-of-sight disc-integrated (so called
longitudinal) magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength (Donati & Landstreet 2009).
The equatorial Ô¨Åeld strength is exactly one half of the polar Ô¨Åeld
strength. We use Equation 3 to obtain the Alfv√©n radius in the INT
models, which we assume to be characterised by a predominantly
dipolar Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration (Figure 1). In the SURF models we as-
sume the Ô¨Åeld to be more complex, in which case the deÔ¨Ånition of
the Alfv√©n radius is non trivial. For the sake of simplicity we assume
that the Alfv√©n radius takes the form of a scaling appropriate for a
quadrupole Ô¨Åeld geometry, such that:

‚âà 1 + (ùúÇ‚òÖ + 0.25)1/6 ‚àí (0.25)1/6 ,

ùëÖA
ùëÖ‚òÖ
following the parametrisation in Equation 9 of ud-Doula et al.
(2008). This ensures that for a given Ô¨Åeld strength ùëÖA is less in
the SURF case than in the INT case, leading to less eÔ¨Écient mag-
netic braking.

2.5 Stellar winds

2.5.1 Mass-loss schemes and terminal velocities

The models include mass loss. Even though this is modest for the
lower-mass stars (and the driving mechanism is not unambiguously
identiÔ¨Åed as for more massive stars), it can impact their rotational
evolution given the longer nuclear timescale. For this reason, we
apply commonly used mass-loss rates of hot massive stars also
to lower mass main sequence stars in our grid. While the higher-
mass stars typically reach the TAMS at ùëáeÔ¨Ä > 20 kK, we describe
here the detailed treatment implemented in our mesa extension for
completeness and to aid further studies focusing on complementing
this work with post-main sequence models. For massive stars with
ùëáeÔ¨Ä > 10 kK, the mass loss is powered by radiative line driving
(e.g., Lucy & Solomon 1970; Castor et al. 1975; Puls et al. 2008).
In this regime, we apply the rates derived by Vink et al. (2000,
2001), decreased by a factor of 2 for all models in the 3 - 60 M(cid:12)
range for consistency. The choice to reduce the nominal mass-loss
rates is motivated by the growing evidence both from observations,
suggesting that mass-loss rates are lower when accounting for wind
clumping (e.g., Bouret et al. 2005; Fullerton et al. 2006; Trundle
& Lennon 2005; de Almeida et al. 2019; Brands et al. 2022), and
from new modelling approaches (e.g., Muƒ≥res et al. 2012; Krtiƒçka
2014; Krtiƒçka & Kub√°t 2017; Krtiƒçka et al. 2021; Sundqvist et al.
2019; Bj√∂rklund et al. 2021). When using these rates, we apply
(cid:164)ùëÄ ‚àº ùëç 0.85 (e.g.,
metallicity-dependent winds with a scaling of
Vink et al. 2001; Mokiem et al. 2007).

Similarly to Keszthelyi et al. (2017b) and Paper II, we im-
plement the partitioning in eÔ¨Äective temperature related to the bi-
stability jump at 20 kK in agreement with observational and new
theoretical works (Prinja et al. 1990; Prinja & Massa 1998; Lamers
et al. 1995; Petrov et al. 2016), rather than adopting it at 25-27 kK
as in evolutionary models of e.g., Brott et al. (2011a), Ekstr√∂m et al.
(2012), and Choi et al. (2016). This is further supported by mea-
surements of projected rotational velocities that suggest a lack of
bi-stability braking (Crowther et al. 2006; Vink et al. 2010; Keszthe-
lyi et al. 2017b; Gagnier et al. 2019a,b; Krtiƒçka et al. 2021; Vink &
Sander 2021) at least until about 20 kK (Howarth et al. 1997; Huang

et al. 2010). Although we adopt an increase in mass-loss rates at
the bi-stability jump, we note that this prediction still lacks empir-
ical evidence in typical B-type supergiants (Crowther et al. 2006;
Markova & Puls 2008; Rubio-D√≠ez et al. 2022) and is challenged by
new numerical simulations (Sundqvist et al. 2019; Driessen et al.
2019b; Bj√∂rklund et al. 2021).

Below approximately 10 kK the nature of wind-driving re-
mains poorly understood. We opt to use the rates of van Loon et al.
(2005) for all models in this domain, which only concerns a few
lower-mass models in the present grid. New modelling approaches
have conÔ¨Årmed that the second bi-stability jump due to Fe iii re-
combining to Fe ii is expected at ùëáeÔ¨Ä ‚àº 9 kK (Petrov et al. 2016)
in contrast with earlier indications of ‚àº 12.5 kK (Vink et al. 1999,
2000), and implementations in evolutionary models of ‚àº 17-15 kK
(Ekstr√∂m et al. 2012; Brott et al. 2011a). Therefore we avoid the
use of the second bi-stability jump that is typically included in other
grids of models (for further details see, e.g., Figure 3 of Keszthelyi
et al. 2017b). If the eÔ¨Äective temperature is higher than 10 kK and
the surface hydrogen mass fraction becomes less than 0.4, we ap-
ply the Wolf-Rayet rates of Nugis & Lamers (2002). This concerns
some of our most massive models with eÔ¨Écient mixing.

In agreement with the partitionings in eÔ¨Äective temperature,

we estimate the terminal wind velocity ùë£‚àû via:

ùë£‚àû = ùëì‚àû ¬∑ ùë£esc = ùëì‚àû

‚àöÔ∏Ç 2ùê∫ ùëÄ‚òÖ
ùëÖ‚òÖ

(1 ‚àí Œìùëí) ,

(6)

where ùê∫, ùëÄ‚òÖ, ùëÖ‚òÖ, and Œìùëí are respectively the gravitational constant,
the stellar mass, the stellar radius, and the Eddington parameter for
pure electron scattering. The terminal wind velocity is obtained
from the escape velocity as a simple step function by adopting
ùëì‚àû = 2.6, 1.3, 0.7 at ùëáeÔ¨Ä > 20 kK, 20 kK > ùëáeÔ¨Ä > 10 kK, and
ùëáeÔ¨Ä < 10 kK, respectively (Lamers et al. 1995; Vink et al. 2000;
Kudritzki & Puls 2000). The typical terminal velocities at the ZAMS
range from 800 to 3000 km s‚àí1 for models with initial masses from
3 to 60 M(cid:12), respectively. We calculate the rotational enhancement
on the mass-loss rates13 as described by Maeder & Meynet (2000).
This requires deÔ¨Åning the diÔ¨Äerence of the force multiplier param-
eters ùõº(cid:48) (= ùõº ‚àí ùõø, that is, the exponent related to the line-strength
distribution function minus the exponent quantifying the change in
ionisation balance), which we adopt as a simple step function with
values of 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, corresponding to the above-mentioned ef-
fective temperature ranges (see Pauldrach et al. 1986; Lamers et al.
1995; Puls et al. 2000). The alternative calculation of rotational
enhancement built into mesa is not used (see Paper II Section 3.9
for details).

2.5.2 Magnetic mass-loss quenching

The overall Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration that extends into the wind outÔ¨Çow
is governed by the competition between the kinetic energy of the
wind and the magnetic energy of the Ô¨Åeld. The ionised stellar wind
material is forced to Ô¨Çow along magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines. However, as
the wind kinetic energy density has a shallower decline than the
magnetic energy density, the Ô¨Åeld loops can only conÔ¨Åne wind
material up to a certain radius. Within closed Ô¨Åeld loops, material
becomes trapped and eventually falls back onto the surface (unless
centrifugally supported). To account for the global, time-averaged
eÔ¨Äect of the magnetosphere, the mass-loss rates are systematically
reduced. Following the works of ud-Doula et al. (2008, 2009), the
mass-loss quenching parameter ùëìB is deÔ¨Åned as:

stellar surface to the last closed magnetic loop, is approximated as

further scaled by the rotational enhancement ùëìrot (speciÔ¨Åed in Sec-

from (cid:164)ùëÄeÔ¨Ä = ùëìB ¬∑ ùëìrot ¬∑ (cid:164)ùëÄùêµ=0. The magnetic mass-loss quenching pa-
rameter (equivalent to the escaping wind fraction14) can take values
between 0 and 1, depending on the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength. A strong
magnetic Ô¨Åeld (with a strength of tens of kG) may lead to only a
few percent of the wind material actually escaping the star (Petit
et al. 2017; Georgy et al. 2017, Paper I). Let us also note that the
conditions in the above equations are equivalent to distinguishing
between dynamical magnetospheres (if ùëÖA < ùëÖK) and centrifugal
magnetospheres (if ùëÖK < ùëÖA), a classiÔ¨Åcation introduced by Petit
et al. (2013).

The use of Equation 8 is a reÔ¨Ånement compared to previous
implementations. For situations when the Alfv√©n radius is larger
than the Kepler co-rotation radius (centrifugal magnetospheres),
the magnetosphere is expected to be less eÔ¨Écient at quenching
wind mass-loss compared to dynamical magnetospheres (ud-Doula

et al. 2008, 2009). This is because material injected by the wind
into the centrifugal magnetosphere is not returned to the stellar
surface by gravity, but is instead ejected away from the star once the
critical centrifugal breakout density is exceeded (Shultz et al. 2020;
Owocki et al. 2020). This can lead to substantially larger values
of ùëìB for a rotating as compared to a non-rotating star, however
in practice rapid spin-down means that centrifugal magnetospheres
are relatively short-lived and the incorporation of this modiÔ¨Åcation
to the mass-quenching prescription does not have a strong eÔ¨Äect
on evolution. It is generally expected that the evolution proceeds
from centrifugal to dynamical magnetospheres (Shultz et al. 2019b,
Paper I, Paper II).

In this approach, the magnetic mass-loss quenching parameter
is an average quantity. MHD simulations of non-rotating magne-
tospheres predict up- and down-Ô¨Çows of material varying on short
dynamical timescales (ud-Doula & Owocki 2002), which can man-
ifest as stochastic variability in magnetospheric emission lines (ud-
Doula et al. 2013), however time-averaged models provide a good
reproduction of emission line properties (e.g. Sundqvist et al. 2012;
Owocki et al. 2016; Erba et al. 2021) and these short-term, stochastic
variations can therefore be conÔ¨Ådently neglected over evolutionary
timescales. In the case of rapid rotators, 2D MHD simulations led to
the expectation that breakout events would be similarly stochastic,
leading to emptying of the centrifugal magnetosphere and large-
scale magnetospheric reorganisation (ud-Doula et al. 2006, 2008).
However, no indication of large-scale changes has been observed
(Townsend et al. 2013; Shultz et al. 2020), leading Shultz et al.
(2020) and Owocki et al. (2020) to infer that breakout events are
characterised by small spatial scales and occur more or less continu-
ously, such that the centrifugal magnetosphere is maintained nearly
continuously at the breakout density. As a result, it is therefore
appropriate to treat magnetospheric mass-drainage via breakout as
an eÔ¨Äectively continuous process over evolutionary timescales and
apply Equations 7 and 8.

2.6 Angular momentum transport and loss

Magnetic Ô¨Åelds are much more eÔ¨Écient at transporting angular
momentum than purely hydrodynamic processes such as meridional
currents and shear instabilities (e.g., Mestel 1999; Spruit 1999,
2002; Kulsrud 2005; Braithwaite & Spruit 2017). The rotation of
the star leads to Maxwell stresses, which result in losing angular
momentum from the star.

In Paper I, genec models were used, where magnetic braking
is adopted as a boundary condition to internal angular momentum
transport, directly aÔ¨Äecting the uppermost layer of the stellar mod-
els. In Paper II, two kinds of models were introduced to account
for the uncertainty regarding how deeply fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds are
anchored in massive stars. In the INT models, magnetic braking was
applied to the entire star, decreasing uniformly the speciÔ¨Åc angular
momentum in all layers. In the SURF models, magnetic braking was
set to remove speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum from a very near-surface
reservoir. In Paper III, genec models were contrasted with a mesa
implementation where magnetic braking was applied to most of the
stellar envelope. In genec, two conÔ¨Ågurations were used to model

internal angular momentum transport: one with only hydrodynamic
instabilities correctly accounted for via an advecto-diÔ¨Äusive equa-
tion (allowing for shears to develop in deeper layers), and one with
a purely diÔ¨Äusive equation, in which solid-body rotation was estab-
lished. In mesa, we relied on the nominal hydrodynamic transport
processes since they are used in a purely diÔ¨Äusive assumption, lead-
ing to nearly solid-body rotation on the magnetic braking timescale.
Here, we make some further reÔ¨Ånements and adjustments compared
to these approaches, particularly accounting (indirectly) for the Ô¨Åeld
geometry as depicted in Figure 1.

2.6.1 Magnetic braking

Stellar rotation bends and twists magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines in the azimuthal
direction. Magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines can transport and store angular mo-
mentum, and the associated Maxwell stresses are very eÔ¨Écient at
transferring angular momentum to the surrounding plasma. Once
the angular momentum is imparted from the Ô¨Åeld to the gas, the
wind material carries it away, leading to a spin-down of the star.
This process is commonly referred to as (wind) magnetic braking.
In a pioneering series of works, analytical and numerical MHD
simulations were developed, conÔ¨Årming that the Weber & Davis
(1967) model (see also, Parker 1958; Mestel 1968) leads to an
appropriate scaling relation also for massive stars (ud-Doula &
Owocki 2002; ud-Doula et al. 2008, 2009; Owocki & ud-Doula
2004; Townsend & Owocki 2005). Following the work of ud-Doula
et al. (2009), the total ‚Äì wind and magnetic Ô¨Åeld induced ‚Äì loss of
angular momentum can be expressed via:

=

(cid:164)ùëÄùêµ=0 Œ©‚òÖùëÖ2
ùê¥ ,

dùêΩB
dùë°
with dùêΩB/dùë° the rate of angular momentum loss from the system,
Œ©‚òÖ the surface angular velocity, and ùëÖ ùê¥ the Alfv√©n radius (de-
Ô¨Åned in Equations 3 and 5). As this equation accounts for the gas
and Ô¨Åeld driven angular momentum loss (ud-Doula et al. 2009),
it yields the angular momentum loss resulting purely from mass
loss when ùêµsurf = 0. As speciÔ¨Åed in Paper II, we have adjusted the
angular momentum lost via mass loss to avoid double counting. In
Equation 9, the numerical term 2/3 arises from integrating over lati-
tudes. We note that this equation is not applicable when the eÔ¨Äective
mass-loss rate, as introduced above, is exactly zero (this situation
does not happen in our models). In the strong conÔ¨Ånement limit,
when ùëìB ‚Üí 0, the eÔ¨Äective mass-loss rate can become very small.
In this case, a strong magnetic braking can still be achieved since
the Maxwell stresses driving the angular momentum transport are
independent of the plasma Ô¨Çow. As long as there is wind material
at a radial distance larger than the last closed magnetic Ô¨Åeld line,
i.e., the star is not surrounded by vacuum, the Ô¨Åeld can impart an-
gular momentum to the plasma. In Paper II and Paper III, Equation
9 was implemented into mesa via changing the speciÔ¨Åc angular
momentum in given layers of the star, such that a summation over
mass yields the total rate of angular momentum loss as deÔ¨Åned in
Equation 9. It is coded as:

layers in the stellar envelope (SURF; see Figure 1 and discussion be-
low), ùëó is the speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum of a layer (called "j_rot"
in mesa), dùë° is one timestep in the computation15, ùëò is an index
running through all layers, and ùë• is the index of the last layer where
magnetic braking is applied. Therefore, Equation 10 indicates how
to distribute the total angular momentum lost per unit time (dùêΩB/dùë°
given by Equation 9) in given stellar layers. Taking the sum of the
speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum lost per unit time d ùëóB/dùë° with respect
to mass, we recover the left-hand side term.

To distribute the total angular momentum lost per unit time, the
summation goes over the layers of the entire star in the INT case (ùë• ‚âà
3000 zones), whereas in the SURF case it goes from the photosphere
to a lower boundary. This boundary is always in the radiative stellar
envelope of our models. However, more massive models have larger
convective cores, and thus for very massive stars (> 60 M(cid:12)), this
condition may need to be revised as we do not expect the fossil
Ô¨Åeld to be able to penetrate into the convective core. In the SURF
models, ùë• ‚âà 200 zones undergo magnetic braking. Here, we chose
the boundary layer where ùëû = ùëö/ùëÄ‚òÖ = 0.8 (the enclosed mass
is 80% of the total mass) since Braithwaite (2008) demonstrated
that complex, non-axisymmetric Ô¨Åelds (around the magnetic axis)
can form if the magnetic Ô¨Çux is initially not centrally concentrated,
leading to a stable magnetic Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration in which twisted
magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines spread throughout the stellar surface layers.
In the simulations of Braithwaite (2008), a strong toroidal Ô¨Åeld
(enclosed by poloidal Ô¨Åeld lines) is present in approximately 20%
of the upper mass fraction and this motivates our choice for this
parameter.

2.6.2 Angular momentum transport

The main impact of the angular momentum transport equation in
stellar interiors is to change the angular velocity proÔ¨Åle Œ©(ùëü), which
is also measurable via modern asteroseismology (see, e.g., Aerts
et al. 2019 for a comprehensive review). In mesa, angular momen-
tum transport is modelled in a fully diÔ¨Äusive scheme. Note that this
approach inadequately models the meridional currents16, which are
an advective process by nature. mesa solves the angular momentum
transport equation following Equation 46 of Heger et al. (2000),
which is based on the works by Endal & SoÔ¨Åa (1978) and Pinson-
neault et al. (1989), that is:

(11)

where ùê∑AM is the total diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient responsible for angular
momentum transport, while ùëü, ùúå, and ùëö are the radius, density, and
enclosed mass, respectively, and ùë° is the time.

In the non-magnetic models, we assume that ùê∑AM is con-
structed as a sum of four diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients (resulting from dy-
namical and secular shear, meridional circulation, and GSF insta-
bility), which are the same as used for the Mix1 chemical mixing
scheme in Equation 16; however, not scaled by any eÔ¨Éciency pa-
rameters for angular momentum transport. For simplicity and a
consistent treatment of angular momentum transport, we also use
these diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients for angular momentum transport when
a diÔ¨Äerent chemical mixing scheme is adopted (Mix2, see below).

15 We use a timestep control, speciÔ¨Åed in Paper II, which prevents the star
model from fully exhausting speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum in any layer.
16 Meridional currents are large-scale Ô¨Çows arising from the thermal im-
balance between the polar axis and the equatorial regions in a rotating star.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

In the INT models (see also Figure 1), we assume that the mag-
netic Ô¨Åeld is capable of establishing radially uniform (solid-body)
rotation throughout the entire star. This is representative of an ax-
isymmetric magnetic Ô¨Åeld that "freezes" rotation along the poloidal
Ô¨Åeld lines following Ferraro‚Äôs theorem (Ferraro 1937). We model
this by using the mesa controls set_uniform_am_nu_non_rot =
.true. and uniform_am_nu_non_rot = 1.d16 such that a high
diÔ¨Äusivity (ùê∑AM = 1016 cm2 s‚àí1) leads to eÔ¨Écient angular mo-
mentum transport and hence solid-body rotation throughout the en-
tire star. Unfortunately, the naming conventions here are somewhat
confusing as these controls are applied to the entire star regard-
less of the convective/radiative nature of given layers. Otherwise
"am_nu_non_rot" refers to layers of the star with convective mix-
ing. The precise value of this quantity is not crucial so long as it
achieves solid-body rotation. Above a critical value, the diÔ¨Äusivity
can saturate, meaning that an already Ô¨Çat Œ© proÔ¨Åle will remain un-
changed if an even higher diÔ¨Äusivity is applied. The mesa "default"
value for this control is ùê∑AM = 1020 cm2 s‚àí1. Such a high diÔ¨Äu-
sivity would mean a diÔ¨Äusion timescale (ùúèD ‚âà ùëü2/ùê∑AM) of a few
hours, which is physically not justiÔ¨Åed. The saturation, i.e., solid-
body rotation for a given diÔ¨Äusivity may happen for diÔ¨Äusivities
> 1010 cm2 s‚àí1, depending on model speciÔ¨Åcs such as mass and
evolutionary stage.

In the SURF models, we distinguish between three regions of
the star i) the stellar core, ii) the envelope from ùëû = 0.8 to the stellar
core, and iii) the envelope above ùëû = 0.8 in which magnetic braking
is applied (see above). On the main sequence, the cores of massive
stars are convective, dominated by strong turbulent mixing. In mesa,
this is modelled by a high diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient (relying on mixing-
length theory) that establishes a constant angular velocity proÔ¨Åle,
that is, the core is rigidly rotating. In the radiative layers between the
stellar core and the boundary of ùëû = 0.8, the usual hydrodynamical
instabilities (dynamical and secular shear, meridional circulation,
GSF instability) transport angular momentum. More directly, the
assumption here is that there is no magnetic coupling between the
stellar core and the envelope. While even for complex surface Ô¨Åelds
there may be weak dipole components in the deep stellar layers
which may contribute to angular momentum transport, we neglect
those here to be able to test a limiting, boundary case, in which
diÔ¨Äerential rotation may develop between the core and the surface.
For a consistent comparison, in both Mix1/Mix2 chemical mix-
ing schemes (see below), we apply the same treatment of angular
momentum transport in this region.

The fossil magnetic Ô¨Åeld may relax into a non-axisymmetric
conÔ¨Åguration, strongly impacting the upper stellar layers (Braith-
waite 2008). In these layers (with 20 per cent of the stellar
mass in our models), we apply a high diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient of
ùê∑AM = 1016 cm2 s‚àí1 via the other_am_mixing subroutine to
account for the expected eÔ¨Äect of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld.

In both INT and SURF cases, for layers with increased angular
momentum transport attributed to the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, the angular
momentum transport equations are of secondary importance in the
sense that we expect an appropriate transport equation to result in
a Ô¨Çat angular velocity proÔ¨Åle, thereby deviating from non-magnetic
models. One would also expect that in those layers where the fossil
magnetic Ô¨Åeld is present, hydrodynamical instabilities could not
transport angular momentum.

Further guidance regarding the internal rotation proÔ¨Åle and
magnetic Ô¨Åeld properties can also be obtained observationally using
(magneto-)asteroseismology (see recently Lecoanet et al. 2022). For
instance, radial diÔ¨Äerential rotation was observed in several massive
stars using the rotational splitting of gravity modes (e.g. Aerts et al.

10

Z. Keszthelyi et al.

2003; Triana et al. 2015). On the other hand, the nearly identical
surface and core rotation of red giant stars requires very eÔ¨Écient
transport (e.g., Moyano et al. 2022). Using asteroseismic analysis of
Kepler data, it has indeed been attributed to magnetic Ô¨Åelds (Fuller
et al. 2015). Due to possible mode suppression by strong magnetic
Ô¨Åelds, magnetoasteroseismology remains an elusive target, having
been performed for only a few massive stars (e.g. HD 43317 and
V2052 Oph; Briquet et al. 2012; Buysschaert et al. 2018). However,
the advent of nearly all-sky high-precision space-based photometry
can help further this line of inquiry, with large asteroseismic target
lists of OB stars already being assembled (e.g. Burssens et al. 2020).

2.7 Rotational mixing of chemical elements

Following Pinsonneault et al. (1989), rotational mixing of chemical
elements is commonly applied via the diÔ¨Äusion equation in one-
dimensional stellar evolution models:

where ùëãùëñ is the mass fraction of a given element ùëñ, ùë° is the time, ùëö
and ùúå are the mass coordinate and mean density at a given radius ùëü,
ùê∑chem is the sum of individual diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients contributing
to chemical mixing (see also Salaris & Cassisi 2017), and the last
term accounts for nuclear burning.

In this approach, the central question is how to encapsulate
inherently three-dimensional physical processes and apply them via
a single parameter ùê∑chem. In this study, we contrast two commonly
used approaches. Spectroscopic studies of massive stars often Ô¨Ånd
discrepancies between the observed and predicted surface abun-
dances from rotating stellar evolution models computed with a given
scheme of chemical mixing (e.g., Trundle et al. 2004; Martins et al.
2017; Markova et al. 2018). Recent works suggest that such dis-
crepancies may be resolved by including additional processes in
the calculations, for example, internal gravity waves (and magnetic
Ô¨Åelds) lead to a more complex physical interplay between various
processes and a variety of mixing proÔ¨Åles (Aerts et al. 2019; Bow-
man et al. 2020; Michielsen et al. 2021; Pedersen et al. 2021).

2.7.1 Basic thermodynamic quantities

Before introducing the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients, we brieÔ¨Çy outline the
most important thermodynamic quantities that enter into those equa-
tions. The thermal diÔ¨Äusivity is deÔ¨Åned as:

ùêæ =

(13)

where ùëé is the radiation constant, ùëê the speed of light, ùúÖ the mean
radiative opacity, ùëê ùëÉ the speciÔ¨Åc heat capacity per unit mass at
constant pressure, ùëá the temperature, ùúå the density, and ùëÉ the pres-
sure. The diÔ¨Äerent ‚àá-s below denote the advective, radiative, and
chemical composition (ùúá) gradients:

where ùëÜ is the entropy, ùúá the mean molecular weight, and ùê∫ the
gravitational constant. The local luminosity ùêø is the rate of energy

transported outward through a sphere of radius ùëü, and ùëö is the
enclosed mass. From Equation 4.22 of Maeder & Zahn (1998), the
derivatives from the equation of state are:

ùõø = ‚àí(ùúï ln ùúå/ùúï ln ùëá)ùëÉ,ùúá
ùúô = (ùúï ln ùúå/ùúï ln ùúá)ùëÉ,ùëá .

2.7.2 Mix1 scheme

(15)

A commonly used scheme of rotational mixing in stellar evolu-
tion models was developed by Kippenhahn (1974), Endal & SoÔ¨Åa
(1978), and Pinsonneault et al. (1989) and applied subsequently by
several authors. This scheme (the "default" mesa scheme, "Mix1"
hereafter) is typically used in mesa models (e.g., Paxton et al. 2013;
Choi et al. 2016). ùê∑chem is constructed as the sum of 6 individual
diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients, describing dynamical shear instability (DS),
Solberg-H√∏iland instability (SH), secular shear instability (SS),
Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability (GSF), Eddington-Sweet cir-
culation (ES), and Tayler-Spruit dynamo (ST) (see Endal & SoÔ¨Åa
1978; Pinsonneault et al. 1989; Eddington 1925; Sweet 1950; Sol-
berg 1936; H√∏iland 1941; Goldreich & Schubert 1967; Fricke 1968;
Tayler 1973; Spruit 2002).

To be able to compare our results to common model grids,
in the Mix1 scheme we adopt the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient applied in
Equation 12 as:

ùê∑Mix1

chem = ùëìc (ùê∑ES + ùê∑SS + ùê∑DS + ùê∑GSF)

(16)

where the individual diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients are described according
to Heger et al. (2000). Transport by dynamo mechanisms and by the
Solberg-H√∏iland instability are not considered as their contribution
to chemical mixing has been debated (e.g., Yoon et al. 2006; Brott
et al. 2011a). Of particular interest is the meridional circulation
term, which was described via the circulation velocity in the radial
direction by Kippenhahn (1974) and constructed into a diÔ¨Äusion
coeÔ¨Écient by Endal & SoÔ¨Åa (1978). However, the base formula-
tion of the problem in terms of a steady-state circulation by Vogt
(1925), Eddington (1925) and Sweet (1950) has been disputed by,
e.g., Busse (1981, 1982); Zahn (1992) ‚Äì see further discussion by
Rieutord (2006).

The simple summation of the various processes by Heger et al.
(2000, 2005) is often criticised on theoretical grounds as the various
processes are not independent of one another (e.g., recently Chang
& Garaud 2021, and references therein). For example, the dynamical
and secular shears act on diÔ¨Äerent timescales, and therefore their
mutual use is physically contradictory. Maeder et al. (2013) pro-
posed a diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient accounting for the interactions between
the diÔ¨Äerent physical processes. While several studies have scruti-
nised these instabilities and resulting diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients (e.g.,
Caleo et al. 2016; Goldstein et al. 2019; Barker et al. 2019, 2020;
Chang & Garaud 2021; Park et al. 2021, and references therein), a
uniÔ¨Åed description of instabilities in rotating stars is still not fully
complete.

In fully diÔ¨Äusive approaches as described above, two arbitrary
scaling factors ùëìc and ùëìùúá, introduced by Pinsonneault et al. (1989),
are commonly adopted. If chemical gradients ‚àáùúá (Equation 14) de-
velop, they may inhibit the eÔ¨Éciency of mixing. This is primarily
due to ‚àáùúá serving as a stability criterion for the development of ro-
tational instabilities (see e.g., Maeder 1997) since it appears directly
in several of the individual diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients used in Equation
16. To alter the eÔ¨Äect of chemical gradients on mixing, the scaling
factor ùëìùúá is introduced such that ‚àáùúá is replaced by ùëìùúá ¬∑ ‚àáùúá when
calculating stability criteria for various instabilities.

The parameter ùëìc, multiplying all individual diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨É-
cients in Equation 16, was Ô¨Årst calibrated to ùëìc = 0.046 by Pin-
sonneault et al. (1989). This reduction in the eÔ¨Éciency of chemical
mixing (compared to angular momentum transport) was needed to
explain the observed lithium depletion in the Sun. However, recent
studies (e.g., Prat et al. 2016) found that, at least, for the shear in-
stability, both chemical mixing and angular momentum transport
should have similar eÔ¨Éciencies when using the same diÔ¨Äusion co-
eÔ¨Écient.

Heger et al. (2000) found that

ùëìc = 0.033 with ùëìùúá = 0.05
(which were the default mesa options until recently) best reproduce
the observed nitrogen enrichment in the 10 ‚àí 20 M(cid:12) mass range
at Solar metallicity17. Yoon et al. (2006) concluded that when the
angular momentum transport is very eÔ¨Écient (by using the magnetic
term ùê∑ST accounting for the Tayler-Spruit dynamo), then ùëìc = 0.033
should be used with ùëìùúá = 0.1 instead of ùëìùúá = 0.05. Using similar
physical assumptions as Heger et al. (2000) and Yoon et al. (2006),
Brott et al. (2011a) calibrated ùëìc = 0.0228 for a 13 M(cid:12) model based
on the surface enrichment of early B stars in the LMC18 and adopted
ùëìùúá = 0.1 from Yoon et al. (2006). Recently, Markova et al. (2018)
found that this calibration produces insuÔ¨Écient mixing for more
massive stars to be compatible with observations. Some subsequent
modelling approaches even adopt a mixing eÔ¨Éciency parameter ùëìc
that is a factor of 10 higher (Aguilera-Dena et al. 2020).

When using similar physics (assuming a purely diÔ¨Äusive equa-
tion to model angular momentum transport), ChieÔ¨É & Limongi
(2013) obtained calibrations for ùëìc = 0.07 with ùëìùúá = 0.03 and
ùëìc = 0.2 with ùëìùúá = 1.0 (correctly noting the degeneracy between
these parameters). They also performed calibrations with diÔ¨Äerent
physics (using the advecto-diÔ¨Äusive equation of angular momen-
tum transport) which yielded ùëìc = 1 with ùëìùúá = 0.03 for chemical
mixing. Recently, also using a physical approach diÔ¨Äerent from the
above mentioned ones, Costa et al. (2019) used intermediate-mass
binary systems and constrained ùëìc = 0.17 with ùëìùúá = 0.47.

To be able to compare to previous works which used the same
physics, we adopt ùëìc = 0.033 and ùëìùúá = 0.1 (am_D_mix_factor =
0.033, am_gradmu_factor = 0.1) when using the Mix1 scheme 19.

2.7.3 Mix2 scheme

Another commonly used mixing scheme ("Mix2" hereafter) was de-
veloped by Zahn (1992), Chaboyer & Zahn (1992), Maeder (1997);
Maeder & Zahn (1998), Maeder & Meynet (2000). This scheme has
been applied in the Geneva stellar evolution code (genec, Eggen-
berger et al. 2008; Ekstr√∂m et al. 2012; Georgy et al. 2013; Meynet
et al. 2013; Groh et al. 2019; Keszthelyi et al. 2019; Murphy et al.
2021), as well as in modelling approaches using the rose (Potter
et al. 2012a,b) and franec codes (ChieÔ¨É & Limongi 2013). Here,
we adopt it in mesa, which treats angular momentum transport in
a fully diÔ¨Äusive scheme, unlike the above mentioned approaches.
Therefore, a direct comparison to previous works is not possible.

17 Heger et al. 2000 also comment that for an initial rotation of 200 km s‚àí1
and Ô¨Åxed ùëìùëê = 0.033, ùëìùúá ‚â• 0.25 is inconsistent with observations in the
30-60 M(cid:12) mass range.
18 These values were also adopted for their Solar and SMC models.
19 We note that presently there is a growing amount of evidence that such
a reduction in the eÔ¨Éciency of chemical mixing caused by hydrodynamical
instabilities is likely not needed at all. Instead, there exist other processes that
are simply more eÔ¨Écient in transporting angular momentum than chemical
elements, the prime candidates being internal gravity waves and internal
magnetic Ô¨Åelds (e.g., Aerts et al. 2019, and references therein).

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

The major diÔ¨Äerence is that given the eÔ¨Écient diÔ¨Äusive angular
momentum transport, strong shear mixing cannot develop. Conse-
quently, in our models with the Mix2 scheme, the main chemical
element transport is via meridional currents during most of the main
sequence evolution. This is not the case in the models of Ekstr√∂m
et al. (2012), where the advective treatment of angular momentum
transport allows for shears, which may also become the dominant
process of transporting chemical elements. As we will see (Sec-
tion 3.1, Section E), the Mix2 scheme leads to quasi-chemically
homogeneous evolution for the entire main sequence of our non-
magnetic models. Since such a behaviour is expected to be rare, we
may consider the adaptation of this mixing scheme in our models
as a limiting case for very eÔ¨Écient mixing.

bines the eÔ¨Äects of meridional currents and horizontal turbulence,

and ùëâ (ùëü) expresses the radial dependence of the horizontal com-

expressed as ùëâ (ùëü)ùëÉ2(cos Œò), where ùëÉ2 is the second Legendre poly-
nomial and Œò is the co-latitude. We set ùëâ (ùëü) = ùëà (ùëü) as a reasonable

where ùëìenerg is a free parameter set to unity. ùêªùëÉ is the local pres-
sure scale height, ùëî the gravitational acceleration, Œ© the angular

coeÔ¨Écient applied in Equation 12 is:

ùê∑Mix2

chem = ùê∑eÔ¨Ä + ùê∑shear .

20 The full expression of these terms is given by Maeder & Zahn (1998). In
our approach, we simplify this expression and adopt only the leading term
which is the Ô¨Årst term of ùê∏‚òÖ
as described by Maeder & Zahn (1998). Since
Œ©
it is a smaller term, we set ùê∏ùúá to zero.

Z. Keszthelyi et al.

In this case, the free parameters ùëìc and ùëìùúá are not used in
genec calculations. Consequently, we do not apply them in our
mesa Mix2 model calculations either (am_D_mix_factor = 1,
am_gradmu_factor = 1). To our knowledge this mixing scheme is
implemented in mesa for the Ô¨Årst time. The sum of diÔ¨Äusion coef-
Ô¨Åcients, dominated by meridional currents (ùê∑eÔ¨Ä, Equation 17) in
the solid-body rotating case are comparable in shape to the default
mesa approach which uses ùê∑ES as derived by Kippenhahn (1974)
and Pinsonneault et al. (1989). However, the amplitudes are not
equal (as shown in Figure 3).

We note here that there is some confusion in the literature
regarding the work of Chaboyer & Zahn (1992). Heger et al. (2000)
(and following publications) state that Chaboyer & Zahn (1992)
found ùëìc = 1/30 based on a theoretical approach. The work of
Chaboyer & Zahn (1992) does not introduce any scaling factors.
ùê∑eÔ¨Ä, describing the transport resulting from the interaction between
meridional currents and the strong horizontal turbulence is obtained
by integrating the equation for the transport of chemical elements
over latitudes. This integration gives rise to the numerical term of
1/30 (in their Equation 16 and our Equation 17), resulting from the
decomposition of the meridional velocity in Legendre polynomials.
This is not a scaling factor to match observations and it does not
apply to any other diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient. Similarly, in Equation 9 the
numerical term 2/3 is not an arbitrary scaling factor that one would
tailor to observations.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we Ô¨Årst consider non-magnetic models, and then
a Ô¨Åducial model with ùëÄini = 20 M(cid:12), Œ©ini/Œ©crit,ini = 0.5,
ùëçini = 0.014, and ùêµeq,ini = 3 kG within the INT/Mix1 scheme, and
follow changes in its stellar structure and evolution. In particular,
we will Ô¨Årst vary the mixing and braking schemes to investigate the
impact on stellar structure models in Section 3.1.1 and abundances
in Section 3.1.2 and in evolutionary models in Section 3.2.1. Then,
a typical HRD evolution of the INT and SURF magnetic models in
the full mass range (3 ‚Äì 60 M(cid:12)) will be addressed in Section 3.2.2,
followed by predictions for the Kiel diagram in Section 3.2.3. Nitro-
gen abundances and other schemes are also shown in Appendix E.
Finally, the initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength and metallicity will be
varied within the evolutionary models in Sections 3.2.5 and 3.2.6.

3.1 Stellar structure models

3.1.1 Chemical mixing and angular momentum transport

Figures 2, 3, and 4 show 20 M(cid:12) models at solar metallicity. These
structure models are at half-way through their core hydrogen burn-
ing phase21 (deÔ¨Åned as ùëãcore/ùëãcore,init = 0.5). In Figure 2, we show
non-magnetic models in the Mix1 (top panel) and Mix2 (lower
panel) chemical mixing schemes. (Since magnetic braking is not
applied, there is no braking scheme in these cases, hence we re-
fer to these models as "NOMAG".) In Figure 3, the Ô¨Åducial model
(INT/Mix1, top panel) as well as an otherwise initially identical
model but within the INT/Mix2 scheme (lower panel) is shown.
Models with the SURF/Mix1 and SURF/Mix2 schemes are shown
in Figure 4. Note that the models with the adopted braking and
mixing schemes correspond to diÔ¨Äerent stellar ages when the core

hydrogen is half-way depleted in each model (indicated in the ti-
tle of the panels), given the diÔ¨Äerent evolution resulting from the
change in physical assumptions.

When fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds are not considered in the models
(NOMAG case; ùêµeq = 0), the Mix1 and Mix2 chemical mixing
schemes produce drastically diÔ¨Äerent results. In the Mix1 scheme,
the mean molecular weight (shown with magenta line and on the
right ordinate) drops rapidly at the convective core boundary (the
zones with convective overshooting are shown with orange in Fig-
ure 2). Near this region the GSF instability dominates (see, e.g.,
the recent studies of Caleo et al. 2016; Barker et al. 2019, 2020;
Chang & Garaud 2021). Once the chemical composition is sta-
bilised, meridional circulation drives chemical mixing (red line)
and angular momentum transport (dotted line). Note that the as-
sumption of ùëìc = 0.033 reduces the eÔ¨Éciency of all instabilities
considered for chemical mixing compared to the eÔ¨Éciency of the
same instabilities used for angular momentum transport. The angu-
lar velocity proÔ¨Åle (right panel) remains completely Ô¨Çat in the stellar
envelope, with a small break at the core boundary. Thus the model is
very close to solid-body rotation. The NOMAG/Mix2 model reveals
a very eÔ¨Écient mixing, with an almost Ô¨Çat mean molecular weight
proÔ¨Åle indicating close-to chemically homogeneous evolution. The
dominant transport is via the eÔ¨Äective diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient (Equa-
tion 17). Importantly, the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients at the core-envelope
boundary are smooth. This is a critical region that allows for mix-
ing up material from the core to the surface. Note the much larger
convective core (in grey) compared to the Mix1 model. The speciÔ¨Åc
angular momentum (blue line, right panel) and angular velocity
proÔ¨Åles are smooth throughout the star. Œ© slightly decreases near
the surface as a result of mass loss, however, this model is also very
close to solid-body rotation.

In the INT braking scheme (Figure 3) the angular velocity pro-
Ô¨Åle is completely Ô¨Çat. The star is rigidly rotating due to the assumed
high diÔ¨Äusivity for transporting angular momentum attributed to
the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, albeit the angular rotation is much lower than
in the NOMAG model due to magnetic braking (uniformly) low-
ering the speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum. The rigid rotation does not
allow shears to develop and transport angular momentum or chem-
ical elements. Therefore in these models the chemical enrichment
is entirely driven by meridional currents. In the "standard" mesa
description (Mix1 scheme) a gap in the transport develops above
the overshooting region, corresponding to steep chemical gradients,
as seen from the large drop of the mean molecular weight (magenta
line, right ordinate) at the core boundary. Despite the mitigating
eÔ¨Äect of ùëìùúá = 0.1 in these models, the ineÔ¨Écient mixing above the
core boundary will prevent a very eÔ¨Écient surface enrichment and
overall mixing inside the star. If the gap existed throughout the en-
tire early evolution, it would completely inhibit surface enrichment.
However, the gap is not present initially ‚Äì see top panels of Fig-
ures D1 and D2 ‚Äì, when the mixing and corresponding enrichment
are prominent. With internal magnetic braking, all layers of the star
lose angular momentum, therefore the shape of the speciÔ¨Åc angu-
lar momentum proÔ¨Åle remains unchanged whereas its overall value
decreases over time. In the Mix2 scheme, ùê∑eÔ¨Ä never becomes zero
close to the convective core. This allows for a smoother composition
gradient and more overall mixing, therefore diÔ¨Äerences in surface
abundances are expected. On the other hand, the speciÔ¨Åc angular
momenta are not so diÔ¨Äerent between the Mix1 and Mix2 schemes
in the INT models. Œ© is smaller in the Mix2 model, but this quan-
tity also depends on the radius of the star. Since the model in the
INT/Mix2 scheme takes more time than the INT/Mix1 to deplete
hydrogen in its core due to the more eÔ¨Écient chemical mixing, at

Figure 2. We show a non-magnetic model of ùëÄini = 20 M(cid:12) (at ùëç = 0.014) within the NOMAG/Mix1 scheme (top panel) and an initially identical model
within the NOMAG/Mix2 scheme (lower panel) at half-way through its core hydrogen burning phase (with core hydrogen mass fraction of ùëãc/ùëãc,init ‚âà 50%).
Left: diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients for chemical mixing (solid lines for rotational mixing and shaded grey and orange for convective core mixing and overshooting,
respectively; all entering via ùê∑chem in Equation 12) and diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient for angular momentum transport (dotted line, entering Equation 11). The right
ordinate and magenta line show the mean molecular weight. Due to the stochastic nature of mixing processes and, in some cases, numerical noise, here and
hereafter we apply a moderate smoothing of some diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écients for visualisation purposes. Right: SpeciÔ¨Åc angular momentum (left ordinate, blue line)
and angular velocity (right ordinate, black line).

half-way through its core burning stage it has a larger radius. We
also note that the NOMAG/Mix2 model produces a more eÔ¨Écient
mixing than the INT/Mix2 model. As a consequence, the INT/Mix2
model results in a smaller convective core than the non-magnetic
case.

In the SURF braking scheme (Figure 4), one major diÔ¨Äerence
is that there is no overall solid-body rotation. Let us recall that
in the SURF models only the outer layers enclosing the top 20%
of the total mass of the star are assumed to lose angular momen-
tum (see Equation 10) and have an increased diÔ¨Äusivity for angular
momentum transport (via Equation 11). In a 1D diÔ¨Äusive scheme,
angular momentum Ô¨Çows from inner to outer layers. The angular
velocity proÔ¨Åle is Ô¨Çat in those layers where the diÔ¨Äusivity is in-
creased. Depending on the mixing scheme, the composition and
also the mixing processes are rather diÔ¨Äerent. The magnitude and
radial dependence of the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient for angular momen-
tum transport also determines the angular velocity in the rest of the
stellar envelope. We see that in the SURF/Mix1 model the angular
velocity is also roughly constant between 0.6 and 0.8 ùëö/ùëÄ‚òÖ, and
it gradually changes closer to the boundary of the stellar core, as
it is the case for ùê∑AM (left panel, dotted line). In the SURF/Mix2
model, ùê∑AM changes more abruptly at around 0.8 ùëö/ùëÄ‚òÖ, whereas
it is roughly constant again closer to the stellar core. Braking for a
given magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is less eÔ¨Écient in the SURF scheme
than in the INT scheme since the Alfv√©n radius is smaller for a

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

quadrupole Ô¨Åeld than for a dipole Ô¨Åeld as deÔ¨Åned by Equations 3-5.
Given the shape of the speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum proÔ¨Åle (right
panel, blue line), the SUFR/Mix1 model has a break closer to the
stellar core, while the SURF/Mix2 model has a break closer to
0.8 ùëö/ùëÄ‚òÖ. This means that the SURF/Mix2 model can more easily
exhaust its surface reservoir of angular momentum.

Certainly, further research is required to investigate how an-
gular momentum transport and magnetic braking work for more
complex magnetic Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Ågurations and how they could be im-
plemented in 1D stellar evolution models. Overall, the results from
the SURF approach may be considered similar to the works of
Meynet et al. (2011) and Paper I, where magnetic braking was only
applied to the uppermost stellar layer.

In the SURF/Mix1 scheme, the GSF instability can eÔ¨Éciently
transport chemical elements near the core boundary. This insta-
bility acts on a dynamical timescale and therefore can vary from
timestep to timestep. In the upper envelope meridional currents
remain eÔ¨Écient. In the Mix2 scheme, the free parameters control-
ling mixing eÔ¨Éciency are not applied ( ùëìùúá = 1, ùëìc = 1), and the
SURF/Mix2 scheme is thus the most eÔ¨Écient in chemical mixing.
This is also evidenced by the larger convective core size compared
to the three models in the other magnetic schemes. In fact, the con-
vective core size of the SURF/Mix2 model is similar to that of the
NOMAG/Mix2 model. Strong gradients of chemical elements do

not develop near the core boundary. Shear mixing remains eÔ¨Écient
in the entire envelope to transport chemical elements.

3.1.2 Abundances of He, C, N, O

Figure 5 shows the abundances of helium, carbon, nitrogen, and
oxygen. For three models (INT/Mix1, INT/Mix2, SURF/Mix1) the
convective hydrogen core sizes are comparable. The SURF/Mix2
scheme, which is the most eÔ¨Écient in mixing, leads to a much larger
core. In this model, the average helium content in the stellar enve-
lope is much higher and the surface will also show this increased
abundance already on the main sequence. Carbon is slightly de-
pleted during the CNO-cycle (it becomes most depleted in a thin
layer close to the core boundary), however the surface carbon abun-
dance is minimally changed in the Ô¨Årst three models. In contrast,
the SURF/Mix2 model produces an almost uniform distribution of
carbon inside the star, it is completely mixed in the envelope without
any gradients. Nitrogen excess is produced during the CNO-cycle,
and therefore, its surface abundance is a crucial measurement to
infer the eÔ¨Éciency of internal mixing. All models produce a surface
nitrogen enrichment, except the INT/Mix1 scheme. Here a strong
gradient develops between the core and the surface. While a core-
surface gradient is also present in the INT/Mix2 and SURF/Mix1
models, their envelopes have a somewhat higher mean nitrogen
abundance and their surfaces are slightly enriched in nitrogen. The
SURF/Mix2 model has an almost homogeneous nitrogen distribu-
tion in its envelope. Oxygen is depleted during the CNO-cylce.
Similar to carbon, oxygen can still remain abundant in the envelope
in the Ô¨Årst three models. The SURF/Mix2 model yields a close-to-
homogeneous oxygen distribution throughout the star. In contrast
to carbon, in all four models oxygen is depleted in the entire stellar
core. For example, the core to surface oxygen abundance can diÔ¨Äer
by an order of magnitude in the INT/Mix1 model.

The reason why strong gradients can develop (and remain in
most models) near the core boundary is related to the drop in chem-
ical mixing, identiÔ¨Åable by drops and gaps in the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨É-
cients (c.f. Figures 3-4), which in turn depend on the composition
gradients. The velocity of the diÔ¨Äusion is zero when there is no
composition gradient and it increases when the gradient increases.
This is another eÔ¨Äect that leads to reducing the diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨É-
cient. For helium, the diÔ¨Äerence between the core and the envelope
grows gently, while for nitrogen it grows faster because nitrogen is
enhanced very rapidly in the core. Thus for a given diÔ¨Äusion coef-
Ô¨Åcient, nitrogen will diÔ¨Äuse more rapidly than helium. In the Mix2
scheme, the key diÔ¨Äerences between the INT and SURF models re-
sult from their diÔ¨Äerent angular velocity proÔ¨Åles. The INT models
lose angular momentum in all layers and thus mixing becomes less
eÔ¨Écient overall. The SURF/Mix2 model has a more massive con-
vective core at the same evolutionary stage (c.f. Figure 4), and the
envelope closely reÔ¨Çects on the core composition as this model has
an almost homogeneous distribution of chemical elements. In both
INT/Mix1 and INT/Mix2 schemes, envelope mixing has a similar
overall eÔ¨Éciency. However, in the INT/Mix2 scheme, the near core
mixing is more eÔ¨Écient (see above), greatly impacting the mea-
surable surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The
surface abundances, especially of nitrogen, are sensitive to the cho-
sen braking and mixing schemes, especially with the Mix2 scheme
reÔ¨Çecting more closely the core composition than the Mix1 scheme.

3.2.1

Impact of magnetic braking and chemical mixing schemes
for 20 M(cid:12) models

Figure 6 shows the Ô¨Åducial 20 M(cid:12) model (INT/Mix1) as well as
initially identical models but in the other 3 schemes in the HRD, Kiel
diagram, and Hunter diagram22 (Hunter et al. 2008, 2009). Here
we address the impact of using the diÔ¨Äerent braking and mixing
schemes for otherwise identical models with the same initial mass
and initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength.

The models within the Mix1 chemical mixing scheme result in
closely overlapping tracks on the HRD and Kiel diagrams. However,
as evidenced from the Hunter diagram (right panel of Figure 6), the
spin-down and chemical enrichment are diÔ¨Äerent when consider-
ing the diÔ¨Äerent magnetic braking schemes. The 20 M(cid:12) INT/Mix1
model (solid line) produces essentially no observable surface ni-
trogen enrichment in this conÔ¨Åguration. The SURF/Mix1 model
(dashed-dotted line), on the other hand, maintains a higher angular
velocity in the inner regions of the star by braking only the upper
layers (see Section 3.1). This is why mixing remains more eÔ¨É-
cient and a larger amount of nitrogen is mixed to the stellar surface
(0.45 dex). Model predictions within the Mix2 chemical mixing
scheme produce a much more eÔ¨Écient chemical mixing than the
Mix1 scheme. However, the diÔ¨Äerences between the INT/Mix2 and
INT/Mix1 schemes are relatively modest on the HRD and Kiel
diagrams, while the Hunter diagram shows large deviations. The
INT/Mix2 model reaches a surface nitrogen abundance that is about
0.4 dex higher than the baseline value.

Contrary to the Ô¨Årst three cases, the SURF/Mix2 model has
an extended blueward evolution, shown on the HRD and Kiel di-
agrams. Such a feature is commonly associated with blue strag-
glers, merger products, and quasi-chemically homogeneous evolu-
tion (e.g., Maeder 1987; Yoon et al. 2006; Knigge et al. 2009).
Given the very eÔ¨Écient mixing in this model, it is nearly chemically
homogeneous (c.f. Figure 5). Indeed, the SURF/Mix2 model pro-
duces the highest nitrogen enrichment, more than 1 dex compared
to the baseline in this conÔ¨Åguration.

Even without considering magnetic braking, the two mixing
schemes are considerably diÔ¨Äerent, which leads to diÔ¨Äerent evolu-
tionary tracks. The assumptions regarding the mutual eÔ¨Äect of the
magnetic Ô¨Åeld and chemical mixing allow for a range of behaviours
(see also Paper III). Models within the Mix1 scheme have mod-
est diÔ¨Äerences as a result of using the diÔ¨Äerent braking schemes
(INT/SURF). Models within the Mix2 scheme produce very eÔ¨É-
cient mixing, which is more easily quenched in the INT models than
in the SURF models. The INT braking scheme, in contrast to the
SURF, decreases the overall rotation rate, and the INT/Mix2 models
do not evolve signiÔ¨Åcantly blueward on the HRD. However, quasi-
chemically homogeneous evolution is achieved in the case of non-
magnetic Mix2 models, as well as in some magnetic SURF/Mix2
models depending on the initial Ô¨Åeld strength and stellar mass (see
Figs. E3 and E4, in the Appendix). For example, the magnetic model
in the SURF/Mix2 scheme leads to quasi-chemically homogeneous
evolution for most of the main sequence (‚âà 9 Myr out of 12 Myr) of
a 20 M(cid:12) model at solar metallicity with a 3 kG magnetic Ô¨Åeld. How-

22 We use the spectroscopic deÔ¨Ånition of nitrogen abundance for the Hunter
diagram, which is log( ùëÅ /ùêª ) + 12, where ùëÅ and ùêª are the surface number
fraction of nitrogen and hydrogen. Note that mass fractions (which are the
typical output quantities from evolutionary grids) need to be translated to
number fraction by appropriate scaling.

to achieve this, while it is slightly over 8 Myr for the SURF/Mix2
model. The SURF/Mix1 model reaches the TAMS with a somewhat
higher rotation rate than the other models.

In summary, the braking and mixing schemes can drastically
change the main observable characteristics. For example, the 8 Myr
isochrone spans over a 10 kK eÔ¨Äective temperature range (left panel
of Figure 6) despite the models being initially completely identi-
cal. (When the "extreme" case of SURF/Mix2, which is assumed
to represent stars with complex magnetic Ô¨Åelds and very eÔ¨Écient
mixing, is not considered the diÔ¨Äerence is less, around 2 kK.) Thus
the uncertainties associated with braking and mixing schemes in
evolutionary model predictions are signiÔ¨Åcant. From the Hunter di-
agram we can conclude that various braking and mixing schemes
can cover a wide range of rotation rates and surface nitrogen abun-
dances. Three models already reach slow rotation (< 50 km s‚àí1)
with high surface gravities. Both INT models take less than 6 Myr

3.2.2 HRD evolution of a grid of magnetic models

Figure 7 shows the model predictions on the HRD colour-coded
by the surface equatorial rotational velocity. Here the INT/Mix1
and INT/Mix2 schemes are displayed (see Figs. E2 and E4 in the
Appendix for the SURF schemes) and we demonstrate the impact
of a magnetic Ô¨Åeld with an initial equatorial Ô¨Åeld strength of 500 G.
In the INT models, strong magnetic braking leads to a rapid
decrease of surface rotational velocity in the entire mass range from
3 to 60 M(cid:12). This implies that rapidly-rotating (single) magnetic
massive stars are expected to be young and close to the ZAMS on
the HRD. Some quantitative diÔ¨Äerences arise from the assumptions

of the chemical mixing schemes. Nonetheless, within the INT mag-
netic braking scheme these diÔ¨Äerences are small on the HRD, albeit
it could aÔ¨Äect the parameter determination (current age and mass)
of known magnetic stars.

3.2.3 DiÔ¨Äerential rotation on the Kiel diagram

Figure 8 shows the Kiel diagram. In the SURF models, radial dif-
ferential rotation develops between the stellar core23 and surface,
as indicated with the grey contour lines. This is because we assume
that a magnetic Ô¨Åeld with a complex geometry would only exert a
strong torque on the near-surface layers by considering that organ-
ised, strong magnetic Ô¨Çux is not present in deeper stellar layers (see
also Braithwaite & Nordlund 2006; Braithwaite 2008). Thus angu-
lar momentum transport in the deepest layers of the stellar envelope
is dominated by ‚Äì less eÔ¨Écient ‚Äì hydrodynamical instabilities. On
the other hand, in the INT models complete solid-body rotation
is maintained throughout the main sequence. Similar to Figure 6,
where the 20 M(cid:12) models are discussed, we see that the Mix1 and
Mix2 chemical mixing schemes (within the SURF braking scheme
here) result in notable diÔ¨Äerences in observable stellar parameters,
which are the most prominent in the 5-10 M(cid:12) range.

If the assumed magnetic Ô¨Åeld geometry remained unchanged
throughout the main-sequence evolution, the prediction for mag-
netic massive stars is that diÔ¨Äerential rotation could be best identi-
Ô¨Åed in hotter, more massive, and more evolved (lower log ùëî) stars.
An important caveat nevertheless is the time evolution of complex
magnetic Ô¨Åelds. According to Braithwaite (2008), complex Ô¨Åelds

23 Here, we use the mesa output quantity of core angular velocity
"center_omega" to determine the rotation of the stellar core. The exact
radius to obtain Œ©c is not essential since the entire stellar core has the same
angular velocity.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

may simplify to a dipolar form since higher-order harmonics dif-
fuse more rapidly. Indeed, Shultz et al. (2019b) Ô¨Ånds that evolved
magnetic stars tend to have simpler geometries (however, see also
Kochukhov et al. 2019). Insofar it remains unclear what the exact
diÔ¨Äusion time of complex magnetic Ô¨Çux tubes would be (perhaps
still longer than the main-sequence lifetime) and whether the corre-
sponding eÔ¨Äects which are modelled in evolutionary codes (angu-
lar momentum transport, magnetic braking, mass-loss quenching)
would change signiÔ¨Åcantly. We evaluated the models with diÔ¨Äerent
initial Ô¨Åeld strengths and found that a stronger magnetic Ô¨Åeld is able
to achieve a higher degree of diÔ¨Äerential rotation in comparison to
models with lower Ô¨Åeld strengths. It would therefore be of great
importance to obtain seismic data of a sample of magnetic massive
stars.

3.2.4 Mass-dependent rotational evolution
Both the HRD and Kiel diagrams presented above24 show the same
distinctive feature. Namely, irrespective of how fast the spin-down
per given scheme is, the mid-mass range models (‚âà 5-10 M(cid:12), the
transition typically taking place at around 5-7 M(cid:12) depending on
model assumptions) always maintain a higher rotational velocity
than models with other masses. This is the most striking on the
left panel of Figure 8 for the SURF/Mix1 scheme. (The exact model
behaviour was also recognised for a 5 and 10 M(cid:12) model in Paper II.)
The distinctive feature is a consequence of the spin-down of the
models, which does not scale linearly with mass. For higher-mass
models, wind mass loss contributes to the spin-down. The spin-
down time to reach a given surface rotation takes a lower fractional
age when the mass increases for initial masses higher than 10 M(cid:12).
Since stars below about 5 M(cid:12) have much longer nuclear timescales
than higher-mass stars, even if magnetic braking is less eÔ¨Écient

(left) and SURF/Mix2 (right) schemes. Grey contour lines indicate the unitless degree of diÔ¨Äerential rotation, quantiÔ¨Åed as the ratio of core to surface angular
velocity. Note that Figure 7 shows INT models where solid-body rotation (Œ©core/Œ©surf = 1) is achieved throughout the main sequence (see also Figure D1).
The initial masses of the models decrease from left to right. The colour-coding shows the surface equatorial rotational velocity.

due to weaker winds, the available timescale allows for braking the
rotation at a lower fractional main-sequence age. This results in stars
below 5 M(cid:12) rotating more slowly at the TAMS than in the 5-10 M(cid:12)
range. We emphasise that the extent of the tracks on the HRD is not
linear with stellar age: a signiÔ¨Åcant time evolution can take place in a
narrow location on the HRD close to the ZAMS as demonstrated by
the isochrones. For example, the 50 M(cid:12) model spends the Ô¨Årst 2 Myr
of its evolution while decreasing its ùëáeÔ¨Ä by only about 5 kK, whereas
in the second 2 Myr of its evolution, its ùëáeÔ¨Ä decreases by about 15
kK (Figure 7). Moreover, from 0 to 4 Myr, the 25 M(cid:12) track evolves
roughly 0.2 dex in luminosity and a few kK in ùëáeÔ¨Ä, which is a typical
range of observational uncertainties depending on data quality and
knowledge of distance and extinction. The precise age determination
of young stars especially at initial masses below 25 M(cid:12) becomes
rather challenging with uncertainties well exceeding 1 Myr.

In summary, stars evolve slowly in the HRD at the beginning of
the main sequence phase, and thus suÔ¨Äer strong magnetic braking
while not evolving away from the ZAMS (in eÔ¨Äective temperature
and luminosity). However the interplay between the dependence on
the initial mass of the meridional current velocity, the evolutionary
timescale near the ZAMS and the evolution of the radius produces
a small bump of the surface rotational velocity in the initial mass
range of 5-10 M(cid:12) (see also Paper II). At the TAMS, this gives rise
to a slower rotational velocity in models below 5 M(cid:12) than models
in the mid-mass range.

3.2.5

Impact of varying the initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strength

Figure 9 shows the impact of the initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strength within the INT/Mix1 scheme on the HRD, Kiel, and Hunter
diagrams for models from 3 to 60 M(cid:12). The colour-coding of the
surface rotational velocity on the HRD and Kiel diagrams show
that for initial masses above 30 M(cid:12), stellar winds play a signiÔ¨Åcant
role in depleting the angular momentum reservoir, and thus even

without magnetic Ô¨Åelds those stars can signiÔ¨Åcantly spin down on
the main sequence. However, in the mass range from 3 to 30 M(cid:12)
single-star models would not undergo a dramatic angular momen-
tum loss unless they were strongly magnetised. As demonstrated
in the Ô¨Ågure, the stronger the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, the more rapidly the
surface rotation brakes. In particular, already a 3 kG equatorial Ô¨Åeld
would produce a (sub)population of stars whose surface rotation is
less than 50 km s‚àí1 throughout essentially the entire main sequence.

The Kiel diagram shows yet another consequence of magnetic
Ô¨Åelds. Apart from the highest-mass models (> 30M(cid:12)), the mod-
els with stronger magnetic Ô¨Åelds tend to reach the end of the main
sequence with higher surface gravities. For example, for a 10 M(cid:12)
model, the TAMS value of log ùëî increases from 3.3 to 3.4 and to
3.5 from the 0 kG to the 0.5 kG and to the 3 kG models, respec-
tively. Non-magnetic models maintain a higher rotation and thus
the mixing remains more eÔ¨Écient. This mixing (if not too strong
to keep the star in a bluer position in the HRD) tends to enlarge
the convective core and consequently, extend the width of the main
sequence towards lower eÔ¨Äective temperatures and higher surface
gravities.

The Hunter diagram reveals that the magnetic models may
strongly deviate from non-magnetic model predictions. The stronger
the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, the more rapidly rotation brakes, and the less ni-
trogen can be mixed to the stellar surface. We identify and demon-
strate that there exists a cutoÔ¨Ä magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, above which
no surface enrichment is expected given that it leads to a shorter
magnetic braking timescale compared to the rotational mixing
timescale. However, this cutoÔ¨Ä Ô¨Åeld strength is strongly model and
parameter dependent, and thus the exact value varies for given stel-
lar mass, initial rotation, metallicity, and mixing scheme, amongst
others. We evaluate this in Section 4.2.

3.2.6

Impact of metallicity

Figure 10 shows the impact of the initial metallicity (here, for LMC
and SMC values; the Solar metallicity models with the same input
are shown in the lower panels of Figure 9) for 3 to 60 M(cid:12) models
with initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths of 3 kG within the
INT/Mix1 scheme on the HRD, Kiel, and Hunter diagrams. At lower
metallicity, the ZAMS is shifted to higher eÔ¨Äective temperatures
given that the stellar models are more compact due to the lower

opacity and lower mean molecular weight. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the lower
CNO abundances impose further contraction of a star to initiate
core burning.

Magnetic braking, in our formalism, is metallicity indepen-
dent. However, rotational mixing is not. The various mixing pre-
scriptions depend on chemical composition and their gradients,
which in turn aÔ¨Äects the evolution of surface rotational velocity
as most prominently revealed on the Kiel diagrams. For example,
for a given value of a diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient, the mixing timescale

is ùúè ‚âà ùëÖ2/ùê∑chem. Since stars are more compact in lower ùëç, the
timescale becomes shorter. Consequently, the changes in rotation
and surface abundances can be more impacted in lower metallicity
stars.

Similarly, the highest relative nitrogen enrichment is seen when
metallicity is the lowest (see also e.g. Brott et al. 2011a; Georgy
et al. 2013). Let us recall that Figure 10 shows the INT/Mix1 mod-
els, which ‚Äì in our approach ‚Äì are the lowest estimates for the surface
enrichment (c.f. Figure 6). The other schemes predict higher surface
nitrogen enrichment when combining the eÔ¨Äects with low metallic-
ity. The trends produced in magnetic massive star models are unique
since they lead to simultaneous surface nitrogen enrichment and a
rapid spin-down of the stellar surface (c.f. Paper I, Paper II). The
rapid spin-down could otherwise only be expected for very massive
stars with extremely strong stellar winds.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Slowly-rotating nitrogen enriched stars in the LMC

The projected rotational velocities of massive stars in the Magellanic
Clouds appear to follow a bi-modal distribution (e.g., Dufton et al.
2013, 2018, 2019, 2020; Rivero Gonz√°lez et al. 2012; Ram√≠rez-
Agudelo et al. 2013, 2015). The bi-modality is also observed for
intermediate-mass stars up to about 5 M(cid:12) (e.g., Bastian et al. 2020;

Sun et al. 2021). The observed slowly-rotating red main sequence
stars and rapidly-rotating blue main sequence stars are thought to be
evidence for main sequence splitting (e.g., Bastian et al. 2020) and
an extended main sequence turn-oÔ¨Ä (e.g., D‚ÄôAntona et al. 2015). It
has been suggested that the low-velocity peak might be caused by
magnetic braking (e.g., WolÔ¨Ä et al. 1982; Sun et al. 2021). Shultz
et al. (2018) demonstrated that the dichotomy in ùë£ sin ùëñ between
Galactic B-type stars with and without magnetic Ô¨Åelds is at least
qualitatively consistent with the lower ùë£ sin ùëñ values observed in the
magnetic population. For observed massive stars in the Magellanic
Clouds, a notable fraction of slow-rotators were found to show
measurable nitrogen enrichment, which challenges typical, non-
magnetic single-star evolutionary models (Lennon et al. 1996, 2003;
Dufton et al. 2006, 2013, 2018, 2019, 2020; Rivero Gonz√°lez et al.
2012; Ram√≠rez-Agudelo et al. 2013, 2015; McEvoy et al. 2015; Grin
et al. 2017).

The nitrogen-enriched slow-rotators (also known as "Group
2" stars, Hunter et al. 2008) correspond to roughly 20% of the
population in the LMC (e.g., Hunter et al. 2008; Brott et al. 2011b;
Grin et al. 2017; Dufton et al. 2018). In the Galaxy, the observed
incidence rate of fossil magnetism is found to be ‚âà 10% (e.g.,
Fossati et al. 2016; Grunhut et al. 2017; Sikora et al. 2019a) and
it has previously been suggested that at least some of the Group 2
stars could be explained by magnetism (Meynet et al. 2011; Potter
et al. 2012b, Paper I). This would require an incidence rate of fossil

magnetism in the LMC that is likely higher than the 10% observed
in the Galaxy25. In addition, the (initial) magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength
distribution is not yet known in our galaxy or in other metallicity
environments; however, see Petit et al. (2019) and Cerrahoƒülu et al.
(2020) for theoretical models. It could also be that the Group 2 stars
require an additional channel to explain all observations. In fact,
binarity has been suggested by, e.g., Song et al. (2018b).

Figure 11 shows the Hunter diagram with models represen-
tative of LMC metallicity (ùëç = 0.0064). Let us recall that we

25 For example, lower metallicity environments might favour a higher inci-
dence rate of stars with fossil Ô¨Åelds if the convective expulsion scenario, due
to the sub-surface iron opacity bump, regulates the incidence rate (Jermyn

speciÔ¨Åcally adopted an initial nitrogen abundance in our models
of log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 = 7.15 from Dopita et al. (2019) to produce
evolutionary models guided by available empirical baseline abun-
dance determinations. Here we demonstrate some of the complex
parameter-space dependences that magnetic single-star models pro-
duce, albeit strongly depending on the model assumptions, espe-
cially the mixing and braking schemes (see also Meynet et al. 2011;
Potter et al. 2012b, Paper I, Paper III). We display the non-magnetic
models as well as magnetic models in the two braking and two mix-
ing schemes. The initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is 3 kG
and the initial rotation is set by Œ©ini/Œ©ini,crit = 0.5. These assump-
tions produce evolutionary models, which over time reasonably
approximate mean values measured from observations (magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strengths from, e.g., Shultz et al. 2018 for Galactic magnetic
B-type stars, and rotational velocities from, e.g., Dufton et al. 2013

22

Z. Keszthelyi et al.

for massive stars in the Magellanic Clouds). For example, the 3
kG initial ZAMS magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength weakens by roughly an
order of magnitude (since ùêµeq ‚àù ùëÖ‚àí2
‚òÖ over time) at the TAMS to
300 G. Only models with initial masses from 15 to 60 M(cid:12) are
shown given that the available instrumentation allows magnitude
limited observation of bright LMC stars that are more massive than
‚âà 15 M(cid:12) (e.g., Schneider et al. 2018). Thus the models are the most
representative of O (and early B-type) stars.

Non-magnetic models (black and grey lines for the Mix1 and
Mix2 schemes, respectively) mostly show high rotational veloci-
ties. Close to the TAMS, the NOMAG/Mix2 models spin down
eÔ¨Éciently and yield a high N/H ratio. However, this prediction is
associated with producing Helium stars since these models experi-
ence Wolf-Rayet type mass loss due to their quasi-chemically ho-
mogeneous main sequence evolution (see Section D2). This helps to
decrease the surface hydrogen abundance signiÔ¨Åcantly, and hence
the N/H ratio can further increase. Given the high eÔ¨Äective tem-
peratures that these models show close to the TMAS, we do not
expect that the non-magnetic models should match the observations
of typical Group 2 stars.

Chemical mixing remains challenging to constrain. The
schemes that we assume in this work cover a large area on the Hunter
diagram, which represents modelling uncertainties. In our models,
for a given initial rotation and initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, the
INT/Mix1 and SURF/Mix2 models lead to the smallest and highest
amount of nitrogen enrichment, respectively (see also Figure 6).
The INT/Mix2 and SURF/Mix1 models produce similar results, al-
though the latter models cover a narrower domain. In this sense, the
Mix1 and Mix2 schemes are limiting cases in terms of the produced
nitrogen enrichment from our models. In nature, the situation might
be much more complex since, for example, the study of slowly-
pulsating B-type stars reveals a diverse range of mixing proÔ¨Åles
(Pedersen et al. 2021). The variation of these proÔ¨Åles over time is
not yet quantiÔ¨Åed.

The magnetic properties of stars in the LMC remain unknown.
For this reason, the INT and SURF braking schemes represent as-
sumptions and uncertainties that could only be resolved if, at least,
upper limits on the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths were constrained. From
the models we see that for a given initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength,
the INT models produce less enrichment than the SURF models in
a given mixing scheme.

In Figure 11 we show abundance measurements26 of observed
massive stars at the LMC made by Grin et al. (2017) and Dufton
et al. (2018). Since the observations only allow derivation of the
projected rotational velocity ùë£ sin ùëñ, we scale the actual rotational
velocity in our models with sin(ùúã/4) to account for an average
inclination angle. We only consider here observations with ùë£ sin ùëñ <
300 km s‚àí1.

The observations reveal a large scatter, which likely repre-
sents a range of initial conditions (mass, rotation rates, magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strength, binarity, etc.) and current age. The data from Grin
et al. (2017) and Dufton et al. (2018) indicate stars in their main
sequence evolutionary stages with surface gravities systematically
decreasing towards lower rotation rates. Our models show that mag-
netic braking typically yields slowly-rotating stars early on in the
evolution, still with high surface gravities. Once the rotation is slow
(and log ùëî is still ‚âà 4.0), chemical mixing becomes ineÔ¨Écient and

26 Although the observations of supergiants by McEvoy et al. (2015) are
available, our models only cover the main sequence evolution and thus we
refrain from a direct comparison to more evolved stars.

no further surface enrichment may be expected on the main se-
quence. This is the primary reason why magnetic models produce
less surface enrichment than non-magnetic models with the same
mixing assumptions (see also Figure E1). However, at this point,
the magnetic models still evolve further in time, albeit their location
does not change in the Hunter diagram. Thus the magnetic models
decrease their surface gravities (to log ùëî ‚âà 3.0) in a narrow region
in the Hunter diagram, when their (assumed projected) surface ro-
tational velocities are below 50 km s‚àí2 in all cases, except for the
SURF/Mix1 models where the spin-down is the least eÔ¨Écient (c.f.
Section 3.2.1).

There are several other caveats, which hamper a quantitative
comparison between the models and observations. For example, the
mass determinations are uncertain and often rely on (non-magnetic)
evolutionary models. As we demonstrate in Figure 11, even for an
idealised situation where the braking and mixing schemes were
known for a given magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, the produced nitrogen
enrichment is still a function of initial mass (see also Aerts et al.
2014; Maeder et al. 2014). In the INT/Mix1 scheme, the Ô¨Ånal ni-
trogen abundance becomes a factor of 2.5 higher when increasing
the stellar mass from 15 to 60 M(cid:12). This diÔ¨Äerence is less in the
INT/Mix2 and SURF/Mix1 schemes (factor of ‚âà1.5), while this
trend reverses for the SURF/Mix2 scheme.

Despite all these uncertainties, the models incorporating the
eÔ¨Äects of surface fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds can cover the region on
the Hunter diagram where the "anomalous" Group 2 stars (slow
rotation along with surface nitrogen enrichment, see Hunter et al.
2008) are located, which is not possible with standard main se-
quence evolutionary models of single stars (see Martins et al. 2017
for non-magnetic ‚âà 30 M(cid:12) models in the Galaxy). In particular,
for the slowly-rotating non-magnetic Mix2 models the produced
nitrogen enrichment seems to be larger than indicated by observa-
tions, whereas the non-magnetic Mix1 models do not spin down
suÔ¨Éciently.

Since the parameter space is degenerate, not only the mixing
and braking scheme could produce results that cover Group 2 stars
but also the variation of initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength in a given
scheme. A stronger initial Ô¨Åeld would yield less enrichment (Fig-
ure 9), possibly explaining the less nitrogen enriched stars, whereas
a weaker initial Ô¨Åeld could be compatible with the most highly
enriched stars (see Figure E1). To quantify this, we introduce and
discuss the cutoÔ¨Ä magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength in the next section.

4.2 CutoÔ¨Ä magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths in the LMC

It is of interest to evaluate a critical value of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld that
strongly impacts observable properties. In particular, what range of
initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths allow for producing Group 2 stars?
To this extent, we deÔ¨Åne a cutoÔ¨Ä (maximum) Ô¨Åeld strength ùêµmax,N
as the initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength in a given model that
allows for producing more than 0.1 dex of surface nitrogen enrich-
ment (in spectroscopic units) during its main sequence evolution.
If the initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is higher than ùêµmax,N, then the
mixing is ineÔ¨Écient due to the magnetic spin-down, and no nitro-
gen enrichment can be observed. Similar to the above deÔ¨Ånition,
we may also deÔ¨Åne a cutoÔ¨Ä (minimum) magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength that
is the initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength needed to produce
suÔ¨Éciently slow rotators (ùë£rot < 71 km s‚àí1) by the end of the main
sequence evolution. Any value higher than ùêµmin,v will yield slow-
rotating models; however, values below ùêµmin,v will still result in
considerable rotational velocities at the TAMS. Figure 12 shows the
range of possible initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths that are

able to produce Group 2 stars given the constraints given above.
ùêµmax,N is shown with solid line and ùêµmin,v with dashed line. The
range is shown as a function of initial mass for the LMC (the So-
lar and SMC metallicty models are discussed in Appendix F). The
cutoÔ¨Ä Ô¨Åeld strengths depend on the initial rotation rates, metallic-
ity, mass, and chemical mixing and magnetic braking schemes. We
discuss now the latter three.

Models within the INT/Mix1 scheme result in the lowest value
of ùêµmax,N since this scheme is the least eÔ¨Écient in chemical mix-
ing. However, stronger magnetic Ô¨Åelds would brake the rotation
faster than the timescale of rotational mixing. In contrast, models
within the SURF/Mix2 scheme have such strong mixing that even
a 50 kG equatorial Ô¨Åeld strength is insuÔ¨Écient to inhibit mixing27.
A particular feature, a jump in ùêµmin,v around 5 to 10 M(cid:12), can be
explained by the mass-dependent rotational behaviour of the mod-
els discussed in Section 3.2.4. In most models, the decreasing value
of ùêµmin,v for stars more massive than 10 M(cid:12) implies that stronger
stellar winds aid the spin-down thus a weaker magnetic Ô¨Åeld is
suÔ¨Écient to achieve slow-rotating stars.

We Ô¨Ånd that equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åelds of initially a few kG
are able to produce Group 2 stars in the INT/Mix1 scheme. Nev-
ertheless, the range of allowed initial Ô¨Åeld strengths is the most
limited in this case. In fact, models below 6 M(cid:12) are in a "forbidden"
range where the minimum Ô¨Åeld strengths needed to brake rotation
are higher than the maximum Ô¨Åeld strengths allowed to produce
nitrogen enrichment. In the INT/Mix2 scheme, a much larger range
of initial Ô¨Åeld strengths are allowed to produce Group 2 stars, par-
ticularly from 22 M(cid:12), where the lower limit drops to 250 G. For
initial masses higher than 7 M(cid:12), the upper limit is of the order of
10 kG to produce Group 2 stars.

Models within the SURF/Mix1 and SURF/Mix2 schemes
(right panel of Figure 12) cover a wide range of possible initial
Ô¨Åeld strengths. The SURF/Mix1 scheme produces a similar mass-
dependent pattern as the models in the INT scheme. Namely, models
from 10 M(cid:12) have systematically decreasing values of ùêµmin,v. How-

27 For visualisation purposes, we assigned 60 kG to those models where
the maximum value in our grid of models (50 kG) was still insuÔ¨Écient to
prevent nitrogen enrichment.

ever, for initial masses lower than 17 M(cid:12) a 10 kG initial equatorial
Ô¨Åeld strength is still needed to achieve slow rotation. Interestingly,
for initial masses ‚â• 19 M(cid:12) there is a dip in ùêµmax,N, staying constant
at 30 kG in contrast to the mass range of 7-18 M(cid:12), where the 50 kG
initial equatorial Ô¨Åeld strength still allows for producing nitrogen
enrichment. The SURF/Mix2 models have a constant upper limit
given by ùêµmax,N, meaning that even the strongest initial magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strength we considered in this study is not suÔ¨Écient to prevent
nitrogen enrichment on the main sequence. The lower limit given by
ùêµmin,v is constant for initial masses higher than 6 M(cid:12). In general,
we can conclude that the INT scheme favours lower values for the
cutoÔ¨Ä magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths of ùêµmax,N to produce Group 2 stars
and the SURF scheme allows for higher values of ùêµmax,N. It is quite
remarkable that the upper limit remains roughly constant in the INT
cases for stars more massive than about 10 M(cid:12). In the SURF/Mix2
case, likely an unrealistically strong magnetic Ô¨Åeld would be needed
to prevent nitrogen enrichment (as the 50 kG Ô¨Åeld is still insuÔ¨É-
cient). The Mix1 scheme tends to allow for a narrow range of values
and Mix2 scheme covers a wide range of possible solutions.

In the LMC, both quantities used in our criteria, surface nitro-
gen abundance and (projected) rotational velocity, can be measured.
Large-scale surveys dedicated to magnetic Ô¨Åeld measurements are
not yet available in lack of high-resolution spectropolarimetry (how-
ever, see Bagnulo et al. 2017, 2020). This means that our predictions
can be used as constraints on the strengths of magnetic Ô¨Åelds that
might exist in slowly-rotating nitrogen-enriched ("Group 2") stars in
the Magellanic Clouds. An initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength
above ùêµmin,v and below ùêµmax,N will produce stars that can be iden-
tiÔ¨Åed as Group 2 stars.

4.3 Future work

The models presented in this work cover the main sequence phase
of single stars. Logical extensions include calculating pre-main se-
quence models and continuing the computations to the post-main se-
quence phase to be able to scrutinise connections with end-products
of stellar evolution, such as strongly magnetised white dwarfs and
neutron stars (magnetars). The recently discovered link between
magnetars and fast-radio bursts (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.

24

Z. Keszthelyi et al.

2020; Bochenek et al. 2020) further supports investigations of the
magnetic Ô¨Åeld origin of magnetars (e.g., Spruit 2009; Makarenko
et al. 2021). Our grid of models could be further extended to cover
initial masses below 3 M(cid:12) and thus to compare with, for example,
Ap stars. This requires some further considerations about the winds
of these objects and the inclusion of atomic diÔ¨Äusion in the mod-
els. We assumed single-star models in this work. Some magnetic
massive stars, such as ùúè Sco (Schneider et al. 2016, 2019, 2020;
Keszthelyi et al. 2021), may challenge this scenario. Nonetheless,
the vast majority of OBA stars with fossil Ô¨Åelds have characteristics
that do not require invoking a merger event. In particular, fossil
magnetic Ô¨Åelds are detected in young massive stars, for example, in
ùúé Ori E (Landstreet & Borra 1978; Townsend et al. 2010; Oksala
et al. 2012; Song et al. 2021). Certain binary systems also present
challenges to the merger scenario, such as the doubly-magnetic bi-
nary ùúñ Lupi (Shultz et al. 2015) and the eclipsing late B-type binary
HD 62658, which comprises two young nearly-identical stars in
a circularised orbit, only one of which is magnetic (Shultz et al.
2019c). Thus single-star models presented in this work are a rea-
sonable Ô¨Årst approach; however, future work remains to address
binarity and mergers in combination with fossil Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects. In par-
ticular, multiplicity is common among massive stars (Sana et al.
2012, 2014; de Mink et al. 2013, 2014) and while close magnetic
binary systems are rare (e.g., Alecian et al. 2013; Shultz et al. 2018),
the mutual impact of magnetism and tidal interactions need to be
further studied (e.g., Song et al. 2018a; Vidal et al. 2018).

The models computed in this work can be confronted with ob-
servations of known magnetic massive stars. They will complement
previous approaches which relied on grids of stellar evolution mod-
els that did not include surface magnetic Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects (e.g., Brott
et al. 2011a; Ekstr√∂m et al. 2012; ChieÔ¨É & Limongi 2013; Choi
et al. 2016) to infer stellar parameters and ages of magnetic stars.
The diÔ¨Äerences are expected to be most pronounced for higher-mass
stars (Petit et al. 2017), whereas ‚Äì within the framework considered
here ‚Äì the lower-mass, A-type stars should be less impacted (Deal
et al. 2021). Nonetheless, the available TESS data and continuous
spectropolarimetric monitoring can be used to constrain accurate
rotation periods of such stars and directly compare with evolution-
ary models incorporating magnetic braking.

The INT models represent stars with strong, predominantly
dipolar Ô¨Åelds that are commonly identiÔ¨Åed in the sample of known
magnetic massive stars. The SURF models are a limiting case mo-
tivated by stars with complex magnetic Ô¨Åelds. In the future, the
implementation of diÔ¨Äerent magnetic Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Ågurations and their
time evolution could be considered to improve the present models.
The internal mixing eÔ¨Éciency remains uncertain in evolution-
ary modelling. In our models, quasi-chemically homogeneous evo-
lution during the main sequence develops in the non-magnetic Mix2
case. In the INT/Mix2 models this behaviour is prevented by the eÔ¨É-
cient overall spin-down already when initially weak magnetic Ô¨Åelds
are considered, whereas in the SURF/Mix2 models a very eÔ¨Écient
mixing still remains. The occurrence and duration of quasi-chemical
evolution depends on the initial Ô¨Åeld strength and stellar mass; some
SURF/Mix2 models evolve signiÔ¨Åcantly bluewards, whereas some
models turn to a redward evolution after mixing becomes less ef-
Ô¨Åcient (see Figure D4). Quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution
is expected to be rare in nature; however, it may be a crucial chan-
nel, for example, for some supernova events, gamma-ray bursts, or
gravitational wave sources (e.g., Georgy et al. 2012; Martins et al.
2013; de Mink & Mandel 2016; Sz√©csi 2017).

Observational studies should help constrain the mixing eÔ¨É-
ciency and ultimately the physical mixing processes. As such, it

would be beneÔ¨Åcial to further study our models and confront them
with measurements of surface nitrogen abundances in magnetic
massive stars (Morel et al. 2008, 2015; Aerts et al. 2014; Martins
et al. 2012, 2015), as well as studies which identiÔ¨Åed anomalous
trends on the Hunter diagram in the LMC and SMC (e.g., Dufton
et al. 2020, and see Section 4.1).

Finally, our current understanding of magnetic Ô¨Åeld evolution
is still incomplete and, in particular, how diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Åeld geome-
tries evolve over time is largely unconstrained. It will therefore be
valuable to explore various Ô¨Åeld evolution scenarios, for example,
magnetic Ô¨Çux decay (Shultz et al. 2019b, Paper III). This might
also lead to a time-dependent magnetic braking scheme depend-
ing on the relative dissipation timescales of various complex Ô¨Åeld
components.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we present the most extensive grid of stellar structure
and evolution models taking into account the eÔ¨Äects of surface fossil
magnetic Ô¨Åelds. The grid is publicly available on Zenodo and we
recommend that, while acknowledging the uncertainties, it could be
used to infer stellar parameters of known magnetic massive stars.
No particular braking (INT/SURF) or mixing (Mix1/Mix2) scheme
can be preferred at this time, although we do assume that if the Ô¨Åeld
geometry is known, the INT case is applicable for dipolar Ô¨Åelds and
the SURF case for more complex geometries. Thus we consider the
four schemes as limiting cases and, as we demonstrate in this work,
the diÔ¨Äerences between these subgrids can substantially impact the
determination of stellar parameters. It is therefore essential to con-
front the Mix1/Mix2 mixing schemes with spectroscopic studies
even for stars where surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds are not detected. In
all cases (2 mixing schemes and 3 metallicities), we provide a sub-
grid of non-magnetic evolutionary models. Furthermore, the grid of
models is suitable for population synthesis studies, which thus far
have neglected magnetic Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects and magnetic massive stars
within stellar populations (however, see Potter et al. 2012b). The
impact of magnetic Ô¨Åelds nonetheless may have important conse-
quences on stellar populations and stellar-end products, for example,
considering progenitors of magnetars (e.g., Schneider et al. 2019).
We demonstrate that magnetic braking by a fossil Ô¨Åeld leads to
eÔ¨Écient spin-down. For example, an initial equatorial Ô¨Åeld of 3 kG
strength at solar metallicity is suÔ¨Écient in most models to decrease
an initial surface equatorial rotational velocity of 300 km s‚àí1 below
50 km s‚àí1 within the early stages of the main sequence evolution
(e.g., Figure 8). For a given magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, the spin-down
of high-mass stars (> 10 M(cid:12)) is further aided by mass-loss, whereas
the spin-down of lower-mass stars in our grid (< 5 M(cid:12)) is identiÔ¨Åable
due to the long nuclear timescale. The intermediate-mass range (5-
10 M(cid:12)) has the least eÔ¨Écient spin-down over the main sequence
evolution.

The "magnetic population" is thus far only identiÔ¨Åed within
the Galaxy by spectropolarimetry and it is unknown what fraction
of massive stars possesses strong, surface magnetic Ô¨Åelds in ex-
tragalactic environments. Generally, the spin-down of the stellar
surface for a given magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is the most rapid at high
metallicity (due to stronger winds), whereas the measurable sur-
face nitrogen abundances are more impacted at lower metallicity
(as chemical mixing eÔ¨Äects are more pronounced). In the Large
Magellanic Cloud, about 20% of stars follow an anomalous pattern
on the Hunter diagram, which can be covered with magnetic stellar
evolution models. We identify the existence of a range of initial

magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths (the exact values depending on metallic-
ity, mixing schemes, etc.) that allow for producing slowly-rotating
nitrogen enriched Group 2 stars. The lower limit is constrained by
a Ô¨Åeld strength that is needed to brake rotation and produce slow
rotators. The upper limit is constrained by a Ô¨Åeld strength that is
needed to allow for rotational mixing and still produce nitrogen en-
richment. The range of possible Ô¨Åeld strengths for the INT models is
much narrower than for the SURF models, however, it is compatible
with typically measured values. In the LMC and SMC almost all
(except some of the lowest mass) models lead to a solution. Con-
trary, we Ô¨Ånd that in the Galaxy the formation of Group 2 stars may
essentially be prevented for initial masses from 6 to 23 M(cid:12) in the
INT/Mix1 scheme (Figure E14).

Overall, we Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerences between the braking
and mixing schemes. With internal magnetic braking caused by a
strong dipolar Ô¨Åeld, diÔ¨Äerential rotation cannot develop. With sur-
face magnetic braking caused by a complex magnetic Ô¨Åeld the phys-
ical scenario remains much less clear; the results strongly depend
on the chosen assumptions regarding chemical mixing.

A full reproduction package is available on Zenodo at https:
//doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7069766, in accordance with the
Research Data Management Plan of the Anton Pannekoek Institute
for Astronomy at the University of Amsterdam.

The data used in this paper amounts to the order of 1/3 TB.
A typical evolutionary model ("history" Ô¨Åle in mesa nomenclature)
is a few MBs, whereas a typical structure model ("proÔ¨Åle" Ô¨Åle
in mesa nomenclature) is 10 MB. Each evolutionary model has
three structure models saved at the ZAMS, mid-MS, and TAMS,
respectively. In addition to the evolutionary and structure Ô¨Åles, we
save and provide the ".mod" Ô¨Åles of each run when available. This
allows for continuing the computations on the post-main sequence.
We also generated isochrones for each sub-grid, these are included
in the Zenodo record.

Given the large range of covered parameter space, the output
data in this paper is particularly useful for stellar evolution and pop-
ulation synthesis studies, as well as to compare with observational
results of even individual stars. However, we emphasise that when
interpreting observational results the modelling assumptions and
uncertainties should be considered.

APPENDIX A: MESA MICROPHYSICS

The MESA EOS is a blend of the OPAL (Rogers & Nayfonov
2002), SCVH (Saumon et al. 1995), FreeEOS (Irwin 2004), HELM
(Timmes & Swesty 2000), PC (Potekhin & Chabrier 2010), and
Skye (Jermyn et al. 2021) EOSes.

Radiative opacities are primarily from OPAL (Iglesias &
Rogers 1993, 1996), with low-temperature data from Ferguson et al.
(2005) and the high-temperature, Compton-scattering dominated
regime by Poutanen (2017). Electron conduction opacities are from
Cassisi et al. (2007).

Nuclear reaction rates are from JINA REACLIB (Cyburt et al.
2010), NACRE (Angulo et al. 1999) and additional tabulated weak
reaction rates; Fuller et al. (1985); Oda et al. (1994); Langanke &
Mart√≠nez-Pinedo (2000). Screening is included via the prescription
of Chugunov et al. (2007). Thermal neutrino loss rates are from Itoh
et al. (1996).

APPENDIX B: MASS-LOSS QUENCHING FOR
QUADRUPOLE FIELD GEOMETRIES

As a simplifying assumption, we consider that even for more com-
plex magnetic Ô¨Åelds (represented by the SURF models), a scaling

Z. Keszthelyi et al.

based on the Alfv√©n radius of a quadrupole Ô¨Åeld may be adopted
to calculate the mass-loss quenching eÔ¨Äect via ùëìB (Equations 7-8).
Here, we outline the actual geometrical eÔ¨Äects of a quadrupolar
magnetic Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åguration.

Following ud-Doula et al. (2008), the escaping wind fraction is
the fraction of the stellar surface covered with open Ô¨Åeld loops. For a
purely dipolar geometry, the region of open Ô¨Åeld loops corresponds
to a polar cap extending from ùúá = 1 to ùúá = ùúáùëö, where ùúá is the cosine
of the co-latitude ùúÉ, and ùúáùëö = cos ùúÉùëö is the location at which the
largest loop connects to the stellar surface (see pink shaded regions
in Fig B1).

This assumes that the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines retain their pure
dipolar geometry, even though in principle the Ô¨Åeld gets distorted
by the outÔ¨Çowing stellar wind. Another approach is to solve for the
magnetic Ô¨Åeld in the magnetosphere using a force-free extrapolation
(e.g. Jardine et al. 1999). Assuming that the magnetic Ô¨Åeld can be ex-
pressed as the gradient of a potential Œ¶ such that ‚àá2Œ¶(ùëü, ùúÉ, ùúë) = 0,
the magnetic Ô¨Åeld can be found by imposing a dipolar (or quadrupo-
lar, see below) boundary condition at the surface and imposing that
the magnetic Ô¨Åeld must become radial at a certain distance from
the stellar surface (at the so-called source radius, ùëüùë†). Following the
description of Gregory (2011) (their Equation 32 with ùëô = 1), in
this case the largest Ô¨Åeld loops (illustrated in the top left panel of
B1 with dashed curves) are connected to the surface at:

sin2 ùúÉùëö =

1
ùëüùëö

3ùëü3
ùëö
1 + 2ùëü3
ùëö

.

(B1)

For a quadrupolar conÔ¨Åguration, open Ô¨Åeld loops are located in two
polar caps (ùúácap) and an equatorial belt (ùúábelt) (see B1 top panels in
blue shading). Thus the total fractional area of open Ô¨Åeld lines is:

ùëìùêµ = [1 ‚àí ùúácap] + [ùúábelt] .
For a purely quadrupolar conÔ¨Åguration, these footpoints of the
largest closed loop can be found by solving for the ùúáùëö roots of:

(B2)

ùúá3
ùëö ‚àí ùúáùëö +

and for a quadrupole extrapolated with a source radius:

(B4)

In general, for the same closure radius the escaping wind frac-
tion (surface covered by open Ô¨Åeld loops) decreases from extrap-
olated dipole ‚Üí pure dipole ‚Üí extrapolated quadrupole ‚Üí pure
quadrupole. We also recall that for a given Ô¨Åeld strength the closure
radius is smaller for a quadrupole Ô¨Åeld than for a dipole. The lower
panels of Fig B1 display the corresponding change in magnetic
mass-loss quenching between the dipolar and quadrupolar geome-
tries as a function of closure radius. In a future work we will imple-
ment and study magnetic mass-loss quenching for Ô¨Åeld geometries
that deviate from a pure dipole. As shown here, we expect that a
quadrupole Ô¨Åeld will result in a lower escaping wind fraction, i.e.,
stronger mass-loss quenching for a given magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength at
a given time. However, the time evolution may sensitively impact
the results in the evolutionary context.

APPENDIX C: CONVECTIVE EXPULSION AND
MAGNETIC SUPPRESSION OF CONVECTIVE LAYERS

"Magneto-convection", the interaction between the magnetic Ô¨Åeld
and turbulent motions in convectively unstable stellar layers, has

been extensively studied and recent progress warrants a brief discus-
sion of this topic. Modifying Schwarzschild‚Äôs criterion for convec-
tion, the stability criterion for magneto-convection was Ô¨Årst given
by Gough & Tayler (1966) and recently revised by MacDonald &
Petit (2019), speciÔ¨Åcally considering radiation pressure to account
for sub-surface layers of massive stars, in the form of:

ùëÑ(‚àá ‚àí ‚àáad) <

ùë£2
ùê¥
ùê¥ + ùëê2
ùë£2
ùë†

(cid:18)

1 +

d ln Œì1
d ln ùëÉ

(cid:19)

,

(C1)

where ùëÑ is the thermal expansion coeÔ¨Écient, ùë£ ùê¥ and ùëêùë† are the
Alfv√©n and sound speeds, Œì1 is the Ô¨Årst adiabatic exponent, and ùëÉ
is the local pressure. This criterion leads to a critical magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strength, which, if reached, suppresses convection (e.g., Lydon &
SoÔ¨Åa 1995; Feiden & Chaboyer 2012), whereas, if it is not reached,
the Ô¨Åeld lines are prevented from reconnecting by strong convective
turbulence, which over time leads to diÔ¨Äusing the magnetic Ô¨Çux
out of those regions (e.g., Parker 1963). In the one-dimensional
stellar evolution models presented in this study, we refrained from
using Equation C1. Both MacDonald & Petit (2019) and Jermyn &
Cantiello (2020) showed that the key (surface) characteristics during
main sequence evolution are not expected to change signiÔ¨Åcantly ‚Äì
when using Equation C1 ‚Äì for the stellar mass domain considered
in this work, except for the 50-60 M(cid:12) models. We anticipate that, in
general, the post-main sequence evolution needs particular attention
due to the structural changes which could lead to the development
of extended convection zones.

The cores of main sequence massive stars are strongly convec-
tive, such that a critical magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, which is needed
to suppress convection (according to the stability criterion given in
Equation C1) may not be reached. In this case, if the magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strength is below its critical strength throughout the core, it is ex-
pected that convection will destroy any large scale, organised mag-
netic Ô¨Çux. This is commonly known as convective expulsion (Parker
1963; Weiss 1966; Spruit 1979; Tao et al. 1998; Sch√ºssler & Kn√∂lker
2001). While the convective core should expel any fossil magnetic
Ô¨Åelds, the development of small-scale magnetic Ô¨Åelds via convec-
tive dynamos (e.g., Stello et al. 2016; Augustson et al. 2016) may
lead to a complex physical picture near the core boundary (Feather-
stone et al. 2009). It is possible that the fossil magnetic Ô¨Åeld has a
strong impact, for example, by suppressing the radiatively unstable
overshooting regions (or even the stellar core, to some extent, see,
e.g., Petermann et al. 2015). Thus far, magneto-asteroseismology
of two magnetic intermediate-mass stars are consistent with a low
value of overshooting (Briquet et al. 2012; Buysschaert et al. 2018).
This gives some support of using a modest overshooting, at least, in
our INT models, where we assume dipoles embedded deep in the
stellar radiative zone. However, this question needs to be studied in
more detail in a future work.

A domain of interest is the sub-surface layer of massive stars
where ineÔ¨Écient convection (accounting for a few percent of the
total luminosity transport) is predicted to arise due to the increase
in the opacity of iron, known as iron opacity bumps (Cantiello et al.
2009; Cantiello & Braithwaite 2011; Gr√§fener et al. 2012). In these
radiation-dominated layers, some excess luminosity is transported
by convective Ô¨Çux. Using equipartition arguments, Auri√®re et al.
(2007) and Sundqvist et al. (2013) argue that sub-surface convec-
tion in radiation-dominated stellar layers can be suppressed by a
critical magnetic Ô¨Åeld when the magnetic pressure reaches the ther-
mal pressure. The exact value of the critical Ô¨Åeld strength needed to
suppress or even inhibit convection remains somewhat uncertain ‚Äì
a problem that is mostly explored for the dynamo Ô¨Åelds of low-mass
stars (Mullan & MacDonald 2001; Feiden & Chaboyer 2012, 2013,

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

The eÔ¨Äects of surface fossil magnetic Ô¨Åelds on massive star evolution: IV.

31

2014; Feiden 2016; MacDonald & Mullan 2017). Nevertheless, ob-
servations clearly show that the Ap phenomenon disappears for
stars less massive than about 1.5 M(cid:12), coinciding with the develop-
ment of eÔ¨Écient convection (due to the hydrogen opacity bump) in
the stellar envelope (Landstreet 1991; Braithwaite & Spruit 2017).
We might therefore assume that extended convective zones cannot
develop in regions of massive stars where the fossil Ô¨Åeld (which
reaches the critical strength) permeates through. A fossil magnetic
Ô¨Åeld, observable at the stellar surface, should certainly reach suf-
Ô¨Åcient critical strength in these near-surface layers to inhibit con-
vection. All OB stars show evidence for measurable macroturbulent
broadening (Sim√≥n-D√≠az et al. 2017), including magnetic OB stars
(Grunhut et al. 2017; Shultz et al. 2018, with the only exception
of NGC 1624-2, see Sundqvist et al. 2013), making them a valu-
able laboratory to further our understanding regarding the origin of
macroturbulence. The observed macroturbulence and the putative
lack of subsurface convection in magnetic OB stars would support
an origin of macroturbulence (at least, in magnetic stars) that is un-
related to sub-surface convection, and could be due to, for example,
wave-propagation from the stellar core (Aerts et al. 2009; Bowman
et al. 2020).

APPENDIX D: ZAMS AND TAMS STELLAR STRUCTURE
MODELS

Here, we describe the stellar structure models of the Ô¨Åducial model
and the corresponding models with initial masses of 20 M(cid:12) in the
other braking and mixing schemes at times close to the ZAMS and
TAMS. In Figure D1 the INT/Mix1 models are shown. Initially,
meridional currents dominate chemical mixing. Given the very ef-
Ô¨Åcient magnetic braking in all layers and the solid-body rotation,
the angular velocity decreases more than an order of magnitude in
all stellar layers from ZAMS to TAMS. Correspondingly, chemical
mixing becomes drastically ineÔ¨Écient, leaving a gap between the
stellar core and the surface. In Figure D2 the INT/Mix2 models are
shown. The results are similar to the INT/Mix1 scheme; however, at
the TAMS the eÔ¨Äective diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient (combining meridional
currents and horizontal turbulence) remains to transport chemical
elements, although with relatively low values (ùê∑ ‚âà 102 cm2s‚àí1) at
the core boundary.

In Figure D3 the SURF/Mix1 models are shown. Similar to the
INT/Mix1 scheme, at the ZAMS meridional circulation is the most
eÔ¨Écient process driving chemical mixing, while the GSF instability
is also present throughout the radiative envelope of the star. At the
TAMS, this instability takes over and becomes the dominant process
for chemical mixing. Unlike in the INT models, the SURF models
show a break in the angular velocity proÔ¨Åle, and correspondingly a
change in the distribution of speciÔ¨Åc angular momentum. The stellar
core has much more angular momentum (close to its initial value)
than in the INT models at the TAMS. In Figure D4 the SURF/Mix2
models are shown. Similarly to the SURF/Mix1 scheme, chemical
mixing is initially dominated by meridional circulation before be-
coming mostly driven by another instability, here by shear mixing.
In this scheme, magnetic braking changes the angular momentum
proÔ¨Åle, and the surface layers have much less angular momentum
than the other models. Consequently, the surface rotation of these
models at the TAMS is very slow, while again the core maintains a
signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of angular momentum. Finally, let us note how
the stellar age systematically increases in the TAMS models from
the INT/Mix1 (8.56 Myr) to SURF/Mix2 (11.98 Myr) schemes as
a consequence of the diÔ¨Äerent braking and mixing assumptions.

APPENDIX E: EVOLUTIONARY MODELS

E1 Fiducial model on the Hunter diagram

In Figure E1, we follow the evolution of our 20 M(cid:12) Ô¨Åducial models
on the Hunter diagram (Hunter et al. 2008, 2009), showing surface
nitrogen abundance against the rotational velocity. The ZAMS is at
the lower right corner of the diagrams with high surface gravities
(colour-coded).

First, we demonstrate how a competition between magnetic
braking and rotational mixing alters the evolutionary tracks (see
also Paper III). The left panel of Figure E1 shows how the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strength results in drastic changes of the model predictions. The
stronger the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, the more rapidly rotation brakes, and
the less nitrogen can be mixed to the stellar surface. Above a given
magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, which strongly depends on other stellar and
mixing parameters, the braking is eÔ¨Écient enough that nitrogen
is not mixed to the surface and the observable nitrogen abundance
remains the initial value throughout the main sequence. For the case
of the 20 M(cid:12) solar-metallicity model with the INT/Mix1 scheme
shown in Figure E1, this threshold occurs roughly at 3 kG.

The right panel of Figure E1 reveals the impact of the initial
metallicity on the evolution of the 20 M(cid:12) INT/Mix1 models in the
Hunter diagram. The initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is
chosen to be 1 kG. Consistently with previous Ô¨Åndings (see Section
3.2.6), we obtain that chemical mixing is easier to trace in lower
metallicity environments where the fractional change between the
initial and Ô¨Ånal abundances are much larger (factor of ‚àº 8 at
SMC metallicity) than at higher metallicity (factor of ‚àº 2 at solar
metallicity) for the same Ô¨Åducial model.

E2 Impact of varying magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength within the

other braking and mixing schemes at solar metallicity

Here, we describe the eÔ¨Äect of varying the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength
for the stellar evolution when accounting for the INT magnetic
braking scheme in combination with the Mix2 chemical mixing
scheme and the SURF magnetic braking scheme in combination
with both the Mix1 and Mix2 chemical mixing schemes at solar
metallicity. We display the evolutionary tracks for these models
with initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths of 0.5 and 3 kG in Figures
E2, E3, and E4. The NOMAG/Mix1 models are shown in Figure
9 and the NOMAG/Mix2 models are shown in Figure E2. This is
complementary to the description in Section 3.2.5 and Figure 9 for
varying the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength when using the INT magnetic
braking scheme and the Mix1 chemical mixing scheme. Below, we
Ô¨Årst describe how the stellar evolution is aÔ¨Äected by accounting
for magnetic Ô¨Åelds for each of the SURF/Mix1, INT/Mix2, and
SURF/Mix2 cases.

E2.1 SURF/Mix1

As described in Section 3.2 and seen from Figure 9, when the
Mix1 rotational mixing scheme is used without including magnetic
Ô¨Åelds, the stars with initial masses < 30 M(cid:12) remain rapidly rotating
(> 200 km s‚àí1) until the end of the main sequence. The nitrogen
abundance increases smoothly (compared to the initial value, see
Table 2) with the initial mass, stretching from log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 = 8.0
up to 8.8. The stars develop mild diÔ¨Äerential rotation as the main
sequence progresses, resulting in cores spinning roughly twice as
fast as their envelopes towards the end of the main sequence.

When treating magnetic Ô¨Åelds using the SURF scheme, angular

momentum is very eÔ¨Éciently transported in the outermost 20% of
the mass. In deeper layers of these models eÔ¨Écient shear mixing
is invoked by diÔ¨Äerential rotation (see Section 3.1). As a result,
mixing is enhanced in magnetic models treated with the SURF
scheme compared to those treated with the INT scheme, which in
contrast are rigidly rotating. Nitrogen is mixed out more eÔ¨Éciently,
reaching surface abundances up to log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 = 8.7 in the
SURF models compared to 8.6 in the INT models of stars with
initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of 0.5 kG. This can be seen
when comparing the middle row of Figure 9 with the top row of
E2. In fact, for stars with initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength
of 0.5 kG in the SURF/Mix1 scheme, the surface enrichment of
nitrogen is very similar throughout the main-sequence as for the
corresponding non-magnetic models. However, the stars spin down
somewhat more when magnetic Ô¨Åelds are implemented.

In the bottom row of Figure E2, models with initial equatorial
magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of 3 kG are displayed. From these models it
is even more evident that the SURF scheme gives rise to slower spin-
down than the INT scheme does (cf. the bottom row of Figure 9).
While some stars still have a considerable rotational velocity at the
end of the main-sequence, magnetic braking is suÔ¨Écient to produce
less enriched stars with nitrogen abundances of log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 =
8.3. When the INT scheme is implemented instead, none of the
models with initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of 3 kG exhibit nitrogen-
enriched surfaces.

E2.2 INT/Mix2

The Mix2 chemical mixing scheme is an eÔ¨Écient rotational mixing
scheme, resulting in quasi-chemically homogeneous main-sequence
evolution when magnetic Ô¨Åelds are not taken into account (see
Section 3.1 and Figure 5). The evolution of the non-magnetic models
is displayed in the upper row of panels of Figures E3. We can see that

non-magnetic stars are expected to experience modest diÔ¨Äerential
rotation (since a high diÔ¨Äusivity, which we attributed to the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld, is not assumed in these models). All of the non-magnetic
models eÔ¨Éciently mix nitrogen out to the surface, reaching values
of log(ùëÅ/ùêª) +12 of 8.8-9.5. All but the most massive stellar models
remain rapidly rotating throughout most of the main sequence, with
surface rotation speeds of ‚àº 200 ‚àí 350 km s‚àí1.

In the middle row of Figure E3, we display models initialised
with 0.5 kG magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths according to the INT scheme.
This magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is suÔ¨Écient to brake the rotation of the
stars, but only after a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of nitrogen has been mixed
out to the surface. As a result, all stars rotate slower than ‚àº 50 km s‚àí1
once the TAMS is reached, and stars with initial masses above
7 ùëÄ(cid:12) have surface nitrogen abundances of log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 ‚àº 8.9.
As visible from the colour-coding in the Kiel diagram, both the
most massive and least massive stars spin down early during the
main-sequence evolution, while the models in the intermediate-
mass range of ‚àº 5‚àí10 M(cid:12) spin down later during the main-sequence
evolution (see Section 3.2.4).

As seen from Figure E3, a modest initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength
of 0.5 kG is suÔ¨Écient to completely alter the evolution in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. If magnetic Ô¨Åelds are not accounted
for, the stars are expected to evolve quasi-chemically homoge-
neously during the entire main sequence, which is not the case
when magnetic Ô¨Åelds are taken into account. In the Kiel diagrams,
the ratios of the core to envelope spins are shown. When magnetic
Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects are accounted for in the INT scheme, the models rotate
rigidly throughout the main sequence (cf. Section 3.2.3).

In the case of models with initial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of 3 kG
(bottom row of Figure E3), magnetic braking is even more eÔ¨Écient
compared to the case of the 0.5 kG models. As a result, rotational
mixing can only act brieÔ¨Çy before the stars have spun down, leading
to slow rotation rates of (cid:46) 50 km s‚àí1 already in the beginning of

the main sequence (for example when log ùëî ‚àº 4.0). The maximum
surface nitrogen abundances reached are also correspondingly low
in comparison to the non-magnetic and weakly magnetic cases,
reaching log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 ‚àº 8.4.

E2.3 SURF/Mix2

Since stars spin down slower when the SURF scheme is used com-
pared to the INT scheme to implement magnetic Ô¨Åelds, the quasi-
chemically homogeneous main sequence evolution that the non-
magnetic models in the Mix2 rotational mixing scheme exhibit is
not as easily quenched by the implementation of magnetic Ô¨Åelds in
the SURF/Mix2 combination. The eÔ¨Äect of the weaker magnetic
braking is evident when comparing Figures E3 and E4.

As a result of the slower spin-down, even stars with initial
magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of 3 kG still substantially enrich their sur-
faces with nitrogen (log(ùëÅ/ùêª) + 12 = 8.7 ‚àí 9.2). They also reach
rotation rates close to zero at the end of the main sequence. As seen
in Figure 5, the combination of SURF and Mix2 results in such ef-
Ô¨Åcient mixing that even the surface helium abundance signiÔ¨Åcantly
increases during the main sequence.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

E3 Impact of varying magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength at ùëç = 0.0064

E3.1 INT/Mix1

At LMC metallicity, the non-magnetic models have several main
diÔ¨Äerences compared to solar metallicity models. First, at lower
metallicity the position of the ZAMS is shifted to higher eÔ¨Äective
temperatures. Second, the relative amount of surface nitrogen en-
richment is much higher. For comparison, the 60 M(cid:12) model in
the Mix1 chemical mixing scheme at solar metallicity produces an
order of magnitude enrichment in its surface nitrogen to hydrogen
ratio over its main sequence evolution, whereas the LMC model
produces almost a factor of 30 (see Figure E5).

With a 0.5 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength within
the INT/Mix1 scheme, the surface equatorial rotational velocity
is reduced in the models due to magnetic braking. This produces
slight diÔ¨Äerences in the evolutionary tracks on the HR and Kiel
diagrams. As a consequence of the reduced rotation in the star,
chemical mixing is also somewhat less eÔ¨Écient compared to the
non-magnetic case.

E3.2 SURF/Mix1

With a 0.5 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength within
the SURF/Mix1 scheme (Figure E6), the overall reduction in sur-
face equatorial rotational velocities is somewhat less than in the

INT/Mix1 case. On the other hand, the most massive models in
this conÔ¨Åguration tend to achieve lower rotational velocities at the
TAMS.

With a stronger, 3 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength,
the numerical simulations show that the position of the models on
HR and Kiel diagram are similar to the non-magnetic and 0.5 kG
cases, except for the most massive stars, which can reach much lower
surface gravities towards the end of their main sequence evolution.
As expected, the evolution of surface equatorial rotational velocities
is also impacted, showing that a spin-down is achieved in all models.

(However, see Section 3.2.4 for the discussion on models in the mass
range of 8-15 M(cid:12).) Consequently, the surface nitrogen enrichment
is more modest compared to the non-magnetic case but still notable
in these models.

E3.3 INT/Mix2

When chemical mixing is assumed in the Mix2 scheme, the non-
magnetic models at LMC metallicity evolve bluewards, quasi-
chemically homogeneously for their entire main sequence evolu-

tion. Within this conÔ¨Åguration the [ùëÅ/ùêª] ratio reaches extremely
high values (Figure E7). This is in part due to the eÔ¨Écient mixing
of nitrogen, and in part due to losing a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of hydro-
gen from the stellar surface via winds. In this case, the low surface
rotational velocities at the TAMS are achieved due to Wolf-Rayet
type mass loss taking away angular momentum from the star.

When a 0.5 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is
considered within the INT/Mix2 scheme the models return to a red-
ward evolution on the main sequence following a rapid blueward
evolution. This is because the spin-down due to magnetic brak-
ing reduces the overall eÔ¨Éciency of chemical mixing and prevents
a quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution for the entire main se-
quence. Note that in this case the TAMS surface rotational velocities
are actually higher than in the non-magnetic case as magnetic brak-
ing weakens over time and stellar winds are less eÔ¨Écient compared
to the non-magnetic case.

With a 3 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength, the main
diÔ¨Äerences result from a stronger magnetic braking. This almost im-
mediately prevents a blueward evolution, producing slowly-rotating
tracks in which the surface nitrogen enrichment is signiÔ¨Åcantly re-
duced compared to the non-magnetic case.

E3.4 SURF/Mix2

In the SURF/Mix2 scheme both set of models with 0.5 and 3 kG
initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength undergo a rapid initial blue-

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

ward evolution as in the INT/Mix2 case (Figure E8). With weaker
initial magnetic Ô¨Åelds, the models above Àú10 M(cid:12) turn to a short
redward evolution before spinning down and reaching their TAMS
again at hotter eÔ¨Äective temperatures. With stronger initial magnetic
Ô¨Åelds, the spin-down leads to preventing the models from turning
back to a blueward evolution by the end of their main sequence.
Similarly to the SURF/Mix1 case, the most massive models with
3 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength may reach low sur-
face gravities. In this conÔ¨Åguration, it is also possible that the most
massive models produce a Ô¨Ånal [ùëÅ/ùêª] ratio that is lower than that
of lower mass models (see also Figure 11). However, given the very
eÔ¨Écient Mix2 scheme, the predicted surface nitrogen enrichment is
still expected to be observable as it is over an order of magnitude
compared to the baseline.

E4 Impact of varying magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength at ùëç = 0.0026

E4.1 INT/Mix1

At SMC metallicity, the ZAMS position of the non-magnetic models
is further shifted to higher eÔ¨Äective temperatures compared to solar
and LMC metallicity models (Figure E9). For the 50 and 60 M(cid:12)
models, we note major diÔ¨Äerences in comparison to models at higher
metallicity. The highest mass non-magnetic models at SMC metal-
licity are able to undergo a blueward evolutionary phase for some
fraction of their main sequence. This results from the relatively

rapid rotation of the models, the eÔ¨Écient core-envelope coupling
(assumed via hydrodynamic processes in a diÔ¨Äusive scheme), and
the eÔ¨Äects of stellar winds. These models can enhance their surface
[ùëÅ/ùêª] ratio by about a factor of 50 compared to the initial baseline
value.

When a 0.5 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is con-
sidered, the eÔ¨Äects of the spin-down are more pronounced than in
higher metallicity models. We see that the blueward evolution of
the most massive models is prevented. The impact on the nitrogen
abundances is also notable as less enrichment is predicted com-
pared to non-magnetic models. However, we should also note that
in contrast to the most massive models in the INT/Mix1 scheme at
higher metallicities, the rotational velocities of these models at SMC
metallicity is actually less impacted. This is because stellar winds
are less eÔ¨Écient at lower metallicity. Thus the combination of mag-
netic braking by a "weak" Ô¨Åeld (initially 0.5 kG) and weaker stellar
winds allows for maintaining higher surface rotational velocities.

E4.2

SURF/Mix1

In the SURF magnetic braking scheme we notice small diÔ¨Äerences
compared to the INT scheme when keeping chemical mixing the
same in the Mix1 scheme (Figure E10). For the same initial mass
the SURF models tend to maintain a somewhat higher rotational
velocity than the INT models. As expected, when increasing the

value of the initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength from 0.5 to
3 kG, the spin-down is stronger, and consequently lower surface
rotational velocities can be reached in conjunction with a reduction
in the surface nitrogen enrichment. Nonetheless, the most massive
models in this conÔ¨Åguration with a 3 kG initial equatorial magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strength are able to produce slowly-spinning, nitrogen-enriched
Group 2 stars.

E4.3 INT/Mix2

In the NOMAG/Mix2 at SMC metallicity, the most extended blue-
ward evolution is produced, reaching 80 kK for the most massive
stellar models (Figure E11). The behaviour of these models is quali-
tatively similar to those of solar and LMC metallicity. The predicted
increase in [ùëÅ/ùêª] is Ô¨Årst a factor of about 50 related to mixing ni-
trogen, and then further almost a factor of 10 related to losing
hydrogen from the stellar surface. Due to the blueward evolution of
the models the surface gravities are expected to remain high.

In the INT/Mix2 case, a 0.5 and 3 kG initial equatorial magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strength can prevent the extensive blueward evolution of the
models. However, in contrast to some previous cases, the most
massive models do not reach low surface gravities. Although for
the non-magnetic case, all models are predicted to show a very
large increase in their surface nitrogen abundance, the magnetic
models show a more moderate enrichment. In this particular setup

Figure E6. Same as Figure E5 but for the SURF/Mix1 scheme. Top panels show models with an initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength of 0.5 kG, whereas
the lower panels show models with 3 kG. The NOMAG/Mix1 model is presented in Figure E5.

we also see that models less massive than initially 6 M(cid:12) tend to
produce much lower [ùëÅ/ùêª] ratios, whereas models with higher
initial masses are closely grouped together.

E4.4 SURF/Mix2

In the SURF/Mix2 scheme at SMC metallicity the 0.5 kG ini-
tial magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength is not quite strong enough to prevent
the quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution of the models (Figure
E12). On the other hand, a 3 kG initial equatorial magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strength leads to a more pronounced redward evolution of the most
massive models after their spin-down. In this case, we again observe
that the most massive models can reach low surface gravities along
with low surface rotational velocities. In all cases, the predicted en-
richment in [ùëÅ/ùêª] remains over an order of magnitude compared
to the baseline.

APPENDIX F: CUTOFF MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH
IN THE SMC AND SOLAR NEIGHBOURHOOD

As in Section 4.2, we can quantify the cutoÔ¨Ä magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths
in other metallicity environments needed to achieve slow-rotating,
nitrogen-enriched stars. First, let us turn our attention to models at
the SMC, shown in Figure E13. The four schemes predict essentially

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì40 (2022)

constant values for ùêµmax,N for masses higher than about 10 M(cid:12).
The INT/Mix1 scheme is the most limiting scenario from the four
schemes. The other schemes predict a wider range of magnetic Ô¨Åeld
strengths that allow for producing Group 2 stars. Since nitrogen
abundances and rotation rates are measurable in the SMC, the iden-
tiÔ¨Åed Group 2 stars (Dufton et al. 2020) could be explained with
a limited range of magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths. Typically, the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld strength decreases roughly by an order of magnitude on the
main sequence (cf. Equation 2). Thus depending on the age and
evolutionary state of observed Group 2 stars, their observable Ô¨Åelds
will be weaker than the ZAMS Ô¨Åeld strengths. A sort of minimum
range of their putative magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength could evolve from the
range of initially 250 G to 7.5 kG (equatorial strength) at the ZAMS
to 25 G to 750 G at the TAMS if the INT/Mix1 scheme is con-
sidered. For massive star models, the SURF/Mix1 and SURF/Mix2
schemes allow for an upper limit of initially 50 kG, which we expect
to weaken to a 5 kG equatorial Ô¨Åeld strength by the TAMS.

Figure E14 shows models with an initial metallicity of
ùëç = 0.014 (representative of the Solar neighbourhood). Consis-
tently with previous Ô¨Åndings, the INT/Mix1 is the most restrictive
to produce Group 2 stars. In fact, in this case there are more forbid-
den regions than in models with lower metallicities. For example, the
INT/Mix1 scheme essentially does not allow for producing Group 2
stars in the 6 - 23 M(cid:12) range. In contrast, the SURF/Mix2 scheme al-
lows for strong magnetic Ô¨Åelds to brake the rotation and still produce

nitrogen excess at the surface. Since high-resolution spectropolari-
metric observations in the Galaxy have allowed for measuring the
magnetic Ô¨Åeld strengths of massive stars, these model predictions
allow for more direct comparison with observations than in the
Magellanic Clouds. While the nitrogen abundance and (projected)
rotational velocity are also measurable, a comprehensive study still
needs to assess these three quantities jointly in comparison to mag-
netic stellar evolution models (however, see Morel et al. 2008; Mar-
tins et al. 2012, 2015; Aerts et al. 2014). Our single-star models
provide testable predictions for these parameters, and such an in-

vestigation could help disentangle between the uncertain braking
and mixing schemes. In particular, nitrogen-enriched slow rotators
with strong magnetic Ô¨Åelds favour eÔ¨Écient mixing.
