Background: Higher endogenous testosterone levels are associated with reduced chronic 
disease risk and mortality. Since the mid-20th century, there have been significant changes in 
dietary patterns, and men’s testosterone levels have declined in western countries. Cross-
sectional studies show inconsistent associations between fat intake and testosterone in men.  

Methods: Studies eligible for inclusion were intervention studies, with minimal confounding 
variables, comparing the effect of low-fat vs high-fat diets on men’s sex hormones. 9 databases 
were searched from their inception to October 2020, yielding 6 eligible studies, with a total of 
206 participants. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane’s Review 
Manager software. Cochrane’s risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment.  

Results: There were significant decreases in sex hormones on low-fat vs high-fat diets. 
Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes were: total 
testosterone [-0.38 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.01) P = 0.04]; free testosterone [-0.37 (95% CI -0.63 to  
-0.11) P = 0.005]; urinary testosterone [-0.38 (CI 95% -0.66 to -0.09) P = 0.009]; and 
dihydrotestosterone [-0.3 (CI 95% -0.56 to -0.03) P = 0.03]. There were no significant differences 
for luteinising hormone or sex hormone binding globulin. Subgroup analysis for total 
testosterone, European and North American men, showed a stronger effect [-0.52 (95% CI -0.75 
to -0.3) P < 0.001].  

Conclusions: Low-fat diets appear to decrease testosterone levels in men, but further 
randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this effect. Men with European ancestry may 
experience a greater decrease in testosterone, in response to a low-fat diet.

1. Introduction 

Testosterone (T) plays a fundamental role in male physiology and reproductive health. Low 
endogenous T levels are associated with a higher risk of chronic disease [1–3]; and all-cause 
mortality [4]. Several studies in western and other modernised countries have found an age-
independent secular decline in men’s serum total testosterone (TT) of approximately 1% per 
year, beginning in the 1970s [5–12]. This downwards secular trend in T is only partly explained 
by the concurrent rise in BMI over the late 20th century [5,6]. The other factors responsible for 
this trend remain to be elucidated. 

Western dietary patterns have changed substantially over the 20th century, with processed food 
consumption more than doubling in western countries [13,14]. The trend towards increased 
processed food and decreased whole food consumption, has contributed to a change in 
macronutrient intakes since the mid-20th century. In the USA, from 1965–71 fat intake 
decreased by 235kcal/day, and from 1965-91 carbohydrate intake increased by 263kcal/day 
[15]. These changes resulted in a 10.1% decrease in fat intake, as a percentage of total energy 
intake (TEI). From 1991-2011, macronutrient intakes remained relatively stable [15]. The 
decrease in fat intake was largely a response to dietary guidelines advising a reduction in fat 
intake, starting in the 1960s [15–17]. In the USA, the first evidence of a secular decline in T is 
from the 1980s [5], which is at the tail end of the changes in macronutrient intakes. This 
prompts the question of whether changes in fat intake may affect T levels.  

Cross-sectional studies on the association between fat intake and T have produced conflicting 
results [18–22], possibly due to unmeasured confounding variables. However, the largest of 
these studies found that men adhering to a low-fat (LF) vs non-restricted diet had significantly 
lower serum TT (-32.7 ng/dL) [18]. General reviews on diet and sex hormones have only briefly 
covered the topic of dietary fat and T [23–26]. Moreover, these reviews have not included meta-
analysis of homogeneous studies, have included studies with significant confounding variables, 
and missed eligible studies. Therefore, to investigate whether the association between LF diets 
and TT is causal, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on intervention studies 
comparing the effect of a LF vs high-fat (HF) diet on men’s TT and related hormonal markers.

2. Methods 

The review was structured using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses) 2009 checklist [27]. The review protocol was retrospectively registered with 
Research Registry, the unique identifying number is reviewregistry1085 [28]. The Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used as a guide throughout the review 
process [29]. 

2.1. Eligibility criteria 

Studies were eligible if they met all of the following criteria: 

1.  Measurement of either TT, free testosterone (FT), urinary testosterone (UT), 

dihydrotestosterone (DHT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), or luteinising 
hormone (LH). 

2.  Healthy adult male participants only (18+ years); to minimise participant variation in 

3. 

androgen metabolism due to disease or biological maturity.  
Intervention at least 1 week, as the acute effects of food intake on androgen 
metabolism, may not reflect the long-term effects [30]. 

4.  A difference in fat intake between diets ≥10% of TEI, to provide a meaningful distinction 
between diets on the basis of fat intake. Percentage rather than total fat intake was 
used to account for participant differences in energy intake requirements. 
5.  No factors which may alter androgen metabolism such as exogenous hormones, 

medications [31], dietary supplements [32,33], phytoestrogens [34], changes in exercise 
levels [35], protein >20% of TEI [36], carbohydrate <15% of TEI [37], weight loss >2kg 
[38], and a difference in TEI between diets ≥10% [38,39]. 

Studies which stated diets were isocaloric, but did not report precise TEIs were eligible. 
Hypogonadal participants were eligible, being a population of special interest, however no 
eligible studies contained them.  

2.2. Search strategy 

The following databases were searched from conception to 10th October 2020: MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, 
ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Open Grey, and Google Scholar. 
Where possible the following search filters were applied: human, adult (18+ or 19+ years), male, 
intervention studies, and completed/ with results; no restrictions were put on language. A broad 
search was conducted on all databases except Google Scholar, using the search terms: 
(hypogonadism OR testosterone OR luteini* OR sex hormone* OR androgen*) AND (diet OR 
dietary OR macronutrient*). This was complimented by a precise search on Google Scholar 
limited to the first 200 results [40], using the search terms: men diet hypogonadism OR 
testosterone OR androgen OR hormones -mice -rats -cats -dogs -animals -mouse. Google Scholar 
was included as its addition to a MEDLINE and EMBASE search has been shown to increase 
overall recall by 3.1% [40]. However, since search filters were used a non-MEDLINE PubMed 
search could not be conducted, as non-MEDLINE results are not filterable [41].

The initial database search and screen was done by 1 author (J. W.), which yielded 2594 results 
(Fig. 1). 4 related reviews were found [23–26], and their references lists were searched 
manually. References lists of any eligible studies were also searched manually. 28 records were 
selected for full text review, 26 of which were derived from the initial search and 2 from 
reference lists. Both authors independently assessed each full text article for eligibility, which 
produced identical eligible studies. 6 studies were selected for inclusion in the systematic review 
and meta-analysis, which were reported over 12 articles.

2.3. Data extraction 

1 author (J. W.) extracted the following data from each study: total sample size; sample size for 
each outcome; mean age; length of intervention; calorie and fat intake; bodyweight; outcomes 
for each diet with standard error of the mean (SEM), standard deviation (SD) or confidence 
intervals (CI); and P value for mean changes. The outcomes were TT, FT, UT, DHT, SHBG, and LH. 
Where data was presented only in graphs and the original authors could not provide it, the data 
was digitally extracted using the tool: Web Plot Digitizer [42]. All extracted data was triple 
checked against the original studies. Where possible and appropriate the studies’ authors were 
contacted for additional information. 

2.4. Data syntheses 

When studies reported multiple outcome measurements from the same day, a mean and 
combined SD of these was used. Subgroups within studies were combined, and SEM and CIs 
were converted into SDs. To do this, formulas from the Cochrane handbook were used [43]. Hill 
1980 featured 2 different interventions and samples respectively, North American (NA) hospital 
staff and rural South African (SA) farmers [44]. The study was split into 2 groups for analysis, as 
these 2 study arms could not be fairly combined. This meant there were 7 total samples for 
meta-analysis, from the 6 original studies. Additional details on how each study was handled can 
be found in Appendix A: Supplemental Methods.   

2.5. Meta-analyses 

All studies accounted for the diurnal rhythms of sex hormones, by ensuring the time of the 
blood sample was the same for each study condition. 2 studies used serum measurements 
[45,46], and 4 studies used plasma measurements [44,47–49], with different hormonal assays 
used across the studies. Therefore, to minimise differences due to blood samples and assays, 
standardised mean differences with 95% CIs were used for all outcomes. All of the studies were 
crossover trials, but did not show any significant period or carry-over effects. Therefore, the 
outcomes for HF and LF diets (mean ± SD) were used as the basis for the pooled effect 
estimates. The variance of within participant differences was not used for pooled effect 
estimates, as this would have required variance to be calculated based on assumptions for the 
majority of studies [50]. The meta-analyses were done using Cochrane’s software: Review 
Manager [51]. DerSimonian and Laird’s random effects model was used for all outcomes [52]. 
Chi-squared (Chi2) and I2 tests were used to measure heterogeneity, however since these tests 
were underpowered due to the low number of studies, forest plots were also visually inspected 
for heterogeneity. I2 = 0 - 30% was not taken as conclusive evidence of low heterogeneity, but 
was interpreted alongside P values from Chi2 tests and the visual inspection of forest plots. As a 
rule of thumb, P < 0.05 for Z tests were used as an indication of statistical significance, not an 
absolute measure of it, as suggested by Cochrane [53]. Standardised mean differences were 
interpreted as follows: 0.2 = small effect, 0.5 = moderate effect, and 0.8 = large effect [54].   

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses 

A post hoc subgroup analysis was done for TT western samples, as the only non-western sample 
[44], showed significant qualitative interaction. Western samples were defined as samples from 
North America or Europe. This yielded a reasonably ethnically homogeneous subgroup 
approximately 87.3% white/ European descent and 12.7% black NA. Afterwards, a sensitivity 
analysis was conducted for TT, by taking out each study in turn and running the meta-analysis 
again. These results were informally compared to each other, as suggested by Cochrane [55].  

An additional post hoc sensitivity analysis was done for TT, excluding the 2 most clinically 
diverse and highest risk of bias studies: Reed 1987 and Hill 1979 [47,49]. These studies had 
notably smaller sample sizes, and the LF diet in Reed 1987 had the lowest fat intake of all study 
diets by a margin of 7.1% of TEI [47] (Table 1). There was also limited data on participant age in 
Hill 1979 [49] (Table 1). No other subgroup or sensitivity analyses were done, for risk of data 
dredging the small sample of studies. 

2.7. Quality assessment 

Since all of the studies were crossover trials, Cochrane’s risk of bias crossover variant tool was 
used [56]. 5 of the 6 studies were not randomised [44–47,49]; therefore the randomisation bias 
questions were omitted for these studies. An additional bias domain was added to the Cochrane 
tool for the confounding variable of differences in micronutrient intake between HF and LF 
diets. Before undertaking meta-analyses, both authors independently conducted the risk of bias 
assessment, and differences were settled by discussion. Afterwards, a risk of bias graph was 
generated using Cochrane’s software: Risk of Bias Visualisation [57]. In this graph, studies were 
weighted using their weights from the TT meta-analysis. Forest plots were ordered from lowest 
to highest risk of bias.

3.1. Characteristics of included studies 

The studies had a total of 206 participants, with a mean age of 46 years, and intervention diets 
ranged from 2 - 10 weeks (Table 1). The weighted mean difference in fat intake for LF vs HF diets 
was 20.1% of TEI (LF = 19.5, HF = 39.6), or 580kcal (LF = 547, HF = 1127). 3 studies directly 
measured and reported TEI [45,46,48], the weighted mean difference for LF vs HF diets was -49 
kcal/day (LF = 2877, HF = 2926). 4 studies reported bodyweight [44–46,48], the weighted mean 
change in bodyweight during the dietary interventions was -0.8kg. 

3.2. Meta-analyses 

All results are presented in standardised mean differences with 95% CIs.

vs high-fat (HF) diets. 
_____________ 

There was a small to moderate decrease in TT on LF vs HF diets, which was just statistically 
significant [-0.38 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.01), P = 0.04] (Fig. 2). There was considerable heterogeneity 
in the results (I2 = 67%, Chi2 = 18.25, P = 0.006).

Compared to TT all samples, the subgroup TT western samples showed a larger decrease in TT 
on LF vs HF diets [-0.52 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.30) P < 0.001] (Fig. 3). There was also reduced 
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 4.71, P = 0.45), due to the exclusion of Hill 1980 SA, the only 
sample to show a significant increase in TT on a LF diet [44].

_____________ 

There was a small to moderate, statistically significant decrease in FT on LF vs HF diets [-0.37 
(95% CI -0.63 to -0.11) P = 0.005] (Fig. 4). Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 1.03,  
P = 0.79). Visually, there was slight heterogeneity in the results, although the direction of effects 
was consistent.

(I2 = 34%, Chi2 = 4.54, P = 0.21), although the direction of effects was consistent.

P = 0.16] (Fig. 6). Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 3.99, P = 0.55), however a 
visual survey of the results revealed moderate heterogeneity and a somewhat inconsistent 
direction of effects.

heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 2.20, P = 0.53). Reed 1987 showed qualitive interaction 
[47], but was an imprecise study, meaning it had low weight in the meta-analysis.

_____________ 

The sensitivity analyses excluding 1 study at a time, all produced similar results except for the 
analysis minus Hill 1980 SA [44] (Table 2). Excluding this analysis, standardised mean differences 
were from -0.29 to -0.42, P values were 0.04 - 0.13, and I2 tests were 66 - 73%. This indicates the 
results for the TT meta-analysis were not unduly reliant on any single study. The sensitivity 
analyses also confirm the source of the considerable heterogeneity in the TT meta-analysis was 
Hill 1980 SA [44]. The last sensitivity analysis which excluded the 2 most clinically diverse studies 
[47,49], produced similar results to all other combinations of studies, besides the analysis minus 
Hill 1980 SA [44]. This indicates clinical heterogeneity did not have a significant effect on the TT 
meta-analysis.

_____________ 

3 studies were at low risk of bias [45,46,48], and 3 studies were at medium risk of bias 
[44,47,49] (Table 1). In Reed 1987 and Hill 1979, unmeasured changes in calorie intake may have 
altered the effect of LF diets on outcomes, although these studies stated that the intervention 
diets were isocaloric [47,49] (Fig. 9 - performance bias and carry-over effects). Hill 1980 NA and 
SA may have lacked full outcome data for all participants, nevertheless all outcome data 
reported showed a consistent pattern of effects [44,61–63] (Fig. 9 - attrition bias and incomplete 
outcome data). The forest plots were ordered from lowest to highest risk of bias, which revealed 
a visual trend of smaller more consistent effects in low-bias studies, and larger more 
inconsistent effects in medium-bias studies. This was particularly evident in the forest plots for 
TT, FT and SHBG (Figs. 2, 4, and 7).

4. Discussion 

The main findings of this review were that LF vs HF diets resulted in small to moderate 
decreases in TT, FT, UT, and DHT in men (Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 8). There was a small decrease in 
bodyweight during the dietary interventions (-0.8kg), which is unlikely to have significantly 
affected outcomes. Most of the studies used a HF/LF diet order, with the HF period mimicking 
the participants’ baseline diet. The most notable exception to this was Hill 1980 SA which used a 
LF/HF diet order and was the only study to find a significant increase in TT on a LF diet [44] (Fig. 
2). Thus, it could be argued that any dietary change, regardless of macronutrient composition 
results in a decrease in androgens. However, in Hill 1980 SA UT substantially increased on the HF 
diet which does not indicate lowered androgen status [62] (Fig. 5). Also, Dorgan 1996 used a 2-
group crossover design (AB/BA), and found diet order made no difference to changes in 
outcomes [48]. Similarly, both Hämäläinen 1984 and Wang 2005 included a 3rd HF switchback 
diet, and found no effect of diet order on outcomes [45,46]. 

4.1. Mechanisms: main findings 

The results for TT showed a high degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 67%) (Fig. 2), which was 
decreased in the subgroup TT western (I2 = 0%) (Fig. 3). This suggests ethnic and genetic or 
epigenetic variation in TT, in response to dietary fat intake. The remaining visual heterogeneity 
in TT western may be attributable to a variety of factors, one of which being differences in 
micronutrient intake (Fig. 9). The largest decreases in TT were seen in the 2 studies with 
vegetarian LF diets (Hill 1979; Hill 1980 NA) [44,49]. These diets may have been lower in zinc, 
which is a common feature of vegetarian diets [64], and marginal zinc deficiency has been found 
to decrease TT [32]. Nevertheless, studies well matched for micronutrient intake showed 
similar, albeit smaller changes in TT [45,48] (Fig. 2); suggesting the decrease in TT was mostly 
due to other dietary factors.  

Dietary fibre intake was likely higher on LF vs HF diets, which has been suggested to increase T 
excretion by modulating the enterohepatic circulation of steroids [25]. However, we found LH (P 
= 0.16) and UT excretion (P = 0.009) decreased on LF diets, which suggests decreased T 
production rather than increased T excretion (Figs. 5 and 6). Moreover, using a 12hr 
trideuterated infusion of T, Wang 2005 found no change in T excretion on the LF diet, but 
decreased T production [46]. 2 studies measured follicle-stimulating hormone, which showed 
inconsistent effects on LF diets [46,61]. Estradiol was measured in 4 and estrone in 2 studies, via 
blood sampling [44–46,48,61]. The results showed either non-significant changes (mostly 
decreases), or significant decreases on LF diets. This suggests an upregulation of aromatase, 
leading to increased estrogens was not responsible for the lower T on LF diets. In meta-analysis, 
DHT significantly decreased on the LF diets, which indicates decreased T production, rather than 
an inhibition of 5α-reductase leading to a build-up of T (Fig. 8). We found weak evidence of a 
small decrease of SHBG on LF diets (Fig. 7). This suggests the decrease in FT on LF diets was 
largely due to lower TT, rather than higher SHBG bound T. To summarise, our findings indicate 
that endogenous T production decreased on LF diets, leading to lower FT and TT.   

The HF diets had increased dietary cholesterol and caused increased blood cholesterol. Since, T 
is synthesised from cholesterol it is logical to think that increased cholesterol substrate, 

14 

 
 
 
increased T production. However, in men hypercholesterolemia is associated with lower TT [65]; 
and in rodents high cholesterol diets decrease TT by downregulating steroidogenic enzymes 
[66]. Similarly, the HF vs LF diets likely had higher dietary arachidonic acid, due to higher intakes 
of animal foods. In vitro, exogenous arachidonic acid has been shown to increase T production 
in Leydig cells [67]; however arachidonic acid supplementation in men has not been found to 
affect TT or FT [68].   

The LF vs HF diets were consistently lower in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and 
saturated fatty acids (SFA), and had higher polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios (P:S). 
This suggests a beneficial effect of MUFA and SFA, and/or a deleterious effect of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on androgens. A similar but ineligible study found that 
decreasing MUFA and SFA, and increasing P:S whilst keeping total fat intake stable, decreased 
TT by 15% [69]. The beneficial effect of MUFA intake on T is supported by another study which 
replaced 25g/day butter with either olive or argan oil, and found TT increased by 17.4% and 
19.9% respectively (P < 0.001) [70]. In rodents, fatty acid intake strongly modifies testicular lipid 
composition. High PUFA vs MUFA or SFA diets result in decreased T production via increased 
testicular oxidative stress, decreased steroidogenic enzymes and decreased testicular free 
cholesterol available for steroidogenesis [71,72]. For ethical reasons, similar experiments have 
not been conducted in humans. However, intervention and cross-sectional studies have found 
that blood and adipose lipids similarly reflect dietary intake, with stronger effects for PUFA [73]. 
High intakes of linoleic acid, the main dietary omega-6 PUFA, have been shown to increase 
markers of oxidative stress in men [74]. Oxidative stress is well known to adversely affect semen 
parameters [75]; and this effect may extend to testicular steroidogenesis. Omega-6 intake has 
been inversely correlated to testicular volume, suggesting a direct adverse effect on testicular 
function [22]. Thus, the decrease in MUFA and SFA intake, and relative increase in omega-6 
PUFA on LF diets, may have altered testicular lipid composition and increased oxidative stress, 
thereby decreasing T production. 

4.2. Mechanisms: subgroups 

Androgen metabolism likely differs by ethnicity, as ethnic differences have been found in men’s 
FT, SHBG and follicle-stimulating hormone levels [76,77]. Whether androgen metabolism differs 
by ethnicity in response to diet has not been well studied. However, the limited results from our 
subgroup analysis suggests that the decrease in TT on LF diets is larger and more consistent in 
western vs non-western men (Figs. 2 and 3). Palaeolithic ancestors of modern Europeans likely 
had a HF intake, as reliance on animal foods in 20th century hunter gatherers increases ≥40° 
latitude, putting almost all of Europe in this category [78]. In addition, modern Europeans have a 
high prevalence of the -13,910 C>T allele which gives rise to the phenotype of lactase 
persistence, and confers the ability to digest lactose throughout adulthood [79]. This suggests 
that after the Neolithic revolution Europeans continued to enjoy HF intakes, by consuming 
traditional HF dairy foods [80]. Since genetic adaptations to environmental changes occur 
slowly, the majority of human genes remain unchanged since the upper Palaeolithic and early 
Neolithic periods [81]. Thus, men with European ancestry may have other genetic adaptations 
that promote a survival or reproductive advantage in response to a HF diet. Therefore, we 
hypothesize that T levels are adversely affected by a LF diet in men of European descent. 

15 

 
 
 
4.3. Secular decline in testosterone  

In the USA, from 1965-91 fat intake decreased by 10.1% of TEI [15], and the first evidence of a 
secular decline in T follows this [5]. The decline in fat intake largely came from decreases in SFA 
and MUFA, whilst PUFA intake remained relatively stable [82]. The change in fat intake from 
1965-91, is comparable to the mean difference between the HF vs LF diets of this review, 
although decreases in fat intake were larger in the reviewed studies (10.1 vs 20.1% of TEI). The 
results of this review suggest that the decline in fat intake over the 1970s and 80s, may have 
adversely affected men’s TT and FT. However, since fat intake had stabilised by 1991 [15], it is 
unlikely to explain the continual secular decline in T. To our knowledge, it is unknown whether 
LF diets have a larger or smaller effect in the long term, due to a lack of longitudinal studies 
measuring fat intake and T. 

4.4. Limitations 

The main limitation of the review was the low number of studies and small total sample size (n = 
206). This contributed to the somewhat larger CIs and P values than expected for reasonably 
homogeneous studies. Additionally, we did not use the variance of within participant differences 
for the pooled effect estimates; thus it is possible that the effect estimates had slightly larger CIs 
than true [50]. In contrast, our method for the variance of effects was more conservative [50], 
and so increased the confidence in our results. It also avoided possibly inaccurate changes in the 
weighting of studies in the meta-analyses. A separate issue was that the DerSimonian and Laird 
method [52] arguably performs poorly with a low number of studies [83], which meant our 
heterogeneity tests were unpowered and CIs possibly too narrow. However, since statistical 
heterogeneity was low, besides TT, and there was no clear-cut alternative method [84], we 
chose to use the conventional DerSimonian and Laird approach [52]. To alleviate these 
problems, we visually inspected forest plots to detect additional heterogeneity. The low number 
of studies also meant that we were unable to produce a meaningful funnel plot to investigate 
publication bias. 

We attempted to explain the considerable heterogeneity in TT by doing a post hoc subgroup 
analysis based on ethnicity (Fig. 3). However, the subgroup western included a small number of 
NA black men (12.7%), meaning it did not uniformly represent men of white/ European descent, 
although they were the majority (87.3%). Also, it is possible that the study excluded in the 
subgroup analysis [44], was an outlier for another reason such as some facet of study design or 
chance. Subgroup analyses are observational in nature, particularly when done post hoc, so this 
process cannot produce firm conclusions and is best used to produce hypotheses [55]. A 
strength of the subgroup analysis is that it relied upon within study differences in effects, rather 
than between study differences. Also, it was based on qualitive interaction rather than a 
difference in magnitude of effect. The low number of studies made statistical and qualitative 
explanations of heterogeneity hard to distinguish from chance, particularly in outcomes with 
less than 7 samples. Additional sources of heterogeneity including differences in micronutrient 
and fatty acid intake could not be robustly explored, due to a lack of study data and the low 
number of studies. 

16 

 
 
 
 
Another limitation was that half of the studies included were at medium risk of bias (Table 1 and 
Fig. 9). In addition, only 1 study was a fully randomised (AB/BA) crossover trial [48], which 
increased the risk of selection and performance bias, particularly at the review level (Fig. 9). 
Across outcomes, the low vs medium-bias studies showed smaller more consistent effects. This 
was most evident in DHT which included only the 3 low-bias studies [45,46,48], and showed very 
little heterogeneity visually or statistically (I2 = 0%; Chi2 = 0.11, P = 0.94) (Fig. 8). A strength of 
the review was that the strict eligibility criteria provided studies relatively free from 
confounding variables, and the extensive search strategy likely captured all eligible studies.  

Throughout the review, the primary measurement of fat intake used was relative intake, 
measured as a percentage of TEI. Since only weight-maintaining isocaloric dietary interventions 
were included, percentage fat intake provided a measure of absolute fat intake, which 
accounted for participant differences in energy intake requirements. However, this approach 
meant we were unable to detect the effects of absolute fat intake on outcomes, irrespective of 
participant energy requirements. An alternative approach would have been to conduct a 
correlation-based analysis using absolute fat intake vs outcomes for each individual diet (or 
participant). However, due to the differences in assays and plasma vs serum measurements, this 
was not appropriate for the included studies. Also, this analysis would have ignored the relative 
within-study effects on outcomes. A full discussion of the merits of using absolute, rather than 
relative fat intake is beyond the scope of this review.   

5. Conclusions 

The results of this review suggest that LF vs HF diets moderately decrease T levels in men, via a 
reduction in testicular T production. However, due to the small total sample size (n = 206), 
heterogeneity in TT (Fig. 2), and risk of bias (Fig. 9); large randomised controlled trials are 
needed to confirm this review’s findings, before practical recommendations can be made. 
Ideally, such studies would also investigate the effects of ethnicity on androgen metabolism, in 
response to dietary fat intake.
