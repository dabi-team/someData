ABSTRACT
We present the results of our orbital computations in support of the recently proposed contact-binary
model for the Kreutz sungrazer system (Sekanina 2021, 2022). We demonstrate that comet Ikeya-Seki
(C/1965 S1) previously passed perihelion decades after the Great Comet of 1106 (X/1106 C1) and
argue that, like the Great September Comet of 1882 (C/1882 R1), it evidently was a fragment of the
comet recorded by the Chinese in September 1138. The 1106 sungrazer appears instead to have
been the previous appearance of the Great March Comet of 1843 (C/1843 D1). With no momentum
exchange involved, fragments of a Kreutz sungrazer breaking up tidally near perihelion are shown to
end up in orbits with markedly diﬀerent periods because their centers of mass are radially shifted by a
few kilometers relative to the parent. The daylight comets of AD 363, recorded by a Roman historian,
are accommodated in our computations as the ﬁrst appearance of the Kreutz sungrazers after their
bilobed progenitor’s breakup. We link the 1843–1106–363 (Lobe I) and 1882–1138–363 (Lobe II)
returns to perihelion by single nongravitational orbits and gravitationally with minor center-of-mass
shifts acquired in fragmentation events. We also successfully model the motion of Aristotle’s comet
as the rotating progenitor that at aphelion split (at a few m s−1) into the two lobes, the precursors
of, respectively, the 1843 and 1882 sungrazers; and provide a 1963–1041–363 link for comet Pereyra
(C/1963 R1). Material fatigue could contribute to sungrazers’ fragmentation throughout the orbit,
including aphelion. — Continuing problems with the nongravitational law in orbit software are noted.

1. INTRODUCTION
Among the Kreutz sungrazers seen in the past 200
years, two objects have stood out as by far the intrin-
sically brightest and presumably the most massive: the
Great March Comet of 1843 (C/1843 D1) and the Great
September Comet of 1882 (C/1882 R1). Moving about
the Sun in somewhat diﬀerent orbits (though sharing
a common line of apsides), they are the quintessential
members of two fundamental subgroups or populations,
I and II, respectively. Their possible history was de-
scribed more than 50 years ago by Marsden (1967). Al-
though the number of known populations has gradually
been growing (e.g., Marsden 1989), Populations I and II
have remained. Bright Kreutz sungrazers have repeat-
edly been observed to fragment or disintegrate at perihe-
lion, but the existence of the distinct populations cannot
be explained by perihelion breakups, unless unrealisti-
cally long periods of time are invoked.

While the populations are in principle understood as
products of cascading fragmentation at all heliocentric
distances, with the primary breakup in the general prox-
imity of aphelion (Sekanina 2002; Sekanina & Chodas
2004, 2007), a meaningful modeling of the Kreutz sys-
tem’s evolution requires at least limited knowledge of
the history of its members. Given that the typical or-
bital periods of the Kreutz comets exceed 700 yr, the
parent objects of the 19th to 21th century sungrazers
are necessarily historical comets, for which little, if any,
information is available.

2. PAST WORK RELATED TO THE COMET OF 1106
The Great Comet of 1106 (X/1106 C1), long suspected
from historical records to have been a sungrazer (e.g.,
Pingr´e 1783, Hall 1883, Kreutz 1888, 1901), should con-
stitute an integral part of any evolutionary investiga-
tion of the Kreutz system. Although limited data are
available on the comet’s tail, no orbit could be com-
puted. Granted it indeed was a Kreutz comet, the issue
of whether it was a previous appearance of the Great
March Comet of 1843 (of Population I) or the Great
September Comet of 1882 (of Population II) has long
been a point of contention.

A pivotal role in eﬀorts to settle this issue has in
fact been played by another sungrazer, comet Ikeya-Seki
(C/1965 S1), whose orbit in many respects resembles
that of the 1882 comet so closely that it has served as
an indispensable proxy because of its much higher accu-
racy. Perihelion fragmentation and the resulting post-
perihelion nucleus multiplicity complicate matters in ei-
ther case, but comet Ikeya-Seki was observed after peri-
helion to possess two persisting fragments, while the 1882
sungrazer displayed up to six.
Integrating the orbit of
the primary nucleus of Ikeya-Seki back in time, Marsden
(1967) established that it would have previously been at
perihelion in March 1115 or September 1116 depending
on whether the relativistic eﬀect was or was not included.
His integration of Kreutz’s (1891) nonrelativistic orbit for
the primary nucleus (No. 2 in Kreutz’s notation) of the
1882 comet gave the previous perihelion in April 1138.
Marsden concluded that the Great Comet of 1106 “seems
by far the most promising candidate for the previous ap-

pearance of comet [Ikeya-Seki]” and that it was “virtually
proven that [the 1882 comet and Ikeya-Seki] were indeed
one at their previous approach to the Sun.”

While evidence for the second conclusion is strong, the
ﬁrst is questionable because of as yet unresolved issues
in the orbital motions of the 1882 comet and Ikeya-Seki.
While for the ﬁrst comet we have nothing to add to
Kreutz’s (1891) results, we develop a novel technique to
apply to the orbit of comet Ikeya-Seki in order to settle
the question of whether or not the 1106 comet was this
sungrazer’s previous appearance.

The “best-determined” orbit of each nucleus fragment
of the Great September Comet of 1882 or comet Ikeya-
Seki was computed (by Kreutz or by Marsden) by linking
the comet’s pre-fragmentation astrometric positions be-
fore perihelion with that fragment’s positions after per-
ihelion. On the one hand, such an orbital solution is —
to say the least — problematic because it smoothes the
motion prior to and after the point of dynamical discon-
tinuity associated with the splitting — the very eﬀect of
interest. On the other hand, the options of overcoming
the discontinuity problem are in practice very limited
because separate preperihelion and post-perihelion or-
bital arcs are inadequate to serve as a basis for accurate
orbital-period determination.

Although subject to occasional criticism, Marsden’s
(1967, 1989) preference for the 1106 comet as the par-
ent to the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki’s comet (rather
than to the 1843 comet) was incorporated into the two-
superfragment model of the Kreutz system, proposed by
Sekanina (2002) and implemented by Sekanina & Chodas
(2004). The subsequently developed alternative model
(Sekanina & Chodas 2007) adopted the 1106 comet as
the parent to the 1843 comet. Following the appearance
of comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3) and other relevant new
developments in the past 10 years, these models were up-
graded by the recent introduction of a novel conceptual
model (Sekanina 2021; referred to hereafter as Paper 1),
in which the birth of the Kreutz system was linked to a
breakup of the contact-binary progenitor near aphelion
about two millennia ago. The 1106 comet was presented
in this model as the most massive fragment of Lobe I and
the precursor of the 1843 comet. The perihelion time
of the 1106 comet was then found to have ﬁtted a uni-
form time sequence of three generations of Population I
fragments, derived from Aristotle’s comet of 372 BC as
the progenitor. However, temporal eﬀects triggered by
the indirect planetary perturbations, by the outgassing-
driven nongravitational forces, and/or by other possible
mechanisms in the course of recurrent near-perihelion
fragmentation events were all ignored, and this is being
corrected in the present paper.

3. NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE ORBITAL MOTION OF
COMET IKEYA-SEKI

The 119 observations used by Marsden (1967) to com-
pute the orbit of the primary nucleus, A, of Ikeya-Seki
are all included in the list presented in the Minor Planet
Center’s database1 The list contains a total of 129 astro-
metric observations, of which 78 are preperihelion data
points from a period of 1965 September 21 through Oc-
tober 16; nine data points from the early post-perihelion

period of October 28 through November 1, before dis-
covery of the companion nucleus, B; and 42 positions of
nucleus A from November 5 on. The actual number of
reported astrometric observations was much higher, but
none of the grossly inaccurate ones made it into the list.
For example, missing are 23 of 27 positions originally
published by the Central Bureau for Astronomical Tele-
grams on 1965 December 1 and all of those reported on
December 17 and 30 (Gingerich 1965, Marsden 1965).

The key astrometric observations were made by Z. M.
Pereyra and J. J. Rodr´ıguez with the 33-cm f/10.5 astro-
graph of the C´ordoba Observatory (Pereyra 1971): the
ﬁrst measured images were exposed by Pereyra on 1965
September 21.38 UT, less than three days after discov-
ery; the last preperihelion and the ﬁrst post-perihelion
observations were made by Rodr´ıguez on October 16.36
and 28.35 UT, respectively. The length of the preperihe-
lion arc covered by the observations was merely 25 days.
Further positional data in the early post-perihelion pe-
riod, until November 1 (11 days after perihelion), were se-
cured by Roemer (Roemer & Lloyd 1966) and by Lourens
(1966). The secondary nucleus B was detected ﬁrst on
November 4.53 UT (Pohn 1965), but no astrometry was
available from the period before November 12. The last
reduced images of either fragment were acquired by Tam-
mann (1966) with the Palomar Observatory’s 122-cm
Schmidt telescope on 1966 January 14.33 UT, 85 days af-
ter perihelion;2 they were measured by Marsden (1967).
Overall, the comet’s orbital arc covered by the astromet-
ric observations extends over 115 days; however, there is
a data gap from 5 days before to 7 days after perihelion.

3.1. Approximating the Motion of the Pre-Split Nucleus
Our ﬁrst objective was an in-depth review of the orbit
of comet Ikeya-Seki based on the available set of preper-
ihelion observations to conﬁrm that they were utterly
inadequate for determining the comet’s past motion. We
tested the veracity of this conclusion by deriving several
orbital solutions. Our computer code accounted for the
perturbations by the planets, Pluto, and the three most
massive asteroids, and for the relativistic eﬀect. A gen-
eral solution using all 78 preperihelion data points left
residuals from three observations that exceeded 4′′ in one
coordinate, and these were subsequently removed from
the set. Eventually we obtained the orbital period from
solutions based on 78, 75, 74, 72, and 70 data points.
Summarized in Table 1, they show that the orbital pe-
riod came out to be indeterminate, with enormous mean
errors, conﬁrming that this was not the way to proceed.
Instead, we followed a rather diﬀerent path. We be-
gan by assuming, for the sake of argument, that the
1106 comet was the previous appearance of Ikeya-Seki,
as suggested by Marsden (1967). We subtracted the
Julian date of the perihelion time of the 1106 comet,
nominally 1106 January 26 according to Hasegawa &
Nakano (2001), from the Julian date of the 1965 per-
ihelion passage of comet Ikeya-Seki to yield a pre-
split barycentric orbital period of Pbar = 859.68 years,
equivalent to a barycentric reciprocal semimajor axis of

2 Porter (1967) noted that the comet was seen on ﬁlms ex-
posed with the Baker-Nunn cameras at two stations of the Smith-
sonian Astrophysical Observatory in late January and, possibly,
mid-February, but none of these images was ever measured.

exercise led to an osculating reciprocal semimajor axis
of (1/a)osc = +0.010800 AU−1 and an orbital period of
Posc = 891 years.

We next employed this value of (1/a)osc in forced or-
bital solutions to examine the degree of compatibility of
the comet’s preperihelion astrometric observations with
the premise on its previous perihelion passage in 1106.
4′′
We found that all 78 ﬁtted this premise to within
3′′.5, a greater degree of conformity
and 74 to within
than in the formally optimized solutions in Table 1.
This implied that the orbital periods much longer than
900 years were unrealistic.

±

±

We accepted that the comet’s fragmentation had taken
place at a time of less than one hour from perihelion
(Sekanina 1982, Sekanina & Chodas 2007) and pursued
an objective of deriving an orbital period that was repre-
sentative of the comet’s true motion before splitting, thus
eliminating or mitigating the problems that plagued the
computations leading to the unsatisfactory results in Ta-
ble 1. We based our strategy on the fact that orbital
positions of the most massive fragment of a split comet
get aﬀected by the fragmentation event only gradually,
a number of days, if not weeks, later. This is docu-
mented by an often considerable lapse of time between
the breakup (as determined by an appropriate method)
and the ﬁrst detection of nucleus duplicity (or multiplic-
ity).3 For example, a typical nuclear fragment’s velocity
of 1 m s−1 relative to the comet’s center of mass would
not generate a potentially measurable position shift ex-
ceeding, say, 1000 km (equivalent in an extreme case to a
3′′ at a geocentric distance of
projected position shift of
0.5 AU) until approximately 12 days after the breakup,
which for Ikeya-Seki would be November 2.

∼

This kind of argument led us to a conclusion that the
comet’s credible pre-split orbital period could success-
fully be approximated by extrapolating a sequence of or-
bital runs, each of which links the set of preperihelion as-
trometric observations with a diﬀerent set of early post-
perihelion observations. We obtained four such sets of or-
bital solutions based on the 72 preperihelion data linked
with, successively, two post-perihelion observations made
on October 28 (the earliest post-perihelion data); four
observations from October 28–29; six observations from

3 For comet Ikeya-Seki this time amounted to two weeks.

October 28–31; and nine observations from October 28–
November 1. If these early post-perihelion observations
are accurate, the runs should oﬀer a set of barycentric
orbital periods, Pbar, and times of the previous perihe-
lion, Tprev, that display a systematic trend when plotted
as a function of the termination date. Extrapolation of
these values of Pbar and Tprev back to the termination
date equaling the time of fragmentation should provide
the desired credible estimates of the pre-split values. The
values of Pbar and Tprev derived from runs whose termina-
tion dates are located beyond this early post-perihelion
period are expected to be noisy, slowly converging to
Marsden’s (1967) values for nuclear fragment A, and of
lesser interest to this numerical exercise.

−

The results are presented in Table 2. The individ-
ual columns list: the time of termination observation,
tﬁn, and its reference to the perihelion time, tﬁn −
T
(the ﬁrst observation, tﬁrst, having always been Septem-
29.80 days); the oscula-
T =
ber 21.38 UT and tﬁrst−
tion value of the reciprocal semimajor axis, (1/a)osc, for
the epoch of 1965 October 7.0 TT and its mean error;
the corresponding past barycentric value, (1/a)bar; the
past barycentric orbital period, Pbar, and its mean error;
the derived nominal time of the previous perihelion pas-
sage, Tprev; the mean residual of the orbital solution; the
number of observations used, separately before and af-
ter perihelion; and the computed oﬀset of the secondary
nucleus B from the primary A at tﬁn. It is a measure of
the oﬀset of A from the center of mass of the pre-split
comet, which is expected to be its very small, approxi-
mately proportionate fraction.

For the sake of comparison, the ﬁrst row of the table
shows yet another useless solution based solely on the
preperihelion observations. The numbers in the subse-
quent rows show that adding a few early post-perihelion
observations to the 72 preperihelion data points reduces
the barycentric orbital period by some 300 yr and its for-
mal error by a factor of more than 20. And regardless
of these errors, the orbital solutions in rows 2 to 5 of
the table, whose termination observations were between
Oct 28 and Nov 1, consistently display, as expected, a
modest systematic trend in the predicted perihelion time
and have the mean residuals measurably lower than the
subsequent solutions based on longer arcs and including
the later post-perihelion observations. When extrapo-
lated from the early post-perihelion termination dates
to the time of fragmentation, Oct 21.20 UT, the orbits
nominally imply November 1139 for the time of comet
Ikeya-Seki’s previous perihelion Tprev and 825.9 yr for its
2.0 yr
barycentric orbital period Pbar, with an error of
introduced by the extrapolation.
Including the formal
errors from the orbital solutions, the derived perihelion
time still diﬀers by 2σ from the time of appearance of
the 1106 comet.

±

Starting with row 6, Table 2 provides information on
the orbital solutions that include the termination dates
of Nov 6, two days after the discovery of the secondary
nucleus, or later. In terms of the time Tprev these solu-
tions are incompatible with the four solutions in rows 2 to
5, and are more noisy, as seen from their mean residuals.
The disparity in Tprev is clearly apparent from Figure 1.
Yet, all values of Tprev in the plot deviate by one to at
least three decades from the time of appearance of the
1106 comet in the same direction.

a Preperihelion observations + post-perihelion observations.

The formal error of the orbital period in Table 2 de-
pends strongly on the length of the orbital arc covered
by the observations. The errors from the solutions with
the termination points after Nov 1 are lower than those
in rows 2 to 5, even though the mean residuals vary in
the opposite direction. One may question the meaning of
these errors and suggest that the orbital periods and the
implied perihelion times from the solutions with the ter-
mination dates of October 28 through November 1 could
in fact be more accurate than they appear to be.

This argument is supported by the distribution of indi-
vidual residuals listed for the orbits in rows 2–7 of Table 2
in Table 3. It is discouraging to see most of the highly
consistent observations from Oct 28–Nov 1 to leave sys-
tematic residuals of 2′′ to 3′′ in right ascension from the
solutions whose termination dates were after Nov 1. In
fact, this trend continued to the ﬁnal orbit of fragment
A and was only slightly reduced by incorporating non-
gravitational terms into the equations of motion.

Comparison of Marsden’s (1967) relativistic set of the
orbital elements for nucleus fragment A with our best
gravitational and nongravitational orbits is oﬀered in Ta-
ble 4. The nongravitational solutions were computed us-
ing Style II formalism of Marsden et al. (1973). We were
rather surprised that it was possible to derive the ra-
dial nongravitational parameter A1 with a formal error
as small as 20 percent. However, the value of A1 ap-
pears to be about an order of magnitude higher than
expected and it may be a product of the computing
methodology, namely, the linkage of the preperihelion
observations of the pre-split nucleus with the full set of
the post-perihelion observations of fragment A.

We were even more surprised that we were able to de-
rive both the radial parameter A1 and the transverse pa-
rameter A2, even though the former was now determined
with a higher error. The most unexpected result of this
two-parameter nongravitational run was the predicted
time of the previous perihelion passage, nearly 50 years
after the appearance of the Great Comet of 1106. While
this very late time is not necessarily very signiﬁcant, it

accentuates the diﬃculties with the 1106 comet as Ikeya-
Seki’s parent.

3.2. Eﬀects of Ikeya-Seki’s Fragmentation on
the Orbital Period
Intuitively, the sets of orbital elements for the two frag-
ments into which a comet has split are plausible limits
for conﬁning the set of pre-split elements, as the frag-
ments presumably acquired diﬀerential momenta in the
opposite directions. Indeed, in implementing their two-
superfragment model, Sekanina & Chodas (2004) argued
that the osculating orbital period of the pre-split nu-
cleus of comet Ikeya-Seki should have been between 880
and 1055 years (i.e., the orbital periods of the two frag-
ments, as computed by Marsden 1967), but much closer
to the ﬁrst because the primary fragment should have
been substantially more massive than the secondary and
subjected to a much smaller eﬀect. It so happened that
by choosing the orbital period slightly longer than the
period of the primary fragment, it was possible to read-
ily link Ikeya-Seki with the 1106 comet, with an implied
primary-to-secondary mass ratio of 15:1.

A view from another angle suggests that the orbital
period of the pre-split comet does not have to lie between
the orbital periods of the two fragments and can in fact
be the shortest of the three. Let ∆P be the diﬀerence
between the osculating orbital periods of the primary, A,
and secondary, B, fragments of the comet at the adopted
epoch of 1965 October 7.0 TT, as derived from Marsden’s
(1967) standard orbital solutions:

∆P = PB −

PA = +175

5 yr.

This result oﬀers a total eﬀect but says nothing about the
nature of the forces that were responsible for the diﬀerent
motions of the two fragments. The hypothesis that it
was due to an outgassing-driven diﬀerential acceleration
comes from a study of the fragments’ relative motion; in
the orbital computations the diﬀerential acceleration is
known to masquerade as an eﬀect in the orbital period
(or the eccentricity).

TIME OF TERMINATION OBSERVATION, tﬁn − tfrg (days from fragmentation)

Figure 1. The time of the previous perihelion passage of comet Ikeya-Seki in the 12th century, implied by the orbital solutions with
diﬀerent termination points in the orbit following fragmentation. Only the early post-perihelion observations, not later than November
1 (or 12 days after perihelion), could be used as termination points to orbital solutions that oﬀer consistent results, with the previous
perihelion nominally in late AD 1139. Fragmentation appears to have taken place only a fraction of an hour after the 1965 perihelion. Note
that the ordinate of not a single data point in the plot is near the time of appearance of the 1106 comet (X/1106 C1).

The motion of fragment B relative to fragment A of
comet Ikeya-Seki was investigated by Sekanina (1982),
for the split comets. The nucleus
using his model
was found to have broken up 23
7 minutes after
perihelion and the (radial) nongravitational acceleration
0.03 units of 10−5 the Sun’s gravitational
was 0.67
acceleration. The magnitude of the force, assumed to
vary inversely as the square of heliocentric distance, r,
was at 1 AU from the Sun equivalent to
−2.

only a fraction of its total is included in the value of ∆P

Inserting next the value of γ from (2), P = 880 yr, and
rfrg = 0.00807 AU, one gets

∆Psubl = 373 yr,

(10)

a result that is very diﬀerent from ∆P in (1). This means
that the diﬀerence between the fragments’ orbital periods
was not caused by the outgassing eﬀect alone.

The other eﬀect is schematically shown in Figure 2,
which depicts an irregularly shaped nucleus very shortly
before and after it split tidally in two along a section
approximately perpendicular to the radius vector. The
breakup is most likely to occur when the longest dimen-
sion of the nucleus is aligned with the direction to the
Sun, as the tidal eﬀect reaches then a maximum. The
nucleus is broken up in one of two possible ways: the
primary, more massive fragment A ends up on the sun-
ward side, or on the antisunward side. At the moment of
the breakup, both fragments have the same orbital veloc-
ity, but their centers of mass are at uneven heliocentric

distances, whose diﬀerence equals the distance between
their centers of mass. As a result, the two fragments
begin to move in diﬀerent orbits, with absolutely no mo-
mentum exchange involved. Diﬀerentiating the expres-
sion for the orbital velocity V , we have at fragmentation:

2V dV = k2

where a is the semimajor axis of the pre-split comet,
da is the diﬀerence between the semimajor axes of the
separated fragments, and dr is the diﬀerence between the
heliocentric distances of the fragments’ centers of mass.
Diﬀerentiating the relationship between the semimajor
axis and the orbital period, we have

da = 2

(12)

Next, we note that dr in (11) equals ℓ, the diﬀerence in
the distance from the Sun between the centers of mass at
the time of the breakup, in the sense fragment B minus
fragment A and, similarly, dP in (12) equals ∆Psep, the
diﬀerence in the fragments’ orbital periods triggered by
this ﬁnite separation distance ℓ, also in the sense frag-
ment B minus fragment A. Since dV = 0 in (11), we get
for ℓ by inserting from (12) into (11)

ℓ = 1

This relation means that when the secondary fragment
is farther from the Sun at breakup (ℓ > 0), it is injected,
by this virtue alone, into an orbit of longer period than
the primary fragment as shown in Scenario I in Figure 2,
and vice versa.

We now propose that the two eﬀects, one driven by the
outgassing, ∆Psubl, and given by (9), plus the other, trig-
gered by the radial separation of the fragments’ centers

of mass at breakup, ∆Psep, and given by (13), should,
when added together, result in the diﬀerence in the or-
bital period, ∆P , ascertained from the standard orbital
solutions for the fragments and given by (1):

∆Psubl + ∆Psep = ∆P.

This condition gives for Ikeya-Seki

and implies that, from (13), the separation between the
two fragments’ centers of mass equaled

(15)

ℓ =

−

8.0 km.

(16)

Being negative, the distance ℓ ﬁts Scenario II in Figure 2:
the secondary fragment, B, was at the time of breakup
at the sunward end of the parent nucleus. It is further
apparent from Figure 2 that the center of mass of the pre-
split comet was also sunward of the center of mass of the
primary fragment and that therefore the pre-split comet
moved in an orbit of shorter period than the primary nu-
cleus.
In addition, of course, it is very likely that the
primary fragment was subjected to a higher nongravita-
tional acceleration than the parent nucleus, which should
increase the diﬀerence in their orbital periods further.
The purpose of this exercise was to call attention to an
eﬀect involving the center of mass of fragments in events
of tidal disruption and allowing one to oﬀer limited in-
formation on the fragments’ sizes, which we comment on
in Section 3.3.

Using the diﬀerentiation was very convenient, but
made the results approximate especially because the dif-
ferences were relatively large. For example, an expression
for ℓ more accurate than (13) is

As a word of caution, we note that reports of addi-
tional, temporary fragments may suggest other possible
explanations for the short orbital period of the pre-split

(cid:17)

comet Ikeya-Seki, not necessarily negating a momentum-
exchange eﬀect. Hirayama & Moriyama (1965) reported
that only minutes after perihelion they observed corona-
graphically the comets’s head splitting into three compo-
nents, one of them being much brighter than the other
two. We believe that this event was not the one giv-
ing birth to fragment B. Independently, Pohn (1965) re-
marked on a potential third nucleus on November 4.5 UT,
while Andrews (1965) noted that on November 6.1 UT
the secondary nucleus was possibly a triple complex. It
is beyond the scope of this paper to judge the potential
inﬂuence of these transient phenomena on the orbit of
the pre-split nucleus, and we limit ourselves to merely
mentioning them for the beneﬁt of the reader.

3.3. The Ramiﬁcations
In Section 3.1 we argued that before splitting at its
1965 perihelion, comet Ikeya-Seki was moving in an or-
bit of a period that was shorter than that of either frag-
ment. The comet’s previous return to perihelion was
thus found to have occurred decades after the appear-
ance of the Great Comet of 1106, most probably near
the year 1139, and oﬀering strong evidence for ruling out
the 1106 comet as Ikeya-Seki’s parent and previous ap-
pearance. And because there is no doubt that the Great
September Comet of 1882 and Ikeya-Seki were on their
approach to their previous perihelion a single object, our
result rules out an association between the comets of 1106
and 1882 as well.

In Section 3.2 we showed that it is dynamically feasible
for a sungrazer, prior to its breaking up tidally in close
proximity of perihelion, to move in an orbit with a shorter
period than that of either of its two nuclear fragments,
thereby corroborating the results of Section 3.1. This
problem deserves further attention in the future.

The probable time of the previous perihelion return of
Ikeya-Seki around the year 1139 opens two questions: one
is the role of the Great Comet of 1106 in the history of
the Kreutz system, the other is the whereabouts of the
parent to Ikeya-Seki and the 1882 comet. The ﬁrst ques-

Figure 2. Elongated cometary nucleus of a sungrazing comet
shortly before and after breaking up tidally into two uneven frag-
ments at perihelion. Turned to the Sun (to the right) at the time
of breakup is the larger end of the nucleus, to become the primary
fragment A, in Scenario I, but the smaller end, to become the sec-
ondary fragment B, in Scenario II. The large circled dots are the
positions of the centers of mass of the parent (or pre-split) nucleus,
at the top of either panel, and of the fragments A and B at the
bottom. Accordingly, the orientation relative to the Sun alone as-
sures that fragment A ends up in an orbit of a shorter period and
fragment B in an orbit of a longer period than was the parent in
Scenario I, whereas the opposite is true in Scenario II.

tion was addressed in part by Sekanina & Chodas (2008),
when they concluded that the orbit for the Great March
Comet of 1843 derived from the best available astromet-
ric observations did not rule out its previous return to
perihelion as the Great Comet of 1106.

The two giant sungrazers of the 19th century, the Great
March Comet of 1843 and the Great September Comet
of 1882, moving in orbits similar but not nearly identical
and representing two major populations of the Kreutz
system, implied the existence of two major sungrazers
in the ﬁrst half of the 12th century, given that their
barycentric orbital periods were close to 750 years.4 Yet,
no candidate other than the 1106 comet has ever been
seriously proposed. The solution to this problem was
usually circumvented by pointing out that a sungrazer
arriving at perihelion between late May and early August
approaches from behind the Sun and recedes in that same
direction, thus being missed unless it is bright enough to
be seen in broad daylight. Closer inspection of relevant
circumstances shows that this is not necessarily so, but
it is true that such a sungrazer could at best be detected
as an unimpressive naked-eye object whose record in his-
torical annals would be far less notable than that of the
1106 comet.

We did not undertake a concerted eﬀort in search for
the “missing” sungrazer, but merely conducted a cursory
perusal of Ho’s (1962) catalogue of the ancient and me-
dieval observations of comets in the Far East. Under the
entry 403 we came across brief descriptions of two obvi-
ously diﬀerent objects from late August and September
1138, one Japanese, the other Chinese. The Japanese
object was of no interest, but the text on the Chinese
comet caught our attention. The primary source was the
29th volume of Sung Shih, a historical account of the
Sung Dynasty compiled from older sources in 1345, and
the secondary source was the 14th volume of Hs¨u Thung
Chien Kang Mu. The relevant record for 1138 says:

On September 3 a broom star (hui) was
observed in the east. It went out of sight
on September 29.

The used terminology (hui) suggests that the comet had
a tail (even though its length was not given) and, while
not explicitly stated, the comet must have been seen in
the morning sky, before sunrise.

This Chinese comet of 1138 is neither among the
Kreutz candidates proposed by Hasegawa & Nakano
(2001) nor on England’s (2002) list of possible early
Kreutz sungrazers. Hasegawa’s (1980) catalogue con-
tains this object under the entry number 636 and notes
that it also was included in the compilations by Pingr´e
(1783) and by Kanda (1935). The circumstances at the
time of appearance of this possible major sungrazer are
examined in some detail in Section 4.

We call attention to a case of remarkable coincidence,
as Marsden’s (1967) integration of Kreutz’s (1888, 1891)

4 Unfortunate was the lingering belief that the orbital period of
the 1843 sungrazer was much shorter, near 500 yr, predicated on
the earlier results by Kreutz (1901) and by Hubbard (1852) before
him, while still others (e.g., Nicolai 1843) noted that the choice of
the orbital period made almost no diﬀerence in the representation
of observations. The modern revision, with a period longer than
700 yr deemed feasible, had been unavailable until fairly recently
(Sekanina & Chodas 2008).

nonrelativistic orbit of the brightest fragment B (No. 2 in
Kreutz’s notation) of the Great Comet of 1882 back in
time gave the previous perihelion passage in April 1138,
only months before arrival of the proposed Kreutz can-
didate.5 The center of mass of fragment B was appar-
ently slightly sunward of the center of mass of the 1882
parent comet at the time of its perihelion fragmenta-
tion, which together with a contribution from the dif-
ferential outgassing-driven nongravitational acceleration
could provide a near-zero eﬀect in the orbital period be-
tween the parent and fragment B. If so, the times of
the previous perihelion for nucleus fragment B and the
parent comet should be about the same and the amazing
agreement of Marsden’s prediction with the timing of the
1138 comet may not be fortuitous.

The data on the fragmentation of Ikeya-Seki oﬀer lim-
ited information on the size of the comet’s nucleus. In
a ﬁrst approximation, the distance of 8 km between the
centers of mass of the two fragments in (16) equals the
semidiameter of the long axis of the pre-split nucleus. If
the axial ratios are, for example, 1:1:2, the eﬀective di-
ameter of the pre-split nucleus is 10 km. If the comet
of 1138 is indeed the previous appearance of Ikeya-Seki,
the diﬀerence between the orbital periods of nuclear frag-
ment A (our gravitational or A1 nongravitational solu-
tion) and the pre-split comet is about 22 yr. Interpreted
in its entirety as an eﬀect of separation at fragmentation
(rather than a sublimation eﬀect), it oﬀers a lower limit
to the fragment A-to-fragment B mass ratio equaling 8,
equivalent to a lower limit of 2 for the fragment A-to-
fragment B size ratio. The eﬀective diameters of frag-
ments A and B then come out to be about 9.6 km and
4.8 km, respectively.

4. THE CHINESE COMET OF 1138
Even though the description of the Chinese comet of
1138 in Ho’s (1962) catalogue is brief, important insights
into the issue of the object’s association with the Kreutz
system can be gained. We approximate the angular el-
ements and perihelion distance of the orbit of the 1138
comet by the values originally derived for the presumed
1106 apparition of the Great September Comet of 1882
(Sekanina & Chodas 2002), assume the orbit to be a
parabola, and address the membership issue in some de-
tail in the following.

4.1. Observing Site
To examine the observing conditions, we need to have
an idea on the geographic location of the probable ob-
serving site. The (southern) Sung Dynasty’s capital was
Jiangning (today a southern district of Nanjing, the capi-
tal of Jiangsu Province) until 1138 and Lin’an (nowadays
a district of Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province)
from 1138 on.6 The distance between the two cities,
where information on the comet’s sightings was presum-
ably coming from, is only about 200 km and their loca-

5 The relativistic orbit of fragment B of the 1882 comet was
computed by Hufnagel (1919), who derived a period shorter than
the period of Kreutz’s nonrelativistic orbit by more than 10 yr.
This large diﬀerence makes Hufnagel’s result, which according to
Marsden (1967) implies November 1149 for the time of the previous
perihelion passage of the 1882 comet, rather suspect.

6 The northern territories of the Sung Dynasty were lost to the

Jin Dynasty in 1127.

tions can approximately be depicted by geographic lon-
gitude 120◦ east of Greenwich, latitude 31◦ north of the
equator, and 20 meters above sea level. The observing
window up to sunrise on September 3, between 4:00 and
5:40 local time, is equivalent to Sept 2.83–2.90 UT.

4.2. Limiting Magnitude
Before addressing the issue of light curve of the 1138
comet, we examined the observing conditions during the
critical period of time in the morning of September 3, the
day of the ﬁrst recorded sighting, and September 29, the
day of disappearance. The conditions for detecting, with
the unaided eye, a stellar object of apparent visual mag-
nitude Happ at a given location of the sky from a given
observing site are described by a limiting magnitude,
Hlim, determined from an algorithm developed by Schae-
fer (1993, 1998) as a function of (i) the object’s solar and
lunar elongations; (ii) the object’s, Sun’s, and Moon’s el-
evations above the local horizon, and the Moon’s phase;
and (iii) the atmospheric and other conditions at the ob-
serving site. The algorithm also allows for seasonal and
long-term eﬀects. In a recent paper, Sekanina (2022; re-
ferred to hereafter as Paper 2) employed the Schaefer
algorithm, strictly valid for stellar objects, to comets.

Moonlight interfered with observation of the 1138
comet on both September 3 and September 29. The new
moon was on September 6.29 UT and October 5.96 UT.
We adopted an obvious view that because disappearing
26 days after the ﬁrst sighting the comet was during
September gradually fading and therefore receding from
the Sun, having passed perihelion before September.

An estimate of the perihelion time was a key param-
eter for investigating the comet as a potential Kreutz
sungrazer. A crude guess was obtained by straight-
forwardly comparing the 1138 comet to comet Pereyra
(C/1963 R1), a deﬁnite member of the Kreutz system
discovered on 1963 September 14 and passing perihelion
21 days earlier. By simply shifting the dates, the peri-
helion passage of the 1138 comet was predicted to have
taken place on August 13. In spite of the vastly diﬀerent
circumstances at the two comets’ arrival times more than
800 years apart, this guess eventually turned out to be
not too far oﬀ the mark, to the extent we can judge.

Based on this guess, we selected three candidate dates
— July 23, August 1, and August 10 — for the 1138 per-
ihelion time. For the observing site deﬁned in Section 4.1
and the dates of 1138 September 3 and 29 we computed,
for a number of times (between the comet’s rise above
the eastern horizon and sunrise) at a step of 18 min-
utes, the horizontal coordinates (the azimuth reckoned
from the south clockwise) of the Sun, the Moon, and

the comet on each of the three perihelion-time assump-
tions, and derived the limiting magnitudes as a function
of time. On September 3 the comet was found to have
risen between 3:43 and 3:57 local time (19:43 to 19:57 UT
on September 2) as the perihelion time advanced from
July 23 to August 10, while sunrise occurred on 5:43 lo-
cal time (21:43 UT on September 2). This means that
the comet could be observed for quite a bit less than two
hours in early September. On September 29 the comet
could be seen over three hours, so that the more restric-
tive viewing conditions on September 3 oﬀered tighter
constraints on the perihelion time.

The quantities that varied during observation are pre-
sented in Table 5 for the morning hours of September 3
and in Table 6 for September 29, while the other po-
sitional data on the comet, the Sun, and the Moon on

September 3 and 29 as a function of the comet’s assumed
perihelion time are listed in Table 7. The comet’s az-
imuths in Table 5 show that the condition of the comet
appearing on September 3 in the east was closely sat-
isﬁed; at elevation 12◦, for example, to 9◦ if perihelion
occurred on August 10, to better than 12◦ if on August 1,
and to better than 13◦ if on July 23.

The curves of the limiting magnitude in Tables 5 and
6 are U-shaped. On September 3 the bright ends re-
ﬂect, respectively, the high atmospheric extinction as the
comet rose above the horizon before 4:00, and the dawn
eﬀect before sunrise a minute or so before 5:45. Only be-
fore about 4:30 is the limiting magnitude on either date
aﬀected signiﬁcantly by moonlight. The comet should
have been the fainter — but also the sooner above the
horizon — the earlier it passed through perihelion. The
brightness eﬀect favors a later perihelion passage, the
horizon-crossing eﬀect an earlier one. Perihelion on Au-
gust 10 would require the comet to have been of mag-
nitude 1–2 or brighter on September 3. An important
conclusion from Table 6 is that the comet should have
been close to magnitude 4.2–4.3 on September 29 re-
gardless of the perihelion time, given its disappearance
on that day. Combined with a brightness estimate on
September 3, based on the limiting magnitudes in Ta-
ble 5, the assumption of August 10 perihelion implies
that the comet should have faded steeply with heliocen-
tric distance r, more steeply in fact than r−4, otherwise
it could be seen on September 3 for only a short period
of time at very low elevations. These arguments suggest
that the comet’s perihelion passage occurred with high
probability before August 10.

We further note that a sungrazer of apparent mag-
nitude 4.2–4.3 six weeks after perihelion — the scenario
with perihelion on July 23 — implies an intrinsically very
bright comet. Such a comet should have been sighted
sooner at a smaller solar elongation than 40◦ (Table 7).
It is improbable that perihelion took place as early as
July 23. While the exact date of perihelion remains un-
known, we ﬁnd it most likely that the comet passed per-
ihelion within several days of August 1. Below we adopt
the Chinese comet of 1138 as the presumed parent to the
Great September Comet of 1882 and comet Ikeya-Seki,
and August 1 as the date of its perihelion passage.

In Table 8 we present an ephemeris of the 1138 comet,
assuming perihelion on August 1.0 TT. The ephemeris
is short in terms of the number of entries, which are the
15◦
midpoints of astronomical twilight (with the Sun
below the horizon), but it is extended in terms of the
number of listed quantities. The table allows one to ac-
knowledge that, of the nine listed dates, moonlight was
disturbing on four. The interference on September 21,
just hours after the full moon was so strong that the
comet may have been lost only to be marginally detected
again before its ultimate disappearance, to which moon-
light also contributed its share. The ﬁnal two columns
of Table 8 will be commented on in the next section.

4.3. Light Curve of the Comet of 1138
In the absence of any direct information, we turn for
help to Paper 2, in which the problem of sungrazers’ light
curves was discussed in broad terms. A comet’s visual
brightness was investigated using the usual power-law
formula, which on a magnitude scale is

Happ(r, ∆; H0, n) = H0 + 2.5n log r + 5 log ∆,

(19)

where r = r(t) is the heliocentric distance and ∆ = ∆(t)
the geocentric distance (both in AU) of the comet at
the time of observation, t; H0 is the absolute magnitude
(normalized to r = ∆ = 1 AU); and n is a photometric
exponent equal to the power of heliocentric distance with
which the brightness, normalized to a unit geocentric
distance, inversely varies, r−n. Since the light curves
of major Kreutz sungrazers are known to be, in gen-
eral, asymmetric relative to perihelion, the preperihelion
0 , n−, and the post-perihelion parame-
parameters, H
ters, H +
0 , n+ were examined in Paper 2 separately. The

−

preperihelion photometric exponents of all major Kreutz
sungrazers were assumed to be constant7 and equal to
n− = 4, while the post-perihelion photometric exponents
were deemed a function of perihelion fragmentation. For
a sungrazer with the nucleus breaking up at perihelion
into Nfrg fragments, the post-perihelion value of the ex-
ponent was adopted to vary as

n+ = 4.4

0.2Nfrg,

(20)

−
where Nfrg = 1 when the comet does not fragment. This
equation expresses the well-known fact that major sun-
grazers fade rather rapidly, unless they break into per-
sisting fragments at perihelion. This empirical relation-
ship is based on an extensive amount of data on comet
Ikeya-Seki, a modest set of data on the Great Septem-
ber Comet of 1882, and fragmentary data on the Great
March Comet of 1843, collected in Paper 2. The preper-
−
ihelion absolute magnitudes H
0 were estimated at 5.9
for Ikeya-Seki, 3.4 for the 1882 sungrazer, and 3.5 for the
1843 sungrazer. The post-perihelion absolute magnitude

comet (assuming Nfrg = 5 to 6), and 4.2 for the 1843
comet (Nfrg = 1). From (22) the post-perihelion abso-
lute magnitude came out to be 5.9 for Ikeya-Seki,
0.2
for the 1882 comet, and 4.6 for the 1843 comet. The par-
ent sungrazers were arbitrarily assigned in Paper 2 the
preperihelion absolute magnitudes 0.6 mag brighter than
their primary fragments (the 1843 and 1882 comets). We
now recognize the comet of 1138 as one of the two par-
ents.

the SOHO Kreutz sungrazers.

The number of fragments into which the 1138 comet
broke up is of course unknown, but it could not be smaller
than two — the 1882 comet and Ikeya-Seki. Poten-
tially, the comet may also be a parent to Strom’s (2002)
sun-comet of 1792 as well as to the probable sungrazer
X/1702 D1 (Kreutz 1901; Marsden 1967); that would
make the number of the persistent fragments equal four.
We can only speculate whether another major fragment
might arrive in the coming decades. If we accept that
the nucleus of the 1138 comet split at perihelion into the
four pieces, then its light-curve parameters n+ = 3.6 and
−
H +
0 = 2.8 or 0.6 mag brighter
−
than H
0 for the 1882 comet). The post-perihelion light
curve then follows the formula

0 = 0.7 (assuming that H

Happ = 0.7 + 9 log r + 5 log ∆.

(23)

The ephemeris in Table 8 provides the apparent mag-
nitudes from this formula in the penultimate column.
The table’s last column oﬀers the values for the visi-
bility index of the comet at the midpoint of astronomi-
cal twilight. One can see that for more than two weeks
after September 3 the computed magnitude was com-
patible with the comet’s visibility with the unaided eye.
The situation worsened suddenly with the arrival of the
full moon on September 21, when the predicted visual
perception of the comet apparently indicated it dropped
below the detection threshold. Toward the end of the
month the interference by moonlight subsided a little,
but the comet grew gradually fainter until eventually
vanishing, as the limiting magnitude after September 29
remained essentially constant.

ℑ

The tabulated values of the visibility index

were
computed assuming constant atmospheric conditions, an
assumption that is unavoidable but in practice never sat-
isﬁed. For example, the observing conditions deteriorate
as air humidity climbs; an increase from 50 percent to
80 percent can cause the visibility limit can shoot up
by 0.5 mag or more. A few days with higher humid-
ity beginning on September 29 may have been all that
was needed for this date to be recorded as the point of
disappearance.8

Our last item on the light curve proposed for the 1138
comet is a plot of the apparent magnitude against the so-
lar elongation when the brightness variation with helio-
centric distance follows the law (23) after perihelion and
0 = 2.8, n− = 4.0) before peri-
the corresponding law (H
helion. Displayed in Figure 3, the suggested light curve
is compared with the naked-eye limiting magnitude in
both broad daylight and twilight. The twilight curve is
constructed for the most favorable case of the comet and
the Sun sharing the same azimuth, i.e., when the comet’s
solar elongation equals the diﬀerence between the eleva-
tions of the comet and the Sun.

8 Given that the full moon occurred on Aug 22.5 and Sept 20.9
Chinese time, a scenario that is perfectly compatible with the pub-
lished record is rather heretic: if Ho’s dates were oﬀ (late) by eight
days, the ﬁrst sighting would have been on Aug 26, about four
days after the full moon, when the observing conditions greatly
improved relative the previous days (as Table 8 shows a month
later) and the comet would have disappeared on Sept 21, just hours
after the next full moon. Although Ho (1962) provides no informa-
tion on his methods of conversion of the Chinese calendar to the
Julian/Gregorian calendar, we are certain that, barring an inexpli-
cable blunder, the chance of a converted date in the 12th century
being oﬀ by eight days is nil.

Figure 3. The proposed light curve for the Chinese comet of
1138, plotted as a function of solar elongation. The thin line refers
to the preperihelion branch, the thick line to the post-perihelion
branch. Perihelion is marked by a star. The points of ﬁrst sight-
ing on September 3 and the disappearance on September 29 are
also indicated. The extent of the solar disk is depicted by short
vertical lines. Just before perihelion the comet was passing almost
centrally across the Sun. The comet’s light curve is compared
with the limiting magnitude of a stellar object for the unaided
eye according to Schaefer’s (1993, 1998) algorithm. One limiting-
magnitude curve applies to the conditions in broad daylight, the
other under twilight’s most favorable conditions when the comet
and the Sun have the same azimuth (the solar elongation equaling
the diﬀerence between the elevations of the comet and the Sun).
Boundaries between astronomical, nautical, and civil twilight are
shown. No moonlight eﬀects are plotted.

The plot of the light curve in the ﬁgure looks rather
bizarre, in part because the comet stayed extremely close
to the Sun after perihelion for so long. While 12 hours
before perihelion the comet was 3◦.5 from the Sun, the
separation was less than 1◦ 12 hours after perihelion! At
solar elongations greater than 20◦ the comet is predicted
to have been signiﬁcantly fainter before perihelion and to
have attained apparent magnitude 6 only when 22◦ from
the Sun. It thus must have been entirely out of reach of
naked-eye detection. At solar elongations smaller than
15◦, the comet is predicted to have been brighter before
perihelion and at elongations smaller than 6◦ it should
have been brighter than the naked-eye limiting magni-
tude. At that time the comet had just a little over
24 hours to get to perihelion. In about six or so hours
after perihelion the comet’s brightness dropped to a level
close to the limit and stayed near or below that level for
at least two weeks, until the comet was some 20◦ from
the Sun. It took only two more weeks (with the Moon

Comets X/1106 C1, 1138, and 363 in History of Kreutz Sungrazer System

above the horizon in the meantime) before the comet was
discovered.

4.4. Tail of the Comet of 1138
Although the historical record quoted by Ho (1962) re-
ferred to the comet as a broom star — a term used for
objects with a tail — no information was provided on
the tail’s length. This should not be surprising if the
observed tail was unimpressive. An independent inves-
tigation of the tails of Kreutz sungrazers (Sekanina, in
preparation) shows that some ﬁve weeks after perihelion
the tails of the 1882 comet and Ikeya-Seki were dom-
inated by microscopic dust subjected to solar radiation
accelerations not exceeding 0.6 the solar gravitational ac-
celeration. On September 3 the tail of the 1138 comet
should on this condition have been less than 8◦ long.
Theoretically, the length could have grown up to nearly
12◦ by September 29, but the data on other sungrazers
suggest that two months after perihelion only a small
fraction of the tail’s computed length could be seen with
the naked eye. Because of the geometry, the tail pointed
away from the earth. Its end on September 3 is calcu-
lated to have been at a geocentric distance of 2.5 AU and
it must have been rather faint. The unfavorable geome-
try (next to moonlight) also explains the short visibility
period of the comet.

Kreutz sungrazers become spectacular objects over
short periods of time thanks to their early post-perihelion
tails (from several days to two weeks after perihelion for
comet Ikeya-Seki, for example). The tails are sometimes
10 to 100 times brighter than the head. To become a
spectacle, the sungrazer does not have to be a giant, but
needs to arrive at the “right” time of the year. The 1138
comet could serve as an example of a sungrazer that ar-
rived at the “wrong” time of the year. Its path in the
sky appears to have stayed within one degree of the Sun
in the ﬁrst 12 hours after perihelion, when its predicted
light curve in Figure 3 is shaped like a “spiral to obscu-
rity,” losing 8 magnitudes. If the comet had arrived seven
weeks later, it could have been comparable in brightness
to the Great September Comet of 1882, if 80 days later,
it could have been more prominent than Ikeya-Seki. And
if it arrived six months earlier or later, it could success-
fully compete with the appearance of the Great Comet
of 1106.

On the other hand, the record of the 1138 comet in
historical sources and our sungrazer diagnosis suggest
that intrinsically bright Kreutz sungrazers reaching per-
ihelion in early August were not necessarily missed com-
pletely — when undetected in broad daylight — by pre-
telescopic northern-hemisphere observers, notwithstand-
ing the numerous instances of claim to the contrary in
the literature. However, like the comet of 1138, they
were likely to have appeared to the naked eye as unim-
pressive broom stars in the morning sky and followed for
a few weeks. We suspect that the same argument applies
to other bright Kreutz sungrazers that reach perihelion
between late May and late July.

5. PERIHELION ASYMMETRY OF PRODUCTION CURVE
AND NONGRAVITATIONAL PERTURBATIONS OF A
COMET’S ORBITAL MOTION

The outgassing-driven nongravitational perturbations
of the sungrazers’ orbital motions, explored in Sec-

tion 3, and the apparent asymmetry of their light curves,
importance to
examined in Section 4, are of critical
our further investigation of the Kreutz system, because
there appears to be a degree of correlation between the
two parametric functions. This issue was brought to
the forefront of attention following the 1986 return of
1P/Halley, as Rickman (1986) and Rickman et al. (1987)
argued that the comet’s water production curve showed
a strong asymmetry with respect to perihelion, imply-
ing that the contributions from the radial component of
the sublimation-driven nongravitational force (parame-
ter A1) integrated over the revolution about the Sun did
not cancel out, basically a variation of Bessel’s (1836)
concept. In line with this argument, Festou et al. (1990)
and Rickman et al. (1992) proposed a hypothesis accord-
ing to which the water-production asymmetry essentially
determines the magnitude of the nongravitational pertur-
bations impacting the orbital period, relegating eﬀects of
sublimation lag, expressed by the transverse component
(parameter A2), to the status of a minor factor. While it
is inadmissible to use the production-rate asymmetry for
determining a magnitude of the outgassing eﬀect on the
orbital period (Sekanina 1992, 1993), the two quantities
are statistically correlated. And even though Festou et
al.’s dataset consisted exclusively of short-period comets,
the correlation appears to be valid generally.

In relation to the Kreutz system, this result implies
that, as a matter of rule, the orbital motions of the
sungrazers that are brighter before perihelion should be
slightly accelerated, whereas the motions of the sungraz-
ers brighter after perihelion should be decelerated. This
dependence is further correlated with tidal fragmenta-
tion near perihelion, as profusely fragmenting sungrazers
have a tendency after perihelion to fade less steeply than
those subjected to insigniﬁcant or no disruption (cf. Pa-
per 2).

It is unfortunate that the symmetric sublimation law
still is a universal tool in Marsden et al.’s (1973) orbit-
determination software package available to numerous
users at present, almost 50 years after it was experi-
mentally incorporated into the nongravitational model
that at the time was still in the process of continuing
reﬁnement. While it is possible to vary the law’s pa-
rameters (such as its steepness, for example), it is not
possible to use diﬀerent functional relations before and
after perihelion. Similarly, the law’s peak cannot be
moved away from perihelion. There is a version of the
Style II formalism with an asymmetric sublimation law
in existence, conceived (Sekanina 1988) and implemented
(Yeomans & Chodas 1989) to accommodate the nongrav-
itational motions of the short-period comets whose gas
production (and activity in general) peaks either pro-
foundly before perihelion (such as 2P/Encke in the early
times, 3D/Biela) or after perihelion (such as 1P/Halley,
6P/d’Arrest). However, this type of asymmetric law is
not appropriate for application to the sungrazers, whose
activity peaks always very near perihelion but the preper-
ihelion and post-perihelion slopes of production curves
may be widely uneven. To incorporate a broad range
of nongravitational laws in the orbital code should be
straightforward, yet no such software package is widely
available to our knowledge.

In the broader context, we emphasize the urgent need
for solving the long-overdue problem with the sublima-

14

Sekanina & Kracht

tion law in orbit-determination software. A wide range
of options must be available to the user, in line with
the recognized enormous behavior diversity of comets,
increasingly perceived in their motions thanks to the
steadily improving quality of astrometric observations.
In the current versions of orbital software the selection
of sublimation laws is mostly limited to the choice of the
standard function’s constants. By further postponing a
radical solution to this problem, the cometary commu-
nity runs the risk that continuing chronic diﬃculties will
prevent orbital investigations from keeping up with the
rapid progress in cometary physics, with which they are
increasingly intertwined.

6. LONG-TERM ORBIT INTEGRATION INTO THE PAST:
A FEASIBILITY STUDY

To the extent that the Chinese comet of 1138 indeed is
the parent body of the Great September Comet of 1882
and comet Ikeya-Seki, the problem of the missing sec-
ond major Kreutz sungrazer in the early 12th century
has been settled. Under these circumstances, the Great
Comet of 1106 is perceived, almost by default, as the
previous appearance of the Great March Comet of 1843
and a precursor of countless smaller fragments of Popu-
lation I.

−

6.1. The Great Comet of 1106
The tail of the comet of 1106 is discussed elsewhere
(Sekanina, in preparation); here we display in Figure 4
this spectacular comet’s predicted light curve, as a func-
tion of solar elongation, to be compared with the pre-
dicted light curve of the 1138 comet in Figure 3. In line
with Paper 2, we are adopting for the comet of 1106 a
0 = 2.9, n− = 4.0 and
set of preperihelion parameters H
post-perihelion parameters H +
0 = 4.0 and n+ = 4.2. The
assumed preperihelion parameters of the comets of 1106
and 1138 are nearly the same, but after perihelion the
1106 comet is intrinsically four magnitudes fainter at
1 AU from the Sun. Although its light curve is steeper,
it does not surpass the light curve for the 1138 comet
even at that comet’s perihelion distance of 0.008 AU.9
Yet, the 1106 sungrazer was a spectacle after perihelion,
while the performance of the 1138 comet was lackluster.
The perihelion time of the 1106 comet is a point of
contention. Hasegawa & Nakano (2001) provide nomi-
nally January 26, but there are two caveats: one is the
large error,
5 days, that the authors put on their value;
the other is a report of the comet observed on February 2
only one cubit (about 1◦) from the Sun in broad daylight
(e.g., Kronk 1999). This condition requires the comet to
have been no more than several hours past perihelion.
On the curve in Figure 4 we accordingly mark the ﬁrst
sighting of the comet for two perihelion times. The ob-
serving circumstances long before perihelion appear to
have been very favorable, but the comet was then at
high southern declinations. As seen from Figures 3 and
4, he 1106 and 1138 comets were both likely to have been
several magnitudes brighter than the limit for naked-eye
detection in broad daylight just days before perihelion,

±

9 The peak of the 1106 comet’s light curve in Figure 4 exceeds
the peak of the 1138 comet’s light curve in Figure 3 only because
the perihelion distance of the former was about two thirds the
perihelion distance of the latter.

Figure 4. The proposed light curve for the Great Comet of 1106
plotted as a function of solar elongation. The point of ﬁrst sighting
is plotted for two perihelion times, January 26.5 TT and February
2.0 TT. It was argued in Paper 2 that under moderate or better
observing conditions historical sungrazers often did not disappear
until the head was near magnitude 7, because it was the tail, a few
magnitudes brighter, that was last seen. For further comments on
the plotted curves, see caption to Figure 3.

yet neither was detected. Except for the early 1106 day-
light sighting, the observing periods of the two comets
were rather similar, supporting the notion that the 1138
comet was the missing sungrazer.

6.2. Progenitor’s Lobe I and Its Main Surviving Mass
As the Great March Comet of 1843
The issues that have remained untouched as yet have
been those of the early evolution of the Kreutz system. In
the contact-binary model (Paper 1), a daytime swarm of
brilliant comets in late 363 recorded by Ammianus Mar-
cellinus, a Roman historian, was proposed to be the ﬁrst
perihelion appearance of the Kreutz sungrazers. As sep-
arate bodies the sungrazers were less than 500 years old,
having originated as a product of fragmentation of the
massive progenitor in the general proximity of aphelion
near the beginning of the Christian Era.

The primary event was proposed to have been a break-
up of the contact-binary progenitor into essentially two
lobes — the early precursors of the main populations, I
and II — depicted schematically in Figure 5. As already
pointed out, the 1843 and 1882 sungrazers were deemed
the largest surviving masses of Lobe I and Lobe II, re-
spectively. In line with this scenario, we undertook or-
bital computations to test the feasibility of the two fun-
damental steps in the proposed early evolutionary path

LOBE I

Figure 5. Schematic representation, at the time of breakup, of
the Kreutz system’s parent (progenitor) nucleus, modeled as a ro-
tating contact binary in Paper 1, consisting of Lobe I, Lobe II,
and the connecting neck. The view is from the direction of the
Sun and the position of the original orbital plane is deﬁned by
the parent’s pre-breakup orbital velocity vector Vpar. The dot in
the middle of the neck is the center of mass of the parent, coin-
ciding with the projected spin axis, which at aphelion is assumed
to point at the Sun. As a result of the breakup, the lobes are
subjected to orbital perturbations. At the time of breakup the
comet rotates counterclockwise, so that Lobe I is released to the
lower right, moving relative to the center of mass in the direction
of the separation velocity vector Vsep, while Lobe II is released to
the upper left, moving in the direction of the separation velocity
vector −Vsep. The separation velocity consists of its transverse,
VT, and normal, VN, components, the radial one is assumed to
be VR = 0. Summed up with the parent’s pre-breakup orbital-
velocity vector, the separation velocities insert Lobe I into a new
orbit deﬁned by the velocity vector VI and Lobe II into an orbit
deﬁned by the velocity vector VII. The Great March Comet of
1843 is the largest surviving mass of Lobe I, the Great September
Comet of 1882 is the largest surviving mass of Lobe II. For clarity,
the orbital and separation velocities are not drawn to scale; in the
scenario in Paper 1 the ratio |Vsep|/|Vpar| = 0.13.

of the Kreutz system: (i) Could the daylight comets of
AD 363 be orbitally linked with the comets of 1106 and
1843 on the one hand and with the comets of 1138 and
1882 on the other hand; and (ii) could Aristotle’s comet
of 372 BC be the fragmenting progenitor?

In Section 3 we examined the motions of two observed
sungrazer fragments, the products of a presumed tidal
breakup of their parent at or near perihelion. Their
orbital periods diﬀered dramatically on account of two
eﬀects. One of them was triggered by the diﬀerential
outgassing-driven nongravitational acceleration and ac-
counted for by integration of the continuous contribu-
tions from outgassing along the orbit. Long-term eﬀects
in the orbital period of this sublimation scenario are han-
dled by nongravitational orbital solutions.

Major changes in the orbital period could also be gen-
erated as a corollary of tidal fragmentation in close prox-
imity of perihelion. When no momentum exchange is
involved, the nascent fragments have the same orbital
velocity as the parent, but their centers of mass are lo-
cated at slightly diﬀerent heliocentric distances, causing
the fragments to end up in orbits with diﬀerent semima-

jor axes and periods. This is a fragmentation scenario
whose long-term eﬀects in the orbital period could only
be handled by modeling the main features of the frag-
mentation events, with help of gravitational and/or non-
gravitational orbital solutions.

In the following we maintain that the evolution of the
Kreutz system has been governed by combined eﬀects
articulated by the sublimation scenario on the one hand
and by the fragmentation scenario on the other hand.
While the two categories of eﬀects mix at some unknown
variable ratio to scatter sungrazers and their fragments
around, we focus below on ﬁnding out whether either cat-
egory can explain — in the entirety or to an extent — the
observed properties of the Kreutz system on its own, ob-
viously a more diﬃcult task to accomplish. We have em-
ployed the same orbit-determination package of software
as in Section 3, fully accounting for both the perturba-
tions by the planets, Pluto, and the three most massive
asteroids, as well as for the relativistic and nongravita-
tional eﬀects, using the Style II formalism by Marsden
et al. (1973).

Numerical experimentation used in the extensive in-
vestigation of comet Ikeya-Seki in Section 3 showed two
perplexing features: (i) considerable inﬂuence and total
unpredictability of the indirect planetary perturbations,
which implied the absence of any uniformity or pattern
in the sequence of perihelion times; and (ii) problems re-
lated to the sublimation law symmetric relative to peri-
helion, the issue that already was addressed in Section 5.
In the absence of an appropriate law, the asymmetry
was matched imperfectly by introducing the transverse
component of the nongravitational acceleration via the
parameter A2.

Turning ﬁrst to the sublimation scenario, we at-
tempted to link, in a single orbital run, three consecutive
perihelion returns of Lobe I, ending chronologically with
the Great March Comet of 1843. The starting set of
elements for integration back in time was this comet’s
gravitational orbit referred to as Solution II in Sekanina
& Chodas (2008). It already was optimized to satisfy the
1106 comet’s perihelion time of January 26, proposed by
Hasegawa & Nakano (2001), yet it provided an essentially
equally good ﬁt to the re-reduced 1843 astrometric ob-
servations as the nominal least-squares Solution I. When
integrated back to the 4th century, Solution II provided
a perihelion time on 392 September 19. The diﬀerence
of about 29 years needed to ﬁt the adopted perihelion
time of 363 November 15 suggested that the comet had
been accelerated over the period of nearly 15 centuries
(363–1843).

To investigate the magnitude of the acceleration, we in-
corporated the nongravitational terms into the equations
of motion and searched, by trial and error, for the op-
timum value of the parameter A2, while simultaneously
adjusting slightly the eccentricity (by about 30 percent of
the diﬀerence between Solutions I and II in the paper by
Sekanina & Chodas 2008). The adopted radial nongrav-
itational parameter A1 of 10−10 AU day−2 represents a
reasonable value for the nucleus estimated at some 50 km
in diameter but, as noted in Section 5, its value has nearly
no eﬀect on the results because of the symmetric non-
gravitational law that the method uses. Very similar
orbital solutions could thus be derived with other values
of A1. The successful linkage of the three consecutive

returns of Lobe I, presented in Table 9, is manifested by
the parametric value of A2, which was optimized by ﬁrst
re-ﬁtting the perihelion time in 1106 and then iterating
the relationship between the eccentricity and the param-
eter A2 until the previous perihelion time proposed in
Paper 1, 363 Nov 15, was matched. This value of A2,
shown in Table 9, is smaller than A2 for any long-period
comet in the catalogue by Marsden & Williams (2008).
A successful linkage of the perihelion returns in 1843,
1106, and 363 within the framework of the sublimation
scenario alone is thus shown to be feasible. The param-
eter A3 of the normal component of the nongravitational
acceleration was assumed to be zero, because this com-
ponent could not aﬀect the perihelion time.

The linkage of the three consecutive perihelion returns
implies that the orbital eﬀect of fragmentation on the
Great March Comet of 1843 was insigniﬁcant enough
that ignoring it did not prevent the formulation of a
straightforward nongravitational solution, which over a
period of 15 centuries provides supporting evidence for
the evolutionary model proposed in Paper 1.

We next turned to the fragmentation scenario for
Lobe I. The modus operandi was predicated on the fact
that one corollary of a breakup is the instantaneous re-
distribution of a single mass into fragments, accompanied
by repositioning of the original center of mass into the
centers of mass of the fragments. The small value of A2
in Table 9 encouraged us to neglect the nongravitational
eﬀect altogether. Accordingly, we started from the same
gravitational Solution II for the 1843 sungrazer (Sekan-
ina & Chodas 2008). As in the sublimation scenario, we
ran the orbit back to 1106 to the point of birth of the
1843 comet, which became the dominant fragment of the
Great Comet of 1106, its parent and itself a fragment of
the original Lobe I.

The focus of our interest at this point was the na-
ture of the fragmentation event, speciﬁcally the sepa-
ration between the centers of mass of the parent and
the fragment along the radius vector (Figure 2). The
time of osculation coincided with the time of fragmen-
tation, tfrg, assumed to have taken place at perihelion.
when in the ecliptical coordinate system the position vec-
tor of the center of mass of the nascent 1843 comet was
Ufrg = (Xfrg, Yfrg, Zfrg). The unknown position vector
of the center of mass of the parent comet in the eclip-
tical coordinate system was Upar = (Xpar, Ypar, Zpar).

vector determined the fragment’s orbit.
ure 2, the orbital-velocity vector of the parent at tfrg,
Vpar = ( ˙Xpar, ˙Ypar, ˙Zpar) equaled the fragment’s veloc-
ity vector. The diﬀerence between the position vectors
of the 1106 and 1843 comets at tfrg imply the existence
of one or more additional fragments, which we comment
on brieﬂy later.

At a given heliocentric distance of the point of frag-
mentation, rfrg, the position vector of the parent can be
derived from the position vector of the fragment and vice
Ufrg in
versa. The vectorial diﬀerence ∆U f →p = Upar
1106 depends according to Equation (17) on the orbital
period of the parent comet, Ppar, between the perihelion
passages in 1106 and 363, and on the hypothetical orbital
period of the fragment, Pfrg, between 1106 and its past
projected perihelion in 392, established by the computa-
tions made for this particular case. The derived periods
are Ppar = 742.186 yr and Pfrg = 713.339 yr.

In the arguments leading to Equation (17) we con-
cluded that, because of the nature of the tidal disrup-
tion, the vector ∆Uf→p(rfrg) points essentially either
in the direction of the radius vector rfrg (when positive)
or in the opposite direction (when negative). We re-
place ∆Uf→p(rfrg) with ∆Uf →p(rfrg) and simplify the
formula for its magnitude to

Once ∆Uf →p(rfrg) is known, we proceed to the com-
putation of the orbital elements of the 1106 comet. In a
general case, when the point of fragmentation is at a he-

where Px, . . . , Qz are the standard direction cosines and
ufrg is the true anomaly at fragmentation. In the case of
fragmentation at perihelion the transformation formulas
get simpliﬁed accordingly. Since the indirect planetary
perturbations may change slightly the orbit, one may
not obtain the prescribed perihelion time of 363 Novem-
ber 15 exactly, and one or more iterations may be nec-
essary. Indeed, the value of ∆Uf →p had to be changed
from 0.6974 km to 0.6981 km to ﬁt the adopted perihe-
lion time in 363 exactly.

The sets of gravitational orbital elements of Lobe I at
the three returns to perihelion between 363 and 1843,
based on the fragmentation scenario, are listed in Ta-
ble 10. Comparison with Table 9 shows that the diﬀer-
ences in all the elements between the two categories of
orbits are trivial, with the possible exception of the or-
bital period. An obvious conclusion is that applications
of both the sublimation scenario and the fragmentation
scenario, either one on its own, satisfy the constraints
of the evolutionary model of the Kreutz system over the
15 centuries. Orbit integration prior to the year 363 and
its ramiﬁcations will be addressed in Section 7.

6.3. Possible Nuclear Sizes of Comets 1106 and 1843
and Population of Minor Kreutz Comets
The shift ∆Uf →p between the parent and a fragment
is an important quantity that provides information on
the fragment’s approximate dimensions and their rela-
tionship to the parent’s dimensions.
In general terms,
the smaller the shift, the larger the fragment’s size. Al-
though no reliable data are available, the nucleus of the
1882 sungrazer was crudely estimated at 50 km in diam-
eter (Sekanina 2002), and the 1843 and 1882 sungraz-
ers are probably of comparable sizes. From this vantage
point, a shift in the position of the center of mass by

mere 0.7 km is strong evidence that during the perihelion
breakup of the 1106 comet most mass remained concen-
trated in one fragment — the 1843 sungrazer. Since the
shift is sunward — measured from the parent to the frag-
ment — minor fragments were at the antisunward end of
the parent, while its sunward half did not fragment at
all; in Figure 2 this ﬁts Scenario I.

On certain assumptions about the shape of the parent
object, one can provide even some quantitative estimates.
Let the parent be approximated by a prolate spheroid of
an arbitrary axial ratio, whose long axis pointed at the
time of fragmentation toward the Sun, and let the dom-
inant fragment, in this case the 1843 sungrazer, be rep-
resented by a truncated prolate spheroid, which extends
from one end of the spheroid to a plane normal to the
long axis at a certain distance, d, from that end. Assign-
ing the parent’s spheroid a unit volume, we measure, in
these units, the volume
of the truncated spheroid by a
dimensionless parameter ζ, which equals the ratio of the
distance d to the extent of the long axis:

The parent’s center of mass is given by ζ = 1

the fragment’s center of mass has obviously ζ < 1

volume of the truncated spheroid needs to be expressed
in terms of ∆Uf →p. In order to do that, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity, ψ, by

The remaining part of the spheroid, modeled as a
spheroidal cap, is in this case 6.5 km long and has a
volume of 3.75 percent of the parent. Its center of mass
is 23.5 km from the center of mass of the parent and
its calculated orbital period exceeds 20,000 years. This
mass is essentially lost to the system and it may never
be discovered.

Up to now we only considered tidal breakups taking
place exactly at perihelion and separation of fragments
from the long end of a spheroidal nucleus. In reality, tidal
fragmentation events may have happened (or continued
happening) shortly before or after perihelion, in which
case the shifts ∆Uf →p(rfrg) increased in magnitude and
the orbital periods of large numbers of fragments were
conﬁned to a narrower range, many exceeding the or-
bital period of the parent by less than a factor of two. In
addition, the parent’s nucleus was unquestionably an ir-
regular body with variable tensile strength, so that tidal
fragmentation proceeded in parts other than one end of
its longest dimension as well. Finally, especially minor
fragments could have been shed from the body of the
parent/main fragment by forces other than tidal; in the
extremely hostile environment of the Sun’s inner corona
such mass shedding should be part of the bulk fragmen-
tation process. As long as the shedding is accompanied
by no momentum exchange, the fragments end up essen-
tially in the orbits governed by ∆Uf →p(rfrg).

In this context we note that the separation times for
the individual nuclei of the Great September Comet of
1882, derived from their observed separations by Sekan-
ina & Chodas (2007), averaged 1.8 hours after perihelion,
at which time the comet’s heliocentric distance was twice
the perihelion distance, or 3.3 R⊙. For the 1843 sun-
grazer the corresponding fragmentation distance would
be 2.3 R⊙. At such a distance, a large number of Kreutz
sungrazers and potential Kreutz sungrazers of Popula-
tion I could be ﬁtted as fragments of the 1106/1843 comet
with moderate ∆U shifts. A shift of about
20 km could
explain the concentration (or at least a major contribu-
tion to the concentration) of potential Kreutz sungrazers
in the middle and the second half of the 17th century, in-
cluding the candidate comets of 1663, 1666, 1668, 1673,
and 1695 on Hasegawa & Nakano’s (2001) list. Positive
values of ∆U could apply to a number of known Kreutz
3.5 km ﬁts C/1880 C1 and
sungrazers: for example,
C/1882 K1, the eclipse sungrazer;10
11.5 km ﬁts the
sungrazers picked up by the coronagraphs on board the
Solwind (P78-1) and Solar Maximum Mission satellites;
and 12 to 14 km ﬁts the SOHO and STEREO sungraz-
ers from the 1990s through 2020s, whose orbital peri-
ods should be close to 900 years. An exception is comet
Pereyra (C/1963 R1), which appears to be a fragment of
another subcategory of Population I and its evolution is
brieﬂy described in Section 8.

6.4. Orbital Relationship Between the Great September

Comet of 1882 and Comet Ikeya-Seki

Before we examine the sublimation and fragmentation
scenarios of the comet of 1138, we return to the problem
of the pre-fragmentation orbit of comet Ikeya-Seki and its

relationship to the orbit of the Great September Comet
of 1882. A major point of Marsden’s (1967) paper was his
virtual proof that on approach to the previous perihelion
in the 12th century the two comets were one.

Our surprising conclusion that Ikeya-Seki was previ-
ously at perihelion as the Chinese comet of 1138 more
than 30 years after the Great Comet of 1106 was not
accompanied by the full set of elements of the pre-
fragmentation orbit. In the meantime, we were pursuing
several avenues in an eﬀort to determine such an orbital
set, but were repeatedly encountering a variety of prob-
lems. Our ultimate choice was based on an inference
from the perturbation theory that a fragmentation event
at perihelion, not involving momentum exchange, mea-
surably aﬀects the orbital period (or, equivalently, the
semimajor axis or eccentricity) but not the other ﬁve
elements. Their post-perihelion variations have roots
mostly in the nongravitational forces, so that — again
with the exception of the eccentricity and equivalent ele-
ments — the orbit of the most massive fragment should
provide the closest approximation to the orbit of the pre-
fragmentation comet. For Ikeya-Seki, the most massive
fragment was unequivocally nucleus A.

The same argument suggested that among the frag-
ments of the Great September Comet of 1882 it was its
nucleus B (or No. 2 in Kreutz’s notation) that should
provide the best approximation to the comet’s pre-
fragmentation orbit. The orbit of this nucleus, presented
in the Appendix, was our ﬁrst choice for the purpose of
comparison with the orbit of comet Ikeya-Seki, in spite
of the fact that it is nonrelativistic.11

±

Our ﬁrst concern was the time of the previous peri-
helion of the comet’s nucleus B, for which we obtained
1136 January 23; formal inclusion of the relativistic ef-
fect moved the perihelion forward by merely 37 days. As
the mean error of the orbital period is shown in the Ap-
pendix to amount to
2.8 yr, the estimated perihelion
time of the 1138 comet remained within 1σ of the pre-
dicted time of the 1882 comet’s previous return to peri-
helion. The very fact that the integration of this nucleus’
orbital motion oﬀered the “correct” time for the previous
return to perihelion of the pre-fragmentation nucleus of
the 1882 sungrazer is astonishing and its interpretations
range from sheer coincidence to evidence that fragment
B was indeed the primary nucleus, orders of magnitude
more massive than any other among the ﬁve or six major
fragments reported.

Of primary interest to us were the sets of orbital el-
ements of the 1882 sungrazer and comet Ikeya-Seki in
August 1138. To make it meaningful, we computed the
orbit of Ikeya-Seki without the relativistic eﬀect to match
the same quality of the orbital set available for the 1882
sungrazer. We integrated the orbits of both comets back
in time, adjusting in either case the eccentricity to force
the previous perihelion on 1138 August 1. In essence, we
applied the same test as Marsden (1967) did in his paper:
aiming at comparison of the orbits of the 1882 comet’s
nucleus B and Ikeya-Seki’s nucleus A at the time of their
presumed separation. The diﬀerence was that Marsden

11 The theory of general relativity, including its orbital ramiﬁca-
tions, was introduced by A. Einstein in 1915, just about a quarter-
century after Kreutz’s publication of the deﬁnitive orbits for the
nuclear fragments of the 1882 sungrazer in the second paper of the
series.

Notes.
a Diﬀerence in the orbital element between the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki.
b Absolute value of the ratio of the orbital diﬀerence between the two comets in 1138 presented in this paper to their diﬀerence in 1115 listed in
Table X of Marsden (1967).

assumed the separation in September 1115, whereas our
target date was some 23 years later. The outcome is pre-
sented in Table 11; the elements for an osculation epoch
in the start-up years of 1882 and 1965 are, respectively,
in columns 2 and 4; the 1138 elements in columns 3 and
5. The degree of similarity between the two comets in the
four relevant elements in 1138 is apparent from column 6;
the degree of similarity that Marsden (1967) found in
1115 is copied in column 7. Besides the fact that all
1138 diﬀerences were of opposite sign than the 1115 dif-
ferences, their comparison, in terms of an absolute value
of the 1138-to-1115 ratio, oﬀers a stunning result: the
orbital elements of the two comets were much more alike
in 1138 , the nodal longitude and the inclination by more
than one order of magnitude(!), the argument of perihe-
lion by a factor of nearly 3, and the perihelion distance
by a factor of about 2. The near-coincidence of the or-
bits of the two comets in 1138 is equally impressive when
measured by the mean errors of Kreutz’s elements in the
Appendix: the diﬀerences in the nodal longitude and in-
clination are smaller than 0.5σ(!), in the argument of
perihelion about 2σ, and in the perihelion distance, the
worst case, a little over 3σ. The tiny diﬀerences in the
nodal longitude and inclination show that orbital planes
of the two comets deviated from each other in 1138 less
than was the uncertainty of the 1882 comet’s orbital-
plane determination. The obvious conclusion is that the
year 1138 was a much better choice for separating Ikeya-
Seki from the 1882 sungrazer than the year 1115, not to
mention 1106. This is yet another piece of evidence that
contradicts the hypothesis of the 1106 comet being the
parent to the 1882/1965 pair.

6.5. Progenitor’s Lobe II and Its Main Surviving Mass
As the Great September Comet of 1882
The resemblance of the orbital elements (except for
the period and equivalent quantities) between the 1882
sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki in the year 1138 is so profound
that a tight relationship between the two objects cannot
be doubted. In the context of the contact-binary model,
their parent — and later the 1882 sungrazer — was the
largest surviving mass of Lobe II of the Kreutz system’s

progenitor (Figure 5). Long-term orbit integration of the
motion of Lobe II was carried out in the same manner as
that of Lobe I in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, engaging, respec-
tively, the sublimation and fragmentation scenarios.

To test the feasibility of a single orbital run linking
three consecutive returns of Lobe II, we again employed
Kreutz’s (1891) gravitational (nonrelativistic) orbit of
nucleus B (see the Appendix) but used, from now on,
orbit-determination software with the relativistic eﬀect
built in. As expected, a fairly minor adjustment in
the eccentricity was needed to ﬁt the adopted perihe-
lion time of the 1138 comet. The previous perihelion
was computed to have occurred on 459 Jan 29, nearly a
century later than the expected year 363, implying that
Lobe II was subjected to a much higher nongravitational
acceleration than Lobe I. The results of the search for a
nongravitational solution consistent with the sublimation
scenario conﬁrmed the suspicion. As shown in Table 12,
the required magnitude of the transverse acceleration was
now more than twice the adopted magnitude of the ra-
dial acceleration and more than ﬁve times the transverse
acceleration for the 1843 comet (Table 9). In case of the
1882 sungrazer the eﬀects that we tried to account for by
the nongravitational parameter A2 appear to have been
governed by fragmentation rather than by sublimation.
Application of the fragmentation scenario based pro-
cedures in the case of Lobe II was much more involved
than it had been for Lobe I in Section 6.2. Before we
began to investigate Lobe I, we did not know whether
it fragmented profusely, modestly, or not at all. On the
other hand, unquestionable evidence on fragmentation
of Lobe II was oﬀered by the breakup of the 1882 sun-
grazer and Ikeya-Seki, which had to be accommodated
by the contact-binary model. Referring to them as frag-
ments f1 (the 1882 sungrazer) and f2 (Ikeya-Seki), re-
spectively, the constraint provided by their orbital peri-
ods (Pf1 = 744.084 yr and Pf2 = 827.172 yr) was

tween the centers of mass of the two fragments. If the
1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki had irregular nuclei some
50 km and 10 km, respectively, in diameter, their cen-
ters of mass could hardly be separated by less than
20 km, which means that the fragmentation event
∼
of this kind could not have taken place closer to the
Sun than
2.2 times the perihelion distance, or about
0.018 AU (or nearly 4 solar radii) from the Sun, at least
2.2 hr before or after perihelion.

∼

The second constraint for Lobe II was provided by
the diﬀerence between the projected motion of the 1882
sungrazer integrated back in time from its 1138 peri-
helion to the previous hypothetical perihelion passage,
on 459 January 29 — implying an orbital period of
Pfrg = 679.491 yr — and the corrected motion dictated
by the expected perihelion of the parent on 363 Novem-
ber 15, implying Ppar = 774.696 yr. The computations
showed that the required shift of the center of mass at
the 1138 perihelion equaled

∆Uf →p(q) = +5.2499 km,

(33)

an eﬀect that was a factor of 7.5 greater than in the case
of Lobe I, shown in (26).

The motion of Lobe II between the returns of 363 and
1138 is determined by the condition (33); the sets of rep-
resentative gravitational orbital elements in the returns
of 1882, 1138, and 363, based on the fragmentation sce-
nario, are listed in Table 13. To accommodate the con-
ditions (32) and (33) during the 1138 perihelion passage,
we assumed again that the parent comet, approaching
perihelion was a prolate spheroid of an arbitrary axial
, which was
ratio and an unknown long-axis diameter
to be determined from the constraint (33). As in the
case of Lobe I, we were addressing the problem in terms
of dimensionless quantities, in units of
. We further as-
sumed that the parent split ﬁrst into two at perihelion,
satisfying (33), followed by the separation of the major
fragment into the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki hours
later.

Let us adopt for the 1882 sungrazer a diameter of 50 km
and for Ikeya-Seki a diameter of 10 km in the direction of
the spheroid’s long axis, so that
> 60 km. In Figure 6
we draw the points on the spheroid’s axis that describe
the fragmentation events. With the Sun to the right,
the points refer to the ﬁrst breakup in the upper panel
and to the second breakup in the lower panel. In either

panel A is the sunward end of both the surviving mass
of Lobe II and the 1882 sungrazer, O the center of mass
of Lobe II, C the center of mass of the 1882/1965 pair’s
parent, B its antisolar end, and W the boundary be-
tween the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki inside Lobe II.
In addition, in the upper panel, Z is the antisolar end of
Lobe II, so that B and Z are the boundaries of the minor
fragment that separated at perihelion, and G is its cen-

of mass of, respectively, the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-

ended up in an orbit with a period of about 1800 yr.

The major fragment, which was to split into the 1882
comet and Ikeya-Seki, continued to orbit the Sun as a
single body, until (32) was satisﬁed. To determine the

7.1. Kreutz Sungrazers at Perihelion in AD 363
The spectacle of brilliant daylight comets in AD 363,
recorded for posterity by Ammianus Marcellinus, a Ro-
man historian,12 was simulated in this feasibility study
as the ﬁrst perihelion appearance of the Kreutz system
after the progenitor’s fragmentation at large heliocen-

lion returns (in the 12th and 19th centuries) in that both
Lobe I and Lobe II contributed virtually simultaneously
to the event. We have shown that the perihelion returns
1843–1106–363 and 1882–1138–363 could both be linked
in the framework of either the sublimation scenario or the
fragmentation scenario, even though the high value of the
critical nongravitational parameter for Lobe II made the
veracity of the sublimation scenario suspect.

Since fragmentation events at large heliocentric dis-
tance are known to have a fairly minor eﬀect on the per-
ihelion time, we used the fragmentation-scenario tools to
derive the center-of-mass shifts ∆U in an eﬀort to deter-
mine the preliminary sets of orbital elements for Lobe I
and Lobe II in the period of time between 363 Novem-
ber 15 and the previous perihelion on -371 January 1.
The results are presented in Table 14. The two orbits
for the progenitor in 372 BC are of course artiﬁcial; the
ultimate orbit is going to be the product of simulation of
the process of near-aphelion fragmentation (Sections 7.2
and 7.3).

Comparison of Tables 10 and 14 for Lobe I and Ta-
bles 13 and 14 for Lobe II reveals a major diﬀerence
between the 12th century returns on the one hand and
AD 363 on the other hand: the center of mass of the ma-
jor fragment was located sunward of the parent object
in 1106 and 1138 (∆Up→f < 0; Scenario I in Figure 2),
but antisunward in AD 363 (∆Up→f > 0; Scenario II in

12 See Paper 1 for details and useful references on this subject.

Figure 2). This diﬀerence has an important ramiﬁca-
tion. Scenario I implies that a typical minor fragment,
or most minor fragments, should have the center(s) of
mass on the antisunward side of the parent’s center of
mass, should end up in highly elongated orbits, with the
periods much longer than 700–800 yr, and should not re-
turn to perihelion until some time in the distant future.
By contrast, Scenario II implies that minor fragments
have typically the centers of mass on the sunward side
of the parent’s center of mass, ending up in orbits with
the periods shorter, and potentially much shorter, than
700–800 yr. Such fragments might have become sungraz-
ers in their own right during the centuries following the
year 363, starting as early as the 6th century.

To inspect this issue quantitatively, we employ a rela-
tionship analogous to (25), expressing the orbital period
of a fragment, Pfrg, as a function of the orbital period of
the parent, Ppar, rather than vice versa:

Pfrg = Ppar

Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Lobes I and
II were in AD 363 nearly 100 km across each and that
a reasonable upper limit on the center-of-mass shift of a
fragment was about 45 km. Table 15 presents the orbital
periods that the fragments acquire as a function of (i) the
heliocentric distance at fragmentation (q being again the
perihelion distance) and (ii) the center-of-mass shift rel-
ative to the parent comet in AD 363 (see Table 14). It
is astonishing to see that in an extreme case the orbital
period could be as short as one-ﬁfth the parent’s orbital
period (
760 yr) for Lobe I and less than one-half of it
for Lobe II.

∼

In a second experiment, we picked up four of the poten-
tial Kreutz sungrazers from Hasegawa & Nakano’s (2001)
list in the 7th through 11th century and computed the
center-of-mass shifts that would be required if the comets
were fragments of Lobe I or Lobe II released at the 363
perihelion. It is seen that their orbits could readily be
accommodated this way, with the exception of the comet
of 607, which could not be a fragment of Lobe II.

23

From (41) it is obvious that the relation between the
orbital periods of the parent and a fragment is governed
by the ratio of ∆U/r2
frg. The eﬀect drops very rapidly
with increasing distance from the Sun but also with de-
creasing size of the object and its orbit. In practice it has
no meaningful application to fragmenting comets other
than sungrazers.

7.2. Line of Intersection of Lobes’ Orbital Planes and
Positions of Lobes at Fragmentation Time

In order to successfully simulate the separation of the
two lobes from the contact-binary progenitor near aphe-
lion, three conditions have to be satisﬁed in the barycen-
tric system: (i) the point of separation must be located
on the line of intersection of the lobes’ orbital planes;
(ii) the lobes must be at the same barycentric distance;
and (iii) they must reach the point simultaneously. Given
that the tabulated orbits are available at an osculation
epoch near perihelion, it is essential that before the ﬁrst
of the three conditions is addressed, the orbits be inte-
grated to a new osculation epoch chosen near aphelion
to make the simulation procedure tractable.

The line of intersection is obviously close to the lines of
apsides of the two lobes, as their longitudes and latitudes
of perihelion in AD 363 were very similar, 282◦.35 and
+35◦.43 for Lobe I and 283◦.05 and +35◦.27 for Lobe II.
To ﬁnd the line of intersection is straightforward. In the
ecliptic coordinate system, the unit vector R normal to
the orbital plane of a comet is a function of the longitude
of the ascending node, Ω, and the orbital inclination, i:

R =

Referring to the vector normal to the orbit of Lobe I as
R(I) = [Rx(I), Ry(I), Rz(I)], and to the orbit of Lobe II
as R(II) = [Rx(II), Ry(II), Rz(II)], a vector along the line
of intersection, L = (Lx, Ly, Lz) is given by their vector
product:

L = R(I)×R(II),

Since the position is near aphelion, one has to add 180◦
to the value obtained from (47) when the tangent is neg-
ative (pre-aphelion location), or subtract 180◦ when it
is positive (post-aphelion location). This true anomaly
gives the barycentric distance and time of Lobe I on the
line of intersection. The same procedure provides the
same data for Lobe II.

We next used the elements from Table 14 to determine
the position of the line of intersection of the orbital planes
of the lobes. We ﬁrst integrated their motions from peri-
helion in AD 363 to the previous aphelion and converted
the heliocentric system to the barycentric system. For
an osculation epoch at the end of 5 BC, the two orbits
and the gap between them are shown in Table 17. The
ecliptic components of the unit vectors R(I), R(II), L,
and the lobes’ true anomalies, uI, uII, and barycentric
distances, rI, rII, are summarized in Table 18. The angle
between the orbital planes was 13◦.23, while the line of
intersection made angles of 0◦.2 and 0◦.4 with the lines
of apsides of Lobe I and Lobe II, respectively.

Under rigorous conditions, it would next be a matter
of iteration to bring ﬁrst the barycentric distances and
then the times into harmony. One possible approach
would be to keep these two quantities constant for one
lobe, to select this time as the osculation epoch, and to
iterate these quantities for the other lobe: the barycentric
distance by varying ∆U of the pre-363 orbit, the time by
shifting the perihelion time in AD 363.

For two reasons we did not pursue this line of attack.
One reason was the tiny angles between the positions of
the line of intersection of the lobes’ orbital planes and the
lines of apsides, which indicated — given the approxima-
tions involved — that, angularly, the point of fragmenta-
tion was virtually indistinguishable from aphelion. The
other reason was that, in the context of the proposed
contact-binary model, both lobes were believed to have
undergone, before reaching their perihelion in AD 363,
events of secondary fragmentation, which were bound
to modify, however slightly, the positions of their or-
bital planes and thereby introduce additional uncertain-

that the breakup of the progenitor into the two lobes oc-
curred at aphelion and that Lobe I began to move in an
orbit described by the set of elements listed for it in Ta-
ble 17. This provided us with an opportunity to simulate
eﬀects by the separation velocity (Section 7.3).

7.3. Orbit of Progenitor Prior to Fragmentation and
Separation Velocities of the Lobes

−

Let at the adopted fragmentation time of

4 Dec 30,
UI = (xI, yI, zI) and VI = ( ˙xI, ˙yI, ˙zI) be, respectively, the
orbital-position and orbital-velocity vectors of Lobe I;
and let UII = (xII, yII, zII) and VII = ( ˙xII, ˙yII, ˙zII) be the
orbital-position and orbital-velocity vectors of Lobe II.
Whereas the two position vectors were equal (neglect-
ing the lobes’ dimensions), the velocity vectors were not.
Following Figure 5, the progenitor’s orbit was fully de-
scribed by the position vector Upar and the velocity vec-
tor Vpar, an average of the velocity vectors of the lobes.
In the ecliptic coordinate system,

Upar = UI = UII = (xpar, ypar, zpar)
Vpar = 1

2 (VI + VII) = ( ˙xpar, ˙ypar, ˙zpar).

(48)

By integrating these position and velocity vectors from
the osculation epoch back in time, the progenitor’s orbit
at the previous perihelion could readily be determined.

The derivation of the progenitor’s velocity by averag-
ing the lobes’ velocities implied that the fragments parted
at equal rates in the exactly opposite directions, as de-
picted in Figure 5. The diﬀerences between the lobes’
orbital velocities and the velocity of the progenitor were
the lobes’ separation velocities:
Vsep(I) = Vsep = ( ˙xI −
Vsep(II) = −Vsep = ( ˙xII −

˙zpar)

˙zpar).

(49)

Given that the investigation of the separation-velocity
vector was conducted in the coordinate system of RTN
rotating with the comet
(radial-transverse-normal),
along its orbit, it was ﬁrst necessary to convert the vec-
tor’s components into the ecliptic system. Writing VR for
the radial, VT for the transverse, and VN for the normal
component of the separation velocity of Lobe I relative
˙xpar, etc., for its ecliptic
to the parent and ˙xsep = ˙xI −
components, the transformation formulas were:

−

We were now ready to simulate the orbital conditions
at the primary fragmentation event that gave birth to the
Kreutz system: At aphelion, on
4 December 30, Aris-
totle’s comet, modeled as a bilobed rotating object, was
to split into two fragments (lobes) that were to end up
in the orbits presented in Tables 14 and 17.13 The goal
was to ﬁt, as closely as possible, the orbits of Lobes I
and II in AD 363 and 5 BC as products of the contact-
binary parent’s pre-fragmentation orbit by determining
the diﬀerential momenta (expressed in terms of the sep-
aration velocity vectors) that Lobes I and II acquired (in
the opposite directions) at the breakup.

In the case of the parent’s orbit being unknown, the
problem could equivalently be addressed by starting from
the orbit of one lobe — say, Lobe I — and by searching
for a separation velocity vector Vsep [see (49)], such that
its subtraction from the lobe’s orbital-velocity vector de-
termined the parent’s orbit, and its another subtraction
approximated the orbit of the other lobe — Lobe II —
at perihelion in AD 363 (Table 14). When successful,
this exercise demonstrates that the forthright splitting
of the progenitor into the two lobes is compatible with
their orbital properties.

To assure that the fragments arrived at their perihelion
in AD 363 in fairly tight formation (within days of one
another, thereby seen simultaneously), we set VR = 0, in
line with Papers 1 and 2. We began to address the task
by adopting for the other two separation velocity com-
ponents of Lobe I the values from Table 6 of Paper 2,
1.80 m s−1. These veloc-
VT =
ities had of course been derived from the 19th-century os-
culating orbits of the 1843 and 1882 sungrazers, thereby
ignoring all time dependent eﬀects, including the two-
millenia long, continuous planetary perturbations of the
two sungrazers and their precursors.

−

Contrary to the arguments associated with the quest to
explain the orbital diﬀerences among Kreutz sungrazers
(and especially the discrete populations) by a cumulative
eﬀect of the planetary perturbations over longer periods
of time, our results show that the gaps between the or-
bital elements of the two lobes, or equivaently, the 1843
and 1882 sungrazers, were being contracted with time.
Indeed, while the diﬀerence between the inclinations in
the 4th century was about 4◦, it was reduced to less than
2◦.5 in the 19th century; similarly, in the same period of
time the diﬀerence in the longitude of the ascending node
dropped from more than 21◦ to 16◦, and the diﬀerence
in the perihelion distance from 0.7 R⊙ to 0.5 R⊙. These
systematic trends manifestly demonstrate that the plan-
etary perturbations could not possibly account for the
existence of the Kreutz system’s populations.

The diminishing diﬀerences between the orbital ele-
ments of the two giant sungrazers intervened in our ef-
forts to simulate the initial magnitude of the separation
velocity between the lobes in that the numbers based on
the 19th century orbits turned out to have been much
too low. It was necessary to iterate the orbital solution,
with the result showing eventually that the transverse
component of the separation velocity was about 26 per-
cent higher and the normal component 54 percent higher
than estimated in Paper 2.

13 A possible independent separation of the neck was not simu-

lated in this exercise.

The outcome of our computer simulations of the birth
of the two most massive fragments of the Kreutz system
as products of the bilobed progenitor’s splitting is pre-
sented in Tables 19 and 20. Although we made no eﬀort
to strictly optimize the solution, we found that at the
adopted fragmentation time of
4 December 30.0 TT, es-
sentially the point of aphelion, either lobe separated with
a velocity, relative to the progenitor’s center of mass, of

−

The transverse and normal components of the separation
2.35 m s−1
velocity of Lobe I were, respectively, VT(I) =
2.77 m s−1; the radial component, as al-
and VN(I) =
ready noted, was forced to be nil. Thanks to this con-
dition, Lobe II — whose transverse and normal compo-
nents of the separation velocity were of the same magni-
tude, but of the opposite sign — reached its perihelion
in AD 363 only about 4.2 days after Lobe I. If the ra-
dial component were not nil — or close to nil — the two
lobes would have arrived at perihelion weeks, possibly
months, apart and they would not have been perceived
as an essentially single event, contrary to the impression
that one gets from the Roman historian’s account.

We note that even though the gaps between the or-
bital elements of the two lobes (Table 17) were greater
than between the osculating orbits of the 1843 and 1882
sungrazers, the separation velocity that accounts for the
gaps is still low. Interpreting it as the progenitor’s rota-
tion velocity, we could estimate the compatible rotation
period. If either lobe is assumed to be about 50 km in
diameter, so is the distance between the centers of mass.
If the circumference, 2π
50 = 314 km, is described in one
day, this equals 3.63 m s−1, derived in (51). The rotation
period of 24 hr is rather on the long side.

·

The 4-day gap between the perihelion times of the two
lobes is no surprise. In Paper 2 we anticipated a gap of
2.9 days with a lower separation velocity, showing that
the gap is an eﬀect of the transverse component. The
standard time of 363 Nov 15.0 TT that we have used
throughout this paper in search of the various orbital so-
lutions was essentially a default value, dictated by the
narrative on the observation of the daylight comets. We
could have used another date nearby with the virtually
identical outcome. Indeed, a change in Lobe I’s orbital
period of one month between AD 363 and 1106 is trig-
gered by a radial shift in the center-of-mass position of
only 1.7 meters at perihelion, a trivial eﬀect.

Either lobe is believed to have undergone events of sec-
ondary fragmentation not long after their birth. Accord-
ing to the model in Paper 2, Lobe I was likely to have
produced the precursors of Populations Pre-I and Pe, re-
spectively, whereas Lobe II was apparently the parent to
∗
. In the light of these
Fragment IIa and Precursor IIa
events, the agreement in Table 19 between the orbital
elements of Lobe II at the AD 363 and 5 BC epochs de-
rived from the back integration of the precursor orbit of
the Great September Comet of 1882 on the one hand and
from the precursor orbit of the Great March Comet of
1843 and the fragmentation parameters of the progeni-
tor on the other hand is astonishingly good. The high
degree of correspondence demonstrates in the very least
the feasibility — and in fact fundamental veracity — of
the proposed fragmentation hypothesis.

Another major conclusion is that Aristotle’s comet,
which according to historical accounts appeared in the
winter at the end of 373 BC or the beginning of 372 BC,
ﬁts our orbit simulation scheme as the putative contact-
binary progenitor. We no longer see any reason to doubt
this object’s signiﬁcance in regard to the Kreutz system.
We integrated the orbit of the progenitor back in time
over two revolutions about the Sun, showing the result
in Table 20.
It is perhaps somewhat surprising to see
the orbit of Aristotle’s comet resembling the orbit of the
Great September Comet of 1882 in both the angular ele-
ments and the period, with only the perihelion distance
deviating a little toward that of the 1843 sungrazer.

Several accounts of historical comets in Hasegawa’s
(1980) catalog between 1141 BC and 1201 BC (recorded
in Babylonia, Greece, Troy, and Assyria) and another
object between 1921 BC and 1950 BC (recorded in
Chaldea)14 — most copied from Pingr´e’s (1783) cometog-
raphy — led us to integrate the orbit from 372 BC back
in time over two revolutions about the Sun. While we felt
that there was no point in deriving ∆U shifts to bring the
computed perihelion times into better agreement with
the recorded times, it is clear that the diﬀerences of not
more than several decades would require fairly minor val-
ues of the shift corrections. One cannot rule out that es-
pecially the Greek comet seen either in 1176 or 1201 BC
and the one in the 20th century BC could have been
previous appearances of Aristotle’s comet.

The somewhat longer than expected period of time be-
tween Aristotle’s comet and the candidate objects in the
late 12th century BC is not surprising, if some of the
16 comets in Hasegawa’s catalog between 532 and 394 BC
were siblings of Aristotle’s comet whose birth dated back
to the 12th century BC. Although speculative, this argu-
ment is supported by six Kreutz candidates on Hasegawa
& Nakano’s (2001) list between AD 101 and 252, poten-
tially their next returns to perihelion.

14 Observations must have been made near the end of the Sume-
rian era; Chaldea existed in the same region about a millennium
or more later.

The agreement between the predicted perihelion time
of Aristotle’s comet and the alleged appearance of the
Sumerian comet, to better than 50 years is excellent given
the poor dating of those times. It suﬃces to mention that
the diﬀerence between two historical scales, the so-called
short and middle chronologies, is 64 years.

In any case, the Kreutz sungrazer system in our termi-
nology refers to fragments that were derived from either
Lobe I or Lobe II (or the neck, if it ever established
its own hierarchy of products) at or after the breakup
of Aristotle’s comet into the lobes at large heliocentric
distance about two millennia ago. Any sungrazers that
were given birth in the course of previous fragmentation
events involving Aristotle’s comet or its predecessor, dur-
ing which the object’s contact-binary nature remained
intact, are obviously related to the Kreutz sungrazers
by virtue of being derived from the common parent, but
they stay outside our area of interest.

8. COMMENTS ON POTENTIAL ORBITAL HISTORY OF
SUNGRAZING COMET PEREYRA

Next to the fragments of the Great September Comet
of 1882 and comet Ikeya-Seki, Pereyra (C/1963 R1) is
the only other major Kreutz sungrazer whose orbital pe-
riod is known with relatively high accuracy.15 Pereyra’s
osculating orbit (Marsden 1967, Marsden et al. 1978) was
classiﬁed by Marsden as Population (or Subgroup) I, even
though it does not resemble the orbit of the 1843 sun-
grazer as closely as does, for example, the Great South-
ern Comet of 1880 (C/1880 C1). The notable diﬀerence
is in the perihelion distance, which is about 10 percent
smaller and treacherously close to the Sun’s radius. Also,
Pereyra’s orbital period of 900 yr is longer than for any
other bright Kreutz sungrazer with a known period. Al-
though the comet was observed exclusively after peri-
helion,16 the derived orbital period is deemed relevant

15 Comet Lovejoy (C/2011 W3), whose orbital period has also
been determined rather accurately (Sekanina & Chodas 2012), dis-
integrated shortly after perihelion and we do not rank it as a major
Kreutz sungrazer.

16 The comet was discovered three weeks after perihelion.

to the comet’s preperihelion motion because its nucleus
apparently did not fragment.17

The odd orbital properties make Pereyra’s comet a
maverick that is diﬃcult to compartmentalize among the
bright Kreutz sungrazers. The long orbital period is par-
ticularly perplexing because it suggests the previous per-
ihelion about 50 years prior to the 1106 comet. Marsden
wrestled with the problem, noting an agreement between
the orbits of the 1843 and 1880 sungrazers at their pre-
vious return to perihelion when he assigned an orbital
period near 370 yr to the former— about one half the
period we adopt — and slightly over 400 yr to the lat-
ter. He combined the evolution of this pair with that
of comet Pereyra, whose orbital period was more than
twice as long. The solutions that Marsden deemed the
most promising required that the parent — which he
called the “Combo” — should have passed perihelion ei-
ther in mid-February 1072 when Pereyra separated and
in mid-March 1463 when the 1880 comet separated from
the 1843 comet; or in early December 1114 when Pereyra
separated and in late October 1487 for the second frag-
mentation event. The second solution — the more prob-
able one according to Marsden — implied for Pereyra a
barycentric orbital period of 849 yr, which was by nearly
60 yr shorter than the most probable value. As Mars-
den himself noted, no sungrazer was observed in either
1463 or 1487. One may add that none was seen in 1072
or 1114 either (see England 2002). Not to mention that
a subsequent revision of the orbit of the 1843 sungrazer
(Sekanina & Chodas 2008) ruled out the possibility of its
orbital period having been anywhere near 400 yr.

We have now revisited the issue of Pereyra’s sungrazer
by ﬁrst computing the time of its previous perihelion,
based on Marsden’s osculating elements. Our orbit in-
tegration showed that the perihelion time should have
occurred on 1057 April 7, so that its barycentric orbital
period was 906.4 yr. Marsden determined the orbital
period with a mean error of
17 yr. Accordingly, a per-
ihelion passage between the years 1040 and 1074 should
satisfy the predicted perihelion time within

1σ.

17 Roemer (1963, 1965) reported a possible secondary nucleus
0′.1 from the primary on 1963 November 9, nearly 80 days after
perihelion, which was never conﬁrmed. Its existence is highly un-
likely, because a genuine companion (i) should have been detected
much earlier and (ii) this long after perihelion the separation dis-
tance from the primary should have been substantially greater.

Hasegawa & Nakano (2001) have on their list of po-
tential Kreutz sungrazers an exceedingly bright Chinese-
Korean comet, allegedly of absolute magnitude
1, which
was to pass perihelion nominally on 1041 August 4. The
historical records noted that the comet was ﬁrst seen on
1041 September 1. We propose that Pereyra’s comet sep-
arated from this parent at its 1041 return to perihelion
and examine the ramiﬁcations of this hypothesis.

−

We integrated the gravitational orbit of Pereyra’s
comet, adjusted to ﬁt the perihelion of the 1041 comet,
and found that its previous perihelion would have oc-
curred on 158 November 11. While Hasegawa & Nakano
tabulate a possible Kreutz comet in January 133 and an-
other one in October 191, we prefer a linkage to Lobe I
in November 363, so that Pereyra would be its indirect,
second-generation product.

Table 21 shows that the proposed history of Pereyra’s
comet is entirely feasible. A notable feature is a rapid
rotation of the orbital plane: between 1041 and 363 the
nodal line advanced at an incredible rate of more than 8◦
per revolution. The sudden jump in the orbital period of
more than 200 yr was triggered by a radial shift of the
center of mass by less than 4 km at the 1041 perihelion,
when the comet was barely 40,000 km above the pho-
tosphere. The orbital elements at perihelion in AD 363
show that Pereyra’s precursor obviously separated from
Lobe I, as predicted in Papers 1 and 2, where it was re-
ferred to as Fragment Pe. The diﬀerences in the elements
relative to Lobe I are, however, much smaller than the
diﬀerences between Lobes I and II. For example, the gap
in the nodal longitude is 7◦ compared to 21◦, in the incli-
nation 0◦.8 compared to 3◦.8, and the perihelion distance
0.04 R⊙ compared to 0.7 R⊙.

Even though the gaps between the 363 orbital elements
of Lobe I and Pereyra’s precursor were much smaller
than between those of Lobes I an II, they were large
enough that obviously the precursor arrived at perihe-
lion in AD 363 as a separate fragment and that instead
of Lobe I’s path from the apparition of 363 to 1106 it fol-
lowed an alternative path to 1041. In other words, unlike
for other Population I fragments (such as C/1880 C1),
the orbital evolution of Pereyra became divorced from
that population’s parent already before the ﬁrst passage
through perihelion. This explains why comet Pereyra
was among Population I members a maverick: it was their
sibling, but a more distant sibling.

The reader may notice a remarkable similarity in the
time of the year between the arrivals of the 1041 comet
and the 1138 comet. The adopted perihelion dates dif-
fer by three days, the date of the ﬁrst observation by two
days. The length of the period of observation of the 1041
comet is disputed: the quoted Chinese source says more
than 90 days, while the Korean source says “20 and some
odd days,” a little less than for the 1138 comet. A large
uncertainty was obviously involved. The observations
of the 1138 comet were terminated, in part, because of
interference from moonlight, when the predicted appar-
ent magnitude was 4; after the observing conditions im-
proved, there evidently was nobody to pick up the comet
again. It seems that this happened with the 1041 comet
in Korea as well, given that the Moon phases were moved
forward one week in 1041 compared to 1138. Unlike the
Koreans, the Chinese must have observed the tail of the
1041 comet until its head was of apparent magnitude
7,
as prominent sungrazers sometimes have been (see Pa-
per 2). In any case, the head of the 1041 comet could

Adopting for this object the same post-perihelion rate

9. ARISTOTLE’S COMET: WHY A CONTACT BINARY

AND WHY APHELION BREAKUP?
Besides the arguments favoring the idea of a contact-
binary model for the progenitor that rely on the intrin-
sic properties of the Kreutz system and have been pre-
sented in Paper 1, this paradigm is likewise supported
by independent circumstantial evidence. Among the six
comets imaged at closeup by cameras on board space-
craft (1P/Halley, 19P/Borrelly, 81P/Wild, 9P/Tempel,
103P/Hartley, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko) and one
by radar (8P/Tuttle), the nuclei of at least two (8P, 67P)
were found to be bilobed, while the nuclei of 103P (de-
scribed as peanut-shaped) and perhaps even 1P and 19P
had similar outlines (e.g., Harmon et al. 2010, A’Hearn
et al. 2011, Jutzi & Asphaug 2015, Jorda et al. 2016).

Another line of evidence that generally corroborates
the contact-binary model is the existence of persisting
twin objects both among short-period comets (such as
3D/Biela, observed double at two consecutive returns to
perihelion) and among comets of longer period (such as
the pair of C/2002 A1 and C/2002 A2, both under ob-
servation over more than two years) as well as among the
Kuiper Belt objects (e.g., Goldreich et al. 2002), includ-
ing the Pluto–Charon pair.

Discovered several years ago, the Kuiper Belt object
(486958) Arrokoth = 2014 MU69 (a.k.a. Ultima Thule)
was imaged by the New Horizons Mission (Stern et al.
2019), oﬀering arguably the most robust piece of sup-
porting circumstantial evidence for at least two rea-
sons: (i) the overall length of this contact-binary object
equaled, according to Stern et al., 36 km and the larger,
highly-ﬂattened lobe’s maximum diameter was 22 km,
comparable to the crudely estimated dimensions of the
Great September Comet of 1882 (Sekanina 2002), a ma-
jor surviving mass of the presumed Kreutz progenitor;
and (ii) the likelihood that contact binaries like Arrokoth
are common among transneptunian objects in general
and Kuiper Belt objects in particular, a notion expressed
independently by several researchers (e.g., Rickman et al.
2015, Stern et al. 2019, Benecchi et al. 2019). Contact-
binary objects are believed to have initially been separate
objects orbiting about one another at very low velocities
(a few meters per second), eventually collapsing gravita-
tionally into a single body (e.g., Stern et al. 2019, Grundy
et al. 2020, McKinnon et al. 2020).

Extending this rationale to its seemingly logical con-
clusion, one would argue that the Kreutz progenitor was
a Kuiper Belt object. Unfortunately, since Kuiper Belt
objects are not perturbed into retrograde orbits, this hy-
pothesis has to be abandoned. Instead, a plausible re-
gion of origin could be the inner Oort Cloud, the source
of Halley-type comets (Levison et al. 2001). Inner Oort
Cloud objects may have an aﬃnity for forming contact
binaries like Kuiper Belt objects, although the lower spa-
tial density oﬀers a less favorable environment. Once the
progenitor enters — presumably thanks to mostly indi-
rect perturbations by the outer planets, Jupiter in par-
ticular — an orbit that is inclined 90◦ to 100◦ to the
ecliptic and has an orbital period of
800 yr and peri-
helion distance of less than 2 AU, a process of migration

governed by continuing long-term indirect planetary per-
turbations was shown by Bailey et al. (1992) to have been
progressively reducing the perihelion distance over a pe-
riod on the order of a million years, injecting eventually
the object into the observed retrograde sungrazing orbit.
Fern´andez et al. (2021) have recently considered three
diﬀerent models for the Kreutz system progenitor, con-
cluding that the most promising one was an Oort-Cloud
comet, which was ﬁrst injected into an Earth-crossing
orbit and then perturbed into a sungrazing orbit by the
Lidov-Kozai mechanism. While this model has some at-
tractive features, it wrestles with the problem of a rate at
which such massive objects could be delivered into these
orbits. The study does not address the issue of discrete
populations of sungrazer fragments and deals only with
near-perihelion tidally-triggered fragmentation.

There indeed is a universal consensus that the Sun’s
tidal forces, possibly in concert with other forces, insti-
gate perihelion fragmentation of the Kreutz comets. One
such other potential trigger is the Sun’s extreme heat
that foments stress because of the propagation of a ther-
mal wave through the nucleus, unless massive amounts
of ejected dust in the atmosphere make it optically thick,
thereby protecting the nucleus from direct exposure.
These eﬀects are of course superposed on presumably less
robust eﬀects of the nucleus’ rotation and/or precession.
This conclusion is based on a plausible premise that
a nucleus breaks up, if stress in its interior, induced by
the Sun tidally, and potentially exacerbated thermally,
exceeds the strength of the nucleus. It is ﬁtting to ask
what happens if the magnitude of the combined tidal,
thermal, and rotational stresses does not exceed the nu-
cleus strength. One expects that the object then survives
perihelion passage, though not necessarily intact : some,
however minor, damage is being sustained at each close
approach to the Sun and the extent of this damage adds
up, revolution after revolution. Indeed, the egress of a
sungrazer out of the solar corona is always anticipated
with some trepidation over its survival. The observations
oﬀer only one of three answers: (i) the object emerges
with a single nuclear condensation, in which case it is
said to have survived; or (ii) it emerges with two or more
condensations, indicating that its nucleus split; or (iii) it
emerges with no condensation, the sign of disintegration.
What remains hidden in the case of survival is the extent
of damage: the observations do not discriminate between
a structurally intact, nearly intact, moderately damaged,
or heavily damaged (but still unbroken) nucleus.

Although hidden to the observers, the genuine physical
condition of the nucleus at the end of its extremely close
approach to the Sun’s photosphere makes all the diﬀer-
ence in the comet’s future life. An intact or nearly intact
object is obviously much more likely to successfully com-
plete the hundreds-of-years lasting revolution about the
Sun than an object that barely held together at the start
of the long journey. The gradual weakening of structural
cohesion of a piece of material under terrestrial condi-
tions (on vastly shorter time scales) is known as material
fatigue; there is no reason why the process could not
apply, on another time scale, to objects in space as well.
When the celestial object is a contact binary, the neck
is likely to be more susceptible to damage than the
lobes. In general, the neck is subjected to either com-
pressive or tensile stress, depending on the size and mass

(and thus the density) of the lobes as well as the rate
of rotation. The magnitude of the force also depends
on the cross-sectional area of the neck. For Arrokoth,
McKinnon et al. (2020) determined that the neck was
being subjected to compression if the object’s density
was greater than 0.25 g cm−3, which was likely to be
the case. Judging from the estimated giant size of the
nucleus of C/1882 R1, the neck of the proposed Kreutz
progenitor should have been subjected to an even higher
level of compressive stress, unless the rotation was much
faster than Arrokoth’s.

∼

∼

Except in the Sun’s proximity, the force aﬀecting the
Kreutz progenitor’s neck should not have changed mate-
rially over the period of time from the instance of gentle
merger of the two lobes until after the process of the ob-
ject’s slow migration into the sungrazing orbit was long
underway. Bailey et al.’s (1992) computations suggest
that the perihelion distance had dropped to
0.1 AU ap-
proximately 50 revolutions and to
0.01 AU some 25 rev-
olutions about the Sun before the minimum distance
was reached. While the object was repeatedly — every
700–800 years or so — approaching the Sun in an orbit
whose perihelion distance followed this downward spiral,
the near-perihelion environment was subjecting the neck
to three cyclic eﬀects that were gradually accumulating
from orbit to orbit and, as a result, weakening the bond
between the pair of lobes: two such eﬀects, as already
noted, were, respectively, tensile stress, prompted by the
Sun’s tidal force, and thermal stress, triggered by an
enormous heat pulse, both strongly perihelion-distance
dependent; a third was an imprint of similarly varying
rates of vigorous sublimation of volatile substances from
the neck, thereby reducing its cross-sectional area with
time.

The neck of the bilobed Kreutz progenitor is thus pre-
sumed to have been subjected to an essentially constant
load, with dozens of overlapping cyclic stress peaks cen-
tered, once every 700–800 years, on the time of perihe-
lion, the magnitude of which was growing progressively
from orbit to next orbit as the perihelion distance was
steadily decreasing toward the presumed present value
slightly exceeding 1 R⊙. It is this cyclic component of
the load that represents what one can refer to as an ex-
treme case of the already noted material fatigue, even
though the duration of the cycle is vastly longer and the
number of cycles orders of magnitude lower than in ap-
plications to fabricated materials, metals in particular,
under usual terrestrial conditions.

In summary, fatigue of material is a process of progres-
sive, localized deformation and/or weakening in an ob-
ject subjected to a cyclic load below the static material
strength, which prompts the development, growth, and
propagation of cracks from cycle to cycle, culminating
fatigue failure (see, e.g.,
in the object’s fracture, a.k.a.
Suresh 2014). Since fatigue is an irreversible stochastic
process with a degree of randomness, the lifetime, deﬁned
by the number of cycles to failure, is rather poorly deter-
mined, especially in the presence of an appreciable back-
ground stress. Usually associated with tensile stresses,
fatigue has several phases, but most time is consumed in
the crack growth phase. Once a crack has begun, each
loading cycle enlarges the crack by a small amount until
it reaches a critical point when the stress intensity factor
of the crack exceeds the fracture toughness of the mate-

30

rial producing its rapid propagation that nearly instantly
completes the fracture.

Because of the limited number of orbits with perihelia
very close to the Sun during the orbital evolution, the
neck of the Kreutz progenitor was exposed to low-cycle
105). And since
fatigue (when the number of cycles is
the location of the point of failure is essentially random
in time, the location of aphelion close to 160 AU from the
50 precent chance of frac-
Sun implies that there is a
ture at heliocentric distances >140 AU, a
60 percent
chance at >130 AU, a
70 percent chance at >110 AU,
80 percent chance at >90 AU from the Sun. Ac-
and an
∼
cordingly, the probability of breakup at large heliocentric
distance is high.

It is noted that fragmentation events at arbitrary (and
generally large) distances from the Sun coexist with
events of perihelion fragmentation because of strongly
heterogeneous structure and morphology of the nuclei:
the former incidents are their response to an accumu-
lated eﬀect of cyclic episodes of deformation, the magni-
tude of which is smaller than a fracture limit , whereas
the latter occurrences are their response to discrete in-
stances of damage whose magnitudes reach or exceed a
relevant fracture limit . Accordingly, while new dam-
age (cracks initiation) is always inﬂicted over a short
period of time around perihelion, the ultimate response
(completed cracks propagation) may or may not be con-
strained to this orbital arc, depending on the magnitude
of the injury. Hence, a Kreutz sungrazer may fragment
at any point of the orbit, including aphelion.

10. CONCLUSIONS
In broad terms, the purpose of this paper was to con-
duct a feasibility study in support of the contact-binary
model for the orbital history of the Kreutz sungrazer sys-
tem. While the problem potentially has a large number
of solutions, each of which satisﬁes a set of boundary con-
ditions, our task was to demonstrate that the particular
solution that we chose to pursue was one of them. Our
approach was based on the assumption that the largest
surviving masses of the two lobes of the contact-binary
progenitor were the Great March Comet of 1843 (Lobe I)
and the Great September Comet of 1882 (Lobe II), as-
sociated with Populations I and II, respectively. We ac-
cepted Marsden’s (1967) result on the undisputed genetic
connection of the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki’s comet,
which separated from their common parent at the previ-
ous perihelion passage.

We settled the notorious, protracted dispute over the
position of the Great Comet of 1106 in the hierarchy of
the Kreutz system. We developed a new technique for de-
riving the time of the previous return of Ikeya-Seki’comet
to perihelion, based on linking the 1965 preperihelion
astrometric observations with the early post-perihelion
ones. The evidence pointed unequivocally to the conclu-
sion that the comet was at perihelion around the year
1139, more than three decades after the appearance of
the 1106 comet. A close relationship between the 1106
comet on the one hand and Ikeya-Seki (and the 1882 sun-
grazer) on the other hand was thus ruled out. By con-
trast, we see no obstacle for accepting the 1106 comet as
the previous appearance of the Great March Comet of
1843, supported by the orbital computations by Sekanina
& Chodas (2008).

We also settled the other tenacious problem, previously
brought up by Marsden (1989): Should there have been
a second parent comet in the early 12th century to ac-
count for two populations (or subgroups) of the Kreutz
sungrazers? In the case we deal with here, this presents a
dilemma: Where was the parent comet of the 1882/1965
pair, if it was not the 1106 comet? Our — ﬁrst ever
— reference to the Chinese comet of 1138 as the pair’s
parent did: (i) answer the above question; (ii) show the
time of its appearance consistent with the prediction
from our analysis of comet Ikeya-Seki; (iii) turn out to
be in excellent agreement with Marsden’s (1967) predic-
tion of the previous appearance of the 1882 sungrazer;
(iv) substantially improve the orbital agreement between
the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki in comparison with
Marsden’s (1967) results for their assumed common ori-
gin in 1115; and (v) demonstrate that an intrinsically
bright Kreutz sungrazer that was at perihelion in early
August and unobserved in broad daylight, was not nec-
essarily missed, as was often claimed in the literature.

We are rather conﬁdent that the Chinese comet of 1138
was the 12th-century “missing” major sungrazer, even
though we admit that our arguments are unfortunately
based on a minimum amount of data. Comparison with
the naked-eye’s limiting magnitude for stellar objects
showed that this comet’s post-perihelion intrinsic bright-
ness was apparently greater than that of the 1843 sun-
grazer and could have been comparable to the brightness
of the 1882 sungrazer. Its apparent brightness suﬀered
from extremely unfavorable geometric conditions during
the object’s departure from perihelion on the far side of
the Sun. The description of this comet (Ho 1962) is sim-
ilar to the account, in a Korean source, of a suspected
Kreutz sungrazer of 1041 (Hasegawa & Nakano 2001),
which appeared at the same time of the year.

Two modes of orbit integration that we applied in an
eﬀort to link consecutive returns of the Kreutz sungraz-
ers to perihelion were referred to as, respectively, a sub-
limation scenario and a fragmentation scenario. In the
ﬁrst mode the orbital period was being aﬀected contin-
uously by an outgassing-driven nongravitational acceler-
ation, requiring no fragmentation. The other mode was
applicable only in the presence of near-perihelion tidally-
driven fragmentation, requiring no nongravitational ef-
fects; the orbital period was altered suddenly. A parent’s
breakup essentially along a plane perpendicular to the
radius vector resulted in the generation of two or more
fragments whose centers of mass were located at slightly
diﬀerent heliocentric distances relative to the parent’s
center of mass, yet at the time of breakup they had the
same orbital velocity. The fragments, with no momen-
tum exchange involved, were thus bound to end up in
diﬀerent orbits; the period was the longer the farther
from the Sun was the center of mass. The enormity of
this eﬀect at perihelion in sungrazing orbits is illustrated
by noting that a shift of one kilometer (a few percent
of the size of a major sungrazer’s nucleus) in the radial
40 yr.
direction could easily change a 700 yr period by
The Kreutz sungrazers are of course subjected to both
modes of orbit transformation, and comet Ikeya-Seki was
an example on which the interaction between them was
illustrated. We showed that at the time of tidal splitting
fragment B was at the sunward end of the parent nucleus
and its orbital period would have been shorter than that

of the main fragment A, if it were not subjected to a sig-
niﬁcant nongravitational acceleration. Accordingly, the
orbital period of the parent was shorter than that of frag-
ment A. This explains why the back integration of the
orbit of this fragment indicates the previous perihelion
around the year 1115, while the comet actually passed
perihelion (as part of its own parent comet) more than
20 years later.

We did not mix the two modes of orbit integration,
the sublimation and fragmentation scenarios, in our orbit
simulation computations. We demonstrated that either
of them successfully linked the three returns of the largest
surviving masses of Lobe I, 1843–1106–363, and Lobe II,
1882–1138–363, even though the sublimation scenario re-
quired an improbably high nongravitational acceleration
to accomplish the linkage for Lobe II. The fragmenta-
tion scenario did not need center-of-mass shifts greater
than a few kilometers at perihelion, deemed very mod-
est and quite acceptable. For Lobe II we described the
sequence of two fragmentation events in the year 1138:
in the primary event at perihelion the arriving parent,
presumed to have been more than 60 km across, shed
a minor fragment into an orbit of long period, while its
major fragment split tidally again, about 2.5 hr later,
into the 1882 sungrazer and Ikeya-Seki’s comet.

In connection with the sublimation scenario we point
out that the current computer techniques, aiming to
account for variations in the nongravitational accelera-
tion whose eﬀects are asymmetric relative to perihelion,
are inadequate and need a conceptual upgrade. Reﬁned
methods should unquestionably have a favorable eﬀect on
simulating the orbital evolution of the Kreutz sungrazers
in the future.

While the sublimation scenario failed to ﬁt the sun-
grazers’ orbital changes prior to AD 363, the fragmenta-
tion scenario — even without the beneﬁt of incorporat-
ing any nongravitational motion — allowed us to set up
a method of successfully simulating the orbits of Lobes I
and II toward their point of birth, essentially at aphe-
lion previous to the perihelion passage in AD 363. We
adopted a default perihelion time of 363 Nov 15.0 (which
was a convenient standard to which the arriving sungraz-
ers’ orbits were referred to rather than the actual time of
perihelion passage) and computed for either lobe a frag-
mentation scenario based gravitational orbit that linked
its perihelion time in AD 363 with the perihelion time
expected for Aristotle’s comet — the proposed contact-
binary progenitor — in 372 BC. It turned out that the
line of intersection of the orbital planes of the lobes, on
which they had to be located at the time of their sep-
aration from the common parent, made such extremely
small angles with the lobes’ lines of apsides that the as-
sumption of a breakup at aphelion was bound to be a
very good approximation.

With this aphelion breakup of Aristotle’s comet set at
the very end of 5 BC at a heliocentric distance of 163 AU,
we further assumed that the two lobes were of equal di-
mensions, separating with equal velocities in the opposite
directions, and that the progenitor was spinning along
an axis pointing at the Sun. The radial component of
the separation velocity was then nil, while the transverse
component determined the perihelion distances as well as
perihelion times of the lobes and the normal component
governed the spatial positions of their orbital planes. A

separation velocity of 3.63 m s−1 ﬁtted the angular el-
ements to about 0◦.3, demonstrating that the existence
of the two major populations of the Kreutz system as
the product of fragmentation of a progenitor comet at
large heliocentric distance is feasible and fundamentally
correct. The procedure also resulted in a predicted set
of orbital elements for Aristotle’s comet.

In the light of the well-known diﬃculties that eﬀorts
to compartmentalize the orbital characteristics of the
Kreutz comet discovered by Pereyra in 1963 had pro-
voked in the past, we oﬀer a novel explanation to the
oddities of this maverick sungrazer. With its derived pe-
riod exceeding 900 yr, a plausible previous appearance
was the comet of 1041 that passed perihelion in early Au-
gust according to Hasegawa & Nakano (2001), a case of
interest in its own right. Integration of Pereyra’s motion
suggests that its precursor had separated from Lobe I
already before the perihelion passage in AD 363. This
circumstance allowed Pereyra’s comet to bypass the nor-
mal evolutionary path for members of Population I via
the Great Comet of 1106 and instead to follow an alterna-
tive path via the comet of 1041. This example illustrates
the diversity of orbital tracks that the Kreutz sungrazers
could heed, thus explaining the large number of discrete
populations presented in Paper 1.

The Kreutz sungrazers are still believed to fragment
mostly at close proximity of perihelion due to the Sun’s
tidal forces. This may very well be true. However, the
existence of discrete populations of fragments with large
gaps between their angular elements and perihelion dis-
tances cannot be a product of perihelion fragmentation,
alone or enhanced with eﬀects of the indirect planetary
perturbations over periods of time that are not exces-
sively long. We argue that the sungrazers are in fact
subject to fragmentation along the entire orbit around
the Sun, including aphelion, because of material fatigue
of their nuclei. The perihelion region is where a Kreutz
sungrazer is exposed to a cyclic load, whose magnitude
is below the static material strength, yet it prompts the
growth and propagation of cracks, resulting eventually
in fatigue failure. This condition is reached randomly,
at an arbitrary time. Since sungrazers spend most time
at large heliocentric distance, fatigue fracture far from
the Sun is likely. The probability for a rotating contact-
binary Kreutz sungrazer may further be augmented by
continuous rotation stress and the potentially brittle na-
ture of the connecting neck.

KREUTZ’S ORBIT FOR PRIMARY FRAGMENT OF
THE GREAT SEPTEMBER COMET OF 1882

Because the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden
& Williams (2008) lists for the 1882 sungrazer’s primary
nucleus (fragment B or No. 2) the relativistic orbit by
Hufnagel (1919), Kreutz’s (1891) deﬁnitive nonrelativis-

tic orbit for this fragment, converted to equinox J2000,
is not widely accessible. The purpose here is to alleviate
this problem. The following set of orbital elements is
that published by Kreutz on page 35 of his Paper II, but
updated using current conventions:

(1) Equinox 1882.0, employed by Kreutz, has been re-

placed by J2000.

(2) Berlin Mean Time has been converted to Universal
Time by adding 12 hr and subtracting the longitude of
Berlin Observatory (IAU code 548; active 1835–1913),
0h53m34s.93 east of Greenwich (Gould 1853). Universal
Time has then been converted to Terrestrial Time (TT)
5s.20 from Astronomical
by adding a correction ∆T of

Almanac’s online tabular data,18 based on the work by
Stephenson & Morrison (1984).

(3) The orbit was integrated from Kreutz’s osculation
epoch of 1882 Sept 20.5 Berlin Mean Time to a standard
osculation epoch of 1882 Oct 2.0 TT = JD 2408720.5.

(4) The probable errors of the elements used by Kreutz
have been converted to the mean errors by applying a
multiplication factor of 1.4826.

(5) A typographical error that we detected in Kreutz’s
paper has been corrected. It aﬀected the published value
of eccentricity, which was inconsistent with the listed
logarithm of eccentricity as well as with the ratio of the
perihelion distance to semimajor axis.

The elements are based on 18 normal places in right
ascension and declination (between 1882 Sept 8 and 1883
Mar 3), on an observation of the comet’s ingress on the
Sun’s disk on 1882 Sept 17, and on 13 normal places in
the coordinate perpendicular to the nuclear line (between
1882 Oct 1 and 1883 May 26). The 32 normal places, of
which only ﬁve were preperihelion ones, were made up of
a total of slightly more than 600 individual astrometric
observations, extending over 260 days, from 1882 Sept 8
through 1883 May 26. The mean residual for a normal

It is interesting that in his ﬁrst paper Kreutz (1888)
considered the No. 2 fragment to have been a “center-
of-gravity” of the disintegrated nucleus, because he was
able to successfully link the preperihelion observations of
the single nucleus with the post-perihelion observations
of this fragment. At the time he anticipated that no
other fragment would provide a similarly satisfactory
linkage, but after convincing himself, in his second paper
(Kreutz 1891), that the fragments Nos. 3 and 4 did as
well, he changed his mind and concluded that the center
of gravity could have been located anywhere along the
nuclear train between the fragments Nos. 2 and 4. This

led him to maintain that the comet’s pre-fragmentation
orbital period was between 770 and about 1000 years.
Yet, it appears that he attached more weight to the lower
limit, which follows from the fact that in his third and
ﬁnal paper (Kreutz 1901) he returned to the problem
of the comet of 1106. Even though he did mention
suggestions by some astronomers that this comet might
have been an earlier appearance of the 1843 sungrazer,
Kreutz’s preference in favor of the identity between the
1882 and 1106 comets based on the latter’s daytime
observations gets across as substantial.
