ABSTRACT

We studied light curves of GJ 1243, YZ CMi, and V374 Peg, observed by TESS for the presence
of stellar spots and stellar ﬂares. One of the main goals was to model light curves of spotted stars to
estimate the number of spots along with their parameters using our original BASSMAN software. The
modeled light curves were subtracted from the observations to increase eﬃciency of ﬂare detection.
Flares were detected automatically with our new dedicated software WARPFINDER. We estimated the
presence of two spots on GJ 1243 with mean temperature about 2800 K and spottedness varying
between 3% − 4% of the stellar surface and two spots on V374 Peg with a mean temperature of about
3000 K and spottedness about 6% of the stellar surface. On YZ CMi we found two diﬀerent models for
two light curves separated in time by one and a half year. One of them is three-spot model with mean
temperature of about 3000 K and spottedness of star about 9% of the stellar surface. The second is a
four-spot model with mean temperature about 2800 K and spottedness about 7% of the stellar surface.
We tested whether the ﬂares are distributed homogeneously in phase and if there is any correlation
between the presence of spots and the distribution of ﬂares. For YZ CMi one spot is in anticorrelation
with the distribution of the ﬂares and for GJ 1243 shows non-homogeneous distribution of ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION

Many low-mass main sequence stars show ﬂaring and spot activity similar to or even much higher than the solar
activity (Yang et al. 2017; Howard et al. 2019; G¨unther et al. 2020). The most probable explanation of this phenomenon
is that these stars, due to being fully convective (Reid & Hawley 2005) or having a convective layer in upper parts of
the interior, show the presence of magnetic dynamo. This phenomenon can be responsible for the presence of stellar
spots and magnetic reconnection that is the main mechanism of energy release in stellar ﬂares (Hilton et al. 2011; Lin
et al. 2019).

Starspots are phenomena created by local magnetic ﬁelds on the surface of the stars. The magnetic ﬁeld of these spots
is strong enough to block or redirect energy transport. The spots, as being cooler than the surrounding photosphere,
appear dark (Biermann 1941; Hoyle 1949; Chitre 1963; Bray & Loughhead 1964; Deinzer 1965; Dicke 1970). The term
,,starspot” does not strictly mean one sunspot-like structure, but can often be an active region consisting of several
individual spots. There is no way to distinguish between these cases from light curves. The presence of starspots
causes periodic modulations in the stellar light curve, which are larger in amplitude if the starspots are larger or
darker (Strassmeier 2009).

Stellar ﬂares are highly energetic, rapid events that occur during magnetic reconnection in the coronae of stars.
Non-potential magnetic energy is released/converted into other forms of energy during a very short time. Radiation of
stellar ﬂares can be seen across the whole electromagnetic spectrum (from gamma rays to radio emission). During the
impulsive phase of ﬂares beams of non-thermal electrons are accelerated somewhere in the solar or stellar corona and
are streaming along magnetic ﬁeld lines towards the chromosphere, where they heat by collision dense matter near the
feet of the loops. At the same moment the huge amount of energy is emitted away from the feet of the loop in the
whole electromagnetic spectrum which can be observed as a temporary variation of the emission of the star.

Bicz et al.

The optical emission of solar ﬂares consists of continuum and spectral lines. The intensity of continuum does not
increase noticeably during the majority of solar ﬂares, while the intensity of spectral lines, formed mainly in the
solar chromosphere and the transition region (TR), may increase signiﬁcantly. Assuming the photospheric origin
of white-light ﬂare emission, the most probable mechanisms of continuum brightening is H− emission (Ding et al.
1994).
It is possible that the photosphere is not heated directly by non-thermal particles but during the process
of ”radiative backwarming” where the non-thermal electrons deposit their energy in the chromosphere and then,
the hotter chromosphere radially heats the lower-lying photosphere (Fang & Ding 1995). More recent studies show
that the ﬂare continuum emission can be formed in the thin ”layer” of the chromosphere in the process of hydrogen
recombination (Potts et al. 2010).

Flare duration usually varies from minutes to hours, with a fast rise and an exponential decay. The typical ﬂares
energies from 1026 to 1032 erg (the largest measured energies even up to 1036 erg) (Shibayama et al. 2013). Flare
activity is thought to be correlated with fast stellar rotation and the late spectral type. About 40% of M-dwarfs are
ﬂaring stars (Yang et al. 2017; G¨unther et al. 2020; Howard et al. 2019). Moreover, detecting ﬂares on late-type stars
is easier due to the higher ﬂare contrast caused by the lower surface temperature.

In this paper, we present our analysis of the starspots and the ﬂare activity for GJ 1243, YZ CMi, and V374 Peg
using light curves from TESS and we compare the results with the earlier published papers. We estimated a number
of spots on each star, their parameters (temperature, size, stellar longitude and latitude). We compare compare the
eﬃcency of ﬂare detection before and after subtraction of the modulation eﬀect. Then we tested whether the ﬂares are
distributed homogeneously in phase and if there is any correlation between the presence of spots and the distribution
of ﬂares. In Section 2 we describe the used TESS observations and in Section 3 we elaborate on our software and
methodology. Our methods of detection of ﬂares are explained in Section 4. The results are presented and compared
with the previous papers in Section 5, and a discussion and conclusions are provided in Section 6.

2. OBSERVATIONS

In our analysis, we used observations from TESS (The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) (Ricker et al. 2014).
TESS is a space-based telescope launched in April 2018 and placed in a highly elliptical orbit with a period of 13.7 days.
The main goal of the mission is to provide continuous observations of a large part of the celestial sphere divided into
26 sectors. The satellite monitors target stars with a cadence of two minutes (short cadence) and a with a cadence
of 20 seconds (fast cadence) over the ∼ 27 days monitoring period in each sector. It is also possible to get the light
curve from the Full Frame Images (FFI) with 30-min cadence. To keep the consistency in analysis of the light curves
we used the two-minute cadence light curves with the quality ﬂag set to 0 to ensure the highest ﬁdelity data possible.

3. STARSPOTS MODELING

Modern observation techniques provide many tools to analyze the distribution of spots on stars. Observing variability
of stars’ light curves using photometry allow us to model the distribution of starspots or creating temperature maps of
the stellar surfaces (Amado et al. 2000; Savanov & Dmitrienko 2011, 2018; G¨unther & Daylan 2021). Another tool is
spectroscopy, where almost all information comes from the analysis of the spectra. It is possible to recreate distribution
of starspots and the distribution of the magnetic ﬁelds on a surface of a star using Doppler Imaging (Strassmeier 1990;
Arzoumanian et al. 2011; Boehm et al. 2020). Polarimetry is the third method of analyzing the starspots. Here, the
polarization state of radiation provides far more astrophysical information than intensity alone and can be the most
direct way to detect and study stellar magnetic ﬁelds using the measurements of the Stokes parameters (Valenti et al.
1995; Johns-Krull & Valenti 1996). Furthermore, there is also the interferometry method used in modeling spots. This
can be a powerful technique to measure the inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces. The direct observations of starspots
will be the key constraints for models of stellar activity (Wittkowski et al. 2002; Jankov et al. 2003; Rousselet-Perraut
et al. 2004). Last, but not least there is also the microlensing observation technique, where starspots generally produce
a clear signature only for transit events (Guinan et al. 1997; Heyrovsk´y & Sasselov 2000; Hendry et al. 2002). Moreover,
it provides an opportunity for probing starspots on the surfaces of slow-rotating stars, which are unsuitable candidates
for the Doppler Imaging technique.

To model the starspots on selected stars, we used photometrical observations from the TESS satellite and the
BASSMAN software (Best rAndom StarSpots Model calculAtioN). The software is written in Python 3 (van Rossum &
Drake 2009), by K. Bicz, and designed to model starspots on a stellar surface by using its observational light curve.
The algorithm is presented in Figure 1. BASSMAN recreates a light curve of a spotted star by ﬁtting a spot(s) model

to data. The code uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to ﬁt amplitudes, sizes, stellar longitudes and latitudes
of the spot(s). The program uses numerous ready-made software packages: starry (Luger et al. 2019), matplotlib
(Hunter 2007), numpy (Harris et al. 2020), scipy (Virtanen et al. 2020), PyMC3 (Salvatier et al. 2016), exoplanet
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2020), theano (Theano Development Team 2016), pillow (Clark 2015), tqdm (da Costa-Luis
et al. 2021), and corner (Foreman-Mackey 2016).

Any surface map can be expressed as a linear combination of spherical harmonics, provided that one goes to
suﬃciently high degree in the expansion. Knowing this and using package starry, the stars are described by the
vector of spherical harmonic coeﬃcients, which is indexed by increasing degree l and m order. By default, l = 30 and
m varies from −l to l. Each spot on that map is presented by the spherical harmonic expansion of a gaussian, with
an assumption that the spot is spherical. The coeﬃcients of the spherical harmonics by default have such values that
allow the total ﬂux of the star to be normalized to 1 (in TESS observations normalized ﬂux of non-spotted star can
diﬀer from 1). The normalized ﬂux of the star is called in this paper an amplitude of the star.

The program needs the inclination angle i of the rotation to the line of sight to model the observed light curve. If the
inclination is not given, then the program tries to estimate it by using apparent rotational velocity v sin(i), the radius
R of the star, and the star’s rotation period Prot. The relation between the described parameters and the inclination
is given by:

i = arcsin

(cid:18) v sin(i) · Prot
2πR∗

(cid:19)

(1)

We conducted tests on the assumed model of a star and its light curve with the known inclination to check if the
dispersion of data in the light curve has an impact on the restored model of starspots. Following that, we conﬁrmed
that the light curve dispersion does aﬀect the size of the spots, and to a small extent, the location of the spot’s center.
Tests have shown that if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the analyzed light curve is not lower than 86, then it is
possible to reproduce the assumed model with high accuracy. If it falls below the SNR = 52, then the reproduced
spot sizes are larger than the model spots. For even lower, below SNR = 26, then the positions of the spots’ also show
shifts from the original ones.

One of the issues with the single color photometry is that there exists a degeneracy between spot contrast and size.
Therefore, when preparing the BASSMAN code, we decided to operate with the amplitude of the spot instead of contrast.
The spot’s amplitude is well deﬁned by the range of the light curve variations. The spot’s size is manifested by the
time length of it’s ingress and egress from the visible side of the star.

For every star, BASSMAN assumes the quadratic limb darkening law described as follows:

I(µ)
I(1)

= 1 − a(1 − µ) − b(1 − µ)2

(2)

where I(1) is the intensity at the center of the disk, the µ is given by cos(ν), where ν is the angle between the line of
sight and the outward surface normal. Parameters a and b are limb darkening coeﬃcients for the TESS satellite for
star’s Teﬀ , log(g) and an assumed solar metallicity (parameters were estimated by Claret, A. (2017)).

If a rotation period of a star is not given in catalogs, we estimate it by taking the period with maximal power value
from the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982). BASSMAN can also recreate the model of a spotted
star with diﬀerential rotation, assuming that it can be described as follows:

Ω(θ) = Ωeq

(cid:0)1 − α sin2(θ)(cid:1)

(3)

where rotation of the star Ω on diﬀerent latitudes θ depends on a parameter α (α ∈ [0, 1]), an astrographic latitude
and a rotation velocity on the equator of the star Ωeq.

After recreating spots on a given star, BASSMAN tries to linearly estimate the temperature of each spot using the

following relation:

Tspot = γT∗

(4)

where γ is a ratio of a mean signal inside the spot to the signal on uspotted surface.

As depicted in Figure 1, we start our calculations with default or proposed parameters of a star and its spots. The
parameters of the star that we need are: a rotation period, a radius, temperature, and v sin(i) or i. If v sin(i) is given
instead of i then we try to estimate the inclination of the star by using Equation 1. The parameters of the spots
assumed by default in the software are the following:

• amplitude ([−0.1, 0.0])

• size ([0%, 5%])

• latitude ([−90◦, 90◦])

• longitude ([−180◦, 180◦])

The amplitude of the spot provides information on the amount of ﬂux that the spot can take from the star. The size
gives us the percentage of the surface of a star that is covered by the spot. The latitude and longitude tell us about
the latitude and longitude of the center of the spot. During light curve modeling starspots are assumed to be static.
The only parameter that vary in time due to rotation is the longitude of the spot.

In the next step, the program creates a spotless star object with amplitude of the star given by user, the limb
darkening, the rotation period and the inclination. This numerical model will be later called the PyMC3 model.
The amplitude of the star is the integrated ﬂux from the star when there is no spot on a visible side of the star.
After creating the mentioned object, the software checks if the spot model is provided. If yes, then BASSMAN reads the
amplitudes, the sizes, the latitudes, and longitudes. If a user does not provide these, then the program randomly draws
parameters of spots in selected or default ranges. Following that, the code checks if diﬀerential rotation modeling is
active. If yes, then the program reads α provided by user or randomly draws the value of α in a selected or a default
range.

When the software has all necessary parameters, then it positions the spots on the star and attempts to ﬁt the
model to given observational data. It does so by using the scipy tools to correct model parameters. When the ﬁtting
is complete, we try to estimate, using correlation coeﬃcients, if the model ﬁts the observations well enough. If the
outcomes are not achieved, then the program draws diﬀerent set of parameters and tries to ﬁt them to the data again.
If the ﬁtting is still unsatisfactory after a certain number of converged models, then the program increases the maximal
values of estimators needed to ﬁt the light curve. If this also does not produce the necessary results, then the software
increases the number of spots by one. These steps are repeated until the result ﬁts to the data or the number of spots
exceeds its maximal default of 10. After reaching more than the maximal number of spots, the program ends. If in
some case two models with diﬀerent number of spots ﬁts well to the observations user has to evaluate which ﬁt is
more realistic. During this evaluation we checked if the spots are not distributed symmetrically near the poles or if
the spots do not overlap. Additionally, we checked if the additional spot is not a very small one located very close
to the other spot, so they can be approximated by one spot. We also check if the spots’ parameters agree with the
solutions from equations 5 and 6. Also, we compare the goodness of ﬁt (GOF) of individual models. To do so we use
the log-probability. The higher the value of the log-probability, the better a model ﬁts a dataset.

BASSMAN calculates also a mean temperature of spots on a star using the following analytical relation (Notsu et al.

2019):

and estimates the spots coverage as follows (Notsu et al. 2013; Shibata et al. 2013):

were Aspot/Astar is a percentage spottedness of the star, ∆F/F is the normalized amplitude of light variations, Tspot is
a mean temperature of spots estimated from Equation 5, and Teﬀ is the eﬀective temperature of the star. We compare
these parameters with results achieved by BASSMAN.

In the next step, when the sampling is active, BASSMAN may start to sample over spots parameters using Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). MCMC is a class of algorithms used to approximate the posterior distribution of given
parameters by random sampling of data in a probabilistic space. By using MCMC, we can ﬁnd the best solution of
the spots’ model.

We prepared the software WARPFINDER (Wroc(cid:32)law AlgoRithm Prepared For detectINg anD analyzing stEllar ﬂaRes),
written in both IDL (Interactive Data Language) and Python 3 to detect and analyze ﬂares on a given star. The

assumptions and ideas of the algorithm were developed by R. Falewicz, M. Siarkowski, M. Pietras, and K. Bicz.
This software downloads every possible information about analyzed star from MAST (Barbara A. Mikulski Archive
for Space Telescopes), SIMBAD, and observational data from TESS satellite. Furthermore, the software is able to
reject most of the false detections (asteroids, transits, stellar pulsations), during analyzing the light curve. Other false
detections were rejected by us after analyzing the results. We detected ﬂares using three methods: the Trends method,
the Diﬀerence method, and the Flare proﬁle method.

4.1. Trends method

The Trends method is the ﬁrst method used by WARPFINDER to ﬁnd stellar ﬂares. It was inspired by automated
procedures described by Davenport et al. (2014). In the beginning, the software consecutively de-trends the light curve
using smoothing with a number of window lengths. In the beginning it smoothes the observed ﬂux with the running
average function with a window length of 175 points. After deﬁning the trend, it estimates standard deviation and
rejects all the points protruding 3σ above the trend, and then calculates the new trend using remaining points. This
step is repeated n times (default n = 5). For further analysis, the software ﬁnds all points protruding 1σ above the
trend. Next, all the series of four or more points placed 2.5σ above the trend are considered as ﬂares. The points do
not need to be consecutive and there could be some points between them, where the standard deviation is less than
2.5σ, however, it has to be bigger than 1σ. The whole process described above is repeated for the next ﬁve smoothing
windows (31, 75, 121, 221, and 311 points). Every ﬂare determined by other smoothing window is added to the list
but only if this ﬂare is not already on the list. It is possible to reduce the number of false detections using the next
two methods of automatic detection and by visual inspection.

4.2. Diﬀerence method

The second method of ﬁnding stellar ﬂares is the Diﬀerence Method, based on Shibayama et al. (2013). The idea
of this method is to check the ﬂux diﬀerence between two adjacent points. Contrary to the methods described by the
authors of the cited paper, WARPFINDER does not check the percentage distribution of diﬀerences but but only examines
the standard deviation of normalized ﬂux. This software analyzes only points placed above the 3σ limit. In addition,
the spread of the points is analyzed only for the positive values. Each point above the 3σ limit is marked as a potential
ﬂare detection. After that, the software compares the times of ﬂares detected by this method with the times of ﬂares
detected by the Trends method. Only the common detection of probable ﬂares in a designated time is treated by the
software as a potential detection and passed on to the next level of veriﬁcation.

4.3. Flare proﬁle method

After preparing a list of potential candidates for stellar ﬂares, WARPFINDER veriﬁes them by carrying out a detailed
analysis of their light curves. First, it tries to properly determine the beginning and the end of a ﬂare. After that, it
ﬁts the linear trend to the observational points before and after the ﬂare. The points with absolute standard deviation
greater than 1σ are not taken into account while the linear trend is ﬁtted. The start and the end time of the ﬂare are
iteratively corrected in the further actions of the software.

Following that, WARPFINDER ﬁts the deﬁned ﬂare proﬁle f1 to the observational data. Equation describing the proﬁle

is given by Gryciuk et al. (2017) as follows:

f1(t, A, B, C, D) =

A, B, C, D are parameters of the proﬁle, t stands for time, and erf is the error function. Before the convolution,
A is the amplitude of the gaussian, B is the time shift of the maximum of the Gaussian component, parameter C
stands for a timescale of energy depositing/release, parameter D corresponds to reverse of the timescale of cooling. We
noticed that in some cases a single proﬁle is not enough to properly recreate the observed light curve. For this reason,
WARPFINDER also ﬁts a proﬁle being the sum of the two proﬁles from Equation 8. We consider two cases: the sum of

Starspots Modelling and Flare Analysis on Selected MV Stars

7

the two proﬁles with diﬀerent A, C, D parameters but with the same B parameter (Equation 9, this equation will be
later referred as 1B double proﬁle) and the sum of the two proﬁles with diﬀerent A, B, C, D parameters (Equation 10,
this equation will be later referred as the 2B double proﬁle).

(9)

f2(t) = f1(t, A1, B1, C1, D1) + f1(t, A2, B2, C2, D2)
The quality of the ﬁt is checked by the χ2 statistic. The ﬁt that has the lowest normalized χ2 value is selected
for further analysis. We assumed that the normalized χ2 less than 5 represents a good ﬁt of a proﬁle to data. To
distinguish a stellar ﬂare from data noise, the software also uses the probability density function of F-distribution. We
visually estimated that this value has to be less than 0.1. Additionally, the software checks the skewness of the proﬁle,
as well as the rise and decay times. The rise time should be shorter than the decay time. It also checks the bisectors
of the proﬁle at the levels 10%, 20% etc. of the maximum signal value. Flares with duration less than 12 minutes (six
points in TESS two-minute data) are rejected

(10)

WARPFINDER uses two methods to estimate energy of the ﬂare and its maximal luminosity. The ﬁrst is based on the
method presented in Kov´ari et al. (2007) (also used and described in Vida et al. (2019)). In this method normalized
ﬂare intensity with subtracted background is integrated during the ﬂare event:

(11)

where t1 and t2 are the start and end times of the ﬂare, εTESS is relative ﬂare energy, Inorm is normalized ﬂare intensity
observed by TESS, with subtracted background during the ﬂare event. In the next step, the software estimates ﬂux
of the star Fstar in the observed by TESS interval of wavelengths (λ1, λ2). This is not bolometric ﬂux. To do so,
the procedure multiplies the spectrum of the star F(λ), taken from ATLAS91 for star’s log(g), Teﬀ , assumed Solar
metallicity, and vturb = 2 km s−1) with TESS response function STESS multiplied by the area of the star with the
radius R as follows:

Fstar = πR2

F(λ)STESS(λ)dλ

(12)

λ2(cid:90)

λ1

Factor four is missing in equation 12 due to using the theoretical spectrum and converting it to the astrophysical ﬂux.
To estimate the ﬂare energy, Eﬂare, WARPFINDER multiplies ﬂux of the star Fstar in the selected interval of wavelengths
by relative ﬂare energy εTESS:

Eﬂare = Fstar · εTESS
The second method that estimates energy of a stellar ﬂare requires: a ﬂare amplitude, ﬂare duration, stellar lumi-
nosity, and a radius. It is based on the method presented in Shibayama et al. (2013). Kowalski et al. (2015) showed
using hydrodynamic simulations that a temperature of about 10 000 K is needed in order to correctly reproduce white
light ﬂare emission on M stars. Thus, we assume the black body radiation and eﬀective temperature of a ﬂare (Tﬂare)
about 10 000 K (Shibayama et al. 2013; Mochnacki & Zirin 1980; Hawley & Fisher 1992). The ﬂare amplitude (Cﬂare)
is deﬁned as follows:

5.1. GJ 1243

GJ 1243 is a fully convective (Davenport et al. 2020) M4.0V dwarf star at a distance of 11.95 pc, with the mass
0.24 M(cid:12), the radius 0.27 R(cid:12), the eﬀective temperature 3261 K (MAST catalog2), and a rotation period equal P =
0.59260 ± 0.00021 day (Davenport et al. 2015). GJ 1243 also has an estimated diﬀerential rotation parameter of equal
0.012 ± 0.002 rad day−1 (Davenport et al. 2015) (for the Sun α(cid:12) = 0.2 rad day−1, diﬀerential rotation law is described
by Equation 3). Due to a very low diﬀerential rotation shear and a visible change of the phase of the mean minimal
signal, mainly in sector 15 (right panel of Figure 2), we estimated spottedness in each sector separately without taking
diﬀerential rotation into account. Small changes in the phase of minimal ﬂux of GJ 1243 are more likely caused by
the evolution of one of the spots than the diﬀerential rotation. In our analysis, we assumed the inclination i = 32◦
estimated by Silverberg et al. (2016). We estimated that the amplitude of this star in TESS data equals 1.00741. We
managed to do so by phasing the light curves from sectors 14 and 15 and taking the maximum value of the phased
mean light curve without taking into account the ﬂares. The determined maximal amplitude level is marked in the
left panel of Figure 2 as the dashed line.

GJ 1243 is an object of numerous studies due to its enormous ﬂaring and spot activity. Thanks to the 1460 days of
observations performed by Kepler, using one-minute cadence data Savanov & Dmitrienko (2018) managed to detect
6107 individual ﬂare events. Spots on GJ 1243 have been a target of much research since the publication of Savanov
& Dmitrienko (2011), where the authors showed, using temperature maps, that there should be two active regions on
the surface of the star, separated by 203◦ in longitude or by 0.56 in phase. The positions of spots were very stable
during 74 rotation periods. Later Ramsay et al. (2013) and Davenport et al. (2014) agreed with the statement that
this star should have two long-lived spots. Davenport et al. (2014) managed to detect over 6100 white light ﬂares
for the 11 months of observations of Kepler with by 1-minute cadence. Davenport et al. (2015) also conﬁrmed the
presence of two spots, one of which, located at high latitude, did not change. The second spot, located at the equator

was slowly changing during observations (timescale of hundreds of days). Based on data from Kepler, Savanov &
Dmitrienko (2018) argued that we can observe two spots on the latitudes between −30◦ and 30◦ due to an inclination
of the star equal to approximately 30◦. In addition, Davenport et al. (2020) managed to detect 133 ﬂares on this star
using TESS data and estimated that two similar spots are still present on the surface of the star. Although the light
curve modulation cannot be explained by using the model of spots on GJ 1243 from Kepler ’s data. Davenport et al.
(2020) provides possible explanation of the change of the light curve of GJ 1243: (1) We see the same spot that was
previously observed by Kepler and it did not change much between the observations, (2) the second spot observed by
TESS is a newer spot not observed by Kepler, only coincidentally aligned with the previous spot but it is probably to
be at the same latitude.

TESS observed GJ 1243 only during two, lasting ∼27 days periods, sectors 14 and 15. We selected 33433 individual
brightness measurements (with two-minute cadence) acquired over 47 days of the observations. Using BASSMAN we
received a similar two-spot model for each sector what is presented in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 3.

Sector 14 of the observations lasted 26.850 days (18289 observational points), from TBJD 1683.356 to 1710.206
(with an observational gap between TBJD 1696.391 − 1697.347). From all of the available measurements, due to the
negligible diﬀerential rotation and without any signiﬁcant evolution of the starspots, we selected 1151 measurements
without outlying points, with SNR equal 679, to model the light curve of the star. The result is the two-spot model
with spots separated by 235◦ ± 3◦ in a longitude or by 0.64 ± 0.008 in a phase. Parameters of the spots are presented
in the upper part of Table 1.

Sector 15 of the observations lasted 26.044 days (15145 observational points), from TBJD 1711.368 to 1737.412 (with
an observational gap between TBJD 1721.810 − 1724.944 and 1735.662 − 1737.067). In the same way as above we
selected 1069 measurements without signiﬁcant points, with SNR equal 608, to model the light curve of the star. The
result is the two-spot model where the spots are separated by 245◦ ± 4◦ in a longitude (or by 0.67 ± 0.01 in a phase).
Parameters of the spots are presented in the lower part of Table 1.

The recreated spots’ models (Table 1) ﬁt quite well to the analytical estimations received using Equations 5 and 6
(the comparison of parameters are in Table 2), and is quite similar to the model obtained by Savanov & Dmitrienko
(2018). Our results also conﬁrm the Davenport et al. (2020) research outcomes where he claimed that one of the
spots must have evolved so that the light curve observed by TESS does not ﬁt to the data obtained by Kepler. Our
model shows that one of the spots has not evolved since observations of Kepler but the second spot is now also a
near-equatorial spot. The star image of the positions and the sizes of the spots, the reconstructed light curve and the
contribution of each spot to the light curve can be seen in Figure 3. We tried to estimate diﬀerential rotation parameter
for this star. Short observational period of GJ 1243 convolved with the evolution of one of the spots did not make it
possible for us to estimate it properly. BASSMAN was unable to estimate non-zero diﬀerential rotation parameter.

recreated light curve and black dots are observations from TESS. The bottom panels present locations, sizes, and contrasts
of the spots in Aitoﬀ projection. The left panels stand for sector 14 and the right panels stand for sector 15. Both Aitoﬀ
projections assume phase = 0 at TBJD= 1701.78 days.

Correcting the light curves for the rotational modulation helped us to increase the automatic detection of ﬂares in
WARPFINDER by 17%, from 58 ﬂares to 68 ﬂares. Figure 4 shows the light curve corrected for the rotational modulation.
Orange triangles marks the ﬂare already detected before the subtraction of rotational modulation. The newly detected
ﬂares are marked with the green triangles. This increase can help in providing better analysis of ﬂares on GJ 1243
without confusing them with some rotational modulation eﬀects. 26% of the detected ﬂares have the best ﬁt with a
single proﬁle, 36% with the 2B double proﬁle and, 38% using 1B double proﬁle.

The left panel of Figure 5 shows the ﬂare energy distribution. The energy range is 1031.08 to 1032.9 erg and the
highest number of ﬂares has energies of approximately 1031.75 erg for the method based on Shibayama et al. (2013).
For the method based on Kov´ari et al. (2007) the maximum is about 1031.5 erg. The histograms in the right panel of
Figure 5 show the distribution of the growth time (the green histogram), the decay time (the red histogram) and the
total time (the blue histogram) of ﬂares on this star. The growth time varies from 7 to 41 minutes (the mean growth
time is approximately 14 minutes), the decay time changes from 12 to 182 (the mean decay time is approximately 44
minutes), and the total duration time of ﬂares varies from 22 to 223 minutes (the mean total duration time of a ﬂare
is approximately 58 minutes).

The left panel of Figure 6 presents the cumulative energy distribution estimated using both of the previously described
methods based on Shibayama et al. (2013) (blue) and Kov´ari et al. (2007) (red) with the ﬁtted power-law function
and the power-law index for each method. The power-law indexes of both ﬁts are almost the same. We used ﬂares
with energies ranging from 1031.5 to 1032.7 erg to receive the best ﬁt. The relation of the white light ﬂares’ duration,
in function of ﬂare energy for GJ 1243 for both methods is presented in the right panel of Figure 6. The newly
detected ﬂares are marked as the black crosses. We ﬁtted the power-law function to these data as in Maehara et al.
(2015). The power-law indexes of the two functions are indistinguishable which means that the ﬂare duration time is
τ ∼ E0.38 ± 0.029.

We tried to estimate if there is any correlation between the observed ﬂares and the presence of spots on the observed
side of the star, and if the ﬂares are distributed homogeneously in phase. To estimate if there is any correlation we

not be rejected. Left panel of Figure 7 shows the distribution of bolometrical energies of every ﬂare as a function of

5.2. V374 Peg

V374 Peg is a fully convective M3.5Ve dwarf (Morin et al. 2008) at the distance of 9.1 pc, with the mass 0.29 M(cid:12),
the radius 0.31 R(cid:12), the eﬀective temperature 3240 K (MAST catalog), and the estimated rotation period equal P =
0.4457572 ± 0.0000002 day (estimated as in Mighell & Plavchan (2013)). V374 Peg diﬀerential rotation parameter
equals 0.0063 ± 0.0004 rad day−1 (Morin et al. 2008). Using the same assumptions as for the GJ 1243 we recreated
the spots model without diﬀerential rotation. In our analysis, applied the inclination i = 70◦ estimated by Morin et al.
(2008). We evaluated that the amplitude of this star in TESS data equals 1.01208 as in subsection 5.1. The amplitude
level is marked in Figure 8 as the dashed line.

Figure 8. Left panel: the phased light curve of V374 Peg from all TESS observations (blue dots), the mean light curve made
of all phased light curves (red curve), the estimated maximal amplitude of V374 Peg (the black dashed line). Right panel: The

vertical bars present gaps in data. The red dots represent minimal signal in phases and the green dots represent maximal signal
in phase. The stellar ﬂares are visible as the bright horizontal pixels.

V374 Peg is a subject of studies due to ﬂaring and spot activity on its surface. This star has simple, strong, dipolar
magnetic ﬁeld with weak, low-latitude spots, stable on one-year timescales (Morin et al. 2008). Korhonen et al. (2010)
using both, spectroscopy and photometry, Vidotto et al. (2011) using MHD simulations, and Arzoumanian et al.
(2011), Gastine et al. (2013) using Zeeman-Doppler Imagining, managed to show that on the surface of V374 Peg
there were three groups of increased radial magnetic ﬁeld on intermediate latitudes where two of them had much
stronger magnetic ﬁeld induction than the third one. Later Vida et al. (2016) managed to recreate the light curve of
this star using three circular starspots of homogeneous temperature T = 3250 K. They showed that the light curve of
this star is stable over about 16 years, without any sign of a stellar activity cycle.

TESS observed V374 Peg during only one, lasting over 26 days, sector 15. Available data cover period from TBJD
1737.414 to 1711.369, with two observational gaps between TBJD 1720.489 − 1724.946 and 1734.184 − 1737.090. As
in subsection 5.1 from the 13237 individual brightness measurements we selected 1240 measurements without outlying
points, with SNR equal 990, in order to model the light curve of the star. We received two-spot model presented in
Table 3 and visualized in Figure 9. Spots are separated by 104◦ ± 2◦ in longitude or by 0.29 ± 0.005 in phase (Figure
9).

We tested if three-spot model can also recreate the light curve of this star (similarly to Vida et al. (2016)). We
obtained the similar result using only two-spot model. One of the spots was the same like in the two-spot model (this
was the spot on latitude 31 deg, Table 3) and the second spot (spot on latitude 51 deg, Table 3) was slightly smaller
and on a bit lower latitude and was accompanied very closely by one very small spot. Also, the ﬁt quality did not
change in signiﬁcant way. Considering this we chose that the two-spot model describes the observations of V374 Peg
from TESS is the best. The spots’ temperatures and sizes ﬁt quite well to the estimations received using Equations 5
and 6 (the comparison of parameters in Table 4). The model is fairly similar to the results received by Gastine et al.
(2013). The weakest magnetic area is not visible as a spot either because it is too weak to stop convective energy
transport or it could have evolved during the years of a time gap between TESS observations and the previous analysis
made for this star. This star was observed for the the one sector only. Also, V374 Peg has very stable light curve.
This did not allowed us to estimate the diﬀerential rotation parameter.

the model of light curve and the black dots are observations from TESS. The right panel presents locations, sizes, and contrasts

Subtracting the rotational modulation of the star from the observations (Figure 10) increased the detection of ﬂares
by 30%, from 37 ﬂares to 48 ﬂares (Figure 10). 24% of the detected ﬂares had the best ﬁt with a single proﬁle, 42% with
the 2B double proﬁle and, 34% using the 1B double proﬁle. The ups and downs of O-C values near the observational
gaps are caused by the decrease of TESS accuracy.

The left panel of Figure 11 illustrates the ﬂare energy distribution in the energy range from 1031.07 to 1033.15 erg.
The highest number of ﬂares has the energy approximately 1032 erg for the method based on Shibayama et al. (2013)
and about 1031.75 erg for the method based on Kov´ari et al. (2007). The histograms in the right panel of the Figure
11 show the distribution of the growth time, the decay time and the total time of the ﬂares. The growth time varied
from 6 to 100 minutes (the mean growth time was approximately 15 minutes), the decay time diﬀered from 17 to 111
minutes (the mean decay time was approximately 43 minutes), and the total time of the ﬂares varied from 27 to 193
minutes (the mean total ﬂare time was approximately 58 minutes).

The left panel of Figure 12 presents the cumulative energy distribution estimated using both of the previously
described methods with the ﬁtted power-law function for each method. The newly detected ﬂares are marked as the
black crosses. We used ﬂares with energies from 1031.5 to 1032.7 erg to receive the best ﬁt for the estimation. Similarly
as for GJ 1243 the power-law indexes of both ﬁts are almost the same. The relation of the white light ﬂares duration,

For this star, there is no visible correlation between the presence of spots and the number of ﬂares but the hypothesis
of homogeneous distribution of ﬂares is can rejected with the probability p = 0.9975. This is caused by the increased

5.3. YZ CMi

YZ CMi is a fully convective (Morin et al. 2008) M4.0Ve dwarf at the of distance 6 pc, with the mass 0.31 M(cid:12),
the radius 0.33 R(cid:12), the eﬀective temperature 3181 K (MAST catalog), and the estimated rotation period equal P =
2.77413658 ± 0.00000071 day (estimated as in Mighell & Plavchan (2013)). YZ CMi has the diﬀerential rotation
parameter equal 0.049 ± 0.043 rad day−1 (Morin et al. 2008).
In the same way as in the previous subsections we
estimate the spottedness without taking diﬀerential rotation into account. We assumed the inclination i = 60◦
estimated by Morin et al. (2008) and the amplitude of this star in TESS data equals 1.01904 (Figure 14).

phase and time for all TESS data of ﬂux. White vertical bars present gaps in data. The red dots represent minimal signal in
phase and the green dots represent maximal signal in phase. The stellar ﬂares are visible as the bright horizontal pixels.

YZ CMi has a strong dipolar magnetic conﬁguration with spot activity on its surface (Morin et al. 2008) what
makes it a desirable subject of studies. Using photometry Alekseev et al. (2001) estimated that it’s maximal spot
coverage was up to 21%. Two years later Zboril (2003) calculated the mean spot coverage on YZ CMi in the years
1996/1997 as approximately 5% but the typical spot coverage equals 10-15% (estimated using observations for the
seasons: 1972/1973, 1979/1980). Bruevich & Alekseev (2007) estimated the spottedness about 11.40%. Following

that, Alekseev & Kozhevnikova (2017), using more than 30 years of photometric observations, calculated that the
spottedness on this star changes in the range from 8% to 38%.

TESS observed YZ CMi during sectors 7 and 34. We selected 33120 individual brightness measurements (with
two-minute cadence) acquired over 49.434 days of the observations. We received three-spot model for sector 7 and
four-spot model for sector 34 that are described in Table 5 and visualized in Figure 16.

Sector 7 of the observations of YZ CMi lasted over 24 days (16326 observational points), from TBJD 1491.637 to
1516.091 (with an observational gap between TBJD 1503.041 and 1504.711). From all available measurements we
rejected measurements exceeding 1.7σ above the running mean (107 data points). The selected data had SNR equal
623. We obtained the three-spot model with spots separated by 70◦ ± 0.3◦ and 73◦ ± 0.4◦ in the longitude from the
middle spot or by 0.19 ± 0.0008 and 0.2 ± 0.001 in a phase (Figure 16). Their parameters are presented in Table 5.

Sector 34 of the observations of YZ CMi lasted over 24 days (16794 observational points), from TBJD 2229.090
to 2254.070 (with an observational gap between TBJD 2240.911 and 2242.441). From all available measurements we
rejected measurements above 1σ above the running mean (363 data points) in order to model the light curve. The data
had SNR equal 500. We obtained the four-spot model with spots located at longitudes: −137◦ ± 0.8◦, −94◦ ± 0.8◦,
−16◦ ± 1◦, and 138◦ ± 0.9◦ (Figure 16). The other parameters of the spots are presented in Table 5.

Spots’ temperatures and sizes agree well with the analytical estimations received using Equations 5 and 6 (the
comparison of the parameters in Table 6), and are fairly similar to the models received by the previously mentioned
authors. Similary as for other analyzed stars we were not able to estimate the non-zero diﬀerential rotation parameter.
This was caused by the fact that the distribution of starspots changed between sectors 7 and 34. Separate analysis of
each sector made it impossible to estimate the diﬀerential rotational parameter due to very short observational period.

Subtracting the rotational modulation improved the automatic detection of the ﬂares (Figure 17). In sector 7 the
number of ﬂares increased by 16% from 69 ﬂares to 80 ﬂares. In sector 34 the number of ﬂare increased by 19% from
67 ﬂares to 80 ﬂares. 46% of the detected ﬂares had the best ﬁt with the single proﬁle, 24% with the 2B double proﬁle,
and 29% using the 1B double proﬁle.

The left panel of Figure 18 shows the ﬂare energy distribution ranging from 1030.6 to 1034.09 erg. The mode of the
distribution is 1031.8 erg for the method based on Shibayama et al. (2013) and 1031.6 erg for the method based on
Kov´ari et al. (2007). The histograms in the right panel show the distribution of the growth, decay and the total times
of ﬂares. The growth time varied between 4 and 77 minutes (the mean growth time is approximately 15 minutes), the
decay time diﬀered from 15 to 273 minutes (the mean decay time is approximately 47 minutes), and the total time of
ﬂares varied from 21 to 306 minutes (the mean total ﬂare time is approximately 62 minutes).

The cumulative energy distribution and relations between ﬂare energy and ﬂare duration time are presented in Figure
19. It is evident that the power-law indexes of this relations are again practically the same. The power-law relations

For this star, there is no visible correlation between the presence of spots and the number of ﬂares in sector 7. The
upper right part of Figure 15 shows that ﬂares are distributed homogeneously as a function of phase. In sector 34
the spot number 3 has negative correlation with the presence of ﬂares. The probability of no corrlation is as low as
p = 0.006. This means that if this spot is visible then the ﬂare frequency decreases (Figure 20). The hypothesis of
homogeneous distribution of ﬂares in phase can not be rejected for sector 7 but it can be rejected for sector 34 with
the probability p = 0.9976. Left panel of Figure 20 shows the distribution of bolometrical energies of every ﬂare as
a function of rotational phase, the star spottedness of the visible side, and when the spot is present on the visible

6. DISCUSSION

We analyzed the three following stars: GJ 1243, YZ CMi, V374 Peg (shown in the upper panel of Figure 22). We
modeled the light curves of each star to estimate parameters and the distribution of the spots on these stars. We used
the calculated model to increase eﬃciency of detecting ﬂares and their duration times. On GJ 1243 we reconstructed
two-spot models with a mean spots’ temperature of approximately 2900 K and average spottedness about 3% for
sectors 14 and 15. On V374 Peg we achieved two-spot model with a mean spots’ temperature of approximately 3000 K
and average spottedness roughly 5.8% for sector 15. On YZ CMi we received three-spot model with a mean spots’
temperature of approximately 3000 K and average spottedness of about 9.4% for sector 7 and four-spot model with a
mean spots temperature of approximately 2800 K and average spottedness of around 7.4% for sector 34. The energies
of ﬂares received using both methods presented in this work gave us similar estimations of energies. Method based on
Kov´ari et al. (2007) gave slightly less energies.

We detected ﬂares with bolometric energies ranging from 1030.7 erg to 1034.1 erg. Energies in TESS bandpass range
from 1030.6 erg to 1034.0 erg). The growth times are between 4 and 77 minutes, decay times between 12 and 273
minutes, and a total ﬂare duration times between 21 and 306 minutes. The most energetic ﬂares observed on each star
can be seen in lower panels in Figure 22. The upper panel in Figure 22 shows that the stars we analyzed are much
more active than the stars analyzed by Doyle et al. (2020). Although the numbers of ﬂares per day are higher, these
stars do not show the ﬂares with the highest energies.

The results received by BASSMAN code allowed us to estimate distribution of spots on an analyzed stars in a manner
that was consistent with the previously mentioned literature. This approach could be further used to analyze other
stars whose variability of light curves is caused by the presence of stellar spots. Correcting the light curves on rotational
modulation allowed us also to increase signiﬁcantly a number of automatically detected ﬂares by WARPFINDER: 17% for
GJ 1243, 30% for V374 Peg, and 17% for YZ CMi. Most of the ﬂares detected after removing eﬀects of the rotational
modulations are ﬂares of energies approximately below 1032 erg (illustrated by the black crosses in the right panels of
Figures 6, 12 and 19). Another advantage of the subtraction of rotational modulation from the light curve is more
accurate estimation of the ﬂare’s start and end times, what helps to estimate the energy release during the ﬂares better.
In our opinion, this should help in better understanding of the ﬂare mechanism on analyzed stars. The obtained results
show that correcting the light curve for the rotational modulation eﬀect is necessary to conduct a correct analysis of
ﬂares on a given star.

We used three types of proﬁles: a single proﬁle and the proﬁles described by Equations 9 and 10. The single proﬁle
usually describes ﬂares with low amplitudes and short decay times where the non-thermal particles are probably main
photosphere heating mechanism. Flares with longer duration times and higher amplitudes can be heated not only by
non-thermal particles but also during the process of ”radiative backwarming”. This process is likely represented by
the second proﬁle with longer growth and decay times and with smaller amplitudes.

GJ 1243 has very similar ﬂare proﬁles distributions in both sectors. In sector 14, 20% of all ﬂares (7 ﬂares) were
classiﬁed as single proﬁle ﬂares, 31% (11 ﬂares) as 1B double proﬁle, and 49% (17 ﬂares) as the 2B double proﬁle. In
sector 15 it was 18% of all ﬂares (6 ﬂares), 27% (9 ﬂares), and 55% (18 ﬂares) respectively. This result may indicate
the similar distribution of ﬂare mechanisms occurring in both sectors of observation of GJ 1243 with a greater number
of ﬂares of higher energies.

V374 Peg in sector 15 had 24% of all ﬂares (12 ﬂares) classiﬁed as single proﬁle ﬂares, 34% (16 ﬂares) as the 1B
double proﬁle, and 42% (20 ﬂares) as the 2B double proﬁle. V374 Peg has similar distribution of ﬂare proﬁles to
GJ 1243. Both stars have almost the same parameters like masses, radiuses, eﬀective temperatures and rotational
periods, what can explain the similarity of the ﬂare proﬁles distribution. We recommend them for more observations
to estimate the possible changes the distribution of ﬂare types.

YZ CMi has diﬀerent ﬂare proﬁle distribution for both sectors. In sector 7, 26% of all ﬂares (21 ﬂares) are classiﬁed
as single proﬁle ﬂares, 40% (32 ﬂares) as the 1B double proﬁle, and 34% (27 ﬂares) as the 2B double proﬁle. In sector
34 it was 66% of all ﬂares (53 ﬂares), 19% (15 ﬂares), and 15% (12 ﬂares) respectively. This change of the proﬁle
distribution can be caused by the star’s activity cycle. Ol´ah, K. et al. (2016) showed the logarithmic relation for the
activity cycle period of stars in function of the rotational period. The shorter rotational period, the shorter activity
cycle. Using this relation, we estimated the possible period of an activity cycle on YZ CMi to 5.0 ± 0.8 years. The one
and a half year gap between sectors 7 and 34 may explain the change of ﬂare type distribution.

We carried out an analysis similar to the one presented in Namekata et al. (2017). Basing on scaling laws presented
there, we estimated the magnetic ﬁeld inductions and the ﬂare loop lengths. The scaling law assume constant pre-ﬂare

where τ is the ﬂare duration time, E is the estimated bolometric ﬂare energy, B is the magnetic ﬁeld induction, and
L is the length of the loop. The results of our analysis are shown in the left panel of Figure 21, where we have plotted
lines for the diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld inductions (15, 25, 45 G), and for the diﬀerent ﬂare loop lengths (1010, 1011 cm).
The right panel of Figure 21 presents the estimated loop lengths relative to the stellar radius. For analyzed ﬂares
the magnetic ﬁeld induction changes in a range from 15 G to 45 G and the ﬂare loop length changes in a range from
1010 cm to 1011 cm. Only one ﬂare on YZ CMi does outlies the mentioned border due to much higher energy and
duration time. This ﬂare can be seen in the lower right panel of Figure 22, in upper right corner of left panel of
Figure 21, and can be regarded as a superﬂare on this star. The values of the magnetic ﬁeld inductions and the loop
lengths compared with the results from Namekata et al. (2017) show that these stars have lower magnetic induction
than superﬂares on the Solar-type stars observed by Kepler. The lower magnetic ﬁeld induction in ﬂares can stand for
diﬀerent magnetic dynamo processes inside the analyzed stars due to the fact that analyzed stars are fully convective.
Wright & Drake (2016) presented possible scenarios for magnetic dynamo in fully convective stars. These stars might
be able to generate a purely turbulent dynamo or the convection in their cores could be magnetically suppressed
(Cox et al. 1981), making convection less eﬃcient (Moss & Tayler 1970), and leading to the existence of a solar-like
tachocline. The lengths of the ﬂare loops on these stars (right panel in Figure 21) show that these lengths multiple
times exceed the lenghts of the radii of the stars. On the Sun active regions have very complex magnetic ﬁeld topology
with a multitude of loops. Each of these loops has to be taken into account while estimating total magnetic energy
that can be released during the ﬂare (Aschwanden et al. 2014). This can mean that estimated huge lengths of the
loops might correspond to very complex and extensive active regions with dozens or hundreds of magnetic loops each
of them contributing into the total released ﬂare energy.

We tried to ﬁnd out whether there is any correlation between the occurrence of ﬂares as a function of the rotational
phase and the presence of spots. Using χ2 test, we did not detect any dependence between the presence of the spots and
the occurrence of the ﬂares on GJ 1243 and V374 Peg. We received a similar solution analyzing sector 7 of observations
of YZ CMi. However, for sector 34 there is an anticorrelation between one of the spots and the occurrance of the ﬂares
(Spot 3). This can suggest that magnetic ﬁeld of this spot is much more potential. An active region needs to have
very non-potential magnetic ﬁeld to release stored free magnetic energy. Potential magnetic ﬁeld has no free magnetic

Figure 22. The upper panel presents the number of ﬂares per day for GJ 1243, YZ CMi, V374 Peg (presented as stars) and for
stars from Doyle et al. (2020) (presented as points) as a function of the rotation period. The points are color-coded and present
the maximum ﬂare energy from the star. The bottom panels present the strongest ﬂare on each of the analyzed stars with the
ﬁtted ﬂare proﬁle. Each of these are the 2B double proﬁle. The energies are 1033.36 erg for GJ 1243, 1033.63 erg for V374 Peg,
and 1034.62 erg for YZ CMi.

energy to be released during the ﬂare (Aschwanden 2005). Also, Hawley et al. (2014) and Morin et al. (2008) showed
that ﬂares on active M dwarfs appear randomly in many independent active regions.

We tried to examine if ﬂares that occurred on every analyzed star are distributed homogeneously in the rotation
phase. For GJ 1243 in both sectors of the observations and for YZ CMi in sector 7 the hypothesis of the homogeneous
distribution of ﬂares can not be rejected. For V374 Peg, the hypothesis of the homogeneous distribution of ﬂares is
rejected with the probability p = 0.9975 due to the increased number of ﬂares between phases 0.7 − 0.9 (left panel of
Figure 13). Also, for YZ CMi in sector 34 this hypothesis can be rejected with the probability p = 0.9976 due to the
lower number of ﬂares when the Spot 3 is present on the observed surface of the star.

The cumulative ﬂare frequency distributions for each of these three stars allow us to compare their levels of activity.
For GJ 1243, ﬂares with energies at least 1031 erg appear approximately three times per day, with energies at least
1032 erg appear approximately three times per week, and with energies at least 1033 erg appear approximately two
times per year. On V374 Peg ﬂares with energies at least 1031 erg appear approximately three times per day, with
energies at least 1032 erg appear approximately once a week, and at least 1033 erg appear approximately three times

per year. On YZ CMi ﬂares with energies at least 1031 erg appear approximately seven times per day, with energies at
least 1032 erg appear approximately six times per week, with energies at least 1033 erg appear approximately two times
per month, and ﬁnally at least 1034 erg appear approximately three times per year. On the Sun ﬂares with energies
at least of Carrington Event (∼ 5 · 1032 erg, Cliver, Edward W. & Dietrich, William F. (2013)), appear approximately
once per 150 years (Chapman et al. 2020) and can especially in big number, be catastrophic for hypothetical life on
eventual orbiting planets. According to Vidotto et al. (2013), a planet similar to Earth orbiting an M dwarf star in
a habitable zone should have magnetic ﬁeld induction of the order of ≈ 10 − 103 G to guarantee the same protection
as in the case of the present-day Earth. The ﬂaring activity of such active star may signiﬁcantly limit live-hosting
capabilities on their planets. The life forms may survive the activity of the hosting star by living underground or
underwater, or by using photoprotective bioﬂuorescence (O’Malley-James & Kaltenegger 2019).

The estimated power-law index α for a relationship between the ﬂare time duration and the energy released during
the ﬂares (0.38 ± 0.029 for GJ 1243, 0.28 ± 0.05 for V374 Peg, 0.34 ± 0.019 for YZ CMi) matches well the same relation
estimated for the stellar white light superﬂares (τ ∼ E0.39) in Maehara et al. (2015) and theoretical relations consistent
with magnetic reconnection τ ∼ E1/3 in Namekata et al. (2017). When taking all ﬂares detected on all three stars the
α is equal to 0.35 ± 0.015. This result supports the hypothesis of magnetic reconnection causing stellar ﬂares.

Analysis of white-light ﬂares and distribution of starspots on stars is important to understand the stellar magnetic
dynamo better and to ﬁnd out how it is aﬀected by the stellar internal structure. It is believed that the mechanism
of the magnetic dynamo may diﬀer in more massive stars with a radiant interior, tachocline, and convective envelope,
compared to the dynamo in fully convective stars. Observing stellar spots and ﬂares in white light is important, as
they can place additional constraints on the dynamo mechanism, allowing us to better understand the activity cycles
and ﬂare mechanisms on stars. Additionally, it can help in estimating the possibility accompanying planets being
habitable, to estimate the possibility of ﬁnding life on these planets, and maybe theorize how it may evolve.
