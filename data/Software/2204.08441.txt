Abstract

We present an approach for adapting the Gaussian dispersion analysis
(GDA) of optical materials to time-domain simulations. Within a GDA
model, the imaginary part of a measured dielectric function is presented
as a sum of Gaussian absorption terms. Such a simple model is valid for
materials where inhomogeneous broadening is substantially larger than the
homogeneous linewidth. The GDA model is the essential broadband ap-
proximation for the dielectric function of many glasses, polymers, and other
natural and artiﬁcial materials with disorder. However, eﬃcient implemen-
tation of this model in time-domain full-wave electromagnetic solvers has
never been fully achieved. We start with a causal form of an isolated os-
cillator with Gaussian-type absorption — Causal Dawson-Gauss oscillator.
Then, we derive explicit analytical formulas to implement the Gaussian os-
cillator in a ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) solver with minimal use
of memory and ﬂoating point operations. The derivation and FDTD im-
plementation employ our generalized dispersive material (GDM) model — a
universal, modular approach to describing optical dispersion with Pad´e ap-
proximants. We share the FDTD prototype codes that include automated
generation of the approximants and a universal FDTD dispersion implemen-
tation that employs various second-order accurate numerical schemes. The
codes can be used with non-commercial solvers and commercial software for
time-domain simulations of light propagation in dispersive media, which are
experimentally characterized with GDA models.

PROGRAM SUMMARY

Program Title: MADIS
CPC Library link to program ﬁles:
Code Ocean capsule: (to be added by Technical Editor)
Licensing provisions(choose one): GPLv3
Programming language: MATLAB
Nature of problem: The problem of eﬃcient time-domain simulation of the Gaus-
sian absorption is essential for wideband modeling of the optical response from
materials with inhomogeneous spectral broadening, such as glasses, polymers, and
other natural and artiﬁcial composite materials with structural or phase disorder.
Solution method: A Coupled Oscillator (CO) approximation to the Gaussian ab-
sorption in both the frequency and time domains is derived to solve this problem.
The time-domain CO approximation is coupled to the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain
(FDTD) solver for the Maxwell equations in the MADIS (MAterial DIspersion
Simulator) package. Veriﬁcation of the Maxwell solvers’ accuracy and stability
is performed with the FDTD solver coupled to a compact universal implemen-
tation of the CO model, employing second-order schemes (either ADE or RC).
Code prototypes of these eﬃcient CO schemes can be ported to other methods
and platforms for implementing the Gaussian absorption in open-source codes or
commercial software.

1. Introduction

Realistic numerical modeling of light-matter interaction requires accurate
broadband approximations of the dispersive dielectric functions. The disper-
sion models used in the frequency domain for characterizing optical materi-
als are very diverse. Models that substitute the tabulated experiment-based
descriptions of the dielectric function are commonly used in variable angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) and frequency-domain (FD) simulations.
However, only a limited subset of these frequency-domain models are directly
applicable to time-domain simulations. To be eﬃcient in the time domain
(TD), the dielectric function must be computed recursively in time through
a numerical approximation of either the auxiliary diﬀerential equations or
a convolution integral. This requirement signiﬁcantly limits the classes of
available approximants. This is why standard methods of computational

2

electromagnetics in the time domain (e.g. [1]) are utilized only for classical
models, such as the Lorentz damped oscillator, Debye relaxation, and Drude
plasma models.

The classical models are most appropriate for crystalline solids, where
all oscillators of a given class are immersed in the same local environment.
In contrast to crystalline solids, the local environment in amorphous mate-
rials is not uniform; its variations create inhomogeneous broadening of the
resonant line-shape. A convolution model of such broadening was initially
proposed by Eﬁmov et al. [2, 3] and later by Brendel and Bormann [4]. This
model treats absorption bands as a set of Gaussian distributions of homoge-
neously broadened Lorentz oscillators. To satisfy causality the approach was
initially amended by De Sousa Meneses [5]. Recently, a new, fully-causal and
asymptotically consistent ﬁx of the Eﬁmov convolution has been proposed
by Orosco et al. and used to approximate the dielectric functions of metals
[6, 7].

If the inhomogeneous broadening is much larger than the homogeneous
linewidth, then the absorption bands can be approximated by isolated Gaus-
sian distribution peaks, providing a simple, experiment-based approximation
to the convolution models. This approach — Gaussian dispersion analysis
(GDA), proposed by McDonald et al.
[8] and improved by Kefee [9] — is
one of the most application-critical approximations commonly used to char-
acterize the broadband dielectric function of polycrystalline and amorphous
materials with disorder including oxides [10–12], polymers [13–17], metals
[18, 19], and as an additional term to ﬁt the complicated dispersive behav-
ior of other disordered solids, such as, for example, phase change materials
[20–22]. With this approach, the imaginary part of a dispersive dielectric
function, (cid:61) [ε(ω)] = ε(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω), is presented as a sum of Gaussian absorption
terms χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
G(ω, i) that may correspond to separate oscillations in the phonon
density of states and disordered light-matter interactions in the ultra-violet
bands

The important problem in employing the Gaussian-based dielectric functions
in time-domain Maxwell solvers has not been addressed in the literature. In
this paper, we adapt the dielectric function described with causal Dawson-
Gauss oscillators for use with time-domain numerical solvers. To enable
computationally eﬃcient and accurate conversion from Gaussian absorption
terms we use Pad´e approximants of argument s = −ιω. Standard numerical

3

ﬁtting approaches done individually for each set of dispersion parameters are
ineﬃcient and important asymptotic properties and symmetries could be lost.
Hence, we derive explicit formulas for the approximants, preserving their
analytical properties and connection to parameters of the original dispersion
formula.

The paper includes all the code prototypes for (i) analytically-derived
Pad´e approximants of diﬀerent orders, and (ii) coupling of the converted
model with a generic TD solver written in a high-level interpreted language
(MATLAB) that could be ported to other languages if needed. For sim-
plicity, we use the classical Yee’s Finite Diﬀerence Time Domain (FDTD)
scheme [23], however the technique can be used with other explicit or im-
plicit TD schemes, including Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD)
[24], Finite Volume Time Domain (FVTD) [25], Finite Element Time Do-
main (FETD) [26], or higher-order FDTD schemes [27]. This paper and
codes are intended to allow for seamless integration of Gaussian dispersion
analysis derived dielectric functions into commercial software as well as non-
commercial Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) and multiphysics codes.
For example, the proposed approach was successfully tested with commercial
time-domain solvers, ANSYS Lumerical (FDTD) and COMSOL Multiphysics
(DGTD).

2. Mathematical Model

In this section, we describe a mathematical model of light propagation in a
dispersive medium characterized by a ﬁnite set of Gaussian absorption pro-
ﬁles. First in Section 2.1, we introduce the dielectric function for an isolated
Dawson-Gaussian oscillator in causal analytical form. Then we introduce a
generalized dispersive material (GDM) formulation [28, 29] in terms of the
Pad´e approximants in Section 2.2. The GDM formulation is used later in
Section 3.1 to adapt the Gaussian-based models for TD solvers. In the ﬁnal
Section 2.3, the universal TD-compatible GDM dielectric function is coupled
with Maxwell equations to model light propagation in a dispersive medium.

2.1. Gaussian Absorption Model
In the Gaussian model, the material absorption is characterized by a Gaus-
sian distribution Ae−(ω−Ω)2/σ2 with a given amplitude A, center Ω, and width
σ. The causal, parity-consistent formulation of Gaussian absorption [9, 30]

4

requires adding a second term, since χ(cid:48) and χ(cid:48)(cid:48) shall be even and odd func-
tions of frequency respectively, χ(cid:48)(−ω) = χ(cid:48)(ω) and χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(−ω) = −χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω) [31].
Thus, we arrive at the causal Dawson-Gaussian oscillator model χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
G(ω) that
is broadly used in Gaussian dispersion analysis,

χ(cid:48)(cid:48)

G(ω) = A

(cid:104)

e−(ω−Ω)2/σ2−e−(ω+Ω)2/σ2(cid:105)

.

(2)

Here we use the orange and blue colors to keep track of the formulas symme-
try. The blue term is needed for causality and is mandatory for the correct
Fourier transform to the time domain. However, in frequency domain solvers,
the blue term can be neglected if its contribution is small. For example, if
Ω > 3σ, we have e−(ω+Ω)2/σ2 < 2 · 10−4 for all ω > 0. If the Gaussian width
σ is larger than the oﬀset of Gaussian center Ω, then the positive (red) and
negative (blue) peak of the Gaussian absorption are not isolated from each
other, the merged absorption peak becomes asymmetric and does not corre-
spond to an isolated normal distribution. This σ/Ω-ratio dependent behavior
should be taken into account when permittivity data is ﬁtted with a GDA
model and the physical consistency of the ﬁt is assessed.

The real part of the causal Dawson-Gaussian model can be found from

the imaginary part (2) using the Kramers-Kronig relation

where the crossed integral sign is the Cauchy principal value integral and
F (y) is the Dawson function, connected to the Gaussian distribution through
the Hilbert transform, H{e−x2}(y) = 2π−1/2F (y) [32]. Note that while the
Dawson function is an odd function F (−x) = −F (x), the diﬀerence of the
Dawson pair in (3) is even, in compliance with the analytical properties
of the dielectric function. The resulting causal dielectric function term is
χG(ω) = χ(cid:48)
G(ω). Throughout the paper Gaussian (absorption)
model refers to the causal Dawson-Gaussian dispersion model (2)-(3).

function to the Faddeeva function w(z) [33],

The derivation can be found in the Appendix. The Faddeeva function is an
exponentially scaled complex complementary error function w(z) = e−z2erfc(ιz)
and is related to the Dawson function as w(z) = e−z2 + 2ιπ−1/2F (z). The
Faddeeva function is closely related to another known special function —
πw(ζ) — commonly used in the
a plasma dispersion function, Z(ζ) = ι
theory of linearized waves in hot plasma, with or without a magnetic bias,
whenever the velocity distribution is taken to be Gaussian [34].

√

After substitution, z = ιs, function ws(s) = w(ιs) becomes a Positive
Real Function (PRF) of the complex argument s. This follows from the
fact that ws(s) is entire and non-negative real for pure imaginary argument
(cid:60)[ws(±ιω)] = e−ω2 ≥ 0, see for example [35]. By the deﬁnition, PRF is
a function f (s) of a complex variable s, which is (i) real-valued for real s
and (ii) has a non-negative real part whenever the real part of s is positive,
(cid:60)[s] > 0 ⇒ (cid:60)[f (s)] ≥ 0, [36]. This property is important to guarantee that
positive loss (cid:61)(ω) = (cid:60)[s] > 0 results in non-negative absorption χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω) ≥ 0
in (4), which is important for physical consistency of the dielectric function
and stability of time-domain numerical schemes.

If a dielectric function is approximated for time domain modeling with
a rational polynomial of order n, ε(ω) ≈ εn(ω), then the approximation
εn(ω) ideally should also maintain the non-negative absorption property for
physical consistency. Testing for suﬃcient positive-reality (PR) conditions of
rational approximation [−ιεn(ιs)] is not always straightforward, but a num-
ber of necessary PR conditions are easy to check, including constraints on the
polynomial roots and coeﬃcients that are mentioned in the next section 2.2.

Since the classical Lorentz oscillator has straightforward implementations
in time-domain solvers, it is commonly used as a rough approximation to the
Gaussian model. Figure 1 compares a Gaussian to its Lorentzian approxima-
tion with the same center Ω = 4 and broadening (FWHM = 2σ(cid:112)log(2) = 1)
b0 = 4.031 and b1 = 1.004 obtained
that correspond to Lorentz parameters
from (14). As can be seen in Fig. 1(abc) the Lorentz approximation fails
to accurately reproduce the highly conﬁned Gaussian absorption proﬁle in
both — the frequency and time domains. By contrast, the model derived in
this paper is based on the GDM decomposition principle (discussed in Sec-
tion 2.2); it gives an accurate and TD-compatible representation in terms of
Coupled Oscillators (CO) even for the lowest order (n = 2), see Section 3.1.
It is important that the time-domain representation (6) shows that the
Gaussian model represents a single harmonic oscillator at frequency Ω. In
contrast to the Lorentz damped oscillator with constant homogeneous scat-
tering Γ, the Gaussian oscillator has a time dependent scattering function
ΓG(t) = tσ2/4 or inhomogeneous broadening. Fitting Gaussian absorption
with multiple Lorentz terms in frequency domain would inevitably produce
multiple non-physical oscillations. However, with the analytically constrained
coupled oscillator model derived in this paper, we will see that individual
phase-relaxed oscillators eﬀectively form a single oscillator model with a slow-
varying harmonic modulation that approximates inhomogeneous broadening
(Lemma 2).

2.2. The Generalized Dispersive Material Model
Due to the diversity of dispersion laws in the optical range, modular ap-
proaches for the numerical implementation of dispersion in the time domain

are more eﬃcient compared with individual implementations for each disper-
sion model. In modular approaches, any dielectric function can be decom-
posed into a sum of generic terms with a known recursive TD implementation.
For example, in the TD CEM literature, dielectric functions are often approx-
imated with multi-pole Debye relaxation models, or with a combination of
Lorentz oscillator terms.

A known danger of such modular approaches is overﬁtting the experi-
mentally measured dielectric function with too many parameters, producing
nonphysical oscillations or relaxations. An interesting approach for evaluat-
ing model quality based on information criteria is proposed in [37]. In the
method outlined in this paper, to avoid overﬁtting and resulting nonphysi-
cal terms, we use our prior approach [28] of building a physically-constrained
rational approximation of argument s = −ιω based on general analytic prop-
erties of the dielectric function. It will be shown that the Gaussian dispersion

non-zero phase and possibly one Lorentzian term (not multiple Lorentzian
terms as a simple model-ﬁtting approach might suggest).

In time-domain modeling, the dielectric function is assumed to be causal
(ε(t) = 0 for t < 0), and thus ε(ω) is analytic in the complex upper half-plane
((cid:61)[ω] > 0), with the real and imaginary parts connected via Kramers-Kronig
relations (Hilbert transform). By substituting ω = ιs, s ≥ 0, the Fourier
transform of a causal dielectric function, ε(ω) = (cid:82)
R ε(t)eιωtt., becomes a real
integral transform of a real-valued function which converges for a wide class
of non-growing functions ε(t). Thus, the dielectric function ε(ω) can always
be represented as a rational approximation with real coeﬃcients pi, qi on the
positive imaginary axis ω = ιs, s ≥ 0,

ε(ω) = εn(ω) ≈

(7)
and the domain of this deﬁnition can be analytically continued to the entire
upper half-plane (cid:61)[ω] ≥ 0, as long as all the poles are located in the lower
half-plane. Here n is the order of denominator (or number of poles). The
order of the numerator is smaller or equal to n due to the ﬁnite permittivity
limit at inﬁnity.

Basic properties of the linear causal dielectric function ε(ω) that should
be inherited by the approximation εn(ω) and thus constrain coeﬃcients pi, qi
include:

(i) Poles property: εn(ω) is analytic in the upper half-plane (causality
principle). Therefore, Qn(s) is a Hurwitz polynomial, and thus its
coeﬃcients must be nonnegative, qi ≥ 0, i ∈ 0, n − 1.

(ii) Zeros property: εn(ω) should not have zeros in the upper half-plane.
Therefore Pn(s) is a Hurwitz polynomial and hence its coeﬃcients must
be nonnegative, pi ≥ 0, i ∈ 0, n. (i.e. ε−1
n (ω) is analytic in the upper
half-plane).

(iii) Non-negative absorption: εn(ω) should have non-negative total ab-

sorption in the upper half-plane, i.e. ε(cid:48)(cid:48)

n(ω) ≥ 0 for (cid:61)(ω) > 0.

Statements (i)-(ii) are corollaries of property (iii), which is in turn equivalent
to the function −ιε(ιs) being a PRF of argument s, e.g. see criterion in [38].

9

Non-negativity of absorption (iii) for the classical Lorentzian with Γ ≥ 0
is satisﬁed naturally. For non-Lorentzian dispersions, it may not be possible
to achieve condition (iii) with a rational approximation, but the asymp-
totic version of (iii) will always follow from the approximation convergence:
n(ω)) → 0 as n → ∞, which can be made exponentially fast with a
min
ω
proper approximation technique.

(ε(cid:48)(cid:48)

For cases when (iii) is not satisﬁed exactly, testing for properties (i)-(ii)
is necessary for stable time-domain modeling. Testing for ‘positive realness’
is not always straightforward, a recent review of the PRF criteria, suﬃcient
and necessary conditions, is presented in [35]. In general, PRF properties are
long and well studied in the context of network synthesis [36, 39], and can
be utilized for physical consistency and stability analysis of approximated
dielectric functions in time-domain CEM.

The poles property (i) should always be tested, since it does not depend
on the presence of other dispersion terms in the dielectric function (unless
poles cancel during the summation of terms); therefore, the constraint on
qi is mandatory. However, the zeros property (ii) and absorption property
(iii) depend on other dispersion terms in the sum: selected terms and partial
sums could have zeros in the upper half-plane and negative absorption that
are not present in the total sum.

For example, the well known physically consistent Drude model with loss

Γ and plasma frequency Ω, can be decomposed into two terms as

,

=

−

(8)

s = −ιω.

εDrude(ω) =

Ω2
s2 + sΓ

Ω2
Γ2 + sΓ

Ω2
sΓ
Here, condition (ii) holds for the combined fraction since p0 = Ω2 ≥ 0, but
fails for the second term p(2)
0 = −Ω2Γ−1 ≤ 0, after the conductivity pole is
detached. In other words, after such decomposition, we obtain a Debye term
with negative absorption, although the total Drude model does not have gain.
Similarly, when a sum of oscillators approximates the Gaussian dispersion,
individual terms can have signiﬁcant negative absorption, as it can be seen
in Fig. 5that cancels in the total sum. It can be shown that for a coupled
oscillator pair approximating Gaussian dispersion, the properties (i)-(ii) hold
as long as Ω > σ, which is in agreement with the initial assumptions of the
Gaussian model in Section 2.1.

From these examples we observe that constraints (ii)-(iii) should be ap-
plied only to each physically independent and spectrally isolated dispersion
term in its complete rational representation (7).

10

For the time-domain implementation, we perform partial fraction decom-
position of (7) assuming simple poles only (with multiplicity 1), where prop-
erties (ii)-(iii) for each individual term in the sum are relaxed for the reasons
explained above. The dielectric function is represented as a unique combina-

This universal TD-compatible description of material dispersion (9) is called

This form, also referred to as critical points (CP) model of order ν = −1,
was initially used to approximate the dielectric functions of semiconductors
[40–42]. Beyond semiconductors, (16) has been successfully employed to
approximate the optical properties of metals [43–45] and gain materials [46].
The asymptotic behavior of the CP model was improved by Leng et al. [47].
The algebraic decomposition (9) indicates that with a modular GDM
approach, a non-zero phase should be added to the Lorentz oscillator, making
the absorption peak of the oscillator asymmetric. Using one (as in Fig. 1)
or more symmetric Lorentz terms (14) to approximate Gaussian absorption
results in poor accuracy and generates non-physical behavior. However, as
we show in Section 3.1, a combination of just two coupled CP terms (11)

12

with non-zero phase, approximates a Gaussian oscillator with a few percent
of relative error. This accuracy level is suﬃcient for approximating most
experimental data.

Summarizing Sections 2.1–2.2, we conclude that a combination of Gaus-
sian absorption terms enables the compact, physics-driven, and accurate FD
characterization of optical materials with disorder. By utilizing a GDM de-
composition approach FD Gaussian models can be adapted for TD numerical
schemes with acceptable accuracy. In particular this approach is physically-
constrained, and computationally eﬃcient in TD as outlined in detail in
Section 3.

2.3. Dispersive Maxwell Equations
To model light propagation in dispersive media, we couple the previously
discussed dispersive dielectric function χ(t) with the time domain Maxwell
equations (17). These equations connect the inducing ﬁelds — the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld vectors, E(x, t) and H(x, t), with the induced ﬁelds —
the magnetic ﬂux density B(x, t) and electric displacement D(x, t), where all
quantities are functions of x and time t,

(cid:40) ∂tD = ∇ × H,
∂tB = −∇ × E,

D = ε0 ε ∗ E,

B = µ0H,

t ≥ 0.

(17)

Here ε0 and µ0 are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in
vacuum respectively. They are connected to the speed of light in vacuum via
µ0ε0. The expression ε ∗ E in (17) denotes a convolution in time,
c0 = 1/
i.e.

√

D(x, t) = ε0 ε ∗ E = ε0

ε(τ ) E(x, t − τ ) dτ,

(18)

−∞

where ε(t) is a causal dielectric function, requiring that ε(t) = 0 for all
t < 0. For simplicity, we assume isotropic non-magnetic optical materials
(µ = 1), however the exact same GDM model (21) is applicable for arbitrary
dispersive magnetic permeability, including magnetic Gaussian terms. GDM
can also be generalized to the anisotropic and bi-anisotropic cases.

In the frequency domain, the system of equations in (17) becomes

(cid:40) −ιωD(ω) =

∇ × H(ω),

D(ω) = ε0 ε(ω) E(ω),

B(ω) = µ0 H(ω),

form of their corresponding quantities in the TD. For example, E(x, ω) cor-
responds to E(x, t) via the transform pair

The dielectric function is usually given in the frequency domain, ε = ε(ω),
and it deﬁnes the dispersion characteristics of the material. In this paper we
assume that the dispersion properties of the material are given in GDM form

where a0,i, a1,i ∈ R and b0,i, b1,i ≥ 0. The ﬁrst-order GDM terms (i.e. Debye
terms) are accounted for in the sum as a special case of χi(ω), where a0,i =
b0,i = 0. The conductivity term is added separately, so the case of zero pole
a0,i = b0,i = b1,i = 0 is forbidden in the sum.
In the codes, conductivity
and ﬁrst-order GDM terms are implemented separately from the second-
order GDM terms for optimized performance. The conductivity term can
be implemented in Yee’s scheme without any additional storage. The ﬁrst-
order terms require only one additional vector storage per term, while each
second-order term requires two.

The FDTD-GDM method described in the next Section 3 oﬀers a univer-
sal second-order accurate numerical solution to the TD Maxwell equations
(17,21) for light propagation in dispersive media. This FDTD-GDM method
works for the dispersion models introduced through GDM decomposition

14

(or approximation), including the GDM approximation of the Gaussian ab-
sorption model derived in this paper. In the FDTD-GDM method, diﬀerent
second-order ADE and RC numerical schemes are implemented in a universal
and compact form [28, 29], including the conventional ADE, bilinear ADE,
TRC, quasi-TRC, PCRC, PLRC methods.

3. Numerical implementation

The numerical implementation section contains two subsections.
In Sec-
tion 3.1 we derive the analytical GDM approximation of Gaussian absorp-
tion with controlled accuracy. In Section 3.2 we implement the GDM model
into Yee’s FDTD scheme using a compact universal formalism applicable to
various second-order-accurate ADE and RC schemes.

3.1. GDM approximation of the Gaussian absorption model
The goal of this section is to present a GDM approximation for the Gaussian
absorption model to enable accurate time-domain simulations. One possible
approach for generating a GDM approximation is to use optimization algo-
rithms and ﬁt the Gaussian data with a GDM sum. This would require solv-
ing an optimization problem for each and every combination of parameters
and given materials. Also, important analytic properties and symmetries
Instead of curve ﬁtting,
of the original Gaussian absorption may be lost.
we analytically derive an explicit GDM formula with coeﬃcients that are
explicit functions of the Gaussian parameters [A, Ω, σ]. This derivation con-
sists of two steps. (1) ﬁnding a constrained minimax rational approximation
of the real Dawson function F (x) with real argument x, see Section 3.1.1.
(2) analytical derivation of the GDM approximation for the complex Gaus-
sian susceptibility as a function of 4 variables χG(ω; A, Ω, σ) and its Fourier
transform in TD, see Section 3.1.2.

In step 1, we can use known rational approximations for (i) the Daw-
son function F (x), and the relation (3) to χ(cid:48)
G(ω); (ii) the Gaussian function
G(x) = e−x2, and the relation (2) to χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
G(ω); or (iii) the Faddeeva function
w(x) (or a closely related plasma dispersion function, Z(x) = ι
πw(x)),
along with the susceptibility formula (4). Since the imaginary and real parts
of the permittivity are connected through the Hilbert transform (Kramers-
Kronig relations), it is suﬃcient to approximate any of the functions (i)-(iii)
and then derive the complex multi-parametric susceptibility formula ana-
lytically. However, known approximations are often built for high-precision

√

15

computation of special functions with guaranteed double-precision accuracy
(10−15 − 10−13). Furthermore, almost all known computational algorithms
use diﬀerent formulas for separate segments of the complex plane where their
convergence is fastest. The maximum error across the entire half-plane of
a speciﬁc low-order approximation is usually unacceptably large for most
known algorithms, unless a minimax optimization method is used across the
entire domain.

In this paper, we focus on the lowest-order polynomials that provide a
relative error at practically acceptable levels (starting from few percent).
Every increase in polynomial order causes substantial increases in storage
and ﬂoating point operations in TD Maxwell solvers. Worse, using higher-
order polynomials can result in over-ﬁtting and nonphysical oscillations in
the time domain. The ”optimal” rational approximant for a given number of
poles n can be found by solving a constrained minimax optimization problem.
This method gives a solution with uniform and controlled exponentially con-
verging error across the entire spectral domain, while maintaining analytical
properties (such as asymptotic behaviour at inﬁnity). The error of the n-th
order minimax approximation (Fig. 3(a)) has a typical proﬁle with uniform
(2n − 1) alternating peaks, according to the Chebyshev alternation theorem
and the Remez algorithm.

To show the beneﬁt of minimax versus non-minimax rational approxima-
tions in the literature, we compare their relative errors, for both the Dawson
and Faddeeva functions. In Figure 2(b,d) the green line shows the typical
error behaviour of a non-minimax method, in this case, an asymptotic 2-
point Pad´e approximation method [48]. In this method, the coeﬃcients for
the plasma dispersion function are found by matching the asymptotic ex-
pansions at 0 and inﬁnity. The convergence at inﬁnity is better than the
minimax method by many orders of magnitude, but the maximum error
is unacceptably large. Similar behaviour is observed for other non-minimax
methods: for example, the widely used McCabe’s continued fractions method
[49] and Abrarov’s sampling methodology [50] require 24-25 poles to reach
the same maximum error as the minimax solution with 8-9 poles. Generally,
non-minimax rational approximations demonstrate exceptional performance
in limited ranges, making them a good ﬁt for segmented computational al-
gorithms.

We also reviewed known minimax rational approximations. The earliest
approximations by Hastings [51] and Cody [52] do not have the required
analytical properties and/or have a limited range. Hui [53] built a minimax

16

approximation for the Faddeeva function on the imaginary axis w(ιx), but on
the real axis its maximum error is too large, as shown in Fig. 2(a,c). Hum-
licek [54] built an unconstrained minimax rational approximation for the
Dawson function. The maximum error compared to our approximation is
only slightly better, achieved at the cost of constant non-converging error at
the inﬁnity, see Fig. 2(c). This is not desirable for time-domain simulations.
Finally, both Lether [55] and Sykora [56] solved the same constrained min-
imax optimization problem for the Dawson function for 2 ≤ n ≤ 6. Lether
ﬁnds a near -minimax constrained solution through the modiﬁed Remez algo-
rithm. His approximations have a slight deviation from the true constrained
minimax solution presented in this paper, see Fig. 13(a). Sykora attempts
to ﬁnd the constrained minimax optimum numerically, but doesn’t reach the
global minimum for orders 4 ≤ n ≤ 6, see Fig. 2(b,d).

Figure 2: Comparison of the Dawson/Faddeeva rational approximation errors using our
constrained minimax optimization (Table 9-11) (solid blue line, “this paper”) versus known

line, Huml´ıˇcek [54] and solid green line, Hui [53]), and n = 4, (Right column: solid red

coeﬃcients for Dawson/Faddeeva functions is done using Eqs. (27-29). The orders n =

son function gives the lowest-order approximation for a given maximum er-
ror to the Faddeeva function on the real axis with the correct asymptotic
behaviour. This approach is used in the next Section 3.1.1.

3.1.1. Rational approximation of the Dawson function
We seek a rational approximation Fn(x) of the Dawson function F (x) that
satisﬁes the following analytical properties of F (x):

(i) odd parity F (−x) = −F (x);

(ii) at x = 0 all even derivatives vanish, F (2k)(0) = 0 for all k > 0;

(iii) at x = 0 the ﬁrst derivative is equal to one, F (cid:48)(0) = 1;

(iv) asymptotic behavior F (x) ≈ 0.5x−1 as x → ∞.

Such an approximation thus should have the form

F (x) ≈ Fn(x) = x

(24)
where the coeﬃcients are real positive numbers, pi, qi > 0, and the properties
(iii) and (iv) enforce constraints p0/q0 = 1 and qn = 2pn−1, respectively. The
approximation order n deﬁnes the order of the denominator and thus the
number of poles. Since pi, qi > 0, Fn(x) does not have real positive zeros nor
does it have real positive poles (in the general case, the number of zeros/poles
satisﬁes Descartes’ rule of signs).

The lowest order we consider is n = 2. We skip the ﬁrst-order polyno-
mial F1 = x/(1 + 2x2), since it gives a 40% error when the coeﬃcients are
constrained by (iii)-(iv), and 25% unconstrained. The rational polynomial
F1(x) corresponds to approximating the dielectric function with one Lorentz
oscillator. As we have seen earlier in Fig. 1 it can not reproduce the Gaussian
lineshape accurately.

Note that the initial problem of approximating a multi-parametric com-
plex dielectric function χ(ω; A, Ω, σ) in (2-3) is reduced to approximating a
real function of one real variable (24). As discussed earlier, instead of the
minimizing root mean square deviation (l2-norm), standard for curve ﬁtting,

18

we formulate the minimax optimization problem to minimize the maximum
relative approximation error (l∞-norm) to ﬁnd coeﬃcients pi, qi,

|1 − Fn(x)/F (x)|.

(25)

This general constrained optimization problem is then solved numerically,
using the MATLAB function fminimax over a ﬁnite range of arguments
x=linspace(0,20,1000). The function is based on a goal attainment al-
gorithm [57]. The obtained approximations (Table 9) for 2 ≤ n ≤ 8 give
an ideal uniform minimax proﬁle for the error (Fig. 3(a)) that converges ex-
ponentially for both the Dawson and Faddeeva functions (Fig. 3(d)). The
approximation error goes to zero for large x (Fig. 2(c,d)) because of the con-
straint qn = 2pn−1 which matches the Dawson asymptote. The solutions
found are a slight improvement over Lether’s published data, n ≤ 6 [55] with
his constrained near-minimax formulation (see Fig. 13)(a)) and are a signiﬁ-
cant improvement over Sykora’s published data for n ≤ 6 [56] (see Fig. 2)(b)).
Also the solutions are found for an extended range of orders 2 ≤ n ≤ 8 (vs.
2 ≤ n ≤ 6 in [55, 56]).

The ﬁrst two approximations for n = 2, 3 are the most important for its
application in TD Maxwell solvers, and so we write them here for reference,

F2(x) = x

1 + 0.45823x2
1 + 0.80414x2 + 0.91646x4 ,

F3(x) = x

1 + 0.85449x2 + 0.22599x4 + 0.19920x6 .

(26)

After coeﬃcients pi, qi are found numerically with the correct constraints,
we perform partial fraction decomposition of Fn(x) to n individual poles, and
obtain Eq. (27) (complex coeﬃcients ai, bi are listed in Table 9). This pole
expansion is used to restore the complex function via the Hilbert transform.
However, using this form directly in the optimization problem (25) would
make the constraints complicated.

real and negative or complex with a nonzero imaginary part (see Table 9).
The algebraic structure of the Gaussian approximation (28) is the same as
the Dawson approximation (27). If n is odd then the sum has exactly one
−an > 0 and the
real negative pole an < 0 with a positive residue bn
rest of the poles are complex conjugate pairs.
If n is even then the sum
consists of conjugate pole pairs only (see Table 10). The poles ai are the
same and can not be real positive numbers.
In contrast to the Dawson
approximation, the zeros of the Gaussian approximation can not be avoided
on the positive real axis in this approach. However, the minimum negative
value of the Gaussian approximation converges to zero exponentially with
order n. To illustrate this, we plot the logarithm of the additive inverse of
the approximation log[−Gn(x)], so that only the “criminal” negative values
of Gn(x) show up for each order n in the plot (while positive values go to NaN
and are not displayed), see Fig. 13(b). We can see that even approximation
orders n (without the Lorentzian center) result in inﬁnitely long negative
tails, while odd orders n (with the Lorentzian center) produce ﬁnite ranges
of negative values.

During this summation, the opposite pole [(−ιx) −
−ai] cancels out. As
a result, all the poles and zeros of the approximation wn(x) are located
in the left half-plane (check Table 11). In other words, if we combine the
poles back into a single rational polynomial wn(ιs) = Pn(s)/Qn(s), then the
resulting polynomials Pn(s), Qn(s) are Hurwitz polynomials. This property
is important for the stability of FDTD schemes (and other TD solvers). Even
though the necessary positive-realness condition is met, the function wn(ιs)
is not a PRF. For real arguments s, the function wn(ιs) is real. But for
complex arguments s with a positive real part (cid:60)[s] > 0, the real part of the
function wn(ιs) can achieve small negative values. It means that the dielectric
function εn(ω) deﬁned by Eq. (4) can also achieve small negative values.
However, the minimum negative value is proportional to the approximation
error and goes to zero exponentially as the approximation order n increases,
see Fig. 13(c). In that sense, the derived approximation wn(ιs) can be called
asymptotically positive real. Real materials usually have non-zero Lorentzian

21

broadening (Γ > 0) in addition to the inhomogeneous broadening (σ > 0)
which provides a shift ω → ω + ιΓ in the complex plane and compensates for
the small negative absorption values. Also, one can add numerical dissipation
in the time-domain scheme, if needed, to cancel out these negligible negative
absorption values.

Alternatively, approximations with strictly positive absorption can be
built by posing a minimax optimization problem directly on Gaussian func-
tion. For example, the ﬁrst two approximations, G2(x) ≈ exp−x2 and G3(x) ≈
exp−x2, in this alternative approach read

G2(x) =

G3(x) =

1 + 0.68488x2 + 1.227526x4 ,

1
1 + 1.121306x2 + 0.03068x4 + 0.546042x6 .

(30)

These approximations, however, do not converge exponentially and give sig-
niﬁcantly larger approximation errors than the Dawson constraint minimax
approach used in this paper.

The resulting pole expansions for Dawson/Gauss/Faddeeva functions and
all ﬁnal coeﬃcients for TD simulations are summarized in Tables 9-11 for
2 ≤ n ≤ 8. These coeﬃcients can be used more broadly for calculating
the Dawson/Faddeeva functions with a guaranteed accuracy of 10−7 − 10−3
depending on the order n, as indicated in (Fig. 3(d)). The polynomial order
n should be chosen depending on the required accuracy and computational
complexity. The approximation n = 2 gives a relative error on the order of
few percent, which in practice is comparable to experimental error much of
the time. Higher precision, <1%, is achievable with three poles (n = 3). The
maximum number of poles calculated was n = 8, yielding an approximation
with single machine precision, 1e-7.

Note that the constrained minimax solutions were found numerically for
relatively low orders 2 ≤ n ≤ 8 using standard global optimization techniques
within MATLAB. The results demonstrated an ideal minimax error proﬁle
with uniform peaks (Fig. 3(a)). An ideal exponential convergence rate of
the maximum error with the polynomial order n is veriﬁed in Fig. 3(d) and
conﬁrms that the mimimax solutions were found correctly.

We speculate that ﬁnding exponentially converging constrained minimax
solutions (either numerically and/or using a modiﬁed Remez algorithm) is
possible for higher orders (n > 8). According to the convergence ﬁgure 3(a),
double precision accuracy (10−15) is expected for n = 16 poles, but extended

22

precision arithmetics and advanced fraction decomposition algorithms may
be required. For example, in the derivation of the Faddeeva function approx-
imation, we used numerical partial fraction decomposition (with MATLAB
function residue). Numerical partial fraction decomposition is a known ill-
posed problem and likely to become inaccurate as the error approaches com-
puter round-oﬀ for larger orders and thus special care is needed for larger
orders n.

3.1.2. GDM formula for Gaussian absorption
Before deriving the GDM formula, we summarize the previous nomenclature.
First, we have the Gaussian parameters [A, Ω, σ] — the absorption maxi-
mum, center, and width — that deﬁne the Gaussian susceptibility function
χG(ω) according to Eq. (2-3). From the time-domain formula (6), we see that
the absorption amplitude parameter A can be swapped with the time-domain
amplitude parameter a using a linear relation a = 2Aσ/

Here arg[z] is an argument function of a complex number z (can be computed
using angle(z) or atan2(imag(z),real(z)) in MATLAB). The square root
denotes the principal branch ((cid:60)(
z) ≥ 0). One way of proving Lemma 1
is to substitute the Faddeeva function with its approximation (29) into the
frequency domain susceptibility formula (4), and then use formulas (12) to
ﬁnd the time-domain oscillator parameters.

In Figure 4 we perform an approximation error check for the complex
susceptibility function obtained in the Lemma 1. As expected, the error
converges exponentially with approximation order n.

Lemma 1 together with Table 9 of coeﬃcients [ai, bi] gives a GDM rep-
resentation (21) of the Gaussian dispersion. More speciﬁcally, the GDM
parameters [a0,i, a1,i, b0,i, b1,i] can be found as simple expressions of the oscil-
lator parameters [ai
c] using formulas (13). This GDM model can
be seamlessly implemented in TD solvers using either Auxiliary Diﬀerential
Equation (ADE) or Recursive Convolution (RC) implementations for each
oscillator. Numerical implementation of arbitrary dispersion in GDM form
is presented in detail in Section 3.2 for the FDTD method. Obtained polar-
ization recursions can be also coupled to other TD Maxwell solvers.

It is important that the parameters of the approximation model are de-
rived analytically. In contrast to models generated via mathematical ﬁtting
of multivariate curves containing many Gaussian terms, this analytical ap-
proach does not require a new ﬁtting procedure for every set of parameters.
This allows us to retain connections with the original physics of the Gaus-
sian proﬁle as well as use Gaussian models already available from VASE
measurements in the time domain.

The lowest order approximations, n = 2 and n = 3, in particular provide
an eﬃcient, stable, and accurate technique for simulating Gaussian dispersion
in the time domain with just 2 and 3 oscillators respectively. For the reader’s
convenience, these cases are formulated as separate corollaries of Lemma 1
with included constants.

Lemma 1 (for arbitrary n) gives a powerful universal algorithm to adapt
any inhomogeneous broadening proﬁle, described by a Lorentz model convo-
luted with an arbitrary symmetric (with zero skewness) probability density
function (PDF) with a given variance σ, for time-domain simulations. Oscil-
lator parameters (35) in Lemma 1 can be further analyzed depending if the
pole is real or complex.

Lorentz oscillator. In case of a real pole, which is present only for odd
n and has the 0-th index by notation, see Eq. (27), a0 < 0, b0 > 0, we obtain

From now on, the above system of two oscillators arising from conjugate
poles of the Dawson approximation and formulas (35) is called a Coupled

the left-shifted and right-shifted oscillator in the pair.

The diﬀerence between the two oscillators, the classical Lorentz and CO
pair (39), is a slowly-varying cosine modulation factor (shown in red) that
is capable of eﬃciently approximating the Gaussian lineshape even for the
smallest order n = 2. We can also convert the oscillator (39) into exponential
notation. The result of this analysis is formulated as Lemma 2 below.

Lemma 2 provides a simple pathway to deriving the time domain com-
patible approximation that can be applied to any model with inhomogeneous
broadening. For example, Gaussian broadening in the time domain is simply
substituted with complex exponentials each corresponding to a pole in the
minimax approximation of the Dawson function (the Hilbert transform of
the Gaussian function).

This relation also proves that the proposed approximation does not gen-
erate random, non-physical oscillations in the time domain, even for large
approximation orders n. In fact, for any approximation order, the model rep-
resents a single oscillation with a slow-varying envelope that depends solely
on parameter σ and approximates the quadratic Gaussian lineshape with a
complex exponential series. This is possible because of the correctly derived
analytical form of the susceptibility function (as opposed to ﬁtting). Every
oscillator in the approximation is either (i) Lorentz at frequency Ω, or (ii)
a coupled oscillator pair that eﬀectively behaves as Lorentz at frequency Ω
modulated with a slow cosine envelope (39).

Finally, in Figure 5 we plot the contribution of each individual oscillator
to the approximation vs. the exact Gaussian susceptibility, and show the
changes in the oscillator ensemble vs.
increasing approximation order (for
n = 2, 3, 4, 5). When n = 2, the right- and left-shifted oscillators seem to
be uniquely deﬁned by the negative and positive peaks (respectively) in the
real part, without cancelling each other, and thus the model is unlikely to
have overﬁtting problems. The two asymmetric absorption terms sum up
to produce a symmetric proﬁle approximating a nearly-Gaussian absorption
distribution. For n = 3, the addition of the Lorentz oscillator, exactly aligned
to the Gaussian center, tremendously improves the accuracy from slightly
noticeable deviation (few percent error) to indiscernible curves (<1% error).
In this case, the central Lorentz oscillator becomes the leading contribution,
while the CO pair add missing correction terms for the curve in the peak
as well as in the tails. At n = 4, the two right-shifted oscillators (as well
as the two left-shifted ones) have opposite signs and thus partially balance
each other to achieve the required curve as a sum. This overcompensation
trend becomes even more pronounced when n = 5 — the central Lorentz
absorption peak increases in the positive direction while the CO pair grows
in the negative direction. For n > 5 the amplitude of the largest term
grows with the approximation order even further, thus requiring signiﬁcant
compensation from the additional terms.

As we show in the simulation section, the higher-order approximations

29

provide mathematical representations of the Gaussian absorption lines in
the time domain with machine precision and are stable in TD simulations.
Nonetheless, these approximations are unnecessary complicated, computa-
tionally expensive, and do not correspond to any simple physical models,
compared to the simpler n = 2 and n = 3 cases. From both the physical and
computational point of view, 2- and 3- oscillator models are the most ap-
pealing and likely to be used for engineering and characterization of realistic
macroscopic optical responses in media with disorder.

pair (CO±); (b,f) 3 oscillators — Lorentz and a CO pair (L, CO±); (c,g) 4 oscillators —

3.2. FDTD-GDM method for light propagation in dispersive media
In this section, we extend Yee’s classical FDTD scheme [23] for solving
Maxwell equations (17) to the general dispersive case, where an arbitrary
dielectric function is given in the GDM form (21). These dispersive FDTD-
GDM schemes were originally published in [28] and [29]. In this section we
present a brief recap with detailed reference to the codes.

culate the local response Pi = ε0E(a0,i −ιωa1,i)/(b0,i −ιωb1,i −ω2) in the time
domain from the known electric ﬁeld E(t). Diﬀerent schemes can be derived
with either (a) ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation of the diﬀerential equation on
Pi – this method is called the Auxiliary Diﬀerential Equation (ADE) method,
see Section 3.2.1, or (b) numerical integration of the convolution integral –
this method is called Recursive Convolution (RC) method, see Section 3.2.2.
Here both ADE and RC schemes are implemented with a universal scheme,
where a table of coeﬃcients is built for 6 diﬀerent second-order RC and ADE
schemes and can be extended to other schemes. The last step in Section 3.2.3
couples the obtained universal recursion on Pi to a numerical solution of
Maxwell equations through the full polarization vector P = (cid:80)
i Pi with a
compact universal scheme.

In sections 3.2.1-3.2.2, the goal is to write an explicit scheme for the
recursive calculation of each Pi in the GDM sum (21) independently. For
simplicity of notation the index i is omitted in these sections and only one
GDM term is assumed,

P = ε0E

In section 3.2.3, where the full system of numerical equations is derived, we
return to the full multi-term notation.

3.2.1. Auxiliary Diﬀerential Equation (ADE) schemes
The ADE method of incorporating dispersion can be used when the dielectric
function gives an immediate ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) for the po-
larization terms. In the case of the single-term GDM model, the polarization
equation (41), after substituting −ιω with time derivative ˙f (t, x) = ∂f /∂t,
gives a second-order ODE

˙P + b0P = ε0

˙E + a0E

(cid:17)

.

(42)

To solve (42) numerically we introduce the ﬁnite time step τ and use the
discrete function notation f n ≈ f (nτ, x) that approximates the solution.
We seek a second-order accurate scheme, since Pn will be coupled to the
second-order Yee’s scheme for Maxwell equations.

ADE scheme. The most common second-order ADE scheme for disper-
sion models (called “ADE” in this paper) is achieved with centered deriva-

31

tive approximations ˙f (nτ ) ≈ (f n+1 − f n−1)/(2τ ) and ¨f (nτ ) ≈ (f n+1 − 2f n +
f n−1)/τ 2 and f (nτ ) ≈ f n on both sides of Eq. (42).

ADE2 scheme. An alternative second-order scheme (called “ADE2” in
this paper) can be formed by replacing f (nτ ) ≈ f n with f (nτ ) ≈ (f n+1 +
2f n + f n−1)/4. This second scheme is known as the bilinear scheme in the
literature, and it corresponds to the consistent approximation of all j-th
derivatives in the GDM model with powers of the same z-transform (−ιω)j =
(2τ −1(z − 1)/(z + 1))j. This way the internal states of the continuous model
are followed more closely by the discrete model. Also, the bilinear scheme
guarantees stability preservation. For details on the comparison of diﬀerent
ADE approximations and stability analysis see [58].

Both schemes can be written using centered averaging and diﬀerence op-

erators, µtf n = (f n+1/2 + f n−1/2)/2 and δtf n = (f n+1/2 − f n−1/2)/τ ,

3.2.2. Recursive Convolution (RC) schemes
RC schemes are derived from the convolution integral, if the chosen numerical
integration quadrature can be written in a recursive way. For a single-term

TD representations (10) and (11) as

if a0 = b0 = 0,

(48)

(49)

Parameters a, Γ, Ω, ϕ are obtained from a0, a1, b0, b1 using (12). The suscep-
tibility χ(t) is a real function that is either one real exponent if a0 = b0 = 0,
or is a sum of two exponents (possibly complex).

Traditionally, formulation of RC methods (e.g., for Lorentz media) re-
quires that the two exponents are complex conjugate. Here the derivation
formulas do not use complex conjugation and work equally for the damped
oscillator case (b0 > b2
1/4) which gives two complex conjugate exponents
and for the overdamped case (b0 < b2
1/4) which gives two real decaying
exponents. Recursive convolution (RC) schemes are derived regardless of
b0 ≷ b2
1/4 for any GDM dispersion for variety of second-order quadratures,
including Trapezoidal (TRC), quasi-Trapezoidal (TRC2), Piecewise Constant
with second order modiﬁcation (PCRC2), and Piecewise-Linear (PLRC).

Single pole, χ =

since it gives only one exponential term in the susceptibility and can be
implemented with less computational cost than the general case.

The parameters A, B are introduced for a uniﬁed notation with the general
case. For a single exponent (50), the recursion for the convolution integral
(48) is based on the identity

P(t + τ ) = eBτ P(t) + Aε0

is derived for continuous ﬁelds (prior to any approximation).

that P(t + τ ) is determined from P(t) and a ﬁnite time history of E(t) for
t ∈ [t, t + τ ].

Next, we assume that the integral in (51) is approximated with a two-

point quadrature, leading to a recursive update formula on Pn+1

Pn+1 = eBτ Pn + Aτ ε0

(cid:2)θ0 En+1 + θ1eBτ En(cid:3) ,

(52)

where the weights θ0 and θ1 are to be determined by the quadrature rule and
may depend on B and τ . For example, three trivial RC schemes can be built
immediately using θ0 = 0, θ1 = 1 (left Riemann rule), θ0 = 1, θ1 = 0 (right
Riemann rule), and θ0 = θ1 = 1/2 (trapezoidal rule, or TRC). Out of three,
only the TRC scheme is second-order accurate. TRC was used in one of the
ﬁrst works on dispersive Yee’s scheme by Bui et al. in 1991, and even earlier
in Bui’s master’s thesis from 1990 [59]. This seems to be independent from
the ﬁrst Leubbers et al. work the same year [60]. The left Riemann rule was
used in another classic work on dispersive FDTD by Hawkins&Kallman in
1993 [61], where it was referred to as “rectangular quadrature”, but it is only
ﬁrst-order accurate.

Perhaps the most famous works on dispersive FDTD are by Luebbers et
al. [60, 62, 63], frequently called “the original RC method”, also referred to
as “(FD)2TD” by the authors (Frequency Dependent FDTD). The method
name was later established as PCRC (Piecewise Constant RC) or sometimes
simply CRC. In PCRC, the electric ﬁeld in the integral (51) is taken as
constant E(t+˜t) ≈ E(t+τ ), while the exponential susceptibility is integrated
exactly

(53)

This approximation corresponds to θ0 = (Bτ )−1(eBτ − 1), θ1 = 0 and is also
only ﬁrst-order accurate.

In 1995 Siuchansian&LoVetri followed Lueberrs approach and increased
the accuracy to second order by using the trapezoidal rule for the electric
ﬁeld E(t+ ˜t) ≈ E(t+τ )/2+E(t)/2 in the integral (51) (while still integrating
the exponential susceptibility exactly) [64–66]

To avoid confusion with the pure trapezoidal (TRC) rule (θ0 = θ1 = 1/2),
the approximation (54) is sometimes called the quasi-trapezoidal (quasi-TRC)
and corresponds to (θ0 = (Bτ )−1(eBτ − 1)/2, θ1 = θ0e−Bτ ).

In 1996 and 1998 two second-order RC schemes were published by Lueb-
bers & co-authors based on his original ﬁrst-order RC scheme.
In [67]
they used a piecewise linear approximation of the electric ﬁeld E(t + ˜t) ≈
E(t) + ˜t (E(t + τ ) − E(t)) /τ in the integral (51). Integration gives

This RC approximation is called Piecewise Linear (PLRC). In the second
scheme [68] authors used the same piecewise constant approximation of the
electric ﬁeld as in original PCRC, but shifted the quadrature points to half
steps, which corresponds to θ0,1 = (Bτ )−1(±e±Bτ /2 ∓ 1). This recursive
approximation is called PCRC2.

Table 1 provides a universal list of weights calculated for all the mentioned
quadrature rules conventionally used in the literature for RC-FDTD schemes,
mainly for Debye and Lorentz media. Using such parameterization through
coeﬃcients θ0, θ1, we will implement all the diﬀerent second-order RC schemes
for a general GDM model with the same algorithm and computational cost.
Despite the existing discussions in the FDTD literature on the diﬀerences in
computational cost of diﬀerent RC and ADE schemes (e.g. [66]) we will show
that all these approximations can be implemented in the exact same scheme
with diﬀerent coeﬃcients and thus are computationally equal. Note that in
the case of a zero pole, e.g. Drude model (b0 = a1 = 0) the limiting value of
the weights θ0,1 with β → 0 should be used for proper numerical integration.
In this manuscript, the polarization equation is coupled to the second-
order Yee’s FDTD scheme. To maintain the order of accuracy it is best
to use second-order RC schemes, for example, TRC, TRC2, PCRC2, and
PLRC. This enables global second-order accuracy in the coupled RC-FDTD
Yee’s scheme.

where the two terms are not necessarily complex conjugate to each other and
could be both real. This generality allows for overdamped cases (b2
1/4 > b0),
including the Drude term (a1 = b0 = 0).

Applying the recurrence (51) for each complex exponential term in (56),
and then combining them into a single real-valued recurrence gives the same
form of the numerical scheme as ADE methods (47). Full derivation of this
RC recurrence is presented in the Appendix. The resulting θ0,1-dependent
real coeﬃcients αi, βi for all RC schemes are summarized in Table 2. Here
the weights θ+
0,1 and θ−
0,1 are taken according to the chosen RC quadrature
0,1 = θ(B = B+) and θ−
using Table 1 where θ+
0,1 = θ(B = B−) respectively.

36

Note that all the coeﬃcients αj, βj in the table are real since A±, B± are
either real or complex conjugate A+ = A−, B+ = B−.

Thus we uniﬁed the ADE and RC schemes into a universal stencil with
real recursive accumulators and coeﬃcients, so that switching between schemes
in the program does not change data types or memory requirements.

In general, an RC scheme can be constructed if the convolution kernel
is expressed as a sum of exponents with a linear argument. The non-linear
(quadratic) argument in the Gaussian model (6) signiﬁcantly complicates its
RC (and ADE) realization. Instead of ﬁnding a way of direct implementa-
tion of (6) we use our oscillator approximation model in Section 3.1 that is
accurate and computationally cheap.

3.2.3. Compact universal GDM-FDTD scheme
The universal ADE and RC formulation (47) with coeﬃcients in Table 2
can now be coupled to the classic second-order Yee’s scheme for Maxwell
equations (e.g. [1]) through the polarization vector P = (cid:80)N
i=1 Pi. Thus we
obtain the following universal scheme for solving Maxwell’s equation with
GDM dispersion (17,21)

Here the numerical operators as before are δtf n = (f n+1/2 − f n−1/2)/τ and
µtf n = (f n+1/2 + f n−1/2)/2, and coeﬃcients αj,i, βj,i ∈ R depend on the
particular choice of ADE or RC approximation, and are shown in Table 2.

We choose to keep the contracted notation for the approximation operator
∇h of the gradient (h — spatial step) without explicitly writing the spatial
indices. We assume the classic leap-frog Yee’s scheme is used for space. The
formulas (57) only show the modiﬁcation of the time stencil required for the
dispersion implementation. The full spatio-temporal implementation in 1D
can be found in the MADIS codes and can easily be extended to the full 3D
case.

In contrast with conventional approaches, where each scheme requires a
separate implementation, the generalized form (57) oﬀers a convenient route

37

to implement various ADE and RC schemes within the same core code with
a conditional operator that sets the values of αj,i and βj,i for the speciﬁc
scheme desired.

Also, while conventional RC implementation relies on complex conjuga-
tion and does not support the over-damped case with real poles (b1 ≤ b2
0/4),
the universal implementation (57) operates with real coeﬃcients and func-
tions and thus works for any generic second-order GDM term without this

Furthermore, as shown in [28], the universal implementation (57) can
be written in a compact form to calculate En with two real recursive ac-

Comparison of the three implementations — standard complex RC, uni-
versal (57), and compact universal [28] — is summarized in Table 3 for one
GDM term. First, we count the number of elementary operations, assuming
that complex multiplication and addition take 6 and 2 FLOPs, respectively,
with the universal scheme taking 30% more FLOPs and the complex RC
formulation taking twice as many FLOPs as the compact version. In terms
of storage, all three implementations require storing two numerical arrays,
polarization terms (either the real and imaginary parts of Qn
i , or two time
levels of the real-valued polarization Pn
, or two real-valued accu-
i
mulators Ψn
i ). But organizing computation in the compact universal
formulation without additional storage is more convenient since the update
formulas involve only one time-step of the electric ﬁeld, En.

4. Simulation examples

Besides amorphous and polycrystalline materials such as glasses [8, 9], semi-
conductors, oxides [10–12, 69], and polymers [13–17] the eﬀective media ap-
proximations built on Gaussian models retrieved from VASE are also broadly
used to characterize materials with structural and phase disorder, induced
either during fabrication or phase transition. Examples of such media with
structural and phase disorder include irradiated glasses, electroplated metals,
island metal ﬁlms (see, e.g. [18, 19, 70]), and phase change materials [20–22].

veriﬁed on diﬀerent classes of optical materials including glasses, polymers,
and semi-continuous metal ﬁlms.

Here, we demonstrate examples for three representative cases, silica, gold
island ﬁlms, and polymers. The ﬁrst example can be found in the included
code package. We show using our GDM approximation that broadband
Gaussian models retrieved with VASE can be directly implemented in a
time-domain solver. The approximation accuracy and convergence of the
dispersive FDTD solver are veriﬁed for all cases with 1D ﬁlm simulation
tests.

4.1. Glasses — SiO2
Gaussian dispersion analysis was primarily developed for modeling the broad-
band dispersion of glasses, e.g.
[8]. Native silicon oxide (SiO2) ﬁlms are
among the optical material elements that require accurate broadband dis-
persion characterization for many photonic applications. The actual values
of the refractive index can vary due to the manufacturing process and pres-
ence of defects in samples (e.g., see the 3-Gaussian and 8-Gaussian models in
Fig. 6 ﬁtted to diﬀerent data sets). The general absorption bands are caused
by OH groups and are relatively consistent at: 2.8, 3.5, and 4.3 µm. The 9,
12.5 and 22 µm absorption bands are due to vibration modes. An impres-
sive literature review of silica experimental data and models for wavelengths
spanning from 30 nm to 1000 µm is done in [71]. As a result of this extensive
review, the authors developed a dispersion model for silica with 8 Gaussian
oscillators that covers extremely broadband range from 5 to 50 µm.

Gaussian absorption peaks. (c,f) Approximation errors for CO models of diﬀerent orders
n = 2, ..., 8.

In some photonic applications, it is possible to neglect minor spectral
features in favour of more computationally-eﬃcient models. These models
include fewer additional oscillators, but cover more general cases or the av-
erage response of multiple samples. Many practical multi-sample dispersion
models that contain Gaussian terms are obtained using VASE characteri-
zation techniques. For example, a compact model was extracted by J. A.
Woollam Co. from multi-sample VASE analysis of native SiO2 as discussed
in [73]. This example covers a broad spectral range (0.19 – 33 µm), contains
a Sellmeier pole in the UV (at ∼ 0.11 µm), and a set of three Gaussian terms
in the IR (at ∼ 8.86 µm, ∼ 9.54 µm, and ∼ 21.3 µm, respectively). Thus,
the lowest-order CO approximation (n = 2) for this model consists of only 7
oscillators total — 1 Sellmeier and 6 coupled oscillators (2 per Gaussian).

To demonstrate the accuracy and eﬃcacy of our CO approximations on
real Gaussian data we used an extreme wideband 8-Gaussian model (8-
Gauss) of fused silica.
In Fig. 6 we compare our Gaussian approximation
to a simpliﬁed Lorentzian ﬁt (with full-width-half-maximum matched to the
Gaussian peaks). The absorption centers are shown with vertical lines. The

spectrum even with the lowest approximation order n = 2, however, the sim-
ple Lorentz substitution of the Gaussian terms with the same FWHM is far
oﬀ. We also tested our model against a more compact 1-Sellmeier 3-Gaussian
model (3-Gauss) of native, thermally grown SiO2 within a narrower range.
We once again found that the CO approximation performs very well in this
case while a simple Lorentz substitution of Gaussian terms performs quite
poorly. The lowest order CO approximation parameters for both the full case
and the compact model case can be found in Table 12).

The question remains whether the higher-order approximations give valid
FDTD-compatible models that could potentially be used if higher accuracy
Gaussian absorption simulations in the time domain are required.
In ﬁg-
ure 6(ef) we plotted the approximation errors for all approximations (n =
2, ..., 8). These plots demonstrate that the error scales nicely on real Gaus-
sian data with approximation order as 10−n. This scaling is in good agree-
ment with the approximation errors of the Dawson function analyzed earlier
(Fig. 3). The maximum error starts at roughly a few percent for n = 2, and
In practical
almost reaches single ﬂoating point precision 1e-7 for n = 8.
cases, measurement deviations for material characterization is often several
percent (comparable to n = 2 approximation), and thus usage of orders
n = 4 and above CO approximations that double (n = 4) and triple (n = 6)
the number of additional oscillators may be computationally impractical and
unneeded for time-domain implementation.

To implement the native SiO2 material model discussed previously (1 Sell-
meier, 3 Gaussian Terms) in a time-domain solver we again use the n = 2, ..., 8
order CO approximations for each of the Gaussian terms. These approxima-
tions will require 7, up to 25 oscillators, respectively. The higher-order ap-
proximations are used to demonstrate accuracy convergence and may not be
practical for actual simulations due to additional computational costs. How-
ever, they provide the possibility of extremely precise simulation if needed.
The Sellmeier pole in the model is yet another special case of a second-order
GDM term (11) with bi
1 = 0 [29]. All the approximation parameters can
be generated using the included MADIS codes and imported into external
time-domain Maxwell solvers.

The approximation models are tested with our FDTD-GDM solver to
verify the convergence and stability of the dispersive FDTD simulation. We
use a simple one-dimensional formulation of wave propagation through a 100-
nm ﬁlm of silica. To probe the dispersive response of the material numerically

any of RC/ADE schemes derived in Section 3.2, converge with second order.
In the ﬁgure the numerical error of the bilinear ADE (“ADE2”) scheme is
shown as an example. The demonstration codes are available for download
and can be used to generate and export the approximation coeﬃcients to
other time-domain solvers.

4.2. Metals — Gold Island Films
In plasmonics, the dispersion of metals is traditionally modeled in the time
domain with a Drude term along with several Lorentz terms (DL-model) [75].
Recent works demonstrated that using a combination of a Drude term and
critical points (DCP-model) instead of DL-models provides an improvement

44

in the ﬁtting accuracy and computational eﬃciency due to a reduction in
the number of oscillators required [43, 44, 76]. These recent reports argue
that classical Drude–Lorentz theory is incapable of reproducing in detail the
proﬁles empirically observed for many real metallic materials without the
addition of nonphysical oscillators. This eﬀect is especially evident when
multiple Lorentz oscillators are used to mimic a sharp Gaussian absorption
band [6]. To avoid this issue in our approach we derived a physically mean-
ingful analytic representation of the inhomogeneous broadening, with two
coupled critical points oscillators for each Gaussian term, rather than ﬁtting
the entire ensemble with multiple separate free terms.

Figure 8: Broadband dispersion models for gold island ﬁlms: (a-b) 4-Gaussian oscillator
(4-Gauss) model [18] along with TD compatible approximations: one Lorentz vs. one CO
pair (n = 2) per Gaussian. (c) Approximation error for CO models of diﬀerent orders
n = 2, ..., 8.

For demonstration, we tested our approach for a case when metallic
material dispersion is combined with geometric structural disorder. Semi-
continuous and island metal ﬁlms are an area of active research. The disper-
sion characterization of these ﬁlms is challenging due to the random nature
of the material. It is usually performed as a combination of advanced eﬀec-
tive medium theory and ﬁtting to extensive amounts of experimental data.
It has been shown that the optical constants of island metal ﬁlms can be
successfully obtained by VASE characterization and ﬁtting with a multi-
pole oscillator model that includes Gaussian-type absorption bands. In such
applications, Gaussian-based material models signiﬁcantly outperform con-
ventional Lorentzian ﬁts in terms of residual error. They are also capable
of providing meaningful physical insights into the origin or morphology of
disorder [18].

As a ﬁrst step, we build CO approximations of orders 2 ≤ n ≤ 8 of
the 4-Gauss oscillator model derived for the 7-nm island gold ﬁlm in [18].

To showcase the strength of the CO approximation, we also plot a Lorentz
approximation with a matched FWHM as a comparison. As before, the
Lorentz approximation does not provide acceptable accuracy. However, even
a single CO pair (n = 2) almost completely overlaps with the initial 4-Gauss
model, as can be seen in Fig. 8. The error analysis in Fig. 8(c) is consistent
with the previous examples, showing approximation errors ranging from a
few percent (n = 2) down to single precision (1e-7) for n = 8.

Next, we veriﬁed the CO models in the time-domain for all orders 2 ≤ n ≤
8. FDTD-GDM simulations of a thin 7-nm semi-continuous ﬁlm illuminated
with an incident Gaussian pulse were used to test the model. The pulse
parameters are the same as in Section 4.1, except that the carrier is now
λ0 = 500 nm. All the CO approximations showed ideal 2nd order numerical
convergence across the entire spectrum for all ADE/RC schemes, as shown
in Fig. 9.

4.3. Polymers — DPS-DMS
Polymers are yet another important class of materials with disorder. Gaus-
sian dispersion analysis is widely used for characterizing their optical con-
stants. Here we explore the modeling of diphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane
(DPS-DMS) copolymers, which are commonly used as lubricants and adhe-
sives, along with uses in the semiconductor industry and chromatography.
The DPS-DMS sample was characterized with 2 Sellmeier and 6 Gaussian
poles in [17].

As before, we ﬁrst build the CO approximations of all orders n, 2 to 8,
and check its accuracy vs the exact Gaussian dielectric function, see Fig. 10.
The vertical lines show the locations of the Gaussian peaks. One can clearly
see that the Lorentz approximation performs particularly poorly. The CO
approximations on the other hand have similarly low error values and trends
as the previous examples, along with fast exponential error convergence.

All the TD approximation models, 2 ≤ n ≤ 8, were tested with one-
dimensional Yee-based FDTD codes and follow the theoretical second-order
convergence for a light wave propagating through a thin 20-nm ﬁlm of DPS-
DMS. The results can be seen in Fig. 11. The incident Gaussian probe
pulse, depicted in Fig. 11(b), is 2-fs long with an oﬀset of 11 fs and a carrier
wavelength of 30 nm.

One thing to note is that a full theoretical study regarding the numerical
stability of the CO approximations for Gaussian dispersion in FDTD has

satisﬁed since the phase ϕ = −1.0728 is an approximation constant that does
not depend on the input Gaussian parameters [A, Ω, σ]. Constraint (ii) is in
agreement with the general limitations of GDA analysis previously discussed
in Section 2.1.

To summarize: we have numerically veriﬁed that the proposed Gaussian
approximations of order 2 ≤ n ≤ 8 enable eﬃcient TD simulations with con-
trollable accuracy. This technique works stably and equally well for three
diﬀerent groups of materials: glasses, metals, and polymers, with similar
approximation and simulation errors. This method works even for models
with large numbers of Gaussian terms across extremely broadband spectral
ranges. Furthermore, besides the conventional Yee’s FDTD scheme demon-
strated here, our approximations can be coupled with other in-house and
commercial time-domain solvers to simulate broadband Gaussian material
models. This approach enables quick conversion of a signiﬁcant compendium

5. Program Description

This section provides a description of the ﬁles included in the program pack-
age MADIS — MAterial DIspersion Simulator. Input and output parameters
are listed in the tables below for each m-ﬁle in the package. For installation
unzip the ﬁles into your program folder. The package does not have any li-
brary dependencies and should work in any version of MATLAB. The package
was prepared in version 2020b, but was also tested in older versions includ-
ing: 2017a, 2018a, and 2019a. A usage example and test run are included in
the m-script TestRun.m. This script demonstrates a full simulation workﬂow
— from the construction of the time-domain Gaussian approximation models
to the FDTD simulation and reﬂection/transmission post-processing.

5.1. Exact Gaussian Model (Gauss.m)
Function Gauss.m calculates the total permittivity consisting of one or more
Gaussian terms (2-3). The output parameter is εG(ω) = (cid:80)

and χG(ω, i) = χ(cid:48)
G(ω, i), see Section 2.1 for more details. Exact
calculation of the Dawson function is performed using the McCabe algo-
rithm [49]. Alternatively, the Dawson function may also be computed with a
much slower built-in MATLAB function dawson(x) (introduced in R2014a).
A summary of the parameters and outputs of the function Gauss.m is
given in Table 4. Parameters [w, W, sig] should be in the same units (e.g. all
in eV, all in rad/s, etc).

5.2. Approximate Gaussian Model (Gauss n.m)
Function Gauss n.m is a time-domain compatible n-th order approximation
i χn
of the total Gaussian permittivity: εn
G(ω, i) ≈ εG(ω). For each
i-th Gaussian term, χn
G(ω, i), it uses a constrained minimax rational ap-
proximation of order n from 2 to 8 for the Dawson function, Eqns. (24,

causal approximate complex function εn
G(ω) is restored via Hilbert trans-
form, as described in Section 3.1, with the resulting approximation coeﬃ-
cients summarized in Tables 9-11. As shown in Section 4, the lowest or-
der, n = 2, gives an accuracy around a few percent and is suﬃcient for
most applications. Higher accuracy, < 1% and down to machine single
precision (1e-7), can be achieved with 3 ≤ n ≤ 8 if needed. Along with
the approximate relative permittivity εn
G(ω) ≈ εG(ω), the function returns
the real coeﬃcients [a0,i, a1,i, b0,i, b1,i] representing its GDM representation,
G(ω) = (cid:80)
i (a0,i − ιωa1,i) / (b0,i − ιωb1,i − ω2), see Section 2.2 and Eq. (21)
εn
for more details. Using this representation, the multi-term Gaussian model
can be eﬃciently implemented in time domain solvers.

A summary of the parameters and outputs of the function Gauss n.m is
given in Table 5. As before, parameters [w, W, sig] should be in the same
consistent units (e.g. all in eV, all in rad/s, etc), which will deﬁne the units
of the output parameters [a0, a1, b0, b1].

5.3. Prototype of an FDTD Implementation (FDTD1D.m)
Function FDTD1D.m is an FDTD-GDM Maxwell solver implemented in 1D
for simplicity of demonstration. This function is designed as a prototypical
example of how our GDM time-domain Gaussian model may be implemented
in a TD Maxwell solver. It is also used to test the convergence and stability of
the generated material models. These models can consist of a large number
of oscillator terms (e.g. an extreme test with a high approximation order
n = 8 and 8 Gauss terms produces 64 oscillators) and requires direct testing
in a TD solver. The FDTD-GDM implementation is described in detail in
Section 3.2.

In particular, this code is built to simulate propagation of a normally
incident Gaussian pulse (59) deﬁned in struct S. The pulse is incident on a
ﬁlm of material with thickness Fthick with dispersive relative permittivity in
GDM format (21) deﬁned in struct D. The parameter ppf refers to the points
per ﬁlm and deﬁnes the spatial discretization step as Fthick/ppf. Finally,
the solver parameter may be set to “ADE”, “ADE2”, “TRC”, “TRC2”,
“PCRC2”, or “PLRC”, as described in Section 3.2.

This function returns three simulated electric ﬁeld probes, Eri, Et, and
Ei as arrays over time — the array index represents the time step from the
beginning of the simulation. Probe Eri is the sum of reﬂected and incident
electric ﬁeld collected in front of the ﬁlm. Probe Et is the transmitted electric
ﬁeld collected behind the ﬁlm. Probe Ei is the incident electric ﬁeld in
front of the ﬁlm. The returned values also include exact locations (adjusted
to the numerical mesh) where each probe was recorded and the location
of the ﬁlm — this is needed for the second-order accurate post-processing
with phase correction (62). A typical mistake often committed during post-
processing is to not take into account half-cell or several-cell phase shifts and
thus have only ﬁrst-order convergence in the resulting reﬂection/transmission
coeﬃcients. Parameter Xf = [Xf(1), Xf(2)] returns the exact location of
the beginning and end of the ﬁlm in the simulation. Parameter Xp = [Xp(1),
Xp(2), Xp(3)] returns the exact locations where probes Eri, Et, and Ei
were recorded, respectively. By default, Eri and Ei are set to be 2 cells
before the ﬁlm and Et is 2 cells after the ﬁlm, while the source is located 5
cells away from the front of the ﬁlm. Finally, dt refers to the time step used
for the simulation. The time step is computed assuming a default maximum
Courant number of 1 that can be changed in the function as needed.

A summary of the parameters and outputs of this function is given in

Table 6.

5.4. Analytic RT Calculation (RT.m)
Function RT.m analytically computes the reﬂection and transmission coef-
ﬁcients of a ﬁlm at normal incidence (60). This function is included for
numerical error analysis and to check the convergence order. Numerical er-
ror is calculated based on the functions RT.m and RTnum.m. The RT function
requires the input frequencies ω in rad/s, the ﬁlm thickness h in meters, and
the relative permittivity of the ﬁlm ε at frequencies ω. This function returns
a reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcient for each ω inputted. A summary of
the parameters and outputs of this function is found in Table 7.

ﬁeld probes simulated by FDTD solver, (Er, Et, Ei) and the position of the
probes and the ﬁlm (Xp, Xf) returned by FDTD1D.m along with the simulation
time step dt. The returned arrays of reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients
correspond to the returned ω frequency array. A summary of the parameters

5.6. Example Simulation Script (TestRun.m)
Script TestRun.m is the example program replicating the Silica example from
Section 4. A successful run will reproduce Figures 6, 7. The logical program
ﬂow of simulation with MADIS is shown in Figure 12. First the frequency
domain Gaussian models must be inputted. These are usually obtained from
ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles to the experimental ellipsometry data. Once the
frequency domain model has been constructed the parameters are fed into
Gauss n.m for conversion of the Gaussian parameters into time-domain solver
compatible GDM form deﬁned by parameters (a0,a1,b0,b1). At this point, the
GDM model obtained can be adapted for use in other TD solvers, commercial
or custom. Once the GDM TD parameters are found, the included FDTD-
GDM implementation (FDTD1D.m) is used to simulate a Gaussian pulse pass-
ing through a thin ﬁlm of the modelled material. Function FDTD1D.m returns
the simulated electric ﬁeld probes which are then post processed by RTnum.m
into the reﬂection and transmission spectral curves.

6. Conclusions

Over the last several decades, active research has revealed the advantages
of employing Gaussian distributions in the approximation of diverse optical
material systems with disorder. Recent theoretical and experimental stud-
ies have improved the causality foundations and real-life validity of dielectric
functions utilizing the diﬀerence of two (i) shifted Gaussian absorption peaks
and (ii) matching, Hilbert-transformed, Dawson functions. Thus far, the
Dawson-Gaussian oscillator model has been obtained solely in the frequency
domain. There is no direct analog for time-domain multiphysics comput-
ing schemes which severely limits time-domain simulations of many common
materials.

This work builds upon existing work by adapting the frequency-domain
Dawson-Gaussian material model to the time-domain. This is done via ap-
proximations described by auxiliary diﬀerential equations or recursive con-
volutions. Our time-domain compatible approximations for materials with
Gaussian absorption bands is developed within our generalized dispersive
material (GDM) model framework. This approach uses constrained mini-
max rational approximations that minimize the number of oscillators needed

This resulting models involve sums of paired phase-
relaxed harmonic oscillators with matching amplitudes, phases, and a shared
damping parameter with or without a Lorentzian center. The coeﬃcients of
the approximation models are explicit functions of the Gaussian parameters
— amplitude, oﬀset, and broadening of the original Gaussian peak. This
model’s time-domain implementation requires only two second-order auxil-
iary diﬀerential equations per Gaussian peak and is accurate to within several
percent error. The accuracy can be increased exponentially by adding more
oscillators — up to 8 per Gaussian peak.

In addition to time-domain applications, the proposed conversion also
makes the approximation of the Dawson-Gaussian model extremely eﬃcient
in the frequency domain. The approximation of the Dawson function with a
rational polynomial, enables ultra-fast optimization of spectral FD approxi-
mations. Such optimization is employed in a variety of practical problems of
applied spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry.

Note that this paper considers isotropic nonmagnetic media for explana-
tory simplicity and its application to optics. However, the proposed concept
can be employed to model more general materials with dispersive permittiv-
ity and permeability or materials with each component of their anisotropic
and bi-anisotropic tensor described as a ﬁnite GDM sum (including the GDM
representation of Gaussian terms).

The supplied codes named: MADIS (MAterial DIspersion Simulator) con-
tain all necessary MATLAB functions to convert a Gaussian-based model into
a time-domain compatible form. These codes also include a one-dimensional
Maxwell FDTD solver for the post-conversion time-domain testing of the dis-
persion model. The package enables seamless implementation of Gaussian-
based models normally retrieved from VASE ﬁtting tools into custom and
commercial time-domain solvers such as Lumerical FDTD.

Our new TD approximation of Gaussian absorption also provides insight
into the physics of Gaussian broadened Lorentzian lineshapes. Equation (40)
explicitly demonstrates that the transition of a classical TD Lorentzian re-
sponse into an approximate Gaussian proﬁle is achieved as a ﬁrst-order cor-
rection, employing an additional, slowly-varying modulation factor. It is this
factor that eﬀectively enables the transition from Gaussian-like inhomoge-
neously broadened proﬁle to a Lorentzian lineshape homogeneously broad-
ened (ω → ω + ιΓ). In the frequency domain, a diﬀerent smooth transition
between the Gaussian and Lorentzian proﬁles was implemented by Kim et
al. [40] but it has no time-domain conversion.

55

Furthermore, the suggested approximation algorithm with minimax op-
timization and analytically derived modulated oscillators can be applied to
other types of inhomogeneous broadening, with other broadening distribu-
tions, e.g. Fermi or Boltzmann distributions.

In conclusion, approximating a Gaussian-based dielectric function with
pairs of phase-relaxed harmonic oscillators, allows for the implementation of
several FDTD-based numerical schemes with controllable accuracy. Experiment-
based real-life material examples including glasses, metals, and polymers
were presented to demonstrate our techniques eﬃcacy. As such we believe
that the proposed method has immediate applicability for broadband time-
domain modeling in a variety of photonic systems including conventional
and doped glasses, polymers, semiconductors, metals, and composite mate-
rials with structural disorder. Essentially, if the model has Gaussian terms
caused by molecular, structural, or geometric disorder this method provides
a computationally eﬃcient, stable, and physically consistent method of sim-
ulation in the time-domain.

Figure 13:
(a) Comparison of relative errors of Lether’s near-minimax approximation [55]
and our minimax approximation for the Dawson function F (x). Lether’s approximation
obtained by the modiﬁed Remez algorithm gives a slight deviation from our perfect mini-
max proﬁle found numerically and results in larger maximum error. (b) In order to build a
causal approximation, we take Hilbert transform of the Dawson’s minimax approximation
Gn(x) = − 2√
which approximates Gaussian function. By plotting the
additive inverse of Gn(x) in log scale, we analyze the “criminal” negative values in the ap-
proximation, which are not present in the exact Gaussian function G(x) = e−x2
> 0. In the
picture positive values of Gn(x) go to NaN and cause blank segments in the curves, so only
negative values are plotted. Although segments of negative values do exist in the approxi-
mation curves Gn(x) (and are inﬁnitely long for even n approximations without Lorentzian
center), they go to zero exponentially fast with order n. (c) Same behaviour is inherited
in the absorption of the approximated dielectric function ε(cid:48)(cid:48)
n(ω) = Gn(ω − Ω) − Gn(ω + Ω)
— small negative absorption exists but goes to zero exponentially fast.

4. Derivation of the RC recursion (51) for a single pole,

We start from convolution integral (48) for P(t + τ ) with χ(t) = AeBtθ(t)

6. Derivation of the universal compact FDTD scheme (58)

We start from the universal formulation (57) for which the coeﬃcients
αi,j, βi,j were derived in Sections 3.2.1-3.2.2 for diﬀerent ADE and RC
methods and summarized in Table 2. In this formulation we will assume
the case of one second-order term P = Pi, since the case of single pole
(a0 = b0 = 0) and generalization to the full sum are obvious,
