ABSTRACT

The simplistic but ubiquitous Mixing Length Theory (MLT) formalism is used to model convective
energy transport within 1D stellar evolution calculations. The formalism relies on the free parameter
αMLT, which must be independently calibrated within each stellar evolution program and for any
given set of physical assumptions. We present a solar calibration of αMLT appropriate for use with the
ÆSOPUS opacities, which have recently been made available for use with the MESA stellar evolution
software. We report a calibrated value of αMLT = 1.931 and demonstrate the impact of using an
appropriately calibrated value in simulations of a 3M(cid:12) asymptotic giant branch star.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Mixing Length Theory of convection (MLT) was ﬁrst applied to stellar interiors by Erika Boehm-Vitense (Vitense
1953) and remains one of few we have for approximating convection in 1D stellar models on evolutionary timescales
(along with, e.g., the Full Spectrum of Turbulence model of Canuto & Mazzitelli 1991; Canuto et al. 1996). The MLT
formalism contains a free parameter, αMLT, that can be thought of as characterizing the “eﬃciency of convection,”
or the “mean-free path” of a ﬂuid parcel by analogy with molecular heat transfer (Prandtl 1925). As αMLT does not
have a physical meaning in 3D ﬂuid dynamics, it must be calibrated empirically. Most often, and for obvious reasons,
this calibration is performed to the Sun (though exceptions include Joyce & Chaboyer 2018a,b). However, as αMLT
may absorb modeling inconsistencies or inherit other artifacts from the environment in which it is used, αMLT must
be calibrated anew for each stellar evolution code and for each choice of input physics–especially when the physical
assumptions heavily impact the outer layers of stars: regions where the temperature gradient becomes superadiabatic
(see, e.g., Jermyn et al. 2022 for detailed discussion). Diﬀerent choices of opacities, for example, will therefore require
diﬀerent solar mixing length calibrations.

2. METHODS

This note is a tangential result from the work of Cinquegrana, Joyce and Karakas (2022, in prep), wherein MESA
is used to model high- (i.e. super-solar) metallicity intermediate mass and massive stars. We discuss here the relevant
physics for this science case as well as the variations applied for the current demonstration.

2.1. Software tools

The ÆSOPUS: Accurate Equation of State and OPacity Utility Software (Marigo & Aringer 2009) tool allows users
to create low-temperature Rosseland mean opacity tables customized to the situation they are modelling by, e.g.,
choosing diﬀerent CNO abundances or alpha-element enhancement levels. The necessity of using low-temperature
opacity tables that can follow composition changes along the evolution of a star, rather than relying on the star’s
initial metal content, has been reiterated by numerous groups over the past two decades (e.g., Marigo 2002; Cristallo
et al. 2007; Ventura & Marigo 2009; Constantino et al. 2014; Fishlock et al. 2014). The importance of this feature
is especially apparent when modeling thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which undergo various
processes such as third dredge up and hot bottom burning that signiﬁcantly change the chemical composition of the
envelope from its initial chemical makeup (for further details on AGB stars, see: Busso et al. 1999; Herwig 2005;
Nomoto et al. 2013; Karakas & Lattanzio 2014; Karakas et al. 2022; Cinquegrana & Karakas 2022; Ventura et al.
2022). Such opacity tables have also proved useful in modelling R Coronae Borealis stars, which have envelopes
deﬁcient of hydrogen but enhanced in CNO elements (Schwab 2019). The impacts of using appropriate opacities in

Figure 1. Two 3M(cid:12), solar metallicity models are compared: one with αMLT=1.931 (continuous line) and one with αMLT = 2.0
(dashed line). The left panel shows the stellar tracks of the two models. The right panels shows the variance of the helium
burning luminosity and radius as the models approach the thermally pulsing AGB.

these situations further extend to stellar yield calculations as well as predictions for envelope expansion, mass loss
rates and stellar lifetimes.

The ÆSOPUS tool has been available since 2009, however the integration of ÆSOPUS with the Modules for Experi-
ments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA; Paxton et al. 2010, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019) software is recent (MESA Instrument
Paper VI, in prep). Schwab (2019) was the ﬁrst to publish science utilising ÆSOPUS within MESA, however, there is
currently no commentary on the appropriate mixing length to use with these opacities published in the literature.

2.2. Physical conﬁguration

We perform a solar calibration of αMLT using MESA version 15140 (Paxton et al. 2019). Opacities are scaled
according to the abundances of Lodders (2003). We determine the best-ﬁtting mixing length by comparing a number
of solar models, each adopting a diﬀerent mixing length and initial helium abundance, Yinitial. All models are assigned
Zinitial = 0.0133 per the solar metallicity determination of Lodders (2003) for consistency with the ÆSOPUS opacity
assumptions.

Initial helium abundances from 0.2377 to 0.28 are considered (for discussion of varying Yinitial as part of mixing
length calibrations, see Joyce & Chaboyer (2018a), Trampedach et al. (2014), and references therein). The base metal
content for the opacity tables, Zbase, is set equal to Zinitial. OPAL data are used for high temperature opacities
(Iglesias & Rogers 1996); low temperature opacities are built using the ÆSOPUS tool (Marigo & Aringer 2009). 1

All models used for the solar calibration have 1M(cid:12) and terminate at the solar age, but are otherwise identical to
the physical prescription described above and adopted in Cinquegrana, Joyce & Karakas (2022, in prep). Using the
MLT prescription of Henyey et al. (1965), values are iterated until some combination of Yinitial and αMLT reproduces
the solar radius and solar luminosity at the solar age to approximately 1 part in 104.
Reference values for solar fundamental parameters used in this work are as follows:

• t(cid:12) = 4.57 × 109 years (Bahcall et al. 1995);
• L(cid:12) = 3.846 × 1033 erg s−1 (Willson 1997); and
• R(cid:12) = 6.95508 × 1010 cm (Brown & Christensen-Dalsgaard 1998).

These are collated in Christensen-Dalsgaard (2021).

Solar calibration of αMLT using ÆSOPUS opacities in MESA

For each composition assumption, we run a suite of models adopting αMLT values between 1.3 and 2.2. We extract
the luminosity and radius at the solar age, t(cid:12). We then determine which choice of αMLT produces the best reproduction
of solar parameters according to a penalty statistic that prioritizes agreement with the solar radius and solar luminosity
equally. The precision on αMLT is increased until further reﬁnement no longer reduces the residuals in luminosity and
radius. We ﬁnd that a combination of Yinitial = 0.241 and αMLT = 1.931 performs best.

4. IMPLICATIONS

Composition-dependent opacity tables, such as those provided by ÆSOPUS, are crucial when modelling AGB stars.
The reliability of AGB stellar models therefore depends on using a value of αMLT that is appropriately calibrated for
use with those opacities. In particular, the mixing length is known to have a large impact on derived quantities such as
the eﬀective temperature and radius (Karakas & Lattanzio 2014; Joyce et al. 2020), the eﬃciency of the third dredge
up (Boothroyd & Sackmann 1988), and the strength of hot bottom burning (Ventura & D’Antona 2005). Using an
inappropriate αMLT can therefore lead to inaccurate predictions for fundamental stellar parameters.

This is demonstrated in Fig. 1, which compares the evolutionary properties of two 3M(cid:12) (Z =Z(cid:12)) models: one with
αMLT = 1.931 and one with MESA’s default value of αMLT = 2.0. In the left panel, we note little diﬀerence in their
tracks along the main sequence, though variance in luminosity and temperature is apparent once the models ascend
their giant branches. However, when evolved until the hydrogen envelope is less than 20% of the total stellar mass,
(e.g., the post-AGB EEP as deﬁned in Dotter (2016)), we note that the αMLT = 2.0 model has experienced 35 thermal
pulses by this point, compared to the 36 thermal pulses of the model with αMLT = 1.931. As the models evolve along
the thermally pulsating AGB, we also see modest variation in radius, eﬀective temperature and the magnitude of the
helium burning luminosity.

More striking, however, is the impact of decreasing αMLT on the evolutionary timescales. The model that assumes a
calibrated αMLT value produces an earlier second dredge up event and shows an earlier onset of thermal pulses. Changes
in timescale carry implications for stellar lifetimes and thus for nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution timescales.

In light of the clear physical changes imparted to the models by a seemingly modest absolute change in αMLT, we

provide a working “best practices” value of αMLT = 1.931 for use with ÆSOPUS low-temperature opacities.

APPENDIX

The ÆSOPUS software is available online at http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/aesopus. The tables used in this work

were computed using the following options.

A. INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR ÆSOPUS TABLES

We set logT from 3.2 to 4.5. Increments of 0.01 dex are used from 3.2 to 3.7; 0.05 dex is used above this. Similarly,

logR extends from −7 to 1 in increments of 0.5 dex.

A.1. Temperature and density grid

A.2. Chemical composition

We use the reference solar composition of Lodders (2003). We solve for reference metallicities of 0.014 to 0.10, given
the high metallicities required for our science case. We set hydrogen abundance, X, from 0.4 to 0.8 in steps of 0.1.
We do not change the abundance normalization and primordial mixture options. For the reference mixture, we choose
scaled-solar, but leave the associated table uncompleted. We do not deﬁne any additional enhancement or depletion
factors in the superimposed chemical pattern table.

The last option is for CNO abundance variation factors, where fc and fn are scaling factors applied to the reference
abundance (see Marigo & Aringer (2009); Fishlock et al. (2014) for more detailed discussion). We note that the
following values depend heavily on the mass, metallicity and evolutionary stage under consideration. In our case, none

of our AGB models with 0.04 ≥ Zref ≥ 0.10 become carbon rich (C/O > 1), so we do not account for fc values greater
than 0.6. Solar metallicity AGB models, on the other hand, are very capable of exceeding this threshold, so in that
case we extend fc > 1. For 0.04 ≥ Zref ≥ 0.10, we set fc = −0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and fn = 0, 0.4, 0.7. For Zref =
0.014, we set fc = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.5 and fn = 0, 0.4, 0.7.
