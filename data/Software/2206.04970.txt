Abstract. A new class of conformal invariants for a given spacetime M is introduced ex-
ploiting the conformal geometry of any light ray Γ. Each congruence of light rays passing
through a given point p deﬁnes the sky S(p) of such point. The new conformal invariants are
deﬁned on the bunlde of skies of the spacetime M , being called sky invariants accordingly.
The natural conformal covariant derivative deﬁned on a light ray and its associated covariant
calculus allows us show the existence of a natural conformal invariant diﬀerential of arc that,
together with the restriction of the curvature of the conformal covariant derivative, can be
used to construct a sky invariant that will be called the sky curvature. An algorithm, that can
be implemented on any symbolic manipulation software system, to compute the sky curvature
will be discussed and the main ideas and the explicit computation of the sky curvature are
illustrated in Schwarzschild spacetime.

One of the reasons of the signiﬁcance of conformal invariants in the study of the geometry of
Lorentzian geometry and gravitation is the fact that the causal properties of a given spacetime
depend solely on its conformal structure. Conformal invariants which are polynomial on the
metric tensor and its derivatives were thoroughly described by Feﬀerman and Clarke [Fe85]
culminating a long an arduous road started by Weyl and others more than half a century before
(see, for instance [Sz68] and references therein).

The study of the space of light rays of a given spacetime M oﬀers an alternative way of looking
at its causal structure, an idea that has its origin in R. Penrose’s intuition and was brought to
fruition by the hand of R. Low [Lo88, Lo89, Lo90, Lo94, Lo00, Lo06] and the recent results

THE SKY INVARIANT: A NEW CONFORMAL INVARIANT FOR SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME

N

obtained by the authors [Ba14, Ba15].
In particular, in [Ba15] it was proved that the causal
structure of a strongly causal sky separating spacetime is determined by a partial order relation
on its space of skies and that the conformal class of the metric structure is completely determined
by its inﬁnitesimal sky structure [Ba14]. All these observations bring us the question if a search
for conformal invariants program similar to that developed in the setting of the spacetime itself,
could be started working on the space of light rays itself

, the “causal dual” of M .

N

The present paper oﬀers a preliminary partial answer to this question by constructing a new
conformal invariant, called the sky conformal invariant, or the sky-invariant for short, which is
constructed using the geometrical ingredients available on the space
of light rays of M . The
main notion behind it is to construct a “Ricci”-like tensor on the tangent spaces to the skies of
events on M . Such construction is inspired on the observation that for any parametrisation of a
light ray Γ there is a metric g that makes it g-geodesic and which is unique up to multiplicative
factor along the geodesic, hence for light rays a natural conformal covariant derivative can be
deﬁned, the so called Fermi-Walker connection. Analyzing the structure of such conformal co-
variant derivative it will be shown that there is a canonical conformal invariant parametrisation
obtained fromt the canonical projective parametrisation derived from the vanishing of the natural
Ricci tensor associated to it. Such conformal covariant derivative, combined with the conformal
parametrisation of light rays, allows to deﬁne a natural (1, 1)-tensor Cx : T S(x)
T S(x) on
an open set of the tangent bundle to the sky S(x), for any x
M that will be called the sky
curvature. The principal elements of such tensor are the new conformal invariants we exhibit in
this paper.

∈

It is relevant to point out here that this approach to construct the new conformal invariants
is reminiscent of work done by Agrachev and collaborators on Jacobi curves and curvature
invariants [Ag02, Ag08, Ag15]. Their relation to the present work will be discussed elsewhere.

The actual computation of these new invariants poses, in principle, signiﬁcant diﬃculties as
the explicit computations of the invariants would require the solution of non-linear diﬀerential
equations, however, most of these complications can be circumvented and explicit formulae will
be obtained for them that only require the computation of higher order derivatives of tensorial
objects. With the help of symbolic manipulation software, explicit expressions can be found and
this procedure will be illustrated working them for Schwarzschild’s spacetime.

The paper will be organised as follows. In Sect. 1 the main concepts and notations concerning
the space of light rays will be succinctly reviewed. In Sect. 2 the conformal geometry of a light
ray and its canonical conformal covariant derivative will be discussed. It will be shown that a
canonical conformal parametrisation of light rays can be constructed and some of its properties
will be discussed. In Sect. 3 the natural curvature (1, 1) tensor on the tangent bundle of skies
will be introduced and explicit formulas for its calculation will be presented. Sect. 4 will be
devoted to sketch an algorithm to compute the sky-invariant of a given spacetime and, ﬁnally,
Sect. 5 will show the results obtained for Schwarzschild spacetime.

There is a natural way of constructing sky conformal invariants associated to the geometrical
structure of light rays. Consider a light ray Γ and a parametrisation γ(t) of it and suppose that
we have a map κγ(t) such that κφ◦γ(t) = κγ(t), and κγ(t+a) = κγ(t) for all a; we will say that κγ
is a parametric conformal invariant. If, in addition, κγ(t) is invariant under reparametrisations
of γ(t), that is, if ¯γ(¯t) = γ(ψ(¯t)) = γ(t), is another parametrisation of Γ (that is, t = ψ(¯t), is a
regular, future oriented, reparametrisation of t), then κ¯γ(¯t) = κγ(t), we will say that κγ is an
absolute conformal invariant.

→

If κγ is an absolute conformal invariant it is obvious that it deﬁnes a map (denoted with the
same symbol) κ : PN+
R, by means of κ(α) = κγα(0), where γα(t) is the null g-geodesic such
that γα(0) = π(α) = p, and ˙γα(0) = u, if α = [u] (notice that two geodesics satisfying the
previous conditions correspond to two diﬀerent parametrisations of the same light ray Γα) and
κ is a sky conformal invariant. Hence, absolute conformal invariants κγ deﬁne sky invariants κ.
This constitutes the main idea behind our strategy to construct sky conformal invariants: exploit
the conformal geometry of light rays to construct absolute conformal invariants in the previous
sense, that will give rise to sky conformal invariants. The details of the construction of absolute
conformal invariants will be discussed in the following sections.

2. The conformal geometry of a light ray

2.1. Metric adapted to a parametrised light ray. Note that if Γ is a light-ray and we
parametrise it using a regular future oriented parameter t, i.e., Γ is the image of a parametrised
curve γ = γ(t), with ˙γ(t)
such that
γ(t) is a null geodesic for g. Finally, if a change of parameter t = ψ(¯t) is performed on the curve
γ(t), i.e., ¯γ(¯t) = γ(ψ(¯t)), then a simple computation shows:

= 0, g(T (t), ˙γ(t)) < 0, for all t, then there is a metric g

∈ C

g¯γ(t)(¯t) = e2ϕ(¯t)gγ(t)(ψ(¯t)) ,

where,

ϕ(¯t) =

On the other hand, the coeﬃcients κk(t) of the characteristic polynomial pγ(s) = det(Rγ(t)
−
sI), allows us to deﬁne a family of functions κγ,k(t) on each light ray Γ, as the kth coeﬃcient
of the characteristic polynomial of Rγ(t), and γ(t) a parametrisation of Γ. We will call such
functions parametric curvatures and they are invariant under translations of the parameter.
Again because of the conformal nature of the covariant derivative along Γ, it is satisﬁed that
κγ,k(t) = κφ◦γ,k(t) for any conformal diﬀeomorphism φ. Thus, the functions κγ,k(t) deﬁne a
family of parametric conformal invariants that will be called parametric sky curvatures.

∈

In particular we can deﬁne two parametric curvatures: ργ(t) = det Rγ(t) = κγ,m−2(t), and
1)m−3κγ,1(t), which are the only scalars associated to the linear map

δγ(t) = Tr(Rγ(t)) = (
Rγ(t) in four dimensions (note the if m = 4, the dimension of skies is 2).

−

In principle, the parametric curvatures κγ,k are not absolute conformal invariants, that is,
they are not invariant under reparametrisations of Γ. The reason for this is that if t = ψ(¯t), we
get (after a simple but subtle computation):

family of sky invariants κk : PN+
parametrisation of a light ray Γ is already hard as it involves determining a metric g
that
makes them g-geodesic. We will see in the following paragraphs, that both diﬃculties can be
solved simultaneously by introducing a particular family of parametrisations that would allow
us to turn the parametric conformal invariants κγ,k into absolute ones and at the same time will
provide an algorithmic way to compute them.

THE SKY INVARIANT: A NEW CONFORMAL INVARIANT FOR SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME

We will say that a parametrisation γP (t) of the light ray Γ is projective if RicγP = 0. In such
case, we will say that t is a projective parameter for Γ. Observe that if ¯ψ = ψ−1, then,

(cid:18)
If ¯t = ψ(t) is a projective parameter, then Ric¯γ = 0, and, because of Eqs. (10,11), we get:

Note that if γP (t) and γP (t′) are two projective parametrisations of Γ, then because of (12),
t′ = (at + b)/(ct + d), ad

We can deﬁne the length of a segment Γ0 of the light ray Γ as follows. Let γP (t) be a projective

The previous deﬁnition is independent of the chosen projective parametrisation. Indeed, if ¯t,
(t = ψ(¯t)) is another projective parameter, then S(ψ) = 0, because of (10), we get:

We may also say that there is a 1-form dsΓ deﬁned on the light ray Γ, that can be written as

6. Conclusions and discussion

A novel notion of conformal invariants has been introduced using the space of light rays
N
associated to a given spacetime M to construct them. More speciﬁcally, the canonical bundle
over the spacetime M whose ﬁbre at each point is the corresponding sky has been used and
the conformal invariants have been constructed exploiting the conformal geometry of light rays.
Each light ray Γ carries a canonical conformal covariant derivative that can be used to construct
an endomorphism Rγ on the tangent spaces of the sky containing it. In addition the existence
of a distinguished parametrisation by a conformal invariant parameter s is used to associate a
family of scalar absolute conformal invariant or, equivalently, of sky conformal curvatures, to the
given spacetime.

The deﬁnition of the conformal parametrisation together with the transformation properties
of the tensors Rγ under reparametrisations allows us to construct an algorithm that can be
implemented on any symbolic manipulation language and that has been successfully used to
compute the sky curvatures of Schwarzschild spacetime.

Other conformal invariants can be obtained from the sky curvature tensor, for instance, its
principal directions. In what sense these new conformal invariants characterise the conformal
class of the original spacetime?

Another set of relevant questions emerge from the notion of conformal invariants themselves,
as the deﬁnition provided in the paper suggest its extension to larger classes of objects, suitably
described using a categorical language, subject that will be discussed elsewhere.
