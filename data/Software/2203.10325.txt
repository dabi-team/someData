Abstract: ALICE is the dedicated heavy-ion experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its
main tracking and particle-identiﬁcation detector is a large volume Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The
TPC has been designed to perform well in the high-track density environment created in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions. In this proceeding, we describe the track reconstruction procedure in ALICE. In
particular, we focus on the two main challenges that were faced during the Run 2 data-taking period
(2015–2018) of the LHC, which were the baseline ﬂuctuations and the local space charge distortions in the
TPC. We present the corresponding solutions in detail and describe the software tools that allowed us to
circumvent these challenges.

In this proceeding, we will focus on the so-called combined tracking procedure, which
uses the central barrel detectors; the Inner Tracking System (ITS), the Time Projection Chamber
(TPC), which is the main tracking detector, the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and the
Time-Of-Flight (TOF). The track reconstruction is based on the Kalman Filter approach [3,4],
which consists of three steps as depicted in Figure 1. The tracking starts with the track seeding
in the outermost pad rows of the TPC. The seed is then propagated inwards towards the
primary vertex through the TPC volume and the ITS layers. Then, a second propagation step is
performed in the outward direction from the innermost ITS layer to the outer detectors (TRD
and TOF).

Finally, the primary tracks are reﬁtted back to the primary vertex or as close to the vertex
as possible in the case of secondary tracks. The improvement in pT resolution after applying
a vertex constraint and including the TRD in the track ﬁtting are shown in the left and right
panels of Figure 2, respectively. The vertex constraint signiﬁcantly improves the resolution

of TPC standalone tracks, while it has no effect on ITS–TPC tracks (green and blue square
overlap). Including TRD in the tracking improves the resolution by about 40% at high pT for
pp collisions recorded at both low (12 kHz) and high interaction (230 kHz) rates.

2. Software Tools: Skimmed Data and RootInteractive

Tracking in a high-track density environment requires the efﬁcient handling of large data
samples and efﬁcient software tools. The reconstructed Pb–Pb collision data collected by the
ALICE detector until 2019 is on the level of several Petabytes. To process and calibrate such
a large amount of data, we used the so-called “Skimmed data” approach, which provides a
small-size data sample with sufﬁcient statistics in all phase space containing all the required
information. This is essential for a reliable and fast-turnaround optimization of the calibration
and reconstruction algorithms. The data skimming procedure, which is depicted in orange and
blue in Figure 3, allows for a substantial reduction of the disk space and processing time. More
details will be given in the next paragraphs.

Input data, having a size on the order of several Petabytes, are skimmed down to sev-
eral hundreds of Gigabytes. During this skimming, on the one hand, some of the tracks
are skipped using a physics motivated down-scaling procedure (representative sampling of

On the other hand, additional information from different sources, such as the running
conditions and derived variables obtained using the track and event properties are included
in the ﬁnal tabulated summary data—the so-called “Skimmed Trees”. These skimmed trees
contain unbinned data. They are later converted to smaller n-dimensional histograms, which
are subsequently saved into a tabulated tree (map) with a size on the order of a few Megabytes.
These ﬁnal trees preserve the full potential of the input collision data of several Petabytes.

Figure 3. Workﬂow of the skimmed data and RootInteractive tool.

The ﬁnal product of the skimming procedure described above is tabulated data in the TTree
format, which can easily be converted into other formats, such as “panda”, “numpy”, “csv” etc.
Eventually, it can be used as an input within the so-called “RootInteractive” framework [8].
One of the main advantages of RootInteractive is that it allows for interactive visualization of
multidimensional data in ROOT or native Python formats. More importantly, by integrating
Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms with interactive visualization tools, it makes data analysis
more efﬁcient and effective.

The graphical output of the tool is shown in Figure 4 for illustrative purposes. In this
example, the dependencies of the common-mode effect (see Section 3) for the Gas Electron
Multiplier (GEM)-based TPC [9] are studied using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm [10]. The
tool allows for interactive visualization of eight parameters as sliders below the plots.

Raw data reconstruction and full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation use a large amount of CPU
time. For instance, the reconstruction of the Pb–Pb data sample collected in 2018 took about
ﬁve thousand years of CPU running time. Usually, the optimization of the reconstruction code
is required to tune several parameters, thus, requiring running the reconstruction several times
until the optimal performance is achieved. During the aforementioned data skimming, one can
tag a sub-sample of events (high multiplicity, presence of nuclei, cosmic tracks etc.) that can be
used for calibration purposes. Since the data size is substantially reduced by this tagging, we
were able to run more than 200 different versions of the reconstruction code in parallel with a
turnaround time of a single day.

3. Baseline Fluctuations in the TPC

The TPC signal has two characteristic features: the “ion-tail” and the “common-mode”
effect. The signal induced on the readout pads of the TPC is characterized by a fast rise due
to the ionization produced by the drifting electrons in the high electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of
the anode wire and a long ion-tail (more than 25% of the TPC drift time) due to the motion
of back-drifting positive ions [11]. The magnitude of the negative undershoot caused by this
ion-tail is usually smaller than 1% compared to the pulse height; however, its integral is about
50% of the integral of the signal itself. Therefore, in a high multiplicity environment, this
ion-tail effect causes a signiﬁcant degradation of the following signals on the same readout pad
due to signal pileup.

Like the ion-tail, the common-mode effect also causes a multiplicity-dependent deteriora-
tion of the performance. This occurs due to the capacitive coupling of the anode wires to the
readout pads. Due to this capacitive coupling, discharging and charging of the wires induces
a bipolar signal on all pads facing the same anode wire segment in which the original signal
is detected. The fast rise time of the discharging process causes a simultaneous undershoot.
Figure 5 shows the ion-tail effect for different anode voltage settings (left panel) and two laser
(to study the baseline effects and the signal shape, the Laser calibration system of the TPC was

Particles 2022, 1

used [12]) track clusters on a given pad row, which induces common-mode signals on the other
pads in the same time interval (right panel).

Figure 5. (Color online) Left: normalized pad signals with zoom into the y-axis showing the ion tail for
different anode voltage settings. Right: laser track clusters (integrated over 2000 laser events) in a given
pad-row illustrating the common-mode effect [13].

At high occupancy, both the ion-tail and the common-mode lead to a shift in the baseline.
A toy simulation of a single pad readout in the presence of the ion-tail effect for a high-track
multiplicity environment is illustrated in Figure 6. The performance of the baseline correction
algorithm is shown in the right panel. In the Technical Design Report (TDR) of the TPC, it
was assumed that the current front-end electronics will have a set of online signal processing
algorithms (Moving Average Filter (MAF)) to correct for this baseline shift on the hardware
level [14]. However, this functionality was not enabled due to instabilities in the ﬁrmware.
Consequently, part of the pad signal remained under the zero-suppression threshold and was
lost. This missing charge led to the loss of charge within a cluster and, in some cases, also
to a loss of clusters (e.g., when all pad signals of a cluster were below the zero suppression
threshold).

Eventually, these baseline ﬂuctuations resulted in a signiﬁcant deterioration of the speciﬁc
energy loss (dE/dx) measurement and consequently of the PID performance of the TPC, in
particular, in a high-track density environment. Both of these effects were corrected ofﬂine
during the data reconstruction and taken into account in the simulations at the digitization
level.

line) and corrected (dashed green line) signals [13].

After 2015, the ALICE TPC was operated in Pb–Pb collisions at interaction rates of up to
8 kHz and pp collisions up to 200 MHz. This high interaction rate caused a pileup of interaction

vertices within the TPC readout time and, consequently, a shift in the baseline of the readout
electronics. The pileup of different collisions happens in two distinct natures; “same-bunch-
crossing pileups”, where two (or more) collisions occur in the same bunch crossing, and “out-of
bunch pileups”, where one (or more) collisions occur in bunch crossings different from the one
that triggered the data acquisition.

In the ﬁrst case, the collisions occur near in time with positions that are separated by
up to few cm along the beam direction. These events can be identiﬁed based on multiple
reconstructed vertices from tracks reconstructed in the TPC and ITS. In the case of out-of-bunch
pileup, the collisions occur at different times, and therefore the tracks reconstructed in the TPC
are spatially shifted along the drift direction (due to their different production times) and, in
the vast majority of the cases not prolonged to the ITS, both due to the short readout time of
ITS detectors and to their spatial shift in the TPC.

More than 25% of the Pb–Pb events collected in 2018 were inﬂuenced by out-of-bunch
pileup collisions (while same-bunch pileup is negligible in Pb–Pb collisions at interaction rates
of about 8 kHz). The resulting bias in the measured dE/dx affects several physics analyses, for
which the events with pileup collisions were discarded at the event selection level. Therefore,
it is important to correct for the effect of pileup on dE/dx to achieve optimal PID performance
and avoid having to discard these events.

The left panel of Figure 7 shows the bias induced by pileup in the mean dE/dx values for
the pions belonging to the triggered collision. Depending on whether the pileup interaction
occurred before or after the triggered interaction, the dE/dx values systematically shift in a
different direction. To correct for this effect, an event-by-event basis correction algorithm was
developed.

Using the events with pileup, the deviation in the dE/dx of tracks from the triggered
collision was parameterized in four dimensions; pseudorapidity, TPC dE/dx, the multiplicity
of the pileup event and the relative distance of the pileup collision vertex from the main
interaction vertex along the beam axis. This multi-dimensional map was used to correct for the
bias in the dE/dx values, which was largely eliminated as shown in the right panel of Figure 7.

Figure 7. (Color online) Mean dE/dx values of pions for the events with and without out-of-bunch pileup
before (left) and after (right) dE/dx correction.

As explained above, the common-mode effect and the ion-tail result in a signiﬁcant loss of
information. The reduction in the dE/dx of the detected clusters is recovered by the ofﬂine
correction mentioned above; however, the clusters that were lost because they were below
the zero suppression threshold are not recoverable. Nevertheless, one can still account for
this loss by increasing the cluster error by adding contributions stemming from baseline
ﬂuctuations. In this way, the efﬁciency of cluster-to-track assignment is partially restored. Since

ALI-PERF-500063Particles 2022, 1

7

this problem mainly affects the particle detection efﬁciency, the full MC simulations must be
treated accordingly.

Given its particular shape, the ion-tail produces a baseline bias that depends on pseudora-
pidity, dE/dx, momentum and track density. Therefore, a performance parametrization was
carried out in multiple dimensions using the RootInteractive tool. Figure 8 shows the compari-
son of the Pb–Pb data and the corresponding MC productions in terms of the cluster ﬁnding
efﬁciency before and after the baseline correction mentioned above. The observed discrepancy
between the data and MC was signiﬁcantly reduced by the baseline calibration. Note that
calibration of the detector response in multiple dimensions is an optimization procedure of
the overall performance. Therefore, slight residual imperfections for a given observable are
inevitable.

4. Local Space Charge Distortions

In 2015, signiﬁcant local spatial distortions were observed. These distortions were found
to be caused by space charge accumulation originating from the gap between two adjacent
readout chambers. The resulting deviations of the reconstructed point coordinates (i.e., spatial
positions of the TPC clusters) are on the order of several cm as shown in Figure 9.

This is much larger than the intrinsic resolution, which is on the order of 200 µm. The
local space charge distortions were corrected on average; however, their ﬂuctuations were not
fully eliminated. These ﬂuctuations can be described as

and 9.

To mitigate this problem, the potential at the chamber boundaries was modiﬁed to prevent
electrons from entering the gaps between readout chambers before the 2018 data taking. The
electron drift lines, before and after the modiﬁcation, are shown in Figure 10. This change
in the electric potential led to a defocusing of drifting electrons by a few millimeters at the
chamber edges, thus, resulting in an efﬁciency loss of about 0.5–1%. Moreover, it increased the
diffusion of electrons and decreased the deposited charge on the readout pads. This worsening
of the charge measurements at the chamber boundaries was partially mitigated by increasing
the cluster errors as explained above. Moreover, as will be discussed below, the inclusion of
the TRD in tracking signiﬁcantly improved the tracking performance close to the chamber
boundaries.

5. Using TRD in the Reﬁt

The relative momentum resolution (σpT /pT) of the ALICE barrel tracking depends on

several parameters. In the homogeneous detector approximation, one could write:

with

σpT
pT ≈

pT σq/pT

σq/pT ≈

σrϕ
√Ncl

1
BL2 ⊕

σMS

(2)

(3)

where σq/pT is the inverse transverse momentum resolution, L is the track length (lever arm),
B is the magnetic ﬁeld, Ncl is the number of clusters, σrϕ is the space point resolution in the
bending direction, and σMS is a contribution due to multiple scattering.

The resolution for particles with high momentum (pT > 1 GeV/c) is mainly determined by
the track length (L) and the precision σrϕ of the space point measurement. Contributions due
to multiple scattering are less important at high pT. In combination with a signiﬁcantly longer
TPC+ITS lever arm (LTPC ≈
250 cm) and a much better point resolution,
the combined TPC– ITS tracking is signiﬁcantly more accurate than TPC alone. The relative
improvement in resolution at high momenta (Figure 2 left) is a factor of 3 at 10 GeV/c and a
factor of 6 at pT above 30 GeV/c.

150 cm, LTPC+ITS ≈

However, the momentum resolution in combined tracking is not homogeneous; there are
regions in pseudorapidity and azimuth with much worse resolution. Two typical patterns can
be identiﬁed:

•

•

The resolution is strikingly worse at the sector boundaries (Figure 11 left). At the TPC
sector boundaries, the number of space points is reduced because a fraction of the particle
trajectory traverses dead zones (Figure 12), and the resolution of space points σrϕ at the
edge is also worse due to the lower gain. The resulting effect can be seen in Figure 13. For
short tracks crossing the dead zone (Ncl ≈
50), the momentum resolution is 5–10-times
worse than for long tracks (Ncl > 150).
Due to distortion ﬂuctuations in the region with high distortions (see Figure 9) the effective
point resolution (σrϕ), and thus the resolution parameters are signiﬁcantly worse. The
degradation of the momentum resolution due to this effect is not directly observed; instead,

we show the modulation of the normalized angular resolution in Figure 14 as a function
of the number of the TPC sector, which corresponds to a 20-degree wide azimuthal region.
For high-pT tracks, the inclusion of TRD in the track reﬁt leads to an improvement in
average momentum resolution by about a factor of two, as can be seen in the right panel of
Figure 2. The relative improvement depends on the interaction rate. For data collected at a
higher interaction rate (affected by larger distortion ﬂuctuations), the relative improvement
due to TRD is larger. With TRD in reﬁt, the sector modulation due to distortion ﬂuctuations
is also greatly reduced as shown in Figure 14 for pp collisions at high interaction rate (green
markers compared to magenta points ).

A strong improvement is also seen in Figure 11, which shows the resolution as a function
of relative position (in azimuth) within a TPC sector. When using TRD in the reﬁt (right panel
of Figure 11), the resolution improves by a factor of about 2. Note that the resolution remains
the same if a given track has no hit in TRD, e.g., due to absorption in the detector material,
decay before reaching the TRD or because of crossing a dead zone. The asymmetry observed
close to the sector edges (|q∆sector| > 0.4) results from the bending direction of the tracks.
Depending on the charge (q), the track can bend inside or outside the active area of the TRD
from the dead zone (see Figure 12).

Figure 14. The angular match between the vertex constrained TPC tracks and the ITS tracks at the primary
vertex as a function of the number of TPC sector, which corresponds to a 20-degree wide azimuthal region
as an approximation of the degradation of the combined tracking resolution. The data are normalized to
the low interaction rate data with negligible space charge distortion ﬂuctuations. In the sector regions
2–9 with larger distortions (see Figure 9), the angular agreement is much broader. The degradation was
strongly attenuated by using the TRD in the track ﬁt.

6. Conclusions

The data samples collected during the LHC Run 2 were characterized by high-track
densities inside the TPC due to the high rate of pp collisions, which resulted in the pileup
of several events in the TPC drift time and the high number of particles produced in Pb–Pb
collisions at a center of mass energy of 5.02 TeV. A pileup of collisions in the TPC drift time
was also present in about 25% of the Pb–Pb events collected in 2018, causing a further increase
of the track density in the TPC volume. Calibration of the detector response in such running
conditions is a challenging task for understanding and processing the data. For this, we
developed the advanced software tools, “Skimmed data” and “RootInteractive framework” for
a reliable and fast-turnaround optimization of the calibration and reconstruction algorithms.
The main two detector effects were the baseline ﬂuctuations and the local space-charge
distortions in the TPC, which resulted in signiﬁcant deterioration in the performance of the TPC.
The ﬁrst is a consequence of the two characteristic features of the TPC, the “common-mode”
effect and the ion-tail, while the latter is due to space charge accumulation originating from the
gap between two adjacent readout chambers.

The baseline ﬂuctuations were initially planned to be corrected on the hardware level.
However, this was not realized due to instabilities in the ﬁrmware. Therefore, an algorithm to be
used ofﬂine during the raw data reconstruction was developed. Detailed signal shape studies
allowed us to achieve good matching between the actual and simulated detector response.
Most importantly, the bias in the dE/dx due to pileup events was eliminated allowing us to
recuperate more than 25% of the statistics of Pb–Pb collisions.

The local space charge distortions were mitigated by modifying the potential at the
chamber boundaries to prevent electrons from entering the gaps between readout chambers.
The distortions were fully eliminated with the cost of worsening of the charge measurements at
the chamber boundaries. The TRD was included in the track reﬁt to account for this problem,
which signiﬁcantly improved the tracking performance.
