AMALGAMATION OF INDIRECT GAMIFICATION INTO DEVELOPMENT AND 
OPERATIONS (DEVOPS) COURSE TEACHING  

Abstract.  The  work  investigates  the  effect  of  indirect  Gamification  in  Development  and 
Operations  (DevOps)  Course  teaching.  The  software  development  team  consisting  of  multiple 
contributors  coordinates  in  the  collaborative  work  environment  to  achieve  specific  predefined 
goals in a regulated and controlled fashion. In DevOps Course, the Installation and configuration 
of  the  various  software  tools  are  useful  in  the  context  of  application  development.  To  teach 
DevOps  Tools  precisely  to  achieve  the  learning  outcome  is  a  skilled task  for a trainer.  From the 
perspective  of  the  learner,  the  learning  environment  has  to  be  encouraging  and  exciting. 
Pedagogical techniques and ICT tools play an essential role during the knowledge transfer process. 
The motivation and reward to the Student are essential in achieving the learning outcomes of the 
Course.  The  author  used  the  third-party  Competition  as  an  indirect  Gamification  technique  to 
achieve the learning outcomes of the Course. The author encouraged the students to participate in 
the  Hacktoberfest  Competition  to  use  the  practical  skills  learned  in  the  Course.  The  Under 
Graduate  (UG)  and  Post  Graduate  (PG)  Students  have  gone  through  the  regular  sessions  of 
DevOps.  For  the  participation  purpose,  both  groups  of  students  communicated  on  one  platform. 
The students who succeeded faster during the GitHub Pull Request (PR) submission shared their 
experiences with other participants. The PG students participated 68.75% higher than UG students. 
Minimum of four PR submissions on GitHub and acceptance by the repository maintainer are the 
task  completion  criteria.  The  active  participation  of  the  small  number  of  UG  students  became  a 
motivational  factor  for  the  PG  students. The  Gaussian  distribution  on  the marks  obtained  by  the 
experimental  group  shows  the  absence  of  outliers.  The  research  shows  that  the  effectiveness  of 
indirect Gamification depends on the age group, level, course content, and learning environment. 
The  participation  of  a  faculty  member  in  the Competition  during  the learning activity  boosts  the 
desire  of  the  Student  to  complete  the  task.  The  experimental  group  of  15  Students  has 
outperformed in terms of the marks obtained compared to the control group of 52 students. 

Keywords: Indirect Gamification; DevOps Teaching; Jenkins; Github; Maven. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Gamification  is  an  activity  of  adding  game  mechanisms  into  services  or  products  to 
motivate or engage the users for positive outcomes. Gamification improves the natural desires 
of the participants. Gamification has effectively established significance in various fields such 
as  Human  resources,  Finance,  Banking,  Marketing,  E-Commerce,  Healthcare,  Personal 
Growth,  Societal  Improvement,  and  Pedagogy.  The  critical  game  mechanics  give  badges, 
challenges, leader boards, points, levels, and rewards to encourage participation. This work is 
specific to applying the indirect Gamification in the highly technical Computer Science (CS) 
and Information Technology (IT) course on DevOps.  

The DevOps, Agile Software Engineering Methods, Tools, and Techniques are essential 
skills for Software Developers, and IT teams working in the Operations domain. The DevOps 
tools Git, GitHub, Maven, TestNG, Eclipse, and Jenkins help automate Software Engineering 
processes.  The  students  are  actively  engaged  in  the  DevOps  Course  with  theory  concepts, 
demonstrations,  and  hands-on  practice.  The  teaching  of  the  CS  and  IT  courses  during  the 
COVID-19  lockdown  is  carried  out  using  online  meeting  tools  and  supporting  technologies 
like  Stream  to  store  the  video  lectures  in  the  Cloud.The  teaching  and  learning  during  the

immobility was a didactic experience for students and faculty members. The data availability 
upto 1.5 GB to 2 GB was essential, and conducting all sessions listed in the timetable was a 
hectic task for teachers and students.  

The problem statement. The learning outcomes of the highly technical courses taught 

in UG and PG Programs should be achieved effectively.  

The  current  pedagogy  frequently  results  in  an  uninteresting  classroom  environment  in 
the case of highly technical courses where various software has to be learned. If the problem 
is ignored, the Student may miss the targeted learning outcomes. The quality of teaching may 
suffer, as a result. 

Finding  the  combined  effect  of  motivation,  reward,  and  Indirect  Gamification  in  the 
teaching and learning of technical courses like DevOps is investigated in this work. The effect 
of  amalgamation  of  the  Indirect  Gamification  into  teaching  and  learning  by  introducing  the 
Hacktoberfest  competition  is  the  primary  intention  of  this  research  work.  This  proposed 
research  aspires  to  explore  the  option  of  Indirect  Gamification  in  pedagogy.  The  faculty 
trainer  does  the  encouragement,  motivation,  and  monitoring  during  the  course  tenure.  The 
marks  obtained  by  the  experimental  group  and  control  group  are  used  to  interpret  the 
effectiveness of the technique applied in the pedagogy.  

Hypothesis.  The  use  of  Indirect  Gamification  in  the  pedagogy  of  highly  technical 

DevOps courses in CS and IT improves the academic performance of the Student. 

Analysis  of  recent  studies  and  publications.  Gamification  is  used  as  a  technique  by 
the  Trainers  and  Researchers  at  different  levels  of  teaching  in  CS  and  IT  courses.  An 
extensive review on the use of Gamification in Science education and education management 
is available. Kalogiannakiset al.[1] carried out a the review of 177 papers on the Gamification 
used  in  Science  Education.  Da-Silvaet  al.[2]  have  done  a  literature  review  of  241  papers on 
education  management.  Dichev  and  Dicheva  [3]  have  done  a  critical  review  of  88  papers 
regarding the status of Gamification in education. Trinidad et al. [4] have done a bibliometric 
study to describe the scientific and structured evolution of Gamification. 

The researchers have tried Gamification during the teaching of the  CS and IT Courses, 
such  as  teaching  C-Language  programming,  Artificial  Intelligence,  and  Cyber  Security 
courses.  Ibáñez  et  al.[5]  found  the  moderate  positive  impact  of  using  the  Gamification  in 
learning of the C-Programming Language. Chubarkovaet al.[6] have tried Gamification in AI 
Education.  Roset  al.[7] tried  the  Non-compulsory  Gamification  for  the  effective  teaching  of 
the  Cyber  Security  course.  Oktaviati[8]  found  that  implementing  gamification  elements  in 
learning can motivate and engage the Student learning CS. 

The effect of the Gamification and its relation with the Gender, age groups, and levels is 
reported. Khan et al.[9] reported Digital Game-Based Learning and Gamification in teaching 
and  learning.  The  results  show  that  the  Game-Based  Learning  application  did  not  equally 
work for all students. The girls outperformed boys in engagement and learning outcomes. The 
study  gives  insights  into  the  development  of  better  educational  games  to  promote  student 
learning.  Connolly  et  al.[10]  reported  the  results  of  a  systematic  literature  review  on  the 
impact  of  gamified  activities  on  young  learners.  Lam  et  al.[11]  conducted  an  experiment 
involving four secondary students to check the effectiveness of the digital game. After seven 
weeks  of  observation,  it  was  found  that  digital  games  improve  the  online  contribution  and 
writing performance of the Student. The experiment was done based on the blended learning 
and gamification approach. The significant improvement results are found in the writing skills 
for  the  population  size  of  30.  Hasanet  al.[12]  use  online  discussion  environment  of  the 
Gamification  and  Moodle  Learning  Management  System  (LMS)  during  the  term  paper 
evaluation of the PG students. 

Darejeh[13]  used  Gamification  in  online  education.  Hasanet  al.[14]  discussed  that  in  the 
collaborative work environment, feedback and Gamification are essential. Auvinen et al.[15] tried

giving  achievement  badges  as  a  form  of  Gamification  to  reward  and  encourage  the  students. 
Cuevas-Martínez et al.[16] conducted a gamification experiment over four years in Spain. The use 
of  Gamification  during  the  student  assessment  and  video  games  like  Super  Mario  positively 
affects  the  students'  dropout  ratio.  García-Iruela  et  al.[17]  used  Gamification  for  creating  the 
research interest among the students. Pacheco-Velazquez[18] developed the challenging game as 
a pedagogical  design. The experiment shows that the game design  in the  logistic area promotes 
the  Student's  self-directed  learning  skills.  Romero-Rodríguez  et  al.[19]  used  Gamification 
strategies to achieve better effects from Massive Open Online Course usage in teaching.  

Adrian  et  al.[20]  developed  an  esthetically  pleasing  user  interface  of  the  gamification 
tool at the US Air Force Academy. According to [21],[22] the learning outcomes and student 
satisfaction  play  an  essential  role  in  teaching  the  challenging  Course  in  Computer  Science. 
The simplified user interface, the Client-Server suite, and dubbed Live Classroom simplified 
the  everyday  tasks  performed  by  students  and  teachers.  Villagrasa[23]  has  worked  on  the 
students'  collaborative  work,  virtual  teacher  environments,  and  visualization  3D  on  the 
webGL  for  effective  teaching.  Vranešićet  al.[24]  &  Varannaiet  al.  [25]  used  the  Kahoot 
system  for  the  UG  programs  in  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  and 
awarded extra marks to the students based on their performance.  

The investigation of the literature shows that the effect of third-party Competition in the 
course learning outcomes  is  not reported. The Trainer has  brought the UG & PG students to 
one  platform  and  used  the  participation  of  the  UG  student  as  the  influencing  factor  to 
encourage  the  PG  students.  The  kind  of  research  work  is  not  reported  either.  The  proposed 
research  of  amalgamation  of  the  Indirect  Gamification  into  the  DevOps  Teaching  unique 
work adds new knowledge to the existing pedagogy.  

The  Research  Goal.  This  work  aims  to  investigate  learning  outcomes  as  an  effect  of 
amalgamation of the indirect Gamification through the third party competition in the DevOps 
Concept course at the UG and PG level. 

2. THE THEORETICAL BACKGROUNDS 

Effective  knowledge  transfer  techniques  are  seldom  found  in  the  CS  and  IT  teaching 
and  learning processes. There  is a general assumption that  Students and the Faculty of these 
fields  are  more  aware  of  software  tools,  hence  they  use  suitable  tools  and  techniques 
effectively.  However,  the  learning  abilities  of  different  students  are  not  similar.  Therefore, 
well-tested techniques and methodologies are required to be employed. Technically, students 
and faculty trainers working in this field expect some other methodologies to learn and teach 
the  content  of  the  courses  in  a  better  manner.  In  addition  to  the  traditional  pedagogical 
methodologies, Gamification can help both students and teachers. 

The hype cycle, such as one by Gartner, gives intuition of the recent trending technological 
advancement  topics  in  the  product  and  service  industry.  The  inclusion  of  these  topics  in  the 
curriculum is the right step to develop the human resource, as per the industry's requirement. The 
Job  Description  and  Interaction  with  the  IT  Industry  Leaders  are  the  source  of  information  to 
understand  the  skill  required  in  the  software  Industry.  These  three  sources  and  market  research 
help  in  the  Curriculum  design  of  the  UG  and  PG  Programs.  The  course  content  of  DevOps 
Concepts  is  designed  by  considering  these  requirements  of  the  IT  industry.Considering  this 
scenario, tools such as Git, GitHub, Maven, TestNG, Eclipse and Jenkins are part of the DevOps 
Concepts Curriculum. The inclusion of the DevOps tools as a part of regular teaching in the CS 
and IT courses will help the students while working in the IT industry when they join as freshers. 
The  Course  is  a  part  of  the  UG  and  PG  curriculum  to  boost  confidence  among  the  students. 
Because the contribution in terms of the PR submissions on the version controlling system is also

related to the performance of the employee, it is one of the mechanisms in the IT industry to count 
the contribution by the Software Developer.  

The  DevOps  Concepts  is  an  advanced  level  Course  that  needs  knowledge  of  the 
Programming  language,  Open  Source  Software,  and  Software  Testing  Methodologies. 
Moreover,  it  requires  the  skills  to  integrate  all  the  tools  used  in  the  Agile  and  Traditional 
Software  Development  Methodologies  in  Continuous  Integration  (CI)  and  Continuous 
Development (CD) fashion. The Course is designed as the two credits for the theory and one 
credit for Laboratory work. The faculty trainer covered the theoretical concepts in two hours 
of  teaching.  The  faculty  trainer  also  engaged  the  students  for  the  two  hours  of  practical 
demonstrations and monitoring hands-on practice. The Course is taught to the PG students of 
Master  of  Computer  Applications  (MCA)  and  UG  Students  of  Bachelor  of  Computer 
Applications (BCA). The DevOps course is  in the first semester of the two-year PG program 
and  in  the  third  semester of  the  three-year  UG  program.  All  the  UG  and  PG  students  had  a 
specialty in Computer Science and IT. 

The knowledge of Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs) is the foundation block 
for  Software  Engineering.  The  practice  of  using  SDLCs  is  a  traditional  method  used  in  the 
Software  Industry.  Overtime,  the  processes  evolved,  and  agile  methodologies  are  a  regular 
practice  in  the  software  industry.  After  discussions  with  the  industry  leaders  and  the 
practitioners, it is found that "Scrum" is the important technique followed. 

The  job  roles  such  as  Product  Owner  and  Scrum  Master  are  essential  skills  for  the  IT 
Team. The recent developments in the field of DevOps and the integrations of the automation 
tools  are  used  at  the  various  stages  of  product  development.  The  Product  Owner  and  the 
Scrum  Master  drive  the  Development  Teams  by  floating  the  Functional  and  non-functional 
requirements.  

3. RESEARCH METHODS 

The online conduction of the DevOps Concept course happened between18 August 2020, 
and 24 December 2020. The Hacktoberfest 2020 competition came precisely in the middle of the 
course tenure. The author has carried out the research work at the Information Technology School 
of the University where the author is currently working. The end-of-semester examinations were 
conducted in January 2021. The DevOps Course is a part of the UG and PG programs at the IT 
school of the University. The effectiveness of a technique is measured in terms of the successful 
participation  and  completion  of  the  task  by  the  Student.  Moreover,  the  outcome  was  also 
measured  in  terms  of  the  marks  obtained  by  the  Student  during  the  continuous  evaluation  and 
final results declared after the end-of-semester examination. 

For  the  experimental  purpose,  the  students  of  the  BCA-UG  and  MCA-PG  programs 
were selected. Initially, the encouragement to participate in the Competition  was given to all 
the students of UG and PG. However, more participation was observed from the PG Students 
compared  to  UG  students.  The  sample  was  divided  into the  experimental  group  and  control 
group, as shown in table 1.

the  Competition.  The  students  who  did  not  participate  in  the  Competition  were  in  the  control 
group. There were 48 students from UG and four students from PG in the control group.  

Figure 1. Hacktoberfest Participant Count Details 

Figure 2 shows that out of the total participating PG students, there were 5 girls (38%), and 
8  boys  (62%).  Participation  is  not  simply  a  skill  to  work  in  the  collaboration  –  it  also  polished 
knowledge of the students' programming language and involved quality program writing practice.

3.1 Teaching-Learning process of the DevOps Course  

The  Trainer  of  the  DevOps  course  requires  the  prerequisite  knowledge  of  the  Open 
Source  projects  working  under  different  Licensing  policies.  Faculty  trainers  need  to  have 
prerequisites  of  Software  Engineering  and  Software  Project  Management.  Eventually,  the 
Trainer  can  cover  the  topics  on  CI/CD  Tools  and  Techniques.  The  Course  starts  with  the 
basics;  however,  the  practical  work  also  goes  hand-in-hand.  The  Installation  of  the  various 
Open  Source  DevOps  Tools  is  an  essential  skill.  The  successful  Installation  of  these  tools 
requires troubleshooting skills by looking into the online postings.  

3.2 Important DevOps Tools  

There  are  several  open-source  and  proprietary  software  tools  available  for  version 
control.  However,  Git  and  Github  are  more  popular  among  the  programming  community. 
There  are  two  approaches  to  use  Git  and  GitHub,  namely,  using,  from  GitHub  side  or  start 
using  from  the  Git  Tool  installed  on  the  computer  of  the  user.  Github  is  the  Distributed  as 

128 

 
 
 
 
 
DOI: 10.33407/itlt.v87i1.4619                ISSN: 2076-8184. Information Technologies and Learning Tools, 2022, Vol 87, №1. 

well  as  central  repository  for  the  collaborative  project  work.  The  critical  learning  outcomes 
for  Git  and  Github  are  Push,  Pull,  forking,  cloning,  creating  log  records,  merging,  and 
branching operations.  

Maven is the build and project management tool most suitable for Java developers. The 
dependencies on the third-party Java Archives files can be quickly resolved by installing the 
Maven. Maven can be configured as Project Object Model and integrated with the Integrated 
Development  Environment  tools  like  Eclipse.  The  TestNG  testing  methodologies,  parallel 
execution of the testing threads, and annotations are part of the Course. The configuration of 
the  Java  projects  for the  Local,  Central,  Remote  repository,  build  the  project,  deploy  as  per 
the  target  are  the  critical  learning  outcomes  for  Maven  Learning.  The  TestNG  is  the  tool 
installed in the Eclipse with the Maven projects.  

Jenkins  is  the  automation  tool  used  for  the  configuration  of  the  various  Jobs  to  be 
triggered as the result of the  updates  in the development events, such as remotely  executing 
the Job, Windows batch file execution, execution of the jobs after the specified time interval, 
executing the Job after a particular Job, triggering the build after linked updates found on the 
GitHub,  and  Sending  the  notification  as  an  email.  These  CI/CD  integration  methods  of  the 
automation  pipeline  are  essential  for  the  smooth  delivery  of  the  updates  in  software 
development. 

3.3 ICT Tools used in teaching  

The  ICT  Tools  such  as  MS-Teams,  LMS,  Powerpoint  presentations  are  helpful  for 
teaching. Whatsapp  is used  for coordination and communication among students and faculty 
members.  The  assignments  are  submitted  on  the  LMS  developed  in-house.  The  deadlines-
based assignments are evaluated on Moodle LMS, as shown in figure 3. 

Figure 3. Assignment Submission records on LMS for DevOps Course 

3.4 Indirect Gamification 

The author used Indirect Gamification by  introducing Hacktoberfest 2020 Competition 
as a part of the learning outcome of the Course. The direct reward points are not offered to the

learner,  but  the  prizes  offered  by  the  competition  organizers  helped  to  provide  the  rewards. 
The  outcomes  are  measured  in  terms  of  successful  PR  submission  to  GitHub.  The  Course 
learning outcomes are made more attractive to develop the skills among the students, such as 
Git and Github tools for the version controlling. Peer learning has worked significantly when 
few students lag in reaching the target of four PR submissions. The requirement of the quality 
PR  submission  is  fulfilled  by  creating  the  programming  code  and  unit  testing  by  the 
contributor. 

The  Direct  rewards  are  given  by  the  organizers  of  the  Hacktoberfest,  such  as  T-shirts 
and Stickers from the sponsors. After few months, the postal packets of the prizes come as the 
home delivery. The activity of the PR submission process continues in October. The website 
of the Hacktoberfest shows the progress and maturity of the PR submission after the specified 
time interval.  

3.5 About Hacktoberfest Competition 

DigitalOcean  launches  Hacktoberfest  competition.  Participants  in  the  Hacktoberfest 
represented  151  countries  having  thousands  of  unique  skill  sets.  The  Hacktoberfest 
competition  is  regarding  the  awareness  among  the  software  development  community  to  use 
the version controlling system  in the teamwork. The collaborative work in the team requires 
the central and distributed repository in the organization, such as Github.  The participant has 
to send the four PRs in October in any time zone. The PR can be to any public repository on 
GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The PR must contain commits made by the participant. 
If a maintainer of the repository does not report PR as spam, it is counted toward participation 
in Hacktoberfest.The quality of the code contributed by the participant has to be  maintained 
by writing a neat and clean code. 

In  this  case,  the  participant  students  and  faculty  members  of  the  DevOps  Course 
contributed  to  the  Open-Source  GitHub  Public  repositories  by  writing  the  programs  in 
Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Therefore, the PR contribution,  merging, and acceptance 
by  the  maintainers  of  the  public  repositories  are  the  minimum  requirement.  However,  the 
enthusiastic participants who are part of the population of this research work have contributed 
more than sufficient requirements of the PR submission.  

3.6 Faculty Involvement at Every Stage 

The  indirect  Gamification  in  teaching  requires  the  faculty  involvement  to  monitor 
progress  and  solutions  provided  by  the  students.  Giving  the  proper  direction,  rectifying  the 
errors  made  by  the  students  is  handled  by  the  Trainer.  The  students  also  learn  from  other 
students  in  the  batch.  Few  students  can  understand  the  open-source  tools  very  quickly.  The 
understanding  of  such  a  student  assists  other  students  in  the  class.  Accompanying  such  a 
student with some student who is facing difficulty can help in a positive direction.The Faculty 
has an essential role  in seeing whether the students are synchronized with other participants. 
The  faculty  trainer's  role  is  to  take  the  feedback  from  all  such  parties  involved  in  the 
communication.  

Whatsapp communication chat between the students and Faculty  is shown  in  figure 4. 
The  figure  shows  the  feedback  and  progress  monitoring  of  the  participant  students.  Few 
students have faced technical difficulty during the completion of the task. The active students 
and Faculty have helped them to resolve the issues. A participant’s selecting the wrong labels 
may lead to disappointment, and the repository owner may not accept the PR. The selection of 
the  active  repository  on  Github  is  an  essential  criterion.  If  a  participant  selects  the  wrong 
repository, such as the maintainer is not looking into the PRs submitted by the participants for 

130 

 
DOI: 10.33407/itlt.v87i1.4619                ISSN: 2076-8184. Information Technologies and Learning Tools, 2022, Vol 87, №1. 

the longer duration, then all efforts go to waste. If the maintainer takes a longer time, then the 
competition duration finishes, and the participant experiences disappointment. 

Figure 4. Whatsapp chats with PG students for Hacktobefest Competition 

Here Faculty trainer participated along with the students to encourage and  maintain the 
rhythm  towards  completing  the task.  Furthermore, the  Faculty  maintained  the  quality  of  the 
PRs by uploading the Java  solution programs  for the Graph Coloring  of the Bipartite Graph 
Theorem, graph degree calculation using Handshaking Lemma, Direc's Theorem for detecting 
the  Hamiltonian  Circuit  in  a  simple  graph,  a  necessary  condition  for  Eulerian  Graph,  and 
checking if the graph is Semi-Eulerian or not.The Faculty shared these contributions with all 
the participant students to make them aware that the Trainer chose high-quality Graph Theory 
and Combinatorial topics to participate in the Competition. Figure 5 shows the faculty trainer 
progress screen of the Hacktoberfest Competition.

3.7 Motivation to the students  

The motivation from the faculty trainer is an essential factor in maintaining the rhythm 
with  the  students.  The  trainer  faculty  used  the  words  like  "Well-Done,"  "Great  Work," 
"Congratulations,"  "Good  Work,"  "Keep  Doing  Good"  to  appreciate  the  students.  The 
appreciation for the excellent work used in personal communication with the learner creates a 
rapport with the Student. Nowadays, faculty trainers may use Whatsapp, telegram, or similar 
tools  for  communication  with  the  students.  In  addition,  small  images  like  "Claps"  can  be 
helpful to congratulate students on their achievement. Figure 6 shows the motivation provided 
by the faculty trainer during the Competition. 

The most important part of the motivation is to announce the success of our students at 
the higher  level of the organization. In addition,  sharing the  information of  the achievement 
with participating and non-participating students can build a competitive environment.

4. THE RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The outcomes of the Course can be considered as tangible and intangible. The tangible 
outcomes  are  counted  here  as  the  Marks  obtained  and  Prizes  received  by  the  UG  and  PG 
students.  The  effect  of  the  motivation  used  by  the  Faculty  is  not  calculated;  however,  the 
positive effects are observed  by the  Faculty. The  intangible outcomes are  important because 
they  are  related  to  the  skill-based  final  placements  of  the  students.  Another  outcome  of  the 
DevOps subject is excitement among the students to use the tools in post-course finishing and 
completing the end-of-semester examination. Thus, the experimental group well received the 
intangible and intangible outcomes.

a) Marks Obtained as an Outcome 
The  course  examination  evaluations  are  divided  into  continuous  and  end-of-semester 
examinations. A maximum of 30 marks is assigned for the continuous evaluations, whereas a 
maximum  of  70  marks  is  assigned  for  the  end-of-semester  examinations.  The  continuous 
evaluation  methodology  used  here  is  the  multiple  internal  handwritten  assignments,  Final 
Journal  Compilation  of  the  practical  work  performed,  end-of-semester  examination  for  the 
practical work. The First outcome that we consider is  in terms of the  marks obtained by the 
students  in  continuous  evaluations,  end  semester  examinations,  and  overall.  The  Box  and 
Whisker of the marks obtained by the experimental group out of 100 found that the median is 
at 81, and the third quartile is at 93, as shown in figure 8. The minimum marks are found at 
72. As there is no outlier found on the lower tail and the upper tail, normally distributed  data 
is found in the marks obtained.

Figure 8. Experimental Group marks out of 100in DevOps Course 

The  Box-Whisker  plot  in  Figure  7  &  Figure  8  shows  that  the  experimental  group  has 
more marks than the control group. Each quartile of the experimental group has more marks 
in  overall  performance.  The  distribution  of  the  marks  for the  experimental  group  is  skewed 
towards the right side. This indicates that the students who participated in the Competition are 
having more marks than the students who did not participate in the Competition.

Figure 10. Experimental Group marks out of 30 (Continuous Evaluation) in DevOps Course 

The Box-Whisker plot in Figure 9 & Figure 10 shows that the experimental group has 
more  marks  than  the  control  group  in  continuous  evaluation  in  each  of  the  quartiles  of  the 
experimental  group.  The  distribution  of  the  marks  for the  experimental  group  in  continuous 
evaluations is skewed towards the right side. This indicates that the students who participated 
in  the  Competition  have  more  marks  in  continuous  evaluations  than  those  who  did  not 
participate in the Competition.

Figure 12. Experimental Group marks out of 70 (End-of-Semester Examination) in DevOps 
Course 

The Box-Whisker plot in Figure 11 & Figure 12 shows that the experimental group has 
more  marks  than  the  control  group  in  end-of-semester  examinations  in  each  quartile  of  the 
experimental  group.  The  distribution  of  the  marks  out  of  70  for  the  experimental  group  is 
skewed  towards the  right  side.  The  students  who participated  in  the  Competition  have  more 
marks  in  end-of-semester evaluations than those who did not participate in the Competition. 
The  examination  department  masks  the  answer  sheets  of  the  end-of-semester  examination 
before evaluations by the examiner. Hence there is no possibility of bias.  

Following  the  Normal  distribution  rules,  the  Marks  obtained  by  the  Student  less  than 
Q1-1.5*IQR  and  marks  obtained  greater  than  Q3+1.5*IQR  are  the  outliers.  Therefore,  the 
outliers are missing in the given data set. The A/B Test shows that the hypothesis is proven as 
the experimental group has secured more marks and won the prizes.

b)  PR Submission and Prizes 
As shown in figure 13, there are 64 PRs as the sum of a minimum 4 PRs contribution, 
and an additional 26 PRs show that the PG students have actively participated in the activity. 
Each PR submission consists of related activities, such as writing a program  for  the specific 
functional  requirement  in  the  specific  programming  language  and  submission  using  Git  and 
GitHub to the repository. For example, one PR submission requires the knowledge of the Git 
Commands and the Github usage skills.

The reward-based encouragement, participatory teaching, and motivation to the students 
are vital factors. In the current IT industry scenario, DevOps has many tools to be covered in 
the  curriculum.  The  organizers  of  the  competition  award  the  prizes  in  the  form  of  T-Shirts. 
All the 16 participants of Hacktoberfest,  including the 13 PG students, 02 UG students, and 
one faculty member, won the Prizes. 

The sample was not explicitly divided into the two groups. However, after the students’ 
participation in the Competition, the experimental and control groups were naturally created. 
There were no explicit marks assigned for participation in the Competition. Interestingly, it is 
observed  that  the  experimental  group  who  participated  in  the  Competition  has  performed 
significantly  better than the control group.  Using the concept of Normal Distribution, μ ± 2ς 
has  not  shown  any  outlier  in  the  marks  obtained  by  the  experimental  group.  Here  the  μ  is 
mean,  and  ς  is  the  Standard  Deviation.  The  outlier  is  also  missing  when  tested  using  the 
Q1±1.5*IQR.  Here  the  Q1  is  the  First  Quartile,  and  IQR  is  the  Inter  Quartile  Range.  The 
tangible benefits in terms of outcomes of the research activity were visible. The experimental 
group has performed better in terms of the marks obtained compared to the control group.  

The research shows that 81.25 % of the PG and 12.5 % of UG students' participated in 
the indirect Gamification. The overall PG participation is 76.47% of the entire PG class. The 
UG participation  is 4% of the entire UG class. The students have experienced peer  learning. 
The  indirect  Gamification  has  worked  well  for  effective  learning  outcomes  of  the  highly 
technical  DevOps  Course.  The  intangible  outcomes  were  also  equally  observed  as  the 
concepts  learned  by  the  participants  were  practically  used  in  the  Git  and  Github  tools. 
Students have clearly understood how to contribute to the repositories maintained by the other 
owners.  Moreover,  students  have  also  learned  that  they  can  maintain  repositories,  and  after 
tagging, they can participate in the Competition.  

The  involvement  of  the  two  UG  students  has  played  an  important  role.  When  UG 
students perform well in the PR submission, it creates performance excitement among the PG 
students. On the other side, the motivation by the Faculty through the online class conduction, 
Whatsapp  communication,  and  telephonic  communication  encouraged  the  students.  The 
contribution of each factor is unmeasured; however, the outcomes are visible in terms of the 
performance grading obtained by the students.  

In  future  work,  the  effect  of  learning  abilities,  age  group,  learning  motivation  factors 
will  be  investigated. The LMS Moodle  is already  in use, which  has direct Gamification  like 
providing batches, grades, and stars to the participant students.

Анотація.  У  роботі  досліджується  вплив  непрямої  гейміфікації  на  навчання  курсу 
«Розробка та експлуатація» (DevOps). Команда розробників програмного забезпечення, що 
складається  з  кількох  учасників,  координує  свої  дії  в  спільному  робочому  середовищі  для 
досягнення  конкретних  заздалегідь  визначених  цілей  шляхом  регуляції  та  контролю.  У 
інструментів 
курсі  DevOps  встановлення 
використовуються  в  контексті  розробки  програм.  Завдання  тренера  –  навчити 
використовувати  інструменти  DevOps  для  досягнення  поставлених  навчальних  цілей. 
Створене  освітнє  середовище  повинно  мотивувати  учнів  до  навчання.  Педагогічні  методи 
та ІКТ відіграють важливу роль у процесі передачі знань. Для досягнення поставленої мети 
навчання  необхідна  мотивація  та  підтримка  студента  під  час  проходження  курсу.  Автор 
використав  незалежний  конкурс  як  технологію  непрямої  гейміфікації  з  метою  досягнення 
результатів  навчального  курсу.  Студентам  було  запропоновано  взяти  участь  у  конкурсі 
Hacktoberfest  з  метою  використання  своїх  практичних  навичок,  отриманих  під  час 
проходження курсу. Студенти бакалаврату (UG – Under Graduate) та аспірантури (PG – Post 
Graduate)  пройшли  регулярні  сесії  DevOps.  Обидві  групи  студентів  спілкувались  на  одній 
платформі.  Студенти,  які  швидше  внесли  дані  PR  до  GitHub,  поділилися  своїм  досвідом  з 
іншими  учасниками.  Кількість  студентів  PG  (68,75%)  значно  перевищила  учасників-
студентів  UG.  Основним  критерієм  виконання  поставленого  завдання  було  мінімум 
чотириразове  внесення  даних  PR  у  GitHub  та  збереження  їх  у  репозитарії.  Активна  участь 
невеликої кількості студентів UG стала мотиваційним фактором для студентів PG. Розподіл 
Гауса  за  оцінками,  отриманими  експериментальною  групою,  показує  відсутність  викидів. 
Дослідження  показує,  що  ефективність  непрямої  гейміфікації  залежить  від  вікової  групи, 
рівня, змісту курсу та середовища навчання. Участь викладача в конкурсі під час навчальної 
діяльності  підвищує  бажання  студента  виконати  завдання.  Експериментальна  група  з  15 
студентів перевершила за отриманими оцінками контрольну групу з 52 студентів.
