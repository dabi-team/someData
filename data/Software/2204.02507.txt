Abstract—Electric power infrastructure has ignited several
of the most destructive wildﬁres in recent history. Preemptive
power shut-offs are an effective tool to mitigate the risk of
ignitions from power lines, but at the same time can cause
widespread power outages. Electric utilities are thus faced with
the challenging trade-off of where and when to implement these
shut-offs, as well as how to most efﬁciently restore power once
the wildﬁre risk is reduced. This work proposes a mathematical
optimization problem to help utilities make these decisions. Our
model co-optimizes the power shut-off (considering both wildﬁre
risk reduction and power outages) as well as the post-event
restoration efforts related to inspection and energization of lines.
It is implemented as a rolling horizon optimization problem that
is resolved whenever new forecasts of load and wildﬁre risk
become available. We demonstrate our method on the IEEE RTS-
GMLC test case using real wildﬁre risk data and forecasts from
US Geological Survey, and investigate the sensitivity of the results
to the forecast quality, decision horizon and system restoration
budget. The software implementation is available in the open
source software package PowerModelsWildﬁre.jl.

I. INTRODUCTION

Wildﬁre ignitions caused by electrical equipment are an
increasing concern for power grid operators. A study of Aus-
tralia’s bushﬁres found that electrical infrastructure accounts
for 30% of ignitions during droughts and heat-waves [1]. In
California, the state ﬁreﬁghting organization’s annual wildﬁre
activity report Redbook reports that between 2015-2020, the
10% of wildﬁres that were ignited by electrical equipment
were responsible for more than 70% of damages ($17.5
billion) [2].

Research on interactions between wildﬁres and the electric
grid after a ﬁre has been ignited include derating of power
line capacity near a progressing wildﬁre [3], [4], operations
when wildﬁre approach electric systems, [5]–[7], and fast
simulations of wildﬁre spread to provide early warnings for
transmission line shutdowns [8]. However,
the focus has
recently shifted towards how to reduce the risk of wildﬁre
ignitions. Refs. [9]–[12] review approaches to reduce the risk
of ignitions, and adaptations of this kind are already being
planned by utilities. For example, Paciﬁc Gas & Electric
(PG&E) announced an initiative to underground 10,000 miles
of distribution lines over the course of more than a decade at
a cost of $20 billion [13], along with other measures such as

more frequent vegetation clearing within the right of way of
power lines. Unfortunately, the signiﬁcant cost and need for
qualiﬁed crews and equipment means that these risk reduction
approaches take time to implement.

Meanwhile, power system operators rely on short-term
measures to reduce risk, including changes to the protection
system settings (i.e. disabling of automatic reclosing) [3] or
Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), which de-energize grid
equipment during high wildﬁre risk events. While highly ef-
fective in reducing wildﬁre risk [14], PSPS leads to intentional
disconnection of customers, causing large scale power outages
that may last for days [15]. Since the economic and health
impacts of power outages can be signiﬁcant, it is important to
balance the beneﬁts of wildﬁre risk reduction with the impacts
of power outages. To this end, [16] proposed a framework to
optimally balance wildﬁre risk reduction and power outage
sizes when deciding which lines to shut off. Other approaches
include data-driven methods to plan PSPS by training machine
learning models with optimization problems results [17]–[19],
or using a dynamic programming approach to optimize a PSPS
[20]. These methods focus on accelerating the solution time
of a planned PSPS for improved use on large networks in
real time. Ref. [21] proposes an optimal investment model
that considers installation of batteries and under-grounding
power lines to mitigate and reduce the impact of PSPS and
[22] studies how microgrids can improve resilience against un-
planned outages due to events like wildﬁres. Further research
on PSPS include [23], which expands on time-varying risk and
operational factors such as energy storage for temporal load-
shifting, and [24], which considers the fairness of repeated
PSPS events for utility customers. Another related research
includes improved risk forecasting for electric grid wildﬁre
risk [19], [25].

Although the above methods may be effective in identifying
locations where the implementation of PSPS is required,
they do not explicitly consider how to effectively restore
the system once the wildﬁre risk is reduced. A main reason
for the prolonged outages following a PSPS event is that
utility crews must manually inspect the de-energized power
lines for damage that could cause ignitions before they can
be placed back into operation. Thus, while de-energization
of a line can happen instantaneously, the re-energization (or
restoration) can take hours or days [26]. To make optimal
decisions about which lines to de-energize, it is therefore
necessary to assess how de-energization impacts the risk of
wildﬁre ignitions and power outages both during the initial
shut-down and throughout the restoration process.

In this paper, we aim to address this gap by developing a
multi-period optimal power shut-off (MOPS) problem which

 
 
 
 
 
 
co-optimizes power line shut-offs and restoration for the power
grid in situations with high wildﬁre risk. The formulation com-
bines and extends our prior work on balancing wildﬁre risk and
power outages for a single time period [16] and post-disaster
restoration planning [27]. The objective function maximizes
the electric load served to customers, while minimizing total
wildﬁre risk, and accounting for utility capacity to perform
line inspections.

Since the optimal operational decisions depend on the
current and forecasted risk and must be updated as new
information becomes available (e.g. every day), we formulate
the problem as a rolling horizon optimization problem. The
problem is challenging to solve due to the presence of binary
variables representing the on/off status of the transmission
lines, as well as the large number of grid constraints across
multiple time periods [27]. In our case study, we therefore
investigate the impact of the decision horizon on the solution
quality. We also assess how forecast errors for the wildﬁre risk
and different restoration budgets impact the solution.

In summary, the contributions of this paper are 1) a rolling
horizon, multi-period optimization model which co-optimizes
public safety power shutoffs and the subsequent grid restora-
tion, 2) analysis of the sensitivity of the problem to several
parameters including the forecast errors, forecast horizon and
the restoration budget.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II introduces the problem formulation. Section III presents
the case study and problem setup, and analysis of the results.
Section IV concludes the work.

II. MODELING AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

In this section, we formulate the Multi-period Optimal
Power Shutoff (MOPS) problem. MOPS is a rolling horizon
optimization model that provides an optimized schedule for
both power line shut-offs and restoration. It combines and
extends the single-period optimal power shut-off model in [16]
and the grid restoration planning model in [27].

A. Rolling Horizon Formulation

We envision a grid operator of a power grid with a set
of buses B, lines L, generators G and loads D. This grid
has elevated wildﬁre risk, and the operator is considering a
public safety power shutoff to mitigate the wildﬁre threat. The
operator must make decisions on the power lines they may
shutdown, customers they may disconnect, and how to bring
the grid back online in the future. Their goal is to reduce
wildﬁre risk while minimizing customer power outages and
maintaining grid reliability.

Wildﬁre risk depends on ambient conditions such as veg-
etation cover, humidity and wind speed, and is updated on
a regular basis. For example,
the Wildland Fire Potential
Index (WFPI) [28] is released daily and provides both current
and 7-day forecasts for the contiguous United States. Due to
the evolving nature of these forecasts, it makes sense to (i)
take the forecasts into account when deciding on an optimal
schedule for public safety power shut-offs and restoration, and
(ii) update the schedule daily as new information becomes

available. We therefore formulate our problem as a rolling
horizon optimization problem with forecast horizon H, as
shown in Model 1 (and further explained below). For a
given day T , a Multi-period Optimal Power Shutoff (MOPS)
timesteps t ∈ T where
problem is solved including all
T = {T, ..., T + H}. The power shut-off and restoration
actions for the ﬁrst day t = T are then implemented on the
power grid. The next day, we repeat the optimization process
with T ← T + 1, given the current status of the grid and
updated forecast information. Below, we present the MOPS
model for an individual day.

B. Objective function

The system operator is pursuing three different objectives,
namely maximizing load, minimizing wildﬁre risk and main-
taining grid reliability. We ﬁrst describe how these three
objectives are evaluated.

1) Load served: The load DServed is calculated as
(cid:88)

(cid:88)

DServed =

xdtwdtP D
dt .

(1)

t∈T

d∈D

Here, P D
is a parameter expressing the total demand for
dt
electricity from load d at time period t and wdt is a weight
used to express increased priority for certain load (e.g. a
hospital may have a higher weight). We assume that load can
be continuously shed, with the continuous decision variable
xdt representing the percentage of load that is served. The
total demand served DServed is obtained by summing over all
loads d ∈ D and all time periods t ∈ T .

2) Wildﬁre risk: We express the total risk of wildﬁre
ignitions based on the wildﬁre risk associated with each
transmission line in the network, i.e.

RF ire =

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

t∈T

ij∈L

zijtRijt

(2)

Here, Rijt represents the risk of a wildﬁre ignition from line ij
at time t if the line is energized (we discuss how to obtain these
risk values in the case study). The binary decision variable zijt
represents the status of the line, with zijt = 1 indicating that
it is on and zijt = 0 indicating that it is off. By choosing to
de-energize the line, i.e. setting zijt = 0, we can thus reduce
the wildﬁre risk of line ij at time t to zero.

3) Grid Vulnerability: Because the grid beneﬁts from hav-
ing many transmission lines and multiple paths for power to
ﬂow along, we want to avoid disabling too many lines. In
particular, we would like to keep low risk lines in operation
even if they do not contribute to serving more load, because
removing too many lines from service reduces redundancy in
the transmission network. To characterize the effect of de-
energizing lines on system security, we deﬁne the system
vulnerability as

Vsystem =

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

t∈T

ij∈L

(1 − zijt)V

(3)

Here, V represents the vulnerability associated with turning
an individual line off and VSystem represents the total vulner-
ability of the network.

Next, we combine RF ire and VSystem in a single term,

Model 1 Multi-period Optimal Power Shutoff (MOPS)

RF ire − VSystem = |L||T |V +

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

t∈T

ij∈L

zijt(Rijt − V )

This expression highlights that V represents the minimum
wildﬁre risk for which it is beneﬁcial to disable a line, and we
will hence refer to V as the vulnerability threshold. Choosing
a non-zero value for V thus provides an incentive to keep low
risk lines, or lines that may be low risk in the future, energized
to increase redundancy.

We recognize that expressing grid vulnerability on a line-
by-line basis is less comprehensive and meaningful than using
other metrics such as N-1 security. However, it does allow us to
express a preference for keeping low risk lines in operation. A
more in-depth modeling and investigation of grid vulnerability
and operational security in the context of high wildﬁre risk is
left for future work.

Given the above modeling considerations, we formulate the
objective function (5a). Note that the objective function uses
the total load DT ot and the total wildﬁre risk RT ot before
a power shut-off as normalization factors, with DT ot, RT ot
deﬁned as

DT ot =

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

t∈T

d∈D

P D

dt , RT ot =

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

t∈T

ij∈L

Rijt

This normalization implies that the objective functions ex-
presses the percentage of load or wildﬁre risk after imple-
mentation of the PSPS, with 0 ≤ DServed/DT ot ≤ 1 and
0 ≤ RF ire/RT ot ≤ 1.

The trade-off parameter α ∈ [0, 1] allows us to express a
preference for either focusing on serving load or mitigating
wildﬁre risk. The preference for mitigating wildﬁre risk vs
limiting grid vulnerability is expressed by our choice of the
vulnerability threshold V .

C. Restoration Constraints

An important and novel aspect of our formulation is the
consideration of a limited restoration budget, i.e. a limited
capacity to inspect and restore power lines after a public safety
power shut-off. The limits on how many miles of lines can be
restored in each time period is described by constraints (5f)-
(5g). Constraints (5e) set the indicator variable for restoration
yL
ijt to 1 if a line is off in the previous period zL
ijt−1 = 0 and
on in the current period zL
ijt = 1. These logical constraints
are implemented in the optimization problem by (4), where
the three inequalites form the logical negation of zL

Constraint (5f) implements the same constraint for the initial

limits the amount of restoration that can occur in a single
period according to the budget available Yt. The cost of
restoring a line scales with length (cid:96)ij, because the primary
action in restoring a line is to inspect the line for damage

D. Power Flow Constraints

To model how de-energization and restoration of lines
impact the amount of electricity served to customers, it is
important to model the power ﬂows in the system. Equations
(5i)-(5n) uses a DC power ﬂow formulation to model the
power ﬂow in each time period, accounting for shedding load
and de-energized/restored lines.

tion P G

must sum to zero at each bus. The sets Gi, Li, Di represent
the sets of generators, lines and load demands at bus i. Eq.
(5j) ensures that the load shed proportion xD
dt is constrained
to be within 0 and 1. The constraint in (5k) constrains the
power P G
gt from each generator g to between 0 and its upper
power limit P G
gt . The upper limit may vary with the time
period t for renewable energy sources, based on the forecasted
maximum output. While this problem formulation can support
non-zero lower bounds on generation by including additional
binary variables for generator on/off status, we remove the unit
commitment aspect in this paper for simplicity.

the line is energized and zL
ijt = 1. When a line is de-energized,
zL
ijt = 0, the power ﬂow across the line is 0. Equations
(5m) and (5n) deﬁne the relationship between voltage angle
differences and line power ﬂow, while accounting for when
a line becomes disabled. When a line is energized, zL
ijt = 1,
these constraints reduce to ordinary linearized DC power ﬂow,

P L

ijt = −bij(θit − θjt),

(6)

where bij is the line suseptance, and θit and θjt are the bus
voltage angles for bus i and j at time t. When the line is
de-energized, zijt = 0, the power ﬂow is decoupled from the
ij and θ∆
voltage angle difference through the big-M values θ∆
ij ,
which can be calculated as in [29]. This allows the power ﬂow
to be constrained to 0 in (5l) without constraining the voltage
angle differences.

III. CASE STUDY

We next demonstrate the use of our proposed model and
study the sensitivity to the forecast horizon, forecast accuracy,
restoration budget and the vulnerability threshold of disabling
lines.

A. Case study setup

We ﬁrst describe our implementation and the data used to

set up our case study.

1) Implementation: The optimization model is available in
the open source package PowerModelsWildﬁre.jl [16], imple-
mented in the Julia language [30], and solved using the Gurobi
v9.1 optimization solver [31].

2) Test System: We base our case study on the RTS-
GMLC [32] system. This synthetic test system has geographic
coordinates located in southern California, a region which has
been affected by Public Safety Power Shut-Offs. The system
has one year of hourly load and renewable energy proﬁles,
and we choose to use data from the month of October. For
each day, we pick the hour with the highest load forecast.
To obtain a case with an interesting level of congestion, we
increased the active power demand using the API method in
[33], which proportionally increases each load in the system
until transmission line limits are constrained. This increased
the load and generation in the network by a factor of 2.14,
and lead to a higher utilization of the transmission network.
We use the a uniform load priority weight wdt = 1.

3) Wildﬁre risk data: Wildﬁre risk data was obtained from
the United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) Wildland Fire
Potential Index (WFPI) [28] which estimates the potential a
one-acre ﬁre will spread and burn more than 500-acres. This
measure incorporates fuel models and forecast information for
precipitation, dry bulb temperature and wind speeds to create
a daily forecast of the WFPI for up to 7 days. For each line
and each day, we calculate the wildﬁre risk as the highest
WFPI value along the line, in accordance with [34]. Using
the maximum risk implies that we focus on minimizing risk
at particularly risky locations.

(a) Power Line Risk

(b) Risk Forecasts

Fig. 1: System Wildﬁre Risk Data: 1a shows a histogram of the
wildﬁre risk of individual transmission lines, based on all realized
wildﬁre risk observed in the month of October. 1b shows the realized
(black) and forecasted (orange) wildﬁre risk for the overall system,
calculated as the sum of all wildﬁre risk values across all lines. Each
forecast is represented with a line that covers the next 7 days.

To provide an overview of the wildﬁre risk data, Figure
1a shows a histogram of all the realized wildﬁre risk values
(i.e. not including forecasted data) for all lines across all days
in the month of October. We observe that many lines have
either zero risk or risk in the range between 70-120. There is a
small number of lines that have very high risk > 160. Figure
1b shows the total system risk before any power shut-offs
(i.e., the sum of all wildﬁre risk values for all lines, assuming
all lines are energized) based on the forecasted (in red) and
realized (in black) wildﬁre risk values. We observe that there
are substantial forecast errors, with the forecast sometimes
underestimating and sometimes overestimating the risk.

4) Baseline Parameters: We set α = 0.7 as we found this
to provide a reasonable trade-off between load shed and risk,
based on previous work [16]. We further use the following
parameter selections, unless otherwise speciﬁed:

• Optimality Gap: 0.01%
• Solver Time Limit: 1 hour
• Restoration Budget: 75 miles/day
• Forecast Horizon: 4 days
• Vulnerability Threshold: 100 WFPI

B. Baseline Solution

We ﬁrst present the output of running this method in on the
RTS-GMLC system using the baseline parameter settings. The
MOPS problem is solved for each day, using information about
the current on/off status of the grid and the forecasted load
and wildﬁre risk. The output is a set of optimal shutoff and

3) Solution times: The baseline experiment involved solv-
ing the rolling horizon MOPS problem with a 4 day forecast
horizon for 21 days, and solved in 29 seconds. However, we
note that the solve time is highly dependent on the problem
parameters, in particular to the vulnerability threshold V and
α. In some instances it could take more than 12 hours to solve
the problem.

C. Sensitivity to Forecast Horizon

Next, we investigate the impact of the forecast horizon
on the solution. The USGS provides a seven day WFPI
risk forecast, and we solve the rolling horizon problem with
forecast horizons ranging from 1 to 7 days. We expect that
a longer horizon may improve the decision making, but also
increase the size of the optimization problem and associated
solve time. In our experiments, the solve time increases from
1.93s 1-day horizon to 28.67s for a 4-day horizon and to
213.63s for the 7-day horizon.

We ﬁrst assess the impact on the objective function. We
calculate the total load served with Eq. (1), total system risk
with (2) and system vulnerability with (3), using the realized
decisions and true wildﬁre risk for each time step and summing
the values across the entire decision horizon. Table I(a) show
the 3 elements of the objective function (after scaling by the
factor α) and the ﬁnal objective function value for forecast
horizons from 1 to 7 days. Figure 4 shows the percentage
of load served DServed/DT ot,
the percentage of wildﬁre
risk RF ire/RT ot and the normalized system vulnerability
VSystem/RT ot.

the total

We next consider

From Table I(a), we observe that the total objective function
value improves by approximately 4.2% as the forecast horizon
increases from 1 to 7 days, with the most signiﬁcant improve-
ments achieved within 3 days with a reduction of 3.2%. Figure
4 shows that the forecast horizon has a very small impact on
the total load served, but that for shorter horizons, the total
system risk is smaller, while the system vulnerability is higher.
line energization and de-
energization events that occur during the 21 day period, shown
in Table I(b). The forecast horizon has a major impact on the
number of de-energized lines. We observe 93 de-energizations
with a 1-day horizon, which is reduced to 74 de-energizations
when using a 7-day horizon. The number of line restorations is
more similar for the two problems, with 61 restorations when
using a 1-day horizon compared with 54 restorations when
using a 7-day horizon. The total miles of restored power lines
do not follow the same pattern. The two scenarios that restore
the fewest miles of lines are with a 1-day (1,316 miles) and
7-day horizon (1,307 miles). A 3-day horizon results in the
most miles of restored power lines, restoring 1,436 miles. The
total length of restored lines is likely impacted by the ability
to use as much of the daily restoration budget as possible.

Table I(c) shows the average, maximum and minimum risk
for the lines. Notably, both the average and minimum line risk
for de-energized lines is smaller for shorter forecast horizons,
indicating that more low-risk lines remain de-energized due to
an inadequate restoration budget.

restoration actions, along with a DC power ﬂow dispatch and
load shed. Recall that the optimization problem considers a 4-
day forecast horizon, but that we only implement the actions
for the current day (before reoptimizing the next day).

1) Total system risk and load shed: We ﬁrst analyze the
impact on total system risk and total load served for this
baseline case. Fig. 2a shows the total system risk value without
(orange) and with (blue) power shut-offs, and Fig. 2b shows
the total load without (orange) and with (blue) power shut-
offs. In the ﬁrst few days of the case study, the grid risk is
moderate. A small number of lines are de-energized to reduce
the risk, but no load shed occurs. On Oct 29th, a large spike in
risk occurs, leading to a signiﬁcant grid shutoff, and resulting
in around 5% load shed for this day. On Oct 30th, the wildﬁre
risk values return to moderate levels, and sufﬁciently many
lines are restored to avoid signiﬁcant load shed. However, we
observe that the total system risk after accounting for power
shut-offs is lower than the total system risk without accounting
for power shut-offs because many lines remain de-energized
due to limited restoration resources.

2) Geographical allocation of risk and load shed: Next,
we analyze how the load shed and wildﬁre risk is allocated
geographically in the system. Figure 3 shows the state of the
grid (top) and the wildﬁre risk values for each line (bottom)
on Oct 28, 29 and 30. On Oct 28, there are several lines
with risk values Rijt > V that are de-energized, but these de-
energizations do not result in any load shed. On Oct 28, the
wildﬁre risk has increased dramatically in the eastern region
of the grid in 3e. This results in a large portion of the lines in
this region to be turned off, as seen in 3b, but high risk lines
remain energized to continue serving power. In total, there is
partial load shed at 2 buses and total load shed at 3 buses. By

D. Sensitivity to Forecast Accuracy

As observed in Fig. 1b, there are substantial forecast errors
associated with the wildﬁre risk forecast. To test the impact
of forecast errors on the results, we solve the same MOPS
problem as above with forecast horizons varying from 1 to 7

Fig. 4: Variation in different objective value components for different
forecast horizons (not scaled by α).

Overall, we conclude that fewer lines are de-energized
when a longer horizon is used, resulting in higher overall
wildﬁre risk but a smaller system vulnerability. The reason
behind this trend is that a shorter time horizon does not allow
the optimization problem to consider system vulnerability in
future time periods and thus limits its ability to adequately
plan restoration efforts.

days, but assume perfect information about the future wildﬁre
risk (i.e., we use the realized risk data for each day rather than
applying the risk forecast made for each day). Table II shows
the resulting objective value components for each problem.
When comparing these and other results to the solutions
obtained with the forecasted data (discussed above in Table
I), we observe that the solutions are more or less identical
(although the solution time is slightly lower).

To explain this surprising result, we provide a deeper
investigation of the optimization solutions for the scenarios
using forecasted and realized risk. We consider the result
of one multi-period optimization problem for October 25th,
using the risk forecast and the realized daily risk values,
respectively. We choose to investigate this day because the
forecast was particularly poor, and under-estimated the wildﬁre
risk for the following 7 days. Figure 5 shows the risk values
for both cases, with forecasted risk in blue, realized risk in
orange and the vulnerability threshold in red. The forecasted
risk for each individual line was almost entirely below the
vulnerability threshold, while the realized daily risk was above
the vulnerability threshold for many days. On Oct 29, many
lines exhibited a wildﬁre risk that was twice as high as the
vulnerability threshold. Because of the difference between the
forecasted risk and the realized daily risk, we might expect a
very different shutoff plan to mitigate the risk for the problem
based on the forecasted vs the realized wildﬁre risk. For the
initial conditions, we use the state of the grid on Oct 25th
from the 7-horizon problem that uses the wildﬁre risk forecast,
where lines 29, 54, 68 and 118 are de-energized.

Figure 6 shows the wildﬁre risk of the total system. The
dashed lines represent the total risk without de-energizations,
while the solid line shows the power system risk after compo-
nents have been de-energized using the solutions of the MOPS
problem. Blue and orange corresponds to the solutions with
forecasted and realized wildﬁre risk. The total risk without
shut-offs is identical on Oct 25th since both solutions leverages
the realized wildﬁre values for this day, but the wildﬁre risk
forecast expects the risk to reduce over time while the realized
risk instead increases.

Table III shows the total number of line de-energizations and
re-energizations using for each solution, along with the miles
of restored lines. Over the course of the horizon, the solution
based on the forecasted risk de-energizes only 4 lines, while
the perfect information solution based on realized wildﬁre risk
de-energizes a total of 55 lines. This indicates that the forecast
errors have a signiﬁcant impact on the solution for later time
steps in the forecast horizon.

However, only the decisions for the ﬁrst day (which are
based on the true realized risk in both solutions) are actu-
ally implemented before the de-energization schedule is re-
optimized. We observe that the de-energization decisions made
here are identical: lines 29, 54, and 68 are still de-energized
on Oct 25, while line 118 has been re-energized. Thus, the
optimization problem for the next day (when the forecasted
risk values are updated) will have the same starting point.

From these results investigation, we conclude that the use
of the current, realized risk values in day 1 of the optimization
problem makes the problem signiﬁcantly less sensitive to
there are situations where even
forecast errors. However,
the ﬁrst day solutions based on forecasted and realized risk
deviate. For example, if the forecasted risk is signiﬁcantly
overestimating the future wildﬁre risk,
the problem based
on the forecasted risk may choose to shut down more lines
than the problem with perfect information and struggle with
restoring them sufﬁciently quickly.

E. Sensitivity to Restoration Budget

The restoration budget Yt determines how many miles of
transmission lines can be restored each day, and impacts both
the number and length of lines that are de-energized and
restored. To assess the impact of the restoration budget on
the solutions, we solve the MOPS problem for each day in
our 21 day horizon with different restoration budgets. Table
IV shows the result of varying the restoration budget on the
objection value (top), the number of de-energized and restored

lines and how many miles were restored (middle) and the risk
associated with energized and de-energized lines (bottom).

For the objective function value in Table IV(a), we observe
that the total objective value increases by a few percent as the
restoration budget increases. The objective value correspond-
ing to the served load remains the same independent of the
restoration budget. However, a larger restoration budget results
in a larger total system risk, but a smaller system vulnerability.
This is because lines that were de-energized during periods of
high wildﬁre risk can be restored faster once their risk falls
below the vulnerability threshold.

Table IV(b) compares the number of lines that are de-
energized or restored, as well as the miles of restored lines. We
observe that a larger restoration budget signiﬁcantly increases
both the number of de-energized and restored lines. Further,
solutions with a small restoration budget de-energize many
more lines than they restore, leaving a large number of unre-
stored lines at the end of the horizon. The average length of
the restored lines, computed by dividing the miles of restored
transmission lines by the number of re-energized lines, also
increases from 11 miles/line (with a restoration budget of 25)
to 28 miles/line (with a restoration budget of 125). This implies
that the system operator would be more willing to shut off long
lines if sufﬁcient restoration capacity is available.

Table IV(c) shows that the average, minimum and maximum
wildﬁre risk of transmission lines change as we increase the
restoration budget. In particular, the average risk of energized
lines increases, while the maximum risk decreases. Both the
average and minimum transmission line risk for de-energized
lines increases as the restoration budget increases. This is
because a larger restoration budget allows us to restore de-
energized lines with low risk more quickly, thus keeping fewer
of them in the de-energized state.

F. Sensitivity to Vulnerability Threshold

The vulnerability threshold V can be interpreted as a
threshold beyond which the wildﬁre risk is considered suf-
ﬁciently high to justify shutting down a line, even if it

reduces redundancy of the electric grid. If the wildﬁre risk
Rijt < V , we pay a penalty in the objective function for de-
energizing line ij at time t. Thus, the result of increasing the
vulnerability threshold is to keep higher risk lines energized.
In the following, we ﬁrst compare solutions with and without
the vulnerability threshold. Then, we assess how changing the
vulnerability threshold changes the solution.

1) Comparison of solutions with and without vulnerability
threshold: To demonstrate the beneﬁt of including a vulnera-
bility threshold that penalizes the shutoff of low-risk lines, we
make two different comparisons.

First, we set the trade-off parameter α = 0.7 and solve
the rolling horizon problem for 21 days using two different
vulnerability thresholds. Figure 7(a) and (b) shows the network
status on October 29th, the highest risk day, for V = 0 and
V = 100. We observe that the solution with vulnerability
threshold V = 0 is incentivized to turn off even comparatively
low risk lines, leading to many more de-energized lines and
the
signiﬁcantly more load shed (in red). In comparison,
solution with V = 100 only disables a few lines are disabled
in the eastern edge of the grid and many redundant lines are
maintained, maintaining some resiliency in the network. The
two solutions serve 1413 MW and 2038 MW of load and
have a wildﬁre risk of 4,920 and 114,220, respectively. We
thus conclude that a non-zero vulnerability threshold promotes
more system redundancy and higher load served for a given
value of α, but also has signiﬁcantly higher wildﬁre risk.

Next, we want to compare solutions with different vul-
nerability thresholds that serve a similar amount of load.
To achieve this, we use V = 0 and decrease α until the
solution serves 2038 MW of load (the same as we obtained
for V = 100). This result is obtained when α = 0.2, and the
resulting system conﬁguration for October 29 is shown in Fig.
7c. We observe that with V = 0, the network conﬁguration
is poorly connected and results in 10 islands and 6 single-
bus microgrids. In addition, within the islands all network
connections are radial with no redundancy, leaving the system
vulnerable to any unplanned outages that may occur. However,
the risk of wildﬁre in this network is 50,379, less than half of
the solution with V = 100 that serves a comparable amount
of power. This trade-off between system vulnerability and
redundancy on the one hand and wildﬁre risk reduction on
the other highlights the inherent challenges of operating power
systems in areas with high wildﬁre risk.

2) Comparison of solutions with different vulnerability
thresholds: After demonstrating the beneﬁt of incorporating
a non-zero vulnerability parameter V , we investigate how
the choice of V impacts the solution. We solve the MOPS
problem for the 21 day period with three different values
V = {75, 100, 125} and compute similar comparison met-
rics as presented for other cases above. The impact of the
vulnerability threshold on the objective function components
is listed in Table V(a) and shown graphically in Fig. 8. The
total objective value is reduced by 25% as the vulnerability
threshold is increased. This happens primarily because the
risk is three times higher for the case with a vulnerability
threshold of 125 compared with a vulnerability threshold of
75. This wildﬁre risk increase outweighs the decreased in

system vulnerability.

A higher vulnerability threshold reduces the number of de-
energized lines as seen in Table V(b). With V = 125, only
21 high-risk lines are de-energized, and all lines are restored
by the end of the horizon. Further, the minimum risk of any
de-energized line is 140, as seen in Table V(c). Thus, we can
conclude that the group of de-energized lines corresponds to
the few lines with a very high risk in Figure 1a.

One major impact of increasing the vulnerability threshold
is a decrease in the solve time of the problem. A vulnerability
threshold of 75 results in a total solve time of 2,676 seconds,
compared to 7.5 seconds when the vulnerability threshold is

125. We believe a higher threshold limits the number of lines
that are beneﬁcial to de-energize, and allowing the mixed-
integer solver to identify optimal solutions more quickly.

IV. CONCLUSION

Wildﬁre threats to power grid infrastructure are increasing,
and public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) represent an effective
short-term method to reduce the risk of wildﬁre ignitions by
the electric grid. However, PSPS are challenging to plan due
to the time-varying nature of wildﬁre risk, as well as the need
to limit the size of power outages that may last for several
days while utility crews work to restore power. To address this
challenge, we propose a rolling horizon optimization problem,
the Multi-period Optimal Power Shutoff (MOPS) problem,
that co-optimizes decisions on where and when to de-energize
power lines while also providing a schedule for how to restore
them. The MOPS problem is implemented in a rolling horizon
framework where the schedules are re-optimized on a daily
basis as new information about wildﬁre risk become available.
We apply the proposed method to the RTS-GMLC system
to analyze the performance as well as the sensitivity to the
forecast horizon, forecast errors, restoration budget, and vul-
nerability threshold. We ﬁnd that (i) a longer forecast horizon

shed, (ii) the solution is relatively insensitive to forecast errors
related to the wildﬁre risk, (iii) a larger restoration budget
allows for disabling and restoring more lines, and (iv) a higher
vulnerability threshold incentivizes more system redundancy,
thus increasing operational security but also wildﬁre risk.

The proposed framework has some limitations and pro-
vides several avenues for future work. First, the vulnerability
threshold is not a comprehensive metric for system security,
and additional modeling efforts are needed to capture more
standard metrics such as N-1 security. Second, the model
uses a linear approximation of the power ﬂow to accelerate
the solution time, but this may lead to solutions that are
not AC power ﬂow feasible. In addition, despite the linear
approximation, the problem can still be very slow to solve even
on a small network. The development of heuristic solution
techniques may be necessary to plan a PSPS on a realistic
scale power network. In future work, we aim to develop
algorithms that can solve MOPS in real-time for large systems
during wildﬁre risk events and incorporate constraints that
guarantee the resiliency and reliability of PSPS solutions to
additional contingency events. We hope to eventually solve an
AC-feasible MOPS problem with N-1 security constraints for
a synthetic version of the California grid.
