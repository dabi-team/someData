ABSTRACT
Recent years have seen the rapid deployment of low-cost CubeSats
in low-Earth orbit, primarily for research, education, and Earth
observation. The vast majority of these CubeSats experience sig-
nificant latency (several hours) from the time an image is captured
to the time it is available on the ground. This is primarily due to
the limited availability of dedicated satellite ground stations that
tend to be bulky to deploy and expensive to rent. This paper ex-
plores using LoRa radios in the ISM band for low-latency downlink
communication from CubeSats, primarily due to the availability
of extensive ground LoRa infrastructure and minimal interference
to terrestrial communication. However, the limited bandwidth of
LoRa precludes rich satellite Earth images to be sent – instead, the
CubeSats can at best send short messages (∼ a few hundred bytes).
This paper details our experience in communicating with a LoRa-
enabled CubeSat launched by our team. We present Vista, a com-
munication system that makes software modifications to LoRa
encoding onboard a CubeSat and decoding on commercial LoRa
ground stations to allow for satellite imagery to be communicated,
as well as wide-ranging machine learning inference on these images.
This is achieved through a LoRa-channel-aware image encoding
that is informed by the structure of satellite images, the tasks per-
formed on it, as well as the Doppler variation of satellite signals.
A detailed evaluation of Vista that builds upon wireless channel
measurements from the LoRa-CubeSat launch (in 2021) shows 4.56
dB improvement in LoRa image PSNR and 1.38× improvement in
land-use classification over those images.

1 INTRODUCTION
The massive reduction in costs of launching satellite payloads [20]
has led to a proliferation of CubeSats in Low Earth Orbit and
truly democratized access to space for small players – researchers,
students and satellite enthusiasts. Today, such CubeSats target
varied geo-sensing and imaging applications and number in the
thousands[30]. However, a key question that bottlenecks for Cube-
Sats from small players is the answer to a simple question: “Is my
satellite online right now, and if so, what is it imaging?”. Most cur-
rent CubeSats rely on existing wireless technologies, developed for
larger satellites, for downlink communication. However, ground sta-
tions for these technologies are extremely expensive to rent/install
for small teams – with most teams able to downlink from Cube-
Sats quite rarely – often once per few hours [65], i.e. whenever a
ground station is in range. Imagine a time-critical event that occurs
during this long window where the satellite is simply inaccessible.
For instance, consider an interesting Earth image that needs to
be sent downlink. Such images could be time-sensitive, capturing
on-Earth emergencies such as flooding or weather events around

Figure 1: Vista enables practical imaging and inference ap-
plications for LoRa CubeSats within a single packet

specific locations on the ground observed by the CubeSat. In this
paper, we study if low-latency access to satellites can be enabled
by re-using existing, global ground radio infrastructure rather than
building one from scratch – specifically, commercial LoRa base
stations. In particular, we see a LoRa chip on CubeSats as a quick
and dirty add-on to push timely information from a CubeSat to
the ground anywhere in the world – not as a full-on replacement
satellite communication system.

The reasons behind why LoRa is an attractive wireless technol-
ogy to communicate with CubeSats in a timely manner is three-fold:
(i) There is a vast existing ground infrastructure that continuously
listens for LoRa packets that can be used to receive packets around
the globe. (ii) It’s chirp-spread-spectrum narrowband modulation is
immune to much of the on-ground communication in these bands.
Further, it has been shown that other technologies also are affected
minimally due to LoRa traffic at these frequencies [32, 66]. (iii) It
accommodates a large number of transmitters simultaneously.

Yet, there are two key challenges in communicating data from
LoRa-equipped CubeSats to existing ground stations – the limited
bandwidth of LoRa and a highly lossy wireless medium. These
stem from a mismatch between the typical LoRa client (a mostly
static terrestrial device deployed a few kilometers away) and a
CubeSat (a device in space moving at seven kilometers per second
and hundreds or thousands of kilometers away). In fact, theoretical
analysis of the impact of these Doppler effects on LoRa at high
frequencies[37] has shown high amount of packet drops and error
in detection. Indeed, that is why most of the recently launched
LoRa CubeSats [6, 7, 13, 18] operate at lower frequencies (137 MHz
and 407-450 MHz) and leverage specialized receivers instead of
leveraging existing 915 MHz ISM band ground infrastructure.

In this paper, we describe our experience in building wireless
communication link from LoRa-enabled CubeSats in low-earth
orbit designed to better communicate with existing ground LoRa
infrastructure in the ISM band. We present Vista, a CubeSat commu-
nication system that uses conventional LoRa modulation to directly
deliver image information with high efficacy, by overcoming the
challenges of limited bandwidth and infrastructure compatibility.

 
 
 
 
 
 
We first study the performance of LoRa communication in the ISM
band through the development and launch of a LoRa CubeSat. We
then use wireless channel measurements from this CubeSat in space
to then demonstrate that Vista can provide an effective 55.55% lower
latency, 4.56 dB improvement in image retrieval SNR and 1.38×
improvement in classification tasks over the images.

The rest of this paper details Vista’s approach to address these
challenges, namely: (1) Enabling existing LoRa ground station in-
frastructure to detect and decode CubeSat LoRa signals. (2) Design-
ing channel-aware solutions for encoding images and performing
inference on these images over the bandwidth-starved CubeSat
LoRa links.

Connecting LoRa CubeSats with ground infrastructure: En-
gineering a terrestrial LP-WAN technology to communicate at a
range fifty times larger than its conventional range is a challenging
task. We require a precise optimization of the design space at the
satellite to maximize the throughput of the link by choosing the
correct configuration in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor.
Further, we must remain compatible with existing ground stations
to effectively detect and decode these packets. At the CubeSat, we
describe how a LoRa CubeSat should be designed to overcome
challenges with motion in space – specifically as small satellites
of about 1U (1000 cubic centimeters) tumble quite significantly in
orbit. We show how these constraints inform antenna design as
well as incur spectrum policy considerations on the ground as well
as space. At the ground stations, Vista addresses the problem of the
large attenuation and massive Doppler shift that render the pack-
ets from CubeSats undecodable at pre-existing LoRa base stations.
Vista mitigates this by leveraging existing hardware modules that
operate at various different bandwidths – that LoRa traditionally
provides as part of its data-rate adaptation pipeline. We show how
a careful selection of these pre-existing correlation modules can
enable terrestrial ground stations to detect these missed packets
with a simple software update. Sec. 3 describes these solutions for
both satellite ground stations and the LoRa CubeSat.

Channel-Aware Image Encoding: Given this bandwidth-starved
CubeSat link, it is critical to maximize the utility of every byte to
communicate data downlink. We specifically focus on communi-
cating image data for the purpose of performing inference tasks. A
näive solution to compress images captured from the camera would
be to use traditional compression algorithms such as JPEG with
appropriate compression ratio. Yet, there exists an exciting opportu-
nity in the satellite image context, where rich prior information is
available in how these images are structured, e.g. image data from
NOAA LEO weather satellites [11]. Further, compression of image
data can also be actively guided by the nature of machine-learning
tasks performed on these images. Most importantly, one can also
account for the nature of the wireless channel between CubeSats
and the LoRa ground stations, where factors such as intra-packet
Doppler shift, noise, and satellite trajectories play a key role in the
nature of image bit errors one can expect. In other words, rather
than building a channel, data and task-agnostic image compres-
sion scheme, Vista designs an image encoding that is informed by
the general nature of wireless channels, the structure of satellite
imagery, and the tasks performed on this data.

Unlike prior work in joint source-channel coding for wireless
image transmission[28, 29, 31, 35, 44] which deals with general
uniform error distributions, operating LoRa (a technology that en-
codes data in frequency shifts) in 915 MHz ISM band (large amount
of Doppler) leads to a non-uniform distribution of errors across
bits. Sec. 4 describes our design of a data-task-driven autoencoder
which is optimized for such space-to-ground wireless channels. We
train this autoencoder with real satellite image data, our satellite
trajectory, as well as our own LoRa channel measurements. We
further make this encoding resilient to information loss due to dis-
cretization and wireless impairments. We provide various design
points in our autoencoder that balances the diversity of tasks that
can be performed with the image encoding on the ground and the
amount of data that needs to be communicated.

We study Vista through the development of a communication
stack and launch of a LoRa-enabled satellite in the ISM band in
2021 [1, 5]. We study and report the overall signal-to-noise ratio, ob-
served Doppler effects and improved ground-station latency of this
LoRa satellite. We then collect long-term wireless channel traces
measured from the satellite in orbit across an year. We implement,
evaluate and emulate various flavors of Vista on these channel mea-
surements to showcase the potential benefits in terms of latency,
packet detection and inference accuracy, demonstrating:

• 55.55% reduction in latency with a coverage across 44.92%
of the CubeSat orbit vs. 33.27% of existing infrastructure.
• Up to 15 dB improvement in SNR for packet detection in

high Doppler scenarios.

• 4.56 dB PSNR improvement in images retrieved and 38%
improvement in accuracy of ML tasks over images commu-
nicated using Vista.

Contributions: Our contributions include:

• A novel CubeSat wireless communication system that uses
conventional LoRa modulation to enable high-quality image
inference over bandwidth starved links.

• A system that makes software modifications to commer-
cial LoRa ground gateways to detect highly Doppler shifted
packets from LoRa CubeSats.

• Detailed implementation and evaluation through wireless
channel measurements from a commercial LoRa enabled
satellite launched by our team.

2 OVERVIEW
Vista is a CubeSat communication system that uses LoRa modula-
tion at the satellite and conventional ground infrastructure, making
software-only modifications at both ends to improve delivery and
processing of images. Fig. 2 depicts Vista’s contributions. The rest
of the paper discusses the two key components of Vista’s design.

Enabling LoRa CubeSat – Ground Station Links: We showcase
the design decisions behind LoRa CubeSats [5] built by our team
to communicate in the 915 MHz ISM band. We next show how we
can redesign existing commercial off-the-shelf LoRa base stations
to detect and decode CubeSat packets accounting for the extremely

Figure 2: Vista develops channel aware data-task driven encodings and Doppler-resilient packet detection to enable fine-
grained imaging and low-latency inference from LoRa-enabled CubeSats

high Doppler shifts these packets experience. Sec. 3 describes our
solution.

Channel-Aware CubeSat Image Encoding: At the satellite,
Vista encodes satellite images ensuring resilience to Doppler and
other wireless impairments, while remaining cognizant of satellite
image structure and higher-layer inference desired on images. At
the ground stations, Vista decodes images and/or performs desired
inference on the images, such as identifying land use patterns. Sec.
4 describes Vista’s solutions at both the CubeSat and the ground
infrastructure.

3 LORA CUBESAT AND GROUND STATION

DESIGN

This section describes the principles behind the LoRa transmitter
design on a CubeSat and the challenges and issues to overcome for
enabling a robust downlink from the satellite. Further, we describe
our approach to empower the ground infrastructure to improve
packet reception from CubeSats.

3.1 LoRa CubeSat Design
In this section (and this paper), our focus is solely on the LoRa
wireless communication related design decisions for the CubeSat.
We refer the reader to [5]1 for comprehensive description of other
(non-LoRa communication) aspects of the CubeSat design – in-
cluding on on-board compute, storage, energy efficiency, etc. We
primarily describe some of the key design decisions to keep in mind
while building LoRa-enabled CubeSats. At first glance, one would
think that simply using existing off-the-shelf LoRa components
connected to a power amplifier in the transmission chain would
work as a CubeSat transmitter natively. However, there are mul-
tiple challenges and design decisions that are critical to optimize
the communication downlink from the low-earth orbit (LEO): (1)
LEO Spectrum Policy in the ISM band; (2) Antenna Design for the
CubeSat transmitter; (3) Choosing Transmission Parameters.

1Reference anonymized for double blind review. [5] describes the detailed com-
pute/storage/control system design of the satellite hardware, in contrasts to the LoRa
communication aspects which are the sole focus of this paper (Vista).

Figure 3: Vista Satellite Design

Spectrum Policy: There are two entities that govern the spectrum
in the low-earth orbit. The first is the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC) [33] that provides licenses to US-flagged spacecraft
(i.e. any US company, university) for communication from satellites.
The other entity is National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) [54] which provides special permissions for
experiments on spacecraft backed by US government (i.e. NASA).
The only policy-wise complicating factor in 915 MHz band [34] is
that, it is specially allocated for federal civil and naval operators for
radio-location services among others. However, recent meetings
between these two entities point towards building a unified spec-
trum policy in the near future [53]. The CubeSat built by our team
operates in the ISM band for evaluating 915 MHz LoRa downlink
communication at a bandwidth of less than 125 KHz.

Another obvious concern is to design geo-location awareness.
Off-the-shelf GPS typically is locked by CoCom2 at altitudes higher
than 18 kms and for clients faster than 0.5 m/s. Thus, our satellite
used a GPS receiver with CoCom limits removed to ensure compli-
ance. However, the GPS did not lock due to a very important reason
– small 1 unit CubeSats tumble significantly in space (sometimes
up to 7.5 revolutions per minute). Thus, providing geo-location
awareness for spectrum usage to such small satellites remains an
open challenge. Our LoRa CubeSat transmits keep-alive beacons at
the ISM band as is typical for most satellites.
Antenna and Transmitter Design: The LoRa CubeSat uses a
HopeRF RFM95PW (operates similar to SemTech SX1257) trans-
mitter with an in-built power amplifier as the RF front-end for

2Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls

Figure 4: Vista UHF Antenna Beam Patterns

modulating the data using LoRa modulation. This brings the output
wireless transmit power to +27 dBm. The final component is to
design an antenna to communicate with the ground infrastructure.
An obvious constraint is the size of the CubeSat which limits our
design to the 10 × 10 × 10 cm3 volume. But an even more impor-
tant design decision is to identify whether the antenna should be
directional.

In an ideal scenario, it is clear that a directional antenna will
provide additional gain improving the achievable throughput for
the link. Unfortunately, small CubeSats tumble quite significantly
in space – meaning that directionality would simply be counter-
productive. Further, as LoRa packets can be as long as 2 seconds,
this tumbling can cause a large deviation in SNR within a single
packet rendering it undecodable. Thus, the antenna on the CubeSat
attempts to achieve as close to isotropic propagation beam pattern
within the spatial constraints of the CubeSat while remaining tuned
to 915 MHz. Fig. 4 demonstrates the beam pattern of antennas on
the CubeSat.
Choosing Transmission Parameters: After designing the phys-
ical hardware for the transmitter, it is critical to maximize the
throughput from the link to ground infrastructure. The key fac-
tors that govern the overall throughput of the CubeSat-ground
infrastructure link are – how frequently the CubeSats transmit and
amount of data in every packet.

The number of downlink transmissions is primarily governed by
the energy available at the satellite throughout the day. When the
CubeSat is facing the sun, it generates energy in fast-charging mode
at the rate of 1W while it generates 0.5 W in trickle-charging mode
when in eclipse. Given this coarse estimate of power generation
and other transmission parameters, we can choose the number of
transmissions per second based on the power available per packet.
The satellite transmits one packet every 30 seconds in our case.

Further, the transmission power should be set to the maximum
possible from the software end. The next important trade-off is
to choose the spreading factor (SF) and bandwidth for the LoRa
transmitter. The throughput, energy consumption and SNR coding
gain of LoRa transmissions varies as:

𝑆𝐹

Throughput ∝

𝐵𝑊
2𝑆𝐹 ; Energy ∝ 𝐵𝑊 × 2
At first glance, a simple approach of choosing the lowest band-
width and choosing the spreading factor based on the SNR gain
required looks promising. However, there is another factor that
affects the packet decoding on the ground stations – Doppler (see
Sec. 3.2). Since Doppler shift in the 915 MHz band is significantly

; SNR ∝

2𝑆𝐹
𝐵𝑊

Figure 5: Unlike CubeSats operating at lower frequencies,
traditional LoRa base stations cannot cope with the amount
of Doppler present in LoRa CubeSats in the ISM band

larger than the low frequency amateur bands, low bandwidth pack-
ets are more likely go undetected. While we show later (in Sec. 3.2),
how by carefully configuring ground stations we can achieve re-
silience to these shifts, these detection thresholds also add an ad-
ditional constraint on the transmission parameters. The CubeSats
developed by our team operates in the 525 km LEO orbit operating
at 915.6 MHz used SF 8 and 62.5 kHz bandwidth for communicating
downlink.

3.2 LoRa Ground Station Design
Conventional LoRa ground infrastructure (operating at the 915 MHz
ISM band) is not designed to receive LoRa signals from CubeSats.
Further, any approach to specialize the existing ground infrastruc-
ture would negate the latency gains of leveraging existing infras-
tructure. Primarily, there are two key differences between the sig-
nals received at LoRa base stations from terrestrial sensors and
those from the CubeSats. First, the satellites are traveling at speeds
of several km/s (∼7 km/s for our satellite), much larger than any
terrestrial mobile LoRa clients. Second, is the fact that CubeSats
operate in the low earth orbit (300 km - 800 km altitude ; 525 km for
our CubeSat) which is a significantly larger distance. At the core,
the base station needs to perform two tasks: (1) Detect and Decode
the CubeSat packets, and (2) Know when the CubeSat is overhead.

Detecting and Decoding LoRa CubeSat packets: The attenua-
tion of the transmitted signal at the base station in a good pass
(∼90𝑜 elevation peak) is roughly 150 dB at an average. This leads
to an average received power of -123 dBm significantly above the
detection threshold of off-the-shelf LoRa base stations (-148 dBm).
Fundamentally speaking, by leveraging the existing infrastructure
(high gain antennas and LNAs), it is entirely feasible to detect and
decode signals from the LoRa CubeSats. Indeed, prior deployments
on hot-air balloons have demonstrated communication as far as
832 km using LoRa [63]. Thus, existing LoRa infrastructure with
high-gain antennas can easily overcome its range bottleneck.

However, the massive amount of Doppler shifts in the CubeSat
context present a difficult challenge. While LoRa was developed to
be inherently resilient to terrestrial Doppler (a few Hz), the amount
of Doppler seen from these CubeSats is on the order of several
kHz (a significant proportion of the bandwidth). This means up

Figure 6: Correlation of preambles and SYNC symbols with
wideband correlators enables high Doppler packet detection
and accurate Doppler estimation

to a third of the signal might be outside the receiver bandwidth.
Along with the large communication range, this renders a large
fraction of the packets undetectable (see Fig. 5). If one were to use
a software-defined radio with wide bandwidth, it would be easy
to collect the raw signal data and post-process it to overcome this
bottleneck. Instead, Vista takes the approach of re-configuring ex-
isting LoRa base stations with a simple software update to estimate
and overcome Doppler.

Packet Detection using wideband correlators: The key reason
for packet loss due to Doppler in LoRa base stations is because the
correlation peak is far outside the bandwidth of the sampling unit
at the receiver. To overcome this challenge, we trade-off some noise
resilience for improved Doppler robustness. Specifically, we set the
receiver to the widest bandwidth correlators (250 kHz) and leverage
that even low-bandwidth LoRa preambles can correlate with these
wideband correlators. To see why this is possible, consider Fig. 6:
Notice that carefully configured correlators at 250 kHz share com-
mon signal fragments with those at lower bandwidths. However,
only some fragments match (four out of eight preamble signals in
Fig. 6 (top)), meaning that this process results in a 3 dB reduction
of detection SNR – trading off some SNR resilience for improved
detectability. At this point, Vista can simply estimate Doppler using
the SYNC symbols of a larger bandwidth (much like traditional
LoRa) to obtain a coarse estimate of Doppler frequency shift. We
illustrate this process in Fig. 6 (bottom).

Satellite trajectory to inform Doppler and vice-versa: As the
above approach of estimating and correcting Doppler requires us to
use wider preambles and accumulates more noise, it becomes critical
for the base station to know when the CubeSat is overhead to switch
into high Doppler-resilient mode – trading off SNR for detectability.
However, most small CubeSats cannot be tracked by ground radars
for the first few weeks (out of a mission life of one year – the most
critical time for a CubeSat mission) [2] – owing to being highly
clumped up in a volume with other entities launched with them.
However, the few initial Doppler measurements obtained from our
LoRa ground stations can help us indirectly inform satellite orbits,
indeed much earlier than ground radars can capture them. These
orbital measurements can then directly inform future expected
Doppler values for these same satellites in subsequent passes.

We use a simplified version of prior Doppler-to-orbit mod-
els [42, 43] to estimate the trajectory from our coarse Doppler
measurements using the algorithm described in Alg. 1. While there
are many more complex and accurate models for estimating the
trajectory from Doppler estimates, our results in Sec. 7.3 really
highlight the improvement in trajectory estimation due to better
Doppler estimation by Vista. Upon estimation of this trajectory,
we can leverage this information in future packets to get more

accurate Doppler estimates of the incoming packets. Note that we
can also use this information to reduce the bandwidth of correla-
tor symbols to improve the SNR of reception. Finally, we can use
this modified Doppler estimate to correctly decode the communi-
cated information on the ground infrastructure and leverage it for
decoding images and performing tasks.

4 CHANNEL-AWARE CUBESAT IMAGING
In this section, we describe our physical layer approach that effi-
ciently encodes images into the constraints of a LoRa packet (only
256 bytes each) while maximizing the accuracy of output of tasks
performed at the ground.
Current approaches: Traditional approaches to compress images
such as JPEG, TIFF and PNG are not designed for such low storage
regimes (hundreds of bytes). This is due to the fact that much of the
compression achieved using these approaches relies on carefully
designed dictionaries, hash tables and encoding schemes, all of
which take space to store for decoding the image. Thus, to achieve
any coherent image communication, we can only rely on two con-
ventional compression approaches: subsampling and reducing bit
resolution of every pixel. Subsampling reduces the spatial resolu-
tion of the image while the reduced bit resolution adds corruption
due to discretization. Fig. 7 demonstrates a few configurations that

Figure 8: Vista preserves much of the useful information in
the images for inference and imaging

demonstrate significant loss of features, motivating the need for
better solutions.

Figure 9: Vista uses two-stage training to make the autoen-
coder channel-aware – Stage 1: learning noise and Doppler;
Stage 2: calibration to discretization loss

4.1 Data-Channel-Task Aware Approach
To ensure useful data compression within the constraints of LoRa
packet size, Vista’s key idea is to leverage important known in-
formation about the images collected by CubeSats, the wireless
channel that the signals propagate over, and tasks performed on
the ground. Specifically, we consider: (1) features extracted from a
large dataset of typical satellite images, (2) a broad set of tasks that
are typically performed on those images, and (3) a well-modelled
LoRa-CubeSat channel.
Data Awareness: We first rely on the vast amount of Earth images
taken by larger satellites in similar orbits (NOAA [11], Sentinel [17])
to learn how best to compress the images. One approach would
be performing a statistical analysis and identifying the patterns
across images. Vista instead chooses a more automated approach
that learns these patterns using a convolutional autoencoder.

Task Awareness: Further, this autoencoder can be optimized not
only for reconstructing the images but also directed towards pre-
serving maximal task-specific information. We design a common
encoder for both image and task-recovery that is actively aware
of the set of tasks that are intended to be performed at the ground.
This loses a small amount of performance in both tasks but retains
maximal information feasible for each task.

Our main rationale for designing task-aware encoders stems
from a well-understood challenge in machine learning [70]. Specif-
ically, certain stages of our encoder, in the process of compression,
may be viewed as a series of projections onto lower-dimensional
spaces. Should the data encoding be unaware of tasks performed,
it may inadvertently drop critical information pertaining to these
tasks. This happens due to the encoder projecting onto spaces or-
thogonal to those critical to our task – which Vista actively avoids.

Channel Awareness: Finally, training and evaluating this autoen-
coder must account for bit-errors that these LoRa wireless packets
typically encounter. We design a channel-task-aware image en-
coder that maximizes the output accuracy while being constrained
to the limits of a LoRa packet. We do so by a two-stage process
where the auto-encoder learns about noise, intra-packet Doppler
shift, and discretization losses. As shown in Fig. 8, the output of our
solution preserves much of the useful information in the images
for inference and imaging.

4.2 Vista Autoencoder Design
As we designed an autoencoder, we needed to make a decision
between different types of autoencoders – two of the common ones
being convolutional (Convolutional Neural Networks) and fully
connected (Artificial Neural Networks).

A CNN-based Design: We choose CNN over ANN due to three
reasons: (1) CNNs capture spatial features better, (2) CNN weights
require less amount of data to be stored on CubeSats, or even
communicated upstream (15kB vs. 24MB), (3) CNNs require signif-
icantly smaller amount of compute and storage resources during
evaluation.

Deciding CNN Depth at the CubeSat: Next, it is critical to de-
cide how deep the network needs to be. A general rule of thumb is
that deeper networks achieve better accuracy. However, much of
the computation is designed to occur on the CubeSat, which has
severe computational constraints. We choose to perform three con-
volutional layers on the satellite to maximize the accuracy-compute
tradeoff. However, on the ground, we are relatively less resource
constrained, and hence can have more layers. Our architecture
co-optimizes for both tasks and image reconstruction using two
parallel CNNs via a fully connected layer.

Our autoencoder design (shown in Fig. 2) builds on conventional
wisdom from traditional convolutional autoencoder designs. As we
go from the image towards the signature, we increase the number
of convolution features captured by each layer and decrease the
size of filters. This allows the Vista autoencoder to preserve the
maximum amount of information while ensuring progressive com-
pression. After each layer, we pass the output via a Rectified Linear
Unit (ReLU layer) to capture non-linear behaviors which in turn
maximizes the ability of Vista to improve over simple subsampling
and other linear baseline approaches. Finally, we use a tanh layer
to constrain the output between (-1 and 1).

LoRa Payload and Channel: This output is then discretized to
a low-bit representation and sent in a single packet with 256 byte
payload. We note that encoder output size and discretization is
primarily limited by available bandwidth. These trade-offs can be
task specific, as well as dictated by the wireless channel and we dis-
cuss these issues in Sec. 4.3. The packet undergoes various wireless

communication impairments with two of the major factors being
the noise and Doppler. Note that these CubeSats travel at 7.6 km/s
at an altitude of 500 km, leading to massive Doppler offsets. At the
receiver, the LoRa base station decodes the packet and retrieves the
communicated values.
Decoder Design: At the decoder, this signature is then passed on
to a fully connected layer to distribute the input to two separate
networks optimized for image reconstruction and labelling tasks,
respectively. For image reconstruction, we have successive layers
of upsampling, convolution, and ReLU to increase the spatial di-
mensions to that of the original image. Note that, during image
reconstruction, we have to effectively reverse the compression pro-
cess with minimal loss. To achieve this, we increase the filter size
in a similar way to that of the encoder. For the labelling task, we
have successive layers of convolution and ReLU layers with a final
sigmoid layer to output the probability of belonging to a class.

Training the Network: We use the Mean Squared Error loss

We then train our network with five-fold cross validation on the
training data to avoid overfitting while ensuring maximum accuracy.
As shown in Fig. 9, our training occurs in two stages: In the first
stage, the network learns about the noise and Doppler related bit-
errors. In the second stage, it compensates for the discretization
loss. Note that both these stages of training will occur on the ground
a priori and, hence, can be performed over a long time to converge.
However, despite the simple architecture, there are several design
decisions taken to improve resulting accuracy.

4.3 Channel-Aware Autoencoder Design
Next, we discuss how to make our autoencoder resilient to impair-
ments of the CubeSat-LoRa Ground Station wireless channel: noise,
intra-packet Doppler shift, and discretization.

Modeling noise: Noise causes LoRa chirps to be misclassified
randomly across the frequency shifts. This means that each bit has
an equal likelihood of bit-flip regardless of the location of the chirp.
To estimate this error, we use the LEO satellite channel model as
shown in [55]. We estimate the symbol error rate (SER) using the
theoretical model in [22]. Based on measurements from our LoRa
CubeSats launched in 2021 [1], our average SNR of -10 dB from
these traces at LoRa ground stations correspond to roughly 10−4
SER. This directly corresponds to a BER of 10−4.
Intra-packet Doppler:
Intra-packet Doppler affects bit errors
asymmetrically. To understand how, we first need to understand
how a LoRa chirp is decoded: The receiver typically deconvolves
an incoming chirp with another upchirp to ascertain the frequency
shift relative to the frequency shift of the preamble. Thus, generally
much of the Doppler is overcome by the preamble and one would
assume there would be no effect on the decoding process. While
this is true for traditional wide-band satellite transmissions lasting
a few millisecond, many LoRa packets last several hundreds of

Figure 10: LoRa symbols face an additional frequency shift
due to accumulation of Doppler across the packet. Unlike
gaussian noise which affects all bits of a symbol uniformly,
intra-packet Doppler affects the LSB more than the MSB

Figure 11: Intra-packet Doppler affects symbols in a packet
asymmetrically. The error likelihood in frequency bins off-
set follows an exponential distribution.

milliseconds. This means a significantly larger amount of Doppler
accumulates over the duration of the packet, causing the relative
offsets of chirps near the end of a packet to be severely deviated
from the start of the packet (Fig.10a).

Doppler-induced frequency shifts lead to the decoded chirps
shifting into nearby bins. This phenomenon of mis-classification
into nearby bins instead of random frequency bins leads to the asym-
metric effect across bits (Fig.10c). Remember that most adjacent
bins only differ in the least significant bits, while the most signifi-
cant bits(MSB) only change across massive frequency shifts(LSB).
In fact, going from the MSB to the LSB, the likelihood of each bit
getting affected increases exponentially. Thus, we need some way
to inform our network model of this asymmetry. Further, simply
using the approach of specializing the decoder would not work in
this situation as this is critical for the encoder to understand during
encoding. Fig. 11 shows the distribution of symbol errors across
symbols and the likelihood of amount of frequency bins shifted.

To model this effect, during the first stage of training, we add
an additional layer that multiplies the input by a bit-flip operation
layer. For a one bit output, we achieve this by creating random
bit vectors of bit flips and then convert them to a (-1,1) vector (-1
signifying bit flip). Note that that in a one-bit output scenario, the
output of the tanh layer lies between (-1,1) which means a simple

can be just a blue blob and there will be little information lost. On
the other hand, an image of an industrial complex will lose drastic
amounts of information about small details. The only potential way
to solve this dilemma is to evaluate the loss on the prior available
data across both axes and use the least error configuration. Our
evaluation shown in Fig. 12 shows that the optimum configuration
näively operates at 4-bits.

However, we can do even better. We ask a simple question: “Can
the decoder learn and specialize for this discretization to maximize
the accuracy of the output of the image and tasks?” The first obvi-
ously direct approach would be to create a differentiable model of
such discretization and add it as an additional layer to the neural
network. However, such discretization is neither continuous nor
differentiable. Further, unlike XOR, there is no guarantee that it
can be estimated with a small enough neural network. Instead, we
take an indirect approach to teach this behavior to our decoder: We
first freeze the encoder as it is already optimized to best represent
the image in the limited set of bins. We affect the output of the
encoder with the necessary discretization to create an intermediate
input. We then relearn the decoder parameters for the image output
on these affected intermediate inputs. Our results show how our
approach minimizes information loss and maximizes the accuracy
across configurations.

5 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS

Open Challenges: Based on our experience launching the Cube-
Sats, it is quite evident that there are several problems that need
to solved to enable robust connectivity from CubeSats to ground
infrastructure. On the CubeSat, the list of open challenges range
from enabling secure robust geo-location to designing new antenna
designs and modulation schemes. On the ground station, it is crit-
ical to develop new hybrid base stations that can simultaneously
serve terrestrial as well as CubeSat clients and accurately estimat-
ing the trajectory of these clients in the critical first month of their
operation. Finally, there is a new opportunity for data scientists to
maximize the utility of these bandwidth-starved CubeSat links by
building better and more robust data-driven encodings.

Limitations: Our evaluation is limited in the following aspects:
(1) Actual end-to-end testing on the satellite is infeasible as ground-
truth image information is unavailable due to limited satellite band-
width. (2) Emulating high level Doppler offsets on the ground is
infeasible as the orbital velocity of Vista satellite is 7 km/s. Thus,
we use the signal measurements from our launched satellite to
perform trace driven evaluation. (3) We use images from public
LEO satellites as candidate packet payloads for our trace-driven
emulation. Note that these are not from CubeSats due to limited
public data of satellite imagery specifically from CubeSats.

6 IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
Our evaluation leverages signal and channel measurements from
the CubeSat to inform Vista’s approach to overcome the wireless
challenges described in the paper. As shown in Fig. 14, our model
mimics all the subtle behaviors of the satellite pass from attenua-
tion to Doppler. We implement a ground-based evaluation testbed
that emulates CubeSats attenuation and Doppler behavior using

Figure 12: Discretization of the encoding propagates to the
output of the decoder

multiplication layer with our bit mask will work. Further, as this
bit-mask remains constant during an epoch, the multiplication layer
is both continuous and differentiable. Thus, during emulation of
the bit-error, the gradient will also propagate over our layer and
hence get corrected automatically. Note that this makes the network
aware of the behavior of these errors and maximizes accuracy for
the resulting image and task.

A new problem arises when each output is represented by multi-
ple bits: The correct way to emulate bit flips would be to take our
bit mask and XOR with the output of the encoder. However, it is
well known that the XOR operation is not continuous or differen-
tiable. To address this, we use a known approximation of the XOR
operation [8] by a 2-layer neural network for the number of bits
required to XOR. Hence, we add this XOR black box in place of the
multiplication layer where the inputs to the XOR are given by our
bitmask. This enables multi-bit outputs to learn the behavior of the
bit error distributions caused by intra-packet Doppler.

Modeling Discretization Loss: Another source of error is dis-
cretization. Remember that we are limited to communicating only
2048 discrete bits while the output of most neural networks are
floating point integers. Thus, we need to reduce these 4 byte float
output elements to a few bits causing information loss. This means
that if we use a 2×32×32 sized output, we can only send one bit
of each floating point number to the actual decoder. On the other
hand, using a 1×16×16 output for the encoder would allow us to
communicate 8 bits of information to the output. As one can imag-
ine, both of these scenarios severely affect the ability of the decoder
to decode this input into coherent output.

To address the problem of discretization, we first attempt to
understand how it affects the output of the decoder. Our observation
on a well-trained CNN suggests that the discretization loss at the
input of the decoder propagates to roughly equal information loss
in the output. For example, the output of the 2×32×32 encoder
becomes a single bit-mask on the output of the decoder. On the
other hand, 1×16×16 image output suffers significantly less loss.
However, this image output looks half the resolution of the image
output of 2×32×32 image, as each of the distorted pixels in the
image is much larger, spanning double the number of underlying
pixels.

The average information loss for k-bit discretization is equal to
1
2𝑘+1 . However, it is quite difficult to quantify the amount of informa-
tion lost due to reduction in spatial resolution. For instance, a lake

inclination angle of 97.52o. The baseline can communicate only 2-4 packets compared to 15 encodings of Vista.

conventional approaches varied between -10 to -30 dB. However,
Vista solutions can improve the packet detection SNR significantly
by approaches mentioned in Sec. 3.2 and evaluated in Sec. 7.2
Baseline: As shown in Fig. 13, the baseline of subsampling (Sec. 4)
and communicating images will lose several packets without getting
decoded. However, comparing our solution with pure noise would
be unfair. Thus, we assume that packets were somehow detected
for evaluation.

Training the channel-aware autoencoder: The training hap-
pens in two stages: (1) In the first stage during training we add the
noise and Doppler layer (weights set to not change internally) and
train the Vista on training data. (2) In the second stage we freeze
the weights of the encoder and first generate intermediate inputs
as suggested in Sec. 4.3. We then discretize them to fit within our
communication budget of 256 bytes. We train the decoder chain on
this discretized input to calibrate for the discretization losses.

Evaluating Vista: Fig. 15 shows an example run of how Vista
evaluation is performed. The input image is encoded at the encoder
to output the signature which is then discretized and modulated
atop LoRa. It is then passed through the channel model informed
by wireless channel measurements and analyzed noise and Doppler
channel in Sec. 4.3. At the receiver, the signature is demodulated and
passed to the decoder for outputting class labels and reconstructed
image. For image reconstruction, we use the mean squared error
loss and for classification, we estimate the confusion matrix. The
baseline is optimally subsampled to minimize information loss as
shown in Fig. 7. It is then passed through the same architecture
without the discretization, noise and Doppler effects to ensure
ceteris paribus comparison.

Datasets used: We use publicly available labeled dataset with im-
ages captured from Sentinel-2, EuroSat Land Use Dataset [45]: 27000
13-channel 64×64 images with 10 seperate land use labels. For our
evaluation, we restrict ourselves to RGB channels as those are the
ones that image captures.

7 RESULTS
In this section, we begin with evaluating two basic primitives behind
Vista: packet detection rate (Sec. 7.2) and trajectory optimization
(Sec. 7.3) on LoRa hardware. We then present our main results
for the end-to-end Vista system based on the Sentinel-2 images for

served channel measurements that can replicate Vista Cube-
Sat channel behavior

Note that the CubeSat did not receive NORAD ID up to 7 weeks
after the launch due to the reasons explained in Sec.3.1. This was
a critical motivation behind our solution for identifying a way to
detect the trajectory for receiving packets and useful information
in the first few days of a future mission. The output power from
the CubeSat was 27 dBm and the received SNR on the ground with

trajectory of Vista satellite across Feb 1, 2022 to Feb 3, 2022. LoRa ground infrastructure operating in the ISM band can enable
lower latency compared to other ground station infrastructures in developing regions of the world.

TLE information above obtained from NORAD, we use the loca-
tion of our satellite across a year in space to evaluate the potential
latency of retrieving information from any of these networks.

Results: Fig. 16 shows the latency across trajectory of the satellite
using various ground infrastructure during two days of operation.
It is quite evident that across many developing regions (e.g. West
Africa, Greenland, Indian Ocean Islands) where it is difficult to
develop and deploy expensive specialized ground infrastructure,
leveraging existing LoRa deployments in ISM bands provide a clear
win. Our evaluation across a year of Vista trajectory (shown in
Fig. 17) demonstrates that that leveraging the widely deployed
915MHz LoRa ground infrastructure will enable significantly lower
latency of image downlink compared to using generic satellite
ground stations or specialized LoRa infrastructure. Across the orbit
of an year, LoRa infrastructure at 915 MHz provides a coverage of
44.92% compared to 33.27% of TinyGS and 21.23% of SatNogsDB. In
terms of 90%ile latency, using Vista for LoRa CubeSats can poten-
tially reduce latency by up to 55.55%.

7.2 Packet Detection Rate

Setup: We evaluate the efficacy of Vista’s wider correlators in de-
tecting Doppler offset packets. We use off-the-shelf Semtech SX1262
base stations to receive LoRa packets with increasing Doppler off-
sets and measure the limit of packet detection limits. We also mea-
sure the received signal power across offsets using SemTech SX1257
base stations (with access to I/Q samples) for Vista’s wider correla-
tors over standard narrowband decoding.

Results: Our measurement study in Fig. 18a demonstrates that
the frequency offset estimation limit of our wideband correlators
is as good as the widest correlators supported by the hardware.
Further, using these correlators adaptively shows large gains in
SNR reaching up to 15dB when Doppler is as large as the bandwidth.
Further, packet detection limits quadruple the resilience to Doppler
shifts compared to baseline LoRa base station. As shown in Fig. 13,
this could lead to multiple-fold increase in packet throughput when
receiving signals from a single CubeSat pass. Note that additional
interference may reduce the gains but Vista’s approach will always
be superior to native LoRa receivers.

image reconstruction (Sec. 7.4) and multi-task optimization (Sec. 7.5)
driven by traces measured from our recent satellite launch.

7.1 Latency Benefits

Setup: We evaluate the potential latency benefits of using exist-
ing LoRa ground stations (operating on the 915 ISM band) over
specialized ground infrastructure such as large generic satellite
base stations or LoRa ground stations in lower UHF bands. Now,
it is virtually impossible to know the locations of every possible
ground station in all of these categories and thus we endeavor
in procuring the publicly known locations of these ground sta-
tions on three platforms : The Things Network[21] (terrestrial LoRa
network), TinyGS[19] (LoRa grounds stations operating at lower
bands), SatNogsDB[14] (Satellite Ground Stations). Assuming the

7.3 Accuracy of trajectory optimization

Setup: We use the state-of-the-art Doppler-to-orbit models [42, 43]
to emulate the behavior for LEO trajectory in terms of Doppler,
we vary the trajectory across values of maximum elevation (𝜃𝑚𝑎𝑥 ),
inclination angle (𝜙) and start time of transmission (𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 ). We also
add additional frequency noise as expected from a real satellite
due to angular velocities, offset estimation resolution and other
factors. We then use Vista’s approach to estimate the trajectory
using Alg. 1.

Results: Our results show that using the preamble along with the
sync symbols achieves 4× better frequency offset estimation reso-
lution compared to only two sync symbols (see Fig. 18b). Further,
due to the better resolution in measuring the offset estimate, we
can estimate the trajectory with a resolution of 1.2o in inclination
angle (𝜙) and 0.5o in max elevation (𝜃𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) which is comparable to
the accuracy of available TLE files for much bigger satellites [2](see
Fig. 18c). Further, the inclination angle remains consistent within a
margin of 1o over the lifetime of a CubeSat, which can be further
used to refine Doppler measurements.

7.4 Accuracy of Image Reconstruction

Setup: Our model (Fig. 2) uses a fully-connected layer to co-train
two parallel CNNs optimized for image reconstruction and multi-
class land-use classification with 50-50 (5120 images each) train-test
split. The dataset is taken from [45] which contains labelled images
captured from Sentinel-2 [17] satellite in 13 different spectrums
from an altitude of 800km. However, recall that a CubeSat will likely
not have a high resolution camera as well as multi-spectrum sens-
ing capabilities. We hence choose only the RGB spectrum inputs to
classify the image into the 10 labelled land-use patterns: Sea & Lake,
Annual Crop, Forest, Herbaceous Vegetation, Highway, Industrial,
Pasture, Permanent Crop, Residential and River. For the baseline,
we leverage a subsampled image with dimensions 3 channels 9×9
pixels with 8 bit resolution as input. For the data-aware approach,
we specially train a Vista autoencoder specifically for reconstruct-
ing images with a waist of 2 channels 16×16 pixels with resolution
of 4 bits per pixel. Finally, Vista’s approach co-trains two parallel

CNNs optimized for image reconstruction and multi-class land-use
classification.

Results: Fig. 19 shows that the baseline’s per pixel error is signifi-
cantly larger than Vista’s approach. One of the crucial characteris-
tics to observe is that the 90th percentile error is especially larger
for the baseline which means while in some cases the baseline may
do well, as more fine grained features get involved the reconstruc-
tion becomes much worse. For example, a lake may be easier to
identify from even a low-resolution image of the baseline while
an industrial complex is far more challenging to make out. This
lower mean squared pixel error of 5.42 (compared to 9.17) leads
to an average 4.56 dB improvement in image SNR. Note, however,
that Vista’s approach was not specialized for image reconstruc-
tion but also for accomplishing task using the same 256 bytes of
information. A specialized network such as data-aware approach
which is specialized for image reconstruction may perform even
better at image reconstruction but will perform poorly at tasks.
This is due to the fact that the latent space of compression is not
necessarily tuned in the right dimensions for the task. Thus, we do
not consider this method as a fair comparison with our system for
image reconstruction.

7.5 Accuracy of Multi-Class Classification

Setup: Our setup remains identical to Sec. 7.4 above, with the
testing performed for land-use multi-class classification.

Results: As shown in Fig. 19b, Vista’s approach outperforms both
the baseline approach as well as data-aware approach significantly
leading to 72.92% accuracy in classifying the images compared to
52.5% and 57.09% accuracy of the former over 5120 test images
(512 images for each class). The classification tasks where Vista’s
approach achieves much of its gains are those which require high
resolution intricate details such as outlines of buildings for residen-
tial and industrial complexes (higher spatial resolution). Further,
industries and highways are both made of concrete (grey colored)
and are hence confused much more in the baseline. The classifica-
tion error that Vista makes are primarily between structures like
rivers and highways that both represent narrow lines between land

or between permanent crop and vegetation. Note that a fine-tuned
13-channel 2-layer CNN (roughly comparable to our 4-layer nar-
row waisted CNN) achieves 84.48% classification accuracy in the
original work [45] from which this dataset was obtained. But since
we use only three channel RGB, our classification accuracy is lower
than it.

8 RELATED WORK
In this section, we elaborate on the extensive related work done
in the field of satellite communication, LoRa communication, and
various image compression schemes.

LoRa CubeSats: Past work has explored improving the range [36,
39], throughput [41, 62, 69], scalability [40, 41, 46, 58] and reliabil-
ity [22] of LP-WANs. Prior systems [52] have also delivered images
over LoRa by communicating images over several packets. However,
CubeSats don’t have the luxury of perennial coverage.

The idea of using LoRa for CubeSats has been explored by both,
companies such as Swarm Technologies [18] and Lacuna Space [9]
to provide global IoT connectivity, and hobbyists as a simple off-the-
shelf technology for communication [49] over long ranges. Much of
this prior work relies on dedicated ground stations[19] that operate
at lower frequencies (such as 137 MHz and 450 MHz) instead of
traditional LoRa base stations that operate in the ISM band. Fur-
ther, while there is some theoretical analysis on understanding
LoRa behavior in CubeSat scenarios, most of these miss impor-
tant aspects that become apparent when the CubeSat is actually
deployed such as Doppler[38], ignore PHY layer considerations
[56], As highlighted in Sec. 3.2 and 4, there are two key issues
that particularly hinder enabling connectivity for LoRa satellites
in the ISM band – (1) Packets go undetected due to limitations of
LoRa ground infrastructure (Fig.5) [15, 16, 24, 37, 50] and (2) Intra-
packet Doppler generates heterogeneous errors that are atypical of
wireless channels. Vista provides new solutions informed by our

CubeSats channel traces in the ISM band (Sec. 3) to overcome these
limitations.

CubeSat Communication and Satellite Imaging: There has
been much work on development of satellites for various ap-
plications spanning agriculture, atmospheric monitoring and re-
mote sensing. On one end, are publicly funded programs such as
NOAA [11], Sentinel [17], LandSat [10] with large historical data,
where academics have recently shown new opportunities[60, 61] in
developing novel ground architectures for receiving image data. On
the other hand, are private enterprises entering this space such as
Planet Labs [12], Microsoft [64, 65] and Boeing Aerospace [3]. There
has been also much work in characterizing the trajectory [27, 59]
and channel [48, 55] of these LEO satellites. All of these above
deployments are big satellites or large CubeSats (≥ 6 unit), and
leverage high throughput wideband technologies to communicate
to ground infrastructure. Vista addresses the unfortunate conse-
quences of using narrowband technologies in LEO – the lower data
rate as well as high Doppler-to-bandwidth ratio. Further, small
CubeSats [1] face the unfortunate issue of tumbling in space which
does not affect the larger satellites due to compensation mecha-
nisms (Sec. 3).
Error-Resilient Image Compression over wireless links:
Imaging is one of the most important applications for today’s Cube-
Sats with usecases in weather monitoring, satellite imaging, cloud
detection, agriculture, etc. [23, 25, 26, 45, 51, 72]. Most deep learn-
ing networks on images leverage convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) which self-learn filters for various tasks [4]. These images
are then typically compressed using autoencoders (deep neural net-
works with narrow waist) to create signature optimized for a set of
tasks [57, 67, 71]. These narrow outputs are used to communicate
between the sensor and the receiver as they maximize informa-
tion density for a set of tasks [47]. Unfortunately, if autoencoders
are trained unaware of the communication channel, there is large
information loss due to discretization, and bit errors [68]. There
is of course a lot of work in joint source-channel coding for wire-
less image transmission[28, 29, 31, 35, 44] which deal with general
uniform error distributions seen in typical wireless channels. How-
ever, operating LoRa (a technology that encodes data in frequency
shifts) in 915 MHz ISM band (large amount of Doppler) leads to

a non-uniform distribution of errors across bits as described in
Sec.4.3. In this paper, Vista shows how, by making these autoen-
coders aware of this non-uniform distribution in the LoRa CubeSat
context, we can design extremely small encodings robust to an
adverse communication channel (Sec. 4).

9 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presents Vista, a LoRa-based CubeSat communication
system that allows delivery of quality of image information for wide-
ranging tasks to commodity commercial ground stations. This is
achieved through a LoRa channel-aware image encoding scheme
that is informed by the structure of satellite images, the tasks per-
formed on them, and the physical-layer channel characteristics of
satellite signals. We present a detailed evaluation of Vista by lever-
aging wireless channel measurements from from recent CubeSat
launched by our team. Our results demonstrate a 4.56 dB improve-
ment of recovered image quality and the 1.38× improvement in
accuracy of land-use classification. We plan to deploy Vista end-to-
end on a future CubeSat mission to estimate our system’s ability
for varied Earth sensing applications.
