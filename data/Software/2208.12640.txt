Abstract

The purpose of this study is to introduce ANN-
based software for the fast evaluation of rotor-
dynamics in the context of robust and integrated
design. It is based on a surrogate model made of
ensembles of artiﬁcial neural networks running in
a Bokeh web application. The use of a surrogate
model has sped up the computation by three or-
ders of magnitude compared to the current models.
ARRID offers fast performance information, in-
cluding the effect of manufacturing deviations. As
such, it helps the designer to make optimal design
choices early in the design process. The designer
can manipulate the parameters of the design and
the operating conditions to obtain performance
information in a matter of seconds.

1. Introduction

The design of gas-bearings supported turbomachinery is a
complex task, since it involves the design of different compo-
nents such as the gas-bearings, the rotor, the electric motor,
and the turbomachinery aerodynamics. In the early design
process, multi-objective optimization can be used to ﬁnd
a Pareto optimal design (Massoudi et al., 2022). However,
before sending the design to production, the engineers often
need to perform small modiﬁcations to accommodate manu-
facturing processes, which may impact the performance of
the system. To be able to immediately assess the impact of
such modiﬁcations, the ARRID framework was developed
with the following goals in mind:

1. Fast and accurate computation through the use of en-

sembles of artiﬁcial neural networks

2. Pertinent visual information on the performance robust-

ness of the turbocompressor

2. Integrated and robust design

Design in engineering is complex. It involves sequential
mappings from the technical scope of speciﬁcations to the
process variables via the deﬁned functional requirements
and matching design parameters (Nordlund et al., 2015).
Different performance metrics and objectives need to be
assessed under constraints. Ideally, all the subsystems need
to be designed together to obtain an optimal design, framed
integrated design (Schiffmann, 2015). Often, designing for
the nominal point is not sufﬁcient as operating conditions
and manufacturing are subject to tolerances. Hence, there is
a need for robust design against manufacturing deviations,
which should satisfy the constraints of the technical scope
of speciﬁcations, while maintaining excellent performance
(Hasenkamp et al., 2009).

Design is also an iterative task. For the design of turbo-
machinery as an example, the designer starts from a 0D
model to obtain a ﬁrst guess of a subset of the system de-
sign dimensions (Mounier et al., 2018). From there, the
design is reﬁned along with sequential steps with models of
increased ﬁdelity (2D, 3D). Should the design not perform
as intended, the designer must make modiﬁcations earlier
in the design sequence and run new calculations. Obtaining
a correct initialization is therefore paramount in making the
design process effective.

3. Gas-bearings supported turbocompressors

Target applications for small-scale turbomachinery are com-
pressors for fuel cells and heat pumps. Herringbone grooved
journal bearings (HGJB) are laser-engraved gas-bearings al-
lowing the supported rotor shaft to spin at high speeds, while
achieving a high lifetime with minimal maintenance (Gu
et al., 2020). The gas-bearings are self-lubricated by the thin
ﬂuid layer surrounding the rotor and entrapped by the stator.
Hence, there is no need for oil lubrication, eliminating the
risk of pollution in the process.

A limitation of the application is the sensibility of the ro-
tordynamic system stability to manufacturing deviations
(Guenat & Schiffmann, 2019). The rotor system is in the

tens of millimeter range, whereas the laser engraved grooves
are in the order of micrometers. While laser engraving is
accurate to the micrometer on the groove depth, meeting
nominal bearing clearances in the order of 5-10 micrometers
requires signiﬁcant manufacturing effort. In this context,
a robust design is achieved by maximizing the feasible re-
gion of the gas-bearings supported turbocompressor under
deviations of local bearing clearance and groove depth.

A ﬁnite difference scheme is used to compute the bearings
stiffness and damping of the gas-bearings using small pertur-
bations from the concentric position. Excitation frequencies
are swept and the logarithmic decrement, metric of stability,
is computed via an intersection method (Geerts, 1995). Al-
though this process is fast - in the order of magnitude of the
second - it is not fast enough to provide immediate informa-
tion about the robustness of the design. As a consequence,
we use feed-forward artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) to
build a global surrogate model to accelerate the compu-
tations, while retaining reasonable accuracy (Goodfellow
et al., 2016).

4. Structure of the surrogate model

The surrogate model is made of ensembles of six ANNs
blocks (Ganaie et al., 2021). The ANNs are trained using a
data-driven approach using a model of a rigid gas-bearings
supported rotor (Schiffmann & Favrat, 2010). A genetic
algorithm is used to identify the hyperparameters of the net-
work to minimize the training loss function (Harvey, 2017;
Papavasileiou et al., 2021). Four ensemble blocks are used
to predict the stability of the rotor. A ﬁrst classiﬁer predicts
if the system is in an excited mode and a second one predicts
whether the design is stable. A regressor then predicts the di-
mensionless excitation frequency known as the whirl speed
ratio. The last regressor predicts the logarithmic decrement.
Each of the four excitation modes is treated by a sequence
of four ensemble ANNs blocks.

5. An interactive visualization of the

performance of the system using bokeh

ARRID is a Bokeh dashboard where the user can load, edit,
and visualize a rotor and its performance in stability, load
capacity, and power losses. Bokeh is a Python library used
to create interactive visualizations in web browsers (Bokeh
Development Team, 2022) and is used here as a web appli-
cation running on a server. ARRID features are described
on Figure 1.

The user can load a rotor design by typing the name of the
ﬁle to be loaded in the Text widget and pressing the Load
Button widget. The rotor is formatted as a series of cylin-
drical elements with up to three layers of different materials
embedded in a Matlab structure. It is then converted to a

Python dictionary. Each cylindrical element has the fol-
lowing properties which can be changed by selecting and
modifying the DataTable widget :

• L: length in m

• di=1,2,3: inner diameter of layer i in m

• Di=1,2,3: outer diameter of layer i in m

Two of the cylinders can then be deﬁned as the journal
bearings and a third one as the thrust bearing. The following
parameters are updated respectively for both journals (same
topology), and the axial bearing using the Sliders widgets:

• α, the groove-ridge width ratio

• β, the groove angle

• γ, the grooved region ratio

• hg, the groove depth in µmu

• hr, the local bearing clearance in µm

• ∆hr, the deviation from hr in µm

• ∆hg, the deviation from hg in µm

The operating conditions can also be deﬁned by the user via
the Select and Spinner widgets:

• f luid, the ﬂuid used to lubricate the bearings

• P a, the ambient pressure at the bearings in P a

• T , the ambient temperature at the bearings in K

• N , the target rotational speed in m

Callbacks are implemented so that output plots are updated
as the computation button is pressed in the dashboard:

1. A plot made of rectangles representing the rotor

2. A tab for the plots of the robustness of the radial bear-

ings

3. A tab for the plots of the robustness of the axial bearing

In this call, the Python dictionary describing the rotor is
updated. Calls are made to the functions computing the
mass and moments of inertia of the whole rotor. A sensitiv-
ity analysis for local bearing clearance hr and local groove
depth hr is performed as well as a sweep of the nominal
speed. From the dimensional values, dimensionless groups

are computed and inputted into the ANNs. The ANNs com-
pute the whirl speed ratio and logarithmic decrement for
the whole input dataset. This data is then fed to the plots of
the robustness of stability, load capacity, and losses against
manufacturing deviations for radial and axial bearings re-
spectively. The plot describing the rotor is also updated.
The whole process takes less than a minute when using a
modern GPU to perform the computations against dozens
of minutes when using the base models.

6. Conclusion

This framework helps the designer achieve on-the-ﬂy modi-
ﬁcations to the design and evaluate its overall nominal and
robust performance.

1. The use of surrogate models accelerates by two orders
of magnitude the computation of the performance of
the gas-bearings supported turbocompressor

2. The dashboard offers pertinent visual information to
help the user understand the performance of the gas-
bearing supported turbocompressor upon variation of
its design parameters and operating conditions

3. The designer is offered an interactive tool to help in
decision making by validating at early stage modiﬁca-
tions needed for manufacturing

Figure 1. ARRID is written in Python using the Bokeh library. It is displayed in the local browser upon execution. The user selects the
folder (1) where the rotor deﬁned by its ﬁlename (2) is located. It is loaded using the Button widget (3). Operating conditions are deﬁned
in (5), (6), (7) and (8). The rotor and its dimensions in mm are displayed on the interactive ﬁgure (9). Its geometry can be further analyzed
and edited in the DataTable widget (10). Journal bearings (HGJB) and axial bearing (SGTB) geometries and computation accuracy are
selected with sliders (13). Sliders widgets are also used to deﬁne the position of the bearings (14). Pressing the ”Compute” button (4)
starts the evaluation of the performance and the robustness of the rotor against manufacturing deviations. The results are displayed on
interactive contour plots for the journal bearings (11) and the axial bearing (12). Tabs allow the user to switch between the performance
metrics of stability, load capacity and power losses.
