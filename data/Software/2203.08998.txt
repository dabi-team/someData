Abstract. Gravitational waves (GW) from eccentric binaries have intricate signals
encoding important features about the location, creation and evolution of the
sources. Eccentricity shortens the merger time, making the emitted GW statistically
predominant in the observed data once detectors will reach the required sensitivity.
We present a novel implementation of fully analytical GW templates from eccentric
binary black hole (BBH) mergers within the Wolfram Mathematica software. We
increase the accuracy by identifying and minimizing the possible source of errors. We
start with an overview of the physics involved in eccentric mergers, then assemble the
strain for the inspiral by employing up to six post-Newtonian (PN) corrections. We
complete the eccentric inspiral with the quasi-circular Backwards one Body (BoB)
merger model in frequency, amplitude and phase, then we build the hybrid GW
strain for the whole evolution of the binary. For low eccentricity we reach coincidence
in the overlap, with no ambiguity in the time interval, a remarkable improvement
from the usual matching techniques. For high-eccentricity we compensate for the
implicit quasi-circular assumption of the BOB approach, by introducing a small
rescaling in amplitude. Our streamlined implementation is relevant for the new ﬁeld
of GW astronomy and is straightforward to understand, use and extend, oﬀering
researchers in the ﬁeld a valuable open resource tool.

1. Introduction

In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits and his three famous
laws of planetary motion. Since then, it is universally accepted that all binary systems
move in elliptical orbits around the center of mass. This empirical observation was

used by Newton to build the law of universal gravitation, unchallenged for three
centuries, until Einstein introduced the theory of general relativity (GR) in 1915. This
theory explained the observed slight precession in the elliptical orbit of Mercury,
known as the relativistic perihelion advance. More important, it showed that a binary
is bound to spiral inward and circularize by releasing orbital energy as gravitational
waves (GW) until the inevitable collision occurs. It may seem like a rare scenario that
two compact objects lock each other into a collapsing orbit. However, stars are usually
born in pair, and more than 70% of their population is massive enough to end up
either as a black hole or a neutron star [1].
By the time they reach Earth, GWs have extremely small amplitudes, with an
expected strain on a given length of about 10−20. This makes their detection very
challenging and possible only for very strong gravity, as in the case of the two merging
black holes ﬁrst detected by the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (aLIGO) in September 2015 [2]. This discovery created a new branch of
science, the Gravitational-wave Astronomy [3]. The data and software employed in
those detections are freely available [4], enabling peer scientists to test and replicate
them [5], an essential requirement for the upholding of high scientiﬁc standards. text
All the detections reported until now come from circularized binaries, but this is not
necessarily because they had zero eccentricity [6]. The emission of GW decreases the
orbital eccentricity [7], thus very small eccentricity is expected close to the merger,
when the signal enters the sensitivity band of the current detectors, especially for
isolated compact binaries evolving for a long time. However, in certain populations of
merging binaries living in dense stellar environments, such as galactic cores and
globular clusters [8, 9], or in isolated triplets [10], eccentricity is present even at small
separations. Current ground-based detectors such as aLIGO and aVirgo, did not reach
yet the sensitivity levels required for the detection of eccentricity and are only tuned
to observe the brightest GW sources, in a limited frequency band, very close to
collision [11]. In the near future though, as the technical diﬃculties are solved,
detection of eccentricities will become possible [12]. However, next generation of
gravitational-wave observatories are being built and will come online within the next
decade [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Those instruments will be able to detect GWs with up
to 10 times increase in sensitivity and to discern signals at an earlier stage in the life of
the binary, when orbital eccentricity is still large and to track their evolution for a long
time. It is thus only a matter of time until eccentric GWs will be detected.
GWs with eccentricity are much richer in structure and they reveal valuable
information on how the binary came together, the medium in which the pair resides
and its long-time evolution [20, 21, 22]. Moreover, the eccentricity decreases the
merger time, meaning that GWs with eccentricity encoded in the signal will become
ubiquitous once detectors will have the demanded sensitivity. But to decipher any
such detection and to determine their proprieties, it is essential to have accurate
templates that are valid for small to moderate eccentricities. GW templates are
generated mainly using two families of models currently implemented in the LIGO

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

Scientiﬁc Collaboration Algorithm Library (LALSuite) [LAL], the Eﬀective-one-Body
approach (EOB) [23, 24, 25] and the phenomenological frequency domain model
(IMRPhenom) with its ﬂavors [26, 27, 28, 29]. Those waveform models are following in
essence the same two-steps procedure to construct complete templates for the signal,
from the time it enters the detector’s frequency band, through the peak of the
amplitude (”chirp”) emitted when the two black holes collide, until it gradually
becomes smaller, and ending when the ﬁnal black hole settles down. First, the binary
motion is split in three distinct regions: inspiral, merger, and ringdown, then diﬀerent
mathematical formalisms are applied to obtain the waveform for each region. Finally,
a complete GW template is generated for the whole evolution of the binary, by
matching those regions in time or in frequency.
The inspiral - or the weak ﬁeld region - is modeled using diﬀerent versions of the
post-Newtonian (PN) formalism, which obtains solutions to Einstein’s equations of GR
as higher-order expansions of Newton’s law of gravity in terms of the small PN
parameter xP N = v2/c2, also called the slowness. Here, v is the orbital velocity and c
the speed of light (see [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] for details on this analytical technique).
In the second region - during the merger - the orbital speed of the binary gets closer to
the speed of light, rendering the PN approximation invalid. Here the dynamics of the
binary is modeled by numerically solving Einstein’s equations of GR on
supercomputers and extrapolating at larger distance to calculate the resulting
waveform (see [35] for an excellent review). Informed by numerical relativity (NR)
[36, 37, 38, 26, 39, 40], the analytical models are extended to envelop the nonlinear
physics of the merger, by using either the empirical IMRPhenom approach [41, 42], or
the EOB reformulation the PN theory [43, 44, 45]. In the third region, the new black
hole formed after collision settles down by ringing out the extra energy in form of
quasi-normal modes radiation. In this region analytical models are valid again and the
GWs are calculated with the black hole perturbation theory [46, 47, 48, 49, 50].
The state-of-art methods mentioned above are continuously improved, driven by the
increasing demands of the GW detection. However, most of them are limited to
quasi-circular orbits (for good reviews see [51, 52]). The LALSuite data analysis
libraries has only one routine for generating eccentric GW templates based on [53], and
current analytical models including eccentricity [53, 54, 55] are under development to
increase the accuracy and include all the complex physics of elliptic binaries [56, 57].
Motivated by the impending detection of GWs from eccentric binaries, we align our
present work with the demand for eccentric waveforms and focus on accurately
implementing fully analytical, easily reproducible GW templates from eccentric binary
black hole (BBH) mergers. We construct a series of new, fully analytical notebooks
within the Wolfram Mathematica software for calculating the complete GW emitted
by compact binaries in eccentric orbits, by starting with their inspiral, following
through the highly nonlinear regime of the coalescence and ending with the ringdown
phase. We describe in detail how the entire template is built, by bringing together
valuable information from research papers that focus only on speciﬁc regions of the

orbit and exhibiting a high level of complexity hidden in scientiﬁc jargon, which makes
the problem hard to understand. We open this black box and bring its intricate
content to an approachable level, in a clear way, keeping the balance with the scientiﬁc
rigor. Our goal is for the reader to understand, follow and reproduce our results, even
without formal training in GW research.
Another novelty of our implementation resides in the construction of the hybrid GW
strain for the whole evolution of the binary, matching the eccentric inspiral with the
analytic quasi-circular Backward-one-Body (BoB) model [93] for the merger, by
completing them in frequency, amplitude and phase. We ﬁnd that for low eccentricity
we can connect the two waveforms with no ambiguity in the time interval, result
relevant for the production of accurate GW waveforms from eccentric binaries. Our
research is applicable to the ﬁeld of GW astronomy and oﬀers researchers in the ﬁeld a
new tool for generating eccentric GW, as well as a blueprint for understanding,
reproducing and extending our results, in order to reveal the physics of this kind of
sources, in preparation for their imminent detection.
We start our presentation with a review of the Keplerian problem for eccentric binaries
and its extension to the post-Keplerian parametrization in Section 2. We clarify the
complex physical and mathematical concepts required to solve analytically the
problem of motion when eccentricity is intertwined with strong gravity, a topic often
either overlooked, or hidden in heavy technical language. Our choice of solving the
post-Newtonian Kepler’s equation (based on [58]) is less used and has the advantage
that is purely analytical. We ﬁnish this section by outlining the steps followed to
assemble the analytic gravitational waveform during the inspiral. We continue in
Section 3 by exposing ﬁrst the diﬃculty in analytically determining the location of the
transition between the inspiral and merger, then we follow by summarizing the
important formulas employed by the merger model to arrive at the GW strain.
Once the theoretical framework is laid out clearly, it is time to detail our new
implementation and to explain how we built the complete waveform in Section 4. We
start by establishing the time bounds for the binary evolution in Subsection 4.1, then
we implement the inspiral waveform in Subsection 4.2 and in Subsection 4.3.
Lastly, we generate the complete GW template for the whole evolution of the binary in
Subsection 4.5, by matching the GW obtained for the inspiral with the merger GW in
amplitude, frequency and phase, at a ﬁxed transition time. We employ ﬁrst small
eccentricity, then we push the boundaries by devising a hybrid waveform for large
eccentricity. We conclude in Section 5 with a summary of our ﬁndings, their
implications for the ﬁeld of gravitational wave astrophysics, and suggest extensions.
We work in geometrized units with G = c = 1, thus expressing time, space and mass
function the mass of the binary system at inﬁnity M = M (kg)/M(cid:12)(kg) where M(cid:12) is
the mass of the sun. This allows an easy rescaling of our results for a given total mass.
The physical units are recovered by multiplying mass with M(cid:12)(kg) = 1.98892 × 1030kg,
space with M(cid:12)(km) = 1.477 km, and time with M(cid:12)(s) = 4.92674 × 10−6s.

2. Theoretical Framework: the Weak-Field Region

2.1. The Keplerian Problem

Let us start with an eccentric pair of two black holes reduced to material points of
masses m1 and m2, separated by a distance r, each revolving in elliptical orbits around
a common center of mass. This model is known as the two-body problem. Imposing the
conservation of momentum, this is further simpliﬁed to the one-body problem for a
single particle of reduced mass µ = m1m2/M and position r, moving in the external
gravitational ﬁeld created by the mass M = m1 + m2 located at the center of mass.
Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the position vector will be conﬁned to
the plane, allowing us to simplify the dynamics to a two-dimensional problem.
Moreover, because r = r(cos θ, sin θ), we only need to know how the angle θ varies in
time, to describe the motion of the point mass µ [59]. This deceptively simple, now
one-dimensional ansatz is also known as the Keplerina problem, but even in
Newtonian gravity it is very complicated to solve. At the heart of this model lies
Kepler’s equation, with its still unknown exact analytical solution, although scientists
tried to ﬁnd one for centuries. Luckily, we have analytical methods that approximate
this solution with the desired degree of accuracy [60].
At a a closer look, the elliptical orbit can be described by only four quantities: the two
extreme points that bound the trajectory, r− (periastron, or point of closest approach
to the origin) and r+ (apoastron or maximum distance from the origin), the
semi-major axis a = 1
2(r+ + r−), and the eccentricity

e =

r+ − r−
r+ + r−

.

(1)

We align the x-coordinate with the major axis of the ellipse and draw a circle of radius
a with origin in the center of the ellipse. Then, we raise a perpendicular from the
x-axis through the orbiting point-mass µ, thus projecting its motion onto this circle.
The motion is now reduced to a circular orbit on this reference circle described by the
angular coordinate u, called eccentric anomaly (see Fig. 1).
In order to calculate the angle u we must use the Kepler’s equation, deduced from
purely geometric considerations as a relationship between this eccentric anomaly and
the eccentricity of the ellipse:

(cid:96) = u − e sin u.

(2)

where (cid:96) = w(t − t0) is called the mean anomaly, and w = 2πt/P is the mean motion,
namely the angular speed of the body µ averaged over the period P of the orbit. This
quantity is measured with respect to the periastron, between (cid:96) = 0 and (cid:96) = 2π and
M a−3 [62]. Once we know this angle, we calculate
given by Kepler’s third law, w =
the separation with the shape equation r = a(1 − e cos u). The location of each star in
the binary with respect to the center of mass will be recovered with |r1,2| = rm1,2/M .
Kepler’s equation (2) is transcendental because it contains a trigonometric function
and cannot be computed exactly, although an exact solution should exist.

Over time, many numerical and analytical approximate solutions have been proposed,
and with the aid of computers we can calculate them with high degree of accuracy
[60]. We will use Bessel’s approach who, using the well known property that any
continuous function can be expanded in Fourier series, wrote the solution to Kepler’s
equation (2) as:

u = (cid:96) +

where Ji(x) are the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind [63]. This gives an
analytical expression for the eccentric anomaly, which is geometrically related to the
orbital phase φ, also known as the true anomaly, by the equation:

Once we know the orbital phase, in Newtonian gravity the problem is solved.

2.2. The quasi-Keplerian Problem

Up to this point we have not taken into account the loss of orbital energy due to the
emission of GWs. Let us now include this essential component into our treatment of
the binary’s orbit, while assuming that the orbit decays much slower compared to the
orbital period. This important conjecture, called the adiabatic approximation, allows
us to model the emission of GW with the balance equation, stating that the loss of
orbital energy is balanced by the ﬂux of GWs for a binary system in a slowly-evolving
circular orbit:

−

dE(t)
dt

= ˙E(t) = F(t).

(5)

Here, E(t) is the binding energy of the binary and F(t) is the energy ﬂux emitted in
GWs. This equation is valid for most of the inspiral, as long as the separation is large
and the orbital speed is much smaller than the speed of light, keeping the parameter

xP N (cid:28) 1. In this region the gravitational ﬁeld is weak and the GR equations can be
solved in terms of power series expansions of the parameter xP N , starting from the
familiar Newtonian two-body equation of motion. This is the post-Newtonian
formalism, introduced in fact by Einstein [64], and to the reader interested in learning
about it we recommend [65, 33]. This powerful and accurate method provides the
expressions for the binding energy and the emitted ﬂux, enabling us to integrate the
balance equation (5) and to obtain the evolution equation for the parameter xP N

.

The dynamics of the binary becomes much more complicated when we add eccentricity
to the orbit. Due to the ellipticity, the curvature of the orbit changes, making the
angle of the tangent to the orbit vary along the trajectory, eﬀect described by the
extrinsic curvature in GR. This theory assumes a four-dimensional spacetime, where
the orbit depends on how we chose the three-dimensional spatial slice in this 4D
geometry. This means that how we track the evolution of the eccentricity is not
invariant of the coordinate system, and will depend on how we deﬁne it. In
mathematical language, the eccentricity is not gauge invariant and depends on our
choice of coordinate system. To circumvent this problem, we employ again the
adiabatic approximation and assume that the change in eccentricity due to the
emission of GWs occurs on a timescale much longer than the orbital timescale. This
allows us to average the eccentricity over the orbital period and to track its variation
only from one orbit to the next, computing thus the orbit-averaged version of the
evolution equation for the eccentricity. As a note of caution, this approximation
breaks down in the late inspiral of the binary, when the orbit becomes quasi-circular
and the orbital velocity approaches the speed of light. In this region, starting roughly
around v ≈ 0.25c, the emission of GWs forces the orbit to decay faster and to
circularize under the eﬀect of radiation-reaction [66]. As long as the inspiral does not
reach this region, the orbit decays slowly enough for the motion within one orbit to be
conservative, keeping the adiabatic approximation valid with high degree of accuracy.
What happens thought when the eccentricity decreases in time due to the emission of
GWs, while the orbital velocity increases? This is the two-body problem in GR, which
does not have an analytic solution. Nevertheless, we can generalize the solution to
Kepler’s equation to include these relativistic eﬀects, following [58].

where et is the time-dependent eccentricity, Ji are again the modiﬁed Bessel functions,
and αj are the perturbative, post-Newtonian corrections, that depend on et, on the
parameter xP N , as well as on the chosen coordinate system. This slightly perturbed
form of Kepler’s equation (7) can still accurately describe the orbital evolution in GR.

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

8

This formalism is called the quasi-Keplerian parametrization and comes at a price,
namely we must take into account three eccentricity parameters to include the three
important changes in the orbit introduced in GR, namely: (1) et for the change in the
orbital period due to the emission of GW, (2) eθ for the relativistic precession of
periastron and (3) er for the shrinking of the orbit [67, 68, 69]. These eccentricities
depend all on the energy and angular momentum of the binary and thus on each
other, allowing us to choose in our calculation only one of them, namely et, as is
customary in the literature [11]. Finding analytic solutions to the quasi-Keplerian
equation is, as expected, much more complicated now, but it has been achieved up to
3PN order in accuracy [58, 70, 71, 72].

2.3. The Inspiral Waveform

Up to this point, we described in detail the motion of the binary in the weak-ﬁeld
region. Armed with this knowledge, we can turn now to our main objective, namely to
calculate the analytical form of the emitted GW. We will start with the formula for
the dimensionless strain,

h(t) = h+(t) − ih×(t) = A(t)e−iφGW (t),

(9)

where the two strain components (h+(t), h×(t)) describe the two possible polarizations
of the wave, φGW (t) is the phase of the GW and A(t) is its complex amplitude. At the
optimal orientation, namely when the binary is face-on and right overhead the
detector, and at a distance R from it, the amplitude of GW is maximum, and is given
by [54]:

A(t) = AR(t) + iAI(t)

(10)

GWs are quadrupolar due to the law of conservation of linear and angular momentum,
such that the signal goes through maxima and minima twice during one orbital cycle,
thus: φGW (t) = 2φ(t). The strain from eq.(9) is usually decomposed in spin-weighted
(s = −2) spherical harmonics modes (l, m) [73],

observer are θ = ϕ = 0) [74].
To calculate the strain in eq.(9) we need to know the equations of motion for the
orbital phase φ(t) and the orbital separation r(t). In the PN approximation those
quantities are written as powers of the small parameter xP N (t), as shown below:

rP N (t) =

(13)

Here N is the order of the post-Newtonian expansion and the terms (ρjP N , ϕjP N ) are
numerical expansion coeﬃcients. To calculate those expressions we need to know how
xP N (t) evolves in time, as given by the balance equation (6). There are several ways of
further expanding this equation in post-Newtonian powers of xP N (t), and we will
choose the TaylorT4 approximant [75], which gives for xP N (t) the equation [56]:

˙xP N (t) =

Note that ˙xHT (t) are called hereditary terms and enter in the equation as fractional
j/2 PN corrections [76]. Those terms describe the nonlinear interaction of the GWs
propagating away from the sources at a later time with the GWs that propagated
towards the source at an earlier time (memory eﬀects) and again back-scattered by the
spacetime curvature of the binary (tail eﬀects). Those hereditary terms, containing
both memory and tail eﬀects, depend on all the past dynamical history of the source
(see [33, 51] for details).
We must add to eq.(14) the following equation of motion for the eccentricity, because
the eccentricity diminishes as the orbit circularizes while the binary inspirals emitting
GW as it approaches the merger,

Next, we ﬁnd the evolution of the mean anomaly (cid:96) that describes how the orbital
angular velocity changes in the course of an orbital evolution due to the eccentricity.

(16)

After we know how the key quantities eP N (t), xP N (t) and lP N (t) evolve in time, we
must solve the quasi-Keplerian equation (7) to ﬁnd the eccentric anomaly uP N . The
last two steps, before obtaining the strain in eq.(9), are to integrate equation (13) to
ﬁnd the orbital phase φ(t), and to calculate the separation r(t) with equation (12).

3. Theoretical Framework: the Strong-Field Region

3.1. Location, Location, Location

Let us now attempt to tackle the problem of the binary motion when the orbital
velocity approaches the speed of light and the PN formalism can no longer be applied.
Going beyond this approximation brings us up against the strong gravitational ﬁeld
region, which can be described accurately only by Einstein equations of GR that
connect the gravitational ﬁeld with the geometry of spacetime through the curvature.

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

10

The transition between the weak and strong ﬁeld starts at the last stable orbit a
particle would have when moving around the central black hole, called the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO). This is well deﬁned only for a small point-like body
orbiting a much more massive one, and becomes increasingly less delimited as the
masses of the two bodies are comparable [77]. We will stay within the one-body
problem model considered before, in which a particle of mass µ is orbits a central
black hole of mass M , only this time we will extend the size of the central body from a
material point to a static Schwarzschild black hole of radius rSch (the Schwarzschild
radius). In this case, it is analytically proved that ISCO is located at rISCO = 6M or
3rSch in geometrical units [78]. If the central black hole is spinning though, ISCO will
move closer or further away from this position, depending on the direction of the
particle’s orbit relative to the black hole’s spin. The analytical expression for the
dimensionless radius of the last stable prograde orbit is given below [79, 80].

spin of the ﬁnal black hole.
Beyond ISCO we enter the plunge region, which ends at the light ring (LR) – the last
stable photon orbit. The LR is located at rLR = 1.5rSch = 3M and changes if the
black hole is spinning, depending on the orbit of the photon with respect to its spin.
Its location, calculated analytically in [79, 81] for a rotating black hole, plays an
important role in the matching procedure, and for the prograde orbit is given by:

(cid:19)(cid:21)

(18)

where χf is the ﬁnal spin. After the LR, the coalescence (or merger ) begins, during
which the two black holes come in contact and collide, forming a highly distorted
common envelope, called apparent horizon (AH) [82, 83]. This is a third dimensional
surface, locally deﬁned as the place where the photons directed outward from the
interior region cannot escape to the exterior. The AH coincides with the boundary of
the black hole, namely the event horizon (EH), only for static black holes rEH = 2M .
This is because the EH is a four dimensional surface in GR and it’s clear location can
be calculated only at the end of all times. In dynamical spacetimes the EH is
approximated with the AH, which is used to mark the surface of the distorted black
hole formed by collision [84]. The general expression for the radius of the outer event
horizon of a rotating (Kerr) black hole is:

rAH = r+ = M (1 +

(cid:113)

f ).

(19)

After the merger, we must switch models from the one-body problem, to the close
limit approximation (CLA) [85]. This is an analytical approach that uses the
perturbation theory to analyze how a highly perturbed Schwarzschild black hole rings
down the remaining energy in form of GWs and becomes quiescent [86, 87]. The
amplitude of the emitted GWs increases between the ISCO and the LR, reaches the

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

11

peak amplitude (or chirp) around the AH, and diminishes in the ringdown phase,
while the frequency increases monotonically.
We separate thus the strong ﬁeld in three regions: plunge, merger and ring down,
delimited by three locations: rISCO (17), rLR (18), and rAH (18). These locations enter
in the analytical calculation of the GWs emitted in the strong ﬁeld region and play a
key role in determining the optimal place where we should glue together the weak and
strong ﬁeld waveforms.
As a side note, it is worth mentioning that several authors [80, 45, 42] replace the
location of the LR with the position of the minimal energy circular orbit (MECO).
This is based on the observation that no constraining connection exists between the
LR, which marks a peak in the eﬀective radial potential, and the dynamics of the
spacetime during the collision, which is governed by the curvature potential, as is
argued in [88]. However, in the same paper it is pointed out that those two locations
are close enough to each other that the wavelength of the GW is insensitive to such
small variation in the position of the peak. We will consider in this work that the LR
is an accurate approximation for the peak of the curvature potential.

3.2. The Merger Waveform

For the merger, we employ the Backward-one-Body (BoB) model, introduced in [93],
that calculates the strain of the GWs using the formula:

hBoB(t) =

A(t)
Ω2(t)

e−iφBoB(t)

where the amplitude has the form:
(cid:32) t − t0
τQN M

A(t) = A0sech

(cid:33)

(20)

(21)

Here A0 is an integration constant that enters as a scaling factor, t0 is the time at
which the strain of the GW reaches its peak amplitude, and τQN M is the damping time
necessary for the ﬁnal black hole to settle down after the collision. During this time,
the highly perturbed remnant object releases its energy in GWs as characteristic
exponentially damped quasi-normal modes (QNM). We can ﬁnd the damping time
using the deﬁnition [92]:

τQN M = 2

QQN M
ΩQN M

.

(22)

where the quality factor QQN M is a dimensionless quantity measuring the number of
oscillations observed before a mode gets attenuated by a factor of e2π [90], and ΩQN M
is the QNM frequency. Whatever initial data we provide inside the r < 3M region
where the peak of the potential barrier is located, this barrier will ﬁlter it, and an
outside observer will detect only the QNM ringing. We employ the following
polynomial ﬁt for the pair (ΩQN M , QQN M ):
Mf ΩQN M = f1 + f2(1 − χf )f3,

(23)

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

QQN M = q1 + q2(1 − χf )q3

with the set of coeﬃcients f1,2,3 and q1,2,3 given in [49].
The phase in eq.(20) is obtained by integrating the frequency Ω(t):

ΦBoB(t) =

(cid:90)

which is given in this model by the equation:

The initial frequency Ωi corresponds to the frequency at the end of the inspiral, around

the initial time ti, which is analytically obtained by replacing eq.(27) in eq.(26):

4. Results: Building the Compete Waveform

4.1. It’s about time

Before we turn all this formalism into concrete waveforms, let us take a better look at
the independent variable dictating the evolution of the whole system, namely the time
coordinate, which is taken to coincide with the proper time of distant observers.
Let’s start with the expression given in [7] for the coalescence time until a binary in
quasi-circular orbit reaches the merger, from a known initial separation or semi-major
axis r0, due to the emission of GW. In geometrical units, this formula is

Tc =

where q = m1/m2 is the mass ratio of the binary. The addition of a small initial
eccentricity e0 is accounted for by replacing r0 in eq.(29) with
8.70127(1 − e2
0)
0)870/229 .

a0 = r0

(29)

(30)

Recently, improved estimations of this time, including 1st order PN perturbations,
were given in [94, 95]. The choice of the initial separation a0 is limited by the low
frequency cutoﬀ of Earth’s seismic activity flow, which dictates the threshold value for
the advanced LIGO GW detection band. For a cutoﬀ frequency flow = 10 Hz, we
obtain from Kepler’s third law a0 = (M/π2f 2

low)1/3. For an equal mass binary of total

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

13

mass M = 50M(cid:12), this amounts to a separation of about 1278M(cid:12) = 1888 km, and gives
a coalescence time Tc = 8.22 s of the GW signal in the aLIGO band. The coalescence
time decreases for eccentric binaries, thus if we assume for example that the binary
enters the aLIGO band with e0 = 0.25, it will take Tc = 6.11 s to collide, which will be
enough time for the eccentricity to be detected. The LISA band cutoﬀ frequency
however is much lower, flow,LISA = 10−4 Hz, which, for a 50M(cid:12) equal-mass binary gives
a separation of 4 × 106 km, and consequently a collision time of about ﬁve millions
years. Thus systems with large eccentricities are expected to be regularly detected by
space-borne instruments. Conversely, GW signals lasting only a few seconds in the
LISA band will come from billions solar masses binaries.
The issue we must tackle next is to ﬁnd an appropriate estimate for the time when the
inspiral model breaks down and must be replaced with the merger model. As we
mentioned before, the transition between the weak and strong regime happens around
the last stable orbit (ISCO), located around rISCO = 6M . The problem with the start
of the merger phase at ISCO is, as we explained previously in Sec.3.1, that ISCO is
not well deﬁned for comparable mass binaries. Fortunately, we can still deﬁne an
approximate ISCO even in this case, closer to the light-ring, given in eq.(18), which in
the non-spinning case (χf = 0) is rLR = 4M [44]. Using eq.(29) for r0 = rLR = 4M , we
get t = 20M , which corresponds to the initial time ti for the strong region. Here, in
the 0th PN approximation, the orbital frequency will be M ωLR = 0.125, which
represents a lower limit for the orbital frequency of the inspiral model predicted by the
PN theory around tLR. Another constraint, oﬀered by eq.(28), provides a third
independent check for the relationship between this time and the frequency at which
the merger waveform joins smoothly with the inspiral. The reader is warned that some
arbitrariness will be still inherent due to the assumptions we will make, because there
is no unique way of deﬁning this transition time unambiguously.
Lastly, we will choose the time at which the amplitude of the fundamental mode has a
maximum, as the origin of the time axis t0 = 0.

4.2. Eccentric Slowness

Our procedure for the implementation of the inspiral waveform follows the outline
given in Sec.2.3. First, we implement all the expressions for the coeﬃcients that
appear in equations (12), (13), (14), (15) and (16). Those coeﬃcients are currently
known up to the 4th leading PN order, with up to 6PN quasi-circular correction terms
and hereditary corrections [96, 97, 98, 34]. Impressive eﬀorts are continuously made to
calculate new terms in the PN expansion [99, 100, 101, 102, 103]. Following [76], we
include up to 6PN self-force and hereditary correction terms, to increase the accuracy
in modeling the region near the merger. We use NDSolve [104] within the Wolfram
Mathematica symbolic computation program [105] to solve the coupled equations of
motion (14) and (15), with the χjP N terms as in [76] and the eccentricity coeﬃcients
(cid:15)jP N from [74, 106]. We start from the aLIGO cutoﬀ frequency flow, work with 20

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

14

precision digits and pick the time Ts when the equations become stiﬀ and fail to yield
a solution as the approximate collision time, then mark tLR = Ts − 20M as the end of
the weak ﬁeld region.
Let’s look now at the predicted evolution of the eccentricity, for an equal mass binary
of 50M(cid:12) total mass and three values for the eccentricity: e0 = 0.5, 0.25, 0.1 at flow. We
choose the highest eccentricity to be e0 = 0.5 because is close to the average
eccentricity for wide binaries [107]. Fig.2 shows that collisions of highly eccentric
binaries happen faster, thus we expect a higher number of GW detections to come
from initially highly eccentric systems.

Figure 2. Time evolution of the eccentricity, for an equal mass binary of 50M(cid:12) (the
time is measured in units of mass, 1M = 4.92674 × 10−6s).

Fig. 3, shows the eﬀect of the mass ratio on the eccentricity evolution, starting from
e0 = 0.25 eccentricity at cutoﬀ frequency, for a 50M(cid:12) mass binary with three mass
ratios q = 4, 2, 1. We see that small-mass ratio binaries take less time to merge than
high-mass ratio ones, which has the expected consequence that more GW signals will
come from equal or nearly equal mass binaries.
As expected, the evolution of the eccentricity depends also on the method used. Fig. 4
shows that taking into account the hereditary terms is important, because they add
the fractional n/2 powers and cancel out terms depending on the chosen system of
coordinates, thus ensuring the gauge-invariance of the equations [76].
In Table 1 we give the values for the eccentricity, slowness, and orbital frequency at
the LR for an equal-mass binary with total mass 50M, starting from three diﬀerent
eccentricities, as well as a comparison between the numerical value of the collision time

obtained when the equations become stiﬀ Ts and the collision time Tc predicted by
eq.(29). The slowness reaches a constant value at the LR (xLR ≈ 0.178), while the

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

16

eccentricity decreases dramatically, more than 15 times near LR, which proves that by
the beginning of the strong ﬁeld region the orbit of the system is circularized, even for
large initial eccentricity, which can happen for capture binaries in dense clusters [108].
It is reassuring that the eccentricity becomes close enough to zero by the time we reach
the strong-ﬁeld region, because the merger model is built for quasi-circular binaries.

˙φP N (t) = ωP N (t) = M −1x3/2

In a previous work [109] we implemented an analytical calculation of GW from
quasi-circular binaries up to the 3.5P N order, ﬁrst by solving only eq.(14), then by
relying on Kepler’s third law to obtain the phase as:
The addition of the eccentricity complicates things by introducing the angular
anomaly which requires solving the transcendental Kepler’s equation.
The orbital angular velocity is now represented by the mean motion w, which changes
in the course of an orbital evolution due to the presence of the eccentricity and is
described by eq.(16). To ﬁnd the evolution of the mean anomaly l(t) we integrate this
equation with the λjP N coeﬃcients from [74]. With this quantity in hand, we proceed
to calculating the eccentric anomaly given in eq.(7), with the 3PN coeﬃcients αj
entering in the term Ai taken from [58] for the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)
coordinates. The evaluation of the Bessel functions is computationally expensive and
in order to speed up the calculation we devised a method detailed in [110]. In here, we
increase the truncation of the sum in the Bessel functions to 10, tabulate u(t), then
apply a high order interpolating polynomial to keep the error around 10−20 precision.
With the hardest part of the implementation out of our way, the next two steps are to
calculate the orbital separation r(t) given by eq.(12) and the derivative of the phase as
in eq.(13), with the coeﬃcients ρjP N and φjP N from [74]. In order to keep the desired
precision and speed up the calculation, before we evaluate the time derivative of the
separation, we use the same procedure of ﬁtting a high-order polynomial to r(t).
Lastly, we solve for the phase φ(t) and build the strain with eq.(9). We use the
following formulas for the polarizations of the strain for optimal orientation of the
observer [109]:

h+(t) = −2

Those expressions can be extended to take into account the orientation of the binary
with respect to the detector by performing three consecutive rotations from the frame
of the orbit {x, y, z} onto the frame of the observer {X, Y, Z} = P {x, y, z}, where P is
the rotation matrix written function of the three Euler angles, namely the longitude of
the ascending node ψ, the inclination ι and the argument of the pericenter ν, as
described in [62]. In this case, the true anomaly must be corrected to: φ → Φ = φ − ν.
We assume an optimal orientation of the detector and leave the inclusion of arbitrary
orientation for a future work.
We build our implementation hierarchically, constructing ﬁrst the 2PN corrections,
then adding the 3PN terms, and lastly the hereditary term ˙xHT , while carefully testing
our results against the zero eccentricity limit using the ﬁrst GW detected signal
GW150914 as a sanity check (as detailed in [110]). The addition of the higher order
hereditary corrections is necessary because, besides adding accuracy, it extends the
validity of the inspiral model closer to the merger, increasing the overlap region with
the merger model.
We show in Figures 5 and 6 the amplitude and the argument of the strain for optimal
orientation of the observer. It is clear again, from Fig.5, that the eccentricity plays a
vital role in determining the strength and duration of the signal, because highly
eccentric system are more energetic but much shorter. In Fig.6 we plot the argument
of the strain, which in absolute value is equal to twice the orbital phase φ. We see that
both the amplitude and the argument (phase) exhibit oscillations that diminish with
the decrease of the eccentricity, until the orbit becomes quasi-circular near the merger.

4.4. Prepare to Merge

Before we proceed to model the merger part of the GW strain, we must know ﬁrst the
mass, spin and ring-down frequency of the ﬁnal black hole, required by the BoB model
as initial data. For the building of the inspiral strain we have not taken this spin into
account because we treated the black holes as particles. Once the separation becomes
comparable to the LR radius, we cannot ignore the spin any longer. If the spins are
equal and antiparallel, or the black holes don’t spin, then the ﬁnal spin is χ0 = 0.686.
In this case eq.(18) shows that the location of the LR will move to about
rLR,χ0 = 2.04M , and the position of the apparent horizon, given by eq.(19), will be
around rAH,χ0 = 1.73M .
With the ﬁnal spin known, we proceed next to calculate the mass loss to GW energy,
which subtracted from the total mass gives the mass of the ﬁnal black hole. A simple

The last essential ingredients we must add to the initial data for the merger model is
the knowledge of fundamental QNM frequency ΩQN M of the remnant black hole and
the quality factor QQN M , which is necessary to calculate the damping time describing
the decay in the amplitude of the GW. For this we eq.(23), (24) with the set of
coeﬃcients for the dominant mode taken from [112]:

f1 = 1, f2 = −0.63, f3 = 0.3, g1 = 0, g2 = 2, g3 = −0.45..

(34)

The damping time of the fundamental mode is given by eq.(22).
We calculate the ﬁnal mass Mf , the dominant (l = m = 2) mode of the resonant
frequency ωQN M , the corresponding quality factor QQN M and the damping time τ for
three non-spinning binary systems with mass rations q = 1, 2, 4 and give the values in
Table 2. We add to this table the PN values for Ωi and its time derivative ˙Ωi,
calculated in the inspiral model at the light ring.

The BoB model (as emphasized in [93]) does not depend directly on any other
numerically ﬁtted coeﬃcients. We start building it now, by calculating the angular
frequency of the fundamental mode using eq.(26), with κ given by eq.(27) and ti from
eq.(28), then we obtain the dominant mode by multiplying it with m = 2. Once the
frequency is known, we calculate the amplitude, given by eq.(21). We proceed next to
calculate the phase, given by eq.(25). Lastly, we implement the strain, given by (20).
We remind the reader that we assumed the black holes entering the merger do not
spin, or their eﬀective spin is zero, and indeed this is a good approximation for most of
the binaries detected in the LIGO and Virgo O1–O3 observing runs [4].

4.5. Fasten It Tight

It is due time now to attach the GW template for the inspiral to the one obtained
with the BoB mode and to construct a completely analytical GW template that
encompasses the whole evolution of the BBH collision, from the time it enters the
detection band untill the quiescence of the ﬁnal BH.
We use an equal-mass binary of normalized mass m1 + m2 = 1M(cid:12) and start the
inspiral at a separation r0 = 10M , but those assumptions can be easily modiﬁed to ﬁt
any separation, and rescaled to a desired total mass of the BBH system, as well as
mass ratio up to q = 10. For the initial eccentricity we will consider two values,
ei,1 = 10−3 corresponding to the quasi-circular case, and an eccentric close orbit of

Analytic Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes in Elliptic Orbits

20

ei,2 = 0.15. With this initial data we run the PN portion of the binary evolution. The
quasi-circular case evolves up to Ts,1 = 530M , its eccentricity drops to
ef,1 = 1.7 × 10−4 and its orbital frequency reaches Ωf,1 = 0.13407. We take the initial
frequency for the BoB model at tLR,1 = Ts,1 − 20M corresponding to the location of
the LR, where the PN approximation breaks. The value of this frequency, taken
directly from the PN data, is Ωi,1 = 7.4085 × 10−2. The large eccentricity case has a
shorter span, only up to Ts,2 = 460M , its eccentricity drops to ef,2 = 1.988 × 10−2 and
its orbital frequency raises to Ωf,2 = 0.19466. Even for this case, the initial frequency
for the BoB model at tLR,2 = Tf,2 − 20M is Ωi,2 = 7.5837 × 10−2, which is close to the
values found in table 1. Note that the orbital frequency at the LR stays ≈ 0.075 with
a mean deviation of ≈ 10−4, marking the transition from the weak (far ﬁeld) to the
strong (near ﬁeld) zone where the reduced wavelength of the gravitational wave
¯λGW = Ω−1 becomes comparable to the binary separation r.
Save for the slight diﬀerence in the initial frequency, we start the BoB model with the
same values for the ringdown frequency and quality factor. We perform the stitching
in frequency at the initial time calculated in eq.(28) ti for the BoB model.
We create the hybrid frequency with the formula:

ωhyb(t) = (1 − σ(t))ωP N (t − ti) + σ(t)ωBoB(t).

where σ(t) is the piecewise function:

σ(t) =

(cid:40) 0 t ≤ ti
1 t > ti

(35)

(36)

We obtain an excellent overlap at and around ti, as shown in Fig.7, without
introducing any other time shift. Even the high-eccentricity case, as shown in Fig.8,
exhibits this excellent behavior at the chosen matching time. We drastically reduced
the ambiguity in time for the matching in frequency, which is a remarkable result.
Before stitching together the strain, we normalize the BoB amplitude and rescale the
amplitude of the inspiral with this normalized amplitude divided by the PN amplitude
at the light ring tLR.
We form the hybrid strain with the same technique, this time translating also the BoB
strain with the peak time of increase in frequency tf and correcting it for sign, which
indicates a phase diﬀerence of π/2. We note that this does not introduce a shift
ambiguity because the two models might not to use the same sign convention. The
formula for the normalized hybrid strain is:

¯hhyb(t) = (1 − σ(t))¯hP N (t − ti) − σ(t)¯hBoB(t + tp).

(37)

For the low-eccentricity case this provides again an excellent overlap at and around ti,
as seen in Fig.9. When matching the high-eccentricity inspiral with the BoB merger
strain we encounter a slight mismatch, both in amplitude and time of the matching.
This is most likely due to the fact that the orbit is not fully circularized by the time
the binary enters the strong-ﬁeld zone, and the BoB model does not take into account
the eccentricity. We mitigate residual eﬀects or the eccentricity by matching the two

strains at the closest peak in their amplitude near ti and rescaling slightly the inspiral
strain to match the amplitude of the BoB at that time. The result is shown in Fig.10.

high-eccentricities, which can be mitigated in further studies.

5. Conclusions

In this work we implemented a purely analytical framework for obtaining complete
GW templates from eccentric binary sources and produced a set of new, freely
available Wolfram Mathematica notebooks. First, we gathered and assembled into a
coherent way all the pieces of the puzzle required to ensure the accurate
implementation. We started with an exposition of the essential theoretical framework,
by introducing the speciﬁc terminology and by giving clear explanations to prevent
confusing readers with diﬀerent scientiﬁc background. We carefully chose, from the
rich scientiﬁc literature, a fully analytical procedure to build the inspiral GW that
contains high-order PN corrections for enhanced accuracy. For the eccentricity and
slowness we employ instantaneous and hereditary coeﬃcients with energy corrections
up to 6PN. We implemented a purely analytical expression for the solution to Kepler’s
equation that gives the eccentric anomaly, accurate up to 3PN order. We calculated
the orbital separation and the phase, keeping the errors below machine precision, and
used high order interpolating polynomials when necessary to speed up the calculation.
We assembled the strain and displayed its dependence on eccentricity and mass ratio,
showing that we expect a higher number of GW detections from eccentric comparable
mass ratios binaries, which emphasizes the relevance of modeling such systems. For the
merger, we implemented the purely analytical BoB model for the merger, which relies
on the quasi-circular assumption. At last, we glued together the eccentric inspiral and
the quasi-circular merger waveforms by completing them in frequency, amplitude and
phase with a piecewise function, building the hybrid GW strain for the whole
evolution of the binary. Remarkably, for low eccentricity, the match between the BoB
and PN approximations are on-point, with coincidence in the overlap, which indicates
no ambiguity in the time interval, a great improvement from the usual matching
techniques. For high-eccentricity we must make a slight adjustment, both in time and
amplitude, to compensate for the implicit quasi-circular assumption built into the BoB
approach, but the matching in frequency and phase are again unambiguous.
The new open-source tool for the calculation of analytic GW templates for eccentric
binaries, together with the thorough and streamlined documentation of our steps given
in this paper, oﬀers researchers in the ﬁeld of gravitational waves a straightforward
path to understand, reproduce, use and extend our implementation. Future
developments will incorporate higher PN orders, will include spin, precession and
kicks, and might augment the BoB model to account for eccentricity close to the
merger. Our notebooks are available at github.com/mbabiuc/MathScripts.
