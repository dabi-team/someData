An Empirical Study on How Well Do COVID-19
Information Dashboards Service Users’
Information Needs

Xinyan Li, Han Wang, Chunyang Chen, and John Grundy

Abstract—The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of dashboards for providing critical real-time information. In
order to enable people to obtain information in time and to understand complex statistical data, many developers have designed and
implemented public-oriented COVID-19 “information dashboards” during the pandemic. However, development often takes a long time
and developers are not clear about many people’s information needs, resulting in gaps between information needs and supplies.
According to our empirical study and observations with popular developed COVID-19 dashboards, this seriously impedes information
acquirement. Our study compares people’s needs on Twitter with existing information suppliers. We determine that despite the
COVID-19 information that is currently on existing dashboards, people are also interested in the relationship between COVID-19 and
other viruses, the origin of COVID-19, vaccine development, fake new about COVID-19, impact on women, impact on school/university,
and impact on business. Most of these have not yet been well addressed. We also summarise the visualization and interaction patterns
commonly applied in dashboards, ﬁnding key patterns between data and visualization as well as visualization and interaction. Our
ﬁndings can help developers to better optimize their dashboard to meet people’s needs and make improvements to future crisis
management dashboard development.

1 INTRODUCTION

C ORONAVIRUS disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] is an in-

fectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since its ﬁrst being
reported in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread quickly
around the world, and becomes a global pandemic. There
were more than 195 million conﬁrmed cases and over 4
million lives lost by far. Governments from different coun-
tries and states have taken actions to try to avoid the
transmissions such as lockdown, border closure, claim social
distance. And human lives have been severely impacted due
to the pandemic. People are in desperate need of the latest
information such as policies, and the states in their local area
from many different sources, i.e. social media, informative
dashboards, government releases, TV, newspaper.

However, current information sources have a number of
problems when providing COVID-19 information web ser-
vices. First, the information from government or traditional
media (i.e., TV and newspaper) is not frequently updated.
Second, different layers of the government (state and federal
government) may provide contradictory information. Also,
there are also many rumors spread on social media [2],
which makes it difﬁcult for people to know who and what
to trust. Finally, the current information about COVID-19
is fragmented. It takes effort for people to aggregate the
information they need to see from different places.

A dashboard is a visual display of the most important
information needed to achieve one or more objectives [3].
Information is typically consolidated and arranged on a
single screen to be monitored at a glance. COVID-19 dash-
boards have emerged for collecting COVID-19 information
in a one-stop sharing site and providing services to address
the problems we discussed above. They offer real-time
statistics about different aspects of the COVID-19 virus, use
different visualizations to help understand the trends of
the pandemic, compare situations in different regions, and
acknowledge users areas that are being severely infected.

Since these dashboards are hosted online, developers
are able to update them multiple times per day to serve
the latest data to public once they are available. They have
good mobility as people can access it anytime at anywhere.
Some of them allow users to subscribe for the latest updates.
Unlike social media forums where everyone can post, dash-
boards are only maintained by the developers, so the chance
of encountering confused data or rumors is reduced.

There are some works related to dashboard develop-
ment [3], [4]. However, no previous works provide com-
prehensive instructions on building dashboards for crisis
events. Aside from basic stats (i.e., conﬁrmed case, death),
different dashboard websites have various types of data.
Moreover, even for the same type of data, there are different
approaches to visualize them. Some of the visualizations are
useful whereas some are irresponsible use of visualization
that may cause public fear, for example using sensationalist
colours in the maps [5]. It is unclear what types of data that
dashboard users want to learn about the most, and what is a
proper way to visualize the pandemic data so that the public
can better understanding the situation. To address this, we

carried out an empirical study of COVID-19 information
dashboards with the aim of forming a more systematic
way of building such dashboards for crisis events to serve
the public needs. We propose four research questions and
summarize the questions and ﬁndings. We analyze tweets
related to the COVID-19 topics, compare features of various
COVID-19 dashboards, and build a knowledge taxonomy.
We further discuss the implications that we ﬁnd during
the research. We hope that this work can help the current
COVID-19 information dashboard provide a better web
service to the public and be helpful for the development
of a similar crisis event dashboard in the future.
The key contributions of this work include:

• This is the ﬁrst empirical study on information dash-
boards that focuses on serving the information needs
for the COVID-19 pandemic.

• By comparing the information requirements from
social media and the contents from existing COVID-
19 dashboards, we ﬁnd gaps between the current
information dashboards and the public’s needs. We
identify two critical themes of information that peo-
ple frequently ask about on social media but do not
appear on dashboards.

• By analysing real users’ feedback about COVID-19
dashboards on Twitter, we identify the pros and
cons of different dashboards and analyze the reasons
behind these.

• We discuss lessons learnt from different visualiza-
tions on dashboards that could be adopted for
rapidly developing other emergency information
dashboards in the future.

We ﬁrst discuss the motivation of this research and spec-
ify its three key research questions (RQ) (Section 2). We then
describe the method for data collection and analysis (Section
3). We illustrate the approach and results we have obtained
for each RQ (Sections 4-7). The discussion of results is
discussed (Section 8) followed by threats to validity (Section
9) and key related works (Section 10). We conclude the paper
and discuss possible future works (Section 11).

2 MOTIVATION

A large number of COVID-19 information dashboards have
been published to serve the public information needs. For
instance, the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dash-
board has become an essential resource for tracking the
scope and scale of the pandemic, not just for media outlets
but also for clinicians and government ofﬁcials [6]. DingXi-
angYuan (DXY), a Chinese organization, builds a dashboard
to track the COVID-19 virus in China and has more than 4
billion visits across the world. We have summarised some
of the more popular COVID-19 dashboard websites in Fig 1.
Among them, the COVIDAu dashboard is developed by the
authors of this paper. Our dashboard primarily focuses on
the pandemic in Australia, and its purpose is to keep the
Australians informed about the latest government-provided
information. We also include the 1point3acres dashboard,
which is built to serve the U.S. and Canada users, and the
World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dashboard,
which is used to report global pandemic trends.

Despite the high volume of visits to these dashboards,
we found some questions during the usage and develop-
ment. For instance, during our development of the COVI-
DAu dashboard, we received many requests for different
types of data and visualizations, e.g.,“Also, can you also show
the cases summary per suburb.” and “Are you able to show #
of tests per day conducted (preferably per state) in the historical
section?”. This makes us wonder what information people
want to know that hasn’t yet been put into the dashboard.
When looking at COVID-19 dashboards, we ﬁnd that basic
data like total cases or death numbers are developed with
different visualizations. For instance, one dashboard uses
both line charts and histograms on total cases data, whereas
another dashboard applies map visualization on the same
type of data. As there is no such pandemic like the COVID-
19 that makes such enormous impacts globally, no related
works have been found on how to improve information
services on these pandemic dashboards.

2.1 Research Questions

To present data that meets public information needs and
improves the current COVID-19 dashboards, we explore

their information needs and existing information supply
by carrying out an empirical study of multiple COVID-19
dashboards. Developers can use the ﬁndings to improve
these dashboards further and prepare the community for
the next potential pandemic. Below we present and discuss
the key research questions this study attempts to answer.
We discuss why we raise the questions, our plan to answer
them, and the beneﬁts of answering each of the questions.

RQ1. What are people’s information needs about
COVID-19?

The use of dashboards has become popular and they
have been applied in many situations, such as tracking
disease spreading or the changing in business market [7].
Given that the COVID-19 virus spreads rapidly and peo-
ple want to know the latest status, we propose making a
dashboard that provides real-time COVID-19 information
would needs to collect the information that the masses want.
However, traditional requirements collection methods such
as surveys are too cumbersome [8]. After investigation, we
notice that people are very enthusiastic about discussing
the COVID-19 on Twitter [9]. We therefore, use automated
data analysis to analyze a number of tweets to get people’s
views on their COVID-19 pandemic information needs. RQ1
aims to extract information that people desire to know
based on collecting COVID-19 related inquires on Twitter.
We use topic modeling to extract topics of information, as
this avoids duplication of data.

RQ2. What are the information supplies from exist-
ing COVID-19 information dashboards?

The dashboard is a common and popular information
management tool that is often used to track and visualize
major public events and communicate important informa-
tion at a glance [10]. Since the COVID-19 coronavirus was
discovered, many dashboards have been developed, includ-
ing the dashboard developed by the authors. Nevertheless,
there has no research summary of the information in the
existing dashboards. Hence, we propose our second re-
search question to explore this ﬁeld. Comparing the ﬁndings
from RQ1 and RQ2 can reveal the gap between existing
information supply and people’s expressed requirements.

RQ3. How should COVID-19 related information be
better visualized?

Visualization and interaction are essential for informa-
tion exploration in dashboards. Previous research has dis-
cussed data type taxonomies for information visualization,
and discovered that a successful commercial product has
multiple data types [11]. Still, there is no research focusing
on the information visualization needs and approaches for
COVID-19 data. Hence, we raise the RQ3 to analyze data
visualizations. By summarising the visualization and inter-
actions on the existing COVID-19 dashboards, RQ3 provides
a guideline for further emergency information dashboard
development, particularly for dashboard developers.

RQ4. What are users’ views on current COVID-19
Dashboards?

3

The purpose of developing a COVID-19 dashboard is to
help people understand the epidemic information quickly
and efﬁciently. Therefore, users’ comments can be very
important for developers to improve the dashboard services
in future development. We proposed the RQ4 to study
users’ comments on COVID-19 dashboards. By exploring
users’ comments on Twitter, we summarised the positive
and negative comments. Besides, we also discuss possible
reasons that caused the negative comments.

3 METHOD

We adopt a mixed-methods approach by conducting Twitter
information collection and existing COVID-19 dashboard
analysis. The following section discusses how we retrieve
data from Twitter and the methods we chose to attempt to
answer each research question.

3.1 Data Collection

We collected tweets with COVID-19 related hashtags from
22nd March to 10th June 2020 to try to analyze users’ ex-
pressed COVID-19 information needs. In total, we collected
56M tweets by applying an advanced search for speciﬁc
COVID-19 hashtags. Some of the hashtags are from Breslin
et al. [12] and our research team summarized the others. All
of them are related to #COVID-19. In detail, we have col-
lected 1.54M tweets with #CoronaVirusUpdate, 7.9M tweets
with the hashtag #Corona, 14.3M tweets about #Coronavirus,
2.8M tweets have #Covid hashtag, and 20.7M tweets contains
the hashtag #Covid 19. We stored the tweets in CSV ﬁles and
created a script to ﬁlter out non-English tweets. Finally, we
obtain 48M English tweets related to COVID-19 topics.

To comprehend dashboards that developers have pro-
duced, we select ﬁve dashboards, as can be seen in Table 1:
the COVIDAu dashboard, a dashboard that has been built
by the authors and focuses on COVID-19 in Australia; the
1Point3Acres dashboard, which serves the needs of people
mainly from the US; the JHU dashboard, a dashboard that
provides a live update for over 190 different countries and
areas; the DXY dashboard, one of the earliest COVID-19
dashboards; and the WHO COVID-19 dashboard. These ﬁve
dashboards are popular in their countries/regions and have
millions of visitors in total. The dashboards we selected not
just have the ones that serve for speciﬁc countries/areas
(China, North America, and Australia), but also include
ones like JHU and WHO that focus on global data.

3.2 Data Analysis

After determining the dashboards to analyze, we adopted
an open-coding method [13] to collect and integrate infor-
mation about them. Our research team divided into two
groups. Each group collected all the information displayed
on those dashboards in the form of texts or charts to help
users better understand data. The two groups marked the
unique information that only appears in one dashboard
to facilitate subsequent dashboard difference comparisons.

After that, the groups categorized the dashboard informa-
tion into different themes and compared it with people’s
needs expressed via the Twitter analysis. We also collected
visualizations and interactions from these dashboards. Two
teams manually checked the charts in each dashboard and
the interaction methods supported by those charts. After
the initial coding, the two teams met and discussed any
discrepancies and new information categories until they
reached consensus. All the information we collected on each
dashboard is stored in Google sheets1.

4 RQ1: PEOPLE’S INFORMATION NEEDS ABOUT
COVID-19

In RQ1, we summarise popular topics from Twitter to deter-
mine people’s information requirements during the COVID-
19 pandemic.

4.1 Approach

Fig. 2. Workﬂow of tweet analysis in RQ1

Fig 2 shows the overall data collection and analysis
process of RQ1. First, we use the tweepy API [14] to crawl
all Twitter data from 22nd March to 10th June 2020. We then
create functions to iterate through timelines and ﬁlter out
the ones that do not contain the hashtags we require and
all the non-English tweets. As mentioned in Section 3.1, we
select the hashtags based on Breslin et al.’s research [12] and
our observation of popular COVID-19 related hashtags.

We noticed that tweets including questions often express
users’ requirements. For example, from “Is that roughly one
in 30 of the UK population has #COVID19?”, we could observe
that people want to know the proportion of British people
diagnosed with COVID-19. Therefore, we analysed tweets
that contain questions. We applied a Multinomial Naive
Bayes classiﬁer [15] to all the tweets data. The multinomial
Naive Bayes classiﬁer is a model which focuses on building
word counts. By creating a question word set to ﬁlter tweets
involving those words and question marks, we can then tell
whether the tweets are questions or not. The model used
nps chats as training data and label two kinds of data,
which are “whQuestion” and “ynQuestion”. “whQuestion”
means questions that begin with “wh”, for example,“Why
we need masks #COVID-19?”. “ynQuestion” means questions
that can be answered by yes or no, i.e, “Is #COVID-19 conﬁrm
cases number essential for public?”.

We then apply text processing steps to all the tweets, in-
cluding removing punctuation, lower-casing all characters,
and excluding stop words. Finally, by adopting the Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [16], we extract the topic
generated by our dataset with keywords and its importance,
which name as topic contribution in Table 2.

4.2 Results

We collect 56M tweets at ﬁrst. After the initial processing
(remove duplicated tweets and non-text tweets), about 48M
tweets are remaining. Then, after ﬁltering out the non-
questioning and non-English tweets, 3.47M are remaining.
The LDA model generates 32 topics based on the remaining
tweets, and we ﬁltered and identiﬁed 21 topics associated
with their keywords, which are listed in Table 2. Finally,
according to those topics, we extract them into four themes:
COVID-19 information, protect approaches, related to soci-
ety, and associated with the business.
Theme 1: COVID-19 information
The COVID-19 information theme contains ﬁve topics.
The ﬁrst topic is the transmission of COVID-19, which has
a 0.19 topic contribution. Tweets in this topic are curious
about how the virus spreads between individuals, whether
it spreads between animals and humans, and the best way
to stop it. For example, “Are schools driving #COVID-19
transmission? What is the number?”. The second topic is the
relation with other viruses, like “Is COVID-19 has similar
threats and severity with SARS and Ebola?”. Nearly 83%(373
posts) of tweets on this topic talk about scientists’ research
on past viruses. The third topic is fake news, which is also
a hot topic in this area. In March 2020, 582 fake news have
been detected, such as researchers discovering a cure for
COVID-19 and Israel has developed a vaccine for COVID-
19 [17]. The next topic is about the origin of COVID-19,
which has 13% (783) tweets talking about it. People ask
questions such as “Where Coronavirus from?” In the last topic,
people question about cases and death numbers, 82% of
tweets mention “case number, i.e. “What is the case number
today in...”, and about 45% of posts involve “How many people
dead?...”. People question the real situation about COVID-19
to ﬁnd out if they are safe or being protected.

Theme 2: Protection approaches
The second theme contains seven topics, which contain
tweets talk about protections during the pandemic. Among
them, self-protection and vaccine development are the two
hottest topics. In this theme, 18% of tweets discuss vaccine
development like “ how will the vaccine protect us against the
disease?”. And 14% of tweets talk about self-isolation such
as “Can I stay with families during #COVID-19 self-isolation?”.
About 13% of tweets related to wear masks, and 15% of
tweets mention how to wash hands correctly. People want
to avoid exposure to the virus, and they are eager to ﬁnd a
way to protect themselves.

Theme 3: Society issues
The third theme is related to society. From the topics
we summarise, people question the aviation industry, gov-
ernment responses, policies to handling the pandemic, and
the labor market. According to Maneenop et al. [18], since
the WHO declared the global pandemic outbreak, the avi-
ation industry’s cumulative negative abnormal return rate
is 24.42% within ﬁve days. Governments announced new
policies, such as lockdown, to try and control the pandemic,
and encouraging people to stay at home and self-isolate to
avoid virus transmission. The pandemic has dramatically
affected the labor market and the unemployment rate has
increased sharply in many countries. From Bartik et al.’s
statistics [19], in the week ending 14th March 2020, there

were 250,000 initial unemployment insurance claims in the
United States, about 20% more than in the previous week.
Therefore, people question how the epidemic affects their
income and lives and ask for ways to help themselves.

Theme 4: Related with business
The last theme is about business, especially small busi-
nesses. People discuss concerns about small businesses on
Twitter because many small businesses are ﬁnancially vul-
nerable and overwhelmed during the epidemic. For ex-
ample, “What does the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (CARES) Act mean for business? #covid19 #coronavirus
#caresact #smallbusiness”. The example above asks about
laws relate to small businesses during COVID-19. From
the keywords in this theme, we can see that about 32%
of tweets included the word “support”, people question the
speciﬁc contents of ﬁnancial support. Our analyses reveal
that people, especially small business owners, questioned
the latest policies, laws, and ﬁnancial support details.

By analyzing COVID-19 related tweets, we notice
that people are concerned with daily situations (new
cases/death/total cases) related to COVID-19, the
ways to protect themselves in the pandemic, the
effect of COVID-19 to their daily life, and COVID-
19’s impact on the economic market.

5 RQ2: INFORMATION SUPPLY FROM COVID-19
INFORMATION DASHBOARD

After exploring people’s needs as expressed via Twitter
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to know what
kind of information is on the current dashboards.

5.1 Approach

Based on the approach in Section 3.1, we performed our data
collection in the following way. We analyzed the ﬁve dash-
boards in Table 1 and categorized the information they were
providing. Two groups of researchers from our team coded
dashboards independently. At ﬁrst, each group recorded all
data on dashboards and labeled them independently, such

as “total cases in Australia” and “test numbers in Boston”. Our
groups created a table2 to store all the information and cor-
responding dashboards. Then, the researchers merged the
information with the same label. For example, “conﬁrm cases
in Australia” are merged together with “conﬁrm cases in the
United States” as “conﬁrm cases in countries”. After the initial
coding, the teams met and discussed any discrepancies until
a consensus had been reached.

5.2 Results

Fig. 3. Dashboard information taxonomy

We summarise four dimensions of information: location,
human, time, and other, that are provided by the current
COVID-19 dashboards, presented in Fig 3. We illustrate our
summary of information on dashboards in Table 3. We use
fractions to indicate the proportion of the ﬁve dashboards’
information. For example, 1/5 means one of the ﬁve dash-
boards has this information. All the terms are referenced
from the COVID Tracking project [20].

Location
In the location dimension, we identiﬁed ﬁve sub-
dimensions. Most of the dashboards focus on the country
and states level. They implement data such as the total (5/5)
and active cases (3/5) in each state or province. Moreover,
there are certain features that only appear in one dashboard.
For example, the term “Asymptomatic infection cases” on the
DXY dashboard means patients with the COVID-19 in the
incubation period are currently asymptomatic as they have
no symptoms for the time being. This only shows on the
Chinese version of the DXY dashboard in Fig 4(a). The
city/postcode-level COVID-19 information (can be seen in
Fig 4(b)) from the COVIDAu dashboard, is also only identi-
ﬁed in one dashboard. This may be due to that trustworthy

DashboardLocationHumanTimeOthersCountryStateSuburbPostcodeAddressRaceGenderPopulationAge21d14d7d24hInfectionSources6

ﬁve dashboards have the total death number by 7-days and
24h (4/5). However, some dashboards also implemented
information like total cases with other periods, such as 14-
days and 21-days.

Others
The last factor is infection sources (5/5), which contains
ﬁve categories: contracted overseas, unknown community
transmission, contracted from conﬁrmed cases, contracted
interstates, and under investigation.

As shown in Table 3, it is clear that the existing dash-
boards focus on the case volumes, such as active, total, and
death cases among countries and states. We further divide
the dashboards into two groups as shown in Table 1: the
national dashboards and the global dashboards. We ﬁnd
that national dashboards like the COVIDAu and JHU dash-
boards focus on more speciﬁc information. For example,
COVIDAu provides active cases at the postcode level or
even exact address, convenient for local people to check
whether their surroundings are safe. Both of the dashboards
offer the mobility situations such as retail/recreation and
public transport change, which can observe the COVID-19
impact on economic or people’s daily life. They also pay
more attention to human-related information. Besides, na-
tional dashboards tend to use different periods like 24 hours,
7 days, and a fortnight to explore the trend of COVID-19.

For global dashboards, developers provide cases and
death tracking on a higher level: countries and states. We
take WHO dashboard as an example. Besides the country
and state level data, the WHO dashboard also provides
the relation between total cases or deaths and population.
This dashboard update cases information every 24 hours
and death data every seven days. Moreover, WHO pays
attention to infection sources as well. All of the cases have
been demonstrated how they transmit in society.

Based on the above analysis, we conclude that the global
dashboard information is broader and more comprehensive
because it is used to serve people around the world. In
contrast, a national dashboard provides more detailed in-
formation and pays more attention to exploring a speciﬁc
country or region’s epidemic data. The above phenomenon
is because the national dashboard mainly serves local peo-
ple, and they pay more attention to the situation in their
area than global information.

We determine that current COVID-19 dashboard
information focuses on the realtime situation of
COVID-19 at either country or state-level; human-
related information focuses on the distribution of
total cases by different ages; COVID-19 data for dif-
ferent periods; and the infection sources of COVID-
19.

6 RQ3: VISUALIZATION OF COVID-19 INFORMA-
TION

After analysing information in current COVID-19 informa-
tion dashboards, we noticed that different dashboards use
various ways to visualize the same data type. In RQ3, we
try to determine the different visualization approaches that
the dashboards use for same data types.

data sources in different regions only provide limited types
of data, so that it’s hard for other dashboards to add those
to their services. Besides, dashboards like the WHO dash-
board, focus on serving the global information needs the
most. They may not offer low level data to the public.

Three dashboards have test-related information on coun-
tries/states level and only one provides test location infor-
mation on states level. Therefore, we can conclude that total,
active cases, and death on countries and states level are the
essential information supplies among the ﬁve dashboards.

Human
We summarise four sub-dimensions for the human di-
mension. The ﬁrst one is population, which occurs in four
dashboards (4/5). All of them illustrate the relation between
total case number and population. For example, Fig 5(a) is
a screenshot from the WHO dashboard telling the relation
between total cases number and population. Due to the
diversity of the U.S. population, dashboard 1Point3Acres
has a chart that shows the test results by race and ethnicity
(1/5). Additionally, the dashboard COVIDAu presents the
cases by age and gender (1/5), as shown in Fig 5(b) and
Fig 5(c). We could see that population is the one that is
commonly used in all of the dashboards, whereas other
factors like gender, age, and race are rarely seen. Since
researchers [21], [22] have tried to ﬁgure out the correlation
between such data types and the infection, we may be able
to see more visualizations on dashboards in the future.

Time
The ﬁve dashboards indicate four different time inter-
vals, which are 21-days, 14-days, 7-days, and 24-hours. Four
of these dashboards update total cases by 24 hours (4/5),
which is essential information for the public. And four out of

6.1 Approach

Similar to the approach in Section 3.1, we analyse the
same ﬁve dashboards but concentrate on COVID-19 data
visualizations and interactions. We had two groups from
our research team perform open coding on the dashboards.

The members are masters students with computer science
backgrounds. Each team manually recorded and catego-
rized all the charts on dashboards and labeled them with
categories. Our teams then aggregated the them into eight
types, such as bubble charts and bar charts. After ﬁnishing
the coding, our researchers met and discussed any discrep-
ancies until consensus was reached. Furthermore, by using
Yi et al.’s criteria [23] on interaction types, we matched all
visualizations to the seven interaction techniques in Table 4.

6.2 Results

After conducting the experiments, we summarised the data
and visualizations used by the selected dashboards. We
applied the same taxonomy Fig 3 that is used in RQ2
and summarised eight visualization approaches. To simplify
the content in Table 3, we use abbreviations to represent
different visualization methods. In Table 3, we can observe
which visualization method is more suitable for what kind
of data. We also summarise the standard interaction tech-
niques implemented in different kinds of visualization.

Data and visualization
As shown in Table 3, we found that a map visualisation is
commonly applied (74%) when presenting the data related
to the location dimension. Sometimes, it is also combined
with a bubble chart, that can present COVID-19 data in
each part of the world, like Fig 5(d). Line charts are also
used to present trends, such as active cases in 7days in
the United States. Developers implement tabular data to
show the active and all cases of an area so that users can
understand detailed epidemic data. Only one dashboard
uses donuts charts to present the percentages of active cases,
total cases, and total death in the top ﬁve countries and
states, which compare the proportion of cases in different
countries or regions. We also found that histograms are
frequently used to show total death distributions in states
(5/5).

The ﬁve dashboards we analysed have fewer visualiza-
tions on the human dimension than the other three dimen-
sions. Three out of ﬁve dashboards explore the relationship
between population and the number of conﬁrmed cases, the
total number of deaths by applying a map, as can be seen
in Fig 6(a). Such visualizations can effectively compare the
infection rate per population in different areas rather than
simple numbers. During the development of the COVIDAu
dashboard, the authors have received certain requests for
this type of visualization from users.

Concerning the time dimension, all of the dashboards we
analysed use a line chart (2/2) to present the trends of active
cases in 24-hours. And three of them use histogram (3/5) to
present the distribution of total cases in 24-hours. From the

(a) Relation between popu-
lation and conﬁrm cases

(b) Multi-dimensional data on map

Fig. 6. Examples for data and visualization

tabular data in Fig 7, users can directly see the changes in
daily data. For example, “+861,748” means there are 861,748
new cases within 24 hours. A histogram demonstrates the
number of cases changing.

In others dimension, all of the dashboards analyze
the infection sources (5/5), but they each apply different
visualizations to show this data. One of them uses line
chart (1/5) to show the number of cases caused by each
infection source. Two dashboards apply tabular data (2/5),
and another two implement map (2/5). By looking at the
map, users can understand the infection situation around
their location and remind users of severe infections in the
community to protect their safety. Furthermore, the tabular
data allows users to understand the cases caused by each
source of infection.

We observed that one visualization type can often be
used to illustrate different types of data dimensions. We
divided the charts into three categories based on the number
of data dimensions: one-dimensional data, two-dimensional
data, and multi-dimensional data. According to our anal-
ysis, developers use map visualization to present time,
location, or other information, which makes it belongs to
the multi-dimensional category. For instance, in Fig 6(b),
developers apply a drop-down box for users to choose data
dimensions. Line charts and histograms typically contain
two-dimensional data. They provide time dimension and
one the other dimension (e.g., human dimension/ other
dimension) to show the trends and distributions. Such
multi-dimensional data visualizations enrich the informa-
tion users can acquire from charts, and can help users better
understand the tendency of the virus from different aspects.
One special data visualization used is on the COVIDAu
dashboard, as shown in Fig 5(c). It displays the total number
of cases of different genders and ages. This dashboard also
applies a donut chart in Fig 5(b) to compare the total cases
in male, female, and unknown sex, showing the percentage
of different genders.

approaches, applied to about 4/5 (80%) dashboards that we
collect. We also discovered that the most common interac-
tion techniques are “reconﬁgure” and “connect”. For example,
in Fig 8(a) and Fig 8(b), when the user clicks the positive
tests button, both data and baseline have been changed.

In the second column, the WHO dashboard and the
JHU dashboard implement bubble maps to visualize data.
The bubble map applies all interaction techniques except
“select” and “encode”. Tableau data is also widely applied
in those dashboards with the same proportion (80%). 3/4
of tableau data applies the techniques “explore” and “con-
nect”, and no table uses “encode” or “ﬁlter” for interaction.
Besides, three out of four tables provide the download data
function. The histogram is used in 80% of dashboards we
observed, and all of them use the “reconﬁgure” and “connect”
function, but they have not used the “select” and “encode”
interaction techniques. Donut chart and treemap are two
visualizations that fewer dashboards used (2/5 donut chart,
1/5 treemap). Though they are rarely implemented, they
can help users easily identify the partitions, and compare
them with the whole objects. Both of them use “explore” and
“reconﬁgure” techniques to interact with users, but the donut
chart also uses “ﬁlter” and “connect” techniques. All of those
dashboards implement line charts. Different from static line
charts, 80% of linear charts used “explore”, “reconﬁgure”
and “connect” interaction approaches, which allows users to
select the information that they are interested in and ignore
the rest. Compare with line charts, fewer dashboards (40%)
develop bar charts with “explore”, “reconﬁgure”, “ﬁlter”, and
“connect” to interact, which may because line chart can
better demonstrate the overall trend and is often used to
represent changes in a time series.

Additionally, we also noticed that the “encode” interac-
tion technique is not applied in all of the eight visualizations
we ﬁnd, which may be due to the fact that the COVID-
19 information is straightforward which doesn’t require

changing a type of representation for better understanding.
Whereas the technique “explores”, “reconﬁgure”, and “con-
nect” are the most common interaction techniques, which
have been used in all of the visualizations.

According to the above analysis, we ﬁnd that
treemap, tabular data, and donut charts are used
for one-dimensional data; line charts, bar charts,
and histograms always deal with two-dimensional
data; and bubble charts and maps can be adapted
for multi-dimensional data types. We also determine
that the interaction techniques “explore”, “reconﬁg-
ure”, and “connect” are the most commonly used.

7 RQ4: USERS’ COMMENTS ON CURRENT DASH-
BOARDS

In RQ4, we analyze comments from dashboards users.
Based on the comments, we further summarize pros and
cons of each dashboard, which shall help developers im-
prove the dashboards and provide a better service.

7.1 Approach

As the developers of the COVIDAu dashboard, the authors
have collected feedback about the dashboard from users to
better understand users’ needs and to try to modify the
dashboard and provide the information they need. We set
up a Google Form3 for COVIDAu dashboard users to ex-
press their feelings about the dashboard and leave us some
comments and suggestions. For the rest of the dashboards,
we crawled related tweets from Twitter between 22nd March
to 10th June 2020. We applied Twitter search API [24] to
access Twitter data. We used the command line application
to fetch the tweets which contain the dashboard names, e.g.
JHU dashboard, DXY dashboard, etc, and set the language
to English. Similar to the approach in Section 3.1, we then
performed open coding in the following way. Two authors
independently coded the comments for each dashboard to
label the comments as “Positive” or “Negative” and we stored
all the information in a table4. After the initial coding, the
two authors discussed any discrepancies and comments
categories until a consensus had been reached.

7.2 Results

Comments on COVIDAu Dashboards

In total, to date we have received 347 feedback messages
from our dashboard users. Nearly 35% of them express
their appreciation of the dashboard. However, 32% of them

requested new information related to the pandemic and
data visualizations.

The requests we received are categorized into the top-
ics we summarized in RQ1. For example, “Could you do
a breakdown of local transmission?” is asking for the trans-
mission information of COVID-19 (Topic 1 Table 2), “Need
some context in terms of why ﬂights are posted.” is related to
international travel (Topic 14 Table 2), and “Can you please
update the information regarding current regulations” is about
government policies (Topic 16 Table 2). We found all of the
requests are associated with COVID-19 information (Theme
1) and impact on society (Theme 3).

However, there are no requests that are related to the
protection approaches (Theme 2) and impact on business
(Theme 4). This may be because, for theme 2, the COVI-
DAu dashboard has covered most of these topics and the
approaches haven’t changed since the start of the pandemic.
Therefore, our users didn’t request such information. For the
impact on small business, as we will discuss in Section 8.1,
no current COVID-19 dashboards that we analyzed provide
any such information. This may indicate that though the
public is seeking this type of information online, they may
not realize that content of impact on small business can
be presented on dashboards. Hence, we haven’t received
feedback ask for information related to theme 4.

There are also requests that are related to data visualiza-
tions used. For example, “I would love a ¨new cases ¨bar graph
on the state pages” and “Really good job ... The only thing I
would like to see added is a state ﬁlter on the new cases per
day bar graph”, the two requests are asking for a bar chart
visualization on the new cases data. Moreover, requests like
“You should not have map points to people’s homes. Not everyone
is going to click and see that it is not a location of an actual
conﬁrmed case.” is suggesting not to use markers to visualize
the conﬁrmed case. Instead, all dashboards we selected use
layers or bubble charts on the map to visualize such data,
which helps users to avoid misunderstandings.

Comments from Twitter
According to Table. 6, the comments mainly concentrate
on four aspects: inﬂuence, usability, data, and visualization.
More than half of the people(63%) gave positive comments
to the dashboards. These comments mainly elaborated on
the important role that dashboards play in global epidemic
control. Some of them talked about how the interface is
user-friendly, the data is comprehensive, accurate, and real-
time updated, and the visualization of graphs helps them
understand the pandemic. For example, the comments “This
#JohnsHopkins dashboard is proving to be one of the more reliable
sources of information about the spread of coronavirus #covid19”
afﬁrmed the credibility of the JHU dashboard and the com-

ments “WHO had a central dashboard with such ﬁgures which
were up-to-date. There is a lot of value in it.” discussed the data
on the WHO dashboard is comprehensive.

There are also negative comments about dashboards as
well. According to Table. 6, those tweets mainly focus on
criticizing data accuracy, visualization, etc. 14% of the com-
ments think that the dashboard data is inaccurate, lagging,
and lacks certain types of data they need (e.g., “WHO’s dash-
board on its website which tends to lag countries’ individual tallies
showed that Monday.” and “Quick question : Why not update the
coronavirus dashboard for Yemen?”). The inaccurate data and
untimely updates could be related to different data sources
and time zones. For the lack of information that users need,
this may be because the developer does not realize that
people need this type of information, or only a small portion
of people need this type of information. About 6% of users
also raised negative comments about visualization, such as
errors in the map. For example, “If as stated Baw Baw region
has conﬁrmed cases, why is the geo point very deﬁnitely at my
property in Paynters Road Hill End? It should be at headquarters
in Warragul.... Please adjust if you want to be accurate.”. This
may be due to the developers not being familiar with the
map information or local customs and not being aware of
the problems. Users seem to have diverse positive opinions
on different dashboards. However, for negative comments,
users tend to raise similar problems. For example, users
complain that the visualizations are hard to understand on
four out of the ﬁve dashboards. Besides, comments about
data errors are also common among different dashboards.
For instance, users posted “...There’s some serious problem with
data gathering. ... How does the WHO have better data than the
states?” and “Number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. as of
yesterday according to the latest Johns Hopkins University (JHU)
data dashboard (with likely under-reporting of death numbers).”.

While most users have positive feedback to the
current dashboards, they also raised their concerns
online as well. It’s common to see users report er-
rors or bugs, request for certain types of data, and
give suggestions on data visualization. For different
dashboards, the positive comments often contain
unique information, whereas the negative comments
are similar under the categories.

8 DISCUSSION
In this section, we compare people’s information needs with
dashboard supply and discuss the gap between the two. In
addition, we also analyze the visualization and interactions
on dashboards and summarise lessons learnt from the study.

8.1 The Gap between People’s Needs and Information
Supply

Our research ﬁnds that people are more concerned about
COVID-19 information, protection approaches, society is-
sues, and business impact. However, judging from the ex-
isting dashboards we analysed in RQ2, there is still a gap
between the information on dashboards and people’s needs,
shown in Fig 9. Most of the dashboards we investigated
include the impact of COVID-19 on people, such as conﬁrm
cases, death. This part also contains protective measures and
methods, such as a correct hand-washing video.

Fig. 9. Information gap between people’s needs and dashboard supply
Nevertheless, no dashboards cover the impact on the
business dimension like a series of government policies for
SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and some topics we
present in Table 2(ID: 2,3,4,7,17,18,19). We summarise three
reasons why the above information is absent. One reason
is that data is challenging to visualize, for example, data
with high dimensions like economic market data. Economic
market ﬂuctuations are affected by many factors, such as
government ﬁscal and monetary policy and natural disas-
ters/extreme weather ﬂuctuations [25].

Another reason is that such data can be hard to collect.
For the above missing information, developers can collect
local labour market information during the epidemic for
visualization and then reﬂect the impact of the epidemic on
the economic market. Similar to the 1Point3Acres website,
they use the number of people who declared unemployment
insurance during COVID-19 to show the impact of the epi-
demic on the unemployment rate, which is also a reﬂection
of the COVID-19’s impact on society.

The last reason is that perhaps the developers didn’t
realize that people need this information. Most dashboards
we analysed focus on general COVID-19 information, which
is the majority of users’ essential information needs. Some
information needs are for a speciﬁc group. For example,
business-related information is more critical for business
owners so that the developers may not realize this type of
information needs.

8.2 Data Visualization and Interaction

In terms of data visualization types used, we ﬁnd that
dynamic visualizations are widely used compared with

12

(b) Flights on tabular data

static charts when observing the changing data, as they can
make it easier for users to understand [26]. Our research
team collected data about user activity on our dashboard
to analyze which visualization is frequently used. After
analyzing users behavior on the COVIDAu website, we
found that the map visualization is the most popular one
as 71.7% of users used this visualization, seen in Table. 7.
Users do not often interact with tabular data search, and this
may be because the map information will be more obscure
and require users to further explore through some interac-
tive operations. However, tabular data is more intuitive, so
relatively few user interaction operations are required.

Visualizations can reduce the cognitive cost of inspect-
ing, but sometimes it depends on the user’s cognitive styles
and task difﬁculties. Luo’s research [27] ﬁnds that users’
cognitive styles have signiﬁcant effects on how they choose
the visualization format. For example, a table format is
always chosen by users with verbalizer cognitive style. A
complex data visualisation type can increase the difﬁculty of
the user’s understanding. For example, consider the select
countries operation in the linear chart Fig 10(a), 7% users
use this interaction because many users don’t know that the
country on the picture can be selected and compared with
the drop down list. This design is more complicated and
challenging to use. Similarly, for tabular data in Fig 10(b),
users prefer to see the data they want intuitively. That’s why
there are only 1% of users used the search function.

Beside the COVID-19 dashboard, we also compare the
ﬁndings in data visualization and interaction with other
crisis event dashboards. On the NASA Disasters Program
Response Locations dashboard [28], it is clear that the line
charts and bar charts contain two-dimensional data (time
and event), and developers use “connect” interaction ap-
proach to help users with a better understanding. The map
visualization on this dashboard uses “explore” and “connect”
approaches, and displays multi-dimensional data (time, lo-
cation, and event) to users. Another dashboard for Flow and
Drought Management in the Delaware River Basin [29] also
shows two-dimensional data on both line charts (time and
ﬂow) and bar charts (location and usable storage).

8.3 Lessons Learnt on Data Visualization

We summarize three lessons learnt from mistakes made by
the dashboards on data visualizations. The lessons may be
helpful for developers who plan to develop a dashboard,
and bring a better web service to the audience.

Visualize Sensitive Data with Caution During the de-
velopment of the COVIDAu dashboard, we used small red
markers to represent conﬁrmed cases in certain suburbs.

Aviation IndustryMobilityDaily COVID-19 DataProtection ApproachesTransmission of COVID-19Races and Test ResultsCOVID-19 Cases and PopulationOther VirusThe origin of COVID-19Impact on BusinessImpact on School/ UniversityVaccine DevelopmentFake newsImpact on WomenPeople NeedsDashboard Information SupplyThe markers were set in the center of the suburb maps by
default, which caused problems that they may be set on the
top of someone’s property or in a desert. These were so con-
fusing to the public that we received complaints and ques-
tions constantly. We then replaced it with different shades
of blue to represent conﬁrmed cases in a certain area to
avoid the ambiguous and misunderstanding. Every number
behind the map represents human lives, when visualizing
this type of data(sensitive), developers or website designers
should be more careful about the types of chart/map to use
to provide many accurate and useful data to the public.

Annotate Complex Visualizations From the users’ per-
spective, some of the data visualizations are not easy to
understand. For example, as shown in Fig 10(a), the concept
of this chart was borrowed from this site [30], and similar
charts have been found in two of the dashboards. The chart
uses the logarithmic scale of total conﬁrmed cases and the
newly conﬁrmed cases per week as X and Y axis to better
demonstrate the trend of the pandemic. Since dashboards
users are from different age groups and backgrounds, it’s
hard for some of them to understand the meaning behind
it. The authors also received a number of requirements from
users asking for instructions on how to read the chart when
developing the COVIDAu. Therefore, proper annotations
for the visualizations and domain-speciﬁc terms are re-
quired to help users process the information on dashboards.
Use Professional and Consistent Terms We noticed that
different dashboards may have different terms for the same
concept that could confuse users. For example, the COVI-
DAu dashboard used to have Existing Case to represent the
cases that have been conﬁrmed but haven’t recovered or
died, whereas other dashboards were using Active Case. The
inconsistency in wording has triggered users to question
the professionalism of the dashboard, and concern about
the data accuracy. Similar situations were also identiﬁed
in other dashboards. To help users understand information
on dashboards, software engineers need to use professional
terms instead of synonym words in data visualization.

In this work, we conﬁrm the gap between people’s
information needs and dashboard information supply. We
also ﬁnd the main types and patterns of data visualization
and interaction on dashboards and summarized lessons
learnt from the study. However, there are several issues that
require further improvement, such as how to improve the
accuracy in tweet question detection.

9 THREATS TO VALIDITY

We summarized three validity threats that can be bias of our
empirical study.

Construct validity: is related to the metrics and mea-
surement procedures we used to code the dashboards and
extract information needs. Most constructs that we apply
are deﬁned and used in previous research, i.e., the question
detection [31] and LDA topic modeling [32].

Internal validity: is related to evolution of dashboard
development, tweets trends changing in different stages
of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the human bias when
collecting information supplies from dashboards. In an on-
line environment, dashboards are consistently updated and
improved. To mitigate the dashboard evolution threat, we

13

regularly update our information supply sheet and use
the latest version for experiments. Regarding the changing
trends of information needs on social media, we will keep
collecting data and prepare for future research. All the
information supplies we identify are collect manually, which
is can be a bias to the result.

External validity: measures how much the results of our
study can be generalized. One threat to external validity is
the limitation of the tweets and dashboards in our study.
In our approach, we only select the English tweets and
observe ﬁve dashboards. To mitigate this threat, we can
use auto-translate tools or machine learning models [33]
to include tweets from other languages and also add more
popular dashboards from a broader areas. Another threat is
whether the ﬁndings can be generalized to other dashboards
outside of our research. To mitigate this threat, we obtain
dashboards from diverse sources that contain both local and
global dashboards and originate from various countries.

10 RELATED WORKS

We brieﬂy discuss some efforts that have been made by
developers to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, and some
work related to dashboard development.

10.1 Developers’ Efforts in Battling COVID-19

Pellert et al. [34] build a self-updating sentiment monitor
by retrieving data from the news platform, Twitter, and
a forum for young adults in Austria. Chrysler et al. [35]
designed a mobile application to track the geolocation of
patients, which could help people avoid being in contact
with the COVID-19 patients. Davalbhakta et al. [36] per-
formed a review of mobile apps related to COVID-19 and
assessed their qualities. Kabir and Madria [37] develop a
real-time COVID-19 tweet analyzer, CoronaVis, which track-
ing, collecting, and analyzing tweets related to COVID-19.
In terms of topics related to COVID-19 in Twitter, Zheng et
al. [38] discussed popular topics among Twitter users from
11 March to 25 March 2020 and Asgari-Chenaghlu et al. [39]
applied natural language processing to detect the trending
COVID-19 related topics in Twitter. Chang et al. [40] and
Zhang et al. [41] explored people’s concerns on Twitter
during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Zhang et al.’s study
also performed sentiments and disparities analysis.

Similar to Pellert et al.’s research [34], our research also
checks word distributions from the database and extracts
the requirements with high accuracy. So far, no work seems
to have been done on the gap between COVID-19 dash-
boards information supply and people’s information needs.
Our work investigates the information and visualization on
dashboards and compares it with people’s questions related
to COVID-19 information seeking on Twitter.

10.2 Dashboard Development

Developers have invented different types of information
dashboards in various domains response to problems such
as slow information dissemination or misinformation. The
information dashboard, as an emerging tool, has been ex-
plored to update real-time data and visualize data.

From 2003, dashboards like [42], [43] have been devel-
oped to serve the public needs for virus like SARS, Ebola,
and Zika. Nowadays, in response to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, Boulos and Geraghty [44] performed research on
map-based dashboards such as the dashboard developed by
JHU to identify types of data that is presented on the map
and discuss the limitation of the JHU dashboard. Arneson
et al. [45] developed a real-time COVID-19 tracker at the
US level for people without a data science background.
They created several novel visualizations, which include
local cases doubling times and estimated ICU requirements
by county. Yoo and Kronenfeld [46] carried out research to
ﬁgure out the best visualization approaches for the epi-
demiological data during the COVID-19 pandemic. They
raised questions about data variables, visual variables, map
interaction, and dashboard response speed.

There is an increasing number of dashboards developed
by various countries to help manage COVID-19 pandemic
issues. Wissel et al. [47] aggregate data and public an in-
teractive dashboard in the US. The COVID-19 tracker [48]
and Daniel Conlon’s dashboard [49] covers global COVID-
19 information. Dashboards can provide front-end visual-
izations and data management services, the works below
also explore these two services. Chen et al. [50] talked about
visualization design on the interface to perform a better un-
derstanding of the service performance. They provided the
recommendations visualizations and the steps of drawing
the visualization. Zheng et al. [51] conducted an evalua-
tion on real-world web service, collected and released web
service QoS data sets for further research. Another work
[52] explored perceived quality from the user’s perspective
for service selection and composition. They named this
quality as quality of experience (QoE). The above works
focus on building a dashboard or analyzing some speciﬁc
elements on front-end and data management services. Our
work covered several dashboards, and we applied open
coding strategies to collect data on each dashboard. We
also analyzed the data provided, visualization approaches
and interaction techniques used on these dashboards to
summarise the key usage patterns among them.

11 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The information dashboard has become an essential tool to
make sense of ever-changing data in this data-driven world.
Thus, ensuring that the information supplies actually serve
people’s needs has become a priority for dashboard design
and development. In this research, we explore the informa-
tion needs of COVID-19 dashboard users and conducted a
study of ﬁve COVID-19 information dashboards. We con-
ducted tweet analysis and collected information from dash-
boards using an open coding approach. We identiﬁed four
key dimensions of information on COVID-19 dashboards:
location, human, time, and others. We further explained
sub-dimension information that should be considered when
developing a crisis management and information dash-
board. We illustrated the variety of visualization types and
interaction mechanisms that these dashboards support. We
determined the current gap between people’s information
needs and information supplied on COVID-19 dashboards
based on our data analysis. To make visualizations more

14

accessible for future crisis dashboard development, devel-
opers need to use appropriate visual designs to present
different information types and need to support suitable
interaction techniques to navigate using different visual-
izations. We also summarized lessons that shall prevent
developers from making the same mistakes in the future.

As our future work, we plan to validate and extend the
ﬁndings by studying a more extensive set of dashboards
with more diverse visualizations and interaction dimen-
sions. Furthermore, we plan to explore the approaches of
mining information needs with higher accuracy. We also
want to support other types of information analysis such
as the misinformation topic detection during the pandemic.
