ABSTRACT

In this paper, we study stellar light curves from the TESS satellite (Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite) for the presence of stellar ﬂares. The main aim is to detect stellar ﬂares using two-minutes ca-
dence data and to perform statistical analysis. To ﬁnd and analyze stellar ﬂares we prepared automatic
software WARPFINDER. We implemented three methods described in this paper: trend, diﬀerence,
and proﬁle ﬁtting. Automated search for ﬂares was accompanied by visual inspection. Using our
software we analyzed two-minute cadence light curves of 330,000 stars located in the ﬁrst 39 sectors
of TESS observations. As a result, we detected over 25,000 stars showing ﬂare activity with the total
number of more than 140,000 ﬂares. This means that about 7.7% of all the analyzed objects are ﬂaring
stars. The estimated ﬂare energies range between 1031 and 1036 erg. We prepared a preliminary pre-
view of the statistical distribution of parameters such as a ﬂare duration, amplitudes and energy, and
compared it with previous results. The relationship between stellar activity and its spectral type, tem-
perature and mass was also statistically analyzed. Based on the scaling laws, we estimated the average
values of the magnetic ﬁeld strength and length of the ﬂare loops. In our work, we used both single
(about 60%), and double (about 40%) ﬂare proﬁles to ﬁt the observational data. The components of
the double proﬁle are supposed to be related to the direct heating of the photosphere by non-thermal
electrons and back warming processes.

1. INTRODUCTION

Many stars show ﬂares similar to solar ﬂares, especially the main-sequence stars of spectral types G, K, and M. This
is most likely due to a similar ﬂare mechanism - magnetic reconnection. These stars also have a convective zone, which
for the coolest objects can even span the entire star (Reid & Hawley 2005). The strength of the star’s magnetic ﬁeld
is related to the motion of plasma due to convection (Benz & G¨udel 2010).

Stellar ﬂares are highly energetic, rapid events, that occur during magnetic reconnection in the stellar coronae.
Stored magnetic energy is impulsively released, converted into other forms of energy and consequently radiated across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays (Kowalski et al. 2019; Jain et al. 2011). During the
impulsive phase of solar ﬂares and their analogs occurring on late spectral-type stars, beams of non-thermal electrons,
accelerated somewhere in the solar or stellar coronae, stream along magnetic lines toward the chromosphere, where
they heat plasma by colliding with the dense matter near the feet of the loops. The interactions of the non-thermal
electrons with dense matter also cause a strong and variable in time emission of hard X-rays (HXR) in the feet of the
loops (via the so-called bremsstrahlung process) (Brown 1971; Emslie 1978). The chromospheric matter, heated up
to coronal temperatures, expands, ﬁlling the magnetic ropes (such a process is called chromospheric evaporation) and
emits soft X-rays (SXR) (Antonucci et al. 1984; Fisher et al. 1985). At the same time, a large amount of energy is
radiated away from the loop-feet in the visible and ultraviolet signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the energy balance of the whole
ﬂare. The signiﬁcant emission in the visual domain can be observed locally in solar ﬂares (with high spatial and time
resolutions), or it can be observed as a temporary variation of the integrated emission of the whole star.

The optical emission of a solar ﬂare consists of a continuous spectrum (continuum) and chromospheric lines. During
the majority of solar ﬂares, the intensity of the continuum does not increase noticeably, while the intensity of spectral
lines, formed mainly in the solar chromosphere and the transition region (TR), may increase signiﬁcantly (Kowalski

et al. 2015). The continuum optical emission is formed mainly in the solar/stellar photosphere, where the temperature
and density are almost undisturbed during ﬂares, and therefore the intensity of continuum is not aﬀected by the
ﬂares. On the contrary, the hydrogen, calcium, magnesium, and other chromospheric lines are formed in the middle
or higher chromosphere (Mihalas 1978), where the plasma parameters are strongly modiﬁed by diﬀerent ﬂare heating
mechanisms. Therefore, the emission in these lines is strongly enhanced during ﬂares. The main plasma parameters,
which may inﬂuence the intensity of the spectral lines, are the temperature and density of the plasma. During solar
ﬂares, the values of both parameters increases due to non-thermal plasma heating and evaporation of the chromospheric
plasma. The amount of such increases depends on the energy budget of all heating and cooling mechanisms.

The above-described situation is valid for most average-size solar ﬂares. However, in some big ﬂares the ﬂux and the
energy of accelerated non-thermal particles are as height that the heating of the low-lying solar photosphere or the
lower chromosphere is possible. Then, the continuum optical emission may arise from some ﬂare areas. Such ﬂares
are called “white-light” ﬂares and they were observed in the past (Machado & Rust 1974; Hiei 1982; Neidig & Wiborg
1984).

Assuming the photospheric origin of white-light ﬂare emission, the most probable mechanism that may be responsible
for this continuum is H− emission (Ding et al. 1994). It is possible that the photosphere is not heated directly by
non-thermal particles but during the process of “radiative backwarming,” where the non-thermal electrons deposit
their energy in the chromosphere and then, the hotter chromosphere radially heats the lower-lying photosphere (Fang
& Ding 1995). More recent studies show that the ﬂare continuum emission can be formed in the thin “layer” of the
chromosphere in the process of hydrogen recombination (Potts et al. 2010).

Research and observations of white-light ﬂares from nearby stars have been rapidly developing in recent years thanks
to large optical photometric surveys. For example, Davenport et al. (2014), Walkowicz et al. (2011), and Hawley et al.
(2014) used data from the Kepler mission, for which time resolution was 1 minute (SC - short cadence) or 30 minutes
(LC - long cadence). Other examples are Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000), EVRYSCOPE (Law
et al. 2014), All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASASSN) (Bersier 2016) or Next Generation Transit Survey
(NGTS) (Wheatley et al. 2018).

Duration times of white-light ﬂares usually vary from minutes to hours, with a fast rise and a slower exponential
decay proﬁles. Typical ﬂare energies range from 1026 to 1032 erg. So-called super-ﬂares with energies between 1032
and 1036 erg are also observed (Schaefer et al. 2000; Shibayama et al. 2013). Flare activity is thought to be correlated
with fast rotation and a late spectral type of a star. About 40% of M-type dwarfs are ﬂaring stars (Yang et al. 2017;
G¨unther et al. 2020; Howard et al. 2019). Moreover, detecting ﬂares on late-type stars is easier because of the high
ﬂare contrast caused by a low surface temperature. The TESS mission provides us with the opportunity to study a
large number and a variety of stellar ﬂares.

In this paper, we examined light curves from the TESS satellite (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) for the
presence of stellar ﬂares. We analyzed stellar ﬂares from the ﬁrst 39 sectors of the TESS mission. Our study
investigates the preliminary statistics of stellar ﬂares. It also includes relationships between stellar ﬂares and such
stellar properties as mass, eﬀective temperature, and spectral type. In Section 2 we describe the TESS observations.
Our software and methodology to ﬁnd ﬂare candidates are detailed in Section 3. The results are presented and
compared with previous ﬁndings in Section 4, and a discussion is provided in Section5.

2. OBSERVATIONS

TESS (Ricker et al. 2014) is a space-based telescope launched in April 2018.

Its orbit is highly elliptical, with
a period of 13.7 days. The main goal of the mission is to search for exoplanets using the transit method. TESS
instrument consists of four 10.5-cm telescopes, each covering a ﬁeld-of-view of 24 × 24 degrees. In a single pointing
TESS cameras cover a ﬁeld of view of 24 × 96 degrees. A given sector is observed through two satellite orbits, that
is, for slightly less than a month. The ﬁrst part of the mission, completed in July 2020, consisted of observations
of 26 sectors in both hemispheres covering about 85% of the sky. During the ongoing extended part of the mission,
observations of the next 29 sectors (27 – 55) are carried out. The sectors partly overlap, which results in the presence
of the continuous viewing zone in the vicinity of both ecliptic poles. During the primary part of the mission, two
cadences were realized, 2-min cadence for a sample pre-selected objects and 30-min cadence for the whole covered
FoV. The latter cadence is oﬀered as Full Frame Images that can be used to extract photometry for any object in
the FoV. During the extended part of the mission, two short-time cadences, 2-min and 20-s, were chosen for selected
objects, while FFIs are oﬀered with a 10-min cadence. The FFIs have angular resolution of 21 arcsec per pixel.

Almost 330 000 stars observed with TESS in two-min cadence are in our sample, therefore we can study a huge number
of stellar ﬂares with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We selected calibrated, short cadence PDCSAP (Pre-search Data
Conditioning Simple Aperture Photometry) light curves downloaded from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes
(MAST). Moreover, we required the Quality ﬂag to be equal to 0 and normalized light curves by dividing the ﬂux by
the mean ﬂux of a star. If available we took mass, radius, spectral types, and other stellar parameters from MAST and
SIMBAD databases if possible. All the stars with spectral types earlier than F1 were rejected from our analysis. The
eﬀective temperatures of the ﬂaring stars in our sample is limited to stars cooler than about 8000 K with masses smaller
than about 1.7 M(cid:12). This limitation is enforced by numerous rapid changes in light curves of hot stars, which are
similar in shape to stellar ﬂares. These changes were often misclassiﬁed by our algorithm as ﬂares. Stellar variability
of the RR Lyrae, δ Scuti, γ Doradus, and SX Phoenicis was particularly problematic. After analyzing stars from the
ﬁrst 39 sectors of TESS observations, we found more than 25,000 ﬂaring stars and 140,000 individual events.

3. SOFTWARE

The software WARPFINDER (Wroclaw AlgoRithm Prepared For detectINg anD analyzing stEllar ﬂaRes) prepared
by us is written in the IDL (Interactive Data Language) and Python programming languages, which are mainly used
for stellar ﬂare identiﬁcation and analysis. The software has also been adapted to automatically download information
about stars from MAST and SIMBAD (Set of Identiﬁcations, Measurements and Bibliography for Astronomical Data),
as well as data from the TESS satellite. Our automatic procedure also rejects most false detections such as asteroids,
transits, or stellar pulsations. The appearance of an asteroid is usually observed in a stellar light curve as a strong,
symmetrical increase of ﬂux. Our software checks the asymmetry of each detection and rejects overly symmetrical
phenomena. In addition, this shape is not well described by the ﬂare proﬁle we assumed. Many false detections occur
during transits when the ﬂux increases rapidly. To eliminate them, we added to the software the conditions regarding
the relationship between the value of the signal at the beginning, at the maximum, and at the end of the ﬂare. The
most problematic, however, was the numerous false detections associated with short-period stellar pulsations. For this
reason, we have limited our analysis to only stars with spectral types later than F0. The remaining false detections
are rejected during partial visual inspection. The tables and diagrams containing data about detected stellar ﬂares
and the ﬂaring stars are the ﬁnal results of using software.

3.1. Methods

We prepared an automated, unsupervised three-step method for ﬁnding ﬂare events from TESS data. To search for
potential ﬂaring stars, we analyzed the 307 281 available targets with TESS PDCSAP light curves from the ﬁrst 39
sectors. In our research we need data without systematic trends, so PDCSAP ﬂux was more appropriate than SAP
(Simple Aperture Photometery) ﬂux. In this work, we used light curves with a time resolution of two minutes.

3.1.1. Trend method

One of the methods of ﬁnding stellar ﬂares is the trend method. The ﬁrst step is based on consecutive de-trending
of light curves using smoothing with several window lengths. This method was inspired by automated procedures
described by Davenport et al. (2014) and tested on Kepler data. We smoothed the observed ﬂux with the running
average (smooth) function with a window length of 175 points (350 min). For this calculated trend we determined
the standard deviation, and then calculated the new trend, rejecting all points protruding more than 3σ above the
trend. We repeated this step recursively ﬁve times. For further analysis, we selected all points 1σ above the trend.
We deﬁned all the series of these points where at least four points protrude above the 2.5σ level as ﬂares. They do
not have to be consecutive points. There can be individual points between them where the deviation is less than 2.5σ,
but greater than 1σ. The probability that a single point occurring randomly above the 2.5σ threshold is 0.0062. The
likelihood of randomly getting 4 out of 7 such consecutive points drops to about 5 × 10−12. This gives us a chance for
one false detection of a ﬂare in one sector of properly detrended observations around 1 × 10−7.

We repeat above operation for the next ﬁve smoothing windows with lengths of 31, 75, 121, 221, and 311 points,
respectively. The next ﬂares determined in this way are added to the previous ones if the times of their maximums do
not lie within the limits of the ﬂares determined earlier. We have applied a few diﬀerent values of smoothing windows
because many ﬂaring stars have more than one period of variability. These windows can be chosen as free parameters
in our code and the values used here were selected experimentally on the data from TESS sector 1, 2 and 3. We
checked these values for another set of thousands of ﬂares and they seem to work pretty well for data with a 2 minute
cadence.

4

There are many false detections caused by non-adequate (usually too long) trend windows. Before the visual
inspection, we verify these bad signals using other search methods in the next two steps of our automatic procedure.

3.1.2. Diﬀerence method

The second method of ﬁnding stellar ﬂares is the diﬀerence method whose idea was taken from the paper by
Shibayama et al. (2013). The method is based on checking the ﬂux diﬀerence between two consecutive points. In our
method, contrary to the authors of the cited paper, we do not check the percentage distribution of diﬀerences, but
the standard deviation instead. We assumed the study of points whose sigma is greater than 3σ as a default value.
The spread of points is analyzed only for the positive values. All points that exceed 3σ are marked as potential ﬂare
detection and the times are compared with the hits detected by the trend method. It should be noted, that only the
mutual detection of probable ﬂares in a designated time is treated by the software as true detection and passed on to
the third level of veriﬁcation.

3.2. Flare proﬁle method

The prepared list of potential stellar ﬂares, which were detected by both previous methods, is then veriﬁed by a
detailed analysis of their light curve proﬁles. In the ﬁrst step of the proﬁle method, we try to properly determine
the beginning and the end time of a stellar ﬂare. From the trend method, we obtain an estimated range of the ﬂare
duration. We use it to ﬁnd the pre-ﬂare and post-ﬂare background approximated by a linear function. A linear
background is suﬃcient in most cases. The standard duration of the ﬂares usually does not exceed several dozen
minutes. The percentage of stars rotating fast enough to aﬀect the background determination is negligible in such a
large sample of detected ﬂares. Then we iteratively determine a new time of the start and the end of the ﬂare and
repeat the whole procedure 10 times. This value was selected on the basis of tests performed by us. In each iteration,
we try to ﬁt the proﬁle for each test start and end point and choose the best ﬁt based on the χ2 value. Further, if
the best solution is correct, we detected it as a ﬂare. The ﬁnal linear trend is ﬁtted to the observational points and
outliers are treated as a stellar ﬂare.

In the next step, we ﬁt the assumed ﬂare proﬁles to the observational data. The ﬁrst proﬁle (Equation 1) of a ﬂare

is given by equation (Gryciuk et al. 2017):

f (t) =

√

)]

where A, B, C, D are parameters, t is the time and erf

is the error function. This proﬁle is a convolution of
the Gaussian proﬁle (heating function) and exponential decay (function describing processes of energy loss). The A
parameter is related to the amplitude of the ﬂare. Parameter B determines the maximum energy release. Parameter
C informs about the time scale of the energy release. The inverse of the D parameter is related to the ﬂare decay time.
We noticed that some of the ﬂares do not ﬁt well with only one proﬁle. For this reason, we also performed a ﬁt created
from two similar proﬁles. In one case, we used proﬁles characterized by a small shift in the time of the maximum of
both components (Equation 2). These components have the same value as the B parameter. In the second case, we
allowed both components to have large shifts between the time of their maximums, and thus diﬀerent values of the B
parameter (Equation 3).

We checked the quality of each of the ﬂare proﬁle ﬁts. We used the χ2 statistic for this purpose. The ﬁt with has
the lowest χ2 value was selected for a further analysis. For good ﬁts, this value usually does not exceed 3.0 of reduced
χ2 (taking into account the number of data points and the number of degrees of freedom). To distinguish a stellar
ﬂare from data noise we also used the probability density function of F-distribution. We calculate the reduced χ2
for the observational data with the ﬁtted ﬂare proﬁle and the estimated trend. Next, we computed the cumulative
distribution function for an F-distribution with deﬁned degrees of freedom. We accepted the detection as a ﬂare if the
probability is less than the cutoﬀ value. After carrying out the earlier tests, we assumed that this value cannot exceed

Pietras et al. 2022

0.1. Additional methods to reject false detections are: the calculation of the ﬂare proﬁle, skewness and the bisectors
of the proﬁle. For the purposes of this work, we deﬁne skewness in general as a measure of ﬂare proﬁle asymmetry.
We assumed that a stellar ﬂare should have a shorter rise time than its decay time. For this reason, the skewness of
the proﬁle should be a positive value. The bisector method gives information about the symmetry of the ﬂare proﬁle.
Bisectors are deﬁned by lines at the level of 10%, 20%, etc. of the maximum signal value. If the bisector method
indicates an overly symmetrical proﬁle (a value of about 0 or less), then the detection must be veriﬁed visually by a
software user. Moreover, detections with a duration of less than 12 minutes (six points) are rejected.

After the analysis, separate data sets (three folders) with detections are created. The ﬁrst one contains mostly real
ﬂares. The second set is for uncertain events that require visual inspection. The third set contains the detections
rejected by the software.

3.3. A ﬂare injection-recovery tests

A ﬂare injection-recovery test were performed to validate the results found via all three methods described in this
paper. As in G¨unther et al. (2020), we decided to use two separate tests. For each of them, we selected randomly
1000 light curves of spectral type F, G or K stars, as well as early M dwarfs and late M dwarfs. For the ﬁrst test, we
artiﬁcially added 10 time-separated ﬂares to each light curve. In the second test, we also inserted 10 ﬂares, but they
were only separated by 10 minutes up to a maximum of 1 hour. Each of the inserted ﬂares was described by a single
proﬁle described above with randomly selected parameters. The range of this parameters was determined on the basis
of the stellar ﬂares we have observed.

After proper preparation of the light curves, we tested our three-step software. In the case of both tests, we considered
the ﬂares as detected if their maximum was determined within the previously assumed duration. The Figure 1 shows
the test results we obtained. From the top three panels it can be seen that well detected ﬂares usually have amplitudes
greater than 0.01. Moreover, for M-type dwarfs, the mean recovery rate is lower. This is due to the lower brightness
and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of lightcurves of these stars. These dependencies are well illustrated by the three
lower panels. It can be noticed that the recovery rate signiﬁcantly decreases with the SNR, TESS magnitude and
eﬀective temperature of stars.

Figure 1. The results of a ﬂare injection-recovery tests. The three top panels show the recovery rate as a function of the
injected ﬂares’ amplitudes and FWHM in minutes. From the left, these are the results for dwarfs of the F, K, or G (a), M0-4
(b) and M4-9 (C) types. The three bottom panels show the recovery rate as a function of the injected ﬂares’ amplitudes and
the logarithm of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of a stellar lightcurve (d), TESS magnitude (e), and stellar eﬀective temperature
(f). On the right, there is the colorbar of recovery rate in percentage.

The maximum luminosity and the total energy of ﬂares are estimated in two diﬀerent methods. The ﬁrst one
requires a ﬂare amplitude, a ﬂare duration, a stellar luminosity, and a radius. Kowalski et al. (2016) showed using
hydrodynamic simulations that a temperature of about 10000 K is needed in order to correctly reproduce the ﬂare
emission on M stars in the range of white light. Thus, we assumed black body-radiation and the eﬀective temperature
of the ﬂare (Tf lare) about 10000 K (Shibayama et al. 2013; Mochnacki & Zirin 1980; Hawley & Fisher 1992).

The ﬂare amplitude (C (cid:48)

f lare) is deﬁned as follows:

C (cid:48)

f lare = F (cid:48)

f lare/F (cid:48)

where σSB is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.
For a star for which information about radius is available, it is possible to estimate the luminosity and energy emitted

during the ﬂare. According to Shibayama et al. (2013), the total energy uncertainty in this method is about 60%.

To estimate the energy of detected ﬂares in the TESS detector bandpass we also used the modiﬁed method proposed
by Kov´ari et al. (2007). It was described in Vida & Roettenbacher (2018) and Vida et al. (2019). This method is
based on the following integrating normalized ﬂare intensity with subtracted background during the ﬂare event:

(cid:90) t2

εTESS =

C (cid:48)

ﬂaredt

(10)

t1
where t1 and t2 are the times of a start and an end of the ﬂare. The integral εTESS is relative ﬂare energy. Next, we had
to estimate ﬂux of the star in a selected interval of wavelengths (λ1, λ2), which are wavelengths of the TESS detector
bandpass. To estimate ﬂux of a star we multiply spectrum of the star F(λ), taken from ATLAS91 for stars log(g),
Teﬀ (in spectra we assumed metallicity of the Sun and vturb = 2 km s−1), with TESS response function STESS(λ)
multiplied by stars area with radius R. Due to the use of the theoretical spectrum of stars from ATLAS9, there is no
factor 4 in the following equation:

λ1
To estimate the ﬂare energy in the TESS detector bandpass Eﬂare, we multiplied star’s ﬂux Fstar in a selected interval
of wavelengths by relative ﬂare energy εTESS:

Fstar = πR2

Flare energies estimated in this way are not bolometric. For this reason, they have lower values than for the ﬁrst

(12)

method, which is based on Shibayama et al. (2013).

3.5. Problematic cases

7

Our program for automatic detection of stellar ﬂares WARPFINDER may not work properly in a few cases. We
observed a particularly large number of false detections on stars with spectral types earlier than F0. These are stars
that are often characterized by a rapid variation in the light curve. An example is the RR Lyrae stars, whose periods
of variation can be several hours. Moreover, the shape of the brightness changes is similar to the ﬂare proﬁle assumed
by us. It is characterized by a rapid growth phase and slow decay. Similar variability, classiﬁed as ﬂares, is observed
for δ Scuti, γ Doradus, and SX Phoenicis stars.

Flare detection is also diﬃcult for very cool M spectral type stars. Due to their low brightness, light curves have a
low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, faint ﬂares are not detectable by our software. This conclusion is also conﬁrmed
by injection-recovery tests performed by us.

Moreover, our ﬂare catalog may include some false detections that are only observed once per star in all available
sectors. This is due to a random spike in the signal accidentally classiﬁed as a ﬂare. However, we decided not to
exclude such stars from the analysis, so as not to remove information about real ﬂaring stars.

4. RESULTS

In this paper, we presented the results of the analysis of 329,176 stars from the ﬁrst 39 sectors of TESS observations.
We found 25,229 ﬂaring stars and 147,683 individual ﬂares. The catalog with all detected ﬂares is available in machine-
readable form. Approximately 7.7% of all observed stars show ﬂaring activity. This value varies depending on a spectral
type of the studied stars and is greater than 50% for the stars of spectral type M. On average, there are four ﬂares
per each ﬂaring star observed during about 25 days (one TESS sector). We observed up to 69 ﬂares on one star
in one sector (TIC266744225, Figure 2). Moreover, on the TIC150359500 we found 863 events during 23 sectors of
observation.

marked with red dots.

Figure 3 shows the histogram of ﬂares’f occurrence frequency per day. In most cases, one ﬂare is observed on one star
every ten days. There are, however, a few very active stars, where average ﬂare activity equals more than two events
a day (TIC266744225, TIC142206123, TIC441420236). A similar result was obtained by Davenport (2016), but for a
much larger sample of ﬂares. In Table 1 we compare the number of stars observed in each of the 39 sectors with the
number of ﬂaring stars and individual ﬂares. The hypothesis about the uniform distribution of stellar ﬂares in sectors
was rejected based on the performed Pearson’s χ2 test. Pearson’s χ2 test against the hypothesis of uniform distribution

returns a value of 840 for 35 degrees of freedom, which exceeds the acceptable value for the assumed probability of
the hypothesis. Moreover, there is an increase in the percentage of ﬂaring stars during the TESS Extended Mission
(sectors above 27). This may be related to the change in the way of selecting observation targets. Now, about 80% of
targets per sector come from Guest Investigator (GI) programs. In total, we found 9480 ﬂaring stars during the ﬁrst
year of TESS observations (S01-S13, ecliptic declination from -90 ◦ to -54 ◦). For comparison, during the third year of
the mission, when the southern hemisphere was re-observed (S27-S39), we found 10 661 ﬂaring stars, including 8913
new objects.

4.1. Parameters of ﬂaring stars

10

The analysis carried out in this work allowed us to determine the distribution of the basic parameters of ﬂaring
stars, such as eﬀective temperature, spectral type, mass, and magnitude (Figure 4 and Figure 5). All analyzed stars
are marked in gray, and ﬂaring stars are marked in blue. The analyzed data sample of ﬂaring stars includes only stars
with spectral types later than F0. For this reason, most of these stars’ eﬀective temperatures do not exceed 8,000 K
and 1.7 solar masses. As can be seen in Figure 4, the observed distributions of the presented parameters for the ﬂaring
stars are generally diﬀerent than those for the entire sample of stars.

Figure 4. Histograms of the number of the ﬂaring stars compared with the total number of stars in the TESS observations of
sectors 01-39 shown as a function of the stellar eﬀective temperature (the left panel ), the stellar spectral type (the middle panel )
(in our work only ﬂaring stars later than the F0 spectral type are analyzed) and the stellar mass (the right panel ).

Figure 5. Histograms of the number of the ﬂaring stars compared with the total number of stars in the TESS observations
of sectors 01-39 shown as a function of TESS (the upper left panel ), B (the upper right panel ), U (the lower left panel ), V (the
lower right panel ) magnitude.

There is some similarity in the temperature distribution of the ﬂaring stars, where the main maximum is about
3,000 K and the second one about 6,000 K. They are characteristic for the entire studied population. The distributions
of ﬂaring stars’ spectral types and masses are dominated by stars with the spectral type M and masses of one solar
mass or less. The distributions of TESS, B, V, and U magnitudes for all stars and the ﬂaring stars seems to be similar
(Figure 5). However, based on the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test we reject the hypothesis that these samples
are of the same distribution. We used samples of TESS, B, V, and U magnitudes for all stars and only for the ﬂaring

Pietras et al. 2022

11

stars. The distribution of U magnitude of the ﬂaring stars is the least similar to the entire sample distribution due to
the fact that the sample’s of stellar U magnitude is only about 10% of all stars observed by TESS.

The parameters of the stars and the results obtained by us were examined using Benford’s law (Benford 1938). This
was done to check whether the data and the results are uniformly and randomly distributed. The tests show that the
catalog data are not similar to the Benford distribution. The results obtained by us, such as the duration of the ﬂares’
or estimated ﬂares energy, are consistent with Benford’s law.

All stars observed by TESS with given luminosity and eﬀective temperature were marked as light gray dots on the
Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram (Figure 6). The ﬂaring stars with known luminosities, eﬀective temperatures, and
log(g) observed in sectors 01-39 are marked with colors. The ﬂaring stars with estimated luminosity and no log(g) are
marked in dark gray. The luminosity of the star was estimated from the stellar radius and the eﬀective temperature.
On the right, there is the colorbar of stellar log(g). The log(g) values of the ﬂaring stars range from 3.3 to 5.1. Solid
black lines represent the evolutionary tracks of stars with an initial mass of 0.5, 1, and 2 solar masses. Most of the
ﬂaring stars that we found are in the main-sequence, but we detected ﬂares on young stars and giants as well. To
estimate the age of the star we use catalog data from SIMBAD. We consider an object as a young if the star is classiﬁed
as a pre main-sequence, a young stellar object, T Tauri, or Wolf-Rayet star. The energies of the ﬂares on young stars
range from 8 × 1031 to 4 × 1035 erg. We compared the estimations of the energy of several super-ﬂares on young stars
with that in Feinstein et al. (2020). For example, we determined the ﬂare energy on TIC44678751 to be 2 × 1035 erg
and Feinstein et al. (2020) to be 2 × 1037 erg. There are similar big diﬀerences for other events, but we are not able to
clearly state what they may result from. The two orders of magnitude diﬀerence cannot be explained only by assumed
ﬂare temperatures (10,000 K in our case and 9,000 K in Feinstein et al. (2020)). The temperatures of the ﬂaring stars
mostly do not exceed 8,000 K, but we found a few stars with higher eﬀective temperatures.

Figure 6. H-R diagram for all stars observed by TESS (light gray dots) and the ﬂaring stars from sectors 01-39 with known
luminosities and eﬀective temperatures (colored dots). The ﬂaring stars with estimated luminosities are marked in dark gray.
On the right, there is the colorbar of stellar log(g). The black lines show the evolutionary tracks of stars with initial masses of
0.5, 1 and 2 masses of the sun.

The results from our work (marked in blue in Figure 7, 8, 9, 10) were compared with works such as Doyle et al.
(2020), Feinstein et al. (2020), G¨unther et al. (2020). However, there are some diﬀerences in the sample selection
between that works and our research.
In Doyle et al. (2020) authors researched a solar-type stars with measured
rotation periods observed in TESS sectors 1-13. G¨unther et al. (2020) was analyzing ﬂares at all 2-minute cadence
stars only in TESS sectors 1 and 2. Feinstein et al. (2020) was looking at only young stars in sectors 1-20. Figures 7
and 8 show histograms of the number of ﬂaring stars compared with results from G¨unther et al. (2020) and Feinstein
et al. (2020) presented as a function of the stellar eﬀective temperature. To make the comparison, we selected all the

12

stars from G¨unther et al. (2020) form Table 2, that have estimated the eﬀective temperature. The software prepared
by us found more ﬂaring stars in sectors 1 and 2 than in G¨unther et al. (2020), mainly due to diﬀerent methods of
searching for ﬂares. In both samples there are 963 ﬂaring stars with the same TIC number and 7837 ﬂares were found
by both pipelines. However, it should be noted that our software analyzes only events that have at least six observation
points. The eﬀective temperature of ﬂaring stars distribution ﬁts nicely. Using the χ2 goodness-of-ﬁt test between two
distributions we obtain the value of about 0.90. There is no reason to reject the hypothesis at the 0.05 signiﬁcance
level. Compared to the Feinstein et al. (2020) (Figure 8), the temperature distributions of ﬂaring stars are similar up
to 8,000 K (χ2 goodness-of-ﬁt test value is about 0.93). We also chose the same sample that was presented by the
authors in their work. The eﬀective temperatures of most ﬂaring stars that we have found are limited to this value
due to the assumptions described earlier. There is a large diﬀerence in both samples’ sizes, therefore on the vertical
axis is a relative number of stars.

with the total number of stars in the TESS two-min cadence

two-min cadence by TESS in sectors 1-20 (S01-S20). Com-
parison of our results and Feinstein et al. (2020).

Figure 9 shows a spread in spectral types within solar-type star samples from our work and Doyle et al. (2020)
(observations from sectors 1-13). Again, the relative number of stars can be found on the vertical axis. The diﬀerence
in numbers of stars is due to the sample selected in Doyle et al. (2020), where the spot modulation was searched for.
The diﬀerent distribution of the spectral types of ﬂaring stars may result from the diﬀerent methods of searching for
ﬂares used. In Doyle et al. (2020) the sample of the studied stars was small enough to check visually each light curve,
while our detections are mainly from using the automated software WARPFINDER.

In Figure 10 we compare the distributions of TESS magnitudes within the ﬂaring stars observed in sectors 1-20
from our work and Feinstein et al. (2020). As in Figure 8, slight diﬀerences in the TESS magnitude distribution are
probably caused by the diﬀerent methods of detecting ﬂares used and limitations of the stellar age up to 800 Myr.

4.2. Parameters of stellar ﬂares

Light curves of the detected ﬂares were ﬁtted with one of three types of proﬁles presented in the description of the
ﬂare proﬁle method. We used the single proﬁle, double with the same value of B and double with the diﬀerent value
of B. More than half of the events ﬁtted well with only the single proﬁle. In other cases two proﬁles were needed for
a good ﬁt of a single ﬂare. In this analysis, we did not handle the problem of ﬁtting two or more overlapping events.
The overlapping events do not ﬁt well by the proﬁle we are using (Equations 1, 2, 3), so the χ2 value is too high. For
this reason, they are automatically rejected from the analysis. Based on the well-ﬁtted ﬂares (the value of the reduced
χ2 less than 3.0), we reconstructed three types of average proﬁles as a function of full-time width at half the maximum
ﬂux (t1/2) (Figure 11, Figure 12). All ﬂares were previously scaled to a relative time and amplitude. We then ﬁtted
the parameters A, B, C, and D of the obtained average proﬁles (Table 2). A similar method was used in Kowalski
et al. (2013) and Davenport et al. (2014). The distribution of the values of the reduced χ2 for the analyzed stellar
ﬂares is shown in Figure 13.

The proﬁles diﬀer in the average growth time (parameters B and C) and the decay time (parameter D). Longer and
stronger events are usually ﬁtted with two proﬁles. One of these proﬁles is supposed to be related to the direct heating

of the photosphere by non-thermal electrons. It is characterized by very short growth and decay times (parameters B,
C and D). The second one, longer (with signiﬁcantly lower parameter D) may be the result of back-warming processes
(Isobe et al. 2007). It can be noticed that the contribution of the second component is particularly important for a
proﬁle with one B parameter. In both double proﬁles, the second component dominates in the decay phase.

The ﬂare proﬁles that we obtained were compared with the ﬂare model form Davenport et al. (2014), which is the
result of the analysis of ﬂares observed with Kepler on the M4 star GJ 1243. Figure 11 (right) shows our three proﬁles
marked with black, blue and green, and the reconstructed model of a ﬂare proposed by Davenport et al. (2014) (red).
This analytic model was forced to go through 0 at t1/2 = −1 and 1 at t1/2 = 0. The large diﬀerences between the
proﬁles at the decay phase (t1/2 > 2) may be related to diﬀerent methods of determining the end times of stellar ﬂares.

Figure 13. The distribution of the values of the reduced χ2 for the analyzed stellar ﬂares.

We examined the distribution of the basic parameters of stellar ﬂares. Figure 14 shows the distributions of ﬂare
amplitudes, durations, and times of growth and decay. The amplitudes of most of the detected events do not exceed
the value of 0.1 of the normalized ﬂux, however, there are ﬂares with amplitudes equal even several times the brightness
of the star. The maximum of the all ﬂares’ durations distribution is approximately 50 minutes. The ﬂares ﬁtted with
two proﬁles are characterized by a longer average duration. In this work, we limited the minimum of a ﬂare duration
to six data points (12 minutes). The longest observed events last up to several hours. Most of the detections with a
duration of more than 500 minutes were false, so we did not include them in further analysis. The average values of
the growth times are much shorter than the decay times and are usually below 20 minutes. Examples of ﬂares of long
durations, times of growth or decay are listed in Table 3.

Another result of the performed calculations is the estimation of energy of most stellar ﬂares. Figure 15 shows the
cumulative energy distribution estimated using both of the previously discussed methods based on Shibayama et al.
(2013) (named v1, dark blue in Figures 15, 17, 20) and Kov´ari et al. (2007) (named v2, light blue in Figures 15, 17,
20). Stars that have energies estimated by both methods must have such parameters as: radius, eﬀective temperature,
and log(g). The sample of ﬂares that have energy estimated only by the ﬁrst method is larger by about 3,000 ﬂares,
because the log(g) is not necessary then. The index of power-law approximation is about 1.68 fort the method based
on Shibayama et al. (2013) and about 1.65 for the method based on Kov´ari et al. (2007) in the ﬂare energy from
5 × 1033 to 1036 erg. These results are in agreement with the previous papers (Lacy et al. 1976; Hawley et al. 2014;
Maehara et al. 2020). The ﬂare frequency distributions (FFDs) of stars binned by the ﬂare amplitude are presented
in Figure 16. We examined how the slopes of the distributions vary for three samples. One of them was stars with
masses less than 0.3 M(cid:12) (violet), second one with masses in between 0.3 M(cid:12) and 0.5 M(cid:12) (blue), and the other with
masses greater than 0.5 M(cid:12) (beige). The slope values of the distributions are very similar to those in other works and
is about -1.4 ((Feinstein et al. 2020; Feinstein et al. 2022). It can be seen that a sample of stars with lower masses also
has a shallower slope. The diﬀerences in slopes can be explained by theoretical works (Seligman et al. 2022).

Figure 17 shows the histogram of ﬂares’ energies. It could be noticed that the results obtained with the ﬁrst method
(Shibayama et al. 2013) are larger than those obtained with the second method (Kov´ari et al. 2007). The estimated
energies of stellar ﬂares range from 1031 to 5 × 1036 erg, which means that most of the detected events are super-ﬂares.
Figure 3 additionally shows the dependence between ﬂares’ energies estimated using the method based on Shibayama
et al. (2013) (v1) and based on Kov´ari et al. (2007) (v2). Our results were compared with the works: Doyle et al.
(2020), G¨unther et al. (2020), Howard et al. (2019). These studies also investigated stellar ﬂares observed by the
TESS satellite. The comparison shows that our results agree with the already known average energy of the detected
stellar ﬂares. Figure 19 shows the diﬀerences between the energy distribution of ﬂares ﬁtted with one or two proﬁles.
Based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test we reject the hypothesis of the same distributions. The ﬂares with the highest
energies (greater than 1035 erg) are usually ﬁtted with two proﬁles.

Figure 20 shows the ﬂare energies distribution calculated in our work and that from Doyle et al. (2020). The energy
ranges from 1032 to 1036 erg and the maximum of the distribution from Doyle et al. (2020) is for energies about four
times higher than in our work. This is due to the fact that we have modiﬁed the method of estimating the energy
of the ﬂares described in Kov´ari et al. (2007). The ﬂare energies obtained in our sample are very similar to those in
G¨unther et al. (2020) (Figure 21). Small diﬀerences could be attributed to diﬀerent methods of searching for stellar
ﬂares used. Moreover, in G¨unther et al. (2020) ﬂares of shorter duration (from six minutes) than in our work were
included. Figure 22 shows another comparison. Howard et al. (2019) estimated ﬂare energies based on the TESS
observations in sectors 1-6 and the Evryscope. The average energy of the ﬂares from both datasets is signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent. The authors explain that TESS observed much fainter, lower amplitude events. Our estimations are similar
to the energies obtained by other authors from the observations from TESS. Based on all presented results, it can be
seen that the energy of stellar ﬂares varies from 1031 erg to 1036 erg, depending on the analyzed star sample.

Table 4 additionally summarizes information about the stars with the most energetic ﬂares found by our software.
Among the super-ﬂares listed here, we found only one that was already mentioned in other works. We estimated the
energy of the ﬂare on the TIC79358659 at 1035.88 erg, and in Doyle et al. (2020) at 1035.72 erg. We would like to notice
the systematic overestimation of the ﬂare energy is caused by too large estimates of the stellar radius from the MAST
catalog. In the analyzed sample of stars, there were objects classiﬁed as main-sequence stars, but with a radius of
several or a dozen solar radii. For this reason, we limited our analysis only to stars with a radius smaller than 2 R(cid:12).
Examples of super-ﬂares on TIC175305230 and TIC232036408 stars with ﬁtted proﬁles are shown in Figures 23 and
24. The ﬂares were ﬁtted with two proﬁles with one B. Assuming that the bolometric energy of 1033 erg corresponds
to an SXR scale X100 ﬂare (Benz 2016), the detected events are more energetic than X100000 ﬂares.

Using the energy estimation method proposed in Shibayama et al. (2013), it is also possible to determine the areas
of stellar ﬂares (Equation 7). Figure 25 shows a distribution of the areas of the ﬂares obtained in our research in
parts per million of a stellar disc [ppm]. All ﬂares are marked with gray, ﬂares ﬁtted with one proﬁle with black, two
proﬁles with one B with blue, and two proﬁles with B1 and B2 with red. The maximum of each of the distributions
is about 2200 ppm. Based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test we rejected the hypothesis of the same distributions. For
the ﬁt with one proﬁle, the average value of the ﬂares areas is 0.31% of the entire stellar disk, and for the ﬁts with
one and two B parameters it is 0.35% and 0.27% respectively. Flares ﬁtted with two proﬁles with one B parameter
are characterized by on average larger areas than other ﬂares. Our results are in line with the general knowledge of
the areas of solar and stellar ﬂares observed in white light Heinzel & Shibata (2018).

a stellar disc [ppm]. All ﬂares are marked with gray, ﬂares ﬁtted with one

An analysis similar to that in Namekata et al. (2017) or Tu et al. (2021) was also carried out in our work. These
authors compare the durations and energies of the ﬂares observed on the Sun and other solar-like stars. Based on the
scaling laws, they estimated the magnetic ﬁeld strengths and the lengths of the ﬂares loops. The authors assume a
constant pre-ﬂare coronal density. Other versions of the scaling laws, in which the coronal density changes with the
length of the ﬂare loop, have also been proposed. Moreover, the coronal density of very active stars may be much
greater than the solar coronal density. This can be concluded from their short rotation periods and the emission in
the X-ray range. Therefore, the obtained results are only estimates of the strength of magnetic ﬁelds and the lengths
of the ﬂare loops. Scaling laws used in this work are given by the following equations (Namekata et al. 2017):

τ ∝ E1/3B−5/3

τ ∝ E−1/2L5/2

(13)

(14)

where τ is the ﬂare duration time, E is the estimated ﬂare energy, B is the magnetic ﬁeld strength, and L is the
length of the ﬂare loop. Figure 26 shows the observed relations between ﬂare energy and duration from our sample of
stars. On this graph, we have plotted theoretical lines for the diﬀerent strength of magnetic ﬁelds (30, 60, 200, 400 G)
and the lenghts of the ﬂare loops (1010 cm, 1011 cm). The upper panel shows ﬂares ﬁtted with one proﬁle, the middle

location of the center of mass with its coordinates is marked with red. The centers of mass shifted towards greater
ﬂare energies and longer durations. Moreover, the crosses marked in blue mean the average energy of the ﬂares in a
given range of their duration (10-30 minutes, 30-50 minutes, etc.). The linear ﬁt to these points with their parameters
is also marked in blue. The slope of the line changes from 0.49 to 0.46 for the ﬂares ﬁtted with diﬀerent proﬁles.

strength of magnetic ﬁelds and the lengths of the ﬂare loops. A constant pre-ﬂare coronal density is assumed. On
the panel a) there are marked ﬂares ﬁtted with one proﬁle, on the panel b) ﬂares ﬁtted with two proﬁles with one
B and on c) ﬁtted with two proﬁles with B1 and B2. Discrete ﬂare durations bins result from the time resolution
of observations equal to 2 minutes. In each case, the red color shows the location of the center of mass with its
coordinates. The blue color shows a linear ﬁt to the data. More information is in the text.

22

For ﬂares ﬁtted with two proﬁles, the dependence between the ﬂare energy and the duration is stronger. Flares for
which it is necessary to distinguish two components of the proﬁle are usually stronger, longer, and more complicated.
We assume that there are two mechanisms in such ﬂares: direct heating of the photosphere with non-thermal electrons
and back-warming processes. We assume that there are two mechanisms in such ﬂares: direct heating of the photosphere
with non-thermal electrons and back-warming processes which are of thermal origin. For example, observations of ﬂares
on the AU Mic star with the FUSE (Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explores) satellite shows an increasing continuum
ﬂux to shorter wavelengths, which can be interpreted as free-free emission for hot plasma (Redﬁeld et al. 2002). Our
results are similar to those from Namekata et al. (2017). The estimated energies and the durations of the ﬂares agree
very well with the analogous values for the super-ﬂares observed by Kepler with a 30-minute cadence. The high
values of magnetic ﬁeld strengths up to 400 G determined by the scaling laws are characteristic for shorter super-ﬂares
observed by Kepler with a cadence of 1 minute.

We assume a constant pre-ﬂare coronal density. Using information about the ﬂares’ durations and its energies we
calculated magnetic ﬁeld strengths and ﬂare loop lengths. The average values of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths are from
10 G to 200 G. The estimated lengths of the ﬂare loops are from 1010 cm to 2 × 1011 cm. These values correspond to
even several radii of a given star (Figure 27). It could be concluded that the single-loop assumption is not suﬃcient
for most of the observed ﬂares. Stellar ﬂares are probably associated with several or more ﬂare loops. This conclusion
should be correct taking into account the observations of strong events occurring on the Sun (Aschwanden et al. 2007).

and stellar radius.

5. DISCUSSIONS

We analyzed the ﬁrst 39 sectors of TESS satellite data (about 330,000 stars). More than 140,000 ﬂares were detected
on over 25,000 stars. The ﬂaring stars that we found make up about 7.7% of the entire data sample. This value varies
greatly depending on the eﬀective temperature or the spectral type of a star. Most of found ﬂaring stars are in the
main-sequence, but we detected ﬂares on young stars and giants as well. The eﬀective temperatures for most of ﬂaring
stars do not exceed 8,000 K. The percentage of ﬂaring stars could be even greater than 50% for the stars of spectral
type M.

Pietras et al. 2022

23

In total, during the ﬁrst year of TESS observations (S01-S13, ecliptic declination from -90◦ to -54◦), we found 9480
ﬂaring stars. For comparison, during the third year of the mission, when the southern hemisphere was re-observed
(S27-S39), we found 10661 ﬂaring stars, including 8913 new objects.

In our work, we used three types of ﬂare proﬁles: single, double with one B, and double with B1 and B2. A
single proﬁle was suﬃcient for more than half of the events. The maximum of the all ﬂares duration distribution is
approximately 50 minutes. The ﬂares ﬁtted with two proﬁles are characterized by an average longer duration. The
average value of the durations of ﬂares ﬁtted with one proﬁle is 66 minutes, and with two proﬁles is 98 minutes. The
longest observed events last up to several hours. The average values of the growth times are much shorter than the
decay times and are usually below 10 minutes.

Usually longer and stronger events are ﬁtted with two proﬁles. One of these proﬁles is supposed to be related to
the direct heating of the photosphere by non-thermal electrons. It is characterized by very short growth and decay
times (parameters B, C and D). The second one, longer (with signiﬁcantly lower parameter D) may be the result of
back-warming processes (Isobe et al. 2007). In both double proﬁles, the second component dominates, especially in
the decay phase.

We also estimated the energies of stellar ﬂares based on two diﬀerent methods (Shibayama et al. (2013) and modiﬁed
Kov´ari et al. (2007)). In the ﬁrst method, we assumed a ﬂare temperature of 10000 K, while in the second method no
such assumption was needed. In most cases, the energy calculated using the stellar spectrum gives lower values. This
is due to the fact that the energy estimated in this way is not bolometric energy. Estimated energies of stellar ﬂares
range from 1031 to 1036 erg, which means that most of the detected events are super-ﬂares. Our results were compared
with the works: Doyle et al. (2020), G¨unther et al. (2020), Howard et al. (2019). Obtained ﬂare energies are very
similar in our sample and G¨unther et al. (2020) (Figure 21). Small diﬀerences could be caused by diﬀerent methods of
searching for stellar ﬂares. Moreover, in G¨unther et al. (2020) ﬂares of shorter duration (from six minutes) than in our
work were included. Our estimations are similar to the energies obtained from TESS observations by other authors.
The index of power-law approximation at the cumulative distribution of the ﬂare energies (Figure 15) is about 1.7 for
the method based on Shibayama et al. (2013) and about 1.5 for the method based on Kov´ari et al. (2007) in the ﬂare
energy from 5 × 1033 to 1036 erg. These results are in agreement with previous papers (Lacy et al. 1976; Hawley et al.
2014; Maehara et al. 2020).

Using the energy estimation method from Shibayama et al. (2013), it is also possible to determine the area of stellar
ﬂares. The maximum of this distribution for all ﬂares is about 2200 ppm (0.22%) (Figure 25). Flares ﬁtted with
two proﬁles with one B parameter are characterized by on average larger areas than other ﬂares. For the ﬁt with
one proﬁle, the average value of the ﬂares’ areas is 0.31% of the entire stellar disk and for ﬁts with one and two B
parameters it is 0.35% and 0.27% respectively. Our results are in line with the general knowledge of the areas of solar
and stellar ﬂares observed in white light Heinzel & Shibata (2018).

The index of power-law approximation of the relation between ﬂare energy and duration changes from 0.49 to 0.46 for
the ﬂares ﬁtted with diﬀerent proﬁles (Figure 26). For the ﬂares ﬁtted with two proﬁles, the dependence between the
ﬂare energy and the duration is stronger. Flares for which it is necessary to distinguish two components of the proﬁle
are usually stronger, longer, and more complicated. Our results are similar to those from Namekata et al. (2017).
The estimated energies and the duration of the ﬂares agree very well with the analogous values for the super-ﬂares
observed by Kepler with a 30-minute cadence. The high values of magnetic ﬁeld strengths up to 400 G determined by
the scaling laws are characteristic for shorter super-ﬂares observed by Kepler with a cadence of 1 minute. On the basis
of the relationship between the length of the ﬂare loops and the radius of the star (Figure 27), it could be concluded
that the single-loop assumption is not suﬃcient for most of the observed ﬂares. It looks as if stellar ﬂares are probably
associated with several or more ﬂare loops. This conclusion should be correct taking into account the observations of
events occurring on the Sun.

Flares detected on cool stars have, on average, higher amplitudes due to the greater contrast between the ﬂares’ and
the star’s surface. Such an eﬀect has already been noted in other studies analyzing stellar ﬂares (Jackman et al. 2021).
Figure 28 shows the relation between the logarithm of the amplitude of the ﬂares and the logarithm of the eﬀective
temperature of the stars. The linear ﬁt to this data and the linear model parameters are shown in blue. The linear
model parameters are shown in the upper right corner. The big amplitude of the ﬂare is not always related to the high
energy emitted during its duration. For this reason, it is important to use methods to estimate the energy of stellar
ﬂares. Our results are consistent with previous studies on the topic based on the observations of TESS and Kepler.

The linear ﬁt and its parameters are marked in blue.

An analysis of white-light stellar ﬂares is important in understanding heating and emission processes during stellar
ﬂares. Since the mechanisms of continuum emission can be diﬀerent from the mechanisms of spectral lines formation,
observation of white-light ﬂares can give us an additional constraint, allowing more precise spatial and temporal
localization of heating, cooling, and energy transportation processes.
