ABSTRACT

Abell 1689 is a well studied cluster of galaxies and one of the largest gravitational lens systems ever observed. We have obtained
a reconstruction of the cluster Abell 1689 using Grale, a free-form lens inversion method that relies exclusively on the multiple
image data. Non-inclusion of any data related to cluster member galaxies ensures an unbiased measure of the mass distribution,
which is the most notable feature of this method. We used two diÔ¨Äerent sets of multiply lensed systems from the available
strong lensing data - one containing only the secure systems (107 images), and the other containing all available systems, only
excluding some very non-secure systems (151 images). Both the reconstructions produced similar mass distributions whose
circularly symmetric radial proÔ¨Åles are well Ô¨Åt with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) proÔ¨Åle with concentration parameter
values, ùëê ‚àº 6.8. For the very well-constrained central ‚àº100 kpc region of the cluster we made detailed comparison of the Grale
reconstructed lensing mass and stellar mass retrieved by the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) Ô¨Åtting software fast++. We
found an oÔ¨Äset in the light peak of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and its associated lensing mass peak, of about 10 kpc. We
also found a light-unaccompanied mass peak in this region, whose location agrees with features retrieved by some of the earlier
reconstructions using diÔ¨Äerent methodologies. Both the light-unaccompanied mass peak and the BCG oÔ¨Äset are consistent with
dark matter self-interaction cross-section ùúé (cid:46) 1cm2/g, while the mass peak is in tension with larger cross-sections.

1 INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters are the most recently formed gravitationally bound
structures in the hierarchical structure formation in ŒõCDM (Lambda
Cold Dark Matter) model of cosmology. Galaxy clusters contain
hundreds of galaxies and X-ray emitting hot intracluster plasma, but
their mass budget is dominated by dark matter. The mass distribution
within a galaxy cluster can be measured through several physical
processes such as kinematics of member galaxies (e.g., Saro et al.
2013; Rines et al. 2022), the hydrodynamics of the hot X-ray gas (e.g.,
Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Ettori et al. 2013), and gravitational lensing.

The strong lensing eÔ¨Äect is most powerful in the central regions
(cid:46) 0.3 Mpc of galaxy clusters, which contain high concentrations of
both baryonic and dark matter, and often produce high density of mul-
tiple images. These central regions serve as cosmic laboratories for
studying the interplay between baryonic and dark matter. In the cur-
rent ŒõCDM model of cosmology, dark matter is assumed to be cold
and collisionless. However, if dark matter exhibits self-interaction it
is highly likely that the resulting eÔ¨Äects will be exhibited in the cen-
tral dense regions of clusters (Kneib & Natarajan 2011). For example,
self-interaction can result in oÔ¨Äsets between galaxies and their dark

matter halos (Harvey et al. 2019), or erase small scale mass features,
like central density cusps. In recent times, strong gravitational lens-
ing by galaxy clusters has been extraordinarily useful for the study
of the high redshift universe (Lotz et al. 2017; Bouwens et al. 2017;
Livermore et al. 2017; Ishigaki et al. 2018), as clusters can mag-
nify faint distant background sources with Ô¨Åxed surface brightness,
by increasing their angular extent, and hence observed Ô¨Çuxes, thus
pushing the sources above the detection threshold of contemporary
telescopes (Schneider et al. 1992; Bartelmann 2010). Multiple im-
ages produced through strong lensing by individual cluster member
galaxies are also currently detectable in the deepest Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) observations (Meneghetti et al. 2020).

These studies rely on the mass distributions within the clusters,
which are made possible by lens reconstruction algorithms. Sev-
eral lens reconstruction techniques have been developed and widely
tested within the lensing community over the last few decades (see for
example, Meneghetti et al. 2017). These techniques predominantly
use the strongly lensed multiple images, but some also incorporate
weak lensing data in their analysis. The number of observed strongly
lensed multiple images in a galaxy cluster depends on the depth of the
observations, the source number density behind the cluster, and the
cluster redshift. The maximum number of observed strongly lensed
images in a galaxy cluster is currently in the order of ‚àº 100, which is
insuÔ¨Écient to break all possible lensing degeneracies (Liesenborgs

A. Ghosh et al.

& De Rƒ≥cke 2012; Ghosh et al. 2020). This leads to diÔ¨Äerent re-
construction techniques producing non-unique solutions (Limousin
et al. 2016; Priewe et al. 2017). However, with the inception of the
Hubble Frontier Fields survey (HFF; PI: J. Lotz) with the HST, it
has become possible to estimate systematic uncertainties based on
diÔ¨Äerent reconstructions of the same clusters of galaxies (Lotz et al.
2017).

Reconstruction techniques can be broadly classiÔ¨Åed into two cat-
egories: simply parametrized and free-form. Simply-parametrized
methods, which are widely used, assign simple mass proÔ¨Åles to clus-
ter galaxies, like Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW; Navarro et al. 1996),
Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical Mass Distributions (PIEMD; Kassiola
& Kovner 1993), pseudo-JaÔ¨Äe distributions (PJ; Keeton 2001). The
cluster-scale dark matter distribution is represented by the same or
similar proÔ¨Åles, but with larger scale lengths.

In contrast to parametric models, free-form methods, such as
Grale (Liesenborgs et al. 2006, 2020), do not assume any rela-
tion between the distribution of mass and light. The advantage of
free-form methods is that they use the lensed images only, avoid-
ing the use of strong priors of simply-parametrized methods. While
simply-parametrized priors are astrophysically motivated, they de-
scribe the average properties of galaxies and clusters, and may fail
to correctly capture the mass distribution, especially in merging and
non fully equilibrium clusters. Because of their high sensitivity to
lensed images, free-form methods can detect cluster mass features
that elude parametric methods (Ghosh et al. 2021).

Abell 1689 (hereafter A1689) is a well studied cluster of galaxies
and one of the largest gravitational lens systems ever observed, owing
to its large mass. It is one of the earliest clusters to be revealed
with more than ‚àº 100 multiple images from 30 sources (Broadhurst
et al. 2005). This was a giant leap forward in the number of strong
lensing constraints for a given cluster in pre-HFF era. A1689 has been
modelled by a number of mass modeling groups using parametric
methods (Broadhurst et al. 2005; Zekser et al. 2006; Halkola et al.
2006; Limousin et al. 2007), free-form methods (Coe et al. 2010;
Mohammed et al. 2014; Cha & Jee 2022), and hybrid methods (Diego
et al. 2005, 2015) using only strong lensing data or a combination
of both strong and weak data. The number and quality of multiple
images have increased with the discovery of new systems and updates
to the existing systems with spectroscopic redshifts (Limousin et al.
2007; Coe et al. 2010; Diego et al. 2015; Bina et al. 2016; Alavi et al.
2016).

A1689 appears roughly circularly symmetric on the sky, and is
likely in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is a cool core cluster, with a rea-
sonably good agreement between its weak lensing mass and X-ray
mass within ‚àº 0.9Mpc (Riemer-S√∏rensen et al. 2009). The mass
proÔ¨Åle of A1689 agrees well with the standard Navarro, Frenk and
White (NFW) Ô¨Åtting formula proÔ¨Åle, consistent with the ŒõCDM cos-
mology but with a high concentration (ùëê = 6 ‚àí 11; see table 2 of Coe
et al. 2010). DuÔ¨Äy et al. (2008) estimated the NFW concentration
value for clusters of similar mass from three N-body simulations to
be ùëê = 3 ‚àí 4 which is roughly the same as estimated by Umetsu &
Diemer (2017) from observations of a large sample of clusters of
similar mass. Peng et al. (2009) combined weak-lensing and X-ray
data from the Chandra satellite and found a discrepancy between the
hydrostatic mass from X-ray data and lensing masses. They attributed
this discrepancy to projection eÔ¨Äects. In agreement with this conclu-
sion, Sereno et al. (2013), using X-ray and Sunyaev‚ÄìZel‚Äôdovich (SZ)
measurements found that the cluster has a triaxial shape elongated
along the line of sight. The multi-probe analysis by Umetsu et al.
(2015) using strong and weak lensing along with X-ray and SZ data
also favored a triaxial geometry for A1689.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì10 (2021)

In this paper we focus on two aspects of our reconstructed mass
distribution of A1689, that relate to the properties of dark matter:
the global, radially averaged density proÔ¨Åle of the cluster, and the
detailed comparison between the stellar light and mass density vs.
the total density in the central ‚àº100 kpc region, that contain 4 massive
ellipticals. The comparison between stellar mass and total mass can
reveal particle nature of dark matter, speciÔ¨Åcally, its self-interaction
cross section.

The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we provide details
of the HST imaging and the observed strong lensed multiple images
for A1689. In Section 3, we discuss the details of the reconstruction
algorithm Grale and the results obtained from the mass reconstruc-
tions. In Section 4.1, we discuss the Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED) Ô¨Åtting software fast++ which we use to obtain the stellar
mass distribution in the central ‚àº 100 region of the cluster, and in
Section 4.2 we compare between the stellar mass and the lensing
mass. Finally, we draw our conclusions with further discussions on
the results in Section 5.

Throughout this work we used the ŒõCDM model of cosmology:
Ô¨Çat, with matter density, Œ©ùëö = 0.3, cosmological constant density,
Œ©Œõ = 0.7, and the dimensionless Hubble constant ‚Ñé = 0.7. The
redshift of A1689 is, ùëßùëô = 0.1832. The center of the reconstruction
region is at R.A.= 197.873‚ó¶, Dec.= ‚àí1.338‚ó¶. At the redshift of the
cluster, 1 arcsec corresponds to 3.08 kpc.

2 DATA

2.1 HST Data

In this paper, we use public imaging data from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). A1689 has been observed with Advanced Camera
for Surveys Wide Field Channel (ACS/WFC; Ryon 2022) in four
optical bandpasses (F475W, F625W, F775W, and F850LP) as part
of the HST program ID 9289 (PI: H. Ford), taken in Cycle 11 in
June 2002 and in the F814W optical bandpass as part of the HST
program ID 11710 (PI: J. Blakeslee), taken in Cycle 17 in May to
July 2010; and in three Wide Field Camera 3 Ultraviolet and VISible
light (WFC3/UVIS; Dressel 2022) bandpasses (F225W, F275W, and
F336W) as part of program IDs 12201 and 12931 (PI: B. Siana),
taken in Cycle 18 in December 2010 and Cycle 20 in February and
March 2012, respectively. More details on the data calibration and
reduction can be found in Alavi et al. (2014, 2016). The images are
all mapped to the same pixel scale of 80 mas pixel‚àí1.

2.2 Lensing Data

Strongly lensed multiply imaged systems in A1689 can be found in
the existing literature (Broadhurst et al. 2005; Halkola et al. 2006;
Limousin et al. 2007; Coe et al. 2010; Diego et al. 2015). A com-
pilation of the lensed images is provided in Table A1. For system
identiÔ¨Åcation we maintained the notation used in Diego et al. (2015)
(see their appendix A). In addition to the images listed in Diego et al.
(2015, 2018) we have also added two new multiply imaged systems
identiÔ¨Åed by Bina et al. (2016) as system 62 and 63, and Ô¨Åve new
multiply imaged systems identiÔ¨Åed by Alavi et al. (2016) as systems
64 ‚àí 68 in Table A1, for completeness. Systems 1, 4, 7, 8, 17, 46 and
50 are also updated with spectroscopic redshifts from the Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE; Bina et al. 2016). These observed
strongly lensed multiple images are shown in Figure 1 overlaid on
the ACS/F814W mosaic.

3 LENS RECONSTRUCTION

3.1 Method: Strong Lens Reconstruction Using Grale

The lens inversion method used in this paper is based on the recon-
struction code Grale1. The publicly available Grale software im-
plements a Ô¨Çexible, free-form, adaptive grid lens inversion method,
based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) as the underly-
ing optimization procedure (Liesenborgs et al. 2006, 2007, 2020).
Grale uses only multiple lensed image locations and their redshifts
as input. It is ideally suited for reconstructions with numerous multi-
ple images, available with HST data. The fact that the number of its
model parameters exceeds the number of data constraints allows a
fuller exploration of degenerate mass distributions (Mohammed et al.
2014; Sebesta et al. 2016, 2019; Meneghetti et al. 2017; Williams
et al. 2018; Williams & Liesenborgs 2019; Ghosh et al. 2020, 2021).
We refer the readers to see section 3.1 of Ghosh et al. (2020, here-
after, G20), for a concise description of the modus operandi of Grale.
In short, Grale‚Äôs mass basis set consists of hundreds of projected
Plummer spheres, each occupying a grid cell in the lens plane. A run
starts with a uniform grid made up of a small number of grid cells
of equal size. As the code runs the grid is reÔ¨Åned, especially in areas
of high density. At each iteration, the code optimizes the Plummer
masses to produce overlapping images when projected back onto the

1 Grale is publicly available. For the software and tutorials visit https:
//research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/grale2/

source plane. The Ô¨Ånal map has a few thousand grid cells ranging
from 1.32 to 42.5 arcsec, each occupied by a Plummer proportional
to the cell width, and mass determined by the genetic algorithm.
The angular resolution of the reconstruction is set by the smallest
Plummer.

3.2 Input: Multiple Image Data

Many multiple images are available for A1689, but not all are of the
same quality. For example, spectroscopic redshifts are more precise
and accurate compared to photometric ones. Since Grale uses only
the strongly lensed multiple image data, with no priors about the
cluster member galaxies, it is particularly sensitive to the quality of
the lensed image data. Therefore we select lensed images of higher
quality.

As mentioned by Diego et al. (2015) systems 25 and 32 con-
tain multiple candidates for some of the counter-images, and sys-
tems 20, 25, 26 and 27 have shown diÔ¨Äerent colors between diÔ¨Äerent
counter-images with the inclusion of the IR data by Diego et al.
(2015); these systems thus were not used in our work. We used the
updated re-matching of the systems 10 and 12 by Diego et al. (2015)
based on IR data (see their section 3 for more details about these
systems). We have also excluded the three systems 13, 14 and 30:
since they do not have counterparts on the opposite side of the cluster,
they can only constrain mass in their small immediate vicinity, and
are therefore not good candidates for Grale.

For the reconstructions performed in this work we have used two

images from 31 sources in this set - 24 of these systems have spec-

includes all the available images except the already excluded sys-
tems, and the systems 64 ‚àí 68 identiÔ¨Åed by Alavi et al. (2016), (the
‚ÄòALL-reconstruction‚Äô) since they are not very secure because they
have inconsistent photometric redshifts, whereas Grale requires all
lensed images from the same source to have the same redshift. There
are a total of 151 images from 47 sources in this set - 24 of these sys-
tems have spectroscopic redshifts and 23 have photometric redshifts.

of the cluster beyond 200 kpc. A similar, but smaller extension ap-
pears to be present in reconstructions presented in Limousin et al.
(2007) and Cha & Jee (2022).

Since the overall mass distribution is approximately circularly
symmetric, we compute the circularly averaged density proÔ¨Åles for
each reconstruction, centered on the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG).
These are shown in Figure 4. It is clear that both have very similar
radial proÔ¨Åles. The bump around 50 arcsec is due to the presence
of the outer mass clump, described above, to the north east of the
cluster center. Fitting NFW proÔ¨Åles yielded a concentration param-
eter of ùëê = 6.88 ¬± 0.44 and a scale radius of ùëÖS = 145.6 ¬± 26.7
arcsec for the S-reconstruction, and a concentration parameter of
ùëê = 6.86 ¬± 0.45 and a scale radius of ùëÖS = 147.6 ¬± 27.6 arcsec for the
ALL-reconstruction. These values are consistent with other studies
(see table 2 of Coe et al. 2010). As in previous works, NFW provides
a good Ô¨Åt to the strong lensing data over the available radial range:
‚àº 1.3 decades in radius. Unfortunately, this relatively short radial
range and the presence of signiÔ¨Åcant mass clumps does not allow
to diÔ¨Äerentiate between various theoretical models of dark matter
proÔ¨Åles, as was done in Beraldo e Silva et al. (2013) and Umetsu
et al. (2016).

The central 32 √ó 32 arcsec region shows signatures of possible
cases of mass-to-light deviations. These are examined in detail in
Section 4.2.

4 COMPARISON OF LENS MASS AND STELLAR MASS

4.1 SED Fitting with FAST++

There are 4 prominent ellipticals in the central ‚àº 100 kpc region of
A1689: BCG, G1, G2, and G4 (see Figure 5b). To compute their
stellar mass, and stellar mass associated with smaller galaxies in
that region we used fast++3, a faster and more eÔ¨Écient version
of the original IDL-based code fast (Kriek et al. 2009), that Ô¨Åts
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) templates to broadband pho-
tometry and/or spectra. Depending on the input parameters, fast++
can compute the best-Ô¨Åt redshift, age, dust content, star formation
timescale, metallicity, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and
their conÔ¨Ådence intervals. To Ô¨Ånd the best-Ô¨Åt parameters it uses ùúí2-
minimisation. The conÔ¨Ådence levels are calibrated using Monte Carlo
simulations.

A review on various SED Ô¨Åtting methodologies can be found in

Walcher et al. (2011) and Conroy (2013).

We used Ô¨Çuxes in Ô¨Åve photometric bands (F336W, F475W, F625W,

F775W and F814W) spanning the observed near-UV and optical.

The PSF matched and background subtracted Ô¨Çux mosaics in those
bands were generated by Alavi et al. (2014) along with the associated
Ô¨Çux RMS values. However, the Ô¨Çux RMS values only include the
instrumental and background errors but exclude the random Poisson
noise associated with the Ô¨Çux from the galaxies. We calculated this
Poisson noise as,

‚àö

ùúép =

R √ó t = ‚àöÔ∏ÅN/G

(1)

where R is the electron count rate per second, t is the observation
time in seconds, G is the inverse gain, and N is the number of detected
events (photons). The calculated Poisson noise values were added in
quadrature to the existing RMS maps.

For the input parameters to fast++, we used the Bruzual & Charlot

proÔ¨Åles are shown as black dashed line for S-reconstruction and black dash-
dotted line for All-reconstruction. The shaded regions represent the 68% CL
uncertainties in the reconstructed mass distributions. The radial proÔ¨Åles are
very similar for both the reconstructions. The region of the outer clump in the
north-east region shows the expected bumps around the same locations in the
radial proÔ¨Åles.

3.3 Results: Mass Reconstruction

Our best Ô¨Åt reconstructions are obtained by averaging 40 indepen-
dent Grale runs. Each run starts with a random seed producing a
similar but diÔ¨Äerent map. Constrained by the required computational
resources, the number of independent Grale runs (i.e., 40), is con-
sistent with our previous works (Ghosh et al. 2021, 2020). In this
work, we are using a reconstruction area of 0.62 Mpc √ó 0.62 Mpc
and the smallest resolution cell (projected Plummer sphere) has a
radius of ‚àº 4 kpc.

The reconstructed mass distributions for the S- and ALL-
reconstructions are shown in Figure 2, overlaid over the ACS/F814W
mosaic. The surface mass density values in these maps are scaled by
Œ£crit,0 = 5.47 kg/m2. The corresponding reconstructed critical lines
and caustics for each of the reconstructions are shown in Figure 3.
In both Figure 2 and 3 the multiple image systems used to produce
the corresponding reconstructions are shown as red stars for systems
with spectroscopic redshifts, and red triangles for systems with pho-
tometric redshifts. The regions outside the area covered by lensed
multiple images are not well constrained, so the details of that mass
distribution are not accurate. However, it is safe to say that the pres-
ence of Grale reconstructed mass in those regions does mean that
there is external mass, but its amount and distance from the cluster
center are not certain and are degenerate.

The reconstructed mass distribution shows the presence of a promi-
nent mass clump about 50 arcsec (‚àº155 kpc) to the north-east of the
central region. This mass clump is in agreement with all previous re-
constructions as well as the previous Grale reconstruction obtained
by Mohammed et al. (2014), with a much smaller number of images.
Our reconstructions also show an extension of the mass to the south

4.2 Results

The central ‚àº 100 kpc region is the most well constrained area in
our reconstructions. It contains ‚àº 25 mutiply lensed images. The
luminosity distribution of that region in Johnson B-Ô¨Ålter is shown in
Figure 5a. Figure 5b shows the stellar mass distribution obtained for
this region of the cluster in a pixel-by-pixel manner using fast++.4
The BCG and nearby major bright galaxies (G1-G4) in this region
are marked in these Ô¨Ågures for easier identiÔ¨Åcation. All these galaxies
are ellipticals in nature, with the only exception of G3, which is a
spiral.

Since the angular size of the smallest Plummer in our Grale
reconstructions is about ‚àº 1.3 arcsec (4 kpc), i.e., larger than the
angular resolution of the stellar mass and light maps, in order to do
a fair comparison between the two we needed to smooth the stellar
mass and light distribution. We used a Gaussian Ô¨Ålter on the stellar
mass and luminosity maps with an FWHM of 1.3 arcsec.

The comparison of the stellar mass distribution to the reconstructed
lensing mass distribution is shown in Figure 6, and the comparison of
the luminosity distribution to the reconstructed lensing mass distri-
bution is shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows a cross-sectional proÔ¨Åle
of the total and stellar mass, as well as stellar light, along the dashed
line in Figures 6 and 7. The fact that this region is well constrained
by lensed images provides conÔ¨Ådence to the reality of the mass struc-
tures. In this region we found three lensing mass peaks, M0, M1, M2,

4 We did not mask any high-ùëß pixels containing the strongly lensed images,
which look like small faded spots in Figure 5b. Since they are small and faint,
and we are using Gaussian smoothing on the stellar mass distribution (as will
be explained later in this section) their contributions are negligible.

all of which are accompanied by stellar counterparts, BCG, G1+G2,
G4, respectively. Galaxies G1 and G2 are 3.7 arcsec apart, making it
hard for Grale to resolve.

The mass clump associated with the BCG is diÔ¨Äuse, similar to its
light distribution. There is a slight oÔ¨Äset of ‚àº 3 arcsec (‚àº 10 kpc)
between the BCG and the nearest reconstructed mass peak, M0. If
dark matter is self-interacting, galaxy clusters are expected to have
constant density cores, which will allow the BCGs to wobble, and
hence clusters will have a range of oÔ¨Äsets from the cluster mass
center. Based on BAHAMAS-SIDM simulations with dark matter
self-interaction, Harvey et al. (2019) derive probability distributions
of BCG oÔ¨Äsets in the centers of equilibrium galaxy clusters. Assum-
ing self-interaction cross-sections of ùúé = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 cm2/g,
and that the mass distribution in the center of A1689 is consistent
with the criteria of that study, 8%, 17%, 24% and 41% of clusters,
respectively, would have oÔ¨Äsets > 10 kpc.

We also Ô¨Ånd a lensing mass peak M3, which is not accompanied
by any light peaks. Between M1 and M3, there is a mass dip, M5,
which is ‚àº 15 kpc wide. There is also another lensing peak, M4, not
associated with any light peaks. However, due to lack of multiple
images in its surrounding region it is not as well constrained as other
lensing mass peaks. Additionally, there is a bright star to the left of
that region making it harder to Ô¨Ånd multiply lensed images or even a
faint galaxy in that area.

The location of the light-unaccompanied substructure (M3)
roughly matches with the location of dark matter halo center of
Limousin et al. (2007), indicated by a blue cross in Figure 6. The
reconstruction obtained by Coe et al. (2010) also has an elongated
structure in that region stretching out from the mass clump associ-
ated with the BCG. Thus, our M3 is similar to mass clumps detected
by two other reconstructions: simply-parametrized Lenstool and
free-form LensPerfect. We searched for light signatures from dust-
obscured galaxies in the Spitzer/IRAC data of the same region in all
four IRAC infra-red bands, but were unable to Ô¨Ånd any such structure,
while the other galaxies in the region showed up prominently. Haines
et al. (2010) obtained Herschel/PACS 100 ùúám map of A1689: there is
no spectroscopically conÔ¨Årmed cluster member at the location of M3.

smaller than that of an ùêø‚àó galaxy. Its 3D mass density is ùëõ ‚àº 1.1 √ó

Assuming that M3 is real, we can estimate some of its properties.
From Figures 6 and 8, M3‚Äôs projected density is at least ŒîùúÖ ‚âà 0.4
above the nearby background projected density. (ùúÖ is surface mass
density in units of critical surface mass density for lensing, Œ£crit,0.)
Its radial extent on the sky is ùëü ‚àº 5 kpc. Assuming a similar extent
along the line of sight, M3‚Äôs mass is ‚àº 8.3 √ó 1010 ùëÄ(cid:12), somewhat

There are two possibilities for the dynamical state of M3 (an
intermediate state is also possible). If M3 is gravitationally self-
bound, then ùê∫ ùëÄ/ùëü ‚àº ùë£2 would imply that a typical velocity of the
particles making it up is ùë£ ‚àº 270 km/s. If M3 is not bound, then
typical particle velocities within it are similar to those in the center
of the cluster, ‚àº 1500 km/s, (Lemze et al. 2009) and the structure

would disperse in a time it would take a particle travelling at typical
velocity to cross it, ‚àº 6 √ó 106 years. Since this is a very short time
scale, we conclude that either we are observing the cluster at a very
special time, or M3 is gravitationally self-bound.

Assuming the latter, and if dark matter is self-interacting, with
cross-section ùúé cm2/g, the time scale for the structure to dis-
perse due to particles scattering oÔ¨Ä each other is, ùúè ‚àº (ùëõ ùúé ùë£)‚àí1
(Miralda-Escud√© 2002; Peter et al. 2013). This can be rewritten as,
ùúè = 1.27√ó107 (ùëü/kpc)1/2 (ùúé/[cm2/g])‚àí1 (ŒîùúÖ)‚àí3/2 years. Assuming
ùúé = 1 cm2/g, yields a time scale of ùúè ‚àº 1.1 √ó 108 years. If the cluster
formed at ùëß = 0.5, then that value of ùúè represents ‚àº 3.8% of the time
between ùëß = 0.5 and the redshift we observe it at, ùëß = 0.18. The
shortness of ùúè suggests that the actual cross-section is smaller, which
would allow M3 to persist for a longer time. This limit is similar
to some other limits from the literature: based on the Bullet Clus-
ter, Robertson et al. (2017) estimate self-interaction cross-sections
ùúé (cid:46) 2 cm2/g. Harvey et al. (2019) Ô¨Ånd that ùúé > 0.12 cm2/g are
probably ruled out. A recent analysis of eight strong lensing galaxy
clusters by Andrade et al. (2022) concludes that ùúé is consistent with
0. Though our limit is not as stringent as that, it does suggest that
dark mass clumps within clusters can yield constraints on dark matter
self-interaction properties.

The histogram of the ratio of the total mass to stellar mass is
shown in Figure 9. Median M/M‚àó values are 6.44 and 6.05 for ALL-
and S-reconstructions, respectively. M/M‚àó is greater than 1 for most
of the region, which is reassuring because the lensing mass should
be greater than the stellar mass. We stress that Grale does not use
cluster galaxies as input, so this is an unbiased measure of the mass
distribution in the very center of the cluster.

The histogram of the ratio of the total mass to light (in solar units)
is shown in Figure 10. Median M/LB values are 45.5 and 43.5 for
ALL- and S-reconstructions, respectively. M/LB > 10 for most of
the region.

The stellar mass-to-light ratio is ‚àº 10 for most of the central 100

seven (including A611) had M/LB ‚àº 1 ‚àí 4. For ellipticals outside of
galaxy clusters M/L ratios are similar or lower. A sample of SAURON
nearby ellipticals has stellar M/LB in the range 1 ‚àí 3, within their
eÔ¨Äective radii (Cappellari et al. 2006), while a study of 7 ellipticals

We have obtained reconstructions of Abell 1689 using our free-
form algorithm Grale with two diÔ¨Äerent sets of multiply lensed
systems from the available data. The Ô¨Årst set, which contains 107
images, consists of only the secure systems - the S-reconstruction -
and the second sets, with 151 images, consists of all available systems
excluding a few problematic systems (see Section 3.2). Both of the
reconstructions produced similar mass distributions (see Figure 2)
and their circularly averaged density proÔ¨Åle agrees very well with
each other as shown in Figure 4. The density proÔ¨Åles are well Ô¨Åt
by the NFW proÔ¨Åle in the range ‚àº 15 ‚àí 100 kpc with concentration
parameter values (ùëê = 6.88 ¬± 0.44 for the S-reconstruction, and
ùëê = 6.86 ¬± 0.45 for the ALL-reconstruction) which are in agreement
with prior reconstructions of A1689 (see Section 3.3). The Ô¨Åtted
NFW proÔ¨Åles do not indicate the presence of a Ô¨Çat density core down
to ‚àº 15 kpc. The absence of a core (cid:38) 50 kpc is somewhat at odds
with the Ô¨Åndings of Beauchesne et al. (2021) who Ô¨Åt parametric cored
and non-cored proÔ¨Åles to three clusters: AS 1063, MACS J0416, and
MACS J1206, and found that cored models Ô¨Åt better.

In this work we focus on two separate scales of the reconstruction
results: mass features inside the central ‚àº100 kpc region, and the mass
features outside the central ‚àº100 kpc region. On the latter scale, we
found two main mass features (see Section 3.3): Ô¨Årst, the outer clump
in the north east region, about 50 arcsec (155 kpc) from the cluster
center which is retrieved by every previous reconstruction of this
cluster by diÔ¨Äerent lens modelling groups using diÔ¨Äerent parametric
and free-form methods. Second, we found a southern extension of
the overall mas distribution (beyond the image region, ‚àº 200 kpc) of
the cluster. A similar, but smaller extension appears to be present in
reconstructions presented in Limousin et al. (2007) and Cha & Jee
(2022).

For the central ‚àº 100 kpc, we computed the stellar mass distribu-
tion using the SED Ô¨Åtting software fast++ and Ô¨Çuxes in photometric
bands spanning the near-UV and optical (see Section 4.1). This re-
gion is the most well constrained area within the reconstructions
containing ‚àº 25 multiply lensed images. Comparison of the stellar
mass with the Grale reconstructed lensing mass shows three lensing
mass peaks accompanied with bright stellar counterparts (see Fig-
ure 6). The mass clump associated with the BCG is diÔ¨Äuse, similar
to its light distribution. We found a small oÔ¨Äset (‚àº 10 kpc) between
the BCG and the nearest reconstructed lensing mass peak. If dark
matter is self-interacting, for interaction cross-sections smaller than
ùúé ‚àº 0.1 cm2/g, oÔ¨Äsets as large as 10 kpc will be produced by 17%
of clusters (Harvey et al. 2019). There is also a lensing peak near
the center of this region without a stellar counterpart (dark). The
location of this peak roughly matches the location of the dark matter
halo center of the parametric Lenstool reconstruction obtained by
Limousin et al. (2007). The free-form LensPerfect reconstruction
by Coe et al. (2010) has an elongated structure stretching out from
their central mass clump associated with the BCG. Our inspection of
Spitzer infra-red data found no presence of any dust-obscured galax-
ies in that region, and Herschel does not have any conÔ¨Årmed cluster
members at that location. If conÔ¨Årmed with future data/analysis, the
presence of this dark peak can be interpreted in terms of dark matter
properties as discussed in Section 4.2.

Since Grale does not use any cluster light distribution as input, it
provides an unbiased measure of the mass distribution in the central
part of the cluster. The median of the ratio of stellar mass to lensing
mass (M/M‚àó) in this region are found to be 6.05 and 6.44 for the
S- and ALL- reconstructions (see Figure 9). The M/M‚àó > 1 for
most of the region is in agreement with the fact that the lensing

mass should be greater than the stellar mass. We found median mass-
to-light ratios (M/LB) in this region to be 43.5 and 45.5 for the
S- and ALL-reconstructions, respectively (see Figure 10), which is
consistent with, but on the upper end of, values found in the literature.
The goal of lensing reconstructions is to produce maps with prop-
erly quantiÔ¨Åed accuracy and precision. Comparison between recon-
structions that use diÔ¨Äerent lens inversion methods is probably the
best way to accomplish that. In Ghosh et al. (2021) we carried out
such a comparison for the merging cluster Abell 370, based on the
data from Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) and Beyond Ultra-deep Fron-
tier Fields and Legacy Observations (BUFFALO) strong lensing data
sets. For this work on A1689 we conclude that on spatial scales of
about 100 kpc and above, most, and probably all mass reconstructions
agree. The discrepancies between reconstructions start on scales be-
low ‚àº 100 kpc. This is consistent with our conclusions from Abell
370, where Grale found an oÔ¨Äset of ‚àº35 kpc between the BCG and
the associated reconstructed mass peak. A survey of the literature on
A370 showed that 11 out of 16 reconstructions had a roughly similar
oÔ¨Äset. We also found a mass clump of size ‚àº100 kpc, ‚àº250 kpc to the
east of the A370 cluster center. Out of the same 16 reconstructions,
7 has a roughly similar feature. It is encouraging that reconstructions
that use diÔ¨Äerent methodologies often agree on such mass features.
When evidence for these becomes more convincing, they can be used
to place stringent constraints on the nature of dark matter.

As a future prospect, we plan to incorporate the stellar mass distri-
bution from the SED Ô¨Åtting results as a starting point for the Grale
based solutions.

APPENDIX A: MULTIPLY LENSED SYSTEMS FOR A1689

The list of multiple images is provided in Table A1. More details on
the lensing data can be found in Section 2.2.

As a measure of how well Grale uses and retrieves the input
lensed images with the reconstruction process, one can compute the
separations (ŒîùúΩ) between the observed lensed image positions and
reconstructed image positions in the lens plane. Reconstructed lensed
image positions are obtained by, Ô¨Årst, back projecting the original im-
ages to the source plane and computing the average source positions
for each system of multiple images using the reconstructed deÔ¨Çec-
tion angle values. This average back-projected location can then be
forward lensed through the reconstructed lens mass distribution to
obtain the reconstructed lensed image positions. Smaller lens plane
separations between the original lensed image positions and recon-
structed image positions would imply a better reconstruction of the
system. Sometimes the distances for all input images are combined
into one single statistic as root mean squared sum, namely the lens
plane RMS (e.g., Williams et al. 2018; Ghosh et al. 2020). Mathe-
matically this can be expressed as,

where ùêº is the number of systems with multiplicities (number of
multiple images in each system) ùêΩùëñ for the i-th system. In Figure A1,
we presented a histogram of lens plane separation values for the input
lensed images used for both of our reconstructions. The lens plane
RMS values are found to be 2.29 arcsec for the S-reconstruction and
2.82 arcsec for the ALL-reconstruction. As seen in the histogram,
for some of the systems, a few of the images have very large lens
plane separation values skewing the distribution to the right. The
number of these cases are higher for the ALL-reconstruction since
it contains a larger number of less secure systems. If these outliers
having more than 10 arcsec lens plane separations are removed the
lens plane RMS values comes down to be 1.59 arcsec for the S-
reconstruction and 1.89 for the ALL-reconstruction. Since the lens
plane rms values are sensitive to outliers, we can instead calculate
the median of the lens plane separations, which are found to be 0.40
arcsec and 0.64 arcsec for the S- and ALL- reconstructions. This
shows a small improvement of the input image utilization by Grale
when only the secure systems are used as input.

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX Ô¨Åle prepared by the author.
