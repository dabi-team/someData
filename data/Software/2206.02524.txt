Abstract 

The study of aerosols and droplets emitted from the oral cavity has become increasingly 

important throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies show particulates emitted while 

speaking were generally much smaller compared to coughing or sneezing. However, recent 

investigations revealed that they are large enough to carry respiratory contagions. Although 

studies have shown that particulate emissions do indeed occur during speech, to date, there is 

little information about the relative contribution of different speech sounds in producing 

particle emissions.  This study compares airborne aerosol generation in participants producing 

isolated speech sounds: fricative consonants, plosive consonants, and vowel sounds. While 

participants produced isolated speech tasks, a planar beam of laser light, a high-speed camera, 

and image software calculated the number of particulates detected overtime. This study 

compares airborne aerosols emitted by human participants at a distance of 2.54 cm between the 

laser sheet and the mouth and reveals statistically significant increases in particulate counts 

over ambient dust distribution for all speech sounds.  Vowel sounds were statistically greater 

than consonants, suggesting that mouth opening, as opposed to place of vocal tract constriction 

or manner of sound production, might be the primary influence in the degree to which 

particulates become aerosolized during speech. Results of this research will inform boundary 

conditions for computation models of aerosolized particulates during speech.

Introduction 

The study aims to quantify aerosols and droplets that range from one to one hundred 

micrometres in diameter emitted during isolated speech tasks. Recent studies have found that 

two of the three primary routes of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 include the 

droplet and airborne routes.1–4  The droplet route involves those larger particles that are ejected 

at a close enough range to contact another person’s mouth or nose directly, while the airborne 

route involves the inhalation of aerosolized droplet nuclei which can become entrained in the 

airflow after their initial expulsion.5 Regardless of the size of the particle, droplet or airborne, it 

is difficult to determine if those particles carry a viral load.  As such, merely measuring particle 

count does not unequivocally determine if those particles carry viral loads. Despite this, 

measuring particulate count is a reasonable method to estimate the potential for viral 

transmission. 

Aerosols, usually defined as particles less than 10 micrometres in diameter, are a subject 

of particular interest because virus-carrying aerosols can stay airborne and travel through a 

space for hours, posing an extended risk of infection.1  A study published in 2009 demonstrated 

that exhaled particles carry multiple pathogens, including influenza.6  However, if a proportion 

of exhaled particles that are likely to carry a viral load is known, one still must be able to 

determine how many particles a person encounters before calculating the risk of transmission 

for a given scenario.7 Thus, based on reasonable estimates of viral load in a given particle, a 

meaningful investigation of the risk of viral exposure for an activity should consider the number 

and size of particles a person encounters.2,8–10 

Some of the best and most well-known investigations in this topic are focused on 

investigating the airflow that originates at the oral and nasal cavity.11 Techniques used to 

observe the airflow usually include shadow-graphing or Schlieren imaging to collect optical 

data.12 This kind of imaging is non-intrusive to the expiration event, allowing expulsion of air 

3 

 
flow into a free field.  Thus, the data are ecologically relevant for everyday scenarios. This 

imaging technique lends itself to studies that focus on abrupt events like coughing and 

sneezing in which documented airspeed during a cough may be of importance.13 Other studies 

that apply this technique to speaking and regular breathing show airflow events during speech.  

Unfortunately, these methods do not provide data about the particles expelled by the airflows 

they investigate, which leaves estimations of viral load yet to be calculated.  

Other studies focus exclusively on the particulate matter that is expelled during a 

cough, a sneeze, or regular breathing.11,14,15 The number, size, and potential pathogen load have 

been investigated and documented in various studies.6  However, the techniques used for these 

studies are usually intrusive and involve collection of the particles in a funnel,16–18 tube,19 or 

box20 as soon as they leave the participant’s oral or nasal cavity, interrupting the airflows that 

occur naturally in free space. Additionally, although these studies quantify the number of 

potential virus laden particles, visualization of the behaviour of particles as they disperse in the 

air remains under investigation.21 

Formulating effective protection from viral exposure requires information on how 

individuals contribute to the sum of virus laden particles in the environment, and how to 

protect themselves from subsequent exposure to increased viral load.  As such, understanding 

the nature of how particulates and the ensuing aerosolized infectious load are emitted from the 

oral cavity and interact with the environment requires in-depth study.  Previous work that 

investigated particle emission in speech has used connected speech sounds in sentences, 16,19–21 

singing phrases,19,21,22 oral breathing,15 coughing, and sneezing,11 and has shown that this line 

of research requires controlled investigations of multiple factors contributing to particulate 

emissions and its resultant behavior.  However, such studies miss key details such as the 

changes in speaking jet angles with different sounds. 23    Recently, a meta-study24 found 

experiments on aerosolization with speech sounds used relatively few numbers of human 

4 

 
 
participants (typically ~1).20,23,25–32 The meta-study focuses mainly on aerosol production 

with plosives and identifies high particle production for plosives.   

Speech and singing are inherently complicated activities, involving the interaction of 

aerodynamic forces with the mucosal lining of the vocal folds and vocal tract.33 Vortices 

induced by vocal fold vibration and vocal tract constriction34 have the potential to shear 

mucus-lined walls in the oral cavity and stretch saliva, which then distribute these mucous 

droplets into the air as they are expelled from the mouth.  To better understand the conditions 

that contribute to the expulsion of particulate matter, investigating the effect of vocal tract 

constriction at various places along the path from the vocal folds to the exit from the oral 

cavity appears to be a good starting point.  In essence, investigations seeking to understand the 

relative contributions individuals have in producing particulates should include parsing out the 

specific speech gestures that produce increased particulates, identifying conditions where 

particulates might stay aerosolized, while controlling for physiological differences in 

participants’ physical constitution.   

This larger pilot study aims to give a visual representation of the particles emitted from 

the nose and mouth, controlling for speech sound production and physical condition, while also 

providing quantitative conclusions about particle count, size, distribution, and dispersion at 

three different close-range distances from the source. A careful process of image collection and 

algorithmic analysis for data collection allows both objectives to be accomplished. The unique 

experimental setup of this study allows participants to be safely positioned near a light source 

powerful enough to illuminate the particles in a free field and capture images of them with a 

high-speed camera for analysis.  The images and image sequences can provide a better 

understanding of the behavior of the particles, while the numerical and statistical data can be 

used to verify computational models designed to predict the motion of the particles under 

specific speech conditions. 

5 

 
The purpose of this current study was twofold: first, to test the feasibility of measuring 

particulate emissions from humans in a free field and second, to determine if individual speech 

sounds produced particulate emissions at varying levels.  Results from both research questions 

will be factored into a larger scale experimental study with the purpose of developing 

computational models of aerosol and droplet behaviour. 

Materials and Methods 

This investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of 

Memphis and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Participants included 9 

females (average age 30.2 years, range 24-47 years), and 11 males (average age 39.6 years, 

range 28-63 years) recruited through social media and word-of-mouth. The study included 4 

female and 4 male singers. All participants consented to participate. The final analysis omitted 

three participants, one female and two males due to technical malfunction.  

A.  Experiment Setup 

To meet the aims of the research study, an experiment was designed with the goal of 

quantifying and comparing particle counts at a close-range distance in a free field while 

participants performed isolated speech sounds. Figure 1 illustrates the setup of the proposed 

experiment which included the laser, high-speed camera, and participant head enclosure 

mounted on an optical table. Each participant performed isolated speech sounds while seated 

with their head placed in a small enclosure that consisted of a frame with a solid front panel 

with an opening for the nose and mouth. The laser and camera were positioned on a table, and 

the entire setup was enclosed in a 3m x 3m x 3.7m sealed canopy tent as shown in figure 2. A 

dehumidifier was used to maintain a relative humidity of 35% in the enclosure. An 11 m3/min 

four-layer HEPA filtration unit was used to reduce the ambient dust in the space before each 

data collection scenario. The filter was turned off during testing to mitigate air movement so as 

to not interfere with the behavior of the aerosol expelled by the participant. Laser sheet 

6 

 
 
imaging was used for data collection. Big Sky Ultra, dual pulsed, neodymium yttrium-

aluminium garnet (ND-YAG), 532 nm lasers were used for the study. Each laser was pulsed at 

rate of 30 Hz and operated at their maximum power of 30mJ. The beam passed through a 

beam-spreader lens to transform the shape of the laser into a vertical sheet which was 

approximately 3mm thick. This laser sheet passed in front of an opening in a vertical board, 

which the participant sat behind. As the participant performed the vocal exercises, the aerosols 

scattered the laser light as they passed through the illuminated plane, and the light was 

scattered into the lens of the camera. A 1280 x 1024 pixel PCO 1200 HS camera captured grey 

scale images of all the aerosols that passed through the plane of the laser at 40 frames per 

second. 

Figure 1. Model of camera, laser, and enclosure frame setup 

The participant head frame and cloth enclosure shown in figure 2 and figure 3 were 

designed to increase participant comfort while reducing reflective light from the laser sheet. 

The front of the enclosure was constructed of a solid wood frame, and its main purpose was to 

ensure the source of particulates, namely, the participant’s oral and nasal cavity, stayed at a 

consistent distance from the laser. The frame was adjusted such that the participant was seated 

7 

 
 
 
 
a consistent distance away from the fixed laser sheet at 2.5cm. All proper personal protective 

equipment, including laser safety goggles, were provided for the participant and the technical 

operator in the lab.

B.  Experiment Procedure 

Prior to particulate data collection, physiological measurements including body mass index, 

spirometry, subglottal pressure, glottal air flow rates, and glottal contact area were collected to 

serve as control variables. This de-identified data will not be presented here but may be used as 

pilot data in future investigations on individual factors of physical constitution that affect levels 

of aerosol expiration employing a larger number of participants.   

Before a participant entered the laser laboratory, a speech language pathologist trained 

participants in the speech tasks that were elicited during data collection. Elicited tasks included 

isolated productions of plosive and fricative consonants (/p, b, k, g, ∫, ʒ/), vowels (/a, i, u/), 

singing, and oral breathing. Speech and singing tasks were completed at two different loudness 

levels35 and voice speech tasks included low pitch, based on average speaking fundamental 

frequency, and high pitch, based on the 80% mark of the total range. Speech tasks were 

recorded using a Zoom H6 Handy recorder (Tokyo, Japan) at 48 kHz sampling rate and 24-bit 

depth with an AKG C520 headworn cardioid condenser microphone (Vienna, Austria) at a 450 

angle 10 cm from the mouth center. Each production fell between 53 dB SPL and 72 dB SPL.  

For this initial feasibility analysis, speech tasks and phonetic classifications being compared in 

this study are presented in Table 1. For this analysis, all tasks were at normal pitch and normal 

loudness and counterbalanced across participants for place and manner. Cognate pairs were 

recorded within the same trial beginning with voiceless phonemes.

As a control, prior to the participant entering the enclosure for data collection, the laser was 

pulsed, and the camera captured images of the ambient dust in the space. Once in the 

laboratory, participants were positioned on an adjustable seat to line up their mouth and nose 

with the opening in the enclosure as previously described. As they performed the speech tasks, 

the laser illuminated the aerosols, and the camera captured a time sequence of images. An 

audio recording and a sound level reading were also collected and synchronized to the high-

speed camera to determine the specific time frames for analysis. The camera recorded for 

approximately 8 seconds while the participant completed the sequence of speech tasks. At 40 

fps, each video sequence produced approximately 300-400 images.  

Following data collection, the participants were given questionnaires about demographics.  

Once these questionnaires were completed, they were thanked and paid for their participation.  

The entire study lasted about 2.5 hours.

B.  Data Reduction and Analysis 

An image post-processor, Image J, analysed the sequence images for particle counts and 

sizes captured for the control and the speech tasks. Audio waves and particle count were 

visually and temporally synchronized using an external clapperboard.  Only particle counts that 

occurred within the time frame of the audio signal were included in the analysis. The 

synchronization of the audio file with the particle counts increased the confidence that a 

statistically significant increase in particle count was likely a consequence of the speech task. 

Examples from a time sequence of raw images for a participant vocalizing the three instances 

of the front-plosive consonant /p/ at a distance of 2.5cm are shown with the audio 

synchronization in figure 4.

In answer to the first question about the feasibility of measuring particulate emissions from 

humans in a free field that could then be used in a computational model, the synchronized 

audio recordings were used to confirm the particle counts associated with specific speech tasks.  

For each confirmed phoneme, the maximum particle count was determined and aggregated into 

one data set.  For each phoneme, the aggregated particle count was compared against the 

average background dust sets, which was aggregated separately. To analyse the second 

question, which was to determine if individual speech sounds produced particulate emissions at 

varying levels, a separate repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; SPSS v.25, 

IBM) was used to compare voicing (unvoiced vs voiced) place (front, mid, and back 

assessed separately for consonants and vowels), manner (fricatives vs plosives), and 

sequence (first, second, third trial).  Alpha levels were set at p=.05 for each ANOVA. 

Linear and quadratic analysis were then applied to each ANOVA as to assess the 

relationship between the individual factors. No post hoc analysis on specific conditions 

were completed. 

Results 

A. Signal to Noise Assessment 

Nine speech sounds were analysed using a one-way ANOVA against the background dust: 

two front-plosives (/p, b/), two back-plosives (/k. g/), two mid-palatal fricatives (/∫, ʒ/), and 

three vowels (/a, i, u/). All utterances were statistically significant at a confidence of 95% 

compared to the background dust. The count, mean, variance, confidence, and p-values are 

presented in Table 2. As shown in Figure 5, the background dust did not vary significantly 

across participant runs.

B.  Speech Sound Assessment 

In answer to the question if particulate count differed between specific linguistic 

categories, findings were mixed.  Between voiced and unvoiced consonants, a repeated-

measures ANOVA showed no significant main effect, F(1, 16) =.938, p = 0.347.  Similarly, 

particulate count did not differ according to consonant placement, F(2, 32) =.484, p = 

0.540, or between plosive and fricative consonants, F(1, 16) =.554, p = 0.467.   

13 

 
 
 
 
 
However, particulate count differed according to sequence of utterance, F(2, 32) 

=8.747, p = 0.050.  Additionally, the linear contrast for the sequence of utterance reached 

significance, F(1,16) =6.007, p = 0.026, suggesting that particulates increased in number 

as utterances increased in number.  Finally, particulate count differed according to vowel 

placement, F(2, 32) = 3.637, p = 0.038. Furthermore, the quadratic contrast for the 

sequence of utterance reached significance, F(1,16) =4.678, p = 0.046, with the vowel /a/ 

showing greater particulate emissions and the vowel /i/ showing the least.  Given the 

relative mouth opening among /a/, /i/, and /u/ it appears as though mouth opening 

might be the reason for greater emissions.  Descriptive statistics for particulate count for 

each speech sounds can be found in Table 2. Figure 6 shows a graphical comparison 

across categories.

Discussion and Conclusions 

This investigation sought to quantify aerosol emissions during the production of 

specific speech sounds that will serve as validation data for computational simulation and 

modelling of particulates during speech.  Aerosols emitted via the oral cavity were captured 

using a time sequence of images with a laser and highspeed camera while participants 

produced different phonemes, representing specific linguistic qualities. The two purposes of 

this study were to test the feasibility of using a ND-YAG laser operating at 532 nm in a free 

field and to test if individual speech sounds differ in the number of particulates emitted from 

the oral cavity.  This study served as a preliminary investigation to establish validation data for 

computations models of aerosol behavior during various speech tasks.  

The results clearly demonstrate that the method of data collection can capture the 

increase in aerosolized particles due to human emission over the background dust, which was 

also quantified.  One shortcoming included the lack of synchronization between the laser 

pulses and the camera frame rate during the recording of phoneme production. When the laser 

and camera were not precisely synchronized to optimize the laser illumination and shutter 

speed, the increase in particle counts observed during the vocal task may have been under-

recorded. Further refinement to the methodology with higher resolution recordings and laser 

synchronization will be required to establish if there are significant differences in emission 

levels based on the phoneme produced. Despite this, the quantification of specific speech 

sounds above noise is apparent and will prove important in validating computational 

simulations and models. Additionally, the Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) 

technique can be utilized in future work to resolve the aerosols between 10 micron and 1 

micron near the mouth aperture that were not likely resolved with the current PIV setup. Such 

quantification of the number, size, distribution, and speed of droplets being emitted within a 

centimetre of the mouth aperture (loosely defined as the near field) is critical in specifying an 

15 

 
accurate boundary condition for numerical models of the polydisperse flow in the far field. 

Experimental quantification of the polydisperse flow in the near field using human participants 

may also enable parametric classification of currently less defined descriptors, such as super 

emitters and super spreaders. 

In answering the second aim of this study, although there appear to be mixed results on 

whether specific speech sounds differ in the production of particulates, this method does 

appear to produce solid analysable data.  Some phoneme classes showed clear differences, as 

in the case of the placement of vowels, while others did not.  Although the method of speech 

sounds production could clearly show particulate emissions, establishing that there are the 

differences in particulate emission during specific phonemes production was not confirmed in 

this study.  In addition to the potential for reduced particulate illumination due to the 

inconsistency in synchronization of images, it could be that our choice of phonemes did not 

adequately determine differences between phoneme classes. Additionally, it could be that 

comparisons across multiple phoneme categories, not simply one exemplar from each category 

is necessary to obtain significant and meaningful results. Determining the relative contribution 

of linguistic factors such as vocal fold vibration (voicing), the location in the vocal tract where 

airflow is manipulated and constricted (place), or how the airflow is manipulated (manner; 

completely or constricted occlusions) may be useful in establishing boundary conditions for 

computational models that would not only model aerosols emitted from the mouth but also 

model how those aerosols might be created in the vocal tract.   

The lack of statistical power in this study might be another cause for failing to show 

differences between phonemes.  Although this study analysed 17 healthy adults, the number of 

conditions and parameters that were studied might have weakened the power to observe the 

desired results. Although each participant produced each phoneme 3 times for a total of 54 

observations per phoneme, this number might have fallen short.  This is surprising given that 

16 

 
other studies employing the same methods showed clear differences between their conditions.  

Mürbe and colleagues 19 employed only eight participants who produced five trials per 

condition.  However, their analysis included 30 sec of data per trial analysing a larger time 

period.  In addition, they compared running speech and singing, which may have yielded an 

overall greater difference between the tasks they were investigating. Good and colleagues 21 

also compared singing vs. speaking tasks and employed 63 participants analysing data over a 

variable period of time.  However, in this study they correlated particle count with other 

variables such as CO2, which was not comparable for power analysis.  In our study, our 

analysis only covered approximately 4 sec of data for three trials. Additionally, all conditions 

investigated in our study came from the same class of task, the production of isolated speech 

phonemes.  Thus, power analysis for the number of trials per phoneme, or class of phonemes, 

should be investigated to unequivocally determine any differences across linguistic 

characteristics. Such discrimination will validate computational modelling with greater 

precision. 

One statistically significant finding noted in this study revealed that the sequence of 

phoneme production differed between the first production and the third production.  This 

finding is most likely due to the increase of particle accumulation across measures, which is 

likely why previous studies noted robust findings.  The residence time of particles lingering 

was clearly longer than the time between phoneme productions. Measuring phoneme 

production with greater time between trials might result in no differences between initial and 

final phoneme production.  This level of specificity might be important when validating a 

computational model but begs the question of ecological validity of the research design. It is 

highly unlikely that individuals produce single phonemes in daily communication, thus, the 

specificity needed for modelling validation might reduce the generalizability of research 

findings. Furthermore, phonemes are rarely produced in isolation and change according to the 

17 

 
physical parameters of neighbouring phonemes.  Coarticulatory factors will undoubtedly 

influence the nature and degree of particulate emissions.  Continued research on not only single 

phonemes but also coarticulatory phenomena will reflect ecological situations and provide 

appropriate validation for models that predict how particles behave at the syllable, word, 

sentence, and conversational levels. 

The wide range of variability in particle emissions among the participants was of 

particular note in this study.  Within one phoneme category, two participants produced particle 

emissions 4 standard deviations from the mean and one other produced emissions at 2 standard 

deviations.  The high degree of variability in particle count has been reported in two other 

studies,16,17  which highlights the need for greater controls and more specific inclusion criteria 

in this type of study. The interparticipant variability also speaks to the inherent individual 

differences that might contribute to the aerosolization of mucous in the vocal tract, which is 

ultimately emitted from the oral cavity.  Non-speech factors such as body mass index, age, 

total lung volume/capacity, systemic hydration level, medications, and mucosal tissue health 

are likely to contribute to the degree of particle emission.  Additionally, controlling for speech 

intensity, speech kinematics and articulatory precision, respiratory drive, aerodynamic 

characteristics of vocal fold vibration, and vocal tract morphology will be important in 

developing a precise model of particle emission and behavior from the oral cavity. 

This investigation characterized particulate emissions at the phonemic level in 

isolation, makes this study unique.  The importance of understanding aerosolization at this 

level of specificity will be helpful in understanding how aerosols are emitted, not just that 

they are emitted. Knowledge of how particulates are emitted provides the necessary basis in 

the development of aerosol emission mitigation techniques.  It also will prove useful in 

developing a more nuanced computational model that accounts for vocal tract configuration. 

A deeper understanding of how particulates are created, leave the oral cavity, and interact
