ABSTRACT
We investigate the spatial distribution of Lyman-𝛼 (Ly 𝛼) absorbers within cosmic voids. We create a catalogue of cosmic voids
in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) with the VoidFinder algorithm of the Void Analysis Software Toolkit
(VAST). Using the largest catalogue of low-redshift (z . 0.75) IGM absorbers to date, we identify 392 Ly 𝛼 absorbers inside
voids. The fraction of Ly 𝛼 absorbers inside voids (65 per cent) is comparable to the volume ﬁlling fraction of voids (68 per
cent), and signiﬁcantly greater than the fraction of galaxies inside voids (21 per cent). Inside voids, the spatial distribution of
Ly 𝛼 absorbers diﬀers markedly from that of galaxies. Galaxy density rises sharply near void edges, while Ly 𝛼 absorber density
is relatively uniform. The radial distribution of Ly 𝛼 absorbers inside voids diﬀers marginally from a random distribution. We
ﬁnd that lower column density Ly 𝛼 absorbers are more centrally concentrated inside voids than higher column density Ly 𝛼
absorbers. These results suggest the presence of two populations of Ly 𝛼 absorbers: low column density systems that are nearly
uniformly distributed in the interiors of voids and systems associated with galaxies at the edges of voids.

Key words: intergalactic medium – large-scale structure of the Universe – quasars: absorption lines

1 INTRODUCTION

The intergalactic medium (IGM) has constituted the majority of
baryonic matter throughout cosmic history. Though it remains chal-
lenging to detect in emission (Steidel et al. 2011; Frank et al. 2012;
Martin et al. 2014a,b), the IGM has been extensively studied through
absorption-line spectroscopy of distant active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
going back to the ﬁrst detection by Lynds (1971). AGN spectra dis-
play weak absorption lines blueward of the AGN frame Ly 𝛼 (1216
Å) emission line. This collection of discrete absorption features, the
Ly 𝛼 forest, is produced by diﬀuse intergalactic hydrogen along lines
of sight to AGNs (Gunn & Peterson 1965; Sargent et al. 1980).

The physics underlying the Ly 𝛼 forest has been fairly well un-
derstood since the mid 1990s, when resolved spectral studies with
the Keck telescope’s High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES)
matched earlier results from cold dark matter simulations (Cen et al.
1994; Hu et al. 1995). Ly 𝛼 absorbers are highly photoionised clouds
with temperature ∼ 104𝐾 (Zhang et al. 1995; Miralda-Escudé et al.
1996; Hernquist et al. 1996). Improved understanding of intrinsic
physical properties of the Ly 𝛼 forest has furthered understanding of
the IGM. The Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation (FGPA),
which relates observable Ly 𝛼 optical depth to intrinsic matter den-
sity (Weinberg et al. 1998; Croft et al. 1998), has been used to de-
termine the matter ﬂuctuation spectrum and mean baryon density
(Rauch et al. 1997; Weinberg et al. 1997), yielding constraints on
cosmological parameters (Croft et al. 1999, 2002; McDonald et al.
2000, 2006; Viel et al. 2004, 2008).

The Ly 𝛼 forest has been extensively studied over an interme-
diate redshift range (2 . z . 5), where it can be observed with

ground-based optical instruments. The Ly 𝛼 forest is more dif-
ﬁcult to probe at lower redshift because it must be investigated
with space-based UV spectrographs. Notable among the latter are
Copernicus (Spitzer et al. 1973), International Ultraviolet Explorer
(Boggess et al. 1978), and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
(Moos et al. 2000). Additionally, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
has hosted a series of ultraviolet spectrographs, including the Faint
Object Spectrograph (FOS), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph
(GHRS), Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), and more
recently the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). Early observations
with FOS showed that the number density of Ly 𝛼 absorbers falls
from z = 2 to z = 0, though not as dramatically as originally expected
(Bahcall et al. 1991; Morris et al. 1991). Bahcall et al. (1996) pro-
posed that low-z Ly 𝛼 absorbers might consitute a distinct population
from high-z absorbers, with the former tracing galaxy halos and the
latter tracing the cosmic web. Against this view, Davé et al. (1999)
demonstrated that contemporaneous observations were entirely con-
sistent with the structure formation model of the Ly 𝛼 forest. This
established the prevailing consensus that low-z and high-z absorbers
are fundamentally the same.

Nevertheless, the Ly 𝛼 forest changes signiﬁcantly with redshift.
To a given sensitivity limit, the Ly 𝛼 forest becomes sparser with
decreasing redshift. This results from the fact that a given overden-
sity corresponds to a higher atomic hydrogen column density NHI
at high-z than at low-z (Davé et al. 1999). The redshift evolution of
the Ly 𝛼 forest is dominated by expansion-driven decrease in mean
baryon density and the decline of quasars, the main source of meta-
galactic ﬂux (Theuns et al. 1998; Haardt & Madau 2001). By z . 2
structure formation shocks have heated ∼ 50 per cent of the IGM by
mass above photoionisation temperature into a warm-hot (WHIM)
phase (Cen & Ostriker 1999; Davé et al. 1999). At z ∼ 0.1, Ly 𝛼

absorption may be detectable in only 30 ± 10 per cent of the IGM
by mass (Shull et al. 2012). This detection shortfall lead to the long-
standing “Missing Baryon Problem”, which appears to have been
recently resolved. The physical baryon density parameter Ω𝑏 ℎ2 de-
rived from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and
later Planck observations was signiﬁcantly higher than direct obser-
vation showed (Jarosik et al. 2011; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016),
until de Graaﬀ et al. (2017) and Tanimura et al. (2018) located so-
called "missing baryons" in a hot, diﬀuse phase of the IGM and the
intracluster medium (ICM).

In this paper, we clarify the relationship between the low-z Ly 𝛼
forest and the large-scale structure seen in the spatial distribution of
galaxies. As components of the IGM, Ly 𝛼 absorbers might be ex-
pected to trace the ﬁlaments that contain galactic groups and clusters,
and to avoid the voids that occupy ∼ 70 per cent of the volume in
the universe but contain only ∼ 10 per cent of galaxies. However,
searches for voids in the high-z Ly 𝛼 forest have turned up nega-
tive (Carswell & Rees 1987; Ostriker et al. 1988; Pierre et al. 1988).
Grogin & Geller (1998), using a small sample 18 Ly 𝛼 absorbers at
very low redshift (𝑐𝑧 < 104 km s−1), found that absorbers do not
trace galaxies, and appear to be distributed randomly. Penton et al.
(2002b) noted that voids contain mostly low-NHI absorbers, with
high-NHI absorbers tracing large-scale structure.

More recent research at low redshift suggests that the fraction
of Ly 𝛼 absorbers inside voids signiﬁcantly exceeds the fraction
of galaxies inside voids. Tejos et al. (2012) and Pan (2011) both
examined HST/STIS Ly 𝛼 absorbers in the SDSS DR7 galaxy void
catalog of Pan et al. (2012). Tejos et al. (2012) stated that 43 percent
of their Ly 𝛼 absorber sample is inside voids. They used a void
catalog based on the void ﬁnding method that we use in this paper
(see discussion of the VoidFinder algorithm in section 2 below), but
to simplify their analysis, they deﬁned each void as the largest sphere
that could ﬁt inside an irregularly shaped void region. Pan (2011)
found 77 per cent of HST/STIS Ly 𝛼 absorbers (Danforth & Shull
2008) to be inside voids, and also found evidence that the absorbers
prefer the deep interior volume of voids. Of the 92 absorbers inside
voids, 34 were inside the inner eighth of void volume, signiﬁcantly
greater than the 11 ± 3 that would expected for a random distribution.
These striking ﬁndings motivate the research that we present below.
We describe the galaxy void catalog and IGM absorber catalog in
Section 2 below. In Section 3, we detail the classiﬁcation of Ly 𝛼
absorbers as being in galaxy voids or walls, and compare their prop-
erties. We characterize the spatial distribution of Ly 𝛼 absorbers
inside voids in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss our ﬁndings in
light of hydrodynamic simulations that relate observables to intrinsic
properties of absorbers. In Section 6, we summarize our results.

2.1 Galaxies

Our galaxy sample is derived from SDSS DR7 (Abazajian et al.
2009). A 2.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mex-
ico provided photometric observations in ﬁve bands for SDSS DR7
(Fukugita et al. 1996; Gunn et al. 1998). Images were processed and
classiﬁed, and spectroscopic observations were taken of galaxies with
Petrosian r-band magnitude 𝑟 < 17.77 (Lupton et al. 1999, 2001;
Strauss et al. 2002). The galaxy catalogue we examine in this paper
is Version 1.0.1 of the NASA-Sloan Atlas of Blanton et al. (2011).

2.2 Ly 𝛼 Absorbers

We use the third version of the Survey of the Low-Redshift Intergalac-
tic Medium with HST/COS (Danforth et al. 2016 hereafter D16), the
largest and most sensitive survey of the low-z IGM to date1. The
catalog is derived from far-UV HST/COS spectra of 82 relatively
nearby AGN (zAGN<0.9). The COS G130M and G160M gratings
were used for 68 of the spectra, and the remaining 14 were taken
with G130M alone. The spectra have high-S/N (& 15), which al-
lows for identiﬁcation of numerous weak absorption lines (down to
log (𝑁𝐻 𝐼 ) ∼ 1012). As detailed in D16, a sophisticated automated
line ﬁtting technique was used to identify Ly 𝛼, as well as other
hydrogen, helium, and metal absorption lines in the spectra. Derived
parameters include Doppler width b, redshift zabs and atomic hydro-
gen column density NHI. All absorbers are at redshift zabs < 0.75, but
Ly 𝛼 absorption is only observed at z < 0.47; at higher redshift, Ly 𝛼
is redshifted past the end of the COS/G160M detector. The catalog
includes both individual spectral components and redshift absorp-
tion systems, which are groupings of components within a narrow
velocity window (30 km s−1 for most lines, c Wr /𝜆0 for strong broad
lines) that are presumed to be physically associated. A discrete IGM
cloud corresponds to an absorption system, and may display multi-
ple spectral components. Therefore, we treat the redshift absorption
systems as synonymous with Ly 𝛼 absorbers, and only use Ly 𝛼
components to compute the two point correlation function in Section
4.

3 LARGE-SCALE ENVIRONMENT OF LY 𝛼 ABSORBERS

3.1 Galaxy Voids in SDSS DR7

We construct a void catalog in SDSS DR7 using the VoidFinder algo-
rithm of the Void Analysis Software Toolkit2 (VAST; Douglass et al.
2022). VoidFinder was originally developed by Hoyle & Vogeley
(2002, 2004) based on the work of El-Ad & Piran (1997). The al-
gorithm uses third nearest-neighbour distances to identify probable
void galaxies, which are then removed from the sample. It then ﬁlls
the cavities between the remaining galaxies with numerous overlap-
ping spheres of various sizes. These empty spheres are combined
into aspherical void regions. VoidFinder voids are constructed from
the union of sets of overlapping spheres, each of which shares ≥ 50
per cent of their volume with the largest sphere in the void. Any

void too small to contain a sphere with radius 10 h-1 Mpc is dis-
carded. This volume cutoﬀ means that our void catalog is unreliable
within 10 h-1 Mpc of the boundaries of SDSS DR7, and so we do not
examine Ly 𝛼 absorbers or galaxies in that peripheral volume. We
choose the VoidFinder algorithm to deﬁne voids because comparison
with tessellation-based methods clearly demonstrate that it is supe-
rior for the purpose of deﬁning the void environment of galaxies and,
presumably, of IGM absorbers (Zaidouni et al. 2022, in preparation).
We compute comoving distances of galaxies and Ly 𝛼 absorbers
in h-1 Mpc using the Planck 2018 estimates of Ω𝑚 = 0.31 and
ΩΛ = 0.69 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2018). We apply VoidFinder
to a volume-limited sample of SDSS DR7 galaxies (z< 0.107, r-band
absolute magnitude Mr < -20.09). Our void catalog consists of 995
galaxy voids, each of which is the union of approximately 30 non-
concentric overlapping spheres of various sizes. We use Monte Carlo
integration to locate the geometric center and compute the average
volume of each void. For each void, we uniformly distribute random
points inside a rectangular prism that contains the irregularly shaped
mass of nested spheres. We eliminate the points that are outside the
constituent spheres, leaving a high density sample that ﬁlls the void.
The average position of that sample is the void center. Figure 1 is a
histogram of eﬀective void radius Rv = (3V /4 𝜋 )(1/3) for the 995
VoidFinder voids in SDSS DR7.

We also create a sample of random points (hereafter referred to
as the survey randoms) that uniformly ﬁlls most of the three dimen-
sional comoving volume of SDSS DR7, excluding a buﬀer region 10
h-1 Mpc from the boundary surfaces of the survey, where VoidFinder
cannot detect voids. We classify the survey randoms as being in
walls or voids. The fraction of survey randoms inside voids, 68 per
cent, approximates the volume ﬁlling fraction of VoidFinder voids in
SDSS DR7.

We note that our void catalogue is similar, but not identical, to
that of Pan et al. (2012). Their void catalogue was constructed from
a similar sample of SDSS DR7 galaxies to the one described in
Section 2. They used an earlier version of VoidFinder that had less
stringent boundary conditions than the VAST VoidFinder that we use
for our void catalogue (see Douglass et al. 2022 for details). In the
Pan et al. (2012) void catalogue, constituent spheres of voids may
extend outside the galaxy survey by as much as 50 per cent of their
volume. By contrast, the constituent spheres of voids in our catalogue
cannot have more than 10 per cent of their volume outside the SDSS
DR7 volume. Note again that our statistical analyses do not use any
objects that lie within a 10 h-1 Mpc buﬀer near the survey boundary.
The developers of the VAST package have recently published a new
void catalog for SDSS DR7 using the newest version of VoidFinder
(Douglass et al. 2022). They used VoidFinder on the same sample of
SDSS DR7 galaxies that we use, but with a less restrictive magnitude
and redshift cut on the volume-limited sample (Mr<-20, z<0.114).
As a result, their catalog has more voids and spans a somewhat larger
volume within SDSS DR7.

3.2 AGN Sight Lines in SDSS DR7

We restrict our investigation to AGN sight lines within the SDSS DR7
footprint, which includes 36 of the 82 AGN sight lines examined by
D16 (see Figure 2). The mean eﬀective radius Rv of VoidFinder
voids in SDSS DR7 is 16 h-1 Mpc, roughly 20 times smaller than the
average comoving length of the sight lines inside SDSS DR7. Thus,
we expect each sight line to pierce multiple void and wall regions,
and we can consider the angular positions of the AGN sight lines to
be unbiased with respect to large-scale structures. However, we have
a relatively small number of sight lines along which we can probe the

IGM, so it is possible that, by chance, these sight lines do not probe a
representative sample of large-scale structures. To characterize how
these 36 sight lines intersect large-scale structure in SDSS DR7, we
construct dense a linear random distribution along the lines of sight
and we determine if each random point lies inside a VoidFinder void.
We refer to this distribution as the sight line randoms.

3.3 Ly 𝛼 Absorbers and Galaxies in SDSS DR7 Voids

The sight lines in Figure 2 contain 605 absorption systems inside
the redshift limit of our void catalog (0.003 ≤ z ≤ 0.107). If an
absorber lies inside any of the constituent spherical holes of the
voids, it is classiﬁed as a void absorber. Otherwise, it is considered
a wall absorber. Galaxies are classiﬁed in the same manner. Since
VoidFinder voids have a minimum radius of 10 h-1 Mpc, some of
the objects we classify as being in walls actually reside in small
voids. In our classiﬁcation scheme, walls encompass a wide range of
environmental conditions, from dense structures to small voids. The
void classiﬁcation is stricter.

We illustrate results of our classiﬁcation in Figure 3 (a), a
10 h-1 Mpc thick slice of SDSS DR7, with wall and void galax-
ies from the volume-limited sample in orange and blue, respectively.
The slice midplane contains the sight line to AGN Q1230+0115, in-
dicated by a black line, with void and wall Ly 𝛼 absorbers marked as
red and black bars, respectively. Figure 3 (b) shows the same slice,
with irregularly shaped blue blobs representing VoidFinder voids.
Each VoidFinder void is the union of a set of spheres (about 30 per
void). Figure 3 (b) plots in grey the overlapping circular intersections
of the constituent holes with the slice midplane.

We ﬁnd that Ly 𝛼 absorbers are not preferentially found in walls,
unlike galaxies, which suggests that the spatial distribution of Ly 𝛼
absorbers does not trace ﬁlaments and clusters in the galaxy distri-
bution. The fraction of Ly 𝛼 absorbers in voids is 65 per cent, com-
parable to the fraction of sight line randoms in voids, 72 per cent,
which approximates the fractional length of the AGN sight lines in-
side voids. In contrast, only 21 per cent of SDSS DR7 galaxies in
the volume-limited sample are inside the voids. Unsurprisingly, the
galaxy void fraction is far lower than the fraction of survey randoms
inside voids, which approximates the ﬁlling fraction of voids, 68 per
cent. The small diﬀerence in void fraction of sight line randoms and
survey randoms, 72 vs. 68 per cent, reﬂects the ﬁnite sampling eﬀect
discussed above in Section 3.2.

4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF LY 𝛼 ABSORBERS IN

VOIDS

Theoretical considerations of how physical conditions of the IGM
vary with large-scale structure suggest that we carefully examine
how Ly 𝛼 absorbers are spatially distributed. Cosmological hydrody-
namic simulations indicate that the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium
(WHIM) becomes a more important constituent of the IGM at z<1
(Davé et al. 2010). We expect that the WHIM is predominantly found
in and around walls, because the IGM in voids, particularly in the deep
interiors of voids, does not experience gravitational shock-heating
from structure formation. Additionally, super-Hubble expansion in-
side voids should adiabatically cool and lower the density of the
IGM. Thus, Hydrogen inside voids should be cooler, less ionised,
and more diﬀuse than in walls. These large-scale environmental ef-
fects on the physical state of intergalactic hydrogen aﬀect the spatial
distribution of Ly 𝛼 absorbers. Here we examine how the density
of Ly 𝛼 absorbers varies inside voids, from the boundaries with the
walls down into the centers of voids.

To examine enivornmental eﬀects on IGM, we need to carefully
characterize void shape and see where absorbers reside. The left panel
of Figure 4 shows the intersection of a void and its constituent spher-
ical holes with a plane. This void, like others in our catalogue, has
a complex, irregular geometry. The centre and right panels compare
two measures of position inside the void, the distance from the walls

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

dw and the scaled voidcentric distance r/Rv. At low dw (see Figure 6),
eﬀects from shock-heating in walls should be more prominent. Near
the void centre, it is perhaps more informative and straightforward to
consider concentric shells of r/Rv. We measure the distance outward
from the volume-weighted centre of the void, and divide that distance
by the eﬀective void radius represented by the dashed black circle.
Shells of r/Rv are spherical near the centre, but start to get cut oﬀ
as they collide with the void boundary at higher r/Rv. We keep track
of which objects are inside the void, so the absorber at upper right,
which is just outside the void but less than Rv from the centre, would
not be considered when we construct the density proﬁles shown in
Figure 8. We note that previous research on the void density proﬁle
(e.g. Colberg 2004) has used simple spherical models for void shape.
This slice shows that such an approach tends to mix wall and void
regions together at the void boundary.

4.1 Wall Distance

The IGM at the edges of voids, where they interface with dense struc-
tures, may be shock-heated by structure formation, albeit less strongly
than in the walls themselves. Thus, the IGM near void boundaries is
likely to be more highly ionised than the IGM deeper inside voids.
At the same time, the void density proﬁle of the IGM should behave
similarly to that of the volume-limited sample of SDSS DR7 galaxies
shown in Figure 6, with a sharp increase around a voidcentric dis-
tance of Rv. We compute the density of Ly 𝛼 absorbers as a function
of distance dw from cosmic walls to observe the eﬀect of variation
in IGM density and ionisation fraction on Ly 𝛼 absorbers.

To compute the distance from cosmic walls dw to each void Ly 𝛼
absorber, we generate a uniform distribution of random points on the
irregular boundary of each void (recall that the volume of each void
is the union of overlapping spheres of varying radius). We estimate
dw as the distance from a void Ly 𝛼 absorber to the nearest random
point on the void surface. In the same way, we compute dw for void
galaxies. Histograms of dw for void Ly 𝛼 absorbers and void galaxies
shown in Figure 5, are markedly diﬀerent. Void galaxies are almost
all within 2 h-1 Mpc of cosmic walls. The number of void Ly 𝛼
absorbers shows a shallower decline with dw.

To convert the measurements of dw to estimates of densities of
Ly 𝛼 absorbers and galaxies inside voids, we also compute dw for
survey randoms and sight line randoms (see Section 3) inside voids.
This allows us to estimate the available void volume as a function of
dw, which we use to determine the number density of galaxies as a
function of dw for each void. We then stack the galaxy density proﬁles
as shown in Figure 6 (blue). We also show the stacked density proﬁle
of Ly 𝛼 absorbers (red). We estimate length of AGN sight lines inside
bins of dw with the sight line randoms, and use that to construct a
linear density proﬁle of Ly 𝛼 for the voids. In these void density
proﬁles, the bar height is normalized by the maximum density in
voids, so that the vertical axis 𝜌𝑛 is unitless, but still proportional to
the physical density.

The linear density of Ly 𝛼 absorbers in Figure 6 (red) spikes near
the void boundary, but otherwise shows no clear trend with dw. The
density peaks at 15-16 h-1 Mpc and 17-18 h-1 Mpc are statistically
insigniﬁcant, as these bins each contain fewer than ﬁve absorbers. The
volume density of void galaxies is greatest near void-wall interfaces,
but falls precipitously beyond dw = 1 h-1 Mpc and remains relatively
ﬂat thereafter.

indicated by the vertical line, and the slice midplane contains the sight line. Wall and void galaxies are marked respectively in orange and blue, while wall and
void Ly 𝛼 absorbers are black and red bars along the sight line. The AGN itself is outside the redshift limit of SDSS DR7. Bottom - The same slice from SDSS

4.2 Voidcentric Distance

This is necessary because, as noted above, we include only objects
inside voids and volume inside voids to compute density proﬁles.

Next we examine how the densities of Ly 𝛼 absorbers and galaxies
vary from the centers of voids outwards. We measure these density
proﬁles both as a function of physical distance in h-1 Mpc and as a
function of the scaled distance from each void center. To estimate
densities, we use randoms to estimate the available volume in each
bin of distance, as we did above for the density dependence on dw.

Figure 7 shows the void density proﬁles of Ly 𝛼 absorbers and
galaxies as functions of voidcentric distance r. The proﬁles are
stacked for all voids, and the bar height is normalized to eliminate
physical units as before. Note that a particular value of voidcentric
distance, r, does not correspond to a ﬁxed value of wall distance,
𝑑𝑤 , because voids are not spherically symmetric. As discussed in

Ly 𝛼 absorber positions marked by vertical black ticks. The origin of this plot sits on the void’s volume-weighted centre. Left - Constituent spherical holes of a
VoidFinder void, which have circular intersections with the slice. This void is typical of others in our catalogue in that it consists of about 30 overlapping holes.
The void is the union of the holes, and its intersection with the slice is shown in white. We emphasize that this void, like all VoidFinder voids that consist of
multiple holes, does not have a perfectly spherical boundary. Centre - Contours of distance to the walls dw in h-1 Mpc. We use dw to characterize the positions
of void absorbers and galaxies in the stacked density proﬁles shown in Figure 6. This is useful for understanding environmental eﬀects of proximity to walls, as
dw is sensitive to the irregular void boundary. Right - Circular annuli of scaled voidcentric distance, r/Rv, emanating from the void centre. The dashed circle
indicates the eﬀective radius Rv. We use r/Rv to characterize the positions of void absorbers and galaxies in the stacked density proﬁles shown in Figure 8. This
helps us to understand environmental conditions of the interior of a void, but is less useful at higher values of r/Rv, where the annuli start to collide with the
irregular void boundary.

uncertainties.

Section 2, the geometric center of each void is located using Monte
Carlo integration. The density of galaxies increases with voidcentric
distance, with an abrupt rise between 10 and 12 h-1 Mpc. The Ly 𝛼
absorber density proﬁle, by contrast, is relatively ﬂat; the prominent
spike in the lowest bin of r is not statistically signiﬁcant, because
it encompasses a very small volume and contains only two Ly 𝛼
absorbers.

To compare density proﬁles of voids with diﬀerent sizes, we com-
pute the scaled voidcentric distance r/Rv for each Ly 𝛼 absorber and
galaxy inside voids. In Figure 8, we show the void density proﬁle
of Ly 𝛼 absorbers (red) as a function of r/Rv. Density is generally
relatively ﬂat. The enhanced Ly 𝛼 absorber density near the void
center is of low statistical signiﬁcance. This behavior is quite distinct
from that of void galaxies (blue). Galaxy density is lowest near the
void centers and rises dramatically near void-wall boundaries. From
Figure 6, we might expect an even sharper rise of galaxy density near

are not spherical.

4.2.1 Statistics of Void Ly 𝛼 and Galaxy Spatial Distributions

To quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of diﬀerences between the
galaxy and Ly 𝛼 absorber distributions inside voids, we compute
their cumulative distributions 𝐹𝑟 𝑠 as functions of scaled voidcentric
distance r/Rv, as shown in Figure 9. We also compute the cumulative
distribution functions of the sight line randoms (see Section 3), as
well as a random distribution of uniform volume density. Figure
9 shows that Ly 𝛼 absorbers (red) are very slightly less centrally
concentrated in voids than linear randoms (green), but signiﬁcantly
more centrally concentrated than galaxies (blue).

We perform an Anderson-Darling test on the cumulative distribu-

enhancement in the lowest bin is not statistically signiﬁcant). However, the
rough statistical test summarized in Table 1 below shows that absorbers in the
lowest quartile of column density are over-represented in the deep interiors
of voids, while the highest quartile of column density is under-represented.
By contrast, the density of galaxies is . 10 per cent of the cosmic mean near
void centres and rises sharply near void edges.

edges.

4.2.2 Two-Point Correlation Function of Ly 𝛼 Absorbers

We compute the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of Ly 𝛼 lines
to characterize their small-scale clustering. This statistic was pre-
sented in D16 using an earlier version of the HST/COS low-z IGM
catalog. Here, we use a similar procedure to ﬁnd the 2PCF using
the latest edition of the catalog. Individual Ly 𝛼 absorption lines
were used to compute the 2PCF, since redshift systems group closely
spaced components together and thus provide no information about
small-scale clustering. The estimator of the 2PCF is,
𝜉 (Δ𝑣) = 𝑁𝑜𝑏𝑠 (Δ𝑣)
𝑁𝑟 𝑎𝑛 (Δ𝑣)

− 1

(1)

where Nobs and Nran are the number of pairs of observed and simu-
lated random absorbers within a velocity separation 𝛿𝑣 (Labatie et al.
2010). Thus 𝜉 gives the probability of clustering above random. The
sight line randoms that we use to compute Nran are distributed uni-
formly along the AGN sight lines. By contrast, D16 employ a more
complicated procedure to distribute random absorbers. At each reso-
lution element Δ𝑣 in an AGN spectrum, they compute the minimum
equivalent width for detection based on the S/N of the data to de-
termine the probability of detection within the resolution element.
They place a random absorber within the resolution element if the
probability exceeds a random number. Notwithstanding this diﬀer-
ence in the randoms, our resulting 2PCF for Ly 𝛼 absorbers, shown
in 10, is nearly identical to that presented by D16. Clustering is
weak, especially for Δ𝑣 > 100 km s−1, which indicates that there
is not signiﬁcant large-scale structure in the spatial distribution of
Ly 𝛼 absorbers. By contrast, galaxies typically exhibit strong clus-
tering as measured by the 2PCF in redshift space, 𝜉 ≈ 5 on scales
r < 10 h-1 Mpc (Li et al. 2006).

tion functionss of Ly 𝛼 absorbers and the sight line randoms. We
ﬁnd a p-value of approximately six per cent, a marginally signiﬁcant
result that suggests that Ly 𝛼 absorbers are not uniformly distributed
inside voids. This quantiﬁes the visual impression in Figure 9 that
Ly 𝛼 absorbers are slightly less centrally concentrated inside voids
than sight line randoms. This diﬀerence in cumulative distributionss
is most apparent at scaled voidcentric distances of 0.4 to 0.7.

We also carry out the Anderson-Darling test to compare galaxies
with Ly 𝛼 absorbers, and ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence
(p<0.01); galaxies are more concentrated near the void-wall interface
around r/Rv = 1, whereas the Ly 𝛼 absorbers have a more uniform
distribution inside voids. This statistical result is further evidence
that galaxies and Ly 𝛼 absorbers have distinct spatial distributions.

4.3 Doppler Parameters of Void and Wall Ly 𝛼 Absorbers

Simulations (Cen 2011) indicate that structure formation shock heats
the intergalactic medium in walls but not voids. This environmental
eﬀect could be reﬂected in the Doppler b parameter, a measure of
the width of an absorption line, which is a function of not only ab-
sorber temperature, but also nonthermal eﬀects. In some cases, the
COS spectral resolution may not be ﬁne enough to resolve compo-
nent structure, particularly for strong absorption systems. Following
the example of D16, we examine the Doppler parameter of weak
(log(NHI) < 13.5), single-component systems for which the b-value
is more indicative of temperature. The mean b-value is somewhat
higher in voids (mean ¯𝑏 = 32.4 ± 1.2 km s-1, median 28.0 km s-1)
than walls (mean ¯𝑏 = 30.6± 1.8 km s-1, median 25.2 km s-1). This

result is surprising, given that we might expect Ly 𝛼 absorbers in the
walls to have a higher average b-parameter because of shock heating
from structure formation. However, the diﬀerence is of modest sta-
tistical signiﬁcance and the resolution of HST/COS is predicted to
limit the use of the 𝑏 parameter for measuring thermal properties of
the IGM in this range of line width (Davé et al. 2010).

4.4 Column Density and Spatial Distribution of Void Ly 𝛼

Absorbers

We test for dependence on the large-scale void environment of the ob-
served column density, NHI, of absorption systems. This distribution
is of interest because, while the void environment is characterized by
lower matter density and, therefore, structures with smaller charac-
teristic mass, the IGM in voids is expected to have a higher neutral
fraction. The statistical distribution of column densities reﬂects a
complex, environmentally-sensitive interplay of astrophysics.

Perhaps surprisingly, comparison of the means of the column den-
sity 𝑁 (𝐻𝐼) of absorbers observed in walls and voids does not reveal
a strong environmental diﬀerence. We ﬁnd that the mean log 𝑁𝐻 𝐼 of
wall absorbers, 13.59 ± 0.89, does not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from that
of void absorbers, 13.43 ± 0.73.

A more detailed probe of environmental diﬀerences in the IGM
is the column density distribution (CDD) of Ly 𝛼 absorbers, the
number of absorbers per interval of column density per unit redshift
pathlength, in voids and walls. Figure 11 is a log-log plot of the CDD
of Ly 𝛼 absorbers in voids and walls (see Figure 5 in D16 for the
CDD of the entire set of Ly 𝛼 absorbers). The CDD is computed
as in Danforth & Shull (2008). We correct the eﬀective redshift path
length Δ𝑧 for void and wall absorbers using sight line randoms to
estimate the fraction of sight lines in voids and walls, respectively
72 and 28 per cent; as discussed above, the majority of absorbers are
in voids. Thus normalized, the CDDs quantify the frequency of ab-
sorbers per unit pathlength in the separate environments. Note that at
small column densities observations of both wall and void absorbers
are limited by the the sensitivity limits of HST/COS. Correction for
this limit is important because simulations suggest that most discrete
Ly 𝛼 absorbers are low-NHI (Davé et al. 2010). Completeness cor-
rection factors at the lower range of column density (identical for
void and wall absorbers) are based on a ﬁfth order polynomial ﬁt to
redshift pathlengths for bins of column density in Table 5 of D16.

The steepness of the CDD is quantiﬁed by 𝛽, where 𝜕𝒩/𝜕𝑁 𝜕𝑧 ∝
𝑁 −𝛽 (that is, the slope in Figure 11 plus one) (Dave & Tripp 2001).
Over the full range of column density observed, we ﬁnd 𝛽 = 1.72 ±

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

0.03 for void absorbers, steeper than in walls, where 𝛽 =1.54 ± 0.05.
Compared to voids, walls contain a higher ratio of high to low col-
umn density systems. The shallower slope of the wall CDD is likely
connected to the fact that higher column density systems are more
closely associated with galaxies, which by deﬁnition are primarily
found in walls. For the combination of void and wall absorbers, 𝛽 =
1.65 ± 0.02. This is matches the value obtained by D16 for the ﬁrst
edition of their IGM absorber catalog. Davé et al. (2010) simulated
the CDD of Ly 𝛼 absorbers for HST/COS and predicted a somewhat
higher value, 𝛽 = 1.70 ± 0.1.The voids dominate the statistics of the
combined distribution because they contain the majority (about 70
per cent) of absorbers.

Our observations of the void and wall CDD contrast with simu-
lation results of Tonnesen et al. (2017). They compared the CDDs
of Ly-𝛼 absorbers found in hydrodynamic simulations of two en-
vironments: an underdense region centered on a void and an over-
dense region centered on a galaxy cluster. They found a steeper
CDD in the overdense region than the underdense region over
12.5 < logNHI <14.5 (to the left of the vertical line in our Figure
11), primarily because the overdense region had fewer high column
density absorbers. If we restrict our computation of 𝛽 to the more
limited range of column density that they examined, we ﬁnd values
for 𝛽 in voids and walls (1.70 ± 0.06 and 1.63 ± 0.11 respectively)
that are similar to our ﬁndings for the full range of column density;
the observed wall CDD is shallower than the void CDD. The diﬀerent
ﬁndings in these simulations and our observations may be aﬀected by
diﬀerences in classiﬁcation of large-scale environment. By including
small voids in our deﬁnition of walls (recall that VoidFinder imposes
a minimum void radius of 𝑅𝑣 = 10ℎ−1 Mpc), our wall sample may
include some absorbers in underdense regions. Another possibility is
that this disagreement indicates that the two regions examined in the
simulations are not representative of typical overdense and under-
dense volumes in the low-redshift universe. Perhaps the environment
of the +1.8𝜎 "cluster" region in the simulation suppresses absorber
abundance more than the typical overdense environment sampled by
our "wall" regions. Tonnesen et al. (2017) ﬁnd that the underlying
IGM clouds in their cluster simulation region are typically at least
a factor of 1.5 hotter than in the void region. In the temperature
regime 𝑇 ∼ 104.5 K, such a temperature diﬀerence would manifest
as a roughly 4 km s−1 increase in the 𝑏 parameter (for purely thermal
broadening, 𝑏 = 12.8(𝑇/104 K)1/2 km s−1), but our measurement
of Doppler 𝑏 parameters for wall and void absorbers does not yield
evidence of such a shift (note again that the measured 𝑏 parameters
are also substantially broadened by the spectroscopic resolution of
HST/COS). Our CDD is less aﬀected by cosmic variance in the void
and wall environments, because we examined Ly 𝛼 absorbers in a
much larger volume, including hundreds of voids.

Next we test for variation with column density of the location
of absorbers within voids. We might expect lower column density
absorbers to be more prevalent in the deep interiors of voids, where
the IGM is isolated from shock heating from structure formation in
dense regions. To test for that eﬀect, we split the 392 void absorbers
into quartiles of column density and perform a very simple test: What
fraction of absorbers are found at less than half the void radius? For
each quartile, we count the number of Ly 𝛼 absorbers in the inner
eighth of void volume, Nobs (r/ Rv < 1/2). The total number of objects
N in voids is compared with Nobs (r/ Rv < 1/2), the number inside
the inner eighth of void volume, and Nran (r/ Rv < 1/2), the number
expected from Poisson statistics.

Thus, we ﬁnd suggestive evidence that low-NHI absorbers are more
centrally concentrated in voids and that the highest column density
absorbers are less centrally concentrated, as summarized in Table 1.

Figure 11. Column density distribution (CDD) of HST/COS Ly 𝛼 absorbers
in walls (black) and voids (red). This function, the number of absorbers
per logarithmic interval of column density per unit redshift pathlength, is
shallower in walls because they contain relatively more high column density
systems. For the sake of comparison, the upper limit of the range of column
density examined in Figure 2 of Tonnesen et al. (2017) is marked with a
vertical bar.

In other words, there is a trend for lower column density absorbers
to be overrepresented in the central regions of voids. This accords
with the observation that low-NHI absorbers are the least strongly
correlated with galaxies, which are most sparse in the void interiors.

4.5 Galaxy Association of Void Ly 𝛼 Absorbers

To probe interactions between galaxies, the CGM, and the IGM, we
ﬁnd the distance, dg, of each Ly 𝛼 absorber to the nearest SDSS DR7
galaxy in both volume-limited and apparent-magnitude limited sam-
ples. Following the procedure in Keeney et al. (2018), we compute
the velocity separation Δ𝑣 between a galaxy and absorber to ﬁnd
distance along the line of sight

𝐷𝑧 =

|Δ𝑣 | − 400 𝑘𝑚 𝑠−1
𝐻 (𝑧)

0

(

Δ𝑣 > 400 𝑘𝑚 𝑠−1
Δ𝑣 ≤ 400 𝑘𝑚 𝑠−1

where 𝐻 (𝑧) = 100ℎ 𝑘𝑚 𝑠−1 𝑀 𝑝𝑐−1. For low velocity separation,
small line-of-sight distances are collapsed to zero. This is a correc-
tion for small-scale redshift space distortions along the line-of-sight
caused by gravitational motions within systems of galaxies. The im-
pact parameter of the galaxy with respect to the AGN sight line and
𝐷𝑧 are added in quadrature to obtain the three dimensional distance
𝑑g.

Figures 12 and 13 show distance to nearest galaxy, dg, versus
column density, NHI, for void (red) and wall absorbers (black), com-
paring respectively with volume-limited and apparent-magnitude
limited samples of SDSS DR7. As expected, the denser apparent-
magnitude limited sample yields closer matches. Previous studies
(e.g. Penton et al. 2002a; Stocke et al. 2006; Keeney et al. 2018) have
generally found that Ly 𝛼 absorbers at higher dg have lower equiva-
lent width or column density. Our results are similar, in that higher-
NHI absorbers tend to be more closely associated with galaxies. The
large-scale environment of Ly𝛼 absorbers in walls or voids does not
noticeably aﬀect the distribution of dg, apart from the fact that void
absorbers are considerably more prevalent at higher dg, because they
occupy regions of lower galaxy density. In Figure 13 we see a popu-
lation of void absorbers that are close to galaxies (dg < 1 h-1 Mpc);
these matches tend to occur close to the void edges. A relatively
small number of wall absorbers are also relatively isolated from
bright galaxies; these occupy voids that are below the cutoﬀ radius

5 DISCUSSION

The spatial distribution of HST/COS Ly𝛼 absorbers inside voids
shares characteristics with both a uniform random distribution and
the strongly clustered galaxy distribution. The void density proﬁle of
Ly𝛼 absorbers as a function of scaled voidcentric distance, shown in
Figure 8, appears consistent with a uniform distribution; the promi-
nent density spike in the lowest bin is not statistically signiﬁcant, as
indicated by the size of the errorbar. On the other hand, there is a sig-
niﬁcant density enhancement of Ly𝛼 absorbers close to the void-wall
boundary, as shown in Figure 6, which plots the void density proﬁle
of Ly𝛼 absorbers as a function of distance to cosmic walls. This
density enhancement near void boundaries shows that Ly𝛼 absorbers
are not randomly distributed inside voids. A similar, possibly related
rise in density appears near void boundaries in the density proﬁle of
galaxies shown in Figure 6.

We conclude that there are two populations of Ly𝛼 absorbers in-
side voids: one with a spatial distribution that appears nearly random,
and another associated with galaxies near the edges of voids. This
interpretation is supported by our analysis of the cumulative dis-
tribution function of Ly𝛼 absorbers inside voids. Their cumulative
distribution is close to random, but slightly skewed toward the void

compared with Nobs (r/ Rv < 1/2), the number inside the inner eighth of void volume (within half the void radius), and Nran (r/ Rv < 1/2), the number expected
from the fractions of sight line randoms and survey randoms inside a scaled voidcentric distance of 1/2. Our set of 36 AGN sight lines samples a higher fraction
of the interior void volume. This is why the expected fraction of void absorbers in each quartile is higher than 1/8. Void galaxies are signiﬁcantly less centrally
concentrated than expected for a random distribution. For void absorbers we observe that the lowest column density quartile Q1 is more centrally concentrated,
with the lowest quartile of column density being overrepresented in void centers compared to a random distribution. Conversely, the highest column density
absorbers are underrepresented in void centers.

in underdense regions that are too small to be classiﬁed as voids by
the VoidFinder algorithm (the maximal sphere radius cannot be less
than 10 h-1 Mpc). By contrast, the absorbers associated with galaxies
include both low and high column density systems.

Previous research has also suggested there may be two populations
of IGM clouds detected in Ly𝛼 absorption. Wilde et al. (2021) found
that high column density absorbers (NHI > 1014 cm-2) are usually
close enough to be physically associated with a galaxy (within two
virial radii of a galaxy). Weaker Ly 𝛼 absorbers were more widely dis-
tributed, probably because they tend to be associated with extended
large-scale structure but not particular galaxies or galaxy groups.
Tejos et al. (2012), a study of HST/STIS absorbers in SDSS DR7,
proposed that there are three populations of Ly𝛼 absorbers associ-
ated with galaxies, overdense large-scale structure, and underdense
large-scale structure. They noted that absorbers in underdense large-
scale structure, or the interior volume of voids, may not be randomly
distributed.

Ly 𝛼 absorption primarily traces a diﬀuse phase of the IGM,
deﬁned by (Kitayama & Suto 1996) as being below a threshold tem-
perature (T<105) and threshold density,

(Davé et al.

2010;
Rodríguez Medrano et al. 2021) suggest
this diﬀuse phase
constitutes about 40 per cent of the IGM. Hotter, more ionized
phases are weak in Ly 𝛼, but may be traced by the O VI absorption
line. Thus the spatial distribution of Ly 𝛼 absorbers depends not
only on the baryon distribution, but also the ionisation fraction of
intergalactic hydrogen. Environmental conditions in the interiors
of voids, namely isolation from the eﬀects of shock-heating
from structure formation and adiabatic super-Hubble expansion,
cool and lower the ionisation fraction of intergalactic hydrogen.
Hydrodynamic simulations by Cen (2011) show that shock heating
of halo gas in dense wall regions prevents most of it from cooling
within the current age of the universe. This likely explains why
voids have more Ly 𝛼 absorbers than walls, despite the fact that they
contain less gas by mass.

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant over-representation of HST/COS absorbers
in the lowest quartile of column density inside the interior eighth of
void volume (compared to a random distribution), which suggests that

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

there could be a special population of low column density absorbers
created by cold and diﬀuse hydrogen near the centers of voids. This
population could contribute to the peak in the density proﬁle of Ly𝛼
absorbers near the void center, in the lowest bin of Figure 8, although
as noted previously, the peak is not statistically signiﬁcant. Results
from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations also suggest that cold,
neutral hydrogen gas is preferentially found near void centres, where
there is no shock-heating from structure formation. Kreckel et al.
(2011), a study of galaxies in the Enzo simulation (Bryan 1999),
found that low-luminosity dwarf galaxies are over-represented near
the centre of the void region. A more recent cosmological simula-
tion using over a thousand voids by Rodríguez Medrano et al. (2021)
found that most intergalactic hydrogen in the interiors of voids exists
in a diﬀuse, low temperature phase (T<1015 K), which is strong in
Ly 𝛼 absorption.

We have focused our examination on Ly 𝛼 absorption systems,
but note that metal absorption components present in HST/COS
AGN spectra can provide a fuller picture of the gas conditions in
voids. Since intergalactic hydrogen is highly ionised, it is mostly
undetectable in FUV absorption. Stocke et al. (2019), a spectro-
scopic study of gas associated with galaxy groups in the FUV,
failed to detect a diﬀuse intergroup medium that would complete
the baryon census. Nicastro et al. (2018) claimed detection of these
missing baryons through x-ray spectroscopy. The missing baryons
are a hot phase of the WHIM (𝑇 = 105.7 − 106.3 𝐾) located in
large galaxy overdensities. Complex feedback between the IGM,
CGM, and galaxies shape their evolution. Matter circulated from the
IGM into galaxies fuels star formation (Erb 2008; Prochaska & Wolfe
2009; Genzel et al. 2010). Supernovae and AGN feedback cause gas
outﬂow from galaxies into the CGM and ultimately IGM, altering
their primordial composition by introducing metals (e.g. Madau et al.
2001; Pallottini et al. 2014; Bower et al. 2006). We note that three
O VI components, which trace WHIM, fall within the footprint and
redshift limit of our SDSS DR7 void catalog. Two of these are inside
voids, and one is well within the void interior, at a scaled voidcentric
distance of less than a half.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We characterize the spatial distribution and intrinsic properties of
HST/COS Ly 𝛼 absorbers within voids detected in the nearby vol-
ume mapped by SDSS DR7. These voids ﬁll 68 per cent of the survey
volume, and contain a comparable fraction of absorbers, but only a
ﬁfth of the galaxies. The void density proﬁle of all Ly 𝛼 absorbers
as a function of scaled voidcentric distance appears consistent with a
uniform distribution in the interiors of voids. Similarly, the cumula-
tive distribution function of Ly 𝛼 absorbers inside voids shows they
are similar to a random distribution, but have a slight tendency to

reside close to the edges of voids. In detail, the spatial distribution of
absorbers inside voids depends on HI column density. Absorbers in
the lowest quartile of HI column density are more centrally concen-
trated in the deep interiors of voids, whereas absorbers in the highest
quartile of column density are skewed toward the void wall bound-
aries. Near the void-wall boundary, we ﬁnd a slight but statistically
signiﬁcant enhancement in Ly 𝛼 absorber density, in the same region
where galaxy density prominently rises to form the walls that bound
voids. We interpret these ﬁndings in terms of two populations of
Ly 𝛼 absorbers in the low-redshift universe. One is associated with
galaxies and covers the full range of column density. This population
is likely to include gas that is in the diﬀuse IGM phase as well as
some WHIM as deﬁned by Davé et al. (2010). The other population
of absorbers is more uniformly distributed, consists only of lower
column density systems (logNHI < 14.5), and is likely to be purely
in the diﬀuse IGM phase.
