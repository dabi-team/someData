Abstract  -  Introduction  of  DevOps  into  the  software  development  life  cycle  represents  a  cultural  shift  in  the  IT  culture, 
amalgamating development and operations to improve delivery speed in a rapid and maintainable manner. At the same time, 
security  threats  and  breaches  are  expected  to  grow  as  more  enterprises  move  to  new  agile  frameworks  for  rapid  product 
delivery. Meanwhile, DevSecOps is a mindset change that revolutionizes software development by embedding security at each 
step  of  the  software  cycle,  leading  to  resilient  software.  This  paper  discusses  a  framework  organization  can  use  to  embed 
DevSecOps swiftly and efficiently into the general IT culture. 

Keywords  -  Agile  framework,  Continuous  Deployment,  DevOps,  Mean  time  to  Acknowledge  (MTTA),  Mean  time  to 
Resolution(MTTR) 

1. Introduction  

DevOps  is  defined  as  the  intersection  of  Development 
and  Operations  and  is  a  major  cultural  change  in  the  tech 
industry.  This  marriage  has  created  great  strides  towards  a 
mutual  trust  relationship  between  the  two.  No  industry  can 
change  overnight  but  being  aware  and  adopting  DevOps 
early is an important skill set that goes a long way. DevOps 
is  understanding  the  software  and  learning  to  code  while 
learning to operate and maintain that code simultaneously. It 
is crucial to remember that all it takes is one security breach 
for the customers to lose trust in any enterprise. Hence, it is 
important to focus on maintaining high-security standards. 

According  to Gartner's  research-  “It  is  estimated  that  at 
least 95% of cloud security failures through 2022 will be the 
fault  of  the  enterprise,”.  Therefore,  while  developing  any 
application, the developer must not have loose ends that may 
make  an  enterprise  vulnerable  to  such  attacks.  With  the 
recent  trends  of  increasing  security  threats  and  breaches,  an 
enterprise must be vested in the security of applications from 
the  start  of  the  development  cycle.  Gartner  predicts  that 
“30%  of  Critical 
Infrastructure  Organizations  Will 
Experience a Security Breach by 2025” [1]. It is what has led 
to  the  introduction  of  DevSecOps  in  a  lot  of  enterprises. 
Gartner defines  DevSecOps as  -  “the  integration of  security 
into  emerging  agile  IT  and  DevOps  development  as 
seamlessly  and  as  transparently  as  possible.  Ideally,  this  is 
done  without  reducing  the  agility  or  speed  of  developers  or 
requiring 
toolchain 
environment.”

application development and operations, along with bringing

applications.  With  DevSecOps,  the  development  process 
needs  to  look  at  security  proactively  rather  than  reactively. 
The development  cycle will  embed  security  testing  and bug 
fixes  to  expose  security vulnerabilities  early  in  the  software 
lifecycle.  It  has  paved  the  way  for  innovation,  efficient 
developer  velocity,  and  rapid  release  cycles  while  keeping 
security a top priority. It has helped with faster development, 
rapid release of features, and the power of agile practices. 

An  imperative  question  here  is  whether  security  lapses 
only occur because of technical failures. In a recent Gartner 
study of 367 IT and business leaders, it was found that 50% 
of  the  issues  involved  people,  followed  by  process  (37%), 
technology  (8%),  and  information  (5%).  Therefore,  it  is 
important  to  look  at  DevSecOps  from  a  holistic  perspective 
instead of focusing on a narrow area. 

to 

Gartner  mentions,  “DevOps  emphasizes  people  (and 
improve  collaboration  between 
culture)  and  seeks 
operations  and  development  teams.”  Microsoft’s  Donovan 
Brown  defines  it  as:  “The  union  of  people,  processes,  and 
products  to  enable  continuous  delivery  of  value  to  our  end 
users.” Hence, it is very important to recruit the right set of 
individuals who will help champion DevSecOps adoption. 

Although  enterprises  have  made  significant  strides  in 
adopting  new  business  practices  like  moving  to  cloud 
providers,  using  agile  frameworks,  etc.,  organizationally, 
DevSecOps  is  often  given  the  least  priority  in  the  minds  of 
stakeholders.  DevSecOps  initiatives  often  don’t  have  a 
framework  to  follow;  especially  those  executives  can  buy.       
Gartner  predicts  that 
through  2022,  75%  of  DevOps 
initiatives will fail to meet expectations due to organizational 
learning and change issues.

Several  large  companies  such  as  Amazon,  Google,  and 
Netflix have adopted DevSecOps to create a high-performing 
organization and a platform for continuous improvement. 

Fig. 1 DevSecOps Concept   

1.1. DevOps vs. DevSecOps 

Both  in  the  core  share  the  idea  of  a  mindset  change  to 
focus  on  development  and  operations.  DevSecOps  is  an 
extension of DevOps to bring in the aspect of security early 
in the development cycle and plan for security mishaps once 
the  deployment  is  done  to  production.  DevSecOps  not  only 
deals  with  creating  a  maintainable  &  operational 
infrastructure  but  also  addresses  the  fact  that  security 
vulnerabilities  are  inevitable  if  enough  focus  is  not  paid  to 
security in the early stages of software development.                                       

2. DevSecOps Adoption Framework  

Enterprise  adoption of DevSecOps is  a  long multi-year 
journey,  and  starting  early  on  will  help  the  organization  in 
the  long  run.  There  is  a  lot  of  material  available  to  bring 
awareness about DevOps and why one should adopt it. Still, 
little  information  is  available  that  talks  about  DevSecOps 
and  a  cohesive  framework  that  organizations  could  use  to 
adopt  DevSecOps  seamlessly.  This  paper  focuses  on 
covering  this  gap  and  sharing  a  DevSecOps  adoption 
framework. 

in 

The 

first 

step 

journey 

2.1. Understanding the need for DevSecOps  
the  DevSecOps 

is 
understanding what DevSecOps is and why we need it fully. 
Once  the  understanding  of  DecSecOps  is  established,  the 
focus should be on evaluating who and how will benefit from 
the  adoption.  It  will  involve  a  solid  assessment  of  the 
business  use  case,  resources,  and  the  current  pain  points  of 
the organization. In this phase, be transparent with tech debt, 
defects,  and  bugs.  It  will  help  identify  improvements  and 

opportunities to determine the defects' root cause. It will help 
identify the current applications and processes gaps and help 
evaluate  the  opportunities.  For  example,  an  opportunity  to 
move  a  manual  job  of  filtering  a  few  parameters  from  an 
excel to automating it to run a script for you will save a lot of 
time and will not be prone to human error. 

Key questions one should ask to evaluate this are: 

1.  What is DevSecOps? 
2.  How will the organization benefit from DevSecOps, 

given the time and resources to spend on it? 

3.  What  are  the  major  pain  points  we  are  trying  to 

address as part of this change? 

4.  What  will  be  our  success  criteria  to  evaluate  our 

progress? 

5.  Which applications will be part of the scope of this 

adoption? 

6.  What timelines would we like to consider as we go 

through this journey? 

7.  How will it impact our other security initiatives? 
8.  How do we identify the goals to establish a roadmap 

to adopt DevSecOps? 

2.2. Recruit champions/ambassadors of DevSecOps 

The  next  step  is  to  identify  a  set  of  ambassadors  or 
champions  who  are  aligned  and  believe  in  the  mission  of 
DevSecOps in the organization. It is an opportunity to bring 
passionate people to volunteer for the program who can bring 
fresh  ideas  to  the  table.  One  should  use  several  channels  to 
promote the opportunity in the organization so you can have 
a  team  of  people  from  diverse  backgrounds  like  engineers, 
operations,  security  specialists,  testers,  and  managers.  One 
should  look  for  individuals  who  are  motivated,  passionate 
about  learning,  can  thrive  in  ambiguity,  and  are  good  team 
players.  These 
to 
communicate  and  collaborate  on  a  continued  basis.  They 
should  fully  understand  their  role  and responsibilities  in  the 
DevSecOps journey. This cohort will help bring the mission 
to  life  and  advocate  for  the  cause  to  help  with  a  broader 
DevSecOps  adoption  in  the  enterprise.  In  this  phase,  we 
provide  training  (in-house  or  through  external  vendors)  to 
this  cohort  to  help  upskill  them  and  prepare  them  for  the 
journey ahead. 

individuals  should  feel  empowered 

Few key questions to ask as you embark on the journey 

to recruit these individuals are: 

1.  What  are  the  key  duties  and  responsibilities  of  the 

champions or ambassadors of DevSecOps? 

2.  How  many  champions  should  we  recruit  first,  to 

begin? 

3.  Are there other technical skill sets we need to look 

for as we recruit the champions? 

4.  Will this group work together and collaborate on the 

initiative?

2.3. Develop a DevSecOps Strategy 

Developing a DevSecOps strategy is the core of bringing 
an  organization-wide  change  with  DevSecOps.  Every 
individual  involved  will  keep  a  ‘security-first’  mindset  and 
involve  security  best  practices  from  the  get-go.  As  you 
develop the strategy, keep in mind priority, the cost of time 
and  resources,  and  ensure  the  effort  is  time-boxed  for 
successful  implementation.  The  strategy  will  help  bring 
alignment  regarding  what  needs  to  be  accomplished  as  part 
of the adoption. 

Key  tenets  to  keep  in  mind  as  you  develop  the 

DevSecOps strategy: 

1. 

‘Security-first’ mindset - Each person involved will be 
responsible  for  keeping  security  as  one  of  the  top 
priorities. Hence, as part of the software development 
lifecycle,  developers  will  be  accountable  for  security 
during  development  and  bug  fixes  of  security 
vulnerabilities.  Similarly,  the  operations  team  will 
have  run  books  to  combat  security  threats  once  the 
applications are deployed to production. 

2.  Automation  -  As  part  of  a  strategy,  focus  on 
identifying  opportunities  where  manual  tasks  can  be 
automated  to  save  time  and  ensure  our  systems  are 
less prone to human errors. 

3.  Continuous  integration,  continuous  deployment  (CI-
CD)-  CI-CD  is  the  pinnacle  of  DevOps,  where  the 
systems around your application are strong enough to 
test  the  code  changes  for  you  and  push  them  to 
production  without 
intervention. 
DevSecOps  helps  eliminate  long  testing  cycles  and 
leads  to  shorter  iterations  with  faster  releases;  early 
feedback  in  the  software  development  lifecycle  is  a 
key  underpinning  factor  to  help  us  get  to  the 
appropriate path or direction as early as possible. 

any  manual 

Now that we looked at the key tenets of such a strategy, 

some key questions your strategy should answer are: 

1.  How  should  your  organization  start  implementing 

DevSecOps? 

2.  What channels will be created to bring awareness to 

the organization? 

3.  What  are  the  short-term  and  long-term  plans  to 

bring adoption? 

4.  How will success be measured? 

2.4. Communicate to leadership to get buy-in 

Leadership  and  executives  will  play  a  critical  role  in 
promoting  and  adopting  DevSecOps.  Hence,  it  is  of  utmost 
importance  to  get  a  buy-in  from  them  to  ensure  no  other 
business Objective-Key-Result (OKR) impedes the adoption 
of DevSecOps in the organization. It is where you will share 
the strategy with the leadership and make them aware of the 
initial setup costs in terms of time, money, and resources. At 

21 

the same time, this is an opportunity to share about long-term 
rewards and their impact on the organization. 

Key questions that should be answered in this stage are: 
1. 
Is  the  leadership  aligned  with  the  strategy  and  the 
time commitment? 

2.  How soon can we get the plan to action? 

2.5  Execution 

The  core  of  the  work  begins  in  the  execution  phase. 
Time is of the essence; hence it is important to start small, 
collect feedback, and iterate. In this phase, we evaluate the 
tools  available  to  help  speed  up  the  adoption.  Some  tools 
that can help kickstart this process are: 

•  OWASP 
•  SonarQube 
•  Fortify 
•  HashiCorp Vault 

Since  each  organization  is  different,  use  this  phase  to 
create a proof of concept (POCs) to see what works best for 
your organization. It will involve a thorough assessment of 
solutions for the pain points identified above. 

A  few  key  questions  that  should  be  answered  at  this 

stage are: 
1. 

Instead of doing this as a one-off item, how do you 
integrate  DevSecOps 
the  existing 
developer infrastructure? 

tools 

into 

2.  What guardrails can be set up to ensure developers 

cannot bypass these systems? 

3.  How do you ensure that product delivery speed is 
not hampered by introducing these systems? 

2.6  Audit and measure success 

in 

for 

feedback 

continual 

Feedback  is  a  critical  aspect  of  human  life.  As  a  child, 
we  grow  up  with  continuous  feedback  from  our  parents, 
which  is  instrumental  in  learning  life  skills.  Similarly,  we 
the  DevSecOps 
should  ensure  constant 
improvement.  Alarms, 
environment 
Dashboards and monitoring through alerts are a good way to 
audit  the  applications  and  be  proactive  in  scenarios  if 
something  goes  wrong.  It  is  a  good  chance  to  do  a 
retrospective with the team to see what we did well and what 
can  be  improved  as  a  team.  At  the  same  time,  establish  an 
ongoing  feedback  mechanism  such  as  quarterly  or  channels 
where  employees  can  reach  out  to  provide  feedback.  It  can 
be done in the form of Agile retro or surveys for individuals 
to fill in. We should ensure governance and guardrails are in 
place  as  we  measure  the  success  of  the  adoption  of 
DevSecOps. As we measure success, ensure you don’t over-
engineer  measurements  and  instead  focus  on  being  result-
oriented.

Fig. 2 DevSecOps Adoption Framework  

A few key metrics to keep in mind are: 
•  Response times and performance of applications 
•  Mean time to plan, deploy and deliver 
•  MTTA (mean time to acknowledge) in times of high 

severity event 

•  MTTR (mean time to resolution) in times of high 

severity event 

•  Quality of audit reports around open bugs, trouble 

tickets, deployment reports 
Increased deployment frequency 

• 

Based on the feedback gathered in this phase, iterate on the 
feedback, and go back to execute. 

3.Conclusion 

 The framework shared above provides a structured and 
organized  approach  that  enterprises  can  use  to  adopt 
DevSecOps  practices.  It  helps  guide  an  organization  to 
succeed in its journey to adopt DevSecOps. It will help build 
secure  software from  its  inception. Investments  made  in  the 
short term will help the organization with long-term goals to 
ship  better,  faster,  and  more  secure  products 
the 
customers.  Feedback  mechanisms  will  help  with  continual 
improvement 
this 
framework,  organizations  can  ensure  that  common  pitfalls 
for  DevSecOps  are  avoided  and  ensure  that  introduction  of 
DevSecOps  is  a  cultural  shift  in  the  development  process 
instead of a one-time work.
