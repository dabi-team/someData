ABSTRACT
Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range
of applications. The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern
of their dependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-
making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to
be repaired. The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security
concerns or unjust societal impacts. In this work, we address the
problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such
as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to construct a
neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting
the given neural network’s parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically,
we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based neu-
ral network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault
localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the
parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior. We
have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor
removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties.
Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neu-
ral networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks,
CARE successfully improves fairness by 61.91% on average. For
backdoor removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from
over 98% to less than 1%. For safety property repair tasks, CARE
reduces the property violation rate to less than 1%. Results also
show that thanks to the causality-based fault localization, CARE’s
repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of
the neural networks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range
of applications, ranging from medical diagnosis [66], facial recog-
nition [53], fraud detection [19] and self-driving [6]. While neural
networks are demonstrating excellent performance, there has been
a growing concern on whether they are reliable and dependable.
Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks

inevitably have defects and need to be repaired at times. Neural
networks are usually inherently black-boxes and do not provide
explanations on how and why decisions are made in certain ways.
As a result, these defects are more “hidden" compared to tradi-
tional decision-making programs [5, 17, 23]. It is thus crucial to
develop systematic ways to make sure defects in a neural network
are repaired and desirable properties are satisfied.

Similar to the activity known as debugging for traditional soft-
ware programs, there is often a need to modify a neural network to
fix certain aspects of its behavior (whilst maintaining other function-
alities). Existing efforts to repair the unexpected behavior of neural
networks often focus on retraining with additional data [43, 44].
Although retraining is natural and often effective, retraining a neu-
ral network model could be difficult and expensive for real-world
applications [23]. More importantly, unlike debugging traditional
software program (where we can be reasonably certain that the bug
is eliminated after the ‘fix’), there is no guarantee that the retrained
model eliminates the unwanted behavior. Therefore, techniques for
modifying an existing model without retraining will be preferable in
certain scenarios. That is, we sometimes would like to apply a small
modification on an existing neural network to remove unexpected
behaviors whilst retaining most of its well-trained behaviors.

Neural networks may misbehave in different ways. Given a
model trained primarily for accuracy, it could be discriminative, i.e.,
the prediction is more favourable to certain groups thus violating
fairness property. In this situation, small adjustment can be applied
to the trained network without retraining, i.e., to improve its fair-
ness whilst maintaining the model’s accuracy. In another scenario,
malicious hidden functionalities (backdoor) could be easily embed-
ded into a neural network if the training data is poisoned [42, 67].
Such a backdoor produces unexpected behavior if a specific trigger
is added to an input, whilst presenting normal behavior on clean
inputs. In this scenario, one would like to repair the neural network
by removing the backdoor while maintaining the correct behavior
on clean inputs. A further scenario is that a trained model could
violate safety-critical properties on certain inputs, e.g., the output
is not within the expected range [33, 34]. In this case, we would
like to repair the network by making adjustments to its parameters
so that the repaired model satisfies the specified property.

For both traditional software programs and neural networks,
debugging and repairing are essentially reasoning over causality.
For traditional software programs, the notion of causality is natural
and well defined [9, 28, 32], e.g., based on (control and data) depen-
dency. However, the same is not true for neural networks, i.e., a
wrong decision could easily be the collective result of all neurons in
the network and yet considering that all of them are ‘responsible’
and should be modified is unlikely to be helpful. Although causality
analysis has been applied to interpret machine learning models [8]

and verification [71], existing causality analysis typically focuses
on the causal relation from the input to the model prediction, and
not the hidden neurons. Hence it is still not clear how to apply
existing definitions of causality for repairing neural networks. In
other words, how to repair a neural network to remedy defects
based on causality is still largely an open problem.

In this work, we introduce CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a
general automatic repair algorithm for neural networks. Instead of
retraining, CARE applies minor modifications to a given model’s
parameters (i.e., weights) to repair known defects whilst maintain-
ing the model’s accuracy. The defects are defined based on desirable
properties that the given neural network fails to satisfy. CARE is
a search-based automated program repair technique that first per-
forms fault localization based on causal attribution of each neuron,
i.e., it locates those neurons that have the most contribution to
the model’s defects. Secondly, CARE performs automatic repair
by adjusting model parameters related to the identified neurons
until the resultant model satisfies the specified property (whilst
maintaining accuracy).

We summarize our contributinos as follows.

• We propose and implement CARE as a general automatic re-
pair algorithm, that applies causality-based fault localization
and PSO optimization to all layers of neural networks.
• We demonstrate the effectiveness of CARE in the context of
three different tasks: 1) fairness improvement, 2) backdoor
removal and 3) safety property violation repair.

• We empirically evaluate CARE on multiple neural networks
including feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) and convo-
lutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on multiple bench-
mark datasets. The results indicate that CARE improves the
models’ performance over the specified properties signifi-
cantly and CARE outperforms existing approaches proposed
for neural network repair.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we review relevant background and define our problem. In Section 3,
we present each step of our approach in detail. In Section 4, we
evaluate our approach through multiple experiments to answer
multiple research questions. We review related work in Section 5
and conclude in Section 6.

2 PRELIMINARY
In this section, we review relevant background and define our
research problem.

2.1 Neural Network Properties
There are many desirable properties we would like a trained neural
network to satisfy besides meeting its accuracy requirement. In
this work, we assume 𝜙 to be one of the following three kinds of
properties and show that CARE can handle all of them.

Fairness: Fairness is a desirable property that potentially has sig-
nificant societal impact [47]. Due to the fact that machine learning
models are data-driven and the training data could be biased (or
imbalanced), models trained based on such data could be discrimi-
native [4, 63]. In this work, we define independence-based fairness
following [61] as follows.

Definition 2.1 (Independence-based Fairness). Let 𝑁 be a
neural network and 𝜉 be a positive real-value constant. We write
𝑌 as the prediction of 𝑁 on a set of input features 𝑋 and 𝐿 as the
prediction set. We further write 𝐹 ⊆ 𝑋 as a feature encoding some
protected characteristics such as gender, age and race. 𝑁 satisfies
independence-based fairness, with respect to 𝜉, if and only if, ∀𝑙 ∈
𝐿 ∀𝑓𝑖, 𝑓𝑗 ∈ 𝐹 𝑠𝑢𝑐ℎ 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗,

| 𝑃 (𝑌 = 𝑙 | 𝐹 = 𝑓𝑖 ) − 𝑃 (𝑌 = 𝑙 | 𝐹 = 𝑓𝑗 ) | ≤ 𝜉

(1)

Intuitively, Definition 2.1 states that, 𝑁 is fair as long as the
probability difference of a favourable prediction for instances with
different values of protected feature is within the threshold 𝜉.

Absence of backdoor: With the wide adoption of neural networks
in critical decision-making systems, sharing and adopting trained
models become very popular. On the other hand, this gives attackers
new opportunities. Backdoor attack is one of the neural network
attacks that often cause significant threats to the system. Backdoor
is a hidden pattern trained into a neural network, which produces
unexpected behavior if and only if a specific trigger is added to
an input [67]. In classification tasks, the backdoor misclassifies
an arbitrary inputs to the same target label, when the associated
trigger is applied to the input. Hence another desirable property
of a neural network would be ’backdoor free’, where the backdoor
attack success rate is kept below a certain threshold.

Definition 2.2 (Backdoor Attack Success Rate). Let 𝑁 be
a backdoored neural network, 𝑡 be the target label, 𝑋 be a set of
adversarial inputs with the trigger and 𝑁 (𝑥) be the prediction on 𝑥.
We say attack success rate (SR) is:

𝑆𝑅(𝑡) = 𝑃 (𝑁 (𝑥) = 𝑡 |𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 )

(2)

Intuitively, attack success rate is the percentage of adversarial
inputs classified into the target label. Next, we define backdoor-free
neural network.

Definition 2.3 (Backdoor-free Neural Network). Let 𝑁 be a
backdoored neural network and 𝜉 be a positive real-value constant. 𝑁
satisfies backdoor-free property with respect to 𝜉 and 𝑡, if 𝑆𝑅(𝑡) < 𝜉.
Safety: For neural networks applied on safety-critical systems such
as the Airborne Collision Avoidance [33] system, all safety proper-
ties must be satisfied strictly. However, due to reasons like limited
training data and insufficient training, those critical properties
could be violated. Hence, another desirable behavior of a neural
network is to satisfy all safety properties or the violation rate is
kept below a certain threshold.

Definition 2.4 (Safety Property Violation Rate). Let 𝑁 be
a neural network, 𝑋 be a set of inputs and 𝑁 (𝑥) be the prediction on
𝑥. Let 𝜌 be the critical safety property that 𝑁 is expected to satisfy.
We say the property violation rate (VR) is:

𝑉 𝑅(𝜌) = 𝑃 (𝑁 (𝑥) ⊭ 𝜌 | 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 )

(3)

Intuitively, violation success rate is the percentage of inputs that
violate the property 𝜌. Next, we define safety property violation-
free neural network.

Definition 2.5 (Safety Property Violation-free Neural
Network). Let 𝑁 be a neural network and 𝜉 be a positive real-value

Causality-Based Neural Network Repair

constant. 𝑁 is safety property violation-free with respect to 𝜉 and 𝜌,
if 𝑉 𝑅(𝜌) < 𝜉.

Example 2.1. We train a feed-forward neural network 𝑁 on Cen-
sus Income dataset (refer to details of the dataset in Section 4.1) to
predict whether an individual’s income exceeds $50K per year. The
neural network is configured to have 5 hidden layers. We use this
network as the running example in this paper. In this example, we
focus on a fairness property 𝜙 w.r.t. protected feature gender, i.e., the
model is considered unfair if the probability difference of a favourable
prediction for females and males is greater than 1%. Note that this
is for illustration purpose only and such a threshold is probably too
strict for real-world applications. Given this neural network, the prob-
lem is to find a repaired network 𝑀 with minimal adjustment to 𝑁 ’s
weight parameters so that 𝑀 satisfies the fairness property whilst
maintaining its accuracy.

2.2 Our Problem
We are now ready to define our problem.

Definition 2.6 (Neural Network Repair Problem). Let 𝑁 be
a neural network, 𝑆 be the input space, and 𝜙 be one of the above-
mentioned desirable properties. The neural network repair problem is
to construct a neural network 𝑀 such that 𝑀 satisfies 𝜙 in the input
space 𝑆 and the semantic distance between 𝑁 and 𝑀 is minimized.
We define semantic distance between two neural networks 𝑁

and 𝑀 as follows.

Definition 2.7 (Semantic Distance). Let 𝑁 (𝑥) be the prediction
of neural network 𝑁 on input 𝑥 where 𝑥 ∈ 𝑆, the semantic distance
between 𝑁 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑀 is defined as:

𝑃 (𝑁 (𝑥) ≠ 𝑀 (𝑥))

(4)

Intuitively, the semantic distance between two neural networks
is the probability that the predictions of the two models are differ-
ent on the same input. In this work, we use the model accuracy
difference of 𝑁 and 𝑀 as a measure of their semantic distance.

3 OUR APPROACH
In this section, we present the details of our approach. An overview
of our framework is as shown in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1 shows
the details of our approach. The first step is to verify whether the
given neural network 𝑁 satisfy property 𝜙. If 𝜙 is satisfied, CARE
terminates immediately. Otherwise, CARE proceeds to the next step.
It performs causality-based fault localization on all hidden neurons
of 𝑁 and identifies those neurons that have the most contribution to
𝑁 ’s unwanted behavior. The third step is to optimize these neurons’
weights and generate a repaired network 𝑀 such that 𝑀 satisfies
the property 𝜙 and is semantically close to 𝑁 .

3.1 Property Verification
In this step, we verify neural network 𝑁 against given property
𝜙. If 𝑁 satisfies 𝜙, CARE returns 𝑁 unchanged and terminates.
Otherwise, CARE proceeds to repair the neural network. Property
verification is not the focus of this work and we adopt existing
neural network verification techniques. Recently there have been
multiple tools and approaches for solving the above-mentioned

neural network verification problems. We omit the details on how
different properties are verified and refer the readers to [5, 34, 35,
61]. In our implementation, CARE’s fairness verification algorithm
is based on [61], backdoor success rate verification is based on the
method proposed in [67] and safety property verification is based
on the approach proposed in [59].

Example 3.1. In our running example, CARE verifies 𝑁 against the
fairness property 𝜙. The resultant fairness score (i.e., the probability
difference of a favourable prediction for females and males) is 1.30%.
Therefore, 𝑁 fails to satisfy the fairness property (which requires the
fairness score to be within 1%).

3.2 Causality Analysis
In this step we perform causality-based fault localization. The goal is
to identify a relatively small set of neurons to repair. Note that in this
work, we restrict ourselves to repair by adjusting the parameters of
existing neurons only, i.e., without introducing or pruning neurons.
The number of parameters in a neural network is often huge and
even relatively small neural network may consist of thousands of
weight and bias parameters. Therefore, attempting to optimize all
neural weights would be costly and hard to scale. CARE thus adopts
a fault localization method to identify neurons that are likely to be
responsible for the undesirable behaviors. This method is based on
causality analysis carried out over all hidden neurons of 𝑁 .

An alternative method for fault localization is gradient-based
method, which is to measure how much perturbing a particular
neuron would affect the output [57]. CARE is designed to capture
the causal influence of a hidden neuron on the performance on the
given property. In contrast, gradient-based method draws conclu-
sion based on statistical correlations, which is not ideal for model
repair (since our aim is to identify neurons that cause the defect).
Next, we describe our causality-based fault localization in detail.

In recent years, causality has gained increasing attention in
interpreting machine learning models [8, 27]. Multiple approaches
have been designed to explain the importance of the components
in a machine learning model when making a decision, based on
causal attributions. Compared with traditional methods, causal
approaches identify causes and effects of a model’s components
and thus facilitates reasoning over its decisions.

In the following, we review some concepts which are necessary

for the causality analysis in this work.

Definition 3.1 (Structural Causal Models (SCM) [48]). A
Structural Causal Model (SCM) is a 4-tuple 𝑀 (𝑋, 𝑈 , 𝑓 , 𝑃𝑢 ) where X is
a finite set of endogenous variables, U denotes a finite set of exogenous
variables, f is a set of functions {𝑓1, 𝑓2, ..., 𝑓𝑛 } where each function
represents a causal mechanism such that ∀𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝑋, 𝑥𝑖 = 𝑓𝑖 (𝑃𝑎(𝑥𝑖 ), 𝑢𝑖 )
where 𝑃𝑎(𝑥𝑖 ) is a subset of 𝑋 \ {𝑥𝑖 }, 𝑢𝑖 ∈ 𝑈 and 𝑃𝑢 is a probability
distribution over 𝑈 .

SCM serves as a framework for representing what we know
about the world, articulating what we want to know and connecting
the two together in a solid semantics [49]. It plays an important role
in causality analysis and is commonly applied in many studies [8,
45, 46, 73].

Figure 2 shows an example causal graph to study the efficiency
of a medication on a disease, where the nodes represent variables
and the edges represent cause-effect relations intuitively. In this
graph, age is considered as an exogenous variable (i.e., confounder),
patient’s heart rate, cholesterol level and whether the medication
is applied or not are endogenous variables (i.e., whether the medi-
cation is applied or not is often considered as the treatment). The
outcome is the recovery rate of a patient. As illustrated in the graph,
age affects the patient’s health conditions such as heart rate and
level of cholesterol. Furthermore, the need or feasibility of applying
this medicine on patients is affected by age, i.e., young people may
not necessarily take the medicine and patients above 70 years old
are too risky to take the medicine. Patient’s health condition and
the application of medication affect the recovery rate. Furthermore,

age can affect the recovery rate directly since younger patient often
recover faster than the elderly.

In this work, we model neural networks as SCMs to analyze
the causal relationship between hidden neurons and model’s pre-
dictions. To debug and repair a neural network, we would like to
measure the ‘contribution’ of each neuron to the network misbe-
havior, which is referred as the causal effect.

Definition 3.2 (Average Causal Effect). The Average Causal
Effect (ACE) of a binary random variable 𝑥 (e.g., treatment), on an-
other random variable 𝑦 (e.g., outcome) is defined as follows.

𝐴𝐶𝐸 = E[𝑦|𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 1)] − E[𝑦|𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 0)]

(5)

where 𝑑𝑜 (·) operator denotes the corresponding interventional distri-
bution defined by SCM.

Intuitively, ACE is used to measure the causal effect of 𝑥 on 𝑦 by
performing intervention on 𝑥. There are many other causal effect
metrics in the literature such as

• average treatment effect (ATE), i.e., 𝐴𝑇 𝐸 = E[𝑦 (1) − 𝑦 (0)],
where 𝑦 (1) represents the potential outcome if a treatment is
applied exogenously and 𝑦 (0) represents the corresponding
potential outcome without treatment. ATE measures the
effect of the treatment at the whole population level [29],
• conditional average treatment effect, i.e., 𝐶𝐴𝑇 𝐸 = E[𝑦 (1) −
𝑦 (0)|𝑥0] [1], which is the average treatment effect condi-
tioned on a particular subgroup of 𝑋 , i.e., 𝑋 = 𝑥0,

• and effect of treatment on the treated, i.e., 𝐸𝑇𝑇 = E[𝑦𝑥1 |𝑥0]−
𝐸 [𝑦|𝑥0] which measures the probability of 𝑌 would be 𝑦 had
𝑋 been 𝑥1 counterfactually, given that in the actual world
𝑋 = 𝑥0 [71].

In this work, we focus on the ACE metric since we are interested
in measuring the causal effect of the hidden neurons on certain
output value.

3.3 Fault Localization
In the following, we present details on how causality analysis is
used for fault localization in neural networks. Firstly, the neural
network 𝑁 is modeled as an SCM. As proposed in [38], neural
networks can be interpreted as SCMs systematically. In particular,
feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) and convolutional neural
networks(CNNs) can be represented as directed acyclic graphs with

edges from an earlier (i.e., closer to the input layer) layer to the
next layer until the output layer. The following is a proposition.

Proposition 3.1. An 𝑛-layer FFNN or CNN 𝑁 (𝑥1, 𝑥2, ..., 𝑥𝑛) where
𝑥𝑖 represents the set of neurons at layer 𝑖, can be interpreted by SCM
𝑀 ([𝑥1, 𝑥2, ..., 𝑥𝑛], 𝑈 , [𝑓1, 𝑓2, ..., 𝑓𝑛], 𝑃𝑈 ), where 𝑥1 represents neurons
at input layer and 𝑥𝑛 represents neurons at output layer. Correspond-
ing to every 𝑥𝑖 , 𝑓𝑖 represents the set of causal functions for neurons at
layer 𝑖. 𝑈 represents a set of exogenous random variables that act as
causal factors for input neurons 𝑥1 and 𝑃𝑢 is a probability distribution
over 𝑈 .

Proof. In the scenario of FFNN, the proof of Proposition 3.1 fol-
lows that provided in [8]. In the scenario of CNN, similar to FFNN,
neurons at each layer can be written as functions of neurons at its
previous layer, i.e., ∀𝑖 : ∀𝑥𝑖 𝑗 ∈ 𝑥𝑖 : 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑓𝑖 𝑗 (𝑥𝑖−1), where 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 rep-
resents the 𝑗𝑡ℎ neuron at layer 𝑖. Neurons at input layer (𝑥1) can be
assumed to be functions of independent noise variables 𝑈 such that
∀𝑥1𝑗 ∈ 𝑥1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑢 𝑗 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑥1𝑗 = 𝑓1𝑗 (𝑢 𝑗 ). Thus a CNN can be equiva-
lently expressed by a SCM 𝑀 ([𝑥1, 𝑥2, ..., 𝑥𝑛], 𝑈 , [𝑓1, 𝑓2, ..., 𝑓𝑛], 𝑃𝑈 ).
□

Figure 3 depicts the SCM of a 3-layer FFNN. The dotted circles
represent exogenous random variables which act as causal factors
for the input neurons. In this work, we assume that neurons at the
input layer are not causally related to each other but can be jointly
caused by a latent confounder.

Next we define the attribution problem, i.e., what is the causal
influence of a particular hidden neuron on model defect. Recall
that in Definition 3.2, we define the ACE of a binary variable 𝑥 on
output variable 𝑦. However, we cannot apply the definition directly
for two reasons. First, the domain of neural networks’ neurons is
mostly continuous, not binary-valued. Second, we are interested
in finding causal effects on the model defect rather than certain
output variable. Hence we propose the following definition.

Definition 3.3 (Causal Attribution). We denote the measure
of the undesirable behavior of given neural network 𝑁 as y. The Causal
Attribution of a hidden neuron 𝑥 to 𝑁 ′𝑠 defect 𝑦 is:

𝐴𝐶𝐸𝑦

𝑑𝑜 (𝑥=𝛽) = E[𝑦|𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 𝛽)]

(6)

Next, we calculate the interventional expectation of 𝑦 given

intervention 𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 𝛽) and we thus have the following.

E[𝑦|𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 𝛽)] =

∫

𝑦

𝑦𝑝 (𝑦|𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 𝛽))𝑑𝑦

(7)

Intuitively, causal attribution measures the effect of neuron 𝑥 being
value 𝛽 on 𝑦. We evaluate Equation 7 by sampling inputs according
to their distribution whilst keeping the hidden neuron 𝑥 = 𝛽, and
computing the average model undesirable behavior 𝑦.

In this work, we calculate 𝑦 according to the desirable property
𝜙. Let 𝑁𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑝 ) be the prediction value of class 𝑡 on input 𝑥𝑖𝑝 we
have:

• For fairness repair, we measure model unfairness 𝑦 by tak-
ing the difference of the prediction value on favourable
class 𝑡 w.r.t. samples that only differ by the sensitive feature.
Let 𝑥𝑖𝑝 and 𝑥 ′
𝑖𝑝 be a pair of discriminatory instances [72]
(that only differ by the sensitive feature). We have 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 =
| 𝑁𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑝 ) − 𝑁𝑡 (𝑥 ′
as the
𝑖𝑝 ) | and we calculate 𝐴𝐶𝐸
causal attribution of neuron 𝑥 w.r.t. fairness property.

𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟
𝑑𝑜 (𝑥=𝛽)

• For backdoor removal, we measure 𝑦 by calculating the pre-
diction value on target class 𝑡, i.e, 𝑦𝑏𝑑 = 𝑁𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑝 ). Thus we
aim to calculate 𝐴𝐶𝐸𝑦𝑏𝑑
for all hidden neurons. Note
𝑥𝑖𝑝 can be clean inputs or adversarial inputs.

𝑑𝑜 (𝑥=𝛽)

• For safety property violation repair, we measure 𝑦 by calcu-
lating the prediction value on desirable class 𝑡, i.e., 𝑦𝑠𝑎𝑓 𝑒 =
𝑦𝑠𝑎𝑓 𝑒
as the causal attribution
𝑁𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑝 ). We calculate 𝐴𝐶𝐸
𝑑𝑜 (𝑥=𝛽)
for hidden neuron 𝑥.

For other properties, CARE is able to calculate the causal attribution
of each neuron on 𝑦 as long as the corresponding 𝑦 is specified.

Thus by calculating the causal attribution of each hidden neuron
on 𝑦, we are able to identify neurons that are most likely the cause
to the unexpected behavior. Afterwards, the identified neurons are
used as candidates for model repair in our next step. The time spent
on this step depends on the total number of neurons 𝑛 to analyze in
the given neural network. The time complexity for causality-based
fault localization is thus O(𝑛).

Example 3.2. In our running example, CARE conducts causality-
based fault localization on all hidden neurons of 𝑁 to identify neurons
that are the most “responsible" to 𝑁 ′𝑠 prediction bias. CARE generates
12.4k samples to analyze all neurons and the total time taken is 120s. It
is observed that a few neurons (such as the 11𝑡ℎ neuron at 3𝑟𝑑 hidden
layer and the 3𝑟𝑑 neuron at 5𝑡ℎ hidden layer) have a contribution
which is “outstanding". This is good news to us as it implies that it is
possible to improve the fairness by modifying the weights of only a few
neurons. CARE then selects the top 10% of total number of neurons
(i.e., 13 in total for this network) to be used as repair candidates.

3.4 Network Repair
Next, we present how CARE performs neural network repair. Simi-
lar to traditional software programs, neural networks can go wrong
and incorrect behaviors should be fixed. While existing efforts
mainly focus on how to retrain the neural network to repair the
unexpected behaviors, there are a few recent works [3, 23, 65] that
address this problem by modifying the parameters of the network.

Figure 4: Causal Attribution of Neurons in the Example

In the following, we first briefly explain why these approaches do
not apply in our setting. Goldberger et al. propose a verification-
based method to adjust the neural weights of the output layer only.
Their approach has limited effectiveness in repairing neural net-
works as demonstrated in [10]. Their heuristics (i.e., focusing on
neurons in the output layer) is not justified from our point of view
as the neurons causing the problematic behaviors may not be in
the output layer. In [3], an approach is proposed to repair a model
through inductive synthesis. Their approach has scalability issues
as a large model size leads to a large search space. While NNRe-
pair [65] provides a constraint-based approach to fix the logic of a
neural network at an intermediate layer or output layer, its fault
localization and repair applies to a single layer only but the actual
fault could be across multiple layers. Thus its repair performance
may not be ideal and we provide a comparison in Section 4.2.

In our approach, we propose to address the repair problem
through optimization, i.e., based on the Particle Swarm Optimi-
sation (PSO) algorithm. Besides PSO, there are many other opti-
mization algorithms. Genetic optimization algorithms (genetic algo-
rithm for example) usually do not handle complexity in an efficient
way [54] since the large number of elements undergoing mutation
causes a considerable increase in the search space. In comparison,
PSO requires smaller number of parameters and thus has lower
number of iterations. Another type of optimization is stochastic
optimization algorithm. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as
an representative uses a sampling technique for global optimiza-
tion. However, MCMC often encounter either slow convergence
or biased sampling [18]. Hence, in this work we select intelligence
based algorithm PSO.

The idea is to search for small adjustments in weight parame-
ters of the neurons identified in the previous step such that the
specified property is satisfied. PSO simulates intelligent collective
behavior of animals such as schools of fish and flocks of birds. It is
known to be particularly effective for optimization in continuous
domains [52]. In PSO, multiple particles are placed in the search
space. At each time step, each particle updates its location −→𝑥𝑖 and
velocity −→𝑣𝑖 according to an objective function. That is, the velocity is
updated based on the current velocity −→𝑣𝑖 , the previous best location
found locally −→𝑝𝑖 and the previous best location found globally −→𝑝𝑔.
Its location is updated based on the current location and velocity.
We write 𝑅(0, 𝑐) to denote a random number uniformly sampled

from the range of [0, 𝑐]. Formally, the PSO update equation is as
follows [55].

−→𝑣𝑖 ← 𝜔−→𝑣𝑖 + 𝑅(0, 𝑐1)(−→𝑝𝑖 − −→𝑥𝑖 ) + 𝑅(0, 𝑐2)(−→𝑝𝑔 − −→𝑥𝑖 )
−→𝑥𝑖 ← −→𝑥𝑖 + −→𝑣𝑖

(8)

(9)

where 𝜔, 𝑐1 and 𝑐2 represent inertia weight, cognitive parameter
and social parameter respectively. In PSO, the fitness function is
used to determine the best location.

In CARE, the weights of the identified neurons are the subject
for optimization and thus are represented by the location of the
particles in PSO. The initial location of each particle is set to their
original weight and the initial velocity is set to zero.

As defined in Section 2, our problem is to repair a given neural
network 𝑁 against property 𝜙 while minimizing the accuracy drop.
Therefore, two essential components need to be considered in the
optimization process: 1) model performance on property 𝜙 and
2) model accuracy. In CARE, we measure the model performance
based on the property 𝜙 specified. Formally, the fitness function of
PSO is defined as follows.

𝑓 𝑖𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 = (1 − 𝛼) 𝑈 𝐵 + 𝛼 (1 − 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦)

(10)

where UB (undesirable behavior) is a quantitative measure on the
degree of violating property 𝜙; constant parameter 𝛼 ∈ (0, 1)
determines the relative importance of the accuracy. For fairness
improvement task, we randomly sample a large set of instances
and 𝑈 𝐵 is measured by the percentage of individual discrimina-
tory instances within the set, i.e., let 𝑁 (𝑥) be the prediction of
𝑥 and (𝑥, 𝑥 ′) be a pair of discriminatory instances in the sample
set, 𝑈 𝐵 = 𝑃 (𝑁 (𝑥) ≠ 𝑁 (𝑥 ′)); for backdoor removal task, we add
backdoor trigger (if it is known) to all samples in testing set and
measure 𝑈 𝐵 = 𝑆𝑅(𝑡) following Definition 2.2; for safety task, we
randomly sample a large set of instances and measure 𝑈 𝐵 = 𝑉 𝑅(𝜌)
following Definition 2.4. Intuitively, our optimization target is to
make the repaired model satisfy given property 𝜙 while maintain-
ing the accuracy. Note that, for other properties, CARE is able to
conduct repair as long as a performance indicator is specified based
on the given property properly.

Example 3.3. In our running example, CARE applies PSO to gen-
erate a repair network 𝑀 that will improve the fairness performance
of 𝑁 . The weights of the identified 13 neurons in the previous step
are the subjects for the optimization. We set 𝛼 to 0.8 so that PSO can
optimize for fairness without sacrificing model accuracy too much.
PSO terminates at 17𝑡ℎ iteration where no better location is found in
the last 10 consecutive iterations. By adjusting neural weights accord-
ingly, 𝑀 is generated. CARE performs fairness and accuracy check on
𝑀 and the maximum probability difference is 0.007 with accuracy
of 0.86 (original accuracy is 0.88). Thus, CARE successfully repairs
𝑁 with a fairness improvement of 46.1% and the model accuracy is
mildly affected.

4 IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
In the following, we conduct a set of experiments to evaluate CARE.
We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different
tasks: 1) neural network fairness improvement, 2) neural network
backdoor removal and 3) neural network safety property violation

repair. All experiments are conducted on a machine with 1 Dual-
Core Intel Core i5 2.9GHz CPU and 8GB system memory. To reduce
the effect of randomness, all experimental results are the average
of five runs if randomness is involved.

4.1 Experiment Setup
In the following, CARE is evaluated over multiple datasets by
answering mutpile research questions (RQs). The details of the
datasets are summarized as follows:

For fairness repair, CARE is evaluated over three datasets that
are commonly used in machine learning model fairness testing [2,
21, 64, 72],

• Census Income [12]: This dataset consists of 32,561 train-
ing instances containing 13 features and is used to predict
whether an individual income exceeds $50K per year. Among
all attributes, gender, age and race are three protected char-
acteristics. The labels are if an individual income exceeds
$50K per year or not.

• German Credit [13]: This dataset consists of 1000 instances
with 20 features and is used to assess an individual’s credit.
Here, age and gender are the protected features. The labels
are whether a person’s credit is good or not.

• Bank Marketing [11]: This dataset consists of 45,211 instances
and there are 17 features. Among them, age is the protected
feature. The labels are whether the client will subscribe a
term deposit or not.

We train three feed-forward neural networks following standard
practice and run CARE to repair the unfair behavior of each model
against the corresponding protected features.

For backdoor removal, CARE is evaluated over three datasets:
• German Traffic Sign Benchmark Dataset (GTSRB) [60]: This
dataset consists of 39.2K training instances and 12.6K testing
instances of colored images. The task is to recognize 43
different traffic signs. We train a CNN network consists of 6
convolutional layers and 2 dense layers.

• MNIST [41]: This dataset consists of 70K instances of hand-
written digits as gray-scale images. We train a standard 4-
layer CNN network to recognize the 10 digits (0-9).

• Fashion-MNIST [69]: This data set consists of 70K instances
of 10 fashion categories, e.g., dress, coat and etc. Each sample
is a 28x28 grayscale image. We train a CNN network consists
of 3 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers.

For safety violation repairing, CARE is evaluated over three
ACAS Xu [33] networks. ACAS Xu contains an array of 45 DNNs
that produces horizontal maneuver advisories of unmanned version
of Airborne Collision Avoidance System X. As discovered in [34,
50], some DNNs violates certain safety properties, e.g., DNN 𝑁2,9
violates the safety property 𝜙 8. We apply CARE on 3 sub networks
𝑁2,9, 𝑁3,3 and 𝑁1,9 against 3 properties 𝜙8, 𝜙2 and 𝜙7 respectively,
aiming to repair the misbehavior. Table 1 shows the details of the
trained networks used in our experiment.

In PSO, we follow the general recommendation in [51] and set
parameter 𝜔 = 0.8, 𝑐1 = 𝑐2 = 0.41 and number of particles to 20.
The maximum number of iteration is set to 100. To further reduce
the searching time, we stop the search as soon as the property is
satisfied or we fail to find a better location in the last 10 consecutive

an 𝑀. If the accuracy drop is significant, i.e., bigger than a threshold
of 3%, CARE returns error message and a larger value of 𝛼 shall be
set in such scenarios.

4.2 Research Questions and Answers
In the following, we report our experiment results and answer mul-
tiple research questions.

RQ1: Is CARE successful in neural network repair? To answer this
question, we systematically apply CARE to the above-mentioned
neural networks.

For fairness repair tasks, to better evaluate the performance of
CARE, we set a strict fairness requirement (i.e., 𝜉 = 1%) to make
sure all models fail the fairness property and CARE performs fair-
ness repair on all of them (note that some of models fail fairness
even if 𝜉 is set to be a realistic value of 5%). Table 2 summarizes
the results, where the columns show model, the protected feature,
the unfairness (maximum probability difference) before and after
repair and model accuracy before and after repair. Note that in
this experiment, input features are assumed to be independent and
normal distribution is followed in our sampling process. The num-
ber of neurons to repair is set to be no more than 10% of total
number of neurons in the given network. As illustrated in Table 2,
among all cases, 𝑁 𝑁2 and 𝑁 𝑁3 show alarming fairness concern
(i.e., with unfairness above 5%). CARE successfully repairs all neu-
ral networks, with an average fairness improvement of 61.9% and
maximum of 99.2%. In terms of model accuracy, either the accuracy
is unchanged (𝑁 𝑁2) or has only a slight drop (𝑁 𝑁1 and 𝑁 𝑁3).

We further compare the performance of CARE with the state-of-
the-art work [61] for this task. The method proposed in [61], relies
on learning a Markov Chain from original network and performing
sensitivity analysis on it. Then optimization is applied to find small
adjustments to weight parameters of sensitive neurons for better
fairness. We run experiments on 𝑁 𝑁1, 𝑁 𝑁2 and 𝑁 𝑁3 and the
performance comparison is shown in Table 5 (DTMC represents
the method proposed in [61]). CARE is able to improve fairness by
61.9% on average and the model accuracy drops by 1.7%, while
DTMC only improves fairness by 45.1% at a higher cost of 2.2%.
For backdoor removal tasks, we train neural networks 𝑁 𝑁4,
𝑁 𝑁5 and 𝑁 𝑁6 following the attack methodology proposed in Bad-
Nets [26]. We randomly chose a target label for each network and

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Bing Sun, Jun Sun, Long H. Pham, and Jie Shi

vary the ratio of adversarial inputs in training to achieve a high
attack success rate of > 95% while maintaining high accuracy.
The trigger is a white square located at the bottom right of the
image with size 4 × 4 (around 1% of the entire image). In the ex-
periment, we assume the trigger is unknown (as it is often the
case in real application) and testing dataset is available. We adopt
the technique proposed in [67] to reverse engineer the trigger. As
discovered in [67], the reverse-engineered trigger is not perfect in
terms of visual similarity. However, CARE is able to remove the
backdoor effectively as shown below. Since 𝑁 𝑁4, 𝑁 𝑁5 and 𝑁 𝑁6
are CNNs and convolutional layers tend to extract local features
such as edges, textures, objects and scenes [70], we apply CARE
on dense layers only. We measure the attack success rate (SR) by
adding the reverse-engineered trigger to all images in the testing
set. As shown in Table 3, for all the three models, CARE is able to
mitigate the backdoor attack by reducing the attack SR from over
98% to less than 1%, while the accuracy of the repaired networks
either maintains the same (𝑁 𝑁4) , reduced by < 1% (𝑁 𝑁5) or even
improved (𝑁 𝑁6).

Furthermore, we compare CARE with the state-of-the-art neural
network repair technique proposed in [65] named NNRepair. NNRe-
pair leverages activation map [24] to perform fault localization of
a buggy neural network and fix undesirable behaviors using con-
straint solving. We conduct experiments over CARE and NNRepair
on two CNN models (experiment subjects of NNRepair) trained on
MNIST [41] and CIFAR10 [39] datasets. The average performance
comparison is shown in Figure 5. CARE is able to reduces the SR by
99.9% with accuracy drop of 1.5% on average. In contrast, NNRe-
pair only reduce SR by 19.3% and model accuracy drops by 5.9%.
For safety property repair tasks, we use 𝑁2,9, 𝑁3,3 and 𝑁1,9 of
1. These networks
ACAS Xu networks as our 𝑁 𝑁7, 𝑁 𝑁8 and 𝑁 𝑁9
take 5-dimentional inputs of sensor readings and output 5 possible
maneuver advises. Katz et al. [34] and Long et al. [50], demonstrate
that 𝑁2,9 violates the safety property 𝜙8, 𝑁3,3 violates property 𝜙2
and 𝑁1,9 violates property 𝜙7. Therefore, we apply CARE on these
3 networks to improve their performance on the corresponding
property. In this experiment, for each network, we randomly sample
10K counterexamples to the property as the evaluation set and 10K
instances that are correctly classified by the original neural network
as the drawdown set. We measure the violation rate (VR) on each set
to evaluate the performance. As shown in Table 4, for all the three
networks, CARE successfully brings down the violation rate from
1.0 to < 1% in evaluation set, while the performance in drawdown
set is not affected.

To further evaluate the performance of CARE on safety property
repair tasks, we compare CARE with the state-of-the-art approach
proposed in [59] named PRDNN. PRDNN [59] introduces decou-
pled neural network architecture and solves neural network repair
problem as a linear programming problem. We apply PRDNN on
the above mentioned three ACAS Xu networks. The average result
2 is shown in Table 5. Both tools are able
of 𝑁 𝑁7, 𝑁 𝑁8 and 𝑁 𝑁9
improve the performance effectively while CARE outer-performs

1A bug was found in the inital implementation for the sampling range of 𝑁 𝑁9 and all
the related results are updated accordingly after the fix
2PRDNN hangs with our initial experimental setup but we resolved this issue by setting
up another Ubuntu virtual machine with more disk size.

PRDNN by 2.2% although the cost is slightly higher (still below
1%)34.

Thus to answer RQ1, we say CARE is able to repair given buggy
neural network successfully for various properties while main-
taining high model accuracy. Furthermore, CARE outer-performs
existing works for different tasks.

RQ2: What is the effect of parameter 𝛼, i.e., the trade-off between the
degree of property violation and accuracy? Recall that the value of 𝛼
controls the trade-off between fairness and accuracy. To understand
the effect of 𝛼’s value, we perform another set of experiments.

Figure 5 illustrates the result on all neural networks, where the
first plot shows the performance improvement of repaired network
compared to original network and the second plot shows the cost
measured by model accuracy drop. As 𝛼 increases from 0.1 to 0.9,
the importance of model accuracy over repair objective in PSO fit-
ness function increases. As shown in the plots for 𝑁 𝑁1, the model
accuracy is quite sensitive with respect to the value of 𝛼, i.e., when
𝛼 = 0.2 model accuracy drops by 0.05 (from 0.88 to 0.83). Although
a smaller 𝛼 results in better fairness, we select a larger 𝛼 to keep
high model accuracy. As shown in the plots for 𝑁 𝑁2, model accu-
racy is stable over different 𝛼 values. Similar to the previous case,
smaller 𝛼 results in better fairness. Therefore, we select a small 𝛼
for more effective fairness repair. As for 𝑁 𝑁3, a large 𝛼 improves
model accuracy significantly. When 𝛼 is greater than 0.7, the model
accuracy is even higher than the original network. That is because
PSO tries to optimize for model accuracy as well. However, the
effectiveness of fairness improvement drops, i.e., model unfairness
is reduced to 0.001 for 𝛼 = 0.1 but at 𝛼 = 0.9 the unfairness is as
high as 0.0368. For 𝑁 𝑁4, 𝑁 𝑁5 and 𝑁 𝑁6 costs for all 𝛼 values are
small (< 1%). This is because fixing the backdoor itself will improve
model accuracy as well. For 𝑁 𝑁4 and 𝑁 𝑁5 the performance im-
provement (drop in SR) is quite stable over different 𝛼. For 𝑁 𝑁6, the
performance improvement drops as 𝛼 increases, hence, we select
small 𝛼 to let the optimization focus on backdoor removal. As for
𝑁 𝑁7, 𝑁 𝑁8 and 𝑁 𝑁9, the performance improvement is stable over
different 𝛼’s values. For 𝑁 𝑁7, the cost drops from 0.25% to 0.02%
when 𝛼 increases from 0.1 to > 0.2. While for 𝑁 𝑁8 and 𝑁 𝑁9, value
of 𝛼 does not affect the cost much. Hence, we select small 𝛼 value
for 𝑁 𝑁7 and 𝑁 𝑁8 and select 𝛼 > 0.1 for 𝑁 𝑁9. As shown by the
experiment results, the value of 𝛼 balances the trade-off between
performance improvement and cost. A smaller 𝛼 often results in
more effective property repair but model accuracy may be affected.
In our experiments, we set the value of 𝛼 as shown in Table 6.

Thus to answer RQ2, we say that 𝛼 does have a significant impact
on the repairing result. In practice, the users can decide its value
based on the importance of the property. In the future, we aim to
study systematic ways of identifying the best 𝛼 value automatically.

RQ3: How effective is the causality-based fault localization? This
question asks whether our causality-based fault localization is use-
ful. We answer this question by comparing the repair effectiveness
through optimizing the weight parameters that are selected in four
different ways, i.e., 1) selected based on our approach; 2) selected

3A bug was found in the initial code modifications to PRDNN for 𝑁 𝑁8 and 𝑁 𝑁9 and
the results are updated accordingly after the fix.
4We use the same validation set generated by CARE to evaluate both tools.

randomly; 3) selected based gradients and 4) include all the param-
eters. The results are shown in Table 7.

Firstly, we perform network repair with randomly selected neu-
rons to optimize. We follow the same configuration of CARE as the
one we used in RQ1, i.e., with the same 𝛼 value and the number of
neurons to fix. The performance improvement and cost of the repair
is shown in Random1 columns in Table 7. Adjusting randomly se-
lected parameters results in an average performance improvement
of 47.6%. While CARE improves the performance by 80.8% on all
tasks. For fairness repair tasks, the improvement is significant with
randomly selected neurons. However, the model accuracy drops
sharply. The overall accuracy drop is 8.9% on average with the
worst case of 19.0% for 𝑁 𝑁2 w.r.t. protected feature gender. For
backdoor removal tasks, the performance improvement is 6.4% on
average and model accuracy is affected. Especially for 𝑁 𝑁6, accu-
racy is reduced by 6.3% after the repair. In terms of safety repair

tasks, the repair is not so effective. For 𝑁 𝑁7 the performance im-
provement is less than 1% and in average the improvement is only
36.6%, although the model accuracy is not affected much. There-
fore, with randomly selected parameters, the repair is not effective
and the performance is improved at the cost of disrupting correct
behavior of the original model. On the other side, as described in
Section 3, our fault localization is based on the causal influence of
each neuron on the targeted misbehavior without altering other
behaviors.

Secondly, we optimize all weight parameters of the given neural
network, i.e., no fault localization. In this setting, the search space in
the PSO algorithm increases significantly (compared to the case of
repairing 10% of parameters in CARE). Therefore, we limit the time
taken by PSO so that time allowed to spend in this step is the same
as that taken by CARE with fault localization. The results are shown
in columns All. For fairness repair tasks the fairness is improved
by 67.8% on average. But the model accuracy drops significantly,
i.e., the accuracy drops by 20.1% on average and 42.0% in the
worst case. For backdoor removal, the performance improvement
is only 36.2% on average, while CARE reduces the SR by 99.5%.
For safety repair tasks, the performance improvement is 55.6% on

Table 7: Fault Localization Effectiveness

average and CARE manages to reduce the VR in evaluation set by
99.8%. Although the cost is below 1% for these two tasks, the repair
is not that effective. In all of the cases without fault localization,
PSO is not able to converge within the time limit and as a result,
neither performance improvement nor cost is optimized when PSO
terminates.

In the literature, gradient is a commonly used technique that
guides the search in program fault localization, program repair and
fairness testing [20, 57, 72]. Therefore, we conduct experiments
to compare the performance of CARE with gradient-guided fault
localization. That is, instead of calculating causal attribution of the
hidden neurons, the fault localization step is based on 𝜕𝑦
𝜕𝑣 where
𝑦 represents the favourable output value and 𝑣 represents hidden
neuron value. We use the gradient-based method to identify the
same amount of “responsible" neurons and perform optimization
with the same setting as CARE. The results of gradient-based lo-
calization method is illustrated in columns Gradient of Table 7.
Compared with CARE, for fairness repair tasks, the gradient-based
method is able to find a repair that satisfies fairness criteria but fails
to maintain model accuracy. Overall fairness improves by 73.6%
but average accuracy drops by 17.8%, which is not desirable. For
backdoor removal, the gradient-based method is not able to find
an effective repair where the overall performance improvement is
below 30%. Especially for 𝑁 𝑁4, the SR is still as high as 96.4%
after the repair. For safety repair, gradient-based method is able to
find a repair for 𝑁 𝑁8 and 𝑁 𝑁9 with performance improvement
above 90%, while CARE archives 100% backdoor removal. For
𝑁 𝑁7, gradient-based method is not useful at all where VR in evalu-
ation set is as high as 99% after the repair. Hence the performance
of gradient-based method is not stable and often not effective.

Thus to answer RQ3, we say our causality-based fault localization
is effective in identifying candidates for parameter optimization. It
guides CARE to focus on fixing undesirable behavior of the model
while keeping the correct behavior unaffected.

5 RELATED WORK
This work is broadly related to works on neural network verifica-
tion, repair and causal interpretation.

Neural network verification. There have been an impressive line of
methods proposed recently for neural network verification. These
includes solving the problem using abstraction techniques [16, 22,
56], SMT sovler [30, 34, 35], MILP and LP [15, 62], symbolic exe-
cution [68] and many others [7, 14, 25, 37]. There have also been
attempts to verify neural network fairness properties, including [4]
and [5] based on numerical integration , [31] based on non-convex
optimization and [61] based on probabilistic model checking. Unlike
these works, our approach focus on neural network repair instead
and we leverage some existing verification methods [59, 61, 67] in
our work for property verification.

Machine learning model repair. There have been multiple attempts
on repairing machine learning models to remove undesirable be-
haviors. In [36], Kauschke et al. suggest a method to learn a model
to determine error regions of the given model, which allows users
to patch the given model. In [58], Sotoudeh et al. propose a method
to correct a neural network by applying small changes to model
weights based on SMT formulation of the problem. In [23], Gold-
berger et al. leverage recent advances in neural network verifica-
tion and presented an approach to repair a network with minimal
change in its weights. This approach aims to find minimal layer-
wise fixes for a given point-wise specification and the performance
is restricted by the underlying verification method used. NNRe-
pair [65] performs constraint-based repair on neural networks to
fix undesirable behaviors but only applies to a single layer. So-
toudeh et al. proposed a method in [59] to solve a neural network
repair problem as a linear programming problem. Unlike our ap-
proach, both NNrepair and the method proposed in [59] perform
layer-wise repair but the actual fault in a buggy network could
be across multiple layers. Furthermore, based on our experiment
results, our approach is more effective in neural network repair
against different properties.

Causality-Based Neural Network Repair

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

Machine learning causal interpretation. Causality analysis has been
applied to generate explanations for machine learning algorithms.
Existing works focus on causal interpretable models that can explain
why machine learning models make certain decision. Narendra et
al. [46] model DNNs as SCMs and estimate the causal effect of each
component of the model on the output. In [8], Chattophadhyay et al.
proposed an scalable causal approach to estimate individual causal
effect of each feature on the model output. Causal inference has
been applied in machine learning model fairness studies. Kusner et
al. [40] proposed an approach to measure the fairness of a machine
learning model based on counterfactuals where a fair model should
have the same prediction for both actual sample and counterfactual
sample. In [71], Zhang et al. propose a causal explanation based
metric to quantitatively measure the fairness of an algorithm. Our
work utilizes SCMs and 𝑑𝑜 (·) calculus to measure the causal at-
tribution of hidden neurons on model undesirable behaviors. The
results are used as a guideline for fault localization.

6 CONCLUSION
We present CARE, a causality-based technique for repairing neural
networks for various properties. CARE performs fault localiza-
tion on a given neural network model and utilizes PSO to adjust
the weight parameters of the identified neurons. CARE generates
repaired networks with improved performance over specified prop-
erty while maintaining the model’s accuracy. CARE is evaluated
empirically with multiple neural networks trained on benchmark
datasets and experiment results show that CARE is able to repair
buggy model efficiently and effectively, with minimally disruption
on existing correct behavior.

7 DATA AVAILABILITY
