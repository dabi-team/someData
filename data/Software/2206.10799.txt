ABSTRACT

Context. When studying the production and escape of Lyman Continuum from galaxies, it is standard to rely on array of indirect
observational tracers in preselection of candidate leakers.
Aims. In this work, we investigate how much ionizing radiation might be missed due to these selection criteria by completely removing
them and performing a search selected purely from rest-frame LyC emission; and how that aﬀects our estimates of the ionizing
background.
Methods. We invert the conventional method and perform a bottom-up search for Lyman-continuum leaking galaxies at redshifts
2 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 3.5. Using archival data from HST and VLT/MUSE, we run source ﬁnding software on UV-ﬁlter HST images from the
HUDF, and subject all detected sources to a series of tests to eliminate those that are inconsistent with being ionizing sources.
Results. We ﬁnd 6 new and one previously identiﬁed candidate leakers with absolute escape fractions ranging from 36% to ∼ 100%.
Our ﬁltering criteria eliminate one object previously reported as a candidate ionizing emitter in the literature, while we report non-
detection in the rest frame Lyman continuum of two other previously reported sources. We ﬁnd that our candidates make a contribution
to the metagalactic ionizing ﬁeld of log10((cid:15)ν) = 25.32+0.25
−0.22 erg s−1 Hz−1 cMpc−3 for the full set of candidates and for the
4 strongest candidates only; both values are higher than but consistent with other recent ﬁgures in the literature.
Conclusions. Our ﬁndings suggest that galaxies that do not meet the usual selection criteria may make a non-negligible contribution
to the cosmic ionizing ﬁeld. We recommend that similar searches be carried out on a larger scale in well-studied ﬁelds with both UV
and large ancillary data coverage, for example in the full set of CANDELS ﬁelds.

1. Introduction

The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) was the last major phase tran-
sition of the Universe, and ended around z ∼ 5.5 - 6 (e.g., Fan
et al. 2006; Dayal et al. 2020; Bosman et al. 2022). At the rele-
vant redshifts, the Cosmic AGN population was probably still
too low to dominate the metagalactic ionizing radiation (e.g.,
Haardt & Madau 2012; Faucher-Giguère 2020; Madau & Haardt
2015). Young, hot stars in star forming galaxies thus most likely
contributed the bulk of ionizing photons. Balancing the budget
of ionizing photons required to account for reionization is still
an ongoing topic of research. The amount of ionizing photons
required to account for reionization is still debated (e.g., Davies
et al. 2021), as is the time scale and thus the required photon
production rate (e.g., Naidu et al. 2020; Becker et al. 2021, and
references therein). In order to account for the EoR, an estimated
fraction of the produced ionized photons f LyC
esc ≈ 10 – 20 % must
escape their source galaxies Robertson et al. (2015); Finkelstein
et al. (2019); Naidu et al. (2020), yet in the low- and intermediate
redshift Universe, neither the number of LyC-emitting galaxies
nor their average escape fractions meet this requirement. In the
local Universe, Lyman Continuum Emitters (LCEs) seem to be
exceedingly rare, with just over 50 conﬁrmed leakers known at
z < 0.5 (Bergvall et al. 2006; Leitet et al. 2011, 2013; Borthakur
et al. 2014; Leitherer et al. 2016; Izotov et al. 2016b,a, 2018a,b;
Wang et al. 2019; Malkan & Malkan 2021; Flury et al. 2022).
Earlier studies ﬁnd escape fractions of only a few percent, but
later searches focusing on extreme emission line galaxies have

(cid:63) e-mail: trive@astro.su.se

yielded a much wider range of line-of-sight escape fractions
(Izotov et al. 2016b,a, 2018a,b). At “cosmic noon”, 2 ≤ z ≤ 4,
a roughly similar number of conﬁrmed leakers have been found
(Vanzella et al. 2012; Mostardi et al. 2015; Shapley et al. 2016;
de Barros et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016; Bian et al. 2017;
Fletcher et al. 2019; Chisholm et al. 2018; Steidel et al. 2018;
Vanzella et al. 2018; Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2019; Ji et al. 2020;
Marques-Chaves et al. 2021), as well as a number of candidates
still awaiting follow-up and conﬁrmation. Only one conﬁrmed
leaker has been found in the diﬃcult window of 1 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 2,
using the Astrosat space observatory (Saha et al. 2020). In ad-
dition, stacking analyses at redshifts 1 ≤ z ≤ 3 have shown the
overall cosmic escape fraction to be low at redshifts < 3. Cowie
et al. (2009) found a 2-σ upper limit to the average escape frac-
tion of < 0.8% at 0.9 < z < 1.4 using stacked GALEX imaging,
concluding that galaxies can only have accounted for reioniza-
tion if the average escape fraction evolves strongly between red-
shifts 1.4 and 5. For a similar redshift range, Alavi et al. (2020)
found a 3-σ limit of the average escape fraction at z ∼ 1.3 of
< 7%, although this was for a relatively small sample, selected
speciﬁcally to be young, highly star forming, low-mass and low-
metallicity; and Rutkowski et al. (2016) found an upper limit to
the escape fraction of star forming galaxies at z ∼ 1 to be fesc <
2.1%, and of fesc < 9.6% for a subsample selected to have WHα
200 Å, which are believed to be the closest intermediate redshift
analogs to star-forming galaxies at redshifts z ≥ 6.

At higher redshifts, Grazian et al. (2016, 2017) ﬁnd from a
stacking analysis in the GOODS-N, EGS and COSMOS ﬁelds
an average fesc (cid:46) 2% for bright galaxies and (cid:46) 10% for faint

galaxies at z = 3.3. They conclude that the ionizing output in
their search volume is too low by a factor of 2 to account for the
ionized state of the Universe at that redshift and insuﬃcient to
account for the epoch of reionization without a signiﬁcant evo-
lution in average escape fraction.

The exact mass, luminosity and number distribution of Ly-
man Continuum (LyC) leaking galaxies cannot be studied di-
rectly at redshifts (cid:38) 4, at which point the neutral fraction of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes high enough to eﬀectively
make it opaque to ionizing radiation (Inoue et al. 2014). To study
the processes which govern LyC escape, and in turn the process
of Reionization, we need reliable tracers of escaping LyC, and
reliable estimators of intrinsic LyC. The production rate is read-
ily determined from observable quantities; but the escape de-
pends on a complex interplay of ISM conditions including star,
gas and dust content, ISM geometry, kinematics and ionization
parameter and metallicity.

A popular candidate tracer is the ratio of doubly to singly
ionized Oxygen, as measured in the forbidden optical lines,
[O iii]/[O ii] or O32 (Jaskot & Oey 2013; Nakajima & Ouchi
2014; Keenan et al. 2017). The strength of the [O iii] λλ
4960,5008 Å doublet reﬂects the ionizing output of the stars in
the region, and the relative strengths of the [O iii] and [O ii] traces
the relative amounts of doubly and singly ionized oxygen and
thus indirectly the ionization properties of the ISM surrounding
the LyC producing stellar region. The ratio is easily observed but
as a predictor of fesc,LyC it has shown mixed results (Jaskot et al.
2019; Bassett et al. 2019; Nakajima et al. 2020). Still, it remains
a widely used tool for candidate preselection.

In addition to serving as tracers of ionizing emissivity during
the EoR and subsequent epoch when LyC cannot be observed
directly, these observables also provide eﬃcient and convenient
preselection criteria when carrying out searches for LyC leakers
in a given cosmic volume; and indeed every search listed above
rely on either in the literature at the time of writing this has re-
lied of one or more of these preselection criteria. Each of these
criteria however has some associated selection bias. The equiv-
alent width of Hα, which traces strong speciﬁc star formation,
was a applied as the main selection criterion by e.g. Rutkowski
et al. (2016). O32 is a tracer of compound eﬀects of star for-
mation and ISM ionization and has been widely applied as a
preselection criterion, among others by Rutkowski et al. (2017);
Flury et al. (2022); Izotov et al. (2016b,a, 2018a,b). Photomet-
ric rest-frame UV colors (Flury et al. 2022), including Lyman
Break selection (Steidel et al. 2018), is cheap and eﬀective but
only traces observed UV photon production, and LBG selection
criteria directly exclude galaxies with large fesc,LyC (Cooke et al.
2014).

Rutkowski et al. (2017) performed a stacking analysis of
emission line selected galaxies at z ∼ 2.5, and found that the
escape fraction for [O ii] selected galaxies was (cid:46) 5.6%, and
(cid:46) 14.0% for galaxies selected for [O iii]/[O ii] ≥ 5, not enough
to cause and maintain ionization of the IGM unless the number
of these extreme emission line galaxies grows substantially be-
tween redshifts 2 and 6.

Lyman-α line properties is another widely used preselection
criterion (e.g. Fletcher et al. 2019; Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2019).
Lyα radiative transfer is regulated by and highly sensitive to the
same H i which also absorbs LyC, although the eﬀects are dif-
ferent and the comparison thus not straightforward (Verhamme
et al. 2015; Behrens et al. 2014; Kakiichi & Gronke 2021).
Strong Lyα emission with a narrow, double-peaked line proﬁle
with narrow peak separation has proven a reliable, of not neces-
sarily complete, predictor of LyC emission (Izotov et al. 2018a;

Article number, page 2 of 22

Kakiichi & Gronke 2021; Flury et al. 2022). It however is un-
clear how much of Cosmic LyC is traced by Lyα. The majority
of ionizing photons in the Universe at z ∼ 3 are produced in Ly-
man Break galaxies or local analogs, but only ∼ 20% of LBGs
emit strongly in Lyα (Shapley et al. 2003; Stark et al. 2010).
The average Lyα escape fraction of z ∼ 3 LBGs is 5-10%, but
quickly increasing towards higher redshifts (Hayes et al. 2011).
It is possible that LyC escape may occur from galaxies with faint
or undetectable Lyα emission.

In this work, we mitigate the potential biases introduced
by such preselection by carrying out a search for any UV
source we could ﬁnd in archival data of the Hubble Ultra Deep
Field (HUDF, Beckwith et al. 2006); and for each detected UV
source using ancillary data to determine whether it is likely to
be a LyC-leaking galaxy within the redshift range appropriate
for the detection ﬁlter. In essence, one could say that this is
a Lyman-continuum selected survey and should capture every
LyC-leaking source in the ﬁeld, regardless of other properties.
Of course, the overwhelming majority of sources detected in
these ﬁlters is expected to be non-ionizing radiation from lower-
redshift galaxies, but current datasets have reached a point where
the completeness of spectroscopic catalogs delivered by large-
format IFUs is suﬃcient to provide redshifts for the great major-
ity of these sources.

We perform the source detection in archival Hubble
WFC3/UVIS UV imaging of the HUDF (The UVUDF, Teplitz
et al. 2013; Rafelski et al. 2015, hereafter R15), and for each
source, extract ﬂuxes in a small image segment at its location on
the sky in the other UVUDF ﬁlters, as well as the original opti-
cal HUDF ACS ﬁlters, and the WFC3/IR ﬁlters of Oesch et al.
(2010); Bouwens et al. (2011); Ellis et al. (2013). Furthermore,
we rely on the extensive spectroscopic redshift catalog for this
ﬁeld provided by Inami et al. (2017, hereafter I17) as part of the
larger MUSE-Deep survey (Bacon et al. 2015) to determine the
redshift of our sources, where a catalog entry exists.

Recently, two projects have surveyed larger ﬁelds containing
the HUDF in redshift ranges overlapping with this work (Jones
et al. 2021; Saxena et al. 2022); both relying on preselection
steps to identify candidates for deeper investigation. This pro-
vides an excellent opportunity for direct comparison with these
methods and a deeper discussion of their biases, advantages and
drawbacks.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we
brieﬂy describe the data on which this work builds. In Sect. 3,
we describe our methodology, the various steps in our process
of selecting candidate objects, and present the ﬁnal selection.
In Sect. 4, we present a physical characterization of the candi-
date galaxies, and we discuss the methods and results in Sect. 5.
Finally, we give a summary of our ﬁndings in Sect. 6. Through-
out this paper, we assume a standard concordance ﬂat Λ-CDM
cosmology with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, ΩΛ=0.7, and Ωm=0.3. Mag-
nitudes are given in the AB system.

2. Data

The purpose of this study is to test how much escaping ioniz-
ing radiation, if any, is not accounted for by the most common
preselection methods. Instead, we have performed an unbiased
source detection based on UV imaging data from the HST, se-
lecting interesting and candidate objects through a series of tests
and visual inspections as described below.

Imaging data used in this paper are the same as those pre-
sented in Teplitz et al. (2013) and Rafelski et al. (2015) (R15
in the following), and extensive information about observations

T. E. Rivera-Thorsen et al.: Lyman Continuum escape in the UVUDF

and reductions can be found in these two papers. Here we present
only a brief summary. We adopt the full wavelength range of
HST imaging for the UDF: The F225W, F275W, and F336W
data obtained from WFC3/UVIS under the UVUDF program,
the F435W, F606W, F775W, and F850LP imaging obtained with
ACS/WFC under the original HUDF campaign (Beckwith et al.
2006), and the F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W frames ob-
tained with WFC3/IR under both the UDF09 and UDF12 cam-
paigns (Oesch et al. 2010; Bouwens et al. 2011; Ellis et al. 2013;
Koekemoer et al. 2013). We note that the UVIS imaging obtained
here falls within the footprint of the ACS optical imaging, but
only ≈ 80 % of the survey area is covered by the IR imaging. IR
data can greatly help determine the redshifts and physical prop-
erties of the stellar population, but where none was present, we
have still included objects with UV and optical colors suggesting
them to be possible LyC leakers.

Using an array of diﬀerent ﬁlters, the relative photometry
will be aﬀected by the relative point-spread function at each
wavelength of each camera. All PSFs were created by stacking
stars, while for both WFC3 UVIS and IR data the PSFs were
supplemented by models PSFs that describe the outer wings; see
R15 for more details. Matching and convolution were then per-
formed using the psfmatch and fconvolve tasks in IRAF. In
addition, we have extracted spectra from MUSE datacubes from
the oﬃcial data products released by the MUSE-DEEP (Bacon
et al. 2015), made available from the ESO archives.1

3. Analysis and results

3.1. Strategy overview

Here, we give a quick overview of the search strategy; each
step will be described in greater depth below. In a nutshell, our
strategy can be formulated as: Detect every source present in a
given UV ﬁlter, and subsequently use images in additional, red-
der, ﬁlters as well as ancillary information to determine for each
source whether it is consistent with being escaping LyC radia-
tion in the detection ﬁlter. To this end, we ﬁrst ran source ﬁnd-
ing and detection routines on each of the three background sub-
tracted (Sect. 3.2) UV ﬁlter images using a set of settings which
ensure that we catch as many faint but real sources at the cost of
yielding a potentially substantial number of spurious detections
(Sect. 3.3).

Using the segmentation maps created in the source detection
step, we extracted ﬂuxes for each segment in each of the eleven
ﬁlters (or the available subset hereof, Sect. 3.4). For each ﬁlter,
the adjacent ﬁlter to the red side was used as a veriﬁcation ﬁlter;
any detection that was not also detected in the veriﬁcation ﬁlter
was immediately rejected (Sect. 3.5.1). Since we are searching
for objects at a redshift which puts LyC in the detection ﬁlter
and nonionizing UV continuum in the veriﬁcation ﬁlter, we also
required that an object must be of lower mAB in the veriﬁca-
tion ﬁlter than the detection ﬁlter (Sect. 3.5.2). Figure 2 shows
throughput curves of the three UV ﬁlters and, for each of them,
its pivot wavelength and the redshift at which the Lyman edge
of 912 Å falls approximately at its red edge. Also shown is the
optical ﬁlter F435W, used for veriﬁcation of sources detected in
F336W (see below).

cubes superimposed on the UVUDF FOV, represented by the

ual MUSE pointings and mosaics.

Fig. 2: Filter throughput curves for the three detection ﬁlter plus

lower redshift cut-oﬀ for galaxies to be reliably detected in LyC.
Veriﬁcation of detections in any ﬁlter is done in the ﬁlter imme-
diately to the right.

Fig. 1 shows the footprints of the publicly available MUSE-
DEEP datacubes overlaid on the PSF-matched and background
subtracted UVUDF F225W image. The overlap is large but not
complete, and we did ﬁnd a few candidates in the UVUDF
falling outside the MUSE-DEEP footprint.

We then moved on to visual inspection of the remaining seg-
ments for morphology and for their SED, to remove objects
which are clearly not LyC leaking galaxies at redshift 1.9–3.5
(Sect. 3.5.3). Next, we matched the remaining objects to the
catalogs of R15 and I17 for existing photometric or spectro-
scopic redshifts. We also performed our own SED ﬁtting us-
ing BAGPIPES (Carnall et al. 2018), and extracted spectra from
the MUSE-DEEP public datacubes for selected objects. Where
present and of medium or high certainty (see Sect. 3.5.4), spec-

troscopic redshifts were given priority. Where only photometric
redshifts were present, we made a case-by-case assessment. Our
ﬁnal list of 7 candidate objects is tabulated in Table 1, which
lists their sky coordinates as well as the catalog IDs of the corre-
sponding objects in the catalogs of R15 and I17.

We ﬁnally re-measured ﬂuxes for the remaining candidates
in all available ﬁlters integrated in a circular aperture with a ﬁxed
diameter of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 8 (Sect. 4.1). This aperture size is equal to the
value of the seeing adopted in I17, and we found that it encom-
passes the majority of ﬂux from our remaining candidates, unlike
the often small image segments found from source detection in
the rest-frame FUV. These ﬂuxes enabled us to ﬁnd integrated
stellar population properties which in turn allows for a more di-
rect comparison to other galaxies in the literature.

separation from the source.

3.2. Background subtraction

We modeled and subtracted the backgrounds of all drizzled
and PSF matched images using the python photutils pack-
age (Bradley et al. 2020), using the Background2D class, which
estimates the background locally on a mesh, based on sigma
clipping statistics, and subsequently interpolates this back-
ground mesh to the resolution of the original image. We used
the default SExtractorBackground background estimator and
StdBackgroundRMS background RMS estimator.

Following the recommendations from the photutils au-
thors, we estimated the background in two steps. In the ﬁrst step,
the background was estimated and subtracted on the unmasked
images. We then ran the make_source_mask function, which
uses sigma clipping statistics for an initial noise and background
estimate, then uses this to detect sources, create a segmentation
map, dilate the source segments, and ﬁnally output a mask ar-
ray. This mask was then passed to a second iteration with the
Background2D class, along with the unmodiﬁed data frames,
and the resulting background image subtracted from the latter.

The UV frames contain quite complex and strong features,
what the authors of R15 describe as a “blotchy pattern” which,
given the relatively weak signals and strongly correlated noise
patterns, could lead to over- or underestimation of ﬂux in certain
regions, in turn bringing detected ﬂux below the signal-to-noise

threshold or even below zero, if not properly modeled and sub-
tracted. It was therefore necessary to choose a box_size small
enough to encompass the characteristic size of these blotches, in
order to model these residual patterns, yet large enough to not
include noise in the model.

In the optical/red and IR ﬁlters, extended red stellar popula-
tions become visible in the ﬁeld’s elliptical galaxies. These pose
a challenge for background subtraction, as they require either
large box sizes or strong mask dilation in order to avoid sub-
tracting the outer stellar halos. We opted for a combination of
the two, although with the main emphasis on larger box size,
since the background in the optical and red ﬁlters has less struc-
ture than in the UV, and since there are so many objects visible
in the red and IR ﬁlters that dilating the masks would unneces-
sarily remove a large fraction of the background pixels, severely
impacting the quality of background modeling. We note that due
to the fact that we target relatively high surface brightness and
compact sources, this will make only a small diﬀerence to the
ﬁnal photometry in the redder bands.

In Appendix A, we show examples of background and back-
ground subtracted data in F225W and F775W to illustrate the
diﬀerent challenges presented by the UV and red data. Param-
eters passed to the source mask creation and background mod-
eling routines for each ﬁlter were determined by trial and error,
visually inspecting the modeled background for over- or under-
subtracted regions near masked sources, and artifacts of poorly
modeled background. The parameters that we ﬁnally settled on
are tabulated in Table A.1.

3.3. Source detection and deblending

ran the photutils source detection routines
We ﬁrst
detect_sources() with settings which prioritized complete-
ness in detection over avoiding spurious detections, since
these as discussed below will be rejected in later steps. We
then passed the resulting segmentation maps to the function
deblend_sources() to deblend overlapping galaxies. In the
latter step, we again allowed the algorithms to deblend too many
rather than too few sources, since LyC escape is a local phe-
nomenon which will not suﬀer any missed detections due to this,
while larger apertures, as discussed in Sect. 4.1, may dilute the
SNR of a detected source below our threshold value. This re-
sulted in a deblended segmentation map for each of the three
UV ﬁlters. For each of these, we then extracted ﬂuxes in all seg-
ments in every one of the remaining ﬁlters, including the two
remaining UV ﬁlters. Based on SNR and color selection criteria
described below, we could then reject objects that are inconsis-
tent with being Lyman Continuum leakers detected in the ioniz-
ing continuum.

Working on PSF-matched data comes at a cost in terms of
image depth, since the UV and optical data are convolved and
mixed with a number of pixels which contribute only noise, de-
grading the signal-to-noise ratios of ﬂuxes measured in these im-
ages. Rafelski et al. have opted to optimize their photometric
depth by measuring all ﬂuxes in unconvolved data, and subse-
quently applying an aperture loss correction in the NIR data,
where the PSF is signiﬁcantly larger than in the UV/optical
bands. However, such an approach would result in practical dif-
ﬁculties in this work, rendering it unfeasible. Most importantly,
such an aperture correction accounts for ﬂux lost outside aper-
ture due to convolution with the PSF, but not for ﬂux from out-
side sources bleeding into the aperture. When using the NUV
bands for detection images, a given segment used for photome-
try may only cover a small part of a galaxy and in general not

the part that is brightest in the optical and NIR bands, and thus
ﬂux from neighboring regions may bleed into the segment in
bands with larger PSF. Thus, when performing photometry on
segments of galaxies, this must be done on PSF matched images.

3.4. Photometry and uncertainties

For each or the three UVUDF ﬁlters, we created a segmentation
image as described above, and proceeded to measure ﬂuxes in
all segments of this image for every one of the ﬁlters listed in
Table A.1, resulting in a measured ﬂux in 11 ﬁlters for each seg-
ment in each of the three detection images. We re-estimated the
errors on the measured ﬂuxes by random sampling of the sur-
rounding background. Because of drizzling and PSF matching,
the noise is correlated, so a simple pixel-to-pixel variance esti-
mate is not suﬃcient. Instead, for each of the labeled segments,
we extracted the ﬂux in 200 apertures randomly placed within
a square region ± 300 pixels surrounding the segment. For sim-
plicity, we created circular apertures each of the same pixel area
as the segment. From these 200 segments, we computed the stan-
dard deviation of the computed ﬂuxes and adopted this value as
the error on the originally measured ﬂux. We performed this pro-
cedure for the three UV ﬁlters F225W, F275W, and F336W only.
The general S/N is much lower in the optical and IR ﬁlters, and
the ﬁeld gets crowded there, making the random aperture place-
ment impractical.

3.5. Sorting and selection

3.5.1. By Signal-to-noise

The detection and deblending procedures described above
yielded 2187, 2520, and 1804 segments in F225W, F275W, and
F336W. One would probably expect more detected objects for
longer wavelength ﬁlters, but we deliberately set the detection
and segmentation limits to allow for spurious detections, of
which we expect to ﬁnd more in the bluer ﬁlters where noise
levels are higher and throughput lower.

While random ﬂuctuations can align to yield spurious detec-
tions, the probability of this happening within the same small
area of a few tens of pixels in adjacent ﬁlters is small, and such
a chance alignment would be caught when examining the full

SED. Therefore, our ﬁrst selection criterion was that a detection
in any given segment be > 2σ in both the detection ﬁlter and in
its red-adjacent ﬁlter, such that detections in F225W must be ≥
2σ also in F275W, detections in F275W must be ≥ 2σ also in
F336W, and detections in F336W must be ≥ 2σ also in F435W.
The dual-band SNR ﬁltering left 1084, 1183, and 1261 segments
in F225W, F275W, and F336W, respectively.

3.5.2. By UV colors

As a next step, we have applied as a ﬁltering criterion that the
measured magnitude in the detection ﬁlter be larger (fainter) than
in the adjacent ﬁlter to the red side. Typical star forming galaxies
have a UV fλ spectrum deﬁned as a power law with an exponent,
the UV slope, of β ∼ −2. This corresponds to a ﬂat spectrum in
fν units and a ﬂat SED in AB magnitudes. Both dust and ISM
attenuation will aﬀect the bluer ﬁlter more strongly than the red-
der one, and thus, the observed ratio of ionizing-to-nonionizing
ﬂux will be a measure of the escape fraction fesc,LyC. No stellar
population modeling we know of does predict any populations
which intrinsically have higher fν ﬂuxes at restframe ∼ 800 Å
than at restframe ∼ 1000 Å, as the ﬁlters will approximately
probe. Even in case they exist, wavelength dependent attenua-
tion by dust will suppress F800 more strongly than F1100. The
only empirically based dust attenuation law that covers the ex-
treme UV wavelength domain (Reddy et al. 2016) is particularly
steep in this range and thus, even the modest diﬀerence in rest-
frame wavelength can mean a signiﬁcantly stronger attenuation
at λrest=800 Å than at λrest=1000 Å. In addition, LyC is absorbed
when interacting with the neutral ISM, which will suppress the
F900/F1500 ratio further. LCEs have been observed with relative
(i.e., not accounting for dust attenuation) escape fractions from
almost zero (Leitet et al. 2011, 2013; Puschnig et al. 2017) to
close to 100% (Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2019). This further sup-
presses F900/F1500 for a given galaxy.

Finally, at redshifts z (cid:38) 2, absorption by the neutral fraction
of the Intergalactic Medium becomes signiﬁcant. The average
IGM attenuation due to ionization of rest-frame λ ∼ 880 Å pho-
tons emitted at redshifts 2 (3) has been modeled by Inoue et al.
(2014) to be 0.3 (0.8) magnitudes, corresponding to an average
transmission factor of ∼0.76 (∼0.48). These numbers are how-

ever subject to a large scatter, see e.g. Vasei et al. (2016) for an
example distribution at z = 2.4.

With these combined attenuation eﬀects on ionizing photons
emitted within 2 ≤ z ≤ 3.5 in mind, we require our sources to
be fainter in the detection ﬁlter than in its red-adjacent ﬁlter in
order to be a believable LyC source. Applying this criterion left
385 segments in F225W, 598 objects in F275W, and 861 objects
in F336W. It is interesting to note that while we detected fewer
objects in F336W than the two other ﬁlters, more objects are left
in this ﬁlter after the SNR and color criteria have been applied.

3.5.3. By Morphology/Visual inspection

After these initial ﬁltering steps, we produced an SED plot as
well as a series of “postage stamp” images of all remaining ob-
jects. By visual inspection, we removed all segments that were
clearly fragments of larger nearby galaxies, as well as a num-
ber of edge cased which were diﬃcult to automate. In some
cases, a candidate had two nearby matches in the I17 catalog
of strongly diﬀering redshifts, and a visual inspection was the
best way to determine whether our candidate was associated to
one or the other, or the two were too strongly blended to tell
apart. Among the galaxies without matches in the I17 catalog,
some met the color selection criteria above but the combination
of their brightness, morphology and very red SED led us to re-
ject them as nearby interlopers. In other cases, faint detections
in the UV which passed the selection criteria, showed so strong
blue colors that they were undetected in the optical and IR ﬁlters

and thus not suitable for further investigation. A few spurious
detections had made it this far as well but was easily identiﬁed
from inspecting their SED and images.

3.5.4. By spectroscopic redshifts

Spectroscopy, where available, is the most reliable way of mea-
suring redshifts. Inami et al. (2017) published a catalog of 1574
spectroscopic redshifts in the HUDF, of which 1338 are reported
as high quality redshifts. We matched our candidate objects with
the I17 catalog by searching for sources within a radius of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 75,
slightly above the reported FWHM seeing in Inami et al. (2017),
beyond which contamination from nearby compact sources is
weak, and listed for each of our sources all MUSE sources within
this radius. In order to check for contamination and look for
sources not found in the catalog, we retrieved the publicly avail-
able MUSE-DEEP science cubes. For each galaxy in the sample
remaining from the ﬁltering process in sect. 3.5, we extracted a
spectrum from the muse cubes in the following way:

For each object, we determined whether it was contained in
the footprint of each of the MUSE-DEEP cubes. For objects con-
tained in a given cube, we extracted all pixels inside a circular
mask of radius 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 75 and, for each velocity slice, summed up
the ﬂux inside this aperture. Objects found inside the footprints
of multiple cubes were median-stacked. We then inspected the
spectra for line emission; if multiple lines were present, their
wavelength separation reveals which lines we were looking at.
If only one line was present, we preliminarily assumed it to be

Note that errors in the UV bands are inﬂated for the reasons de-
scribed in 3.4 and 4.1. Some datapoints here are shown as such

Lyα. Spectroscopic redshifts found by this procedure are, where
available, tabulated for objects of interest in Table 2.

Since our extraction was less sophisticated than that of In-
ami et al., the resulting spectra are not of the same quality as in
I17. Indeed, in a number of cases, where those authors’ redshift
determination depends on absorption features, we did not have
suﬃcient SNR to discern individual absorption features. In such
cases, we have listed the reported values and compared them
to available photometric redshifts and, where not consistently
contradicted by these, we have adopted the redshifts of MUSE-
DEEP for the given object.

3.5.5. By photometric redshifts

Included in the catalog of Rafelski et al. (2015) are photomet-
ric redshifts computed in two diﬀerent ways, the Bayesian pho-
tometric redshift (BPZ, Benítez 2000; Benítez et al. 2004; Coe
et al. 2006), and the redshift as computed by the software pack-
age EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008). In addition, in this work, we
computed photometric redshifts for the subset of our detected

candidate objects with Lyα in emission. At the bottom is shown
the observed wavelength scale, above each panel is the corre-
sponding rest-frame wavelength range.

objects that made it through the elimination process in section
3.5, using the stellar population modeling package BAGPIPES
(Carnall et al. 2018)2, and the photometric ﬂuxes of the full
set of 11 ﬁlters where available. We assumed a single popula-
tion with a delayed τ model, deﬁned as: SFR(t) = t × e−t/τ,
where τ is the timescale of exponential decay of star forma-
tion. This model provides a good balance between ﬂexibility and
simplicity, with exponential drop-oﬀ allowing a span from the
strongly bursty to much more extended SFHs. Of the dust at-
tenuation laws implemented in BAGPIPES, we assumed (Calzetti
et al. 2000) law, extrapolated to the FUV by a power law (Car-
nall et al. 2018), allowing AV to vary between 0 and 4 mag, and
allowed the redshift to vary freely between 0 and 10. We enabled
BAGPIPES’ built-in support for CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 2017) as-
suming log U = −3 and otherwise using the default settings; this
would allow BAGPIPES to also correctly model strong emission
line galaxies. BAGPIPES assumes pure Case B recombination
and thus zero ionizing escape from the model galaxy (Carnall
et al. 2018, Sect. 3).

For IGM absorption, BAGPIPES adopts the analytical ver-
sion of the IGM transmission law for T (λ, zobs) by Inoue et al.
(2014), assuming that all ﬂux with λ < 912Å is absorbed (this
is however already the case when nebular emission is enabled,
see Carnall et al. 2018, Sect. 3). We keep in mind that the as-
sumption of zero transmission of IGM could lead BAGPIPES to
interpret all data points with nonzero ﬂux as being non-ionizing
and thus be skewed towards lower-redshift solutions. Mostly, the

2 BAGPIPES uses the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar models, the
Multinest (Feroz et al. 2019) sampling algorithm and its python in-
terface PyMultiNest (Buchner et al. 2014).

UV ﬁlters have low SNR compared to the optical and IR ﬁlters,
but if the optical/IR data is more or less evenly consistent with
two diﬀerent models, the presence of nonzero UV ﬂuxes may tip
it in favor of the lower-redshift solution.

We then compared the photometric redshifts to those pub-
lished by Rafelski et al. (2015), as well as the MUSE spectro-
scopic redshifts published by Inami et al. (2017). Where spec-
troscopic redshifts exist, we have relied on those. Due to the
assumption hard coded into BAGPIPES that no ionizing ﬂux
reaches the telescope, the minimization algorithm will, if al-
lowed, attempt to adjust the redshift to interpret all bands with
measured ﬂux to fall below the Lyman edge at λrest=912 Å. How-
ever, the UV bands have considerably poorer SNR and are less
numerous than the optical bands, which counteracts this eﬀect.
See discussion of individual objects in sect. 5.2.

3.5.6. Test of redshift with emission lines

For the galaxies in the ﬁnal candidate selection which show
Lyman-α emission, we have measured the equivalent width by
measuring the continuum-subtracted line ﬂux in the MUSE spec-
tra, and dividing it by the ﬂux density as measured in an aperture
of the same size in the HST ﬁlter containing λobs,Lyα. The contin-
uum in MUSE is noisy, and an unknown fraction of it consists of
scattered light from the atmosphere, so we preferred the deeper,
less contaminated continuum levels from HST imaging. In the
case of F336W-1013, Lyα falls between F435W and F606W,
and we have used a simple average of the ﬂuxes in those ﬁlters
to compute the equivalent width. The resulting observed-frame
EWs are tabulated in table 4 along with a number of physical pa-
rameters derived from a second round of SED modelling using
BAGPIPES, see Sect. 4.1.

The computed equivalent widths are useful to check for
misclassiﬁed spectral emission lines. The observed-frame EWs
range from 118 to 210 Å which in the restframe yield ∼ 30–50Å.
Other comparably strong emission lines are found from rest-
frame [O ii] λλ 3727,3929 Å and redward, where the redshift cor-
rections to the measured EWs are lower by roughly a factor 3 or
more. This leaves only few lines which could be consistent with
the measured values. For example, [O ii] λλ 3726,3729, could
possibly be consistent with the measured lines, but this feature
is a multiplet; and at such redshifts, lines such as Hβ, the [O iii]
doublet at λλ 4960,5008 Å, and Hα would all fall within the red-
shift range of the spectrograph, none of which are found. We also
note the dual asymmetric peaks shape of the line in F336W-189,
a typical and unique feature of Lyα; and the clear asymmetric
shape of F336W-1041, typical of a Lyα line at modest SNR.

3.5.7. Final selection

The previous steps in combination left us with a selection of
seven objects of interest, listed with their R15 and I17 counter-
parts where available in Table 1. The strongest candidates shown
in bold type in Table 1 and subsequent tables. These all have
spectroscopic redshifts in I17 at reported at conﬁdence levels
2 (F336W-1013, F336W-1041) or 3 (F336W-189, F336W-554),
and we were able to conﬁrm the spectroscopic redshifts from
our own extracted spectra. In addition, these candidates all have
ﬂux measured at at least 2σ in at least two ﬁlters which are en-
tirely in the rest-frame Lyman Continuum at the spectroscopic
redshift, except for (F336W-1013).

In addition, we have identiﬁed three second-tier candidate
objects which we consider highly likely, but not deﬁnitive, leak-

ers. Two of them have no spectroscopic redshift, but the avail-
able photometric redshifts are high enough that the ﬂux in the
FUV ﬁlters must be dominated by LyC; and one has a convincing
spectroscopic redshift which is however only marginally consis-
tent with being a LyC leaker. See Sec. 5.2 for a discussion of
each.

Fig. 5 shows 1.7(cid:48)(cid:48) square cut-outs in the ﬁlters from F225W
to F775W, as well as an RGB composite of the ﬁlters F775W,
F606W, and F435W in the R, G and B channels, respectively.

4. Candidate characterization

4.1. Fixed-aperture photometry & global SED modeling

Up to this point, all ﬂuxes have been measured in the segments
created from the source detection in the UV ﬁlters. The young
stellar populations that dominate production of UV photons is
generally signiﬁcantly more compact than the older population
which often dominates the optical and IR bands. Our choice of
aperture thus yields comparatively high ﬂuxes in the UV ﬁlters
compared to what would result from photometry of the entire
galaxy.

To derive global physical properties for the candidate galax-
ies rather than local properties for the often small regions de-
ﬁned by the segmentation maps, we have supplemented these
measurements with ﬁxed-aperture photometry for the objects we
found to be LyC leaker candidates. We chose a ﬁxed circular
aperture 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 8 in diameter, which is large enough to encompass
the majority of most galaxies in the relevant redshift range, and
small enough to keep the risk of contamination from nearby ob-
jects small. In ﬁg. 3, we show the resulting spectral energy dis-
tributions for the candidate objects listed in Table 2, this time
shown in AB magnitudes. The same magnitudes are tabulated
in table 3. Note that that this larger aperture made the MC sam-
pling of uncertainties unfeasible. With aperture size grows also
the probability of catching a bright nearby object in the aper-
ture which will skew the standard deviation. For this reason, we
have found this method unfeasible with a 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 8 aperture, and have
opted to simply report the uncertainties found from the RMS
frames. Additionally, the compactness in the UV bands has the
consequence that a larger number of pixels will contribute. As
a result, the errors reported from ﬁxed apertures are markedly
larger than from segmentation images, with some measurements
being consistent with 0 within 1σ. We have opted to report these
as measurements with error bars rather than upper limits in ta-
ble 3 and ﬁgures 3 and 6, but have not based any quantitative
conclusions on these.

After completing the redshift and color selection process, we
revisited the BAGPIPES SED ﬁtting for the remaining candidate
objects, this time based on ﬂuxes extracted from the ﬁxed-size
apertures. This time, we ﬁxed the redshifts at the spectroscopic
values where available, and in the two cases where this was not
the case, we left it open as a free parameter. Again, we assumed
a delayed τ model, ﬁnding it to be the one single model which
can cover the widest range of physical properties, but this time
we imposed a metallicity constraint of Z ≤ Z(cid:12). In table 4, we
tabulate the best-ﬁt values of core properties obtained from this
second run.

4.2. Ionizing escape fractions

Following Steidel et al. (2001); Siana et al. (2007, 2010);
Grazian et al. (2016); Fletcher et al. (2019) we deﬁne the rel-
ative and absolute escape fraction in the following way:

esc ×TIGM, and then apply a corrective term
to account for IGM absorption as described in the next section.

We have estimated the absolute ionizing escape fraction by
comparing observed LyC ﬂuxes to modeled intrinsic ﬂuxes in
the following way: For each best-ﬁt BAGPIPES model, we con-
structed a model galaxy based on the ﬁt, but omitting the eﬀects
of internal dust, ISM, and IGM absorption. We then compared
the observed LyC ﬂuxes in the reference LyC ﬁlters shown in
Fig. 5. The fraction of model-to-observed ﬂux is the combined
transmission galaxy ISM and the IGM. We then estimated the
relative escape fraction of each candidate, by applying the best-
ﬁt dust attenuation at rest-frame 1500 to the absolute fraction.

Fig. 7 shows for each candidate the observed ﬂuxes (blue,
ﬁlled circles), along with the best-ﬁt, IGM-attenuated spec-
trum (strong orange) and the dust-and ISM-free, but still IGM-
attenuated, model spectrum (black). Each of these is additionally
shown with the BAGPIPES-generated IGM attenuation removed,
shown in a lighter tone (pale orange, gray). Synthetic HST ﬁl-
ter photometry, also generated by BAGPIPES, is shown as open
circles in the colors of the corresponding model spectrum. The
absolute escape fraction can then be visually understood as the
fraction of the values marked by the ﬁlled blue to the open gray
circle in the reference LyC ﬁlter. It is worth noting that while a
similar interpretation of the relative escape fraction as ratio of
the ﬁlled blue to open light orange circles would be physically
correct, that is not the value found as f rel
esc using the convention
described above. The latter convention assumes the dust attenu-
ation to be the same at 900 and 1500 Å and is thus lower than
what would be found by directly measuring the ratio of escaping
to dust-corrected intrinsic ﬂux at 900 Å; the discrepancy between
the two will depend on the choice of dust attenuation law.

It is interesting to note from inspection of Fig. 7 that while
the relative escape fractions can be even quite dramatically
higher than 100%, all absolute escape fractions seem roughly
consistent with being (cid:46) 1, even for an object like F336W-1013,
for which the relative escape fraction is ∼ 450% (see Table 5)
after IGM correction. The relative escape fraction is computed
based on the assumption that the light from the stars responsible
for emitting LyC undergo the same dust attenuation as the full
stellar population, on which the galaxy model is built. However,
recent studies of the Magellanic clouds (Ramachandran et al.
2018b,c, 2019; Doran et al. 2013) have shown that the ionizing
output from a galaxy can be completely dominated by as little as
one to a few dozen extremely luminous, massive stars. If these
stars are seen along a privileged line of sight through the dust
in their galaxy, they could conceivably be much less attenuated
than the greater stellar population. This could either be due to
a highly clumpy dust geometry, or to the stars dominating LyC
emission being located away from the stars emitting the bulk of
rest-frame 1500Å photons (see e.g. Ramachandran et al. 2021,
for an example of O stars residing in the tidal bridge between
the Magellanic Clouds).

One candidate, F336W-1041, has an absolute escape fraction
of ∼ 100% even before IGM correction and thus requires an es-
sentially completely dust- and gas free line of sight between the
emitting stars and the telescope for the observed escape fraction
to be physical, and other candidates require similar, intrinsically
quite unlikely, constraints on intervening dust and HI column to
be fulﬁlled. However, it should be kept in mind that we have
inferred a strong selection bias for exactly such conditions.

where ( f1500/ f900)Int and ( f1500/ f900)Obs are the intrinsic and ob-

line of sight, and A1500 is the attenuation at rest-frame wave-
length 1500 Å in magnitudes. Often, an intrinsic ﬂux ratio of
( f1500/ f900)Int = 3 (in fν units) is assumed (e.g. Steidel et al.
2001; Grazian et al. 2016, 2017); however, the value has been
found to vary from 1.7 at a burst age of 1 Myr, to 7.1 at 0.2 Gyr
of age, using the stellar population library of Bruzual & Charlot
(2003)(Grazian et al. 2016), and where possible, it is preferable
to estimate the intrinsic ratio for each individual galaxy.

parameters, but with ISM and dust removed, are shown in black. Gray spectra show the ISM- and dust-free model spectra corrected

4.3. IGM correction

BAGPIPES accounts for IGM attenuation following Inoue et al.
(2014), applying an average redshift-dependent IGM attenuation
curves derived in that paper (Carnall et al. 2018). While this can
be very useful to generate a realistic, generic model galaxy at
a given redshift, IGM absorption along a given line of sight is
highly stochastic, as shown in e.g. Vanzella et al. (2015); Vasei
et al. (2016); Bassett et al. (2021, 2022). Speciﬁcally, Jones et al.
(2021, Fig. 6) show that the average IGM optical depth to LyC
changes drastically over the range of wavelengths of this work.
In addition, as discussed above, in this work, we are selecting

speciﬁcally for high-transmission lines of sight, and thus an un-
biased average is unlikely to be a good approximation to lines of
sight actually observed.

To obtain a realistic estimate of the impact of IGM absorp-
tion on the observed LyC ﬂuxes, we ﬁrst run Monte Carly sim-
ulations of 1000 random, unbiased lines of sight following the
prescription given by Inoue et al. (2014). We next imposed as
a prior constraint on these lines of sight that they must be con-
sistent with an f abs
esc ≤ 100%. All lines of sight not meeting this
requirement were removed from the LOS distribution. Next, f abs
esc
was found assuming the IGM opacity of each line of sight, and

Notes. (a) The quoted uncertainties here are an estimate based on the assumption that the true SNR of the large-aperture photometry is the same
as the corrected SNR in the segmentation map photometry (see Sect. 3.4), and assuming no uncertainties due to the stellar population modeling.
They are not propagated further.
(b) No uncertainties are quoted here, as the relative and absolute escape fraction only diﬀer by a dust correction term adopted from the BAGPIPES
best-ﬁt galaxy model.
(c) Uncertainties quoted here are based solely on the simulated IGM transmission distribution. Uncertainties in this quantity and in fesc are highly
degenerate.

a resulting distribution of escape fractions was found. For each
candidate, we then report the mean and standard deviation of this
distribution as the escape fraction. One galaxy, F336W-1041, has
f abs
esc ≈ 100%, requiring an IGM transmission of unity, to which
we have ﬁxed it.

In Table 5, we report the measured and absolute escape frac-
tions without IGM correction, as well as the derived mean and
standard deviation of the IGM transmission coeﬃcient TIGM, and
the resulting IGM-corrected absolute escape fractions. Uncer-
tainties quoted for the latter are based solely on the IGM distribu-
tion; the galaxy models and measured LyC ﬂuxes are assumed as
is, without uncertainties. The uncertainties on the model galaxies
are dominated by systematics due to the choice of star forma-
tion history, dust attenuation law etc., and the uncertainties on
the IGM transmission and the measured LyC ﬂuxes are highly
degenerate. A stricter treatment of uncertainties of the escape
fractions would entail a full MC sampling of the LyC ﬂuxes for
a variety of SF histories and dust attenuation models, as well as
creating a full TIGM distribution for each realization, which is
outside the scope of this work.

4.4. Contribution to ionizing background

We have estimated the contribution from our candidate objects
to the metagalactic ionizing background at redshifts 2 < z < 3.5
broadly following the methodology of Jones et al. (2021, Sect.
6). We have converted the measured ﬂux densities to an ionizing
emissivity at 900 Å (cid:15)900, deﬁned as the luminosity density at 900
Å per unit frequency per unit comoving volume.

For each of the candidates, we have used the ﬂux density
in the reference LyC ﬁlter shown in Fig. 5, and assumed the
measured ﬁlter average as the value at 900 Å. This conversion
assumes that the measured ﬂux in this ﬁlter is a good represen-
tation of the spectral ﬂux density at rest-frame 900 Å or, equiv-
alently, that the spectral shape of the Lyman Continuum in the
wavelength ranges covered by these ﬁlters is constant in fν units.
Looking at the ﬂuxes in Fig. 6, the measured diﬀerences between
the reddest and neighboring bluer ﬁlter are nowhere more than
× ∼ 1.5, making this an imperfect but reasonable assumption.

We computed an ionizing luminosity density from each mea-
sured ﬂux density by correcting it for IGM absorption using the
values derived in the previous section, and multiplying the result

by 4πD2
L, where DL is the luminosity distance at the given red-
shift. We then computed the comoving volume deﬁned by the
dA = 160(cid:48)(cid:48) angular size of the UVUDF and the redshift range
deﬁned by our ﬁlters, 2 < z < 3.5, as:

(4)

where Ac(z) is the comoving area deﬁned by the angular size
dA of the ﬁeld at redshift z, and drc(z)/dz is the thickness of
the slab deﬁned by the redshift diﬀerence dz at redshift z. We
have assumed that measured LyC emission is isotropic which
is not generally a good approximation for single galaxies, but
which from symmetry considerations should be a reasonable as-
sumption for the number of sources existing in the HUDF within
our redshift range. We have found found a resulting value of
log10((cid:15)) = 25.32+0.25
−0.21 (25.29+0.27
−0.22) erg s-1 Hz-1 cMpc-3 for the
full (tier 1 only) set of candidates.

This value is shown in ﬁgure 8 along with predictions and
measurements from the literature. We ﬁnd that our values are
consistent with those found by Jones et al. (2021). Once cor-
rected for IGM attenuation, the resulting emissivity from star
forming galaxies is suﬃcient to maintain the measured ioniza-
tion state of the Universe up to redshift ∼ 3.5. The value we ﬁnd
for (cid:15)900 is rather high, but still consistent with, values previously
found by e.g. Jones et al. (2021), and is dominated by one galaxy,
F336W-189, which contributes 83% of the total, IGM-corrected
ionizing luminosity, owing at least in part to a strong IGM cor-
rection. With its high redshift and low value of fescabs × TIGM, it
allows allows for low-transmission IGM lines of sight and thus
drives the median IGM correction up.

We estimated the eﬀect of cosmic variance on our results us-
ing the QUICKCV cosmic variance calculator (Newman & Moster
2014; Moster et al. 2011) and, independently the Trenti & Sti-
avelli online cosmic variance calculator3 (Trenti & Stiavelli
2008). Both yielded an estimated cosmic variance of ∼15-20%
on the emissivity, signiﬁcantly less important than the uncertain-
ties stemming from photometry and the inherent stochasticity of
the IGM.

the horizontal yellow bar), with an average redshift of 2.81.

5. Discussion

Resulting from our selection and inspection criteria, we have
compiled a set of candidate LyC leaker galaxies falling into two
tiers as described in Sect. 3.5.7. Based on best-ﬁt models of their
stellar populations, we have derived intrinsic and dust-attenuated
LyC outputs and, based on these as well as Monte Carlo simu-
lations of the IGM, derived the absolute and relative LyC es-
cape fraction of each candidate galaxy. We have found that while
some galaxies have surprisingly strong LyC ﬂuxes, they are all
roughly consistent with an absolute escape fraction of (cid:46) 100%.
However, some of the candidates show relative escape fractions
of several hundred percent, something which requires the LyC
emitting stars to be seen through a considerably lower dust col-
umn than the general stellar population dominating the optical
and IR ﬁlters. We discuss these cases below.

We then used the resulting IGM absorption distributions to
convert the observed LyC ﬂux densities to a cosmic volume
emissivity (cid:15)900, and compared it to theoretical and observed val-
ues in the literature. We ﬁnd a value which is surprisingly high,
but consistent with measured values from the literature (Becker
& Bolton 2013; Jones et al. 2021). The emissivity is dominated
by one galaxy, F336W-189, which contributes 82% of the com-
bined volume emissivity, with F336W-1013 contributing an ad-
ditional 10%. Both galaxies have high redshifts and as a result,
a TIGM -distribution skewed towards low transmission and thus
a strong ISM correction. Despite the fact that as much as four of
our candidate galaxies are unlikely to have been found in any
typical preselection methods, it is thus not immediately clear
how important their contribution to the cosmic ionizing back-

ground is, mainly due to the statistical uncertainty in the IGM
corrections.

5.1. Strongest candidates

F336W-189: This galaxy was also identiﬁed by Saxena et al.
(2022), and is our strongest candidate. It is bright, has a
strong and unmistakable Lyman-α emission line (see ﬁg. 4)
which determines its redshift beyond any reasonable doubt,
and the MUSE and Photutils centroids are coincident to
within 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 1. It is detected in three bands in LyC, and its
spectral energy distribution is textbook example of what we
would expect a star-forming galaxy with a modest f LyC
to
esc
look like. It was detected in F275W but rejected because it
is fainter in F336W than F275W, because both ﬁlters are in
the rest-frame LyC. We ﬁnd a stellar mass of log(M∗) = 9.58
± 0.02, the most massive of the candidates. The absolute es-
cape fraction is 36% ± 22% and, after dust correction, we
ﬁnd a relative escape fraction of 325%. The Lyα line pro-
ﬁle is double-peaked with a peak separation of ∆v ≈ 620
km/s. Verhamme et al. (2015) found that a peak separation of
∆v (cid:46) 300 km/s corresponds approximately to log NHI ≈ 17,
at which point τ900Å ≈ 1, meaning that f rel
esc (LyC) for this
galaxy is a good deal higher than expected from the peak
separation (but as discussed above, the clumpy nature of dust
may have inﬂated the relative escape fraction substantially
and makes a comparison to theoretical values tricky). This
galaxy also dominates the found value of (cid:15)900, contributing
83% of the total IGM-corrected ionizing ﬂux in the searched

volume. This large contribution owes at least in part to the
low measured, IGM-uncorrected escape fraction, which is
consistent with IGM lines of sight

F336W-554: This galaxy does not show any line emission,
emission in Lyα, but its spectroscopic redshift of 2.87 from
I17 is reported with a conﬁdence level of 3, the highest in
that work, based on multiple absorption features. The two
photometric redshifts from R15 are both slightly higher, at
2.97 and 2.97, also reported at a high conﬁdence level. The
morphology of this source seems point-like, or at least very
compact, in F336W. It is situated at the Northern tip of a
more extended feature seen only in the non-ionizing ﬁlters.
Another object is seen nearby to the NW (upper right) in all
ﬁlters. This object has ID #6770 in R15, where it has zphot ≈
1.55 with both their methods, but has no counterpart in I17.
The two galaxies are well separated visually, but at a pro-
jected physical distance of ∼ 5 kpc. at z=1.55, it is in prin-
ciple possible that a source associated with this object could
contaminate our source, but given the more obvious associ-
ation with the source to the south with secure spectroscopic
redshift, we believe it represents genuine LyC emission. The
ﬂuxes measured in the rest-frame LyC for this object are very
high. It is quite young and with log(M∗) ≈ 8.8 in the lower
mass end of our candidate list. It does however contain quite
a lot of dust, which seems diﬃcult to reconcile with such
strong LyC emission. Indeed, while the absolute escape frac-
tion is 67%, the relative escape fraction is measured to 876%.
While this is the highest of the derived relative escape frac-
tions, as much as four galaxies have f rel
esc > 100%. This is
possible if the LyC emitting stars are seen through a dust
column which is considerably lower than that of the stellar
population dominating in the optical and IR ﬁlters and thus
the stellar population models. It is well known that dust can
be highly unevenly distributed in starburst galaxies (see e.g.
Menacho et al. 2021, Fig. 4 for an example). Additionally,
it has been shown that the LyC output of a galaxy often is
dominated by a few, perhaps as little as one or two, bright
O or WR stars (Ramachandran et al. 2018a,c, 2019; Doran
et al. 2013). These stars can in some circumstances form in
the outskirts of galaxies, e.g. as is the case of the Magellanic
Bridge which contains at least 3 bright O stars (Ramachan-
dran et al. 2021). The LyC detected in F336W-554 does in-
deed originate in the outskirts of the galaxy, in a region that
is quite faint in the optical and IR bands.

F336W-1013: This galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift from
I17 of 2.98, which we have conﬁrmed based on a Lyman
α line emission at ∼ 4840 Å. The photometric redshift meth-
ods consistently converge on a redshift ∼ 2, which could be
due to the assumption of a zero ionizing escape built-in to
BAGPIPES. The galaxy was detected using F336W as detec-
tion ﬁlter. It has signiﬁcant ionizing ﬂux in F275W, and was
also found in the source detection step, but fell for the color
criterion and was rejected. The galaxy has an ionizing es-
cape fraction of a moderate 15 ± 10% which, in combination
with its redshift, leads to a strong IGM correction of the ion-
izing ﬂux, making this galaxy the second strongest contrib-
utor to the ionizing volume emissivity (cid:15)900, delivering 10%
of the total amount of photons. The relative escape fraction
= 450% is another example of a galaxy where the
of f rel
esc
relative escape fraction indicates that the ionizing emission
predominantly reaches us through lines of sight which are
not typical for the general stellar population. Looking at the
F275W cut-out of this galaxy in ﬁg. 5, there is a brighter
area to the W of the central object which, like the artifact

Article number, page 14 of 22

next to F336W-1041, is not present in the non-PSF matched
archival frames or the optical or IR frames. We performed
the same tests as for F336W-1041 (see sect. 5.5), measur-
ing signal and noise in the non-PSF matched data, to check
whether the main object, F336W-1013, could be a similar
artifact, but found that it persisted at a very similar signal-
to-noise as in the PSF matched data. The actual object is ac-
tually fainter than this possibly spurious, feature, meaning
that at ﬁrst glance it could easily be discarded as spurious,
were it not for its complete spatial coincidence with the fea-
ture found in the non-ionizing bands. We thus believe it to
be real, but the nature of the neighboring feature is still an
open question. There is a hint of the same feature, with the
same shape, in F336W, but not in any other band. However,
none of these concerns are strong, and the Lyα emission line
has been identiﬁed with strong certainty, for which reason
we have placed this galaxy among our most convincing can-
didates.

F336W-1041: This galaxy consistently converges on a photo-
metric redshift of ∼ 2.0–2.2 both in our computations and in
R15, but has a bright Lyα emission line at redshift z=3.33
(see ﬁg. 4), which is also its designated redshift in I17, with
a reported conﬁdence level of 2; we speculate that as in the
case of F336W-1013, the built-in assumption of zero ioniz-
ing escape in BAGPIPES might have skewed its solution to-
wards a lower redshift. There are no strong emission lines
consistent with the location of the one observed which cor-
respond to redshifts between 2.0 and 2.2. The high observed
equivalent width of the emission feature limits which other
lines it could conceivably be, as does the clearly asymmetri-
cal line proﬁle.
F336W-1041 has a relative escape fraction of 662% and an
absolute escape fraction of just over, but consistent with,
100%. This means that not only must the line of sight to
the LyC sources be completely free of internal stars and dust
in the galaxy; also the LOS through the IGM must be es-
sentially free of neutral Hydrogen. This is clearly a priori
a very unlikely situation; however, as discussed above, our
entire selection process is strongly favoring such a scenario
among thousands of originally detected sources, and as ar-
gued above, the scenario is not implausible.
The thumbnails in ﬁg. 5 show that the there is a nearby object
to the NE of the galaxy. This companion has almost identical
redshift in I17 (see Tab. 2), which we interpret as the two be-
ing an interacting pair, and which means that any cross con-
tamination between the two stems from eﬀectively the same
redshift and thus will not give rise to false detection in LyC.
The ﬂux is surprisingly strong in the LyC, leading to won-
der whether we could be looking at a foreground interloper,
but both UV, optical/IR imaging and Lyα emission centroid
coincide within a small distance, and the only other visi-
ble object in the vicinity has a spectroscopic redshift which
would put its rest-frame LyC emission within the same ﬁl-
ter as this object. The possibility of a near-perfect alignment
with a faint foreground interloper exists, but is statistically
very unlikely (Siana et al. 2010; Nestor et al. 2013).

5.2. Other candidates

As discussed in sect. 3.5.7, our tier-2 candidates are what we
consider likely, but not deﬁnite, candidates. Two of them have
convincing and consistent photometric redshifts which corre-
spond to a rather strong LyC emission, but lack spectroscopic
redshift. One has a spectroscopic redshift, but in one UV ﬁlter,

T. E. Rivera-Thorsen et al.: Lyman Continuum escape in the UVUDF

it has SNR < 2, and the next straddles the Lyman break such
that the LyC detection there becomes model dependent. The last
object has a spectroscopic redshift of 2.98, at which LyC is de-
tected by a solid margin, but the three photometric redshifts are
consistently ∼ 2, which we ﬁnd calls for caution.

F275W-314: This is the lowest-redshift and perhaps also the
least convincing object in the selection. However, it does
have a solid spectroscopic redshift, a >1σ detection in the
rest-frame LyC ﬁlter F225W, and a ﬂux in the Lyman edge
straddling ﬁlter F275W which is diﬃcult to reconcile with
the inferred stellar population. However, this galaxy requires
deeper imaging in F225W or a similar ﬁlter to be properly
convincing.

F275W-2055: This galaxy is not included in I17, and we found
no strong emission lines or convincing absorption lines in
the MUSE spectrum. Our initial BAGPIPES run yielded z =
2.07 ± 0.08, while the two methods of R15 yielded z = 2.43
and z = 2.26, respectively. However, in our initial SED mod-
eling, we allowed metallicity to vary freely, which yielded an
unbelievably high metallicity for this galaxy of Z (cid:38) 2 × Z(cid:12).
In our second round of SED ﬁtting, we constrained the metal-
licity to be equal to or below solar, which bumped up the
inferred redshift to z = 2.33 ± 0.29, better in line with the
measurements of R15. A redshift of z = 2.38 is where <1%
of the integrated ﬂux in the ﬁlter (for a ﬂat spectrum in fλ
units) falls redward of the Lyman edge, but the observed ﬂux
in F336W for this galaxy becomes diﬃcult to account for
without invoking LyC escape already at redshifts z (cid:38) 2.2, as
can be seen in ﬁg. 6. Even at the original z = 2.07, the mea-
sured ﬂux in F275W is inconsistent with the best-ﬁt model if
we assume no LyC escape within ∼2σ. An even lower red-
shift, or a signiﬁcantly bluer UV spectrum, could bring the
measured SED within consistency with an absence of ioniz-
ing escape. We note again that the redshift is also downward
biased in the ﬁtting process by the built-in assumption of no
ionizing escape. When the UV ﬁlters have lower statistical
weight due to the larger aperture size and the metallicity is
constrained to sub-solar values, the ﬁt settles on a redshift en-
tirely consistent with those from R15. In this redshift range,
the segment based ﬂux in this galaxy is inconsistent with an
fesc of zero. The large-aperture F275W ﬂux in this galaxy has
a very large error bar, but as mentioned above, two eﬀects in-
ﬂate this artiﬁcially. One is the aperture size in itself, which
includes more noise to the same signal; the other is that the
noise is generally overestimated. We can get a rough esti-
mate of the latter by looking at Fig. C.1, middle panel. Here,
the green point cloud shows the ratio of RMS-based to MC-
derived errors in the segments, plotted against the measured
ﬂux in the segments. The F275W-segment of F275W-2055
has a ﬂux of roughly 0.8 × 1020 ergs/s/cm2/Å, meaning that
the error on the ﬂux was over estimated by a factor of ∼ 3.
We ﬁnd this object convincing, but have assigned it Tier 2
due solely to the lack of a spectroscopic redshift.

F336W-606: The second of two candidates which has no spec-
troscopic redshift. For this galaxy, the R15 photometric red-
shifts are 2.50 and 2.69. Our original BAGPIPES redshift is
2.41 which however shifts to z = 2.73 when the metallicity
is constrained as described above. The galaxy has SNR > 2 in
all three UV ﬁlters, but only picked up by our detection and
ﬁltering procedure when using F336W as detection ﬁlter. In
F225W, it falls for the color criterion. It is unclear what is
the reason why it is rejected when using F275W, but given
the faintness of the source, it is conceivable that the struc-
tured noise could have been included in the image segment,

and the diﬀerence in segment shape could dilute the SNR
below the 2σ threshold. Morphologically, this is a complex
object which consists of one major, bright, compact feature
to the SW, and a collection of multiple fainter clumps to the
NE (see Fig. 5). These features are all treated as one fea-
ture in R15, while we have based our SED modeling on a
small segment of the NE feature collection, and even in the
0(cid:48)(cid:48). 8 aperture, the two parts are separate. The combination of
strong ﬂux and consistent photometric redshifts make this an
interesting candidate object, but the lack of a spectroscopic
redshift is is a concern.

5.3. Other LyC surveys in overlapping ﬁelds

5.3.1. Jones et al. 2021

Jones et al. (2021) carry out a search for Lyman-continuum
leakers in the GOODS ﬁelds using the publicly available
F275W observations from the HDUV survey and archival
spectroscopic catalogs to select galaxies in the redshift range
2.35 < z < 3.05, in which the HST F275W ﬁlter probes only the
Lyman-continuum, while the adjacent F336W at least partially
probes the non-ionizing UV continuum. Given coordinates and
redshifts from the HDUV catalogs, they then lay down a 2”
circular aperture on the given locations in F225W, and measure
the ﬂux in search of signiﬁcant LyC detection, and then go
through various steps to control for contamination from inter-
loping galaxies. They ﬁnd three candidate objects in GOODS-S,
of which one, a galaxy at z = 2.678 is contained in the UVUDF
footprint. We found this object during source detection in
F275W, but it was subsequently discarded because the segment
had a signal-to-noise in F336W of only 1.7 (SNR criterion),
and is 0.9 magnitude fainter (color criterion). We have thus not
reached the point of extracting MUSE spectra or performing
SED ﬁtting for this object. We note that our method uses
small apertures, that only encompass the bright region in the
detection image, and relatively aggressively splits any clumpy
source up in multiple segments. This means that our method is
quite robust to contamination from nearby objects, while it is
vulnerable towards conﬁgurations where the ionizing radiation
may emanate from regions that are faint in non-ionizing UV
continuum. Jones et al. use a larger aperture, encompassing the
entire galaxy and catching all ﬂux within a radius of 1“, making
this method more robust to scenarios where there is an angular
oﬀset between ionizing and non-ionizing UV radiation, but more
vulnerable towards inaccuracies in background subtraction,
contamination from adjacent objects, etc. Jones et al. do not
ﬁnd our object F336W-554; It is unclear why, as these authors
have used the catalogs of I17 for preselection of candidates,
and the object is found within the redshift ranges that they probe.

5.3.2. Saxena et al. 2021

Saxena et al. (2022) search for LyC leakers in the CDF-S, a
superset of the HUDF. In their work, they look at galaxies at
3.1 < z < 3.4 pre-selected from photometry or MUSE-DEEP,
ﬁnd spectroscopic redshifts in the VANDELS catalogs (McLure
et al. 2018), and look for LyC emission in archival photomet-
ric data. They ﬁnd 11 LyC leaker candidates in the greater ﬁeld,
of which 4 are contained in the HUDF, including the one we
label F336W-189 and these authors label CDFS-12448. Interest-
ingly, this object is the only overlap between our candidates and
those of Saxena et al.: Our method did not yield either of their

Article number, page 15 of 22

A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper

other 3 objects inside the footprint of the UVUDF: CDFS-13385,
CDFS-15718, or CDFS-16444.

CDFS 12448: As discussed above, this is the same object that
we denote F336W–189, and we agree that it is a strong Ly-
man continuum leaker candidate.

CDFS 13385: We detected this galaxy in all the three detection
passes. In F225W and F275W, it fell for the color criterion
discussed in sect. 3.5.2, meaning that the detection ﬁlter was
brighter in AB magnitudes than the next redward ﬁlter. When
detected using F336W, it passed these criteria and was se-
lected for SED ﬁtting. Our SED ﬁtting yielded a photometric
redshift of z = 0.46+0.009
−0.26 . We compared this to Rafelski et al.
(2015) who reported the redshifts z = 0.09 and z = 0.20 with
their two independent methods. In Inami et al. (2017), the
object’s redshift is reported with a conﬁdence level of 2 out
of 3, or “fairly strong”, based on identiﬁcation of Lyman-α
in emission. However, given the SED and the agreement be-
tween the three photometric redshifts, we ﬁnd it likely that
the redshift in Inami et al. (2017) is based on a misclassi-
ﬁed [O ii] λλ 3727,3729 doublet which at a redshift of ∼0.44
would fall at the wavelength of Lyman α at the redshift re-
ported by Inami et al.. At this redshift, the doublet would
have a peak separation of ∼ 4 Å, corresponding to a peak
separation of ∼ 225 km/s, which could reasonably be mis-
taken for a z = 3.4 Lyα proﬁle by an automated survey.
CDFS 15718: This galaxy is not detected in the HST UV ﬁlters
in the UVUDF, despite these observations being quite deep.
At its redshift of z ≈ 3.44, the Lyman edge falls around 4050
Å, close to the red edge of the NB396 narrow band ﬁlter at
the 2.2M telescope at La Silla, in which they have observed
the reported LyC emission. F336W, on the other hand, falls
blueward of NB396, between ∼ 3100 and ∼ 3700 Å. It is pos-
sible that a Lyman Limit system exists between the galaxy’s
redshift of 3.44 and z∼3.05, where LyC would enter the red
side of F336W. This could conceivably allow a window of
LyC to reach Earth and be be detected in NB396 but not
F336W.

CDFS 16444: We have not detected this galaxy in F336W ei-
ther. As with CDFS 15718, Saxena et al. report this galaxy
detected in Lyman-continuum in the NB396 ﬁlter. This
galaxy is located at z = 3.13, leaving the window of 3.05 <
z < 3.14 for a possible Lyman Limit system to absorb escap-
ing LyC on its blue side.

Conversely, the method of Saxena et al. did not yield either of
the objects labeled F336W-1041 or F336W-554 in this work. The
latter is easily explained, as its spectroscopic redshift is outside
their redshift range of interest. F336W-1041, on the other hand,
is within the redshift range, but not listed among their candidates.

5.3.3. Redshift distribution

Of the three redshift bins deﬁned by the wavelengths of the de-
tection ﬁlters, our leaker candidates were found predominantly
in the highest redshift bin, with no candidates found in the lowest
redshift bin. The latter can be at least partially explained by the
large overlap in transmission of F225W and F275W; the volume
unique to F225W is small, and F275W is deeper. If the Lyman
edge of a galaxy falls within F225W, the distinction between
ionizing and non-ionizing radiation becomes diﬃcult and model
dependent. If on the other hand it falls entirely redward of this
ﬁlter, only a narrow redshift window exists before it also drops
out of F275W.

Article number, page 16 of 22

It is somewhat surprising that we ﬁnd the leaking candidates
so predominantly at higher redshift, given that the IGM becomes
more opaque at the higher redshifts. The co-moving volumes
probed by the two highest-redshift ﬁlters are the same order of
magnitude, but the higher neutral IGM fraction in the highest
redshift bin (3.05 < z (cid:46) 4) should, if average galaxy proper-
ties were unchanged, result in a substantially larger number of
LyC emitting galaxies in the lower redshift bin. Galaxy proper-
ties are however not unchanged over redshifts. While the cosmic
star formation rate is largely unchanged over this redshift range
(Madau & Dickinson 2014), the LAE fraction does rise (Stark
et al. 2010; Hayes et al. 2011); which is generally believed to
be a good statistical tracer of Lyman Continuum emission (e.g.
Matthee et al. 2022; Naidu et al. 2022, and references therein).
Thus, the numbers of intrinsic leakers, and their average escape
fractions, is expected to rise with redshift.

In addition, there is an observational bias owing to F336W
being considerably deeper than the other two FUV ﬁlters, and
the ACS F435W ﬁlter used to retain detections is signiﬁcantly
deeper yet.

5.4. Discrepancies in dust attenuation of ionizing and

nonionizing ﬁlters

We have found in in sect. 4.2 that in order for our derived escape
fractions to be physical, we must assume that the stars domi-
nating the LyC output are seen through a substantially thinner
dust cover than the larger population emitting the bulk of rest-
frame 1500 Å photons. After IGM correction, we report relative
escape fractions of several hundred percent in some of our can-
didates. However, all absolute escape fractions found are con-
sistent with physical values, so the relative escape fractions are
only unphysical if requiring that the LyC sources and the general
stellar population be seen through the same dust cover; the situa-
tion is diﬀerent if we are seeing the LyC emitting stars through a
more modest dust cover. As touched upon in that section, this is
not an unreasonable assumption, given that dust has been found
to be highly clumpy in nearby galaxies such as Haro 11 (Östlin
et al. 2015, 2021; Menacho et al. 2019, Rivera-Thorsen et al.
in prep.), and given that the LyC output of star-forming galax-
ies can be dominated by a small number of very luminous O
stars, sometimes as few as one or two. For these, stochastic vari-
ations in the line-of-sight HI and dust column can be expected
to play a substantially larger role than for the larger surround-
ing, LyC-faint population. This uncertainty in the relative dust
attenuations at λ < 900Åvs.λ ≈ 1500Å should be kept in mind
when drawing conclusions about cosmic LyC output based on
measured relative escape fractions.

5.5. F336W artifacts near F336W-1013 and F336W-1041

As is seen in the thumbnails of ﬁg. 5, a feature is visible in
F336W to the N of the central source which is somewhat re-
moved from the source seen to the NE of the central source in the
optical and IR ﬁlters. The features are shown in a larger size in
Fig. E.1. This feature was picked up and assigned the ID F336W-
1043 by our source detection process, but rejected in subsequent
steps due to the lack of a source in the same location in the opti-
cal ﬁlters. It did however raise concerns as to whether faint fore-
ground interloper was present in this location. However, when
returning to the non-PSF matched archival data, the source was
not present, and neither is it present in these data when applying
a smoothing kernel. We speculate that this might be an artifact of

T. E. Rivera-Thorsen et al.: Lyman Continuum escape in the UVUDF

the PSF matching process, but have no explanation for it. To test
whether a similar eﬀect might have led to the feature detected
as F336W-1041, we measured ﬂux and noise in an aperture at
this location in the non-PSF matched image, but found that both
ﬂux and error estimate were similar to what we found in the PSF
matched image.

A similar artifact is present in the thumbnail of F336W-1013,
which was likewise not found in the non-PSF-matched images,
while the ﬂux measured in the source itself was consistent be-
tween the raw and PSF matched images.

6. Summary and conclusions

In this work, we have investigated how much more ionizing ra-
diation, if any, would be picked up in a study completely elim-
inating preselection, compared to previous studies who have all
relied on a range of photometric or spectroscopic preselection
criteria for candidate identiﬁcation.

To this end, we have performed a “bottom-up” search, in
which we began by identifying all sources in the Hubble Ul-
tra Deep Field in the UV ﬁlters which correspond to rest-frame
LyC emission in the redshift range 2 < z < 3.5. We then per-
formed photometric measurements in small apertures deﬁned by
these UV-detected features in PSF-matched imaging data using
all 11 HST ﬁlters in the HUDF, and use these to apply color- and
SNR based selection criteria to eliminate sources which were
not consistent with being LyC emitters in the appropriate red-
shift ranges.

We have performed SED ﬁtting on a number of candidates
which were not rejected by the initial ﬁltering criteria, found in-
ferred photometric redshifts, and have compared these to cata-
logs of photometric and spectroscopic redshifts from the litera-
ture (Rafelski et al. 2015; Inami et al. 2017) to ﬁnd candidate
objects, combined this with visual inspections looking for pos-
sible foreground interlopers to ﬁnally select a sample of seven
galaxies divided in a tier-1 and a tier-2 sample, based on how
convincingly they met the criteria of having secure redshift mea-
surements and convincingly detected ﬂux in the rest-frame LyC.
For this sample of galaxies, we have re-extracted ﬂuxes in all
available of the 11 HUDF ﬁlters, this time using ﬁxed circular
apertures of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 8, corresponding to the ﬁducial seeing adopted
in I17, which besides being useful for direct comparison with
ground-based studies also strikes a good balance between cover-
ing the majority of a typical galaxy in this redshift range, while
being small enough to still make it unlikely to catch contami-
nating ﬂux from nearby objects. From these ﬂuxes, we have per-
formed a more stringent SED modeling, from which we derived
the reported physical properties of the galaxies. From the SED
modeled stellar populations, we have derived intrinsic ionizing
output and absolute and relative escape fractions for all candi-
dates.

Based on these measurements and models, we have com-
puted the contribution to the metagalactic ionizing background
from star formation in our survey volume, and found that cosmic
variance for this volume and in the relevant mass range is a mod-
est (cid:46) 20% in ﬂux. We have compared the results of our meth-
ods to two other recent searches for LyC leakers in overlapping
ﬁelds, (Jones et al. 2021; Saxena et al. 2022), and discuss which
strengths and vulnerabilities the various methods may have.

1. From the initial total 6512 detections (of which an unknown
number correspond to the same object in multiple ﬁlters) in
the three detection ﬁlters, covering the redshift range 2 < z <

3.5, we have found a selection of 7 candidate objects. None
of these candidates were originally detected in F225W.
2. Compared to other recent studies searching for LyC leakers
in overlapping survey volumes (Jones et al. 2021; Saxena
et al. 2022) using various preselection methods, our work
has found candidates not identiﬁed by the other authors, but
also either missed or rejected candidates identiﬁed by these
authors. The candidate found by Jones et al. was rejected
because the S/N in the segment used for photometry in this
work was too low, even if it was large enough in the larger
aperture. This highlights that our method relies on the ion-
izing and nonionizing UV continuum being coincident and
compact. This is a choice informed by the fact that the hot
stars emitting strongest in the ionizing continuum also are
bright in the non-ionizing UV, and that LyC emission in
galaxies often is dominated by a few, sometimes just one
or two, hot O stars (Doran et al. 2013; Ramachandran et al.
2018a,c, 2019). However, O stars have also been observed in
more tenuous environment like the Magellanic Bridge (Ra-
machandran et al. 2021), where the chance of escape may
be larger than in brighter central objects. Two candidates re-
ported by Saxena et al. (2022) were not detected in the rest-
frame LyC in F336W, which is somewhat bluer than the LyC
ﬁlter of these authors. We speculate that this might be ex-
plained by the fact that these authors use a ﬁlter for LyC
which is narrower and slightly redder than F336W, placing it
closer to the Lyman edge, where it could conceivably detect
a rest-frame ∼ 850 Å signal, while the rest-frame ∼ 750–
800Å signal which would be observed in F336W could get
absorbed by the IGM.

3. We ﬁnd very high relative escape fractions in all candidate
galaxies, up to ∼ 450% after IGM correction, and likely sub-
stantially more if correcting by a more realistic dust model.
Such values are tempting to dismiss as unphysical. However,
all found leaker candidates have absolute escape fractions
consistent with unity; the high relative escape fractions are
due to correction for the dust cover inferred from the SED
ﬁts of the general stellar population, based on the assump-
tion that the LyC leaking stars are seen through a dust layer
identical to that covering the general stellar population. Dust
is often distributed highly unevenly in starburst galaxies, and
their LyC output may be dominated by a small number of
very bright stars, suggesting that these can indeed be seen
through channels of lower dust content, perhaps practically
zero. This calls for caution when interpreting the relative es-
cape fractions often reported in the literature.

4. We ﬁnd that for some of our candidate objects, the stars con-
tributing the bulk of LyC photons must be subject to sub-
stantially lower dust attenuation than the stellar population
dominating at rest-frame 1500 Å. We have argued that this
could be a believable scenario based on the strong patchiness
of dust found in studies of local-Universe starburst galaxies;
on previous ﬁndings that a very small number of stars can
dominate the ionizing output of a galaxy, and that our selec-
tion criteria have favored just such a scenario strongly. We
argue that this can have consequences for estimates of cos-
mic ionizing emissivity based on estimates of relative escape
fractions.

5. We have computed a value of the cosmic ionizing emissivity
of log10((cid:15)ν)= 25.32+0.25
−0.21 assuming all our candidates are bona
ﬁde LyC leakers, and 25.29+0.27
−0.22 assuming only the tier 1 can-
didates are real leakers. We have based these numbers on the
assumption that IGM lines of sight which lead to fesc,abs ≤
100% are valid basis for Monte Carlo sampling of the IGM.

6. The derived contribution log10((cid:15)ν) to the metagalactic ioniz-
ing background made by these galaxies is consistent with the
values found from indirect measurements of the ionization
state of the IGM done by Becker & Bolton (2013) without
invoking bright quasars. It is also consistent with the values
found for the redshift range 2.35 < z < 3.05 found by Jones
et al. (2021). Our ﬁndings thus support the claim that star for-
mation can indeed produce the amount of ionizing photons
necessary to account for the ionization degree of the IGM
during the epoch of Cosmic Noon.

Comparison with studies using widely adopted candidate
preselection methods shows that the method in this work com-
plements the methods using preselection: It can identify can-
didates that are otherwise overlooked by these methods, but
can also miss candidates found by other methods. We therefore
recommend the community that searches based on the general
method of this work be carried out in the other large Hubble
legacy ﬁelds such as the wider CANDELS ﬁelds.

Figs. A.1 and A.2 show examples of some of the challenges
associated with background subtraction in UV and optical/red
bands. Both show in panel (1) the PSF-matched data including
the background, in panel (2) the modeled background, in panel
(3) the background subtracted data, and in panel (4) the uncer-
tainties on the background. Fig. A.1 shows these for the F225W
observations. The image in (1) is characterized by few and rel-
atively faint sources and a highly structured background, with
stripes and spatial variations in the level. The background levels
are numerically comparable to the ﬂux in many of the fainter ob-
jects, and to achieve reliable photometric results, it is necessary
to model and subtract this structure, without modeling and sub-
tracting any actual sources. The modeling is detailed in sect. 3.2.

Fig. A.2 shows the same process, but for the F775W ﬁlter.
Here, sources are more numerous and much brighter in compar-
ison with the background. Additionally, giant elliptical galaxies
with their old, red and UV-faint stellar populations are becoming
visible in these bands. These galaxies have a substantially larger
extent than the UV sources in F225W above, meaning that to
avoid modeling and subtracting them, either a larger kernel or
wider masks around detected sources are necessary. But these
masks cannot be too wide, either, as the large number of small
and faint sources in the ﬁeld would leave very few pixels with
which to model the background.

Panel (2) in ﬁg. A.2 shows one such giant elliptical which has
not been entirely masked out, such that the low surface bright-
ness outer parts have been modeled and subtracted. This was the
best compromise we could ﬁnd between masking and leaving
pixels to model without resorting to manual masking. We have
checked if any of our sources are aﬀected by this (weak) eﬀect,
which was not the case.

settings

Appendix B.1: Source detection settings

For each of the UV ﬁlters F225W, F275W and F336W, we
ran the photutils source detection function detect_sources
with a set of parameters selected to ﬁnd all sources above a set
of threshold values of signal-to-noise, Due to the comparatively
low SNR in the UV ﬁlters, and the blotchy noise patterns de-
scribed above, it can be diﬃcult to distinguish spurious detec-
tions from real sources in each individual detection ﬁlter. At later
steps, however, we have imaging data in up to 10 additional ﬁl-
ters available, meaning that we have opted for a set of very per-
missible source ﬁnding and detection settings, deliberately re-
sulting in a large number of spurious detections which we then
subsequently reject using the additional information provided by
the additional data. In order to not miss any real but faint ob-
jects, we deliberately selected the detection parameters to allow
for spurious detections. These could then be ﬁltered out in subse-
quent steps based on optical and IR photometry in the segmen-
tation maps. We found a set of suitable parameters for source
detection and deblending by trial and error, eventually settling
on the values tabulated in Table B.1.

Appendix B.2: Deblending

In deblending autodetected sources, one must strike a balance
between on one hand separating truly distinct sources, while on
the other hand correctly identifying substructure within a galaxy
as such. The main purpose of deblending in the context of this
work has been to correctly identify as many sources as possi-
ble at redshifts 2-4. We have therefore, as with source detec-
tion, pursued a quite aggressive deblending strategy, where cor-
rectly identifying unresolved or barely resolved but potentially
overlapping sources took priority. This resulted in a number of
clumps in large spirals identiﬁed as separate sources, but these
were easily identiﬁed and rejected at later steps (see Sect. 3.5,
especially 3.5.3).

A diﬀerent challenge was posed by the blotchy pattern de-
scribed in sect. 3.2. These patterns are sometimes diﬃcult to tell
apart from lower surface brightness extended features, and thus
a balance needed to be found between on one side recovering all
ﬂux from true physical sources, while on the other hand avoiding
to include too extended blotches in the segmentation maps.

Parameters for source detection and deblending were set in a
process of trial and error, and the ﬁnal choices are presented in
Table B.1.

In table B.1 we tabulate parameters passed to the photutils
functions detect_sources and deblend_sources. Most are
identical for the three ﬁlters but listed for completeness and easy
access. The process is described in sect. B.2. FWHM is the width
in pixels of the Gaussian convolution kernel used for deblending;
npixels is the minimum number of consecutive pixels required to
be above the threshold SNR. Nlevels and contrast are explained
in the photutils documentation.

Appendix B.3: How many spurious detections?

When detecting sources, we have deliberately set the detection
criteria to be permissive, allowing for a relatively large num-
ber of spurious detection and relying on later ﬁltering steps to
discern these from real objects. This of course raises a con-
cern regarding how eﬀective these ﬁltering steps are. With suﬃ-

ciently many spurious detections present, the probability grows
that some of these might by slip through the ﬁltering mecha-
nisms set up to catch them.

We tested the magnitude of this problem by inverting the
sign of the pixels in the background-subtracted F225W detec-
tion frame, and running the source detection routine with the ex-
act same settings as before. By giving all true sources negative
ﬂux, we ensured that all detections were due to noise. We then
proceeded as previously, by extracting ﬂux from the neighboring
ﬁlter on the red side, in this case F275W, in the segments created
by the detection routine, and comparing colors and SNR as de-
scribed for the science frames above, to test how large a fraction
of the initial detections made it past these ﬁltering criteria.

In the inverted F225W frame, we found 2317 “sources” liv-
ing up to our detection criteria. After extracting the correspond-
ing ﬂuxes in F275W and comparing SNR and demanding that
the AB magnitude be larger in the bluer band, we found that 18
of these sources still remained. We then tested these against the

R15 and I17 catalogs with the same angular distance requirement
of 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 75 as above; 5 of the 18 sources still remaining fell inside
this radius of a catalog object, yielding a spurious detection rate
of 5/2317, or 0.2%, before visual inspection.

Appendix C: UV ﬁlter error estimates

We ran the source detection routines in all the three UV ﬁlters.
For each of these, we measured ﬂuxes for every segment in the
resulting segmentation ﬁlters in all 11 available ﬁlters. Visual
inspection of a number of sources made us suspect that the errors
in the UV ﬁlters were over estimated, which we conﬁrmed by
running Monte Carlo sampling, as described in the main text.

In ﬁg. C.1, we show as an example the originally measured
and the re-estimated ﬂux errors from the catalog detected using
F275W. Objects with source sums (cid:46) 10-3, and typical SNR of ∼
1, are spurious detections in F275W and are ﬁltered out of our
sample at the next step.

At the lowest ﬂuxes, the errors are overestimated by a factor
of ∼ 5–6. For brighter objects, this diﬀerence declines until the
re-estimated errors become higher than those based on the RMS
map.

Appendix D: Rest-frame ﬁlter wavelength coverage

In Table D.1, we show the restframe wavelength coverage of
each UV ﬁlter at the redshifts of each of the seven candidates.
We are quoting the wavelengths from 1%–99% of the integrated

ture is an artifact of the PSF matching process.

Appendix E: Artifact in PSF matched F336W image

Our source detection picked up an apparent feature in F336W
∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48) from F336W-1041. The feature is oﬀset from the I17
and R15 catalog coordinates of the companion galaxy and, as
is visible in ﬁg. E.1, also from the ﬂux centroid in the opti-
cal frames (here F775W). We inspected the non-PSF matched
archival frame as found in MAST and found that there was no

To test whether the measured ionizing ﬂux in 1041 could
likewise be an artifact, we extracted the ﬂux from a circular aper-
ture matching the one used above and measured the ﬂux and un-
certainty. The values we recovered for both ﬂux and uncertainty
were consistent with the ones previously found, and its centroid
in F336W coincident with that in the optical ﬁlters, so we con-
clude that this feature was real.
