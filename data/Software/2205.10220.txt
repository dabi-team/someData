ABSTRACT 

This paper explicates the concept of an ‘Intermediate Point’ (IP), its incorporation as a node 

along an interplanetary trajectory, and how it permits the determination and optimization of 

trajectories to interstellar objects (ISOs). IPs can be used to model Solar Oberth Manoeuvres 

(SOM) as well as V∞ Leveraging Manoeuvres (VLM). The SOM has been established 

theoretically as an important mechanism by which rapid exit from the solar system and intercept 

of ISOs can both be achieved; the VLM has been demonstrated practically as a method of 

reducing overall mission ΔV as well as the Characteristic Energy, C3, at launch. Thus via these 

two applications, the feasibility of missions to interstellar objects (ISOs) such as 1I/’Oumuamua 

can be analysed. The interplanetary trajectory optimizer tool exploited for this analysis, OITS, 

permits IP selection as an encounter option along the interplanetary trajectory in question. OITS 

adopts the assumption of impulsive thrust at discrete points along the trajectory, an assumption 

which is generally valid for high thrust propulsion scenarios, like chemical or nuclear thermal for 

instance.

Intermediate Points for Missions to Interstellar Objects Using Optimum Interplanetary 

Trajectory Software 

1.)  Introduction 

For humanity the realisation of travel to the stars beyond our own is confounded by a 

combination of their enormous distances and the theoretical constraint on the speed of the 

spacecraft, the speed of light, c. Thus the nearest star to our own, Proxima Centauri at 4.2 light 

years, would take tens of thousands of years using present day chemical propulsion technology.  

However the arrival and discovery of interstellar objects (ISOs), interlopers to our solar 

system originating from elsewhere in our galaxy, has conveniently saved us the trouble of such 

prolonged journey times – material from other systems has arrived on our door-step for us to 

study if we so desire.  

Since 1I/‘Oumuamua [1], was discovered on an unquestionably hyperbolic orbit, i.e. with 

e = 1.2 ( > 1), the possibility of flyby or rendezvous missions have been the subject of 

speculation and debate. With their significant heliocentric hyperbolic excess speeds (for 

‘Oumuamua V∞ > 26.3kms-1), the problem of the feasibility of spacecraft missions to ISOs after 

they have passed beyond their perihelia and are leaving the solar system, has been debated by 

scientists [2,3]. The resolution of this problem is no longer a matter for conjecture, it can be 

quantified by the application of the necessary software tool, for example Optimum Interplanetary 

Trajectory Software (OITS) [4].  OITS was originally developed for the express purpose of 

investigation of missions to objects belonging to our own solar system, hence ‘interplanetary’. 

Upon the discovery of ‘Oumuamua with all its unique characteristics, OITS was adapted with 

some minor alterations to allow exploration of intercept trajectories to this ISO [5,6,7,8]. With 

 
 
 
 
the subsequent detection in 2019 of the second ISO, 2I/Borisov, further research was conducted 

into missions to this object [9]. 

The key facility within OITS allowing investigations of this kind is the ‘Intermediate 

Point’ (IP), which can be chosen by the user as an alternative to a planetary encounter and 

enables the user to incorporate what is known as a ‘Solar Oberth Manoeuvre’ (SOM) along the 

interplanetary trajectory. To elucidate, a SOM is a mechanism by which a high exit speed out of 

the solar system can be generated whilst utilizing a minimum magnitude ΔV applied by the 

spacecraft propulsion system [10,11].   

A further application for the IP, not necessarily confined to ISO missions, is the modelling of ‘V∞ 

Leveraging Manoeuvres’ (VLM) which reduces the total ΔV needed to arrive at the target which 

might be an outer planet, for example [12]. 

2.)  Basic Theory 

We have Nbody celestial bodies in sequence, P1, P2, P3…PNbody. We can associate with 

these bodies Nbody times, t1, t2, t3…tNbody. By using the NASA Horizons service in conjunction 

with the NASA SPICE toolkit, extremely accurate positions, ri  i=1…Nbody, for all these objects 

can be derived as a function of time. If we assume the sun is the only gravitating body acting on 

the spacecraft, then for two bodies, let’s say P1 and P2 at times t1 and t2 respectively, the Lambert 

problem [13] can be solved to allow computation of two interplanetary trajectories from P1 to P2, 

short way, ‘sw’, and long way, ‘lw’, with the necessary endpoint times and positions being 

respected. 

2.1) Universal Variable Formulation 

The technique employed is the ‘Universal Variable Formulation’ [13]. OITS does not 

seek solutions involving multiple orbital revolutions, which restricts the solution to two possible 

transfer orbits. The equations are provided below: 

 
 
 
Δ𝜃 = acos⁡ (

Note that μ is the gravitational mass of the sun. The above three equations (4)-(6) are solved for x, 

y, z, where t = t2 - t1, r1, r2 are the knowns (Δν, Δθ, A being functions of these) and x, y, z are the 

unknowns.  

Having solved for x, y, z, the following equations allow the heliocentric departure 

velocity at P1, VD and arrival velocity at P2 VA of the interplanetary trajectory to be calculated:

This process can be repeated for all trajectories (swj, lwj) j=1…Nbody-1.  

2.2) Solution for Two Bodies – Home and Target 

With Nbody=2, and the addition of an equation to give the gradient dt/dz, the above can be 

solved using a Newton iteration. Two ΔVs can then be computed depending on whether the 

trajectory is along the short way (Δν = Δθ) or long way (Δν = 2π - Δθ) Furthermore for both 

routes there will be two possible alternative values of ΔV, depending on whether it is a flyby 

mission or a rendezvous mission: 

Δ𝑉𝑘 = ⁡ |𝑽𝑫𝒌 − 𝑽𝟏| 

flyby 

Δ𝑉𝑘 = ⁡ |𝑽𝑫𝒌 − 𝑽𝟏| + ⁡ |𝑽𝑨𝒌 − 𝑽𝟐| 

rendezvous 

Where k =1 or 2 so that: 

Δ𝜈 = ⁡Δ𝜃,⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑘 = 1 

Δ𝜈 = 2𝜋 − ⁡Δ𝜃,⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑘 = 2

Note V1 and V2 are the velocities of the home and arrival celestial bodies respectively. 

 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3)  Solutions for Nbody > 2 

For Nbody>2 bodies then there are Ntrans=Nbody-1 connecting interplanetary transfer 

trajectories, each with a lw and a sw, corresponding to N=2Ntrans permutations.  Each of these 

Ntrans transfer trajectories can be solved in the same manner explained in Section 2.2.  

As an example let us assume Nbody=4 and therefore there are two terminal planets P1 & P4 and  

also NP=23=8 possible permutations of trajectory, connecting P1, P2, P3 & P4 at times t1, t2, t3 & 

t4. The situation is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.

Focusing on a non-terminal Planet Pi, we can see there are four possible alternative encounter 

trajectories that the spacecraft may travel along as it encounters the planet. Let us take one 

possible arrival and departure velocity, given by  

𝑽𝑨𝒊−𝟏,𝒌𝟏⁡&⁡𝑽𝑫𝒊,𝒌𝟐⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡ 

where⁡2⁡ ≤ ⁡⁡𝑖⁡ ≤ ⁡𝑁𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠⁡ 

𝑘1⁡ = ⁡1⁡𝑜𝑟⁡2⁡𝑎𝑛𝑑⁡𝑘2 = 1⁡𝑜𝑟⁡2. 

Furthermore the angle between them is given by: 

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼 = ⁡

𝑽𝑨𝒊−𝟏,𝒌𝟏.𝑽𝑫𝒊,𝒌𝟐
|𝑽𝑨𝒊−𝟏,𝒌𝟏|⁡|𝑽𝑫𝒊,𝒌𝟐|

(19) 

We now make the following assumptions: 

1)  that the hyperbolic excess velocities at arrival and departure of Pi are VAi-1,k1 and VDi,k2  

respectively 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
2)  that the encounter trajectory of the spacecraft w.r.t. Pi is entirely influenced by the 

gravitational attraction of Pi, and we ignore the influences of any other bodies, such as 

the sun (i.e. patched conic). 

3)  a velocity increment of magnitude ΔV is applied in the plane containing VAi-1,k1 and 

VDi,k2   

4)  further that this ΔV is applied at the periapsis point w.r.t. Pi  

5)  This ΔV is directed tangential to the trajectory 

The above assumptions require two hyperbolas, Hyp and Hyp’ as shown in Figure 3 connected at 

the periapsis point. The situation can be encapsulated in the three simultaneous equations: 

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾 = −⁡

𝜇𝑖
(𝜇𝑖+⁡𝑟𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑉𝐴𝑖−1,𝑘1

2

)

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾′ = −⁡

𝜇𝑖
2 )
(𝜇𝑖+⁡𝑟𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑉𝐷𝑖,𝑘2

𝛼⁡ + ⁡𝜋 = 𝛾 + 𝛾′ 

(20) 

(21) 

(22) 

Where γ is the angle subtended at the centre of Pi between the direction of the hyperbolic arrival 

asymptote and the periapsis point; and γ’ is the angle subtended at the centre of Pi between the 

periapsis point and hyperbolic escape asymptote. In addition rper is the common periapsis where 

Hyp and Hyp’connect and μi is the gravitational mass of Pi. The three simultaneous equations 

(20)-(22) have three unknowns γ, γ’, rper. It can be shown that, solving for γ is a matter of finding 

the solution to the following equation: 

((𝑉𝐷𝑖,𝑘2

2 − 𝑉𝐴𝑖−1,𝑘1

2

)𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾 + 𝑉𝐷𝑖,𝑘2

2 ) 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝛼 − 𝛾) + ⁡ 𝑉𝐴𝑖−1,𝑘1

2

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾 = 0  

(23) 

A derivative of the function on the left hand side of (23) can be found enabling application of a 

Newton iteration to solve this equation. Having converged to the solution γ, then rper and ΔV can 

be computed. Furthermore inclination, i, argument of periapsis ω, and longitude of ascending 

 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
node, Ω, (all w.r.t. the Planet Pi) can be determined using the plane containing VAi-1,k1 and VDi,k2. 

Though the precise equations (20)-(23) are different to those in  [14,15], nevertheless the 

assumptions employed by this algorithm and the solutions found will be identical to those 

applied. 

This procedure outlined above can be performed on each non-terminal planet and there will be in 

total 2Ntrans permutations, each with a different combination of ΔVs and each with a different 

sum-total. Of all these sum-totals, the minimum is chosen. 

2.4)  General Formulation of Problem 

The general mathematical statement of the problem as follows. 

Given Nbody planets Pi, i=1…Nbody, each associated with a time ti, i=1…Nbody, we can 

generate the total ΔV (which will be the minimum of a total of 2Ntrans permutations) as a function 

of these times, as follows: 

Δ𝑉 = ⁡Φ(𝑡1, ⁡𝑡2, … . 𝑡𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦) 

(24) 

The algorithm to generate Φ is elucidated in Sections 2.1 to 2.3. 

Thus the problem is to minimize Φ whilst satisfying the following constraints: 

a)  The periapsis at each of the non-terminal encounters  should be greater than a user-

specifed distance RMIN’, thus 

′ 
𝑹𝑷𝑬𝑹𝒊 > ⁡ 𝑹𝑴𝑰𝑵𝒊

i=2…Ntrans 

(25) 

b)  Where applicable, the perihelion along the trajectory arc from i=1..Ntrans must be 

greater than a user-specified distance RPERIH’, thus

i=1…Ntrans 

(26) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The solution of finding the minimum of (24) subject to the constraints (25) & (26) amounts to a 

Non-Linear Programming (NLP) problem and for OITS two NLP tools were selected for solving 

this task, NOMAD [16] and MIDACO [17].

3.1) History 

3)  Intermediate Points 

With the arrival of the first definite interstellar object (ISO) 1I/‘Oumuamua in our solar 

system, the question arose as to whether the algorithm used by the OITS software (as expounded 

in Section 2) could be exploited to study the feasibility of missions. Under the Project Lyra 

initiative, inaugurated by the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is), the requirement for a ‘Solar 

Oberth’ Manoeuvre (SOM) [10] had already been identified. The reasoning behind this choice of 

a SOM was two-fold. Firstly ‘Oumuamua had been discovered significantly after perihelion,  

receding from the sun with considerable speed, necessitating a ‘catch-up’ approach. (The 

heliocentric hyperbolic excess speed of ‘Oumuamua is upwards of 26 kms-1, thus requiring a 

spacecraft speed of at least this value.) Secondly, with an extra layer of complexity, the 

inclination of ‘Oumuamua’s orbit is relatively high, resulting in a significant displacement from 

the ecliptic plane at intercept, a problem which nevertheless yields readily to the application of a 

SOM. However the OITS algorithm in its form at that time was insufficient for modelling a 

SOM, because encounter events along the trajectory were restricted to celestial bodies and 

corresponding binary SPICE kernel files retrieved from the NASA Horizons service. To 

overcome this limitation the notion of an ‘Intermediate Point’ was conceived and then applied as 

an additional functionality to the software.

Figure 4 Definition of Intermediate Point 

An Intermediate Point (IP) is a user-specified distance from the centre of the solar system. 

This can be selected instead of a celestial body as an encounter option in the user-specified 

sequence. Figure 4 is a diagram showing the definition of an IP. 

The values of the polar angles λ and φ for the IP under consideration are included with the times 

ti, i=1…Nbody as parameters to be optimized by the NLP tool applied (refer Section 2.4). Thus 

for one IP along the trajectory equation 24 can be rewritten: 

Δ𝑉 = ⁡Φ(𝑡1, ⁡𝑡2, … . 𝑡𝑁𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦, 𝜆, 𝜑)   

(27) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
It is now a question of finding the minimum of function Φ, subject to user-specified limits on ti 

and also -π ≤ λ ≤ π and -π/2 ≤ φ ≤ π/2. 

3.3) Using an Intermediate Point to Model a Solar Oberth Manoeuvre 

For a typical mission scenario to 1I/’Oumuamua, the sequence E-J-IP-1I might be applied. 

This abbreviation indicates a launch from Earth (E), an encounter with Jupiter (J), an 

Intermediate Point (IP), and finally arrival at ‘Oumuamua (1I). The distance from the sun’s 

centre for the IP might then be chosen as 0.01395 au (equivalent to 3 Solar Radii). In addition, 

two minimum perihelia constraints are also necessary. The situation is illustrated in Figure 5 & 

Figure 6.

In Figure 6 we see the result of application of a minimum perihelia constraint on both the 

trajectory leading to the IP and that leaving the IP. This compels the IP to be a perihelion point, 

as required of a SOM. 

3.4) Using an Intermediate Point to Model a V∞ Leveraging Manoeuvre 

For an interplanetary mission, a VLM [12] is a means by which the hyperbolic excess 

speed (V∞) with respect to a planet P can be amplified by conducting a Deep Space Manoeuvre 

(DSM) and then returning to the planet P for a gravity assist. By so doing, a considerable 

reduction in ΔV along the trajectory can be achieved enabling access to the outer planets, Jupiter 

for example, with less fuel mass. The return to P is accomplished after approximately, but not 

exactly, a time lapse of n cycles of P, i.e. nT. For example if the planet P is Earth, then the time 

elapsed will be approximately n * 365.25 days where n = 1, 2, or 3 etc. 

 
 
 
 
 
It is emphasized that this elapsed time must be either side of nT, as theoretically there is no 

benefit from the situation where it is exactly nT. To elaborate, there are two alternative scenarios, 

i.e. n- and n+, the former when the return to P is slightly sooner than nT and the latter when it is 

slightly later than nT.  Thus the interplanetary trajectory which can be abbreviated to P-DSM-P 

can be considered as resonant with the orbit of P. 

A VLM can be modelled by incorporating an IP in between two successive encounters of 

the planet in question. The value of R specified for the IP can be derived as follows. 

Let us consider a Leveraging at a resonance n with the orbit of P, this planet having a time period 

TP. By Kepler’s third law and Newton’s law of gravitation, we have for the (approximately) 

elliptical leg of the journey P-DSM-P: 

𝑛𝑇𝑝 = 2𝜋. √

𝑎3
𝜇

(28) 

Where a is the semi-major axis of the interplanetary trajectory P-DSM-P. 

Rearranging we have: 

3
𝑎 = √𝜇 (

2
)

𝑛𝑇𝑝
2𝜋

(29) 

Now along P-DSM-P, the spacecraft perihelion will be at RP and the aphelion will be at RDSM. 

Thus we have the following relationship: 

𝑅𝑝 + ⁡ 𝑅𝐷𝑆𝑀 = 2𝑎 

(30) 

We know a from equation (29) and also RP, thus we can calculate the radial distance required of 

the IP/DSM as follows: 

𝑅𝐷𝑆𝑀 = 2𝑎 − ⁡ 𝑅𝑝 

(31)

4)  Results of Investigations into ISO Missions which Use both SOMs and VLMs 

The feasibility of missions to the ISO 1I/’Oumuamua was investigated through the 

‘Project Lyra’ initiative. The KISS study [10] had already expounded a method of generating 

high heliocentric hyperbolic excess speeds into the interstellar medium (ISM), by utilising a 

SOM, and this was selected as a key trajectory option for Project Lyra research. Further in [10], 

an Earth VLM, with a 3 year resonance, was introduced to reduce the overall velocity increment 

ΔV and the magnitude of C3 required at Earth by the selected launch system. Refer to Table 3  

which provides results (with the IPs highlighted) of a solution by OITS for what shall be 

identified here as the Project Lyra Mission 1 scenario. Further analysis reveals that this C3 and 

total ΔV increment combination can be achieved in practice, with significant payload masses, by 

a NASA Space Launch System. 

As a consequence of the findings of the Interstellar Probe Concept Report [18], which detailed 

the results of a study into spacecraft missions to the ISM, Project Lyra shifted its attention from a 

Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, to a Jupiter Oberth Manoeuvre (JOM). This was because[18] 

effectively ditches the SOM in favour of either (a) a Passive Jupiter Gravitational Assist, or (b) a 

JOM.  

However much one might argue the pros and cons of this decision, nevertheless it seemed 

pertinent to consider the JOM as an option for Project Lyra as it is does not have the additional 

challenges of a close approach to the sun (and consequent heat shield) and low technical 

readiness. Thus refer to Table 4 and Figure 10 for Project Lyra Mission 2 scenario. A VLM is 

inserted between the first return to Earth and the second, with a 2 year Earth resonance. Mission 

2 is the same VEEGA sequence to Jupiter as [19].

5)  Conclusions 

The simplicity of the concept of the Intermediate Point belies its flexibility and utility, 

allowing solutions of interplanetary missions with specified V∞ Leveraging Manoeuvres for any 

chosen planet (in particular, Earth and Venus), as long as the corresponding calculation of 

aphelion distance for the Deep Space Manoeuvre is performed. Solar Oberth Manoeuvres can 

also be modelled using IPs, and rapid optimal trajectory solutions to ISOs can be generated 

allowing in-depth analysis of mission feasibility. A feature not expounded in this paper is the 

capability of studying missions to distant ‘virtual’ objects belonging to our solar system, where 

the heliocentric distance to the object can be specified by an IP, and in addition the heliocentric 

longitude and latitude can be set as fixed parameters.
