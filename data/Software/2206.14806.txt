ABSTRACT

Studies on the circumstellar structures around evolved stars provide vital information on the evolution of the parent
star and the properties of the local interstellar medium. In this work, we present the discovery and characterization
of an optical cocoon tail behind the star HD 185806.

The cocoon apex emission is puzzling, as it is detected in the infrared but shows no signal in the optical wavelength.
The Hα and [O iii] ﬂuxes of the nebular structure vary from 2.7 to 8.5×10−12 erg s−1 cm−2 and from 0.9 to 7.0×10−13
erg s−1 cm−2, respectively. Through high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive the spectral type of the star, construct
the position-velocity diagrams of the cocoon tail for the Hα, [O iii] and [N ii] emission lines, and determine its velocity
in the range of −100 to 40 km s−1. Furthermore, we use SED ﬁtting and MESA evolutionary models adopting a
distance of 900 pc, and classify HD 185806 as a 1.3 M(cid:12) star, in the transition phase between the RGB and early AGB
stages. Finally, we study the morpho-kinematic structure of the cocoon tail using the astronomical software SHAPE.
An ellipsoidal structure, with an inclination of ∼ 19◦ with respect to the plane of sky is found to better reproduce
the observed cocoon tail of HD 185806.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several kinds of stars throughout the Hertzsprung-Russell
(HR) diagram are characterized by intense mass outﬂows in
the form of stellar winds. These winds drive gas and dust
into the interstellar medium (ISM) and shape extended cir-
cumstellar structures around the parent star (Langer 2012;
Smith 2014). Detailed studies of these circumstellar struc-
tures provide crucial insights on the nature and evolution of
the mass-losing star, the properties of the local ISM and help
us determine the impact of stellar outﬂows on the chemical
and dynamical evolution of their host galaxies.

Wind shaped circumstellar bubbles have been found to dis-
play a variety of morphologies that deviate from the spher-

lobes, blobs, jets, hydrodynamical

ical symmetry being elliptical, bipolar, multipolar and re-
vealing arcs,
instabili-
ties. Binary interactions (De Marco 2009; van Marle et al.
2012; Staﬀ et al. 2016; Decin 2019), magnetic ﬁeld activity
(Garcia-Segura 1997; García-Segura et al. 2005), stellar rota-
tion (Hoefner et al. 1996; García-Segura et al. 1999, 2016) are
only some of the drivers of the morphologies formed around
mass-losing stars. In addition, facts related to the ambient
medium such as density gradients/discontinuities, magnetic
ﬁelds, surrounding knots and clouds, pre-existing circumstel-
lar structures etc., further contribute on the ﬁnal outcome of
the resulted circumstellar structures (e.g. Dwarkadas et al.
1996; Raga et al. 1998; Wareing et al. 2007; Esquivel et al.
2010; van Marle et al. 2015).

In the case where the mass-losing star is moving super-
sonically, with respect to the local ambient medium, a bow-
shaped circumstellar structure is formed resulting by the bal-
ance of the wind’s material and the ISM’s ram pressures

(Comeron & Kaper 1998). Hence, bow-shaped wind struc-
tures are unique laboratories for determining or at least con-
straining the mass loss history of the central star, the sur-
rounding ISM density and ﬁnally the stellar systemic motion
(e.g. Huthoﬀ & Kaper 2002; Gvaramadze et al. 2014; Meyer
et al. 2014; Chiotellis et al. 2016; Meyer et al. 2016, 2020).

Two main mechanisms have been proposed to be responsi-
ble for the formation of circumstellar structures around su-
personically moving stars whose space velocities exceed the
30 km s−1 a value that roughly corresponds to three times
the typical stellar space velocity (e.g. Blaauw 1956; Gies &
Bolton 1986; Huthoﬀ & Kaper 2002). The ﬁrst mechanism
implies close dynamical interactions of either single stars
(Poveda et al. 1967), binary-binary interactions (Spitzer &
Varshalovich 1980) or ﬁnally by triple body encounter be-
tween a binary and a single star (Gvaramadze & Gualandris
2011) that occur in a dense stellar environment such as in
globular clusters. The second mechanism suggests that the
fast moving star is a member of a binary system, which re-
mained bound after the supernova explosion of the compan-
ion star (Zwicky 1957; Blaauw 1961). These two mechanisms
are more likely to occur in massive stars. Indeed, the vast
majority of bow shocks have been observed in massive OB
runaway stars. In these stars, the dust and gas are accumu-
lated behind the bow shock and are heated by the ultraviolet
radiation of the massive star (e.g. Henney & Arthur 2019).
Consequently, the dust radiates at the infrared band (Draine
& Lee 1984), while the shocked/photoionised gas produces
optical line emission, such as Hα and [O iii]. For this reason,
bow shocks are mostly detected in the mid-infrared (e.g. van
Buren et al. 1995; Noriega-Crespo et al. 1997; Peri et al. 2012,
2015; Kobulnicky et al. 2016, 2017) and -less frequently- in
the optical band (e.g. Gull & Soﬁa 1979; Kaper et al. 1997;
Brown & Bomans 2005; Boumis et al. 2009). In a few cases,
non-thermal emission of bow shocks has also been detected
in the radio (syncrotron) and X-ray (inverse Compton) bands
(e.g. BD+43o3654, AE Aurigal; Benaglia et al. 2010; López-
Santiago et al. 2012, respectively).

In the low stellar mass regime, nebular structures are
mostly observed around stars in the red giant branch (RGB)
and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) as during this phase
substantial mass outﬂows are met (e.g. Wenger et al. 2000;
Weigelt et al. 2002; Schöier et al. 2006; Castro-Carrizo et al.
2010; Olofsson et al. 2010; Ali et al. 2013; Silva Aguirre et al.
2020). Most of these bow shocks have been detected in the
mid-infrared band. A large Herschel/PACS survey of circum-
stellar structures around AGB stars revealed that bow shocks
are a common feature met in about 40% of the sample (Cox
et al. 2012). The stagnation point -i.e. nearest distance be-
tween the central star and the circumstellar structure- was
found to be smaller than 1 pc in all cases. Such a result
agrees with the mass loss history expected from AGB stars,
adopting typical Galactic warm neutral and ionised gas prop-
erties.

This paper focuses on the circumstellar structure around
the M-type, long period variable star (Kukarkin et al. 1970;
Kato 1999; Alfonso-Garzón et al. 2012) at the constellation
of Aquila, HD 185806 also known as V1279 Aql. This star
had been observed with the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Ex-
plorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) and displays a peculiar
circumstellar structure that resembles a "tail" feature. How-
ever no further investigation has been conducted to identify

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2022)

the nature of the star or the properties of the surrounding
nebula.

In this work, we present the discovery of an optical cocoon
tail behind of HD 185806. We obtain narrow band imaging in
several ﬁlters and high resolution optical spectroscopy, carry-
ing out the ﬁrst morpho-kinematic analysis of this cocoon tail
in the optical regime. The paper is structured as follows: In
Section 2, we present the optical images and high dispersion
spectra of the cocoon tail of HD 185806. The photometric
and spectroscopic results of our analysis are shown in Sec-
tion 3. An extended discussion regarding the properties of
the star and its coccoon-tail, as well as, a 3D morphokine-
matical model of the circumstellar structure are presented in
Section 4. We end with our conclusions in Section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 High-resolution imaging

Wide-ﬁeld optical images of HD 185806 and its neighbor-
hood were obtained with the 2.3m Aristarchos telescope at
Helmos Observatory in Greece in 2014. The whole cocoon
was imaged with four 5×5 arcmin2 pointings. A CCD detec-
tor with 1024×1024 pixels2 with 24µm pixel size, resulting
to 0.28 arcsec pixel−1 resolution, was used for the observa-
tions. Exposures of 1800 s duration were obtained through
the Hα, Hα+[N ii] and [N ii] emission line ﬁlters on the main
cocoon area, while the full mosaic was taken only with the
[O iii] ﬁlter (Boumis et al. 2016). In the latter, all ﬁelds were
projected on to a common origin on the sky and were sub-
sequently combined to create the ﬁnal mosaic. The analysis
of the images was carried out using the standard IRAF rou-
tines for the bias subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding correction, bad
pixel and column masking, sky background estimation and
cosmic-rays cleaning. The ﬂux and astrometric calibration
for all data frames was performed using the STScI Guide
Star Catalogue II (Lasker et al. 2008). We performed pho-
tometry of all sources appearing in the images although we
were mainly focused on HD 185806. This was done in order to
calibrate the magnitude and ﬂux of the star based on a stan-
dard zero point and have a larger sample of stars to estimate
the photometric errors. The photometric signal to noise ratio
(S/N) of our images was S/N>15 and the chi square value
χ2 ∼2.0.

The resulting mosaic of the [O iii] image, where HD 185806
and the whole cocoon tail can be seen is in Fig. 1, while in
Fig. 2 we show the comparison between the [O iii] and the Hα
emission line images. The Hα+[N ii] and [N ii] images are not
shown here, since the Hα+[N ii] and Hα images are almost
identical, with only a very few small regions of diﬀerence,
where there is faint [N ii] emission.

2.2 High-dispersion and high resolution long-slit

spectroscopy

High-dispersion long-slit echelle spectra were obtained at the
2.1 m telescope in the Observatorio Astronómico of San Pedro
Martir in Baja California, Mexico, in its f/7.5 conﬁguration
using the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer (Meaburn et al.
2003). The observations were carried out on 2014 November
27 and 29 (Table 1).

A 300 µm (≡ 3.9 arcsec and 20 km s−1) wide slit was used,
orientated at position angles of 30◦ and 57◦. The 512 incre-
ments of the 2×2 binned SITE CCD detector, each 0.624
arcsec long, give a total projected slit length of 5.32 arcmin
on the sky. In this spectroscopic mode MES–SPM has no
cross–dispersion consequently, for the present observations, a
ﬁlter of 90-Å bandwidth was used to isolate the 87th echelle
order containing the Hα and [N ii] 6548, 6584 Å nebular emis-
sion lines, and a ﬁlter of 60-Å bandwidth to isolate the 114th
echelle order containing the [O iii] line. Integrations of 1800 s
were obtained respectively for slit positions 1 and 2 marked
in Fig. 3. The position–velocity (pv) arrays of Hα, [N ii] and
[O iii] line proﬁles from slit positions 1 and 2 are shown in
Fig. 4.

We conducted similar pre-processing steps as for the im-
ages such as bias subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding and illumination
correction, cosmic-ray cleaning and background subtraction.
The background subtraction in our case was conducted with
extreme caution as over-subtraction of the background in ﬁl-
ters with fainter emission would lead to erroneous assump-
tions about the spectral features of the bow shock structure.
For the wavelength calibration of the spectra the Th-Ar arc-
lamp (Meaburn et al. 2003) was used.

We additionally collected a high resolution spectrum of
HD 185806 with the high-resolution ﬁbre-fed HERMES spec-
trograph mounted on the 1.2-m Mercator Telescope at the
Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma (Canary
Islands; Raskin et al. 2011). HERMES spectra have a spec-
tral resolution of R = 85 000 and a wavelength cover-
age 380–900 nm. The spectrum was automatically reduced
through a dedicated pipeline at the end of the observing
night. The observations were obtained in the V band with a
signal-to-noise ratio of 100 to ensure the accurate determina-
tion of the stellar parameters and of the chemical abundances.
A summary and log of our imaging and spectral observations
is provided in Table 1.

from 2.7 to 3.1×10−12 erg s−1 cm−2. For comparison, the
[O iii] and Hα emission of the nebula is shown in Fig. 2.
The nebula is evident in Hα displaying the same struc-
ture as in [O iii], however all ﬁlaments are fainter at this
wavelength. The bright ﬁlaments have Hα ﬂuxes between 3.5
and 7.0×10−13 erg s−1 cm−2 and the fainter ones between
8.5×10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 and 1.5×10−13 erg s−1 cm−2. The
[O iii]/Hα ﬂux ratio of the nebula is in the range from 10 to
30 being higher in the fainter ﬁlaments.

It is interesting to note that the emission is stronger in the
opposite outer sides of the cocoon (areas A, C and D of Fig. 3
) between α ’ 19h40m45s, δ ’ 02◦3103000; α ’ 19h40m47s,
δ ’ 02◦3101000 and α ’ 19h40m40s, δ ’ 02◦3000000; α ’
19h40m44s, δ ’ 02◦2902500. There are also two bright ﬁl-
aments almost perpendicular to the outer ones at α ’
19h40m46s, δ ’ 02◦3001500 (close to area B) and around α ’
19h40m42s, δ ’ 02◦3003000 (close to area E). On the contrary,
both the bow-shock and the cocoon tail regions opposite to
the star have either faint or no obvious emission.

3.2 High-resolution spectra of the optical cocoon

tail around HD 185806

The full mosaic of HD 185806 with the cocoon tail surround-
ing it, is shown in Fig. 3. The slit positions are indicated in
red color while the regions where the heliocentric velocity of
the gas was derived (Table 2) are labeled as A, B, C, D, E,
and F. Figure 4 shows the position velocity (PV) diagrams
in the corresponding emission lines for slit 1 (S1) (top two
panels) and slit 2 (S2) (lower three panels). A general result
is that in all positions and in both slits, the whole structure
of the cocoon reveals a bulk velocity towards us. Further-
more, at the same emission lines, there is a good agreement
in velocities in positions from the same or nearby ﬁlaments,
as it is for A and D, B and E, C and F. In Table 2, we also

list the minimum and maximum velocities measured in each
emission line, where it can be seen that the Hα ranges from
−100 to 40 km s−1, the [N ii] from −80 to 35 km s−1 and the
[O iii] from −90 to 15 km s−1.

It is also noticeable in the PV diagrams that the Hα and
[O iii] emissions are detected all over the cocoon area, while in
the [N ii] emission are detected only some bright spots (A/C
and D/F for the S1 and S2 slit positions). The detection of
the Hα, [N ii], and [O iii] emission lines in the cocoon tail
of HD 185806 in conjunction with the low temperature of
the star implies the presence of a shock-heated gas. If the
orientation of the cocoon is taken into account, the expansion
velocity of the ionized gas would be > 70-80 km s−1 which can
explain the strong [O iii] emission. However, follow-up low-

dispersion spectroscopic data are required in order to provide
insights on the physical conditions of the gas.

3.3 High-resolution spectrum of HD 185806

The high resolution spectrum from HERMES yielded that
HD 185806 is an M4-type, long period variable star. We es-
timated the atomic abundances following the same method
as described in Shetye et al. (2018). The spectra of S and M
stars are dominated by molecular bands making the detec-
tion of unblended atomic s-process lines quite rare (Smith &
Lambert 1990). This is why a spectral-synthesis approach is
required, as opposed to relying solely on equivalent widths.

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2022)

In order to check whether the star is undergoing active slow
neutron capture nucleosynthesis (s-process), which is typical
in thermally-pulsing AGB stars, we checked for any presence
of Technetium (Tc). Tc is an s-process element with no stable
isotope. One of the isotopes 99Tc of the star has a half-life of
210 000 yrs. This peculiar property of Tc makes it the best
indicator for any active s-process nucleosynthesis in S and M
type stars (Shetye et al. 2018). We checked the three Tc I
lines located at 4239.191 Å, 4267.27 Å and 4297.06 Å, and
did not detect any absorption of Tc. We conclude that HD
185806 is not a thermally-pulsing AGB star. As in Shetye
et al. (2018), we used the two Zr lines at 7819.37 Å and
7849.37 Å with transition probabilities from laboratory mea-

surements (Biemont et al. 1981). In the case of HD 185806
we do not report any overabundance of Zr, conﬁrming that
the star does not show any enrichment of s-process elements.
We derived the [Fe/H] using some Fe lines at [Fe/H]= -0.50
dex revealing the sub-solar metallicity of the star. We addi-
tionally derived the nitrogen abundance from the CN lines in
the 8000-8100 Årange. In particular, using the lines listed in
Merle et al. (2016). We report a nitrogen abundance [N/Fe]
= +0.6 to +1 dex. An illustration of the observed and syn-
thetic spectra obtained for HD 185806 around the Zr line at
7849.37 Å are shown in Fig. 5.

This optical/infrared discrepancy at the location of the
forward shock of the cocoon may partly originate from the
penetration of interstellar dust into the inner circumstellar
medium of HD 185806. This engenders a shift between the lo-
cation of the outer layer of the cocoon and the location where
the dust accumulates, as shown in van Marle et al. (2011) in
the context of the cool runaway red supergiant star Betel-
geuse. Finally, another deviation between the optical and in-
frared occurs at the edge of the cocoon tail, opposite to the
star, where the faint [O iii] ﬁlament is not accompanied by
IR emission.

3.4 WISE observations

4 DISCUSSION

HD 185806 and its cocoon tail have also been observed
with WISE. The stellar source is detected in all bands (W1
(3.4 µm), W2 (4.6 µm), W3 (12.1 µm), and W4 (22 µm)
(Wright et al. 2010) but it is saturated in the ﬁrst two. The
cocoon tail is detected only in the W4 band which indicates
the presence of warm dust. Fig. 6 shows the [O iii] image
with the contours from the W4 image over plotted in yel-
low. The contours surround both the star and the nebula,
as well as, the interior ﬁlaments of the nebula revealing a
strong correlation between the optical and infrared emission.
This correlation is not uncommon, since it has been found in
other cases, such as in Wolf-Rayet star nebulae (Toalá et al.
2015). The W4 image shows that the emission in this band
is dominated by thermal continuum emission from dust spa-
tially coincident with the thin nebular shell or most likely
with the leading edge of the nebula. Intriguingly, the bow
shock that is absent from the optical images of HD 185806,
is likely detected in the W4 band as it can be seen from the
outer contours (Fig. 6).

4.1 Properties and nature of HD 185806

Our spectroscopic analysis conﬁrmed that HD 185806 is an
M4-type long period variable star. Based on Gaia eDR3 we
estimated the distance of HD 185806 at D=909 pc (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018). The angular velocity of the
star is observed to be µ ∼ 10.2 mas yr−1 and for the given
distance corresponds to a transverse stellar velocity of VT =
43.75 km s−1. Finally, the Gaia eDR3 radial velocity value is
found to be Vr = 14.0 km s−1.

We used the photometric data available in virtual obser-
vatory spectral energy distribution (SED) analyzer (VOSA;
Bayo et al. 2008) to determine the eﬀective temperature
(Teﬀ) and luminosity (L) of the star. VOSA oﬀers tools for
the SED analysis, allowing the estimation of the stellar pa-
rameters. The synthetic photometry used by VOSA is cal-
culated by convolving the response curve of the used ﬁl-
ter set with the theoretical synthetic spectra. Then, a sta-
tistical test is performed, via χ2 minimization, to estimate

created the SED for HD 185806 and ﬁtted the data with
a library of high-resolution synthetic stellar spectra (Coelho
et al. 2005) created by the PFANT code (Cayrel et al. 1991;
Barbuy et al. 2018). The SED generated for a distance of
900 pc is shown in Fig. 7 and corresponds to Teﬀ= 3400±100

seem to be in well agreement with the spectra. The extracted
properties of HD 185806 are summarized in Table 3.

40 per cent of the critical breakup speed. Based on the spec-
tral type, eﬀective temperature, luminosity and [Fe/H], we
plotted evolutionary tracks of 1-3 M(cid:12) with steps of 0.1 M(cid:12),
using a Galactic extinction of AV =1.12 mag by NASA/IPAC

lutionary track which best ﬁts the stellar parameters of HD
185806 corresponds to an 1.3 M(cid:12) star. Figure 8 illustrates
the evolutionary track of a 1.3 M(cid:12) star, in the HR diagram,
together with the extracted parameters of HD 185806. The
star is lying on the red giant branch (RGB) phase. This is
consistent with the chemical signatures of the star that were
discussed in Section 3. Such an evidence is also aligned to
the formation of the cocoon tail detected around HD 185806

winds, able to shape dense circumstellar structures around

4.2 On the morphology of the cocoon tail around

HD 185806

The evolutionary state and the high spatial velocity of
HD 185806 implies that the observed wind-blown bubble
morphology around the star is dominantly determined by
the interaction between the stellar wind material and the
surrounding ISM.

The circumstellar structures around supersonically mov-
ing stars are characterized by a bow-shaped shell formed in
the direction of the stellar motion, followed by a cocoon/tail
morphology. In the case where the wind and the ISM ﬂows
are supersonic, with respect to the sound speed of the local
medium, shock waves are formed. The formed shock waves
compress and heat up the medium that are propagating. The
resulting bow shock structure consists of a forward shock sep-
arating the unshocked and shocked ISM, a wind termination
shock that marks the border between the free-expanding wind
and the shocked wind, and ﬁnally a contact discontinuity lies
between the two shocks separating the shocked wind from
the shocked ISM shells (see Weaver et al. 1977 and Lamers
& Cassinelli 1999). The position and shape of the bow shock
is governed by the ram pressure balance between the stellar
wind and the ISM, that in turn is determined by the wind
mass loss rate ( ˙M ) and terminal velocity (uw), the stellar
systemic velocity (u∗) and the local ISM density (ρISM). In
the direction of the stellar motion the bow shock is at its
shorter distance - called as stagnation point - the radius of

The CSM around HD 185806 displays a cocoon-tail struc-
ture behind the star which indicates the presence of shocked
ISM/wind material by the forward and termination shock of
the wind bubble. However, even though a bow shock struc-
ture is clearly depicted at the WISE images (Wright et al.
2010) (see the yellow contours in Fig. 6), there is no evidence
of the bow shock in the optical band. The current complex
properties of the CSM around HD 185806 and the absence of
an optically bright bow shock shell can be attributed to the
following three main reasons (or to a combination of them):

4.2.1 Proximity of the bow shock to the central star

In cases where the formed bow shock lies very close to the star
it is likely to be out-shined by the stellar radiation or/and to
be obscured by the produced stellar dust. To assess the plau-
sibility of this statement in Fig. 9 we illustrate the radial
distance between the star and the stagnation point, as given
by Eq. (1), for diﬀerent values of RGB stellar winds and of
the ISM density. The dashed red line in Fig. 9 indicates the
threshold below which the bow shock is not expected to be
observed in the optical as it coincides with the area where the

of the bow shock from the star for varying values of wind veloc-
ity (Uwind) and ISM density (nism). The blue line corresponds

nism=10. The dashed red line shows the distance below which the

central star radiation dominates. As it is clearly portrayed, for
the case where the ISM density is higher nISM (cid:62) 1cm−3 the
predicted stagnation point radius is below the deﬁned thresh-
old for moderate mass loss rates ( ˙M (cid:46) 10−7 M(cid:12) yr−1), some-
thing that makes this scenario plausible.

From a statistical point of view, half of the RGB/AGB
stars and red supergiants with bow-shock shells studied by
Cox et al. (2012) have a stagnation point at a de-projected
distance of <0.08 pc, while there are 29 more stars without
any detection. Therefore, the non-detection of a clear bow-
shock in the HD 185806 is not unique or even rare, something
that advocates further towards the credibility of the initial
assumption.

4.2.2 Time variable stellar wind properties

A second possible explanation of the non-detection of an op-
tical emitting bow shock is based on the current evolutionary
state of HD 185806. As we discussed in Section 4.1, the ob-
served properties of the central star indicate that HD 185806
is currently at the RGB phase evolving towards the core he-
lium burning/early AGB phase. If indeed the central star is
in a transition state between two evolutionary stages it is
likely that in the recent past its stellar wind properties (mass
loss rate and wind velocity) have changed substantially. In
particular, in this transition phase the mass loss rate is ex-
pected to decrease and the wind terminal velocity to increase.
As a result, the freely expanding wind density drops signiﬁ-
cantly. In the framework of this scenario, the lack of an op-

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2022)

tically bright bow shock around HD 185806 is attributed to
the low wind-bubble density in which the terminating shock
is propagating. In addition, the information about the stel-
lar wind properties alteration is not communicated sponta-
neously throughout the circumstellar structure but it travels
within the dynamic timescale of the wind ﬂow: tﬂow ∼ r
,
uw
where r the distance from the mass-losing star and uw the
wind velocity. Thus, there is the chance that we are currently
witnessing a transition phase of the CSM around HD 185806,
were in the region close to the stagnation point a low density
wind is dominant, while the observed cocoon tail structure
corresponds the imprint of an anterior phase where dense and
bright CSM structures were formed.

4.2.3 Deviation of the ambient medium from homogeneity

The above discussed arguments assume an uniform ambient
medium in the warm phase (TISM ≈ 1000 − 8000 K) of the
ISM of the Milky Way (McKee 1995). The establishment of a
stellar wind bow shock being both a function of the wind and
ISM density combined with the absence of an observed arc
around runaway stars, can indicate runaway stellar objects
moving through a hot low-density region (?). However, this
argument does not apply to HD 185806 since the bow shock
is visible in near-infrared but not in optical.

Nevertheless, any deviation from uniformity in the ambi-
ent medium aﬀects the development of its circumstellar neb-
ula. For example, the presence of native ISM overdensities
and/or disturbances of the velocity ﬁeld interacting with the
forward shock of the bow shock induces distortions of the
layers of shocked material that produce bright optical, free-
free and near-infrared knots in the regions of shocked material
(Baalmann et al. 2021; Herbst et al. 2022). Consequently, po-
tential irregularities in the ISM density ﬁeld in the vicinity
of HD 185806 can only take the form of local underdensities
which would make its bow shock deviate from the analytic
solution of Wilkin (1996). Such an example, is the production
of a local extension of the forward shock, which is aﬀected by
Rayleigh-Taylor and other non-linear instabilities (Vishniac
1994). The star could be moving in an ISM gradually decreas-
ing along the direction of stellar motion. This may explain
the wise 22 µm protuberances in the south-west region of
Fig. 6.

Another assumption that has been tacitly made is that the
ambient medium around HD 185806 is characterized by the
local ISM properties. Thus, it has been neglected any ambi-
ent medium modiﬁcations that occurred in a prior phase of
the central star’s evolution, namely the main-sequence (MS)
phase.

The complex internal morphology of the cocoon around
HD 185806 could potentially be explained considering that
the current circumstellar structure around HD 185806 re-
sulted by the evolution of the RSG wind bubble within the
interior of the previously formed MS bubble. The arcs and
ﬁlamentary shapes visible via the [O iii] emission of Fig. 6
not only trace the internal border of the cocoon, but also
appear as bright structures parallel to the direction of stel-
lar motion. The former can reasonably be associated to the
contact discontinuity of the main-sequence wind-blown bub-
ble at the moment it is shocked by the new-born RGB wind.
Regarding the twisted optical arcs encompassed by the in-
frared cocoon we propose that they are projection eﬀects

similar to those found in the three-dimensional magneto-
hydrodynamical simulations of Meyer et al. (2021). It is
shown that the instabilities developing in the termination
shock of the stellar wind bow shock of red supergiant stars
can turn, by projection eﬀects, into a large variety of opti-
cal Hα ﬁlaments, including parallel optical segments to the
direction of stellar motion, see Fig. 10f,h and Fig. 11e,h in
Meyer et al. (2021). We argue that a similar mechanism is at
work inside of the cocoon of HD 185806.

HD 185806 should have recently entered into its cur-
rent, red giant branch, evolutionary phase, its circumstel-
lar medium is not in a steady state (Mohamed et al. 2012)
and the time-variability of its stellar wind is a key param-
eter into the deep understanding of its cocoon. With this
in mind it raises the question of its future evolution, particu-
larly within the predictive models for fast-moving stars in the
AGB, thermally-pulsating AGB stars and planetary nebula
phase of Villaver & Stanghellini (2005). The series of papers
of Villaver & Stanghellini (2005) strengthens the interpre-
tation of the observed cocoon as a transient circumstellar
structure generated by the onset of the RGB evolutionary
phase, which might be replaced by an AGB wind to be re-
leased into the cocoon. The surroundings of HD 185806 may
then eventually evolve to those of a thermal-pulsating AGB
star, as depicted in the numerical models of Villaver et al.
(2012).

the cocoon around
HD 185806 reveals a dynamical and internal synthesis of a
nebula which exceeds that of a simple steady-state stellar
wind bow shock. Further investigation would require more so-
phisticated numerical models. However, we can still elaborate
on the shock properties by means of analytic arguments, as
done in, e.g. Stevens et al. (1992); Gvaramadze et al. (2011);
Chiotellis et al. (2012, 2016); Meyer et al. (2017). In order to
characterise the observed shock, we will use the methodology
described in Gvaramadze et al. (2011), and the latter works
which were designed to characterise simulated hydrodynam-
ical shocks.

Bow shocks are mainly characterised by two quantities,
namely the dynamical tdyn = r0/v and cooling tcool =
3kBTps/npsΛ(Tps) timescales, respectively, where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, Tps the post-shock temperature at the
forward shock, nps the post-shock density at the forward
shock and Λ(Tps) the corresponding cooling rate by optically-
thin processes, see Meyer et al. (2014). According to Fig. 9,
the stand-oﬀ distance of the cocoon is ≈ 0.1 (cid:54) r0 (cid:54)
1.0 pc. Since the bulk motion of the star is v? = 45 km s−1,
we have v = v?/4 ≈ 11.25 km s−1 and therefore tdyn ≈
0.0088−0.088 Myr assuming r0 = 0.1−1.0 pc.

Similarly, the cooling timescale is obtained by estimating
ﬁrst the conditions in the post-shock region at the forward
shock using the relations in section 5.3 of Gvaramadze et al.
(2011). This gives Tps ≈ 1.4 ×105(v?/100 km s−1)2 ≈ 28350 K
and nps = 4nISM = 0.4−40 cm−3 (assuming the explored
parameter space of Fig. 9). Using the cooling curve de-
tailed in Meyer et al. (2014), one can ﬁnd Λ(Tps) = 4.78 ×
10−23 erg cm3 s−1. Consequently, tcool = 0.019−0.00019 Myr
for nISM = 0.1−10 cm−3.

The creation of large bow shock (r0 = 1.0 pc) is possible
with a diluted ambient only (nISM = 0.1 cm−3), for which it
is found that tcool = 0.019 ∼ tdyn ≈ 0.088 Myr, indicating
that the shock is adiabatic, with both timescales being of the
same order of magnitude. The creation of small bow shock
(r0 = 0.1 pc) is possible in a dense ISM (nISM = 10 cm−3),
gives tcool = 0.00019 (cid:28) tdyn ≈ 0.0088 Myr, meaning that the
shock is radiative.

The stellar evolution calculations performed in the con-
˙M (cid:54)
text of HD 185806 show that its mass-loss rate is
10−7 M(cid:12) yr−1 This value favors the scenario of the existence
of a small bow shock (r0 = 0.1 pc) and therefore of a radia-
tive forward shock of the circumstellar cocoon of HD 185806.
This should additionally be conﬁrmed by multi-dimensional
hydrodynamical calculations in our following studies.

4.4 3D morpho-kinematic modeling of the cocoon

shell

For the Morpho-kinematic (MK) modeling of the cocoon tail
of HD 185806 in three-dimensions, we employed the astro-
nomical software SHAPE (Steﬀen et al. 2011). This code has
been widely used to model morpho-kinematic structures of
planetary nebulae (e.g. Akras & Steﬀen 2012; Akras & López
2012; Akras et al. 2015; Clyne et al. 2015), nova shells (Har-
vey et al. 2020) and more recently complex supernova rem-
nants (Derlopa et al. 2020). Despite the cocoon tail of HD
185806 displays a simple ellipsoidal morphology, the intrigu-
ing formation of the nebula behind the highly moving star
motivated us to reproduce the observed position-velocity di-
agram and reconstruct the 3D velocity ﬁeld.

The wide ﬁeld image of HD 185806 in the [O iii] line, along
with the PV diagrams in the Hα and [O iii] emission lines
were used to constrain the morpho-kinematic structure of the
cocoon tail. An ellipsoidal structure with a projected size of
3.6×2.4 arcmin2 can adequately reproduce the nebula behind
the HD 185806 star. The position angle of the cocoon tail is
found to be ∼19◦ and the inclination angle ∼10◦, both with
respect to the plane of the sky, i.e. the star goes inwards the
page, as it is shown in Fig. 10(a).

For the expansion velocity law of the shell gas, a homolo-
−→
V = k −→r ) was applied. The centre of the
gous expansion law (
velocity law is on the HD 185806 star and not at the geomet-
rical centre of the nebula such as in PNe, resulting in faster
expanding gas at larger distances from the star. Fig. 10(b)
shows the 3D grid structure of the cocoon tail along with
the vectors of the velocity ﬁeld (magnitude and direction).
The red dot represents the location of the star. Fig. 10(c)
illustrates the matching between the observed (black) and
modelled (colored) PV diagrams reproduced with SHAPE.
According to our model, the mean value for the k constant
parameter in the homologous expansion is 31.3 km sec−1
arcmin−1.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the properties of the source HD 185806
and of its newly detected optical cocoon tail. By performing
a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the source in the
optical ﬁlters Hα, [O iii], Hα+[N ii] and [N ii] we report that:

and red-shifted gas.

• The star is an M type star followed by an optical co-
coon tail with intense [O iii] emission. The [O iii] ﬂux of the
ﬁlaments ranges from 2.7 to 8.5×10−12 erg s−1 cm−2. The
spectroscopic analysis of the results shows that the heliocen-
tric expansion velocity of the ﬁlaments ranges between -100
to 40 km s−1, and the systemic velocity is
45 km s−1.

• We used the virtual observatory SED analyzer (VOSA;
Bayo et al. 2008) in which we imported all the available pho-
tometric data of the star and constructed the SED of the
source from 4000 Å up to 100 µm. The SED implies an ef-
fective temperature Teﬀ=3400±100 K and logL=3.18 L(cid:12) as
well as an infrared excess. The stellar parameters obtained
from VOSA were used to create an HR diagram using the
MESA models and evolutionary tracks. MESA models im-
plied that the star is a 1.3 M(cid:12) star in the RGB/early-AGB
phase.

• We investigated the absence of an optically bright bow
shock shell around HD 185806 which can be attributed to two
main factors: the distance of the stagnation point regarding
the star and the current evolutionary state of HD 185806.
In the ﬁrst case the bow shock could be outshined by the

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2022)

stellar radiation or/and be obscured by the large amount of
dust that lies close to the central star (Fig. 9). In the second
case, as the models imply that the star is in the transition
phase between the RGB/early AGB phase, the wind mass-
loss rate undergoes a decrease and the wind terminal veloc-
ity increases. As a result, the freely expanding wind density
props by several orders of magnitude and the dense stellar
wind bubble is transformed into a low density cavity. Re-
garding the statistical facts provided in Cox et al. (2012) the
non-detectability of a bow shock in the optical regime is not
uncommon.

• The 3D morpho-kinematic model we created for the co-
coon tail shows that its morphology can be reproduced by an
ellipsoidal structure with a projected size of 3.6×2.4 arcmin2,
a position angle of ∼19◦ and an inclination of ∼10◦ (Fig. 10a).
We studied the expansion velocity using a homologous law

V = k −→r ) as shown in Fig. 10(b) and, according to our
(
model, the mean value for the k constant parameter is 31.3
km sec−1 arcmin−1.
