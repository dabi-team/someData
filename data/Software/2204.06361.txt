Summary

A major part of computational materials science and computational chemistry concerns calcu-
lations of total energy diﬀerences and electronic excitations of poly-atomic systems. Currently,
the most prevalent method for such computations is density-functional theory (Hohenberg &
Kohn, 1964) (DFT) based on the Kohn-Sham formalism (Kohn & Sham, 1965) (KS) together
with one of the numerous exchange-correlation (xc) approximations (Civalleri et al., 2012;
Sousa et al., 2007). The trade-oﬀ between comparably low computational cost and often
reliably accurate results render it the dominant method in the ﬁeld. Often, however, the
accuracy of the xc approximations is not suﬃcent and uncertain, in particular when electronic
correlations play a decisive role (Savin & Johnson, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang & Grüneis,
2019).
Coupled-cluster (CC) methods (Čížek, 1966), while substantially more computationally ex-
pensive have proven to be signiﬁcantly more accurate and reliable, at least for molecules
and non-metallic solids. On these grounds, they allow for a systematic accuracy benchmark
of other methods.
Indeed, in molecular quantum chemistry the CC approach is considered
the gold standard for a theoretical description of binding energies and electronic properties
(Chan, 2019).
It is typically used (at least) for benchmark studies. While the original CC
methodology allows to calculate the groundstate total energy of a system, it is also possible
to compute properties of excited states using the equation-of-motion formalism of CC (EOM-
CC) with comparable accuracy and reliability (Stanton & Bartlett, 1993). The conventional
CC approach is limited, however, to systems with about 50 electrons (Feller & Dixon, 2001;
Gyevi-Nagy et al., 2019). By employing approximations, which exploit the locality of electronic
correlation, materials with a couple of hundreds of electrons have been calculated via local
natural orbital CC (LNO-CC) (Nagy & Kállay, 2019) and explicitly correlated pair natural
orbital CC (PNO-CC-F12) (Ma & Werner, 2021). The extension of CC to periodic systems
(Hirata et al., 2004) has been explored to a great degree by the research groups of Andreas
Grüneis and Garnet Chan.

In the work of Andreas Grüneis et al. the periodic formulation of CC was, for example, applied
to study the adsorption behavior and surface chemistry of 2-dimensional materials including
graphene (Al-Hamdani et al., 2017), boron-nitride (Brandenburg et al., 2019) and surfaces
(Tsatsoulis et al., 2018). These studies showed that CC yields consistently accurate adsorption
energies and reaction energetics. The work of the groups of Garnet Chan and Timothy
Berkelbach addressed the electronic properties of 2- and 3-dimensional materials. By applying
the periodic equation-of-motion (EOM) CC formalism, band paths, optical spectra and band
gaps of various materials (diamond, silicon, nickel oxide and others)
have been investigated (Gao et al., 2020; McClain et al., 2017; Wang & Berkelbach, 2020).

It is important to note that all the periodic CC calculations published so far utilized pseu-
dopotentials (Kresse & Joubert, 1999) to largely disregard the eﬀect of core electrons. One

notable distinction between the works of the two groups, is the type of basis set used. While
the CC4S code of Andreas Grüneis et al. uses a plane-wave basis, the group of Garnet Chan
perform their calculations using gaussian basis sets (McClain et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018).
Localized atom-centred basis sets like gaussian orbitals or numerical atomic orbitals (NAO)
(Blum et al., 2009) can potentially decrease the computational cost. This is mostly due to the
locality of the basis functions and their improved description of the atomic core region, which
decreases the number of basis functions necessary for accurate computations of the system.

This paper describes a generalizable interface, called CC-aims, to the Coupled-Cluster
for solids code (CC4S) developed by Andreas Grüneis et al. The interface is formulated
in a general way and demonstrated here for the all-electron FHI-aims code (Blum et al.,
2009). A generalization to other codes with atom-centered basis functions is straight for-
ward. This interface expands the power of electronic-structure theory codes to a variety of
correlated methods. These include Møller-Plesset perturbation theory to second order (MP2),
coupled-cluster theory including single and double excitations (CCSD) and CCSD including the
perturbative treatment of triple excitations (CCSD(T)). Implementations of EOM-CC for neu-
tral (EE-EOM-CC) and charged (IP-EOM-CC/EA-EOM-CC) excitations are currently under
development. CC-aims can be used directly by any software package which uses a localized
basis set and employs a resolution-of-identity scheme (Ren et al., 2012) (RI). On the one hand,
this includes local RI schemes, which expand products of atomic orbital basis function (AOs)
pairs only using auxiliary basis functions which are localized on either of the atoms of the
AOs. Primary examples for this family of localized schemes is the RI-LVL approach employed
by FHI-aims (Ihrig et al., 2015), ADF (Förster & Visscher, 2020) and ABACUS (Lin et al.,
2020) and the the pair-atomic RI (PARI) (Merlot et al., 2013). On the other hand, more
conventional non-local schemes, which are predominantly used in molecular calculations, like
RI-V (Whitten, 1973) and RI-SVS (Feyereisen et al., 1993) are recognized by CC-aims as well.

Statement of need

The only input quantity of CC4S, which is not typically calculated in quantum chemistry
or electronic structure codes, but which is computed by CC-aims, is the Coulomb vertex
(Hummel et al., 2017). The Coulomb vertex, a rank-3 tensor, constitutes a memory-saving,
approximation of the rank-4 tensor of Coulomb integrals. The storage of Coulomb integrals
is the major memory bottleneck in CC calculations, so that the utilization of the Coulomb
vertex expands the scope of system sizes which can be calculated. While in the case of
localized orbitals the herein presented CC-aims interface can be used, in the case of plane-
wave basis sets a diﬀerent approach to calculate the Coulomb vertex has to be taken, which is
described in (Hummel et al., 2017). For Quantum chemistry programs employing a localized
basis additionally the use of an RI scheme is needed or needs to be implemented. CC-aims
allows software packages which either lack certain Quantum chemistry algorithms completely
or which only oﬀer insuﬃciently optimized implementations easy access to these methods.
Interfaces like CC-aims will substantially accelerate the research done in areas, where DFT
is too inaccurate or too unreliable, by allowing many electronic structure codes to participate
in these investigations without the time-consuming eﬀort of implementing correlated wave-
function methods.
