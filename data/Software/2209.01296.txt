ABSTRACT

Context. Ground-based high-resolution spectrographs are key instruments for several astrophysical domains, such as exoplanet studies. Unfor-
tunately, the observed spectra are contaminated by the Earth’s atmosphere and its large molecular absorption bands. While diﬀerent techniques
(forward radiative transfer models, principle component analysis (PCA), or other empirical methods) exist to correct for telluric lines in exoplanet
atmospheric studies, in radial velocity (RV) studies, telluric lines with an absorption depth of >2 % are generally masked, which poses a problem
for faint targets and M dwarfs as most of their RV content is present where telluric contamination is important.
Aims. We propose a simple telluric model to be embedded in the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Ob-
servations (ESPRESSO) data reduction software (DRS). The goal is to provide telluric-free spectra and enable RV measurements through the
cross-correlation function technique (and others), including spectral ranges where telluric lines fall.
Methods. The model is a line-by-line radiative transfer code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. We use the sky conditions and the physical
properties of the lines from the HITRAN database to create the telluric spectrum. This high-resolution model is then convolved with the instru-
mental resolution and sampled to the instrumental wavelength grid. A subset of selected telluric lines is used to robustly ﬁt the spectrum through
a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm.
Results. We computed the model to the H2O lines in the spectral range of ESPRESSO. When applied to stellar spectra from A0- to M5-type stars,
the residuals of the strongest water lines are below the 2% peak-to-valley (P2V) amplitude for all spectral types, with the exception of M dwarfs,
which are within the pseudo-continuum. We then determined the RVs from the telluric-corrected ESPRESSO spectra of Tau Ceti and Proxima.
We created telluric-free masks and compared the obtained RVs with the DRS RVs. In the case of Tau Ceti, we identiﬁed that micro-telluric lines
introduce systematics up to an amplitude of 58 cm · s−1 and with a period of one year if not corrected. For Proxima, the impact of micro-telluric
lines is negligible due to the low ﬂux below 5900 Å. For late-type stars, the gain in spectral content at redder wavelengths is equivalent to a gain
of 25% in photon noise or a factor of 1.78 in exposure time. This leads to better constraints on the semi-amplitude and eccentricity of Proxima d,
which was recently proposed as a planet candidate. Finally, we applied our telluric model to the O2 γ-band and we obtained residuals below the
2% P2V amplitude.
Conclusions. We propose a simple telluric model for high-resolution spectrographs to correct individual spectra and to achieve precise RVs. The
removal of micro-telluric lines, coupled with the gain in spectral range, leads to more precise RVs. Moreover, we showcase that our model can be
applied to other molecules, and thus to other wavelength regions observed by other spectrographs, such as NIRPS.

1. Introduction

The Earth’s atmosphere is rich in spectral
features. The
molecules H2O, O2, O3, CH4, and CO2 are the main molecules
from 0.3 to 5 microns in the Earth’s transmission spectrum
(also called the telluric spectrum). When astrophysical objects
are observed with ground-based instruments,
is
absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere, and thus their spectrum
is contaminated by the telluric spectrum. At high spectral
resolution, the telluric lines are well resolved and thousands of
them can be distinguished. Moreover, at speciﬁc wavelengths,
they completely absorb the light of the observed object, thus

their light

pean Southern Observatory under ESO program 1102.C-0744 by the

losing any astrophysical content. The absorption of the telluric
spectrum varies as a function of the volume mixing ratio along
the line of sight, which is controlled at ﬁrst order by airmass.
The exception for this is the water vapor, for which water
column density and total content in the line of sight changes
inhomogeneously across the sky and over a timescale of hours
due to the weather conditions (Li et al. 2018).

With increasing instrumental performances and a larger
telescope collecting area, developing methodologies to measure
high-ﬁdelity unbiased spectra is becoming a real challenge for
several astrophysical topics such as an accurate stellar library,
stellar activity indicators, precise stellar radial velocity (RV),
exoplanet atmospheric characterization, or the measurement of
the ﬁne structure constant. Therefore, accurate correction of

the Earth’s transmission spectrum is crucial in the process of
obtaining high-ﬁdelity results. Several methods are available
for removing the telluric spectrum from complex model-based
algorithms (e.g., Molecfit (Smette et al. 2015; Kausch et al.
2015), TAPAS (Bertaux et al. 2014), and TELFIT (Gullikson
et al. 2014)) to the observation of a spectrophotometric standard
star close in time and in the sky to the scientiﬁc observation
(Vidal-Madjar et al. 1986). Ulmer-Moll et al. (2019) com-
pared these diﬀerent approaches for near-infrared archival
data obtained with CRIRES. The authors concluded that the
model-based approach better corrects water telluric lines while
the standard star is more appropriate for correcting the O2
lines. Such methods can be applied to diﬀerent astrophysical
objects. Other studies are more focused on the detection of
exoplanets through RV and on the characterization of their
atmospheres. For example, Artigau et al. (2014) proposed an
approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) built
over a library of spectrophotometric standard stars for archival
HARPS data. They obtained a better RV accuracy by including
a wider telluric-corrected spectral domain when compared with
the restricted telluric-free domain used. Empirical approaches,
of which PCA is one (e.g., SYSREM; Mazeh et al. (2007)),
are also often used for exoplanet atmospheric studies and take
advantage of the diﬀerent RV components of the planet, the star,
and the Earth (Snellen et al. 2010). In addition to PCA-based
algorithms, forward modeling algorithms are used to study exo-
planet atmospheres (e.g., Allart et al. 2017). However, forward
modeling algorithms are not yet optimized to automatically
produce precise RVs as their minimization algorithm can be
biased by stellar contamination depending on the combination
of the spectral type, systemic velocity, and barycentric Earth
radial velocity (BERV). Allart et al. (2017) demonstrated this
with Molecfit, which is very sensitive to the selection of
telluric regions that are to be ﬁtted, in order to perform the most
optimal correction.

Precise RVs are obtained, with stable high-resolution spectro-
graphs, by cross-correlating stellar spectra with a binary mask
(Baranne et al. 1996; Pepe et al. 2002) or through template-
matching algorithms (e.g., Anglada-Escudé & Butler 2012;
Astudillo-Defru et al. 2015; Zechmeister et al. 2018). Telluric
lines spoil RV measurements when they are not removed or
corrected for, independently of the method used to measure RVs.
Exclusion of the telluric lines can be quickly done, either by
masking the complete bands or by masking each line manually
on each spectrum (e.g., Astudillo-Defru et al. 2015). Only the
telluric lines of O2, H2O, and OH aﬀect measurements in the
visible wavelength. Since these cover a comparatively small
fraction of the wavelength range, discarding them from the
analysis has a comparatively small eﬀect. However, with the de-
velopment of high-resolution spectrographs in the near-infrared
(CARMENES (Quirrenbach et al. 2014), SPIRou (Donati et al.
2020), and NIRPS (Wildi et al. 2017)) or installed on larger
collecting areas (ESPRESSO (Pepe et al. 2021)), the need for an
automatic and homogeneous telluric removal tool became ap-
parent. Moreover, Cunha et al. (2013), Lisogorskyi et al. (2019),
and Xuesong Wang et al. (2019) noticed that micro-telluric lines
(unresolved or very shallow lines, with a depth up to 2%), which
are generally not excluded when building the cross-correlation
function (CCF), can introduce systematics in the RV at a level
of 10 - 20 cm · s−1, which is comparable to the expected RV pre-
cision of the state-of-the-art optical spectrographs (ESPRESSO
(Pepe et al. 2021), EXPRES (Jurgenson et al. 2016)) and to the
precision required in order to detect an Earth-Sun system analog.

In recent years, several techniques have been developed to
overcome the limitation of (micro-) telluric lines to reach
extremely precise RVs. Similar to Artigau et al. (2014), Leet
et al. (2019) propose the self-calibrating, empirical, light-weight
linear regression telluric (SELENITE) model. They use the
variation in water telluric line depths as a function of the precip-
itable water vapor and the variation in non-water lines with the
airmass to model the telluric spectrum. They do not require any
line list database, but instead they use the observations of a few
dozen B stars to build their SELENITE telluric database. The
authors applied their correction to EXPRES data and reached
average residuals similar to model-based corrections discussed
in Ulmer-Moll et al. (2019). Artigau et al. (2021) propose a
two-step approach where they apply the ﬁrst correction with a
TAPAS model scaled to the water content and airmass. Then,
they use the PCA-based approach discussed in Artigau et al.
(2014) on the residuals of the TAPAS correction. The authors
applied their technique to SPIRou data (in the near-infrared,
which is more polluted by telluric lines in comparison to the
visible) of TOI-1278. Finally, Bedell et al. (2019) and Cretignier
et al. (2021) also propose data-driven approaches with the
Wobble and YARARA algorithms that use the time series of a
given star to disentangle the contribution of the telluric spectrum
from the stellar spectrum. Therefore, their methods can only be
applied as a postprocessing step as they require a large number
of spectra of the same object with a large enough variation in
the BERV. With additional analysis treatment, the authors are
able to reduce the RV root mean square (rms) by 10-20% in
comparison to the classical reduction for HARPS observations.
Figure 1 shows where the telluric lines fall on top of G-
and M5-type stars observed with the ESPRESSO spectrograph.
Both H2O and O2 bands are present across the full spectral
range of ESPRESSO but their intensities increase toward redder
wavelengths. The ESPRESSO data reduction software (DRS),
which builds upon the HARPS DRS, excludes the wavelength
ranges (gray bands) of the telluric lines and the active stellar
lines (Ca II H & K, Na doublet, and Balmer lines) when the
CCFs are built. This drastic measure masks up to ∼27% of the
spectral range of ESPRESSO, which is essential for analyzing
late-type stars as their blackbody maxima are toward redder
wavelengths. Moreover, lines at redder wavelengths are known
to be less impacted by stellar activity (Suárez Mascareño et al.
2020). Micro-telluric water bands are not excluded when the
CCFs are built (5000-5900 Å). The impact of these lines on the
RV content of HARPS was considered negligible in comparison
to the number of stellar lines present at the same positions.
the collecting area of the Very Large Telescope
However,
(VLT), the wider spectral range to redder wavelengths, and
the improved instrumental stability of ESPRESSO increase
their impact, arguably to a detectable level, as demonstrated by
Cunha et al. (2013).

The aforementioned telluric correction techniques are not
practical for integration into an automatic pipeline to reduce
individual frames and to be used by the whole community. In
addition, having an additional database of telluric standards
and complex forward models that require manual intervention
are clear limitations. Therefore, we explore in this paper how
a simple telluric model could rapidly correct the spectra of
astrophysical objects with a minimal number of assumptions.
The telluric model is based on a line-by-line radiative transfer
code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. It only requires
information on the sky observations, knowledge of the instru-

mental resolution, and a line list database such as HITRAN
(Rothman et al. 2013). This algorithm will be implemented in
the oﬃcial DRS of ESPRESSO. Therefore, the model is built for
the S2D_BLAZE_A spectra of ESPRESSO from which the CCFs
are derived. The S2D_BLAZE_A product is the echelle-extracted
spectra in the Earth’s rest frame produced by the ESPRESSO
DRS before removing the blaze to preserve the relative lines’
strengths. We present a special focus on the telluric correction
of water lines, which are the most numerous and variable, and
therefore the most problematic telluric lines in the spectral range
of ESPRESSO.

In Sect. 2 we describe our one-layer telluric model. In Sect. 3,
we describe how the telluric model parameters are adjusted to the
data. In Sect. 4, we apply the telluric correction to diﬀerent spec-
tral types. Section 5 presents the implications of the telluric cor-
rection of water for the RV time series of Tau Ceti and Proxima
obtained with ESPRESSO. Afterward, we open the discussion
to telluric correction of the O2 molecular bands with its impli-
cation for other molecules and spectral domains in Sect. 6. We
conclude in Sect. 7.

2. Model description

To build the Earth’s transmission spectrum, one needs to con-
sider that its atmosphere is a gas that attenuates the stellar light
as a function of the optical path length. Following the descrip-
tion on the HITRAN website1, the telluric spectrum T (ν) follows
the Beer-Lambert law and can be expressed as a function of the

sum of the opacity function τ(ν) of each telluric line. The telluric
spectrum is built in wavenumber units, ν, in cm−1:

T (ν) = e− (cid:80) τ(ν).

(1)

The opacity function of a single line depends on the absorp-
tion cross-section σ(ν) in cm2/molecule, the number density n(z)
in molecule · cm−3, and the path length l in centimeters:

τ(ν) =

(cid:90) l

σ(ν) · n(z) · dz.

If a single atmospheric layer at constant pressure and a ho-
mogeneous distribution of water vapor is considered, we can see
that

where nH2O = 3.34 · 1022 molecules · cm−3, is a constant express-
ing the number of water molecules per unit volume of liquid wa-
ter, and IWVLOS is the integrated water vapor in the line of sight,
which represents the condensed water column in millimeters.

Therefore, Equation 1 can be rewritten as

Similarly, the line positions, ν∗

ations, where δair is the pressure shift and P is the gas pressure:

To build a telluric spectrum that we will be able to use for
the echelle-extracted spectra produced by the ESPRESSO DRS
(S2D hereinafter), we build the model by spectral order. The
wavenumber grid has a resolution of 3 000 000 and the grid is
larger than the S2D grid by 40 km · s−1 (1 Å at 7500 Å) on each
side of the orders to account for the BERV that shifts the spec-
trum on the detectors by, at most, 30 km · s−1. The wavenumber
grid is then converted into angstrom and convolved with a Gaus-
sian instrumental proﬁle to produce the spectrum as would be
seen by ESPRESSO. The width of the convolving Gaussian cor-
responds to the width of the Gaussian on the previously produced
spectral resolution map (discussed in Sect 2.4). Finally, the last
step consists in resampling the convolved telluric model to the
S2D grid.

2.1. Line proﬁles
Diﬀerent line proﬁles to model the telluric lines have been con-
sidered: Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt proﬁles.

2.1.1. Gaussian proﬁle

The Gaussian proﬁle is the theoretical proﬁle describing the ther-
mal broadening of a line and is expressed as

fGaussian(ν) =

where α is the Gaussian half width at half maximum (HWHM)
that depends on the Avogadro number NA = 6.02 · 1023 mol−1,
the Boltzmann constant kb = 1.38 · 10−23 kg · m2 · s−2, the gas
temperature T , the speed of light c, and the molar mass of water,
Mmol = 18.01 g · mol−1:

(10)

The Gaussian proﬁle depends mainly on the temperature and
not on the pressure. The Gaussian proﬁle is expected to domi-
nate in the upper part of the Earth’s atmosphere, where pressure
broadening is negligible.

Article number, page 4 of 18

The Lorentzian proﬁle depends mainly on the pressure and
not on the temperature. The Lorentzian proﬁle is expected to
dominate in the lower part of the Earth’s atmosphere, where
pressure is higher and, coincidently, where most of the water
vapor is located.

2.1.3. Voigt proﬁle

The Voigt proﬁle is simply the convolution of the Gaussian and
Lorentzian proﬁles. Formally, it is the proﬁle that should be used
to reproduce telluric lines because all lines have a contribution
of thermal and pressure broadening:

fVoigt(ν) = fLorentzian(ν) ∗ fGaussian(ν).

(14)

2.2. HITRAN line list

We use the HITRAN (Rothman et al. 2013; Gordon et al.
2017) database to build the telluric spectrum. Lines from 3800
16O that have a line intensity stronger than
to 8000 Å for H2
10−26 cm−1/(molecule · cm−2) are selected. If too few lines are
included, the model will not be representative of the observa-
tion. When too many lines are included, the weakest lines that
do not contribute to the telluric spectrum increase the computa-
tion time, as they are the most numerous (see Fig. 2).

The cut-oﬀ at 10−26 cm−1/(molecule · cm−2) was obtained
after including more lines or less lines in the model (Fig. 3), and
by looking at the dispersion and peak-to-valley (P2V) amplitude
of the residuals. It ensures that we model all telluric lines that
would be seen in spectra with S/N>105 per pixel, much higher
than typical observations, while keeping computing times
reasonable.

The following parameters of each line have been ex-
tracted: νi j (vacuum wavenumber in cm−1), S i j (line inten-
sity in cm−1/(molecule · cm−2)), γair (air-broadened HWHM in
cm−1/atm), γsel f (self-broadened HWHM in cm−1/atm), nair
(temperature dependence exponent for γair in cm−1), δair (air-
pressure-induced line shift in cm−1/atm) and E” (lower state en-
ergy in cm−1). Another important parameter from the HITRAN
database is the table of the total partition sum value, QT , for
H2

16O, which assigns a QT value to each temperature.

have it in atm), and the integrated water vapor2 IWV measured at
the zenith in millimeters, which represents the condensed water
column. The IWV in the line of sight can be approximated by

IWVLOS = IWV · Airmass.

(15)

2.4. Resolution map

The next step consists in convolving the telluric model with the
appropriate instrument line spread function (LSF) to reproduce,
in the best possible way, the observed spectrum. The instrumen-
tal LSF can be approximated by a Gaussian with its full-width
half maximum (FWHM) equal to the instrumental resolution.
However, the instrumental resolution is not constant across the
spectrum. It depends on the optics used to project the light on the
detectors, and on potential mechanical tensions on the detectors.
To characterize the instrumental resolution of ESPRESSO across
the detectors (Pepe et al. 2021), the light of a thorium-argon
lamp, used for calibration, is injected into the science ﬁber. Tho-
rium lines are spread across both detectors and are present at sev-
eral pixel positions in each order. As they are ultra-narrow lines,
they are not resolved, and thus their FWHM is a direct mea-
sure of the instrumental resolution. Consequently, it is possible
to map the detector and derive a resolution map of ESPRESSO
for the diﬀerent observing modes. To obtain a resolution value at
each pixel of each order, we applied a two-dimensional polyno-
mial ﬁt, where x corresponds to the pixel of each order y:

R = a · x + b · y + c · x · y + d · x2 + e · y2 + f · x2 · y2 + g.

(16)

This parametrization was found to best reproduce the
instrumental resolution measured on the unresolved Thorium
lines. The coeﬃcients can be found in Appendix A.

Figure 4 shows the resolution map (orders versus pixels) for
the high-resolution mode using the 1x1 binning. As described in
Pepe et al. (2021) and due to the high resolution of ESPRESSO
combined with the large collecting area of the VLT, a pupil slicer
is used to reduce the spectrograph size. Therefore, each physical
order is duplicated on the detectors into two slices. The dots are
the measured resolution on the unresolved thorium lines, while
the background map is the ﬁt applied to those lines. The blue
detector corresponds to slices from 0 to 89, while the red de-
tector is for slices 90 to 169. The median resolution is about
138000, but variations are visible between both detectors. The
red detector has a higher resolution than the blue one globally
but shows some variations toward the bottom left edge. The res-
olution of the blue detector decreases toward the top left and bot-
tom right edges. Those variations reﬂect the instrumental LSF
but also opto-mechanic adjustments applied to the detectors. It
is also important to note that there is some spectral overlap be-
tween consecutive orders, and thus the right edge of one order
probes the same wavelength as the left part of the order above it.
In other terms, one wavelength can be present in two consecu-
tive orders (four slices) with diﬀerent ﬂux values, but also with
diﬀerent resolutions.

3. Telluric model ﬁt to ESPRESSO data

The algorithm developed to automatically correct the telluric
lines consists of adjusting a minimal number of parameters able
to describe the spectra in a short computation time3. To do so,

3.1. Impact of line proﬁle

It is essential to assess the impact of the line proﬁle and to se-
lect the one that best models the data with the fewest parameters.
The ﬁtted parameters are T and IWVLOS for the Gaussian pro-
ﬁle (Eq. 9), and T , Pmean, and IWVLOS for both the Lorentzian
(Eq. 11) and Voigt (Section 2.1.3) proﬁles.

Figure 5 compares the normalized master observed telluric
CCF obtained with the subset of telluric lines (in blue) to the
master modeled telluric CCFs based on the three diﬀerent pro-
ﬁles studied. The Gaussian proﬁle is not able to reproduce the
observed average water telluric line because it does not account
for the pressure broadening. The two other models reproduce the
data well, with residuals below the 2% P2V amplitude (the resid-
ual shape is discussed in Sect. 4.1). This threshold of 2 % P2V
will be used to assess the data correction quality in the follow-
ing tests. This choice represents the threshold for micro-telluric
lines that are not historically masked by the DRS of HARPS or
ESPRESSO. In the case of water vapor, the contribution of the
Gaussian proﬁle in the Voigt proﬁle is negligible, and to follow
Occam’s razor principle, the Lorentzian proﬁle was selected as
it is the simplest one.

the data.
Top panel: CCFs computed over the 20 strongest water lines.
The blue CCF is the master observed telluric CCF based on
ESPRESSO data, while the orange, green, and red CCFs are the
master modeled telluric CCFs assuming Gaussian, Lorentzian,
or Voigt proﬁles, respectively. Bottom panel: Residuals only for
the Lorentzian and Voigt proﬁles. The Gaussian proﬁle is not
shown due to its larger residuals.

3.2. Impact of the temperature

Figure 6 (top panel) shows the impact of the temperature on the
Lorentzian line shape, while Pmean and IWV are respectively
ﬁxed to half the ground pressure and IWVLOS . The temperature
was set at the lowest (273 K), the median (282 K), and the high-
est (293 K) temperatures registered since the start of ESPRESSO
operations. The temperature does not have any impact on the line

the parameters are adjusted on an average telluric line through
a CCF, which works as a de facto average line. The use of the
CCF has the advantage of reducing stellar contamination, which
leads to a more robust determination of the telluric parameters.
The produced average line is speciﬁc to each molecule and is
built over what we refer to hereafter as the subset of telluric
lines. The subset is built such that it consists of the strongest
unsaturated lines in a deﬁned wavelength range and such that
no lines are closer than 80 km · s−1 to each other. In the case of
H2O in the spectral range of ESPRESSO, we consider the subset
to be composed of the 20 strongest lines (see Appendix B)
after excluding the lines at 7186.51, 7208.41, and 7236.72 Å,
which are removed as they can be saturated depending on the
atmospheric water content.

The algorithm starts by identifying the orders or slices (with
a spectral coverage reduced by 160 km · s−1 on each edge4)
where the subset of telluric lines falls. In the case of water va-
por for ESPRESSO, the orders are 77 and 78 (slices 154, 155,
156, and 157). For each order or slice, the HITRAN parameters
are extracted for the lines of the subset present in the wavelength
range and for all lines in a passband of 80 km · s−1 around them.
Then, the telluric spectrum is computed as in Sect. 2. The next
step consists in computing the CCF with a telluric binary mask
covering the wavelength range. The mask is composed of the
subset of telluric lines, for which their weight is ﬁxed to one.
The CCF is computed over both the observed stellar spectrum
and the telluric model, afterward called observed and modeled
telluric CCFs. These observed and modeled telluric CCFs are
co-added over the selected orders or slices to obtain a master ob-
served telluric CCF and a master modeled telluric CCF. Both
CCFs are then normalized by their continuum. A Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm is then applied to minimize the residuals
between the normalized master observed telluric CCF and the
normalized master modeled telluric CCF (the free parameters
of the model are discussed below). Finally, the best-ﬁt parame-
ters are used to compute the telluric model over the full spectral
range of the observation, as in Sect. 2.

4 This is done to ensure the complete modeling of the telluric lines and
to avoid numerical issues during the computation of the CCFs.

the time of the observations.

4. Application of the telluric correction for different

spectral types

We ﬁrst performed a test on the spectrophotometric standard star,
HR 1544. As it is an A-type star, contamination by stellar lines
is negligible as only a few broad lines are present, while telluric
lines are narrower. We then tested the telluric correction for other
spectral types up to late-type stars to see if the presence of stellar
lines biases the telluric correction.

4.1. HR 1544

HR 1544 is an A-type star and is part of the spectrophotometric
standard catalog of ESO for ESPRESSO. We selected a spec-
trum at a high S/N (∼350) with an integrated water vapor of
3.56 mm measured at the zenith by one of the radiometers in-
stalled on Paranal (Kerber et al. 2012), which is above the me-
dian value of 2 mm5. Figure 7 shows this spectrum around the
subset of lines selected to perform the optimization of the pa-
rameters before and after applying the telluric correction, as well
as the computed telluric spectrum. The selected lines acquired
under this weather condition have an absorption depth ranging
from 50 to 80%. Some systematic residuals are present after the
telluric correction around the deepest lines but with a decreas-
ing residual amplitude for the weakest telluric lines. The lines
shown are the strongest in the ESPRESSO spectral band, except
for the lines at 7186.51, 7208.41, and 7236.72 Å. Figure 8 dis-
plays them alongside their strong residuals. We note that their
residuals have diﬀerent structures from one line to another and
that it was not possible to properly model them, leading to their
exclusion. The lack of proper modeling due to (quasi-)saturation
can be explained by several factors. First, the one-layer model
described here is too simple for strong telluric lines. For exam-
ple, asymmetric broadening could introduce P-Cygni-like pro-
ﬁles. Secondly, some physics of the lines is missing to repro-
duce their core. It could come from the inclusion of wind that
shifts the line core, or some HITRAN parameters that are in-
accurate. Finally, it could be a systematic error caused by the
noncommutativity of multiplication and convolution, which can
be signiﬁcant for deep telluric lines.

We used the subset of selected lines shown in Fig. 7 to cre-
ate the master observed telluric CCF, the master modeled telluric
CCF, and the master observed telluric-corrected CCF shown in
Fig 9. They represent the average line proﬁle in the 80 km · s−1
surrounding each of the selected lines. One can see that the
Levenberg-Marquardt minimization converges to residuals be-
low the 2% P2V amplitude on the average line. The latest value
is in agreement with typical telluric correction from the litera-
ture (e.g., Sameshima et al. 2018; Ulmer-Moll et al. 2019; Baker
et al. 2020).

4.2. From F-type stars to K-type stars

Figure 9 also shows the observed telluric CCF, the master mod-
eled telluric CCF, and the master observed telluric-corrected
CCF for WASP-76, WASP-127, and GJ 9827, which are F-, G-
, and K-type stars, respectively. The three stars are part of the
observations of the ESPRESSO consortium with an individual
S/N of ∼130 and with an IWV of 0.7, 7, and 5 mm respectively.
It is noticeable that the IWV not only plays an important role
in the absorption line, as expected, but it also leads to stronger

on the telluric line shape. Top: Master modeled telluric CCF

3.3. Impact of the pressure

Figure 6 (middle panel) shows the impact of the pressure on the
Lorentzian line shape, while T and IWV are respectively ﬁxed
to the ground temperature and IWVLOS . The pressure was set to
the ground pressure, half of the ground pressure, and twice the
ground pressure. When the pressure decreases, the line shape is
narrower and deeper. Contrary to the temperature, the pressure
plays an important role in the line shape and the algorithm ﬁts it.

3.4. Impact of the integrated water vapor

Figure 6 (bottom panel) shows the impact of the IWV on the
Lorentzian line shape, while T and Pmean are respectively ﬁxed
to the ground temperature and half the ground pressure. The IWV
was scaled according to airmass, IWVLOS , half of IWVLOS , and
twice IWVLOS . When the water content increases, the line is
deeper. The IWV aﬀects the line as a scaling factor, and it is
thus necessary to ﬁt it.

residuals in the very core of telluric lines. Nonetheless, the resid-
uals are within or close to the 2% P2V amplitude and in agree-
ment with the continuum dispersion. The later type stars have
more and stronger stellar lines that slightly aﬀect the CCF con-
tinuum, such as at ∼30 km · s−1 for WASP-127 or ∼25 km · s−1
for GJ 9827, but do not prevent the recovery of the water line
proﬁle and the correction of telluric contamination.

4.3. The case of M-type stars

M-type stars are rich in molecular bands in their visible spec-
trum, causing absorption of the stellar continuum to an extent
that what we measure is de facto a pseudo-continuum. It is thus

challenging to disentangle stellar and telluric lines. Figure 9 also
includes the observed telluric CCF, the master modeled telluric
CCF, and the master observed telluric-corrected CCF for GJ 436
and Proxima, which are M2 and M5-type stars, respectively. It
is not possible to discriminate between a telluric residual and
the dispersion of the pseudo-continuum in the master observed
telluric-corrected CCF. The spectrum of GJ 436 was obtained
in extreme conditions with an IWV of 12 mm, leading to an
absorption depth of about 90%, and thus a low S/N in the
telluric line cores. On the contrary, the spectrum of Proxima was
obtained under dry conditions with an IWV of 0.3 mm, leading
to a telluric correction at the level of the pseudo-continuum

dispersion.

From these examples, it is possible to conclude that the tel-
luric model presented here can be applied automatically to all
observations of ESPRESSO6, and it is not biased by the stellar
spectrum and contamination between stellar and telluric lines.
Nonetheless, some telluric residuals can be present in the core
of the strongest lines but over a very narrow spectral range in
comparison to the whole spectral domain impacted by water va-
por telluric lines.

5. Application of the telluric correction for radial ve-

locity

To assess the impact of the telluric correction on the RVs ob-
tained with ESPRESSO, we corrected the spectra of Tau Ceti and
Proxima from telluric contamination by dividing each spectrum
by its best-ﬁt telluric template. Then, the spectra were cross-
correlated with the DRS masks as the data without telluric cor-
rection. The next step was to see if a broader spectral coverage
could be used.
It is essential to understand how ESPRESSO stellar masks are
built. Each mask corresponds to a given spectral type (or sub
spectral type for M dwarfs) but they are not speciﬁc to a given
star. The masks are built from high S/N spectra of inactive stars
observed with ESPRESSO. Firstly, the line locations are identi-
ﬁed by searching for local minima. Then, spectral regions af-
fected by magnetic activity stellar lines (such as Ca ii H & K,
Na, and H-α) and by strong telluric bands (5871-6005 Å, 6271-

6 Tests on QSO spectra have to be performed but we expect the correc-
tion to perform equally good.

6341 Å, 6449-6605 Å, 6861-7416 Å, 7588-7751 Å, and 7860-
8000 Å) are excluded. As the masks need to be the same, inde-
pendently of the star or epoch of the year, margins of 64 km·s−1
(1.5 Å at 7010 Å) for active stellar lines and 214 km·s−1 (5 Å
at 7010 Å) for telluric bands, to include systemic velocity and
barycentric shifts, are excluded.
Therefore, to understand how the telluric correction could help
to reduce these excluded regions, we produced new masks based
on telluric-free spectra for Tau Ceti and Proxima. Then, we mod-
iﬁed the exclusion regions as deﬁned by the mask in diﬀerent
steps to understand how the new spectral regions modify the RV
time series. The diﬀerent RV time series produced for each star
are named DRS, Microtell, Blue, Orders77_78, Orders77,
15_Slines, 1_Sline, and Ideal. The associated masks aer
shown in Figs. C.1 and C.2.

DRS is the standard RV time serie with no telluric correction
and no modiﬁcation of the mask. It is important to note that this
is not necessarily the best mask as, for example, micro-telluric
lines can have an impact on the shape of the CCF.
Microtell is the RV time serie obtained with the data corrected
for the telluric lines but using the same mask as DRS. These
data show the impact of micro-telluric lines on the shape of the
CCFs, and therefore on the extracted RVs.
Blue is the RV time serie obtained with the data corrected for
the telluric lines but the mask includes the wavelength regions
with the telluric water bands around the Na and H-α lines, and
the reddest water band.
Orders77_78 is the RV time serie obtained with the data cor-
rected for the telluric lines but the mask includes the wavelength
regions with all the telluric water bands. It is important to note,
however, that both orders 77 and 78 (slices 154, 155, 156, and
157), where water telluric lines are the strongest, and regions

containing O2 lines are still excluded, as in the standard mask.
Orders77 is the RV time serie obtained with the data corrected
for the telluric lines and the mask includes the wavelength
regions with all the telluric water bands, but the physical order
77 (slices 154, 155) is still excluded in addition to the oxygen
bands.
15_Slines is the RV time serie obtained with the data corrected
for the telluric lines and the mask includes the wavelength re-
gions with all the telluric water bands except the 15 strongest
water lines with an exclusion window of 214 km·s−1.
1_Sline is the RV time serie obtained with the data corrected
for the telluric lines and the mask includes the wavelength
regions with all the telluric water bands except the strongest
water line at 7186.51 Å with an exclusion window of 214 km·s−1
around each line.
Ideal is the RV time serie obtained with the data corrected for
the telluric lines and the mask includes the wavelength regions
with all the telluric water bands. It corresponds to the mask that
should be used if there were no telluric water lines or if their
correction was assumed to be perfect (i.e., aﬀecting the photon
noise without introducing systematic in the RVs).

We also note that ESPRESSO had several technical interven-
tions introducing possible oﬀsets at 2458662 and 2459202 BJD
(Faria et al. 2022).

5.1. Tau Ceti
Tau Ceti (V-mag=3.5) is one of the most studied stars and has
been heavily observed by high-precision RV campaigns with
HARPS and now ESPRESSO (e.g., Dumusque et al. 2011; Feng
et al. 2017). Between July 2018 and December 2022, 1982 data
points across 202 nights were acquired with ESPRESSO. The
observational strategy for Tau Ceti consists in taking several
very short exposures per night. Therefore, the results presented
below are nightly binned. Tau Ceti RVs are known to be highly
stable with no clear sign of activity nor any massive planets
(more massive than super-Earths). It is thus a perfect target for
studying the impact of the telluric correction.

Figure 10 shows the best-ﬁt parameters of IWV and pressure
with the corresponding chi-square for Tau Ceti. Our computed
IWV values are in agreement with the radiometer values, and
the slight diﬀerences (rms of the diﬀerence is ∼0.4 mm) can be
explained by diﬀerent water column distributions between the
line of sight and the zenith. The derived pressure varies from
half of the ground pressure up to the ground pressure7, with sea-
sonal variations. Finally, we note that the quality of the ﬁts is
stable over time, conﬁrming the capability of our technique to be
applied automatically. Figure 11 shows the diﬀerence between
the RV time series obtained with the diﬀerent masks after the
telluric correction is applied, and the RV time series obtained
with the DRS. One can see that the Microtell RV time series
has some systematic diﬀerences in comparison to the DRS RV
time series. These variations are due to the presence of micro-
telluric lines that induce RV variations of about 58 cm·s−1 from
P2V with an rms of 10 cm·s−1. When phased as a function of the
BERV, the residuals also show a periodic contribution (Fig. 12)
as expected by the Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun. The
same structures are also present with the other masks. We con-
ﬁrmed the micro-telluric contribution by computing the RVs for
the DRS and Microtell RV time series in the spectral range

from 4950-5855 Å, where the micro-telluric lines are located
(see Fig. 1). We observed the exact same systematics but with
an ampliﬁed signal up to 1.4 m·s−1. It is thus proof that Tau Ceti
spectra are impacted by micro-telluric contamination. Moreover,
the Order77, 15_Slines, 1_Sline, and Ideal RV time series
have increasing systematics when a broader spectral range is in-
cluded. They are probably due to telluric residuals around the
7250 Å water band. The large diﬀerence between the 1_Sline
and Ideal RV time series is caused by a single telluric line
residual (at 7186.51 Å). This shows how important it is to ex-
clude telluric lines or to be very conﬁdent in the level of cor-
rection achievable. We also note an RV oﬀset for the last epoch
of observations after 2459202 BJD, which coincides with a tech-
nical intervention as mentioned earlier. To conclude, the mask
Orders77_78 is selected for G-type stars, such as Tau Ceti, as
it is a good trade-oﬀ between reducing bias from telluric residu-
als and the gain in photon noise (∼2 %, Table 1). The slight gain
in photon noise is caused by the blackbody maximum position
at blue wavelengths for G-type stars, where few spectral regions
are excluded.

5.2. Proxima

Proxima is also one of the most studied stars and has been heav-
ily observed by high-precision RV campaigns with HARPS and
ESPRESSO. Proxima is the closest star to the Sun and is orbited
by an Earth-like planet at a period of 11 days (Anglada-Escudé
et al. 2016), and by a planet candidate at a large orbital distance
(Damasso et al. 2020). Between February 2019 and August
2021, 117 data points were acquired and led to the independent
conﬁrmation of Proxima b by ESPRESSO (Suárez Mascareño
et al. 2020), and the detection of Proxima d at an orbital period
of 5.12 days (Faria et al. 2022). As the star is an M5 dwarf,
its spectral energy distribution peaks toward red wavelengths,
where the strongest telluric lines are located. Therefore, it is a
perfect target for verifying if the telluric correction can lead to
improved precision by including more stellar lines in the CCFs.

Figure 13 shows the best-ﬁt parameters of IWV and pres-
sure with the corresponding chi-square for Proxima. We con-
ﬁrm the same behaviors for the IWV (rms of the diﬀerence is
∼0.7 mm), the pressure, and the ﬁt goodness as for Tau Ceti. Fig-
ure 14 shows the diﬀerence between the RV time series obtained
with the diﬀerent masks after the telluric correction is applied,
and the RV time series obtained with the DRS. One can see that
the Microtell and Blue RV time series are similar to the DRS
RV time series. This is expected as the micro-telluric lines and
the spectral range gained with the Blue mask are in the blue part
of the ESPRESSO range, where there is very little ﬂux for a star

On the contrary, reaching the same photon noise as the DRS RVs
(28 cm·s−1) is equivalent to a gain of 44 % in exposure time on
the Orders77_78 RVs. To conclude on the mask selection, the
best mask to use for Proxima is Orders77_78.

5.3. Impact on the parameters of Proxima b and d

To better understand the impact of the telluric correction on the
RV delivered by the ESPRESSO DRS, we measured the impact
of the telluric correction on the CCFs for the recovered orbital
parameters of Proxima b and d, considering the same model
used in Faria et al. (2022). We compared the standard RVs pro-
duced by the DRS (hereafter referred to as DRS RVs) to the RVs
computed with the Orders77_78 mask on the telluric-corrected
spectra (hereafter referred to as telluric-corrected RVs). This
analysis simultaneously models the RV and FWHM of the CCFs,
to constrain the component of the RV signal that is caused by
stellar activity. We consider a Gaussian process (GP) with shared
hyperparameters between the RVs and FWHM, with the excep-
tion of the amplitudes. In the RVs, the model further assumes
two Keplerian signals. Following Faria et al. (2022), we subdi-
vide the ESPRESSO data set into three subsets, ESP18, ESP19,
and ESP21, and we consider possible RV oﬀsets between these
subsets. All priors are the same as those considered in Faria et al.
(2022).

The two signals with periods of 11.19 and 5.12 days are
recovered with very high signiﬁcance in the telluric-corrected
RVs. When compared to the DRS RVs, the constraints on
the orbital parameters of Proxima b are similar, but the semi-
amplitude and eccentricity of Proxima d are found to be smaller,
although within 1 sigma (Table 3). This decrease goes in the
same direction as the result obtained with the template-matching
RVs analyzed by Faria et al. (2022), which uses the real RV
content of each line but masks the telluric lines. We do not
perform a direct comparison between the telluric-corrected CCF
RVs and the template-matching RVs as the gain in photon noise
and increase in parameters constraints arise from two diﬀerent
aspects8.

Considering the maximum-likelihood solution, the rms of
the RV residuals reaches 34 cm · s−1 in the telluric-corrected
RVs, compared to about 40 cm · s−1 in the DRS RVs. This
improvement is also visible in each individual subset of the
ESPRESSO data (Table 4).

8 We also note that the template-matching analysis of Faria et al.
(2022) provides the most constrained parameter values for the Proxima
system.

such as Proxima. The Orders77_78 RV time series diﬀers from
the DRS RV time series by an oﬀset for the RVs obtained after
2458650 BJD but no systematics are introduced. This RV oﬀset
coincides with a technical intervention on ESPRESSO. On the
contrary, Order77, 15_Slines, 1_Sline, and Ideal RV time
series have clear systematics compared to the DRS RV time se-
ries, which increase when a greater spectral range is included.
Even if the DRS time series is not the reference, introducing sys-
tematics up to 4 m·s−1 is not acceptable. Therefore, the telluric
correction is not good enough in the core of the 7200 Å water
band for it to be used for precise RV studies. Nonetheless, from
Table 2, the gain in photon noise between the time series DRS
and Orders77_78 is about 25 %, while the gain between the
time series Orders77_78 and Ideal is negligible. This factor
of 1.33 in photon noise between 28 and 21 cm·s−1 corresponds
to a factor of 1.78 in exposure time. In other words, using the
Orders77_78 RVs is equivalent to increasing the exposure time

Another comparison, which tries to include the full infor-
mation in the posterior distributions, uses the so-called informa-
tion, a measure of how much the prior is compressed to reach
the posterior. Since the priors are the same in the analysis of
the telluric-corrected RVs and DRS RVs, a larger compression
means that the data provide more constraints on the model pa-
rameters. We obtain a value for the information of I=61 nats9 for
the telluric-corrected RVs and I=59 nats for the DRS RVs. Al-
though the values are close, they again reﬂect the improvement
coming from using the telluric-corrected RVs.

6. Application to the O2 molecular bands

The optical part of the telluric spectrum, in addition to the water
bands discussed above, is dominated by four oxygen bands: δ
(∼579 nm), γ (∼629 nm), B (∼688 nm) and A (∼765 nm). From
Fig. 1, one can see that the B- and A-bands are dominated by
saturated lines. There is no gain in correcting saturated or nearly
saturated lines, which have an absorption depth above 90%.
Therefore, we consider continuing to mask these two bands
for RV purposes but applying our telluric model to the γ-band,
where the gain in spectral coverage, and thus RV content, is
nonzero.

The physical parameters for 16O2 are from HITRAN (Roth-
man et al. 2013; Gordon et al. 2017). We found that a Lorentzian
proﬁle was not suﬃcient to accurately model the oxygen lines,
whereas a Voigt proﬁle with a free thermal broadening for the
line core was more eﬃcient. As opposed to water vapor, oxy-
gen is present higher up in the Earth’s atmosphere, where the
pressure broadening becomes negligible. We therefore added the
temperature to the integrated oxygen column density and pres-
sure, as a free parameter in the minimization ﬁt. Equation 5 can
thus be modiﬁed as follows:

T (ν) = e−IOCLOS ·nO2

·(cid:80) σ(ν),

(17)

= 5.65 · 1018 molecules · cm−3 and IOC is the
where nO2
integrated oxygen column density at the zenith, and is about
7 km. On the contrary to the IWV, the IOCLOS varies mainly as
a function of the airmass. This correlation explains the strong
dependence of the RVs that are measured on O2 lines on the
airmass measured with HARPS (Figueira et al. 2010).

Figure 16 shows the master observed telluric CCF, the master
modeled telluric CCF, and the master observed telluric-corrected
CCF, all obtained with the subset of O2 lines in the γ-band for
HR 1544 and Proxima. In both cases, telluric residuals are below
the 2% P2V amplitude or within the continuum dispersion as
in the case of water lines. This proves that the telluric model
described here can be applied to diﬀerent molecules.

7. Conclusion

The telluric correction presented here is based on a simple
line-by-line telluric model, which requires the physical param-
eters of the lines (e.g., from the HITRAN database (Rothman
et al. 2013)), the sky conditions, and a detailed map of the
instrument’s spectral resolution as a function of the position on
the detector. Then, the model is adjusted to the observations
through a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization by building an
average line proﬁle over a subset of selected lines with strong
absorptions.

While this model can be applied to any molecules, our fo-
cus in this paper is the study of H2O lines in the spectral
range of ESPRESSO (3800-7800 Å). The water vapor lines
are best represented by Lorentzian proﬁles, which are mainly
dominated by the integrated water vapor that controls the line
strength, but also by the pressure that controls the line width.
We demonstrated that the telluric correction works for all stellar
spectral
types with residuals below a 2 % P2V amplitude.
Similar performances have been obtained with other methods
(e.g., Artigau et al. 2014; Smette et al. 2015; Ulmer-Moll et al.
2019; Leet et al. 2019; Bedell et al. 2019; Cretignier et al.
2021), but our model does not require a telluric database, can be
directly applied to a single observation, and is simple enough to
be implemented in the DRS of state-of-the-art spectrographs to
deliver high-ﬁdelity spectra and RVs.
Telluric lines with absorption depths greater than 70-80%
exhibit residual structures with P-Cygni-like proﬁles. Several
reasons can explain these structures, such as a lack of sophis-
tication in our one-layer model (even if more complex models
show similar results (Smette et al. 2015; Allart et al. 2020)),
inexact parameters in the HITRAN database, the presence of
additional phenomena that deformed the line shape (e.g. winds),
or systematic errors due to the noncommutative arithmetic
between convolution and division. We note that Earth scientists
use more complex line shapes to model the telluric lines but
the level of complexity and number of parameters to take into
account are incompatible with the simplicity that we aimed for
here.

The main goal of this telluric correction is to provide more
precise RVs, unbiased by micro-telluric lines (Cunha et al.
2013). The example of Tau Ceti showcased that micro-telluric
lines can introduce systematics up to 58 cm·s−1 P2V with an
rms of 10 cm·s−1. It is therefore critical to properly correct them
when searching for Earth-mass planets. We also compared the
RVs produced by the standard masks of the ESPRESSO DRS
with diﬀerent custom masks, testing the impact of the inclusion
of a larger spectral region. To stick to the original idea of the
ESPRESSO DRS, we kept these masks independent of the
BERV and systemic velocities of the stars. Our best custom
mask, Orders77_78, while excluding orders 77 and 78 (where
a couple of telluric water lines still have strong residuals),
enables a gain of ∼500 Å (only ∼14% of the spectral range is
then excluded, compared to ∼27% with the DRS mask) without

introducing systematics. In the case of Proxima, this additional
wavelength coverage leads to a gain of 25 % in photon noise or
a factor of 1.78 in exposure time. This can lead to the detection
of fainter RV signals but also a more eﬃcient use of telescope
time.

We applied the same analysis as Faria et al. (2022) to the
telluric-corrected CCF RVs of Proxima and we conﬁrmed
the presence of the planet Proxima b and planet candidate
Proxima d. While the parameters of Proxima b are similar in
both analyses, the semi-amplitude and eccentricity of Proxima
d are smaller and their distributions go in the direction of
the template matching analysis. Although the improvements
brought by those two techniques converge to similar results for
the parameters of planet candidate d, we want to note that those
two methods do optimize completely diﬀerent things. On one
side, template matching uses the real RV content of each line
and the most RV information possible, as in M dwarfs there is
RV information everywhere, even in the pseudo-continuum. On
the other side, the method proposed in this paper corrects for
telluric absorption, and therefore a gain in RV information that
leads to a better estimation of the planetary signal. We also want
to note that improvements in the deﬁnition of the weights of
each stellar line for the CCF technique are underway (Bourrier
et al. 2021).

We extended the application of our correction to the O2 γ-
band to display that our model can correct the telluric lines of
molecules other than H2O. In the case of the γ-band, the telluric
residuals are within the requirements to perform extremely
precise RV measurements, even if the spectral range freed
remains modest (∼80 Å).

Adapting the model
to other instruments, such as HARPS
and HARPS-N instruments, will lead to a substantial increase in
RV content. A gain in photon noise of 10 % could be reached for
M5-type stars, and a ∼60 cm·s−1 P2V micro-telluric amplitude
could be removed. Furthermore, near-infrared high-resolution
spectrographs, such as NIRPS, are the most important spec-
tographs for applying a well-functioning telluric correction. At
these wavelengths, H2O is not the only main absorber, and CO2,
O2, and CH4 absorb on large spectral ranges, and with deep
lines. It is, therefore, critical to optimize the telluric correction
to facilitate the maximum extraction of RV information.

The impact of the telluric correction for all the stars observed
by the ESPRESSO consortium still needs to be investigated
in detail but we expect that it will lead to more precise and
less biased discoveries. The impact on other science cases,
such as stellar activity indicators, atmospheric characterization,
or the measurement of the ﬁne structure constant, still has to
be studied. Removing micro-telluric lines is potentially very
important for measurements of the ﬁne structure constant
with ESPRESSO: micro-telluric lines which fall on top of
the relevant transitions in the quasar spectrum could spoil the
measurement if not removed or recognized. Therefore, we can
be optimistic regarding the beneﬁts of applying our correction
methods to diﬀerent science cases.

Fig. 15: Posterior distributions for the orbital period, semi-
amplitude, and eccentricity of the 11-day (top) and 5-day (bot-
tom) signals. The dashed blue histograms correspond to the anal-
ysis of the DRS RVs, while the red histograms correspond to the
analysis of the telluric-corrected RVs (TEL).

Fig. 16: Master observed telluric CCF (in black), master mod-
eled telluric CCF (in red, dashed) and master observed telluric-
corrected CCF (in gray) for HR 1544 (top) and Proxima (bot-
tom). The CCFs are performed over the subset of selected O2
lines in the γ-band. The two horizontal blue dotted lines encom-
pass the 2% residual P2V.
