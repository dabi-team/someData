Abstract—Terahertz (THz) communication and the application
of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology
for the sixth generation (6G)
have been proved signiﬁcant
communication systems, and have gained global
interests. In
this paper, we employ the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR)
method integrated with acceleration technology to model THz
and massive MIMO channel. The results of ray tracing (RT)
simulation in this paper, i.e., angle of departure (AoD), angle of
arrival (AoA), and power delay proﬁle (PDP) under the frequency
band supported by the commercial RT software Wireless Insite
(WI) are in agreement with those produced by WI. Based on the
Kirchhoff scattering effect on material surfaces and atmospheric
absorption loss showing at THz frequency band, the modiﬁed
propagation models of Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients and free-
space attenuation are consistent with the measured results. For
massive MIMO, the channel capacity and the stochastic power
distribution are analyzed. The results indicate the applicability
of SBR method for building deterministic models of THz and
massive MIMO channels with extensive functions and acceptable
accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

The incoming 6G technology characterizes wider ranges of
application scenarios, with transmission rates and communi-
cation quality rising signiﬁcantly [1]–[4]. Thus, an accurate
channels model
incorporating new technologies like THz
communication and massive MIMO is indispensable to meet
the requirements in 6G design and deployment.

In [5], the RT based deterministic modeling was introduced
as a perfect candidate for wireless channel prediction. The
two most commonly adopted approaches for RT are the image
method (IM) and the SBR method. The IM method can trace
the ray with high efﬁciency while being time-consuming. By
contrast, the SBR method can trace multiple rays simultaneous
with width ﬁrst search algorithm, therefore featuring lower
computational complexity and better extensions [6]. These
advantages make it more versatile and efﬁcient in complex
simulations.

In [6]–[9], THz and massive MIMO were proved to be
prospective solutions to increase transmission rate. THz fea-
tures ultra-high transmission rate with larger channel band-
width available. In [7], the Kirchhoff scattering theory was
introduced to revise the diffusion of rays in THz band.
In [8], attenuation and dispersion of atmosphere during the
propagation of rays in THz channels were proved to be
signiﬁcant. Massive MIMO improved channel capacity and
spectral efﬁciency, while it features the characteristics of
near-ﬁeld spherical wavefront when the distance between the
transmitting and receiving antennas or a cluster are probably
within the Rayleigh distance [9]. Under such circumstances,
the simulation and calculation methods of MIMO channels
need to be modiﬁed accordingly.

Recently,

the most common approach to model high-
frequency channels and massive MIMO channels is the geom-
etry based stochastic model (GBSM), which is versatile but
requires tremendous channel measurement, as well as being
less accurate in speciﬁc scenarios than RT method [10]–[11].
WI, the most popular commercial RT software recently, is also
limited in the simulation of high frequency channels and it
only supports the band between 50MHz to 100GHz. So in
this paper the SBR method is adopted to perform THz and
MIMO channel simulation, and the application of RT method
in channel simulation can also be easily extended as a result
of that.

This paper focuses on the SBR based THz and massive
MIMO channel modeling, and it innovatively combines THz
correction with the SBR simulation structure, as well as
verifying several important properties of massive MIMO with
the SBR method. The atmospheric absorption and Kirchhoff
scattering effect at THz band are considered and MIMO arrays
are equipped at both transmitter and receiver sides of the
channels. The simulation system is set up based on MATLAB
and is to be extended into an integrated RT module for 6G
channels in the future.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II

THz band and massive MIMO channels. Section III describes
the implement on MATLAB of the proposed channel model.
In Section IV we present the simulation and analysis results.
The conclusions are drawn in Section V.

II. SBR BASED CHANNEL MODELING FOR THZ
BAND

A. SBR method based forward RT and calculation

The SBR method is employed in the simulation, whose
i.e., ray launching, ray

procedure consists of four steps,
tracing, ray reception, and ray calculation [5].

1) Ray launching: Previous works have demonstrated the
effectiveness of icosahedron ray-sampling method, where an
icosahedron is created to assist in the launch of rays. This
method, illustrated in Fig. 1, characterizes the uniformity of
launched rays’ distribution as well as provides signiﬁcant
topological information about different rays launched.

2) Ray tracing: In this step, each ray is tracked at the given
propagation mechanisms (the permitted times of reﬂection,
diffraction, scattering, etc.) according to Snell’s law and ER
theory as it propagates through geometric scenarios, and the
different propagation mechanisms are illustrated vividly in
Fig. 2. Simultaneously, the rays will experience various power
losses during their propagation in the scenarios. At the same
time, RT trees are established to store and arrange for the
propagation of ray cones, and then pick out effective paths for
the next step in II-A3.

3) Ray reception: Effective paths selected in the last step in
II-A2 are tested to determine whether the wavefront intersects
the receiving antenna. Reception spheres in Fig. 3 are used to
model this process where the radius of spheres is determined
by the distance between the signal transmitter and receiver,
representing the cross section of ray cones. If a center ray
the cone it represents will
intersects the receiver sphere,
contribute for the total electric ﬁeld of the receiver.

4) Ray calculation: With Maxwell equations in time-
harmonic electromagnetic ﬁelds, the electric ﬁeld ~Erθ,ϕ,i of

the i-th received ray is calculated according to the propagation
record of it, which can be demonstrated by [3]

are the coefﬁcients of the j-th reﬂection, k-th scattering,
and l-th diffraction, respectively. Aθ,ϕ,l (s′, s) represents the
attenuation function.

In massive MIMO channel, electric ﬁelds need be combined
coherently with phase. The total electric ﬁeld received at
one certain receiving point ~Erθ,ϕ is accumulated by ~Erθ,ϕ,i
according to the linear nature of Maxwell equations, which
can be calculated as

where rT E/T M stands for the original Fresnel reﬂection
coefﬁcients under TE/M polarization, while r′

modiﬁed ones at THz band.

2) The attenuation and dispersion of atmosphere: At THz
band,
the molecular absorption effect of water vapor and
oxygen is non-negligible. Thus, we adopt an algorithm to
calculate atmospheric attenuation and dispersion. The speciﬁc
atmospheric attenuation is given by [10]

where ϕo and ϕw stand for speciﬁc phase dispersion of them.
N ′(f ) is the real part of complex refractive index for oxygen
and water vapor.

C. The characteristics of wireless channels in massive MIMO
scenarios

At the working frequency band of RT method, the size of
antenna can normally be ignored compared to the scenario.
The antenna matrix of MIMO system constructed in uniform
planar array (UPA) or uniform linear array (ULA) can be
simpliﬁed as a series of points, denoted as [9]

Tx = [T1 T2

Rx = [R1 R2

. . . RNr ]

(11)

(12)

where Ti(i = 1, . . . , Nt) and Rj(j = 1, . . . , Nr) are the
transmitting and receiving points in the MIMO arrays.

is commonly employed to

describe MIMO channels, and it can be

III. SIMULATION SYSTEM SETUP

A. Model preparation for simulation

Our simulation system supports 3 dimension (3-D) scenar-
ios in the formats of json (JavaScript Object Notation), stl
(stereolithography) and xml (Extensible Markup Language).
The ofﬁce scenario for this paper is modeled with sketchup
2021. The speciﬁc room dimensions are 7.2 × 7.2 × 3m3. On
one side of the wall it is equipped with two glass windows,
which cover almost the entire wall on the other side. The rest
of the walls are covered with wallpaper. The ﬂoor and celling
is made of gypsum. The transmitting and receiving point are
set at (1.46,2.42,2.41) and (5.2,5.2,1.5) respectively. The room
is presented in Fig. 4.

B. Software architecture and workﬂow

Constructed in MATLAB, our simulation system consists of
ﬁve main modules, i.e., antenna, geometry, ray tracing, paths,
and output module, which correspond to different functions.
The workﬂow of system is vividly illustrated in Fig. 5.

C. Simulation acceleration based on parallel computation

The intersection determination process in ray tracing in the
second step in II-A2 is extremely time-consuming, thus we
employ parallel computation in our system for acceleration.
Graphic processing unit (GPU) computation is especially suit-
able for RT acceleration with massive MIMO arrays [12]. We
implement kernel functions to achieve parallel computation,
encapsulating compute uniﬁed device architecture (CUDA)
C++ programs for GPU as a library to be called in MATLAB.
With GPU acceleration, we can reduce the time consumption
of massive MIMO simulations by above 81%.

IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

A. SBR ray tracing and calculation

As is introduced above, our RT simulation supports line-
of-sight (LoS) propagation as well as reﬂection, diffraction,
and scattering. Some RT simulation results are displayed in
Fig. 6 at 2.4 GHz with third order reﬂection. This frequency
band is selected because it is supported by WI. Then the ray
calculation results can be compared with those simulated with
WI, and have reached ﬁne agreements in Fig. 7 within 5.2%
error. The calculated results of channel characteristics, taking
2.4 GHz with forth order reﬂection and ﬁrst order diffraction
for example, are listed in Table I.

Such results are of great value for the design of actual com-
munication systems. The path loss helps design channels with
less energy loss, while the level of channel transmission rate
can be estimated from the simulated channel capacity. RMS
delay spread helps analyze whether the waveform expansion
will cause inter-code crosstalk and evaluate its communication
quality. The AoA and AoD can guide the beam assignment
design of antenna, which is meaningful for the deployment of
communication channel.

B. THz band simulations

1) Air attenuation and dispersion simulations: The sim-
ulation for air attenuation and dispersion is demonstrated
graphically in Fig. 8, in which the results is in good con-
sistency with the results in ITU-R documents [8]. At higher

frequencies, the molecular absorption of water vapor is dom-
inant in atmospheric interference, which grows stronger with
increasing humidity. It is easy to ﬁgure out that each curve
has absorption peaks at several speciﬁc signal frequencies,
thus it is necessary to avoid these frequencies when actually
deploying THz channels so that power wastage can be well
mitigated.

2) The Kirchhoff scattering based reﬂection modiﬁcation:
Comparison has been made between simulation and mea-
surement for modiﬁed reﬂection coefﬁcients of the wallpaper
sample in the scenario. Good agreements are found in Fig. 9
with errors generally lower than 6.5% in reﬂection coefﬁcients

terms of transmission rate improvement.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have employed SBR method to model
6G THz and massive MIMO channels in a complex indoor
scenario. Simulations were carried out with our proposed RT
system and the results have been veriﬁed by commercial
RT software WI within 5.2% error. We have modiﬁed the
calculation method of Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient according
to Kirchhoff scattering theory and the simulation results have
been proved consistent with experimental data in literatures
with an error lower than 6.5%. The atmospheric absorption
effect has also been considered to exemplify the frequency
selective fading effect at THz band. MIMO simulation module
has also been integrated in the system to analyze the capacity
improvement and spatial non-stationarity brought by MIMO.
Moreover, GPU parallel computation has been employed to
accelerate MIMO simulations and the time consumption can
be cut down to 19%. The results of our work indicate that RT
method is suitable for MIMO and THz channel model. In the
future, more experimental data for materials under THz band
