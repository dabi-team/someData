SOME INTERESTING BIRATIONAL MORPHISMS OF SMOOTH AFFINE
QUADRIC 3-FOLDS

CINZIA BISI, JONATHAN D. HAUENSTEIN, AND TUYEN TRUNG TRUONG

To the late Nessim Sibony

Abstract. We study a family of birational maps of smooth aﬃne quadric 3-folds x1x4 − x2x3 =
constant, over C, which seems to have some (among many others) interesting/unexpected char-

acters: a) they are cohomologically hyperbolic, b) their second dynamical degree is an algebraic

number but not an algebraic integer, and c) the logarithmic growth of their periodic points is strictly
smaller than their algebraic entropy. These maps are restrictions of a polynomial map on C4 pre-
serving each of the quadrics. The study in this paper is a mixture of rigorous and experimental

ones, where for the experimental study we rely on Bertini which is a reliable and fast software for

expensive numerical calculations in complex algebraic geometry.

1. Introduction

A main theme in Complex Dynamics is that of equidistribution for periodic points. Roughly
speaking, it is expected that if a rational map (more generally, meromorphic map) f : X 99K X of
a complex projective manifold (more generally, compact K¨ahler manifold) satisﬁes a certain type

of hyperbolicity, then it has an equilibrium measure with no mass on proper Zariski subsets, and

to which the average of Dirac measures on hyperbolic periodic points converges. In general, one

expects that the logarithmic growth of (hyperbolic) isolated periodic points of a map is a lower

bound for its topological entropy (a very fundamental dynamical invariant).

To make precise the above statement, we ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of dynamical degrees of a map.
Let X be a compact K¨ahler manifold of dimension m, and f : X 99K X a dominant meromorphic
X - called the indeterminacy set of f - so that f
map (i.e.: there is a proper Zariski subset I(f )

is given as a holomorphic map f : X

λj(f ). In the case X is a complex projective manifold, one can choose ω to be the class of an ample
divisor and replace H 2j(X, C) by N j
R(X) the space of algebraic cycles of codimension j (with real
coeﬃcients) modulo the numerical equivalence. λ0(f ) is always 1, while λm(f ) is the topological
degree of f (and hence is 1 when f is bimeromorphic). It is known that λj(f )’s are bimeromorphic
invariants ([32] and [31]), that is if π : Y 99K X is a bimeromorphic map, and fY is the lifting of f
to Y (i.e. fY = π−1
π), then λj(fY ) = λj(f ) for all j. There are also arithmetic analogs of these
dynamical degrees, where the above mentioned results are largely unknown, and there are many

challenging conjectures around (see [46][18]). Dynamical degrees can also be deﬁned for maps on

ﬁelds of positive characteristics [56][16], and the version for correspondence in [56] thus can be used

to provide a generalization of Weil’s Riemann hypothesis [57][44][43]. Dynamical degrees provide

a useful way to compute topological entropy of holomorphic selfmaps of compact K¨ahler manifolds

[40][60].
Inspired by this fact, for a general meromorphic map, the logarithm of the maximum
of its dynamical degrees is named its algebraic entropy in [9], and this is widely practiced in

the literature. Moreover, they provide an upper bound for the topological entropy of dominant

meromorphic maps of compact K¨ahler manifolds [32][31], and the same upper bound holds in the

Berkovich space setting [35][36]. Besides being of interest in pure mathematics, birational maps

appear naturally in some physical models (in lattice statistical mechanics), and their dynamical

degrees are an indication of the complexity of these models, see e.g. [10][9][8][2][3][55].

A dominant meromorphic map f : X 99K X is cohomologically hyperbolic if there is one index
j so that λj(f ) > maxi6=j λi(f ). Cohomological hyperbolicity is a cohomological version of the
well known notion of hyperbolic dynamics in diﬀerentiable dynamical systems, where many results

around periodic points, equilibrium measures and topological entropy are known, see a survey

in [42]. The rough idea is that since algebraic dynamical systems are more rigid than smooth

dynamical systems, hyperbolicity of an algebraic dynamical system may be detected by the easier

invariants on cohomology groups.

With this preparation, an explicit statement of a major folklore conjecture, which attracts a lot

of attention and work, is the following:

Conjecture 1.1 (Folklore Conjecture). Let X be a compact K¨ahler manifold of dimension m, and
f : X 99K X a dominant meromorphic map. Assume that f is cohomologically hyperbolic. Then
there is a bimeromorphic map π : Y 99K X from a compact K¨ahler manifold Y so that for the lifting
fY of f to Y , the following are true:

1) There is a probability measure µ on Y with no mass on proper analytic subsets (hence, one

can push it forward by fY ) which is invariant by fY , i.e. (fY )∗µ = µ.

2) Let HPn(fY ) be the set of hyperbolic periodic points of period n of fY . Then:

a) The exponential growth of ♯HPn(fY ) is λ(f ), where λ(f ) = maxj λj(f ). This means that

lim
n→∞

log ♯HPn(fY )
n

= log λ(f ).

b) The hyperbolic periodic points of f equidistribute to µ. That is,

3

lim
n→∞

Here, δx is the Dirac measure at x.

♯HPn(fY ) X

x∈HPn(fY )

δx = µ.

c) The number of other isolated periodic points of f of order n is negligible compared to that of

♯HPn(fY ).

A stronger version (which also involves the topological entropy and Lyapunov exponents) of

this conjecture was stated in [41]. A few representatives from the large known results in the

literature resolving Conjecture 1.1 in the aﬃrmative are: dimension 1 (see [14][49][38]); H´enon maps

in dimension 2 (see [4][5]); automorphisms of K3 surfaces (see [15]); birational maps of surfaces

satisfying a certain condition on Green currents (see [33], which relies on a precise estimate for the

number of isolated periodic points: the lower bound is obtained therein by using laminar currents,

and the upper bound is later provided by [45][24]); a large class of maps of surfaces satisfying an
energy condition (see [21]); meromorphic maps of compact K¨ahler manifolds for which λm > λm−1
(see [25]); and analogs of H´enon-maps in higher dimensions (see [30]). For a comprehensive survey,

see [29], where other topics of equidistribution - besides that of periodic points - are also discussed.

Despite all of these partial results and many eﬀorts, Conjecture 1.1 is still largely open.

There are some indications in the literature that Conjecture 1.1 may be too strong to be true.
For example, one related conjecture is that λ1(f ) is an algebraic number [8]. However, recent work
[7][6] shows the existence of maps (can be chosen to be birational maps of Pd where d
3) for
which λ1(f ) is a transcendental number, and hence the mentioned related conjecture does not hold.
On the other hand, it is not known if the mentioned maps in [7][6] provide counter-examples to

≥

Conjecture 1.1, because these papers treat only the ﬁrst dynamical degrees and concern neither

periodic points nor equilibrium measures.

It is noteworthy that for the various maps in the literature where dynamical degrees can be

actually computed (for a birational maps of surfaces a general procedure using point blowups has

been given in [22], but besides that one must in general treat case by case), the dynamical degrees
are either algebraic integers (i.e. roots of a polynomial p(t) whose coeﬃcients are integers and
the leading coeﬃcient is 1) or transcendental numbers (i.e. not a root of any polynomial with

integer coeﬃcients). For some special maps, there are even particular speculations about that the

dynamical degrees are algebraic integers of special types. Therefore, it is natural to ask what is

the situation for the numbers in between these two types, that is algebraic numbers which are not

algebraic integers. For example, recall that a real number λ is a Perron number if it is an algebraic

integer and any of its Galois conjugate µ satisﬁes

λ. There is the following conjecture [12]

(for the ﬁrst dynamical degree) and [17] (for all dynamical degrees), concerning the very actively

studied polynomial maps of aﬃne spaces:

Conjecture 1.2. If f : Cd
of f to Pd) are all Perron numbers (in particular, algebraic integers).

→

Cd is a polynomial map, then the dynamical degrees (of the extension

For the ﬁrst dynamical degree, the above conjecture holds in dimension 2 (see [39][34]) and some
automorphisms in C3 (see [50]), and some special automorphisms in higher dimensions ([13][12]
and an unpublished result by Mattias Jonsson cited in these papers). For proper polynomials of
Cm so that λ2
1 > λ2, [17] shows that λ1(f ) is an algebraic number of degree at most m. For all
dynamical degrees, one non-trivial case is the case of a monomial map f (see [37] [48]) where all

of its dynamical degrees are known to be the product of absolute values of some eigenvalues of the

integer matrix deﬁning f , and hence are all algebraic integers (recall that algebraic integers form a

ring).

In the case where the dynamical degrees are algebraic integers, there are three common ap-

proaches, which involves establishing a linear recurrence between the degrees of the iterates. The

ﬁrst one (for the ﬁrst dynamical degree λ1) is to observe directly a linear recurrence between the
degrees of iterates of f . The second one is to construct a birational (or bimeromorphic) map
π : Y
X for which the lifting map fY satisﬁes a so-called algebraic stability under which λj(f )
is the spectral radius of the pullback map f ∗
H j,j(Y ). (A generalization of this is
the recent work [17] which shows that the pullback map on an associated Banach space RZ(Y ) is

Y : H j,j(Y )

→

→

stable. However, unlike on the ﬁnite dimensional cohomology groups, there is no guarantee that

the eigenvalues on RZ(Y ) are algebraic integers.) Finally, the third one is to use specialities of toric

varieties and toric maps. In the case where the dynamical degree is transcendental, the method in

[7][6] is to use Diophantine approximation.

The purpose of this paper is to present a family of birational maps of smooth quadric 3-folds

which are a candidate counter-example for Conjecture 1.1. At the same time, these birational
maps come from polynomial maps on C4 whose second and third dynamical degrees seem to be
an algebraic number but not an algebraic integer (and hence, can also be a counter-example for

Conjecture 1.2). As such, the mentioned methods in the last part of the previous paragraph cannot

be used to compute the conjectured second dynamical degree, and new ideas have to be developed

for this task.

A disadvantage of the statement of Conjecture 1.1 is that some parts of it depend on an un-
speciﬁed birational map π : Y 99K X and an unspeciﬁed equilibrium measure µ. As will be seen
in Section 2, the following conjecture is a consequence of Conjecture 1.1, and concerns only the

exponential growth of the set of isolated periodic points (which in theory can be explicitly found)

and is independent of the birational model of a given map.

5

Conjecture 1.3. Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension d, and let f :
X 99K X be a dominant rational map. Assume that f is cohomologically hyperbolic. Deﬁne
λ(f ) = maxj λj(f ) and IsoP ern(f ) the set of isolated periodic points of period n of f (multiplicities
accounted). Let Z

X be any Zariski open dense set. Then

⊂

= log λ(f ).

Note that one part of the above conjecture is known [24] (valid in the K¨ahler setting, and the

proof therein uses the theory of tangent currents developed in [28]): we always have

lim sup
n→∞

(On the other hand, on diﬀerentiable dynamical systems, there are no such upper bounds on the

number of periodic points, see [47].)

Hence, to disprove Conjecture 1.1 it suﬃces to display a counter-example to Conjecture 1.3. We

next present our candidate counter-examples for Conjectures 1.3 (and hence 1.1) and 1.2, which
are strikingly simple. We start with a polynomial F : C4

The remaining of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we will explain why Conjecture 1.3 is a

consequence of Conjecture 1.1, and why an aﬃrmative answer to Conjecture 1.5 provides a counter-

example to Conjectures 1.1, 1.3 and 1.2. We then present various theoretical and experimental

results concerning Conjecture 1.5. Based on these results, we present an approach towards resolving

Conjecture 1.5 in the aﬃrmative. We then stipulate some comments/suggestions on the direction

of equidistribution for periodic points for rational and meromorphic maps.

Here is a brief summary of the idea for using experimental results reported later in this paper to

give support to the validity of Conjecture 1.5. For to check part 2 of Conjecture 1.5, we compare

is related to the log concavity phenomenon in Proposition 1.6, and to observe that for n = 4, 5
the number (♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc))1/(2n+1) is

Conjecture 1.5, we compare the two sequences (♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc))1/(2n+1) and (♯IsoF ix2n(fc))1/(2n)
and use the Weaker estimate.

2.1. Theoretical results. We ﬁrst start with some relations between Conjectures 1.1, 1.3, 1.2 and

1.5.

Lemma 2.1. 1) If Conjecture 1.1 holds, then Conjecture 1.3 holds.

2) Assume that parts 1 and 2 of Conjecture 1.5 hold.

a) If the Stronger estimate of part 3 of Conjecture 1.5 holds, then Conjecture 1.3 does not hold.

b) If the Weaker estimate of part 3 of Conjecture 1.5 holds, then Conjecture 1.1 does not hold.

3) If part 2 of Conjecture 1.5 holds, then Conjecture 1.2 does not hold.

Proof. 1) Assume that Conjecture 1.1 holds. Let f : X 99K X be a dominant rational map which
is cohomologically hyperbolic. Let π : Y 99K X be the birational map given by Conjecture 1.1.

The leading term of F (x1, x2, x3, x4) = ((F )1, (F )2, (F )3, (F )4) in terms of degree is x1x2x4 in
(F )4. Moreover, (F )3 has a unique leading monomial, and x1x2x4 is the unique leading monomial
in (F )4. By direct calculation, we ﬁnd that F 2 = ((F 2)1, (F 2)2, (F 2)3, (F 2)4) is given by:

Hence, again, the leading term of F 2 is contained in (F 2)4, and (F 2)4 has a unique leading mono-

We will prove by induction that the leading term of F n = ((F n)1, (F n)2, (F n)3, (F n)4) is con-
tained in (F n)4, and moreover (F n)4 has a unique leading monomial. In addition the concerned

Finally, we prove Proposition 1.6.

Proof of Proposition 1.6. First, we have the known fact that the cohomology groups of X come

(cid:3)

from the pullback on cohomology of the embedding ι : X ֒

P2m.

[For the convenience of the

readers, we brieﬂy recall the arguments. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, for j
pullback ι∗ : H j(P2m)
H j(X) is an isomorphism. For j
2m + 2 one can use Poincare duality
to determine the cohomology group. It remains to show that H 2m−1(X) = 0. This can be done by

2, the

computing the Euler characteristic of X, and the latter can be done by using the normal bundle

sequence and Whitney sum formula.]

In particular, this means the following: H 2j+1(X) = 0 for all j; if 2j is even and

2 then
H 2j(X) is generated by hj where h = ι∗(H) is the pullback of a hyperplane H in P2m, while the
remaining groups are computed using Poincare duality. Hence H ∗(X) is generated by h, and we
have h2m−1 = H 2m−1.X = 2.

Thus, if π1, π2 : X

From this, we get the following formula for the Lefschetz number of a map g : X

L(g) =

X

g∗(

Each of the summand in the right hand side is > 0, and hence L(g) > 0. We denote by dj(g) :=
g∗( 1

2 hj).h2m−1−j the j-th degree of g.
Now, we will show that for any two dominant rational maps g1, g2 : X 99K X, and any j

1
dj(g1)dj(g2). To this end, we follow the ideas in [52] [32] of using automorphisms
then dj(g1 ◦
of X to regularise positive closed currents. We recall that the quadric X is a homogeneous space,
whose automorphism group is the subgroup of the linear automorphisms of P2m preserving the
quadratic form. Hence, by using a convolution process with the aid of the Haar measure of the

g2)

automorphism group of X, for any positive closed (j, j) current T on X, there is a sequence of
positive closed smooth (j, j) forms Tǫ weakly converging to T so that (recall that the cohomology

Now we recall how dj(g1 ◦

choose generic algebraic varieties in X: Vj of codimension j representing the cohomology class hj

Here g1|Z is a proper map of ﬁnite ﬁbres, and hence the preimage of g1|Z of any variety is again
a variety of the same dimension. Moreover, we have the following property: If Tǫ is a sequence of
positive closed smooth forms weakly converging to the current of integration over g−1
1 (Vj)/2 and
being of the same cohomology class as that of g−1

1 (Vj)/2 (which is proven in the above), then

Remark 2.5. One can also prove Proposition 1.6 by a purely algebraic proof, which replaces

regularisation of currents by Chow’s moving lemma and which is valid on any algebraically closed

ﬁnding the periodic points are more expensive and diﬃcult than those for calculating the degree

We can see from the above two tables that, as predicted by Conjecture 1.5, the exponential growth

of the degree sequence is much larger than that of the isolated periodic points. From the table for
the degree sequence above, we can readily check that the sequence d(1)

2.3. Further analysis & A road map towards an aﬃrmative answer to Conjecture 1.5.

In this Subsection we further analyze the experimental ﬁndings in the previous Subsection, in

2.3.3. An approach to part 3 of Conjecture 1.5. We divide this into two tasks: one concerning the

Weaker estimate (which provides a counter-example to Conjecture 1.1) and one concerning the

Stronger estimate (which provides a counter-example to Conjecture 1.3).

An approach towards the Weaker estimate in part 3 of Conjecture 1.5:

From the table for the number of isolated periodic points, we ﬁnd that the sequence

[♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc)](1/2n+1) (for 0
5) is a decreasing sequence: 4, 2.15443469003, 2.13152551,
2.10967780991, 2.10744910267, and 2.10703309279. Also, we ﬁnd that the ﬁxed point set of f 2n+1
5) consists of isolated points only. These facts do not look like a random coincidence,
(for 0

and hence naturally lead to the following question:

Question 4: Is it true that the sequence [♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc)]1/(2n+1) (for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) is a

decreasing sequence?

If Question 4 has an aﬃrmative answer, then since [♯IsoF ix9]1/9 = 2.1074... < 2.108, we obtain

right away a proof of the Weaker estimate in part 3 of Conjecture 1.5.

Here is a heuristic explanation for why Question 4 can have an aﬃrmative answer: We know from
fc : Xc 99K Xc is decreasing.
c )1/n
f n
Proposition 1.6 that the Lefschetz numbers

It seems that in this special case, we can localise this property to the map fc =
fc|Zc . If this is
b
so, and if we can show that the ﬁxed point set of fc consists of only isolated points (as seen in the
experiments), then Question 4 is solved in the aﬃrmative (since then the Lefschetz number is the

for the map

L(
{

}

same as the number of ﬁxed points).

An approach towards the Stronger estimate in part 3 of Conjecture 1.5:

This part is probably more diﬃcult to establish. Our clue is that from the table we observe the fol-
[♯IsoF ix2n+2(fc)]1/2n+2.

5, we have [♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc)]1/2n+1

lowing phenomenon: for all 0

Thus comes another question:

≤

≤

Question 5:

Is it true that [♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc)]1/2n+1

0, 1, 2, . . .?

[♯IsoF ix2n+2(fc)]1/2n+2 for all n =

≥

If Question 5 has an aﬃrmative answer, and if moreover the Weaker estimate in part 3 of

Conjecture 1.5 holds, then the Stronger estimate in part 3 of Conjecture 1.5 follows readily.

Why Question 5 should have an aﬃrmative answer could be again contributed to a localisation
of Proposition 1.6. While the log concavity of the sequence IsoF ixn(fc) is violated (see the next
paragraph), still some parts could be preserved, allowing us to have aﬃrmative answers to both

Questions 4 and 5.

21

In stead of Question 5, the following variant is also enough for our purpose
Question 6: Is it true that ♯IsoF ix2n+1(fc)

♯IsoF ix2n(fc) for all n = 1, 2, 3, . . .?

≥

2.3.4. A speculation on the exponential growth of the isolated periodic points. Another curious phe-
nomenon, which we do not need in resolving Conjecture 1.5, is that the sequence [♯IsoF ix2n+2(fc)]1/2n+2)
(for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) seems to be increasing. We do not know of a possible explanation for this

interesting phenomenon.

However, if this increasing phenomenon is true, and the phenomena mentioned in Questions 4

and 5 are also true, then we will obtain

log 2.0890

and it is then reasonable to speculate that indeed

also exists. (In this case, the limit of course must be contained in the interval [log 2.0890, log 2.1071].)

3. Conclusions

In this paper, we presented a simple family of birational maps on smooth aﬃne quadric 3-folds,
coming from a polynomial map on C4, which seem to be cohomologically hyperbolic while having
less periodic points than expected. Moreover, the second dynamical degree of these maps seem to

be an algebraic number, but not an algebraic integer.

This kind of maps requires the development of new tools/ideas stronger than those in the current

literature. For example, the proof of Theorem 2 in [17] - which asserts that for a proper polynomial
map of the complex aﬃne space Cd for which λ2
1 > λ2, we always have that λ1 is an algebraic
number - cannot be used to establish part 2 of Conjecture 1.5 because of two reasons. First, while
F ) > √2),
it seems true that λ3(
b
the map F −1 is not a polynomial map and hence the arguments used in Theorem 6.1 in [17] -
which rely on the valuation theory on the aﬃne space - cannot be used. Second, even if the issue

F −1) (for example, if one can show that λ3(
d

F −1)2 > λ2(
d

F ) = λ1(

mentioned in the previous sentence can be resolved, it can be diﬃcult to actually construct a
F −1) is also one
matrix with rational coeﬃcients whose spectral radius is exactly ζ2 and that λ1(

22

CINZIA BISI, JONATHAN D. HAUENSTEIN, AND TUYEN TRUNG TRUONG

intersections of varieties (not only for projetcive varieties, but also for aﬃne varieties), which help

to establish various log concavity phenomena. It also requires taking into account periodic points

located in proper analytic subvarieties. In dimension 2, only the case of bimeromorphic self-maps

of surfaces has been dealt with in the literature [53][45][24]. In higher dimensions, for holomorphic

maps or more general meromorphic maps of compact K¨ahler manifolds satisfying certain technical

conditions (including a so-called algebraic stability and an assumption on the sequence of currents

of integration associated to the graphs of iterates of the map), there have been work in [23] and [58].
F −1 is conjectured to be not an algebraic
d

Note that since the ﬁrst dynamical degree of our map

integer, there will be no birational model of its which is 1-algebraic stable.

Besides Conjecture 1.3, another consequence of Conjecture 1.1 is the following:

Conjecture 3.1. Let X be a smooth complex projective variety, and f : X 99K X a dominant
rational map. If f is cohomologically hyperbolic, then the set of isolated periodic points of f is

Zariski dense.

Conjecture 3.1 is independent of the birational model of f . Besides the cases where Conjecture

1.1 is known to be valid, one nontrivial case where Conjecture 3.1 is solved in the aﬃrmative is

when X is of dimension 2 and f is a birational map [59]. (In this case, f being cohomologically
hyperbolic is equivalent to λ1(f ) > 1, and the latter fact can be checked by a ﬁnite algorithm
following the paper [22] mentioned above. Indeed, there is a suﬃcient criterion for λ1(f ) > 1 in
terms of some inequalities involving only several ﬁrst terms in the degree sequence for f , see [59].)

In light of the map considered in Conjecture 1.5, it is interesting to check whether Conjecture 3.1

holds for every cohomologically hyperbolic birational maps in dimension 3.

Concerning the equality for the Gromov-Yomdin’s and Dinh-Sibony’s bounds on the topoligical

entropy of a map f in terms of its dynamical degrees, that is htop(f )
max log λj(f ), [19] shows that
a generic birational map of Cd will obtain this bound. On the other hand, the proof therein uses the
assumption that the maps concerned are algebraic stable (which is not satisﬁed for our map). The

≤

construction of the Banach space in [17] makes use of the N´eron-Severi groups of birational models

of the given map, and for topological entropy a similar consideration using topological entropies of

birational models of the given map was proposed in [20]. It is interesting to see can the ideas in

[20] work for our map

etale covers of the map (but then, must work with correspondences in general) proposed in [54] can

fc (or
b

F ). One can also try to check if the more general approach of using
b

work.

Among the experimental tools, one needs faster and less expensive (while still being highly

reliable) methods to deal with numerical calculations for solving systems of equations, in particular

those specially designed for compositions of simple maps.

Indeed, the calculations presented in

Section 2 are more or less at the upper limit of what current calculation methods can aﬀord us

(even for the very simple map F ).

23

Since dynamical degrees can be deﬁned over any algebraically closed ﬁeld [56][16], it is also

meaningful to extend the study mentioned above to arbitrary algebraically closed ﬁelds.
