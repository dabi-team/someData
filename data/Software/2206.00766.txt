Abstract

Dam failures occur worldwide, often from factors including aging structures, ex-
treme hydrologic loading, and design oversights related to the changing climate. Un-
derstanding and mitigating risk to downstream inhabited areas require developing and
improving low-cost high-ﬁdelity tools, such as numerical models, which allow emer-
gency managers to predict the consequences of dam failures better. Two-dimensional
(2D) depth-averaged hydraulic models can provide valuable insights into the impor-
tance of breach parameters or downstream ﬂow characteristics, but historical studies
considering historic failures using real topographies are less common in literature. This
study compares GeoClaw, a 2D hydraulic model with adaptive mesh reﬁnement capa-
bilities, to an industry-standard software HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center -
River Analysis System) using the 1976 Teton Dam failure as a case study. The suitabil-
ity of GeoClaw for dam failure modeling is determined based on its capability to resolve
inundation extent and ﬂood wave arrival times. This study performs sensitivity analy-
ses of the HEC-RAS model to compare an instantaneous dam breach assumption with
a time-dependent breach formation for quantifying the model uncertainty. We ﬁnd
the 2D GeoClaw dam-break model results compare reasonably with historical gauge
records and ﬁeld observational data and HEC-RAS results. The model demonstrates
stability and relatively low computational costs. Our ﬁndings highlight opportunities
for future work, with the GeoClaw software performance supporting continued studies
to evaluate performance. Outcomes of this study will assist dam owners, ﬂoodplain
managers, and emergency managers by providing an additional tool for estimating the
impacts of dam failures to protect lives and infrastructure downstream.

1 Introduction

Dam failures have caused some of the most signiﬁcant disasters associated with
the failure of human-made systems, and the aging dam population is expected to in-
crease by 65% in failures in the next decade (ASDSO, 2021). Although dam failures
are relatively rare, with one large-scale dam failure per year, climate change studies
suggest catastrophic dam failures are likely to become more common due to increased
hydrologic loading, as most of the aging dam population was not designed to consider
global warming; earthen dams being especially vulnerable (Stanford University, 2018;
Loza & Fid´elis, 2021; Boulange et al., 2021). The United States (US) has 91,000 dams
that impound 965,606 km of rivers, with an average of ten reported dam failures oc-
curring every year (ASDSO, 2021). Despite advancements in technology and current
monitoring tools in place, catastrophic dam failures continue to occur. Two recent ex-
amples are the Edenville and Sanford Dam failures in Michigan, United States (ASCE,
2021).

Computational models are crucial tools for assessing the downstream conse-
quences of potential catastrophic dam failures. While a fully three-dimensional (3D)
simulation of a ﬂooding event would be prohibitive for all but the fastest supercom-
puters, two-dimensional (2D), depth-averaged numerical models have been shown to
provide robust results that agree well with observations and can be run eﬃciently on
standard laptops or desktop workstations (N´eelz et al., 2010). Because the downstream
ﬂow conditions are often physically complex however, it is critical to investigate the
importance and sensitivity of key parameters such as roughness coeﬃcient and dam
failure mode in these 2D hydraulic models. Software validation and documentation of
model sensitivity provides the end user conﬁdence in model results (N´eelz et al., 2010;
Psomiadis et al., 2021).

Many studies have generally assumed that an instantaneous dam breach can be
used instead of a more realistic time-dependent dam breach (Wurbs, 1987; Valiani et
al., 2002). However, ongoing research is investigating the validity of this assumption

–2–

due to limited scientiﬁc evidence to substantiate that assumption with earthen dam
breaches (Yi, 2011; Bhandari, 2017). We test the validity of the instantaneous breach
assumption by comparing the downstream consequences between a time-dependent
and an instantaneous dam failure mode for the Teton Dam failure.

This study compares the research code GeoClaw developed initially at the Uni-
versity of Washington (Berger et al., 2011; George, 2011; Turzewski et al., 2019),
to HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center - River Analysis System), developed by
the Army Corps of Engineers (Brunner, 2002; Urzic˘a et al., 2021). A key advantage
of the GeoClaw software is that it can adaptively reﬁne the numerical mesh used to
track ﬂood progression over large topographic domains. HEC-RAS conversely has a
sophisticated Graphical User Interface (GUI) and advanced tools for implementing
diﬀerent modes of dam failure and roughness coeﬃcients, for example. GeoClaw has
been validated for use in tsunami modeling, it has not been widely used for dam failure
modeling, so this study tests the appropriateness of using GeoClaw for academic dam
failure studies, in comparison to the HEC-RAS software, which serves as an industry
standard for dam failure modeling.

Actual dam failure events can oﬀer a robust source of observational data for
use in validating high-performance computational codes. Examples of commonly used
dam failures events used as software benchmark problems include the Malpasset dam
failure, Baldwin Hills reservoir failure, and Vajont dam failure case studies (Aureli
et al., 2021; Begnudelli & Sanders, 2007; Bosa & Petti, 2011; Urzic˘a et al., 2021;
Hervouet & Petitjean, 1999; Biscarini et al., 2016; Valiani et al., 2002; Gallegos et
al., 2009).
In this study, we use the 1976 Teton Dam failure (US), an event that
predominantly formed the basis for the understanding of dam failures (Reclamation,
1976, 2006; ASDSO, 2021). The Teton Dam domain provides complex topography to
challenge 2D solvers and has a wealth of data associated with the event because of its
historical importance. The Teton Dam failure is a demanding and unique case study
for computational code comparison that requires simulating ﬂood wave propagation
over complex terrain.

This study answers two guiding questions through an examination of the hy-
draulics and a thorough comparison of two 2D modeled downstream ﬂow regimes of
the Teton Dam failure:

• How does GeoClaw compare with HEC-RAS using the Teton Dam benchmark
problem? To answer this question this study uses a comparison criteria including
ﬂood wave arrival times, lateral inundation extent, and ﬂow depths.

• How sensitive is the Teton Dam HEC-RAS model and what is the model uncer-
tainty? To answer this question four sensitivity analyses were performed eval-
uating the models sensitivity to (i) computational mesh cell size (ii) Manning’s
roughness coeﬃcient (iii) the time-dependent or instantaneous dam breach as-
sumption (iv) reservoir volume size.

2 Background

2.1 Teton Dam Site and Historic Failure

The Teton Dam geometry and ﬂood were well-documented by the Bureau of
Reclamation (Reclamation), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and local
residents, allowing for a robust account describing the event (Reclamation, 2006, 1976;
Carter, 1976; USGS, 1976).

This event has been studied using one-dimensional models and has helped form
the basis for the understanding of earthen dam failures (Blanton, 1977; Snyder, 1977;
Brown, 1977; Fread, 1977; Thomas, 1977; Macchione & Sirangelo, 1990; Gundlach &

Thomas, 1977; Balloﬀet & Scheﬄer, 1982). This study contributes new analyses for
determining the numerical algorithms’ eﬀectiveness for dam-break modeling (Aureli
et al., 2021). Furthermore, the data from this paper provides documentation of the
consolidated Teton Dam failure data for future work in preparing the Teton Dam
failure as a more common a benchmark problem for code comparison (Spero, Hannah
and Calhoun, Donna and Schubert, Michael, 2021).

The Teton Dam Site consists of the Teton River Canyon (21 km upstream from
Rexburg, Idaho) and the Teton Dam in Eastern Idaho, US. The Teton River canyon is
narrow at the upstream end, 30.5 km from its mainstem near Victor, ID. The canyon
becomes gradually wider downstream with a decreasing slope (Magleby, 1981; Recla-
mation, 2000; Pierce et al., 1992; Williams et al., 1982). Reclamation commissioned
the embankment dam to provide irrigation and ﬂood control along with wildlife mit-
igation measures (Reclamation, 1976). At time of failure, the Teton Dam was one of
the tallest dams in the US in 1976, with a crest height of 93 m at elevation 1626 m
above mean sea level (MSL). The length of the crest of the dam was 914.4 m, and the
width of the crest was 10.7 m. Although the dam was designed to store a volume of
3.55 × 108 m3 (288,000 acre-ft, it only reached 2.89 × 108 m3 (234,260 acre-ft) before
failure (Reclamation, 2006). At the time of failure, the Teton Reservoir had 82 m
Water Surface Elevation (WSE) above the river bed (2006).

At 7:30 on 5 June 1976, a piping failure occurred in the earthen dam when the un-
derlying porous basaltic rock allowed water to seep through the embankment carrying
away the core material under extreme pressures, resulting in a catastrophic breaching
of the dam (Reclamation, 1976). The resulting ﬂood extended 250 km downstream
where the American Falls Reservoir captured the ﬂow (6 June 1976). The ﬂood-
ing destroyed downstream infrastructure and caused 11 deaths (Nagel & Ptak, 2021;
Reclamation, 1976). From Reclamation analyses, the signiﬁcant internal destruction
of the dam occurred over the period of one hour between 11:00 - 11:57 on 5 June 1976
(Solava & Delatte, 2003; Reclamation, 1976).

2.2 A Computational Model of Dam Failure

2.2.1 Shallow Water Equations Application in Dam Break Modeling

It is widely accepted that the shallow water wave equations (SWE) are an ap-
propriate mathematical formulation for resolving dam failure ﬂood regimes, beginning
with critical work in the 1970s (Martin & Zovne, 1971; Strelkoﬀ et al., 1977; Keefer &
Simons, 1977; Shigeeda et al., 2001; Kocaman et al., 2021). General agreement exists
that the SWE can be used to describe dam-break waves over natural topography as
they combine computational eﬃciency and accurate reconstruction of real-world ﬂow
regimes (Balloﬀet & Scheﬄer, 1982; Hervouet & Petitjean, 1999). However, the SWE
do not contain non-hydrostatic terms and therefore cannot explicitly represent extreme
vertical accelerations directly at the dam-break site. Downstream, where a laminar,
hydrostatic ﬂow properties are valid, accurate ﬂow ﬁelds can recovered and can ac-
curately estimate ﬂow regimes (Garcia-Martinez et al., 2009). Additionally, although
speciﬁc 3D models can simulate dam-breaks (including depicting pressures using non-
hydrostatic terms), the computational cost of a 3D model for simulating dam-break
phenomena is substantial. For example, 3D models often require higher resolution
topography, they solve additional terms at each time step, and require technological
advances in high-performance computing or access to computing resources one might
not have for parallel processing (Hu et al., 2018; Capasso et al., 2021).

For dam failure modeling, several computational models implement the SWEs for
simulating downstream ﬂooding dynamics allowing for hazard assessment, mitigation
planning, and academic studies of ﬂow regime (Yakti et al., 2018; Shrestha et al.,
2020; George & Nair, 2015; Kumar et al., 2017). Below, we describe the GeoClaw,
and HEC-RAS models with additional details are summarized in Table 1.

2.2.2 HEC-RAS

First released in 1995 by the US Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) (Brunner,
2002), HEC-RAS v.5.0.7 (2019) has the capability of performing 2D computations
based on depth-averaged ﬂow (Brunner, 2016; USACE, 2019). HEC-RAS uses an
implicit ﬁnite volume method and can take larger time steps than would normally be
required by an explicit method (CivilGEO, 2021). Recent work includes simulation of
a levee breach and resulting inundation, where a combined 1D/2D HEC-RAS approach
was used and illustrated good agreement with observed data, and complex 2D models
(Dasallas et al., 2019). A similar hydrodynamic approach was used, based on the
HEC-RAS v.5.0.7 model to reproduce the Ukai Dam (India) ﬂood event (Patel et
al., 2017). This simulation highlighted the broad capabilities of HEC-RAS 5.0.7 for
ﬂood modeling and inundation mapping studies from dam failure (2017). Additionally,
HEC-RAS has been used as a standard benchmark tool to test the performances of
other models as it is both open-source and easily accessible through a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) (Costabile et al., 2020; Brunner, 2016).

2.2.3 GeoClaw

The GeoClaw software v.5.8 (2020) is part of the open-source software package
Clawpack (Conservation Laws Package). GeoClaw has been used in previous studies
for storm surge, outburst ﬂoods, debris ﬂow, (Mandli & Dawson, 2014; George, 2011;
Turzewski et al., 2019; MacInnes et al., 2013; Arcos & LeVeque, 2015), and has been
extensively tested and validated for tsunami simulations (Gonz´alez et al., 2011). Based
on a high-resolution ﬁnite volume algorithm described in (LeVeque, 2002), GeoClaw is
unique in that it can dynamically adapt mesh resolution to follow solution features of
interest. In dam failure modeling, GeoClaw can be tuned to use high-resolution grids
only in ﬂooding regions where the water column height is larger than zero. Using
this reﬁnement strategy, GeoClaw can eﬃciently solve multi-scale hydrodynamic ﬂow
problems on much larger domains than would typically be feasible for uniformly reﬁned
meshes. GeoClaw has been used for at least one dam failure problem previously and
shown to produce results with good agreement with observational data (George, 2011).
Inputs for GeoClaw are user-deﬁned topography, reservoir parameterization (water
surface elevation, boundary), dam failure speciﬁcations (height, location, timing), and
a roughness parameter. One of the chief contributions of this study is to provide more
evidence that GeoClaw should be considered further for dam failure modeling.

2.3 Previous Work

Researchers have developed a wide range of computational models for dam fail-
ure. Below, we describe computational models of the Teton Dam and Malpasset dam
failures.

2.3.1 Teton Dam Failure

2.3.1.1 Bureau of Reclamation 1977 Reclamation used a preliminary version
of HEC-RAS, called USTFLO (Gradually Varied Unsteady Flow Proﬁles model) to
investigate the Teton Dam failure (Land, 1980). Reclamation used a 1D model with
horizontal water surface traverse to the ﬂow to model the failure (Gundlach & Thomas,
1977). The model was parameterized with an instantaneous ﬂood development se-
quence and full dynamic routing to perform breach analyses (Land, 1980). The 1976
Reclamation data sets (Table 2) can be compared with USTFLO Reclamation 1977
study results at Gundlach and Thomas (1977).

2.3.1.2 Balloﬀet and Scheﬄer 1982 Balloﬀet and Scheﬄer applied a 1D ﬁnite-
diﬀerence (FD) model to simulate the Teton Dam failure ﬂood in an explicit scheme
((1982)). This study used a network of channels and reservoirs, considering the pro-
gression inundation and drying of the ﬂoodplain, to model the ﬂood. Their results
indicate that a 1D-FD model using network analysis allows for a more accurate rep-
resentation of ﬂood propagation than the methods of previous studies, which used
1D models producing averaged stage and discharge across the ﬂoodplain (Gundlach &
Thomas, 1977).

2.3.1.3 Idaho National Laboratory 2015

Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Boise

State University, and Neutrino Dynamics Inc. modeled a hypothetical Teton Dam fail-
ure. The study parameterized the Teton Dam breach with a Teton Reservoir WSE
of 115 m, compared to the historical 82 m WSE (Reclamation, 2000). The scenario
models a hypothetical Teton Dam Failure and the resulting inundation of a ﬁctitious
nuclear power plant. The inundation at INL was modeled using 3D Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) - a robust Lagrangian approach for simulating ﬂuid ﬂows. The
breach was exaggerated to show a dramatic coupling of the ﬂood (Smith et al., 2015).
This coupling eﬀort was modeled in three stages: (1) 2D GeoClaw simulation, (2) 3D
domain of Neutrino Flow, and (3) Inﬂow to the 3D domain. The GeoClaw compu-
tational model used an instantaneous dam failure with a vertical wall of water where
the dam was located at an initial water height of 115 m from ground level (Smith et
al., 2015). The GeoClaw results were one-way coupled to the 2D DualSPHysics SPH
open-source code coupled with the 3D SPH area (Smith et al., 2015). This work served
as a preliminary test case for the GeoClaw software in modeling the Teton Dam failure.

2.3.2 Malpasset Dam failure

2.3.2.1 GeoClaw study The GeoClaw study of Malpasset Dam failure by George
was the ﬁrst to apply GeoClaw to dam failure modeling (George, 2011). The prelim-
inary results for the ﬁrst validation of this code for dam-break ﬂooding problems
demonstrated that GeoClaw is a viable alternative to using specially developed un-
structured meshes exhibiting minimal computational cost with result accuracy because
of AMR’s eﬃciency (George, 2011). This study compared GeoClaw results to results
of the commercial software package TELEMAC-2D (Valiani et al., 2002; Hervouet &
Petitjean, 1999). The comparison concluded that all three numerical simulations had
nearly identical results that diﬀered more from laboratory data than from one another
(George, 2011).

2.3.2.2 HEC-RAS study HEC-RAS v4.1.0 was used to model the Malpasset
dam breach benchmark problem compared to 2D modeling software Flood Modeller
(formally known as ISIS) (Almassri, 2011). In simulating the dam break test, HEC-
RAS produced results similar to the historical numerical values. The study concluded
that HEC-RAS was eﬃcient, fast, and accurate for simulating dam breaches. However,
both Flood Modeller and HEC-RAS models required a sizable amount of data input
to initiate the models and produce reliable results (Almassri, 2011).

3 Methods and Data

3.1 Metadata and Domain

This study parameterizes the dam geometry, reservoir, and domain as inputs
for the numerical simulations. We use a large domain, the Teton Dam study area
(88.5 km x 43.5 km), to evaluate the performance of a uniform Manning’s n (surface
roughness coeﬃcient) and the software’s handling of the complex terrain-the steep-
walled narrow canyon and the ﬂoodplain. This study selected a downstream limit of
the model at 54 km, or just past the town of Roberts, Idaho (US). This study chose

–7–

manuscript submitted to

the downstream limit based on the limitation of high-resolution topographic data.
However, this limitation does not prevent us from a complete study comparing the
GeoClaw and HEC-RAS models. In HEC-RAS we also parameterize the earthen dam
piping failure to appropriately simulate the time-dependent failure sensitivity analysis.

For this benchmark problem parameterization, horizontal and vertical datum
conversions were used to align topographic features with historical values. Two to-
pographies were implemented in this modeling eﬀort, originally sourced from the USGS
in projection WGS 84 (USGS, 2015): ”TetonLarge” (6.99 KB) at 30 m resolution and
”TetonHighRes” (7.77 KB) at 10 m resolution. TetonHighRes and TetonLarge form
a 88.51 x 43.45 km3 domain. The joined topography was used in the GeoClaw and
HEC-RAS models to enable model comparison.

3.2 Reservoir volume

This study estimated the initial reservoir volume using historical design draw-
ings and updated volume estimates to approximate the reservoir extent (Reclamation,
1976; Reclamation, 2000). Three reports by Reclamation provide three diﬀerent esti-
mates of the reservoir volumes at time of failure: 3.08 × 108 m3 - (1976), 2.89 × 108 m3
- (2000), and 3.10 × 108 m3 - (2008). The values seem similar but may be signiﬁcant in
downstream inundation depths; this study tests the model’s sensitivity to the reservoir
volume. Each of these calculations was conducted diﬀerently. Balloﬀett and Scheﬄer
(1982) suggest that the (1976) Reclamation’s initial reservoir volume was calculated
using an elevation-storage curve, implying a horizontal reservoir surface which addi-
tional work determined to not signiﬁcantly aﬀect 1D ﬂood routing (Thomas, 1977;
Fread, 1977; Reclamation, 1976). In comparison, Reclamation improved volume es-
timates in (2000) by using higher resolution contour maps to calculate volume from
contour elevation maps.

These volume estimates were compared with calculations from Google Earth us-
ing the historical parameters for the reservoir to map the quasi-prismatic river channel
in sections. Spero et al. calculated the average height, and obtained an upper bound
estimate of 3.51 × 108 m3 (Spero & Calhoun, 2020). The volume discrepancies show
the necessity for this study to determine the inﬂuence of reservoir volume on down-
stream ﬂow using the 2D HEC-RAS software and sensitivity analysis. The Teton Dam
reservoir elevation was parameterized at an initial elevation of 1617 m.

3.3 GeoClaw Simulation

The ﬁrst step in constructing the GeoClaw simulation involved determining key
input parameters and creating the reservoir. For the GeoClaw model, this study uses
values from Reclamation because of their datum and more accurate volume calcula-
tion method (2000). To parameterize the reservoir, a polygon was deﬁned at Teton
Canyon’s edges, extending 16 km upstream from the dam site. The GeoClaw ‘reser-
voir’ polygon was used to estimate the volume and ﬂow. Points were plotted at the
historic dam height throughout the reservoir – 1624 m MSL. Then, the Teton River was
ﬁlled with water to 1617 m water surface elevation (NAVD 88) (Reclamation, 2000).
The reservoir volume in GeoClaw was 3.05 × 108 m3, considered to be within suitable
range.

GeoClaw was parameterized using an instantaneous dam breach assumption;
the ﬁrst time step of the simulation represents the dam’s immediate removal. We
also enforced reﬁnement by associating minimum ﬂow criteria with maximum mesh
resolution, ensuring the reservoir was reﬁned enough to provide reasonable resolution
to capture the moving ﬂood front. The Manning’s coeﬃcient for the study area was
set to be a constant of 0.06. This value was estimated from a ﬁeld inspection of the

ﬂoodplain and Teton River Canyon. For conﬁrmation of the Manning’s n value, we
used Manning’s n deﬁnitions (Chow, 1959), gauge data, high watermark data, ﬁeld
interviews, newspaper records, high water marks, and hydrograph comparisons, and
veriﬁcation data to determine the conﬁdence of 0.06 value (Gundlach & Thomas, 1977).

Both stationary and Lagrangian gauges were inserted into the GeoClaw simu-
lation, tracking ﬂood wave arrival time and depth downstream. In Table 3.3, gauge
locations are provided. Stationary gauges output the SWE solution at ﬁxed geograph-
ical positions and serve as proxies for comparison with historical records and accounts
and log the ﬂood wave arrival times and peak ﬂow values.

To visualize the ﬂow ﬁeld, we create a series of output images (.png ﬁles), viewed
in the Google Earth browser. The color scale on the images is used to depict inundation
depth.

Tracking the ﬂuid continuum downstream was diﬃcult around localized topo-
graphic highs (ex: Menan Butte 1713 m), so this study used two 3 × 3 grids of La-

the conservation laws for volume and momentum within an Eulerian system, we need
to transform the time derivative of an integral over a moving ﬂuid volume into ﬁeld
coordinates; this leads to or requires the Reynolds Transport Theorem (Price, 2004).

Team, 2021a).

3.4 HEC-RAS Simulation

The ﬁrst step to parameterizing the historic Teton Reservoir in HEC-RAS is to
develop a terrain data set in the HEC-RAS RAS Mapper. The projection was set to
the new raster projection for unit agreement using ArcGIS Pro 10.8.1 (US customary
units were used within the HEC-RAS model). The projection ﬁle was created with
ArcGIS Pro 10.8.1. A new terrain was data set was created by layering TetonHighRes
(10 m) on TetonLarge (30 m). TetonHighRes topography has a ﬁner resolution, so
it was given a higher priority in the combined Terrain Layer. To develop the 2D
computational mesh, a polygon boundary was drawn for the 2D Teton Reservoir area.
The Teton Reservoir (denoted TDRES2D) nominal grid resolution of 61 times 61 m
cells was used to build the HEC-RAS computational mesh.

time-dependent ﬁnal breach polygon is outlined in red. Historical values were implemented to

match historical literature values and ﬁt the terrain using the Breach (plan data) section of the

SA/2D connector. The best ﬁt was identiﬁed as having a Center Station of 284 m, a ﬁnal bottom

width of 55 m, and a ﬁnal bottom elevation of 1549 m (NAVD 88).

Similarly, the 2D downstream ﬂow area was constructed using the RAS Mapper
geometry editor. The 2D downstream ﬂow area was reﬁned with each run to re-
ﬂect the computational area where ﬂow occurred, improving computational eﬃciency.
The ﬁnal 2D downstream ﬂow area for both the instantaneous HEC-RAS and the
time-dependent HEC-RAS models used a uniform Manning’s coeﬃcient of 0.06. The
sensitivity analysis for this study focuses on the importance of Manning’s coeﬃcient.
The base of the downstream ﬂow area (2D-DSTREAM) fed into a boundary condition
line (BC Line) where the water could exit the simulation. Additionally, two break-lines
were inserted into the simulation to force a cell edge at two important lateral features,
diﬀerences in elevation. Through break-lines, we are better able to simulate water ﬂow
over cells. The ﬁrst break-line was within the Teton Dam canyon downstream of the
Teton Dam. Break-line 2 was inserted approximately from (43.98 ,−111.58 ) to (43.90 ,
−111.65 ).

The two 2D Flow Area elements (TD-RES-2D and TD-DSTREAM) are con-
nected with a storage area 2D connector (SA/2D), which formed the dam as a weir
or embankment. The dam was parameterized in the geometry editor for the instanta-
neous dam failure by modeling the weir to ﬁt the terrain. The time-dependent dam
failure was also parameterized in the geometry editor. The dam structure was built
using the historic dam height of 1626 m (NAVD 88) (Reclamation, 1976).

For additional time-dependent dam failure parameterization, the piping coef-
ﬁcient was 0.5 based on (Reclamation, 1976), and the initial piping elevation from
historical literature (ﬁrst spot of seepage) was 1597 m (Reclamation, 1976). The start
date and time of the failure to achieve a maximum breach at 11:57 were and a simula-
tion start time of 11:00; start time was chosen based on time stamps on photographs
from 1976 failure. A sine wave breach progression was used as the breach progres-
sion method, validated in other literature studies (Bhandari, 2017). The progression
method depicts how the breach grows from initiation to maximum size during the
breach period (bp), where for this study, the bp is 11:00-12:00, one hour. The sine
wave progression speed varies over the development time according to the ﬁrst quarter
cycle of a sine wave. It was chosen as it most closely resembles an earthen dam breach
(Ackerman et al., 2008; Yochum et al., 2008).

For the instantaneous dam failure plan, the simulation time starts at the time
of breach, 11:57 on 5 June 1976 (Reclamation, 1976) and runs for simulated time
12 hours and 43 minutes (24:00 6 June 1976). The computational interval and time
stepping scheme depends on the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition (CFL). Besides
the geometry ﬁles, the primary diﬀerence in the two analysis runs was the simulation
start times. The time-dependent dam failure required the sine wave initiation and the
breach lasted 1 hour, the simulation begins before the dam breach (11:00) and runs
until 24:00 6 June, 1976. Additionally, the ﬁrst HEC-RAS model was constructed using
the Diﬀusion Wave equations. Then, once the model was stable, this study changed
the model to solve using the Full Momentum SWE equations.

4 Results of GeoClaw and HEC-RAS Models

Results are presented in three sections. Section 4.1 focuses on stationary gauge re-
sults beginning upstream at the Teton Dam site and moving downstream until Rexburg
(25 km downstream; Table 3.3). Section 4.2 focuses on the lateral extent of ﬂooding.
Section 4.1.7 focuses on Lagrangian gauge components in GeoClaw and results.

4.1 GeoClaw and HEC-RAS Instantaneous Dam Failure Results

We compare all historic inundation depths (maximum) against numerical simu-
lations performed using our GeoClaw numerical dam model. The results focus on ﬁve
of the GeoClaw and HEC-RAS stationary gauges, which logged historic arrival times
(hrs) and maximum ﬂow depth (m) of the ﬂood during the model’s simulation time.
The gauge results are presented below in sequential order moving from the dam pro-
gressively downstream: (i) Teton Dam Canyon gauge, (ii) Teton Dam Canyon Mouth
gauge, (iii) Wilford gauge, (iv) Sugar City gauge, and the (v) Rexburg gauge. The
sensitivity analysis use results from three proﬁle lines that logged ﬂow and ﬂood wave
arrival times: (a) Sugar City, (b) Rexburg, and (c) Menan Butte Butte Table 4.2.

4.1.1 Teton Dam Canyon Gauge

The GeoClaw Teton Dam Canyon gauge showed a 7.6 m maximum depth ﬂood
wave, averaging to 7.3 m, propagating down the canyon. Because GeoClaw models an
instantaneous dam breach, the inundation ﬂood wave arrival time for the GeoClaw
Teton Dam Canyon gauge occurs during the second time step – almost immediately at
12:05. In comparison, photographs at the time of failure at the location of the GeoClaw
Teton Dam Canyon gauge demonstrate a maximum ﬂood wave depth of about 15 m
and arrival times at 12:05 (Reclamation, 1976). The HEC-RAS Teton Dam Canyon
Gauge shows 41.3 m maximum depth ﬂood wave, within the Teton Canyon. The
ﬂood wave arrives at the HEC-RAS gauge at 11:59, just two minutes following the
instantaneous dam breach at 11:57 (Reclamation, 1976).

4.1.2 Teton Dam Canyon Mouth Gauge

The GeoClaw Teton Dam Canyon Mouth gauge records ﬂood wave arrival time
ﬁve minutes later at 12:10. The GeoClaw gauge registers a maximum ﬂood wave depth
of 2.1 m inundation, which is considerably less than the historical values of 11.8 m-
12.2 m (Reclamation, 1976). Then, as the ﬂood laterally spread out of the canyon, it
does not ﬂood the town of Teton, agreeing with the lateral extent of the historic ﬂood.
However, the historic depths are greater than those modeled in GeoClaw by 9.2 m.
For the HEC-RAS Teton Dam Canyon Mouth Gauge, the maximum recorded depth
was 20.6 m, 8.5 m greater than historical values (Reclamation, 1976). The HEC-RAS
gauge logged a ﬂood wave arrival time of 12:06.

4.1.3 Wilford Gauge

At 12:38, the GeoClaw Wilford gauge displays a depth of 2.7 m. Historical litera-
ture values show ﬂood waves reaching Wilford at approximately 12:45 with 3.1 −4.6 m
inundation depth (Reclamation, 1976). The HEC-RAS model Wilford gauge displays
maximum inundation depth of 7.2 m overestimating the 3.1 −4.6 m in historical data
by about 2.6 meter. Additionally, HEC-RAS had an arrival time at 12:34.

4.1.4 Sugar City Gauge

The GeoClaw Sugar City gauge showed a ﬂood wave arrival time at 13:05.
The historical literature value for arrival time was 13:30, and ﬂood depth was 3.1 m
(Reclamation, 1976). The depth, as displayed in the GeoClaw gauge, is 1.2 m. The
HEC-RAS Sugar City gauge registered a ﬂood wave arrival time at 14:05 (Reclamation,
1976) and a maximum depth of 3.4 m.

4.1.5 Rexburg Gauge

The GeoClaw Rexburg gauge demonstrated model values between 1.2 −1.5 m;
historical depths were 2.4 m(Reclamation, 1976). The Rexburg GeoClaw gauge logs
an arrival time at 14:30, and the historic arrival time is 14:30 (Reclamation, 1976).
The HEC-RAS Rexburg gauge shows an arrival time of 16:25, an hour and 55 minute
diﬀerence from historical values. The gauge also logs a maximum depth of 34 m.

4.1.6 Lateral Extent of Modeled Floods and Computational Costs

The other evaluation principle for the comparison criterion for GeoClaw was
determining the lateral ﬂood extent. The GeoClaw model showcased a ﬂood area
covered 313 km2 which is within ± 80 km2 of the historic inundation extent of 337 km2
for the time simulated (Reclamation, 1976).
In comparison, the HEC-RAS model
demonstrated a ﬂood area of 451 km2, which is also within 80 km2 of the historical
337 km2 (Reclamation, 1976).

GeoClaw computational time for runs on the R2 compute cluster installed at
Boise State University, is 17 minutes processing time and 15 minutes for plotting.
For HEC-RAS the base model run time was 31 minutes, which includes both run
and plot time. Therefore, GeoClaw and HEC-RAS have similar computational wall
clock times, 32 minutes compared with 31 minutes. The GeoClaw model ran on 24
OpenMP threads on a single Intel Xeon Gold 6252 processor (2.10 GHz) of the R2
super compute cluster (Boise State Research Computing, 2017). The computational
budget of the HEC-RAS Teton Dam base model included 28 cores on a single Intel
Xeon E5-2680 v4 14 core (2.4GHz) node. HEC-RAS simulations were run on an Intel
Xeon E5-2680 v4 14 core 2.4GHz (x2).

4.1.7 Lagrangian Gauges Results

This study introduced Lagrangian particles into our depth-averaged ﬂow ﬁeld
in the GeoClaw runs to better image the downstream ﬂows for indicating turbulence.
Results, shown in Figure 3 indicate swirling ﬂow dynamics were observed in the dam
failure simulation behind the local topographic high of the domain, Menan Butte (ele-
vation 1713 MSL). As the Lagrangian gauges updated at each time step, both clusters
demonstrated interesting ﬂow paths within the downstream ﬂood. For example, ed-
dying occurred upstream of Menan Butte and detained six of nine Lagrangian gauges
for over 15 minutes. Menan Butte is a large topographic feature, and thus results
showed the ﬂow was substantially aﬀected below the Henry’s Fork river, where the
Snake River begins in Eastern Idaho. At Henry’s Fork, this study noted increased ve-

domain.

4.2 HEC-RAS Sensitivity Analysis

This study used four sensitivity analyses to evaluate which parameters in the
HEC-RAS model control the numerical solutions (Table 3). For the HEC-RAS model
results, we analyzed the output ﬂow hydrograph head and tailwaters, the computation
log for error percentage, the gauge features for water surface elevation, and three
proﬁle lines for ﬂow. The three proﬁle lines, Sugar City, Rexburg, and Menan Butte
were chosen based on relative distance downstream and the plethora of historical data.
Table 4.2 summarizes the four sensitivity analyses:

1. Manning’s roughness coeﬃcient
2. Volume Analysis
3. Instantaneous and Time-Dependent Dam Failure
4. Characteristic Size of the Computational Mesh

Critical trends in the results demonstrate that the reservoir volume controls the
peak ﬂow but not the peak ﬂow arrival time. In contrast, the computational mesh
controlled peak ﬂow arrival time but had similar peak ﬂows. The Manning’s n value
was likely overestimated in this study at 0.06, exhibited in the Manning’s sensitivity
study. Lastly, the instantaneous dam breach assumption was validated as the base
model values were identical in peak ﬂow arrival time and comparable in peak ﬂow.

4.2.1 Manning’s Roughness Coeﬃcient Sensitivity Analysis

The Manning’s n analysis compared roughness values of 0.03-0.07 to determine if
the Manning’s n value controlled the numerical solution. The base model used a value
of 0.06, and all Manning’s n values had a slightly diﬀerent mesh than other models
with an expanded domain laterally to allow for natural ﬂow instead of mesh-directed
ﬂow. At the Sugar City proﬁle line, the 0.03 Manning’s model peak ﬂow arrived ﬁrst
at 13:18, followed sequentially by progressively smaller Manning’s (0.04, 0.05, 0.06,
and 0.07). The peak ﬂow was largest at the Manning’s 0.03 model (35,300 m3/s) and
smallest for the Manning’s 0.07 model (22,000 m3/s). At the Rexburg proﬁle line,
these trends continued as the Manning’s 0.03 model peak ﬂow arrived ﬁrst (14:41),
and the Manning’s 0.07 model peak ﬂow arrived last (16:25) – a diﬀerence of 1 hour
and 45 minutes. Historically, the wave arrived in Rexburg at 14:40 (Reclamation,
1976). The peak ﬂow at the Rexburg proﬁle line was largest for the Manning’s 0.03
model (21,800 m3/s) and lowest for the Manning’s 0.07 model (12,500 m3/s). The
0.06 Manning’s n model (this study’s base model) arrived at 16:25 with a ﬂow of
14.000 m3/s. Further downstream, at the Menan Butte proﬁle line, the Manning’s
0.03 model peak ﬂow arrives 16:07, and the Manning’s 0.07 model peak ﬂow arrives
19:01. The Manning’s 0.03 model peak ﬂow was observed as 7900 m3/s, whereas the
Manning’s 0.07 was recorded as 4000 m3/s. The base model, Manning’s 0.06, recorded
4600 m3/s at 19:01. The peak ﬂow between the largest (0.07) and the smallest (0.03)
Manning’s n models diﬀer by about 23%. Results are shown in Figure 4.

4.2.2 Volume Sensitivity Analysis

The volume sensitivity analysis compared two intial reservoir volumes. Volume 1
is 2.29 × 108 m3 (235,978 acre-ft) representing the historical Reclamation volume value
(Reclamation, 2000). Volume 2 created using the initial reservoir depth of 617 m water

surface elevation (WSE; NAVD 88) or 2.63 × 108 m3 (213,294 acre-ft model (HEC-RAS
Base Model). For the ﬁrst proﬁle line, Sugar City, the base model (617 m3/s) arrived
at 14:05, similar to the historic volume model (13:58). The peak ﬂow at Sugar City
between the two models diﬀers by 3200 m3/s; historic volume model ﬂow of 27,600 m3/s
and base model ﬂow of 24,400 m3/s. At the Rexburg proﬁle line, the base model arrived
at 16:25, and the historic volume model arrived at 16:13. The peak ﬂow rates diﬀered
by 2400 m3/s, with the historic volume model logging the higher ﬂow at 16,400 m3/s.
Then, at the third proﬁle line, Menan Butte, the volume analysis demonstrated the
historic volume model to arrive ﬁrst at 18:38, and then the base model arrived at
19:01, a diﬀerence of fewer than 25 minutes. The peak ﬂow rate for the models were
comparable, with 4600 m3/s (base model) and 5300 m3/s (historic model), which diﬀer
by about 674 m3/s.

The peak ﬂow diﬀers between the historic volume model (Volume 1) and Volume
2 by 6% at the Sugar City proﬁle line, 8% at the Rexburg proﬁle line, and 7% at the
Menan Butte proﬁle line. The ﬂood wave arrival times diﬀer by about 0.4% at the
Sugar City proﬁle line, 0.6% at the Rexburg proﬁle line, and 1% at the Menan Butte
proﬁle line.

4.2.3 Characteristic Size of Computational Mesh Analysis

The results of the computational mesh analysis compare the base model mesh
(242,210 cells; 274 x 274 m - base model mesh) to a mesh with cell sizes increased by
50% (11,157 cells; 411 x 411 m - lower resolution mesh [LRM]) and a mesh with cell
sizes decreased by 50% (980.030 cells; 137 x137 m-higher resolution mesh [HRM]). The
computational cost for the HRM was 4:20:15 hours (15,615 seconds), in comparison to
the LRM, which processed in 14:03 minutes (843 seconds). The base model computes
at 31:13 minutes (1873 seconds). The HRM runs 52% slower than the base model cost,
a signiﬁcant increase in cost.

For the proﬁle line results, the LRM and HRM produced similar results. At
the Sugar City proﬁle line the LRM registered 22,858 m3/s compared to the HRM
22,800 m3/s; a diﬀerence of 0.1% with both ﬂows lower than the base model ﬂow of
24,400 m3/s, but only by 3%. At the Sugar City Proﬁle line then, the base model
arrives ﬁrst at 14:05, followed by the LRM and HRM arriving both at 14:14. Both
the HRM and LRM log a ﬂow of 11,100 m3/s, whereas the base model’s ﬂow was 11%
higher at 14,000 m3/s. The arrival time of the HRM and LRM were both 17:04, and
the base model was 16:25. Further downstream at the Menan Butte proﬁle line, the

–16–

LRM and HRM arrive again simultaneously (20:20) after the base model (19:01). The
LRM and HRM ﬂows were within 1 m3/s being 4000 m3/s respectively); 6% below the
base model ﬂow estimate of 4600 m3/s.

4.2.4 Instantaneous and Time-Dependent Dam Breach Model Results

For instantaneous breach model versus time-dependent breach model sensitivity
analysis, this study assesses the time-dependent scenario and the instantaneous dam
breach scenarios in HEC-RAS. Processed ﬂood wave arrival times accounted for the
time-dependent breach start time of 10:00 diﬀering by 1:57 hours from the instanta-
neous breach. At Sugar City proﬁle line, the instantaneous dam breach logs a ﬂow
of 24,400 m3/s compared to the time-dependent dam breach value of 243,400 m3/s a
diﬀerence of 0.2%; both arrive at 14:05. At the Rexburg proﬁle line, both models
arrive at 16:25 and log extremely similar values (time-dependent model: 14,000 m3/s,
instantaneous model: 14,000 m3/s). Then, at the Menan Butte proﬁle line, both mod-
els arrive at 19:01 and log similar ﬂow values. The time-dependent breach logged and
the instantaneous breach both logged 4600 m/s logged 4600 m3/s. Furthermore, both
computational costs were similar varying only by 30 ±2 minutes.

5 Discussion

Dams in the US are aging, and the frequency of dam failures increases with age.
Floods are one of the most frequent and costly natural disasters the US faces – including
dam failures ﬂooding (ASDSO, 2021). Dam failures pose a signiﬁcant threat to hu-
man life downstream of the dam. One must ﬁrst validate and benchmark the software
using a historical dam failure assessment to forecast dam failures. One of the guiding
questions of the study focused on evaluating GeoClaw for dam failure downstream
modeling. The evaluation was based on mathematical formulation controlling ﬂood
movement, the capability to predict inundation extent and ﬁnal ﬂow depth through a
numerical method, and the ease of use, performance characteristics, and tools for vi-
sualization and post-processing. The second guiding question investigated the model’s
sensitivity to its parameterization and uncertainty.

The stationary gauges used in the two models, HEC-RAS and GeoClaw, allow
comparison of ﬂood wave depth and ﬂood wave arrival time. This section discusses
the ﬁrst two gauges: Teton Dam Canyon gauge, Teton Dam Canyon Mouth gauge,
and the Wilford gauge. The ﬁrst gauge, Teton Dam Canyon, showed a ﬂood wave
arrival time at 12:05 as 7.6 m depth. We consider the GeoClaw Teton Dam Canyon
gauge to agree with historical records when evaluating the ﬂood wave arrival time
(12:05 historical arrival time) (Reclamation, 1976), but not when evaluating by depth
as it underestimates the depth by 7.62 m. The HEC-RAS model overestimates the
ﬂow depth by 5.18 m but agrees with the historical ﬂood arrival time. The GeoClaw
Teton Dam Canyon Mouth gauge underestimates the ﬂood depth by 9 m.

In contrast, the HEC-RAS model’s Teton Dam Canyon Mouth gauge overesti-
mates the depth by about 27 m, and the ﬂood wave arrival time diﬀers from historical
records by over 30 minutes. These diﬀerences are signiﬁcant, and the slow arrival time
and overestimation of the depth suggest that Manning’s n value of 0.06 is too high
in the canyon. However, it is important to note that the Teton Canyon presents the
most challenging portion of the ﬂow to model using the SWE. As within the canyon,
the extreme vertical accelerations are not well captured by the SWE model.

Continuing the discussion of gauge results with the Wilford, Sugar City, and
Rexburg gauges, this study ﬁnds GeoClaw and HEC-RAS values similar to historical
values. At the Wilford gauge, the GeoClaw model estimated the depth within 1.2 m of
historical values and the ﬂood arrival time within 15 minutes – which we consider to

–17–

manuscript submitted to

be excellent agreement. The HEC-RAS model overestimates the ﬂood depth by 4.6 m
and demonstrates a ﬂood arrival time diﬀerence of 40 minutes which is signiﬁcant
(12:38 historical versus 13:17 model). The GeoClaw Sugar City gauge logged general
agreement to the historical literature value arrival time (within 25 minutes) but under-
estimated the depth by 1.8 m. In contrast, the HEC-RAS gauge estimated the ﬂood
within 0.6 m of the historical value, and the ﬂood arrival time is within 10 minutes – we
consider the HEC-RAS Sugar City gauge to be in excellent agreement with historical
data. Further downstream, the GeoClaw Rexburg gauge also demonstrates inundation
agreements with model values within 0.9 m of historical values and the same model
arrival time as historical arrival time (14:30). The HEC-RAS Rexburg gauge slightly
overestimated historical data; the arrival time diﬀers by over 30 minutes.

Major trends in the results show that the GeoClaw model demonstrates good
agreement with historical values for inundation extent, although consistently under-
estimating depth values. The base model results for HEC-RAS showed agreement
with both GeoClaw and with historical data, although consistently overestimating the
maximum ﬂow depth and arrival times. For lateral extent evaluation, the GeoClaw
model was 313 km2 which is within ± 77.7 km2 of the historic inundation extent of
336.7 km2. However, the HEC-RAS model overestimated the extent which could be
related to overestimating the WSE in the reservoir; 450 km2 HEC-RAS base model
compared to the 337 km2 in historical archives, (Reclamation, 1976).

In the assessment of the computational cost, both models are comparable with
wall clock times between 15-17 minutes. HEC-RAS post-processing requires no ad-
ditional plotting, whereas GeoClaw requires about 15 minutes of extra processing to
produce visualization output. Overall, the results allowed this study to answer the
three guiding questions and come across ideas for future work.

5.0.1 Suitability of GeoClaw

This study investigated if the GeoClaw model was suitable for dam failure down-
stream modeling of the Teton Dam failure (objectives outlined in Section 1). We
determined the suitability of the GeoClaw software based on its capability to resolve
lateral inundation extent, ﬂood front arrival times, and maximum ﬂood depths. For
GeoClaw and HEC-RAS, the calculated area for the lateral extent of the ﬂood largely
agrees with historical data. We evaluate the ﬁve inundated simulation domains and
the modeled time of the six stationary gauges inserted into the GeoClaw simulation
for gauge data interpretation. We consider the model in excellent agreement if it pre-
dicts the ﬂood wave arrival time within 15 minutes of historical data. We consider
the model in good agreement if it predicts the wave within 30 minutes of historical
data. Three of the ﬁve GeoClaw gauges log ﬂood wave arrival times within ± 7 min-
utes (Teton Canyon, Teton Canyon Mouth, Wilford -excellent agreement), and all
ﬁve gauges demonstrate good agreement with historical arrival times. By contrast,
the HEC-RAS base model shows three gauges in excellent agreement, one gauge in
good agreement, and the Rexburg gauge predicting an arrival time two hours after the
historic wave arrived (14:30 compared to 16:25).

For assessing maximum ﬂood depths, this study considered a model in excellent
agreement if the depth values were within 1.5 m of historical values. The GeoClaw
model is in good agreement if values are within 3 m of historical values. These val-
ues also take into account uncertainties in the model, such as ambiguity as to loca-
tions where historical values were collected (Reclamation, 1976). For GeoClaw, two
gauges (Wilford and Rexburg) demonstrate excellent agreement with historical data,
and Sugar City demonstrates good agreement with historical values. For HEC-RAS,
only Sugar City demonstrated excellent agreement, and Rexburg demonstrated good
agreement. The Wilford gauge was overpredicted by HEC-RAS (7.2 m compared to

–18–

manuscript submitted to

the historic 4 m). The trends of GeoClaw show it consistently underestimates the
maximum ﬂood depths in the conﬁned canyon area (by 7.6 − 9.1 m). However, as
the modeled GeoClaw ﬂood wave moves downstream out of the canyon, it largely
agrees more with maximum ﬂow depths, illustrating perhaps a resolution limitation of
GeoClaw in the steep canyon terrain. Potentially, for both HEC-RAS and GeoClaw,
using a diﬀerent roughness coeﬃcient in the canyon could lead to improved and more
realistic maximum ﬂow depths.

Other factors considered in model results encompass ﬂood volume, mesh reﬁne-
ment, code eﬃciency, and pre-processing and post-processing workﬂows. The pre-
processing workﬂow for GeoClaw involved retrieving metadata in ASCII format and
transferring that to the Boise State Compute Cluster R2 (Boise State Research Com-
puting, 2017). In contrast, HEC-RAS topography processing required changing ASCII
data to raster using ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro. When considering mesh reﬁnement,
GeoClaw ’s AMR is advantageous, only resolving where the ﬂood propagates and
not requiring an iterative approach to reﬁning the user-deﬁned mesh to improve the
downstream mesh. For code and run time eﬃciency, HEC-RAS and GeoClaw have
similar run times. With semi-parallel processing, GeoClaw could improve run times
to similar processing and plotting speeds. For example, future work could use the
ForestClaw package which could run GeoClaw using distributed computing (Calhoun
& Burstedde, 2017). For the HEC-RAS post-processing workﬂow, as the model runs,
the RAS Mapper window simultaneously updates and stores all results allowing for
visualization over the terrain or online map imagery.

5.0.2 What is the importance of breach progression in dam failure mod-

eling?

The importance of a dam breach was assessed by comparing the HEC-RAS time-
dependent breach model to the instantaneous breach model. Both models yielded
extremely similar results, and the same ﬂood wave arrival times at all three proﬁle
lines. The sensitivity analysis required almost identical ﬂows. Therefore, with the
similar outputs between the two models, we consider using an instantaneous dam
breach estimate rather than parameterizing the historical time-dependent dam breach
to be valid.

5.0.3 What is the uncertainty associated with using HEC-RAS for dam

failure modeling?

Another objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the HEC-RAS
model. The results from the sensitivity analyses indicate the volume and the Man-
ning’s roughness coeﬃcient were shown to largely control the solution and introduce
uncertainty into the model.

For the volume sensitivity analyses, this study compared the historic volume of
2.29 × 108 m3 (Reclamation, 2000) to the base model volume of 2.63 × 108 m3. The
results indicated that the peak ﬂow values between the historic and base models were
progressively aligned as the ﬂood wave moved downstream and laterally expanded.
From Sugar City (ﬂow diﬀerence of 3200 m3/s to Menan Butte (diﬀerence of only
2400 m3/s). However, the peak ﬂow rates did show a range, so knowing an accurate
reservoir volume is critical to building a reliable dam failure model.

In this study, the Manning’s n value also controlled the solution. For instance,
the Sugar City proﬁle line logs the 0.04 n ﬂow arriving at 13:34, which is closer to the
historical value of 13:30 than the 0.06 n base mode which arrived at 14:05 (diﬀerence of
35 minutes). Further downstream, the Rexburg proﬁle line logs the 0.03 n ﬂow arriving
at 14:41, close to the historical value of 14:30. However, the base model (0.06 n) arrives

–19–

manuscript submitted to

at 16:25, nearly 2 hours later – a signiﬁcant diﬀerence. We recommend that future
work involves a depth-variable Manning’s roughness coeﬃcient or a variable Manning’s
roughness coeﬃcient throughout the domain, given that the Manning’s sensitivity
analysis showed that the roughness wholly aﬀects the simulation and computational
results.

Although previous studies demonstrated that the mesh could control a dam fail-
ure ﬂood solution, we conclude from the mesh sensitivity analysis that the mesh does
not control or impact the solution of the Teton Dam ﬂood wave arrival time or ﬂow.
With the low relief of the terrain (with Menan Butte and the Teton canyon as the only
exceptions), and the fairly high resolution cell-gridding, the mesh does not change the
computational result. However, the geometry is a crucial source of potential error in
any hydraulic model with uncertainty. For example, having a higher resolution topog-
raphy 5 m) rather than 10 m for the dam’s reservoir could improve reservoir volume
predictions to be closer to historical values.

Additionally, there is an uncertainty associated with the historical depth value,
as they were not directly associated with a location (longitude and latitude) when
collected in 1976. Therefore, with that data limitation, there is uncertainty associated
with the historical values Table 2. Future work could include a survey in Eastern Idaho
of remaining structures to document known high watermarks to improve this data
limitation. Then, this uncertainty could be eliminated by integrating those locations
as stationary gauges.

The HEC-RAS hydrologic model a widely used dam failure modeling software in
the US. HEC-RAS in the past has been used to model the Teton Dam failure using the
1D unsteady ﬂow routing (1D SWE equations) to route an inﬂowing ﬂood hydrograph
through a reservoir (Land, 1980). In this project, we expand on previous research,
employing HEC-RAS v.5.0.7 2D unsteady ﬂow routing capabilities (Full Momentum
SWE) for comparison to GeoClaw. This study found both HEC-RAS and GeoClaw to
produce similar numerical solutions and resultant simulations with numerical gauges
depicting maximum ﬂow depths and ﬂood wave arrival times that largely agreed with
historical data. With this study and the results, we would recommend using GeoClaw
for forecasting or hindcasting downstream ﬂow behavior from dam breach simulations.

5.1 Recommendations for Future Work

5.1.1 Drone Photogrammetry Generated Topographies in Dam Failure

Modeling

As some dams are in remote locations where only coarse DEMs exist, drone
photogrammetry could be a valuable tool for creating supplemental high-resolution
DEMs. We recommend that future work investigate high-resolution topography usage
in GeoClaw dam breach modeling, focusing on resolution and eﬃciency. Initial testing
demonstrated that drone photogrammetry-generated topography could be uploaded
into the HEC-RAS ’s RAS Mapper as a terrain in GeoTiﬀ format. Through uploading
the three raster data sets in this study, HEC-RAS can further import them within a
single layer, which can be merged into a single raster. Using HEC-RAS or any ESRI
product (ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro), exported combined terrains could be loaded into
GeoClaw for a resolution and run-time eﬃciency-focused study.

5.1.2 Teton Dam GeoClaw Model Manning’s Coeﬃcient

This study recommends additional Manning’s sensitivity analyses to be per-
formed, comparing uniform Manning’s n values which spatially varying Manning’s
roughness sensitivity analyses and depth-averaged Manning’s n. Additionally, to im-
prove uncertainties in this model, we recommend quantifying the geomorphological

–20–

diﬀerences in the canyon from 1976 pre-failure to the present day data as the volume
of landslide debris that might be oﬀsetting reservoir ﬁll volume values in this study.
Future work could involve simulation of a higher-resolution Teton Canyon (generated
from drone photogrammetry as well) which might increase computation times, but
could improve downstream canyon values.

5.1.3 Depth-Averaged Debris Modeling of Teton Dam failure

The current GeoClaw model uses the SWEs and Lagrangian particles to track
streamlines. The massless Lagrangian particles could be further parameterized with
mass, size, drag (function of particle Reynolds number), and buoyancy – the most
signiﬁcant forces acting on ﬂuid objects. Through further parameterization, the user
could model debris carried in the dam failure ﬂood wave such as cattle, houses, sed-
iment (sand), and timber. GeoClaw could use model development like COULWAVE
and ComMIT/MOST(NOAA) to simulate buoyant debris. However, research explores
the simulation of debris sourced from vegetation, vehicles, or non-buoyant debris (the
additional parameterized Lagrangian gauges) such as buildings, sand, and rock. The
Teton Dam failure provides an opportunity for future work in this area, which could
help forecast dam failure risk and can assess costs as debris removal, improving com-
munity resilience.

Open Research

The study used open-source software HEC-RAS (USACE, 2019) and GeoClaw
(Clawpack Development Team, 2021b) for 2D numerical modeling. The Teton Dam
