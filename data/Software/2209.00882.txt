Abstract

The long-standing model-independent annual modulation effect measured by DAMA deep
underground at Gran Sasso Laboratory with different experimental conﬁgurations is sum-
marized and perspectives will be highlighted. DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 set-up, ≃ 250 kg highly
radio-pure NaI(Tl) conﬁrms the evidence of a signal that meets all the requirements of the
model independent Dark Matter annual modulation signature at high C.L.; the full expo-
sure is 2.86 ton × yr over 22 annual cycles. The experiment is currently collecting data
in the DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 empowered conﬁguration with an even lower software energy
threshold. Other recent claims are shortly commented.

1 Introduction

The DAMA/LIBRA [1–20]experiment, as the pioneer DAMA/NaI [21, 22], has the main aim to
investigate the presence of Dark Matter (DM) particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the DM
annual modulation signature (originally suggested in Ref. [23, 24]). In addition, the developed
highly radio-pure NaI(Tl) target-detectors [1,6,9,25]ensure sensitivity to a wide range of DM can-
didates, interaction types and astrophysical scenarios (see e.g. Ref. [19], and references therein).
The origin of the DM annual modulation signature and of its peculiar features is due to the Earth’s
revolution around the Sun, which is moving in the Galaxy; thus, the Earth should be crossed by
a larger ﬂux of DM particles around ≃ 2 June (when the projection of the Earth orbital velocity
on the Sun velocity is maximum) and by a smaller one around ≃ 2 December (when the two
velocities are opposite). The DM annual modulation signature is very distinctive since the effect
induced by DM particles must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements: the rate must
contain a component modulated according to a cosine function (1) with one year period (2) and a
phase that peaks roughly ≃ 2 June (3); this modulation must only be found in a well-deﬁned low
energy range, where DM particle induced events can be present (4); it must apply only to those

2 THEDAMA/LIBRA–PHASE2RESULTS

events in which just one detector of many actually “ﬁres” (single-hit events), since the DM particle
multi-interaction probability is negligible (5); the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal
sensitivity must be <∼ 7% of the constant part of the signal for usually adopted halo distributions
(6), but it can be larger in case of some proposed scenarios such as e.g. those reported in Ref. [19]
(even up to ≃ 30%). Thus this signature has many peculiarities and, in addition, it allows to test
a wide range of parameters in many possible astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics scenarios.
This DM signature might be mimicked only by systematic effects or side reactions able to account
for the whole observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements
given above.

The full description of the DAMA/LIBRA set-up and the adopted procedures during the phase1
and phase2 and other related arguments have been discussed in details e.g. in Refs. [1–6,15–20].
At the end of 2010 all the photomultipliers (PMTs) were replaced by a second generation PMTs
Hamamatsu R6233MOD, with higher quantum efﬁciency (Q.E.) and with lower background with
respect to those used in phase1; they were produced after a dedicated R&D in the company, and
tests and selections were described in Refs. [6, 25]. The new PMTs have Q.E. in the range 33-39%
at 420 nm, wavelength of NaI(Tl) emission, and in the range 36-44% at peak. The commission-
ing of the DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 experiment was successfully performed in 2011, allowing the
achievement of the software energy threshold at 1 keV, and the improvement of some detector’s
features such as energy resolution and acceptance efﬁciency near software energy threshold [6].
The light response of the detectors during phase2 typically ranges from 6 to 10 photoelectrons/keV,
depending on the detector. Energy calibration with X-rays/γ sources are regularly carried out in
the same running condition down to few keV (for details see e.g. Ref. [1]; in particular, double
coincidences due to internal X-rays from 40K (which is at ppt levels in the crystals) provide (when
summing the data over long periods) a calibration point at 3.2 keV close to the software energy
threshold. The DAQ system records both single-hit events (where just one of the detectors ﬁres)
and multiple-hit events (where more than one detector ﬁres) up to the MeV region despite the
optimization is performed for the lowest energy.

2 The DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 results

The details of the annual cycles of DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 are reported in Ref. [19,20]. The ﬁrst an-
nual cycle was dedicated to the commissioning and to the optimizations towards the achievement
of the 1 keV software energy threshold [6]. Thus, the considered annual cycles of DAMA/LIBRA–
phase2 released so far are eight (exposure of 1.53 ton×yr); when considering also the former
DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA–phase1, the exposure is 2.86 ton×yr. The duty cycle of the DAMA/LIBRA–
phase2 experiment is high, ranging between 76% and 86%. The routine calibrations and, in par-
ticular, the data collection for the acceptance windows efﬁciency mainly affect it.

Residual rates versus time for 1 keV energy threshold are reported in Ref. [20]. The former
DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and the new DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 residual rates of the single-hit scintilla-
tion events are reported in Fig. 1. The energy interval is from 2 keV, the software energy threshold
of DAMA/LIBRA–phase1, up to 6 keV. The data of Fig. 1 and those of DAMA/NaI have been ﬁtted
with the function: Acos ω(t − t0), considering a period T = 2π
ω = 1 yr and a phase t0 = 152.5
day (June 2nd) as expected by the DM annual modulation signature. The obtained χ 2/d.o. f . is
130/155 and the modulation amplitude A = (0.00996 ± 0.00074) cpd/kg/keV is obtained. When
the period and the phase are kept free in the ﬁtting procedure, the achieved C.L. for the full ex-

 Time (day)

posure (2.86 ton×yr) is 13.7σ; the modulation amplitude of the single-hit scintillation events is:
(0.01014 ± 0.00074) cpd/kg/keV, the measured phase is (142.4 ± 4.2) days and the measured
period is (0.99834 ± 0.00067) yr, all these values are well in agreement with those expected for
DM particles.

Absence of any signiﬁcant background modulation in the energy spectrum has also been veri-
ﬁed in the present data taking for energy regions not of interest for DM [2–5,9,15–17,19,20]. It is
worth noting that the obtained results account of whatever kind of background and, in addition,
no background process able to mimic the DM annual modulation signature (that is able to simul-
taneously satisfy all the peculiarities of the signature and to account for the measured modulation
amplitude) is available (see also discussions e.g. in Ref. [1–5, 7, 8, 15–17, 19, 20]).

A further relevant investigation on DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 data has been performed by applying
the same hardware and software procedures, used to acquire and to analyze the single-hit residual
rate, to the multiple-hit one. Since the probability that a DM particle interacts in more than one
detector is negligible, a DM signal can be present just in the single-hit residual rate. Thus, the
comparison of the results of the single-hit events with those of the multiple-hit ones corresponds to
compare the cases of DM particles beam-on and beam-off. This procedure also allows an additional
test of the background behaviour in the same energy interval where the positive effect is observed.
While a clear modulation, satisfying all the peculiarities of the DM annual modulation signature,
is present in the single-hit events, the ﬁtted modulation amplitude for the multiple-hit residual
rate is well compatible with zero [20]. Since the same identical hardware and the same identical
software procedures have been used to analyze the two classes of events, the obtained result offers
an additional strong support for the presence of a DM particle component in the galactic halo.

The single-hit residuals have also been investigated by a Fourier analysis [5]. A clear peak
corresponding to a period of 1 year is evident in the low energy intervals; the same analysis in the
(6–14) keV energy region shows only aliasing peaks instead. Neither other structure at different
frequencies has been observed.

The annual modulation present at low energy can also be pointed out by depicting the energy
dependence of the modulation amplitude, Sm(E), obtained by maximum likelihood method con-
sidering ﬁxed period and phase: T =1 yr and t0 = 152.5 day. The modulation amplitudes for the
whole data sets: DAMA/NaI, DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 (total exposure
2.86 ton×yr) are plotted in Fig. 2; the data below 2 keV refer only to the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2

exposure (1.53 ton×yr). It can be inferred that positive signal is present in the (1–6) keV energy
interval (a new data point below 1 keV has been added, see later), while Sm values compatible
with zero are present just above. All this conﬁrms the previous analyses. The test of the hypothesis
that the Sm values in the (6–14) keV energy interval have random ﬂuctuations around zero yields
χ 2/d.o. f . equal to 20.3/16 (P-value =21%).

Figure 2: Modulation amplitudes, Sm, as function of the energy in keV(ee) for the whole
data sets: DAMA/NaI, DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 (total exposure
2.86 ton×yr) above 2 keV; below 2 keV only the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 exposure (1.53
ton × yr) is available and used. A clear modulation is present in the lowest energy
region, while Sm values compatible with zero are present just above. This ﬁgure is being
reused from [20].

It has been veriﬁed that the observed annual modulation effect is well distributed in all the
25 detectors. In particular, the modulation amplitudes Sm integrated in the range (2–6) keV for
each of the 25 detectors for the DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 periods have
random ﬂuctuations around the weighted averaged value conﬁrmed by the χ 2 analysis. Thus, the
hypothesis that the signal is well distributed over all the 25 detectors is accepted.

Among further additional tests, the analysis of the modulation amplitudes separately for the
nine inner detectors and the external ones has been carried out for DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and
DAMA/LIBRA–phase2, as already done for the other data sets [2–5, 15–17, 19, 20]. The obtained
values are fully in agreement; in fact, the hypothesis that the two sets of modulation amplitudes
belong to same distribution has been veriﬁed by χ 2 test, obtaining e.g.: χ 2/d.o. f . =1.9/6 and
36.1/38 for the energy intervals (1–4) and (1–20) keV, respectively (∆E =0.5 keV). This shows
that the effect is also well shared between inner and outer detectors.

To test the hypothesis that the modulation amplitudes calculated for each DAMA/LIBRA–
phase1 and DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 annual cycle are compatible and normally ﬂuctuating around
their mean values, the χ 2 test and the run test have been used. This analysis conﬁrms that the data
collected in all the annual cycles with DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and phase2 are statistically compat-
ible and can be considered together [20].

Let us, ﬁnally, release the assumption of the phase t0 = 152.5 day in the procedure to evaluate

the modulation amplitudes. In this case the signal can be alternatively written as:

Si(E) = S0(E) + Sm(E) cos ω(ti − t0) + Zm(E) sin ω(ti − t0)

(1)

= S0(E) + Ym(E) cos ω(ti − t∗).

For signals induced by DM particles one should expect: i) Zm ∼ 0 (because of the orthogonality
between the cosine and the sine functions); ii) Sm ≃ Ym; iii) t∗ ≃ t0 = 152.5 day. These conditions

4

hold for most of the dark halo models; however, slight differences can be expected in case of
possible contributions from non-thermalized DM components (see e.g. Ref. [19]and references
therein).

Considering cumulatively the data of DAMA/NaI, DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and DAMA/LIBRA–
phase2 the obtained 2σ contours in the plane (Sm, Zm) for the (2–6) keV and (6–14) keV energy
intervals are shown in Fig. 3–left while in Fig. 3–right the obtained 2σ contours in the plane
(Ym, t∗) are depicted. Moreover, Fig. 3 also shows only for DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 the 2σ contours
in the (1–6) keV energy interval. The best ﬁt values are reported in Ref. [20].

in the (1–6) keV energy interval (dark areas, blue on-line). The contours have been
obtained by the maximum likelihood method. A modulation amplitude is present in the
lower energy intervals and the phase agrees with that expected for DM induced signals.
These ﬁgures are being reused from [20].

Setting Sm = 0 in eq. (1), the Zm values have also been determined by using the same proce-
dure for DAMA/NaI, DAMA/LIBRA–phase1 and phase2 data sets; they are expected to be zero.
The χ 2 test supports the hypothesis that the Zm values are simply ﬂuctuating around zero; in fact,
in the (1–20) keV energy region the χ 2/d.o. f . is equal to 40.6/38 corresponding to a P-value =
36%.

No systematic or side processes able to mimic the signature, i.e. able to simultaneously satisfy
all the many peculiarities of the signature and to account for the whole measured modulation
amplitude, has been found or suggested by anyone throughout some decades thus far (for details
see e.g. Ref. [1–5, 7, 8, 15–22]).

In particular, arguments related to any possible role of some natural periodical phenomena
have been discussed and quantitatively demonstrated to be unable to mimic the signature (see
references; e.g. Refs. [7,8]). Thus, on the basis of the exploited signature, the model independent
DAMA results give evidence at 13.7σ C.L. (over 22 independent annual cycles and in various
experimental conﬁgurations) for the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo.

The DAMA model independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of astrophysical, nuclear
and particle physics scenarios for high and low mass candidates inducing nuclear recoil and/or
electromagnetic radiation, as also shown in various literature. Moreover, both the negative re-
sults and all the possible positive hints, achieved so-far in the ﬁeld, can be compatible with the
DAMA model independent DM annual modulation results in many scenarios considering also the

5

 
 
3 FEWARGUMENTSABOUTTHEANALYSISPROCEDURE

existing experimental and theoretical uncertainties; the same holds for indirect approaches. For a
discussion see e.g. Ref. [5, 19]and references therein.

3 Few arguments about the analysis procedure

As reported several times along the years [2–5,15–17,19,20], the data taking of each annual cycle
in DAMA/LIBRA starts before the expected minimum of the DM signal (about 2 December) and
ends after its expected maximum (about 2 June). Thus, adopting in the data analysis a constant
background evaluated within each annual cycle, any possible decay of long–term–living isotopes
cannot mimic a DM positive signal with all its peculiarities. On the contrary, it may only lead to
underestimate the DM annual modulation amplitude, depending on the radio-purity of the set-up.
Despite this obvious fact, Refs. [26, 27]claim that the DAMA annual modulation result might
be mimicked by the adopted analysis procedure. Detailed analyses on this argument have already
been reported in Ref. [19], confuting these claims quantitatively, even considering the case of a
rate at low energy in DAMA/LIBRA with odd behavior, increasing with time.

More recently, Ref. [27]claims that an annual modulation in the COSINE–100 data can appear
if they use an analysis method somehow similar to DAMA/LIBRA. However, as expected from
the rate of COSINE–100 very–decreasing with time and from what mentioned above, the authors
obtain a modulation with reverse phase [27]; this corresponds, when ﬁxing the phase to t0 = 152.5
day, to NEGATIVE modulation amplitudes, as expected by the elementary considerations reported
before. This artiﬁcial effect has no way to mimic the observed DM signature with its peculiarity.

Thus, while the appearance of modulation with NEGATIVE amplitudes is due to the peculiar
behavior of the COSINE–100 rate very–decreasing with time, this is not the case of DAMA/LIBRA.
In particular, the DAMA/LIBRA NaI(Tl) detectors are not the “same” as those of COSINE–100,
since e.g. they were grown starting from different powders, using different puriﬁcation, growing
procedures and protocols; they have been stored underground since decades, they have different
quenching factors for alpha’s and nuclear recoils, etc. Thus, they have well different residual con-
taminations and features1 as well as different electronics and all other details of the experimental
set-up.

Moreover, the stability with time of the running parameters of each DAMA/LIBRA annual
cycle is reported e.g. in Refs. [2–5, 15–17, 19, 20]. As regards the odd idea that the low-energy
rate in DAMA/LIBRA might increase with time due to spill out of noise [27], we just recall two
facts that rule out this possibility: 1) the stability with time of noise, reported in several papers
[2–5,15–17,19,20]; 2) the estimate of the remaining noise tail after the noise rejection procedure
≪ 1% [6].

Finally, the arguments of Ref. [19]already showed that any possible effect in DAMA/LIBRA
due to either long–term time–varying background or odd behavior of the rate, increasing with
time, is negligible. Here we just recall:

• The (2–6) keV single-hit residual rates have been recalculated considering a possible time–
varying background. They provide modulation amplitude, ﬁtted period and phase well com-
patible with those obtained in the original analysis, showing that the effect of long–term
time–varying background – if any – is marginal [19].

1The DAMA/LIBRA set-up had some upgrades – one of them is that from phase1 to phase2 to lower the software

energy threshold – also acting to improve the signal/background ratio.

6

4 PERSPECTIVES,COMPARISONSANDCONCLUSIONS

• Any possible long–term time–varying background would also induce a fake modulation am-
plitudes (Σ) on the tail of the Sm distribution above the energy region where the signal has
been observed. The analysis in Ref. [19]shows that | Σ |< 1.5 × 10−3 cpd/kg/keV. Thus,
taking into account that the observed single-hit annual modulation amplitude at low energy
is order of 10−2 cpd/kg/keV, any possible effect of long–term time–varying background – if
any – is marginal [19].

• The maximum likelihood analysis has been repeated including a linear term decreasing
with time. The obtained S
m averaged over the low energy interval are compared with those
obtained in the original analysis, showing that their differences are well below the statistical
errors [19].

• The behaviour of the multiple-hit events, where no modulation has been found [19, 20]in
the same energy region where the annual modulation is present in the single-hit events,
strongly disfavours the hypothesis that the counting rate has signiﬁcant long–term time–
varying contributions.

Summarizing, the arguments of Ref. [19]already showed that any possible effect in DAMA/ LI-
BRA due either to long–term time–varying background or to any odd behavior of the rate, increas-
ing with time, is negligible and the original analyses, that assume a constant background within
each annual cycle, can be safely adopted. Similar conclusions were also reported in Ref. [28].

4 Perspectives, comparisons and conclusions

To further increase the experimental sensitivity of DAMA/LIBRA and to disentangle some of the
many possible astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics scenarios in the investigation on the DM
candidate particle(s), an increase of the exposure in the lowest energy bin and a further decreasing
of the software energy threshold are needed. This is pursued by running DAMA/LIBRA–phase2
and upgrading the experimental set-up to lower the software energy threshold below 1 keV with
high acceptance efﬁciency.

Firstly, particular efforts for lowering the software energy threshold have been done in the
already-acquired data of DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 by using the same technique as before with dedi-
cated studies on the efﬁciencies. Consequently, a new data point has been added in the modulation
amplitude as a function of energy down to 0.75 keV, see Fig. 2. A modulation is also present below
1 keV. This preliminary result conﬁrms the necessity to lower the software energy threshold by a
hardware upgrade and an improved statistics in the ﬁrst energy bin.

A dedicated hardware upgrade of DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 was done. All the PMTs were equipped
with miniaturized low background new concept preampliﬁers and miniaturized HV dividers mounted
on the same socket. The electronic chain was improved mainly by using higher vertical resolu-
tion 14–bit digitizers. This upgrade aims to improve the experimental sensitivity through a lower
software energy threshold and a large acceptance efﬁciency. The experiment is currently running
in this new conﬁguration, DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 empowered, and new results are foreseen in the
near future.
