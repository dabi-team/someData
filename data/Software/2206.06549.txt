ABSTRACT
Automated test generators, such as search based software testing
(SBST) techniques, replace the tedious and expensive task of manu-
ally writing test cases. SBST techniques are effective at generating
tests with high code coverage. However, is high code coverage
sufficient to maximise the number of bugs found? We argue that
SBST needs to be focused to search for test cases in defective areas
rather in non-defective areas of the code in order to maximise the
likelihood of discovering the bugs. Defect prediction algorithms
give useful information about the bug-prone areas in software.
Therefore, we formulate the objective of this thesis: Improve the
bug detection capability of SBST by incorporating defect prediction
information. To achieve this, we devise two research objectives, i.e.,
1) Develop a novel approach (SBST𝐶𝐿) that allocates time budget
to classes based on the likelihood of classes being defective, and 2)
Develop a novel strategy (SBST𝑀𝐿) to guide the underlying search
algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm) towards the defective areas in
a class. Through empirical evaluation on 434 real reported bugs
in the Defects4J dataset, we demonstrate that our novel approach,
SBST𝐶𝐿, is significantly more efficient than the state of the art SBST
when they are given a tight time budget in a resource constrained
environment.

1 INTRODUCTION
Search based software testing (SBST) has been gaining maturity
not only in research, but also in the industry [19, 21]. Harman
and Jones [20] coined the emerging research area, search based
software engineering (SBSE), which uses search algorithms like
genetic algorithm (GA) to solve software engineering problems.
SBST is a sub-area of SBSE, which specialises in solving software
testing problems like test data generation. Research on SBST dates

back to 1976 [31], and since then it has been seen a growing interest
by the research community [19]. At the same time, SBST has made
its way to the industry as well, i.e., Sapienz at Facebook [2, 30].

Previous work shows that SBST techniques are effective at achiev-
ing high code coverage [33, 34]. However, the more important
question is ‘How does SBST perform in finding real bugs?’. Both
Shamshiri et al. [39] and Almasi et al. [1] showed that SBST out-
performed other approaches in finding real bugs on open source
and industrial projects respectively. However, overall the results
of these studies suggest that SBST methods are not as effective in
finding real bugs. We find that high code coverage is not sufficient
to maximise the number of bugs found.

Defect prediction algorithms predict the areas in software that
are likely to be buggy. They give predictions at file [8, 9, 28], class [4]
or method [6, 15, 22] level. Previous work shows the effectiveness of
defect predictors in locating the buggy areas in software [6, 32, 35].
An effective defect predictor can be used to guide developers to
efficiently test a software system to find bugs [8].

The objective of this thesis is to improve the bug detection per-
formance of SBST by incorporating defect prediction information.
We argue that SBST needs to generate more test cases covering the
defective areas in the code in order to increase the likelihood of
finding bugs. Therefore, we propose to leverage defect prediction
information to inform the search process of the defective areas. To
accomplish our main research objective, we formulate two research
objectives; 1) Develop a novel approach (SBST𝐶𝐿) that allocates
time budget to classes based on the likelihood of classes being de-
fective, and 2) Develop a novel strategy (SBST𝑀𝐿) to guide the
underlying search algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm) towards the
defective areas in a class. Finally, the expected contributions of
this research are 1) a time budget allocation approach that im-
proves bug detection capability of SBST, 2) an analysis of the bug
detection performance improvement of SBST by the time budget
allocation approach when varying the performance of the defect
predictor, 3) a defectiveness-aware search algorithm guidance strat-
egy to improve the bug detection capability of SBST, and 4) an
analysis of the bug detection performance improvement of SBST by
the defectiveness-aware search algorithm guidance strategy when
varying the performance of the defect predictor.

Through empirical evaluation on 434 real bugs from 6 open
source java projects in the Defects4J dataset [25], we demonstrate
the improved efficiency of SBST by our time budget allocation
approach in a resource constrained environment. Further analysis
to the results suggests the improvement of SBST𝐶𝐿 comes from its
ability to find more unique bugs which cannot be found otherwise.

2 MOTIVATING EXAMPLE
The following example illustrates the limitation of SBST focusing
only on high code coverage when using it for finding real bugs. Fig-
ure 1a shows a classic example of a bug due to an integer overflow.
The if condition at line 412 is expected to evaluate to true only
if either u or v is zero. However, if the method is called with the
following inputs u = 1073741824 and v = 1032, then the if condition
at line 412 is evaluated to true since the multiplication of u and v
causes an integer overflow to zero. Fixed code shown in Figure 1b
rectifies this issue by individually checking if u or v are zero. Thus,
in order to detect this bug, a test should pass non-zero arguments
u and v such that their multiplication causes an integer overflow
to zero. A search algorithm [34] focusing on high code coverage is
more likely to find a test case with both/either u and/or v = 0 and
consider this code as covered than find a test case with a pair of u
and v causing an integer overflow to zero. In contrast, we propose
to 1) use defect prediction information to identify bug-prone areas
in the code and 2) guide the search algorithm to find more test cases
covering the bug-prone code to increase the likelihood of finding
the bug.

3 RELATED WORK
Shamshiri et al. [39] and Almasi et al. [1] evaluated EvoSuite [12], a
state of the art SBST tool, against other test generation techniques
on open source and industrial software projects respectively. While
the results of these studies showed that EvoSuite outperformed
the other techniques, overall EvoSuite is not as effective in find-
ing real bugs. In particular, EvoSuite only found on average 23%
bugs from the Defects4J dataset [39]. Both studies used only 100%
branch coverage criterion for the test case search. We argue that
targeting 100% code coverage is not sufficient to find real bugs.
Instead, we propose to guide SBST to search for test cases covering
defective areas in code to maximise the bug detection. Contrary to
these works, we leverage defect prediction information to guide
the search algorithm to extensively explore the search space for
test cases covering defective areas.

Defect predictors employ statistical approaches [6, 32], learning
techniques [15, 18] or risk estimation algorithms [28, 29, 35] etc.
to estimate the likelihood of a file, class or method is defective.
Based on this likelihood and a threshold (e.g., 0.5), they classify if
the component (i.e., class, file or method) is defective or not. As a
result of their efficacy, defect predictors are used in the industry to
assist developers in code reviewing [29] and guide the developers
to efficiently test defective components [8]. Defect predictors can
be useful not only for humans, but also for other automated tools.
Paterson et al. [35] used a defect predictor to inform a test case
prioritisation strategy, G-clef, of the classes that are likely to be

defective and found it is promising. While the predictions are bene-
ficial for developers, the inaccuracies in the estimations (e.g., false
positives) can become costly and inefficient. Our approaches take
this into account when using defect predictions to inform SBST.

4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

RO1: Develop a novel approach (SBST𝐶𝐿) that allocates
time budget to classes based on the likelihood of classes
being defective

SBST techniques such as the ones implemented in EvoSuite [12]
employ a search algorithm such as genetic algorithm (GA) [11]
to generate unit tests for each class independently by spending a
given time budget. This time budget has to be tuned carefully as
it is a stopping criterion for the GA and depends on the available
computational resources in the organisation. Allocating a higher
time budget is beneficial for the search because it allows the search
algorithm to extensively explore the search space of test cases,
thereby increasing the likelihood of finding bugs.

Previous work that studied SBST in terms of finding real bugs
allocated a fixed time budget to all the buggy classes [1, 14, 39].
Ideally, buggy classes should receive more time budget than the non-
buggy ones to maximise the likelihood of finding bugs. Allocating
different time budgets to classes has been explored in previous
research. For example, Campos et al. [7] allocated time budget
to classes based on the complexity of them in order to maximise
branch coverage. In contrast, we propose to allocate time budgets
based on the likelihood of a class being buggy, i.e., classes that are
more likely to be buggy receive a higher time budget, in order to
increase the number of bugs found.

In the first research objective, we simulate defect predictor out-
puts at different performance levels (e.g., Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC)) including an ideal defect predictor to investi-
gate how the bug detection performance of SBST𝐶𝐿 changes with
varying performance levels of defect predictors. An actual defect
predictor comes with some degree of inaccuracy. Thus, we investi-
gate the bug detection performance of SBST𝐶𝐿 when using a real
defect predictor at class level.

RO2: Develop a novel strategy (SBST𝑀𝐿) to guide the un-
derlying search algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm) towards
the defective areas in a class

SBST techniques receive a limited time budget to generate unit
tests for a class. Hence, spending search resources on covering
non-defective parts in the class will deteriorate the bug detection
performance of SBST. GA uses search heuristics (e.g., fitness func-
tion and selection operator) to guide the search to the given ob-
jective. Current state of the art search algorithm, 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴 [34],
employs a preference sorting algorithm to sort the best test cases to
be selected to the next generation in GA. We find that preference
sorting treats each target (i.e., coverage goal) is equally important
and that leads to sub-optimal test suites in terms of finding bugs.
Thus, we plan to use defect prediction at method level to inform
the underlying GA of the buggy methods, hence it can prioritise
the coverage of buggy code over non-buggy code.

Using Defect Prediction to Improve the Bug Detection Capability of Search-Based Software Testing

ASE ’20, September 21–25, 2020, Virtual Event, Australia

As in the RO1, we simulate defect predictor outputs to investi-
gate how the bug detection performance of SBST𝑀𝐿 changes when
varying the performance of the defect predictor. Then, we inves-
tigate the performance of SBST𝑀𝐿 when using an actual defect
predictor at method level.

5 CURRENT STATE OF WORK

Figure 2: SBST𝐶𝐿 Overview

5.1 RO1: Develop a novel approach (SBST𝐶𝐿)

that allocates time budget to classes based
on the likelihood of classes being defective
5.1.1 Motivation. Real-world projects are often very large. For
instance, a modern car has millions of lines of code and thousands
of classes [5]. Thus, running test generation on each individual
class in the project would take significant amount of resources. At
the same time, the available computational resources are limited in
practice [7]. In order for the test generation tool to be adapted in the
continuous integration (CI) system [10] without causing an impact
to the existing processes (e.g., making other jobs idle), the test
generation tool should use as little resources possible. Therefore this
prompts the question, ‘How can we optimally utilise the available
computational resources (e.g., time budget) to generate tests for the
whole project with maximal bug detection?’.

5.1.2 Approach. We propose our novel approach, SBST𝐶𝐿, con-
sisting of three main modules (see Figure 2); i) Defect Predictor, ii)
Budget Allocation based on Defect Scores (BADS), and iii) SBST.
The defect predictor estimates the likelihood of defectiveness for
each class in the project. We call this likelihood a defect score.
BADS takes these defect scores as input and decides how to al-
locate the available time budget to classes based on these scores.
At high level, BADS allocates more time budget for more likely
to be defective classes and less time budget for less likely to be
defective classes. BADS employs an exponential function to highly
favour the budget allocation for a few number of highly likely to
be defective classes. In order to account for inaccuracies present
in defect predictors, we introduce a lower bound for time budget
allocation. This lower bound ensures that every class gets a time
budget allocated regardless of its defect score. Finally, the SBST
module takes these allocated time budgets and runs test generation
for each of the classes. Given its maturity, we use EvoSuite as the
SBST tool and 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴 as the search algorithm.

5.1.3 Evaluation. We answer the following research questions in
order to evaluate SBST𝐶𝐿 in terms of efficiency in finding real bugs
and effectiveness of discovering unique bugs, i.e., bugs that are not
found by the baseline approach.

RQ1.1: Is SBST𝐶𝐿 with simulated defect predictors more efficient in
finding bugs compared to the state of the art?

To investigate the bug detection performance of SBST𝐶𝐿 when
employing defect predictors with different performance levels, we
simulate the defect predictor outputs. Studies on defect prediction
use various metrics to evaluate and compare the models’ perfor-
mance, i.e., recall, precision, accuracy, MCC and AUC etc. [18, 23].
We choose MCC as the performance measure to simulate the defect
predictions as it is insensitive to class imbalance unlike the other
metrics [40]. Class imbalance prevails in defect prediction as there
are only a few number of buggy classes (or methods) compared
to non-buggy ones. We simulate defect predictor outcomes rang-
ing from MCC = 1.0 (i.e., ideal defect predictor) to MCC = 0.0 (i.e.,
random classification).

We choose Defects4J as a suitable benchmark to evaluate our
approach as it is widely used in research [27, 35, 36, 39], and hence
allows us to compare the results to existing work. It contains 835
real bugs from 17 open source java projects [24]. The baseline
for comparison is the state of the art SBST, i.e., 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴, with
fixed time budget allocation. We conduct experiments for 2 cases
of total time budgets (𝑇 ); 15 ∗ 𝑁 and 30 ∗ 𝑁 seconds, where 𝑁 is
the number of classes in the project. We choose these time budgets
for the experiments as 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴 is capable of converging to
the final branch coverage quickly, sometimes with a time budget
like 20 seconds [34]. Also, faster test generation makes SBST more
suitable to fit into the CI/CD pipeline without affecting the existing
processes.

For each bug, we run test generation with the baseline and
SBST𝐶𝐿 using each simulated defect predictor. We repeat the test
generation of each approach for 20 runs to account for randomness
of SBST. Once the test cases are generated, we check if they find the
bugs in the programs, and compare the results of SBST𝐶𝐿 with dif-
ferent simulated predictors against the baseline. We use two-tailed
non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-Test with the significance level
(𝛼) 0.05 [3] and Vargha and Delaney’s (cid:98)𝐴12 statistic [42] to check
the statistical significance of the differences and effect size of the
results (i.e., number of bugs found).

RQ1.2: Does the efficiency of SBST𝐶𝐿 change when using defect
predictors with different performance levels?

To answer this research question, we compare SBST𝐶𝐿 with sim-
ulated defect predictors (MCC < 1.0) against SBST𝐶𝐿 with the ideal
defect predictor (i.e., MCC = 1.0). SBST𝐶𝐿 considers the inaccuracies
present in the actual defect predictors when allocating time bud-
gets to classes. However, the defect predictors having performance
closer to a random classifier (i.e., MCC = 0.0) may deteriorate the
performance of SBST𝐶𝐿.

RQ1.3: Does SBST𝐶𝐿 with simulated defect predictors find more
unique bugs?

In this research question, we investigate if SBST𝐶𝐿 is capable of
finding more unique bugs which cannot be revealed by the baseline
approach. This is an important measure since it indicates the testing
technique is capable to find bugs which cannot be discovered oth-
erwise within the given time budget [17]. The increased efficiency
of SBST𝐶𝐿 could also be due to its robustness, which is measured
by the success rate. Thus, we also analyse how often a bug is found
over 20 runs.

RQ1.4: Is SBST𝐶𝐿 with a real defect predictor more efficient and
effective in finding bugs when compared to the state of the art?
The first three research questions (i.e., RQ1.1-3) investigate the
bug detection performance of SBST𝐶𝐿 using simulated defect pre-
dictors. In this research question, we investigate the performance
of SBST𝐶𝐿 when using an actual defect predictor.

We use Schwa [9, 13], which uses three metrics that have been
shown to be effective in the literature [16, 26, 32, 38], as the de-
fect predictor. Schwa produces defect scores for each class in the
project by using a time weighted risk formula, whereas the other ap-
proaches require to train a classifier using training data. This makes
it ideal to use in an industrial scenario where such training data is
not available. In addition, Paterson et al. [35] successfully leveraged
Schwa in G-clef to inform a test case prioritisation strategy of the
buggy classes.

We run experiments for SBST𝐶𝐿 with Schwa (SBST𝐶𝐿+𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎) as
outlined in RQ1.1. Then, we compare the efficiency and effectiveness
(i.e., finding unique bugs) of SBST𝐶𝐿+𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎 against the state of the
art SBST (i.e., baseline approach).

5.1.4 Results. We are yet to complete the experiments for RQ1.1-3.
For RQ1.4, the empirical evaluation demonstrates that SBST𝐶𝐿+𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎
is significantly more efficient than state of the art SBST when they
are given a tight time budget (𝑇 = 15∗𝑁 seconds) in a usual resource
constrained scenario. In particular, SBST𝐶𝐿+𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎 finds an average
of 13.1% more bugs than the baseline method. However, when there
is sufficient time budget (𝑇 = 30 ∗ 𝑁 seconds), SBST𝐶𝐿+𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎 is
more effective than the state of the art SBST 67% of the time (effect
size = 0.67), which is significant given how hard it is to find failing
test cases [17]. Further analysis to the results tells us that the supe-
rior performance of SBST𝐶𝐿+𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎 is supported by both its ability
to find unique bugs that the baseline could not find and robustness
in finding bugs. More details can be found in our publication [37].

5.2 RO2: Develop a novel strategy (SBST𝑀𝐿) to

guide the underlying search algorithm (i.e.,
genetic algorithm) towards the defective
areas in a class

5.2.1 Motivation. We establish in RO1 that the limited resources
(i.e., time budget) available in practice can be allocated optimally
for test generation of classes in order to maximise the number of
bugs found. However, does the search algorithm spend the allocated
resources (i.e., time budget) to optimally search for test cases that
can reveal the bugs? We find that the current state of the art search
algorithm, 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴, treats each target (i.e., coverage goal) is
equally important to cover. However, the buggy code could exist
in one or few methods, hence we argue that spending the search
resources on covering the non-buggy methods may lead to sub-
optimal test suites in terms of finding bugs.

5.2.2 Approach. We use a defect predictor that works at the method
level. It estimates the likelihood of defectiveness (i.e., defect score)
for each method in a class. We choose state of the art 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴
as the search algorithm in SBST𝑀𝐿. First, SBST𝑀𝐿 uses the de-
fect scores to identify the buggy methods that need to be priori-
tised in the search. Then, all the targets (e.g., branches) in each
buggy method are considered equally important. We introduce a

defectiveness-aware preference sorting algorithm that prioritises
the selection of test cases that are closer to cover the buggy targets
to the next generation in GA. This way SBST𝑀𝐿 can generate more
test cases covering the buggy targets in the class, hence increasing
the likelihood of finding the bug.

5.2.3 Evaluation. We mainly evaluate SBST𝑀𝐿 in terms of effi-
ciency in finding real bugs and effectiveness of revealing unique
bugs against the state of the art, 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴. Similar to RO1, we
plan to carry out the investigation in two parts. First, we study if
the performance of SBST𝑀𝐿 changes when using simulated defect
predictors with varying performance levels. Second, we investigate
the performance of SBST𝑀𝐿 when using an actual defect predictor
that works at method level.

We use the Defects4J dataset as the experimental subjects. Similar
to the experimental protocol outlined in RO1, we run test generation
for each bug with the the baseline and SBST𝑀𝐿 using simulated
and actual defect predictors. We repeat the test generations for 20
runs and conduct statistical tests to check for significance of the
differences of results (i.e., number of bugs found).

5.2.4 Results. We conducted a pilot study on 60 bugs from Apache-
commons Lang project [24]. Our preliminary results show that
SBST𝑀𝐿 with an ideal defect predictor is significantly more efficient
than 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴. In particular, SBST𝑀𝐿 finds an average of 11.13%,
20.5% and 21% more bugs than 𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑀𝑂𝑆𝐴 at 15, 30 and 60 seconds
respectively.

6 FUTURE WORK
We have three future works pertaining to RO1 (RQ1.1-3) and RO2.
In the first research objective, we need to perform the experiments
for SBST𝐶𝐿 with simulated defect predictors and evaluate its per-
formance as outlined in Section 5.1.3.

Second and third future works aim at achieving the second re-
search objective. The outcome of the pilot study suggests the merits
of using defect prediction at method level to guide the search algo-
rithm to find more bugs. Our next step is to incorporate the lessons
learned from the pilot study. This is followed by an empirical eval-
uation as outlined in Section 5.2.3. Upon completing the second
future work, we apply an actual defect predictor that works at the
method level. The existing work on method level defect prediction
suggests several metrics that are effective in producing predictions
[15, 22, 41]. We plan to use these metrics to build a model and use
it in the SBST𝑀𝐿.

7 CONCLUSION
In this thesis, we aim at achieving the main research objective;
Improve the bug detection capability of SBST by incorporating defect
prediction information. Through empirical evaluation on 434 real
bugs in Defects4J dataset, we demonstrate the increased efficiency
of SBST by our time budget allocation approach in a resource con-
strained environment. Preliminary results of the second research
objective shed a positive light on guiding the search algorithm us-
ing the likelihoods of methods being defective in order to find more
bugs. The outcome of RQ1.4 has been accepted at the International
Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) [37].
