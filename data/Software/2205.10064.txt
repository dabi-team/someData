Abstract—Integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
or “drones” into the civil aviation airspace is a problem of
increasing interest in the aviation community, as testiﬁed by many
initiatives developed worldwide. Many traditional surveillance
solutions for manned aircrafts employ the Automatic Dependent
System-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, which however might
present several drawbacks when used for UAVs, especially smaller
ones and/or those ﬂying at very low altitudes. We present in
this paper a cloud-based surveillance solution for UAVs, which
can be considered as an enhancement of a conventional ADS-
B system. The proposed solution leverages inexpensive on-board
transceivers for transmitting positional messages from the UAVs
to the ground. A network of ADS-B gateways, based on the
software-deﬁned radio (SDR) paradigm, format the positional
messages into valid ADS-B signals and rebroadcast them in
the air, allowing thus to emulate a true ADS-B system and
overcoming the main disadvantages of the conventional imple-
mentation. A preliminary performance analysis of the proposed
approach, based on queuing theory, shows the main tradeoffs of
the considered approach. Moreover, a physical-layer laboratory
implementation of the proposed solution is presented, based on
off-the-shelf SDR hardware, which is programmed using the
open-source GNU Radio environment.

I. INTRODUCTION

An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), shortly known as
“drone”,
is an aircraft with no human pilot on-board. It
represents the central element of an Unmanned Aerial System
(UAS), which is the set of the aircraft and all
the other
elements supporting its service. Without the need of an on-
board pilot, drones were originally designed to accomplish
military tasks [1]. However, recent advances in drones’ tech-
nology have allowed the emergence of a wide new range of
applications in the civil domain, as highlighted by the Single
European Skies ATM Research Joint Undertaking (SESAR
JU) in its outlook study [2]. According to such a study, the role
of drones is likely to expand up to 2050 in many civil sectors,

The work of I. Iudice and D. Pascarella was partially supported by the

CIRA project “MATIM”.

including agriculture, energy, public safety and security, e-
commerce and delivery, mobility and transport.

In view of the growing demand for civil drone services
and their impacts in terms of economic growth and societal
beneﬁts, a key problem is to extend traditional Air Trafﬁc
Management (ATM) systems to implement Umanned Aircraft
System Trafﬁc Management (UTM) systems, aimed at safely
and efﬁciently managing small UAVs ﬂying in low airspace.
To this aim, the SESAR JU started the U-space programme in
2016, deﬁned [3] as a set of services and speciﬁc procedures
designed to support safe, efﬁcient and secure access to airspace
for large numbers of drones. A similar evolutionary pathway
is being followed in USA, where UTM is under development
in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)
programme of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [4].
To obtain the required data for ﬂight situational awareness,
UTM systems shall rely upon a surveillance infrastructure,
which considers both the unmanned trafﬁc and its interaction
with manned trafﬁc. Several
initiatives have proposed the
application of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast
(ADS-B) for the safe integration of drones in the civil airspace.
The current ADS-B network infrastructure is composed by
cooperative aircrafts periodically broadcasting their own posi-
tional data1 through Mode-S Extended Squitter (1090 MHz)
ADS-B Out messages [6], and receiving nodes called ADS-B In
using such information for ATM operations and/or providing
global ﬂight tracking services, such as, e.g., Flightradar242.
Each aircraft may in turn be equipped with an ADS-B In
receiver to enhance its on-board situational awareness and to
readily engage separation maneuvers when needed.

ADS-B is already approved for use in civil ATM and
represents a cost-effective surveillance technology with great
potential for novel applications, such as UTM. For example,
the European CORUS (Concept of Operations for European
Unmanned Trafﬁc Management Systems) project has deﬁned
a U-space Concept of Operations (ConOps), wherein ADS-
B is highlighted as a potential surveillance technology for

1Positioning is typically achieved by collecting data from different sensors,
such as GPS, ultrasound, LIDARs, cameras, IMUs, and performing sensor
fusion by means of Kalman ﬁlters [5].

the electronic conspicuity, i.e., a capability that enables the
broadcast or relay of an ownership’s location or position
to other airspace users and ground operators [7]. Moreover,
in their white papers about UTM, Amazon [8] and Google
[9] have proposed ADS-B as an essential asset for safe and
cooperative integration of manned/unmanned trafﬁc.

However, several problems have been identiﬁed when using
standard ADS-B for UTM. For example, the analysis in [10]
indicates a lack of real-time position information at the Very
Low Level (VLL) altitude (under 500 feets), due to the cur-
rent number of on-board ADS-B receivers and transponders,
which is insufﬁcient for the surveillance of high-density drone
operations in an urban airspace. To solve this problem, it is
proposed in [10] to increase the density of ADS-B receivers
for capturing position information, by mandating all aircrafts
to employ ADS-B transponders.

Instead, in [11] it is argued that the integration of ADS-B
as a core part of the future ATM/UTM systems may be com-
promised by issues related to severe message losses (caused
by the growing trafﬁc on the channel) and open security
concerns, due to the cheap and easy availability of Software-
Deﬁned Radio (SDR) devices, which can be easily employed
to sniff, jam or spoof legitimate ADS-B trafﬁc. Another issue
is represented by the power consumption, since standard ADS-
B Out transponders use 200 W transmit power, whereas small
transponders may consume up to 20 W, which is still too
high for a small battery-powered drone [5]. Lastly, specialized
ADS-B transceivers for drones are much more expensive than
drone themselves due to the certiﬁcation processes, and are
affordable only for bigger drones [5].

In this paper, to solve some of the previously proposed
problems, we propose an innovative cloud-based surveillance
solution for UAVs, which is a simple add-on to the con-
ventional ADS-B system. The proposed solution leverages
inexpensive on-board transceivers for transmitting positional
messages from UAVs to the ground. A network of ADS-B
gateways based on the SDR paradigm, after formatting the
positional messages into valid ADS-B signals, rebroadcasts
them in the air, which allows one to emulate a true ADS-B
system. The proposed solution employs SDR techniques at the
gateways, which is a convenient tool for its fast prototyping
and ﬂexibility features. In particular, our SDR implementation
is based on the open-source GNU Radio framework3. A
preliminary performance analysis, in terms of overall system
capacity and latency, is also provided, based on queueing
theory, under some simplifying assumptions.

A. Related work

Different research projects are facing the challenge of
designing ADS-B-based solutions for the surveillance service
in UTM. In general, the addressed solutions represent low-
power ADS-B variants. Indeed, reference [12] provides an
analysis of the impact on ADS-B performance from a shared-
use operation by drones. The analysis indicates that the key

parameters are drones’ ADS-B transmission power and trafﬁc
density, which should be balanced to attain an acceptable
demand on the ADS-B channel in high-density trafﬁc areas.
Within its UTM project, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) has been analyzing the application
of ADS-B for cooperative surveillance of drones since 2015
[13]. For example, one of their research works has provided
detailed simulation results of the ADS-B technology and of
the related detect and avoid (DAA) algorithms in mixed large-
density manned/unmanned environments [14]. Other NASA’s
works regard the Integrated Conﬁgurable Algorithms for Reli-
able Operations of Unmanned Systems (ICAROUS) software
architecture, that is, a set of highly-assured algorithms for
building safety-centric and autonomous application of un-
manned aircrafts in UTM systems [15]. Several ﬂight tests
have been performed for the ICAROUS Sense and Avoid
Characterization (ISAAC) to evaluate [16]: (i) the effectiveness
of ADS-B receivers for drones to receive position reports for
ICAROUS as a source of cooperative trafﬁc surveillance; (ii)
the use of ADS-B for drones. These tests have validated low-
powered ADS-B transmissions (0.4 W) as an option for drone-
to-drone applications.

Moreover, private companies are working on ADS-B vari-
the new drones
ants for drones. For example, nearly all
released by Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) will have the AirSense
feature, which is an alert system to give drone pilots an
enhanced situational awareness about manned aircraft by
means of an ADS-B In component.4 Moreover, uAvionix
is working on small ADS-B transceivers for drones, which
use the commercial frequencies 1090 MHz and 978 MHz
for ADS-B In and 1090 MHz for ADS-B Out.5 However,
ADS-B radio stations are not designed to provide coverage at
VLL altitudes [12]. Considering the limitations introduced by
interferences and by the buildings in urban high-density trafﬁc
environments, it remains unclear how the tracking services will
be implemented in UTM infrastructures [17].

It should be noted that some research groups are investi-
gating alternative solutions for ADS-B like systems, aimed at
replacing ADS-B for UTM [18]. The proposed solutions are
based on different protocols, some of which proprietary ones,
such as FLARM (an acronym based on “ﬂight alarm”), other
based on wireless standards, such as 4G LTE (Long-Term
Evolution), LoRa (Long Range), APRS (Automatic Packet
Reporting System), and others (see [5], [19] and references
therein).

The performance analysis of ADS-B in terms of packet-loss
ratio has been considered in some papers (see e.g. [11], [20]).
The analysis in [11] is based on ADS-B messages recorded
over a 14-day period with a USRP-based receiver. It shows the
impact of several variables, also related to weather conditions,
on the packet-loss ratio, With reference to publicly available
data of the OpenSky network,
in [21] an analysis of the
overall (i.e., system-related) packet loss of ADS-B is derived.

A. Drone on-board system

Drones not equipped with a traditional ADS-B system can
still retrieve their own positional data from the on-board sit-
uational awareness subsystems. After network authentication,
such information is properly encoded, including an identiﬁca-
tion string, and almost-synchronously sent (nearly at 2 Hz,
like in ADS-B) to the ATSs network (i.e., into the cloud)
using an Internet connection, which can be based on different
radio technologies, such as, e.g., 4G/LTE, 5G, WiFi, or LoRa.
Similarly, drones can retrieve information through the same
Internet connection about near aircrafts from the ATSs network
to correctly manage the self-separation procedures.

The most efﬁcient way to implement the communication
protocol between the drones and the ATS is represented by
the Request/Reply paradigm, due to the synchronous commu-
nication needs and the large number of requests that the ATS
server will need to process [22].

B. ADS-B Radio Gateway (ADS-B RG)

The main goal of an ADS-B RG is to receive from the cloud
ATSs network the positional data of the drones belonging
to its operation area, format
it as ADS-B messages, and
rebroadcast, as an ADS-B Out, the resulting ADS-B radio
messages, which are used by both ATM and aircrafts equipped
with conventional ADS-B receivers. Similarly, an ADS-B RG
can work as ADS-B In, by receiving and decoding the ADS-B
radio messages coming from aircrafts under its operation area,
and send the positional data to the ATSs network.

In order to increase the system capacity, a cellular approach
can be used for allowing resource reuse. Indeed, each ADS-B-
RG is associated with a limited coverage area (i.e., a cell). By
reducing the cell dimension, capacity can be efﬁciently scaled,
by allowing the system to serve a larger number of drones.

Since ADS-B off-the-shelf devices have not been designed
to change the aircraft ICAO identiﬁer at run-time. a reconﬁg-
urable transmitter must be developed to this aim. The SDR
paradigm represents a convenient solution to implement such
ADS-B gateways, because of its ﬂexibility features and ease of
programming. Furthermore, SDR allows one to implement an
ADS-B RG by using general-purpose hardware. In particular,
packages for efﬁcient networking are already available as core
modules of the GNU Radio framework. Moreover, tools for
ADS-B message decoding have been developed by the GNU
Radio community as out-of-tree (OOT) modules8.

Since multiple ADS-B RGs could be used to broadcast
the same information, the most efﬁcient way to implement
the communication between ATS nodes and ADS-B RGs is
represented by the Publish/Subscribe paradigm [23].

C. Air Trafﬁc Server (ATS)

ATS nodes receive from drones and ADS-B RGs huge
amounts of positional data about drones and aircrafts equipped
with ADS-B transmitters as request messages. The ATS net-
work must offer high performance in terms of reliability,

In particular, besides providing an accurate assessment with
the packet-loss ratio with

respect to the network congestion is evaluated. The results
conﬁrm that such a congestion is strictly correlated with the
packet-loss ratio.

II. THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

The proposed surveillance solution represents an enhanced
ADS-B network, which leverages the existing ADS-B infras-
tructure, i.e., it can be realized simply by implementing new
features as an add-on to the existing ADS-B network. The
architecture of the proposed network is depicted in Fig. 1,
and comprises three segments:

• Air-segment: it is composed by aircrafts and larger drones
employing ADS-B In/Out devices, as well as smaller
drones connected to the Internet.6

• Ground-segment: it consists of existing ADS-B ground
receivers,7as well as programmable general-purpose
transceivers to be used as Internet-connected ADS-B
Radio Gateways (ADS-B RGs).

• Cloud-segment: it is based on strongly reliable Internet
air trafﬁc servers (ATSs) intended for authenticating,
queuing, processing, and routing massive amounts of
positional data.

In the following, we describe in more detail the functional
requirements of the systems and devices required by the
innovative architecture.

6Each drone could be directly connected to the Internet, by means of
different radio technologies. Alternatively, the pilot ground station can be
used as an Internet gateway.

7The ADS-B protocol also provides ground transmission nodes, however

they are not used for transmitting positional data [6].

Let Pmax (cid:44) maxk∈{1,2,...,K} Pk, it must be λPmax < µ
to assure system stability. Since the ATSs use inﬁnite-length
queues, the system blocking probability PB will be zero. The
average number N of requests and the average waiting time
T of requests in the system can be evaluated as

with the stability condition becoming λ < Kµ.

According to the ADS-B protocol, positional messages are
sent every 0.5 s, i.e., the transmitting rate produced by each
ADS-B user is RADS-B = 2 Hz. Such a condition allows one
to set an upper-bound for the system capacity:

Nmax <

Kµ
RADS-B

(5)

with Nmax denoting the maximum amount of users that can
be served. As readily seen by (3) and (4), when K increases
a saturation effect of the performance parameters is observed,
i.e., the average waiting time boils down to the time duration
1/µ of a single ADS-B message.

As stated in [21], the packet-loss ratio is strictly related to
the overall system capacity and congestion: a higher aircraft
congestion entails a larger number of collisions on the commu-
nication link, i.e., a higher probability for the transmitters to
choose overlapping time slots for the transmissions. The per-
formance analysis reported above does not consider possible
collisions with ADS-B signals coming from legacy devices. In
this respect, since ADS-B-RGs are intended to be implemented
using the SDR paradigm, Carrier Sensing Multiple Access
(CSMA) could be a suitable technique for managing the
packet-loss ratio, introducing a controlled degradation in terms
of system capacity. In this case, more complicated approaches
should be used for modeling the queueing stack and evaluating
performances.

Simpliﬁed queueing model (parallel M/D/1 queues) for the

availability, and security [24], [25]. The positional datum
received by a drone is encoded following the correct ADS-
B data format [6] and readily published to be made available
to the ADS-B RGs covering the airspace near the drone itself.
In the meantime, each ATS node is able to retrieve air trafﬁc
information about the airspace the drone is covering from
both ADS-B RGs and the global ﬂight tracking services, and
encapsulate them into the reply messages for enhancing the
drone situational awareness.

III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

To obtain some simple analytical results, we consider only
the broadcast information coming from drones and transmitted
by the ADS-B-RGs. It can be shown that for the reverse
path, i.e., the ﬂow from the aircrafts equipped with ADS-B
transmitters to the drones, a similar modeling approach can
be used.

The following assumptions and notations are considered
in the analysis: (i) K ADS-B-RGs operate on distinct cells;
(ii) the global requests are memoryless with rate λ; (iii) Pk
represents the probability that one request is received from
the cell covered by the k-th ADS-B-RG; (iv) all the ADS-
B-RGs operate at the deterministic service rates µ1 = µ2 =
. . . = µK = µ = (1/120) · 106 s−1 (the duration of an ADS-
B message is 120 µs); (v) all the service queues are inﬁnite-
length.

We refer to the queueing model of Fig. 2, which represents
an architecture where the network of ATSs implements the
association between requests and ADS-B-RGs, on the basis
of both coverage and positional information, and manages
the ADS-B-RG queues. Since the association depends on the
users distribution within the covered area, which is not known
in advance, we considered a model composed by K parallel
M/D/1 queues9, where the k-th queue is characterized by the
arrival rate λPk and the service rate µk = µ.

9Following Kendall notation [26], [27], M/D/1 stands for an inﬁnite
dimension queue characterized by memoryless arrivals, deterministic service
rate, and a single server.

10The average number of requests in the system can be also obtained from
the average waiting time of requests in the system exploiting the Little’s
theorem [28], i.e., N = λT .

number of served drones.

function of the number of served drones.

uniformly distributed drones among the covered area for
different numbers of ADS-B-RGs, i.e., K ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10, 100}.
Fig. 3 shows the average number of requests in the system as
a function of the number of served drones. It can be readily
noted that, although the stability condition is granted, when
the number of drones to be served approaches the maximum
system capacity the number of requests in the system dramat-
ically increases. A similar behavior can be observed for the
average waiting time of requests in the system (normalized
to 1/µ), reported in Fig. 4. as a function of the number of
served drones. In particular, this curve shows that K needs to
be properly designed to accommodate the latency constraints
of the ADS-B standard.

B. Experimental results

For a ﬁrst proof-of-concept of the approach, experimental
results have been focused on the advances in physical-layer
technologies. Speciﬁcally, as stated in section II-B, the TX
segment of an ADS-B RG has been implemented from scratch
as an OOT module into the GNU Radio (v3.8) framework
running under Rocky Linux (v8.5). In order to test our ADS-
B SDR implementation, a simple C++ application emulating
the message passing between the ATS and the ADS-B RG was
also developed.

The ADS-B RG TX segment gets the asynchronous ADS-B
messages to be transmitted as subscriber of the ATS publisher
using the ZeroMQ networking library11, already embedded in
GNU Radio. Each ADS-B message (112 bit) is ﬁrst PPM-
binary modulated at 1 MBaud. Then, a short preamble is
added, such that a burst of 120 µs is obtained [6]. The output
burst coming from the aforementioned ADS-B modulator has
to be served at 2 MHz; if the sample rate of the ﬂowgraph
needs to be set at an higher frequency, an upsampling proce-
dure must be provided.

Two functional experiments have been carried out: the ﬁrst
one considers a “loopback” GNU Radio Companion ﬂow-
graph, aimed at validating the correctness of the modulated
burst using the ADS-B decoding library provided by the gr-
adsb module12. The second experiment implements the entire
ADS-B RG transmitting chain, with the actual RF signal
generated by using an Ettus USRP E31013 as RF front-end
and the driver module gr-iio provided by Analog Devices14.
The resulting RF signal is demodulated and decoded using a
commercial ADS-B receiver (Garrecht Avionik GmbH TRX-
1090 ADS-B Receiver).

CONCLUSION

In this paper we presented a proof-of-concept of a cloud-
assisted network for the integration of cooperative small UAVs
in the ADS-B surveillance system for unmanned trafﬁc man-
agement. With respect to state-of-the-art solutions belonging to
the class of ADS-B like systems, the proposed solution is not
aimed at replacing ADS-B and does not introduce a different
surveillance protocol. Instead, it preserves the current ADS-B
network, while integrating and enriching it with cloud-based
features to include in the civil airspace those ﬂying vehicles
that cannot host ADS-B transceivers.

The proposed solution heavily relies on cloud-computing
infrastructures, as an extension of the current ADS-B infras-
tructure. Indeed, cloud computing allows efﬁcient processing
of massive amounts of positional data, solving also some
security issues related to the authentication of managed ve-
hicles, by means of network authentication services. Finally,
due to their ﬂexibility and efﬁcient networking features, the
interface between ADS-B network and cloud infrastructures is
implemented by SDR devices acting as ADS-B gateways.

In future work, the functionalities of the cloud segment
should be implemented in detail into the simulation setup.
Moreover, an exhaustive evaluation of the attainable perfor-
mances (in terms, e.g., of network capacity, message loss, and
latency) should be carried out, which would take into account
the actual legacy ADS-B data trafﬁc and the processing delay
at each network node.
