ABSTRACT 

This  paper  applies  a  classical  physics-based  model  to  control  platooning AVs  in  a  commercial  traffic 
simulation software. In Spring-Mass-Damper model, each vehicle is assumed as a mass coupled with its 
preceding vehicle with a spring and a damper: the spring constant and damper coefficient control spacing 
and  speed  adoption  between  vehicles.  Limitations  on  platooning-oriented  communication  range  and 
number of vehicles in each platoon are applied to the model to reflect real-world circumstances and avoid 
overlengthened platoons. The SMD model control both intra-platoon and inter-platoon interactions. Initial 
evaluation of the model reveals that the SMD model does not cause a negative spacing error between AVs 
in  a  harsh  deceleration  scenario,  guaranteeing  safety.  Besides  that,  the  SMD  model  produces  a  smaller 
positive  average  spacing  error  than  VISSIM  built-in  platooning  module,  which  prevents  maximum 
throughput drop. The simulation result for a regular highway section reveals that the proposed platooning 
algorithm increases the maximum throughput by 10%, 29%, and 63% under 10%, 50%, and full market 
penetration rate of AVs with 0.5 sec response time. A merging section with different volume combinations 
on the main section and merging section and different market penetration rates of AVs is also modeled to 
test inter-platoon spacing policy effectiveness in accommodating merging vehicles. Travel time reductions 
of  20%  and  4%  are  gained  under  low  MPR  of  AVs  on  the  mainlane  and  merging  lane  accordingly. 
Meanwhile, a more noticeable travel time reduction is observed in both mainline and merging lanes and 
under all volume combinations in higher AVs' MPR.

INTRODUCTION 

Due to rapid population growth and the increased number of vehicles, traffic congestion, collisions, and 
pollution have become leading causes of decreased living standards. Only in 2017 and in the USA, traffic 
congestion has caused 8.8 billion hours of delay and 3.3 billion gallons of fuel waste, resulting in a total 
cost of 179 billion USD (1). Traffic congestion has increased between 1 and 3 percent annually from 2008 
to 2017 in the USA, and a national congestion cost of 237 billion USD is forecasted for 2025 (1). Data from 
several studies prove that human errors play a pivotal role in traffic congestion and accidents, and driver 
error contributes to up to 75% of all roadway crashes worldwide (2). The global rate of road traffic death is 
18.2 per 100.000 population. However, there is significant variation across different regions; the USA and 
Europe hold the lowest regional rates with 15.6 and 9.3 death per 100.000 population, respectively (3).  

With  advances  in  communication  and  sensing  technology  within  the  last  decade,  vehicles  are 
equipped  with  several  driving  assistant  systems  such  as  Adaptive  Cruise  Control  (ACC),  blind-spot 
monitors, back-up cameras, and lane centering. Some high-end cars produced within the last couple of years 
can  perform  most  driving  tasks  without  human  driver  interference,  and  the  imminent  widespread 
appearance of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) on the streets is expected. The most crucial 
feature  of  CAVs  seems  to  be  the  communication  capability.  The  CAVs’  communication  capability  is 
promising in congestion relief and safety improvement at roadway facilities. Several previous studies have 
approved that the shorter following gap time between CAVs gained by Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control 
(CACC) systems can increase the roadway segment capacity up to 100% (4). It also can improve traffic 
safety by eliminating human errors, which is one of the leading causes of traffic accidents.  

Development of CAV’s longitudinal control systems has been a point of interest for more than two 
decades, and several CACC control systems have been developed within this time. A noticeable portion of 
studies is focused on the dynamics aspect of CACC, such as vehicle mass, tire friction, vehicle powertrain. 
These  aspects  are  vital  in  bringing  CACC  to  fruition  yet  providing  limited  insights  into  the  impacts  of 
CACC  on  the  overall  traffic  network. Alternatively,  most  of  the  models  developed  explicitly  for  traffic 
assessment of CACC have missed several critical aspects of platooning such as platoon evolution process, 
communication range limitations, or interactions between platoons.  

In this study, the SMD model is applied to control platooning AVs. The SMD model consists of 
discrete  mass  nodes  interconnected  via  a  network  of  springs  and  dampers. This  concept  describes  how 
objects reduce their oscillation based on the spring constant, damper coefficient, and mass (5). SMD model 
is used in several research areas over the last few years, such as analyzing the stability of wind turbines in 
power  and  energy system engineering (6),  vibration analysis  of  beam-like  structures  in  mechanical  and 
structure science (7) (8), modeling human organ movements in biomechanics (9), analysis of pulsation in 
heat pipes in thermal engineering (10), and pedestrian crossing behavior modeling (11). Developing CAV’s 
platooning  logics  based  on  Spring-Mass-Damper  (SMD)  system  dates  back  to  the  late  1990s,  and  few 
researchers have deployed this model for the same purpose since then. SMD model incorporates the most 
critical dynamic aspect of vehicles, the mass, and covers the platoon evolution process. Other aspects such 
as communication range, limitations on maximum platoon length, and interactions between platoons are 
reflected in the model in this study.  

The SMD model has been previously used to control platooning AVs (12). The main contribution 
of this study is developing a more realistic logic by setting a maximum platooning-oriented communication 
range  for  the  AVs  and  proposing  a  real-world-compatible  platooning  behavior  by  dividing  strings  of 
vehicles  into  sub-platoons  to  avoid  lengthy  platoons  and  accommodate  potential  merging  vehicles. 
Meanwhile, the SMD model controls both inter-platoon and intra-platoon interactions. The proposed model 
is  coded  into  commercial  simulation  software  to  facilitate  traffic-oriented  and  potential  macroscopic  or 
mesoscopic assessments. 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

With the emergence of CAVs and taking advantage of communication capabilities within the last decade, 
conventional ACC  systems  have  evolved  to  CACC  systems  (13).  CACC-equipped  vehicles  can  share 

 
 
4 

information with other vehicles and the controller unit; this feature enables the controller to provide safer, 
smoother, and more natural responses (14). Despite being designed to give the driver more comfort and 
convenience,  CACC  can increase traffic throughput and  safety  by allowing  a shorter  headway  between 
vehicles and platoon formation (15). Since connectivity between vehicles will be mandatory for the new 
cars  in  the  USA  shortly,  CACC  systems  attract  lots  of  attention  from  academia  and  industry  (16). A 
noticeable number of transportation engineering studies are involved with developing CACC longitudinal 
control system  and  assessing  its  impacts on  the  transportation  system. A  literature  review  of  developed 
CACC models and their impact on traffic measures is presented in the following sections.  

CACC Models and their Impact on Traffic Measures  

One of the first studies assessing the impact of CACC on traffic flow was conducted by Shaldover et al. 
(17). In this study, the distribution of time gap between vehicles was collected from human-driven CACC 
and ACC-equipped vehicles in a field test. According to the test results, in ACC mode, drivers were unlikely 
to adopt a gap smaller than what they choose in manual driving mode. A simulation platform was built-in 
AIMSUN to compare ACC and CACC based on the car-following time gap derived from the field test. A 
simplified version of ACC and CACC car following models were deployed to reduce computational efforts. 
ACC car-following rules were complying with Nissan cars, and the CACC model was derived from (18), 
which has two main components: 1) speed control mode, which kept the vehicle's speed close to the speed 
limit,  and  2) the gap  control  mode,  which maintained  the  desired  gap  between  pair  of cars.  Simulation 
results on a single-lane straight freeway under different Market Penetration Rates (MPR) of CACC and 
ACC revealed that ACC is unlikely to produce a significant change in highway capacity. However, CACC 
can noticeably increase highway capacity in moderate to high MPRs, as the higher dynamic response gives 
the driver confidence to adopt a shorter gap setting.  

Van Arem et al. (19) studied the impact of CACC on a four-lane highway merging section in the 
MIXIC  microscopic  traffic  simulation  model,  which  simulates  traffic  on  link-level  in  a  network.  The 
functions  for  CACC  acceleration  and  distance  control  were  derived  from  (20).  The  acceleration  was 
calculated based on distance and speed difference with the ago vehicle. The clearance length was a function 
of the speed and deceleration capability of the preceding vehicle and the declaration capability of the target 
vehicle. This study revealed that a high MPR of CACC enhances highway capacity after a lane drop section 
with a relatively high volume. However, since the communication was limited to longitudinal control, with 
no control on the length and compactness of CACC platoons, CACC vehicles prevented other vehicles from 
cutting in. Moreover, the impact of a dedicated lane for CACC vehicles also depends on CACC MPR, a 
CACC MPR of less than 40% results in more significant speed variance and more shockwaves.  

Zonuzy et al. designed a CACC control logic with space-based model parameters to improve CACC 
platoons merging maneuver (21). The idea was to assign each vehicle on the sub-stream to a pair of vehicles 
on the mainstream, then adjusting the time gap and velocity of vehicles on the mainstream to accommodate 
the merging vehicle. The vehicle's control logic was based on nonlinear systems dynamic theory from (22) 
to  guarantee  both  string  stability  and  single-vehicle stability. The  control  model  inputs  were  set as pre-
designed time gap versus location and velocity versus location profiles. Time gap profiles were designed to 
ensure vehicles maintain a safe time gap and a minimum deceleration distance to prevent performance drop 
or safety issues. The numerical simulation results revealed that deploying the target profiles and control 
logic ensures string stability for platooning CACCs. However, vehicles from the sub-stream need to be 
positioned at the correct location between the mainstream sub-platoons to ensure that minor errors would 
not appear at the merging point.  

Lee et al. (23) developed a CACC control logic based on a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem 
(MOOP)  approach.  Four  objective  functions  were  selected  to  be  optimized,  1)  Target  time  headway 
deviation,  to  control  platoon  formation  time  and  make  sure  the  platoon  is  stabilized  under  traffic 
disturbances, 2) Unsafe condition, to make sure each pair of cars attain the minimum required headway to 
secure safety, 3) Vehicular Jitter, to minimize switch between acceleration and deceleration and avoid a 
drastic change in any of them and improve comfort, 4) Fuel consumption, to reduce fuel consumption and 
environmental pollution. A genetic algorithm was deployed to optimize four main objective functions along 

 
5 

with additional  constraints. The  output of optimization  was  used as control logic  for  platooning  CACC 
vehicles by controlling their acceleration. Simulation Results of a single lane 14.5 km freeway segment in 
VISSIM  software  with  three  different  target  time  headway  values  revealed  that  MOOP  CACCs  with  a 
longer target time headway yield better performance in time headway deviations. However, a shorter time 
headway provided more throughput. It was also revealed that MOOP keeps a good balance between all 
objective  functions  compared  to  Single  Objective  Optimization  Problem  (SOOP)  since  the  SOOP 
performed biased with a limited search space for optimization.  

SMD-based Longitudinal Vehicle’s Control Logic  

In  1998  Eyre  et  al.  (24)  used  an  SMD  system  with  linear  characteristics  to  evaluate  platooning AVs' 
longitudinal string stability properties. They considered two types of interactions: 1) unidirectional, each 
vehicle being connected only to its predecessor without being affected by its follower, and 2) bidirectional, 
each vehicle being coupled with both proceeding and following vehicles. Two different spacing policies 
were  examined:  1)  constant  space  policy  and  2)  speed-dependent  spacing  policy.  Simulation  results  of 
autonomous commercial trucks revealed that: 1) the unidirectional controller only achieves stability if it is 
used  with  speed-dependent  policy,  2)  bidirectional  controller  with  the  constant  spacing  policy  achieves 
stability only for a specific range of SMD model hyperparameters, 3) in case of speed-dependent spacing 
policy, the bidirectional controller showed the most efficient performance if space was only is adjusted with 
predecessor vehicle.   

Contet et al. (25) studied a single platoon of three vehicles controlled by SMD logic, longitudinally 
and  laterally.  Two  simulation  scenarios  were  developed  to  analyze  trajectory  spacing  error.  1)  while 
maneuvering  to  avoid  an  obstacle  and  2)  after  accommodating  a  merging  vehicle.  Simulation  results 
revealed that the platooning vehicles could successfully avoid the obstacle, and no unsafe spacing error is 
produced in any scenario. A physical experiment was also performed by running soccer robots in a prototype 
playground, and spacing errors were collected while facing speed constraints or moving in curved paths. 
The simulation results confirmed the flexibility and adaptability of the model. Neither in the numerical 
simulation nor the physical experiment, real-world roadway circumstances were not adopted this study.  

Munigety  et  al.  (26)  performed  a  sensitivity  analysis  on  the  SMD  model  to  its  three  primary 
hyperparameters,  including  mass,  spring  constant,  and  damper  coefficient. They  proved  that  the  spring 
constant and damper coefficient could represent driver aggressiveness and vehicle stability accordingly. It 
was also demonstrated that speeding capability reduces as the vehicle's mass increases. By simulating a 
single lane 300m roadway in MATLAB, speed-flow diagrams for four different vehicle types (motorbike, 
auto-rickshaw,  car,  truck)  were  derived.  It  was  revealed  that  as  the  vehicle  size  increases,  the  roadway 
capacity decreases.  

Bang et al.  (27) developed a strategy for AV platoon evolution by reflecting swarm intelligence 
theory to the SMD model. The swarm intelligence theory describes animals' clustering behavior, such as 
bird flocking and fish schooling. It also describes the molecular behavior of materials in different phases, 
including gas, liquid, and solid. (28).  In this study, the spring constant was defined as functions of traffic 
flow, and the damper coefficient was defined as a function of spring constant, mass, and vehicle response 
time  functions.  Simulation  results  revealed  that  the  spring  constant  represents  the  tendency  for  platoon 
formation or clustering time, and the damping coefficient represents the stability or oscillation of vehicles. 
Efficient spring constant and damping coefficient functions for minimizing clustering time in high flow 
circumstances or providing more freedom for lane changing in low volume circumstances were introduced.  
Bang et al. (29) also studied platoon stability at merging sections. The idea was to adjust the spring 
constant and damping coefficient for the cut-in vehicle and its follower to minimize the cut-in movement's 
impact. The spring constant and damping coefficient for the cut-in vehicle and its immediate follower were 
defined as functions of spacing and speed difference between the two vehicles. Consequently, the cut-in 
vehicle and its follower would maintain a lower spring constant, allowing them to adopt a temporary shorter 
spacing  and  higher  damper  coefficient,  which  reduces  speed  disturbance  since  the  vehicle  matches  the 
leader's speed more quickly. The simulation results for merging sections showed that the speed and spacing 
variation and recovery time diminishes significantly with the proposed control.

Summary 

Although few researchers have considered the SMD model to develop a longitudinal car-following model, 
this model seems to be a well-fitting logic for this purpose. Unlike transportation engineering-oriented car-
following models, the SMD model does not miss the most critical dynamic aspect of vehicles: the mass. 
Simultaneously, the model is not overinvolved with the vehicles’ dynamic aspects and can still be used for 
traffic assessment purposes. The SMD model can reflect driver aggressiveness and vehicle stability. Some 
researchers  have  used  the  SMD  model  to  develop  conventional  car-following  models  (24)  (25)  (26). 
Furthermore, few SMD-based CACC models have been proposed, mainly focusing on sensitivity analysis 
of SMD model hyperparameter and missing the practical aspects of the CACC systems such as maximum 
communication range and platoon length (27) [28]. However, this study intends to develop a more realistic 
CACC  model,  by  setting  limitations  on  the  maximum  platooning-oriented  communication  range  and 
platoon length.  

METHODOLOGY 
This section presents the fundamentals and parameters settings of the SMD model.  

SMD System and Vehicle Platooning 

The SMD model describes how objects maintain desired spacing and speed. It also describes how objects 
reduce their oscillations based on spring constant, damping coefficient, and object’s mass (30). Figure 1 
illustrates the SMD system for n objects or vehicles. 

Figure 1 n-body SMD system (30) 

It  is  assumed  that  the  friction  between  vehicles  and  surfaces  is  negligible,  and  each  mass  is 
connected only to its predecessor and not affected by its follower. Based on the assumptions, the forces 
acting on the leading mass and following masses in a string are expressed in Equation (1) and Equation (2) 
(30).

The  variables  𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑥  and  𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 are  the  maximum  acceleration  and  deceleration  capability  of 
vehicles. According to the characteristics of Ford Fusion, 2019 Hybrid, presented in Table 1 (31), 𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑥 
equals to 3.7 𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑐2, and 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 equals to 9.023 𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑐2. Inserting 𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑚, and assuming desired 
speed equal to 120 km/hr. 

,   𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥  will  be equal to  229.67. To  achieve  the  desired  speed in the shortest possible  time, the 

maximum value for 𝑐 is assumed in this study.

The  unstretched  spring  length  (𝑙)  represents  the  minimum  neutral  spacing  for  speed  𝑣  and  is 
calculated based on Newell’s simplified car-following model (32). The 𝑙 value’s function is presented in 
Equation (5). Considering 𝑙 as desired spacing for specific speed, the term (𝑥𝑛−1 − 𝑥𝑛 − 𝑙) in the model 
represents deviation from desired spacing.

The AVs processing time (𝜏) ranges from 0.5 to 1 sec (4), while Human-Driven Vehicles (HDV) 
reaction  time  ranges  from  1.5  to  2  sec  (33).  The  parameter  𝑠0 represent  bumper  to  bumper  clearance 
between two standstill vehicles which is assumed equal to 2 meters.

Characteristics of Spring Constant and Damping Coefficient  

The spring constant, 𝑘𝑖 represents the spring stiffness. A spring with a larger 𝑘 is harder to stretch or shrink, 
but once stretched or shrunk, there is a greater force to recover its original length. Thus, a large 𝑘 represents 
a stiff spring with a high body acceleration (high frequency). In contrast, a small 𝑘 represents a limp spring 
with low acceleration (low frequency). The spring constant in the SMD model is the coefficient of ∆𝑥𝑛 and 
is regarded as an AVs’ sensitivity to deviation from its desired spacing with the ago vehicle.  

The damping coefficient, 𝑏𝑖 represents the degree of resistance that alleviates the spring force. The 
damping force defines how a following AV approaches its predecessor and adjusts its speed based on the 
ago  vehicle’s  speed.  For  example,  with  a large  b,  it  takes longer  for  the  following  vehicle  to  attain  the 
desired distance, but the speed might be adjusted faster. Meanwhile, with a smaller b, an AV attains the 
desired distance faster by oscillating in location and speed. The damping coefficient in the SMD model is 
the  coefficient  of  deviation  from  desired  spacing  and  can  be  regarded  as  an AV’s  sensitivity  to  speed 
deviation from its ago vehicle. The desired spacing is a function of speed, and AV’s processing time, derived 
from Equation (5). 

Harmony  between  the  spring  constant  and  damping  coefficient  is  essential  for  the  stability  and 
efficiency of AV platooning. The critical values lead to the shortest time to attain  𝑙  without collision or 
oscillations, called critical-damping. Two more possible damping types are 1) under-damping, which is not 
desirable since vehicles would oscillate back and forth before reaching 𝑙, and 2) over-damping, which takes 
longer to reach L, but there is no oscillation. According to [22], conditions of critical-damping and over-

damping  can  be  achieved  if  b  ≥ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (

𝑚

, √ 𝑘

),  and  the  system  would  be  critical-damping  if  b  =  

𝑚𝑎𝑥 (

). If we assume that ∆𝑥. = 0, meaning that the force is only coming from the spring, the upper 

bound for 𝑘, which provides the greatest spring force, and makes vehicles cluster quickly, is obtained as 
follows:

Parameters Setting  

(6) 

A maximum platooning-oriented communication range equal to 4𝑙 is assumed for AVs. So, as the speed 
increases, the chance of forming a platoon with a further ago vehicle increases too. Each platoon is divided 
into  several  sub-platoons  to  avoid  very  long  platoons  and  accommodate  potential  merging  vehicles. 
According to the sensitivity analysis between platoon length and maximum throughput presented in the 
proof-of-concept  test  section,  a  maximum  throughput  increment  of  3%  is  gained  if  the  platoon  length 
increases from 4 vehicles to 12 vehicles with a 0.5 sec processing time. Therefore, the maximum platoon 
length is assumed to be four vehicles to facilitate merging maneuvers. The leading vehicle of each platoon 
communicates with the last vehicle of the predecessor platoon and, inter-platoon desired spacing is set equal 
to 3𝑙. 

The  maximum  value  for  spring  constant  and  critical  value  for  damper  coefficient,  presented  in 

Equations (7) and (8), are used in the model to minimize clustering time.

Different  vehicle  types  in  the  model  based  on  the  distance  between  them  and  their  platooning 

circumstances are shown in Figure 2. 

-  Vehicle 1: leading vehicle of a platoon, with having no ago vehicle in the communication range, 
equation (1) defines this vehicle's acceleration, and it keeps accelerating to maintain the desired 
speed as long as it does not detect any other vehicle in the communication range. 

-  Vehicle  2  and  4:  following  vehicles  in  a  sub-platoon,  maintaining  the  intra-platoon  desired 

spacing (𝑙), and the acceleration is derived from Equation (2).  

-  Vehicle  3:    leading  vehicle  of  a  sub-platoon,  either  its  sub-platoon  or  its  predecessor  sub-
platoon, has reached the maximum length. So, this vehicle maintains inter-platoon spacing (3𝑙) 
with  its  ago  vehicle  within  the  communication  range,  and  the  acceleration  is  derived  from 
Equation (2). 

-  Vehicle 5: having no vehicle in the communication range and maintaining the desired speed 

based on Equation (1).

Microsimulation Testbed Development  

The  SMD-based  AVs’  platooning  logic  is  developed  in  Python  and  integrated  with  VISSIM  traffic 
microsimulation software. The VISSIM stochastically produces vehicles and directs them through specified 
routes. It also controls potential human-driven vehicles based on the Wiedemann 99 car-following model 
(34), and collects traffic measures such as delay and travel time. The python program collects vehicle data 
such as location and speed, establishes communication between vehicles, and controls AVs’ acceleration 
based on the SMD model.  The Common Object Model (COM) interface allows the python program to 
access the simulation network's data and objects during simulation. Adjusting editable objects and variables 
such as traffic volume and individual vehicle’s speed is also possible in the COM interface.  The process of 
integrating VISSIM and Python through the COM interface is shown in Figure 3.

PROOF OF CONCEPT TESTS 

Spacing Error 

The spacing error between platooning vehicles refers to the difference between actual and desired inter-

 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

vehicle spacing. The desired spacing is derived from Equation (5) for the SMD model. The spacing error is 
expected to be nonzero if the preceding vehicle is accelerating or decelerating (12). A negative spacing error 
is considered a safety threat, and a positive value will result in a capacity drop. For the initial evaluation of 
the model, platooning vehicles are exposed to a sudden deceleration scenario, and the average spacing error 
between AVs is collected. In this scenario, a string of 20 AVs (consisting of 5 platoons of 4 vehicles) is 
following an HDV which suddenly decelerates with a rate of 5.5 𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑐2  and decrease its speed from 120 
km/hr to 30 km/hr. The average spacing error between platooning vehicles is collected over time. VISSIM’s 
built-in A.V. platooning model added to VISSIM since the 2020 version is adopted as a counterpart of the 
SMD model. However, the details of the VISSIM’s built-in platooning model are unknown, considering 
that  modeling  another  platooning  logic  in  VISSIM  is  highly  time-consuming  and  requires  lots  of 
programming; the VISSIM built-in model is selected as a counterpart of SMD for initial proof of concept 
test.  

The adjustable platooning parameters for the VISSIM built-in model and the SMD model are shown 
in Table  2;  as  shown in  the  table,  the  parameters  are  identical  between  the  two  models.  Except  for  the 
maximum  platooning-oriented  communication  range,  which  is  set  to  35  meters  in  the VISSIM  built-in 
model, it is impossible to define this value as a speed function like what we did for the SMD model.

Figure 4 Spacing error occurrence in harsh deceleration scenario 

According to the results, minor positive errors (less than one meter) are constantly observed for the 
VISSIM  built-in  model  while  following  an  HDV  driver.  An  increasing  error  appears  as  soon  as  the 
deceleration phase starts and reaches the climax of 8 meters at the end of the deceleration phase. After 10 
seconds of moving with constant speed, the spacing error is reduced to the minimum value. However, no 
error is observed regularly in the SMD model, and a maximum error of 1.5 meters is observed at the end of 
the deceleration phase. The advantage of both models is that no negative spacing error is observed, which 
is equivalent to a safety threat. However, noticeable positive errors are observed in VISSIM built-in model, 
which results in a maximum capacity drop.  

Maximum Throughput Assessment  

A single-lane highway with a length of 4 kilometers is modeled in VISSIM to evaluate the proposed model's 
impact on the roadway's maximum throughput under different AVs’ MPR and processing time (𝜏). HDVs 
are  controlled  by VISSIM’s  car-following model (Wiedemann 99), and  it is assumed  that  all  HDVs  are 
equipped  with  Vehicle  Awareness  Device  (VAD).  VAD  is  an  aftermarket  positioning  and  onboard 
communication unit proposed by the US Department of Transportation’s CVs Initiatives to improve CACC 
systems' performance in low MPR. A VAD-equipped vehicle broadcasts a Basic Safety Message (BSM), 
including its location and speed, so its follower AV can use CACC capability (35).  

According  to    Figure  5,  assuming  a  processing  time  of  0.5  sec  for AVs,  maximum  throughput 
increments of 4%, 10%, and 17% are gained by the SMD model in low market penetration of AVs, which 
are 10%, 20%, and 30% accordingly. The maximum throughput increases as AVs’ MPR increases, and a 
maximum throughput increment of 63% is achieved by the SMD model in a full MPR of AVs. The VISSIM 
built-in platooning module gains slightly more maximum throughput increment than the SMD in higher 
MPR  of AVs. The reason is  that the VISSIM  built-in  module  does  not follow  the  inter-platoon  spacing 
policy, resulting in higher occupancy. 

As  shown in Figure  6, assuming a processing time of 1 sec for the AVs results in  a negligible 
maximum throughput increment in low MPR of AVs, and maximum throughput increments of 23% and 
31% are gained by the SMD and Vissim built-in module accordingly.

As  mentioned  previously,  a  sensitivity  analysis  between  the  maximum  platoon  length  and 
maximum throughput  is  also  performed  for  the  SMD  model.  In this  experiment,  the  maximum  platoon 
length  is  increased  from  4  vehicles  to  12  vehicles  with  an  interval  of  two  vehicles.  According  to  the 
simulation results presented in Figure 7, the maximum throughput slightly increases with platoon length 
increment. For instance, a maximum throughput increment of 3% is gained if the platoon length increases

Travel Time at Merging Section  

As shown in Figure 8, a merging section is modeled in VISSIM. In this scenario, AVs on the main lane are 
in platooning mode, and AVs on the merging lane are controlled by VISSIM built-in car following model 
(Wiedemann 99) before entering the main lane. Merging vehicles will change lanes as soon as enough space 
is  observed on the main lane. This scenario aims to assess the  functionality  of the  SMD model’s  inter-
platoon  spacing  policy  by  comparing  its  performance  with  VISSIM  built-in  model  in  accommodating 
merging  vehicles.  Controlling  the  merging  maneuver  is  not  a  point  of  interest  in  this  study,  and  lane 
changing  maneuver  is  performed  by  VISSIM  software.  Vehicles  from  the  merging  lane  start  platoon-
oriented communication as soon as they enter the main lane to join the existing platoons.  

Figure 8 Merging section scenario 

The maximum speed on the main and merging lanes is 120 km/hr. Traffic volumes on the main lane 
and merging lane are set to 1800 and 600 veh/hr accordingly, and AVs’ processing time is set to 0.5 sec. 
Simulation time is set to 15 minutes, and the resolution is set to 10 steps/sec. The presented results are the 
average of running ten simulations with different random seeds. The travel time’s data collection length is 
280 meters for both merging and main lanes. According to the main-lane travel time results presented in 
Figure  9,  the  SMD  model  gains  24%  and  66%  reductions  assuming  20%  and  100%  MPR  of  AVs 
accordingly. Travel time reductions  gained by the VISSIM built-in module  on the mainlane  are slightly 
higher than the SMD model, specifically in higher MPR of AVs with 12% more travel time reduction than 

 
 
 
 
 
 
14 

the SMD model in full MPR of AVs. The reason is that the Vissim platooning module does not follow any 
inter platoon spacing policy, blocking potential merging vehicles. 

Figure 10, which presents merging lane travel time results, deploying the SMD platooning model 
decreases travel time by 3% in AVs’ MPR of 20%, and a maximum travel time reduction of 36% is gained 
in  full  MPR  of AVs.  However,  the Vissim  built-in  platooning  logic  has  caused  a  noticeable  travel  time 
increment on the merging lane, specifically in higher MPR of AVs. For instance, 10% and 37% travel time 
increment  compared  to  the  none  platooning  circumstances  is  observed  in  40%  and  full  MPR  of AVs 
accordingly.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 

This  paper  presented  an  SMD-based  platooning  logic  for AVs.  Limitations  are  set  on AV’s  maximum 
platooning-oriented  communication  range  to  reflect  real-world  circumstances  into  the  model  and  save 
communication and processing resources. Moreover, to avoid overlengthened platoons, long strings of AVs 
are  divided  into  sub-platoons,  and  the  SMD  model  controls  both  inter-platoon  and  intra-platoon 
interactions. The model is coded into a commercial traffic simulation software, facilitating transportation-
oriented and potential macroscopic or mesoscopic assessments.  

As an initial evaluation, the developed model was compared with VISSIM 2020 built-in platooning 
module. Simulation results revealed that the SMD model produces 75% less positive average spacing error 
than the VISSIM 2020 built-in platooning module in a harsh declaration scenario, which guarantees more 
throughput in unstable driving circumstances. Moreover, no safety threat is detected in any of the models' 
extreme deceleration maneuvers since no negative spacing error is observed.  

Modeling  a  single  lane  highway  section  revealed  that  the  SMD-based  platooning AVs  gain  a 
maximum throughput increment of 63% and 27% in the full and 50% MPR of AVs with a response time of 
0.5 𝑠𝑒𝑐, and a maximum throughput increment of 23% and 17% was achieved in the full and 50% MPR of 
AVs with a response time 1.0 𝑠𝑒𝑐. Assuming a lower MPR of AVs, maximum throughput increments of 4% 
and 10% were gained in 10% and 20% MPR of AVs, with 0.5 sec processing time. A highway merging 
section was modeled with platooning AVs on the main lane, and merging vehicles moving to the main lane 
as soon as enough space was provided for them. In this scenario, travel time reductions of 50% and 67% 
on the main lane were achieved in 60% and 100% MPR of AVs, and noticeable travel time reduction on the 
merging lane was observed if  AVs’ MPR is 80% and higher, and the merging volume is high. Assuming 
AVs’ MPR of 20%, 3%, and 20%, travel time reductions were gained on the merging lane and mainlane 
accordingly.  Considering Vissim  built-in  platooning  logic  as  a  counterpart  for  the  proposed  model,  the 
effectiveness of the proposed model’s inter-platoon spacing policy in accommodating merging vehicles was 
confirmed.  

Potential future studies could include adding a lane change logic to the model, modeling multilane 
highway sections, and finding the optimum  platoon length for  different traffic circumstances. Modeling 
varied AVs types with different characteristics such as mass, response time, and acceleration or deceleration 
rates can also be considered.
