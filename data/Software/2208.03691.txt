The Wigner rotation matrix (d-function), which appears as a part of the angular-momentum-
projection operator, plays a crucial role in modern nuclear-structure models. However, it is a long-
standing problem that its numerical evaluation suﬀers from serious errors and instability, which
hinders precise calculations for nuclear high-spin states. Recently, Tajima [Phys. Rev. C 91, 014320
(2015)] has made a signiﬁcant step toward solving the problem by suggesting the high-precision
Fourier method, which however relies on formula-manipulation softwares. In this paper we propose
an eﬀective and eﬃcient algorithm for the Wigner d function based on the Jacobi polynomials. We
compare our method with the conventional Wigner method and the Tajima Fourier method through
some testing calculations, and demonstrate that our algorithm can always give stable results with
similar high-precision as the Fourier method, and in some cases (for special sets of j, m, k and θ)
ours are even more accurate. Moreover, our method is self-contained and less memory consuming.
A related testing code and subroutines are provided as Supplemental Material in the present paper.

INTRODUCTION

The microscopic description of collective rotational
motion involves quantum-mechanical treatment of angu-
lar momentum, in which the three angular-momentum
operators, ˆji (i = x, y, z), are generators of the Lie alge-
bra of SU(2) and SO(3). The Wigner D-matrix, a uni-
tary matrix in an irreducible representation of the groups
SU(2) and SO(3), enters into the discussion when func-
tions of angular momentum are transformed by the ro-
tation operator ˆR(φ, θ, ψ) = e−iφˆjz e−iθˆjy e−iψˆjz with the
Euler angles (φ, θ, ψ) [1].
If the eigenstates of the an-
gular momentum operators are expressed in the spher-
ical basis and labeled by the quantum number j (with
j = 0, 1
2 , · · · ) and the projection on the z axis
with 2j + 1 quantum numbers labeled as m or k =
−j, −j +1, · · · , j −1, j, the Wigner D-matrix can be writ-
ten as,

As its characteristic feature, dj

oscillation function of θ. In general, the oscillation fre-
quency of the d-function increases rapidly with the an-
gular momentum j. Figure 1 shows the example for
j = 30~.

The Wigner D-function plays crucial roles in many
discussions of modern physics. As a set of orthogonal
functions of the Euler angles, the D-function can be
used to expand other functions. The D-function is re-
lated to some other well-known functions, as for instance,
Dj
00(φ, θ, ψ) =
Pj(cos θ), where Yjm (Pj) is the spherical harmonic func-
tion (Legendre polynomial) [2, 4]. Furthermore, irre-
ducible tensors can be well deﬁned with the help of the

Wigner D-function. Therefore, the Wigner D-function is
indispensable in the study of modern physics, for exam-
ple in nuclear physics [5], quantum metrology [6, 7] and
many other ﬁelds [8, 9]. Especially in theoretical calcu-
lations with the nuclear beyond-mean-ﬁeld methods [10–
16], where angular-momentum projection serves as an
important ingredient, the Wigner D-function is the cern-
tral part of the angular-momentum projector [10, 17–27].
Angular-momentum projected wave functions obtained
in modern nuclear theories are applied to the study of
β-decay [28, 29], neutrinoless double-β decay [30–32], as-
trophysical weak process [33–35], nuclear ﬁssion [36–40],
and many others.

All the above applications require a numerically accu-
rate and computationally stable evaluation of the small
d-function. However, due to the presence of many facto-
rials of large numbers in the formula [2, 41], numerical
calculations of the d-function by the conventional Wigner
method suﬀers from a serious loss of precision at medium
and high spins. Although a few remedies have been pro-
posed [42–44], they still encounters severe numerical in-
stability and/or loss of precision from unclear sources.
A few years ago, Tajima [3] proposed a new method for
the Wigner d-function evaluation based on the Fourier-

d-function is determined by accurate evaluation of the
Fourier coeﬃcients. This method turns out to be of a
signiﬁcant improvement for the numerical stability and
precision in the d-function evaluation. However, those
Fourier coeﬃcients still involve many factorials of large
numbers so that they have to be evaluated with the assis-
tance of a formula-manipulation software. Besides, those
Fourier coeﬃcients take up a lot of memory in the nu-
merical procedure.

In this work, we propose an alternative method based
on the Jacobi polynomials with a stable and high-
precision algorithm for the Wigner d-function evaluation.
We show that our method can achieve a very similar pre-
cision and stable result as the Tajima Fourier method,
but ours may be more eﬃcient and user-friendly. In Sec.
II we provide, step by step, the analytic expressions of
the Wigner, Fourier, and Jacobi methods for the Wigner
d function. The precision of the Jacobi method is an-
alyzed in details and compared with both the Wigner
and Fourier methods in Sec. III and Sec. IV. We ﬁnally
summarize our work in Sec. V.

II. DIFFERENT METHODS FOR THE WIGNER
d-FUNCTION EVALUATION

The conventional method for the d-function is based

on the following Wigner formula [2], i.e.

mk(θ) =

n

It can be seen that the Wigner formula (3) involves a
summation over many terms, W jmk
, with alternating
signs. Each of these terms includes many factorials of
large numbers, especially at medium and high spins, as
they grow exponentially with j (W jmk
n ≈ 2j). Although
cancellation among these terms should ﬁnally lead the
summation to a normal value for the d-function, the pro-
cedure would however cause an accumulation of numer-
ical errors. Thus the numerical results from the Wigner
formula unavoidably suﬀers from a serious loss of preci-
sion at medium and high spins, except for the neighbor-
hood of θ = 0 and π [3].

The problem is the repeated production and cancella-
tion of large numbers. To avoid the problem, Tajima [3]
proposed a new method for the Wigner d-function based
on Fourier-series expansion, in which the d-function can
be expressed as

dj
mk(θ) =

j

Xρ=ρmin

tjmk
ρ

f (ρθ).

(7)

In the above formula, ρmin could be 0, 1/2 or 1 depending
on the values of j, m and k (see Table I of Ref.
[3] for
details) and f is sin (cos) function for m − k being odd
(even). In Eq. (7) the Fourier coeﬃcient reads

The Fourier method avoids cancellation among terms
with large numbers since each Fourier coeﬃcient, tjmk
,
is less than or equal to 1. It has indeed much improved
the calculation of the d-function. However, two factors
may limit its application. On one hand, the Fourier
coeﬃcient, tjmk
, still includes many factorials of large
numbers, i.e., wjmk
, so that it has to be calculated by
means of formula-manipulation software such as MAXIMA

n

ρ

or Mathematica [3]. On the other hand, in practical ap-
plications, one has to read tjmk
from ﬁles and store into
ρ
a memory, which consumes about 70 MB (1.2 GB) space
for the case of j 6 50 (j 6 100) [3]. Recently, Feng et al.
put forward an exact-diagonalization method to calcu-
late the Fourier coeﬃcients, in which the corresponding
precision of the d-function decreases a little and the re-
quested space doubles to be about 2.4 GB for the case of
j 6 100 [41].

It is thus desired to have an eﬃcient algorithm for the
d-function evaluation, which, while keeps the high preci-
sion as of the Tajima Fourier method, is self-contained,
and therefore, user-friendly. Towards this goal, we note
that the Wigner d-function can be expressed in terms of
the Jacobi polynomials [2]

It is important to realize that unlike the Wigner method
and the Fourier method, the expression in Eq. (10) that
leads to the Wigner d-function does not involve a sum-
mation over many terms with large numbers.

III. ERROR ANALYSIS OF THE JACOBI
METHOD

In this and the next sections we carry out error analy-
sis and discuss precision of the Jacobi method in Eq. (10)

3

by comparing with the conventional Wigner method and
the recent Fourier method. In Figs. 2 and 3 the absolute
errors for the d-function from the three diﬀerent meth-
ods are presented, and in Fig. 4 the errors in an integral
calculation involving the d-function are illustrated. All
these results are obtained by a FORTRAN90 testing code
with standard subroutines for the Wigner, Fourier and
Jacobi methods as provided in the Supplemental Mate-
rial [46], where in all cases ﬂoating-point numbers are
adopted as double-precision (64-bit) real number.

First in Fig. 2, we show maximum errors of the dj
mk(θ)
calculation as a function of j, obtained from the Wigner,
Fourier, and Jacobi methods. Results for integer and
half-integer j’s are illustrated separately. Each error of
dj
mk(θ) is evaluated with respect to the exact value cal-
culated from the formula-manipulation software Mathe-
matica 12.1 where higher than 10−25 precision is kept.
The maximum of the errors is recorded by considering all
θ’s from 0◦ to 180◦ with an increment of 5◦, and for all
possible values of m and k with 0 6 m 6 j and k 6 |m|
due to the following symmetries,

mk(θ) = (−1)m−kdj

mk(θ) = (−1)m−kdj

(15f)

It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the maximum error
from the Wigner method increases exponentially with
j, in the way similar as that of W jmk
(3) of
the Wigner formula. Already when j > 25 the error
would exceed 10−10, which may lead to serious numer-
ical problems in applications such as high-spin calcula-
tions in nuclear physics. The origin for loss of precision
in the Wigner method is clear. It is caused by the summa-
tion over many W jmk
terms in Eq. (3), where numerical
errors are accumulated following a power law of j.

in Eq.

n

n

On the contrary, the maximum error from the Fourier
method keeps almost constant in a stable way towards
high spins, with the precision as high as about 10−14 even
when j ≈ 100. Although the Fourier method in Eq. (7)
also involves a summation over many terms, each term
has very high precision since the corresponding Fourier
coeﬃcient tjmk
is calculated by means of the formula-
manipulation software MAXIMA with very high precision
and is stored into a memory [3], so that the accumulation
of numerical errors can be avoided.

ρ

For the Jacobi method, as seen from Eq. (10), there is
no summation over many terms with large numbers and
a high-precision evaluation of the d-function is then ex-
pected. As seen from Fig. 2, when the Jacobi polynomial
is calculated directly by its expression of Eq. (12), a very
similar loss of precision is found for the Jacobi method
as the Wigner formula. This is due to the fact that Eq.

of the Jacobi polynomial in Eqs. (13, 14) are adopted,
the Jacobi method provides a similar high-precision and
stable behavior of the d function as the Fourier method.

This clearly suggests that it is the recurrence relations in
Eqs. (13, 14) that avoid accumulation of numerical er-
rors. Using the recurrence relations to improve numerical
precision may be helpful for many other numerical prob-
lems. Hereafter, the Jacobi method with the recurrence

To further carry out precision analysis in details, we
take the j = 40 case as an example and show in Fig. 3
errors of d40
mk(θ) for diﬀerent values of m, k and θ, with
θ = 30◦, 60◦, 90◦ and 0 6 m 6 j, k 6 |m| due to
the symmetries in Eq. (15). The results of the Jacobi
algorithm (with the recurrence relations) are compared
with those of the Wigner and Fourier methods. It is seen
that the Fourier method gives uniformly a 10−14 ∼ 10−15
precision nearly irrespective of m, k and θ. The Wigner
method, however, leads to a rather unstable precision,
depending sensitively on m, k and θ. The precision from
the Wigner method could have errors as large as ∼ 10−5
when m ∼ k ∼ 0 and θ = 90◦ as seen from Fig. 3(g), or
it could be very accurate, with the precision as high as
10−20 when m ∼ j, k ∼ −j, θ = 30◦ and 60◦ (see Fig.
3(a) and (d)) or m ∼ j, |k| ∼ j, θ = 90◦ (see Fig. 3(g)),
which, for these special cases, is much better than the
Fourier method.

Therefore, In Ref. [3], Tajima suggested that if a very
high precision is needed for the d-function evaluation, one
should develop a program to switch between the Wigner
and Fourier methods with special values of j, m, k and θ.
It is now very interesting to compare the results of the
Jacobi algorithm (with the recurrence relations) in Fig.
3. For each set of j, m, k and θ, the Jacobi algorithm
always reproduces the one with the higher precision be-
tween the Wigner and Fourier methods. This pleasant
feature in the Jacobi algorithm makes it a natural choice
for a switcher as discussed in Ref. [3].

IV. ERROR ANALYSIS WHEN THE WIGNER
d-FUNCTION IS INTEGRATED

According to the Peter–Weyl theorem, the Wigner D-
functions, Dj
mk(φ, θ, ψ), form a complete set of orthog-
onal functions of the Euler angles, and are often used
to expand functions that are related to rotation. As the
Euler angles are continuous variables the expansion takes
the form of integrals with Dj
mk(φ, θ, ψ) being part of the
integrand. Because of the highly oscillatory behavior of
the d-function, as shown in Fig. 1, especially at high j’s,
a high precision in numerical calculations for integrals
involving the d-function becomes an issue.

For discussions,

let us take an example from the
calculation with angular-momentum projection for the
symmetry-violated nuclear wave-functions from mean-
ﬁeld calculations. Assuming axial symmetry for the in-
trinsic states, |Φki, the d-function enters into the calcu-
lation through the angular-momentum projector,

(16)

where ˆR(θ) = e−iθˆjy is the rotation operator around the
y-axis.
It can be generally shown [10] that the calcu-
lated Hamiltonian matrix elements, for example, takes

which is an integral over the Euler angle θ with essentially
two functions in the integrand, dj
kk′ (θ) and the rotated
matrix elements hΦk| ˆH ˆR(θ) |Φk′ i which is expected to
be a smooth function of θ. Due to the highly oscil-
latory behavior of the d-function, its precision may be
more important for integrals involving the d-function as
in many potential applications in nuclear physics, quan-
tum metrology and many other ﬁelds in the future.

In Fig. 4 we take one such integral for discussions and
show the absolute value (error) of the following integral

(18)

calculated by the standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature
formula with diﬀerent number of mesh points Nmesh. The
results of the Jacobi algorithm are compared with those
of the Wigner and Fourier methods. It is seen that the
error from the Wigner method increases rapidly with j
and exceeds 10−8 at j & 35, irrespective of Nmesh, indi-
cating that the error comes mainly from the d-function.
By comparison, the error from the Jacobi algorithm and
Fourier method depends on Nmesh and the precision of
the integral (18) could be as high as 10−16 for j 6 100
if Nmesh = 200 is taken. This suggests that the Jacobi
algorithm for the d-function applied in integration calcu-
lations can achieve a similar high precision as the Fourier
method. The remaining errors in Fig. 4 should then come
mainly from the quadrature formula.

Of course, in numerical calculations and practical ap-
plications much more complicated integrands generally
appear in integrals, for which a large Nmesh is expected,
and causes heavier computational burden. Nevertheless,
the results in Fig. 4(b) and (c) suggest that one has a
choice to use smaller numbers of mesh points if states of
only lower angular momenta are studied.

ingredients for many nuclear-structure models and are
important for nuclear physics, quantum metrology and

FIG. 4. (Color online) The common logarithm of the maximum error in the numerical value of the integral I j
mk in Eq. (18) by
the Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula as a function of j. Cases with diﬀerent number of mesh points Nmesh by the Jacobi
algorithm are compared with those of the Wigner and Fourier methods. The maximum error is taken over all the possible
values of m and k for each j. See the text for details.

formula-manipulation softwares and does not need a large
memory. With the help from the recurrence relations
of the Jacobi polynomial, the Jacobi algorithm always
gives the best precision so far irrespective of the values
of j, m, k and θ. Furthermore, it is self-contained, and
therefore, user-friendly.

The Jacobi algorithm could be the most eﬀective al-
gorithm for the Wigner d-function evaluation in nuclear
physics, quantum metrology, and many other ﬁelds in the
future. The related FORTRAN90 testing code and subrou-
tines for the Wigner and Fourier methods as well as the
Jacobi algorithm are provided as a Supplemental Mate-
rial of the present article.
