Abstract:  COVID-19  has  had  a  profound  impact  on  the  lives  of  all  human  beings.  Emerging 

technologies have made significant contributions to the fight against the pandemic. An extensive 

review  of  the  application  of  technology  will  help  facilitate  future  research  and  technology 

development to provide better solutions for future pandemics. In contrast to the extensive surveys 

of academic communities that have already been conducted, this study explores the IT community 

of practice. Using GitHub as the study target, we analyzed the main functionalities of the projects 

submitted during the pandemic. This study examines trends in projects with different functionalities 

and the relationship between functionalities and technologies. The study results show an imbalance 

in the number of projects with varying functionalities in the GitHub community, i.e., applications 

account for more than half of the projects. In contrast, other data analysis and AI projects account 

for a smaller share. This differs significantly from the survey of the academic community, where 

the findings focus more on cutting-edge technologies while projects in the community of practice 

use more mature technologies. The spontaneous behavior of developers may lack organization and 

make it challenging to target needs.(cid:1)

Since discovering the COVID-19 outbreak in late 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly across the 

globe.  Modern  technologies  have  made  essential  contributions  to  the  pandemic.  Artificial 

intelligence,  the  Internet  of  Things,  and  big  data  have  contributed  to  epidemic  prevention  and 

control. These technologies are being used for disease diagnosis, contact tracing, surveillance, and 

social power to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and better treat patients (Jakhar and 

Kaur 2020). 

Reviewing the application of artificial intelligence, big data, and other technologies in pandemics 

will  help  facilitate  future  research  and  technology  development  to  provide  better  solutions  for 

dealing with COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics (He, Zhang, and Li 2021). A survey of the 

literature through published academic papers (e.g., Karami et al. 2021; Vaishya et al. 2021), patents 

(e.g., Keestra et al. 2022), and news (Zhao et al. 2021) is a common way to review the application 

of  technologies  in  the  pandemic.  Unlike  previous  studies,  the  present  study  aims  to  review  the 

application  of  new  technologies  in  the  pandemiby  investigation  communities  of  practice. 

Communities of practice have an active role in knowledge sharing and serve as a bridge between 

knowledge and technology (Adams and Freeman 2000). GitHub is the world's largest open-source 

project  hosting  site.  It  is  an  essential  community  of  practice  for  modern  technologies  such  as 

artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data. In recent issues of the Mining Software 

Repositories  (MSR)  conference,  many  studies  have  been  analyzed  based  on  GitHub  repositories 

(Pickerill 2020). As can be seen, the analysis of GitHub repositories is highly representative and 

therefore is the subject of this paper. 

This study will discuss the application of technologies in the Github community to fight against 

the pandemic from two perspectives. On the one hand, is the functionality and type of COVID-19-

related  projects.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  the  association  between  different  technologies  and 

functionalities. Topics2 are hashtags the project developer adds to classify the repository, including 

the intended purpose, subject area, community, or programming language. Observing the trend of 

hashtags may realize the events in the community or people focus on what topics(Chen and Kao 

2015).  We  collected  the  information  on  COVID-19-related  projects  on  GitHub.  Since  some 

developers did not label hashtags, we trained a multi-label classification model using the projects 

with hashtags and extracted hashtags for the projects lacking hashtags. We did co-word clustering, 

word  frequency  statistics,  and  association  rules  mining  for  the  hashtags  to  achieve  our  research 

objectives. To better illustrate the research goals of this paper, Figure 1 shows a project with a higher 

star rating. The descriptions in "About" and "Readme" show that this project provides COVID-19 

case data API. The hashtags in "About" reflect the primary purpose (API) of the project and the 

technology (Redis) used in the project. 

The main contributions of this paper include the following. Analyzing the response of specific 

communities of practice to the pandemic will help facilitate better solutions for the community of 

practice  in  response  to  the  COVID-19  and  future  pandemics.  Summarizing  the  functionality  of 

projects initiated by the IT community of practice during the pandemic and the technologies used 

will help create a larger pool of pre-existing technologies to address future crises. An examination 

of  GitHub  shows  the  differences  in  technology  adoption  during  the  pandemic  between  the 

communities  of  practice  and  the  academic  community.  This  can  provide  helpful  insight  into  the 

rapid adoption of emerging technologies during the pandemic.(cid:1)

In this section, we review two aspects of the pandemic. We first check the impact of COVID-19 on 

society in general and then highlight the importance of technology in the context of a pandemic. We 

then review relevant studies that have examined the application of technology during the pandemics. 

2.1  Overview of pandemic impact 

The pandemic has profoundly impacted the global economy, industrial production, and lifestyles. 

Assessing  this  impact  and  identifying  possible  challenges  is  essential  for  discovering  possible 

mechanisms to address these issues. Numerous studies have examined the effects of pandemics on 

different aspects of social life. 

By mining and analyzing policy texts and social media data, combined with interviews and other 

methods, the researchers tried to reveal the pandemic's impacts on social life deeply. Researchers 

try  to  analyze  the  effect  of  the  pandemic  on  the  global  economy  and  seek  solutions  to  the  crisis 

(Song  and  Zhou  2020).  The  pandemic  can  bring  terrible  disruptions  to  financial  markets,  and 

measuring  the  predictability  of  market  fears  is  vital  to  stabilizing  financial  markets  (Ghosh  and 

Sanyal 2021). The pandemic has forced companies to adjust their strategies and goals (Yadav, Kar, 

and  Kashiramka  2021),  creating  much  uncertainty  for  employment  (Koch,  Plattfaut,  and  Kregel 

2021). The pandemic limited travel and made people's work and study quickly shift online, changing 

the way people live (Chakraborty and Kar 2021). 

The impact of COVID-19 on the global economy is undoubtedly devastating. But in this crisis, 

there are both opportunities and challenges. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of emerging 

technologies, which contributed to saving lives and improving health during the pandemic (Brem, 

Viardot,  and  Nylund  2021).  Big  data  technologies  help  us  predict  and  control  the  spread  of 

pandemics (e.g., Srinivasa Rao & Vazquez, 2020). Artificial intelligence technology can achieve 

rapid patient diagnosis and new drug discovery (e.g., Apostolopoulos & Mpesiana, 2020; Randhawa 

et  al.,  2020).  Emerging  technologies  are  critical  for  us  to  beat  the  pandemic,  and  open-source 

projects guarantee the rapid adoption of these emerging technologies. 

(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:5)  Investigation of technology application during the pandemic(cid:1)

Innovations and technology applications have provided new solutions to many challenges during 

the pandemic. Many researchers have examined technological innovations and applications during 

the  pandemic.  Most  reviews  of  technology  applications  during  the  pandemic  have  examined 

numerous  technologies  during  the  pandemic  through  a  survey  of  academic  literature,  including 

Industry  4.0  technologies  (Javaid  et  al.  2020),  digital  technologies  (Wang  et  al.  2021),  artificial 

intelligence, cloud computing (Alharbi and Abdur Rahman 2021), etc. Data for the survey of the 

academic literature were primarily obtained from numerous literature databases, including Scopus, 

Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Research Gate (e.g., Javaid et al. 2020; Vaishya et al. 2021). In 

addition to the academic literature review, some studies have also reviewed technology applications 

during the pandemic by examining patents (e.g., Solanki et al. 2021; Alshrari et al. 2022). A few 

studies have examined the use of technology during the pandemic by reviewing news (e.g., Zhao et 

al. 2021). 

Academic literature and patents are the most direct results of scientific research and reflect the 

innovation and application of technologies during the pandemic. But there is also a need to transfer 

knowledge  from  scientific  and  technological  achievements  to  production  applications,  which 

requires sharing technology, skills, and knowledge from one institution to another (de Wit-de Vries 

et  al.  2019).  As  an  essential  tool  for  knowledge  sharing  and  organizational  learning  (Marsick, 

Shiotani, and Gephart 2014), communities of practice serve as a bridge between technology and 

knowledge. As one of the world's largest IT communities of practice, GitHub launched many open-

source projects during the pandemic. These open-source projects share code and allow community 

members to create and build together. Open strategies can yield higher returns (Barge-Gil 2013), 

while  modern  software  implementations  rely  entirely  on  open-source  libraries  and  components 

(Shrestha  et  al.  2020).  Community  plays  a  unique  role  in  creating  new  things  (Soos  and  Leazer 

2020);  it  can  be  seen  that  the  open-source  community  is  the  leading  practice  frontier  of  open 

innovation. Open-source projects provided many open-source libraries and components for the rapid 

adoption  of  technologies  during  the  pandemic.  Learn  how  the  pandemic  "mobilized"  specific 

communities  of  practice  by  reviewing  the  functionality  of  projects  started  by  the  open-source 

community during the pandemic and the technologies used. This will help the community of practice 

provide better solutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.

To  discover  the  functionality  of  pandemic-related  projects  in  the  Github  community  and  apply 

different technologies, this study uses the Readme and Topics of open-source projects as the data 

source for analysis. This study first explores the main types of projects through cluster analysis, 

explores the association between functionality and related technologies through correlation analysis, 

and analyzes the evolution of open-source projects in the GitHub community during the pandemic. 

The  specific  methods  of  this  study  mainly  include  five  steps:  data  collection,  data  cleaning  and 

preprocessing,  synonym  hashtags  preprocessing,  hashtags  extraction,  and  data  analysis.  The 

research method is shown in Figure 2.

3.1  Data Collection 

 
 
GitHub has a large number of low-quality projects that are not managed. These projects cannot be 

analyzed  in  this  study.  The  community’s  response  to  the  project  is  an  appropriate  standard  to 

measure the quality of the project. Therefore, this study uses the number of project stars to measure 

the project quality and limits the number of project stars to be greater than 0. Since the name in the 

early stage of the epidemic is not clear, we used "2019-ncov", "coronavirus," and "COVID-19" as 

the  search  terms  to  ensure  good  recall.  Limit  the  project  creation  time  to  August  31,  2020,  and 

retrieve it with GitHub's search API3. Use the crawler tool to collect the retrieved item data. The 

data collection time is September 23, 2020, and we ordered 16,706 data. 

3.2  Data cleaning and pre-processing 

This section mainly introduces data cleaning and pre-processing. The functionality of the project 

and the technology used are hidden in the title, Readme, and hashtag. The title and Readme text 

were merged into a project introduction to facilitate analysis. Due to the lack of project introduction 

in  some  projects,  it  is  difficult  for  other  developers  to  understand  the  specific  purpose  and 

functionality of the project. This kind of project was not taken as our analysis object, so we screened 

out 15541 projects whose title and Readme are not empty and whose stars are more significant than 

0.  The  developers  in  GitHub  come  from  worldwide,  so  the  title  and  Readme  of  the  project  also 

contain multiple languages4.    We used Baidu translation API5 to translate all non-English project 

introductions  into  English  to  conduct  a  unified  analysis.  The  translated  project  introduction  was 

sorted  in  descending  order  according  to  the  number  of  characters,  and  the  distribution  chart  of 

project introduction length, as shown in Figure 3, was obtained.

Figure 3. Sorting of the length of the project introduction. 

As shown in Figure 3, the length of the project introduction follows the power-law distribution. 

Because some project introductions are too short to clearly describe the project purpose and other 

information, these projects need to be removed. Through manual screening, it was found that the 

introduction  was  more  complete  when  the  introduction  length  was  more  significant  than  200. 

Therefore, this study excluded projects with introduction lengths below 200. After screening, a total 

of 12,199 items were retained. For the remaining tasks, we remove the stop words6 and other special 

characters  from  the  introduction  (i.e.,  only  English  and  numbers  are  kept).  The  data  processing 

results are shown in Table 1.

3.3  Synonym hashtags processing 

Since the project Topics are labeled by different project developers, there is no uniform standard. 

There will be many synonymous hashtags, which need to replace the synonymous hashtags with a 

 
unified hashtag. Synonymous hashtags mainly include the following four situations: 

i. 

Different  forms  of  the  same  root  word,  such  as  “healthy”  and  “health,”  “chatbots,”  and 

“chatbot”. 

ii. 

Spelling errors, such as “anroid” and “android.” 

iii. 

Hyphens exist in the same hashtags, such as "machine learning" and "machine-learning", 

"Android application," and "Android-application". 

iv. 

Synonymous 

tags,  such  as  "COVID-19",  "novel-coronavirus-2019",  and  "novel-

coronavirus,” express the same meaning. 

Given the above four situations, the present study found synonymous hashtags by calculating the 

semantic similarity and editing distance (Marzal and Vidal 1993) of hashtags and combining them 

with manual filtering. With the help of the gensim7, the Word2Vec is used to train the word vectors 

with  a  corpus  of  the  introduction  of  all  projects  (Mikolov  et  al.  2013).  For  each  hashtag  in  the 

existing  topic  collection,  the  ten  tags  that  are  most  semantically  similar  to  the  hashtag  and  the 

hashtags less than one-fifth of the word length away from the edit of that hashtag are selected. The 

similar hashtags automatically screened out are manually screened to find synonymous  hashtags 

and  build  a  synonym  dictionary.  The  number  of  synonymous  hashtags  in  different  situations  is 

shown in Table 2.

3.4  Hashtag extraction     

One of the main objectives of this study is to analyze the purpose and functionality of the project. 

We will explore and analyze the intended purpose, the functionality, and the programming language 

with the help of the project hashtags. In the filtered data of this article, 3840 projects have been 

tagged  by  developers,  and  the  remaining  8359  items  were  not.  Therefore,  this  study  will  train 

classification models using labeled data and automatically assign tags to unlabeled data. 

There are a large number of low-frequency hashtags.    This study selected the core hashtags from 

the existing collection as candidate hashtags for analysis to reduce the interference of low-frequency 

words and facilitate visualization. The current hashtags were sorted in descending order of word 

frequency. As shown in Figure 4, the word frequency ranking of these hashtags presents a power-

law distribution. Formula (1) is the calculation formula of cumulative word frequency proportion. 

The Ci is the word frequency of the ith tag with the highest word frequency. The P is greater than 

or equal to 50%, and the top k hashtags in descending order of word frequency were selected as the 

core hashtags.

In this paper, we used TfidfVectorizer in sklearn9 to vectorize the text. This method takes TF-

IDF(Salton  and  Buckley  1988)  as  feature  weight.  The  present  study  used  chi-square  to  select 

features. We tried the commonly used supervised learning models, including SVM(Chang and Lin 

2011),  NB  (Manning  et  al.  2008),  KNN  (Keller,  Gray,  and  Givens  1985),  Logistic  regression 

(Hosmer et al. 2013), and Random Forest (Breiman 2001). The best model from the above models 

was selected to predict the data with missing hashtags.

3.5  The functionality identification and technology application analytics 

This  section  mainly  introduces  the  method  and  process  of  co-word  clustering  analysis,  word 

frequency  statistical  analysis,  and  association  rule  mining  for  hashtags  to  analyze  the  project 

purpose, functionality, and related technology application. 

3.5.1. Co-word clustering analysis 

The  project  hashtags  contain  the  expected  purpose  and  functionality  of  the  project,  and  the  co-

occurrence  of  different  hashtags  can  reflect  the  relevance  between  the  project  purpose  and 

functionality.  Therefore,  the  co-word  cluster  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  project  hashtags  to 

understand the primary goals and functionality of the epidemic-related open-source projects. The 

basic idea of spectral clustering comes from the spectral graph partition theory. Spectral clustering 

transforms the clustering problem into a graph partitioning problem. The partitioning into subgraphs 

has  the  maximum  similarity  within  the  subgraphs  and  the  minimum  similarity  between  the 

subgraphs  (Jianbo  Shi  and  Malik  2000).  A  co-occurrence  matrix  is  created  based  on  the  co-

 
occurrence of the labels, and the co-word matrix is converted into an affinity matrix using Ochiia 

coefficients. The affinity matrix was spectrally clustered using the sklearn10, and the optimal number 

of clusters was judged using the Calinski Harabaz (1974) criterion. The more significant the Calinski 

Harabaz,  the  better  the  clustering  effect.  Input  the  clustering  results  into  vosViewer11  for 

visualization and analyze open-source projects' primary purposes and functionality. 

3.5.2. Trend analysis of open-source projects 

To explore the functionality of open-source projects in the GitHub community during the pandemic 

and the problems they aim to solve, and how different types of projects have changed over time. In 

this  paper,  we  do  a  descriptive  statistical  analysis  of  the  average  word  frequency  of  hashtags  in 

projects with other purposes. Formula (2) is the calculation formula of intermediate word frequency. 

Ci  is  the  word  frequency  of  the  ith  hashtag  in  cluster  C,  and  N  is  this  cluster’s  total  number  of 

hashtags.

3.5.3. Association rules mining 

To  explore  the  usage  of  related  technologies  in  different  projects,  this  article  used  association 

analysis to mine the association rules hidden between hashtags. Apriori is a widely used association 

rule  mining  algorithm  proposed  by  R.  Agrawal  and  r.  Srikant(1994).  We  used  Apriori  to  mine 

association rules. Based on the specific tasks of this paper, support, confidence, and lift are explained 

as follows. The support of hashtag set A is the probability that all hashtags in set A co-occur in the 

hashtag  set  D.  The  confidence  of  association  rule  A->B  is  the  possibility  that  hashtag  put  B  is 

conditional on the occurrence of hashtag set A. The lift of association rule A->B is the confidence 

of association rule A->B divided by the support of B. The formulas of support, confidence, and lift 

are (3) (4) (5).

A rule with support and confidence greater than the threshold is a strong association rule. Lift is 

a reflection of whether the association rule is valuable or not. If it is greater than 1, the association 

rule is useful, and the greater the lift is, the better the association rule is. The association between 

project  functionality  and  related  technologies  between  technologies  and  technologies  is  further 

analyzed by mining the association in project hashtags.

This section introduces the purpose and functionality of COVID-19 related projects, the evolution 

trend  of  open-source  projects  on  GitHub,  and  the  correlation  between  functionalities  and 

technologies. 

4.1  Experiment results of hashtags extraction 

The task in this article is a multi-label classification task. The multi-label classification task mainly 

contains two types of evaluation, i.e., label-based and sample-based (Zhang and Zhou 2014). In this 

paper, the sample-based is chosen as the evaluation metric. The present study used macro precision 

(P), macro recall (R), and macro F1 to evaluate the model. For a project with missing hashtags, if 

the number of correctly predicted hashtags is TP, the number of incorrectly predicted hashtags is FP, 

and the number of unpredicted hashtags is FN. The formulae for the model evaluation metrics are 

shown in (6), (7), and (8).

Table 3. Model performance of hashtags extraction. 

It can be seen from Table 3 that NB and SVM can perform better in this task. Since SVM had a 

higher accuracy rate, we chose SVM to extract hashtags. The top ten projects marked with stars in 

the classification results are given in Table 4. The URL is the project link, and Hashtags are the 

classification results. Checking the corresponding items shows that the selected hashtags can more 

accurately reflect the project’s content.

4.2  The purposes and functionalities of COVID-19 related projects on Github 

According to the co-occurrence of hashtags, the results of hashtag extraction were clustered. When 

the number of clusters was equal to 4, the Calinski and Harabasz score was highest. Therefore, the 

cluster  number  was  determined  as  4.  The  clustering  results  were  imported  into  vosViewer  for 

visualization display, and the clustering results are shown in Figure 5. According to the clustering 

in  Figure  5,  different  colors  represent  different  clusters.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  purposes  and 

functionalities of COVID-19 related open-source projects on GitHub mainly include the following 

four contents: 

i. 

Application  of  AI.  In  the  blue  part  of  Figure  5,  the  functionalities  of  the  projects  in  this 

category  mainly  include  the  application  of  AI  in  the  pandemic.  Some  projects  use  deep 

learning,  machine  learning  (machine  learning,  deep  learning),  and  other  technologies  to 

assist  the  diagnosis  of  patients  with  clinical  data.  Some  projects  use  computer  vision 

technology for mouthpiece detection, control of social distance, etc. In addition, some of the 

projects provide information sharing portals for drug discovery, the use of machine learning 

methods to identify potential drugs, etc. 

ii. 

Application  of  data  science.  In  the  green  section  of  Figure  4,  the  functionalities  of  this 

category  are  focused  on  the  various  stages  of  the  data  science  lifecycle.  It  includes  data 

collection,  storage,  modeling,  analysis,  and  data  visualization.  Data  collection  mainly 

consists  of  some  web  page-grabbing  tools.  Data  storage  related  projects  include  open 

repositories  directly  providing  relevant  data,  and  some  projects  provide  data  API.  Data 

modeling  related  projects  mainly  focus  on  pandemic  development  data  combined  with 

infectious disease models to predict pandemic trends. Data analysis and data visualization 

related projects mainly focus on statistical analysis and visualization of pandemic data. 

iii.  Web applications. In the red part of Figure 4, this kind of project is mainly used to track the 

pandemic  situation,  providing  various  forms  and  real-time  data  and  its  visual  web 

application  (web  app).  Some  projects  implement  relevant  functions  from  worldwide  data 

monitoring  to  the  distribution  of  pandemic  data  in  small  communities.  In  addition  to 

providing  data  tracking  and  presentation,  some  web  application  projects  also  include 

information  collection  and  communication  features.  Examples  include  the  collection  of 

patient symptoms and a centralized communication platform for medical staff and volunteers. 

iv.  Mobile  applications.  In  the  yellow  part  of  Figure  4,  these  projects  mainly  provide  some 

mobile applications. Some of the mobile application projects have similar functionality to 

web applications in that they track and visualize real-time dynamic information about the 

pandemic (coronavirus tracking). The most popular assignments in this category implement 

proximity tracking and exposure notification. The primary function of these projects is to 

use the Bluetooth of mobile devices to record exposure information and thus notify the user 

of any contact with the patient. 

In summary, the GitHub community of practice projects that started during the pandemic wanted 

to  address  the  following  three  main  areas:  web  and  mobile  app-based  data  information  services, 

applications around all phases of the data science lifecycle, and the application of AI.

4.3  Trends of COVID-19 related projects 

The average word frequency share of hashtags in the above four categories of functionalities was 

counted, and the results are shown in Figure 6. As seen in Figure 6, the most significant number of 

COVID-19-related projects are apps. Apps include mobile apps and web apps, which account for 

more than 50%. Projects for data science and AI applications account for 30% and 18%.

Figure 6. Average word frequency of hashtags for different functionalities. 

The average word frequency of the hashtags in the four categories was counted by month, and 

the results are shown in Figure 7. An interesting conclusion can be drawn from the figure, i.e., the 

projects in the three different functionalities have essentially the same trend of change except for 

mobile  applications.  Mobile  applications  show  another  direction,  probably  related  to  contact 

tracking applications. In April, the focus on mobile applications peaked when Google and Apple 

announced reliable support for this type of program on their operating systems. The trend of change 

is the same for all kinds of projects and may be related to the skills possessed by developers within 

the platform. Most developers have only partial skills. For example, mobile application developers 

tend  to  focus  only  on  mobile  application  development  and  have  no  other  skills.  The  skill 

composition of developers within the community of practice is relatively stable. Since the number 

 
 
 
 
of developers with each skillset is regular, the trend of change in projects across functional types is 

also  steady.  Understandably,  data  science-related  applications  reached  a  high  peak  earlier.  Both 

applications and AI applications need to be built on a data foundation. Only after the initial data 

collection and storage are completed can a range of applications such as data information services 

be performed. 

Figure 7. Trends in hashtag frequency evolution of projects for different functionalities. 

4.4  Association rules between functionalities and technologies 

The minimum support and minimum confidence were set to 0.002 and 0.2. To reduce the complexity, 

only the frequent binomial set was extracted. Data science and AI application projects are highly 

correlated, so association rules are removed for the hashtags of data science and AI projects. The 

network diagram is drawn based on the obtained association rules with a lift greater than 1. 

 
Figure 8. Association rules network of data science and AI application projects in GitHub. 

Figure 8 shows the association rules between hashtags in data science and AI-related applications. 

The blue part in the figure is the hashtags for AI-related projects, and the green part is the hashtags 

for data science related projects. Each node in the graph represents a hashtag. The larger the node, 

the higher the word frequency. The connection between nodes means that there are association rules 

between them. The thickness of the link reflects the lift of the association rule. The thicker the link, 

the  higher  the  lift  degree.  Whether  it  is  a  data  science  application  or  an  AI-related  application, 

Python  is  the  core  programming  language  that  deserves  to  be  used  in  such  applications.  The 

technologies associated with it include various python libraries and frameworks. The R language 

also has a place in this category, but its use is mainly limited to data analysis. As shown in Figure 8, 

the  pandemic-related  data  (covid19  data)  focuses  on  openness  (open  data),  and  the  data  storage 

formats are mainly CSV and JSON. At the same time, these data focus on the timeliness of epidemic 

tracking  (Coronavirus  real  time).  In  applying  artificial  intelligence,  deep  learning  and  machine 

 
learning are the core technologies in AI-related projects. In applications related to computer vision, 

convolutional  neural  networks  (CNN)  are  closely  associated  with  it.  TensorFlow  is  the  most 

commonly used framework for AI-related projects on GitHub, and Pytorch is also used, but less so 

than TensorFlow. This is different from the academic community, where Pytorh has been used more 

often in the last two years13. This is a reflection of the differences between the academic and practice 

communities. 

Figure 9. Application projects' hashtags association rules network in GitHub about COVID-19. 

Figure 9 shows the association rules between hashtags in the application project, where red is the 

hashtag of the web application and yellow is the hashtag of the mobile application. This kind of 

project occupies an important position in the COVID-19 related projects of GitHub. From Figure 9, 

we can determine the mainstream programming languages and frameworks used by developers in 

the  community  of  practice  for  Android  and  IOS  development  today.  Android  developers  in  the 

community of practice mostly use Java, dart, and Kotlin as programming languages. Swift is the 

only  programming  language  highly  related  to  IOS  development.  The  technology  related  to  web 

 
applications shown in Figure 9 is mainly front-end technology. As you can see, the react framework 

occupies an essential position in front-end technology, and some JavaScript libraries can also be 

found widely used on GitHub.

This study reviews the functionalities of COVID-19-related projects in the IT community of practice 

in  the  pandemic  and  the  associations  between  functionalities  and  technologies.  This  section  will 

discuss three aspects of IT applications during the pandemic, the association between functionalities 

and technologies and implications for practice. 

5.1  The application of technology in communities of practice during the pandemic 

Our findings suggest that projects submitted in the GitHub community during the pandemic were 

mainly related to data information services, outbreak trend prediction, and diagnostic treatment of 

the outbreak. The public needs to be informed of the current outbreak transmission status in the 

pandemic and access and communicate information. Infectious disease scientists need outbreak data 

to make predictions about the spread and development of an outbreak. Biomedical researchers need 

patient data to find ways to diagnose and treat patients. An essential foundation for achieving these 

needs is data, including outbreak statistics (statistical information on confirmed diagnoses, deaths, 

and cures), patient clinical data, etc. However, the performance of the emerging technology is not 

yet stable due to insufficient COVID-19 data sets, non-uniform data formats, missing data, and noise 

(Mbunge	et	al.	2021). As you can see, data is an important foundation for technology applications 

during the pandemic. Looking at the projects submitted on GitHub, there was a rapid increase in 

data science related projects at the beginning of the pandemic. This phenomenon reflects the quick 

response of the community to the pandemic. 

The evolution of the different projects on GitHub shows that the various functional open-source 

projects have the same evolutionary trends. This may reflect the skill composition of the people in 

the community of practice. The submission of projects in the community is partly demand-driven 

of  the  pandemic  but  more  likely  related  to  the  developers’  skills  in  the  community.  At  the  time 

developers  join  the  community,  they  possess  specific  skills.  This  makes  them  prefer  or  only 

implement certain applications. In a community of practice, these preferences and tendencies will 

influence community members (developers) to create and absorb new knowledge (Roberts, 2006). 

Communities  of  practice  are  groups  of  people  who  share  expertise  and  are  passionate  about  a 

common cause, connected informally (Wenger & Snyder, 2000). Developers develop and upload 

related projects spontaneously, and this spontaneous lack of organized development activity may 

not meet actual demand quickly enough. 

5.2  Association between functionalities and technologies 

This study explores the correlation between project functionalities and technologies through open-

source project hashtags correlation analysis. It provides a macro perspective on the current state of 

adoption of new technologies in the GitHub community of practice. The GitHub community has the 

highest percentage of apps in its pandemic-related projects. The main programming languages used 

in developing these applications include Java, Dart, Flutter, JavaScript, etc. These technologies are 

widely  accepted  and  used  in  the  community  of  practice,  and  there  are  many  developers  in  the 

community who have mastered the skill. These technologies have a high impact and a high level of 

technology maturity. Other vital projects in the community are related applications based on data 

science and artificial intelligence. The technologies involved in these projects mainly include data 

modeling,  predictive  analytics,  machine  learning,  and  deep  learning.  Artificial  intelligence 

applications occupy the smallest share of the community. The application of artificial intelligence 

provides some innovative solutions to combat the pandemic, and this type of technology is more 

cutting-edge and an important direction for innovation. 

The  survey  of  the  community  of  practice  obtained  different  results  than  the  survey  of  the 

academic literature. A review of the use of modern technology in the pandemic through the academic 

literature reveals more discussion of cutting-edge technologies. These technologies mainly include 

artificial intelligence (AI), telemedicine, blockchain, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), etc. (e.g., Alharbi 

& Abdur Rahman, 2021; Mbunge et al., 2021; Vaishya et al., 2021). And a survey of the community 

of  practice  revealed  that  more  projects  launched  during  the  pandemic  were  applications.  These 

programs  are  more  likely  to  provide  data  information  services,  and  the  technology  used  is  more 

mature. 

(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:4)  Implications for practice(cid:1)

All the findings show that emerging technologies are widely used in the pandemic. The pandemic 

has  received  widespread  attention  from  developers  in  the  IT  community  of  practice.  Data  is  the 

cornerstone of the rapid application of emerging technologies. In the early stages of a pandemic, the 

first thing that relevant developers and scientists need to accomplish should be collecting, storing, 

and sharing various types of pandemic data. In addition, in the big data environment, we should 

consider transforming open data into open link data and analyzing the information, conducive to the 

rapid  development  and  use  of  applications  (Victorino  et  al.  2018).  During  the  pandemic,  the 

application of technology in the community of practice differs significantly from the application in 

the academic community. Researchers and developers from different disciplines should collaborate 

more,  which  will  help  knowledge  transfer  and  facilitate  the  application  of  emerging  technology 

(Teixeira et al., 2019). 

The current GitHub community of developers submitting open-source projects is more likely to 

be a spontaneous act. Communities of practice should provide relevant services in future crises and 

organize community members to contribute their skills efficiently. Improving the quality of open-

source projects in a pandemic requires organizational management by the community. In the late 

stages of the pandemic, communities of practice such as GitHub should organize pandemic-related 

projects  more  effectively  to  provide  a  large  pool  of  pre-existing  technologies  for  responding  to 

possible  future  crises.  For  example,  use  hierarchical  tags  to  manage  related  projects.  The

The  research  in  this  paper  has  some  shortcomings.  On  the  one  hand,  only  relevant  projects  on 

GitHub  are  explored  and  analyzed.  To  understand  the  status  of  open-source  projects  during  the 

pandemic, more open source communities may need to be mined and analyzed. On the other hand, 

it is difficult to understand the true intent of developers through the econometric analysis of projects 

submitted by developers. Future work may require questionnaires or interview methods to collect 

data to get a clearer picture of developer intent. In addition, future work could analyze maps of the 

community  from  multiple  perspectives  and  provide  a  more  fine-grained  analysis  of  the  use  of 

technology. Also, we can consider the study of the collaboration between project development teams 

and explore the collaboration perspective between developers and scientists.
