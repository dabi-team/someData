ABSTRACT

Interferometric techniques such as aperture masking have the potential to enhance spatial resolution capabilities
when imaging moderate-contrast sources with small angular size, such as close-in exoplanets and circumstellar
disks around distant young stars. The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy
(SCALES) instrument, currently under development, is a lenslet integral ﬁeld spectrograph that will enable the
W. M. Keck Observatory to carry out high-contrast direct imaging of exoplanets between 2 and 5 microns. We
explore the potential beneﬁt of aperture masking to SCALES by testing the contrast achievable by several mask
designs. The scalessim software package was used to simulate observations at wavelength bins in the M, L, and
K bands, with optical path diﬀerence (OPD) maps used to simulate realistic Keck adaptive optics performance.
Noise from astrophysical and instrumental sources was also applied to simulated signals. Mask designs were
assessed based on depth of the generated contrast curves.

1. INTRODUCTION

The technique of high-contrast direct imaging enables the study and characterization of proto-planetary disks1, 2
and relatively young, hot planets that are at large angular separations from their stars. It can provide spectro-
scopic data on systems that are inaccessible to study via the transit or radial velocity methods, i.e. systems that
do not transit or that have very wide angular separations.3 A number of new exoplanets have been discovered
and studied with this method,4, 5 and it has also allowed inferences to be made about the overall exoplanet pop-
ulation.6 The next generation of direct imaging instrumentation is expected to push detection limits and study
a wider and more diverse population of planets, and will expand spectroscopic characterization capabilities.

SCALES, which stands for Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy, is an
upcoming integral ﬁeld spectrograph (IFS) that will operate from 2.0µm to 5.2µm and is expected to see ﬁrst
light at the W. M. Keck Observatory in 20257 (also see Ref. 8 in these Proceedings). As the ﬁrst facility-class
IFS that will operate at wavelengths longer than 2.5µm, SCALES will expand the currently accessible population
of directly imaged planets to cooler and lower-mass planets. The high contrast between planet and host star is a
major challenge for direct imaging; SCALES reduces this issue somewhat by operating in the thermal infrared,
a wavelength regime where planet-star contrast is less extreme and where planets and disks are relatively bright.
SCALES improves upon the design of the Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (ALES) instrument,
which is housed at the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI), and which provided the ﬁrst spatially
resolved spectra of substellar companions in the thermal infrared.9

Non-redundant aperture masking (NRM) is a technique that is relatively cheap and simple to implement and
that can signiﬁcantly increase spatial resolution at moderate contrast (5-8 magnitudes at λ/D, depending on the
image quality of the individual setup), surpassing the diﬀraction limit.10–13 It consists of converting a telescope
aperture into an interferometer by covering the aperture by an opaque mask with holes cut out. Typically this
masking is done with a small mask in the instrumental pupil plane, often in a ﬁlter wheel. In a non-redundant
mask, each pair of holes contributes uniquely to the Fourier transform of the fringes produced in the image plane,

with no two baselines having the same length and angular position. In this work, we assess the performance
of three diﬀerent non-redundant aperture masks on SCALES. We utilize the Python-based scalessim software
package∗ to simulate SCALES observations using each mask. We then produce closure phases and squared
visibilities and use the SAMpy package14 † to generate contrast curves.

Figure 1. The three non-redundant sparse aperture mask designs used in this work. The mask holes are shown projected
onto the 10m Keck primary mirror and measure 1m in diameter. From left to right: the 6-hole mask modiﬁed from the
LBT design; a 7-hole design modiﬁed slightly from the VLT SPHERE mask; the 9-hole mask currently on Keck/NIRC2.

2. MASK DESIGNS

The design of sparse aperture masks that are fully non-redundant is challenging. Masks with large numbers of
holes are diﬃcult to produce, as are masks with large holes. This is due to the ﬁnite size of holes; a baseline
between two holes can be chosen in more ways when the hole diameter is larger. Non-redundant masks with
fewer or smaller holes are easier to design, although throughput is reduced. For these reasons, mask designs are
frequently generated using computational methods.10, 13, 15

Three mask designs were used in this study, with 9, 7, and 6 holes. These masks, as projected onto the Keck
primary mirror, are shown in Fig. 1. To develop SCALES NRM simulation tools and as a ﬁrst exploration of
mask designs, the three masks were either chosen or modiﬁed from designs currently in use. The 9-hole mask
design is currently in use in Keck/NIRC2. The 7- and 6-hole designs were modiﬁed from VLT SPHERE and
LBT designs, respectively. The modiﬁcations were required in order to ensure that the holes do not overlap
any mirror segment edges or spiders. Furthermore, several holes were adjusted in both in order to add longer
baselines to the conﬁguration and to ensure non-redundancy.

3. SIMULATED OBSERVATIONS

SCALES observations with each mask were simulated using the scalessim software. An observing scene was
produced with a 10000K point source centered in the frame. A cube of PSFs was generated for each mask at
oversampled spatial and spectral resolutions with respect to the SCALES low-resolution mode and was then
convolved with the observing scene. The resulting cube was downsampled to coarser wavelength bins to match
the SCALES low-spectral-resolution mode (λmin = 2.0µm, λmax = 5.2µm, R < 300). A cube of raw images was
then generated with an FOV of 2.2” x 2.2”, spaxel plate scale of 0.02”/pixel, and integration times of 1s and
3600s to simulate cases of short and long exposures. Ten frames were generated at each wavelength with random
Poisson noise added. Further details about the scalessim data reduction pipeline are given in Ref. 16.

The Python-based SAMpy package was used to generate closure phases and squared visibilities. Closure phases
for each mask, wavelength bin, and integration time simulated in this study are shown plotted versus average

baseline length in Fig. 3. A supergaussian ﬁlter was applied to the SCALES frames to remove edge eﬀects before
these were calculated. The closure phases and squared visibilities were then calibrated as discussed in Section
3.1 and were used to generate contrast curves.

3.1 OPD Maps and Calibration

Keck AO performance was modelled by applying realistic Keck AO residuals to the PSF cube. These data were
simulated for the PyWFS operating in the H-band and with 0.66” seeing. One second of data were generated
with a sampling rate of 1kHz. These data were averaged and then evolved using a degree 500 Zernike polynomial
(see Ref. 17) to represent changing wavefront error between a science target and a calibration PSF. Calibration
PSFs are used to remove high-order noise that is not eliminated by closure phases or squared visibilities, which
remove instrumental errors to ﬁrst order.18 Care was taken to ensure that the standard deviation of the evolved
OPD map matches that of the original OPD data. The evolved map reliably reproduces the image quality
of Keck/NIRC2 with PyWFS. A background correction was performed by subtracting frames with no source
injected. Further calibration was done by subtracting closure phases and dividing visibilities that were produced
using the evolved OPD map.

evolved using a 500 degree Zernike polynomial.

4. RESULTS

Fig. 3 shows the calibrated absolute closure phases, for each mask and wavelength bin, for each closure triangle
as a function of average baseline length for that triangle. Integration times of 1s and 3600s are shown. The
contrast curves generated using these closure phases are shown in Fig. 4 for a 5 − σ conﬁdence interval. These
are calculated by comparing χ2 values between single companion models to the null model for each dataset.
Mask performance in a given band can be assessed by the depth of their contrast curves. In the K and L bands,
a modest improvement in contrast can be observed between the 6- and 9-hole masks. The 3600s integration
time does not achieve signiﬁcantly better contrast than 1s in these bands due to the noise being dominated by
OPD evolution as opposed to the sky, although there is some visible improvement with longer integration in
the L-band. The M-band shows signiﬁcant sky noise that is considerably mitigated with a longer integration.
This can also be seen in the reduced closure phase scatter of Fig. 3. The 6-hole mask appears to oﬀer improved
contrast over the 7- and 9-hole masks in the background limit; this could be due to the simpler 6-hole pattern
producing overall larger fringes that stand out better from the sky background.

5. FUTURE WORK

Designing fully non-redundant aperture masks that are optimized for direct imaging studies is a challenging
process. In future work, we will systematically generate a larger, more diverse sample of masks to test with
the SCALES mask simulation pipeline presented here. Varying parameters such as number and size of holes,
geometry, and degree of redundancy will be explored. Attempts will be made to achieve uniform u-v snapshot
coverage that may be optimized for diﬀerent targets. For example, masks with a wide range of baseline lengths,
including several long baselines, could perform better when imaging extended targets with complex spatial
features than masks lacking long baselines. Additional methods of assessing mask performance will also be
implemented, including by injecting and attempting to recover a variety of science targets (e.g., companions,
disks, or both). This work will be continued with the eventual goal of designing and testing a non-redundant
aperture mask that is suitable for integration with SCALES.
