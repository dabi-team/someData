1 BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE PROPERTIES OF COMMUNITY SPLIT AND SHRINK INDICES
Let I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖 denote the community split and shrink indices, respectively. Without loss of generality, we
assume 𝑚 ≥ 1. The properties of the two indices are as follows.

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 and I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 and I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 are strictly monotonic increasing functions of 𝑚, given 0 < 𝜂𝑖 < 1, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 =

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 / I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic decreasing / increasing function of 𝜂𝑖, respectively, for 𝜂𝑖 > 0, given

𝑚 > 1, and member migration distribution ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗, 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚 with H𝑐𝑡,𝑖

> 0.

P-3. Given 𝑚 and 𝜂𝑖, the maximum split index I𝜓
𝑡→𝑡+1 is obtained when the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖
𝑐𝑡,𝑖
migrate to the communities detected in the next step with a even distribution, i.e., when we have ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1
𝑚 , 𝑗 =
1, 2, · · · , 𝑚. And the minimum split index I𝜓
= 0 is obtained when 𝑚 = 1 or all the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖 who stay in
𝑐𝑡,𝑖
the project migrate to a single community in the next step, i.e., there exists a 𝑗 ′-th community in time 𝑡 + 1 that
ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗′ = 1 and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 0, ∀𝑗 ≠ 𝑗 ′, resulting in H𝑐𝑡,𝑖

= (1 − 𝜂𝑖)H ∗

P-4. Given 𝑚 > 1 and 𝜂𝑖, the maximum shrink index I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖

𝑡→𝑡+1 is obtained when the corresponding
split index is minimized, i.e., all stayed members of community 𝑐𝑡,𝑖 migrate to a single community in the next
step. And the minimum shrink index I𝜂
𝑖 H ∗
𝑡→𝑡+1 is obtained when the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖 migrate evenly to
𝑐𝑡,𝑖
communities in time 𝑡 + 1. For the special case of 𝑚 = 1, the shrink index is only determined by 𝜂𝑖.

Fig. 1. Curves of the split and shrink indices under diﬀerent conditions specified by 𝑚, 𝜂𝑖, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 . The even distribution
corresponds to case ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, · · · , 𝑚. The random distribution is obtained by randomly assigning ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 ’s values.

Fig. 1 illustrates the curves of the split and shrink indices under diﬀerent conditions, from which we can ﬁnd

correspondence to the above properties.

2 PROOF OF THE PROPERTIES
The proof of the above four properties are as follows.
P-1. I𝜓
Proof. First, for community split index I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 and I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 are strictly monotonic increasing functions of 𝑚, given 0 < 𝜂𝑖 < 1, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚.

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 , take the partial derivative of I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 with respect to 𝑚 gives us:

When ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚, we have H𝑐𝑡,𝑖

ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 log2 ( ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 ) = − log2

Substitute Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we have

(3)

We can see from Eq. (3) that
As a result, the community split index I𝜓

𝜕 I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖
𝜕𝑚

> 0, for 𝑚 ≥ 1, and 0 ≤ 𝜂𝑖 < 1.

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic increasing function of 𝑚, for 𝑚 ≥ 1, 0 ≤

𝜂𝑖 < 1, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚.

For the case of 𝜂𝑖 = 1, we always have I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖

= 0, ∀𝑚 ≥ 1, and regardless the distribution of ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗, 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚,

which is intuitively correct that a community cannot split if all of its members leaves the project.

Next, for community shrink index I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 , we also take its partial derivative with respect to 𝑚, which is

From Eq. (5), we have
For the case of 𝜂𝑖 = 0, we always have I𝜂
𝑐𝑡,𝑖

= 0, ∀𝑚 ≥ 1, given any member migration distribution ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗, 𝑗 =
1, 2, · · · , 𝑚, which is reasonable because a community does not shrink if none of its members leave the project,
regardless the number of communities detected in the next step (i.e., 𝑚).

> 0 for 𝑚 ≥ 1, 0 < 𝜂𝑖 ≤ 1, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚.

Combining the above two results, we show that: I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 and I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 are strictly monotonic increasing functions of

𝑚, given 0 < 𝜂𝑖 < 1, and ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1

𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚.

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic decreasing / increasing function of 𝜂𝑖, respectively, for 𝜂𝑖 > 0, given 𝑚 > 1,

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 / I𝜂

and member migration distribution ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗, 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚 with H𝑐𝑡,𝑖
Proof. First, we show that community split index I𝜓
the given conditions. The partial derivative of I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 with respect to 𝜂𝑖 is

> 0.

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic decreasing function of 𝜂𝑖 under

(6)

𝜕 I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖
𝜕𝜂𝑖

< 0, meaning that I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic decreasing function of 𝜂𝑖, as long as

As a result, we have

H𝑐𝑡,𝑖

> 0.

We have H𝑐𝑡,𝑖

= 0 and thus I𝜓
𝑐𝑡,𝑖

= 0, ∀𝜂𝑖 ∈ [0, 1] when only one of the ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 ’s is one with rest of the ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 ’s
equal to zero (including the case that 𝑚 = 1). Intuitively, this case means that a community is not regarded as
splitting if all of its remaining members migrate to a single community in the next step, regardless the amount
of members who leave the project.

Next, we show that community shrink index I𝜂
given conditions. Taking the partial derivative of I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic increasing function of 𝜂𝑖 under the
𝑐𝑡,𝑖 with respect to 𝜂𝑖 gives us

We also have

> 0 for 𝜂𝑖 > 0 and 𝑚 = 1. As a result, I𝜂

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic increasing function of 𝜂𝑖

Summarizing the above, we show that: I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖 is a strictly monotonic decreasing / increasing function of
𝜂𝑖, respectively, for 𝜂𝑖 > 0, given 𝑚 > 1, and the distribution of member migration ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗, 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚 with

> 0.

P-3. Given 𝑚 and 𝜂𝑖, the maximum split index I𝜓
𝑡→𝑡+1 is obtained when the members of 𝑐𝑡,𝑖 migrate
𝑐𝑡,𝑖
to the communities detected in the next step with a even distribution, i.e., when we have ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗 = 1
𝑚 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚.
And the minimum split index I𝜓

𝑐𝑡,𝑖
migrate to a single community in the next step, i.e., there exists a 𝑗 ′-th community in time 𝑡 + 1 that ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗′ = 1 and

the distribution of member migration speciﬁed by ˆ𝜓𝑖,𝑗, 𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , 𝑚. As a result, it is feasible for us to draw
meaningful results, such as the community shows a stronger trend of splitting / shrinking, by directly comparing
the values of community split and shrink indices.
