Abstract—Given the success of the open source phenomenon, it is not surprising that many
organizations are seeking to emulate this success by adopting open source practices internally
in what is termed InnerSource. However, while open source development and InnerSource are
similar in some aspects, they differ signiﬁcantly on others, and thus need to be implemented and
managed differently. To the best of our knowledge, there is no signiﬁcant account of a
successful InnerSource incentivization program. Here we describe a comprehensive InnerSource
incentivization program which was implemented at Huawei. The program is based on theories of
motivation, both intrinsic and extrinsic, and also includes incentives at the individual, project,
and divisional level, which helps to overcome the barriers that arise when implementing
InnerSource. The program has had very impressive early results, leading to signiﬁcant increases
in the number of InnerSource projects, contributors, departments, and lines of code contributed.

INTRODUCTION Over the past 25 years, the
Open Source Software (OSS) phenomenon has
arguably been the greatest disruptive force in
the software ﬁeld, demonstrating that high qual-
ity software can be produced by a globally-
distributed and largely-volunteer workforce, cer-
tainly countering early scepticism as to the future
of OSS [3]. This has had major implications
in both research and practice, and organizations
around the globe are incorporating open source
practices into the way they build and ship their
own software. This software development ap-
proach, commonly known as “InnerSource”, fo-
cuses on leveraging the Open Source development
model for developing proprietary software. The
popularity of InnerSource has increased dramat-
ically over the past few years, with many orga-
nizations, including major technology companies

like Microsoft, Huawei, Tencent, and PayPal, and
even non-IT companies like Bloomberg, Bosch,
and Nike embracing the culture. InnerSource
Commons, an online community of InnerSource
practitioners, has over 1,300 subscribers across
500 organizations.1

A number of signiﬁcant beneﬁts may arise
from successful implementation of InnerSource
[2], [12]. These include:

• Increased code reuse - Sharing of code and
collaborative development across organiza-
tional divisions ensures increased code reuse.
• Quality improvement - Greater level of review
of requirements, code, and testing facilitates
bug discovery (by leveraging Linus’s law —
“Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”)

and improves the overall quality of the soft-
ware product.

• Open innovation – Access to broad and deep
knowledge beyond the conﬁnes of the depart-
ment originally developing the software facil-
itates open innovation.

• Improved staff mobility - Greater familiarity
with development and interaction with col-
leagues outside departmental silos facilitates
staff mobility across divisions.

• Attracting and recruiting talented employees
– Most fresh graduates nowadays are familiar
with the open source model and would expect
and be attracted to a development environment
conducive to social coding rather than a tightly
controlled traditional one.

implementation of Inner-
However, successful
Source has long been a challenge [13], [10], and
signiﬁcant institutional change may be required
[8]. A number of barriers can arise in organiza-
tions which hinder InnerSource implementation,
as identiﬁed by the ‘2020 State of InnerSource
Survey’2. These include:

• Time constraints - Developers in organizations
are fully committed to their “day job” and
often do not have the capacity to take on
additional development tasks for InnerSource.
• Lack of recognition – The traditional perfor-
mance appraisal mechanisms are typically de-
signed for silos of organizational departments
and divisions, and often do not recognize
the pan-organizational nature of InnerSource.
Moreover, the developed code is not viewed
externally, so there is limited visibility of In-
nerSource contributions outside the company,
which doesn’t help an individual’s career as
much as OSS contributions.

• Lack of community support - The “free rider”
phenomenon, whereby individuals take more
than they contribute, which has been reported
for open source, applies to InnerSource also.
to
Contributors to InnerSource might want
grow through participation, but without
the
support of an active and supportive community,
they might end up working on maintenance
issues against their will, and might experience
frustration and burn-out in the process.

• Lack of management support – Lower and
middle management often focus more on short
term targets, prioritizing local development ac-
tivities over InnerSource work since there is no
immediate beneﬁt to their individual divisions.
• Liable to ﬁx code subsequently – Developers
may fear that contributing code to InnerSource
will require them to maintain that code indef-
initely, or be responsible for any issues that
might arise through use of the code.

• Fear of contributions being “hijacked” without
due credit – Somewhat in opposition to the
previous concern, developers may fear that
others will take credit for their InnerSource
contributions.

In order to successfully implement InnerSource
at an organization and realize its beneﬁts, it is
essential to address the barriers to InnerSource
adoption. This can be achieved through appro-
priate incentivization [6], however, designing a
suitable incentive program for facilitating Inner-
Source adoption is not trivial — InnerSource lies
the intersection of open source and closed
at
source development,
thus the motivations for
those involved are not exactly the same as either
in isolation [1]. Moreover,
to the best of our
knowledge, there is no existing research on a
structured incentive program tailored to facilitate
InnerSource adoption.

In this article, we address this gap by present-
ing the InnerSource implementation at Huawei
and the structured incentive program proposed for
facilitating its adoption.

Motivations for Open Source
Participation

While InnerSource and open source share
many similarities, they also differ on a number of
dimensions, including the nature of the workforce
and the locus of control [1]. We are not aware of
research on an incentive program designed specif-
ically for InnerSource. However, a lot of research
has focused on the motivations underpinning OSS
participation more generally. These include the
following broad categories:[14]

• Intrinsic motivators (e.g., Ideology, Kinship,

Enjoyment and Fun)

2State

of

Survey,

https://tapjdey.github.io/

InnerSource Survey 2020, Accessed on 2022-01-09.

• Extrinsic Motivators (e.g., Pay, Career)
• Internalised Extrinsic (e.g., Reputation, Learn-

2

ing, Reciprocity, Own-use)

We brieﬂy elaborate on each of these categories
below.

Intrinsic motivation has long been identiﬁed
as a key factor in open source. Ideology was at
the heart of the Free Software movement which
pre-dated open source. Closely related to this is
the concept of Kinship. Helping a group to which
open source developers feel a tie of kinship is thus
a strong motivator. Also, the idea of Enjoyment
and Fun is intrinsically motivating, and has been
identiﬁed as a core aspect of the ‘hacker culture’
in the 1980s that also fuelled the emergence of
open source.

Extrinsic motivation, such as pay and ca-
reer, has become a major factor in open source,
especially over the past few years. As more
companies become involved in open source and
as it becomes a key strategic component in the
software industry, the model whereby develop-
ers are paid to work on open source becomes
increasingly common[11]. Also, open source con-
tributions could be clearly attributed to individual
developers and hence these could form part of a
developer’s achievement that could support career
progression, employment, and promotion.

Some motivators, which might appear at ﬁrst
glance to be extrinsic, can also be internalized
by developers to the extent that they act as self-
regulating in terms of behavior. For example, rep-
utation is a major factor underpinning developer
in open source, especially among
involvement
peers. Learning is also a signiﬁcant motivator in
that developers can improve their skills through
the transparency of contributions which address
technical challenges. Reciprocity also belongs in
this internalized extrinsic category in that devel-
opers are happy to contribute according to their
strengths and expect
their contributions to be
reciprocated by others. Own-use value follows
from this as developers seek to consume open
source products for their personal use.

InnerSource Adoption at Huawei

Huawei is a Chinese multinational technology
corporation headquartered in Shenzhen, China.
It designs, develops and sells telecommunica-
tions equipment, consumer electronics, and var-
ious smart devices. Huawei has almost 200,000

employees and has deployed its products and
services in more than 170 countries. It was ranked
as the second-largest R&D investor in the world
by the EU Joint Research Centre in 2021.

Due to its size,

there is a lot of human
potential in Huawei that is hard to utilize fully in a
traditional governance system. Therefore, Huawei
decided to adopt InnerSource to promote pan-
organizational knowledge-sharing and open inno-
vation. There are four key mechanisms supporting
the InnerSource adoption at Huawei, viz.
the
governance mechanism,
the infrastructure sup-
port, the promotion & training, and the structured
incentive program for InnerSource contributors.
We discuss the ﬁrst
three mechanisms brieﬂy
below in order to provide some context before
we discuss the incentive program in detail in the
following sections.

InnerSource Governance

In order to oversee the task of InnerSource
adoption, Huawei have established a very high-
level InnerSource Foundation across the entire
organization. This is chaired by a Huawei Fellow,
and its members include the President of each
Product Line and the Director of each R&D
department. The mandate of this Foundation is
to approve Huawei’s InnerSource policies, char-
ters, mechanisms, and plans. It is also charged
with promoting and advocating the InnerSource
concept throughout the organization and building
a healthy InnerSource ecosystem, culture, and
climate.

This InnerSource Foundation is further under-
pinned by an InnerSource Technical Committee
(TC), again chaired by a Huawei Fellow and com-
prising as members the Chief Software Engineers
of each Product Line. The TC is the primary
committee coordinating InnerSource activities at
Huawei. The remit of the Technical Committee is
to:

1) Select and establish the appropriate In-
nerSource technology communities and
projects based on the overall strategy and
direction of the Board of Directors.

2) Deﬁne the phases (preparation, incubation,
and graduation) and requirements of In-
nerSource projects, review and approve In-
nerSource communities and projects, and

2022

guide the operation of each InnerSource
project.

3) Responsible for developing, maintaining
and publishing the Huawei
InnerSource
License, and arbitrating technical disputes
arising from non-compliance with Inner-
Source usage.

4) Responsible for promoting and spreading
the culture of InnerSource, and motivat-
ing and recognizing InnerSource technol-
ogy communities, projects, and individuals
with outstanding contributions.

In addition to the TC,

there are Technical
Community Committees (TCCs) speciﬁc to each
product line for overseeing InnerSource activities
and facilitating communications among members
of different product lines. The TCCs review and
approve InnerSource communities and projects,
appoint Project Management Committees (PMCs)
for InnerSource projects,
identify InnerSource
opportunities in the technology domain, build
a healthy and vibrant InnerSource technology
ecosystem, evangelize the InnerSource culture,
motivate and commend outstanding InnerSource
technology communities, projects, and individu-
als, and publicize InnerSource concepts to other
departments.

The PMC is the technical management com-
mittee for each InnerSource project, consisting
of project maintainer representatives and other
stakeholders, including management. PMCs are
tasked with ensuring three key requirements:

1) The InnerSource project is consistent with
the strategy and values of the department.
2) Ensuring credit for contributions to the In-
nerSource project is attributed correctly to
the the actual contributors, and also that
contributions do not result in an unreason-
able demand for maintenance subsequently.
3) Ensuring that contributors have autonomy
and can focus on building up personal rep-
utation and inﬂuence through InnerSource.

InnerSource Infrastructure

Infrastructure support is a necessary compo-
nent for successful InnerSource implementation
[7], [4]. A team of engineers at Huawei help in the
design and implementation of required compo-
nents, e.g., an InnerSource portal and dashboard

showcasing the active projects and individual
proﬁles of InnerSource contributors, their activity
and badges/awards. They also help in tracking the
activity of projects and developers using various
metrics as required by the wider community of
InnerSource participants in the organization.

InnerSource Promotion & Training

Since

InnerSource operates quite differ-
ently from traditional development operations at
Huawei, having standard procedures is key for
ensuring the InnerSource community can thrive.
The two main goals for setting up the pro-
cesses are ﬁrstly spreading awareness about In-
nerSource within the company to help attract
new developers via various online and ofﬂine
promotional activities, such as meet-and-greet
sessions, hackathons, new developer meets, and
secondly, ensuring smooth operation of exist-
ing InnerSource projects, e.g, asynchronous and
collaborative development, meritocracy, etc. by
providing training to InnerSource participants.
The processes are overseen by the InnerSource
governing bodies at different levels, who design
and promote InnerSource standards and practices,
ensure that the rules are followed, and act as
arbiters in case of any disputes.

Designing an InnerSource Incentive
Program at Huawei

In-
In order to facilitate the adoption of
nerSource and recognize employee contributions
to InnerSource projects, Huawei has designed
and implemented a structured incentive program,
which is a complement
to Huawei’s existing
employee appraisal system, as discussed below.
In designing the InnerSource incentive pro-
gram at Huawei, a number of the fundamental
concepts underpinning motivation were drawn
on. These include Maslow’s proposed hierarchy
of needs from physiological and safety needs
to those of esteem, and self-actualization. In a
similar vein, Herzberg’s two-factor theory [5]
identiﬁes both hygiene factors and motivating
factors. Hygiene factors, if not present, will cause
an employee to work less and lead to dissat-
isfaction, while motivating factors will encour-
age an employee to work harder and can bring
about satisfaction. More contemporary thinking
on motivation was drawn from Daniel Pink’s

4

Drive concept which identiﬁes three categories of
motivation – autonomy, mastery and purpose [9].

These concepts were vital in designing the
InnerSource incentive program at Huawei. The-
ories on general motivation were combined with
empirical and contextual knowledge, viz. the re-
search ﬁndings on OSS developer motivation and
research on existing employee appraisal frame-
works, as well as the management styles of large
OSS communities such as Linux and the Apache
Software Foundation, to come up with a concrete
strategy for tackling the barriers to InnerSource
adoption, and motivating individual developers,
potential project maintainers, and management to
adopt InnerSource.

Hygiene/Deﬁciency Factors

Many of the barriers to InnerSource adoption
are conceptually similar to the lower levels of
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, e.g. Physiological
and Safety needs, and can be thought of as
‘hygiene’ factors - they are necessary precursors
to initiate InnerSource adoption but do not ac-
tively create an InnerSource culture. These factors
include - time constraints, lack of support from
management and peer groups, fear of not receiv-
ing due credit for InnerSource contributions, and
having to maintain code indeﬁnitely.

Research on InnerSource suggests that support
from top management, colloquially known as
‘Executive Air Cover’, is essential for effective
adoption of InnerSource [12]. For Huawei, the
InnerSource Foundation and the active PMCs
ensure employees have adequate support from
management for undertaking InnerSource work.
This also reassures managers at lower levels of
the organization, who control the workload of
developers in their teams, that there is higher-
level managerial support for InnerSource activ-
ities. The regular publicizing activities, including
developer meet-ups and workshops, also educate
developers about how InnerSource development
works (since it can be signiﬁcantly different from
the practices followed by individual teams). This
in turn results in more realistic expectations about
InnerSource and helps establish a more supportive
environment for InnerSource.

Motivation/Growth Factors

it

One of the key features of InnerSource is
that
is governed by meritocracy and free
choice by participants as to what to work on
and when [12]. The motivations for InnerSource
contributors, therefore, are conceptually similar to
the higher levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,
e.g., esteem and self-actualization. In Herzberg’s
terminology,
these are the ‘motivation’ factors
and promote growth both at an individual and
community level, ensuring the successful adop-
tion of InnerSource and realization of its nu-
merous beneﬁts, as discussed earlier. There are
two main types of such factors - Extrinsic and
Intrinsic factors. The extrinsic motivation factors
are related to the recognition of an individual’s
efforts, while the intrinsic motivations could be
categorized into Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose
using Pink’s Drive terminology [9]. By design,
Huawei tried to focus less on monetary rewards
and more on reputation-based incentives to avoid
the “Crowding-Out Effect” [15], which suggests
that offering too much extrinsic (monetary) re-
ward in the context of pre-existing intrinsic mo-
tivation can sometimes undermine the internal
motivation for doing that task, thus decreasing
the overall performance.

We brieﬂy elaborate on these factors below:
Recognition: Wanting to be honored and recog-
nized for one’s efforts is a basic human instinct
and it could act as a signiﬁcant motivation. Con-
tributing to InnerSource is an opportunity for in-
dividuals to showcase their work to a wider audi-
ence and gain recognition beyond their individual
divisions. This can act as a huge morale booster.
Huawei recognizes its importance as well and the
incentive program was designed to address this
issue.
Autonomy: In Huawei, the InnerSource working
model allows projects to independently deter-
mine and control the project direction over time.
The PMCs have autonomy, e.g., in deciding the
project direction, incentives within the project,
and project working methods. Moreover,
indi-
vidual contributors are also given freedom to
choose which projects they want to contribute
to and when. This preserves the spontaneity of
the InnerSource process and serves to address the
need for autonomy.
Mastery: Mastery refers to the desire to con-

2022

5

Figure 1. InnerSource Role Progression at Huawei

stantly improve one’s skills, which is seen as a
primary goal in itself, and not necessarily directly
equated with any extrinsic reward. Mastery is
also facilitated by autonomy in that InnerSource
contributors are able to choose where and how to
contribute. This allows them to choose areas of
contribution in which they already have expertise,
and have a desire to further develop that expertise.
Purpose: Being a company that is owned by its
employees (through an Employee Stock Owner-
ship Program), Huawei recognizes the value of
having a sense of loyalty and purpose. Since the
InnerSource projects are maintained by the PMCs
and contributions are voluntary, developers feel
an attachment to the project and strive for its
success. This, together with the other motivation
factors, gives them a sense of purpose and helps
them get closer to achieving self-actualization.

The Proposed Incentive Program

With the theoretical foundation for design-
ing an incentive program in place, Huawei has
drawn on their extensive experience in designing
effective employee appraisal systems to create
a structured incentive program for InnerSource.
The proposed program involves a comprehensive
reputation and honor system and a transparent
merit-based path for role progression based on an

individual’s contributions and reputation. There
are also special rewards and monetary incentives
for exceptional contributors, projects, and divi-
sions, as described below.

Contribution-based Reputation System

Individuals build up their contribution value
by making contributions to various InnerSource
projects. A couple of factors were prominent in
designing the reputation scheme -

1) While code contribution to InnerSource
projects is counted as the main source of an
individual’s InnerSource contribution value,
other types of contributions, e.g., documen-
tation, bug-reports, code-review, technical
discussions are all counted as valid contri-
butions.

2) An individual’s contribution value is cumu-
lative in nature, i.e. the contribution points
and the rewards granted never expire. How-
ever, an individual’s overall standing in the
reputation scale may reduce if others make
more contributions. This takes advantage
of the loss-aversion instinct of individuals,
since no one wants to lose a position they
have worked hard to reach, and it keeps
them motivated to continue contributing to

Honors and Awards

Role Progression

In order to promote fairness and transparency,
Huawei has adopted merit-based role progression
for InnerSource contributors. Contributors can
achieve a rank based on cumulative contribu-
tion across all InnerSource projects, as well as
achieving a more prominent role in the Inner-
Source project/community based on their reputa-
tion, subject to approval from the community. The
proposed role progression ladder for InnerSource
contributors at Huawei is shown in Figure 1. The
required number of contributions needed for rank
progression increases exponentially as a contrib-
utor’s rank increases.

As mentioned earlier, Huawei has also intro-
duced InnerSource Awards which are given to ex-
ceptional contributors, projects, and departments.
There are monetary as well as non-monetary
incentives associated with each of the awards.
By design, these awards are rare and are only
awarded in exceptional cases, so the motivation
crowding-out effect does not arise. The details
of the various rewards are described in Table 1.
It is worth noting here that while selecting the
awardees, Huawei does not simply look at total
number of contributions. The individual awards,
for example, not only recognize those who made
signiﬁcant technical contributions, but also re-
ward individuals for important managerial and
ambassadorial contributions. As for the projects,
they are evaluated based on the quality of ancil-
lary resources (e.g., README, documentation,

etc.), community management (e.g.,
issues/PR
handling, transparency in governance, etc.), and
their usefulness (e.g., number of users, user ex-
perience).

Wall of Honor

The Hall-of-Fame-styled Wall of Honor is
also incorporated into Huawei’s incentive pro-
gram to allow more contributions to be recorded
and demonstrated over the long term. The home-
page of the InnerSource dashboard contains infor-
mation about active InnerSource projects as well
as other related information about InnerSource,
and it is possible to navigate to the “Wall of
Honor” from the homepage. The Wall of Honor
includes the following:

1) Honorary presentation of TCs, TCCs, and
project PMCs (with personal information,
link to personal page), and
introduction,
Diamond and Platinum tier contributors.
2) The annual awards (InnerSource Knight
Award, Gold Badge Project Award, Black
Land Award) and awardees for each year.
3) The monthly awards (InnerSource Project
Timely Incentive Item, InnerSource Star)
and awardees for each month.

In addition, an individual’s personal proﬁle
page can also showcase information regarding
their contribution records, awards received, and
their current contributor tier and rank. Through
this page, visitors can learn about the technical

expertise and interests in InnerSource projects,
and can initiate mutual technical communication.

Results

The InnerSource implementation at Huawei is
still in its early days - the incentivization program
was ﬁrst proposed in the second half of 2020
and was elaborated and promoted more widely in
2021. As can be seen from Figure 2, the number
of departments involved with InnerSource, as well
as the number of InnerSource contributors and the
total size of the codebase across all InnerSource
projects, have increased dramatically since the
incentive program was introduced. Although the
number of new InnerSource projects in the ﬁrst
half of 2022 is relatively lower, it should be noted
that
in 2021, a greater proportion of projects
started in the second half of the year, and we
expect this to be repeated in 2022. Moreover, sev-
eral projects and contributors have been awarded
various awards listed in Table 1 and some contrib-
utors have already reached the “Gold” tier (ref:
Figure 1).
It

to determine
complete cause and effect for all aspects of the
incentive program – this would require a random-
ized controlled trial, which is very difﬁcult to
conduct at this scale. However, given that several
Huawei engineers had cited the lack of incentives
as a barrier when InnerSource was re-introduced
in late 2019, and that several expressed a positive
attitude towards the proposed incentive program

is not possible at present

since it was introduced, we are inclined to believe
the incentive program has had a positive effect.

Conclusion

As mentioned earlier, numerous organizations
across multiple domains have sought to imple-
ment InnerSource. However,
implementing In-
nerSource is extremely complex and many or-
ganizations fail [2], [12]. An appropriate incen-
tivization mechanism is key to its successful
implementation. This is no trivial undertaking
as both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations need
to be incorporated carefully in order to avoid
crowding out and ensuring that the incentives are
appropriate at individual, department and project
levels.

The incentive program discussed here has
been a key mechanism in ensuring the success
of InnerSource at Huawei. We believe this will
serve as a good example of how to design an
incentive program for InnerSource and be useful
to other practitioners in the ﬁeld.
