Abstract

Low latency and reliable information transfer are highly
demanded in 5G and beyond 5G wireless communica-
tions. However,
the conventional media access con-
trol (MAC) protocol for local wireless networks some-
times unexpectedly yields signiﬁcant delays due to its
stochastic arbitration mechanism, resulting in the incapa-
bility of limiting the maximum delay. In the meantime,
the latest precise time synchronization technology, espe-
cially wireless two-way interferometry (Wi-Wi), paves a
new way to overcome such fundamental difﬁculties. In-
deed, Yamasaki et al. proposed a new delay-bounded
wireless MAC protocol named Carrier Sense Multiple
Access with Arbitration Point (CSMA/AP), exploiting
precise time synchronization among all devices in the
network. CSMA/AP enables collision-free and delay-
bounded communications with a simple autonomous arbi-
tration mechanism, unlike conventional methods such as
CSMA/CA. The former study, however, was limited only
to numerical examinations. Experimental demonstration
and veriﬁcation in wireless environments are one of the
most critical steps. This paper experimentally demon-
strates the fundamental principles of CSMA/AP by con-
structing a star-topology wireless network using software-
deﬁned radio terminals combined with precise time syn-
chronization devices. We show that CSMA/AP is suc-
cessfully operated, including the dynamic change of the
spatial position of the terminal or the capability to ac-

Introduction

The explosively increasing importance of wireless com-
munications requires high-speed operation and reliability
in various applications and industries [1–3]. A recom-
mendation from ITU-R highlighted the related critical is-
sues [4]. It emphasized the enhanced Mobile Broad-Band
(eMBB) usage scenario, aiming at high-data-rate access
for mobile devices. Herein, space- and time-division mul-
tiplexing technologies play essential roles in achieving
high-speed communication, notably by Massive Multiple-
Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) [5], which requires time
synchronization among base stations. Various applica-
tions other than general telecommunications also require
precise time synchronization, e.g., factory automation,
power delivery networks, vehicular communications, and
wireless live audio/video production [6].

Several time synchronization technologies are established
and used for mobile communications. One widely used
technology is the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) [7]. However, its synchronization performance
degrades depending on the environments being used. In
particular, satellite information is unavailable in typical
indoor environments. Furthermore, the costs to maintain
and update satellite equipment are high. The Precision
Time Protocol (PTP) [8] is another way for precise time
synchronization. However, its precision and applicabil-
ity are limited due to its inability to manage dynamically
changing uncertain network structures, especially on short
time scales.

With such backgrounds and contexts, Shiga et al. have
developed a time synchronization technology called Wire-
less Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi in short) [9]. In Wi-

Wi, the devices under the network exchange their time
information with each other, allowing them to update
their internal clocks autonomously and recognize relative
spatial distance information. That is, time- and space-
synchronization is accomplished by Wi-Wi. The prin-
ciple of Wi-Wi is reviewed in Section II below. Ulti-
mately, terminals with Wi-Wi are time-synchronized at a
picosecond-level precision. It should be emphasized that
Wi-Wi does not need expensive instruments; commer-
cially available semiconductor devices and crystal oscilla-
tors are the underlying substrates of Wi-Wi [9]. These lat-
est advancements in time- and space-synchronization are
foundations of the present study regarding delay-bounded
communications.

Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is
another important aspect of telecommunications that ITU-
R proposed [4]. Low latency communication is manda-
tory in various large-scale industrial applications, such as
healthcare, transport and automotive, entertainment, and
manufacturing [1]. From the perspective of reliable com-
munications, the strictly bounded time delay is crucial for
real-time systems, especially hard real-time systems im-
posing a rigid deadline or predictable real-time wherein
the worst latency is predicted before communications.

However, contemporary wireless communication meth-
ods require complex arbitration mechanisms to deal with
collisions (i.e., interferences) caused by multiple simul-

taneous accesses.
tiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), a
widely used arbitration method for wireless LAN, re-
lies on the random back-off algorithm to avoid collisions.
CSMA/CA works well when the trafﬁc load is low; how-
ever, the wait time increases signiﬁcantly when the trafﬁc
load is high. Moreover, due to its stochastic behaviors,
communication delays over CSMA/CA cannot be deter-
ministically predicted even in a low-trafﬁc regime. There
are other arbitration methods with guarantees of maxi-
mum delay [10–13]. However, they have difﬁculties in
scalability, low-trafﬁc performance, and equality among
terminals.

Concerning the abovementioned backgrounds, we con-
sider that time synchronization is a promising resource in
providing highly reliable wireless communications.
In-
deed, Yamasaki et al. proposed a novel media access
control method named Carrier Sense Multiple Access
with Arbitration Point (CSMA/AP) to accomplish strictly
delay-bounded wireless communication by exploiting that
all devices are precisely time-synchronized [14].
In
CSMA/AP, communication opportunities are speciﬁed by
Arbitration Points (AP), which are periodically assigned
for all devices. Hence, CSMA/AP provides all terminals
with collision-free and equal transmission opportunities.
Fig. 1(a) schematically illustrates the proposed protocol.
It should be emphasized that CSMA/AP guarantees the
upper bound of communication delay, and it completely
relies on time synchronization among terminals. Wi-Wi,
schematically shown in Fig. 1(b), is the most feasible

enabler to provide precise time synchronization among
many terminals.

The former study of CSMA/AP [14], however, has been
limited to theoretical and numerical demonstrations.
In
[14], preliminary experimental studies were also pre-
sented, but they were based on wired connections. Thus,
experimental demonstrations and veriﬁcations to examine
the feasibility and the utility of time synchronization for
delay-bounded communications in wireless environments
are indispensable. Therefore, in this paper, we demon-
strate the fundamental principles of CSMA/AP by imple-
menting them in software-deﬁned radio systems operating
in the 2.4 GHz regime while combined with wireless time
synchronization devices, called Wi-Wi modules, operated
at the 920 MHz communication band. We demonstrate
the successful operation of CSMA/AP in wireless envi-
ronments, including its capability to manage the devices
moving around in the conﬁgured network. We also ex-
perimentally demonstrate that CSMA/AP does not work
without precise time synchronization. Meanwhile, we ex-

perimentally characterized the precise time synchroniza-
tion itself by redeﬁning frequency stability as the stability
of synchronization to the reference clock.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews
the fundamentals of Wi-Wi and CSMA/AP. Section III
demonstrates the synchronization ability of Wi-Wi in a
variety of timescales. Section IV describes experimental
demonstrations of CSMA/AP and shows the results. Sec-
tion V concludes the paper.

II Preliminaries

A Time Synchronization Technology: Wi-Wi

Wireless Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi) [9] is a tech-
nology to achieve precise time and frequency synchro-
nization among clocks. It employs techniques for stan-
dard time comparison between remote sites [15] and syn-
chronizes oscillators. By sharing precisely synchronized
clocks, the variation in distance between antennas can also
be obtained.

The fundamentals of Wi-Wi come from Two-Way Satel-
lite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) [15], which
was developed to compare standard time via geostationary
satellite signals. There are two technologies; Two-Way
Time Transfer (TWTT) [15] and Carrier-Phase Two-Way
satellite frequency transfer (TWCP) [16].

We ﬁrst review the principle of time synchronization us-
ing TWTT. TWTT assumes that clocks exchange their
time information via two-way communication through the
same physical route. tc is the time difference between the
two clocks; in other words, a time point is observed by the
clock B tc after the clock A observes the same time point.
Then, the time difference calculated when the terminal at
A receives time information after the propagation delay td
is given as follows:

tA = TBA − TBB = −tc + td

(1)

where tA denotes the time difference calculated at A. TBB
and TBA are the time when time information from B ar-
rives at B and A, respectively. Also, the time difference is
obtained at B in the same way as follows:

tB = TAB − TAA = tc + td

(2)

where tB denotes the time difference calculated at B. TAA
and TAB are when time information from A arrives at A
and B, respectively. Assuming a single round trip time
is sufﬁciently small, we can obtain the time difference tc
and the propagation delay td as follows:

tc =

td =

tB − tA
2
tB + tA
2

.

(3)

(4)

TWCP provides the time difference information in the
same manner while using the carrier phase instead of
timestamps. We can rewrite tc by using the carrier phase
information:

tc =

φc
4πf0

=

φB − φA + 2πMc
4πf0

(5)

where f0 is the carrier frequency, φc = φB − φA + 2πMc
is the phase difference between two terminals, and Mc is
an integer. φA and φB are obtained from measured phases
similarly to (1) and (2). While tc cannot be determined
by only TWCP due to the integer ambiguity Mc, the vari-
ation of tc can be tracked over time if the variation of φc
between successive observations is less than π.

Based on the technique described above, Wi-Wi can syn-
chronize terminals at remote sites via wireless communi-
cation. Each terminal has to calculate quantities given by
(3), (4), and (5) to get the actual time difference, meaning
that one and a half roundtrip timestamp exchanges and
carrier phase measurements are needed.

With precisely synchronized clocks, we can measure the
distance between them as follows:

c
4πf0

ld := c · td = −

(φA + φB + 2πMc)

= −

(cid:18) φA + φB
2π

+ Mc

(cid:19) c

2πf0

(6)

where ld is the propagation distance between the two ter-
minals, equal to the product of the speed of light c and
the propagation delay td [17]. There remains the integer
ambiguity Mc; however, this can be resolved in the same
manner as the measurement of tc. Also, the horizontal
atmospheric propagation delay and, therefore, the water
vapor distribution can be measured [18].

Yasuda et al. [18] have developed a compact electronic
module implementing Wi-Wi principles, referred to as the
Wi-Wi module. When Wi-Wi modules are in a state called
phase-lock, the built-in crystal oscillators are synchro-
nized to the leader module’s oscillator by PID feedback
control and provide precise time-synchronized one pulse-
per-second (PPS) signals and 10 MHz signals. The PPS
signals that the Wi-Wi modules provide have synchroniza-
tion errors that roughly follow a normal distribution with
3σ = 400 ns [19].

B Delay-Bounded MAC Protocol: CSMA/AP

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Arbitration Point
(CSMA/AP) is a contention-based media access con-
trol protocol for wireless networks, realizing collision-
free arbitration by employing precise time synchroniza-
tion [14]. Thanks to the collision-freeness property and
the equality of transmission opportunities among termi-
nals, CSMA/AP can guarantee the upper boundary of
communication delay. Here, we brieﬂy summarize the
principle of CSMA/AP.

Therefore, obtaining tc allows the synchronization of both
clocks.

The core idea of CSMA/AP is the notion of an Arbitra-
tion Point (AP), a time duration periodically assigned and

of synchronization, here we evaluate the stability of syn-
chronization using rubidium clocks and Wi-Wi modules.

We used the Allan deviation [20] to evaluate the stability
of synchronization. Let y denote the fractional frequency
offset:

dΦ(t)

where Φ is the difference in instantaneous phase between
the reference clock signal and the measurement target sig-
nal, and ν0 is the nominal frequency. In practice, the time

sions controlled by CSMA/AP when the number of termi-

ing data.

shared among all terminals. Each terminal is periodi-
cally assigned to a completely distinct AP. Furthermore,
the timing of the AP for a terminal is autonomously de-
tected thanks to precise time synchronization. Fig. 2 is
the timing chart of APs and data transmissions controlled
by CSMA/AP. When a terminal undergoes the time dura-
tion of an AP, it checks or senses the environment during
this AP duration; namely, carrier sense is conducted. If
the terminal senses that the channels idle in this desig-
nated AP duration, it can start data transmission. Other-
wise, it must postpone the transmission until the next AP
timing. Based on the periodic assignment of APs to the
terminals, the terminal can surely start data transmission
no later than (N + 1) rounds of AP duration when N ter-
minals are in the network, leading to strictly ensuring the
upper bound of delay [14].

variants;

CSMA/AP has
CSMA/AP-T and
CSMA/AP-TS [14]. CSMA/AP-T utilizes only time
synchronization and distributes APs in equally spaced
time intervals. Meanwhile, CSMA/AP-TS employs
space localization in addition to time synchronization
and optimizes assignment order and intervals between
successive APs. Remember that Wi-Wi allows capturing

conﬁgured in a much denser manner in the time domain

Therefore,

III Wi-Wi Frequency Stability and

Synchronization

Atomic clocks are more stable than ordinary crystal oscil-
lators in frequency stability. However, what is critical for
CSMA/AP is that all devices are synchronized. That is,
synchronization is more important than the stability of in-
dividual oscillators. To quantitatively examine the impact

is obtained, and the Allan deviation σy(τ ) is deﬁned as
follows:

σy(τ ) =

(cid:114)(cid:68)

(y(t + τ ; τ ) − y(t; τ ))2(cid:69)
.

(9)

The Allan deviation σy(τ ) characterizes the change of y
on the timescale τ [20].

The Allan deviation is often used to evaluate the fre-
quency stability of a single clock; however, it can be in-
terpreted as a metric for the stability of synchronization
between the reference clock and the measurement target.
The less Φ(t) alters over time, which means two clocks
generate signals of close frequencies or are well synchro-
nized, the lower σy(τ ) becomes.

We used two rubidium clocks (SIM940, Standard Re-
search Systems) and two Wi-Wi modules. The rubidium
clocks and Wi-Wi modules provide 10 MHz square wave
signals. The relative frequency stability between two sig-
nals, or the Allan deviation, was measured by a frequency
stability measurement apparatus (SD5M01A, Anritsu).

The orange × marks in Fig. 3 show the Allan deviation
when two rubidium clocks were compared. Similarly, the
green + marks examine the Allan deviation when a rubid-
ium clock and a Wi-Wi module were compared. Finally,
the blue ∗ marks show the Allan deviation when two syn-
chronized Wi-Wi modules were compared.

From Fig. 3, ﬁrst, in the timescale τ < 1 s, two rubid-
ium clocks exhibit excellent stability compared with the
other two cases. However, what should be emphasized is
that the stability of two Wi-Wi modules outperforms two
rubidium clocks when τ ≥ 1 s. Furthermore, the Allan
deviation of the Wi-Wi module pair is approximately pro-
portional to τ −1. This means that additive noise outside
the feedback loop was the dominant source of the insta-
bility [20]. In other words, the result clearly demonstrates
that the two-way feedback control of Wi-Wi successfully
synchronizes the two oscillators. In the meantime, the Al-
lan deviation regarding the synchronization between a ru-
bidium clock and a Wi-Wi module, denoted by green +
marks, monotonically increases in the timescale beyond
approximately τ of 1 s. This indicates that a diffusion
process is inherent, which prevents the synchronization

A Experiment details

A.1 Physical Setup

Fig. 4(a) schematically illustrates the architecture of the
experimental system where a star-topology wireless net-
work is conﬁgured. One terminal operates as a base sta-
tion (BS) while the other two work as terminal stations
called STA 1 and STA 2. Here we consider the uplink
data transmission from STA 1 to BS and STA 2 to BS. The
data transfer is via 2.4 GHz carrier by software-deﬁned
radio devices (SDR). Each of the terminals is combined
with a Wi-Wi module, leading to precise time synchro-
nization among all terminals. The Wi-Wi module uses
the 920 MHz band for communications and provides 1
PPS trigger signal and a 10 MHz reference signal to the
connected SDR. Each of the SDRs is connected to a host
computer for data logging.

Fig. 4(b) shows the overview of the experiment environ-
ment and the apparatuses. All experiments are conducted
in an electromagnetic anechoic chamber with ﬁve faces
except the ﬂoor covered with absorbing materials [21].

A.2 Communication Speciﬁcation

Fig. 5 shows the timing chart of the behavior of the termi-
nals or SDRs which are operated in CSMA/AP. An SDR
waits for a designated trigger signal via the PPS signal
provided by the Wi-Wi module, which speciﬁes the start-
ing time of the AP. The SDR senses the carrier during AP.
Then, if the channel is vacant, the SDR starts transmis-
sion. In the present experimental system, we used Differ-
ential Binary-Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK) as the modu-
lation format, with a symbol rate of 500 ksymbols/s. The
size of a packet was 500 kbits; therefore, one transmis-
sion took 1 s. STA 1 ﬁrst transmits a packet for one sec-
ond, followed by the transmission from STA 2, and then
both STA 1 and STA 2 do not transmit data in the follow-
ing slot. Then the same procedure repeats. More details
about carrier sense and packet contents are described in
Appendix A and B.

B Sensitivity Analysis of Arbitration Point

The precision timing arrangement among the terminals is
critical for CSMA/AP via way of APs. Therefore, we ﬁrst
investigate the crucial parameters associated with APs and
examine their impacts on communications performance.

We consider two parameters: (i) AP duration and (ii) AP
offset. AP duration speciﬁes the time length of a single
AP, whereas AP offset is the time gap of consecutive APs,
schematically shown in Fig. 5. We checked the bit error
rate (BER) of the uplink data transfer from STAs to BS
as a function of AP duration ranging from 1 µs to 4096 µs
while ﬁxing AP offset to 100 µs. Similarly, AP offset de-
pendency was examined by setting AP offset from 1 µs to
1024 µs, with AP duration being ﬁxed at 900 µs. In this
experiment, the antennas were located at the vertices of
an equilateral triangle with a side length of 5 meters. For

Figure 3: The Allan deviations of fractional frequency off-
set. Lower deviation corresponds to a more stable fre-
quency source. A single crystal oscillator in a Wi-Wi
module (Rb – Wi-Wi) was less stable than a rubidium
clock (Rb – Rb). However, synchronized Wi-Wi modules
(Wi-Wi – Wi-Wi) outperformed asynchronous rubidium
clocks (Rb – Rb), where τ was longer than or equal to 1 s.

between the atomic clock and the crystal oscillator in Wi-
Wi. This observation is natural since there is no synchro-
nization mechanism between these two.

Additionally, the Allan deviation of two rubidium clocks
increases beyond the timescale τ of approximately
1 × 102 s. This fact indicates that, despite the excellent
stability of individual atomic clocks, such individual ex-
cellence does not assure the stability of synchronization
between the two.

In summing up, the experimental characterization indi-
cates that Wi-Wi excels in synchronization greater than
atomic clocks, especially in long timescales. Once again,
what is critical in CSMA/AP is synchronization among
multiple devices, which Wi-Wi satisﬁes.

IV Experimental Demonstration

Experimental veriﬁcation is an essential step in the devel-
opment of CSMA/AP. This study experimentally demon-
strates CSMA/AP implemented in software-deﬁned radio
systems combined with Wi-Wi modules. Also, we focus
on CSMA/AP-T since it encompasses the most founda-
tional aspect of CSMA/AP by exploiting the precise time
synchronization of all terminals in the network via Wi-Wi.

observed with parameters being 1 µs and 3 µs; we spec-
ulate that such error may be caused by a technical issue
in our current experimental setup of SDRs. Besides, ex-
ploration of much smaller AP parameters will be one of
our future studies, realizing a massive number of partici-
pants as reported in [14]. Based on these results, we use
5 or 10 µs for AP duration and AP offset in the following
experiments.

synchronization among the terminals, even in mobile en-
vironments.

C.1 Distance Dependency

We ﬁrst examine the range of successful transmission
among terminals to determine the range of the mobile ter-
minal. The positions of BS, STA 1, and STA 2 from an
isosceles triangle, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The po-
sitions of BS and STA 2 were ﬁxed and were 5 m apart,
whereas the location of STA 1 was conﬁgured differently
while being equidistant to BS and STA 2. Precisely, the
distance between STA 1 and the baseline connecting BS
and STA 2 was conﬁgured with 0 m, 2 m, . . . , 18 m.

The orange × and + marks in Fig. 7 show the BER of
transmitted data from STA 1 captured by BS when the pa-
rameter setting of AP duration and AP offset is conﬁgured
by both 5 µs and both 10 µs, respectively. The bottom edge
of the vertical axis for BER means that BER was zero,
demonstrating that the communication was successful at
all ranges in the range of inter-terminal distances.

Also, the green marks therein represent the radio power
level of Wi-Wi measured at STA 1, with AP parameter
settings being the same as described above. The power
gradually decreases as the distance between STA 1 and
BS increases. Indeed, the power level becomes too weak
when the distance reaches 14 m, resulting in the unsuc-
cessful operation of the system. Therefore, the operating
power of Wi-Wi needed to be increased when the distance
was between 14 m and 18 m. Besides, BS could not catch
radio waves from STA 1 at the 16 m position, seemingly
due to a null point; horizontally shifting the position of
STA 1 by about 15 cm resulted in successful transmission.

ear locus. (b) Curved locus.

C.2 Mobility Demonstration

Here we show the mobility demonstrations. The positions
of BS and STA 2 were ﬁxed with a 5 m distance apart,
which were the same as in the previous section, as indi-
cated by the orange and blue × marks in Fig. 8, respec-
tively. STA 1 was the mobile terminal, whose position
was tracked by an installed total station (a coordinate mea-
surement instrument. GT-1201/JBWD, Topcon Position-
ing Systems). AP duration and AP offset were both 10 µs.
Based on the distance limitations revealed by the previous
section, the distance between STA 1 and BS was within
14 m so that the power of Wi-Wi does not have to be re-
conﬁgured. In the mobility demonstrations, we examined
two kinds of trajectories of the mobile terminal (STA 1);
one was a straight proﬁle, and the other was a circular
one, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and 8(b), respectively, where
the green curves indicate the trace of STA 1 captured by
the total station.

The orange curve in Fig. 9(a) represents the time evolution
of the distance between BS and STA 1 measured with the
total station, denoted by φd (total station), when STA 1
explores along the straight line back and forth, as shown
in Fig. 8(a). Remember that Wi-Wi measures the inter-
device distance by exchanging the time and phase infor-
mation. The brown curve in Fig. 9(a) shows the time evo-
lution of the distance between BS and STA 1 measured

by Wi-Wi, denoted by φd (Wi-Wi), which exhibits good
agreement with the orange curve by the total station. This
result means that Wi-Wi successfully tracked the distance
variation due to the mobility of STA 1.

The green × and blue + marks in Fig. 9(a) demonstrate
the BER per packet regarding the data transfer from STA 1
to BS and from STA 2 to BS, respectively, where the
bottom line means error-free communications are accom-
plished. We can observe that there are no errors from
STA 2 to BS. Also, almost completely error-free com-
munications were also realized for the mobile terminal
(STA 1), demonstrating successful mobile communica-
tions.

Similarly, Fig. 9(b) summarizes the monitoring results of
the evolution of the distance measured by the total sta-
tion, BER per packet, and the status of Wi-Wi synchro-
nization when STA 1 follows the circular trajectory shown
in Fig. 8(b). The orange and brown curves exhibit simi-
lar traces, demonstrating that the distance measurements
by Wi-Wi work well to grasp the ground truth distance
proﬁle measured by the total station. On the other hand,
the BER per packet resulted in a higher error rate approx-
imately after 100 s. Furthermore, we conﬁrmed that the
PPS signals from the terminals became asynchronous at
approximately 150 s, indicated by the vertical dashed-dot
line in Fig. 9(b). The reason behind this phenomenon has
not been speciﬁed yet, which will be examined in future
studies.

The inter-device distances measured by Wi-Wi modules
successfully tracked the mobile terminal in the demon-
strations above. Precisely speaking, however, there were
at most approximately 1.4 m differences between φd mea-
sured by the Wi-Wi modules and that by the total station.
We consider that these errors are due to the miscalculation
of Mc in (6) caused by the reﬂection of radio waves on the
ﬂoor. In the previous research, the distance between an-
tennas was set to about 400 mm [17], which was much
smaller than the distance between terminals in this exper-
iment, and the effect of reﬂections might be negligible in
that previous experiment.

Finally, we discuss the speed limit of the mobile stations.
The relative speed of terminals is limited to λ/4T based
on the principle of Wi-Wi, where λ is the wavelength of
the carrier used in Wi-Wi communications and T is the
interval of successive Wi-Wi data revision at the terminal.
Currently, λ is approximately 320 mm, and T is 50 ms;
therefore, the upper bound of the speed is about 6 km h−1,
which is a speed of a slowly walking pedestrian. The mo-
bility of the station (STA 1) was controlled by humans
who walked at an average walking pace, which satisﬁes
the boundary.

time synchronization. The conﬁguration of the terminals
was the same as Sec. B; the three stations are located 5 m
apart from each other. AP duration and AP offset were
both set to 5 µs.

The status of a Wi-Wi module can be conﬁgured as “syn-
chronized” or “desynchronized.” Data logging was con-
ducted for approximately 5 min with Wi-Wi modules syn-
chronized and 20 min when they were desynchronized.

In the meantime, the time difference between PPS signals
provided by STA 1 and STA 2 was monitored by an os-
cilloscope. Remember that PPS signals specify the timing
of APs at each terminal, meaning that the time difference
between them is critical in ensuring collision-free com-
munications.

BER per packet measured by the BS transmitted from
STA 1 and STA 2, respectively. Note that the bottom limit

curve therein shows the timing difference between STA 1
and STA 2. Here the time difference takes a positive value
when the PPS signals from STA 1 arrive earlier than that
from STA 2. Fig. 10(a) and 10(b) regard synchronized
and desynchronized situations, respectively.

In Fig. 10(a), with Wi-Wi being synchronized, the BER
per packet from STA 1 and STA 2 both exhibit no error
after approximately 70 s. An automatic adjustment was
in operation for the carrier sense signal level in the ini-
tial durations. The details of carrier sense are described in
Appendix A. Once it was completed, zero BER was real-
ized. Furthermore, the PPS timing difference was stable
and almost zero throughout the measurement.

Conversely, in Fig. 10(b), packet transmission errors were
signiﬁcantly induced. Especially some packets from
STA 2 were not recognized by BS in some of the time
regions. Furthermore, the time difference of PPS signals
is monotonically changing over time due to speciﬁc diffu-
sion mechanisms inherent in the oscillators. As examined
by the following, there are some different resultant man-
ners of data transfer in the desynchronized situation.

Fig. 11 summarizes the proper and improper operations
of STA 1 and STA 2 as a schematic diagram of a tim-
ing chart. First, Fig. 11(a) represents the proper situa-
tion where STA 1 and STA 2 are successfully synchro-
nized where the PPS signals denoted by vertical arrows
are completely time aligned. The time duration denoted
by horizontal arrows shows the AP duration. In this situa-
tion, STA 1 starts data transmission after the AP of STA 1,
indicated by the blue region. STA 2 also goes through the
AP durations after the time gap speciﬁed by AP offset.
STA 2 senses carriers in its AP durations, and STA 2 post-
pones data transmission, leading to no collision.

Conversely, in Fig. 11(b), STA 1 and STA 2 become asyn-
chronous where the PPS signal of STA 2 is earlier than
In this situation, AP for STA 1 and that for
STA 1.
STA 2 overlap, leading to simultaneous data transmis-
sion by both STAs. Therefore, collisions are induced. In
Fig. 10(b), the time regions marked by i and iv were such
situations.

Furthermore, Fig. 11(c) illustrates a situation when the
degree of synchronicity becomes more severe. The PPS
signal of STA 2 is way earlier than that of STA 1, which
allows STA 2 to send information. Consequently, STA 1
does not start data transmission. That is, the order is re-
versed. Such a situation is good in terms of avoiding data
transmission conﬂict. However, this is not the intended
order of the original design. In view of an increased num-
ber of terminals, such an unexpected out-of-order trans-
mission must be avoided to preserve the delay-bounded
property. In Fig. 10(b), such reversed situations happened
in the time regions ii and v.

Moreover, even under the proper situation in Fig. 11(a),
meaning that there are no collisions and no reverse order,
it should be emphasized that the BER was signiﬁcantly
high, as observed in the time region iii in Fig. 10(b). This

is because of the difference in frequencies of 10 MHz ref-
erence signals due to the asynchronicity among modules.
Transmitters and receivers generate 2.4 GHz signals from
those 10 MHz reference signals, and differences in fre-
quencies of reference signals cause the carrier frequency
offset. This induced errors in decoding received signals.

V Conclusion

This paper successfully experimentally demonstrates the
principles of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Arbi-
tration Point (CSMA/AP), which strictly ensures the up-
per bound of delay, based on software-deﬁned radio com-
bined with Wireless Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi) de-
vices. This study is the ﬁrst experimental demonstra-
tion of the arbitration of wireless communications us-
ing Wi-Wi. A star-topology network was constructed
using a 2.4 GHz band for data communications and a
920 MHz band for time synchronization of Wi-Wi. The

ing issues to be solved. For example, the packet rate is
determined directly by the PPS signal supplied by the Wi-
Wi module. The increased packet rate is an immediate
future technological target, which is also essential to ex-
ploit the capability of accommodating a massive amount
of terminals in CSMA/AP. Also, what is demonstrated in
this study is CSMA/AP-T. Another variant of CSMA/AP
is CSMA/AP-TS, where the inter-terminal distance infor-
mation is fully utilized. Its experimental examinations are
expected. Autonomous user addition and deletion will
be another fundamental issue. A variety of technical im-
provements, such as increased data rate and device inte-
gration, will be possible on the basis of recent advance-
ments in software-deﬁned radio and related technologies.

In summary, this study paves the way for future commu-
nications to beneﬁt from the precision time- and space-
synchronization for reliable information and communica-
tions.

A Carrier Sense and Arbitration

We used Algorithm 1 for carrier sense and arbitration.
There are two hyperparameters: N and a. N is the length
of queues irec and qrec recording accumulated in-phase
and quadrature signals, respectively, and a is the scale fac-
tor used when updating thresholds. We set N to 3 and a
to 5 during the mobility demonstration and N to 10 and
a to 2 during the other experiments. Here, i0 and q0 are
the direct-current components of in-phase and quadrature
signals, respectively; ithresh and qthresh are the thresholds
for accumulated in-phase and quadrature signals, respec-
tively; i(t) and q(t) are the in-phase and quadrature sig-
nals, respectively; ts and te are the starting and ending
time of an AP, respectively.

B Packet Contents

As mentioned in Section IV, each transmitted packet con-
sists of 500 kbits. The beginning 113 bits are the header
part, and the following 499 887 bits are the body part. Ta-
ble 1 is the contents of one packet.

(a) Indicated tim-
ing. APs are correctly positioned without overlapping,
and no collision occurs. (b) APs can overlap when PPS
signals arrive asynchronously at STA 1 and STA 2, and
STA 1 fails to detect transmissions from STA 2. In this
case, packets are simultaneously transmitted from STA 1
and STA 2, and collisions occur. (c) If PPS signals arrive
too earlier at STA 2 than STA 1, the transmission order
switches. In this case, collisions do not occur; however,
this switching can cause other collisions when there are
more APs in one cycle.

errors when the positions of the terminals were ﬁxed.
CSMA/AP was also successfully operated when the po-
sition of the terminal was dynamically reconﬁgured or on
mobile. Also, the comparison for desynchronized situa-
tions conﬁrmed the signiﬁcance of precise time synchro-
nization. The synchronization ability between Wi-Wi-
based devices and atomic clocks was also shown by exper-
imentally examining the Allan deviation to emphasize the
differences between the notion of frequency stability and
synchronization. There were several factors that affected
the performance of CSMA/AP. The most signiﬁcant factor
is time and frequency synchronization. This is the funda-
mental of CSMA/AP, and we deeply investigated its im-
pact with two experiments. Another factor is the reﬂection
of radio waves. The reﬂection of radio waves on the ﬂoor
disturbed the function of Wi-Wi modules, causing insufﬁ-
cient synchronization and distance measurement.

Whereas the fundamental principles of CSMA/AP are val-
idated in the present study, there are a variety of remain-
