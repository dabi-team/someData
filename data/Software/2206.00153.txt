Abstract

Planar kirigami metamaterials dramatically change their shape through a coordinated motion of nearly
rigid panels and ﬂexible slits. Here, we study a model system for mechanism-based planar kirigami featur-
ing periodic patterns of quadrilateral panels and rhombi slits, with the goal of predicting their engineering
scale response to a broad range of loads. We develop a generalized continuum model based on the kirigami’s
eﬀective (cell-averaged) deformation, along with its slit actuation and gradients thereof. The model ac-
counts for three sources of elasticity: a strong preference for the eﬀective ﬁelds to match those of a local
mechanism, inter-panel stresses arising from gradients in slit actuation, and distributed hinge bending. We
provide a ﬁnite element formulation of this model and implement it using the commercial software Abaqus.
Simulations of the model agree with experiments across designs and loading conditions.

1. Introduction

Mechanical metamaterials are solids whose global response is dominated by geometry and topology,
rather than material physics. A typical mechanical metamaterial, like the Miura-Origami [1] or the rotating-
squares lattice [2], is built from a pattern of repeating unit cells. Each cell is composed of stiﬀ and ﬂexible
elements, whose layout enables for a bulk shape-morphing response to stimuli. The geometric rules linking
design to deformation in such systems have captivated theorists [3–5]. In parallel, the embrace of shape-
morphing in modern engineering — for the design of stents [6, 7], soft robotic grippers [8, 9], deployable
space structures [10, 11], and the like — has drawn applied researchers to these systems in an eﬀort to
demonstrate new functionalities. Thus, mechanical metamaterials sit at the intersection of engineering
design and mechanics, where new paradigms are needed to realize their full potential.

This paper concerns one such paradigm, namely, how to best model the engineering scale response of
a shape-morphing mechanical metamaterial under a broad range of loads. To illustrate the challenges,
consider the example in Fig. 1. The pattern, a rotating-squares architecture, is composed of a repeating
unit cell of four quadrilateral panels, as shown in Fig. 1(a). This design exhibits a single mechanism [2],
which counter-rotates the panels periodically and results in an eﬀectively uniform overall motion in response
to homogeneous loads (Fig. 1(b)). However, when subjected to inhomogeneous loads (Fig. 1(c)), the slits
actuate in a non-uniform way — one that is locally mechanistic rather than globally so — reﬂecting the
interaction between the design of the unit cell and the choice of applied loads.

At the heart of this response lies a complex interplay between geometry and elasticity. Two modeling
approaches are common in the literature, the ﬁrst of which is purely geometric: panels are taken to be
rigid and connected by ideal hinges (folds, in origami), with the goal of characterizing rigid deformations

and mechanism motions using kinematic compatibility. This approach, ﬁrst popularized in the origami
literature [12–14], has rationalized the design of mechanical metamaterials and illuminated their basic
mechanisms [15–22]. However, it does not include elasticity.

The second modeling approach is based on long-established structural mechanics ideas [23, 24] exem-
pliﬁed in recent literature by the bar-hinge method [25, 26] and related spring methods [27, 28]. This
approach replaces the metamaterial with assemblies of bars and hinges, whose geometric arrangement en-
codes desired morphing attributes. Elasticity is accounted for by modeling bars/hinges as linear/torsional
springs, and the structure’s response is analyzed using standard numerical methods. While this approach
is versatile and convenient for systems composed of a small number of building blocks, it can become
computationally expensive for larger systems with many unit cells. Additionally, ﬁtting spring stiﬀnesses
to yield accurate global behaviors can be challenging.

Recently, a third approach has emerged from the idea of ﬁnding eﬀective, coarse-grained models for
the deformations of origami and kirigami [29–35]. In this approach, the metamaterial is modeled as an
eﬀectively continuum object, with the aim of capturing the collective response of its cells through averaging.
Supporting this idea is the heuristic that origami and kirigami have many soft modes, as in Fig. 1(c), that
resemble mechanisms locally but describe global, non-mechanistic shape change. Focusing on kirigami, we
highlight the works [28, 32, 34], which are closest to what we do here. The works of Czajkowski et al. and
McMahan et al. embrace the soft modes heuristic by introducing elastic models whose stresses drive the
kirigami’s eﬀective deformations towards cell-averaged local mechanisms. These models account for the
geometric nonlinearity inherent to soft modes. However, they are based solely on deformations, and miss
the fact that some sources of elastic frustration in kirigami arise instead from “micro”-incompatibilities.

To illustrate this point, consider the “domain wall” drawn in Fig. 2, which we base on an experiment in
Ref. [28]. An initially open rotating-squares specimen (Fig. 2(a)) has two symmetry-related slit actuations
that result in the same cell-averaged deformation, the “red” and “blue” phases in Fig. 2(b-c). Forcing
opposite phases to coexist leads to elastic frustration and to the appearance of a domain wall motif
familiar from other materials applications [36–38]. This frustration is due to the microscale incompatibility
of the two phases, which are nevertheless macroscopically compatible from the viewpoint of their eﬀective
deformations (both phases achieve the same overall shape change in Fig. 2(c)). Thus, domain walls cannot
be captured with a model based only on cell-averaged deformations. The ﬁx is to introduce an angle
into the model that distinguishes between the two slit-actuations of the incompatible phases. In this way,
Deng et al. predict a one-dimensional proﬁle for the slit actuation across the wall, for suﬃciently small
displacements allowing the two-dimensional character of the wall to be neglected. We embrace the key
insight of including the actuation, and incorporate it here into a nonlinear model.

Elastic continuum models with additional ﬁelds are known as generalized elastic continua. Such models
were ﬁrst proposed by the Cosserat brothers in the late 1800s, and later codiﬁed in great detail in the works
of Eringen ([39] and references therein). Popular incarnations include micropolar and micromorophic elas-
ticity; in general, a microcontinuum model strives to use auxilliary continuum ﬁelds to capture mechanical
rearrangements at the microscale with consequences for elasticity at larger scales. For this reason, perhaps,
recent research on metamaterials has made connections to this classical subject [40–42]. Nevertheless, the
most familiar microcontinuum models do not appear to apply broadly to mechanical metamaterials, whose
micro-motions are generally nonlinear.

This paper presents a generalized elastic continuum model for planar kirigami, which correctly accounts
for the geometric nonlinearities of the kirigami’s soft modes. For concreteness and simplicity, we focus on
a model system for planar kirigami, termed rhombi-slit krigami as it features periodic patterns of quad
panels and rhombi slits. All such patterns exhibit a periodic mechanism fully parameterized by a quantity
we call the slit actuation. A key question is how to link the micro-motions of the panels in a soft mode
to the macro-scale shape change, modeled through the eﬀective deformation. Our work [43, 44] answers
this question by deriving a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) to capture the geometry of locally
mechanistic motions. Here, we use this PDE to deﬁne a bulk elastic energy that vanishes on its solutions,
yielding an eﬀective stress that vanishes on soft modes. We also include two higher order sources of
elasticity of physical origin [27, 32, 43], which we model using the slit actuation ﬁeld: its gradient accounts
for deviations from a pure mechanism, while its value accounts for hinge bending. Altogether, these three
terms furnish a generalized elastic continuum model for rhombi-slit krigami in the plane.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the geometry of rhombi-slit kirigami
and parameterizes their mechanisms. Section 3 introduces our generalized elastic continuum model. Sec-
tion 4 derives its equilibrium equations and provides a ﬁnite element formulation. Section 5 compares
simulations of the model to experiments across designs and loading conditions. Section 6 ends with our
concluding remarks.

2. Kirigami patterns and their mechanisms

To introduce the design and kinematic variables of our model, we ﬁrst treat the kirigami’s simplest

modes of deformation: its pure mechanisms.

2.1. Rhombi-slit kirigami designs

We consider planar kirigami metamaterials consisting of a periodic array of unit cells, each having four
quadrilateral panels and four rhombi-slits, as in Fig. 3(a). In such designs, the four panels of the cell have
identical shape and are mirrors of each other across the slit-axes. We use edge lengths a, b, and c and two
sector angles θab and θac to describe the shape of the quadrilateral panels. We also denote by ξ0 the half
opening angle of the central slit of the cell in its reference conﬁguration. These six parameters are sketched
in Fig. 3(a) and fully parameterize the unit cell, up to a rigid motion. This family of metamaterials has a
large design space: it includes the well-known rotating-squares patterns (a = b = c, θab = θac = π/2) in its
closed state (ξ0 = 0) or open state (ξ0 = π/4).

panels and four rhombi-slits. (a) Reference conﬁguration, with detail of a unit cell and its characteristic dimensions. Panels
have side lengths a, b, c and internal angles θab and θac. The central slit has an initial opening angle 2ξ0. (b,c) Instances of the
pure mechanism motion of the metamaterial in (a). During the mechanism motion, the unit cell represented by Bravais lattice
vectors s0 and t0 in (a) is stretched and rotated, according to the stretch tensor A(ξ), where 2ξ is the change of opening angle
of the central slit. Correspondingly, the lattice vectors deform to s(ξ) and t(ξ).

2.2. Eﬀective description of kirigami mechanisms

Each rhombi-slit kirigami possesses a single degree-of-freedom planar mechanism. We now recall the

relevant results from [43], which link the kirigami’s eﬀective deformation to its slit actuation.

Let e1 and e2 denote the standard 2D Cartesian basis. The vectors s0 and t0 in Fig. 3(a) are Bravais
lattice vectors reﬂecting the periodicity of the pattern in its reference conﬁguration. They can be written
explicitly in terms of the cell parameters as

s0 = 2(a cos ξ0 + b cos (π − θab − ξ0))e1,
t0 = 2(a sin ξ0 + c cos (π/2 − θac + ξ0))e2.

(1)

Now replace ξ0 by ξ0 + ξ and observe from Fig. 3(b,c) that this change results in a deformed conﬁguration
of the pattern, where the central slit of each cell opens by an angle 2ξ and the panels counter-rotate to
accommodate this actuation. In other words, slit actuation by ξ parameterizes a mechanism deformation
of the pattern. As shown, the deformed conﬁguration has the Bravais lattice vectors

s(ξ) = 2(a cos (ξ0 + ξ) + b cos (π − θab − ξ0 − ξ))e1,
t(ξ) = 2(a sin (ξ0 + ξ) + c cos (π/2 − θac + ξ0 + ξ))e2.

(2)

To track the shape-change associated to this mechanism, we introduced a shape tensor A(ξ) in Ref. [43].
This 2 × 2 tensor is deﬁned as the unique linear transformation taking the reference Bravais lattice vectors
to their deformed counterparts. It is determined as a function of the slit actuation ξ via

s(ξ) = A(ξ)s0,

t(ξ) = A(ξ)t0.

(3)

4

The explicit formula for A(ξ) in the case of rhombi-slit kirigami is

A(ξ) = (cos ξ − α sin ξ)e1 ⊗ e1 + (cos ξ + β sin ξ)e2 ⊗ e2,

α =

a sin ξ0 − b sin (θab + ξ0)
a cos ξ0 − b cos (θab + ξ0)

,

β =

−c cos (θac − ξ0) + a cos ξ0
c sin (θac − ξ0) + a sin ξ0

.

(4)

Likewise, to coarse-grain the panel motions we introduced a 2D eﬀective deformation yeﬀ(x) per the
Cauchy-Born rule [43]. Since all cells deform identically in a mechanism, the associated yeﬀ(x) is homoge-
neous. Its 2 × 2 deformation gradient Feﬀ is constant, and is parameterized by the shape tensor up to a
rigid rotation. We showed that

(pure mechanism:)

(Feﬀ)T Feﬀ = A2(ξ)

(5)

thereby quantifying the link between the eﬀective deformation of a mechanism and its slit actuation, ξ.
By varying ξ, one obtains a compact description of the eﬀective shape change.

Finding the shape tensor of a periodic mechanical metamaterial is a general way of linking its micro-
scale motion to its macro-scale deformations, which we have just demonstrated for the pure mechanisms of
rhombi-slit kirigami. The same approach applies to the more general family of parallelogram-slit kirigami,
and goes beyond its mechanisms to capture its soft modes [43]. Certain generalized Miura-Ori origami
patterns have been similarly coarse-grained in [33, 35]. We focus on the class of rhombi-slit kirigami here
because we think it strikes a balance between breadth and simplicity.
Its simplicity is reﬂected in the
fact that its shape tensor is diagonal (Eq. (4)), reﬂecting a locally bi-axial shape change. Its breadth will
become clearer as we go on to describe a model for predicting the wealth of non-homogeneous soft modes.

3. A generalized continuum model for planar kirigami

We now present a constitutive model for the elasticity of rhombi-slit kirigami, based on the eﬀective
description of its mechanisms recalled in the previous section. As noted in the introduction, the basic
experimental observation is that for a large class of loading conditions, the kirigami exhibits a soft response
that cannot be captured by any single mechanism. Instead, its cells deform by an approximately locally
mechanistic response, with an actuation that varies slowly from cell to cell, and with panel deformations
that appear to oscillate about some smooth continuum deformation. We therefore build a generalized
continuum model to predict the deformation and its underlying actuation.

3.1. Statement of the model

For a rhombi-slit kirigami ﬁlling a 2D reference domain Ω, let yeﬀ : Ω → R2 denote its eﬀective defor-
mation and ξ : Ω → R its slit actuation, both of which we understand as continuum ﬁelds. Building oﬀ
of Eq. (5), our general idea is to choose an energy whose leading order behavior prefers approximate local
mechanisms. That is, we will require the model to produce the response

(approximately locally mechanistic:)

(cid:0)∇yeﬀ(x)(cid:1)T ∇yeﬀ(x) ≈ A2(ξ(x)).

(6)

The pattern’s slit actuation ξ will be treated as an auxiliary ﬁeld variable governed by higher-order sources
of elasticity in addition to this leading order constraint.

Proceeding to details, we assume that the ﬁelds (yeﬀ, ξ) describing the kirigami’s response to loads are

(local) minimizers of the potential energy function

E(yeﬀ, ξ) =

where tR denotes a prescribed “reference” traction on the boundary component ∂tΩ ⊂ ∂Ω, and yb pre-
scribes the deformation on the rest of the boundary. We use the strain energy density

Its ﬁrst term, W0, takes the form of a standard istropic 2D hyperelastic model

W (F, θ, p) = c0W0(FA−1(θ)) + c1θ2 + c2|p|2.

up to the decomposition G = FA−1(θ). Here A(θ) is the shape tensor, encoding the geometry of the
reference pattern from Section 2.1; it is invertible for any physical value of slit actuation. Note JG = det G
for short. Finally, the parameters c0, c1, c2 are elastic moduli which we anticipate ﬁtting to experiments.

3.2. Physical origin of the model

Using Fig. 4 as a guide, we now discuss the physical origin of the three terms in the energy density. Each
term is a distinct and natural consequence of the disparity of lengthscales in the pattern. As sketched in
Fig. 4(a), (c,d) and (e,f), L is the sample lengthscale, (cid:96) the unit cell lengthscale, and δ the hinge lengthscale.
Though our model can be generally applied, it is most relevant when δ (cid:28) (cid:96) (cid:28) L, i.e., when the number
of unit cells in the sample is large, and the hinges are small as compared to the panels. We make this
assumption throughout.

conﬁguration, indicating the sample lengthscale L. (b) Same pattern, subjected to heterogeneous loading. (c,d) Zoom-in on
slightly deformed and signiﬁcantly deformed regions of the specimen, through a window of dimensions comparable to the unit
cell lengthscale (cid:96). (e,f) Zoom-in on the hinges, indicating the hinge lengthscale δ.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (8), W0, arises as follows. Suppose we focus solely on regions of length ∼ (cid:96) under
typical loading, like those in Fig. 4(c,d). The local response is then nearly indistinguishable from that of
a pure mechanism; the heterogeneity, as seen in Fig. 4(b), only emerges at a much larger scale. Because
of this feature, we choose W0 to be a bulk elastic energy that is minimized and zero whenever (yeﬀ, ξ)
coincide with a coarse-grained local mechanism,

(locally mechanistic:)

(cid:0)∇yeﬀ(x)(cid:1)T ∇yeﬀ(x) = A2(ξ(x)).

(10)

Choosing W0 as such allows us to introduce stress proportional to the modulus c0 to penalize deviations
from local mechanisms. This stress should be signiﬁcant. In fact, as was described in the supplementary

6

material of our previous work [43], a coarse-grained kirigami deformation that fails to be locally mechanistic
is accompanied by distortions of the panels and hinges comparable to the characteristic length of the panels
(∼ (cid:96)). As such, c0 should scale with the shear modulus µ of the material used to fabricate the kirigami
(possibly with some weak dependence on (cid:96)/L and δ/(cid:96)).

The other two terms in the energy density Eq. (8) account for higher order eﬀects related to localized
elastic distortions in and nearby the hinges. The second term (with modulus c1) is the simplest possible
model that approximates the bending energy of the hinges when slits open or close.
In the eﬀective
description, it depends only on the slit actuation ξ. This actuation counter-rotates the panels to yield
the bending, as shown in Fig. 4(d,f). Large actuation leads to large localized strains at lengthscales ∼ δ2
nearby the hinges. So, we expect that the modulus c1 scales ∼ µδ2/(cid:96)2.

The ﬁnal term in the energy density regularizes the actuation ﬁeld, and corresponds to the simplest

elastic model for resisting inhomogeneous actuation within a locally mechanistic response.
physical origins [27, 32], and is akin to the plate bending term from Ref. [34]. However, it directly depends
on the actuation in our model rather than indirectly through an eﬀective displacement ﬁeld (for the reasons
described in the introduction). The basic idea is that whenever the kirigami’s response deviates from a
pure mechanism, some elastic distortions are required around the hinges to preserve the connectivity of the
pattern. For a locally mechanistic deformation the needed stretch is small [43], but depends explicitly on
how the actuation varies from cell to cell; it is only zero when the pattern deforms as a pure mechanism.
In another work [45], we provide a detailed derivation of this so-called “mechanism-gradient” term and
show that the associated modulus c2 ∼ µ((cid:96)2/L2)(log(L/(cid:96)))−1. While the actual mechanism-gradient term
we obtain is quite complicated, we choose to model it here by a quadratic expression in ∇ξ to keep the
constitutive model as simple as possible, while ensuring that it has all the necessary sources of elasticity.

3.3. Eﬀective stress and eﬀectively stress-free conﬁgurations

Having written down an eﬀective model, we proceed to determine the eﬀective stress measures it
imposes, and derive and discuss some properties of eﬀectively stress-free conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst Piola-
Kirichhoﬀ stress P is obtained by diﬀerentiating the strain energy density W in F. From Eq. (8),

P(F, θ) = P0

We also introduce the so-called Kirchhoﬀ stress [46], as it will be useful later on for numerics. This stress
is deﬁned as

τ (F, θ) := P(F, θ)FT = P0(FA−1(θ))(cid:0)FA−1(θ)(cid:1)T = τ 0

In a traditional elastic continuum, the stress-free conﬁgurations are rigid body motions.

Indeed,
In contrast, our generalized continuum model has a much

richer family of eﬀectively stress-free conﬁgurations: for the ﬁelds (yeﬀ, ξ) on Ω,

τ (∇yeﬀ(x), ξ(x)) = 0 ⇔ (cid:0)∇yeﬀ(x)(cid:1)T ∇yeﬀ(x) = A2(ξ(x)).

(15)

The latter equation is the condition for a coarse-grained local mechanism discussed above (Eq. (10)). It
constrains the metric tensor (left Cauchy-Green tensor) of the eﬀective deformation yeﬀ in terms of the

7

slit actuation ﬁeld ξ, which reﬂects the fact that the eﬀective ﬁelds must vary in a coordinated way to
represent a locally mechanistic soft mode of rhombi-slit kirigami in the plane.

In our previous work [43], we showed that there are broad classes of deformations and slit actuations
that solve this metric constraint, and that these ﬁelds capture the behavior of soft deformations observed
experimentally. We also derived an important link between the metric constraint and the eﬀective Poisson’s
ratio of the pattern. We present a brief description of this link here, as it illuminates a fundamental
dichotomy in the qualitative features of the slit actuation in this model, and will help to clarify the choices
we make later on in the simulations and experiments.

Consider any eﬀectively stress-free conﬁguration (yeﬀ, ξ), i.e., one with τ = 0. Since the deformation is
planar, it trivially has zero Gauss curvature. As the Gauss curvature is fundamentally linked to its metric
tensor through Gauss’s remarkable theorem [47], we ﬁnd that the slit actuation solves a PDE of the form

(cid:104)
2 − (cid:0) µ1(ξ(x))
∂2

µ2(ξ(x))

(cid:1)2ν21(ξ(x))∂2

1

(cid:105)

ξ(x) = g(ξ(x), ∇ξ(x)),

(16)

for g(θ, p) a function whose explicit form is lengthy and not important for the discussion at hand. The
function ν21(θ), introduced in this PDE, turns out to be the eﬀective Possion’s ratio of the pattern [43]. It
satisﬁes

ν21(θ) =

(cos θ − α sin θ)
(sin θ + α cos θ)

(− sin θ + β cos θ)
(cos θ + β sin θ)

(17)

where α and β quantify the reference rhombi-slit cell via Eq. (4).

The PDE in Eq. (16) is second order and quasi-linear, which means that its so-called type has a standard
classiﬁcation from PDE theory [48]: the PDE is elliptic for solutions ξ that satisfy ν21(ξ(x)) < 0 on Ω, is
hyperbolic for solutions that satisfy ν21(ξ(x)) > 0 on Ω, and is of mixed type if the solution’s Poisson’s
ratio changes sign on some part of the domain. In other words, the PDE is elliptic if the unit cell is auxetic
and hyperbolic if it is non-auxetic.

These results have important modeling implications. In the typical setting, where c0 (cid:29) c1,2 in Eq. (8),
we expect a large family of “slightly stressed” equilibrium solutions of our model. Each such solution, then,
approximately solves the metric constraint, with a ξ ﬁeld that closely resembles one obeying the PDE in
Eq. (16). Given this observation, we identify rhombi-slit kirigami as elliptic or hyperbolic based on the sign
of its eﬀective Poisson’s ratio at equilibrium. We expect this identiﬁcation to indicate certain qualitative
properties of the kirigami’s response to loads: elliptic kirigami with auxetic cells should exhibit a decay
in slit actuation away from the boundary loads. In contrast, hyperbolic kirigami with non-auxetic cells
should exhibit comparatively persistent slit actuation under the same loading conditions. We highlight
this dichotomy in further detail with the examples to come.

4. Equilibrium equations and ﬁnite element formulation

Next, we derive the equilibrium equations and natural boundary conditions of our model. The equi-
librium equations are a coupled PDE system that includes the familiar divergence-free condition on the
eﬀective stress, as well as an auxiliary PDE enforcing equilibrium for the slit actuation. We ﬁnish this
section with an FEM formulation of the model, and discuss its implementation in Abaqus.

4.1. Derivation of equilibrium equations

We ﬁrst derive the equilibrium equations. Let (yeﬀ, ξ) be a local minimizer to the potential energy in

Eq. (7). Then, by taking the ﬁrst variation of the energy functional,

denote the partial derivatives of W (F, θ, p) with respect to θ and p. Observe that
Wθ(F, θ, p) = −P0(FA−1(θ)) : (cid:0)FA−1(θ)A(cid:48)(θ)A−1(θ)(cid:1) + 2c1θ

We show below that fact(F, θ) provides a driving force for heterogeneous actuation within the model.

We substitute these formulas into Eq. (18), let Pyeﬀ,ξ(x) := P(∇yeﬀ(x), ξ(x)) and apply the divergence

4.2. Finite element formulation

To solve these equations, we use the ﬁnite element method (FEM). Eqs. (20-21) give the strong form of
the boundary value problem for the eﬀective deformation yeﬀ and slit actuation ﬁeld ξ. FEM formulations
are instead based on the weak form, in Eq. (18). Using Eq. (19), we can conveniently rewrite the weak
form as

organizational purposes, we list all the nodal values uA and ξA as arrays u and ξ.

We substitute Eq. (23) into Eq. (22) and use that each ηA is arbitrary and each wA is arbitrary for

In practice, we do not solve for the arrays (u, ξ) by making the residuals vanish. Instead, a Newton-

in an eﬀort to make the residuals suﬃciently small. The solver in Abaqus takes as input explicit functions

Explicit formulas for these tangents are in Appendix A.

Eq. (25) and the formulas for Eq. (27) are integrals calculated numerically using Gaussian quadrature.
The formulas for the shape functions, Gaussian quadrature, and the surface traction term are all standard,
and not discussed here. We implement this FEM formulation into Abaqus using a user-element subroutine
(UEL) [49]. The UEL is called for each element for each iteration. The initial nodal coordinates and current
nodal variables (u, ξ) are input. The nodal residuals in Eq. (25) and tangents in Eq. (27) are output. The
UEL can be used for linear/quadratic and triangular/quadrilateral elements.

5. Experiments and simulations

To validate our model, we compare its predictions with experiments for two designs, namely, the auxetic
rotating-squares sample and another that is strictly non-auxetic and is described just below. We deﬁne the
geometry of the samples, including hinge regions, and explain how to extract a representative rhombi-slit
cell for each design to facilitate a reasonable comparison between model and experiment. We study the
simple example of uniform stretch, and then turn to complex examples involving heterogeneous loads.

10

5.1. Experimental samples and their idealized unit cells

Fig. 5(a,b) shows the two specimens used in our work. One is a classical rotating-squares pattern. The
other — which we term as a “hyperbolic pattern” for reasons explained below — features two alternating
slits with the same width in the horizontal direction and diﬀerent height. Fig. 5(c,d) shows portions of the
patterns that were used for laser cutting; the fabricated samples include hinge regions designed to be of
length d = (cid:96)/20 and height h = (cid:96)/80, as shown. The actual hinge dimensions vary from the designed ones
due to variability associated with laser cutting rubber.

Fig. 5. From fabricated patterns to idealized rhombi-slit cells. (a) Rotating-squares sample (elliptic). (b) Non-auxetic sample
(hyperbolic). (c,d) Portions of the patterns fed to the laser cutter to fabricate specimens (a) and (b). To avoid issues during
cutting, hinges are shaped as rectangular blocks. We highlight idealized unit cells in red and report their dimensions.

To convert the two cut pattern designs into idealized rhombi-slit designs, we treat the centroid of
each hinge as a corner point. Tracing out the lines connecting neighboring corner points leads to a
desired rhombi-slit pattern. We use these “traced” rhombi-slit cells as inputs to the simulations. The
parameters for both patterns are displayed in Fig. 5. Recalling Eq. (4), the rotating-squares pattern satisﬁes
(α, β) = (−0.9, 0.9), while the hyperbolic pattern satisﬁes (α, β) = (−0.9, 0). Substituting these parameters
into Eq. (17) for the cell’s eﬀective Poisson’s ratio gives

(Rotating-Squares:)

ν21(ξ) = −1,

(Hyperbolic Pattern:) ν21(ξ) =

(cid:16) − cos ξ + 0.9 sin ξ
−0.9 cos ξ + sin ξ

(cid:17)

tan ξ

|ξ|(cid:28)1

≈ 1.11ξ.

(28)

As discussed in Section 3.3, the Poisson’s ratio describes important qualitative features of each pattern’s
response, in addition to its auxeticity.

The rotating-squares pattern is auxetic and, more speciﬁcally, purely dilational, since the Poisson’s
ratio indicates equal principal strains independent of the slit actuation. It therefore belongs to the special

11

class of patterns known as conformal [32, 43], which is a subclass of the more general elliptic kirigami
discussed previously. We expect this pattern’s actuation to generally decay away from boundary loads. In
contrast, the hyperbolic pattern is non-auxetic, thus hyperbolic, for ξ ∈ (0, 0.23π). The sample is termed
hyperbolic because the slit actuation is always observed to be in the hyperbolic range for tension type
boundary conditions. (In contrast, compressing the sample can lead to buckling, which we do not discuss
here; see [34] for ideas in this direction.) Guided by its hyperbolicity, we expect this pattern’s actuation
to persist far away from boundary loads.

5.2. Uniform stretch

The simple loading condition of uniform stretch allows us to investigate the interplay between hinge
elasticity and the purely mechanistic response, both experimentally and in the elastic energy in Eq. (8). For
the demonstration, we focus on the auxetic rotating-squares example. Experimentally, similarly to what is
done in Ref. [50], we induce free transverse expansion under uniaxial loading by connecting the boundary
slits on the left and right edges of the specimen to a rod by means of hooks, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a).
This connection allows transverse motion at little resistance. The experimental results, comparing stretch
to slit actuation, are marked with circles in the ﬁgure.

The experimental pattern displays a mostly uniform actuation under this loading, especially in the
center of the sample as indicated. We therefore consider the elastic energy of the (α, β) = (−0.9, 0.9)
rotating-squares pattern under a homogeneous eﬀective deformation gradient ∇yeﬀ(x) = F(λ, λ2) = λe1 ⊗
e1 + λ2e2 ⊗ e2 and slit actuation ξ(x) = ξ. For a given stretch λ, equilibrium is achieved by minimizing
W (F(λ, λ2), ξ, 0) with respect to λ2 and ξ. Setting w(λ, ξ) := minλ2 W (F(λ, λ2), ξ, 0), the slit actuation at
equilibrium is

ξ(λ) = arg min

ξ

(cid:8)w(λ, ξ)(cid:9).

(29)

The actuation depends implicitly on the ratio c1/c0, reﬂecting the relative inﬂuence of bulk and hinge
elasticity in the model.

Fig. 6. Uniform stretch of the rotating-squares sample. (a) Color maps of the slit actuation, determined by the method
described in Appendix B. L is the undeformed sample length. (b) Slit actuation ξ plotted as a function of horizontal stretch
λ. Solid lines display the model results with varying c1/c0.

In Fig. 6(b), we plot (λ, 2ξ(λ)) for c1/c0 = 0, 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3. The bulk elastic term dominates
at small values of stretch, since the plot is essentially independent of c1/c0 in this regime. As the stretch
increases, hinge elasticity becomes more pronounced; the curve shows a particularly strong dependence
on c1/c0 in the large stretch regime (λ > 1.2). We note, generally, that the slit actuation decreases

12

monotonically as a function of increasing c1/c0, and hinge elasticity cannot be ignored at large values of
stretch for this sample. Also, the ratio c1/c0 = 10−2 provides a good ﬁt to our experimental data. We use
c1/c0 = 10−2 from here on when comparing the deformed rotating-squares sample to analogous simulations.

5.3. Heterogeneous loading

We turn now to a comparison between FEM simulations of the model and experiments under complex
loading conditions. We perform the FEM simulations in Abaqus/Standard using the UEL subroutine
developed in Section 4.2: a 2D square domain non-dimensionalized to have unit length is meshed by
1600 (8 node quadratic quadrilateral) user elements and is subjected to various displacement boundary
conditions. The model has three moduli c0, c1, c2 which need to be supplied for the two samples, along
with the cell parameters α and β from Fig. 5. We normalize the elasticity by c0; this choice inﬂuences the
overall magnitude of the stresses, but not the predicted deformation. (Generally, c0 can be determined by
an experimental force-displacement curve. We do not report its value here, since friction makes it diﬃcult
to accurately measure such curves for large, soft kirigami samples.) Lastly, we ﬁt the ratios c1/c0 and c2/c0
so as to accurately capture the response of a broad range of experiments. For simplicity, the ﬁt is done by
trial and error for a variety of boundary conditions. Each simulation typically takes less than minute on a
standard laptop, so this approach is not tedious or diﬃcult. In the following comparison, we use

(Rotating-Squares:)

(Hyperbolic Pattern:)

c1/c0 = 10−2,
c1/c0 = 3 × 10−2,

c2/c0 = 5 × 10−5,
c2/c0 = 10−4.

(30)

One should not extrapolate these values to other samples. We expect c1/c0 and c2/c0 to vary for patterns
fabricated with a diﬀerent number of cells or hinge-panel dimensions, even if the unit cell geometry and

underlying material are otherwise the same. As discussed in Section 3.1, basic physical reasoning suggests
c1/c0 scales as ∼ δ2/(cid:96)2 and c2/c0 as ∼ (cid:96)2/L2 [27, 32, 43] (up to a log factor [45]).

With Figs. 7-8, we demonstrate numerical simulations that accurately capture the heterogeneous engi-
neering scale response of the two kirigami patterns under complex boundary conditions. We consider, in
particular, three boundary conditions: pulling along diagonal line (Figs. 7-8(a)), pulling along centerline
(Figs. 7-8(b)), and pulling a center point with the opposite corner points ﬁxed (Figs. 7-8(c)). Each such
loading leads to a soft response in the two experimental patterns, far from any pure mechanism.

Some general features emerge from the experiments.

In the rotating-squares sample, slit actuation
quickly decays in arcs around the loading points. In the hyperbolic sample, slit actuation instead radiates
from the loaded boundary, yielding large bands of actuation within the sample’s bulk. This “decay versus
persistence” in actuation aﬃrms the link to Poisson’s ratio derived in Ref. [43] and discussed in Section
3.3 and Section 5.1. Our simulations capture these general features, as well as ﬁner details.

With the moduli parameters of the model given by Eq. (30), we carry out simulations by matching the
boundary conditions of the three experiments for each sample. (These boundary conditions include the
displacements where the sample is loaded, as well as the natural traction-free and ξ boundary conditions
in Eq. (21)). The simulations are shown on the bottom row of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, and each recovers the
pattern’s engineering scale response on the top row. As the ﬁgures highlight, the solved-for slit actuation
agrees qualitatively with that of the experiments. Table 1 also compares various metrics of the normed
diﬀerence in boundary displacement between the experimental and simulation results. The agreement is
quantitatively excellent. Each pattern is subject to roughly 10 − 30% engineering strain, yet the boundary
discrepancies are but a fraction of the length of a unit cell.

6. Conclusions

This paper modeled the class of rhombi-slit kirigami metamaterials as generalized elastic continua. We
ﬁrst described how to obtain the cell-averaged response of the pattern’s mechanism deformations. Then we
formulated an elastic energy that drove the pattern’s eﬀective deformation and slit actuation towards this
cell-averaged response locally, and treated the slit actuation as an auxiliary ﬁeld variable to account for
additional physically relevant sources of elasticity. Through implementation in Abaqus, we demonstrated a
model capable of predicting the response of kirigami metamaterials across designs and loading conditions.
Although we only discussed a speciﬁc energy formula for a speciﬁc family of kirigami, our method can
be generalized to a wide range of kirigami metamaterials. For instance, by modifying the shape tensor in
Eq. (4), we can model planar kirigami with parallelogram slits [43], and presumably any other periodic and
planar kirigami with periodic mechanisms to be discovered. We can also account for spatial variations of
unit cell design, as in Ref. [50], by allowing the design parameters in the model to vary. Finally, while our
constitutive choices in Eqs. (8-9) were simple by design, they can be easily updated to enrich the model
to account for more nuanced features of the kirigami’s response than those discussed here. It is worth
mentioning that our mechanical model is able to predict the force-displacement curves once the value of
c0 in Eq. (8) is assigned. We did not discuss applied forces in this paper due to the limitations (mainly
friction-related) of our current experimental setup.

Taking a broader view, our results suggest that modeling mechanical metamaterials as generalized
elastic continua is a powerful approach — one potentially capable of eﬃciently navigating the design space
of these materials, while remaining predictive under a wide range of loads. By focusing on rhombi-slit
kirigami, we took a purposefully concrete and simple approach to modeling. We hope this choice makes
our work widely accessible and paves the way for broad generalization going forward.

Appendix A. Explicit tangent formulas for Abaqus FEM implementation

Here, we develop explicit formulas for the tangents in Eq. (27) to complete the description of the FEM
formulation for Abaqus implementation. The formulas reference functions introduced in Sections 3 and

4 which we do not repeat here. The formulas also make use of shape functions deﬁned on the current

∇ ˜N A ◦ yeﬀ(x) = (cid:0) ˜F(x, u)(cid:1)−T ∇N A(x).

(A.1)

This transformation is a convenient way of bringing out certain symmetries in the parts of these tangents
associated to the bulk elastic term W0. (Chapter 8.4 [46] has a detailed exposition on hyperelastic tangent
formulas, where this transformation is employed.) In brief, we ﬁnd that

Appendix B. Materials and methods

We cut the kirigami specimens out of 1.5 mm-thick natural rubber sheets (McMaster-Carr 8633K71)
using an 80 Watt Epilog Fusion Pro 32 laser cutter. During the fabrication, the laser cutter is focused
on the bottom face of the rubber sheet to avoid burning the specimens and to produce clean cuts. The
specimens are painted with white primer paint to create high contrast with a black background, which
facilitates image processing. Images of the samples are recorded by means of a FLIR 5-megapixel 35 fps
camera with Edmund Optics lenses.

16

Our method for characterizing the actuation in the deformed experimental samples is similar to our
previous work [43] and to that of others [28]. We obtain quantitative information on the deformation
through digital image processing in MATLAB. After converting the images to binary (using the imbinarize
function), we obtain the centroid c(i,j), semi-major axis a(i,j), and semi-minor axis b(i,j) of the central slit
of each (i, j)-cell using the regionprops function. Then, using d = (cid:96)/20 from Section 5.1 and ξ0 from
Fig. 5(c-d), we calculate ξ(i,j) from tan(ξ(i,j) + ξ0) = (|a(i,j)| + d/2)/(|b(i,j)| + d/2) and take γ(i,j) as the
inclination of the major axis with respect to the horizontal. Since we know the dimensions of the panels in
the sample, we overlay a ξ color map of each idealized deformed unit cell (with angles (ξ(i,j),γ(i,j))) onto
the experimental pattern, centered at the slit centroid c(i,j).
