ABSTRACT
User forums of Open Source Software (OSS) enable end-users to
collaboratively discuss problems concerning the OSS applications.
Despite decades of research on OSS, we know very little about
how end-users engage with OSS communities on these forums, in
particular, the challenges that hinder their continuous and meaning-
ful participation in the OSS community. Many previous works are
developer-centric and overlook the importance of end-user forums.
As a result, end-users’ expectations are seldom reflected in OSS
development. To better understand user behaviors in OSS user fo-
rums, we carried out an empirical study analyzing about 1.3 million
posts from user forums of four popular OSS applications: Zotero,
Audacity, VLC, and RStudio. Through analyzing the contribution
patterns of three common user types (end-users, developers, and
organizers), we observed that end-users not only initiated most of
the threads (above 96% of threads in three projects, 86% in the other),
but also acted as the significant contributors for responding to other
users’ posts, even though they tended to lack confidence in their
activities as indicated by psycho-linguistic analyses. Moreover, we
found end-users more open, reflecting a more positive emotion in
communication than organizers and developers in the forums. Our
work contributes new knowledge about end-users’ activities and
behaviors in OSS user forums that the vital OSS stakeholders can
leverage to improve end-user engagement in the OSS development
process.

1 INTRODUCTION
The impact of Open Source Software (OSS) is increasing rapidly. As
OSS grow, they amass an increasingly large and diverse user base
in addition to a variety of applications across different domains,
such as scientific computing, programming, media editing, and
content management. Successful development and maintenance of
OSS involves frequent and direct communication among different
stakeholders, such as developers, maintainers, project owners, con-
tributors, designers, and end-users, to facilitate an understanding
of each stakeholder’s unique needs and challenges. These efforts ul-
timately serve as the main drive to build a thriving OSS community
with diverse groups engaging in the development and maintenance
process.

One such communication channel for OSS is the user forums
where the stakeholders of OSS may come to engage with the larger
community. In particular, end-users of an OSS rely on these user
forums to discuss usage issues, collaboratively find solutions to
their problems, request new features, and more. Despite forums’
longstanding use, we know very little about the practices and ac-
tivities of different stakeholders in these user forums, particularly
what challenges prevent end-users from engaging frequently and
meaningfully with the OSS community.

Early research on OSS development is primarily concerned with
the stakeholders who participate in the code contribution of the
projects. The investigations related to forums were limited to devel-
oper forums and tasks mostly concerning developers and organizers
of OSS, such as new developers’ on-boarding [8], contributors so-
cial network [29], discussion instrumentation [37], and engaging
organizers to OSS [18]. A handful of studies on end-users only
focused on certain behavior of the power users, such as bug report-
ing [16]. The communication with the mass end-users, however,
has largely been ignored in previous OSS studies. By analyzing the

end-users’ activities and communication behaviors with developers,
organizers and other users in forums, we can find insights into their
actions, opinions, and mental and emotional states when using and
discussing the OSS. These insights are prerequisites to support the
efforts of OSS communities to improve the usability [38] and acces-
sibility of the software [10], as well as the sustainability of the OSS
communities themselves [2].

In this work, we aim to characterize the current landscape of OSS
end-user forums to identify the challenges and opportunities for
end-user engagement and community building. Towards this end,
we carried out an empirical study on user forums of four popular
OSS applications: Zotero, Audacity, VLC, and RStudio. We analyzed
a total of about 1.3 million posts created by more than 200,000
participating members in those four user forums. Our analysis
sought to answer the following research questions:

RQ1: What are the characteristics (e.g., length, duration, response
time) of the discussion threads in OSS user forums?
RQ2: How do different roles participate in the OSS user forums,

including end-users, developers, and organizers?

RQ2.1: How frequently does each role perform different ac-

tivities related to the discussion threads?

RQ2.2: How do the content of their posts differ in terms of lin-
guistic features that capture their cognitive processes,
emotions, motivation, and power dynamics?

To answer these research questions, we analyzed the forum posts
separated by the categories of forum users’ roles and the types of
activities these forum users performed. In particular, we focused on
the frequency as well as the breadth of interactions among users
within the forums (e.g., response time and user tenure). Moreover,
we conducted psycho-linguistic analyses on the forum contents to
understand the emotional and mental states of interactions among
users (e.g., level of confidence, cognitive states) in OSS forums.

Results revealed that organizers, developers, and end-users con-
tributed to three types of activities (i.e., first post to initiate a thread,
reply from other users, and reply from an original poster) in OSS
user forums with distinct patterns. As expected, end-users sub-
stantially contributed to the OSS forums by initiating discussions.
End-users also actively participated in conversations, in addition
to organizers and developers, by responding to other users’ posts.
Although end-users generally lacked confidence in their commu-
nication compared to the other two roles, our results indicate the
presence of a large pool of active and open-minded end-users who
can contribute to improving the usability of OSS by providing rele-
vant feedback.

Overall, this study provides three main contributions. First, we
contribute a novel set of characteristics which reveal that besides
discussing problems concerning OSS applications, end-users of OSS
make significant contributions to the OSS community by providing
feedback to other users. Second, we show that despite OSS end-
users having fairly neutral tones when conversing, they bring a
more positive attitude and openness to the user forums when com-
pared to the organizers and developers, even though the end-users
exhibit a lack of confidence while interacting. Third, we present an
empirical evidence-based characterization of user behaviors in OSS
user forums that can be leveraged to increase end-user engagement

and collaboration in the OSS community and eventually contribute
to OSS improvement.

2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
2.1 OSS Usability and Forums
Past research has established that in OSS, end-users discuss their
issues in an ad-hoc manner on forums, when they are present, or in
a repository’s issue tracking system such as on GitHub [5, 34, 37].
Cheng and Guo [5] found that usability specific issue threads are
lengthy and contain over-generalized assumptions, where usability
refers to attributes which determine ease, error-prevention, effi-
ciency, and pleasantness for an end-user when interacting with a
software [5, 22]. Wang et al. [38] advocated for the need for a user-
centric and inclusive mindset amongst OSS practitioners. Hellman
et al. [9] identified inclusiveness and learnability of issue track-
ing as barriers for non-technical OSS end-users to collaborate on
a project in addition to OSS designers and developers struggling
to manage multiple sources for end-user engagement. Most prior
work on OSS forums and discussions has focused on developer
forums, discussions, or mailing lists but not the end-user specific
forums [4, 19, 31, 35].

2.2 Forums and Text Analysis
Prior efforts have been made to establish taxonomies for online
communications so that automatic classifiers may aid efforts in
these communications [12, 15, 19, 24, 25]. Ivanovic [11] established
a taxonomy to model and detect dialogue acts (i.e., statement, thank-
ing, open-answer, etc.) in instant messaging. Specifically in regards
to online forums, Zhang et al. [41] propose a taxonomy for user
intents in online health forums and Zhang et al. [40] characterized
online discussion comments into discourse acts (e.g., question, an-
swer, announcement, etc.). Software requirements extraction efforts
have attempted to leverage online forums and discussions from
users. Stade et al. [32] built an end-user forum for requirements
extraction, but found a forum alone is insufficient, while Kanchev
et al. [14] used high-level query language to automatically extract
requirements from online discussions. In regards to technical OSS
forums, prior efforts have explored methods to understand forums
and its users. Nugroho et al. [23] investigated project-specific fo-
rum threads in the Eclipse ecosystem to understand participation,
content, and sentiment. Wang et al. [36] explored ways to improve
incentive systems for fast answers in technical Q&A websites.

2.3 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
One established text analysis method is the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) tool which uses word counting methods for an-
alyzing the psychological meaning through specific categories (e.g.,
articles, positive emotions, power, etc.) of words present in dialogue
and texts [27, 33]. LIWC utilizes an extensive dictionary, which has
seen multiple developments, with the latest version, LIWC2015,
consisting of about 90 categories with almost 6,400 words, word
stems, and select emoticons in addition to its processing component
[27, 33]. The LIWC application takes a text input (of any length) and
for each word in the text, a comparison is made to the dictionary.
When a word is present in the dictionary, the category containing

Characterizing User Behaviors in Open-Source Software User Forums: An Empirical Study

CHASE’22 , May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

the word is incremented (some words may belong to multiple cate-
gories) and a value is calculated for each category to represent the
percentage of the total original text [33].

In practice, LIWC has been applied to various fields to understand
relationships between psychological meaning and language used
to communicate. While extensive research has validated LIWC’s
accuracy in a variety of domains, LIWC is constantly improv-
ing and it remains that accuracy will vary by specific tasks and
datasets [1, 27, 33]. Some previous studies that used LIWC include:
predicting relationship conflict interactions [3], understanding help-
seeking behavior on social media [17], measuring linguistic style
accommodation on social media [7], and examining emotions of
different forum participants in mental distress on discussion fo-
rums [39]. Specifically in the context of OSS, LIWC has successfully
been utilized to examine types of developer personalities to under-
stand markers of release success, the likelihood to become project
contributors, and the implications of inferring personality from
psycho-linguistic methods [4, 31, 35]. For our purpose of under-
standing the communication patterns in OSS user forums, we are
applying LIWC to extract meaningful psycho-linguistic characteris-
tics in OSS forum posts. Section 3.3.3 details our category selection
and methodology for inspection.

3 METHODS
3.1 OSS Projects Selection
To answer our research questions, we scope the projects under
investigation with three criteria. First, each project needs have an
active user forum. The primary goal of our study was to investi-
gate how end-users participate in discussions and what facilitates
or challenges them in the existing platform. User forums are the
primary channel to enable end-users to communicate with other
community members. Second, the OSS should have a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). We chose OSS with a GUI because their user base
is normally more diverse in terms of programming backgrounds.
The gap between the end-users and developers can potentially im-
pact how they communicate problems related to the software. An
analysis on these projects is especially informative and important
towards OSS usability and inclusiveness. Last, the project manages
their code base on GitHub. We would be able to identify the contrib-
utors of each project and cross-reference if they possess any role in
the user forum. Following those criteria, we selected four popular
OSS projects for analyses: Zotero, Audacity, VLC, and RStudio:
• Zotero (www.zotero.org) is a popular reference management
software that helps users collect, maintain, and cite reference ma-
terials. Zotero provides a basic forum1 for the users to post their
questions or comment on other forum users’ posts. All threads
other than the announcements from the administrators are ordered
chronologically with the latest on top. Forum users can also use
the search button to initialize a query based search on the existing
posts.
• Audacity (www.audacityteam.org) is a multi-track audio recorder
and editing application. The user forum for Audacity2 is divided
into several modules, including ‘audacity help forum’, ‘feedback
and discussion forum’, ‘special interest group’, and ‘programming

and development’; each module is further split into sub-forums for
concrete topics.The users can search the forum with textual queries
or browse the unanswered topics through quick links.
• VLC (www.videolan.org) is a cross-platform multimedia player
that supports various media formats and can be used as a streaming
server. The design of VLC user forum3 greatly resembles Audacity
with only a slight difference in some of the concrete sub-forums.
• RStudio (www.rstudio.com) is an Integrated Development En-
vironment, specially designed to facilitate R programming. It is
frequently used for data science and scientific research. The design
of the RStudio user forum4 is a combination of the design of the
other forums discussed above. All threads are listed chronologically
with pinned threads on top. Each thread can be assigned to one
category and one or more tags to enable the forum users to search
and browse them with such meta-data. This user forum also inte-
grates additional functions to support engagement, such as the like
buttons for each posts and new topics recommendations.

3.2 Data Collection
We first extracted the threads of posts from each forum using
Scrapy5. The range of posts collected is from the inception of re-
spective forums till October, 2021. Concretely, we extract the textual
content of each post, the topic it belongs to, poster authors’ user
names and user type, and the timestamp of the post. Table 1 presents
an overview of the forum data we collected during this step. Overall,
we compiled a total of 282,946 threads from the four OSS forums.
These thread included over 1.29 million posts made by 207,654 mem-
bers. These four forums represent various forum sizes and activity
levels. Among them, VLC had the highest number of members
(𝑁 = 94, 210), while RStudio had the lowest (𝑁 = 21, 790).

Using the GitHub API, we then collected the GitHub user name
for all the contributors for each OSS. Initial manual inspection
indicates that developers tended to use the same username in the
user forums as on GitHub. Therefore, by comparing the user names
on these two sites, we labeled each forum user if their role is likely
to be a developer.

3.3 Data Analysis
3.3.1 Analysis of forum discussion threads. In OSS forums, threads
enable topic specific discussions. A thread begins with a user creat-
ing a post, and then members of that OSS community joining the

thread by responding to its posts. We analyzed the progression of
threads in four OSS forums in terms of thread length and time span.
Thread length acts as a proxy for the complexity of the topic under
discussion and time span can reflect how active and responsive the
community is. Early study on developer discussion forums have
adopted similar metrics to measure community evolution [20].

To understand user behaviors in OSS forums, we also analyzed
the cases when the threads lacked response from the community.
In particular, we define Ignored Threads as the ones that did not
receive comments from members other than the original post au-
thor, and define Abandoned Threads as those that never received
a follow-up comment from the original author. We calculated the
percentages of those threads in each forum to understand the re-
sponsiveness of thread authors and the OSS communities.

3.3.2 Analysis of forum participants’ roles and their activities. We
classified all forum users into three categories: Organizers, Devel-
opers, and End-Users considering their roles in the OSS community.
Organizers (ORG) manage and maintain the forum’s integrity and
quality. They are assigned administrative privilege on forums and
perform duties such as approving, curating, or even suspending
posts made by other forum users. They can also directly contribute
to the discussion. This role is named differently in each forum and
can be further divided to sub-roles. For example, it is called Admin
in Zotero and Site Administrator in VLC. For Audacity, such role
includes Site Admin, Forum Staff, Quality Assurance, etc. In RStu-
dio forum, it includes Sustainer and RStudio Employee. To avoid
confusion we use the term Organizers to refer to them. Developers
(DEV) contribute to developing the respective OSS. Specifically,
we considered forum users who have code contributions to the
repositories of the respective OSS in GitHub as DEV. As described
in Section 3.2, this is achieved through matching the GitHub user-
names of contributors of an OSS to the usernames of the associated
forum users for the OSS. We excluded the forum users who have
already been categorized to an ORG role during this step to avoid
multiple labels. We consider the forum users who were not catego-
rized as DEV or ORG as End-Users (EU) of the OSS.

Along the axis of OSS community roles, we first considered
concrete activity types and their frequencies related to posting
(1) Initialize a thread, i.e., create the first post of a thread in an
OSS forum; (2) Follow up the thread initialized by themselves by
writing reply post; (3) Contribute to threads that other users inside
a forum initialized. This analysis aimed to understand the overall
communication pattern of the OSS forum users. We then compared
the user tenure, in terms of active days in the forum, of the three
categories of forum users.

3.3.3 Analysis of linguistic features of different roles. To investi-
gate how forum users’ roles are correlated with their intentions,
emotions, confidence, and other psychological states, we further
conducted an linguistic analysis on the content of their posts. In
particular, we selected seven categories from the LIWC2015 dictio-
nary [27]. These categories were identified as most relevant to the
context of OSS user forums and communication behaviors. Table 2
summarizes these categories and our rationale of choosing them.
To calculate the LIWC scores for these categories, we first iso-
lated the individual natural language posts from the scrapped data
and tagged each post with the user role. We then directly used

Figure 1: Distribution of time until the first Non-Original
Poster’s Response in a thread (with outliers removed based
on the 1.5 ∗ 𝐼𝑄𝑅 criterion).

LIWC to process the text documents; LIWC performs basic NLP
preprocessing steps such as tokenization, handling capitalization,
and stemming [26, 27]. To understand how each role scores differ-
ently on each LIWC category for each forum, we considered the
seven LIWC categories as the dependent variables and the cate-
gories of forum users as the independent variable (i.e. end-user,
developer, and organizer) and conducted a statistical analysis. We
first performed Shapiro-Wilk tests on our dataset and determined
that our sample does not follow a normal distribution on all de-
pendent variables. Levene’s tests also revealed that all dependent
variables had unequal variances on the independent groups. Then
we performed the Kruskal Wallis test on our dataset, followed by
a pair-wise post-hoc test (Bonferroni corrected Mann-Whitney U)
for all significant results. We finally calculated the effect size for
each significant finding.

4 CHARACTERIZING FORUM THREADS

(RQ1)

4.1 Thread Life Span Analysis
For RQ1, we began with examining how responsive the community
was to new threads in the forum by analyzing how long it took
for a thread to receive the first response from the forums users
who were not the author of the initial post. There were in total
57,230 threads in our dataset (7,661 in Zotero, 2,007 in Audacity,
35,913 in VLC, and 11,649 in RStudio) that did not receive any
response from other forum users than the original poster or did not
receive any response at all; we leave the analysis on those threads
in Section 4.3. We next removed the outliers based on the 1.5 IQR
criterion; a total of 38,954 threads were removed in this process,
including 12,644 from the Zotero forum, 7,181 from the Audacity
forum, 14,291 from the VLC forum, and 4,838 from the RStudio
forum. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the feedback time of
threads in user forums with outliers removed. Across all forums, the
median community response time was 10.83 hours (𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 35.15).
Zotero has the shortest median community response time of 3.22
hours (𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 15.92) while VLC has the longest median community
response time of 23.15 hours (𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 73.53). Interestingly, the
community response time in the Audacity forum follows a multi-
peak distribution of roughly 24-hour intervals, indicating that the
responses tended to happen during certain times of the day.

Explanation
Degree of formal, logical, and hierarchical thinking exhibited. A
higher score refers to the presence of more analytical contents
[28].
How much the text displays an honest, personal, or disclosing
voice with a lower number indicating a more guarded or distanced
form of speech [21].
The amount of expertise and confidence a forum user possesses
(reflected in their posts), with a lower score indicating a more
tentative, humble, or anxious voice [13].
The emotional tone of a text; a high score represents more positive
and upbeat styles, while a lower score revealing anxiety, sadness,
or hostility [6].
Depth and complexity in which forum users are processing and
interpreting information [33].
Indicates how users express emotion in their posts. It also reveals
how an individual is coping with an event [33].
Degree of the needs, motives, drives, risks, rewards, and power
references mentioned by the forum users [26].

Justification
OSS forums experience complex discussions between users, we select
this category to investigate how different user groups use logical and
analytical expressions.
Users often disclose issues or experiences to get feedback; we select
this category to analyze how users go about this process and how this
reflects in their communication styles.
To understand the level of confidence forum users exhibit while par-
ticipating in the forum.

OSS forums are a place for people to go for help when they experience
problems, inspecting ‘Tone’ will allow us to understand how different
user groups.
This category will allow us to analyze how forum users think and
process information.
Identify how users express emotions to events that either lead them
to use the forum or happened while using the forum.
We analyze this category to investigate the amount of drives and
motivations expressed by forum users.

a consistent pattern in threads’ lengths across the four OSS forums,
with a median length of 3 posts (𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 3.0). Similarly, we found
that the number of unique forum users who participated in the
discussion threads was also consistent across the four forums, with
a median of 2 users (𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 1.0). Combining these results with the
life span analysis, we conclude that most of the discussions in OSS
end-user oriented forums are short-lived with a small amount of
information exchange among a few community members. At the
same time, however, thread lengths and unique user numbers in
each thread had wide distributions, with a maximum of 1,928 posts
that involved 478 users (from the Zotero forum). One reason behind
the length of threads could be the complexity of topics discussed in
the threads. For example, in the Zotero forum, a lengthy discussion
(32 posts) took place on creating a reference entry from a PDF file,
and due to huge demand, that feature was included in Zotero.

4.3 Ignored and Abandoned Threads
We saw that a significant number of threads in OSS forums failed to
reach a decisive resolved state. Those threads mostly fell into two
categories; i.e., they either did not receive any response from the
community (Ignored Threads) or the author of the initial posts did
not follow up to the threads afterwards (Abandoned Threads).

We found that the percentages of ignored threads differed greatly
across the four OSS forums. The lowest percentage was found in the
Audacity forum, with 4.14%, followed by Zotero (10.81%). The VLC
and RStudio forums tended to have a higher percentage of ignored
threads (31.52% and 27.53%, respectively). These results may have
reflected how various types of community members respond to
the posted topics differently across the four forums. We leave this
analysis in Section 5.

Surprisingly, almost half (48.77%) of the threads posted in the four
forums were abandoned. The percentages of abandoned threads
in the individual forums did not differ much, with the highest rate
found in the VLC forum (56.14%), followed by RStudio (47.25%),

Figure 2: Distribution of threads life span (i.e. from the first
post to the latest response) in the four OSS forums (with out-
liers removed based on the 1.5 ∗ 𝐼𝑄𝑅 criterion).

We then calculated the life span of a discussion thread as the
number of days elapsed from the initial post to the latest response
in a thread. During this analysis, we ignored in total 47,824 threads
(Zotero: 6,366, Audacity: 1,573, VLC: 29,985, and RStudio: 9,900)
which did not receive any response. We also removed the outliers
on the remaining data based on the 1.5 IQR criterion; a total of
39,769 threads were removed in this process, including 12,749 from
the Zotero forum, 7,346 from the Audacity forum, 14,928 from the
VLC forum, and 4,746 from the RStudio forum. Figure 2 shows the
distribution of threads’ life span in the four forums with outliers
removed. The median thread life span for all four OSS forums
was 17.72 hours (𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 47.88). Among the four project, Zotero
has the shortest median thread life span of 5.13 hours (𝐼𝑄𝑅 =
23.42), followed by RStudio (𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 11.40 hours, 𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 32.48).
Audacity (𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 21.83 hours, 𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 40.62) and VLC (𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 =
28.50 hours, 𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 90.74) tended to have longer thread life spans.

4.2 Thread Length Analysis
To explore the density of discussions in the OSS forums, we calcu-
lated the number of posts found in each thread. Our results indicated

Audacity (43.64%), and Zotero (41.32%). We hypothesize that this is
due to the overall culture and the general behavior of forums’ users.
Even when the topic from the initial posts have already been fully
discussed and addressed by the community, the original authors
were not aware of the necessity or sufficiently motivated to return
to the thread to confirm their status or express their gratitude.

5 PARTICIPATION OF VARIOUS ROLES (RQ2)
Following the method described in Section 3.3.2, we divided the
roles of forum users into three categories, i.e. Organizers (ORG),
Developers (Dev), and End-Users (EU). Table 3 presents a summary
of the distributions of those roles in the four OSS forums. We also
calculated the End-Users-to-Non-End-Users ratio, representing the
hypothetical workload if a topic initialized by the end-users requires
the organizers or developers to resolve. Audacity represents the
highest ratio with 3008 EU to one Non-EU. The short respond time
and low ignored thread rate for Audacity seems to suggest the
community is coping with the situation well. In this section, we
take a close look at the actions taken by different roles in the forums
and the content of their posts to understand how they participate
and collaborate in their communities.

5.1 Analysis of Participation Type (RQ2.1)
5.1.1 Post Type Distribution. In our analysis, we considered three
types of participation of the forum users: (1) posting to start a
thread (Initial Post), (2) following up to a thread that is initiated
by themselves (Replies by Original Poster), and (3) respond to a
thread initiated by someone else (Replies by Others). Among all
the posts across the four forums, 22.74% were initial posts, 25.31%
were replies by original poster, and 51.94% were replies by others.
Both VLC and RStudio forums contained higher percentages of
initial posts (27.46% and 25.08% respectively). In contrast, Zotero
and Audacity forums had lower percentages of initial posts (18.21%
and 20.21% respectively) but higher ratio of replies by others (56.33%
and 54.78% respectively), indicating a more engaged information
exchange among their members. Lastly, the fact that about half
of all posts for each forum were replies by others suggests that,
regardless of the OSS project, members of the OSS forums were
actively engaged in discussions.

5.1.2 Participation of different forum user roles. We calculated the
frequencies of each category of forum users creating posts for
each post type, summarized in Figure 3. As depicted in the left
column of Figure 3, end-users made the majority of the initial
posts across all four OSS forums. Consequently, they were also the
ones who contributed to the majority of the replies by the original
poster (middle column of Figure 3). Organizers and developers only

occasionally initialized a topic, normally related to announcements
of the software product, development progress, and forum rules.

With respect to replying to others’ posts, the distributions of
role categories are more diverse among the four forums (see Fig-
ure 3, right column). In the Audacity forum, most of the responses
were provided by a handful of forum organizers. For Zotero, forum
organizers and developers without forum privileges together con-
tributed to 62.4% of the replies to others’ post. The active responses
from the organizers and developers may have contributed to the
lower rate of ignored issues in the Audacity and Zotero forums that
we found before (see Section 4.3). Meanwhile, a large number of
end-users participated in discussions initiated by others, especially
in the VLC and RStudio forums (64.5% and 75.8%, respectively).
These results indicate that overall end-users play a critical role in
OSS communities in providing feedback and support to other forum
users, besides seeking resolution to their own issues.

5.1.3 Tenure of forum users. We used the tenure of forum users
(i.e., time between the first and the last posts of the forum users)
to indicate how long the forum users have participated in the OSS
community. Figure 4 summarizes this information for end-users,
developers, and organizers across the four OSS forums. As expected,
end-users generally had shorter tenures than developers and orga-
nizers across the four forums. However, there was a big variance in
the duration of end-users’ activities. In all four forums, there were
some end-users who started their contribution since the beginning
of the forum and were still active at the time of our data collection.

5.2 Analysis of Post Contents (RQ2.2)
To gain further insight into how the three OSS roles approached
communications in the user forums, we performed an analysis on
the textual content of the posts using linguistic features. In this anal-
ysis, we considered three independent groups, i.e., end-users (EU),
developers (DEV), and organizers (ORG) and seven dependent vari-
ables, i.e., analytic, clout, tone, authentic, cognitive process, affective

50 (neutral tones) while the median scores for all organizers and
the remaining developer groups were 25.77 (negative tones).

Insight-Tone. End-users exhibited significantly higher me-
dian scores (i.e. more positive with respect to developers and
organizers, but still neutral in tone) than organizers for all
forums and developers for Zotero and VLC.

The ‘Authentic’ category results for the four forums illustrate
that end-users were significantly more honest and open (with the
highest median scores) than the organizers and developers across all
forums. However, only Zotero and VLC had a significant difference
between developers and organizers. The developer-organizer pair
in Zotero had a median developer score higher than the organizer.
Oppositely, the developer-organizer pair in VLC had a median
organizer score higher than the developer.

Insight-Authentic. End-users exhibited more openness a-

nd honesty than organizers and developers in all forums.

Moving to the dictionary categories, we inspected the cognitive
processes. Similar to ‘Authentic’, the ‘cogproc’ category exhibited
quite diverse results: (a) VLC had no significant pairs; (b) Audacity
only had one significant pair (EU-ORG); (c) both Zotero and RStudio
saw all the pairs significantly different. Further inspection showed
significant differences in the three forums (Zotero, RStudio, and
Audacity), end-users in Zotero and RStudio had lower median ‘cog-
proc’ scores than organizers, but EU had the same median scores
as organizers in Audacity.

Insight-cogproc. The amount of cognitive processes in po-
sts appeared to be forum-dependent, yet end-users’ posts re-
flected less cognitive complexity, in general.

The ‘affect’ category was significantly different for all pairs in
three of the forums (Zotero, VLC, RStudio) while the Audacity
forum was not different between developers and organizers. For all
four forums, the end-users had a median higher than organizers
and developers. Moreover, an inspection into the subcategories of
‘posemo’ and ‘negemo’ showed more use of positive emotion words
than the negative emotion words despite experiencing issues or
negative occurrences with the OSS that led them to use the forum.
Insight-affect. End-users had consistently different and h-

igher scores than organizers and developers in all forums.

Last, the ‘drives’ category experienced consistent differences be-
tween end-users and organizers where the median end-user score
was higher than the median organizer score. Moreover, the re-
maining forums’ pairs (end-users and developers, developers and
organizers) were all significantly different except for the RStudio’s
end-user and developer pair. Additionally, the developer and or-
ganizer median scores were inconsistent; Zotero and Audacity’s
median organizer scores were higher than the developers’ while
their scores reversed in RStudio and VLC.

Insight-drives. End-users appeared to be more need-driv-
en and motivated than the other groups, and the developers’
and organizers’ linguistic behavior was forum-dependent.

6 DISCUSSION
In this study, we characterized user behaviors in OSS user forums.
Section 5.1 revealed how different categories of forum users made
contributions to OSS user forums following distinct patterns. All
forums possessed a large end-user base who not only initiated

process, and drives calculated using LIWC. Kruskal Wallis Tests
revealed statistically significant results among the three indepen-
dent groups on all LIWC categories across all forums (𝑝 < 0.001),
excluding the cognitive process category for VLC (𝑝 > 0.05). The
results for the post-hoc Mann-Whitney U Test and the effect sizes
can be seen in Table 4.

For the ‘Analytic’ category, the difference was significant for all
pairs of user groups on the Zotero and Audacity forums, while only
the differences between end-users and developers and end-users
and organizers were significant for VLC and RStudio. Particularly,
developers were the most analytical on the Zotero and Audacity
forums, while on RStudio and VLC, organizers and end-users were
the most analytical respectively. Moreover, Zotero’s median analyt-
ical scores for end-users were higher than organizers while they
were opposite in Audacity.

Insight-Analytic. The use of analytical speech among fo-

rum user groups appeared to be forum-dependent.

On the dimension of ‘Clout’, the scores were fairly consistent
throughout the forums. All forums saw significant differences
among all their participant pairs, with end-users’ median ‘Clout’
scores the lowest, indicating end-users’ conversations lacked confi-
dence. Zotero and Audacity’s median organizer scores were higher
than the developer’s scores, VLC had equal median scores for orga-
nizers and developers, and RStudio experienced median developer
scores higher than median organizer scores.

Insight-Clout. End-users exhibited the lowest clout scores

(i.e., confidence) than the other two groups in all forums.

The tonality of the participants’ posts across the forums illus-
trated that the differences between end-users and organizers are
the most significant; end-users exhibited higher median scores than
organizers for all forums and, in cases where end-users were signif-
icantly different from developers (Zotero, VLC, and RStudio), were
also higher than developers. The difference between developers and
organizers was significant for three of the forums (Audacity, RStu-
dio, and VLC) but there were conflicting results on which groups
have higher median scores. Lastly, all median scores for end-users
(in addition to the developers of Audacity and RStudio) were near

almost all threads but also replied to other users’ posts and displayed
more positivity and openness in communication. These findings
suggest that this large body of enthusiastic, motivated people could
become an asset in the OSS development process by providing
firsthand usability and accessibility-related feedback. Moreover, our
results indicated that the discussion threads on user forums were
often short in time span (𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 17.72 hours) and the number of
comments (𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛 = 3). Interestingly, forum users were generally
responsive in replying to new posts (median delay = 10.83 hours)
but they often ignored or abandoned older posts, including their
own posts – perhaps because recent posts are usually displayed
first in the forums, while revisiting older posts requires a laborious
process (i.e., manually search). Another reason could be the lack of
proper guidance on using forums (e.g., properly closing a thread or
using forum features) that we observed during manual inspection
of the forums. Therefore, further work is required to explore ways
to aid end-users’ on-boarding process to the OSS community.

The insights from linguistic analyses (Section 5.2) present a
foundation for identifying potential strategies moving forward to
encourage end-users to participate in the OSS development process.
In particular, the insights from the ‘Clout’, ‘Tone’, ‘Authentic’, and
‘Affect’ categories show that end-users in all four forums are signif-
icantly less confident than the organizers, but are simultaneously
more divulging, open, and positive in their communications. Since
the current OSS development process often overlooks the contri-
butions from end-users [9, 38], some end-users can be reluctant or
apprehensive to use forums unless it is a last resort for obtaining
help [9]. This is likely reflected in the end-user LIWC results with
the low ‘Clout’ scores but higher ‘Tone’, ‘Authentic’, and ‘affect’.
Towards the goal of bringing end-users who may not be able to
contribute codes into the OSS development pipeline, the forum
end-users’ inclination towards more neutral or positive, personable,
analytical communication is promising. Especially when combined
with the fact that the end-users used the most words in the ’drives’

category (indicating they were working towards a specific goal to
achieve), there is support to our claim that some end-users from
the vast forum end-user base would be interested in participat-
ing further in the OSS development process, though they lack the
confidence to do so now.

The LIWC analysis results indicated that organizers and devel-
opers could make more efforts through their language. Based on
these findings, we provide the following recommendation to better
support helping and sustaining end-users: We suggest for organiz-
ers and developers to adopt a more open, personal, and positive
tone to match the current practice of end-users when communicat-
ing in the forums. If organizers and developers can become more
welcoming and supportive of end-users in the forums, then ideally
it can encourage more end-users to participate in various aspects
of the OSS development processes, even if they lack the skills to
code. Looking to the future, including end-users in the OSS devel-
opment process will be essential for improving OSS, in particular
as end-user bases grow and diversify [38].

Finally, the ‘Analytic’ category was one of a few whose results
indicated features unique to the specific forums. While we expected
that developers or organizers would be most analytical in their
speech based on the assumption that these stakeholders would use
logical arguments and explanations to help end-users, the results
did not support this hypothesis; we found that, in some forums,
developers were more analytical than end-users but was the oppo-
site in others. The cause of these phenomena might be related to
the level of end-user participation in investigating and answering
questions posted by other users. For example, RStudio and VLC had
more replies by others performed by end-users than developers and
organizers, corresponding with the higher average analytical scores
for end-users. While further analysis is needed to confirm this as
the cause for the ‘Analytic’ scores, these results illustrate that for
this category, a forum’s participant groups can exhibit different
behaviors that are dependent on the context of the forum itself.

7 LIMITATIONS & THREATS TO VALIDITY
This study suffers from the following limitations and threats to
validity that we plan to address in the future.

First, we were only able to focus on four OSS user forums in our
analysis. Our sample was selected from the Open Source Software
Directory 6, across different categories and sorted alphabetically,
where we targeted the most downloaded OSS applications that
the authors were already familiar with. Moreover, while all the
forums that were selected are managed in English, occasionally
users wrote their posts in other languages (around 4% per forum
based on our investigations). Initial investigations with automatic
language detection methods experienced many false negatives;
therefore we decided to process all posts as the non-English posts
only trivially impacted the results.

Second, when identifying the roles of forum users, we used
their user ID as a token to cross-reference developers from the
GitHub repository of the OSS projects. While our manual inspection
indicated that developers tended to use the same user ID on both the
forums and GitHub, we cannot guarantee that this cross-reference
is complete. We found that the percentages of GitHub contributors

matched with the forum users of the Zotero, Audacity, VLC, and
RStudio projects are, respectively: 42.1%; 3.1%; 6.5%; and 22.6%.
Furthermore, we considered the end-users as one single group
despite our analysis revealing a wide range in the demonstrated
activities (i.e., some users have participated since project inception
while most participated only sparsely).

Third, our analysis adopted mostly a quantitative methodology
which allowed us to manage a large amount of data; future studies
focusing on qualitative analysis of a sample of forum discussions
may help explain more of our insights. Particularly, in regards to
thread topics and power dynamics between user groups.

Finally, our analysis is based only on the observed behavior of the
user forums. We acknowledge that a large amount of end-users of
OSS projects are not able to or choose not to contribute and engage
in the user forums. Their perspectives and experiences with the
OSS application, although important, are not visible. Future work
focusing on user studies, such as surveys and interviews with OSS
end-users, would be useful to understand these and other invisible
perspectives.

8 CONCLUSION
We performed an empirical study on over 1.3 million posts from
four popular OSS user forums: Zotero, Audacity, VLC, and RStu-
dio. Our study employed two methods (1) analyzing forum users’
roles and types of activities, particularly the frequency and breadth
of user interactions, and (2) conducting psycho-linguistic analysis
using LIWC to analyze the contribution patterns and behaviors
amongst the forum user categories (end-users, developers, and or-
ganizers). We found that these three user categories can make an
initial post, reply as the original poster, or reply as another poster.
End-users make the most initial posts but also actively engage in
other peoples’ thread conversations. Moreover, the LIWC results
show significantly different linguistic behavior between user pairs,
particularly in terms of ‘Clout’, ‘Tone’, ‘Authentic’, and ‘affect’. Over-
all, end-users demonstrate more positive and disclosing natures
compared to developers and organizers in forums but are signifi-
cantly less confident. Our work presents novel characterizations
of user behaviors in OSS user forums to be leveraged to increase
end-user engagement in the larger OSS community.
