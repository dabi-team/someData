ABSTRACT
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is focusing on relatively bright stars and has found thousands of planet
candidates. However, mainly because of the low spatial resolution of its cameras (‚âà 21 arcsec/pixel), TESS is expected to
detect several false positives (FPs); hence, vetting needs to be done. Here, we present a follow-up program of TESS candidates
orbiting solar-analogue stars that are in the all-sky PLATO input catalogue. Using Gaia photometry and astrometry we built
an absolute colour-magnitude diagram and isolated solar-analogue candidates‚Äô hosts. We performed a probabilistic validation
of each candidate using the vespa software and produced a prioritized list of objects that have the highest probability of being
genuine transiting planets. Following this procedure, we eliminated the majority of FPs and statistically vetted 23 candidates.
For this remaining set, we performed a stellar neighbourhood analysis using Gaia Early Data Release 3 and centroid motion
tests, greatly enhancing the on-target probability of 12 of them. We then used publicly available high-resolution imaging data
to conÔ¨Årm their transit source and found Ô¨Åve new, fully validated planets. For the remaining candidates, we propose on-oÔ¨Ä
photometry to further reÔ¨Åne the list of genuine candidates and prepare for the subsequent radial velocity follow-up.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al. 2014)
is a NASA all-sky survey telescope designed to search for transit-
ing exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. With its array of four ultra-
wide-Ô¨Åeld cameras, TESS has been delivering, since July 2018, both
short-cadence photometry and target pixel Ô¨Åle images on pre-selected
targets, and full-frame images (FFIs) with a 30- or 10-minute cadence
(during the nominal and extended mission, respectively). These data
are downlinked to the ground, where they are then further analysed
with transit-search pipelines developed by the Science Processing
Operations centre (SPOC). This applies to short cadence images
(Jenkins et al. 2016) and, starting from sector 36, to some targets
selected from the FFIs (Caldwell et al. 2020), while every FFI is also
analysed with the Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP, Huang et al. 2020).
The candidate planets found by the SPOC and QLP are then vetted1

by the MIT branch of the TESS Science oÔ¨Éce (TSO), and those
candidates that survive are later deÔ¨Åned as TESS Objects of Interest
(TOIs, Guerrero et al. 2021).

TESS focuses on relatively bright, nearby stars and is Ô¨Ånding thou-
sands of transiting planet candidates. However, because of the low
spatial resolution of its cameras (‚âà 21 arcsec/pixel), a percentage
of objects initially identiÔ¨Åed as exoplanet candidates are expected to
be false positives (FPs). In fact, the crowding of stars within the 1
arcmin2 point spread function (PSF) of TESS might cause two (or
more) stars to appear merged into the TESS time-series. Therefore,
if an exoplanet orbits around a star that is blended with another in
the TESS images, then the transit signal in the light curve is diluted.
If another star ‚Äì blended in the TESS PSF ‚Äì is present in the same
pixel, it could be the origin of the transit signal by either being an
eclipsing binary or hosting a planet itself.

Some FPs are identiÔ¨Åable using TESS data alone, but the major-
ity of them need further observations (Ricker et al. 2015). To avoid
wasting observational time and optimize follow-up resources, it is
possible to identify the most promising candidates through a quick
and eÔ¨Écient probabilistic validation procedure, which aids in dis-
tinguishing between a planet and a FP from a particular transiting
candidate (Morton 2012).

G. Mantovan et al.

In this work, we present our probabilistic validation analysis of ev-
ery TOI orbiting a solar-analogue target that is in the all-sky PLATO
input catalogue (Montalto et al. 2021), for which time-series or high-
precision radial velocities follow-up observations are not yet avail-
able. We consider only candidates without follow-up observations
available on the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program for TESS
(ExoFOP-TESS) website2to provide an original analysis and avoid
duplicated work. The software we use to perform such probabilistic
validation is the vespa code, which is computationally eÔ¨Écient and
publicly-available (Morton 2012). By following this procedure, we
are able to identify the majority of FP candidates. For the remaining
set, we perform a stellar neighbourhood analysis using Gaia Early
Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) and
on-oÔ¨Ä photometry (Deeg et al. 2009) to further reÔ¨Åne the list of can-
didates and prepare for the subsequent radial velocity follow-up. As
we will explain further in Section 5.1.1, throughout this work we
label every candidate that passes only the vespa analysis as a ‚Äòvet-
ted‚Äô candidate; on the other hand, we refer to those that also pass the
stellar neighbourhood analysis and meet a speciÔ¨Åc list of constraints
as ‚Äòstatistically validated planets‚Äô. Furthermore, our work is a perfect
case study of using vespa on PLATO data in the future, as the tele-
scopes will have a similar spatial resolution (Laubier et al. 2017).
This study could be the framework for future PLATO vetting.

In Section 2 we brieÔ¨Çy describe the methods we used to perform
probabilistic validation analysis and stellar neighbourhood analysis;
in Section 3 we explain how we selected our sample of TOIs orbiting
PLATO solar-analogue targets, while in Section 4 we show the results
of our validation analysis, paying speciÔ¨Åc attention to the planetary
size of the statistically-vetted targets we found. In Section 5 we dis-
cuss our results, provide suggestions for the follow-up observations,
specify the nomenclature used, and call attention to the importance
of performing a stellar neighbourhood analysis. Concluding remarks
are in Section 6.

2 METHODS

In this work, we performed the fully automated probabilistic valida-
tion procedure following Morton (2012) & Morton et al. (2016) for
158 TOIs orbiting solar-analogue stars that are in the all-sky PLATO
input catalogue, v1.1 (asPIC1.1, Montalto et al. 2021). The selection
of these stars is described in Section 3, while in the following of this
Section we describe the validation algorithms.

2.1 VESPA

The vespa code (Validation of Exoplanet Signals using a Proba-
bilistic Algorithm) is a publicly-available software package (Morton
2012) that models light curves of eclipsed stars as simple trapezoids
parameterized by a depth ùõø, a total duration ùëá, and the transit shape
parameter ùëá/ùúè, where ùúè is the ingress (or egress) duration, and sim-
ulates physically realistic populations of astrophysical FPs.

Validating an exoplanet candidate is equivalent to demonstrating
that the False Positive Probability (FPP) is small enough to be con-
sidered negligible. vespa calculates the FPP as follows:

FPP = 1 ‚àí Pr(planet|signal),
where

Pr(planet|signal) =

LTPùúãTP
LTPùúãTP + LFPùúãFP

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2021)

deÔ¨Ånes the probability that there is a planet given the observed signal.
In equation 2, L represents the Bayesian likelihood factor, which
says how similar is the shape of the observed transit signal to the
expected signal shape produced by the hypothesis (false positive or
planet scenarios). The prior ùúã describes how intrinsically probable a
priori is the existence of the hypothesized scenario. In particular, TP
indicates a "true positive".

vespa supports the following hypotheses:

‚Ä¢ Eclipsing binary system in the background or foreground, blended

within the photometric aperture of the target star (BEB);

‚Ä¢ The target is a hierarchical-triple system where two of the compo-

nents eclipse each other (HEB);

‚Ä¢ The target star is an eclipsing binary (EB);
‚Ä¢ Transiting planet (Pl)3.

Furthermore, vespa supports double-period versions of each FP sce-
nario. This is done to avoid, for example, the case in which an EB with
twice the orbital period of the detected candidate, and with similar
primary and secondary eclipse depths, is confused with a transiting
planet.

BrieÔ¨Çy, the vespa validation procedure works in this way:

(i) Simulation of a representative population for each hypothesis
scenario listed above (Ô¨Åxing the period). Each population is
made up of many diÔ¨Äerent instances of that scenario;

(ii) Calculation of the prior (ùúã) for each scenario, which is the
product of three factors: the existence probability of the anal-
ysed scenario within the photometric aperture, the geometric
probability of orbital alignment for which an eclipse is visible
and the probability that the eclipse is able to mimic a transit
(Morton 2012);

(iii) Calculation of the likelihood (L) of the observed transit signal
for each scenario, where vespa models the shape of the eclipse
and Ô¨Åts it to the observed light curve. This is done through
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations;

(iv) Combination of prior and likelihood to calculate the FPP of
the transit signal (Equation 1). If the FPP is < 1 per cent, then
the candidate can be considered as probabilistically vetted4.

We refer the reader to Morton (2012) & Morton et al. (2016) for a

detailed description of the method.

2.1.1 Data and constraints

We fed vespa with the following stellar and planetary parameters:

- equatorial coordinates, Gaia photometric magnitudes, and paral-

lax (see Section 2.1.2) from Gaia EDR3;

- stellar eÔ¨Äective temperature ùëáeÔ¨Ä, gravity logùëî, and metallicity
[Fe/H]5 from Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST);
- mean stellar density ùúå in units of [g cm‚àí3] and maximum extinc-

tion in the V band (maxAV) from asPIC1.1;

3 vespa does not consider "blended transiting planet" FP scenarios (Morton
et al. 2016).
4 It is crucial to note that, as further explained by Morton et al. (2016), a
vetted candidate requires to have a ‚Äòprobability > 99% of being on the target
star‚Äô to be fully ‚Äòvalidated‚Äô. Therefore, as we explain in Section 5.1.1, we will
label a candidate as fully ‚Äòvalidated‚Äô only after proving this constraint.
5 We used ùëáeÔ¨Ä , logùëî and [Fe/H] in the vespa calculation only if their values
come from spectroscopy; otherwise, we avoided adding these input parame-
ters.

ing Program for TESS (ExoFOP-TESS).

We used the detrended and phase-folded time-series extracted from
TESS data available in the MAST portal (see Section 2.1.3).

Validation of TOIs orbiting solar analogues

We deÔ¨Åned the maximum angular distance (maxrad in vespa) from
the target star where a potential blending star might be, as the radius
of the aperture (ùëücirc) for circular aperture photometry. Otherwise,
we assumed the area (ùê¥) covered by the TESS aperture as circular
and computed the radius as:
ùëüùë°ùëíùë†ùë† = ‚àöÔ∏Åùê¥/ùúã;

(3)

ùê¥ = ùëÅpx √ó ùë†2,

where ùëÅpx is the number of pixels within the TESS aperture and ùë†
is the TESS platescale that is equal to 21 arcsec/pixel. As a safety
margin, it is useful to add the TESS PSF of 40 arcsec to both radii
(Stassun et al. 2018), i.e., maxrad = ùëücirc + 40 arcsec and maxrad =
ùëüùë°ùëíùë†ùë† + 40 arcsec.

As described by Rowe et al. (2015) and Morton et al. (2016)6,
we quantiÔ¨Åed the maximum depth of a potential secondary eclipse
(ùõømax, secthresh in vespa). We ran a transit search in the TOI light
curve and looked for the deepest signal allowed at phases outside the
transit (ùõøsec). We compute ùõømax as ùõømax = ùõøsec + 3ùúésec, where ùúésec
is the uncertainty associated with ùõøsec.

Then, we inferred physical properties of the star (see Sec. 4.1)
given the photometric, spectroscopic, and observational constraints
described above using the Isochrones package (Morton 2015) and
Ô¨Ånally computed the FPP with vespa.

2.1.2 Bayesian evidence

As explained in Morton et al. (2016), to start the validation proce-
dure, all available constraints on the target star are used to condition a
direct Ô¨Åt of a single- or multiple-star model to the MIST grid of stellar
models (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016; Paxton et al. 2011). This Ô¨Åt is
done using multi-modal nested sampling, implemented with Multi-
Nest. Consequently, Isochrones produces posterior samplings of
the physical properties of the host star, modelled as a single- or
multiple-star system. To compute the FPP, vespa requires the phys-
ical properties of each stellar model (single, binary, and triple) to
evaluate each diÔ¨Äerent scenario. When multi-modal posteriors are
sampled with the MultiNest tool, the Bayesian evidence (Feroz
et al. 2019) is also computed. This particular parameter allows us to
understand the degree to which the data imply a given model (Knuth
et al. 2015). Therefore, it is usual to prefer the model that implies the
greatest Bayesian evidence (Kass & Raftery 1995).

In our validation procedure, we found out that inserting as input
only the observed Gaia photometric magnitudes ‚Äì instead of adding
other photometric magnitudes ‚Äì produced the strongest Bayesian
evidence. For this reason, we preferred to insert only the Gaia G, BP,
and RP magnitudes into the vespa input Ô¨Åle.

2.1.3 TESS photometry

For our analysis of the TESS light curves, we accessed the TESS
data by downloading the SPOC Presearch Data Conditioning Simple
Aperture Photometry (PDCSAP) Ô¨Çux light curves (Smith et al. 2012;
Stumpe et al. 2014) for the short cadence candidates, which have

times the transit duration on each side. The green line is a trapezoidal Ô¨Åtting

been observed in multiple sectors and have been stitched together
by the TESS mission in the so-called Data Validation Time Series
Ô¨Åles. These Ô¨Åles can be found in the MAST portal. When instead
we deal with TOIs from FFIs, we downloaded the QLP normalized
light curves detrended by splines (KSPSAP). In cases where QLP
multisectors observations had been available, we stitched together
each light curve and then we performed the phase-folding procedure
(Fig. 1).

2.2 Stellar neighbourhood analysis

To further understand the real nature of a TESS candidate, it is nec-
essary to accurately analyse its stellar neighbourhood, to understand
if possible contaminating stars are present.

Thanks to Gaia photometry (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021), we
can check whether any neighbourhood star is able to generate a Ô¨Çux
in the aperture that corresponds at least to the observed Ô¨Çux vari-
ation. When this is not the case, we can exclude each Gaia source
to be a blended eclipsing binary and greatly enhance the probability
that the detected signal is coming from the target star. Consequently,
we developed a custom pipeline (further explained at the end of this
Section and in Section 2.2.1 & 2.2.2) to compute which neighbour-
hood stars could reproduce the observed transit signal. When none
of them can, we changed the value of the maxrad constraint within
the vespa input data and proceeded with the analysis. In this case,
we considered the spatial resolution of Gaia EDR3 ‚Äì that can resolve
close pairs of stars at 1.5 arcseconds separation ‚Äì as the minimum
value for the maxrad constraint. It is important to note that this is a
peculiar situation, which only happened to ‚àº 1/10 of our targets.

Therefore, it is often necessary to perform additional photometric
follow-up observations to conÔ¨Årm the source of the signal. We can
apply the so-called seeing-limited on-oÔ¨Ä photometry technique (Deeg
et al. 2009), which consists of the Ô¨Çux measurement ‚Äì with ground-
based imagers ‚Äì of the target star and neighbour stars within, for
example, 3.5 arcmins (10x10 TESS pixels, Stassun et al. 2019) during
the predicted on- and oÔ¨Ä-transit phases. Thanks to the much higher
angular resolution obtainable with some ground-based instruments
compared to TESS, we can either conÔ¨Årm or discard that the detected
signal is due to a genuine exoplanet candidate orbiting a given target
star. Using these high angular resolution imagers, we can Ô¨Årst resolve

most cases of stars that appear merged into the time-series obtained
by TESS; then ‚Äì depending on the photometric precision of the
instrument and the transit depth ‚Äì we can either:

(i) detect the source of the signal and verify if it does not exhibit
luminosity variations that are suÔ¨Éciently strong to cause a
false alarm (when we have high photometric precision and/or
a deep transit depth); or

(ii) focus on the photometry of the neighbourhood stars and verify
if none of them can reproduce the discovery signal (when we
have low photometric precision and/or a shallow transit depth).

Both strategies are able to detect the source of the signal. It is nec-
essary to note that for the success of this technique, it is crucial to
take into account the TESS ephemeris uncertainty (Epoch, Period,
and Duration) and perfectly plan the on-oÔ¨Ä observation windows. In
fact, the accumulation of the uncertainty over time shortens the win-
dow length in which we can precisely collect the oÔ¨Ä- and, especially,
on-transit phases. Thanks to the multi-year TESS observations, the
ephemeris uncertainty is often less of an issue. Nonetheless, it is
important to collect on-oÔ¨Ä photometry as close as possible to the last
TESS observation to avoid the accumulation of uncertainties. There-
fore, when we have many data points and ephemeris uncertainties
are small, we should shorten by 3ùúé both sides of the window length
of the on-transit phase, where ùúé takes into account the ephemeris
uncertainties and the ingress/egress duration. In addition to that, it is
essential to perform this follow-up with an observation band similar
to TESS, such as the Cousins ùêºc or the Sloan ùëñ(cid:48), to avoid the potential
obtainment of a transit depth diÔ¨Äerent than expected (see Sec. 4.5).
Both in the on-oÔ¨Ä technique and in the photometric analysis using
Gaia EDR3, we computed the expected magnitude variation that
any neighbourhood star have to generate to reproduce the transit
signal. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we followed Deeg et al. (2009) and found that a
transit signal originates from a neighbour star c if this star is able to
reproduce the discovery signal (ùë†):

(Œîùêπ/ùêπ)s =

ùëòcŒîùêπc
ùëòtùêπt + (cid:205) ùëòiùêπi

,

(4)

where t and i (with c ‚àà i) stand for target and contaminants respec-
tively, while ùëò is the fraction of light of the stellar PSF which falls
into the given photometric aperture. The aim of this photometric
follow-up is then to falsify the equation 4 for each neighbour star.
When we are analysing a contaminant star, we can rewrite equation
4 as follows:

Œîùêπc
ùêπc

(cid:18) ùëòtùêπt + (cid:205) ùëòiùêπi
ùëòcùêπc

(cid:19)

=

(Œîùêπ/ùêπ)s,

which in magnitude notation becomes:

(5)

Œîùëöc = ‚àí2.5 log

(cid:18)

1 ‚àí (Œîùêπ/ùêπ)s

(cid:18) ùëòt10‚àí0.4ùëöt + (cid:205) ùëòi10‚àí0.4ùëöi
ùëòc10‚àí0.4ùëöc

(cid:19) (cid:19)

.

(6)

The argument of the logarithm must be positive. This means that
each contaminating star needs to generate a Ô¨Çux in the aperture that
corresponds at least to the observed Ô¨Çux variation. If none of them
can pass this threshold, we can rule out each resolved neighbourhood
star as the source of the transit signal without taking a photomet-
ric observation to evaluate Œîùëöc. In this speciÔ¨Åc situation, we can
already move on to high-resolution imaging and precision radial ve-
locity observations; otherwise, we require ground-based photometric
observations to perform the on-oÔ¨Ä follow-up.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2021)

2.2.1 Diluted discovery signal

In our procedure, the discovery signal in equation 4 must be the one
coming from simple aperture photometry. This is important because
we need to conserve the possible stellar contamination coming from
neighbour stars to subsequently correct it with our pipeline. However,
the transit depth of a TOI ‚Äì provided by the TESS team ‚Äì comes from
a PDCSAP 7 Ô¨Çux light curve (hereafter, ùõøPDCSAP), which is already
corrected for the crowding contamination from known neighbour
stars (Guerrero et al. 2021). A similar amount of Ô¨Çux correction is
collected into the TIC contamination ratio parameter (Stassun et al.
2019), which is deÔ¨Åned as the nominal Ô¨Çux from the contaminants
divided by the Ô¨Çux from the source. The contaminants have been
searched for within 10 TESS pixels, and the contaminating Ô¨Çux has
been calculated within a radius that depends on the target‚Äôs Tmag.
Using this parameter, we can therefore recover, in a simplistic way,
the diluted transit depth as follows:

(Œîùêπ/ùêπ)s =

ùõøPDCSAP
(1 + CR)

(7)

where CR is the contamination ratio.

We recovered the diluted transit depth and performed a custom cor-
rection for stellar dilution for two reasons. Firstly, there are known
cases where the QLP planet radius has been inaccurate relative to un-
contaminated ground-based observations. This inaccuracy has often
turned out to be linked to the QLP deblending method, which is based
on the TESS magnitude estimates from the TIC (Huang et al. 2020).
Moreover, the QLP deblending method eÔ¨Äectively deblends the light
curve from contamination by an additional star inside the aperture
(Guerrero et al. 2021), whereas we deblend the transit depth from
contamination by any star whose Ô¨Çux falls inside the aperture. Sec-
ondly, SPOC simulates the contaminating Ô¨Çux in the Ô¨Åeld around the
target star from the full TICv7 catalogue for sectors 1-13 and TICv8
for sectors 14 onwards (Guerrero et al. 2021), and both use the Gaia
DR2 catalogue. In our pipeline, we used instead stellar parameters
from TICv8.2 and included parameters from the Gaia EDR3 cata-
logue. As we will specify in Section 2.2.2, we have used the TESS
photometric band to correct for stellar contamination. In particular,
we obtained the TESS magnitude of a Gaia star by cross-matching
TIC and Gaia catalogues through the Gaia ID of the star.

2.2.2 The k parameter

The ùëò parameter modiÔ¨Åes the expected magnitude diÔ¨Äerence that
is required to reproduce the transit signal. Its value depends on the
selected pixels and on the exact position of the given star in the
TESS aperture. In fact, the PSF of the telescope causes the light
from the target to fall onto several diÔ¨Äerent pixels. The photometric
aperture used to extract the light curve of a short-cadence TOI can be
found inside a Target Pixel File (TPF) object, which is an ensemble
of images taken for each observed cadence. DiÔ¨Äerently, for long-
cadence TOIs found with the QLP, the TESS aperture is circular and
its optimal radius is given by the QLP itself.

Thanks to the Pixel Response Function (PRF) provided by the
TESS mission, we can determine in which pixels the light from the
target falls. In detail, the PRF is a model that describes the image
of a point source and how it varies depending on where it lands on
the detector. Its shape comes from a combination of the optical point
spread function, jitter during observations, and intra-pixel location

7 or KSPSAP, if the speciÔ¨Åc TOI has been identiÔ¨Åed with the QLP pipeline.

of where the light lands8. The PRF images span 13x13 physical
TESS CCD pixels and have 9x9 intra-pixel samples per each pixel.
This ensures some pixel precision without having to interpolate. The
available PRF Ô¨Åles change among diÔ¨Äerent TESS sectors, cameras,
and CCDs.

The entire procedure for evaluating the ùëò parameter for an individ-
ual star (whether it is the target or a contaminant) can be described
as follows:

‚Ä¢ We extract the PRF at the exact pixel location of the star, where
the total Ô¨Çux is determined using the star‚Äôs TESS magnitude;
‚Ä¢ We evaluate the shift between the centre of the aperture and that
of the PRF (i.e., the separation between the centre of the aperture
and star location);

‚Ä¢ We calculate the exact contribution of the Ô¨Çux that falls into the
aperture. When the aperture is circular, we use the implementation
of the photutils package (Bradley et al. 2021). When dealing with
TPF apertures (made by multiple square pixels), we calculate four
weights to consider the displacement between the centre of an
aperture pixel and that of a PRF pixel. This displacement causes
an aperture pixel to overlap with up to a maximum of four PRF
pixels; therefore, to calculate the Ô¨Çux contribution from a single
aperture pixel, we need to consider the weighted contribution of
each of these four PRF pixels;

‚Ä¢ We divide the contribution of Ô¨Çux that falls into the aperture by
the total Ô¨Çux of the star. The result obtained is the ùëò parameter.

2.2.3 Undiluted radius

The analysis of the neighbour stars allows us to evaluate how much
the stellar dilution aÔ¨Äects the candidate‚Äôs transit depth ‚Äì and thus its
radius ‚Äì and whether this value remains consistent with a planetary
object. The equation of the new transit depth is as follows:

with the same notation used in eq. 4, while the candidate‚Äôs new radius
(ùëÖp) can therefore be estimated with the following equation:

2.3 Centroid Motion

(9)

In addition to the on-oÔ¨Ä photometry technique, we performed another
veriÔ¨Åcation test to recognise the presence of contaminating stars.
In particular, we have exploited the so-called centroid motion test,
which monitors the shift in the position of the photometric centroid
during a transit event and veriÔ¨Åes whether the corresponding motion
is pointing away from the target. With this test, we further seek to
determine the location of the transit source and to discard blended
eclipsing binary sources.

In the speciÔ¨Åc case where a TOI was identiÔ¨Åed by the SPOC, we
took the result of the centroid motion test carried out by the TESS
mission ‚Äì that can be found within a TESS Data Validation Report
Ô¨Åle. When this is not the case, we followed the procedure described
in Montalto et al. (2020) to perform the centroid test, and then we ap-
plied the suggested constraints to determine whether a candidate has

source identiÔ¨Åcation PùúÇ, the probability of correct source association
PD, and the Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis 1936).

3 TARGETS SELECTION

To select the candidates orbiting solar-analogue stars, we built an
intrinsic colour-magnitude diagram in the Gaia bands, correcting the
photometry for distance modulus, extinction, and reddening. From
this diagram, it is possible to extrapolate all stars belonging to a
certain spectral class. We focus on solar-analogue stars because of
the scientiÔ¨Åc importance of discovering planets around ‚ÄòSolar twins‚Äô
to carry out future atmospheric follow-up, and to obtain statistical
information about exoplanet systems, whose characteristics may be
similar to our planet, the only one known to host life.

3.1 Intrinsic colour-magnitude diagram

We developed a custom pipeline that takes into account the entire
list of TOIs and then cross-matches it with the MAST, which also
includes Gaia data. Then, we cross-matched the same list with the
asPIC1.1 (Montalto et al. 2021) and used its corrected Gaia DR2
photometry to build an intrinsic colour-magnitude diagram.

3.1.1 The all-sky PLATO input catalogue

4 RESULTS

The intrinsic (i.e., reddening and extinction-free), absolute colour-
magnitude diagram is presented in Figure 2. In the Figure, the V
magnitude (upper panel) and the stellar distance (lower panel) are
colour-coded. This colour-magnitude diagram represents stars across
all the range of spectral types isolated in the asPIC1.1 (FGK and M
dwarfs and subgiant stars), where for FGK stars V ‚â§ 13 and for
M dwarfs V ‚â§ 16. This completeness is important to highlight ‚Äì
especially across the G spectral class ‚Äì since it ensures that we did
not apply any signiÔ¨Åcant bias in our selection.

We found that in a magnitude limited sample, bluer stars ‚Äì being in-
trinsically more luminous ‚Äì tend to be located at larger distances than
redder stars along the main sequence, which are instead found closer
to the observer. Then the larger distance implies a larger distance,
reddening, and extinction uncertainty. This also explains both the
increase in colour and magnitude uncertainty (Fig. 2, lower panel).
Furthermore, the magnitude (and colour) uncertainty tends to in-
crease towards bluer stars. Since interstellar extinction is inversely
proportional to the wavelength (Whitford‚Äôs Law of Interstellar Ex-
tinction, Whitford 1958), bluer stars tend to be more extincted, and
hence the magnitude uncertainty increases. The colour uncertainty
has the same tendency.

3.2 Stellar sample

At this stage, every TOI‚Äôs host star within the asPIC1.1 is ready for
selection. The data is continuously updated and at the time of writing
it, 2022 May 16, the number of TOIs discovered is 5637, of which
2842 are included in the asPIC1.1. We decided to use Mamajek‚Äôs
table (Pecaut & Mamajek 2013) for these TOIs‚Äô host stars. This table
provides average colours and magnitudes (in diÔ¨Äerent pass bands)
for each spectral class and hence allows us to do a selection based
on these average values. We used the photometric magnitudes of the
second9 Gaia data release (corrected for extinction). We chose the
stellar classes from F9V to G8V, providing almost seven hundred
target stars to be analysed. The choice to use this range of stellar
subclasses is arbitrary, but motivated by the colour and magnitude
parameters of its two extremities, which are almost equally separated
from the parameters of the Sun. Furthermore, both the F9V and the
G8V subclasses diÔ¨Äers by about ¬± 300K from the eÔ¨Äective temper-
ature of the Sun. Expanding the range at each end with only one
subclass would imply an expansion into the eÔ¨Äective temperature
range of ¬± 120K, which is equivalent to a total range expansion of ‚âà
40%. After this selection, we considered only TOIs currently deÔ¨Åned
by the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) working group
as Planet Candidate (PC) or whose deÔ¨Ånition10 is still absent. We
also excluded from our analysis each TOI for which time-series or
high-precision RV follow-up observations were already available and
all TOIs currently under investigation by the ExoFop-TESS website.
In total, after discarding single-transit candidates, 158 TOIs survived
within our selection.

Here we report the result of the validation procedure for 158 TOIs
orbiting solar-analogue stars analysed using the vespa code. In the
following subsections, we present the statistical outputs coming from
this calculation.

4.1 Stellar Parameters

The vespa code relies on the Isochrones package to infer physical
properties of a TESS star. Isochrones uses a nested sampling scheme
given photometric, spectroscopic, and other observational constraints
(see Section 2.1.1). Stellar properties are crucial for estimating the
FPP (Shporer et al. 2017). If the Isochrones estimates agree with
literature values, the resulting FPP becomes more reliable.

We compared the stellar parameters simulated in this work with
those determined for asPIC1.1 by inspecting the diÔ¨Äerence in their
values:

Œîùë•ùëñ = ùë•ùëñ,vespa ‚àí ùë•ùëñ,PIC,

(11)

where ùë•ùëñ and ùúéùëñ are the value and standard deviation of a given stellar
parameter ùëñ respectively, with ùëñ = {mass, radius, ùëáeÔ¨Ä, distance}.

To perform the comparison, we used stellar parameters from the
Isochrones single-star Ô¨Åt when the planetary or BEB scenario was
the most likely; otherwise, we used those from either the double-
(EB scenario) or triple-star model (HEB scenario). We have always
used the stellar parameters of the primary star, both in the case of a
single- and a multiple-star system. When vespa simulates the BEB
scenario, it does not use stellar parameters from the Isochrones
star models; instead, it performs a TRILEGAL simulation (Girardi
et al. 2005) to generate a population of eclipsing binary stars in the
neighbourhood of the TESS target under examination. The source of
the transit signal becomes one of these neighbourhood stars; hence,
the simulated stellar parameters that have been generated are diÔ¨Äerent
from those of our selected target star. However, we aim to verify
the vespa-simulated stellar parameters of our TESS star speciÔ¨Åcally
selected and not one of its neighbour stars. Therefore, we made use of
stellar parameters from the Isochrones single-star model that have
been used to evaluate the planetary scenario, regardless of whether
vespa identiÔ¨Åed the BEB-scenario to be most likely.

Figure 3 shows the diÔ¨Äerence Œîùë•ùëñ between the two measures versus
the asPIC1.1 stellar parameter ùë•ùëñ,PIC. We omitted stars with |Œîùë•ùëñ | >
3ùúéŒîùë•ùëñ

from our analysis.

As we can see in Fig. 3, we found that almost all vespa-simulated
host stars have parameters in agreement with those estimated in the
asPIC1.1 input catalogue; and, aside from four particular ‚Äòsingle‚Äô
star cases (see below), for every star outside 3ùúé conÔ¨Ådence inter-
val vespa found the BEB (or EB) scenario to be the most likely.
We also noted the presence of a small systematic oÔ¨Äset on stellar
masses, which is probably due to the diÔ¨Äerent empiric relationships
or models adopted by asPIC1.1 and Isochrones. By the analysis of
the individual targets, we see that:

9 Although Gaia EDR3 is now available, we used Gaia DR2 in our stellar
selection because both the asPIC1.1 and Mamajek‚Äôs table are based on this
Gaia release.
10 We extracted the dispositions from the ‚ÄòTFOPWG Disposition‚Äô entry avail-
able on the ExoFOP-TESS website.

‚Ä¢ the candidates we statistically vetted (see Sect. 4.3) orbit a star

whose simulated parameters agree with the asPIC1.1 ones;

‚Ä¢ stars with a stellar parameter ùëñ with |Œîùë•ùëñ | > 3ùúéŒîùë•ùëñ

usually also
have one (or more) other stellar parameters that follow this char-
acteristic, which means that nine target stars had to be discarded
from our analysis;

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2021)

‚Ä¢ stars outside 3ùúé conÔ¨Ådence interval almost often had large maxAV
and/or Œîùúå/ùúå values in the vespa input Ô¨Åles. This was the case for
three of the four ‚Äòsingle‚Äô stars outside 3ùúé conÔ¨Ådence interval. The
large maxAV value in the vespa input Ô¨Åles ‚Äì that we noticed being
quite often underestimated in the consecutive vespa simulation of
these stars ‚Äì could explain both the diÔ¨Äerences in stellar ùëáeÔ¨Ä and
ùëÄ. On the other hand, the large Œîùúå/ùúå values could explain some
of the stars with large vespa-simulated stellar radius ùëÖ and mass
ùëÄ;

‚Ä¢ the remaining unexplained ‚Äòsingle‚Äô star was modelled by
Isochrones but the resulting Ô¨Åt led to erroneous posterior stellar
parameters.

4.2 False Positive Probability

Among the entire selected sample, vespa was unable to evaluate
some candidates due to problems related to the geometry of their
orbital conÔ¨Åguration or to diÔ¨Éculties in modelling their light curves
(see Section 4.6). This happened in the most diÔ¨Écult cases, where
the signal/noise ratio was very low. Therefore, the results we present
here do not take them into account. Considering this removal plus the
stars omitted in the previous section, we remain with 128 TOIs with
usable light curves and reliable parameters. Among them, there are 23
candidates with a very high probability of being transiting planets,
while almost 45 per cent of the entire sample have probability of
being an FP that exceed 50 per cent (Fig. 4). Among the FPs, there
are 26 candidates with FPP > 90%. The remaining 48 candidates
have an FPP with an intermediate value and their true transit nature
requires further analysis to be conÔ¨Årmed. The histogram in Figure
5 illustrates the FPP distribution of our candidates. In particular, it
is possible to note that the FPP covers nearly the full 0-100 per cent
probability range, with a higher concentration at the two extremes of
the distribution. Another important result concerns the FP scenario
that appears to be the most recurrent one, i.e., not necessarily the one
with a probability that exceed 50 per cent, but the one with the highest
probability among all the scenarios analysed. As we can see from
the pie chart in Figure 6, the Background (or Foreground) Eclipsing
Binary (BEB) is the main cause of FPs. This result is consistent with
the expectations of the TESS mission, for which the main cause of FPs
is expected to be the BEB scenario (Ricker et al. 2015). This is caused
by the crowding of stars within the TESS photometric aperture, as
a result of the large pixel size and the overall PSF area. In fact,
having many light sources in the same photometric area may dilute
the brightness of the observed source and increase the FP probability
due to blended eclipsing binaries.

4.3 Vetted candidates

To claim a statistical vetting for a transiting exoplanet candidate,
we considered the FPP < 1% threshold, as was done by Morton
et al. (2016). The number of candidates orbiting solar-analogue stars
that satisfy this limit is 23, which corresponds to 18 per cent of TOIs
within our selection (complete list in Table A1). Then, we subdivided
the entire sample of statistically vetted candidates in Ô¨Åve arbitrary
planet-size bins:

‚Ä¢ Terrestrials: ùëÖ ùëù (cid:54) 2 ùëÖ‚äï;
‚Ä¢ Sub-Neptunes: 2ùëÖ‚äï < ùëÖ ùëù (cid:54) 4 ùëÖ‚äï;
‚Ä¢ Sub-Jovians: 4ùëÖ‚äï < ùëÖ ùëù (cid:54) 10 ùëÖ‚äï;
‚Ä¢ Jovians: 10ùëÖ‚äï < ùëÖ ùëù (cid:54) 25 ùëÖ‚äï;
‚Ä¢ Stellar objects: ùëÖ ùëù (cid:62) 25 ùëÖ‚äï,

to determine which kind of exoplanets we found. For each candidate,
we considered two diÔ¨Äerent values for their planetary radius. First
of all, we took into account the radius estimated by the TESS mis-
sion (Stassun et al. 2019). Then, we considered our estimated radius,
which we obtained after performing a correction for the stellar di-
lution (see Sec. 2.2.3). In Figure 7 we show the planetary radii of
our sample of vetted candidates and its distribution. We added Ô¨Åve
shaded areas to highlight diÔ¨Äerent planet-size bins. We can note the
presence of one terrestrial-size exoplanet and the high concentration
of Sub-Neptunes and Jovian-size candidates. At small radii, our esti-
mated radii are quite similar to those coming from the TESS mission,
while they are often larger than the other estimate when the planetary
radii are in the Jovian-size bin. The diÔ¨Äerence between our radii and
the ones estimated by the TESS mission might be due to the points
highlighted in Sec. 2.2.3 and may depend only on how the stellar
dilution is treated (i.e., there is no dependence on the stellar radius).
The two estimates are diÔ¨Äerent (i.e., their diÔ¨Äerence is greater than
1ùúé) for ‚âà 17 per cent of the vetted candidates. We noticed that each
of these vetted candidates is in the Jovians size bin and has been
identiÔ¨Åed with the QLP pipeline. It is worth being aware of this dif-
ference. In fact, not only the planet-size bin could be diÔ¨Äerent, but
also the planetary nature of a candidate could become questionable if
its radius reaches a speciÔ¨Åc value. We chose an arbitrary upper limit
of 25 ùëÖ‚äï for a sub-stellar object, as the largest conÔ¨Årmed transiting
exoplanet discovered so far has a similar size11 (Zhou et al. 2017).
We conÔ¨Årm that each of our vetted candidates has a sub-stellar radius.

4.4 Vetted candidates conÔ¨Årmed to orbit their host star

Following the procedure described in Section 2.2, we took advantage
of Gaia EDR3 photometry to accurately analyse the stellar neigh-
bourhood of each vetted candidate. In this way, we were able to check
whether any neighbourhood star could mimic the detected transit sig-
nal and successively exclude each Gaia source as a possible BEB.
This procedure allowed us to narrow the transit source origin of ten
vetted candidates (see Section 5.1 and Table A1) within 1.5 arcsec-
onds separation from their host star. For the other 13 candidates,
we have not been able to narrow down the location of the source of
their signal. However, we have identiÔ¨Åed which neighbourhood stars
might be a contaminant source and how deep their transit signal is.

4.4.1 Centroid motion results

As additional evidence of the transit source origin of our vetted
candidates, we considered the centroid motion test (see Section 2.3).
In Table A1 ‚Äì in the centroid test column ‚Äì we show the results
of this examination. Aside from a controversial case12, every vetted
candidate whose on-target probability has been greatly enhanced ‚Äì
with our Gaia photometry analysis (see Section 2.2) ‚Äì has passed the
centroid motion test. Figure 8 presents an example of a test passed and
one of a test failed. Summing the results of this analysis with those
obtained using Gaia photometry, we greatly enhanced the on-target
probability of 12 vetted candidates.

to rule out unresolved neighbour stars beyond the 1.5 arcseconds spa-
tial resolution of Gaia EDR3. Summing the information gained with

‚Ä¢ the observed on-oÔ¨Ä variations present large error bars;
‚Ä¢ we shortened both sides of the window length of TOI 3353.01‚Äôs
on-transit phase only by 1ùúé (see Sec. 2.2) because we were limited
by the length of the data we had;

‚Ä¢ when using REM images taken using the Sloan/SDSS i(cid:48) Ô¨Ålter,
the observed on-oÔ¨Ä variation of the neighbourhood star does not
reproduce the discovery signal of TOI 3353.01;

‚Ä¢ the target star is active and is also saturated in the REM photom-
etry. These two aspects could aÔ¨Äect the on-oÔ¨Ä photometry of the
considered neighbourhood star, which is only 22 arcseconds far
from the target;

‚Ä¢ there are no available data on the potential activity of Gaia EDR3
5212899427468921088. If this contaminating star were intrinsi-
cally variable, on-oÔ¨Ä photometry could give a ‚Äòfalse negative‚Äô;
‚Ä¢ the orbital periods of TOI 3353.01 and TOI 3353.02 are not in
phase with each other. We expect a 2:1 period commensurability
if both transit were due to the same background eclipsing binary.

Moreover, we independently reanalysed the TESS light curves of TOI
3353.01 and TOI 3353.02, and modelled them using the pycheops
code (Maxted et al. 2021), to extrapolate the host star‚Äôs stellar density
ùúå‚àó,‚Ñé from the transit signals. We followed equations 27 and 30 from
Winn (2010), and then ran MCMC simulations to better estimate the
value and uncertainty of ùúå‚àó,‚Ñé. We compared ùúå‚àó,‚Ñé with the nominal
stellar density ùúå‚àó, i.e., the one calculated from the stellar radius ùëÖ‚àó
and mass ùëÄ‚àó. Furthermore, we performed the same analysis focusing
on the contaminant star, to determine if the resulting stellar density
ùúå‚àó,ùëê could better match the nominal value of the contaminant star.
To do so, we injected the ‚Äòthird light‚Äô parameter (l_3 in pycheops)
into the pycheops modelling procedure, and treated the target star
as the ‚Äòthird light‚Äô for the hypothetical transits in the contaminant.
These analyses show that:

‚Ä¢ the resulting stellar density ùúå‚àó,‚Ñé leads to values in agreement with
the nominal stellar density ùúå‚àó = 0.94 ¬± 0.18ùúå(cid:12) of the host star.
In particular, we obtained ùúå‚àó,‚Ñé = 0.69 ¬± 0.23ùúå(cid:12) and ùúå‚àó,‚Ñé =
0.91 ¬± 0.36ùúå(cid:12), for TOI 3353.01 and TOI 3353.02, respectively;
‚Ä¢ the resulting stellar density ùúå‚àó,ùëê leads to values larger than
ùúå(cid:12), which are not consistent with the nominal stellar density
ùúå‚àó = 0.24ùúå(cid:12) of the contaminant star. Given the large magnitude
diÔ¨Äerence between the host and the contaminant star, treating the
target as the ‚Äòthird light‚Äô for the hypothetical transits in the contam-
inant leads the model to produce transits so deep that the occulting
body has to be very large. This is contradicted by the observations,
where the short duration of ingress and egress mandates a much
smaller body.

These considerations imply that the results of our on-oÔ¨Ä analysis
are not accurate enough to conÔ¨Årm the source of transit signals or
detect the source of contamination. We can also rule out the physical
scenario of a contaminating eclipsing binary capable of explaining
both transiting candidates. Moreover, through the analysis of stellar
density from both transit models, we have reasons to believe that
TOI 3353 is a genuine multi-planetary system. Regardless of the
latter result, we emphasise that further photometric observations are
crucial to shed light on the true nature of these two candidates. In
particular, we suggest performing full-transit photometric observa-
tions and focusing attention on the neighbourhood star Gaia EDR3
5212899427468921088.

4.5 On-oÔ¨Ä photometry observations

To perform the on-oÔ¨Ä photometry follow-up of our statistically vetted
candidates (i.e., those from Sec. 4.3), we have submitted an obser-
vational proposal to INAF AOT44 call (October 1st 2021 - March
31st, 2022, proposal REM-44018, P.I. Giacomo Mantovan), to col-
lect multi-band REM images (Chincarini et al. 2003; Molinari et al.
2004). Located in La Silla, Chile, the REM telescope allows us to
observe mainly the TESS candidates detected in the southern hemi-
sphere.

Thanks to these observations, we found that two candidates may
be false positives. In particular, our analysis shows that both the
transits of TOI 3353.01 and TOI 3353.02 could be due to a back-
ground eclipsing binary. In fact, Gaia EDR3 5212899427468921088
‚Äì a neighbourhood star of TOI 3353 ‚Äì reproduces both the discovery
signals (Fig. 9). The magnitude variation has been calculated averag-
ing the Ô¨Çux measured in several images during both the on- and oÔ¨Ä-
transit phases, and correcting for systematic variations (i.e., diÔ¨Äerent
on- and oÔ¨Ä- zero point of magnitude due to diÔ¨Äerent sky conditions
occurring during the two phases). In addition, our procedure, which
is a diÔ¨Äerential, aperture, transit photometry, removes most system-
atic trends, whereas we point out that some residual trends may still
be present due to the individual, averaged, on-oÔ¨Ä measurement. We
analysed REM images taken using the Sloan/SDSS g(cid:48) Ô¨Ålter and also
the Sloan/SDSS i(cid:48) Ô¨Ålter, which allow us to perform a follow-up with
an observation band similar to TESS (Ricker et al. 2015). The ob-
served ‚Äì and averaged ‚Äì on-oÔ¨Ä magnitude variation is comparable
to the estimated one (eq. 6). In addition to our analysis, the centroid
motion tests carried out by the TESS mission was unclear for both
candidates, further suggesting a possible contamination. Moreover,
the TESS team ‚Äì in a note present on the ExoFOP TESS website ‚Äì
alerted the possible contamination for TOI 3353.02 exactly from the
neighbour star we found.

Even though this result may seem reasonable and a lot of data
suggests stellar contamination, we have reason to believe that this is
a misleading result:

4.6 Problematic cases

5.1 Follow-up observations

The vespa code was unable to evaluate 21 candidates orbiting solar-
analogue stars within our sample. In more detail:

(i) Three candidates have orbital period and simulated stellar
properties that imply their orbit to be within their host star‚Äôs
Roche limit. vespa considers this situation as a FP;

(ii) Eight TOIs did receive MCMC modelling but the trapezoidal
Ô¨Åtting model was not able to Ô¨Åt the transit signal. All these
candidates have a very low signal/noise ratio;

(iii) The trapezoid MCMC Ô¨Åt did not converge for one candidate;
(iv) Nine TOIs have no light-curve publicly-available on the MAST

portal.

5 DISCUSSION

The validation process is a fundamental part of a more complex work,
which aims to identify false positives and exclude them to obtain a
cleaner sample of candidates, leading to the Ô¨Ånal conÔ¨Årmation of
an exoplanet candidate. Thanks to this procedure, we can eliminate
most of the false candidates, and proceed with the follow-up obser-
vations up to the radial velocity measurement, which allows the full
characterisation of a planetary system. Only after the radial velocity
procedure, it is possible to conÔ¨Årm an exoplanet candidate.

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2021)

In this work, we statistically vetted 23 TESS candidates orbiting solar-
analogue stars and subsequently analysed their stellar neighbourhood
to investigate the presence of possible contaminant stars, conÔ¨Årming
the transit source origin of six of them and greatly enhancing the
on-target probability of another six of them. These two steps allow
us to determine which are the best targets and which are the next
follow-up observations required to fully conÔ¨Årm and characterise
their planetary nature.

For some of our targets, the high-resolution spectra of their host
stars are available in public archives, and these are listed in detail in
Table A2. If the name of the host star is duplicated, it shows that there
are more than one instrument that has obtained the spectrum of the
host star. All these instruments have been included in Table A2. For
some of our targets, there are RV measurements performed with low-
resolution spectroscopy. However, we do not report on the spectra
obtained with those instruments but only the ‚ÄòOpen Observing Notes‚Äô
on these RV measurements that are publicly available on the ExoFOP
website. It should be noted that, however, there are no high-precision
RV measurements reported for any of these stars, which would lead
to conÔ¨Årming or ruling out an exoplanet candidate.

Depending on which instrument has published the spectra, and
with what spectral coverage and resolution, the next steps for follow-
up on our targets will be determined. For our targets, as incorporated
and speciÔ¨Åed in Table A2, the available spectra are obtained with
TRES (Szentgyorgyi & Fur√©sz 2007) (resolution ‚àº 44000), FIDEOS
(Tala et al. 2014) (resolution ‚àº 43000), and CHIRON (Tokovinin

and derive planet masses. We hence focus on RV follow-up strategies
that have not been yet conducted for our targets.

Low-precision RV measurements are necessary to reject grazing
eclipsing binaries or transiting massive white and brown dwarfs,
which can not be identiÔ¨Åed through the transit method. It is also
essential because often the presence of a stellar body can be ruled
out after taking three radial velocity observations. This aim can be
fulÔ¨Ålled by either TRES or FIDEOS, as listed in Table A2. In fact,
TRES and FIDEOS are usually used for identifying the nature of the
transiting objects or ruling out false positives (a technique known as
reconnaissance spectroscopy). Any candidate that will survive this
test will become an exquisite target for internal structure and atmo-
spheric characterisation through high-precision RV measurements,
which can be conducted by higher resolution spectrometers ‚Äì that
conÔ¨Årm exoplanet candidates by determining their masses ‚Äì such as
CHIRON.

5.1.1 DeÔ¨Ånition of ‚Äòstatistically validated planets‚Äô and priority

marks

Considering all the above points and state-of-the-art planet validation
papers, we recognise some TOIs investigated in this work as fully
‚Äòstatistically validated planets‚Äô. For such TOIs we have added a small
letter planet suÔ¨Éx (e.g., ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô) which takes the place of .01/.02
previously present (see Table A1). Any other TOI investigated in
this work is instead referred to as ‚Äòvetted‚Äô. In particular, only TOIs
meeting the following criteria should be given a planet suÔ¨Éx:

‚Ä¢ The transit signal has been conÔ¨Årmed to be on-target (i.e., relative
to a maxrad area that contains no known neighbouring stars bright
enough to cause the event, including Adaptive Optics/Speckle
neighbours);

instrument, diÔ¨Äerent follow-up paths should be pursued for each of
our targets, as we will detail later in this Section. It should be noted,
however, that RV conÔ¨Årmation requires resource-intensive long-term
monitoring programs. On ExoFOP catalogue, all the spectra obtained
by CHIRON (which have the highest resolution in Table A2) for our
targets are Ô¨Çagged as not appropriate to precision RV (PRV), which is
necessary for directly measure the stellar reÔ¨Çex motion due to planets

‚Ä¢ Host star spectroscopy should not be suggestive of a composite
spectrum, a large RV oÔ¨Äset indicative of an EB, or an RV orbit
that is out-of-phase with the photometric ephemeris;

‚Ä¢ The TOI should have a well sampled transit shape (i.e., high photo-
metric precision, high number of transits observed, short cadence
sampling or transits very deep) to be used for the statistical vali-
dation;

‚Ä¢ The TOI has been probabilistically vetted with FPP < 0.01;
‚Ä¢ The TOI has a uniquely determined orbital period.

Moreover, here we suggest a priority mark to establish what the
next step is for the Ô¨Åve statistically validated planets and the 18
exoplanet candidates vetted in this paper (see Table A1):

‚Ä¢ Mark = 1: candidate with greatly enhanced on-target probabil-
ity, and both low-precision RV measurements and high-resolution
imaging data are already available. High-precision RV observa-
tions should be conducted;

‚Ä¢ Mark = 2: candidate with greatly enhanced on-target probability,
and low-precision RV measurements are already available. High-
resolution Adaptive Optics/Speckle imaging observations should
be conducted;

‚Ä¢ Mark = 3: candidate with greatly enhanced on-target probability,
but no (or not enough) RV measurements are available. We suggest
performing low-precision RV observations;

‚Ä¢ Mark = 4: candidate whose on-target probability is low or unclear.

We suggest to perform on-oÔ¨Ä photometry observations.

5.2 Statistical validation reliability

We acknowledge that our statistical validation analysis strongly relies
on the stellar neighbourhood analysis. In our calculation, we have
added a constraint (maxrad) to account for the probability that the
transit originates from the target. However, the use of Gaia EDR3
photometry, centroid motion tests or subsequent on-oÔ¨Ä analyses is
necessary to give 100 per cent reliability to our results. Moreover,
high-resolution imaging follow-ups are needed to rule out unresolved
neighbour stars beyond the 1.5 arcseconds spatial resolution of Gaia
EDR3. In fact, if all neighbour stars are not adequately ruled out as
transit sources prior to the analysis, vespa could classify false positive
candidates as true planets (Giacalone et al. 2020; Morton et al. 2016).
For this reason, we performed the Gaia EDR3 photometry analysis
and the centroid motion tests before starting the vespa code, and
we checked the high-resolution imaging data publicly available on
the ExoFOP website. We require subsequent on-oÔ¨Ä analyses for those

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì14 (2021)

candidates not yet conÔ¨Årmed orbiting their host star. This emphasises
the importance of careful consideration of potential contamination
from the host star‚Äôs neighbourhood (see, for example, the notes in
Table A1 on the on-target probability of TOI 1689.01), then precisely
following the priority marks we have suggested (Sect. 5.1) to fully
validate and later conÔ¨Årm our target exoplanets. We emphasize that
our candidates with Mark = 1 are fully validated planets and ready
to be conÔ¨Årmed.

In contrast, the maxrad constraint that we have adopted enhances ‚Äì
by construction ‚Äì the probability of the BEB scenario, and hence the
total FPP of a candidate (also noted by De Leon et al. 2021). There-
fore, we can only identify the planetary candidate after excluding the
BEB scenario through a complete analysis of the stellar neighbour-
hood. This is for example the case of TOI 4399.01, which was Ô¨Årst
identiÔ¨Åed by vespa as a possible BEB and then as a likely planet
after ruling out contaminant stars using Gaia EDR3 photometry.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Here we presented our ongoing follow-up program of TESS can-
didates orbiting solar-analogue stars that are in the all-sky PLATO
input catalogue. Our probabilistic validation analysis allows us to
identify which are the most promising candidates, while the evalu-
ation of their stellar neighbourhood determines which are the next
follow-up observations needed to conÔ¨Årm their exoplanet nature. The
Ô¨Ånal goal of the entire procedure is to avoid wasting observational
time at expensive facilities and optimize follow-up resources. In par-
ticular, we statistically vetted 23 TESS candidates orbiting solar-
analogue stars. Five of them have been conÔ¨Årmed on-target and are
ready for follow-up high-precision radial velocity observations (we
refer to them as ‚Äòstatistically validated planets‚Äô), another three have
a greatly enhanced on-target probability and need high-resolution
imaging data, while the others need additional spectroscopic and/or
photometric observations (see Table A1, column ‚ÄòPriority & obs.‚Äô).
It is worth noting that these are new discoveries. We will continue
to search for new validated planets at least as long as the TESS
mission will continue. In the very near future, we will complete
the on-oÔ¨Ä photometry follow-up of our best targets, by proposing
further investigation with REM and other telescopes, as well as
low-precision radial velocity observations. This will allow us to
extend the sample of vetted candidates and hence the number of
genuine targets to be later characterized through high-precision
radial velocity observations. Similarly to TESS, the future PLATO
transit mission (Rauer et al. 2014) will have a low spatial resolution
(15 arcsec/pixel, Laubier et al. 2017); hence, it will also require a
quick and eÔ¨Écient statistical validation procedure to exclude false
positives from the large number of candidates that PLATO will
discover. To conclude, our validation procedure will be essential and
should be rather easily adaptable to the future PLATO mission.

The authors became aware of the conÔ¨Årmation of TOI 4399 b
(Zhou et al. 2022) during the referee process. This independent work
veriÔ¨Åes our process by conÔ¨Årming one of our Ô¨Åve validated planets.
Moreover, we want to bring attention to the follow-up work of TOI-
5398 on TRES by Jiayin Dong et al. (private communication), which
allowed the establishment of a tentative orbit. This independent work
further demonstrates that our method Ô¨Ånds good targets for follow-up.

APPENDIX A: SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES

APPENDIX B: DUO-TRANSIT CANDIDATE VETTING

The TESS candidate TOI 4361.01 is one of our vetted candidates
with the second highest priority mark, which means that following
our procedure, we demonstrated that it is ready to be analysed with
high-resolution imaging and subsequently conÔ¨Årmed through high-
precision radial velocity observations. However, there is a large gap in
the TESS data that causes its period ùëÉ of ‚âà741 days to be ambiguous.
The absence of a period uniquely constrained induces us to be careful
and requires further analysis to conÔ¨Årm its vetting. Therefore, we
performed the following:

(i) We took into account all possible TOI 4361.01 period aliases,
and modelled the TESS light curve using the pycheops code,
to extrapolate the host star‚Äôs stellar density ùúå from the transit
signal (see Sec. 4.5). We then ran an MCMC simulation to
better estimate the value and the uncertainty of ùúå;

(ii) we considered all the aliases whose extrapolated ùúå has a physi-
cal result and performed, again, the vespa analysis considering
the new period.

In Figure B1, we illustrate the results. In particular, we show the
stellar density ùúå coming from the possible aliases as a function of
the period aliases. We added the nominal stellar density available on
the ExoFOP website for comparison. The lower limit on the orbital
period comes from the ephemeris window covered by the TESS
mission during sectors 8 and 35, while the upper limit comes from
the light curve modelling, where we Ô¨Åxed the transit duration as
reported on the ExoFOP website. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, when a period alias
is (cid:39) 35.5 days, the impact parameter ùëè (calculating following Eq. 7
from Winn 2010 and considering a circular orbit) becomes > 1 (not
physically allowed). These two limits constrain the period aliases to
be within [ùëÉ/34, ùëÉ/21]. The assumption of a circular orbit avoids
the treatment of eccentricity in the evaluation of impact parameter
and the consequent degeneracy in the pycheops transit modelling.
Although the latter assumption is simplistic, the results of exoplanet
population studies, especially for low-mass, sub-Neptunes planets,
favour low eccentricities values (Mayor et al. 2011; Kane et al. 2012;
Kipping 2013). From the results of this Ô¨Ågure, we conclude that
whilst this approach could yield a unique orbital period, we do not
have the sampling in the transit ingress/egress to accurately say what
it is. However, we emphasise that the unique orbital period estimation
is not the central goal of this appendix and this work.

Following the result of our analysis, we performed the vespa anal-
ysis of every survived TOI 4361.01 period alias. Moreover, for the
sake of completeness, we also considered some period aliases (ùëÉ/2,
ùëÉ/4, ùëÉ/8, and ùëÉ/16) outside the aforementioned limits. In conclusion,
we have found the following:

ùëè Maximum secondary eclipse depth allowed.
ùëê Exclusion radius within which FP scenarios are allowed.

‚Ñé TOI 4361.01 is a ‚Äòduo-transit‚Äô candidate, i.e., a TOI with only two transits separated by about two years. Therefore, its period is not uniquely constrained but
somewhat ambiguous. However, as further explained in Appendix B, we have reasons to keep it as a vetted candidate regardless of its uncertain periodicity.
ùëñ The TESS planetary radius R ùëù,TESS has been calculated, in this work, from the transit depth available on the ExoFOP website and eq. 22 from Winn (2010).
We did the latter to maintain consistency with R ùëù,vespa & R ùëù,undil., which were both calculated with the ExoFOP transit depth as a prior parameter.
ùëó TOI 3353.01 and TOI 3353.02 have high-resolution speckle imaging publicly available on the ExoFOP website (PI: Howell). Following Morton (2012) and
the vespa tutorial, we inserted the Gemini/Zorro contrast curves into the vespa input parameters. The Ô¨Ånal FPP of TOI 3353.01 slightly increases (reaching a
value of 1e-6), while that of TOI 3353.02 remains unchanged. This result further conÔ¨Årms our statistical vetting. TOI 2545.01, TOI 4399.01, and TOI 4443.02
also have high-resolution speckle (or Adaptive Optics) imaging publicly available on the ExoFOP website (PI: Dressing, Howell, and Ciardi, respectively). The
Ô¨Ånal FPP of TOI 2545.01 remains the same, while the FPP of every other TOIs decreases from two to seven orders of magnitude. Also in this case, our vettings
are conÔ¨Årmed. This analysis allowed us to validate TOI 2545.01 and TOI 4399.01 and label them as TOI 2545 b and TOI 4399 b.
ùëò Companion detected at 0.08 arcseconds separation using high-resolution speckle imaging (Dr. Boris Safonov, from exofop.ipac.caltech.edu). New
imaging data has been scheduled, and new analyses of existing data are also in progress (Dr. Boris Safonov, private communication). Additional information is
available in Table A2.

Notes.
ùëé Summary of the ‚ÄòOpen Observing Notes‚Äô publicly available on the ExoFOP website.
ùëè ‚ÄòThe new TRES observation is very strong and is shifted by about 3 km/s compared to the Ô¨Årst two TRES observations more than a year ago. Moreover, there
is more line broadening, hinting at a composite spectrum. This is not a good target for PRV work or atmospheric characterization. No more TRES recon spectra
are needed.‚Äô (Dr. David Latham, from exofop.ipac.caltech.edu).
ùëê Data publicly available on the ExoFOP website and further analysed by Zhou et al. (2022).
ùëë This conclusion comes from the ‚ÄòOpen Observing Notes‚Äô and private communication with Dr. David Latham.
