ABSTRACT 

Impact-sounding (IS) and impact-echo (IE) are  well-developed non-destructive 
evaluation (NDE) methods that are widely used for inspections of concrete structures to 
ensure the safety and sustainability. However, it is a tedious work to collect IS and IE 
data along grid lines covering a large target area for characterization of subsurface 
defects. On the other hand, data processing is very complicated that requires domain 
experts to interpret the results. To address the above problems, we present a novel 
robotic  inspection  system  named  as  Impact-Rover  to  automate  the  data  collection 
process and introduce data analytics software to visualize the inspection result allowing 
regular non-professional people to understand. The system consists of three modules: 
1) a robotic platform with vertical mobility to collect IS and IE data in hard-to-reach
locations, 2) vision-based positioning module that fuses the RGB-D camera, IMU and
wheel encoder to estimate the 6-DOF pose of the robot, 3) a data analytics software
module for processing the IS data to generate defect maps. The Impact-Rover hosts both
IE  and  IS  devices  on  a  sliding  mechanism  and  can  perform  move-stop-sample
operations to collect multiple IS and IE data at adjustable spacing. The robot takes
samples much faster than the manual data collection method because it automatically
takes the multiple measurements along a straight line and records the locations. This
paper focuses on reporting experimental results on IS. We calculate features and use
unsupervised learning methods for analyzing the data. By combining the pose generated
by our vision-based localization module and the position of the head of the sliding
mechanism we can generate maps of possible defects. The results on concrete slabs
demonstrate that our impact-sounding system can effectively reveal shallow defects.

According to this report there are more than 617,000 bridges and 42% of them are over 
50 years old, with 7.5% of them considered to be in a poor condition or structurally 
deficient. Condition of bridges is graded with C, a decrease from C+ from the ASCE 
2017 report card. It is critically important to increase the inspection frequency so we can 
detect  and  repair  the  defects  before  any  additional  deterioration  damages  these 
structures beyond the repair point. The inspection of infrastructure is a time-consuming, 
expensive  and  potentially  a  dangerous  process.  Inspectors  use  NDT  methods  like 
impact-echo [1], acoustic inspection [2], ultrasonic [3], GPR [4], visual inspection [5] 
etc.,  to  detect  defects  like  cracks,  delamination,  voids,  rebar  corrosion  etc.  GPR 
[15][16],  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used  methods  in  detecting  defects  like  voids, 
delamination,  buried  objects  and  metallic  rebars  [6],  corrosion  [7]  etc.  Impact-echo 
method  is  used  to  detect  delamination,  cracks  and  voids  in  concrete  structures  [1]. 
However,  impact-echo  although  successful  still  lacks  any  good  result  for  shallow 
delamination [8].  

The  focus  of  this  paper  is  detection  of  shallow  defects  using  automated  robotic 
impact-sounding and generation of high-resolution maps. First, an automated robotic 
solution  with  wall-climbing  capabilities  is  developed.  This  automated  solution 
drastically decreases the necessary time to collect data, improves the data consistency 
so  all  data  points  are  collected  under  very  similar  condition,  and  finally  frees  the 
inspectors from the tedious task of collecting data manually. Second, we use FFT [9] to 
extract features out of the raw sound files. We show that by using other features other 
than just frequency peaks, we can use very noisy sound recordings recorded with an 
affordable microphone, without any physical filter required, and are able to detect voids 
and delamination in the concrete slab. This paper is potentially impactful, because we 
use K-Means [10] and Spectral Clustering [26] to analyze the data and we get very good 
results.  

ROBOTIC IMPACT-SOUNDING SYSTEM 

Robotic System and Software 

We developed a robotic inspection system with vertical mobility which is called 

Impact-Rover (see Figure 1). The robot consists of two DC brushless motors for  

Figure 1. Impact-Rover robot and hardware system.

calculated. We generate feature maps and perform PCA. Both PCA results and features go into 
clustering algorithms which generate segmented maps. PCA maps are also very informative to define 
the cluster properties. 

differential drive locomotion, suction motor for climbing on concrete walls, a solenoid 
impactor  on  a  sliding  mechanism  that  is  controlled  by  a  stepper  motor,  specially 
designed embedded system control board, accelerometer with data acquisition module 
for IE, a microphone for IS, RealSense D435i RGBD camera for localization and Intel 
NUC on-board computer. Impact-Rover can collect data automatically in a pre-defined 
area.  

Impact-Sounding and Impact-Echo Modules 

The  impact-sounding  module  consist  of  an  Olson  Solenoid  for  generating  the 
impact. This solenoid can tap the surface and provide 0.011 to 0.019 Joules per hit. 
Sound data are recorded using 3.5 mm standard microphone. IS and IE devices both rest 
on the sliding mechanism to collect data at an adjustable spacing. 

The IE module consist of three important parts. An accelerometer from PCB Inc. 
with sensitivity of 100 mV/g, frequency range (±3 dB) 0.5 to 20 kHz. Digital ICP Signal 
Conditioner Model 485B39 which connects through USB port and is used to transfer 
the data to the on-board computer. The servo motor is used to lower the IE transducer 
up and down to be in contact with the concrete surface for taking measurements. 

Localization Module 

In order to automate the data collection process, we need to determine the location 
of the robot with respect to the starting point and displacement of IE and IS sensors on 
the  sliding  mechanism.  This  way  we  can  tag  each  measurement  with  position 
information. We use RealSense RGBD camera D435i to estimate the pose [11][12][13] 
[14] and then fuse it with wheel’s encoders to improve the localization accuracy of the
robot.

IMPACT-SOUNDING BASED INSPECTION 

Data Processing and Feature Engineering 

Due  to  the  nature  of  the  data  and  from  our  previous  research  experience 
[12][17][18], we decided to use discrete Fourier Transform [19] or frequency domain 
analysis.  This  method  decomposes  the  signal  "($),  where  $ = 1, 2, … , + − 1  into 
spectral  components  and  provides  frequency  information  (see  Equation  1).  Thus, 
inputting a sound signal into Fourier Transform process, as output we get a function in 
the complex domain. This function represents the amount of each frequency present in 
the  original  signal.  We  perform  Fast  Fourier  Transform  (FFT)  [20]  on  all  impact-
sounding data we collected. For each sound signal we obtain the pair {.!, /!}, where	/! 
is the frequency vector and .! corresponds to the amplitude vector, 2 = 1, 2, … , 3.  

Feature extracting is the process of extracting non-redundant, abstract or meaningful 
information  out  of  the  data  which  better  represents  an  underlying  problem  to  the 
predictive models. Difference between sound signals collected over defective and non-
defective concrete are not obvious in time-domain (see Figure 3 a, b and c). On the other 
hand, FFT signal shows a distinguishable pattern in energy (see Figure 3 d, e and f) i.e., 
magnitude  of  energy  is  lower  over  defects  because  they  absorb  impact  energy.  Our 
feature extraction method is inspired by [21], where we use FFT while they use Wavelet 
Transform  [22].  Feature  calculations  is  defined  with  the  following  expressions  (see 
Equations 2 to 7 and Table I). These types of features capture different properties of the 
sound data. From mathematics we know that moments are quantitative measures related 
to the shape of the function. For these reasons we use spectral moments as features.

In  this  work  we  use  unsupervised  classification  to  classify  non-defective  and 
defective  concrete.  We  use  K-means  [10],  which  is  one  of  the  most  famous 
unsupervised clustering methods. Given the matrix of features 4 (see Equation 9), this

Additionally, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [25] for defect analysis 
and dimension reduction of feature matrix ;. PCA takes as input the matrix of data and 
calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors, it only uses significant eigenvectors to recreate 
the data. We use this method in two ways. First, we use the filtering properties of this 
method  for  data  processing  that  goes  as  input  into  K-means  clustering.  Second,  we 
visualize some of the principal components and use image enhancement techniques [27] 
to improve the results. 

EXPERIMENTS 

We  collected  data  in  our  concrete  slab  over  the  area  that  contains  two  types  of 
defects, void and delamination. We collected 902 data points (.wav) with a 2cm spacing 
in x and y directions, over an area 20cm wide and 162cm long. Sounds are recorded 
using a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and a 16-bit AD. Each data point has an ID, which is 
tagged with the location information with respect to the starting point. 

Feature Visualization 

Features  contain  meaningful  information;  it  helps  to  visualize  the  defects.  From 
visualization (see Figure 5) we can clearly see the void box, while delamination circle

(Equation  12),  leading  to  much  clearer  visualization  results.  For  example,  first  and 
second  moments  are  enhanced  by  squaring  them,  and  power  feature  is  enhanced  by 
increasing it to the third power.

PCA Maps 

We  use  PCA  decomposition  for  the  feature  matrix  ;  (see  Equation  9).  For  one 
component (C1) the amount of preserved information is 76.8%, for two components 
(C1+C2) 96.7% and for three (C1+C2+C3) 98.8%. For visualization we decided to use 
three components. We visualize all individual components and their linear combination 
(see Figure 6). They act as three combined predictors with equal weights. From results 
we can see that using PCA we are able to generate meaningful maps. Void is clearly 
visible, especially in the enhanced maps. Delamination is weakly detected.  

Unsupervised Clustering Maps 

Up  to  this  point,  we  generated  few  types  of  data  that  can  go  into  K-means  and 
Spectral Clustering. First type is the feature matrix 4 (see Equation 8). Second type is 
enhanced feature matrix, where feature vectors are defined as 5*+,0 (see Equation 12). 
Third type is PCA. We use Silhouette coefficient to determine how good the clusters 
are separated, closer to 1 is better, -1 is worse. Table II shows the values for all cases 
when  using  two  (defect/no  defect)  three  clusters  (void/delamination/no  defect). 
According to the Table II, best clustering is achieved by Spectral Clustering using two 
clusters.

When we use ; and >@A(;, 3) as input for the K-means, the output is noisy and 
not very clear (see Figure 7a1, 7a2, 7b1 and 7b2). Feature enhancement improves the 
results (see Figure 7a1 and 7a3). Spectral Clustering uses the unmodified features ; and 
outputs very similar results with feature enhancement (see Figure 7a3 and 7a4). On the 
other hand, having three clusters differentiates the void and delamination (see Figure 
7b).  This  figure  shows  parts  of  concrete  close  by  artificial  defects  as  weakened  or 
deteriorated. Finally, 3D scatter plots are generated by using PCA decomposition with 
cluster information (see Figure 7c). 

CONCLUSION 

This  paper  introduces  a  robotic  solution  for  data  collection  and  an  unsupervised 
learning method for impact-sounding data analysis. The robotic platform is equipped 
with visual, inertial and encoder fusion for high accuracy localization. It makes data 
collection much faster and improves data consistency. Data analysis algorithm starts 
with transforming the sound data into the spectral domain, then we calculate features. 
We  use  PCA  to  generate  maps,  then  use  K-means  and  Spectral  Clustering  for 
classification. Results from PCA maps and clustered maps can be used together to reveal 
defects. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.
