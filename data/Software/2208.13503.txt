Abstract. Jet ﬂavor tagging is crucial for Rb(Rc) measurement, which is sensitive to testing the Standard
Model and searching for new physic models. In this study, a Deep Learning method, ParticleNet, is used
to enhance the eﬃciency of jet ﬂavor tagging. The product of eﬃciency and purity of c-tagging is improved
by more than 50% compared to the CEPC baseline software whose eﬃciency is 60%. Two methods are
employed to measure Rb(Rc), referred as double tagging and inverse matrix, based on the new ﬂavor
tagging approach. Both of them can improve the precision of Rb(Rc), particularly for Rc, which has a 60%
reduction in statistical uncertainty. In addition, the systematic uncertainties of the Monte Carlo simulation
and the Deep Learning model are investigated.

1 Introduction

The measurement of the relative partial decay widths of
Z boson, Rq = Γq ¯q/Γh, plays a crucial role in testing the
Standard Model(SM) [1,2] and searching for new physics.
Particularly, Rb is sensitive to the correction of Zb¯b ver-
tex with new physics [3]. The decay width to a quark-
antiquark ﬁnal state can be expressed as [4]

smaller than the experimental ones by about two orders
of magnitudes. So the experimental precision of Rb(Rc)
needs to be improved to compare with the predictions, to
clarify the potential discrepancy, and to probe the physics
beyond the SM.

Various approaches have been used to measure the
Rb(Rc), such as single tagging, double tagging, multi-tagging,
etc. However, the precision was limited by the statistics
and detector performance. Recently, a few electron-positron
colliders, the CEPC [12], FCC-ee [13], etc, were proposed
to perform precision Higgs and electroweak studies. These
facilities are going to deliver huge statistics of data at Z
pole, W pair threshold, and about 240 GeV to maximize
the production cross section of Higgs-struhlung process,
and so on. It is natural that these experiments will adopt
both new detector and software technologies to achieve
the best performance in the detection and reconstruction
of physics objects, especially for jets.

Libo Liao et al.: Performance studies of jet ﬂavor tagging and measurement of Rb using ParticleNet at CEPC

To measure Rb(Rc), jets are essential physics objects.
Therefore, good jet-clustering and tagging algorithms are
key ingredients, in particular, the jet ﬂavor tagging. Jets
from diﬀerent quarks or gluon have various useful char-
acteristics. For instance, gluon jets usually have a wider
energy distribution than those of quark jets, and the ver-
tex displacements of tracks of a b jet are larger than those
of other types of jet because of the longer lifetimes of bot-
tom mesons, and several other characteristics derived from
quarks or gluon are also diﬀerent. These features are the
basis of algorithms to tag jets.

A large number of jet tagging algorithms have been
developed recently based on various approaches. For ex-
ample, the LCFIPlus [14] based on BDT, is used for the
International Linear Collider(ILC) [15,16], the CEPC, and
the FCC-ee physics performance study and detector op-
timization. The CEPC delivers great b/c-tagging perfor-
mance thanks to its high precision vertex detector. The
b-jets can be tagged with an eﬃciency of 80% at a purity
of 90%. Compared with b-tagging, c-jet tagging is particu-
larly challenging as charm hadrons have relatively shorter
lifetimes than bottom ones and suﬀer more backgrounds.
Therefore, an eﬃciency of 60% and a purity of 60% can
be achieved for the c-jet tagging.

In this article, the performance of ﬂavor tagging of
the CEPC baseline detector is improved using a new deep
learning (DL) model, ParticleNet [17]. The same method
is also used for the event classiﬁcation and measuring
Rb(Rc). In addition, another novel DL model, Particle
Flow Network(PFN)[18], is used for comparison and cross
check. The rest parts are organized as the following. The
simulation, reconstruction software, and Monte Carlo (MC)
samples are introduced in Section 2; the DL model and the
results of ﬂavor tagging are presented in Section 3; then
the measurement of Rb(Rc) with new methods is discussed
in Section 4; and a summary is given in Section 5.

2 Detector, software, and samples

The study is based on the CEPC baseline detector, which,
as shown in Fig. 1, is advanced from the International
Large Detector (ILD) [19] on the ILC and optimized to
meet the physics requirement of the CEPC. The baseline
detector is designed according to the Particle Flow Algo-
rithm [20], which could reap a better precision and eﬃ-
ciency of reconstructed objects by using the most suitable
sub-detectors. From the inside out, the detector includes
a silicon pixel vertex detector, a silicon tracker, a time
projection chamber (TPC), a calorimetry system which
includes an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a
hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) of very high granularity, and
a muon detector embedded inside the return yoke of a
solenoid magnet system which provides a magnetic ﬁeld
of 3 Tesla.

The vertex detector consists of six layers of silicon
pixel sensors with excessive spatial resolution. The silicon
tracker is made of 4 components, which are the Silicon
Inner Tracker (SIT), the Silicon External Tracker (SET),
the Forward Tracking Detector (FTD), and the End-cap

is composed of a silicon pixel vertex detector, a silicon inner
tracker, a TPC, a silicon external tracker, an ECAL, an HCAL,
a solenoid of 3 Tesla, and a muon detector. The right is the
silicon pixel vertex detector, which consists with 3 concentric
cylindrical double-layers of high spatial resolution.

Tracking Detector (ETD). The TPC is designed within the
framework of the LCTPC collaboration [21]. The ECAL
and HCAL are each composed of 1 barrel and 2 end-cap
sections. The detailed description of the CEPC baseline
detector may be seen in Ref. [12].

The MC samples for this study are produced with
the CEPC full simulation, reconstruction, and analysis
framework [22]. The physics processes are generated with
WHIZARD 1.9.5 [23]. PYTHIA 6 [24] is then used for
hadronization. MokkaPlus [25], a GEANT4-based [26] de-
tector simulation tool, is used to model the detector re-
sponse. Arbor [20] is used to reconstruct physics objects
including tracks, photons, and neutral hadrons, and LCFI-
Plus [14] is used to reconstruct (secondary) vertices and
jets.

In this study, there are 3 hadronic decay modes of Z
boson used for jet ﬂavor tagging study, which are e+e− →
Z → b¯b, c¯c, and o¯o(u¯u/d ¯d/s¯s). In the measurement of
Rb(Rc), the main background process, Z → τ τ , is also
taken into account. For each process, 450,000 events are
produced, which has 900,000 jets in total. The jets are
reconstructed using e+e−-kt algorithm in LCFIPlus [14],
where all particles, including the reconstructed primary
and second vertices, are clustered into two jets.

3 Jet ﬂavor tagging with ParticleNet

In this study, ParticleNet is used as the nominal model
and PFN as a comparison and cross check.

Based on the particle cloud representation, which treats
a jet as an unordered group of particles, an eﬀective model,
ParticleNet, has been developed. It is a customized neu-
ral network model using Dynamic Graph Convolutional
Neural Network (DGCNN) [27] for jet tagging.

ParticleNet has several advantages. First, it can deal
with the varying number of particles in an event, which
is common in experimental high energy physics. Second,

the model is designed to respect the particle permutation
invariance, which makes a natural and promising repre-
sentation of jets. Third, ParticleNet makes extensive use
of EdgeConv [27] operations to update the graph represen-
tation dynamically for better performance. Last but not
least, ParticleNet could exploit local neighborhood infor-
mation explicitly while most of the other DL models could
only use global symmetric features.

3.1 Deep learning models and conﬁguration

ParticleNet model used in this paper consists of three
EdgeConv blocks, a global average pooling layer and two
fully connected layers. The number of channels C for each
EdgeConv block is (64, 64,64), (128, 128, 128), and (256,
256, 256), respectively. After the EdgeConv blocks, a channel-
wise [28] global average pooling operation is applied to ag-
gregate the learned features over all particles in the cloud.
This is followed by a fully connected layer with 256 units
and the ReLU activation [29]. A dropout layer [30] with a
drop probability of 0.1 is included to prevent overﬁtting. A
fully connected layer with N units, followed by a softmax
function, is used to generate the output, where the N is
the number of categories in the classiﬁcation task. For the
number of nearest neighbors k for all three blocks, some
optimization is performed, which indicates that 12 for jet
tagging and 16 for event classiﬁcation are optimal. The
conﬁguration of PFN is directly taken from the Ref. [18],
since it is only used for cross check.

3.2 Visualizing the data sets

Jet ﬂavor tagging algorithm is based on features of the
data sets. In this study, these features could be catego-
rized into three types. The ﬁrst is the jet kinematics, such
as the intermediate hadrons, multiplicity, and momentum
distribution, etc. The second is impact parameters of the
charged tracks, which are very informative for b-tagging.
The last one is types of particles in a jet, i.e. particle iden-
tiﬁcation (PID). Considering three types of jets to be stud-
ied, some distributions are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) is
the multiplicity versus momenta of tracks, where it can be
seen that the number of tracks of b jets is slightly larger
than those of c jets and light (o) jets, which is consistent
with the decay properties of heavier B hadrons. The dis-
tribution of impact parameters versus momenta is shown
in Fig. 2(b). Clear patterns can be observed: b jets have
signiﬁcant contribution of larger impact parameters and
of energetic tracks compared with c and o jets. Figure 2(c)
shows the weighted fractions of diﬀerent particle types
in the three physics processes. It is clear that b quarks
produce more energetic leptons, c quarks produce slightly
more energetic kaons.

In the event classiﬁcation, the main background pro-
cess is e+e− → Z → τ +τ −. This background has rather
diﬀerent features, obviously, compared with the signal, i.e
e+e− → b¯b, c¯c and o¯o, as shown in Fig. 3. It indicates
that the background has signiﬁcantly less multiplicity and
higher momenta of tracks.

3.3 Training and evaluation

Both ParticleNet and PFN are implemented and running
with 8 Intel(cid:114) Xeon(cid:114) Gold 6240 CPU cores and 4 NVIDIA(cid:114)
Tesla(cid:114) V100-SXM2-32GB GPU cards at the IHEP GPU
farm. During model training, the common properties of
the neural networks include a categorical cross-entropy
loss function, the Adam optimization algorithm [31], a
batch size of 1,024, a starting learning rate of 0.005. 900,000
jets are used for each production mode, and the total num-
ber of jets of 3 decays is 2,700,000. The full data-set is split
into training, validation, and test samples according to the
fraction of 7:1.5:1.5. The monitoring of loss and accuracy
on training and validation shows that the models converge
well and there is no obvious over-training after 30 epochs.
The computation consumption of ParticleNet and PFN
models could be estimated. Only total consumption of
GPU and CPU is used for estimation, since all the comput-
ing resources could only be accessed indirectly via a work-
load manager server. ParticleNet takes about 190 minutes
for training (30 epochs) and 3 minutes for inference. PFN
takes about 30 minutes for training (80 epochs) and less a
minute for inference. Both two methods could be ﬁnished
on a reasonable time scale.

3.4 Performance

Both ParticleNet and PFN outperform than the LCFIPlus
in terms of jet ﬂavor tagging. The accuracy of two novel
models are summarized in Table 2, together with those
in Ref. [32]. PartcileNet could achieve accuracy of about
87.6%, which is at least 9% better than those in Ref. [32].
Figure 4(a) shows the confusion matrix with Parti-
cleNet and Fig. 4(b) is the Receiver Operating Charac-
teristic (ROC) curves, another metric to demonstrate the
performance of a classiﬁer. The numerical results of eﬃ-
ciencies and Area Under Curve (AUC) of both models in
diﬀerent jet tagging are listed in Table 3. The eﬃciencies,
also called recalls, are determined by taking the largest
score of a jet predicted by the classiﬁers, which are same
as the corresponding diagonal terms of the confusion ma-
trix. It can be seen that the performance of b-tagging is
always better than c- and o-tagging. This observation is
consistent with the results in Ref. [32].

The performance of ParticleNet and PFN are gener-
ally better than those in Ref. [32]. This could be explained
from two sides, one is that much richer information of a jet
is used including four momenta, impact parameters, and
PIDs, the other is that ParticleNet and PFN have strong
inductive bias for representing high energy events. Par-
ticleNet outperforms PFN, which is consistent with the
study in Ref. [17], and the authors explained that "the
Deep Sets(PFN) approach does not explicitly exploit the
local spatial structure of particle clouds, but only pro-
cesses the particle clouds in a global way."

To demonstrate the physics impacts of ﬂavor tagging,
a detailed comparison in terms of the product of eﬃciency
and purity, (cid:15)ρ, is performed. Taking the measurement of

To compare the performance of various ﬂavor tagging
methods, some working points are chosen. The Table 4
summarizes the numerical results, where LCFIPlus and

XGBoost are taken as references. The table shows that in
terms of the product of eﬃciency and purity, the perfor-
mance of ParticleNet is much better than the others, es-
pecially in c-tagging. ParticleNet is more than 50% better
compared with LCFIPlus when the eﬃciency of c-taggging
is 60%. A speciﬁc example to illustrate the impact is that
ParticleNet could improve the statistical uncertainty in
counting c jets by 30% compared with the XGBoost. PFN

where i(j) = b, c, o are ﬂavors of jets, Cij is the correlation
between a jet pair of ﬂavor j when both are tagged as i, εij
is the eﬃciency of a j jet being tagged as a i jet, N h,pro is
total number of Z hadronic events produced in collisions,
Ri is the relative decay widths of Z to jet pair of i.

Rc measurement is more challenging than Rb, since
the c-tagging has less eﬃciency and less purity than b-
tagging. Therefore, several methods are employed, such
as double tag measurement, charm counting, etc. In fact,
the key ingredient of a relative partial width measurement
is classifying the signal and background correctly. Here a
novel analysis method is proposed in terms of event clas-
siﬁcation, as a natural result of advancements in DL. This
method would treat each event as a whole, which means
that much richer information could be used simultane-
ously and that jet clustering is not necessary.

The same data sets are used for event classiﬁcation,
and the main SM background process Z → τ τ is taken
into account in this case. For each process, 450,000 events
are used, and the total number of events is 1,800,000.

The results of event classiﬁcation with ParticleNet are
shown in Fig. 5 and Table 5 ( results of PFN are also listed
for comparison). It can be seen that the eﬃciency of event
classiﬁcation is higher than that of jet tagging, which is
intelligible that more information is applied in events than
those in jets.

To measure Rb(Rc), two methods can be applied. The
ﬁrst is solving the Equations (4) to get Rb(Rc) (Ro =
1 − Rb − Rc by deﬁnition) when a working point is de-
termined. All the εij could be determined by MC simula-
tion and the correlation between jets could be neglected
temporarily. Signal regions of b, c, and o candidates are
deﬁned as the red lines, i.e, working point, in Fig. 6. There
are 2 equations for each region, and 6 in total. As over-
determined equations, they could be solved by the least
square method. Using the same integrated luminosity as-

sumed in Ref. [33], a toy MC approach is used to calculate
statistical uncertainty of Rb(Rc). A total number of 1011
Z hadronic decay events is sampled according to Poisson
distribution, and then this number is sampled into three
categories, b¯b, c¯c, and o¯o, according to multinomial dis-
tribution. The detection and selection procedures are also
simulated according to multinomial distribution. Finally,
three observed numbers are obtained by adding sampling
results. Now Rb(Rc) could be calculated with the least
square method, as well as its statistical uncertainty.

An alternative method, named inverse matrix, is solv-
ing the equations of the confusion matrix ((cid:15)ij) and ob-
served numbers of signal candidates (ni) to determined
Rb(Rc), as shown in Equation (5).

where Ni is the number of produced events of each chan-
nel. Therefore, Rq = Ni/(cid:80) Ni could be measured simul-
taneously. Using the same toy MC simulation, similar pre-
cision is achieved.

The results of the two methods are summarized in
in Table 6. The measurements of the LEP/SLD [10] and
Ref. [33] also listed for comparison. The uncertainties of
relative decay width in LEP/SLD [10] are mainly limited
by the statistics. The template ﬁt [33] got excellent pre-
cision, which has the advantages of much larger statistics
and more information used. The double tag and inverse
matrix methods also achieve comparable precision as the
template ﬁt on Rb, but the precision of Rc is improved by
almost 60%, since the DL model has much better c-tagging
eﬃciency compared with that of the LCFIPlus.

discovered and uncertainties of the existing decay modes
have been improved a lot. When these updates are imple-
mented in the generators in the future, the associated sys-
tematic uncertainties could be reduced by orders of mag-
nitude.

The correlation between jets could be reduced when
tagging eﬃciencies have been improved. In addition, in
the second method of Rb(Rc) measurement, an event is
taken as a global object without jet-clustering. Therefore,
the systematic uncertainty due to the correlation disap-
pears. In the studies of the LEP/SLD experiments [5,6,
7,8,9], this systematic uncertainty is an important item
and estimated from 2.7 × 10−4 to 6.7 × 10−3, depending
on the methods used. As a conclusion, two methods used
in this study could reduce this systematic uncertainty or
avoid it.

For the systematic uncertainties, they are usually arose
by the input kinematic variables and the hyper-parameters.
The eﬀects of the input kinematic variables can be eval-
uated by changing detector coverage and resolutions, be-
cause the DL model takes the particle level information
as input directly. To enlarge the statistics, fast simulation
is used to generated 4 times larger samples than full sim-
ulation. The nominal samples are simulated according to
the performance of the CEPC baseline detector in CDR.
Alternative samples are generated by varying the momen-
tum resolution by 10%, resolutions of impact parameters
by 1%, and detector coverage by 0.1% to estimated the
systematic uncertainties of detection eﬀect. The results
are summarized in Table 7. Beneﬁted from the excellent
resolutions and eﬃciency of the baseline detector, the im-
pacts of changing of momenta resolution and detector cov-
erage are under control. But for the impact parameters,
the systematic uncertainty of Rc is larger than it of Rb.
The reason could be that the charm mesons have rela-
tively shorter life-times and smaller vertex displacement,
which makes c-tagging strongly depend on the precision

ﬁcations. The upper left triangle is candidate area of b, the

Systematic uncertainties Relative decay width is speci-
ﬁed as a ratio, as mentioned in the introduction, and many
systematic uncertainties may vanish. The systematic un-
certainties are still dominant at CEPC and FCC-ee, how-
ever, since the statistical uncertainties would be improved
by orders of magnitudes with huge statistics. The residual
systematic uncertainties arise mainly through the quanti-
ties calculated using MC simulation, such as eﬃciencies,
the correlations between the quarks in an event, and the
DL model, etc.

Compared with the LEP era, the systematic uncer-
tainties of eﬃciencies arisen by MC models, such as the
lifetimes of long-lived hadrons, the branching ratios, and
so on, will be improved signiﬁcantly. Those quantities are
intensively studied, so many new decay modes have been

of impact parameters. Hence, the speciﬁc commission and
alignment of the vertex detector are very challenging and
crucial for controlling this systematic uncertainty in fu-
ture, because that the precision of CEPC vertex detector
could reach micron-level. It should be noticed that the un-
certainty of PID is not discussed in this research, because
this is a new feature in the design stage and the detailed
performance is not ﬁnalized yet.

The systematic uncertainties caused by DL model are
also estimated by changing its hyper-parameters. The num-
ber of EdgeConv blocks is changed by 1, the number of
neighbors required by k-NN is changed by 2, and the num-
ber of units of a fully connected layer is changed by 30, the
summarized results are also shown in Table 7. The model
uncertainties are at the same order for Rb and Rc, while
those of Rc are slightly larger than Rb.

In conclusion, the systematic uncertainties of detector
resolutions and coverage are estimated to be at 10−5 level,
and ones of the DL model at 10−4 level, which are much
larger than the statistical uncertainties. In future stud-
ies, the total systematic uncertainty of Rb(Rc) could be
improved by several ways. The MC simulation can be im-
proved by implementing the recent measurements of long-
lived particle lifetimes, branching ratios, and masses, etc.
The systematic uncertainty of impact parameters could
be reduced using data-driven method to tune MC simu-
lation. The correlation between two jets certainly could
be improved by theoretical calculation. But it is worth to
note that this systematic uncertainty could be avoided in
the inverse matrix method.

5 Summary and discussion

In this study, DL methods are used to enhance the perfor-
mance of jet ﬂavor tagging. Graph neural networks could
achieve signiﬁcant improvement on jet ﬂavor tagging, es-
pecially on c-tagging. In terms of product of purity and
eﬃciency, the c-tagging is improved more than 50% com-
pared to the CEPC baseline software, LCFIPlus, when ef-
ﬁciency of c-tagging is 60%. It’s understandable that Par-
ticleNet achieves signiﬁcantly better performance. Com-
pared to the traditional methods, ParticleNet could maxi-
mize the usage of information in a jet or an event, because
all the information is used as input, such as momenta,
energies, and impact parameters. On the other hand, the
point-cloud (set) representation, which preserves some im-
portant symmetries, has better expressive power for high
energy events [34].

To demonstrate the physics impacts of these two tag-
ging methods, Rb(Rc) is taken as a test bed. Firstly, the
double tagging method shows that the precision of Rc
can be improved by a factor of 1.6, compared with that
in Ref. [33]. Second, a new method is proposed, named
inverse matrix, which can achieve comparable statistical
precision as those of the ﬁrst one and avoid the important
systematic uncertainty caused by the correlation between
two jets.

According to the study in Ref. [35], precision Rb mea-
surement could be extremely sensitive to the modiﬁcations
on the gLb and gRb couplings by new physics, because of
the strong correlation between δgLb and δgRb. For more
details, see the Ref. [35].

The main systematic uncertainties of Rb(Rc) measure-
ment with high statistics are investigated, in particular
on detector resolutions and the DL model. As a prelimi-
nary conclusion, the systematic uncertainties are generally
one or two orders of magnitudes larger than this of sta-
tistical uncertainty. Dealing with systematic uncertainty
of the analysis with huge statistics will be rather chal-
lenging in future. Fortunately, huge statistics also make
data-driven feasible to calibrate the MC simulation pre-
cisely. And studies on systematic uncertainty associated
with DL methods are hot spot and advancing very fast.
Hence, it is promising that all the systematic uncertain-
ties could be reduced in future with more data added and
development of new approaches.
