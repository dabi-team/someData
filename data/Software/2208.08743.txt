Abstract  
Context: Software industry is continuously exploring better ways to develop applications. A new 
phenomenon to achieve this is Cloud based Global Software Development (CGSD), which refers 
to  the  adoption  of  cloud  computing  services  by  organizations  to  support  global  software 
development projects. The CGSD approach affects the strategic and operational aspects of the way 
projects are managed. Objective: The objective of the study is to identify the success factors which 
contribute to  management  of  CGSD projects.  Methods:  We carried out  a  Multivocal  Literature 
Review (MLR) to identify the success factors from the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice 
in project management of CGSD projects. We identified 32 success factors that contribute to the 
management  of  CGSD  projects.  Results:  The  findings  of  MLR  indicate  that  time  to  market, 
continuous development, financial restructuring, scalability Moreover, the findings of the study 
show  that  there  is  a  positive  correlation  between  the  success  factors  reported  in  both  formal 
literature and industry based grey literature.   Conclusion: The findings of this study can assist the 
practitioners to develop the strategies needed for effective project management of CGSD projects. 

Keywords: Cloud based global software development, success factors, multivocal review, project 
management.  

1. Introduction  
A  number  of  software  development  methods  have  been  proposed  to  help  organizations  in 
application development ranging from traditional waterfall to agile methods[1]. The emergence of 
cloud sourcing facilitates organizations to have on-demand access to a shared and scalable range 
of IT resources such as storage and applications [2, 3]. In this paper, we adopt Schhneider and 
Sunyaey’s definition of cloud scouring [3]: “an organizations’ decision to adopt and integrate 
cloud services from external providers into their IT landscape, that is, the customer organization’s 
assessment of cloud computing offering from one or more providers in form of service model (IaaS, 
PaaS,  SaaS)  or  deployment,  model  (e.g.  public,  private,  community,  hybrid)”.  Cloud  sourcing 
changes how organizations manage their computing infrastructure by allowing them to transfer 
applications, services and data to cloud servers.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  success  of  cloud  sourcing  also  captured  the  attention  of  the  number  of  global  software 
development organizations that strive to take advantage of scalability, on-demand services, and a 
large  amount  of  virtual  storage  during  the  transformation  of  development  activities  to  the 
distributed sites across the globe [4, 5]. This type of organizations leveraging cloud computing 
services  to  support  the  outsource  development  process  is  referred  to  as  Cloud  based  Global 
Software Development (CGSD) [4]. With CGSD, organizations use on-demand access to a pool 
of scalable IT resources; and potentially increase product quality by having access to relatively 
low  cost  skilled  human  resources  [6].  Moreover,  CGSD  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the 
development  time  using  follow-the-sun  concepts  [7]  supported  by  different  cloud  service  and 
deployment models.  

Managing CGSD projects are challenging due to concerns related to security and privacy of data, 
24/7 development model, and coordination complexities because of language, terminology, and 
cultural  differences  between  geographically  distributed  teams  [8-10].  CGSD  also  requires 
organizations to adjust their management processes [3] due to different service and deployment 
models.  However, little empirical insight is available about the management decisions through 
which  CGSD  can  be  successful.  A  better  understanding  of  the  success  factors  associated  with 
CGSD project management can be helpful to practitioners for carrying out project management 
activities in CGSD context.   

The objective of this study is to identify the factors which impact successful management of CGSD 
projects. We also analyze the identified success factors from both client and vendor perspective. 
Moreover, the success factors are mapped into knowledge areas of the PMBOK. We believe that 
the  identified  success  factors  will  assist  the  practitioners  in  developing  the  strategies  for  the 
successful managing the global software development activities using the cloud environment. We 
used the multivocal literature review (MLR) approach to collect evidence from both the state-of-
the-art and practice in the management of CGSD projects. This study provides both scholars and 
practitioners  with  a  knowledge  base  to  identifying  the  success  factors  that  contribute  to  the 
successful  management  of  CGSD  projects.  In  this  paper,  we  address  the  following  research 
questions:   

RQ1: What are the success factors for managing CGSD projects as identified in the multivocal 
literature review?  
RQ2:  Are  there  any  differences  between  the  success  factors  identified  in  the  formal  and  grey 
literature?  
RQ3: What success factors are related to CGSD vendor or client organizations?  
RQ4: What success factors are related to 10 knowledge areas of PMBOK?  

In  RQ1,  we  aim  to  identify  the  success  factors  that  positively  impact  the  cloud  based  global 
software development activities as reported by state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practices. In RQ2, 
we aim to study any potential differences or similarities between the success factors reported in 
both types of literature. In RQ3, we investigate the identified success factors from both client and 
vendor organizational perspective. Lastly, in RQ4, we map the identified CGSD success factors 
against 10 knowledge areas of PMBOK.  

 
 
 
 
 
The  remaining  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  related  work  and  motivation  of  the  study  are 
presented in Section 2. Section 3 presented the research methodology. The results are discussed in 
Section 4. Section 5 presents the results summary, implications and future work and limitations of 
the study. Finally, the conclusion and future research directions are presented in Section 6.  

2 Related Work and Study Motivation  
Cloud  service  providers  offer  software  services  as  “infrastructure  as  service,”  “platform  as 
service,” and “software  as service”  [11].  Moreover, cloud  sourcing  supports  utility  computing 
with different deployment options such as “private,” “public,” “hybrid,” and “community” models 
[11-14]. Global software development is facing challenges with respect to business uncertainty, 
computing capacity, storage and security concerns [12-14]. Cloud sourcing is a promising solution 
to these challenges as it provides access to a shared pool of IT resources, applications, and services 
on a pay-per-use basis [15-17].  

Several researchers reported how cloud sourcing can address some of the key challenges face by 
the global software industry. For example, Rousan [12] conducted a study to explore the critical 
challenges faced in cloud based GSD and presented a risk management model, which assists in 
analyzing and assessing the impact of risks. The model aims to analyze and prioritize cloud risks 
based  on  their  impact  on  the  GSD  process.  Similarly,  Cocco  et  al.  [13]  presented  a  model  for 
analyzing how GSD can be facilitated using a cloud environment. They developed a tool for small 
and  medium  software  development  organizations  to  determine  the  development  time  and  cost 
while adopting cloud-based GSD paradigm. The tool provides a comparison between traditional 
and cloud-based GSD projects in terms of development time and cost. The study indicates that the 
cloud-based GSD is cost-effective and time-effective with respect to the traditional development 
paradigm.  Furthermore,  project  managers  can  also  use  the  tool  to  manage  cloud-based  GSD 
projects.  

In another study, Yara et al. [14] highlighted that the cloud based GSD paradigm is significant for 
both client and vendor organizations as it helps organizations to overcome challenges with respect 
to  computing  capacity,  storage  and  business  uncertainty.  They  presented  a  generic  cloud 
architecture  to  support  GSD  projects.  Furthermore,  they  also  highlighted  that  vendor  lock-in, 
privacy,  data  access  and  regulatory  compliance  are  key  challenges  faced  by  cloud-based  GSD 
projects. Moreover, Haig-Smith and Tanner [18] used the domestication theory to understand how 
cloud  sourcing  was  used  in  agile  global  software  development.  The  study  indicates  that  cloud 
sourcing  can  help  reduce  feedback  latency  in  agile  global  software  development  projects. 
Moreover,  they  also  found  that  cloud  sourcing  helps  software  developers  in  an  agile  global 
software project to focus on project delivery.  

Oza et al. [19] conducted a qualitative study to identify the benefits and risks associated with cloud 
based distributed software development paradigm. The study mentioned that the cloud platform 
plays a significant role in managing the software development activities conducted in a distributed 
environment. Besides, they also reported that cloud platforms can be used to address the inherent 
challenges associated with  global software development, such as temporal  differences  and task 
synchronization. Alajrami et al. [20]  presented a software development as a service architecture 
to facilitate GSD projects in the cloud. Moreover, Alajrami et al. [21] integrated global distance 

 
 
 
 
metric  into  software  development  as  a  service  architecture  to  provide  task  allocation  decision 
support for GSD projects.   

One key issue faced by global software development is that organizations try to incorporate cloud 
sourcing in their projects prior to understanding their management readiness. To date, no study has 
been conducted that presents evidence from both formal literature and grey literature to identify 
the success factors of managing CGSD projects. We believe there is a need for a study for both 
researchers  and  practitioners  to  understand  success  factors  for  managing  CGSD  projects  from 
literature  and  industry  point  of  view.  This  study  presents  the  success  factors  which  can  assist 
organizations to manage CGSD projects.  

3. Research methodologies  
This study aims to identify the factors that contribute to project management success in  CGSD 
projects.  We  used  the  Multivocal  Literature  Review  (MLR)  [22]  methods,  which  is  a  type  of 
systematic literature review that provide insight with respect to both the state-of-the-art and state-
of-the-practice  to  answer  the  research  questions  [22-24].  As  part  of  MLR,  we  reviewed  the 
literature  published  in  both  formal  (e.g.,  peer-reviewed  journals,  conferences  etc.)  and  grey 
(industry standards, white papers, videos, blogs etc.) literature.  Figure 1 presents an overview of 
our research methodology.  

Figure 1: Proposed research methodology 

3.1 Planning the review  
As outlined in guidelines for MLR[22], a formal MLR protocol was developed before conducting 
the review process. All members of the research team participated in the MLR phases. Using the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
MLR  approach,  data  is  collected  from  two  sources  i.e.,  formal  published  literature  and  grey 
literature. Both the data extraction processes are discussed in the following sections. 

3.2 Data collection  
3.2.1 Formal data collection  
To collect the peer-reviewed published primary studies, we followed the following steps:  

Search string 
We  applied  the  guidelines  provided  by  Zhang  and  Babar  [25]  to  develop  the  search  strings  by 
concatenating the keyword and their alternatives. The keywords were selected by following the 
Quasi-Gold Standard (QGS) guidelines [26]. As part of the QGS guidelines, seven primary studies 
[FS1-FS7] (given in appendix-A) were selected to extract potential keywords to develop the search 
string. The keywords and their synonyms were concatenated using the Boolean “OR” and “AND” 
operators to structure the final search string as follows:  

“(success factors OR factors OR aspects OR items OR elements OR drivers OR motivators OR 
variables)  AND  (Outsourcing  OR  global  software  development  OR  geographically  distributed 
development  OR  offshore  development  OR  multisite  development  OR  collaborative  software 
development) AND (IaaS OR PaaS OR SaaS OR XaaS OR infrastructure as a Service OR platform 
as a  service OR  Software as  a Service  OR  IT service OR Application Service OR  ASP) AND 
(cloud sourcing OR cloud computing OR cloud platform OR cloud provider OR cloud service OR 
cloud offering) AND (client software development organizations OR client software development 
companies  OR    client  analysis  OR  client  perspective)  AND  (vendor  software  development 
organizations  OR  vendor  software  development  companies  OR  vendor  analysis  OR  vendor 
perspective) AND (client-vendor analysis OR client-vendor perspective)”. 

The following well known digital repositories are selected to execute the search strings and explore 
the results:  

•  “IEEE Xplore” 
•  “ACM Digital Library” 
•  “Springer Link” 
•  “Wiley Inter-Science” 
•  “Science Direct” 
•  “Google Scholar” 
•  “IET digital library” 

Furthermore, “we also used forward and backward snowballing approaches to search the required 
data [27, 28]. The forward snowballing refers to the studies that cited the paper and the backward 
refer to the studies that are cited in the paper (reference list of the paper) [29, 30].”The snowballing 
is an effective way to collect the most potential literature related to the context of the study[29, 
30].  

Inclusion criteria 
We developed the inclusion criteria based on the guidelines given in [9, 31, 32]. The key points of 
inclusion criteria include: “(i) study must be a conference paper, book chapter or journal article. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) study should be about CGSD, (iii) study should contain the factors that could positively impact 
the  management  of  CGSD  projects,  and  (iv)  results  of  the  study  should  base  on  empirical 
evaluation”.  

Exclusion criteria  
We applied the exclusion criteria developed to exclude the irrelevant studies based on the guideline 
given in [30, 32, 33]. The key points of exclusion criteria are: “(i) studies that were not relevant to 
the research objectives of this study (ii) studies that have not provided any details of the success 
factors that are significant for CGSD program (iii) studies were also excluded that were not written 
in English and (iv) the duplicate studies were also not considered”.   

Study Quality Evaluation Criteria 
The quality of the selected studies are assessed using the criteria adopted from different other SLR 
studies  in  software  engineering  domains  [9,  31,  34,  35].  The  assessment  criteria  consist  of  the 
checklist  that  contains  five  quality  assessment  questions  (Table  1).    Each  selected  study  was 
assessed against the questions of the assessment criteria using the given Likert scale (Table 1).  
The final score of each study is given in Appendix-A.

Selection of formal primary studies 
Three different steps are followed to select the most relevant studies. The study selection steps are 
based  on  the  suggestions  provided  by  [30].  Initially,  seven  studies  are  manually  selected  by 
considering the suggestions of QGS [26]. The manually selected studies are directly related to the 
subject of the study. Moreover, we used the search strings discussed in section-3.2.1 and extracted 
2273  studies  from  seven  digital  repositories  using  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria. 
Furthermore, the tollgate approach [30] is used and in total, 132 primary studies are selected for 
the study, as shown in Figure 2. Every selected primary study (Appendix-A) is labeled as [FS] to 
indicate it as the MLR study.

3.2.2 Grey data collection  
Grey literature refers to the literature produced by government organizations, standards, business 
and industry which is not peer reviewed [36, 37]. We collected the grey (unpublished or non-peer 
reviewed) data based on the following steps:  

Search process for grey data 
The grey data are collected using the different search engines, websites and conducting manual 
search. The selected approaches are discussed as follow: 

Search through search engines  
To explore the grey literature, we used nine different digital sources. The selected sources include 
both  the  generic  search  engines  and  specialized  libraries  and  websites.  The  search  sources  are 
selected by considering the suggestions provided by  Garousi et al. [22] McGrath [38], Adams[39]. 
The  following  digital  sources  are  carefully  explored  by  executing  the  developed  search  string 
(section 3.2.1). 

•  “http://www.google.com” 
•  “https://www.bing.com” 
•  “http://www.opengrey.eu” 
• 
 “https://www.arxiv.org” 
•  “https://www.stackoverflow.com” 
•  “https://www.agilealliance.org” 
•  “https://www.istqb.org” 
•  “https://www.idc.com” 

Moreover, the grey literature was also collected from the professional social media networks such 
as  ResearchGate  (https://www.researchgate.net)  and  LinkedIn  (https://www.linkedin.com).  We 
also  approached  different  organizations  through  email  and  requested  the  data  relevant  to  the 

 
 
 
  
 
research questions of this study. The personal and professional Email IDs were collected from the 
organization websites and through our supervisor’s contacts in the software industry. We joined 
different available social media professional groups and send requests to provide unpublished data 
e.g.,  research  notes,  research  registers,  case  studies,  videos,  ppt.  presentations,  etc.  The 
respondents were assured that the collected data will only be used for research purposes and will 
keep confidential. The demographic details of the respondents are provided in Appendix-C.

Quality assessment criteria for grey literature 
The quality assessment process is performed to check the degree of credibility of the selected grey 
data. It is important to assess the quality of the data to measure its significance related to the study 
objectives. We develop a QA checklist for evaluating the significance of the grey data based on 
the suggestions presented in [22]. The checklist along the QA questions is provided in Table 2. 
The selected grey literature data are assessed based on the given checklist questions and the detail 
results are provided in Appendix-B.

Grey data collection process 
The search strings were executed in the selected search engines to extract the most relevant and 
appropriate  grey  data.  A  total  of  312  websites,  blogs,  and  webpages  were  summarized  after 
applying the data inclusion (section 3.2.2) and exclusion (section 3.2.2) criteria. We further filter 
the  data  sources  using    the  tollgate  approach  developed  by  Afzal  et  al.  [30].  The  step-by-step 
process  of  the  tollgate  approach  is  given  in  Figure  3.    After  applying  the  five  phases  of  data 
refinement process (Figure 3), finally, we collect the 37 data sources.  Besides, we apply manual 
search (as discussed section 3.2.2), and a total of 27 responses are received from the practitioners. 
We apply the similar steps of Figure 3 to refine the data collected from the practitioner and finally, 
15 responses were considered to include in the data extraction process.  Thought, through the grey 
data collection process, a total of (37+15=52) data sources were included in MLR. We provide the 
links of the webpages (Appendix-B) and the information of data collected through personal contact 
with practitioners in Appendix-C.  The personal contact should remain confidential according to 
the recommendation of respondents. The quality assessment process (i.e., discuss in section 3.2.2) 
is  performed  for  all  the  data  sets  and  the  results  are  provided  in  Appendix-B  and  Appendix-C 
respectively. Every selected data source is labeled with “GL” to indicate its use in MLR.   

Figure 3: Final selected grey data by employing the tollgate approach 

3.2.3 Data extraction  
We used the coding approach [40] to analyze the grey data and identify the success factors. The 
identified ideas, concepts, contribution or findings from the selected data were labeled, grouped 
and classified as the success factors with their respective frequency. The coding approach assists 
in analyzing the analytical data in which the success factors were identified with deep and effective 
analysis of qualitative data sets.  

 
 
 
 
 
Once the data extraction process is finalized, we conducted an inter-rater reliability test to examine 
the interpersonal bias. To do this, we request the three independent experts, and they selected 15 
data sources (10 published primary studies and five sources of grey literature). They performed all 
the  phases  of  data  collection  and  data  extraction.  We  determine  the  “Kendall’s  nonparametric 
coefficient  of  concordance  (W)”  to  measure  the  inter-rater  agreement  [30]  between  the  data 
extraction team and independent experts. The result, W = 0.84 (p = 0. 003), demonstrate agreement 
among the data extraction team and the independent experts, as shown in Table 3.

3.2.4 Data synthesis  
Finally,  we  identify  success  factors  based  on  the  data  extracted  from  formal  studies  and  grey 
literature. 
The  research  questions  were  assessed  against  the  extracted  data  from  both  data  sources.  The 
identified success factors are discussed in section 4.  

3.3 Reporting the review 
3.3.1 Quality assessment of primary selected studies. 
The quality of the selected data sources (primary studies and grey literature) was assessed to assure 
the degree of effectiveness of each data source. The quality assessment checklist discussed in Table 
1 and 2 were applied to selected data sets. The QA results show that 79% of the primary studies 
scored greater than 70%, and 93% of grey literature scored≥ 70%. The detailed QA results are 
provided in Appendix-A (formal primary studies), Appendix-B and Appendix C (grey literature).  

3.3.2 Review results 
The  identified  success  factors  of  the  CGSD  process  and  the  additional  analysis  is  discussed  in 
section 4.

SF3 (Time to market, 64%) has highest citation frequency. There is a need for “agility” in terms 
of  being  able  to  understand  and  adapt  the  trend  information  and  new  development  techniques 
[FS17].  For  example,  an  organization  can  use  a  business  intelligence  suite  to  get  real-time 
information  on  product  sales,  which  allows  management  to  adjust  their  strategy.  In  the  CGSD 
environment, the development teams are in a geographically distributed environment that assists 
in predicting the current market trend. Moreover, Weinhardt et al. [FS27] stated that CGSD, the 
distributed teams work parallels to develop the system components that minimize the time need to 
deliver the product in the market.  

SF18 (“Information safety and security”, 62%) was cited as the second highest frequency success 
factor for the management of CGSD. Yanosky et al. [FS30] emphasize significantly considering 
the  parameters  of  data  privacy  in  the  contract  signed  with  the  cloud  provider.  They  further 
suggested  four  key  points  manage  security  risks,  i.e.,  password  protection,  remote  access, 
encrypted data, network security, and backup data. Different other researchers have also indicated 
importance  of  information  security  in  the  CGSD  environment  [SF19,  43,  85].  Moreover,  Jain 
[FS47] recommended managing the backup files of the data that used across the cloud platform.    

SF15 (“Formalize relationship between overseas teams”, 60%) was specified as the third most 
cited success factor. In the CGSD process, the development phases are carried across distributed 
locations [FS43]. However, the software development activities demand rich communication and 
coordination channels between CGSD the teams which are significant to share frequent and instant 
information.  Yigitbasioglu  et  al.  [FS67]  highlighted  that  poor  communication  causes  the 
misinterpretation of software requirements and expectations that could be a potential barrier while 

 
 
 
managing the CGSD activities. Corney et al. [FS56] and Gonzalez et al. [128] also mentioned the 
importance of a strong and trustworthy relationship between the CGSD teams.  

SF2  (Continuous  development,  55%)  was  indicated  as  a  key  success  factor  for  the  CGSD 
environment. Garrison et al. [FS40] shown that it is critical to manage the continuous and round 
the clock development of the software activities. Rouse and Corbitt et al. [FS97] indicated that 
different time zones in the distributed environment has both negative and positive impacts at the 
same time. They further underlined that the time differences in different zones provide a positive 
edge to continuously and parallels perform the software development activities.   

SF24  (Reliable  support  structure,  54%)  was  also  cited  as  a  success  factor  for  the  successful 
execution of CGSD. To manage cloud services, an effective help desk should be established to 
help  practitioners  [SF39].  Gens  [FS58]  highlighted  that  for  the  maximum  utilization  of  cloud 
services, the outsourced  organization provides  a  skilled help  desk  to  the  practitioners.  Cardoso 
[FS72]  suggested  both  automated  (messages  on  the  systems  tabs)  and  manual  (support  team) 
support  desk.    Bennani  [FS61]  stated  that  the  demands  and  needs  of  the  practitioners  should 
address in-time and efficiently, which is important for the success of CGSD projects.  

SF5 (Financial restructuring, 51%) Leimeister et al. [FS16] stated that the main aim of software 
outsourcing  is  to  develop  a  product  at  a  low  cost  and  with  high  quality. Oliveira  et  al.  [FS36] 
highlighted that in the CGSD environment, the cost factor should manage concerning the nature 
of the development life cycle. Similarly, Siepmann [FS69] highlighted that the CGSD paradigm 
provides technological independence, which attributed that the CGSD need to spend low cost on 
technological intrastate but pay more for controlling the outsourcing activities. They further stated 
that the CGSD organization effectively manages the budget to handle the other concerns such as 
hidden costs, data backup, frequent communication etc.   

SF12  (Trust  building,  51%)  Trust  of  one  of  the  key  factors  that  are  critically  significant  for 
managing software development activities using a cloud platform. Tsai et al. [FS64] and Yin et al. 
[FS60] suggested that frequent communication and coordination opportunities should be arranged 
between the overseas practitioners to develop trust and work relationships. Ojala and Tyrvainen 
[FS49] further specified that due to the lack of trust, the practitioners hesitate to share the project 
related information and knowledge that could significantly impact the three key parameters of the 
project: schedule, quality, and budget.   

SF8  (Scalability,  50%)  Scalability  is  a  key  feature  of  cloud  infrastructure  [FS120].  Nuseibeh 
[FS74] highlighted that the cloud platform provides an opportunity to upscale or downscale the 
cloud resources. Cloud providers allow the client organizations to scale the resources as per project 
needs  and  requirements.  It  will  further  allow  CGSD  firms  to  support  business  growth  without 
expensive changes to their technological infrastructure [FS21, FS47, SF77].  

4.2 Client and vendor analysis  
A total of 82 data sources (published primary studies and grey literature) were considered in the 
domain  of  client  and  102  for  vendor  organizations.  The  investigated  success  factors  were 
categorized in client and vendor CGSD firms (Table 5). The Chi-square test was used to examine 
the significant differences between the investigated success factors from both client and vendor 

 
 
 
 
 
 
organizations’ perspective. Similar analysis has been applied in similar studies (e.g. [9, 31, 33, 34, 
41-45]). 

•  “Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the client and vendor 

CGSD organizations with respect to investigated success factors.”  

•  “Alternate hypothesis (H1): There are significant differences between the client and vendor 

CGSD organizations with respect to investigated success factors.” 

Null hypothesis (H0) “is accepted if the significance value of ‘P’ is >0.05 for any success factor; 
else, the alternative hypothesis H1.”

The results of the chi-square test presented in Table 5 shows that there are significant differences 
for only three factors: SF2 (continues development (around the clock), p=0.008), SF17 (uniform 
communication infrastructure, 0.041) and SF24 (reliable support structure, 0.034) and the Null 
hypothesis  is  only  accepted  for  the  given  three  factors.  We  noted  that  SF2  (continuous 
development) is highly considered in the client organization category. Tripathi and Parihar [FS66] 
mention that the client organizations outsourced their development activities across the world to 
minimize development time; therefore, they significantly considered the SF2. Hudaib et al. [FS31] 
and Bennan et al. [FS61] also highlighted that for improving the production efficiency, the client 
organizations should outsource their businesses to maximize the working hours.  SF17 (uniform 
communication infrastructure) has the highest frequency of occurrence in vendor organizations. 
Yang [FS71] underlined that in the CGSD environment, the development activities are conducted 
in  vendor  organizations,  and  the  practitioners  need  to  frequently  communicate  and  coordinate. 
Moreover,  Dutta  et  al.  [FS80]  emphasized  the  provision  of  proper  technological  and  social 
platforms to make the communication and coordination process more effective. 

Moreover,  SF5  (financial  restructuring,  52%,  and  49%),  SF6  (cost  assessment  and  budget 
allocation, 35%, and 32%), SF11 (consistent quality of services, 34%, and 32%), SF14 (apply the 
right 3P (people, processes and partners), 46% and 43%), SF19 (master storage disk of primary 
data,  30%  and  32%),  SF29  (hardware  and  infrastructure  independence,  30%  and  30%),  are 
declared  as  the  most  common  and  equally  important  success  factors  in  both  client  and  vendor 
organization.  The  CGSD  organization  should  strongly  focus  on  the  success  factors  which  are 
highly cited in their respective organization type.  

Figure 3: Mapping of success factors in Client-Vendor firms 

We  further  categorized  the  CGSD  success  factors  in  client  and  vendor  firms  considering  the 
framework  of  Ramasubu  [46].  Ramasubu  classify  the  GSD  process  improvement  barriers  in 
different domains. This conceptual mapping is also used by several other studies[31, 35]. Thus, 
we considered the same framework and map each success factor in both types of organizations, 
using their frequency of occurrence (Table 5) and the mapping results are given in Figure 3.  For 
instance, SF1 (Integration with organizational IT infrastructure) is considered by 26% and 34% by 
client and vendor organization, respectively. As SF1 has higher frequency of occurrence in vendor 

 
 
 
 
firms’ category, thus it is mapped with vendor organizations.  Using the same concept, all the 32 
identified success factors were mapped with client-vendor organizations and the mapping results 
are given in Figure 3.  
According to the mapping results 20 success factors are aligned with vendor organizations and 11 
are  with  client  organizations.  Interestingly,  SF18  (Information  safety  and  security)  has  equal 
frequency of occurrence in both types of organizations, this renders the SF18 is equally important 
for both types of organizations.  

4.3 Comparison of Formal and Grey literature  
We comparatively analyzed the two data sets (formal and grey literature) to evaluate the significant 
differences (Table 6). We calculate the rank of each factor based on the two data sets by taking the 
average value. The rank values of each factor were used to calculate the correlation between the 
two data sets. In this study, we used the Spearman rank-order correlation analysis to investigate 
the similarities and differences in both data sets [33].

Moreover, we applied the independent samples t-tests to assess the mean difference between both 
data sets (Tables 8 and 9). The t-test results (t = -2.200 and p = 0.062< 0.05) given in Table 8 
illustrate that there are more similarities than differences between the ranks obtained from both

and the data collected from the grey literature.  

Besides, we calculate the group statistics for both data sets to compare the mean difference between

4.4 Critical success factors  
The critical factor presents the core areas where the organizational management needs to pay more 
attention to successfully manage the development activities [9, 33, 45] because they indicate the 
critical  business  areas.  We  find  the  criticality  of  each  identified  factor  based  on  the  criteria 
developed by [38] i.e. 

•  Factor declared as critical if its frequency of occurrence is ≥50%. 

The  same  criteria  are  previously  adopted  by  various  researchers  in  other  software  engineering 
domains [31, 35, 45, 47]. Therefore, according to the frequency analysis (Table 3), the critically 
declared success factors of CGSD are:  

SF2 (continues development (around the clock), 55%), SF3 (time to market, 64%), SF5 (financial 
restructuring,  51%),  SF8  (scalability,  50%),  SF12  (trust  building,  52%),  SF15  (formalize 
relationship between overseas teams, 60), SF18 (information safety and security, 62%) and SF24 
(reliable support structure, 54%). 

4.5 Mapping of identified success factor with PMBOK Knowledge Areas  
Project  Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), an industry de-facto project  management 
guideline, has defined 10 knowledge areas that are recognized as good practices that can enhance 
successful management of a project [47]. Each knowledge area represents a set of core concepts 
and tasks that a project manager must consider to successfully manage project activities[48]. In 
this study, we mapped the identified success factors across the 10 PMBOK knowledge areas. We 
believe that this mapping will help a project manager to understand how the identified success 
factors are related to different aspects of managing CGSD projects.  

Three  researchers of the study were involved in  the mapping  activity in  which we labeled and 
classified the related success factors into relevant PMBOK knowledge areas, as shown in Figure 
5. A similar mapping process has been used by other studies (e.g.[49, 50]). We further conduct 
inter-rater reliability analysis to validate the mapping process.  Moreover, three external experts 
were invited to take part in the inter reliability test. We calculate the ‘non-parametric Kendalls 
coefficient  of  concordance  (W)’,[30]  to  calculate  the  inter-rater  agreement  between  both  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
mapping teams (i.e. authors and external experts). The coefficient of concordance value (W=0.91 
(p=0.003)) indicates agreement between the mappings of study researchers and external experts.  

The  mapping  shows  that  majority  of  identified  success  factors  are  related  to  procurement 
knowledge  area.  Three  success  factors  were  mapped  to  risk,  stakeholder,  time,  quality,  and 
communication  knowledge  areas.  Moreover,  only  one  success  factor  namely  ‘integration  with 
organizational IT infrastructure was mapped to the project integration management area.

5. Summary and Discussion  
5.1 Results Summary 
The alternate aim of this research work is to develop a readiness model which assists the software 
organization to assess and improve the capabilities related to CGSD. This study focusses only a 
single component of the proposed readiness model i.e. success factors of CGSD.   

RQ1:  What  are  the  success  factors  for  managing  CGSD  projects  as  identified  in  the 
multivocal literature review?  
Multivocal  literature  review  study  is  conducted  with  the  aim  to  explore  the  factors  that  could 
positively affect the CGSD practices. Using the step-by-step protocols of MLR, we finally selected 
132 formal studies and 52 pieces of grey literature. The selected literature  material was further 
considered for data extraction process and a list of 32 success factors was identified. The reported 
success  factor  highlights  the  key  areas  of  the  CGSD,  which  practitioners  need  to  focus  for 
successfully managing the development actives across the geographical boundaries.  

 
 
 
 
RQ2: Are there any differences between the success factors identified in the formal and grey 
literature? 
 The multivocal literature review approach has been adopted, where both formal and grey literature 
data is collected to explore the success factors of CGSD. The formal literature studies published 
in  academic  research  and  grey  literature  are  practitioner’s  experiences  reports,  blogs  and  case 
studies etc. The t-test and Spearman rank-order correlation test is applied to measure the statistical 
differences between the ranks of the reported factors for both formal and grey literature data sets. 
The t-test (t = -2.200 and p = 0.062< 0.05) and correlation (rS (32) =0.612) results discussed in 
section-4.3 reveal that there are no significant differences between the identified success factors 
in both formal and grey literature domain.  

RQ3: What success factors are related to CGSD vendor or client organizations? 
The  identified  factors  are  further  analyzed  with  respect  to  the  types  of  CGSD  organization. 
Considering the frequency of identified success factors, we performed the chi-square test to check 
the  significant  differences  between  the  success  factors  related  to  the  client  and  vendor  CGSD 
organizations. Based on the chi-square test results, we found significant differences between three 
success factors with respect to client-vendor classification i.e.SF2 (continues development (around 
the  clock),  p=0.008),  SF17  (uniform  communication  infrastructure,  0.041)  and  SF24  (reliable 
support structure, 0.034).    

Moreover, we noted that SF5 (financial restructuring, 52%, and 49%), SF6 (cost assessment and 
budget  allocation, 35%,  and 32%), SF11 (consistent  quality  of services, 34%, and 32%), SF14 
(apply the right 3P (people, processes and partners), 46% and 43%), SF19 (master storage disk of 
primary data, 30% and 32%), SF29 (hardware and infrastructure independence, 30% and 30%), 
are the most common reported success factors in client and vendor organization. 

RQ4: What success factors are related to 10 knowledge areas of PMBOK? 
The  identified  success  factors  are  further  mapped  in  the  10  knowledge  areas  of  project 
management.  The  aim  of  mapping  process  is  to  classify  the  factors  related  to  their  specific 
knowledge areas. The mapping results shows that majority of the success factors are scale in the 
procurement knowledge area.

Findings  
Total 32 factors are identified that could positively impact the global software 
development  activities  across  the  cloud  platform.  The  list  of  the  identified 
factors is provided in Table 4. 

Based on the frequency of occurrence in formal and grey literature, we found 
a  positive  correlation  rs  (32)  =  0.612.  In  addition,  the  results  of  the  t-test 
highlight that there are no significant differences in both data sets with respect 
to investigated success factors: (t = -2.200 and p = 0.062< 0.05). 
The  investigated  success  factors  are  categorized  with  respect  to  client  and 
vendor  organizations.  The  results  demonstrate  that  there  are  significant 
differences between the client and vendor organizations for only three success 
factors,  i.e.,  SF2  (Continuous  development,  p=0.008),  SF17  (Uniform

communication  infrastructure,  0.041)  and  SF24  (Reliable  support  structure, 
0.034). 
We classify the identified success factors into ten knowledge areas of PMBOK. 
The  results  shows  that  ‘procurement’  is  declared  as  the  most  significant 
knowledge area of investigated success factors.  

5.2. Study Implications and Future work 
The  findings  discussed  in  this  paper  makes  contributions  to  the  cloud  based  global  software 
development literature. First, in this study, we have carried out a multivocal literature review to 
identify the success factors for managing CGSD projects. The success factors are identified from 
both formal published literature and industry grey literature. The study also analyzes the success 
factors with respect to both client and vendor CGSD organizations’ perspectives. We believe that 
the  identified  success  factors  and  their  mapping  to  PMBOK  10  knowledge  areas  will  act  as  a 
knowledge  base  for  the  CGSD  research  community.  Moreover,  the  findings  of  the  study  will 
enhance the awareness of success factors associated with managing CGSD projects and will help 
researchers develop new strategies and frameworks to better manage the CGSD projects.  

The study also makes contribution to practical implications in the domain of CGSD projects. For 
example, the study indicates that procurement is one of key knowledge area of managing CGSD 
projects. Project managers need to focus on selection of cloud service provider, tailoring enterprise 
IT architecture to support cloud service and develop flexible governance models to manage CGSD 
projects. Similarly, project managers need to focus on managing risk, communication, time, and 
human resources knowledge areas to better manage a CGSD project. Moreover, practitioners need 
to develop strategies to better manage changing requirements in a CGSD project. In a nutshell the 
study  provides  a  deep  overview  of  both  academic  and  grey  literature  on  CGSD  project 
management, which has not been conducted before.  

The ultimate future of this study is the development of a readiness model for CGSD (RMCGSD) 
organizations  that  will  help  the  practitioners  to  measure  and  improve  the  cloud  based  global 
software  development  activities.  The  complete  architecture  of  proposed  model  (RMCGSD)  is 
provided in Figure 6 and it is based on the ideas of existing readiness models (like, SOPM[51], 
SOVRM[45], and CMMI[52]) and the factors that could impact the CGSD process. The RMCGSD 
consists  of  three  core  components,  i.e.,  readiness  level  component,  factors  component  (critical 
success  factors (CSFs),  critical  barriers (CBs)) and assessment component.  Figure 6 shows the 
association between the key components of RMCGSD. The readiness level component considered 
to assess the readiness level of a firm regarding the CGSD process, and the factors component 
consists  of  the  CSFs  and  CBs  that  represent  the  key  areas  of  CGSD  process.  The  assessment 
component  used  to  assess  the  specific  readiness  level  of  an  organization  and  suggest  the  best 
practices to boost the CGSD capabilities of a firm.  

Finding of this study will be used as one input to develop the readiness model, i.e., success factors 
of  CGSD.  Furthermore,  we  also  plan  to  conduct  a  MLR  study  to  identify  challenges  and  best 
practices associated with CGSD projects. To develop the readiness levels of proposed RMCGSD, 
we will conduct SLR, MLR and questionnaire survey study to collect the barriers of CGSD. We 
also  plan  to  conduct  MLR  and  empirical  study  (interview  and  questionnaire  survey)  aiming  to 
collect  the effective best  practices against each identified critical  success factor and barrier. At 
final stage, once we develop the readiness levels of RMCGSD, we will conduct case study with 

 
 
 
 
different organizations to check the implacability of RMCGSD in real-world industry. The same 
model development process is used other software engineering domains [35, 45, 53].

5.3. Study Limitations 
One potential threat toward the validity of this study findings is the incompleteness of a multivocal 
literature review. The findings of this paper are based on the literature extracted by using search 
keywords,  limited  digital  databases,  and  search  engines.  To  address  this  limitation,  we  use  the 
alternatives of the keywords to develop a strong search string. Moreover, we used different digital 
databases and search engines to explore maximum literature related to the study objectives.   Another 
possible limitation towards the validity of the study findings is the researcher’s biases in identifying 
and mapping the success factors into PMBOK knowledge areas. To address this threat, we performed 
an inter-rater reliability test to examine and minimize the researcher’s biases.   

6. Conclusion  
The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  identify  the  success  factors  which  explicitly  affect  the  global 
software  development  activities  using  the  cloud  platform.  We  conducted  an  MLR  study  and 
identified 32 success factors exploring 184 primary studies. Moreover, the identified factors are 
further analyzed with respect to client and vendor CGSD organizations. The study shows that there 
are significant differences between the three success factors, i.e., ‘continuous development (around 
the clock),’ ‘uniform communication infrastructure’ and ‘reliable support structure. We further 
map  the  identified  factors  with  client  and  vendor  organizations  considering  their  frequency  of 
occurrence.  We found that out  of  32  factors,  20  success  factors are  more relevant with  vendor 
organizations and 11 are with client organizations. The results shows that SF18 (Information safety 
and security) is equally important for both types of organizations. We further conducted a ranked 
based analysis based on the data collected form formal and grey literature, aiming to check which 
success factors is highlight reported in what category of data. The statistical results, correlation (rS 
(32) =0.612) t-test (t = -2.200 and p = 0.062< 0.05), there is no significant difference in frequency 
of occurrence of success factors in both types of data sets. Finally, the identified success factors 
are also scaled across the ten knowledge areas of the PMBOK framework. The mapping results 
show that procurement is the most significant knowledge area of the investigated success factors 
that need special focus of practitioners for successful CGSD projects.
