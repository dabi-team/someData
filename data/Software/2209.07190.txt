ABSTRACT
Given a discriminating neural network, the problem of fairness
improvement is to systematically reduce discrimination without
significantly scarifies its performance (i.e., accuracy). Multiple cat-
egories of fairness improving methods have been proposed for
neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing and post-
processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods
are not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying
the price of huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may
even worsen both fairness and accuracy). In this work, we pro-
pose an approach which adaptively chooses the fairness improving
method based on causality analysis. That is, we choose the method
based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for unfair-
ness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden
neurons. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is
effective (i.e., always identify the best fairness improving method)
and efficient (i.e., with an average time overhead of 5 minutes).

1 INTRODUCTION
Neural networks have found their way into a variety of systems,
including many which potentially have significant societal impact,
such as personal credit rating [18], criminal sentencing [6, 40], face
recognition [41] and resume shortlisting [39]. While these neural
networks often have high accuracy in these classification tasks,
some concerning fairness issues have been observed as well [8, 9,

13, 20, 40]. That is, the predictions made by these neural networks
may be biased with regard to certain protected attributes such as
sex, race, and gender. For instance, it has been shown [7] that a
neural network trained to predict people’s income level based on an
individual’s personal information (which can be used in applications
such as bank loan approval) is much more likely to predict male
individuals with high-income level. Further analysis shows that
for many individuals, changing only the gender or race causes the
output of the predictions to flip [21]. For another instance, it has
been shown [6] that a machine learning model used to predict the
recidivism risk for suspected criminals is more likely to mislabel
black defendants as having a high recidivism risk.

In recent years, many methods and tools have been proposed
to detect discrimination in neural networks systematically (e.g.,
through the so-called fairness testing [5, 21, 34, 44, 50]), and more
relevantly, to improve the fairness of neural networks [3, 12, 19, 23,
28–30, 37, 47]. In general, existing fairness improving methods can
be classified into three categories according to when the method
is applied, e.g., pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing
methods. Pre-processing methods [11, 19, 28, 46] aim to reduce the
bias in the training data so as to reduce the bias of model predictions;
in-processing methods [3, 4, 12, 30, 31, 47] focus on the model
and the training process; and post-processing methods [23, 29, 37]
modify the prediction results directly rather than the training data
or the model.

However, fairness improving is a complicated task and it is not
always clear which method should be applied. As shown in Sec-
tion 3, different fairness improving methods perform significantly
differently on different models (which is consistent with the par-
tial results reported in [8, 13, 20]). More importantly, applying the
‘wrong’ method would not only lead to a huge loss in accuracy (e.g.,
the accuracy of the model trained on the COMPAS dataset drops
by 35% after applying the Reject Option post-processing method),
but also lead to worsened fairness. For instance, out of 90 cases (i.e.,
combinations of model, protected attribute and fairness improv-
ing method) that we examined in Section 3, 20% of them result in
worsened fairness. Furthermore, a fairness improving method may
be effective with respect to one protected attribute whilst being
harmful with respect to another protected attribute. For instance,
the fairness of the model trained on Adult Income dataset improves
by around 4% with respect to the gender attribute after applying the
Equalized Odds post-processing method and worsens by 20% with
respect to the race attribute. Given that many of the fairness im-
proving methods require significant effort and computing resource,
it is infeasible to try all of them and identify the best performing
one. It is thus important to have a systematic way of identifying
the ‘right’ method efficiently.

In this work, we propose to choose the ‘right’ fairness improv-
ing method based on causality analysis. Intuitively, the idea is to

conduct causality analysis so as to understand the causes of the
discrimination, i.e., whether a certain number of input attributes
or hidden neurons are highly responsible for the unfairness. For-
mally, we use the probability of high causal effects and Coefficient
of Variation to characterize the distribution of the causal effects.
Depending on the result of the causality analysis, we then choose
the fairness improving method accordingly. For instance, if a small
number of input attributes bare most of the responsibility for un-
fairness, a pre-processing method such as [19, 28] would be the
choice, whereas an in-processing method would be the choice if
some neurons are highly responsible. Our approach is designed
based on the results of an empirical study which evaluates 9 fairness
improving methods (i.e., 2 pre-processing methods, 4 in-processing
methods and 3 post-processing methods) on 4 different benchmark
datasets with respect to different fairness metrics. Our approach is
systematically evaluated with the same models. The results show
that our selected processing approach is the optimal choice to im-
prove group fairness in all cases and the optimal choice to reduce
individual discrimination in most cases.

The remainders of the paper are organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we review relevant background. In Section 3, we present
results from our empirical study which motivates our approach.
In Section 4, we present our adaptive fairness improving method.
In Section 5, we evaluate our approach. Lastly, we review related
work in Section 7 and conclude in Section 8.

2 BACKGROUND
In the following, we review relevant background on fairness and
existing fairness improving methods.

2.1 Fairness Definitions
In the literature, there are multiple definitions of fairness [10, 17,
21, 27, 33, 45]. What is common across different definitions is that
to define fairness, we must first identify a set of protected attributes
(a.k.a. sensitive attributes). Commonly recognized protected at-
tributes instance race, sex, age and religion. Note that different
models may have different protected attributes.

In the following, we introduce two popular definitions of fair-
ness, i.e., group fairness and individual discrimination, as well as the
corresponding fairness scores, i.e., metrics that are used to quantify
the degree of unfairness.

Group fairness, also known as statistical fairness, focuses on certain
protected groups such as ethnic minority and the parity across
different groups based on some statistical measurements. It is the
primary focus of this study as well as many existing studies [7,
24, 32, 42, 49]. Classic measurements for group fairness include
positive classification rate and true positive rate. A classifier satis-
fies group fairness if the samples in the protected groups have an
equal or similar positive classification probability or true positive
probability.

Given a model, we can measure its degree of unfairness according

to group fairness using Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) [10]1.

1There are also alternative similar measures such as Disparate Impact [45] that we
omit in this study.

Definition 2.1 (Statistical Parity Difference). Let 𝑌 be the predicted
output of the neural network 𝑁 ; 𝑙 be a (favorable) prediction and 𝐹
be a protected attribute. Statistical Parity Difference is the difference
in the probability of favorable outcomes between the unprivileged
and privileged groups where the unprivileged/privileged groups
are defined based on the value of the protected attribute.

|𝑃 [𝑌 = 𝑙 | 𝐹 = 0] − 𝑃 [𝑌 = 𝑙 | 𝐹 = 1]|

(1)

Note that the above definition only considers a single binary
protected attribute, which is sometimes insufficient. The following
metric, called Group Discrimination Score (GDS), extends SPD to
measure fairness based on multiple protected attributes.

Definition 2.2 (Group Discrimination Score). Let 𝑁 be a neural
network; 𝑌 be the predicted output of the neural network; 𝑙 be a
(favorable) prediction, and 𝐹 be a set of (one or more) protected
attributes. Let 𝜃 (and 𝜃 ′) be an arbitrary valuation of the protected
attributes 𝐹 . Let 𝑋𝜃 be the set of inputs whose 𝐹 -attribute values
are 𝜃 . Let 𝑃𝜃 be 𝑃 (𝑁 (𝑥) = 𝑙 | 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝜃 ). The multivariate group dis-
crimination with respect to protected attributes 𝐹 is the maximum
difference between any 𝑃𝜃 and 𝑃𝜃 ′.
Example Consider the structured dataset Adult Income [38]. It has
two protected attributes, i.e., gender, and race. Each attribute has a
set of two values, i.e., Female or Male for gender, and White or non-
White for race. As a result, there are 4 possible 𝜃 , i.e., (Male, White),
(Female, White), (Male, non-White) and (Female, non-White). The
probabilities of an individual who is predicted to have a high-income
level (i.e., more than 50K) with respect to these four 𝜃 is 14.4%, 39.6%,
9.0% and 28.5% respectively. The GDS of the model is thus 30.6%.

Individual discrimination is another concept which is often applied
in fairness analysis. It focuses on specific pairs of individuals. Intu-
itively, individual discrimination occurs when two individuals that
differ by only certain protected attribute(s) are predicted with dif-
ferent labels. An individual whose label changes once its protected
attribute(s) changes is referred to as an individual discriminatory
instance.

Definition 2.3 (Individual Discriminatory Instance). Let 𝐹 be a set
of (one or more) protected attributes; and 𝑁 be a neural network. 𝑥
is an individual discriminatory instance if there exists an instance
𝑥 ′ such that the following conditions are satisfied.

• ∀𝑞 ∉ 𝐹 . 𝑥𝑞 = 𝑥 ′
𝑞
• 𝑁 (𝑥) ≠ 𝑁 (𝑥 ′)

The above definition is often adopted in fairness testing, i.e.,
works on searching or generating individual discriminatory in-
stances [44, 50]. In addition, there are proposals on learning models
which are more likely to avoid individual discriminatory [40].

Given a model, we can measure its fairness according to indi-
vidual discrimination by measuring the percentage of individual
discriminatory instances in a set of instances (which can be the test
set or a set generated to simulate unseen samples), formally called
Causal Discrimination Score (CDS).

Definition 2.4 (Causal Discrimination Score). Let 𝑁 be a neural
network; 𝐹 be a set of protected attributes. The causal discrimina-
tion score of 𝑁 with respect to protected attributes 𝐹 , is the fraction
of inputs which are individual discrimination instances.

2.2 Fairness Improving Methods
Many methods have been proposed to improve the fairness of
neural networks [3, 4, 11, 12, 19, 23, 28–31, 37, 46, 47]. They can be
categorized into three groups according to when they are applied,
i.e., pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing.

Pre-processing methods aim to reduce the discrimination and
bias in the training data so as to improve the fairness of the trained
model. Among the many pre-processing methods [11, 19, 28, 46],
we focus on the following two representatives in this work.

• Reweighing (RW) [28] works by assigning different weights to
training samples in order to reduce the effect of data biases. In
particular, lower weights are assigned to favored inputs which
have a higher chance of being predicted with the favorable label
and higher weights are assigned to deprived inputs.

• Disparate Impact Remover (DIR) [19] is based on the disparate
impact metric which compares the proportion of individuals that
are predicted with the favorable label for an unprivileged group
and a privileged group. It modifies the values of the non-protected
attribute to remove the bias from the training dataset.

In-processing methods modify the model in different ways to
mitigate the bias in the model predictions [3, 4, 12, 30, 31, 47]. We
focus on the following representative in-processing methods in this
work.

• Classification with fairness constraints (META) [12] develops a
meta-algorithm which captures the desired metrics of group fair-
ness (e.g., GDS), using convex fairness constraints (with strong
theoretical guarantees) and then using the constraints as an ad-
ditional loss function for training the neural network.

• Adversarial debiasing (AD) [47] modifies the original model by in-
cluding backward feedback for predicting the protected attribute.
It maximizes the predictors’ ability for classification while mini-
mizing the adversary’s ability to predict the protected attribute
to mitigate the bias.

• Prejudice remover regularizer (PR) [30] focuses on the indirect
prejudge. It uses regularizers to compute and restrict the effect
of the protected attributes.

• Exponential gradient reduction (GR) [3] reduces the fair clas-
sification problem to a sequence of cost-sensitive classification
problems, whose solutions yield a randomized classifier with the
lowest empirical error subject to the desired constraints.

Post-processing methods modify the prediction results instead
of the inputs or the model. We consider three representative pro-
cessing algorithms in this work.

3 AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
In this section, we present an empirical study which aims to com-
pare the performance of different fairness improving methods on
different models, different protected attributes or attribute combi-
nations.

3.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets Our experiments are based on 4 models trained with
the following benchmark datasets: Census Income [38], German
Credit [25], Bank Marketing [35] and COMPAS [6]. These datasets
have been used as the evaluation subjects in multiple previous
studies [15, 21, 34, 40, 49, 50].

• Adult Income: The prediction task of this dataset is to determine
whether the income of an adult is above $50,000 annually. The
dataset contains more than 30,000 samples. The attributes 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 ,
𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 are protected attributes.

• German Credit: This is a small dataset with 600 samples. The task
is to assess an individual’s credit based on personal and financial
records. The attributes 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 and 𝑎𝑔𝑒 are protected attributes.
• Bank Marketing: The dataset contains more than 45,000 samples
and is used to train models for predicting whether the client
would subscribe a term deposit. Its only sensitive attribute is 𝑎𝑔𝑒.
• COMPAS: The COMPAS Recidivism dataset contains more than
7,000 samples and is used to predict whether the recidivism risk
score for an individual is high. The attributes 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 , 𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 are
protected attributes.

In our experiment, we define privileged and unprivileged groups
based on the default setting in [7]. The details of the privileged
group definitions and favorable class are summarised at Table 1.
Altogether, we have a total of 10 model-attribute combinations. Our
implementation of the 9 fairness improving methods is based on
the AIF360 implementation [7]. Each implementation is manually
reviewed and tested through standard practice.

• Equalized Odds (EO) [23] solves a linear program to find proba-
bilities with which to change the output labels, so as to optimize
equalized odds on protected attributes.

• Calibrated Equalized Odds (CEO) [37] optimizes over calibrated
classifier score outputs to find probabilities with which to change
output labels with an equalized odds objective.

• Reject Option Classification (RO) [29] assigns favorable labels
to unprivileged instances and unfavorable labels to privileged
instances around the decision boundary with the highest uncer-
tainty.

Model Training Our models are feed-forward neural networks,
which are shown to be highly accurate and efficient in these real-
world classification problems [1, 26, 48]. All these neural networks
contain five hidden layers, each of which contains 64, 32, 16, 8 and
4 units. The output layer contains 2 (number of predict classes)
units. For each dataset, we split the data into 70% training data and
30% test data. All experiments are conducted on a server running
Ubuntu 1804 operating system with 1 Intel Core 3.10GHz CPU,
32GB memory and 2 NVIDIA GV102 GPU. To mitigate the effect
of randomness, whenever relevant, we set the same random seed

for each test. The trained models reach standard state-of-the-art
accuracy. The trained results including the corresponding fairness
scores are shown in Table 2. Note that SPD is the probability dif-
ference between the unprivileged and privileged groups which is
defined on a single protected attribute and thus it is irrelevant if
multiple protected attributes are considered simultaneously.

3.2 Evaluation Results
In the following, we present the results of the empirical study, which
aims to answer the following research questions.

RQ1: Do the fairness improving methods always improve group fair-
ness? To answer the question, we systematically apply all fairness
improving methods on all the model-attribute combinations and
measure the effectiveness of the fairness improving methods. We
measure the group fairness improvement as follows. SPD is adopted
if a single protected attribute is relevant and GDS is adopted if mul-
tiple protected attributes are considered at the same time. Note that
GDS is the same as SPD with respect to a single protected attribute.
The results are shown in Figure 1, where there is one bar for
each model-attribute combination and for each fairness improving
method, i.e., a total of 9 bars for each model-attribute combination
(e.g., Adult-gender) and 90 bars in total. A positive value means
improved fairness and a negative value means worsened fairness.
This bar is shown in 9 different colors for the nine different methods.
First of all, to our surprise, the fairness improving methods are
not always helpful in terms of improving fairness. As shown in
Figure 1, while many methods have a positive effect in many cases,
there are many instances where applying fairness improving method
results in worsened fairness, sometimes quite significantly. This is
shown as the colorful bar before the zero line, which accounts for a
total of 18 cases (i.e., 20%). Most of those cases are for in-processing
and post-processing methods.

Furthermore, the performance of the methods varies significantly
across different models and protected attributes. Table 3 shows a
summary on which method achieves the most fairness improve-
ment for each model-attribute combination and it can be observed
that different winners are there for different model-attribute com-
binations. Further analysis shows the performance of the fairness
improving methods vary across many dimensions. First, the perfor-
mance of the same method varies significantly on different models.

For instance, while the post-processing method CEO works effec-
tively for the neural network trained on Adult Income dataset,
it is ineffective for the model trained on German Credit dataset.
Secondly, the performance of the methods varies across different
attributes in the same model. For instance, the post-processing
method EO improves the group fairness with respect to gender
attribute effectively but leads to worse group fairness with respect
to race attribute for the neural network trained on Adult Income
dataset.

Moreover, even the processing methods in the same category
behave differently on the same model-attribute combination. In
terms of in-processing methods, RW is much more effective than
DIR. All models’ group fairness can be improved by RW, whereas
DIR is ineffective with respect to Credit-gender and COMPAS-race.
For in-processing methods, GR is most effective in improving group
fairness for all model-attribute combinations except Credit-age. The
performance of Post-processing methods varies significantly. For
example, the post-processing method RO is much more effective
in improving the group fairness for the neural network trained on
COMPAS dataset than CEO and EO.

There are some conjectures on why fairness improvement ap-
proaches may have different effects on different models and differ-
ent model-attribute combinations. The main reason is that these
methods improve fairness based on certain metrics which may be
subtly different from common notions of fairness such as SPG, GDS
and CDS. For instance, CEO focuses on reducing False Positive
Rate difference in particular, which sometimes translates to fairness
measured using SPG/GDS/CDS (as for the Adult Income dataset)
and sometimes not. For the different performances on different
model-attribute combinations, there may be two reasons. The first
is that the discrimination against different attributes in the model
may be very different (see in Table 2 and observed in [8]). The
second possible reason is that the reasons of the discrimination
against different attributes may be different, e.g., biased training
data or biased models.

Answer to RQ1: Existing fairness improving meth-
ods are not always effective in improving group fair-
ness and thus they must be applied with caution.

RQ2: What is the cost on accuracy when applying existing fairness im-
proving methods? The results are shown in Figure 2, where there is
similarly one bar for each model-attribute combination and for each

Figure 2: Accuracy Changes of Models with respect to Different Protected Attributes After Processing

fairness improving method. A positive value indicates an increased
accuracy and a negative value indicates a decreased accuracy.

First of all, we observe that some of the fairness improving meth-
ods may indeed incur a significant loss of accuracy. This is most
observable on META, PR, CEO, EO and RO. Especially for the neu-
ral network trained on the COMPAS dataset, the accuracy drops
more than 40% after applying META, PR or RO. The average loss
of accuracy is around 13% after processing by META and 12% after
processing by RO. To our surprise, some of the fairness improving
methods result in improved accuracy in some cases. This is most
observable in some in-processing methods. Especially for the neu-
ral network trained on the German Credit dataset, the accuracy
increases after applying all four in-processing methods. It should
be noted however most of these in-processing methods have a
less or harmful effect in terms of group fairness improvement in
these cases. For example, while the accuracy increases by 4% after
applying GR on Credit-age, the SPD fairness score worsens by 6%.
The accuracy reduction varies across not only different model-
attribute combinations, but also different methods across different

categories. Compared fairness improving methods from different
categories, the pre-processing methods have an overall mild impact
on the model accuracy. In terms of the most effective pre-processing
method RW, it is effective on group fairness improvement with
respect to all model-attribute combinations and scarifies little accu-
racy. In terms of the most effective in-processing method GR, it is
effective on group fairness improvement with respect to all model-
attribute combinations except Credit-age (although sometimes with
minimal fairness improvement). Among them, 7 neural networks
get lower accuracy after processing. But the accuracy drops less
than 1% in average. In terms of the post-processing method RO, it
is effective on group fairness improvement with respect to 7 model-
attribute but 5 neural networks get lower accuracy after processing.
Especially for the neural network trained on COMPAS dataset, the
accuracy drops more than 30%, which is unacceptable.

Answer to RQ2: Existing fairness improving meth-
ods may incur a significant loss in accuracy.

Figure 3: Comparison between group fairness improvement and individual discrimination reduction

RQ3: Do the fairness improving methods perform differently for im-
proving group fairness and reducing individual discrimination? Al-
most all existing fairness improving methods focus on group fair-
ness (whilst some fairness testing approaches focus on individual
discrimination for some reason). Thus we are curious about whether
the existing fairness improving methods can reduce individual dis-
crimination as well. To answer this question, we compare the CDS
change against the group fairness metric change achieved by the
same method. The idea is to check whether the changes are con-
sistent, i.e., whether an improvement in group fairness leads to a
reduction in individual discrimination and vice versa. Note that, by
the default setting in [7], the DIR pre-processing method removes
all protected attributes, which makes individual discrimination
irrelevant, and thus is not considered in this experiment.

The results are shown in Figure 3, where the CDS change is
placed next to the fairness metric change for each fairness im-
proving method. First of all, the group fairness improvement and
individual discrimination reduction are inconsistent. A method im-
proving the group fairness effectively might have none or even
harmful effect on individual fairness. This is most observable on
RW and RO. The pre-processing method RW is effective on group
fairness improvement for all models but lead to more individual dis-
crimination for 8 model-attribute combinations. After applying the
post-processing method RO, the individual discrimination worsens
for all model-attribute combinations.

Furthermore, only the in-processing methods consistently reduce
individual discrimination. In terms of META method, it increases
the group fairness and reduces the individual discrimination at the
same time for 8 model-attribute combinations. The method AD
reduces the individual discrimination with respect to all protected
attributes in Adult Income dataset and German Credit dataset. Es-
pecially for the neural network trained on Adult Income dataset, all
in-processing methods improve the individual fairness effectively.
By contrary, all post-processing methods have harmful effect on

individual discrimination. on average, the CDS worsens by around
19% after applying CEO, worsens by 24% after applying EO and
worsens by more than 18% with RO.

Answer to RQ3: Existing methods are less effective
in reducing individual discrimination.

4 AN ADAPTIVE APPROACH
Our empirical study shows that the performance of fairness im-
proving methods varies significantly across different models, i.e.,
sometimes resulting in worsened fairness and/or reduced accuracy.
We thus need a systematic way of choosing the right method. Our
proposal is an adaptive approach based on causality analysis. In-
tuitively, causality analysis measures the “responsibility” of each
neuron and input attributes towards the unfairness, and depending
on whether the most responsible neurons are in the hidden layers
or at the input layer, as well as whether a small number of them
are significantly more responsible than the rest. Then we choose
the fairness improving method accordingly. In the following, we
present the details of our approach.

4.1 Causality Analysis
Causality analysis aims to identify the presence of causal relation-
ships among events. Furthermore, it can be used to quantify the
causal influence of an event on another event. To conduct causality
analysis on neural networks, we first adopt the approach in [14, 42],
and treat neural networks as Structured Causal Models (SCM). For-
mally,

Definition 4.1 (Structure Causal Model). A Structure Causal Model
consists of a set of endogenous variables 𝑋 and a set of exogenous
variables 𝑈 connected by a set of functions 𝐹 that determine the
values of the variables in 𝑋 based on the values of the variables

in 𝑈 . The neural network corresponding SCM can be represented
as a 4-tuple Model 𝑀 (𝑋, 𝑈 , 𝐹, 𝑃𝑈 ), where 𝑃𝑈 is the probability of
□
distribution over 𝑈 .

For the neural network, the endogenous variables 𝑉 are observed
variables, e.g., attributes or neurons. The exogenous variables are
the unobserved random variables, e.g., noise, and 𝑃𝑈 is the possible
distribution of the exogenous variables. Trivially, an SCM can be
represented by a directed graphical model 𝐺 = (𝑋, 𝐸), where 𝐸 is
the causal mechanism.

Based on SCM, the causal effect of a certain event can be com-
puted as the difference between potential outcomes under different
treatments. In this work, we adopt the Average Causal Effect (ACE)
as the measurement of the causal effect [14, 42]2. The formal defini-
tions of ACE are shown below (where it is assumed that the input
endogenous variables are not correlated to each other).

𝐴𝐶𝐸𝑦

Definition 4.2 (Average Causal Effect). The ACE of a given en-
dogenous variable 𝑥 with value 𝛼 on output 𝑦 can be measured
as:

𝑑𝑜 (𝑥=𝛼) = E [𝑦 | 𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 𝛼)] − 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑥
(2)
where E [𝑦 | 𝑑𝑜 (𝑥𝑖 = 𝛼)] represents the interventional expecta-
tion which is the expected value of 𝑦 when the random variable
𝑥 is set to 𝛼; and 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑥 is the average ACE of 𝑥 on 𝑦, i.e.,
E𝑥 (cid:2)E𝑦 [𝑦 | 𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = 𝛼)](cid:3) 3.
□

Following the recent work reported in [42], we apply ACE to
capture the causal influence on model fairness. That is, the 𝑦 in
Equation 2 should be a measure of the model unfairness, i.e., SPR,
GDS or CDS. For simplicity, we denote it as 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 .

In order to analyze the causal effect on fairness, we analyze
two possible causal effects, i.e., the relationship between input
attributes to unfairness, and the relationship between the hidden
neurons to unfairness. In this work, we make use of the average
interventional expectation to approximate the ACE of variable 𝑥
to 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 . Formally, 𝐴𝐶𝐸
represents the ACE of variable 𝑥
under value 𝛼 to the fairness property 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 . One complication is
that each input attribute or neuron has many possible values and
we must consider all the possible values in computing the ACE. Our
remedy is to consider the average Interventional Expectation (AIE).

𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟
𝑑𝑜 (𝑥=𝛼)

Definition 4.3 (Average Interventional Expectation). Let 𝑥 be the
given endogenous variable, 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 be the fairness property and
𝑣𝑎𝑙_𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑥 be a set of values of variable 𝑥. The average interven-
tional expectation is the mean of expected values of 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 when 𝑥
is set to be each value 𝛼:

(cid:205)𝛼 ∈𝑣𝑎𝑙_𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑥

(3)

For the input features with categorical values, we intervene the
feature with every possible value based on the training dataset.
For the hidden neurons with continuous value, intervening it with
every possible value might be consuming. We thus intervene the
neurons as follows which is adopted in [14] as well. That is, we
assume the “intervener” is equally likely to perturb variable 𝑥 to any
value 𝛼 within the input range, so that 𝛼 ∼ 𝑈 (𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥 , 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑥 ), where

2There are alternative ones such as the gradient of causal attribution [36] which work
slightly differently.
3or alternatively it can be E [𝑦 | 𝑑𝑜 (𝑥 = ^𝑥) ] where ^𝑥 is the selected significant point.

𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑥 are the minimum and maximum input values of 𝑥.
In practice, 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑥 can be obtained by observing the value
of the input attribute or neuron given all the training samples and
the 𝑣𝑎𝑙_𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑥 is generated by partitioning the range [𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥 , 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑥 ]
uniformly into a fixed number of intervals. Note that if a specific
distribution of the interventions is given, it can be used to generate
the intervention values instead.

The details of causality analysis on the hidden neurons are shown
in Algorithm 1. Given a neural network 𝑁 , a set of inputs 𝐷 (i.e.,
the training set), a hidden neuron 𝑛 and the function for measuring
the desired fairness score 𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 _𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐, we systematically measure
the AIE with neuron intervention. At line 1 and line 2, we set
𝑚𝑖𝑛 to the minimum output of 𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥 to the maximum output
of 𝑛. Then we generate a set of evenly spaced numbers within
the domain of the neuron output [𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝑚𝑎𝑥] as 𝑣𝑎𝑙_𝑠𝑒𝑡 through
function 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒_𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑠 at line 3. The input parameter 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙
decides how many intervals are there. From line 4 to 8, we calculate
the AIE with each perturbing value 𝛼. In each round, we first set 𝑖𝑒
as an empty set at line 5 and then calculate the fairness score 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟
whilst fixing the value of neuron 𝑛 as 𝛼. At line 9, we return the
mean of all Interventional Expectation as the AIE.

Algorithm 2 similarly conducts causality analysis on the input
attributes. The only difference is that we perform the intervention
on the given attribute 𝑓 at line 4 with all possible values of the
attribute.

4.2 Adaptive Fairness Improvement
Once we compute the causal effect of each neuron and each input
attribute on fairness (i.e., responsibility for unfairness), we can then

ESEC/FSE ’22, November 14–18, 2022, Singapore, Singapore

Mengdi Zhang and Jun Sun

adaptively select the fairness improving methods. For example, if
the causal effects of input attributes are relatively high, the unfair-
ness is more likely to be related to the input attributes and likely to
be eliminated by pre-processing methods. Similarly, if the interior
neurons in the neural network have high causal effects on the fair-
ness property, in-processing methods might be a suitable choice
for fairness improvement.

Formally, to properly compare the casual effects of neurons and
input attributes, we first normalize it with respect to a baseline
𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 , which is the fairness score based on the desired fairness
metric without any intervention. The baseline 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 can be SPD,
GDS and CDS as discussed previously.

We define the causal effects higher than the basic fairness prop-
erty as high causal effects and vice versa. In other words, only the
variable with a causal effect higher than the basic fairness property
has the positive causality to unfairness. That is, we only consider
those neurons and attributes with a causal effect higher than 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟
as responsible. Next, we measure the proposition of input attributes
and neurons that are considered responsible. Given the set of causal
effects of all attribute 𝐴𝐼 𝐸𝑓 and the set of causal effects of all neu-
rons 𝐴𝐼𝐸𝑛, we formally denote the proportion of high causality
attributes as 𝑃𝑓 and the proportion of high causality neurons as 𝑃𝑛
and define them as follows.

𝑃𝑓 = 𝑃 (𝐴𝐼𝐸 > 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 | 𝐴𝐼 𝐸 ∈ 𝐴𝐼 𝐸𝑓 )

(4)

𝑃𝑛 = 𝑃 (𝐴𝐼𝐸 > 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 | 𝐴𝐼 𝐸 ∈ 𝐴𝐼 𝐸𝑛)

(5)
Furthermore, we measure the distribution of the “responsibility”
among the input attributes and neurons, since it intuitively has an
impact on which fairness improving method should be chosen. For
instance, if all input attributes have similar responsibility for un-
fairness, it is likely hard to pre-process the inputs so as to eliminate
the discrimination. Similarly, if all neurons are equally responsible
for unfairness, it is complex to improve the fairness by focusing
on a few neurons as in [42]. Formally, we use the Coefficient of
Variation (CV) to capture the distribution of the causal effects. CV
is used to measure the dispersion of data points around the mean.
It represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean which
indicates the degree of variation. In this setting, the larger the CV,
the more uneven the distribution of causal effects. We denote the
CV of attributes as 𝐶𝑉𝑓 and the CV of neurons as 𝐶𝑉𝑛.

The details of how to select fairness improving methods are
shown in algorithm 3. If both the proportion of responsible at-
tributes and responsible neurons is less than a proportion threshold
𝑃_𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠, few input attributes and neurons are to be blamed for
the unfairness. As a result, it is unlikely pre-processing (which
focuses on input attributes) or in-processing (which focuses on
the hidden neurons) is effective, and thus we choose to apply the
post-processing methods. In practice, we set the threshold 𝑃_𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠
to be 10%. Otherwise, there are sufficient number of input attributes
or neurons that are responsible for unfairness, we then select to
apply a pre-processing method if 𝐶𝑉𝑓 > 𝐶𝑉𝑛, i.e., the distribution
of causal effects is more uneven in the input attributes which means
that some of the input attributes are more responsible. Otherwise,
an in-processing method is chosen. For pre-processing methods,
RW is preferred over DIR, as RW is also feasible to individual
fairness metrics. For in-processing methods and post-processing

methods, we choose the method with the best improvement and
least accuracy cost.

Example For the neural network trained on Adult Income dataset,
assume that the protected attribute is the “gender” attribute. Ac-
cording to the above discussion, we use the group fairness metric
SPD to calculate the causal effects of attributes and neurons. The
causality analysis result is shown in Figure 4, where each dot rep-
resents the AIE of either an input attribute or a hidden neuron.
We mark the causal effects of input attributes with black dots and
mark the causal effects of hidden neurons in different layers with
different colors. The dotted line marks the baseline 𝑦𝑓 𝑎𝑖𝑟 which is
0.249. There are 3 (i.e., 25%) attributes with causal effects higher
than the baseline and 33 (i.e., 26.6%) neurons with causal effects
higher than the baseline. As the proportion of responsible input
attributes and neurons satisfy the threshold, we then calculate the
CV values of those responsible attributes and neurons. The 𝐶𝑉𝑓 of
these 3 attributes is 0.041 and the 𝐶𝑉𝑛 of these 33 neurons is 0.152.
Since 𝐶𝑉𝑛 > 𝐶𝑉𝑓 , we choose to apply in-processing methods so as
to improve the model’s group fairness.

5 IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our adaptive ap-
proach systematically to answer multiple research questions. Note
that the same datasets, models, and the configuration from Section 3

are used in this section.

Table 4: Distribution of high causal effects with Group Fair-
ness

RQ1: How are the “responsibility” distributed among the neurons and
input attributes To answer this question, we show the probability
of high causal effects and CV of these causal effects for both the
hidden neurons and input attributes in Table 4 and Table 5. The first
column is the training dataset and the second column shows the
corresponding protected attribute(s) in each dataset. Then we show
the probability of attributes with high causal effects 𝑃𝑓 , the proba-
bility of neurons with high causal effects 𝑃𝑛, CV on highly causal
attributes 𝐶𝑉𝑓 and CV on highly causal neurons 𝐶𝑉𝑛. It can be
observed that the distribution of responsibility varies significantly
across different model-attribute combinations, which potentially
explains why only some fairness improving methods are effective
sometimes.

Table 4 shows the distribution of high causal effects based on
group fairness metrics, e.g., SPD for single protected attributes and
GDS for multivariate protected attributes. Based on algorithm 3,
the selected processing categories are shown in the last column.
For all attribute(s) in Adult Income dataset, the probabilities of
high causal effects are higher than 10% and 𝐶𝑉𝑛 scores are higher
than 𝐶𝑉𝑓 scores. So we decide to apply pre-processing methods to
this model to improve the group fairness for all attributes. For the
neural network trained on German Credit dataset with respect to
all attributes, we conclude to apply pre-processing methods. For
example, with respect to age attribute, both the proportion and
the CV of high causal neurons are lower than the two of high
causal attributes. Similarly, based on the distribution of high causal
effects, we conclude to apply pre-processing to the neural network
trained on Bank dataset and the neural network trained on COMPAS
dataset with respect to gender and race attributes. With respect to
gender+race attribute in COMPAS dataset, as the CV of neurons is
higher, we conclude to apply in-processing methods.

Table 5 show the distribution of high causal effects based on
individual fairness metrics, e.g., CDS. The selected processing cate-
gories are shown in the last column. Similarly, Algorithm 3 decides
to apply in-processing methods for all model-attribute combina-
tions, expect Credit-gender and Bank-age. We can observe that the
proportion of high causal effects of attributes might be 0% in some
cases, e.g., COMPAS-gender and COMPAS-race, which means no
attribute is responsible for individual discrimination.

Note that, post-processing methods are selected only if both the
proportions of responsible neurons/attributes are low, as it often
has a significant negative impact on model performance (so that
it is impossible to improve fairness through pre-processing or in-
processing). In our experiments, however, all the neural networks
have sufficiently many responsible neurons/attributes, so no post-
processing method is adopted.

RQ2: Are we always able to identify the best performing fairness
improvement method? To answer this question, we compare our
adaptive approach against the best performing pre-processing, in-
processing and post-processing method in four ways.

• One is the group fairness improvement, which is shown in Fig-

ure 5(a).

which is shown in Figure 5(b).

• One is the individual discrimination reduction, which is shown

in Figure 6(a).

• One is the individual discrimination reduction minus the accu-

racy loss, which is shown in Figure 6(b).

As shown in Figure 5(a), if we focus on group fairness improve-
ment only, our approach achieves the best performance for 7 out of
10 cases, e.g., e.g., all attributes in Adult Income dataset, all attributes
in German Credit dataset the attribute in Bank dataset. Although
for the neural network trained on Compas dataset, our adaptive
approach does not have the best fairness improvement. If we con-
sider at the same time the accuracy loss, as shown in Figure 5(b),
our approach performs the best in all of the cases. Note that while
the post-processing method RO often improves the group fairness
significantly, the accuracy often drops significantly (e.g., more than
30% after processing with respect to all protected attributes for
the COMPAS dataset, which is clearly unacceptable). In fact, ac-
cording to our experiments, post-processing should rarely be the
choice if we would be maintain high-accuracy.The results shown
in Figure 5(b) clearly suggests that our approach is able to improve
fairness effectively whilst maintaining a high accuracy.

In Figure 6(a), we show the comparison between our approach
and the existing approaches in terms of reducing individual dis-
crimination. We can observe that only the in-processing methods
can reduce the individual discrimination effectively. In fact, our
Adaptive Processing Algorithm 3 almost always selects to apply in-
processing methods, except for Credit-gender and Bank-age. After
applying the in-processing method RW, the CDS remains almost

causality analysis to handle feedback loops. We focus on feed-
forward NN as existing studies on fairness largely focus on tabular
data [15, 21, 34, 40, 49, 50].

Limited fairness metrics We only use SPD and GDS metrics for
group fairness and CDS metric for individual fairness. We focus
on GPD and GDS as they are the primary focuses of existing
works [5, 7, 24, 32, 42, 49]. Given that GPD and GDS are simi-
lar with other metrics which consider positive classification rate
like Disparate Impact, our method could work for other notions of
fairness as well.

Causal effect measurement ACE is commonly used to evaluate
causality [14, 42]. According to [14], alternative measurements like

the same with respect to Credit-gender but worsens by around 2%
with respect to Bank-age. Taking accuracy loss into account at the
same time, we show the individual discrimination reduction minus
the accuracy lost in Figure 6(b). Our approach performs best in 8
out of 10 cases, except for the two cases where RW is selected for
Credit-gender and Bank-age. One potential reason why this is the
case is that existing pre-processing methods are not designed for
reducing individual discrimination and as a result, even if a small
number of input attributes are indeed responsible for the unfair-
ness, existing pre-processing methods such as RW are not able to
remove biases in the training set effectively. This calls for research
into alternative pre-processing methods for reducing individual
discrimination.

It is worth noting that with our approach, we always (10 out
10) achieve improved group fairness and almost always (9 out 10)
achieve reduced individual discrimination, whist achieving a low
accuracy loss.

RQ3: What are the time overhead for causality analysis? The time
spent on causality analysis is summarised in Table 6. Note that the
time is the additional time a user has to spend on applying our
method before applying the selected fairness improving method.
The time required for causality analysis is always less than 10
minutes.

6 THREATS TO VALIDITY
Limited model structures We currently support feed-forward neu-
ral networks (for tabular data) and convolutional neural networks
(for images). It is possible to extend our method to support deep
learning architectures such as RNN (for text data) by extending

generated explanations to understand fairness in machine learning
systems.

Distributional shift in the data Our approach might be affected
by distributional shifts in the data. We evaluate the stability of
our approach against slight distributional shifts on Adult Income
dataset. Firstly, following [20], we randomly split train/test set
10 times and then evaluate whther the method selected by our
approach is the best one for each of the 10 test sets. Secondly,
following [44], we evaluate our approach using data generated by
perturbation. In both conditions, the results confirm that is the
case. It shows perhaps that our approach is robust to such levels of
distributional shift.

7 RELATED WORK
This work is related to research on fairness improving methods,
fairness testing and fairness verification methods as well as broadly
various studies on fairness. Besides those mentioned in the previous
sections, we summarize other related works below.

Fairness Testing and Verification Some existing works attempted
to test model discrimination with fairness score measurements.
In [43], Tramer et al. propose an unwarranted associations frame-
work to detect unfair, discriminatory or offensive user treatment in
data-driven applications. It identifies discrimination according to
multiple metrics including the CV score, related ratio and associa-
tions between outputs and protected attributes. In [33], Kleinberg
et al. also test multiple discrimination scores and compare differ-
ent fairness metrics. In [21], Galhotra et al. propose a tool called
THEMIS to measure software discrimination. It tests discrimination
with two fairness definitions, i.e., group discrimination score and
causal discrimination score. It measures these two scores for differ-
ent software instances with respect to race and gender separately.
Their approach generates additional testing samples by selecting
random values from the domain for all attributes. In [2], Adebayo
et al. try to determine the relative significance of a model’s inputs
in determining the outcomes and use it to assess the discriminatory
extent of the model. In [22], Ghosh et al. verify different fairness
measures of the learning process with respect to underlying data
distribution.

Empirical Studies of Fairness Chakraborty et al. empirically research
on the effectiveness and efficiency of existing fairness improvement
methods based on group fairness metrics [13]. Friedler et al. work
on an empirical study to compare the effects of different fairness im-
provement methods [20]. In [8], Biswas et al. focus on an empirical
evaluation of fairness and mitigation on 8 different real-world ma-
chine learning models. They apply 7 mitigation techniques to these
models and analyzed the fairness, mitigation results, and impacts
on performance. They also present different trade-off choices of
fairness mitigation decisions. Zhang et al. discuss how key aspects
of machine learning systems, such as attribute set and training data,
affect fairness in [49]. Kearns et al. test the effectiveness and mea-
sure the trade-offs between rich subgroup fairness and accuracy
in [32]. In [16], Dodge et al. propose four types of programmatically

8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we empirically evaluate 9 fairness improving meth-
ods on 4 real world dataset and 90 model-attribute combinations
with 3 different fairness metric. Our evaluation shows that existing
fairness improving methods are not always effective in improving
group fairness and are often not effective in reducing individual
discrimination. Meanwhile, we test the trade-off between fairness
improvement and accuracy cost. Motivated by the empirical study,
we propose a light weight approach to choose the the optimal fair-
ness improving method adaptively based on causality analysis. That
is, we identify on the distribution of “responsible” attribute and neu-
rons and choose the methods accordingly. Our evaluation shows
that our approach is effective in choosing the optimal improvement
method.
