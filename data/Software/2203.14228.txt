Neutron captures and delayed decays of reaction products are common sources of backgrounds
in ultra-rare event searches. In this work, we studied 13C(α, n)16O reactions induced by α-particles
emitted within the calibration sources of the Majorana Demonstrator. These sources are
thorium-based calibration standards enclosed in carbon-rich materials. The reaction rate was esti-
mated by using the 6129-keV γ-rays emitted from the excited 16O states that are populated when
the incoming α-particles exceed the reaction Q-value. Thanks to the excellent energy performance
of the Demonstrator’s germanium detectors, these characteristic photons can be clearly observed
in the calibration data. Facilitated by Geant4 simulations, a comparison between the observed
6129-keV photon rates and predictions by a TALYS-based software was performed. The measure-
ments and predictions were found to be consistent, albeit with large statistical uncertainties. This
agreement provides support for background projections from (α, n)-reactions in future double-beta
decay search eﬀorts.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Neutron-related reactions are an important source of
background in underground neutrino and dark matter ex-
periments [1–4]. One common source of neutrons is (α, n)
reactions. Neutrons may penetrate shielding layers be-
fore being captured on sensitive detector materials, often
creating radioactive isotopes, the delayed decays of which

could be diﬃcult to reject due to a lack of coincidence
timing information. For example, in germanium-based
neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ) experiments, neu-
tron captures on 76Ge create 77Ge (half-life: 11.3 hr)
and 77mGe (half-life: 53.7 s) isotopes. The β-decay of
these isotopes could potentially produce signals similar
to 0νββ and with energies near the double-beta decay
Q-value (Qββ) of 76Ge. This background has been stud-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ied in detail [5, 6].

232Th and 238U decay chains contain several α-
emitters. These naturally-occurring isotopes are present
in detector materials, and various α-particles with ener-
gies up to 9 MeV are emitted, initiating a range of (α, n)
reactions. Even though the cleanest materials can be
assayed and selected [7], stringent background require-
ments, especially for future experiments, demand an un-
derstanding of these neutron contributions with reason-
able detail and precision. In particular, diﬀerent types
of plastic materials are widely used in low-background
for electrical insulation and neutron
experiments, e.g.
shielding.
In these carbon-rich plastic materials, the
13C(α, n)16O reaction is a major source of neutrons.

Besides its role as a background, the 13C(α, n)16O reac-
tion is considered the most important neutron source for
s-process nucleosynthesis in low-mass asymptotic giant
branch stars [8–12]. This reaction and its cross section
have been studied, and the results agree reasonably well
among diﬀerent measurements for low-energy α-particles
below about 5 MeV [13–19]. At higher α energies, precise
cross section measurements are sparse [18, 20], although
new studies have been published for the 5-to-6 MeV re-
gion [4] and more measurements are planned in the near
future [19].

In addition to relying on measured data, one can ob-
tain (α, n) cross sections from a statistical modeling ap-
proach using a nuclear reaction code such as TALYS [21].
The TALYS-generated Evaluated Nuclear Data Libraries
(TENDL) merges the TALYS nuclear model with data
available in the JENDL [22] and ENDF [23] databases.
In the case of 13C(α, n)16O, TALYS can predict par-
tial cross sections of diﬀerent reaction channels noted
as 13C(α, nj)16O, where j identiﬁes neutrons associated
with diﬀerent states of 16O. The TALYS-generated cross
sections as a function of α-particle energy are shown in
Fig. 1. Although such a statistical model can be impre-
cise when predicting the detailed resonance structure as
pointed out by Ref. [4], its overall agreement can be used
to approximate the reaction rate, allowing neutron back-
ground predictions for low-background experiments. It is
reasonable to use this approach especially when precise
measurements are sparse over the entire range of α en-
ergies relevant for (α, n) backgrounds, which is typically
broad.

In this paper, we report an analysis of several years
of calibration data taken by the Majorana Demon-
strator experiment, which resulted in a measurement
of characteristic 6129-keV photons emitted following the
13C(α, n2)16O reactions, where the second excited state
(3−) of 16O is populated. We compare the measurement
with a prediction from NeuCBOT (Neutron Calculator
Based On TALYS) [25, 26]. Section II of this paper dis-
cusses the (α, n) reactions within the calibration sources
of the Demonstrator. Section III introduces the ex-
perimental techniques and analysis used to identify the
6129-keV photons. Section IV describes how the TALYS-
based NeuCBOT and a Geant4-based software for the

the 13C(α, n)16O reactions as a function of incident α-particle

sections are generated by TALYS-1.95. The results of the new
TALYS version are consistent with branching ratios obtained
from Ref. [24] that used TALYS-1.8.

Demonstrator are used to predict the number of ob-
servable events. Section V discusses how the same pro-
cedure can be used to estimate the background contribu-
tion to 0νββ measurements. The last section shows how
similar techniques could play an essential role in future
experiments with more stringent background goals.

13C(α, n)16O REACTIONS IN CALIBRATION

In March 2021,

The Majorana Demonstrator

experiment
searched for 0νββ in 76Ge using P-type Point Contact
(PPC) High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors [27].
The Demonstrator was operated at the 4850-foot
level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility
in Lead, South Dakota, with two modules of HPGe
detectors placed in an ultra-clean and heavily shielded
environment as shown in Fig 2. The HPGe detectors
had a combined total mass of 44.1 kg, of which 29.7
kg was enriched to 88% in 76Ge with the rest being
the Demonstrator
natural Ge.
completed its data-taking campaign with enriched
detectors and it continues taking data with natural
detectors for background studies and other physics.
The Demonstrator’s HPGe detectors in combination
with low-noise electronics have achieved good linearity
over a broad energy range [28] and best-in-ﬁeld energy
resolution with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)
approaching 0.1% at the 2039 keV Qββ of 76Ge [29].
This excellent energy performance coupled with the low
energy threshold and low-background of the Demon-
strator makes it a competitive 0νββ experiment and
allows for other physics beyond the Standard Model
[30–34].

Ultra radiopure materials were used in the construc-

eral α-emitters along the way. Table I shows the ener-
gies of the main α-particles, which lie between 5.34 MeV
and 8.79 MeV. When traversing the epoxy in the calibra-
tion source, an α-particle could initiate (α, n) reactions
in 13C, 17O, 18O, 35Cl, and 37Cl, of which reactions with
13C dominate. 13C(α, n2)16O reactions are possible with
α-particles above about 5 MeV, resulting in 6129-keV
photons. The Demonstrator’s excellent energy per-
formance allowed a clear observation of this 6129-keV
signature on top of the thorium photon energy spectrum
during calibrations.

In 13C(α, n)16O reactions, an α-particle is captured in
13C to form the compound nucleus 17O∗, which decays
to the ground state or excited states of 16O by emitting
a neutron. Figure 4 shows the simpliﬁed level scheme of
16O that can be populated from the decay of 17O∗. Since
the α-particles in the thorium chain have energy up to
8.79 MeV as listed in Table I, they can potentially open
up the reactions channels of (α, n1), (α, n2), (α, n3), and
(α, n4). The population of the second excited state (3−)
of 16O at 6129 keV is favored for α-particles with energy
above 6 MeV, as shown by the turquoise line in Fig. 1.
The isomeric transition of the (3−) state to the ground
state of 16O emits a characteristic 6129-keV photon, pre-
senting a unique signature to look for in calibration data.
The 13C(α, n2)16O reaction is described in Eq. 1.

tion of the Demonstrator, particularly in the vicinity
of germanium detectors, which are placed inside layers of
compact shielding [35]. A weekly calibration is required
to monitor detector stability and provide data for de-
veloping analysis cuts. The thorium isotope 228Th was
selected as the calibration source because its decay chain
emits several γ-rays that span from a few hundred keV
up to 2615 keV, covering the Qββ of 76Ge and allow-
ing for analysis over a wide energy range. The Demon-
strator’s calibration line sources were manufactured by
Eckert & Ziegler Analytics, Inc 1. Each line source is
made of thoriated epoxy encapsulated in a tube made
of PTFE [36]. During calibrations, the line source was
deployed into the calibration track, which surrounds the
cryostat in a helical path [36], as shown in Fig 3.

strings within, and the calibration track (highlighted) through
which a line source is deployed during calibrations.

The γ-rays emitted within the thorium decay chain are

decay chain ends when it reaches 208Pb producing sev-

state deexcites through γ-ray emission. Data from [4, 24].

quality checks, validation of the Geant4 simulation, and
the signature search at higher energies. The Majo-
rana Demonstrator Data Acquisition (DAQ) system
records waveforms from each HPGe detector using two
digitization channels with diﬀerent ampliﬁcations, called
the low-gain and high-gain channels. The high-gain chan-
nels have been extensively used for double-beta decay
searches [29], but they saturate around 3 MeV due to the
digitization range. The low-gain channels have a wider
dynamic range up to 10 MeV and allow a study of signa-
tures with higher energy depositions, e.g. by cosmic ray
reactions or neutrons. The low-gain channels are used
here to search for the 6129-keV photons.

A. Data quality and simulation benchmarking

The modular approach of the Demonstrator en-
abled a ﬂexible construction as well as early data-taking
once the ﬁrst module was constructed. Each calibration
source was deployed separately for most of the Demon-
strator’s calibration data, except for a period after the
installation of the second module when two sources were
deployed simultaneously to calibrate both modules. For
these calibrations, the DAQ throughput was potentially
saturated. Thus this analysis only uses data collected
when one calibration source was deployed at a time. Due
to evolving calibration procedures, early commissioning
data are not used. For example, during commissioning,
transition runs during which the source was in motion
were not ﬂagged, which created larger uncertainties in
analysis time boundaries. The data analyzed here include
calibration data sets from the years 2016-2019, which
were also used in the analysis of the recent double-beta
decay results [29]. The data quality checks and channel
selection used in the double-beta decay analysis [29] were
also applied here. Additional data quality checks based
on the prominent 2615-keV γ-peak following the β− de-
cay of 208Tl are applied to the calibration data used in
this analysis. If the 2615-keV, full energy event rate in a

4

run is found to deviate more than 3.5 σ from the mean
rate in the same data set, the run is excluded from this
analysis. Such deviations can occur when, for example,
the nitrogen dewars were ﬁlled, since the ﬂow of liquid
nitrogen induced noise.

After the data quality checks, we compared the ob-
served source activity (Aobserved) with the expected ac-
tivity (Aexpected), deﬁned as:

Aobserved =

R
(cid:15) × b

Aexpected = A0e[−λ(t−t0)]

(2)

(3)

In Eq. 2, the observed activity of a calibration source dur-
ing each weekly calibration was estimated based on the
rate, R, of the full energy 2615 keV peak, the correspond-
ing eﬃciency, (cid:15), of detecting the full energy 2615-keV
photons, and the branching ratio, b, for the 212Bi→208Tl
transition in the 228Th decay chain. The Geant4-based
[37] simulation package, MaGe [38], was used to esti-
mate the detection eﬃciency ((cid:15)) of the 2615-keV photons
originating from the calibration sources in their deployed
positions. In Eq. 3, the expected activity of each calibra-
tion source is projected for every weekly calibration based
on the initial activity, A0, reported by the vendor at a
given time t0, the decay constant, λ, and the time of each
calibration, t. The decay chain is in equilibrium, so the
decay constant is based on the 1.9-year half-life of 228Th.
Uncertainties in the branching ratio, decay constant, and
calibration time are negligible, so the uncertainty in the
expected activity is dominated by the uncertainty in A0,
which was 10.36 ± 0.60 kBq on May 1, 2013.

As shown in Fig. 5, a good agreement was found be-
tween the expected and the observed activity over mul-
tiple years of calibration data for both source assem-
blies. This implies good accuracy for the simulations
performed by MaGe and gives conﬁdence that MaGe
can make correct eﬃciency predictions for the analysis of
the 6129 keV γ-rays.

B. Signature search

The search for

the 6129-keV photons

from the
13C(α, n2)16O reactions was performed using the sum en-
ergy of events, which is obtained by summing all coinci-
dent energy depositions over all active HPGe detectors
within a 4 µs window [30]. This sum energy is used be-
cause of the high probability for several-MeV photons to
distribute their full energy in multiple detectors. Fig. 6
shows the sum energy spectrum above 1 MeV in cali-
bration data. The signature at 6129 keV following the
13C(α, n2)16O reaction is clearly visible. Fig. 7 provides
a spectrum in a smaller energy band around the 6129 keV
region. Events above 2615 keV are mostly due to sum-
ming, or random coincidences of two unrelated decays

5

FIG. 6. The sum energy spectrum of calibration data se-
lected for the analysis. It shows various γ-ray peaks, including
2615 keV, the signature peak of 6129 keV, and other peaks
from the calibration source and peaks due to random coinci-
dence events, and summing.

FIG. 5. Observed and expected activities for the two source
assemblies used in Majorana Demonstrator. The data
points indicate the observed activity of each source assem-
bly for each weekly calibration, while the band represents the
expected activity which includes the vendor reported uncer-
tainty. The uncertainties in the observed activity are statis-
tical only.

in the calibration source. For the latter one, the most
prominent feature is the 5229-keV peak. When two 2615-
keV photons, the energy of which is 2614.511 keV, are in
coincidence, the sum energy appears to be twice of a pho-
ton energy. The zoomed-in plot of this peak is shown in
Fig. 8.

We deﬁned the region of interest (ROI) for the 6129-
keV peak search as (6129 ± 10) keV based on the ex-
pected resolution in that energy region: about 2 keV
(1σ) at 6 MeV, so the chosen window covers about 5σ on
each side of the peak. A simple Gaussian ﬁt to the signal
peak found the mean to be 6127±0.6 keV and the stan-
dard deviation to be 1.8±0.4 keV, as shown in Fig. 7. A
total of 9 events were found in the ROI in all data com-
bined. Given the low statistics, the uncertainties from
the ﬁt are relatively large and less robust. As a cross-
check, a simple Gaussian plus a ﬂat background was ﬁt
to the much stronger double coincidence 5229-keV peak
in Fig. 8, where the mean was found to be 5228±0.2 keV
with a standard deviation of 2.0±0.1 keV. These full en-

ergy peaks are seen at their expected locations and with
their expected widths in the sum energy spectrum from
the low-gain channels, indicating a great energy perfor-
mance extended to the energy range of multiple-MeV.

As seen in Fig. 7, the signature peak at 6129 keV stands
out clearly, so all of the 9 observed events in the peak are
considered to be the signal, i.e. 6129-keV photons fol-
lowing the 13C(α, n2)16O reactions. Given that no back-
ground events were found for at least 20 keV on both
sides of the peak outside the ROI, the potential back-
ground in the 40-keV region from 6099 keV to 6159 keV
excluding the 20-keV ROI can be determined as at most
1.29 counts at a 1σ level, which translates to a 1σ upper
limit of 0.64 counts of background in the ROI. To bet-

Here, Y is the γ-ray production yield per decay of tho-
rium, which is constant for all data sets since the source
assembly does not change. For each weekly calibration i,
the factors Ai, (cid:15)i, and Ti are the source activity, detec-
tion eﬃciency for the 6129-keV photons, and live time, re-
spectively. The eﬃciency, (cid:15)i, was calculated with MaGe
for the 6129-keV photon using the same geometry as for
the 2615-keV analysis, but the sum energy was used in-
stead of individual detector energy for consistency. The
simulated 6129-keV peak shape in the sum energy spec-
trum for 6129-keV photons uniformly seeded inside the
calibration source is shown in Fig. 7. The same ROI as
in the data analysis was used to calculate the eﬃciency.
Realistic energy responses, including dead layer models
of each detector [29], are folded into the simulation, so
the peak has slight deviations from Gaussian, notably a
low energy tail.

B. Comparison of observed and expected events

Table II compares the expected number of 6129-keV
γ-rays with the number observed; the latter can be mod-
elled by Poisson statistics with an unknown true mean.
Based on the observed signal counts, the conﬁdence in-
terval on the mean of Poisson signals is calculated at a
90% conﬁdence level (C.L.) using the Feldman-Cousins
statistical approach for small signals [41].

Sources of uncertainty in the expected counts are sum-
marized in Table III. Uncertainties in the SRIM database
are reported in Ref. [42]. Uncertainties due to the chem-
ical composition of the epoxy material and in the source
activities were both based on the speciﬁcations provided
by the vendor. As discussed before, the projected back-
ground contribution in the ROI depends on the choice of
background regions and the diﬀerence between the nar-
row 40-keV and the wide 480-keV background regions is
taken as the uncertainty. To assess uncertainty associ-
ated with the calculation of the high energy photon de-
tection eﬃciency using the sum energy, we repeated the
calibration source activity analysis in Section III using
the sum energy. On average, a 11.9% diﬀerence in the
source activity is observed between calculations based on
single detector energy and the sum energy at 2615-keV.
The diﬀerence between the vendor speciﬁcation and the
source activity based on the sum energy was found to be
smaller, so the 11.9% is an overestimation of the system-
atic uncertainty in simulation.

Figure 9 visualizes the comparison between the ex-
pected and the observed number of 6129-keV photons.
The observed number of events tends to be higher than
the expected number, however the statistical uncertainty
in the experimental data is large. The range of expected

also counted events in a much broader background region

counts in the ROI. Incidentally, this projects 0.67 counts
of background from 6099 keV to 6159 keV excluding the
20-keV ROI, statistically consistent with observing none,
which would happen with a 50% probability. In short,
the observed number of signal events in the ROI in the
combined data sets is 9, while 0.33 counts is the esti-
mated background contribution to the expected number
of events. The diﬀerence between 0.33 counts and 0.64
counts is treated as a systematic uncertainty on the back-
ground contribution to the ROI.

IV. COMPARISONS WITH PREDICTIONS

A. Prediction calculation

NeuCBOT [25] is a software tool based on TALYS to
calculate the neutron yield and neutron energy spectra
for (α, n) reactions in materials. It models the entire tra-
jectory of α-particles: initializing α-particles according to
ENSDF evaluated nuclear decay data [39], tracking their
energy loss and range according to SRIM [40], and ulti-
mately predicting the (α, n) rate based on cross sections
in TALYS-based TENDL. In this work, the 6129-keV
photon production rate was estimated by NeuCBOT us-
ing the partial 13C(α, n2)16O cross sections from TALYS-
1.95, and it was found to be 2.98 ×10−7 γ/Th-decay.

The detector conﬁguration, such as the list of active
detectors, can vary over time. The source activity also
reduces as thorium decays away. Therefore, the number
of predicted events was calculated for each weekly cali-

corresponding uncertainties are the combination of various uncertainties shown in Table III. The range of signal mean is the
90% C.L. interval of Poisson signal mean based on observed signal counts in each data [41]. The individual data set labeling
follows Demonstrator conﬁguration changes as explained in Ref. [29].

counts is overall consistent with the 90% conﬁdence in-
terval on the observed signal strength. This comparison
suggests that TALYS cross sections combined with SRIM
enables reasonable estimations of (α, n) rates. This con-
sistency at a 90% conﬁdence level lends support to the ap-
proach of predicting neutron production from α-induced
reactions in low-background experiments using the pre-
sented tools.

V. BACKGROUND ESTIMATION FOR 0νββ
SEARCH

Neutrons produced by (α, n) reactions during the
Demonstrator’s calibration runs can enter the germa-
nium crystals and get captured. After each calibration,
these sources were retracted to parked locations entirely
outside the shield. Therefore, only the neutrons pro-
duced during the calibration are of concern. When 76Ge
undergoes neutron capture, the ground state of 77Ge or
the metastable state, 77mGe, can be produced, both of
which could β decay with energy releases larger than the
2039 keV Qββ of 0νββ in germanium [6]. The main back-
ground contributor here is the long-lived isotope 77Ge
with a half-life of 11.2 hr, which can decay during the
0νββ decay data-taking periods following the hours-long
calibration periods. The metastable state 77mGe with a
54-second half-life is less of a concern.

Fig. 10 shows the NeuCBOT calculation of energies
and yields of neutrons generated from all types of (α, n)
reactions within the calibration sources. MaGe was used
to estimate the production and decay of 77Ge inside the
germanium crystals given this neutron ﬂux. This back-
ground contribution was estimated to be on the order of
10−5 cts/(keV-kg-year) before any analysis cuts. This
shows that calibration neutrons are a negligible contri-
bution compared with the total background measured in
the Demonstrator [29].

The GERDA experiment investigated a similar back-
ground source in their Phase I data taking [43]. They
estimated a background contribution of 10−4 cts/(keV-
kg-year) for 0νββ by neutrons from calibration sources.

tent with simulations over various detector conﬁgurations
in multiple years of calibrations. The agreement between
the expected decay activity and the observed activity of
the calibration sources in the Majorana Demonstra-
tor is reported for the ﬁrst time, demonstrating the ex-
cellent performance of the MaGe simulation software,
which is also used by GERDA and LEGEND.

Our work shows how signatures of (α, n) reactions
can be detected in low-background experiments and how
simulations are crucial in understanding this radiogenic
neutron background. The agreement between simulated
and measured rate is valuable feedback since (α, n) data
can be sparse, and can have signiﬁcant discrepancies, as
pointed out by Ref. [4]. At 90% C.L., our measurement
of the 6129-keV photons from the second excited state in
16O is consistent with the predictions generated by the
TALYS-based NeuCBOT program, although the statisti-
cal uncertainty is large. This suggests that the TALYS-
based NeuCBOT provides a reasonable estimation of
neutrons from thorium impurities in carbon-rich organic
materials. Our ﬁndings are widely applicable, as thorium
is one of the most common impurities, and carbon-rich
organic materials such as various plastics and epoxies are
often used in experiments in abundance. It is reasonable
to expect that (α, n) reactions induced by alpha parti-
cles from thorium impurities in a range of carbon-rich
organic materials share similar proﬁles. While future ex-
periments may utilize materials with higher radiopurity
than the current experiments, the size and length of fu-
ture experiments can result in a similar (α, n) background
contribution for these rare event searches.

FIG. 10. Neutron energy spectrum from the (α, n) reactions
in the epoxy. The spectrum is obtained by using NeuCBOT
based on TALYS-1.95 generated cross sections data.

The higher background index can be explained by the
stronger activity and slightly diﬀerent geometry used in
GERDA. For GERDA Phase II data taking, this back-
ground was minimized by deploying a new design of gold-
encapsulated thorium calibration source [43]. This design
reduces the possible interaction of α-particles and it is
adapted by the LEGEND calibration system [44].

Next-generation experiments searching for 0νββ have
much more stringent background requirements. Hence,
potential background sources of radiogenic (α, n) neu-
trons from detector construction materials should be ex-
amined carefully. While extensive eﬀorts are in place
to shield room and cosmogenic neutrons, some neutron
sources could be inside the water shielding or are even in-
troduced by shielding materials [6]. One example is the
large steel cryostat which houses the LEGEND main ar-
gon volume. The combination of TALYS-based software
can be valuable to provide rough estimations in these
cases, as investigated in Refs. [44, 45], using NeuCBOT
in combination with Geant4.

VI. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

The work presented above combines the achievements
of the Majorana Demonstrator experiment in terms
of excellent energy performance and robust as-built simu-
lations. The search for signatures in a wide energy range,
well beyond the Qββ of 76Ge, is possible due to excel-
lent energy linearity and resolution of the Majorana
Demonstrator. These achievements result from the
intrinsic advantages of HPGe detectors in combination
with low-noise electronics and dedicated eﬀorts on energy
estimation corrections and calibrations. The analysis
presented here found a good agreement between detected
and expected energy for the signature at 6129 keV and
veriﬁed the algorithms at the sum peak of two 2615-keV
γ-rays. We have shown that the measured rate is consis-
