Abstract 
The second quantum revolution has been producing groundbreaking scientific and technological outputs 
since the early 2000s; however, the scientific literature on the impact of this revolution on the industry, 
specifically on start-ups, is limited. In this paper, we present a landscaping study with a gathered dataset of 
441 companies from 42 countries that we identify as quantum start-ups, meaning that they mainly focus on 
quantum technologies (QT) as their primary priority business. We answer the following questions: (1) What 
are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups? (2) How can we categorize them, 
and how are these categories populated? (3) Are there any patterns that we can derive from empirical data 
on trends? We found that more than 92% of these companies have been founded within the last 10 years, 
and more than 50% of them are located in the US, the UK, and Canada. We categorized the QT start-ups 
into  six  fields:  (i)  complementary  technologies,  (ii)  quantum  computing  (hardware),  (iii)  quantum 
computing  (software/application/simulation),  (iv)  quantum  cryptography/communication,  (v)  quantum 
sensing and metrology, and (vi) supporting companies, and analyzed the population of each field both for 
countries, and temporally. Finally, we argue that low levels of quantum start-up activity in a country might 
be an indicator of a national initiative to be adopted afterwards, which later sees both an increase in the 
number of start-ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields.

Introduction 
For over the last two decades, the second quantum revolution [1] has been ongoing with increasing global 
interest. Since the early 2010s, many of the large economies such as the UK [2], the US [3], France [4], 
Germany [5], Russia [6], India [7], and China [8] initiated national programs to support the development 
of quantum technologies (QT). In addition to the national programs, regional initiatives such as the EU 
Quantum  Flagship  [9],  and  international  collaboration  within  greater  contexts,  such  as  the  promise  of 
increased collaboration on QT under AUKUS [10], have been happening in the last few years. These are 
being accompanied by a sharp increase in both the number of academic publications [11], the number of 
patents granted [12], and overall investments [13], which have led to an increased amount of private funding 
in a period some refer to as the ‘quantum gold rush’ [14]. The expected public investment to QT within the 
next five to ten years is more than 20 billion euros [15]. In just a decade, QT became a contender for being 
the ‘next big thing’ from a topic discussed mainly in physics conferences. 

All these activities are also accompanied by an increase in the number of start-ups being founded, and an 
ecosystem rapidly growing. Some aspects of the QT ecosystem in general have been studied in the literature, 
such as the skills and knowledge needed for the required new workforce [16], and the temporal consultancy 
work within the growing QT market [17]. Furthermore, there are many studies focusing on applications of 
QT  and  its  subfields,  such  as  industry  [18]  and  commercial  [19]  applications  of  quantum  computing, 
quantum computing for finance [20,21], chemistry [22], and so on. Similarly, there are many studies on 
sectoral applications of QT like for space [23], telecommunications [24], and military [25]. However, a 
study on the emerging landscape of the quantum start-up ecosystem has been missing in the literature. 

In this paper, we aim to answer several essential questions regarding the evolution and properties of this 
emerging landscape:  

(1) What are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups?  
(2)  How  can  quantum  start-ups  be  categorized,  and  how  are  these  categories  populated? 
(3) What type of patterns can be derived from empirical data on trends?  

Methods 
In this section, we provide information on how the dataset of quantum start-up companies were compiled, 
how they were categorized under six subfields, and the limitations of our methods. 

Dataset 
The dataset utilized in this study was created between September 2017 and September 2022 with gradual 
additions.  We  mainly  used  publicly  available  resources  such  as  websites,  LinkedIn  profiles,  targeted 
Crunchbase  searches  [26],  and  other  databases.  There  were  several  ordered  lists  of  companies  that  we 
utilized as resources, such as the lists in at Understanding Quantum Technologies document by Olivier 
Ezratty [27], the Private/Startup Companies section of the Quantum Computing Report website [28], The 
Quantum Insider platform [29], QIS Data Portal [30], and several consortium member lists such as Quantum 
Industry Canada (QIC) [31], The Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) [32], European 
Quantum  Industry  Consortium  (QuIC)  [33],  UKQuantum  [34],  Quantum  Technologies  Development 
Consortium  (QTC)  in  Israel  [35],  Quantum  Technology  and  Application  Consortium  (QUTAC)  in 
Germany [36], MSU Quantum Technology Centre in Russia [37], Quantum Business Network in Germany 
[38], and IBM Quantum Network [39]. Furthermore, in years we added start-ups to our database from the 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
participant lists of events like Inside Quantum Technology [40], Quantum Business Europe [41], Q2B [42] 
organized by QCWare, and Careers in Quantum Technologies organized by QURECA [43]. 

First of all, we wanted to correctly depict the evolution of the dedicated quantum start-up ecosystem; hence, 
we aimed at excluding all companies that only approached QT as a secondary business or focused on it 
only later in their company history. Our aim was to minimize the number of false positives in our database. 
It was easy to identify and exclude major corporate players such as IBM and Google. It was also easy to 
identify  many  of  the  start-up  companies  that  were  operating  in  adjacent  fields,  such  as  photonics, 
nanotechnology or cybersecurity, and getting into the quantum field. There were some borderline cases, 
start-up companies that started in an adjacent field but transitioned to prioritizing QT in recent years. To 
identify these, we used the WayBackMachine provided by the non-profit Internet Archive [44] to check 
previous  versions  of  the  company  websites,  and  look  for  explicit  references  to  QT  or  closely  related 
products (like single photon sources-detectors, cryogenic systems, quantum dots, etc.). 

Secondly,  we  wanted  to  identify  the  countries  and  founding  years  of  these  start-ups  as  accurately  as 
possible.  This  especially  became  a  priority  after  encountering  numerous  contradicting  information  on 
publicly available databases. Therefore, we adopted the following double-check mechanisms: (i) checking 
when the website was founded via WayBackMachine, (ii) checking LinkedIn profiles of one or several 
founders, (iii) checking news articles (especially useful for university spin-offs), and (iv) checking seed or 
series A funding news if there are supporting venture capital firms. Sometimes more informal methods, 
such as asking an employee or a founder the founding date of the company, were also employed. 

Thirdly, for the country of the start-ups, if the company moved after its founding, we considered the original 
country as the ‘Country’ of our start-up. This was a deliberate choice to avoid any bias that might be carried 
on  by  the  date data  gathering  was  stopped.  Also,  we believe that  a  company's origin  country  has more 
explanatory value in identifying the global distribution of expertise and interest, and a company’s operating 
country has more explanatory value in depicting the current market maturity levels. Researchers interested 
in market activity are welcome to utilize and alter our dataset with a quick check on each start-up. 

Finally, during this paper we refer to all the new companies that were founded with a particular focus in the 
QT as quantum start-ups, regardless of their age. This is due to our analysis mainly focusing on the founding 
of  these  companies,  rather  than  their  performance,  longevity,  or  other  qualities.  For  the  dataset,  we 
acknowledge that there are some companies that shut down their operations, and others that were acquired 
by larger companies, and a few that went through mergers. We did not incorporate this information into our 
dataset, again for the same reason above. Formation of a start-up is an indicator of at least some expertise 
and interest in that country. Similarly, shutting down operations, acquisitions, and mergers are markers for 
different types of market activities, and although these might bear insightful fruits for innovation studies 
purposes, they are beyond the scope of our study.  

Encoding 
After compiling the dataset, we went through the process of assigning a main field of operation to each 
start-up.  Following  the  US  framework  [3]  we  divided  QT  into  three  main  subfields  quantum 
computing/simulation, quantum cryptography/communication, and quantum sensing and metrology. After 
this, due to the levels of high activity in quantum computing, we divided it into two subfields of quantum 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
computing (hardware) and quantum computing (software/application/simulation). Additionally, we added 
two more fields to cover companies that could not be listed under these previously mentioned four fields, 
and  those  were  complementary  technologies,  and  supporting  companies.  So,  in  the  end,  we  had  the 
following six fields: (i) complementary technologies (sometimes also referred to as enabling technologies), 
(ii)  quantum  computing  (hardware),  (iii)  quantum  computing  (software/application/simulation),  (iv) 
quantum  cryptography/communication,  (v)  quantum  sensing  and  metrology,  and  (vi)  supporting 
companies. 

Complementary  technologies  cover  start-ups  developing  cryogenic  systems,  control  electronics,  vapor 
cells,  and  similar  products  that  particularly  aim  to  enable  QT  devices.  Quantum  computing  hardware 
companies  are  those  that  focus  on  developing  the  hardware  of  quantum  computers  (usually  qubit 
technologies) relying on different types of physical systems such as ion traps, superconducting systems, 
photonics,  silicon,  diamonds,  and  others.  Quantum  computing  software/application/simulation  field 
includes companies from those developing sector-specific applications (like finance) to companies working 
on  quantum  software  development  (such  as  compilers).  For  the  quantum  cryptography/communication 
field,  we  decided  to  include  dedicated  post-quantum cryptography  (PQC)  companies, in addition to  the 
expected  quantum  key  distribution  (QKD),  quantum  encryption,  and  quantum  network  companies.  The 
quantum sensing and metrology field includes both types of companies that are developing quantum sensors 
and the ones that utilize quantum sensors for sector specific solutions. Finally, supporting companies are 
start-ups that exist solely for purposes like consulting, education, event organization, and incubators. 

For  visualization,  we  used  ggplot2,  ggforce,  RColorBrewer,  dplyr,  and  forcats  packages  in  the  R 
programming language. We used color blind friendly palettes when possible. 

Limitations 
There  are  three  main  limitations  of  this  study.  First,  although  we  believe  our  dataset  to  be  highly 
representative, we cannot argue that it is exhaustive. There are start-ups with no online activity. This is 
particularly true for non-English speaking countries. Therefore, it should be noted that the database biases 
Western countries, especially the English-speaking ones. Secondly, the exclusion principles upheld here 
can easily be challenged. One might argue that a start-up that now focuses on QT should be accepted as a 
quantum start-up, which is as valid as our claim. We aimed at keeping the false positives near zero, which 
might have yielded an increased number of false negatives, and caused the exclusion of legitimate quantum 
start-ups. Hence, this limitation of arbitrariness in where the line is drawn should also be acknowledged 
while considering our outcomes and analysis. Finally, although here we focused on the number of start-ups 
to  describe  the  landscape  of  the  quantum  start-up  ecosystem,  investment,  valuation  sizes,  and  similar 
parameters can also be included as additional layers of analysis. Therefore, one should keep in mind the 
limitations of this study while assessing its conclusions. 

In the next section, we present the key properties of our dataset and the outcomes of our analyses. 

Results 
Our  dataset  covers  441  companies  in  42  countries  that  mainly  focus  on  QT  as  their  primary  priority 
business.  The  oldest  companies  covered  in  our  dataset  are  D-Wave  Systems  and  MagiQ  Technologies, 
which were founded in 1999. Therefore, the dataset covers 23 years of data between 1999-2022. We did 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
not include corporate divisions (like IBM Quantum or Google Quantum AI Lab) in our dataset, and focused 
on and included companies that were founded as start-ups in QT. 

Figure 1:  Number of new quantum start-ups per year. 

In Fig. 1, the yearly distribution of new start-ups per year is given. In our dataset, it appears that the number 
of  start-ups  founded  has  increased  sharply  starting  from  2013,  peaked  in  2018,  and  has  been  slightly 
declining ever since (Fig. 1). In Fig. 2, the global distributions of these companies are provided. Though it 
might be important to keep in mind that our dataset does not cover stealth start-ups with zero visibility and 
has a lower representation of start-ups from non-English speaking countries. This can also be observed in 
the global distribution of start-ups (Fig. 2), as the majority of companies in the dataset are from the US, 
Canada, and the UK.

Next, we checked the yearly distribution of new start-ups with respect to different fields. In Fig. 3, the violin 
plot shows the temporal distribution of start-ups in fields. The areas inside the curves add up to the total 
number of start-ups in respective fields.  

6 

 
 
 
Figure 3: Violin plot of new quantum start-ups per year in different fields. 

It can be seen from Fig. 3 that almost all fields have experienced a surge of interest in recent years, although 
there has been some activity in the field since the early 2000s. The most uniform temporal distribution can 
be seen in the quantum sensing and metrology field, while the most skewed distribution is for the supporting 
companies. This can also be observed in Fig. 4, where we looked at numbers per year in different fields 
instead of ratios.

Figure 4: Number of new quantum start-ups in their respective fields per year. 

Following this, we checked the global distribution of start-ups in different fields in Fig. 5. It can be seen 
that  the  most  diverse  fields  (where  a  high  number  of  countries  are  active)  are  quantum  computing 
(software/applications/simulation), quantum cryptography/communication, and supporting companies. The 
least  diverse  fields  are  quantum  sensing  and  metrology,  and  complementary  technologies.  Although, 
regardless of diversity, the US leads in the number of start-ups in every field, while the second place varies 
between  fields.  For  example,  Canada  has  the  second  most  start-ups  in  both  quantum  computing  fields 
(hardware and software/applications/simulation), while the UK has the second place in the quantum sensing 
and  metrology,  and  the  quantum  cryptography/communication  fields.  Lastly,  in  the  complementary 
technologies field, Germany and Netherlands are competing for second place.

Afterwards, we checked the global distribution of start-ups in different fields in Fig. 6. For the top five 
countries (the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, and France), it can be seen that each six fields are represented. 
However,  as  we  go  down  the  line,  it  becomes  less  frequent.  We  can  see  that  in  some  countries,  only 
supporting companies exist. Furthermore, there is no apparent pattern across the countries in the ratios of 
start-ups operating in different fields.

Figure 6: Number of quantum start-ups in countries in different fields stacked. 

In Fig. 7 we present the information on which and when fields have been emerging in which countries. It 
can be seen that in the US and the UK, supporting companies have been the emerging trend for the last 
several years, while in other countries, the trends vary widely. This is particularly useful to see in countries 
with a low number of start-ups, which field was introduced when. It can be seen that almost half of the 
countries in the list had their first start-up in quantum technologies following 2015, and the level of activity 
in countries with already one or few start-ups has highly increased since 2015. However, it can be seen that 
in a handful of countries, there has been activity since the mid -2000s, and in the US, there has been almost 
continuous activity since the early 2000s.

Figure 7: Yearly frequency of companies founded for each country to identify emerging interests in fields. 

Following the country based analysis, we clustered the start-ups founded in different regions for a global 
comparison of regions versus countries. This was particularly conducted to compare the EU-27 to the US, 
Australia,  Canada  and  the  UK  (acronymed  as  AU-CA-UK),  and  the  rest  of  the  world  (acronymed  as 
ROTW). Two figures were created for comparison. In Fig. 8, we compare the total number of companies 
founded in these regions, and in Fig. 9, different fields in a stacked graph. 

11 

 
 
 
Figure 8: Total number of quantum start-ups founded in different regions. 

Fig. 8 demonstrates the additional insights that can be gained by comparing regions instead of countries. 
Here, it can be seen that in terms of sheer numbers of companies the US, the EU-27, and the AU-CA-UK 
are operating on similar levels. Meanwhile, the rest of the world does not possess that many start-ups. This 
can be related  to  the limitations  of  our  dataset, the  fact that  start-up  culture is more adopted  by  certain 
regions, some other factors or a combination of these. 

12 

 
 
 
Figure 9: Number of quantum start-ups in regions in different fields stacked. 

Finally, in Fig. 9, we present the type of companies in different regions. It can be seen that the EU-27 has 
more  supporting  companies,  start-ups  focusing  on  complementary/enabling  technologies  and  quantum 
cryptography/communication start-ups, while the US has a strong lead compared to the EU in quantum 
sensing and metrology, and quantum computing hardware start-ups. This figure shows that the adoption of 
different fields of QT varies on regional levels, however, all regions have presence in all the fields of QT. 

Discussion 
There are several quick answers that we can derive from the data presented above to our research questions. 
First of all, the temporal distribution of the quantum start-up ecosystem is not uniform; more than 92% of 
the companies we identified as quantum start-ups have been founded within the last 10 years, 68% in the 
last 5 years. Similarly, for the geographical distribution, more than 50% of the start-ups are located in the 
US, the UK, and Canada. Although there are 42 countries in our dataset, only half of them have more than 
two start-ups. We can say that the phenomenon of the quantum start-up ecosystem is both recent and limited 
in its global adoption. 

Secondly, we categorized the companies under six fields, and investigated how these fields are populated. 
It can be seen in Fig. 3 that the most uniformly populated field is quantum sensing. Furthermore, it can be 
argued that there are established companies that are filling the market gap that might provide the necessary 
incentive for a start-up to be founded. We observed this while gathering data, as several measurement device 
manufacturers adopted QT-oriented products as one of their primary businesses, and we had to go back in 
their  corporate  history  to  identify  whether  they  were  quantum  start-ups  from  the  beginning;  if  not,  we 

13 

 
 
 
 
excluded them from the dataset. In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 it can be seen that all fields were most active in the 
period  after  2016,  which  again  is  not  surprising  since  both  the  EU  Flagship  [9]  and  the  US  National 
Quantum Initiative [3] were kicked off in 2018, signaling that there will be increased market activity and 
funding opportunities in the following years. 

Thirdly, a phenomenon to be observed regarding the categories is the emergence of a field of ‘Supporting 
Companies’. The consultancy aspect of this phenomenon was also addressed previously in the literature for 
quantum computing in a qualitative manner [17}. Here, our data clearly shows the emergence of supporting 
companies  around  the  newly  established  QT  sector.  The  businesses  of  these  companies  are  mainly 
consultancy, ecosystem support/development, reporting, event organization, and education. As the needs 
of the quantum industry [16] diversify, it is only natural that the supporting ecosystem becomes diverse in 
the services they provide to this rapidly growing sector. 

Fourthly, there are two clear patterns from the gathered data that we observed. First, the number of countries 
that contain interested entrepreneurs toward QT has been increasing, especially since 2016. Additionally, 
it appears that low levels of start-up activity usually precede the formulation of national initiatives, and the 
number of start-ups rises after such initiatives are announced. In the light of this observation, it can be 
proposed that for a country to formulate a national initiative, having one or two start-ups in the QT domain 
is usually a precursor or a catalyst. Furthermore, if this can be generalized, we can expect national initiatives 
in  more  than  20  countries  where  start-ups  emerged  following  2016,  and  that  does  not  have  a  national 
initiative focusing on QT. Secondly, 38% of countries possess QT start-ups that are operating in four or 
more fields of QT, indicating a diverse set of activities in QT. This by itself is not an indicator that different 
fields in QT are supporting each other, but remembering from Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 that almost all fields have 
certain levels of globally diverse start-up actors. To summarize this point, low levels of activity might be 
an indicator of a national initiative for a country, which later sees both an increase in the number of start-
ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields. 

Fifthly, it should be noted that not all start-ups are created equal. For example, PsiQuantum, a photonic 
quantum computing hardware manufacturing company, has raised over 600 M$ in its funding rounds [45] 
or IonQ, a publicly-traded ion trap quantum computing hardware manufacturing company, is valued almost 
around 2 B$ [46]. On the other hand, many of the start-ups have much lower seed funds or initial investment 
amounts [47]. 

Sixthly, an open question in the QT ecosystem development predictions is whether there is room for further 
diversification or if the time for consolidation is soon. We recently started seeing mergers in the field, such 
as Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum [48], and Pasqal and Qu&Co [49]. Also, there 
have been partial acquisitions, such as SK Telecom buying out the majority share of ID Quantique [50]. 
There have also been special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deals like IonQ [46], Rigetti [51], and 
D-Wave [52], which attracted hundreds of millions of dollars each, but also potentially created new hurdles 
for the companies such as more public scrutiny and hostile reports by short-sellers [53]. As discussed in the 
literature previously, the quantum gold rush  (14) caused the attraction of private funding to the field in 
many  shapes  and  forms.  However,  the  phenomenon  of  acquisitions,  mergers,  and  SPACs  appear  to  be 
recent, which followed the increased interest in the QT domain following 2016. Additionally, there are new 
mechanisms to support diversification, such as the European Innovation Council (EIC). Previously, EIC 
supported  three  companies  in  the  QT  field  [54]  and  for  2022  there  is  an  open  Pathfinder  Challenge  in 

14 

 
 
“Alternative  approaches  to  Quantum  Information  Processing,  Communication,  and  Sensing”  with  an 
approximately  €28M  [55]  budget.  Therefore,  the  question  of  whether  the  trend  of  diversification  will 
continue at this rate or whether consolidation will become the modus operandi of the field is a question 
directly related to whether further increase in interest from countries and private investment sources are 
possible or not. The idea of a possible quantum winter, especially in quantum computing [56], has been 
discussed  previously.  Our  data  does  not  clearly  provide  any  answers  in  one  way  or  another;  however, 
running  a  similar  analysis  in  two  or  three  years  and  comparing  with  ours  might  allow  further  insight, 
especially on the question of whether 2018 was a true maximum, or that we are just missing data due to the 
limitations listed in the Methods section. 

Seventhly,  we  expect  a  further  expansion  of  categories  will  become  necessary  as  the  field  progresses. 
Within the field of quantum cryptography/communications, there are companies that are engaged in PQC, 
QKD, quantum encryption, and quantum networks. The timelines of these subfields vary, hence, as the 
number of start-ups and market activity increases, this field is probably going to require a division into three 
subfields; PQC, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. A similar argument can also be made 
for the quantum sensing and metrology field, since it encompasses companies operating in increasingly 
separate areas of activity. 

Eightly, it is clear from Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 that regional level analysis offers additional insight on top of the 
country  level  analyses.  However,  reaching  conclusions  from  regional  level  analysis  require  further 
investment into identifying the appropriate regional clusters. In this work, we focused on comparing the 
EU-27 with the US and AU-CA-UK as potential market competitors, but the relationship between these 
regions and the clustered countries deserve a dedicated analysis. Our preliminary findings here reflect that 
there are regional differences in preferences towards certain fields of QT, but there is diversity of companies 
in terms of fields within each region. 

Finally, while gathering data, we noticed the emergence of a new group of organizations within the quantum 
ecosystem, which are non-profit organizations and similar supporting entities. There are several consortia 
of  organizations  mainly  aiming  at  industry  goals;  Quantum  Industry  Canada  (QIC)  [31],  The  Quantum 
Economic Development (QED-C) in the US [32], European Quantum Industry Consortium (QuIC) [33], 
Quantum  Technology  and  Application  Consortium  (QUTAC)  in  Germany  [36],  UKQuantum  [34], 
Quantum Ecosystems Technology Council of India (QETCI) [57], Quantum Technologies Development 
Consortium (QTC) in Israel [35], Quantum Innovation Initiative Consortium (QIIC) in Japan [58], and the 
Consortium  organized  around  the  Lomonosov Moscow  State  University in  Russia  (37).  There  are  non-
profit organizations with education and outreach purposes like QWorld [59], One Quantum [60], Q-munity 
[61], Feynman Foundation [62], and Quantum AI Foundation [63]. There are supporting organizations like 
Unitary Fund [64] and Quantum Open Source Foundation [65]. Finally, there are incubators and similar 
initiatives supported by local governments such as the Munich Quantum Valley [66] in Bavaria/Germany, 
the Quantum Algorithms Institute [67] in British Columbia/Canada, and Chicago Quantum Exchange [68] 
in Illinois/US. We believe that a landscaping study on the ecosystem comprising these organizations is also 
required  as  both  the  number  of  organizations,  and  their  intertwinement  with  the  rest  of  the  ecosystem 
appears to be growing. 

Conclusion 

15 

 
 
 
 
In this paper, we presented the gathered dataset of 441 companies from 42 countries that we identified as 
quantum start-ups, meaning that they were founded as companies mainly focusing on QT as their primary 
priority business. Following this, we answered some questions on temporal and geographical distribution 
of these start-ups, their categories, and patterns emerging from their analysis.  

As a descriptive study, we hope this work can act as a good foundational work for future studies. The dataset 
can be improved by adding further information on companies like their size, valuation, investment amounts, 
and other aspects. Similarly, each field deserves more in-depth analysis of its dynamics, and some questions 
are raised here such as the effects of the emerging cohort of supporting companies, whether the start-up 
activity  can  actually  be  connected  to  following  policy  decisions  (in  the  form  of  national  initiatives  or 
programs), and what are the path-dependencies that are currently being set which will limit the opportunity 
space of future development of the field. Start-ups are considered to be an important aspect of the emerging 
ecosystem of QT [69], and exploring such questions can lead to a better-informed understanding of further 
steps to be taken.
