Abstract.
Small radio telescope in 21cm was used for studying the partial solar
eclipse, with magnitude 0.89, in Hong Kong on 21st June, 2020. The radio telescope
SPIDER 300A was designed and constructed by the Radio2Space Company, Italy. Ra-
dio ﬂux density time curves (light curve) and a two-dimension mapping of the eclipse
is presented in this paper. Standard radio data reduction methods were used to obtain
the intensity time curve. We also adopted the semi-pipeline method for the reduction
of data to obtain the same results as with the built-in software of the radio telescope
SPIDER 300A. The total solar radio ﬂux of the eclipse was found to reduce by maxi-
mum 55 ± 5 percent, while the maximum eclipsed area of the same eclipse is 86.08%.
Other radio observations of solar eclipses in Hong Kong are also discussed in this pa-
per, including SPIDER 300A observation of partial solar eclipse on 26th December
2019 (APPENDIX A); and small radio telescope (SRT), developed by the Haystack
Observatory, MIT, USA, observation of 2020 eclipse (APPENDIX B).

Key words: Solar observations.

1. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst radio solar physics paper was published at 1944 (Reber, 1944). After
that, solar radio physics was born. Following this development, several interest-
ing books with details for introducing in solar radio physics keep momentum in the
ﬁeld (Kundu, 1965; Kruger, 1979; Kundu and Gergely, 1980; McLean and Labrum,
1985).

For solar radio astronomy studies, total or partial eclipses provide great op-
portunities for solar radio observations. Solar radio observation primarily are time-
dependent. Furthermore, several radio solar eclipse observations were carried out
in China in 1958, 1968, 1980 and 1987. And the ﬁndings were brieﬂy introduced
(Liu and Fu, 1998).

On November 3 1994, high spectral and time resolution radio observations of
solar eclipse were carried out at Chapeco, Brazil for the ﬁrst time (Sawant et al.,

Romanian Astron. J. , Vol. 1, No. 1, p. 1–17, Bucharest, 2019

1997), asymmetrical limb brightening at 1.5 GHz was observed and recorded. Be-
sides, thanks to the advance in technology, sensitivity for the backend system had
improved a lot so that two-dimensional mapping for the radio sun can easily be
achieved. Recently, one of the interesting results was published by making use a UK
made telescope at University of Baghdad (Jallod and Abood, 2019). However, the
excellent results for the cm bands radio wave can be attributed to the extensive study
from Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope Observations (Velusamy et al., 2020).
From their study, the observations obtained made us believe that the radio emission
originated in the chromosphere and corona; furthermore, they achieved to obtain the
source brightness temperatures and angular sizes as a function of frequency. These
results were made known in terms of gyroresonance mechanism across the active
region of the sun.

Solar eclipse is a rare and attractive event occurring 2 or 5 times per year.
Optical astronomers usually study the solar features happening at the photosphere,
chromosphere and corona. We did combine radio observations for the 2019 and 2020
solar eclipses by making use 3 small radio telescopes in Hong Kong. The results were
cross checked as to identify any discrepancy. The dates of observations were on 26th
of December, 2019 and 21st of June, 2020, respectively. This paper will mainly
discuss one of the most comprehensive observation result among those trials, others
will be included in Appendix section.

This study has three goals. First, to obtain the time variation of radio two-
dimensional spatial mapping of solar eclipses. Second, to obtain total radio ﬂux
density time curves (light curve analogy in radio). Lastly, to verify if 21 cm radio
band can reveal any physical properties of solar eclipses through analyzing historical
worldwide radio eclipses. This paper is also a collection of historic radio observa-
tions in Hong Kong, which will make further studies of comparison between radio
quiet zone in Hong Kong and that in other countries feasible. Italy, in which our
telescopes’ manufacturer Radio2space Company bases, would be the ﬁrst on our list,
as the same SPIDER 300A radio telescope system is also installed at their National
Radio Observatory in Bologna.

2. OBSERVATIONS

Partial Solar Eclipse on June 21, 2020 (magnitude 0.89, max eclipsed area 86.08%)

The radio observations of the eclipse were made on June 21, 2020 at the Ho
Koon Astronomical Center (hereafter HKAC, Longitude: 114o 6′ 29.3076′′E, Lat-
itude: 22o 23′ 1.644′′N , Altitude:149 m), Stanley Ho Astronomical Observatory
(hereafter SHAO, Longitude: 114o 13′ 24.0414′′E, Latitude: 22o14′32.2362′′N ,

Altitude: 4.6 m), and Physics Building Dome of University of Hong Kong (hereafter
HKU, Longitude: 114o 8′ 23.262′′E, Latitude: 22o 13′ 59.7′′N , Altitude: 120 m),
respectively.

Small Radio Telescope (SRT), developed by MIT Haystack Observatory, was
used in HKAC. SRT is centered at 1420 MHz with half-power beamwidth (HPBW)
of 7 degrees. While SPIDER 300A radio telescope systems, developed by Ra-
dio2space Company, were used in both SHAO and HKU. The telescopes were opti-
mized at 1420 MHz with HPBW of 4.03 degrees. The diameters of the telescopes
that we used in SHAO, HKU and HKAC are 3m, 3m and 2.3m respectively with their
corresponding bandwidths at 50MHz, 50MHz and 50kHz. The so-called “on-the-ﬂy
two dimensional mapping” used at SHAO is indeed a mode of moving the antenna
horizontally from left to right. Once the antenna completed mapping the ﬁrst row, it
moves downward and starts the succeeding row. This mode of movement of scanning
horizontally and one row downward will continue and repeat until the designated area
of sky had been fully scanned.

And the “on-off method” is that the antenna will be operated to scan the desig-
nated sky so that the feed horn is made to align to the target “on mode” for a period of
time, occasionally the feed horn is made to align to the ambient space “off mode” for
another period of time as to get the ambient signals. This “on-off method” is adopted
repeatedly during the observing time as to ensure to properly receive the signals as
well as the ambient noises.

Always on-source tracking method was used at HKAC and HKU, while on-
the-ﬂy two-dimensional mapping method was applied at SHAO, which allowed us
to obtain the time variation mapping of radio sun during eclipse, which will then be
presented as sequence diagrams in the later section. The sun was mapped with a 7× 7
grid covering 10 × 10 degrees2, and with step size of 1.6 degrees. Integration time
for each grid was 1 second. All the data recordings were saved in the standard FITS
format.

Unfortunately, data taken at HKU is corrupted which made us impossible to
compare with that from SHAO. Data of HKAC encountered some suspicious prob-
lems which is then put in appendix for further discussion. There was a desperate
failure in tracking the sun. As a result, the data obtained from HKU was not entirely
attributed from the target, so we considered the data corrupted. This paper will be
mainly focused on SHAO data.

Noted that the calibration system of SPIDER 300A is still under development

were used during analysis.

Since the telescope was scanning across the surface of the sun, the offsets be-
tween the telescope axis and the sun in azimuthal and altitude at each moment were
continually varying. Those offset functions of time can be retrieved from ﬁts headers.
We can then scale the received power, which is diminishing along the off-axis dis-
tance, with respect to each channel according to the beam proﬁle. The scaled powers
were added together after ﬂagging particular channels which were severely polluted
by the local interference. We assume the solar power spectrum smooth and without
strong emissions in any particular frequency, so that ﬂagging some channels will not
signiﬁcantly affect the result if we only consider the percentage changes in power
throughout the eclipses. For our SPIDER 300A system is an affordable radio tele-
scope system, the small deviations from the electronic components were inevitable.
During the observation, we made use of different gain values for the both left and
right hand polarization as to minimise the deviation.

For the 2020 eclipse, the sun was observed by on-the-ﬂy two-dimensional map-
ping method mentioned in the previous section. Since the angular distance between
the sun and the measurement center varied from time to time throughout the scan-
ning process, in order to obtain the true radio ﬂux of the sun at each moment, the
power diminishing effect along off-axis distance must be compensated according to
the beam proﬁle. The offset distances and beam parameters could be found in FITS,
through dividing measured ﬂux by beam respond at corresponding offset, time series
of the power change will then be obtained. Power of the uneclipsed sun is estimated
by averaging the data from −6 hr. to −2 hr. before the eclipse maximum.

For comparison, the change of eclipsed area is also included in the plots noted
as optical. Equatorial positions of the sun and the moon were calculated by Skyﬁeld
(Rhodes, 2019), and the area changed was calculated according to equations provided
in Maplesoft webpage (Jason, 2019).

4. DISCUSSION

For this study, we accomplished the 3 major goals mentioned in the Introduc-
tion section. Hence, for this discussion, we will make reference on these 3 goals to
proceed with detailed consideration.

Time variation of radio two-dimensional spatial mapping of solar eclipses

The two-dimensional mapping false colour diagram was created by making use
of the 1.42 GHz uncalibrated SPIDER 300A data in arbitrary units from 2020 eclipse
at SHAO. The location for the SHAO is in the valley of the Tai Tam reservoir, where

5

a hill blocks the west side of the sky, the last hour of 2020 eclipse was not recorded.
Fortunately, the sequence diagrams demonstrating the ﬁrst contact, partial phases and
the maximum eclipse of the partial solar eclipse were obtained. Please be reminded
that this was 0.89 partial solar eclipse instead of total solar eclipse.

The mapping result is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows a mapping diagram before
the solar eclipse. The UT that we made the ﬁgure was at 03:56. We adopted 2s for the
integration time and a step size is of 1.614 degree for each pixel. Fig. 1 was obtained
before the solar eclipse. It was included as to give a proper comparison to the later
ﬁgure obtained during the eclipse. Fig. 2 shows the real time dual circular polariza-
tion time plots generated from the built-in software RadioUniversePRO v.1.4.8. Fig.
2 shows schematically a part of real time intensity changes during mapping as the
telescope beam scanning across the sun. The intensity was found to vary as shown in
Fig. 2.

We would admit that it took roughly 15 minutes for a scanning and the follow-
up scanning which included the mechanical movement by the antenna, setting of the
device parameters, the ﬁne tuning during the observation, recording the data, and
the resetting for the follow-up scanning. New mapping with the same setting was
repeated immediately after the previous scan. The whole process continued until the
sun was blocked by the hills at west of SHAO. A sequence of 10×10 degrees2 images
of the eclipsed sun was then obtained. Fig. 3 shows an example for the uneclipsed
sun that observed in some other day for comparison. Fig. 4 shows a sequence of
diagrams as to present the different stages of the eclipse.

Fig. 4 clearly shows that the received power of the sun decreases as the eclipsed
area increases. Since the beam of the telescope is 4.03 degrees, which is much larger
than that of the sun (<1 degree); unlike what we expect in optical images, the radio
morphology of the sun remains circular throughout the process.

The latter half of the sequence diagrams of the eclipse demonstrates the effect
from the blockage of the hills nearby. Although our sequence diagrams are not able
to cover the whole eclipse from the start to the end, the moment of the maximum
eclipse (frames from UT06:28 to UT09:19 in Fig. 4 ) is recorded, enabling further
analysis of the process from the beginning to the maximum of radio eclipse. For
interpolation of Fig. 4, we use “RectBivariateSpline” function from SciPy package
to interpolate data over rectangular meshes by bivariate spline approximation. In our
actual operation, 36 values are interpolated between meshes in each direction, with 3
degrees of the bivariate spline. More comprehensive radio solar eclipse observations
from better sites with better occasions and better instrumental conditions in coming
years are expected, our result will serve as one of those records in Asia for future
studies.

Based on the data processing described, the percentage change of received ra-

dio power during the eclipse is shown in Fig. 5 for 2020 partial eclipse.

As the resolution of the radio observation is less than that of the optical, pre-
vious studies (Sherwood, 1978; Tan et al., 2009) showed that the radio sun in 21 cm
appeared larger than that in optical, wider and shallower dips of radio power change
compared to that of optical are to be expected. Our results from 2020 eclipse agree
with the expected demonstrating shallower dip when compare with the optical eclipse
models. For SHAO 2020 data, although we covered the very beginning of the eclipse,
no signiﬁcant delay is found from the reduced data. We postulate the delay may be
too small due to the almost perpendicular intersecting angle between the sun and the
moon such that our instrument was not sensitive enough to determine the beginning
moment of the radio eclipse. The expected delay mentioned is reasonably attributed
to different paths, and so different thickness of the atmosphere of the optical and ra-
dio waves taken passing through between the almost perpendicular angle and later
more “inclined angle” for the Sun’s positions appeared in the sky. And no signiﬁ-
cant delay was found. If more data at around −2 hour before eclipse maximum were
obtained, a better estimation might be achieved.

From the light curve, we found the drop in radio power is 55± 5% at maximum
eclipse, which means that the radio radius of the Sun is larger than that in optical.
We can estimate the ratio between radio solar radius and that of optical from their
differences in power drop. the simulation result is shown in Fig. 6. Assuming the
radio behavior of the sun is similar to that in optical, the morphology of radio pattern
is basically symmetric circular disc. We can obtain the expected light curves by
substituting different solar radii(ranging from 1 to 1.5 solar radius) in the equation
(Jason, 2019). The most ﬁtted model would indicate the measured solar radius of our
observations.

During the solar eclipse, the eclipsed area in optical was smaller than that of
the radio signals. Therefore, the power drop of the signals in optical would be more
than that of the radio. And the result was shown in Fig. 6.

Solar radius is scaled with speciﬁc factors to see how the curves change. From
the above result, we estimated that the radio solar radius is roughly 1.4±0.1 of that
in optical. (Sherwood, 1978; Tan et al., 2009)

5. CONCLUSION

Based on the above observational results, we were glad to have accomplished
the original planned goals for this study. Firstly, we managed to obtain the two-
dimensional radio mapping animation for the 0.89 partial solar eclipse on 21 June

2020 in Hong Kong. The radio eclipsed area in 2020 partial solar eclipse as observed
was different and not in proportion to that of the optical as expected. There was about
55 ± 5% of the maximum radio eclipse recorded compared to a 86.08% eclipsed area
in optical. And the radio solar radius detected during the solar eclipse in 21 cm was
related to chromosphere and corona, but not to the photosphere. The photosphere of
the sun deﬁnes the solar disc optically. During the solar eclipse, the optical light of
the sun is blocked by the moon. The radio signals in 21 cm at the chromosphere and
the corona of the sun, however, remain observable during the solar eclipse. There-
fore, we may recognise the signals observed as the radio solar disc.

The 2020 observation for the 21 cm radio solar eclipse was the unprecedented
in Hong Kong. Probably, other South East Asia countries may have similar observa-
tions. Therefore, our observation data obtained can serve effectively to contribute to
the radio data all over the world.

There was a radio quiet zone in Hong Kong, such that we propose constructing
a radio interferometer array over there. In fact, we wish to implement the plan soon
since it is reasonably good for the development in radio astronomy in Hong Kong.

And we developed a simple systematic pipeline data reduction approach for
dealing with the data obtained from the SPIDER 300A telescope. And the calibration
function for the SPIDER telescope is expected to be completed soon, and hence we
can properly calibrate all the coming observational results.

The results we have obtained are good enough for initiating further studies and
collaborations with other countries and research groups, and for comparing our data
with their results.

APPENDIX A.

The same set of SPIDER 300A telescope is also used in 2019 partial solar

eclipse observation in Hong Kong. The details will be discussed here.

The radio observations of the eclipse were made on December 26 at the HKAC,
SHAO, and HKU, respectively. The magnitude of the eclipse is 0.46, indicating that
the maximum eclipsed area is 34.32%. SPIDER 300A radio telescope systems were
used in both SHAO and HKU. Always on-source tracking method was used for all
observations. Unfortunately, data collected at HKU is corrupted, only the result from
SHAO will be discussed in this section, namely SHAO 2019.

Different from that of 2020 eclipse, since the telescope was always tracking at
the sun, we can simply add up all data from different channels covering the interested
frequency range to obtain time series of the ﬂux change. As the instrument was not
calibrated, measurement of uneclipsed sun is preferred for estimating the percentage
of power change during eclipse. Unfortunately, this observation only covered the ﬁrst
half of the event, we have no clue about the total ﬂux of the uneclipsed sun measured
by the same set of instruments. At the best we could do, we take the maximum power
of the time series as an educated or reasonable guess of the power of the uneclipsed
sun, which inevitably did introduce systematic error but at a possible minimum level.
The result is presented in Fig. 7.

From the analysis, the SHAO 2019 data show a shallower dip (18± 5%) when
compare with that in optical (34.32%). Since it did not cover the very beginning of
the eclipse, we cannot tell whether radio eclipse begin earlier than optical eclipse
from this data set.

APPENDIX B.

As mentioned in observation section, HKAC also participated in the 2020
eclipse observation. While SPIDER 300A record data by on-the-ﬂy method in SHAO,
SRT, used in HKAC, only record the raw readings from the detector, of which the sky
background must be accounted before data analysis ( so called “on-off mode” ). The
raw eclipsed data are presented in Fig. 8 as the red solid line.

We cannot tell when the sun is eclipsed without further data reduction. In order
to obtain the radio power difference between eclipsed and uneclipsed sun measured
by the SRT at HKAC, another measurement of the sun was made 5 days later, as
shown in Fig. 9. It provided us the variation of solar radio power along solar elevation
measured by our SRT. The data is then approximated by ﬁtting a polynomial as shown
as orange solid line in Fig. 9 and dotted line in Fig. 8. By comparing the difference
between two curves, atmospheric factors are eliminated, and variation of the eclipse
can be revealed as shown in Fig. 10.

The reduced data shows a reasonable dip indicating a typical eclipse event.
However, our data also show a large time shift between radio data and optical model.
We have no clue of the reasons behind the shift. It could be instrumental errors or
methodological errors. We tried everything to identify the sources of error, but it did
not help. We note this data as highly suspicious and hope more insight would be
offered in the future.

APPENDIX C.

We collected many interesting signals in Hong Kong sky which contributed to
the historical detection in 21cm line in Hong Kong. Fig. 11 show the radio mapping
of the galactic center, also known as Sagittarius A∗.
