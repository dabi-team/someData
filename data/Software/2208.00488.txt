Abstract—High-quality data has become increasingly important to software engineers in
designing and implementing today’s software, for example, as an input to machine-learning
algorithms and visualisation- and analytics-based features. Open data – i.e., data shared under
a licence that gives users the right to study, process, and distribute the data to anyone and for
any purpose – oﬀers a mechanism to address this need. Data may originate from multiple
sources, whether crowdsourced, shared by government agencies, or shared between
commercial entities, and is undoubtedly inherent to all business and revenue models across
the public sector, business and industry today. In this guest editorial for the Special Issue on
Collaborative Aspects of Open Data in Software Engineering, we explore the collaborative
aspects of open data in software engineering. We highlight how these aspects can beneﬁt
organisations, what challenges may exist and how these may be addressed based on current
practice, and introduce the four papers included in this special issue.

Consistent with previous work,

this editorial
defines open data as machine-readable data
pro-actively shared on the internet under a
licence that gives users the right to use, process,
and distribute the data to anyone and for any
purpose [1].

The open in open data highlights the potential
for open innovation and collaboration around the
data. Such collaboration can range from the

overview of the included papers in this special

practice.

Collaboration on open data often occurs in
what is called Open Data Ecosystems (ODE),
where OpenStreetMap and Wikidata are two
popular examples. These ecosystems represent
a form of networked communities of actors
(organizations and individuals), which base their
relations to each other on a common interest [4].
The common interest is creating and providing

actors within the ecosystem to process data (e.g.,

organizations with shared business interests in
the data shared within the ecosystem. Examples
from research can be found within domains such
as labor market, public transport, smart cities,
and industry 4.0, where both public and private
organizations hold and share governance in
different constellations [3].

ranging from the data providers to the data users.
Lindman et al. [5] identified five roles in this type
of collaboration: open data publishers, data
extractors and transformers, data analyzers,
user-experience providers, and support-service
providers. These are needed to get a fully
functional pipeline from data to user service, and
may be filled by actors within or across
organizations. The data publisher is commonly a
public entity as sharing of open data from private
entities is not yet a common phenomena [4].

Successfully combining the digital competences
with the application domain requires willingness
and ability to cross cultural and language
barriers. Further, as legal conditions for the use
and spreading of data is foundational
for
data-driven software development, the ability to
understand and communicate with jurists is
essential.

BENEFITS OF COLLABORATION ON OPEN

DATA

Collaboration on open data has the potential
to generate value similar to OSS and other types
of Open Innovation. This comes as an effect from
tapping into the wisdom of
the crowd and
exploiting the potential workforce within and
outside of an ODE.

From a cost-saving perspective, the potential
external workforce may help in tasks such as
providing, collecting, processing and publishing
data [4]. As highlighted, an ODE can be
resembled to a value chain where the raw

collaborative manner [5]. Reaching outside of an

From a quality perspective, collaboration on
the open data can, e.g., help to address and
correct errors, but also add information to the
data through annotations and other kinds of

meta-data [4]. As a consequence, the quality of
ML-training sets and software using the data will
be improved. This applies also to Open
Governmental Data [3], where users may help
improve data quality for the public agencies.

From an innovation perspective, the potential
increased access to high-quality data can further
help to provide new and extended training sets
for ML-based applications as well as feature sets
forms of data-driven software (e.g.,
to other
Google Maps).
Innovation can further be
accelerated as new use cases and markets may
get extended or created for the ODE, or even
trigger the creation of new ones. Furthermore,
collaborating through open data may lower the

CHALLENGES AND WAYS OF IMPROVING

COLLABORATION ON OPEN DATA

Sharing and collaborating on open data brings
forward a number of challenges, both technical
and process-oriented, as well as cultural and
business-oriented [4]. Below, we highlight a few
of these challenges that practitioners may need
to consider within an ODE or when thinking of
entering or creating one

Business and Competition Aspects
From a business perspective, an important
challenge concerns the motivation of why a data
set should be shared in the first place [3]. There
needs to be business incentives that align with
the company’s business model. Practitioners
hence need to understand aforementioned
benefits and be able to contextualize these in
their own environment and relate to relevant
business goals.

The benefits further need to be nuanced and
weighed against the potential costs and risks of
releasing the data. Potential costs may be related
i.e.,

sharing, and distribution of
the data. As with
OSS, these costs as well as the potential benefits
relate to the amount of collaboration that actually
takes place. Hence, actors within an ODE must
find ways for
facilitating and orchestrating a
sustainable collaboration and sharing of data.

for

A specific challenge for such collaboration is
the notion of co-opetition [4], i.e., a space where
competitors can collaborate with each other
without being afraid of giving away or losing their
competitive edge [8], which can be a significant
sharing.
commercial
obstacle
Researchers and companies may not be willing
to openly share their data on novel software
innovations and services since this reduces their
own ability to commercially exploit them [9]. On
the other hand, commodity data may be a basis
for

co-opetition,

data

as

To manage and enable such co-opetition,
there may be a need for a neutral governance
actor within the ecosystem that can mediate
the
discussions, craft a common vision for
ecosystem, and help actors share data that
everyone is comfortable with [3]. The latter,
commonly referred to as selective revealing, can
involve e.g., that only certain abstractions of data
are shared.

Technical Aspects

The potential collaborational aspects also
bring up a number of more technical challenges
[4]. One such challenge concerns the collection
of data and how to ensure its quality. Some
scholars indicate that datasets of
insufficient
quality may be misinterpreted or misused [10],
rather
than improving the quality of software.
Common domain models and standards for how
the data is shared and used, as well as
transparent processes and OSS tools for
collection and enrichment of the data, contribute
to address this challenge.

Introducing feedback-loops both within an
ODE and towards the end-users is another
means, which is specifically highlighted and
addressed by Rudmark and Andersson in this
issue. Versioning the data is another
special

practical aspect that needs consideration in order
to enable decentralized collaboration, similar to
what can be observed in OSS ecosystems.
Worthington et al. explore this topic further in
their contribution to this special issue.

Cultural, Organizational, and Legal Aspects

Cultural and organizational aspects is another
set of challenges [4], e.g., aligning strategic and
operational levels within an organization on what
data to share.
Individuals may have different
views or understanding of the risks and benefits
that sharing would imply. These challenges may
also be manifested in the collection and
collaboration of the data, as again, individuals of
different backgrounds and cultures may have
mis-aligned perspectives. This challenge is
further explored by Thurney et al. in this special
issue, who highlight the need for practitioners to
educate each other based on their different
domain knowledge and understanding.

Another set of challenges are related to legal
conditions [4]. Organizations may be reluctant to
share data due to uncertainty about liability and
what licences may imply in practice. Risk of legal
complications due to GDPR is a specific and
common concern under European legislation.
for example, collect and maintain

data which they may be reluctant
to share
through collaborations [5]. Enabling individuals to
gain control of how their data is shared (cf.
MyData ) may be one way of addressing this
rather difficult challenge, an area that is further
explored by Alorwu et al. in their contribution to
this special issue.

OVERVIEW OF THE SPECIAL ISSUE PAPERS

This special

issue covers different

topics
related to collaborative aspects of open data in
Software Engineering. Out of
the 9 submitted
papers, we selected 4 papers for this special
issue. We applied a rigorous review process to
each article, including a review by at least three

reviewers. Below we summarize the

expert
papers.

The first article deals with the originators of
data. Alorwu et al. elaborate on the contributors
of crowdsourced data in the health domain. Open
health data may be used for research and as
inputs for digital health software solutions. They
surveyed 80 participants, who previously donated
health data to a decision support system, asking
about their willingness to donate data for public
use. They find that data donators, despite
donating data as “open”, wanted to influence for
what, by whom, and where their data were used.
The respondents voice limited trust
in private
stakeholders,
such as pharmaceutical and
insurance companies, and bring up privacy
concerns with donating data. The authors
conclude by connecting these concerns with the
MyData initiative, providing mechanisms for
donors to keep control of their data, still allowing
it to be used for permitted purposes.

Next, Rudmark and Andersson focus on the
quality of data and which role feedback loops
may have to improve data quality. The feedback
may be given by the data publishers themselves,
or by data re-users. Further, the feedback may
come from internal or external use of the data.
With examples from public transport data, they
present data dogfooding – data providers use
their own data; external application monitoring –
the data provider monitor how their data is used
in other actors’ applications; community curation
– the actors work together on improving the data
quality; and external quality proxy – letting an
external actor check the data before publishing it.

SUMMARY OF PRACTICE

Demand for high-quality data is growing as are
the costs and resources for collecting and
managing it. As a response, open data offers a
new arena for open collaboration and innovation
on data similar to OSS. Yet, software engineering
practices have not kept pace in terms of enabling
such collaboration. In part, there is a need for the
evolution of open data ecosystems, similar to
open source communities, that can facilitate such
collaboration and sharing of data between actors,
independent of aligning or competing interests.
