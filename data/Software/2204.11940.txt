Abstract 
The paper presents a survey of the main numerical models used for simulation of interaction of 
accelerated particle beams with target nuclei. These models form the core of the software for 
simulation of various experiments and experimental facilities both for scientific and applied 
purposes. The beam and target parameters considered in detail in this study (protons and 
deuterons with energies from 0.66 to 4 AGeV and bulk U targets) cover the range of interest in 
development of new concepts of nuclear power production aided by accelerated particle beams.

INTRODUCTION 

Numerical study of ADS systems, namely, interaction of accelerated proton and light ion beams 
with extended targets, encounters a well known problem of description of neutron breeding in 
such systems. Various approaches and numerical models differ in their predictions of neutron 
yield and spectrum up to a factor of two. That is why the comparative examination of the widely 
used models and codes for description of interaction of accelerated ion beams with heavy bulk 
targets with the idea of further experimental verification is important. 

The intranuclear cascade(INC) approach was apparently first developed by Goldberger [1], who 
in turn based his work on the ideas of Heisenberg and Serber [2], who regarded intranuclear

cascades as a series of independent collisions using on-mass-shell free particle-nucleon cross 
sections. The colliding particles are treated as classical point-like objects moving between 
collisions on well defined trajectories in the target potential well. 

Many intra-nuclear cascade models have been proposed and developed in the past by several 
groups. In many cases the motivation was to provide a satisfactory level of description of final-
state hadron spectra in the problem of few MeV to few GeV reactions of hadrons with nuclei. 
They find application in low-energy calorimetry, studies of nucleon shielding, accelerator based 
nuclear-waste degradation, neutrino beams, or studies of design and application of spallation 
neutron sources. 

Let’s remind the main basic assumptions of the INC. The main condition for the applicability of 
the intranuclear cascade model is that the DeBroglie wavelength λ of the particles participating 
in the interaction be sufficiently small: It is necessary that for most of these particles λ be less 
than the average distance between the intranuclear nucleons Δ ∼ 10−13 cm. Only in this case does 
the particle acquire quasi-classical features and can we speak approximately of particle trajectory 
and two-particle collisions inside the nucleus. It is clear that for this to be the case the primary 
particle kinetic energy T must be greater than several tens of MeV. 

Another important condition for applicability of the INC is the requirement that the time in 
which an individual two-particle intranuclear collision occurs on the average, τ ∼ 10−23 s, be less 
than the time interval between two such consecutive interactions

where l is the mean range of the cascade particle before the interaction, c is the velocity of light, 
R= 𝑟?𝐴@ ,⁄ 	is the mean radius of the nucleus, and σ is the cross section for interaction with an 
intranuclear nucleon. This permits the interaction of the incident particle with the nucleus to be 
reduced to a set of individual statistically independent intranuclear collisions. 

Since the energy of the particles participating in the cascade is greater than the binding energy of 
the intranuclear nucleons − the same characteristics can be used for interaction of cascade 
particles inside the nucleus as for the interaction of free particles. The effect of other intranuclear 
nucleons is taken into account by introduction of some average potential V , and also by the 
action of the Pauli principle. The nucleus is considered to be a degenerate Fermi gas of nucleons 
enclosed in the nuclear volume. Both projectile and nucleus have to be initialized. Regarding the 
projectile, type and energy are known, but its impact parameter is taken randomly and coulomb 
deviation considered. If the projectile is a composite particle, its structure must be given in the 
same way as for the target. The target nucleus is defined by its mass, its charge, the potentials 
felt by the particles, the momentum of each nucleon (most of the time a Fermi gas distribution is 
used), and the spatial distribution of the nucleons. Two ways exist to define this distribution. The 
distribution is either continuous, often several concentric density regions, or discrete, i.e. 

	
positions are sampled in a Wood-Saxon distribution, for example. According to the Pauli 
principle, the nucleons, after an intranuclear collision, must have energy above the Fermi energy; 
otherwise such an interaction is forbidden. The effect of Pauli principle is very important. The 
action of the Pauli principle leads to an increase of the mean free path of fast particles inside the 
nucleus. It is especially pronounced at Einc< 40 MeV causing to rise even though the nucleon-
nucleon cross section is strongly increasing. Understanding of the limitations of INC at low 
energies is important for evaluation of reliability of transport calculations used in wide variety of 
applications. In collisions of high energy particle with the Fermi sea, the momentum transfer is 
small, and Pauli principle limits the interaction to small fraction of the Fermi sea close to its 
surface, thus increasing the mean free path. Most of the collisions are not central. Calculations 
show that in the energies of few tens to few hundreds MeV about 60% of the collisions leading 
to inelastic reactions occur at impact parameters at which the nuclear density is less than a half of 
the central density. The target periphery is modelled in all the INC implementations, but each has 
a different way to deal with the low energy participants chosen considering agreement with the 
experimental data rather than from basic physical considerations. The incident particle and target 
constituents are moving on classical trajectories in the potential well and scatter whenever their 
relative distance is less than B𝜎(𝐸DE)/𝜋, σ(Ecm) being the free space cross section, and Ecm their 
center of mass energy. 

Two different methods are applied to move and follow the particles participating to the cascade. 
With the time-like transport all particles are followed at the same time, while with the space-like 
transport the particles are followed one after another. 

Three events exist during the intranuclear cascade: collision, resonance decay and 
reflection/transmission at the nucleus surface. Collisions can be elastic or inelastic. Most of the 
time experimental data (cross sections) are used to define interaction probabilities first and 
second what are the output products and their characteristics (types, energies, momenta), each 
selection being done randomly. When necessary, Pauli blocking is taken into account. Cross-
section parameterizations, number and type of collisions and of resonances taken into account, 
and the way to apply Pauli blocking different for different models. 

When the particle reaches the surface; it can be emitted or reflected. To be emitted the particle 
must be energetic enough, i.e. be able to overcome nuclear and Coulomb potential. However, the 
basics of INC are clearly the treatment of the transport of nucleons with their two-body 
interactions, i.e. without clusterization. So, up to now,, the only way to produce composite 
particles during the cascade is to add a coalescence model. Before leaving the nucleus, a nucleon 
can drag and aggregate one or more nucleons, close enough to it in space and momentum. This 
procedure extends the INC applicability to a satisfactory level. 

Finally, different criteria are used to stop the cascade and to start the de-excitation phase of the 
remnant nucleus. We can mention three of them: cutoff energy, stopping time and deviation from 
an optical absorptive potential. 

Different scenarios for intranuclear cascade are possible depending on the energy and the impact 
parameter of the incident particle going from ejection of a single nucleon, taking with it all of the 
incident energy, to the capture of the projectile leaving the nucleus in a state of strong excitation. 
Once excited, the nucleus enters a second and slower phase, the de-excitation. Here again, 
different scenarios compete according to the mass, excitation energy and angular momentum of 
the remnant nucleus. The first and rapid phase is of about 10−22 s and the second in the order of 
10−18 s. In addition to these two phases sometimes included is a third one named pre-equilibrium. 
This step is actually an intermediate step since it deals with the transition between cascade and 
de-excitation and more precisely how the cascade is stopped. The need of this additional phase is 
then strongly connected with the cascade modeling. 

INC reproduces successfully a wide variety of experimental data of hadron and pion induced 
reactions, using a small number of adjustable parameters, most with clear physical meaning. 

I. LIEGE INTRANUCLEAR-CASCADE MODEL INCL4.6 

The original Liege INC model for nucleon-induced reactions is described in [3, 4]. The standard 
INCL4.2 model is described in detail in [5, 6] and in references cited therein. The INCL4 model 
is a time-like intranuclear cascade model. In the initial state, all nucleons are prepared in phase 
space. Target nucleons are given position and momentum at random in agreement with Saxon-
Woods and Fermi sphere distributions, respectively. They are moving in a constant potential well 
describing the nuclear mean field. The incident particle (nucleon or pion) is given the appropriate 
energy and an impact parameter at random. In this version, incident light particles (up to alphas) 
are viewed as a collection of on-shell nucleons, with a Fermi motion inside their reference frame, 
and with a total energy equal to the nominal total incident energy. The collision mechanism is 
assumed to proceed from a succession of binary collisions (and decays) well separated in space 
and time. The fate of all particles is followed as time evolves. The particles travel along a 
straight-line trajectories until two of them reach their minimum distance of approach, in which 
case they can be scattered provided the value of this distance is small enough, or until they hit 
the border of the potential well, supposed to describe the nuclear target mean field. Initial 
positions of target nucleons are taken at random in the spherical nuclear target volume with a 
sharp surface, initial momenta are generated stochastically in a Fermi sphere. Inelastic collisions, 
pion production, and absorption are supposed to appear and disappear through the 𝑁𝑁 ⇌ 𝑁∆ and 
∆⇌ 𝜋𝑁	reactions. For πN interaction, experimental cross sections are uses, including 
nonresonant scattering, but the latter is treated as proceeding through the formation of a Δ with a 
very short lifetime; inelastic πN scattering is neglected for convenience. In the NN → NΔ 
process, the Δ particle is given the mass mΔ , taken at random from the distribution

with mΔ lying in the interval [𝑚K + 𝑚_, √𝑠 − 𝑚K], √𝑠 being the center of mass (c.m.) energy of 
the collision, and consistent with energy-momentum conservation. The quantity FN in Eq. (1) is

be justified as follows: a Δ resonance is a correlated pion-nucleon system and the phase space of 
the latter system is considerably reduced when its c.m. energy is low. The average intrinsic

is considerably diminished due the reduction of phase space. The stopping time of the cascade is

for incident nucleons(ZT and AT are the charge and mass numbers of the target, respectively). At 
the beginning of the cascade process, the incident nucleon or pion is located with its own impact 
parameter on the surface of the working sphere, which is centered on the target with the radius 

𝑅Est = 𝑅? + 8𝑎, (5) 

where R0 and a are respectively the radius and the diffuseness of the target nucleus density. 
Particles are moving along straight-line trajectories between collisions inside the working sphere. 
They are divided into participants and spectators in the usual sense. When participants leave the 
working sphere, they are considered as ejectiles and do not interact anymore. The potential 
radius for particles with energy larger than the Fermi energy is also taken to be equal to Rmax. 
Pions do not experience any potential. The depth of the potential well felt by the nucleons is 
dependent on the energy of the nucleons and is not the same for protons and neutrons. The 
energy dependence is taken from the phenomenology of the real part of the optical-model 
potential.

The values of R0 and a are taken from electron scattering measurements and parameterized, for 
convenience, from Al to U, as follows: R0 = (2.745x10−4AT + 1.063)(AT)1/3 fm, 𝑎 = 0.510 + 
1.63x10−4AT fm (in the numerical code, other values, as well as another shape for ρ(r), can 

optionally be introduced). The quantity ρ0 is such that the distribution is normalized to AT , the 
target mass number. The momentum distribution is kept as a uniform Fermi sphere with Fermi 
momentum pF. Nucleons with high momentum in the central part of the nucleus are expected to 
travel farther out than those with low momentum. 

Therefore it is considered that a nucleon with the momentum p is to reach the maximum radial 
distance R(p). Because of these r-p correlations, a nucleon with the momentum between p and p 
+ dp should be located, with a constant uniform probability, in a sphere of the radius R(p). This 
radius can be deduced by assuming that the number of nucleons populating the layer of density 
profile ρ(R(p)) and ρ(R(p + dp)) is the same as the number of nucleons with the momentum 
between p and p + dp:

from which R(p) can be deduced. The initial position and momentum of any target nucleon are 
generated as follows: 𝑝⃗	is taken at random in a sphere with the radius pF , R(p) is calculated using 
Eq. (8), and 𝑟⃗ is chosen at random in a sphere with the radius R(p). This is equivalent to taking 𝑟⃗,

where θ(x) is the Heaviside function. In practice, the value of p can be generated from the 
uniform Fermi sphere distribution and the position is generated uniformly in a sphere with the

The procedure outlined above is at variance with the one used in many transport models, where 
nucleons are placed in a potential with a Saxon-Woods or similar shape. The dynamical Pauli

where the sum is limited to particles k with the same isospin component as particle i (or j). The 
factor ½ is introduced because spin components are ignored. The parameters rPB and pPB were 
taken to have the following values: rPB = 3.18 fm and pPB = 200 MeV/c. The collision between i 
and j is allowed or forbidden following the comparison of a random number with the product (1 
−fi)(1 − fj ). Pauli blocking is not applied to Δ particles because their density is always very 
small. On the other hand, it is enforced for nucleons resulting from Δ decays. At the end of the 
cascade, surviving Δ resonances from inelastic collisions are forced to decay and the 
conservation of baryon number, charge, energy, momentum and angular momentum is verified,

for baryon number, charge, energy, momentum, and angular momentum, respectively. The 
projectile P colliding with the target T and generating (baryonic) ejectiles, pions, and a remnant

Eq. (15), Kej is the kinetic energy of the ejectiles, Wp is the total energy of the pions, Erec is the 
recoil energy of the remnant, E∗ is the remnant excitation energy, and S is the separation energy, 
i.e., the minimum energy needed to remove all ejectiles and pions from the target nucleus ground

motion of the remnant, and 𝑙∗êê⃗ is the intrinsic angular momentum of the remnant. The INCL4.2 
version was tested successfully, in the 200 MeV - 2 GeV range, against a large data base, but 
some phenomenological aspects of nuclear physics were neglected. The model cannot describe 
production of clusters in the cascade, i.e. with a kinetic energy definitely larger than the typical 
evaporation energies, as it can be seen experimentally. Concerning the predictive power of the 
model, several deficiencies can be noted. Pion production is generally overestimated. Quasi-
elastic peaks in (p, n) reactions are generally too narrow and sometimes underestimated. Finally, 
the reaction cross sections are severely underestimated below ~100 MeV. Residue production 
cross sections are sometimes unsatisfactorily reproduced, especially for residues close to the 
target. 

In 2009, an upgraded version (INCL4.5) was released [6] where the following model 
improvements were implemented. 

An average isospin-dependent potential well, of the Lane type, is introduced for pions, as well as 
reflection and/or transmission at the border of this potential. The depth of the potential was taken 
as far as possible from the phenomenology of the real part of the pion-nucleus optical potential 
(dispersive effects due to the strong imaginary part have to be removed). This depth amounts to 
22 MeV for π+ and 38 MeV for π− on the Pb target. The radius of the potential is taken as 
R0+4𝑎, in rough accordance with phenomenology. This modification reduces the pion production 
cross section, thus compensating the overestimation by INCL4.2. 

Est = 8 are considered. The emitted cluster should have sufficient energy to 

An improvement of the INCL4.2 model is that outgoing nucleon crossing the nuclear periphery 
is supposed to be able to carry along other nucleons to form a cluster, provided the involved 
nucleons are lying sufficiently near each other in phase space. To limitations in computing time, 
clusters up to 𝐴Dù
escape, i.e. 𝑇Dù = ∑(𝑇ë − 𝑉ë) − 𝐵Dù > 0, where the Ti are the kinetic energies of the nucleons and 
Vi are the depths of their potential wells and the cluster has also to succeed the test for 
penetration through the Coulomb barrier. At the end of the cascade process, short-lived clusters 
with a lifetime of less than 1 ms (e.g. 5Li) are forced to decay, isotropically in their c.m. frame. 
Clusters with a lifetime larger than 1 ms are considered detectable, prior to decay. 

In this way, the following features are introduced. First, the deflection of charged particles in the 
Coulomb field was taken into account, both for incident and outgoing particle at the nuclear 
periphery. Second, light charged particles can be emitted by the cascade owing to a dynamical 
coalescence model: nucleons leaving the target may carry other nucleons provided they are 
sufficiently close by in phase space. Third, the behavior of the model at low incident energy is 
improved, mainly by a better account of soft collisions, especially in the first instances of the 
reaction process. 

Finally, the last version of the model, INCL4.6, was published in 2013. A detailed account can 
be found in [7]. The main new development involves the treatment of cluster-induced reactions. 

Treatment of cluster-induced reactions is as follows. In INCL4.2, an incident cluster (up to an 
alpha particle) is considered as a collection of independent nucleons with internal Fermi motion 
superimposed to the motion of the incident cluster as a whole (see [5]), adjusted in such a way 
that the sum of the total energies of the constituting nucleons is equal to the nominal energy of 
the physical cluster. In other words, the cluster is replaced by independent on-shell nucleons with 
the correct nominal total energy, but with an incorrect (smaller than nominal) total momentum. 
This approximation is justified at high energy, but it is not really appropriate for reactions at low 
incident energy. 

£êêê⃗	i inside 
Initialization of the incident cluster is as follows. Nucleon momenta 𝑝é
the cluster are generated as before [5] (note, however, that a special method is applied to ensure 
£êêê⃗ = 0). At the beginning of the event, the cluster center of mass is positioned on 
∑ 𝑝é
the classical Coulomb trajectory in such a way that one of the nucleons is touching a sphere of 

£êêê⃗ and positions 𝑟é

£êêê⃗ = 0 and ∑ 𝑟é

radius RCoul. The latter represents the Coulomb barrier. The value of RCoul is taken from the 
phenomenology of the Coulomb barrier heights and has been tabulated as function of the target 
mass for p, d, t, 3He and 4He projectiles. 

Collisions are, of course, governed by Pauli blocking, treated in a different way in the first and in 
the subsequent collisions. The nucleons involved in the first collision are subject to a strict 
blocking: after the collision, both of them should lie outside the Fermi sphere. In subsequent 
collisions, the blocking is applied stochastically, with a probability given by the product of final 
state blocking factors. A careful definition of the latter allows one to account for surface effects 
and for the depletion of the Fermi sphere during the evolution of the cascade.  

An important novelty of recent versions of the code is the introduction of a coalescence model 
based on phase space, which permits the emission of light clusters, with mass A ≤ 8, during the 
cascade stage, in keeping with experimental evidence. 

The INCL4.6 version uses modified value for Rmax 

Rmax=R0+	8𝑎+rint = R1+ 8𝑎, (18) 

l•¶i , taken 
and the model separation energy Si is replaced by the physical separation energy 𝑆ë
from mass tables, for the emission from the actual nucleus. The modification of Rmax increased 
the maximum time of the cascade, which now corresponds to the time of passage of the incident 
particle through the “working sphere” along a diameter, when this time exceeds the usual 
stopping time, given by Eq. (4). 

An important characteristic of the model is the self-consistent determination of the stopping time 
of the cascade, which can be simply parameterized as 𝑡ijkl = 29.8𝐴q
mass of the target nucleus. At 𝑡 = 𝑡ijkl many physical quantities, such as the excitation energy 
of the target nucleus and the average kinetic energy of the ejectiles, switch from a fast time 
evolution, dominated by intranuclear cascade, to a much slower evolution, which is taken as a 
signature of equilibration. Thanks to this choice of the stopping time, it is not necessary to 
introduce a pre-equilibrium model describing the intermediate stage between the fast cascade and 
the evaporation-fission decay. 

?.@r fm/s, where AT is the 

Intranuclear-cascade models in general (and INCL in particular) only describe the fast, 
dynamical stage of a spallation reaction, leading to the formation of excited nuclei which 
subsequently de-excite by emitting particles and/or fissioning. It is therefore necessary to follow 
the de-excitation of this cascade remnant if one requires a complete description of the nuclear 
reaction. Since the time scale for de-excitation is much longer than for cascade, a different 
physical description is usually employed. This may include an optional pre-equilibrium stage, 
which then handles the thermalization of the remnant; if pre-equilibrium is used, the 
intranuclear-cascade stage is stopped earlier. Either way, thermalization is attained and 
subsequent de-excitation of the remnant is described by statistical de-excitation models. 

Such a pre-equilibrium model is sometimes used between the cascade and the de-excitation 
phases. Several versions exist, but almost all are based on the exciton model developed by 
Griffin [8]. According to the use or rejection of this intermediate phase, the duration of the 
cascade is obviously different or, maybe more correctly, mass, charge and excitation of the 
remnant nucleus are larger, if this phase is called. While some intranuclear cascade models need 
such pre-equilibrium models to improve their capability, this is not the case of some others. 

Boudard, co-developer of INCL, initiated the translation of the Fortran77 version of INCL in 
C++. The work, started by P. Kaitaniemi [11], was continued and finalized by D. Mancusi [12]. 
This provided the opportunity to re-consider the INCL code and made its maintenance easier. 
The main transport code implemented the INCL4.6 [7] version as the default intranuclear 
cascade model.  

For this purpose, the Liege intranuclear cascade model (INCL) [12] is used; this model has been 
recently extended towards high energies (≈ 15 GeV) including multipion production[13, 14], 
strange particles, such as kaons and hyperons [15, 16], and the production of η and ω mesons 
[17]. This new version of the INCL allows us to predict the formation of hyperremnants and their 
characterization in atomic ,mass, and strangeness numbers together with their excitation energies 
and angular momenta. These improvements in INCL also require de-excitation models 
considering the emission of hyperons, in particular, the evaporation of particles. Currently, there 
are a few numbers of de-excitation models that treat the evaporation of hyperons and the 
formation of hypernuclei, such as the evaporation model ABLA07 developed at GSI by Kelic 
and collaborators [18] and recently extended to hypernuclei by us including the evaporation of 
particles on the basis of Weisskopfs approach according to [19]. 

II. BINARY CASCADE 

Binary Cascade is a hybrid between a classical intranuclear cascade and a QMD[20] model, for 
the simulation of inelastic scattering of pions, protons and neutrons, and light ions of 
intermediate energies off nuclei[21]. The nucleus is modeled by individual nucleons bound in the 
nuclear potential. Binary collisions of projectiles or projectile constituents and secondaries with 
single nucleons, resonance production, and decay are simulated according to measured, 
parameterized or calculated cross sections. The Pauli exclusion principle, i.e. blocking of 
interactions due to Fermi statistics, reduces the free cross section to an effective intra-nuclear 
cross section. Secondary particles are allowed to further interact with remaining nucleons. The 
Binary Cascade models interactions of nucleons, pions, and light ions with nuclei for incident 
particle energies in the energy range starting from few MeV up to few GeV. 

The Binary Cascade introduces a new approach to cascade calculations. It is based on a detailed 
3-dimensional model of the nucleus, and exclusively based on binary scattering between reaction 
participants and nucleons within this nuclear model. This feature makes it a hybrid between a 

 
classical cascade code, and a quantum molecular dynamics model (QMD) [20]. In Binary 
Cascade, like in QMD, each participating nucleon is seen as a Gaussian wave package,

propagating in time and space, undergoing collisions with nucleons in the nuclear medium in the 
process. Here, x and t are space and time coordinates, and qi and pi describe the nucleon position 
in the configuration and momentum space. The total wave function is assumed to be the direct 
product of the wave functions of the participating nucleons and hadrons. Participating means that 
they are either primary particles, or were generated or scattered in the process of the cascade. 

Binary Cascade is an intra-nuclear cascade propagating primary nucleons and all secondary 
particles within a nucleus. Interactions take place between a primary or secondary particle and an 
individual nucleon of the nucleus. The nucleus is modeled by explicitly positioning nucleons in 
space, and assigning momenta to these nucleons. This is done in a way consistent with the 
nuclear density distributions, Pauli’s exclusion principle, and the total nu- clear mass. 

Propagating particles in the nuclear field is done by numerically solving the equations of motion, 
using time-independent fields derived from optical potentials. The cascade begins with a 
projectile and the nuclear description, and terminates when the average energy of all participants 
within the nuclear boundaries are below a given threshold. The remaining pre-fragment will be 
treated by pre-equilibrium decay and de-excitation models. 

For the primary particle an impact parameter is chosen randomly on a disk outside the nucleus, 
perpendicular to a vector passing through the center of the nucleus. The initial direction of the 
primary is perpendicular to this disk. Using straight-line transport, the distance of closest 
approach 𝑑ë
calculated. The interaction cross-section σi with target nucleons is calculated based on the 
momenta of the nucleons in the nucleus, and the projectile momentum. The target nucleons for

partners for the primary. All candidate collisions are ordered by increasing 𝑡ë
found, a new impact parameter is chosen. This way transparency effects at the nuclear 
boundaries are taken into account. The primary particle is then transported in the nuclear field by 
the time step given by the time to closest approach for the earliest collision candidate. Outside 
the nucleus, particles travel along straight-line trajectories. Particles entering the nucleus have 
their energy corrected for Coulomb effects. Inside the nucleus particles are propagated in the 
nuclear field. The equation of motion in the field is solved for a given time step using a Runge-
Kutta integration method. At the end of each step, the interaction of the collision partners is 
simulated using the scattering term described below, resulting in a set of candidate particles for 
further transport. The secondaries from a binary collision are accepted subject to Pauli’s 
exclusion principle. If the momentum of any of the particles is below the Fermi momentum, the 

interaction is suppressed, and the original primary continues to the time of its next collision. In 
case an interaction is Pauli allowed, the tracking of the primary ends, and the secondaries are 
treated like the primary. All their possible binary collisions with the residual nucleus are 
calculated, with the addition of decay in case of strong resonances. For resonance decay, the 
collision time is the time to the decay of the particle, sampled from the resonance’s lifetime. 
Herein the stochastic masses and decay widths are taken into account. All secondaries are 
tracked until they react, decay or leave the nucleus, or until the cascade stops due to the cut-off 
condition described above. 

A 3-dimensional model of the nucleus is constructed from A nucleons and Z protons with 
coordinates ri and momenta pi, with i = 1, 2, . . . ,A. Nucleon radii ri are selected randomly in the 
nucleus rest frame according to the nuclear density ρ(ri). For nuclei with A > 16, the Woods-
Saxon form of the nucleon density [22] is used,

nucleon potential, a minimum inter-nucleon distance of 0.8 fm is taken. The nucleus is assumed 
to be spherical and isotropic, i.e. each nucleon is placed using a random direction and the 
previously determined radius ri. 

The momenta pi of the nucleons are chosen randomly between 0 and the Fermi momentum 
Est(𝑟ë). The Fermi momentum, in the local Thomas-Fermi approximation as a function of the 
𝑝π
nuclear density ρ, is 

Est(𝑟ë) = ħ𝑐(3𝜋4𝜌(𝑟))@/,. (23)

The total vector sum of the nucleon momenta has to be zero, i.e. the nucleus must be constructed 
at rest. To achieve this, one nucleon is chosen to compensate the vector sum of the remaining

The effect of collective nuclear interaction upon participants is approximated by a time-invariant 
scalar optical potential, based on the properties of the target nucleus. For protons and neutrons 
the potential used is determined by the local Fermi momentum 𝑝π(𝑟)	as

where m is the mass of the neutron or the mass of the proton, respectively. For pions the potential

ρ(r) is the nucleon density distribution. The parameter b0 is the effective s-wave scattering

energy are occupied. Thus, collisions and decays for which any secondary nucleon has a 
momentum pi below the local Fermi momentum, i.e.

The basis of the description of the reactive part of the scattering amplitude are two-particle 
binary collisions, also with associated or direct resonance production, and decay. Based on the 
cross section described later, collisions will occur when the transverse distance dt of any

Experimental data and parameterizations thereof are used in the calculation of the total, inelastic 
and elastic cross-section wherever available.  

For the case of proton-proton (pp) and proton-neutron (pn) collisions, as well as π+- and π−-
nucleon collisions, experimental data and parameterizations are readily available as collected by 
the Particle Data Group (PDG) [25] for both elastic and inelastic collisions. The tabulation based 
on a sub-set of these data for √𝑠		below 3 GeV, and the PDG parameterization at higher energies, 
are applied. 

It also defines an upper limit of applicability of the model. Below 10 GeV kinetic energy, the 
resonance contributions considered are wholly sufficient to describe the total cross-section. 

Most of the cross-sections of individual channels involving meson-nucleon scattering can be 
modeled as resonance excitation in the s-channel.  

The initial states included in the model at present include all pion-nucleon scattering channels. 
The product resonances taken into account are the Delta-resonances with masses of 1232, 1600, 
1620, 1700, 1900, 1905, 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1950 MeV, and the excited nucleons with masses 
of 1440, 1520, 1535, 1650, 1675, 1680, 1700, 1710, 1720, 1900, 1990, 2090, 2190, 2220, and 
2250 MeV. 

In the resonance production in the t-channel, single and double resonance excitations in nucleon-
nucleon collisions are taken into account. 

The resonance production cross-sections are as much as possible based on parameterizations of 
experimental data for proton-proton scattering. The formula used for parameterizing the cross-
sections is motivated from the form of the exclusive production cross- section of the Δ1232 in 
proton-proton collisions:

For all other channels, the parameterizations were derived from these by adjusting the threshold 
behavior accordingly. Cross-sections for the reminder of the channels are derived from those 
described above, by applying detailed balance. Isospin invariance is assumed. The formalism 
used to apply detailed balance is

Angular distributions for elastic scattering of nucleons are taken as closely as possible from 
experimental data, i.e. from the result of a phase shift analysis. They are derived from differential 
cross-sections obtained from the SAID database, R. Arndt et al. [26].  

Angular distributions for final states other than nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering are calculated 
analytically, derived from the collision term of the in-medium relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-
Uhlenbeck equation [27] via scaling of the center-of-mass energy. The modular structure of 
GEANT4 allows the generation of single events with a known incident particle energy and any 
explicitly defined hadronic final-state generator. The kinematics of secondaries produced in the 
interaction are then analyzed and the resulting angular, momentum, energy, and baryon number 
spectra are stored in histograms. The energy-momentum balance can be controlled as well. The 
histograms are compared to published measurements of the differential and double differential 
dσ/dE cross sections, dσ/dE, dσ/dΩ, d2σ/dEdΩ, and the invariant cross-sections, Ed3σ/d3p. 

The range of Binary Cascade model applicability in nucleon nuclear reactions stretches from < 
100 MeV to about 10 GeV, allowing for a consistent calculation of the secondary hadron spectra 
in the low and intermediate energy domains. 

III. BERTINI CASCADE 

The INC model developed by Bertini [28–31] solves on the average the Boltzmann equation of 
this particle interaction problem. The Bertini nuclear model consists of a three-region 
approximation to the continuously changing density distribution of nuclear matter within nuclei. 
Relativistic kinematics is applied throughout the cascade and the cascade is stopped when all the 
particles which can escape the nucleus, have done so. The Pauli exclusion principle is taken into 
account and conformity with the energy conservation law is checked. Path lengths of nucleons in 
the nucleus are sampled according to the local density and free nucleon-nucleon cross-sections. 
Angles after collisions are sampled from experimental differential cross-sections. Intermediate 
energy nuclear reactions up to 10 GeV energy are treated for proton, neutron, pions, photon and 
nuclear isotopes. 

The necessary condition of validity of the INC model is 𝜆ò 𝑣 ≪ 𝜏D ≪ Δ𝑡
Broglie wavelength of the nucleons, 𝑣 is the average relative nucleon-nucleon velocity and Δt is 
the time interval between collisions. The physical foundation becomes approximate at energies 
less than about 200 MeV , and there needs to be supplemented with a pre-equilibrium model. 
Also, at energies higher than 5-10 GeV the INC picture breaks down. The basic steps of the INC 
model are summarized below.

The nucleons are assumed to have a Fermi gas momentum distribution. The Fermi energy is

If the target is Hydrogen (A = 1), a direct particle-particle collision is performed, and no nuclear 
modeling is used. 

If 1 < A < 4, a nuclei model consisting of one layer with a radius of 8.0 fm is created. 

For 4 < A < 11, a nuclei model is composed of three concentric spheres i = {1, 2, 3} with the

which depends on the density n/v of particles, and which is different for each particle and each 
region. The path lengths of nucleons in the nucleus are sampled according to the local density 
and free nucleon-nucleon cross-sections. The angles after collisions are sampled from 
experimental differential cross-sections. 

Thus, the free particle-particle cross-sections and region-dependent nucleon densities are used to 
select the path length for the projectile particle. The tabulated total reaction cross-sections are 
calculated by Letaw’s formulation [32–34]. For nucleon-nucleon cross-sections, 
parameterizations based on the experimental energy and isospin dependent data are used.  

For pions the INC cross-sections are provided to treat elastic collisions, and inelastic channels: 
π−n → π0n, π0p → π+n and π0n → π−p. Multiple particle production is also implemented. 

The S-wave pion absorption channels π+nn → pn, π+pn → pp, π0nn → X , π0pn → pn, π0pp → 
pp, π−nn→ X , π−pn → nn , and π−pp → pn are implemented. 

 
 
The Pauli exclusion principle forbids interactions where the products would be in occupied 
states. Following the assumption of a completely degenerate Fermi gas, the levels are filled from 
the lowest level. The minimum energy allowed for a collision product corresponds to the lowest 
unfilled level of system, which is the Fermi energy in the region. So, in practice, the Pauli 
exclusion principle is taken into account by accepting only secondary nucleons which have EN > 
EF . 

After INC, the residual excitation energy of the resulting nucleus is used as input for a non-
equilibrium model. The Geant4 cascade model implements the exciton model proposed by 
Griffin [8]. In this model nuclear states are characterized by the number of exited particles and 
holes (the exitons). INC collisions give rise to a sequence of states characterized by increasing 
exciton number, eventually leading to an equilibrated nucleus. For practical implementation of 
the exciton model we use level density parameters from [35] and the matrix elements from [36]. 
In the exciton model the possible selection rules for particle-hole configurations in the course of 
the cascade are: Δp = 0,±1; Δh = 0,±1; Δn = 0,±2, where p is the number of particles, h is number 
of holes, and n = p + h is the number of exitons. The cascade pre-equilibrium model uses target 
excitation data, and exciton configurations for neutrons and protons to produce the non-
equilibrium evaporation. The angular distribution is isotropic in the frame of rest of the exciton 
system. The parameterizations of the level density used are tabulated both with their A and Z 
dependence and including high temperature behavior. The smooth liquid high energy formula is 
used for the nuclear binding energy. 

Fermi break-up is allowed only in some extreme cases, i.e. for light nuclei (A < 12 and 3(A − Z) 
< Z < 6 ) 

and if Eexcitation > 3Ebinding.  A simple explosion model decays the nucleus into neutrons and 
protons and decreases exotic evaporation processes. The fission model is a phenomenological 
model using potential minimization. The binding energy parametrization is used and some 
features of the fission statistical model are incorporated as in [37]. 

The statistical theory for particle emission from exited nuclei remaining after INC was originally 
developed by Weisskopf [38]. This model assumes complete energy equilibration before particle 
emission, and re-equilibration of excitation energies between successive evaporation emissions. 
As a result, the angular distribution of emitted particles is isotropic. 

The emission of particles is computed until the excitation energy falls below the cutoff value. If a 
light nucleus is highly exited, the Fermi break-up model is executed. In addition, fission is 
performed when the fission channel is open. The main chain of evaporation is followed until 
Eexcitation falls below Ecutoff = 0.1 MeV. The evaporation model ends with a  γ emission chain, 
cutoff = 10−15 MeV. 
which is followed until Eexcitation < Eγ

Extensive benchmarking of the INC physics provided by Bertini cascade sub-models, exitons, 
pre-equilibrium state, nucleus explosion, fission, and evaporation has been made. The Geant4 

evaporation model for cascade implementation adapts the widely used computational method 
developed by Dostrowski [39, 40]. The model is validated up to 10 GeV incident energy and 
users from various fields have been using it successfully. 

To validate Bertini isotope production physics performance, extensive simulations on proton-
induced reactions in Pb and Au targets were performed with Geant4 [41]. The Bertini cascade 
model in Geant4 simulates the hadronic interactions of protons, neutrons and pions with 
surrounding materials. 

IV. CEM AND LAQGSM MODELS 

The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Monte-Carlo N-particle transport code MCNP6 
[42] uses by default the latest version of the cascade-exciton model (CEM), CEM03.03 [43–45], 
as its event generator to simulate reactions induced by nucleons, pions, and photons with 
energies up to 4.5 GeV and the Los Alamos version of the quark-gluon string model 
(LAQGSM), LAQGSM03.03 [45–47], to simulate such reactions at higher energies, as well as 
reactions induced by other elementary particles and by nuclei with energies up to ∼ 1 
TeV/nucleon. Details, examples of results, and useful references to different versions of CEM 
and LAQGSM can be found in [45]. 

The cascade-exciton model (CEM) [44] of nuclear reactions is based on the standard Dubna 
intranuclear cascade model [48, 49] and the modified exciton model (MEM) [50, 51]. The CEM 
code calculates nuclear reactions induced only by nucleons, pions, and photons. A detailed 
description of the initial version of the CEM can be found in [44], therefore we outline here only 
its basic assumptions. The CEM assumes that reactions occur in three stages. The first stage is 
the INC, in which primary particles can be re-scattered and produce secondary particles several 
times prior to absorption by, or escape from, the nucleus. All the cascade calculations are carried 
out in the three-dimensional geometry. The nuclear matter density ρ(r) is described by the Fermi 
distribution with two parameters taken from the analysis of electron-nucleus scattering, namely 

𝜌(𝑟) = 𝜌l(𝑟) + 𝜌å(𝑟) = 𝜌?{1 + 𝑒𝑥𝑝[(𝑟 − 𝑐) 𝑎⁄ ]}, (33) 

where c = 1.07A1/3 fm, A is the mass number of the target, and 𝑎 = 0.545 fm. For simplicity, the 
target nucleus is divided by concentric spheres into seven zones in which the nuclear density is 
considered to be constant. The energy spectrum of the target nucleons is estimated in the perfect 
Fermi-gas approximation with the local Fermi energy 𝑇π(𝑟) = ħ4[3𝜋4𝜌(𝑟)]4 ,⁄
(2⁄ 𝑚K), where 
mN is the nucleon mass. The inﬂuence of intranuclear nucleons on the incoming projectile is 
taken into account by adding to its laboratory kinetic energy the eﬀective real potential V, as well 
as by considering the Pauli principle which forbids a number of intranuclear collisions and 
eﬀectively increases the mean free path of cascade particles inside the target. For incident 
nucleons V≡ VN(r)=TF(r)+ϵ, where TF(r) is the corresponding Fermi energy and ϵ is the binding 

 
energy of the nucleons. For pions, CEM03.01 uses a square-well nuclear potential with the depth 
Vπ ≃ 25 MeV, independently of the nucleus and pion energy, as was done in the initial Dubna 
INC [48, 49]. 

The Pauli exclusion principle at the cascade stage of the reaction is handled by assuming that 
nucleons of the target occupy all the energy levels up to the Fermi energy. Each simulated elastic 
or inelastic interaction of the projectile (or of a cascade particle) with a nucleon of the target is 
considered forbidden if the “secondary” nucleons have energies smaller than the Fermi energy. If 
they do, the trajectory of the particle is traced further from the forbidden point and a new 
interaction point, a new partner and a new interaction mode are simulated for the traced particle, 
etc., until the Pauli principle is satisfied or the particle leaves the nucleus. 

If the residual nuclei after the INC have atomic numbers with A≤AFermi=12, CEM uses the Fermi 
break-up model to calculate their further disintegration instead of using the pre-equilibrium and 
evaporation models. Fermi break-up, which estimates the probabilities of various final states by 
calculating the approximate phase space available for each configuration, is much faster to 
calculate and gives results very similar to those from using the continuation of the more detailed 
models for lighter nuclei. 

An important ingredient of the CEM is the criterion for transition from the intranuclear cascade 
to the pre-equilibrium model. The cascade model uses a different criterion to decide when a 
primary particle is considered to have left the cascade (cutoff energy Tcut or cutoff time tcut). In 
CEM the effective local optical absorptive potential Wopt.mod.(r) is defined from the local 
interaction cross section of the particle, including Pauli blocking effects. This imaginary 
potential is compared to the one defined by the phenomenological global optical model 
Wopt.exp.(r). The degree of similarity or difference of these imaginary potentials is characterized 
by the parameter 

𝒫 = ôX𝑊klj.EkÅ. − 𝑊klj.xtl.\ 𝑊klj.xtl.

>

ô. 

When 𝒫 increases above an empirically chosen value, the particle leaves the cascade, and is then 
considered to be an exciton. CEM uses the fixed value 𝒫 = 0.3. 

When the cascade stage of a reaction is completed, CEM uses the coalescence model to create 
high-energy d, t, 3He, and 4He fragments by final-state interactions among emitted cascade 
nucleons outside of the target nucleus. The value of the momentum p of each cascade nucleon is 
calculated relativistically from its kinetic energy T. It is assumed that all the cascade nucleons 
having differences in their momenta smaller than pc and with the correct isotopic content form an 
appropriate composite particle. 

The coalescence model first checks all nucleons to form 2-nucleon pairs, if their momenta permit 
it. It then takes these 2-nucleon pairs and the single nucleons left and forms 4He, 3He, and/or 
tritium, if their momenta permit it. The extended coalescence model further takes these two-

nucleon pairs, tritium, 3He, and 4He to see if they can coalesce to form heavier clusters: 6He, 6Li, 
7Li or 7Be. All coalesced nucleons are removed from the distributions of nucleons so that atomic 
and mass numbers are conserved. 

The results show significant improvement in the production of heavy clusters in the whole 
energy range. However, too many alpha particles were lost (coalesced into heavy clusters); so 
pc(4He) was increased to compensate it. The new values for pc for the extended coalescence 
model are: 

𝑝D(𝑑) = 90	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ ; 

𝑝D(𝑡) = 𝑝DX 𝐻𝑒,

\ = 108	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ ; (34) 

𝑝DX 𝐻𝑒P

\ = 130	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ ; 

𝑝D(𝐿𝐹) = 175	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ . 

For 300 MeV < T < 1000 MeV they are: 

𝑝D(𝑑) = 150	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ ; 

𝑝D(𝑡) = 𝑝DX 𝐻𝑒,

\ = 175	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ ; (35) 

𝑝DX 𝐻𝑒P

\ = 205	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ ; 

𝑝D(𝐿𝐹) = 250	 𝑀𝑒𝑉 𝑐⁄ . 

The emission of the cascade particles determines the particle-hole conﬁguration, Z, A, and the 
excitation energy that is the starting point for the pre-equilibrium stage of the reaction. The 
subsequent relaxation of the nuclear excitation is treated in terms of an improved Modiﬁed 
Exciton Model (MEM) [50, 51] of pre-equilibrium decay, followed by the equilibrium 
evaporation/ﬁssion stage described using a modification of the generalized evaporation model 
(GEM) code GEM2 by Furihata [52]. The transition from the pre-equilibrium stage of a reaction 
to the third (evaporation) stage occurs when the probability of nuclear transitions changing the 
number of excitons n with ∆n = +2 becomes equal to the probability of transitions in the opposite 
direction, with ∆n = −2, i.e., when the exciton model predicts that equilibration has been 
established in the nucleus. 

Generally, all three components can contribute to experimentally measured particle spectra and 
other distributions. 

The Los Alamos version of the Quark-Gluon String Model (LAQGSM) [46, 47] is a further 
development of the Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) by Amelin, Gudima, and Toneev (see 
[55] and references therein) and is intended to describe both particle- and nucleus-induced 
reactions at energies up to about 1 TeV/nucleon. The basis of QGSM is the time-dependent 

version of the intranuclear-cascade model developed at Dubna, often referred in literature simply 
as the Dubna intranuclear Cascade Model (DCM) (see [53] and references therein). LAQGSM 
also describes nuclear reactions as three-stage processes: an INC, followed by pre-equilibrium 
emission of particles during the equilibration of the excited residual nuclei formed after the INC, 
followed by evaporation of particles from and/or fission of the compound nuclei. 

The DCM models interactions of fast cascade particles (“participants”) with nucleon spectators 
of both the target and projectile nuclei and includes as well interactions of two participants 
(cascade particles). It uses experimental particle+particle cross sections at energies below 4.5 
GeV/nucleon, or those calculated by the quark-gluon string model (QGSM) at higher energies 
(see, e.g., [54] and references therein) to simulate angular and energy distributions of cascade 
particles, and also considers the Pauli exclusion principle. 

When the cascade stage of a reaction is completed, QGSM uses the coalescence model described 
in [53] to “create” high-energy d, t, 3He, and 4He by final-state interactions among emitted 
cascade nucleons outside of the colliding nuclei. After calculating the coalescence stage of a 
reaction, QGSM moves to the description of the last slow stages of the interaction, namely to 
pre-equilibrium decay and evaporation, with a possible competition of fission using the standard 
version of CEM [44]. If the residual nuclei have atomic numbers A ≤ 12, QGSM uses the Fermi 
break-up model to calculate their further disintegration instead of using the pre-equilibrium and 
evaporation models. LAQGSM differs from QGSM by replacing the pre-equilibrium and 
evaporation parts of QGSM described according to the standard CEM [44] with the new physics 
from CEM2k [56, 57] and has a number of improvements and refinements in the cascade and 
Fermi break-up models. A detailed description of LAQGSM and further references can be found 
in [46, 47]. The coalescence model was extended to be able to produce light fragments up to 7Be 
in CEM and up to 12C in LAQGSM. 

The pre-equilibrium interaction stage of nuclear reactions is considered by the current CEM and 
LAQGSM in the framework of the latest version of MEM [50, 51]. At the pre-equilibrium stage 
of a reaction, CEM03.03 and LAQGSM03.03 take into account all possible nuclear transitions 
changing the number of excitons n with ∆n = +2, -2, and 0, as well as all possible multiple 
subsequent emissions of n, p, d, t, 3He, and 4He. The corresponding system of master equations 
describing the behavior of a nucleus at the pre-equilibrium stage is solved by the Monte-Carlo 
method [44]. In [58], the modified exciton model MEM was extended to include the possibility 
of emitting heavy clusters, with A > 4, up to 28Mg (66 types of particles and LF). For incident 
energies below about 200 MeV, Kalbach has developed a phenomenological systematics for pr-
eequilibrium particle angular distributions by fitting available measured spectra of nucleons and 
complex particles [59]. As the Kalbach systematics are based on measured spectra, they describe 
very well the double-differential spectra of pre-equilibrium particles and generally provide a 
better agreement of calculated pre-equilibrium complex-particle spectra with experimental data. 

The inverse cross sections used by these models at the pre-equilibrium stage (and at the 
evaporation/fission-stage) have a significant impact on the calculated particle width, and affect 
greatly the final results and the-accuracy of the MCNP6, MCNPX [60] and MARS15 [61-63]-
transport codes, which use these models as their event-generators. This is why it is necessary to 
use as good as possible approximations for the inverse cross sections in the extended models. 

The unmodified codes use the inverse cross sections σinv from Dostrovsky’s formulas [39, 40] for 
all emitted nucleons and complex particles (d, t, 3He, and 4He) is not very suitable for emission 
of fragments heavier than 4He. Better total-reaction-cross-section models that can be used as an 
estimate for inverse cross sections are available today, especially such as the NASA model [64], 
the approximations by Barashenkov and Polanski [65], and those by Kalbach [66]. A quite 
complete list of references on modern total-reaction-cross-section models, as well as on recent 
publications where these models are compared with each other and with available experimental 
data can be found in [67]. 

An extensive comparison of the systematics for total reaction (inverse) cross sections showed 
that the NASA approach is better, in general, than the other available models. This is why we 
implemented the NASA inverse cross sections into the MEM to be used at the pre-equilibrium 
stage of reactions. 

The NASA approximation, as described by Eq. (36,) attempts to simulate several quantum-
mechanical effects, such as the optical potential for neutrons (with the parameter Xm) and 
collective effects like Pauli blocking (through the quantity δT).

where r0, AP , AT , δT , Rc, BT , Tcm, and Xm are, respectively, the constant used to calculate the 
radii of nuclei, the mass number of the projectile nucleus, the mass number of the target nucleus, 
the energy-dependent parameter, the system-dependent Coulomb multiplier, the energy-
dependent Coulomb barrier, the colliding system center of-momentum energy, and the optical 
model multiplier used for neutron-induced reactions. The calculation of inverse cross sections at 
the pre-equilibrium stage of reactions was improved with a new hybrid NASA-Kalbach 
approach, instead of the old Dostrovsky model used previously. This extended version of the 
MEM is implemented into the upgraded CEM, labeled CEM03.03F, as well as into the new 
LAQGSM03.03F. 

After the INC, LAQGSM uses the same pre-equilibrium, coalescence, Fermi break-up, and 
evaporation/fission models as described above for CEM. 

The improved CEM, LAQGSM, was implemented as event generator into MCNP6 and allow 
one to describe particle- and nucleus-induced reactions and provide a good agreement with 

available experimental data. They have a good predictive power for various reactions and can be 
used as reliable tools in scientific and applied research. 

Emission of energetic heavy clusters heavier than 4He from nuclear reactions play a critical role 
in several applications, including electronics performance in space, human radiation dosages in 
space or other extreme radiation environments, proton and hadron therapy in medical physics, 
accelerator and shielding applications, and so on. The CEM and LAQGSM event generators in 
MCNP6 describe quite well the spectra of fragments with sizes up to 4He in a broad range of 
target masses and incident energies (up to ∼ 5 GeV for CEM and up to ∼ 1 TeV/A for 
LAQGSM). 

V. Numerical simulation of extended heavy targets irradiated by proton and deuteron beams. 
Comparison of models and codes 

Thorough understanding of the mechanisms and approaches used in different simulation models 
is important for obtaining reliable numerical data on irradiation of big heavy targets by 
accelerated proton and ion beams. Such experiments performed at the JINR accelerator facilities 
with Quinta and BURAN targets contribute to the research aimed at advanced schemes of 
nuclear power production with accelerated particle beams. Of course, experimental studies of 
such scale and complexity should be preceded by comprehensive numerical study. 

Below we give the results of simulation of extended heavy targets irradiated by proton and 
deuteron beams. The focus of comparison of different applied models is neutron production and 
absorption in the target material depending on the target dimensions. 

We consider targets from uranium-238 with the following dimensions: a radius of 15 cm, a 
length of 40 cm; a radius of 30 cm, a length of 80 cm; and a radius of 60 cm, a length of 160 cm. 

The following accelerated beams are considered: protons with an energy of 0.66 GeV, 1 GeV, 2 
GeV, 4 GeV, and deuterons with an energy of 0.66 GeV/nucleon, 1 GeV/nucleon, 2 
GeV/nucleon, 4 GeV/nucleon. 

Among the most important parameters characterizing beam interaction with fissionable materials 
is neutron production rate per beam particle. Neutron flux leaving the target is also important, as 
it provides information on the energy accumulated in the target due to ion-target interaction. 

Tables 1-12 below summarize the results of calculations via several models for the beam and 
target parameters given above.

It can be seen that the difference between the predictions by different codes and models is, on 
average, within 30%, although, in certain cases it may be almost twice as high. This 
demonstrates the difficulties encountered in simulation of beam-matter interaction, especially in 
bulk targets and proves that in order to obtain reliable numerical picture of interaction, codes 
should be verified to experimental data for particular experimental conditions.  

An important and least studied part of the neutron spectrum from large extended targets is that of 
fast neutrons. Below we give the numerical results obtained with different models on production 
and escape of fast neutrons for the target parameters corresponding to those of BURAN target: a 
radius of 60 cm and a length of 160 cm.

It can be seen from Table 13 that, on average, the agreement of the considered models is not bad. 
However, the discrepancy increases with increasing energy of the incident beam. Already for a 
proton energy of 1 GeV the model predictions may differ by as much as 40%, this discrepancy 

 
 
 
 
 
increasing to 43% for a 2 GeV proton beam and 50% for a 4 GeV proton beam. It should be 
noted that considered beam energies are of interest from the point of view of development of 
new concepts of nuclear power production with the aid of accelerated ion beams, which explains 
utmost importance of both theoretical and experimental study of these processes. Of course, 
neutron production and escape depends strongly on the target parameters: material and 
dimensions. Below we illustrate the effect of the target dimensions on these processes. 

VI. Effect of target dimensions on neutron production and capture in a heavy bulk target 
irradiated by accelerated proton and deuteron beams 

Irradiation of heavy extended targets by light ion beams is of substantial interest for development 
of the new concept of power production aided by an accelerator [70, 71] and for research toward 
transmutation of radioactive waste. Note that the neutron spectrum, especially the hard part, is of 
extreme importance in ADS nuclear power production. Although the fraction of fast neutrons is 
rather small, they carry a substantial part of the energy. Therefore, it is important that the 
geometry of the target is such that the produced fast neutrons do not leave its volume, carrying 
away a noticeable fraction of energy. Below, we estimate the appropriate target length and 
radius. 

The numerical experiment on irradiation of bulk heavy targets by proton and deuteron beams is 
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Experimental studies in this field are carried out at JINR. The 
comparison of calculations and measured data will be the topic of another paper. 

The integrated number of fissions and captures per projectile, for the targets with a radius of 60 
cm and different lengths is shown in Fig. 1, for 0.66 GeV proton, and 0.66, 1, 2 and 4 AGeV 
deuteron beams.

It can be seen from Fig. 1 that both the number of fissions and the number of captures per one 
beam particle reach a plateau rather promptly, already for a target length of about 40 cm, for all 
considered beam types and energies. 

The integrated number of fissions and captures per projectile, for the target with a length of 160 
cm and different radii is shown in Fig. 2, for 0.66 GeV proton, and 0.66, 1, 2 and 4 AGeV

Fig. 2. Fissions and captures in the long irradiated target depending on the target radius. 

It can be seen from Fig. 2 that, similar to the case of the target length variation, the number of 
fissions and neutron captures promptly reach a plateau with increasing target radius. The radius 
equal to 30 cm is roughly sufficient for it. 

This testifies that a bulk target, being irradiated by proton and deuteron beams in a wide energy 
range, demonstrates a "saturation" mode when the number of fissions and captures per beam 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
particle reach a stationary value and remain constant with further growth of the target 
dimensions. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The paper presented the comparative analysis of the basic cascade models of nuclear interactions 
applied in software for simulation of beam-target collisions: Liege intranuclear cascade, binary 
cascade, Bertini cascade, cascade exciton model and  quark-gluon string model. The main 
physics approximations underlying these models were discussed. 

The simulation of bulk heavy targets irradiated by accelerated proton and deuteron beams of 
energies from 0.66 GeV/nucleon to 4 GeV/nucleon was performed using five different software 
packages: SHIELD, GEANT4, MCNP6 and MARS15. The neutron production and escape from 
238U targets of three sizes: a radius of 15 cm and a length of 40 cm, a radius of 30 cm and a 
length of 80 cm, and a radius of 60 cm and a length of 160 cm were analyzed. The beam and 
target parameters were chosen close to those studied experimentally at the accelerator complex 
of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. 

It was shown that, on the whole, the agreement between the models and codes is within 30% and 
better, worsening in some cases to 50% discrepancy. The highest discrepancy was observed for 
the high energy part of the neutron spectrum, which is of importance in design of novel 
accelerator-aided nuclear power production facilities and nuclear waste transmutation issues. 
This indicates the need in further theoretical and experimental studies of inelastic interactions 
with production of fast neutrons and interaction of these neutrons with bulk heavy materials. The 
comparison of calculations and experimental data obtained at JINR will be the subject of another 
paper.
