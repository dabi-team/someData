The new era of gravitational wave astronomy truly began on September 14, 2015 with the
detection of GW150914, the sensational ﬁrst direct observation of gravitational waves
from the inspiral and merger of two black holes by the two Advanced LIGO detectors.
In the subsequent ﬁrst three observing runs of the LIGO/Virgo network, gravitational
waves from ∼ 50 compact binary mergers have been announced, with more results to
come. The events have mostly been produced by binary black holes, but two binary
neutron star mergers have so far been observed, as well as the mergers of two neutron
star - black hole systems. Furthermore, gravitational waves emitted by core-collapse
supernovae, pulsars and the stochastic gravitational wave background are within the
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA sensitivity band and are likely to be observed in future obser-
vation runs. Beyond signal detection, a major challenge has been the development of
statistical and computational methodology for estimating the physical waveform param-
eters and quantifying their uncertainties in order to accurately characterise the emitting
system. These methods depend on the sources of the gravitational waves and the grav-
itational waveform model that is used. This article reviews the main waveform models
and parameter estimation methods used to extract physical parameters from gravita-
tional wave signals detected to date by LIGO and Virgo and from those expected to be
observed in the future, which will include KAGRA, and how these methods interface
with various aspects of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA science. Also presented are the statistical
methods used by LIGO and Virgo to estimate detector noise, test general relativity, and
draw conclusions about the rates of compact binary mergers in the universe. Further-
more, a summary of major publicly available gravitational wave parameter estimation
software packages is given.

While we can see the universe with electromagnetic
radiations, we can now also listen to the universe with
gravitational waves. After decades of work, Advanced
LIGO (Aasi et al., 2015a) and Advanced Virgo (Acer-
nese et al., 2015) have made direct detections (Abbott
et al., 2019b, 2021d,e). The detections in and of them-
selves were the conﬁrmation of the prediction made by
Albert Einstein a century before (Einstein, 1916b, 1918)
as a consequence of general relativity (Einstein, 1916a).
The direct detection of gravitational waves was a fun-

should be noted that the existence of gravitational waves
was already established by the observation of the decay of
the orbit of a binary neutron star system, exactly at the
rate predicted by general relativity (Taylor and Weisberg,
1982; Taylor and Weisberg, 1989; Weisberg and Huang,
2016; Weisberg et al., 2010). Gravitational waves are a
new means to observe the universe, and are providing im-
portant astrophysical and cosmological information, with
much more to come with future observations.

Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo have now com-
pleted three observational runs. The ﬁrst observing run,
O1, occurred from September 12, 2015 until January
19, 2016, and involved only Advanced LIGO. Advanced
LIGO’s second observing run, O2, started on November
30, 2016, then went until August 25, 2017. On August
1, 2017, Advanced Virgo formally joined O2, although it
was acquiring some engineering data leading up to that
date. Advanced Virgo also observed in O2 up until Au-
gust 25, 2017, thereby providing the ﬁrst time three de-
tectors were used to search for gravitational waves. The

third observing run, O3, commenced on April 1, 2019,
and ended on March 27, 2020.

The initial observation of gravitational waves was
made by the two Advanced LIGO detectors on Septem-
ber 14, 2015 (Abbott et al., 2016d). The signal de-
tected at the LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) and
the LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) can be seen in
Fig. 1. Parameter estimation methods were then em-
ployed on this observed signal, in this case, the LALInfer-
ence package of the LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL) soft-
ware suite (Veitch et al., 2015), which will be described
below. The physical parameters estimated for this signal
include the masses, spins, luminosity distance, sky po-
sition, and other parameters which will be described in
more detail below. It was from the parameter estimation
results that the initial component masses m1 = 36+5
(cid:12)
−
and m2 = 29+4
of the system in its source frame
−
corresponding to GW150914 were obtained. The param-
eter estimation routines generated bivariate and univari-
ate posterior distributions for these masses which are dis-
played in Fig. 2. The signal reconstruction appearing in
Fig. 1 is also a consequence of the parameter estimation.
From the observation that there are two apparent point
masses of 36M
one can declare that LIGO
(cid:12)
has observed black holes, another important consequence
of Einstein’s theory of general relativity (Kerr, 1963; Op-
penheimer and Snyder, 1939; Schwarzschild, 1916). The
observation of stellar mass black holes around 30M
also
had important astrophysical implications (Abbott et al.,
2016a). Presented in Fig. 3 is a timeline of important
events pertaining to gravitational waves.

The importance of parameter estimation was also dra-
matically displayed in association with GW170817 (Ab-
bott et al., 2017f), observed by Advanced LIGO and Ad-
vanced Virgo, and produced by the merger of a binary
neutron star system. This observation was the birth of
gravitational wave multi-messenger astronomy.
In ad-
dition to the gravitational wave signal, a gamma ray
burst was observed 1.7 s after the merger time (Abbott
et al., 2017d). The gravitational wave signal gave an
estimate of the sky positon and distance to the source
(see Fig. 4); this was consistent with the sky position
that could be inferred from the gamma ray signals de-
tected by Fermi-GBM (Goldstein et al., 2017) and IN-
TEGRAL (Savchenko et al., 2017). The localization of
the emission of the signal allowed for the identiﬁcation of
the source, and then the discovery of the kilonova (Ab-
bott et al., 2017f; Coulter et al., 2017). This was a
tremendously important event, and the ability to to use
parameter estimation to ﬁnd the source of GW170817
led to numerous signiﬁcant observations (Abbott et al.,
2017). It also led to important fundamental physics re-
sults, such as an independent measurement of the Hubble
constant (Abbott et al., 2017a), and the demonstration
that the speed of gravity is the same as the speed of

scribed below). Grey traces represent the data. From Abbott

The goal of this review will be to summarize the state
of parameter estimation for gravitational wave observa-
tions. The review will be dedicated to applications from
the ground based detectors (Advanced LIGO, Advanced
Virgo, KAGRA (Akutsu et al., 2017, 2019; Aso et al.,
2013)). There are numerous studies addressing param-
eter estimation for the Laser Interferometer Space An-
tenna (LISA) (Amaro-Seoane et al., 2017; Babak, 2017),
and pulsar timing (Alam et al., 2021a,b; Hobbs and Dai,
2017). For this review we address only the ground based
detector results, and encourage the reader to also ex-
plore the rich parameter estimation literature for LISA
and pulsar timing. In their ﬁrst three observation runs
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo have reported the
50 compact
observations of gravitational waves from
binary mergers (Abbott et al., 2019b, 2021d). The re-
sults from the second half of the third observing run are
still forthcoming. Parameter estimation routines applied
to these signals have produced results in fundamental
physics, astrophysics and cosmology. We present a re-
view of these methods and results.

II. HISTORY

We present here a review of the history of parame-
ter estimation for gravitational waves. Early papers that

tational wave signal by Advanced LIGO, GW150914 (Abbott

els are IMRPhenom (blue), and EOBNR (red), with the com-
bined posterior probability distributions (black). The 50%

addressed the inverse problem of estimating the parame-
ters of gravitational wave signals from ground-based laser
interferometric measurements were predominantly us-
ing maximum-likelihood (ML) based approaches. Davis
(1989) gave a general overview of the statistical theory of
signal detection including the classical theory of hypoth-
esis testing, ML estimation of unknown parameters, non-
linear ﬁltering in signal detection and pre-whitening ﬁl-
ters to handle correlated noise. G¨ursel and Tinto (1989)
developed a method to estimate the source direction and
the amplitudes of gravitational wave burst signals from
observations of three detectors assuming white noise us-
ing a least squares approach and optimal ﬁltering with-
out any explicit model for the GW waveform. Echev-
erria (1989) was the ﬁrst to not only estimate the mass
and angular momentum of a perturbed Kerr black hole
from the emitted gravitational waves but to describe a
method for determining the uncertainty in the parame-
ter estimates. The method is based on Wiener optimal
ﬁltering and determining the parameters that maximize
the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the results were valid
only for a suﬃciently large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and provided no guidance for estimating the amplitude
of the signal. ML estimation was used by Kr´olak et al.

FIG. 3 Presented here is a timeline of signiﬁcant events in the history of gravitational waves. These include Einstein’s
papers on gravitational waves (Einstein, 1916b, 1918), predictions of gravitational collapse of stars and the creation of neutron
stars (Oppenheimer and Snyder, 1939; Oppenheimer and Volkoﬀ, 1939), and a general relativistic solution for spinning masses
(such as black holes) (Kerr, 1963). The famous Chapel Hill conference in 1957 led to the acceptance by the physics community
that gravitational waves truly exist (Bergmann, 1957). The ﬁrst pulsar was discovered in 1967 (Hewish et al., 1968), followed
by the binary pulsar in 1967 (Hulse and Taylor, 1975), and the observation of the orbital decay of the binary pulsar by the
emission of gravitational waves (Taylor and Weisberg, 1982). Construction for LIGO began in 1994, and 1996 for Virgo. Initial
LIGO and Virgo made observations from 2002 to 2010, but with no detections. The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
observing runs to date at O1, O2 and O3, while future observing runs O4 and O5 will also include KAGRA. The LISA mission
is presently predicted to begin in 2034 (Amaro-Seoane et al., 2017), while the third generation detector, such as Einstein
Telescope (Punturo et al., 2010) and Cosmic Explorer (Reitze et al., 2019), should start observations in the 2030s.

and chirp mass of compact binary coalescing systems.
The chirp mass is deﬁned as

and it is the mass parameter that describes the evolution
of a binary system as its orbit decays via gravitational
wave emission.
In Sec. V a more complete description
is given. Jaranowski and Krolak (1994) extended the
ML approach to data from three detectors to estimate
the source direction and the strain amplitudes. Cutler
and Flanagan (1994) determined the accuracy of ML es-
timates of the masses, spins, and the distance to earth for
gravitational waves of binary inspiralling systems using
lowest order Newtonian waveforms. They gave an exam-
ple using the Markovi´c approximation (Markovi´c, 1993)
that there is no uncertainty of the location in the sky
of the binary. This reduced the unknown parameters of
the gravitational waveform to the distance to the binary,
the cosine of the inclination angle to the line of sight,
the polarization angle of the gravitational wave and the
phase at collision time. They expanded their analysis to
include post-Newtonian eﬀects on parameter estimates.
Even though the development of inverse probability
and Bayes’ theorem by Thomas Bayes and Pierre-Simon
Laplace dates back to the eighteenth century and having
physicists Sir Harold Jeﬀreys and Edwin Jaynes as strong
proponents in the twentieth century, Bayesian ideas in
astronomy did not appear until the late 1970s in the
ﬁeld of image restoration (Gull and Daniell, 1978). The
methodology was focused on the principle of maximum
entropy, ﬁnding a point estimate based on maximizing
an entropy-based prior subject to some likelihood-based

constraint (Hilbe and Loredo, 2013). This still fell short
of a proper Bayesian approach using all of the posterior
distribution and marginalization to determine point es-
timates of parameters and their uncertainties. The use
of Bayesian inference in astronomy as well as most other
disciplines was hindered by the diﬃculty of computing
the posterior distribution for problems with a large num-
ber of parameters. Computing the joint posterior distri-
bution using Bayes’ theorem required high-dimensional
integration to evaluate the normalization constant, and
ﬁnding the marginal posterior distribution of each indi-
vidual parameter. As numerical integration is only fea-
sible for dimensions up to
5, Laplace approximation
≈
(Gelman et al., 2014) works well only for unimodal and
symmetric posteriors, and ordinary simulation methods
based on independent random draws such as importance
sampling (Gelman et al., 2014) are only eﬃcient in low
dimensions, the progress of Bayesian inference was ulti-
mately linked to progress in computational solutions to
high-dimensional integration problems. One such solu-
tion already came with the development of the Metropo-
lis algorithm by Metropolis et al. (1953) and its exten-
sions, the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm (Hast-
ings, 1970) and a modiﬁcation by Barker (1965).
In-
stead of generating independent samples from the pos-
terior distribution, Metropolis came up with the idea of
generating dependent samples from an ergodic Markov
chain, constructed such that the posterior distribution
is its stationary distribution. However, its huge impor-
tance for Bayesian posterior computations remained un-
noticed until the seminal paper by Geman and Geman
(1984) that applied the MH algorithm to the problem
of image restoration. This paper marked the turning
point as it garnered huge interest not only from com-

5

ence and outlined its promise for astrophysics. Gregory
and Loredo (1992) had advocated strongly for a Bayesian
approach to statistical inference in astrophysical prob-
lems. The paper by Finn (1992) laid out a Bayesian strat-
egy for parameter estimation, using the posterior mode as
a point estimate and normal approximation to determine
a credible interval. Finn and Chernoﬀ (1993) explored
gravitational waves of binary inspirals observed by a sin-
gle detector, using a quadrupole waveform approximation
characterised by four parameters: amplitude, chirp mass,
arrival time and phase, again using the normal approxi-
mation for posterior computation. Finn (1997) described
the diﬀerence between the traditional frequentist and
Bayesian approach to data analysis and pointed out the
importance of Bayesian parameter estimation for gravita-
tional waves. The ﬁrst paper to show how computational
diﬃculties in computing the Bayesian posterior distribu-
tion of gravitational wave parameters can be overcome
by the sampling-based approach of MCMC was Chris-

mance of the Gibbs sampler in the same four-parameter
setup as Cutler and Flanagan (1994). The MCMC-based
approach to posterior computation was rapidly taken up
by the LSC and applied to gravitational waves from pul-
sars (Christensen et al., 2004b; Clark et al., 2007; Dupuis
and Woan, 2005; Umst¨atter et al., 2004), rotating core-
collapse supernovae (Edwards et al., 2014; Logue et al.,
2012; R¨over et al., 2009), and observations from the
planned space-based observatory LISA (Ali et al., 2012;
Cornish and Crowder, 2005; Cornish and Porter, 2007;
Crowder and Cornish, 2007; Gair et al., 2010; Umst¨atter
et al., 2005a,b). For binary inspirals, increasingly so-
phisticated MCMC techniques were developed that took
more and more accurate waveform approximations into
account with growing number of parameters (Aasi et al.,
2013; Christensen et al., 2004a; Christensen and Meyer,
2001; Pai et al., 2001; R¨over et al., 2006, 2007a; van der
Sluys et al., 2008a,b). These were further developed and
ﬁnally integrated into the LALInference adaptive MCMC
routine that is in place today to estimate the 15 param-
eters describing the coalescence of two compact spinning
binaries (Veitch et al., 2015). Skilling (2006) developed
nested sampling as an algorithm to approximate marginal
likelihoods, which, as a by-product, also generates sam-
ples from the posterior distribution. Nested sampling
simulates from the prior, conditional on having a like-
lihood value above a threshold.
In many applications,
importance sampling or MCMC algorithms are required
to generate these internal samples. Veitch and Vecchio
(2010) introduced nested sampling for parameter estima-
tion of gravitational waves. Nested sampling has been
integrated in LALInference and together with the adap-
tive MCMC is routinely employed for parameter estima-
tion and evidence calculation in LIGO. Both MCMC and
nested sampling were used to estimate the parameters of
the very ﬁrst gravitational wave signal GW150914 ob-

tance for the source of GW170817 using the data from the
two Advanced LIGO detectors and the Advanced Virgo de-
tector. A rapid parameter estimation routine (Singer and
Price, 2016) using just the data from the two LIGO detectors
(light blue contours) constrains the source sky location to
190 deg2, while with the data from Virgo included (dark blue
contours) the location uncertainty is reduced to 31 deg2. The
oﬄine parameter estimation analysis of Veitch et al. (2015)
further reduces the sky location uncertainty to 28 deg2 (green

tifying the location of the galaxy NGC 4993, where the source

puter scientists but also statisticians. More or less at the
same time, statisticians had simultaneously developed
the Gibbs sampler, based on the idea of generating a sam-
ple from a multivariate distribution by generating repeat-
edly over cycles of full conditional distributions (Tanner
and Wong, 1987). The Gibbs sampler was later shown
to be a special case of the MH algorithm, for a proof
see e.g. Chapter 11.5 of Gelman et al. (2014). The pa-
pers by Gelfand and Smith (1990) and Gilks et al. (1996)
laid out the foundations of simulation-based Bayesian
posterior computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. Coupled with this algorithmic break-
through, the 1990s also saw a continuous improvement
in hardware and computing power. This combination
triggered revolutionary advances in Bayesian computa-
tion via MCMC. For a detailed review of the history of
MCMC, see Hitchcock (2003). Thus, it was in the mid
to late 1990s that Bayesian computations became compu-
tationally feasible – just at the time the LIGO Scientiﬁc
Collaboration (LSC) was established in 1997 and interest
in the development of parameter estimation of signals to
be observed by LIGO and Virgo was growing.

In 1992, Loredo (1992) had already clearly contrasted
the Bayesian and frequentist approach to statistical infer-

served by LIGO, yielding consistent sets of parameter
estimates (Abbott et al., 2016e).

The importance that Bayesian parameter estimation
played in describing the physics associated with the ﬁrst
direct observation of gravitational waves with GW190514
is summarized in Meyer and Christensen (2016) and
Meyer et al. (2020). For the ﬁrst gravitational wave mul-
timessenger event, GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017f), pa-
rameter estimation provided an estimation of the source
position which then led to ﬁnding the optical counter-
part (Coulter et al., 2017), observations and studies of a
kilonova (Metzger, 2020), estimation of neutron star ra-
dius and tidal deformability (Abbott et al., 2018a, 2019a;
Coughlin et al., 2019), a speed of gravity limit (Ab-
bott et al., 2017d), a new estimation of the Hubble con-
stant (Abbott et al., 2017a), tests of general relativ-
ity (Abbott et al., 2019e), and much more. Now with
50 gravitational wave signal observed from compact

III. METHODS

We will brieﬂy review the general Bayesian approach to
statistical inference before describing the computational
methods used for calculating the posterior distribution of
gravitational wave parameters. For comprehensive treat-
ments of Bayesian inference, the reader is referred to
(Feigelson, 2012; Gamerman, 2006; Gelman et al., 2014;
Gregory, 2005; Jaynes, 2003).

is completely uncontroversial when applied for instance
to medical diagnostic testing where A might be the event
that a patient has a certain disease, Ac its complement,
i.e., that a patient does not have the disease, and B the
event that a diagnostic test for that disease returns a
positive result. It is purely based on probability theory
and the deﬁnitions of conditional and marginal probabil-
ities. The conditional probability of P(B
A) refers to the
likelihood and P(A) to the prior probability of A. Bayes’
theorem gives us a formula to update a prior probability
to the posterior probability P(A
B) after observing B. Its
|
application to the scenario where A are unknown param-
eters of a statistical model and B the observed data has
been the cause for seemingly unresolvable disputes be-
tween frequentists and Bayesians. Whereas frequentist
argue that unknown parameters are ﬁxed quantities and
thus cannot have a probability distribution, Bayesians

aim to quantify the uncertainty about unknown param-
eters using probability and thus treat them as random
quantities. Denoting observations by d = (d1, . . . , dn)
and unknown parameters by θ = (θ1, . . . , θp), the uncer-
tainty about the values of θ before observing the data is
expressed by the prior probability density function π(θ).

parameters. Bayes’ theorem in this context gives the

The denominator Z, also called the marginal likelihood,
evidence, or the prior predictive distribution, does not
depend on θ and is therefore merely a normalization
constant as far as the posterior distribution of θ is con-
cerned. It turns out that for many sampling-based tech-
niques, this normalization constant is not needed, there-
fore the posterior distribution is often written just as
proportional to prior times likelihood. The normalization
constant is important, though, for model comparison and
is an integral part of the Bayes factor, see III.C. Calcu-
lating the marginal posterior distribution of one of the
parameters requires integrating the joint posterior over
1 parameters. Similarly, calculating
the remaining p
the posterior mean or variance requires a further inte-
gration. Thus, the main diﬃculty in Bayesian posterior
computation when the dimension of the parameter space
is large, lies in solving high-dimensional integration prob-
lems. These integration problems can be solved analyti-
cally only for conjugate priors, by numerical integration
only in low dimensions, using Gaussian approximations
for unimodal and symmetric posteriors but, in general,
require simulation-based computational techniques such
as MCMC or nested sampling as described in more detail
below.

The noise term combines a variety of noise sources such
as quantum, seismic, and thermal noise and is assumed to
be mean zero, wide sense stationary and Gaussian with
power spectral density (PSD) S(k). The PSD is given by
the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function γ(k),
i.e., S(k)(f ) = (cid:80)∞(cid:96)=
i(cid:96)f and uniquely char-

For the moment, we also assume that S(k) is known. In
Sections IV.A and IV.B we will explain statistical meth-
ods for estimating the spectral density for a noise-only

tral density and gravitational wave signal parameters, re-
spectively. The strain signal h(k)(t

Virgo to 4096 Hz, band-pass ﬁltered as the LIGO and
Virgo detectors are sensitive and calibrated only in the
frequency bands of 10 Hz to 5 kHz for LIGO and 10 Hz
to 8 kHz for Virgo, and notch ﬁltered around known in-
strumental noise frequencies (Abbott et al., 2021k; Co-
vas et al., 2018). Code for these pre-processing steps is
included in the LAL library (LIGO Scientiﬁc Collabora-
tion, 2018). The exact form of the gravitational waveform

model h+,

focus on binary inspiral signals for which the parame-
ter vector θ consists of 15 individual parameters with
their prior π(θ) and describe their gravitational wave-
forms in Section V. Gravitational waveform models for
other sources such as pulsars, core collapse supernovae
and the stochastic gravitational wave background will be
presented in Section IX.

For parameter estimation of ringdown-only signals,
namely after two compact objects merge and the newly
formed black hole oscillates and emits gravitational waves
until it comes to equilibrium as a Kerr black hole, the
time-domain formulation of the likelihood (Eq. 4) is di-
rectly used (Carullo et al., 2019; Isi et al., 2019b) to avoid
the contribution of spurious frequency contributions from
the pre-merger phase. However in general, making use of
the Wiener-Khinchin theorem (Wiener, 1964), the like-
lihood is usually speciﬁed in the frequency domain by
the assumption of stationary Gaussian errors with known

as the Whittle likelihood and provides an approxima-
tion to the exact Gaussian likelihood (Contreras-Crist´an

ture given by Σ(k) = (cid:0)γ(k)(i

(cid:82) π
1. But it also pro-
−
vides a valid approximation to non-Gaussian likelihoods
(Tang et al., 2021). The Whittle likelihood is thus an
approximation in two respects: the ﬁrst approximation
takes place when one uses a Gaussian likelihood to ap-
proximate the potentially non-Gaussian likelihood of the
observations; the second approximation stems from re-
placing the quadratic form corresponding to the obser-
vations in the exponent of the time-domain Gaussian
likelihood with a frequency domain term by the sum of
( ˜d(k)(fj)
˜h(k)(fj))2/S(k)(fj). The Whittle likelihood
approximation therefore facilitates the likelihood evalu-
ations by avoiding matrix inversions of large covariance
matrices. Before going into more detail about speciﬁc
waveforms and prior distributions, the next subsections
describe simulation-based methods to compute the pos-
terior distribution of gravitational waveform parameters.
These assume the PSD to be known and ﬁxed for the
purpose of parameter estimation. Section IV will review
techniques for spectral density estimation.

A. Markov Chain Monte Carlo

The well-known Monte Carlo technique of rejection
sampling (Rubinstein, 1981) can be regarded as a pre-
cursor of MCMC and the Metropolis algorithm is easily
understood as a generalization.

To sample from a target probability density function
p(θ
d), rejection sampling generates a candidate θ∗
∼
|
q(θ) from a proposal probability density function q(θ)
M q(θ) for all
which majorizes the target, i.e., p(θ

d)
|

≤

θ and M > 0. Then it accepts θ∗ with probability

α =

p(θ∗
d)
|
M q(θ∗)

and otherwise rejects θ∗ and draws a new candidate. It
can be shown that the acceptance probability is 1/M , so
the rejection method is eﬃcient, if M is close to 1, i.e.,
q(.) close to p(.). Note that the normalization constant
of the posterior is not needed for rejection sampling as it
would cancel in the acceptance ratio. So this could eas-
ily be used for sampling from the posterior, however the
main diﬃculty consists of ﬁnding this majorization den-
sity as this would require solving an optimization prob-
lem ﬁrst. In high dimensions, it will also be diﬃcult to
ﬁnd a majorization density that is close enough to the
target to be eﬃcient.

Now, the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is an
extension of rejection sampling in that it avoids having
to use a majorization proposal at the expense of generat-
ing dependent instead of independent samples. It starts
with some arbitrary θ0. The proposal probability den-
θ0) can now depend on θ and does not

and otherwise, the previous value is recycled, i.e., θ1 =

form:

Note that just as in rejection sampling, the normalization
constant of the posterior probability density function is
not required, p(θ∗
d) have the same normal-
|
ization constant and these would cancel out in the accep-
tance probability anyway. In analogy to rejection sam-
pling, the eﬃciency of the MH algorithm depends cru-
cially on the choice of the proposal density. It should be
”close” to the posterior density but easy to sample from.
In practice, multivariate normal or Student-t proposals
are often chosen. The original Metropolis algorithm is
the special case where the proposal probability density
function is symmetric, i.e., q(θ
θ). This algo-
|
rithm generates a Markov chain. Hastings (1970) proved
the remarkable fact that with just about any choice of the
proposal density q, the equilibrium distribution for the
Markov chain is the posterior p(θ
d), as desired. Tier-

ney (1994) gives the ﬁrst comprehensive account of theo-
retical results regarding convergence rates, laws of large

numbers and central limit theorems for estimates ob-
tained by MCMC methods. In particular, Tierney (1994)
showed that the sample average of an ergodic Markov
n=1 θ(n) has asymptotic variance that is by a
chain 1
N
factor of

(cid:80)N

τ = 1 + 2

∞(cid:88)

(cid:96)=1

ρ((cid:96))

larger than if one would average over independent sam-
ples. This factor is the so called integrated autocorrela-
tion time and depends on all lag-(cid:96) autocorrelations ρ((cid:96))
of the MCMC sample and is used as a measure of the
eﬃciency of a MCMC scheme. A valid estimate of τ can
be obtained from CODA (Plummer et al., 2006), which
computes a time series estimate of τ based on the spectral
density estimate at zero (Geweke, 1992).

A special case of the MH algorithm that has found
numerous useful applications in many disciplines is the
Gibbs sampler. Very ﬂexible implementations are avail-
able in the public domain Bayesian software packages
BUGS and JAGS, described in detail in (Lunn et al.,
2013) and (Depaoli et al., 2016), respectively. The pro-
posal density of the Gibbs sampler is the product of full
conditional densities and it is straightforward to show
that the acceptance ratio in the MH algorithm with this
choice of proposal density is one, so every move is ac-
cepted. Each iteration of the Gibbs sampler moves in a
cycle through each component of θ. In cycle n, the Gibbs
sampler generates a new value θ(n)

distribution

).

For many Bayesian hierarchical models, these full condi-
tionals are conjugate distributions and can be sampled
directly. For many nonlinear problems, as for instance in
Christensen and Meyer (1998), a MH algorithm is needed
to sample from the full conditionals. The main disad-
vantage of the Gibbs sampler is that it can converge very
slowly to the equilibrium distribution if the posterior cor-
relations between parameters are large. Reparametriza-
tions that reduce the posterior correlation, blocking or
the introduction of auxiliary variables can improve mix-
ing (Gelman et al., 2014).

For any application of MCMC methods, it is important
to check that the algorithm has converged towards the
joint posterior distribution. Diﬀerent tests for diagnosing
convergence have been established, see e.g. Cowles and
Carlin (1996) and implemented in the R-package CODA
(Plummer et al., 2006).

Various techniques have been developed to improve
mixing, respectively accelerate the convergence of the
Markov chain to the posterior distribution and applied
to estimating gravitational wave parameters. These in-
clude parallel tempering (Swendsen and Wang, 1986) for
moving rapidly through a multimodal target distribution

and avoiding to get stuck in local maxima. In analogy
to the simulated annealing algorithm, parallel tempering
samples in parallel from L chains with target densities
d)1/T(cid:96), (cid:96) = 1, . . . , L for a set of temperature parame-
p(θ
|
ters T(cid:96). T(cid:96) = 1 reduces to the original posterior distribu-
tion, large values of T(cid:96) produce ﬂatter target densities,
helping to avoid local maxima. The chains can jump from
one sampler to another with a certain probability. Only
the samples from the chain with T(cid:96) = 1 are eventually
used for posterior inference. Evolutionary Monte Carlo
(EMC), introduced by Liang and Wong (2001) works in a
similar way to parallel tempering in that a population of
Markov chains at diﬀerent temperatures is generated. In
addition, EMC includes a genetic operator in analogy to
the crossover in a genetic algorithm which often improves
the mixing of the chains. Many variants of crossover
operators have been suggested, one of the most popu-
lar ones is the snooker crossover proposed by Liang and
Wong (2001) which randomly selects a parameter say θi
from the current set of parallel chain values, another one
θj from the remaining ones and a new proposal is gener-
ated by Gibbs sampling along the line connecting θi and
θj. Similarly, with the aim of allowing to jump between
local modes when sampling from multi-modal posteriors,
a diﬀerential evolution proposal (Braak and Vrugt, 2008)
has proven useful in situations where linear correlations
are present (Veitch et al., 2015). It draws two previous
samples θa and θb from the Markov chain and proposes
a new parameter according to

θ∗ = θ + γ(θa

θb)

−

where θ denotes the current parameter and γ is drawn
from N (0, 2.38/√2p). An alternative approach is based
on the intuition that the closer the proposal distribution
is to the target, the faster convergence to stationarity
is achieved. Adaptive MCMC techniques (Roberts and
Rosenthal, 2009) aim to dynamically adjust the proposal
to the target density based on information from previ-
ously sampled values as long as the amount of adap-
tation is diminishing. For instance, for p-dimensional
multivariate normal proposals and targets, the most eﬃ-
cient scale that determines the jump size has been shown
2.38/√p (Gelman et al., 2014). Moreover, the
to be
proposal covariance matrix can be sequentially updated
based on the information from the current samples as
long as the diminishing adaptation condition is satis-
ﬁed. Starting with a p-dimensional Gaussian proposal
qn(θ) = N (θ, 0.12/p Ip) for n
2p, for later steps one
uses the current empirical estimate Σn of the covariance
of the target based on the run so far in deﬁning the pro-
posal

≈

qn(θ) = (1

−

β)N (θ, 2.382/p Σn) + βN (θ, 0.12/p Ip)

where β is a small positive constant, e.g. β = 0.05. Sam-
pling occasionally from the standard Gaussian distribu-

9

tion that is independent of the previous samples guaran-
tees that the algorithm does not get stuck at problematic
values on Σn. Jump sizes can also be dynamically ad-
justed to obtain an optimal empirical acceptance rate of
about 0.44 in one dimension, decreasing to 0.23 in high
dimensions (p > 5). An alternative strategy is delayed
rejection (Tierney and Mira, 1999). The idea behind the
delayed rejection algorithm is that persistent rejection,
perhaps in particular parts of the state space, may indi-
cate that locally the proposal distribution is badly cal-
ibrated to the target. Therefore, the MH algorithm is
modiﬁed so that on rejection, a second attempt to move
is made with a proposal distribution that depends on the
previously rejected state. Delayed rejection was also gen-
eralized to the variable dimension case (Green and Mira,
2001). Hamiltonian Monte Carlo avoids the random walk
behavior and sensitivity to highly correlated parameters
by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gra-
dient information (Neal, 2011), simulating Hamiltonian
dynamics. Open-source software STAN that implements
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in a ﬂexible modeling language
similar to BUGS and JAGS is described in Gelman et al.
(2015).
It uses the No-U-turn sampler (Hoﬀman and
Gelman, 2014) and makes use of an optimizer that iter-
ates to ﬁnd a (local) maximum of the objective function.
As both the sampler and the optimizer require gradi-
ents, a reverse-mode automatic diﬀerentiation method
(Griewank, 2000) is implemented in STAN. A method
that has been very popular in physics is the invariant en-
semble sampler proposed by Goodman and Weare (2010)
and implemented in the open-source Python-based soft-
ware package emcee by Foreman-Mackey et al. (2013).
Similar to parallel tempering, it employs the idea of run-
θ((cid:96))
N
ning L Markov chains
n=1, (cid:96) = 1, . . . , L in parallel,
n }
but now the proposal for the (cid:96)th chain at iteration n de-
pends on the position of the remaining ”walkers” at iter-
ation n using an aﬃne-invariant random transformation,
thus reducing the dependence of run-time on the poste-
rior correlations, reducing the autocorrelation time and
speeding up convergence. For problems where the dimen-
sion of the parameter space is not ﬁxed but variable, as
for instance in multiple change-point problems, variable
selection in regression models, and mixture deconvolu-
tion with an unknown number of components, the MH
algorithm cannot be adopted when proposing transdi-
mensional moves between models. Therefore, the MH al-
gorithm has been extended to the reversible jump MCMC
algorithm (Green, 1995) that constructs jumps between
parameter vectors of diﬀerent dimensions in such a way
as to preserve the detailed balance equations which guar-
antee ergodicity and convergence to the posterior distri-
bution.

{

B. Nested Sampling

Nested sampling was proposed by Skilling (2006) for
computing the evidence or marginal
likelihood of a
Bayesian model and later shown to provide samples from
the posterior distribution as a by-product. It is based on
a simple identity for the expectation of a positive random
variable Y with probability distribution function f (y)
and cumulative distribution function F (y) = (cid:82) y
0 f (x)dx:

E[Y ] =

(cid:90) ∞

yf (y)dy =

This identity can be easily shown using Tonelli’s theorem
(Schilling, 2005) on switching the order of integration in
a double integral as follows:

Nested sampling aims to evaluate the marginal likeli-
hood (the denominator in Bayes theorem (3)): Z =
(cid:82) L(d

θ) takes the role of the positive random variable Y .

where ϕi = ϕ(xi) and the grid values 0 < xN < . . . <

e.g. xi = e−
usually intractable and needs to be approximated by an
iterative algorithm:

• At iteration 1: The nested sampling algorithm
starts with N walkers θ(1)

drawn independently from the prior, determines
θ1 = arg min1

Skilling (2006) pointed out that nested sampling not
only provides an estimate of Z but also a sample ˜θi
from the posterior distribution if one assigns appro-
priate importance sampling weights to θi, i.e., deﬁnes
˜θi = (xi

xi)ϕiθi.

Nested sampling has a convergence rate of O(N −
and computational costs O(p3) where p is the number of
parameters (Chopin and Robert, 2010). As pointed out
by Chopin and Robert (2010), the practical diﬃculty of
nested sampling is simulation from the prior subject to
the inequality constraint L(θ) > L(θi). Skilling (2006)
proposed to use a ﬁnite number of MCMC steps, how-
ever convergence of nested sampling when correlations
are introduced by any embedded MCMC scheme, is an
open problem. Mukherjee et al. (2006) consider simulat-
ing points within an ellipsoid and accept if they satisfy
the constraint. Chopin and Robert (2010) propose an
importance sampling method to sample from the con-
strained prior, nested importance sampling, employing a
similar ellipsoid strategy in scenarios where the poste-
rior mode and Hessian at the mode are available. Fur-
ther variants of constrained sampling are nested sampling
with constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Betancourt
et al., 2011), Galilean nested sampling (Skilling, 2012),
slice sampling (Aitken and Akman, 2013) and diﬀusive
nested sampling (Brewer and Foreman-Mackey, 2018a).
Feroz et al. (2009) and Feroz and Skilling (2013) devel-
oped so-called MultiNest, nested sampling for multimodal
distributions that has become popular in cosmological
and astrophysical applications. However, MultiNest per-
forms ineﬃciently in dimensions larger than 20 as a large
part of the sampling region might fall below the likelihood
threshold and gives biased results when erroneously ex-
cluding relevant prior volume from the sampling region
(Buchner, 2016). Buchner (2016) developed a test to
diagnose these types of potential failures of nested sam-
pling.

C. Model Comparison

In order to test and compare competing models within

This high-dimensional integral does not have an analytic

for its calculation.

Several computational approaches for calculating the
marginal likelihood exist, for reviews see e.g. Robert et al.
(2009) and Gelman et al. (2014), and for a comparison
in the context of LISA data analysis see e.g. Cornish
and Littenberg (2007). Here we give a comprehensive
overview in the hope that some of the methods that have
received little attention within astrophysics so far might
ﬁnd more uptake and provide a valuable addition to the
toolkit for model comparison of gravitational wave mod-
els.

1. Under certain regularity conditions, the Bayesian

information criterion (BIC), deﬁned as

−

M

BIC =

) + p ln n

ˆθ,
2 ln L(d
|
where ˆθ denotes the maximum likelihood estimate,
p the number of parameters, and n the sample size,
provides an approximation to
2 ln Z. It combines
a measure of goodness-of-ﬁt, the log-likelihood eval-
uated at the maximum likelihood estimate, and a

−

11

measure of complexity that penalizes the number
of parameters. Alternatively, Akaike’s information
criterion (AIC) is often used for practical model
selection (Cavanaugh and Neath, 2019). It diﬀers
from the BIC only in the penalty term 2p instead
of p ln n. Frequentist analysis shows that the BIC
score is an asymptotically consistent model selec-
tion procedure under weak conditions. But there is
no contribution of the prior to the BIC, so it is not
a Bayesian criterion. A Bayesian analogue, the de-
viance information criterion (DIC) was developed
by Spiegelhalter et al. (2002). The DIC is based
on the deviance D(θ) =
). While
BIC uses the maximum likelihood estimate, DIC’s
plug-in estimate is based on the posterior mean of
the deviance ¯D(θ) = Eθ

DIC = ¯D(θ) + pD

D(¯θ)
where the measure of complexity pD = ¯D(θ)
is the diﬀerence between the posterior mean of the
deviance and the deviance at the posterior mean.
It can be justiﬁed as an estimate of the posterior
predictive model performance within a decision-
theoretic framework and it is asymptotically equiv-
alent to leave-one-out cross-validation. The DIC
has been used extensively for practical model com-
parison in many disciplines as it is easy to com-
pute when a sample of the posterior distribution is
available (Meyer, 2016; Spiegelhalter et al., 2014).
Another main advantage is that unlike the Bayes
factor, it can be used even if improper priors are
speciﬁed.

It requires ﬁnding the posterior mode,
which can be done using standard optimization
methods such as gradient search, and computing
second derivatives for which automatic diﬀerentia-
tion tools (Griewank, 2000) might be useful. How-
ever, the Laplace approximation can be inaccurate

e.g. when the posterior distribution is multimodal
or severely skewed.

3. The harmonic mean estimator goes back to New-
ton and Raftery (1994) and is straightforward to
calculate when a sample θi, i = 1, . . . N from the
posterior distribution is available. The estimator
is deﬁned as the harmonic mean of the likelihood
values:

It is easy to calculate but can be biased and un-
reliable due to its potentially inﬁnite variance, see
e.g. the discussion by Radford Neal of Newton and
Raftery (1994). An improvement of the harmonic
mean estimator is given by the representation

in Marin and Robert (2010) which holds for any
function φ. For φ = π, this estimator ˆZ ∗HM equals
the ordinary harmonic mean estimator ˆZHM . But
choosing a function φ with lighter tails than the
posterior, e.g. for φ with constrained support given
by the convex hull of sampled values within the 10%
highest posterior density region, guarantees ﬁnite
variance.

4. An approximation of the marginal likelihood is also
possible via classical importance sampling (Marin
and Robert, 2010). A sample θi, i = 1, . . . , N is
drawn from an importance density q(θ) and Z es-
timated by

where q can be chosen so that the variance of the
importance sampling estimate is reduced. This im-
plies choosing importance functions that provide
good approximations to the posterior distribution,
as for instance maximum likelihood asymptotic dis-
tributions or kernel approximations based on a pilot
sample. Importance sampling distributions should
have fatter tails than the target density.

5. Thermodynamic integration or the more general
path sampling (Gelman and Meng, 1998; Neal,
2001; Xie et al., 2011) make use of an auxiliary in-
verse temperature variable β, 0
1, to deﬁne
transitional distributions, namely the power poste-
rior distributions, deﬁned by

then be estimated by the sample average. The inte-
gral in equation (15) is approximated by numerical
integration, e.g. using the trapezoidal or Simpson’s
rule.

6. Another method that combines importance sam-
pling and simulated annealing is the stepping-stone
sampling algorithm, widely used in phylogenet-
ics where it was proposed by Xie et al. (2011).
The marginal likelihood can be seen as the ratio
Z = Z1/Z0, where Z0 = 1 since the prior is as-
sumed to be proper. The direct calculation of this
ratio via importance sampling is not reliable be-
cause the distributions involved in the numerator
and denominator (posterior and prior, respectively)
are, in general, quite diﬀerent. To solve this prob-
lem, stepping-stone sampling expands this ratio in
a telescope product of L ratios of normalizing con-
stants of the transitional distributions that is

tios can be estimated with higher accuracy than Z1
Z0
because the distributions in the numerator and de-
nominator are generally quite similar when using a
reasonable number of temperatures L. In this situ-
ation the importance sampling method works well.
The stepping-stone sampling algorithm estimates
each ratio r(cid:96) by importance sampling using pβ(cid:96)−1
as importance sampling distribution. This is a suit-
able distribution because it has heavier tails than

pβ(cid:96) which leads to an eﬃcient estimate of r(cid:96). The
estimation of each ratio is based on the identity

Maturana-Russel et al. (2019) demonstrate the per-
formance and computational costs of the stepping-
stone sampling in comparison to thermodynamic
integration and nested sampling in a simulation
study and a case study of computing the marginal
likelihood of a binary black hole merger signal ap-
plied to simulated data from the Advanced LIGO
and Advanced Virgo gravitational wave detectors.

7. For the analysis of gravitational wave signals, the
nested sampling algorithm is often used for model
comparison. Nested sampling has already been de-
scribed in detail in Sec. III.B as it provides samples
from the posterior distribution at the same time as
computing the evidence. Maturana-Russel et al.
(2019) describe a block bootstrap method to deter-
mine the Monte Carlo standard error of evidence
estimates and apply this both to estimates based
on the stepping-stone and nested sampling.

8. The previous model comparison methods used
Monte Carlo samples from each model to estimate
each evidence. A conceptually diﬀerent approach
to model comparison is given by the reversible
jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algo-
rithm (Green, 1995). RJMCMC constructs a sin-
gle Markov chain that includes moves between both
models and thus requires trans-dimensional moves.
The parameter space for such a chain includes the
traditional parameters and an indication of the cur-
rent model.
It makes use of additional random
variables that enable a matching of dimensions of
the models with potentially diﬀerent number of pa-
rameters. The dimension-matching ensures that
the detailed balance equations hold that are nec-
essary to prove convergence of the MH algorithm.

13

The proportion of iterations the RJMCMC algo-
rithm spends in one model is a consistent estimate
of its posterior probability and used via equation
(8) to estimate the Bayes factor. For a detailed de-
scription of the RJMCMC algorithm and an early
application to the LISA source confusion problem,
see (Umst¨atter et al., 2005a).

D. Rapid Parameter Estimation

In order to get information to multi-messenger observ-
ing partners as rapidly as possible it is important to have
methods to improve the computational speed of param-
eter estimation. The LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015)
implementations of MCMC and nested sampling provide
accurate parameter estimates but at the cost of exten-
sive computation times that range from several hours for
short signals of black hole mergers to weeks for longer
neutron star coalescences. Various strategies have been
employed to reduce the overall computation time which
is largely dominated by the time to re-evaluate the like-
lihood in each MCMC or nested sampling step. To this
end, Cornish (2010, 2021) and Zackay et al. (2018) use
the heterodyning principle and relative binning, respec-
tively, for fast likelihood evaluation. With heterodyning,
two signals with similar frequencies are multiplied to-
gether, producing a low-frequency signal containing the
useful information, and a high frequency signal that is
discarded. The relative binning concerns the subsequent
greatly reduced number of frequency bins used in the
analysis, hence greatly increasing the calculation speed.
Accurate approximative methods based on reduced-order
models of gravitational waveforms have been developed
(Canizares et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016). Fast reduced-
order quadrature allows to approximate posterior distri-
butions at greatly reduced computational costs. A review
of waveform acceleration techniques based on reduced or-
der or surrogate models that speed up parameter estima-
tion is provided in Setyawati et al. (2020). Vinciguerra
et al. (2017) use the chirping behaviour of compact bi-
nary inspirals to sample sparsely for portions where the
full frequency resolution is not required; an extension of
this work for IMRPhenomXHM models (Garc´ıa-Quir´os
et al., 2020) is presented in Garc´ıa-Quir´os et al. (2021).
An alternative approach for rapid parameter estimation
is based on highly-parallelizable grid-based techniques,
see Pankow et al. (2015) and Lange et al. (2018), and
has been successfully used for parameter estimation in
the third observing runs (Abbott et al., 2020h, 2021d).
The corresponding package is called RIFT and described
in Section X.E.

The acceleration techniques above yield estimates of
all intrinsic and extrinsic parameters but are still high-
latency (Sidery et al., 2014). If the primary focus is on
obtaining rapid estimates of the sky location and distance

in order to alert electromagnetic observatories to enable
follow-up searches for counterpart transient events, the
measured time of arrival of a signal at diﬀerent detectors
can be used to triangulate the source position (Cavalier
et al., 2006; Fairhurst, 2009, 2011). Grover et al. (2014)
and Fairhurst (2018) improve the timing triangulation
by including phase consistency information. Berry et al.
(2015) showed that timing triangulation can often be a
poor approximation. Timing triangulation can provide
the sky position in about a minute (or maybe less) but
at the expense of accuracy. A rapid as well as accurate
Bayesian sky localization algorithm known as Bayesian
triangulation and rapid localization (BAYESTAR) was
developed by Singer and Price (2016). It avoids expen-
sive post-Newtonian model waveforms and MCMC itera-
tions by simplifying the likelihood function. BAYESTAR
conditions on the intrinsic parameters and uses the max-
imum likelihood estimates of the time delay, amplitude
and phase on arrival at each of the network detectors as
data to construct an approximate likelihood. Numerical
quadrature is used to obtain the marginal posterior dis-
tribution of the sky location and parallelization at pixel
level yields estimates of the sky position 104 times faster
than LALInference, within a minute of detection, at an
accuracy comparable to the full coherent MCMC-based
posterior inference (Berry et al., 2015).

E. Machine Learning

To speed up parameter estimation, deep learning ap-
proaches, particularly variational autoencoders and con-
volutional neural networks, have recently been explored
(Alvares et al., 2020; Chua and Vallisneri, 2020; Gab-
bard et al., 2019; George and Huerta, 2018; Green et al.,
2020; Shen et al., 2022). Deep learning approaches train
neural networks to learn the posterior through stochastic
gradient descent to optimize a loss function. The train-
ing samples require only sampling from the prior and
the likelihood which is fast.
It also has the advantage
that training can be performed oﬄine and the estima-
tion of parameters from an observed gravitational wave
signal becomes almost instantaneous. A recent summary
of how machine learning might aid gravitational wave sig-
nal searches is presented in Cuoco et al. (2021). These
methods are still in their infancy and are being further
developed to be able to handle the full parameter space
of binary inspirals (Green and Gair, 2020) and longer
duration waveforms from multiple detectors. They hold
great promise for low-latency parameter estimation and
a fast electromagnetic follow-up. Machine learning ap-
proaches have also been explored to produce a fast ap-
proximation to waveform generation (Khan and Green,
2021; Schmidt et al., 2021), and much quicker parameter
estimation (Dax et al., 2021).

IV. NOISE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY ESTIMATION

It is critical for the accurate estimation of the physical
parameters to also accurately estimate the noise PSD
for each of the detectors.
In the previous section, the
noise PSDs were assumed to be known so that the factors
relating to the determinant of the PSD matrices in the
Whittle likelihood approximation

could be ignored, yielding the simpler likelihood in Eq. 6.
In practical LIGO data analyses, the noise PSD has often
been estimated oﬀ-source by the Welch method (Welch,
1967) which averages the periodograms of several time
segments of noise close to but not including the signal
and with the same length as the signal segment. This
averaging reduces the variance and provides a consistent
estimate of the PSD. For the purpose of parameter esti-
mation, this Welch estimate or the median of the peri-
odograms (Veitch et al., 2015) has then often been substi-
tuted for the true PSD in Eq. 6 and assumed known and
ﬁxed. But as demonstrated by Zackay et al. (2021), the
noise PSD of LIGO data drifts slowly over timescales of
dozens of seconds to minutes and failures to take this into
account results in a loss of sensitivity in matched ﬁlter
searches for graviational waves. Similarly, Chatziioannou
et al. (2019a) show the potential eﬀects of this so-called
oﬀ-source PSD estimation on parameter estimates in sim-
ulation studies. They ﬁnd that the fractional change in
the width of posterior credible intervals ranges from a
few percent to 25%. Their work demonstrates the supe-
riority of on-source PSD estimation, i.e., using the sig-
nal segment for simultaneously estimating the PSD and
waveform parameters. Furthermore, assuming the noise
PSD to be known does not take the full uncertainty into
account and might yield too narrow credible bands for
the physical parameters, as shown in Biscoveanu et al.
(2020a).

In this section, we review methods for spectral density
estimation. In Sec. IV.A we ﬁrst consider techniques for
estimating the noise PSD for time series that consist of
pure instrumental noise before combining these with pa-
rameter estimation methods for time series consisting of
signal and noise in Sec. IV.B.

A. Estimation of the Power Spectral Density Estimation
With No Signals Present

For ease of exposition, let us consider a data stream
in just one detector. Furthermore, we assume that the
data does not contain any gravitational wave signal, i.e.,
d(t) = n(t), t = 1, . . . , T . Under the usual assumption
of stationarity and Gaussianity, the Whittle likelihood

takes the form

A parametric method to estimate the PSD was intro-
duced by R¨over et al. (2011) by putting conjugate inverse
Gamma distributions on the unknown spectral densities
S(fj) which yielded Student-t marginal distributions for
the errors. Though fast to compute, this estimate is not
consistent in that the posterior distribution of the PSD
estimate will not concentrate around the true spectral
density with increasing sample size. A closely related
approach that also attempts to account for the uncer-
tainty in the PSD is given by Littenberg et al. (2013)
and Veitch et al. (2015) that treats S(fj) as ﬁxed but in-
troduces an additional scale factor ηj for each frequency
bin, i.e., replacing S(fj) by ηjS(fj) and placing Normal
priors on ηj with mean 1. Talbot and Thrane (2020) de-
rived the likelihood after marginalization over the uncer-
tainty in the median PSD estimate and show that their
analysis is robust with respect to outliers. They also in-
vestigate the impact of mean- and median-based noise
PSD estimation methods on the astrophysical inference
of GW151012. Cuoco et al. (2001) employed the classical
parametric spectral density estimation methods based on
ﬁtting autoregressive and autoregressive moving average
models.

But even though parametric models are eﬃcient when
is correctly speciﬁed, they can
the parametric model
give biased results under model misspeciﬁcation. There-
fore, considering the presence of glitches (short du-
ration noise transients) and slow adiabatic drift in
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA noise, robust Bayesian nonpara-
metric approaches to PSD estimation have been devel-
oped. These can then be combined with Bayesian es-
timation of the model parameters when a gravitational
wave signal is present, as illustrated in Sec. IV.B. The
BayesLine algorithm (Littenberg and Cornish, 2015) uses
a mixture of Lorentzians and cubic splines to model
spectral lines and the smooth part of the PSD, respec-
tively. BayesLine is a component of the BayesWave anal-
ysis (Cornish and Littenberg, 2015; Cornish et al., 2021).
This is a very ﬂexible approximation that treats the num-
ber and location of the knots of the cubics splines and
also the number, location and line width of the spectral
lines as unknown parameters. This approach then uses
a RJMCMC procedure to allow for the change in dimen-
sion of the parameter space. Edwards et al. (2019) mod-
iﬁed the Bernstein-Dirichlet process prior on the PSD
speciﬁed by Choudhuri et al. (2004). The Bernstein-
Dirichlet process prior models the PSD by a mixture
of Bernstein polynomials where the number of mixture
components is variable and the mixture weights are in-

duced by a Dirichlet process. To improve on the ap-
proximation properties of Bernstein polynomials, Ed-
wards et al. (2019) suggested to replace these by B-
splines and put a second Dirichlet process prior on the
knot spacings. They demonstrate the method’s ability to
pick up sharp spectral peaks and lines in the data from
the LIGO S6 science run. To speed up this algorithm,
Maturana-Russel and Meyer (2021) use P-splines, i.e.,
B-splines with ﬁxed number and location of knots where
the smoothness prior is derived from the diﬀerence-based
penalty of penalized splines, avoiding the computation-
ally intensive Dirichlet process prior and reversible jump
type simulations. These algorithms are implemented in
the R-packages bsplinePsd (Edwards et al., 2018) and
psplinePsd (Maturana-Russel and Meyer, 2020).
In-
stead of modifying the Bernstein-Dirichlet process prior,
(Kirch et al., 2019) improve the Whittle likelihood ap-
proximation by making use of an autoregressive working
model. They prove posterior consistency, superior small
sample performance measured by integrated absolute er-
ror and frequentist coverage probability, and achieve a
better estimation of sharp peaks in the PSD as demon-
strated using LIGO S6 noise and shown in Fig. 5. The im-
plementation of this PSD estimation method is available
in the R package beyondWhittle (Meier et al., 2018).

B. Estimation of the Power Spectral Density Estimation
with Signals Present

Biscoveanu et al. (2020a) quantiﬁed the eﬀect of PSD
uncertainty on waveform parameter estimates by ﬁrst
sampling from the PSD using BayesWave and then ob-
taining samples from the compact binary coalescence
waveform parameters conditional on each sampled PSD,

−110−105−100−95−900.00.51.01.52.0Frequency [kHz]log PSDstill not simultaneously sampling from the joint posterior
distribution of waveform parameters and PSD. Currently,
the most often used method to simultaneously estimate
the PSD and the signal waveform is BayesWave (Cornish
and Littenberg, 2015; Cornish et al., 2021). BayesWave
combines the BayesLine PSD estimation method with si-
multaneously estimating a gravitational wave transient
signal and glitches, both modeled as a mixture of Morlet-
Gabor wavelets. While this gives estimates of the Morlet-
Gabor wavelet coeﬃcients and can thus reconstruct the
signal taking the full uncertainty in the PSD estimate
into account, it is not intended for estimating the astro-
physical waveform parameters.

Most of the Bayesian noise PSD estimation techniques
discussed in Sec. IV.A lend themselves to a simultaneous
estimation of interferometer-speciﬁc PSDs S(k) and as-
trophysical waveform parameters θ via the Whittle like-
lihood Eq. 16. In general, this can be done by combining
the respective MCMC algorithms used for parameter and
PSD estimation in a Gibbs sampling step. One iterates
between

• conditioning on a PSD estimate and performing one
iteration of the parameter estimation routine,

• then conditioning on the just obtained new esti-
mate of θ, calculating the residuals ˜d(k)
˜h(k)(.

and performing one iteration of the PSD MCMC
routine.

This Gibbs sampling procedure has been applied by (Ed-
wards et al., 2015) to simultaneously ﬁt rotating core
collapse supernova gravitational wave burst signals em-
bedded in simulated Advanced LIGO – Advanced Virgo
noise and the PSD using the Bernstein-Dirichlet process
prior and by Edwards et al. (2020) to simultaneously es-
timate the parameters of a galactic binary signal and the
noise PSD in simulated LISA data using the B-spline
prior. Similarly, in a blocked Gibbs sampler Chatziioan-
nou et al. (2021) simultaneously estimates the compact
binary coalescence waveform parameters and the noise
PSD using BayesLine and extends this to the simul-
taneous estimation of instrumental glitches using sine-
gaussian wavelets. Thus, in the applications in Edwards
et al. (2015), Edwards et al. (2020) and Chatziioannou
et al. (2021), the marginal posterior distributions of the
signal parameters take the full uncertainty of the PSD
estimates into account. This is in contrast to Chatziioan-
nou et al. (2019a) who used the BayesWave PSD estimate
that was obtained from the same stretch of data as the
signal but assumed ﬁxed for the purpose of parameter es-
timation of injected compact binary coalescence signals
in real LIGO O2 noise.

V. PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR GRAVITATIONAL
WAVES FROM COALESCING COMPACT BINARIES

The gravitational wave observations from LIGO and
Virgo to date have all been produced by compact binary
systems (Abbott et al., 2021d). This is a system where
there is an exellent ability to use a waveform model for
its expected emitted signal that can be compared with
the observed data. Black holes and neutron stars are
compact objects, and behave like point particles, hence
simplifying the analysis. As we will see below, tidal ef-
fects will deform a neutron star at some level, and this
will change the inspiral behavior. But to start, one can
assume the validity of general relativity and derive the
evolution of a binary system of point particles, with the
system losing energy due to the emission of gravitational
waves. General relativity is a non-linear theory, so it
will ultimately be impossible to produce a closed form or
exact functional description for the gravitational waves,
and approximations with diﬀerent levels of accuracy will
be used. The methods used to derive waveforms will
be summarized below. There are excellent descriptions
of the physics of coalescing compact binary mergers, and
what information can be extracted from their observation
with gravitational waves, to be found in Sathyaprakash
and Schutz (2009) and Abbott et al. (2017c).

We start with the lowest level of approximation, which
is essentially coupling Newtonian orbital mechanics and
gravitational wave emission via linearized general relativ-
ity. This presentation is for the dominant quadrupolar
multipole moment of radiation. We follow the presenta-
tion of Moore (2013), and use this as a means to develop
an understanding of the physical parameters before mov-
ing on to more complex waveform theories.

Consider two point masses, m1 and m2, orbiting
around one another and separated by a distance of D.
The total mass is M = m1 + m2, while the dimension-
less mass ratio is η = m1m2/(m1 + m2)2. The orbital
frequency of the system is f . An observer directly above
the orbital plane of the system a distance R away would
observe the gravitational wave strain

where the two polarization states are represented by h+
and h
. This is a circular polarization. φ0 is a phase
shift depending on the initial conditions. If one observes
the binary system edge on from a distance R, then the
gravitational waves received will be

h =

8π2GM ηD2f 2

so linearly polarized, and smaller in magnitude by a fac-

of ι with respect to the normal of the orbital plane. In
this case the amplitude of the h+ polarization component
will be diminished by a factor of (1 + cos2ι)/2, while the
amplitude of the h
polarization component will be di-
minished by cos ι (Usman et al., 2019). Note that the
gravitational wave signal frequency is twice the orbital
frequency, fgw = 2f ; this is the frequency of the grav-
itational wave that will be detected. Since the system
is losing energy via gravitational wave emission, the or-
bit will decay. This will cause the orbital frequency to
increase,

df

(19)

This deﬁnes the frequency evolution of the system and
the gravitational wave signal. The frequency evolution is
what results in the chirp like signal. As the binary sys-
tem’s orbit decays the frequency of the resulting gravi-
tational wave signal will increase, and consequently the
amplitude will increase as well.

One can then calculate the time it will take for the
two masses to spiral into one another. Starting from a
separation distance of D0 the coalescence time, namely
when the masses collide at D = 0 is

tc =

5D0c5
256η(GM )3 .

(20)

This simple calculation essentially assumes an orbit de-
scribed by Kepler’s Laws, with energy loss from the emis-
sion of gravitational waves. However, the general evolu-
tion of the system is evident.
It is also now possible
to see which parameters pertaining to the source can be
described using parameter estimation methods on the de-
tected gravitation wave signal.

×

Gravitational wave signals from compact binary coa-
lescence have been detected by LIGO and Virgo (Ab-
bott et al., 2019b). These detectors are L-shaped, hence
quadrupole detectors. A gravitational wave descending
directly downward (normal incidence) on such a detector
will register the maximal response for the h+ polariza-
tion and no response for the h
polarization. Of course
gravitational waves can come from any direction. Let us
deﬁne a Cartesian coordinate system with the arms of the
detector deﬁning the x and y directions, with z normal
to those in a right hand sense. The units for the sky loca-
tion of an astronomical source are right ascension (RA)
and declination (Dec). But in terms of the Cartesian co-
ordinate system, we can say that the angle between the
propagation direction of the gravitational wave, k, and
the z axis is θ. The projection of k onto the x-y plane
makes an angle φ with respect to the x axis. Finally, ψ
deﬁnes the angle of polarization about the k direction of
propagation. A quadrupole detector will respond to the
incoming gravitational wave with a detected signal of

While it is diﬃcult to determine the sky location of
the source with just one interferometer, with two detec-
tors one can use the interferometer responses and delay
in the arrival time of the signal to constrain the source
location (R¨over et al., 2007a,b). The addition of more
detectors improves the ability to resolve a source (Ab-
bott et al., 2020b; Pankow et al., 2020). The current
LIGO-Virgo network of three detectors has already suc-
ceeded in estimating the sky-location of GW170817 to
28 deg2. The long-term goal is to have a world-wide net-
work of 5 detectors, which in addition to the two LIGO
detectors and Virgo would include the Japanese KAGRA
detector (Akutsu et al., 2017; Aso et al., 2013) and a third
LIGO detector in India (Unnikrishnan, 2013). With such
a network it should be possible to constrain the location
of a compact binary source to a few deg2 on the sky.

One can now see the parameters that can be estimated
using the data from gravitational wave detectors. With
even just one detector it is possible (with suﬃcient SNR)
to produce estimates of the two mass parameters, m1 and
m2, the time of coalescence tc, and the inspiral phase φ0.
With two or more detectors, estimates can be made of
the sky position (RA and Dec), the distance to the source
R, orbital plane inclination angle ι, and the polarization
angle ψ. More complicated orbits, for example including
eccentricity, would consquently require additional param-
eters for the model.

In terms of parameter estimation, the mass parameter
which can be estimated most accurately is the chirp mass,
c (Eq. 1). This is because it is the mass term that
M
directly inﬂuences the frequency derivative. For example,
Eq. 19 can be rewritten as

df
dt

=

192π
5c5 (2πf G

M

c)5/3f 2 .

(24)

M

Hence
c is the only mass term that contributes to the
frequency evolution. The orbital frequency f is certainly
an important parameter for describing the physical sys-
tem producing the gravitational waves, but the detec-
tors will be directly observing the gravitational wave fre-
quency fgw = 2f . Hence the time evolution of the phase
terms in Eq. 17 and Eq. 18 will vary like 2πfgwt.

The signal model presented above has neglected to ad-
dress the fact that the universe is expanding. Gravita-
tional waves that have been emitted at a large distance
will experience a redshift, and the detected gravitational

wave frequency will be less than the emitted frequency
by a factor of 1 + z, where z is the cosmological redshift
of the signal source. With the expanding universe the
gravitational wave signal will provide an estimate of the
luminosity distance (Moore, 2013), DL, which we will
henceforth use instead of R. When LIGO and Virgo de-
tect a gravitational wave signal from a compact binary
coalescence, the masses derived via parameter estimation
will be the detector frame masses. The physical parame-
ters that are needed to understand the origin of the signal
are the source frame masses (Krolak and Schutz, 1987).
One must divide the detector frame masses by 1 + z to
produce those of the source frame. This requires the use
of additional cosmological information. Objects in the
expanding universe move away from us at velocity v that
is related to the distance D via the Hubble constant, H0,
by

v = H0 D .

(25)

The coalescing binary gravitational wave signal provides
an estimate for the luminosity distance to the source.
Converting distance to redshift requires the assumption
about the cosmology of the universe. LIGO and Virgo
have been using the cosmological parameters derived
from the Planck observations of the cosmic microwave
background (Ade et al., 2016). The cosmological calcu-
lation converts the luminosity distance to a redshift.

Ultimately one must use general relativity to describe
everything about the evolution of the binary system.
While Newtonian equations of motion emerge as an ap-
proximation to general relativity, it should be no surprise
that it is necessary to use the full theory of general rela-
tivity to describe the orbital mechanics and gravitational
wave emission. As an example of the diﬀerence between
Newtonian orbits and those from general relativity, con-
sider a point particle in an orbit about a central mass M .
For Newtonian mechanics, the radial acceleration is

d2r
dt2 = −

GM
r2 +

(cid:96)2
r3 ,

(26)

where t is coordinate time, and (cid:96) is the anglular mo-
mentum per unit mass. On the other hand, the radial
acceleration from general relativity is

d2r
dτ 2 = −

GM
r2 +

(cid:96)2
r3 −

3GM (cid:96)2
c2r4

,

(27)

where τ is the proper time. With Newtonian gravity it
is possible to have a stable circular orbit for any radius.
However the eﬀect of the additional term in Eq. 27 creates
an innermost stable circular orbit. For r < 6GM/c2 it is
not possible to sustain a circular orbit, and the particle
will fall toward r = 0 (Moore, 2013). This has important
implications for predicting the gravitational wave signal
for a coalescing compact binary. The derivation above

18

considered the gravitational wave emission from the in-
spiral part of the signal, but an accurate description must
also consider this plunge part of the signal.

The no-hair theorem says that black holes in general
relativity can be completely described by three param-
eters: their mass, their spin (angular momentum), and
their electric charge (Misner et al., 1973). Astrophysi-
cal black holes will likely be uncharged (the surrounding
plasma will quickly neutralize any net charge) (Narayan,
2005), and will be described by their mass and spin,
namely Kerr black holes (Kerr, 1963). For a binary black
hole coalescence the ﬁnal part of the process, after the
plunge, will be the merger of the two initial black holes
to form a ﬁnal black hole. By the no-hair theorem the
ﬁnal product of the merger must be a Kerr black hole.
This means that the merger process will be the initial
formation of a black hole that undergoes a ringdown to a
ﬁnal stable conﬁguration. This merger-ringdown process
will result in gravitational wave emission as well. In fact,
the observed gravitational waves from the ringdown of
a newly formed black hole can be used to test the no-
hair theorem; see Dreyer et al. (2004), Kamaretsos et al.
(2012) and Isi et al. (2019b).

The spin of the initial component masses will add six
additional parameters. Essentially, these are the total
spin magnitude and the spin direction (being a vector) for
each initial mass. While general relativity is the correct
theory of gravity, one can consider the limit when the
theory is well approximated by Newtonian gravity. The
gravitational ﬁeld (cid:126)g((cid:126)r) at (cid:126)r created by a point mass M
at the origin is

(cid:126)g((cid:126)r) = −

GM ˆr
r2

.

(28)

Similarly, the electric ﬁeld (cid:126)E((cid:126)r) at (cid:126)r created by a point
charge Q at the origin is (Coulomb’s Law)

(cid:126)E((cid:126)r) =

keQˆr
r2

,

(29)

with ke the Coulomb constant. The form of the equations
is similar. And while we know that a moving charge will
create a magnetic ﬁeld (cid:126)B, it should not come as a surprise
that a moving mass would create a so-called gravitomag-
netic ﬁeld (cid:126)BG (Moore, 2013). The eﬀect of gravitomag-
netism would cause a spinning gyroscope orbiting the
(rotating) Earth to be torqued through Lense-Thirring
precession and geodetic precession. The measurement of
these eﬀects was the goal of NASA’s Gravity Probe B
mission (Everitt et al., 2011).

For compact binary systems we can make a compari-
son with atoms and spin-orbit coupling. For the binary
system there will be a coupling between the gravitomag-
netic ﬁeld created by the orbital angular momentum, and
the gravitomagnetic ﬁeld created by the spins of the com-
pact objects. This will aﬀect the orbital dynamics, and

hence the generation of the gravitational waves. The spin
angular momentum, (cid:126)Sj, of a black hole of mass mj will
vary in magnitude between 0 and a maximum allowed by
general relativity of Gm2
j /c. One often uses the dimen-
sionless spin vector, (cid:126)χj = (cid:126)Sjc/(Gm2
j ), whose magnitude
varies from 0 to a maximum of 1 by cosmic censorship (a
proposition to avoid naked singularities) (Wald, 1997).

LIGO and Virgo report their results in terms of two
global eﬀective spin parameters, in addition to the indi-
vidual component spins. The eﬀective inspiral spin pa-
rameter, χeﬀ , is a mass averaged sum of the spins of the
two initial masses aligned with the orbital angular mo-
mentum, as presented in Santamar´ıa et al. (2010), Ajith
et al. (2011) and Abbott et al. (2019b). The eﬀective
precession spin parameter, χp, is a measure of the com-
ponent masses spin parallel to the orbital plane (Hannam
et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2015). The presence of χp will
change the dynamics of the orbit, creating for example, a
precession of the orbital plane (Apostolatos, 1996; Apos-
tolatos et al., 1994). A waveform model that includes
spins is more complex, but it is also representative of
how we expect to observe black holes and neutron stars.
The ﬁrst step in complexity will be models that consider
only the presence of spin in the direction of the obital an-
gular momentum, the so-called spin-aligned models with
a χeﬀ . The more complete and more complex model also
considers spin in the orbital plane, hence with orbital pre-
cession, and a non-zero χp. These models are described
below in Sec. V.A.

A. Binary Black Hole

The gravitational waves from a binary black hole are
the simplest binary system to predict, as black holes have
no internal structure that must be taken into account.
That said, it will still require 15 parameters to describe
the gravitational waves produced by a binary black hole
system in a circular (namely non-eccentric) orbit. The re-
search into the prediction of the gravitational waveforms
goes back many years. In Landau and Lifshitz (1951) the
dynamics of the orbit of a binary system, the production
of gravitational waves, and the decay of a circular or-
bit via energy loss from gravitational wave emission are
addressed.

In the early 1960s the complexity of the binary orbit
was increased. The evolution of a binary in an eccentric
orbit was studied by Peters and Mathews (1963), and it
was shown that gravitational wave emission would cause
the orbit to circularize. This then led to a subsequent
study where the emission of gravitational waves from a
binary system is derived via approximative solutions de-
rived using expansions of the ﬁeld equations in terms of
the gravitational coupling constant and the velocity of
the masses with respect to the speed of light, v/c (Pe-
ters, 1964). The expansion methods have become crit-

19

ically important in the evolution of gravitational wave-
form development. The study of Peters (1964) presented
a derivation of both the energy and the angular momen-
tum carried away from a binary by gravitational waves;
this was demonstrated for a binary system with eccen-
tricity.

A strong motivation for the study of binary systems
was provided by Hulse and Taylor (1975) with the dis-
covery of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16.
It was
quickly realized that this system would provide an excel-
lent opportunity to test general relativity (Damour and
Ruﬃni, 1974), and especially the existence of gravita-
tional waves (Wagoner, 1975). The decay of the orbit of
PSR 1913+16 was convincingly conﬁrmed by Taylor and
Weisberg (1982), showing that the energy loss was ex-
actly what one would expect with general relativity and
the emission of gravitational waves. Years of subsequent
observations have even more convincingly supported the
initial observations (Taylor and Weisberg, 1989; Weisberg
and Huang, 2016; Weisberg et al., 2010).

By the 1970s the activity associated with the devel-
opment of gravitational wave detectors was well under-
way. These detector projects included the resonant bar
detectors (Boughn et al., 1977; Weber, 1969, 1970), and
laser interferometers (Billing et al., 1979; Forward, 1978;
Weiss, 1972). Simultaneously there was a rapid develop-
ment of the theoretical physics methods to more accu-
rately describe the gravitational wave signals that these
detectors would hopefully soon observe. A method to ap-
proximate the solutions to the non-linear Einstein equa-
tion is to derive order-by-order deviations from New-
tonian gravity, the so-called post-Newtonian formalism.
These approximative solutions are expansions in terms of
small parameters, similar to a Taylor series. Epstein and
Wagoner (1975) used a post-Newtonian approximation
expansion in general relativity to describe the gravita-
tional radiation ﬁeld and the energy ﬂux from sources.
The expansion was done in powers of the velocity of the
signal source, namely powers of v/c; the initial derivation
for gravitational waves was done to 3/2 post-Newtonian
order. This post-Newtonian method had been introduced
by Chandrasekhar (1965) to derive hydrodynamics equa-
tions in general relativity. The method was then applied
to a system of two masses for circular orbits, gravita-
tional bremsstrahlung, and head-on collisions (Wagoner
and Will, 1976). And so began the derivation of gravita-
tional wave solutions for the inspiral phase of binary sys-
tems, to higher and higher post-Newtonian order. Soon
2.5 post-Newtonian solutions were presented in Damour
and Deruelle (1981) and Itoh et al. (2001), and then
3.0 (Blanchet, 1998). The eﬀects from the spin of the
masses must be addressed, and have been included in
the post-Newtonian waveforms; these include spin-orbit
and spin-spin coupling. Post-Newtonian waveforms up
to order 4.0 have been derived. For an excellent and
comprehensive review of post-Newtonian descriptions of

gravitational wave signals see Blanchet (2014).

1. Compact Binary Parameter Estimation

After the initial proposal by Christensen and Meyer
(1998) to use MCMC methods for Bayesian gravitational
wave data analysis, these parameter estimation meth-
ods were then tested by Christensen and Meyer (2001)
with 2.5 order post-Newtonian waveforms as expressed in
the frequency domain (Tanaka and Tagoshi, 2000). The
MCMC was implemented with a Gibbs sampler (Gilks
et al., 1996). This initial demonstration considered the
data from one detector, and ﬁve parameters: the two
masses, the time and phase at coalescence, and a signal
amplitude. The demonstration was also concerned with
displaying rapid and eﬃcient sampling from a complex
posterior distribution for the steps of the Gibbs sam-
pler; this was accomplished with a Metropolized type of
adaptive rejection sampling (Gilks et al., 1995; Gilks and
Wild, 1992).

These MCMC methods were then expanded by Chris-
tensen et al. (2004a) with the use of a Metropolis-
Hastings MCMC (Hastings, 1970; Metropolis et al.,
1953). This was again a demonstration for a single de-
tector and a signal described by ﬁve parameters (Tanaka
and Tagoshi, 2000), also with the 2.5 post-Newtonian
waveforms of Tanaka and Tagoshi (2000). The code was
developed to be compatible with LIGO data and data
analysis. Starting with initial LIGO’s second science run,
S2, these MCMC parameter estimation methods were
applied to signals injected into the data (Abbott et al.,
2005). Further improvements to this initial method also
involved the development of importance resampling (Gel-
man et al., 2014; Smith and Gelfand, 1992) to improve
the convergence of the Markov chains, and informative
priors to better correspond to the expected conditions ex-
pected with LIGO and Virgo observations (R¨over et al.,
2006).

The application of Bayesian parameter estimation for
gravitational wave signals observed by a network of detec-
tors was demonstrated in R¨over et al. (2007a). This was
a presentation of a MCMC routine for coherent parame-
ter estimation for binary compact objects with multiple
interferometric gravitational wave detectors, for example
the three detectors in the LIGO-Virgo network. This
increased the number of parameters to nine, including
the distance and sky position; spin was neglected in this
initial study. As described in Sec. III (see Eq. 6), for
interferometer k, the likelihood function takes the form

L(k)(θ)

(cid:26)

∝
exp

1
T

−

(˜d(k)

−

˜h(k)(θ))∗S(k)−1

(˜d(k)

(cid:27)

˜h(k)(θ))

−

where the detector data is d(k), which is the sum of the
detector noise and the gravitational wave signal h(k)(θ),

20

c

which is described by the parameters θ. The Fourier
transforms of the data ˜d(k) and ˜h(k)(θ), appear in the
likelihood along with the noise PSD S(k). The parame-
ters θ(k) that describe the signal in detector k are: masses
m1 and m2; luminosity distance DL; inclination angle
ι; coalescence phase φ0; polarization ψ; and detector-
speciﬁc parameters: local coalescence time t(k)
; local sky
altitude ϑ(k); and local sky azimuth ϕ(k). Making the
assumption that the noise in the detectors is indepen-
dent, the product of the individual likelihoods gives the
network likelihood, Eq. 6. The study of R¨over et al.
(2007a) implemented a prior for the gravitational signal
amplitude that considerd the combined eﬀects of the dis-
tance and masses, which was then multiplied by the prior
for the inclination and sky position. For this study the
MCMC was implemented as a Metropolis-sampler (Gel-
man et al., 2014; Gilks et al., 1996). With the large num-
ber of parameters simulated annealing was used to better
sample the parameter space. This study demonstrated
eﬀects that are important for present LIGO-Virgo ob-
servations, especially GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017f).
There is a correlation between the estimation of the lu-
minosity distance dL and the inclination angle ι. Also,
if the signal strength (SNR) in a particular detector is
small it still adds information and can improve the sky
position localization. Again, this was what was observed
with GW170817 where the signal was weak in Virgo, yet
the inclusion of the Virgo data in the parameter esti-
mation improved the sky position estimation and was
crucial for identifying the source via electromagnetic ob-
servations (Abbott et al., 2017).

The multi-detector, coherent MCMC for gravitational
wave signals from compact binary systems was further
expanded and presented in R¨over et al. (2007b). Here a
more advanced waveform model was used that was 3.5
post-Newtonian order in phase and 2.5 order in ampli-
tude (Arun et al., 2004; Blanchet et al., 2002). This study
used sophisticated MCMC methods for the Metropo-
lis sampler, such as evolutionary MCMC (Liang and
Wong, 2001), a generalization motivated by genetic algo-
rithms (Goldberg, 1989). These methods yielded an en-
hancement over parallel tempering, with faster and more
dependable convergence toward the correct posterior dis-
tribution.

The natural evolution of the parameter estimation for
compact binary coalescence produced gravitational wave
signals was the inclusion of spin for the two initial compo-
nent masses. In the work of van der Sluys et al. (2008a,b)
the ﬁrst step in this process was to consider a neutron
star (1.4M
) binary; the black hole
is assumed to be spinning while the spin of the neutron
star can be ignored. This brings the total number of
parameters considered to 12. Such a parameter estima-
tion routine is demanding due to the sizable parameter
number and large correlations between them; this cre-
ates a parameter space with much structure. The wave-

) – black hole (10M

(cid:12)

(cid:12)

form used was 1.5 post-Newtonian in phase, but New-
tonian order in amplitude; in this way the signal could
be computed analytically, which was convenient for this
initial demonstration with large parameter number. The
spin of the black hole can couple with the orbital an-
gular momentum (an analogy to atomic spin-orbit cou-
pling); this will lead to modulation of the signal ampli-
tude and phase. In addition, such coupling will create a
precession of the orbital plane (Apostolatos et al., 1994).
However, the modulations in the observed signal can ac-
tually beneﬁt the parameter estimation and sometimes
remove parameter degeneracies. While the MCMC was
running, the correlations between the Markov chains for
the diﬀerent parameters were measured. The covariance
matrix was calculated. The subsequent samples for the
Markov chains were then drawn from the new multivari-
ate normal distribution. This increased the eﬃciency of
the MCMC. Parallel tempering was also employed. The
study showed that for reasonable SNRs, the sky position
of the source could be estimated to tens of square de-
grees, thereby displaying the potential for gravitational
wave multimessenger astronomy. The subsequent study
of Raymond et al. (2009) demonstrated that the use of
high post-Newtonian templates with spin provided im-
proved sky position estimation. The application of the
12 parameter MCMC was successfully demonstrated for
hardware-injected signals in the LIGO S5 data, thereby
showing the eﬃcacy of the method in the presence of real
interferometer detector noise (van der Sluys et al., 2009).
The parameter estimation for a compact binary coa-
lescence where the spin of both component masses is con-
sidered is presented in Raymond et al. (2010). For this
the total number of parameters is 15. Parallel tempering
is again used for the MCMC (R¨over et al., 2007a). For
the study the waveform was 3.5 post-Newtonian order in
phase, Newtonian amplitude, and spin related terms that
are 2.5 post-Newtonian order in phase; these are wave-
forms in the adiabatic circular orbit inspiral regime that
are driven by radiation reaction (Buonanno et al., 2003).
Signals were injected into synthetic Gaussian noise and
also actual LIGO data. These injected signals had an
SNR of 11.3, and with that accurate parameter estima-
tion was achieved. This study also made the comparison
between injected signals and short duration noise tran-
sients, glitches. Bayes factors were calculated for the
comparison between the model where a signal is present,
as compared to just Gaussian noise. A harmonic mean
method was used for the calculation of the evidence, and
hence the Bayes factor (Newton and Raftery, 1994), see
also III.C.

The possibilities for Bayesian parameter estimation for
compact binary coalescence produced gravitational wave
signals was greatly expanded with the important paper of
Veitch and Vecchio (2010) which introduced nested sam-
pling as a possible method for use. Nested sampling, de-
scribed in Sec. III, oﬀers a parameter estimation method

21

that is potentially faster than MCMC. This is important
for signals with a large number of parameters, such as
the 15 parameters associated from compact binary coa-
lescence. In addition to the generation of posterior prob-
abability functions for the parameters, the study also
addresses model selection and the generation of Bayes
factors. Nested sampling and MCMC both became inte-
gral for the LIGO-Virgo parameter estimation software
LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015), which is described in
Sec. X.A.

2. Compact Binary Waveform Modeling

As demonstrated by the observations of numerous bi-
nary black hole produced gravitational wave signals by
LIGO and Virgo (Abbott et al., 2019b, 2021d), it is crit-
ical to have a model for more than just the inspiral part
of the signal. The decades of work on the development
of waveform models that include the merger and ring-
down of the newly formed black hole have become es-
sential in this era where gravitational waves from binary
black holes are commonly observed and accurate param-
eter estimation is required (Mandel et al., 2014). The
limitations of the post Newtonian expansion, in powers
of v/c, become evident in the ﬁnal few orbits of a binary
black hole as the relative velocity approaches the speed
of light. This is well illustrated in the observation of
GW150914, where the two black holes reached a relative
0.6 at merger (Abbott et al., 2016d).
velocity of v/c
In order to address the limitations of the post-Newtonian
approach, the Eﬀective One-Body (EOB) formalism was
developed (Buonanno and Damour, 1999, 2000; Damour
et al., 2000). The post-Newtonian expansion in powers of
v/c is replaced by a non-polynomial function of v/c that
addresses the non-perturbative characteristics of the true
signal (Damour, 2016). The EOB method was quickly
expanded to include spin for the initial component black
hole in Damour (2001).

∼

A critically important point in the development of
gravitational wave signal waveforms was the numerical
calculation of the ﬁnal orbit, the plunge and then the
ringdown from the newly formed black hole system; this
achievement was presented in Pretorius (2005). This
breakthrough motivated many groups to develop numer-
ous diﬀerent numerical solutions to general relativity and
the prediction of gravitational wave signals from binary
black hole systems. See for example, the works of Baker
et al. (2006), Lindblom et al. (2006), and Campanelli
et al. (2006). A subsequent important development was
the ability to combine analytical relativity with numeri-
cal relativity, as demonstrated by the work of Buonanno
et al. (2007). With this work numerical relativity com-
pleted EOB waveforms were constructed. This has subse-
quently led to the use of templates constructed via these
methods for use by LIGO and Virgo, see Taracchini et al.

(2014) and Ossokine et al. (2020).

The Numerical INjection Analysis (NINJA) project
was initiated in order to study the sensitivity of gravi-
tational wave analysis pipelines to numerical simulations
of waveforms. The Bayesian parameter estimation meth-
ods were used to help verify the validity of numerical
relativity waveforms as part of the NINJA project (Aasi
et al., 2014; Aylott et al., 2009; Cadonati et al., 2009).

A frequency domain phenomenological model for the
generation of gravitational wave signals has also been de-
veloped and used by LIGO and Virgo (Khan et al., 2016;
Pratten et al., 2021). The phenomenological models use a
combination of analytic post-Newtonian and EOB meth-
ods to describe the inspiral, merger and ringdown. Nu-
merical relativity simulations are then used to calibrate
EOB coeﬃcients that could not be deﬁned otherwise,
and also free parameters associated with the merger and
ringdown. These models have considered a spin-aligned
conﬁguration where the black holes spins are parallel to
the orbital angular momentum. However, they have also
been extended to account for in-plane spin and orbital
precession by twisting up non-precessing waveforms to
simulate the precessional motion via the addition of one
parameter, the eﬀective precession spin parameter χp, as
described in (Hannam et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2015).
the ﬁrst detected gravitational wave signal
GW150914 (Abbott et al., 2016d) the waveforms that
were used for the parameter estimation included the nu-
merical relativity completed EOB waveforms (P¨urrer,
2014; Taracchini et al., 2014), as well as the phenomeno-
logical model with aligned spin (Khan et al., 2016; Prat-
ten et al., 2021). A phenomenological model that in-
cluded spin precession was also used (Hannam et al.,
2014). The analysis was redone in order to correct a
transformation of coordinates relating the nonprecess-
ing and precessing systems; this analysis used the spin
aligned EOB waveforms and the precessing phenomeno-
logical waveforms, and produced parameter estimates
equivalent to the initial study (Abbott et al., 2016e).
Finally, a revised and improved analysis using fully pre-
cessing waveforms (EOB and phenomenological) was pre-
sented in Abbott et al. (2016g).

For

Even from his orginal calculations, Einstein knew that
gravitational waves would be at least quadrupolar (Ein-
stein, 1918). But just like electromagnetic radiation
(where the lowest multipole radiation is dipole), it is pos-
sible to have higher order multipoles. For gravitational
waves, extensions past quadrupolar multipole moments
are what are referred to as higher-multipole emission.
Note that the presence of higher order modes and preces-
sion does not actually increase the number of physical pa-
rameters to estimate; it is just a more accurate waveform.
Higher multipoles will be detectable in gravitational wave
signals observed from compact binary systems with large
inclination angles, hence the absence of the higher mul-
tipoles would allow for the exclusion of those large an-

22

gles. This can break the orbital plane inclination angle
– distance degeneracy, which will then improve the con-
straints on the inferred source inclination and luminosity
distance (Chatziioannou et al., 2019b).

The recent O3 observations by Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo have displayed more complicated signals
that have shown the importance of having more complex
waveforms that encompass higher multipoles and orbital
precession. The binary systems responsible for the grav-
itational wave signals GW190412 (Abbott et al., 2020g)
and GW190814 (Abbott et al., 2020i) had larger mass
ratios, and the presence of higher multipoles was con-
ﬁrmed. For GW190412 (Abbott et al., 2020g) the system
was a binary black hole with initial component masses es-
timated to be m1 = 29.7+5.0
and m2 = 8.4+1.8

(folded to [0, π/2]) was estimated to be θJN = 0.73+0.34

Between the large mass ratio and the relatively large in-
clination angle it should not be a surprise that there was
evidence for higher order modes, as given by a log10 Bayes
3. The estimate for the orbital precession was
factor
≥
χp = 0.30+0.19
0.15, not providing strong evidence. Numerous
waveforms were used that incorporated higher multipole
modes and orbital precession. These include EOB wave-
forms which are created by doing an analytical inspiral-
merger-ringdown description that are based on post-
Newtonian, black-hole perturbation theory, numerical-
relativity results; see Pan et al. (2014), Babak et al.
(2017) and Ossokine et al. (2020). There were also the
phenomenological waveforms which included higher mul-
tipoles with no precession (London et al., 2018), or with
precession (Khan et al., 2019, 2020); further advances
have been implemented with the IMRPhenomXHM mod-
els (Garc´ıa-Quir´os et al., 2020, 2021).
In addition, a
numerical relativity surrogate model with higher multi-
pole modes, but only with spin aligned with the angu-
lar momentum (Varma et al., 2019b), was used to ver-
ify the parameter estimation results for GW190412 (Ab-
bott et al., 2020g). A similar analysis, with compara-
ble results, was conducted for GW190814 (Abbott et al.,
2020i). The binary black hole system that produced this
signal also had a large mass ratio: m1 = 23.2+1.1
and

m2 = 2.59+0.08
0.009. There was also
a relatively large inclination angle of θJN = 0.8+0.3

Finally, the very massive (total mass of 150M

) bi-
nary black hole merger signal, GW190521 (Abbott et al.,
2020h,j), shows some evidence of orbital precession. As
such it was necessary to have waveforms that accounted
for this eﬀect. And while GW190521 did not show
evidence for the presence of higher order modes, it is
important to also have these eﬀects in the waveforms
too. For the analysis of GW190521, the LIGO and
Virgo used the numerical relativity surrogate model NR-
Sur7dq4 (Varma et al., 2019a), the eﬀective-one-body

model SEOBNRv4PHM (Babak et al., 2017; Ossokine
et al., 2020) and the phenomenological model IMRPhe-
nomPv3HM (Khan et al., 2020). See Section VI.B.4 for
more discussion about this event.

B. Binary Neutron Star

The gravitational waves from a neutron star binary are
diﬀerent to those of a binary black hole. The potential
of inducing tidal deformations in the neutron stars must
be included; see the discussion in Sec. VI.C.1 and Eq. 36.
This was the case for the analysis of GW170817 (Abbott
et al., 2017f). As the orbital frequency increases, the
neutron star tidal eﬀects begin to aﬀect the phase and
become signiﬁcant for orbital frequencies above about
300 Hz; these eﬀects could be observable in the gravi-
tational wave signal (Hinderer et al., 2010). These tidal
deformations produce a mass-quadrupole moment that
will advanced the coalescence (Flanagan and Hinderer,
2008). The initial analysis of GW170817 used waveforms
incorporating the eﬀects of spin aligned with the orbital
angular momentum (Boh´e et al., 2013), spin-spin interac-
tions (Boh´e et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2016), and tidal in-
teractions (Dietrich et al., 2019; Nagar et al., 2018; Vines
et al., 2011). Subsequent analysis of GW170817 used
waveforms that incorporated diﬀerent theoretical predic-
tions for the equation of state of the neutron stars (Ab-
bott et al., 2020d), and also potential coupling between
p and g modes from within neutron stars (Abbott et al.,
2019a). See also Abbott et al. (2019c) for more details
on GW170817.

C. Neutron Star - Black Hole Binary

(cid:12)

The gravitational waves from a neutron star - black
hole binary will encode the large disparity between the
masses, with the neutron star mass being around 2M
(cid:12)
or less, and the black hole mass of course being uncon-
strained. This will allow for the presence of higher or-
der modes to be observable in the waveform.
In addi-
tion, if the black hole mass is not too large, possibly
10M
as an upper limit, then tidal distortion of the
neutron star could be observable before the merger. As
such, LIGO and Virgo will use waveforms that incorpo-
rate tidal eﬀects (Matas et al., 2020; Nagar et al., 2018;
Thompson et al., 2020), similar to the situation for bi-
nary neutron stars, as described in Sec. V.C. Recently
LIGO and Virgo announced the discovery gravitational
waves coming from two neutron star - black hole merg-
ers, GW200105 and GW200115 (Abbott et al., 2021e).
These events will be futher discussed in Sec. VI.D.1.

VI. DETECTIONS OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES BY
LIGO AND VIRGO

In this section we review the detection of gravitational
waves made by LIGO and Virgo to date, and describe the
use of parameter estimation methods to extract physical
information. LIGO and Virgo have announced the detec-
tion of 11 gravitational wave events during O1 and O2,
ten from binary black hole mergers and one from a bi-
nary neutron star merger (Abbott et al., 2019b). These
events have provided numerous opportunities to use pa-
rameter estimation methods to extract physics informa-
tion, test general relativity, and predict the expansion of
the universe and the population of compact binary sys-
tems. LIGO and Virgo have recently announced another
39 gravitational wave events from compact binary merg-
ers in catalog GWTC-2 (Abbott et al., 2021d). GWTC-
2 includes gavitational-wave events from the ﬁrst half of
O3, namely the events from O3a. The observation of two
neutron star - black hole coalescenses by LIGO and Virgo
have recently been announce (Abbott et al., 2021e).

A. Interferometer Calibration

Before starting with a detected signal one must ﬁrst
take into account the calibration of the gravitational wave
detectors, and the associated uncertainty on the calibra-
tion parameters. The calibration of Advanced LIGO is
explained in detail in Abbott et al. (2017b); Cahillane
et al. (2017); Sun et al. (2020), and for Advanced Virgo
in Acernese et al. (2018). These calibration uncertainties
will ultimately aﬀect the parameter estimation routines
that are attempting to extract the physical parameters
associated with the detected gravitational wave signals.
Clearly the gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and
Virgo are complicated instruments, and hence the cal-
ibration of their sensitivity to gravitational waves is a
necessary but diﬃcult procedure.

Interestingly MCMC methods are used to conduct the
statistical analysis on the LIGO interferometer response
functions. The detector parameters used for constructing
a strain signal from the phase changes in the interferom-
eter light and the servo-loop signals controlling the in-
terferometer performance are estimated with an MCMC.
From this analysis the ultimate uncertainties in the cali-
bration are extracted (Cahillane et al., 2017).

A clear and brief presentation of errors in the calibra-
tion of gravitational wave detectors and how they will
aﬀect parameter estimation can be found in Farr et al.
(2015). Following their explanation, a gravitational wave
of amplitude ˜h(f ) (as expressed in the frequency domain)
arrives at the detector. The data for the recorded signal,
˜d(f ), is

˜d(f ) = ˜hobs(f ) + ˜n(f ) ,

(30)

where ˜n(f ) is the noise in the detector, while ˜hobs(f ) is
the apparent gravitational wave signal observed by the
detector. There are always unavoidable uncertainties in
the calibration of the detectors. A way of expressing this
is through the frequency dependent uncertainty in the
calibration of the magnitude of the gravitational wave
signal, δA(f ), and the phase uncertainty, δφ(f ). These
uncertainties are frequency dependent, but the assump-
tion is that they are also continuous as a function of
frequency. One can then express the observered gravita-
tional wave signal with respect to the real gravitational
wave impinging on the detector as

˜hobs(f ) = ˜h(f ) (1 + δA(f )) eiδφ(f ) .

(31)

There will be diﬀerent calibration uncertainties for the
diﬀerent detectors. The calibration uncertainties are not
large; for example, for the time of the GW150914 detec-
tion, LIGO reported calibration uncertainties of less than
10% in magnitude and 10o in phase for the frequency
band 20 Hz to 1 kHz (Abbott et al., 2017b). It is also the
case that when the observing run ends LIGO and Virgo
re-do their calibration, which often results in diminish-
ing the uncertainties. For the O1 and O2 gravitational
wave observations reported in Abbott et al. (2019b) the
ﬁnal calibration uncertainties were 3.8% for magnitude
and 2.1o in phase for LIGO Livingston, 2.6% for magni-
tude and 2.4o for LIGO Hanford, and 5.1% for magni-
tude and 2.3o for Virgo. In the study Farr et al. (2015)
an approximation for the phase terms is introduced that
will simplify the actual computer based computations,
namely

eiδφ

∼

2 + iδψ(f )
iδψ(f )
2

−

,

(32)

and the phase term δψ(f ) is used instead.

A spline interpolation is used to model the calibra-
tion errors, and this is the method currently used for
LIGO-Virgo parameter estimation studies with LALIn-
fernece (Veitch et al., 2015). At the nodes for the splines,
fi, are the magnitude errors, δAi, and phase errors, δψi.
The nodal points are selected to be distributed uniformly
in log f . There are posterior probability distribution
functions generated for the calibration errors at the nodal
points, and this is done as part of the overall param-
eter estimation calculation along with the physical pa-
rameters of the gravitational wave source. This calibra-
tion uncertainty procedure is conducted independently
for each of the gravitational wave detectors. Calibra-
tion uncertainty is also modeled in a similar way with
Bilby (Romero-Shaw et al., 2020).

With the small uncertainties it is reasonable to use
a prior distribution that is Gaussion for the calibration
uncertainties, namely,

p(δAi) = N (0, σAi) ,

(33)

and

24

p(δψi) = N (0, σψi) ,

(34)

and the σs are the calibration uncertainties. The prior
distributions for the calibration uncertainties are then
used as part of the parameter estimation process, and
for example, are part of the parameter estimation rou-
tines in LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015). When esti-
mating the physical parameters of a gravitational wave
source one marginalizes over these calibration uncertain-
ties (Farr et al., 2015). Note that the absolute timing ac-
curacy of data between the detectors, 10 µs, is so small
that its potential contribution to aﬀects on parameter
estimation are much less than those of the calibration
uncertainty (Abbott et al., 2017b).

The study of Payne et al. (2020) applied a calibration
model that was physically motivated and then used it as
part of a comprehensive inference strategy for compact
binary mergers. In order to make the analysis more ef-
ﬁcient importance sampling was applied. Events from
LIGO-Virgo catalog GWTC-1 (Abbott et al., 2019b)
were analyzed. It was found that the estimation of the
calibration error was not the limiting factor for the esti-
mation of the physical parameters from the gravitational
wave signals.

While the current LIGO and Virgo calibration strate-
gies involve injecting electrical signals at appropriate
parts of the control system, or using photon actuators
to push the mirrors, new gravitational methods are cur-
rently under investigation. In the studies of Estevez et al.
(2018, 2021) spinning masses were used to conduct a
Newtonian calibration of Virgo. This initial demonstra-
tion of Newtonian calibration gave results consistent with
the standard calibration results of Virgo, however more
work is necessary to reduce noise with this method. In
the study of Essick and Holz (2019) the authors use the
belief in the correctness of general relativity, the relative
amplitude and phase measurements of the gravitational
wave in multiple detectors, and external electromagnetic
observations that provide constraints on the distance to
the source and angle of inclination of the orbital plane
through the information from the jet observation. The
study was able to show, using Bayesian parameter esti-
mation methods (Veitch et al., 2015), that with the obser-
vations of GW170817 one could calibrate the amplitude
calibration of the LIGO detectors to
15% for
the phase (Essick and Holz, 2019). Accurate calibration
will also have important implications for measuring the
Hubble constant with gravitational waves from compact
binary mergers; in fact, gravitational wave sources can
themselves be used to help calibrate the detectors (Schutz
and Sathyaprakash, 2020).

B. Binary Black Holes

When the ﬁrst detection was made, GW150914 (Ab-
bott et al., 2016d), it truly was the birth of a new type
of astronomy. Since the time of Galileo, every time a
new type of telescope has been used new and often un-
expected discoveries have been made. This was certainly
the case with the ﬁrst detected gravitational wave sig-
nal, GW150194. The two LIGO detectors simultaneously
detected this signal at 09:50:45 UTC on September 14,
2015. Since then LIGO and Virgo have detected a fur-
ther 49 gravitational wave signals from compact binaries,
with the majority being binary black holes, during O1,
O2 and O3a, with even more coming from the O3b (ﬁ-
It is informative to
nal 5 months of O3) observations.
start with how much was learned from the ﬁrst event
alone, especially through the use of parameter estima-
tion methods.

1. GW150914

GW150914, the ﬁrst detection of a gravitational waves,
was made right at the beginning of the ﬁrst observational
run for Advanced LIGO. The signal was conﬁdently de-
tected with 24 for the SNR and 1 event in 203 000 years
for the false alarm rate (Abbott et al., 2016d).

The ﬁrst important result from parameter estimation
would be the sky position estimate. By providing a pos-
sible location for the source it is possible for other ob-
servers (electromagnetic radiation, high energy neutri-
nos) to look for a counterpart signal. The simplest way
to create a sky map is to use the diﬀerence in the ar-
rival times of the signal in the diﬀerent detectors. For
GW150914 the time delay of 6.9+0.5
0.4 ms between the Liv-
ingston and Hanford detectors produced a location patch
in the sky. This is what is typical done with the signal
search pipelines. However, Bayesian parameter estima-
tion routines take into account the nature of the signal as
deﬁned by the model, and also consider the response of
the diﬀerent interferometric detectors to the polarization
state of the gravitational wave.

For GW150914 there was an initial sky position es-
timate released 2 days after the event that reported
200 deg2 in size, and a
a 50% credible region of
750 deg2 (LIGO Scientiﬁc Collabora-
90% region of
tion and Virgo Collaboration, 2015). This initial cir-
culation used the output of two signal search routines,
Coherent WaveBurst (Klimenko et al., 2016) and Omi-
cron+LALInference Burst (Lynch et al., 2017). Coher-
ent WaveBurst conducts a limited maximum likelihood
(using the antenna response of the detectors’) estimate
of the reconstructed signal on a grid of the sky, while
Omicron+LALInference Burst makes the assumption of
a sinusoidally modulated Gaussian signal and then uses
Bayesian inference. On January 16, 2016, some 4 months

lination δ in degrees) probability distribution function for the
position of the source of GW150914 on the sky. The 50%
and 90% contours of the for the credible regions are given.
This probability distribution function was made with LAL-
Inference (Veitch et al., 2015), which is futher described in
Sec. X.A. See (Abbott et al., 2016e) for more details.

after the event, LIGO and Virgo released an update to
the sky position estimate (LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration
and Virgo Collaboration, 2016). This new sky position
estimate used LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015), which
is further described in Sec. X.A, and BAYESTAR (Singer
and Price, 2016), which is further described in Sec. X.G.
The BAYESTAR sky maps are made using the infor-
mation from the signal search pipelines: merger times,
signal amplitudes, and signal phases. The LALInference
sky map was created from Bayesian MCMC and Nested
Sampling analyses, and was considered to be the most
accurate sky map, at the expense of the computational
time. The LALInference sky map for GW150914 has
a 90% credible region of 630 deg2. See (Abbott et al.,
2016c) for a full description of the methods used to pro-
duce the sky position estimates for GW150914, and the
eﬀorts that were subsequently done by astronomical ob-
servers to try and ﬁnd a counterpart. Note that the sky
localization for GW150914 was later improved from 230
deg2 due to improved calibration uncertainty (Abbott
et al., 2016b). This also improved the inclination esti-
mation. See Abbott et al. (2019b) for the most recent
estimates of the parameters. Fig. 6 displays the LALIn-
ference generated sky map for GW150914.

While numerous observing systems looked for a coun-

terpart signal, there was only one possible associated ob-
servation. Fermi/GBM reported a possible gamma ray
event of energy above 50 keV of duration 1 s that oc-
curred 0.4 s after the GW150914 merger time, with a
false-alarm probability of 0.0022. The sky location deter-
mination for the gamma ray event was not well localized
but was consistent with part of the gravitational wave lo-
calization from the Advanced LIGO (Connaughton et al.,
2016). This observation was not conﬁrmed by other ob-
servers.

26

In addition to the right ascension and declination, the
distance to the source is another critical parameter in
the attempt to locate a gravitational wave source. How-
ever, there is a degeneracy between the luminosity dis-
tance, and the angle of incidence for the orbital plane
of the binary system. If the normal to the orbital plane
points directly to the observer, then the amplitude of
the gravitational wave signal will be bigger, mimicking a
closer source. As the angle between the normal to the
orbital plane and the line of sight of the observer de-
parts from 0 to π/2 radians, the amplitude diminishes,
mimicking a source farther away. This eﬀect and its im-
plications for parameter estimation is explained in R¨over
et al. (2007a,b). The parameter estimation results for
GW150914, as generated by LALInference, produce pos-
terior distribution functions for the luminosity distance
and the orbital plane inclination that can be seen in
Fig. 7. The source of GW150914 was evidently at a dis-
tance of 410+160
0.04 (Abbott
et al., 2016e) using the Planck’s estimated cosmology pa-
rameters (Ade et al., 2016).

For a binary black hole merger the information on the
inclination of the orbital plane does not oﬀer much use-
ful information. However, for binary neutron stars, or
a black hole - neutron star binary, there could be a jet
produced, and the subsequent gamma ray observations
would depend on that angle (Burns, 2020). The impor-
tance of the orbital plane inclination angle for binary
neutron star mergers will be addressed in Sec. VI.C.1.

The masses for the binary system that produced
GW150914 were critical in explaining the nature of the
initial and ﬁnal objects. From the character of the
signal it appeared that the objects were point masses,
and parameter estimation provided the estimate of the
masses of the two intial objects to be m1 = 36+5

and m2 = 29+5
(Abbott et al., 2016d,e). The poste-

rior distribution functions for the two initial masses can
be seen in Fig. 2. Note that for the initial analysis of
GW150914 the prior distribution for each initial compo-
nent masses was uniform between 10 and 80 M
(Abbott
et al., 2016e). The amplitude of GW150914 reached a
maximum at about 150 Hz, which implies that the or-
bital frequency of the binary system was about 75 Hz.

initial component masses are far
in excess of what is possible for a neutron star. Also, a
pair of stars would not sustain their spherical shapes and
act like point particles, and in fact, would be far larger
than this implied separation distance. The only reason-
able explanation, aside from exotic and new physics, is
that these two masses are black holes. This is further
supported by the fact that the full general relativistic
analysis of this merger is consistent with point particles
meeting together at a relative velocity of
0.6c (Abbott
et al., 2016d). Further support for the black hole hypoth-
esis also comes from the merger and ringdown part of the
signal, which is further discussed below in the context of
tests of general relativity in Sec. VII.

The angular momentum components of the system are
also critically important parameters to estimate, as they
might provide some clues to the formation history of the
black holes. As described above, the parameter estima-
tion routines for LIGO-Virgo estimate the initial spins of
the component black holes, and with the orbital angular
momentum, an estimate of the spin of the remnant black
hole is also estimated. GW150914 provided the ﬁrst mea-
surement of the spin of black holes, although not all the
information can be extracted for a signal of ﬁnite SNR,
and observable only for a limited time in the observation
frequency band of the detectors.

LIGO and Virgo use two diﬀerent models for the co-
alescing compact binary parameter estimation with spin
for the initial masses. The simpler model only consid-
ers the spin of the initial masses to be aligned or anti-
aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector. As
such, for circular orbits this model consists of 11 param-
eters describing the physical system. When the spin di-
rections for the initial masses can be in any direction
it is possible to induce precession of the spins and the
orbital plane. This more complex mode has 15 parame-
ters for circular orbits. The non-precessing analysis used
an eﬀective-one-body model (Taracchini et al., 2014) that
was adjusted in consideration of numerical relativity sim-
ulation results (Mroue et al., 2013). These were the con-
siderations for the initial parameter estimation analysis
of GW150914 (Abbott et al., 2016e).

The initial analysis of the Advanced LIGO GW150914
data showed that there was no appreciable spin for the
two initial black holes; however, the posteriors for the
spins are essentially uninformative. The mass weighted
linear combination of the initial spins aligned with the
orbital angular momentum was estimated to be χeﬀ =
0.17, consistent with zero, but slightly negative.
−
The posterior distribution for the eﬀective in-plane spin
parameter essentially corresponds to the prior, and hence
a 90% constraint of χp < 0.71 is set. Estimates were
made on the total spins of the initial black holes: χ1 =
0.32+0.49

2016e). See Fig. 8 for a summary of the posterior distru-
bution functions for the initial spins, and Fig. 9 for the
posterior distributions for the ﬁnal mass and ﬁnal spin of
the remnant black hole.

χ1 and χ2. For the nonprecessing spin model the prior is
such, with that the initial black hole spin vectors could
be aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular mo-
mentum vector, with magnitudes between 0 and 1. For
the precessing spins model the initial spin angular mo-
mentum priors are uniform across all directions, again
with spin magnitudes between 0 and 1 (Abbott et al.,
2016e).

Subsequent analyses of GW150914 continue to show
that the spin parameters for the two initial black holes
are not large, and that the inclusion of precession in the
model does not aﬀect the results. There is no indica-
tion of precession for GW150914 (Abbott et al., 2019b,
2017a).

Tests of general relativity have been made with
GW150914. General relativity should describe every-
thing about the merger of a binary black hole system,
from the orbital inspiral, to the merger of the two black
holes, and then the ringdown of the newly formed black
hole. A test has been done to subtract the most proba-
ble waveform from the gravitational wave data, using the
procedure described in Sec. VII.A. After the subtraction
of the waveform the residuals from the two LIGO data
streams are more probable to represent Gaussian noise
than residual gravitational wave energy (Abbott et al.,
2016f, 2019f, 2020c). A comparison was done for the es-
timation of the ﬁnal black hole mass and spin, using the
data from the inspiral part of the signal (low frequency),
and then the data from the merger and ringdown (high
frequency). Fig. 10 presents a display of the 90% credible
regions for the ﬁnal spin and ﬁnal mass for the black hole
remnant for GW150914 using the low frequency (inspi-
ral) and high frequency (merger and ringdown) parts of
the signal.

for theoretical physics.

2. GW170814 and GW170818

The ﬁrst three-detector gravitational wave detection
GW170814, produced by a binary black hole merger, pro-
vided the ﬁrst opportunity to test whether the polariza-
tion of the gravitational waves was consistent with the
predictions of general relativity (Abbott et al., 2017e).
GW170818 was another gravitational wave from a binary
black hole merger that was detected with three detectors
with suﬃcient SNR to allow for a polarization test (Ab-

bott et al., 2016b). See Sec. VII.E for a description of
the methods used. For GW170814 the modal comparison
analysis gave a Bayes factor of 30 for tensor polarization
as opposed to vector polarization, and 220 for tensor ver-
sus scalar (Abbott et al., 2019f). With GW170818 there
was a Bayes factor of 12 for tensor polarization versus
vector, and 407 for tensor versus scalar (Abbott et al.,
2019f).

3. GW190412 and GW190814

The observations of GW190412 (Abbott et al., 2020g)
and GW190814 (Abbott et al., 2020i), both seen in ob-
serving run O3, displayed new and important eﬀects. All
three LIGO-Virgo detectors were in observational mode
for these two events. These two gravitational wave events
were produced from binary black hole systems where the
mass ratio for the initial constituent masses, q = m1/m2,
displays a signiﬁcant asymmetry. For GW190412 the pa-
rameter estimation gave m1 = 30.1+4.6
and m2 =
5.3M

for m2 with GW190814 has provoked much discussion
and research as it is not certain whether this object is a
black hole or a neutron star; it has even been proposed
that this could be a strange quark star (Bombaci et al.,
2021).

When such signiﬁcant mass ratios are present, it is
possible to observe the eﬀects of higher order multi-
poles, namely past the dominant quadrupole mode. One
can describe the emitted gravitational waves in terms
of a series of spin-wighted sperical harmonics (Thorne,
1980). For example, the two polarizations would take
the form (Abbott et al., 2020g)

tems the quadrupole l = m = 2 mode is expected to
dominate, but when the mass ratio becomes diﬀerent
from one the contribution of the l = m = 3 mode can
become important.

The waveforms used in the analyses accounted for both
orbital precession and higher order multiples. These were
the eﬀective-one-body numerical relativity waveform
SEOBNRv4PHM (Babak et al., 2017; Ossokine et al.,

rogate NRHybSur3dq8 model (for GW190412) which in-
cludes higher order multipoles (Varma et al., 2019a,b)..

As these two events displayed, signal models which in-

the parameters, especially the initial component masses.
Consequently, the waveforms used for parameter esti-
mation need to include these eﬀects. The Bayes fac-
tor,

tipoles to a pure quadrupole model in the waveforms,

for GW190814, where the evidence was more signiﬁcant,

of higher multipoles is suﬃciently strong for this event

the dominant higher order multipole, with log10 B
in support of the signal containg both the l = m = 2
and l = m = 3 multipole modes, as opposed to just the
quadrupole l = m = 2 alone. Further evidence for the
presence of the l = m = 3 mode in the GW190814 signal
can be found in Fig. 12 where the inferred SNR of this
mode is observed, whereas the inferred SNR for orbital
precession is not signiﬁcant (Fairhurst et al., 2020a,b).
For GW190412, an important result is that the eﬀective
spin parameter of the primary (most massive) black hole
primary can be measured, χeﬀ = 0.25+0.08
0.11. This is dis-
tinct from other events, and is discussed in detail in Zevin
et al. (2020). For GW190412 there was no evidence for
precession.

The observed GW190521 signal provides an indication
for the eﬀects of orbital precession. If the initial black
holes have signiﬁcant spin in the orbital plane there will
be an induced precession of the orbital plane; this is a
consequence of a gravitational spin-orbit coupling (Kid-
der, 1995). There was no evidence for higher order mul-
tipoles in the signal. However, it is still important to
include both orbital precession and higher order modes
in the waveforms because this can help to break the in-
clination angle – distance degeneracy and produce better
parameter estimates (Chatziioannou et al., 2019b). As
such, for the study of GW190521 the numerical relativ-
ity surrogate model NRSur7dq4 (Varma et al., 2019a)
was used in the LIGO-Virgo discovery presentation in
Abbott et al. (2020h). Two other waveforms, namely
the eﬀective-one-body model SEOBNRv4PHM (Babak
et al., 2017; Ossokine et al., 2020) and the phenomeno-
logical model IMRPhenomPv3HM (Khan et al., 2020),
were also used and gave consistent results, as presented
in Abbott et al. (2020j).

C. Binary Neutron Stars

The observation of gravitational waves from the merger
of a binary neutron star system provides numerous ad-
ditional scenarios over what can be done with the ob-
servation of a binary black hole system. Neutron stars
are made of matter. As such, with a binary neutron
star merger electromagnetic radiation will be emitted.
In fact, it has been theorized that a source for short
gamma ray bursts could be from binary neutron star
mergers (Berger, 2014).

Black holes essentially behave as point particles as they
spiral into one another in a binary merger, and while neu-
tron stars are incredibly dense, the tidal gravitational
ﬁeld will eventually distort the shape of the neutron
stars as they approach each other. The tidal gravita-
tional ﬁeld induces mass quadruple moments in the neu-
tron stars (Damour et al., 1992), and this has the eﬀect
of increasing the rate at which the binary system coa-
lesces (Flanagan and Hinderer, 2008). This eﬀect can be
calculated and incorporated into the waveform. As such,
it could be possible to extract information on the nuclear
equation of state from the observation of gravitational
waves from a binary neutron star merger (Chatziioan-
nou, 2020; Damour et al., 2012; Vines et al., 2011).

While it is likely that the end product of a binary neu-
tron star merger will be a black hole, it is possible that
some of the matter will be ejected from the collision, and
could be observable. This remnant is called a kilonova.
Rapid neutron capture would form heavy elements, and
with them being radioactive, the activity could be vis-
ible. This ejected material could also be the source of
heavy elements, such as gold and platinum, in the uni-
verse (Lattimer and Schramm, 1974; Metzger, 2020)

A unique feature about coalescing compact binary
gravitational wave signals is that it is possible to use
Bayesian inference to estimate the luminosity distance
to the source. If the redshift of the source can also be
measured then the expansion of the universe, or the Hub-
ble constant, could be measured (Nissanke et al., 2010;
Schutz, 1986). This would be a new and unique way to
measure the expansion of the universe, and very diﬀerent
from the use of cosmic microwave background data (Ade
et al., 2016; Christensen et al., 2001) or supernovae ob-
servations (Riess et al., 2016).

All of these eﬀects are of great importance for astro-
physics and fundamental physics. Hence there is tremen-
dous interest in observing gravitational waves and elec-
tromagnetic radiation from a binary neutron star merger.
Many of the studies necessitate ﬁnding the source, so this

1. GW170817

The birth of gravitational wave multimessenger as-
tronomy occured with the simultaneous observations of
a gravitational wave signal GW170817 (Abbott et al.,
2017f) followed 1.7s by the observation of the short
gamma ray burst GRB 170817A (Goldstein et al., 2017;
Savchenko et al., 2017). With the subsequent detection of
the kilonova counterpart (Coulter et al., 2017), the source
was observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, from
X-ray to radio (Abbott et al., 2017). This event provided
the means to study numerous important astrophysical
and fundamental physics eﬀects.

The success of GW170817 for multimessenger astron-
omy came from the ability to identify the location of the
source. The gravitational wave detection was not triv-
ial, however. A strong noise transient, a glitch, occured
during the time that the signal was being recorded at
LIGO Livingston, 1.1 s before the coalescence time. For
the initial rapid response the data containing the glitch
was removed with a Tukey window function. The SNR
was large in the data for LIGO Hanford and LIGO Liv-
ingston. The SNR in the Virgo data was relatively small,
however as noted in R¨over et al. (2007a), this is still infor-
mation that can be used in a parameter estimation rou-
tine to improve the localization of the source. The data
from all three gravitational wave detectors was crucial
for the signal source identiﬁcation. The rapid parameter
estimation routine BAYESTAR (Singer and Price, 2016)
(see also Sec. X.G) was able to estimate that position of
the source in the sky to 31 deg2, and an initial estimation
of the luminosity distance of 40
8 Mpc (LIGO Scien-
tiﬁc Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration, 2017). The sky
position estimation can be seen in Fig. 4. This is what
allowed for the location of the source to be identiﬁed in
the galaxy NGC 4993 10.9 hours after the detection of
the gravitational wave and the gamma ray burst (Coulter
et al., 2017).

In order to subsequently conduct eﬀective parameter
estimation, the glitch in the LIGO Livingston data was
modeled in time and frequency with wavelets, namely
with the BayesWave algorithm (Cornish and Littenberg,
2015) as described in Sec. IV.B, and then subtracted from
the data. Note that this event has subsequently pro-
voked the development of even more sophisticated tech-
niques in glitch subtraction (Pankow et al., 2018). The
waveform (Sathyaprakash and Dhurandhar, 1991) model
used for the Bayesian parameter estimation (Veitch et al.,
2015) incorporated the eﬀects of spin aligned with the
orbital angular momentum (Boh´e et al., 2013), spin-spin
interactions between the two initial masses (Boh´e et al.,

2015; Mishra et al., 2016), and tidal interactions on the
neutron stars (Bernuzzi et al., 2012; Vines et al., 2011).
With that the parameter estimation could report that
the initial component masses were consistent with what
are expected for neutron stars. However, there was some
dependency on the prior for the eﬀective spin parameter.
Assuming that the initial system had low spin the two ini-
tial masses were estimated to be in the range of 1.17 to 1.6

The parameter estimation for GW170817 considered
the possible distortion of the spherical shape of the neu-
tron stars from tidal forces. The tidal deformity is deﬁned

where R is the neutron star radius, m the mass, and k2
the second Love number, which is theorized to be in the
range of 0.05 to 0.15 for neutron stars (Hinderer et al.,
2010). The initial analysis constrained the tidal defor-
800 (Abbott et al., 2017f). A subequent
mity to Λ
analysis assumed that the equation of state for the two
neutron stars was the same, that the equation of state
could allow for neutron stars in excess of 1.97M
(to
be consistent with the observed mass of for the pulsar
(Antoniadis et al., 2013)), and
J0348+0432 of
that the spins of the neutron stars were consistent with
the observed spins of binary neutron stars in our galaxy.
With such assumptions LIGO and Virgo were able to pro-
duce the estimate of Λ = 190+390
120, as well as to estimate
the radii of the neutron stars to be 11.9+1.4
1.4 km (Abbott
et al., 2018a). LIGO and Virgo have used the gravita-
tional wave data for GW170817 and Bayesian parameter
estimation methods to investigate other characteristics
of the neutron stars and their equations of state (Abbott
et al., 2019a, 2020d).

The ability to measure the expansion rate of the
universe, the Hubble constant, was another signiﬁcant
byproduct of the observation of GW170817 and the
use of Bayesian parameter estimation routines on the
gravitational wave data. The ability to use gravita-
tional wave data to measure the Hubble constant was
a long anticipated reward for gravitatational wave astro-
physics (Schutz, 1986). Recall Eq. 25, v = H0D. The pa-
rameter estimation for a compact binary coalescence pro-
vides an estimate for the luminosity distance DL. How-
ever, the estimation of another parameter is correlated
with the distance, namely the angle of inclination of the
normal to the orbital plane of the system with respect to
the line of sight, ι. Variations in DL and ι both aﬀect the
amplitude of the detected gravitational wave, hence their
correlation when they are estimated. In order to gener-
ate a posterior probability distribution function for the

32

−

luminosity distance DL one must marginalize over the in-
clination angle ι which adds uncertainty to the distance
estimate. The Hubble constant parameter estimation ef-
fort was signiﬁcantly improved by the fact that the source
of GW170817 was found to be in the galaxy NGC 4993.
Because of this the two sky position parameters could
be ﬁxed, and with that constraint the distance was esti-
mated to be DL = 43.8+2.9
6.9 Mpc, where the error bars
correspond to the 68.3% credible interval. The velocity
of the source to the line of sight could be measured from
the observed velocity of NGC 4993; this is done via red-
shift measurements. An allowance was also made for the
peculiar velocity of NGC 4993 within its local cluster of
galaxies. With this the Hubble constant was estimated
to be H0 = 70+12
1, where again the er-
ror bars represent the 68.3% credible interval (Abbott
et al., 2017a). This measurement is independent of the
other methods used to measure the Hubble constant, but
the result is consistent. For example, measurements of
the cosmic microwave background data give the estimate
1 (Ade et al., 2016), while
1 Mpc−
H0 = 67.74
type Ia supernovae observations give H0 = 73.24
1.74
1 (Riess et al., 2016). LIGO and Virgo have
km s−
subsequently added binary black hole merger events and
information from galaxy catalogs to produce an estima-
tion of H0 = 69+17
1 (Abbott et al., 2021a).

This has also spurred other groups to use gravitational
wave data to estimate the Hubble constant (Finke et al.,

Binary neutron star mergers were thought to be a
source of short gamma ray bursts (Berger, 2014) with the
gamma rays ejected in a jet perpendicular to the orbital
plane of the binary, namely, parallel to the orbital angu-
lar momentum of the the system (Shibata et al., 2006).
Hence, the observation of the gamma rays and the esti-
mation of the observation angle with respect to the jet, ι,
will provide much important information for understand-
ing the formation of jets from the binary neutron star
mergers. GW170817 and GRB 170817A provided such
critical data (Abbott et al., 2017d). The gravitational
wave data indicate that the viewing angle to the source
is anti-alinged, namely the angular momentum vector of
the system is pointing away from us. The estimation
of the cosine of the inclination, cosι, is that it is con-
strained to the range [-1.00, -0.81], at 68.3% conﬁdence,
or equivalently [-144o, 180o] (Abbott et al., 2017f). The
Hubble constant question can also be inverted, namely to
use the previously determined Hubble constant measure-
ments as a prior and produce an improved estimate on
the inclination angle ι. Using the Hubble constant from
the cosmic microwave background measurement of the
Planck mission (Ade et al., 2016) the 68.3% conﬁdence
band for cosι is [-1.00, -0.92], or [157o, 177o] for the in-
clination angle ι. Using the supernova produced value
for the Hubble constant (Riess et al., 2016) the similar
constraints are [-0.97, -0.85] for cosι and [148o, 166o] for

ι (Abbott et al., 2017a). The parameter estimates for
GW170817 have been further updated in Abbott et al.
(2019b).

2. GW190425

69 Mpc, much farther than the

LIGO and Virgo have announced the detection of grav-
itational waves from another possible binary neutron star
merger GW190425 (Abbott et al., 2020a). This was
observed in the the third Advanced LIGO - Advanced
Virgo observing run, O3. The event was only conﬁdently
detected in the LIGO Livingston detector. Virgo was
taking data, but the SNR was too low for it to con-
tribute to the detection. LIGO Hanford was not on-
line during this event. As a consequence there was a
very large uncertainty in the sky position of the source,
8300 deg2. The luminosity distance was estimated to
∼
be 159+71
40 Mpc distance
for GW170817. Because of the large sky position uncer-
tainty and large distance, no electromagnetic counterpart
to GW190425 was observed. For the parameter estima-
tion a phenomenological waveform (Hannam et al., 2014)
is used, namely PhenomPv2NRT (Dietrich et al., 2019);
this model incorporates spin precession and tidal inter-
actions (Dietrich et al., 2017). We quote here the results
using the high-spin prior (dimensionless spin magnitudes
for the two initial neutron star of χ < 0.89). An inter-
esting consequence of the the observation of GW190425
was the relative large masses for what are assumed to be
a pair of neutron stars. The chirp mass was estimated to
, and total mass 3.4+0.3
be 1.44+0.02
; for compar-
(cid:12)
ison, GW170817 had, when also using a high-spin prior,
estimates for the chirp mass of 1.188+0.004
and to-
tal mass of 2.82+0.47
. For GW190425 no tidal eﬀects
were observed, and a limit for the combined dimension-
less tidal deformability was set at Λ < 1100 (Abbott
et al., 2020a).

LIGO and Virgo have detected gravitational waves
from two neutron star - black hole binary mergers (Ab-
bott et al., 2021e). These were both detected in Jan-
uary, 2020, during the second half of observing run O3
(O3b). GW200105 was detected at LIGO Livingston,
while LIGO Hanford was not observing; the SNR for the
event in Virgo was very low, implying that this was es-
sentially a single detector observation. Virgo data was
used for paramter estimation, yielding mass estimates
(low spin prior) of 8.9+1.1
(90% credible intervals)
1.3M
for the presumed black hole, and 1.9+0.2
for the pre-
sumed neutron star. The estimated luminosity distance
is 280+110
110 Mpc. GW200115 was detected by all three
LIGO-Virgo detectors. The mass estimates were (low
spin prior) are 5.9+1.4
for the presumed black hole,
and 1.4+0.6
for the presumed neutron star. The es-
0.2M
timated luminosity distance is 310+150
110 Mpc. No elec-
tromagnetic or neutrino counterpart to these events was
detected.

For parameter estimation pBilby was used (Smith
et al., 2020) (see Sec. X.C), as well as RIFT (Lange
et al., 2018) (see Sec. X.E).
In order to verify the re-
sults LALInference was also used (Veitch et al., 2015).
The primary parameter estimation analysis did not as-
sume that tidal eﬀects were present. The phenomenologi-
cal model IMRPhenomXPHM (Pratten et al., 2021) and
the EOBNR model SEOBNRv4PHM (Ossokine et al.,
2020) were used. These models included the eﬀects
of orbital precession and higher order modes, although
the presence of these eﬀects was not observed for either
event. The possible tidal deformation of the neutron
stars were investigated using models that include such an
eﬀect; these assume that spins are aligned with the or-
bital angular momentum. These are the phenomenologi-
cal IMRPhenomNSBH (Thompson et al., 2020) and the
EOBNR SEOBNRv4 ROM NRTidalv2 NSBH (Matas
et al., 2020) models. Tidal deformation was not observed.

D. Neutron Star – Black Hole Binaries

VII. TESTING GENERAL RELATIVITY

The merger of a neutron star - black hole binary is an-
other source of gravitational waves. These events are in-
teresting for a number of reasons. If the black hole is not
too massive the neutron star could be tidally disrupted
before crossing the event horizon (Stachie et al., 2021)
and could be a source of gamma rays (Berger, 2014; Stone
et al., 2013) or a kilonova (Foucart, 2020; Kawaguchi
et al., 2016; Metzger, 2020; Mochkovitch et al., 2021).
This could also provide information on the equation
of state for the neutron star material (Harry and Hin-
derer, 2018). The formation mechanisms for neutron
star - black hole binaries are also an important area of
study (Broekgaarden and Berger, 2021).

The observations of gravitational waves by LIGO and
Virgo now present a possibility to test general relativity
in a way that has never been possible before. The pa-
rameter estimation methods used to examine the grav-
itational wave signals are inherently model dependent.
For the analyses conducted by LIGO and Virgo the basic
assumption is that general relativity is correct. However
the same parameter estimation methods can be extended
to encompass alternatives to general relativity. The gen-
eral relativistic models can be extended and parameter
estimation can then be conducted, and if the additional
parameters produce non-zero estimates it could be evi-
dence for a violation of general relativity. Model com-

parison methods such as those described in Sec. III.C
can be applied directly between general relativity and
the alternative model. In this section we summarize the
methods used by LIGO and Virgo to test general rel-
ativity. We discuss the speciﬁc results in Sec. VI where
the summary of some of the observed results from LIGO-
Virgo parameter estimation are presented. The ﬁrst de-
tection, GW150914 (Abbott et al., 2016d), provided the
ﬁrst opportunity to conduct numerous tests of general
relativity (Abbott et al., 2016f). The ﬁrst three-detector
observation, GW170814, allowed for an examination of
the polarization of gravitational waves and to test their
consistency with general relativity (Abbott et al., 2017e).
Subsequently in their ﬁrst three observing periods, O1,
O2 and O3a (O3a is the ﬁrst 6 months of O3), LIGO and
Virgo observed a total of
50 gravitational wave signals
from compact binary coalescence (Abbott et al., 2019b,
2021d), and these observations have provided further op-
portunities to test general relativity (Abbott et al., 2019f,
2021i). Not all candidates were included in the analyses
testing general relativity; this is reserved for the best can-
didates. Hierarchical analyses in tests of general relativ-
ity were also employed in Carullo et al. (2021) and Ghosh
et al. (2021).

∼

For the tests of general relativity based on the LIGO-
Virgo O1 and O2 results, presented in Abbott et al.
(2019f), it was assumed that inconsistencies in general
relativity would occur in the same fashion for all events,
regardless of the properties of the source.
In the lat-
est LIGO-Virgo study of Abbott et al. (2021i), which in-
cludes O3a, this approach was loosened and a hierarchical
inference technique from Zimmerman et al. (2019) and Isi
et al. (2019a) was used for some tests. For every partic-
ular gravitational wave event that is tested, the param-
eters associated with a violation of general relativity are
selected from some universal distribution that has been
created from inference on all of the events. While this
distribution is initially not known, it could be resolved
with an appropriate description of gravity (beyond gen-
eral relativity) and the data from numerous events. One
can then do tests by comparing the derived distribution
with what one expects from general relativity.

The observation of gravitational waves from a binary
neutron star merger, GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017f),
provided further tests of general relativity, especially due
to the long period of time that the signal was observable
in the LIGO-Virgo operating frequency band and its large
SNR (Abbott et al., 2019e). The observation of a gamma
ray signal, 1.7 s after the binary neutron star merger,
allowed for unique tests of general relativity and Lorentz
invariance (Abbott et al., 2017d).

As with any parameter estimation routine, the model
for the signal is of critical importance. For the gravita-
tional waves produced by binary black holes the LIGO-
Virgo analyses have used the eﬀective-one-body SEOB-
NRv4 waveforms (Boh´e et al., 2017) (speciﬁcally, the

34

frequency domain SEOBNRv4 ROM) for non-precessing
spins for the black holes. To account for precessing spins
the phenomenological waveforms IMRPhenomPv2 (Han-
nam et al., 2014; Husa et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2016)
were used (Abbott et al., 2019f). For some of the events,
higher order modes were taken into account, and for these
the SEOBNRv4HM model (Babak et al., 2017; Ossokine
et al., 2020) and the IMRPhenomPv3HM model (Khan
et al., 2019, 2020) were employed. These waveforms for
binary black holes also address the inspiral, merger and
ringdown for the black holes. For gravitational waves
from binary neutron stars the eﬀects of the tidal de-
formations of the neutron stars must be taken into ac-
count. As such LIGO and Virgo have used the NRTidal
models (Dietrich et al., 2017, 2019) for the necessary ad-
ditional phase factor. The presence of eccentricity has
been ignored in the binary black hole and binary neu-
tron star models used by LIGO-Virgo to date (Abbott
et al., 2019e,f). As described in Sec. VI.A, uncertain-
ties in the calibration of the detector data are introduced
as part of the overall parameter estimation, and the in-
troduced parameters associated with detector response
function; in the end there is a marginalization over these
parameters (Abbott et al., 2016e).

A. Signal Residual Test

The parameter estimation methods used by LIGO and
Virgo are run on detected signals. This is typically done
using LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015). From this a
best ﬁt (in terms of maximum likelihood) waveform is
produced. After subtracting the best ﬁt waveform from
the observed gravitational wave data, a test is then per-
formed to see if the remaining residual is consistent with
Gaussian noise. This method has been applied to all 10
gravitational wave signals detected during O1 and O2
that were produced by binary black holes (Abbott et al.,
2019f); the method is further explained in (Abbott et al.,
2020c). The waveform model was IMRPhenomPv2 (Han-
nam et al., 2014; Husa et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2016).
This method was also applied for tests of general relativ-
ity for the events in the second LIGO-Virgo catalog (Ab-
bott et al., 2021d), and is further discussed in Ghonge
et al. (2020). For O3a the signal residual test was con-
ducted on a further 24 binary black hole produced grav-
itational wave signals (Abbott et al., 2021i).

For the 10 binary black hole produced gravitational
wave signals reported in (Abbott et al., 2019b), the best
ﬁt waveforms were produced and subtracted from a 1 s
stretch of the LIGO and Virgo data, with the merger time
in the middle. Since the model waveform was constructed
as to adhere to general relativity, by substracting the best
ﬁt model waveform one should be left with a residual
that resembles the noise of the detector. The residual is
tested to conﬁrm this assumption. LIGO and Virgo have

used the BayesWave (Cornish and Littenberg, 2015; Lit-
tenberg and Cornish, 2015) algorithm to conduct these
tests; see Sec. X.F for a description of BayesWave. With
the signal substracted, BayesWave analyzes the residual
data streams from the two or three detectors involved
in the detection. Three models are considered: the data
contain an elliptically polarized gravitational wave sig-
nal that is coherent in the diﬀerent data streams plus
Gaussian noise; there are uncorrelated noise transients
(glitches) present and Gaussian noise; there is only Gaus-
sian noise. BayesWave then calculates Bayes Factors for
model comparison. A p-value is computed to take into
account the variable background. A consequence of this
analysis is also a network SNR for the presence of a co-
herent gravitational wave signal in the diﬀerent resid-
ual data streams. Fig. 14 displays this process for the
gravitational waves detected from the binary black hole
merger GW170104 (Abbott et al., 2017b). Further exam-
ples from the LIGO-Virgo observations are summarized
in Sec. VI.

B. Inspiral - Merger - Ringdown Consistency for Binary
Black Holes

The estimated parameters from the inspiral part of
a binary black hole system can be compared with the
parameters estimated from the signal pertaining to the
merger and ringdown of the ﬁnal black hole, see Ghosh
et al. (2016) and Ghosh et al. (2018). The basic assump-
tion for this test is that the underlying theory that de-
scribes the inspiral, merger, and ringdown is general rela-
tivity. As such, one should be able to conduct parameter
estimation on these diﬀerent parts of the gravitational
wave signal and recover the same physical parameters
that describe the system. For the binary black hole sys-
tems the goal is to estimate the mass and spin of the
ﬁnal black hole remnant from the low frequency inspiral
part of the signal, and then again for the high frequency
merger-ringdown part of the signal (Abbott et al., 2019f).
An important goal will be to observe overtones in ad-
dition to the fundamental ringdown mode of the rem-
nant and test the no-hair theorem (Giesler et al., 2019).
The study of Isi et al. (2019b) analyzed LIGO data for
GW150914 and claimed that there was evidence at the
3.6σ level for the presence of the l = m = 2 quasinor-
mal mode and one overtone. The LIGO-Virgo analysis
of Abbott et al. (2021i) also searched for the presence
of overtones and found evidence for GW190521 (Bayes
factor of 19.5), and GW150914 (Bayes factor of 4.3).

A separation between the inspiral and merger-
ringdown regimes must be chosen for the analysis. The ﬁ-
nal black hole mass and spin are obtained from the initial
masses and spins using numerical relativity ﬁts (Healy
and Lousto, 2017; Healy et al., 2014; Hofmann et al.,
2016; Jim´enez-Forteza et al., 2017), and then the Kerr in-

Hanford, while the second panel does the same for LIGO-
Livingston. The time series for the data from the two de-
tectors is displayed in the third panel. The LIGO-Livingston
data had been inverted to account for a sign diﬀerence with
respect to LIGO-Hanford, and has been adjusted by 3 ms be-
cause of the diﬀerence in the arrival times. This time series
data has been ﬁltered with a 30-350 Hz bandpass. The black
line is the waveform corresponding to the maximum likelihood
from parameter estimation using the precessing spin model.
The maximum likelihood waveform is subtracted from the
gravitational wave data, and the residuals are then displayed
in the bottom panel. A statistical analysis of the residuals
shows that they are more consistent with Gaussian noise than
the presence of remaining coherent gravitational wave energy.
See (Abbott et al., 2017b) for more details.

nermost stable circular orbit frequency is computed from
the ﬁnal mass and spin using the expressions in Bardeen
et al. (1972). This frequency is used as the transition
from inspiral to merger-ringdown. With that, the rem-
nant’s ﬁnal spin and mass are estimated with the low
frequency inspiral part of the signal, and then again for

the high frequency merger-rigndown part of the signal.
The Bayesian parameter estimation is done with LAL-
Inference (Veitch et al., 2015), with the spin precess-
ing phenomenological IMRPhenomPv2 (Hannam et al.,
2014; Husa et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2016) and IMRPhe-
nomPv3HM (Khan et al., 2019, 2020) waveforms, plus
the eﬀective-one-body SEOBNRv4 waveform for binary
black holes with spins that are nonprecessing (Boh´e et al.,
2017). For the two frequency regions, the source param-
eters are estimated, and then comparisons are done with
simulations from numerical relativity (Healy and Lousto,
2017; Hofmann et al., 2016; Jim´enez-Forteza et al., 2017).
In this way the ﬁnal remnant’s mass Mf and dimension-
less spin χf = c
f ) are calculated from the data
before and after the innermost stable circular orbit, and
compared for consistency. This is done by calculating
the overlap of the posterior distributions for these pa-
rameters. The test also calculates the posteriors on the
ﬁnal mass and spin deviation parameters and quotes the
quantile of this distribution at which the general relativ-
ity predicted value of is recovered (Ghosh et al., 2018).
Finally, this analysis tests the emission of energy and
angular momentum predicted by general relativity, espe-
cially in the non-linear phase of the merger-ringdown.

This test was done for 7 of the 10 binary black hole
mergers observered during O1 and O2 that had suﬃcient
SNR for both parts of the signal. Using uniform priors
for the masses and the magnitude of the spins, plus priors
for the spin directions that are isotropic, the parameter
estimation and analysis for the ﬁnal black hole remnant
and spin magnitude were found to be consistent between
the inspiral part of the signal, and the merger-ringdown
part of the signal. This analysis was then repeated for 12
events in O3a, also using uniform priors for the deviation
parameters. No deviations from general relativity were
observed (Abbott et al., 2019f, 2021i). See Sec. VI.B.1
for an example with GW150914.

The inspiral-merger-ringdown test has also been
done including higher order modes with the IMRPhe-
nomPv3HM waveform (Khan et al., 2019, 2020) using
pBilby (Smith et al., 2020) for parameter estimation; see
Sec. X.C for more information on Bilby. This was done
for GW190412 and GW190814 (Abbott et al., 2020g,
2021i). Similarly, the inspiral-merger-ringdown analy-
sis has also been demonstrated using the NRSur7dq2
waveform (Blackman et al., 2017) and the RIFT pack-
age (Lange et al., 2018) for parameter estimation (Breschi
et al., 2019); see Sec.X.E for more information on RIFT.

1. Remnant Properties

LIGO-Virgo have also examined just the ringdown sig-
nal from binary black hole mergers (Abbott et al., 2021i).
The remnant after the merger will initially be a non-
spherical object, but by the no hair theorem, it must

36

come to equilibium as a Kerr black hole. The excited
remnant ringdown results in the emission of diﬀerent
damped sinusoidal signals, quasi-normal modes, that de-
pend only on the ﬁnal mass and spin of the Kerr black
hole, plus the integer indices of the modes. The infor-
mation from the observation of gravitational waves from
the ringdown would hence describe the ﬁnal state of the
remnant. A comparison can then be made to the energy
and angular momentum emitted through gravitational
waves during the inspiral. For the parameter estimation
of signals only containing the ringdown a time-domain
formulation of the likelihood is used. This method avoids
the contribution of spurious frequency contributions from
the pre-merger phase, or an abrupt windowing around
the peak of the signal which would give Gibbs phenom-
ena (Carullo et al., 2019; Isi et al., 2019b). Another ring-
down analysis is based on the EOB waveforms and con-
centrates on the gravitational wave signal and damping
time for a particular mode (220) (Brito et al., 2018). All
of the results from both analyses show consistency of the
ringdown parameter estimation with those derived from
the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal.

Another possible eﬀect associated with the remnant,
and outside of the theory of general relativity, con-
cerns the eﬀect of echoes on the generated gravitational
waves. This could pertain to exotic compact objects like
fuzzballs (Lunin and Mathur, 2002; Mathur, 2008) and
gravastars (Mazur and Mottola, 2001, 2004). With such
an object there may be a surface, between the light ring
and the location where the event horizon would be, that
would reﬂect gravitational waves. In such a case, when
two compact objects merge and emit gravitational waves,
some of the signals created would be reﬂected oﬀ this sur-
face, producing the so-called gravitational wave echoes.
In fact, a cavity like structure could be created, and a se-
ries of echo signals would be emitted, successively smaller
in amplitude. This eﬀect was claimed to have been ob-
served in the LIGO data for GW150914 by Abedi et al.
(2017). As presented in Abbott et al. (2021i), LIGO
and Virgo have implemented a signal template search for
echoes of ringdown signals from binary black hole merg-
ers. A Bayes factor is calculated between the presence
of inspiral-merger-ringdown-echo signals, and the general
relativity predicted inspiral-merger-ringdown signal. The
data from 31 binary black hole mergers were analyzed.
No evidence for the presence of echoes was found.

C. Parametrized Tests of Gravitational Waveforms

Since general relativity is a non-linear theory, simple
or closed form solutions are rare. Binary orbital systems,
losing energy through the emission of gravitational waves,
are described through post-Newtonian approximations,
namely expressing the orbit in terms of varying orders of
v/c (Blanchet, 2014; Blanchet et al., 2004, 2005, 1995).

For the standard gravitational wave parameter estima-
tion for a LIGO and Virgo detected signal the diﬀerent
post-Newtonian approximants are summed together to
form the model of the signal. However, if general rela-
tivity is not the correct theory to describe gravitational
phenomena, a discrepency might arise between the obser-
vation and the general relativistic model. Tests are done
on general relativity by allowing for a phase shift for the
diﬀerent post-Newtonian approximate terms. Parametric
deviations are also added to phenomenological parame-
ters in the merger-ringdown phases. In terms of param-
eter estimation, this is the introduction of an additional
phase parameter for each term in the post-Newtonian
expansion (Meidam et al., 2018).

This approach to test general relativity is divided
inspiral, inter-
amongst the three parts of the signal:
In the study of
mediate stage, and merger-ringdown.
the 10 binary black hole events from O1 and O2 re-
ported in (Abbott et al., 2019b), the IMRPhenomPv2
waveforms (Hannam et al., 2014; Husa et al., 2016; Khan
et al., 2016) are used, and the modiﬁcations to the vari-
ous phase terms are added to the expansion terms for this
model (Abbott et al., 2019f).
In addition, the SEOB-
NRv4 ROM waveform (Boh´e et al., 2017) was applied
to search for parametrized modiﬁcations in the inspiral.
For the inspiral part of the signal δφi represents the ad-
ditional phase for the ith Newtonian or post-Newtonian
term. The intermediate stage has two possible pertur-
bations to the phenomenological coeﬃcients, β2 and β3.
For the ﬁnal merger-ringdown part of the signal the
three phase perturbations to the phenomenological co-
eﬃcients are denoted by α2, α3 and α4. With the gen-
eral notation that pi represents the waveform coeﬃcients
φi, αi and βi, the parameter estimation code LALInfer-
ence (Veitch et al., 2015) is modiﬁed to make the adjust-
ment pi
(1 + δpi)pi. If the parameter estimation pro-
duced δpi is consistent with 0, then there is no evidence
for a violation of general relativity. The LIGO-Virgo
studies conduct these tests by varying one δpi param-
eter at a time, and calculate their posterior distribution
functions (Abbott et al., 2019f). A theory for gravity
that is diﬀerent than general relativity would probably
cause a deviation in all of the δpi parameters. This sim-
plifying choice is made because if all of the parameters
vary together, the correlations are so strong that at cur-
rent SNR, no meaningful constraints can be made; this
was displayed with GW150914 in Abbott et al. (2016f).
Fig. 15 uses the data from the ﬁve loudest gravitational
wave signals during O1 and O2 from binary black hole
mergers to set upper bounds on the magnitude of the
post-Newtonian parameters corresponding to the inspi-
ral part of the gravitational wave signal, δφi. This study
was repeated for 24 binary black produced gravitational
wave signals from O3a (Abbott et al., 2021i).

given based on the IMRPhenomPv2 waveform model. Then
a ﬁnal bound is calculated from the ﬁve events together by

sult is also presented for the SEOBNRv4 waveform. See (Ab-
bott et al., 2019f) for more details. Figure courtesy of LIGO
Laboratory (LIGO Laboratory, 2016).

D. Spin Induced Quadrupole Moment

A new test of general relativity by LIGO-Virgo for their
binary black hole merger events concerns the possible
inducement of a quadrupole moment due to the spin of
the black hole (Abbott et al., 2021i). The spin of a black
hole χ will create a quadrupole moment Q given by

Q =

κχ2m3 ,

−

(37)

∼

where m is the black hole mass and κ depends on the
object. With general relativity, a black hole will have
κ = 1. A neutron star could have κ in the range of
2
to 14 (Abbott et al., 2021i; Harry and Hinderer, 2018),
while for a boson star it could be several hundred (Chia
and Edwards, 2020). A spin induced quadrupole moment
will change the phase of the inspiraling compact binary.
The LIGO-Virgo study makes a simplifying assumption
that for a binary black hole, each object will have equal κ
parameters. The spin induced phase variation is included
in the waveforms, and parameter estimation is done in es-
timating the deviation of κ from 1 for the binary black
hole mergers observed in O1, O2 and O3a. The resulting

distribution for the deviation of κ is consistent with zero,
hence supporting the validity of general relativity (Ab-
bott et al., 2021i).

E. Polarization Tests

General relativity predicts only two tensor polariza-
tion modes for gravitational waves, while alternative the-
ories of gravity could could produce vector or scalar
modes (Chatziioannou et al., 2012); see also Will (2006),
Berti et al. (2015) and Callister et al. (2017) which give
many references for alternative theories of gravity that
can produce diﬀerent combinations of these polarizations.
The two LIGO detectors are relatively well-aligned with
respect to one another with only the curvature of the
Earth over the 3000 km displacement causing a slight
misalignment. As such, it is not possible for just the
two LIGO detectors to observe and test the polarization
of the detected gravitational waves. However the addi-
tion of a third detector to the network, Virgo, and es-
pecially because of its orientation with respect to the
LIGO detectors, provides for the means to probe the
polarization state of the observed gravitational waves.
When Advanced Virgo joined O2 it quickly participated
in three gravitational wave observations that could be
used to test the polarization content of the signals,
speciﬁcally the two binary black hole produced signals
GW170814 (Abbott et al., 2017e) and GW170818 (Ab-
bott et al., 2019b), and the binary neutron star produced
signal GW170817 (Abbott et al., 2017f).

For the ﬁrst three-detector observation of gravitational
waves, GW170814, a model comparison was done be-
tween the scenarios where the gravitational waves were
entirely of a tensor polarization, entirely of a vector po-
larization, or entirely of a scalar polarization. The re-
sponse of interferometric gravitational wave detectors
is diﬀerent for the tensor, vector and scalar polariza-
tions (Callister et al., 2017; Isi and Weinstein, 2017).
The LIGO-Virgo Bayesian parameter estimation soft-
ware, LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015), is used to an-
alyze the three-detector data. The particular interfer-
ometer responses for the diﬀerent polarizations change
the estimates for the sky location and luminosity dis-
tance for the source, however the estimates for the masses
and spins remain unchanged. For GW170814 LIGO and
Virgo calculated a Bayes factor exceeding 200 for a pure
tensor polarization model as compared to a pure vec-
tor tensor model; the Bayes factor exceeded 1000 for
the preferences of a pure tensor polarization model as
compared to the pure scalar polarization model (Abbott
et al., 2017e). A subsequent reanalysis of GW170814 us-
ing cleaned and recalibrated data reported a Bayes factor
of 30 for tensor compared to vector polarization, and 220
for tensor versus scalar (Abbott et al., 2019f). A similar
study of the binary black hole produced event GW170818

38

gave a Bayes factor of 12 for tensor polarization compared
to vector, and 407 for tensor compared to scalar (Abbott
et al., 2019f).

A further 17 events have been studied in this way in
O3a (Abbott et al., 2021i). The analysis done for O3a
is distinct from previous analyses as it uses a Bayesian
version of the null-stream test of polarizations suggested
in G¨ursel and Tinto (1989).

The binary neutron star merger event, GW170817,
produced even stronger evidence in support of general rel-
ativity and tensor gravitational wave polarization. The
pure tensor polarization model compared to the pure vec-
tor polarization model was favored with a log10 Bayes
factor of 20.81, while the pure tensor polarization model
compared to the pure scalar polarization model was pre-
ferred with a log10 Bayes factor of 23.09. These sub-
stantially larger Bayes factor results, as opposed to those
from the binary black hole observations, are due to a va-
riety of factors. The location on the sky of GW170817
could be determined extremely well from electromagnetic
observations. The network SNR of GW170817 was large,
and the position of the source in the sky was beneﬁcial
for a polarization test given the orientation of the de-
tectors (Abbott et al., 2019e; Takeda et al., 2021; Wong
et al., 2020).

LIGO and Virgo have searched for alternative polar-
izations in continuous gravitational wave signals (Abbott
et al., 2018c), and in the stochastic gravitational wave
background (Abbott et al., 2019d, 2021j). Note that with
these studies there is a search for every possible combi-
nation of the diﬀerent polarizations. See Secs. IX.A and
IX.B for more details.

F. Gravitational Wave Propagation

According to general relativity the speed at which
gravitational waves propagate should be equal to the
speed of light. This can now be tested. The mergers
of a binary neutron star systems were thought to be a
source of short gamma ray bursts. This was conﬁrmed
with the coincident observation of gravitational waves
from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817 (Abbott
et al., 2017f), and a gamma ray burst, GRB 170817A 1.7
s after the merger time (Abbott et al., 2017d).

The parameter estimation for the GW170817 signal
provided the time at which the two neutron stars coa-
lesced. In addition, the observations of a short gamma
ray burst were made by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (Fermi/GBM) (Goldstein et al., 2017) and the
Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the In-
ternational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (IN-
TEGRAL) (Savchenko et al., 2017). The recorded signals
from LIGO, Fermi/GBM and INTEGRAL are dispayed
in Fig. 16, and the 1.7 s delay is apparent.

tron stars. While it could very likely correspond to the
1.7 s observation, one can assume that the gravitational
waves and gamma rays were emitted simultaneously. In
this case, the speed of gravity would be faster than the
speed of light and the diﬀerence in the speeds would be
15. Another conserva-

tive assumption could be that the gamma emission hap-
pened 10 s after the merger (Ciolﬁ and Siegel, 2015; Rez-
16.
zolla and Kumar, 2015). In this case ∆v/c
As such, the GW170817 and GRB 170817A data from
LIGO, Virgo, Fermi/GBM and INTEGRAL were used
to constrain the diﬀerence between vg and c to be (Ab-

Another method to probe the validity of general rel-
ativity is to conduct parametrized tests of the propaga-
tion of gravitational waves. From GW170817 and GRB
170817A one knows that vg is extremely close to c. From
relativity a particle of mass m, momentum p, and energy
E will have this quantities related by

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 .

(39)

For a particle traveling at speed c, E = pc, and the rest
mass is m = 0. To test general relativity with the prop-
agation features of gravitational waves a dispersion rela-
tion can be assumed,

E2 = p2c2 + Aαpαcα .

(40)

A massive graviton would be reﬂected with α = 0 and
gc4, but other possible modiﬁcations to the dis-
A0 = m2
persion relation would be testable for α
= 0. LIGO and
Virgo have made such an assumption in their examina-
tion of the gravitational wave signals that they have ob-
served. The demonstrated small diﬀerence between c and
vg, and the very large distance from the source allows for
the gravitational wave amplitude (in the frequency do-
main) to be expressed simply

˜h(f ) = B(f )eiΦ(f ) ,

(41)

and the modifcation to the dispersion relation introduces
a slight change to the phase term, δΦ(f ). This phase
modiﬁcation is introduced into the parameter estima-
tion routines. Posterior probability distributions are then
generated for the Aα parameters; this is done for one par-
ticular value of α at a time for values between 0 and 4,
including non-integer values (Abbott et al., 2019f).

LIGO and Virgo have used the 10 gravitational wave
signals from binary black holes detected in O1 and O2
to constrain Aα for a number of α values. The limit
on the graviton mass is consequently constrained to
23 eV/c2 (Abbott et al., 2019f). A similar

of the luminosity distance to the source. With the gravi-
tational wave data the luminosity distance was estimated
to be 40+8
14 Mpc (Abbott et al., 2017f). However, the
−
follow-up multi-messenger observing campaign identiﬁed
the source of GW170817 and GRB 170817A to be in the
galaxy NGC 4993. Redshift measurements of the galaxy
and the use of the cosmological expansion Hubble con-
stant then provided a comparable estimation of the dis-
tance to the source to be 42.9+3.2
3.2 Mpc (Abbott et al.,
2017).

In principle, once one has a measurement of the arrival
time diﬀerence between the gravitational waves and the
gamma rays, plus an estimate of the distance, that will
allow for a calculation of the diﬀerence in the speeds. To
compare the speed of light, c, with the speed of grav-
ity, vg, one should use the most conservative estimate
for the distance, namely the lower limit, 26 Mpc. One
does not know, however, the time of the emission for the
gamma rays relative to the time of the merger of the neu-

binary neutron star merger GW170817 gives a limit on
22 eV/c2 (Abbott
the graviton mass of mg
et al., 2019e). The phase modiﬁcation increases δΦ(f )
with the distance to the source, and since the binary
black hole mergers are at a larger distance, they provide
a better limit on mg. A total of 31 events from O1, O2
and O3a have been analyzed in this fashion, producing a
23 eV/c2 with 90%
graviton mass limit of mg
credibility. For comparison, the limit set on the gravi-
ton mass from studies of the solar system ephemerides is

VIII. RATES AND POPULATIONS

Based on all observed gravitational wave signals, one
can use statistical methods to estimate the rates of binary
black hole or binary neutron star mergers, and describe
the population of these systems in the universe. With
50 announced gravitational wave detections to date it is
possible to use statistical methods to make statements
about how often compact binary mergers happen, and
what the probable formation scenarios for these binaries
might be. In Abbott et al. (2021f) LIGO and Virgo have
recently completed such studies from the O1, O2 and
O3a detections described in catalog GWTC-2 (Abbott
et al., 2021d); these studies are based on the 47 compact
binary mergers where the gravitational waves were de-
tected with a false-alarm-rate of less than one per year.
A similar rates and populations study was presented in
Abbott et al. (2019j) based on the 11 compact binary
produced gravitational events for O1 and O2 presented
in the catalog GWTC-1 (Abbott et al., 2019b). We sum-
marize here the latest methods used by LIGO and Virgo
to make statistical statements about the rate of compact
binary mergers and their possible formation scenarios.

A. Binary Black Holes

For the most recent LIGO-Virgo rates and popula-
tions study of binary black hole mergers presented in
Abbott et al. (2021f) it is demanded that both primary
objects have masses exceeding 3M
at 90% credibility,
and detected with a false-alarm-rate less than one per
year. This produces 44 events, although it excludes
GW190814 (Abbott et al., 2020i), with its masses of
m1 = 23.2+1.1
and m2 = 2.59+0.08
; the small sec-
ondary mass is considered to be an outlier and diﬃcult
to explain via binary formation; see Sec. VI.B.3.

These studies have a number of important goals. One
pertains to the mass and spin distributions of the black
holes in these merging binary systems. Part of the com-
plexity for this study concerns the possible mass limiting
eﬀects from (pulsational) pair-instability supernova pro-
cesses (Farmer et al., 2019; Spera and Mapelli, 2017).

135M

As discussed with the detection of GW190521 (Abbott
et al., 2020h,j), Sec. VI.B.4, it is diﬃcult to explain the
formation by stellar processes of black holes in the mass
64
. For component masses up to
range
one can imagine formation via common enve-
∼
lope evolution, which also produces nearly aligned spins;
see Kalogera (2000), Belczynski et al. (2002), Dominik
et al. (2015) and Eldridge et al. (2017). Black holes
could also form via dynamical processes in dense environ-
ments; they would not be aﬀected by (pulsational) pair-
instability supernova processes if they were formed by
previous mergers (Kulkarni et al., 1993; Portegies Zwart
and McMillan, 2002; Sigurdsson and Hernquist, 1993).
Such dynamical formation could create binary black holes
where the distribution of spins for the component masses
is isotroptic (Rodriguez et al., 2016). Primordial black
holes are another possible formation channel (Carr and
Hawking, 1974; Carr et al., 2016); in this case the black
holes would not have signiﬁcant spin, but what they do
have would be isotropic in direction (Fernandez and Pro-
fumo, 2019).

The observation of gravitational wave events by LIGO
and Virgo can also provide evidence as to the minimum
mass of black holes formed by astrophysical processes, as
opposed to primordial formation where any mass could,
in principle, be possible. As already noted, a component
mass for GW190814 is m2 = 2.59+0.08
; the question
is whether this is a black hole or a very heavy neutron
star. But even excluding GW190814, strong limits can
be placed on the minimum black hole mass. Important
research questions concern how gravitational wave obser-
vations can be used to distinguish between neutron star
and low-mass black hole mass distributions, and to ex-
plain the formation of these compact objects (Fishbach
et al., 2020).

0.09M

(cid:12)

−

Another important question pertaining to the masses
of observed binary black hole systems pertains to the
distribution of the mass ratio, namely q = m2/m1. The
observations by LIGO and Virgo seem to indicate that
roughly equal mass binary systems are preferred, but
there are important exceptions, as seen with GW190412
and GW190814; see Sec. VI.B.3.

The observed gravitational wave signals from binary
black holes also provide important information on the
spins of the initial component masses. Both the magni-
tudes of the spins and their orientation with respect to
the obital plane give evidence as to the possible formation
of the binary system.

Finally, it is not only important to estimate the rate
of binary black hole mergers, but also whether this rate
may change with redshift. For example, is there a sim-
ilarity between the black hole merger rate and the star
formation rate (Madau and Dickinson, 2014)?

LIGO and Virgo are aleady in a position to give in-
formative statements about all of these questions. Here
we present a review of how these statistical studies are

conducted, and summarize the latest results from the
GWTC-2 catalog from Abbott et al. (2021f).

1. Statistical Methods

The recent LIGO-Virgo results in Abbott et al. (2021f)
were based on the modeling approaches of Mandel et al.
(2019); Thrane and Talbot (2019); Vitale et al. (2020).
Bayesian hierarchical methods are used to estimate the
parameters of the binary black hole population given
Ndet individual events detected by LIGO and Virgo;
the data for these events are represented by di, i =
1, . . . , Ndet. This is accomplished by parameterizing the
prior distribution of individual black hole merger param-
eters such as their masses and spins, putting a hyperprior
distribution on these population parameters or hyperpa-
rameters. Then both individual parameters and hyper-
parameters are estimated and the posterior distribution
of the population parameters is extracted by marginal-
izing over the parameters of individual events. Now it
also needs to be taken into account that the number of
detected black hole merger events Ndet is a random vari-
able with a Poisson distribution with expectation given
by N ξ(Λ) where N denotes the total number of events
expected during the observation period and ξ(Λ) is the
fraction of detectable binaries for a population with hy-
perparameter Λ. This detection fraction is estimated
using injections as described in Abbott et al. (2021f).

|
hood for events i = 1, . . . , Ndet. The θi are assumed to
be conditionally independent with joint population dis-
tribution depending on a hyperparameter vector Λ. This
model can be represented in a hierarchy of priors, where
the ﬁrst level of the hierarchical prior is comprised of the
prior distributions of individual parameters θi and Ndet
and the second level consists of the hyperprior distribu-
tion of the prior parameters Λ and N :

2. Binary Black Hole Models

LIGO and Virgo have used models of various complex-
ities to attempt to describe the mass distribution of the
black holes in merging systems. We give a brief summary
of the models used in Abbott et al. (2021f).

The simplest is the Truncated model, where there are
two hard cut-oﬀs between a minimum mass and a maxi-
mum mass, with a power law form for the primary (most
massive) mass, and the mass ratio. The high mass cut-
oﬀ is assumed to correspond to where the pair instability
mass gap begins (Farmer et al., 2019; Spera and Mapelli,
2017). Note that the Truncated model need not ﬁnish
where the pair-instability gap is.
If there are merger
products forming new binaries, the maximum mass would
be higher. To ﬁnd the mass gap in the presence of these
mergers would require a model allowing for second gen-
eration black holes, such as in the study of Kimball et al.
(2020). This model depends on 4 parameters.

The Broken Power Law model makes slight modiﬁca-
tions to the Truncated model. The hard lower mass cut-
oﬀ is replaced with a smoothing function. There is also
a break, at some mass, in the power law between the

and marginalizing over all θi and N (with π(N )

two cut-oﬀs, thereby changing the slope of the mass dis-
tribution. In this way, the formation of black holes by
means not prevented by pair-instability supernovae can
be avoided. This model has 7 parameters.

The Power Law + Peak model is also a slight modiﬁ-
cation to the Truncated model. Again the hard cut-oﬀ at
the low mass limit is replaced by a smoothing function.
For large masses there is the addition of a Gaussian peak.
This peak would try to address an excess of events that
are limited from being more massive by pulsational pair
instability supernovae (Talbot and Thrane, 2018). This
model has 8 parameters.

Finally, the Multi Peak model is an extension of the
Power Law + Peak model. However, for the Multi Peak
model two peaks are assumed. The assumption is that
with this model hierarchical binary black hole mergers
can be addressed, namely the possible population of sec-
ond generation black holes. This model has 11 parame-
ters. See Fig. 17 for a graphical representation of these
mass distribution models that have been used in Abbott
et al. (2021f).

The next important question addressed by LIGO-
Virgo is to whether the binary black hole merger rate
depends on redshift (Fishbach et al., 2018). The simplest
model assumes that there is no dependence on redshift;
this is what is referred to as the Non-Evolving model,
which has no parameters. A redshift dependance is ad-
dressed in the Power-Law Evolution model, where the
binary black hole merger rate density is assumed to vary
as a power-law with (1 + z). This model has one param-
eter.

Finally, the binary black hole mergers should describe
the distribution of spins for the initial component masses.
These distributions must describe the magnitude and di-
rection of the spins. For the spin direction the reference is
typically the orbital angular momentum vector, and one
tries to describe the distribution of the tilts with respect
to this. The models for the spin distributions try to en-
compass diﬀerent binary black hole formation scenarios.
The simplest model, called the Default, assumes the same
spin distribution for each initial black hole component.
A beta distribution, depending on mean and variance pa-
rameters, describes the spin magntitude (Wysocki et al.,
2019b). The distribution for the tilt tries to describe two
formation channels. For black hole binaries formed by
dynamical processes the component for the tilt distribu-
tion of the progenitor black holes is isotropic. However
for binaries formed in the isolated ﬁeld of stellar pro-
genitors the spins are more likely to be aligned with the
orbital angular momentum, and hence a Gaussian distri-
bution (depending on some variance) is assumed about
the tilt of zero. A mixing parameter describes the relative
number of binary black holes systems formed between
these ﬁeld and dynamic scenarios. This spin distribution
has been introduced in Talbot and Thrane (2017). The
Default model depends on 4 parameters.

42

The Gaussian spin model works by describing spins in
terms of the eﬀective spin parameter χeﬀ and the eﬀec-
tive precession spin parameter χp. A bivariate Gaussian
distribution is used to describe the mean and standard
deviation for χeﬀ and χp, plus the correlation between
them. Hence this model has 5 paramters.

The Multi Spin model simultaneously addresses both
mass and spin distributions. The goal is to see if there is
a variation in the binary black hole spin distribution as a
function of mass. There is a hard cut-oﬀ for the masses,
like the Truncated model, but there are also Gaussian
components for the two initial masses, in addition to the
power law. This is somewhat similar to the Power Law
+ Peak model. Each possible mass distribution can have
its own independent spin distribution from the Default
model. The Multi Spin model depends on 12 spin pa-
rameters and 10 mass parameters.

Comprehensive descriptions of all of these models can

be found in Abbott et al. (2021f).

3. Binary Black Hole Population Results from GWTC-2

The LIGO-Virgo detections presented in Abbott et al.
(2021d) have led to a number of important conclusions
that are reported in Abbott et al. (2021f). Gravitational
wave observations are describing the rates of compact
binary coalescences, and we can expect that future de-
tections will continue to improve our knowledge about
black holes and neutron stars in the universe.

instability supernova processes. The power-law distribu-
tion for the higher masses reaches up to a maximum of

holes from the data from binary mergers is highly de-
pendent on whether GW190814 (Abbott et al., 2020i) is
included in the study or not. If ignored, the studies give
a preference for a lower black hole mass around 7M

The binary black hole merger rate as a function of
redshift does not appear to be uniform. The analysis
reveals a preference for models where the binary black
hole merger rate increases with redshift, but not as fast
as the increase in star formation rate with redshift (Fish-
bach and Kalogera, 2021). Speciﬁcally, the Power-Law

Evolution model was used to describe the redshift, while
two mass models were used, namely Power Law + Peak
and Broken Power Law. The merger rate is assumed to
depend on redshift, z, as (1 + z)κ.

model the redshift dependence for the merger rate goes

with the star formation rate estimate of κ = 2.7 from
Madau and Dickinson (2014). Also, the probability that
the binary black hole merger rate dependence κ > 0 is
about 90% for both mass distribution models.

diﬀerent spin models. Systems with a non-zero χp will
experience orbital precession. Consequently, this eﬀect
should not be expected to be rare in stellar mass binary
black hole systems.

Distributions are also generated for the eﬀective spin
parameter χeﬀ , measuring the component spins aligned
with the orbital angular momentum. The mean of the
χeﬀ distribution is µeﬀ = 0.06+0.05
0.05, but with a standard
deviation of σeﬀ = 0.12+0.06
0.04, implying that many sys-
tems have χeﬀ < 0, or at least one component mass with
its spin being misaligned by more than 90◦ from the or-
bital angular momentum. The estimate is that 12% to
44% of the binary black hole systems have a mass com-
ponent with a spin misaligned by more than 90◦ from the
orbital angular momentum. This suggests that these bi-
naries would be formed from dynamic processes, whereas
aligned spin systems could be from the ﬁeld formation of
isolated stellar progenitors. Note that analysis of Roulet
et al. (2020) ﬁnds less support for negative χeﬀ , possibly
due to tidally torqued stellar progenitors.

Finally, the observed spin distributions do not seem
to depend on the masses of the progenitors. A black
hole formed by the merger of two roughly equal mass

≈

progenitors would have an eﬀective spin of approximately
χ
0.7. This would lead to the assumption that heavier
black holes would have more spin. The preference for
higher spin for the heavier black holes is not statistically
signiﬁcant.

The distributions for the mass, redshift and spins for
binary black holes will become better understood with
future observations. The full presentation of the popula-
tion properties of binary black holes is given in Abbott
et al. (2021d).

B. Binary Neutron Stars

LIGO and Virgo have observed gravitational wave from
two neutron star mergers, GW170817 (Abbott et al.,
2017f) and GW190425 (Abbott et al., 2020a) as reported
in GWTC-2 (Abbott et al., 2021d). With the assumption
that the initial neutron stars are non-spinning, and that
there is a uniform distribution for their masses between

IX. OTHER SIGNAL SEARCHES FOR LIGO AND VIRGO

There are many other sources of gravitational waves
targeted by LIGO and Virgo. Here we summarize the
signal searches and associated parameter estimation for
short and long duration transients (bursts), continuous
waves (from pulsars), and a stochastic gravitational wave
background. These types of signals have yet to be ob-
served, but sophisticated methods are in place for at-
tempts at detection and then associated parameter esti-
mation. In the absence of a detection, limits on various
parameters have been set.

A. Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background

The superposition of many independent gravitational
wave sources will produce a stochastic gravitational wave
background (Christensen, 2019). Just as there is a cos-
mic microwave background, it is likely that gravitational
waves were created in the early universe, creating a
stochastic background that could be observable today.
These cosmological sources would be quantum ﬂuctua-
tions in space-time during inﬂation, phase transitions, or
cosmic strings. Astrophysical processes over the history
of the universe could also create a stochastic background.
These sources would include binary black hole and bi-
nary neutron star mergers, supernovae, pulsars, magne-
tars, or other processes. The observation of gravitational
wave events from binary black hole and binary neutron
star mergers (Abbott et al., 2019b) implies that there
is a stochastic background that may be measureable by
LIGO-Virgo in the coming years (Abbott et al., 2019d).
Another assumption is that the stochastic gravita-
tional wave background is isotropic, namely that the
characteristics of the gravitational waves are independent
of their direction. As such, the LIGO-Virgo correlation
analysis tries to determine the energy density of gravi-
tational waves in the universe. The normalized energy
density of the stochastic background is expressed as

ΩGW(f ) =

f
ρc

dρGW
df

,

(44)

where ρGW is the energy density of gravitational waves,
0 c2/(8πG),
the closure density of the universe is ρc = 3H 2
c is the speed of light, G is Newton’s constant, and we

ΩGW(f ) = Ωα

(45)

The reference frequency fref provides location for which
the limit on Ωα is set.

44

The level of the stochastic gravitational wave signal
will be far below the detector noise in the LIGO and
Virgo interferometers. The assumption, however, is that
there is a common signal present in the diﬀerent detec-
tors, whereas the noise is independent between the de-
tectors. A correlation analysis using the data from pairs
of detectors will allow for the extraction of the common
signal (Christensen, 1992; Romano and Cornish, 2017).
Consider ﬁrst a simple model where the signal in detector
k

s(k)(t) = h(t) + n(k)(t),

k = 1, 2

(46)

is the sum of a gravitational wave signal, which is the
same in all detectors, and noise n(k)(t), which is unique
n(k). A simple
to each detector. It is assumed that h
correlation between the data from two detectors would
then give (Christensen, 1992)

(cid:28)

Cov(s(1)(t), s(2)(t)) = Cov(h(t) + n(1)(t), h(t) + n(2)(t))
= Cov(h(t), h(t)).

(47)

This again assumes that the noise in the two detectors is
independent and not correlated (exceptions are explained
below). In reality, the detectors are located at diﬀerent
locations on the Earth. Hence there is a reduction of the
correlation due to the non-alignment of the detectors, and
their physical separation. This eﬀect is encompassed in
what is known as the overlap reduction function

where the detector response functions for two detectors,
see Eq. 22 and Eq. 23, depend not only on the direc-
tion of the gravitational wave source, (φ, θ) in an Earth
centered coordinated system, but also on their positions
on the Earth and relative orientations. For an isotropic
stochastic gravitational wave background the waves of
frequency f come from all directions, namely

(49)

and x is the vector from the vertex of detector 1 to the
vertex of detector 2.

The LIGO-Virgo stochastic background search pro-

duces a cross-correlation statistic, ˆC IJ (fa), deﬁned as

ˆC IJ (fa) =

2
T

Re[˜s∗I (fa)˜sJ (fa)]
γIJ (fa)S0(fa)

(50)

where I and J refer to particular detectors in the net-
work, fa is the frequency in bin a, T is the length of time
used to calculate the Fourier transform, γIJ (fa) is the
normalized overlap reduction function between detectors

I and J (Christensen, 1992), ˜sI (fa) is the Fourier trans-
form of the strain time series in detector I (see Eq. 30),
and the spectral shape for a ﬂat background is given by

S0(fa) =

3H 2

10π2f 3
a

(51)

(Abbott et al., 2019d). The expected value of the cross-
correlation statistic is such that in each frequency bin
(cid:10) ˆC IJ (fa)(cid:11) = ΩGW(fa) .

(52)

The variance of the cross-correlation statistic, assuming
that the gravitational wave signal is much smaller than
the detector noise, is given by

σ2
IJ (fa) =

(53)

where ∆fa is the frequency resolution between the bins fa
and fa+1, PI (fa) is the one-sided noise PSD for detector
I.

The next step is to create an optimal estimator of the
energy density of the stochastic background, namely (Ab-
bott et al., 2019d)

One can deﬁne a log-likelihood function that compares

where the parameters for the model are represented by

the LIGO-Virgo frequency band is predicted to be ap-
proximately ﬂat, α = 0, while a background created
by binary black hole and binary neutron star merg-
ers throughout the history of the universe would have
α = 2/3 in the LIGO-Virgo observational band. Prior
probabilities are then deﬁned and the parameters can
be estimated. While this statistical approach used by
LIGO and Virgo is a combinations of frequentist and
Bayesian methods, it has been shown that the gener-
ated results are the same as what can be derived from a
fully Bayesian analysis (Matas and Romano, 2021). This
LIGO and Virgo parameter estimation method for the
stochastic background search is based on the presenta-
tion of Mandic et al. (2012); this approach was recently
expanded to use nested sampling to create the posterior
distributions (Callister et al., 2017).

No stochastic gravitational wave background has been
detected by LIGO-Virgo, so upper limits have been set
that depend on α and are based on the data from ob-
serving runs O1, O2 and O3. This includes marginal-
ization over the calibration uncertainties. The data in
the 20 Hz to 1726 Hz band was used. For α = 0 a
95% credible level upper limit was set at fref = 25 Hz
9, and for α = 2/3 the upper
to be Ω0 < 5.8
×
9 (Abbott
limit for fref = 25 Hz is Ω2/3 < 3.4
et al., 2019d, 2021j). Just as there are anisotropies in
the cosmic microwave background, there could be such
anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave back-
ground. LIGO and Virgo also search for an anisotropic
gravitational wave background. No such background has
been observed (Abbott et al., 2019k, 2021g). It is likely
that an astrophysically produced stochastic background
would be anisotropic (Jenkins and Sakellariadou, 2018).
General relativity predicts two polarizations for grav-
itational waves. This is similar to electromagnetic radi-
ation. Gravitational waves have a quadrupole form, and
one says that they have a tensor polarization. Alternate
theories of gravity predict scalar and vector polarizations
as well. A Bayesian parameter estimation method us-
ing nested sampling, including model comparison, has
been developed in order to search for a stochastic grav-
itational wave background containing scalar, vector po-
larizations (Callister et al., 2017). This has been ap-
plied to the Advanced LIGO O1 (Abbott et al., 2018d)
and O2 (Abbott et al., 2019d) data. A Bayesian odds
was computed for having a stochastic background of any
polarization present in the data versus Gaussian noise.
Another computed Bayesian odds compared models hav-
ing vector and scalar polarizations in comparison to the
general relativisitic prediction of just having the tensor
polarizations. No background was detected for any po-
larization and upper limits have been set on their energy
densities. Using the O3 LIGO-Virgo data and doing a
marginalization over the polarization spectral index α

the upper limit on a scalar polarization stochastic grav-
itational wave background is Ω(S)

tion the limit is Ω(V )

The search for a stochastic gravitational wave back-
ground depends on correlations between two or more
detectors since the signal level is far below the noise
in an individual detector. An assumption in the anal-
ysis is that the noise in the diﬀerent detectors is in-
dependent, and not correlated. Two co-located detec-
tors would have the best relative orientation for detec-
tion sensitivity. But being co-located would likely lead
to correlated noise. This was the case for the initial
LIGO S5 stochastic search involving the two co-located
H1 (4 km) and H2 (2 km) interferometers (Aasi et al.,
2015b). It was impossible to eliminate correlated noise
below 460 Hz. Consequently the upper limit on the en-
ergy density of the stochastic gravitational wave back-
4(f /900Hz)3.
ground was set at ΩGW(f ) < 7.7
With the LIGO and Virgo (and KAGRA) sites separated
by thousands of kilometers one might naively expect that
there would be no correlated noise. However this is not
the case. The Schumann resonances are formed by elec-
tromagnetic standing waves in the spherical cavity be-
tween the surface of the Earth and the ionosphere (Schu-
mann, 1952; Schumann and K¨onig, 1954). The cavity
is excited by lightning strikes around the world (Price
and Melnikov, 2004). Magnetometers at the LIGO and
Virgo sites have conﬁrmed the presence of correlated
magnetic ﬁelds (Thrane et al., 2013); correlations have
also been observed when including the KAGRA site in
the network (Coughlin et al., 2018). Coincident mag-
netic bursts, short duration transients (10s to 100s of
milli-seconds in duration), have also been observed in the
network (Kowalska-Leszczynska et al., 2017). Diﬀerent
mitigation schemes have been proposed (Coughlin et al.,
2016; Thrane et al., 2014). The LIGO-Virgo searches
for an isotropic stochastic background now ensure that
correlated magnetic noise is not corrupting the search.

A Bayesian parameter estimation approach for ad-
dressing correlated magnetic noise in the LIGO-Virgo
stochastic background searches has been introduced
in (Meyers et al., 2020). The models used for the pa-
rameter estimation consider the sprectral shape and am-
plitude of a stochastic background, namely Eq. 45, and
also the magnetic noise contamination from the struc-
ture of the Schumann resonances and the magnetic noise
transfer functions in LIGO and Virgo. An artiﬁcial sig-
nal injection study showed that it was possible to esti-
mate the parameters describing a stochastic gravitational
wave background and the magnetic ﬁeld transfer function
in the three LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave interferom-
eters. This method has been used to address possible
coherent magnetic ﬁeld coupling in the LIGO-Virgo O3

46

stochastic background search; the Bayes factor for the
presence of magnetic contamination was suﬃciently low,
showing that this possible correlated noise did not aﬀect
the study (Abbott et al., 2021j).

The method used in Meyers et al. (2020) to use pa-
rameter estimation to distinguish a stochastic gravita-
tional wave background from magnetic contamination
can also be used to distinguish diﬀerent stochastic back-
grounds with diﬀerent slopes, or a stochastic background
described by a broken power law, as could be produced
by phase transitions in the early universe. This method
is described in Martinovic et al. (2021). The study shows
that spectral separation for multiple backgrounds could
be diﬃcult for the Advanced LIGO - Advanced Virgo
network, but could be possible with third generation de-
tectors such as the Einstein Telescope (Punturo et al.,
2010) or Cosmic Explorer (Abbott et al., 2017c; Re-
itze et al., 2019). The third generation detectors will
be able to observe almost all binary black hole merg-
ers in the observable universe, plus many binary neutron
star mergers (Regimbau et al., 2017); these events can
then be subtracted from the data and allow for observ-
ing a cosmologically produced stochastic background at
12 at 15 Hz (Sachdev et al.,
the level of ΩGW
2020). However using parameter estimation techniques
for spectral separation the sensitivity limit can be re-
13 for cosmic strings and
duced to ΩGW
10−
13 for broken power law models from
ΩGW
phase transitions at 25 Hz (Martinovic et al., 2021).

The ability to use parameter estimation for spectral
separation of the stochastic gravitational wave back-
ground has been addressed in many studies. We sum-
marize those here that are applicable to LIGO-Virgo, or
third generation ground based detectors. A frequentist
method to conduct component separation method was
presented in (Parida et al., 2016); this uses Fisher In-
formation matrices and maximum likelihood estimation,
and is proposed to replace MCMC methods. Filters for
broken power laws have been proposed to distinguish
various stochastic backgrounds (Ungarelli and Vecchio,
2004). Yet another approach (Biscoveanu et al., 2020b)
attempts to directly observe the stochastic background
produced by binary black hole mergers over the history
of the universe. In order to do this one must cut the data
into time segments and assign a probability for the pres-
ence of a binary black hole produced gravitational wave
signal. Bayesian parameter estimation methods are used
to generate the probability for the presence of such a
signal, especially concentrating on low amplitude signals
that would not be directly detected by standard signal
search methods (Smith and Thrane, 2018).

B. Continuous Wave Signals

series

A rotating neutron star that is highly magnetized will
often emit regular pulses of electromagnetic radiation.
These are known as pulsars. Such a rotating neutron
star with some sort of non-axisymmetric shape will emit
gravitational waves (Jones and Andersson, 2002; Zim-
mermann and Szedenits, 1979). These signals would
be quasi-periodic, long duration, having amplitudes and
frequencies that are essentially constant. The gravita-
tional wave signal would be sinusoidal at signal frequency
fs related to the neutron star rotation frequency fr by
fs = 2fr. There are other mechanisms that could pro-
duce gravitational waves at other frequencies, harmon-
ics and the rotation frequency itself (Glampedakis and
Gualtieri, 2018; Jones, 2010). For this review we will
concentrate on signals obeying the relationship fs = 2fr.

There are diﬀerent strategies for searching for a con-
tinuous gravitational wave signal from a rotating neutron
star. A targeted search attempts to ﬁnd a signal from a
known pulsar. In this case the location of the source on
the sky is known, as well as the rotational information
(such as the rotational frequency and the phase) from
electromagnetic observations. A directed search concen-
trates on interesting locations on the sky, such as a su-
pernova remnant; such a location may contain a rotating
neutron star, but there is no information about the pa-
rameters associated with the rotation. An all-sky search
attempts to ﬁnd continuous gravitation wave signals at
every location on the sky, and then over a large range
of parameters pertaining to rotation. LIGO and Virgo
have conducted numerous searches for continuous wave
signals, although no detection has been made. So far in
the ﬁrst three observational runs of the advanced detec-
tor era these include Abbott et al. (2017d, 2019g,l,m,n,
2020f).

The observed gravitational wave signal from a rotating

neutron star would have the form,

h(t) = F+(t, ψ)h0

where the magnitude of the gravitational wave is h0, ψ
is the polarization angle, ι the angle between the line of
sight and the pulsar’s spin axis, and φ(t) describes the
phase evolution. F+(t, ψ) and F
(t, ψ) represent the re-
sponse of an interferometric detector to the gravitational
wave of the two polarizations, and the polarization angle
is ψ; these response functions also account for the sky po-
sition and the orientation of the detector (Abbott et al.,
2004; Jaranowski et al., 1998). The detected signal will
have a phase evolution that can be expressed as a Taylor

and relativistic corrections to the arrival time are within
∆T (Abbott et al., 2004; Christensen et al., 2004b; Tay-
lor, 1994). The time derivative ˙fs is very small for the
majority of pulsars, and timing noise is typically much
larger than ¨fs. When radio observations give informa-
tion on fs and ˙fs, heterodyning by multiplying the data
iφ(t)], followed by low-pass ﬁltering and resam-
by exp[
pling will then produce a model with four unknown pa-
rameters: h0, ψ, ι, and φ0. The uncertainties of the fre-
quency and frequency derivative give two other parame-
ters (Christensen et al., 2004b; Dupuis and Woan, 2005;
Umst¨atter et al., 2004).

−

MCMC methods were ﬁrst applied to such gravita-
tional wave signals using simulated data in Christensen
et al. (2004b). A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Gilks
et al., 1996) was ﬁrst applied to a signal described by
the four parameters h0, ψ, ι, and φ0.
In such a case
the sky position and signal frequency are assumed to be
known from electromagnetic observations. The MCMC
method was successfully demonstrated. A ﬁfth param-
eter was then added, the uncertainty in the frequency
of the source, ∆f . This would be a situation where a
potential source has known location, but with unknown
rotation frequency. A presumed rotating neutron star
at the locations of SN1987A (Cigan et al., 2019; Zhang
et al., 2018) or Scorpius X-1 (Shklovsky, 1967) would be
examples of this application. A subsequent study then
expanded the number of parameters to six by also in-
cluding the uncertainty of the frequency derivative of
the rotating neutron star, ∆ ˙f (Umst¨atter et al., 2004).
The study presented methods to sample a posterior dis-
tribution with delayed rejection, reparametrizaton, and
simulated annealing. This is an improved method for
searching for a signal at a known sky location, but lack-
ing information on the neutron star rotation parame-
ters. While one MCMC routine would run per com-
puting core, an extension of the technique would be to
have many MCMCs running on diﬀerent computer pro-
cessors, changing the rotation parameters prior probabili-
ties and giving a search over a larger range of frequencies.
The Bayesian methods were further extended in Dupuis
and Woan (2005) where they developed a more complete
structure for a signal search and parameter estimation
with gravitational wave data, and applied to known ra-

dio pulsars. They also applied the method for data from
multiple detectors, looking for a coherent signal.

A new version of parameter estimation for continu-
ous wave signals from known pulsars was developed and
presented in Pitkin et al. (2012); this used nested sam-
pling (Skilling, 2006). The possibilities for model se-
lection were also discussed. This method was realized
with LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015). Further devel-
opments were presented in Pitkin et al. (2017).

The Advanced LIGO - Advanced Virgo signal searches
have used these Bayesian methods, along with subse-
quent technical developments. For the search of the
LIGO O1 data, the Bayesian nested sampling method
was applied in the search for gravitational waves from
200 known pulsars (Abbott et al., 2017d).

The original raw L1 and H1 data has a sampling rate
of 16,384 Hz, but was then heterodyned according to
the phase evolution known from electromagnetic obser-
vations. Low frequency noise was removed with a low
pass ﬁlter, and then downsampled to one data point per
minute. The bandwidth of the search was then 1/60 Hz.
The uncertainty in the phase evolution for a pulsar were
addressed with the applied nested sampling routine.

Using the data from two detectors also provided the
ability to calculate various Bayes factors for the compar-
ison of diﬀerent models such as the presence of a coherent
signal in both detectors, incoherent and diﬀerent signals
in the two detectors, or just independent Gaussian noise
in each detector.
OS/N represents the ratio of the prob-
ability that two detectors have a coherent continuous-
wave signal to the probability that both detectors just
OS/I represents the
contain independent Gaussian noise.
ratio of the probability that two detectors have a coher-
ent continuous-wave signal to the probability that each
detector has independent signals or noise with respect
to the other detector. For the 200 pulsars in the study
of Abbott et al. (2017d) the distribution of
OS/N and
OS/I values are displayed in Fig. 18. The pulsar PSR
J1932+17 had a value of
8, however it was not

cially considering Jeﬀreys scaling (Jeﬀreys, 1961). The

from interference in the data. No other signals had signif-
icant probabilities for containing a continuous wave sig-
nal. As such, no gravitational wave signal was claimed
to be observed from these 200 pulsars (Abbott et al.,
2017d).

This nested sampling method was then extended to
a search for not just a signal at twice the rotation fre-
quency (from the from both the l = m = 2 mass
quadrupole mode), but also the rotation frequency (from
the l = 2, m = 1 mode) itself. A narrowband time series
is made for both frequencies, and this Bayesian analysis
then searches for both signals together coherently; the
pulsar inclination angle parameter and the polarization

angle are assumed to be the same for both frequencies.
If a pulsar had a rotation glitch, as observed from elec-
tromagnetic observations, within the time period of the
gravitational wave observations, then an additional pa-
rameter is added to the analysis, namely an unknown
phase oﬀset after the glitch. Data was used from Ad-
vanced LIGO observing runs O1 and O2, and the search
targeting 222 known pulsars with rotation frequencies of
10 Hz or larger. No gravitational wave signal was found
at either frequency for any of the pulsars, and various lim-
its were placed for physical parameters associated with
the pulsars (Abbott et al., 2019n).

Using LIGO-Virgo data from O3, combined with the
data from O1 and O2, this same Bayesian search has
been conducted for gravitational wave signals from ﬁve
pulsars. While again no signals were observed, impor-
tant limits have been placed on the pulsars’ equitorial
8 (Abbott
ellipticities, limiting them to be less that 10−
et al., 2020f). A search has also been done with O3 data
for continuous gravitational waves from young supernova
remnants (Abbott et al., 2021h), as well as an all sky
search for isolated neutron stars (Abbott et al., 2021b);
again no signals have been detected.

A method to search for non-tensorial polarizations in
continuous gravitational wave signals has been devel-
oped. For alternative theories of gravity, this typically
involves the addition of vector and scalar polarization
modes. First, there exists a means to detect gravitational

wave signals of any mixture of polarizations, and measure
the polarization content (Isi et al., 2015). Using nested
sampling one can then implement model selection (Pitkin
et al., 2017); this can be a comparison for the presence of
a gravitational wave signal versus just noise, or if a sig-
nal is present, the polarization content (Isi et al., 2017).
The method was used to analyze the Advanced LIGO
O1 data for possible continuous gravitational wave sig-
nals from 200 known pulsars. The search targeted pos-
sible tensor, vector and scalar polarizations. No signals
of any of the polarizations were detected, so upper limits
were placed for the amplitudes of signals for the diﬀerent
polarizations (Abbott et al., 2018c).

Convolutional neural networks were presented in Dreis-
sigacker et al. (2019) as a means to conduct a search for
continuous gravitational waves. The method appears to
be promising in terms of the speed of the analysis. How-
ever, more work is needed in order to improve the prob-
ability of detection.

Using an MCMC to optimize the F-Statistic, a tech-
nique has been developed for a hierarchical follow-up
of potential continuous gravitational wave events pro-
duced in semi-coherent searches over a large parame-
ter space (Ashton and Prix, 2018). This method uses
an aﬃne-invariant ensemble sampler (Foreman-Mackey
et al., 2013).

C. Core-Collapse Supernovae

One of the most important possible signal source for
LIGO and Virgo would be from a core-collapse super-
novae (CCSN) (Abdikamalov et al., 2020; Gossan et al.,
2016; Radice et al., 2019). Gravitational wave observa-
tions from CCSN can aide in our ability to discern the
explosion mechanisms of stars. The extremely compli-
cated nature of CCSN creates a challenge for estimating
the physical parameters. The last few years have seen
much progress in the development of numerical codes for
simulating the physics of CCSN, including gravitational
wave emission (M¨uller, 2020).

LIGO and Virgo have not yet observed gravitational
waves from CCSN (Abbott et al., 2020e). CCSN oﬀer an
unique opportunity to conduct multimessenger astron-
omy, with the chance to observe gravitational waves, elec-
tromagnetic radiation, and neutrinos from the CCSN. In
fact, the importance of multimessenger astronomy was
displayed with the electromagnetic and neutrino obser-
vations of SN1987A (Bionta et al., 1987; Hirata et al.,
1987). The timescale for a CCSN produced gravitational
wave signal is short, about 1 s or less. CCSN are an
important target for LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave
observations (Abbott et al., 2019i, 2020e).

The emission of electromagnetic radiation from a
CCSN can be delayed, from seconds to days, due to the
high densities of charged particles present. The photons

49

are forced to do a random walk through the material in
order to exit (Rabinak and Waxman, 2011; Waxman and
Katz, 2017). On the other hand, gravitational waves and
neutrinos can exit instantly from the core of the star, and
they will carry important information about the physi-
cal processes, such as the core collapse and the revival
of the shock-wave (Kuroda et al., 2017). It is impossible
to derive analytical expressions for gravitational waves
from CCSN that capture the complexity involved with
all the physical processes: high energy particle physics,
nuclear physics, general relativity, thermodynamics. The
predicted gravitational wave signals are a product of the
numerical simulations, but these can take months to run
for a single waveform capturing all of the complicated
physics in the three dimensions (Bruenn et al., 2020).
Parameter estimation methods will need to work with
these conditions, so imaginative methods are required.

The work of Summerscales et al. (2008) used a
maximum-a-posteriori approach to attempt to separate
the gravitational wave signal produced by a CCSN from
the detector noise. They justify the Gaussian assump-
tion for the likelihood using the principle of maximum
entropy (Jaynes, 1957a,b) as the Gaussian distribution
maximizes the entropy amongst all distributions with the
same mean and variance and can thus be interpreted as
the most conservative in this class of distributions. In-
stead of sampling from the posterior distribution, they
ﬁnd the parameter values that maximize the posterior
distribution. The gravitational waveforms derived via
the inference methods would be compared to a catalog
of simulated waveforms. The catalog would presumably
contain a large number of predicted signals generated by
covering a large volume of the physical parameter space.
To do this, they would compare their estimated wave-
forms to the CCSN gravitational wave signal waveforms
from the catalog of Ott et al. (2004). The assumption is
that the waveform derived from inference would be most
similar to the simulated signal in the catalog which has
physical characteristics most in agreement with the real
CCSN. To quantify the success of the routine, the authors
used a simple cross-correlation between the gravitational
waveforms from inference and the catalog of simulated
CCSN waveforms.

A method using principal component analysis (PCA)
was introduced to decompose the signals in a CCSN grav-
itational wave catalog, and to create an orthonormal ba-
sis vector set (Heng, 2009). With the CCSN catalog
used (Dimmelmeier et al., 2007) (using a large range of
rotation rates) 12 principal component vectors were suﬃ-
cient to reconstruct the catalog waveforms with a match
exceeding 0.9.

The use of PCA was extended in R¨over et al. (2009)
where they used a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler (Gel-
man et al., 2014) to reconstruct CCSN gravitational
waveforms using principal component regression (PCR).
The CCSN catalog that was used had various progen-

itor masses, initial spins, initial diﬀerential spins, and
nuclear equations of state (Dimmelmeier et al., 2008).
The PCA eigenvectors are ﬁrst calculated from the wave-
form catalog. A signal from the catalog (but not used in
creating the PCA eigenvectors) was injected into sim-
ulated LIGO detector noise. With Bayesian inference,
information about the signal was derived. This was ac-
complished by generating the posterior probability dis-
tribution functions of the PCA eigenvector amplitudes
and the pulse arrival time. Attempts were made to use
the reconstructed signal and the amplitudes of the PCA
eigenvectors to give information about the CCSN phys-
ical parameters. The match between the reconstructed
signal and the waveforms from the catalog was quanti-
ﬁed with a χ2 value. This study had limited success in
making a clear association to the physical parameters.

The reconstruction of CCSN signals using Bayesian
PCR was further developed in Edwards (2017) with a
birth-death RJMCMC (Green, 1995). In such an anal-
ysis the number of principal components was not ﬁxed
in advance but treated as an additional parameter to be
estimated. Model selection was addressed via model av-
eraging.

It was subsequently shown in Edwards et al. (2014)
that one can derive important astrophysical information
from the PCA coeﬃcients derived with the PCR meth-
ods described in R¨over et al. (2009). By sampling from
the posterior predictive distribution one can derive cred-
ible intervals for some physical parameters, including the
ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to gravitational en-
ergy of the inner core at the bounce. Two supervised ma-
chine learning methods were also applied so as to classify
the precollapse diﬀerential rotation proﬁle, and it was
shown that the techniques are eﬀective at discriminat-
ing between diﬀerent rapidly rotating progenitors to the
CCSN. The study displayed a constrained optimization
approach for model selection which provided a value for
the appropriate number of principal components for the
Bayesian PCR models.

As decribed in Sec. IV, the estimation of the noise
PSD is critical for gravitational wave parameter estima-
tion. For a short duration transient gravitational wave
signal, the most accurate parameter estimation of the sig-
nal qualities would occur if the noise PSD is estimated
simultaneously with the signal parameters. The study
of Edwards et al. (2015) displays parameter estimation
methods for CCSN while simultaneously estimating the
noise PSD. Often in gravitational wave signal searches
it is assumed that the noise present has a Gaussion dis-
tribution, is stationary, and that the PSD has been de-
termined from observations at a time diﬀerent from that
when a signal is present. However the observed LIGO
and Virgo data can violate these assumptions (Abbott
et al., 2020c). Hence, an incorrect estimation of the
noise PSD would in general aﬀect parameter estimation
results. This was addressed in Edwards et al. (2015)

noise curve, this ﬁgure displays the estimation of the log PSD

ble region, while the posterior median is in dashed blue (line).

where a Bayesian semiparametric method employed a
nonparametric Bernstein polynomial prior for the noise
PSD with weights given from a Dirichlet process distribu-
tion and then the Whittle likelihood provided an update.
A Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler (Gelman et al., 2014)
provided the posterior samples. In addition to the noise
estimation, a rotating CCSN gravitational wave signal
was injected into simulated Advanced LIGO noise, and
the reconstruction parameters were estimated using the
PCR method described in Edwards et al. (2014); R¨over
et al. (2009). An example is displayed in Fig. 19 and
Fig. 20. A CCSN signal (A1O10.25 from the catalog
Abdikamalov et al. (2014)) was injected into simulated
Advanced LIGO noise with SNR = 50. The CCSN signal
was reconstructed, Fig. 20, while simultaneously estimat-
ing the noise PSD, Fig. 19.

The physics behind a CCSN is complicated and com-
plex. The way in which the explosion happens is not
yet totally explained. Diﬀerent models exist, and lead to
diﬀerent parameter estimation results. For example, one
mechanism that has been proposed is a neutrino driven
explosion; this would apply to slowly rotating progeni-
tors. Another possibility is a magnetorotational driven
explosion, which applies for progenitors that are rapidly
rotating. A comprehensive review of CCSN explosion
mechanisms is presented in Janka (2012). The resulting
gravitational wave signals from these mechanisms are dif-
ferent, and could be distinguished by parameter estima-
tion. The study of Logue et al. (2012) showed that one
could diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent magnetorotational
explosion mechanisms. Assuming the Advanced LIGO
sensitivity, they claim that this diﬀerentiation could be
done for CCSN in the Milky (distances less than 10 kpc).
For neutrino driven explosions their method could diﬀer-

51

slowly spinning cores. A Bayesian nested sampling model
selection technique was applied to estimate the diﬀeren-
tial rotation. The Bayesian approach used PCA and ex-
panded on the work of R¨over et al. (2009) and Logue
et al. (2012), and was able to successfully describe the
pre-collapse diﬀerential rotation proﬁle.

A frequentist approach to the problem of parameter
estimation for gravitational waves observed from CCSN
was presented in Engels et al. (2014). PCA is applied to
CCSN waveform catalogs. A least squares solution re-
lates the PCA eigen-solutions and the physical param-
eters. The method was successfully demonstrated for
CCSN signals injected into detector noise, and then iden-
tifying important CCSN parameters that are responsible
for the form of the gravitational wave signal.

The study of Bizouard et al. (2021) used frequentist pa-
rameter estimation methods to address the information
that can be extracted from proto-neutron stars formed af-
ter a CCSN. Speciﬁcally, the information comes from the
observed g-mode signal (gravity modes) (Kokkotas and
Schmidt, 1999). From the time-evolution of the g-mode,
as described in Torres-Forn´e et al. (2019) and potentially
observable in the gravitational wave signal, it was shown
that it is possible to estimate a relationship between the
evolving proto-neutron star (PNS) mass MP N S, and ra-
dius RP N S. They show that one can observe how the
ratio MP N S/R2
P N S evolves with time. The model with
the best ﬁt to the data (time-frequency evolution) is cho-
sen by the Akaike information criterion (Mukhopadhyay
and Ghosh, 2003; Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). Assum-
ing the design sensitivity noise levels for the Advanced
LIGO – Advanced Virgo network, it is stated that the
mass-radius evolution for a PNS could be observable for
sources within the Milky Way. For the third generation
detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Tele-
scope, the observable range could extend to around 100
kpc.

In the study of Edwards (2021) deep convolutional neu-
ral networks were tested on simulated gravitational wave
signals from CCSN with rotating progenitors in order
to determine the nuclear equation of state. The study
used the 1834 gravitational waveforms from Richers et al.
(2017), which were generated from simulations using ax-
isymmetric general-relativistic hydrodynamic scenarios.
These simulations consisted of 98 rotation proﬁles and
18 equations of state. With the convolutional neural net-
work framework of Edwards (2021), which examined the
temporal and visual patterns in the gravitation waves
from rotating CCSN, correct classiﬁcations at the level
of 64% to 72% were achieved. If the signal set is then
reduced to the ﬁve equations of state with the largest
probability estimates for a given test signal, the identi-
faction success rises to 91% to 97%. The eﬀects of the
inclusion of detector noise will be the goal of a future
study using these convolutional neural network methods.
An information-theoretic approach to the detection of

FIG. 20 Displayed here is the reconstruction of a gravitational
wave signal from rotating core CCSN, in particular, the sig-
nal A1O10.25 from Abdikamalov et al. (2014), that was em-
bedded in simulated Advanced LIGO noise with a SNR = 50.
The shaded pink band is the 90% credible interval, the dashed

entiate between diﬀerent models for CCSN source dis-
tances up to 2 kpc. The parameter estimation method
applies PCR and nested sampling (Skilling, 2006); a cal-
culated Bayesian evidence supports the most probable
CCSN mechanism for the explosion. Powell et al. (2016)
continued this line of research with the use of nested sam-
pling for providing evidence for CCSN explosion mech-
anisms. This was tested by embeding simulated signals
in real LIGO detector data in order to understand the
eﬀects of nonstationary and non-Gaussian noise. They
claim with their method the Advanced LIGO - Advanced
Virgo network at design sensitivity could establish if the
mechanism for the explosion is neutrino driven for CCSN
in the galaxy, and rapidly-rotating core collapse to the
Large Magellanic Cloud. Then the subsequent study
presented in Powell et al. (2017) used three-dimensional
CCSN simulations and a means to reject noise transients.
The importance for applying these methods to the data
from third generation gravitational wave detectors was
presented in Roma et al. (2019).

The study of Abdikamalov et al. (2014) presented two
methods to use CCSN produced gravitational wave data
to estimate parameters. One was the total angular mo-
mentum of the inner core at the bounce. Another was
the ratio of the inner core’s rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational energy. Their model for the CCSN included
the eﬀects of rotation, gravitation, electron capture dur-
ing collapse, and the nuclear equation of state. They
also assume noise at the level of Advanced LIGO at de-
sign sensitivity. Their ﬁrst method uses a template bank
from their simulations (124 models) and then they use
matched ﬁltering to estimate the total angular momen-
tum to 20% for rapidly rotating cores, and 25-35% for

unmodeled short-duration transient gravitational wave
signas is presented in Lynch et al. (2017). After a detec-
tion by a short duration transient signal search, parame-
ter estimation is done with MCMC and nested sampling.
Ad-hoc models are used, such as sine-Gaussians, Gaus-
sians and damped sinusoids; the parameters associated
with these models are then estimated. It is claimed that
the generated Bayes Factors can improve the detection
eﬃciency.

The BayesWave analysis pipeline (Cornish and Litten-
berg, 2015; Cornish et al., 2021), described in Sec. X.F,
can be used to reconstruct unmodeled transient gravi-
tational wave signals.
It can also be used to diﬀeren-
tiate between gravitational wave transient signals (co-
herent across the detector network) and transient noise
(incoherent across the detector network). An accurate
reconstruction of the gravitational wave from a CCSN
will certainly be an asset in studies pertaining to under-
standing the signal source.

D. Long Duration Transients

An important potential gravitational wave signal is
a long duration unmodeled transient.
Signal search
pipelines have been developed to look for these signals
in LIGO-Virgo data (Thrane et al., 2011, 2015). These
searches target signals lasting tens of seconds, up to po-
tentially weeks in duration. Pattern recognition methods
are used to search for structure in time-frenquecy maps
produced from the data. Long-duration gravitational
wave signals have been a target for LIGO-Virgo (Abbott
et al., 2018b, 2019h). Coughlin et al. (2014) presented
a method for estimating model parameters from the ob-
served time-frequency map of the data using nested sam-
pling.

This method was further developed to look for grav-
itational wave signals after the merger of a binary neu-
tron star coalescence (Banagiri et al., 2020). Assuming
that there was a massive neutron star remnant that sur-
vived for some time after the merger, there could be oscil-
lations in the remnant, thereby producing gravitational
waves. The production of gravitational waves in such a
scenario is diﬃcult to prediect, especially with respect to
the phase of any oscillation. The study presents a means
to probe for the presence of long duration post-merger
gravitational wave signals, and to put limits on or mea-
sure various properties of the post-merger remnant. A
phase-agnostic likelihood is produced which only uses the
spectral content of the signal. Simulated data with the
O2 Advanced LIGO noise sensitivity is used. The physi-
cal parameters which are attempted to be constrained are
the gravitational wave amplitude, the start time of the
signal, the spin-down timescale, a model dependent spin-
down parameter that can change the overall spin-down
rate, and the initial gravitational wave frequency. It is

52

assumed that the sky position and distance to the source
are known, similar to GW170817. Nested sampling was
used, speciﬁcally the PyMultiNest package of Buchner
et al. (2014). Depending on the models for the post-
merger remnant, the study demonstrates the potential
to constrain various paramereters, such as the ellipticity
of the remnant, or its braking index.

E. Cosmic Strings

Gravitational waves oﬀer an unique way to display new
physics, and one example would be cosmic strings. These
are remnants of a false vacuum, and manifest themselves
as one-dimensional topological defects. If they exist they
would have been made after a spontaneous symmetry
phase transition (Kibble, 1976; Vilenkin and Shellard,
2000). Many diﬀerent ﬁeld theories could be responsi-
ble for producing cosmic strings; Grand Uniﬁed Theories
in the early universe could produce them (Kibble, 1976;
Vilenkin and Shellard, 2000). They could be produced
when inﬂation is terminating (Sakellariadou, 2009).

Cosmic string loops have periodic oscillations, and as
they do so, they produce gravitational waves. The grav-
itational waves are created by cusps, kinks and kink-
kink collisions. The gravitational waveforms are calcula-
ble (Damour and Vilenkin, 2000, 2001, 2005). The grav-
itational wave signals and emitted power depend on the
string tension; this is typically represented as Gµ, where
G is Newton’s constant and µ is the linear mass density
of the string (c = 1 assumed).

Because the waveforms for cosmic string produced
gravitational waves can be calculated, LIGO and Virgo
search for their signals with a template based search. No
such gravitational waves have been detected by LIGO
and Virgo (Abbott et al., 2018e, 2019i, 2021c). The
absence of the detection of a stochastic gravitational
wave background also constrains cosmic string param-
eters (Abbott et al., 2019d, 2018e, 2021c). If a short du-
ration gravitational wave signal from a cosmic string were
detected, parameter estimation methods could certainly
be applied using the know form of the waveforms (Kuroy-
anagi et al., 2012).

Bayesian parameter estimation methods can be used
to constrain cosmic string parameters with the results
from a stochastic gravitational wave background search.
Given a model
for cosmic string formation and the
string tension, a stochastic background can be predicted.
Various diﬀerent cosmic string models M exist (Au-
clair et al., 2019; Blanco-Pillado et al., 2014; Lorenz
et al., 2010) which will produce a stochastic gravita-
tional wave background and an associated energy density,
Ω(M )
GW(fa; Gµ, Nk), that depends on the string tension Gµ,
the frequency fa, and Nk is the number of kinks per cos-
mic string loop oscillation. These would the be inserted

into Eq. 59, using for the parameters Gµ and Nk.

For priors, in the LIGO-Virgo obsering run O3 cosmic

ous ranges of the Gµ

for diﬀerent models (Abbott et al., 2021c). Note that
a cosmic string origin for GW190521 was investigated,
but a log10 Bayes factor of
30 strongly favors a bi-
nary black hole origin for the signal over a cosmic string
origin (Abbott et al., 2020j).

X. PARAMETER ESTIMATION PACKAGES FOR
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES

Here we give a brief description of major software pack-
ages that have been made available for parameter estima-
tion of gravitational waves. This is not an exhaustive list.
Further references to smaller packages or code for speciﬁc
tasks such as spectral density or population parameter
estimation can be found in the respective sections of this
review.

A. LALInference

LALInference (Veitch et al., 2015) is the original and
primary tool that is currently used by LIGO and Virgo
for parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals.
It provides a ﬂexible and open-source toolkit available at
https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/.
It con-
sists of a C library with postprocessing functions imple-
mented in Python. It can make use of all waveform ap-
proximants implemented in the LSC Algorithm Libary
(LAL) and provides implementations of two independent
samplers: a parallel tempering MCMC scheme (Gilks
et al., 1996) and nested sampling (Skilling, 2012).

B. PyCBC

In contrast to LALInference which is written in C, Py-
CBC (Biwer et al., 2019) is a Python-based suite of func-
tions for parameter estimation of compact binary coales-
cence signals.
It is an open-source toolkit available on
GitHub. Several waveform models are available either di-
rectly implemented in PyCBC or via calls to LAL and the
Whittle likelihood function Eq. 6 is used. The user can
choose between three ensemble MCMC samplers: emcee
(Foreman-Mackey et al., 2013),
its parallel-tempered
version ptemcee (Vousden et al., 2015) and kombine,

53

a kernel-density-based, embarassingly parallel ensemble
sampler https://github.com/bfarr/kombine. PyCBC
is also using a dynamical nested sampling algorithm (Nitz
et al., 2021), dynesty (Speagle, 2020).

C. Bilby

The package Bilby is a collection of Python-based
routines for Bayesian parameter estimation of gravita-
tional waveform parameters. It aims to provide a more
user-friendly suite of computational tools than LALIn-
ference through modularisation.
Its core library is not
speciﬁc to the analysis of gravitational waves but can
be used for general parameter estimation problems. The
core library passes user-deﬁned likelihood and prior to
various samplers and returns the results in an hdf5
ﬁle. The Python software package PESummary (Hoy and
Raymond, 2020) can be used for processing and visu-
alising the results. The user has the choice of the
MCMC samplers emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2013),
ptemcee (Vousden et al., 2015), PyMC3 (Salvatier et al.,
2016), and various versions of nested samplers such as
dynesty (the default) (Speagle, 2020), Nestle (Nestle,
2021), CPNest (Veitch et al., 2021), PyMultiNest (Buch-
ner et al., 2014), PyPolyChord (Handley et al., 2015),
UltraNest (Buchner, 2016, 2019), DNest4 (Brewer and
Foreman-Mackey, 2018b), and Nessai (Williams, 2021;
Williams et al., 2021).
Its gravitational wave speciﬁc
library allows the user to deﬁne their own waveform
models but includes standard waveform approximants for
transient signals via the LALSimulation package (LIGO
Scientiﬁc Collaboration, 2018). The standard likelihood
is Eq. 6 and implementations of the current gravita-
tional wave detectors, their location, orientation and
PSDs are provided. A further functionality is provided
by enabling hierarchical Bayesian inference on popula-
tions. A parallelized version of nested sampling imple-
mented in pBilby enables the use of hundreds or thou-
sands of CPUs of a high-performance computing clus-
ter and yields a reduction in computation time that
scales almost linearly with the number of parallel pro-
cesses (Smith et al., 2020) and provides an eﬃcient imple-
mentation for population inference (Talbot et al., 2019).
Bilby also has a MCMC sampler, Bilby-MCMC (Ashton
and Talbot, 2021). A detailed description of this soft-
ware package which is available from the git repository
https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby/, can be found
in Ashton et al. (2019) and Romero-Shaw et al. (2020).

D. BAJES

The Python-based package bajes (Breschi et al., 2021)
implements a Bayesian inference pipeline for compact
binary coalescence transients that has the ﬂexibility to

combine diﬀerent datasets and physical models. Similar
to Bilby, it provides a user-friendly modular software
with minimal dependencies on external libraries but spe-
ciﬁc functionalities for multimessenger astrophysics. Al-
gorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution are
based on emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al., 2013), parallel
tempering MCMC with a variety of proposal distribu-
tions, and nested sampling (Skilling, 2006).

E. RIFT

RIFT stands for Rapid parameter inference on
gravitational wave sources via Iterative FiT-
ting and provides fast methods to infer parameters of
coalescing, precessing compact binary systems. The al-
gorithm is based on original work by Pankow et al.
(2015) and described in detail in Lange et al. (2018) and
O‘Shaughnessy et al. (2017). RIFT achieves a consider-
able saving in computation time by a combination of var-
ious strategies: considering candidate signals on a regular
grid of the parameter space and interpolating the likeli-
hood values over the grid; marginalizing the likelihood
over the extrinsic parameters using an adaptive Monte
Carlo integration scheme; given training data, interpolat-
ing the log marginal likelihood using Gaussian processes;
using an adaptive Monte Carlo method to sample from
the marginal posterior distribution of the intrinsic pa-
rameters; and ﬁnally iterating the ﬁtting and sampling
procedures over revised training data. Using graphical
processing units for some of the elementary operations
of the RIFT algorithm, a further substantial improve-
ment of computation time can be obtained (Wysocki
et al., 2019a). The source code is available at https:
//github.com/oshaughn/research-projects-RIT.

F. BayesWave

Bayeswave is an open-source suite of C++ functions
scripted in Python.
It has been designed to robustly
estimate gravitational wave signals, noise and instru-
mental glitches without relying on any prior assump-
tions of waveform morphology.
Its main importance
lies in the morphology-independent waveform reconstruc-
tion. It is available on GitLab https://git.ligo.org/
lscsoft/bayeswave. BayesWave models instrumental
transients and burst signals using a Morlet-Gabor con-
tinuous wavelet frame where the number and placement
of the wavelets is variable and estimated by a trans-
dimensional RJMCMC algorithm.
It can simultane-
ously estimate the noise power spectral density using
the BayesLine algorithm (Littenberg and Cornish, 2015).
Detailed descriptions of the methodology are given in
Cornish and Littenberg (2015) and Cornish et al. (2021).

G. BAYESTAR

The rapid determination of the source location (sky
position and distance) is of huge importance for multi-
messenger astronomy. BAYESTAR (Singer et al., 2016;
Singer and Price, 2016) provides such a rapid sky-
localization code that yields Bayesian estimates of the
3-dimensional information within minutes. This is ac-
complished by ﬁxing the values of the intrinsic parame-
ters to the values from the detection pipeline, computing
the posterior distribution of the extrinsic parameters and
approximating the marginal posterior distribution of the
sky location via numerical integration. Bayestar exploits
the fact that almost all of the information needed for pro-
ducing a sky position estimate can be extracted from the
matched ﬁter trigger, plus the detectors’ signal arrival
times, amplitudes, and phases. Hence Bayestar need not
use the intrinsic parameters when estimating just the sky
localization.

XI. CONCLUSIONS

Beyond the detection of gravitational waves, Bayesian
statistical methods have played a pivotal part in esti-
mating the physical parameters of gravitational wave-
form models. We have given a comprehensive review
of Bayesian methodology used for parameter estimation
with an in-depth focus on Bayesian computational tech-
niques for characterizing the posterior distribution of
waveform parameters. Simulation-based posterior com-
putation methods in their various forms such as Gibbs
sampling, Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, Hamiltonian
MCMC, adaptive MCMC, RJMCMC, nested sampling,
parallel tempering and combinations thereof have been
the pre-dominant techniques used for estimating the
waveform parameters of signals observed by ground-
based detectors. General methods for accelerating the
convergence of MCMC algorithms (Robert et al., 2018)
as well as reduced order models and surrogate waveform
models (Canizares et al., 2015; Setyawati et al., 2020)
will prove essential for future applications, in particular
for third generation observatories (Smith et al., 2021).
Moreover, the newly emergent machine-learning method-
ology based on neural networks and deep learning oﬀers
promise for gravitational wave applications. For short
burst signals like the black hole mergers that have been
observed by LIGO/Virgo, it has so far been adequate to
estimate the instrumental noise characteristics in terms
of its power spectrum separately from the waveform pa-
rameters and treating the power spectrum as ﬁxed for
the purpose of parameter estimation. State-of-the-art
MCMC methods now also quantify the remaining uncer-
tainty in the spectral density estimates and estimate both
noise power spectrum and waveform parameters simul-
taneously using a semiparametric approach. For longer

duration signals, it will be important in the future to
take the time-varying nature of instrumental noise into
account and develop robust methods for estimating evo-
lutionary spectra. Bayesian methods for checking model
assumptions such as stationarity (Abbott et al., 2020c;
Cornish and Littenberg, 2015; Edwards et al., 2020) and
for assessing model ﬁt such as posterior predictive checks
(Gelman et al., 2014), some of which are already included
in (Abbott et al., 2021f), will need close attention and
further development as tools to scrutinize the validity of
results.

This review includes a summary of results and con-
clusions for the various detections during the ﬁrst three
observations runs of LIGO/Virgo that could be drawn
from parameter estimation. An exhaustive overview of
Bayesian model comparison methods is given and based
on these, conclusions from tests of general relativity are
detailed. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach
and its application to estimating the rates of compact bi-
nary mergers as well as to inference on possible formation
scenarios is explained. With ever increasing sensitivity
of the ground-based detectors, the number of detections
in future observing runs will be surging and hierarchical
Bayesian methods for estimating population parameters
such as their merger rates, mass spectra and spin distri-
butions, will become more and more important.
