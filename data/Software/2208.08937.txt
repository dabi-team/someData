Abstract

→

We perform an analysis of Λb

Λ(1520) local form factors. We use dispersive tech-
niques to provide a model-independent parametrisation of the form factors that can be
used in the whole kinematic region. We use lattice QCD data to constrain the free param-
eters in the form factors expansion, which is further constrained by endpoint relations,
dispersive bounds, and SCET relations. We analyse diﬀerent scenarios, where we expand
the form factors up to diﬀerent orders, and their viability. Finally, we use our results
Λ(1520)(cid:96)+(cid:96)− decays, as the diﬀeren-
to obtain predictions for some observables in Λb
tial branching ratio, the forward-backwards lepton asymmetry and the branching ratio
Λ(1520)γ. Finally, we provide a python notebook based on the software EOS to
of Λb
reproduce our result.

1 Introduction

s(cid:96)+(cid:96)− transitions are an ideal labo-
Flavour Changing Neutral currents mediated through b
ratory to search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Their parametrically suppressed
amplitudes, due to the GIM mechanism, render them a powerful probe of the intrinsic proper-
ties of the Standard Model itself, but also of the New Physics (NP) ones, should it be present.
A key strategy in the study of this type of transitions consists in measuring a large number

mostly at high q2, where q2 is the invariant mass of the dilepton system in the ﬁnal state [1–5],
and also by means of other non-perturbative techniques such as Light-Cone Sum Rules [6, 7].
Experimentally, several measurements have been performed, from total branching fractions to
angular distributions [8–12]. Furthermore, some tensions have been observed when comparing
3.1 standard deviations [13–16].

In light of this, it is essential to assess b-baryon modes to expand our scope of understanding.
While the underlying quark-level transition remains the same with respect to mesons, decays
of baryons have a diﬀerent spin structure. They, therefore, provide the possibility of studying
a richer pattern of observables. From a theoretical point of view, studies of local contributions

to the ground state Λb
Λµ+µ− angular distribution are
[17] and dispersive analysis [18], and measurements of Λb
available in Ref. [19]. However, from an experimental point of view, these decays are challenging
to reconstruct because of the long lifetime
(100 ps) of the weakly decaying Λ particle [19]. This
is not the case of Λ∗ excited states, such as the Λ(1520), which decays strongly. The diﬃculty in
the treatment of Λ∗ excited states arises from the presence of many overlapping resonant states
that need to be disentangled experimentally. Despite this challenge, the Λ(1520) resonance has
the advantage of being fairly narrow [20] and produced in non-negligible quantities [21].

In this work, we perform an analysis of Λb

Λ(1520) local form factors. This transition
has already been studied using various techniques, which, however, are often applicable only in
speciﬁc kinematic regions [22–27]. Up to now, no thorough study of an interpolation between
the latter results that is valid in the whole kinematic region has been provided. We address
this precise issue, providing for the ﬁrst time a parametrisation based on the analyticity of
the form factors, viable in the entire phase space. In other words, our aim is to perform a
pilot study to control the extrapolation uncertainties associated with local form factors. To
ﬁx the coeﬃcients of the form factors expansion, we use the results in Refs. [23, 24], valid
at low recoil (high q2), endpoint relations at low and large recoil (low q2), dispersive bounds
and relations from Soft-Collinear Eﬀective Theory. We use our ﬁndings to perform numerical
studies, providing the values for some observables that can be measured in the near future at
the LHCb experiment [28].

This paper is organised as follows:

in Sect. 2 we propose a form factors parametrisation
based on the conformal mapping onto the complex z plane, and we derive for the ﬁrst time
dispersive bounds for the Λb
Λ(1520) transition; in Sect. 3 we discuss the ﬁt of our parametri-
sation onto the available data; in Sect. 4, we provide predictions for several observables; the
conclusions of this work are drawn in Sect. 5.

2.1 Form factors parametrisation

The analytic properties of the form factors suggest that it is convenient to parametrise them
in terms of the complex variable z, that is deﬁned by the conformal transformation

This setup has been used to work out the so-called BGL parametrisation [32,33], whose success
lies in the model independency of the parametrisation itself. However, for transitions in which
t+ does not coincide with the threshold productions of the hadrons involved, this formalism
needs to be slightly revisited in order to account for the fact that the region where q2 > t+

introduced in Refs. [18, 34], and we closely follow that approach. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.1.
Hence, we parametrise the form factors as

fi(z) =

N
(cid:88)

n=0

afi
n pn(z) ,

(2.17)

where N is the truncation order of the series, and pn are orthonormal polynomials on an arc of
the unit circle, as described in Appendix B. As usual, Pfi(z) is the so-called Blaschke factor,
which captures the contribution of sub-threshold resonances, and reads

Pfi(z) =

(2.18)

where mj are the masses of the sub-threshold resonances listed in Table 2.1 and z∗ is the
complex conjugate of z. Finally, the functions φfi are the so-called outer functions, for which
we give an explicit representation in the next Section. The advantage of this setup is that it
allows to apply dispersive techniques to bound the form factors coeﬃcients in Eq. (2.17), as
illustrated in the next Section.

2.2 Dispersive Bounds

The main idea is to use the dispersive analysis to extract bounds on the form factors parameters
[32, 33, 36]. In this, we follow closely the approach of Ref. [18]. The starting point is the two-
point correlation function:

The above relations are usually addressed as dispersive bounds. The l.h.s. of these inequalities
corresponds to the relative saturation of the bound due to two-particle contributions.
In
principle, one could add to Eq. (2.37) contributions from further two-body states and, in
general, higher multiplicity states. This would render the bounds on the form factor coeﬃcients
that we are interested in extracting even stronger.

the results in Ref. [23] take already into account endpoint relations at q2

reducing the number of independent points to 21.

where r is the saturation of the dispersive bounds, and we use σ = 10%. This matches
the precision of the OPE calculation in Ref. [37].

Endpoint relations: we apply endpoint relations at q2 = 0 as in Eqs. (2.12)–(2.15) and
at q2
max as in Eqs. (2.5)–(2.11). Practically, these relations lower the number of free
parameters, and seven of them are already accounted for in the lattice QCD extrapolation.
We stress that endpoint relations are derived from fundamental properties of the hadronic
amplitudes and are therefore independent of any chosen form factors model.

SCET Relations: we use the fact that at large recoil Soft-Collinear Eﬀective Theory (SCET)
predicts the form factors to be either zero or proportional to a single soft form factor
at leading order in αs/π and leading power in ΛQCD/mb [22, 40–42]. These relations are
needed due to the lack of computation either on the lattice or in Sum-Rule approaches
at large recoil. We apply these relations at q2 = 0 with an uncertainty of 0.2 that
accounts for the unknown next-to-leading order and next-to-leading power corrections.
In principle, this uncertainty is strongly correlated among all form factors. However, the

and we treat the uncertainties as uncorrelated. This corresponds to a conservative as-
sumption, since correlated uncertainties would restrict the available parameter space.

In summary, we have 21 constraints from Lattice QCD calculations, 9 constraints from
SCET relations, and 6 non-linear constraints from the dispersive bounds. We test three ﬁt
scenarios, by ﬁxing in Eq. (2.17) N =
. These three scenarios have 17, 31 and 45
free parameters, respectively, which implies that the N =
cases are under-constrained.
However, the presence of the dispersive bounds ensures bounded posterior distributions despite
the appearance of blind directions.

All the numerical studies are performed using the version 1.0.4 of the EOS software [43, 44].
We use EOS default values for the physical constants, which include the values in Table 3.1. Pos-
terior samples are drawn using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method based on the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm [45, 46]. Since the posterior-predictive samples for the parameters of the z
expansion are usually non-Gaussian distributed, we provide an ancillary notebook that can be
used to reproduce them. Running the notebook requires only an installation of EOS v1.0.4 or
greater1.

In the following, we discuss our ﬁndings. The results are summarized in Table 3.2 and drawn
in Figs. 3.1–3.2. The blue and green bands are obtained by ﬁxing in Eq. (2.17) N =

and we added the N = 3 scenario in red dashed lines. These ﬁt scenarios have diﬀerent

The N = 1 scenario. This parametrisation resembles the one used for the continuum extrap-

Table 3.2: Summary of the ﬁt results for the diﬀerent scenarios. The number of constraints
is the same for all the scenarios, namely 30 linear constraints, and 6 non-linear ones. Since
the bounds provide non-linear constraints on the parameters, the corresponding test statistic

scenario. This is expected since lattice QCD data are only available at very high q2. It
is also evident from Figs. 3.1–3.2 that the N = 1 scenario massively underestimates the
uncertainties at large recoil for some of the form factors. Concerning the saturations of
the two-particle contributions to the dispersive bounds, they all peak between 5 and 10%,
except the one associated with the pseudo-tensor current which saturates the inequality.

The N = 2 scenario. This scenario is characterised by a number of free parameters larger
than the number of constraints. Hence, we are unable to provide a global value for the
ﬁt quality. The ﬁt to lattice QCD data and the full set of endpoint relations, yields
χ2 = 0 at the best-ﬁt point. However, the latter violates the dispersive bounds massively.
Performing then the ﬁt including all constraints, namely adding SCET relations and
the dispersive bounds, we obtain in the minimum χ2 = 24. However, this cannot be
interpreted with a p-value, since we have a negative number of degrees of freedom. It is
anyway useful to mention that the χ2 at the best-ﬁt point associated with the constraints

Since the number of constraints due to the lattice data is 21, this is equivalent to a
satisfactory, individual p-value of 31% for the lattice points only for N = 2. Since the
other constraints are equally satisﬁed, we conclude that the N = 2 scenario shows an
overall better agreement with the data. In this case, having more free parameters than
constraints makes the dispersive bound essential and, therefore, leads to larger relative
saturations.

∼

The N = 3 scenario. This model has even a larger number of free parameters, allowing a
perfect ﬁt to lattice QCD data, the full set of endpoint relations and SCET relations.
Also in this case, the ﬁt results, however, massively violate the dispersive bounds. Adding
the latter as constraints, we obtain a individual p-value for the lattice points of 55%. As
visible in Figs. 3.1–3.2, the 68% C.L. bands overlaps perfectly with the one for N = 2
results. This means that the uncertainties are saturated due to the fact that the free
parameters are all constrained by the dispersive bounds. We expect this property to be
equally veriﬁed by N > 3 scenarios. Concerning the saturations, similar conclusions as
for the N = 2 case apply.

Comparing our ﬁndings, we conclude that none of the scenarios is fully satisfactory, because
a tension between lattice QCD data and the dispersive bounds remains. Our results clearly
indicate that N = 1 scenario is ill-suited for an extrapolation of the lattice QCD results to small
q2. For N > 1 however, the negative number of degrees of freedom ensures the uncertainties
to be completely driven by the dispersive bounds. The latter, therefore, already accounts for
the truncation error of the parametrisation and is resistant to any residual model uncertainty.
Despite the residual tension, we can thus set N = 2 as our nominal ﬁt for the phenomenology
applications and, with the current data, considering higher extrapolation orders will not modify
our results nor the attached uncertainties.

We emphasize that our approach is systematically improvable by computations of the form
factors in the large-recoil region. For example, future lattice simulations that extend to lower q2
values will provide means to extract more precise information on the higher order coeﬃcients,
possibly also removing the aforementioned current tension. Since the N = 2, 3 scenarios show
s transitions would help
a saturation of the dispersive bound, a global analysis of all b
reduce the uncertainties on all the form factors.

We use now the results in Sect. 3 to predict the above observables. We stress that we use
as nominal ﬁt results for the form factors parameters the N = 2 scenario. We plot diﬀerential
distributions in Fig. 4.1. As already mentioned, we veto the c¯c resonant region (8 GeV2 < q2 <
15 GeV2), but we show for completeness the naive extrapolation in the resonances region with
dashed lines.
In the left upper panel of Fig. 4.1, we show the diﬀerential branching ratio. We compare our
results with the literature [22, 26, 27] and ﬁnd some discrepancies. We notice that the order of
magnitude of our prediction of the diﬀerential branching ratio diﬀers, in the entire q2 range,
from the one quoted in Ref. [22]. We then compare with the most recent measurement of
pKµ+µ−) in Ref. [55], ﬁnding a good agreement between the order of magnitude of

the latter and our predictions, even though the various Λ∗
Furthermore, we also see a diﬀerence in the branching ratio as a function of q2 at very large
recoil. We trace back this diﬀerence to the diﬀerent form factor parametrisation. We veriﬁed
explicitly that the Quark Model predictions in their current form violate SCET relations at
low q2 as well as the dispersive bounds, even of more than an order of magnitude for some
currents. Without a reasonable estimation of the uncertainties and correlations of the Quark
Model parameters, it is impossible to extract more meaningful information. Also, for some of
the form factors, lattice QCD results and Quark Model ones are not in good agreement close
to zero-recoil.
Finally, we observe that the lack of theory points for the form factors at large recoil results
in large uncertainties. We stress that due to this, the shape of the diﬀerential branching
ratio in the central q2 region could be qualitatively diﬀerent when new lattice data or QCD
Sum Rule-based computation will be available. This model dependency is less evident in the
diﬀerential forward-backwards asymmetry, right panel of Fig. 4.1. We note that, diﬀerently

Λ(1520) local form factors which respects
In this work, we present a parametrisation of Λb
the analytical properties and the dispersive bounds associated with local b
s currents. With
this setup, we are able to evaluate for the ﬁrst time dispersive bounds for the form factor
coeﬃcients. We determine the form factor parameters through ﬁts to theory data from Lattice
QCD, with constraints from endpoint relations, SCET relations, and dispersive bounds.
We study the consequences of expanding the form factors up to diﬀerent orders, ﬁnding that
the minimal viable scenario is a second-order expansion, and additional orders does not add
any information. Hence, we use this ﬁt scenario as the nominal one. Our results can be easily
reproduced using EOS and the python notebook provided as an ancillary ﬁle.
We provide predictions for diﬀerential and integrated branching ratio and leptonic forward-
Λ(1520)(cid:96)+(cid:96)− decays, where (cid:96) is a light lepton, and also an
backward asymmetry for Λb
Λ(1520)γ). We stress that our approach suﬀers from large uncertainties at
update for
(Λb
low q2, due to the lack of calculations of the form factors in that region. It is, hence, of the
utmost importance to focus on that to improve predictions of Λb

Λ(1520) form factors.
