Abstract. The study of quantum heat transport in superconducting circuits is
signiﬁcant for further understanding the connection between quantum mechanics and
thermodynamics, and for possible applications for quantum information. The ﬁrst
experimental realisations of devices demonstrating photonic heat transport mediated
by a qubit have already been designed and measured. Motivated by the analysis
of such experimental results, and for future experimental designs, we numerically
evaluate the photonic heat transport of qubit-resonator devices in the linear circuit
regime through electromagnetic simulations using Sonnet software, and compare with
microwave circuit theory. We show that the method is a powerful tool to calculate
heat transport and predict unwanted parasitic resonances and background.

thermodynamics of a quantum system interacting with dissipative environments,
theorised and/or realised in the platform of superconducting and normal-metal
circuits [1]. Understanding the processes underpinning thermal transport in such
mesoscopic structures has signiﬁcant potential to further our understanding of quantum
thermodynamics [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and for applications in quantum information devices,
for example in the circuit’s heat management [7, 8]. Superconducting circuits present a
practical, controllable platform in which to realise such quantum thermal devices [9, 10].
Josephson-junction elements form quantum bits (qubit) or multi-level systems that can
be strongly and controllably tuned to interact with microwave photons stored in a
superconducting resonator [11, 12]. The inclusion of resistive normal-metal elements in

the resonator, whose electronic temperature can be controlled and monitored, provides
sources of thermal photons and, acts as a sensor of transferred power. The ﬁeld’s
focus ranges from photonic heat transport, operation of quantum heat engines and
refrigerators and calorimetry of single photons.

Rapid development in the ﬁeld of cQTD have seen the realisation of practical
heat transport devices, advancing our understanding of quantum thermodynamics.
Experiments have measured photonic heat ﬂow between two resistors through a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) in various conﬁgurations,
indicating quantum limited photonic thermal conductance [13, 14, 15, 16]. This
quantum-limited heat conduction is also observed across two resistors separated by
1 meter transmission line long distance [17]. Further eﬀorts saw studies of the heat ﬂux
mediated by a qubit embedded between two microwave cavities. By utilising symmetric
and asymmetric resonators, this led to the realisation of the ‘quantum heat valve’ (QHV)
[18] and ‘quantum heat rectiﬁer’ (QHR) [19] respectively. More recently, by coupling
a third microwave cavity to a ﬂux qubit, heat transport in a three-terminal device has
been realised [20].

As the ﬁeld of cQTD matures and is advancing, it becomes increasingly important
for experimentalists to have the practical tools they need to accurately design the next
generation of quantum heat devices. Until now, models of quantum heat transport
have focused on so-called ‘lumped-element’ approximations [20, 21], treating structures
as ideal rather than considering a speciﬁc full geometry. Furthermore, in the limit of
strong coupling to the dissipative elements, the eﬀects of coherence are suppressed and
circuits can be modelled using linearised circuit elements, with remarkable success [21].
In this work, we present a guide towards simulating heat transport in cQTD
platforms employing the ﬁnite-element method (FEM) within the software package
Sonnet [22]. Sonnet is a software package which can solve electromagnetic propagation
in planar structures using a ﬁnite element method, and is widely utilised to design
superconducting circuits. For example, it has been used to eﬃciently determine the
quality factor and resonance frequency of a superconducting micro-resonator [23],
simulating radiation loss in a superconducting circuit sensor [24], and for designing
Inspired by the use of FEM methods in
an on-chip superconducting ﬁlter [25, 26].
designing quantum processing units in the ﬁeld of quantum information processing, we
describe the ﬁrst applications of such techniques to the design of quantum thermal
hardware. More speciﬁcally, we simulate a QHV device using a FEM method, and
precisely predict the expected heat currents. We go on to compare our results to the
distributed microwave circuit theory. In the future, much more complicated systems are
expected to exist to realise such quantum heat engines.

2. Heat Transport through a Linear Circuit

Here we consider a generalised two-port thermal device to compute the heat transport
across the device. The internal structure of the device can in-principle contain any

and R2 with temperatures T1, T2. Heat is then exchanged between the two resistors
via microwave photons generated by the Johnson-Nyquist noise in the resistors. (b)

combination of qubits, resonators, on-chip ﬁlters, capacitors, inductors, etc., which we
call the ‘black-box’, situated between an input and output microwave-port that are
terminated by resistors R1 and R2. Both of them generate a source voltage spectrum,
SVSn (f ), for n = 1, 2. At ﬁnite temperature due to thermal agitations [27, 28], the metal
resistor produces a voltage spectral density from the ﬂuctuations given by [10]

which is a Landauer type equation [29, 30], where τ (f ) = |S21(f )|2 is photon
transmission coeﬃcient. We now see that solving the heat ﬂow through an arbitrary
black-box can be reduced to simply solving its scattering parameters.
In a superconducting circuit, in the case of a QHV of Ref.

[18], the black-box
consists of two symmetric transmission lines (TLs) capacitively coupled to a transmon
qubit. Here, the terminating resistors at both ends of TLs deﬁne the boundary condition
for the voltage node. Thus, the resistor-terminated TLs act as a λ/4 resonator with its
open-circuit end hosting the voltage antinode to couple to the qubit. The source of
microwave radiation for the QHV circuit is this normal-metal resistor shorting each
λ/4 resonator to the ground-plane. The transmon qubit consists of a metal island
shunted by a Josephson junction, with island total capacitance CΣ and charging energy
EC = e2/2CΣ. Here, the non-linear SQUID is replaced by an inductor LJ with
impedance

ZJ (δ, ω) = jωLJ (δ) = jω

Φ0

(6)

where δ, Φ0 and ICΣ are the eﬀective phase across the SQUID, magnetic-ﬂux quantum
and total critical current of the SQUID junctions respectively. The parameter d is the
critical current asymmetry [31]

d =

IC1 − IC2
IC1 + IC2

,

(7)

where IC1 and IC2 are the critical currents of the two SQUID junctions. The inductor
stores the Josephson energy EJ (δ) = (Φ0/2π)2(1/LJ (δ)). In this linearized picture, the
transmon qubit is represented as an ideal harmonic oscillator with frequency

fQ(δ) =

(cid:112)8EJ (δ)EC

(8)

thus ignoring the in-built weak anharmonicity of the qubit.

When the island is shunted by two parallel Josephson junctions, the phase δ is
magnetic-ﬂux dependent δ = πΦ/Φ0. Figure 1(b) shows a schematic representation of
the QHV circuit, with the corresponding frequencies and rates shown. To simulate in
the linear regime, we transform this to a black-box terminated by port-impedances, as
shown in Fig. 1(a).

3. Determining the scattering parameter S21(f )

The scattering parameters of a linear circuit can be calculated by various methods.
In the lumped element approximation, at low temperatures, when the thermal photon
wavelength is much longer than the typical dimension of the circuit, the transmission
coeﬃcient τ between the two resistors can be derived by standard circuit approach
[32, 33]: τ (f ) = R1R2/|Zt(f )|2, where Zt(f ) is the total series impedance of the circuit.
In a typical resonator-qubit system, depending on the type and resonance frequency of
the resonator, for example for λ/4 resonator with fr ∼ 8 GHz, the photon wavelength
λ ∼ 15 mm is already comparable with the typical size of the resonator-qubit-resonator
structure. This can be modelled, as in Refs. [21, 20], taking into account the distributed
elements of the resonators, while still treating capacitors as a lumped element.

Here we propose a method to solve the transmission coeﬃcient with FEM by using
Sonnet to take into account full circuit reactive elements and their possible parasitics.
In Sonnet, for the FEM simulations, the resistive elements correspond to the port-

impedance can have an arbitrary combination of resistive and reactive elements, that can
be varied to solve the transmission of the circuit (see in Appendix B for more discussion
about ports in Sonnet). Here we vary only resistive elements and set the reactances to
be zero. By doing this we can get the transmission of the full circuit as varying the
terminating resistances.

As a benchmark, we also solve the transmission of the circuit using the individual
distributed circuit elements, by constructing the ABCD matrix of the black-box and
converting to its scattering parameters. The ABCD matrix of the entire circuit is then
found by computing the product of the corresponding ABCD matrices of each of the
constituting circuit elements [34]

admittance of the parallel elements (see the discussions in Appendix A). For example,
when the ports are directly connected, without any series or parallel impedances, with
port termination R1 and R2, the matrix elements are A = 1, B = 0, C = 0, D = 1. Thus
the photon transmission probability τ (f ) = |S21(f )|2 = 4R1R2/(R1 + R2)2.

4. Heat Transport through a Superconducting Quarter-Wave Resonator

To demonstrate this approach, we ﬁrst consider the simple-case of heat transport
through a superconducting λ/4 resonator. The circuit consists of a resistor, R, at port-1
terminating a 6 GHz λ/4 resonator. The open end of the resonator capacitively couples
to a short TL terminated by a matched 50 Ω resistor at port-2. In this way, we ﬁnd
the scattering parameters, S21(f ), as a function of the terminating resistor at port-1,
and eventually the total power transfer to port-2. Due to the simplicity of the circuit,
ABCD methods and Sonnet can be compared directly as methods for determining the
heat ﬂow. Figure 2(a) and (b) shows the schematic and Sonnet conﬁguration of the
corresponding circuit. The presented superconducting structure is approximated to be
a zero-thickness metal with perfect conductance. The dielectric stack-up consists of a
vacuum layer (dielectric constant (cid:15) = 1) above the metal layer, and a 670 µm silicon
((cid:15) = 11.5) layer below the metal with zero dielectric loss. The Sonnet simulation of the
scattering parameters is then performed for a range of terminating resistors, and the
results are shown as the solid-lines in Fig. 2(c).

The scattering parameters can be correspondingly calculated using the product of
the ABCD matrices for the individual elements. The product is given by the three

resultant product is converted to S21 using Eq. 10, and shown as the dashed-lines in
Fig. 2(b) demonstrating excellent agreement between the FEM and ABCD methods for
all values of resistances. The total integrated power transfer, calculated using Eq. 5, as
a function of resistance R at port-1 is shown in the Fig. 2(b) inset.

√

In the case of this simple circuit the role of parasitic couplings and modes are
minimised, and the scattering parameters are well approximated by the ABCD matrices
of the individual components. As circuits become increasingly complex, parasitic
capacitances and inductances can no-longer be neglected and the ABCD approach is
expected to diverge from the true circuit response. A major advantage however, is
that the Sonnet simulation is performed without recourse to any knowledge about the
circuit components, only inputting the design ﬁle and desired resistance. Conversely,
the ABCD method requires the additional steps of simulating the coupling capacitance,
and characteristic impedance using an external program.

5. Quantum Heat Valve: A qubit coupled to two superconducting
resonators

Having demonstrated the validity of the linear FEM simulations to simulate heat ﬂow,
we move to the more complex case of the QHV, inspired by the experimental work [18].
The QHV consists of a superconducting transmon qubit, coupled to two superconducting
λ/4 resonators of equal frequency. The transmon qubit frequency is tunable using a
global ﬂux bias to modulate the Josephson inductance of a superconducting-quantum-
interference-device (SQUID). We approximate the transmon qubit, considering only the
linear response, by replacing the SQUID loop with an ideal lumped inductor within the
Sonnet interface. Figure 3(a) and (b) show the circuit schematic and Sonnet setup for
such simulations, with the inset showing the tunable inductor representing the transmon
SQUID. Ports are placed at each of the short-ends of the λ/4 resonators, and the port
impedance set to the desired resistor value. The metallic layer is assumed to be lossless
and have zero intrinsic inductance, and the ground planes are connected to the box-
wall such that the impedance to ground is zero at the boundary. Additionally, a small
CJJ = 10 fF capacitor is added between the transmon island and the ground-plane, to
account for the 0.2 µm2 area junction capacitance.

The Josephson inductance is calculated by Eq. 6, for each value of the simulated
phase, δ = πΦ/Φ0. The S-parameters are simulated using Sonnet. The results of
a typical simulation as a function of ﬂux are shown in the colour axis of Fig. 3(c),
with R1 = R2 = 0.1 Ω for visual clarity. The interaction of the qubit with the two
resonators is shown clearly by the two avoiding crossings occurring each period. By
ﬁtting the eigenenergies using the SCQubits package [36], shown by the white dashed
lines (Eq. C.2), we can further extract the qubit-resonator coupling 100 MHz, and
charging energy Ec/h = 147 MHz in excellent agreement with the experimental value
150 MHz.

To compute the power transferred, we ﬁrst convert the S21 to the one-sided net
power transfer spectrum at the second resistor by SPnet = hf |S21(f )|2(n1(f ) − n2(f )),
shown in Fig. 3(d) for two values of the ﬂux. Note, that we set the port resistance to
R1 = R2 = 12 Ω, corresponding to a quality factor Q1 = Q2 = 3.1, matching the ﬁtted
experimental values. The yellow solid line indicates the power spectra when the valve is
in the open position, and the blue line when the valve is in the closed position. The inset
shows a zoom of the data when the valve is in the closed position. The Lorentzian shape
is therefore created by the spectral ﬁltering of the resonators around 5.6 GHz. The total
power transferred is then naturally obtained by integrating the power spectral density
over all frequencies. The power as a function of ﬂux for three temperature bias values
is shown as the solid lines Fig.3(e). For all curves, the temperature of the drain-side is
ﬁxed at T2 = 120 mK.

For comparison, we again compute the scattering parameters using a linearised

ABCD product of each corresponding element. The product is given by

where ZC and ZJ are the lumped impedances representing the qubit shunting
capacitance (Cs), and Josephson inductance respectively (parallel LC circuit). The
calculated circuit model is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 3(d) for comparison. To
compare, the coupling capacitances and qubit charging energy are simulated using
COMSOL. The Josephson energy, EJ = 37 GHz (ICΣ = 72 nA) and critical current
asymmetry d = 0.08 are taken to be the same in both models. Total power transfer
is again calculated by integrating the simulated S21 over the full frequency range
using Eq. 5. The two models demonstrate in general excellent quantitative agreement.
However at integer values of the ﬂux quanta, where the power transfer is maximised,
there is some discrepancy between the models.
In general, the circuit method using
COMSOL capacitance values overestimates the power transfer compared to the more

Electromagnetic Simulation of Heat Transport in Superconducting Qubits

10

precise Sonnet method. We attribute this discrepancy to a more accurate estimation of
the qubit-resonator coupling by Sonnet when compared to COMSOL. This is because
the coupling capacitor in Sonnet is treated as a distributed element whilst in the ABCD
model it is assumed to be a lumped element.

Comparing to the experimental data from Ref.

[18], shown by the solid orange
line, we ﬁnd excellent qualitative agreement, suggesting that the linearised model
simulates the dynamics well. The measurements observed an overall lower peak power
modulation of ∆Pnet = 0.21 fW, versus the simulated ∆Pnet = 0.29 fW for the same
nominal experimental parameters. The observed discrepancy comes partly from the
non-linearity caused by the weak anharmonicity of the transmon qubit, and as such
the populations of the quantized energy levels play a non-negligible role in ﬁltering
the power-transfer in such experiments. Alternatively, elements of the fabrication, or
measurement environment, e.g. sample holder, measurement wiring and wirebonding,
can play a role in determining the overall magnitude of the heat ﬂow, something we will
further explore. Overall, the close agreement obtained between the experiment and the
simulations is remarkable considering the simpliﬁed model, and lack of free parameters
when constructing the simulation.

Sonnet simulations allow quantitative estimations of the background heat ﬂow due
to photons in superconducting circuits. By looking at the oﬀ-resonant heat ﬂow (Φ/Φ0 =
0.5) we can observe that net power ﬂow is almost zero when compared with the resonant
heat ﬂow.
In-fact, we calculate the modulation ratio (P (Φ)max − P (Φ)min/P (Φ)max)
from the Sonnet simulations to be 0.95 ± 0.02, in stark contrast to that seen in recent
experimental results. From this we would conclude that the majority of the observed
background heat ﬂow in experiments is due to phonons, which are not considered
by Sonnet. However, the picture can become more complex when we consider the
possible variation or grounding potential of the measurement environment. Here so far
we simulate the circuit in the ideal situation where the ground plane of the circuit is
connected to the box-wall.

To further explore how the measurement environment can aﬀect the unmodulated
background in such circuits we consider a similar QHV device in a variety of
measurement conﬁgurations. We realise this by altering the connections from the circuit
ground-plane to the so-called ‘box-wall’, which sets the simulation ground potential.
This allows us to simulate the real eﬀect of various measurement conﬁgurations.
Figure 4(a) shows such a simulation conﬁguration with the ground-plane short to the
box-wall using four lossless connections, emulating for example four superconducting
wire bonds directly to the sample-holder ground. Note that the qubit coupler design is
simpliﬁed with-respect-to Fig. 3 to allow for faster simulation.

The Sonnet simulations here point to a clear eﬀect of an imperfect measurement
environment on the photonic heat-ﬂow. Figure 4(b) shows the integrated heat-
ﬂow between the two-resistors as a function of ﬂux, for four diﬀerent measurement
environments. The red, green and orange curves show the eﬀect of an increasing
number of zero-resistance wire-bonds to the chip. The blue curve represents a grounding

increased impedence to ground contributes to a higher oﬀ-resonant heat ﬂow, evidenced
by the increase in the background heat ﬂow. Secondly, the absolute magnitude of the
modulation is also aﬀected, with ∆Pnet reducing 20% as the number of bonds is reduced
from six to one. Lastly, the apparent shape of the modulation is also inﬂuenced, with the
peak caused by the qubit interaction reducing due to competition with the background
modes. In the extreme case of the blue curve, the total heat-ﬂow is highest when the
qubit is oﬀ-resonance, a π-phase shift of the QHV characteristics.

The source of this behaviour is clear when we look at the oﬀ-resonance (Φ = 0.5)

|S21| transmission for the diﬀerent cases, as shown in Fig. 4(c). With fewer connections,
the ground-plane allows for the propagation of signiﬁcant background modes, seen
increasing in amplitude from the green, orange and blue curves. Note that the exact
background modes and their amplitude depend signiﬁcantly on the physical position
of the bonds on the chip. The interaction between the tunable QHV modes and
the parasitic modes results in the phase shift of heat-valve behaviour. Moreover, the
increased background results in a reduced modulation ratio, as seen in Fig. 4(d).

Simply changing the measurement environment can lead to an order-of-magnitude
reduction in the modulation ratio, although the absolute modulation is left unaﬀected.
This cements the importance of maintaining a precise environment in the measurements
in order to study the quantum thermal device performance. Such eﬀects may shed
further light on some recent experimental results which report modulation which could
not be easily explained within a circuit framework [19, 20].

6. Double Pole Quantum Heat Valve: Two qubits between two
superconducting resonators

With the methods well established, we can now use our toolbox to design the next
generation of quantum heat devices. One example of this could be a double-pole
quantum heat valve. The QHV can be further expanded upon by replacing the single
qubit with two strongly-coupled transmon qubits. The device therefore consists of two
quarter-wavelength resonators of equal frequency 5.6 GHz, each coupled to an transmon
qubit, which are strongly coupled to each other. The schematic, and device layout in
Sonnet are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The charging energies and Josephson energies
of the two qubits are designed to be equal. The two resonant frequencies corresponding
to these qubits can be characterised by a global ﬂux bias. Conversely, by using local
ﬂux biases the frequencies of the qubits can be tuned independently, and a two-pole
photonic heat switch can be realised. Such a device serves as a building-block towards
complex logic involving photonic heat currents, since it converts two inputs to a single
output.

The simulation result in Fig. 5(c) when the two qubits are tuned with equal ﬂux,
and shows a mode structure of the device is similar to the QHV. Here we set the same
Josephson energy EJ = 37 GHz (ICΣ = 72 nA) for both qubits, which implies that
they also have the same resonant frequency at all values of the ﬂux bias, therefore the
coupled qubits form hybridised modes. The resonator mode is identical with the single-
qubit QHV, but instead of a single frequency qubit mode, the strong coupling between
the qubits splits the shared resonance frequency into two. Again, using the SCQubits
package we can extract the device parameters directly from the S21 simulation. We
ﬁnd the qubit charging energy to be EC/h = 250 MHz, the qubit-qubit coupling to
be gαβ = 200 MHz, and the qubit-resonator coupling g1α = g2β = 120 MHz. The
cross-coupling terms g12 = g1β = g2α ∼ 0 within the ﬁtting error.

We determine the heat current in this two-qubit device using Eq. 5, as a function

of the ﬂux applied to each of the qubits, as shown by the colour axis in Fig. 5(d).
Four high power peaks are seen when both qubits are tuned close to the resonator at
Φi/Φ0 ≈ ±0.4. As expected, if either qubit is detuned to a half-integer ﬂux point, then
the power remains small over the full ﬂux range of the other qubit. In this way, the
system is acting as a double-pole heat switch. The 1D slices of the 2D data corresponding
to three values of the second qubit ﬂux, indicated by the dashed lines, are shown in

Similar to the previous comparisons, we estimate the capacitances with COMSOL and
convert the ABCD matrix to the S-parameter S21, which is then integrated according to
Eq. 5. The models again show excellent agreement over the full ﬂux range. Such a device
could be practically realised using current fabrication and measurement techniques.
Furthermore, it could serve as a test-bed for investigating the eﬀects of qubit coherence
on heat-ﬂow [37].

7. Conclusions

We have demonstrated the ﬁrst applications of FEM simulations to improve the design
of photonic heat devices and calculate heat transport in superconducting circuits. We
ﬁrst established the technique and theory, showing that such simulations can calculate
the scattering parameters of an arbitrary geometry, and predict the expected heat
transport properties. We use our tools to predict the heat current across a simple
quarter-wavelength resonator terminated by a normal-metal resistor, ﬁnding excellent
agreement with established circuit models. We then predicted the heat currents at
various temperatures in a QHV device, consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to
two quarter-wavelength resonators, ﬁnding quantitative agreement within
30% of
experimental data.

We show that Sonnet can naturally predict and include any unwanted parasitic
modes in the calculations. The ability to consider the speciﬁc geometry is highly
useful to design further more complex quantum heat transport devices. This is clearly
evidenced by the strong dependence of the photonic heat background on the simulated
measurement environment, which has been investigated. We show that the electrical
environment can inﬂuence not just the magnitude of the power transfer, but can even
reverse the properties of the tunable heat valve. We go on to utilise our tool to design a
more complex two-pole heat valve using two transmon qubits. Such a structure has not
been previously realised, and presents a step towards realising logical operations using
photonic heat currents.

Moreover, the technology shown here can easily be extended to an arbitrary number
of heat-baths by including more ports, allowing predictions to be made about structures
with four or more ports. Our framework is currently limited by the linearity of the
Sonnet FEM method. In the future, by combining non-linear solvers [38] with FEM

Electromagnetic Simulation of Heat Transport in Superconducting Qubits

15

simulations one could, in principle, model superconducting qubits with greater accuracy
than is done here. Using such solvers, one could perhaps create heat rectiﬁers, isolators
and circulators using FEM as the core design tool. The toolbox we establish here lays
the foundations for rapid prototyping of new photonic heat devices, and allows the ﬁeld
of cQTD to move towards increased complexity and reproducibility.

Appendix A. ABCD Matrix to H(f ) and S21(f )

The transfer function H(f ) can be represented in terms of the ABCD parameters by
applying Kirchoﬀ’s voltage law and the deﬁnition of the ABCD matrix to the circuit
shown in Fig. A1. First, by Kirchoﬀ’s voltage law:

VL = V2 = I2R2,
VS = I1R1 + V1,

where Vi and Ii, i ∈ {1, 2}, are the voltage and the current at node i+.

Second, by the deﬁnition of the ABCD matrix:

V1 = AV2 + BI2,
I1 = CV2 + DI2.

(A.1)

(A.2)

Electromagnetic Simulation of Heat Transport in Superconducting Qubits

Hence,

H(f ) =

VS

I2R2
R1I1 + V1

AR2 + B + CR1R2 + DR1

.

(A.3)

To derive a representation for the S-parameter S21(f ), we ﬁrst calculate the input

S11 =

Zin − R1
Zin + R1

=

A + B/R2 − CR1 − D(R1/R2)
A + B/R2 + CR1 + D(R1/R2)

.

The voltage V1 can now be written in the form:

V1 = V −

(A.7)

where the factor (cid:112)R1/R2 comes from using the power normalisation convention
|S11|2 + |S21|2 = 1. Substituting the formulas for V1, V2 and S11 yields

S21(f ) =

2(cid:112)R1/R2
A + B/R2 + CR1 + (R1/R2)D

,

(A.8)

which results in the same formula as in Ref. [39]. Furthermore, the comparison between
Eq. A.3 and Eq. A.8 shows that

An important special case of Eq. A.8 occurs when the circuit inside the ‘black-box’

consists only of series components. Then the ABCD matrix is given by

where ZB is the total series impedance of the black-box. Substituting this form into Eq.
A.8 gives

|S21(f )|2 =

4R1R2
|R1 + R2 + ZB|2 ,

(A.11)

which agrees with the formula derived in Ref. [33] through a diﬀerent method.

Similarly, we can consider a black-box in which all the components are connected

in parallel. In this case

where 1/ZB is total admittance of the parallel elements of the black-box. Again, the
substitution into Eq. A.8 yields a useful simpliﬁcation

|1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/ZB|2 ,

(A.13)

which has been derived and used in Ref.
Josephson junction.

[21] to study the heat transport across a

Importantly, Eq. A.11 and Eq. A.13 can also be applied in the case of complex
terminating impedances, if the reactive/susceptive components are included into the
black-box. Writing the complex forms explicitly gives

and

|S21(f )|2 =

4Re[Z1]Re[Z2]
|Z1 + Z2 + ZB|2

|S21(f )|2 =

4Re[1/Z1]Re[1/Z2]
|1/Z1 + 1/Z2 + 1/ZB|2 ,

(A.14)

(A.15)

where Z1 and Z2 are the complex terminating impedances.

Appendix B. Ports in Sonnet

The port structure in Sonnnet consists of a voltage source in series with a normalising
impedance component as shown in Fig. B1(a). By default, the port impedance has only
a resistive component R = 50 Ω. The setting can be overwritten by the user, and in
our simulations we change and vary the resistive component R while keeping the other
component values at zero (Fig. B1(b)). Additionally to the resistor R, here we can
also set a value of shunting capacitor C, series reactance X and series inductor L. This
option is important in the situation when the dimension of the resistor is signiﬁcant and
it cannot be assumed as a lumped element anymore, and the resistor’s geometry starts
to aﬀect the wave propagation across it.

be set to in any combination of resistive and reactive elements. For our heat transport
study, we only set and vary the resistive value R, that terminates the circuit (+) to
