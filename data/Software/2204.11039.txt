Abstract

Context: Research collaborations between software engineering industry and
academia can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts to both sides, including improved in-
novation capacity for industry, and real-world environment for motivating and
validating research ideas. However, building scalable and eﬀective research col-
laborations in software engineering is known to be challenging. While such
challenges can be varied and many, in this paper we focus on the challenges of
achieving participative knowledge creation supported by active dialog between
industry and academia and continuous commitment to joint problem solving.
Objective: This paper aims to understand what are the elements of a suc-
cessful industry-academia collaboration that enable the culture of participative
knowledge creation. Method: We conducted participant observation collecting
qualitative data spanning 8 years of collaborative research between a software
engineering research group on software V&V and the Norwegian IT sector. The
collected data was analyzed and synthesized into a practical collaboration model,
named the Certus Model. Results: The model is structured in seven phases,
describing activities from setting up research projects to the exploitation of re-
search results. As such, the Certus model advances other collaborations models
from literature by delineating diﬀerent phases covering the complete life cycle of
participative research knowledge creation. Conclusion: The Certus model de-
scribes the elements of a research collaboration process between researchers and
practitioners in software engineering, grounded on the principles of research
knowledge co-creation and continuous commitment to joint problem solving.
The model can be applied and tested in other contexts where it may be adapted
to the local context through experimentation.

1. Introduction

Industry-academia collaborations in software engineering (SE) have been an
important discussion topic in the SE community for many years. This is because
research collaborations between SE industry and academia, if managed success-
fully, can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts to both sides, such as improved innovation
capacity for industry [1], and real-world environment for validating research
outputs [2] as well as building new areas of research expertise for academia [3].
However, as observed by Bosch [4], building scalable and eﬀective research col-
laborations between industry and academia in SE is known to be challenging.
Chimalakonda [5] summarizes some of the challenges that both sides of such col-
laborative projects face, observing that most practitioners’ have perception that
researchers work on dated or futuristic theoretical challenges which are divorced
from industrial practice, while researchers believe that practitioners are looking
for quick ﬁxes instead of using systematic methods. Similarly, it is observed
that researchers are more interested in proposing new techniques and tools, fo-
cusing on technical novelty, while practitioners would appreciate solutions that
work in their context, regardless of novelty. Runeson [6] speciﬁcally analyzes
the time horizon aspects of long term industry-academia projects, which are
generally shorter in industry compared to the academic perspective, creating
risks for friction and frustration on both sides of the collaboration. Discussing
key challenges of industry-academia collaboration, Barroca [7] points out that
timeliness is very important for industry and less important for academia. She
further stresses that research outputs need to be crafted in diﬀerent ways to be
relevant to diﬀerent stakeholders, that researchers focus on rigour while industry
focuses on pragmatic approaches, and that academics tend to report research

ﬁndings in formats not easily accessible to practitioners.
more examples of gaps between research and practice, collected from a survey,
concluding that there is a wide gap between the problems that practitioners
face and the research topics discussed at academic conferences.

In an attempt to reduce such a state of practice, there have been numerous
eﬀorts to understand the collaboration challenges and ways to make collabo-
ration projects more successful. For example, the IMPACT project of ACM
SIGSOFT tried to measure the impact of SE research on practice over 6 years
[9][10], pointing out that the transfer of ideas from academia to industry is
challenging and can take roughly 15 to 20 years. At ICSE 2011, the partici-
pants of the panel ”What industry wants from research” [11] acknowledged the
industry-academia collaboration gap in SE and tried to identify key challenges
of bringing theory and practice closer together. Some of the panelists suggested
that to reduce the gap between industry and academia in SE, industry should
communicate their real problems and should share their case studies, while re-
searchers should improve usability of the tools and methods developed, and

2

consider how to improve value, especially earning. In his ICSE 2012 keynote,
Briand [12] called attention to the need for inductive research, which starts from
speciﬁc observations in real settings, as well as more thorough understanding
of practice, along with closer interactions with practitioners in the deﬁnition of
research problems. This idea has been further emphasized in [13] by advocating
the case for context-driven research. According to Briand, instead of devising
univeral solutions that generalize to any context, context-driven research strives
for practicality and scalability satisfying the constraints in the given context.
In spite of all these eﬀorts, 20 years later, there still exist signiﬁcant challenges
for SE researchers and practitioners standing in the way of establishing and
successfully running collaborative projects [14] [8] [15] [16]. At the same time,
we observe the need to establish more successful collaborations in SE [17] [18].
In this paper, we focus on industry-academia collaboration challenges per-
taining to research knowledge co-creation, where industry and academia collab-
oratively work on problem deﬁnition and solving, with continuous dialog and
goal alignment to create artifacts of value for both sides.

Research Approach. The paper addresses the research question What el-
ements are needed for an industry-academia collaboration to support research
knowledge co-creation in SE? To answer this question, we used the qualitative
research method of participant observation for data collection. The data was
collected continuously in a longitudinal study spanning 8 years of the Certus
Center existence. The data consists of ﬁeld notes taken during day-to-day dis-
cussions among the project participants, as well workshops and focus group
meetings dedicated to discussing the Certus collaboration setup. The data also
includes several hundred emails exchanged between the project participants dis-
cussing the collaboration. The data was analyzed to derive ﬁndings on the col-
laboration which were validated by the project participants using the member
checking method. The ﬁndings were used to build the Certus model which was
iteratively reﬁned throughout the collaboration as more observation data and
participants’ feedback became available.

Contributions. First, this paper contributes to the body of evidence on
bridging the industry-academia collaboration gap. Second, it presents a practi-
cal ”good practice” model aimed at improving research collaborations between
industry and academia based on research knowledge co-creation. We argue that
the co-creation thinking has the potential to prevent the drop of interest and
commitment between collaborating partners, by enforcing continuous commit-
ment and goal alignment, resulting in more eﬀective value creation based on
collective creativity. Third, the model introduces seven elements of industry-
academia collaboration in SE. At its core, each element assumes continuous
interaction, commitment and alignment between industry and academia, thus
supporting research knowledge co-creation.

2. Background

In existing work on industry-academia collaboration, there are: (i) reviews
and surveys on challenges and best practices for industry-academia collabora-

3

tion, (ii) case studies reporting success factors and lessons learned on the subject
of industry-academia collaboration, and (iii) existing collaboration models, some
of which inspired our work.

2.1. Challenges and Best Practices for Collaboration

Garousi [19] [20] reviews a number of projects describing industry-academia
collaboration in SE and synthesizes a list of patterns, anti-patterns, and chal-
lenges in collaboration. The challenges are categorized according to the themes
including the lack of research relevance, lack of training, experience and skills,
lack of interest and commitment, mismatch between industry and academia
in terms of terminology and communication, human and organizational factors
contributig to resistance to change, management related issues, contractual and
privacy concerns in connection with trust and respect. The study further iden-
tiﬁes the set of best practices addressing each of these challenges. Pertuze [21]
surveys more than 100 projects at multinational companies that engage in re-
search collaborations with academia, reporting seven guidelines for companies
to increase collaboration success. The guidelines include deﬁning the project’s
strategic context as part of the selection process, selecting boundary-spanning
project managers, sharing with the university research team the vision of how
the collaboration can help the company, investing in long-term relationships,
establishing strong communication linkage with the university team, building
broad awareness of the project within the company, and supporting the work
internally both during the contract and after, until the research can be exploited.

2.2. Collaboration Case Studies

Wohlin [22] analyzes success factors for two industry-academia collabora-
tion projects in SE in Sweden and Australia, concluding that the industrial side
of collaboration is the key element for successful collaboration. He also dis-
cusses top ten challenges for industry-academia collaborations, some of which
include trust and respect, roles and goals, and knowledge exchange instead of
technology transfer.
In addition, he proposes ﬁve levels of closeness between
industry and academia [23], ranging from less to more close: not in touch,
hearsay, sales pitch, oﬄine, and one team. Petersen [24] describes experience
from two case studies of industry-academia collaboration based on action re-
search principles. In these studies, close collaboration and co-production with
industry is the key to make reﬁnements and build solid understanding of the
context. Sandberg [25] summarizes lessons learned in a long term industry-
academia collaboration project, describing success factors enabling research ac-
tivities and results, including management engagement, network access, collab-
orator match, continuity, communication ability, need orientation, industry goal
alignment, deployment impact, industry beneﬁts, and innovativeness. Sjoo [26]
applies a systematic literature review to identify enabling factors for collab-
orative innovation between industry and academia according to timeframe for
collaboration. In the short term, such enabling factors include resources, organi-
zational capacities and Intellectual Propetry Rights (IPR), boundary-spanning

4

functions such as related ongoing activities. In the medium term, the factors
include collaborative experience, and in the long-term, culture, status of actors
and environmental factors. Dittrich [27] reports on the experience of applying
Cooperative Method Development (CMD) approach to research projects con-
ducted in collaboration with industry. CMD consists of ﬁve guidelines, the ﬁrst
of which, action research, makes an overlap with our work. Action research,
as described in the paper, consists of three phases: understanding, deliberat-
ing change, and implementation and evaluation of improvement. Barroca [7]
presents lessons learned from applying a dedicated research collaboration model
consisting of three phases: collaboration kick-oﬀ, investigation, implementation
and evaluation, to three agile project with industry. Lessons learned from these
projects are that building trust is important and can be achieved by giving feed-
back early and frequently, written agreements are useful for a running project
smoothly, ﬂexibility is important to accommodate changes, there should be out-
puts tailored to diﬀerent audiences, cash investment from industry helps show
commitment, relevant research expertise is necessary, regular contacts with in-
dustry help prevent drop out, and too much choice and information can be
overwhelming. Mathiassen [28] reports experiences from a three-year industry-
academia collaboration reﬂecting on research goals, approaches, and results. He
emphasizes the importance of a combined approach based on action research,
experiments and conventional practice to strike a useful balance between rele-
vance and rigor in practice research.

2.3. Existing Collaboration Models

There exists literature on theoretical aspects of industry-academia collabora-
tion [29] [30] [31]. However, this is theoretical work originating from economics
and research policy ﬁelds, and not the SE ﬁeld. Several authors propose mod-
els for structuring industry-academia collaborations in SE. Sjoo [26] presents a
logical model that considers a number of hypothesis about the collaboration,
and as such, the model also belongs to the body of theoretical work. In the SE
ﬁeld, Runeson [32] presents the 4+1 model of industry-academia collaboration
taking ﬁve views on the collaboration process: time, space, activity, domain,
and scenario binding the other four views. However, this is an architectural
model, describing relationships between diﬀerent components in the collabora-
tion, not considering process aspects. Garousi proposes a process model for
industry-academia collaboration, in a form of a context diagram [33]. This
model focuses on the process aspect of collaboration and on cause-eﬀect re-
lationship in collaboration, consisting of inception, planning, operational, and
transition phases. However, this is a theoretical model not describing the use of
the model in context. Unlike these models, the model presented in this paper
is a practical collaboration model, derived from our eight-year experience of
running a collaborative research project with the SE industry. The work that
is closest to ours is the model for technology transfer introduced by Gorschek
[34]. This model, which inspired our work, is inspired by the Pﬂeeger’s model
of technology transfer [35]. The Gorschek’s model proposes a seven-step collab-
oration process, with a high-level view on each step. The seven steps include:

5

basing research agenda on industry needs, problem formulation, candidate so-
lution formulation, lab validation, static validation, dynamic validation, and
solution release. We considered this model when thinking about how to facili-
tate industry-academia collaboration in our context. While we found the model
very useful we also realized that we need a more detailed collaboration frame-
work, which encompasses the full set of diﬀerent dimensions of the collaboration
process. This was especially true with respect to the roles and responsibilities
of diﬀerent participants, team composition, building and keeping a dialog be-
tween researchers and practitioners, promoting commitment and participative
knowledge generation, expectation management, as well as considerations for
commercialization of research results, which are some of the diﬀering aspects of
the model presented in this paper compared to the Gorschek’s model. Thus, the
gap in knowledge this research intends to ﬁll is to empirically describe detailed
stages of participative knowledge generation between industry and academia,
including roles of participants, principles of interaction and means of building
and sustaining continuous commitment and alignment.

2.3.1. Comparison with Other Research&Innovation Centers

Furthermore, we have analyzed two Research&Innovation centers whose
industry-academia collaboration models inﬂuenced our work, to pinpoint some
similarities and diﬀerences in their models compared to ours. They are SnT Cen-
ter in Luxembourg and CRIM Center in Montreal. SnT 1 is an Interdisciplinary
Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust. SnT conducts internationally com-
petitive research in ICT, aimed at creating socio-economic impact. In addition
to long-term, high-risk research, SnT engages in demand driven collaborative
projects with industry and the public sector, through its Partnership Program.
In that sense, SnT is very similar to Certus. Furthermore, V&V Lab for Soft-
ware Veriﬁcation and Validation (V&V) at SnT, which was lead by Prof Lionel
Briand, has a very similar thematic area to Certus. Therefore, we found it rele-
vant to draw a line between the V&V lab at SnT and Certus. The data for the
comparative analysis between Certus and the V&V lab at SnT is derived from
numerous discussions held with Lionel Briand, who was brieﬂy a Certus member
at the beginning. There are two particular concepts that Certus adopted and
that can be atributed to Lionel Briand. The ﬁrst is the concept of a context-
driven research [13], which means that in order to create impact for industry,
research needs to focus on problems deﬁned in collaboration with industrial
partners. Through experimentation, Certus has realized the importance of it
and has adopted context-driven research as one of pillars of its collaboration
model. Another concept and further similarity between the two labs is the no-
tion of an industry champion. Having active industry champions in some of the
Certus projects proved an important element of a successful industry-academia
collaboration.

CRIM 2 is an applied research and expertise center in ICT. It aims to con-
tribute to scientiﬁc advancement and to help organizations be more competitive
through the development of innovative technology and the transfer of know-how.
CRIM has one of the largest networks of IT companies in Quebec, which makes
a rich innovation ecosystem with diﬀerent actors and resources needed for the
center to achieve its mission. After visiting CRIM and discussing with its mem-
bers, it became clear that such an ecosystem with high innovation and absorptive
capacity is a crucial factor facilitating a collaboration with industry. Certus on
the other hand, operated in a less-rich innovation ecosystem compared to that
of CRIM, which made performing research-based innovation more challenging.
The companies we collaborated with did not have such high levels of absorp-
tive capacity, which is the ability to appropriate research- and innovation-based
results. Motivated by CRIM, we realized that in order to foster the scientiﬁc
and innovation excellence of the center, we must build a dedicated collaboration
model which will facilitate knowledge creation with and exploitation by indus-
try, resulting in improved absorptive capacity for our industry partners, which
in turn will create richer innovation ecosystem for Certus to operate in.

There are many other successful Research&Innovation centers in SE in the
world, for example the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineer-
ing in Maryland, known for applied research and the CREST Center for Re-
search on Evolution, Search and Testing at the University College London UK,
to name a few. However, there is no publicly available information on the de-
tails of their collaboration models with industry, to make it possible for us to
compare.

3. Case Study Context

This section describes the context of the industry-academia collaboration,

which was the basis for developing the Certus collaboration model.

Certus is a Norwegian eight-year research-based innovation center that started
in 2011 and concluded in 2019. It engaged a SE research group at Simula Re-
search Laboratory (SRL) 3, acting as a host institution, ﬁve large for-proﬁt
companies: Cisco Systems Norway (CIS), ABB Robotics (ABB), FMC Tech-
nologies (FMC), Kongsberg Maritime (KM), Esito (ESI) and two public sector
institutions: the Norwegian Customs and Toll (TOL) and the Cancer Registry
of Norway (CRN). For the sake of simplicity, we refer to both the collaboration
between Simula and industrial companies and between Simula and public sector
institutions as industry-academia collaboration. Similarly, we jointly refer to all
Certus partners as industry partners. Simula is a publicly-funded Norwegian
research institution whose mission is to create knowledge about fundamental
scientiﬁc challenges that are of genuine value for the industry and society. An

overview of the Certus partners and Simula, along with their domains, moti-
vation for the collaboration, dates of participation in Certus and main outputs
produced is presented in Table 1.

Certus has conducted research in the ﬁeld of software testing, veriﬁcation
and validation, targeting the following types of systems: (i) real-time embed-
ded software systems, (ii) highly-conﬁgurable software systems, and (iii) data-
intensive software systems. The mandate of the Certus Center was to conduct
industry-relevant research, where researchers and practitioners work collabo-
ratively to deﬁne problems of mutual interest to address and create value for
both sides. The Certus collaboration excluded consultancy activities, which are
characterized by lesser degree of freedom to deﬁne problems to work on.

The Certus Center was funded by the Norwegian Research Council, the host
institution, and the industry partners (in-kind), for eight years, with around 21
million NOK per year. The research institution partner has committed six senior
researchers, six PhD students, and one research engineer to the project. All
original Certus projects ended in 2019, due to the ending of funding. However,
some of the partners continued the collaboration through new projects. ABB
and SRL continued collaboration in a new project that is adjacent to the project
of testing robot control software, addressed in Certus. CRN and SRL continued
to work together in a new project that is related to testing of the cancer registry
system, which was addressed in Certus.

3.1. Project Setup

The Certus Center was structured into 6 scientiﬁc projects, each dealing with
a speciﬁc thematic area of a broader ﬁeld of software V&V, and 4 governing
projects, dealing with overall project management, research exploitation and
dissemination. An overview of the Certus projects is presented in Table 2.

Scientiﬁc projects addressing V&V challenges common to several partners
crosscut multiple partner domains where there is interest.
In this way, we
achieved the increase of interaction and communication between the partners,
relating to concrete challenges and their technical solutions, which allowed for
common areas of interest to arise and create synergies.

Among the governing projects, the Management project involved the ac-
tivities such as projects’ ﬁnancial governance, reporting to the funding body,
deﬁnition of the Certus annual work plan (describing planned activities for all
projects), making strategic decisions of involving new partners, allocating re-
sources to projects, liaising between the partners in case of conﬂicts, monitor-
ing the projects’ progress, making decisions to initiate market research activi-
ties for promising technologies produced in Certus, and running administrative
governance (collecting deliverables, minutes from meetings, reports from mid-
way evaluations). The Research Exploitation project dealt with collecting and
analysing the data for the Certus collaboration model development, the develop-
ment and updating of the model. The Training project was providing courses to
train industry professional with the state of the art in software V&V. The Dis-
semination and Communication project was making ongoing eﬀorts throughout

Governance. The Certus Center was governed by a board and led by a center
director. The board consisted of representatives of the industry partners and the
host institution. The Board was meeting bi-annually, discussing the progress of
the Certus projects and any matters related to Certus operations.

Project Outputs. Certus has developed research outputs in the form of scien-
tiﬁc publications (journal and conference papers and technical reports), method-
ology and process guidelines, software prototype tools, and educational material.
Examples of diﬀerent project outputs are shown in Table 1.

Most of the research results achieved in the project had the potential to
be developed into industry-relevant results, in the form of software tools or
research expertise captured in methodology documents. However, the process
of developing such practically relevant results has showed to be challenging
without a systematic approach to collaboration.

3.2. Need for Collaboration Model

Soon after start-up, we realized that we needed a dedicated collaboration
model that will (i) foster research knowledge co-creation through joint problem
deﬁnition and solving, (ii) promote continuous dialog to help align the expec-
tations of researchers and practitioners, (iii) ensure that the research output
created in the project is transformed into results with practical relevance and
beneﬁt for the partners, and (iv) ensure that such results are eﬀectively trans-
ferred to and exploited by the partners. In addition to creating industrial impact
for the project partners, we were also interested in analyzing exploitation op-
portunities and creating greater impact beyond the project partners for those
results that are general and applicable to other target domains. Creating a col-
laboration model supporting these mentioned objectives was the main aim of
the governing project Research Exploitation.

10

4. Model Development Method

The Certus collaboration model was developed throughout the project life-
time, incrementally and collaboratively with all project partners. We aimed to
allow all project members to shape the collaboration principles. To this end,
we used the Participatory Action Research [36], which is a knowledge develop-
ment methodology involving action and reﬂection. The goal was to provide for
everyone to participate in data gathering and analysis. Both data collection
and model development was performed in the Research Exploitation governing
project, shown in Table 2. The initial version of the model was developed soon
after the project start, and then improved in later years.

4.1. Data Collection and Analysis

We used qualitative case study method to collect data for the model de-
velopment, which included participant observation, reﬂections, workshops and
focus group discussions. The main method used was participant observation
[37] [38] [39]. This is a method in which data is collected systematically and
unobtrusively through social interaction between an observant and informants.
The ﬁrst author of this paper participated both as an observer and active re-
searcher in the collaboration during all 8 years. She was part of one Joint Team
in one of the scientiﬁc projects, which enabled her to collect various data during
the knowledge co-creation process that might not be noticed otherwise. She was
also involved in the Research Exploitation project which allowed her to collect
insights on the process of the model development and improvement based on
the partners’ feedback and data collected in observations.

The data for the model development was collected frequently and in a con-
tinuous manner, in a number of occasions. Notes from the meetings and infor-
mal discussions among the project participants were taken daily. These notes
include information such as motivations for collaboration described by partic-
ipants, choices of speciﬁc methods and technologies for the solution develop-
ment, the terminology used, choices of evaluation metrics, the types of topics
discussed, status updates, and behaviors and interaction patterns between the
participants. At the beginning of the project, several workshops and meetings
were held with all the partners, dedicated to the question of how the organize
eﬀective collaboration between the partners in Certus, during which the obser-
vant was taking notes. In addition to the notes from these events, the observer
used about 500 emails exchanged between her and other Certus members on
the subject of the collaboration, spanning over 8 years.

During data collection, the observer tried to make taking notes as unob-
trusive as possible, so that those being observed are not thinking about being
observed. This included taking notes electronically, instead of using pen and
paper, which appeared natural as everyone in the meeting was usually using a
laptop. Immediately after each meeting with note taking, the observer reﬂected
on the information observed and augmented the notes with additional details.
The collected data was analyzed as soon as it was collected. In some cases,
the collected data was used to build up the evidence in support of the existing

11

hypotheses about the collaboration, i.e. validating the existing version of the
model. In other cases, new hypotheses were deﬁned grounded in the data, for
example for extending the model with new aspects. For the latter, we used the-
matic analysis method [40] to identify and interpret themes within data. Specif-
ically, the data was ﬁrst thoroughly read to identify meaningful features in the
data, called codes. Some examples of codes include ”goal alignment”, ”problem
deﬁnition”, ”understanding motivation for research”, ”understanding technical
requirements”, ”early interaction between practitioners and researchers”. Cod-
ing was done iteratively by combining and splitting codes, and adding new codes.
Then we looked for relationships between the codes such as diﬀerences and sim-
ilarities, and grouped the codes to form themes in the data. Next, the themes
were reviewed and reﬁned, to make sure they are coherent and accurately rep-
resent the data. The theme formed related to the example codes is ”Beneﬁts of
intensive interaction between industry and academia at early stage.”

4.2. Model Development

The Certus collaboration model was developed in an iterative manner. First,
a Working Group was formed consisting of one representative of each project
partner. Based on the initial assumptions about the collaboration and the previ-
ous experience in industry-academia collaborative projects, the Working Group
proposed an initial collaboration model. The initial model was extensively dis-
cussed in focus group meetings with each partner individually. These meetings
were organised between the representative of Simula, the observer, and relevant
staﬀ of a single partner, including engineers and managers. The reason for hold-
ing individual meetings with the partners was conﬁdentiality, to allow partners
a full freedom to speak, which due to potential conﬂicts of interest, might not
have been achieved if partners had been together in the meeting. The provided
feedback was used for the model improvement, to better reﬂect the common
view and expectations from the collaboration. As the scientiﬁc projects started
activities on problem deﬁnition and solution development, additional feedback
was provided that served to correct ﬂaws and incorrect assumptions, and to pro-
pose a more mature model. The feedback was provided in two ways, by means
of: (i) member checking [41], where the collaboration model was presented to
the informants at diﬀerent stages of development, to elicit their validation and
comments, and (ii) observation, through ﬁeld notes and reﬂection of the ob-
server. The feedback was being provided in the same manner throughout the
project lifetime, which fed into the model reﬁnement. The illustration of the
Certus model development is shown in Figure 1.

5. Certus Collaboration Model

In this section, we ﬁrst present the collaboration setup, followed by the

description of the model phases.

12

Figure 1: Development process of the Certus Collaboration Model.

5.1. Principles of Collaboration

Key ideas underpinning the Certus model include research knowledge co-
creation and continuous dialog and goal alignment between the project
participants. In the process of research knowledge co-creation, researchers and
industry practitioners actively participate in collaboration, by jointly identify-
ing practical (industrial) problems to be solved, translating them into research
problems, co-creating solutions and evaluating their potential to solve the prac-
tical problems, and reporting the results through research papers. Through
experimentation, we realized that co-creation creates the culture of shared own-
ership, and helps conduct research in a way that makes its results more easily
exploitable.

Throughout the collaboration, it is important to enable continuous dialog
and goal alignment between researchers and industry practitioners, to keep the
problem deﬁnition valid, to revisit and revise the partner’s expectations, to
ensure that the solution being developed meets the technical and non-technical
requirements. Dialog helps keep the focus on problem solving and ensures good
progress of the work. In addition to enabling active dialog between the members
of a single scientiﬁc project, we promoted the dialog between the members of
diﬀerent Certus scientiﬁc projects, to communicate the progress and results
developed among individual projects, which helped identify and build synergies
across the Certus Center.

5.2. Teams and Roles in Collaboration

Scientiﬁc activities of the Certus Center took place in 6 projects. There
is one Joint Team formed per project, consisting of 1-2 researchers (includ-
ing PhD students) and 0-1 research engineers from Simula, and 1-3 industrial

are typically playing the role of champions. This is illustrated in Figure 2. In
principle, Joint Teams are distinct per projects, however, in some cases there
is an overlap. This happens when some of the scientiﬁc challenges addressed in
one project are of interest also for another project. In that case, it is natural
to share resources (knowledge, methods, staﬀ) among projects. The staﬃng of
Joint Teams happens after the industrial problems to be solved are deﬁned, such
that the right composition of competences can be found. Joint Teams not nec-
essarily need to be fully staﬀed from beginning, new people can be added/freed
when needed. For example, a research engineer’s competence is typically re-
quired slightly later in the project, after solution concepts have been developed.
At a later stage of technology development, a Lead Team is formed, consist-
ing of the partner’s engineers and industry champions whose role is to support
the technology transfer to the partner’s organization, the exploitation of the
technology beneﬁts and its wider adoption in the organization. The Lead Team
sometimes needs the support of the Joint Team, for example for technology
adaptation (see Section 5.7).

Day-to-day Operation. The research side of the Joint Team works on com-
pany sites at times where there is a need for a high level of interaction between
the Joint Team members. This happens during the process of industry practice
analysis and industry problem deﬁnition (see Section 5.4), technology pilot-
testing (See Section 5.6), and especially during technology integration with the
existing frameworks at the partner’s organization, as well as training for technol-
ogy use (see Section 5.7). At times when researchers perform the state-of-the-art
analysis, or devise conceptual solutions, they work in the lab, which provides a
more suitable environment for such activities.

5.3. Model Phases

The Certus collaboration model consists of seven phases: (1) Problem Scop-
ing, (2) Knowledge Conception, (3) K&T Development, (4) K&T Transfer,
(5) K&T Exploitation, (6) Organisational Adoption, and (7) Market Research,
graphically presented in Figure 3.

The Certus model is agile, where outputs of speciﬁc phases constantly aﬀect
and alter subsequent phases through feedback loops. As a simple example, af-
ter a software tool has been introduced in a partner’s context and the partner
perceives the need for added functionality in the tool transfer phase, this infor-
mation is fed back into the tool development phase to implement the change,
and possibly further to the knowledge conception phase to reﬁne the underlying
concepts.

Next we describe each of the model phases.

5.4. Problem Scoping

The starting point is a practical or industrial problem. The industrial
problems we faced in Certus were technical problems arising from underper-
forming processes in industrial systems. For example, high cost of software

In-
dustrial problem deﬁnition is accompanied by an industrial objective, for exam-
ple, to reduce the cost (meaning time in this context) of regression
testing by 20%.

To identify an industrial problem suitable for addressing collaboratively by
researchers and practitioners, there are intensive interactions between the two.
Practitioners are describing and demonstrating current practices and their lim-
itations. Researchers are working to understand as much of the domain and
business setting as possible, for example, which processes are underperforming,
e.g. of low quality or too costly, which tasks and challenges and interrelated,
what constraints need to be satisﬁed.

Sometimes the deﬁned problem is simpler and can be solved in the short
term, and sometimes the problem is complex and needs to be decomposed into
smaller sub-problems and tasks which can be prioritized according to urgency,
feasibility and risks.

An industrial problem is further restated as a research problem, described

in Section 5.5.

An important element in the initial communication during the problem scop-
ing that has to be understood are expectations for the outcome of the collab-
oration; what solutions is the partner looking for, what are the technical re-
quirements for the form of the solution sought (e.g., a software tool/service,
methodological guidelines), what beneﬁts is the partner expecting and how can
those beneﬁts be measured. For example, fewer software ﬁeld failures that could
indicate improved software quality, less time spent in testing or shorter time to
market that would indicate improved productivity, or new market opportunities.
It is especially important to understand what beneﬁt is expected and how it can
be measured, because later in the knowledge development stage, the solution is
assessed against these metrics.

After an industrial problem worth pursuing has been deﬁned, a Joint Team

is formed to address it.

5.5. Knowledge Conception

After an industrial problem has been deﬁned, it is further restated as a re-
search problem. A research problem is a statement of a real (industrial) prob-
lem that can be solved using research knowledge. Such knowledge can be exist-
ing or novel knowledge needs to be generated in the process of problem solving.
For our example of the industrial problem given before, a research problem can
be stated as the one of developing test reduction techniques able to
decrease the number of regression tests, such that regression test
execution runs 20% faster, while not decreasing fault detection
effectiveness of regression tests.

During knowledge conception, a Joint Team is maturing ideas and creating
concepts for the problem solution. There are two inputs to this process, as
illustrated in Figure 2. One is the analysis of the industry practice, performed
in the previous Problem Scoping phase. Another input is the state-of-the-art

17

(SoA) analysis. SoA includes the research solutions, if any, which have been
proposed for the same or similar problem, and whether they were applied in
practice and how they performed. SoA also includes the analysis of commercial
solutions that could solve the problem at hand, and what are the constraints
for applying those solutions to the problem. In our experience, it was hardly
possible to ﬁnd an existing commercial solution that can satisfy the constraints
of the problem at hand, because the industry domains of our partners were
highly specialized and the desired solutions had to be seamlessly integrated with
other tools and services. In one case only, we were able to use the existing tool for
software variability management, pure::variants 4, as part of the ﬁnal solution
developed, by extending it with a novel research component for automated test
selection and reduction.

If no existing solution can be used to adequately address the problem at
hand, research activities are started to create novel knowledge/technology build-
ing on knowledge gained during the steps of industry practice analysis and SoA
analysis. Resulting novel research concepts are analysed by the Joint Team to
identify the constraints of the proposed concept solution, to assess its ﬁtness
for the problem, and whether it is aligned with the partner’s expectations. A
decision is made by the Joint Team on whether the conceptual solution has the
potential to solve the problem and is worth investing further eﬀort. Knowledge
produced in this stage is highly provisional and conceptual, e.g. in the form of
presentations, algorithms, etc.

5.6. Knowledge and Technology Development

During this phase, ﬁrst a prototype tool is developed, or a methodological
document is speciﬁed following the conceptual solution, then pilot-tested in real
setting and matured. Therefore, this phase contains the following two stages.

Knowledge and Technology Development. The knowledge underlying the
solution concepts is elaborated and reiﬁed. If the solution is a particular technol-
ogy, the knowledge is coded in methods or algorithms, and possibly, developed
in the form of a software prototype tool.
If the solution comprises practice
guidelines, the knowledge is speciﬁed through procedures and expressed in the
form of methodological documents. Once the K&T has been developed (both a
software prototype tool and a methodological document), it is assessed for its
potential to solve the industrial problem. The assessment is performed by the
Joint Team, with experiments using real ﬁeld data The result of the assessment
help decide if the prototype technology should be allocated engineering resources
for further technical development and piloting, in which case the Joint Team
may be expanded with adequate resources, for example research engineers.

issues and to develop a software tool that is more scalable to the size and com-
plexity of the target domain. A Development Plan is made to manage the
development work in this and the coming Phases, i.e. deﬁne activities and re-
sponsibilities and allocate resources with a detailed timeline for the expected
results, to ensure timely progress of the work. An example of a Development
Plan we used in one of the projects contained the following elements: (i) descrip-
tion of the K&T: its functionality, purpose, areas of application, (ii) partners
involved in the development eﬀort (members of the Joint Team and the Lead
Team), their roles and responsibilities, (iii) desired main results: software tools,
products, processes, services, patents, (iv) detailed activities required to pro-
duce the desired results, (v) detailed timeline with milestones for producing
the desired results, (vi) resources committed, (vii) intellectual property rights
(IPR) aspects, (viii) market analysis for the K&T to identify technical and
market considerations or limitations that can inﬂuence technology commercial-
ization, in case the K&T progresses to commercialization. These elements are
added to the Development Plan as they become relevant, i.e. as the K&T moves
through diﬀerent Phases. A Development Plan is continuously updated as the
expectations, goals and motivations of the stakeholders change.

During the K&T veriﬁcation, the newly-developed K&T is tested in a pilot
project, to demonstrate its eﬀectiveness (i.e., problem-solving capabilities for
a smaller-size problem) and to assess its potential to succeed in a full-scale
project. The assessment is performed by the Joint Team using real datasets
and measuring against the metrics achieved by current industry practice. The
result of the assessment helps determine if the developed K&T has the potential
for successful exploitation in the partner’s organization and is thus a candidate
for the K&T transfer.

Furthermore, the results of the K&T veriﬁcation help prove or disprove the
hypothesis underlying the research problems deﬁned in Phase 2. This creates
the opportunity for publishing novel research results as technical contributions
(algorithms, tools), or empirical research (case studies, experience reports). Of-
ten, as it was the case in our projects, researchers and practitioners jointly
co-author papers. A good practice is to consider knowledge protection needs
before knowledge publishing. Such considerations are made by the Joint Team,
sometimes involving higher management, to decide whether industry partners
have any interests in protecting the knowledge before publishing.

5.7. Knowledge and Technology Transfer

The goal of this phase is to put the partner in full possession of the veri-
ﬁed K&T and to create the conditions such that the K&T can be applied and
maintained. In practical terms, this means that the partner can independently
use the K&T as part of the existing tools and processes and is able to spread
it further within the organization. In this phase a Lead Team is formed. We
distinguish two following stages in this process.

Technology Integration and Adaptation. This is mainly an engineering
stage, required for transferring the technology in the form of software tools

19

(i.e., it is not applicable for knowledge in the form of guideline documents).
Technology being transferred is integrated with the partner’s existing tools and
processes. Technical integration usually requires some adaptation of the tool,
e.g. interfacing with the existing tools, and this work is done jointly by the Joint
Team and the Lead Team. After the solution has been made usable, additional
eﬀort is needed to make it fully adopted by the partner and used without any
assistance from researchers.

Knowledge and Technology Introduction. Introducing new knowledge and
technology into an organization presents a set of challenges, and a key to success
is starting K&T introduction planning suﬃciently early, along with the K&T
technical integration. The goal of this stage is to prepare the partner organi-
zation for receiving the K&T and make a plan for the hand-oﬀ. First, a Lead
Team receives training to gain full ownership over the K&T. The engineers who
are part of the Joint Team already own the underlying concepts. The goal now
is to make a larger group of partner’s engineers familiar with these concepts
and able to use the K&T eﬀortlessly and independently in diﬀerent scenarios,
as well as to propagate it throughout the organization. The K&T introduction
phase includes the training for K&T use, given by researchers and supported by
reference manuals for the new technology. Besides the training for use, there is
training for technology maintenance. Maintenance can be required when new
requirements are raised, or when parts of the system interacting with the trans-
ferred technology change. For some partners, maintenance can be done in-house
and in that case engineers should be trained to support maintenance activities.
For the partners who do not have the resources to support maintenance, there
are several mechanisms that can be considered for maintaining transferred tech-
nology, discussed in Section 5.9. The K&T introduction stage only makes plans
for technology maintenance, while the training for maintenance takes place in
the K&T adoption process.

5.8. Knowledge and Technology Exploitation

After the K&T has been transferred to the partner’s organization and the
Lead Team has been able to apply it, it is sometimes possible to quantify the
economic beneﬁt gained from the research investment and, thus, calculate the
K&T exploitation impact. The partner can start exploiting the K&T before it
is widely adopted in the organization, since the adoption process is slow-paced
and happens gradually. Besides, some K&T may only make a sizeable impact
in a particular sub-unit rather than the enterprise as a whole. The exploitation
impact of a transferred and introduced K&T is correlated with the degree of
economic gain that the K&T has made for the partner. In the context of Cer-
tus, examples of such gains include reduced costs of software testing, increased
revenue due to better product quality and more sales, or new business oppor-
tunities. The economic impact of a new K&T can be achieved either in the
short or the long term. Some types of K&T have short lead time in demon-
strating their impact and bringing economic gain, such as, for example, new
software tools. Other K&T enhance the partners’ ability to innovate through

20

increased knowledge and understanding of speciﬁc research topics, thus creat-
ing an incremental impact by improving organizational innovation capacity and
performance in the long run. For the Certus projects, it was sometimes possible
to approximate the K&T exploitation impact using two metrics that measure
both a short-term and long-term economic impact. However, we acknowledge
the challenge of measuring the exact impact of a newly introduced technology,
because such technology does not operate in a vacuum, but instead there are fac-
tors coming from surrounding technologies or processes that evolve and improve
themselves, and that can fully or partly aﬀect the new technology operation.
The two metrics we used in Certus projects include:

– RoI, calculated as (gain from investment - cost of investment)/

cost of investment, as a quantitative metric. Gain from investment is
the ﬁnancial gain obtained by using a novel K&T technology, for exam-
ple, reducing the cost of regression testing by 20% (our previous example).
Cost of investment can include the cost of transferring the K&T into the
partner’s organization (engineering eﬀort of integrating and adapting the
solution), training costs (eﬀort of learning new skills), operating costs (ef-
fort of using K&T), maintenance costs, costs of licenses as part of the
K&T. However, accurately calculating the beneﬁt of investment is consid-
ered much harder then calculating the cost of investment [42].

– Partner’s perception of the beneﬁt obtained in terms of strengthened in-
novation capacity, as a qualitative metric collected through interviews and
questionnaires.

5.9. Organisational Adoption

K&T organizational adoption is a process where a Lead Team as the owner
of the K&T spreads the technology throughout the organisation into routine
use. A Joint Team assists the Lead Team, if necessary, and provides training
for the technology maintenance. There could be several maintenance mecha-
nism, depending on the partner’s motivation, skills and available resources, as
follows: (i) the partner allocates resources to maintain the technology in-house,
(ii) if there is a tool vendor partner among the project partners, this partner
analyses their motivation and competence to provide maintenance services for
the technology and to explore possible commercialization opportunities. In that
case researchers help the tool vendor partner understand the technology. IPR
also needs to be investigated, (iii) the technology maintenance is outsourced
IPR needs to be investigated as well, (iv) the technology
to a third party.
maintenance is handled through a contract research service by the host research
institute.

K&T adoption process is known to be diﬃcult and slow [43], taking even
10 up to 15 years [35] and therefore needs to be supported by comprehensive
plans, as it requires altering or even discarding old practices and employing and
sustaining new ones. One important factor that inﬂuences the adoption process
is the organizational absorptive capacity [44], as the ability of the partner to

21

acquire and assimilate new research-based K&T. Absorptive capacity has been
considered as an important contributor to the success of technology transfer in
academic engagements [45]. Organizations with stronger absorptive capacity
will more readily recognize the value and accept a new K&T. Since the level of
absorptive capacity partly depends on prior knowledge and experience, as well
as innovation capacity, the development of innovation capacity of the Certus
partners is considered an important outcome of the Certus Center. Further-
more, an important factor that negatively inﬂuences the adoption process is
discontinuity of the partner’s business focus and priorities, where the organi-
zational strategy becomes no longer aligned with the investment in the area
concerned with the K&T that is a candidate for adoption. The same applies to
cases where K&T champions leave the partner’s organization. In that case, in
our experience, the co-creation process typically slows down and the dialog be-
comes more sparse. Another factors that aﬀect the adoption process include the
organization’s ﬁnancial resilience and maintenance of the innovation capacity.

5.10. Market Research

Some of the research results produced in a collaborative project between
industry and academia may have the potential for achieving greater beneﬁts
outside the context of the collaborative project. These could be, for example,
general-purpose technology that has a broad spectrum of applications, and for
which the industry partners do not have interest to pursue commercialization
themselves. In such cases, if a host research institute has the resources, they
can investigate the market potential for these value propositions, and exam-
ine the most appropriate channels for their commercialization. The motivation
of the research institute for doing such type of activities includes potentially
increased ﬁnancial portfolio, as well as improved visibility and innovation rep-
utation, in case that the technology proves the market potential and that its
commercialization is successful.

Factors to be considered in an initial market research include: (i) the exis-
tence of similar and competing technologies, (ii) novelty and added value com-
pared to these technologies, (iii) customer interest in the value proposition and
the level of their interest, e.g. willingness to invest in further development, adap-
tation and transfer, (iv) limitations that can inﬂuence commercialization, e.g.
weaknesses of the value proposition, (v) commercialization channels, e.g. spin-
oﬀs for product development or consultancy services, or technology licensing,
or technology selling, (vi) resources and partners needed for commercialization,
and (vii) comprehensive IPR investigation.
If the initial analysis shows the
market potential for the value proposition, a more systematic analysis should
be performed. This may include the development of a business model, to test
the feasibility of the business idea for the value proposition. The business model
helps identify target customers for the technology, examine the infrastructure
needed for developing a commercial product from the technology, and analyze
cost and revenue structures. If a detailed analysis shows potential for the tech-
nology commercialization, actual commercialization, as well as IP protection (if
needed), needs to be pursued by other means than the collaboration project.

22

Such means may include the creation of a spin-oﬀ, or technology licensing or
selling, since technology commercialization activities exceed the scope and re-
sources of the collaboration project.

In case of a spin-oﬀ creation, in our experience, it is recommended to investi-
gate several aspects: (i) are there highly motivated and skilled people to set on
a journey of company creation. For example, it is beneﬁcial to have on-board a
researcher who had a key role in the technology creation. However, it needs to be
conﬁrmed whether s(he) has aspirations for entrepreneurship or (s)he wants to
continue a research career, (ii) what support and incentives are provided by the
research institute for a researcher leaving their research position. Some employ-
ees of early-stage companies make no salary before the company has increased
valuation.
In that case, keeping a part-time research position provides some
level of ﬁnancial security for a researcher until the spin-oﬀ company reduces
risks and increases value, (iii) plans for company ﬁnancing.

Analysing the market potential of a research-based technology usually falls
outside the job scope of a typical researcher. In the case of Certus researchers,
the host research institute established a dedicated project with suitable re-
sources for dealing with the market research and pre-commercialization activi-
ties for one of the research-based technologies developed in one of the scientiﬁc
projects.

6. Certus Model Evolution: Example with Cisco Systems

In this section we describe the life of one collaborative project guided by the
Certus collaboration model. This was a scientiﬁc project Testing of Real Time
Embedded Systems in collaboration with Cisco Systems. We give examples of
the model evolution based on the experiences made and knowledge generated
during the project execution.

At the project beginning, Cisco test engineers revealed the problem of high
test eﬀort in regression testing they are facing, coming from (semi-)manual test
selection. The software under test was highly conﬁgurable, which means that
it could be run with a large number of varying input parameters and their
combinations. This created a need for eﬀective management of test complex-
ity caused by variations in system structure and functionality. After a set of
initial discussions about the practical Cisco problem, a Joint Team was formed
consisting of 3 test engineers from Cisco, 2 research scientist and 1 PhD Stu-
dent from Simula. The Joint Team started the problem scoping by observing
the industrial practice of testing highly conﬁgurable systems, with the goal of
identifying addressable software testing challenges. This initial phase of chal-
lenge identiﬁcation took place in the form of frequent one-on-one meetings and
technical workshops, where researchers were learning domain speciﬁcs necessary
for problem formulation. Furthermore, a common terminology was built, which
was useful throughout the whole project. The industry problem was deﬁned
as the one of reducing the cost of regression testing by 20%. After analyzing
existing approaches to such similar problems, we found that eﬀective testing

23

in such an environment aimed for automated and optimized mechanisms to re-
duce manual eﬀort, and improve the testing process workﬂow. The research
problem was deﬁned as the one of developing test reduction techniques able
to reduce the number of regression tests such that regression testing runs 20%
faster. Based on these objectives, the Joint Team started with the concept so-
lution development. The K&T Development stage took the Joint Team around
two man-years to develop a candidate proof-of-concept that was experimentally
tested and improved based on the feedback from engineers. There were a lot of
iterations between the phases of Knowledge Conception and K&T Development,
for reﬁning the solution concept, based on the feedback from the solution de-
velopment and the insights from the evolving state-of-the-art. The Joint Team
tried to make demonstrable progres all the time, which helped keep all team
members enthusiastic. The solution built to address the industrial problem was
TITAN [46], a software testing tool that automates and optimizes several stages
in software testing processes, balancing the expenditure and quality of testing
[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. TITAN development was an iterative process where
the solution was validated in an operational environment, using real industrial
data and artifacts, and then improved following the feedback given in validation.
The Joint Team evaluated TITAN with respect to the time reduction metric of
20%. After successful evaluation, the project transitioned to the K&T Transfer
phase. In this phase the Lead Team was formed, who worked with the Joint
Team to integrate TITAN and adapt it to the existing testing framework. In
this phase, it became evident that modiﬁcations need to be made in the tech-
nical implementation of TITAN to enable seamless integration. TITAN was
an Eclipse plugin, while Cisco needed it to be a software service for a smooth
integration. As the Cisco test engineer said ”Unless we are able to smoothly
integrate the tool, there is not much chance our engineers will use it”. This
feedback was propagated to the K&T Development phase where changes were
made in the technical choices for the TITAN solution. This is an example of
the experience from one project being used to update the model and provide a
lesson learned for other projects. The learning is that listening to and under-
standing the technical requirements for the solution being developed is crucial
before the technical development starts, in order for the solution to be useful in
practice. At that point, the Joint Team was extended by one research engineer
from Simula, whose expertise was suitable for the type of work needed. Based
on the feedback, the Joint Team continued with the technology development and
experimentation in the K&T phase, until the technical solution was produced
that can easily integrate with the existing testing framework at Cisco, in the
K&T Transfer phase. After that, the Lead Team tried to measure the beneﬁt of
TITAN. Precise quantitative measurement was challenging, because there were
diﬀerent factors aﬀecting the overall test time in regression testing. However, in
qualitative assessment, the industrial part of the Joint Team and the Lead Team
stated that working on the project with Simula researchers improved their un-
derstanding of particular research techniques on software testing and increased
their ability to integrate research results into their practice. The Certus model
refers to this type of impact as improved innovation capacity. In the Organiza-

24

tional Adoption phase of TITAN, there was an industry champion at Cisco who
played the key role in the tool adoption. He was open-minded and passionate
about research and technology, and he was a member of the Lead Team. He
was at the middle-management level and was actively promoting the tool among
other colleagues. This resulted in TITAN being adopted within one team, who
dealt with software quality assurance. TITAN was not spread throughout the
entire organization due to the nature of that Cisco business unit. The purpose
of the tool was to improve regression testing, which was not central to the core
business units dealing with video communication technology. Further, based on
the interaction with tool vendors outside of the Certus projects, we hypothe-
sized that TITAN could be useful in other domains in need of test optimization
and therefore started to work on Market Research for the tool. After the initial
analysis proved promising, Simula obtained additional funding aimed at testing
the market potential for TITAN. A business model was developed proving the
commercial potential of the tool, and together with external resources (business
developers and advisers) we agreed that the most appropriate commercializa-
tion channel is a spin-oﬀ. One of the business advisers advised that ”It is very
important that at least one of the technology inventors joins the company. This
is because in a technology company it is critical to master the technology in
early stages before the ﬁrst sales are obtained and technology proved useful for
customers”. At that point, discussions started on clarifying the IPR and the
incentives of key researchers for joining the spin-oﬀ. However, the discussions
revealed that the key researchers involved in TITAN development did not have
aspirations for entrepreneurship. This is another example where the experience
from one project improved the Certus model. A lesson learned here is that the
motivations of key researchers for joining the spin-oﬀ should be clariﬁed early
on. However, during the Market Research phase, ideas were generated for new
projects that were later addressed together with the Certus industry partners
and other external partners, feeding into the Problem Scoping phase.

7. Discussion and Conclusion

This paper presents the Certus collaboration model, which answers the
research question of what elements are needed for an industry-academia col-
laboration to support research knowledge co-creation in SE. These elements
are problem scoping, knowledge conception, K&T development, K&T transfer,
K&T exploitation, organisational adoption, and market research.
In our ex-
perience, a collaboration model supporting research knowledge co-creation has
the potential to overcome notable collaboration challenges such as the lack of
relevance, interest, and commitment from the collaboration parties. Compared
to other industry-academia collaboration models proposed in SE, the Certus
model presents a practical collaboration framework that details diﬀerent roles
and responsibilities of project participants, ways of promoting commitment and
participative knowledge generation among project participants, as well as some
directions towards the commercialization of research results.

25

7.1. Reﬂections on Model Development

The model was developed iteratively, embodying only preliminary elements
of collaboration at beginning, and gradually evolving as the collaboration pro-
gressed and as we gained more experience of co-creation. The very initial version
of the model did not promote the concept of co-creation early enough. For ex-
ample, a Joint Team was not formed already in the Problem Scoping phase,
but more towards the K&T Development phase. This resulted in a more loose
ownership of the problem deﬁnition by industry partners, and consequently less
active participation in concept development. After the beneﬁt of forming a Joint
Team during a Problem Scoping phase became evident in one of the scientiﬁc
projects, the model was improved.

Even if all model phases posed certain challenges for the model development,
there was one part which was the most challenging. That was devising the
metrics that can be used for measuring the K&T exploitation impact. For
most of our projects, it came down to measuring the impact of a new tool that
works as part of a bigger toolchain that evolves and improves performance itself
overtime. As a quantitative metrics, we proposed to approximate RoI, which
was sometimes feasible. More feasible was to analyze an improved innovation
capacity, as a qualitative metric, through interviews and focus group discussions.

7.2. Limitations

There are several limitations and validity threats of the Certus model.
Internal Validity. The collection of data underpinning the Certus model re-
lies on the participant observation method, which has several limitations. First,
the method is subjective as it represents a perspective of an individual observer.
To mitigate this threat, triangulation of three data sources was used, which in-
cluded emails, ﬁeld notes, and feedback from the informants, both the Working
Group members and the Joint Teams on their perspective on the collaboration
model. Feedback from the Working Group and Joint Teams was provided by
means of the member checking technique, where the collaboration model was
presented to the informants at diﬀerent stages of development to obtain their
input and support for further model development. Member checking is con-
sidered especially useful in our case because the ﬁndings made in observation
may change the collaboration model which further changes the way the Certus
partners collaborate [54]. Second threat to validity is representativeness, which
means that informants may not be representative of all relevant participants in
the collaboration. To mitigate this threat, we conducted participant observation
in diﬀerent settings involving participants with diﬀerent experience and exper-
tise. Software engineers and researchers were observed as part of Joint Teams,
managers were observed in focus group discussions and workshops. Third threat
to validity is the observer-expectancy eﬀect, which happens when the observer’s
presence aﬀects the informants’ behavior. To mitigate this threat, the observer
was taking notes on a laptop, trying to be as unobtrusive as possible.

External Validity. Our ﬁndings on industry-academia collaboration under-
pinning the Certus collaboration model are based on one speciﬁc collaborative

26

setting with a speciﬁc funding and governing scheme, untested in other environ-
ments, which limits the generalizability of our ﬁndings. Further work is neces-
sary to understand how well our model generalizes to other industry-academia
collaborative settings and how it could be adapted to other contexts.

7.3. Further Adaptation and Application

As already pointed out, we do not know how well the Certus model could
generalize to another collaboration context and what model modiﬁcation would
need to be made. Just like we experimented with its initial version and im-
proved it overtime, applying the model to another collaboration context would
be similar. It would take starting from the current version and adding addi-
tional elements on demand. Which elements would be needed depends on the
context. Even more, some of the elements available in the current model might
not be appropriate for a particular context and would be discontinued.
