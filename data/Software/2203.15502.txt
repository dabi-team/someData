To address the problem of imperfect confrontation strategy caused by the lack of information of game environment in the simulation
of non-complete information dynamic countermeasure modeling for intelligent game, the hierarchical analysis game strategy of
confrontation model based on OODA ring (Observation, Orientation, Decision, Action) theory is proposed. At the same time,
taking into account the trend of unmanned future warfare, NetLogo software simulation is used to construct a dynamic derivation
of the confrontation between two tanks. In the validation process, the OODA loop theory is used to describe the operation process
of the complex system between red and blue sides, and the four-step cycle of observation, judgment, decision and execution is
carried out according to the number of armor of both sides, and then the OODA loop system adjusts the judgment and decision
time coeﬃcients for the next confrontation cycle according to the results of the ﬁrst cycle. Compared with traditional simulation
methods that consider objective factors such as loss rate and support rate, the OODA-loop-based hierarchical game analysis can
analyze the confrontation situation more comprehensively.

Keywords: Non-complete Information Games; OODA Loop; NetLogo; Analytic Hierarchy Process.

Introduction

Modern warfare situations are ﬂuid and require rapid ad
hoc countermeasure decisions. Military technology is also
advancing with the development of artiﬁcial intelligence,
and the future warfare can be said to be dominated by the
participation of few combatants and the unmanned nature
of actual combat. Here to use NetLogo software simulation
to build a dynamic projection of both sides tanks in com-
plex terrain confrontation thought,1 both sides confronta-
tion terrain environment as shown in Figure 1.

The dynamic projection of the two sides’ tank con-
frontation in complex terrain is conceived as a situation
where the Red side is preparing to achieve a strike against
the Blue side’s chain of command in the complex terrain
of the mountain peaks and valleys, and the Blue side in-
tends to send a signiﬁcant portion of its armor numbers
to intervene in order to achieve the objective of stopping
the strike and maintain the intention of containing the Red
side’s course. After the Red side learns of the Blue side’s
strategic intent, it sends its absolute superior armor num-

bers to execute counter-intervention operations at the ﬁrst
opportunity. The OODA cycle connects the two sides in
the confrontation process, forming a complete game pro-
cess, and ﬁnally using hierarchical analysis to provide a
reference for the weight value of the mixed game strategy.
-Decision-action” cycle. The ”Orientation” and ”Decision”
steps are the most critical in the OODA cycle, and if the
enemy’s threat is misjudged or the surrounding environ-
ment is misunderstood, then the judgment and decision
will be wrong.2–5 The goal is to interfere with the enemy’s
OODA cycle by taking prompt action after the ﬁrst OODA
cycle is completed by the own side. In constructing a com-
plex combat system adversarial analysis, NetLogo modeling
software will be used to model the system dynamics of the
game process on both sides.6–11

2. Complex system confrontation model

construction theory

In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force Colonel Boyd proposed
the ”OODA Loop” theory. OODA is the abbreviation of
the four English words Observation, Orientation, Decision,
and Action. Its meaning is to observe, Orientation, make
decisions, and Action.11, 12The OODA Loop theory (Ob-
servation, Orientation, Decesion, Action) proposed by John
Boyd provides a way to describe conﬂicts in the cycle of de-
tection, judgment, decision-making, and action. Decision-
making processing is widely used in the study of military is-
sues. The OODA loop theory points out that the character-
istic of command and control operations is to ﬁght in accor-
dance with the observation-judgment-decision-action loop,
which can be divided into the following four stages: The
ﬁrst stage is observation (Observation), mainly through
various sensing equipment and The use of the network for
intelligence collection, for example, early warning detec-
tion information, battleﬁeld environment information, en-
emy coordinate information, etc. The second stage is Ori-
entation. The battleﬁeld situation is changing rapidly and
there is great uncertainty. Judgment is to convert data into
useful information. Eﬀective and rapid judgment of the re-
sults can assist the commander in making correct decisions
and even changes. The battleﬁeld situation. The third stage
is Decision, where the commander clearly formulates a mis-
sion plan and issues a battle plan. The rapid formation of
decision-making is of decisive signiﬁcance to the battleﬁeld
situation. The fourth stage is action. Actions on the bat-
tleﬁeld are usually described as taking corresponding oper-
ational deployments and performing actions based on the
operational plan issued by the superior.

The OODA Loop has periodicity and nesting. Period-
icity means that when a loop ends, another new loop be-
gins. The size of the period is related to the scale of combat
forces, spatial scope, and combat style; nesting means that
the loop and The loops are related in the form of nesting.
For example, in the tactical combat system, the smallest
OODA Loop is the ﬁrepower closed-loop control loop of the
close-range weapon system. There are also OODA Loops at
the unit level. These command and control loops are nested
within each other, and the inner loop The cycle is short and
the outer loop cycle is long.

In combat, the opposing parties will continuously ob-
serve the surrounding environment, obtain relevant infor-
mation, judge threats, make immediate adjustments, make
decisions, and take corresponding actions. This is speciﬁ-
cally reﬂected in the competition of OODA Loop response
capabilities. If they can try to shorten their own side The
enemy’s OODA Loop and increase the enemy’s OODA
Loop as much as possible. New actions are initiated be-
fore the enemy responds to its previous action, causing the
enemy to lose the ability to react, so that the initiative can
be mastered and a huge advantage can be obtained..The
schematic diagram of the OODA Loop is shown in Figure
2.

The ﬁrst is observation. Before the implementation of
command operations, a clear observation plan is required.
The two sides started by observing the new situation from
the beginning of the war and the reaction of the other side.
In the experiment, the red and blue sides were simulated
and designed for the OODA Loop, and the deployment
was judged by observing the strength of the opposing sides
before the war. The second is to judge and observe the sit-
uation and make reasonable decisions. In order to reﬂect

the process of dynamically deploying the amount of armor,
the slider value adjustment in the judgment and decision-
making link in N etLogo is used. At the end, the actual
output of the red and blue sides is used as the execution
link, and the amount of armor that needs to be dispatched
for the next OODA Loop is made according to the previous
three links.13–15

The OODA Loop is a closed ring for decision-making
and control actions, and it has the characteristics of a
periodic cycle. The law of future warfare is that combat
units that make quick judgments and decisions will take
the initiative. From the OODA Loop theory, it can be con-
cluded that the timeliness of military operations research.
Each time period of the system combat command cycle
depends on diﬀerent factors. λd and λf are deﬁned sepa-
rately as the mobile deployment rhythm and engagement
rhythm of the combat system in the physical domain.λC2
is the decision-making rhythm of the combat system in the
cognitive domain,λT is the rhythm of interaction between
the information domain, the physical domain, and the cog-
nitive domain,∆t1, ∆t2, ∆t3, ∆t4is deﬁned as the combat
time of the observation, judgment, decision-making and
action links of the OODA Loop,then complete the OODA
Loop and the time required for each link, as shown in Equa-
tion 1 and Equation 2.

The information entropy value of all OODA Loop of
a complex combat system is a system that increases as the
number of system cycles increases, indicating that the sys-
tem is a highly complex entropy increasing system and the
entropy value is in a state of divergence. For the highly com-
plex entropy increase system, Swarm, N etLogo and other
software are needed to assist the analysis. N etLogo has the
characteristics of simple model description language and
rapid modeling. In the third section, N etLogo modeling
speciﬁcally analyzes the process of confronting both par-
ties.

N etLogo6.1.1. Taking the construction of the red OODA
Loop as an example, the modeling is carried out from four
aspects: observation, judgment, decision-making and ac-
tion.The research of complex nonlinear combat with multi-
agent systems in modern combat is an important direction
of war simulation. NetLogo is a powerful multi-agent sim-
ulation tool, which greatly improves the simple analytical
model and analytical combat methods. Due to the simpli-
ﬁcation of the research, this article limits the combat pro-
cess to the micro process of OODA Loop combat. In the
future, the simulation can be extended and expanded to
achieve OODA Loop stacking and cumulative confronta-
tion. Use NetLogo to improve the level of human-computer
interaction, establish models and calculation formulas with
a higher degree of reduction, and analyze the process and
results of simulation operations to draw more credible eval-
uation conclusions. By analyzing the problems, ﬁnding the
gaps, laying the foundation for the formulation of com-
bat plans, so that simulation can truly serve the com-
bat decision-making. The functions of each module in the
OODA Loop are deﬁned as follows: Based on practical foun-
dation and facts, the diﬀerence in the amount of armor be-
tween the two opposing parties is relatively large, so the
party with the less armor will take a longer time to think
and need more time to deploy armor to achieve the goal of
winning with less. Select the value of the N etLogo slider for
the judgment and decision-making links of the red and blue
parties. For example, 500 armors of the red side and 400
armors of the blue side appear at one of the nodes of the
OODA Loop, and Then the red and blue sides in the Net-
Logo simulation software slider aﬃliation value is adjusted
to 1 and 0.5 respectively. as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4.

Investigation link

The reconnaissance behavior model mainly describes the
combat behavior of various detection,
reconnaissance
equipment and various sensing devices, which is the main
means to obtain intelligence information on the battleﬁeld.
In the OODA Loop, the information acquisition of the in-
vestigation link is related to the pre-war deployment, com-
mand and decision-making, etc. The Red investigation con-
sists of three modules, the speed at which the Red obtains
intelligence (RIS), the speed preventing the Red from ac-
quiring intelligence (BZuA), and the speed the Red actu-
ally obtains intelligence (R − Actual − S). The system dy-
namics module composed of the three modules is as shown
in Figure 5.

Fig. 5. Dynical model of Red Square investigation link.

3.2. Judgment link

This part of the OODA Loop is to analyze the collected in-
telligence, determine the authenticity of the intelligence,
and study the current situation. It is mainly completed
by the red judgment (RO) and the red judgment time
(ROT ime) in the combat elements of the command sys-
tem. It is an accusation The processing center of the infor-
mation ﬂow in the system. The red side judgment link is
composed of two modules, namely, red side judgment (RO)

and red side judgment ﬂow input (RIn). The system dy-
namics module composed of two modules is shown in Figure
6.

Fig. 6. Dynical model of red square judgment link.

3.3. Decision link

The decision-making link in the OODA Loop is based on
the situation judgment, assigning the action and task plan,
mainly by the red decision (RD) module in the combat ele-
ments of the accusation system, generating a new command
and control information ﬂow. The decision link consists of
red temporary storage module (RlinshiCun) and red de-
cision module (RD). The system dynamics model of the
decision-making link is shown in Figure 7.

The action link in the OODA Loop is the correspond-
ing action behavior based on the decision made and the
designated action plan, mainly through the red square

ule (RSunhaoxishu), the red side actual output module
(Redsshijishuchu), and the blue side Decision Module

OODA Loop

The simple system uses two inﬂuencing factors as the
OODA Loop of NetLogo simulation. Compared analysis
shows the diﬀerence between the two methods and whether
OODA Loop can improve operational thinking.

The dynamic model of the Observation, Orientation, Deci-
sion, Action link of the blue OODA Loop is shown in Figure
9 below.

4.1. Simple system

Assuming the amount of red and blue armor, the two sides
ﬁght according to certain rules of engagement. Both parties
then adjust their armor numbers and operational capabil-
ities to simulate their operations. The kinetic model of a
simple system is shown in F ig.10 and F ig.11.The combat
system is a complex system composed of personnel, equip-
ment, and organization. The combat process is aﬀected by

many factors such as combat missions, technical support,
logistical support, suddenness, morale, and command art.
It is very diﬃcult and tedious to comprehensively analyze
and model the factors in the combat process. Therefore,
the combat process is speciﬁcally abstracted as the link of
dynamic combat interaction, and only the system process
of red and blue tank confrontation is analyzed, which can
also play a good simulation role. By adjusting the number
and combat capabilities of the tanks on both sides, let them
conduct simulation operations.

Simulate the number of tanks on both sides, repre-
sented by R-Tank and G-Tank. As the confrontation be-
tween the two warring parties continues, the number of
tanks will show a certain consumption trend. If the num-
ber of subsequent tanks is supplemented, it will lead to a
certain decrease or increase in the scale of the tanks of both
sides. The confrontation between the two sides is a ﬁerce
process. The number of tanks is high. In order to ensure
the continuity of combat eﬀectiveness, continuous replen-
ishment of tank armor is required. R-Input and G-Input
are used to indicate the number of replenishment of the
red and blue sides. At the same time, use R- lost and G-
lost indicate the amount of equipment lost by both red and
blue. There are four variables in this model, namely the
loss rate of the red and blue tanks and the replenishment
rate of the red and blue tanks. R-lost-rate, G-lost-rate, R-
input-rate and G-input-rate are used respectively. Express.
In the process of this model test, the Red Army tanks are
replenishing (R-input) and losing (R-lost). The confronta-
tion is carried out step by step. Due to the short process
of modern warfare and the ﬁerce confrontation, the speed
of equipment replenishment is often lower than that of The
speed at which weapons and equipment are consumed.

Through simulation of red and blue OODA Loop by NetL-
ogo in Fig.5-Fig.9, the dynamic model of complex combat
system is shown in Figure 12, and the schematic diagram of
red and blue confrontation results of OODA Loop system
is shown in Figure 13.

4.3. OODA Loop system feasibility

veriﬁcation

The OODA cycle complex OS scheme is selected accord-
ing to the Operations Research Hierarchy Analysis Method
(The Analytic Hierarchy Process, or AHP). Hierarchical
analysis is a systematic and quantitative approach pro-
posed by operations strategist Professor T. L. Saaty in the
early 1970s.

The analytic hierarchy process refers to a complex
multi-objective decision-making problem as a system, the
goal is decomposed into multiple goals or criteria, and

then decomposed into multiple indicators (or criteria, con-
straints) several levels, through the qualitative index fuzzy
quantitative method to calculate the level Single rank-
ing (weight) and total ranking are used as a systematic
method for target (multi-index) and multi-scheme opti-
mization decision-making.The analytic hierarchy process is
to decompose the decision-making problem into diﬀerent
hierarchical structures in the order of the overall goal, the
sub-goals of each level, the evaluation criteria, and the spe-
ciﬁc investment plan, and then use the method of solving
the eigenvectors of the judgment matrix to obtain each level
The priority of an element to an element of the previous
level, and ﬁnally the weighted sum method is recursively
merged and the ﬁnal weight of each alternative plan to
the overall goal, and the one with the largest ﬁnal weight
is the optimal plan.The analytic hierarchy process is more
suitable for decision-making problems with hierarchical and
interlaced evaluation indicators, and the target value is dif-
ﬁcult to describe quantitatively.20

First OODA Loop complex CS scheme hierarchical hi-
erarchy, as shown in Figure 14. The hierarchical hierarchy
includes three levels, target, criterion and scheme. The tar-
get layer selects options for complex combat systems; the
criterion layer includes four modules: reconnaissance, judg-
ment, decision, and execution; the program layer includes

three schemes: support, continuation and retreat.

bat system plan.

Secondly, according to the scale value table of the analytic
hierarchy process, the consistency matrix of the complex
combat system plan to the four criterion modules (as shown
in T able2 and T able3) and the consistency matrix of the
three combat plans to each part of the OODA Loop are
constructed. Due to space limitations, here only the consis-
tency matrix of the four criterion modules of the complex
combat system plan and the selection weight matrix of the
complex combat system plan (as shown in Table 4) are

plans for each part of the OODA Loop The matrix will be

According to the selection weight matrix of the com-
plex combat system scheme, it can be concluded that in
the simulation combat, it is not the mode described by the
simple system. The two sides are simply ﬁghting, and the
amount of armor continues to decline; instead, through the
description of the combat mode like the OODA Loop, the
two sides Confrontation is a reciprocating process. At the
same time, the dynamic process of the zigzag ﬂuctuation of
the armor quantity shown in the schematic diagram of the
confrontation between the red and blue sides of the OODA
Loop system is veriﬁed from the side.

It can be concluded from T able4 that the weight ra-
tios of the three combat plans are respectively, the support
weight ratio is 0.5113, and the continued combat weight
and the retreat weight ratio are roughly the same. It shows
that when using the OODA Loop to analyze the combat
plan, the warring parties should support their own opera-
tions as much as possible, but the continued combat and
retreat plan also accounted for nearly half of the propor-
tion, and the choice to continue combat or retreat based on
the confrontation situation.

5. Conclusions

This paper simulates a complex environment combat model
based on OODA loop through NetLogo software and uses
hierarchical analysis to embody the game strategy under
three scenarios of attack, retreat, and continued reinforce-
ment that the red side should take after the current OODA
loop is executed in terms of the number of armor. It can be
concluded from the experimental results that the simula-
tion system of OODA loop is more exploratory and feasible
compared to the traditional simple system approach sim-
ulation. The OODA cycle is a correct practice of modern
military theory, and the full use of the OODA cycle can
form a closed-loop control of the combat confrontation and
make the combat analysis comprehensive and concrete.
